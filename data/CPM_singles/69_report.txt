 Forensic Science: Building Your Own Tool for Identifying DNA  When biologists want to separate different pieces of DNA, RNA, or proteins they use a technique called gel electrophoresis.
In this science project you'll build a gel electrophoresis chamber and use it to discover how many components are in different colors of food coloring dye.
A forensic scientist sits in her lab with three DNA samples in front of her.
One sample is the DNA left behind at the crime scene by the criminal; the other two samples are DNA from possible suspects.
How will she determine if either of the suspects' DNA matches the crime scene DNA?
The scientist knows she can use an enzyme to cut each DNA sample at a particular sequence of nucleotides; this will leave behind several different pieces of DNA.
The exact number of pieces and their sizes will be unique to each individual.
This means that there will be an exact match in the pattern of different-sized pieces of DNA between one of the suspects and the DNA left at the crime scene, but not to any other suspects' DNA.
The only problem left is, how will she "see" and "measure" the different pieces of DNA in each sample?
You might have seen such a scene on the television show CSI.
The answer is gel electrophoresis!
Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate and view macromolecules.
Macromolecules are "large" molecules, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins.
During gel electrophoresis, the macromolecules (DNA in the forensics example above) are loaded into a gel.
Then a current is applied across the gel.
The result is a separation of the macromolecules, based on mass.
In order to "see" the macromolecules in the gel, scientists add either dyes, which stain the area of the gel that contains the macromolecules, or chemicals that bind the macromolecules and fluoresce when the gel is exposed to ultraviolet light.So how does gel electrophoresis work?
It is based on the principal that nucleic acids, like DNA and RNA, are negatively charged.
This means that if you put nucleic acids in an electric field, they will migrate away from the negative end of the field and toward the positive end.
The nucleic acids are placed inside the gel for two main reasons.
One, the gel is a way of holding them to know where they are.
Two, the migration needs to occur in a manner that allows for the separation of different-sized pieces of DNA or RNA.
The gel has many microscopic holes through which the nucleic acids wiggle as they migrate within the electric field.
The smaller the nucleic acid sequence, the easier it is for it to wiggle through the holes.
So, smaller pieces of DNA and RNA "run" through the gel faster than larger pieces.
Returning to our forensic science example, this means that the individual pieces of DNA in each sample are sorted within the gelthe larger pieces appear at the top of the chamber and the smaller pieces appear at the bottom of the chamber.
The scientist compares the pattern of the pieces of the crime scene DNA to the pattern of the suspects' DNA and looks to see if there is an exact match.
Protein gel electrophoresis works similarly, except that proteins are not always negatively charged.
In order to force the proteins to migrate toward the positive end of the electric field, the proteins are denatured, forced to unfold, in the presence of a chemical that coats the protein in negative charges.
The amount of coating is relative to the size of the protein, which means that the total negative charge is greater in larger proteins.
Using this technique, proteins, like nucleic acids, can be separated based on mass.
Gel electrophoresis is a common technique in laboratories and has many uses, including the forensics example above.
The most common uses are:  Sorting pools of macromolecules to determine how many different macromolecules are in a sample.
Determining the exact size of a macromolecule.
This can be done by running a mixture of molecules of known sizes, called a ladder, in the same gel as the macromolecule you want to measure.
Then you can determine which known molecule in the ladder is closest in migration pattern to the unknown molecule; thus, approximate size.
Purifying a single type of macromolecule.
For example, a scientist may want to learn more about the proteins that a bacteria releases into the environment.
To do this, the scientist collects the liquid media the bacteria grows in and runs a sample of the media in a gel to look at how many proteins are in there.
Perhaps the scientist wants to know the identity of one of the proteins.
Based on size, the scientist may be able to guess what some of those proteins are; to check if he's right, the scientist can take advantage of the fact that the protein is now "trapped" in the gel.
By cutting out the region of the gel containing the protein that's the size he's interested in, and using other techniques to separate the gel from the protein, he can purify the protein and use that pure sample for further experimentation.
The equipment for gel electrophoresis is fairly simple.
There is a chamber to hold the actual gel.
The chamber has both positive and negative electrodes to which you connect a power source in order to create the electric field.
The gel is immersed in a buffer solution, which provides ions to carry the current and keeps the pH fairly constant.
The sample is loaded into wells in the gel.
Figure 1.
This gel electrophoresis chamber is connected to a power supply by black and red leads.
The red lead is attached to the positive electrode; the samples will run toward the positive electrode when the power is turned on.

In this science project you'll build your own gel electrophoresis chamber.
Once it is built, you'll be able to examine different food coloring dyes and explore some of the following questions.
For a preview of what the experiment will look like, watch the video below.
How many different macromolecules make up each food coloring dye?
Is there only one per color?
Which color runs through the gel fastest?
Do different brands of food dyes contain the same macromolecules?
You might be surprised by the results!
Watch this video,  http://www.youtube.com/watch/QWkfXjGohVk,  made by the Science Buddies Summer Fellows, for a preview of how to make your own gel electrophoresis chamber and use it to separate food coloring dyes into their macromolecular parts.
Electrophoresis may be a cutting-edge biotechnology technique, but the video proves you can still do it in an ordinary kitchen!
In this science project you will build your own gel electrophoresis chamber and use it to compare molecules in different colors of food coloring dye.
Are all food coloring dyes made from the same molecules?
Compare different brands of food coloring dyes.
Do they migrate the same distance over time?
Do they have the same color composition?What food dyes are in your favorite colored candies?
Use Bio-Rad's STEM Electrophoresis Kit to jump start your investigation.
You will need a teacher's help to order the kit as Bio-Rad sells directly to schools.What variables affect the rate of electrophoresis separation?
There are many variables to explore.
Several to start with might be the type of electrode, the amount of power, and the agar percentage of the gel.
Use your gel electrophoresis chamber to determine if two different types of plants use the same molecule for pigment.
To prepare your samples, take the flowers from a plant, grind up the flower, add a little bit of isopropyl alcohol, and continue grinding.
Once the solids settle, pour the pigment-tinted alcohol into a separate container.
Let most of the alcohol evaporate and then add a drop or two of your buffer solution to reconstitute the pigment.
Try combining this experiment with one of the DNA extraction science projects like the Do-It-Yourself DNA or the  Extracting Onion DNA Science Buddies project ideas.
Can you see the DNA you extracted on your gel?
Are there different bands?
Note: you will need to use a stain to visualize the DNA.
DNA stains are available from online science supply companies, like Science Kit catalog #WW6488701 or Wards Natural Science catalog #38 V 9014.
