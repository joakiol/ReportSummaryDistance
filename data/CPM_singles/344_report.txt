 Rainbow Fire  Astronomers can figure out what distant stars are made of (in other words, their atomic composition) by measuring what type of light is emitted by the star.
In this science project, you can do something similar by observing the color of flames when various chemicals are burned.
All matter is made of atoms.
Atoms have a nucleus, which consists of protons and neutrons, and is surrounded by electrons.
The nucleus is concentrated in a very small space, about 10-15 m. An entire atom is on the order of 10-10 m, so the electrons are relatively far from the nucleus, and, strangely enough, atoms are mostly empty space.Physicists have found that the electrons traveling around the atomic nucleus can have only certain amounts of energy, called energy levels.
In other words, the energy levels of atomic electrons are quantized.
If electrons gain energy, they can move from one energy level up to a higher level, but these different energy levels are not continuousthey come in discrete steps.
(Watch the animation in Figure 1, below, to see an electron gain energy and move up to a higher energy level.)
This fundamental discovery is known as quantum mechanics.
Quantum mechanics describes how an atom's electrons interact with electrons of other atoms and with photons.
Figure 1.
In this animation, the red circle represents an atom's nucleus and the blue circle is an electron orbiting around the atom.
The black rings are different energy levels the electron can be at.
When the electron gains energy (represented by the red arrow going towards the electron), the electron moves to a higher energy level.
When the electron loses energy (represented by the red arrow moving away from the electron), the electron moves to a lower energy level.
(Animation credits: Kurzon)Atomic electrons at higher energy levels can also lose energy, dropping down to a lower energy level.
(You can also see this in the animation in Figure 1, above.)
Again, the electron moves from one allowed energy state to another.
The lost energy can be carried away in the form of heat (vibrational energy) or in the form of lightwhen the electron reverts to a lower energy state, a photon of light is produced.
The photon produced will have an energy equal to the difference between the electron's initial high energy state and the later lower-energy state.
For visible light, we perceive these differences in photon energy as differences in the color of the light.
Because different types of atoms have different gaps between their energy levels, they make light of different colors when their electrons lose energy.Not only can astronomers use this knowledge to figure out the atomic composition of distant stars, but it can also be used to create fireworks shows.
Have you ever watched a fireworks show and wondered how all the different colors  amazing reds, yellows, oranges, blues, purples, greens, and more  are made?
The color, or colors, that a firework makes depends on what chemicals are in the firework.
These chemicals are various metal compounds that burn when the firework goes off, and burning the compounds is what makes the colors, like the ones shown in Figure 2, below.
Figure 2.
The beautiful colors of fireworks, like the ones shown here, are the result of atomic electrons emitting energy as light.
(Image credits: Semnoz)In this science project, you will use a procedure that is similar to flame photometry or a flame test to observe the color of light produced when various metal compounds are burned.
You will need an adult to help you with this experiment, and you will have to perform the experiment extremely carefully so that the flames stay small and under control.
What colors will different chemical compounds produce?
To investigate the colors produced when different chemicals are burned.
You could try this science project using other metal compounds known to produce certain flame colors when burned.
Check out the resources in the Bibliography section in the Background for some ideas on how to do this.
Be sure to always look into and follow all proper safety precautions when handling and burning different chemicals.
What colors do other metal compounds make when burned?

I learned that science projects can be really fun and exciting when it deals with determining which color a chemical will produce when you only think that the only color a flame can be is yellow or orange.
What problems did you encounter?
No problems necessary if you had adult supervision and was very careful.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
No.

I learned that elemental compounds do, in fact, change the flame color.
I also learned a lot about spectral lines.
What problems did you encounter?
None Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
I found that researching flame photometry was a bit hard.
I eventually think I got it, but I'm still not sure I have the right idea.
Also, inteas of using pincones, I used pine wood shavings.
I did this because I did not want to use the same experiment, and I felt and had to alter it slightly.
In fact, my results proved much better than someone else in my class who had done your same experiment.
I'm glad I used the wood shavings rather than the pine cones.

The most important thing I must have learned during Rainbow Fire was all these really cool things about atoms and photons and a nucleus.
At first, it was pretty hard to understand, but then I got the hang of it.
What problems did you encounter?
Pinecones were not readily available, and they weren't a good variable to use for burning, so instead I used wooden sticks.
I didn't encounter any problems with fire- it's really not such a big deal.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
I suggest that instead of pinecones, you should try just pieces of wood.
They're cheaper and easier to find.

The most important thing we learned was how the chemical composition causes a change in the color of the flame.
Also you learn a lot about fire and how easy it is to cause a mishap when you mix different seemingly safe chemicals.
What problems did you encounter?
The biggest issue was finding the right chemical composition for the powders that could be used to generated the colors Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
Maybe a standard recommendation of where to get the chemicals from to ensure a certain wuality of results.

I learned that fire can burn with unusual, beautiful colors if it's burning the right chemicals.
What problems did you encounter?
I tried it once before and it seemed there was little change between colors of fire.
But this time it worked!
