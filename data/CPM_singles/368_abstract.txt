matter and its interactions - ps3.a: definitions of energy	matter and its interactions - ps3.a: definitions of energy The temperature of a system is proportional to the average internal kinetic energy and potential energy per atom or molecule ( whichever is the appropriate building block for the systemâ€™s material ) .
The details of that relationship depend on the type of atom or molecule and the interactions among the atoms in the material .
Temperature is not a direct measure of a system 's total thermal energy .
The total thermal energy ( sometimes called the total internal energy ) of a system depends jointly on the temperature , the total number of atoms in the system , and the state of the material .
