The organism begins as a single cell ( fertilized egg ) that divides successively to produce many cells , with each parent cell passing identical genetic material ( two variants of each chromosome pair ) to both daughter cells .
Cellular division and differentiation produce and maintain a complex organism , composed of systems of tissues and organs that work together to meet the needs of the whole organism .
