 No Pain, Lots of Game  You might have heard the expression, "Take two aspirin, and call me in the morning."
What if instead a doctor said, "Play two video games and call me in the morning"?
Would you be shocked?
Or think it was time for a new doctor?
In this science fair project, you'll investigate whether video games, and other forms of mental distraction, have the power to relieve pain.
Have you ever come home from playing a rough game of sports and looked down and found a bad scrape on your knee?
You realize you have no idea when or how you got hurt, because you felt nothing at the time, even though your knee may be really stinging now.
This is an example of how distraction can relieve pain, that uncomfortable feeling you get when you are sick or injured.
You don't like pain, of course, but it is very important to your survival.
Without it, you'd be injuring yourself all the time without even knowing it.
Your brain knows there is pain when electrical warning signals are sent from the point of injury or disease all the way to your brain.
As shown in Figure 1, the electrical signals start when special receptor cells, on the ends of peripheral nerve fibers, identify that injury or damage is taking place.
These receptor cells send out their warning signals along the peripheral nerve fibers, which then carry the signal to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, which is the major highway for relaying signals to the brain.
Once in the brain, the pain signal is sent out to your brain's physical sensation center, emotional center, and thinking center, so you can decide what to do about it!
Figure 1.
This drawing shows the pain pathway from the point of injury on a hand to the brain.
(Dr. David L. Nelson, 2008.)
Not all pain signals reach the brain though.
There are special gatekeeper cells in the spinal cord that can reduce or even block out the pain signals.
For example, after you bump your knee, you might rub it.
The signals sent by rubbing and touching the injured area affect the gatekeeper cells.
They turn down the intensity of the pain signal, and reduce the sensation of pain.
The brain can also affect the gatekeepers.
The brain can produce special chemicals called endorphins and enkephalins, which prompt the gatekeepers to dial down the pain.
How, or even if, you experience the sensation of pain is very complex and controlled by many factors, including your emotions, culture, genetics, age, gender, past experiences, and environment.
For example, if you are hurt while you are tired, or in a nervous or worried state of mind, you will often have a greater sensation of pain, but if you are hurt while playing sports and your mind is focused on the game, you will often have a lesser sensation of pain.Doctors and nurses use pain medications called analgesics to try and relieve pain.
Depending on the type of pain, there are many other forms of pain relief that they may advise, too, including cold packs or warm baths, massage, acupuncture, yoga breathing techniques, meditation, mental imagery, and distraction.
Distraction in the form of video games is now commonly used for burn patients who have to endure very painful daily treatments for their burns.In this science fair project, you will test whether or not video games can increase your tolerance to unpleasant, cold ice water.
So brace yourself!
Your toes are about to take the polar bear dive!
In this science fair project, you will investigate if playing video games reduces the sensation of pain.
Compare TV- or DVD-viewing with video games to see if passive distraction (TV/DVD) is better or worse at increasing tolerance to the ice water than the active distraction of playing video games.
Compare two forms of active distraction, such as playing video games with surfing the Internet, to see if one is better at increasing tolerance to unpleasant stimulation.
Compare types of video games; for example, is an action-packed video game better at increasing pain tolerance than a card or puzzle video game?
Compare gender differences: Do certain video games increase pain tolerance better in girls than in boys, or vice versa?
Compare auditory with visual distraction to see which is better at increasing tolerance to pain.

That some people won't tell you if they're in pain just so they can keep playing games.
We had to do experiments multiple times to test if they were being honest.

I learned that distracting the pain will effect the pain from your foot.
What problems did you encounter?
The one problem that I encountered was that some of the volunteers were scared to put their feet in the cold water and that the pain really hurt them.
The videogame did effect the pain a lot.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
At first I didn't want to do the work, but then I got into it and it was very fun.
The only thing I might suggest is that you start early because it might take a while to start.
IF you want to make it look really cool I suggest that you do a lot of extra work on this fun project.
The project is really fun and you will learn a lot of facts about pain you didn't know before.

When no distraction is present, the subject can hold their foot in the water longer.
What problems did you encounter?
There had to be an even number of boys and girls.
People couldn?t be allergic to the cold, and I needed a handheld gaming device.
I also may need a DS??
or PSP??
