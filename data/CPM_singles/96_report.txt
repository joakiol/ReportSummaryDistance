 Plop, Plop, Fizz Fast: The Effect of Temperature on Reaction Time  Alka-Seltzer tablets fizzle furiously when dropped into water.
The moment the tablet starts dissolving, a chemical reaction occurs that releases carbon dioxide gas.
In this science project, you can even measure how long and loudly your tablet fizzes using Google's Science Journal app.
Do you think you can make Alka-Seltzer fizz faster or more loudly by changing the temperature of the water?
How big of a difference in the rate of a chemical reaction can temperature make?
You may have seen a television commercial for Alka-Seltzer tablets, or heard one of their advertising slogans: "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it is!"
When you drop the tablets in water, they make a lot of bubbles, like an extra-fizzy soda, as shown in Figure 1 below.
And like a soda, the bubbles are carbon dioxide gas (CO2).
However, with Alka-Seltzer, the CO2 is produced by a chemical reaction that occurs when the tablets dissolve in water.Figure 1.
When an Alka-Seltzer tablet comes in contact with water, the tablet makes carbon dioxide gas through a chemical reaction  (Image credit: by Ebarella_R, via Flickr).Alka-Seltzer is a medical drug that works as a pain reliever and an antacid (antacids help neutralize stomach acidity, such as heartburn).
The pain reliever used is aspirin and the antacid used is baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3).
To take the tablets, they should be fully dissolved in a glass of water.
When sodium bicarbonate dissolves in water, it dissociates (splits apart) into sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions.
(An ion is a molecule that has a charge, either positive or negative.)
The bicarbonate reacts with hydrogen ions (H+) from citric acid (another ingredient in the tablets) to form carbon dioxide gas and water.
In other words, carbon dioxide gas is a product of this reaction.
The reaction is described by Equation 1 below:Equation 1.3HCO3+3H+3H2O+3CO2  {3HCO_{3}}^{-} + 3H^{+} \rightarrow 3H_{2}O + 3CO_{2}  [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]So how is temperature related to this bicarbonate reaction?
In order for the reaction shown above to occur, the bicarbonate ions have to come into contact with the hydrogen ions.
Molecules in a solution are in constant motion, and are constantly colliding with one another.
The hydrogen and bicarbonate ions must collide at the right angle and with enough energy for the reaction to occur.
The temperature of a solution is a measure of the average motion (kinetic energy) of the molecules in the solution.
The higher the temperature, the faster the molecules are moving.
What effect do you think temperature will have on the speed, or rate, of the bicarbonate reaction?
In this chemistry science project you will find out for yourself by plopping Alka-Seltzer tablets into water at different temperatures, and measuring how long it takes for the chemical reaction to go to completion.
In addition, you can record the sound of the Alka-Seltzer fizzle.
Do you think it will fizz more loudly in hot or cold water?
To measure the effect of temperature on the rate of a chemical reaction.
More advanced students should also calculate the   standard deviation of the reaction times for each temperature.
Use the standard deviation to add error bars to your graph.
For example, say that the average reaction time for one temperature was 45 seconds, and the standard deviation was 5.2 seconds (these are made-up numbers).
You would graph the symbol for the data point at 45 seconds, and then draw short vertical bars above and below the symbol.
Each vertical bar would have a length equivalent to 5.2 seconds.
Error bars give your audience a measure of the     variance in your data.
Adult supervision required.
Is reaction rate predictable over a larger temperature range?
Water remains liquid above 0C and below 100C.
Repeat the experiment at one or more additional high temperatures to find out.
Use Pyrex glass for containing water heated on the stove or in the microwave, and use appropriate care (e.g.
wear hot mitts and safety goggles) when handling hot water.
A standard candy thermometer should be able to measure the temperatures in this higher range.
You could turn the bicarbonate reaction into a home-made lava lamp.
To do this, you will want to use a tall jar or empty clear plastic 1-liter or 2-liter bottle, fill it with 2 to 5 centimeters (cm) of water, add 5 drops of food coloring, and then fill it at least three-quarters full with vegetable oil.
You could repeat the science project using your home-made lava lamp at a cold and a hot temperature.
To do this, you will need to figure out a way to make the prepared bottle hot or cold.
(For example, to make it hot you could let it sit in a large bowl of hot water, and to make it cold you could store it in a refrigerator or freezer.)
You will also want to use one-quarter of an Alka-Seltzer tablet at a time (instead of a whole tablet).
How does the bicarbonate reaction look and function in the home-made lava lamp?
In this science project you observed the reaction mixture and watched as the tablets disappeared and formed gas bubbles.
For more advanced versions of this experiment, you can build a simple apparatus so that you can measure the volume of the gas produced over time.
Because you will be able to collect data at multiple time points, you get information about how the reaction rate changes over time.
For more advanced versions of measuring the reaction rate like this, see these Science Buddies projects:     How Fast Does an Alka-Seltzer Tablet Make Gas?
Can You Change the Rate of a Chemical Reaction by Changing the Particle Size of the Reactants?.
Does changing the particle size of the reactants have as big an effect on reaction time as changing the temperature of the water does?
For a science project that investigates the effect of particle size on the speed of the reaction, see the Science Buddies project    Big Pieces or Small Pieces: Which React Faster?

The hotter the water, the faster the alka-seltzer will react and dissolve.
This happens because there is more energy in the hot water and the molecules are moving faster.
So, the faster molecules, the more energy, and the more energy, the faster the alka-seltzer will disolve.
What problems did you encounter?

You should specify how hot/cold the water needs to be.
Other than that the project was very basic.
The project was completed in seconds.
It had one central idea about energy.

I learned how temperature can affect the rate of a chemical reaction.
This project illustrated the effects of temperature on reaction rate in a very simple way--alka-seltzer tablets and water of various temperatures.
What problems did you encounter?
At the end of the Alka-Seltzer's dissolution process, the tablet rises to the water's surface and disintegrates completely.
In the test condition using ice water, the tablet could not rise to the surface because the ice was in the way.
This may have slightly influenced the amount of time that the tablet took to dissolve when compared to the other temperature conditions.
I would add the following sentence to step 4b.
in the experimental procedure: "Once temperature has equilibrated, remove the ice cubes from the water's surface using a spoon or other utensil immediately before adding the Alka-Seltzer tablet."
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
See above.
Also- The introduction contains the appropriate amount of detail for the project's level of difficulty.
The steps in the procedure are clear and the data table provided is helpful.
I completed this project in under a day and spent less than $20 on materials.
