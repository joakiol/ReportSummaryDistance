 Make a Battery with Metal, Air, and Saltwater!
Have you ever wondered how your cell phone or laptop keeps running once you unplug it?
Sure, it is the battery that makes your portable electronics work, but how exactly does a battery do that, and from where does the electricity come?
Generally, in a battery chemical energy is converted into electrical energy.
In fact, many different types of batteries exist that are all based on a different set of chemical reactions.
In this science project, you will explore a special battery variant called the metal air batteryspecifically, a zinc-air battery, sometimes also called a saltwater battery.
How much electric current do you think it can generate?
If you need to power something on the go without an electric cord, what do you do?
Rely on a battery, of course.
You already know that batteries come in all sizes and shapes (Figure 1), from large car batteries to tiny hearing-aid batteries.
But, what makes a battery work?
Probably something complicated, right?
Well, it does get complicated, but the basic idea is pretty simple.
So simple that you can make a battery at home out of saltwater, metal, and air!
But first, let us explore how a battery works.

(Image credit: by Lead holder, via Wikimedia Commons) There is one thing that all batteries have in common; they consist of one or several electrochemical, or galvanic cells that are embedded in the battery container and that generate the electricity for all electrical devices connected.
But what is a "galvanic cell"?
It is a device that can generate electrical energy from chemical reactions.
In general, electricity is defined as "the presence of an electric charge," which can be either positive or negative.
An electric current is the flow of moving charges (usually in the form of electrons or ions) through an electric circuit.
In a battery, the galvanic cell usually consists of two electrodes, usually made from metals or carbon, which are in contact with an electrolyte, as shown in Figure 2.
The electrodes, as well as the electrolyte, both need to be electrically conductive to allow electrons and ions to flow through an external wire or load from one electrode to the other.
Within the electrolyte, the charges are generally carried by ions, whereas electrons carry the charge through the electrodes into the external wires and the load that the battery is connected with.
The question now is where do the electrons come from?
Here is where the chemistry comes into play.
Electrons are generated through chemical reactions, called redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions, where negative charges (in the form of electrons) are transferred from one chemical to another.
There are many different battery types that use different chemical reactions to generate electrons.
Two common examples are the lithium ion battery or nickel cadmium battery.
The voltage, or electric potential difference, that a battery can generate is mainly determined by the redox reactions that take place at both electrodes.
By definition, the electrode at which the oxidation reaction happens, is called the anode, whereas the electrode at which the reduction reaction happens is called the cathode.
During an oxidation reaction, a chemical compound loses an electron.
This lost electron is transferred to another chemical compound, which then takes it up in a reduction reaction.
Figure 2.
In a galvanic cell, two electrodes are in contact with an electrolyte.
Due to the electrical potential difference of the redox reactions at the anode and cathode, a voltage is generated between the electrodes, which induces an electron flow from the anode into an external wire through a load into the cathode.
In the electrolyte, charges are carried by cations (positively charged) and anions (negatively charged).
The battery type that you will explore in this science project is called a metal air battery or, more specifically, a zinc-air battery, sometimes also referred to as a saltwater battery.
The zinc-air battery is a relatively mature technology and is most commonly used in hearing aids and watches due to its high energy density.
The zinc-air battery that you will create has a zinc anode, a copper cathode, and saltwater as an electrolyte.
Commercial zinc-air batteries use zinc powder as the anode, a porous carbon cathode, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as the electrolyte, but the basic chemical reactions are the same.
The name already hints at the chemical reactions that drive this battery; the zinc metal at the anode gets oxidized and releases electrons that are transferred to the copper cathode.
Here, the electrons are taken up by oxygen (O2) from the air that is dissolved in the electrolyte.
Once it comes in contact with the surface of the copper electrode inside the electrolyte, the oxygen is reduced to hydroxyl ions (OH-).
As you can see from the chemical equations below, the copper electrode is not participating in this reaction, but instead, functions as a catalyst that facilitates the oxygen reduction.
For more detailed information about the zinc-air battery chemistry, see the Technical Note at the end of this introduction.Anode (oxidation): ZnZn2++2e Zn  \rightarrow \ Zn^{2+}  +  2 \ e^-  [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]Cathode (reduction):O2+2H2O+4e4OH  O_2 + 2 \ H_2O + 4 \ e^-  \rightarrow  4 \ OH^-  [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]The need for a continuous oxygen supply as a fuel makes the metal air battery a cross between a traditional battery and a fuel cell, which runs on hydrogen and oxygen.
As oxygen is usually not very soluble in liquids like saltwater, the flow of electronsor the current output of your batterywill be limited by the availability of oxygen at the copper cathode.
In this science project, you will explore how you can improve the flow of electrons in your battery using different methods (mechanical and chemical) that are aimed toward increasing the oxygen concentration in your electrolyte.
How much current do you think your battery can generate?
Technical Note: Chemistry of the zinc-air batteryThe chemical reactions that happen at the electrodes of a galvanic cell determine the voltage a battery can generate.
The electrical potential difference between the anode and the cathode induces an electron flow and thus, generates electric current.
In a zinc-air battery, the electrons are derived from the zinc anode that, once in contact with the electrolyte, releases electrons in the following oxidation reaction (Reaction 1).
Anode (oxidation): Reaction 1:  ZnZn2++2e Zn  \rightarrow Zn^{2+} + 2 \ e^-  [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]Reaction 2: Zn2++2OHZn(OH)2 Zn^{2+}  +  2 \ OH^-  \rightarrow Zn(OH)_2 [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]  Reaction 3: Zn(OH)2ZnO+H2O Zn(OH)_2  \rightarrow ZnO + H_2O [Please enable JavaScript to view equation] The zinc joins the electrolyte as positive ions (Zn2+) where they combine with hydroxyl ions (OH-) to form insoluble zinc hydroxide (Zn(OH)2), as shown in Reaction 2.
Zinc hydroxide can then decompose into zinc oxide (ZnO) and water (H2O), as shown in Reaction 3.
In an alkaline electrolyte, such as potassium hydroxide, which is used in commercial zinc-air batteries, the zinc ions will react with the excess hydroxyl ions to form soluble zincate ions (Zn(OH)42-), as shown in Reaction 4.
At a lower pH, or once the electrolyte is over saturated with zincate ions, these ions decompose into insoluble zinc oxide and water (Reaction 5).Reaction 4: Zn2++4OHZn(OH)24 Zn^{2+} + 4 \ OH^- \rightarrow Zn(OH)_4^{2-} [Please enable JavaScript to view equation] Reaction 5: Zn(OH)24ZnO+H2O+2OH Zn(OH)_4^{2-} \rightarrow ZnO  + H_2O + 2 \ OH^- [Please enable JavaScript to view equation] In addition to these electrochemical reactions, the zinc electrode can also corrode in a parasitic reaction that does not contribute to the generation of electric current, and creates hydrogen gas, as shown in Reaction 6.Reaction 6:Zn+2H2OZn(OH)2+H2 Zn + 2 \ H_2O \rightarrow Zn(OH)_2 + H_2 [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]  The electrons that are left behind from the zinc electrode flow through an external wire into a load, such as an LED, and then into the copper electrode.
There, oxygen from the surrounding air that is dissolved in the electrolyte, takes up the electrons (gets reduced) at the surface of the copper and forms hydroxyl ions.
The copper itself is not participating in this reaction, as can be seen in Reaction 7, but instead reacts as a catalyst that facilitates the oxygen reduction process.
Cathode (reduction): Reaction 7:O2+2H2O+4e4OH  O_2 + 2 \ H_2O + 4 \ e^-  \rightarrow 4 \ OH^- [Please enable JavaScript to view equation] Combining the anode and cathode reactions results in the overall net reaction that takes place in a zinc-air battery and can be described as: Net reaction:  Reaction 8:2Zn2++O22ZnO 2 \ Zn^{2+} + O_2 \rightarrow 2 \ ZnO [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]  Once you add additional chemicals to the electrolyte, such as hydrogen peroxide, bleach, or a different salt, the battery chemistry can change depending on if this chemical compound is electrochemically active or not.
In the case of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which you will use in this experiment, two things can happen.
First, as H2O2 is not very stable in water (especially in the presence of transition metals), it will decompose into oxygen and water according to Reaction9.Reaction 9: 2H2O2O2+2H2O 2 \ H_2O_2  \rightarrow O_2 + 2 \ H_2O  [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]  At the same time, however, hydrogen peroxide can also react electrochemically with the cathode.
Thus, instead of oxygen, H2O2 is taking up electrons from the copper electrode and forms hydroxyl ions (Reaction 10).
This results in a change of the battery chemistry, which leads to a different cell voltage.
Reaction 10: H2O2+2e2OH H_2O_2 + 2 \ e^- \rightarrow 2 \ OH^- [Please enable JavaScript to view equation] Investigate the chemistry of a saltwater zinc-air battery, and measure how much voltage and current it can make.
Can you find different ways of improving the performance of your zinc-air battery?
Test if you get higher cell voltages and currents when adding other chemicals to your electrolyte, such as bleach, vinegar, or different salts such as Epsom salt.
Will these additions change the cell chemistry?
Do your own research or read through the references in the Bibliography to find out how the electrode reactions can change when adding different chemicals.The electrolyte of a battery has an important function.
It has to be electrically conductive to be able to move charges from one electrode to the other as cations or anions.
In your experiments, these are the sodium and chloride ions of the table salt (NaCl).
What happens if you leave out the salt and only use tap water as the electrolyte?
Will the battery work when you use distilled water that has most ions removed?
How does your battery performance vary with different salt concentrations?Adding more chemicals to your electrolyte is only one way of changing the cell chemistry.
What if you switched the electrode materials with a different metal?
Try to exchange the zinc anode with an aluminum metal strip that you can cut out from a disposable aluminum tray, or just use aluminum foil as an electrode.
How does the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current change in this battery setup?
What are the anode and cathode reactions in this case?How does the zinc-air battery perform over a longer period of time?
Let your whole battery setup (as shown in Figure 5 in the Procedure) run for several days and evaluate the battery performance (measuring open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current) twice a day.
Does the voltage or the current change a lot?
Observe both electrodes over time; what do you notice?
Can your zinc-air battery create enough power to light up an LED?
Use the red LED that comes with the Veggie Power Kit and find out.
You can also connect several zinc-air batteries in series or parallel if one battery is not enough.
See the Science Buddies project Potato Battery: How to Turn Produce into Veggie Power!
for more details.
How many batteries do you think you will need?
Does the LED get brighter with blowing bubbles?How does the current of your zinc-air battery vary over time during all your different treatments?
Instead of just writing down the short-circuit current at the beginning of your treatment and after 3minutes, monitor the current over time from 05 minutes and record the values every 30seconds.
Make a graph showing the time on the x-axis and the current values on the y-axis.
Do you see a difference between the individual treatments?
