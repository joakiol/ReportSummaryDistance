 Big Pieces or Small Pieces: Which React Faster?
Some chemical reactions occur explosively fast, others may occur almost imperceptibly s-l-o-w-l-y.
This project explores what effect the particle size of the reactants has on the speed of a chemical reaction: production of carbon dioxide gas by an Alka-Seltzer tablet.
You may have seen a television commercial for Alka-Seltzer tablets, or heard one of their advertising slogans: "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it is!"
When you drop the tablets in water, they make a lot of bubbles, like an extra-fizzy soda.
And like a soda, the bubbles are carbon dioxide gas (CO2).
However, with Alka-Seltzer, the CO2 is produced by a chemical reaction that occurs when the tablets dissolve in water.The main ingredients of Alka-Seltzer tablets are aspirin, citric acid, and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3).
When sodium bicarbonate dissolves in water, it dissociates (splits apart) into sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3) ions.
The bicarbonate reacts with hydrogen ions (H+) from the citric acid to form carbon dioxide and water.
The reaction is described by the following chemical equation: So how does particle size come into this?
In order for the reaction shown above to take place, the ingredients in the tablet first have to dissolve.
The table has a large surface area, so this step should be pretty fast, right?
What effect do you think particle size will have on the speed of the bicarbonate reaction?
You can find out for yourself by plopping prepared Alka-Seltzer tablets (whole tablets, halved tablets, quartered tablets, and powdered tablets) into water at the same temperature, and timing how long it takes for the chemical reaction to go to completion.
The goal of this project is to measure the effect of reactant particle size on the rate of a chemical reaction.
More advanced students should also calculate the standard deviation of the reaction times for each temperature.
Use the standard deviation to add error bars to your graph.
For example, say that the average reaction time for one particle size was 45 seconds, and the standard deviation was 5.2 seconds (these are made-up numbers).
You would graph the bar for the data point at 45 seconds, and then draw short vertical bars above and below the top of the bar.
Each vertical bar would have a length equivalent to 5.2 seconds.
Error bars give your audience a measure of the variance in your data.
Does changing the particle size of the reactants have as big an effect as changing the temperature of the water?
For an experiment that investigates the effect of temperature on the speed of the reaction, see the Science Buddies project Plop, Plop, Fizz Fast: The Effect of Temperature on Reaction Time.
In this experiment you observed the reaction mixture and watched as the tablets disappeared and formed gas bubbles.
For more advanced versions of this experiment, you can build a simple apparatus so that you can measure the volume of the gas produced over time.
Because you will be able to collect data at multiple time points, you get information about how the reaction rate changes over time.
For more advanced versions of measuring the reaction rate, see the Science Buddies projects:   How Fast Does an Alka-Seltzer Tablet Make Gas?, and  Can You Change the Rate of a Chemical Reaction by Changing the Particle Size of the Reactants?.

The powdered tablets dissolved WAY faster than the whole, half, or fourths of tablets.
Alka-Seltzer should consider making their tablets into powder so people in pain could relieve their pain faster.
I enjoyed watching the tablets dissolve and my hypothesis about this project was right: the powdered tablets dissolved faster than any of the other tablets.
Thank you Science Buddies!
-A fellow scientist :)P.S.
This was my very first experiment so I give all the credit to this website for making me want to do more experiments.
I can't thank you enough for this new love of science!
What problems did you encounter?
The only problems that occurred were when I put the powder in my container, it got stuck in the container and I had to use the spoon to get it out!
Also, the temperatures of the different water I was testing was different so I had to kind of dismiss that fact.
Otherwise there were no problems at all!
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
An idea for another experiment similar to this one is to test different types of liquid (water, vinegar, lemon juice, etc.).
Another idea is to test different temperatures of water such as hot water, room temperature water, and cold water.
Other than these ideas, there are no improvements.
Science Buddies rocks!

It  has  be  nice to learn  some  statistic with these easy and cheap experiment.

I learned how the particle size of reactants in a chemical reaction (in this case, alka-seltzer tablets) can affect the rate of the reaction.
The project introduction contains the appropriate amount of detail for the project's level of difficulty.
Objective is simple and clear.
What problems did you encounter?
noneI spent less than one day on this project and materials cost less than $20.
Materials were easy to obtain and all safety measures/concerns were described.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
1) The experimental procedure calls for students to use a hammer and scrap wood to crush the tablet into a powder.
I was able to make a powder simply by folding the tablet into a piece of paper and using the back of an ice cream scoop or large spoon to crush it.Edit, step 4d: "You can also use the back of a metal spoon or ice cream scoop to carefully crush your tablet into a powder once it is wrapped in paper if you do not want to use a hammer and piece of wood.
May take more time to crush."
2) Broken Links: Bayer Health Care, updated link http://www.alka-seltzer.com/as/student_experiment1.htmlChem Experiments at Home, Daytona Beach CC: Could not find updated link3) In my opinion, this project should be marked as difficulty 3 or 3-4.
