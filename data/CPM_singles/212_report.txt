 Yeasty Beasties  While looking at a package of dry yeast it is hard to believe that the package has organisms in it that are alive.
But add the right ingredients and presto, the mixture becomes a bubbly, oozing, mess of life!
What are the right ingredients?
What does that yeast need to become active?
Do this science project and figure it out for yourself!
Yeasts are tiny, microscopic organisms  or microorganisms  that are a type of fungus.
This means that they are more closely related to a mushroom than to plants, animals, and bacteria (which are also microorganisms).
You can see a picture of some yeasts in Figure 1, below.
These little critters might sound strange and different, but people have actually been using them for thousands of years to make bread "rise."
How does this work?
It has to do with the metabolism of the yeasts, or, in other words, what they eat and what they turn that food into.
Figure 1.
This image shows what individual yeasts look like using a powerful microscope.
These are specifically baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).Yeasts must get their food from their surrounding environment to grow and reproduce, or make more yeast.
What do they eat?
Yeasts feed on sugars and starches, which are in bread dough.
They turn their food into energy and release carbon dioxide (CO2) gas as a result.
This process is known as fermentation.
The CO2 gas made during fermentation is what makes a slice of bread so soft and spongy.
The pockets of gas are produced by yeasts when the dough is allowed to rise before baking.
Fermentation is also used to make beer, wine, and champagne.
In this microbiology science project, you will grow yeasts in different conditions to see which cause the yeasts to be most active during fermentation.
Some of the conditions you will test will change the pH of the environment that the yeasts will be grown in.
pH is a scale that measures how acidic or how basic something is.
A base has a pH that is above 7, such as baking soda or bleach, and an acid has a pH that is less than 7, such as lemon juice or battery acid.
A neutral substance has a pH of 7, such as drinking water.
For more on this topic, see the Science Buddies page on Acids, Bases, & the pH Scale.
These are the five different conditions you will investigate in this science project:   Water only: This condition will be your negative control because it will not have the food (i.e., sugar) that yeasts need to eat and grow.
The yeasts should remain inactive.
Sugar: This condition will be your positive control because it will have the sugar that yeasts need to eat and carry out fermentation.
Sugar and salt: The salt in this condition will increase the salinity (or amount of salt) that is in the yeasts' environment.
Sugar and baking soda: The baking soda in this condition will increase the environment's pH, making it more basic.
Sugar and vinegar: The vinegar in this condition will decrease the environment's pH, making it more acidic.How do you think increasing the salinity will affect the ability of yeasts to carry out fermentation?
What about making the environment more basic or more acidic?
To measure how well the yeasts carry out fermentation, you will use balloons to trap the CO2 gas released by the yeasts during fermentation.
To measure how much CO2 is in each balloon you will then submerge each under water and use water displacement to measure how much space each balloon takes up.
Which condition(s) will cause the formation of the most CO2 gas and the most active fermentation?
Measure how active yeast is in different conditions Another environmental condition that can affect the activity of yeast and the process of fermentation is temperature.
Prepare several bottles using the same conditions.
Now place each bottle in a different place with a different temperature.
After one hour, measure the amount of gas produced and compare.
In this experiment, you added the same amount of sugar to each bottle because it is what the yeast uses to make CO2 gas during fermentation.
If you add more sugar, will you always get more CO2 gas?
How much more sugar can you add?
Is there a limit?
You could try this science project again but instead of comparing salt, baking soda, and vinegar, you could try comparing different types of sugars or sugars from different sources, such as from various juices.

I learned a lot about yeast fermentation, fermentation in general, and microorganisms.
What problems did you encounter?
In one of my trials a balloon popped.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
I changed the experiment and instead tested the optimal amount of sugar.

that you have to wait a while for the yeast to work.
What problems did you encounter?
its hard sometimes to put the balloon on the bottle.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
i just wanted to know how this information might help in the future.
Thanks!

That yeast is a living organism.
What problems did you encounter?
That I couldn't figure out how to measure the gas.
So the project didn't work out for me.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
more step by step.

Yeast like sugar, and don't like vinegar.
What problems did you encounter?
Need more specific information on some of the steps.
For example, the balloons we got were small baloons, but did not fit the lip of the bottle, so a note suggesting that in the materials required section would be useful.
Also, in step 2, it should read add sugar to bottles 2-5 instead of 2-4.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
Possible additional conditions to test would be to start with different types of water (tap/filtered/bottled/river/sea etc.
), different types of sugar (white/brown/raw/powdered/glucose/corn syrup etc.)

I learned that yeast ferments the best with just the right conditions.
It needs sugar, doesn't like lots of salt, but does like acid.
What problems did you encounter?
Water balloons definitely don't work!
Party balloons worked great, but you might add a note about size of the balloons needed.
"Small" suggests water balloon size could work.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
See above.
