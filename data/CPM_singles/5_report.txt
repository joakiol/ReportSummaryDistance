 Yuck, What Happened to My Apple?
How Food Wrappings Affect Spoilage  Have you ever eaten half an apple and saved the other half for later, only to find that, by time you were ready to eat it, the apple did not look as tasty anymore?
It may have turned brown and shriveled, and, if left out long enough, it may have spoiled.
Do you think you could have prevented the other half from spoiling, or made it spoil less, if you had stored it differently, such as in the refrigerator in a food wrapping?
In this cooking and food science project, you will investigate which type of wrapping will keep sliced apples placed in the fridge the freshest and least spoiled.
Ever cut an apple into pieces and let some pieces sit out for a while?
After a few hours, you may have found that the apple was less appealing than when you first ate it.
The apple may have changed in appearance; it may have turned brown, shriveled up a little, felt and smelled different, and no longer been tasty.
Apples turn brown because of a chemical process called oxidation, which happens when oxygen interacts with another substance.
In the case of the apple, when it is cut, oxygen can interact with certain proteins, called enzymes, in the flesh of the apple.
These interactions cause many other interactions, which eventually lead to the forming of brown-colored chemicals.
These chemicals are what make the cut apple turn brown over time.
As a piece of apple turns brown, you may have noticed that it can also shrivel up a little, or desiccate.
Desiccation is the process by which something loses water and dries up.
The skin of the apple helps keep liquid inside of the apple, but when the apple is cut open, its skin can no longer protect it, and it slowly loses water.
Unless it is specially prepared, a desiccated piece of apple is not nearly as appealing as a plump, juicy piece of apple.
Watch this time-lapse video to see what happens to two apple halves when they are left out in a room for six days.

Spoiled food can look, feel, and smell unpleasant, and can make you very sick if you eat it.
Food becomes spoiled because microorganisms start living in the food.
These microorganisms can include different types of fungus, such as mold and yeast, and bacteria.
They can cause food to decay and develop unpleasant odors, tastes, and textures.
Sometimes food can even look perfectly good to eat, but can harbor pathogenic microorganisms that can cause illness and are hard to detect.
Examples of pathogenic microorganisms include Salmonella and some types of E. coli bacteria.
In this cooking and food science project, you will investigate which types of food wrapping keep sliced apples the freshest in the refrigerator: aluminum foil, wax paper, plastic wrap, or plastic sealable bags.
Throwing away food is a waste of money.
Save your family money by investigating how to keep your food fresh longer.
To investigate which type of food wrapping will keep sliced apples placed in the refrigerator the least spoiled and freshest.
Lemon juice, vitamin C, sugar syrup, and other substances are used to prevent apples from turning brown.
Do some background research to find out how these and other substances prevent apples from browning.
How effective are these substances at keeping apple slices fresh?
To find out, repeat this science project but compare different substances instead of different food wrappings.
Does temperature affect how fresh apple slices stay?
Do this science project again, but put unwrapped apple slices at different temperatures, such as in the freezer, the refrigerator, or at room temperature.
Does one temperature keep the apple slices fresher than the other temperatures?
Some types of apples brown easier than others.
Repeat this science project but instead of investigating different food wrappings, investigate how well apple slices from different types of apples stay fresh.
Which types of apples brown the least?
As you learned in the Introduction, if apple slices are exposed to oxygen, they can undergo oxidation and turn brown.
Think of some different ways you can prevent the apple slices from being exposed to oxygen.
Devise a way to test how effective the different ways are at preventing the apple slices from browning.
Microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungus, can cause food spoilage.
Do the freshest-looking apple slices in this science project actually have fewer microorganisms on their cut surfaces than the apple slices that look the least fresh?
You can investigate the microorganisms on an apple slice by taking a clean cotton swab, rubbing it along the cut surfaces of the apple slice, and then gently swiping the swab across the surface of an agar plate.
Seal the plates and leave them someplace warm for one to two days, until you see colonies of bacteria or fungus.
Did the wrapping that kept the apple slices the freshest also make apple slices with the least amount of microorganisms?
For science projects that grow microorganisms on agar plates  and related resources, see:        How Well Do Disinfectants Work?

Dried apples can make a tasty snack.
At the same time, they show how cut apples can become desiccated over time.
Find out how to make dried apple snacks, then weigh the apples before and after they have been dried.
How long did it take for the apples to dry?
How much weight did they lose?
Do all types of apples dry the same way?
