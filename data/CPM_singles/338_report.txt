 Do-It-Yourself DNA  All living things have DNA inside their cells.
How do scientists extract the DNA from cells in order to study it?
In this science experiment you can make your own DNA extraction kit from household chemicals and use it to extract DNA from strawberries.
All living things come with a set of instructions stored in their DNA, short for deoxyribonucleic acid.
Whether you are a human, rat, tomato, or bacteria, each cell will have DNA inside of it (with some very rare exceptions).
DNA is the blueprint for everything that happens inside the cell of an organism, and each cell has an entire copy of the same set of instructions.
The entire set of instructions is called the genome.Scientists study DNA for many reasons.
They can figure out how the instructions stored in DNA help your body to function properly.
They can use DNA to make new medicines.
They can genetically modify foods to be resistant to insects.
They can figure out the suspect of a crime.
They can even use ancient DNA to reconstruct evolutionary histories!How do scientists get the DNA out of a cell so that they can study it?
This is called a DNA extraction, and there are many DNA extraction kits available from biotechnology companies for scientists to use in the lab.
During a DNA extraction, a detergent will cause the cell to pop open, or lyse, so that the DNA is released into the liquid solution.
Salt can also be added to make the tiny strands of DNA clump together.
Then the DNA can be precipitated, or come out of the solution, by adding alcohol.
In this biochemistry science project you will make your own DNA extraction kit from household materials and use it to purify DNA from strawberries.
Figure 1.
Strawberries are octoploid, which means they have eight copies of the DNA in their genome in every cell!Why use strawberries to test your DNA extraction kit?
Because strawberry cells each have eight copies of the genome in every cell!
When an organism has eight copies, called an octoploid, it has a lot more DNA per cell than an organism that only has one copy.
Using DNA from strawberries will help you have a successful DNA preparation so you can purify a lot of DNA.
Design a DNA Extraction Kit and use it to purify DNA from strawberries.
You can try these steps to purify DNA from lots of other living things.
Grab some oatmeal or kiwis from the kitchen and try it again!
Which foods give you the most DNA?
If you have access to a milligram scale (called a balance), you can measure how much DNA you get (called a yield).
Just weigh your bamboo skewer using milligrams before and after the DNA purification.
Then subtract the starting weight from the final weight to get your final yield in milligrams (mg).
Compare your yield in milligrams (mg) under various experimental conditions:  Start with different amounts of strawberriesis more better?
Change some of the components of your kitwill other detergents work better?
Start with different materialsare there other sources of DNA with higher yields?

For my project the strawberry worked great, but I was extracting from a kiwi and an orange.
The orange did not work.
I was very disappointed.
I had extracted DNA from a strawberry at the citadel field trip I took in 4th grade, but this was disapointing.
The strawberry and kiwi were fine, but I wonder why the orange did not work?

Through this project I explored the field of genetics and the mechanics of DNA.
By completing this project I can better comprehend the basis of biology.
What problems did you encounter?
Extracted DNA was immersed in isopropyl alcohol.
However, the alcohol content was 75%.
Subsequently, the some of the DNA extract became partially dissolved.
This was due to the fact that the DNA backbone is made of sugar phosphate groups.
So, what occurred is that the water content affected the backbone causing the distortion.
Lesson here is that use isopropyl with a concentration of 90% or higher so there is less water interaction.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
Try this project with different DNA samples and see if adding an enzyme such as meat tenderizer or contact solution will yield more DNA.

I learned how to use common household supplies to extract DNA from strawberries.
I also learned that strawberries are octoploid, meaning they have eight copies of their genome in every cell, making it easier to get a high DNA yield in an extraction.
What problems did you encounter?
None- This project is perfect for elementary school kids- it's really easy to do and the results are very clear.
No issues with materials, safety, procedure, etc.
Spent under $20 and less than one day.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
Some explanation as to the role of each substance in the extraction solution would be helpful and add depth to the project.
The following should be added below step 6 (when the extraction solution is added to the strawberry mash) " The liquid detergent in the extraction solution causes the cell membrane to break down and dissolves the lipids and proteins of the cell by disrupting the bonds that hold the cell membrane together.
Salt enables nucleic acids to precipitate out of an alcohol solution because it shields the negative phosphate end of DNA, causing the DNA strands to come closer together and coalesce."
The following should be added to step 10: "DNA is not soluble in alcohol.
When alcohol is added to the mixture, all the components of the mixture, except for DNA, stay in solution while the DNA precipitates out into the alcohol layer- that's the goey clear/white stuff you can collect with a skewer or other thin rod"  (adapted from "Extracting Onion DNA") Overall, how would you rate the quality of this project?
