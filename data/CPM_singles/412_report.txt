 A Battery That Makes Cents  Batteries are expensive, but you can make one for exactly 24 cents!
In this experiment, you will make your own voltaic pile using pennies and nickels.
How many coins in the pile will make the most electricity?
You might think that batteries are a modern invention, but batteries were one of the first ways of making electricity.
Alessandro Volta discovered the first electric battery in 1800.
He made a giant stack of alternating layers of zinc, blotting paper soaked in salt water, and silver.
This early design for a battery became known as the voltaic pile.
Figure 1.
This image shows the structure of a voltaic pile, which is the first design of a battery that's used to make electricity.
It was discovered by Alessandro Volta in 1800.
(HowStuffWorks.com, 2007.
)How does a voltaic pile make electricity?
The key to electricity is the movement of particles carrying  electric charge.
In a voltaic pile, these particles move from one metal to the other through a solution called the electrolyte.
An electrolyte is a liquid that contains particles carrying charge.
Dissolved salt is an example of a good electrolyte.
The charged particles in the electrolyte react with the metals, causing an electrochemical reaction, a special kind of chemical reaction that makes electrons.
As electrons are particles that carry electric charge, making these electrons all move in the same direction will create a electric current or electricity.
You can read more about the basics of electricity in the Science Buddies Electricity, Magnetism, & Electromagnetism Tutorial.The two types of metals in a voltaic pile are called electrodes.
As the types of metal are different, one metal will like to give off free electrons, the other will be more eager to receive electrons.
This creates an electrical potential difference, also called voltage  between the two types of metals.
One metal becomes positively charged (the positive electrode) and the other becomes negatively charged (the negative electrode).
This voltage causes electrons to move, creating an electrical current, and then you have electricity!In this experiment, you will make your own version of the voltaic pile using two different types of coins (two different kinds of metal) and a salt-vinegar solution (the electrolyte).
The metal in the coins will react with the electrolyte.
As the two metals are different, one metal will like to give electrons to the other, creating electricity.
How will different numbers of coins affect the amount of electricity produced?
To test this, you will make piles with different numbers of coins and measuring the voltage (measured in Volt) and current (measured in Ampere) produced.
In this experiment, you will make a simple battery out of coins and test if the number of coins in the pile will affect the amount of electricity produced.
Try connecting an LED to your battery with copper wire or aluminum paper strips.
How many coins do you need to light the light?
You can test different LEDs to see if they need the same number of coins to light up.
(LEDs only pass current in one direction, so be sure you have it oriented correctly.)
Note on copper wire: Be sure the wire is NOenameled, or it will not work!
Enameled copper wire can be used if you first strip the insulation off.
This can be done with sandpaper, as explained in this    Wire Stripping Tutorial.
Compare different coin combinations to see which ones work and which ones don't:      Penny - Dime      Nickel - Dime     Nickel - Quarter    Penny - Quarter         Try other electrolyte solutions to see which ones work and which ones don't:     Plain water    Salt water    Lemon juice    Soda water         Try making batteries out of other things, like potatoes or fruits.

Different liquids / electrolytes made a difference in the battery voltage.
What problems did you encounter?
We had trouble with the nickels.
We also had better luck using cardboard squares instead of paper towels.
The cardboard seemed to stay wet longer.

The most important thing I learned was about battery's functions.
I never knew how "busy" a battery was until I found out!
What problems did you encounter?
Not really a lot of problems-except when I was measuring voltage and current.
The numbers kept on changing so eventually I had to average out the voltage and current.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
No...all of your ideas are just so-interesting!

The most important thing I learned is that there is a cheaper way to make a battery and I learned more about the history of the voltaic pile and the history of batteries.
What problems did you encounter?
The problems I encountered were not knowing what was the cathode and which one was the anode out of the coins(penny and nickel).
I was also unable to identify all of the controlled variable in the experiment.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
The improvement I have for this experiment is including which coin is the anode and which one was the cathode.
I also believe it would be helpful if you listed the control setup, and the variables of the experiment.

How a battery works to create electricity.
What problems did you encounter?
Using pennies and dimes (9) with the suggested multimeter, we got no reading at all.
We then sanded off the back side of the pennies to reveal the zinc (as suggested by another site) and we got readings.
However, the multi-meter recommended is not sensitive enough to indicate an increase in mA or mV with the increase of coins.It's a good project in general but you need to recommend a better reader.
I wasted $25.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
Instead of paper, use felt.
It absorbs more and won't disintegrate.

Keep trying even if at first you don't succeed.

could not get the voltaic pile to light the LED.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
we used tinfoil under our pile of coins to help with measuring the voltage and connecting the leads for the LED.
We also used coffee filters instead of paper towels.
That seemed to work better.
We had luck lighting the LED when we made these changes.

Well, it wasn't quite like this.
Since none of our group members had a digital multimeter, we just decided to skip that.
So we mixed vinegar and salt in a bowl, put the small squares of paper towel in the mixture and stacked the coins and you know.
Then, after 15~20 min, the coins changed and the squares turned blue!
We decided to make that our topic.
The most important thing I learned was that the coins DO change if they are put into vinegar and salt.
What problems did you encounter?
We didn't have a digital multimeter so we made a whole new topic about coins changing when they are put into vinegar and salt.
