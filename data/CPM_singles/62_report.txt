 Using Weather Balloon Data to Map Atmospheric Temperature  Snow-capped mountains make a picturesque scene, especially in summertime when the peaks are in such contrast to the warmth below.
This project shows you a way to see how temperature changes with altitude using data collected twice daily from weather balloons.
Twice a day all over the U.S., the National Weather Service launches weather balloons with instrumentation packages called radiosondes to collect data on the current conditions of the upper atmosphere.
As they ascend with the weather balloon, the radiosondes measure profiles of pressure, temperature, and relative humidity.
The radiosondes contain radio transmitters that send the collected data back to Earth.
The data are used for weather forecasting, and are available online.You can use this data for a science fair project on atmospheric conditions.
We will show you how to read temperature and pressure data from a standard upper air sounding plotthe same graphs that are used by meteorologists for weather forecasting.
This project shows you how to find out how the temperature changes with altitude in the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere, the troposphere.Figure 1 shows an example of an upper air sounding plot.
This is a standard graph used by meteorologists to analyze data from a balloon sounding.
There is a lot of additional information in the graph, but basically it is a plot of temperature (x-axis) vs. height (y-axis).
The white data line on the left shows the dewpoint vs. pressure, and the white data line on the right shows the temperature vs. pressure.
The pressure (in millibars, mb) is shown on the y-axis in blue lettering, and the height (in m) is shown in white lettering.
A sounding plot is also called a "Skew T" plot, because the temperature axis is plotted at an angle (i.e., skew) of 45.
The temperature lines of the Skew T are in blue (at 45).Figure 1.

Brrrrr!Atmospheric pressure decreases with height above the Earth's surface.
The higher you go, the less atmosphere remains above you, so the pressure decreases.
"Meteorology uses pressure as the vertical coordinate and not height.
This works out better for thermodynamic computations that are done on a regular basis.
Pressure decreases in the atmosphere exponentially as height increases reaching 0 pressure in space.
The standard unit of pressure is millibars (mb or hectopascals-hPa) of which sea level is around 1015 mb.
Here is a table of pressure levels and approximate heights (Unisys Corp., 2001):" PressureApproximate HeightApproximate Temperature (mb) (m) (ft) (C) (F)1015(sea level)001559100010030015598501500500054170030001000052350050001800020430090003000045492001200040000556710016000530005669Figure 2 shows how to read the temperature at a chosen pressure level (height).
On the y-axis, find the pressure level (in mb) where you want to know the temperature.
Follow the horizontal pressure line over until it intersects with the temperature plot (right-hand data plot, in white).
Then follow the 45 temperature line down and to the left to the temperature axis.
As shown in Figure 2, the temperature at 700 mb was about 11C.Figure 2.
Reading the temperature of the atmosphere at 700 mb (3022 m) from the sounding plot.
Follow the horizontal pressure line to where it intersects with the temperature plot (right hand data line, in white).
Then follow the 45 temperature line down and to the left to the temperature axis.
In this example, the temperature at 700 mb was about -11C.There is a lot more information in the sounding plot, but it isn't important for this project.
If you want to learn more about sounding plots, see the references in the Bibliography section (Unisys Corp., 1998, 2001; Millersville University LEAD Undergraduates, date unknown).In this project you will use balloon sounding data to investigate how atmospheric temperature and pressure change with altitude.
The goal of this project is to use weather balloon sounding data to investigate how air temperature and pressure vary with altitude.
Balloon soundings are taken at 12-hour intervals.
(Notice that the time given in the plots is coordinated universal time (UCT), not local time.)
Depending on the station location and time of year, you may be able to compare soundings taken during daylight hours to those taken after sundown.
Compare several sequential pairs of soundings (daylight/after sundown) for several locations.
Do you see any consistent relationships in the two temperature plots?
What do they tell you about the sun's contribution to heating different levels of the atmosphere?
