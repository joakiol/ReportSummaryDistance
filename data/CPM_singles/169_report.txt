 How Does Atmospheric Temperature Affect the Water Content of Snow?
Are you a snow aficionado?
What atmospheric conditions produce light, powdery snow, and what conditions produce heavy, wet snow?
This project shows you how to use data from daily balloon soundings of the atmosphere and your own snow measurements to find out.
If you're lucky enough to live in a place that gets snow in winter, you know that the feel of the snow can vary a lot.
Sometimes it can be light and fluffy, and other times heavy and wet.
The light, fluffy snow has less water content than the heavy snow.
What accounts for these differences?One possibility might be the temperature of atmosphere in the clouds where the snow forms.
Another possibility might be the temperature of the atmosphere through which the snow falls on its way to the ground.
You may be wondering, "How in the world am I going to measure the temperature of the clouds?"
Fortunately, you don't have to make the measurements yourself.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has already done it for you.
Twice a day all over the U.S., weather balloons are used to take atmospheric soundings.
The data from these soundings is available online (Unisys Corp., 2005).Figure 1 shows an example of an upper air sounding plot.
This is a standard graph used by meteorologists to analyze data from a balloon sounding.
There is a lot of additional information in the graph, but basically it is a plot of temperature (x-axis) vs. height (y-axis).
The white data line on the left shows the dewpoint vs. pressure, and the white data line on the right shows the temperature vs. pressure.
The pressure (in millibars, mb) is shown on the y-axis in blue lettering, and the height (in m) is shown in white lettering.
A sounding plot is also called a "Skew T" plot, because the temperature axis is plotted at an angle (i.e., skew) of 45.
The temperature lines of the Skew T are in blue (at 45).Figure 1.

Data shown are from International Falls, MN, March 23, 2007.Atmospheric pressure decreases with height above the Earth's surface.
The higher you go, the less atmosphere remains above you, so the pressure decreases.
"Meteorology uses pressure as the vertical coordinate and not height.
This works out better for thermodynamic computations that are done on a regular basis.
Pressure decreases in the atmosphere exponentially as height increases reaching 0 pressure in space.
The standard unit of pressure is millibars (mb or hectopascals-hPa) of which sea level is around 1015 mb.
Here is a table of pressure levels and approximate heights (Unisys Corp., 2001):" PressureApproximate HeightApproximate Temperature (mb) (m) (ft) (C) (F)1015(sea level)001559100010030015598501500500054170030001000052350050001800020430090003000045492001200040000556710016000530005669Figure 2 shows how to read the temperature at a chosen pressure level (height).
On the y-axis, find the pressure level (in mb) where you want to know the temperature.
Follow the horizontal pressure line over until it intersects with the temperature plot (right-hand data plot, in white).
Then follow the 45 temperature line down and to the left to the temperature axis.
In the example below, the temperature at 700 mb was about 11C.Figure 2.
Reading the temperature of the atmosphere at 700 mb (3022 m) from the sounding plot.
Follow the horizontal pressure line to where it intersects with the temperature plot (right hand data line, in white).
Then follow the 45 temperature line down and to the left to the temperature axis.
In this example, the temperature at 700 mb was about 11C.
There is a lot more information in the sounding plot, but it isn't important for this project.
If you want to learn more about sounding plots, see the references in the Bibliography section.In this project you will use atmospheric sounding data combined with your own measurements of the snow depth to liquid ratio to find out if there is a relationship between atmospheric temperature and snow quality.
The goal of this project is to investigate the effect of atmospheric temperature on snowfall depth.
