 M&M Survival Challenge  In the wild there are two types of animals: the hunters and the hunted.
A good predator is always on the prowl for fresh prey.
What can an animal do to stay off of the menu?
To survive, some animals use camouflage so they can better blend in with their surroundings.
In this science project, you will be the hungry predator hunting for M&M prey.
But it may not be as easy as it sounds  some of your prey will be camouflaged by their habitat.
Will they be able to avoid your grasp?
To find out, work up that appetite and go hunting!
Nature can be brutal.
The harsh reality is that if you are not a hunter, then you are being hunted, also known as the prey.
What do animals do to avoid being eaten?
Some animals develop defense mechanisms, like porcupine quills or the plated armor of an armadillo.
Other animals develop gross tastes on their bodies, or poisonous mucus coatings.This pattern of animals developing strategies to survive is called adaptation, and it is a mechanism for evolution.
You may have heard the famous phrase "survival of the fittest," which Charles Darwin used to describe this natural phenomenon.
In order to survive in nature, you need to be fit, and fitting in to your environment is very important to avoid being eaten!The most common way that animals can avoid being eaten by a predator is by an adaptation called camouflage.
Camouflage is a set of colorings or markings on an animal that help it to blend in with the surroundings and increase its chance for survival.
The surrounding environment that the animal hides in is called the habitat, or the place where the animal lives.
Each animal needs to adapt to a unique habitat, and animals adapt in all kinds of interesting ways using camouflage.
Katydids, like the one in Figure 1, are insects that usually live in green leafy trees and many have adapted to their habitat by having a bright green body shaped like a leaf.
Chameleons, which change habitats often in the colorful jungle, have adapted a way of changing their skin color to match their immediate environment.
Decorator crabs have adapted by learning how to cover their shells with debris to blend in with their habitat.Figure 1.
Can you see the katydid in this picture?
This katydid is using camouflage to look like a green leaf.
(Geoff Gallice, 2012)In this science project, you will test how adaptation and survival work by using M&M candies as your prey.
You will hunt for the M&M's in different-colored "habitats" to test whether some M&M's do better in some habitats than others.
Then you can discover which M&M's are best suited to survive in each habitat.
Hunt for M&M prey in a series of different habitats to discover which M&M's survive in each habitat and why.
In the wild, adaptation and evolution happen over several generations.
There is a way to test this phenomenon with the M&M science project.
Pick one colored Skittles habitat and randomly put the contents of an entire package of M&M's on it.
After a round of predation, as was described in the science project, double the number of M&M's that are left by adding a colored M&M to match the color of each M&M that is left.
For instance, if there are 4 red and 2 brown M&M's left, then add 4 more red and 2 more brown M&M's.
Then repeat another round of predation.
How many rounds does it take to get all the same colored M&M's?Do some research on how different animals use camouflage.
What types of things do animals try to look like?
Do some animals try to look like other animals?
Do some predators use camouflage too?
Think of a way to investigate how effective different types of camouflage are.
For example, you could have volunteers try to spot different camouflaged animals in pictures, like the katydid in Figure 1 in the Background, and time how long it takes for them to spot the animal.
Do some camouflage techniques work better than others?Different animals have adapted to different environments and habitats.
Take a trip to your local zoo and bring your lab notebook.
Write down and draw pictures of any special adaptations you observe.
Do animals in the zoo use camouflage?
Do the zookeepers do a good job of creating natural habitats?
How do you think that the adaptations of zoo animals work in the wild?
Do some kinds of animals have more adaptations than others?You could repeat this experiment but use different types of candy.
How easy is it for M&M's hunters to catch their prey when the habitat is made using candies of a different shape, such as Nerds candies, or candies that are both different in shape and multi-colored, like candy corn?
How effectively can the M&M's camouflage?

This was a neat project.
It really worked well with my kindergartener to teach about predators and prey.
What problems did you encounter?
The M&Ms were slightly different colors so some were easier to find than others.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
We modified for a younger child that she was the only predator and did not do multiple ones.
It would have bee too much data for a younger child.
That way it would work well for a younger student to do it as their own experiment.
She loved it and thought it was a lot of fun!

I learned to select my test groups carefully.
I also learned that when there's enough time, predators will even hunt the camouflaged prey.
What problems did you encounter?
Some test groups dumped the candy and reverse-sorted.
Some candy got crushed during transfer.
20 seconds was too long for my groups.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
Shorten the time to 15 seconds.

Objectives, introductions were clear.
What problems did you encounter?
Difficult for Kindergarden, more appropriate for 3rd-4th graders.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
Peanut M&Ms were rounder, more likely to roll off the table.
It was difficult to find M&M matching color papers without sampling the various paper products.
Also in step 7, need to make sure the M&Ms are spread evenly.
To add to difficulty, maybe choose a color that predators can't eat (poison).

if you have the same color of M&M and the paper, people tend not to pick the same colored M&M.
however,only the yellow and red paper worked in this case.
What problems did you encounter?
the color of M&M and paper are not matched closely.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
find a very close matched paper color with the M&M color.
Also, for the second round pick, one or two people will be enough.

only the yellow and red construction paper worked for having that color m&m survive.
What problems did you encounter?
the construction paper needs to be the same color as the m&ms.
I also did the variations where I needed to keep adding the remining m&m colors and by round three there were no survivors.
I never had just one color left.
Maybe add that there should only be one person picking the m&m and one timing.
We had 4 participants and by the 3rd round there were none left.

It is good to be camouflaged and M&Ms are good to eat.
What problems did you encounter?
We followed the chart, but the chart was incomplete, we used blue M&Ms once before we realized that we weren't supposed to be using them even though we used blue paper, the paper colors didn't match the M&M colors, we couldn't find any patterns in the data, and we both got headaches shortly after the experiment probably too much sugar too fast!
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
The idea was good behind the project and we had fun eating the M&Ms but we didn't really learn anything from the project.
It went against what we already knew about camouflage.
You need to make sure that you use the same color M&Ms as paper, but even then it doesn't prove much.
