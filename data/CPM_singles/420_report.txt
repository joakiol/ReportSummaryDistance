 Are Fingerprint Patterns Inherited?
Have you ever looked at two girls and thought they looked so similar that they must be sisters?
What about a father and his son  have you ever seen a boy who looked just like how his father did when he was younger?
We can often tell that two people are related because they appear to have several similar physical traits.
This is because children receive half of their DNA  their genetic blueprints  from each parent.
What about fingerprints  are they an inherited trait?
Fingerprints are used as reliable identification because each person's fingerprints are unique, but people can have similar fingerprint patterns.
In this science project, you will investigate whether fingerprint patterns are created randomly or whether they are influenced by genetics.
During weeks 10 through 24 of gestation (when a fetus is developing inside of its mother's womb, also called in utero), ridges form on the epidermis, which is the outermost layer of skin, on  the fingertips of the fetus.
The pattern that these ridges make is known as a fingerprint, and looks like the drawing shown in Figure 1, below.
Figure 1.
A drawing of a fingerprint.
Fingerprints are static and do not change with age, so an individual will have the same fingerprint from infancy to adulthood.
The pattern changes size, but not shape, as the person grows.
(To get a better idea of how that works, you can model the change in size by inking your fingerprint onto a balloon and then blowing up the balloon.)
Since each person has unique fingerprints that do not change over time, they can be used for identification.
For example, police use fingerprints to determine whether a particular individual has been at a crime scene.
Although the exact number, shape, and spacing of the ridges changes from person to person, fingerprints can be sorted into three general categories based on their pattern type: loop, arch, and whorl, as shown in Figure 2, below.
Figure 2.
The three basic fingerprint patterns are illustrated here.
(Image credits: FBI website)  The DNA that a person inherits from their parents determines many personal characteristics and traits, like whether someone is right- or left-handed or the color of their eyes.
In this science project, you will examine fingerprints from siblings versus pairs of unrelated individuals to figure out if general fingerprint patterns are genetic or random.
Have you ever looked at two girls and said, "you must be sisters"?
We can often tell that two people are siblings because they appear to have several similar physical traits.
This is because children receive half their DNA from each parent.
All biological siblings are the mixture of both parents' DNA.
This results in a greater degree of matching traits between siblings than between unrelated individuals.
Therefore, if DNA determines fingerprint patterns, then siblings are more likely to share the same fingerprint category than two unrelated individuals are.
Collect, categorize, and compare the fingerprints of siblings versus unrelated pairs of individuals to determine if fingerprint patterns are inherited.
How do your results change if you compare all 10 fingers, rather than just 1?
Do all 10 fingers from the same person have the same fingerprint?
Toes also have ridge patterns.
Do "toe prints" follow the same rules as fingerprints?
Are some patterns more common than others?If you make more quantitative measurements of the fingerprint patterns, can they be used to predict sibling pairs?
With what degree of accuracy?If fingerprints are unique, why do misidentifications occur in forensics?
How easy or hard is it to match a fingerprint with an individual?Read about statistics and use a mathematical test (like Fisher's exact test) to determine if your findings are statistically relevant.
To do this, you will need to make sure you understand p values and you will need to think about whether your sample size is large enough.
Online calculators, like the one from GraphPad Software, are good resources for this analysis.

fingerprints werent clear for example some people had scars or there had was unmoisturized.

Fingerprint patterns always fascinated meThe fact that every single individual on this earth has a unique fingerprint is totally astonishing!so....yeah....i did the project...completed it satisfactorily and got an A!the most important thing i learned was probably that all the families i experimented with....were willing to allow me and help me out whenever the situation demanded plus all were expecting a positive result :)...haha...well that did happen and i thanked them for their contribution.Most importantly.....i learned that families can have a set of similar fingerprint patterns.i am greatly thankful to sciencebuddies....who allowed me to access their data ....which guided me in the most precise way!Thanks much!

We were surprised with the outcome.
More times than not we had results that did not favor relatives matching What problems did you encounter?
Keeping data straight.
We were not as organized as we could have been.
Thinking about how we wanted to present the data would have altered our collection technique.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
Be very organized when it comes to the data collection portion.
Get as many samples as possible as it will keep the margin or error lower.

That even when your hypothesis is wrong you still learn a lot.
What problems did you encounter?
It was just difficult to make sure that we had everything in order for the releases and fingerprints.
It is a lot of data to get.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
Start gathering the fingerprints early.
Have a good spreadsheet in order to calculate the percentages and track everything.

my son learned to look at other resources before assuming that one site is the only one he needs.
He also learned that not everyone will be willing to have their fingerprints taken.
There were several who declined to participate and I just had to tell him to move on to the next person.
What problems did you encounter?
He was confused as far as the months for the fingerprints to occur.
He was not sure if it was between 3-4 months or just plain 3 months due to the other resources he looked up.
So I told him to make sure that he includes that when he was giving a brief history about fingerprint.
