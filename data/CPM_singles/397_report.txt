 Chemistry of Ice-Cream Making: Lowering the Freezing Point of Water  Have you ever made your own ice cream?
If you have, you probably know that you need to get the ice cream mixture really cold to freeze it quickly.
Ice cubes alone will not do the job, but if you add chemicals, such as salt or sugar, to the ice cubes that surround the ice cream container, the mixture gets cold enough to freeze.
Why does that work?
How does adding salt or sugar affect the freezing point of water?
Find out with this ice-cold science project and use your results to make your own delicious ice cream!
If you have ever made ice cream with an old-fashioned hand-crank machine, you probably packed a mixture of ice and rock salt around the container holding the cream.
The salt allows the ice-salt mixture to get colder than pure water ice.
This extra-cold ice-salt mixture freezes the cream in the ice cream machine.
If you live in a cold climate, you may also have seen trucks spreading salt or sand on the streets to prevent roads from getting icy after a snowfall.
This is because the salt lowers the temperature at which water freezes, so ice can melt even when the temperature is below the normal freezing point of water.
In both cases, salt is used to lower the temperature at which water freezes, a temperature called the freezing point.
The decrease in freezing point that happens when salt is  added to water is called freezing point depression.
Pure water freezes at 0 Celsius (C), but water mixed with salt freezes at less than 0 C.  Freezing point depression is not unique to water and salt; it happens with all solutions.
To make a solution, you dissolve a solute in a solvent.
The solvent does the dissolving, and the solute is the thing that is dissolved.
In this science project, you will use water as the solvent and sodium chloride (table salt) and sucrose (granulated sugar) as the solutes.
Adding a solute, like salt, to a solvent, like water, lowers the freezing point of the solvent.
But, by how much?
One degree?
Ten degrees?
The answer to that question depends on three things: the molality of the solution, the Van 't Hoff factor of the solute, and the molal freezing-point-depression constant of the solvent.
We will take a look at each of these factors.
Molality, m, is defined as moles (mol) solute per kilograms (kg) solvent, as shown in Equation 1:Equation 1:Molality(moles/kg)=Moles(mol)ofSolute/Kilograms(kg)ofSolvent Molality\; (moles/kg)\; =\; Moles\; (mol)\; of\; Solute/Kilograms\; (kg)\; of\; Solvent [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]  We care about molality because freezing point depression is a colligative property, a property that depends on how many solute particles are in the solvent, not the kind of solute particles.
Molality, m, is one piece of this "how many solute particles are present?"
question.
The Van 't Hoff factor is the second part of the "how many solute particles are present?"
question.
The Van 't Hoff factor, i, deals with how a molecule of solute dissociates, or breaks apart, in the solvent.
Covalent compounds, like sucrose  (C12H22O11), do not dissociate in a solution.
These compounds have Van 't Hoff factors i = 1.
Ionic compounds, like table salt (NaCl), dissociate when in a solution.
Table salt (NaCl) has a Van 't Hoff factor i = 2 because it dissociates into two ions in a solution, Na+ and Cl-.
The third factor, the molal freezing-point-depression constant, Kf, is different for every solvent.
It has units of (C/m), and it tells us how much  1 mol of solute added to 1 kg of solvent will lower the solvent's freezing point.
For pure water, Kf = 1.86C/m.
You can combine these three factorsmolality, m, Van 't Hoff factor, i, and molal freezing-point-depression constant, Kfinto an equation  that predicts how much the freezing point of a solvent will decrease, T, when a certain amount of solute is added.
Equation 2 is the freezing point  depression equation:Equation 2:  Degrees Freezing Point is Depressed (C) = Molal Freezing-Point-Depression Constant  (C/)     molality of solution (mol solute/kg solvent)     Van 't Hoff Factor (unitless) T=Kfmi \Delta T = K_f \times m \times i  [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]                    T is the freezing point depression in degrees Celsius (C).
Kf is the molal freezing point depression constant in degrees        Celsius per molal (C/m).
m is the molality of the solution in moles per kilogram (mol/kg).
i is the Van 't Hoff factor of the solute, which does not have units.
If you want to know the new freezing point of a solution, Tn, you subtract the change in temperature, T, from the original freezing point,  Tf, as shown in Equation 3, the solution freezing point equation:Equation 3:Solution Freezing Point (C) = Solvent Freezing Point (C) - Degrees Freezing Point is Depressed (C)Tn=TfT T_n = T_f - \Delta T  [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]                    Tn is the freezing point of the solution in degrees Celsius (C).
Tf  is the freezing point of the solvent in degrees Celsius (C).
T  is the freezing point depression in degrees Celsius (C).
In this science project, you will investigate how the freezing point of a solution changes depending on the concentration and kind of solute in the solution.
You will also compare the results  from your experiments with the results predicted by Equation 3, the new freezing point equation.
At the end, you can make your own delicious ice cream using the same principles that you applied in the project.
In this science project, you will investigate how dissolving chemicals in water changes the freezing point of a solution, and use your results to make delicious ice cream.
Try doing the experiment with calcium chloride (CaCl2) or magnesium chloride (MgCl2), seasonally available at hardware stores, often sold as ice melt.
How do the results from these chemicals compare with those from sucrose and NaCl?Try doing the experiment with both higher and lower concentrations of NaCl or sucrose.
Does the difference between the experimental and calculated values for freezing point depression change with the concentration of NaCl or sucrose?For some other chilly experiments, see the Science Buddies projects: Supercooling Water and Snap FreezingInvestigating the 'Mpemba Effect': Can Hot Water Freeze Faster than Cold Water?

The most important thing that I learned is that salt helps ice melt faster.
What problems did you encounter?
The problem that I encountered was the ice crystals not forming.
I do not know why but I really needed an answer to it.
Well, my school science fair is in two weeks and there is no time to redo my project.
But it was fun experimenting about this project.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
You should explain how long or when ice crystals will form.
On the procedures it did not specify how long.

I learned about Freezing Point Depression What problems did you encounter?
I had a hard time understanding the procedure Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
Maybe you should alter the procedure and make it more kid friendly, because I'm in 8th grade, and my teacher even thought the wording in the procedure was too advanced for this class.
I ended up doing it, but I had to go to a high school seince teacher for him to translate it into easier language for me to understand.
