 Bubble-ology  Making your own bubble solution is fun, but sometimes the bubbles don't seem to work as well as the solutions you buy in the store.
In this experiment you can test if adding corn syrup or glycerin to your bubble solution will make it just as good as the stuff you can buy.
This experiment will have you blowing bubbles!
Everybody loves bubbles!
But what makes bubbles form, and float up in the air until they pop?
soap bubble (Wikipedia Commons, 2006).The secret to a good bubble is something called surface tension, an invisible bond that holds water molecules together.
Water is a polar molecule, so it has plus and minus ends just like magnets that attract each other.
When the water molecules align with each other they stick together, creating surface tension.You might think that it is the surface tension of the water that holds the skin of a bubble together.
Actually, the surface tension of water is too strong to make a bubble.
You can try yourself to blow a bubble with plain old water, it just won't work!
A good bubble solution has a detergent added to it to relax the surface tension of the water, allowing it to have more elastic, stretchy properties.
Now it can act more like the skin of a balloon, stretching out nice and thin, trapping air inside of the bubble like a liquid balloon.
What do you need to make a good bubble solution at home?
The basic ingredients are water and detergent.
In this experiment, you will add glycerin or corn syrup to see if they can help you make better bubbles.
Which solution will make the biggest bubbles?
Which bubbles will last the longest?
In this experiment you will test if adding glycerin or corn syrup will improve a mixture of bubble solution.
In this experiment, you investigated the presence or absence of an additive like glycerin or corn syrup.
What about the concentration?
If you are good at timing bubbles, you can try this experiment using different concentrations of glycerin or corn syrup in your solutions.
How little is too little, and how much is too much to add?
Do bubbles always make a spherical shape?
Try twisting pipe cleaners into different shapes, like: stars, squares, and triangles.
What shape will the bubbles be?
What happens when three or more bubbles come together?
See if you can design an experiment to test the idea that three or more bubbles will always meet at a 120degree angle.
Have you ever tried Magic Bubbles?
They are bubbles that resist evaporation, and are so stable that you can even touch them without popping.
The secret to this formula is that a polymer (an elastic molecule) has been mixed into the solution which adds to the elastic properties of the bubble while helping to prevent evaporation.
Try adding your own secret ingredients to your bubble mix.
Does it change the physical properties of the bubble?
Here are a few suggestions:      A small amount of glue, like white glue or gel glue     Different combinations of food coloring    Some scented oils   Share your story with Science Buddies!I Did This Project!Please log in and let us know how things went.

This project made my students engaged and it was easy to develop a hypothesis, make the solution, and engage the students in every step of the process.
What problems did you encounter?
I could not find glycerin anywhere- my local CVS and Walgreens do not carry it.
I substituted vegetable oil and it worked very well.
The pipe cleaner wands also did not work very well.
I ended up using a wand from a different bubble solution because my students were getting frustrated with the pipe cleaner wands.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
The vegetable oil and wands, as aforementioned.

I learned that Glycerin in a bubble solution makes bubbles last longer than the corn syrup bubble solution bubbles.
What problems did you encounter?
None.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
Next someone can test if temperature of water can effect how long a bubble last.

I learned about various additives to "bubble solution" and how they affect the bubble produced.
This project is easy to execute and understand.
It is easy enough for young elementary students to execute with minimal parental assistance.
What problems did you encounter?
None- I found glycerin in a drug store as suggested by the PI and I had all of the other materials at home.
I completed this project in less than one day and spent less than $20 on materials.
No problems with safety, procedure, materials, introduction, etc.
The charts are helpful to organize the project.
