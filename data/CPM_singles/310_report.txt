 Build an Art Bot  Do you like drawing or painting?
What if you could build a robot that creates its own art?
In this project, you will create your own Art Bot, a robot with markers for "legs" that wobbles across a piece of paper, creating drawings as it moves.
You can then customize your robot to change how it draws.
This is a beginner-level project with no robotics experience necessary, so if you want to try building your own robot, this is a great place to start!
Do you like to draw pictures and make art?
Do you think it would be fun to build a robot that can draw with you?
In this project, you will build a robot called an Art Bot, like the one shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1.
An example of an Art Bot.The Art Bot uses a small electric motor to move.
In order to power the motor, the robot also needs a battery.
When you connect the battery to the motor, you complete an electrical circuit, and this allows the motor to spin.
The motor has an off-center weight attached to it (the popsicle stick in Figure 1), which causes the motor to vibrate.
When the motor vibrates, it causes the robot to wobble across the paper.
This is the same technology that makes video game controllers and cell phones vibrate; on the inside, they have little spinning motors with weights attached.
Your Art Bot will also have markers for "legs," so it will draw on paper as it moves.
In this science project, you will find out how the weight attached to the motor affects the robot's movement.
What happens if the popsicle stick is perfectly centered?
What happens when it is way off-center?
Move on to the Materials section to see the list of supplies you will need to build your own Art Bot, and the Procedure for instructions on how to build one and do the experiment.
Build an Art Bot and investigate how changing the robot's design affects how it draws.
The Art Bot you built in this project is a tripod, meaning it has three legs.
What happens if you build an Art Bot that is a quadruped (has four legs) or a hexapod (has six legs)?Can you design an Art Bot that uses something other than a plastic cup for the robot's body?
For example, can you build a body out of popsicle sticks?Can you design an Art Bot that goes straight, instead of wobbling around randomly?If you are ready for a more-advanced robotics project, check out  Build a Light-Tracking Bristlebot.

how to make an electrical circuit.
What problems did you encounter?
The double sided tape did not hold the motor in place and the cork would not stay on the motor I had to use duct tape and lots of it to stabilize the motor and keep it from wobbling off the top of the cup.
I had to glue the cork onto the motor to keep it from spinning off.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
The art procedure needs to include better instructions on securing the needed pieces of your motor and cork in place.

Matching the right materials together to stablize the Art Bot, made out of basic home products.
The 9V powered motor was a challenge to keep the parts connected.
Our prototype connected by tape only fell apart and was quite uncontrollable.
This second built Art Bot, connected with Art hot glue gun and a sturdier cup met the challenge.
What problems did you encounter?
Using light weight materials -vs- The 9V Motorized Battery.
This little Art Bot wanted to draw all over the place.
The popsicle stick's rpm was amazing.
In our attempts to get our 4 legged Art Bot to draw with tape connections only, caused us to go back to the drawing board to figure out a stronger adhesive.
We chose to build our 2nd Art Bot with Hot Glue Connections.
Only the wires are connected with electrical tape.
The battery casing is connected to the body(cup) via Hot Glue.
Yes we faced connectivity problems, and we solved them with a stronger adhesive which did withstand the rpm spinning of the popsicle stick.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
We build our Art Bot with 4 legs(markers).
The stability reminds me of the balance 4 wheeled vehicles gives us in our environment.
The larger the circumference the body(cup) of the Art Bot, the more legs(markers), can be added.
With a drawing program intergrated into this project, I believe the Art Bot could be used to draw people.
The 4-Blue Eyes on our Art Bot are cameras, we imagine.
See picture attached.
I would like to send a close up of the Art Bot, but only 1 picture is allowed to send with this project results report.
The Art Bot is a wonderful intro project for students who love Art and have an interest in Robotic Science.
Giving this project more usage in society, such as drawing real life drawings in places where humans with cameras are not allowed, ie USA Court Rooms, will, I believe, be very prosperous for USA Citizens Families.
AUTODESK is on to something too.
Thanks Science Buddies!!!
ARis Important 2, just as MUSIC.
STEM must not exclude Art & Music.

Awesome kit.
We made 2 art bots, one with 3 marker legs and one with 4.
Made charts for both.
So fun.
Thanks again for a great project.

That if you use three popsicle sticks in a form of a propeller, then the spirals and the dots will be closer together.
What problems did you encounter?
The Art Bot kept falling over, but then I fixed it.

Yes, you should add that if you put the popsicle sticks in the form of a propeller, then it works better.

That it takes energy to make the robot make art.
What problems did you encounter?
If the legs were not taped in the right shape, it fell over, and if too many legs were used the robot could not move.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
The cost was minimal, and except for the motor, we were able to use household items to make the robot in just a couple of hours, not days, and very cheaply.

I learnt that using more markers changes the pattern it draws and the artwork also changes size.
It moves using two forces: the centripetal force and the centrifugal force.
When three sticks or one stick is/are attached off centre , the centrifugal force is greater than the centripetal force which causes it to vibrate.
then, let it draw on a big sheet of paper for a while, and be struck by its drawing ability!!
What problems did you encounter?
There was a single problem though , it can't run as nicely on a rough surface as on a smooth one.
:} Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
Yes, this artbot may be made into MOPbot by removing its markers and attaching some mops... mothers would be pleased!!
