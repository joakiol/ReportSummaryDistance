ecosystems: - ls2.a: interdependent relationships in ecosystems	ecosystems: - ls2.a: interdependent relationships in ecosystems Ecosystems have carrying capacities , which are limits to the numbers of organisms and populations they can support .
These limits result from such factors as the availability of living and nonliving resources and from such challenges such as predation , competition , and disease .
Organisms would have the capacity to produce populations of great size were it not for the fact that environments and resources are finite .
This fundamental tension affects the abundance ( number of individuals ) of species in any given ecosystem .
