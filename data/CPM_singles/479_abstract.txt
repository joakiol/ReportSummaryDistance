waves and their applications in technologies for information transfer - ps4.b:  electromagnetic radiation	waves and their applications in technologies for information transfer - ps4.b: electromagnetic radiation Some materials allow light to pass through them , others allow only some light through and others block all the light and create a dark shadow on any surface beyond them , where the light can not reach .
Mirrors can be used to redirect a light beam .
( Boundary : The idea that light travels from place to place is developed through experiences with light sources , mirrors , and shadows , but no attempt is made to discuss the speed of light . )
