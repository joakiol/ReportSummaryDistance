 Warped Words and the Stroop Effect  The Stroop effect describes an experiment about the time it takes to name the color of printed words.
When you try to name the color in which color words are printed, it takes longer when the color word differs from the ink color than when the color word is the same as the ink color.
This project is an interesting variation: what happens if you 'warp' the words into a curved shape that is harder to recognize as a word?
Will the Stroop effect still happen?
How 'warped' do the words have to be in order to negate the Stroop effect?
The Stroop effect describes an experiment about the time it takes to name the color of printed words.
When you try to name the color in which color words are printed, it takes longer when the color word differs from the ink color than when the color word is the same as the ink color.To give you an idea of how the Stroop effect works, here is a task for you to try:   Following this list of instructions are two gray boxes that each contain a list of words.
The words appear in color on your screen.
The task is to name the color of the letters of each word (not to read the words).
Try to the name each color as quickly as possible.
red  green  blue  yellow  black  white  yellow  blue  black  green  white  red            white  black  yellow  green  blue  red  black  yellow  white  blue  green  red      Naming the colors was much harder for the second box, right?
You may even have felt like you were fighting back an urge to read the color word out loud, rather than naming the color of the letters.
This phenomenon was described in 1935 in a now-famous paper by John Ridley Stroop, and is known in experimental psychology as the Stroop effect.
One explanation for the Stroop effect is called interference.
From the earliest years of school, reading is a task that people practice every day.
We become so good at it that we read words automatically.
When we are asked to name the color of the word instead of reading the word, somehow the automatic reading of the word interferes with naming the color of the word.This experiment explores what you can do to change the presentation of the word in order to eliminate the Stroop effect.
For example, if you print the words in the shape of a circle, does it make reading the word slow enough so that the interference effect is reduced or canceled?
Does it make a difference if the letters are in clockwise order or counterclockwise order?
Figure 1 below has examples to show what we mean, and the Experimental Procedure section has a pdf file that you can download and print (requires Adobe Acrobat).Figure 1.
Examples of the five different 'warped' words test stimuli.
The first line has clockwise words that match the ink color.
The second line has clockwise words with non-matching ink color.
The third line has counterclockwise words with matching ink color.
The fourth line has counterclockwise words with non-matching ink color.Will warping the words into a circle prevent automatic reading and the interference effect that goes with it?
Does it matter if the letters are arranged in clockwise vs. counterclockwise order?
Try this experiment to find out!
The goal of this project is to determine if manipulations of words (e.g., rotation, mirror reversal, bending into circles), can eliminate the Stroop effect.
For a basic project on the Stroop Effect, see the Science Buddies project What Conflicting Mental Tasks Reveal About Thinking: The Stroop Effect.
Does interference still occur if the test words are turned upside down or rotated 90?
Design an experiment to find out.
For an alternative experiment that investigates whether the Stroop effect occurs with shapes, see the Science Buddies project Shaping Your Thoughts?
Advanced.
Does practice make any difference with this experiment?
For example, you may find little interference when reading the 'warped' words, and you might expect the interference to increase with practice as people become more accustomed to reading them.
On the other hand, you might expect interference to decrease with practice as people become more accustomed to calling out the ink color.
Design an experiment to find out what happens with practice.
For a super-advanced project, can you figure out different practice routines to push the result one way or the other?

Your mind can almost do what it wants to do, which is not always what you want it to do.
What problems did you encounter?
For my analysis section of my science fair project, my teacher said it was not throe enough.
However, he said it was because the test was so simple.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
Maybe you could somehow make the test a little more challenging for the mind.

Well, I learned a lot about the Stroop effect, but I would say the most important thing I learned was when you are testing your participants, do not give them ANY information on your project like what you are testing and stuff.
Then they get nervous and the results are not consistent!
What problems did you encounter?
The only problem I had was finding enough people.
The rest was awesome!
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
Please just explain about not telling people all the details of the project.

you should be really patient, especially when you do an experiment similar to this one, and pick a lot of words to test.
What problems did you encounter?

I learned that there IS is an actual reason for texts to be black instead of being colored.
What it we came across a color name?
If the text was colored, it would be confusing... What problems did you encounter?
The participant didn't know they were supposed to read the words as fast as they could, so they kept a slow and steady pace.
I had to explain the instructions again.
Can you suggest any improvements or ideas?
I think the strip of words (the number of words) should be less.
I think it tired the participants.
