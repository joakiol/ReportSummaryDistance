 That's a Real Smile!
...or is it?
If someone is smiling, it means they're happy, right?
Well, not always.
Sometimes people smile to be polite, or because they want to "appear" happy or friendly for social reasons.
How easy is it to spot which smiles are genuine and which are fake?
Try this science fair project to find out!
How many times a day do you smile?
Out of those, how many times do you really mean it?
Try keeping trackyou might be surprised!
People do smile when they're genuinely happy, but the truth is, humans also smile for a lot of other reasonsmost of them are social.
For example, maybe you've just been introduced to your best friend's cousin, Mark.
What do you do?
Smile and say hello!
But are you really happy to meet him?
Probably not; instead you're smiling to be polite and welcoming.
On the other hand, if someone introduced you to your favorite movie starwell then you'd be grinning out of sheer delight!
How easy is it to spot a genuine smileone that happens spontaneously because the person is feeling happyfrom one that is made on purpose, for social reasons?
Do you think you're good at telling the difference between genuine (real) and fake smiles?
Before reading any further, try this 10-minute online Spot the Fake Smile test to find out just how talented you are at discerning between genuine and fake smiles.
Remember to write down your answers so that you can calculate your score.
So, how did you do?
Are you surprised?Biologists and psychologists have spent many research hours working to understand how and when different facial expressions are made, and how others interpret those expressions.
By observing people who've had strokes or other brain injuries, scientists have learned that there are two parts of the brain that control smiling.
The motor cortex controls voluntary motions of the face (that is, motions done consciously and on purpose).
When a person wants to smile for social reasons, he or she uses the motor cortex of their brain to do so.
But spontaneous, emotionally driven smiles are triggered by a totally different part of the brain: the cingulate cortex.
So, as long as the cingulate cortex wasn't damaged, a person who has had a stroke that affects his or her motor cortex can still grin at a good joke if he or she truly finds it funny.
Although the smiles initiated by the brain's motor cortex do a good job of mimicking the emotional smiles initiated by the cingulate cortex, research shows that there are differences between the two types of smiles.
The first person to define some of the differences was the nineteenth-century French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne.
His work showed that a genuine smile not only stimulated an upward movement of the mouth muscle (the zygomatic major muscle), but also caused a movement in the muscle around the eyes (the orbicularis oculi).
The activation of the orbicularis oculi muscle resulted in wrinkling around the eyes (sometimes called crow's feet) and an upward pulling of the cheeks.
In contrast, non-emotional or "fake" smiles result in movement of the zygomatic major, but not the orbicularis oculi.
In honor of his observations, genuine smiles are often referred to as Duchenne smiles.
Figure 1.
The photo on the left depicts a Duchenne smile.
Note the uplifted cheeks and wrinkling around the eyes.
The non-Duchenne smile, shown on the right, has neither of these features (photo courtesy of Amy and Aneshka Drahota, 2008.
)Researchers in the twentieth century have also noted that in addition to the stimulation of different muscles.
Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiles differ in other ways.
During Duchenne smiles, the face is generally symmetricalas opposed to say a smirk, where only one side of the mouth lifts.
Duchenne smiles are also smoother in appearance; whereas non-Duchenne smiles often start or end abruptly.
And lastly, genuine smiles usually last between 0.5 and 4 seconds; non-Duchenne smiles are often either more fleeting or longer lasting, depending on the social trigger.
So clearly there are physical differences between genuine and fake smiles, but are people innately aware of them?
How accurate is the average person at differentiating between a Duchenne and a non-Duchenne smile?
You can find out in this science fair project by seeing how your friends and family perform on the Spot the Fake Smile test!
Discover whether people can accurately determine if a smile is genuine or fake.
Does outlook on life (pessimism versus optimism) have an effect on people's ability to detect non-Duchenne smiles?
How about age or gender?
Or personality traits like extroversion versus introversion?
Design experiments to find out.Does knowing about Duchenne versus non-Duchenne smiles change people's ability to detect genuine versus fake smiles?
Try modifying the experimental procedure above to find out.
Hint: You'll need to teach one group of people about Duchenne smiles, but not the other.
Both test groups should consist of at least 40 volunteers each, to increase the confidence in your results.Can people "hear" a genuine smile in someone's voice?
You'll need to devise a way of having people say the same sentence repeatedly while sometimes having a Duchenne smile and sometimes not.
One method might be to video tape people reciting a funny poem with a refrain.
Use the video tape to catalog when they have a Duchenne smile on their faces and when they don't.
Then play audio clips associated with Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiles (or no smile at all) for other volunteerscan they distinguish, by voice alone, when someone is genuinely smiling?

The most important thing I learned is that people do try to look for signs that are associated in fake smiles.
This indicates that people have some knowledge of spotting a fake smile.
What problems did you encounter?
A problem I encountered was convincing my science teacher that this was an experiment, not a how-to.

I didn't know that when people smile is is either to be polite or happy or friendly when they wanted to appear!!!
:)  What problems did you encounter?
I had to find kids to test and that kinda didn't help me when I had to have 15 students that wanted to be tested but other than that I think that it was a good project!!!

I think that you should make this a little bit harder.

I learned that some people that had very low confidence are better than you would think.
Believing that you can do it is important.
i will try to remember in the future not to underestimate a person just because of what they thought about themself.
From people who I have found not to be the sharpest knife in the drawer I got some good results.
you don't have to be book smart to be able to tell the difference between a real and fake smile.
Or anyhting else social.

It is better to show how to do the test, rather than just tell them, because otherwise they don't watch the movies.
