 Launch Time: The Physics of Catapult Projectile Motion  In physics class, you have probably rolled your eyes at some point after being assigned a "projectile motion" homework problem where you use equations to predict how a ball will move through the air.
This experiment will show you just how fun that problem can be by using a real catapult to launch a ball and videotaping it as it flies along its path.
Then, you will analyze the video and compare it to what the equations predicted.
If you have ever wondered if those equations in your physics textbook are actually worth the paper they're printed on, this is your chance to find out.
You have probably seen figures in your physics textbook that show a catapult launching a projectile and then equations that calculate the resulting trajectory.
Well, it is a lot more fun if you actually get to use a catapult instead of just doing the calculations!
In this science  project, you will use a catapult to launch ping-pong balls and use a video camera to film their trajectory, or path, as they fly through the air.
You can also use physics to predict the trajectory of the ball, and then compare this predicted trajectory to the one you measure from video recordings.
If the results match, you can conclude that your predictions and the assumptions you used to make them were valid under the circumstances of the test.
If they don't match exactly, that's OK.
There are many real-world factors that can be difficult to account for in predictions.
Part of the scientific process involves figuring out what those factors are so you can make better predictions next time.Predicting the trajectory of a ball launched from the catapult requires an understanding of two fundamental physics concepts: projectile motion and conservation of energy.
Projectile Motion Projectile motion refers to the method used for calculating the trajectory of a projectile (which can be pretty much any physical object  a rock, a ball, etc.)
as it moves through the air.
Technical Note:You may hear "projectile motion" used interchangeably with the word kinematics, depending on the textbook, website, or teacher.
Kinematics (the study of motion) broadly includes things like pulleys, linkages, and gears.
For this project, we are only concerned with projectiles.
Understanding projectile motion requires an understanding of position (the location of the ball, or projectile), velocity (how fast the ball is moving), and acceleration (how fast the velocity changes).
A more advanced understanding of projectile motion involves calculus and factors like air resistance.
For this project we will use simplified constant acceleration equations.
These equations rely on the assumption that we can ignore air resistance  otherwise, the acceleration would change over time, and not be constant.
(Note: Hover over the equations in this Introduction with your cursor to view enlarged formulas.
)The four equations are:Equation 1:  df=di+vit+12at2 d_f = d_i + v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]Equation 2:  vf=vi+at v_f = v_i + at [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]Equation 3:v2f=v2i+2a(dfdi) v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 a \left(d_f - d_i \right) [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]Equation 4:df=di+12(vf+vi)t d_f = d_i +  \frac{1}{2}\left(v_f + v_i\right) t [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]In these equations, the subscripts i and f stand for initial and final, respectively.
The variables d, v, and a stand for distance, usually expressed in meters (m); velocity, usually expressed in meters per second (m/s); and acceleration, usually expressed in meters per second squared (m/s).
The variable t stands for elapsed time, usually expressed in seconds (s).
Given certain information about an object at one time, these equations let you calculate what is happening at another time.
For example, if you are running at an initial velocity of 3 m/s and accelerating at a rate of 1 m/s, you can use Equation 2 to calculate that your final velocity will be 5 m/s after a time (t = 2) seconds passed by:vf=3ms+1ms22s=5ms v_f = 3\frac{m}{s} + 1\frac{m}{s^2}\cdot 2s = 5\frac{m}{s} [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]However, these equations are only for one dimension, and the catapult-launched ball in this experiment is going to be moving in two dimensions  x and y. Fortunately, we can take the same set of equations and apply them to the x and y directions independently  motion in the "y" direction does not affect motion on the "x" direction, and vice versa.
Figure 1 shows a diagram of the setup for this experiment.
Figure 1.
This graphic shows a typical setup for a projectile motion problem.
A projectile at height h above the ground (y=0) is launched with an initial velocity v0 at an angle  with respect to the horizontal (the x-axis).
Gravity (g) is in the negative y direction.
We want to calculate the position of the ball at any time, t. Thus we need equations for both x and y as functions of t. We will call these x(t) and y(t).
Let us start with a new Equation 5 (using Equation 1), renaming the variables to be consistent with the x direction:Equation 5:x(t)=x0+vx,0t+12axt2 x(t) = x_0 + v_{x,0}t+\frac{1}{2}a_x t^2 [Please enable JavaScript to view equation] Two things here can immediately make this equation easier to work with: we can assume that the initial x position is just zero, so x0=0.
We also know that there is no acceleration in the x direction, because we are ignoring air resistance, and gravity certainly does not act sideways, so ax=0.
Now, Equation 5 reduces to:Equation 6: x(t)=vx,0t x(t) = v_{x,0}t [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]But we were only giving the initial velocity of the ball, v0 , not the initial velocity in the x-direction, vx,0 .
However, we know the launch angle, .
So, we can use trigonometry to calculate the initial x velocity:Equation 7: vx,0=v0cos()  v_{x,0} = v_0 \cos(\theta)  [Please enable JavaScript to view equation] Plug that into Equation 6, and we have our final equation for x as a function of time:Equation 8: x(t)=v0cos()t x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) t [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]That is only half of the problem, though.
We need to do the same thing for the y direction.
Let us take Equation 1 again, this time substituting the appropriate y variables: Equation 9: y(t)=y0+vy,0t+12ayt2 y(t) = y_0 + v_{y,0}t + \frac{1}{2}a_y t^2 [Please enable JavaScript to view equation] In this case, we cannot make any variables zero.
We know from Figure 1 that the ball is launched from an initial height of h and that we have a downward (and therefore negative) acceleration of gravity, g. We can also calculate the initial velocity in the y direction, similar to what we did for the x direction in Equation 8, but this time using sine instead of cosine.
Equation 9 thus becomes:Equation 10: y(t)=h+v0sin()t12gt2 y(t) = h + v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2}g t^2 [Please enable JavaScript to view equation] Now we can use Equations 8 and 10 to plot the motion of a projectile in the (x,y) plane.
Conservation of Energy We are not finished yet, however  using Equations 8 and 10 requires that we know a few things  the height of the catapult above the ground, the angle at which the ball is launched, and its initial velocity.
It is easy to measure the catapult's height with a tape measure, and the catapult in this kit makes it easy to measure the launch angle (more on that later).
But what about the initial velocity of the ball?
We cannot measure that directly, so we will use conservation of energy to estimate what it would be.
In our case, we are dealing with kinetic energy (the energy an object with mass has according to its velocity) and potential energy (the energy that is stored in the rubber bands of the catapult).
Note: We are ignoring a small amount of gravitational potential energy for now.All types of energy are usually expressed in units of joules (or J).
Conservation of energy states that, assuming losses like friction in a system are negligible, the sum of kinetic energy (or KE) and potential energy (or PE) always stays the same.
This can be expressed in an equation:Equation 11: KEi+PEi=KEf+PEf KE_i + PE_i  = KE_f + PE_f [Please enable JavaScript to view equation] For this project, we will need to know the kinetic energy of a point mass (the ball or projectile can be approximated by a mass concentrated in a point), expressed as follows:Equation 12:KE=12mv2 KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]and the kinetic energy of a rotating object:Equation 13:  KE=12I2 KE = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2 [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]where m is the mass of an object (usually expressed in kilograms [kg]) and v its velocity; I the mass moment of inertia about the center of rotation (usually expressed in kilograms*meters squared [kg*m]) and  the angular velocity (expressed in radians per second [rad/s]).
We also need to determine the potential energy stored in a spring.
Normally, for a linear spring, this would be expressed as: Equation 14: PE=12k(x)2 PE = \frac{1}{2}k\left(\Delta x\right)^2 [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]where k is the spring constant (usually expressed in newtons per meter, [N/m]) and x is the displacement from the spring's rest position (do not confuse this with the distance x in Figure 1they are different things).
However, the rubber bands that come with the catapult kit do not behave this way  they act as nonlinear springs.
The equation for their potential energy as a function of displacement x is:Equation 15: PE=23kx32 PE = \frac{2}{3}k \Delta x^{\frac{3}{2}} [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]This equation is specific to the rubber bands in this catapult kit and will not necessarily be true for every nonlinear spring.
You can look in the Bibliography or any high-school physics textbook for more information on these topics.
We have also included a Science Buddies reference page, Linear & Nonlinear Springs Tutorial  if you would like to understand where Equations 14 and 15 come from.
Applying These Principles to the Catapult  The catapult kit is pictured in Figure 2, with all of its parts labeled.
This catapult has two key features: an adjustable pin lets you set the launch angle (the angle in which the ball travels relative to horizontal at launch, shown in Figure 1) and tick marks let you measure the pull-back angle (how far back the arm is pulled before launch).
Also, Figure 3 shows a zoomed-in view of how to measure these angles and Figure 4 labels them for clarity.
The catapult kit also comes with two different balls (ping-pong and Wiffle) and enables you to adjust the number of rubber bands.
See the Bibliography for more information about the catapult kit.

The rubber-band-powered catapult is clamped to a table (we have used a paper towel to prevent it from scratching the surface).
An aluminum disk with tick marks lets you measure the launch-angle and pull-back angle easily.
Figure 3.
Tick marks enable you to read the launch angle and the pull-back angle on the catapult.
In this picture, the launch angle is 30 degrees and the pull-back angle is 60 degrees.
Figure 4.
Illustration of the launch angle and pull-back angle on the catapult.
Remember that our goal is to calculate the initial velocity of the ball, so we can then use the projectile motion equations to predict its path.
To do this, we will compare the total energy of the catapult system in two different positions: when the arm is pulled back all the way, and immediately before the ball leaves the cup.
These two positions are shown in Figure 5 with the following variables labeled:L is the length of the launch arm;r is the radius to the center of the ball (this is slightly smaller than L);x is the total length of the rubber band (it is folded in half for use on the catapult, so Figure 5 only shows  x); andv is the velocity of the ball.Using Equations 11 through 14, we can write out the energy balance for these two positions.
Three things can have energy in our system: The ball can have kinetic energy (remember that we are ignoring gravity for now, since the elevation change is very small);The arm of the catapult can have kinetic energy; and The rubber bands can have potential energy.
The ball and the arm initially have zero velocity  and thus no kinetic energy.
When you pull the arm back, potential energy is stored in the rubber bands.
When you release the arm, the rubber bands contract, and their potential energy is converted to kinetic energy for the arm and the ball.
The sum of these energies always has to be the same, which enables you to calculate the velocity of the ball.
We will not go through the full derivation here  but advanced students may want to work this through and include it as part of their project.
The energy balance, where N is the number of rubber bands, k is the spring constant of a single rubber band, x0 is the unstretched length of a rubber band, m the mass of the ball, and I is the moment of inertia of the arm, is:Equation 16:  23Nk(x1x0)32=23Nk(x2x0)32+12(m+Ir2)v22 \frac{2}{3}Nk \left( x_1 - x_0 \right) ^\frac{3}{2} = \frac{2}{3}Nk \left( x_2 - x_0 \right) ^\frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\left( m+ \frac{I}{r^2} \right) v_2^2 [Please enable JavaScript to view equation] You will have to do some algebra to rearrange Equation 16 to solve for our unknown variable  the launch velocity of the ball, v2.
Also note that this equation makes use of the relationship between the linear velocity of the ball, v, and the angular velocity of the arm, :Equation 17: v=r v = r \omega [Please enable JavaScript to view equation]  Now that you know the launch velocity, you can go back to Equations 8 and 10, and you have everything you need to calculate the x and y positions of the ball at any time, t. This will give you your theoretical results or predicted trajectory  that is, what should happen according to equations you wrote down on paper.
You will compare these to your experimental results  what actually happens when you launch the ball and measure its trajectory with recorded video.
A challenge for advanced students: The length of the rubber band, x, can just be measured with a ruler, but this could get annoying after a while.
Can you use trigonometry to find a relationship between the length of the rubber band and the pull-back angle (which can be read directly from the disk on the catapult)?
Figure 5.
The catapult when it is pulled back all the way (left), and immediately before the ball is launched (right).
V is the velocity of the ball, x the total length of the rubber band, L the length of the launch arm, and r the radius to the center of the ball.
L and r both remain constant, so we did not label them both  in each half of the figure in order to avoid clutter; L goes all the way to the end of the launch arm while r's distance stops half way through the ball.Important: remember that the rubber band is folded in half when inserted into the catapult   thus, the side view shows only half of its total length.
Use projectile motion equations to predict the path of a ball launched through the air, then compare that path to the actual trajectory filmed during experiments.
The theoretical predictions outlined in this project ignore gravitational potential energy during launch and air resistance during the ball's flight.
Can you re-derive the energy and projectile motion equations to include these terms?
If so, do the theoretical results match up better with your experiments?Are your results different if you use the Wiffle ball instead of the ping pong ball?
