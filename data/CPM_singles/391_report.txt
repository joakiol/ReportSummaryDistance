 Dry Spells, Wet Spells: How Common Are They?
Can you remember what the weather was like last week?
Last year?
Here's a project that looks at what the weather was like for over a hundred years.
You'll use historical climate data to look at moisture conditions in regions across the continental U.S.  You'll use a spreadsheet program to calculate the frequency of different moisture conditions for each region and make graphs for comparison.
Which part of the country has the most frequent droughts?
The most frequent periods of prolonged rain?
The most consistent precipitation?
Here's one way to find out.
In this project you will analyze historical climate data (from 1895 to the present) for different regions in the continental United States.
You will learn how to use a spreadsheet to calculate the relative frequencies of wet, normal and dry conditions for each region.
You will also learn how to make histograms  of your data in order to compare the different regions of the country.The National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) has several different types of historical climate data covering the period from 1895 to the present.
There are monthly records on temperature and precipitation, plus calculated indices that show the severity of a wet or dry spell.
There will be detailed instructions in the Experimental Procedure section on how to download the data and import it into the spreadsheet program.
First, though, you need some background information on what is in the data files.
There is a lot of information in the data files, but if you take your time reading through the descriptions and then browsing through the data files, you will be able to make sense of it.
Making a print-out of the project will help, too (use the "Printable version" button at the top of the page).The data you will be using for this project is called the Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI).
This is a monthly value (index) that indicates the severity of a wet or dry spell.
It is based on the principles of balancing supply and demand for moisture, and is used to assess the long-term moisture supply (description from the "drought.README" file on the NCDC ftp site).The PHDI generally ranges from +6 to6, with occasional values in the range of +7 and 7.
Negative values denote dry spells; positive values denote wet spells.
Table 1 shows the ranges of the index and corresponding categories of wetness or dryness.
Table 1.
Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI) Categories       PHDI Range   Category       From (low)   To (high)         4.00   >4.00   Extreme Wetness       3.00   3.99   Severe Wetness       1.50   2.99   Mild/Moderate Wetness       1.49   1.49   Near Normal       2.99   1.50   Mild/Moderate Drought       3.99   3.00   Severe Drought       <4.00   4.00   Extreme Drought   For this project, you will be downloading a data file that contains state, regional, and national monthly average values for PHDI.
The following table shows you how the columns of data are organized within the file.
Table 2.

There are nine separate regions, each consisting of two or more states.
The drought index for each region is the weighted average of the drought index for each state within the region.
The weights are set according to area of the state relative to the area of the region.
The following table shows the states that make up each of the nine regions.
The table also gives the code for each region (used as an identifier in the data file), and the relative weight for each state used to calculate the weighted average.Table 3.

There are many interesting hypotheses that you can investigate with similar methods.
By including data from additional sources (e.g., sea surface temperature, other climatological data, or Landsat imagery) you can further expand the range of hypotheses.
The Variations section has some ideas to get you started, and you can come up with your own as well.
The goal of this project is to compare long-term precipitation patterns in different regions of the country.
You will work with historical climate data, and you will use a spreadsheet program to make histograms and analyze the data.
This is just one way of looking at the data.
Think of other ways that you might graph the same data to answer different questions.
What season has the most frequent droughts?
The most frequent wet weather?
Is it the same season in every region of the country?
If you are interested in extending this project to other types of historical climate data, Table4 describes the other data files available from the NCDC ftp site.
The top half of the table lists the State/Regional/National data files (like the one described for this project).
There is information available on temperature, precipitation and four different drought indices.
The "Data Code" column shows the one-digit code that appears in column5 of the data file (see Table2).
The bottom half of the table lists the State Division data files.
These contain the same type of information as the regional State/Regional/National files, but at higher spatial resolution.
Each state is divided into geographic divisions, and the climate data is reported for each of these divisions.
If you are interested in these files, you can find information on the layout of the state divisions here: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/onlineprod/drought/statelist.html.

How do these data compare across different regions of the country?
If you are interested in examining climate at a finer spatial scale, the NCDC ftp site also has data by geographic regions within individual states (see Table4).
What were the frequencies of different climatic conditions in your area over the last hundred-plus years?
For a more advanced project, you could look for correlations in climate patterns between different regions of the country.
You could also look for correlations between regional climate patterns and larger-scale phenomena such as El Nio and La Nia.
For information on how to do correlation calculations with spreadsheet data, see the Science Buddies project: Which Team Batting Statistic Predicts Run Production Best?.
The Bibliography lists additional sources of historical climate data.
How far back in time can you extend this type of analysis?
What types of climate data are available for the pre-historic era?
