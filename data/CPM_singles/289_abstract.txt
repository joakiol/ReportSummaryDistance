energy - ps3.b:  conservation of energy and energytransfer	energy - ps3.b: conservation of energy and energytransfer Energy can also be transferred from place to place by electric currents , which can then be used locally to produce motion , sound , heat , or light .
The currents may have been produced to begin with by transforming the energy of motion into electrical energy .
