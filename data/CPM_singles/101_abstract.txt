ecosystems: interactions, energy, and dynamics - ls2.a:  interdependent relationships in   ecosystems	ecosystems: interactions, energy, and dynamics - ls2.a: interdependent relationships in ecosystems The food of almost any kind of animal can be traced back to plants .
Organisms are related in food webs in which some animals eat plants for food and other animals eat the animals that eat plants .
Some organisms , such as fungi and bacteria , break down dead organisms ( both plants or plants parts and animals ) and therefore operate as “decomposers.” Decomposition eventually restores ( recycles ) some materials back to the soil .
Organisms can survive only in environments in which their particular needs are met .
A healthy ecosystem is one in which multiple species of different types are each able to meet their needs in a relatively stable web of life .
Newly introduced species can damage the balance of an ecosystem .
