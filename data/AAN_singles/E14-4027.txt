Ezafe isan unstressed vowel that is usually not written,but is intelligently recognized and pronouncedby human.
Ezafe marker can be placed intonoun phrases, adjective phrases and someprepositional phrases linking the head andmodifiers.
Ezafe recognition in Persian isindeed a homograph disambiguation problem,which is a useful task for some languageapplications in Persian like TTS.
In this paper,Part of Speech tags augmented by Ezafemarker (POSE) have been used to train aprobabilistic model for Ezafe recognition.
Inorder to build this model, a ten million wordtagged corpus was used for training thesystem.
For building the probabilistic model,three different approaches were used;Maximum Entropy POSE tagger, ConditionalRandom Fields (CRF) POSE tagger and also astatistical machine translation approach basedon parallel corpus.
It is shown that comparingto previous works, the use of CRF POSEtagger can achieve outstanding results.1 IntroductionIn Persian language, Ezafe is an unstressedshort vowel /-e/ (or /-ye/ after vowels) which isused to link two words in some contexts.Although Ezafe is an important part of thePersian phonology and morphology, it does nothave a specific character representation, and so isnot usually written.
However, it is pronounced asa short vowel /e/.
Sometimes, for disambiguationpurposes it is preferred to explicitly mark itspresence by a written symbol (the diacritic Kasre)after some words in order to facilitate the correctpronunciation.The most important application of Ezaferecognition is a text to phoneme tool for Text ToSpeech (TTS) Systems.
Other application ofEzafe recognition is identifying the dependencyof a word in a Noun Phrase.
(Oskouipour, 2011,Mavvaji and Eslami, 2012)In this research, we would like to investigatevarious approaches to correctly recognizegenitive cases in Persian language.
Shortly, thecontributions of this paper are as follow:?
Modeling the Ezafe recognition task as asequence labeling system.?
Using HMM and CRF as sequence labelers.?
Modeling the Ezafe recognition task as amonotone translation problem which can betackled by phrase based SMT approach.?
Using a big amount of test and gold data, sothe results are considerably reliable.?
To enhance the results of the system, fivePersian-specific features which discriminatethe results in high-precision low-recall fashion,have been proposed.?
The recognition rate has achieved outstandingresults in comparison to the previous works.This task is closely related to the task ofdetermining short vowels in Arabic language.
So,although the aim of this paper is to recognizeEzafe in Persian language, but all the methodsinvestigated here is applicable to determine shortvowels in Arabic language.In the next section a clear definition of theproblem is presented and the characteristics ofPersian language are introduced.
In Section 3 wewill give a precise definition of Ezafe.
Section 4provides an overview of previous works onEzafe recognition.
Our approach will bedescribed in Section 5 followed by two sectionsincluding corpus selection process andimplementation of proposed method.
Conclusionand recommendations for future works will bepresented in the last section.1382 An Overview of Persian LanguagePersian Language belongs to Arabic script-based languages.
This category of languagesincludes Kurdish, Urdu, Arabic, Pashtu andPersian.
They all have common scripting, andsomehow similar writing system.In Arabic script-based languages, the mostcommon features are absence of capitalization,right to left direction, lack of clear wordboundaries, complex word structure, encodingissues in computer environment, and a highdegree of ambiguity due to non-representation ofshort vowels in writing (Farghaly, 2004).
Notethat Ezafe recognition and homographdisambiguation problem mostly deals with thelast mentioned feature.One of the problems in Persian languageprocessing is long-distance dependencies.
Thisphenomenon complicates Ezafe recognition taskeven for humans (Ghomeshi, 1996).
Anotherproblem is how to determine phrase/wordboundaries.
In Persian language, affixes can bewritten in three formats; completely separated bya space delimiter, separated by half-space1 , orcan be attached to its main word.
So, determiningword and phrase boundaries are somehow acomplicated task in Persian.The third challengearises by pronoun drop due to the morphology ofPersian language.3 Ezafe DefinitionHistorically, Persian Ezafe had ademonstrative morpheme in old Iran (Estaji andJahangiri, 2006).
It was related to a demonstrative/hya/, which links the head noun to adjectivalmodifiers, to the possessor NP (Samvelian, P.,2007).
In evolution of Persian language, /hya/became /?i/ in Middle Persian and progressivelylost its demonstrative value to end as a simplelinker.
In recognizing Ezafe, we should considerall morphological, syntactic, semantic anddiscourse views (Parsafar, 2010).
It should benoted that Ezafe can be iterated within the NP,occurring as many times as there are modifiers.4 Previous WorksAs a first attempt to recognize Ezafe in Persiantext, Bijankhan (Bijankhan, 2005) used a patternmatching algorithm for Ezafe recognition.
Hehas used POS tags and also semantic labels (suchas place, time, ordinal numbers ...) to obtain a1A Non-Joint Zero Width (NJZW) letterstatistical view of Ezafe markers.
He manuallyderived 80 most frequent patterns such as Noun-Noun and Noun-Adjective etc.
The mostfrequent combinations were extracted based on a10 million-wordscorpus.In a research accomplished by (Isapour, et al.,2007), the researchers rely on the fact that Ezafecan relate between head and its modifiers so as tohelp to build NPs.
So by parsing sentences andfinding Phrase borders, the location of Ezafe inthe sentence can be found.
In this work, thesentences were analyzed using a ProbabilisticContext Free Grammar (PCFG) to derive phraseborders.
Then based on the extracted parse tree,the head and modifiers in each phrase can bedetermined.
In the last phase, a rule basedapproach was also applied to increase theaccuracy in Ezafe marker labeling.
For trainingthe algorithm, 1000 sentences were selected anda parse tree was built for each of them.
Becauseof the limited number of parsed sentences fortraining, the results cannot be extended forgeneral applications.There were also other attempts to effectivelyrecognize Ezafe marker in Persian text, such as(Zahedi, 1998) based on fuzzy sets.
Also,(Oskouipour, 2011) developed a system based onHidden Markove Model to correctly identifyEzafe markers.
(Mavvaji and Eslami, 2012) hadanother attempt by syntactic analysis.
There arealso some implementations using neuralnetworks (Razi and Eshqi, 2012).
Some of theresults can be seen in Table 4.5 Our ApproachIn this paper we have investigated two typesof POS taggers, and also a MT-based approach.In the following section, these approaches will beexplained and the results will be compared toprevious work.A.
Ezafe recognition as a POS tagging problemPart Of Speech tagging is an effective way forautomatically assigning grammatical tags towords in a text.
In Persian, POS tagging can beapplied as a homograph disambiguation problemfor correct pronunciation of words in a sentence(Yarowsky, 1996).
There are powerful POStagger algorithms such as statistical, rule based,transformation based and memory based learningmethods.
In this research we have used twoschemes of statistical POS tagging for Ezaferecognition.
The first one is a Maximum Entropytagger that has been investigated by (Toutanovaand Manning.
2000) and (Toutanova, et al.1392003).
In order to implement this approach, wehave used Stanford toolkit as a MaxEnt tagger.The second approach is based on ConditionalRandom Fields (CRF) model, that was firstintroduced by (Lafferty, et al., 2001) and then(Sha and Pereira.
2003).B.
Ezafe recognition as a translation problemWe can consider the Ezafe recognitionproblem as a monotone translation problem.
Inother words, it can be considered as a noisychannel problem.
The original training textwithout the Ezafe marker can be used as sourcelanguage, and the tagged text can be used asdestination language.
So, we can apply theseparallel corpora as inputs to a phrase-basedStatistical Machine Translation (SMT) system.In the experiments, we have used monotoneSMT with distortion limit equal to zero.
Forimplementing SMT, we have used Moses toolkit.It should be mentioned that in the case of Ezaferecognition, we can use a SMT system withoutre-ordering.
By using phrase-based SMT, thelocal dependencies between the neighboringwords are handled by the phrase table.
Also someof the dependencies between different phrasescan be tackled by the language model.6 Data PreparationIn this work, we have used Bijankhan corpus(Bijankhan, 2004, Amiri, et al, 2007).
Thecontent of this corpus is gathered from daily newsand common texts, covering 4300 differentsubjects.
It contains about 10 million taggedwords in about 370000 sentences.
The words inthe corpus have been tagged by 550 tags based ona hierarchical order, with more fine-grained POStags like ?noun-plural-subj?.
About 23% of wordsin the corpus are tagged with Ezafe.
We haveused an extended version of POS tags, namedPOSE (Part of Speech tags + Ezafe tag) that canbe constructed by adding Ezafe markers tooriginal first level tags.
Table 1 shows thestatistics of POSE tags.POSE Frequency %  in Ezafemarkers%  inall corpusN-e 1817472 81.87 18.39ADJ-e 223003 10.05 2.26P-e 111127 5.01 1.125NUM-e 27860 1.26 0.28others 40477 1.81 0.41Total 2219939 100 % 22.46Table 1 - Ezafe Statistics in Bijankhan Corpus7 Performance MetricsThe ordinary measures that can be used basedon confusion matrix are Precision, Recall and F1measure.
Another measure that can be used inthis binary classification problem is MathewsCorrelation Coefficient (MCC).
This measureindicates the quality of the classifier for binaryclass problems especially when two classes are ofvery different sizes.We have also considered twoother measures; true positive rate as Ezafepresence accuracy, and false positive rate asEzafe absence accuracy.
The total average can becalculated using a weighted average of the twolast mentioned measures.8 Experiments and ResultsAs mentioned, the system was trained onBijankhan corpus.
Only the first level of POStags was used for the training phase, except forthe words with Ezafe, that the POS plus Ezafemarker was chosen.
The more fine-grained POStags were removed to achieve more accuracy.We used a ten-fold cross-validation scheme.For calculating the total accuracy, Ezafe presenceaccuracy and Ezafe absence accuracy should beweighted by 16.8% (ratio of words with Ezafemarker in test corpus) and 83.2% (ratio of wordswithout Ezafe marker) respectively.A.
Evaluating fine-grained tagsThe first experiment was done in order to testthe ability of other fine grained POS tags in Ezaferecognition.
In this test that was done on 30% ofthe corpus, all of the fine grained POS tags of thewords plus Ezafe marker were used to train aMaximum Entropy POSE tagger.
As shown inTable 2, the accuracy of the system decreasedwhen we used complete features hierarchy.
So, inconsequent experiments, we used only first leveltag features.ConditionsPerformance measures(Run on 30% of corpus)Precision Recall F-measureMCC AccuracyMaxEnt+POSE 87.95 93.14 0.91 0.89 96.71MaxEnt+POSE+ finegrained tags89.56 88.69 0.89 0.87 96.37Table 2: Experiment Based on Full Tag HierarchyB.
Evaluating MaxEnt taggerIn the next experiment, we used a MaxEnttagger applied on whole corpus.
With first levelhierarchy of POSE tags, a total accuracy of97.21% was resulted.
As shown in the Table 3,while we have a good recall rate, the precision140reached a fair value.
Both F-measure and MCChave values greater than 0.9.The effect of eliminating titles which areincomplete sentences was also experimented.Table 3 shows that eliminating theachieve a good improvement in accuracyC.
Using Persian-specific featuresAugmenting the system with some Persianspecific features to decrease FP and FN cansignificantly increase the total accuracy.
Asshown in Table 3, by using fiveaccuracy can be increased by more than 0.6%.The features are as follow:?
Punctuations cannot take Ezafe.
Bfeature, these FP errors will be removed?
Noun words which are followed by adjectivesand adverbs should take Ezafe marker.?
Adjectives which are followed by nouns andadverbs should take Ezafe marker.?
Adverbs which are followed by nouns andadverbs should take Ezafe marker.?
Nouns, adverbs and adjectives which arefollowed by verbs do not take Ezafe.ConditionsPerformance measuresPrecision Recall F-measureMAXent+POSE 89.44 94.48 0.919MAXent+POSEwithout title 89.53 94.47 0.919Maxent+POSE+Persian SpecificFeatures91.37 95.92 0.936Table 3 - Results of Experiments on complete corpus SizeNote that the false positive rate of the abovementioned experiment is about twicenegative rate.
So, we tried to extract morefeatures based on investigating words in FP tableand confusion matrix.D.

Experimental results showthat CRF tagger acts pretty well in Persian Ezaferecognition.
The obtainedoutstanding performance comparapproaches and the accuracy is quite reliablebecause of training based on a 10 millioncorpus.Future research can be done based onother taggers such as log-linear and TnT taggers.Moreover, Ezafe recognition can be viewed as aspell checking problem.So, a spell checker canalso be used as another approach.withaugmented byresultsErrorTotalAccuracy16.80 70.064.38 93.297.05 89.864.68 91.6910.01 88.862.25 97.211.82 97.801.63 97.831.63 98.04results showing to earlier-words141ReferencesAmiri, Hadi, Hojjat, Hossein, and Oroumchian,Farhad.,2007.Investigation on a Feasible Corpusfor Persian POS Tagging.
