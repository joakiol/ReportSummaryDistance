Lexical Rules: What  are they?Andrew Bredenkamp, Stella Markantonatou and Louisa SadlerDepartment of Language and LinguisticsUniversity of Essex, UK{andrewb,m~trks,louisa}~essex.~c.ukAbstractHorizontal redundancy is inherent o lex-ica consisting of descriptions of fnllyformed objects.
This causes an unwel-come expansion of the lexical databaseand increases parsing time.
To eliminateit, direct relations between descriptionsof fnlly formed objects are often defined.These are additional to the (Typed Mul-tiple) Inheritance Network which alreadystructures the lexicon.
Many implement-ations of horizontal relations, however,fail to generate l xieal entries on a needs-driven basis, so eliminate neither theproblem of lexicon expansion or that ofinefficient parsing.
Alternatively, we pro-pose that lexical entries are descriptionsof objects open to contextnal specifica-tion of their properties on the basis ofconstraints defined within the type sys-tem.
This guarantees that only thosegrammatical lexical entries are inferedthat are needed for efficient parsing.
Theproposal is extremely modest, makinguse of only basic inference power and ex-pressivity.1 Lex ica l  Ru les :  what  are they?Within the strongly lexical framework of HPSG,lexi('al ru les  are used to express relations amongdescriptions ..... a kind of indirect "horizontal re-latedness" (Pollard & Sag 1987, 209) which can becontrasted with the vertical relations between thetype(s) of lexical elements.
Type relations are, ofcourse, captured irectly as the monotonic (typed)multiple inheritance network itself, which struc-tures the lexicon.Typical examples of horizontal redundancy inthe hierarchical lexicon thus conceived arc the Al-ternation phenomena (e.g.
Dative Shift, the Locat-ive Alternation, ctc) and word formation phenom-ena (inflectional and derivational morphology).
Infact, Pollard and Sag also refer to declension classmembership and similar facts as horizontM rela-tions, and as we shall see, the boundary betweenvertical and horizontal relations is not immutablyfixed once and for all.The notion of lexical rule is often given somestatus at the level of linguistic or psychologicaltheory.
(Pollard & Sag 1987) make reference toa generative or procedural interpretation of lexicMrules as a deductive mechanism which can be de-ployed on a needs only basis, for example, to gen-erate words from a single base form.
The concep-tion of lexical rules as essential generative devices(rather than static statements expressing (sub-)regularities), is shared in much in:llnential work(e.g.
(Bresnan 1982), (Pinker 1989)), althoughit is by no means universM, even within tIPSG.Viewed from an implcmentational perspective, on-the-fly application of lexicM rules brings with it anumber of distinct advantages which follow fromthe drastic reduction in the size of the lexicM data-base (lexical construction is less time consmningand parsing time should be reduced as lexical ookup is less ambiguous, etc).
At first sight then it ap-pears that the benefit of adding an external Lexicall(ule component outweighs the disadvantages (ex-ternal powerNl mechanisms).
We will first showthat their role is less clear than this suggests andcertainly more problematic, before suggesting inSection 2 an alternative which eschews any extramechanisms.1.1 Horizontal and Vertical RedundancyThe parallel drawn above between vertical related-ness (expressed with the type system) and ho-rizontM relatedness among descriptions of fullyformed objects is however rather misleading.Monotonic multiple inheritance networks are mostnaturally used to represent generalisations overthe properties that (groups of) linguistic objects163share - inspection of any network will eonfirinthat they are usually deployed to express whatis essentially a componential analysis of objectsand of the relationship between them (defined onthe basis of this analysis).
On the other hand,horizontal relations among descriptions (very of-ten lnodelled by means of lexical rules) are es-sentially relations holding directly between objectsthemselves.
While this intuition is clear, this ismuch less adequate an approach for morpholo-gical relatedness, where a componential pproachmay often appear just as natural as an object re-latedness view, especially if the formalism includesfimctionally dependent values, permitting the ex-pression of allomorphic wtriation and the like.
Infact, many putatively horizontal relations may besimply re-expressed within a type hierarchy byviewing them Dom a compouential perspective,obviating the need for expressing them on the %o-rizontal" dimension which may lead 6o the use oflexical rules.
13ut this is only possible once onefrees oneself rom a view of lexical relatedness assomething which holds essentially between words(objects which correspond to maximal types, thatis types at the bottom of the type hierarchy).llorizontal relations are perhaps most naturallycaptm:ed by an extra device (Ll{s) external to thelexical network and associated inference mechan-ism-- see (Krieger gc Nerbonne 1993) and (Cal-cagno 1995) for recent ItPSG proposals.
Some re-cent work ((Mem'ers 1995) and (l{iehemann 1994:))partly departs fl:orn this view by expressing rela-tions between objects using the vertical axis (thatis, using the type system), but again tile startingpoint is 'complete' lexical objects.1.2 Why avoid Hor i zonta l  RelationsYHorizontal relations have a number of undesirablefeatures as well as requiring an external meclmn-ism.
HorizontM relations (between objects) arein principle pretty much unconstrained.
Verticalrelations are more constrained becmlse they arebased on componential nalysis, starting out Dorathe set of properties that objects have.
On theother hand, any object can be related to any otherobject by stipulation in an external mechanism.
Inarchitectural terms, it is simply accidental (if for-tuitous) that lexical rules are often used to relateminimMly different objects - -  they are capable ofmuch more promiscious behaviour.This state of,affairs is amply demonstrated inthe literature, which abounds with attempts toconstrain horizontal relations by appeal to subsi-diary principles (predicate locality in LFG, con-straints of a psycholinguistic nature in the work of(Pinker 1989), etc).
Horizontal relations must beconstrained to account for 'exceptional' behaviour,that is, for those words which do not participateto a given horizontal relation despite the fact thattheir description makes them appropriate candid-ares for the relation (verb alternations offer severalexamples of these situtation, for instance, 'giving'verbs which do not exhibit the so-called 'dativeshift' phenomenon).Modelling of'exceptional' behaviour leads eitherto an extreme complexity of the type system orto non-lnonotonic solutions (Flickinger 1987) b(>cause it turns out that certain horizontM relations,usually defined over types, nmst be blocked for in-dividuM objects.1.3 hnp lement ing  Hor i zonta l  Re lat ionsSeveral different implementations of horizontal re-lations exist.
All of them add extra machineryand some add extra expressive power to the coremechanism.Most frequently, horizontM relations are imple-mented as unary rules operating at parsing timewithin a dcrivationM component.
Such a compon-ent is t ided to the inheritance machinery fbr in-dependent reasons, mainly because of' the limitedexpressivity of the type systeul.
With Ll/.s, somelexical entry is considered as 'basic' and all otherlexical entries are derived fl:om it introducing oth-erwise unjustified directionality to the grammar.In addition, the derivational implementation f ho-rizontal relations fails to produce lexical entries a.sneeded, instead, it produces lexica.l entries accord-ing to the system's internM algorithm of searchingthe rule space.
Considerable ambiguity is intro-duced with unpleasant results for parsing time.Extra machinery for blocking these rules in or-der to account for exceptional behaviour is alsonecessary.Alternatively, Lt{s may be compiled out bat,nnder this approach too, problems like direction-ality and the blocking of Ll{s as well as expensiveambiguity at parsing time remain unsolved.2 An  a l te rnat ive  proposa lIn this paper we explore an alternative to hori-zontal relatedness which exploits the idea that it isoften possible to conceive of the linguistic objectsin such a way as to eliminate potential sourcesof ambiguity and additional external mechanisms.To illustrate our approach we will propose an ac-count of a subset of Verb Alternation phenom-ena which rely on what are essentially underspe-cilled lexicM entries.
The lexicon will then con-tain one (verbal) entry and the system will relyonly on the existing resources (the type hierarchy)164to provide the different interpretations of the pre-dicate which license the distinct eoml)lementationpatterns.
Analysis is incremental and determin-istic and the procedure relies mainly on what wewill call 'trivial type inference'.
In the sectionsthat follow \[irst we discuss the linguistic at)l)roaehunderlying our proposal, second we eOmlmre ourproposal to existing underspecification tq)proachesand finally, we give some details of the implementa-tion which relies on no special fc'+~tures or externaldevices.2.1 -Underspeei f icat lonWe will exemplify ore- approach by treating asubset of verb alternati(ms which conform tothe following general schema (\]).
These includethe so-called spray/load (locative) Mtornation, thewipe~clear a.lternation, the b~vak/hit alternationetc (l,evin 19!)a).

Secondly, identifying the semanticsof verbs with ttmt of prepositions does not allowfor expressing certain types of diverse behaviourwithin the class of a.lternating verbs.
For instauce,both load and stuff show locative, alternation, butonly the former admits optional PP complements.With to stuff the interpretation under which lees-lion is a direct object admits an optional P I ) eotn-plement (8) while the interpretation under u, hichIocatum is a direct argument admits an obligat-ory one (9).
Similarly, while both versions of toload are related to passive adjectives (loaded carl,loaded hay), only the "location" version is related165cont~tct optional obligatory Oll-GO~on_con.opt on_con-obl with-con_opt with_con~blFigure 1: Type system fragment encoding prepos-itional alternationto such an adjective in the case of to stuff (stuffedpillow, *stuffed feathers).
The exact treatment ofsuch phenomena, however, goes beyond the scopeof our discussion here which concentrates on theuse of underspecification.
(8) Mary stuffed the pillow with feathers.
(9) Mary stuffed the feathers into the pillow.Optionality of PP complements can also be cap-tured easily with this proposal.
With to load (2),(3) and (4), the PP complement is optional.
Thegrammar must have access to three different ver-sions of to load, one with zero PP complements andtwo with a PP complement participating in the al-ternation discussed above.
One approach wouldinvolve defining two lexieal rules; an alternativewould be to express all three possibilities directly.Both are problematic, of course.
Consider the situ-ation when the grammar has two PS rules for VPs,one for discharging a \[NP,NP\] SUBCAT list and onefor discharging a \[NP,NP, PP\] list.
Without harm-ing generality, assume that the bivalent version ofto load is in the lexicon and two lexical rules gen-erate the trivalent versions.
To process a trivalentversion, the parser will backtrack on the bivalentversion, will use a lexical rule and then, it willeither succeed or it will backtrack again and use asecond lexical rule.To avoid this, the following solution may be ad-opted.
First, the type system is augmented to al-low for declaring the property of being an optionalor an obligatory prepositional complement, as infigure 1.Second, a PS structure rule is introduced of thefollowing sort:VP --+ V\[SUBCAT\[NP,NP,P(optional)P\]\], NPOnly one trivalent, underspecified version of toload is necessary.
The parsing of a trivalent ver-sion as before would involve backtracking on therule dealing with optional complements but thenthe rule dealing with obligatory ones would bechosen and it would succeed anyway.Only limited inference power is necessary forthis set up to work: the system must be able toinfer that the unification of a subtype with its su-pertype is of the type of the subtype.
This 'trivialinference power' is independently needed to deal,for instance, with (10): if NP1 is a subtype of NPthen rule (10) will work only if trivial inferencepower is available when the sequence NP1, VP isencountered.
(10) S --+ NP, VPThere are proposals in the literature whichbuild on the idea of using underspecified entries.However, several of them use additional, externalpowerful mechanisms to simulate type inference.
(van Noord ~: Bouma 1994) use underspecifiedverb entries and FP~OLOG delayed evaluation tech-niques to insert adjuncts in Dutch VPs withoutusing lexical rules which would cater for the ne-cessary variations of the subcategorisation list ofverbs.
In another proposal using underspeciflc-ation (Sanfilippo 1995) type inference (featurestructure grounding) is simulated by relying onan external mechanism as powerful as PItOLOG.In dealing with different complementation pat-tern phenomena, Sanfilippo constructs type sys-tem fragments where the meet of the alternativecomplements is defined and subtypes verbs accord-ing to complement types.
Therefore, the informa-tion about the alternation is duplicated in the typesystem as it is encoded both on tile complementtypes and the verb types.
The same informationis encoded again on a table of clauses which relatea verbal "meet" type with a maximal complementtype and a maximal verb type.
Such type resolvingclauses are provided for each alternation pattern.PS rules are annotated with procedures which pickup the correct verb type resolving clause when theappropriate complement is encountered.
Both theclauses and the searching procedures are mechan-isms external to the inferencing mechanism that isdirectly related with the type system.
Sanfilippo'sapproach, though powerful and flexible, seems ex-travagant for phenomena like verb alternations ofthe kind discussed here as well as inflection phem-omena of the kind discussed in (Krieger & Ner-bonne 1993).
In such cases the system can takeadvantage of the fact that type inference can bedriven by the combination of the information thatis related to two separate strings (preposition andverb, verb ending and verb stem) as is exemplifiedin our proposal.Furthermore, in our approach no horizontal re-lations exist as the lexicon contains only one entryand no other entry is ever generated.
Instead, thesingle lexical entry is interpreted on the fly, eachtime according to well-specified constraints.
Con-sequently, no ambiguity problems result with anice effect, on parsing time.
In this sense, using un-derspecification defined in the type system is more166econolnic than using lexical rules or a "static" ver-sion of underspecification which is defined in thelexicon.
For instance, (Krieger &: Nerbonne :1993)have used a specialised macro, the so-called dis-tributive (or named) disjunction, in a treatmentof German verb inflectional morphology:While it is true that distributive disjunctiondoes not add any expressive power to the sys-tem (though a piece of machinery, the specialisedmacro, must be supported), if the macro is evercalled all the legal combinations are thereby gemcrated and added to the lexicon.
In this, the situ-ation is precisely the same us with lexieal rules, forin each case, what is provided is simply a compactrepresentation f an ambiguity.This can be also exemplified from the domainof Verb Alternation phenomena.

For the purposes ofexperimentation a grammar fragment was iml)le-mented in the ALEI'  system - a lean formalism witha simple inheritance type system, and a siml)\]econtext free rule backbone.
I:'rocessiug in thissystem is normally divided into separate structurebuilding and feature decoration rule coati>orients ,however for our l>ui'poses no use was made of thisdistinction.For the construction of the VP, a simple rulewas used (VP -+ V NP PP), of the following form(14):04)Id :{a ign=>phrasal : {aynsom=>synsom:{Ioel=>lool:{cat=>cat :{head=>HEAD,subj:>\[SUBJ\] ,comps->\[\]},cont~nt=>Cont ent }}}}< \[l d  : {s ign=>l~ X \[col : {aynsom->syns~m: {loel->locl:{ca%=>cat :<hoad=>llEAD=>vo rb : {},sub j=> \[SUB J} ,comps~> \[OBJ I ,OBJ2\] }contont=>Content}}}}.Id :{si~n=>phPasal :{synsem~>OBJ l~>synsom:{locl=>loel:{taro>cat ;{h~ad=>noun :~}}}}}},ld :{sil~n=>phrasal : {synsom=>OBJ2=>myns om: {locl:>locl :{cat=>cat :{h~ad=>prop : {} }}}}}\] ,The relewmt lexical entries for the fragnientwere as follows.
The verbal entry (load) subcat-egorizes for a single NP subject and NI' and PPcomplenmnts (15).
This entry has underspeeifiedsemantics with respect o the semantic onstraintson its second and third argmnents (as suggestedin (8)).
These are provided by (structure sharingwith) the SI,'M_CONSTI~ feature of third argument,the prepositional phrase (the variable 'Arg3').

To eliminate horizontal re-dundancy, direct relations between descriptions offully formed objects must be defined externally tothe Typed Mulitple Inheritance Network or unin-tuitive solutions must be pursued.
Available ira-plementations of horizontal relations fail to satisfythe reasons that dictate their implementation: theon-need generation of lexical entries and efficientparsing.
Alternatively, we proposed that lexicalentries are descriptions of objects which allow forfurther contextual specification of their propertieson the basis of clearly defined constraints.
Wehave shown that this is an easily implementableproposal even in environments with lean inferencepower and expressivity because it relies on verybasic machinery which is available for independ-ent reasons.This approach can be adopted whenever inforru-a.tion can be distributed among independent sur-face strings.
Under the light of this proposal, manyof the phenomena which have been argued in (Poflard & Sag 1987) to justify the horizontal related-ness approach can be viewed as different 'inter-pretations' of a 'core' lexical entry according towell-specified types of 'context'.
tlowever, it mustbe noted here that this is not always a simple task.Roughly speaking, the less specific the contextualinformation is the more inference power and ex-pressivity is needed to retain the underspecifica-tion approach.ReferencesJoan Bresnan (ed).
