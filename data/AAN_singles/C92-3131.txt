Causal ambiguity in Natural Language: conceptualrepresentation of ' parce que/ because' and ' puisque/ sincdAdeline NAZARENKO-PERRIN - IBM Paris Scientific Center3 et 5 Place Vendome, 75021 Paris Cedex 01, FranceIn t roduct ionThis research deals with the representation f causalrelations found in texts written in natural anguage,in order for KALIPSOS \[1\], an NL-understandlngand question-answering system, to encode causal in-formation in conceptual graphs so as to handlecausal information and reasoning.Natural anguages such as French or English havemany ways to express a causal relation.
It can besyntactic (parce que/because) orlexical (provoquer/toproduce), explicit or implicit (Je me suis cassde lajambe et je n'ai pas pu venir/l broke my leg and Icouldn't come), contained in a single sentence or ex-tended over a whole paragraph.Being partlenlarly interested in explicitly statedcausal information, 1 have studied interproposifionalrelations introduced by paree que/because andpuisque/stnce which are the more specifically causaleonjuuctlons.My approach differs from previous work on causal-ity which was either an attempt to define causal re-latiuns in logic (\[2\] \[3\] \[4\]) or the design of AIsystems for planning and diagnosis 15\].
My researchis based on natural language understanding.If one wants to retrieve and exploit causal informa-tion coded in NL-texts, a semantic analyser thatbuilds an adequate representation f causal inks isneeded.
The importance of this point has beenunderestimated.
For KALIPSOS,  Sowa's Concep-tual Graph theory \[6"I has been taken as a targetrepresentation model; this model can be interpretedin logical terms, thus allowing deduction.
Futureresearch will use these interpretation rules and willexploit extra-lingni~e knowledge for automatedreasoning.
This subject is not addressed in this paperwhich focuses on the semantic analysis problem.Part I explains that the main difficulty in represent-ing the semantics of parce clue~because andpuisque/since is the anchoring of the causal relation.Parts II and III show how to deal with and representthis ambiguity on both syntactic and argumentativelevels.I - P rob lemTo begin with, it should be noted that this researchhas been done on the French language.
The enn-junction since, in English, raises other problems inaddition to those raised by puisque in French, butthey are not dealt with here.
In this paper, since isnever used to introduce a temporal relation.Because of lack of space, I have assumed that thereader is familiar with Sowa's Conceptual Graphmodel and notations \[6\].Traditionally, cause is viewed as a two-argument re-lation.
In the CG-model the relation "X has Y forcause* can be represented as follows (the conceptsare written in boxes and the relations in circles):When studying such a relation three tasks have tobe performed: the first and second arguments (resp.X and Y) have to be identified and the nature of theCAUSE relation has to be determined.1- Identifying the first argument ofparee que/becamseand puisque/since relations is trivial because theseconjunctions introduce a dearly defined subordinateclause.
It would be much more difficult for con-junctions like en effet/actually, done/thus or afnst/so,for instance.2- Determining the nature of the relation is morecomplex.
A cause can be direct or indirect, es~ntialor incidental, deliberate or accidental, several factorsmight be involved, and a cause may vary accordingto the point of view.
But this question cannot besolved on purely semantic grounds.
The conjunc-tions I have studied, in partienlar, and natural an-guage, in general, do not make a systematicdistinction between these types of causes.
I assumethat speakers and listeners either make do with ageneral, basic causal relation or use complementaryinformation about the world.
Therefore, in theKALIPSOS project, 1 have chosen ot to ~ thisquestion during the text encoding phase but to solveit either during the pragmatic analysis or, if needed,during the question-answering phase (informationretrieval process), using extralingnistic knowledge.AcrEs DE COLING-92, NAN'IE$, 23-28 AOt}r 1992 8 8 0 PROC.

AUG. 23-28, 19923- Identifying the mcond argument, however, raisesdifficulties.
The question is to know where to an-chef the causal relation in the main clause graphbecause this anchor may be ambiguous for two tea-sons.?
Syntactic levelYe veux que men flis l'dpouse parce qu'elle estrtche.I want my son to marry her because she is rich.This statement can be inteqneted in two differentways depending on the context:II Je veux que men ills I~#pouse parce qu'elle estfiche.., aiasf, tl ne sera plus d ma charge.I want my son to marry her because she is rich.., thatway I'll no longer have to support him.12 Je veux que men flis r dpouse paree q~(elle st ficheet pas parce q~il gaime.
Les martages d'amour, jen'y erots pas.I want my son to marry her because she is rich andnot because he laves her.
I dor{t believe in lavematches.This syntactic ambiguity will be analysed in moredetail in the second part of this paper.?
Argumentative l velThe Btatement Ha de la flth~e/He has a fever can beconsidered from two points of view, as a fact or asthe ~.akefs action.- Giving the cause of a statement considemt asa fact produces an objective xplanation as in:I1 a de la fldvre paree qu'll est malade.He has a fever because he is sick.where the information "he is sick' answers thequestion Pourquot a-t-tl de la fldvre?/Why doeshe have a fever?- Giving the cause of a statement considered asa speaker's action produces a justification, im-plicating the speaker as in:I1 a de la fldvre puisq~tl est tout rouge/He has a fever since he is flushedlwhere the information "he is flushed" answersthe question Pourqnol dls-tu q~(tl a de laflLh, re?/Why do you say he has a fever?The two intertnetatiom differ with respect o the?
peaker's argumentation: either he explains a fact orhe justifies himself.
This argumentative ambiguitywill be explained in the third part of this paper whereI shall show how it can be represented inconceptualgraph structures containing utterance type concepts.Please note that "utterance" is used in the ~nse ofthe act of uttering, not that which is uttered.II - Syntactic ambiguity when anchoringcausal relations(1) Je veux que mon flis g6pouse parce qu~elle stfiche.I want my son to marry her because she is rich.The ambiguity (ll and 12) cotreJpondn to differentsyntactic analyses (Al-broad ~eope and A2-narrow~eope):AI \[Je veux que mon flls f ~pouse\] parce q~elle riche.\[I want my son to marry her\] because she is rich.A2 Je veux que \[mon ills g?pouse parce q~elleriche\].I want \[my son to marry her because she ts rich\].Except for the case where the conjunction follows acomma (which rules out the second syntaetle analy-m), I suggest that the statement istotally ambiguousand that it is impossible to choose between theseinterpretations o11 syntactic grounds.
The parsermust deliver two syntactic trees.The semantic analyser, however, must ry to chooseone reading only.
There is no guaranteed determin-ing factor but some dues may combine in favour ofone or other interpretation.
Three of these clues areshown below: coreferenee of pronouns, temporalcorrespondence and encyclopedic knowledge.Coreference o f  pronouns(2) J'al dtt que Pierre partalt parce que ca iatchantatt.I said that Peter was leaving because he felt like It.
(3) J'ai dlt que Pierre partatt parce que ca meehantait, I said that Peter was leaving because l feltlike it.Coreference of underlined pronouns favours thenarrow scope interpretation for statement (2) and thebroad scope one for statement (3).
However, no in-terpretation is really ruled out.Although the definition of precise rules seems diffi-cult and still has to be worked out, 1 think that thiscoreference is a factor in the cognitive process ofnatural disambiguation.Tempora l  correspondenceIt is useful to remember that an effect cannot precedeits cause in time and that this temporal informationcan be computed.
It depends on the choice of tenses,on the aspeetual indications and on the situationcharacteristics given in the semantic definitions of theverbs.
Several models of temporal representationusing conceptual graphs have been designed andimplemented \[7\].
The ~mantic analy~-r can u~information to ~b iguate  a ~atement.Je pense qu'tl a ma~ parce qu'll y a du foutllis.I think he has eaten becouse there is a mess.The tenses how that the mess comes after the actionof eating.
Therefore, the mess cannot be the causeof that action and the narrow neope interprt.

"llais information rules outthe narrow scope interpretation for the above state-ment.Common sense knowledge may be the most impor-tant factor of disambiguation.
Sowa's model hastools to enende this kind of knowledge but the rele-vant information, which is not semantic but prag-marie, must be defined in connection with a specificapplication.For statement (1) and similar statements he parsermust deliver two different analyses.
The semanticanalyser tries to remove the =tmbigtfity using a set ofcombined clues.l l I  - A rgumentat ive  ambigu i ty  whenanchor ing  causa l  re la t ionsSuggested representatlouA statement such as(4) I1 est malade pulsq~(tl a de ta fl~vre.He is sfek since he has a fever.cannot be paraphrased by11 est malade parce qdtl a de la fldvrc.He is sick because he has a fever.which would contradict our basic knowledge of ill-ness and fever, it would be better to paraphrase (4)with one of the following statements:- Je dis (pense, erois, suppose, etc.)
qu'tl estmalade parce qdtl a de la fldvre.- I say (think, assume, imagine, etc.)
he is sickbecause he has a fever.
(meaning He Is sick andI say so because he has a fever.
)These paraphrases bring out the speaker's activitywhich remains implicit in (4).
Although there maybe different kinds of activity (epistemic, cognitive,speech, etc.)
they shall all be considered here as ut-terances, ince the problem I wish to address is thatof finding the proper structure to represent causalrelations.The above paraphrases how that statement (4)could be represented asfollows:Figure 1.
Conceptual graph for "He h sick sincehe has a feverF': in lids graph, theconcept type of the U-node (utterance)is different from that of the Prop-nodes(proposition).
The U-node represenlsthe speech situation whose dreumetancesform the dependency relations.Consequence,~Several remarks can be made about the suggestedrepresentation,1- Fever is no longer considered as a cause of illness;it causes the speaker's declaration 11 est malade/Heis sick.2- In figure 1, proposition 1is not in the scope ofU as it does not belong to its theme.
Actually, asO.
Duerot has shown \[8\], there are two successiveutterances in a statement such as (4).
This is easilyexplained if we acknowledge that the informationintroduced by puisque/since is already known.
As apresupposed piece of information it cannot be stated;in the representation I have chosen it cannot be thetheme of an utterance.3- The suggested representation shows that it is nec-essary to introduce a new type of concept (U) in or-der to represent the speech situation (which is not aproposition) and the related linguistic phenomena.1 suggest that this type of concept will enhance theanalysis of linguistic phenomena such as modality,temporal relations, reported speech, or any factsdealing with the elreumstanees surrounding an ut-terance.
For instance, let us consider a woman whosays to a child: Va darts ta chambrel/Go to yourroom/ This statement and its context could be re-presented by the graph shown in figure 2.\ [~  - - - - - - - -~  ~ - - - - - - -~  ~Figure 2.

AUG. 23-28, 1992I have shown how puisque/since statements mightbe represented.
I have also argued that it is necessaryto introduce a U-type concept (U-node) into theCG-modd so that utterance-related linguistic phe-nomena can be taken into account.
However, inorder to represent interpropositional causal inks, itmust be possible to build the proper epresentationautomatically.
Two questions follow: when is itneceessary to have a U-node in the graph of themain danse7 Where should a causal relation be an-chored in the modified representation7U-nodesAny sentence, written, spoken or even reported, isthe responsibility of a speaker (at this point, para-graph or text levels are not considered).
This leadsto a first rule:Rule I: A graph representing a sentence must de-pend on a U-node.Any variation in the speech situation (change inpoint of view, in assertiveness, etc.)
must also be in-dicated.
The llst of variations is open but mainlyconcerns verbs (dire/to say, croire/Zo believe,penser/to think, etc.)
which introduce reportedspeech or a new point of view.Rule 2: Verbs that hltroduce reported speech or apoint of view must be defined as an utterance (U-type concept).Figures 3 and 4 give examples of the application ofzules 1 and 2.
A further analysis of the utteranceactivity would refine and extend these rules becausemodality and other linguistic phenomena may inter-fere.
As we are not concerned here by the dis-tinctions between the different kinds of utterance(episternic, belief, etc.)
and the interpretation rulesassociated with them, we have left the modality ofU-nodes unresolved.Figure 3.
Example of the application of rule I (11cat malade/He is sick): the identifica-tion of the variable *x which refers to thespeaker is given contextually.Verb (to say) isFigure 4.
Example of the applicatim, of rule2: straJcture of the dethfilion of to nay(unresolved modality isput in quote~).AnchoringAs the representation of the main elaine becomesmore complex the number of anchoring po~fi "bflitiesincreases and it is necessary to determine which onesare legitimate.As already explained above, parce que/because andputsque/slnce differ more by the type of their firstargument than the nature of the causal relation.Parce que/becaz~e r lations are usually anchored toa proposition whereas putsque/slnce relations areusually anchored to an utterance.Rule 3: A causal relation expressed by pureeque/because must be anchored to a propositionalnode of a conceptual graph.According to this rule, in the statement(5) Je dis qt/il a de la fi~re puree qu'tl eat malade.I say that he has a f te r  because he is sick.anchoring can be done in two ways (the statementis syntactically ambiguous) leading to the graphsshown in figures 5 and 6.h=,0Figure 5.

As noted above these relations cannotbe stated, they cannot combine to form a proposi-tion.Rule 5."
A causal relation referred to by puisque/sincecannot appear in a propositional node of a concep-tual graph.

Example of the application of rulea 4 and5: the causal relation must (rule 4) beanchored to a U-node but not to U-nodenumber 2 which would break rule 5 be-cause the "pulsque'fsince" relationwould fall into the propositional themeOarge box) of U-node number I.Conc lus ionTI~ study of parce que/because and puisque/sincehas shown that the question "Cause of what?"
is evenmore important than the question "What kind ofcause.~.
The main task has been to uncover andrepresent the ambiguity (both syntactic andargumentative) ofthese conjunctions.Although linguistic phenomena (coreference of pro-nouns and tempond correspondence) and encyclo-pedic knowledge may help to ~edu~ the syntacticambiguity, there is no guaranteed determining factor.The importance of argumentative characteristics hadto be taken into account; consequently I have intro-duced a new type of concept to xepresent the utter-ance situation.
This concept type allows the parceque/because and puisque/sinee r lations to be prop-erly represented in the form of conceptual graphsttoctu~s.
In addition, 1 have defined rules to allowthe KALIPSOS semantic analyser to build mlehstn~ures automatically.Further work has to be done.
The example of thedefinition of dire/to say can be extended to encodeother verbs (croire/to believe, penser/to think,supposer/to suppose, nierlto deny, etc.).
It will benecessary to distinguish between different ypes ofutterance nodes in conceptual graphs.Since the conceptual ~.xuctures that have been builtmust enable catutal questions to be answered, it isalso necessary to define rules so that thequestion/answering system can handle the utterancetype concept nodes.References\[I\] A.
