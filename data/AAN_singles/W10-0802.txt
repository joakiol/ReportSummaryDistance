We search a tagged and dependency-parsed BNC (a 100-million word corpus of Eng-lish) for Verb-Argument Constructions (VACs) in-cluding those previously identified in the pattern grammar resulting from the COBUILD project.
This generates (1) a list of verb types that occupy each construction.
We next tally the frequency pro-files of these verbs to produce (2) a frequency ranked type-token distribution for these verbs, and we determine the degree to which this is Zipfian.
Since some verbs are faithful to one construction while others are more promiscuous, we next pro-duce (3) a contingency-weighted list reflecting their statistical association.
To test whether each of these measures is a step towards increasing the learnability of VACs as categories, following prin-ciples of associative learning, we examine 20 verbs from each distribution.
Here we explore whether there is an increase in the semantic cohesion of the verbs occupying each construction using semantic similarity measures.
From inspection, this seems to be so.
We are developing measures of this using network measures of clustering in the verb-space defined by WordNet and Roget?s Thesaurus.
1 Construction grammar and Usage Constructions are form-meaning mappings, conventionalized in the speech community, and entrenched as language knowledge in the learner?s mind.
They are the symbolic units of language re-lating the defining properties of their morphologi-cal, lexical, and syntactic form with particular se-mantic, pragmatic, and discourse functions (Goldberg, 2006).
Construction Grammar argues that all grammatical phenomena can be understood as learned pairings of form (from morphemes, words, idioms, to partially lexically filled and fullygeneral phrasal patterns) and their associated se-mantic or discourse functions: ?the network of constructions captures our grammatical knowledge in toto, i.e.
It?s constructions all the way down?
(Goldberg, 2006, p. 18).
Such beliefs, increasingly influential in the study of child language acquisi-tion, have turned upside down generative assump-tions of innate language acquisition devices, the continuity hypothesis, and top-down, rule-governed, processing, bringing back data-driven, emergent accounts of linguistic systematicities.
Frequency, learning, and language come to-gether in usage-based approaches which hold that we learn linguistic constructions while engaging in communication.
The last 50 years of psycholin-guistic research provides the evidence of usage-based acquisition in its demonstrations that lan-guage processing is exquisitely sensitive to usage frequency at all levels of language representation from phonology, through lexis and syntax, to sen-tence processing (Ellis, 2002).
Language knowl-edge involves statistical knowledge, so humans learn more easily and process more fluently high frequency forms and ?regular?
patterns which are exemplified by many types and which have few competitors.
Psycholinguistic perspectives thus hold that language learning is the associative learn-ing of representations that reflect the probabilities of occurrence of form-function mappings.
Fre-quency is a key determinant of acquisition because ?rules?
of language, at all levels of analysis from phonology, through syntax, to discourse, are struc-tural regularities which emerge from learners?
life-time unconscious analysis of the distributional characteristics of the language input.
If constructions as form-function mappings are the units of language, then language acquisition involves inducing these associations from experi-ence of language usage.
Constructionist accounts of language acquisition thus involve the distribu-tional analysis of the language stream and the par-allel analysis of contingent perceptuo-motor activ-9ity, with abstract constructions being learned as categories from the conspiracy of concrete exem-plars of usage following statistical learning mecha-nisms (Bod, Hay, & Jannedy, 2003; Bybee & Hopper, 2001; Ellis, 2002) relating input and learner cognition.
Psychological analyses of the learning of constructions as form-meaning pairs is informed by the literature on the associative learn-ing of cue-outcome contingencies where the usual determinants include: (1) input frequency (type-token frequency, Zipfian distribution, recency), (2) form (salience and perception), (3) function (proto-typicality of meaning, importance of form for mes-sage comprehension, redundancy), and (4) interac-tions between these (contingency of form-function mapping) (Ellis & Cadierno, 2009).
2 Determinants of construction learning In natural language, Zipf?s law (Zipf, 1935) de-scribes how a handful of the highest frequency words account for the most linguistic tokens.
Zipf?s law states that the frequency of words de-creases as a power function of their rank in the fre-quency table.
If pf is the proportion of words whose frequency rank in a given language sample is f, then pf ~ f -b, with b ?
1.
Zipf showed this scaling relation holds across a wide variety of language samples.
Subsequent research provides support for this law as a linguistic universal: many language events (e.g., frequencies of phoneme and letter strings, of words, of grammatical constructs, of formulaic phrases, etc.)
across scales of analysis follow this law (Sol?, Murtra, Valverde, & Steels, 2005).
Goldberg, Casenhiser & Sethuraman (2004) demonstrated that in samples of child language acquisition, for a variety of verb-argument con-structions (VACs), there is a strong tendency for one single verb to occur with very high frequency in comparison to other verbs used, a profile which closely mirrors that of the mothers?
speech to these children.
Goldberg et al (2004) show that Zipf?s law applies within VACs too, and they argue that this promotes acquisition: tokens of one particular verb account for the lion?s share of instances of each particular argument frame; this pathbreaking verb also is the one with the prototypical meaning from which the construction is derived (see also Ninio, 1999).Ellis and Ferreira-Junior (2009) investigate ef-fects upon naturalistic second language acquisition of type/token distributions in three English verb-argument constructions.
They show that VAC verb type/token distribution in the input is Zipfian and that learners first acquire the most frequent, proto-typical and generic exemplar.
(e.g.
put in VOL [verb-object-locative], give in VOO [verb-object-object], etc.).
Acquisition is affected by the fre-quency distribution of exemplars within each is-land of the construction, by their prototypicality, and, using a variety of psychological (Shanks, 1995) and corpus linguistic association metrics (Gries & Stefanowitsch, 2004), by their contin-gency of form-function mapping.
This fundamental claim that Zipfian distributional properties of lan-guage usage helps to make language learnable has thus begun to be explored for these three VACs, at least.
It remains an important research agenda to explore its generality across a wide range of con-structions (i.e.
the constructicon).
The primary motivation of construction gram-mar is that we must bring together linguistic form, learner cognition, and usage.
An important conse-quence is that constructions cannot be defined purely on the basis of linguistic form, or semantics, or frequency of usage alone.
All three factors are necessary in their operationalization and measure-ment.
Our research aims to do this.
We hope to describe the verbal grammar of English, to analyze the way VACs map form and meaning, and to pro-vide an inventory of the verbs that exemplify con-structions and their frequency.
This last step is necessary because the type-token frequency distri-bution of their verbs determines VAC acquisition as abstract schematic constructions, and because usage frequency determines their entrenchment and processing.
This paper describes and pilots our approach.
We focus on just two constructions for illustration here (V across n, and V Obj Obj) although our procedures are principled, generic and applicable to all VACs.
We search a tagged and dependency-parsed British National Corpus (a 100-million word corpus of English) for VACs including those previously identified in the COBUILD pattern grammar project.
This generates (1) a list of verb types that occupy each construction.
We next tally the frequency profiles of these verbs to produce (2) a frequency ranked type-token distribution for these verbs, and we determine the degree to which10this is Zipfian.
Since some verbs are faithful to one construction while others are more promiscuous, we next produce (3) a contingency-weighted list which reflects their statistical association.
3 Method As a starting point, we considered several of the major theories and datasets of construction gram-mar such as FrameNet (Fillmore, Johnson, & Petruck, 2003).
However, because our research aims to empirically determine the semantic asso-ciations of particular linguistic forms, it is impor-tant that such forms are initially defined by bot-tom-up means that are semantics-free.
There is no one in corpus linguistics who ?trusts the text?
more than Sinclair (2004).
Therefore we chose the Pat-tern Grammar (Francis et al 1996) definition of Verb constructions  that arose out of his Cobuild project.
3.1 Construction inventory: COBUILD Verb Patterns  The form-based patterns described in the CO-BUILD Verb Patterns volume (Francis et al 1996) take the form of word class and lexis combina-tions, such as V across n, V into n and V n n. For each of these patterns the resource provides infor-mation as to the structural configurations and func-tional/meaning groups found around these patterns through detailed concordance analysis of the Bank of English corpus during the construction of the COBUILD dictionary.
For instance, the following is provided for the V across n pattern (Francis, et al, 1996, p. 150):  The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase which consists of across and a noun group.
This pattern has one structure: * Verb with Adjunct.
I cut across the field.
Further example sentences are provided drawn from the corpus and a list of verbs found in the pattern and that are semantically typical are given.
For this pattern these are: brush, cut, fall, flicker, flit plane, skim, sweep.
No indication is given as to how frequent each of these types are or how com-prehensive the list is.
Further structural (syntacti-cal) characteristics of the pattern are sometimesprovided, such as the fact that for V across n the prepositional phrase is an adjunct and that the verb is never passive.
For some construction patterns with a gener-ally fixed order it may be sufficient just to specify combinations of word and part-of-speech se-quences.
For example, a main verb followed by across within 1 to 3 words (to allow for adverbial elements), followed by a noun or pronoun within a few words.
To such constraints a number excep-tions of what should not occur within the specified spans must be added.
The variation and potential complexity of English noun phrases presents chal-lenges for this approach.
On the other hand a multi-level constituent parse tree provides more than needed.
A dependency parse with word-to-word relations is well suited for the task.
3.2 Corpus: BNC XML Parsed  The analysis of verb type-token distribution in the kinds of construction patterns described in the pre-vious section should ideally be carried out using a range of corpora in the magnitude of the tens or hundreds of millions of words as the original work is derived from the Bank of English (a growing monitor corpus of over 400 million words).
These corpora should, at the least, be part-of-speech tagged to search for the pattern as specified.
Fur-ther some kind of partial parsing and chunking is necessary to apply the structural constraints (see Mason & Hunston, 2004 for exploratory methodology).
We chose to use the 100 million word British National Corpus (BNC) on account of its size, the breadth of genres it contains and con-sistent lemmatization and part-of-speech tagging.
Andersen et al (2008) parsed the XML version of the BNC using the RASP parser (Briscoe, Carroll, & Watson, 2006).
RASP is a statistical feature-based parser that produces  a probabilistically or-dered set of parse trees for a given sentence and additionally a set of grammatical relations (GRs) that capture ?those aspects of predicate-argument structure that the system is able to recover and is the most stable and grammar independent repre-sentation available?
(Briscoe, et al, 2006, p. 79).
The GRs are organized into a hierarchy of depend-ency relations, including distinctions between modifiers and arguments and within arguments between subject (sub) and complements (comp).
Figure 1 shows the GRs assigned by RASP for the11sentence: The kitchen light skids across the lawn (BNC A0U).
The main verb skids has two argu-ments, a subject (ncsubj) and indirect object (iobj), and the preposition one argument (dobj).
Figure 1.
Example of RASP GRs  The RASP GR hierarchy does not include catego-ries such as prepositional complement or adjunct.
Figure 2 shows the GRs for another sentence con-taining across which is not an example of the V across n pattern.
Alternate analyses might attach across directly to the main verb threw, but at least from examining BNC examples containing across, it appears RASP tends to favor local attachments (also for towards in this case).Figure 2.
Example of RASP GRs  The GRs from RASP have been incorporated into the XML for each BNC sentence thereby preserv-ing the token, part-of-speech and lemma informa-tion in the corpus.
3.3 Searching construction patterns  Our search algorithm works as follows:  1.
Process each sentence in turn testing against an XPath expression to identify components in construction patterns, e.g.
.//w[@lem="across"][@pos="PREP"]/ preceding-sibling::w[position()<3] [@pos="VERB"][1] finds a verb followed by across within 2 words.
2.
Create a list of the grammatical relations where this verb functions as the head.
i.
This finds the ncsubj and iobj rela-tions for the example sentence.
ii.
Also find GRs involving other components of pattern (e.g.
across).
3.
Check these GRs against a constraint list, e.g.
make sure thati.
only one relation where the dependent word comes after the verb (excluding verbs with both dobj and iobj or obj2) ii.
the dependent of the second component matches a specific part-of-speech (e.g.
across as head and noun as dependent).
4.
For matching sentences record verb lemma.
Here we report on just two construction patterns: 1.
V across n and 2.
V n n or V Obj Obj (where n includes both nouns and pronouns).
We have also run a range of similar V Prep n patterns from CO-BUILD, such as V into n, V after n, V as n. We have still to carry out a systematic precision-recall analysis, but ad hoc examination suggests that the strict constraints using the dependency relations provides a reasonable precision and the size of the corpus results in a large enough number of tokens to carry out distributional analysis (see Table 1).
Construction Types Tokens TTR V across n 799 4889 16.34 V Obj Obj 663 9183 7.22  Table 1.
Type-Token data for V across n and V Obj Obj constructions 3.4 Identifying the meaning of verb types occu-pying the constructions We considered several ways of analyzing the semantics the resulting verb distributions.
It is im-portant that the semantic measures we employ are defined in a way that is free of linguistic distribu-tional information, otherwise we would be building in circularity.
Therefore methods such as LSA are not applicable here.
Instead, our research utilizes two distribution-free semantic databases: (1) Ro-get?s thesaurus, a classic lexical resource of long-standing proven utility, based on Roget?s guided introspections, as implemented in the Open Ro-get?s Project (Kennedy, 2009).
This provides vari-ous algorithms for measuring the semantic similar-ity between terms and between sentences.
(2) WordNet, based upon psycholinguistic theory and in development since 1985 (Miller, 2009).
Word-Net classes words into a hierarchical network.
At the top level, the hierarchy for verbs is organized into 15 base types (such as move1 expressing trans-lational movement and move2 movement without displacement, communicate, etc.)
which then split into over 11,500 verb synonym sets or synsets.12Verbs are linked in the hierarchy according to rela-tions such as hypernym (to move is an hypernym of to walk), and troponym, the term used for hypo-nymic relations in the verb component of WordNet (to lisp is a troponym of to talk).
There are various algorithms to determine the semantic similarity between synsets in WordNet which consider the distance between the conceptual categories of words, as well as considering the hierarchical structure of the WordNet (Pedersen et al 2004).
3.5 Determining the contingency between construction form and function Some verbs are closely tied to a particular con-struction (for example, give is highly indicative of the ditransitive construction, whereas leave, al-though it can form a ditransitive, is more often as-sociated with other constructions such as the sim-ple transitive or intransitive).
The more reliable the contingency between a cue and an outcome, the more readily an association between them can be learned (Shanks, 1995), so constructions with more faithful verb members are more transparent and thus should be more readily acquired.
Ellis and Ferreira-Junior (2009) use ?P and collostructional analysis measures (Stefanowitsch & Gries, 2003) to show effects of form-function contingency upon L2 VAC acquisition.
Others use conditional prob-abilities to investigate contingency effects in VAC acquisition.
This is still an active area of inquiry, and more research is required before we know which statistical measures of form-function con-tingency are more predictive of acquisition and processing.
Meanwhile, the simplest usable meas-ure is one of faithfulness ?
the proportion of tokens of total verb usage as a whole that appear in this particular construction.
For illustration, the faith-fulness of give to the ditransitive is approximately 0.40; that for leave is 0.01.
4 Results 4.1 Evaluating the verb distribution  For the V across n pattern the procedure outlined in the previous section results in the following list:  come 483     walk 203 ...    cut 199 veer 4   run 175 whirl 4 ...spread 146 slice 4 discharge 1 ...  clamber 4 navigate 1   ...  scythe 1     scroll 1Figure 3.
Verb type distribution for V across n  At first glance this distribution does appear to be Zipfian, exhibiting the characteristic long-tailed distribution in a plot of rank against frequency.
Dorogovstev & Mendes (2003, pp.
222-223) out-line the commonly used methods for measuring power-law distributions: 1. a simple log-log plot (rank/frequency), 2. log-log plot of cumulative probability against frequency and 3. the use of logarithmic binning over the distribution for a log-log plot as in 2.
Linear regression can be applied to the resulting plots and goodness of fit (R2) and the slope (?)
recorded.
Figure 3 shows such a plot for verb type fre-quency of the V across n construction pattern ex-tracted from the parsed BNC XML corpus follow-ing the third plotting method.
Verb types are grouped into 20 logarithmic bins according to their frequency (x-axis) against the logarithm of the cu-mulative probability of a verb occurring with or above this frequency (y-axis).
Each point repre-sents one bin and a verb from each group is ran-13domly selected to label the point with its token fre-quency in parentheses.
For example, the type look occurs 102 times in the V across n pattern and is placed into the 15th bin with the types go, lie and lean.
Points towards the lower right of the plot in-dicate high-frequency low-type groupings and those towards the top left low-frequency high-type groupings, that is the fat- or long-tail of the distri-bution.
Looking at the verbs given as examples of the pattern in COBUILD volume we find all but plane represented in our corpus search V across n: brush (12 tokens, group 9), cut (199 tokens, group 18), fall (57, g14), flicker (21, g10), flit (15, g9), plane (0), skim (9, g8), sweep (34, g12).Figure 4.
Verb type distribution for V Obj Obj  Figure 4 shows the plot for verb type frequency of the ditransitive V Obj Obj construction pattern ex-tracted and binned in the same way.
Both distribu-tions can be fitted with a straight regression line (R2=0.993).
Thus we conclude that the type-token frequency distributions for these constructions are Zipfian.
(In future we will investigate the other plot and fitting methods to ensure we have not smoothed the data too much through binning.)
In-spection of the construction verb types, from most frequent down, also suggests that, as in prior re-search (Ellis & Ferreira-Junior, 2009; Goldberg etal., 2004; Ninio, 1999), the most frequent items are prototypical of the construction and more generic in their action semantics.
4.2 Evaluating the roles of frequency distribu-tion and faithfulness in semantic cohesion  The second step in evaluating the verb distribu-tions from the construction patterns is to compare a small set of types selected on the basis of a flat type distribution, the (Zipfian) token frequency distribution and a distribution that represents the degree to which a verb is attracted to the particular construction.
First we select the top 200 types from the two VACs, ordered by token frequency.
Then we sample 20 verbs from this list at random.
This is the ?types list?.
Next we take the top 20 types as the ?tokens list?.
Finally, we calculate the token-ized faithfulness score for each type by dividing the verb?s frequency in the construction by its overall frequency in the whole BNC.
For example, spread occurs 146 times in the V across n pattern and 5503 times in total.
So its faithfulness is 146/5503*100 = 2.65%, i.e.
1 in 38, of the in-stances of spread occur as spread across n. The tokenized faithfulness score for spread is then simply (146/5503) * 146 = 3.87, which tempers the tendency for low frequency types such as scud, skitter and emblazon to rise to the top of the list and is our initial attempt to combine the effects of token frequency and construction contingency.
We reorder the 200 types by this figure and take the top twenty for the ?faithfulness list?.
Tables 2 and 3 contain these lists for the two constructions.
An intuitive reading of these lists suggests that the to-kens list captures the most general and prototypical senses (walk, move etc.
for V across n and give, make, tell, offer for V Obj Obj), while the list or-dered by tokenized faith highlights some quite construction specific (and low frequency) items, such as scud, flit and flicker for V across n.  The final component is to quantify the seman-tic coherence or ?clumpiness?
of the verbs ex-tracted in the previous steps.
For this we use WordNet and Roget?s.
Pedersen et al (2004) out-line six measures in their Perl WordNet::Similarity package, three (path, lch and wup) based on the path length between concepts in WordNet Synsets and three (res, jcn and lin) that incorporate a  measure called ?information content?
related to concept specificity.
Tables 4 and 5 show the simi-14larity scores that result from taking the 20 types in each of the lists in Tables 2 and 3 and generating a 20 by 20 distance matrix.
types (sample) tokens faithfulness 1 scuttle come spread 2 ride walk scud 3 paddle cut sprawl 4 communicate run cut 5 rise spread walk 6 stare move come 7 drift look stride 8 stride go lean 9 face lie flit 10 dart lean stretch 11 flee stretch run 12 skid fall scatter 13 print get skitter 14 shout pass flicker 15 use reach slant 16 stamp travel scuttle 17 look fly stumble 18 splash stride sling 19 conduct scatter skid 20 scud sweep flash Table 2.

Top 20 types for V Obj Obj ordered by types, tokens and construction faithfulness  The figures are the mean of the values in each ma-trix.
Path and lin values range between 0 and 1, Open Roget between 4 and 16 and the others areon varying scales where larger values indicate greater similarity.
These tables show that the token distribution sample of verb types increases the se-mantic cohesion of the construction over a flat verbs list.
Similarity measure Types (sampled) Tokens (top 20) Faithfulness (top 20) WordNet    path 0.163 0.387 0.245 lch 0.941 1.976 1.385 wup 0.312 0.653 0.453 res 2.473 4.673 3.748 jcn 1.033 0.383 0.190 lin  0.259 0.583 0.372 Open Roget 5.190 11.737 6.232 Table 4.
Semantic similarity measures for V across n by types, tokens and construction faithfulness  Similarity measure Types (sampled) Tokens (top 20) Faithfulness (top 20) WordNet    path 0.175 0.316 0.241 lch 1.008 1.654 1.299 wup 0.345 0.579 0.457 res 2.470 3.942 2.973 jcn 0.199 0.435 0.313 lin 0.308 0.558 0.406 Open Roget 7.863 13.011 10.768 Table 5.
Semantic similarity measures for V Obj Obj by types, tokens and construction faithfulness  Sampling the items on the basis of their token fre-quency weighted for faithfulness also improves semantic homogeneity, although it does not here offer any improvement over a tokenized distribu-tion alone.
We not entirely satisfied with these measures.
WordNet verb hierarchies are much flat-ter and bushier than those for nouns, where these measures are more successful.
For verbs, distance down a synset is less telling than distance across.
As a result, we are exploring other measures of the semantic similarity of verbs informed by network science.
We are also exploring the use of word sense disambiguation techniques to reduce prob-lems introduced by the rich polysemy of verbs in WordNet (e.g.
give is assigned to 44 different syn-sets) and also in Roget?s.
Future work  We plan to apply these methods to the full range of English VACs as described in Francis et al(1996)15and other construction grammars too.
We are par-ticularly interested in whether the inventory repre-sents an optimal partitioning of verb semantics, starting with basic categories of action semantics and proceeding to greater specificity via Zipfian mapping.
We are also interested in extending these approaches to learner language to investigate whether first and second language learners?
acqui-sition follows the construction distributional pro-files and whether the factors outlined in Goldberg et al (2004) facilitate acquisition.
There have been suggestions that Zipfian type-token frequency distributions are essentially unin-teresting artifacts.
For each motivated construction identified along the lines described in 3.3, we have begun to make matching random control distribu-tions generated as a random selection of verb types of comparable n types and tokens (yoked ersatz-controls).
For each of our outcome measures, we will compare the various scores for VAC verb-types gathered on the principled basis of construc-tion-grammar against those for their controls.
Conclusions Meanwhile, these pilot studies show some promise in these methods towards an English verb grammar operationalized as an inventory of VACs, their verb membership and their type-token frequency distributions, their contingency of mapping, and their semantic motivations.
