czAbst rac tIn this paper, a treatment of Czechphonological rules in two-level mor-phology approach is described.
Firstthe possible phonological alternationsin Czech are listed and then theirtreatment in a practical application ofa Czech morphological lexicon.1 Motivat ionIn this paper I want to describe the way in whichI treated the phonological changes that occur inCzech conjugation, declension and derivation.My work concerned the written language, butas spelling of Czech is based on phonologicalprinciples, moSt statements will be true aboutphonology, too,My task was to encode an existing Czech mor-phological dictionary (Haji~, 1994) as a finitestate transducer.
The existing lexicon was orig-inally designed :for simple C programs that onlyattach "endings" to the "stems".
The quota-tion marks in the previous entence mean thatthe terms are not used in the linguistic mean-ing but rather, technically: Stem means anypart of a word: that is not changed in declen-sion/conjugation.
Ending means the real endingand possibly also another part of the word thatis changed.
Wh:en I started the work on convert-ing this lexicon to a two-level morphology sys-tem, the first idea was that it should be linguis-tically more elegant and accurate.
This requiredme to redesign the set of patterns and their cor-responding endings.
From the original numberof 219 paradigms I got 159 that use 116 sets ofendings.
Under the term paradigm I mean theset of endings that belong to one lemma (e.g.noun endings for all seven cases in both num-bers) and possible derivations with their cor-responding endings (e.g.
possessive adjectivesderived from nouns in all possible forms).
Thatis why the number of paradigms is higher thenthe number of endings.In this approach, it is necessary to deal withthe phonological changes that occur at bound-aries between the stem and the suffix/ending orbetween the suffix and the ending.
There arealso changes inside the stem (e.g.
p~'tel 'friend'x p~dteld 'friends', or hndt 'to chase' x 5enu'I chase'), but I will not deal with them, asthey are rather rare and irregular.
They aretreated in the lexicon as exceptions.
I also willnot deal with all the changes that may occur ina verb stem--this would require reconstructingthe forms of the verbs back in the 14th cen-tury, which is outside the scope:of my work.Instead, I work with several stems of these ir-regular verbs.
For example the verb hndt ('tochase') has three different stems, hnd- for infini-tive, 5en- for the present ense, imperative andpresent participles, and hna- for the past par-ticiples.
The verb vdst ('to lead') has two stems,vds- for the infinitive and ved- for all finite formsand participles.
The verb tit ('to cut') has thestem tn- in the present ense, and the stem ra-in the past tense; the participles can be formedboth from the present and the past stem.
Forpractical reasons we work either with one verbstem (for regular verbs) or with six stems (forirregular verbs).
These six stems are stems for4-1infinitive, present indicative, imperative, pastparticiple, transgressive and passive participle.In fact, there is no verb in Czech with six differ-ent stems, but this division is made because ofvarious combinations of endings with the stems.2 Types  o f  phono log ica l  a l te rnat ionsin CzechWe will deal with three types of phonologicalalternations: palatalization, assimilation andepenthesis.
Palatalization occurs mainly in de-clension and partly also in conjugation.
Assimi-lation occurs mainly in conjugation.
Epenthesisoccurs both in declension and in conjugation.2.1 Epenthes isAn epenthetic e occurs in a group of consonantsbefore a O-ending.
The final group of conso-nants can consist of a suffix (e.g.
-k or -b) anda part of the stem; in this case the epenthesisobligatory (e.g.
kousek x kousku 'piece', malbax maleb 'painting').
In cases when the groupis morphologically unseparable, the applicationof epenthesis depends on whether the group ofconsonants i phonetically admissable at wordend.
In loan words, the epenthetic e may occurif the final group of consonants reminds a Czechsuffix (e.g.
korek x korku 'cork', but alba x alb'alb').
In declension, two situations can occur:?
The base form contains an epenthetic e; therule has to remove it, if the form has anon-O ending, e.g.
chlapec 'boy', chlapcidative/locative sg or nominative pl.?
The base form has a non-O ending; the rulehas to insert an epenthetic e, if the endingis O, e.g.
chodba 'corridor', chodeb genitivepl.In conjugation, an epenthetic e occurs in thepast participle, masculine sg of the verb jit 'togo' (and its prefixed derivations): gel 'he-gone',gla 'she-gone', glo 'it-gone'.
The rule has to in-sert an epenthetic e if the form has a O-ending.2.2 Pa la ta l i za t ion  and  ass imi lat ionPalatalization or assimilation at the morphemeboundaries occurs when an ending/suffix startswith a soft vowel.
The alternations are differentfor different ypes of consonants.
The types ofconsonants and vowels are as follows:?
hard consonants--d, (g,)h, ch, k, n, r, t?
soft consonants--c, d, d, j, ~, ?, g, t, 2?
neutral consonants--b, l, m; p, s, v, z?
hard vowels--a, d, e, d, o, 6, u, ~, y, ~\] andthe diphthong ou?
soft vowels--d, i, (The vowel d cannot occur in the ending/suffixso it will not be interesting for us.
I also will notdiscuss what happens with 'foreign' consonants/, q, w and x--they would be treated as v, k,v and s, respectively.
The only borrowing fromforeign languages that I included to the abovelists is g: This sound existed in Old Slavonic butin Czech it changed into h. However, when laternew words with g were adopted from other lan-guages, this sound behaved phonologically as h(e.g.
hloh, hlozich--from Common Slavonic glog'hawthorn', and katalog, kataloz(ch 'catalog').The phonological alternations are reflected inwriting, with one exception--if  the consonantsd, n and t are followed by a soft vowel, they arepalatalized, but the spelling is not changed:spelling: d~, di phonology: /de / , /d i /ne, ni I el, la lt~, ti / \[e/, / \[i/In other cases the spelling reflects the phonol-ogy.
In the further text I will use { } for themorpho-phonological level, / / for the phonolog-ical level and no brackets for the orthographicallevel.
In the cases where the orthography andphonology are the same I will only use the or-thographical level.
Let us look at the possibletypes of alternation of consonants:?
Soft consonant and ~- -  The soft consonantis not changed, the soft ~ is changed to e.{d(d@} ---+ d(de 'pussycat' dative sg?
Soft or neutral consonant and i / ( - -  No al-ternations occur.
{ d(di} ~ didi 'pussycat' genitive sg?
Hard consonant and a soft vowel - -  Thealternations differ depending on when andhow the soft vowel originated.Assimilation:- {k j} -~ etlak 'pressure' ---+ tladen 'pressed'- {h j )~mnoho 'much, many' ~ mno2eni'mul-t/plying'- {gj}.-~2It is !not easy to find an example ofithis sprt of alternation, as g only oc-curs in loan words that do not use theold t~rpes of derivation.
In colloquialspeec h it would be perhaps possible tocreat~ the following form:pedaglog 'teacher' ---+ pedago2en( 'work-ing as a teacher'- {d j} -~zsladit 'to sweeten' ~ slazen('sweeten-ing'This sort of alternation is not pro-ductive any more-- in newer wordsrpalatalization applies:sladit.
'to tune up' --+ slad~n( ' tuningup'In some cases both variants are pos-sible, :or the different variants exist indifferent dialects--the ast (Moray/an)dialects tend to keep this phonolog-ical alternation, while the west (Bo-hemiah) dialects often abandoned it.- {t ie} ~ ~eplatit !to pay' ~ placen( 'paying'This alternation is also not productiveany more.

I concen-trated on dealing with the alternations that oc-cur in declension and regular conjugation, andthe most productive derivations.
The rest of al-ternations occurring in conjugation are treatedby inserting several verb stems in the lexicon.The list of alternations and other changes cov-ered by the rules:?
epenthesis?
palatalization in declension?
palatalization in conjugation?
palatalization in derivationnouns from masculinesof feminine?
palatalization in derivation of possessiveadjectives?
palatalization in derivation of adverbs?
palatalization i derivation of comparativesof adjectives and adverbs?
palatalization or assimilation in derivationof passive participles?
shortening of the vowel in suffixes -ik (inderivation of feminine noun from mascu-line) and-~v (in declension of possesive ad-jectives)For the CZech lexicon I used the softwarertools for two-level morphology developed at Xe-rox (Karttune.n and Beesley, 1992; Karttunen,1993).
The le:kical forms are created by attach-ing the proper ending/suffix to the base formin a separate:program.
To help the two-levelrules to find where they should operate, I alsomarked morpheme boundaries by special mark-ers.
These markers have two further functions:?
They bear the information about the lengthof ending i(or suffix and ending) of the baseform, i.e.
how many characters should beremoved before attaching the ending.?
They bear the information about the kindof alternation.Beside the markers for morpheme boundariesI also use markers for an epenthetic e. As I saidbefore, e is inserted before the last consonat of afinal consonant group, if the last consonant is asuffix, or if the consonant group is not phoneti-cally admissable.
However, as I do not generallydeal with derivation nor with the phonetics, Iam not able to recognize what is a suffix andwhat is phone~ically admissable.
That is why Ineed these special markers.Another auxiliary marker is used for mark-ing the suffix -~7~, that needs a special treatmentin derivation of feminine nouns and their poss-esive adjectives.
The long vowel/must be short-ened in the derivation, and the final k must bepalatalized even if the O-ending follows.
I needa special marker, as -ik- allows two realizationsfor both the sohnds in same contexts:Two realizations of id~edn~7~ 'clerk' ~ d~ednice 'she-clerk', butrybnzT~ 'pond' ~ rybnlce locative sgTwo realizations of kd?ednzT~ x d?ednic (genitive pl of the derivedfeminine)iIn the previous section, I described all pos-sible alternations concerning single consonants.When I work with the paradigms or with thederivations, it is necessary to specify the kindof the alternation for all consonants that canoccur at the boundary.
For this purpose I in-troduced four types of markers:"1P - -  1st palatalization for g, h and k, orthe only possible (or no) palatalization forother consonants.
I use this marker also forpalatalization c --~ 5 in vocative sg of theparadigm chlapec.
The final c is in fact apalatalized k, so there is even a linguisticmotivation for this.A2P - -  2nd palatalization for g, h and k, orthe only possible (or no) palatalization forother consonants.^A - -  Assimilation (or nothing).AN --- NO alternation.These markers are followed by a number thatdenotes how many characters of the base formshould be removed before attaching the end-ing/suffix.
Thus there are markers ~ 1P0, ^ 2P0,^1P1, etc.
The markers tarting with ^N onlydenote the length of the ending of the baseform--and instead of using ^ N0 I attach thesuffix/ending directly to the base form.
For-tunately, nearly all paradigms and derivationscause at most one type of alternation, so itis possible to use one marker for the wholeparadigm.The markers for an epenthetic e are ^ El (fore that should be deleted) and ^E2 (for e thatshould be inserted).
The marker for the suffix-zTc in derivations is ^ IK.Here are some examples of lexical items andthe rules that transduce them to the surfaceform:(1) doktorka  ^ 1Pl in^2P0~chThe base form is doktorka 'she-doctor'.
Themarker ^ IP1 denotes that the possible alter-nation at this morpheme boundary is (first)palatalization and that the length of the end-ing of the base form is 1 (it means that a mustbe removed from the word form and the possi-ble alternation concerns k).
The marker ~2P0means that the derived possessive adjective hasa O-ending and the possible alternation at thismorpheme boundary is palatalization.
If werewrite this string to a sequence of morphemeswe get the following string: doktork-in-~jch.
Thesound k in front of i is palatalized, so the cor-rect final form is doktordin~eh, which is genitiveplural of the possessive adjective derived fromthe word doktorka.Let us look now at the two-level rules thattransduce the lexical string to the surface string.We need four rules in this example: two fordeleting the markers, one for deleting the end-ing -a, and one for palatalization.
The rules fordeleting auxiliary markers are very simple, asthese markers hould be deleted in any context.The rules can be included in the definition ofthe alphabet of symbols:Alphabet7j IP0 : 0 7j 1P1:07.
'2P0:0 7,'2PI:0 7j2P2:0 7,'2P3:07jA2:0Z'NI:0 Z'N2:0 Z'N3:0 Z'N4:0Y,'EI:0 Y.
'E2:0 Y.
'IK:0This  notation means  that the auxiliary markersare always realized as zeros on the surface level.The rule for deleting the ending -c looks asfollows:"Deletion of the ending -a-"a:O <=> _ \[ Y,'NI: I ~ j iP I :  I ~,'2Pl:  \] ;_ t: \[ Z'N2: I Z'N4: \ ] ;The first line of the rule describes the contextof a one-letter nominal ending u, and the secondline describes the context of an infinitive suffixwith ending -at or -ovut.The rule for palatalization k -+ d looks as fol-lows:"First palatalization k -> ~"k:~ <=> _ (7,'IK:) \[ a: I ~: \] 7.
'iPi: i ;NonCeS: (End) 7.
'1PI: ~: ;The first line describes two possible cases: ei-ther the derivation of a possesive adjective froma feminine noun (doktorku--~ doktordin), or thederivation of a possesive adjective from a fem-inine noun derived from a masculine that endswith -~7~ ( ~ednzT~ ( d?ednice -+) d?ednidin).The second context describes a comparativeof an adjective, or a comparative of adverb de-rived from that adjective (ho?k~\] ~ ho?dejM,ho~deji).
The set NonCCS contains all characterexcept c, d and s and it is defined in a speciMsection.
This context condition is introduced,because the groups of consonants ck, dk and skhave different 1st palatalization.The label End denotes any character that canoccur in an ending and that is removed from thebase form.
(2) korek'2P0^ElemThe base form of this word form is korek 'cork';the marker ^ 2P0 means their the possible alter-nation is (second) palatalization and that thelength of ending of the base form is 0.
Themarker ^ El means that the base form containsan epenthetic e, and em is the ending of in-strumental singular.
The correct final form iskorkem.
The rule for deleting an (epenthetic) efollows:"Deletion of e"e:0 <=> Cons c: 7,'N2:;\[ YjIPI~" I 7j2P1: I Y,'NI: I 7jN2: \ ] ;Dons Cons: ( \ [Z ' IPO:  IZ '2PO: \ ] )  Z 'E i :  Vowel: ;t:0-\[ Z*2P2: I Z'N2: \];The first line describes the context for dele-tion of the suffix -ec in the derivation of the typev~dec 'scientist' --+ v~dkyn~ 'she-scientist'.The second context is the context of the end-ing -e or the suffix -ce.
This suffix must beremoved in the derivation of the type soudce'judge' ~ soudkyn~ 'she-judge'.
:The third context is the context of anepenthetic e that is present in the base formand must be removed from a form with a non-Oending.
The sets Cons and Vowel contain allconsonants and all vowels, respectively.The fourth line describes the context for dele-tion of the infinitive ending -et.The whole program contains 35 rules.
Someof the rules concern rather morphology thanphonology; namely the rules that remove end-ings or suffixes.
One rule is purely technical;it is one of the two rules for the alternationch ~ ~, as c and h must be treated separately4.6(though ch is considered one letter in Czechalphabet).
Six rules are forced by the Czechspelling rules (e.g.
rules for treating /d/ ,  / t /and /~/ in  various contexts, or a rule for rewrit-ing y ~ i after soft consonants).
18 rules dealbwith the actual phonological alternations andthey cover the whole productive phonologicalsystem of Czech language.
The lexicon usingthese rules was tested on a newspaper text con-taining 2,978,320 word forms, with the result ofmore than 96% analyzed forms.4 AcknowledgementsMy thanks to Ken Beesley, who taught me howto work with the Xerox tools, and to my fa-ther, Jan Skoumal, for fr~uitful discussions onthe draft of tNis paper.Re ferencesJan Hajji.
