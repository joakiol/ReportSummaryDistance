Centre VilleMontrdal, Qudbec, CanadaH3C 3J7AbstractThis paper discusses an approach to planning the contentof instructional texts.
The research is based on a corpusstudy of 15 French procedural texts ranging from step--by-step device manuals to general artistic procedures.
Theapproach taken starts from an AI task planner building atask representation, from which semantic arriers are se-lected.
The most appropriate RST relations to communi-cate these carriers are then chosen according to heuristicsdeveloped uring the corpus analysis.1 Introduct ionA standard problem in text generation is to determinewhat to include in the text and how to structure it.
Thegoal of this research is to study how the content of instruc-tional texts and their rhetorical structure can be selectedautomatically.
The approach taken starts from a taskrepresentation developed by an AI planner, from whicha set of semantic carriers, specifying the content of thetext, is selected.
Then the rhetorical relations that bestcommunicate these semantic arriers are selected.
Theapproach is based on a corpus analysis that determined:?
What semantic carriers are found in instructionaltexts, where they can be found in the task repre-sentation and when they are included in the text.
* What rhetorical relations are used to present he se-mantic carriers and when one is preferred over an-other.If these points are not dealt with, an instructional textgenerator may choose to say everything available in thetask representation, and may communicate it using al-ways the same rhetorical strategy.
For example, the taskof using the one touch record (OTR) feature of a VCR canbe represented as in figure 11 .
From this task representa-tion, the following unacceptable t xt may be produced:To use the 0TR feature, set the speed selector to "SP","SP" will light up; select channel 4; specify therecording time; emd press the TIMER button within 9seconds, the TIMER indicator w?11 light up.To set the speed selector to ?
*SP", press the SP/EPbutton.
The speed will change.To set channel 4, press the channel button.
The channelwill change.To specify the recording time, press the OTR button 3times.To press the OTR button 3 times, press it once, PM10:35; press it a second time, PM 11:05; press it athird time, PM 11:35.A more natural text would be~:The 0TR feature:Set the tape speed selector to "SP".
"SP" will (I)light up.Select channel 4, by pressing the channel button.
(2)Press the OTR button 3 times to specify the (3)recording time.When the button is pressed once, PM 10:35.
(4)When i t  is pressed twice, PM 11:05.
(5)When it is pressed 3 times, PM 11:35.
(6)Press the TIMER button within 9 seconds.
The (7)TIMER indicator will light up.Not all the knowledge of the task representation is in-troduced in the text.
For example, many parent-childrelations between operations are left unsaid.
In addition,the same type of knowledge is not always presented by thesame rhetorical relation.
For example the parent-child re-lation of the operations in sentence (2) is expressed by anenab iement  relation rather than a purpose  as in sen-tence (3).The paper first reviews previous work in instructionaltext planning.

Finally, preliminary results of a prototype systemare presented.2 Planning Instructional TextsThe goal of an instructional text is to describe the actionsto be performed to achieve a particular goal.
For thereader to understand/perform the procedure correctly,the instructional text must communicate the plan of theprocedure into the text.
In AI, planning techniques havebeen developed to construct such plans automatically.
Itthen becomes natural to consider an AI planner as a pre-liminary component to an instructional text generator.The output of an AI planner provides a fairly appropriatesource for generating instructional texts, as only specifictypes of information are found in these texts, and most ofthem can be found or derived from a task representation.Another important characteristic of instructional textsis that their rhetorical structure is rather stereotyped anduse a small set of relations \[12, 15\].
In addition, theserelations correspond very well to those defined in Mannand Thompson's RST \[7\].
This makes RST an attractivetool for studying this genre.From these two remarks, the planning of instructionaltexts is often seen as a two-stage process \[8, 1\]: a taskplanning stage, where the plan of the procedure is devel-oped, followed by a text planning stage, where the contentof the text is selected from the task representation 3, andthe rhetorical status of this knowledge is selected.3A task representat ion provides most  knowledge found in in-struct ional  texts ,  but  a model  of the reader and a domain  knowledgebase are also required.When a task representation is used as the source oftext planning, the resulting text is very much dependenton the representation's structure.
However, a task repre-sentation is not universal; several factors can influence itsdevelopment.
The lexical capacity of the language beingused may influence the conceptual representation of thetask.
Also, independently of the language being used, thesame task can be represented in various ways (whetherwith more or less detail, or with a different structure).However, whether we use one representation r another asthe basis for generation, the goal of our research is to gen-erate a text similar to "natural" ones so that readers caninterpret and possibly execute the procedure correctly.Even when human writers wl and w2 write "natural" in-structions for readers r l  and r2, they may base their writ-ing on different ask representations and may choose totransmit different information.
When reading the texts,r l  and r2 may build different ask representations fromone another and from wl and w2.
But if both texts areadequate, the readers will interpret he prescribed taskcorrectly.
No single ideal task representation exists fora procedure and no single ideal text describing it exists.Our goal is not to construct and use the one task repre-sentation that allows the generation system to reproducethe source text word for word, but to produce "possiblynatural" texts from a "possibly natural" task representa-tion.2.1 AI PlanningAn AI planner, or task planner, attempts to find a set ofoperations to achieve some task, or goal \[13\].
It tries totransform the current state of the world, where the goal547th International Generation Workshop ?
Kennebunkport, Maine ?
June 21-24, 1994is not satisfied to a final state where the goal is true.
Thetask planner takes as input a library of operation schemasand selects and orders a subset of these by constructingsome task representation.
Typically, AI planners are hi-erarchical and develop non-linear plans.
That is, they de-fine the plan by successive refinement, decomposing thecurrent plan to a lower, more detailed level of abstractionuntil primitive operations (which do not require furtherrefinement) are reached.
The resulting structure is a hi-erarchy of plans.
Non-linearity involves defining a partialorder on the operations.In the context of instruction generation, operationschemas can be built, as in traditional AI planning, out of:(1) the operation ame (eg.
use(0TR)), (2) its body: howthe operation can be sub-divided into simpler operations(eg.
set(speed_SP) A select(channel_4) A .
.
. )
,  (3)its preconditions: states that need to be true in orderto apply the operation (eg.
?n_vcr(cassette)); if thetask planner cannot solve a precondition, the conditionis passed on to the text planner to be included in thetext and solved by the agent, (4) and its postcondi-tions: states that become true or false after the oper-ation is executed.
Postconditions can be divided into:postconditions of success (if the operation is performedcorrectly, eg.
on(timer.light)) and postconditions offailure (if the operation is not performed correctly, eg.blink (error_light)).Note that we consider operations to be events whoseactor is the agent performing the procedure, and couldoccur now or in the near future.
Events whose actor isthe device being manipulated, some undefined actor, orwhich have occurred previously are considered states andmay be represented as postconditions or preconditions.For example, the actor of tu rn_on( t imer~ight )  is notthe agent of the procedure, but the device being manipu-lated.
This is thus not represented as an operation in theschemas but as a postcondition state of an agent opera-tion.2.2 Previous Work in Planning Instruc-tionsPrevious work on planning the contents of instructionaltexts include Dale's EPICURE \[1\] and Mellish and Evans'ssystem \[9\], which both start from the output of an AItask planner to select the text's content.
However thefirst system seems only applicable to a particular domain;while the other seems to lack linguistic motivation.In \[1\], all primitive operations of the task representa-tion are included in the text as a sequence of actions.Furthermore, only these primitive operations are includedin the text.
In EPICURE's domain (cooking recipes), 90to 100% of the content are action sequences \[15\].
Sincethe other knowledge available in the task representation(non-primitive operations, parent-child relations, .
.
. )
areusually not presented as action sequences, the strategyseems appropriate in this domain.
However, it cannotbe applied directly in most other domains where the pro-portion of action sequences i lower.
On the other hand,to explain a plan, \[9\] includes in the text all operationsand hierarchical relations available in the task represen-tation.
No result, condition, negative imperative \[3\], orother information found in naturally occurring texts areincluded.
Moreover, the rhetorical strategies used do notseem linguistically motivated.Our efforts are aimed at developing heuristics guidingthe selection of content and rhetorical status to produce"natural" instructions.
We have emphasized two typesof tasks.
According to the classification of \[5\], these are:operator tasks, ie.
procedures on a system or device to ac-complish a goal external to that system/device ( g. mow-ing the lawn); and maintenance/repair tasks, that is, spe-cific operations on a system/device ( g. repairing a taperecorder).3 The Corpus AnalysisIn order to generate "natural" texts, we first analyzed acorpus of 15 French instructional texts (.~ 13,300 words)from different writers, domains, and text types.Our view of instructional texts is rather larger thanin other NLP research.
For example, in \[15, 12, 2\] textsare restricted to execution-oriented instructions, wherethe reader is assumed to be the agent of the procedure.However, many texts that indicate how to perform a taskare explanation-oriented and thus do not assume thatthe reader will immediately or even ever execute the pro-cedure.
Our corpus thus ranges from step-by-step ro-cedures (also called procedural directives \[4\] and linearexplanations \[5\]), like device manuals to explanations-oriented texts like arts and crafts books.We performed an RST analysis only at the bottom levelof the textual structure, that is at the inter- and intra-clausal evels.
As reported in Vander Linden \[15\] and RSs-ner and Stede \[12\], instructional texts use only a subsetof RST relations.
The most common are tempora l  se-quence,  c i rcumstance/cond i t ion  (c-condition4), re-sult  (volitional and non volitional), purpose ,  enable-ment  and other non-procedural relations (attributes ofobjects, motivation .
.
. )
.4A c-condition combines RST's relations of circumstance andcondition.
It is what \[15\] and \[12\] call "precondition", but we preferto use this term in its AI planning definition.557th International Generation Workshop * Kennebunkport, Maine ?
June 21-24, 19943 .1  A Semant ic  Leve lWith the idea of using an AI task planner, and laterrhetorical relations, we first set out to see how the knowl-edge available from a task representation (call it taskknowledge) could directly determine rhetorical relations.In most cases, this is successful.
For example, opera-tion nodes in the task representation are mostly presentedby action sequences, parent operation odes by purposerelations, postconditions by results .
.
.
However in manycases, the same type of task knowledge is communicatedthrough different relations.For example, parent-child relations can be presented inthe text by a purpose related to an action.
In this casethe relation is seen bottom-up and explains why the childoperation should be performed, as in:(1) Revissez l'6crou-capuchon sur la lyre pour ne pas le per-dre .
(Screw the screw-cap on the lamp shade holder so thatyou do not lose itfi)A parent-child relation can also be presented by an en-ablement related to an action.
In that case, the relationis seen top-down and explains how the parent operationshould be performed, as in:(2) R~gler la ceinture n la tirant par la languette:(Adjust the belt by pulling it by the flap.
)Another example involves preconditions which can be pre-sented by a purpose relation or a c-condition, as in:(3) a. Pour vous aider, poussez fermement le flanc du pneuavec votre pied.
(To help you, firmly press the side of the tire withyour foot.)b.
Si la victime est debout, placez-vous derriere lle.
(I\] the victim is standing, place yourself behind him.
)As shown from these examples, the task knowledge doesnot uniquely determine the rhetorical relation used.
Theopposite is also true.
In both examples (1) and (3a), apurpose relation is used, but in (1), it indicates a hierar-chical relation and in (3a) it indicates a precondition onthe "press" operation.In order to map the task knowledge to the appropriaterhetorical structure, we have introduced an intermediatesemantic level.
This level classifies task knowledge intosemantic carriers according to functional criteria (themandatory/optional nature of operations, the executiontime, the influence of an operation on the interpretationof the procedure .
.
. )
.
Semantic arriers help determinewhat task knowledge is introduced in the text and whatrhetorical relation should be used.For example, in (1), the parent-child relation carries asense causality because it indicates that the "screwing"5 All Eng l i sh  t rans la t ions  are  ours .operation will cause the agent not to lose the screw-cap.The parent operation (not losing the screw-cap) does notinfluence how the child operation should be executed butrather justifies it.
For this kind of semantic carrier, apurpose relation is most frequently used.
In (2) however,the execution of the "pull" operation is influenced by the"adjust" goal; it carries a sense of guidance on how theexecution should be performed.
In this particular case,an enablement relation was selected.
In (3a), the precon-dition indicates an option that the agent will probably se-lect, this explains why a purpose relation is used.
Finally,in (3b), the precondition indicates a material condition;this semantic Carrier is mostly presented by a c-conditionrelation.3 .2  Some Resu l tsFigure 2 shows the correspondence between the taskknowledge, the semantic arriers they can bring about,and the rhetorical relations used to present hem.
Thesesemantic arriers are by no means the only way to inter-pret the information communicated in instructional texts(see for example \[10, 3\]), and only account for proceduraltype information.
They are based on our interpretationof our corpus.The heuristics to introduce certain semantic carriersrely heavily on the notion of basic-level operations intro-duced by Rosch \[11\] and Pollack \[10\].
Basic-level opera-tions are those operations that people seem to rememberand are able to represent mentally most easily.
In thetexts, they turn out to be detailed enough to be descrip-tive, but general enough to be useful.
In her work, \[11\]found considerable agreement among people on the kindsof units of events that are remembered.
For example,when asked to recall events that occurred in the morning,subjects remembered operations like brushing their teeth,taking a shower, but no one mentioned smaller units likesqueezing the toothpaste tube .
.
.
or larger units like "do-ing the morning chores".
It was hypothesized then thatpeople have a more accessible memory representation forbasic-level operations, than for any other type of event.This hypothesis eems appropriate in instructional texts:basic-level operations are included in the text as the writ-ers have a memory representation for them and promotethe reader's recall, for they can easily build a memoryrepresentation f the procedure.
Then, depending on thelevel of knowledge of the reader, more or less detailedoperations are given.
Basic-level operations are a rathersubjective notion and depend heavily on factors like thecommunicative goal, the discourse domain .
.
.Only the most common semantic arriers (making upmore than 80% of the texts) are discussed here.

This semantic arrier is the most frequentin all types of instructions.
In our corpus, it counts 748occurrences and make up 80% (in step-by-step instruc-tions) to 30% (in explanations-oriented instructions) ofthe text.Sequential operations are found as operation ames inthe task representation.
According to our analysis, threetypes of operations hould be included in the text:?
All basic-level operations;?
All children operations of basic-level operation, thathave different postconditions from their siblings, andwhose postconditions will be included in the text as acausality (see below).?
All children operations of basic-level operation thatthe reader does not know how to perform.
In this case, asub-procedure is introduced.Sequential operations are sometimes presented by C-6For easy reference, they are preceded by a * in figure 2.
In thetext, content selectlon heuristics are preceded by a ?
and rhetoricalseIectlon heuristics by a o.condition 7 (1% of the time), but almost always by a se-quence of action clauses (99%).o A c-condition is used if a result, a negative imperative\[3\] or an action sequence will follow the operation in thetext, and the operation is durative or follows case 2 above(see sentences 4, 5 and 6 of the VCR text).o Otherwise, the operation is presented by a temporalsequence of actions.Mater ia l  Cond i t ions  are preconditions on the stateof the environment that the task planner is not able toverify.?
All such preconditions are included in the text tolet the agent decide for himself whether the next line ofoperations hould be performed.Out of 158 material conditions of the corpus, only 1%are presented by an action sequence, 3% by a purpose,6% by a result and 90% by a c-condition.To determine the rhetorical status of material condi-tions we believe that:o As \[15\] found, material conditions that specify en-surative actions (that the agent can make sure are trueor do something so that they become true) are presentedby action sequences.

This information is found in the task repre-sentation in the hierarchical relation between operations.Previous work on deciding whether or not to includehierarchical relation prescribed the inclusion of all \[8\], orno relation \[1\].
According to our analysis, a guidance isgenerally introduced when:?
The execution of a basic-level operation depends onthe execution of its parent operation (eg.
for a stoppingcondition, a method to follow .
.
.
).
(8) Vous devez les d@vissez en tournant dans le sens des aigu-illes d'une rnontre.You must unscrew them by turning clockwise.?
A basic-level operation requires precisions on how toexecute it (eg, the reader does not know all steps, hesitatebetween 2 methods .
.
. )
.
In that case, the most impor-tant and discriminating sub-operation(s) is given.
Forexample,(9) Introduisez un crayon dans la conduite en provenance dela pompe ?
essence afin dYviter tout gcoulement.Insert a pencil in the pipe from the gas pump in order toprevent any leakage.Of the 120 guidances in our corpus, 72% are presentedby an enablement and 28% by a purpose.o A purpose relation is always used if more than onesub-operation is given; if there is only one, both an en-ablement and a purpose may be used.o If the sub-operation specifies the use of a particularinstrument or a particular way of doing an operation, anenablement is generally used (see example (8)).o Otherwise, a purpose is generally used as in example(9).Causa l i t ies  specify what the execution of an operationcauses to the current state of the world.
That  is, whatbecomes true and what is no longer true in the world.Causalities are found in an operation's post-conditionsand in its parent operation.
Indeed, the effect of anywell executed operation is the achievement of its goal (theparent operation) and its postcondition.?
A causality is included in the text if the reader isnot aware of the causal link between an operation and apostcondition or?
does not understand why a basic-level operationshould be executed.Causalities are always brought about by an agent oper-ation and can specify an operation from the device (somereaction) or from the agent.
Of the 136 causalities of thecorpus, 35% are presented by a purpose relation and 65%by a result.o Causalities pecifying a device's reaction are alwayscommunicated through a result relation, as in:(10) Presser "4", et le canal $ sera selectionnd ans les 2 sec-ondes.Press "4", and channel ~ will be selected within P seconds.Causalities pecifying an agent operation can be com-municated through a purpose or a result relation.
In thiscase, the causality justifies why a series of operations thatmay seem strange should be performed.
They are used tosatisfy the reader's curiosity and, unlike guidances do notinfluence the performance of the operations.
Compare,for example, sentence (8) above with:(11) Pour protdger les bornes contre la tension, nouez les ex-tr@mit@s @par@es du cordon.To protect the terminals against electric tension, tie theextremities of the wire away from each other.o If the causality specifies an operation that the agentwishes to perform, the causality is presented by a purpose.o If the causality indicates an operation that the agentdoes not know needs to be perform, the causality is pre-sented by a result relation.4 The  SPIN SystemThe results of the corpus analysis have been implementedin the spin s prototype.
SPIN is involved in all levels oftext generation: strategic, tactical, and motor \[17\] levels.Generation is performed linearly with the emphasis putSSyst~me de Planification d'INstructions587th International Generation Workshop ?
Kennebunkport, Maine ?
June 21-24, 1994on the strategic stage.
SPIN builds a task representationfrom a top level goal and an initial description of theworld using a hierarchical non-linear planning technique.The resulting hierarchy of plans is traversed breath-firstby the text planner to select he semantic arriers.
Then,the most appropriate local rhetorical relations are chosen.At the linguistic realization level, the actual grammaticalform and position of the relations are selected based onthe results of \[15\] adapted to French 9.Figure 3 shores an output of SPIN.
It indicates how touse the one touch recording (OTR) feature of a VCR (itsEnglish translation was given in section 1).
Let us sketchthe planning of this text.From a library of operation schemas, SPIN developsthe task representation of figure 1.
Note that figure 1only includes the operation ames and the postconditions,whereas the actual plan representation includes the entireoperation schemas.In this task, basic-level operations are considered tobe: set  any speed, se lec t  any channel, and press  anybutton.The text planner initially selects the top-level goal asthe title of the ttxt.
Let us deal with postconditions first:from the heuristics of section 3.2, recall that causalitiesfrom postconditions are included if the reader does notexpect hem.
After consulting the model of the reader t?,SPIN rules out the postconditions changed(speed) andchanged(channel)  already expected by the reader, anddecides to include all other postconditions as causalities,using a result relation.Because set  (speed_SP) is a basic-level operation, SPINselects it as a sequential operation.
Because it does notsatisfy the special case for using c-conditions, it is pre-sented by an action sequence (sentence 2).
The readerknows how to perform the operation so its child opera-tion is not given, qSet (channel_4) is a basic-level op-eration, but the reader is assumed to know two meth-ods of executing it.
A guidance with the sub-operationpress (channe l .but ton)  is therefore included.
Becausethe operation specifies a particular instrument to be used,SPIN chooses an enablement to communicate this guid-ance (sentence 3).
Spec i fy ( t ime)  is not considered abasic-level operation, but press(0TR_button, 3_times)is.
The reader may wonder why this last operation shouldbe done (according to his model, he does not know thatthis operation is done to specify the time), so a causal-9The positions of the rhetorical relations in both languages seemfairly similar, but the grammatical realization often differs.
In ad-dition, because we consider explanation-oriented instructions, thevariety of grammatical forms is larger.l?The model of the reader is a library of operation schemas rep-resenting the reader's knowledge.
This library is allowed to be in-consistent with the task planner's and is corrected and updateddynamically as the text is produced.La touche OTR (1)R4glez le s41ecteur de v i tesse  de bande (2)sur ~(SP''S~lectionnez le canal 4, en appuyant la (3)touche de canal.Appuyez sur la touche 0TR 3 fois pour (4)specifier l'heure d'enregistrement.Lorsque la touche est enfonc4e 1 fois, PM (5)10:35.Lorsqu'elle est enfonc~e 2 fois, PM 11:05.

(7)Appuyez sur la touche TIMER dans un d~lai (8)de 9 secondes.Figure 3: SPIN output: the VCR textity with spec i fy ( t ime)  is included in the text.
Thereader knows this parent operation should be performed,therefore the causality is presented by a purpose rela-tion (sentence 4).
The 3 children of press  (0TR_bueton,3_times) are also included in the text as operation se-quences because they have different postconditions in-cluded in the text.
For this reason, they are pre-sented by c-conditions in sentences 5, 6 and 7.
Finally,p ress ( t imer_but ton)  is a basic-level operation, it isthus included as a sequential operation and communi-cated through an action sequence.SPIN puts an emphasis on the planning stage, thusmany aspects of the linguistic realization are left uncon-sidered.
However, to avoid generating heavy and unnatu-ral descriptions, SPIN can generate some anaphora (see forexample the referring expression la touche of sentence 5and the pronouns elle of sentences 6 and 7).
This featureis especially useful in system/device-oriented instructionswhere the same objects are often used.
This was done byimplementing a subset of Tutin's study \[14, 6\].5 Conc lus ionThis research is aimed at planning instructional textsfrom the output of an AI planner.
The approach is basedon a corpus study of a wide range of operator and re-pair/maintenance domains.
It is based on a two stageprocess: a task planning stage, and a text planning stage.Text planning is not performed constructively throughRST schemas.
Rather, from the task representation a setof semantic arriers are selected, then from these, appro-priate RST relations are selected.Several aspects of instructional texts have been leftaside.
Repetitions, for example, do not occur frequently597th International Generation Workshop * Kennebunkport, Maine * June 21-24, 1994and so have not been fully considered.
Although itera-tive operations in a task representation should be expliciton their stopping condition and their scope, pragmaticknowledge allows "natural texts" to be less specific.
Con-sider, for example, instructions for using a shampoo: Wethair, lather, rinse and repeat.The current area of research involves analyzing how thecommunicative goal of the instructional text influencesthe content selection heuristics.
For the moment, we arespecifically looking at texts with different degrees of exe-cution incentive.
Texts designed for the immediate xecu-tion of the procedure seem to use different heuristics forintroducing semantic arriers than explanation-orientedinstructions.
For example, only external causalities areincluded in step-by-step instructions; while both externaland internal causalities are included in explanation in-struction texts.
We presume that the execution incentivedoes not influence the choice of RST relations, althougha full investigation should be performed.AcknowledgmentsMany thanks to all members of the SCRIPTUM researchteam, and especially to Richard Kittredge and MassimoFasciano.
