FRENCH ORDER WITHOUT ORDER*Gabriel G. B~Universit6 Blaise Pascal - Clermont II, Formation Doctorale Linguistique t Informatique34 Ave. Carnot, 63037 Clermont-Ferrand Cedex, FRANCEClaire GardentUniversit6 Blaise Pascal -Clermont II and University of Edinburgh, Centre for Cognitive Science,2 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh EH89LW, SCOTLAND, UKABSTRACTTo account for the semi-free word order of French,Unification Categorial Grammar is extended in twoways.
First, verbal valencies are contained in a setrather than in a list.
Second, type-raised NP's aredescribed as two-sided functors.
The new frameworkdoes not overgenerate i.
., it accepts all and only thesentences which are grammatical.
This follows partlyfrom the elimination of false lexical ambiguities - i.e.,ambiguities introduced inorder to account for all thepossible positions a word can be in within a sentence -and partly from a system of features constraining thepossible combinations.INTRODUCTIONIn the version of categorial grammar (henceforth,CG) developed by Bar-Hillel (Bar-Hillel 1953), cate-gories encode both constituency and linear prece-dence.
Linear precedence is encoded by (a) orderingvalencies in a list and (b) using directional slashesindicating whether the argument is to be found to theleft or to the right of the functor.A similar approach isadopted in Unification Cate-gorial Grammar (UCG) (Zeevat, Klein and Calder1987) as regards word order whereby the directionalslash is replaced by a binary Order feature with valuepre orpost.
Thus, S/NPLNP in normal CG lranslates asS/NP:predNP:post in UCG, wherepre indicates that hefunctor must precede the argument and post that itshould follow it.Our work on French syntax supports the claim thatthe complicated pattern of French linearity phenomenacan be treated in a framework closely related to UCGbut which departs from it in two ways.
First, there is norigid assignment ofan order value (pre orpost) to verbvalencies.
Second, following (Gunji 1986) verbal va-lencies are viewed as forming aset rather than a list.
As* The word reported here was tan'led out as part of ESPRITProject 393 ACORD,'q'he Construction a d Interrogation fKnowledge Bases using Natural Language Text and Gra-pities".a result, the syntactic behaviour of constituents idissociated from surface ordering.
Constraints onword order are described by a system of features asadvocated inCOszkoreit 1987) and (Karttunen 1986).1.
UCGIn UCG, the phonological, categorial, semantic andorder information associated with a word is containedin a single grammar structure called a sign.
This can berepresented asfollows.
(1) UCG signPhonology:Categnry:Semantics:Orderor equivalentlyPhonology:Category:Semantics:Orderwhere colons separate the different fields of the sign.We need not concern ourselves here with the Se-mantics and the Phonology fields of the sign.
Moreinteresting for our purpose are the Category and theOrder attributes.
Following the categorial tradition,categories can be basic or complex.
Basic categoriesare of the form HeadAFeatures where Head is one ofthe atomic symbols n(oun), np or s(entence) and Fea-tures is a list of feature values.
Complex categories areof the form C/Sign, where C is either atomic or com-plex and Sign is a sign, so that departing from traditio-nalCG's,a functorplaces constraints on the whole signof the argument rather than on its syntactic ategoryonly.
The part of a complex category which omits theHead'Weatures information constitutes the activepartof the sign.
The f'trst accessible sign in the active partis called the active sign, the idea being that e.g.
verbvalencies are ordered in a list so that each time avalency is consumed, the next sign in the active part be-comes the new active sign.
The Order attribute placesconstraints on the combination rule that may apply toa functor: pre on an argument sign Y indicates that hefunctor X/Y must precede the argument, while postindicates that the functor must follow the argument.- 249-Using terms and term unification, the forward version 1of functional pplication can then be stated as follows.

In effect,the rule requires that he active part of the functor signterm unifies with the argument sign.
The Result is asign identical to the functor sign, but where the com-plex category isstripped from its active part and wherevariables shared by the active part of the functor and therest of the functor sign may have become ground as aresult of the active part unifying with the argument.The resulting phonology consists of the phonology ofthe functor followed by the phonology of the argument.An illustrative combination is given in (3) below forthe sentence J an marche.

LINGUISTIC OBSERVATIONSWord order in French is characterised bythree mainfacts.
First, the positioning - left or right- of a particularargument with respect to the verb is relatively free.
Ast.
Baekward application is just the symmetric of(2) where theargument precedes the funetor endpre becomes post.illustrated in (4), the subject can appear to the left (4a)or to the right (4b,c) of the verb, or between theauxiliary and the verb (4d), depending on the morpho-logical class of the NP and on the type of the sentence(declarative, subject-auxiliary inversion, wh-question,etc).
(4) (a) Jacques aime Marie.CO) Alme-t-il Marie ?
(c) Quel livre aime Jacques ?
(d) A-t-il aim6 Marie ?All other arguments can also appear to the left or tothe right of the verb under similar conditions.
Forexample, a lexical non-nominative NP can never be tothe left of the verb, but critics and wh-constituents can.
(5) (a) *Marie aregard~e Jacques ?
(with Marie = Obj)Co) QueUe revue a regard~e Jacques ?
(with Quelle revue = Obj)(c) Jacques l'a regardteSecond, there seems to be no clear egularities go-verning the relative ordering of a sequence of argu-ments.
That is, assuming that only adjacent consti-tuents may combine and taking the combinations left-to-right, the combination pattern varies as indicatedbelow of each example in (6).
Here again, the permis-sible distributions are influenced by factors uch as themorphological c ass of the constituents and the verbmood.
(6) (a) Pierre donne h Marie un livre.\[Subj,IObj,Obj\]Co) Pierre donne un livre h Marie.\[Subj,Obj,IObj\](c) Le lui donne-t-il ?\[Obj,IObj,Subj\](d) Se le donne-t-il ?\[IObj,Obj,Subj\]Third, coocurrence r strictions hold between cons-tituents.
For example, clitics constrain the positioningand the class of other arguments as illustrated in (7) 2(7) (a) Pierre le lui donne.Co) Pierre lui en donne.
(c) Pierre lui donne un livre.
(d) *Pierre lui le donne.
(e) *Pierre lui y donne.Since the ordering and the positioning of verbarguments inFrench are very flexible, the rigid orde-In italics : the word whose coocurrence r striction isviolated (starred sentences) or obeyed (non-starred senten-ces).
For instance, (7d) is starred because lu/may not befollowed by le.- 250-ring forced by the UCG active list and the fixedpositioning resulting from the Order attribute are ra-ther inadequate.
On the other hand, word order inFrench is not free either.
Rather it seems to be governedby conditional ordering statements such as:(8) IF (a) the verb has an object valency, andCo) the object NP is a wh-constituent, and(c) the verbal constituent is the simple inflectedverb, and(d) the clitic t-il/elle has not been incorporatedTHEN the object can be placed to the left or to theright of the verb.If say, (8d) is not fulfilled, the wh-NP can be placedonly to the left, witness: *Jacques a-t-il regard~ quellerevue ?, and mutatis mutandis for the other conditions.More generally, five elements can be isolated whoseinteraction determine whether or not a given argumentcan occupy a given position in the sentence.
(9) (a) Position - left or right - with regard to theverb,Co) Verbal form and sentence type,(c) Morphological class (lexical, wh-consti-tuent or clitic) of the previous constituenthaving concatenated to the left or to the rightof the verb,(d) Morphological class of the current consti-tuent (lexical, wh-constituent or clitic),(e) Case.We claim that it is possible to extend UCG in orderto express the above conditioning variables.
The resul-ling grammar can account for the preceding linguisticfacts without resorting either to lexical ambiguity or tojump rules 3.3.
EXTENSIONS TO UCGTo account for the facts presented in section 2,UCG has been modified in two ways.
Firstly, the activepart ofaverb category isrepresented as a set rather thana list.
Secondly, a feature system is introduced whichembodies the interactions of the different elementsconditioning word order as described in (9) above.3.1 SIGN STRUCTURE AND COMBINATIONRULE : FROM AN ACTIVE LIST TO ANACTIVE SET.To accomodate our analysis, the sign structure andthe combination rule had to be slightly modified.
In theFrench Grammar (FG), a sign is as follows.XA jump rule as used in (Baschung etal.
1986), is of the formX/Y, Y/'Z => X/'Z.
(10)  French Grammar SignPhonology: Category: Features: Semantics: Optionality: OrderSemantics and Phonology are as in UCG.
Optiona-lity indicates whether the argument is optional orobligatory 4.
The Category attribute differs from UCGin that (i) there are no Features associated with theHead and (ii) the active part of a verb is viewed as a setrather than as a list.The Features attribute is a list of features.
In thispaper, only those relevant o order constraints arementioned.
They are: case, verb mood, morphologicalclass of NP's (i.e., lexical, clitic or wh-constituent)and last concatenation to the left (Lastlefl) or to theright (Lastright).
The latter features indicate the mor-phological status of the last concatened functorand areupdated by the combination rule (cf.
(13)).
For ins-tance, the sign associated with Jean lui a donnd un livrewill have lex as values for Lastlefl and Lastrightwhereas lui a donn~ un livre has lui and lex respective-ly.
The Features attribute can be represented as in (11 )below, where the same feature may occupy adifferentposition in the feature list of different linguistic units,e.g., feature list of verb valencies and feature list of NPsigns.
(11) The Features attributeFor valencies (active sign of NP's and verbs) :\[Case, Lastleft, Lastright\]For verb signs :\[Mclass, Lastleft, Lastright, Vmood\]As illustrated in (12), the Order attribute has twoparts, one for when the functor combines forward, theother for when it combines backward.
(12) The Order attributeCdts =~ pre ~ Resfeat,Cdts =~ post =~ Resfeat,where Cdts and Resfeat are lists of feature valueswhose order and content are independent from those ofthe Features attribute.
The intuition behind this is thatfunctors (i.e., type-raised NP's) are two-sided i.e., theycan combine to the left and to the right but underdifferent conditions and with different results.
Thefeatures in Cdts place constraints on the features of theargument while the features in Resfeat are inherited bythe resulting sign.
These effects are obtained by unifi-4.
In the rest of this paper, the Semantics and the Optionalityattributes will be omitted since they have no role to play in ourtreatment of word order while Phonology will only be repre-sented when relevant.- 251  -cation of shared variables in the rules of combination.Omitting Semantics and Optionality attributes, theforward combination rule is as follows.
(13) Forward Combination s (FC)FunctorPhonologyF:~ CategoryF / PhonologyA:CategoryA:\[MClassA .... \]: (\[Lastleft,Vmood\] ~pre~ \[Vmood2\],_3:\[MClassF...\].

The notion of combinationrelies on the idea that the active part of a verb is a setrather than a list.
More precisely, given a type-raisedNP NP1 with category C/(C/NP.)
where NP i is avalency sign, and a verb V1 with category slActSetwhere ActSet is a set of valency signs, NP1 combineswith V1 to yield V2 iff NPi unifies with some NP-valen-cy sign in the active set ActSet of the verb.
V2 isidentical to V1 except hat the unifying NP i valencysign has been removed from the active set and thatsome features inV1 will have been instantiated bytherule.
Forward combination further requires (ii) that hetwo features in the condition list to pre unify with theLastlefl and Vmood features of the argument (the fea-tures conditioning post are ignored since they are rele-vant only when the functor combines backwards), and(iii) that he features of the resulting sign be as speci-fied.
Note in particular that he MClass of the resultingsign is the MClass of the argument, hat Lastrightwhich indicates the morphological class ofthelast ignto have combined with the verb from theright, istrans-mitted from the argument, and thatLastlefl isassignedas value the MClass of the functor.
Features of the re-suiting sign which are conditional on the combinationorder ate inherited from the Resfeat field.
This perco-x In this figure, numbers inside square denote the followingattribute.
For instance, \[\] denotes CategoryA'.lation of features by rule is crucial to our treatment ofword order.
It is illustrated by (14) below where thesign S 1 associated with the clitic le combines with thesign for $2 regarde to yield a new sign $3 le regarde.

When it combines by BC,the conditions onpost ensure that he argument has notcombined with anything on its right and that it hasmood imperative.
In this way, all sentences in (15) areparsed appropriately.
(15) (a) I1 le hi  donne.Co) *II lui le donne.
(c) Donne le lui.
(d) *Donne lui le.The backward combination rule (BC) functionslike FC except for two things.
First, the argument mustbe to the left of the functor and second, the conditionfield considered is that ofpost rather than ofpre.
Thereis also a deletion rule to eliminate optional valencies.No additional rule is needed.3.2 EXPRESSING THE VARIABLES UNDER-LYING WORD ORDER CONSTRAINTSIn our grammar, there are nopost andpre primitivevalues associated with specific verb valencies.
Instead,features interact with combination rules to enforce the- 252  -constraints on word order described in (9).
(9a) iscaptured in the two-sided order field.
(9b - verb mood)and (9c- morphological c ass of preceding concatena-ting functor) are accounted for in that in a functor, thefeatures conditioning order include the verb mood andthe last concatenation attribute.
(9d) is accounted for in that conditions which areinvariant for a particular class of constituent (clitic,wh-constituent, lexical NP) are expressed inthe Orderfield of these constituents.
For example, wh-consti-tuents reject hrough their conditions topre a wh-valuefor the Lastlefl feature of the argument and an inv16value in their condition to post.
As a result, the follo-wing sentences are parsed appropriately.
(16) (a) *A qui qui a ttltphon6 ?Co) *A-t-il t~ltphon6 a qui ?
(c) A qui a-t-il ttltphon6 ?
(d) I1 a ttltphone a qui ?Conditions which vary depending on the class ofthe concatenating constituent are expressed in theFeatures attribute of the verb valencies.
This allows usto express constraints on the position of a given type ofNP (lex, wh or clitic) relative to the valency it consu-mes.
For instance,a lexical NPcan be subject or object.If it is subject and it is to the left of the verb, it cannotbe immediately followed by a wh-constituent.
If it issubject and it is placed to the right of the verb, it mustbe immediately adjacent to it.
These constraints can bestated using unification along to the following lines.A verb valency is of the form(17) (np:\[... X,Y ...\]:Ord)where X and Y are either the anonymous variable or aconstant.
They state constraints, among others, onpossible values ofLastlefl andLastright features of theverb.
Recall that a valency is a sign which is a memberof a set in the Category attribute of a verbal sign.The active sign of a type raised NP is of the form:(18) C/(np:\[... V1, V2...\]:__):\[vb I_\]:(\[V1 ...\] => pre => Z, \[V2...\] => post => W)By rule, V1 and V2 in the Category attribute of (18)must unify with X and Y, respectively, in the verbvalency (17).
Being shared variables, they transmit theinformation to the Conditions on concatenation byFC(pre) and BC (post), respectively.Furthermore, V1 and V2 in the Ord attribute of thefunctor must unify, by rule, with some specified featu-res in the verb Features attribute represented in (19).The value/nvl for the Lastlefl feature of a verb resulm froma backward combination of the nominative litic -t-il withthis verb.
(19) \[vb, Lasleft, Lastright .. .
.
\]The flow of information between (17), (18) and(19) is represented graphically in (20), where (20a),(20b) and (20c) correspond to (17), (18) and (19) res-pectively.
(20a) and (20c), which express the Categoryand theFeatures attibutes of the same verbal sign, havebeen dissociated for the sake of clarity.

But aconcatenation byBC will fail(i does not unify with lex).Thus examples in (22) are correctly recognised (seeAppendix).

IMPLEMENTATIONThe UCG formalism and the corresponding com-putational environment were developped atthe Centrefor Cognitive Science, University of Edinburgh by(Calderetal.
1986).
They include facilities for definingtemplates and path-equations a  in PATR-2 and a shift-reduce parser.
The extensions to the original frame-work have been implemented atthe Universit6 Blaise- 253 -Pascal, Formation Doctorale Linguistique et Informa-tique, Clermont-Ferrand (France).
The system runs ona Sun and has been extensively tested.5.
COVERAGE AND DISCUSSIONThe current grammar ccounts for the core local i-nearity phenomena of French i.e., auxiliary and cliticorder, clitic placement in simple and in complex verbphrases, clitic doubling and interrogative inversions.Unbounded dependencies are catered for without re-sorting either to threading COCG), functional uncer-tainty (Karttunen) or functional composition (Combi-natory Categorial Grammar, Steedman 1986).
Instead,the issue is dealt with at the lexical level by introducingan embedding valency on matrix verbs.
Finally, nonlocal order constraints such as constraints on the distri-bution of negative particles and the requirement for awh-constituent to be placed to the left of the verb whena lexical subject is placed to the right (see example(22d)) can also be handled.Thus, it appears that insights from phrase structureand categorial grammar can be fruitfully put togetherin a lexical framework.
Following GPSG, our forma-lism does not associate verb valencies with any intrin-sic order.
An interesting difference however isthat LPstatements are not used either.
This is important sincein French, clitic ordering (B~s 1988) shows that orderconstraints may hold between items belonging to dif-ferent local trees.
Another difference with GPSG is thatas in UCG, no explicit statement offeature instantia-tion principles i required: the feature flow of informa-tion is ensured by the concatenation rules.
Last but notleast, it is worth underlining that our approach (1)keeps the number of combination rules down to 2 (plusa unary deletion rule) and (2) eliminates unjustifiedlexical ambiguity i.e., ambiguity not related to catego-rial or semantic nformation on the other hand.Though there are -or so we argue - good linguisticreasons for representing verb valencies as a set ratherthan as a list, it is only fair to stress that this rapidlyleads to computational innefficiency while parsing.Typically, given 3 adjacent signs NP 1 V NP2 there willbe two ways of combining each NP with the verb andthus two parses.
In a more complex sentence, so-called"spurious ambiguities" - i.e., analyses which yieldexactly the same sign - multiply very quickly.
