A FORMAL REPRESERTATION OF PROPOSITIONS AND T~PORAL ADVERBIALSJttrgen KunzeZentralinswitut fGr Sprachwissenschaft derAkademie der Wissenschaften der DDRPrenzlauer Promenade 149-152Berlin, DDR-1100ABSTRACTThe topic of the paper is the intro-duction of a formalism that permits ahomogeneous representation of definitetemporal adverbials, temporal quanti-fications (as frequency and duration),temporal conJ~ctions and tenses, andof their combinations with propositions.This unified representation renders itpossible to show how these componentsrefer to each other and interact inc reat i~ temporal meanings.
The formalrepresentation is 0ased on the notions"phase-set" and "phase-operator", and itinvolves an interval logic.
Furthermorelogical coz~uections are used, but the(always troublesome) logical quantifica-tions may be avoided.
The expressionsare rather near to lingaistic struc-tures, which facilitates the link totext analysis.
Some emprical confir-mations are outlined.q.
THE GENERAL FRAMEThis paper presents some resultsthat have been obtained in the fieldof time and tense-phenomena (K~Luze 1987).In connection with this some links totext analysis, knowledge representationand q~erence mechanisms have beentaken into accoumt.The formalism presented here differsfrom what is under label of temporallogic on the market (e. g. Prior (1967),Aqviet/Guenthner (1978).
Our main in-tention is to establish a calculus thatis rather near to linguistic structureson one side (for text analysis) and toinference mechanisms on the otherside.The whole formalism has integratingfeatures, i. e. the following compo-nents are represented by the same for-mal means in a way, that it becomeseasy and effective to refer the differ-ent components to each other:- The propositions and their validitywith respect to time;- Definite temporal adverbials (nex~wee k , ever~ Tuesda2);- Definite temporal qu~uti?ications asfrequency (three times) and duration(three hours), comparislon of fre-quencies, durations etc.
;- Temporal conj~ctlons;- Tenses and their different meanings.The unified representation rendersit possible to observe how the compo-nents interact in creating temporalmeanings and relations.
Some detailshave to be left out here, e. g. thenotion "determined time" and the axio-matic basis of the calculus.- 197 -2.
PHASE-SETS AND PROPOSITIONSA phase p is an interval (either un-bounded or a span or a moment) which atruth value (denoted by q(p)) is as-signed to:q(p) = T : p is considered as an affir-mative phase.q(p) ?
F : p is considered as a denyingphase.The intervals are subsets of the timeaxis U (and never empty!)
.A phase-set P is a pair tP',q3,where Pa is a set of intervals, and q(the evalnation function) assigns atruth value to each pe Pa. P has to ful-fil the following consistency demand:(A) For all p , ,p"aP"  holds:If p'n p" @ ~, then q(p') ?
q(P").A phase-set P is called complete, iffthe union of all phases of P covers U.Propositions R are replaced by com-plete phase-sets that express the"structured" validity of R on the timeaxis U.
Such a phase-set, denoted by(R>, has to  be understood as a possibletemporal perspective of R. There arepropositions that differ from eachother in this perspective only: Por(I) John sleeps in the dinin~ room~one has several such perspectives: Heis sleeping there, he sleeps there be-cause the bedroom is painted (for somedays), he sleeps always there.
SO thephases of (R> are quite different, evenwith clear syntactic consequences forthe underlying verb, The local adver-bial may not be omitted in the secondand th i rd  easel ~I sk ip  here  complete ly  the fo l low ingproblems:- A more sophisticated application ofnested phase-sets for the representa-tion of discontinuous phases in (R>;- the motivation of phases (e. g. accord-ing to Vendler (1967)) and their ad-equacy.3.
PHASE-0PERATORSA phase-operator is a mapping withphase-sets as arguments and values.There are phase-operators with one andwith two arguments.
A two-place phase-operator P-O(PI,P 2) is characterized bythe following properties:(B) If P = P-O(PI,P2), then P" ?
P~,i.
e. the set  of intervals of theresulting phase-set is the same asof the first argument;(C) For each phase-operator there is acharacteristic condition that sayshow q(p) is defined by q1(p) andP2 for all p ?
P~.
This conditionimplies always that q(p) = F fol-lows from q1(p) = F.SO the effect of applying P-O(PI,P 2) isthat some T-phases of PI change theirtruth value, new phases are not created.The character i s t i c  cond i t ions  arebased on %wo-place re la t ions  betweenintervals.
Let rel( , ) be such a rela-tion.
Then we define (by means of tel)q(p) according to the following scheme:CD)q(P) " fT, i f  q l (p )  = T and there  i sa P2 G P~ wi th  q2(P2) = Tand re l (P2oP) ;F o therwise- 198-We will use three phase-opera~ors anddefine their @v~uation functions in thefollowing way by (D)s(E) P = 0CC(P1,P2):rel(P2,p) is the relation"P2 and p overlap", i. e. P2nP  ~ ~.
(F) P = PER(P1,P2)srel(P2,p) is the relation"P2 contains p", i. e. P2 ~ p"(G) P = NEX(PI,P2)srel(P2,p) is the relation"P2 and p are not seperated fromeach other", i. e. P2uP  is aninterval.As an illustration we consider someexamples.
Needless to say~ that theirexact represention requires furtherformal equipment we have not introducedyet.
Typical cases for 0CC and PER ares(2) yesterda~ was bad weather.Overlapping of (yesterday> and a T-phase of (bad weather>.
(3) John worked the whole evening.A T-phase of ( evening> is containedin a T-phase of (John works>.
(for (evening>, (yesterday> cf.
7.
)There is only a slight difference be-tween the characteristic conditions for0CC and NEX: NEX admits additionallyonly b~EETS(P2,p) and ~LEETS(p,p2) in thesense of Allen (1984).
Later !
will mo-tivate that NEX is the appropriatephase-operator for the conjunction when.Therefore, sentences of the form(~) R1, when R 2.
(cf.
(N), (0))will be represented by an expressionthat contains NEX((R2> , (Rfl>) as core.The interpretation is thaC nothing hap-pens between a certain T-phase of (RI>an~ a certain T-phase of (R2~ (if theydo not overlap).The next operation we are going todefine is a one-place phase-operatorwith indeterminate character.
It may becalled "choice" or "singling out" andwill be denoted by xP~, where P1 =\[~,qd\] is again an arbitrary phase-sets(H) xP - \ [~ ,q~,  1 -P~ = ~ (set of intervals unchanged)IT for exactly one p withql(p) = T (if there is someq(p) = T-phase in P1)!F otherwiseIf we need different choices, we writexP1' YPI' zP2' ..., using the first signas an index in the mathematical sense.Moreover~we define one-place phase-operators with parameters:(I) KAR(PI,n) = \[Pm, q\]:P~ = ~ (set of intervals unchanged)i T, if qfl(p) = T and there areexactly n T-phases in PI;q(p)  =F otherwise (for all p g pmindependently of qq(p))Similarily one defines 0RD(PI,g) forintegers g: ORD(PI,g) assigns the valueT exactly to the g-th T-phase of PI' ifthere is one, with certain arrangementsfor g (e. g. how to express "t~e lastbut second" etc.
)Finally we define the "alternation"alt(P I) of an arbitrary phase-set P1 =\[l~1,ql\].
By alternation new phases maybe create~s alt(P1) contains exactlythose phases which one gets by joiningall phases of P1 that are not seperated~ o  - 199  -f rom each other and have the same valueq l (P l ) .
So the intervals of  alt(P I) areunions of intervals of PI' the q-valuesare the common ql-values of their parts(of.
(A)).
It is always alt(alt(P1)) =alt(P1) , and alt(P I) is complete, ifPI is complete.
Going from left toright on the time axis U, one has analternating succession of phases inalt(P1) with respect to the q-values.alt(P I) is the "maximal levelling" ofthe phase-set PI"4.
LOGICAL CONNECTIONSThe negation of a phase-set P1 is de-fined as follows:(J) ~PI = tP',qG:P~ = P~ (set of intervals unchanged)q(p) = neg(ql(p))Note that (~R> and N(R> may be dif-ferent because of non-equivalent phase-perspectives for ~R and R!For each two-place functor " u " (e.g.
"Q"  = "v" )  we aegina PI a P2' ifthe sets PI and P2 are equal:(K) PI m P2 = \[Pt'q3:P'= P;- P~q(p) = Pu(ql(p),q2(p)) , where F u isthe corresponding truth func-tion (e. g. vel for " w,,).Obviously for every phase-operator P-Othe expression P'O(PI'P2) "~ PI repre-sents both a phase-set and a clear "tau-tology" - in other words - a phase-setthat is "always true", if PI is complete.Therefore, alt(P-0(PI,P2)-~P1 ) = U ?
(where U ?
is the phase-set that containsthe time axis U as the only intervalwith the q-value T) reflects the doublenature of the aforesaid implication.5.
TRUTH CONDITIONSThe last considerations lead imme-deately to the following definitions.The whole formalism requires two typesof truth conditions, namely(L) a l t (P )  = U ?
(M) alt(P) # ~U ?
?They have different status: (L) isused, if the phase-set P is consideredas a temporal representation of some-thing that is valid, independently oftime.
(M) is applied~if P is consideredas something that represents a certain"time" (expressed by the phases of P).Because of the second possibility, altappears not only in truth conditions,but it may constitute arguments inphase-operators etc., too.
This will beshown in the examples below.Obviously one has for arbitraryphase-sets P = \[P',q~,alt(P) = U ?
iff V t~U~pGP~Cq(p)  = T ?
tap)altCP) ~ ~U?
iff ~t GU 3p~P~CqCp)  = Ta tGp)6.
SOME CO tgIRNT ON THE PORMALISMBy regarding the time axis U as abasic notion one has to take thetrouble to consider the topology of U,and gets difficulties with closed and- 200  -and open sets, environments etc.. Thismay be avoided by taking an axiomaticviewpoint: For all operations, relationsetc.
one formulates the essential prop-erties needed and uses them without di-rect connection to the time axis.
Inthis way U becomes a part of a modelof the whole formalism.
This is inde-pendent of the fact, that in definitionsand explanations U may appear for mak-ing clear what is meant.7 ?
TEMPORAL ADVERBI ALSIn section 2. we have outlined, howpropositions R are substituted by phase-sets (R>.
The same has to be done fortemporal adverbials.
First we considerdefinite adverbials: (tuesday> is aphase-set P, where P~ is the set of alldays (as spans p covering together thewhole time axis U), and exactly theTuesdays have the value q(p) = T. For(day>~he set pm is the same, but itis q(p) = T for all p G Pm.
(evening>has as intervals suitable subintervalsof the days with q(p) = T, whereas theremaining parts of the days form phaseswith q(p) = F in (evening> .
Analo-gously ( e~> contains all years asspans p with q(p) = T, whereas (1986>has the same spans, but exactly onewi th  q(p) = T.Now we combine temporal adverbialswith propositions.
An e~ct  representa-tion would require that we list allpossible structures of phrases, clausesetc.
that express a certain combination.We use instead of this "standard para-phrases" as "a~ least on Tuesdays R".
IfR is a certain proposition, e. g.R = John works in the library , thenthis paraphrase stands (as a remedy) for(5) John works, worked, ... in thelibrary every Tuesday.On every Tuesda~ John ...On Tuesda~ of ever~ week John ...A~ least on Tuesdays John ...Examples with truth condltionas(6) (the days, when R>= occ(<day>, (R>)~t( .

= u ?
(cf.
(F))(1986 is a year, throughout whichit is always true, tha~ everyTuesda~ is a day, when R occurs.
)The second argument of PER is a phase-set defined by an air-operation.
Thisphase-set has as T-phases exactly thosemaximal periods during which (8) holds., PER((~ear~,...) selects the years thatare covered by such a period, and thewhole expression says that 1986 is sucha year (and nothing about other years).The time of speech L is formally rep-resented by a phase-set L ?
with threephases, namely L itself with q(L) = T,and the two remaining infinite inter-vals with the q-value F. Then one maydefine (today> = 0CC((day~,L?).
By- 201 -using the phase-operator ORD (cf.
(I))one introduces (yesterday) etc., andsimilarily (this year> etc..(11) (in this year three times R= (R)"~KAR(OCO((R), (this year}) ,3 )alt(...) = U ?
(12)  ( the  three  t imes R in  th i s  ye.._ar)= KAR(OCC((R), (~his year ) )  ,3)sit(...) + ~U ?In (11) a yes-no-decision is expressed(there are three T-phases of (R ) in  thisyear), but in (12) a "time" is defined,namely the three T-phases of (R> in thisyear.
Therefore~the truth conditionsare different.
The expression in (12)may appear as an argument in other ex-pressions again.Now we apply the operation "choice":(13) (at most on Tuesdays three times R)= V OCC(x(da~),KAR(OCC((R), x(day~),3))-~<tuesda~)alt(...) = U ?OCC((R),x(day>) determines the T-phasesof (R) on a single day, KAR(...,3) keepsthem iff there are exactly three (other-wise they become F-phases, cf.
(I)),OCC(x(day},...) assigns to the singleday the value T i f f  the T-phases of (R)on this day have been preserved.
There-fore, ~OCC(...,...) is a T-F-distribu-tion over all days if x runs over alldays, and the whole expression saysthat all T-days are Tuesdays.

(9 ) )These examples demonstrate the applica-tion of logical functors.As one oan see,  the e~press ions  ren-der  it possible to formulate even rath-er complex temporal relations in a com-prehensible manner without much redun-dancy, the necessary arguments appearonly once (or twice for certain quanti-fications as e. g. (tuesday) and (da~in (8)).
In order to handle durations,one needs another phase-operator EXTthat is quite similar to KAR and ORD.The argument R stands either for "bare"propositions (without any temporal com-ponent) or for propositions with sometemporal components.
In the latter casethe corresponding expression has to besubstituted for (R):(q6) Ever~ Tuesda~ John watches tele-vision in the evening.Take (R) = (in the evenin~ R')with R' = John watches television.Then one can represent (R) by(R) = OCC( (R'}, (evening))with alt(...) ~ ~U ?
(John's t.v.-phases in evenings) and apply (8):( tuesda~ ) -~OCC(( day},0CC(( R' ), (evening~) )alt(...) = U OSimilarily one obtains (qO) from (8).The truth condition in (8) causes thatalt(...) occurs as argument in (qO).The sign "=" in the examples means thatthe left side is defined by the rightside, the left side is stripped of one(or more) temporal components.
In thissense (6), (8) and (9) are rules, (7)and (I0) include two rules in each case.The full and exact form of such rulesrequ i res  more than  the  s tandard  para -phrases ,  namely corresponding (syntac-tic) str~ctures on their left side.- 202  -8.
TENSESTill now nothing has been said abouttenses.
It is indeed possible to repre-sent tenses in the formalism that wehave outlined.
But it is impossible tointroduce "universal" rules for tenses.Even between closely related languageslike English and German there are essen-tial differences.
So it does not makesense to explain here the details forthe German tenses (of.
Kunze 1987).The main points in describing tensesare these: At first one needs a dis-tinction between "tense meanings" and"tense forms" (e. g. a Present-Perfect-form may be used as Future Perfect).After that one has to introduce specialconditions for special tense meanings(e. g. for perfect tenses in German andEnglish, for the aorist in other lan-guages).
Further a characterization oftense meanings by a scheme like Reichen-bach's is necessary, including the in-troduction of the time of speech L ?.On this basis rules for tense-assign-ment may be formulated expressing whiohtenses (= meanings) a phase xP or aphase-set P can be assigned to.
Fromthe formal point of view tenses thenlook like very general adverbials, andit is rather easy to explain how tensesand adverbials fit together.
Tense-assignments create new expressions inadd i t ion  to  those used above.
It i s  im-por tant  that  the pos i t ion  o f  the phaseso f  (R> does not  depend on the tense  Ri s  used w i th :  The tense  se lec ts  some ofthese phases by phase-operators.
Soalt(NEX(xP,L?))

~U ?
is the basic con-dition for the actual Present (of.
(G)).9.
TEMPORAL CONJUNCTIONSFor some temporal conjunctions thereare two basic variants, the "particular"usage and the "iterative" usage.
We il-lustrate this phenomenon for when:(N) whenl (particular usage of when):WHENI(RI,R2): (for "RI, when R2")alt(NEX((~2>,(~1~ )) * ~u ?.
(17) When John went to the l ibrar~he found 10 ~.
(Once t when ... )In (17) there is a reference to a singleT-phase of (RI> and a single T-phase of(R2).
One can show that the truth con-dition for when I is equivalent to3x  SyCaltCNEXCx(R2),YCRI>)) * ~U ?)
,but this form is avoidable (cf.
(H)and the end of 5.).
(0) when2(iterative usage of when):WHEN2RI,R2): (for "RI, when R2")(18) When John went to the library.he took the bus.
(Whenever ... )In (18) something is said about allT-phases of (R2~ , namelyVx  3y(alt(NEX(x(R2~ ,y(R~ ) * NuO) ,which is equivalent to the truth condi-tion for when 2.Conjunctions like while, as lon~ asetc.
are represented in a similar waywith the phase-operator PER (cf.
(F)).For the conjunctions after, before,since and till one needs in addition anANTE- and a POST-operator, which aretense-dependent (the main differenceis caused by imperfective vs. perfec-tive) and modify the arguments of thephase-operators.
Some of the conjunc-tions have both basic variants, whereassince admits no iterative usage.- 203  -The meaning of since is expressed by(P) since: (only particular usage)SINCE(Rfl,R2): (for "Rfl, since R2")alt(P~(PosT((~2)), (RI)~ ~ ~u ?,and the truth condition for afterq is(Q) afterq (particular usage of after)sAFTERI(Rq,R2): (for "Rq, after R2")alt(PER((RI~ ,POST((R2)))) , ~U ?It turns out that an analysis of tem-poral conjunctions based only on theReichenbach scheme causes some difficul-ties.
It works very well for when andwhile (cf.
Hornstein 1977) and the Ger-man equivalents (als/wenn, w~hrend andsolam~e), but for the remaining casesANTE- and POST-operations seem to beinivitable.qO .
AN F~iPIRI CAL CONFIP~IATIONBy combining the rules for te~se-as-sig~ment and the truth conditions forthe temporal conjunctions (in Germanthere are seven basic types) and by al-lowing for some res~rictiomsfor theiruse (e. g. als only for Past, seit notfor Future) one gets for each conjunc-tion a prediction about the possiblecombinations of tenses in the matrixand the temporal clause.Gelhaus (q97@) has published statis-tical data about the distributions oftenses in the matrix and the temporalclause for German.
From the huge L!MAS-corpus the took all instances of the useof temporal conjunctions.
From my cal-culus one cannot obtain statistics,of course, it decides only on "correct-hess".
The comparlsion proved thatthere is an almost complete coincidence.The combinations for als/wenn cannot bederived, if one takes OOC instead of NEXin (N) and (O).
The same seems to be thecase for when.
The restrictions for thepropositions R I and R 2 (e. g. \[+FINIT\]),given by Wunderlich (1970), can be de-duced from the truth conditions (detailsabout both questions in (Kunze (1987)).REFERENCESAllen, James P.. 1984 Towards a GeneralTheory of Action and Time.
