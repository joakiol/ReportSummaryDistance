Project Summary:Natural Lanfuaoe Understandinf: Intcoratin?
S~/ntaz, Semantics, and Discourse.Institution: UNISYSPrincipal Investigators: Dr. Lynette Hirschman, Dr. Martha PalmerTechnical Summary: The focus of the UNISYS research is on integrating multiple knowledge sources,including syntax, semantics, pragmatics, a domain model, and both domain-specific and domain-independent knowledge sources, to produce a system capable of understanding messages in a res-tricted domain.Objeeti~ea:(1) Creation of an integrated, portable system for the detailed understanding of multi-paragraphtext and messages.(2).
Develop a principled computational treatment of semantic and discourse phenomena, includ-ing treatment of reference and temporal information.
(3) Development of an integrated loglc-based analysis algorithm which uses syntactic, semantic anddiscourse information to maximize robustness and search focus.
(4) Build a spoken language system through integration of a large natural language system with aspeech recognition system.Recent Accomplishments:* System: Development of modular, interleaved system architecture, enhancing portability byenforcing segregation of core PUNDIT from domaln-speclfic modules.
Demonstrated by portto domain of Navy Trouble Failure Reports.?
Applications: Processing of CAS17~P messages, producing tabular summary; Navy RAINFORM(sighting messages), and Trouble and Failure reports, producing database updates.?
Technology Transfer Activity: PUNDIT User's Guide released, system installed at NationalLibrary of Medicine, Unisys applications group; system requested by RADC, CECOM, Harvard, U.Penn., Cambridge U., Swedish Inst.
of Computer Science.?
Treatment of fragmentary input as found in message traffic, by means of minimal extensions tothe syntactic, semantic and pragmatic omponents.?
Semantic coverage of nominallzed verbs, adjectival participles and noun predicates, based onthe treatment of the underlying predicate, using reference resolution and temporal processing tocomplete the interpretation.?
Interactive selection component, interleaved with syntax, uses semantic (selectlonal) informationto filter parses, producing dramatic, 6-fold, decrease in number of parses.?
Modules for processing intra-sentential temporal information and referring expressions (includingdefinite and indefinite noun phrases, phrases with omitted determiners, and reference to events).?
Integration of contextual information from fixed message fields with that from free-text fields: sys-tem now handles complex multl-paragraph message formats.Plan8 for nezt year:Demonstrate xtensibUity of PUNDIT to new messages, howing correct information capture byfilling in 70~ of target DB fields with a false positive rate of less than 5~.Integrate PUNDIT with knowledge representation and reasoning systems to provide inferencingcapabilities for correct filling of DB fields.Treatment of intersentential temporal relations and implementation of a domain-independentdiscourse management component, for handling a variety of message formats.Demonstrate PUNDIT on Resource Management domain, in preparation for Spoken LanguageUnderstanding.265
