The Perils and Rewards of DevelopingRestricted Domain ApplicationsDaniel MarcuInformation Sciences Institute andDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of Southern California4676 Admiralty Way, Suite 1001Marina del Rey, CA 90292marcu@isi.eduAbstractOver the last three decades, the development ofrestricted domain applications has been an ongo-ing theme in computational linguistic research.Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, Sum-marization, and Question Answering researchershave all built at one time or another restricteddomain systems.
In retrospect, it is long due toexamine both the successes and failures of theseprevious attempts.In this talk, I will examine the circumstancesin which the development of restricted domainapplications has led to significant advances in thestate of the art and the circumstances in whichrestricted domain research has had little impacton our field.
I will use the lessons learned fromprevious attempts to building restricted domainnatural language processing applications in orderto examine the potential impact of current re-search in restricted domain question answering.
