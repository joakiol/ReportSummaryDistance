The POSTBIOTM/W isintended to assist biologist in mining use-ful information efficiently from biomed-ical text resources.
To do so, it pro-vides a suit of tools for gathering, manag-ing, analyzing and annotating texts.
Theworkbench is implemented in Java, whichmeans that it is platform-independent.1 IntroductionLarge amounts of biomedical literature exist and thevolume continues to grow exponentially.
Followingthe increase of literature, there is growing need forappropriate tools in support of collecting, managing,creating, annotating and exploiting rich biomedicaltext resources.Especially, information on interactions among bi-ological entities is very important for understandingthe biological process in a living cell (Blascheke et.al., 1999).
In our POSBIOTM/W workbench, weuse a supervised machine learning method to gen-erate rules automatically to extract biological eventsfrom free texts with minimum human effort.
And weadopt the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model(Lafferty et.
al.,2001) for the biomedical named-entity recognition (NER) task.
Finally, to reduce the?
The research was supported by Brain Neuro InformaticsResearch program by MOCIE.1POSBIOTM/W stands for POSTECH Bio-Text MiningSystem Workbenchlabeling effort in a larger extent we incorporate anactive learning idea into the workbench.2 System DescriptionThe POSBIOTM/W comprises a set of appropriatetools to provide users a convenient environment forgathering, managing and analyzing biomedical textand for named-entity annotation.
The workbenchconsists of four components: Managing tool, NERtool, Event Extraction Tool and Annotation Tool.And we adopt an active learning idea into the work-bench to improve the NER and the Event Extractionmodule?s performance.

Users can access to the PubMeddatabase of bibliographic information using quicksearching bar and incremental PubMed search en-gine.362.2 NER toolThe NER tool is a client tool of POSBIOTM-NER module and able to automatically annotatebiomedical-related texts.
The NER tool providesaccess to three target-specific named entity mod-els - GENIA-NER model, GENE-NER model andGPCR-NER model.
Each of these model is trainedbased on GENIA-Corpus (Kim et.
al., 2003),BioCreative data (Blaschke et.
al., 2004) and POS-BIOTM/NE corpus2 respectively.
In POSBIOTM-NER system, we adopt the Conditional RandomFields (CRF) model (Lafferty et.
al., 2001) for thebiomedical NER task.2.3 Event Extraction toolThe Event Extraction tool extracts several biologi-cal events from texts using automatically generatedrules.
We use a supervised machine learning methodto overcome a knowledge-engineering bottleneck bylearning event extraction rules automatically.
Wemodify the WHISK (Soderland, 1999) algorithm toprovide a two-level rule learning method as a divide-and-conquer strategy.
In two-level rule learning, thesystem learns event extraction rules which are insideof the noun chunk at first level, and then it learns therules for whole sentence.Since the system extracts biological events usingautomatically generated rules, we can not guaranteethat every extracted event is always correct becausemany different rules can be applied to the same sen-tence.
Therefore we try to verify the result with aMaximum Entropy (ME) classifier to remove incor-rectly extracted events.
For each extracted event,we verify each component of the event with the MEclassifier model.
If one component is contradictedto the class assigned by the classification model, wewill remove the event.
For detail event extractionprocess, please consult our previous paper (Kim et.al., 2004).2.4 Annotation toolOur workbench provides a Graphical User Interfacebased Annotation tool which enables the users toannotate and correct the result of the named-entityrecognition and the event extraction.
And users can2POSBIOTM/NE corpus, our own corpus, is used to identifyfour target named entities: protein, gene, small molecule andcellular process.upload the revised data to the POSBIOTM system,which would contribute to the incremental build-upof named-entity and relation annotation corpus.2.5 Active learningTo minimize the human labeling effort, we employthe active learning method to select the most infor-mative samples.
We proposed a new active learningparadigm which considers not only the uncertaintyof the classifier but also the diversity of the corpus,which will soon be published.ReferencesChristian Blaschke, Andrade, M.A., Ouzouis, C., Valen-cia, A.. 1999.
