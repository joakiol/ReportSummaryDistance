The first very large volume ofmodern Chinese concordances (two sets of onemillion-line KWIC index) has been compiled andmaterialized automatically with a modified kanjiprinter for Japanese.INTRODUCTIONThis paper describes an experiment to compileChinese concordances automatically.
A verylarge volume of KWIC indexes for modern Chinese(one million lines per set) has been compiledsuccessfully with a kanji printer for Japanese.This paper discusses the purposes of theexperiment, selection and input of the Chinesedata, some statistics on Chinese characters (vs.kanji) and the concordance compilation process.Finally, examples from the computer-generatedconcordances are shown.THE PURPOSESThe idea of machine-processingmodern Chinesedata originally came from Professor Yuen RenChao, Agassiz Professor Emeritus of OrientalLanguages at the University of California atBerkeley, before one of the authors (Hashimoto)took over the directorship of the PrincetonChinese linguistics project.
Chao served as thechief of the advisory committee to the projectsince its foundation.
The idea, in short, was:so much has been said about the Chinesepai-hua-wen -- a written language of modernChina -- yet nobody has ever clarified what itreally was, i.e.
; what the basic vocabulary was,what the major syntactic structure was, etc.
: inother words the every detail of the reality ofpai-hua-wen.
Certain quantitative surveys weredone before us, but even the most extensive onein those days was based on data consisting of nomore than i00,000 characters.
In addition, theselection was very poorly done -- most of thematerials were primary school textbooks.
We didnot believe that school textbooks reflected thereality of the language, even in its writtenform.
We chose one digit more than the previousone, namely 1,000,000 characters, though forvarious reasons, the actual data contained inour tape include several thousands more than onemillion \[i, 2\].After completion of the computer input andediting of the million-character file atPrinceton, researches towards statisticalaspects of the data have been conducted \[4\].
Asstated in \[4\], tables of character frequency cantell us various aspects of the Chinese, such asthe basic character set, transient states ofcharacter strings and so on.
This can besummarized as the first step of computer-processing modern Chinese data.
However, inorder to understand the reality of a language,besides statistics, concordances are thenecessities which illustrate the contexts whereand how those characters are used.On the other hand, computer applications toChinese have very limited background so for.
Nocomputer-generated concordances on Chinese havebeen reported yet.
Thus the concordancegenaration project would not only be valuable tothe understanding of Chinese pai-hua-wen, butalso contribute to the development of themethodology to manipulate Chinese automatically.Consequently, a project to compile concordancesof the Princeton million-character file wasconducted at the Electrotechnical Laboratoryduring 1977-1979.
This constitutes the secondimportant stage of computer-processing modernChinese.THE CHINESE DATAThe Input of the Original DataThe first phase of the data input was done inTaiwan during 1969-1972 with a Chinese characterkeyboard, designed by Cheng Chin Kao -- aChinese teletype Machine (manufactured by theOki Denki Co., Ltd.).
The code was convertedinto the Chinese standard telegraphic code inWalthum, Massachusetts at a computer company.The greatest difficulty, in addition to ordinaryproofreading, consisted in the conversion of theso-called "combination characters" of theC.C.Kao system: any character not found in theKao keyboard was punched so that part of it(normally the "radical") was represented by acharacter having the same radical in thekeyboard, and another by a character having thesame "signific".
Necessary flags were of courseattached to these "combination characters", yetthe key punchers selected those constituentcharacters quite at random, sometimes--323-disregarding the position of a radical within acharacter, so that the results were often ahopeless mess.The Selection of the DataIt was tried, at the selection of the data, tocover every conceivable category and style ofwritings in China since her modernization, theso-called May 5 Movement period, from ordinarynovels to philosophical writings, from politicalspeeches to newspaper articles, etc.
etc.
Thesecategories and styles were classified and wereassigned appropriate marks to show the genre.The partial list of these writings follow:~,~: ~/Q~\[~~ :~ : - y .~~:  ~ '~: f .I~ :  ~ }~~:  ~t~A~ :  ~~i~!
: T ~  ~:  ~P~~:  ~t~T ~:  ~:~For a complete list of all these writings and ofthe genre marks, see \[3\].
All the proper nounswere so marked, as they may not correctlycontribute to any statistical measurement of thewritten language except for these proper nounsthemselves.
These nouns were marked in theoriginal texts by research assistants withenough command of the language to make correctjudgment.
Anything else, including punctuationmarks of all sorts, in the texts were properlyprocessed.
Every sentence, including somevocative phrases, was numbered within thewriting piece quite mechanicaly, thoughoccasionally it was necessary for specialists tomake certain judgment for segmenting sentences.The Code SystemThe Chinese standard telegraphic code systemincludes some 9500 codes for Chinese characters.A code consists of a set of 4 digits, whichrepresents one Chinese character.
Among those9500, 5231 have been used.StatisticsStatistical analysis of this million-characterfile can be found in \[4\].
Some additionalstatistics are provided here.

Frequency Distribution ofChinese Character Types- 324  -CHINESE CHARACTERS VS. KANJIChinese characters were imported into Japansometime in the 5th century?
Since then, theyhave been extensively used with a few additionalcharacters created in Japan (this modified setof Chinese characters is called "kanji"),although hiragana and katakana (two sets of pureJapanese characters with their origin also inthe forms of Chinese characters) were inventedearly in the 9th century.
"Chinese characters for daily use"established by the Ministry of Education formodern Japanese includes a 18S0 kanji set,however several thousand more are still in useespecially for proper nouns.
The JapaneseIndustrial Standard (JIS) "Code of the JapaneseGraphic Character Set for Information Exchange(C6226)" established in 1978 includes a 6349kanji set, hiragana, katakana, Roman alphabet,Greek letters, Russian letters and othersymbols.
The kanji set is grouped into 2levels, the first level a 2965 kanji set and thesecond level a 3384 kanji set.
This means some3000 kanji are considered to be enough for basicinformation exchange in Japanese.
In thisexperiment, the kanji printer system T4100i .

A total of8182 characters was available for this printerincluding 7360 kanji, hiragana, katakana, Romanalphabet, and other miscellaneous symbols.
Thesystem was developed 5 years before theestablishment of JIS C6226.As mentioned before, the million-characterfile included 5231 different Chinese characters?Among them, 295 were found to be unprintable(because they were not found in the T4100system).
The fonts of those 295 characters weredesigned and incorporated into the T4100 system.Later, when JIS C6226 was established, some ofthose 295 characters were found in the secondlevel of the kan~i set, namely ~(frequency773), ~(581), ~'(563), ~(345),-~(343),~189) ,~(178) ,  and .~%(158).
Fig.

This factindicates that Chinese characters and kanjistill overlap closely in modern Chinese andJapanese.
(It should be noticed that thesimplified Chinese characters are out of thisscope since they did not exist at the so-calledMay 5 Movement period.

Extensivework had to be done to interpret and reformeditorial symbols.
Fig.
5 shows the edited textsentences from the million-character file.After this editorial step and incorporation ofChinese character fonts to the T4100 kanjiprinting ststem, the concordance compilationprocess was started.
Since we have hadexperience with the automatic compilation ofone-million line concordances in Japanese \[S\],not many technical difficulties wereencountered, except some malfunctions of our oldkanji printer.
Discussions on the salientfeatures of those Chinese concordances follow.Key WordsKWIC index style has been adopted as the form ofChinese concordances, since it is one of themost fundamental styles for computer-generatedconcordances?
Because there is no clearsegmentation of words in Chinese, and becauseone character represents a fairly sizable amountof information, each character was chosen as a"key word".
Furthermore, no elimination of"non-key words" were made.
Every character(including punctuation) was chosen as a keycharacter.
In this sense, the concordance may henamed as "All characters in context" index.Consequently, one million character datarequired one million lines of index.ContextsOne of the deficiencies of the KWIC index styleis that the context each line can show islimited to its line length.
We could afford 55characters for the context.
Since one or twoChinese characters represent a word, this lengthcan accommodate more than 30 words ofinformation in English.Reverse Sorted IndexTwo types of KWIC index have been produced.
Oneis for the normal type, in which all lines aresorted in the ascending order of the Chinesestandard telegraphic code of key characters(plus 7 succeeding characters).
Fig.
6 shows anexample page from this type of index.
The otheris the so called "reverse sorted" index.
Themajor key for this type is the same as that ofthe normal type.
The minor sort keys are, thecharacters immediately preceding the major key.Thus all lines for one key character are listedin the ascending order of the code for thecharacter immediately preceding the keycharacter and so on.
Fig.
7 shows an examplepage from the reverse sorted concordance.CONCLUDING REMARKSThe two sets of modern Chinese concordances canbe reached at the National Inter-universityResearch Institute of Asian and AfricanLanguages and Cultures, Tokyo University ofForeign Studies.
It should be noted that aconcordance of one million lines amounts to over25,000 pages (actually it counts for 27,341) or50 volumes of a 5cm-width paper file.
Beforeprinting the whole index, engineers recommendedlinguists to use COM technique, but in vain.
Amicrofiche version should have been produced forportability.
Analysis of the concordances havejust got off the ground.
The resulting papersare expected to follow.345~9~,&,?~,~T,  l~?~f~,~i~ ' f~-~,  ~ , ~ , ~ T ~ o~ ~ , ~ ,  ~,~,  ~p~t~.
