Corpus-based approaches to processing the scope of negationcues: an evaluation of the state of the artRoser Morante, Sarah Schrauwen and Walter DaelemansCLiPS-CL University of Antwerp{Roser.Morante,Walter.Daelemans}@ua.ac.beSarah.Schrauwen@student.ua.ac.beAbstractIn this paper we summarize existing work on the recently introduced task of processing the scopeof negation and modality cues; we analyse the scope model that existing systems can process, whichis mainly the model reflected in the annotations of the biomedical corpus on which the systems havebeen trained; and we point out aspects of the scope finding task that would be different based onobservations from a corpus from a different domain and nature.1 IntroductionNegation and modality are complex aspects of the semantics of language.
Modality was introducedby Jespersen (1924), who distinguishes between two categories of mood that later have been namedas deontic modality and epistemic modality.
Lyons (1996) describes epistemic modality as concernedwith matters of knowledge and belief, ?the speaker?s opinion or attitude towards the proposition that thesentence expresses or the situation that the proposition describes?.
Palmer (1986) defines it as expressingthe speaker?s degree of commitment to the truth of a proposition.
Polarity is a discrete category that cantake two values: positive and negative.
Positive polarity is used by speakers to put information as a factin the world, whereas negative polarity is used to put information as a counterfact, a fact that does nothold in the world.
Negation is a linguistic resource used to express negative polarity.Although the treatment of these topics in computational linguistics is relatively new compared toother areas like machine translation, parsing or semantic role labeling, incorporating information aboutmodality and polarity has been shown to be useful for a number of applications, such as biomedicaltext processing (Di Marco and Mercer, 2005; Chapman et al, 2001), opinion mining and sentimentanalysis (Wilson et al, 2005), recognizing textual entailment (Snow et al, 2006), and automatic stylechecking (Ganter and Strube, 2009).
In general, the treatment of modality and negation is very relevantfor computational applications that process factuality (Saur?
?, 2008).
For example, information extractionsystems may be confronted with fragments of texts like the one presented in (1)1, which contains twonegation cues2 (not, un-) and one speculation cue (likely) that affect the factuality of the events beingexpressed:(1) The atovaquone/proguanil combination has not been widely used yet in West Africa so it is unlikely that the patientwas initially infected with an atovaquone-resistant strain.So far two main tasks have been addressed within the natural language processing (NLP) community:(i) the detection of various forms of polarity and modality and (ii) the identification of the scope ofnegation and modality cues.
In this paper we reflect on the achievements of the recently introducedscope finding task (Section 2), we analyse the scope model that existing systems can process (Section 3),and we point out aspects of the scope finding task that would be different based on observations from acorpus from a different domain (Section 4).1Example to be found in http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1475-2875-1-1.pdf [last consulted 8-10-2010]2A cue is the lexical marker that expresses negation or modality.3502 Achievements in scope processingIn the last years, several corpora have been annotated with information related to modality and polarity,which have made it possible to develop machine learning systems.
Annotation has been performed atdifferent levels: word (Hassan and Radev, 2010), expression (Baker et al, 2010; Toprak et al, 2010),sentence (Medlock and Briscoe, 2007), event (Saur??
and Pustejovsky, 2009), discourse relation (Prasadet al, 2006), text (Amancio et al, 2010), and scope of negation and modality cues (Vincze et al, 2008).Thanks to the existence of the BioScope corpus, the scope processing task was recently introduced.
Bio-Scope is a freely available resource, that consists of three parts of medical and biological texts annotatedwith negation and hedge cues and their scope.The scope processing task is concerned with determining at a sentence level which tokens are affectedby modality and negation cues.
It was first modelled as a classification problem by Morante et al (2008).Later on several systems have been trained on the same corpus (Morante and Daelemans, 2009; O?zgu?rand Radev, 2009; Agarwal and Yu, 2010; Li et al, 2010).
Councill et al (2010) process scopes ofnegation cues in a different corpus of product reviews, but this corpus is not publicly available.The CoNLL Shared Task 2010 on Learning to detect hedges and their scope in natural languagetext (Farkas et al, 2010) boosted research on the topic.
It consisted of identifying sentences containinguncertainty and recognizing speculative text spans inside sentences.
Participating systems would, forexample, produce the tagged sentence in (2)3, in which propose, suggest and possible are identified ashedge cues and their scope is marked in agreement with the gold standard.
(2) We [propose propose that the existence of the alternative alignments, specific to distinct groups of genes, [suggestsuggests presence of different synchronization modes between the two organisms and [possible possible functionaldecoupling of particular physiological gene networks in the course of evolution possible]suggest]propose] .The best system (Morante et al, 2010) for hedge scope finding in the CoNLL ST 2010 scores 57.32F-score.
Although the results are lower than the scores obtained in other well established tasks (i.e.semantic role labeling, dependency parsing), we can say that setting the first step towards automatic scopeprocessing is an achievement.
However, it can be useful to revise the characteristics of the scopes thatthe systems learn to process, not from a technical machine learning perspective, but from the linguisticannotation perspective, since the annotation model that systems learn determines the quality of the systemoutput and the knowledge that can be inferred from the scopes.3 Scope model based on the BioScope corpusMost existing scope labelers have been trained on the BioScope corpus.
Thus, the model of scope thatthese systems learn is determined by the characteristics of scope as they have been annotated in BioScope.Additionally, the systems have been trained for a specific domain, biomedical texts, but it might be thecase that negation and speculation cues require different annotation specifications for texts from otherdomains.
In this section we analyze the characteristics of the scope model in the BioScope corpus basedon the guidelines (BioScope, 2008) and we propose some changes for further annotation work that weare carrying out.
We mark in italics the statements from the BioScope guidelines and we comment onthem.?
The scope is always a continuous sequence of tokens and the cue is included in the scope.
Althoughmost scopes in the corpus are continuous, examples such as (3), in which sentence adverbs do not belongto the scope, suggest that the scopes should be annotated as discontinuous if necessary:(3) [not The number of glucocorticoid receptors per cell (Ro) and the binding affinity (Kd) for dexamethasone werenot] ,however, [notnot significantly different not]?
Scopes can be determined on the basis of syntax and they extend to the biggest unit possible.
Ifnecessary, complements and adjuncts are included in the scope.
It would be useful to furhter specifyhow different syntactic constructions (coordination, subordination, etc.)
should be annotated.3In the examples below, cues will be marked in bold and their scope between brackets.351?
The scope of negative auxiliaries, adjectives and adverbs usually starts with the cue and ends at theend of the phrase, clause or sentence.
In (4) the scope extends to the right of not.
In our view, the scopeshould include the subject because the subject contributes to the meaning of the event being negated.
If,as Lyons (1996) suggest, we paraphrase the negative connective in (4) with the formula it is not the casethat, we obtain (5), where the subject is under the scope of the formula.
(4) Once again, the Disorder module does [not not contribute positively to the prediction not](5) Once again, it is not the case that the Disorder module does contribute positively to the prediction?
Passive voice changes the scope of the cue because the object of the active construction is the subjectof the passive construction.
According to the BioScope guidelines, the scope of not in 6 and 7 wouldbe annotated differently.
As indicated above, we consider that the subject of the active sentence is alsounder the scope of the negation, so in our view both sentences should be analyzed equally.
(6) [not Levels of RNA coding for the receptor were not modulated by exposure to high levels of ligand not](7) Exposure to high levels of ligand does [not not modulate levels of RNA coding for the receptor not]?
Negative conjunctions generally scope over the syntactic unit whose members it coordinates.
However,if the complex negative keyword occurs within the subject of the sentence, its scope is extended to thewhole sentence.
(8) is the example provided in the guidelines, but paraphrasing the sentence with the itis not the case formula as in (9) shows that the subject should also be included in the scope.
(8) In contrast, sodium salicylate (1 mM) inhibited [neither?norneither adhesion nor expression of these adhesionmolecules neither?nor](9) In contrast, it is not the case that sodium salicylate (1 mM) inhibits either adhesion or expression of these adhesionmolecules?
Prepositions scope over the following (noun) phrase.
(10) is the example provided in the guidelines,where without scopes over a noun phrase.
Nevertheless, without can be followed by a verb phrase, as in(11).
In this case, one could argue that the logical subject of the verb should be included in the scope ofthe preposition, since the negation can be paraphrased as in (12).
(10) [without Mildly hyperinflated lungs without focal opacity without](11) [without CD28 costimulation without] augments IL-2 secretion of activated lamina propria T cells by increasingmRNA stability [without without enhancing IL-2 gene transactivation without](12) It is not the case that CD28 costimulation enhances IL-2 gene transactivationPossible improvements in the BioScope annotation model are pointed out in Vincze (2010), namelythe treatment of elliptic constructions, and discontinuous and intersecting scopes.
An additional im-provement would be to annotate affixal negation.
We consider that (13) is equivalent to (14) and shouldreceive the same analysis, since they can be paraphrased as in (15):(13) Actually, [un tRNASec and tRNAPyl have unusual secondary structures 515 un](14) Actually, [not tRNASec and tRNAPyl do not have usual secondary structures 515 not](15) Actually, it is not the case that tRNASec and tRNAPyl have usual secondary structures 5154 Annotating scopes in a different domainThe existing scope labelers have been trained on biomedical texts.
However, it is reasonable to expectthat texts from other domains contain different phenomena that would affect the systems performance.We are currently analysing negations and their scopes in a complete different corpus, The Hound of theBaskervilles (HB) by Conan Doyle.
This corpus has been annotated with coreference and semantic rolesfor the SemEval Task Linking Events and Their Participants in Discourse (Ruppenhofer et al, 2010), andwill be further annotated with negation and modality cues.
Phenomena in this corpus show that whereasthe scope of cues can be determined in a similar way as it is determined in biomedical texts, identifying352negation cues in certain contexts, which is the first part of the scope finding task, is not only a matter oflexical lookup:?
Not all negative affixes are negation cues.
For example the affix un- in unspoken does not negate itsroot morpheme.
Unspoken does not mean ?not spoken?, but ?understood without the need for words?.Consequently, in (16) unspoken is not a negation cue.
(16) All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist?
Fixed expressions like could not help in the sentence below do not negate the modified event.
(17) Why about Sir Henry in particular?
I could not help asking?
Negation words in tag questions do not have a negation function, but a pragmatic function, since thespeaker seeks confirmation from the addressee.
A similar case are negation words in dialogue checkslike don?t you think in (19).
(18) You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson?
(19) Don?t you think, Watson, that you are away from your charge rather long??
Negation words in exclamative particles do not have a negation function.
In (20), don?t tell me doesnot express a negated event.
This is a multiword construction used to express surprise.
(20) ?Don?t tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!??
Some modality cues, such as no doubt, contain false negation cues.
In (21) no doubt is a fixedexpression that expresses certainty, no event is negated.
It is an expression that acts at the discourse levelconveying information about the attitude of the speaker towards his statement.
(21) Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and surprise those who were aroundhim?
The context influences the effect of the negation cue.
The volitive verb wish in (22) and the conditionalconstruction in (23) cancel the negative effect of not.
(22) Your mission to-day has justified itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his side(23) In fact, if you had not gone to-day it is exceedingly probable that I should have gone to-morrow5 Conclusions and future workIn this paper we have briefly presented the achievements in processing the scope of negation and modalitycues.
There are currently several systems that can process scopes in biomedical texts, however there is alack of annotated resources, since there is only one publicly available corpus.
We have also pointed outthat the quality of the systems output depends not only on the technical aspects of the systems, but alsoon the linguistic model contained in the annotations.
Based on annotation work on a literary corpus, wehave pointed out some difficulties that existing systems could face in detecting cues.We are currently annotating texts by Conan Doyle with negation cues and their scopes.
For definingthe guidelines we take the model of the BioScope corpus as a starting point and we include modifica-tions based on the observations made above.
The annotated corpus and the guidelines will be publiclyavailable.Apart from annotating more data, further work will focus on computing the factuality of statementsbased on the scopes of negation and modality cues and other contextual features, and studying the inter-action between negation and modality.AcknowledgementsThis study was made possible through financial support from the University of Antwerp (GOA projectBIOGRAPH).
