ChangDepartment of ComputerScienceNational Tsing HuaUniversity101, Kuangfu Road,Hsinchu, Taiwanjschang@cs.nthu.edu.twAbstractIn this paper, we describe TANGO as acollocational concordancer for looking upcollocations.
The system was designed toanswer user?s query of bilingual collocationalusage for nouns, verbs and adjectives.
We firstobtained collocations from the largemonolingual British National Corpus (BNC).Subsequently, we identified collocationinstances and translation counterparts in thebilingual corpus such as Sinorama ParallelCorpus (SPC) by exploiting the word-alignment technique.
The main goal of theconcordancer is to provide the user with areference tools for correct collocation use soas to assist second language learners to acquirethe most eminent characteristic of native-likewriting.1 IntroductionCollocations are a phenomenon of wordcombination occurring together relatively often.Collocations also reflect the speaker?s fluency of alanguage, and serve as a hallmark of near native-like language capability.Collocation extraction is critical to a range ofstudies and applications, including naturallanguage generation, computer assisted languagelearning, machine translation, lexicography, wordsense disambiguation, cross language informationretrieval, and so on.Hanks and Church (1990) proposed using point-wise mutual information to identify collocations inlexicography; however, the method may result inunacceptable collocations for low-count pairs.
Thebest methods for extracting collocations usuallytake into consideration both linguistic andstatistical constraints.
Smadja (1993) also detailedtechniques for collocation extraction anddeveloped a program called XTRACT, which iscapable of computing flexible collocations basedon elaborated statistical calculation.
Moreover, loglikelihood ratios are regarded as a more effectivemethod to identify collocations especially when theoccurrence count is very low (Dunning, 1993).Smadja?s XTRACT is the pioneering work onextracting collocation types.
XTRACT employedthree different statistical measures related to howassociated a pair to be collocation type.
It iscomplicated to set different thresholds for eachstatistical measure.
We decided to research anddevelop a new and simple method to extractmonolingual collocations.We also provide a web-based user interfacecapable of searching those collocations and itsusage.
The concordancer supports languagelearners to acquire the usage of collocation.
In thefollowing section, we give a brief overview of theTANGO concordancer.2 TANGOTANGO is a concordancer capable of answeringusers?
queries on collocation use.
Currently,TANGO supports two text collections: amonolingual corpus (BNC) and a bilingual corpus(SPC).
The system consists of four main parts:2.1 Chunk and Clause InformationIntegratedFor CoNLL-2000 shared task, chunking isconsidered as a process that divides a sentence intosyntactically correlated parts of words.
With thebenefits of CoNLL training data, we built achunker that turn sentences into smaller syntacticstructure of non-recursive basic phrases tofacilitate precise collocation extraction.
It becomeseasier to identify the argument-predicaterelationship by looking at adjacent chunks.
Bydoing so, we save time as opposed to n-gramstatistics or full parsing.
Take a text in CoNLL-2000 for example:The words correlated with the same chunk tagcan be further grouped together (see Table 1).
Forinstance, with chunk information, we can extractConfidence/B-NP in/B-PP the/B-NPpound/I-NP is/B-VP widely/I-VP ex-pected/I-VP to/I-VP take/I-VP an-other/B-NP sharp/I-NP dive/I-NP if/B-SBAR trade/B-NP figures/I-NP for/B-PPSeptember/B-NP(Note: Every chunk type is associated with twodifferent chunk tags: B-CHUNK for the first wordof the chunk and I-CHUNK for the other words inthe same chunk)the target VN collocation ?take dive?
from theexample by considering the last word of twoadjacent VP and NP chunks.
We build a robust andefficient chunking model from training data of theCoNLL shared task, with up to 93.7% precisionand recall.Sentence chunking FeaturesConfidence NPin PPthe pound NPis expected to take VPanother sharp dive NPif SBARtrade figures NPfor PPSeptember NPTable 1: Chunked SentenceIn some cases, only considering the chunkinformation is not enough.
For example, thesentence ?
?the attitude he had towards thecountry is positive??
may cause problem.
Withthe chunk information, the system extracts out thetype ?have towards the country?
as a VPNcollocation, yet that obviously cuts across twoclauses and is not a valid collocation.
To avoid thatkind of errors, we further take the clauseinformation into account.With the training and test data from CoNLL-2001, we built an efficient HMM model to identifyclause relation between words.
The languagemodel provides sufficient information to avoidextracting wrong collocations.
Examples show asfollows (additional clause tags will be attached):(1) ?.the attitude (S* he has *S) toward the country(2) (S* I think (S* that the people are mostconcerned with the question of (S* whenconditions may become ripe.
*S)S)S)As a result, we can avoid combining a verb withan irrelevant noun as its collocate as ?have towardcountry?
in (1) or ?think ?
people?
in (2).
Whenthe sentences in the corpus are annotated with thechunk and clause information, we canconsequently extract collocations more precisely.2.2 Collocation Type ExtractionA large set of collocation candidates can beobtained from BNC, via the process of integratingchunk and clause information.
We here considerthree prevalent Verb-Noun collocation structuresin corpus: VP+NP, VP+PP+NP, and VP+NP+PP.Exploiting Logarithmic Likelihood Ratio (LLR)statistics, we can calculate the strength ofassociation between two collocates.
Thecollocational type with threshold higher than 7.88(confidence level 99.5%) will be kept as one entryin our collocation type list.2.3 Collocation Instance IdentificationWe subsequently identify collocation instancesin the bilingual corpus (SPC) with the collocationtypes extracted from BNC in the previous step.Making use of the sequence of chunk types, weagain single out the adjacent structures of VN,VPN, and VNP.
With the help of chunk and clauseinformation, we thus find the valid instances wherethe expected collocation types are located, so as tobuild a collocational concordance.
Moreover, thequantity and quality of BNC also facilitate thecollocation identification in another smallerbilingual corpus with better statistic measure.English sentence Chinese sentenceIf in this time no oneshows concern for them,and directs them tocorrect thinking, andteaches them how toexpress and releaseemotions, this could veryeasily leave them with aterrible personalitycomplex they can neverresolve.??????????????????????????????????????????????????

We firstlocate the translation of the noun.
Subsequently,we locate the verb nearest to the noun translationto find the translation for the verb.
We can think ofcollocation with corresponding translations as akind of translation memory (shows in Table 2).Theimplementation result of BNC and SPC shows inthe Table 3, 4, and 5.3 Collocation ConcordanceWith the collocation types and instancesextracted from the corpus, we built an onlinecollocational concordancer called TANGO forlooking up translation memory.
A user can type inany English query and select the intended part ofspeech of query and collocate.
For example inFigure 1, after query for the verb collocates of thenoun ?influence?
is submitted, the results aredisplayed on the return page.
The user can thenbrowse through different collocates types and alsoclick to get to see all the instances of a certaincollocation type.Noun VN typesLanguage 320Influence 319Threat 222Doubt 199Crime 183Phone 137Cigarette 121Throat 86Living 79Suicide 47Table 4: Examples of collocation types includinga given noun  in BNCVN type ExampleExertinfluenceThat means they wouldalready be exerting theirinfluence by the time themicrowave background wasborn.ExerciseinfluenceThe Davies brothers, Adrian(who scored 14 points) andGraham (four), exercised animportant creative influenceon Cambridge fortunes whiletheir flankers Holmes andPool-Jones were full of fireand tenacity in the loose.WieldinfluenceFortunately, George V hadworked well with his fatherand knew the nature of thecurrent political trends, but hedid not wield the sameinfluence internationally as hisesteemed father.Table 5: Examples of collocation instancesextracted from SPCMoreover, using the technique of bilingualcollocation alignment and sentence alignment, thesystem will display the target collocation withhighlight to show translation equivalents in con-text.
Translators or learners, through this web-based interface, can easily acquire the usage ofeach collocation with relevant instances.
Thiscollocational concordancer is a very useful tool forself-inductive learning tailored to intermedi-ate oradvanced English learners.Users can obtain the result of the VN or ANcollocations related to their query.
TANGO showsthe collocation types and instances withcollocations and translation counterparts high-lighted.The evaluation (shows in Table 6) indicates anaverage precision of 89.3 % with regard tosatisfactory.4 Conclusion and Future WorkIn this paper, we describe an algorithm thatemploys linguistic and statistical analyses toextract instance of VN collocations from a verylarge corpus; we also identify the correspondingtranslations in a parallel corpus.
The algorithm isapplicable to other types of collocations withoutbeing limited by collocation?s span.
The maindifference between our algorithm and previouswork lies in that we extract valid instances insteadof types, based on linguistic information of chunksand clauses.
