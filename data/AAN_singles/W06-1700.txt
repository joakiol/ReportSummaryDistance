His results ledthe field.
He was in a privileged position to have access to a corpus of that size.
He works atGoogle.With enormous data, you get better results.
(See e.g.
Banko and Brill 2001.)
It seems to usthere are two possible responses for the academic NLP community.
The first is to acceptdefeat: ?we will never have resources on the scale Google has, so we should accept that oursystems will not really compete, that they will be proofs-of-concept or deal with nicheproblems, but will be out of the mainstream of high-performance HLT system development.
?The second is to say: we too need to make resources on this scale available, and they shouldbe available to researchers in universities as well as behind corporate firewalls: and we can doit, because resources of the right scale are available, for free, on the web.
We shall of coursehave to acquire new expertise along the way ?
at, inter alia, WAC workshops.Text typeThe most interesting question that the use of web corpora raises is text type.
(We use ?texttype?
as a cover-all term to include domain, genre, style etc.)
The first question about webcorpora from an outsider is usually ?how do you know that your web corpus isrepresentative??
to which the fitting response is ?how do you know whether any corpus isrepresentative (of what?)?.
These questions will only receive satisfactory answers when wehave a fuller account of how to identify and distinguish different kinds of text.While text type is not centre-stage in this volume, we suspect it will be prominent indiscussions at the workshop and will be the focus of papers in future workshops.The WWW community: links, web-as-graph, and linguisticsOne of CL?s academic neighbours is the WWW community (as represented by, eg, theWWW conference series).
Many of their key questions concern the nature of the web,viewing it as a large set of domains, or as a graph, or as a bag of bags of words.
The web issubstantially a linguistic object, and there is potential for these views of the web contributingto our linguistic understanding.
For example, the graph structure of the web has been used toidentify highly connected areas which are ?web communities?.
How does that graph-theoretical connectedness relate to the linguistic properties one would associate with adiscourse community?
To date the links between the communities have been not been strong.
(Few WWW papers are referenced in CL papers, and vice versa.)
The workshops willprovide a venue where WWW and CL interests intersect.vRecent work by co-chairs and colleaguesAt risk of abusing chairs?
privilege, we briefly mention two pieces of our own work.
In thefirst we have created web corpora of over 1 billion words for German and Italian.
The texthas been de-duplicated, passed through a range of filters, part-of-speech tagged, lemmatized,and loaded into a web-accessible corpus query tool supporting a wide range of linguists?queries.
It offers one model of how to use the web as a corpus.
The corpora will bedemonstrated in the main EACL conference (Baroni and Kilgarriff 2006).In the second, WebBootCaT (work with Jan Pomikalek and Pavel Rychl?
of MasarykUniversity, Brno), we have prepared a version of the BootCaT tools (Baroni and Bernardini2004) as a web service.
Users fill in a web form with the target language and some ?seedterms?
to specify the domain of the target corpus, and press the ?Build Corpus?
button.
Acorpus is built.
Thus, people without any programming or software-installation skills cancreate corpora to their own specification.
The system will be demonstrated in the ?demos?session of the workshop.The workshop series to dateThis is the second international workshop, the first being held in July 2005 in Birmingham,UK (in association with Corpus Linguistics 2005).
There was an earlier Italian event in Forl?,in January 2005.
All three have attracted high levels of interest.
The papers in this volumewere selected following a highly competitive review process, and we would like to thank allthose who submitted, all those on the programme committee who contributed to the reviewprocess, and the additional reviewers who helped us to get through the large number ofsubmissions.
Special thanks to Stefan Evert for help with assembling the proceedings.
(Cafarella and Etzioni have an abstract rather than a full paper to avoid duplicate publication:we felt their presentation would make an important contribution to the workshop, which was adistinct issue to them not having a new text available.
)We are confident that there will be much of interest for anyone engaged with NLP and theweb.ReferencesBanko, M. and E. Brill.
