An extension of the CategorialGrammar is introduced to treat the fiee word-order in Korean.
The table-driven control ofinteractive relaxation gives efficiency inconstituent searching and expectationgeneration.
'File lexical nature of theCategorial Grammar and the distributednature of the interactive relaxation parsingtogether show a smooth integration of bothbottom-up and toFdown effects during thespoken language analysis.1.
IntroductionSpoken language input may be one of the mostpreferred interface with computer systems ifspeech can be well integrated with the naturallanguage processing.There have been a few attempts to integratespeech recognition with Ihe natural languageunderstanding.
(Hayes 1986) adopted the caseframe instantiation technique to parsecontinuously spoken English sentences given inthe form of a word lattice (a set of word candidateshypothesized by a speech recognition module)and t)roduced a frame representation of thet l t terence.
(Pocsio 1987) suggested a modified caseframcparsing to parse a word latlice in Italian.
(Lee,, L.S.
1987) developed a prototype Chinese(Mandarin) dictation machine which takes asyllable lattice and produces a Chinese charactersequence.
(Saito 1991) used GLR technique toparse a sequence of Japanese phonenms and,integrated wilh the tlMM technique, developed aHMM-I.R parser (Kita 1991).lh)wever,  spoken Korean has manydistinguished characteristics compared withspoken English and even with spoken Japanese,for example, comlpe?
word formation,phonological changes and irregular conjugations.In this paper, we present a CYK-table driveninteractive relaxation parsing method of spokenKorean, integrated with the CYK-basedinorphological analysis.
A Korean phoneme latticeis assumed as input and the CYK-basedmorphological analysis copes with the difficultiesof complex word formation, phonological changesand irregular conjugations.
Categorial Gralnmar isadapted and extended to treat the free word-orderin Korean and the CYK-tablc driven interactiverelaxation parsing gives et'ficicncy beyond thegeneral interactive relaxation parsing methodssuch as (Howclls t988; Nijholt 1990).2.
Features of spoken KoreanKorean, a SOV and an agghmating language,has the following characteristics:1) A Korean word, Eojeol, consists of more thanone ntorphemes with clear-cut boundaries inbetween.
For example, an Eojeol "pka .
i l -du l -ul(fiies\[objl)" consists of 3 ,norl~hemes:pha-il = il + dul + ulfilcslobjl file \[pl.
suffix\] \[obj markerl2) Korean is a postposifional language with noun-endings, verb-endings and prefinal verb-endings.These functional morphemes determine the noun'scase role, verb's tense, modality, and modificationrelations between phrases.
For example, in "e-ceypha- i l ( the  file :i~:~: :.:,.
:: ~ii!~i :~:~ yesterday)" the verb "swu-ceng (edit)" is ofpast tense and modifies "pha il (file)":su-ceng-ha yess ten pha-iledit \[past\] \[adnominal\] file3) Korean has relatively fi'ce word order comparedto SVO hmguages, such as English.
For example,the sentence ~ ~ ~-ha-vess - tenpha- i l - tu l -u l / tn~pok-sa -ha-ye- la  (Copy thefiles that was edited by me yesterday to /trap.
)"may be written as"e-cey.
na!~dca swu-cen~ess - ten  " or"~10 e-cey_ naok-ka swu-cen ,-hgzhaeyess-ten .., .
"911Besides these characteristics of written Korean,spoken Korean has the fol lowing morecharacteristics:4) The unit of pause in a speech (Eonjeol) may bedifferent from that of a written text (Eojeol).
Forexample, in speaking "nay-ka e-cey swu-ceng-ha-yess-ten phaoil-tul-ul ~trap lo pok-sa-ha-ye-la(spaces delimit Eojeols), a person may pause after"nay-ka" and after "e-cey swu-ceng-ha-yess-tenpha-il-tul-ul" and after "~trap lo pok-sa-ha-ye-la.
"5) Phonological changes occur in a morpheme,between morphemes in an Eojeol, and betweenEojeols in an Eonjeol.
These changes includeassimilation, dissimilation, and contraction.
Forexample, a morpheme "pok-sa" is pronounced as/pok-ssa/ and "yess" is pronounced as /yet/.
AnEojeol "su-ceng-ha-yess-ten" is pronounced as/su-ceng-ha-yet-tten/.3.
Table driven neural syntactic analysisThis section explains interactive relaxationparsing of spoken Korean using neural network,its underlying rammar, and control mechanism.A sequence of candidate phonemes inphoneme lattice \[figure 1\] is assumed to be theoutput of the speech recognizer.\[Figure 1.
Phoneme lattice\]A CYK-based morphological analyzer is usedto extract a morpheme lattice from the phonemelattice.
In the morphological analysis, specialprocedural attachments resolve the phonologicalchanges.
The use of phoneme lattice gives theproblem of exponential number of Eonjeolcandidates.
For this problem, trie data structure isused for the phonetic transcr ipt ion-to-orthographic morpheme dictionary (morpheme-level phonetic dictionary).3.1.
Extending the Categorial GrammarTo model the syntax of Korean, we extendedthe Categorial Grammar in two ways (Zeevat1988; Uszkoreit 1986).A (directional) Categorial Grammar is anordered quintuple G = <V, C, S, R, f>, where1) V: the vocabulary set,2) C: a finite set of basic categories whichgenerates a full set C' of categories via recursiveapplication of the following category furmationrules:if a~ C, then a~ C' andif a~C' and b~ C', then a/b~ C' and akbc C',3) S: the category for sentences,4) R: a set of functional application rules such asleft cancellation ?
A B\A __> Bright cancellation" B/A A _.> B5) f: an assignment flmction from elements of Vinto the subsets of C'.To treat the free word-order in Korean, weextended the category formation rules and theapplication rules:2') Extended category formation rules:i fa~C, then a~C'  andi fa~C'  and ScC ' ,  then a/s~ C' and a~ C' and4') Extended functional application rules :left cancellation :Ai I~{AI,...,An}-> ~{Al,...,Ai-l,Ai+l,...,Atl}right cancellation :B/{AI,...,An} Ai --> B/{AI,...,Ai_ l,Ai+l,...,An}3.2.
Interactive relaxation parsing(Howells 1988) developed an interactiverelaxation parsing method which used a dynamicnetwork building scheme, and decay over timewith competition instead of explicit inhibitorylinks, which is similar to the (Reggia 1987)'sapproach.The interactive relaxation algorithm consists ofthe following steps (Howells 1988): 1) add nodes,2) spread actiwltion and 3) decay.
Bottom-upinformation gathering and top-down expectationsoccur during the parsing.1) to add a node:A grammar node is added tot" each sense ofmorphemes when the parsing begins.
Statisticalinformation on the senses of a morphemedetermines the initial activation value of thesenses .A grammar node which has more activationthan the predefined threshold 6) makes new nodes(expectations).
The newly generated nodesrepresent candidate parse trees containing thegenerator node.9122) to spread actiwltion:A predefined portion, P,  of a node's totalactivation, A, is passed upward, to bigger parsetrees.
When more than one destination odes exist,they compete to get more actiwttions.
A highernode with actiwltion a i gets the following amountof actiw~tions:.2~11AxPx  g ~ aJ zA higher level node (with total actiwltion A)spreads a prcdefined portion (Q) of its actiwltionwdue equally to the constituents.
When there are nconstituents, a constituent gets the fol lowingamount o1' activations:1AxQx-  -n3) to decay:A llOde's actiwttion value (A) after decay is Atimes (1 D), where I) is the decay ratio.Moreover, a node with less constituents thanneeded is penalized by the number of actualconst ituents (Ca) divided by the numher ofrequired constituents (Cr).
After all, a node'sactivation value changed toCaA x (1 1)) x - -CrAnd finally a node whose actiwttion value isless than the predefmed threshold ?
is removed.3.3.
CYK- tab le -dr iven  contro lThe interactive relaxation parsing scheme(Howells 1988) lacks efficient control structuresfor const ituent searching and expectat iongenerat ion.
We provided the pos i t iona linformation through the CYK-tablc and thestructuring information through the CategorialGrammar formalism.
Using Categorial Grammarmakes the parse tree be a binary tree, not a generaln-ary tree.All the grammar nodes reside in a CYK-table.The position (i,j) in the table explicitly says whereto find the constituents, where to add newexpectations and what the uode there stands for.A node in CYK(i,j) represents a parse tree forthe input segmeut from i to j.
A node in CYK(i,j)with category P, called P(i,j), can be nsed in 3 waysto construct larger parse trees:1) Q/p(k,i-l) P(i,j) --> Q(k,j) orP(i,j) Q~p(j+l,k) --> Q(i,k).P(i,j) combins with Q/p(k,i- l)for some k < i andbecomes a constituent of Q(k,j).
Or it combins withQ\p( j+ l ,k )  for some k > j and becomes aconstituent of Q(i,k).
In these two cases P(i,j) isused as an argument of the limctional categories.2) A/B(i,j) B0+l,k ) --> A(i,k).P(i,j) combines B( j+l,k)  for some k > j andcreates a larger parse tree A(i,k), when P = A/B.
Inthis case, P(i,j) is a flmctional category A/B andsearches ti)r an argument B on the right side.3) B(k,i-1) AkB(i,j) --> A(k,j).P(i,j) combines B(k, i - l )  for some k < i  andcreates A(k,j) , when P=A\ B.
In this case, P(i,j) is afunctional category A\  B and searches for anargument B on the left side.0 1 2 3 4\[Figure 2.
A/B( l,l)'s expectation generation\]The following scenarios can explain the CYK-table driven interactive relaxation parsing ofKorean.A node A/B(i,j) whose actiwltion wdue is greaterthan the threshold (0 makes new nodes (A(i,k)'s forall j < k < input-length), and each A(i,k) looks for aconstituent B(j+l,k).
\[Figure 2\] shows A/B(I , I) 'sexpectation generations.
There are 3 possible A'swhich can have A/B(1,1 ) as their constituents:A(I,2), A(I,3) and A(1,4).
A(I,2) looks for 1/(2,2),A(I,3) for B(2,3), and A(1,4) for B(2,4).Synnnetrically, a node A\B(i,j) whose activationvalue is greater than the threshold O makes newnodes (A(k,j)'s for all 0 < k < i) and each A(k,j)looks for a constituent B(k,i-l).Only the nodes with enough actiw~tionsgenerate hypotheses, and the hypotheses whichlack of constituents disappear rapidly by thedecay with penalty mechanism.
Each node(hypothesis) which looks for a constituent drives913the parsing, and the efficiency of the constituentsearching is guaranteed by the CYK-table.
We callthe parsing technique as Connectionist-CYKparsing.4.
System architectureThe Connectionist-CYK parser is incorporatedinto the DINX (Dialog Interface to UNIX) systemwhich is under development in POSTECH (Lee,W.
I. and Lee, G.B.
1993).
\[Figure 3\] shows thepart of D1NX system architecture.

Speech parser architecture\]A phoneme lattice for each Eonjeol is analyzedby an extension of the CYK-based morphologicalanalyzer (Lee, E. C. 1992).
The result of theanalysis is a morpheme lattice (see \[Figure 4\]) foreach Eonjeol.
These morpheme lattices are linked,and the morpheme lattice for entire sentence isconstructed.
Grammar nodes for the senses ofeach morpheme are created in the CYK-table andthe following four steps are repeated for a fixednumber of iterations: 1) making hypotheses (newnodes), 2) constituent searching, 3) computingout-going activations and 4) updating activationvalues.
Functional category nodes A/B(i,j) andA\B(i,j) whose activation values are greater than thethreshold generate the expectations A(i,k)'s andA(k,j)'s respectively.
All the hypotheses (nodeswhich lack of a constituent) search for theirconstituents.
Outgoing bottom-up and top-downactivations are computed for each node.
Eachnode gathers incoming activations and decays.5.
Sample  runIn this section, a detailed example of theConnectionist-CYK parsing is given.
The systemparameters are as follows: bottom-up activationratio P = 0.87, top-down activation ratio Q = 0.39,decay ratio D = 0.495, expectation threshold ?
=6.66 and remove threshold ?
= 0.66.The sentence "ci-wul su iss-nun pha-il-dul-ulpo-ye-la (List the files which can be removed.)"
isassumed to be spoken with two pauses, "ci-wul suiss-nun / pha-il-dul-ul / po-ye-la."
\]Figure 1\]showed the first phoneme lattice of the three.The phoneme lattices are analyzed one by one,and a morpheme lattice for the sentence is createdby merging the morpheme lattice for eachEonjeol \]Figure 4\].\[Figure 4.

Themorpheme lattice is embedded in the CYK-table,and the senses of each morpheme are created inthe corresponding position in the table.
Each nodcwith functional category generates hypotheses,and each hypothesis searches for thcirconstituents.
After the 1-st iteration, 209 nodes arein the table.
The number of nodes change to 282,302, 289, and 265 along the iterations.
After 6-thiteration, the number of nodes decreases to 253,and the correct parse tree for the whole morphemelatticc is created (\[Figure 5 (b)\] shows a part of theparse tree).

Conclusions and future worksIn this paper we have developed a CYK-table-driven interactive relaxation parsing method(CCYK parsing) of spoken Korean, integrated withthe CYK-based morphological nalysis.We have shown that the partially free wordorder and the postpositions are easily andnaturally encoded by the Extended CategorialGrammar.
The use of Categorial Grammar withthe interactive relaxation parsing results in alexical-based, locally distributed and island-drivenparsing.
A node generates hypotheses if it gathersenough bottom-up activation (evidence) and eachhypothesis locally searches for constituents, l)ecaywith penalty removes failed and incorrecthypotheses.The use of the phoneme lattice and themorpheme lattice removes the redundancy inpostprocessing and parsing of spoken Korean, andmakes the whole interactions among thephonemes and morphemes possible.
Theactivation value of parses gives a clue to theselection of the best parse.
The statisticalinformation between senses of morphemes canmake the selection more reliable.
As noted in(Howells 1988), changing the system parametersgives the flexibility of retaining the alternatives.We can have all the parses in one setting and canhave only the best parse on the another settingdepending on the application.
We plan to add theunification ability for semantic analysis to ourwork, and finally develop a connectionist parsingmethod for the full Categorial UnificationGrammar.ReferencesHayes, P. J. , Hauptmann, A. G. et al (1986).Parsing spoken language: A semantic aseframeapproach.
