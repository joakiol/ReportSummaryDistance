We usemachine learning classification using lexi-cal, word ending and dictionary-based fea-tures, with linear support vector machinesand random forests.
We find that lexicalfeatures are the most helpful.1 IntroductionText dating, or determination of the time periodwhen it was written, proves to be a useful com-ponent in NLP systems that can deal with suchdiachronistically dynamic inputs (Moura?o et al2008).
Besides this, the models that can performsuch classification can shine light on less than ob-vious changes of certain features.The knowledge captured in such systems canprove useful in transferring modern language re-sources and tools to historical domains (Meyer,2011).
Automatic translation systems betweenand across language stages, as in the corpus in-troduced by (Magaz, 2006), can benefit from theidentification of feature variation over time.In this paper we study the problem of super-vised temporal text classification across genresand authors.
The problem turns out to be solvableto a very high degree of accuracy.2 Related WorkThe influence of the temporal effects in automaticdocument classification is analyzed in (Moura?o etal., 2008) and (Salles et al 2010).
The authorsstate that a major challenge in building text clas-sification models may be the change which occursin the characteristics of the documents and theirclasses over time (Moura?o et al 2008).
There-fore, in order to overcome the difficulties whicharise in automatic classification when dealing withdocuments dating from different epochs, identify-ing and accounting for document characteristicschanging over time (such as class frequency, rela-tionships between terms and classes and the sim-ilarity among classes over time (Moura?o et al2008)) is essential and can lead to a more accuratediscrimination between classes.In (Dalli and Wilks, 2006) a method for clas-sification of texts and documents based on theirpredicted time of creation is successfully applied,proving that accounting for word frequencies andtheir variation over time is accurate.
In (Kumaret al 2012) the authors argue as well for the ca-pability of this method, of using words alone, todetermine the epoch in which a text was written orthe time period a document refers to.The effectiveness of using models for individu-als partitions in a timeline with the purpose of pre-dicting probabilities over the timeline for new doc-uments is investigated in (Kumar et al 2011) and(Kanhabua and N?rva?g, 2009).
This approach,based on the divergence between the languagemodel of the test document and those of the time-line partitions, was successfully employed in pre-dicting publication dates and in searching for webpages and web documents.In (de Jong et al 2005) the authors raise theproblem of access to historical collections of doc-uments, which may be difficult due to the differ-ent historical and modern variants of the text, theless standardized spelling, words ambiguities and102other language changes.
Thus, the linking of cur-rent word forms with their historical equivalentsand accurate dating of texts can help reduce thetemporal effects in this regard.Recently, in (Mihalcea and Nastase, 2012), theauthors introduced the task of identifying changesin word usage over time, disambiguating the epochat word-level.3 Approach3.1 Datasets usedIn order to investigate the diachronic changes andvariations in the Romanian lexicon over time, weused copora from five different stages in the evo-lution of the Romanian language, from the 16thto the 20th century.
The 16th century representsthe beginning of the Romanian writing.
In (Dim-itrescu, 1994, p. 13) the author states that the mod-ern Romanian vocabulary cannot be completelyunderstood without a thorough study of the textswritten in this period, which should be consid-ered the source of the literary language used to-day.
In the 17th century, some of the most im-portant cultural events which led to the develop-ment of the Romanian language are the improve-ment of the education system and the establish-ing of several printing houses (Dimitrescu, 1994,p.
75).
According to (Lupu, 1999, p. 29), inthe 18th century a diversification of the philologi-cal interests in Romania takes place, through writ-ing the first Romanian-Latin bilingual lexicons,the draft of the first monolingual dictionary, thefirst Romanian grammar and the earliest transla-tions from French.
The transition to the Latin al-phabet, which was a significant cultural achieve-ment, is completed in the 19th century.
The Cyril-lic alphabet is maintained in Romanian writinguntil around 1850, afterwards being gradually re-placed with the Latin alphabet (Dimitrescu, 1994,p.
270).
The 19th century is marked by the conflict(and eventually the compromise) between etymol-ogism and phonetism in Romanian orthography.In (Maiorescu, 1866) the author argues for apply-ing the phonetic principle and several reforms areenforced for this purpose.
To represent this pe-riod, we chose the journalism texts of the leadingRomanian poet Mihai Eminescu.
He had a cru-cial influence on the Romanian language and hiscontribution to modern Romanian development ishighly appreciated.
In the 20th century, some vari-ations regarding the usage of diacritics in Roma-nian orthography are noticed.Century Corpus Nwordstype token16Codicele Todorescu 3,799 15,421Codicele Martian 394 920Coresi, Evanghelia cu ??nva?t?a?tura?

We handled word bound-aries and lower-cased all words.
We computed,for each text in our corpora, the number of words(type and token).
The results are listed in Table1.
For identifying words from our corpora in dic-tionaries, we performed lemmatization.
The in-formation provided by the machine-readable dic-tionary dexonline 1 regarding inflected forms al-lowed us to identify lemmas (where no semanticor part-of-speech ambiguities occurred) and to fur-ther lookup the words in the dictionaries.
In ourinvestigations based on dexonline we decided touse the same approach as in (Mihalcea and Nas-tase, 2012) and to account only for unambiguouswords.
For example, the Romanian word ai ismorphologically ambiguous, as we identified twocorresponding lemmas: avea (verb, meaning tohave) and ai (noun, meaning garlic).
The wordama?nare is semantically ambiguous, having twodifferent associated lemmas, both nouns: ama?nar(which means flint) and ama?na (which means topostpone).
We do not use the POS information di-1http://dexonline.ro103rectly, but we use dictionary occurrence featuresonly for unambiguous words.The database of dexonline aggregates informa-tion from over 30 Romanian dictionaries from dif-ferent periods, from 1929 to 2012, enabling us toinvestigate the diachronic evolution of the Roma-nian lexicon.
We focused on four different sub-features:?
words marked as obsolete in dexonline defi-nitions (we searched for this tag in all dictio-naries)?
words which occur in the dictionaries of ar-chaisms (2 dictionaries)?
words which occur in the dictionaries pub-lished before 1975 (7 dictionaries)?
words which occur in the dictionaries pub-lished after 1975 (31 dictionaries)As stated before, we used only unambiguouswords with respect to the part of speech, in order tobe able to uniquely identify lemmas and to extractthe relevant information.

For the best feature sets, denotedwith an asterisk in table 3, the test results and hy-perparameter settings are presented in tables 4 and5.The results show that the nonlinear nature ofthe random forest classifier is important when us-ing feature sets so different in nature.
However, alinear SVM can perform comparably, using onlythe most important features.
The misclassifica-tions that do occur are not between very distantcenturies.5 ConclusionsWe presented two classification systems, a linearSVM one and a nonlinear random forest one, forsolving the temporal text classification problem onRomanian texts.
