NATURAL LANGUAGE TEXT SEGMENTATION TECHNIQUES APPLIED TO THEAUTOMATIC COMPILATION OF PRINTED SUBJECT INDEXES AND FOR ONLINE DATABASE ACCESSG.
Vladu=zInstitute for Scientific Information3501 Market S~reet, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104 USAABSTRACTThe nature of the problem and earlier approachesto the automatic compilation of printed subjectindexes are reviewed and illustrated.
A simplemethod is described for the de~ection of semanticallyself-contained word phrase segments in title-liketexts.
The method is based on a predetermined listof acceptable types of nominative syntactic patternswhich can be recognized using a small domain-indepen-dent dictionary.
The transformation of the de~ectedword phrases into subject index records is described.The records are used for ~he compilation of Key WordPhrase subJec= indexes (K~PSI).
The me~hod has beensuccessfully tested for the fully automaticproduction of KWPSI-type indexes to titles ofscientific publications.
The usage of KWPSI-typedisplay forma~s for the~enhanced online access todatabases is also discussed.i.
The problem o~f automatic compilation ofsubject indexesPrinted subject indexes (SI), such asback-of-the-book indexes and indexes to periodicalsand abstracts journals remain important as the mostcommon tools for information retrieval.
Tradition-ally SI are compiled from subject descriptionsproduced for this purpose by human indexers.
Suchsubject descriptions are usually nominalizedsentences in which the word order is chosen toemphasize as theme one of the objects participatingin the description; the corresponding word or wordphrase is placed at the beginning of the nominativeconstruction.
Furthermore, the nominalized sentenceis rendered in a specially transformed('articulated') way involving the separated by commasdisplay of component word phrases together with thedominating prepositions; e.g.
the sentence 'In lemonjuice lead (is) determined by atomic absorptionspectrometry' becomes 'LEMON JUICE, leaddetermination in, by atomic absorption spectroscopy.
'Such rendering enhances the speedy understanding ofthe descriptions when browsing the index.
At thesame time it creates for the subject ~escriptiona llneary ordered sequence of focuses which can beused for the hierarchical multilevel groupingof related sets of descriptions.
The main focus(theme) serves for the grouping of descriptions undera corresponding subject heading, the secondaryfocuses make possible the further subdivision of suchgroup by subheadings.

A text processing problem,studied in connection with the compilation of such siof traditional type, was the automatic transformationof subject descriptions for selecting their differentpossible themes and focuses (Armitage, 1967).
Anexperimental procedure, not yet implemented, takes asinput pre-edited subject descriptions (Cohen, 1976).Since the generau ion  of subjec= descrip=ions byhuman indexers is a very expensive procedure P. Luhn(1959) of IBM has suggested replacing subject de-scriptions by titles provided by the publication'sauthors.
Using only a 'negative' dictionary of highfrequency words excluded from indexing, he designed aprocedure for the automatic compilation of listingswhere fragments of titles are displayed repeateuly136for  a l l  the i r  lndexable words, These words arealphabet ized and displayed on the pr in ted  page in thecentral position of a column; their contextualfragments are sorted according to the r ight -hand s ideCOntextS of the index words.
Such listings, calledKey-Word-ln-Context (ENIC) indexes, have beenproduced and successfully marketed since 1960"quick-a~d-dir ty"  $I, desp i te  the i r  'mechanical'appearance which makes them difficult enough to readand browse.
A fragment of KNIC index to "BiologicalAbst racts , "  featur ing  t i t les  enriched by addi t ion~lkey words is shown in figure 2.~o~co~/41~ ~ t  awn~we ~Figure 2.Fragment of a Key-Nord-in-Context (KNIt) typesubject index to "~iological Abst racts , "automatically compiled from titles ofbiological publicaclons, The blank sparsereplace the repeated occurrences of ~he keyword appearing above.Another mechanically compiled SI substitutestill in current use is based on a similar idea andsimply groups together all the titles concaining asame indexable word.
Such Key-Word-out-of-Context(~WOC) indexes display the full texts of titles undera common beading.
Figure 3 shows a KWOC samplegenerated from title-Like subject descr ip t ions  ac theI ns t i tu te  for Sc ient i f i c  Information, The appearanceof KWOC indexes is more steep,abe but their bro~elngis much hindered by the lack of articulation of theLengthy subject descriptions (titles).
Withoutproper articulation, the recognition of the contextimmediately relevant to  the index word becomes tooslow.In 1966 the Institute for Scientific Information( IS I )  introduced a different type of automaticallycompiled subject index called PERMUTERM Subject Index(PSI) OGarfieid, 19760, which at present is the maintype of SI to the Science Cltation Index and othersimilar ISI publications.
Two different negativedictionaries are used for producing ~his SI: a socalled "full stop list" of words excluded frombecoming headings as well as from being used assubordinate index entries, and a "semi- stop List" of~ords of little informative value, which are noCallowed as headings but are used as index entriesalong with words ~ound neither in the full-stop uorin ~he semi-stop Lists.

The arrows indicate the firstoccurrence under the given heading of a pointer togiven article.137PSI has the unique ability to make possible theeasy retrieval of all titles containing any givenpair of informative words.
This ability is similarto the ability of computerized online search systemsto retrieve titles by any boolean combination ofsearch terms.
The corresponding PSI ability isavailable to PSI users who have been instructed aboutthe principles used for compiling it.
The naive useris more likely to utilize it as a browsing tool.When doing so, he may be inclined to perceive thesubordinate word entries as being the immediatecontext of the headings.
Used as a browsing tool,PSI may deliver relatively high percentage of falsedrops because of the lack of contextual information.Another shortcoming of the PSI is its relatively highcost due to its significant size which is propor-tional to the square of the average length of titles.The large number of entries subordinated to headingswhich are words of relatively high frequency makesthe exhaustive scanning of entries under suchheadings a time consumLing procedure.An important advantage of all the above computergenerated indexes over their manually compiledcounterparts is the speed and essentially lower costat which they are made available.All the above compilation procedures are basedexclusively on the most trivial facts concerning thesyntaxis and semantics of natural languages.
Theymake use of the fact that texts are built of words,of the existence of words having purely syntacticfunctions and of the existence of lexlcal units ofvery little informative value.
A common disadvantageversus the SI of traditional type is that the aboveprocedures fall to provide articulated contextswhich would be short enough and structurally simpleenough to be easily 8rasped in the course ofbrowsing.Certainly this problem can be solved by anysysten which can perform the full syntactic analysisof titles or similar kinds of subject descriptions.From the syntactic tree of the title a briefarticulated context can be produced for any givenword of a title by detecting a subtree of suitablesize which includes the given word.
However, in themajority of cases the practical conditions ofapplication of index compilation procedures areexcluding the usage of full scale syntactic analysis,based on dictionaries containing the requiredmorphological, syntactic and semantic information forall the lexical units of the processed input.
Forinstance, ISI is processing annually for its mutli-disciplinary publications around 700,000 titlesranging in their subject orientation from science andtechnology to arts and humanities.
The effort neededfor the creation and maintenance of dictionariescovering several hundred thousands entries with ahigh ratio of appearance of new words would beexcessive.
Therefore, the automatic compilation ofSI is practially feasible only on the basis of quitesimplistic procedures based on "negative" dic-tionaries involving approximative methods of analysiswhich yield good results in ~he majority of cases,but are robust enough not to break down even indifficult cases.At one end of the range of problems involvingnatural language processsing are such as questionanswering which require a high degree of analyticsophistication and are based on a significant amountof domain dependent information formated in bulkylexicons.
Such procedures appear to be applicable totexts dealing with rather narrow fields of knowledgein the same way as the high levels of iu-depth humanexpertise are usually limited to specific domains.On the other end of the spectrum are simple problemsrequiring much less domain dependent information andrelatively low levels of "intelligence" (oefined asthe ability to discuss comprehensive texts fromgibberish); the corresponding procedures are usuallyapplicable to wide categories of texts.
For reasonsexplained above, we consider the problems ofautomatic compilation of subject indexes as belongin~to this low end of the spectrum.2.
The automatic compilation of  Key-Word-Phrase Sub~ect IndexesIn this framework we developed an automaticprocedure for the compilaclon of a SI based on :hedetection and usage of word phrases.
The earlierstages of development of this Key-Word-Phrase subjectindex (KW?SI) have been reported elsewhere (Vladutz19795.
The procedure starts by detecting certaintypes of syntactically self-contained segments of theinput text; such segments are expected to besemantically self-contained in view of the assumedwell-formedness of the input.
The segment detectionprocedure is based on a relatively short list ofacceptable syntactic patterns, formulated in terms ofmarkers attributable by a simple dictionary look-up.The markers are essentially ~he same as used in(Klein 1963) in the early days of machine translationfor automatic grammatical coding of English words.All the words not found in an exlusion dictionary of"~ 1,500 words are assigned the two markers ADJand NOUN.
All the acceptable syntactic patterns arecharacterized in the frameworks of a generativegr=--,~r constructed for title-type texts.
Sucn textsare described as sequences of segments of acceptablesyntactic patterns separated by arbitrary fillersegments whose syntactic pattern is different fromthe acceptable ones.
The analysis procedure leadingto the detection of acceptable segments wasformulated as a reversal of the generative grammarand is performed by a right =o left scanning.
.~ewacceptable syntactic patterns can easily beincorporated into the generative grammar.
It isenvisaged to use in the future existing programs forautomatically generating analysis programs from anyspecific variant of the grammar.The present list of acceptable syntacticpatterns includes such patterns where nounphrases are concatenated by the preposition 'OF' anuthe conjunctions 'AND', 'OR', 'AND/OR', as well asconstructions of the type 'NPI, NP2, ... ANDNPi'.
Since no prepositions other than 'OF' and noconjunctions other than 'AND', 'OR', 'AND/OR' canoccur in the acceptable segments the occurrences ofother prepositions and conjunctions are used forinitial delimitation of acceptable segments, butthe detection procedure is not limited to such usage.In particular, a past participle or a groupcontaining adve-bs followed by a past participle areexcluded from the acceptable segment when preceuing138an initial delimiter.
The segmentation detection isillustrated for three titles in figure 5.A) SPREADING OF VIRUS INFECTION among WILDBIRDS And MONKEYS during INFLUENZAEPIDEMIC C a u s ?

The words with all lowercase letters areprepositions and conjunctions used as initialdeli~Liters.
The words with only initial capitalletters are "seml-stop" words, excluded from beingused as  index  head ings ;  the  underscored  by dot tedlines "seml-stops" are past participles which becomedellminters only when followed by initial dellmi~ars.The resulting multl-word phrases are underscored~wice unlike the resultlng single word phrases whichare  underscored  once.The first part of the system's dictionary con-Junctions, prepositions, articles, auxiliary verbsand pronouns.
Th/s part is completely domainindependent.
A second par t  of the dictionaryconsists of nouns, adjectives, verbs, present andpast participles, all of them of little informativevalue and, therefore, called "seml-stop" words.
Suchwords will not be allowtd later to become SIheadings.
The semi-stop par~ of the dictionary issomewhat domain-dependent and has to be atuned fordifferent broad fields of knowledge such as scienceand technology, social sciences or arts andhumanities.The second logical step in the SI compilationinvolves the transformation of acceptable segmentsinto index records consisting of an informative word(not found in the system's dictionary) displayed asheading llne and of an index llne providing somerelevant context for the headlng word.
Each multi-word segment generates as many index records as manyinformative words it contains.
The ri~ht-hand sideof the segment following the heading word is placedat the beginning of the index line to serve as itsi~nediate context and is followed through a senLicolonby the segment's left-hand side.
When both sides arenon-empty, an articulation of the index line is soachieved.
In the case of a single word segment an"expansion" procedure is performed during indexrecord generation.
It starts by placing at thebeginning of the index llne a fragment of the titleconsisting of the filler portion following theheading word and of the next acceptable segment, ifany; this initial portion of the index line isfollowed by a semicolon after which follows thepreceding acceptable segment, followed finally by thefiller portion separating in the title this precedingsegment from the heading word.
The index recordgeneration is illustrated in figure 6.139final "enrichment" phase of the indexrecord generatlon involves the additionaldisplay (in parenthesis) of the unused segmentsof the processed title.

The last two examples snow how singleword segments (from Title C) are expanded to incluoethe preceding and following them segemencs.As a result of this stage the informacioual value ofthe finally generated index record is almostequivalent to the information content of ~ne initialfull title.
The entire process ultimately boils downto the the reshuffling of some component segments ofthe initial title.
The enr ic~ent stage of indexrecord generation is illustrated on figure 7.The index records are alphabetized firstlyby heading words and secondly by index lineswith the exclusion from alphabetiza~ion ofprepositions and conjunctions if they occur aC thebeginning of index lines.
During thephotocomposition different parts of the indexline are set usin~ different fonts.
If in theoriginal title the initial part of the indexllne follows the head word i~nedlately thispart is set in bold face italics, i.e.
in thesame font as the heading.
The "inverted" partfollowing the semicolon is set in light face romanletters.
Finally the enrichment part of ~he indexline, included in patens is always displayed inlight-face italics.

Details of theappearance and s~ructure of KWPSI are exemplified infigure 8 on a sample compiled for titles of publica-tions dealing with librarianship and informationscience.
The general appearance of KWPSI is closeenough to the appearance of SI of traditional type.For purposes of transportability the KWPSIsystem is programmed in ANSA COBOL.
It includes twomodules: the index generation module and the sortingand reformatting module.
On an IBM 370 system indexrecords are generated for titles of scholarly papersat a speed of ~ 70,000 titles/hour.
The resultingtotal size of the index is of the same order as thesize of KWOC indexes and compares favorably with thesize of the PSI index.The analysis of ~he rates and ~aCure of failuresof ~he segment detection algorithm shows thatin 96% of cases the generated segments are fullyacceptable as valuable index entries.
In 2% ofcases some important information is lost as a resultof the elimination of prepositions, as in case ofexpressions of 'wood to wood' type.
The rest offailures results in somehow awkward segments whichare not completely semantically self-contained.
Evenin such cases the index entries retain someinformative value.
Around half of the failures canbe eliminated by additions to the system'sdictionary, especially by the inclusion of more verbsand past participles.
Not counted aS failures arethe 5% of cases when the leng=h of the detectedsegments is excessive; such segments can include thewhole title.The extent of tuning required for =heapplication of the system in a new area of knowledgedepends mainly upon ~he extent of figure 8.

As amatter of fact all kinds of scholarly titles containsuch deviations, as for instance portions of normaltext included in parentheses or occurrences ofmathematical or chemical symbols.
We found only onecase when the required tuning effort was siguifican~,namely the case of titles from ~he domain of arts andhumanities.
ISl's "Arts and Humanities Citation140I ndex"  includes besides ci~les of arclcles, alsocicles of book reviews, as well as descriptions ofmusical performances and musical records, compiledaccordin G co special rules.
Many contain mulciwordnames of works of arC, cakes in quotation marks,which have ~o be handled as single words.

This SI would bethen printed together with the full list of relevantitems.
It is ~hought that such kind of interactioncould be more user friendly than the currently usedboolean mode.Another way of using the KWPSI techniquein an online environment would be to use theKWPSI format for the output of the results of aretrieval performed in a traditional booleanway.
The query word which achieved the moststrong trimming effect would be used asheading.A third way would involve the compression of aKWFSI section under a given heading before it isdisplayed in response to a word.
One could e.g.retain only such noun phrases containing the givenword which occur at least k times in the database.An example of such list for the "Arts and Humanities"database is given in figure 12.
By displaying suchlists of words closely co- occurring with a given one~he system would perform thesaurus-type functions.The implementation of all suchpossibilities would be rather difficult for anyexistin 8 system in view of the effort requiredto reprocess past input.
Instead, after the input ofa query word the corresponding full text recordscould be called a not processed online in core forgenerating KWPSl-type index records.
In this caseall the above functions could be still performed.AFRICAN * HORROR(S) *AMERICAN * iNDUSTRYARCHIVES LITERARY *AVANT-GARDE * MAKER(S)BLACK * OBSCENE *BRAZILIAN * POLISH *COMPANY PRODDCTIONCRITICISM PROPAGANDADIRECTOR TECHNIQUESDOCUMENTARY * THEORYFESTIVAL(S) TV *HISTORY WESTERN *Figure 12Lie= of word phrases containing the word'FILM(S)' and appearing at least twice intitles covered during a three months period by\[SI's ARTS and HUMANITIES CITATION INDEA.
Suchautomatically compiled lists are suggested assearch aides for the online access to databases.Another possibility which we are considering isto place the K~PSI-type processing capabilities intoa microcomputer which is being used to mediate onlinesearches in remote databases.
All the text recordscontainin8 a given (not too frequent) word coulu beinitially tapped from the database into the micro-computer.
Following that the microcomputer couldperform all the above functions in an offline mode,REFERENCESArmltage, J.E., Lynch, M.F.
