The development ofa geo-parser comes from the need to explicitlygeoreference large resource collections such asthe Statistical Accounts of Scotland which cur-rently only contain implicit georeferences inthe form of placennames thus making such col-lections inherently geographically searchable.1 IntroductionThe project is being undertaken by the Edinburgh Univer-sity Data Library (Edina) as a part of the larger geoXwalk(www.geoXwalk.ac.uk) project which aims to developa protocol based (ADL, OGC and Z39.50) UK digitalgazetteer service.
The geo-parser uses the geoXwalkserver as the name authority for identified placename can-didates.2 The geo-coding processIn its current implementation, the service consists oftwo main components, the geo-parser and the geoXwalkgazetteer, with a generic demonstrator interface.
Theterm geo-parsing refers to the identification of place-names in a document/resource, where geo-coding refersto the tagging of the candidate and consequently the re-source with a geographic footprint.
Figure 1 shows thebasic geo-coding flowline.A resource is submitted to the geo-parser, which iden-tifies a series of potential placenames.
Each placenameis displayed along with the number of occurrences in thetext, and the number of matching gazetteer candidates.For each placename, a link to the gazetteer records isdisplayed and a highlight option is available for identi-fication in the original text which is displayed beneathFigure 1: The geo-coding processthe table.
Various sorting functions are also availablefor records of the table.
County and feature type arethe default attributes for disambiguation, although moreare available through the geoXwalk feature specification.Currently multiple gazetteer entries can be attached to asingle placename, enabling output of different instancesof the same name in the text.
Geo-coding output is avail-able in an application specific xml schema, csv, or html,and contains parser and editor matadata.
Outputted pla-cenames can be viewed on a map.
Clearly the degree ofhuman interaction is high duri!
ng the review stage, withthe process currently limited to individual resources.
Asgeo-parser development continues, user interaction at thisstage of the process will become less, although the po-tential for ?post process?
queries will rise, as the parseris more closely integrated with the geoXwalk database.As geo-parser development progresses the interface willneed to accommodate a more flexible approach to thegeo-coding process, as clearly interface requirements aredetermined by users with associated collections of spe-cific document types, and output requirements.
A rangeof functionality is required at various levels between afully automated batch processing mode and a more inter-active analytical approach to individual documents.
Fur-ther investigation is required on the integration of geo-coding output into existing document metadata.3 The geo-parserThe current architecture of the geo-parser is conceptuallybased on several passes across the text at varying levelsof abstraction.
Documents are split into blocks, blocksinto tokens.
Tokens are re-constituted into sentences, andthe sentences run through a place name finders to iden-tify candidate place names.
The current parser imple-mentation uses two techniques.
The first applies approxi-mately 300 different regular expressions at the token levelbased on patterns from training data (The Statistical Ac-counts of Scotland (http://edina.ac.uk/statacc).
Once allthe patterns have been run on the document then a secondpass is made to find likely placenames in conjunctions /disjunctions with other placenames.
Other patterns arealso used to attempt to remove false positives such as thenames of people, while others are based on the proximityof placename-like words (?shire?, ?river?
etc.).
The sec-ond approach uses the Brill tagger (Brill, 1994) to markeach token with a p!
art-of-speech tag, enabling rules tobe applied to the text surrounding proper nouns to selectlikely placenames.
Candidate placenames are then cross-referenced with the geoXwalk gazetteer, and a marked upversion of the original document and a summary XMLversion of results returned.
The need for large quantitiesexperimental data in order to develop identification anddisambiguation further is recognised.4 GeoXwalkGeoXwalk is more than just a simple lookup facilityfor the geo-parser as every geographic feature stored inthe gazetteer has its detailed geometry stored with it.This clearly enables more complex searching.
The abil-ity to derive the relationships between features implic-itly by geometric computation is significant and providesmore accurate results than can be ascertained by sim-ple lookups based on hierarchical thesauri methods asin traditional gazetteers.
When candidates are referencedagainst the gazetteer, geoXwalk provides a means to ac-cess its ?alternate?
geographies (of which there are manyin the UK) as well as a standard footprint.
For examplea candidate placename ?Knowsley?
could be resolved asparish code ?BX003?
as well as grid reference 340900,392300 - 347217, 397660.
The result is that more pow-erful geographical based search strategies can be appliede.g.
?find me all documents about Gaelic songs that donot reference the Western Isles?.5 ConclusionsIssues encountered during the ongoing development of adocument geo-coding tool are on the one hand concernedwith the identification and disambiguation of placenamesin the text, and on the other, the use of a sophisticatedmulti-purpose gazetteer service against which candidatesare referenced.
Interface flexibility is required to accom-modate the range of possible approaches to the applica-tion.Acknowledgments.
