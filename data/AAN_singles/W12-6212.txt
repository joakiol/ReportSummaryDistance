Due tothe distance between Spanish and Basque, theverbal-chain transfer is a very complex mod-ule in the overall system.
The grammar iscompiled with foma, an open-source finite-state toolkit, and yields a translation executiontime of 2000 verb chains/second.1 IntroductionThis paper presents the current status of develop-ment of an FST (Finite State Transducer) grammarwe have developed for Matxin, a Machine Transla-tion system between Spanish and Basque.Basque is a minority language isolate, and it islikely that an early form of this language was alreadypresent in Western Europe before the arrival of theIndo-European languages.Basque is a highly inflected language with freeorder of sentence constituents.
It is an agglutinativelanguage, with a rich flexional morphology.Basque is also a so-called ergative-absolutive lan-guage where the subjects of intransitive verbs ap-pear in the absolutive case (which is unmarked),and where the same case is used for the direct ob-ject of a transitive verb.
The subject of the transi-tive verb (that is, the agent) is marked differently,with the ergative case (in Basque by the suffix -k).The presence of this morpheme also triggers mainand auxiliary verbal agreement.
Auxiliary verbs, or?periphrastic?
verbs, which accompany most mainverbs, agree not only with the subject, but also withthe direct object and the indirect object, if present.Among European languages, this polypersonal sys-tem (multiple verb agreement) is rare, and foundonly in Basque, some Caucasian languages, andHungarian.The fact that Basque is both a morphologicallyrich and less-resourced language makes the use ofstatistical approaches for Machine Translation dif-ficult and raises the need to develop a rule-basedarchitecture which in the future could be combinedwith statistical techniques.The Matxin es-eu (Spanish-Basque) MT engineis a classic transfer-based system comprising threemain modules: analysis of the Spanish text (basedon FreeLing, (Atserias et al, 2006)), transfer, andgeneration of the Basque target text.In the transfer process, lexical transfer is firstcarried out using a bilingual dictionary coded inthe XML format of Apertium dictionary files (.dix)(Forcada et al, 2009), and compiled, using the FSTlibrary implemented in the Apertium project (the lt-toolbox library), into a finite-state transducer thatcan be processed very quickly.Following this, structural transfer at the sentencelevel is performed, and some information is trans-ferred from some chunks1 to others while somechunks may be deleted.
Finally, the structural trans-1A chunk is a non-recursive phrase (noun phrase, preposi-tional phrase, verbal chain, etc.)
which expresses a constituent(Abney, 1991; Civit, 2003).
In our system, chunks play a cru-cial part in simplifying the translation process, due to the factthat each module works only at a single level, either inside orbetween chunks.65fer at the verb chunk level is carried out.
The verbalchunk transfer is a very complex module because ofthe nature of Spanish and Basque auxiliary verb con-structions, and is the main subject of this paper.This verb chain transfer module is implementedas a series of ordered replacement rules (Beesley andKarttunen, 2003) using the foma finite-state toolkit(Hulden, 2009).
In total, the system consists of 166separate replacement rules that together perform theverb chunk translation.
In practice, the input is givento the first transducer, after which its output is passedto the second, and so forth, in a cascade.
Each rule inthe system is unambiguous in its output; that is, foreach input in a particular step along the verb chaintransfer, the transducers never produce multiple out-puts (i.e.
the transducers in question are functional).Some of the rules are joined together with composi-tion, yielding a total of 55 separate transducers.
Inprinciple, all the rules could be composed togetherinto one monolithic transducer, but in practice thesize of the composed transducer is too large to befeasible.
The choice to combine some transduc-ers while leaving others separate is largely a mem-ory/translation speed tradeoff.2 Spanish and Basque verb features andtheir translationIn the following, we will illustrate some of the mainissues in translating Spanish verb chains to Basque.Since both languages make frequent use of auxiliaryverb constructions, and since periphrastic verb con-structions are frequent in Basque, transfer rules canget quite complex in their design.For example, in translating the phrase(Yo) compro (una manzana)(I) buy (an apple)[PP1CSN00] [VMIP1S0] [DI0FS0] [NCFS000]we can translate it using the imperfective partici-ple form (erosten) of the verb erosi (to buy), and atransitive auxiliary (dut) which itself contains bothsubject agreement information (I: 1st sg.)
and num-ber agreement with the object (an apple: 3rd sg.
):(nik) (sagar bat) erosten dut.
The participle carriesinformation concerning meaning, aspect and tense,whereas the auxiliaries convey information about ar-gument structure, tense and mood.Table 1 illustrates the central idea of the verbchunk transfer.
In the first four examples the form ofthe transitive auxiliary changes to express agreementwith different ergative arguments (the subject of theclause), absolutive arguments (the direct object) anddative arguments (the indirect object).
In the fifthexample the future participle is used.
The last ex-ample shows the translation of a periphrastic con-struction, in which the the Spanish and the Basqueword orders are completely different: this is re-flected in the Spanish tengo que-construction (haveto) which appears before the main verb, whereas inthe Basque, the equivalent (behar) appears after themain verb (erosi).3 The FST grammarWe carry out the verbal chunk transfer using finite-state transducers (Alegria et al, 2005).
The gram-mar rules take as input the Spanish verbal chunk,perform a number of transformations on the input,and then create and output the verbal chunk forBasque.To illustrate the functioning of the grammar, let usconsider the following example sentence in Spanish:?Un tribunal ha negado los derechos constitu-cionales a los presos polticos?
(A court has deniedconstitutional rights to political prisoners).
The cor-rect translation into Basque given by the system forthis example is as follows: Auzitegi batek eskubidekonstituzionalak ukatu dizkie preso politikoei.
Fig-ure 1 shows a detailed overview of how the wholetransfer of the verbal chunk is performed for this par-ticular example.First, the input to the grammar is assumed to be astring containing (separated by the ?&?
symbol) thefollowing information :?
the morphological information (usingEAGLES-style tags Leech and Wilson(1996)) for all nodes (separated by ?+?symbol) in the Spanish verbal chunk(haber[VAIP3S0]+negar[VMP00SM]);?

Identification of the Basque verbal chunkschema corresponding to the source verbalchunk.There are twelve rules which perform this task,each of which corresponds to one of the follow-ing verbal chunks in Spanish: non-conjugatedverbs, simple non-periphrastic verbs as wellas four different groups reserved for the pe-riphrastic verbs.The verbal chunk of the example in figure 1 isa simple non-periphrastic one, and the rule thathandles this particular case is as follows:[simpleVerbEsType -> ...simpleVerbEuSchema]When this rule matches the input stringrepresenting a simple non-periphrastic ver-bal chunk (simpleVerbEsType) it adds thecorresponding Basque verbal chunk schema(simpleVerbEuSchema) to the end of the inputstring.
simpleVerbEsType is a complex au-tomaton that has the definition of the Spanishsimple verbs.
simpleVerbEuSchema is the typeof the verbal chunk (SimpleVerb) and an au-tomaton that contains as strings the pattern ofelements (separated by the ?/?

Elimination of source-language information (4rules in total).The output of the grammar for the example is:ukatu(main)[perfPart] /edun(aux)[indPres][abs3p][dat3p][erg3s]The first node has the main verb (ukatu) withthe perfective participle aspect, and the sec-ond one contains the auxiliary verb (edun) withall its morphological information: indicativepresent and argument structure.In the output string, each of the elements containsthe information needed by the subsequent syntacticgeneration and morphological generation phases.4 ImplementationWhen the verbal chunk transfer module was first de-veloped, there did not exist any efficient open-sourcetools for the construction of finite state transduc-ers.
At the time, the XFST-toolkit (Beesley andKarttunen, 2003) was used to produce the earlierversions of the module: this included 25 separatetransducers of moderate size, occupying 2,795 kBin total.
The execution speed was roughly 250 verbchains per second.
Since Matxin was designed to beopen source, we built a simple compiler that con-verted the XFST rules into regular expressions thatcould then be applied without FST technology, at thecost of execution speed.
This verbal chunk transfermodule read and applied these regular expressionsat a speed of 50 verbal chunks per second.In the work presented here, we have reimple-mented and expanded the original rules written forXFST with the foma2 toolkit (Hulden, 2009).
Af-ter adapting the grammar and compiling it, the 55separate transducers occupy 607 kB and operate atroughly 2,000 complete verb chains per second.3Passing the strings from one transducer to the next inthe chain of 55 transducers in accomplished by thedepth-first-search transducer chaining functionalityavailable in the foma API.2http://foma.sourceforge.net3On a 2.8MHz Intel Core 2 Duo.68ReferencesAbney, S.
