Sanae Fujita, NTT Communications Science Laboratory<sanae@kecl.cslab.ntt.co.jp>AbstractThe Japanese WordNet currently has51,000 synsets with Japanese entries.
Inthis paper, we discuss three methods ofextending it: increasing the cover, linkingit to examples in corpora and linking itto other resources (SUMO and GoiTaikei).In addition, we outline our plans to makeit more useful by adding Japanese defini-tion sentences to each synset.
Finally, wediscuss how releasing the corpus under anopen license has led to the constructionof interfaces in a variety of programminglanguages.1 IntroductionOur goal is to make a semantic lexicon ofJapanese that is both accesible and usable.
Tothis end we are constructing and releasing theJapanese WordNet (WN-Ja) (Bond et al, 2008a).We have almost completed the first stage,where we automatically translated the Englishand Euro WordNets, and are hand correcting it.We introduce this in Section 2.
Currently, weare extending it in three main areas: the firstis to add more concepts to the Japanese Word-Net, either by adding Japanese to existing En-glish synsets or by creating new synsets (?
3).The second is to link the synsets to text exam-ples (?
4).
Finally, we are linking it to other re-sources: the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology(SUMO) (Niles and Pease, 2001), the Japanesesemantic lexicon GoiTaikei (Ikehara et al, 1997),and a collection of illustrations taken from theOpen ClipArt Library (Phillips, 2005) (?
5).2 Current StateCurrently, the WN-Ja consists of 157,000 senses(word-synset pairs) 51,000 concepts (synsets) and81,000 unique Japanese words (version 0.91).
Therelational structure (hypernym, meronym, do-main, .
.
. )
is based entirely on the English Word-Net 3.0 (Fellbaum, 1998).
We have Japanesewords for 43.0% of the synsets in the EnglishWordNet.
Of these synsets, 45% have beenchecked by hand, 8% were automatically cre-ated by linking through multiple languages and46% were automatically created by adding non-ambiguous translations, as described in Bondet al (2008a).
There are some 51,000 synsets withJapanese candidate words that have not yet beenchecked.
For up-to-date information on WN-Jasee: nlpwww.nict.go.jp/wn-ja.An example of the entry for the synset02076196-n is shown in Figure 1.
Most fieldscome from the English WordNet.
We have addedthe underlined fields (Ja Synonyms, Illustration,links to GoiTaikei, SUMO) and are currentlyadding the translated definition (Def (Ja)).
Inthe initial automatic construction there were 27Japanese words associated with the synset,1 in-cluding many inappropriate translations for othersenses of seal (e.g., ??
hanko ?stamp?).
Thesewere reduced to three after checking: ????,??
azarashi ?seal?
and ??
?
shi-ru ?seal?.Synsets with?
in their names are those for whichthere is currently no Japanese entry in the Word-Net.The main focus of this year?s work has beenthis manual trimming of badly translated words.The result is a WordNet with a reasonable cov-erage of common Japanese words.
The precisionper sense is just over 90%.
We have aimed at highcoverage at the cost of precision for two reasons:(i) we think that the WordNet must have a rea-1???

?1sonable coverage to be useful for NLP tasks and(ii) we expect to continue refining the accuracyover the following years.
Our strategy is thus dif-ferent from Euro WordNet (Vossen, 1998), whereinitial emphasis was on building a consistent andcomplete upper ontology.3 Increasing CoverageWe are increasing the coverage in two ways.
Thefirst is to continue to manually correct the auto-matically translated synsets.
This is being doneboth by hand, as time permits, and also by com-paring against other resources such as GoiTaikeiand Wikipedia.
When we check for poor candi-dates, we also add in missing words as they occurto us.More interestingly, we wish to add synsets forJapanese concepts that may not be expressed inthe English WordNet.
To decide which new con-cepts to add, we will be guided by the other taskswe are doing: annotation and linking.
We intendto create new synsets for words found in the cor-pora we annotate that are not currently covered,as well as for concepts that we want to link to.An example for the first is the concept ??
go-han ?cooked rice?, as opposed to the grain ?kome ?rice?.
An example of the second is????
?shinguru ?single: a song usually extractedfrom a current or upcoming album to promotethe album?.
This is a very common hypernym inWikipedia but missing from the English Word-Net.As far as possible, we want to coordinate thecreation of new synsets with other projects: forexample KorLex: the Korean WordNet aleadymakes the cooked rice/grain distinction, and theEnglish WordNet should also have a synset forthis sense of single.4 Text AnnotationWe are in the process of annotating four texts(Table 1).
The first two are translations of Word-Net annotated English Texts (SemCor and theWordNet definitions), the third is the Japanesenewspaper text that forms the Kyoto Corpusand the fourth is an open corpus of bilingualJapanese-English sentences (Tanaka).
In 2009,we expect to finish translating and annotate allof SemCor, translate the WordNet definitions andName Sentences Words Content WordsSemCor 12,842 224,260 120,000Definitions 165,977 1,468,347 459,000Kyoto 38,383 969,558 527,000Tanaka 147,190 1,151,892 360,000Table 1: Corpora to be Sense Taggedstart annotation on the Kyoto and Tanaka Cor-pora.This annotation is essential for finding missingsenses in the Japanese WordNet, as well as get-ting the sense distributions that are needed forsupervised word sense disambiguation.4.1 SemCorSemCor is a textual corpus in which words havebeen both syntactically and semantically tagged.The texts included in SemCor were extractedfrom the Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera,1979) and then linked to senses in the EnglishWordNet.
The frequencies in this corpus wereused to give the sense frequencies in WordNet(Fellbaum, 1998).
A subset of this corpus (Mul-tiSemCor) was translated into Italian and usedas a corpus for the Italian WordNet (Bentivogliet al, 2004).
We are translating this subset intoJapanese.In the same way as Bentivogli et al (2004), weare exploiting Cross-Language Annotation Trans-fer to seed the Japanese annotation.
For exam-ple, consider (1)2.
The content words answer,was, simple, honest are tagged in SemCor.
Theycan be aligned with their translations ??
ko-tae ?answer?, ??
kantan ?simple?, ??
soc-choku ?honest?
and ???
datta ?was?.
Thisallows us to tag the Japanese translation withthe same synsets as the English, and thus disam-biguate them.

For example, the En-glish phrase last night can be translated into ??

?word which has no suitable synset in the EnglishWordNet.
In this case, we need to create a newsynset unique to the Japanese WordNet.3We chose a translated SemCor as the basis ofannotation for two main reasons: (i) the cor-pus can be freely redistributed ?
we expectthe glosses to be useful as an aligned corpus ofJapanese-English-Italian and (ii) it has other an-notations associated with it: Brown corpus POSannotation, Penn Treebank syntactic annotation.4.2 WordNet DefinitionsOur second translated corpus is formed fromthe WordNet definitions (and example sentences)themselves (e.g., the def field shown in Figure 1).The English definitions have been annotated withword senses in the Princeton WordNet Gloss Cor-pus.
In the same way that we do for SemCor, weare translating the definitions and examples, andusing the existing annotation to seed our annota-tion.Using the definitions as the base for a senseannotated corpus is attractive for the followingreasons: (i) the translated corpus can be freelyredistributed ?
we expect the definitions to beuseful as an aligned corpus and also to be usefulfor many other open lexicons; (ii) the definitionsare useful for Japanese native speakers using theWordNet, (iii) the definitions are useful for unsu-pervised sense disambiguation techniques such asLESK (Baldwin et al, 2008); (iv) other projects3Arguably, the fact that one says last night (not yester-day night) for the night proceeding today and tomorrownight (not next night) for the night following today sug-gests that these multi-word expressions are lexicalized andsynsets should be created for them in the English Word-Net.
However, in general we expect to create some synsetsthat will be unique to the Japanese WordNet.have also translated synset definitions (e.g.
Span-ish and Korean), so we can hope to create a multi-lingual corpus here as well and (v) the definitionscan be used as a machine readable dictionary, andvarious information extracted from there (Barn-brook, 2002; Nichols et al, 2006)4.3 Kyoto Text CorpusThe Kyoto Text Corpus consists of newspapertext from the Mainichi Newspaper (1995), seg-mented and annotated with Japanese POS tagsand dependency trees (Kurohashi and Nagao,2003).
The corpus is made up of two parts.
Thefirst consists of 17 full days of articles and the sec-ond of one year?s editorials.
We hope to annotateat least parts of it during 2009.Even though the Kyoto Text Corpus is notfreely redistributable, we have chosen to anno-tate it due to the wealth of annotation associatedwith it: dependency trees, predicate-argument re-lations and co-reference (Iida et al, 2007), trans-lations into English and Chinese (Uchimoto et al,2004) and sense annotations from the Hinokiproject (Bond et al, 2006).
We also felt it wasimportant to tag some native Japanese text, notonly translated text.4.4 Tanaka CorpusFinally, we will also tag the Tanaka Corpus, anopen corpus of Japanese-English sentence pairscompiled by Professor Yasuhito Tanaka at HyogoUniversity and his students (Tanaka, 2001) andreleased into the public domain.
The correctedversion we use has around 140,000 sentence pairs.This corpus is attractive for several reasons.
(i) it is freely redistributable; (ii) it has been in-dexed to entries in the Japanese-English dictio-3nary JMDict (Breen, 2003); (iii) part of it hasalso been used in an open HPSG-based treebank(Bond et al, 2008b); (iv) further, translations inother languages, most notably French, have beenadded by the TATOEBA project.4 Our plan isto tag this automatically using the tools devel-oped for the Kyoto corpus annotation, and thento open the data to the community for refinement.We give a typical example sentence in (2).

(fr)5 Linking to other resourcesWe currently link the Japanese WordNet to threeother resources: the Suggested Upper MergedOntology; GoiTaikei, a Japanese Lexicon; and acollection of pictures from the Open Clip Art Li-brary (OCAL: Phillips (2005)).For SUMO we used existing mappings.
For theother resources, we find confident matches auto-matically and then generalize from them.
We findmatches in three ways:MM Monosemous monolingual matchese.g.
cricket bat or ??
azarashi ?seal?MB Monosemous bilingual matchese.g.
???
?seal?HH Hypernym/Hyponym pairse.g.
?seal ?
mammal?We intend to use the same techniques to linkother resources, such as the concepts from theEDR lexicon (EDR, 1990) and the automati-cally extracted hypernym-hyponym links fromTorishiki-kai (Kuroda et al, 2009).5.1 SUMOThe Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO)is a large formal public ontology freely releasedby the IEEE (Niles and Pease, 2001).Because the structure of the Japanese Word-Net is closely linked to that of the English Word-Net, we were able to take advantage of the ex-isting mappings from the English WordNet toSUMO.
There are 102,669 mappings from SUMO4wwwcyg.utc.fr/tatoeba/Carnivore Business CompetitionFigure 2: SUMO illustrationsto WordNet: 3,593 equivalent, 10,712 where theWordNet synset subsumes the SUMO concept,88,065 where the SUMO concept subsumes theWordNet concept, 293 where the negation of theSUMO concept subsumes the WordNet synsetand 6 where the negation of the SUMO conceptis equivalent to the WordNet synset.
Accordingto the mapping, synset 02076196-n ??
azarashi?seal?, shown in Figure 1 is subsumed by theSUMO concept ??Carnivore??.
There is no linkbetween seal and carnivore in WordNet, whichshows how different ontologies can complementeach other.Linking to SUMO also allowed us to use theSUMO illustrations.5 These consist of 12,237links linking 4,607 concepts to the urls of 10,993illustrations.
These are mainly taken fromfrom Wikimedia (upload.wikimedia.org), witharound 1,000 from other sources.
The picturescan be linked quite loosely to the concepts.
Forexample, ??Carnivore??
is illustrated by a lion eat-ing meat, and ??BusinessCompetition??
by a pic-ture of Wall Street.As we wanted our illustrations to be more con-crete, we only use SUMO illustrations where theSUMO-WordNet mapping is equivalence.
Thisgave 4,384 illustrations for 999 synsets.5.2 GoiTaikeiLinking Goi-Taikei, we used not only theJapanese dictionary published in Ikehara et al(1997), but also the Japanese-English dictionaryused in the machine translation system ALT-J/E(Ikehara et al, 1991).
We attempted to matchsynsets to semantic categories by matching the5Available at http://sigmakee.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sigmakee/KBs/pictureList.kif, thanks toAdam Pease for letting us know about them.4Japanese, English and English-Japanese pairs tounambiguous entries in Goi-Taikei.
For example,the synset shown in Figure 1 was automaticallyassigned the semantic category ??537:beast?
?, as??
appears only once in WN-Ja, with the synsetshown, and once in the Japanese dictionary forALT-J/E with a single semantic category.We are currently evaluating our results againstan earlier attempt to link WordNet and GoiTaikeithat also matched synset entries to words in Goi-Taikei (Asanoma, 2001), but did not add an extraconstraint (that they must be either monosemousor match as a hypernym-hyponym pair).Once we have completed the mapping, we willuse it to check for inconsistencies in the two re-sources.5.3 Open ClipArt LibraryIn order to make the sense distinctions more vis-ible we have semi-automatically linked synsetsto illustrations from the Open Clip Art Library(OCAL: Phillips (2005)) using the mappings pro-duced by Bond et al (2008a).We manually checked the mappings and addeda goodness score.
Illustrations are marked as:3 the best out of multiple illustrations2 a good illustration for the synset1 a suitable illustration, but not perfectThis tag was used for black and white im-ages, outlines, and so forth.After the scoring, there were 874 links for 541synsets (170 scored 1, 642 scored 2 and 62 scored3).
This is only a small subset of illustrations inOCAL and an even smaller proportion of word-net.
However, because any illustrated synset alo(in theory) illustrates its hypernyms, we have in-directly illustrated far more than 541 synsets:these figures are better than they seem.There are far fewer OCAL illustrations thanthe SUMO linked illustrations.
However, they arein general more representative illustrations (espe-cially those scored 2 and above), and the source ofthe clipart is available as SVG source so it is easyto manipulate them.
We think that this makesthem particularly useful for a variety of tasks.One is pedagogical ?
it is useful to have pic-tures in learners?
dictionaries.
Another is in cross-cultural communication - for example in Pangea,where children use pictons (small concept repre-senting pictures) to write messages (Takasaki andMori, 2007).The OCAL illustrations mapped throughWordNet to 541 SUMO concepts.
We have giventhese links to the SUMO researchers.6 InterfacesWe released the Japanese WordNet in three for-mats: tab-delimited text, XML and as an SQLitedatabase.
The license was the same as EnglishWordNet.
This is a permissive license, the datacan be reused within proprietary software on thecondition that the license is distributed with thatsoftware (similar to the MIT X license).
Thelicense is also GPL-compatible, meaning thatthe GPL permits combination and redistributionwith software that uses it.The tab delimited format consists of just a listof synsets, Japanese words and the type of link(hand, multi-lingual or monosemous):02076196-n ??
hand02076196-n ????
hand02076196-n ???
handWe also output in WordNet-LMF (Francopouloet al, 2006; Soria et al, 2009), to make theprogram easily available for other WordNet re-searchers.
In this case the synset structure wastaken from the English WordNet and the lem-mas from the Japanese WordNet.
Because of theincomplete coverage, not all synsets contain lem-mas.
This format is used by the Kyoto Project,and we expect it to become the standard ex-change format for WordNets (Vossen et al, 2008).Finally, we also created an SQL database.
Thiscontains information from the English WordNet,the Japanese WordNet, and links to illustra-tions.
We chose SQLite,6 a self-contained, zero-configuration, SQL database engine whose sourcecode is in the public domain.
The core structureis very simple with six tables, as shown in Fig-ure 3.As we prepared the release we wrote a perlmodule for a basic interface.
This was used todevelop a web interface: Figure 4 shows a screen-shot.6http://www.sqlite.org5wordwordidlanglemmapronpossensesynsetwordidlangranklexidfreqsrc1..*1synsetposnamesrc11..*synsetDefsynsetlangdefsid11synlinksynset1synset2linksrc1 1..*xlinksynsetresourcexrefmiscconfidence1 1..*Figure 3: Database SchemaFigure 4: Web Search Screenshot67 DiscussionIn contrast to earlier WordNets, the JapaneseWordNet was released with two known major im-perfections: (i) the concept hierarchy was en-tirely based on English with no adaptation toJapanese and (ii) the data was released with someunchecked automatically created entries.
The re-sult was a WordNet that did not fully model thelexical structure of Japanese and was known tocontain an estimated 5% errors.
The motivationbehind this was twofold.
Firstly, we wanted to tryand take advantage of the open source model.
Ifthe first release was good enough to be useful, wehoped to (a) let people use it and (b) get feedbackfrom them which could then be incorporated intothe next release.
This is the strategy known asrelease early, release often (Raymond, 1999).Secondly, we anticipated the most common useof the WordNet to be in checking whether oneword is a hypernym of another.
In this case, evenif one word is wrong, it is unlikely that the otherwill be, so a small percentage of errors should beacceptable.From the practical point of view, the early re-lease appears to have been a success.
The SQLdatabase proved very popular, and within twoweeks of the first release someone produced apython API.
This was soon followed by inter-faces in java, ruby, objective C and gauche.
Wealso received feedback on effective indexing of thedatabase and some corrections of entries ?
thesehave been included in the most recent release(0.91).The data from the Japanese WordNet has al-ready been incorporated into other projects.
Thefirst was the Multi-Lingual Semantic Network(MLSN) (Cook, 2008) a WordNet based net-work of Arabic, Chinese, English, German andJapanese.
Because both the Japanese WordNetand MLSN use very open licenses, it is possibleto share entries directly.
We have already re-ceived useful feedback and over a thousand newentries from MLSN.
The second project using ourdata is the Asian WordNet (Charoenporn et al,2008).
They have a well developed interface forcollaborative development of linguistic resources,and we hope to get corrections and additionsfrom them in the future.
Another project us-ing the Japanese WordNet data is the LanguageGrid (Ishida, 2006) which offers the English andJapanese WordNets as concept dictionaries.We have also been linked to from other re-sources.
The Japanese-English lexicon projectJMDict (Breen, 2004) now links to the JapaneseWordNet, and members of that project are us-ing WordNet to suggest new entries.
We usedJMDict in the first automatic construction stage,so it is particularly gratifying to be able to helpJMDict in turn.Finally, we believe that data about languageshould be shared ?
language is part of the com-mon heritage of its speakers.
In our case, theJapanese WordNet was constructed based on thework that others made available to us and thus wehad a moral obligation to make our results freelyavailable to others.
Further, projects that createWordNets but do not release them freely hinderresearch on lexical semantics in that language ?people cannot use the unreleased resource, but itis hard to get funding to duplicate something thatalready exists.In future work, in addition to the planned ex-tensions listed here, we would like to work onthe following: Explicitly marking lexical variants;linking to instances in Wikipedia; adding deriva-tional and antonym links; using the WordNet forword sense disambiguation.8 ConclusionThis paper presents the current state of theJapanese WordNet (157,000 senses, 51,000 con-cepts and 81,000 unique Japanese words, withlinks to SUMO, Goi-Taikei and OCAL) and out-lined our plans for further work (more words,links to corpora and other resources).
We hopethat WN-Ja will become a useful resource not onlyfor natural language processing, but also for lan-guage education/learning and linguistic research.ReferencesNaoki Asanoma.
