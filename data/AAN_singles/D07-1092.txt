In particu-lar, they drastically impact machine transla-tion quality.
An easy way out commercialtranslation systems usually offer their usersis the possibility to add unknown wordsand their translations into a dedicated lex-icon.
Recently, Stroppa and Yvon (2005)have shown how analogical learning alonedeals nicely with morphology in differentlanguages.
In this study we show that ana-logical learning offers as well an elegant andeffective solution to the problem of identify-ing potential translations of unknown words.1 IntroductionAnalogical reasoning has received some attention incognitive science and artificial intelligence (Gentneret al, 2001).
It has been for a long time a faculty as-sessed in the so-called SAT Reasoning tests used inthe application process to colleges and universitiesin the United States.
Turney (2006) has shown thatit is possible to compute relational similarities in acorpus in order to solve 56% of typical analogicaltests quizzed in SAT exams.
The interested readercan find in (Lepage, 2003) a particularly dense treat-ment of analogy, including a fascinating chapter onthe history of the notion of analogy.The concept of proportional analogy, denoted[A : B = C : D ], is a relation between fourentities which reads: ?A is to B as C is to D?.Among proportional analogies, we distinguish for-mal analogies, that is, ones that arise at the graph-ical level, such as [fournit : fleurit = fournie :fleurie] in French or [believer : unbelievable =doer : undoable] in English.
Formal analogies areoften good indices for deeper analogies (Stroppa andYvon, 2005).Lepage and Denoual (2005) presented the sys-tem ALEPH, an intriguing example-based systementirely built on top of an automatic formal anal-ogy solver.
This system has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the IWSLT task (Eck and Hori,2005), despite its striking purity.
As a matter offact, ALEPH requires no distances between exam-ples, nor any threshold.1 It does not even rely ona tokenization device.
One reason for its successprobably lies in the specificity of the BTEC corpus:short and simple sentences of a narrow domain.
It isdoubtful that ALEPH would still behave adequatelyon broader tasks, such as translating news articles.Stroppa and Yvon (2005) propose a very help-ful algebraic description of a formal analogy anddescribe the theoretical foundations of analogicallearning which we will recap shortly.
They showboth its elegance and efficiency on two morphologi-cal analysis tasks for three different languages.Recently, Moreau et al (2007) showed that for-mal analogies of a simple kind (those involving suf-fixation and/or prefixation) offer an effective way toextend queries for improved information retrieval.In this study, we show that analogical learningcan be used as an effictive method for translatingunknown words or phrases.
We found that our ap-proach has the potential to propose a valid transla-tion for 80% of ordinary unknown words, that is,words that are not proper names, compound words,or numerical expressions.
Specific solutions havebeen proposed for those token types (Chen et al,1998; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Koehn andKnight, 2003).The paper is organized as follows.
We first recall1Some heuristics are applied for speeding up the system.877in Section 2 the principle of analogical learning anddescribe how it can be applied to the task of enrich-ing a bilingual lexicon.
In Section 3, we present thecorpora we used in our experiments.
We evaluateour approach over two translation tasks in Section 4.We discuss related work in Section 5 and give per-spectives of our work in Section 6.2 Analogical Learning2.1 PrincipleOur approach to bilingual lexical enrichment is aninstance of analogical learning described in (Stroppaand Yvon, 2005).

, LN}gathers N observations.
A set of features computedon an incomplete observation X defines an inputspace.
The inference task consists in predicting themissing features which belong to an output space.We denote I(X) (resp.
O(X)) the projection of Xinto the input (resp.
output) space.
The inferenceprocedure involves three steps:1.
Building EI(X) = {(A,B,C) ?
L3 | [I(A) :I(B) = I(C) : I(X)]}, the set of input stems2of X , that is the set of triplets (A,B,C) whichform with X an analogical equation.2.
Building EO(X) = {Y | [O(A) : O(B) =O(C) : Y ] ,?
(A,B,C) ?
EI(X)} the set ofsolutions to the analogical equations obtainedby projecting the stems of EI(X) into the out-put space.3.
Selecting O(X) among the elements ofEO(X).This inference procedure shares similarities withthe K-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) approach.
In partic-ular, since no model of the training material is be-ing learned, the training corpus needs to be storedin order to be queried.
On the contrary to k-NN,however, the search for closest neighbors does notrequire any distance, but instead relies on relationalsimilarities.
This purity has a cost: while in k-NNinference, neighbors can be found in time linear tothe training size, in analogical learning, this oper-ation requires a computation time cubic in N , the2In Turney?s work (Turney, 2006), a stem designates the firsttwo words of a proportional analogy.number of observations.
In many applications of in-terest, including the one we tackle here, this is sim-ply impractical and heuristics must be applied.The first and second steps of the inference proce-dure rely on the existence of an analogical solver,which we sketch in the next section.
One impor-tant thing to note at this stage, is that an analogicalequation may have several solutions, some being le-gitimate word-forms in a given language, others be-ing not.
Thus, it is important to select wisely thegenerated solutions, therefore Step 3.
In practice,the inference procedure involves the computation ofmany analogical equations, and a statistic as simpleas the frequency of a solution often suffices to sepa-rate good from spurious solutions.2.2 Analogical SolverLepage (1998) proposed an algorithm for comput-ing the solutions of a formal analogical equation[A : B = C : ?
].
We implemented a variant ofthis algorithm which requires to compute two edit-distance tables, one between A and B and one be-tween A and C. Since we are looking for subse-quences of B and C not present in A, insertion costis null.
Once this is done, the algorithm synchro-nizes the alignments defined by the paths of min-imum cost in each table.
Intuitively, the synchro-nization of two alignments (one between A and B,and one between A and C) consists in composing inthe correct order subsequences of the strings B andC that are not in A.
We refer the reader to (Lep-age, 1998) for the intricacies of this process whichis illustrated in Figure 1 for the analogical equation[even : usual = unevenly : ?
].
In this exam-ple, there are 681 different paths that align even andusual (with a cost of 4), and 1 path which aligns evenwith unevenly (with a cost of 0).
This results in 681synchronizations which generate 15 different solu-tions, among which only unusually is a legitimateword-form.In practice, since the number of minimum-costpaths may be exponential in the size of the stringsbeing aligned, we consider the synchronization ofa maximum of M best paths in each edit-distancetable.
The worst-case complexity of our analogicalsolver is O([|A| ?
(|B| + |C|)] + [M2 ?
(|A| +ins(B,C))]), where the first term corresponds tothe computation of the two edit-distance tables,8784 4 4 4 4 4 n 4 4 3 3 2 1 0 0 03 3 3 3 3 3 e 3 3 3 2 1 0 0 0 02 2 2 2 2 2 v 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 01 1 1 1 1 1 e 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0l a u s u / .

The bottompart of the figure shows 2 of the 681 synchroniza-tions computed while solving the equation [even :usual = unevenly : ?
].
The first one corresponds tothe path marked in bold italics and leads to a spuri-ous solution; the second leads to a legitimate solu-tion and corresponds to the path shown as squares.and the second one corresponds to the maximumtime needed to synchronize them.
|X| denotes thelength, counted in characters of the string X , whilstins(B,C) stands for the number of characters of Band C not belonging to A.
Given the typical lengthof the strings we consider in this study, our solver isquite efficient.3Stroppa and Yvon (2005) described a generaliza-tion of this algorithm which can solve a formal ana-logical equation by composing two finite-state trans-ducers.2.3 Application to Lexical EnrichmentAnalogical inference can be applied to the task ofextending an existing bilingual lexicon (or transfertable) with new entries.
In this study, we focus ona particular enrichment task: the one of translatingvalid words or phrases that were not encountered attraining time.A simple example of how our approach translatesunknown words is illustrated in Figure 2 for the (un-3Several thousands of equations solved within one second.Step 1 source (French) stems[activite?s : activite?

In this example, trans-lations is inferred by commuting plural and singularwords.
The inference process lazily captures the factthat English plural nouns ending in -ies usually cor-respond to singular nouns ending in -y.Formally, we are given a training corpus L ={?S1, T1?, .
.
.
, ?SN , TN ?}
which consists of a col-lection of N bilingual lexicon entries ?Si, Ti?.
Theinput space is in our case the space of possiblesource words, while the output space is the set ofpossible target words.
We define:?X ?
?S ,T?, I(X) = S and O(X) = TGiven an unknown source word-form S, Step 1 ofthe inference process consists in identifying sourcestems which have S as a solution:4EI(S) = {?i, j, k?
?
[1, N ]3 | [Si : Sj = Sk : S]}.During Step 2a, each source stem belonging toEI(S) is projected form by form into (potentiallyseveral) stems in the output space, thanks to an op-erator proj that will be defined shortly:E?i ,j ,k ?
(S) = {T | [U : V = W : T ]} where(U, V,W ) ?
(projL(Si)?
projL(Sj)?
projL(Sk)).4All strings in a stem must be different, otherwise, it can beshown that all source words would be considered.879During Step 2b, each solution to those outputstems is collected in EO(S) along with its associatedfrequency:EO(S) =?
?i ,j ,k ?
?EI(S)E?i ,j ,k ?
(S).Step 3 selects from EO(S) one or several solu-tions.
We use frequency as criteria to sort the gener-ated solutions.
The projection mechanism we resortto in this study simply is a lexicon look-up:projL(S) = {T | ?S, T ?
?
L}.There are several situations where this inferenceprocedure will introduce noise.
First, both sourceand target analogical equations can lead to spuri-ous solutions.
For instance, [show : showing =eating : ? ]
will erroneously produce eatinging.
Sec-ond, an error in the original lexicon may introduceas well erroneous target word-forms.
For instance,when translating the German word proklamierung,by making use of the analogy [formalisiert :formalisierung = proklamiert : proklamierung],the English equation [formalised : formalized =sets : ? ]
will be considered if it happens thatproklamiert?sets belongs to L; in which case, zetswill be erroneously produced.We control noise in several ways.
The sourceword-forms we generate are filtered by imposingthat they belong to the input space.
We also use a(large) target vocabulary to eliminate spurious tar-get word-forms (see Section 3).
More importantly,since we consider many analogical equations whentranslating a word-form, spurious analogical solu-tions tend to appear less frequently than ones arisingfrom paradigmatic commutations.2.4 Practical ConsiderationsSearching for EI(S) is an operation which requiressolving a number of (source) analogical equationscubic in the size of the input space.
In many settingsof interest, including ours, this is simply not practi-cal.
We therefore resort to two strategies to reducecomputation time.
The first one consists in using theanalogical equations in a generative mode.
Insteadof searching through the set of stems ?Si, Sj , Sk?that have for solution the unknown source word-form S, we search for all pairs (Si, Sj) to the so-lutions of [Si : Sj = S :?]
that are valid word-formsof the input space.
Note that this is an exact methodwhich follows from the property (Lepage, 1998):[A : B = C : D ] ?
[B : A = D : C ]This leaves us with a quadratic computation timewhich is still intractable in our case.
Therefore,we apply a second strategy which consists in com-puting the analogical equations [Si : Sj = S :?
]for the only words Si and Sj close enough to S.More precisely, we enforce that Si ?
v?
(S) and thatSj ?
v?
(Si) for a neighborhood function v?
(A) ofthe form:v?
(A) = {B | f(B,A) ?
?
}where f is a distance; we used the edit-distance inthis study (Levenshtein, 1966).
Note that the secondstrategy we apply is only a heuristic.3 ResourcesIn this work, we are concerned with one concreteproblem a machine translation system must face:the one of translating unknown words.
We are fur-ther focusing on the shared task of the workshopon Statistical Machine Translation, which took placelast year (Koehn and Monz, 2006) and consisted intranslating Spanish, German, and French texts fromand to English.
For some reasons, we restricted our-selves to translating only into English.
The trainingmaterial available is coming from the Europarl cor-pus.
The test material was divided into two parts.5The first one (hereafter called test-in) is com-posed of 2 000 sentences from European parliamentdebates.
The second part (called test-out) gath-ers 1 064 sentences6 collected from editorials of theProject Syndicate website.7 The main statistics per-tinent to our study are summarized in Table 1.A rough analysis of the 441 different unknownwords encountered in the French test sets revealsthat 54 (12%) of them contain at least one digit(years, page numbers, law numbers, etc.
), 83 (20%)are proper names, 37 (8%) are compound words,18 (4%) are foreign words (often Latin or Greek5The participants were not aware of this.6We removed 30 sentences which had encoding problems.7http://www.project-syndicate.com880French Spanish Germantest- in out in out in out|unknown| 180 265 233 292 469 599oov% 0.26 1.22 0.38 1.37 0.84 2.87Table 1: Number of different (source) test words notseen at training time, and out-of-vocabulary rate ex-pressed as a percentage (oov%).words), 7 words are acronyms, and 4 are tokeniza-tion problems.
The 238 other words (54%) are ordi-nary words.We considered different lexicons for testing ourapproach.
These lexicons were derived from thetraining material of the shared task by training withGIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) ?default settings?two transfer tables (source-to-target and the reverse)that we intersected to remove some noise.In order to investigate how sensitive our approachis to the amount of training material available, wevaried the size of our lexicon LT by considering dif-ferent portions of the training corpus (T = 5 000,10 000, 100 000, 200 000, and 500 000 pairs of sen-tences).
The lexicon trained on the full training ma-terial (688 000 pairs of sentences), called Lref here-after, is used for validation purposes.
We kept (atmost) the 20 best associations of each source wordin these lexicons.
In practice, because we intersecttwo models, the average number of translations keptfor each source word is lower (see Table 2).Last, we collected from various target texts (En-glish here) we had at our disposal, a vocabulary setV gathering 466 439 words, that we used to filter outspurious word-forms generated by our approach.4 Experiments4.1 Translating Unknown WordsFor the three translation directions (from Span-ish, German, and French into English), we ap-plied the analogical reasoning to translate the (non-numerical) source words of the test material, absentfrom LT .
Examples of translations produced by ana-logical inference are reported in Figure 3, sorted bydecreasing order of times they have been generated.anti-agricole  (anti-farm,5) (anti-agricultural,3)(anti-rural,3) (anti-farming,3) (anti-farmer,3)fleurie  (flourishing,5) (flourished,4) (flourish,1)futilite?

The candidates re-ported are those that have been intersected with V .Translations in bold are clearly erroneous.4.1.1 BaselinesWe devised two baselines against which we com-pared our approach (hereafter ANALOG).
The firstone, BASE1, simply proposes as translations the tar-get words in the lexicon LT which are the most simi-lar (in the sense of the edit-distance) to the unknownsource word.
Naturally, this approach is only appro-priate for pairs of languages that share many cog-nates (i.e., docteur ?
doctor).
The second base-line, BASE2, is more sensible and more closely cor-responds to our approach.
We first collect a set ofsource words that are close-enough (according to theedit-distance) to the unknown word.
Those sourcewords are then projected into the output space bysimple bilingual lexicon look-up.
So for instance,the French word demanda will be translated into theEnglish word request if the French word demande isin LT and that request is one of its sanctioned trans-lations.Each of these baselines is tested in two variants.The first one (id), which allows a direct comparison,proposes as many translations as ANALOG does.
Thesecond one (10) proposes the first 10 translations ofeach unknown word.4.1.2 Automatic EvaluationEvaluating the quality of translations requires toinspect lists of words each time we want to test avariant of our approach.

A pair [n , t] in lines labeled by unk stands for thenumber of words to translate, and the average number of their translations in Lref .but happens to be in practice a delicate task.
Wetherefore decided to resort to an automatic evalua-tion procedure which relies on Lref , a bilingual lex-icon which entries are considered correct.We translated all the words of Lref absent fromLT .
We evaluated the different approaches by com-puting response and precision rates.
The responserate is measured as the percentage of words forwhich we do have at least one translation produced(correct or not).
The precision is computed in ourcase as the percentage of words for which at leastone translation is sanctioned by Lref .
Note that thisway of measuring response and precision is clearlybiased toward translation systems that can hypoth-esize several candidate translations for each word,as statistical systems usually do.
The reason of thischoice was however guided by a lack of precision ofthe reference we anticipated, a point we discuss inSection 4.1.3.The figures for the French-to-English directionare reported in Table 2.
We observe that the ratioof unknown words that get a translation by ANA-LOG is clearly impacted by the size of the lexiconLT we use for computing analogies: the larger thebetter.
This was expected since the larger a lexiconis, the higher the number of source analogies thatcan be made and consequently, the higher the num-ber of analogies that can be projected onto the out-put space.
The precision of ANALOG is rather stableacross variants and ranges between 50% to 60%.The second observation we make is that the base-lines perform worse than ANALOG in all but theL500 000 cases.
Since our baselines propose trans-lations to each source word, their response rate ismaximum.
Their precision, however, is an issue.Expectedly, BASE1 is the worst of the two baselines.If we arbitrarily fix the response rate of BASE2 to theone of ANALOG, the former approach shows a farlower precision (e.g., 34.4 against 59.4 for L200 000).This not only indicates that analogical learning ishandling unknown words better than BASE2, but aswell, that a combination of both approaches couldpotentially yield further improvements.A last observation concerns the fact that ANALOGperforms equally well on the out-domain material.This is very important from a practical point of viewand contrasts with some related work we discuss inSection 5.At first glance, the fact that BASE2 outperformsANALOG on the larger training size is disappoint-ing.
After investigations, we came to the conclusionthat this is mainly due to two facts.
First, the num-882ber of unknown words on which both systems weretested is rather low in this particular case (e.g., 34for the in-domain corpus).
Second, we noticed a de-ficiency of the reference lexicon Lref for many ofthose words.
After all, this is not surprising sincethe words unseen in the 500 000 pairs of trainingsentences, but encountered in the full training cor-pus (688 000 pairs) are likely to be observed only afew times, therefore weakening the associations au-tomatically acquired for these entries.
We evaluatethat a third of the reference translations were wrongin this setting, which clearly raises some doubts onour automatic evaluation procedure in this case.The performance of ANALOG across the three lan-guage pairs are reported in Table 3.
We observe adrop of performance of roughly 10% (both in preci-sion and response) for the German-to-English trans-lation direction.
This is likely due to the heuris-tic procedure we apply during the search for stems,which is not especially well suited for handling com-pound words that are frequent in German.We observe that for Spanish- and German-to-English translation directions, the precision ratetends to decrease for larger values of T .
One ex-planation for that is that we consider all analogiesequally likely in this work, while we clearly notedthat some are spurious ones.
With larger trainingmaterial, spurious analogies become more likely.French Spanish GermanT p% r% p% r% p% r%5 51.4 30.7 52.8 30.3 49.3 23.110 55.3 44.4 52.0 45.2 47.6 33.350 58.8 64.3 54.0 66.5 44.6 53.2100 58.2 65.1 53.9 69.1 45.8 55.6200 59.4 65.2 46.4 71.8 43.0 59.2Table 3: Performance across language pairs mea-sured on test-in.
The number T of pairs of sen-tences used for training LT is reported in thousands.We measured the impact the translations producedby ANALOG have on a state-of-the-art phrase-basedtranslation engine, which is described in (Patry etal., 2006).
For that purpose, we extended a phrase-table with the first translation proposed by ANALOGor BASE2 for each unknown word of the test ma-terial.
Results in terms of word-error-rate (WER)and BLEU score (Papineni et al, 2002) are reportedin Table 4 for those sentences that contain at leastone unknown word.
Small but consistent improve-ments are observed for both metrics with ANALOG.This was expected, since the original system sim-ply leaves the unknown words untranslated.
Whatis more surprising is that the BASE2 version slightlyunderperforms the baseline.
The reason is that someunknown words that should appear unmodified ina translation, often get an erroneous translation byBASE2.
Forcing BASE2 to propose a translationfor the same words for which ANALOG found one,slightly improves the figures (BASE2id).French Spanish GermanWER BLEU WER BLEU WER BLEUbase 61.8 22.74 54.0 27.00 69.9 18.15+BASE2 61.8 22.72 54.2 26.89 70.3 18.05+BASE2id 61.7 22.81 54.1 27.01 70.1 18.14+ANALOG 61.6 22.90 53.7 27.27 69.7 18.30sentences 387 452 814Table 4: Translation quality produced by our phrase-based SMT engine (base) with and without thefirst translation produced by ANALOG, BASE2, orBASE2id for each unknown word.4.1.3 Manual EvaluationAs we already mentioned, the lexicon used as areference in our automatic evaluation procedure isnot perfect, especially for low frequency words.
Wefurther noted that several words receive valid trans-lations that are not sanctioned by Lref .
This is forinstance the case of the examples in Figure 4, wherecircumventing and fellow are arguably legitimatetranslations of the French words contournant andconcitoyen, respectively.
Note that in the second ex-ample, the reference translation is in the plural formwhile the French word is not.Therefore, we conducted a manual evaluation ofthe translations produced from L100 000 by ANA-LOG and BASE2 on the 127 French words of thecorpus test-in8 unknown of Lref .

75 (60%) ofthose words received at least one valid translationby ANALOG while only 63 (50%) did by BASE2.Among those words that received (at least) one validtranslation, 61 (81%) were ranked first by ANA-LOG against only 22 (35%) by BASE2.
We fur-ther observed that among the 52 words that did notreceive a valid translation by ANALOG, 38 (73%)did not receive a translation at all.
Those untrans-lated words are mainly proper names (bush), foreignwords (munere), and compound words (rhe?nanie-du-nord-westphalie), for which our approach is notespecially well suited.We conclude from this informal evaluation that80% of ordinary unknown words received a validtranslation in our French-to-English experiment, andthat roughly the same percentage had a valid trans-lation proposed in the first place by ANALOG.4.2 Translating Unknown PhrasesOur approach is not limited to translate solely un-known words, but might serve as well to enrichexisting entries in a lexicon.
For instance, low-frequency words, often poorly handled by currentstatistical methods, could receive useful translations.This is illustrated in Figure 5 where we report thebest candidates produced by ANALOG for the Frenchword invite?es, which appears 7 times in the 200 000invite?e (61 candidates)ANALOG  (invited,135) (requested,92) (cal-led,77) (urged,75) (guest,72) (asked,47) (re-quest,43) (invites,27) (invite,26) (urge,26)L200 000  asked, generate, urgedFigure 5: 10 best candidates produced by ANALOGfor the low-frequency French word invite?es and itstranslations in L200 000.first pairs of the training corpus.
Interestingly, ANA-LOG produced the candidate guest which corre-sponds to a legitimate meaning of the French wordthat was absent in the training data.Because it can treat separators as any other char-acter, ANALOG is not bounded to translate onlywords.
As a proof of concept, we applied analogicalreasoning to translate those source sequences of atmost 5 words in the test material that contain an un-known word.
Since there are many more sequencesthan there are words, the input space in this exper-iment is far larger, and we had to resort to a muchmore aggressive pruning technique to find the stemsof the sequences to be translated.expulsent  (expelling,36) (expel,31) (are ex-pelling,23) (are expel,10)focaliserai  (focus,10) (focus solely,9) (concen-trate all,9) (will focus,9) (will placing,9)de?passeront  (will exceed,4) (exceed,3) (will beexceed,3) (we go beyond,2) (will be exceeding,2)non-re?ussite de  (lack of success for,4) (lack ofsuccess of,4) (lack of success,4)que vous subissez  (you are experiencing,2)Figure 6: Examples of translations produced byANALOG where the input (resp.
output) space isdefined by the set of source (resp.

Words in bold are unknown.We applied the automatic evaluation proceduredescribed in Section 4.1.2 for the French-to-Englishtranslation direction, with a reference lexicon beingthis time the phrase table acquired on the full train-ing material.9 The response rate in this experiment isparticularly low since only a tenth of the sequences9This model contains 1.5 millions pairs of phrases.884received (at least) a translation by ANALOG.
Thoseare short sequences that contain at most three words,which clearly indicates the limitation of our prun-ing strategy.
Among those sequences that receivedat least one translation, the precision rate is 55%,which is consistent with the rate we measured whiletranslating words.Examples of translations are reported in Figure 6.We observe that single words are not contrived any-more to be translated by a single word.
This allowsto capture 1:n relations such as de?passeront?willexceed, where the future tense of the French word isadequately rendered by the modal will in English.5 Related WorkWe are not the first to consider the translation of un-known words or phrases.
Several authors have forinstance proposed approaches for translating propernames and named entities (Chen et al, 1998; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002).
Our approach is com-plementary to those ones.Recently and more closely related to the approachwe described, Callison-Burch et al (2006) proposedto replace an unknown phrase in a source sentenceby a paraphrase.
Paraphrases in their work are ac-quired thanks to a word alignment computed overa large external set of bitexts.
One important dif-ference between their work and ours is that our ap-proach does not require additional material.10 In-deed, they used a rather idealistic set of large, ho-mogeneous bitexts (European parliament debates) toacquire paraphrases from.
Therefore we feel our ap-proach is more suited for translating ?low density?languages and languages with a rich morphology.Several authors considered as well the translationof new words by relying on distributional colloca-tional properties computed from a huge non-parallelcorpus (Rapp, 1999; Fung and Yee, 1998; Takaakiand Matsuo, 1999; Koehn and Knight, 2002).
Evenif admittedly non-parallel corpora are easier to ac-quire than bitexts, this line of work is still heavilydependent on huge external resources.Most of the analogies made at the word level inour study are capturing morphological information.10We do use a target vocabulary list to filter out spuriousanalogies, but we believe we could do without.
The frequencywith which we generate a string could serve to decide upon itslegitimacy.The use of morphological analysis in (statistical)machine translation has been the focus of severalstudies, (Nie?en, 2002) among the first.
Depend-ing on the pairs of languages considered, gains havebeen reported when the training material is of mod-est size (Lee, 2004; Popovic and Ney, 2004; Gold-water and McClosky, 2005).
Our approach does notrequire any morphological knowledge of the source,the target, or both languages.
Admittedly, severalunsupervised morphological induction methodolo-gies have been proposed, e.g., the recent approachin Freitag (2005).
In any case, as we have shown,ANALOG is not bounded to treat only words, whichwe believe to be at our advantage.6 Discussion and Future WorkIn this paper, we have investigated the appropri-ateness of analogical learning to handle unknownwords in machine translation.
On the contrary toseveral lines of work, our approach does not rely onmassive additional resources but capitalizes insteadon an information which is inherently pertaining tothe language.
We measured that roughly 80% of or-dinary unknown French words can receive a validtranslation into English with our approach.This work is currently being developed in severaldirections.
First, we are investigating why our ap-proach remains silent for some words or phrases.This will allow us to better characterize the limita-tions of ANALOG and will hopefully lead us to de-sign a better strategy for identifying the stems of agiven word or phrase.
Second, we are investigat-ing how a systematic enrichment of a phrase-transfertable will impact a phrase-based statistical machinetranslation engine.
Last, we want to investigate thetraining of a model that can learn regularities fromthe analogies we are making.
This would relieve usfrom requiring the training material while translat-ing, and would allow us to compare our approachwith other methods proposed for unsupervised mor-phology acquisition.Acknowledgement We are grateful to the anony-mous reviewers for their useful suggestions and toPierre Poulin for his fruitful comments.
