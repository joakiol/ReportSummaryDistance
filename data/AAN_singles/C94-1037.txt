"DERIVAT IONA12 '  PARADIGMS IN MORPHONOLOGY.Vito Pirrell i ,  Stefano Federic iI LC -CNR,  Par .O .La  sas - Pisa ( Italy)INTRODUCTION.Traditionally, paradigms were used to deal withinflection in inflectionally rich hlnguages.
Only recently(Calder, 1989; Carstairs-McCarthy, I988, 1992)paradigms have been the object or a far-reachinginvestigaticm covering their formal and conlputationalproperties.
This investigation has higbligthed thesignif icance of a paradigm-based treatment ofmorphonological phenonlena and its theoreticalimplications.
In this paper, we show how derivationalprocesses in Morpho logy  can be treatedparad igmat ica l ly  by  using a mtn'llhonologicalnetwork.
The approach is not only theoreticalspeculation but has been subjected to the practical test ofa computer implementation.
This implementation leads,in our opinion, to a conceptually and conqJutationallyeleane, treatment of Morphonology.1 T I lE  PROBI~EM.There are two basic ways to relate a pair ofnlorpllouological representations deriwit lonMly: 1)to take either o1' them as bslsic, arid derive tile other rronlit via a llrocess of rule-governed phonological change(Fig.
I below); 2) to asstune a third representation(somewhat intermediate between the two) as underlying,and make tile other two derive I'rt)ln it either bysubstitution of some phonological segments, or byfilling in an underspecified phonological representation(Fig.2 below).b)pro 'fawndc/ 1pro'f ^ nditiFig.
I base-derivative relation in MorphonologyHereafter, we will refer to both I) arm 2) asder ivat ional  accounts of morphonological relations.Usually, sohition 1 stores the basic form only in thelexicon, while tile derivative is, sis it were, cranked outon demand by rule application I.
On the other hand,sohttion 2 requires that only one underlying, abstractrepresentation be stored in the lexicon: the two relatedtbrms are yielded from their common lexical source byrules.
If b and c sire the nlorphonological representationsto relate, the two approaches can be illustrated as shownin Figg.

2 abstract representations slnd morphonologicalrelationsThis assumption stumbles upon a nmnber ofdifficulties.
Let us consider a small but crucial portionof English segmental Phonology as classically analysedsince Clmmsky ,'lnd llalle (1968).
First, schwa is wellknown to alternate with full vowels within thePllonology of English.
l)erivational series such sis inI:ig.3 below show tllat full vowels under stresscorresp(md to schwas in unstressed llOSilions.\['fowtagrgef\] / \[fowtffgra3fik\] / \[fo'ta grofi\]Fig.
3 derivational lternationsThis alternation is captured by a rule of vowelreduction: full vowels are reduced to schwa in unstressedposition (e.g., I',el -> schwa in photography).
Anothersystematic l~honological ternation in English involvesderivational pairs such as sane-xmfity (l'sejnl/l's,'eniti\]),which strongly suggest a derivational rule like ej -> m.Ilowever, other alternations appear to go in Ihe oppositedirection.
For example in a triple like morginsl1Alternatively, both representations can be stored in{he Lexicon, and related through tile slatemcnt of somercchmdancy Icxical rule (lstckendoff, 1975).234hnar?inalily/marginGlia, the following alternation inthe underlined vowel emerges: schwa/~e/ej.
If we posit/~e/as underlying, then we end up having to set up anlie/ -> /ej/ change, which is tile mirro,+-image of the/ej/->ke/ relation posited for tim derivational l)air\['sejn\]/l'smniti\] (more on this ill l)urand, 1990).The sohttion illustrated in Fig.2 above is a way tosolve this apparent paradox.
A third abstract segment/,'e:/ is assulned to be basic rehltive to /schwa/``e/ejt.This means that /schwa/m/e j /can be derived from/m:/through application of some phonohigieal rules.
Aderivational chain of this sort can be ralher conlplex,since I',e:/and lej/are, phonokigically, far removed fromeach other, and ninny intermediate changes can he needed(as i l l  I'me:nl -> I'se:nl -> I'se:inl -> I'sejnl; sue tlalleand Mohanan,  (1985) for more examples).
Morereservations on chains of lifts sort have been expressedrecently in a series of psycholinguistic experintents,aimed ill probing the reality of tile derivationalasstunptions (Jaeger, 1986; Wang and Derwing, 1986).ht the literature, an allogether different ai)proachfroiI1 both derivational accounls I) and 2) al)ove has beensuggested (Vennemann, 1974): b and e should simply belisled in the Lexicon, one beside the other, On :l par:pro 'fawnd -..91 I-,.- pr o'f ^ nditiFig.
4 mo,phonological relations and lexical listingFormulated in this wily, tile relation in l:igA isalways "true on the surface", shlce there is no abstractrepresentation i volved ill this account.
Moreover, norule ordering p loblems arise (i.e., concerning tiltdirection of the arrow).
If the sohltion in Fig.4 isadopted, however, it is not at all clear what type oflexical architecture one is suggesting: i.e., it is mootwhether b and c are sontehow related in Ihe lexicon, orthey are simply listed together.
More worringly, tiltnotion "true on tile surface" is of little theoretical helpfor explaining sotne well-known eases of alternalion.Take, for example, the opposition between tile AmericanEnglish pronunciation of writer and rider, respectivelyh'ajVerl and/ra:jV'er/, where hoth /t/ and /d/ have beenturned into aflap (\[ l ' \]).
If lhe only difference betweenthe two phonological realizations is the surface-truelengthening of ~ill in /ra:jVel'/, then one is nlissing therelation between vowel length and tile verbal b,'tses ofthe two derivatives, a relation liutt represents animportant,  product ive general izat ion within theAmerican English phonological system (l)urand, 1990).An American English speaker, when asked to derive anew agentive in -er  from verbs ending in /t/, willproduce flapping with no lengthening.
In contrast, (s)hewill produce both a lengthened vowel and a flap if tilebase is a verb ending in /d/.
Derivational acct:,tmtscapture this generalization in an elegant way, throughrule ordering: vowel lengthening takes place beforeflapping does, in the context "vowel followed by avoiced consonant",  so that when either /t/ or /d/disappears, lengthening has idready applied (OF failed to).ht contrast, accounts based on lexical lisling al+e cleaHyincapable of grasping this significant hidden relation,since the opposition between/ I /and/d / i s  no longer trueon the surface in pairs such as /rail 'er/ vs /ra:i l  'er / ,where the opposition is neutralized by a flalxTo sum up, der ivat iona l  accot ln ts  ofnmrphonologica l  a l ternat ions \[','Ice a ntunber oftheoretical and practical pl'olflenm.
Ill what follows, wewill illustrate the working of a set of analogy-basedprinciples and tile design of a general parallel architecturefor their implementation.
These principles dispense withboth I'Ule ordering and Stlrfilce tllltl'tle representations hyusing l)aradigms of alternations instead of derivationalchains.
The intplemented architecture proves to beaccurate and COml)utationally eflicienl.2 T I lE  GI,:NI,:RAI, MOI ) i~L .In this section tile idea is illustrated that redundanciesamong linguistic data can he used to convey interestingl inguistic general izations if (.lain lll'e slored ill anincremental network, l.et us consider the general casefirst, exemplified by the following list of abstract casesand their categorial classification:137 x037 x33"/ xSUl)lmSe that tile sequence of nunterals 137represents tile Iorm of a linguistic ot:iect (say a word); xis its category.
We can represent these dala by exploitingtile redundancies that they show at both tile lbrnml andcategorial level of description as follows:3<=> XFig.

In Fig.6 o isanother possible cutegory (different from x), and 38 <=>o aYiotl)er nucleus.
Given a network like this, networkcores are ac t ivated  hy an input string if they arecontained by it.
The nelwork output will then be thecalcgory associated with the actiwltcd core.2352363<=> X4<=> 0Fig.
6 riwfl cores in a multicategory networkMore concretely, if a certain lbrm, say 437, ix givenas input to the network, the system tries to guess theright category on the basis of the analogy of 437 (calledthe target  s t r ing)  with already stored items (calledbase  s t r ings) .
This is carried out through thelbllowing steps.
Network cores are activalcd by 437:this is done through a simple string-matching routine 2.For example, 37 will be actiwtted, and its category x ix acandidate response of the system for the input 437.
Whathappens when more than one core gets activated by thesame input token?
If the activated cores have the samecategory, the corresponding mtdtiple responses wouldreinforce each other: the only category activated is givenas OUtl~Ut.
The case of multiple responses with differentcategories (and thus potentially different outputs) ismore complex.
We can dislinguish two cases:I) there is no core which is fully act ivated2) there ix at least one fully act ivated core.A core is fully activated when it is entirely containedby the input string: in the example above 437 fullyactiwttes the core -37.
This contrasts with partialactivation, when the core is only partially contained bythe input string: for example, 437 partMly activates thecore -38 of Fig.6 above, since it contains 3 in thesecond position, but not 8 in the third.
Let ns considercase 1) above first, l\[' there is no core which is fullyactivated, then the system goes through the followingtwo steps: la)  for each candidate response, the systemgauges an Act ivat ion  Ratio:number of numerals (+1 theactivated core contained in inputtotal number of numerals in theactNated coreThe actiwttion ratio (AcR) is then 0 < AcR _< I. Thecase of full actiwttion (AcR= 1) is dealt with in 2); lb)the core with the highest AcR wins out over the others.Let us consider now case 2).
If there exists at leastone fully activated core, then two I'urfl~er subcases needbe distinguished: 2a) there is only one core which isfully activated: the category borne out by that core is2 More on string-matching will be said in section 4 ofthis papcr.then picked up; 2b) there are at least two cores whichare fully activated.
2a) can be seen as a degenerate case of1) above, when AcR = I.
As to 2b), in this case theactivation ratio is clearly no longer conclusive.
Oneneeds to gauge :t further ratio, called Analogy Ratio,whose definition follows:total number of numerals in theactivated coretotal number of numeralsin input&gain, the analogy ratio (AnR) is 0 < AnR _< 13.To stnn up, a certain pattern is analogic,'dly activatedif the following conditions are met in tiffs order:I) it is activated by an input pair2) it has got the highest activation ratio3) it has got the highest analogy ratioSo far, we have been assenting that the networkproduces cores incrementally as more data .

Infact, the nc lwork  p fogress ive ly  ex l racts  re t lnced  cores.Each full form is aheady a core in its own right,otherwise it would never get activated.
The exmtction ofsmaller cores represents the process of acquir inggeneralizations on the basis of the analogy between data(redundancies).
In the network, an exception is simplyan isolated case, that is a nucleus which is fullyactiwtted only when it is witnessed in input in itsenlircty (AnR = I).3 AN ANAI~OGY-BASH)  NETWORKFOIl.

A flap (will\] nolengthening) would then automatically appear ill theplace of surface \[-t\], according to tile following steps: a)the input conditions are represented by the lexicalcontent o1' the verb l ight (w in Fig.9-i), and thecategorial information "agentive nominalization" (o inFig.9); b) w actiw~tes the \[1\] of \[lajtl ill the paradignl i)of Fig.9 above; e) tim activated core o triggers the flapalternation \[-aj F'er\] of word-final \[-ajt\] in Fig.9-i, and thealte,'nation \[a:jF'er\] of word final \[-a:jd\] in Fig.9-ii; d)the form \['lajFer\] is thus produced, since there is a palhof pradigmatic links between \[ll .

Webelieve that this solution is empirically superior to tileAnaximander's principle invoked by \[ludson (1974), tothe effect that, since there exists no clear-cut distinctionbetween suppletions and systematic alternations, all ofthem should be listed in the lexicon.4 L IM ITS  OF T I lE  MOI )EL  ANDFURTI IER  IMPROVEMENTS.The network has been implemented in C, andproved to be 95% accurate in analysis after a training on20,000 Italian word forms, and 75% accurate illsynthesi , as reported in Pirrelli and Federici (1991).These performances have been obtained hy using tilesimplified model illusm~ted here.It should he noted, however, that this model workswell for the Morphology of Ihose hmguages (such asItalian and English) where affixation is commonlyrealized through aconcatenative operation (surfixation orprel'ixation).
In these cases, string-matching is a fairlysimple head-and-tail operation.
Clearly, this model is farfrom having a universal, cross-linguistic wdiditythough.
For example, it does not work well with casesof circumfixation (known also as parasynthesis), letalone tile Morphology of nonconcatenative l'mguages.Nevertheless, we contend that the set of analogy-basedprinciples illustrated here hold Ibr a wider spectrum orhmguages than purely concatenative ones: by makingstring-nmtehing a more flexible and powerful operation,we can successfully adapt our model to the requirenaentsof noncatenative languages uch as Arabic, or Io thetreatment of discontinuous affixation.
What rollowssketchily illustrates this line of develoI-m/ent.
(liven two strings of characters/phonemes to match(called tbe base and tile target string), the new string-matching algor ithm (d iscont inuous  s t r ing -match ing)  we are currently expe,'inaenting on is,informally:smrt fi'om the h'ft corner of both the target and basestring and scan them rightwards; extract, down the way,all characterdphonemes which appear in both, and inthe same order.Take tile Italian word forms \[inve'k:jarel(inveechiare, English 'to age' a parasynthelic verbalderivative of the adjective vecchio,  'old '4) and\[intimi'direl ( intimidire, English 'to make shy,intinaid:ltc', a parasynthetic derivative of timido, 'timid,shy'), or the Arabic pair \[knlaybl ('little dog') and \[kalbl('dog') ill the diagrams ill Fig.
