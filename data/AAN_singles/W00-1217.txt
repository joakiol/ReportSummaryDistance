How Should a Large Corpus Be Built?-A Comparative Study ofClosure in AAnnotated Newspaper Corpora from Two ChineseSources, Towards Building A Larger Representative CorpusMerged from Representative Sublanguage CollectionsJ ohn  Kovar ik  (kovar iks@wor ldnet .a t t .net )U.S. Department of DefenseAbst rac tThis study measures comparative lexical andsyntactic closure rates in annotated Chinesenewspaper corpora from the Academica SinicaBalanced Corpus and the University of Penn-sylvania's Chinese Treebank.
It then draws in-ferences as to how large such corpora need beto be representative models of subject-matter-constrained language domains within the samegenre.
Future large corpora should be built in-crementally only by combining smaller repre-sentative sublanguage collections.1 P r io r  WorkPractically speaking, earlier attempts at build-ing corpora, such as the IBM/Lancaster ap-proach, have taken an all-inclusive perspectivetoward text selection proposing that (Garsideand McEnery, 1993) raw texts for parsed cor-pora should come from a variety of sources.The IBM/Lancaster group used the CanadianHansards collection of parallel parsed Englishand French sentences as a base of English parsedsentences and then focused on the ComputerManuals domain, in which they attempted torandomly select exts with some additional non-Computer Manual material selected as "a mea-sure of 'light relief' " supposedly for the benefitof the annotators.
A broad approach was alsoused in the Hong Kong element of the Interna-tional Corpus of English (ICE) project (Green-baum, 1992) which sought o assemble a rangeof both spoken and written texts along witha range of both formal and informal situationsto provide a reasonably large, well-documentedand detailed snapshot of the use of educatedEnglish.
(Bolt, 1994) Both the IBM/Lancasterapproach and the ICE project build millions oftokens worth of corpora.But from a more principled perspective, Dou-glas Biber, in speaking on representativenessin corpus design, pointed out that the linguis-tic characterization f a corpus should includeboth its central tendency and its range of varia-tion.
(Biber, 1993)Similarly Geoffrey Leech hasstated that a corpus, in order to be representa-tive, must somehow capture the magnitude oflanguages not only in their lexis but also in theirsyntax.
(Leech, 1991) This suggests we shouldbuild corpora focusing on how well they can ap-proach lexical and syntactic losure, rather thanby merely fixating on ever larger amounts oftext.
To build representative corpora why notfirst select representative texts constrained bygenre of writing?In general one possible technique for methodi-cal corpus selection would be to build large cor-pora out of representative sub-collections con-strained by genre and subject matter.
ZeligHarris said, "Certain proper subsets of the sen-tences of a language may be closed under someor all of the operations defined in the language,and thus constitute a sublanguage of it."
(Har-ris, 1968) Calling this an inductive definitionof sublanguage Satoshi Sekine has embarked onstudies involving new trends in the analysis ofsublanguages (Sekine, 1994).
Both Harris andSekine recognized that sublanguages are an effi-cient way to observe and measure the propertiesof natural language in smaller, representativeblocks.Getting down to specifics, McEnery and Wil-son (McEnery and Wilson, 1996) have hypoth-esized that genres of writing, such as the styleused in newspapers and similar printed publi-cations to report news stories, represent a con-strained subset of a natural language.
Thusnewspaper texts constitute a sublanguage - aversion of a natural language which does notdisplay all of the creativity of that natural an-116guage.
The newspaper sublanguage can be fur-ther constrained by subject matter to divide itinto smaller, more manageable subsets.A key mathematical feature of a sublanguageis that it will show a high degree of closureat various levels of description, setting it apartfrom unconstrained natural anguage.
This clo-sure property of a sublanguage is analogous tothe mathematical property of transitive closure.McEnery and Wilson used the closure propertyto measure and compare rates of lexical and syn-tactic closure in three corpora: the IBM com-puter manual corpus, the Canadian Hansards,and the American Printing House for the Blindcorpus.
To date, however, there has been littlework in a similar vein in other languages.2 Overv iewThis work applies the methodology of McEneryand Wilson to examine closure rates in a com-parative study of all available tagged Chinesenewspaper corpora.
First I define lexical andsyntactic closure for this study in section 3.Then, section 4 begins this study with an exam-ination of ~ the newspaper texts of the Aca-demica Sinica Balanced Corpus (ASBC).
Sec-tion 5 extends this study to an examination ofthe newspaper texts of the UPenn Chinese Tree-bank (CTB).
Section 6 presents my findings andsection 7 discusses ome implications for futurecorpus building.3 Lex ica l  and  Syntact i c  C losure3.1 Tokenizat ion in Ch ineseIt should be pointed out that Chinese is an ag-glutinative, not an inflected language.
More-over, while Chinese tokens can concatenate,Chinese has no extensive morphology like manyIndo-European languages.
Chinese, of course,has no white space separating lexemes, as a re-sult, all Chinese text must first be segmentedinto word lengths.
However, once a text hasbeen segmented, no stemming is needed so eachsegmented Chinese word can be counted as itoccurs without the need of finding its lemma.3.2 " Lexical C losureLexical closure is that property of a collection oftext whereby given a representative sample, thenumber of new lexical forms seen among everyadditional 1,000 new tokens begins to level offat a rate below 10 per cent.3.3 Syntactic ClosureSyntactic losure is that property of a collectionof text whereby given a representative sample ofa type of text, then the number of new syntac-tic forms seen among every additional 1,000 newtokens begins to level off.
A syntactic form isthe combination of token plus type.
Thus syn-tactic closure approaches as the number of newgrammatical uses for a previously observed to-ken plus the number of new tokens, regardlessof syntactic use, level off to a growth rate below10 per cent.4 Academica  S in ica  Ba lancedCorpus  (ASBC)While it is common practice to attempt to buildhuge annotated corpora, it is of course very te-dious, very expensive, and especially challeng-ing for annotators to maintain consistency oversuch a huge task.
Consequently one must hopethat once an annotated corpus of newspapertexts is created, it can be statistically measuredand confirmed to be a representative sample.I first measured lexical and syntactic closurerates in all ASBC newspaper texts but foundthat when viewed as a whole this newspapersub-collection of the ASBC does not approachclosure (see graphs below).i i.ii:::; :: ?i iiii  ii 1... ~: .

I searched the ASBC corpus lookingfor files of annotated newspaper text and founda total of 57 files (18.7 Mb); my findings aresummarized in the following table.Academica Sinica Balanced Corpus NewsFries Size05 01.9Mb16 01.5Mb01 00.2Mb36 15.1MbFilenames Subject MatterA .... '94 AcademicsC .... '93 Various NewsSSSLA '91 Politics etc.T .... '91-'95 Sports etc.The large single file, n~.med "SSLA', dealtwith a wide assortment of subject matter andthus was significantly different from the other 3newspaper collections.
Not only was its individ-ual file size rather large; it was not even closeto the size and homogeneity of the other threenewspaper multi-file collections.
I rejected itfrom further study.The other sub-collections were more similar.Topically speaking, the ASBC "A" newspapercollection was focused primarily on news (77 percent) while at the same time focusing narrowlyon academic events in 1994.
The ASBC "C"newspaper collection was less narrowly focusedon news (73.5 per cent) but expanded its fo-cus to other than academia while limiting it-self to events of 1993.
The ASBC "T" news-paper collection, however, spanned the period1991 through 1995 and dealt with many differ-ent subjects, the most frequent of which weresports, news, and domestic politics, but eveneach of these most frequent subjects only repre-sented 9 per cent of the whole.Let us consider the three ASBC newspapersub-collections ("A' ,  "C' ,  and "T" filenames)to be potentially representative sublanguages.If we can observe relatively high degrees of clo-sure at various levels of description, we can pro-pose that such sub-collections are representa-tive sublanguages within the newspaper genreof Chinese natural anguage.
Conversely, thosewhich do not have a high degrees of closure aredefinitely not sublanguage corpora and not offurther interest for this study.
The followinggraphs depict the observed lexical and syntac-tic closure rates of the three ASBC newspapersub-collections under study.ROCUng A ?

t"l'?lae=t=6 F ind ingsThe UPenn data initially approaches lexical andsyntactic closure at a rate which can be fa-vorably compared with the ASBC "A" Chinesenewspaper sub-corpus.
By the time 59,000 to-kens of the UPenn corpus were ta~ed,  only 56new token+tag combinations were observed inthe preceding 1,000 tokens and 27 of those werenew proper nouns.
In comparison, at this pointthe closure rate in the ASBC "A" corpus wasnot quite as good (see table below).
But contin-uing to the 69,000 token mark, the ASBC =A"closure rate had overtaken that of the UPennCTB.Tokens Corpus59,000 UPenn CTB; ASBC A"69~000 ;'"UPenn CTBI ASBC ANew token+tags56 ~27 ~R)77 (34 N...)6z (36 Nit)6 : (~9 N...)InterestingJy the graphs for both the ASBC"A" and the UPenn CTB data reveal two-humped curves.

Some day corpuslinguistics may only need much smaller collec-tions of annotated corpora than is the practicetoday, relying on new directions in sublanguageresearch.
In the case of the ASBC "A" col-lection, for example, a robust learning struc-ture should be able to build a useable modelon 100,000 words worth of data like this Whichexhibits strong tendencies to lexical and syn-tactic closure in the Chinese newspaper genreconstrained to a given domain.If the UPenn CTB were enlarged by the in-fusion of more news stories on internationalaspects of Chinese economic development, theCTB might better reach lexical and syntacticclosure.
The following graph shows that theblind addition of 20K additional Chinese eco-nomic news stories does not aid closure much.This additional data spanned many topics notseen in the original 100K collection.
If it hadbeen selected precisely to aid closure by mea-suring its potential contribution before exten-sive hand annotation, the result could have beenbetter.d.OKAugaer~d ~ L,gxical C lomi ."

i ):+ ~, 1TQk~ I'1$8 D iscuss ionSince only two Chinese tagged corpora re avail-able at the present ime, only about 200,000words of Chinese corpora have been so stud-ied.
But to see more work in this vein, oneneed only consult McEnery and Wilson's studyof three English corpora: the IBM computermanual corpus, the Canadian Hansards, and theAmerican Printing House for the Blind corpus(McEnery and Wilson, 1996).
Their study (ex-haustively detailed in Chapter 6 of their book)spans more than 2.2 million words of taggedEnglish text in three different domains.
Con-sequently the total of 2.3 million words fromMcEnery and Wilson's results in tagged En-glish texts when combined with these results intagged Chinese newspaper texts should satisfyany who might argue that there is insufficientdata upon which to draw some general conclu-sions.This paper does not argue that the two clo-sure measures used are the only measures pos-sible.
The argument here is simply that thesetwo closure measures are used to spot when asublanguage corpus approaches closure--that is,when the curve of new types?
and new combina-tions of type with token begins to flatten at arate below ten percent.
One can readily pointout that no natural anguage corpus can everguarantee closure.
The best anyone can aspireto do today, given the current state of our art,is to only approach closure.9 ReferencesReferencesD.
