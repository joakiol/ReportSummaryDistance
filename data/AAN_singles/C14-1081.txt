Traditionally, they were considered as separate tasks and solved inde-pendently.
In this paper, we investigate the high correlation and mutual influence between socialactions (i.e.
user-behavior interactions) and social ties (i.e.
user-user connections).
We propose aunified coherent framework, namely mutual latent random graphs (MLRGs), to flexibly encodeevidences from both social actions and social ties.
We introduce latent, or hidden factors andcoupled models with users, users?
behaviors and users?
relations to exploit mutual influence andmutual benefits between social actions and social ties.
We propose a gradient based optimizationalgorithm to efficiently learn the model parameters.
Experimental results show the validity andcompetitiveness of our model, compared to several state-of-the-art alternative models.1 IntroductionWith the dramatically rapid growth and great success of many large-scale online social networking ser-vices, social media bridge our daily physical life and the virtual Web space.
Popular social media sites(e.g., Facebook and Twitter) and mobile social networks (e.g., Foursquare) have gathered billions of act-ing users and are still attracting millions of newbies everyday.
Modeling social actions and social tiesare two fundamental tasks in online social media.
Social actions are the users?
activities or behaviorsin socially connected networks.
For example, a social action can be ?posting a tweet?
on Twitter or the?check-in?
behavior on Foursquare.
A social tie or social relation is referred to any relationship betweentwo or more individual users in a social network, such as the friend and colleague relationships.
Byunderstanding a user?s behaviors and accordingly exploiting potentially interesting services to her/him,one can improve the user?s experience and boost the revenue of social media sites.
Also, precise socialtie prediction will help people tap into the wisdom of crowds, to aid in making more informed decisions.Since individual users are socially connected, social influence occurs through information diffusionin social networks.
Social influence happens when one?s opinions or behaviors are affected by others.It is well known that different types of social ties have essentially different influence on social actions.Intuitively, a user?s trusted friends on the web affect that user?s online behavior.
Ma et al.
(2009) and Maet al.
(2011) claimed that one user?s final behavior decision is the balance between his/her own taste andher/his trusted friends?
favors.
On the other hand, social actions also have important influence on socialties.
Obviously, users with similar preferences or behaviors are more likely to be friends than others insocial media.
Users with momentous activities will attract many other users to be connected with.
Onthe contrary, no body will be interested in users with trivial or insignificant behaviors.Consequently, we face some very interesting questions: Is there any dynamics or mutual influencebetween social actions and social ties?
To what extent do they influence each other?
A fundamentalmechanism that drives the dynamics of networks is the underlying social phenomenon of homophily(McPherson et al., 2001): people tend to follow the behaviors of their friends, and people tend to createrelationships with other people who are already similar to them.
This suggests that both actions and tiesThis work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

This mutual latent random graph(MLRG) framework incorporates shared latent factors with users, users?
behaviors and users?
relations,and defines coupled models to encode both social action and social tie information, to capture dynamicsand mutual influence between them.
We propose a gradient based algorithm for learning and optimiza-tion.
During the learning procedure, social actions (i.e.
user-behavior interactions), social ties (i.e.user-user connections), and deep dependencies and interactions between them could be efficiently ex-plored.
Experimental results demonstrate that social actions and social ties are highly correlated andmutually helpful.
By coupling actions with ties jointly in a single coherent framework, MLRG achievessignificantly better performance on both social action prediction and social tie inference, compared tostate-of-the-art systems modeling them independently.2 Related WorkSocial network analysis has attracted much interest in both academia and industry recently.
Consider-able research and engineering has been conducted for social media modeling, analytics and optimization,including social community detection (Fortunato, 2010), user behavior modeling and prediction ( (Ben-evenuto et al., 2009), (Kwak et al., 2010), (Ma et al., 2009), (Ma et al., 2011)), social tie analysis( (Tang et al., 2011), (Tang et al., 2012)), social sentiment analysis ( (Wasserman et al., 1994), (Pangand Lee, 2008)), etc.Social action prediction and social tie discovery are two fundamental tasks for social media and socialnetwork analysis.
Traditionally, they were considered as separate tasks and solved independently withoutconsidering the bidirectional interactions and interdependencies between them.
Social action investiga-tion is essentially important in online social media.
Users behaviors could be affected by various kinds ofcomplex factors, such as users?
attributes, users?s historical behaviors, social influence and social networkstructures.
Based on this motivation, Tan et al.
(2010) proposed a noise tolerant time-varying model totrack social actions.
Aiming at modeling user actions more accurately and realistically, Ma et al.
(2009)and Ma et al.
(2011) considered connections among users and proposed social trust ensemble to fusethe users?
tastes and their trusted friends?
favors together.
Gao et al.
(2013) investigated users?
socialbehaviors from a spatio-temporal-social aspect in location-based mobile social networks.
In particular,Gao et al.
(2013) focused on temporal effects in terms of temporal preferences and temporal correlations,and modeled temporal cyclic patterns to capture a user?s mobile behavior to investigate correlations tothe spatial context and social context in location-based social networks.Social tie is the most basic unit to form the network structure.
Tang et al.
(2011) proposed a semi-supervised framework, the partially labeled factor graph model to infer the type of social relationships.The task was formulated as a relationship mining problem to detect the relationship semantics in real-world networks.
Tang et al.
(2012) further incorporated social theories and leveraged features basedon those social theories to infer social ties across heterogeneous networks via a transfer learning frame-work.
As can be seen, predicting social actions and inferring social ties were modeled as separate andindependent tasks in the above-mentioned approaches, deep interactions and mutual influence betweenthem were not taken into consideration.
In social media users interact with one another to share the con-tent they both create and consume.
According to the homophily phenomenon, exploring bi-directionalinformation and mutual influence between them is intuitively appealing.We are also aware of several research work attempting to explore joint models to capture mutualbenefits and deep dependencies between different tasks in NLP, data mining and information extractionresearch communities ( (Ko et al., 2007), (Yu and Lam, 2008), (Yu et al., 2009), (Liu et al., 2009),(Yu and Lam, 2010b), (Yu and Lam, 2010a), (Yu et al., 2011), (Yu and Lam, 2012), (Zeng et al.,2013)).
In general, joint models aim to handle multiple hypotheses and uncertainty information and topredict many variables simultaneously such that subtasks can aid each other to boost the performance.849Ko et al.
(2007) proposed a joint answer ranking framework based on probabilistic graphical modelsfor question answering.
Yu and Lam (2008) proposed an integrated probabilistic and logic approachbased on Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) (Richardson and Domingos, 2006) to encyclopedia relationextraction.
However, this modeling only captures single relation extraction task.
Liu et al.
(2009)developed a Bayesian hierarchical approach, the topic-link LDA, to perform topic modeling and authorcommunity discovery for large-scale linked documents in one unified framework.
Yu et al.
(2009)integrated two sub-models in a unified framework via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplingbased inference algorithms.
This is a loosely coupled model since parameter estimation is performedseparately for the two sub-models.
Yu and Lam (2012) further proposed a joint model incorporatingprobabilistic graphical models and first-order logic for information extraction.
This joint model exploitsstructured variational approximation for tractable parameter learning.
Zeng et al.
(2013) presented asemi-supervised graph-based approach to joint Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging.
However,none of these models has been investigated or applied to social media and social network analysis.
Webelieve that one major reason could be the problem of high computational complexity, such as Yu et al.
(2009) and Yu and Lam (2012).
Since many social network sites contain millions of users, exploitingsuch models could be very challenging.
Currently, research on building joint approaches is still in theinfancy stage.
To the best of our knowledge, there is few systematically study on building joint modelsto explore mutual influence for social actions and social ties.3 ModelIn this section we consider both social action prediction and social tie inference in the context of socialmedia, where evidences for both actions and ties are available.
We begin by necessary description ofpreliminaries and notations, we then present the mutual latent random graphs (MLRGs) model, uponwhich both sources of evidence could be exploited simultaneously to capture their mutual influence.
Wealso discuss the major difference and superiority of this model against several alternative models.3.1 Preliminaries and NotationsLet G = (V,E) be a social network graph, where V = {v1, v2, .
.
.
, vN} is the set of |V| = Nusers and E = {e11, e12, .
.

V ?
V is the set of |E| = M connections between users.Let y = {y1, y2, .

, sM}(sij?
S) be the set of corresponding social tie labels associated with M connec-tions.
The connection eij(1 ?

N, i ?= j) between viand vjmight be directed or undirected.
Tobe consistent, both sij?= sjiand sij= sjiare valid settings.
Given the observed social network data Dconstructing the graph G, our goal is to simultaneously detect the most likely types of actions y?and tiess?such that both of them are optimized.The exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) ( (Frank and Strauss, 1986), (Wasserman andPattison, 1996)) take the form of an exponential family as Pyi|G=?yi?Y?
(yi) =exp{?yi?Y??(yi)}?
?forthe social action yiin the social network graph G, where ?(?)
is a factor, ?
is a vector of parameters, ?(?
)is a p-vector of sufficient statistics, which captures network features of interest, its postulated dependencestructure, or both.
Lastly, ?
?is a normalization function to make all probabilities sum to one.
The classof ERGMs is a popular framework for social network modeling to capture global network characteristics.3.2 Modeling Social ActionsTo characterize the user action yi, we assume that for the user vithere exist observable attributes orproperties mi, such as the user?s registered information and historical actions.
Without loss of generality,we further assume that there exist some hidden, or latent properties xijfor vi.
These properties areimplicit and cannot be observed directly, such as the influence from social ties.
Consequently, we denotethe observable factor ?
(yi, vi,mi) for observable properties and latent factor ?h(yi, sij, xij) for hiddenproperties, respectively.
Given the graph G, the probability distribution of yidepends on both observableand latent factors as:Pyi|G?
?
(yi, vi,mi), Pyi|G?
?h(yi, sij, xij), Pyi|G?
?
(yi, vi,mi)?h(yi, sij, xij).

(sij, vi, vj,wij)This modeling integrates two types of factors for both observable and latent properties.
It captures notonly the user-behavior dependencies, but also the influence from social ties, for exploring social actions.3.3 Modeling Social TiesTo characterize the social tie sijbetween user pair (vi, vj), we also assume that there exist observableproperties wij, such as the posterior probability of the social tie sijassigned to (vi, vj).
We denote theobservable factor ??
(sij, vi, vj,wij) for wij.
Similarly, we further assume that there exist some latentproperties to incorporate the social action influence on social ties.
To be consistent, we still use thevector xijto represent the latent properties and the latent factor ?h(yi, sij, xij) to capture the socialaction influence on social ties.
Note that both xijand ?h(yi, sij, xij) now play double duties in encodingsocial action dependency and social tie connection simultaneously.
On the one hand, ?h(yi, sij, xij)exploits influence from social ties for modeling social actions.
On the other hand, this factor exploitsinfluence from social actions for modeling social ties.
By doing so, the latent factor ?h(yi, sij, xij) is bi-directionally coupled, encoding both sources of evidence and exploring mutual influence and dynamicsbetween social actions and social ties.
Such mutual influence and dynamics are crucial and modelingthem often leads to improved performance.
Given the user action yiand the graph G, we devise thefollowing model for the probability distribution of sijdepending on both observable and latent factorsas:Psij|(yi,G)?
??
(sij, vi, vj,wij), Psij|(yi,G)?
?h(yi, sij, xij), Psij|(yi,G)?
??
(sij, vi, vj,wij)?h(yi, sij, xij).
(2)3.4 Modeling Mutual InfluenceThe mutual correlation between social actions and social ties advocates joint modeling of both sourcesof evidence in a single unified framework.
Based on the above descriptions, we define our mutual la-tent random graph (MLRG) based on exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) ( (Frank andStrauss, 1986), (Wasserman and Pattison, 1996)), which have gained tremendous successes in socialnetwork analysis and have even become the current state-of-the-art (Robins et al., 2007).
To designa concrete model, one needs to specify distributions for the dependencies for MLRGs.
According tothe celebrated Hammersley-Clifford theory, the joint conditional distribution P(yi,sij)|Gis factorized as aproduct of potential functions over all cliques in the graph G and we summarize the MLRG in the abovetable.
In summary, our model consists of three factors: the factor ?
(yi, vi,mi) measuring dependencies851of the social action yiconditioned on G, the factor ??
(sij, vi, vj,wij) measuring the social tie sijbe-tween two arbitrary users viand vjin G, and the latent factor ?h(yi, sij, xij) exploiting mutual influencebetween the social action yiand social tie sij.The three factors ?(?
), ?h(?
), and ??(?)
can be instantiated in different ways.
In this paper, each factoris defined as the exponential family of an inner product over sufficient statistics (feature functions) andcorresponding parameters.
Each factor is a clique template whose parameters are tied.
More specifically,we define these factors as?
(yi, vi,mi) =1Z?exp{?yi?Y?f(yi, vi,mi)}, ?h(yi, sij, xij) =1Z?exp{?yi?Y,sij?S?g(yi, sij, xij)},??
(sij, vi, vj,wij) =1Z?exp{?sij?S?h(sij, vi, vj,wij)}, (3)where ?, ?, and ?
are real-valued weighting vectors and f(?
), g(?
), and h(?)
are corresponding vectors offeature functions.We denote ?
= {?, ?, ?}
as the set of model?s parameters, and concatenate all factor functions as?q(yi, sij) = ?f(yi, vi,mi) + ?g(yi, sij, xij) + ?h(sij, vi, vj,wij), the joint probability distributionshown in the above table can be rewritten asP(y,s)|G=?yi?Y,sij?S?
(yi, sij) =1Zexp{?yi?Y,sij?S?q(yi, sij)}, (4)where Z = Z?Z?Z?is the partition function of our MLRG model.Figure 1 shows an example social network (V = {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6}, Y = {active, idle}, S ={friend, colleague, family}) and the corresponding 3D graphical representation of the MLRG model.The functions f(?)
model dependencies of social actions in the bottom part, and the functions h(?)
modeldependencies of social ties in the upper part.
More importantly, the functions g(?)
capture mutual in-fluence and dependencies between social actions and social ties.
As we will see, this modeling offers anatural formalism for exploiting bi-directional dependencies and interactions between social actions andsocial ties to capture their mutual influence, as well as a great flexibility to incorporate a large collectionof arbitrary, overlapping and nonindependent features.3.5 DiscussionNoticeably, our proposed MLRG model is essentially different from the standard exponential-familyrandom graph models (ERGMs) and the prior models discussed in Section 2 mainly in two aspects.Firstly, compared to the standard ERGMs, the MLRG model defines latent factors to assume mutual anddynamical interaction between social ties and social actions.
Secondly, compared to the prior modelssuch as (Ma et al., 2009) and (Tang et al., 2011), MLRG provides a single unified framework to addressboth social action prediction and social tie inference simultaneously while enjoying the benefits of bothsources of evidence.Importantly, we give an analytical explanation on the mutual nature of our model in terms of a randomwalk (Lov?asz, 1996) perspective.
A random walk on the graph G is a reversible Markov chain on thevertexes V. The social influence propagation procedure occurs through information diffusion in thesocial graph G. More specifically, a user viwill propagate his/her influence to other related users, andwill propagate more to the user which has a stronger relation (e.g., friendship) with vi.
The influencepropagation will stop when the social graph reaches an equilibrium state, in which both social actionsand social ties are mutually reinforced.
Interestingly, this process is consistent with the homophilyphenomenon that a user in the social network tends to be similar to his/her connected neighbors.4 Learning and Inference4.1 Mutual OptimizationThe goal of learning MLRG model is to estimate a parameter configuration ?
= {?, ?, ?}
such that thelog-likelihood of observation is maximized.
We define the log-likelihood objective function O(?)

?(?)
=?yi?Y?22?2+?yi?Y,sij?S?22?2+?sij?S?22?2.We propose a mutual gradient descent (MGD) algorithm based on the stochastic gradient descent(SGD) ( (Lecun et al., 1998), (Bottou, 2004)) framework, for estimating the parameters efficiently ina mutual and collaborative manner.
Once we have optimized the social action parameters ?
and ?, theinfluence and hypotheses of social action can aid the learning of the social tie parameters ?
and ?, andvice versa.
As shown in Algorithm 1, ?
is coupled parameter vector for both actions and ties, and isupdated twice in each iteration of MGD.
By doing so, MGD not only allows learning of social actionparameters to capture social tie influence, but it also optimizes social tie parameters to alleviate socialaction influence.
This training procedure runs iteratively until converge to boost both the optimization ofsocial actions and social ties.Each iteration of the MGD algorithm consists of drawing an example at random and applying param-eter updates by moving in the direction defined by the stochastically approximated gradient of the lossfunction (e.g.,?O???).
We update each parameter with a learning rate ?.
Ideally, each parameter shouldhave its own learning rate.
If shared parameter weights are used, the best learning rate of a weight shouldbe inversely proportional to the square root of the number of connection sharing that weight (Bottou,2004).
In our MGD implementation, for simplicity we use the same learning rate for all the parameters.We select a small subset of training data and try various learning rates on the subset, then pick the onethat most reduces the loss and use it on the full dataset.
We summarize the partial derivatives of thelog-likelihood function O with respect to the parameter vectors ?, ?
and ?
as follows:?O?

(8)It is worth noting that the MGD algorithm computes approximations of the gradients, due to theintractability of the normalizing constant Z in the log-likelihood of our MLRG model.
Our proposed853MGD algorithm is a generalized extension and it distinguishes from the standard SGD algorithm in twoaspects: (1) MGD optimizes three types of parameters simultaneously, thus MGD is much more generalthan SGD, and it is more scalable and applicable to real-world problems.
(2) MGD performs mutualand collaborative optimization to enable mutual influence between social actions and social ties, whereasSGD does not take such influence into account.4.2 Complexity AnalysisGiven several conditions including a suitable choice of the learning rate and a convex or pseudo-convexobjective function, the MGD algorithm converges almost surely to a global optimum, otherwise it con-verges almost surely to a local optimum.
In our experiments, this algorithm has good performance evenif it does not reach the global optimum.
Let D be the number of samples in the social graph G, n bethe number of iterations, and p be the average number of non-zero attributes (features) per sample, thecomputational complexity of our MGD algorithm takes O(nDp).
As can be seen, this algorithm is com-putationally efficient, and convergence is very fast when the training examples are redundant since onlya few examples are needed to sample.
Furthermore, this algorithm is online and scale sub-linearly withthe amount of training data, making it very attractive for large-scale datasets.4.3 InferenceThe objective of inference is to find the most likely types of actions y?and corresponding social tie labelss?, that is, to find (y?, s?)
= argmax(y,s)P(y,s|G).
The inference procedure is straightforward.
Based onthe learned parameters ?
?= {?
?, ?
?, ??
}, we firstly predict the label of each social action yiby findinga labeling assignment that maximizes Pyi|Gas y?i= argmaxyi?YPyi|G.
We then infer the social tie labelsijsuch that s?ij= argmaxsij?SPsij|(yi,G).5 Experiments5.1 Foursquare DataWe crawled one dataset from Foursquare1, a popular location-based mobile social networking site formobile devices (e.g., smartphones) for our experimental evaluation.
Foursquare allows a user to checkin at a physical location via his cellphone, and then let his online friends know where he is by publishingsuch check-in action online.
Users check-in at venues using a mobile website, text messaging or a device-specific application by selecting from a list of venues the application locates nearby.
Location is basedon GPS hardware in the mobile device or network location provided by the application, and the map isbased on data from the OpenStreetMap project.
Each check-in awards the user points and sometimesbadges.
Figure 2 illustrates a snapshot of the Foursquare application interface on smartphones.To alleviate the data sparsity problem for better evaluation, we selected check-in venues which havebeen visited by at least two distinct users, and users who have checked in at least 10 distinct venues.The resulting dataset contains 12,368 distinct users, 186,745 venues, 1,425,664 check-in behaviors and56,395 social connections from January 2012 to December 2012.
Table 1 lists the more detailed statisticalinformation on our dataset, where the ?Avg.
Num.

is the average number of check-ins peruser, and ?Max.
Num.
of Check-ins?
is the maximal number of check-ins among users (similarly for?Avg.

The ?Average Clustering Coefficient(ACC)?
is a measure of the degree to which users in the Foursquare network tend to cluster together,and ?Diameter?
is the longest shortest path in the network.
All user and venue information has beenanonymized.
Each check-in has a unique id as well as the user id and the venue id, and each socialconnection consists of two users represented by two unique ids.5.2 TaskMobile phones have become an important tool for communication and they are an ideal platform forunderstanding social influence and social dynamics.
Using our Foursquare dataset, we can investigatethe mutual influence between social actions and social ties.
More specifically, we can investigate how1https://foursquare.com/854Figure 2: A snapshot of the Foursquare application interface on smartphones.Duration Jan 2012 to Dec 2012 Num.

Figure 3 gives an illustrative example of social action prediction and social tie discoverytasks in our Foursquare dataset.
Given an unseen Foursquare social network dataset, our objective is topredict whether the users have check-in behaviors and whether there are friendship relations betweenthese users.
In the right figure, we list the predicted check-in behaviors (in red color) and the inferredfriendship relations between users (in green color).
The probabilities associated with the predictionsrepresent corresponding confidence scores.5.3 Evaluation MethodologyWe exploited a wide range of important features to define the factors ?(?
), and ??(?
), including temporaland social features such as the number of check-ins and number of new check-ins in a user?s history,number of friends of a user, the check-in information from a user?s friends, etc.
For the coupled latentfactor ?h(?
), we incorporated social tie evidences and hypotheses as features to capture social actions,and we also incorporated social action evidences and hypotheses as features to leverage social ties.For quantitative performance evaluation, we used the standard measures of Precision (P), Recall (R),and F-measure (the harmonic mean of P and R:2PRP+R) for both social action prediction and social tieinference.
We performed four-fold cross-validation on this dataset, and took the average performance.We compared our approach with the following alternative methods for predicting social actions andinferring social ties:?SVM: This model views social action prediction and social tie inference as two separate classificationproblems, and solves them independently.
We used the SVM-light2package for this model.
?ERGM: This is the traditional exponential-family random graph model without the latent factor ?h(?

Similar to SVM, this model alsoperforms them separately.
?DCRF: This model is a dynamical and factorial CRF (Sutton et al., 2007) used to jointly solve the twotasks.

These resultsnot only imply that there exists high correlation and mutual influence between social actions and socialties, but also demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our model for exploring them.The SVM model solves social action prediction and social tie inference independently without consid-ering mutual influence and benefits between them, thus leading to the worst performance.
The ERGMoutperforms SVM by capturing social network structures.
However, the performance of this model isstill limited and there is a large room for improving.
The DCRF model easily outperforms both SVMand ERGM by modeling social actions and social ties jointly in a single framework.
However, com-pared to our MLRG model, there are still some shortcomings of DCRF.
DCRF was proposed to labeland segment sequence data, such as POS tagging and NP chunking (Sutton et al., 2007).
The graphicalstructure of DCRF is not well suited for social networks to capture mutual influence.
The merits of ourproposed MLRG model over other models principally come from (1) appropriate graphical structure forsocial network modeling, especially the coupled latent factor to exploit mutual influence simultaneously,and (2) the mutual and collaborative learning algorithm MGD to reinforce the optimization of both socialactions and social ties.5.5 Effect of Mutual Influence and AnalysisWe also examined the nature and effectiveness of the associated latent factors on the mutual influence,and Figure 4 demonstrates their feasibility in our modeling.
Note that if we do not incorporate thelatent factors, our MLRG model becomes the traditional ERGM baseline approach.
It shows that the856latent factors consistently enhance Precision, Recall, and F-measure for both social action prediction andsocial tie inference tasks.
For example, the latent factors significantly improve the F-measure by 8.27%(from 80.19 to 88.46) for social action prediction, and improve the F-measure by 6.0% (from 78.11 to84.11) for social tie discovery, respectively.
These results not only illustrate that social actions and socialties influence each other to a large extent, but also demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of ourlatent factors for exploring them.We performed an in-depth error analysis to provide gains of our MLRGmodel and some insights on theinfluence between users?
check-in behaviors and users?
friendship relations.
By carefully investigatingour Foursquare dataset, we found that approximately 75% users tend to cluster together to create tightlyknit groups characterized by a relatively high density of friendship relations or ties, and the remaining25% users loosely or seldom connect with each other through the friendship relations.
In other words,75% users form high density of relationship ties and the average clustering coefficient (ACC) is high(0.61).
However, the tie density of the remaining 25% users is much lower, since the ACC of theseusers is only 0.18.
Compared to the baseline methods (especially the SVM and ERGM methods), theperformance improvement of our MLRG model mainly comes from 75% users with high density offriendship ties.
In particular, about 20% prediction errors (including social action and social tie predictionerrors) of such users made by the SVM model can be corrected by our MLRG model.
This finding showsthat, the mutual influence between users?
check-in behaviors and users?
friendship relations increaseswith the density growth of the friendship relations of these users.
This finding is intuitively correct and isconsistent with the homophily theory.
More interestingly, this finding also implies the gains and merits ofour MLRG model for exploiting mutual influence, especially when the users in the Foursquare networkcluster together tightly with high density of ties.5.6 EfficiencyA number of learning algorithms can be applied for parameter optimization of our MLRG model.
Table4 summarizes the efficiency of several alternative optimization algorithms for learning our model?s pa-rameters.
We compared the learning time (hr.)
and inference time (sec.)
of the MGD algorithm to loopybelief propagation (LBP), Markov chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman,1984), and variational mean-field (VMF) approximation algorithms (Wainwright and Jordan, 2008).Both Sutton et al.
(2007) and Tang et al.
(2011) used LBP for parameter estimation.
LBP is inherentlyunstable and may cause convergence problems.
When the graph has large tree-width as in our case, theLBP algorithm is inefficient, and is slow to converge.
In Gibbs sampling, the candidate sample is alwaysaccepted with the probability of 1, lacking the capability of measuring quality of samples and elimi-nating low grade samples.
The VMF approach aims to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergencebetween an approximated distribution Q and the target distribution P by finding the best distribution Qfrom some family of distributions for which an inference is feasible.
The MGD algorithm we proposedis very efficient.
It is particularly notable that our MGD algorithm takes much less time than other threealgorithms for learning.
In particular, our proposed algorithm is over orders of magnitude faster than theLBP for running.6 Conclusions and Future WorkFinally, we answer the questions in Section 1 to draw the conclusions of this paper as follows:Is there any dynamics or mutual influence between social actions and social ties?
Doubtlessly, so-cial actions and social ties are highly correlated and mutually reinforced.
We propose a single unifiedframework, mutual latent random graph (MLRG), to exploit homophily for simultaneous social actionprediction and social tie discovery.
The MLRG model incorporates coupled latent factors to capturedynamics and mutual influence between social actions and social ties.
Moreover, we propose the mu-tual gradient descent (MGD) algorithm to perform mutual and collaborative optimization to reinforceboth social actions and social ties.
By coupling actions with ties jointly in a single coherent framework,MLRG achieves significantly better performance on both social action prediction and social tie inferenceon our collected Foursquare dataset, compared to several state-of-the-art existing models.857To what extent do they influence each other?
We perform an in-depth analysis to show the gains andmerits of our MLRG model, as well as some insights on the influence between users?
check-in behaviorsand users?
friendship relations.
The finding on our real-world Foursquare data demonstrates that socialactions (users?
check-in behaviors) and social ties (users?
friendship relations) influence each other to aconsiderable degree when the users connect each other tightly with high density of ties in the network.Experimental results also illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our latent factors for exploringthe mutual influence.
In particular, the latent factors in our model significantly improve the F-measureby 8.27% (from 80.19 to 88.46) for social action prediction, and improve the F-measure by 6.0% (from78.11 to 84.11) for social tie discovery, respectively.Two directions of future work appear attractive: Inferring fine-grained and multiple relationships be-tween users (such as friendship, family, colleague, and advisor-adviser, etc.)
on complex social networksand extending our established optimization algorithms for parallel and distributed learning based on theHadoop MapReduce framework to handle large scale social networks involving billions of users.Figure 4: Contribution of latent factors on social action predic-tion (left) and social tie inference (right).Algorithms Learning InferenceLBP 8.67 8MCMC 3.45 124VMF 2.39 7MGD 0.45 6Table 4: Efficiency comparison of differ-ent optimization algorithms on learningtime (hr.)
