?fanmiao.cslt.thu@gmail.comAbstractThe essence of distantly supervised rela-tion extraction is that it is an incompletemulti-label classification problem with s-parse and noisy features.
To tackle the s-parsity and noise challenges, we proposesolving the classification problem usingmatrix completion on factorized matrix ofminimized rank.
We formulate relationclassification as completing the unknownlabels of testing items (entity pairs) in a s-parse matrix that concatenates training andtesting textual features with training label-s. Our algorithmic framework is based onthe assumption that the rank of item-by-feature and item-by-label joint matrix islow.
We apply two optimization model-s to recover the underlying low-rank ma-trix leveraging the sparsity of feature-labelmatrix.
The matrix completion problem isthen solved by the fixed point continuation(FPC) algorithm, which can find the glob-al optimum.
Experiments on two wide-ly used datasets with different dimension-s of textual features demonstrate that ourlow-rank matrix completion approach sig-nificantly outperforms the baseline and thestate-of-the-art methods.1 IntroductionRelation Extraction (RE) is the process of gen-erating structured relation knowledge from un-structured natural language texts.
Traditional su-pervised methods (Zhou et al, 2005; Bach andBadaskar, 2007) on small hand-labeled corpora,such as MUC1and ACE2, can achieve high pre-cision and recall.
However, as producing hand-labeled corpora is laborius and expensive, the su-pervised approach can not satisfy the increasing1http://www.itl.nist.gov/iaui/894.02/related projects/muc/2http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/ace/Figure 1: Training corpus generated by the basicalignment assumption of distantly supervised re-lation extraction.
The relation instances are thetriples related to President Barack Obama in theFreebase, and the relation mentions are some sen-tences describing him in the Wikipedia.demand of building large-scale knowledge reposi-tories with the explosion of Web texts.
To addressthe lacking training data issue, we consider the dis-tant (Mintz et al, 2009) or weak (Hoffmann et al,2011) supervision paradigm attractive, and we im-prove the effectiveness of the paradigm in this pa-per.The intuition of the paradigm is that onecan take advantage of several knowledge bases,such as WordNet3, Freebase4and YAGO5, toautomatically label free texts, like Wikipedia6and New York Times corpora7, based on someheuristic alignment assumptions.
An exampleaccounting for the basic but practical assumptionis illustrated in Figure 1, in which we knowthat the two entities (<Barack Obama,U.S.>) are not only involved in the rela-tion instances8coming from knowledge bases(President-of(Barack Obama, U.S.)and Born-in(Barack Obama, U.S.)),3http://wordnet.princeton.edu4http://www.freebase.com5http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/yago6http://www.wikipedia.org7http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T198According to convention, we regard a structured tripler(ei, ej) as a relation instance which is composed of a pair ofentities <ei, ej>and a relation name r with respect to them.839Error MatrixCompleted Low?rank Matrix?Observed Sparse MatrixTrainingItemsTestingItemsIncomplete LabelsNoisy FeaturesFigure 2: The procedure of noise-tolerant low-rank matrix completion.
In this scenario, distantly super-vised relation extraction task is transformed into completing the labels for testing items (entity pairs) ina sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels.
We seek torecover the underlying low-rank matrix and to complete the unknown testing labels simultaneously.but also co-occur in several relation mentions9appearing in free texts (Barack Obama isthe 44th and current President ofthe U.S. and Barack Obama was bornin Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S., etc.).
Weextract diverse textual features from all thoserelation mentions and combine them into a richfeature vector labeled by the relation names(President-of and Born-in) to produce aweak training corpus for relation classification.This paradigm is promising to generate large-scale training corpora automatically.
However, itcomes up against three technical challeges:?
Sparse features.
As we cannot tell whatkinds of features are effective in advance, wehave to use NLP toolkits, such as StanfordCoreNLP10, to extract a variety of textual fea-tures, e.g., named entity tags, part-of-speechtags and lexicalized dependency paths.
Un-fortunately, most of them appear only once inthe training corpus, and hence leading to verysparse features.?
Noisy features.
Not all relation mentionsexpress the corresponding relation instances.For example, the second relation mention inFigure 1 does not explicitly describe any rela-tion instance, so features extracted from thissentence can be noisy.
Such analogous casescommonly exist in feature extraction.?
Incomplete labels.
Similar to noisy fea-9The sentences that contain the given entity pair are calledrelation mentions.10http://nlp.stanford.edu/downloads/corenlp.shtmltures, the generated labels can be in-complete.
For example, the fourth re-lation mention in Figure 1 should havebeen labeled by the relation Senate-of.However, the incomplete knowledge basedoes not contain the corresponding relationinstance (Senate-of(Barack Obama,U.S.)).
Therefore, the distant supervisionparadigm may generate incomplete labelingcorpora.In essence, distantly supervised relation extrac-tion is an incomplete multi-label classification taskwith sparse and noisy features.In this paper, we formulate the relation-extraction task from a novel perspective of usingmatrix completion with low rank criterion.
To thebest of our knowledge, we are the first to apply thistechnique on relation extraction with distant super-vision.
More specifically, as shown in Figure 2, wemodel the task with a sparse matrix whose rowspresent items (entity pairs) and columns containnoisy textual features and incomplete relation la-bels.
In such a way, relation classification is trans-formed into a problem of completing the unknownlabels for testing items in the sparse matrix thatconcatenates training and testing textual featureswith training labels, based on the assumption thatthe item-by-feature and item-by-label joint matrixis of low rank.
The rationale of this assumptionis that noisy features and incomplete labels aresemantically correlated.
The low-rank factoriza-tion of the sparse feature-label matrix delivers thelow-dimensional representation of de-correlationfor features and labels.840We contribute two optimization models, DRM-C11-b and DRMC-1, aiming at exploiting the s-parsity to recover the underlying low-rank matrixand to complete the unknown testing labels simul-taneously.
Moreover, the logistic cost function isintegrated in our models to reduce the influence ofnoisy features and incomplete labels, due to thatit is suitable for binary variables.
We also modifythe fixed point continuation (FPC) algorithm (Maet al, 2011) to find the global optimum.Experiments on two widely used datasetsdemonstrate that our noise-tolerant approachesoutperform the baseline and the state-of-the-artmethods.
Furthermore, we discuss the influence offeature sparsity, and our approaches consistentlyachieve better performance than compared meth-ods under different sparsity degrees.2 Related WorkThe idea of distant supervision was firstly pro-posed in the field of bioinformatics (Craven andKumlien, 1999).
Snow et al (2004) used Word-Net as the knowledge base to discover more h-pyernym/hyponym relations between entities fromnews articles.
However, either bioinformaticdatabase or WordNet is maintained by a few ex-perts, thus hardly kept up-to-date.As we are stepping into the big data era, theexplosion of unstructured Web texts simulates usto build more powerful models that can automat-ically extract relation instances from large-scaleonline natural language corpora without hand-labeled annotation.
Mintz et al (2009) adopt-ed Freebase (Bollacker et al, 2008; Bollackeret al, 2007), a large-scale crowdsourcing knowl-edge base online which contains billions of rela-tion instances and thousands of relation names, todistantly supervise Wikipedia corpus.
The basicalignment assumption of this work is that if a pairof entities participate in a relation, all sentencesthat mention these entities are labeled by that rela-tion name.
Then we can extract a variety of textu-al features and learn a multi-class logistic regres-sion classifier.
Inspired by multi-instance learn-ing (Maron and Lozano-P?erez, 1998), Riedel et al(2010) relaxed the strong assumption and replacedall sentences with at least one sentence.
Hoff-mann et al (2011) pointed out that many entitypairs have more than one relation.
They extend-11It is the abbreviation for Distant supervision for Relationextraction with Matrix Completioned the multi-instance learning framework (Riedelet al, 2010) to the multi-label circumstance.
Sur-deanu et al (2012) proposed a novel approach tomulti-instance multi-label learning for relation ex-traction, which jointly modeled all the sentences intexts and all labels in knowledge bases for a giv-en entity pair.
Other literatures (Takamatsu et al,2012; Min et al, 2013; Zhang et al, 2013; Xuet al, 2013) addressed more specific issues, likehow to construct the negative class in learning orhow to adopt more information, such as name en-tity tags, to improve the performance.Our work is more relevant to Riedel et al?s(2013) which considered the task as a matrix fac-torization problem.
Their approach is composedof several models, such as PCA (Collins et al,2001) and collaborative filtering (Koren, 2008).However, they did not concern about the data noisebrought by the basic assumption of distant super-vision.3 ModelWe apply a new technique in the field of ap-plied mathematics, i.e., low-rank matrix comple-tion with convex optimization.
The breakthroughwork on this topic was made by Cand`es and Recht(2009) who proved that most low-rank matricescan be perfectly recovered from an incompleteset of entries.
This promising theory has beensuccessfully applied on many active research ar-eas, such as computer vision (Cabral et al, 2011),recommender system (Rennie and Srebro, 2005)and system controlling (Fazel et al, 2001).
Ourmodels for relation extraction are based on thetheoretic framework proposed by Goldberg et al(2010), which formulated the multi-label trans-ductive learning as a matrix completion problem.The new framework for classification enhances therobustness to data noise by penalizing differen-t cost functions for features and labels.3.1 FormulationSuppose that we have built a training corpus forrelation classification with n items (entity pairs),d-dimensional textual features, and t labels (rela-tions), based on the basic alignment assumptionproposed by Mintz et al (2009).
Let Xtrain?Rn?dand Ytrain?
Rn?tdenote the feature matrixand the label matrix for training, respectively.
Thelinear classifier we adopt aims to explicitly learnthe weight matrix W ?

Then we canpredict the label matrix Ytest?
Rm?tof m testingitems with respect to the feature matrix Xtest?Rm?d.
LetZ =[XtrainYtrainXtestYtest].This linear classification problem can be trans-formed into completing the unobservable entriesin Ytestby means of the observable entries inXtrain, Ytrainand Xtest, based on the assumptionthat the rank of matrix Z ?
R(n+m)?
(d+t)is low.The model can be written as,arg minZ?R(n+m)?(d+t)rank(Z)s.t.

We thus defineZ = Z?+ E,where Z?as the underlying low-rank matrixZ?=[X?Y?
]=[X?trainY?trainX?testY?test],and E is the error matrixE =[EXtrainEYtrainEXtest0].The rank function in Formula (2) is a non-convexfunction that is difficult to be optimized.
The sur-rogate of the function can be the convex nucle-ar norm ||Z||?=?
?k(Z) (Cand`es and Recht,2009), where ?kis the k-th largest singular val-ue of Z.
To tolerate the noise entries in the errormatrix E, we minimize the cost functions CxandCyfor features and labels respectively, rather thanusing the hard constraints in Formula (2).According to Formula (1), Z??
R(n+m)?
(d+t)can be represented as [X?,WX?]
instead of[X?, Y?
], by explicitly modeling the bias vectorb.
Therefore, this convex optimization model iscalled DRMC-b,arg minZ,b?||Z||?+1|?X|?(i,j)?
?XCx(zij, xij)+?|?Y|?(i,j)?
?YCy(zi(j+d)+ bj, yij),(3)where ?
and ?
are the positive trade-off weights.More specifically, we minimize the nuclear norm||Z||?via employing the regularization terms, i.e.,the cost functions Cxand Cyfor features and la-bels.If we implicitly model the bias vector b,Z??
R(n+m)?
(1+d+t)can be denoted by[1, X?,W?X?]
instead of [X?, Y?
], in which W?takes the role of [bT; W] in DRMC-b.
Then wederive another optimization model called DRMC-1,arg minZ?||Z||?+1|?X|?(i,j)?

?YCy(zi(j+d+1), yij)s.t.
Z(:, 1) = 1,(4)where Z(:, 1) denotes the first column of Z.For our relation classification task, both featuresand labels are binary.
We assume that the actualentry u belonging to the underlying matrix Z?israndomly generated via a sigmoid function (Jor-dan, 1995): Pr(u|v) = 1/(1 + e?uv), given theobserved binary entry v from the observed sparsematrix Z.
Then, we can apply the log-likelihoodcost function to measure the conditional probabil-ity and derive the logistic cost function for CxandCy,C(u, v) = ?
logPr(u|v) = log(1 + e?uv),After completing the entries in Ytest, we adop-t the sigmoid function to calculate the conditionalprobability of relation rj, given entity pair piper-taining to yijin Ytest,Pr(rj|pi) =11 + e?yij, yij?
Ytest.Finally, we can achieve Top-N predicted relationinstances via ranking the values of Pr(rj|pi).8424 AlgorithmThe matrix rank minimization problem is NP-hard.
Therefore, Cand?es and Recht (2009) sug-gested to use a convex relaxation, the nuclear nor-m minimization instead.
Then, Ma et al (2011)proposed the fixed point continuation (FPC) algo-rithm which is fast and robust.
Moreover, Gold-frab and Ma (2011) proved the convergence of theFPC algorithm for solving the nuclear norm mini-mization problem.
We thus adopt and modify thealgorithm aiming to find the optima for our noise-tolerant models, i.e., Formulae (3) and (4).4.1 Fixed point continuation for DRMC-bAlgorithm 1 describes the modified FPC algorithmfor solving DRMC-b, which contains two steps foreach iteration,Gradient step: In this step, we infer the ma-trix gradient g(Z) and bias vector gradient g(b) asfollows,g(zij) =??????

The values in brackets pertaining toDRMC-b and DRMC-1 are the exact optimal ranks that we choose for the completed matrices on testingsets.5 ExperimentsIn order to conduct reliable experiments, we adjustand estimate the parameters for our approaches,DRMC-b and DRMC-1, and compare them withother four kinds of landmark methods (Mintz etal., 2009; Hoffmann et al, 2011; Surdeanu et al,2012; Riedel et al, 2013) on two public datasets.5.1 DatasetThe two widely used datasets that we adopt areboth automatically generated by aligning Freebaseto New York Times corpora.
The first dataset12,NYT?10, was developed by Riedel et al (2010),and also used by Hoffmann et al (2011) and Sur-deanu et al (2012).
Three kinds of features, name-ly, lexical, syntactic and named entity tag fea-tures, were extracted from relation mentions.
Thesecond dataset13, NYT?13, was also released byRiedel et al (2013), in which they only regardedthe lexicalized dependency path between two enti-ties as features.
Table 1 shows that the two datasetsdiffer in some main attributes.
More specifically,NYT?10 contains much higher dimensional fea-tures than NYT?13, whereas fewer training andtesting items.5.2 Parameter settingIn this part, we address the issue of setting param-eters: the trade-off weights ?
and ?, the step sizes?zand ?b, and the decay parameter ?
?.We set ?
= 1 to make the contribution of thecost function terms for feature and label matricesequal in Formulae (3) and (4).
?
is assigned by aseries of values obeying ?k+1= max(?k?
?, ?F).12http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/riedel/ecml/13http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/riedel/data-univSchema/We follow the suggestion in (Goldberg et al,2010) that ?
starts at ?1?
?, and ?1is the largestsingular value of the matrix Z.
We set ?
?= 0.01.The final value of ?, namely ?F, is equal to 0.01.Ma et al (2011) revealed that as long as the non-negative step sizes satisfy ?z< min(4|?Y|?, |?X|)and ?b<4|?Y|?
(n+m), the FPC algorithm will guaran-tee to converge to a global optimum.
Therefore,we set ?z= ?b= 0.5 to satisfy the above con-straints on both two datasets.5.3 Rank estimationEven though the FPC algorithm converges in iter-ative fashion, the value of ?
varying with differentdatasets is difficult to be decided.
In practice, werecord the rank of matrix Z at each round of iter-ation until it converges at a rather small threshold?
= 10?4.
The reason is that we suppose the opti-mal low-rank representation of the matrix Z con-veys the truly effective information about underly-ing semantic correlation between the features andthe corresponding labels.We use the five-fold cross validation on the val-idation set and evaluate the performance on eachfold with different ranks.
At each round of itera-tion, we gain a recovered matrix and average theF114scores from Top-5 to Top-all predicted rela-tion instances to measure the performance.
Figure3 illustrates the curves of average F1 scores.
Afterrecording the rank associated with the highest F1score on each fold, we compute the mean and thestandard deviation to estimate the range of optimalrank for testing.

However, it sharply de-creases if we continue reducing the optimal rank.An intuitive explanation is that the high-rank ma-trix contains much noise and the model tends to beoverfitting, whereas the matrix of excessively lowrank is more likely to lose principal informationand the model tends to be underfitting.5.4 Method ComparisonFirstly, we conduct experiments to compare ourapproaches with Mintz-09 (Mintz et al, 2009),MultiR-11 (Hoffmann et al, 2011), MIML-12 andMIML-at-least-one-12 (Surdeanu et al, 2012) onNYT?10 dataset.
Surdeanu et al (2012) releasedthe open source code15to reproduce the experi-mental results on those previous methods.
More-over, their programs can control the feature spar-15http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/mimlre.shtmlsity degree through a threshold ?
which filters thefeatures that appears less than ?
times.
They set?
= 5 in the original code by default.
Therefore,we follow their settings and adopt the same wayto filter the features.
In this way, we guaranteethe fair comparison for all methods.
Figure 4 (a)shows that our approaches achieve the significantimprovement on performance.We also perform the experiments to compareour approaches with the state-of-the-art NFE-1316(Riedel et al, 2013) and its sub-methods (N-13,F-13 and NF-13) on NYT?13 dataset.
Figure 4 (b)illustrates that our approaches still outperform thestate-of-the-art methods.
In practical application-s, we also concern about the precision on Top-Npredicted relation instances.
Therefore, We com-pare the precision of Top-100s, Top-200s and Top-500s for DRMC-1, DRMC-b and the state-of-the-16Readers may refer to the website,http://www.riedelcastro.org/uschema for the details ofthose methods.

In this section, we discuss how our approachestackle these natural flaws.Due to the noisy features and incomplete label-s, the underlying low-rank data matrix with tru-ly effective information tends to be corrupted andthe rank of observed data matrix can be extremelyhigh.
Figure 5 demonstrates that the ranks of da-ta matrices are approximately 2,000 for the initialoptimization of DRMC-b and DRMC-1.
Howev-er, those high ranks result in poor performance.As the ranks decline before approaching the op-timum, the performance gradually improves, im-plying that our approaches filter the noise in dataand keep the principal information for classifica-tion via recovering the underlying low-rank datamatrix.Furthermore, we discuss the influence of thefeature sparsity for our approaches and the state-8460 100 200 300 400 5000.1220.1240.1260.1280.130.1320.1340.1360.1380.14RankAverage?F1Fold 1Fold 2Fold 3Fold 4Fold 50 100 200 300 400 5000.1240.1260.1280.130.1320.1340.1360.1380.14RankAverage?F1Fold 1Fold 2Fold 3Fold 4Fold 50 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.500.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91RecallPrecisionMintz?09MultiR?11MIML?12MIML?at?least?one?12DRMC?1(Rank=17)DRMC?b(Rank=43)0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91RecallPrecisionDRMC?1(Rank=2148)DRMC?b(Rank=2291)DRMC?1(Rank=1285)DRMC?b(Rank=1448)DRMC?1(Rank=404)DRMC?b(Rank=489)DRMC?1(Rank=17)DRMC?b(Rank=43)0 100 200 300 400 5000.1220.1240.1260.1280.130.1320.1340.1360.1380.14RankAverage?F1Fold 1Fold 2Fold 3Fold 4Fold 50 100 200 300 400 5000.1240.1260.1280.130.1320.1340.1360.1380.14RankAverage?F1Fold 1Fold 2Fold 3Fold 4Fold 50 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.500.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91RecallPrecisionMintz?09MultiR?11MIML?12MIML?at?least?one?12DRMC?1(Rank=17)DRMC?b(Rank=46)0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91RecallPrecisionDRMC?1(Rank=2539)DRMC?b(Rank=2730)DRMC?1(Rank=1447)DRMC?b(Rank=1644)DRMC?1(Rank=433)DRMC?b(Rank=531)DRMC?1(Rank=17)DRMC?b(Rank=46)0 100 200 300 400 5000.1240.1260.1280.130.1320.1340.1360.1380.14RankAverage?F1Fold 1Fold 2Fold 3Fold 4Fold 50 100 200 300 400 5000.1240.1260.1280.130.1320.1340.1360.1380.14RankAverage?F1Fold 1Fold 2Fold 3Fold 4Fold 50 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.500.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91RecallPrecisionMintz?09MultiR?11MIML?12MIML?at?least?one?12DRMC?1(Rank=16)DRMC?b(Rank=51)0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91RecallPrecisionDRMC?1(Rank=3186)DRMC?b(Rank=3444)DRMC?1(Rank=1728)DRMC?b(Rank=1991)DRMC?1(Rank=489)DRMC?b(Rank=602)DRMC?1(Rank=16)DRMC?b(Rank=51)Figure 6: Feature sparsity discussion on NYT?10 testing set.

They are, from left to right, five-fold cross validation forrank estimation on DRMC-b and DRMC-1, method comparison and precision-recall curve with differentranks, respectively.of-the-art methods.
We relax the feature filteringthreshold (?
= 4, 3, 2) in Surdeanu et al?s (2012)open source program to generate more sparse fea-tures from NYT?10 dataset.
Figure 6 shows thatour approaches consistently outperform the base-line and the state-of-the-art methods with diversefeature sparsity degrees.
Table 2 also lists therange of optimal rank for DRMC-b and DRMC-1 with different ?.
We observe that for each ap-proach, the optimal range is relatively stable.
Inother words, for each approach, the amount of tru-ly effective information about underlying seman-tic correlation keeps constant for the same dataset,which, to some extent, explains the reason why ourapproaches are robust to sparse features.7 Conclusion and Future WorkIn this paper, we contributed two noise-tolerantoptimization models17, DRMC-b and DRMC-1,for distantly supervised relation extraction taskfrom a novel perspective.
Our models are based onmatrix completion with low-rank criterion.
Exper-17The source code can be downloaded from https://github.com/nlpgeek/DRMC/tree/masteriments demonstrated that the low-rank represen-tation of the feature-label matrix can exploit theunderlying semantic correlated information for re-lation classification and is effective to overcomethe difficulties incurred by sparse and noisy fea-tures and incomplete labels, so that we achievedsignificant improvements on performance.Our proposed models also leave open question-s for distantly supervised relation extraction task.First, they can not process new coming testingitems efficiently, as we have to reconstruct the datamatrix containing not only the testing items but al-so all the training items for relation classification,and compute in iterative fashion again.
Second,the volume of the datasets we adopt are relativelysmall.
For the future work, we plan to improve ourmodels so that they will be capable of incrementallearning on large-scale datasets (Chang, 2011).AcknowledgmentsThis work is supported by National Program onKey Basic Research Project (973 Program) underGrant 2013CB329304, National Science Founda-tion of China (NSFC) under Grant No.61373075.847ReferencesNguyen Bach and Sameer Badaskar.
