IntroductionText adaptation is a teacher practice used to helpwith reading comprehension and Englishlanguage skills development for English languagelearners (ELLs) (Carlo, August, McLaughlin,Snow, Dressler, Lippman, Lively, & White,2004; Echevarria, Vogt and Short, 2004; Yano,Long and Ross, 1994).
The practice of textadaptation involves a teacher?s modification oftexts to make them more understandable, given astudent?s reading level.
Teacher adaptationsinclude text summaries, vocabulary support (e.g.,providing synonyms), and translation.
It is a time-consuming, but critical practice for K-12 teacherswho teach ELLs, since reading-level appropriatetexts are often hard to find.
To this end, we haveimplemented the Automated Text AdaptationTool v.1.0 (ATA v.1.0): an innovative,educational tool that automatically generates textadaptations similar to those teachers might create.We have also completed a teacher pilot study.Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005), and Heilman,Collins-Thompson, Callan, and Eskenazi (2006)describe related research addressing thedevelopment of NLP-based reading support tools.During our interactive demonstration,conference participants can (a) login to theInternet-accessible tool, (b) import text files, and(c) experiment with adaptation features.
We arecurrently interested in feedback from thecomputational linguistics community to informtool development related to (a) featureenhancement, and (b) ideas for new NLP-basedfeatures.
Until now, our primary source offeedback has been from teachers toward tooldevelopment from an educational perspective.2.
The Automated Text Adaptation ToolNLP-based text adaptation capabilities in the toolare described in this section (also see Figure 1.
)These adaptation features were selected forimplementation since they resemble teacher-based adaptation methods.2.1 English and Spanish Marginal NotesPedagogically, marginal notes are a kind of textsummary.
The Rhext automatic summarizationtool (Marcu, 2000) is used to produce marginalnotes in English.
The amount of marginal notesgenerated can be increased or decreased based onstudents?
needs.
Using Language Weaver?s1English-to-Spanish machine translation system,English marginal notes can be translated intoSpanish.2.2 Vocabulary SupportSynonyms for lower frequency (more difficult)words are output using a statistically-generatedword similarity matrix (Lin, 1998).
ATA v.1.0generates antonyms for vocabulary in the textusing WordNet?.2   Cognates are words whichhave the same spelling and meaning in twolanguages (e.g., animal in English and Spanish).The tool generates these using an ETSEnglish/Spanish cognate lexicon.2.3 English and Spanish Text-to-SpeechThe tool offers English and Spanish text-to-speech (TTS)3.
English TTS may be useful forpronunciation support, while Spanish TTSprovides access to the Spanish texts for Spanish-speaking ELLs who are not literate in Spanish.1 See http://www.languageweaver.com2 See http://wordnet.princeton.edu/3 See http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/  &http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/tts/download/.3Figure 1.

Pilot Study with TeachersThe survey feedback indicated that the 12 teacherswere positive about the tool?s potential.
Overall,the vocabulary and English marginal notes werethe most favorite features, while the text-to-speechwas the least favorite.
Teachers commented thatthey would like to see an editing capability addedthat would allow them to make changes to theautomatically generated outputs (i.e., vocabularysupport, and English and Spanish marginal notes.
)Teachers viewed the tool either as lesson planningsupport, or as a student tool for independent work.4.
Future ResearchATA v.1.0 is a young application that uses NLPmethods to create text adaptations.
The teacher pilotevaluation suggested that it produces adaptationswith potentially effective support for ELLs.
It couldalso save teachers lesson planning time.
We arecurrently implementing teacher-suggestedmodifications, and planning a larger, school-basedpilot.
The pilot will evaluate the tool?s effectivenessin terms of measurable learning gains in readingcomprehension and English language skills.ReferencesCarlo, M.S., August, D., McLaughlin, B., Snow, C.E.,Dressler, C., Lippman, D., Lively, T. & White, C.(2004).
