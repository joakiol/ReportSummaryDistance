"Is Speech Language?
".Organ isers :  Joseph Mar ian i  (L IMS I ,  Par i s ) ,  S teven  Krauwer  (OTS,  Ut recht )Most people would not hesitate to give an affir-mative answer to the question whether speech islanguage.
It seems so obviously true.
Yet, whenlooking at what is happening in the language andspeech research community one may feel temptedto believe that the two topics are totally unre-lated: language and speech researchers have theirown conferences, their own journals, and their ownprofessional ssociations.
They have their own re-search projects, their own technological goals, andattending their conferences and reading their jour-nals reveals a large number of differences in cul-ture, style and approach.These observations give raise to a number ofquestions, such as: - Are the observations correct,or is it just a matter of misperception, caused byfocussing on the differences rather than the sim-ilarities.
- What causes the differences: is it thefact that language and speech problems ARE dif-ferent, is it a matter of background and education,or is it a combination of both.
- Is the separa-tion of the two communities as justified as e.g.the separation between astrology and astronomy,or should it be seen as a problem we should tryto solve.
- Would NLP and Speech benefit fromcollaboration (new and better insights, theories,products), or would they just be in each other'sway?This panel, organised by ELSNET (The Euro-pean Network in Language and Speech) will ad-dress (amongst others) the questions formulatedabove.
A number of prominent workers in thefields of NLP and Speech have been invited topresent and confront heir views, and it is hopedthat the audience will actively participate in thediscussion.996
