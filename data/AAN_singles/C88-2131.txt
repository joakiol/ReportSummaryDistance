ON THE SEMANTICS OF FOCUS PHENOMENA IN EUROTRAErich H. STEINER Jutta WINTER-THIELENIAI Eurotra-D 1A1 Eurotra-DMartin Luther Str.14 Martin Luther Str.14D-6600 Saarbriicken D-6600 SaarbrtiekenFRG FRGABSTRACTIn this paper, we discuss issues connected to the phenomenon oflinguistic FOCUS or INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION in thesentence in the context of the multi-lingual machine translationproject EUROTRA.
We shall present some of the argumentswhy a consideration of FOCUS phenomena is important for thedetermination of linear order and for semantic interpretation.We shall proceed, in sections 2 and 3 of the paper, to mentionthe main lines of development in the dicussion of FOCUSphenomena in Computational Linguistics and in Linguisticsrespectively.
Section 4 contains an illustration of a pilotimplementation covering some aspects of FOCUS phenomena inEUROTRA-D.1.
Problem description1.1.
The determination f linear order in the clauseAn initial, but faulty assumption, underlying a possible theoryof language is that linear order of syntactic onstituents in theclause is fully determined by a combination of the followingtypes of information:- basic type of language (SVO,SOV,etc)- clause modus (indicative, interrogative,etc.
)- information on verbs in the lexicon (lexical forms).This paper will present some of the arguments why thisassumption is wrong for the clause, in how far this fact isrelevant for EUROTRA, and initial suggestions towards atreatment within our framework.
We shall not be able here, forreasons of time, to deal with linear order within NPs, ADJPs, orADVPs (cf.
for English on these questions Halliday.1985 : 158ff,and many others).At least the following hierarchy of factors can be said tocontribute to linear sequence (cf.
Allen.1987 : 51):(1) The familiarity hierarchy(2) The topic < comment, given < new hierarchies(3) The universal sequencing conventions(4) The definitieity and referentiality hierarchies(5) The personal, social status, and role hierarchies(6) The dominant descriptor hierarchies(7) The formal hierarchiesOf these, this paper will deal with focus phenomena, covered in(2) above.
Different aspects of this area are covered in thelinguistic literature under the headings of "topic-comment","focus-presupposition", "theme-rheme", and "given-new".
Thedifficulty with these pairs of terms is- that they reflect a difference in orientation (rhetorical vs.logical vs. psychological);- that they cover the related, though different aspects of linearorder and intonation.630Rather than go into an extended theoretical discussion at thispoint, we shall in 1.2. discuss a range of examples to showwhere exactly these phenomena would seem to be relevant for amulti-lingual MT-system like EUROTRA.
The system withinwhich the implementation of the ideas suggested here wereimplemented is the Eurotra-D system as described inSteiner,1986 and Steiner et alforthcoming and in other places.1.2.
The relevance of linear order for semantic interpretation1.2.1.
The scope of negationCf.
the following pair of sentences (capitals tanding for stress):(1) The eee is not controversial, because it is a multi-natlonalORGANIZATION.
(2) Because it is a multi-national organization the eec is notCONTROVERSAL(1) and (2) are identical, except for the position of the AdverbialClause, and the assignment of primary information focusrealized by main stress and symbolized here by capitals.However, their semantic interpretation differs with respect othe scope of negation: (1) is ambiguous with respect to thequeston of whether or not the propostion expressed in thematrix clause is true, cf.
(3):?
(3) The eee is not controversial, because it is a multi-nationalORGANISATION.
It is controversial because it is EXPENSIVE.The second sentence in (3) is not possible with (1), whereas it iswith (2).
In (1), the scope of negation includes the AdverbialClause, whereas in (2), it does not.
In general, it seems to be thecase that the scope of negation may include everything in theclause to the right of the negation particle and including theconstituent which has a lexical item carrying focus.
Therefore,the truth values of (1) and (2) are different, which implies thatthey are not acceptable translations of each other in a truthvalue oriented semantics, uch as we are having it at the momentin EUROTRA.
Yet, in the present framework, (1) and (2) wouldreceive one representation at ERS, which means that ECS-ERStranslations are not translationally equivalent.
The implicationsfor other pairs of levels of representation are obvious.We shall not go into the question here of how marked intonationin such cases would influence truth values - as we ar0 dealingwith written texts exclusively, we shall assume unmarkedintonation for each syntactic structure, which implies that in thecase of thematizing constructions, we shall assume main stress inthe constituent functioning as a marked theme, and stress withinthe rightmost clause constituent carrying a fully lexical itemotherwise.
All this, for the time being, applies to English.1.2.2, The scope of quantificationCf.
(4) and (5):i4) Everyone in this room speaks two languages.
(5) Two languages are spoken by everyone in this room.This is a classical example which has been discussed in theliterature again and again, so we shall merely re-state theproblem:In (4), it is not implied that everyone speaks the same twolanguages, whereas this does seem to be the implication in (5).The difficulty seems to be that type and scope of underlyingquantifiers may change depending on linear order.This problem may be even more important in languages with asomewhat freer word order like German, cf.
(21)-(24):(21) Einit~e yon uns haben eine Serge.Some of us have a worry.
(22) Eine Serge haben einige von uns.A worry some of us have.
(23) Wit alle arbeiten an einer L~sung.All of us a working towards a solution.
(24) An einer L6sung wird von alien von uns gearbeitet.A solution is worked on by all of us.In (21) and (23), the indefinite article in the object NP does notnecessarily imply "one and the same for all of (Subject)",whereas the implication may be given in (22) and (24) (changesof syntactic constituents considered).
Note that (24) includespassiviz~ttion, whereas (22) includes thematization withoutpassivizalion.
This shows that what is at issue here is notVOICE, but, as we have been emphasizing all the time, FOCUS.Howevel, it seems to be type, rather than scope ofquantification which is at issue here.
Furthermore, thejudgements of native speakers here arc influenced by intonationand ethel factors.1,2.3.
Acceptable question-answer pairsFor an illustration of this problem, cf, (6) to (11):(6) When did Parliament decide on tile budget?
(7) Parliament decided oil the budget last WEEK.
(8) It was last WEEK that Parliament decided on the budget,(9) ?Lasl week Parliament decided on the BUDGET.
(10) ?It was on the BUDGET that Parliament decided last week.
(l 1) ?What Parliament DID last week was decide on the budget.As it is well known from discussions in tile literature, (7) and(8) are fine as answers to (6), yet (9)-(11) are at leastquestionable.
Observe that thematizing devices like in (8)-(11)do not tlanslate in simple syntactic transfer between differentEuropean languages.
German, for example, can simply changelinear order where English needs clefting, pseudo-clef ring,extraposition, or similar devices.
Observe furthermore that, as afirst rule, focus goes with tile thematized constituent in cases ofmarked theme assignment, wbereas the remainder of the clausewould seem to function as presupposition, which is important toobserve ia the case of written language, wbere we do not haveany encoding of intonation directly.
In the case of wh-questions,focus usually goes with tile wh-elemeut.
In cases of unmarkedtheme a~;signment, focus, in English, falls on the last fullylexical item in the clause.Back now to the question of the translation of sentences withcertain types of marked themes, cf.
(12) to (15):(12) Zu elnem groBen UNGL~CK wurde die Entscheidung erstdutch die weitere ENTW1CKLUNG (D)(13) ?A big DESASTER the decision only became because offurther DEVEI,OPMENTS(14) It was only through further DEVELOPMENTS that thedecison became a DESASTER.
(15) ?Es war nut dureh die weitere Entwickluug, dassdie Entscheidung zu einem Ungliiek wurde.
(13) is a questionable translation of (12), yet the presentframework would either dictate so, or else produce the"canonical" form underlying (16) as a translation of (12):(16) The decision became a desaster because of furtherDEVELOPMENTS.
(16), however, misses the double focus of (12) and is thusproblematic, also in view of what we have said in 2.2.1.On the other hand, (15) is a questionable translation of (14),because the syntactic device of "clef ring" does not carry overfrom English into German in a non-complex way.We shall not go into other areas where FOCUS is important atthis point, such as, for example, the scope of certain classes ofAdverbials like "only, just,..." in English (we would like toexpress our gratitutde to Auand Syea, Manchester, for alertingus to this area.
)It should be obvious that:a: These problems occur not just in isolated examples, but withthematizing devices in general.b: The problems are magnified greatly between languages wbicbare less closely related than English and German, such as, forexample, Germanic and Romance languages etc.As we hope to have indicated in this section, a disregard forquestions of focus may lead to translations which are not truthvalue equivalent, or else to translations which are grammaticallywrong or at least hardly acceptable.
One could, of course, choosetile approach of introducing complex syntactic transfer to handlesuch problems.
It should be obvious that the complexitiesinvolved would be considerable.
Even in a syntax based transfer,though, one would need a systematic account of focusphenomena.The alternative would seem to be to include into EUROTRAInterface Structure semantic information about focus phenomenaand let the rest be handled in target language generation.
Thisseems to be a solution which is theoretically more desirable andpractically far superior in view of the fact that with the numberof languages involved in EUROTRA, introducing a majorsource of complex syntactic transfer is always extremely costlyand should be avoided as far as possible.The following two sections will give references to places in theliterature where focus phenomena re discussed moreextensively.2.
Issues in the discussion of focus phenomena:Computational LinguisticsThe relevance of focus phenomena and topicalization for freeword order languages i discussed in Karttunen/Kay.1985.A criticism of the general neglect of focus phenomena ndtopicalization can be found in Kay.1985 : 252, as well as inWinograd.1983 : 280ff.McDonald.1985 discusses the relevance of such phenomena forthe production of coherent text in MT.Mann/Matthiessen.1985 emphasize the need for having a theoryand implementation of topicalization in text generation,illustrating the particular strength of implementations ofSystemic Functional Grammar in this area, just as doWinograd .1983 : 280f f ,  Pat ten .1984,  andHoughton/Isard.forthcoming.Recent contributions of Prague School representatives on theissues connected with our topic can be found inHajicova/Sgall.1986 and in Sgall/Hajicova/Panevova.
in press.631Within the field of Machine Translation, it would seem to beclearly the Prague School approach which has the strongesttradition with respect to our topic.
Functional UnificationGrammar and Systemic Functional Grammar both have a knownhistory in this respect in Computational Linguistics, even if notin MT directly.3.
Issues in the discussion of focus phenomena:LinguisticsWe shall only be able to give an indication of the main lines ofthought ,  because  the l i te ra ture  on i ssues  offocus/presupposit ion, theme/rheme and topic/comment hasbecome very extensive.Within the paradigm of Generative Grammar and Government& Binding, we find, roughly from the early seventies onwards, adiscussion of focus phenomena in so far as they contribute to asemantic structure of focus and presupposition (cf.
Chomsky.1970, Jackendoff.
1972 , Jackendoff.
1983, Rochemont.1986).The emphasis is on the implications for scope of negation,Adverbials, and quantification, as well as on rules forgenerating acceptable sequences of sentences (cf.
1.2. of thispaper).The Prague School has perhaps 'the longest tradition ofinvestigating focus phenomena under the heading of "FunctionalSentence Perspective" organization of the clause (of.Danes.F.ed.1974.).
The notions of "Theme" and "Rheme" arerefined in order to overcome a purely binary division of theclause, using the notion of "Communicative Dynamism".
Also,the notions of "Theme and Rheme" are extended to cover aspectsof text-structure, rather than only sentence-structure.Lexical Functional Grammar, to my knowledge, has not given acentral place to consideration of focus phenomena, while notdenying their importance (cf.
Kaolan/Bresnan.
1982 : 255).However, in the area of LFG, my knowledge of the literature isfar from comprehensive.Systemic Functional Grammar has a long tradition of giving acentral place in their theory for considerations of the "textualorganization" of sentences into "Theme-Rheme" and "Given-New".
These two aspects are conceived of as related, thoughdistinct.
The "Given-New" dimension expresses the assignmentof "old vs new" information in the clause, whereas the "Theme-Rheme" dimension is assumed to account for "Point ofdeparture"-assignment to constituents of syntactic structure (el.Halliday, 1967-68./ Halliday.1985:38ff/ Fawcett.1980:157ff/Steiner.1983 : 228ff).Outside of certain "Schools" of Linguistics, it is certainly worthmentioning Chafe.
1970:210ff, Prince.1981 for an interestingtreatment of focus phenomena within the perspective ofPragmatics, Sperber/Wilson.1986 for a definition of "focus" withrespect o hierarchies of ordered entailments between differentsyntactic and semantic constituents of sentences, and Jones.1977.
for a very useful treatment of the notion of "Theme" as itextends from the sentence to the text.4.
Towards a treatment of the semantics of focus phenomena inEUROTRA: some preliminary suggestionsIn this section, we shall outline an implementation of atreatment which will at least begin to cover some of thetranslationally relevant phenomena which we have outlined in?
the previous ections.
This implementation is entirely within theEUROTRA framework as described in Arnold et a1.1986.For the time being, we shall assume that each clause constituentis assigned to either the focus or the presupposition f a clause.Later on, it may become important to distinguish more preciselybetween "clause" and "sentence", and between primary andsecondary focus.
Also, there are reasons to assume that focus isassigned to lexical categories in the first instance, and thatupwards percolation to the phrase is not unrestricted.
However,at present, we shall only try to account for movement of phrasalconstituents a  wholes, and therefore, we shall assume that focusis automatically percolated upwards from lexical categories totheir phrasal mothers.
Note that in the future this might createspecial problems as it is not necessarily the head element of aphrase which is marked for focus.For work in the immediate future, it seems important toinvestigate a somewhat more constrained interpretation of thepercolation of the feature \[+FOCUS\].
We shall in the followinguse~ome of the insights to be found in Roehemont.1986:84ff:a.
If some constituent A is \[+focus\] and A is X ?, then X n is\[+focus\].b.
If A is \[+focus\] and A is an argument of X ?
contained in X n,then X ?
is \[+focus\].e.
If X ?
is \[+focus\] and A is an Adjunct of X ?, then A is\[+focus\].From a.-c. above it follows that focus percolation operatesdifferently on arguments and on modifiers: \[focus\] percolatesupwards from arguments to heads (b.)
and reverse (a.
),.However, \[focus\] percolates downwards from heads to modifiers(c.), yet not in the reverse direction.
Now, while this is certainlyan interesting hypothesis, it should be investigated before webase any implementations on it.From a linguistic point of view, the semantics of focus andpresupposition determines linear sequence at ECS in interactionwith intonation (stress assignment).
For an illustration of thisfact, ef.
(17) to (20) (Jaekendoff.1972:321):(17) Did Maxwell kill the judge with a HAMMER?
(18) Was it with a HAMMER that Maxwell killed the judge?
(19) No, he killed him with a ZAPGUN.
(20) No, it was SAM who killed the judge.Jaekendoff's point here is that in a polar interrogative it is thefocus rather than the presupposition which is questioned~ andthat therefore (20) is odd as a response to (17) or (18), both ofwhich presuppose that Maxwell did the killing.Our point here is that (171 to (20) exhibit unmarked stressassignment relativ to their syntactic structures, and that markedassignments are possible, even if they are unlikely.
As we shallargue shortly, the knowledge of unmarked stress assignments forthe major syntactic patterns of a language is important in ourcontext, because when dealing with written texts, stress itself isnot accessible to us.
Observe that "focus" and "stress assignment"are not the same phenomenon: in the case of wh-questions inEnglish and German, for example, focus goes with the wh-element rather than with the element carrying primary stress.For each of the EUROTRA languages, there would seem to bean unmarked stress assignment to ECS (Eurotra ConstituentStructure) translations of one ERS (Eurotra Relational Structure)representation, e.g.
in cases of fronting," dislocation, cleftsentences, pseudo-claft sentences, extraposition, actives vs.passives etc.
Assuming unmarked stress assignment, we couldthen predict he elements of sentences which carry focus.
In thecase of wh-questions, focus will always be assigned to the wh-element.Within our framework, we can introduce an attribute-value pair"FOCUS=yes/no" which is included into the feature description632of syntactic onstituents in the course of translating from ECS toERS.
Thus, we translate the information which we haveavailable at ECS (linear sequence, whether we have a wh-question etc,) to ERS.
The linguistic basis of this knowledge isthe knowledge about unmarked stress assignments on ECS foreach of thn EUROTRA languages plus tim assumption ofunmarked intonation throughout, which is an assumption thatwe could modify in a controlled way at a later stage.From ERS to IS, our FOCUS feature and its value would simplybe carried over, which is a natural consequence of the fact thatinformat ion about focus and presupposit ion is semanticinformation based on information from the constituent s ructurelevel.
Our sentence (1)(1) The eec is not controversial, because it is a multi-nationalorganization.thus receives two representations both at ERS and at IS, whereassentence number (2)(2) Because it is a multi-national organization the eec is notcontroversial.receives only one represemation.
I  such cases, the difference isnot only in the area of FOCUS assignment, but is also due todifferences in scope assignment in tbe case of (1), which isdependent on the ECS position of the element carrying FOCUS.So far, we have sketched an approach to the problems ofFOCUS, yet not automatically to problems of scope of negationand quantification.
The reason is that in our representations atERS and at IS, each sister constituent of one level has to beeither a predicate or an argument/modifier.
A negative particlelike English "not", however, does not seem to be one or the otherat clause level.
Semantically speaking, "not" correspondes to alogical operator ather than to a predicate or an argument.
Inother words, our IS or ERS representations do not correspond toa "logical form", which would represent problems of scope in theusual way, e.g.
(roughly):(NOT a(X)) AND b(Y) vs. NOT((a(X))AND(b(Y))).Within our present framework, a possible approach would seemto be the following:We define a feature SCOPEN=yes/no (Scope of negation) whichis assigned to clause constituents in the translation ECS->ERS.As we assume that tbe scope of negation may include all theconstituents right of the negative particle at ECS up to theconstituent dominating the element carrying FOCUS, we couldassign a SCOPEN value to constituents in the course oftranslation ECS->ERS and then simply carry it over to IS.
Theisssue we have to decide on in this context is whether we wantto introduce this additional source of creating ambiguities intothe framework.
Note that scope is said to extend "up to" theFOCUS constituents, yet this may or may not be the case, whichexactly is the problem in (1) above.
(2) is not ambiguous,because the adverbial clause is definitely out of the scope ofnegation.
Ambiguities are created in all those cases where wehave constituents between the negative particle and the FOCUS,and in the case of longer clauses, this my cause a high numberof readings which only differ in the scope of negation.lt is notobvious at the moment whether the magnitude of the problemcreated by questions of scope is sufficient to warrant such astep.
Our treatment of FOCUS, it should be said, does not createadditional ambiguities at this stage, it merely adds to the featuredescriptions in representations which we are generating anyway.Our Appendix contains representations showing the operation ofthe FOCUS feature in ECS and ERS structures.REFERENCESAllan.K.19g7.
