Description Formation and Discourse Model SynthesisBonnie Lynn WebberBolt Beranek and Newman Inc.50 Moulton StreetCambridge MA 02138 <*i>I.
IntroductionMany researchers in linguistics,psychology, philosophy and artificialintelligence have recently begun toabandon a purely linguistic approach todefinite anaphora <*2> in favor of anotion of reference into some kind ofmodel of the discourse, cf.
Karttunen\[1976\], Levin & Goldman \[1978\], Lyons\[1978\].
Stenning \[1975\].
My own researchon definite anaphora (cf.
Webber\[1978a&b\]) follows this approach, inparticular making the following fiveassumptions:i.
One objective of discourse is toenable a speaker to communicate to alistener a model s/he has of somesituation.
Thus the ensuingdiscourse is, on one level, anattempt by the speaker to direct thelistener in synthesizing a similarmodel.2.
Such a discourse model can be viewedas a structured collection ofentities, organized by the rolesthey fill with respect to oneanother, the relations theyparticipate in, etc.3.
The function of a definite anaphoricexpression is to refer to an entityin the speaker's discourse model(DMs).
<*3> In using a definiteanaphor, the speaker assumes(a) that on the basis of thediscourse thus far, a similar entity<*i>.
The author's current address is:Department of Computer and InformationSciences, The Moore School, University ofPennsylvania, Philadelphia PA 19174.<*2>.
Although I will soon explain what Imean precisely by "definite anaphora", theterm basically denotes a function thatsome types of syntactic expressions canserve.
Expressions which can function asdefinite anaphors include definitepronouns and definite descriptions.
Otherroles that definite pronouns anddescriptions can fill are discussed inGeach \[1962\], Partee \[1972\], Norman &Rumelhart \[1975\] and Webber \[1978a\].<*3>.
A similar assumption is made byKarttunen \[1976\], Levin & Goldman \[1978\],Lyons \[1978\] and Stenning \[1975\].will be in the l istener's model(DML) as well and (b) that thelis?ener will be able to access thatentity via the given definitedescription or definite pronoun.4.
The referent of a definite anaphoris thus an entity in DMs, which thespeaker presumes to have acounterpart in DM L. Discourseentities may have the properties ofindividuals, sets, events, actions,states, facts, beliefs, hypotheses,properties, generic classes, typicalset members, stuff, specificquantities of stuff, etc.5.
In deciding which discourse entity adefinite anaphor refers to, alistener's judgments stem in partfrom how the entities in DMT aredescribed.
(When a discourse ~ntityE is the referent of a definiteanaphor A, one might distinguishthat description of E conveyed tothe listener by the immediatelypreceding text and consider it A'santecedent.
)The point of making these assumptionsexplicit is to stress that insofar asreasoning about discourse entities ismediated by their descriptions, discourseentity descriptions are critical toanaphor resolution.Now one consequence of theseassumptions about discourse models andreference is that the task ofunderstanding definite anaphora can bedecomposed into several complementaryparts:i. deciding whether a definite pronounor definite description is trulyanaphoric (i.e., is intended torefer to some entity presumed toalready be in DML) or whether theterm fills some other role in thediscourse;2. synthesizing a discourse model whichis similar to that of the speakerand inhabited by similar discourseentities;423. constraining the possible referentsof a given anaphoric express ion downto one possib le choice - the"anaphor resolut ion" problem;4. determining what other funct ions adef inite descr ipt ion is intended tofill besides enabl ing the l istenerto construct or get to its referent.While I cannot hope in this shortpaper to cover even one of these foursub-tasks, what I shall try to do isi l lustrate how the expl ic i t  data - i.e.,the actual sentences of the discourse,produced by a part icular  person (or apart icular computer program) in apart icular s i tuat ion  - provide mater ia lfor the model synthesis process.
Inpart icular,  I shall show (i) howindef inite noun phrases are associatedwith the evocat ion of new discourseentit ies, independent ly  of anyhigher- level  expectat ions,  and (2) howthose new discourse ent i t ies willinit ial ly be described.
I wil l  c laim thatsuch an initial descr ipt ion (ID) iscr it ical  to both model synthesis andanaphor resolut ion since it al lows thel istener to reason appropr iate ly  about thediscourse entity in order to assign it toan appropr iate role v is -a-v is  his or herhigher- level  expectat ions.
<*4>Moreover, since it is possib le for ad iscourse entity's current role ass ignmentto be found incorrect, it is the ent i ty 'sID that al lows it to be re-ass igned toanother role with respect to thel istener's revised expectat ions.In Section 2 I wil l  considerindefinite noun phrases v is-a-v is  thediscourse entit ies they evoke and howthose entit ies are described.
I wil lcontrast  them br ief ly with non-anaphor icdef inite noun phrases and then show thatall determined noun phrases, including oddones like "few orc eggs", "many lemon gumballs",  etc.
pattern after eitherdef in i tes or indef inites v is-a-v is  thediscourse entit ies they evoke and howthose entit ies can be described.
InSection 3 I wil l show how this approach todef inite anaphora  in terms of d iscourseentit ies and their descr ipt ions canaccommodate certain problemat ic  cases ofanaphoric reference that have beendiscussed in the l inguist ics andphi losophic  l i teratures - the famous"donkey" sentence (cf.
Bartsch \[1976\],Edmundson \[1976\], Hint ikka & Carlson\[1977\]) and the problem of reference ind is junct ive contexts (cf.
Karttunen\[1977\]).
Finally, to show that it is not<*4>.
F rom d i f fe rent  points Of view,d iscussions of the re lat ionship betweenthe expl ic i t  text and higher- levelorganiz ing structures can be ~ found inColl ins, Brown & Larkin \[1977\] and Webber\[1978b\].just def in ite and indef inite noun phrasesthat can evoke ent i t ies in the l istener 'sd iscourse model, I wil l  i l lustrate inSect ion 4 an example of de ic t ica l ly -evokedent i t ies and comment on the problem ofdescr ib ing them appropr iately.2.
Indef in i te Noun Phrases and DiscourseEnt i t iesExcept after a copula, indefinitenoun phrases <*5> may evoke a newdiscourse entity into a l istener 'sd iscourse model.
<*6> What I want tofocus on here is appropr iate IDs for them.Consider the fol lowing sentences.la.
Wendy bought a ye l low T-shirt thatBruce had liked.b.
It cost twenty dol lars.2a.
Each third-grade girl brought apel ican to Wendy's house.b.
She is roosting them on her frontlawn.3a.
If Bruce manages to catch a fish,b.
he will eat it for dinner.4a.
John didn't  marry a Swedish woman.b.
She was Norwegian.5a.
Whether Bruce buys a mini -computeror an Advent TV,b.
he will have to do the repairs on ithimself.6.
Every man who owns a donkey beatsit.I c laimed earl ier that the init ialdescr ipt ion (ID) of a newly-evokeddiscourse entity is cr i t ical  for bothmodel synthesis and anaphor resolut ion,since the ID mediates all reasoning aboutthe entity until its ass ignment to somerole within the model.
An ent i ty 's  IDshould imply neither more nor less aboutit than is appropriate.
Now consider whatan appropr iate descr ipt ion would be forthe discourse entity that "it" refers toin sentence lb.
It is not "the yel lowT-shirt that Bruce had l iked", sincesentence  la.
can be uttered truthful lyeven if Bruce had liked several yel lowT-shirts (and both speaker and l istenerwere aware of that fact).
Nor is it "theyel low T-shirt that Bruce had l iked andthat Wendy bought", since sentence la.
can<#5>.
i wi l l  often .... refer to these  as"existent ia ls"  because of their logicalinterpretat ion as existent ia l  quanti f iers.<*6>.
An indefinite noun phrase fol lowinga copula functions together with thecopula as a predicate, e.g.Bever ly is a bargain hunter.Bruce became a l ibrarian.As such, it is purely descr ipt ive and doesnot refer to any part icular l ibrar ian orbargain hunter, cf.
Kuno \[1970\].43be truthful ly  uttered even if Wendy hadbought several such T-shirts.
What is anappropr iate descr ipt ion for the referentof "it" is something like "the yel lowT-shirt  that Bruce had l iked and thatWendy bought and that was ment ioned insentence la.
"What I am claiming is that in thecase of a singular existent ia l  that is notwithin the scope of either negation, auniversal  quanti f ier,  a hypothet ica l  (e.g.
"if", "suppose") or one of several otherspecial  contexts (cf.
Webber \[1978a\]), theent i ty  it evokes wil l  be appropr iate lydescr ibed via a conjunct ion of (i) thedescr ipt ion inherent in the noun phrase(e.g.
"yel low T-shirt  that Bruce hadadmired");  (2) a predicate that embodiesthe remainder of the sentence (e.g.
"whichWendy bought");  and (3) a predicate thatrelates that ent i ty to the utteranceevoking it (e.g.
"which was ment ioned in(or evoked by) sentence 6a.").
This isthe descr ipt ion that I am cal l ing theent i ty 's  " init ial  descr ipt ion" or ID.Given how I speci f ied its components then,it should not be surpr is ing that I wil lc la im that the ID of anex is tent ia l ly -evoked d iscourse ent i ty canbe derived from an appropr iate lystructured sentence- level  logicalrepresentat ion.
Such a representat ion isindependent ly mot ivated by its use inregular inference procedures.Using a somewhat s impl i f ied vers ionof the formal ism descr ibed in Webber\[1978a\], a simple rule can be stated forforming the ID of an ex is tent ia l ly  evokeddiscourse entity - i.e.,(Ex:C) F x ==>(Ezi z = ix: Cx & F x & evoke S,xHere (Ex:C) is an example of restr ictedquant i f icat ion,  in which C represents anarbi t rary predicate which x satisf ies.
Fxrepresents an arbi t rary open sentence inwhich x is free; i stands for Russel l 'sdef in i te operator,  iota; and S is thelabel assigned to the propos i t ion on theleft -hand side of the arrow.
Informally,this rule, which I shall  call \[RW-I\], saysthat if a proposi t ion S states that thereis a member x of class C which makes F.true, then there exists an individua~descr ibable as "the C which F's which wasevoked by proposi t ion S".
This individualis taken to be the discourse ent i ty evokedby the existent ia l  noun phrase.
Forexample ,  let Y stand for the predicatecorresponding to "yel low T-shirt  thatBruce had l iked".
<*7> Then sentence la.can be represented simply as<*7>.
I wil l soon be more precise aboutthe representat ion of relat ive clausecontain ing noun phrases.
Here, where thedescr ipt ive part of the noun phrase can betreated as an unanalyzed unit, thepredicate name Y is an adequaterepresentat ion.
(Ex :Y )  .
Bought Wendy, xSince this matches the left -hand side ofthe above rule, it fol lows that(Ez) .
z = ix: Y x & Bought Wendy,x& evoke Sla,XThat is, there is an individualdescr ibable  as "the yel low T-shirt  thatBruce had liked, that Wendy bought andthat was evoked by sentence la."
Thed iscourse entity so descr ibed is thereferent of "it" in sentence lb.Examples 2-6 i l lustrate singularindef inite noun phrases in some of thespecial  contexts noted above.
Whi le Iwil l  only be discussing examples 5 and 6in this paper, notice that in all fivecases, the entity evoked by the indef initenoun phrase is appropr iate ly  descr ibed bytaking into account at least the threefactors ment ioned above.
That is, inexample 2 the referent of "them" can bedescr ibed uniquely as "the set ofpel icans,  each of which, ment ioned insentence 2a., some third grade girlbrought to Wendy's house."
<*8> Inexample 3, the referent of "it" can bedescr ibed as "the fish ment ioned in c lause3a.
that Bruce has managed to catch, ifBruce has managed to catch a fish".
Inexample 4, the negat ion appears intendedto scope only "Swedish".
Thus thed iscourse entity referent of "she" can bedescr ibed as "the woman ment ioned insentence 4a.
that John marr ied".
(Welater learn in sentence 4b.
that she isNorwegian rather than Swedish.)
IDs forthe two other ex is tent ia l ly -evokedd iscourse ent i t ies in examples 5 and 6wil l  be d iscussed in Sect ion 3.Notice that a def in i te noun phrase inthe same context as an indef inite nounphrase wil l  also evoke a d iscourse entity,but one whose ID is somewhat di f ferent.To see this, consider the fol lowingsentences.< '8> A rule simii&r {o \[RWLi\] is g~venin Webber \[1978a\] for ex istent ia ls  scopedby universals.
In all, six such rules aregiven, coveringi.
independent ex istent ia ls  (sg/pl)"I saw {a cat, three cats} on thestoop."2.
def in i te  descr ipt ions (sg/pl)"I saw the {cat, cats\] which hate(s)Sam."3.
d is t r ibut ives"Each cat on the stoop hates Sam.
""The three cats each scratched Sam."4.
universal ly  quant i f ied ex istent ia ls"Each boy gave each girl {a peach,three peaches}."5.
class dependent  def in i tes"Each boy gave a woman he knew the{peach, two peaches} she wanted."6.
class dependent  d is t r ibut ives"Each boy I know loves every womanhe meets."447a.
Wendy bought the yel low T-shirt  thatBruce had liked.b.
It cost twenty dol lars.8a.
Each third grade girl has seen thepel ican on Wendy's  lawn.b.
They prefer it to the plast icf lamingo she had there before.9a.
John didn't  marry the Swedish woman.b.
He threw her over for a Welshecdysiast.In each case, an appropr iate descr ipt ionfor the discourse ent i ty evoked by thesingular def in i te noun phrase is just thatsingular def in i te noun phrase itself -"the yel low T-shirt that Bruce had l iked","the pel ican on Wendy's  lawn", "theSwedish woman".
While it is certa in lytrue that the def in i teness  of these nounphrases may be cont ingent  on context(i.e., ident i f iab i l i ty  with in thespeaker 's  model of the under ly ings ituat ion),  nevertheless  unlike ent i t iesevoked by indefinite noun phrases,  thoseevoked by def in i tes do not depend fortheir appropr iate IDs on the part icu larsentences the def in i te noun phrasesappeared in.The same character is t ic  behavior ofdef in i tes and indef in i tes d iscussed forsingular noun phrases holds for pluralnoun phrases as well.
That is, whi le bothindef inite and def in i te plural  nounphrases evoke discourse entit ies,  theunique initial descr ipt ions  that can beassigned to those ent i t ies wil l  di f fer inthe two cases.
To see this, consider thefol lowing example.10a.
I saw the guys from "Kiss" on TVtoday.b.
I saw the three guys from "Kiss" onTV today.c.
I saw all three guys from "Kiss" onTV today.d.
I saw some guys from "Kiss" on TVtoday.e.
I saw three guys from "Kiss" on TVtoday.ii.
They were being interviewed by DickCavett.Sentences 10a-c each contains a def in i teplural  noun phrase.
That noun phraseshould evoke a d iscourse ent i ty into thel istener 's  model, one appropr iate lydescr ibed as "the (set of) guys from'Kiss'" This can be ver i f ied byfol lowing either of these sentences bysentence ii and cons ider ing what is thereferent of the def in i te pronoun "they".<*9><*9>.
While Sentences 10b&c.
prov{de theaddit ional  information that the number ofguys in "Kiss" is three \[not actual ly  true- BLW\], that information is not needed inorder to descr ibe the set uniquely.Sentences 10d&e, on the other hand,each contains an i~def in i te plural  nounphrase.
That noun phrase wil l  evoke ad iscourse ent i ty appropr ia te ly  descr ibedas "the (set of) guys from 'Kiss' that Isaw on TV today and that was ment ioned inSentence 10d(e)."
This is because eithersentence is cons istent  with there beingother members of "Kiss" whom I d idn' t  seeon TV today, as well as other members whomI did see but whom I don't  mean to includein my statement.
<'10> Notice again thatthe set size informat ion provided insentence 10e.
is not necessary fordescr ib ing that set uniquely.
However, ittoo may be useful later in resolvingdef in i te  anaphora.An interest ing point  is that thereseem to be no other patterns that Engl ishdeterminers  fo l low v is-a-v is  d iscourseent i ty IDs.
To see this consider thefo l lowing sentences.12a.
Few l inguists  smoke since they knowit causes cancer.b.
Few l inguists were at the party, butthey drank more than the whole ArmyCorps of Engineers.13a.
Many l inguists smoke al though theyknow it causes cancer.b.
Not many l inguists smoke since theyknow it causes cancer.c.
Many l inguists don't  smoke sincethey know it causes cancer.In sentence 12a, the referent of "they" isthe d iscourse ent i ty appropr ia te lydescr ibed as "(the entire set of)l inguists".
That is, "few <x>s" can evokethe same discourse ent i ty as the def in i tenoun phrase "the <x>s".
However asHowever, it should not be ignored, as itmay be needed later in resolv ing adef in i te anaphor like "the three guys".<'10>.
This latter point is a subtle one,and usage may vary from person to person.That is, some people intend an indefiniteplural noun phrase contained in a sentenceS - "Some <x>s P" - to refer to themaximal  set - i.e., "the set of <x>s whichP".
Other people intend it to refer tosome subset of that set - "the set of <x>swhich P which I (the speaker) intended toment ion in sentence S".
For a system tocope with this var iat ion in usage, itwould be better for procedures to der ivethe latter, non-maximal  set descr ipt ion,which is always appropr iate.
If a systemis sophist icated enough to associate a"bel ief  space" with the speaker (cf.
Cohen\[1978\]), other procedures can later accessthat bel ief  space (if necessary ordesirable) to judge whether the maximalset interpretat ion might have beenintended.
(This wil l  again become anissue when I d iscuss other determinerslike "many" and "several".
)45sentence 12b.
shows, "few <x>s" can alsopattern after the indefinite plural:  thereferent of "they" is the entityappropr iate ly  descr ibed as "thejust -ment ioned set of l inguists who wereat the party".
(We learn from "few" thatthis set is small or smaller than thespeaker expects.
)"Many", on the other hand, seems topattern only after the indefinite plural.In sentence 13a., the referent of "they"is appropr iate ly  descr ibed as "thejust -ment ioned set of l inguists whosmoke".
(We learn from "many" that thisset of l inguists is large or larger thanthe speaker expects.)
Sentence 13b.
showsthat the reverse polar i ty  "not many" actsl ike "few" v is-a-v is  evoking discourseentit ies:  the referent of "they" is theentire set of l inguists.
However assentence 13c.
shows, a NEG which occurs inthe sentence auxi l iary does not ef fectthis same change in behavior:  "they"refers to the just -ment ioned set ofl inguists who don't  smoke.3.
TWo Interest ing Reference ProblemsRecall  that the purpose of this paperis to point out the importance ofdescr ipt ion formation to both d iscoursemodel synthesis and reference resolut ionand to show that this process can, to animportant degree, be formalized.
I havetaken as given the notion that a l isteneris using both the d iscourse and his or herknowledge of the world to synthesize amodel of what s/he bel ieves to underl iethe discourse.
Def inite anaphora areviewed as means by which the speakerrefers to ent i t ies in DM s that arepresumed to have counterparts  in thel istener 's  model.
What I want to show inthis section is that this approach todef in i te anaphora can accommodate not onlyst ra ight - forward cases as d iscussed above,but cer ta in  problemat ic  cases as well.3.1 Parameter ized IndividualsThe problem of formal lycharacter iz ing the referent of "it" inexamples like 6 below has often beend iscussed in the l inguist ics andph i losophy  l i teratures,  cf.
Bartsch\[1976\], Edmundson \[1976\], Hint ikka &Car lson \[1977\].6.
Every man who owns a donkey beats it.The problem has been taken to be thatwhi le "it" intui t ively seems related tothe embedded noun phrase "a donkey", thereis no way to represent this log ica l ly  interms of simple quanti f ier  scoping.
WhatI shall show is that an approach in termsof d iscourse ent i t ies and their IDs makesthis intuit ive re lat ionship simple both toexpla in and to represent.First notice that this problem arisesindependent ly  of how the matr ix  nounphrase is determined.14.
A man I know who owns a donkey beatsit.15.
The man who owns a donkey beats it.16.
Which man who owns a donkey beatsit?17.
No man who owns a donkey beats it.In all these examples, "it" seemsintui t ively related to "a donkey".Informally,  one might  descr ibe itsreferent as "the just -ment ioned donkey heowns", where "he" is bound to whatevervalue that "(each, a, the, which, no) manwho owns a donkey" may take.
But this isjust a d iscourse ent i ty of a ratherspecial  type - one with a parameter izedID, rather than a rigid one.
I call suchent i t ies "parameter ized individuals",borrowing the term from Woods & Brachman\[1978\].
<*ii>Notice that parameter ized indiv idualsbehave somewhat d i f ferent ly  from the"actual" d iscourse ent i t ies the sentencesevoke.
<'12> That is, parameter izedindiv iduals all have the same ID,independent of how the noun phrasecontain ing the relat ive clause isdetermined.
On the other hand, the actuald iscourse ent i t ies evoked by thesesentences do not.
For example,18a.
Each man who owns a donkey beats it.it = the donkey he ownsb.
However, the donkeys are p lanning toget back at them.the donkeys = the set of donkeys,each of which some manwho owns a donkey ownsthem = the set of men, each of whomowns a donkey19a.
The man I know who owns a donkeybeats it.it = the donkey he ownsb.
But the donkey is p lanning to getback at him.the donkey = the just -ment ioneddonkey that the man Iknow who owns a donkeyownshim = the man I know who owns adonkey20a.
Which man who owns a donkey beatsit?<*ii>.
The phrase "parameter~zedindividual" is being used somewhat looselyto include "parameter ized" sets, stuff,etc.
For example,(i) No man who owns two donkeys beatsthem.them = the two donkeys he owns<'12>.
By "actual" d iscourse entit ies,  Imean ones that can be referred toanaphor ica l ly  in subsequent sentences.46it = the donkey he owns-- "None"b.
*Are the donkeys planning to get backat {him, them, ???
}?the donkeys = ???c.
*Is the donkey planning to get backat {him, them, ???
}?the donkey = ??
?To show that this approach todef inite anaphora in terms of d iscourseentit ies and their descr ipt ions canexpl icate "donkey" sentences as well, Iwil l  have to introduce a bit more of theformal ism descr ibed in Webber \[1978\].That bit involves an extension ofrestr icted quant i f icat ion,  cf.
\[RW-I\]above.
In restr icted quant i f icat ion,  aquant i f icat ion operator (e.g.
?,E), thevar iable of quant i f icat ion and the classit ranges over (noted impl ic i t ly  as apredicate) const i tute a structural  unit ofthe representat ion.
For example, "Everyboy is happy" can be represented as(?x:Boy) Happy xThis is truth funct ional ly  equivalent  to(?x) .
Boy x ==> Happy xSimi lar ly "Some boy is happy" can berepresented as(Ex:Boy) Happy xwhich is truth funct ional ly  equivalent  to(Ex) Boy x & Happy xThe extension I wil l introduce willpermit the representat ion of noun phraseswith relat ive clauses as well as simplenoun phrases.
Semantical ly,  a relat iveclause can be viewed as a predicate.
Oneway to provide for arbitrary predicates isthrough the use of the abstract ionoperator, represented as " " by Hughes &Cresswel l  \[1968\], fol lowing Church \[1941\].For example, the noun phrase "a peanut"can  be represented as(Ex:Peanut)whi le the noun phrase "a peanut that Wendygave to a gori l la" can be represented as(Ex: ~(u:Peanut)  \[(Ey:Goril la)Gave Wendy,u,y\])In this case~(u:Peanut) \[(Ey:Goril la)Gave Wendy,u,y\]names a unary predicate which is true ifits argument is a peanut that Wendy gaveto some gori l la.Using this notation, sentence 6 canbe represented as(?x:~(u:Man) \[ (Ey:Donkey) .
Own u,yJ) .Beat x , ITBy applying rule \[RW-I\] to the embeddedclause \[(Ey:Donkey) .
Own u\], the ent i tyevoked by the existent ia l  can beidenti f ied asiy: Donkey y & Own u,y & evoke S6.l ,U"the just -ment ioned donkey that u owns"<'13>As I ment ioned above, the semantics ofrestr icted quant i f icat ion is such that thevar iable of quant i f icat ion,  here x,sat isf ies the predicate in therestr ict ion.
Thus if x sat isf ies~(u:Man) \[(Ey:Donkey) .
Own u,y\], theremust be an entity ident i f iable asiy: Donkey y & Own x,y & evoke S 6 l,y"the just -ment ioned donkey x owns ~This is a parameter ized individual -parameter ized by the var iable in (?x:...)- that is a possible referent for "it" inthe matrix sentence - i.e.,(?x:~(u:Man) \[(Ey:Donkey) .
Own u,y\])Beat x, iy: Donkey y & Own x,y& evoke S6.l ,y"Every man who owns a donkey beats thejust -ment ioned donkey he owns"I noted above that a sentence like"Every man who owns a donkey beats it"could sensibly be fol lowed by a sentencelike "However, the donkeys are planning toget back at them" (cf.
example 18).
Giventhat I have shown how to account for thereferent of "it" in the first sentence interms of d iscourse ent i t ies and theirformally der ivable descr ipt ions,  can thereferent of "the donkeys" be account forin the same way?
<'14>To show that it can, I need topresent the rule for deal ing with classdependent def inite descr ipt ions that Iment ioned in footnote 8.
This rule ismotivated by examples such as 21, wherethe referent of "them" is presumably thediscourse entity evoked by the noun phrase"the flower she picked", where "she"stands for the variable bound by "eachgirl in the class".<'13>.
In label ing each clause of acomplex sentence, I use the fol lowingconvention: if the matr ix clause islabel led S, its leftmost embedded clausewill be label led S.I, the leftmostembedded clause in S.I wil l  be label ledS.I.I, etc.<'14>.
I shall not take the time here todiscuss the path from the phrase "everyman who owns a donkey" to the discourseentity informally descr ibable as "the setof men, each of whom owns a donkey", sinceit is rather stra ightforward,  cf.
Webber\[1978a\].
This ent ity is a possiblereferent for "them" in sentence 18b.4721a.
Each girl in the class gave Ivan theflower she picked.b.
He arranged them art fu l ly  in anempty Glenf iddach bottle.This is a def in i te noun phrase, butbecause of its binding to thed is t r ibut ive ly  quant i f ied noun phrase"each girl",  it wil l  evoke a d iscourseent i ty  with the propert ies  of a set ratherthan an individual (cf.
example 8).
Inthis case, it wil l  be "the set of f lowers,each of which was the flower that somegirl  in the class picked".
S impl i fy ingfor brevity here, this rule can be wr i t ten(Vx:K) .
P x , iy :C  x,y ==>(Ez) .
z = {ul (Ex:K) .
u = iy:C x,y}where K represents an arb i t rary  unarypredicate which x sat is f ies and both P andC represent  arb i t rary b inary predicates.The r ight-hand side of this rule impliesthat in case the left -hand side matchessome sentence, there wil l  be a d iscourseent i ty roughly descr ibable  as "the set ofu's, each of which is the thing thatstands in relat ion C to some member of K".Notice now that after the "it" isresolved in "Every man who owns a donkeybeats it" (see above), the sentencematches the left -hand side of the aboverule - i.e., "Every man who owns a donkeybeats  the  jus t -ment ioned  donkey  he owns .Thus it fol lows that there is a d iscourseent i ty  descr ibable  as "the set of donkeys,each of which is the just -ment ioned donkeythat some man who owns a donkey owns" -i.e.,{wl (Ex:~(u:Man) \[(Ey:Donkey) Own u,y\])w = iz: Donkey z & Own x,z& evoke Sl8,Z}This is a possib le referent for "them" insentence 18b.3.2 Dis junct ionThe other class of prob lemat icexamples that I want to d iscuss here interms of d iscourse ent i t ies and theirdescr ipt ions  is one I f irst encountered inKart tunen \[1977\].
Karttunen presentsexamples like the fol lowing.22.
If Wendy has a car or Bruce has abike, it wil l  be in the garage.23.
Bruce can have either a bike or acar, but he must keep it in thegarage.24.
Either Bruce has ~a new car or he hasborrowed his brother's.
In anycase, it is b locking my driveway.25.
Whether Bruce buys a car or hisbrother buys a bike, he wil l  have tokeep it in the garage.The problem is again to determine justwhat it is that "it" refers to.I see two ways of approaching thisproblem in terms of d iscourse ent i t ies andtheir IDs.
One way holds that in eachsentence,  each term of the d is junct ionevokes a d i f ferent  d iscourse ent i ty intoDML, each with a d i f ferent  ID:(22) "the car that Wendy has (if she hasa car)""the bike that Bruce has (if he hasa bike)"(23) "the bike that Bruce wil l  have (ifhe chooses a bike)""the car that Bruce wil l  have (if hechooses a car)"(24) "the new car that Bruce has (ifBruce has a new car)""Bruce's brother 's  car"(25) "the car Bruce wil l  have bought (ifhe buys a car)""the bike Bruce's brother wil l  havebought (if Bruce's brother buys abike)"The truth of the d is junct ion  (which seemsin each case to be interpreted asexc lus ive "or") then guarantees therebeing one and only one ent i ty in the modelto which "it" refers.
Not ice that if theterms were conjo ined rather thandis jo ined,  the truth of the con junct ionwould imply the s imultaneous ex istence oftwo ent i t ies with in the model.
In thatcase, either the referent of "it" would beambiguous or the sentence would just bebizarre.The other, I think nicer, way ofapproaching the problem holds that eachsentence evokes only a s ingle d iscourseent i ty into the model,  with the indecis ion(i.e., the dis junct ion) embodied in itsID.
That ID is of the form "A if P,otherwise B".
For example,  the ent i tyevoked by sentence 22 would be descr ibab leas "the car that Wendy has (if she has acar) or the bike that Bruce hasotherwise";  that evoked by sentence 23would be descr ibable  as "the bike thatBruce wil l  have (if he chooses a bike) orthe car that Bruce wil l  have otherwise";that evoked by sentence 24, as "the newcar that Bruce has (if he has a new car)or Bruce's brother 's  car otherwise";  andthat evoked by sentence 25, as "the carBruce wil l  have bought (if he buys a car)or the bike Bruce's brother wil l  havebought otherwise".One advantage to this approach isthat addit ional  propert ies  whicht ruthfu l ly  fo l low from either ID can beascr ibed to the ent i ty without  committ ingonesel f  to one descr ip t ion  or the other.This can be useful in anaphor resolut ion.For example, in sentence 24, the subject48of "block my driveway" must be a physicalobject, preferably large and somewhatmobile.
This condit ion is sat isf ied bythe discourse entity evoked by sentence24, independent of which ID isappropriate.Although there may be other ways toapproach the problem of dis junct ion,  the"donkey" problem, and the whole problem ofdef inite reference in general,  what I hopeto have shown in these two sections is therobustness of an approach based on notionsOf  a discourse model, d iscourse entit iesand their formally derived descr ipt ions.4.
Conc lus ionIn arguing for the importance ofdescr ipt ion formation to both discoursemodel synthesis and reference resolut ion,I concentrated on how indefinite nounphrases evoke new entit ies into thel istener's discourse model and how theirappropr iate initial descr ipt ions (IDs)could be derived from a formalsentence- level  representat ion of the text.There are many other ways in whichdiscourse entit ies can be evoked, and manyinterest ing problems in formingappropr iate descr ipt ions of them.
I wil lconclude therefore with a brief d iscuss ionof de ict ica l ly -evoked discourse entit iesand the problem of descr ib ing themappropriately.The example comes from the chi ldren'sbook Babar Loses his Crown by Laurent deBrunhoff,  and involves the fol lowingsituation: Babar, King of the Elephants,decides to take his wife Celeste and hisfamily on a trip to Paris.
In packing forthe trip"Babar puts his crown in a l itt lered bag."
(p.3)They travel by train and then by taxi totheir hotel in Paris, and when they arrive"Celeste opens all the bags.
Lastof all, she opens the l itt le redone.
'Look!'
she cries.
'What isthis?
A flute!
Babar!
This is notyour bag!'
" (p.l~)Before this point in the story, thereshould have been one l itt le red bag inDM L. Now there should be two.
The firstis the ex is tent ia l ly -evoked discourseentity (say, e43 ) - "the l itt le red bagmentioned in sentence <x> that Babar puthis crown in".
However if "this" onpage 10 is not that entity, then it mustbe some other one (say, e~8) ~ How shouldit be descr ibed?
Since "thlS presumablypoints to the l itt le red bag Celeste isopening, e48 can appropr iate ly  bedescr ibed as "the just -ment ioned l itt lered bag which Celeste is opening, whichcontains a flute and not Babar's crown,and which is not equivalent  to e43".
<'15>The problem here is to be able toa r t i cu la te  c lear ly what each of thesepropert ies  derives from since they do notcome from a single sentence.
In thiscase, one must determine what thingsrelevant to the story do or do not fol lowfrom e48's not being Babar's bag.
* * * * * * * *In this paper, I have tried in asbrief a way as possible to reveal anaspect of understanding def inite anaphorathat precedes the more frequent lyd iscussed problem of "anaphor resolut ion".This aspect involves account ing for whatit is that def in ite anaphors refer to andhow such things become avai lable.
I movedfrom the notion of reference into a modelto problems of how that model issynthesized, and in part icular ,  how theentit ies in it are appropr iate lydescribed.
In this endeavor, I focused onthe initial descr ipt ions (IDs) ascribed toex is tent ia l ly -evoked entit ies, br ief lytouching upon de ict ica l ly -evoked entit iesas well.
This paper has just skimmed thesurface of a very large problem.
Inpart icular,  one must stil l  account for,inter alia, reference to actions, events,processes,  stuff, quant i t ies of stuff,etc.

Throughout this approach, I ammaking no assumptions about theseparateness of d iscourse entit ies.
Thatis, I am not assuming that two discourseentit ies are necessar i ly  and for all t imesdist inct,  unless it is speci f iedexpl ic i t ly  as was done here.
Twodiscourse entit ies may have incompatibledescr ipt ions and as a consequence beassumed to be dist inct.
But I do not v iewit as impossible for two separate ly  evokeddiscourse entit ies with d i f ferent  butcompatible descr ipt ions to later be foundto be one and the same.49Church, A.
