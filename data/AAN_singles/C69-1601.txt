Mater~lsThe mater ia l s  used for the present  cont r ibut ion  be long  totwo  groups :r Group A : texts wr i t ten  by f rancophones  w i th  ca.

These texts represent  whatwe cal l  Francophone Wr i t ten  Dutch  (below FWD).- g roup  B : Texts from recent  contemporary  Dutch  l i te ra tureby both  Dutch  and F lemish  authors .
They w i l lhere represent  Standard  Wr i t ten  Dutch  (SWD).==============================================================(~ We are great ly  indebted  for the ass i s tance  of oul co l -leages Mr .L .DE  BUSSCHERE,  who prepared  al l  computer  programsneeded in this invest igat fon ,  Mr .R .EECKHOUT,  who he lped uswith many suggest ions  as to the poss ib i l i t ies  of in fo rmat ionprocess ing  techn iques  and with c r i t i ca l  remarks  concern ingthe l ingu is t i c  aspects  of our prob lem,  and - last but notleast - the D i rec t ion  of the MATHEMATICAL  CENTRE of the Uni -vers i ty  of Louvain ,  who put at our d i sposa l  the IBM-360 com-puter.tkThe texts of group A were  wr i t ten  by 400 f rancophone 18 year-old pup i l s  in the h ighest  c lasses  at the 61 pr ivate  secundaryschoo ls  in Brusse ls  and its suburbs.
This sample representsone f i f th  of the total popu la t ion .
From every pupi l  we obta inedtwo Dutch  compos i t ions ,  one of them a p iece of homework  wr i t tenin November  \]967, another  an examinat ion  compos i t ion  f romDecember  of the same year.
The reasons  for this choice areev ident ,  s ince the pup i l s  can cal l  in their  parents '  and thei rd ic t ionar ies '  ass i s tance  in the f i rst  s i tuat ion  but not in thesecond.From every  compos i t ion  the f i rst  125 words  were  put on punch-cards together  w i th  coded in format ion  as to their  source.
Inthis way  a corpus  of ca.
100,000 words  was  compi led .
In orderto a l low for compar i son  of re la t ive  parameters  such as word-spread,  vocabu lary -growth  etc.,  it was later d iv ided  into twoparts  each conta in ing  ca.
50 ,000 words  (parts I and 2 be low) .The texts of group B, i.e.
the SWD, were  obta ined  by put t ingtogether  ext racts  from l i terary  work  by I0 contemporary  authors .This antho logy  gave us a corpus of some \]O,0OO words .The f i rst  part  of group A re f lec ts  ca.
50 d i f fe rent  sub ject -mat ters ,  whereas  the SWD-antho logy  re f lects  only \]O sub ject -mat ters  or " themes" .
So the d ispropor t ion  of corpora  is out-we ighed by a themes/tokens rat io  wh ich  is I/ 10 in both  corpora .In order  to es t imate  the in f luence  of sub jec t -mat ter  on word-cho ice  and espec ia l ly  on the rate of vocabu lary -growth ,  a com-par i son  was made between the |O-author -corpus  and a f ragment  ofca.
10,0OO words  f rom one s ing le  author.
The resu l ts  show thatthe vocabu lary -growth  remains  a lmost  unchanged,  i.e.
that thed ivers i ty  of sub jec t -mat ters  does not substant ia l l y  in f luencethe numer ica l  va lues  of g rowth  rate (fig.

In accordance  w i ththis resu l t ,  we suggested  that each of these texts (groups Aand B) be regarded as wr i t ten  by one s ingle person.i~az~/i Ji jI ~  j ?COMPARISON OFVOCABULARY GROWTH10 themes:I theme : oFiG.
I2 Lexical ~ter~renceThe main purpose of this cont r ibut ion  is to test and ver i fycerta in non-computat iona l  ins ights made about language inter-ference in general .
Dutch presents  a very po ignant  example ofthis phenomenon since its vocabu lary  conta ins  a very largenumber of French loan- and fore ign words and there is st i l lan "open door" a l lowing  the int rus ion  of lexieal  ga l l i c i sm inpract ica l ly  un l imi ted quant i ty .
Thus the Dutch vocabu laryholds a lot of para l le l  lexemes of both  or ig ins,  e.g.
analyse~ontleding, fenomeen/verschijnsel, decep~ie/ontgoocheling etc.This s i tuat ion  st rongly  resembles  that of Eng l i sh  wi th  itsAng lo -Saxon  and Romance words,  a l though the semant ic  d i f fer -ent ia t ion  of such word-pa l rs  seems to have progressed  muchmore there.
Whereas the nat ive  Dutch speaker  plays both keysw i th  an unb iased ease, for the Be lg ian  f rancophone this ambig-uous s i tuat ion  produces  cer ta in  const ra in ts  and d i f f i cu l t ies ,wh ich  have v is ib le  ef fects  on word-cho ice ,  growth rate offo re ign  words  and vocabu lary  size in general .For reasons of s impl i c i ty  our invest igat ion  did not adopt theusual  d i s t inc t ion  between loan-words  and fore ign words  sincethis is based on the d i f fe rent  degrees  of in tegrat ion  offore ign lexemes,  measured  by d i f fe rences  in p ronunc ia t ion ,social  acceptab i l i ty  w i th in  the speak ing communi ty  and cer ta inprescr ip t ive  a r rangements  such as their inc lus ion  in vocabu la -ries and d ic t ionar ies ,  whose author i ty  is genera l ly  accepted.As the aim of our invest igat ion  was to find ways of p rov id ingnumer ica l  va lues for in ter fe rence  phenomena,  we proceeded ina pure ly  descr ip t ive  way, using only e tymolog ica l  c r i te r ia  tod i s t ingu ish  between or ig ina l  and fore ign lexical  e lements .Thus we cons idered  units conta in ing  e i ther  lexical  or morpho-logical  e lements ,  or both,  as loan-words.
So bonjouPen withits French lexical  e lement  was entered,  but also trotser#nbecause  of its French word- f romat iona l  part.
Compos i ta  conta i -n ing only one fore ign e lement  (e.g.
avondto~let) were treated asloan-words  unless this e lement  had a l ready been entered as anautonomous  word.
No d i s t inc t ion  was made between fore ign wordsinc luded in the Standard Dutch Vocabu lary  of van Dale ,(e.g.assaut) amd those wh ich  are not ment ioned  there (e,g.auberge),both examples  occur r ing  in our invest igat ion  mater ia ls .
S incethe computer  p rogram did not prov ide for lemma- l ike  items, alld i f fe rent  morpho log ica l  forms and der ivat ions  of words  wereregarded  as d i f fe rent  types; thus expresoie, expressief, ex-pressionlst etc.
are counted as d i f fe rent  items.
Also forreasons of s impl ic i ty  all non-French  fore ign  words  are re le-gated here to the category  of pure Dutch items.3.
Lexical mter~renceand word-~ngthAs a f irst  approx imat ion  test the percentage  of fo re ign  wordsin the vocabu lary  in both  FWD- and SWD-texts  was es tab l i shed .The resul ts  are as fo l lows :TOKENS TYPES ZogTYPESFWD 47,307 5,653 0.8375SWD 10,358 2,616 0.8807FOREIGN TYP ~ogF.T.648 0 .4954% F.TYPES~11.85141 O.4285 5.38The d i f fe rence  of fore ign vocabu lary  rat io in both  groupsresul ts  in d i s t r ibut iona l  d i f fe rences  of words  of d iverg ingle t ter -number .
Though the overal l  word - length  of tokens inboth  groups is near ly  ident ica l  (4.5\] for SWD and 4.61 for FWD)en  app l i ca t ion  of the ch i - square  test proved the d ivergencesof word d i s t r ibut ion  (words be long ing  to d i f fe rent  word-c lasses) to be h igh ly  s ign i f i cant .
The average word- length  oftypes (M) is d i f fe rent  in both  groups :FWDSWDM o7.85  2 .977 .03 2.72As the pronunc ia t ion  of F rench words is in most cases adaptedto the Dutch ones (and this is re f lected  in the or thography) ,it was not p laus ib le  to suppose that this d ivergence  was duenoly to the propor t iona l  d i f fe rence  of fore ign words.
It wasfound that the d ivergence  was part ly  due tO the use of eompos i tain FWD; their d i s t r ibut ion  d i f fers  cons iderab ly  from SWD.
Thisis str ikingly evident for word- length |0 (fig.2) The fact thatFWD-authors Would "switch in" this Dutch-formational  device incases where the Dutch native speaker does not, shows that fran-cophones are "over-aware" of this means of translat ing theFrench genitive construct ion by a Dutch compositum (e.g.
pot de~eu~8> b loempot ) .
This fact strengthens the assumption made inthis paper, that the lexieal level of language is very closelyconnected with higher (syntactic) levels, so that stat ist ical lystatable facts may be explained only in connection with certainmore general models of speech production.?

An interference modelThe in ter fe rence  model  p resented  here cons is ts  of two parts  :the syntact ic  one, conta in ing  also the word- fo rmat iona l  dev ices ,wh ich  may be thought  of as a generat ive  dev ice  o f  the k inddescr ibed  by N .CHOMSKY and other generat iv i s ts ;  the second part ,ca l led the lexical morpheme store, is thought  of as cons is t ingof entr ies  "wr i t ten  down" in terms of conceptua l  symbols ,  pro-v ided w i th  actual  l ingu is t i c  in terpretat ions .
These " in terpreta -t ions",  wh ich  in a very  s impl i f ied  manner  may be ident i f ied  w i thwords  tout court, are p icked out of the store and " f i t ted"  intoprev ious ly  const ructed  sentence forms.
In other words ,  we assumethat the sentences  are formed accord ing  to semant ic  requ i rementsbefore  the actual  words  have been chosen.
This last rout ine  goeson in a semi -automat ic  way,  wh ich  may be v i sua l i zed  as p ick ingthe requ i red  lexemes - accord ing  to the entr ies  in terms ofconceptua l  symbols  - out of a magnet ic  tape g l id ing  under  aread ing dev ice  of some sort.For the case of a b i l ingua l  speaker ,  we can imagine the procedureas a tape w i th  three d i f fe rent  tracks,  the midd le  one conta in -~ng the "ent r ies"  , the other two the respect ive  actua l  morphemes,in casu Dutch and French  (D and F in fig.
3).
Speak ing  in one ofthe two languages  demands a sw i tch -over  to one of the externa ltracks.
It may be assumed that, in the case of a mono l ingua lDutch speaker ,  the cel ls  conta in  the para l le l  F rench  and Dutchwords  in an unordered  manner ,  whereas  w i th  a f rancophone a b iasex ists  towards the F rench  loan-word  (e.g.
co lumn \] on f ig .3 :ph~nom?ne > fenomeen (verschijnsel)).
This exp la ins  the pred i -lec t ion  for loan-words  even w i th in  the l imits  of the "basic  voca-bu lary"  and the more so w i th  words  of low f requency .
Other  var iantsof speech product ion  behav ior  are poss ib le ;  for ins tance  the hyper -cor rect  opt ion  \] ~ 1 in co lumn 2, where  the speaker  consc ious lyreaches  for the more  d is tant  lexeme, and the case of pure bor row-ing, wh ich  may be conce ived of as an automat ic  sw i tch -over  tothe F rench  side, wherever  the Dutch track is b lank  or wheneverthe b i l ingua l ' s  competence  fai ls to furn ish a good Dutch wordor synonym.
In this process  the French lexeme is p laced in thecell  on the Dutch side (c f .co lumn 3 where  ~ is the lacking word) .1 2 3 4D i ' ve.chi/nsel ~ 1 on,lo~'ing.--.,..-2 fenomeen J 2 analyseii ' *ClPH ENOMENONS* " CANALYSISm ~ I - ->2 ~.

3I EngelsIBrTts I2 ~anisch=BRITISH ~optm I'-->2I I. BRITANN/QUE<We assume that the word- fo rmat iona l  rules be long  to the syn-tact ica l  part.
Thus the reshap ing  of new French bor rowings(cf.
the loan-ad jec t ive  gebagancerd  composed of the Frenchbagan~ , whose counterpar t  is lack ing in the Dutch track,and of two Dutch af f ixes  ge- and -d) is done in the grammat i -cal part  of our model .
As a matter  of fact, this assumpt ionis a heur i s t i c  over -s imp l i f i ca t ion ,  because  cer ta in  grammat i -cal morphemes  are in fact borrowed,  cf.
the endings -eren,-at~e, -age etc.
In order to exp la in  this phenomenon,  onecould argue on the fact that in many cases whole  word - i temsare in t roduced  to the lexical  store and act ivate the ana logymechan ism,  but this p rob lem wou ld  lead us beyond the scopeof the present  invest igat ion .A code-swit~ing th~ryThere has been  much specu la t ion  about the poss ib le  p r inc ip leof lexeme order in the store, some order ing  be ing  a necessarycond i t ion  of e f f i c ient  re -cod ing.
Much d iscuss ion ,  too, has8been devoted to the so-ca l led Z IPF- Iaw 3) .
The most  conv inc ingexp lanat ion  was that suggested by HERDAN 4), namely  that an order -ing of items by decreas ing  f requency wou ld  d imin ish  the numberof operat ions  necessary  to ident i f ie  a g iven item.
"Let us ...assume that the arrangement of the entries is systematic accord-ing to frequency of occurence in descending order of frequency,so that the most frequent word has rank I, the second most fre-quent word rank 2, and so on.
If in such a dictionary, that isone in which words are arranged in order of decreasing frequencyand increasing order of rankj the look-up procedure is one ofsuccessive comparison, the word of rank r will require r look-upoperations~ and since this word occurs - the Zipf-law assumed -C/r times, the total number of look-up operations required tolocate a word is C (the constant in the Zipf-law, formulated asr.fr= C ).
Thus for n words contained in the dictionary, nClook-up operations will be required.
On the other hand, we knowthat for the Zipf-law the total number of occurences (the textlength in terms of word number) and thus the total number ofwords to be searched, is given byI~Crdr = C lo~ n NIt follows that the average number of look-up operations perword isAn= nC/C lo~ n = n/ lo~ n(...) This compares favourably with the n/2 look-up operationswhich would be needed under the scheme described above, whichmakes no use of the frequency element."
)With in  the f ramework of our model  it wou ld  mean that the w ind-ing and unwind ing  of the tape takes cons iderab ly  less time t~a~Lin the case of who l ly  random d is t r ibut ion .
The quest ion  remainsof what pr inc ip le  under l ies  the d i f fe rent ia t ion  of i tem poss i -b i l i ty .
Here too, the concept  of "p igeon-ho l ing"  o~ semant icin fo rmat ion  proposed by HERDAN 4)  seems to be the most  p laus ib le .In other words,  the "conceptua l  symbols"  do not representseparate p ieces of the univers de disoour8 taken at random,but are probab ly  ordered by some c lass i f i ca t iona l  system,resembl ing  the b io log ica l  c lass i f i ca t ion .6.
Word content and entropyTo test this hypothes is  we d iv ided the FWD mater ia l  intothree f requency-c lasses  (group I: abso lute  f requency  \],group II: f requency  2 and 3, group III : f requency  above3) and examined the samples of these groups accord ing  totheir  d i s t r ibut ion  w i th in  the c lass i f i ca t iona l  systemappl ied  by L .BROUWERS in his Dutch thesaurus  HET JUISTEWOORD 3).
The suppos i t ion  was that in the event of o rder ingof some kind, the d i s t r ibut ion  of items among the "contentc lasses"  in the thesaurus (expressed as entropy and redun-dancy) would  be d i f fe rent  for var ious  f requency  groups, andfur ther ,  that in the event of the "p igeon-ho l ing"  suggestedby HERDAN, the redundancy  should increase for groups of itemsw i th  h igher  f requenc ies .
Such an increase was in fact obser-ved, as the reader  can conc lude from the fo l low ing  table:FREQUENCY 1H 5.099R 0.15FREQUENCY 2-3 FREQUENCY ?
34.892 4.8540.18 0.19Thus it seems that some "natural  order",  re f lec t ing  a c lass i -f i ca t ion  of concepts  accord ing  to their content ,  is at leastone of the causes d i f fe rent ia t ing  the, re lat ive f requenc ies  ofwords .
This resu l t  is compat ib le  wi th  the fact that thed ivers i ty  of sub jec t -mat ter  (cf.\]) does not cons iderab lya l ter  the growth rate of vocabu lary .
This s tatement  need not/o/'/~/,,,~f/ .Itrule out other devices a l lowing  quick in terconnect ionsbetween words  be long ing  to the same content -group  butd i f fe r ing  in f requency;  (cf.
the so-ca l led association ofrelated concepts suggested by P .A .KOLERS @).
However,  thebas ic  p r inc ip le  of order seems to be of a s tat i s t i ca l  kind,as is proved by the per fect  fit of the rank- f requencyd i s t r ibut ion  w i th  the theoret ica l  d i s t r ibut ion  accord ingto the Z IPF -MANDELBROT fo rmulat ion  (of .

The corre-lat ion coef f i c ient  between the observed and the theoret ica ld i s t r ibut ion  is 0.993!Z ConsequencesThe assumed model  has lconsequences ,  wh ich  have been  empir i -ca l ly  tested:I.
The assumed model ,  and espec ia l l y  the process of bZank-fiZl?ng of the Dutch track w i th  French morphemes,  p resuppo-ses that in genera l  the FWD-wr i te rs  wi l l  use a greater  numberof fo re ign  words  than the SWD al lows.
This fact is a l readyapparent  f rom the overal l  percentage  of fore ign e lements  inFWD (cf.
f ig.5) In par t i cu la r  the fore ign words  should appearmore f requent ly  in p ropor t ion  to the increase of text - length  ) .The invest igat ion  of vocabu lary  growth rate has in factshown that this is the case : the rat io of new fore ign wordsto the total vocabu lary  remains stable (ca.

Thereaf te r  it increasesconsiderably.
The sample descr ibed  as Part  2(fig.

no o r thograph ic  mistakes  or ommiss ions  have been el imi-nated,  as it was done manua l ly  in Part I.
Thus all o r thogra-phic id iosyncras ies  have been counted as new types by thecomputer .
We assume that the d i f fe rence  in the size of theso -ca l led  bas ic  vocabu lary  (3,000 -- 3,500) is main ly  due tothis fact.t2t,J/1J~  (.n\\, ~ , \13L2.
As the choice of lexemes from the store takes place interms of "conceptua l  symbols",  the lexical  d ivers i ty  shouldnot be substant ia l l y  d imin ished on account  of the l imitedvocabu lary .
The b lank- f i l l i ngs  wi th  French lexemes shouldal low the f rancophones  to keep the overal l  d ivers i ty  on anormal  level, i.e.
on that of the SWD-wr i ters .
In otherwords ,  we suppose that the greater  number of fore ign e lementsin FWD-texts  is the consequence  of the endeavor  to "keep inpace" w i th  the normal  rate of language d ivers i ty .CONCLUSIONSa) The f rancophone b i l ingua ls  use more than twice as muchwords  as the mono l ingua l  nat ive speakers of Dutch.b) This fact is connected wi th  the tendency to keep theoveral l  var ie ty  of vocabu lary  at a certa in  "normal"level of speech product ion .
This var ie ty  is a bitsmal ler  than in the case of nat ive speakers  (cf.
ther lo~ee_~ rat io =log N ; for FWD 0.837, for SWD 0.880).c) It can never the less  be descr ibed as "normal"  since thevalue of parameter  B in MANDELBROT's  fo rmulat ion  of theZ IPF - Iaw is \].03347.d) The fore ign lexemes are not equ id i s t r ibuted  in theassumed word store; their number increases wi th  thegrowing  text length and this increase is quite ev identabove the f irst  3,000 words,  This fact a l lows one tothink of them as a "basic vocabu lary" ,  cover ing var ioussubjects  (two d i f fe rent  mul t i - sub jec t  samples gavenear ly  ident ica l  va lues of the basic vocabu lary) .e) The ex is tence of the bas ic  vocabu lary  and the good fitof empir ica l  data wi th  the theoret ica l  d i s t r ibut ionknown as ZIPF- Iaw,  s t rengthens  the assumpt ion  that theword-un i t s  in the store are ordered.f) One of ?he order ing  pr inc ip les  is the p igeon-ho l ing  ofin fo rmat ion  accord ing  to some c lass i f i ca t iona l  systemwh ich  takes into account  the in fo rmat iona l  content  ofwords .~4REFERENCESi.
