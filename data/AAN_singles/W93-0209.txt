I n t roduct ionThis essay describes experiences made in connection with tile consultation system WISBER \[llo-racek et al 1988\] and with the expla.nation device DIAMOD \[Horacek 1993a\], featuring tile roleof intentions in the former and the role of rhetoric in the latter.
Assessing the results obtained,we clarify our standpoint concerning the workshop topic, emphasizing on future prospects for text.planning.2.
Ti le role of intent ions in discourse p lann ingIn sinmlating a consultant's role, a central capahility of WISBER is reasoning about the eonversants'intentions to determine a communicative action that is likely to achieve progress towards a long-term consultation goal \[Gerlach, Horacek 1989\].
The mental model of tile agents involved consistsof BEI, IEFs, KNOWs, aud WANTs, which are expressed as I)rimitive, time-dependent states.
Anagent's INTENTION is defined as a WANT to achieve a state, including a BELIEF that performinga certain action will lead to that state.
A rule-hased mechanism is invoked to mai,tain consistencyby updating tile temporal validity of these mental states, to infer a communicative system goal, andto associate appropriate speech acts with that goal (this association is made more profound by arule- based mechanism in Cohen and Levesque's style \[Horacek 1991b\]).Evidence about relations between several WANTs derived from subsequent utterances i kept \[tIo-racek, Gerlach 1990\].
The contextual interpretation of these relations is done on the basis of CA-PABII, ITIES and COMPETENC, ES ascribed to the agents involved, augmented by the actual POS-SIBII,ITY to carry out the actions referred.
This way, intentions are related via their contents(one is a PAR'F of another ,  or one is the REASON for another).
In a more elahorate model ofconsultatio.
\[lIoracek 1990@ a.  agent's evaluations are expressed in terms of ESTIMA'FES and(derived) PREFERENCES.
These assessments may refer to general and vague concepts introducedin the dialog context, which the consultant has to relate meaningfully to the concrete properties ofthe candidate domain objects.31The system typically produces one- or two-clause dialog contributions composed in a two-stagelexicalization process \[Horacek 1990b\] which respect the addressee's command of terminologicalknowledge and reflect simple stylistic preferences.
Only when producing a recommendation, thesurface realization structurally differs from the intentional representation, so that rhetorical as-pects are really a concern.
In this case, the consultant's intention comprises the identification of arecommendable object, and the description of a property considered most interesting for the advice-seeking person.
The surface form consists of two separate sentences erving these purposes in theindicated order.
Because of that order, interpretations that the property is meant to be restrictiveor a motivation or justification for the choice made are excluded, and the fact that only one prop-erty is mentioned carries the message about its importance - the environment is cooperative, notmentioning other properties must be on purpose.3.
App ly ing  rhetor ica l  means  to communicate  more  complex  messages adequate lyIn producing explanations about an expert system's problem solving behavior, we concentrate oureffort on generating logical explanations.
For this issue, det.erntil~ation f semantic ontent provesto be a complex task, guided by finding and exploiting dominances and redundancies among po-tentially useful argulnents \[Horacek 1992b\].
The resulting argumentative structure is converted intoa text plan in a structure-preserving way \[Horacek 1992a\].
For instance, hierarchical relations aremaintained so that an argumentative pattern consisting of a justification breaking down into sub-arguments i carried over to the text structure.
For increasing readability, the text is augmentedby a.n itd, roductory statement about (.he structure of the message and by a summary, llowcver, themotivation for tho a.i)plication of these tneasurements still has to be cal)tured in a formal way.Moreover, we have designed a mechanism that aims a.t exploiting the addressee's inference capabilityfor avoiding (boring) redundancies, by anticipating his/her coruprehension process in the generationtask.
This procedure is justified by the observation that (the relevance of) generic regularities canbe inferred from referential facts and vice-versa, due to the expected relevance attributed to infor-mation conveyed in a cooperative, task-oriented enviromnent.
Assumptions about the addressee'sacquaintance with domain knowledge have significant influence on anticipating his/her inferences.In addition, psychologically motivated principles (like maximal coverage and minimal complexity)guide preferences among possible interpretations \[Iloracek 1992c\].
tlence, only some ccntral pieccsof information eed to be said explicitly for getting the entire message across.4.
Future  prospects  for text  p lann ingWe think that these considerations provide sufficient evidence for the roles of intentions and rhetoricin discourse.
Intentions drive internal goal-oriented reasoning about mental models of agents andmanifest hemselves in terms of l)lans adopted and actions carried out, independently of whethercommunication is involved or not.
Intentions address envisioning physical or mental states relatedamong each other in a way described in section 2.
Rhetoric manifests itself in the differences between(rei)resentations of) mental states and the variety of surface forms used to satisfy the underlyinggoals by adequate l)resentations.
These measurenaents include structuring and ordering pieces oftext, applying rhetorical figures, and taking consequences of the Gricean maxims into account (forinstance, conveying a piece of information or not is on purpose).in our view, relations between rhetoric and intentions are described well in (classical) literary rhetoric32which, therefore, should also guide adequate formalizations.
In that approach, intentions comprisea pure semantic ontent (the 'proprium') and an attitude holding towards it.
The art, of rhetoricis then to select forms that convey the intended attitude towards the 'proprium'.
In computationalapproaches, on the contrary, semantic, intentional, and textual relations are frequently treated ina uniform way, subsumed under tile term 'rhetorical relations', which makes organizating the textplanning process less clear.There are several prerequisites for orienting text planning on classical rhetoric.
A basic and generalvocabulary of semantic relations is needed (CAPABILITY, POSSIBILITY, COMPETENCE, andthe associated state-transition model constitute a first step towards that goal).
On tile basis of thesesemantic relations, relations between intentions can be defined, including formalizations of aspectsof cooperativity (a primary sketch can be found in \[tloracek 1991b\]).
In our view, this approachalso seems to be promising to develop formalizations for complex relations like SOLUTIONHOODand CONCESSION, on tile basis of the underlying facts and attitudes holding towards them.
More-over, tile associated reasoning process has to reflect degrees of graduality which characterize severalaspects in communication: an agent's assessments (e.g., ESTIMATE \[Horacek 1990a\]), his/her ac-quaintance with domain terms and concepts, and progress towards a long-term communicative goal.
'Fhe quantitative aspect is missing in compul.ational pl)roaches.When the employment of rhetorical figures is invoked to compose a text that is supposed to servea comnmnicative intention, the choices to make have to be oriented ou anticipating the addressee'scomprehensioll process in several respects:?
Making use of his/her inference capabilities, only parts of tile inforlnation to convey need tobe expressed explicitly (see \[noracek 1991a1, \[noracek 1992c\]).?
There is a trade-off between fluent expressions, which may entail anlbiguities, and precise ones,which may occasionally sound awkward?
\[Block, Horacek 1990\] argue in fervor of naturalness, if the resulting ambiguity is tolerable.?
Envisioning a reasonable degree of comprehension (see \[Horacek 1993b\]), tile amount of infor-mation communicated should not exceed a certain quantity, among others; this goal would alsoyield motivations for tile incorporation of purely textual relations like summaries and hintsabout the structure of a text..We, think that these argmnenl,s have ident, ificd a couple of problems in tile area of intentionality andrhetoric, but also some promising ways towards olutions.References\[Horacek et al 1988\] H. tloracek, It.
