The primary propertyis relation comparison: pairs of near-synonyntscan be COlnpared and judged as more, or less,similar to each other than others.
For example,there is something similar in the relationship be-tween stingy/frugal and between j'at/plump.
Ineach case, the first word (stingy, fat) is pejorativewhile the second (frugal, plump) has a nuance ofbeing admirable or attractive.
This relationshipwould not be maintained if, for example, we re-placed fat/plump by rotund/plump.Relat ion  express ions .

Chaflin and l lerrmannohserve that "the production and recognition of'relations is a creative abil ity", so that the relation between two words "can he readily iden-tified although the reader may never have con-sidered the relation of these particular terms be-tbre" \[p. 292\].
We wilt show tha, t relation ere-ativit 9 is equally necessary to a theory of near-synonymic relations, l'br example, the relation of2Chatf in and ' J le r r tnann  \[1988\] use the somewhat  mis leadingterln relation ambiguity, bug we bel ieve it is ntore accurate  andless confus ing to use the te rm relation complexi@.arrange/organize 3 can be recognized as one thatcontrasts correctness with functionality, and wemight then detect his same relationship for otherpairs of near-synonyms (e.g., trim/shave).In summing up the importance of these rela-tion properties to a theory of semantic relations,Chaffm and Herrmann state that "these diversephenomena must be explained by theories of re-lations" and "we will tind that in order to ex-plain relations it is necessary to assume that rela-tions are normally composed of more primitive l-ements that account for their characteristics andfor people's abilities to make judgments aboutthem" \[p. 292\].
We, believe these observations areequally true of theories of plesionymic relationsand we will show that a relation-element theoryof near-synonymy will account for these relationproperties.3.2 Theoretical assumptionsIn developing their theory of semantic rela-tions, Chaflin and Herrmann make the following)'e, presentationa l ssumptions \[paraphrased frompp.

Arow is angry and may involve shouting,usually tbr a short time .
.
.
A row canalso take place between public figures ororganizations.\[\['here are two ways we can construct he relationbetween quarrel and row, depending on whetherthe argument is between people or inanimate or-ganizations:quarrel/~vw:(Ibrceful, fbrlnalji, emotionalji(vectorialjl))quarrel/row:(forceful, \[nan\[mat ell (forlnalji))The tirst relation states that row is more formaland more emotional; quarrel is more forceflll.
Italso indicates that the greater emotion of a rowis linked to a difference in scale, the vectorial el-ement, which in this case refers to the diff>rentlengths of t ime of a quar~vl and a row.
The sec-ond relation notes that a row can inw)lve inan-intate entities but, if it does, then the effect ismore formal.
Thus, we can have different rela-tions between plesionyms, depending on the dif-ferent usages of the words.By following the same kind of approach, we can(:onstruct relations for some other pairs of near-synonyms:flvwn/,qrirnaee:(general (formalji, torcefn\]jl)mistake/blunder:(general (formalji, fornefi~lji, carelessji))fat/plump:(general (forcefifl (pol itqi(attractivej l))))We observe that the same or similar relation(:an hold between differentpairs of near-synonyms, for example, ask/beseech,thin/ernaeiated, and ffow~@rirnace.
This is mta.l-ogous to the case of semantic relations, which,as Chaffin and Herrmann note, are readily recog-nizable and nameable.
Near-synonymic relationscannot be so easily labelled, but we can still seethat some basic set of relations might be definedand could be used to construct new relations, l?k)rexample, we showed that the relation between askand beseech couhl be represented by the followingstructure:ask/beseech:(geuera\] (forxnal.ii, forcefulji))We saw how this basic relation could also applyto thin/emaciated and fl'own/grimace; this sug-.gests that,  lor lexical-choice processing, we willwant to keep a catalogue of existing relations fromwhich new relations could be built.
Another pairof near-synonyms, mistake and blunder, share thesame distinctions, except hat blunder is often theresult of carelessness (OALD).
So we add to theexisting specification to obtain the following rela-tion:re\[sick, c/blunder:(general (formal\[l, fo:rcefulj~, carelessji))Imstty, dependencies can lead to quite com-plicated relations, as iu the case of fat/plu'mp,where the distinction of politeness (intpoliteness)is related to different dependencies for each near-synonynu the nuances of force and impolitenessare interdependent, asare those of politeness anda.ttrantiveness.6 The  re la t ion  proper t iesIn Section 3.11, we set out a list of relation 1)roper-ties that any theory of i,ear-synonymic relationsshould be able to account lot'.
In tlhis section,we discuss how a relation-element approach ad-dresses these issues.Re la t ion  compar i son .
By breaking down therelations between ptesionyms into relation ele-ments, we can obtain a finer degree ot' discrim-ination between similar words for the task of lex-ical choice in generation.
As we discuss in \[l)i-Marco, \[first, and Stede 1993\], many of the se-mantic distinctions between plesionyms do not\]end themselvns to neat, taxonomic differentia-tion; ratlher, they are fuzzy, with plesionyms of-ten having an area of overlap.
For exa,mple, theboundary between forest and wood is vague, andthere are some situations it, which either wordmight be equally appropriate.
The i)roblem iscompounded when we are dealing with more thanone language, for the %veakpoint' between smalland large tracts of trees is different for differ-ent languages.
For multi l ingual generation, wecan compare plesionyms in different languages interms of their different elelnent structures, so thatit shouhl be easier to choose the particular wordiu a particular language that tits a given situation.Re la t ion  express ions .
We have seen thai; o\[:ten the distinctions between near-synonyms needto be expressed using common words and phrases.But we have shown that there are ways of ex-pressing relations using fairly common vocabu-lary to represent hese distinctions.
The ease ofrelation identilic,~tion may contribute towards re-lation veritication: we ('an anticipate that psycho-logical tests, of the soN, Chaffin and IIerrmanncarried out lbr semantic relations, could be usedto verify our relations and relation elements, as wecan meaningfidly and precisely represent the sub-jects' intuitions about the distinctions betweenn ear- syn onyms.694Re la t ion  complex i ty .
R,elations may need tobe de.scribed ~1; more= than one hwel of c<)ml)lex-ity, so that the dist inct ions between two wordsmay be identified in more than one way.

The first system that we al'e lookingat is WordNe(; \[Miller et al:1990), whi<;h s('emsp~rti(;uhtrly relew~nt as words are organized bothby semantic relations and by "synsets" (synonymsets).WordNet contains delinit ions of uomls, verbs,and adjectives; for now, we are COileeiitrooting on the reI>resenta,tion of adje(:tiwtl near-synonyms.
In keel)log with the l)hilosol)hy ofWordNet,  we envisage the use <)f a i)ointerfor each type (>\[" near-synonymic relation inour cal;alogue, so that we might tel)resentthe relations betwee.n plesionyms as follows:r l  : (genera\[ (favourableji))r2 : (general (fbl:tnaljl, forcefitl.ii))r3 :  (general (favon,'abh b forcefulji))Currently, the coding of a, synse.t of adjectiveswouhl look as lbllows in Word Net:{ thin,  slender, erase.fated, thin1, & }where " th in l ,  &" indicates that members of thissyltset are related to the '(:<)n(:e.l>t' th in /  I>y thesimila,rity relation.We can imagine iml)<)siug additional structureon a synset and malting use of a catah)gue of near-synonymic relations to obtain the f<)llowing cod-ing:{ \[thin, sh;nder, rl\],  \[thin, eros.elated, r21,\[shin<let, emaciated, r3\], thin1, & }s8In WordNet, square brackets are used to indicate a lexicalWhile such a representation of near synonymicrelations would be very easy and natura l  in Word.Net, it relies on the solution of a uunll)er of chahlenging probh~ms, speeili('ally, how to generate acomt>lete set of near-synonymic rehLtion elenl(utts,and how to define a constrained and reusa, ble cat-aJogue of nea.r- synonymic relations.8 Conc lus ionOur  evelltlla\] g()a,\[ is a knowledge representati,..>nh)r the <Iiscriminati(>ll of near-synonylns.
