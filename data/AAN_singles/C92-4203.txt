C, TM: An Exmnt)le-Based Translation Aid SystemSatoshi SATO *School of Information ScienceJapan Institute of Science and Technology, lqokurikuTat, stmokuehi, Ishikawa, 923 12, Japansato~jaist-east.ac.j pAbst rac tThis paper describes a Japanese-English translationaid system, C'I'M, which has a usefid capability forflexible retrieval of texts from hilingaal corpora ortranslation databases.
Translation examples (pairsof a text and its translation equivalent) are veryhelpful for us to translate the similar text.
Ourcharacter-based best match retrieval method can re:trieve translation examples imilar to the given input.This method has the following advantages: (1) thismethod accepts free-style translation examples, i.e.,pairs of any text string and its translation equiva-lent, (2) morphological analysis is unnecessary, (3)this method accepts fl'ce-Myle inlmts (i.e., any textstrings) for retrieval.
We show the retrieval exampleswith the following characteristic features: phrasal ex-pression, long-distance dependency, idiom, synonym,mad semantic ambiguity.1 In t roduct ionIn the late 1980's, several commercial Japanese-English machine translation systems had heen devel-oped in Japan, In these systems, the computer is theagent of translation, while the user assists in editingthe translation inputs and revising the results.
Al-though they are usefal to translate large amounts oftexts roughly and rapidly, high quality translation isimpossible.T rans la t ion  aM is another kind of machine trans-lation: the user is the agent of translation, while thecomputer provides him or her with the helpfifl tools,e.g., quick-retrieval electronic dictionaries.
A quick-retrieval bilingual corpus is also usefifl, specificallywhen it h,'~s the flexihle (best match) retrieval mech-anism.
Because translatiml examples (pairs of sourcetext, and its translation equivalent) are very helpfulfor us to translate the similar text.
This type of sys-tem is called a~ example-based translalion aid \[6\], andthere are two prototype systems in Japanese-Englishtranslation: ETOC \[8\] and Nakanmra's ystem \[5\].

It consists of two com-ponents: the t rans la t ion  database  is the collectionof translation examples, and the best  match  re-t r ieva l  engine is to retrieve the example that is themost similar to the given input text.
The character-istic of the EBTA system is that it accepts free-styletexl inputs for the retrieval: it frees the user fromlearning the tbrmal language for datah,~se query.
'l'he central problem in EBTA is the implementa-tion of the hest match retrieval.
Two methods wereproposed: one is the syntax-matching driven by gen-eralization rules in ETOC \[8\], and the other is Naka-nmra's method using content words \[5\].
They arethe word-based  best  match  re t r ieva l  methods 1,which need morphological analysis.This paper proposes the character -based  bestmatch  re t r ieva l  method,  specifically for Japanesetexts  Compared with the word-hased methods, thecharaeter-h~sed method has the following advantages:?

23-28, 19922 The  Character -Based  BestMatch  Ret r ieva l  Method2.1 Character i s t i cs  o f  Japanese  Wr i t -ten  TextsJapanese written texts have remarkable characteris-tics as follows.
'riley cannot he found in Europeanlanguages, i.e., English, French, and German.1.
The number of characters is very large.The numher of characters that are used ill text ismore than 7,000 in Japanese.
while it is less than ahundred in a European language.2.
Synouyms often have the same Kanji character.Japanese characters are divided into three types'.
Hi-ragana (83 characters), Katakana (86 characters),and Kanji.
A lt iragana or Katakana character ex-presses a sound,  and a Kanji character epresents asemantic primitive.
For example, tile Kanji character"~"  means "thinking", and it is used for construct-lug several words concerned with thinking: e.g., ,~(~(thinking)~ ",~, (consideration), ~,~'(deep think-ing), ~~Ta (think), ~\ [~TTa  (devise).3.
There is no delimiter between words.In l"uropean languages, the white space is the delim-iter for word separation.
In contrast, Japanese hasno explicit delimiter.
Therefore, the main part ofJapanese morphological analysis is to divide a textstring into words: it is not easy task a.These characteristics of Japanese suggest thecharacter -based  best  l l late| l ,  becanseI While the word-based method needs morphologi-cal analysis, the character-bmsed method does notneed it.2.
In order to retrieve synonyms the word-basedmethod needs a thesaurus.
In coutra.st, thecharacter-based method call retrieve some kind ofsynonyms withont a thesallrus, because synonynlsoften have tile same Kanji character in Japanese.2.2 The Character-Based Best MatchThe character-based best match can be determinedby defining the distance or similarity measure be-tween two strings.The simple measure of similarity hetween twostrings, A = alau...a~., H = btb2.
.
.by,  is the num-ber of the matching characters considering the char-acter order constraint.
It is not particularly goodaFor  example ,  a Jap&llese morphoh~gical  anMyMs pFOgl'&llldeveloped by Nyolt~ University fails to anMyze 3 ~ ,5 % ofSelll ellCeS.memsure, bat makes a convenient starting point.
Wedefine it as follows:s( i , j )  =0 i f i=ov j=os ( i -  l , j  l )+m( i , j ) ,  )max s(i l , j ) ,s ( i , j  1)i f ( l  _< i < x) A(1 <_j<y)1 if a~ = b 3m{i , j )  = 0 i fa ,~b jThis measure often produces the undesirable re-suits, because we ignore continuation of matchingcharacters.
For example, consider the followingstrings:A = I" I~R4~'?70 (solve the problem)f~ = t~a~ m 5 ,~ j~1ce~ Ltco(He solved the problem yesterday.
)(determine tile method for solving the problem)We want to be S(A,13) > ,9(A, F?
'), but the abovemeasure produces ,5'(A, B) < ,S'(A, B~).
To solve theproblem, we consider tile bonus for contimmns match-ing characters.
It can be done by modifying m( i , j )m the the above definition:,5'(A,,~) = s(x,:j)s( i , j )  =.s(i -- 1, j  1) + min(cm( i , j ) ,W)max s( i -  l , j ) ,s( i , j  - 1)if(l < i< ~)A(1 _<j _< y)~,,~(/, j) =0 i f i=OVj=Oem(i  l , j  - 1) + m(i , j )if(1 _< i _< x)^(~ _<j <:/)1 if ai = bjm(i , j )  = 0 i fa i~b jThis is the similarity score that we use, where W is aparameter that determines the max imum value of thebonus for tile continuons matching characters.
When14" = 1, this definition is the same with tile previousdefinition.
Table l shows ,5'(A, B) and S(A, B') withvarying vahws of W. l_lsually we use W = 4.
