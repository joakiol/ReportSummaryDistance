IntroductionNetOwl TM Server is a powerful text analysissoftware product developed by IsoQuest, Inc. Itsupports business intelligence by providing fast andeasy access to information stored on local Intranetsand the global Internet.
It organizes, analyzes, andsummarizes data extracted by NameTag TM and anyFull-Text search engine.
It then presents the data foreither searching or browsing.
NameTag is a dataextraction and indexing tool that finds proper namesand other defined entities within an input text stream.NetOwl is the total application built on the NameTagcore engine.
NetOwl tags each desired ocument orWeb page by person, organization, location,relationship and description giving you a browsable"back-of-the-book index.'"
This allows for targetingexactly key information that is sought.
With NetOwlit is no longer necessary to scroll through massiveamounts of text to find exacdy what is useful.2.
Search FunctionalityNetOwl is a server-based program which generatesstandard CGI commands that can be executed by anystandard Web browser.
NetOwl's Loader ingestsdocuments from any text or HTML-based data source,sequentially loads the documents, then passes themon to NameTag and the full-text search engine for dataextraction.
The full-text search engine data is stored ina proprietary database while NameTag's exlracted atais stored in any ODBC-compliant database.There are two major functional areas of the NetOwlsystem.
The NetOwl Server system consists off?
Loader?
Full-Text Search?
NameTag?
Database interface?
ClientThe second NetOwl functional area comprisescustomization, maintenance and monitoring toolswhich provide support o the underlying processes ofNetOwl:?
NetOwl Administrator Tool?
NetOwl Service ManagerBoth major areas use the relational database forinformation storage and retrieval.
This is the onlylink to each of the functional areas (i.e., all commoninformation is accessed from the central database).The major functional areas never talk direcdy to eachother or require or pass information between eachother.LoaderThe Loader component of the NetOwl server collectsinformation to process (by crawling specified sites,USENET news groups and/or locally accessible files)and then creates an index of that data in the NetOwldatabase.Full-Text SearchThis Full-Text Search (P-TS) component accepts textdocuments from the loader and creates an index of allrelevant words.
The index thus created can later besearched by the client component to provide a list ofrelevant documents given a set of keywords.DatabaseThe Database component s ores the index informationgenerated by the Loader/NameTag combination.
Thedatabase is a relational database linking instances ofnames to relationships, descriptions, aliases, ",roddocuments.
NetOwl does not supply the database.
Itdoes, however, supply the interface to a databasethrough an ODBC layer so that any RDBMS systemcan be used (e.g., Access, SQL Server, Oracle,FoxPro, Informix, Sybase).ClientThe term "client" refers to the user interface you willuse to browse NetOwl's visual index, displaysummary information, and access information that ismost salient.
The client component is either a CGI-15compliant program or an HTFP server extensionwhich accepts requests transmitted from your WWWbrowser and returns an HTML page with the resultsof the request.
The client is the vehicle used to accessindex information in the database.The GUI interface provides you with direct access intothe NetOwl screens where you can design, submit,save, load and delete queries.
It then communicatesthese queries to the database components and presentsyou with the full document text along with a glossaryof the names, descriptions, relationships and wordsfound by NameTag and the fiTS engine.NameTagNameTag represents the key technology behindNetOwl's indexing ability.
NameTag is a dataextraction engine that identifies and interprets keyelements of free text, particularly names of people,organizations and locations.
For each document itreads, NameTag builds a signature that includes eachname or concept, where it's found in the document,and how it's interpreted.
For example, "Wa,~ington"can be a city, state, last name, or part of a companyname, depending on the context.
"Sun" can be a lastname, one of several companies, or a celestial object.NameTag identifies these pieces of information, helpsto interpret hem and eliminate the ambiguity,pulls in associated information such as tickersymbols for companies and variations of personnames.
The technology behind NameTag itself is acombination of a powerful pattern-matching techniqueknown as finite state interpretation with a carefully-designed knowledge base.3.
