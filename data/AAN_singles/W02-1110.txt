The development costs of such dataare a major drawback in such NLP systems.In order to cut these costs, we adopt astrategy inspired from "open-source"projects to allow volunteers to collaboratein the creation of a multilingual lexicaldatabase.For this, we had to specify and developtools to manage a lexical databasecontaining information complete anddetailed enough to be usable for a widerange of applications.This paper presents our project and detailsthe tools, frameworks and structures usedto manage such a database.
We will alsoshow some research problems still to beaddressed in this context.R?sum?La connaissance linguistique reste uneconstituante importante de nombreuxsyst?mes de traitement automatique deslangues (TAL).
Le co?t de cr?ation d?undictionnaire est l?un des freins majeursdans le d?veloppement de ces syst?mes.Afin de r?duire les co?ts de cr?ation decette connaissance lexicale, nous adoptonsune m?thode inspir?e des projets"open-source" afin de cr?er une baselexicale multilingue.Pour cela, nous avons sp?cifi?
etd?velopp?
des outils de gestion d'une baselexicale contenant des informationssuffisamment compl?tes et d?taill?es pour?tres utilis?es dans de nombreusesapplications diff?rentes.Cet article pr?sente notre projet et d?tailleles outils, les cadres et les structuresutilis?es pour la gestion de cette base.Nous montrons aussi certains probl?mesde recherche ouverts qu'il nous fautaborder dans ce contexte.IntroductionMany NLP systems are based on lexical data.The development costs of such data are a majordrawback in such NLP systems.
Furthermore, theexisting lexical data have generally beendeveloped for a specific purpose and can?t bereused easily in other applications.The Papillon project applies some tools andmethods to develop multipurpose, multilinguallexical data collaboratively on Internet.
This datais complete and detailed enough to be eventuallyused either by NLP systems (MT engines forexample) or by human users (language learners,translators?
).After presenting the motivations of the Papillonproject, we will show the management of existingdata.
Then we will describe the structure of thePapillon dictionary, and the tools that are used toallow contributions from Internet volunteers.1 The Papillon Project1.1 MotivationsThe Papillon project is the result of the gatheringof different people sharing common problemsand solutions.1.1.1 A Lack of ResourcesOn the Internet, a lot of free dictionaries areavailable but very few of them imply more than 2languages.
Most of these dictionaries includeEnglish as one of their languages.Furthermore, the existing dictionaries often lackinformation essential for beginners or NLPsystems.Another point contributing to this lack: the highcosts of development of large lexical resourcesfor NLP involves also a high price, dissuasive forthe end-user.1.1.2 Existing Structures and Tools forMultilingual DictionariesSome partners of the Papillon project have beeninvolved in research on the definition ofstructures and tools to handle multilingual lexicaldatabases.They were looking for an opportunity to applytheir research results on real scale lexical data.1.1.3 Collaborative Development on theInternetMost partners were participating, as computerscientists, in the development of open sourceproducts.
With the democratisation of Internetaccess in a lot of countries, came the opportunityto apply the open source principles to thedevelopment of a multipurpose, multilinguallexical database.Cooperation projects for bilingual dictionariesare already going on such as EDICT, aJapanese-English dictionary lead by Jim Breen(2001) for more than 10 years and more recently,SAIKAM, a Japanese-Thai dictionary (seeAmpornaramveth (2000)).With the Papillon project, the dictionary isextended to a multilingual lexical database.Volunteers will find lexicons developed byothers and some tools to complete or correct thePapillon multilingual dictionary.
Users will alsobe able to define their own personal views of thedatabase.1.2 Dictionary Markup LanguageFrameworkMathieu Mangeot-Lerebours (2001) defines acomplete framework for the consultation and theconstruction of dictionaries.
The framework iscompletely generic in order to manageheterogeneous dictionaries with their own properstructures.
This framework is extensively used inPapillon project.1.2.1 Dictionary Markup Language (DML)The framework consists in the definition of anXML namespace1 called DML   (DictionaryMarkup Language).
All lexical data of a lexicaldatabase can be described with DML elements.The entire hierarchy of the XML files, elementsand attributes is described using XML schemataand grouped into the DML namespace.
Figure 1describes the organisation of the main DMLelements.DatabaseEntryDictionaryClientAPISupplierAPIVolumeUserHistoryGroupCDM set?headword?pos?pronunciation?translation?example?idiomBasic Types?boolean?integer?datefunctiontreegraphautomatonlinkFigure 1.
The DML FrameworkThe XML schemata are available online.
Thisallows users to edit and validate their files onlinewith an XML schema validator.1.2.2 Common Dictionary Markup (CDM)The DML framework may be used to encodemany different dictionary structures.
Indeed, twodictionary structures can be radically different.
Inorder to handle such heterogeneous structureswith the same tools, we have defined a subset ofDML element and attributes that are used to1  http://www-clips.imag.fr/geta/services/dmlidentify which part of the different structuresrepresent the same lexical information.
Thissubset is called Common Dictionary Markup(CDM).
This set is in constant evolution.
If thesame kind of information is found in severaldictionaries then a new element representing thispiece of information is added to the CDM set.
Itallows tools to have access to commoninformation in heterogeneous dictionaries by wayof pointers into the structures of the dictionaries.1.3 Three Layers for the Lexical DataThe lexical data repository of the Papillon projectis divided into 4 subdirectories:Administration contains guidelines andadministrative files???
?Hell (data in original format)Purgatory (data in XML & UTF-8)Paradise (data in Papillon format)The name of the files and directories isnormalised in order to allow easy navigation intothe repository.All lexical data stored in the repository is free ofrights or protected by a GPL-like licence.1.3.1 Hell DirectoryThis directory contains lexical data in theiroriginal format.
When a dictionary is received, itis first stored there while waiting to be ?recycled?.For each dictionary, we create a metadata filecontaining all available information concerningthe dictionary (name, languages covered,creation date, size, authors, domain, etc.).
It isthen used to evaluate the quality of the dictionaryand to guide the recycling process.
Thesedicitonaries are freely downloadable as they are.1.3.2 Purgatory DirectoryThe Purgatory directory receives the lexical dataonce the recuperation process is over.
Thisprocess consists in converting the lexical datafrom its original format into XML encoded inUTF-8.
To perform this task, we use theRECUPDIC methodology described inDoan-Nguyen (1998) regular expression toolslike Perl scripts.If a dictionary is already encoded in XML, therecuperation process consists in mapping theelements of information into CDM elements andstoring the correspondence into the metadata file.Internet users access these dictionaries asclassical online dictionaries, retrieving individualentries by way of requests on the Papillon website.1.3.3 Paradise DirectoryThe Paradise directory contains only onedictionary often called the "Papillon dictionary".This dictionary has a particular DML structure.Internet users access entries of this dictionary byway of requests to the Papillon web site.It is possible to retrieve only one entry, or anysubset of entries in any available output format.The ?native?
format is the Papillon textual XMLDML format in UTF-8.
Users also have ways toadd new entries or correct existing ones online.Other purgatory dictionaries may be integratedinto the Papillon dictionary with the help of theCDM elements.2 The Papillon MultilingualDictionary2.1 MacrostructureThe architecture of the Papillon multilingualdictionary is based on Gilles S?rasset (1994) andhas been prototyped by Blanc (1999).
Thisarchitecture uses a pivot structure based onmultiple monolingual volumes linked to aninterlingual acception volume.Each entry of a monolingual volume represents aword sense.
In this document, we use the term of?lexie?
as in the Explanatory and CombinatoryDictionary to name a monolingual entry.
Themeaning of ?lexie?
is not the same as ?lexeme?.A lexie is a complete monolingual entry.Figure 2.
Illustration of Papillon's macrostructure.The interlingual volume gathers all theinterlingual acceptions.
An interlingual acceptionrepresents the union of word-senses or ?lexies?considered as ?equivalent?
among differentmonolingual volumes.
This equivalence iscalculated from translation links.
In thisdocument, we use the term of ?axie?
to name aninterlingual acception.Real contrastive problems in lexical equivalence(not to be confused with monolingual polysemy,homonymy or synonymy as clearly explained inMel'cuk and Wanner (2001) arehandled by way of a special kindof link between axies.
Figure 2illustrates this architecture using aclassical example involving"Rice" in 4 languages.
In thisexample, we used the word sensesas given by the "Petit Robert"dictionary for French and the"Longman Dictionary ofContemporary English" forEnglish.
As shown, the French andEnglish dictionaries do not makeany word sense distinctionbetween cooked and uncookedrice seeds.
However, thisdistinction is clearly made inJapanese and Malay.
No axie maybe used to denote the union of theword senses for Malay "nasi" and"beras" unless we want to considerthem as true synonyms in Malay(which would be false).
Hence, wehave to create 3 different axies:one for the union of "nasi" and ??
(gohan), the other for the unionof "beras" and ?
(kome) and onefor the union of "rice" and "riz".
Alink (non-continuous line in Figure1 has to be added between the thirdaxies and the others in order tokeep the translation equivalencebetween the word-senses.Note that the links between axiesdo not bear any particularsemantics and should not beconfused with some kind ofontological links.Bilingual dictionaries can be obtained from themultilingual dictionary.2.2 MicrostructureThe structure of the lexies (units of themonolingual dictionaries) is based on Polgu?re(2000) and Mel'cuk?s work on the combinatorialand explanatory lexicography, a part of themeaning-text theory.
An XML schema using theDML framework has been defined to representthis structure as accurately as possible.This structure is common to all the monolingualdictionaries.

XML encoding of the French entry "meurtre" (excerpt)differences, small variations are authorised foreach monolingual lexicon.
Up to now, thesevariations have been used to define the parts ofspeech for each language and to add informationspecific to each language, such as level ofpoliteness and counters for Japanese.Figure 3 presents an excerpt of the XMLencoding of the French entry "meurtre" (murder)and Figure 4 shows a DEC-like view.The general schema has been presented in detailin Gilles S?rasset & Mathieu Mangeot-Lerebours(2001).3 Implementation of theCollaborative Web SiteFor the external user, the Papillon project isviewed as a dynamic web site providing accessthe existing dictionaries and giving ways tocontribute to the Papillon dictionary.3.1 General ArchitectureThe Papillon web site is built with a Java basedopen source framework called Enhydra2.
It isdesigned around a standard 3-tier architecturea presentation layer in charge of theinterface with the user.
We currently useclassical HTML/CSS rendering, but plan tointegrate WML access to the dictionaries(for mobile phones),?a business layer in charge of datamanipulation and transformation.
Wecurrently use XML data (in UTF-8) andXSL transformations for data manipulation,?a data layer in charge of the communicationwith the database via a JDBC driver.
Thedata layer should be managed by an XMLdatabase allowing language dependentsorting.
For the moment, XML databases arestill in an early stage.
In order to advance inthe project, a mapping system for DML hasbeen defined in order to store the XML datainto conventional relational databases.PostgreSQL is used at this point.
?3.2 Particular featuresAs different users may have different needs(translators, learners?)
we define differentviews of the Papillon dictionary.
Each view isencoded as a XSL stylesheet that is applied on theresult of each user query.
In the future, we willalso allow users to define their own custom viewsand store them on the server.
All thesetransformations are done on the server in order toallow users to use their preferred browser (even ifit is not XML aware).
Figure 4 shows an exampleof the French entry "MEURTRE" (murder)viewed as in Mel'cuk's DEC dictionary.2 available at www.enhydra.orgFigure 4.
French entry "meurtre" dynamicallydisplayed using Mel'cuk's classical viewTo avoid the unintentional pollution of thedatabase by erroneous data, the contributions of auser are to be validated by a central group oftrusted users.
In the mean time, the contributionsare stored as XSL stylesheets in the cntributor?sprivate space.Each time a user requests a corresponding entry,the request is performed in the main database andin the user space.
The results from the user spaceare used to modify results from the main database.This way, the contribution is immediately visibleto the user exactly as if it had been integrated intothe main database.While contributions are waiting to be validatedand integrated into the common space, Thecontributors may choose to share them with otherusers or groups of users.Every user can contribute at his/her level.
Forexample, a linguist specialist of lexical functionswill enter values of lexico-semantic functions, aphonologist pronunciations and a professionalbilingual translator will enter new interlinguallinks or check the semi-automatically generatedones.
For this, different interfaces will bedeveloped to accommodate the various userprofiles.3.3 Annex ToolsAs the web site hosts a rather complexcollaborative work, we have added some toolsthat are not related to lexicography, but that haveto work in a multilingual context.First, there is a tool to archive our Papillonmailing list.
Such a tool is very common onInternet sites.
However, as we found out, thesetools may not be used in our multilingual context,where mails may contain discussion in differentlanguages, written with different tools, andencoded using different standards.
Hence wepatched an existing tool so that it archives allmail in UTF-8, regardless of its originalencoding.To avoid the considerable work of the webmasterand to facilitate the communication and theexchange of informations between the users ofthe database, we are developing tools to facilitatethe use of a document repository.After registration and login, users can easilyupload online a file in whatever format.
It willimmediately be stored into the documentrepository and made accessible online on theweb.4 Actual Research and DevelopmentDirectionsThe Papillon project is a extremely interestingexperimentation platform.
We are currentlyworking on validation of monolingual data,management of axies and acquisition of newdata.4.1 Validation of the Monolingual DataA team of trusted lexicographers validates usercontributions before they are integrated into themain database.This validation is a time consuming process andimplies a good level in linguistics andlexicography.
Moreover, we may not find enoughspecialists volunteering for such a work and wemay have to pay a core team for this.This task is essential and should be conducted asquickly as possible lest the users will bediscouraged by the delays implied by the centralteam.Hence, even in this validation process, we wish toenroll users as much as possible.
For this task, weplan to implement tools for indirect validation ofinformation using vote mechanisms andgenerating questions answerable without anyspecial knowledge in linguistics.As a first experiment, we will use a Frenchgenerator in order to produce a lot of examplesusing the word to be validated and a set of knownwords (already validated).
These examples willbe presented to native speakers and they willsimply have to accept or reject them.
Thisstrategy is very interesting in our context, as itwill help validating the lexical functions.4.2 Management of the Interlingual LinksThe use of a pivot dictionary to representtranslation equivalence is challenging.
Thismacrostructure is very satisfying on a theoreticallevel, but introduces a high complexity ofmanagement.In S?rasset (1994), we envisaged that theseinterlingual acceptions would be created andmanaged by hand by a team of specialists, helpedby tools that would detect inconsistencies andpropagate decisions among the differentlanguages.
This appeared to be unrealistic.However, we now have means to manage theseacceptions automatically.
For this, we use the factthat the interlingual acceptions volume does not,in any way, represent a semantic pivot.
It is notrelated to an ontology.In fact, the only relevant purpose of thisinterlingual volume is to factorise the bilinguallinks we find in classical bilingual dictionaries(or the ones that will be specified by the users).Hence, given a set of translation equivalencesbetween monolingual acceptions of differentlanguages, it is possible to compute a minimal setof acceptions (and their links) that conforms to aset of well-formedness criteria.One of the difficult tasks is to obtain bilingualtranslation equivalences between monolingualacceptions when bilingual dictionaries oftenprovide bilingual links between mere lemmas.For this, we will use aligned corpora andtranslations memories to add contextualinformation to the translation pairs.4.3 Acquisition of new dataTo depend entirely on volunteer work is of courseunrealistic, especially while beginning to buildthe lexical database.
That is why we first reuseexisting dictionaries in order to build the kernelofthe database.Contributors will come in later, filling in missinginformationin existing entries and creating partialor complete new entries as well as links.However, as we are using a rather complexstructure which require some skills that are notshared by all Internet users, we will have to helpthem help us.In particular, we are beginning to usecorpus-based techniques to extract lemmas thatwill be candidates as a value of a lexical function.Determining the appropriate lexical function isone of the jobs of our contributors, but they willbe helped in this task by tools that will providethem with questions and candidate paraphrases.For a complement of information or to help thecontributors in their task, the database shouldalso propose the consultation of otherdictionaries stored locally or available online onthe web.Moreover, to be really useful for the reader, andespecially to the learners, the examples found inthe dictionaries will be translated in otherlanguages literally and semantically.
Some ofthese translations will be extracted from alignedcorpora.ConclusionThe theoretical frameworks for the wholedatabase, the macrostructure and themicrostructure are very well defined.
Itconstitutes a solid basis for the implementation.A lot of open problems still have to be addressedfor the Papillon project to be a success.
In thisrespect, the Papillon project appears to be a veryinteresting experimentation platform for a lot ofNLP research as data acquisition or human accessto lexical data, among others.All this research will improve the attraction ofsuch a project to the Internet users.
This attractionis necessary for the project to go on, as it is highlydependent on its users motivations.This way, we will be able to provide a veryinteresting multilingual lexical database that wehope useful for a lot of persons.ReferencesVutichai Ampornaramveth, Akiko Aizawa, KeizoOyama & Tanasee Methapisit (2000) AnInternet-Based Collaborative DictionaryDevelopment Project: SAIKAM., Proc.
