(A related problem of extracting conceptualinferences is d&scussed by Schank and Xieger (8 ).

Thus levels andstructure-concepts must be determined which can be used asa basic form of description of verbs in the dictionary.1.2.
Conceptual dependency interpretationsIn addition to such verb descriptions, which serve theanalysis task, the form of "targetu representations, i .
e .
ofthe l i t era l  interpretations must be considered.
The basica s s t q t i o n  underlying a choice of representation is that a"translation" from a metaphorical to a corresponding literalex:~ression cannot be achieved by manipulaf ion of componentsat any syntactic level.
What is needed is an tvinterlinguatt,which deals with relationships between concepts a t  thecognitive l eve l .
The conceptual represent at ions which applyt o  th ie  interlingua are not dependent on the o r ig ina l  lexicalform (or language) of the input, and can be used to generateparaphrases of the input i n to  the same or other languages,given the concept-to-syntax mapping rules f o r  that ~ongu$ge.The chdea of a form of conceptual representation must beguided by the extent to ~ h i c h  it shows re l , l t ionships  brtweenconcepts at the cognitive level.
The conceptual dependencytheory of Schank (6-9) provides such a- representation interms of predicntive and qual i fy ing dependencies betweenconceptual categories and is assumed as the context of themethod presented here.In a dependency, according t o  this theory, a concepto f  one conceptual category is dependent on, qual i f i e s  directlyor serves to describe a concept of another conceptual categoryaccording to rules of conceivability.
These unambiguous,language-free dependencies are word-independent, although theconcept symbols on occasion map directly in to  some lexicalterm expressing these concepts.
The nature o f  conceptualdependency representations, as well as their s u i t a b i l i t y  f o rmetaphor analyses, can be conveyed by a simple example.
'Theink stained the f loor'  can be represented conceptually as.
.
inkcolor: X j  .
The significance of thlscolors x irepresentation lies not i n  the particular hotation adopted,but in the components of meaning which it r c v e ~ l s .
Thedots (... ...) indicate tht1t the ink is not necessnrily theagent, but is merely somehow involved in thc action.
The~ ~ d k @ t b n  arrow!'
( m) indicates n causal reLn tionship asopposed to thc eesclmple 'the ink h i t  the floorv.
'Thenotation indicntcs n change of s t a t e  of tfloorl, ar mares p e c i f i c n l l y ,  an Inalienable P U T  of the floor.
The 'NEJ~ative'notation is a iconnotationtt ( 5 )  wl~ich is secondary to thepurely objective representdtion of 'stainT.If it is assumed that the use of metaphor relies on somesimilarity of semantic components between an ordinary and anextended sense, it c.ln be seen that a representation of thistype, ref Lecting a conceptually-oriented sen-ntic theory,  isndequcte to the task at hand.
By reference to the abstractcomponents of causation, change of state,  pert vs. %,hole andnegativeness r e v e ~ l e d  by the iibove c u n c e p t u ~ l  structure for*staint, a paraphrase for the metaphorical 'his  businessactivities stained his reputationT is essily npproximated;'his activities csused a neg~.tive change in (part of) hisreputation1.
There is no dependence on complex trznsforrna-tions or mukt ip l e  word senses, which might in fact fail inthe: case of novel f oms of expression, such as more rtcreative"metaphor.The components of conceptual dependency representationcan be briefly described as follows.
The conceptual categoriesbetween which the various conceptdal dependencies exist areACT, PP ( l fpicture produceru) and PA ("picture assistcr~),At tho eyntaoti~ level ,  these categories are sometimes e mpremed in the English language by verbs ,  nouns and adjec-tives respectively.
However, such correspondence does notalways occur.
For example, many nouns can be expresseddirectly in terms of verbal o r  attributive concepts ('the' tha t  which,..').
Such nouns would not b e  s t a t c  of... ,mapped directly i n to  PPs.The dependencies which hold between the  specif iedcategories o t  the cognit ive  level must ult imittely b e  given*by a uconceptual grammarM which reflects their conceivabilityand theref ore their comprehensibility.
Such n grammar,independent 6f actual word-construct usage, would includeinformation such as what kind of concepts can be related bya specification of p o s i t i o n  in time.
Our concern here,however, w i l l  be mainly with the lower-level  and more detailedinformation contained i n  a bfconceptuolizationl', or s i m p l econoeptual s tructure.The general conceptual dependency format which has beenestablished for the conceptualizations which w i l l  be referredto takes one of the fo l lowing  forms (semantic terms whichare irrelevsnt to t he  metaphor problem, such as tense,will be ignored):<relation>PP (object)  PP (object)ONe,g.
ink f l o o rThe ink is on the f l o o rThe ink is in contact with the floorPP (objec t )  < PA (attribute)e-g. ink <+> COWR:  blackThe ink is blackThe ink has a black c o l o r(attribute-value (new)>(change of s t a t e )(attribute-value (old))CCLOR: blacke.g.
inkCOLOR: ?The ink turned blackThe ink changed to a black color(goal>PP (actor) < $  r-lm (action) +PP (object +- C <source,I(continued) +<instrumental conceptualization>Eiarye.g.

It is theseprimitive concept8 rather than :my snecif ic lexical verbwhich w i l l  be retrieved from the matrix as output of anoperational metaphor routine.2.1, LevelsThe four levels postulated for vcrbnl concepts are:PIIYSJCAL (e.g.
'touch1)mNT& (em& 'think' )SENSOR' (e.g.
'seet)CONTROL (e.g.
'donate')The PHYSICAL Level includes verbs which predicate theexistence, attributes or associations of objects w i t hspat ia l  (material) aspects,The PENTAL - l e v e l  is distincf in that on t h i slevel ere representations of objects, or of other represen-tations in a recursive manner.
It is thus the l e v e l  throughwhlh thought and communication take place.
Verbs of thoughthave been analyzed in (8).
Since l;Ch'T& objects are notreal-world objects  or situations, but rather pointers tosuch objects, they cannot be concqtually dependent onnon-3ENTAL concepts other than (usually human) mentalprocessors.The SENSORY level includes V W s  of perception, or thereception of %utgesl1.
Concepts on this l eve l  prnvi.de thel i n k  f r ~ m  the physical world t o  the consciousness of alanguage user as well as to o t h e r  animate beings.
SEXMRYconcepts could be analyzed in PHYSICAL (spatial and temporal)terms.
However, th i s  kind of dctail seems to have littlerelevance to the linguistic groblbms under considerhtion.The CCNTRLL level refers t o  relationships which expresspossession or cor l t ro l  by an animate being.
An object ont h i s  l e v e l  is a form of control, or a "potential for actionfr.CONiiiOL mRBs basically consist of conditions attached to theactions of an animate being and are sometimes ewressedlexically through modal auxiliaries, for example as 'can','may * or 'must *.
Possession defined as a CONTlWL relat ion-s h i p  is thus distinguished from purely PIIYSILiL or locativeralntionships.
The verb 'have ( a  physical  ob jec t ) ' ,  forexample, is defined in terms of the  CON?R\L Level r a t h e rt b n  the PHYsICAL level.Each of these levels has a few sublevels (e.g.
SENSORY:eye, ear) which are sometimes spec i f i ca l ly  referenced inmetaphorical extensions.
These are described in (5).2.2.
Sta tesGiven the matrix format of the verb descriptors, thespecified levels (row components ) can best be clsrifiedby conoiderntion of the Its i m p l e s t w  structure (column component)as it  applies  on each level.
This structure is referred toas a STATE o r  as  a ST.iTIC structure,  and represents i n  generalterms "existence, with or without an n t t r i b u t e ,  and with orwithout association with another objectft .
ST.iTBs are  pre-sented here in two forms which represent the ' + I  and * - *values o f  one of the "featurestr (Section 2.4) which furtherdif  fercntiate VERBS, These two feL~-!.

Perceptiani n  turn has two forms--the predicction -_ _ _ __- of the existence ofthe - Object, and the valued perception of a p r e s u ~ o s e d  Object.Only the former t y p e  i s  examined here.It is first noted that this and each sublevcl allowsfor an R-, 0- and VU-form or' a VLB.
0 = Object, R =Recipient or experiencer ( "loc~tion" , "sollrcelt or "goal t tof O ) ,  dnd VAL = VALW of 0.
The labels R,  0 and VXL indicatewhether the lexical entry which n ~ p s  into the slcts headedby these lzbels expresses a verbal concept from the p c i n t  o fview of R or 0, o r  expresses a value 02  0.

One of t he  general problems of meta-phorical interpretation is to show in the re wesentation ofa phrase the analogy to a conceptual object , as w e l l  as'%hat is re3119 happeningg".Theb in7ut  ex.irn,>le 'his sb..ile disintegratedt shouldproduce the same r e p r e s e n t a t i o n  as  that of 'he stoppedsmilingt.

This tnslc rcrluires a verb def initi.cn procedure suchas the  one presented here, r:hich rcsts on n sm 11 number ofconceptual elements.

Thisnotat ion does not express any relationship between the threeforms of the exxn7le given above.
Howevef, it is rnnpyed outoL TR-L, which does show this relatianship and is referredt o  in  the f o l l o w i n g  analysis of 'his  indifference disintegratedvBriefly, 'disintegrate ' ~s defined as changing fromexistence to non-existence of an object, on the PHYSICALlevel :  ((PH) TTt-L (STATE 0 BE)...).
since 'indifferencevis not consxstent wit11 the PHYSICAL l eve l ,  a base-levelinterpretation fails.
Since 'he ' is +ANIIL?LTE, the IEmAL-l eve l  noun 'indifferencet can serve as an a t t r i b u t e  of  'hetas ex,eriencer A.
There are no feature specifications whichm u ; t  be f u l f i l l e d  by the a t t r i b u t e  * indiffercncc ' ; theref o r ethere crc no obstacles  t o  an intc?rprat,ition on the PiJY'l'ALlevel.
Thc delfinition of 'indiffcrcncet yields the descriptors'((1.C A) (sT.:C& (0 r r f  R) (VAL +-))) ' ,  where 'A' representsiVAL, i.e.

The program thus entersthe matrix with dimension informarion (b& A K bTL!1'E +H +- ) toobtain a corres1,onding K-role VEI\D.
It finds 'be-indif f erent-to1, uses the R nlrenriy determined as subject and adds struc-ture element TR-L given by the ver,b to obtain 'he STOP be-indifferent-to...', leaving n slot for the object of theindif  iercnce.The procedure is s i m i l n r  for 'his  smile disintegrated '.The mogrcm determines o cdtegory ~ h i f t  and nccet*s the TR-Lstructure f o r  'disintegratef with the Itloss of existcncell of0 (0 BE) interpreted as che tt loss  of sta te1 '  of ii (0 AT R).Thus the resulting R-role representation is the sane as t hd tfor 'he stopped smilingt.
(It might be noted t h s t  the sub-stitution of a concept sucha s 'smilet for n physical objectcould be represented as a P H Y S I U - t o - A C T I V C , s b i f t ,  if anACTIVE level ispostulated f o r  HO3lIN~iLs snd VERBS ( 5 ) .pursuit of this  approach would designate this example, likethe o the r  exmples of t h i s  section, as n case of l evL  1 s h i f t .

but in a non- straight?
orword way, sincea level shift  and/or-an - object-feature sh -ft may k involved.Iq the exam2Les 'John Bilged the cat' and 'the House k i l l e dthe bill ', the ordinary object of 1 ( c c t  ) is no morea mere ;d~ysical ob j & c t  than t h e  metcpY.oricc1 object  (tbillt )is a mere mental object.
The P~?YSI~-to-i~iiW.~L extensionin the aecond example is obscured by the simultaneouspresence of an object-feature shift.To c l a r i f y  the r o l e  which each type of s h i f t  plays, asimilar example is first presented which involves onlyob ject-feat- s hift: 'he killed thcmotor I .
This examplecould be more explicitly paraphrased as 'he d id  somethingwhich caused the motar to die*, The interpretation dependson what it mewrr-fot the cbject.
*motdrt, to 'd ie1  or 'bedead'.
It would be deo%rablc 'to obtain the interpretation'he stopped the opekathn or r n i n g  of the motorv, whilerejecting a s b - s  intcrplrtation for  'he ki l l ea  the stone1.
*Motor* and 'stone * are,both RIYaICAL NObIINC\Ls; no l e v e lshift is involved.
Rather, the +ANII~IYZ specification onthe object is violated, yielding a mctaphoriccl, interpreta-tion in the first case and no interpretation in the second.
?Motort is a medningful object of 'kill1 because it is a~ ~ I C  NOMIN L-, its function king to r u n .
( It i s  reca l ledfrom Section 3.1 that the +DYNAMIC feature value specifies afunction which can be identiEied with the part icular  meaningof a NOMINAL.)
When a motor is ?killeda, t h i s  func t ionattribute is eliminated-- a consequence which.
differs frome.g.
the disintegration of the motor  which might representits being 'destroyed'.The proceaure of the program operating on the first twoexamples canbe outlined as follows.
The semantic repre-sentation for 'kill is :(kill ( (PHYS)  TR-L (STATE (0 <FN(O)>)) (ROLL 0) (IGDIT +)(TRY-1 .
a .CO (N1W (AN'IM t))) (BRD (UYN + ) )  )).For the exmple 'John k i l l e d  the cat I ,  the progrim w i l l  findt h a t  all specifications on the NOMIN &s by the definition o fthe verb ere met by the wrds of the in3ut.
In p.lrticular,'u 'Pttrd'n'tt is + '.~TIBk'~TE; thdt  is, in terms of DYNAMIC FUNCfIOK,it 'livest in a literal sense, Thus the Liter,til sense of'kill' 'is accepted.
If the inbuttJohn killed the stonet isencountered, the program notes t h a t  ' stone has no r.'~NIEtiTEfeature vCllue and therefore f a i l s  a base interpretation.Furthermore, 'st one isno t +DYNAMIC and theref ore does notsat isfy  t h e  'Broadt specif ications necessdry f o r  a mcta-phorical interpretation.The input ' the  House k i l l e d  the bill presents a moreinteresting case, '~ouse' i n  the sense of ' ~ o u s e  of Repre-sentative~~ or 'Lower HouseT h:*s the +ANIPLiTX featurepreferred by the target representation condi t ions  on anAGE;NT as s p e c i f i e d  above- with respect to ' s h i p t ;  however,(bill1 does not hove the +ANINATE feature value as  requiredby 'killt.
Thus a base-level interpretat ion is rejected.IIowever, t b i l l  does have the +DYNAPlIC v ~ l u e ,  correspondingt o  the observation t ha t  it has a ucontinuous effectly on people.Thus the bas ic  components are sa t i s f i ed  for an interpretation.since the dispensable 'Narrow + A N I ~ $ ~ T E  descr ip tor ,  i. e. thel i t e r a l  live' function, is v i o l ~ t e d ,  b ut the minimal, i. e.'Brood1 requirements are fulfilled, the employment of 'killtis considered a metaphoricill extension from the l+IIYSfCAL tothe EZ1:NTAL level, The structure TR-L ( C L "  0 N O  ) )(AGENT +) then yields the paraphrase lHouse &TOP bill becomelaw', where 'lawt is n COXI'WL concept r e ~ ~ r e a c n t c d  in termsof lone mustt and lone nmyt.Gy no t i=  t h a t  which il; co\~-unon to both the base senseand metnphorical senses of  ' k i l l ' ,  w e  c.ln cotl-tp rc the m&nn-ings of thcoc srnscu.

The further ~.evelopment of  the above rnech-animsms must precede an implementation o f  the more coclplexnow-compound metaphor analysis ; however, the =.p,n-oach t ointerpretation of such constructs can be indicated.

Thus the f rclmework exists i o rhandling some metap i~o r i ch l l y  used noun constructs withunderlying verbal and/or ettribvtive concepts.The examples of Sections 5.1-5.4 are representative oft he  v ~ r i o u s  metaphor mech:tnisms which have been identified.The (;uestion arises as to the extent to which such mechanismshold for any metaphorical use of a verbal or a t t r i b u t i v econcept.
An assessment of the v a l i d i t y  of the nnClysismethod f o r  such metaphorical uses depends upon 1) the com-pleteness of t h o  identified ca t ego r i e s ,  i.e.
whether suchcategories cover all types of verbs in the  c lass  undercons idera t ion;  2 )  whether ~ u c h  ca t ego r i e s  cre based on themost "importantH component which enters into metaphoricalextensions; and 3 )  the extent t o  ~ h i c h  v: .r iot ions within acategory af~ect the  plausibility of a n  i n t e r p r e t c t i c n .
Thefirst two condi t ions  a r e  concerned.r:itk thc quootion of 2"rninirn4lM interpret'.tion, i. e. thc exclusion of n :!lscflinterpretation, the t h i r d  with an "adequate" i n t e r p r e t  ation.With tespect to the first point, the Verb descriptionsystem presented has intenticnnlly focused on the breautho r  scope of the categorization r d h e r  t h m  on 2. more deta i l edil~ustr~tion of any one category.
Such an ovcrview must havep r i o r  consideration bccciuse the  trensl; t i o n  of a mctaphoriccllverb requires c o m p z r i s ~ n  wi th  o the r  vrrbs, which themselvesmust be assigned a ~ t l o c c t i o n ' l  within thc s y s t e m  bclr'orc ~ n yrefinement of inter~retat ions can b enin.
