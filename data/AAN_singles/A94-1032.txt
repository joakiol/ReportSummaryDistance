Applying this method to the compilation of a userdictionary targeting newspaper article sentences andsentences ofsoftware design documents has revealed thatthe automatically determined SAs include 50 to 80% ofthe correct attributes.
Translation experiments confirmedthat the automatically acquired SAs improved translationquality by 6-13%.1.
Introduct ionWhen working with a MT(machine translation) system,users compile user dictionaries for the words which are notregistered in the system dictionaries or for those withinappropriate ranslations \[1\].
But when registering newwords in a dictionary, there is a need to give not just theindex word and translated word, but also syntactic,semantic and various other information.
Systems aiming athigher levels of translation quality require more detailedand accurate information \[2,3\], and it is no simple task forlaymen to give such information.
In particular, semanticinformation usually requires the skill of professionals.In this paper, attention has been focused on thecharacteristics of user defined words.
A method isproposed where for index words (noun words or compoundnouns) in the original language that users eek to register,one need give only the translation i  the target language topermit he system apply the knowledge held in the systemdictionaries, automatically judge the type of noun anddetermine the SAs of the word for the noun types.2.
System Dictionaries and User Dictionaries2.1 Semant ic  Dict ionaries in ALT- J /EHere, we shall refer to the dictionary prepared inadvance by the MT system as a system dictionary and thedictionary prepared and used by users as a user dictionary.Semantic Attribute Systemsbu%NO  ticI 2,800 Attributes -~200 Attributes -~bute System100 AttributesFor the case of the Japanese to English MT systemALT-J/E\[4\], the relationship between the systemdictionaries, the user dictionaries and word SAs are shownin Figure 1.
In the semantic dictionaries, semanticinformation is written using SAs.Common nouns in the semantic word dictionary aregiven common oun SAs (generally more than one).
Forproper nouns, both common oun SAs and proper nounS/ks(beth more than one) are given.
Verbal SAs are givento sentence patterns registered in the semantic structuredictionary \[5\].3.
Determinat ion  of Semant ic  Attr ibutesA method of determining the SAs of user defined wordsis shown in Figure 2.
This method works using theinformation held in the system dictionaries when indexwords (Japanese xpressions) of user defined words andtheir translations(English) have been provided by the user.?

EvaluationThe proposed method was used to determine the SAsto create user dictionaries for translating newspaperarticles and software design documents shown in Tabe 3.The following 3 methods were examined.
(~) Automatic Determination (Proposed Method)(~) Manual Determination (Manual Method)(~) Experimental Determination (Correct Attributes)(1) Accuracy of Noun Type (Table 2)In the case of newspaper articles, the method's accuracyin determining the noun type was 93.5%.
Manualdetermination achieved an accuracy rote of 94.8%.
Similarresults were obtained for the software specificationdocuments.Table 2.

This improvement is almost he same as thatachieved with manually determined SAs.
The translationsuccess rate is 2-3% lower than that achieved with thecorrect attributes.
This is, however, satisfactory if weconsider the high cost needed to obtain the correctattribute by repeatedly tuning them.Thus, automatic determination makes it possible toacquire useful sets of SAs; a task which normally requiresthe most labor in creating user dictionaries.6.
SummaryA method that automatically determines the SAs of userdefined words was proposed.
The method was applied tocreate the dictionaries needed to translate severalnewspaper a ticles and some software specifications.
Theresults show that the automatically determined SAsinclude 50 to 80% of the correct attributes.
This value is5-10% smaller than that achieved with manualdetermination (50 "~ 90%), but is still high enough toimprove translation quality.
Translation experimentsconfirmed that using the automatically determined SAsimproved translation quality by 6-13%.References(1) J. Carbonell et.
