17D-70174 Stut tgar t ,  Germanyleo@ims,  uni-stuttgart, deAbstractIn this paper, we address one of the central problemsin text generation: the missing link ("the generationgap" in Meteer's terms) between the global discourseorganization as often provided by text planning mod-ules and the linguistic realization of this organiza-tion.
We argue that the link should be establishedby the lexical choice proces  using resources derivedfrom Mel'~uk's Lezical Functions (LFs).
In particular,we demonstrate hat sequences of LFs may well serveas lexical discourse structure relations which link up toglobal discourse relations in the output of a RhetoricalStructure Theory style text planner.1 Introduction1.1 Ident i fy ing  the  Generat ion  GapIn text generation, content selection and discourse or-ganization (i.e.
the text planning tasks) have oftenbeen dealt with independently from the linguistic re-alization of the tezt p lan -  the information selectedand structured by the text planning process (eft, e.g.,\[McKeown and Swartout, 1987\]).
However, a textplanning process which does not take into account lin-guistic resources that are available to express a par-ticular meaning suffers from two major shortcomings:(i) it is not sensitive to variant discourse organiza-tions at the sentence level; and (ii) it cannot guar-antee that its text plan is always verbalizable by thelinguistic module.
With other words, there is a dis-crepancy (a "generation gap" in Meteer's terms) be-tween a text plan that is not tailored to linguisticresources and the input as required by the linguisticrealization module.
For extensive xamples that illus-trate this, see, especially Meteer's work \[Mercer, 1991\]and \[Mercer, 1992\], but also, e.g., \[Rubinoff, 1992,Vander Linden et al, 1992\].
In our work, we havefound that especially lexical phenomena (such as lex-ical cooccurrence and lexical semantics) play an im-portant role in discourse organization at the level ofsentence planning, which is still one of the unsolvedproblems in text planning, cf.
\[Hovy, 1991\].
Considerthe following example:(1) a. Opa schofl auff den Einbrecher, dernun tot istlit.
'Grandpa shot at the burglax whois now dead'.The interpretation f (la) does not necessarily suggestthat burglar's death is in consequence of grandpa'sshooting.
To communicate his relation, (lb) is moreappropriate:(1) b. Opa sehofl au\] den Einbrecher undt J tete ihn/ verwundete ihn tJdlichlit.
'Grandpa shot at the burglar andkilled him/wounded him deadly'.However, despite an analogous syntactic onstruction,(2) suggests the interpretation that grandpa's beingwell is in consequence of doctor's curing:(2) Der Arzt heilte Opa, der nun ganz gesundist\].it.
'The doctor cured grandpa, who isnow completely well'.That is, the consideration of lexical phenomenahelps to resolve the discrepancy between discoursestructure relations (as, e.g., given by Rhetorical Struc-ture Theory (RST) \[Mann and Thompson, 1987\]) andtheir linguistic realization.
Therefore, a text genera-tor has to provide an organization of lexical resourceswhich makes explicit the rhetorical potential of lexicalphenomena and which allows for the purposeful choiceof these phenomena.In principle, three ways seem to be feasible for howto proceed: (i) to broaden the task of text planning bylexical choice (eft, e.g., \[Mercer, 1992\]), (ii) to realizean interaction link between the linguistic realizationmodule and text planning (eft, e.g., \[Rubinoff, 1992\]),or Off) to broaden the task of linguistic realization inorder to deal with a final, lexically guided determina-tion of a discourse organization that has been prede-termined by text planning.1377th International Generation Workshop * Kennebunkport, Maine ?

This is, in order tokeep s separate level of discourse organization that isrealized independently from linguistic resources andto make use of the potential of linguistic resources toguide the discourse organization at a more detailedlevel than conventional text planning is able to do.
Incontrast o, e.g., \[Fawcett et al, 1992\] and \[Elhadadand Robin, 1_992\], who deal with lexically biased sen-tence organization within the grammar, we take a rad-ically lexicalist position (similar to that of \[McDonald,1991\]) in that we assume that lexicalization has totake place before grammatical realization; and that itis the words chosen, which dictate the possible syn-tactic realizations of a content o be communicated.More precisely, we propose a two level discourse or-ganization where the first level is provided by an RSTstyle text planner and the second level by a separatelexical choice module.
Then, the discourse organiza-tion of a text is done in two steps: in the first step,the text planner predetermines the discourse structurerelations and selects the content; in the second step,the lexical choice module provides, in accordance withlinguistic constraints, a finer specification and the re-alization of these relations and tailors their content olinguistic realization.1.2 The  F rameworkThe computational framework in which our lexicalchoice model has partially been implemented is thesystemic text generator KOMET \[Bateman et al, 1991\].One source of constraints for the first level text orga-nization comes in KOMET from an RST-based planner, zThe output of this planner is a collection of case frameswith RST relations holding between them as shown inFigure 1.Starting from such a text plan, the lexical choice1 Recent developments of this p lanner  are described in \[Hovyet  a l .
,  1992\].Figure 2: PGS structure for the sentence Opa schoflauf den Einbrecher und verwundete ihn tSdlich lit'Grandpa shot at the burglax and wounded him deadly'module has to construct an input to the grammar(in KOMET m a systemic grammar of German \[Te-ich, 1992\]).
This input contains the lexicalization ofthe text plan content and constraints for its syntacticrealization.
Figure 2 shows such an input (called Par-tial Grammatical Structure (P6S)) 2 encoded in termsof Typed Feature Structures (TFSs) \[Emele, 1989\].
Thisinput has been derived from the text plan in Figure 1.sIn what follows, we present an ongoing attempt odefine a general model of lexical resources which wouldprovide the missing link between the global discourseorganization as given by discourse structure relationsin the text plan and its linguistic realization.
In partic-ular, we show how Mel'~uk's Lezical Functions (LFS)(cf., e.g., \[Mel'~uk and Polgu~re, 1987\]) can be usedto compile such a general model.
After the introduc-tion of the general principles that underly our organi-zation of lexical resources, we focus on LF sequences.We demonstrate that they may well function as lex-ically biased discourse structure relations at the in-trasentential level; and, thus, be interpreted as a finerspecification of global discourse structure relations.2A oos corresponds, roughly speaking, to the Partial Sur-face Functional Description (PSFD) specification i  the COMErsystem \[MeKeown et aL, 1991\].SThe current implementations of the lexical choice moduleand the grammar still require an additional mapping betweenthe pGs and the input ax taken by the grammar.
Since thismapping is, however, purely due to implementational details, itis of no interest here.1387th International Generation Workshop ?

June 21-24, 19942 Overv iew of the Lexical Re-sources Organizat ionWhile designing a lexical choice model, it is importantto note that (a) lexical phenomena and, therefore, alsolexical choices that are available to communicate aspecific meaning are dependent on this meaning; and(b) lexical phenomena are involved at different stagesof the utterance construction process.
Thus, the pro-cess of SHOOTING has another lexiealization potentialthan that of CURINC; and the choice of fierce in Theterrorists put up fierce resistance is done at anotherstage than the choice of put up.
This calls for:?
a (fairly) excaustive coverage of the lexical po-tential of each semantic entity (such as process,event, etc.);?
clustering of lexical resources locally to semanticunits of a certain size;?
a multilayered organization of lexical resources(and therefore also a multilayered lexical choiceprocess).In our model, the resources are provided mainly byLezical Functions as introduced in the Meaning TextTheory (MTT).
They are clustered locally to situationsand organized into four layers.2.1 Us ing  Lex ica l  Funct ions  as  theSource  o f  Lex ica l  ResourcesMost excaustively, hxical phenomena have been de-scribed in MTT by ?exical Functions.Roughly speaking, an LF f is a standard semantico-lexical relation which holds between a lexeme L, (thekeyword of f) and a set of lexemes f(L) (the value ofIf).
Consider the following examples:So: 'situation'Sl : 'actor'Sin~tr: ' instrttment 'Ao: 'situational dj?V0: 'action'A.nti: 'antonym'Gener: 'hyperonyra'Magn: 'intense(ly)'Incep: 'beginning'Oper l :  'perform'P repar :  'prepare'P rox :  'be about to'So(to shoot) = shotSl(tO ShOOt) = 9=nman, marksmanSinstr(to shoot) = r/fie, ann .
.
.
.Ao(death) = mortalVo(,ho0 = \[to\] ~hoot, \[to\] ~,,Anti(to hit) = \[to\] missGener( rifl,) = fire-armMagn( injury) = ,e~eremcep(com=) = \[to\] tap,~It,to\] (corn,0Operl(shot) = \[to\] take(a  shot)Prepar(to ,hoot) = \[to\] chargeProx(to shoot) = \[to\] aim atMel'~uk distinguishes about sixty simple LFS of theabove kind.
Simple LFs can further be composed witheach other; the meaning of such complex LFs is, as arule, a composition of the meanings of the participat-ing LFS.
Thus, Ant iMagn means 'slightly' (e.g., An-t iMagn(injury)  = minor); and IncepOper l  'startperforming' (e.g., IncepOper1(shooting) = \[to\] start(shooting)).
If several (simple or complex) LFs com-pose a phrase or a clause (as, e.g., Ant iMagn and Socompose minor injury), we separate these LFs by a 'o'sign.In addition to complex LFs, we introduce LFsequences - -  pairs of LFS (denoted LF1 A LFz),whose values cooccur at the syntagmatic axis.
Forexample, Prepar(shooting) A Vo(shooting) withPrepar(shooting) = \[to\] charge (the gun) andVo(shooting) = \[to\] shoot in He charged the gun andshot.
LF sequences are directed, i.e.
LFx A LF2LF2 A LFx.
Consider, e.g., P repar  A V0, which isan instantiation of a TEMPORAL SEQUENCE relationwith the first LF expression preceding the second onthe temporal axis, and V0 A Prepar  as in He shotafter charging the gun, where the first LF expressionsucceeds the second.
Moreover, the existence of LFxA LFz for an entity in a language does not mean thatLF2 A LFz is also available (consider, e.g., the follow-ing instantiation ofA0 A Magn o So: She is beautiful- -  a real beauty and Magn o So A A0: *She is a realbeauty - -  beautiful.
Therefore, in LF sequences, oneargument is the 'hub' m the point of departure (orthe expanded LF) and the other argument is the 'hubexpander'.LFs and LF sequences (henceforth, both are referredto as 'LFS') have well-defined syntactic realizations.For example, Operz is defined as taking the ACTORas grammatical'subject and the keyword of the sit-uation as direct object.
The LF sequence Oper l  AMagn o So - -  when applied to SHOOTING m can berealized as a paratactic omplex clause (of.
Grandpatook a shot at the burglar; it was a good shot.~ or asa simple clause (eft Grandpa took a good shot at theburglar), but not, e.g., as a hypotactic omplex clause(eft *Grandpa took a shot at the burglar, which was agood shot/one).
And so on.2 .2  Compi l ing  Lex ica l  Resources  Lo -ca l ly  to  S i tuat ionsIn accordance with \[Apresjan, 1974\], a situation iscomprehensively defined by: 1. a predicate; 2. theconstituents (i.e.
potential participants and circum-stantials) of this predicate; 3. the relations betweendifferent constituents as well as between constituentsand the predicate (these relations are usually given interms of actions, states, etc.
); 4. the features of thepredicate, constituents, and the above actions and re-lations.The lexical resources of a situation (the Lezicaliza-1397th International Generation Workshop ?
Kennebunkport, Maine ?
June 21-24, 1994tion Cluster in terms of \[McDonald, 1991\]) are thengiven by all possible wordings of the entities this sit-uation is defined by.
For example, SHOOTING is a sit-uation with the predicate named shooting, shot, etc.
;with the participants ACTOR (named gunman, marks-man, etc.)
and ACTEE (named target, victim, ...);with the obligatory circumstantials INSTRUMENT (r/-fie, gun, etc.)
and MEANS (bullet), and optional cir-cumstantials LOCATION, TIME, etc., which do not havea situation-specific lexicalization.
Among the ACTOR'Sactions are shoot, fire, kill, wound, etc.
The lexicaliza-tions of the relations between ACTOR and the pred-icate include, e.g., the performance of the situation(fire (a shot), take (a shot), etc.
); those between AC-TOR and ACTEE - -  aim (at), hit, etc.
The features ofACTOR include skilled, good, lousy, .
.
.
.
And so on.The various LFs - -  with the label of a situationas keyword - -  supply us with all lexical expressionsthat communicate he entities this situation is definedby; see the list above for examples with respect toSHOOTING .42 .3  Organ izat ion  o f  Lex ica l  Resourcesas  a Mu l t i l ayered  Mode lAs stated above, we organize situation-specific lexi-cat resources that are provided by the LF informationinto four layers.
The layers are called IntersituationalLayer, Intrasituational Layer, Constituent Layer, andLexeme Layer, respectively.
The first three layers aremotivated by the semantic onstituency of expressionsas provided by LFS: 1. two predicate structures (asgiven by LF sequences) are dealt with at the intersitu-ational ayer; 2. predicate structures (as given, e.g., bythe Operx function) - -  at the intrasituational layer;and 3. predicate constituent structures (as given, e.g.,by the St function) - -  at the constituent layer.
Atthe lexeme layer, the LFS are unified with concretelexemes,LFs correspond to knowledge at varying levels of ab-straction (see the discussion in \[Wanner and Bateman,1990\]); therefore, we organize them coherently at eachof the first three layers in network form in terms of thefunctional, semantic, and syntactic features that theyrepresent (cf.
also \[Wanner, 1992\]).
For example, theOper l  function is decomposed as {actor.realization,situation-oriented, actor-salience, .
.
.}.
Within thisorganization, the most general structures provide therepresentation f lexical semantics and the most deli-4Evidently, semantically related situations have intersectinglexicalization clusters.
In order to achieve an efficient organi-zation of the overall exical resources, we use inheritance t ch-niques, cf.

\[Halliday, 1985\].cate ones -- lexicalization.A PGS is then built up b\ ]  the lexical choice processby a successive traversal of the layers starting from theintersituational layer.
How this is done is describedin detail in \[Wanner, 1992\].
Here we focus on theorganization of the layers and on the interface betweenthe output of the text planning module and lexicalresources.In what follows, each layer is described briefly(starting with the lexeme layer).
Note that this de-scription is necessarily extremely oversimplified; itlargely abstracts from the actual representation i  asystemic functional framework.Lexeme Layer .
The lexeme layer contains LF - LFvalue pairs.

The constituent layer containsfeature specifications for the realization of predicateconstituents and their attributes,  For example, toname the ACTOR in SHOOTING, his/her proper name;a situation non-specific realization, e.g., his/her func-tion in relation to other entities in the knowledgebase (e.g., grandfather); the situation-specific and con-textually neutral lexeme marksman; or a negativelyloaded situation-related xpression such as murderer,killer, etc.
can be chosen.

"External" means 'at other layers of the same clus-ter' or 'in clusters of other situations'.
Clusters ofother situations are identified by labels in small cap-itals (preceded by an uparrow).
The labels in bolddenote roles which are introduced into the PGS when6To keep the presentation simple, we do not discuss the at-tributes here.1407th International Generation Workshop ?

June 21-24, 1994the corresponding feature is chosen during the networktraversal.The fragment shows that there are pointers to fea-tures in.
other lexicalization clusters and to features atlower layers of the same lexicalization cluster (of.
thepointer to S1 at the lexeme layer).Intrasituational Layer.
The intrasituational layercontains feature specifications for the realization ofpredicates and their attributes.
For example, to ex-press ACTOR's performance of SHOOTING, e.g., V0 (\[tO\] shoot), Operl  (\[to\] take a shot, \[to\] fire a shot),etc.
are available; but not, e.g., Oper2 (*\[to\] get ashot as in * The burglar got a shot from grandpa).
Inour functional interpretation, the difference between\[to\] shoot and the other options is that it is 'action-oriented', while the others are 'situation-oriented'.
If\[to\] get a shot were grammatical, it would emphasize'actee-salience' (as \[to\] be shot does), while the otheroptions mentioned emphasize 'actor-salience'.
In net-work form, this looks as follows (see \[Wanner andBateman, 1990\] for a detailed iscussion):axis: the 'causation' and the 'initial' phases precedethe 'continuing' and the 'final' phases; the 'continu-ing' phase precedes the 'final' phase, etc.
Further, thephases 'initial' and 'final' are related to SHOOTING it-self.As global, for example, the different PREPARA-TION actions (PREPARATION / (verbalized, e.g., by \[to\]charge the gun) and PREPARATION// (verbalized, e.g.,by \[to\] cock the trigger) precede SHOOTING; ACTOR'sand ACTEE'S actions that follow SHOOTING as well asthe 'resulting state' of ACTEE succeed it.
In the follow-ing fragment, only the 'global' organization is partiallyillustrated:[ - gL tazce, aag...- gl.

Since LFshave well-defined semantic, lexical and syntactic real-izations, (it) is provided by our representation.
I  thissection, we address (i); and more precisely:?
how discourse structure relations are defined inlexical resources,Inters i tuat lonal  Layer.
The intersituational l yercontains feature specifications for the realization of re-lations between predicates.
For example, of the CAU-SATION relation between ACTOR's performance of thesituation SHOOTING (verbalized, e.g., by \[to\] shoot orby \[to\] take a shot) and the state of ACTEE after thesituation (\[to\] be dead); of the CONDITION relation be-tween ACTOR's preparing the INSTRUMENT for func-tioning and ACTOR's performing of the situation (as,e.g., instantiated by \[to\] charge and \[to \] shoot; etc.
Inthe following fragment, we present the specification ofthe TEMPORAL SEQUENCE relation taking SHOOTINGas reference time.
We represent the 'internal' temporaland the 'global' temporal organization of SHOOTING.As 'internal', we present its phases at the temporal?
how these relations are linked up with the rela-tions specified in the text plan.3.1 Towards  Lex ica l  D iscourse  S t ruc -tu re  Re la t ionsFor the definition of discourse structure relations inlexical resources (henceforth lexical discourse struc-ture relations), we use LF sequences.
As stated above,LF sequences (and LFs in general) are organized interms of their semantic, functional, and syntactic fea-tures.The expression of the same content via differentsyntactic patterns is an important ask in sentenceplanning (eft, e.g., \[Meteer, 1992, Vander Linden et1417th International Generation Workshop ?

7 But it is thefunctional content we associate with each LF sequence,which links t_he lexical resources up to global discoursestructure relations.Table 1 shows the functional content we associatewith some LF sequences, s For a detailed discus-sion of how the functional content of LF sequences iused to define and to structure lexical discourse rela-tions following Halliday's organization of intrasenten-tial logico-semantic relations (cf.
\[Halliday, 1985\]), see\[Wanner, 1994\].. Caus2Oper l  A (Magn o) SynV0 (as in Shecommands respect - -  I (really) think highly ofher);2.
V0  ^ because o f  o SUBJECT (as in I respecther because off her work);3.
CaussOperx  (as in Her work makes me respecther ) .The functional content of these realizations is moredetailed than that of VOLITIONAL CAUSE.
For exam-ple: 1. communicates an active role of the CAUSER; 2.- -  the active role of the ACTOR, and 3.
- -  the activerole of the SUBJECT.
Therefore, they not only realizeVOLITIONAL CAUSE, but also specify it in more detail.To summarize, the search for a lexical discoursestructure relation is done in accordance with the func-tional content, the communicative intention of thespeaker, and the contents of the arguments of the RSTrelation considered.
If  the RST relation connects un-related case frames 1?
(as, e.g., EVIDENCE in In win-ter, the days are short.
It is getting light late andearly dark) these case frames are realized indepen-dently without being connected by a lexical discoursestructure relation.
If  the case frames are related, thefollowing three variations are possible:(i) An RST relation coincides, in general, with the func-tional content of a lexical discourse structure relation;as, e.g., VOLITIONAL CAUSE in the following rudimen-tary text plan for the 'RESPECT' examples given abovedoes:3.2 Establishing the Initial LinkThe first and the most important ask in tailoring thetext plan to linguistic resources is to find lexical dis-course structure relations that correspond to RST re-lations specified in the text plan.To illustrate this task, let us consider the RSTrelation VOLITIONAL CAUSE as it holds betweenthe situation's causation and the situation itself.The corresponding function in our model is causa lenhancement.
Apart from the LF sequence Caus  AV0 given in the table above (in the cluster of RESPECT,instantiated, e.g., by An old tradition requires children4o show respect for their parents), at least the followingthree also function as causa l  enhancement: 9rClosely related to this topic is the task of 'compacting' theinformation to be corv_mtmJcated' (sometimes called 'aggrega-tlon' \[Hovy, 1993\]).STl~s is not to say that these functions are the only onesthat are possible.9 The Syn function provides asynonym expression; the Causindices '2' and '3' stand for 'causation by ACTEE' and 'causationby the SUBJECT', respectively.
(R2 /V0L IT IONAL CAUSE:cause (NORK/ SITUATION: actor (PERSON: sex  female:name #unknoen#): ob l igatory - ro les  (: actor) ):act ion (RESPECT/ SITUATION: senser (PERSON: speaker +): phenomenon (PERSON: sex  female:name #unknown#): ob l igatory - ro les  ( : senser,:phenomenon, : s i tuat ion) ) )I f  so, the subclassification of the lexical relation deter-mines its final realization.
(it) An RST relation instantiation subsumes everaldistinct classes of lexical discourse structure relations;as, e.g., the instantiation of the RST relation CON-TRAST in the text plan below (this plan is also highlysimplified):1?Case frames are considered to be unrelated if between themor one of their roles no identity, is-a, causer, location, etc.
re-lation holds.1427th International Generation Workshop ?

(iii) An  RUT relation is not captured by our taxonomy(as, e.g., CONCESSION).
Then, the corresponding caseframes are treated as unrelated (see above).4 Related WorkOne of the first proposals for how to take linguisticresources into account during the process of text plan-ning was Danlos' Discourse Grammar \[Danlos, 1987\],where acceptable clause pattern sequences were pre-sented explicitly.
The basic difference between Dan-los' work and ours is that in the Discourse Gram-mar, clause pattern sequences are represented as con-crete valency schemata while in our model, they arerepresented as functional distinctions that encode se-quences of LFS.
~S a result, we do not face the prob-lem of being restricted to a concrete small domain asDanlos does.Meteer's text planner \[Meteer, 1992\] is another pro-posal for the organization of lexical resources thatincorporate lexically biased discourse relations.
Butwhile we argue that lexically biased discourse rela-tions are to be realized by a functionally motivatedlexical choice model, Meteer sugggests a single struc-turally motivated model for text planning, which alsosubsumes lexical choice.Further, for example, \[Rubinoff, 1992\] ensures theexpressability of discourse relations provided by a con-ventional text planner by annotating linguistic struc-tures.
Dob~ and Novak \ [Dob~ and Novak, 1992\] useRST structure relations and the Ted Structure repre-sentation proposed by Meteer in parallel: via RST rela-tions, the content selection and discourse organizationis done; the representation f the arguments of the RSTrelations chosen in terms of Tezt Structures ensuresthe linguistic realization and provides constraints forthe guidance of the process of content selection anddiscourse organization.
\[Vander Linden et at., 1992\]suggest subclausal RUT relations for sentence organi-zation.
Neither Dob~ and Novak nor Vander Lindenet al address lexical phenomena explicitly, however.Elhadad's proposal \[Elhadad, 1992\] to use Topoi(i.e.
inference rules that encode relations betweenpropositions incorporating lexical material) as dis-course structure relations is aimed at exploiting lex-ical phenomena for discourse organization.
Elhadadfocuses, however, on the 'argumentative potential' oflexical items rather than on a comprehensive model oflexical resources.5 Concluding RemarksIn this paper, we argued that in order to build upthe link between discourse structure relations in thetext plan and linguistic resources, it is useful to dis-tinguish between two levels of discourse organization:a global discourse organization, which is not affectedby linguistic means; and a finer discourse organiza-tion, which is clone in accordance with the linguisticmateriM that is available for the meaning communi-cated.
We reported on an ongoing attempt to definea situation-specific, multilayered model of lexical re-sources that is based on Mel'~uk's Lezical Functions.We have shown that the lexical phenomena repre-sented at the most global layer of this model are suit-able to serve as lexically biased discourse relations,and that these relations can be tailored to relations asspecified in the output of an RST style text planner.The following distinctive features characterize themodel proposed:?
it makes sure that all relations defined are ex-pressable in language,* it allows for a realization of lexical relations as in-traclausal relations between discourse segments,?
it is sensitive to lexical and syntactic variationsduring the realization of discourse relations.Although we decompose the LF information and re-present it in a systemic framework, we think that wehave shown that LFS as introduced in MTT can be usedas constraints not only at the level of words (as arguedin \[Meteer, 1991, p. 302\]).
However, it should also benoted that the proposal we suggest works only if thearguments of a discourse relation communicate infor-mation on the same situation or on related situations.AcknowledgementsMany thanks are due to John Bateman for reading thevarious versions of this paper and for the long (phone)1437th International Generation Workshop ?
