esAbstractThis paper presents a gratmnar andstyle checker demonstrator for Span-ish and Greek native writers devel-oped within the project GramCheck.Besides a brief grmnmar error typol-ogy for Spanish, a linguistically moti-vated approach to detection and diag-nosis is presented, based on the gen-eralized use of PROLOG extensionsto highly typed unification-based gram-mars.
The demonstrator, currently in-cluding flfll coverage for agreement er-rors and certain head-argmnent relationissues, also provides correction by meansof an analysis-transfer-synthesis cycle.Finally, fltture extensions to the (:urrentsystem are discussed.1 In t roduct ionGrammar checking stelnmed as a logical appli-cation from forlner attelni)ts to natural language.ulMerstanding by comtmters.
Many of the NLUsystems developed in the 70's indu(le(l a kind oferror recovery Inechanisln ranging flom the treat-ment only of spelling e.rrors, PARRY (1)arkin -son c't al., 1977), to tile inclusion also of incom-plete int)ut containing some kind of ellipsis, LAD-DEll,/LIFEll (Hendrix et al, 1977).The interest in the 80's begun to turn consid-ering grammar checking as an enterprise of itsown right (Carbonell & Hayes, 1983), (Ilayes &Mouradian, 1981), (Heidorn et al, 1982), (.lensenat al., 1983), though many of the approacheswere still in I;t1(: NLU tradition ((\]harniak, 198a),(Granger, 1983), (Kwasny & Sondheimer, 1981),(Weischedel & Black, \]980), (Weisehedel & Sond-heimer, 1983).
A 1985 Ovum report on nal;ll-ral language applications (.lohnson, 1985) alreadyidentifies grammar and style checking as one ofthe seven major apt)lications of NLP.
Currently,every project in grammar checking has as its goalthe creation of a writing aid rather than a robustman-machine interface (Adriaens, 1994), (lloliolictal .
,  1992), (Vosse, 1992).Current systems dealillg with grammatical de-viance have be(m inainly involve(t in the integi~>don of special techniques to detect and correct,when possible, these, deviances.
In some case.s,these have be.en incorporated to traditional pars-ing techniques, as it is the case with feature re-laxation in the context of unification-based for-malisms (Bolioli et al, 1992), or the addition of aset of catching error rules si)ecially handling thedeviant constructions (Thurlnair, 1990).
In othereases, the relaxation component has heen includedas a new add-in feature to the parsing algoril,hm,as in the IBM's PLNL I '  aI)proach (Heidorn et al,1982), or in the work developed for tim Tra.nsla-tor's Workbench t)roject using the METAL MT-system (TWB, 1992).Besides, an increasing concern in currentprojects is that of linguistic relevance of the anal-ysis t)erformed by the grammar correction system.In this sense, the adequate integration of errordetection and correction techniques within main-stream grammm" formalisms has l)een addressedby a nunl|)er of these projects (\[Iolioli eta/., 1992),(Vosse, 1992), ((\]enthia.l ctal., t992), (O(~uthial etal., 1994).l~bllowing this concern, this paper presents re-suits fl'om the project GramCheck (A Gram-mar and Style Checker, MLAP93-11), flmded bythe CEC.
GramCheck has developed a grammarchecker demonstrator for Spanish and Greek na-tive writers using ALEP (ET6/1, 1991), (Simp-kins, 1994) as the NLP development platform, aclient-server architeeUlre as implenmnted in theX Windows system, Motif as the 'look ~md fe, el'interface and Xminfo as the kllowh!dge t)ase, stor-age format.
Generalized use of extensions to thehighly typed and unifi(:ation based formalism im-i)Iemented in ALEP has been 1)erformed.
Theseextensions (called Constraint Solvers, CSs) arenothing but pieces of PR()I,OG code l)erforlningdifferent l)oolean and relational operations overfeature wdues.
Besides, GramCheck has usedongoing results Dora LS-GRAM (LRE61029), aproject alining at the implementation of middle175coverage ALEP grammars for a number of Euro-pean languages.The demonstrator checks whether a documentcontains grammar errors or style weaknesses and,if found any, users are provided with messages,suggestions and, for grammar errors only, auto-inatic correction(s).2 Brief grammar error typologyfor SpanishThe linguistic statements made by developers ofcurrent grammar checkers based on NLP ted>niques are often contradictory egarding the typesof errors that grammar checkers must correct au-tomatically.
(Veronis, 1988) claims that nativewriters are unlikely to produce errors involvingmorphological features, while (Vosse, 1992) ac-ce.t)ts uch morpho-syntactic errors, in spite of tilefact that an examination of texts by the authorrevealed that their appearance in native writer'stexts is not frequent.
Both authors agree in char-acterizing morpho-syntactic errors as a sainple oflack of competence.On the other hand, an examination of real textsproduced by Spanish writers revealed that they doproduce morpho-syntactic errors I .
Spanish is aninflectiolml anguage, which increases the possi-bilities of such exrors.
Nevertheless, other errorsrelated to structural configuration of the languageark: produced as well.Errors found fall into one of the following sub-types, assuming that featurization is the techniqueused in t)arsing sentences:1.
Mislnatching of features that do It(it af-fect representational issues (intra- or inter-syntactic agreement on gender, number, per-son and cask' for categories showing thisphenonmnon).
These mismatchings producerto~?,- St'l"ttct~K/'ttl e7"l'O~'S.2.
Mismatching of fl:atures which describe cer-tain representational properties for cate-gories, as wrong head-argument relations,word order and substitution of certain cat-egories.
These mismatchings produce struc-tural errors.Table 1 shows rite percentages of diflhrent ypesof errors tbund in the corpus.
Punctuation errorsmust be considered as structural violations, whilefor style weaknesses, it depends on its subtype.Errors at the lexical level are diflh:ult to classit~yand itios(; of them must regaMed as spelling ratherthan gralnlnar errors.
The nu ln l )e r  o f  e r ro I s  iden-tiffed in this corpus is 543.

are susceptible of keystroke rrors-, can influence the final decision.
Finally, for caseswhere equal scores are obtained, as it happenswith a non-inherent masculine noun and a fen>inine determiner, both possible corrections houldbe pertbrmed, since there is not enough informa-tion so as to decide the correct value (unless thiscan be obtained from other agreeing elements inthe sentence - - for  instance an attribute to thisNP).Basically, the final operation to be per formedwith the scores is to determine that the higher thescore of an element the severer its substitution.Thus,  scores are clues for the correction of thoseelements having the lowest scores.The  initialization steps in order to per form theheuristic technique are related to the assignmentof values and  scores to lexical projections depend-ing on its inherentness.
The  values for genderand  number  of the head of the projection serveas a parameter  for the computat ion  of values andscores for the possible modifier which could ap-pear closed to it.
Note that; agreement in Span-ish is based on a binary value system.
Thus, thecomputation of values for the modifier of a givenhead simply relies on the instantiation of oppositevalues to those of the head.
In the case of under-specification of the head for gender, for instance,the presupposition is that this value is the sameas the one of the modifier, if this is not under-specified.
Otherwise, both elements remain un-derspecified.
Besides, the weight given to control-ling elements (50) ensures that there is no way formodifiers to overpass this score.
Note as well thatthe weight given to inherentless values, as number(10), ensures that there are no promoted elementsin this calculation.
The following schematic CSillustrates the assignment of scores:and(=(Score'number'head,10),and(or (and ( :  (lnherm~t~ess'head,yes), = (Score'gender'head,50)),~u~d(= (lnherel~tness'head,no), (Score'gender'head, 10))),=(Score'ntmlher'mod,0)))The following steps to be performed by CSs arerelated to the addition of all those scores associ-ated to a given value in the successive rules build-ing the nominal prbjection and the percolation ofmorphosyntaetic features:or(and(or( : ( ( lender 'head'mother ,Oendcr 'mod) ,- -(Gendcr'mod,mase'fem)),and(num'add(MG\]gN 'SCOI,tF,'H I,\]A D,MGEN'SCORE'MOI) ,M(~ EN'SCORE'  MOTI IP, I{),and(= (Gender'mod'head,( lender 'mod'mother) ,hum'add (It (I EN'SCO l/,\]'Y 11EAD,HGEN'SOOII,E'MOD,IlGEN'SCORE'MOTI\[EII~)))),a l ld(=(Gender 'nmd,Gender 'mod'head),and (nu re'add (H GEN'SCO I{E'ftEA I),MCIEN'SCORE'MOD,HGEN'SOORE'MOTI IER) ,and(=(Gender 'mod'head,Gendcr 'mod'mothcr) ,num'add(MGEN'SCORE'HEAD,HGEN'SCOR,  I~ 'MOD,MGEN'SCOI~E'MOTHER)))))The final evahlation performed by CSs isdone when categories howing agreement over-pass their maximal projection, only if no otherinter-syntagmatic agreement must be taken intoaccount (as it is the case with subject-attributeagreement, for instance).
Postponing in thisway the final ewfluation ensures that the CS willtake into account all the previous parameters togive an appropriate diagnosis about the completeXP containing the agreement violation.
Thisevaluation is based on the comparison of scoresby means of the 'greater than' predicate in or-der to determine (a) the correct wflue for thefeature(s) checked corresponding to the highestscore(s) (Right_Gender, Right_Number in the ex-ample below), to be used by the transfer module,and (b) the error diagnosis (gender, number andgender_number below), to be used by the errorhandling module that will display appropriate r-ror information to the user:178and(or(or (and (mun'gt  (I 1 (I EN'S CO 1/.1,'" NO l \] N, M ('I,;NN (\]() It.I,;' N O U N),=:((-lender' N ram, lt lght'  (hulder)),and (nuln' gl,(M C I'\]N'H(X) 11 E" N O U N,I 1 (I |,\]N'F,C\]O|I\]",' N O I l N),~ (( lender' Mod,night.'

que., less ...than) whose second term is introduced by the con-jun(:tion q*u', producing phrases uch as *i'~@riorq'ae instead of i'nferior a.
With the verb relacionar'(to relate), something similar occurs: t;his verbsulmatcgorizes for t,he preposition con; however,due.
to the fact; that there exists tilt: prel)ositionalmulti-word units ~:n rclo, cidn a an(l c'n r('.lac.idncon, st)eakers tend to think that the same 1)ret)osi-I;ional alternation can be 1)crfornm(t with tin,.

Both pat;--terns are in a complementary distribution.
Thisway, structural errors can be foreseen and con-trolled, and the systeln is provi(led with a mech-anism which establishes the way rule constraintsl nus t  }to re}axed.To cope with this error, a CS operating on lists(:he(ks whether the prel)osition in 1;tlo (:onstitu(mtattached to the predicative sign belongs to thehead of the list or to the tail.

Errors Oil portmanteau words (use.
de el, a elinstead of del, a O.Regarding style issues, three different types ofweaknesses are detected: structural weaknesses,lexical weaknesses and abusive use of passive,gerunds and rammer adverbs.
While structuralweaknesses are detected in tim phrase structurerules using CSs (noun + "a" + infinitive), bymeans of an error anticipation strategy, lexicalweaknesses arc detected at the lexical level, withno st)octal mechanisms other than simple CSs.Lexieal errors currently detected are related withthe use of Latin words which it is better to avoid,foreign words with Spanish deriwttion, cognitiveerl'ors, foreign words for which a Spanish word isrecommended and verbosity.5 Further developmentsi{,esults obtained with the cmTent demonst;ratorare very promising.
The performance of the sys-tem using CSs is similm' to that shown widloutthem, hence its us(; in conjunction with the detec-tion techniques proposed, rather than a burden,may be seen as a means to add robustness to NLPsystems.
In fact, CSs may provide more naturalsolutions to grammar implemental;ion issues, likePP-attachmel l t  control.Several directions for further developments havea\]ready been defined.
These include the integra-tion of these grammar checking techniques intothe final release of the LS-GRAM Spanish gram-mar, which will have a more realistic coverage illterms both of linguistic i)henomena nd lexicon.Besides, on this new version of the grammar, hy-brid teehniques will be used, taking advantage ofthe preproco.ssing facilities included in ALEP.
Inparticular, while for errors like those presented inthis paper the approach adopted is linguisticallymotivated, for certain imnctuation errors (or sim-ply ill order to reduce lexi(:al arab*girl(y) otherrelatively simple iHeailS C~Lli be defined that ill-chide (:ertain extended pattern ma.tching on reg-ular expressions or the passing of linguist*(: in-formation gathered in a t)reproeessing phase tothe unifh:ation-bas('.d parser.
