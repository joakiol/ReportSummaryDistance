The LUNA corpus will be an-notated at multiple levels to include an-notations of syntactic, semantic, and dis-course information; specialized annotationtools will be used for the annotation at eachof these levels.
In order to synchronize thesemultiple layers of annotation, the PAULAstandoff exchange format will be used.
Inthis paper, we present the corpus and itsPAULA-based architecture.11 IntroductionXML standoff markup (Thompson and McKelvie,1997; Dybkj?r et al, 1998) is emerging as the clean-est way to organize multi-level annotations of cor-pora.
In many of the current annotation efforts basedon standoff a single multi-purpose tool such as theNITE XML Toolkit (Carletta et al, 2003) or Word-Freak (Morton and LaCivita, 2003) is used to anno-1The members of the LUNA project consortium are: Pied-mont Consortium for Information Systems (IT), University ofTrento (IT), Loquendo SpA (IT), RWTH-Aachen (DE), Uni-versity of Avignon (FR), France Telecom R&D Division S.A.(FR), Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology (PL)and the Institute for Computer Science of the Polish Academyof Sciences (PL), http://www.ist-luna.eu.This research was performed in the LUNA project funded by theEC, DG Infso, Unit E1 and in the Collaborative Research Cen-ter 632 ?Information Structure?, funded by the German ScienceFoundation, http://www.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de.tate as well as maintain all annotation levels (cf.
theSAMMIE annotation effort (Kruijff-Korbayova?
et al,2006b)).However, it is often the case that specialized toolsare developed to facilitate the annotation of particu-lar levels: examples include tools for segmentationand transcription of the speech signal like PRAAT(Boersma and Weenink, 2005) and TRANSCRIBER(Barras et al, 1998), the SALSA tools for FrameNet-style annotation (Burchardt et al, 2006), and MMAX(Mu?ller and Strube, 2003) for coreference annota-tion.
Even in these cases, however, it may still beuseful, or even necessary, to be able to visualizemore than one level at once, or to ?knit?
together2multiple levels to create a file that can be used totrain a model for a particular type of annotation.The Linguistic Annotation Framework by (Ide et al,2003) was proposed as a unifying markup format tobe used to synchronize heterogeneous markup for-mats for such purposes.In this paper, we discuss how the PAULA represen-tation format, a standoff format inspired by the Lin-guistic Annotation Framework, is being used to syn-chronize multiple levels of annotation in the LUNAcorpus, a corpus of spoken dialogues in multiple lan-guages and multiple domains that is being created tosupport the development of robust spoken languageunderstanding models for multilingual dialogue ser-vices.
The corpus is richly annotated with linguisticinformation that is considered relevant for researchon dialogue, including chunks, named entities, argu-ment structure, coreference, and dialogue acts.
Wechose to adopt specialized tools for each level: e.g.,2In the sense of the knit tool of the LT-XML suite.148transcription using TRANSCRIBER, coreference us-ing MMAX, attributes using SEMANTIZER, etc.
Tosynchronize the annotation and allow cross-layer op-erations, the annotations are mapped to a commonrepresentation format, PAULA.The structure of the paper is as follows.
In Sec-tion 2, we present the LUNA project and the LUNAcorpus with its main annotation levels.
In Section 3,we introduce the PAULA exchange format, focusingon the representation of time alignment and dialoguephenomena.
Finally we show how PAULA is used inthe LUNA corpus and discuss alternative formats.2 The LUNA projectThe aim of the LUNA project is to advance the stateof the art in understanding conversational speechin Spoken Dialogue Systems (Gupta et al, 2005),(Bimbot et al, 2006).Three aspects of Spoken Language Understand-ing (SLU) are of particular concern in LUNA: gen-eration of semantic concept tags, semantic compo-sition into conceptual structures and context sensi-tive validation using information provided by the di-alogue manager.
In order to train and evaluate SLUmodels, we will create an annotated corpus of spo-ken dialogues in multiple domains and multiple lan-guages: French, Italian, and Polish.2.1 The LUNA corpusThe LUNA corpus is currently being collected, witha target to collect 8100 human-machine dialoguesand 1000 human-human dialogues in Polish, Italianand French.
The dialogues are collected in the fol-lowing application domains: stock exchange, hotelreservation and tourism inquiries, customer supportservice/help-desk and public transportation.2.2 Multilevel annotationSemantic interpretation involves a number of sub-tasks, ranging from identifying the meaning of indi-vidual words to understanding which objects are be-ing referred to up to recovering the relation betweendifferent semantic objects in the utterance and dis-course level to, finally, understanding the commu-nicative force of an utterance.In some annotation efforts?e.g., in the annotationof the French MEDIA Corpus (Bonneau-Maynardand Rosset, 2003)?
information about the meaningof semantic chunks, contextual information aboutcoreference, and information about dialogue acts areall kept in a single file.
This approach however suf-fers from a number of problems, including the factthat errors introduced during the annotation at onelevel may make other levels of annotation unusableas well, and that it is not possible for two anno-tators to work on different types of annotation forthe same file at the same time.
Most current an-notation efforts, therefore, tend to adopt the ?multi-level?
approach pioneered during the developmentof the MAPTASK corpus and then developed as partof work on the EU-funded MATE project (McKelvieet al, 2001), in which each aspect of interpreta-tion is annotated in a separate level, independentlymaintained.
This approach is being followed, forinstance, in the ONTONOTES project (Hovy et al,2006) and the SAMMIE project (Kruijff-Korbayovaet al, 2006a).For the annotation of the LUNA corpus, we de-cided to follow the multilevel approach as well.
Thatallows us to achieve more granularity in the anno-tation of each of the levels and to investigate moreeasily dependencies between features that belong todifferent levels.
Furthermore, we can use differentspecialized off-the-shelf annotation tools, splittingup the annotation task and thus facilitating consis-tent annotation.2.3 Annotation levelsThe LUNA corpus will contain different types of in-formation.
The first levels are necessary to preparethe corpus for subsequent semantic annotation, andinclude segmentation of the corpus in dialogue turns,transcription of the speech signal, and syntactic pre-processing with POS-tagging and shallow parsing.The next level consists of the annotation of do-main information using attribute-value pairs.
Thisannotation will be performed on all dialogues in thecorpus.The other levels of the annotation scheme are notmandatory, but at least a part of the dialogues willbe annotated in order to investigate contextual as-pects of the semantic interpretation.
These levels in-clude the predicate structure, the relations betweenreferring expressions, and the annotation of dialogueacts.1492.3.1 Segmentation and transcription of thespeech signalBefore transcription and annotation can begin, itis necessary to segment the speech signal into dia-logue turns and annotate them with speaker identityand mark where speaker overlap occurs.
The goalof this segmentation is to be able to perform a tran-scription and annotation of the dialogue turns withor without dialogue context.
While dialogue contextis preferable for semantic annotation, it slows downthe annotation process.The tool we will use for the segmentation andtranscription of the speech signal is the open sourcetool TRANSCRIBER3 (Barras et al, 1998).The next step is the transcription of the speechsignal, using conventions for the orthographic tran-scription and for the annotation of non-linguisticacoustic events.2.3.2 Part Of Speech Tagging and ChunkingThe transcribed material will be annotated withPOS-tags, morphosyntactic information like agree-ment features, and segmented based on syntacticconstituency.For the POS-tags and morphosyntactic features,we will follow the recommendations made in EA-GLES (EAGLES, 1996), which allows us to have aunified representation format for the corpus, inde-pendently of the tools used for each language.2.3.3 Domain Attribute AnnotationAt this level, semantic segments will be anno-tated following an approach used for the annotationfor the French MEDIA dialogue corpus (Bonneau-Maynard and Rosset, 2003).We specify the domain knowledge in domain on-tologies.
These are used to build domain-specificdictionaries.
Each dictionary contains:?
Concepts corresponding to classes of the ontol-ogy and attributes of the annotation.?
Values corresponding to the individuals of thedomain.?
Constraints on the admissible values for eachconcept.3http://trans.sourceforge.netThe concept dictionaries are used to annotate se-mantic segments with attribute-value pairs.
The se-mantic segments are produced by concatenation ofthe chunks produced by the shallow parser.
A se-mantic segment is a unit that corresponds unambigu-ously to a concept of the dictionary.

Some of them are based upon syntac-tic structure, with PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer,2003) being one of the most relevant, building theannotation upon the syntactic representation of theTreeBank corpus (Marcus et al, 1993).
An alter-native to syntax-driven approaches is the annotationusing semantic roles as in FrameNet (Baker et al,1998).For the annotation of predicate structure in theLUNA corpus, we decided to use a FrameNet-likeapproach, rather than a syntax-based approach:1.
Annotation of dialogue interaction has to dealwith disfluencies, non-complete sentences, un-grammaticality, etc., which complicates the useof deep syntactic representations.2.
If we start from a syntactic representation, wehave to follow a long way to achieve the seman-tic interpretation.
Syntactic constituents mustbe mapped to ?-roles, and then to semanticroles.
FrameNet offers the possibility of anno-tating using directly semantic criteria.4Good morning, you can register for the exam or obtain in-formation.
How can I help you?150For each domain, we define a set of frames.
Theseframes are defined based on the domain ontology,with the named entities providing the frame ele-ments.
For all the frames we introduce the negationas a default frame element.For the annotation, first of all we annotate the en-tities with a frame and a frame element.Then if the target is overtly realized we make apointer from the frame elements to the target.
Thenext step is putting the frame elements and the target(if overtly realized) in a set.

This schemehas been extensively tested with dialogue corporaand includes instructions for annotating a variety ofanaphoric relations, including bridging relations.
Afurther reason is the robustness of the scheme thatdoesn?t require one single interpretation in the an-notation.The first step is the annotation of the informationstatus of the markables with the tags given andnew.
If the markables are annotated with given,the annotator will select the most recent occurrenceof the object and add a pointer to it.
If the mark-able is annotated with new, we distinguish betweenmarkables that are related to a previously mentionedobject (associative reference) or don?t have such arelation.If there are alternative interpretations, which of alist of candidates can be the antecedent, the annota-tor can annotate the markable as ambiguous andadd a pointer to each of the possible antecedents.

Eachset of frame elements will correspond to an utter-ance.Each utterance will be annotated using a multi-dimensional annotation scheme partially based onthe DAMSL scheme (Allen and Core, 1997) and onthe proposals of ICSI-MRDA (Dhillon et al, 2004).We have selected nine dialogue acts from theDAMSL scheme as initial tagset, that can be extendedfor the different application domains.
Each utter-ance will be annotated with as many tags as applica-ble.

and has been de-veloped for the representation of data annotated atmultiple layers.
The application scenario is sketchedin Fig 1: researchers use multiple, specialized off-the-shelf annotation tools, such as EXMARALDA orMMAX, to enrich data with linguistic information.The tools store the data in tool-specific formats and,hence, it is not straightforward to combine informa-tion from different sources and, e.g., to search forcorrelations across multiple annotation layers.This is where PAULA comes in: PAULA mapsthe tool-specific formats to a common format andserves as an interchange format between thesetools.6 Moreover, the annotations from the differentsources are merged into one single representation.PAULA makes this data available for further appli-cations, such as searching the data by means of thetool ANNIS7, or to feed statistical applications likeWEKA8.PAULA is an XML-based standoff format for lin-guistic annotations, inspired by the ?dump format?6Currently, we provide PAULA import filters for the follow-ing tools and formats: Exmaralda, MMAX, RST Tool/URML,annotate/TIGER XML.
Export from PAULA to the tool formatsis at present supported for the original source format only.
Weplan to support the export of selected annotations to other tools.This is, however, not a trivial task since it may involve loss ofinformation.7ANNIS: http://www.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/annis8WEKA: http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/wekaFigure 1: PAULA annotation scenarioof the Linguistic Annotation Framework (Ide et al,2003).9 With PAULA, not only is the primary dataseparated from its annotations, but individual anno-tation layers (such as parts of speech and dialogueacts) are separated from each other as well.
Thestandoff approach allows us to mark overlappingsegments in a straightforward way: by distributingannotations over different files (XML as such doesnot easily account for overlapping segments, sinceits object model is a hierarchical, tree-like structure).Moreover, new annotation layers can be added eas-ily.PAULA assumes that a representation of the pri-mary data is stored in a file that optionally spec-ifies a header with meta information, followed bya tag <body>, which contains a representation ofthe primary data.

The first markable, with the IDtok1, specifies the span that starts at character po-sition 1 and is of length 10: buongiorno.
Simi-larly, the speakers?
individual turns are specified bythe ?Turn?
markables.
Here, the first markable (IDturn1) specifies the entire dialogue turn of the firstspeaker (which corresponds to the part marked inlight grey within the text file).
Additionally, themarkable encodes the time range that is occupied bythat turn: it starts at time point 21.098, and ends attime point 29.272.Markables represent a special kind of annotation:they mark linguistic units.
The actual annotation,though, specifies properties of these units, such aspart of speech or dialogue acts.
For the encodingof these properties, PAULA provides <feat>elements, which point to <mark> elements by ref-erencing their IDs.
Token markables are annotatedby ?Morph?
and ?POS?
features.
The name of theannotated feature is specified by the attribute typeof the <featList> element; the value of the fea-ture is given by the attribute value of the <feat>elements.
For instance, the token with ID tok15is annotated with morph="1.comm.sing"and pos="PR".
Similarly, the Turn markablesare specified for the speakers uttering the turns(?Speaker?
features), and details of the dialogueacts (?Action?)
are given.
The file with the dialogueact annotations specify multiple features within onetag <feat>, rather than distributing the featuresover several files, as we do in the case of morphol-ogy and POS annotations.
This way, we explicitelyencode the fact that the individual annotations(action="inscription obtain-info"and objectDB="examen") jointly form onecomplex annotation.PAULA markables can also refer to points or ar-eas within pictures or videos (by referring to co-ordinates) or point to other markables (Fig.
2 doesnot illustrate these options).
Moreover, for the en-coding of hierarchical structures like graphs, PAULAprovides <struct> (structure) elements (see Fig.
3below for an example).The PAULA standoff format is a generic formatthat does not necessarily prescribe in detail how torepresent annotations.
Often there is more than oneway to represent the data in PAULA standoff format.In the next section, we present the way we intendto represent dialogue data, which involve possiblyoverlapping contributions by several speakers, andoften include time-alignment information.4 Representing LUNA DialogueAnnotations in PAULAIn this section, we illustrate the use of PAULA for theLUNA corpus with a more elaborated example, fo-153cusing on the representation of frame annotation.
InFig.
3, the top elements represent the dialogue turnsand the semantic units underlying the frame annota-tions, which are defined on the base of the dialogueturns.
?FrameUnit?
markables define the scope orextension of the frames, and roughly correspond toa sentence or turn.
?FrameP?
markables specify theframe participants, i.e., all elements that receive asemantic role within some frame.The annotations at the bottom contain informationabout individual frames.
The frames are encoded as<struct> elements, constituting complex objectsthat group semantic units to form frames instances.In Fig.
3, the frame with ID frame 1 consists ofthe frame unit, the lexical unit and the frame partic-ipants.
The ?FrameAnno?
box encodes the name ofthe frame: ?inscription?.
The frames can be definedby external ?Framesets?, such as FrameNet (Bakeret al, 1998), which in our example is stored in anexternal XML-resource called frameSet.xml. 						 	! " #$ %&'	 '# #%(	 	# #%(	 )	*	#%&# #%(+ , - -,&+.//..0122*30) *0	# #%(+ , - -,&+.//.

Twoof the most prominent ones are the NITE-XML1010NITE: http://http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/NITEand the ELAN11 format.
Similar to PAULA, NITE-XML focuses on richly annotated corpus data.
Itcomes with a rich data model and employs a richmeta specification, which determines?based uponthe individual corpus characteristics?
the concretelinearization of the respective XML representation.Furthermore, it is accompanied by a JAVA API anda query tool, forming a valuable toolkit for corpusengineers who can adapt available resources to theirspecific needs.
The ELAN format is used by a familyof tools developed primarily for language documen-tation, of which the most advanced one is ELAN, arobust, ready-to-use tool for multi-level annotationof video.
Its underlying data model is the AbstractCorpus Model (ACM) (Brugman and Russel, 2004).PAULA aims at an application scenario differentfrom both of these formats.
First, it builds upon theusage of specialized off-the-shelf annotation toolsfor the variety of annotation tasks.
Both the NITE-XML and ELAN approaches require additional effortand skills from the user, to add the required function-ality, which PAULA aims to avoid.
Second, PAULAtakes care of merging the annotations from differentsources, which is not in focus of ELAN or NITE.6 Discussion and Future DirectionsWe presented the LUNA dialogue corpus and its rep-resentation format, the standoff exchange formatPAULA.In contrast to other formats, PAULA focuses onan application scenario in which different annota-tions come in their own specific format and are tobe merged into one corpus representation.
This in-cludes, for instance, the use of specialized off-the-shelf annotation tools for specific annotation tasks,as well as distributed and incremental annotation.The creation of the LUNA dialogue corpus is a pro-totypical example for this scenario.However, the usefulness of a format also dependson its interoperability and the available tools.
Withits import filters, PAULA already serves the needs oflinguists of different linguistic communities, whilemore export functionality is still to be integrated.With the export to WEKA, a first step in this direc-tion is done.
Furthermore, ANNIS ?a web-based toolfor visualizing and searching complex multi-level11ELAN: http://www.lat-mpi.eu/tools/elan154annotations?
is available and will be developed fur-ther.In our next steps, we will focus on a deliberateextension of the PAULA format for further and morecomplex dialogue annotations, which will enable theuse of PAULA as an exchange format also in this do-main.ReferencesJ.
