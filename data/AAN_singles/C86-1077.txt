%'he re la t ionsh ip  between buman and machineThe complex i ty  of the t rans la t ion  task, andthe dlver.~:kty of the knowledge types invo lved ,makes  the  imp lementat ion  of all MT  sys tem aresearch  prob lem in knowledge eng ineer ing .
Ino rder  fo r  in termed ia te  resu l t s  to  be ofp ract l ca l  va lue ,  it  is necessary  to in tegratehuman exper t i se  in to  the  mach ine  t rans la t ionprocess .
A f te r  th i s  input ,  the  mach ine 'sknowledge must  be complete ,  adequate  fo rcar ry ing  out a l l  later  stages in the t rans la t ionchain.
Three s t ra teg ies  are recogn ized  for thisinvo lvement ,  pos t -ed i t lng ,  p re -ed i t  ing, andin teract ive  t rans la t ion  (see further Whi te lock(ed.)
1985).Of  these  three  s t ra teg ies ,  pos t -ed i tedt rans la t ion  is obv ious ly  the safest; the humanhas  the  f ina l  say,  and  so  can  cor rect  anyt rans la t ion  e, rrors made by tile machine.
However,?
tile post -ed~tor  must  be exper t  in the  sourcelanguage (at leas t  for  the  text - type) ,  ta rgetlanguage,  and  sub jec t  inatter, i.e.
a competentt rans la tor  in h i s /her  own right.
The major i ty  ofcurrent  mach ine  t rans la t ion  systems are of thistype - it has proved  to be cost e f fec t ive  - butpost -ed i t ing  is both  revet i t i ve  and to ta l lyind ispensable .
Current  in teract ive  systems, too,typ ica l ly  requ i re  a h igh  degree  of  b i l ingua lcompetence on the humen's part.The pre -ed i t ing  opt ion  assumes input wh ichhas  been  e i ther  d ra f ted  or  ed i ted  to use  on ly  ares t r i c ted  sub<language.
Desp i te  i t sdemonst ra ted  ut i l i ty  (e.g.
Meteo  (Cheva l ie r  etal.
1978), Xerox  Syst ran  (Ruf f ino  1982)), it iso f ten  v iewed as a poor  a l te rnat ive ,  convey ingconnotat ions  of severe  res t r i c t ions  on input.
Webe l ieve  that  the not ion  of p re -ed i t ing  shou ld  bereexamined in  the  l ight  of  Kay's  remark  thatmach ine  t rans la t ion  :is in p r inc ip le  poss ib leon ly  between fo rmal  languages  (fn 1).
Any  MTsys tem wi l l  p roduce  in te l l ig ib le  output  f romon ly  a proper  subset  of  texts  in what  is c la imed?
to be the  source  language.
T rans la t ion  of anatura l  language in its ent i re ty  is an i l l usorygoa l .
I f  the  par t i cu la r  subset  wh ich  can  beautomat ica l ly  t rans la ted  is not  fo rmal i sedindependent l  V of its ins tant ia t ion  as a computersystem, the ent i re  output  must  be checked aftert rans la t ion ,  in con junct ion  w i th  the  sourcetext.
We be l ieve  that it is p re ferab le  to def ineexp l i c i t l y  the  subset  of  the  source  languagetbat  the  mach ine  can  t rans la te .
Moreover ,  webe l ieve  that  the  dra f t ing  of  texts  in such  ares t r i c ted  language is an idea l  cand idate  forautomation.We have  there fore  des igned a sys tem toef fect  mono l ingua l  in teract ive  pre -ed i t ing  forp re -ed i ted  t rans la t ion ,  quest ion ing  the humanuser  about  the  source  text ,  not  about  i t st rans la t ion  (cf.
J ohnson  & Whi te lock  1985).
Anin teract ive  sys tem of th i s  type  shou ld  be ab leto accept  an adequate  subset  of g rammat ica l lywe l l - fo rmed input, query ing  the user  to reso lveambigu i t ies  o r  indeterminac ies  unt i  1 arepresentat ion  is reached which is su f f i c ient lydeta i led  and  prec ise  to  guarantee  acceptab let rans la t ion  to  a g iven  language ( fn  2).
Ai, ono l ingua l  wr i te r  can  thus  produce  f in i shedta rget  language text  w ihout  fu r ther  humanintervent ion.
As an inc identa l  benefit,  s/he canbe expected  to learn  f rom exper ience  wh ichsentence pat terns  w i l l  not be accepted and whichw i l l  g ive  many ambigu i t ies ,  and avo id  them.Indeed it  cou ld  be argued that  such  a sys tem isva luab le  even  mono l ingua l ly ,  as an ' intel l igent's ty le  checker, w i th  t rans la t ion  capab i l i ty  as aninc identa l  benefit.329Thus we do not  concur  w i th  S locum's  (\].985)assessment  of the potent ia l  of interact ion.S locum character i zes  in teract ive  mach inet rans la t ion  as "Human Ass i s ted  Mach ineTranslation" as distinct from 'full' MT, on thegrounds that the exploitat ion of the bi l ingualexpertise of a human is inter leaved with that ofthe machine.
It appears  that the mach ine  is notcar ry ing  out  the  task  of  t rans la t ionautomatically.However ,  it seems more  appropr ia te  tocons ider  the complete  cha in  of p rocesses  fromsource  language text  compos i t ion  to targetlanguage text completion.
From this perspective,any  type  of  mach ine  t rans la t ion  is humanassisted.
It is important to assess the quantityand character  of huma~ in tervent ion  as we l l  asits posit ion in the system.
A post-edlted systemres igns  i t se l f  f rom the start  to inadequacy,bu i ld ing  in the requ i rement  for (more or less)radical human revis ion of its output, so that itmight  bet ter  be ca l led  pro - t rans la t ion  thant rans la t ion  proper;  wh i le  many cur rent  pro-ed i t ing  sys tems,  a l though o f fe r ing  fu l l yautomat ic  p roduct ion  of target  language textf rom source language text, requ i re  a humancontribution in the pre-input stage, control l ingand res t r i c t ing  that  source  text,  wh ichqua l i ta t ive ly  far exceeds the demands of on- l ineinteraction (fn 3).Moreover ,  the  fu ture  o f  mach inetranslation, and natural language processing ingeneral, seems certain to lie with systems basedon A* techn iques  such as the use of in fe rencefo r  ambigu i ty  reso lu t ion .
A pr imaryconsideration wil l  be to faci l itate the transferof exper t i se  from human to machine,  by means ofmodu lar  p rogramming,  knowledge eng ineer ingtechniques, and, ultimately, machine learning.In teract ive  sys tem des ign may we l l  be the typemost  read i ly  extended to incorporate  suchtechn iques  as they are deve loped;  the forms ofin teract ion  imp lemented  for the present  humanuser can be progress ively  delegated to a virtualor mach ine  "user".
Thus desp i te  the admi t tedl imitations of interactive translat ion per se,systems including some sort of interaction offerbQth the most eff icient use of current resourcesand the most  conv inc ing  bas is  and mode l  forresearch aimed at great ly  improving translat ionquality.3.
System development toolsWi th  the  a im of p roduc ing  a too l  forcont inu ing  research  as we l l  as a sys tem ofp ract i ca l  u t i l i ty ,  we have  conce ived  ourt rans la t ion  sys tem i t se l f  and  the sys temdeve lopment  too ls  as an in tegrated  entity.Recogn is ing  a var ie ty  of types of 'user', fromend-user  to sys tem designer,  our  deve lopmentsys tem is o rgan ized  as a tree of fac i l i t ies ,where  d i f fe rent  types of user  are a l lowed oroffered access at different levels.
Faci l i t iessupported include:i) us ing  the system for writ ing,  ed i t ingand translating,2) writ ing the grammars,3) deve lop ing  the grammat ica l  theory  andthe translat ion chain,4) designing the system itself.A l l  tasks are carried out by traversing the treeunder  the gu idance  of menus.
The menu system isdes igned to a l low non-programmers  (fn 4) tospecify both the conversion of l inguistic datato menus ,  and  the  in terpretat ion  of  menucho ices .
Th is  p rov ides  the organ isat ionnecessary to control :a) d i f fe rent  v iews  of the data  bydifferent users, and330b) different processing/compilat ion ofdata according to its type.Cor respond ing  to the four types of taskgiven above, we recognise four (idealised) typesof user:1 the end user,2 theh igh- leve l  l ingu is t  (g rammarwriter),3 the low- leve l  \ ] ingu is t  (g rammardesigner),4) the system designer~They have access rights as follows:i) The  end user  w i l l  be a mono l ingua l(Eng l i sh )  techn ica l  wr i te r ,  w i th  exper tknowledge of the  techn ica l  f ie ld  and i tstermino logy,  but no knowledge of the targetlanguage.
(For deve lopment  purposes  we arework ing  w i th  extant  texts  chose*\] to be typ ica lof the i r  kind; but  the in tent ion  is to prov idethe wr i te r  w i th  a too l  for  the  in i t ia lcompos i t ion  of such texts.
The end user  w i l lthus be ab le  to respond .lore f lex ib ly  to thesystem, and make bet ter  use of its fac i l i t ies ,than we can ourselves do at the moment; althoughwe in tend it to produce  its own documentat ion.

This is impor tant  fromboth mono l ingua l  and b i l ingua l  perspect ives .Monol ingual ly,  it provides a basis for indexing,document  re t r ieva l ,  g lossary  product ion ,spe l l ing  checks etc.
B i l ingua l ly ,  in terms oft rans la t ion  into Japanese, these d is t inc t ionsmap wel l  onto orthographic conventions: generalvocabulary is represented in kanji (ideographic)script, Japanese techn ica l  vocabu lary  fromfore ign  languages  in kana ( Japanese sy l lab ic )script, and proper nouns such as procedure namesare s imply  car r ied  over  in Roman (a lphabet ic )script.2) The second level of user, the high- levellinguist, is responsible for writing the ruleswh ich  compute  we l l - fo rmed sets  of  featurespec i f i ca t ions  (e.g.
F -s t ructures)  f rom othersets, for source  language analys is ,  transfer,and target language synthesis.
A variety of ruIetypes could be provided for these purposes.
Thesystem as implemented supports the following:a) d ic t ionary  entries, wh ich  spec i fyid iosyncrat i c  in fo rmat ion  of al l  kinds.
Thesedef ine  a mapp ing  between lexemes  and(underdeterminsd)  sets  o f  featurespecifications, for analysis, and between pairsof sets of feature specifications, for transfer.b) Context - f ree  rules, augmented  inthe manner  of LFG or PATR II (Shieber 1984),that  is, regu lar  express ions  over  s t r ings  ofsets of feature  spec i f i ca t ions  (i.e.

These can be usedto  de f ine  sets  o f  features  as mutua l lyexc lus ive ,  and  to spec i fy  that  cer ta in  featureva lues  necessar i l y  fo l low from the presence orva lues  of o ther  features.e) de fau l t  .va lues  of  lex ica l  featurespec i f icat ions .f) ru les  wh ich  determine  (sur face)re la t iona l  labe ls  ,on the  bas is  o f  featurevalues.

Though la rge lysuccessful, such an approach is obviated by the332use of the s imples t  phrase  s t ructure  grammars.Conversely, expl ic it  homograph resolut ion seemsunavoidable when the system must not, under anyc i rcumstances ,  re jec t  input  as i l l - fo rmed anduntranslatable.
(fn 5)Ambiguities reso lvab le  by consideration ofthe sub-categorisat ion/valency/case patterns oflex ica l  i tems inc lude  both  lex ica l  anda t tachment  ambigui t ies ,  but not a l l  cases ofeither.
For instance:"... p rov ides  the in ter face  to the system"appears  to requ i re  domain  spec i f i c  knowledge;and"...is ach ieved  by ca l l ing  theprocedureX"requ i res  fa i r ly  soph is t i ca ted  knowledgeconcerning the re lat ive l ikel ihood of achievings state by g iv ing  an ent i ty  a par t i cu la r  name orgiving it control.The  quest ion  of  how an ambigu i ty  isreso lved  is thus a lmost  independent  of how itarises.
Even word-class ambiguities occas ional lypersist through a syntactic analysis and requireknowledge of the discourse for resolution, e.g."
load ing  ins t ruct ions  w i l l  s ta r tprocessing"A v iew of o rgan is ing  reso lu t ion  so thateach  s tage  of  p rocess ing  reso lves  theambiguities introduced by the previous stage isthus naive.In terms of interact ion,  quest ion ing  theuser too early in the translat ion chain wi l l  beunacceptab le .
The  user  must  appear  to thedisambiguator as just another knowledge source,the last to be exploited.If ambigu i t ies  are to remain  unreso lvedthrough severa l  s tages  of process ing,  compactrepresentat ions  of mul t ip le  read ings  of textsseem essent ia l .
The chart  (Kay, 1973, Mar t in  etal., 1981), and s imi lar  devices such as Tomita's(1985) 'shared packed forest' are impor tantcontributions to the solut ion of this problem.The  approach  to ambigu i ty  typ ica l  inl ingu is t i c  theory  is to a l low the grammar  toinduce it, and to t reat  the quest ion  of itscompact representation as a matter for parsing,i r re levant  to dec la rat ive  descr ipt ion.
We areinvest igat ing  the  a l te rnat ive  not ion  thatl inguistic description itself should expl ic i t lyMndeKdeterm!ne  representat ion .
An approach  tosyntactic underdetermination is that of Marcus(1985) .
We have  not  yet  examined i t sapp l i cab i l i ty  to the cur rent  task.
The 9R~\ [~semant ics  of Aronof f  (1980, see a l so  M i l le r(197--87 ~-- Wood (1985) )  is  a theory  o funderdeterminat ion  of lex ica l  entries.
Suchlexical entries become more fu l ly  determined incontext .
One might  say that  they  becomeambiguated  and reso lved  s imul taneous ly .
(\]infact, depend ing  on the use wh ich  is %o be madeof the resu l ts  of analys is ,  they may neverbecome determined.)
This approach is appl icableeven to ambiguities in major syntactic category.Then pars ing  can be cons idered  as ambiguat ingthem to the  extent  l i censed  by the phrasestructure rules and textual context.Such ideas are part icu lar ly  interesting inthe context of our system.
The GPSG-I ike featuresys tem is a means  fo r  descr ib ing  theredundancies in the lexicon; the LFG-l ike notionof mul t i - leve l  l ingu is t i c  descr ip t ion  (seel<aplan 1985) offers the possibi l i ty of ut i l is ingsuch descr ip t ions  to 'expand' the lex icon  insevera l  stages.
In our system, ambigu i t ies  insubcategor i sa t ion  behav iour  ( inc lud ing  thatbetween past  and pass ive  par t i c ip les )  do notexist during surface syntactic parsing.
We thinkof such  an i tem as be ing  a s ing le  morph-syntactic entity, but a pair of 'semantic' ones.Thi's i s  important  in t rans lat ion,  s ince theindeterminac les  o f  the  source  language may ormay not  become ambigu i t ies  in t rans la t ion .
Forexample,  the s ta te -event  ambiva lence  of pass iveparticiple,~\] in many languages  must  be recogn isedand reso lved  in t rans fer  to Japanese (though notin go ing  f rom French  to Eng l i sh ,  for  example) .For  a l ingu is t i c  descr ip t ion  of  the  sourcelanguage not to inc lude  this ambiva lence  wou ldrender  it incomplete;  for ana lys i s  to treat it,and many s imi la r  cases ,  as genu ine  ambigu i t ieswou ld  be prob lemat ic  COlnputationally,We be l ieve  that  tile invocat ion  orapp l i ca t ion  of mono l ingua l  (source) knowledge bya b i l lngua\ ]  component  is an a t t rac t ive  approachto this problem.
A good human trans\].ator infersf rom the  source  text  what  is  needed fo rt rans lat ion,  and a mach ine  system shou ld  exhib i tth i s  same, goa l -d r iven ,  behav iour .

Remark during discussion of King (1984).
Thisv iewpoint ,  of course, begs the quest ion  of theposs ib i l i ty  of human t rans la t ion ,  as P ier reI sabe l la  po in ted  out  in a fo rmal  languagec lose ly  resembl ing English.2.
We have  g lossed  over  the mat ter  of t rans ferambigu i t ies .
We assume that  these  can  beexpressed  in source  language terms forinteractive disambiguation.
In this respect, themach ine  is in a pre ferab le  pos i t ion  to that  of ahuman t rans la tor ,  who  must  in most  casesdetermine  the reso lu t ion  of such ambigu i t iesf rom the  text  a lone .
Were  our  assumpt ionincorrect ,  it wou ld  throw ser ious  doubt  on thepossibi l i ty of human translation.3.
We might even suggest that there is somethingpos i t ive ly  perverse about the assumption that amach ine  wh ich  can in i so la t ion  conver t  raw toha l f -baked (post -ed l ted)  or p re -cooked tof in i shed  text  (p re -ed i ted)  is in some waysuper io r  to one wh ich  can carry  out  the ent i reprocess  asked of it, recogn iz ing  the po ints  atwh ich  it needs  he lp  and tak ing  appropr ia teaction.4.
It shou ld  be po in ted  out here, however ,  thatwe do not  see  programming as inherent lyrad ica l ly  d i s t inc t  f rom other  types of formaldescr ipt ion.
This is par t i cu la r ly  t rue for ah igh- level  "programming language" like Prolog.5.
