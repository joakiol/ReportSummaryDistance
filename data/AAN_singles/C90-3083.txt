In spite of such phenomena, cohesion is a veryimportant idea for understanding the context correctly.In our approach, cohesive knowledge which judgescohesion between sentences is given to the system andthen  the knowledge  is used to f ind cohes ion  ind isarranged context.
I t  is also appl ied to in terpretanaphora, ellipsis and pro-forms in the context.
In orderto do so, we define the knowledge and use its definition toabstract knowledge fl'om a linguistics database almostautomatical ly.1.
In t roduct ionWhen we bui ld a machine t rans lat ion system fordialogues, we must face a lot of contextual-phenomenasuch as ellipses, anaphoras and pro-forms.
In a dialoguethese phenomena re more complicated because of manydisturbances uch as interruptions, inserted sentencesand utterance disorder.
The phenomena have not beent reated on the computer  though these phenomenain f luence the context -dependent  prob lems such asellipses, anaphoras, pro-forms and referent-transfers.
Inthis paper, we propose a context processing mechanismwhich fits for the disarranged phenomena, and describethe  l ingu is t i c  knowledge ,  ca l led  " loca l  cohes iveknowledge",  which is a const ra in t  for grasp ing  thecontextual relationship.In Sect ion 2 we wi l l  g ive examples  which arcdependent on the context and then describe the cause ofdifficulty in processing them.
In Section 3 we propose"local cohesive knowledge" and apply the mechanism in adialogue-machine translation system in Section 4.2.

Therefore  context  is compl icated.

InExample 2, the answer is a negation for the sentence, "Iwould like ...".

(3) Pro-form: in Example 4 (2), "onegaishimasu" is a pro-form and means 'We would like you to pay' in Japanese.The meaning is dependent on the context.We call processing the d i sar ranged phenomena"contextual  robustness!~".
In order to process suchphenomena, it is necessary to understand cohesion in acontext correctly.3.
l ,oeal cohes ive  knowledgeWe define cohesion in the view of computat iona ll inguist ics .
Here cohesion regu la tes  whether  twosentences are connected or not.
However it does notregulate a relationship between two sentences.
That is,cohesion is a constraint for two sentences.\ [The definition of "local cohesive knowledge"\]In our approach, "cohesion" is grasped in a contextwith "local cohesive knowledge".
It includes not only theconstraints tbr "local cohesioW~" but also its results suchas interpretations of ellipses, anaphoras, pro-forms andreferent-transfers.
Therefm'e if constraints are satisfied,the in terpreta t ions  are obta ined .
There fore  " localcohesive knowledge" has two parts,  "constra ints  forcohesion" and "inter-pretations", as follows.
(Constraints for local cohesion)= > (interpretation)t l .
Ordinar i ly ,  robustness means an ungrammat ica l ly  sentence.I lowevm' "contextual robustness" is used for the discourse level.t2.
We treat the contextual  phenomena which occur locally, thuswe use the term, "local cehcsion".1 391\[ Constra ints  \]The constra ints  are described as follows.verb l  < X1,Y1,Z1 > ,verb2 < X2,Y2,Z2 >.In the "verb l<Xl .
,Y1 ,Z l>" ,  "XI" ,  "Y I "  and "ZI"means  the case e lements of "verb1"; subjective (SUBJ),objective (OSJ) and second objective (oBJg) cases.
If twosentences are satisf ied with these constraints,  they arecalled "local cohesion" here.
As shown in F igure 2, thereare 18 types, determined by three constra ints  for verbsand six constra ints  for nouns.Type h the same verbs and the same nouns .For example,"Could you send me a paper?""
\[ sent  you the paper yesterday.
"Both of the verbs in the quest ion sentence and  theanswer  sentence are the same words, "send".
Also, itsobject is the same word, "paper" .
Th is  const ra in t  isdescribed as follows.send < Xl ,paper ,  Z1 >,  send < X2,paper,Z2 >.This  constra int  means  that  if two sentences include"send" and its object, "paper", the sentences are cohesive.Therefore the following sentences are cohesive becausethey satisfy the same constraint .For example,"May I send you a paper  to your office?
""P lease  send me the paper to my home address.
"send< Xl ,paper,  Z I>,  send< X2,paper,Z2 >.\[ In terpretat ion  \]This knowledge can be appl ied into in terpretat ion~ v e r b s  Inoklnsthe samethe synonymic nouns \[tile sanle nouus withmodifier.the same nouns withcompound noun.the thesame synonymicverbs verbsType 1 Type2Type 4 Type 5Type 7 Type 8Type 10 Type 11thedifferentverbsType 3Type 6Type 9Type 12synonymic nouns with Type 13 Type 14 Type 15modifier.synonymic nouns with Type 16 Type 17 Type 18coropound noun.Type 2: Synonymio verbs and the same nouns.

Aflow of the sys tem is shown in F igure  4.
Input tedsentences are analyzed with grammar  ules and lexicons,based on LexicaLfunct ional  Grammar  (LFG) (1), and thenintermediate  representat ions ( F-structures of LFG ) areobtained.
An in termediate  representat ion is convertedinto its skeleton, because it has too much informat ion toprocess for a context, in F igure 5.
It  is used to uni fy  with"local cohesive knowledge" in the context processing.The a lgor i thm of the context processing mechan ism isas follows.
(1) Make a pair  of skeletons: to check the local cohesion,br ing the skeletons of the previous utterance and make apair  of skeletons.
(2) Check the local cohesion: look up the table of "localcohesive knowledge" as a key of the pair  of skeletons.

The exper imentWhen we built the system, one of the most importantproblems was how to produce the knowledge.
We definedthe local cohesive knowledge and used its definition toextract knowledge from a l inguist ics database almostautomatically.We have a l inguist ic  database which inc ludes 60keyboard dialogues.
The dialogues include 70,000 wordsin total and the number of different words is more than3000.
These dialogues are analyzed and managed by al inguistic database (P-).We extracted local cohesive knowledge  from 60dialogues which include 350 verbs and 1000 nouns.
Firstwe made a table which includes each verb and its noun.Then we extracted constraints of local cohesive knowledgeto make the pair  from the table.
Constraint pattern (a),a:!~ shown in Figure 3, was obtained automatical ly fromthe data and patterns (b) and (e) were generated frompattern (a).
We obtained 24531 assert ions o f " loca lcohesive knowledge" for types 1, 2 and 3, and 651a.,.
;:sertions of"local cohesive knowledge" for t.ypes 7, 8 and9, We have learned that local cohesive knowledge is verysparse.

It has 200 grammar ules and more than 3000words.
It transfers Japanese sentences into English ones.It was implemented in Quintus Prolog on a SUN-4 systemand its program size was 3.4MB.An example is shown in Figure 5.
(1) kurejitto kaado (credit card) no (of) namae(name) o (OBJ) oshiete kudasai (Could you tell).\[ = Could you tell me the name of credit card.
9\](2) motte (have) inai (not) no desu ga (copula).\[ = 1 don't have a credit card.
\]in the sentence (2) there is an ellipsis.
It means"kurejitto kaado (credit card)".
It points to the modifier inthe previous entence, "kurejitto kaado no namae ( nameof credit card)".
In this approach, as a results of analysis,the skeletons of two sentences are obtained as shown inFigure 5.
The pair of skeletons are satisfied with the localcohesive knowledge (c) in Figure 5.
Then the ellipsis isobtained as a 'credit card'.6.
CONCI :US IONSTo bui ld a "contextua l  robustness"  system,  weproposed a context-processing mechanism which analyzedthe context with "local cohesive knowledge".
In order toapply the model into a machine-translat ion system, theknowledge needs to be produced effectively.
Therefore wedefined 18 types of" local cohesive knowledge" and usedthis definition to abstract knowledge from a linguisticsdatabase almost automatically.
Some of the 18 types wereimplemented on a machine translation system.
The othertypes were not  generated ,  because they inc ludessynonyms.
In l, he future, we will construet hem with athesaurus  and also extend the context  process ingalgorithm to process more complicated phenomena suchas parallel phrases.A(J I (NOWI~EI)GEMENTSThe a;~timr would liI~e to thank Akh'a }';.urematsu , president ofATR and Ii itoshi l ida \[,r their coustant encouragemenl,.
