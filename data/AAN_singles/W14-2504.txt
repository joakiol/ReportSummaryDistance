Proceedings of the ACL 2014 Workshop on Language Technologies and Computational Social Science, page 4,Baltimore, Maryland, USA, June 26, 2014.c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsLocation and Language Use in Social MediaEd ChiGoogleAbstractWe now know that social interactions are critical in many knowledge and information processes.In this talk, I plan to illustrate a model-driven approach to understanding social behavior arounduser location and different languages in social media.First, in 2010, we performed the first in-depth study of user location field in Twitter user profiles.We found that 34% of users did not provide real location information, frequently incorporatingfake locations or sarcastic comments that can fool traditional geographic information tools.
Wethen performed a simple machine learning experiment to determine whether we can identify ausers location by only looking at contents of a user?s tweets.
We found that a users country andstate can in fact be determined easily with decent accuracy, indicating that users implicitly reveallocation information, with or without realizing it.Second, despite the widespread adoption of Twitter in different locales, little research has inves-tigated the differences among users of different languages.
In prior research, the natural tendencyhas been to assume that the behaviors of English users generalize to other language users.
Westudied 62 million tweets collected over a four-week period.
We discovered cross-language dif-ferences in adoption of features such as URLs, hashtags, mentions, replies, and retweets.
We alsofound interesting patterns of how multi-lingual Twitter users broker information across these lan-guage boundaries.
We discuss our works implications for research on large-scale social systemsand design of cross-cultural communication tools.4
