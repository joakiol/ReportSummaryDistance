ukAbstractWe.
present a study of the mappingsfrom semantic content to syntactic ex-pression with the aim of isolating theprecise locus and role of pragmatic infor-mation in the generation process, l~oma corpus of English, French, and Por-tuguese instructions for consumer prod-ucts, we demonstrate the range of ex-pressions of two semantic relations, GEN-EI~ATION and ENABLEMENT (Goldman,1970) in each language, and show howthe available choices are constrained syn-tactically, semantically, and pragmati-cally.
The study reveals how multilin-gum NLG can be informed by language-specific principles for syntactic hoice.1 Int roduct ionWe report here on work which addresses themessage-to-syntax mapping in the context of au-tomatic generation of instructional texts thekinds of texts found in the procedural parts ofmanuMs or information leaflets, pharmaceuticMproducts.
Instructional texts do not simply con-sist of lists of imperatives: instructions may alsodescribe, eulogise, inform and explain.
Generatinggood-quality draft instructions requires a detailedspecification of how to map from semantic repre-sentations of the task actions onto a wide range oflinguistic expressions.Our corpus is composed of naturally-occurringinstructions in the three languages of study.
Ouroverall approach is to obtain different-languagedrafts that are congruenl with the technical con-tent embodied in the task to be performed (andwith other relevant information about the task).A satisfactory level of congruence requires the useof syntactic and pragmatic rules appropriate toeach target language, mat)ping fi'om the seman-tics to appropriate xpression in a way that is frecfrom influence from any source language 1.
We1See (Hartley and Paris, 1995) for discussion of thebegin the generation process with a plan-basedmodel of the underlying task}In our study, we have looked at two specificprocedurM relations that can hold between pairsof actions in a task, identified by the philoso-pher Alvin Goldman as the relations of GENEP~-ATION and ENABLEMENT (Goldman, 1970) re-lations which have the advantage of being tbr-mally specified (see e.g.
(Pollack, 1986; Balkanski,1993)), and need to be expressed regularly withininstructional texts.
In section 2, we give a briefdefinition of generation and enablement, beforegoing on in section 3 to describe how the two re-lations are realised in the corpus of Portuguese,English, and French instructions.2 The Semant ic  Relat ionsGeneration and enablement are relations that canhold between pairs of states, events, processes, oractions.
A simple test of generation holding be-tween action pairs is whether it can be said thatby performing one of the actions (a) under appro-priate conditions, the other (/9) will automaticMlyoccur (Pollack, 1986).
If so, it can be said that c,generates/).
The two actions must be performed,or perceived to be performed, by the same humanagent, and the two actions must be asymmetric(i.e.
if a generates fl, then fl cannot generate a).Simple examples of generation are ~ follows: 3(1) Heat gently to soften the coating.
(2) Dial the numbers of the Mercury authorisa-tion code by pressing the appropriate num-bers on the keypad.In example 1, the action of heating gently ha~sthe effect of softening the coating.
In example 2,advantages of this approach over the inherent limi-tations of a translation-based approach to producingmultilinguM instructions.2See (Paris et al, 1995) for a discussion of the mod-elling of domain knowledge for instructions in the coil-text of a support ool for drafting instructional texts.3So far, we have concentrated onexamples of thesesemantic relations that do not cross sentence bound-aries.292pressing the correct keypad numbers has the auto-marie effect of dialing the numbers of the Mercuryauthorisation code.
In each case, by performingthe ?t action (or set of actions), the user has au-tomatically performed the fl action.
Note thatthe two actions can bc presented in either order:generatiNG first, or generatED first.q'he term cnablemeut is commonly used to re-fer to the procedural relation between precondi-tions and actions.
It obtains between two actionswhere the execution of the first brings about a setof conditions that are necessary, but not necessar-ily suJJicienl for the subsequent performance ofthe second (Pollack, 1986).
This is different fromthe generation ('rose, since enablement requires thefurther intervention of an agent - and it need notbe the same agent - to bring about the fl even-tuality.

Example 4, front the instructionsfor a home photographic slide viewer, presents theenablED action ~ prolonged viewing - first, anddescribes to tile user what must be done to facili-tate it.These two relations have been formalised byPollack (1986) and Balkanski (1993) for the pur-poses of plan recognition, and can be representedin a plan formalism that is a simple extensionof STRll)S-styled operators developed by Fikes(1971) and expanded in the NOAII system (Sacer-doti, 1977).
\[Iere, we summarise the two relationsin the form of the following planning statements:,, (~ generates fl iff c~ is the body of a plan ewhose goal is ft.,, oe enables fl if ce is a precondition of a plan eand/3 is the goal of plan e, or iffl is the bodyof e and t~ is a preconditkm of/3.In order to generate instructions clearly, it mustbe obvious which, if either of the two relations isintended at any given point: eonflmion of one withthe other will lead to inadequte, incomplete, oreven dangerous execution of the t~k  described.3 From Semant ics  to SyntaxIlow, then, are generation and enablement re-alised in the three languages of study?
In whatfollows, we look at the syntactic resources thatare used in each language to convey the two partsof the two relations, and look at tile constraintson tile ordering of tile two parts; then, at whatdiscourse markers play a role in further ensuringthe clarity of the relation intended, and finallyshow how different rhetorical interpretations re-sult from these choices.
Together, these factorsexplain a significant amount of the cross-linguisticwtriation that occurs within the instructions ub-language, in what follows, however, it is not ourintention to suggest an ordering tbr the set of de~cisions that need to be made for generation: sofar, our research suggests a complex interaction offactors is involved in choice of expression, and timther research is required to establish their relativepriorities in the decision-making process.Our corpora for the study consisted of 65 exam-pies of generation, and 65 examples of enablementfor each of the three languages of study.

First,two syntactic forms, infinitives and imperatives,dominate; together they account for over 80% ofthe action expressions in tile data set.
Second, tileoverlap in expressions between ED and ING ele-ments is relatively small; it is confined to only twoof the five types of expressions: infinitives and pas-sives.
Finally, these data suggest hat the orderof occurrence of the ED and ING components in asentence does not interact with decisions of choiceof expression: in general, once a syntactic form ismade available lbr expressing El) or ING compo-nents, it can be used irrespective of the order ofoccurrence of that component in the sentence.French (see figure 2) shows a strong prefer-ence for the use of the two forms of imperative(imperative- simple and imperative-infinitive), theinfinitive anti tile gerundive.
Overall, however,there is a more even spread between choices than4 In order to satisfy ourselves that the linguistic ex--amples in the corpus were indeed representative r ali-sations of the two semantic relations described, we alsoperfornmd an experiment requiring naive informa.tsto identify linguistic cxamples as cases of one or otherrelation.

2 3 3 6 6.2Figure 2: Expressions of Generation: FrenchFrench, unlike Portuguese and English, has twoforms of imperative.
One is identical in form tothe infinitive of the verb and is usually associatedwith a generic addressee: a 'public' form of ad-dress.
The imperative-simple, on the other hand,is identical in form to the second-person plural 6indicative of the verb and its use is associatedwith identifiable addressees.
The fact that thisform accounts for 40% of imperatives in the cor-pus may be seen as evidence for the increasinglyuser-oriented style of instructions for householdappliances.Unlike in Portuguese, ordering does play a rolein French.
Both imperative-infinitive and impera-tive simple expressing eneratED occur first, whilea gerundive xpressing eneratiNG occurs second.In addition, Portuguese showed a strong differenti-ation between ED-specific and ING-specific forms,and therefore little overlap, but in French, overlapis much greater: only one form, the gerundive, isconstrained to one part of the semantic relation(generatiNG).English appears the most permissive in termsof both overlap between ED and ING-bearing ex-pressions, and lack of influence of ordering - acombination of the characteristics of the other twolanguages.
While there is a strong preference forinfinitive and imperative forms, the influence ofthe part of the semantic relation only extends,as in French, to a single form: the appearanceof the infinitive as an expression of generatEDrather than generatiNG.
The influence of order-ing appears to be at the level of weak preferences,in line with Portuguese, rather than the strongerrole seen in French generation.

While there was no orderingpreference in Portuguese generation, there is anordering constraint on enablement: imperativesexpressing ED do not appear first.
The distribu-tion of syntactic forms (figure 4) shows that, whilethere is a high degree of overlap in terms of ex-pression of 1NG or ED, a system of preferencesoperates: the infinitive is three times as likely tobe used for the ED than ING component, whilethe imperative is twice as likely to be used for INGthan for ED.SyntaxInfinitivehnperativeNomina!EnablED ~ EnabliNG- 1st 2n~ Tot-al 1st 2nd Total I \]17 ~5 3 80 29 29 3 19 493 2 5 3 2Figure 4: Expressions of Enablement: PortugueseFrench has a relatively broad range of expres-sions available for enablement (see figure 5)-muchwider than Portuguese.
As was the case for gen-eration, French enablement shows a strong order-ing preference: when an imperative is used as en-ablED, it must be placed second (if expressinggeneratED, it must be placed first).
The gerun-dive is strongly marked for generation, and in therare cases it is used in enablement is restricted to asingle semantic role: expressing enabliNG, ratherthan enablED-the only French expression so re-stricted.

'l'hese alternations in ordering are discussed in(Vander l,inden, 1.993) in terms of the intention t.oconvey optionality or oblig~ttoriness of tile action int|te matrix clause.295As was the case with generation in English,there is a high degree of overlap between all otherexpressions of the two parts of the relation.3.2 D iscourse  Markers  and  Rhetor i ca lRe la t ionsVery strong correlations appear between particu-lar choices of semantic relation and syntactic formon the one hand, and the appearance of discoursemarkers and/or a strong bias towards a particularrhetorical interpretation on the other.
Our anal-ysis shows that selection of syntactic expressionand local discourse relation strongly interact, andprovides a rather clearer picture of the influencesthat bear on the mapping front semantics to syn-tax.A particularly important element to emergeis the language-specific nature of the choice ofrhetorical relation, a notion which we express forthe moment in terms of l~ST-style rhetorical rela-tions, of.
(Mann and Thompson, 1988).
The anal-ysis represents a careful but intuitive interpreta-tion of what rhetorical relation would be retrieved,by a native speaker of the language, front the par-ticular combination of syntax, discourse marker,and content.
What triggers these interpretationsis constrained both by semantic content and bythe conventions and syntactic resources availablewithin the languages of study.3.2.1 Por tuguesePortuguese appears to have obligatory signallingof discourse relation by a discourse marker, orat the very least by punctuation s .
Three dis-course relations are available for generation (PUR-POSE, CONDITION, RESULT) and two for enable-ment (PURPOSE, SEQUENCE).
For generation, thedominant relation is PURPOSE (80%); for enable-ment it is SEQUENCE (72%).
The overlap in thesyntax of generation vs enablement sentences isconfined to expressions of PURPOSE.
Figures 7 and8 show the relationships between semantic relationand syntax with an overlay of discourse: rhetoricalrelations and discourse markers.\[ Discourse SyntaxgeneratED generatl NG(80.1%)Condition(9.3%)Result(1..5%)cnecaso EDse El)e + aulomat-icamente ED~-nfinitiveinfinitivenominalinfinitivep;msivef'u\[ure(agent = artifact)~imperative,passive,infinitive}basta + infinitive{imperative, infinitive}imperative}infinitive/imperative~npera6C, ZFigure 7: Portuguese: GenerationThe figures show a strong and unambiguous re-SThis can be compared with the finding presentedby (Moser and Moore, 1995) in their ACL-95 presen-.tation, that discourse cues are significantly more likelyto occur when the 'contributor' component of the re-lation PRECEDES the 'core' in English dialogues.lationship between rhetorical relation, discoursemarker, and syntax.
There is a strong tendencyto present generation in terms of the rhetoricalrelation of I'URPOSE, which is marked almost in-variably by para or para que (so that), both ofwhich can only take a nominal or infinitival ex-pression.
SEQUENCE, on the other hand, is sig-nalled by temporal connectives uch as antes de(before), depois de (after) or apes (afte,9, by theconnective e (and) or implicitly by the use of acomma between the elements of a string of imper-atives.
For Portuguese nablement, wo relationsare preferred: PURPOSE and SEQUENCE, with astrong preference for the latter.
Again, the mark-ers of each rhetorical relation are distinct.Discourse Syntaxrelation cue\['urpose para (ED) - -(18.5%)Sequence antes de tED)(72.3%) depois de (ING)ap6s (ING)o tED)-~\]mblED enabliNG(n~i ,  infinitive} \]imperativeinfinitive I ba.sta + infinitiveL _imperative I infinitiveimperative I !

However, where theydo occur, the markers unambiguously assign theexpressions to one or other of the plan elements:body (si, en and par) or goal (pour, afin de, andde fafon it).
While Portuguese generation is over-whelmingly expressed through the rhetorical re-lation of PURPOSE, in French it is more evenlydistributed between PURPOSE and MEANS, witha small showing for CONDITmN.
Although notshown in the figure, there is only one case inFrench generation where the choice of orderingof the elements and the choice of marker-plus-expression are not mutually constraining: this iswhen the preposition pour is followed by an infini-tive.

In particular, for rhetorical planning ofthe communication f particular content, we canuse the preferences observed for selection of thepreferred rhetorical relation in the language inquestion.
Second, we can use our knowledge ofhow that relation is constituted and expressed interms of syntax for marking the relation appropri-ately.The approach also reveals ome interesting factsabout the individual languages.
In particular, wefound different levels of tolerance of resid-ual ambiguity:  Portuguese has little ambigu-ity in the mapping from semantic ontent o syn-tactic realisation (the least ambiguous markers ofrhetorical relation, fewest available syntactic re-alisations, least overlap in the roles of these real-isations for conveying one or the other semanticrelation, most restricted set of favoured rhetori-cal relations).
English, on the other hand, hadthe opposite characteristics.
We also found dif-fering preferences for rhetor ical  relations inexpressing semantic ontent: for example, whilePortuguese xpresses generation in over 80% ofcases with the relation of PURPOSE, French gener-ation divides this relation almost equally betweenPURPOSE and MEANS.
The English corpus, onthe other hand, while it has a strong showing forPURPOSE (around 50%), reveals arelatively strongshowing (around 14%) for the relation of RESULT,a relation found in only 1.5% of the Portugueserelations and not at all in French.No natural anguage has an unambiguous map-ping from semantics to surface syntax, whichmakes the information encoded by syntax, bothsemantic and pragmatic, very difficult to con-sciously 'unpack' from surface form in the per-formance of the translation task.
We suggest thatuncovering the decisions necessary for producingpragmatically-appropriate sets of parallel instruc-tions is a task best performed as an empiricalstudy along the lines suggested here.
In this way,we can encode language-specific pragmatic princi-ples into tools that support he process of multi-lingual document production.ReferencesCecile T. Balkanski.
