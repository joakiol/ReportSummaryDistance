"A" / Montreal, QC / H3C 3P8e-mail: sr@info.uqam.caThe notion of semantic roles is usually at-tributed to Fillmore \[8\], however its history canbe traced back through TesniSre \[16\] to Panini.Following this tradition, many researchers ec-ognize their usefulness in the description oflanguage - -  even if they do not agree on theirsignificance \[7\].
However, a weak or strongcommitment to this notion does not elude thefact that it proves to be very difficult to settle ona finite set of labels along with their formal def-initions.
The di lemma resulting from thischallenge is well known: to require a univocalidentification by each role results in an increasein their number while to abstract their semanticcontent gives rise to an inconsistent set.
If a fi-nite set is possible, one has to find a properbalance between these two extremes.
As a result,every flavor of roles have been used from time totime in linguistics (e.g., GB, in the spirit ofFillmore, HPSG, in the line of situation seman-tics), and also in AI \[10, see also 4\].Between the total refusal to use those labels(as in GPSG) and the acceptance of individualroles (as in HPSG) there is a wide range of pro-posals on what constitute a good set ofL(inguistic)-Roles \[7\] and, as a consequence, onthe way to differentiate between them and definethem.
Most of the definitions have been based onthe referential properties that can be associatedwith each role bearer (e.g.
an AGENT is avolitional animate ntity).
Even if this approachis necessary at one time or another, this kind ofdefinition inevitably leads to either the "let'screate another ole" or the "let's abstract itsdefinition" syndromes.
Properties are not alwaysof the static kind though.
Sometimes, dynamicproperties are also used (e.g.
an AGENT is theperceived instigator of the action).Since one of the desired characteristic of aroles system is the power to discriminate vents\[5\] (another "desired" property being to offer aneasier selection of grammatical functions), therecognition of semantic roles should be linked tothe interpretation f the event, that is to their dy-namic properties.
In a study on locative verbs inFrench, Boons \[3\] has convincingly shown theimportance of taking into account aspectual cri-teria in the description of a process, suggestingthat GOAL and SOURCE roles should be reinvesti-gated in the light of those criteria.
It is ourhypothesis that proliferation of roles is a naturalphenomenon caused by the specialized proper-ties required by the interpretation of a predicatewithin a specific semantic field: to overlookthese properties yields the over-generalizationalready mentionned.
The best way to approachthe expansion/contraction dilemma is to searchfor the minimal relations required for a dynamicinterpretation f events (in terms of their aspec-tual criteria and through an identification of allthe participants in i0.Our first step toward this abstraction was toconsider each participant (individuals orproperties) either as a localized entity (a token)or a location (a place), and to determine its rolein the realization of the process expressed by thepredicate.
The model exhibits some commonpoints with a localist approach \[1,11\] since itrecognizes (in an abstract sense) the importanceof spatio-temporal "regions" in the process ofindividuation of events \[14\].
To express thechange of localization (again in an abstractsense), the notion of transitions is used.
Theentire construction is inspired by Petri net theory\[15\]: a set S of places, a set T of transitions, aflow relation F: (S x T) ~ (T x S) and markersare the categories used to define the structure ofa process (and as a consequence of the eventscomposing it).For example, the dynamic representation fMax embarque lacaisse sur le cargo \[3J/Max em-barks the crate on the cargo boat can be analyzedin two steps.
First there is a transition from aninitial state IS where the crate is not on the cargoboat to a final state FS where the crate is on thecargo boat.
The final state can be expressed bythe static passive, la caisse est embarqude sur lecargo~the crate was embarked on the cargo boat,and is schematized in (2).
One of the argument(cargo boat) is used as a localization while theother argument is used as a localized entity(crate), the THEME according to Gruber \[9\].
Theinitial state can be expressed (in this case) by thenegation of the final state and is schematized in(1).
The realization of the entire process is thenrepresented by the firing of the net which can beillustrated by the snapshots (1) and (2).1.

IS:O---\[---(~):FsTo integrate the participation of "Max" inthe model, we recognize the importance of335causality in the discrimination of events \[13,14\].Since the cause is understood to be the firstentity responsible for the realization of events\[6\], the obvious chematization is (3).3.
4.It is possible that a recursive definition(places and transitions) will be necessary to ex-press "properly" the causation, the localizationof events and processes or the concept of dy-namic states \[2,14\].
In that case, the schematiza-tion could then be (4).
But we can achieve thesame result through a proper type definition ofthe transition expressing the cause: (s x 0 -~ (t x((s x t) -, (t x s))), where "s" is a place and "t", atransition.This approach to semantic roles determina-tion is close to the one undertook by Jackendoff\[12\].
His identification of each role to a particu-lar argument position in a conceptual relation isgiven here by the way it participate to the firingof the net.
(It is our guess that most of the con-ceptual relations used by Jackendoff can beexpressed within this model, giving to them anoperational interpretation.)
The model has theadvantage to give an explicit and simple defini-tion of relations that do not have the samesemantic range (e.g.
CAUSE vs FROM vs AT).The analysis of locative processes usingabstract regions instead of the traditional roles isbetter because it is, we think, the real basis ofthose interpretations.
Abstracting away referen-tial properties gives the basic interactions ex-pressed by the predicate.
Specifying thoseproperties within a specific semantic field givesrise to the set of roles we are used to (e.g.
withinthe spatial field, schematizations (1) and (2)express SOURCE and GOAL roles).With this model we were able to give anoperational description of the difference betweenMax charge des briques dans le camion/Maxloads bricks in the truck and Max charge lecamion de briques/Max loads the truck withbricks.
The schematization take into accountwhich participant is responsible for each transi-tion firing and thus can lead us to the "final"place.
As a first approximation of these continu-ous processes, (5) and (6) are proposed (thedirect contribution of the instrument is alsointroduced).
But recognition, as a participant ofthe quantity of bricks in (5) and the capacity ofthe truck in (6), results in the schematizations (7)et (8) (both display a specialization of theirdirect object in order to complete the semanticinterpretation).. :b 'uckl5.

The resulting notation seemsalso an interesting way to explore the differencesbetween static and dynamic processes, differ-ences that are not very '~,isual" if one is using astatic notation.Our research is now directed toward theanalysis of the system when more semanticcontent is used.
We are testing if these adds-onhave impacts on its behaviour, while analyzing ifthe partial semantic interpretation gives rise tothe predicted syntactic forms (that is how doeseach potential participant is grammaticalized).References\[1\] Anderson, J.M., 1971.
