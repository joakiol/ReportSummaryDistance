Identification of verbparts in a sentence is essential for itsunderstanding and they constitute as if theyare a single entity.
Considering them as asingle entity improves the translation of theverbal construct and thus the overallquality of the translation.
The paperdescribes a strategy for pre-processing andfor identification of verb parts in sourceand target language corpora.
The stepstaken towards reducing sparsity furtherhelped in improving the translation results.1 IntroductionWith the availability of parallel content, increasedmemory and processing speed, there has beengrowing trend moving towards Statistical MachineTranslation.
Most of the phrase based machinetranslation systems are based on the noisy-channelbased IBM models (Koehn, Och & Marcu, 2003,Zens et al, 2004).
Phrases refer to a number ofconsecutive words that may not be a valid syntacticphrase but are learnt through the statisticalalignment between two languages.
English andHindi have differing syntactical structure and posegreat challenge in aligning phrases of the twolanguages.
The former follows SVO pattern whilethe later adheres to the SOV pattern.
Hindi beingmorphologically richer offers several verbalconstructs governed through Tense, Aspect andModality (TAM).
The non-monotonocity betweenthe two languages causes inferior alignment ofphrases especially verbal constructs.There have been efforts towards singletokenization of MWE parts.
Ueffing and Ney,2003 reported use of POS information for SMT tomorphologically richer language.
They tried totransform the source language while the approachproposed here attempts transformations on bothsource and target laguage sides.
Recent relatedworks use statistical measures like MutualInformation and Log Likelihood Ratio (Seretanand Wehrli, 2007) to know the degree of cohesionbetween constituents of a MWE.
These requiredefining threshold value above which the extractedphrase is qualified as a MWE.Minkov et al (2007) utilized the rich syntacticand morphological analyzers to generate theinflections.
Hindi lacks availability of robustparsers and complex morphological analyzers.The paper describes the process of identifyingverbal constructs of both languages and groupingthem in single units to reduce the search space.
Foridentification of the verbal constructs, the POSinformation is utilized with simple combining rulesto make verb phrases.
This yields better alignmentof verbal phrases and results in more grammatical,fluent and acceptable translations.
Besides that, thedata sparseness generated from chunking is95handled through extending the phrase table withverbal parts entries.The paper is organized in sections, describingthe phrase based SMT in brief, Hindi language andits verbal properties followed by sectionsdescribing identification of verbal constructs inEnglish and Hindi.
Further to it, corpus and pre-processing activities are detailed alongwith theexperimental setup, process adopted to reducesparcity, the translation process, observations andconclusion.2 Overview of SMTCandide SMT system [Brown et al, 1990],presented by the IBM researchers paved the pathfor statistical approach to machine translation.In statistical machine translation, we are given asource language sentence S = sI1 = s1 .
.
.
si .
.
.
sI ,which is to be translated into a target language(?English?)
sentence T = tJ1 = t1 .
.
.
tj .
.
.
tJ.Statistical machine translation is based on a noisychannel model.
It considers T to be the target of acommunication channel, and its translation S to bethe source of the channel.
System may generatemultiple translation sentences options and theproblem of translation becomes identifyingsentence T which fits as the best translation of thesource sentence S. Hence the machine translationtask becomes to recover the source from the target.So, we need to maximize P(T|S).
According to theBayes rule,As, P(S) is constant,Here,  P(s|t) represents Translation model andP(t) represents language model.
Translation modelplays the role of ensuring translation faithfulnessand Language model to ensure the fluency oftranslated output.3 Hindi language and its verbalpropertiesIndian languages are classified in four majorfamilies: Indo-Aryan (a branch of the Indo-European family), Dravidian, Austro-Asiatic(Austric), and Sino-Tibetan, with theoverwhelming majority of the population speakinglanguages belonging to the first two families.There are 22 languages listed in eighth schedule ofconstitution of India.
The four major families aredifferent in their form and construction, but theyshare many orthographic similarities, because theirscripts originate from Brahmi (Ishida, 2002).Hindi language belongs to the Indo-Aryanlanguage family.
It is spoken in vast areas ofnorthern India and is written in Devanagari script.In Hindi, words belonging to various grammaticalcategories appear in lemma and inflectional forms.Hindi Verbal constructs system is based on theTAM of the action.
The Verbal costructs areformed by placement of auxiliary verbs after themain verb.
The main verb that carries the lexicalmeaning may appear in the root or inflected form.Auxiliary verbs of the main verb denote the TAMproperty of the verbal construct.Tense is a grammatization of the relationsbetween time of some event and the refrence time.Aspect markers are semantically very sensitive andoften convey subtle meanings and nuances that arenot generally expressed through simple lexicalwords.
Here we look at the two example sentences,1.
??
???
??
????
????
?
?vaha din bhar baithaa rahataa hai(?He remains seated whole day?).2.
??
???-???
?????
????
?
?vaha baar-baar baithtaa rahataa hai(?He sits frequetly?
)Here, aspect marker ??
??
?yaa raha?
in firstsentence, denotes the resultant state of the actionand ??
?raha?
gives perception of a longer period oftime.
While in a slightly modified second sentence,the aspect marker ??
??
?taa raha?
gives the senseof repetition or infinity of the action and ??
?raha?gives the perception of a time spread.The mood reflects speaker?s attitude towards theaction and is manifested in many ways in alanguage.
In Hindi the moods can be of Imperative,?
?
?
?
?
??
?sPtPtsPstPttt*|maxarg|maxarg* ???
?
?
?tPtsPtt*|maxarg* ?96Subjunctive, Indefinite and definite potential,conditional and future etc.
Here we look at thefollowing three sentences.1.
?
???
tu padh  (?You read?)2.
??
????
tu padh (?You read?)3.
??
????
tu padh (?You read?
)All the above three sentences are imperative innature but there is subtle difference in speaker?sattitude.
The first sentence is the impolite form ofexpression, the second one is common form andthe third sentence is the polite form of expressingthe same thing.All constituents of the verbal constructs areobligatory.
Semantically TAM markers are soclosely interlinked that it would be appropriate totreat them as a single entity rather than treatingthem sperately.
Besides that, the main verb appearsfrequently in compound and conjunct forms in theverbal constrcuts (Singh, 2010).
Compound verbsfollow the pattern of verb-verb (V-V) combinationwhile conjunct verbs are formed with either noun-verb (N-V) or adjective-verb (A-V) combinations.In V-V expressions the first verb word carriesverbal stem while successive verb words play therole of auxiliary or light verbs (LV).
The LVsloose their independent meaning and are used toreflect the shade of main verb.
The compound andconjunct verb expressions are also referred ascomplex predicates (CP).
The CPs are multi-wordexpressions (MWEs) which may be compositionalor non-compositional in nature (Sinha, 2011).These should be treated as a single verbal unit toinfer the intended meaning or semantics.
The CPadds to the expressiveness of the expression butpose difficulty for automatic identification.4 Identification and treatment verbalconstructsThe elements of verbal constructs, if treated asindividual words leave too many entries in thesentences to get algned through statisticalalignment.
This makes the probability distributionunfocussed.
Co-joining parts of verbal constructsreduces the sentence length and thus helps in betteralignment.4.1 English verbal constructsThe Stanford POS tagger (Kristina Toutanova etal., 2003) is used for tagging words in a sentencewith their POS categories.
The POS tags are basedon Penn Treebank POS tagset (Mitchell et al,1993).
The verbal parts to be chunked together areidentified with the help of a set of rules.
Some ofthese rules are listed in the Table 1.
As an example,the rule ?get NP VBN?
specifies, that if NounPhrase appears in between the word ?get?
andVBN, this is considered as a verbal construct.POS based Verb Chunking RulesVBP/VBD/VBZ  VBGMD not VBget  NP VBNTable 1: Sample rules for identiying EnglishVerbal constructsThese rules are impletemented in the form of aFinite State Machine (FSM).
The NP-phraseappearing in between the verb construct parts isidentified and FSM implementation helps inachieving this.
Similarly, the model auxiliaries like?can be?
are also co-joined with successive verbs.These simple rules help in identifying theconstituents of verbal constructs.
The negationmarkers or noun phrases that appear in betweenverbal constructs are moved out to reduce sparsity.Table 2 shows some English verbal constructs andhow these are co-joined.Verbal Constructs Co-joined Verbal Constructsis going is_goingcan not be done not can_be_doneget the work done get_done the workTable 2: Sample English Verbal constructs4.2 Identification of Hindi verbal constructsFor identifying the Hindi verbal constructs, acombination of POS tagging and presence of theTAM markers appearing as verb ending sequencesare used.
The POS tags are based on modifiedPenn Treebank POS tagset.
The POS taggingidentifies possible verbal parts to be chunked,while the TAM rules help in confirmation of them.Table 3 lists some of the TAM rules.

Thiscontains travel expressions which are generallyused when a person travels to another country andcovers the utterances of potential subjects in travelsituations.
The expressions contained more thanone sentence in single expression.
These have beenseparated by sentence end markers (dot).
Suchsentences have been treated as separate sentenceentities.
This increased the number of independentsentences in parallel corpus.
The Tables 6 and 7list corpus statistics.Corpus  Training Development TestEnglish:# sentences 19972 2343 2371# words 153066 17806 18257# avg words/ sentence7.7 7.6 7.7Hindi:# sentences 19972 2043 2071# words 171347 17774 17811# avg words/ sentence8.6 8.7 8.6Table 6: Corpus Statistics before pre-processing98Corpus  Training Development TestEnglish:# sentences 24056 2581 2575# avg words/ sentence6.3 6.4 6.3Hindi:# sentences 24056 2581 2575# avg words/ sentence7.2 7.1 7.2Table 7: Corpus Statistics after pre-processingThe average sentence length in the Englishcorpus before pre-processing was 7.7 words persentence and after pre-processing it came down to6.3 words per sentence.
Hindi corpus had 8.7words per sentence and it became 7.2 words persentence after pre-processing.The pre-processing activity also includedexpanding of common abbreviated expressions e.g.I?ll to ?I will?
etc.
This has been performed with aset of simple expansion rules.
Besides that, dotsappearing after titles are also replaced with hash(#), to avoid being treated them as sentence end-markers.6 Experimental setupFor the training of the statistical models, standardword alignment GIZA++ (Och & Ney, 2003) andlanguage modelling toolkit SRILM (Stolcke, 2002)tools were used.
For translation, MOSES phrase-based SMT decoder (Koehn, 2007) has been used.For evaluation, the automatic evaluation metrics,BLEU (Papineni, 2002) was applied to thetranslation output.7 Translation processThe overall process can be classified as Trainingand Testing processes.
The training processdescribes the steps involved in building models.These steps include ?
pre-processing of trainingcorpus, POS tagging source and target languagetraining corpus, chunking words forming theverbal constructs, building translation andlanguage models.Figure 1: Training processTesting process describes steps whiletranslating.
It involves - pre-processing of testcorpus, POS tagging of test corpus, chunking thewords forming the verbal constructs and searchingwords in the vocabulary of training models.
Ifsome words are unseen but are lexical words ofverbal constructs, they are handled as described insection 8 below.Figure 2: Testing process998 Handling sparsityDue to limited size of parallel corpus used fortraining the models, it is quite probable that someverbal constructs may appear which is unseen bythe training model and is out of vocabulary (OOV).The probability of such occurrence increases dueto the co-joining of words forming verbalconstructs.
To meet this situation, templates ofdifferent verbal constructs with their translationsare used.
The Table 8 shows some sampletemplates with their translations.If verbal construct is OOV, it is changed to itstranslation template form.
After that, its equivalenttranslation is picked up and is replaced in thesentence to be translated.
As an example, if theverbal construct ?would_have_been_cleaning?
isOOV.
It is changed to its template formwould_have_been_VBG and its respectivetranslation VB_???_????
is picked up from thetranslation template table.
Now, with the help ofEnglish-Hindi dictionary, translation of verbalconstruct ?would_have_been_cleaning?
in thesentence is replaced with the translated as????_??_???_????
and is sent for final translation.Verbal construct template Translation templatecan_VB VB_????_?
?VB_saktaa_haiwould_have_been_VBG VB_???_???
?VB_rahaa_hogaahas_not_VBN ???_?VB??_?
?nahi_VByaa_haiTable 8: Verbal Construct template translationIf the verb is not present in the English-Hindidictionary too, it is translierated and ????
is addedto it.
Now, the verbal construct in the sourcesentence is replaced with its transliterated formbefore sending for translation.
As an example, ifword ?clean?
is not found in English-Hindidictionary, its translterated form ??????
isgenerated and ????
is added to it.
The verbalconstruct ?would_have_been_cleaning?
in thesource sentence is replaced with transliteratedverbal construct ?????_??_???_?????
beforesending for SMT.
For trnasliteration in-housestatistical transliteration system is used.9 ExperimentsThe experiments were carried on original, pre-processed and chunked verbal constructs basedmodels.
Table 9 below show that there isimprovement in BLUE score when we pre-processthe raw corpus.
Better alignment is achieved due toreduced sentence length and data being innormalized form.
The chunked verbal constructscorpus further improves the BLUE score.
Thoughthe BLUE score gain is marginal but on humaninspection, better order and organization of Verbalconstructs is observed.
The table below shows theBLEU score for experiments.Corpus BLEUScoreGain inBLEU scoreBPP * 0.1596APP * 0.1672 0.0076APP + VCC * 0.1694 0.0022Table 9: BLEU scores for different experiments* BPP   -  Before Pre-processing the corpus* APP   -  After Pre-processing the corpus* APP + VCC  -  After Pre-Processing corpus +Verbal Constructs Chunking10 Conclusion and Future WorkResults show, moderate gain in BLUE score isobtained with pre-processing of the corpus.
Thiscan be attributed to better alignment due toreduced length of sentences.
Marginal gain isobserved with chunking of Verbal constructs, yetmanual inspection show fluent translation of verbalparts.Hindi verb forms are sensitive to gender,number and person information, which is notconsidered in current implementation.
Work oninterrogatives, prepositional phrases and othermulti-word expressions, is in progress.
There isscope to improve the statistical alignment usinglinguitic knowledge.
The investigations on theseare currently in progress.100AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Centre for Development ofAdvanced Computing (CDAC) for providingconducive environment for this work.
