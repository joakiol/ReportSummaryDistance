1.1 TheSystem iln glen eralSince The MT-System of IBM Germany has already been describedelsewhere \[5\] \[63, we shall confine us to the aspects of thesystem which are substantial  to our problem.The system consists of two l inguist ical ly signif icant parts:a machine lexicon residing on a direct access device and aprogram package.
The machine lexicon contains:I. Engl ish words,2.
a code providing grammaticalinformation about each word,3.
German equivalents.In case of more Than one possible German equivalent of anEngl ish word, there are - roughly spoken - as many separatelexicon entries in the machine lexicon as German Translations.To put it in a more precise way: for an Engl ish homograph,redundant as it may be, there is a separate lexicon entryfor each v of its syntactic funtions, i.e.
an English wordlike CHANGE has been entered in the lexicon as a noun CHANGE,with the German translation: KNDERUNG and also as a verb -CHANGE, with the Translat ion VERXNDERN.
The order of entriesis fixed.While The machine lexicon provides each Engl ish word withone or more German equivalents, the program package operatingon the lexicon develops the proper Translat ion for the Englishinput text.The f i rst  step of processing is the lexical assignment, i.e.each Engl ish word is looked up in The machine lexicon andits f irst occurence in The lexicon is Taken as the provis ionalt ranslat ion ~The fol lowing steps care for the proper choice of the Germanequivalents from Those other alternat ives provided by thelexicon, which remain accessible throughout the entire sub-sequent processing.
In order to choose the correct equivalent,The programs rely on the original  word order of the Englishinput text and the codes which are primari ly drawn from thelexicon.General ly it can be said, that as the processing progresses,we have more and more information about The l inguisticstructures at our disposal, and we can make increasinglysubtle decisions.
It is obvious that  to dist inguish betweenverbs and nouns is logically prior to the dist inct ion bet-ween, say, abstract nouns and concrete nouns.
(In praxi,however, the sequence of subroutines may not always be assimple as that.)
Similarly, we can dist inguish betweentransitive, reflexive and intransit ive verbs, only afterhaving establ ished the category of verbs in general, i.e.after the solution of homographs like:PLACE noun PLACE verbCHANGE noun CHANGE verbAlthough the disambiguation of syntactic homographs is byno means a tr ivial  task, we shall not go into furtherdetails about its actual realisation.For the fol lowing discussion we shall therefore presume,that occurring syntactic homographs have been solved.2.0 The ProblemConsider the fol lowing sentence pairs:l ie )  The company has increased  the  product ion .
(Ib) The product ion has increased  rap id ly .
(2a) Reg is ter  3 re turned  the  va lue unchanged.
(2b) The access arm re turned  to i t s  o r ig ina l  pos i t ion .I t  i s  c lear  that  the  (a )  and (b )  sentences  have  to  betranslated in a different way:( la")  Dig Gesg l l schaf t  hat  dig Prod~kt ion grhoeht Q( Ib") Dig Produkt ion hat s i ch  schne l l  erhoe-~t-.
(2a") Reg is ter  3 brachte den Weft  unveraendgrt  zurueck.
(2b") Der Zugr i f fa rm- -~r te  zu sg iner  u rsprueng l i chenPos i t ion  zuruec~-.It is not diff icult to see that the l inguist ical ly relevantcriterion for the proper German translat ion is the presenceor absence of a direct object-NP.
For the German translat ionof ( Ib ) the  implicit object must be made explicit by theinsertion of the German reflexive pronoun SICH.
In the secondexample we have to select two differe~r<t verbs to render both(2a) and (2b) correctly into German 2~ .2.1 A first approximationAs a~i ra t  a~proximation the following scheme can beproposed ~ :E U V -~ V transitiv ~- + transitiv NP(R2') I-+traVnsitive I 1 ... t ~ -traVsitive~Jote that (RI') and (R2') must follow each other immediately,otherwise the environment in (R2') must be made explicit.Note also that verbs like INCREASE need not be mentioned atall: they can be marked in the lexicon as invariably+ transitive\] , to which the missing formal object shouldbe inserted on the German side by an other rule:(R3')transitiv _~ ~- transitiv /~  XConditions: X contains no NP;X may be O.As the final step, the correct German equivalent has to bedetermined by the English verb and the feature \[+ transit iv~or \[ - transitive~ ; to secure the proper translation we haveto provide appropriate lexicon entries for the rules:(L I )IL2 1 sTEIG N(L3) I+ RETURN ~ _transitive~UI+ ZUROCKBRINGEN\]transitive\] J(L4) ~__ RETURN ~ ZUROCKKEHREN--transitive~J > I-transitive~ 1In order to be able to cope with reflexives of variableverb stems like:CHANGE -- VER~NDERN ~__/ SICH 2\[NDERNMOVE - -  0BERTRAGEN ~JS ICH BEWEGENit is necessary to mark reflexives in (R3') by anadditional feature : Iv eltrans it iv reflexive 71/reXConditions: X contains no NP;X may be O.2.2 Clause boundariesThis basic schemehas to be made somewhat more precise.Consider:(5) AS data process ing needs have increased ,the  basle card 1.an@uase remained the  same.Without referring to the clause boundary after the wordINCREASED, the following NP (= subject of the next clause)would be interpreted as an object belonging to the verbINCREASED.Thus the environment in (RI') (and accordingly also in(R2') and (R3")) has to be further specified: in additionto requirement, that the NP immediately follows the verb,we must also demand that the NP may not be separatedfrom the verb by a sentence boundary.
This means that theNP must belong to the same clause as the verb.This can be done on the basis of the sentence analysis,which is motivated independently from the cu~r~rent problem,and the results of which remain accessible ~ .
Thus thefinal set of rules would read as follows:(RI)transitiv f ?
transitiv- -  - - -  _ _  N P(R2) !_+ tranVitivii ~.~!Z tranVsitiv I(R3) i- V iJ!\[+ transitiv .
'- J "~ I+ transitiv / reflexive ~IConditions: X contains no NP;X may be 0.7Symbol g~ means that we restrict the applicability of ourrules t~ one and the same clause.2.3 Passive-voice verbal constructionsFurther more we should also be able to treat sentenceslike the following:(4) I t  has been re turned  to the  in i t ia l  pos i t ion .
(4")Es i s t  zu der ursg~ruengli~hen Pos i t ion  zurueck-ggbracht  wordgn ~ .6(5) I f  the  d isk  has Seen mounted, s ta r t  themachine.
(5") Wenn die P la t te  mont ier t  worden i s t ,  s ta r ted ie  Maschine.In order to get the required feature \[ + transitive\] in spiteof the physical lack of a direct object NP in the terminalstring~ we have to' recognize passive-voice constructionsas such.The passive recognition should preeeed (RI) and shoulddiscover the object of the main verb, otherwise (R2)treats sentences like (4) and (5) as intransitives, afterwhich we have to eliminate the consequences of thismisinterpretation.
Presuming unique morphological markingof passive-voice the following recognition rule would besufficient for the present purpose:(R4) NP-SVnli i X transitiv rP~VP ver~" pas.s i ve\] \]-SConditions: X~ V contains no NPV4.
n.  .
, transltlv~ !I < 5 passiv~ \]i verD\[ vPX may be O.
(R4) preceeds (R1).For the further discussion note that the passi~v~ recognitionuneseapably involves hierarchical structures 6~ .3.1 Motion verbsThere are some subsidiary problems arising after the exchangeof the transitive form of a multifunctional verb againstits intransitive correspondence.Consider:(6) The temperature ha~ dropped rapidly.
(6 ' )  Die Temperatur hat ~allen 8e?a~sen schnel l .
(6") Die Tamparatar hat gcfa l len  ~chnell .Inspire of the correct translation of the main verb,sentence (6") is still false, because fallen - fiel - ~e-fallen counts as a motion verb, and as such it takes the~ a r y  verb sein in perfect tense.
Therefore provisionmust be made to provide the proper auxiliaries for themotion verbs in perfext tense.
The actual exchange of theauxiliary might be postponed to a later step, if theappropriate marking is provided by the lexicon.E.G.
(L2') I-MOUNT \] FSTEIGEN \]~--transitivell "'-~- I\[- transitive\]i- - -  L\[+ motion\] J(L4')transitive\]J .rZU~OCKKEH~I~- transitive~l !t,t ,,,otio  jSince the auxiliary selection has to be done for all motionverbs in perfect tense, i.e.
also for the non-homographictype likehas arrived i.st angekommenhas gone ist gegangen etc.,it is practical to place the auxiliary ~election behind(RI) - (R3) and even after the insertion of the improved,intransitive entries ((L2'),(R5)(L~' and the like):Vn - VnX HABEN X transitiv~ SEIN X transitiv; motion \] motion\] .verb ~erbThus (R5) would automatically pmoduce:(6'") Pie Temperat~r i s t  gc fa l len  ~chnz l l .3.2 Order of composite verbsLet us consider the order of primary elements of compositeverbs like:STOP STEHEN BLEIBENDROP FALLEN LASSENIn order to be able to manipulate each unit separately itis expedient to set up two words on the German side:STOP ~'STEHENBLEIBEN%DROP /FALLEN"LASSEN ~At this point however we have to  ask which of the twopossibilities is the preferable order:STEHEN or BLEIBEN ?BLEIBEN STEHENWhen generating the final German word order, all compositeverbs have to be inverted.This inversion routine consists of a set of rules (7) .The rule for subordinate clauses operates aecording to thefollowing basic scheme:(R6) SD: IX - Iv X - Vn l -  IVrestll- ~erbSC: 1 2 0 4 + 3Conditions: S is a subordinate clause(i.e.
it is dominated by another symbol);X may be an empty string;V n is the last part of the verb.An inversion is necessary in any case independently of thepresent issue, also for sentences like (1) - (4), forwhich we have tac i t l y  assumed the existence of a verbinversion routine \[ 7 7 .We should like to translate correctly sentences like:(71(7')I t  aause~ the  machine to s top.zu~stehen7 Es vz ran lass t  d ie Masahine ~bleiben~At the f irst sight it appears that sentence(Ta') Es veran lass t  d ie  Maschine zu s tehen  b lg iben.sounds better  than:(7b')  Es veran las~t  d ie  Maschine zu b lg iben stghen.But if we make the verb inversion rule (R6) also for (7)appl icable the verb wil l  be automatical ly inverted.
Thus(7b') is preferable to (7a'), since (R6) yields the correcttranslat ion out of (7b'), but not out of (7a').
All whatwe have to do is to treat the inf init ive zu bleiben as a unit:(7" 1 Es vgran lass t  dig Masahine zu b lg ibzn stghen.verb \[..~J2nd application:n=1(7"') E~ vgran lass t  d ie  Masa'hing ~tchen " z~ b lg iben.
(R6) applies first vacuously, i.e.
it effects only the marking,but not the physical  sequence of the constituents, since V ?
.rest is an empty string.
The variable zu bleiben is the remalnaerof the verb constituent after the separat ion of the lastindependent morphological  unit.
At the second application,there is a V t produeed by step 1, (R6) places the no ,  last -and only - m~er  of the verb constituent after Vrest ~ .10These considerations show also the crucial importance ofthe ordering of rules and subroutines.
We can solve thesequencing of the newly inserted compound verbs withminimal effort, if we have the verb inversion routines runafter the disambiguation of the transit ive/ intransit iveverbs.4.0 Theoretical implicationsFinally I should like to point out a theoretical  implicationof the present problem which might have bearings on l inguisticanalysis in general.In a formal l inguistic analysis it is unavoidable to set outfrom the information directly available in the terminal string.This primary information is organised necessari ly in a l inearfashion.As the analysis proceeds the possibi l i ty emerges to organizethe l inguistic information in a non-l inear, hierarchical  way.The results of the analysis steps can be used to find andmark the boundaries of the clauses, to recognize the individualconstituents within the larger units, i.e.
to build up atentative constituent structure.As the disambiguation of verb with mult iple meaning shows,we have to rely on hierarchical ly organized informationin order to make the proper choice between transit ive andintransitive usages even in this rather simple ease.
To solvethe polysemy of the verbs in questions, we have to be ableto find out that an NP is dominated directly by a VP andthat this VP dominates directly a verb, which is in turnmarked in an specific way.Our transformation terminology, and the fact, that the systemslends itself readily for such a reinterpretat ion suggest ourconclusion: We claim that the MT-system described aboveuses transformational rules.This claim is supported1.
by the hierarchical  organization of grammatical information,which is the computational representat ion of phrasemarkers (trees).2.
- and this is the main point - by our reinterpretat ionof the computational algorithms as mapping of phrasemarkers into phrase markers \[2\] \[3\]IIThis impl icat ion seems interesting for the fol lowingreason.
The MT-system of IBM Germany has grown out ofthe intent ion to create a translat ing tool for practicalpurposes.
The system was developed in a basical ly empiricalmanner; problems were attacked at points, where we hopedto f ind the easiest way to the solution.
A general frameof action has been invented, rules have been worked outand ordered coding considerations have been made, but itis only in retrospect that the theoretical  evaluation ofthe system has become possible.On the whole the system, heterogeneous as it is, resemblesthe fulcrum type of MT-scheme, operating on a differentlanguage pair  as Garvin's system \[1\] .
We have tried toshow, however, that even the empir ical  approach felt theneed for mult id imensional  structuring, and certain rulesset up on empir ical  considerat ions - e.g.
those treatingverb with mult ip le meaning - turn out to be mappings ofphrase markers into phrase markers in the transformationalsense.- .

.IZSummary_In the past years the Department of Basic ResearchIBM Germany developed an experimental Machine Translat ionSystem to translate technical texts on data processingand electronics from English into German.
This MT-systemdisplays some resemblances with the Fulcrum-type ofsystems, but at least some of its subroutines containalso transformational devices.The treatment of verbs with mult iple meaning of the typeCHANGE - VER~NDERN - SICH ~NDERN is one of these cases.
Thecorrect recognit ion of the passive voice and direct objectspresuppose hierarchical ly organised and permanently accessiblesyntactic markers.While presenting this rather special case it has beenattempted to show some further aspects as well as thegeneral functioning of the system.The MT-SYstem represents a team work: the author of thepresent paper thanks especial ly Mrs. Brigitte Schirmerand Mr. Reinhart Herzog for reading and crit ic iz ingthe first version of the manuscript.13Footnotes?????
?Our German translation may deviate occasionally, e.g.with regard to prepositions, from the common usage,since we draw the examples from our actual output._Th.e._following verbs display the same regularity:Typ 1: t rans i t ive~ref lex iveCHANGE VERKNDERNREVOLVE DREHENINCREASE ERHOHENDECREASE VERMINDERNMOVE OBERTRAGENetc .SICH ANDERNSICH DREHENSICH ERHOHENSICH VERMINDERNSICH BEWEGENTyp 2: transitive-vintransitiveMOUNT MONTIEREN STEIGENRETURN ZUROCKBRINGEN ZUROCKKEHRENCONTINUE FORTSETZEN FORTFAHRENDROP FALLEN LASSEN FALLENetc .In our notation symbols refer to code information,provided primarily by the word assignment routines,and - as we have already pointed out - improved bythe syntactic component of the system.
We differentiate Fcategory symbols from features by putting the latter in \[The symbol X denotes strings having no relevance tothe rules.Although the description of the voluminous analysisis beyond the scope of the present discussion, itsconcept influences also the treatment of verbs withmultiple meaning.
E.g.
in (RI') we must know whether theconstituent NP comprises initial adverbs on not.
Todinstinguish an initial adverb dominated by an NP froman adverb merely preeeeding on NP (but no?
dominatedby it) is extremely complicated.
If this distinctionis not made, adverbs standing betw%en verbs and NP-smust be jumped over.We cannot deal here with all problems arising, whiletranslating the sentences.
We shall return to the problemhow to generate the correct German word order in 3.2.The actual machine realisation does not affect the basicproperties of the passive recognition (Rq); since in theactual system English verbs~ which may be transitive andJ14?
?intransitive, are provided uniformly with a transitiveGerman eorrespondence in the first place, it is enoughto recognize the passives and approve the given choiceby taking no action.
The actual recovery of the deepobject of passive sentences seems to be redundant, sinceEnglish passives correspond normally to passives in German.The rule appying to main clauses is more complicated.Therefore we have chosen the simpler rule for subordinateclauses, which suffices to illustrate the principleof verb conversion.A similar reasoning speaks for separating prefixes frommain verbs and placing prefixes after the verb stems:BRINGEN ZUROCK, KEHREN ZUROCK usw.
The entries in machinelexicon are actually in this sequence.15\[3\]\[4\]!>\]BibliographyGarvin, P.L.
