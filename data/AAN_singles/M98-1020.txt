System architecture of Oki MET system is basically the same as the one for the NEsystem for MUC-7 evaluation although recognition rules of both systems are dierent because oflanguage dierence (Japanese and English).Oki MET system [3][4] is based on term recognition rules of surface linguistic expressions andparse trees which is generated by the parsing module of MT system.
The MET system rstlyidenties term boundaries by Japanese character types.
Named Entities are recognized using aJapanese sux list and a word list for each NE type.
After recognition of surface patterns, eachsentence of a text is parsed and NE elements are recognized by structural pattern rules.
Thestructural pattern recognition rules are described in GDL and are executed on the GDL system.SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONOki MET system consists of a surface pattern recognition module, a SGML tag processing module,a structural pattern recognition module and ltering program to convert internal expression ofparser to surface expression.
Architecture of the system is shown in Figure 1.In the surface pattern recognition module, the system rstly identies term boundaries byJapanese character types such as Hiragana, Kanji, Number and so on.
Then, NE elements arerecognized using a Japanese sux list and a word list for each NE type.
The detected NE elementsin a text are SGML-tagged.
In the SGML tag processor, these tags and original SGML tags ina text are embedded in their adjacent words for morphological and syntax analysis.
Each tag-processed sentence is parsed by the morphological and syntax analyzer which is originally used inthe MT system.
After parsing, structural patterns are recognized by structural pattern recognitionrules, although the number of rules is not much in the current implementation.
These rules aredescribed in GDL and are executed on the GDL system after parsing.
The recognized patterns areexpressed in node attributes of a parse tree.
In order to obtain NE results, node information of NEtags is extracted and embedded in a text as SGML tags by the NE lter.1SGML Tag ProcessorSurface PatternRecognition ModuleMorphological andSyntax Analyzer+Structural PatternRecognition ModuleNE ResultsNE FilterInput Text Segmentation RulesName Recognition RulesFigure 1: Overview of the Oki MET systemRECOGNITION OF NE ELEMENTSSegmentationAt surface level processing, term boundaries of an input text is identied by Japanese charactertypes which are Hiragana and some symbols such as brackets and Japanese punctuation.
The sys-tem rstly extracts a sequence of Japanese characters, which are not Hiragana characters, Japanesecomma \?"

Some sequences of Hiragana characters registeredin a list of functional Hiragana words and a list of proper nouns are merged with their adjacentterms.In the following example, ??????

?Table 1: Term ListsThe divided basic terms are merged by concatenation rules and then NE elements and theirtype such as a person, an organization and a location is recognized.
Figure 2 shows concatenationrules which are applied in this order.

Person name (p) + ps(2) on + os !
Organization name (o)(3) ln + ls !
Location name (l)(4) ln + ps !

Organization name (o)(9) ln !
Location name (l)Figure 2: Sample Concatenation RulesAccording to the rules (1), (2) and (3), each type of an NE element is identied by a sequenceof a basic name and a sux.
A sequence of a location name and a person name sux is recognizedas a person name by rule (4) because a location name is often used as a person name.
Rule (5),(6) and (7) show that a person / organization / location name and a sequence of an organizationname modier are important cues to identify an organization name.
Rules (8) describes thatan organization name is identied as an NE element when it has no sux information.
Rules(9) describes the case of a location name.
Stop word lists are used to remove an element fromcandidates for NE elements.
When a candidate for NE elements contains an element of a stop wordlist, it might be a general noun, not a proper noun.3Heuristics of Name RecognitionAfter recognition of NE elements at surface level, some heuristics are applied to each sentence toidentify more NE elements.
Some of them are as follows: The words \?
", \?
", \?"
and \?"
are merged with a location name. If Japanese characters \?"
and \?"
are independent element after segmentation, they arerecognized as a location name. If one character country names such as \?
", \?"
and \?"
appear in a sequence, they arerecognized as a location name. A person name without a person name sux is not recognized as an NE element becausemost of person names accompany with a sux.Table 2 shows examples of Name recognition from divided form.
Each tag name in this tableindicates that the tagged element is an element of Name of list presented in Table .
For example,xxx of the tagged element \< pn xxx>" shows is an element of a person name list.Original form Divided form Results??????

?>Table 2: Term ListsTag-processing for ParsingOriginal texts are SGML-tagged ones and NE elements are also SGML-tagged after Surface patternrecognition.
In order to parse a SGML-tagged text, these tags have to be concealed.
In a parse tree,the tag information is expressed in node attribute of a parse tree, therefore, system can handlesinformation obtained at surface level pattern during parsing.4Name Recognition from Parse TreeAfter parsing3, structural pattern rules are applied to a parse tree in order to recognize NE elements.Semantic information utilized in parsing rules is used to correct the scope of NE elements.
Forexample, if there is an unknown word between a person name and a word which has a meaningof human, the sequence of words are recognized as a person name.
In the following sentence, \??"
is recognized as a person name in surface name recognition and \????"
has a meaning ofhuman in a parse tree level, then \????????"
is recognized as a person name.??????????????????????
?Post-processingAfter structural pattern recognition, information of the NE tags is extracted from the parse treeand added to the pattern tagged text.DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSWe took the same kind of approach to develop the Oki MET-2 system as the NE system for MUC-7 although target languages are dierent.
That is, both systems consist of a surface linguisticpattern recognition module and a structural pattern recognition module using parsing module ofMT system.
However, performance of the Japanese NE system is higher than that of the EnglishNE system.
It is because of the dierence of uniformity of expressions in texts.
Most of the personnames in Japanese newspaper articles have a term of respect or title.
On the other hand, in Englishones, the rst NE element has a term of respect or title but its repeated ones are represented bythe name only.The parsing module of the Japanese-English MT system has been originally developed forlanguage transformation, therefore, a part of tree structure of the original language is sometimesconverted to structure of the target language during parsing.
That is, some parts of tree structureexpress sentence structure of the target language and others express sentence structure of theoriginal language.
This caused some problems of pattern matching of Name recognition on a parsetree.We have participated the MET-2 task in Japanese which has only the NE task.
We are plan-ning to apply our IE technology developed for MUC-7 tasks to a practical Japanese informationextraction system.
Moreover, it will be good to participate Japanese CO, TE, TR and ST tasks ifthey will be dened in the next conference.References[1] TIPSTER TEXT PROGRAM Phrase II, DARPA, (1996).3In order to parse a SGML-tagged text, tag information has to be concealed like the Tag-processing of the MUC-7NE system.5[2] Proceedings of 6th Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6), DARPA, (1995).
