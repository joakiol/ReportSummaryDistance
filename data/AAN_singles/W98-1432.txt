SYSTEM DEMONSTRATIONOVERVIEW OF GBGEN*Thierry EtchegoyhenLATLUniversity of GenevaetchegoyhenQlatl.unige.chThomas WehrleFPSEUniversity of Genevawehrle~fapse.unige.ch1 IntroductionThis paper presents an overview of the GBGen system, a sentence realizer currently developpedfor French.
The system is strictly deterministic, .e.
it maps semantic structures to surface formswithout either simulating parallelism or using backtracking, and the performances are accordinglyextremely satisfying.
It is procedural, based on Government & Binding Theory (Chomsky 1981):several levels of syntactic representation are defined, on which configurational searches and trans-formations apply.GBGen is large-scale, based on a lexicon of approximately 185.000 entries (more or less 24.000lexemes together with inflected word forms).
The system covers simple and complex sentences,complex grammatical phenomena like unbounded ependencies, raising and control structures,intrasentential coreference, cliticization , modifiers (both clausal and prepositional) and main casesof coordination.
It also computes Several morphosyntactic phenomena hke agreement, contractionsor pronoun lexicalization.
In what follows, we present he general characteristics of the softwareand detailits majors components.2: Overview of the systemTwo main components form the GBGen system.
The pseudo-semantic component, which defines thesemantic input of the generation process and the syntactic omponent, which produces a sentence(in written or spoken format) from the pseudo-semantic specifications.
We describe the mainaspects of these components in the following sections.?
2 .1  Pseudo-semant icsThe input of the generation process is dubbed Pseudo-Semantics.
A pseudo-semantic structure(PSS) contains both lexical and abstract information (whence the term pseudo).
A PSS can be oneof the following four semantic objects: CLS, DPS, SLS and CHS.CLSs (clause structures) represent events and states.
They contain a predicate (usually a verbor an adjective), functional information such as Tense and Aspect, ?
and other PSS objects thatparticipate in the interpretation f the CLS (e.g., elements bearing the thematic roles assigned bythe predicate, etc.).
DPSs (DP structures) semantically characterize noun phrases.
They consist*The GBGen project is supported by grant n o 12-50797.97 from the Fonds National Sulssc pour la RechercheSclentifique.

SLSs (Semantic Label Structures) consist of a semantic label/function andan associated PSS.
Roughly, these objects are used to characterize thematic-role bearing elements,modifiers, or the semantic function of adverbs and adjectives.
Finally, CHSs (Characteristic Struc-tures) are used to represent adjectives and adverbs.
All these elements can be combined to obtainthe desired semantic representation, but can also be used autonomously (a useful characteristic forthe use of pseudo-semantics for machine translation).As an illustration, the (slightly simplified) PSS for the sentence (la) is (lb):(1)a.

The main object is a CLS with the pred-icate kill.
Tense is represented through a modified version of Reichenbach's analysis (\[Reichenbach47\]), where E is the event time point and S the speech time point, the two points being eitherequal or ordered with a precedence r lation.
Combining Tense with non-lexical aspect (progressive,perfective) leads to verbal tenses.
The other functional information states that the sentence to begenerated is a declarative, positive and passiveone.
The other elements that form part of the eventare (unorderly)'listed in the Satellites list.
The first one is an SLS with a thematic role Theme anda DPS bearing this role.
The DPS has a lexical Property dog and an Operator some_ individual(the interpretation ofDPSs follows the generalized quantifiers analysis, see \[Barwise & Cooper 81\]).A CHS appears in the Satellite list of the DPS, restricting the set denotation of the property.
Thesecond SLS in the above representation contains a semantic label Eval truth and an "adverbial"CHS.
The label states that the semantic function of the CHS is an evaluation of the truth of thestatement expressed in the CLS.
Finally, a spatial SLS is present in the Satellite list, with a spatiallabel In and a DPS with a lexical Property bed and an Operator demonstrative.289Notice, to conclude this section, that the PSSs are not syntactic in nature.
They are unordered,closed class elements are abstractly represented, and recursiveness in these structures representsno more than minimal semantic scope.
Hence, the efficiency of the System does not come from the?
:fact that the input contains yntactic information, but rather from the way syntactic realization isdone.2.2 Syntactic ComponentThe syntactic processing has three main steps.
First, we map the pseudo-semantic information intoa D-structure.
This is achieved by the projection subcomponent.
Briefly, each ?element of the PSSwhich has a categorial feature (X=V,N,...) is mapped into a local tree, as in (2):XP(Maximal ?Projection).
Spec(ifier) X Compl(ement)(Head)The Head/Projection distinction should be seen as a convenient presentational device.
Actually,a Projection is a record of the properties of the lexical item.
Thus, combination of XPs to createbigger structures can be done by using properties of heads (e.g., subcategorization).
Spec andCompl are ordered lists which serve to combine all the subtrees created in the projection component,according to the properties of the subtrees.
To give a concrete xample, assuming the PSS in (lb),the system creates the D-structure in (3):(3) \[ cP \[ TP {past} \[ vP \[ AdvP probably\] \[ v kill (perf.
; passive) \] \[ DP a \[ NP \[ AdjP big\]dog\] \] \[AdvP \[Plain \[Dpthis \ [Npbed\ ] \ ] \ ]  \  \ \]\]CP is the top node of each sentence ?
and always takes a TP as its complement, which containstense information and the subject of the clause in most cases (in the example, a passive sentence,the subject is omitted).
VP contains the verb, so-called VP-adverbs in its Spec list, and comple-ments/adjunct s in its Compl list.
In our example, the latter list contains the theme noun phraseand an adjunct (marked with an AdvP), which is the prepositional phrase in this bed.
Nous phrasesare formed with an NP, which contains the noun, its complements and adjectives, and a DP, theprojection Of determiners, which subcategorizes for NPs.Movement and Binding algorithms apply once the D-structure has been created.
They merelyconsist in searches in the tree and the movement operation is the generic Move a instruction,familiar to GB practici0ners.
In this respect, syntactic processing in the system is configurational.Going back to our example, the object?
of the passive verbal form is moved to the first (Spec of)TP with finite T, leaving a coindexed empty category, and the obtained S-structure is the followingone:  ,(4) \[ cP \[ TP \[ DP, a \[ m~ \[ AdjP big\] dog\] \] {past} \[ vP \[ AdvP probably\] kill (perf.
; passive) \[ DPIe\] \[ AdvP \[ PP in \[ DP this \[ NP bed\] \] \] \] \] \] \]Finally, we apply the morphological procedure, which computes agreement, selects the cor-rect verbal inflected forms, and treats other phenomena like determiner contraction or pronounlexicalization.
In our simple example, we would obtain the final sentence in (al).2903 Concluding RemarksGBGen is written in Modula-2, developed under Open VMS on a DEC-Alpha system, and alsoruns on PC-Windows.
The system is being used (or will be used in the near future) in the followingsystems/projects:?

This systemuses the IPS parser (\[Wehrli 92\]) to parse English, French, German or ItMian inputs andGBGen to generate into the target language.
The French-to-French version of the system,used as a test tool for GBGen, is available on the web.

The system will soon be part of the SAFRAN project (\[HamelWehrli 97\], \[ttamel & Vandeventer 98\]), a toomox for computer assisted language learning.We presented an overview of GBGen, a large-scale domain-independent syntactic generator.
Atpresent, the system covers a large part of French grammar artd deals with complex grammaticalphenomena in a highly efficient way.
The system is also strongly generic, which means that itsextension to other languages hould not require major changes in the procedures.
A tentativeorientation to English generation has shown that the system needs only small parametric variationsin the procedures to generate major constructions of this language.
Given the promising results ofthe approach to surface realization we have choosen, we will pursue the development of the GBGensystem by extending its grammatical coverage and adding several languages to it.References\[Barwise & Cooper 81\] Barwise, J.

Note that the program does not make use of all the capabilities of GBGen,since not all the relevant information is at present extracted from the parse.
Major syntactic constructions arenonetheless treated, and the system gives a representative picture of the generator.~Informati6n on the CSTAR- I I  project can be found at http://wrtrev.is.cs.crnu.edu/estar/CSTARoll.htrnl.291
