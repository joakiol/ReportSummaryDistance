Focus of the presentlyreported work was to investigate the inter-action between an ontology and linguisticanalysis of indefinite and indefinite nomi-nal phrase for both the incremental annota-tion of characters in folktales text, includ-ing some inference based co-reference res-olution, and the incremental population ofthe ontology.
This in depth study was doneat this early stage using only a very smalltextual base, but the demonstrated feasibil-ity and the promising results of our small-scale experiment are encouraging us to de-ploy the strategy on a larger text base, cov-ering more linguistic phenomena in a mul-tilingual fashion.1 IntroductionIn this submission we present on-going workdealing with the automatic annotation of charac-ters in folktales.
Focus of the investigation lies inusing an iterative approach that combines an in-cremental ontology population and an incremen-tal linguistic annotation.
Our starting point isgiven by an in-house developed ontology, whichis having as its core the description of family rela-tions, but also some typical elements of folktales,like supernatural entities, etc.The use of ontologies in the field of folktales isnot new, but to our knowledge no attempt has beendone so far to use ontologies in combination withnatural language processing for automatizing theannotation of folktales, or for automatically popu-lating a knowledge base of characters of folktales.The work by (Peinado et al, 2004) is dealing infirst line with the Proppian functions that charac-ter can play and is also geared towards generationof interactive stories.
(Zoelllner-Weber, 2008) ismuch closer to our aim, and in fact the author isproposing lines of research we want to implementin the near future, but her work is explicitly notdealing with the automation of annotation, andshe is also not concerned with linguistic annota-tion in particular, but with general TEI annota-tion1 of text structures.At the present stage of development, we re-stricted ourselves to investigate the role indefi-nite and definite nominal phrases (NPs) can playfor the detection of characters and their storageas instances of ontology classes.
This decisionis echoing well-established investigations on onepossible function of indefinite NPs, namely to in-troduce a new referent in a discourse (see amongothers (von Heusinger, 2000)), whereas indefiniteNPs can be used in the subsequent text to referback to the introduced referential entities.
Thisfact has also been acknowledged in the field offolktales and narratives and (Herman, 2000), forexample, stressed the importance of analyzing se-quences of referring expressions for achieving amore complete and accurate view on the role ofparticipants in narratives.Discourse models resulting from the sequenceof referring expressions can thus support the com-prehension of narratives (see (Herman, 2000),p.962).
Agreeing with this study, we further thinkthat the automated analysis of referential expres-1TEI stands for ?Text Encoding Initiative, see www.tei-c.org30sions in folktales, delivering essential elementsfor the character models used in the interpretationof narratives, can be of help in the automated anal-ysis of the whole folktale, and more generally forthe automated analysis of narratives.While (Herman, 2000) treats the role ofanaphora used in transcripts of ghost stories, wedeal (for the time being) only with the relationbetween characters introduced by indefinite NPsand their subsequent enunciation by definite NPs.In the next sections we present the main com-ponents of the current version of our system.
Wediscuss also the results of a first evaluation study,and conclude with indication on future work.2 The OntologyAs mentioned above, our starting point is an on-tology, developed at our lab.
This ontology willbe made publicly available, after merging it withfurther ontological elements relevant to the fieldof narratives, as those are for example describedin (Zoelllner-Weber, 2008), and associating itsclasses and relations with elements relevant forthe linguistic and semantic annotation of folk-tales, as described for example in (Scheidel andDeclerck, 2010).The class hierarchy and the associated relations(or properties) are equipped with natural languagelabels and comments.
The labels are available infour languages: Bulgarian, English, German andRussian.
But our work is dealing for the time be-ing only with English.An example of class of the ontology, with itslabels is given just below:<owl:Class rdf:about="#BiolDaughter"><owl:equivalentClass><owl:Class><owl:intersectionOf rdf:parseType="Collection"><owl:Restriction><owl:onProperty rdf:resource="#hasBiolParent"/><owl:onClass rdf:resource="#BiolParent"/><owl:minQualifiedCardinalityrdf:datatype="&xsd;nonNegativeInteger">1</owl:minQualifiedCardinality></owl:Restriction><owl:Restriction><owl:onProperty rdf:resource="#hasGender"/><owl:hasValue>f</owl:hasValue></owl:Restriction></owl:intersectionOf></owl:Class></owl:equivalentClass><rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#BiolChild"/><rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Daughter"/><rdfs:comment>The class of biological daughther isa subclass of biological child and of daughter.This class designates all biological daughters.Each member of this class has gender femaleand at least one biological parent.</rdfs:comment><dc:language xml:lang="bg">&#1073;&#1080;&#1086;&#1083;&#1086;&#1075;&#1080;&#1095;&#1085;&#1072; &#1044;&#1098;&#1097;&#1077;&#1088;&#1103;</dc:language><dc:language xml:lang="de">biologische Tochter</dc:language><dc:language xml:lang="en">biological Daughter</dc:language><dc:language xml:lang="ru">&#1073;&#1080;&#1086;&#1083;&#1086;&#1075;&#1080;&#1095;&#1077;&#1089;&#1082;&#1072;&#1103; &#1044;&#1086;&#1095;&#1100;</dc:language></owl:Class>The ontology also encodes inference rules thatallow establishing automatically family relationsbetween entities (characters) that have been storedat the instance level, which is the process of on-tology population resulting from detection in thetext.1.
hasParent(?x, ?x1), hasParent(?x, ?x2), hasParent(?y,?x1), hasParent(?y, ?x2), hasGender(?x, ?f?
), notE-qual(?x, ?y)?
Sister(?x)2.
Daughter(?d) , Father(?f) , Son(?s) ?
hasBrother(?d,?s), hasChild(?f, ?s), hasChild(?f, ?d), hasSister(?s,?d)The first rule is about class inference.
It statesthat if two different individuals in the ontology(represented by the variables x and y) share thesame parents (represented by the variables x1 andx2) and if the gender of one of the two individualsis female, then this individual can be consideredas an instance of the ontology class Sister.According to the second rule, various relations(or properties) can be inferred from the fact thatwe have three individuals (represented by the vari-ables d, f and s) that are instances of the classes31Daughter, Father and Son respectively.
The firstinferred relations state that the Daughter has theSon as her Brother and the Son reciprocally hasthe Daughter as his Sister.
In addition, the Fatheris being assigned twice the HASCHILD property,once for the Daughter and second for the Son.3 Processing StepsWe submit first a folktale, here the ?Magic SwanGeese?2, to a linguistic processing engine (theNooJ platform, see (Silberztein, 2003)), applyingto the text nominal phrases recognition rules (in-cluding coordination), which are differentiated inbeing either indefinite or definite (we do not con-sider pronouns for the time being).
All annotatedNPs are indexed with ID numbers.In the following step, our algorithm extractsfrom the whole annotated text the nominal headsof the indefinite NPs and compares them with thelabels present in the ontology.
In case a match canbe established, the nominal head of this phrase isused for populating the corresponding ontologyclass as an individual and the text is annotatedwith the nominal head being a (potential) char-acter, as can be seen in the annotation examplebelow, where the reader can observe that the (po-tential) characters are also enumerated, this timeon the base of the (unique) ID they get duringthe ontology population phase.
In this step thus,all candidate characters in text are automaticallymarked-up with both linguistic and character in-formation derived from the ontology.<text>There lived<NPCOORD id="z_coord_ph1" Nb="p" HEAD1="man"HEAD2="woman" Type="and"><NP id="indef_ph1" SPEC="a" HEAD="man"Gender="m" Num="s"><CHAR id="ch1" TYPE="man" Gender="m"Num="s">an old man</CHAR></NP>and<NP id="indef_ph2" SPEC="a" HEAD="woman"2http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The Magic Swan GeeseGender="f" Num="s"><CHAR id="ch2" TYPE="woman" Gender="f"Num="s">an old woman</CHAR></NP></NPCOORD>;they had<NPCOORD id="z_coord_ph2" Nb="p" HEAD1="daughter" HEAD2="son" Type="and"><NP id="indef_ph3" SPEC="a"HEAD="daughter" Gender="f" Num="s"><CHAR id="ch3" TYPE="daughter"Gender="f" Num="s">a daughter</CHAR></NP>and<NP id="indef_ph4" SPEC="a" HEAD="son"Gender="m" Num="s"><CHAR id="ch4" TYPE="son" Gender="m"Num="s">a little son</CHAR></NP></NPCOORD>In the next step, the inference rules of the ontol-ogy are applied to the candidate characters (the in-dividuals stored so far in the knowledge base).
Inthe particular tale we are analysing the class asso-ciated with the potential character ch2 (Woman)can be equated with the class Mother and its as-sociated string in the label (mother), so that alloccurrences of the two strings in the text can bemarked as referring to the same character.Also some relations are established betweenthe individuals by the application of the inferencerules described in the ontology section above:Wife of, Mother Of, etc.
(together with thestrings listed in the labels).
If the related stringsare found in definite NPs in the text, the cor-responding segment can then be annotated by32our linguistic processing engine with the origi-nal character identifier.
In the example below, thereader can see that on the base of the inferencerules, the string mother in the definite NP (withID DEF PH6) is referred to ch2 (see the first an-notation example above for the first occurrence ofch2).<NP id="def_ph6" SPEC="the" HEAD="mother"Gender="f" Num="s">the mother</NP>said: "Daughter, daughter, we are goingto work; we shall bring you back<NP id="indef_ph7" SPEC="a" HEAD="bun"Gender="n" Num="s"><CHAR id="ch6" TYPE="bun" Gender="n"Num="s">a little bun</CHAR></NP>, sew you <NP id="indef_ph8" SPEC="a"HEAD="dress" Gender="n" Num="s"><CHAR id="ch7" TYPE="dress"Gender="n" Num="s">a little dress</CHAR></NP>The same remark is valid for the ch3 (?adaughter?
introduced in the first sentence of thetale).
In the definite NP with ID 12, the string(daughter) is occurring in the context of a def-inite NP, and thus marked as referring to ch3.The string (girl) is occurring four times in thecontext of definite NPs (with IDs 18, 25, 56 and60) and for all those 4 occurrences the inferencedriven mark-up of the nominal head with ch3turns out to be correct.In this annotation example, the reader can alsosee that the heads of all indefinite NPs are firstconsidered as potential characters.
A preliminaryfiltering of such expression like dress is not pos-sible, since in folktales, every object can be anactant.
So for example in this tale, an oven, anapple tree or a river of milk are play-ing an important role, and are characters involvedin specific actions.
Our filtering is rather takingplace in a post-processing phase: strings that getonly once related to a potential character ID andwhich are not involved in an action are at the enddiscarded.The next steps are dealing with finding otheroccurrences of the potential characters (withindefinite NPs), or to exclude candidates from theset.4 Evaluation of the approachIn order to be able to evaluate our approach,even considering that we are working on a verysmall text base, we designed a first basic test dataand annotated manually the folktale ?The magicswan geese?
with linguistic and character anno-tation.
The linguistic annotation is including co-referential information.
In the longer term, weplan to compare our work applied to more folk-tales with a real gold standard, the UMIREC cor-pus (http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/57507)Our evaluation study shows results in terms ofcorrect detection of tale characters in compari-son with the manually annotated data.
Eight ofthe real characters were correctly classified by thetool.
Three of the instances are actually charac-ters but they were not detected.
One candidate isnot a character according to the manually anno-tated data, but the system classified it as charac-ter.
Seven entities were correctly detected as noncharacters.
On this small basis, we calculated theaccuracy of the tool, which is 79%.
We also com-puted the precision, the recall and the F-measure.The precision amounts to 88%; the recall to 73%;and the value of the balanced F-measure is 80%.So these metrics confirm what the accuracy hasbeen already expressing: the results are encour-aging.Looking at the errors made by the tool, we knowthat it does not consider the characters that arementioned only one time.
In our text, a hedge-hog occurs only once.
However, the human intu-ition is that it is a character and differs from thephrases a bun and a dress, which have just de-scriptive function.
In a next version of the tool,it will be checked if the head of an indefinite NP,which is present only once in the text, is havingan active semantic role, like Agent.
In this case, itcan be considered as a character.Another problem of our actual approach is thatwe do not consider yet the possessive phrases andpronominal expressions.
Precise analysis of theseanaphoric expressions will improve the approach33in augmenting the number of occurrences of can-didate characters.
We also expect the availabilityof related instances in the knowledge base to helpin resolving pronominal co-reference phenomena.The applied method does not detect one of themain characters in the sample text namely theswan-geese.
The swan-geese are introduced in thediscourse only via a definite noun phrase.
If thereare some equivalent phrases, for example occur-ring in the title of the tale, they can be annotatedas character by the tool.
An additional problemwe have, is the fact that our NP grammar has ana-lyzed the words swan and geese as separate nounsand not as a compound noun.
So that the linguis-tic analysis for English compounds has to be im-proved.5 Conclusion and future workOur in depth investigation of the interaction of anontology and language processing tools for thedetection of folktale characters and their use forincrementally populating an ontology seems to bepromising, and it has allowed for example to asso-ciate a unique character ID to occurrences of dif-ferent nominal heads, on the base of their inferredsemantic identity.
A possible result of our workwould lie in the constitution of larger databasecontaining characters of narratives extracted au-tomatically from text.We plan to tackle the processing of pronominaland possessive expressions for completing the co-reference task.
We plan also to extend our work toother languages, and we already started to do thisfor anaother folktale in German, in which muchmore complex family relationships are involved(the German version of the tale ?Father Frost?
).But more challenging will be to deal with lan-guages, which do not know have the differencebetween indefinite and definite NPs.AcknowledgmentsThe work presented in this paper has been partlysupported by the R&D project.
