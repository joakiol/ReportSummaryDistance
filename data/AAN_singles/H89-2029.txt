Summary of Session 7 -- Natural Language (Part 2)Madeleine Bates, chairBBN Systems & Technologies Corp.In this session, Ralph Weischedel of BBN reported on work advancing the stateof the art in multiple underlying systems, i.e., translating an understood queryor command into a program to produce an answer from one or moreapplication systems.
This work addresses one of the key bottlenecks to makingNL (and speech) systems truly applicable.
Systematic translation techniquesfrom logical form of an English input to commands to carry out the requesthave previously been worked out only for relational databases, but is extendedhere in both number of underlying systems and their type.Rebecca Passonneau of UNISYS repoprted on joint work in interfacing the NLprocessing and knowledge-based processing of the PUNDIT systen.
Shepresented a fundamental trade-off in computational stragegies typically usedfor NL systems (generate-and-test )  and those used for knowledgereprepresentation and reasoning systems (highy indexed networks), with thegoal of creating more intelligent search algorithms and an increased ability torecover from failures in processing.Yorick Wilks of New Mexico State reported on extensions to the ViewGensystem for bel ief ascription.
These extensions allow intensional objectidenti f icat ion, and have applications to battle environments,  such as asituation in which we believe that enemy radar shows two of our ships to bethe same ship.
To properly model this kind of situation, it is necessary, ineffect, for the system to reason about the hostile agent's beliefs using a singleentity, while reasoning about its own beliefs knowing that same entity to bedual.Robert Wi lensky discussed plans to develop a "consultant kit" that would allowone to build an intelligent, NL-capable consultant for any domain by givingthe appropriate knowledge and vocabulary to an "empty" version of the UNICConsultant system.
The work also involves a new natural language analyzer(HERMAN) and a new text understanding system (MANDI).Bonnie Webber described a study of deictic pronouns that refer to theinterpretation of one or more clauses, and compared their use in Italian and inEnglish, concluding that their referents come from the right frontier of thediscourse model as it evolves.This session has the particular distinction of including a paper in theproceedings which was not presented at the meeting -- a report by RobertIngria on the experience of using the output of a l inguistic knowledgeacquisition system (the Learner) that was intended for one NL system (the BBNParlance interface, which is ATN based) in another NL system, one which usesa completely different underlying theory (the BBN ACFG system, which has aunification grammar).
In an experiment acquiring a domain-specif ic lexiconof nearly 1500 items, 98% of those lexical items were directly usable by ACFGafter being acquired by the Learner; only 2% required hand editing.217
