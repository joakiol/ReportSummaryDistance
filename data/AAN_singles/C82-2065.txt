LESK: A LANGUAGE SYNT~TIZING NATURAL LANGUAGE, COMPUTERLANGUAGE AND LOGICDouglas SkuceDept.
of Computer Sc ience ,  Un ivers i ty  of  Ottawa, Ottawa,Ontar io ,  CanadaIn t roduct ionLESK (Language fo r  Exact ly  3 ta t l~  Knowledge) i s  in tend-ed to br idge the cons iderab le  gap between natura l  language(I~L), computer lan6uage (CL) and log~tc.
I t  i s  des i rab le  to  doso fo r  the fo l low ing  reason .
To implement any non- t r iv ia lcomputer system for  some problem domain, one must f i r s t  havea very  c lear  unders tand ing  of  the  domain concepts .
Usua l ly  theimplementors do not  have th i s  knowledge, and must s t rugg le  toobta in  i t  from the domain exper ts ,  who are usua l ly  not comput-e r  exper ts .
Hence a means of  p rec i se  and e f f i c ient  knowledgeexpress ion  would be very  use fu l .
No such too l  ex i s ts  todayand we there fore  seek to  deve lop  one.
LESK i s  a f i r s t  approx-imat ion  to such a medium for  knowledge capture .Anyone who has par t i c ipated  in  the des ign  of  any systemwhere knowledge t rans fer  from exper ts  was invo lved  w i l l  appre -~clare the need for such a tool.
The existlng tools are thefollowing: ~L, mathematical concepts and notation, computerconcepts and notation, plus assorted devices llke dls4~ams,plctures, models, etc.
By far the major tool is NL however,which i s  unfortunately very poorly used by most paople, part-icularly recent university @~aduates.
The most frequent ezTorsinclude the use of undefined termlnolo@~, synonyms or homon~ns(whose status as such must be guessed), unclear syntax, logical- 262 -er rors  (such as out r ight  cont rad ic t ions ) ,  undef ined re la t ionsbetween concepts ,  and s?mp~e lack  of  good organ izat ion?
LESKfo rces  the user  to  express  h im/herse l f  izi ways des igned tominimize such er rors .
A T RSK system (an in teract ive  programwh?ch "unders tands"  LESK) would fu r ther  reduce such er rorsoCr i te r ia  fo r  LESKLESK shoulda) be readab le  by most un ivers i ty  graduates  in  sc ience ,medic ine ,  law or  bus iness ,  fo r  ezmnple|b) be wr i tab le  by most people w i th  a bas ic  knowledge of  se ttheory ,  log ic  end computers ' ;o) have a s imple semant ics  express ib le  in  f i r s t -o rder  log ic~d) be lmplementable us ing ar t i f i c ia l  in te l l igence  techn iques!e) be su f f i c ient ly  genera l  to  be usab le  in  the sub jec ts  ofin teres t  to  those  l i s ted  in  a ) .The present  des ign  of  LESK has been shown to meet a l l  o fthese  cr i te r ia .~asi~n of ~sKLESK should be viewed as a language fo r  making asser t -ions about sets ,  tup les ,  sequences, funct ions ,  re la t ions ,procedures and other  s~nple mathematical concepts us ing anEns l i sh - l i ke  syntax  (many o ther  NLs could be used!
t rans la t -i on  of  LESK-based knowledge should be eas ie r  than t rans la t iono f  NL).
The user  dec la res  words or  phrases e i ther  exp l i c i t l yor  ~np l io i t l y  to  be nouns (or  noun- l i ke ) ,  ad jec t ives ,  p re -pos i t ions ,  or verbs  (o ther  categor ies  have not been necess -a ry ) .
Nouns and noun phrases denote sets ,  s ta t ive  verbs  de-note  re la t ions ,  ac t ion  verbs  denote procedures ,  and prepos i t -ions  denote case re la t ions .
The syntax  i s  a compromise bet -ween b-L, CT, and logo .
