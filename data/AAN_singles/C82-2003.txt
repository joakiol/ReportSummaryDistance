The concepts andconst ruct ions  of LICOL presuppose a rather  broad range ofusers  - from nonpro fess iona l  ones ( t rans la tors ,  lsy~co~p~aph -e re ,  ed i to rs ,  e tc . )

LIOOL can be used as a command l a~,u~e i n- 17  -i n fo rmat ion  re t r ieva l ,  as a data descr ip t ion  and data  manipu l -a t ion  language in  data  base des ign  and as a programming lan6ua-ge in  the usua l  sense .
I t  i s  in tended as means fo r  de f in ingand cont ro l  both in  d ia log ica l  ( 'on - l ine)  and in  batch  (o f f -- l i ne )  p rocess ing .As a semiot i c  system LICOL cons is ts  of  s igns  - b i la te ra lent i t ies  - composed by s ig~l f iants  (sequences  o f  le t te rs )  ands ign i f i6s  - those  ent i t ies  o f  rea l  or  conceptua l  wor ld whichare  ob jec ts  and/or  means fo r  automat ic  p rocess ing .
The ro le  ofs ign l f i6s  in  th i s  language can be p layed by the s ig~.
i f i antsand by the s igns  of the same language.
This "wor ld  o f  lan~a6e"we name the system of i t s  concepts  the  re la t ions  of  which areexpress ib le  in  terms of  re la t ions  between the  s igns  of  thelanguage.
To use LICOL, spec i f i ca lXy  to  program in  th i s  lan6ua-ge,  i s  to  express  one 's  thou~ht ,  knowledge, not ions  in  theframework of  the "wor ld  o f  LICOL" in  accordance w i th  the ru lesof  i t s  grammar (syntax) .
In  th i s  language the  funct ion-ar~nnn-ant form i s  chosen as means fo r  ~ s ta t in~ re la t ions  between theconcepts :  su f f i xa l  compound stems and pre f ixa l  and /or  su f f i xa lincorporated  synta6m8 , the  par t  o f  the su f f i xes  be in  6 p layedby names of  operat ions .
The notat ion  of  LICOL there fore  hasthe  re tersed  Po l i sh  form.S ince LICOL i s  a language fo r  computat ion,  the mainconcept of  i t s  "wor ld"  ( i .e .
the main s ign  o f  i t s  semiot i csystem) is the notion of Computational Construction (CC).The CCs are constructional material both for the prO~TSme andthe  data ,  the  under ly ing  form fo r  which are  IC t rees .
S incethe  t rees  are  eas i l y  representab le  in  a l inear  form by meansof  the Po l i sh  form of notat ion ,  i t  i s  natura l  to  in terpretp ro te ins  as data  and v ice  versa ,  the data  be ing f rac tured  in tore la t iona l ly -h ie rarch ica l  data  network.
This  a l lows  to  cons iderthe data  base a l so  as a data  base fo r  p rocedura l ly  representedknowledge and there fore  not to  draw d is t inc t ions  between thetwo main forms of data  representat ion  - a naming and a proce-dura l  one.- 18  -Aocoz.11ng to the type of signlfla,~ts the COs axe dlvld-ed into rep:esentln8 and processing co-structions, each ofwhich are fu r ther  subdiv ided:  the represent ing  c lass  in tonames and p ic tures  and the process ing  c lass  in to  cont ro l le rsand operat ions .
I f  the s i~Lf iant  i s ,  semiot tca l ly ,  a symbol,we have to do with a namin~ const ruct ion ,  i f  i t  i s  an i con ,we have a p ic ture  const ruct ion!

The s ign -i f i6e  for' the CCs are the so -ca l led  descr ip t ions  cons is t ingof 'a descr ip tor  (which corresponds to the concept of thes ign)  and of i t s  re fe rent  (va lue) .According to the  type of s ign i f i#s  the CCe are d iv idedin to  rea l ,  v i r tua l  and notat iona l  const ruct ions .

They are s t ruc tured  in to  e lements ,  cha ins ,  f ie lds ,  re -cords,  f ragments ,  se ts  and bases .
The v i r tua l  OCs correspondto the user ' s  not ions  of p rocess ing  and are s t ruc tured  in toatoms, sequences,  t rees ,  ~un6hes (a rb i t ra ry  graphs) ,  b locks ,f i l es  and ( f i l e )  systems.
The not iona l  CCe correspond to con-e t i tu t ive  par ts  of ent i t les  of s i~mtf iante .
These are:  le t t -e rs ,  s t r ings ,  groups (of  s t r ings ) ,  segments,  modules,  corpusand packets (of  texts ) .Acco~ding to the form of va lue  the CCs can be subd iv id -ed in to  sca la rs ,  vectors  and l i s t s .
The sca la r  CCs have thefo l low ing  typess numbers, codes, log ica ls ,  f igures ,  symbols,keys,  re fe rences ,  descr ip tors  and masks.
The not ion  of thevector  corresponds to one of a r ray ,  i t s  components may be noton ly  sca la rs  but a l so  vectors  or l i s t s ,  provided the i r  com-ponents are of the same type.
The l i s t s  may cons is t  of sea l -e rs ,  vectors  or sub l i s te  which may be of route ,  t ree ,  s t ruc t -ure or  execut ive  type.Such mul t ibase  c lass i f i ca t ion  of  the CCs has the fo l low-ing  sense .
The operat ions  of LICOL are def ined  on the v iz ' tua lCCs having ve.z"J.Ous or ig ins -  e i ther  netat iona l  ( textua l )- 19  -const i tuents  or denotat iona l ,  v i r tua l  and rea l  CCs.

Two or  more CCs can be assoc ia tedtogether  one o f  them being an ob jec t  and the res t  of i t sfeatures .
