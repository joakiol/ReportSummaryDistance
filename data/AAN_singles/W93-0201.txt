A number of researchers have a, rgm~d lbr the use of rhetorica,l\[(~ri75\] or coherence relations\[I-Iol)79\], and the rhetorical relations pecified by R S'I?
\[MT87\] have I)e(,~, used in structuring text\[tlov88, MP90\].
In this l)a.l)el" , we exa.mine rh(q.ori(:al relations in the cold.~,xt of dia.logue, ra, tlmrthan single-speaker te?t.
We argue that rea,s(millg about relational )r()lmsit, ions is necessary butnot sufficient ior structuring (lialogtm, 1)oiHt out s(,v(q'al prol)h,ms of a, pplyiug RST to dialogue, a, ndargue tbr the necessity of recognizillg the intentions underlying utteratlces a,lld I, he rich relationshil)samong these intentions.Our research on recognizing expressions of (hml)t and interpreting ilMirect replies providesevidence that what Moore a,nd Polla,ck call i lfformal,itmal level rela, ti(ms \[Ml'!

"(3) SI: "Isu't Dr. Smith on sabbatical:e"(4) $2: "No, hc 's not on .s,bbalical.
"If $1 responds with "Wasn't  Dr. Smith aw,trdcd a ~;albright?
', then since it is plausilfle that.Dr.
Smith having a Full)right would result ill his going on sa,l)l)a, tical, Sl 's utterance should Iminterpreted as exl)ressing doubt at the l)rOlmsition that Dr. Smith is ii(:)l, (m sabbatical.
Similarly,if heing a systems person is necessa.ry for teaclfillg C,$360 and Sl reslmll(Is with "Lsn't Dr. Smith atheory person?
",  then since Dr. Smith being a, theory person in an alterna, l, ive t,o Dr. Smith being a.systems person, Sl 's utterance shonhl be interpreted as exl)ressing (h)ul)t at the l>roposition that l)r.Smith is teaching CS360.
But if SI had instead asked "l.~u't C'$240 a prcrcq'ui.~itc for CS360~' ,  Sl'sutterance should be interpreted as seekillg new itlforma.tion since there is ,,o pla.usibh~ intbrmationalrelation suggesting that the new utterance contril)utes to (leteu'mitfiug wht,tlmr Dr. Smith is ~)ntsabbatical or to identifying the instructor of (',S3(i0.
Thus, identilying the illformational relationshipbetween utterances is essential for responding apl~rt>l)ria,tely.
\[LC,92\] I~rovi(tes a,n algorithm tha.tutilizes such relations in recognizing expressions of doul)t.Our research on interpreti~g iudirect rel)lies \[GC'92\] l)rovid~'s a.
(hlitio,~al evidence that in-h)rmational relations play an iml)ortant role in discourse iutel'l)r(,ta.tio~.
(',onsider the tbllowingdia.|ogue sequence:(5) SI: "Did Harry scc his girlJ)'icnd last u,~.t'kcm, dW'(6) S2: "He: h:ft for New York on Friday.
"We have shown \[GC92\] that S1 and S2's shaxed a.ssumptiol~ tha.t S2's iutlirect answer in (5) iscoherelDtly related to sonte possible dir(~ct a.usw~r is uecessary 1.o (,n;ibl(~ S1 I.o identify S2's intended(but implicit) answer of "Yes" or "No".
l;k~r example, SUl~pt)se Sl I)(dieves tha.t it is mutually be-lieved that Harry and his girlfriend I)oth live iu Deliver.
Then, S1 w(mld interl)ret ((i) as describinga.n alternative to Ha,rry seeing his girlfriend a.,M thus would iul'(~r a. n(,ga.l.iv(' a.nsw(~r to (5).
()nthe other hand, SUl)l)ose SI believes tha.t it is mutually believe(I that l\[arry lives in Denver but hisgirlfriend lives in New York.
Then, $1 would iuterpret ((i) as (lescril)ing a.u action enabling Harryto see his girlfriend and thus would iufer a l)ositive answer.
In ol.\]mr words, Sl 's recognition ofthe relational )roposition which $2 intended to convey is nec(,ssa.ry lk)r iuterl)reting S2's intendedanswer.
If $1 failed to recognize such a rela.tion, then SI would I)e unable to answer a questionsuch a.s "Why didu't Ilarry st:t: his girlfriend la.~t 'weekend?"
Thus in our mod(-d \[GC92\], the al)pli-cability conditions of discourse plan operators tbr a.nswering a Yes/No question include conditionsrequiring that COml)onents of the response (whether iml)licit or explicit) be related by coherencerelations imilar to informational-level rhetorical relations.
Since the sa.me set of operators is usedin generating answers, inforlnational relations also play a role in ensuring that an indirect answeris approl)riate.
In other woMs, the intbrmationa.1 relations coustrain wha.t ::xtlu iuibrmation (infor-mation not specifically requested by the questioner) may be included in au a.l)prol)riate resl)onse.Alk indirect answer is genera.ted by use of the ~'xlra iM'ormati(m ~l.h)lJ~.In our view, this extr;~ intbrmation m;~.y serve a rhetori('a.I t'u ncl.iol, such as to increase belief.For example, $2 might have decided to include the extra iuforma.tion in ((i) (tha,t I-larry left forNew York on Frida.y) in his negative a.nswer because $2 anticipate(I tha.t SI would have doubteda simple "No".
In our current research, we a.re defining stimulus (:(:mditioJls for use of the extraiJfformation in an answer.
A stimulus condition describes a situa.ti(m i,~ which it may 1)e beneficialto inch,de iMbrmation that was neither requested m)r wha.t tim Sl)(,ak(~r Ii~.

Thus, stimulus Coliditions are used to s(,lect ~.u a,I)l)r~)t)ria.t(' i ,l~)rlual.ioua.I r(,l;J.tion.\]Iowever, we contend that rhetorical r(~la.ti()ns, eslwcia.lly a.s d(,liu(,(I I)y RST, axe insul\[icienttbr characterizing dialogue.

"Although one might argue that there is a Motiwl.te-Volitiona.l-Actiou rela.tion between John cuttingclass ill (9) and John going home in (8), the fimction of uttera,nce (9) is to attack the evidencerelationship between utterances (8) and (7), which RST cannot account for since RST capturesrela.tions between spans of text whereas (9) is rel'uting the ilnpli('it l)rol)(,sitiou between (7)-(8), notthe text itself.In addition, rhetorical relatious as (lelivwd iu IT ST rela.te s:ll.ellites l.(~ a mtcl(~us, which to-gether form an uninterrul)ted text spa.\]~, l\[()w(,v(,r, lit dia.logu(~, ;~.,~ ill.l.Ol';i.iic(, III;I.y rel~.t(~ to an earli~r2utterance U yet be separated fl'om U by other utterances that do m)t relat(, to U.

"SI and $2 each declare a claim in utteran(:es (10) and (11).
Although (:)n(~ can argue that analternative relation holds between utterances (12) a.nd (13) and between utterances (14) and (15),the structure of the dialogue is not c.oml)letely cal)tured by rela.l.ilkg l:hese consecutive pa.irs ofutterances.
Utterances (12) and (14) SUl)l,ort Sl's claim in (\]0), and tltl;es'aslces (13) alld (\]5)support S2's clMm in (11).
Although one might suggest (lrol)ping the requirement tha.t rhetorica.lrelations relate a span of utterances, it is unclear how rhetorica,l rela.tions Mone couhl handlecomplex dialogues.
We believe that in i(lentit:ving the structure o\[" dialogues uch as the ab(we,expectations about the discourse goals of the particil)ants must be taken into a.ccount (in this case,a speaker supporting his/her own claim and indi'mctly attacking tha.t of the other) and a moreelaborate intentional structure allowed.Furthermore, uttera.nces ca.n silmfltaneously serve more than ot,e function, which wouldrequire two distinct RST a.na.lyses.

"(19) ",.5'0 I am very .~orry, b'ul I must dcelim: your in'vitali,m.
"Utterance (16) conveys both a. litera.l question alLd an invita.tion.
Two RST a.nalyses ;i.re requiredfor S2's response, one relating (17) and (18) to the literal questiols aml the other rela.ting (19) to theinvitation.
However, RST requires a single a.mdysis a.nd a hierarchical structure.
In addition, RSTcannot account for the fact that if (19) is omitted from S2's response, it m:l.y still be imp\]ica:l.ed.P~ecognizing intentions is essential tot dialogue ullderstan(ling, since these intentions pro-vide expectations used in interpreting subsequent utterances and identif~qng the structure of thedialogue.
For example, we show in \[GC92\] that expectations about discourse goals pla.y a role inthe interpretation of indirect replies to Yes/No questions.
After Sl's request for informa.tion inthe exchange (5) - (6), $1 and $2 sha,re the exlmctation that S2's response will convey the re-quested information.
This expectation is used to focus on a. certain set of discourse plan ol)eratorsrepresenting mutuMly accessil)le knowledge of standard forms tbr giving a. positive or negative an-swer.
Furtherlnore, our dialogue model \[LC91\] captures not only communicative intentions l)ut a.lsodolnMn and prol)lem-solving intentions, a.ud these intentions result it, a. set.
of expectations tlmtfacilitate understanding subse(lueld; uttera.ttcos and genera.tillg a.1)l~rol~ria.t(, responses.
In \[C, hug:~\],we explore response generation in (olla.l)ora.tiv(, (li;dogue.Although current resea.rch as been com'er,md with recognizillg tit(, i|lloJd.ions tlsa.t a. spea.k(,ris trying to convey, we 1)elieve th;~.t an effective aim intelligent sysl,em must do l|lore.
If a sysl,(,mis to handle naturally occurring (lia.l(~gue, which can  ra.nge from COmlfletely COOl~er;dfive to non-COOl)erative in a single interaction, then the system must be ~l.l~le I.o recognize hidden intentions,such as the intention to lie or deceive.
Although recognition of such hid(le\]!
intentions may not beessential for identifying the structure of the (lisco!
!rse, it is necessary for the system's responses tobe intelligent, natural, and effective.So what makes a dialogue coherent?
We believe that dialogue coherence depends upon bothinformational nd intentional level properties of the dialogue.
We contend that a natural anguagedialogue system must be able to recognize a, speaker's intentions, tha.t this recognition of intentionis often aided by identification of intbrmational level relational 1)rol)ositions, and thaJ; in many cases;L speaker intends for these informationaJ level rela.tions to be recognized (as in the exchange giw~nin (5) - (6)).
Our research as led us to conclude that rhetorical rela.tions as specified by RSTare necessary but not sufficient for ha.ndling dialogues - -  the rich relationshiI)s among discourseintentions must also he captured.References\[(',hu93\]\[Gc921\[1Iol)79\]\[tlov88\]\[LC91\]Jennii~er Chu.
