REPRESENTING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT KNOWLEDGE AND MUTUAL KNOWLEDGESald SoulhiEquipe de Comprehension du Raisonnement NaturelLSI - UPSllg route de Narbonne 31062 Toulouse - FRANCEABSTRACTIn order to represent speech acts, in amulti-agent context, we choose a knowledgerepresentation based on the modal logic ofknowledge KT4 which is defined by Sato.
Sucha formalism allows us to reason about know-ledge and represent knowledge about knowled-ge, the notions of truth value and of defi-nite reference.I INTRODUCTIONSpeech act representation and the lan-guage planning require that the system canreason about intensional concepts like know-ledge and belief.
A problem resolver mustunderstand the concept of knowledge and knowfor example what knowledge it needs to achie-ve specific goals.
Our assumption is that atheory of language is part of a theory of ac-tion (Austin \[4\] ).Reasoning about knowledge encounters theproblem of intensionality.
One aspect of thisproblem is the indirect reference introducedby Frege ~\]  during the last century.
Mc Car-thy \[15\] presents this problem by giving thefollowing example :Let the two phrases : Pat knows Mike's tele-phone number (I)and Pat dialled Mike's te-lephone number (2)The meaning of the proposition "Mike's tele-phone number" in (I) is the concept of thetelephone number, whereas its meaning in (2)is the number itself.Then if we have : "Mary's telephone number= Mike's telephone number",we can deduce that :"Pat dialled Mary's tele-phone number"but we cannot deduce that :"Pat knows Mary's telephonenumber",because Pat may not have known the equalitymentioned above.Thus there are verbs like "to know", "tobelieve" and "to want" that create an "opaque"context.
For Frege a sentence is a name, refe-rence of a sentence is its truth value,the sense of a sentence is the proposi-tion.
In an oblique context, the refe-rence becomes the proposition.
For exam-ple the referent of the sentence p in theindirect context "A knows that p" is aproposition and no longer a truth value.Me Carthy \[15\] and Konolige \[I I\]have adopted Frege's approach.
They consi-der the concepts like objects of a first-order language.
Thus one term will denoteMike's telephone number and another willdenote the concept of Mike's telephonenumber.
The problem of replacing equalitiesby equalities is then avoided because theconcept of Mike's telephone number and thenumber itself are different entities.Mc Carthy's distinction concept/objectcorresponds to Frege's sense/reference orto modern logicians' intension/extension.Maida and Shapiro \[13\] adopt the sameapproach but use propositional semanticnetworks that are labelled graphs, and thatonly represent intenslons and not exten-sions, that is to say individual conceptsand propositions and not referents andtruth values.
We bear in mind that a seman-tic network is a graph whose nodes repre-sent individuals and whose oriented arcsrepresent binary relations.Cohen E6\], being interested in speechact planning, proposes the formalism ofpartitioned semantic networks as data baseto represent an agent's beliefs.
A parti-tioned semantic network is a labelled graphwhose nodes and arcs are distributed intospaces.
Every node or space is identifiedby its own label.
Hendrix ~9\] introducedit to represent the situations requiringthe delimitation of information sub-sets.In this way Cohen succeeds in avoiding theproblems raised by the data base approach.These problems are clearly identified byMoore FI7,18\].
For example to represent'A does-not believe P', Cohen assertsBelieve (A,P) in a global data base, en-tirely separated from any agent's know-ledge base.
But as Appelt ~\]  notes, thissolution raised problems when one needs tocombine facts from a particular data base194with global facts to prove a single assertion.For example, from the assertion :know (John,Q) & know (John,P ~Q)where P~ Q is in John's data base and ~ know(John,Q) is in the global data base, it shouldbe possible to conclude % know (John,P) buta good strategy must be found !In a nutshell, in this first approachwhich we will call a syntactical one, an a-gent's beliefs are identified with formulasin a first-order language, and propositionalattitudes are modelled as relations betweenan agent and a formula in the object langua-ge, but Montague showed that modalities can-not consistently be treated as predicates ap-plying to nouns of propositions.The other approach no longer considersthe intenslon as an object but as a functionfrom possible worlds to entities.
For ins-tance the intension of a predicate P is thefunction which to each possible world W (ormore generally a point of reference, seeScott \[23\] ) associates the extension of Pin W.This approach is the one that MooreD7,18\] adopted.
He gave a first-order axio-matization of Kripke's possible worlds seman-tics \[12\] for Hintikka's modal logic of know-ledge \[,0\].The fundamental assumption that makesthis translation possible, is that an attri-bution of any propositional attitude like"to know", "to believe", "to remember", "tostrive" entails a division of the set of pos-sible worlds into two classes : the possibleworlds that go with the propositional attitu-de that is considered, and those that are in-compatible with it.
Thus "A knows that P" isequivalent to "P is true in every world com-patible with what A knows".We think that possible worlds languageis complicated and unintuitive, since, ratherthan reasoning directly about facts that some-one knows, we reason about the possible worldscompatible with what he knows.
This transla-tion also presents some problems for the plan-ning.
For instance to establish that A knowsthat P, we must make P true in every worldwhich is compatible with A's knowledge.
Thisset of worlds is a potentially infinite set.The most important advantage ofMoore's approach \[17,183 is that it givesa smart axiomatization of the interactionbetween knowledge and action.II PRESENTATION OF OUR APPROACHOur approach is comprised in the generalframework of the second approach, but in-stead of encoding Hintikka's modal logicof knowledge in a first-order language,we consider the logic of knowledge propo-sed by Mc Carthy, the decidability ofwhich was proved by Sato \[21\] and we pro-pose a prover of this logic, based on na-tural deduction.We bear in mind that the idea of u-sing the modal logic of knowledge in A.I.was proposed for the first time by Mc Car-thy and Hayes \[14\].A.
LanguagesA language L is a triple (Pr,Sp,T)where :.Pr is the set of propositional va-riables,.Sp is the set of persons,.T is the set of positive integers.The language of classical proposi-tional calculus is L = (Pr,6,~).
SoCSpwill also be denoted by 0 and will becalled "FOOL".B.
Well Formed FormulasThe set of well formed formulas isdefined to be the least set Wff such as :(W|) P rC  Wff(W 2) a,b-~ Wff implies aD b eWf f(W 3) S6_Sp,t 6.T,aeWff implles(St)a~_WffThe symbol D denotes "implication".
(St)a means "S knows a at time t"<St>a (= % (St) ~ a) means "a is pos-sible for S attime t".
{St}a (= (St)a V (St) % a) means"S knows whethera at time t".195C.
Hilbert-type System KT4The axiom schemata for KT4 are :At.
Axioms of ordinary propositional lo-gicA2.
(St)a ?
aA3.
(Ot)a ~ (Or) (St)aA4.
(St) (a D b) ~ ((Su)a D(Su)b), wheret 6 uA5.
(St)a ~ (St) (St)aA6.
If a is an axiom, then (St)a is anaxiom.Now, we give the meaning of axioms :(A2) says that what is known is true, thatis to say that it is impossible to havefalse knowledge.
If P is false, we cannotsay : "John knows that P" but we can say"John believes that P".
This axiom is themain difference between knowledge and be-lief.This distinction is important for plan-ning because when an agent achieves his goals,the beliefs on which he bases his actions mustgenerally be true.
(A3) says that what FOOL knows at time t,FOOL knows at time t that anyone knowsit at time t. FOOL's knowledge representsuniversal knowledge, that is to say allagents knowledge.
(A4) says that what is known will remaintrue and that every agent can apply modusponens, that is, he knows all the logicalconsequences of his knowledge.
(A5) says that if someone knows somethingthen he knows that he knows it.
This a-xiom is often required to reason aboutplans composed of several steps.
It willbe referred to as the positive introspec-tive axiom.
(A6) is the rule of inference.D.
Representation of the notion of truth va-lue.We give a great importance to the repre-sentation of the notion of truth value of aproposition, for example the utterance :John knows whether he is taller thanBill (I)can be considered as an assertion that mentionsthe truth value of the proposition P = John istaller than Bill, without taking a position asto whether the latter is true or false.In our formalism (I) is representedby :{John} PThis disjunctive solution is also adoptedby Allen and Perrault D\ ]"  Maida and Sha-piro \[13\] represent this notion by a nodebecause the truth value is a concept (anobject of thought).The representation of the notion oftruth value is useful to plan questions :A speaker can ask a hearer whether a cer-tain proposition is true, if the latterknows whether this proposition is true.E.
Representing definite descriptions inconversational systems :Let us consider a dialogue betweentwo participants : A speaker S and a hea-rer H. The language is then reduced to :Sp = (O,H,S} and T = {l}Let P stand for the proposition : "Thedescription D in the context C is unique-ly satisfied by E".Clark and Marshall \[5\] give examples thatshow that for S to refer to H to some en-tity E using some description D in a con-text C, it is sufficient that P is a mu-tual knowledge; this condition is tanta-mount to (O)P is provable.
Perrault andCohen \[20\] show that this condition istoo strong.
They claim that an infinitenumber of conjuncts are necessary for suc-cessful reference :(S) P& (S)(H) e& (S)(H)(S) e & ...with only a finite number of false conjuncts.Finally, Nadathur and Joshi ~9\]  give thefollowing expression as sufficient conditionfor using D to refer to E :(S) BD (S)(H) P & ~ ((S) BO(S)~(O)P)where B is the conjunction of the set ofsentences that form the core knowledge ofS and ~ is the inference symbole.III SCHOTTE - TYPE SYSTEM KT4'Gentzen's goal was to build a forma-lism reflecting most of the logical rea-sonings that are really used in mathemati-196cal proofs?
He is the inventor of natural de-duction (for classical and intultionistic lo-gics).
Sato ~|\]  defines Gentzen - type sys-men GT4 which is equivalent to KT4.
We consi-der here, schStte-type system KT4' \[22\] whichis a generalization of S4 and equivalent toGT4 (and thus to KT4), in order to avoid thethinning rule of the system GT4 (which intro-duces a cumbersome combinatory).
Firstly, weare going to give some difinitions to intro-duce KT4'.A.
Inductive definition of positive and ne-gative parts of a formula FLogical symbols are ~ and V.a.
F is a positive part of F.b.
If % A is a positive part of F, thenA is a negative part of F.c.
If ~ A is a negative part of F, thenA is a positive part of F.d.
If A V B is a positive part of F,then A and B are positive parts of F.Positive parts or negative parts which do notcontain any other positive parts or negativeparts are called minimal parts.B.
Semantic propertyThe truth of a positive part implies thetruth of the formula which contains this posi-tive part.The falsehood of a negative part impliesthe truth of the formula which contains thisnegative part.C.
NotationF\[A+\] is a formula which contains A as apositive partF\[A-\] is a formula which contains A as anegative part.F\[A+,B-\] is a formula which contains A asa positive part and B as a negativepart where A and B are disjoined (i.e, o~e is not a subformula of the o-ther).D.
Inductive definition of F \[.jFrom a formula F \[A\], we build anotherformula or the empty formula F \[.\] by dele-ting A :a.
If F \[A 3 ?
A, then F\[.\] is the emptyformula.c.
If F G\[A V BJ or = G V AJthen .
= G \[BJ.E.
AxiomAn axiom is any formula of the formF\[P+,P-\] where P is a propositional varia-ble.F.
Inference rules(R!)

Cut-elimlnation theorem (Hauptsatz)Any KT4' proof-figure can be trans-formed into a KT4' proof-figure with thesame conclusion and without any cut as arule of inference (hence, the rule (R4)is superfluous.
The proof of this theo-rem is an extension of Sch~tte's one for$4'.
This theorem allows derivations"without detour"?IV DECISION PROCEDUREA logical axiom is a formula of theform F\[P+,P-\].
A proof is an single-roo-ted tree of formulas all of whose leavesare logical axioms.
It is grown upwardsfrom the root, the rules (RI), (R2) and(R3) must be applied in a reverse sense.These reversal rules will be used as"production rules"?
The meaning of eachproduction expressed in terms of the pro-granting language PROLOG is an implication?It can be shown \[24J that the followingstrategy is a complete proof procedure :?
The formula to prove is at the star-197ring node;?
Queue the minimal parts in the given for-mula;?
Grow the tree by using the rule (R|) inpriority , followed by the rule (R2), thenby the rule (R3).The choice of the rule to apply can bedone intelligently.
In general, the choice of(RI) then (R2) increases the likelihood tofind a proof because these (reversal) rulesgive more complex formulas.
In the case where(R3) does not lead to a loss of formulas, itis more efficient to choose it at first?
Thefollowing example is given to illustrate thisstrategy :ExampleTake (A4) as an example and let Fo deno-tes its equivalent version in our language(Fo is at the start node) :Fo = ~(St ) (~a V b) V ~(Su)a V (Su)b wheret < uP~ denotes positive parts and P?
