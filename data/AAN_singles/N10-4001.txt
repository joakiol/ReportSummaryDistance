Proceedings of the NAACL HLT 2010: Tutorial Abstracts, pages 1?2,Los Angeles, California, June 2010. c?2010 Association for Computational LinguisticsData-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduceJimmy Lin and Chris DyerUniversity of Maryland, College Park{jimmylin,redpony}@umd.edu1.
OverviewThis half-day tutorial introduces participants to data-intensive textprocessing with the MapReduce programming model [1], using theopen-source Hadoop implementation.
The focus will be on scalabilityand the tradeoffs associated with distributed processing of largedatasets.
Content will include general discussions about algorithmdesign, presentation of illustrative algorithms, case studies in HLTapplications, as well as practical advice in writing Hadoop programsand running Hadoop clusters.2.
Intended AudienceThe tutorial is targeted at any NLP researcher who is interested indata-intensive processing and scalability issues in general.
Nobackground in parallel or distributed computing is necessary, but aprior knowledge of HLT is assumed.3.
Course Objectives* Acquire understanding of the MapReduce programming model and how itrelates to alternative approaches to concurrent programming.
* Acquire understanding of how data-intensive HLT problems (e.g., textretrieval, iterative optimization problems, and graph algorithms)can be solved using MapReduce.
* Acquire understanding of the tradeoffs involved in designingMapReduce algorithms and awareness of associated engineering issues.4.
Tutorial TopicsThe following represents a tentative list of topics that will be covered:* Introduction to parallel and distributed processing* Introduction to MapReduce* Tradeoffs and issues in algorithm design* Simple counting applications (e.g., relative frequency estimation)* Applications to inverted indexing and text retrieval* Applications to graph algorithms1* Applications to iterative optimization algorithms (e.g., EM)* Case study in machine translation* Tips and tricks in writing Hadoop programs* Practical issues in running Hadoop clusters5.
Instructor BiosJimmy Lin is an Associate Professor in the iSchool at the Universityof Maryland, College Park.
He joined the faculty in 2004 aftercompleting his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science atMIT.
Dr Lin's research interests lie at the intersection of naturallanguage processing and information retrieval.
He leads the Universityof Maryland's effort in the Google/IBM Academic Cloud ComputingInitiative.
Dr. Lin has taught two semester-long Hadoop courses andhas given numerous talks and tutorials about MapReduce to a wideaudience.Chris Dyer is a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, CollegePark, in the Department of Linguistics.
His current researchinterests include statistical machine translation, machine learning,and the relationship between artificial language processing systemsand the human linguistic processing system.
He has served on programcommittees for AMTA, ACL, COLING, EACL, EMNLP, NAACL, ISWLT, and theACL Workshops on Machine translation, and is one of the developers ofthe Moses open source machine translation toolkit.
He has practicalexperience solving NLP problems with both the Hadoop MapReduceframework and Google's MapReduce implementation, which was madepossible by an internship with Google Research in 2008.References[1] Dean, Jeffrey and Sanjay Ghemawat.
