Our methodology has been applied in theconstruction of a l:rench-Fnglish-Malay dictionary.
Thisdict ionary has been obtained by "crossing".~mi-aulomatically two bilingual dictionaries.

For editing, we useWord and its styling facility, because no editor ofslructured ocument is available on the Macinlosh.
Foriinl~oriing and exporting, we use I/l', a simple specializedlangulige for writing transcriptors, and transfonn betweenrepresentations (normalized ASCII, I{TF, etc.).
Finally,we have developed ALEX, a dictionary tool, io supportthe electronic form.
The methods defined have beenapplied on the FEM dictionary.
They concern Ihecorrection of errors which can :lppears in a manually builldictionary and the formatting o1" this dicliona,y.We inlmduee first in more dot,ills lira situation we facewith the FEM project.
We expose the goals we tend toreach.
Then we gives our generic methods and theirapplications to the specific case of the I:EM dictionary.I.
Situation1.
Presentat ionThe FFM dictionary is composed of two pa,ts: a generalone (12,000 entries) and a specif ic one forcomputer-science tenniuology (2,300 Icnns).
Both paperand elcctmnic forms will be iuodnced by mid-94.We have initially received ASCII files obtained firslly byoplieal characters recognition and corrected manually inwhich the informalions of the French-Faiglish andl{nglish-Malay dictionaries have been crossed.2.
Logical formThe printed form of dictionaries rellect their internalstructure (Boguraev 1990, Byrd, Calzolari, Chodomw &al.
1987).
This slrucinre can lie modelizcd wilh a logical\['el'Ill wh id i  gives the sequence of the informationsconlained by the dictionary.

GoalsWe pursue four goals in th is  project.
They a,c listedIx:low in order of importance.1.
Paper formattingOur first aim is to produce from the ASCII normalizedform a paper form of the FI 'M dictionary with a formatapproaching that of usual dictionaries (fig.

Thisinvolves the introduction in d~e format of fonts, styles, etc.accident lak'ddCW n .m.

3 : an entry of the pul~lishal~le paper FF, M dictionary2.
Electronic formattingWe also produce an electrcmic form.
This electronicdictioua,y is supported by of a generic mullil ingualdictiona,'y tc~l, ALEX.
The problem is to keep as much :isix~ssible of the logical loruL so as to allow logical accesssuch as searching on multiple keys, sorting, etc.3.
Dictionary revision"Crossing" of the French-Euglish and English-Malaydictionaries has been made manually by people who werenot lluent ill French.
Thus, some errors remaiu in both thelogical structure and in the content.
These errors have 1oIx: corrected before producing lhe final paper form of theFEM dictionary.4.
Phonetic codes conversionUSM did not use the standard phonetic transcripticm(international phonetic alphabet - IPA), lint a localtranscription using certain ch'u','lcters of Ihe Tilnes TM font,which looks like characters of the IPA.
These charactershave high ASCII code (128 to 256), thus this rendering isdifferent according to the Ibm.
To be portable to PC forinstauce, the files must contain only lower ASCIIcharacters (32 to 128).I!1.
MethodologyOur methodology is genetic enough to be applied to otherprojects dealing with the construction of real-sizepubl ishable  human-or iented  d ic t ionar ies .
Themethodology is based on the use of simple but powerfull{~ls.1.
Use of an editor for correcting errorsThe problem is to find an appropriale software for thiswork.
The first type of software is databases but ourexperiences with them (we have used dBASE III and all))show that lexicographers don't like to work throughDataBase Management Systems.
They want to use thesame word processor tc~ see the texts they want to indexand to construct the dictionary.The most practical tool would bc an edilor of structureddocuments like Grif (Andr6, Furuta & Quint 1989, Phan& Boiler 1992) which can manage the logical form of tiledictionary, l lowever, such editors are complex Io learnand are not yet availal)le on micros as Ihey require lmgecomputing ressources.
\]Ience, we use Word, a wklelyawlilable com,ncrcial word processor.We approach this notkm of structured ocuments by usingWord's "styling" facility.
A Word style is a group ofparagraph and characters format with a name (e.g.
tile titleof this section has the style ' T i t le l '  which includes tileinformation about the rendering of this lille).
We associatea particul:lr style to each logical type o1" infer,harlem in thedictionary.aeeldent/a ksidCff11 .nl.accidentkelnala n.e, an(kejadian) tidak sengajakejadian) sec/~ra kebetuh!.naccident de train/d'avionIrain/pl ane crashkenl;ihlllga n keretaplrialtos kalml terlmngaeeklenl6/a k'-;i d ~71tt qa.damaged (in an accident)r~sak (d'41am kemalanzan)hurt (in an accklent)tereedera (dalam kemalangan)(terrain)IllleVentidak rata (kawas~,ll|, daerah)hillyberlmkitFig.

3), we propose somesolutions:284the first solution is In use Word's macro facility.Unfortunately, that facility is euly available on thePC version, and we lmmd it very clumsy toconstantly exchange large files bctwcen the PC andthe Macintosh, not speaking of unexpected chantcterW, msfonnafion in tim phonetic fent.the second solution is to use transducers, I)tfl thecommercial Iranscriptors awtilable are only based OILdirect correspondences.
They c:mnot take intoacct')unl a ferw,'u'd context at|d they generally haveno variables (or notion of st:de).
Thus, they arc notp(~werfuI cn(mgh 15r the problems at hired.We used I:l" ( l ;mgtmge of Transcriptions), a Specializedl .anguage for l , inguist ic ProgrammiLlg for wri lt ingtrallscriplors.LT transducers have one input tape with two readingheads (one standard head and one forward head) and onewriting head.
They can also handle wuiables and produceside effects.
Thus, this kind of transeriptors is notreversible in general.There have been p,'evious VCl'sions of I,'1" (l,cpage 1986)The I,T llSed ill our wo!

courier ertimes) to approximate the intcmatielml phonetic alphabet(IPA).
For ex:unple, the ' sign (as in/aksid'/) appcars onlyin a standard macintosh font.We have lhus defined three form.'tts.
Ph:l is the initial fo,mof the Word files in a standard macintosh font (files builtat IJSM).
Ph2 is the format where special characters arereplaced by others which appear in qll usual fonts(characters corresponding with tile letters, the numbersand with the '+', '-' signs, i.e.
7-bits ASCII).
This ASCIIcoding authorises a safe exchange between Macintoshesand P('s.aborigtme:/ab>ri3 )-'n/ --> /ABORIJI :+N/To transcript from the Phl to the Ph2 formats, we use theI,'1" traascriplor pltTl tcoPh2.

The interestingfeatures are tim possibility to index a base on several keysand to search according to these keys or tile content of anynon-indexed entry (although it is slower).Enu'ies can be structured objects and se,'u'chcs an be donein function of the values of the features.

9: an exmnple of the electronic form(terminology entry "attritmt p~ ddfaut")It is possible to pilot ALEX remotely (instead ofinteracting with it via the user-interface) and this nlelhodhas been used to fill the FEM electronic base.To do so, we have written an LT transcriptor wilh strongside effects on ALFX.
The go,d, here, w,'t~ not to producea result in term of a trm~scripted file, but instead to read afile and produce actions on the ALFX b,~se.
As any dialectof LT can mix Lisp commands in their script, it waspossible to make these tools cooperate.ConclusionThe methodology for manipulating human-orienteddictionaries presented in this paper is based on simple batpowerful tools which can be used by lexicographers whodon't want to spend much dine learning how to usestructured doemnents editors and even less, how toprogr,'urt in I)BMS.
We use Word, a commercial wordprocessor; LT, a language of transcriptions; ALF.X, adiction,'uy tool.
Contrary to our initial fears, these simpletools proved very convenient, and powerft, l enough forthe tasks at h,'md.LT and ALFX will soon be av'filable by anonymous ftp atcambridge, apple, com.AcknowledgementsWe ,are grateful to Chuah C.
