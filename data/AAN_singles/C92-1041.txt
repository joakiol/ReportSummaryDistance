GENERATION OF  ACCENT INNOMINALLY  PREMODIF IED NOUN PHRASESRON ZACHARSK1Depart tnent  o f  LinguisticsUnivers i ty  o f  Ed inburghEd inburgh,  UKabstract~Tile primary purpose of this paper is topresent a set of conditions that constrainaccent placement in focused nominallyptemodified NPs.
Selkirk (1984) arguesthat if the premodifier is an argument ofthe head, then the head can be deaccented.I agree with Selkirk's proposal and arguethat what is essential is not whether thepremodifier is a grammatical rgumentof the head noun, but rather, whether it isa 0-complement in lexical conceptualstructure.
This proposal is evaluated bytesting it against a corpus of naturally oc-curring data.O.
in t roduct ionIt is generally agreed that an utterance can be di-vided into two parts which are related to the dis-course function of the information represented bythat utterance.
The TOPIC is what the sentence isabout and the FOCUS represents a new predicationabout the topic.
This information structureconstrains accent placement.
For example,'primary' accent must be within the constituentthat represents the focused information.
Theability of an accent on a single word to mark alarger phrase as focus is widely recognized.
Forexample in (1) the accent on conservative can markthe phrase redneck conservative asthe focused con-stituent (since (1) can be used to answer the ques-tion What was your town like?
).
(Accent is indi-cated by small caps and focus by underlining.
)11 would especially ike to thank Jeanette Gundel andNancy Hedberg for discussions and comments.
(1) My hometown was redneck CObISER-Y_ATI~.
(Lia Matera 1988 Smart Money)in (1) focus is represented by a single constituent,but this need not be the case as (2) illustrates.
(2) A: Where's Karl?B: ~ her ~ .In (2B), Karl, the referent of her, is the topic andtire focus is thus discontinuous.Though there seems to be agreement aboutthe importance of a theory that accounts for the ac-cent-focus relation, there is little agreement aboutthe exact nature of this relationship.
For instance,different theories give different answers to thequestion of whether this relationship is syntactic,semantic, morphological, or pragmatic.
There isalso disagreement over how large a phrase can bebrought into focus by a single accent.Even for simple constructions the relation-ship between accent and focus is unclear.
In exam~pies (3)-(7), a MODIFIER + NOUN constituent isfocused.
Note that in the (a) member of each pair,it is the modifer that receives the accent and inthe (b) member of the pair, it is the head noun.

(Bolinger 1986.118)~'his paper examines the association of accent andfocus in nominally premodified NPs.
21.0 previous work.Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg (1990) state thatsome cases of the relationship between accent andfocus seem dear.
For example, when accent is ondress in the glrl with the red DRESS the focus can beinformation represented by the noun dress, the NPthe red dress, the PP with the red dross, or the entireNP the glrl with the red dress.
Whereas, accentingRED in the same phrase can serve only to focus in-formation represented by the adjective red.However, regarding the relationship between ac-cent and focus in general, they state that q'he ques-tion of how an accent becomes associated with cer-tain material is not yet well understood.'
(p309n.4)Some researchers view this rdationship be-tween focus and accent as essentially syntactic.
Inthe computational literature, Lyons and Hirst(1990) present the following rule constraining theaccent focus relation:(8) a.
What is accented is necessarily in fo-cus.b.
'focus is optionally and nonderermin-istically percolated up the syntax tree,to any node from its rightmost daugh-ter (rightmost because stress manifestsitself only at the end of the focusedconstituent).'
(1990.57)Many theoretical linguists have proposed similarsyntactic constraints relating phrasal accentplacement and focus (see, for example, Chomskyand Halle 1968, Chomsky 1971, Jackendoff 1972,and Culicover and Rochemont 1983).
However, asnoted by these researchers, a rule like the one in(8b) makes incorrect predications for most nomi-nally premodified tips.
For example, consider21 use the more neutral term nominally premodified NPsimtead of mmp~n~.the NP the histor?
teacher in (9B) which has thestructure presented in (10):(9) A: What do you do?B: I'm a HISTORY teacher.
(lO)N wtD N'N" Nhistory teacherClearly the NP a h/nor?
teacher is the focused con-stituent.
3 But by rule (8) the accent on h/nor?
can-not serve to focus the entire NP since hirtor?
is notthe rightmust daughter of this phrase.
4 Thus, aphrasal rule such as (8b) cannot be operative inthese cas~.
Instead, history teacher is viewed as acompound (as a structure of category N 0) andaccent is determined by a separate compoundaccent rule, which places stress on the leftmustelement (see Chomsky and Halle 1968, andSelkirk 1984).Steedman (1991) claims that accent servesto divide an utterance into an optional constituentthat represents the topic (what he, followingJackendoff 1972, calls the 'open-proposition') anda constituent that represents he focus.
He arguesthat within each of these constituents, accent is puton the parr that represents what is 'emphasized orcontrasted' with something in the discourse con-text--the 'interesting part'.
This idea has alsobeen proposed by a number of other researchers(see, for example, Schmerling 1976, Gundel1978, Selkirk 1984, Bolinger 1986, 1989, andRochemont 1986).
Although there is wide dis-agreement about the formal definitions of 'topic-focus' and 'the interesting part' there is no doubtthat these are essential pragmatic determinantsthat constrain accent placement, and it is equally5By focused constituent I mean the phr~,e that representsfocused information.4Rule (7) also fails in a range of other cases including mostintransitive aen~nces ( Whau h~ppenedI--BUSH resigned ).See Schmeding 1976, Gundel 1978, Bolinger 1986, andLambr~ht 1992 for further discmalon.ACRES DE COLING-92, N^h'T~, 23-28 ^OfT 1992 2 5 4 PROC.

23-28, 1992clear that they play a major role determining ac-cent in nominally premodified NPs.
Consider{11), a dialogue between two linguistics professorsabout the dissertation of a student in the depart-ment:(11) A: What's the dissertation about?B: Something to do with languageACQUISITION.
(=Ladd 1980.90 ex.48)Ladd (1980) notes that when linguistics professorsare talking about a dissertation of a student in thedepartment, hey assume that the dissertation isabout some aspect of language and language can bedeaccented.
Ladd continues 'But the linguist'sproud parents, who are not linguists, would telltheir friends, who are also not linguists, that theirson's dissertation was about LANGUAGE acquisi-tion.'
(Ladd 1980.90)It could be argued that the accent patternsin (3)-(5) are also determined by 'interestingness'.However, the role of 'interestingness' i  less clearin phrases like those in (6) and (7).
As Bolinger(1989.200) notes, accent placement in someprenominally modified NPs is more invariablethan in others.
For example, while in (12) the oldinformation constrains the the location of accent,this is not the case in (13) and (14)(12) a.

Why, for example, doesHe was my history TEACHER sound odd as an an-swer to the question How do you know Franz?What was he to you?
Selkirk (1984) suggests aparticularly compelling answer.
She presents thetwo constraints in (15) and (16).
(15) Basic Focm RuleA constituent towhich a pitch accent is as-signed is a focus.
(1984.207)(16) Phrasal Focus RuleA constituent may be in focus if (i) or (ii)(or both) is true:i.
The constituent that is its head is afOg~us.ii.
A constituent contained within itthat is an argument of the head is afOCUS(1984.207)The Basic Focus Rule in (15) is mandatory.
Thisrule states that every word that contains an accentis necessarily focused.
The phrasal focus rule givenin (16) is optional.
The rule (16i) states that if ahead is a focused constituent, then any projectionof that head can optionally be focused.
I f l  say(17) Victoria visits BONEyardsthe N, boneyards, is necessarily a focusedconstituent by rule (15).
Rule (16i) permits focusto percolate to the projections N' and N" asshown in (18):(18) Victoria visits \[N":+focu, \[N':+focu,\ [N :+f~ \[Born'yards\]\]\]Rule (16ii) states that if an argument of a head isfocused, and if that focused constituent is con-tained within the maximal projection of thathead, then the projection of that head can befocused.
For example, if I say(19) Ann danced the taranTELlathe N, tarantella, is necessarily a focusedconstituent.
Since this N is the head of the N", thetarantella, by rule (16i) the tarantella can be afocused contituent.
This N" is an argument of theV, dancea~ and is contained within the maximalAcrES OF.

This leads to correct re-sults since this utterance can be used to respond tothe question What did Ann do at the party?
(She\[V":+focus danced the taranTELla.\])Selkirk's theory of prosody-focus relationpredicts the following accent patterns in focusedmodifier-noun constructions:(20) Selkirk's predictions concerningraoeh'fier-noun pairsARGUMENT head adjtmct HEADARGUMENT HEAD ADJUNCT HEAD*argument HEAD *ADJUNCT headThus, if a noun phrase represents focusedinformation, and if that noun phrase consists of anargument followed by the head noun, then theprediction is that the argument is necessarily ac-cented.
This seems like an elegant way tocharacterize the difference between leftward andrightward accented prenominaUy modified nounphrases, which has been problematic for other ap-proaches to accent placement.
Consider, for ex-ample, the difference in accent pattern between(21) which has an accent on its left constituent, and(22) which has the accent on its right constituent.
(21) HISTORY teacher(22) student TEACHERSelkirk's theory offers a straightforward explana-tion of this difference.
History is an argument ofteacher in (18) and thus by rule (13ii)representation f the entire noun phrase can befocused.
However, in (19) student is an adjunctand accenting the head, teacher, is required tofocus the representation f that noun phrase.
Asimilar notion has been suggested by Rochemont(1986) as shown in (23).
(See Rochemont 1986 fora discussion comparing his focus rules to those ofSelkirk 1984.

If X 0 is \[+focus\] and Ct is an adjunctofX ?
then O~ is \[+focus\].There are three possible relations between aprenominal NP and its head.
The prenominal canbe a grammatical rgument, a complement in lex-ical conceptual structure, or an adjunct modifier.A distinguishing characteristic of an adjunctmodifier is that it is licensed by predication.5 Asa result, it can be separated from its head by acopula.
For example, in the phrase the red car, redis an adjunct modifier and can be separated fromits head as (24) illustrates.
(24) The car is red.In (22) student is a modifier and can be separatedfrom its head as in(25) The teacher is a student.However, in (21) history is not a modifier and itcannot be separated from its head as (24) shows.

?The teacher is of history.There is one question that immediately comes tomind: is Sdkirk's notion of 'argument' a syntacticnotion (that is, is it a grammatical rgument li-censed by A-structure), or is it a semantic notioninvolving 0-participants in lcs?2.
argumentsGrimshaw (1990) argues convincingly that onlynouns that have an internal aspeetual nalysis (nounsthat refer to what she calls complex events) haveargument s ructure (A-structure).
She describes sig-nificant differences in the behavior of complexevent nouns and other nouns to support his analy-sis.
For example, complex event nominals haveobligatory arguments a  shown in (27)(27) a The assignment is to be avoided.b.

The constant assignment of unsolvableproblems is to be avoided.
(Grimshaw 1990.50 ex.8)Grimshaw considers assignment to be ambiguousbetween a complex event interpretation and a pro-cess interpretation.
The addition of the modifierconstant forces the complex event interpretationsince constant can only be construed as a modifierof assignment on the complex event reading.
Thus,it's A-structure must be satisfied as in (27c) just as5That is, the meaning of modifier is predicated on theexternal rgument of the head noun (Its Rargumen0.Aca-~ DE COLING-92, NANTEs, 23-28 ^Ot3T 1992 2 5 6 PROC.

(Grimshaw 1990.50 ex.8)If Grimshaw's analysis is correct, as I believe itis, then the argument referenced in Selkirk'sPhrasal Focus Rule, is best not construed as an ar-gument in A-structure.
For while rule (16) wouldmake correct predictions regarding complex eventnominals uch as those illustrated in (29), it failson nominals that do not represent complex eventsas in (30)(29) a.

BIT guzzler1 believe the distinction is a semantic one involv-ing 0-participants in lexical conceptual structure(Ics).
Every verb and noun (including deverbalnouns) has a lexical conceptual structure that in-cludes the entities involved in the events or statesdescribed (see, for example, Dowty (1989),Fillmore (1968), and Jackendoff (1987, 1990)).Selkirk's intuitions expressed in rules (15) and(16) are essentially correct.
Reformulating herrules as constraints between lexical conceptualstructure and focused information offers a moreprecise characterization f her insights.
A reformu-lation of (15) and (16) constraining the accent-fo-cus relation of premodified NPs containing a de-verbal element is given in (31) and (32):(31) The representation f a constituent isfocused if that constituent receives apitch accent.

However, since these are bothdeverbal nouns, they inherit their O-structure fromthe related verbs.
Package, then, is a 0-comple-ment of delivery, since package is the theme of de-liver, (He delivers packages).
Thus delivery can bedeaccented as in (33a).
Itowever, itt (33b),overnight is not a O-complement of delivery (*tiedelivers overnight) and thus delivery must be ac-cented.
Likewise, in (34a) cetacean is the theme ofresearch (He researches cetaceans) and thus researchcan be deaccented.
However, in (34b) university isnot a 0-complement of research and research mustbe accented.The rules presented in (31) and (32) weretested on data collected from multiple genres ofnatural discourse induding public radio news arti-cles, nruhiple participant discussions, and aca-demic lectures.

relationship DEPENDENCYAt present I have no explanation as to why theseare accented the way they are.
Why, for example,is one problem referred to as DRUG addiction andanother as relationship DEPENDENCY?.However, 1 suggest that woman in (41a) is not acomplement of swimmer.
Woman SWIMMER is anappositional compound (similar to helicopterGUNSHIP).
Appositional compounds are lists ofpropositions, and like all lists, the last element ofthe list typically receives the main accent.
Someevidence to support his view that (41a) is apposi-tional is that the prenominal can be separatedfrom the head by a copula as in (42)(42) The swimmer is a woman.Following Booij and van Haffxen (1988) I bdievethat a semantic effect of -er afFzxation is to bindthe agent or experiencer in lcs.
Thus, the agent roleis not available to the representation f womanand that representation must be linked by 0-iden-tification.
Other examples of this type include(36) and (37a&b).
In cases were the nonhead is theagent of the head the accent pattern varies--some-times the head receives the accent (as (390, (41b),and (41c)) and at other times the nonhead receivesthe accent as in (43).

There is some controversyas to whether such constructions are possible.
Forexample, Selkirk (1982.34) restricts subjectsfrom occurring in these compounds by use of therule presented in (40)(40) The SUBJ argument of a lexical headmay not be satisfied in compoundstructure..Sproat and Liberman (1987) point out that sub-jects in compounds are not usually accented.

7 Sincedeverbal nouns are distinguished from other nounsin the lexicon, the generation system can correctlydetermine when to apply the rule in (32).
AsDowry (1989), Jackendoff (1987, 1990) and oth-ers have noted, lexical conceptual structure isneeded for correct semantic interpretation.
(Forcomputational pproaches see Charniak (1981),Dorr (1989), and Sowa (1991).)
Thus, the rule re-quires only information that has independent mo-tivation for being in the lexicon.As Selkirk noted, the same factors thatgovern accent placement in these constructions alsoconstrain accent in verb phrases and sentences.
Inboth cases the semantic interpretation of a headcan be focused if its 0-complement is focused.6This variation in accent is ~ seen in agents realized uverb.

Thusaccenting potatoes in John twaddles POTATOES canserve to focus the representation (x twaddlespotatoes) and similarly, accenting potato inPOTATO twaddler focuses the representation (the xsuch that (x twaddles potatoes)).A central question in the study of intona-tion is what factors govern accent placement.
Ihave argued here that argument structure plays norole in this determination at least as to prenomi-nally modified noun phrases and have shown how atheory of focus like the one presented in Selkirk1984 can be refined to account for semantic on-straints for accent placement.ReferencesBolinger, Dwight.
