Clinical Terms) terminologycontent to Basque, a less resourced lan-guage.
Thus, it would be possible to builda new clinical healthcare terminology forBasque.
We have designed the translationalgorithm and the first two phases of thealgorithm that feed the SNOMED CT?sTerminology content, have been imple-mented (it is composed of four phases).The goal of the translation is twofold: theenforcement of the use of Basque in thebio-sanitary area and the access to a richmultilingual resource in our language.1 IntroductionSNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT)(IHTSDO, 2014) is considered the most com-prehensive, multilingual clinical healthcareterminology in the world.
The use of a standardclinical terminology improves the quality andhealth care by enabling consistent representationof meaning in an electronic health record1.Osakidetza, the Basque Sanitary System oughtto provide its service in the two co-official lan-guages of the Basque Autonomous Community,in Spanish and in Basque.
However, and beingBasque a minority language in front of the power-ful Spanish language, the use of Basque in the doc-umentation services (for example in the ElectronicMedical Records (EMR)) of Osakidetza, is almostzero.
One of our goals in this work is to offer amedical terminology in Basque to the bio-medicalpersonnel to try to enforce the use of Basque inthe bio-sanitary area and in this way protect the1http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/whysnomedct/snomedfeatures/linguistic rights of patients and doctors.
Anotherobjective in this work is to be able to access multi-lingual medical resources in Basque language.
Totry to reach the mentioned objectives, we want tosemi-automatically translate the terminology con-tent of SNOMED CT focusing in some of its mainhierarchies.To achieve our translation goal, we have definedan algorithm that is based on Natural LanguageProcessing (NLP) techniques and that is composedof four phases.
In this paper we show the systemsand results obtained when developing the first twophases of the algorithm that, in this case, trans-lates English terms into Basque.
The first phaseof the algorithm is based on the use of multilin-gual lexical resources, while the second one usesa finite-state approach to obtain Basque equivalentterms using medical affixes and also transcriptionrules.In this paper we will leave aside explanationsabout i) the translation application, ii) the knowl-edge management and iii) the knowledge repre-sentation, and we will focus on term generation.The application framework that manages the termshas been already developed and it is in use.
Theknowledge representation schema has been de-signed and implemented and it is also being used(Perez-de-Vin?aspre and Oronoz, 2013).In the rest of the paper after motivating the workand connecting it to other SNOMED CT transla-tions (sections 2 and 3), the algorithm and the ma-terial that are needed to implement the first twophases of the translation-algorithm are described(section 4).
After that, results are shown and dis-cussed (sections 5 and 6).
Finally, some conclu-sions and future work are listed in the last section(section 7).2 Background and significance?Basque is the ancestral language of the Basquepeople, who inhabit the Basque Country, a region38spanning an area in northeastern Spain and south-western France.
It is spoken by 27% of Basques inall territories (714,136 out of 2,648,998).
Of these,663,035 live in the Spanish part of the Basquecountry (Basque Country and Navarre) and the re-maining 51,100 live in the French part (Pyre?ne?es-Atlantiques)2?.
Basque is a minority language inits standardization process and persists betweentwo powerful languages, Spanish and French.
Al-though today Basque holds co-official languagestatus in the Basque Autonomous Community,during centuries Basque was not an official lan-guage; it was out of educational systems, out ofmedia, and out of industrial environments.
Due tothis features, the use of the Basque Language inthe bio-sanitary system is low.
One of the reasonsfor translating SNOMED CT is to try to increasethe use of the Basque language in this area.SNOMED CT is a multilingual resource as itsconcepts are linked to terms in different languagesby means of a concept identifier.
Thus, terms inour language will be linked to terms in all the lan-guages in which SNOMED CT is released.
Be-sides, as SNOMED CT is part of the Metathe-saurus of UMLS (Unified Medical Language Sys-tem (Bodenreider, 2004)), Basque speakers willhave the possibility of accessing other lexical med-ical resources (RxNorm, MeSH) containing theconcepts of SNOMED CT.SNOMED CT has been already translated toother languages using different techniques.
Thesetranslations were done either manually (this is thecase of the Danish language (Petersen, 2011)),combining automatic translation with manualwork (in Chinese, for example (Zhu et al., 2012)),or using exclusively an automatic translation help-ing system (that is the case of French (Abdoune etal., 2011)).
In the design of the translation task,we have followed the guidelines for the transla-tion of SNOMED CT (H?y, 2010) published bythe IHTSDO as it is recommended.3 SNOMED CTSNOMED CT provides the core terminology forelectronic health records and contains more than296,000 active concepts with their descriptions or-ganized into hierarchies.
(Humphreys et al., 1997)shows that SNOMED CT has an acceptable cov-erage of the terminology needed to record patient2http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque language (January23, 2014)conditions.
Concepts are defined by means of de-scription logic axioms and are used also to groupterms with the same meaning.
Those descriptionsare more generally considered as terms.There are three types of descriptions inSNOMEDCT: Fully Specified Names (FSN), Pre-ferred Terms (PT) and Synonyms.
Fully Speci-fied Names are the descriptions used to identifythe concepts and they usually have a semantic tagin parenthesis that indicates its semantic type and,consequently, its hierarchy.
Regarding what wesometimes refer to as ?terms?
we can distinguishbetween PTs and Synonyms.There are 19 hierarchies to organize the con-tent of SNOMED CT (plus 1 hierarchy for meta-data).
The concepts of SNOMED CT are groupedinto hierarchies as Clinical finding/disorder, Or-ganism, and so on.
For translation purposes it isimportant to deeply analyze these hierarchies assome of them need to translate all the terms whileothers as Organism only admit the translation ofthe synonyms (the preferred term should be thetaxonomic one).
The guidelines for the transla-tion of the hierarchies are given in (H?y, 2010).We want to remark that only the terms classifiedas PTs and synonyms in SNOMED CT have beentaken into consideration for the translation pur-poses, as the structure (relationships, for example)is the ontological core of SNOMED CT.Considering the lexical resources available inthe bio-sanitary domain for Basque and theSNOMED CT language versions released, twosource languages can be used for our translationtask: English and Spanish.
Basque is classified asa language isolate, and in consequence it is not re-lated to English or Spanish and its linguistic char-acteristics are far away from both of them.
For thatreason, no English nor Spanish offers any advan-tage as translation source.
Thus, we deeply ana-lyzed both of them to choose the best option.
Ourstarting point was the Release Format 2 (RF2),Snapshot distributions and the versions dated the31-07-2012 for English and the 30-10-2012 forSpanish.
It must be taken into consideration thatthe Spanish version of SNOMED CT is a manualtranslation of the English version.To choose the source version of SNOMED CTthat will be translated, we analyzed aspects as i)general numbers of FSNs, PTs and Synonyms, ii)length of the terms in each language and, ii) thelack of elements in each version.
These data help39us to come to a decision:1.
The number of active concepts in both lan-guages is the same (296,433) as the Spanishversion uses the English concept file.
Nev-ertheless, the number of terms in Spanish issignificantly smaller.
In Spanish 15,715 con-cepts lack of PTs and Synonyms.2.
Regarding the length of the PTs and syn-onyms, we counted the terms containing onetoken, two tokens, three tokens, four tokensand those with more than four tokens.
In theEnglish version the 6.76% of the terms hasone token, the 23.28% two and the 20.70%three tokens.
That is, quite simple terms com-pose the half of the synonyms in the lexicon.In the Spanish version, nevertheless, only the33.79% of the synonyms has three tokens orless, and there are 66.21% synonyms withfour tokens or more.Considering these data, we can conclude that i)the English version is more complete and consis-tent than the Spanish one, and that ii) the termsin the English version are shorter in length and, inconsequence, simpler to translate than the ones inthe Spanish version.
Thus, we decided to use theEnglish version of SNOMEDCT as the translationsource as starting point.We fix the priority between hierarchies for thetranslation taking into account the number ofterms in each hierarchy.
The most populated hi-erarchies are Clinical finding/disorder (139,643concepts) and Procedure (75,078 concepts).
Thenext most populated hierarchies are Organism(35,870 concepts) and Body Structure (26,960).The translation guidelines indicate that the PTsof the organisms should not be translated.
Forthis reason and being conscious of our limita-tion to translate this huge terminology, we decidedto prioritize the translation of the Clinical find-ing/disorder, the Procedure and the Body Struc-ture hierarchies.4 Translation AlgorithmWe have defined a general algorithm that tries toachieve the translation with an incremental ap-proach.
Although the design is general and the al-gorithm could be used for any language pair, somelinguistic resources for the source and objectivelanguages are necessary.
In our implementation,the algorithm takes a term in English as input andobtains one or more equivalent terms in Basque.The mapping of SNOMED CT with ICD-10works at concept level.
Thus, before executing theimplementation of the algorithm the mapping be-tween them should be done (see section 5).The algorithm is composed of four main phases.The first two phases are already developed and re-sults regarding quantities are given in section 5.The last two phases will be undertaken in the verynear future.We want to remark that all the processes fin-ish in the step numbered as 4 in the algorithm(see Figure 1).
The Basque equivalents with theiroriginal English terms, and relative information(for instance, the SNOMED CT concept identi-fier) are stored in an XML document that followsthe TermBase eXchange (TBX) (Melby, 2012) in-ternational standard (ISO 30042) as exposed in(Perez-de-Vin?aspre and Oronoz, 2013).
All thelexical resources are stored in another simplerTBX document called ItzulDB (see number 1 inFigure 1).
This document is initialized with allthe lexical resources available, such as specializeddictionaries and it is enriched with the new trans-lation pairs generated that overcome a confidencethreshold with the intention of using them to trans-late new terms.
In this way we achieve feedback.Let us describe the main phases:1.
Lexical knowledge.
In this phase of the al-gorithm (see numbers 1-2-4 in Figure 1),some specialized dictionaries and the En-glish, Spanish and Basque versions of the In-ternational Statistical Classification of Dis-eases and Related Health in its 10th ver-sion (ICD-10) are used.
ItzulDB is initial-ized with all the translation pairs (English-Basque) extracted from different dictionariesof the bio-medical domain and the pairs ex-tracted from the ICD-10.
For example the in-put term ?abortus?
will be stored with all itsBasque equivalents ?abortu?, ?abortatze?and ?hilaurtze?.
This XML database is en-riched with the new elements that are gener-ated when the algorithm is applied (number 4in Figure 1).
Figure 2 shows an example ofsome translations obtained using ItzulDB.2.
Morphosemantics.
When a simple term (termwith a unique token) is not found in ItzulDB(number 3 in Figure 1) it is analyzed at word-level, and some generation-rules are used to40Figure 1: Schema of the Algorithm.Input term: Deoxyribonuclic acidSteps in Figure 1 number: 1,2,4Translation: Azido desoxirribonukleiko,ADN, DNAFigure 2: Terms obtained from ItzulDB.create the translation.
We apply medical suf-fix and prefix equivalences and morphotacticrules, as well as some transcription rules, forthis purpose.
This is the case in Figure 3.Input term: PhotodermatitisSteps in Figure 1 number: 3,5,7,6,4Applied rules:Identified parts: photo+dermat+itisTranslated parts: foto+dermat+itisTranslation: FotodermatitisFigure 3: Terms obtained using generation-rules.3.
Shallow Syntax.
In the case that the inputterm does not appear in ItzulDB and it cannot be generated by word-level rules (number8 in the algorithm), chunk-level generationrules are used.
Our hypothesis is that somechunks of the term will appear in ItzulDBwith their translation.
The application shouldgenerate the entire term using the translatedcomponents (see example in Figure 4).Input term: Deoxyribonucleic acid sampleSteps in Figure 1 number: 8, 9, 10, 6, 4Chunks in ItzulDB:1st chunk: Deoxyribonucleic acidBasque: azido desoxirribonukleiko,ADN, DNA2nd chunk: sampleBasque: laginTranslation: Azido desoxirribonukleikoarenlagin, ADN lagin, DNA laginFigure 4: Terms obtained using chunk-level gen-eration rules.4.
Machine Translation.
In the last phase, ouraim is to use a rule-based automatic trans-lation system called Matxin (Mayor et al.,2011) that we want to adapt to the medicaldomain.
Figure 5 shows an attempt of trans-lation with the non adapted translator.
For ex-ample, Matxin translates ?colon?
as the punc-tuation mark (?bi puntu?
or ?:?)
because itlacks the anatomical meaning.Input term: Partial excision of oesophagusand interposition of colonSteps in Figure 1 number: 12, 4Translation: Esofagoaren zati baten exci-siona eta interpositiona bi puntuaFigure 5: Terms obtained using Matxin.The IHTSDO organization releases a semi-automatic mapping between SNOMED CT andthe ICD-10.
By identifying the sense of a con-cept in SNOMED CT, the best semantic space inthe ICD-10 for this concept is searched obtaininglinked codes.
In this way we can obtain the corre-sponding Basque term for some of the SNOMEDCT concepts through ICD-10.
Considering thatthe structures of SNOMED CT and the ICD-10are quite different, and that the mapping some-times has ?mapping conditions?, the use of this41resource has been complex, but fruitful for veryspecialised terms.
Although as we said this map-ping is the unique source for obtaining very spe-cialised terms, it should be used carefully as theobjectives of SNOMED CT and ICD-10 are dif-ferent.
ICD-10 has classification purposes whileSNOMED CT has representation purposes.A brief description of the first two phases of thealgorithm is done in the next subsections (subsec-tions 4.1 and 4.2):4.1 Phase 1: Lexical ResourcesThe multilingual specialized dictionaries with En-glish and Basque equivalences that have been usedto enrich ItzulDB in the first phase of the algorithmare:?

ICD-105: This classification of diseases wastranslated into Basque in 1996.
It is alsoavailable in English and in Spanish.

EuskalTerm6: This terminology bank con-tains 75,860 entries from wich 26,597 termequivalences are labeled as from the biomed-ical domain.?
Elhuyar Dictionary7: This English-Basquedictionary, is a general dictionary that con-tains 39,164 equivalences from English toBasque.All these quite different dictionaries have beenpreprocessed in order to initialize ItzulDB.
Elhu-yar Dictionary is a general dictionary that has3http://zthiztegia.elhuyar.org4http://www.ehu.es/euskalosasuna/Erizaintza2.pdf5http://www.ehu.es/PAT/Glosarios/GNS10.txt6http://www.euskadi.net/euskalterm7http://hiztegiak.elhuyar.org/enboth not domains pairs but also contains some spe-cialized terminology.
This general dictionary willhelp i) in the translation of not domain terms andii) also in the translation of the chunks in Phase3, and thus, on the generation of new terms inBasque.4.2 Phase 2: Finite State Transducers andBiomedical AffixesA first approach to this work is presented in(Perez-de-Vin?aspre et al., 2013).
In that work, fi-nite state transducers described in Foma (Hulden,2009) are used to automatically identify the affixesin English Medical terms and by means of affixtranslation pairs, to generate the equivalent termsin Basque.
We observed that the behavior of theroots in this type of words is similar to prefixes, so,we will not make distinction between them and wewill name them prefixes.
A list of 826 prefixes and143 suffixes with medical meanings was manuallytranslated.
An evaluation of the system was per-formed in a Gold Standard of 885 English-Basquepairs.
The Gold Standard was composed of thesimple terms that were previously translated in thefirst phase of the algorithm.
A precision of 93%and a recall of 41% were obtained.In that occasion, only SNOMED CT terms forwhich all the prefixes and suffixes were identifiedwere translated.
For example, terms with the pref-fix ?phat?
were not translated as this affix doesnot appear in the prefixes and suffixes list.
Forinstance, the ?hypophosphatemia?
term was nottranslated even though the ?hypo?, ?phos?
and?emia?
affixes were identified.We have improved this work by increasing thenumber of affixes and implementing transcriptionrules from English/Latin/Greek to Basque.Figure 6 will help us to get a wider view ofthe work exposed.
The input term ?symphys-iolysis?
is split into the possible affix combi-nation in the first step (?sym+physio+lysis?
or?sym+physi+o+lysis?).
Then, those affixes aretranslated by means of its equivalents in Basque(?sim+fisio+lisi?
or ?sim+fisi+o+lisi?).
And fi-nally, by means of morphotactic rules, the well-formed Basque term is composed (in both cases?sinfisiolisi?
is generated).5 ResultsConsidering the huge size of the descriptions inSNOMED CT and to make the translation pro-42Table 1: Results of the translation.Disorder Finding Body Structure Procedure#Synonyms #Matches #Synonyms #Matches #Synonyms #Matches #Synonyms #MatchesICD-10 mapping 11,227 - 1,878 - 0 - 0 -In dictionaries 4,804 3,488 1,836 915 5,896 2,992 778 473ZT Dictionary 1,104 883 367 311 1,812 1,212 293 253Nursing Dictionary 437 350 340 245 978 725 199 157Glossary of Anatomy 3 3 10 8 1,982 1,431 2 2ICD-10 2,434 2,308 216 195 410 370 5 4EuskalTerm 906 596 442 306 2,346 1,423 202 155Elhuyar 299 135 956 300 1,090 367 270 91Morphosemantics 2,620 2,184 705 578 970 779 1,551 1,362Total 17,627 5,672 4,419 1,493 6,866 3,771 2,329 1,835Input term: symphysiolysisIdentified affixes: sym+physio+lysis,sym+physi+o+lysisTranslation of the affixes: sim+fisio+lisi,sim+fisi+o+lisiMorphotactics output term: sinfisiolisiFigure 6: Term translated by means of affix equiv-alences.cess easy to handle, we have divided it into hier-archies.
The Clinical finding/disorder hierarchy isspecially populated so we have split it consider-ing its semantic tags: disorders and findings.
Inaddition, the terms from the Procedure and BodyStructure hierarchies have been evaluated too.Before showing the results, we want to remarksome aspects of the evaluation:?
Phase 1: the evaluation has been performedin terms of quantity, not of quality of theequivalent terms obtained.
As the used re-sources are dictionaries manually generatedby lexicographers and domain experts, thequality of the Basque terms is assumed.
Inany case, and due to the fact that Basque is inits standardization process, the orthographiccorrectness of the descriptions (see section 6)will be manually checked in the near future.?
Phase 2: the quality of the generated termscould be measured extrapolating the resultsin the evaluation of the baseline system de-scribed in subsection 4.2.
That is, 93% pre-cision and 41% recall.
The quantity resultsare shown considering the improvements de-scribed in the same subsection.Table 1 shows the results for the mentioned hi-erarchies and semantic tags when the translation isperformed using both methods: dictionary match-ing and morphosemantics.
Remind that in a pre-vious phase a concept level mapping is completedbetween SNOMED CT and ICD-10.
The first rowin Table 1 labeled as ?ICD-10 mapping?
showsthat it is relevant only for the Clinical disordersand findings hierarchy, being the disorder seman-tic tag the most benefited one with 11,228 equiv-alences.
The remainder of the results is given atterm level.We made a distinction between the number ofobtained Basque terms (1st column, labeled as?#Synonyms?)
and the number of English termstranslated (2nd column, labeled as ?#Matches?
).Let us see the difference between those twocolumns looking at the numbers in Table 1.
For ex-ample, in the disorder semantic tag there are 3,488matches (3,488 original English terms translated),but the number of obtained Basque terms is 4,804(adding the number of equivalents of all the dic-tionaries).
The reason is that the same input termmay have synonyms or even the same equivalentterm given by different dictionaries.
For example,for the term ?allopathy?, the same term ?alopatia?is obtained in the ZT and Nursing dictionaries (thisequivalence will be counted in both ZT and Nurs-ing dictionaries rows).Table 2 shows the number of tokens in the origi-nal English terms.
This table refers not to the con-cepts, but to the terms in the source SNOMED CTin English.
The first row shows the number of En-glish terms to which we obtained a Basque equiv-alent or synonym, the second one the total of En-glish terms and finally, the last row the percentageof translated terms.Table 3 gives the overall numbers of the trans-lated concepts, in order to take a wide view of theprocess done.Let us see the highlights of the results for each43Table 2: Results of the translation regarding the number of tokens of the original term.1 token 2 tokens 3 tokens 4 tokens > 4 tokens TotalTranslated Terms 3,315 1,114 538 279 426 5,672Disorder Terms in total 4,066 22,023 24,036 20,005 37,316 107,446Percentage 81.53% 5.06% 2.24% 1.40% 1.14% 5.27%Translated Terms 1,222 158 39 20 54 1,493Finding Terms in total 1,830 8,837 10,980 9,814 19,106 50,567Percentage 66.78% 1.79% 0.36% 0.20% 0.28% 2.95%Translated Terms 1,942 1,416 334 66 13 3,771Body Structure Terms in total 2,692 11,519 12,575 10,903 21,631 59,320Percentage 72.14% 12.29% 2.66% 0.61% 0.06% 6.36%Translated Terms 1,741 80 11 2 1 1,835Procedure Terms in total 1,982 9,966 15,848 16,578 37,695 82,069Percentage 87.84% 0.80% 0.07% 0.01% 0.003% 2.24%Table 3: Overall results.Disorder Finding Body Structure ProcedureTranslated Concepts 14,125 2,777 3,231 1,502Concepts in total 65,386 33,204 31,105 82,069Percentage 21.60% 8.36% 10.39% 1.83%hierarchy or semantic tag:?
21.60% of the disorders has been translated(see Table 3).
This can be considered a verygood result.
The ICD-10 mapping producesthe majority of the translations as it could beexpected in this hierarchy (11,227 synonymsobtained).
In Table 2 the strength of the mor-phosemantics phase is evident as the 81.53%of the simple terms is translated.?
The finding semantic tag is the most bal-anced, as no one of the algorithm phase?scontribution outlines.
The translation of the8.36% of the concepts is achieved.?
Regarding the results of the Body Structurehierarchy, Table 1 shows that the Glossary ofAnatomy only contributes in this area.
The10.39% of the concepts get a Basque equiva-lent.?
In the translation of the Procedure hierarchythe dictionaries do not help much as shownin Table 1.
In contrast, the mophosemanticscontribution allows to translate the 87.84% ofthe simple terms (see Table 2).6 DiscussionSome general dictionaries as the ZT dictionaryusually contribute in the translation of most of theterms, while more specialized dictionaries onlyprovide translations in the terms related to theirdomain.
For example, both dictionaries, the ZTdictionary and the Nursing dictionary, obtained theBasque terms ?mikrozefalia?
for ?microcephaly?and ?metatartso?
for ?metatarsus?.
The ICD-10mapping contributed mainly in the translation ofthe disorders, and the Glossary of Anatomy in thetranslation of terms from the Body Structure hi-erarchy.
Sometimes more than an equivalent inBasque is obtained in the translation.
For exam-ple, for the term ?leprosy?
we got the equivalents?legen beltz?, ?legen?
and ?legenar?.
Some prob-lems were detected in the Basque terms regardingthe standard orthography (the ICD-10 was trans-lated in 1996 and the spelling rules have changedsince then) and the form of the word (some obtainthe word in finite forms, i.e.
?abdomena?
for ?ab-domen?
and other in non finite form, ?abdomen?
).To which the terms generated by finite-statetransducers concern, we detected many new af-fixes from the SNOMED CT terms that do not ap-pear in our lexicon.
Even most of those affixeswill be correctly transcripted by our transducers,experts insist on enriching the lexicon with newpairs.7 ConclusionsWe have designed a translation algorithm for themultilingual terminology content of SNOMEDCTand we have implemented the first two phases.
Onthe one hand, lexical resources feed our database,and on the other hand, Basque equivalents are gen-erated using transducers and medical and biologi-44cal affixes.Dictionaries provide Basque equivalents of anyterm length (i.e.
unique and multitoken terms)while transducers get as input unique token terms.In both translation methods results for the mostpopulated hierarchies are shown even though theyare applied for all the hierarchies in SNOMEDCT.When using lexical resources, results are promis-ing and the contribution of the ICD-10 mappingis remarkable.
We obtained the equivalents inBasque of 21.60% of the disorders.In any case, as we said before, our objective inthe future is that specialist in medical terminol-ogy can check the quality of the obtained termsand correct them with the help of a domain cor-pus in Basque.
A platform is being developed forthis purpose.
After the evaluation, and only if itreaches high quality results, our aim is to contactSNOMEDCT providers to offer them the result ofour work, that at the moment only pertains to theresearch area.Regarding the developed systems evaluation,the system used in the first phase extracts English-Basque pairs from dictionaries, so being quite asimple system, does not need of a deep evalua-tion.
A first evaluation of the system that generatesterms using medical affixes has been presented.At present, we are evaluating the improvements ofthis second system with promising results.In a near future, we want to implement the re-mainder of the phases in the algorithm: the use ofsyntax rules for term generation, and the adapta-tion of the machine translation tool.
The promis-ing results in this first approximation encourage usin the way to semi-automatically generate a ver-sion in Basque of SNOMED CT.AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank Mikel Lersundifor his help.
