Distinguishing Questions by ContourSpeech Recognition TasksJu l ia HirschbergAT&T Bell Laborator ies600 Mounta in  AvenueMurray Hill NJ  07974October 27, 1989in1 Can We Predict  Intonat ion?It is generally acknowledged today that, while the intonational features speakersselect when they utter a sentence are not determined by the syntax, semanticsor discourse context of that sentence, knowledge of these factors can help to con-strain the possible intonational features peakers are likely to choose.
So, whileintonational variation poses a challenge to speech recognition i  one sense - inpresenting yet another indicator of over-all utterance meaning to be recognized- regularities noted between intonational features and the syntax, semantics anddiscourse features of an utterance also present rich possibilities for help in therecognition task.The many-to-many mapping between intonational features and syntactic anddiscourse features can be illustrated by considering the various ways of utteringthe sentences in (1).

560 CAN KIRK GET TO KODIAK BY MONDAYb.
Kirk can get to Kodiak by Monday.For example, a senior officer might choose a falling pitch contour over (la) toconvey an indirect request hat Kirk reach Kodiak by Monday.
A less seniorspeaker, however, might produce (la) with rising (yes-no question) intonation,conveying merely a request for information.
Alternatively, the syntacticallyrelated but distinct form of (la), (lb), might be produced with rising intonationto convey the same request for information, or with falling intonation to conveythe information thus requested.
So, different contours can be used over the same1Exaxaple sentences in this paper axe taken from the DARPA Resource Managementdatabase.22sentence to convey different meanings, and the same contour may be used oversentences differing only in syntactic structure to convey a similar meaning.Despite such possibilities for variation, research in intonational meaning andmore practical application of such research in speech synthesis indicates thatthere are  regularities that recognition systems may be able to utilize.
For ex-ample, knowledge of likely relationships between syntax and intonation tell usthat, when (lb) is uttered in natural speech, it will be more likely to be saidwith falling intonation than with rising.
And given that we know the speaker of(la) and have some rough idea of that speaker's authority, we can also predictwhether that speaker will be likely to use rising intonation or not, based onwhether that speaker will be likely to be trying to convey an indirect request orsimply to gain information.
So, knowledge of the structure of an utterance andknowledge of the overall context in which it is uttered help to constrain the setof intonational possibilities.
Thus, intonational features uch as contour typeprovide indirect evidence as to what the syntactic structure of the associatedsentence might be, given that we know the likelihood that a sentence like (la)might be uttered to convey an indirect request rather than a request for infor-mation.
That is, in the general case, given that we know the likely utterer of(la) to be a clerk, we will expect (la) to be uttered as a request for information,and, thus with rising intonation.2 Can We Use Intonat ional  Information to AidSpeech Recognit ion?Interest in using higher-level intonational information such as pitch contour,intonational phrasing, and pitch accent placement to aid speech recognition hasbeen intermittent.\[Lea79, Pie83, Wai88\] Progress in this area has been hinderedby a) the difficulty of extracting higher level intonational characteristics auto-matically with any reliability; b) the lack of representations of the features tobe extracted such that information can be incorporated into the recognitionprocess; and c) an imperfect understanding of the particular constraints syntax,semantics and discourse features impose on a speaker's choice of intonationalfeatures.
Thus, practical problems of feature detection have gone hand in handwith more theoretical issues of representation a d interpretation.
However,there has been some progress in developing algorithms to extract and identifyat least partial information about higher-level intonational features, uch as dif-ferentiation of stressed and unstressed syllables and distinction of rising fromfalling contours.At this stage, it does seem likely, that particular recognition tasks and par-ticular domains will find some higher-level intonational cues more useful thanothers.
For testing the utility of predicting the syntactic 'type' of an utterancefrom its intonational contour, for example, domains in which there are broad23classes of utterances which can be reliably partitioned according to both into-national and syntactic ategory appear promising.
Database query tasks, forexample, where there is a reasonable balance between inverted yes-no questions 2,which are commonly uttered with final rising intonation, and wh-questions 3, orimperatives 4, which are both commonly uttered with final fall - -  and in whichthere is relatively little likelihood of speech act ambiguity, seem well-suitedto such an experiment.
The DARPA Resource Management (RM) task thusseemed a good place to look for such distinctions.In domains uch as this, we might expect that distinguishing likely yes-noquestions from other sentences might be a useful augmentation for traditionalrecognition methodologies, acting as a filter on matches proposed by the rec-ognizer or even providing an initial state in a regular grammar partitioned bybroad syntactic 'type'.
5 The utility of adding such information is supportedby certain classes of recognition errors, such as those illustrated in (2).
6 Theseerrors represent instances in which the ability to distinguish yes-no questionsintonationally from wh-questions, imperatives, and other sentence 'types' typ-ically uttered with falling intonation might serve as an aid to recognition (Ineach case, the (a) sentences represents the test sentence and the (b) sentencerepresents the recognizer's hypothesis.

'.3Questions beginning with who, what, when, where or how.4Such as 'D ISPLAY METEOR4-S LON USING OVERLAY BOX '.SThat is, inverted yes-no questions might be separated from other syntactic onstructionsin the grammar.6These were some of the errors made on the DARPA February89 training set by one of theBell Labs recognizers.\[Lee89, LRPW89\]24hypothesized by the recognizer.
Among these errors, distinguishing between'when'll' and 'will' and between 'what is' and 'was' would appear to be partic-ularly difficult tasks for a recognizer on acoustic grounds.
In fact, about 8% ofsentence rrors made in this test were due at least in part to one of these twoconfusions.
Table 1 shows all sentence errors in the test run in which yes-no ques-tions were confused with wh-questions, imperatives, or declarative sentences.

So, 'WAS ** the date and hour of arrival in portr arkansas ' was considered structural ly  a yes-no question.25rising intonation and other utterance types with falling intonation - -  15 of themisrecognized utterances in fact were spoken with the 'likely' contour for theirsyntactic type.
That is, in fifteen cases a yes-no question uttered with risingintonation was misrecognized as a syntactic type (wh-question or imperative)which would have been unlikely to have been uttered with rising intonation -or a non-yes-no question uttered with falling intonation was misrecognized asayes-no question.However, while these errors might thus have been filtered by this simpleassociation between contour and sentence type, it is not at all clear how wellthis solution might generalize ven to other sentences within the same domain.While yes-no questions are typically uttered with rising intonation in naturalspeech - -  and wh-questions and imperatives commonly uttered with utterance-final fall, it is not clear whether such distinctions appear with the same likelihoodin sentences read in isolation, the data which most recognizers train and testupon.
To investigate the possibility then of predicting structural distinctionsfrom intonational ones, it is useful to examine the prosody of the training andtest data itself.3 Are Yes-No Questions Intonational ly Distin-guished in the RM Database?To assess the potential for using contour to distinguish inverted yes-no questionsfrom other constructions in current recognition tasks, I sampled inverted yes-no questions and wh-questions from the training and test data of the speakerindependent RM database.\[PFBP88\] Of the 2810 sentence types in the RMTable 2: Sentence Types and Tokens in the RM DatabaseTotal S-types 2810 (100%)Total Questions ~ 1694 (60%)Total YNQs ~ 670 (24%)Total WH-qs ~ 1024 (36%)\[\[ SampleYNQs_type 50YNQs_token 100WH-qs_type 53WH-qs_token 100database, approximately 60% can be classed either as inverted yes-no questions(24%) or wh-questions (36%).
I sampled 100 utterances of yes-no questions(from 50 types) and 100 utterances of wh-questions (from 53 types) to deter-26mine whether sentences were uttered with rising intonation or not.S The yes-noquestions chosen were inverted copula questions in the present tense of the form' I s  .... '; no alternative questions were included in the sample, since these tendto be uttered with falling intonation.
Both sample yes-no questions and samplewh-questions were selected from among the sentences in the database f wer than9 words in length, to minimize the likelihood of multiple intonational phrasesin the utterance or of performance error in the production of the utterance.Of the 100 yes-no questions ampled from the RM database, only 55 wereuttered with final rise.
Only 9 of the wh-questions were similarly uttered, withthe majority uttered with falling or level pitch.
While the latter results seemconsistent with previous observation about he tendency of wh-questions tofall,the findings for yes-no questions seem far too low.Table 3: RM SampleQuestion Type Non-Rising ~ Rising TotalYNQ 45 !
55 100WH-Q 91 9 100To test the representativeness of the contours in the sample, I examinedsamples of 50 inverted yes-no questions and 50 wh-questions from the TIMITdatabase (All were of distinct ypes.).
9 The results, presented in Table 4 appearmuch more consistent with observations of questions asked in natural speech.Thus, while only 55% of yes-no questions in the RM database were utteredTable 4:TIMIT1 SampleQuestion Type Non-RisingYNQ 9WH-Q 46Rising\] Total41 504 I 50with rising intonation, over 80% of yes-no questions in the TIMIT1 sample rose.Production of wh-questions appears imilar in both databases, with only 8% ofthe TIMIT1 wh-questions and 9% of the RM wk-questions uttered with finalrise.8Note that this distinction oversimplifies the distinctions observed in natural speech be-tween question-rise and question-rise, but the results of this simple analysis did not warrantmore refinement.9TIMIT has a much lower proportion of questions than the RM database, with only 142questions among TIMITI 's 1726 sentence types, some of them not syntactic yes-no questionsor wh-questions.
These were not considered in the sample.27The question then arises: why are yes-no questions produced so differentlyin the RMsentences than in the TIMIT1 sentences?
Several explanations cometo mind.
First, one might hypothesize that certain yes-no questions would bemore likely than others to be uttered with falling intonation, depending upontheir semantic ontent.
Those that might be interpreted as indirect requests,for example, like (la), might tend to be uttered with falling intonation, as notedabove.
If the RM sentences were ambiguous with respect o speech act, thenreaders might favor falling intonation with such sentences.
Unfortunately, thecontours in Figure 1 illustrate a not-uncommon finding in the sample of yes-noquestions elected from the RM database - a pair of utterances of the sameyes-no question, one uttered with a rising contour and the other with a fallingcontour; 19 other pairs reflect this dichotomy.
The commonality of varyingcontours over the same sentence type together with the fact that I avoided yes-no questions with seeming potential for speech act ambiguity in this domainmakes this explanation unlikely.A similar alternation is evident among the (many fewer) wh-questions utteredwith rising intonation, which are illustrated by f0 contours from the same twospeakers from Figure 1.
For the wh-questions, it appears likely that speakervariability might account for the rising contours, since 6 of the 9 rising wh-questions were produced by a single speaker.
However, a similar account doesnot appear possible for the 45 falling yes-no questions; no single speaker wasresponsible for more than 3.Another explanation for the results of Table 3 is suggested by the sort ofcontour illustrated in Figure 3.
The lack of variation in pitch prominence andrange shown in these f0 contours eems to be not atypical of much of the RMdatabase - -  and appears to reflect a lack of engagement in the subjects, anabsence of any attempt o reflect sentence 'meaning' in their productions, and- -  in the type of disfluencies that mark much of the data - -  some difficulty inperforming the task.
In short, the data do not appear to have been producedso as to maximize their reflection of the higher-level intonational characteristicsof natural speech.So far the discussion of contour variation in the RM database has focussedon the disparity between subject performance in these sentences and observa-tions from natural speech.
Nonetheless, even with data not intended to providematerial for detecting and using contour variation, the possibilities for usingsuch intonational cues are still substantially supported.
The difference betweensubject tendency to use rising intonation with wh-questions and with yes-noquestions, like the difference in propensity to use non-rising intonation withyes-no questions and wh-questions, is in fact still quite significant, l?
And, whileyes-no questions in the RM database are only uttered with rising intonation 55%of the time, note that approximately 86% of utterances with rising intonation in1?For example, a simple X 2 test of the data in Table 3 is significant at the .001 level (TheX 2 statistic is 48.6 with df=l.

- -Figure 2: Rising and Falling Contours over the Same WH-Question30Figure 3: Yes-No questions and WH-Questions31the sample are indeed yes-no questions.
And utterances characterized byfallingintonation are fully twice as likely to be wh-questions as yes-no questions, ac-cording to our sample.
So, even though we might expect a contour distinctionto be even more successful in recognizing data from, say, TIMIT1, even theapparently much less 'natural' data of the RM sentences provides a good casefor the idea that sentence classes might indeed be distinguished by the contourwith which they are uttered.4 Conclus ionWhile the RMsentences thus appear less than ideal in providing data for explor-ing the notion that distinguishing among general classes of pitch contour can beuseful in distinguishing among structural classes of sentence for speech recog-niz ers, this database nonetheless provides evidence that even subjects readingsentences in isolation will approximate some of the distinctions made in realspeech.
As one example, the association between contour type and sentencetype appears ignificant enough to permit overall contour type to serve as a fil-ter for recognition - at least for rising contours.
That is, a rising contour shouldbe a fairly reliable indicator of a yes-no question.Nonetheless, it is also clear that this association should be providing evenbetter discriminatory power than it does in this database.
If future data collec-tion efforts are to support more sophisticated uses of higher-level intonationalinformation in the aid of speech recognition, then the standard ata-collectionparadigm of sentences read in isolation must certainly be abandoned.
Just asrecognizing connected speech poses different problems from isolated word recog-nition, recognizing real, interactive speech poses different problems from recog-nizing isolated sentences.
In natural speech, speakers use intonation to conveythe meaning of a sentence and to convey relationships between that meaning andthe meanings of other sentences.
But speakers will not use prosody to conveymeaning unless they understand the meaning to be conveyed.
And speakers willnot use prosody to convey relationships among sentences in a discourse if theyare not generating larger pieces of text.
So long as recognition systems are testedmerely on isolated sentences, ofcourse, the difference between training and testdata will be less important.
But systems that are expected to supported evenminimally longer dialogues will suffer, since intonational contours, phrasing,and stress assignment in interactive speech will vary significantly from isolatedsentence data.
In sum, training data and test data should mimic as much aspossible the speech recognizers hope to recognize if both the problems presentedby intonational variability and the possiblities presented by intonational regu-larities are to be adequately explored.32References\[Lea79\]\[Lee89\]\[LRPW891\[PFBP88\]W.
