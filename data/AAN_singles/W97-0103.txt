!Commerc ia l  Impact  of VLC ResearchHoward TurtleChief ScientistWest Groupturtle~research.westlaw.comTen years ago, large corpora were mainly available to industrial research groups;academic access to very large bodies of text was limited.
Today a nllmber of largecorpora re available and research using these resources has expanded well beyondthe relatively small industrial research community.
This expanded research commu-nity has significantly enlarged the scope of VLC research.
Today's research resultsare enabling new products and are leading to fundamental changes in the businessmodels of traditional publishers and online service providers.In this talk I identify areas of research that are likely to have significant commer-cial impact either because they enable new products or because they change thetraditional economics of information delivery.
I illustrate the impact hat this re-search can have with a case study describing the development of KeyCite, a newcitator product hat would not have been possible without current generation textextraction and classification techniques.
