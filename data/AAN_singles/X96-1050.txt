Meade, MDE-mail: tsw @ aftedife.ncsc.milIntroduction*Japanese was one of the languages selected forevaluation of named entity identification algorithms inthe TIPSTER-sponsored Multilingual Entity Task(MET) program.
As with the Spanish and Chinesegroups (Table 1), Japanese systems automatically markedthe names of organizations, people, and places withinentity name xpressions (ENAMEX), dates and timeswithin time expressions (TIMEX), and percents andmoney within number expressions (NUMEX).
Theparticipant Japanese systems were developed in a four-month period of time and output results comparable tothe Message Understanding Conference-6 (MUC-6) \[1\]English language systems with F-Measures between 70 -90% \[21.I Japanese Spanish ChineseMitre Mitre MitreNMSU NMSU NMSUsRASRI sRABBN/Treasury BBNNEC/Sheffield| NTT DataTable 1: MET ParticipantsThe CorpusSince MET was designed to tackle the MUC-6named entity task in foreign languages, the governmentneeded to acquire acorpus of articles rich in references topeople, places, and organizations.
A search of Kyodonewswire data using the keyword "~.~.
, "(press conference) yielded the desired 100-articledevelopment and 100-article test corpora.
In the testcorpus, 71% of the tags were of the ENAMEX type; thatis, the tagged items were references toorganizations,people, and places (Table 2).
By conU:ast, for example,the 150-article TIPSTER Phase I test corpus containedonly 75 instances of person names, or just 1% of allcorpus tags \[3\].Tag Type % of Test CorpusENAMEX 71%ORG 25PERSON 14LOC 32TIMEX 26DATE 19TIME 7NUMEX 3PERCENT 2MONEY 1Table 2: Distribution of Tag TypesHuman PerformanceOne motivation for conducting the named entity taskin a foreign language such as Japanese was to promotetechniques for tackling language-specific d fficulties inrecognizing the names of people and organizations.Unlike English, Japanese cannot rely upon orthographicclues like capitalization toidentify proper nouns.
Forthis reason, and based upon the authors' own manualtagging experience, we felt that identification ofENAMEX types would be the most challenging to theparticipant systems.
(See Hard Tag Type below)The government MET Japanese team was accordedthe opportunity o test this hypothesis dunng the courseof preparing dry-run keys for the initial systems test inearly April.
Each of us manually tagged the same 25articles, then looked at the resulting annotator variation.The discrepancies between the two sets of tagged atawere discussed and resolved.
The final product formedground truth or the keys against which the automaticparticipant systems were scored.
Each of our originalmanually tagged versions was also scored against thekeys.
The figures in Table 3 are similar due to the smallnumber of articles and lack of degradation i  humanperformance over the short period of time it took for eachof us to tag (average: <5 minutes per article).Nonetheless, the ORGANIZATION and LOCATIONsubtypes were the most prone to error.This material has been reviewed by the CIA.
That reviewneither constitutes CIA authentication of information nor impliesCIA endorsement of the author's views.449\[Ta~ TypeMONEYTIMEDATEPERSONLOCATIONPERCENTORGANIZATIONAverage F Measure100%10099.7599.759796.596Table 3: Human PerformanceTable 4 shows the group average F-Measures for theparticipant systems against both the dry-run and testkeys.

Typically, MONEY wasspecified by an Arabic numeral + a monetary unit inkatakana, e.g., "2  ~ Iz/P '' ($200 million).
Theoccasional mistake made by the systems involved notidentifying a monetary unit other than the predominantdollar or yen such as "7~ ~ \]?"
(British pound).TIME expressions were also straightforward in theirmanner of representation.
Examples of valid tagsincluded "0930," ~"  (morning), "zt:~-~ 5 I~,~"(5 PM), etc.
An anomalous string such as"zt:~lt ,~'~" g (past midnight), in whichthe kanji "~"  was used rather than the numeral "0,"caused problems for some systems.DATEThe Japanese participant systems processed DATEexpressions successfully despite the denmnds made by theMET Japanese Guidelines \[4\] concerning what should betagged and the wealth of patterns used to represent thoseexpressions.
In addition to absolute DATEs such as"2 6 I~" (26th) and "~\ [~"  (Tuesday)MET Guidelines tipulated that relative DATEs such as"~ 7 ~"  (next year July) were to beidentified as well.While the entity name expressions were relativelydifficult o handle, the number (NUMEX) and time(TIMEX) expressions encompassing the tag subtypesPERCENT & MONEY and TIME & DATE,respectively, were handled proficiently by the participantsystems.
As Table 4 shows, the group average F-Measure for these tag types was over 90% on the testd~!aPERCENTAs in English, the typical Japanese contextualpattern for generating a valid PERCENT tag was anArabic numeral + the "%" sign, e.g., "70%."
The factthat the systems collectively scored less than 100%(96%) indicates that this pattern was not universal.Indeed, the Japanese development and test articlesrepresented percentages in various other ways such as anArabic numeral + the kanji (Chinese character) forpercent" 7 ~|;" an Arabic numeral + the katakana(foreign loan-word script) for percent, e.g.," 7 0 ~- -~ ~, ;" and a kanji numeral +the kanji for percent, e.g., "-tS-~lJ."
In addition, theMET Japanese Guidelines \[4\] stipulated that fractionssuch as " 1 0 ~0D--"  (1/10), which are easilycalculable as percentages, should also be identified.Although the above-mentioned patterns are more variedthan what one typically encounters in English texts, theynevertheless constitute a standard finite list which theparticipant systems processed well.MONEY and TIMEThe contextual patterns manifested in thedevelopment and test corpora for representing MONEYThe requirement for tagging relative dates,furthermore, introduced to this task a class of Japanesesemantic attachments that complicated the identificationprocess.
Whereas "~l~" (next, coming) and "~"(last) are in the initial position of the phrases "~"(next year) and "~1~" (last year), other semanticattachments such as "~"  (end o0 or "~/J~" (early,beginning of), which add semantic ontent to the DATEexpression and are, therefore, integral parts of the DATEtag, are in the postposition of phrases.
Examples are"~ ~"  (end of the month) and" 5 Yl ~TJ ~"(early May).
It was not uncommon, therefore, toencounter in these texts semantic-laden relative DATEexpressions containing both prepositions andpostpositions, e.g., "~1 z 3 ~ ~"  (end ofMarch next year).
In the end, the Japanese systemsidentified DATEs with an extensive number of differentsemantic attachments at the average rate of 94%.Hard Tag Type: ENAMEXLOCATIONLOCATION expressions were typified by entitiesthat likely would be contained in a gazetteer o  similaron-line resource.
References to "-'f ~ ~ ~--/1/"(Israel) or "~ \[~" (U.S.) for example were readilyidentified by the systems.
Other semantic lues such asthe locative designators "~"  (prefecture) or"'}H"(state) assisted in recognizing more obscure place names.This task was complicated, however, by theprevalence ofembedded I_OCATION elements withinORGANIZATION expressions and the effects of contextupon tag type.
References to LOCATION frequently450appeared within phrases that might or might notsubsume the LOCATION under another tag.
Forinstance, "U.S.-Japan trade negotiations" would be anevent not captured by a singular tag, but by twoLOCATION tags for U.S. and Japan.
However, thereference to "~"  (U.S.)in "~ ~,J~;-~'" (U.S.Dept.
of State) was considered an integral part of theORGANIZATION name and not, therefore, segmentedand tagged separately.
Determining when to segment andnot segment the place sub-component was acomplicating factor in producing the proper tag type.Furthermore, a correctly identified ORGANIZATIONsuch as "\[~l~" (Diet) was directed by the Guidelinesto be tagged as LOCATION when the context in which itwas used indicated that he Diet was a facility or structure-- i.e., if a press conference were being held there.
Theinability of systems to handle this complex contextualshift lowered the group F-Measure average forLOCATION.PERSONAlthough there is no ready-made on-line resource forperson ames like a gazetteer for place names, (and evenif there were, its enormous size would slow substantiallyprocessing speed), valid PERSON expressions oftencontain people designators in the form of rifles, roles, orpositions uch as "~"  (Mr.), "~"  (chairman), or"~ JE~"  (president) like in".Lx,,~  # :J~z~J~" (President Mubarak).And, although the number of different designatorsmanifested throughout the corpora was sizable, theparticipant systems identified well person amesoccurring in this type of pattem.There were, however, other patterns in evidencewhich conflicted with the predominant one.
Preeminentamong these alternate patterns was the expression iwhich a rifle/position designator was preceded by both aPERSON and LOCATION, e.g.," ,z , , ,~ ~, ~7 ~ 1- ~k~"(literally: Mubarak Egypt President).
Systems typicallytagged the entire phrase preceding the title -- MubarakEgypt -- as PERSON, or Egypt alone as LOCATION.Therefore, the person ame was either mistagged ornottagged at all.ORGANIZATIONIdentifying and categorizing complex noun phrasesin strings where there is no capitalization a d whitespacemake this type of expression the most difficult o process(group F-Measure average 73%).
Normally, thecorporate designator "~"  (Co., Corp.) would assist inidentifying an ORGANIZATION.
However, the METdomain focused on political rather than commercialentities, so there were very few instances of thisdesignator.
And, although bureaucratic descriptors like"~'" indicate Japanese ministries, often well-knownministries uch as "~l~_J~'" (MITI) are aliased(~l~_J~) without mention of the canonical form.451In addition, the most prevalent entities properlyidentified as ORGANIZATION in these texts includedgroups, offices, labs, etc.
-- that is, noun phrases whichcould be proper nouns depending upon context.
Forexample, "~ ~SEJ~" could be the name of aparticular factory, Miyata Factory, or a generic factorylocated in Miyata; similarly, " J~ / i :~ / i~"could be the New Hyogo Bank, the new (e.g., rebuilt)Hyogo Bank, or a new Hyogo Bank (i.e., one bank in theHyogo Bank chain).To complicate matters further, once a complex NPlike "~.~_ j~.~.~/ Jx~"  (MITITelecommunications Subcommittee) is determined tobea proper noun, the systems next were required to tag asORGANIZATION each constituent part of thehierarchical relationship expressed within the phrase.
Inthis case, there were two: MITI (parent) andTelecommunications Subcommittee (child).SummaryThe Japanese systems showed excellent overallresults despite avery compressed development cycle.They handled comparatively easy types of expressionswith a high -- >90% -- degree of accuracy, and the hardexpressions with surprising proficiency, therebypromising marked improvement i  the near term and thecapability to work in conjunction with other languageprocessing technologies such as Machine Translation(MT) and text summadzarion \[5\].AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to thank Adina Miller and WileyHarris of ORD and Ron Dolan of the Library ofCongress for their help in the organization andpresentation f the data provided in this paper.References\[ 1\] Sundheim, Beth; Proceedings of the MessageUnderstanding Conference-6 (MUC-6); MorganKaufmann Publishers, Inc.; San Francisco, CA; 1996.\[2\] Merchant, Roberta, Okurowski, M.
