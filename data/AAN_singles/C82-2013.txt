This was one of the aims when organ iz ing  theMachine D?otionax7 of the I ta l ian  language on a databases t ruc ture .The des ign  and organ izat ion  of the iex ica l  database fo rthe f i r s t  two re la t ions  implemented, i .e .
the set  of Le~s(106, 091) and the set  of Word-forms (1 ,016,320) ,  has beendescr ibed  in  o ther  papers (see fo r  example Ca lzo la r i  and Ce?~oot t?
,  1980).These two very la rge  arch ives  are mainta ine~ cont inuous -\].7 on - l ine  and are in teract ive ly  invoked through a query lang-uage whioh permi ts  to the user  to access ,  in  t ransparent  mode,the data ,  and to have h i s  par t i cu la r  "view" of the data .
Thedatabase concept and methodology g ive r i se ,  in  fac t ,  to arad ica l  change in  perspect ive  when conf ronted with  sequent ia lo rgan izat ion  of data .
We have a dynamic ra ther  than a s ta t ioob jec t  which i s  f lex ib le  and easy to query,  update,  extend.This lex ica l  database i s  now be ing  extended by theinser t ion  of lex ioa l  de f in i t ions  (185,899) and semantic  data .The gu id ing  pr inc ip le  behind th i s  pro~ect i s  the ?onv ic t ionthat  the study of the de f in ing  vocabulary  of an ac tua l  d ic t -i onary  can provide a prec ious  too l  in  the semantic ana lys i s- 61  -of a language (see Noel, 1981).The logical or~ni~-atlon of this definitional Infoz:at-ion is not a trivial task, and must be performed bearing in.~nd the goals to be achieved.
It must in fact be possible to~ve  dlrect access to each and every piece of l~fo~t loncontained in the definitions.
The significance of "piece oflnfo1~atlon" in this context is in ~Lreot relationship to theeventual use to be made of it.
By "piece of information" in-side the definitions, we intend not only the single woe-fezes,as they are  wr i t ten  in  the  de f in i t ions ,  but a l so  the lemma,to which every  word-form i s  connected;  moreover,  a t  a fu r thers tage  o f  ana lys i s ,  the spec i f i c  sense o f  every  polysemio lemmain  the par t i cu l~r  context  (context :de f in i t ion)  must be cons id -ered?The log ica l  o r~ isat ton  o f  the de f in i t iona l  par t  o t  thedatabase  must,  there fore ,  be s t ruc tured  to prov ide ,  fo r  eachword in  every  de f iu i t ion ,  d i rec t  access  to :  a) the word.
formi t se l f ,  w i th  the assoc ia ted  in fo rmat ion  (morpho log ica l ,  usageleve l ,  e tco) ;  b) the lama to which the word-form per ta ins ,w i th  the assoc ia ted  in fo rmat ion  (par t -o f  speech,  var iants ,usage leve l  o ther  word forms i ce .
parad i~n) ;  c) the spec i f i csense o f  the le~ma?
The implementat ion  o f  a de f in i t iona l  a rch -i ve  thus requ i res  an enormous task  o f  d i ssmbi~at ion  a t  a l lthe th ree  leve ls :  word- forms,  lemmas and senses ,  in  o rder  toproduce mater ia l  which can be used e f fec t ive ly  to  ext rac tsemant ic  in fo rmat ion  f ran  the d ic t ionary .
~The f i r s t  s tep  in  th i s  d i rec t ion  ~s the lemmat iza t ion  o fthe  de f in i t ions  themselves?
For  th i s  task , the  o ther  two arch iv -es of  the database ( the  word-form and lemma~ arch ives )  ere  be-ing  used,  together  w i th  ad hoo prooedu_~es, to  produce an auto -rust ic lemmat iza t lon  o f  a la rge  percentage  of  the words con-ra ined  in  the de f i~ i t ions?
For  the o ther  words, those fo rwhich automat ic  lemmat iza t ion  has not  7et  been ach ieved ,  ad i ssmbiguat lon  s t ra te~ has been developed in  which the human- 62  -operator  works iu teraot ive ly  wi th  the computer, and thecomputer can  memorize choices on homographic forms as theyare made.A f te r  lemmat izat ion ,  each word i s  assoc ia ted  in  thecomputer memory to the addresses  of i t s  word-form and of i t slamina.
Therefore,  the de f in i t ions  are organized in  the memorynot  as ac tua l  s t r ings  of words, but as l i s t s  of addresses  ofword-forms and laminas.
In  th i s  way, a number of importantresu l t s  are achieved:  a) a great  reduct ion  in  s torage s i ze ;b) data  types (addresses  i .e .
b inary  numbers) which are eas i -l y  bandied by the computer; c) data  which are s t r i c t ly  assoc -ia ted  to the f i r s t  two arch ives ,  ~ at  the eventua l  const -ruc t ion  of an in tegrated  system; d) much more rap id  dataprocess ing  and d i rec t  accesses  to each k ind of data ,  in  eachpos i t ion  of the de f in i t ion  i t se l f ;  e) the poss ib i l i ty  of be-ing  able  to immediately re t rams la te  addresses  in to  characterstr J .ugs, and l i s t  of  addresses  in to  phrases ,  i .e .
de f in i t ions ;f )  the poss ib i l i ty  of cor rec t ing ,  updat ing  and iuser t i~w i th in  the de le t ions .0mly once th i s  prel iminsa-y stage has been completed i si t  poss ib le  to ext rac t  many k inds of semantic  in fo rmat ionfrom the d io t ionaxT.
The memorized e f in i t ions  have an in tern -a l  l og ica l  s t ruc ture  which permits  the const ruct ion  of semant-i c  cha ins  ( to  evidence taxonomic re la t ionsh ips )and  a lso  ofo ther  types of semantic l inks  ( to  evidence other  types ofsemantic re la t ionsh ips ,  such as "part o f ' ,  "set o f ' ,  " in theform o f ' ,  "apt to ' ,  e tc . )
between words in  the lex icon .
Thesecha ins  and l inks ,  which can be not  only d i sp layed ,  but  a l sohandled by computer procedures in  many d i f fe rent  ways, sure lyprovide a good s tar t ing  po in t  fo r  the study of the semantics t ruc ture  of the lex icon .
In  fac t ,  i t  i s  hoped that  the com-puter i zed  d~ct i0nary  w i l l  o f fe r  a model of the I ta l ian  lex ica lsystem in  the var ious  aspects  which can be assoc ia ted  w i th  alex icon  (phonology, morphology, syntax i .e .
