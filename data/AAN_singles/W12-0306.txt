Computer writing toolsinclude language technologies, for exampleelectronic dictionaries and text correctionsoftware, as well as information andcommunication technologies, for examplecollaborative platforms and search engines.
Aswe will see, professional writing has becomean entirely computerised activity.
First, wereport on a focus group with professionalwriters, during which they discussed theirexperience using computer tools to writedocuments.
We will describe their practices,point out the most important problems theyencounter, and analyse their needs.
Second, wedescribe LinguisTech, a reference web site forlanguage professionals (translators, writers,language instructors, etc.)
that was launched inCanada in September, 2011.
We comment on apreliminary evaluation that we conducted todetermine if this new platform meetsprofessional writers?
needs.1 IntroductionThis paper focuses on computer writing toolsused during the production of documents, be theyletters, newsletters, policies, guidelines, releasesor annual reports, in a professional setting, whatwe call professional writing (Beaudet, 1998).The importance of professional writing in privateand public organisations is undeniable as writtendocuments serve as communication betweenemployees, support in decision making andorganisational memory.Computer tools can be used in a variety ofwriting situations, such as learning how to writein schools (Kuhn et al, 2009), learning a secondlanguage (Milton and Cheng, 2010), and helpingpeople with cognitive, visual or motor disabilities(Majaranta and Kari-Jouko, 2002).
However, ourknowledge and understanding of computer toolsused by professional writers are somewhatlimited.
Which tools are used by professionalwriters?
Are these tools meeting their needs?
Dowriters know what these tools can do?
Kavanagh(1999) is one of the few authors who investigatedsuch questions.
In his detailed analysis ofMicrosoft Word, he demonstrated that the textprocessor mostly meets formatting and editingneeds, and that it cannot, by far, support everystep of the professional writing process.Kavanagh?s research was quite a revelation at thetime.
However, many years have passed, and wehave seen few studies on that subject since then.Writers have seen their profession evolveover the last 20 years.
First, the massive use ofpersonal computers has transformed writingpractices as writers now have to cope withmachines (computers, printers, scanners) andcomputer tools (text processors, search engines,electronic messaging systems, electronicdictionaries, spelling checkers, and collaborativeplatforms), whose number increases each year.Surely, this computer revolution has simplifiedprofessional writers?
work as computer tools canhelp render more efficient document formatting,proofreading, collaborative writing, and contentreusing, to name just a few examples.
In thatperspective, computer tools should helpprofessional writers produce more documents.However, the number of documents that need tobe produced in today?s society, especially in theservice sector (Nakbi, 2002), is such thatproductivity?s expectations towards writers are39great.
And, as we will discuss in this paper,computer tools are not always well-adapted toprofessional writing.Also, the webification of human knowledge iscreating new expectations in professionalwriters?
skills.
While only a few years ago,documents written according to printingstandards were scanned and published on theweb as images, an increasing number ofdocuments are now produced according tohypertext standards.
Therefore, professionalwriters have to master new specialised skills, forexample in hypertext information organisation,document design, and computer science(Kavanagh, 2006).The goal of this paper is twofold.
First, itreports on an exploratory study on computertools used for the production of writtendocuments in the workplace (see Section 2).
Thisresearch consisted in asking questions toprofessional writers during a focus group.
Wewill present a summary of those discussions andanalyse professional writers?
needs in terms ofcomputer writing tools.
Second, the paperdescribes and analyses LinguisTech, a referenceweb site for language professionals that waslaunched in Canada in September, 2011 (seeSection 3).
This preliminary evaluation willallow us to determine if this new platformactually meets professional writers?
needs.2 Exploratory Study on ComputerTools Used by Professional Writers2.1  Focus GroupA focus group was conducted with volunteers.This method is well suited for exploring subjects,gathering opinions on a specific topic, and askingquestions to participants when more details areneeded.
Participants were met together and couldinteract with each other.
Eight francophoneprofessional writers working in Canada?s capitalregion (Gatineau-Ottawa) participated in ourstudy1.
Our principal selection criteria was thatthe candidates?
main task consisted in writingpractical texts or, at least, that this be the mostimportant part of their job.
The participants hadbetween 3 and 12 years of experience inprofessional writing and came from differentsectors: government and parapublic, enterprise,1 As Geoffrion (1998) explains, the focus group calls for asmall number of participants, preferably between six andtwelve.non-profit organisation, professional associationand print media.Prior to the focus group, it was assumed thatprofessional writing had become an entirelycomputerised activity.
The main objective of thestudy reported in this paper was to gatherinformation on professional writers?
experiencewith computer tools.
We also wanted to exploretheir thoughts on how these tools could bettersupport professional writing in general.
Here is asample of the questions that we asked them.Those questions were addressed to the group, notto individuals.?
In your every day job as a professionalwriter, what computer tools do you use??
For what specific task of the writingprocess do you use those tools??
Do you exclusively use computer tools oralso printed material??
Do you think that using computer toolsimprove your productivity??
Do you have any problems using thosecomputer tools??
How, in your opinion, could computertools better help professional writers??
What other computer tools would youlike to use?We organised two meetings of one and a halfhour each, for a total of three hours.
Themeetings were recorded and transcribed,rendering a 27,000-word text.
This text wasanalysed by identifying all relevant informationon professional writers?
experience withcomputer tools, a step we repeated until we couldnot find any new information.During the focus group, we used the generalexpression computer tool to refer to any toolused to accomplish a task related to professionalwriting.
But as we will see later, this conceptincludes two types of computer tools: languagetechnologies, for example electronic dictionariesand text correction software, and information andcommunication technologies, for examplecollaborative platforms and search engines.2.2 Analytical FrameworkIn order to present results from the focus group,we need a standard procedural model of thewriting process.
We will use Clerc?s model(1998, 2000), which is based on the actualprofessional writers?
practice.
This modelincludes five steps: assignment analysis,information research, information structuring,40writing and revising.
Table 1 gives an overviewof the tasks accomplished at every step of thewriting process.Step 1:Assignmentanalysis?
Meet supervisor or client?
Define mandate?
Establish writing strategyand calendar?
Write a proposal, ifnecessaryStep 2:Informationresearch?

Evaluate writingTable 1.
Tasks done at different steps of the writingprocess in a professional setting (Clerc, 2000)Although this model is in general suited forthe purpose of our research, we needed to makesome adjustments.
First, since none of theparticipants seem to be using computer toolsduring the assignment analysis (in fact, no onebrought this step up during the discussion), weexcluded this step from our analysis.
Second,?Information research?
was renamed?Information research and processing?, whichbetter represents the fact that writers have toprocess (even summarily) the information duringthe research in order to evaluate informationrelevance.
Third, we added the documenttransmission task but, instead of creating a newdistinct step, we included it in the last one of themodel.
This step is thus renamed ?Revising anddocument transmission?.
Table 2 shows asummary of the modified analytical framework.Step 1: Information research and processingStep 2: Information structuringStep 3: WritingStep 4: Revising and document transmissionTable 2.
Modified analytical framework (adaptedfrom Clerc, 2000)2.3 ResultsResults will be presented according to the foursteps of our analytical framework.Information Research and ProcessingMorizio (2006) defines information research asan operation consisting of matching aninformation need and a document.
In the contextof our study, the professional writer formulatesan information need after receiving anassignment from his superior or customer.
Asexpected, most of the documents consulted byour professional writers are in electronic format:files either saved on a drive or available on anetwork (intranet or internet).
Professionalwriters seem to take advantage of what the webhas to offer, consulting newspapers, annualreports, web pages and social networks.Although the content of some of these webdocuments may be questioned (the content of ablog for example), they are still considered as?interesting?
sources, which indicates theprofessional writers?
interest and adaptabilitytowards new forms of electronic information.However, the participants criticised theimmensity of the web, which keeps growing dayafter day.
If we add the fact that many documentsfound on the web are duplicated, and that thesame document can be found in different format(HTML, PDF), this can really slow down theinformation gathering because the writer has toverify if it is in fact the same document.
They donot blame the web for offering too muchinformation, but they wish that this informationbe better organised and easier to find.As we said earlier, professional writerssummarily analyse documents during theinformation gathering, and they save relevantdocuments in personal folders.
We identified twostrategies used by writers to process theinformation at this stage of the writing project2.One of these strategies consists in searching forinformation within documents using the searchengine available in conventional operatingsystems.
Professional writers experienceconsiderable difficulties with this method:?
They have to try many synonyms andlexical variants as search terms, in orderto retrieve all relevant documents.?
Having copied many versions of a samedocument in different folders, processingthe results can be a lot of work because2 Not all participants necessarily use both strategies.41the operating system considers copies ofthe same document as distinctdocuments.?
Still according to the participants of ourstudy, search engines from conventionaloperating systems produce a lot of noise.Those remarks are not original, but theysuggest that professional writers know whichcomputer tools, or which aspects of a particulartool, can slow down their productivity.Conventional operating systems are ubiquitous inorganisations and are relatively user-friendly, sowe can easily understand why our participantsuse them to track documents, but it appears thatthey are not optimal for professional writers, forwhom information research and processing canbe impressive in terms of workload.
Of course,all writers may not classify their documents infolders astutely, a step that would allow for morespecific searches afterwards in individual folders.Second, some writers may not use the advancedfunctions of the search engine correctly.
It wouldbe interesting in further research to study writers?behaviour in-vivo, allowing for more specificrecommendations for document and informationmanagement.
Also, other informationmanagement solutions should be tested in regardto professional writers?
needs.
Could morespecialised tools improve their effectiveness, orat least their satisfaction?The participants described a second strategyfor processing information, which consists incopying and pasting parts of a source document(web page, email, PDF document, etc.)
in a textfile.
More specifically, they create a thematic filein which they paste relevant parts of webdocuments, making sure that they note thesource.
As we know from other computationallinguistics related research such as automaticsummarisation by sentence extraction, thisoperation causes considerable information loss,making it difficult to interpret the informationcorrectly when writing.
In fact, the participantsadmitted that they often have to go back to theoriginal document in order to understand theparts they had copied.
In other words,professional writers need a better strategy toprocess textual electronic information.The copy-and-paste method is alsoproblematic for at least one other aspect: themanipulation of the target document.Professional writers of our study explainedhaving problems organising the parts they copyin the target document, especially when thosefiles contain a considerable amount of pages.Therefore, we understand why some writerschose to create a home-made database (usingExcel or Access) in which they record the nameof the documents they consulted and the topic(s)associated to those documents.
This informationcan then be automatically sorted, for example, bylocation, topic, or name.Information StructuringThe last task before the writing step isinformation structuring.
This is where the writergroups chunks of information and plan theordering.
This plan is generally written using aword processor, and is sometimes createddirectly in the document used to write the text.Surprisingly, none of the interviewed writers usetools such as mind mapping at this stage of thewriting process.WritingWhen it comes to actually writing, participantsuse the traditional language technologiesassociated with the production of professionalwriting, such as text correction software (Word,Antidote 3 ), electronic dictionaries (Le PetitRobert, Le Grand Robert et Collins, WordReference) and terminology data banks(Termium Plus, Le Grand dictionnaireterminologique).
Professional writers use morethan one language technology at once.
Overall,they find these tools useful, an assessment thatshould reassure the language industry, which hasput its focus on developing and promoting thistype of tools in the past years.Revising and Document TransmissionDuring the revising step, professional writers useWord?s advanced functions (track changes andadd comments) and the other languagetechnologies that we already mentioned in theprevious section.
Regarding documenttransmission (or sharing), professional writersfavour web-based file hosting services, eventhough some of them still prefer emails.
We alsoinclude groupware like Google Documents inthis category.
As showed in Adler et al (2006),group writing is a growing practice inprofessional settings, and writers in our studycorroborate this evolution.3 As our participants write French documents, mostlanguage-specific tools that they use are for French textualdata.422.4 General ConclusionsTable 3 presents a summary of computer toolsused for professional writing by the participantsof the focus group.Steps of thewriting processComputer toolsused by writersInformationresearchand processing?

Summary of computer tools used byprofessional writers of the focus groupOur study allows us to draw generalconclusions on the actual practices of Canadianprofessional writers, or even those to come,regarding their use of computer tools.
First, itconfirms that professional writing has become anentirely computerised activity.
In fact, except forthe assignment analysis, step that our participantsdid not address, all tasks related to writing areaccomplished using computer tools.
While sometasks could still be done by hand, for examplereading a document selected during informationresearch or editing a colleague?s documentworking in the same physical environment, thisis not what professional writers choose to do.Only one participant (out of eight) mentionedusing printed dictionaries, but never exclusively.We also know, from this study, thatprofessional writers, at least those weinterviewed, would welcome the integration ofadditional computer tools to their workstation.
Inparticular, they expressed the need for betterinformation and document managementsoftware.
This assessment is quite surprisingconsidering the fact that, as Clerc (2000) notes,the information research can represent more thanhalf of the total time dedicated to one writingproject.
However, although professional writerswould like to use other computer tools in theirwork, they are afraid that they would not knowhow to use them.Professional writers also wish to see otherspecialised tools developed.
For example, theparticipants would use a writing memory systemin contexts where they reuse content such asproducing an annual report.
This idea is certainlynot out of reach.
As a matter of fact, Allen(1999) suggested that the concept of translationmemory be adapted to writing technicaldocuments in a controlled language.
Apreliminary inventory confirms that such toolsstill exist (for example, Author-it, Congree), butwe will have to verify to which extent they couldbe adapted to writing practical texts in general-purpose language.Professional writers have developed specificcomputerised strategies for each task related towritten document production, using the computertools that were available to them.
Considering allthe problems mentioned by the participants, itseems that this piece-by-piece process came tosaturation.
From information research todocument transmission, the steps leading to theproduction of professional documents overlap,which results in the simultaneous presence ofmany computer tools on the writers?
workstation.At the least, the workstation presents a wordprocessor (text that is being written, writing planand other documents that need to be consulted), aweb navigator (with many open windows ortabs), a messaging system, and languagetechnologies.
This clutter of the workstation isnot without consequences.
Professional writersadmitted that the numerous computermanipulations that are necessary to navigatefrom one tool to the other slow down their work,which goes against basic ergonomics.
Inaddition, some writers suggested that themultiplication of computer tools was interferingwith their creativity.
Table 4 summarises themost important problems reported by43professional writers who use computer tools toproduce documents.1.
Conventional operating systems are noteffective to retrieve information or documentson personal computers.2.
Access to more specialised tools such aswriting memory systems is difficult.3.
Desktop is cluttered up with too manycomputer tools and windows.4.
Training on computer tools is needed.Table 4.
Most important problems reported byprofessional writers who use computer tools toproduce documentsIn the next section, we will describeLinguisTech, a new web site dedicated tolanguage professionals (translators, writers,language instructors, etc.
), the first of its kind inCanada.
We conducted a preliminary evaluationin order to determine how useful LinguisTechcould be especially for professional writers.3 Preliminary Evaluation ofLinguisTech3.1 Description of LinguisTechLinguisTech4 was launched in September, 2011.It is developed by the Language TechnologiesResearch Centre (LTRC) and is funded by theGovernment of Canada?s Canadian LanguageSector Enhancement Program.
LTRC describesLinguisTech as a toolbox for languageprofessionals offering language technologies inboth Canadian official languages (French andEnglish), but also as a documentation andtraining centre, as well as a virtual community.We will comment more specifically on theLanguage Technologies Toolbox and on theTraining Center, the two most developed featuresas of today.LinguisTech?s toolbox offers a broadselection of computer tools intended for languageprofessionals (41 in total).
The toolbox includesan inventory of free online tools useful forlanguage-related tasks, as well as a ?virtual?desktop with other information and languagetechnologies.
Computer tools included on thisvirtual desktop can be very expensive, but at themoment, they are available for free to Canadianswho register and further obtain a password.Users can connect from any computer (Mac or4 www.linguistech.caPC), anywhere in the world, and access their ownvirtual computer.
LinguisTech is also adocumentation and training centre wherelanguage professionals can find, among otherresources, tutorials and exercises on how to usecomputer tools (29 in total) 5.Table 5 presents a complete list of computertools, tutorials and exercises presently availablein LinguisTech.

Computer tools, tutorials and exercisesavailable in LinguisTech3.2 AnalysisWe address two research questions: How doesLinguisTech respond to professional writers?needs in terms of computer tools and trainingmaterial?
Can LinguisTech solve any of theproblems mentioned by our participants?
Thispreliminary evaluation of LinguisTech will bepresented according to the four steps of ouranalytical framework.
The analysis is based onthe information obtained from the focus groupdiscussions (see Subsection 2.3).
It is importantto note that LinguisTech did not exist at the timeof the focus group, which was in March, 2011, sothe participants could not have used it prior to thefocus group or mentioned it during thediscussions.Information Research and ProcessingDuring information research and processing,professional writers use many computer tools:web search engines, email services, operatingsystems, text processors, and databases.
As wecan see in Table 5, LinguisTech offers manyuseful tools in regard to this stage of the writingprocess, for example Microsoft Office andWindows, many of which are accompanied by atutorial or an exercise.
Training material is alsoavailable for other tools required at this stage, forexample Google search engine.However, LinguisTech does not offer anytool, tutorial or exercise related to email, aservice largely used by our participants to gatherinformation from colleagues in the workplace.
Aforum where language professionals can shareideas on their profession has been recentlycreated in LinguisTech.
This forum will probablyhelp develop a virtual community, but trainingmaterial on how to effectively use this computertool will be helpful.Also, our participants stated that conventionaloperating systems are not effective to retrieveinformation or documents on personalcomputers, and that more effective informationretrieval systems are needed.
At the moment,LinguisTech does not provide any solution to thisproblem.Information StructuringDuring information structuring, our participantsuse a text processor, which is covered inLinguisTech, both in terms of availability andtraining.WritingWhile putting ideas into words, professionalwriters use a text processor, text correctionsoftware, some dictionaries and terminology databanks.
LinguisTech offers many computer toolsrelated to those tasks, with tutorials andexercises.One of the problems mentioned by ourparticipants was the difficulty to have access tospecialised tools such as writing memorysystems.
As of today, LinguisTech does notinclude any specialised tools of that kind, ortraining material on such tools.Revising and Document TransmissionDuring the last steps of the writing process,professional writers use two additional tools: filehosting services (for example Dropbox) andcollaborative platforms (Google Documents).While those computer tools seem to grow inpopularity among professional writers,LinguisTech does not cover them.
They areneither included in the toolbox, nor is there anytraining material related to them.45As we reported in Subsection 2.4, theprofessional writers?
workstation is cluttered up,meaning that the desktop is busy with many openwindows.
LinguisTech offers many usefulcomputer tools, but no interface (or environment)to integrate them in an ergonomic way.3.3 General ConclusionsIn conclusion, this preliminary evaluation showsthe usefulness of LinguisTech for Canadianprofessional writers, at least those whoparticipated in the focus group.
Most of thecomputer tools they use during the production ofwritten documents are available in LinguisTech.Where LinguisTech falls short is in theintegration of more effective information anddocument management systems and specialisedwriting tools (for example authoring memorysystems).
We do not know how manyprofessional writers use LinguisTech 6 , but wecan imagine that they would expect a ?referenceweb site for language professionals?
to offersome specialised computer tools for tasks relatedto writing in a professional setting7.On the other hand, we have to admit thatLinguisTech?s focus on tutorials and exercisesaddresses concerns expressed in our exploratorystudy, since the absence of training oninformation and language technologies was oneof the major problems mentioned by ourparticipants.Also, we think that LinguisTech could serveas an introduction to new tools, since ourparticipants mentioned that they would welcomethe integration of additional computer tools totheir writing process.
For example, LinguisTechincludes concept mapping tools, which could betested for information structuring, andconcordancers, which could be tested forchecking the correct usage of an expressionduring writing or revising.
Those two categoriesof computer tools are accompanied by trainingmaterial in LinguisTech.4 ConclusionIn this paper, we presented results from a focusgroup with professional writers, in which they6 As a survey on LinguisTech users?
satisfaction will belaunched in March, 2012, we hope to have moreinformation soon on that subject.7 Many resources are available for translation specialisedtasks (see the list of translation and localization tools inTable 5).discussed their experience with computer toolsused to produce documents in the workplace.
Aswe have seen, although they would not be able towork without those tools, they reported a numberof problems, namely that they do not have accessto specialised writing tools, such as authoringmemory systems, and that they need training oncomputer tools.In the second part of the paper, we brieflydescribed LinguisTech, a new platform forlanguage professionals launched last Septemberin Canada.
We concluded that LinguisTech isuseful for professional writers since it givesaccess to many computer tools intended forwriting purposes, and many of those tools areaccompanied by tutorials or exercises.
However,according to our preliminary evaluation,LinguisTech would be even more adapted totoday?s professional writing if it offered moreeffective information and document managementsystems, specialised writing tools, and trainingmaterial on collaborative platforms.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the anonymous reviewersfor their useful comments and suggestions inrevising this paper, and Jo?l Bourgeoys for hisconsiderable help.ReferencesAndy Adler, John C.
