Const ruct ing  a Model of D ia logMare  KOITTar tu  S tate  Un ivers i tyTartu USSRAbst ractIn the present  paper  communicat ive  cyc le(CC) is cons idered  as a d ia log ar is ingbetween two par tners  dur ing so lv ing aproblem.
Communicat ive  s t ra tegy  (C5) isseen as a general  scheme by which a d ia logpar t i c ipant  is guided in ach iev ing his goal.CC is descr ibed in terms of the goals  of thepar t i c ipants  and CS.I, In t roduct ionDia log is a b i la tera l  process  the par ~t i c ipants  of which communicate  each othermessages  concern ing  the sur round ing  world.Each par t i c ipant  in terchang ing ly  under takesthe ro le  of the author  or the rec ip ient .For communicat ion  to be poss ib le  the commu-n icants  must unders tand each other, i.e.%halt  knowledge  of language and about theworld must have a shared part.
Each par t i c i -pant should also know someth ing  about thepar tner  - his goals, knowledge,  poss ib i l i -ties, etc.The task of a d ia log model is a formaldescr ip t ion  of the process  of communicat ionor, in a nar rower  sense, descr ip t ion  of thecommunicat ive  s t ruc ture  of the text  (speech)generated by the communicants  in this pro-cess.
Such descr ip t ion  may be represented,for example,  in the form of a generat ivegrammar  or graph /Rob inson  1982, Metz lng1981/ and it can be rea l i zed  on a computer.One of the aims of work ing out the d ia logmodels  is just to fac i l i ta te  the communica -t ion of man with the computer ,  b r ing ing  itnearer  to man- to -man communicat ion .Next we cons ider  some prob lems ar is ingin s imu la t ing  d ia log interact ion.2.
Communicat ive  cyc le  and communicat ives t ra tegyWe l imit ourse lves  only  to t reat ingsuch d ia logs  where  the communicants  ( let332them be A and B) as co -operat ive  par tnersso lve  some problems.The un i t  o f  s imu la t ion  w i l l  be communi -ca t ive  cyc le  (CC).
We def ine  CC as d ia logar is ing between two par tners  dur ing so lv inga problem.CC cons is ts  of the a l te rnate  tu rn - ta -k ings of the communicants  though not everysuch sequence  forms a CC.
The turns arebui l t  up of communicat ive  acts (CA).
Theminimal  combinat ion  in a CC is a coup le  ort r ip let  of tu rn - tak ings  Of the par t i c ipants(cf.
/ Lang leben 1984/), for example  A: ques-t ion - B: answer, or A: quest ion  - B: answer- A: acceptance  of the answer.
Any CC startswi th set t ing  up a communicat ive  goal by oneof the par t i c ipants  (A).
Let the goal of Abe "B does a deed D'?.
In natura l  communica -t lon ach iev ing  a goal requ i res  more than onecommunicat ive  tu rn - tak ing  f rom both A and B.Typical ly ,  A has some obstac les  in ach iev ingD: e.g.
B does not want to do D; B does notrea l i ze  that not doing D involves negat iveconsequences ;  B th inke  that he is not ableto do D, etc.
For  this reason A must, inadd i t ion  to f ix ing the goal, a lso determinethe resources  he has at his d isposal  forovercoming  these obstac les ,  and the way ofus ing these resources  - i t  means that A mustout l ine  the communicat ive  strategy.Having f i xed  the goal G, A tr ies tod i rect  the re levant  in te l lectua l  and emot io -nal p rocesses  of B (his interests,  assess-ments, op in ions)  dur ing the process  of com-mun icat ion  in such a way as to eventua l lylead B to a dec is ion  to do D. In doing soin f luenc ing the par tner  is ac tua l ly  d i rectedat cer ta in  aspects  of his mind: his  knowled-ge, assumpt ions,  assessments ,  wishes.
Thesere levant  aspects  of the mind of the  par tnermay be cal led his psych ic  parametrss ,  inshort  P -paramstres .
The dec is ion  of B toper fo rm D depends upon the concrete  conf i -gurat ion  of the va lues  of his P -parametresoThe unfavourab ls  va lues  are %he obstac lesment ioned  above.
The essence  of app ly ing a~t~ategy lies in the fac t  that A organizeshis t~iPn-takings to B in such a way thattheir  r~)sult6 will be a change in the valuesof fi~)d P-parametres i n  a required direc-tion: increasing h is  knowledge, changing h isassessm~3nts, increasing his conviction, Pe-ducing or increasing his wishes, and so on.Within ;1 fixed strategy certain P-parametresare  chosen which can be influenced, thedi?ect lon and ways of inf luence (e.go stra-tegies of threa%enlng, scaring, tempting,convinc:Lng~ etc)~ With respect to  the prima-ry comlaunicatlve goal the changing of thevalues of P-parametres may be called "in-strumental goal".The development of the theory of com-municat~ive strategies thus presupposes thedevelopr~ont of a theory of  the P-parametres.I% woui~d be part of a certain qual i tat ivetheory of decls lon-making and should, inaddit ion ?o expl icat ing the system of P-parametres, explain also the inf luence of P-paramet%'es upon the decisions made by aperson.
The factors that must be taken Intoaccoun?
in shaping a decis ion ape numerous.But it turns out  that thls diversity can bereduced to a limited number of p~imary paPa-metres.
We can bring forth the fol lowingtypes of P-parametres: assessments (rationalevaluat ions and those of pleasantness);knowled~e (also skills, experience); into-rests; requirements (wishes, needs, amongthem a need fop communication).Th~ expl icat ion of all possible P-parametl'es requires additional inestlgations(first of all psychological) .
In a model ofdialog the P-parametres of a communicat ivepartner mare up one part of the model ofpartner, During communicat ion some of thesevalues ~tay undergo changes .3.
Simulat ing the communicat ive cycleFirst of all let us descr ibe the pro-cess of formaliz ing the not ion of communica-%ire  s t t ,a tegy  (CS) .CS may be defined as a procedure whichdeformities the  cho ice  o f  an author's com~municat Jve acts.
Th is  choice need not beun ique.
I n  this respect CS differs fromstrategy in the game theory Or from a planof communication.The author A has f i xed  his communlca=t ive str.ategy i f  hei )  \]=as es tab l i shed  the  set  o f  P -parametreso f  the  par tner  B re levant  'to h i s  communi-ca t ive  goa l  Git) knows in case of every relevant P-para-metre whether in order to achieve thegoal G it is necessary to increase or lowerthe required valuei i i )  has determined among the relevant P-parametres one parametre, changing thevalue of which is the Immedla%e goal Gof implementing the  strategyiv) knows in case of every relevant P--para-metre how to change its values eitherdirectly with the help of certain CAs, orindirectly, by changing the values of otherP-parameires.Let us consider one example of CS.
Letthe goal of %he au?hor A of the strategy beG z "B performs a deed D".
(I) The relevant P-parame%res of B:a wish to do Dassessment of posit ive consequences of Dassessment of negative consequences of Dknowledge of the fulf i l lment of theprecondit ions of D,etc .
(2) Let A know that B's wish %o de D islower than required for doing it.
(3 )  Let the P-parametme A wan?s to change beB's wlsh to do D (which needs increasing).This is the immediate goal G i of the stra-tegy.
(4) P-parametres "assossmen?"
and "knowled-ge" can be influenced d~rectly by such com-munlcat ive acts as "giving information","explanation", "substantiation".The P-papametre "wish to do D" can beinfluenced only indirectly, through someother P-parametres, e.g.
bF increasing B'sassessment of posit ive consequences of D, bylowering B's assessment of negative conse-quences of D, by increasing B's knowledgeabout the fulf i l lment of precondit ions of D.The goal G 1 of applying this strategyis to increase B's wish to do D. This mayproceed in di f ferent ways (by  setting upsome subgoals and applying correspondingsuBstrategles):A may increase B's assessment of the posi-t ive consequence of D (by giving informationof them, substant iat ing and explaining),i.e.
to allure, cajole;A can lower B's assessment of negative con~sequences of D (by giving information,555substant ia t ing  and exp la in ing  the i r  bad-heSS), i.e.
to warn, threaten,  scare:A can increase B's ~nowledge  about thefu l f i l lment  of the precond i t ions  of D (e.g.by informing B about the ava i lab i l i t F  ofresources  requ i red  for doing D, exp la in ingit), i.e.
tO convince.The communicat ive  s t ra tegy  does notde?ermine  un ique ly  the way of ach iev ing  agoa l  (the sequence  of communicat ive  acts ofthe par tners )  but leaves the f reedom ofchoice.
Const ruct ing  the next turn dependsamong o iheP th ings upon the changes  whichhave been brought  about in the par tne~?smodel by the in format ion  rece ived  dur ingin terpret ing  the prev ious  tu rn - tak ings  ofthe par tner  ( for eMample,  it may happen %hatsome assumpt ions  of the author  about thepar tner  do not hold).The communicat ive  cyc le  proceeds  asfo l lows (par t i c ipants  A and B, A is thein i t ia tor  of communicat ion ,  G is the com~municat ive  goal of A).In accordance  with specia l  ru les ofinterest  /Saluveer,  e lm 1986/ A f inds the P-parametres  of B re levant  to the goal G. Onthe basis  of the par tner  model A determinesthe necessary  changes  in the values of theseparametres .
Next, A chooses  a re levant  P.-parametre  which va lue needs changing.
In?his way he chooses  his communicat ive  s?ra-tegy the goal G i of which i s  chang ing  theva lue  of the chosen  P -parametr~ (in such a~ay as is ~equ i red  for ach iev ing the goalG).
In case of every  F -pa~ametre  A knowse i ther  the  l ist of CAs or the list of o therP -parame%res  through which i% is poss ib le  toincrease or lower %he va lue of the chosen P~parametre .In order  to ach ieve  the goal G 1 A hasthere fore  e i ther  to choose a CA f rom a given ~list or determlne  a new P -parametre  (which,in its turn, determined  a new communicat ives t ra?egy  which is par% of 'the init ial  CS)and mare up the next turn-ta~ing.Par tner  B whose goal does not needco ins ide  with the goal G determines ,  accor-ding to %he ru les  of interest,  th~ P -pare -metres  of par tne~ A which are re levant  tohis goal.
On the bas is  of the model of A(i.e.
his par tner  model )  B determines  %henecessary  changes  in these pa~ametres .
