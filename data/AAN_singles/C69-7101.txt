ProOect DOC: Its Methodological Basis 1Wil l iam S-Y.
WangI.Dictionary on Computer~ hereafter DOC, is part of anoverall effort to harness an on-line computer for phono-logical research.
For certain problems the linguist findsit necessary to organize large amounts of data, or to per-fo rm rather involved logical tasks -- such as checking outa body of rules with intricate ordering relations.
Inthese situations a computer can be invaluable in that itforces the linguist to think through his problems withgreat precision and in that it can do certain jobs with aspeed and accuracy not otherwise possible.The overt aim of DOC is to reconstruct the phono-logical histories of the major Chinese dialects.
At adeeper level our interest is to find out more about howphonological structures change in  general and the relationbetween these changes and the synchronic systems theylead to.
To achieve these objectives we must attempt toaccount for oceans of data (the regular and irregulardevelopments of thousands of morphemes in dozens of dia-lects).
The hypotheses we posit, i.e., the reconstructedforms and the associated rules~ are likewise numerous andcomplex.
The project is further complicated by the tens-2-of thousands of logographs which must be contended with,especial ly when we involve the rime dictionaries and therime tables.
These considerations lead natural ly to the2 use of a computer in our work.To construct significant ~4vpotheses and to generalizethem beyond the confines of our data pool, to grasp thetheoretical import of each discovery, clearly these arecreative tasks that cannot be mechanized.
Nonetheless a~!ell-hewn tool, such as we hope to develop D0C into, cancontribute substantial ly to facil itate these creativetasks.Of the many language families in the world, Chineseoffers an ideal laboratory within which to study phonolo-gical change for many reasons.
Chief among these are two:(1) its unrivaled wealth of materials, and (2) its dis-t inctive phonology and orthography.
(1) The earliest extant materials date back to ca.1500 B.C.
in the form of oracle inscriptions.
We have avirtual time depth of some three and one-half mil leniaof l iterature.
This l iterature includes not only suchworks as rime tables and rime dictionaries, but alsoextensive contributions from a tradition of philologicalscholarship that arose in the early Son~ and reached con-siderable sophist ication in the Qing period.
Indeed theview has been expressed that in China the mebhods ofscientif ic reasoning were primari ly developed in the hands-3-of the Qing philologists (as opposed to Europe where theyoriginate in the physical sciences).
Few language groupscompare with Chinese with respect to this immense treasureof literature to work with.
(2) By far the greatest bulk of the present knowledgeof phonological change comes from investigations of Indo-European languages.
It is not unlikely, then, that thepresent theories and methods are skewed in the directionof characteristics found in these languages.
Studying alanguage family with a very different structure will helpus balance this skewed perspective.
Indeed Meillet musthave had something like this in mind back in 1913 when, indiscussing the comparative method, he wrote:"Les  rapprochements regoivent des confirmations utilesquand on peut constater que des concordances grammaticaless'ajoutent ~ la concordance du son and du sens .... Leslangues qui, comme les langues indo-europ~enes...ont desparticularit~s grammaticales at tach~es~ certaih mots sepreterit donc mieux ~ la d~monstration de l'~tymologie queles langue o~ tous les  mots se conforment aux m~me r~glesgrammaticales.
La difficult~ qu'on 6prouve ~ poser lagrammaire compar~e de certaines langues, notamment enExtreme-Orient, vient en partie de lg."

32).A language of the Chinese type is distinct in that(a) it has no inflectional paradigms and no morphophonemicalternations to speak of, (b) it has a very simple syllabic-4-structure, (c) it has tones, and (d) its orthography islogographic.
These characteristics all have implicationsfor research on phonological change.
(a) Current views of diachronic phonology invariablyemphasize the importance of paradigmatic analogy as one ofthe two major fonces of phonological change (the othermajor force being phonetic).
The formalization of analogymay be in terms of proportionality in a structuralistframework, or in terms of rule simplification within thecontext of generative phonology.
It would be of consi-derable theoretical interest to examine these views withrespect to Chinese, which has virtually no paradigms.
Inparticular we would want to investigate what are themechanisms whereby a change diffuses lexically 3 in Chinese,where word classes are not related by morphophonemicalternations.
An understanding of these mechanisms iscrucial toward answering the question of whether phonolo-gical change is or is not phonetically actuated.
(b) The simple syllabic structure of the morphemesand the even accentual structure of the sentences are alsoof special interest.
~ereas  many recurrent types of changeoutside of Chinese involve the reduction of consonantclusters into geminates, or the breaking up of clusters byvowel epenthesis, or the reduction of syllabic elements dueto stress shifts, these changes hardly occur at all inChinese.
The pervasive themes found in phonological-5-structures like Chinese are palatalizatibn, dento-labial i -zatien, reduction of post-vocalic obstruents, and variouscomplex interplays between the segmental syllable and tones.Research on phonological change now suffers from asevere lack of a systematic catalog of carefully documentedchanges.
Given that X has the reflex Y, we need to know ifthis change was induced within the system or if it wasactuated by another linguistic system; did X go directlyinto Y or were there intermediate phonemic stages; if eachdirect change was abrupt or gradual, phonetical ly and lexi-cally.
Only when a sufficient fund of such information isavailable can one successfully meet the challenge of pho-netic and other types of explanations, and only then canphonology make the exciting transit ion from a descriptiveeffort into an explanatory science.
DOC i sdes igned to ~facil itate the gathering of this fund of information.The tones of Chinese have intrigued students of lan-guage for many years.
They are of interest to phonologicaltheory because they form a relat ively self-c6ntained sub-system in the sound structure that can serve as a relativelyindependent testing ground for the theory.
The Chinesehave had a categorical (though not physical) understandingof the tones of their language for well over 1500 years.During this period although the morpheme membership of thetonal categories has been relatively stable, the physicalmanifestations of the tones have undergone considerable-6-changes?
Some of these changes, it appears, are intr icatelyconnected to segmental features.
The investigation ofthese changes can contribute much toward our understandingof the inter-relat ionships between phonation and articu-lation.Lastly, the logographic syztem of writ ing has certainunique implications.
Since the logographs are much moredistant ly related to the sounds of the language than arethe alphabets of the European languages, one can assumethat they have exerted very l itt le influence on the develop-ments of the various sound systems.
In other words, wehave fewer cases of historical confusion due to spell ingpronunciat ion to contend with.
By the same token the logo-graphs themselves have an amazing longevity, so that we canmake many inferences about their phonetics for as far backas three thousand years ago.In sum, then, DOC is being developed as a powerfultoo 1 that will give phonological research a speed and pre-cis ion not otherwise attainable.
Its creative use canlead us to a deeper understanding of phonological  structureand change on a quantitat ive basis, at present this toolis being developed within the context of Chinese, for thereasons outl ined in the foregoing paragraphs~ We expectthat the methods we will have worked out will be largelyappl icable to the study of the phonology of any languagegroup.
Indeed, it is to be hoped that a f ield like-7-Indo-European may one day be subjected to the rigors ofthis tool, and its results val idated on a quantitativeand objective basis.II.At present the primary source of data is the HanyuFangyin Zihui.
a The 17 dialects reported in the Zihui arenow available on Linc tape.
Outside of the Zihui, we havethe complete Kan-on, Go-on, Sino-Korean and port ions ofthe Zhongyuan Yinyun.For a variety of reasons, such as ease of tape-punching, ease of proof-reading and error-correction, andease of writ ing of uti l ity programs, the data are storedin several formats.
These formats are related to eachother by a set of supporting programs, as shown in Figure 1.The rectangles indicate data formats and the circles indi-cate supporting programs.The first stage in the data collection is the punchingof paper tape on the teletype.
A standard entry requires24 punches:-8-i.
space2-5.
telegraphic code (G)7. dialect identification (D)8-9. tone (T)10-13. initial (I)14-15. medial (M)16-20. nucleus (N)21. ending (E)22. literary (L)23. carriage return (~)24. line feedi~unches 23 and 24 are discarded by the supporting programRDPT (Read l~aper Tape).
After using RDPT the resultingDialect tape should have the structure illustrated inFigure 2.For proof-reading and error correcting, the Dialecttapes may be converted into File tapes in the format ofLAI ~' 6 ~ as shown in Figure 3.
In this format each entryhas 20 characters (or half-words) which is the maximumnumber that can be displayed per line on the scopel eachentry is further followed by a CASE (Linc code 23) that isdisregarded by FILEDOC and a ~ (Linc code 12) that shiftsthe display to the next line.
So each entry~on the Linctape is still 22 characters or iI words long, even thoughonly 20characters  are displayed.
The spaces (Liuc code 14)are converted into periods (Linc code 20) for ease of reading.-9-LA~ ~ 6 D is modif ied from LAP 6 in two ways.
Theleft margin is moved 4 posit ions to the left so that eachentry will exactly fit one line.
Note space is al lottedfor fi les on both the systems tape and the file tape.According to my present understanding, each dialect tapeis just about the size that a single file can accommodate.The uses of L~ ~ 6 D files are obvious.
We can usethe full set of meta commands for such files as well asthe editing conveniences.The AC tape contains the ~i~-Y~n information for thelogographs as these are recorded in the Zihui , as shown inFigure 4.
The use of this tape makes it possible to addthis information to any dialect tape by matching the tele-graphic codes via the ACCODJ~ program.
The resultant AC-Dialect tape has the structure also shown in Figure 4.Notice that posit ions 17 through 32 correspond to 7 through22 in entry structure of Dialect tape i l lustrated inFigure 2.
As shown in (D) in Figure 4, the number of @ia-lect forms for each entry can be easily increased.Finally, it will be useful for certain problems tohave the result in the form of a se$ of logographs.
Atpresent our computer can only give us the telegraphiccode of the characters.
With LOGOTAB we hope to be ableto display the logographs on the scope and/or print themcut by means of a special purpose computer.
The 16 x 16matrix representations of several thousand logographs have-lO-already been designed by Susumu Kuno's group at theHarvard Computation Laboratory, cf.
Hayashi, et al,1968.
LOGOTAB will be essentially a table look-up pro-gram that will translate telegraphic codes into thosematrix representations.
We are also giving thought toa similar logograph input device as that used by theHarvard group.III.Although the ideas for DOC were first conceived in1966, it is only in late spring 1969 that the project beganto be operational.
Several linguistic programs have beenwritten for it, especially with respect to the sevenMandarin dialects.
In Figure 5 we see a correlation pro-gram that quantifies the development of the Ancient Ghinesetones into each of the Maudarin dialects.
The points ofgreatest interest are of course with the cells which showthe small number of exceptional developments.
Are the~ dueto borrowing from other dialects, residue from changesthat have not yet completed their course, or a~e ~hey dueto the inception of new changes yet to be systematimed~As the data pool becomes richer and richer with theaddition of each new dialect or rime dictionary, it became-ll-increasingly obvious that our little laboratory Lincwould not beab le  to cope with all the problems effi-ciently.
Since the beginning of the summer, Tom McGuireof the Phonology Laboratory has helped us establish aremote terminal that connects to the CDC 6400 in theUniversity Computer Center.
Some of Our materials havealready been converted into magnetic tape that is com-patible with that~computer.

See Lyovin (1968) for a more detailed description ofthe beginnings of Project DOC.3o The hypothesis of lexical diffusion, i.e., phonologicalchange operates gradually across the lexicon is admit-tedly controversial.
The hypothesis would not beacceptable to theorists in the Neogrammarian tradition,e.g., L. Bloomfield.
However, as I argue in Wang (1969),there are good reasons for thinking that this is indeedhow changes are implemented within narrow time spans,i.e., morpheme by morpheme rather than phoneme by pho-neme.
The proof of the hypothesis requires large scalestudies of the sort exemplified by DOC.4.
The Zihui has many draw-backs, as pointed out inLyovin's review (1969).
However, it is obviously thebest set of core materials co start the project on.-21-ReferencesDong, Tong-he.
