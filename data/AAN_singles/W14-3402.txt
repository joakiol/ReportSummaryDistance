Hailu, Natalya Panteleyeva and K. Bretonnel CohenComputational Bioscience Program, University of Colorado DenverSchool of Medicinenegacy.hailu@ucdenver.edu, natalya.panteleyeva@ucdenver.edu,kevin.cohen@gmail.comAbstractIn this paper, we present a system forrecognizing temporal expressions relatedto cell cycle phase (CCP) concepts inbiomedical literature.
We identified 11classes of cell cycle related temporal ex-pressions, for which we made extensionsto TIMEX3, arranging them in an on-tology derived from the Gene Ontology.We annotated 310 abstracts from PubMed.Annotation guidelines were developed,consistent with existing time-related anno-tation guidelines for TimeML.
Two anno-tators participated in the annotation.
Weachieved an inter-annotator agreement of0.79 for an exact span match and 0.82for relaxed constraints.
Our approach isa hybrid of machine learning to recognizetemporal expressions and a rule-based ap-proach to map them to the ontology.
Wetrained a named entity recognizer usingConditional Random Fields (CRF) mod-els.
An off-the-shelf implementation ofthe linear chain CRF model was used.
Weobtained an F-score of 0.77 for temporalexpression recognition.
We achieved 0.79macro-averagee F-score and 0.78 micro-averaged F-score for mapping to the on-tology.1 IntroductionStoring and processing temporal data in biomed-ical informatics is important, but challeng-ing (Zhou and Hripcsak, 2007; Augusto, 2005).Biomedical data is often intrinsically associatedwith time.
For example, data from electronic med-ical records are on a clinical timeline (Zhou andHripcsak, 2007) which links all information on theprogress of a patient?s status.
Temporal reasoningremains a challenge for medical information sys-tems (Combi and Shahar, 1997).
Conventionally,dictionaries define time as ?The continuous pas-sage of existence in which events pass from a stateof potentiality in the future, through the present, toa state of finality in the past?
(Editorial Staff, un-dated).
This traditional linear concept of tempo-rality does not adequately capture the cyclical na-ture of some important biological processes, suchas the cell cycle and circadian rhythms.
In this pa-per, we describe a system for the recognition oftemporal expressions related to cell cycle phasesin biomedical literature.
The cell cycle is a phe-nomenon that a cell goes through during its growthand replication.
Its stages are depicted in Figure 1.We treat each phase as a distinct time componentand we aim at recognizing expressions that de-scribe them in biomedical literature, then mappingthem to an ontology of cell cycle phases and tran-sitions.
Specifically, we are interested in recog-nizing expressions that contain one or more of theconcepts shown in Table 1, where the Gene Ontol-ogy is taken as definitional of concepts related tophases of the cell cycle.Recognition of cell cycle phase concepts fromtext is a non-trivial problem.
Some of the waysthat they can be mentioned in text, such as inter-phase, anaphase, and prophase are relatively un-ambiguous and can be recognized and mapped toan ontology using regular expressions.
However,as is often the case both in general language and inbiomedical language, many of the ways in whichthey can be mentioned are highly ambiguous.
Forexample, M, which stands for mitosis, is often aunit of measurement, as in .

(PMID:23841464).
In addition, the word synthesis is in it-10self ambiguous, even in the context of other men-tions of cell cycle phases.
In the following exam-ples, it refers to something other than a cell cyclephase:?
.
.
.
histone synthesis by lymphocytes in G0and G1.
(PMID: 6849885)?
.
.
.
metaphase-anaphase transition, as a re-sult of fertilization, activation or protein syn-thesis inhibition.
(PMID: 9552372)We treated recognition of temporal expressionsfrom literature as a named entity recognition(NER) problem.
Many approaches to named en-tity recognition are based on machine learningtechniques.
Nadeau and Sekine report that al-though semi-supervised learning algorithms havebeen employed in NER challenges, most systemsthat perform well are built based on supervisedlearning techniques (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007).Based on this survey report, we used ConditionalRandom Fields (CRFs) for the recognition phaseof our approach.
The details of our methods aredescribed in section 4.2.Figure 1: Schematic of the cell cycle.
Outer ring:I = Interphase, M = Mitosis; inner ring: M = Mi-tosis, G1 = Gap 1, G2 = Gap 2, S = Synthesis; notin ring: G0 = Gap 0/Resting [Wikipedia].2 MotivationA vast collection of biomedical literature inPubMed/MEDLINE and other biomedical jour-nal repositories is estimated to grow exponen-tially (Hunter and Cohen, 2006), as shown inFigure 2.
Searching for papers specific toa researcher?s interest in any domain is diffi-cult.
PubMed/MEDLINE allows search usingkeywords, but until recently did not rank results bydocument relevance.
General-purpose search en-gines such as Google and Bing rank their results,but are not well-suited for search of specialized in-formation related to genes and small molecules.Building a specialized search engine exclusivelyto search biomedical literature using genes andsmall molecules as keywords could be very use-ful, for instance, for cancer researchers.Figure 2: Publication growth rate at Med-line (Hunter and Cohen, 2006)Our long term goal is to build a spe-cialized search engine specific to cancer re-search.
The system will retrieve articles fromPubMed/MEDLINE and rank them according totheir relevance.
The system will utilize gene, pro-tein, and small molecule names as keywords indocument search.
We are also interested in identi-fying the phase(s) of the cell cycle during whichthe gene is expressed.
After detecting the ac-tive phase(s) of a gene or gene product, the sys-tem will link relevant documents to this gene fromPubMed/MEDLINE.
In this paper we present ourfirst step towards that goal, which is extraction oftemporal expressions from biomedical literature.Temporal expressions will be used to identify ac-tive phases of genes or gene products.3 Related WorkAutomatic recognition of events and temporal ex-pressions from text has attracted researchers fromareas such as computer science and linguistics.11Concept ID Activities in each phase SynonymsInterphase GO:0051325 The cell readies itself for meiosis or mitosis and thereplication of its DNA occurs.karyostasisG0 phase GO:0044838 Cells enter in response to cues from the cell?s envi-ronment.quiescenceG1 phase GO:0051318 Gap phase -S phase GO:0051320 DNA synthesis takes place.

Definitions from the Gene Ontology.The results have contributed to the developmentof diverse natural language processing applica-tions, such as information extraction, informationretrieval, question-answering systems, text sum-marization, etc.
TimeML: Robust Specification ofEvent and Temporal Expressions in Text (Puste-jovsky et al., 2003) is a specification language forannotation of events and temporal expressions inhuman language.
TimeML addresses specificationissues like time stamping, order of events, reason-ing about events, and time expressions.TempEval is one of the shared challenges in-cluded in SemEval (Agirre et al., 2009) as of 2007.It aims at advancing research on processing tem-poral information.
Primarily it focuses on threetasks: event extraction and classification, temporalexpression extraction and normalization, and tem-poral relation extraction (UzZaman et al., 2013).However, this ongoing work on temporal evalu-ation is based on language data collected fromthe news.
In the clinical domain, (Styler IV etal., Undated; Palmer and Pustejovsky, 2012; Al-bright et al., 2013) describe the THYME annota-tion project.
The scope and language of temporal-ity related to the cell cycle is different from that ofboth TempEval and the clinical domain, and sup-ports (and demands) different types of reasoning,specifically related to cyclical time.Cyclical phenomena are ubiquitous in can-cer development and progression.
The connec-tion between the cell cycle and cancer is wellknown (Vermeulen et al., 2003; Kastan andBartek, 2004; Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009),and the fact that the cell cycle is the main targetfor cancer regulation, deregulation, and therapyis well established (Vermeulen et al., 2003; Kas-tan and Bartek, 2004; Malumbres and Barbacid,2009).
Circadian rhythms, rounds of chemother-apy, remissions, and re-occurrences all have acyclic nature.Circadian rhythms have been inves-tigated in the study of cancer treatment (Sahar andSassone-Corsi, 2009; Ortiz-Tudela et al., 2013;Lengyel et al., 2009; Kelleher et al., 2014).From the perspective of cancer research, identi-fying cell cycle concepts in the literature is crucialto being able to retrieve and explore informationrelated to cyclical biological processes like the celllife cycle.
From the natural language processingperspective, the novelty of this work consists inmodeling cyclical time.
To our knowledge, tempo-ral event recognition grounded in a cyclical modelof time has not been previously proposed.4 Methodology4.1 MaterialsWe built a corpus of 360 abstracts, consisting of70,570 words.
The concepts are presented in Ta-ble 1.
We balanced our corpus by collecting arti-cles from the PubMed/MEDLINE database usingthe concepts individually as keywords.
We used12the PubMed/MEDLINE1and BioMedLib searchengines2, two keyword-based search engines builton top of MEDLINE, for this purpose.
The fol-lowing keywords were used to collect the abstractsfrom PubMed and BioMedLib:?
interphase, G0, G0 phase, G1, G1 phase, syn-thesis, S phase, G2, G2 phase?
Mitosis, M phase, prophase, metaphase,anaphase, telophase?
checkpointThe annotation guidelines addressed the follow-ing issues:?
The goal of the project: the goal of the anno-tation project was to develop a highly anno-tated corpus specific to CCP concepts, whichwill be used for automatic recognition andclassification.?
Specification of each tag: this is shown inFigure 3.?
Tool used to annotate the project: We usedKnowtator (Ogren, 2006), a text annotationtool built on top of the Prot?eg?e knowledgerepresentation system.Modeling the phenomenon was the first step inunderstanding the annotation process (Pustejovskyand Stubbs, 2012).
We modeled our corpus as atriple, Model = <T, R, I>, as shown below:?
Model = <T, R, I> where T = terms, R = re-lation between the terms, and I = interaction?
T = {Named Entity, time expression, not timeexpression}?
R = {Named Entity ::= TIMEXCCP | notTIMEXCCP}?
I = {TIMEXCCP = list of concepts from Ta-ble 1 or checkpoints.
Examples of check-points are G1/G2 phase, S/G2 phase, etc.TimeML is a specification for annotating hu-man language in text (Pustejovsky et al., 2003).TIMEX3 is defined in TimeML as a tag for cap-turing dates, times, durations, and sets of dates and1http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2http://bmlsearch.com/times.
In our work we extended TIMEX3.
We em-ploy a single tag set called TIMEXCCP, where thenaming is intended to be consistent with existingtime-related tag sets.
Figure 3 shows the attributesand functions of the tag TIMEXCCP, as well asexamples of usage.Figure 3: Attributes and functions of the TIMEX-CCP tag.Two annotators with training in the domain per-formed the annotation.
Inter-annotator agreementwas calculated as F-measure, following (Hripcsakand Rothschild, 2005).
Inter-annotator agreementwas 0.79 for an exact-span match and 0.82 for re-laxed matching.
The constraints, which are valuesof the attributes, were not considered while com-puting IAA for the latter case.The annotation effort developed through sev-eral iterations, applying the annotation devel-opment cycle introduced by Pustejovsky andStubbs (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012).
Thismethodology is depicted in Figure 4.
It is calledthe MATTER cycle, which stands for Model, An-notation, Train, Test, Evaluation, Revise.
The ad-vantage of this methodology is that it allows usto discover hidden specifications and refine themduring the MATTER cycle.4.2 MethodsWe are particularly interested in recognizing andclassifying temporal expressions in the literature.For example, in the following sentence, taken fromWikipedia, the recognition task is to recognize theblue boxes as shown below and classify them.
Themapping task is to categorize the recognized tem-poral expressions into the concepts shown in Ta-ble 1.
"Microhomology-mediated endjoining (MMEJ) uses a Kuprotein and DNA-PK independentrepair mechanism, and13Figure 4: The MATTER cycle (Pustejovsky andStubbs, 2012)repair occurs during theS phase of the cell cycle,as oposed to the G0/G1 andearly S phases in NHEJ andlate S to G2 phases in HR."...
the S phase of the cell cycle, as opposedto the G0/G1 and early S phases in NHEJ andlate S to G2 phase in HR.In this example, there are four temporal expres-sions: S, G0/G1, early S, and late S to G2.
Theexpression ?S?
is of the type S-phase or synthesisphase according to the conceptual ontology inTable 1.
The expression ?G0/G1?
can be classifiedas G0 and G1.
Similarly, the expression ?late S toG2?
can be of type S and G2.Our approach is a hybrid of machine learningand rule-based techniques.
The machine learningtechnique, which we refer to as the first layer, isapplied for temporal expression recognition.
Inthis layer, CRFs are trained to learn to recognizethe expressions from the list of features which isshown below.1.
Word-level features:?
Is the word in uppercase??
Is the first character of the word in up-percase??
Words themselves are also treated asfeatures.?
Length of the word.2.
Punctuation-related features:?
Does the word contain at least one of themost common punctuation marks?3.
Digit-related features:?
Is the word a digit??
Does the word contain a digit?4.
Does the word contain either of the follow-ing: phase, arrest, entry?
These words typi-cally come before or after the cell cycle con-cepts.
For example, early mitosis, G0 phase.5.
Part-of-Speech tagging: Window size of 2before and after the word.6.
Presence of concept modifiers before theword.
Modifiers include: early, mid, late,early-mid.Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are one ofthe probabilistic graphical model sequence tag-ging techniques.
They are understood as a sequen-tial version of Maximum Entropy Models (Klingerand Tomanek, 2007).
One advantage of CRFs overother probabilistic models like Hidden MarkovModels and Maximum Entropy Models for com-plex systems is their support for features interact-ing with one another.
The linear chain CRF repre-sentation is shown in Figure 5.Figure 5: A linear chain Conditional Ran-dom Field representation (Klinger and Tomanek,2007).In this representation, ~x is a vector of observa-tions, also known as features in machine learn-ing, and the yt?s are states or labels.
In this lin-ear chain model, a given state is dependent on itsprevious, current, and next states.
It is also in-fluenced by the observations for that state.
Thisargument can be formulated as Equation 1.
Ac-cordingly, state prediction will be an optimizationof Equation 1.
?c(~x, ~y) are the factor matrices of14the maximal cliques read from the factor graph inFigure 5 (Klinger and Tomanek, 2007).P (~y|~x) =1Z(~x)?cC?c(~x, ~y) (1)We used the IOB format, which is the most com-mon method of representation for sequence tag-ging.
In this format, I stands for the inside, O isthe outside, and B is the beginning of a temporalexpression.

Therules match simple cell cycle phase concepts.
Forexample, the phrase early S phase is classified assynthesis, since there is S in it.
The expressionG0/G1 phase is classified as a G0/G1 checkpoint.5 Experimental setupWe split our dataset of more than 70K tokens into80% training and 20% test sets.
We used 5-foldcross validation to balance the distribution of thedataset.
The number of positive instances for the5 runs is shown in Figure 6.
The expressionsS and synthesis are displayed separately, despitetheir identical meaning, to allow for more granu-lar evaluation of performance.
The same rationaleapplies to displaying M and mitosis separately.The ratio of the individual concepts that wehave in the 5 runs is balanced, as shown in Fig-ure 6.
However, the training dataset is skewed,since there are almost 98% negative labels, withthe remaining small portion as positive labels.Among the approximately 10K test tokens, 180of them are labeled as positive TIMEXCCP, butthe others are negative, i.e.
they have the labelO.
A positive TIMEXCCP in this case could beB TIMEXCCP or I TIMEXCCP?beginning orinside of a temporal expression.,6 ResultsSince the task consisted of two separate steps?temporal expression recognition, and mapping ornormalization?in this section, we report our find-ings independently.
Our evaluation metrics are interms of precision P, recall R, and F-measure.
Thesystem achieved precision P = 0.83, recall R =0.72 and F = 0.77 for recognizing TIMEXCCP inbiomedical literature.The temporal expression mapper, which is arule-based system, achieved a macro-averaged P=0.90, R = 0.70, and F = 0.79 and a micro-averagedP = 0.86, R = 0.71, and F = 0.78.
The system per-formance for the individual concepts is shown inFigure 7.7 DiscussionSome of the false positive predictions were due tohuman annotation errors.There were some conditions where the annota-tors disagreed.
For example, .
.
.
early G1 to G2phase.
This examples addresses two questions thatshould be explicitly mentioned in the annotationguidelines:?
Does the modifier ?early?
modify only G1, orboth G1 and G2??
Should there be an attribute for the range oftime from G1 to G2 in the annotation guide-lines?Our system achieved good performance onboth time expression recognition and mapping ofhighly ambiguous concepts.
In spite of the chal-lenges presented by ambiguity, we obtained 0.85,0.81, and 0.80 F-measures for recognizing andmapping the concepts synthesis, M, and S, respec-tively.
The most informative features that con-tribute to this score are the discriminating wordsbefore and after a target token.
These words are:phase, arrest, and entry.
They are often presentbefore or after CCP concepts.
Also, presence ofmodifiers is a good indication of CCP concepts.For example, in the phase early S phase, the mod-ifier early is one of the most informative features.However, recognition of complex phrases as inlate S to G2 phase remained a challenge.The challenges of complex temporal expres-sions can be seen from a different perspective.15Figure 6: Distribution of concepts in 5 runs.Figure 7: Rule-based classification performance.
Average score for 5 runs.Mostly the system recognizes the individual con-cepts within a complex phrase, but not the mod-ifiers nor the words like prepositions within thecomplex phrase.
In the example given previously,the system recognizes S and G2 but not the modi-fier late, nor the preposition to.
These challengescould be tackled by having features that addressthe modifiers as well as words within two con-cepts.We used a naive tokenizer that splits the textinto words based on white space.
In the future,we would like to test the system with other moresophisticated tokenizers.
We kept punctuationmarks in temporal expressions, for example, theforward slash in G0/G1 phase.
Presence of punc-tuation marks, such as hyphen (-), forward slash(/), comma (,) and single quote (?
), within a tokenis one of our features in training the machine learn-ing algorithm to recognize temporal expressions.8 Conclusions & Future workCell cycle phase concepts are time expressions,and can be annotated in a fashion similar toTimeML.
In this work, we annotated a corpus withcell cycle phase information.
This corpus can beused to train machine learning algorithms to pre-dict cell cycle phase concepts.
The concepts wereannotated using the TIMEXCCP tag, an extensionof TIMEX3, which has the following attributes:value, modifier, set, and comments.
The detailsare in Figure 3.We have developed a temporal expression rec-ognizer and classifier based on a hybrid of ma-chine learning and rule-based techniques.
We pro-pose a two-tiered architecture to solve temporalexpression recognition and mapping for CCP con-cepts.
The first tier recognizes temporal expres-sions using CRFs.
In the second tier, a rule-basedsystem classifies the concepts.Some of the main future directions for thisworks are testing the system with the addition ofmore annotated data.
We will focus on how wecan capture complex time expressions.
This mighttake us to redefining the annotation guidelines thatwe have right now.16AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Richard Osborne and ScottCramer for helpful discussion of the significanceof this work from a cancer research perspective.ReferencesEneko Agirre, Llu?
