Proceedings of the EACL 2012 Student Research Workshop, pages 32?37,Avignon, France, 26 April 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsManually Constructed Context-Free GrammarFor Myanmar Syllable StructureTin Htay HlaingNagaoka University of TechnologyNagaoka, JAPANtinhtayhlaing@gmail.comAbstractMyanmar language and script are unique andcomplex.
Up to our knowledge, considerableamount of work has not yet been done indescribing Myanmar script using formal languagetheory.
This paper presents manually constructedcontext free grammar (CFG) with ?111?productions to describe the Myanmar SyllableStructure.
We make our CFG in conformity withthe properties of LL(1) grammar so that we canapply conventional parsing technique calledpredictive top-down parsing to identify Myanmarsyllables.
We present Myanmar syllable structureaccording to orthographic rules.
We also discussthe preprocessing step called contraction forvowels and consonant conjuncts.
We make LL (1)grammar in which ?1?
does not mean exactly onecharacter of lookahead for parsing because of theabove mentioned contracted forms.
We use fivebasic sub syllabic elements to construct CFG andfound that all possible syllable combinations inMyanmar Orthography can be parsed correctlyusing the proposed grammar.1 IntroductionFormal Language Theory is a common way torepresent grammatical structures of naturallanguages and programming languages.
Theorigin of grammar hierarchy is the pioneeringwork of Noam Chomsky (Noam Chomsky,1957).
A huge amount of work has been done inNatural Language Processing where Chomsky`sgrammar is used to describe the grammaticalrules of natural languages.
However, formulationrules have not been established for grammar forMyanmar script.
The long term goal of this studyis to develop automatic syllabification ofMyanmar polysyllabic words using regulargrammar and/or finite state methods so thatsyllabified strings can be used for Myanmarsorting.In this paper, as a preliminary stage, we describethe structure of a Myanmar syllable in context-free grammar and parse the syllables usingpredictive top-down parsing technique todetermine whether a given syllable can berecognized by the proposed grammar or not.Further, the constructed grammar includeslinguistic information and follows the traditionalwriting system of Myanmar script.2 Myanmar ScriptMyanmar is a syllabic script and also one of thelanguages which have complex orthographicstructures.
Myanmar words are formed bycollection of syllables and each syllable maycontain up to seven different sub syllabicelements.
Again, each component group has itsown members having specific order.Basically, Myanmar script has 33 consonants, 8vowels (free standing and attached)1 , 2 diacritics,11 medials, a vowel killer or ASAT, 10 digitsand 2 punctuation marks.A Myanmar syllable consists of 7 differentcomponents in Backus Normal Form (BNF) is asfollows.S:= C{M}{V}[CK][D] | I[CK] | NwhereS   = Syllable1.
C  = Consonant2.
M = Medial or Consonant Conjunct orattached consonant1 Free standing vowel syllables (eg.
?
)and attached vowelsymbols (eg.
)323.
V = Attached Vowel4.
K = Vowel Killer or ASAT5.
D = Diacritic6.
I  = Free standing Vowel7.
N =  DigitAnd the notation [ ] means 0 or 1 occurrence and{ } means 0 or more occurrence.However, in this paper, we ignore digits, freestanding vowel and punctuation marks in writinggrammar for Myanmar syllable and we focusonly on basic and major five sub syllabic groupsnamely consonants(C), medial(M), attachedvowels(V), a vowel killer (K) and diacritics(D).The following subsection will give the details ofeach sub syllabic group.2.1 Brief Description of Basic MyanmarSub Syllabic ElementsEach Myanmar consonant has default vowelsound and itself works as a syllable.

having 33 elements.
But, the letter ?
can actas consonant as well as free standing vowel.Medials or consonant conjuncts mean themodifiers of the syllables` vowel and they areencoded separately in the Unicode encoding.There are four basic medials in Unicode chartand it is represented as the set M={    ,   ,   }.The set V of Myanmar attached vowel charactersin Unicode contains 8 elements { ?,  ,  ,  ,  ,, ,  }.
( Peter and William, 1996)Diacritics alter the vowel sounds ofaccompanying consonants and they are used toindicate tone level.
There are 2 diacritical marks{  ,   } in Myanmar script and the set isrepresented as D.The asat, or  killer, representing the set K= {   }is a visibly displayed sign.
In some cases itindicates that the inherent vowel sound of aconsonant letter is suppressed.
In other cases itcombines with other characters to form a vowelletter.
Regardless of its function, this visible signis always represented by the character U+103A .2[John Okell, 1994]In Unicode chart, the diacritics group D and thevowel killer or ASAT ?K?
are included in thegroup named various signs.2.2  Preprocessing of Texts - ContractionIn writing formal grammar for a Myanmarsyllable, there are some cases where two or moreMyanmar characters combine each other and theresulting combined forms are also used inMyanmar traditional writing system though theyare not coded directly in the Myanmar Unicodechart.
Such combinations of vowel and medialsare described in detail below.Two or more Myanmar attached vowels arecombined and formed new three members {  ,,     } in the vowel set.Glyph Unicode forContractionDescription+  1031+102C Vowel sign E+ AA+1031+102C+103AVowel sign E+AA+ASAT+   102D + 102F Vowel sign I+ UU?Table 1.
Contractions of vowels?Similarly, 4 basic Myanmar medials combineeach other in some different ways and producenew set of medials {  ,   ,   ,   ,    ,,       }.

List of vowels and Medials?2.3 Combinations of Syllabic Componentswithin a SyllableAs mentioned in the earlier sections, we chooseonly 5 basic sub syllabic components namelyconsonants (C), medial (M), attached vowels (V),vowel killer (K) and diacritics (D) to describeMyanmar syllable.
As our intended use forsyllabification is for sorting, we omit stand-alonevowels and digits in describing Myanmarsyllable structure.
Further, according to thesorting order of Myanmar Orthography, stand-alone vowels are sorted as the syllable using theabove 5 sub syllabic elements having the samepronunciation.
For example, stand-alone vowel???
is sorted as consonant ???
and attachedvowel ?
?
combination as  ??
?.3 Sorting order of Medials and attached vowels in MyanmarOrthographyIn Myanmar language, a syllable with only oneconsonant can be taken as one syllable becauseMyanmar script is Abugida which means allletters have inherent vowel.
And, consonants canbe followed by vowels, consonant, vowel killerand medials in different combinations.One special feature is that if there are twoconsonants in a given syllable, the secondconsonant must be followed by vowel killer (K).We found that 1872 combinations of sub-syllabicelements in Myanmar Orthography [MyanmarLanguage Commission, 2006].
The table belowshows top level combinations of these sub-syllabic elements.Conso-nantonlyConsona-ntfollowedby VowelConsona-ntfollowedbyConsona-ntConsonantfollowed byMedialC CV CCK CMCVCK CCKD CMVCVD  CMVDCVCKD  CMVCKCMVCKDCMCKCMCKD?Table 4.
Possible Combinations within a Syllable?The combinations among five basic sub syllabiccomponents can also be described using FiniteState Automaton.
We also find that Myanmarorthographic syllable structure can be describedin regular grammar.

and wefound that the director symbol sets (which is alsoknown as first and follow sets) for same non-terminal symbols with different productions aredisjoint.This is the property of LL(1) grammar whichmeans for each non terminal that appears on theleft side of more than one production, thedirectory symbol sets of all the productions inwhich it appears on the left side are disjoint.Therefore, our proposed grammar can be said asLL(1) grammar.The term LL1 is made up as follows.
The first Lmeans reading from Left to right, the second Lmeans using Leftmost derivations, and the ?1?means with one symbol of lookahead.

Parsing a Myanmar Syllable usingpredictive top-down parsing method?4 ConclusionThis study shows the powerfulness ofChomsky`s context free grammar as it can applynot only to describe the sentence structure butalso the syllable structure of an Asian script,Myanmar.
Though the number of productions inthe proposed grammar for Myanmar syllable islarge, the syntactic structure of a Myanmarsyllable is correctly recognized and the grammaris not ambiguous.Further, in parsing Myanmar syllable, it isnecessary to do preprocessing called contractionfor input sequences of vowels and consonantconjuncts or medials to meet the requirements oftraditional writing systems.
However, because ofthese contracted forms, single lookahead symbolin our proposed LL(1) grammar does not referexactly to one character and it may be acombination of two or more characters in parsingMyanmar syllable.5 Discussion and Future WorkMyanmar script is syllabic as well asaggulutinative script.
Every Myanmar word orsentence is composed of series of individualsyllables.
Thus, it is critical to have efficient wayof recognizing syllables in conformity with therules of Myanmar traditional writing system.Our intended research is the automaticsyllabification of Myanmar polysyllabic wordsusing formal language theory.One option to do is to modify our current CFG torecognize consecutive syllables as a first step.We found that if the current CFG is changed forsequence of syllables, the grammar can be nolonger LL(1).
Then, we need to use one of thestatistical methods, for example, probabilisticCFG, to choose correct productions or best parsefor finding syllable boundaries.Again, it is necessary to calculate the probabilityvalues for each production based on thefrequency of occurrence of a syllable in adictionary we referred or using TreeBank.We need Myanmar corpus or a tree bank whichcontains evidence for rule expansions for syllablestructure and such a resource does not yet existfor Myanmar.
And also, the time and cost forconstructing a corpus by ourselves came intoconsideration.Another approach is to construct finite statetransducer for automatic syllabification ofMyanmar words.
If we choose this approach, wefirstly need to construct regular grammar torecognize Myanmar syllables.
We already haveMyanmar syllable structure in regular grammar.However, for finite state syllabification usingweights, there is a lack of resource for trainingdatabase.We still have many language specific issues to beaddressed for implementing Myanmar scriptusing CFG or FSA.
As a first issue, our currentgrammar is based on five basic sub-syllabicelements and thus developing the grammarwhich can handle all seven Myanmar subsyllabic elements will be future study.Our current grammar is based on the code pointvalues of the input syllables or words.
Then, as asecond issue, we need to consider about differentpresentations or code point values of samecharacter.
Moreover, we have special writingtraditions for some characters, for example, such36as consonant stacking eg.
?
??
Buddha), ???
(Mandalay, second capital of Myanmar),consonant repetition eg.
?
(University),kinzi eg.
?io   (Cement), loan words eg.?
v  (bus).
To represent such complex formsin a computer system, we use invisible Viramasign (U+1039).
Therefore, it is necessary toconstruct the productions which have conformitywith the stored character code sequence ofMyanmar Language.ReferencesJohn Okell.
