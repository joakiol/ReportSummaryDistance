The intended sizeof the corpus is  one billion (109) tokens and assuch, at the time of completion in 2010, the NCPis  going  to  be  one  of  the  largest  corporaavailable,  possibly  the  largest  corpus  featuringmultiple levels of linguistic annotation of variouskinds.
Currently,  a  hand-verified  one-million-token subcorpus is being completed, and a basic,automatically created 430-million-token demo isavailable online at http://nkjp.pl/.The project uses an extended morphosyntactictagset with several years of practical use behindit  in  one  of  the  source  corpora  (cf.http://korpus.pl/)  and an open-source query en-gine with a powerful, regex-based language anda graphical front-end.Section  2  of  this  paper  talks  about  theencoding format adopted for the corpus, section1 The  Polish  name  of  the  corpus  is  Narodowy  KorpusJ?zyka  Polskiego,  hence  the  abbreviation  NKJP,  used  inweb addresses and namespace identifiers.3 presents its general architecture, and section 4discusses  the  reasons  for,  and  our  implemen-tation  of,  the  suggested  NCP  enhancements  tothe TEI Guidelines.2 The encoding format: stand-off TEIThe Text Encoding Initiative (TEI Consortium,2007) has been at the forefront of text annotationand resource interchange for many years.
It hasinfluenced corpus linguistic practices in at leastthree related ways.
Firstly,  the formalism itself,in the mature  form,  has been used to  mark  uplinguistic  corpora,  e.g.
the  British  NationalCorpus.
An  early  application  of  the  TEI,  theCorpus  Encoding  Standard  (CES;  seehttp://www.cs.vassar.edu/CES/), together with itsXML  version,  XCES  (http://www.xces.org/),have served as de facto standards for corpus en-coding  in  numerous  projects.
Finally,  the  ex-perience gained in creating and using XCES (to-gether with e.g.
the feature-structure markup ofthe TEI) has served as a foundation for the Lin-guistic  Annotation  Format  (LAF,  Ide  and  Ro-mary, 2007), within ISO TC37 SC4.
LAF pro-mises to provide a standard interchange formatfor  linguistic  resources  of  many  diverse  kindsand origins.The relationship between the TEI (especiallyin its stand-off version) and the LAF is straight-forward.
Both are implemented in XML, whichmakes transduction between a rigorous TEI for-mat and the LAF ?dump?
(pivot) format mostly amatter of fleshing out some data structures.3 NCP ?
general architectureStand-off annotation is by now a well-groundeddata representation technique,  pioneered by theCES and continuing to be the foundation of theLAF.
In short, it assumes that the source text inthe corpus, ideally kept in an unannotated formand in read-only files,  is the root of a possiblymulti-file  system  of  data  descriptions  (eachdescription focusing on a distinct aspect of the64source data).
The source text is typically accom-panied by a level of primary segmentation, whichmay  be  the  lowest-level  XML  layer  of  anno-tation.
The  other  files  form  a  possibly  multi-leaved  and  multi-leveled  hierarchy  referencingeither  the  level  of  primary  segmentation,  orhigher  order  levels  of  description.
The  NCPfollows these guidelines to the extent allowed bythe TEI schema.Each corpus text is kept in a separate directorytogether with the annotation files that reference itdirectly or indirectly, and with the header that isincluded  by  all  these  files.
Contents  of  anexample directory are shown below.
(1) text.xmlheader.xmlann_morphosyntax.xmlann_segmentation.xmlann_structure.xmlAll of these files contain TEI documents (or, inthe case of header.xml, proper subsets thereof).They form a  hierarchy of  annotation levels,  aspresented  in  Figure  1.
The  text.xml  file  is  theroot,  referenced  by  the  layer  of  text  structure(providing  markup  from  the  paragraph  levelupwards)  and  the  layer  of  segmentation.
Thesegmentation layer  is  further referenced by thelayer of morphosyntactic information and word-sense annotation.
The morphosyntactic level, inturn,  is  the  basis  for  the  level  identifying  syn-tactic  words,  which  constitutes  the  foundationupon  which  the  levels  identifying  syntacticchunks and named entities are built.In  text.xml,  the  normalized  source  text  isdivided in paragraph-sized chunks (enclosed inanonymous blocks, <ab>, to be further refined inthe  text-structure  level  of  annotation).2 It  also2 Ideally,  as mentioned above,  the primary text should bestored without markup, and the segmentation layer shouldconstitute the lowest-level XML document.
This is exactlyincludes  two  headers:  the  main  corpus  header,which encodes information relevant to all  partsof  the  corpus,  and  the  local  header,  whichrecords the information on the particular text andits annotations.The segmentation file provides what the LAFcalls the base segmentation level that is furtherused as the basis for other kinds of annotation.
Itis implemented as a TEI document with <seg>elements that contain XInclude instructions (seeexample (4) in the next section).
As such, it mayserve both as a separate annotation layer or as amerged  structure,  after  the  inclusion  directivesare resolved.
Crucially, in the latter case, whichis  the  default  with  many parsers,  the  XPointerindexing information is lost.
We shall come backto this issue in section 4.1.The text-structure layer is defined similarly tothe segmentation layer.
Other annotation layersreplace the mechanism of XInclude with XLink,in the way advocated by the XCES.The morphosyntactic layer of annotation con-sists of a series of <seg> elements that containTEI feature structures (i) providing basic infor-mation on the segment,  (ii)  specifying the pos-sible interpretations as identified by the morpho-logical analyser, and (iii) pointing at the morpho-what  the  LAF-encoded  American  National  Corpus  does,requiring dedicated tools for merging plain text corpus fileswith  the  segmentation  documents.
Unfortunately,  this  iswhere we reach the technological boundary of the XIncludesystem: it is unable to reference substrings in a plain textfile,  due  to  a  weakly  motivated  ban  on  the  concurrentpresence  of  @parse=?text?
attribute  and  the  @xpointerattribute.
We  therefore  enclose  the  source  text  in  ano-nymous  blocks  (<ab>)  that  we  can  easily  address  withXPointers.
An anonymous reviewer agrees that the lack of asingle,  immutable  text  file  is  a  serious  weakness  of  thissystem and notes that being able to derive plain text frommarkup is no remedy.
This may constitute either a case forXLink, or an argument for lifting the @parse/@pointer ban.Figure 1: The logical data structure of the NCP65syntactic  description  selected  by  the  disambi-guating agent.The  higher-order  annotation  layers  alsocontain feature structures, which usually point atthe  selected segments  of  annotation layers  thatare one level  lower, and identify their  functionwithin the given data structure.4 Enhancements  to  the  TEI  stand-offrecommendationsIn this section, we first illustrate a case where thestand-off annotation system as advocated by theTEI  loses  information  on  the  boundedness  ofsegments,  and  then  move  on  to  illustrate  adifferent  issue  stemming  from  the  lack  of  aneutral bracket-like element in the TEI markup.4.1 Identification of bound segmentsSegmentation  of  Polish  texts  is  not  a  trivialmatter,  partially  because  of  the  person-numberenclitics ?
elements that can attach to almost anypart  of  the  clause,  while  being  functionallyrelated to  the  main  verb.
Segmenting them to-gether  with  their  hosts,  apart  from  being  amethodologically  bad  move,  would  greatly  in-crease the complexity of  the linguistic analysisbuilt on top of such segmentations.
The diamondin  (2)  below marks  alternative  positions  wherethe  2nd Person  Plural  clitic  (separated  by  avertical  bar)  may  appear.
All  of  the  resultingsentences have the same interpretation.

?yellow and red fabric?Inline markup of the above examples preservesinformation on which segment is bound (attachedto  the  preceding  one)  or  free-standing.
This  isdue  to  the  whitespace  intervening  between the<seg> elements in this kind of markup.When,  however,  stand-off  markup  using  theXInclude  mechanism  is  applied  here,  com-plications  arise.
The  segmental  level  of  anno-tation with unresolved inclusions provides clearhints about the status of segments.
This is due toXPointer  offsets,  as  can be seen  in  (4)  below,which is an example assuming that the adjective??
?to-czerwony is the first word in an <ab> ele-ment bearing the @xml:id attribute set to ?t1?.3(4)<seg xml:id="segm_1.1-seg"><xi:include href="text.xml"xpointer="string-range(t1,0,5)"/></seg><seg xml:id="segm_1.2-seg"><xi:include href="text.xml"xpointer="string-range(t1,5,1)"/></seg><seg xml:id="segm_1.3-seg"><xi:include href="text.xml"xpointer="string-range(t1,6,8)"/></seg>However, after inclusions are resolved, all of theoffset  information  is  lost,  because  all  the@xpointer attributes (indeed, all the <xi:include>elements)  are  gone  and  all  that  remains  is  asequence  of  <seg>  elements  such  as<seg>??
?to</seg><seg>-</seg><seg>czerwony</seg>.While, in many cases, information on bound-edness  could  be  recovered  from  the  morpho-syntactic description of the given segment,  thisdoes not resolve the issue because, firstly, a re-course  to  morphosyntactic  annotation  layer  inorder to recover information lost in the segmen-tation layer is methodologically flawed (in somecases, it is perfectly imaginable that a text is onlyaccompanied by the segmentation layer of anno-tation and nothing else), and, secondly, morpho-syntactic identity will not resolve all such cases.Consider the example of ??
?to-czerwony ?yellowand red?
: the segment  czerwony here is bound,but  both  graphically  and  morphosyntacticallyidentical  to  the  frequent  free-standing  segmentczerwony ?red?.In order to accommodate such cases, we havedefined  an  additional  attribute  of  the  <seg>element,  @nkjp:nps,  where  ?nkjp:?
is  the  non-TEI  namespace  prefix,  while  ?nps?
stands  for?no  preceding  space?
and  its  default  value  is?false?.
Naturally,  this  attribute  solves  issuesspecific to Polish and similar languages.
It can begeneralized  and  become  something  like@bound={?right?,  ?left?,  ?both?
},  and  in  thisshape, get incorporated into the TEI Guidelines.4.2 Structural  disjunction  between  alter-native segmentationsOne strategy to handle alternative segmentations,where the choice is between a single segment of3Note  that  here,  string-range()  is  an  XPointer  schemedefined by the TEI.
It is not to be confused with the string-range() function of the XPointer xpointer() scheme, definedby the W3C permanent working draft at http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-xpointer/.66the form <seg>New York</seg> and a sequenceof two separate segments, <seg>New</seg> and<seg>York</seg>, is to perform radical segmen-tation (always segment New and York separately)and provide an extra layer of alternative segmen-tation that  may link the two parts  of  the nameinto  a  single  unit.
This  is  what  we  do  in  thecreation  of  the  annotation  level  of  syntacticwords that may, e.g., need to link the three seg-ments of ??
?to-czerwony above into a single unit,because this is how they function in the syntacticrepresentation.In some cases, however, radical segmentationmay create  false  or  misleading  representations,and  Polish  again  provides  numerous  relevantexamples.
Sometimes  bound segments,  such asthe person-number clitics illustrated in (2) above,are homophonous with parts of words.

gar|?cie vs. gar?ciepot.acc|2pl fistful.nom.plOne may attempt to defend radical segmentationfor  case  (a)  on  the  not-so-innocent  assumptionthat segmenting tools might sometimes reach in-side  morphological  complexes  and separate  af-fixes  from stems,  rather  than clitics  from theirhosts.
However, examples (b) and (c) show thatthis is not a feasible approach here: the Instru-mental  czym in (b) is monomorphemic, and thesegmentation of  gar?cie ?fistfuls?
into  gar- and-?cie is  likewise  false,  because  the  putativesegment division would fall inside the root gar?
?.Thus, radical segmentation is not an availablestrategy  in  the  case  at  hand.
What  we  needinstead  is  a  way  to  express  the  disjunctionbetween  a  sequence  such  as  <seg>mia?</seg><seg>em</seg> (cf.
(5a)) on the one hand, andthe  single  segment  <seg>mia?em</seg>  on  theother.
It turns out that the TEI has no way of ex-pressing this kind of relationship structurally.The  TEI  Guidelines  offer  the  element<choice>, but it can only express disjunction bet-ween  competing  segments,  and  never  betweensequences thereof.
The Guidelines also offer twonon-structural methods of encoding disjunction.The first  uses the element  <join> (which is  anID-based equivalent of a bracket ?
it points to thesegments that are to be virtually joined) and theelement  <alt>  (which  points  at  encoding  alter-natives).
The  other  utilizes  the  @exclude  at-tribute, which, placed in one segment, points atelements that are to be ignored if the segment athand  is  valid  (the  excluded  elements,  in  turn,point back at the excluding segment).Recall that the intended size of the corpus isone billion segments.
Tools that process corporaof this size should not be forced to backtrack orlook forward to see what forms a sequence andwhat the alternative to this sequence is.
Instead,we  need  a  simple  structural  statement  of  dis-junction between sequences.
The solution  usedby  the  NCP  consists  in  (i)  adding  an  elementmeant to provide a semantically neutral bracket(<nkjp:paren>)  and  (ii)  including  <nkjp:paren>in the content model of <choice>.
Note that thisrepresentation can be readily converted into thepivot format of the LAF:(6)   <choice><seg>mia?em</seg><nkjp:paren><seg>mia?</seg><seg nkjp:nps=?true?>em</seg></nkjp:paren></choice>5 ConclusionWe have presented the TEI-P5-XML architectureof the National Corpus of Polish and identifiedsome  weak  points  of  the  TEI-based  stand-offapproach:  the  impossibility  of  keeping  theprimary text unannotated in the XInclude system,the loss of information on segment-boundedness,and  the  absence  of  a  structural  statement  ofdisjunction between sequences of segments (thislast  issue  is  also  due  to  the  lack,  among  thenumerous detailed markup options provided bythe  TEI,  of  a  semantically  neutral  bracket-likeelement  whose only role  would be to  embracesequences of elements).We are grateful to the two anonymous LAW-09 reviewers for their helpful comments.ReferencesIde, N. and L.
