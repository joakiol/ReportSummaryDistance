Proceedings of SADAATL 2014, pages 40?47,Dublin, Ireland, August 24, 2014.Pre-reordering Model of Chinese Special Sentencesfor Patent Machine TranslationRenfen Hu, Zhiying Liu, Lijiao Yang, Yaohong JinInstitute of Chinese Information Processing,Beijing Normal University,Beijing 100875, Chinabnuhurenfen@126.com{liuzhy,yanglijiao,jinyaohong}@bnu.edu.cnAbstractChinese prepositions play an important role in sentence reordering, especially in patent texts.
In this paper, arule-based model is proposed to deal with the long distance reordering of sentences with special prepositions.We firstly identify the prepositions and their syntax levels.
After that, sentences are parsed and transformed to bemuch closer to English word order with reordering rules.
After integrating our method into a patent MT system,the reordering and translation results of source language are effectively improved.1 IntroductionAs typical technical documents, Patents have proven to be suitable for automatic translation for itsstrict format and united writing pattern (Jin and Liu, 2011), and patent machine translation (MT) is oneof the major application fields of MT.
However, sentences in patent are known for their complicatedstructures with multiple verbs and prepositions.
Some Chinese prepositions are used to change theoriginal S-V-O order of sentences, such as ?
(BA), which make it more difficult for reordering inChinese-English machine translation.
In ancient Chinese, these prepositions are mostly verbs or othernotional words, and in modern Chinese they became grammatical markers after diachronic grammati-calization.
Huang(1998) and Miao(2005) discussed the reordering function of these prepositions, anddefined them as Logic-0 (L0) words.A linguistic study by Zhang(2001) shows that more than 20% Chinese sentences are reordered bythe prepositions, including ?
(BA), ?
(JIANG), ?
(XIANG), ?
(YU), ?
(DUI), ?
(GEI), ?
(BEI), ?
(YOU) and ?(WEI).
After analyzing sentences of 500 Chinese patent documents, we find that L0words appear more frequently in patent texts.
Sentences with 1 L0 word occupy 30.75%, sentenceswith 2 L0 word occupy 9.05%, and sentences with ?3 L0 words occupy 2.10%.
Therefore, Chinesespecial sentences with L0 words are concerned in this paper, and we will present a pre-reorderingmodel of these special sentences for patent translation.Figure 1 and Figure 2 show an example illustrating some of the differences in word order betweenChinese and English.Figure 1.

English syntax tree of the example sentenceThe example shows a Chinese sentence whose literal translation in English is:A/an YOU(L0) ultraviolet activate DE adhesive BA(L0) the sensor housing secure to the middlebracket housing.
(????????????????????????????
)And where a natural translation in English would beAn adhesive activated by ultraviolet secures the sensor housing to the middle bracket.As exemplified by this sentence, differences of word order between Chinese and English are deter-mined by BA and YOU, and they are in two different levels in the syntax tree.In order to produce a good English translation, we firstly identify L0 words in two levels, and parsethe sentence into chunks with core predicate and L0 words.
Based on the sentence parsing, chunks arereordered according to related rules, transforming Chinese special sentence into a word order that iscloser to that of English.
After integrating into a patent MT system running in SIPO (State IntellectualProperty Office of People's Republic of China)1, our model performs better than the baseline systemand Google Translate in an open test, and it greatly improves the performance of patent translation.After a discussion of related work in section 2 and an introduction to semantic features in section 3,we will discuss the reordering model in section 4.
Section 5 presents the processing steps, and section6 gives the experiment and evaluation.
Finally we draw some conclusions in section 7.2 Related WorksNowadays statistical machine translation (SMT) is the most widely used method in MT field, and re-ordering approaches are proved necessary in SMT performance(Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al,2005).
Most SMT systems employ some mechanism that allows reordering of the source languageduring translation(Wang et al, 2007), and researchers find that reordering based on syntactic analysisare effective for handling systematic differences in word order between source and target languages(Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al, 2005).Although sentence structure of source language has been taken into consideration, most SMT sys-tems make use of syntax information in decoding stage (Lin, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al,2005; Liu et al, 2006, Huang et al, 2006).
Wang et al.
(2007) firstly incorporate a Chinese syntacticreordering method into preprocessing stage of a statistical MT system, and achieve a significant im-provement in reordering accuracy.
Zhang et al.
(2007) propose a chunk-level method with reorderingrules automatically learned from source-side chunks, it shows improvement of BLEU score and bettercomputational efficiency than reordering during decoding in Chinese-English task.
Genzel(2010) ap-plies this approach to 8 different language pairs in phrase-based machine translation, and demonstratesthat many important order transformations (SVO to SOV or VSO, head modifier, verb movement) canbe captured by this approach.
An automatic reordering model in preprocessing also works effectivelyin Japanese-English patent machine translation(Katz-Brown and Collins, 2008).However, existing methods face difficulties in Chinese-English patent translation.
A Chinese patentsentence often contains multiple nested phrases with a number of verbs, prepositions and correlations.In addition to that, ambiguity of L0 words turns it more difficult for language parsers to make syntaxanalysis.
Moreover, reordering rules can hardly be automatically learned from patent sentences withcomplicate structures.
To deal with the long-distance reordering of special sentences in patent texts,1 http://c2e.cnpat.com.cn/sesame.aspx41we must fully consider semantic features of L0 words, including their positions, correlations, functions,ambiguities and levels.
With the identification of L0 words and their levels, we can parse and reorder asentence more explicitly.3 Semantic FeaturesA linguistic survey shows that S-V-O account for more than 75% of the world's languages, suggestingit may be somehow more initially ?obvious?
to human psychology(Crystal, 1997).
Both modern Chi-nese and English are S-V-O languages, however, word order in Chinese sentence is often changed byL0 words to emphasize a part of the sentence, or to make nuance of the meaning.
Our work aims atreordering Chinese special sentences to organize phrases or words in English order without L0 words.We have defined 9 Chinese prepositions as L0 words in Section 1.
To deal with the reordering of Chi-nese special sentences with these words, we use semantic features from the Hierarchical Network ofConcepts theory (HNC theory).
In the opinion of HNC researchers, L0 words and verbs are importantclues of syntactic and semantic analysis(Jin, 2010).
Therefore, we will introduce the features of L0words and verbs in the following part.3.1 Types of L0 WordsAccording to HNC theory, L0 words can be divided into 2 types, L01 and L02(Huang, 1998; Miao,2005).Sentence 1 Tom eats a banana.Sentence 2 Tom BA(?)
a banana eat.Sentence 3 A banana BEI(?)
Tom eat.In sentence 1, we know that Tom is an agent, and a banana is a patient.
Sentence 2 and 3 are ex-pressing the same meaning in Chinese with L0 words.
It can be seen that the two L0 words reorder thesentence in different ways, BA(?)
just exchanges the location of the predicate and the object, whileBEI(?)
changes the sentence from active to passive voice.
BA(?)
is a L02 word, and BEI(?)
be-longs to L01.
The types of L0 words are presented in Table 1.Types Members Semantic format  Example sentenceL01 ?
(BEI), ?
(YOU) , ?
(WEI) Patient+L01+Agent+Predicate Tom BA(?)
a banana eat.L02 ?
(BA), ?(JIANG),?(XIANG),?
(DUI), ?
(GEI), ?
(YU)Agent+L02+Patient/Recipient+PredicateA banana BEI(?)
Tom eat.Table 1.
Two types of L0 words3.2 Levels of L0 WordsBy comparing the syntax trees in Figure 1 and Figure 2, we can note that YOU(?)
appears in aNP(noun phrase), while BA(?)
appears independently in the sentence.
To distinguish the two kinds ofL0 words, we define a LEVEL value for L0 words according to their node locations in the syntax tree.L0 word as LEVEL[1] is a child node of S(sentence), while L0 as LEVEL[2] is a child node of NP.Accordingly, our reordering model includes two modules, the reordering of Sentence with L0 asLEVEL[1] and the reordering of NP with L0 as LEVEL[2].
Therefore, we need firstly identify the lev-el of each L0 word in sentences.3.3 Collocation with PredicatesMore than one L0 word may appear in a sentence, but each L0 is in combination with a certainpredicate.
As exemplified by the sentence in Figure 1, YOU(?)
goes with the verb activate, whileBA(?)
goes with the verb secure.
For this reason, L0 and its level can also help to determine thecore predicate when a sentence has more than one verb.Predicates are also classified into 2 types according to their levels in the syntax tree.
We give 2 sim-ple English sentences to explain the 2 types, P1 and P2.Sentence 4 Bob tells(P1) me a secret.Sentence 5 A secret told(P2) by Bob is spreading(P1).42As labelled in the 2 examples, P1 refers to the core predicate, and P2 is the predicate in a nounphrase.
L0 word in level 1 is in combination with P1, while L0 word in level 2 is in combination withP2.
The identification of the two types of predicates is introduced in detail by Zhu(2012).
Table 2shows the levels of L0 words and their collocations with predicates.L0 Level Parent Node Collocated PredicatesLEVEL[1] Sentence P1LEVEL[2] NP P2Table 2.
The collocations of L0 words and predicates4 Reordering Model of Chinese Special SentencesOur model aims at the reordering of Chinese special sentences with L0 words for patent machinetranslation.
With the identification of predicates, L0 words, and their levels (Hu et al, 2013), we canparse the sentence and get a Chinese syntax tree.
In this section, we will firstly introduce the transfor-mations and rules in the reordering, and then discuss how to transform the syntax tree to make theword order closer to English sentence.
Semantic features of L0 and verbs that we discussed in section3 will be applied into the model.4.1 Transformations in the ReorderingThere are 5 types of transformations in the processing of our reordering model.Deletion: L0 words are Chinese prepositions, so we need to delete or substitute them at first.Addition: Some L0 words have no real meanings, such as ?
(BA) and ?
(JIANG), we can makeother transformations after deleting them.
However, some L0 words have preposition meanings thatcannot be neglected, so we need to add English prepositions to the new tree.
This operation can also beinterpreted as ?substitution?.Copying: In long distance reordering, some chunks do not need any transformation, so we just copyit to the new syntax tree.Rearrangement: We need to rearrange the chunks to make the word order closer to English.Voice Transition: A research by Liu(2011) shows that 95.6% English patent sentences use passivevoice.
Considering the voice difference between Chinese and English, we transform some active sen-tences to passive sentences.4.2 Rule DescriptionThe above 5 transformations are integrated in our reordering rules.
We will describe how rules workwith Rule 1 as an example.Rule 1:(b){(-1)CHK[NP]}+(0)CHN[ ?
]&CHK[L0] +(1)CHK[NP]+(2)CHK[P1]&VV[2]=>(-1)+ COPY[-1,0]+ DEL_NODE(0)+(2){VOI=P}+ ADD_NODE(ENG=[by])+(1)Each reordering rule includes a left part and a right part, with arrow ?=>?
as the boundary.
CHK isshort for chunk, and VV is short for verb valency, which is a feature for verbs in our semanticknowledge base.
The left part describes chunks in the Chinese syntax tree, and each chunk is markedwith a node number.
The right part describes the reordering result.
In Rule 1, L0 ?
is deleted, Englishpreposition by is added, P1 is transformed to passive voice, contents between node 0 and node 1 arecopied to the new syntax tree, and the chunks orders are rearranged from (-1)+(0)+(1)+(2) to (-1)+COPY[-1,0]+(2)+by+(1).4.3 Reordering AnalysisAfter an introduction to our rules and their functions, we will present two examples to illustrate thereordering work.4.3.1 Reordering of Sentences43After analyzing sentences from 500 patent texts, 51 rules are made to deal with the sentences with L0as LEVEL[1].
We will discuss this reordering work with Sentence 6 as an example.Sentence 6 BA data to be transmitted divide into plural blocks.
(???????????????
)After identification of L0 words and predicates, we can get a syntax tree as shown in Figure 3.Figure 3.
Syntax tree of Sentence 6 before reorderingIn reordering stage, the sentence will be transformed by matching the following rule.Rule 2:(b){!CHK[NP]}+(0)CHN[?
]&CHK[L0]+(1)CHK[NP]+(2)CHK[P1]&VV[3]+(3)CHK[NP] =>DEL_NODE(0)+(1)+(2){VOI=P}+(3)After the transformation, we get a new syntax tree as shown in Figure 4.Figure 4.
Syntax tree of sentence 6 after reordering4.3.2 Reordering of Noun PhrasesIn patent texts, noun phrases are often long and complicated, as well as sentences.
We have made 31rules to deal with the reordering of NPs with L0 words.
Taking Sentence 7 as an example, we will pre-sent the reordering of NPs.Sentence 7 The fastener has YU mounting hole formed on the blade fit DE projection.
(???????????????????
)YU mounting hole formed on the blade fit DE projection is a NP with L0.
In this NP, YU is identi-fied as L0 in LEVEL[2], and fit is P2 in combination with L0.
By matching Rule 3, we can transformthe syntax tree in Figure 5 to a new syntax tree in Figure 6.Rule 3:(-3){CHK[L0]&CHN[ ?
]}+(-2)CHK[NP]+(-1)CHK[P2]+(0)CHN[ ? ]
+(1)CHK[NP] =>DEL_NODE(-3)+(1)+ADD_NODE(ENG=[which])+(-1){VOI=P}+ADD_NODE(ENG=[with])+(-2)+ DEL_NODE(0)Figure 5.
Syntax tree of the NP before reorderingFigure 6.
Syntax tree of the NP after reordering44Obviously, the word order in Figure 6 is much closer to English sentence than in Figure 5.5 Processing StepsThe reordering is processed in steps as follows.Step 1: To preprocess the Chinese sentence, including word segmentation and word-sense-disambiguation.Step 2: To identify predicates, L0 words and their levels.Step 3: To segment the sentence into chunks with L0 words(Level[1]) and predicates(P1) as bound-aries.Step 4: To reorder the sentences with L0 words(LEVEL[1]) based on transformation rules.Step 5: To reorder the NPs with L0 words(LEVEL[2]) based on transformation rules.Step 6: To generate a new syntax tree closer to English language order.6 Experiment and DiscussionThe experiment takes 500 authentic patent texts provided by SIPO (State Intellectual Property Officeof China) as the training set.
The evaluation will use the development data for the NTCIR-9 PatentMachine Translation Pilot Task2, containing 2,000 bilingual Chinese-English sentence pairs.After integrating into a rule-based patent machine translation system(Zhu et al, 2012), we will takea closed test on the training set, and an open test on the evaluation set.
To evaluate the effects of thereordering rules, precision and recall are calculated by manual evaluation for both two tests.
In theopen test, NIST (Doddington et al, 2002) and BLEU score (Papineni et al, 2002) are also employed toevaluate the translation performance.
Table 3 shows the result of the closed test.Table 3.
Experiment Result on the Training SetIt can be seen from table 3 that the reordering rules have higher accuracy and reliability than cover-age, and the module of sentence reordering performs better than NP reordering.In the open test, comparison is made as shown in table 4.
RB-MT is the baseline system.
RB-MT+PRM is the system integrated with our reordering model.
GOOGLE is an online statistical MTsystem, the reordering result of which is inferred from its translation result.
Table 4 shows the compar-ison in reordering of the three systems.Systems Precision (%) Recall (%) F-score (%)RB-MT 71.23 62.02 66.31RB-MT+PRM 88.11 75.90 81.55GOOGLE 60.71 51.20 55.56Table 4.
Compared Result of the Open TestThe result of the open test shows that our model has effectively improved the reordering result ofChinese special sentences, and Google performs poorly in this test.
It is mainly because statisticalmethods face difficulties in long distance reordering, and technical texts (including patent texts) ac-count for a fairly low proportion in the training bilingual corpus.
Thus, our method is advantageous inprocessing technical texts with long and complicated sentences.After calculating the precision and recall, we give NIST and BLEU scores of the three systems.
Inorder to learn the impact of the pre-reordering model in statistical machine translation, we also put the2 http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/ntcir-9/Types Precision (%) Recall (%) F-score (%)Sentences with L0 97.14 88.20 92.45NPs with L0 91.80 73.91 81.8945pre-reordered Chinese sentences into GOOGLE Translate and get the English translation result as acomparison.
The reordered sentences are obtained from intermediate outputs of RB-MT+PRM system.Systems NIST BLEU(%)RB-MT 4.85 19.97RB-MT+PRM 5.36 22.33GOOGLE  7.84 35.24GOOGLE+PRM 7.90 36.07Table 5.
NIST and BLEU-4 ScoresFrom table 5, we can see that after integrating the reordering model, NIST score of RB-MT systemhas increased by 10.52%, and BLEU score has increased by 11.82%.
Google also has an improvementwhen input texts are replaced by reordered sentences.
Since statistical machine translation has alreadyworked efficiently in short-distance reordering, its improvement is slighter than rule-based systems.Besides, Google Translate performs better in this evaluation.
It is mainly because the corpus domainis not limited, unknown terms or entities may result in a bad translation performance for rule-basedsystems.
In addition, the module of word selection in RB-MT needs to be improved urgently.
From theexperiment, we also find that the pre-reordering model is strongly dependent on the completeness ofrules and the accuracy of the knowledge base, which still need to be improved in the future work.7 ConclusionTo deal with the reordering of Chinese special sentences, we use a source-language parser to distin-guish the levels of L0 words and make transformations in the syntax tree.Our model improves the performance of patent machine translation.
In the future, the rule set andknowledge base need to be improved, and our reordering method can be extended to machine transla-tion of technical texts in other fields.ACKNOWLEDGMENTThe authors are grateful to National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(No.
