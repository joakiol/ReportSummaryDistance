eduAbstractIn the last decade, members of the computational lingt, is-tics community have adopted a perspective on discoursebased primarily on either Rhetorical Structure Theory orGrosz and Sidner's Theory.
However, only recently, re.+searchers have started to investigate the relationship be-tween the two perspectives.
In this paper, we use Moscrand Moore's (1996) work as a departure point for extend-ing Marcu's formalization of RST (1996).
The result isa tirst-order axiomatization of the mathematical prol+er-ties o1' text structures and of the rehttionship between thestrttcture of text and intentions.
The axiomatization en-ables one lo use intentions for reducing the ambiguity o1'discourse and the structure of discourse for deriving in-tentional inferences.I MotivationI n the last decade, members of the computational l inguis-lies cotnnmnity have adopted a perspective on discoursebased prinlarily on either l{hetorical Structure Theory(P, ST) (Matin and Thompson, 1988) or Grosz and Sidher's Theory (GST) (Grosz and Sidnet.
1986).In GSq, the linguistic onstituents are called discom'xesegments (DS) and the lingt, istic discourse slructure isexplicitly stipulated to be a tree o1' recursively embeddeddiscourse segments.
Each discourse segment is charac-tel+ized by a prinmry intention, which is called discomwesegment lmrpose (DSP).
GST identilies only two kindso1' intention-based relations that hold between the DSPsof two discourse segments: domittance and sati.@tctionprecedence.
When a discourse segment purpose DSPIthat characterizes discourse segment DS1 provides partof the satisfaction of a discourse segment purpose DSP.,that characterizes discourse segment DS..,, with DS1 be-ing embedded in DS2, it is said that there exists a domi-nance relation between DSP~ and DSlq, i.e., DSP.e dom-inates DSpI.
1t' the salislhction of DSP, is a condition ofthe satisfaction oI'DSP2, it is said that DSP1 sati,@tction-precedes DSP.,.RST has a richer ontology of relations than GST: in-tentional and semantic rhetorical relations are consideredto hold between non-overlaplfing textual spans.
Mostof these relations are asymmetric, i.e., they distinguishbetween their associated nuclei, which express what ismost essential to the writer's purpose, and their satellites,which support ile nuclei.
In RS'I, the linguisticdiscoursestructure is modeled recursively as a tree of related seg-ments.
Hence, unlike GSq, where relations are consid-ered to hold between the DSPs associated with embed-ded segments, relations in RST hold between adjacent,non-overlapping segments.Because RST has traditionally been applied to builddiscourse trees of liner granularity than GST, we willuse it here as the starting point of our discussion.
As-sume, for example, that we are given tim following text(in which the elementary textual units arc labelled lbrreference).
(I) INo mat lc r  how much one wants to stay a non-smoker, ^~ \]\[the truth is that the pressure to smoke in junior high isgreater than it will be any other time of one's life) q \]IWe know tim\[ 3,000 teens tart smoking each day, q \] lal-though it is a fact that 90% of them once thoughl thaismoking was something that Ihey'd never do.
D~ IAssume for the moment hat we do not analyze this textas a whole, but rather, we dctcrlnine what rhetorical rela-tions could hold between every pair of elementary units.When we apply, for example, the definitions proposedby Mann and Thompson (1988), we obtain the set givenbelow, l'rh, c~_,rcl(JUSTIFICNI'ION, AraB1)rhcl.rrel(J USTI FICATI()N, I)1 ~ I~,1 )(2) r/+ct_rcl(F, Vll)ENCF, (h ,  I~q)'rhcI._.rcl(CONCFSSION, I)i, C1 )'rhet_rcI(RFSTATF.MENT, 1)1, A1)These relations hold because the tmdcrstanding of bothA1 (teens want to stay non-smokers) and I:h (90% o1' theteens think that smoking is something that they wotddnever do) will increase the reader's readiness to acceptthe writer's right to present Ih (the pressure on teens tostart smoking is greater than it will be any other timeof their lives); the understanding of c1 (3000 teens startsmoking each day) will increase the reader's belief of1~1; the recognition of Ih as something compatible withIThroughoul this paper, we use the convention lhat rhelori-cal relations are represented as stated, lirst-order predicales hav-ing lhe fornl rhct_rel(,act.me, mLzellite, ?~mlcus).

What happens though when weconsider intentions as well?
Moore and Pollack (1992)have already shown that different high-level intentionsyield different RS-trces.
But how do we formalize tilerelationship between intentions and rhetorical structures?For example, how can we use the discourse trees in fig-ure 1 in order to determine the primary intention asso-ciated with each analysis?
And how can we determinewhat would be the corresponding dominance relations ina GST account of tile same text'?Consider also a slightly difl'erent problem: assume thatbesides rhetorical judgments, such as those shown in (2),one can also make intentional judgments.
For example,assume that one is interested in an interpretation i  whichone knows that the DSP of seg,nent \[&, D1\], which con-tains all units from A1 tO 1)1, dominates the DSP of seg-ment \[c1, l)~\].
Then what is the primary intention of thetext in that case'?
And how many discourse trees are bothvalid and consistent with that intentional judgment?
Nei-ther RST nor GST can answer these questions on theirown.
However, a unified theory can.
Ill this paper, weprovide such a theory.2 The limits of Moser and Moore'sapproachIn a recent proposal, Moser and Moore (1996) arguedthat the primary intentions in a GST representation canbe derived fi'om the nuclei ot'the corresponding RST rep-resentation.
Although their proposal is consistent withthe cases in which each textual span is characterized byan explicit nucleus that encodes the primary intention ofthat span (as in the case of text (I)), it seems that an ad-equate account of the correspondence b tween GST andRST is somewhat more complicated.
For example, in tilecase of text (3) below, whose RST analysis is shown inligure 2, we cannot apply Moser and Moore's approachbecause we can associate tile primary intention of dis-course segment \[a2, B2\] neither to trait A2 nor to trait B2.
(3) \[John wanted to play squash with Janet,Aq \[but heNONVOLITIONALCAUSEC2A2 B2Figure 2: A rhetorical analysis of text (3).also wanted to have dinner with Suzanne.
'~2\] [He wentcrazy, c2 \]In Grosz and Sidner's terms, we can say that the primaryintention ot' segment \[A2, B~\] is (Intend writer (Believereader "John wanted to do two things that were incom-patible")).
But in order to recognize this relation, weneed to recognize that the two desires given in units A~and B2 are incompatible, which is captured by the CON-TRAST relation that holds between the two units.
In otherwords, the intention associated with segment \[A2, B2\] is afunction both el' its nuclei, A 2 and B2, and of the rhetori-cal relation of CONTRAST that holds between them.In this paper, we generalize this obserwttion bymaking use o1" the compositionality criterion proposedin (Marcu, 1996), which stipulates that it 'a rhetoricalrelation holds between two textual spans, a si,nilar re-lation also holds between two salient constructs of thosespans.
2 Similarly, we will assume that the primary inten-tion of a discourse segment is not given by the nucleusof the corresponding relation but rather that it dependson the corresponding relation and the salient constructsassociated with that segment.3 Melding text structures and intentions3.1 Formulation of the problemFormally, the problem that we want to solve is thefollowing.
Given a sequence of textual units U =tq, u2 , .
.
.
,  UN, a set 1U~ of rhetorical relations that holdamong these units, and a set o1' intentional judgments IHthat pertain to the same units, find all legal discoursestructures (trees) of U, and determine the dominance,satisl'action-precedence relations, and primary intentionsof each span of these trees.Following (Marcu, 1996), we use tile predicatesposiHo,z(ui, j) and vl, eId'd(,za,,,e, s ,z) with the fol-2Seclion 3 discusses in detail how the salient construcls are deler-mined.524lowing semantics: tim predicate posilion(ui, j) is treefor a textual unit ul in sequence U if and only iful is the j-th element in the sequence; the predicaterhei_vel(namc, ui, uj) is true for textual units ul anduj witb respect o rhetorical relation name, if and onlyit' the detinition provided by RST for rhetorical relationname applies to textual units ui, in most cases a satellite,and uj, a nucleus.
In order to enable discourse prob-lems to be characterized by rhetorical judgments thathold between large textual spans as well, we use pred-icate rh.cl_rel_ext(namc, s~, s~, *~, n~).
This predicateis trl, e for textual spans \[ss, .%\] and \[,,.,, n0\] with respectto rhetorical relation name if and only if the detinition ofrhetorical relation name applies for tim textual span thatranges  over  units ss - - se ,  ill most  cases a satellite, alld tex-tual spans that ranges over units n.~-nc, a nucleus.
3From a rhetorical perspective, text (I) is described atthe minimal unit level by the relations given in (2) and (4)below.f l,ositio,,.
(A1,1), 1 ositio,~(lh, 2), (4) 1,ositio,,.
( C~ ,3), 1,ositio,,O), , 1)The intentional judgments 1~1 are given by the follow-ing functions and predicates:?
The predicate dom(l~, lq, 1~, h-,) is true whenevertbe DSP of discourse segment/span \[I1, hl\] domi-nates ttle DSI' of discourse segment \[l~, h:~\].
A dom-inance relation is well-formed if segment \[/~, h~\]is a proper subsegment of segment \[ll, h,t\].
i.e.,l, </~ < h., < h, A (h ?
z~ v h~ # h~).?
The predicate salpvec(ll, Ih, lu, h..,) is true when-ever an intentional satisfactiol>precedence relationholds between the DSI's of segments Ill, hi\] and\[/2, h2\].
A satisfaction-precedence relation is well-formed if tile segments do not overlap.?
Tile oracle function .fl(r, aq , .
.
.
,  ;%) takes as at:guments a rhetorical relation r and a set of texttuflunits, and returns tbe primary intention that pertainsto that relation and those units.
For example, inthe case of segment \[A2, Be\] in text (3), the ora-cle function .l) (CONTRAST,  A2, B2) is assu l l ted  toreturu a Iirst-order object wltose meaning can beglossed as "inform the reader that John wanted todo two things that were incompatible".
And theoracle function .1) (EWDI ~;NcE, B1) associated withsegntent \[A1,1)~\] in text (1) is assuntcd to returna \[irst-oMer object whose nteaning can be glossedas "increase the reader's belief that the pressure tosmoke in junior high is greater than it will be anyother time of one's life".Without restricting the generality of the problem, dis-course structures are assented to be binary trees.
In ourformalization, each node era discourse structure is char-aclerized by l()tu" features: the status (nucleus or satel-lite), tim O'lJe (the rhetorical relations tlmt hold between3'Fhe s ~llld e subscripls COlTCgpond Io .~tm'ling ~.lll(I ending posilions.the text spans that that node spans over), the l)romotionset (the set of units that constitute the most "salient" (ira-pertain) part of the text that is spanned by that node),and tile i)rima O, intelltion.
By convention, for each leafnode, the type is LEAF, the promotion set is tile textualunit to which it corresponds, and tbe primary intentionis that of inJbmting the content of that unit.
For exam-pie, a representation f the tree in ligure 1.a that makesexplicit the features el' all spans that play an active rolein the final representation is given in \[igure 3.
In general,the salient units are computed using the comlmsitionalitycriterion proposed in (Marcu, 1996), i.e, they are givenby the union of the salient units of the immediate sub-ordinated nuclei.
Similarly, the primary intentions are afunction of tbe rhetorical relation (type) and salient unitsof each span.The status, type, promotion set, and primary intentionthat are associated with each node in a discourse trec pro-vide suflieient information for a full description of an in-stance of a tree structure.
Given the linear nature of textand the fact that we cannot predict in advance where theboundaries between various segments will be d,'awn, weshould provide a lnethodology that permits one to enu-merate all possible ways in which a tree could bc builton the lop of a linear sequence of elementary discourseunits.
The solution we use relies on tile same intuitionthat constitutes tile foundation of chart parsing: just as achart parser is capable of consklering all possible waysin which different words in a sentence could be chlsteredinto higher-order grammatical units, so our formalizationis capable of considering all the possible ways in whichdifferent segments coukl be joined into discourse trees.l,et spa,tLj, or simply \[i,j\], denote a text spanthai includes all tile elementary discourse unils be-tween position i and j.

according to the role played by that spanin the tinal discot,rse tree.
For example, for thetree depicted in tigure 3, some of the relations thathold are: ,5'(1, 2, NUCLEUS),,5'(3, 4, SATELLITE),,5" (1 ,3 ,  NONE) .?
T(1, h, relation_ua.rn.e) provides the name of therhetorical relation that holds between the textspans that are immediate subordinates o1' spanEl, h\] in the discourse tree.
If the text span isnot used in the construction of the final tree,the type assigned is NONE.
For example, forthe tree in ligure 3, some o1' the relations thathold are: T( I ,  J, LEAF), 5/'(1,2, JUSTW~CATION),T(3, 4, CONC~SSrON), T(1, 3, NONE).?
P(I, h.,unit_name) provides one of the set ofunits that are salient for span El, h\].
The col-lection of units for which the predicate is trueprovides the promotion set of a span, i.e., allunits that are salient for that span.
If span \[1, h\]is not used in the tilml tree, by convention, theset of salient units is NONE.
For example, forthe tree in figure 3, some of the relations thathold are: P(1, 1., &) ,  P(1, 2, lh), P(1,3,  NONE),1'(3, 4, D,).?

In this lbrmalization, wc assume a uni-verse that consists of the set of natural numbers fi'om JtO N, where N represents the number of textual units inthe text that is considered; the set of names thai weredefined by Mann and Thompson for each rhetorical rela-tion; the set of unit names that are associated with eachtextual unit; and four exlra constants: NUCLEUS, SATEL-LITE, NONE, and LI~2AF.
The formalization is assumed loprovide unique name axioms for all these constants.The only funclion symbols that operate eve," the as-sumed domain are the mlditional + and - functions thatare associated with the set of natural numbers and the or-acle function J).
The formalization uses the traditionalpredicate symbols that pertain to the set of natural num-bers (<, <, >, >, =, ?)
and eight other predicate sym-bols: ,5', T, P and I to account for the status, type, salienlunits, and primary intention that are associated with ev-ery text span; vhel_vel to account for the rhetorical rela-lions that hold between different extual units; positionto account for the index of the textual units in lhe textdmt one considers; dora to account for dominance rela-tions; and satprec to account for satisfaction-precedencerelations.Throughout the paper, we apply the convention thatall unbound variables are universally quantified and thatvariables are represented in lower-case italics" and con-stants in SMALL CAPITALS.
We also make use of thetwo extra relations, vclevaul_uni~ and relevant_tel.For every text span span \[/, hi, relevant_unit(l, h, u)describes the set ot' textual units that are relevant forthat text span, i.e., the units whose positions in theinitial sequence are numbers in the interval \[l, hi.
Itis only these units that can be used to label the pro-526motion set associated with a tree that subsumes allunits in the interval \[l, hi.
For every text span \[1, h.\],vclevcm.Z_vcl(l, h, name) describes the set of rhetoricalrelations that are relevant to that text span, i.e., the set ofrhetorical relations that span over text units in the inter-val \[1, h\] and the set of extended rhetorical relations thatspan over text spans that cover the whole interval \[/, h\](see (Marcu, 1996) for the formal delinitions of these re-httions.
)For example, fin" text (1), which is descrihed formallyin (2) and (4), the following is the set of all rclc'~a~zl_reland vclevctn~_unil, relations that hold with respect to textsegment \[ l ,3\]:  {vclcvanLvcl(l,3, JUSTWlCaTtON),'rclcvanl_vcl(l, 3, EVII)ENCl0, relevcr, t_m~it(I, 3, &) ,, .~z~v.,,t_~,,nit( l ,  a, B~), , .d~, : .
, , z_ , , , , i t ( l ,  :~, q )} .The constraints that pertain to the discourse trees thatwe formalize can be partitioned into constraints related tothe domain of objects over which each predicate ranges,constraints related to the structure of the tree, and con-straints that relate the slrucltlral COlnponenl with the in-tentional component.
The axioms that pertain to the do-mains over which predicates ,5, P, and 7' range and theconstraints related to the structure of the live are the sameas those given by Marcu (1996).
For lhe sake of com-pleteness, in this paper we only enumerate then\] infor-mally.
In contrast, the axioms that pertain to intentionsand the relation between structure and intentions are dis-cussed in detail.Constraints that concern the objects over which thepredicates that describe every segment \[1, hi of a textstructure range (Mareu, 1996, pp.
1072-1073).,, For every siren \[/, h\], the set or objects over whichpredicate ,5' ranges is the set {NUC1A,~US, SNI'ELIJTI,\],NONE) .?
The status of any discourse segment is unique.?
For every segment \[l, h\], the set of objects overwhich predicate 7' ranges is the set of rhetorical  re-lations that are relevant to that span.?
At most one rhetorical rdation can connect two ad-jacent discourse spans?
The pr imary  intention of a discourse segment is ei-ther NONE or is a function of the sal ient units that  per-tain to that segment and of the rhetorical  relation thatholds between the immediate subordinated segments.Since we want to stay within the boundaries of Iirst-orderlogic, we express this (see formula (5) below) by meansof a disjunction of at most N sulfformulas, which corre-spond to the cases in which the span has I, 2 .

That is, whenever a rhetorical relationholds between two spans, either a simihu" relation holdsbetween Ihe mosl salicnl units of those spans or an ex-tended rhetorical relation holds between those spans.?

The dominance relations described by Grosz andSidner hold Between the DSP of a discoorse seg-ment and the DSP of'its most immediate subordinatedsatellite.
This constraint is consistent with Moser andMoore's (1996) discussion of RST and GST.
In fact, thisis not surprising if we examine the definitions of dom-inance relation given by Grosz and Sidner and satellitegiven by Mann and Thompson:  a discourse segmentpurpose D,5't?
dominates a discourse segment purposeD,5'1"1 if I),5'P\] contributes to the satisfaction el' theI),5'1?.
But this is exactly the role that satellites play inP, ST: they do not express what is most essential for thewriter's purpose, but rather, provide supporting informa-lion that contributes to the understanding of the nucleus.527The relationship between Grosz and Sidner's domi-nance relations and Mann and Thompson's distinctionbetween uclei and satellites is formalized by axioms (8)and (9).\[(1 ~ hl _< N) A(1 ~ 11 ~ I,.I)A(1 ~ h,9 ~ N) A (1.

Hence, axiom (8) explicatesthe relationship between the structure of discourse andintentional dominance.
In contrast, axiom (9) explicatesthe relationship between intentional dominance and dis-course structure.
That is, if we know that the intentionassociated with span \[lj, 1,1\] dominates the intention as-sociated with span \[12, h,2\], then both those spans play anactive role in the representation a d, moreover, the seg-ment \[12,11,2\] plays a SATELLITE role.?
The satisfaction-precedence rdations described byGrosz and Sidner are parataetie relations that holdbetween arlfitrarily large textual spans.
Neverthe-less, as we have seen in the examples discussed in thispaper, the fact that a paratactic relation holds betweenspans does not imply that there exists a satisfaction-precedence r lation at the intentional level between thosespans.
Therefore, for satisfaction-precedence relations,we will have only OnE axiom, that shown in (I0), below.\[(t 5 hJ ~ N) A (1 ~ 11 ~ hl) A (\] <" h,2 ~ N)A(1 o) 0 <- z~ _< ,'+2) A .,+,~,tv.,'~4.
'~, h,~, z~, \],.,_,)\] -+\[S(11, h,1, NUCI+EUS) A ,5'(12, h,2, NUCI,EUS)\]This specifiES that the spans that are arguments of asatisfaction-precedence relation have a NUCLEUS statusin the linal representation.4 A computat iona l  v iew o f  theax iomat i za t ionGiven the formulation discussed abovE, tinding the dis-course trees and the primary intentions lkw a text such asthat given in (1) amounts to finding a model for a first-order theory that consists of formulas (2), (4), and theaxioms enumerated in section 3.There are a number of ways in which one can pro-ceed with an implementation: for cxalnple, a smtight-forward choice is one that applies constraint-satisl'actiontechniques, an approach that extends that discussedin (Marcu, 1996).
Given a sequence U of N textual units,one can take advantage of the structure of the domain andassociate with each of the N(N-F 1)/2 possible text spansa status and a type variable whose domains consist in theset of objects over which the corresponding predicates,5 + and T, range.
For each of the N(N + 1)/2 possibletext spans \[l, h.\], one can also associate h, - l + \] promo-lion variables.
These are boolean variables that specifywhether units l, 1 + \ ] , .
.
.
, h belong to the promotion setof span \[/, hi.
For each of the N(N + 1)/2 possible textspans \[l, hi, one can also associate h - 1 + 2 intentionalvariables: one of these wtriables has as domain the setof rhetorical relations that are relevant for the span \[1, hi.The rest of the h - /+  1 wwiables are boolean and specifywhether unit l, l-t- \] .
.

.
, or h are arguments of the oraclefunction f~ that intentionally characterizes that span.Hence, each text of N units yields a constraint-satisfaction prohlem with N(N + I)(2N + \]3)/6 vari-ables (NCN q- \])(2N -}- 13)/(J = 2NCN q- \])/~ -}-V,2<=N V,h<----N I<=N W,h<=N(h_l_F2))).
(h ' - - l+ l )+~l -1  Z-,h.=l Z-,I=1 Z~,h=lThe constl+aints associated with these wtriables arc a one-to-onE mapping o1' the axioms in section 3.
Finding theset of RS-trees and the intentions that are associated witha given discourse reduces then to/inding all the solutionsfor a traditional constraint-satisfaction problem.5 App l i ca t ionsReasoning from text structures to intentions.
Con-sider again the example text (1), which was usEdthroughout this paper.
As we discussed in section 1, il'we assume that an analyst (or a program) determines thatthe rhetorical relations given in (2) hold between the el-ementary units of the text, there arc live valid trees thatcorrespond to text (1) (see figure 1).
If we consider nowthe axioms that dEscribE the relationship bEtwEen textstructures and intentions, we can infer, for example, thai,for the tree I.a, the DSP of span \[A1,131\] dominates theDSP of span \[cj, l)j\] and that the primary intention ofthe whole text depends on unit B1 and on the rhetori-cal relation of EVID\]\]NCF,.
Ill such a casE, the axiomati-zation provides the means for drawing intentional infer-ences on the basis of the discourse structure.
Also, al-though there are live discourse structures that are consis-tent with the rhetorical judgments in (I), they yield onlythree intentional interpretations, i.e., there arc only threeprimary intentions that one can associate to the wholetext.
One intention is that discussed above, which is as-sociated with analysis I.a.
Another intention depends onunit Bz and the JUSTIFICATION relation that holds be-tween units A1 and lh; this intention is associated withthe analyses hown in ligure 1.c and l.e.
And another in-tention depends on trait Bj and the JUSTIFICATION rela-tion that holds between units l)j and Bj ; this intention isassociated with the analyses hown in figure 1.b and 1.d.Reasoning fronl text structures to intentions can bealso beneficial hi a context such as that described byLochbaum (1998) because the rhetorical constraints canhelp prune the space of shared phms that woukl charac-terize an intEn tional interpretati o n of a d iscou rse.528Us ing  intentions lbr nmnaging rhetorical  aml f igu i t ies .Assume now that besides providing.ivdgments concern-ing the rhetorical rehttions that hold between variousunits, an analyst (ot" a progran0 provides judglnents ofintentions as well.
If, lk+t" cxaml+le, besides the relationsgiven in (2) a program determines that the DSP of spantAt, 1)1\] dominates 111o DSP of unit I/i, the theory thatcorresponds to these judgments and 111e axioms givenin section 3 yields only two wdid text structures, thosepresented in \[igure l.b and I.d.
In this ease, the axiom-atization provides the means of using intentional judg-ments for reducing the ambiguity that characterizes thediscourse parsing process.hwestigating the relationship between semantic andintentional relations.
In their seminal paper, Mooreand Polhtck (1992) showed lhat a text may be charac-terized by intentional and rhetorical analyses that are notisomorphic.
For example, for the text shown in (1 I) be-low, which is taken from (Moore and Pollack, 1992), onemay argue from an informational perspective that A3 isa CONI)ITION \['or B3.
However, l}'otll an intentional per-spective, one may argue thai 1',3 can be used to MOTI-VATI'; A3.
Similal + judgments can be made with respectto units 1{3 and c3.
Hence, lhe set of relations that COln-pletely characterizes text (11) is thal shown in (12) be-low.

Our approach does not provide yet themechanisms for choosing between different interpreta-tions, but it provides the foundations for such a study.
Incontrast, Moore and Pollaek's informal approach couldneither derive nor enumerate all possible interpretations:in fact, their discttssion refers only to the two treesshown in ligure 4.a and .b.Unlike Moore and Polhtck's approach, where it is sug-gested that a discourse representation should reflect si-multaneously both its informational nd intentional inter-pretations, the approach presented here is capable of onlyenumerating these interpretations.

Se-mantic or corpus-specific nformation was then used tomanage the usually large number of interpretations.The work described in this paper sets theoretical foun-dations that enable a similar approach to the study of dis-course.
The way a syntactic theory enables all wtlid syn-tactic trees of a sentence be derived, the same way theaxiomatization presented here enables all valid discoursetrees of a text be derived.
But the same way a sylltac-tic theory may produce trues that arc incorrect ftonl asemantic perspective for example, the same way the ax-iomalization described here may produce trees that areincorrect when, for example, focus and cohesion are fac-tored in.A ntmlber o1' researchers have ah'eady shown how in-dividual rhetorical and intentional judgments can be de-rived automatically l'mm linguistic constructs uch astense and aspect, certain patterns of pronominalizationand anaphoric usages, it-clefts, and discourse markers orcue phrases.
But once lhese.iudgmcnts arc made, we stillneed to determine all discourse interpretations that arenot only consistent with these judgments but also wtlid.This paper provides mechanisms for deriving and enu-merating all valid structure of a discourse and enables aquantitative study el' the relation between text structuresatld intentions.ReferencesNicholas Asher and Alex Lascarides.
