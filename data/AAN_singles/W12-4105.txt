Semantic relatedness is derivedfrom a term-topic co-occurrence matrix.
Thesense inventory is generated by the MetaMapprogram.
Word sense disambiguation is per-formed on a disambiguation graph via a ver-tex centrality measure.
The proposed methodachieves competitive performance on a bench-mark dataset.1 IntroductionWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) has been anopen problem in Computational Linguistics (Nav-igli, 2009).
It aims at identifying the correct mean-ing of an ambiguous word in a given context, e.g.,?adjustment?
could refer to individual adjustment oradjustment action in ?marital adjustment?
and ?di-etary adjustment?, respectively.Supervised methods outperform unsupervisedand knowledge-based methods (McInnes, 2009;Nguyen and Ock, 2010).
However, they require ex-pensive manual annotations and only the words ofwhich training data are available could be disam-biguated.
On the other hand, knowledge-based andunsupervised methods overcome the two shortcom-ings by using knowledge sources or untagged rawtexts (McInnes, 2008; Agirre et al, 2010; Ponzettoand Navigli, 2010).Among knowledge-based methods, the graph-based method using semantic relatedness achievesstate-of-the-art performance (Sinha and Mihalcea,Concept Semantic TypeIndividual adjustment Individual BehaviorAdjustment action Functional ConceptPsychological adjustment Mental ProcessTable 1: The UMLS concepts and appropriate SemanticTypes of the term ?adjustment?.2007; Nguyen and Ock, 2011).
This work aims atapplying the method to the biomedical domain.This paper proposes calculating semantic related-ness between Semantic Types based on the SemanticType Indexing (Humphrey et al, 2006) algorithm.WSD is then perform via a state-of-the-art graph-based method (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007).
The pro-posed method achieves competitive performance ona benchmark dataset.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2presents the graph-based WSD method; Section 3describes the calculation of semantic relatedness;Experimental results are showed in Section 4; Thepaper ends with conclusions in Section 5.2 The WSD MethodSense inventory is essential for WSD.
In the biomed-ical domain, the MetaMap program (Aronson, 2001)has been used to generate concept candidates inthe Unified Medical Language System (Bodenrei-der, 2004) (UMLS) for ambiguous terms.The concepts in the UMLS are assigned to pre-defined topics called Semantic Types (ST) (Table 1).Hence, STs could be efficiently used for disam-biguation of biomedical terms (Humphrey et al,2006).
For instance, if the term ?adjustment?
is25mapped to the ST Mental Process then it is disam-biguated as psychological adjustment.The WSD method used in this work is derivedfrom Sinha and Mihalcea (2007) with an additionalpostprocessing step (Humphrey et al, 2006).
Themethod consists of three steps:?
A disambiguation graph is generated for eachcontext.
The vertices are STs.
The edgeweight is semantic relatedness between STs(Section 3).?
Each ambiguous term is mapped to the ST withthe highest rank based on vertex centrality.?
The term is disambiguated as the appropriateconcept of the selected ST.On the one hand, i) the method achieves state-of-the-art performance for WSD on general texts us-ing WordNet (Miller, 1995) as sense inventory andthe source to calculate semantic relatedness (Sinhaand Mihalcea, 2007; Nguyen and Ock, 2011).
Byfar, semantic relatedness between biomedical con-cepts has been studied on the UMLS meta-thesaurus(Pedersen et al, 2007) but there has been no workon applying semantic relatedness (particularly be-tween STs) to biomedical WSD.
On the other hand,ii) the method is effective in terms of implementa-tion, comprehension, and computational complexity.2.1 Disambiguation GraphThe Algorithm 1 generates an undirected fullyconnected disambiguation graph for a context C ={w0, w1, ?
?
?
, wn}.
The dictionary D maps from anambiguous termwi to its ST candidatesD(wi).
D isgenerated by MetaMap.
Given a term wi, MetaMapgenerates a list of its UMLS concept candidates.
InUMLS, each concept is, in turn, assigned to oneor several STs.
From that, we can create a list ofST candidates for wi.
The resulted disambiguationgraphG contains vertices as STs and weight edge assemantic relatedness between STs.From line 1 to line 8, the algorithm generates thevertices of G from the dictionary.
From line 9 toline 15, the algorithm calculates the edge weight assemantic relatedness between STs (3).Algorithm 1 Disambiguation graph creationInput: Context {w0, w1, ?

: Quantitative Concept, ?patients?
:Patient or Disabled Group; ?mild?
: Qualitative Con-cept; ?symptoms?
: Functional Concept, Sign or26Figure 1: The disambiguation graph for ?Clinically, thesefour patients had mild symptoms which improved with di-etary adjustment?.
The edges containing the ST candi-dates of ?adjustment?
are solid lines, the rest are dot lines.Symptom; ?improved?
: Qualitative Concept, Intel-lectual Product; ?dietary?
: Food; ?adjustment?
: Indi-vidual Behavior, Functional Concept, Mental Pro-cess).
The disambiguation graph hence containseight STs (Fig.
1).If we want to disambiguate, for instance, ?adjust-ment?, we could compare the degree of its ST can-didates.
As seen in Fig.
1, Functional Concept isthe highest rank ST. Consequently, ?adjustment?
isdisambiguated as adjustment action (not individualadjustment or psychological adjustment).3 Semantic Relatedness between STs3.1 MotivationsPedersen et al (2007) show that there is no general-purpose measure among the six state-of-the-art se-mantic relatedness measures calculated based on theUMLS ontology and medical corpora.
For instance,the corpus-based measure is close to physician judg-ments while the path-based and information contentbased measures are close to medical coders judg-ments.
This is one of the main obstacles that preventthe use of semantic relatedness between concepts forbiomedical WSD.In another direction, Humphrey et al (2006) in-duce a term-ST matrix from medical corpora.
TheWSD method proposed in that work is similar tothe Lesk algorithm (Lesk, 1986) where each ST pro-file is compared with the context using the term-STmatrix to select the highest rank ST. Nguyen andOck (2011) show that using the same synset pro-files in WordNet, the Lesk-based method achieveshigher precision but lower recall than the semanticrelatedness-based method.3.2 The Proposed MeasureSemantic relatedness between STs is calculatedfrom a term-ST matrix Am,n proposed in the Se-mantic Type Indexing algorithm (Humphrey et al,2006) where m is the number of STs and n is thesize of vocabulary.
Ai,j is the normalized frequencythat the ith ST and the jth term co-occur.
Hence,each row of the matrix is an ST profile that can beused to calculate context-sensitive semantic related-ness between STs as follows:?
Given a set of terms {w0, w1, w2, ..., wn} in acontext C and the term-ST matrix A.?
The static vector of the ith ST is Ai, the ith rowof A.
A(i) contains all the terms in the vocabu-lary.
Ai(C) is generated from Ai by assigningzero to all the terms not in C .?
The context-sensitive semantic relatedness ofthe ith and jth STs is defined as the dot productof the two context-sensitive vectors:sr(STi, STj) = Ai(C) ?Aj(C) (3)4 Experiments4.1 Test DatasetThe NLM-WSD dataset contains 5,000 contexts of50 frequent ambiguous biomedical terms from thepaper abstracts of the 1998 MEDILINE database(Weeber et al, 2001).
Each ambiguous term has 100contexts including the surrounding sentence, papertitle and abstract.
The average number of senses perterm is 3.28.4.2 Experimental SetupsThe MetaMap program was used to generate ST can-didates of ambiguous terms.The most frequent sense (MFS) heuristic was usedas the baseline system: For each ambiguous term,27System A P R FSR 93.2 74.8 69.7 72.2Static-SR 95.0 66.2 62.9 64.5STI 93.2 74.1 69.0 71.5PPR 100.0 68.1 68.1 68.1MFS 100.0 85.5 85.5 85.5Table 2: Experimental results on the NLM-WSD dataset.the most frequent concept calculated based on theNLM-WSD dataset is simply selected.The experimental results were compared using at-tempted, precision, recall and F-measure (A, P, R,and F, respectively).4.3 Experimental ResultsThe proposed method, namely SR, was comparedwith three knowledge-based systems:?
Static-SR: The system uses static ST vectors,i.e., Ai, instead of context-sensitive ST vectors,i.e., Ai(C) as described in Section 3.?
STI1 (Humphrey et al, 2006): For a context,the rank of an ST candidate is the average ranksacross all words in the context, e.g., for thecontext Clinically, these four patients had mildsymptoms which improved with dietary adjust-ment, the rank of Functional Concept is [ .5314(?symptoms?)
+ .4714 (?adjustment?)
+ .7149(?patients?)
+ .1804 (?dietary?)
+ .7226 (?mild?
)+ .7282 (?improved?)
+ .7457 (?four?)
] / 7 =.5849.?
PPR2 (Agirre et al, 2010): The system uses theUMLS metathesaurus as a lexical knowledgegraph and executes the Personalized PageRank,a state-of-the-art graph-based method, on thegraph (Agirre and Soroa, 2009).The performance of the MFS baseline is remark-ably high, i.e., 85.5% of F-measure (Table 2).
Thisshows that the sense distribution in the biomedicaldomain is highly skewed.
Hence, this simple su-pervised heuristic outperformed all the investigatedknowledge-based systems.1Available as a component of the MetaMap program.2http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/ukbBecause STI and SR performed WSD via the dis-ambiguation of STs, the two systems failed when theST with the highest rank was assigned to at leasttwo concepts.
For instance, given the term ?cold?,if Disease or Syndrome scores the highest rank, thetwo systems cannot decide whether common coldor chronic obstructive airway disease is the correctconcept.
Hence, the attempted status of SR and STIdidn?t reach 100%.SR was remarkably superior to Static-SR whichempirically supports the context-sensitive ST vec-tors over static ones.
Overall, SR and STI achievedthe best performance.5 ConclusionsIn our experiments, the ST profiles were inducedfrom the term-ST co-occurrence matrix.
On theother hand, semantic relations and textual definitionsin WordNet are useful for word sense disambigua-tion (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010; Nguyen and Ock,2011).
Hence, the semantic relations between STsand the textual definitions of ST in the Unified Med-ical Language System could be potential resourcesfor the disambiguation of biomedical texts.The paper presents a graph-based method tobiomedical word sense disambiguation using se-mantic relatedness between pre-defined biomedicaltopics.
The proposed method achieves competitiveperformance on the NLM-WSD dataset.
Becausethe achieved performance is significantly inferior tothe performance of the most frequent sense heuris-tic, there is still more ground for improvement.AcknowledgmentsThis work is partially supported by a scholarship ofthe Korean Ministry of Information and Communi-cation.
