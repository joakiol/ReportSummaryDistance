TWO-COMPONF~ TEACHING SYSTEM THAT UNDERSTANDS ~ CORRECTS MISTAKESElena BORISSOVAInstitut Russkogo yazyka imP~shkinaMoscowAbstractThis paper presents a computer-tool tea-ching system supplied by a language proce-ssor.
Its aim is to correct mistakes intexts written by foreign students learningRussian as a second language.
Since a textmay include grammar mistakes, the systemcannot use morphological analysis to foolextent.
So one must compile a programmcapable of finding and correcting mistakeswithout traditional means of analysis.To solve this problem we prepone a systemthat includes a vocabalary and rules offinding and re-writing words.
So the pro-cess consists of finding word stems andthan correcting word endings .
Semanticand syntactic information("a model of ru-ling"/Mel'~uk 1974/~ necessary for thatis written in the vocabulary of verbsas a frame.
The slots of this frame con-tain semantic and morphological infor-mation about words that depend on thisvord~.The vocabulary containing now approxi-mately 200 lexemes is enough for beginnersI ?
IntroductionAs a rule, computer-tool teaching pro-grams ca~ do without language processors.That gives us an opportunity to use Perso-nal computers and other available and in~expensive means.
But such programs can beused only for several types of exercises:mostly those that include substitution orinsertion of listed words and endings in asentence.68USSRSuch exercises train the student to usecorrect\]F ~rds  and expressions?
It is im~possible to modell exercises of the so cal~led communicative type / Kostemarov et al1982/ that form the skills of spontaneousspeech ( a pupil constructs some sentencesexpressing his thoughts on a definite toypic).
While doing such exercises one cannotdeal with a limited list of variants as th6~re exists an infinite number of them(theyare innamerable if a pupil has masteredeven an elementary course).
That is whywe need a language aualisis processor ina computer-assisted teaching program aimedto teach somebody t%s~ the language~to ' c emm~uic ate '.There exists a lot of language analysisand synthesis programs of Russian appliedin Automatic translation, Natural langu~age dialogue systems etc.
Nevertheless itis impossible to ase them in computer as~sisted teaching programms.0n the one handthe majorit~ of them are oriented to thescientific or technological language.
Onthe other - and more importantly - as arule they cannot deal with texts contai-ning mistakes.
Those systems that'under~stand' a text with mistakes do net noticethem or they correct them only printingthem on a display/Carbonell,Hayes "198#/So it is necessary to compile a pro-gram capable of finding and correctingmistakes?
This problem is new for compu-tational linguistics.2~ Description of language processorTo solve the problem we propose a two-compone~tt language processor that provl~desmorphological, synt~.actic and (to some ex-tent) semantic analysis of a text with mis-takes, ~d then it synthesises correct sen-tences which express identical meaning to theanalysec~ ones.
This processor deals with se-parated ~:entences but some informationmust be used while analysing subsequent sen-tences of the given text (e.g.
informationabout the sex of a speaker as in a Russiantext tlds information is necessary for ag~reement of a predicate in the Past anda subject expressed by the pronoun ofthe 1st person singular: ya chodil~I wasgoing,The 1st ste~.
The processor executes a mor-phological analysis of a sentence by meansof a stem vocabulary which includes vari-ants of the stems of each verb (e.g.CHOD-,CHOJ~ of the verb CHODIT' ~to goOetc.
),noun~ adverb, adjective, pronoun.
Thislist lacludes the typical incorrect vari-ants oZ these stems (e.g.
ZOV-, ZAV- ofthe verb ZVAT'~to cal~; a typical mistakeis ZAVU instead of ZOVU).
The first taskof the processor is to find a verb andto identify it in the vocabulary.The 2rid ste~ .
The system uses syntacticinformation of the vocabulary.
Every verbstem is supplied with information of themorphological, syntactic and semanticfeatures of words w~ch are ruled by theverb (e.g.
JIT' ~to live~v chem 'place').Since all the nouns in the vocabulary aresupplied with semantic information as well(eog; DOM(a house~'place'), that enablesthe s~stem to find appropriate nouns forthe verb.Then in accordance with the morphologicalinformation the system eynthesises a correctcase form of the noun (e.g.
V DOME) whichis compared with the form written by the pu-pil.
The difference is marked as a mistakethat can be commented on by the list of ex-planations (e.g.
a pupil: Jivu dom, a correctrect form, synthesised by the system is Ji-vu v dome, mistake: "a wrong case form")The3d step.
Then the system accomplishesagreement of subject and predicate (e.g.Student sg ,m~ sg.m rA student live~) ac-cording to the semantic information the verbis supplied with (e.g; JIT' 'person' STU-DENT 'person') and morphological informa-tion of the subject.
The temporal and as-pectual characteristics of verbs dependon adverbs (e.g.
vchera CyesterdayOpast -jilAtlived~past) and some other facts.
Ac-cording to this information the systemsynthesises verbal forms and compares themwith those written by the pupil.The 4th step.
The agreement between adjec-tives and nouns is executed in the same wayas the previously - by finding words accor~ding to the semantic features (e;g; no~Cnew~'thing','place'... dom~a hoase~,place ,)and then by changing of the forms accor-ding to the morphological information (e.g.dom m - novyi m)3.Some notes on system exploatingThe result of this system's work shouldbe a correct text with the correction ofmistakes.
A system based on the same prin-ciples but more complex should correctsome syntactic mistakes in word order,usage if conjunctions etc.If the result of the correction allowstwo possible variants of a text, the com-puter prints:"De you want to say"..." or69"..."?
(Possible variants - in invertedcommas).
If a sentence is not admissibleby the given system, a computer prints:"I do not understand you, say it anotherw~" .The system can ask other questions as well.In particular, if a pupil prints a personalname unknown to the system it asks:"Is ita male or female?"
and then this name isinserted into the vocabulary with morpho-logical characteristics fe~m.
or mas__cc.Besides the grammatical information thevocabulary should include some encyclopaedi~cal information important for a pupil.
E.g.if a foreign pupul has come to Moscow al~ready then the phrase Ja priedu v ~oskva~I'll come to Moscow~is wrong.
In order tocorrect such mistakes one inserts intothe morphological and syntactic infor-mation an inscription : PRIYEHAT' ~ I  ~-past- v Moskvurto M~scow which means thata prase about 1 p.sg.
and Moscow is correctonly in the past.Prelimenary input of proper names whicha learner ma~ have occasion use in atext is desireable as well.
Otherwisemistakes of the type Ya priehal iz kuba(instea~ of s Kuby) woul6 not be correc-ted.The system is intended both for testingcompositions and dialogues.
Since systemsfor advanced students would be too sophis-ticated and would have to include comp-lete information about the language,nowadays we restrict ourselves to a sys-tem for beginners (150 lexemes in the vo-cabulary).
The system will be realised onthe IBM-PCReference~Mel'~uk I.A ~ 0pyt teorii lingulstlceskih?
