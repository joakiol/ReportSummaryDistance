Computat ion  of Word Associat ions Based onthe Co-Occurences of Words in Large Corpora IManfred Wettler & Reinhard RappUniversity of Paderborn, Cognitive PsychologyPostfach 1621, D-4790 Paderborn, GermanyAbstractA statistical model is presented which predicts the strengths of word-associations from therelative frequencies of the common occurrences of words in large bodies of text.
Thesepredictions are compared with the Minnesota association norms for 100 stimulus words.
Theaverage agreement between the predicted and the observed responses is only slightly weakerthan the agreement between the responses of an arbitrary subject and the responses of theother subjects.
It is shown that the approach leads to equally good results for both Englishand German.1 In t roduct ionIn the association experiment first used by Galton (1880) subjects are asked to respond toa stimulus word with the first word that comes to their mind.
These associative responseshave been explained in psychology by the principle of learning by contiguity: "Objects onceexperienced together tend to become associated in the imagination, so that when any one ofthem is thought of, the others are likely to be thought of also, in the same order of sequenceor coexistence as before.
This statement we may name the law of mental association bycontiguity."
(William James, 1890, p. 561).When the association experiment is conducted with many subjects, tables are obtainedwhich list the frequencies ofparticular responses to the stimulus words.
These tables are calledassociation norms.
Many studies in psychology give evidence that there is a relation betweenthe perception, learning and forgetting of verbal material and the associations between words.If we assume that word-associations determine language production, then it should bepossible to estimate the strength of an associative r lation between two words on the basisof the relative frequencies that these words co-occur in texts.
Church et al (1989), Wettler& Rapp (1989) and Church & Hanks (1990) describe algorithms which do this.
However, thevalidity of these algorithms has not been tested by systematic comparisons with associationsof human subjects.
This paper describes uch a comparison and shows that corpus-basedcomputations of word associations are similar to association orms collected from humansubjects.According to the law of association by contiguity, the association strength between twowords should be a function of the relative frequency of the two words being perceived together,i.e.
the relative frequency of the two words occuring together.
Further more, the associationstrength between words should determine word selection during language or speech produc-tion: Only those words can be uttered or written down which associativeiy come to mind.If this assumption holds, then it should be possible to predict word associations from thecommon occurences of words in texts.IThis research was supported by the Heinz-Nixdorf-lnstitute (project 536)842 Mode lAccording to the law of association by contiguity the learning of associations can be describedas follows: If two words i and j occur together, the association strength aid(t) between i andj is increased by a constant fraction of the difference between the maximum and the actualassociation strength.
This leads for association strengths between 0 and 1 to the followingformula:aid (t + 1) = aid(t) + (1 - aid (t)).
01 if (i&j) (1)If word i occurs in another context, i. e. not in proximity to word j,  the association strengthbetween i and j is decreased by a constant fraction:aid (t + 1) = ai,j(t).
(1 - 02) if (i&-~j) (2)Under the assumption that the learning rate 01 and the inhibition rate 02 are of identicalsize, the expected value aid of the association strength aid(t) from i to j for t ~ o~ is equalto the conditional probability of j given i (compare Foppa, 1965):ai,j = p(jli) (3)From these assumptions it could be expected that a stimulus word i leads to those responsej ,  for which the value of equation 3 is at a maximum.Rapp & Wettler (1991) compared this with other predictions, where additional assump-tions on learning and reproduction were taken into account.
With equation 3, mainly wordswith high corpus frequencies, e. g. function words, were predicted as associative responses.The predictions were improved when the following formula was used with an exponent ofa = 0.66, and the word with the highest rid was considered to be the associative response.p(jli) (4) = p(j)'-"7The introduction of the denominator indicates that in the association experiment less frequentwords are used than during language production.
This inhibition of frequent words can beexplained by the experimental situation, which furthers responses that are specific to thestimulus word.
The exponential function can be interpreted as the tendency that subjectiveestimations are often found to be exponential functions of the quantities to be estimated.3 Assoc ia t ion  norms usedFor the comparison between the predicted and the associations of human subjects we haveused the association orms coUected by Russet\] ~ Jenkins (Jenkins, 1970).
They have theadvantage that translations of the stimulus words were also given to German subjects (Russell& Meseck, 1959, and RusseLl, 1970) so that our model could be tested for English as well asfor German.The Russell & Jenkins association orms, also referred to as the Minnesota word associ-ation norms, were collected in 1952.
The I00 stimulus words from the Kent-Rosanoff wordassociation test (Kent ~ Rosanoff, 1910) were presented to 1008 students of two large intro-ductory psychology classes at the University of Minnesota.
The subjects were instructed, towrite after each word "the first word that it makes you think of ' .
Seven years later, RussellMeseck (1959) repeated the same experiment in Germany with a carefully translated list ofthe stimulus words.
The subjects were 331 students and pupils from the area near W~rzburg.The quantitative r sults reported on later will be based on comparisons with these norms.85The American as well as the German association norms were collected more than 30 yearsago.
The texts Which were used to simulate these associations are more recent.
One mightexpect therefore that this discrepancy will impair the agreement between the observed andthe predicted responses.
Better predictions might be attained if the observed associations hadbeen produced by the same subjects as the texts from which the predictions are computed.However, such a procedure is hardly realizable, and our results will show that despite thesediscrepancies associations to common words can be predicted successfully.4 Text  corporaIn order to get reliable estimates of the co-occurences of words, large text corpora have to beused.
Since associations of the "average subject" are to be simulated, the texts should notbe specific to a certain domain, but reflect the wide distribution of different ypes of textsand speech as perceived in every day life.The following selection of some 33 million words of machine readable English texts usedin this study is a modest attempt o achieve this goal:?
Brown corpus of present day American English (1 million words)?
LOB corpus of present day British English (1 million words)?
Belletristic literature from Project Gutenberg (1 million words)?
Articles from the New Scientist from Oxford Text Archive (1 million words)?
Wall Street Journal from the ACL/DCI (selection of 6 million words)?
Hansard Corpus.
Proceedings of the Canadian Parliament (selection of 5 million wordsfrom the ACL/DCI-corpus)?
Grolier's Electronic Encyclopedia (8 million words)?
Psychological Abstracts from PsycLIT (selection of 3.5 million words)?
Agricultural abstracts from the Agricola database (3.5 million words)?
DOE scientific abstracts from the ACL/DCI (selection of 3 million words)To compute associations for German the following corpora comprising about 21 million wordswere used:?
LIMAS corpus of present-day written German (1.1 million words)?
Freiburger Korpus from the Institute for German Language (IDS), Mannheim (0.5million words of spoken German)?
Ma~nheimer Korpus 1 from the IDS (2.2 million words of present-day written Germanfrom books and periodicals)?
Handbuchkorpora 85, 86 and 87 from the IDS (9.3 million words of newspaper texts)?
German abstracts from the psychological database PSYNDEX (8 million words)For technical reasons, not all words occuring in the corpora have been used in the simulation.The vocabulary used consists of all words which appear more than ten times in the Englishor German corpus.
It also includes all 100 stimulus words and all responses in the Englishor German association orms.
This leads to an English vocabulary of about 72000 and aGerman vocabulary of 65000 words.
Hereby, a word is defined as a string of alpha charactersseparated by non-alpha characters.
Punctuation marks and special characters axe treated aswords.865 Computat ion of the association strengthsThe text corpora were read in word by word.
Whenever one of the 100 stimulus wordsoccured, it was determined which other words occured within a distance of twelve words tothe left or to the right of the stimulus word, and for every pair a counter was updated.
Theso defined frequencies of co-occurence tt(i&j), the frequencies of the single words tt(i) andthe total number of words in the corpus Q were stored in tables.
Using these tables, theprobabilities in formula (4) can be replaced by relative frequencies:tt( i&j) It( j) a Qo H(i&j)n(i) / Qo = H(j)o (5)In this formula the first term on the right side does not depend on j and therefore has noeffect on the prediction of the associative response.
With H(j) in the denominator f thesecond term, estimation errors have a strong impact on the association strengths for rarewords.
Therefore, by modifying formula (5), words with low corpus frequencies had to beweakened.. ~ H(i&j)/H(j)  ~ fiir H(j) > ~.Q,'i,j = Q)  f ir H(j) < Z" Q (6)According to our model the word j with the highest associative strength ~/,./to the stimulusword / should be the associative response.
The best results were observed when parametera was chosen to be 0.66.
Parameters ~5 and 3' turned out to be relatively uncritical, andtherefore to simplify parameter optimization were both set to the same value of 0.00002.Ongoing research shows that formula (6) has a number of weaknesses, for example thatit does not discriminate words with co-occurence-frequency zero, as discussed by Gale &Church (1990) in a comparable context.
However, since the results reported on later areacceptable, it probably gets the major issues right.
One is, that subjects usually respondwith common, i.e.
frequent words in the free association task.
The other is, that estimationsof co-occurence-frequencies for low-frequency-words are too poor to be useful.6 ResultsIn table 1 a few sample association lists as predicted by our system are compared to the as-sociative responses as given by the subjects in the Russell ~ Jenkins experiment.
A completelist of the predicted and observed responses i given in table 2.
It shows for all 100 stimuluswords used in the association experiment conducted by Russell & Jenkins, a) their corpusfrequency, b) the primary response, i.e.
the most frequent response given by the subjects,c) the number of subjects who gave the primary response, d) the predicted response ande) the number of subjects who gave the predicted response.The valuation of the predictions has to take into account hat association orms areconglomerates of the answers of different subjects which differ considerably from each other.A satisfactory prediction would be proven if the difference between the predicted and theobserved responses were about equal to the difference between an average subject and therest of the subjects.
The following interpretations look for such correspondences.For 17 out of the 100 stimulus words the predicted response is equal to the observedprimary response.
Tiffs compares to an average of 37 primary responses given by a subjectin the Russell & Jenkins experiment.
A slightly better result is obtained for the correspon-dence between the predicted and the observed associations when it is considered, how many87Stim- Predicted ri,j Observed No.ulus Responses Responses Subj.l~lue green 2.144 sky 175red 1.128 red 160yellow 1.000 green 125white 0.732 color 66flowers 0.614 yellow 56sky 0.600 black 49colors 0.538 white 44eyes 0.471 water 36bright 0.457 grey 28color 0.413 boy 20butter bread 0.886 bread 637milk 0.256 yellow 81eggs 0.197 soft 30Ib 0.179 fat 24sugar 0.157 food 22fat 0.147 knife 20peanut 0.145 eggs 16fats 0.138 cream 14flavor 0.130 milk 13wheat 0.128 cheese 9baby mother 0.618 boy 162foods 0.427 child 142breast 0.353 cry 113feeding 0.336 mother 71infant 0.249 girl 51birth 0.245 small 43born 0.242 infant 27milk 0.208 cute 21her 0.206 little 18nursing 0.202 blue 17cold hot 1.173 hot 348warm 1.164 snow 218weather 0 .736  warm 168winter 0.603 winter 66climate 0.474 ice 29air 0.424 Minnesota 13war 0.342 wet 13wet 0.333 dark 10water 0.330 sick 9dry 0.315 heat 8Table I: Comparison between the ten strongest pre-dicted and the ten most frequent observed responsesfor four stimulus words, rij was computed accord-ing to formula 6.subjects had given the predictedresponse: Averaged over all stim-ulus words and all subjects, apredicted response was given by12.6% of the subjects.
By com-parison, an associative response ofan arbitrary subject was given by21.9% of the remaining subjects.When only those 27 stimuluswords are considered, whose pri-mary response was given by atleast 500 subjects, an arbitraryresponse was given by 45.5% ofthe subjects on average.
By com-parison, the predicted response toone of these 27 stimulus wordswas given by 32.6% of the sub-jects.
This means, that for stim-ulus words where the variationamong subjects is small, the pre-dictions improve.On the other hand, 35 of thepredicted responses were given byno subject at all, whereas an av-erage subject gives only 5.9 out of100 responses that are given by noother subject.
In about half of thecases we attribute this poor per-formance to the lack of represen-tativity of the corpus.
For exam-ple, the predictions combustion tothe stimulus bed or brokerage tohouse can be explained by specificverbal usage in the DOE scientificabstracts respectively in the WallStreet Journal.In most other cases instead ofparadigmatic associations (wordsthat are used in similar contexts)syntagmatic associations (wordsthat are often used together) arepredicted.
Examples are the pre-diction of term to the stimuluslong, where most subjects an-swered with short, or the predic-tion of folk to music, where mostsubjects responded with song.88stimafraidangerbabybathbeautifulbedBiblebitterblackblossomblueboybreadbutterbutterflycabbagecarpetchaircheesechildcitizencitycoldcomfortcommandcottagedarkdeepdoctordreameagleeartheatingfootfruitgirlgreenhammerhandhardheadhealthheavyhighhousehungryjoyjusticeking'lampfreq692615115724481212955935414250501676117486342668116138577566889752581252003386799137169524187666299214292823116918411096168617351463502535011433349725220305926824613141983330par f (par)fearmadboycleanuglysleepGodsweetwhiteflowerskygirlbutterbreadmothheadrugtablecrackersbaby(ies)U.S.(A.

Observed and predicted associative responses to stimulus words 51 to 100.90Using the corpora listed in section 4, the same simulation as described above was conductedfor German.
For the computation of the associative strengths, again formula 6 was used.
Foroptimal results, only a small adjustment had to be made to parameter alpha (from 0.66 to0.68).
However, a significant change was necessary for parameters/~ and 7, which again forease of parameter optimization were assumed to be identical.
~ and 7 had to be reduced bya factor of approximately four from a value of 0.00002 to a value of 0.000005.
Apart fromthese parameters, nothing was changed in the algorithm.Table 3 compares the quantitative results as given above for both languages.
Thefigures can be interpreted as follows: With an average of 21.9% of the other subjects givingthe same response as an arbitrary subject, the variation among subjects is much smaller inEnglish than it is in German (8.7%).
This is reflected in the simulation results, where bothfigures (12.6% and 6.9%) have a similar ratio, however at a lower level.This observation is confirmed when only stimuli with low variation of the associative re-sponses are considered.
In both languages, the decrease in variation is in about the sameorder of magnitude for experiment and simulation.
Overall, the simulation results are some-what better for German than they are for English.
This may be surprising, since with atotal of 33 million words the English corpus is larger than the German with 21 million words.However, if one has a closer look at the texts, it becomes clear, that the German corpus,by incorporating popular newspapers and spoken language, is clearly more representative toeveryday language.Descriptionpercentage of subjects who give the predicted associativeresponsepercentage of other subjects who give the response of anarbitrary subjectpercentage of subjects who give the predicted associativeresponse for stimuli with little response variation"percentage of other subjects who give the response of anarbitrary subject for stimuli with little response variation*percentage of cases where the predicted response isidentical to the observed primary responsepercentage of cases where the response of an arbitrarysubject is identical to the observed primary responsepercentage of cases where the predicted response is givenby no subject ?

In the German study, only those 25 stimulus words are taken into account,wh~e primary response is given by at least 100 out of 331 subjects.
**) for comparison ofEnglish andGerman experimental figures, it should be kept in mind, that the American experiment was conductedwith 1008, but the German experiment with only 331 subjects.93.7 Discussion and conclusionIn the simulation results a bias towards yntagmatic associations was found.
Since the as-sociations were computed from co-occurences of words in texts, this preference of syntag-matic associations i  not surprising.
It is remarkable, instead, that many associations usuallyconsidered to be paradigmatic are predicted correctly.
Examples include man --  woman,black ~ white and bitter ~ sweet.
We believe, however, that the tendency to prefer syntag-matic associations can be reduced by not counting co-occurences found within collocations.Equivalently, the association strength between word pairs always occuring together in a strictformation (separated by a constant number of other words) could be reduced.When going from English to German, the parameters /~ and '7 in equation 6 neededto be readjusted in such a way, that less frequent words obtained a better chance to beassociated.
This reflects the fact, that there is more variation in the associative responsesof German than of American subjects, and that American subjects tend to respond withwords of higher corpus frequency.
We believe that by considering additional languages thisparameter adjustment could be predicted from word-frequency-distribution.In conclusion, the results show, that free word associations for English and German canbe successfully predicted by an almost identical algorithm which is based on the co-occurence-frequencies of words in texts.
Some peculiarities in the associative behavior of the subjectswere confirmed in the simulation.
Together, this is a good indication that the learning ofword associations i  governed by the law of association by contiguity.Although our simulation results are not perfect, specialized versions of our program havealready proved useful in a number of applications:?
Information Retrieval: Generation of search terms for document retrieval in biblio-graphic databases (Wettler & Rapp, 1989, Ferber, Wettler & Rapp, 1993).?
Marketing: Association orms are useful to predict what effects word usage in adver-tisements has on people (Wettler & Rapp, 1993).
Muitilingual assocation orms helpto find a global marketing strategy in international markets (Kroeber-Riel, 1992).?
Machine Translation: In an experimental prototype we have shown that associations de-rived from context are useful to find the correct ranslations for semantically ambiguouswords.The successful prediction of different types of verbal behavior on the basis of co-occurrencesof words in texts is a direct application of the classical contiguity-theory, or in more modernneurophysiological terms, of Hebb's learning rule.
Cognitive psychology has severely criti-cized contiguity-theory with the arguments that association theory did not produce usefulresults (Jenkins, 1974), and that associations are not the result of associative l arning but ofunderlying semantic processes (Clark, 1970).
Both arguments need a critical revision.
Re-cent work with large corpora as well as a large number of connectionist udies have yieldedvery useful results in different psychological domains, and the high predictive power of theassociationist approach makes that the intuitive appeal of cognitivist explanations i fadingrapidly.ReferencesClark, H.H.
