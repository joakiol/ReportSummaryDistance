A Framework  for Process ing Part ia l ly  Free Word  Order*Hans UszkoreitArtificial Intelligence CenterSRI International333 Ravenswood AvenueMenlo Park, CA 94025Abst ractThe partially free word order in German belongs to theclass of phenomena in natttral anguage that require a close in-teraction between syntax and pragmatics.
Several competingprinciples, which are based on syntactic and on discourse in-formation, determine the \[ineac order of noun phrases.
A solu-tion to problems of this sort is a prerequisite for high-qualitylanguage generation.
The linguistic framework of GeneralizedPhrase Structure Grammar offers tools for dealing with-wordorder variation.
Some slight modifications to the framework al-low for an analysis of the German data that incorporates justthe right, degree of interaction between syntactic and pragmaticcomponents and that can account for conflicting ordering state-ments.I.
In t roduct ionThe relatively free order of major phrasal constituents inGerman belongs to the class of natural-language phenomenathat require a closer interaction of syntax and pragmaticsthan is usually accounted for in formal linguistic frameworks.Computational linguists who pay attention to both syntax andpragmatics will find that analyses of such phenomena can providevaluable data for the design of systems that integrate these lin-guist ic components.German represents a good test case because the role ofpragmatics in governing word order is much greater than inEnglish while the role syntax plays is greater than in some of theso-called free-word-order languages like Warlpiri.
The  Germandata are well attested and thoroughly discussed in the descriptiveliterature The fact that English and German are closely relatedmakes it easier to assess these data and to draw parallels.The .~imple analysis presented here for dealing withfree word order in German syntax is based on the linguisticframework of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG},especially on its Immediate Dominance/Linear Precedence for-malism {ID/LP), and complements an earlier treatment ofGerman word order) The framework is slightly modified to ac-commodate the relevant class of word order regularities.The syntactic framework presented in this paper is nothound to any particular theory of discourse processing; it enablessyntax to interact with whatever formal model of pragmatics onemight want to implement.
A brief discussion of the framework'simplication~ for computational implementation centers Upon theproblem of the status of metagrammatical devices.2.
The  Prob lemGerman word order is essentially fixed: however, there issome freedom in the ordering of major phrasal categories likeNPs  and adverbial phrases - for example, in the linear order ofsubject (SUB J), direct object (DOBJ), and indirect object (lOB J)with respect o one another.
All six permutations of these threeconstituents are possible for sentences like (In).
Two are givenas {Ib) and (It).
(la) Dann hatte der Doktor dem Mann die Pille gegeben.Then had the doctor the man the pill given(lb) Dann hatte dec Doktor die Pille dem Mann gegeben.Then had the doctor the pill the man given(It) Dann hatte die Pille der Doktor dem Mann gegeben.Then had the pill the doctor the man givenAll permutations have the same truth conditional meaning,which can be paraphrased in English as: Then the doctor gavethe man the pill.There are several basic principles that influence the order-ing of the three major NPs:?
The unmarked order is SUBJ-iOBJ-DOBJ?
Comment (or focus) follows non-comments* Personal pronouns precede other NPs?
Light constituents precede heavy constituents,*This rese.

Themost complete description of the ordering principles, especially ofthe conflict between the unmarked order and the topic-commeni,relation, can be found in Lenerz (1977).3.
Imp l i ca t ions  for P rocess ing  Mode lsSyntactic as well as pragmatic information is neededto determine the right word order; the unmarked-order prin-ciple is obviously a syntactic statement, whereas the topic-comment order principle requires access to discourse informa-tion.
?, Sometimes different ordering principles make contradic-tory predictions.
Example (lb) violates the unmarked-orderprinciple; (In) is acceptable ven if dem Mann \[the man\] is thefocus of the sentence~ 3The interaction of ordering variability and pragmatics canbe found in many languages and not only in so-called free-word-order languages.
Consider the following two English sentences:(2a) I will talk to him after lunch about the offer.
(2b) I will talk to him about the offer after lunch.Most semantic frameworks would assign the same truth-conditional meaning to (2a) and (2b), but there are discoursesituations in which one is more appropriate than the other.
(2a)can answer a que~-tion about the topic of a planned afternoonmeeting, but is much less likely to occur after an order to men-tion the offer as soon as possible.
4Formal linguistic theories have traditionally assumed theexistence of rather independent components for syntax, seman-tics, and pragmatics, s Linguistics not only could afford thisidealization but has probably temporarily benefited from it.However, if the idealization is carried over to the computationalimplementation of a framework, it can have adverse effects onthe efficiency of the resulting system.2The heaviness principle requires access to phonological information in ad-dition, but, :~ discussion of this dependence is beyond the scope of thispaper.3Sentences that differ only in their discourse role assignments, e.g.. do notfocus on the same constituent(s}, usually exhibit different sentential stresspatterns.4The claim is not that these sentences are not interchangeable in the men-ti, .n~.d i.<o-,urse ituations under any circumstances.

'mantics and pragmatics.If we as.~ume that a language generation system should beable to generate all grammatical word orders and if we furtherassume that, every generated order should be appropriate to thegiven discourse situation, then a truly nonintegrated system, i.e.,a system whose semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic omponentsapply in sequence, has to be inel~cient.
The syntax will firstgenerate all possibilities, after which the pragmatic omponentwill have to select the appropriate variant.
To do so, this com-ponent will also need access to syntactic information.In an integrated model, much unnecessary work can besaved if the syntax refrains from using rules that introduce prag-matically inappropriate orders.
A truly integrated model candiscard improper parses very early during parsing, thereby con-siderably reducing the amount of syntactic processing.The question of integrating rammatical components i alinguistic problem.
Any reasonable solution for an integrationof syntax and pragmatics has to depend on linguistic findingsabout the interaction of syntactic and pragmatic phenomena.
Anintegrated implementation of any theory that does not accountfor this interaction will either augment he theory or neglect helinguistic facts.By supporting integrated implementations, the frameworkand analysis to be proposed below fulfill an important conditionfor effcient treatment of partially free word order.4.
The  F ramework  and  Syntactic Analysis4.1 Ti le F ramework  of CPSG in ID /LP  FormatThe theory of GPSG is based on the assumption thatnat ural languages can be generated by context-free phrase struc-ture (CF-PS) grammars.
As we know, such a grammar is boundto exhibit a high degree of redundancy and, consequently, isnot the right formalism for encoding many of the linguisticgeneralizations a framework for natural language is expectedto express.
However.
the presumption is that it is possible togive a condensed inductive definition of the CF-PS grammar,which contains various components for encoding the linguisticregt,laritics and which can be interpreted as a metagrammar,i.e.. a grammar for generating the actual CF-PS grammar.A GPSG can be defined as a two-leveJ grammar containinga metagrammar and an object grammar.
The object grammarcombines {CF-PS} syntax and model-theoretic semantics.
Itsrules are ordered triples (n. r. t) where n is an integer (the rulenumber}, r is a CF-PS rule.
and t is the tramlationoft.he rule, itsdenotation represented in some version of intensional logic.
Thetranslation t is actually an operation that maps the translationof the children nodes into the translation of t.he parent.
Thenonterminals of r are complex symbols, subsets of a finite setof syntactic features or - as in the latest version of the theory(Gazd:w and Pullum, 1982) - feature trees of finite size.
Therules o/' the obJect grammar are interpreted as tree-admissabilityconditions.The metagrammar consists of four different kinds of rulesthat are used by three major components to generate the object107grammar in a stepwise fashion.
Figure {3) illustrates the basicstructure of a GPSG metagrammar.

there is a set of banjo rules.

encodesonly information about immediate dominance.
The order ofthe right-hand-side symbols, which are separated in IDRs bycommas, has no significance.Metarule Application, maps \[DR doubles to other IDRdoubles.
For this purpose, metaxules, which are the second kindof rules are applied to basic rules and then to the output ofmetarule applications to generate more IDR doubles.
Metarulesare relations between sets of IDRs and are written as A = B,where A and B are rule templates.
The metarute can be read as:If there is an IDR double of kind A, then there is also an IDRdouble of kind /3.
In each case the rule number is copied from A to /3.
s.Several metarules can apply in the derivation of a singleII)R double; however, the principle of Finite Closure, definedby Thompson (1982}, allows every metarule to apply only oncein the derivational history of each IDR double.
The invocationof this principle avoids the derivation of infinite rule sets, in-6Rule number might he a misleading term for n because this copying :~.ssignsthe s~me integer to the whole class of rules that were derived from the~ame basic rules.
This  rule number propagat ion is a prerequisite for the<iPSG accouht of subcategori2ation.eluding those that generate non-CF, non-CS, and noarecursivelanguagesJ 7Another component maps IDR doubles to IDR triples,which are ordered triples (n,i,t) of a rule number .
,  an IDR i,and a translation t.  The symbols of the resulting IDRs axe fullyinstantiated feature sets (or structures} and therefore identical toobject grammar symbols.
Thus, this component adds semantictranslations and instantiates syntactic features.
The mapping iscontrolled by a third set of rule czten6io, principles includingfeature co-occurrence restrictions, feature def.
ult principles, andan algorithm that assigns the right kind of translation to eachrule on the basis of its syntactic information.The last component of the metagrammar maps the IDRtriples to the rules of the object grammar.
For each IDR tripleall the object grammar triples are generated whose CF-PS rulesconform with the linear precedence(LP) rules, the fourth rule setof the metagrammar.
LP rules are members of the LP relation,a partial ordering on V'r I.I VN.
An LP rule (a,$} is usuallywritten as a < ~/and simply states that a precedes/9 wheneverboth a and d occur in the right-hand-side of the same CF-PSru le .It is the separation of linear precedence from immediatedominance statements in the metagrammar that is referred to.as ID/LP format.
And it is precisely this aspect of the for-malism that.
makes the theory attractive for application to lan-guages with a high degree of word-urder freedom.
The analysispresented in the next section demonstrates the functioning of theformalism and some of its virtues.4.2 The Analysis of German Word OrderUszkoreit (1982a) proposes a GPSG analysis of Germanword order that accounts for the fixed-order phenomena, includ-ing the notoriously difqcult problem of the position of finite andnonfinite verbs.
Within the scope of this paper it is impossible torepeat, the whole set of suggested rules.
A tiny fragment shouldsumce to demonstrate the basic ideas as well as the need formodifications of the framework.Rule (41 is the basic VP ID rule that combines ditransitiveverbs like forms of gebe.
(give) with its two objects:(4} (,5, VP  -- .NP, NP,  V)\[+DATI\[+ACC\]Th,~ rule .~tates that a VP can expand as a dative NP (IOBJ},an attn.-alive NP (DOBJ), and a verb.
Verbs that can occurin dilrnnsitive VPs, like geben (give).
are marked in the lexiconwith the rule number 5.
Nothing has been said about the linearorder of these constituents.
The following metarule supplies a"flat" sentence rule for each main verb VP rule \[+NOM 1standsfor the nominative case, which marks the subject.7F, r ~ d*scu.-sion see Peters and Uszkoreit (1982} and Shieber et M. (1983}.I08(5) VP ~ X ,  V ~ S -.
* NP ,  X ,  V\[-AUX\] \[+NOM\]It generates the rule under (6) from (4):(6) (5, S ---, NP ,  NP ,  NP ,  V)\[+ NOMI\[+DAT\]\[+ACC\]Example (7) gives a German constituent that will be admittedby a PS rule derived from ID rule (6):(7} der Doktor dem Mann die Pille gegebenthe doctor the man the pill givenI shall not list the rules here that combine the auxiliary halleand the temporal adverb dann with (7) to arrive at sentence (la),since these rules play no role in the ordering of the three nounphrases.
What  is of interest here is the mapping from ID rule (5)to t.he appropriate set of PS rules.
Which LP rules are neededto allow for all and only the acceptable linearizations?The position of the verb is a relatively easy matter: ifit is the finite matrix verb it precedes the noun phrases; in allother cases, it follows everything else.
We have a feature MCfor matrix clause as well as a feature co-occurrence r striction toensure that +MC will always imply +FIN (finite).
Two LP rulesare needed for the main verb:(Sa) +MC < NP(8b) NP <-MCThe regularities that govern the order of the noun phrases canalso be encoded in LP rules, as in (ga)-!ge):(Oa) +NOMINATIVE < +DATIVE(9b) +NOMINATIVE < +ACCUSATIVE(9c) +DATIVE < +ACCUSATIVE(9d) - FOCUS < +FOCUS(9e) +PRONOUN < -PRONOUN(Kart.tunen and Peters, 1979) 8or a function from discourse situa-tions to the appropriate truth-conditional meaning in the spiritof Barwise and Perry (1981).
The analysis here is not concernedwith choosing a formalism for an extended semantic omponent,but rather with demonstrating where the syntax has to providefor those elements of discourse information that influence thesyntactic structure directly.Note, that the new LP rules do not resolve the problemof ordering-principle conflicts, for the violation of one LP rule isenough to rule out an ordering.
On the other hand, the absenceof these LP rules would incorrectly predict that all permutationsare acceptable.
The next section introduces a redefinition of LPrules that provides a remedy for this deficiency.4.3 The  Modi f ied F rameworkBefore introducing a new definition of LP rules, let mesuggest, anot.her modification that will simplify things somewhat.The I,P rules considered so far are not really LP rules in the sensein which they were defined by their originators.
After all.
LPrules are defined as members of a partial ordering on "v~,?
U VT'.Our rules are schemata for LP rules at best, abbreviating thehuge set of UP rules that are instantiations of these schemata.This definition is an unfortunate one in several respects.
Itnot.
only creates an unnecessarily large set of rules IVN con-tains thousands of fully instantiated complex symbols) but alsosuppresses some of the important generalizations about the lan-guage.
Clearly, one could extract the relevant generalizationseven from a fully expanded LP relation, e.g., realize that there isno LP rule whose first element has -MC and its second elementNP.
However, it should not be necessary to extract generaliza-tions from the grammar; the grammar should express thesegeneralizat.ions directly.
Another disadvantage follows from thechoice of a procedure for arriving at the fully expanded LP rela-Lion.
Should all extensions that are compatible instantiationsof (Sa), (Sb).
and (9a)-(9e} be LP rules: If so.
then (10) is aninstantiat.ion of (8a):(I0) +MC' NP+DEF < +F IN,.\ feature FOCUS has been added that designates a focused con-sf it,eat.
Despite its name FOCUS is a syntactic'fcature, justifiedby syntactic Pacts, such as its influence on word order.
Thissyntactic feature needs t,o be linked with the appropriate dis-course information.
The place to do this is in the rule exteu-sioq component, where features are instantiated and semantictranslations added to ID rules.
It is assumed that in so doingthe translation part of rules will have to be extended anyway soas to incorporate non-truth-conditional aspects of the meaning.For example, the full translation could be an ordered pair oftruth-conditional nd non-truth-conditional content, extendingKarttunen and Peters's treatment of conventional implicatureYet nothing can be a matrix verb and definite simultaneously,and NPs cannot be finite.
(101 is a vacuous rule.
Whetheril is a LP rule at all will depend on the way the nonterminalvocabulary of the object grammar is defined.
If it only includesthe nonterminals that actually occur in rules then (10) is notas LP rule.
\[n this case we would need a component of themetagrammar, the feature instantiation principles, to determine8T,~ be more precise.
Karttunen and Peters actuaJly make their transla-ti,,ns ordered triples of truth-conditiona.l content, impllcatures, and an in-hcrhance expression that plays a role in h~.ndling the projection problemfor presuppositions.109another compouent of the metagrammar, the LP component.
9LP will be redefined as a partial order on 2 p, where F is the setof syntactic features I0The second and more important change can best bedescribed by viewing the LP component as a function from a pairof symbols (which can be characterized as feature sets) to truthvalues, telling us for every pair of symbols whether the first canprecede the second in a linearized ru!e.
Given the LP relation{(al,~/t),(a~,B~.)

A c,~ wherec~ ---- ~(~;  _C 6 A #; C: 3')for 1 < i < n~,Ve call the conjunct clauses LP conditions; the whole con-junction is a complex LP condition.
The complex LP condi-tion allows "T to precede /~ on the right-hand side of a CF-PS rule if every LP condition is true.
An LP condition ctderived from the LP rule (a~,//i) is true if it is not the casethat 3 has the features ;/~ and 6 has the features a?.
Thusthe LP rule NP < VP stanch for the following memberof the LP relation {{+N, -V ,  +2B~R}, l -N ,  +V, +2BAR}).The LP condition following from this rule prevents a su-perset of {-N,  +V, +2BAR} from preceding a superset ofl -N,  +V,  +2BAR},  i.e., a VP  from preceding an NP.But notice that there is nothing to prevent us from writinga fictitious LP rule such as(12} +PRONOUN < -ACCUSATIVEGerman has verbs like Ichrcn that take two accusative nounphr~.ses as complements.
If {12) were an LP rule then the result-ing LP condition defined as in ( l 1 ) would rule out any occurrenceof two prouominalized sister NPs because ither order would berejected.l 1It.
is an empirical question if one might ever find it usefulto write LP rules as in (12}, i.e., rules a < ~/, where a U 3could be a ~ubset of a complex symbol.
Let me introduce aminor redefinition of the interpretation of LP, which will takecare of cases such as (12) and at the same prepare the way fora more substantial modification of LP rules.
LP shall again beinterpreted as a function from pairs of feature sets (associatedwith complex symbols} to truth values.
Given the LP relation{(a1,,'Jl),(oo..;\]'.,} .
.

.
.
(a.,~q~) and a pair of complex symbols0The widety uscd notation for nomnstantiated LP rules and the feature in-stantiati,,n principles could be regarded an meta, met.Lgrammatical devicesthat inductively define a part of"the metagrammar.10Remember that, in an .~-synta.x.
syntactic ategories abbreviate f aturesets NP ~ {+N, -V, +2BAR}.
The definition can emily be extendedto work on feature trees instead of feature sets.1 lln principle, there is nothing in the original ID/LP definition either thatwould prevent the grammar writer from abbreviating a set of LP rules by(121.
It is not quite clear, however, which set of LP rules is abbreviatedby (r").
(3',/~), the function can be expressed as in (13).
(13) ct A c2, A ... A cn where~, - (a~c6 A B~C3, ) - (o~C3,  A B, C6)for l < i < nThat means 3' can precede 6 if all LP conditions are true.For instance, the LP condition of LP rule (12) will yield falseonly if "t is +ACCUSATIVE and # is +PRONOUN, and either3, is -PRONOUN or 6 is -ACCUSATIVE (or both).- Now let.
us assume that, in addition to the kind of simpleLP rules just introduced, we can also have complex LP rules con-sisting of several simple LP rules and notated in curled bracketsa.s in (14}:{14) '+NOMINATIVE < +DATIVE \]+NOMINATIVE < +ACCUSATIVE|+DATIVE < +ACCUSATIVE~-FOCUS < +FOCUS |+PRONOUN < -PRONOUN /The LP condition associated with such a complex LP ruleshall be the disjunction of the LP conditions assigned to itsmembers.
LP rules can be generally defined as sets of orderedpairs of feature sets {(at ,Bt ) , (a~,~)  .
.
.
.
.
(am,~/m)}, which areeither notated with curled brackets as in (10), or, in the case ofsingletons, as LP rules of the familiar kind.
A complex LP rule{{at, dl), (no_, %) .

Any of the atomic LPrules within the complex LP rule can be violated as long as theviolations are sanctioned by at least one of the atomic LP rules.Notice that with respect o this definition, "regular" LPrules, i.e., sing{elons, can be regarded as a speciaJ case of complexI,P rules.\[ want ?o suggest that the LP rules in {Sa}, (8h), and (l-I}arc a subset of the LP rules of German.
This analysis makes anumber of empirical predictions.
For example, it predicts that(15) and (16) are grammatical, but not (17).
(15) Dann batte der Doktor dem Mann die Pille gegeben-FOCUS +FOCUS -FOCUS+NOM +DAT +ACCThen had the doctor the man the pill given(18) Dana hatte der Doktor die Pille dem Mann gegeben-FOCUS +FOCUS +FOCUS+NOM - +ACC +DATThen had the doctor the pill the man given(17)?
?Dann hatte der Doktor die Pille dem Mann gegeben-FOCUS +FOCUS -FOCUS+NOM +ACC +DATThen had the doctor the pill the man givenii0In (17) the sub-LP-rules +DAT < +ACC and -FOCUS <+FOCUS are violated.
No other sub-LP-rule legitimizes theseviolations and therefore the sentence is bad.This agrees with the findings of Lenerz (1977), who testeda large number of sample sentences in order to determine theinteraction of the unmarked syntactic order and the orderingpreferences introduced by discourse roles.
There are too manypossible feature iustantiatious and permutations of the threenoun phrases to permit making grammaticality predictions herefor a larger sample of ordering variants.
So far 1 have notdiscovered any empirical deficiencies in the proposed analysis.5.
Imp l i ca t ions  for Imp lementat ionsThe theory of GPSG, a,s described by its creators and asoutlined in this paper, cannot be used directly for implementa-tion.
The number of rules generated by the metagrammar is justtoo large.
The Hewlett-Packard system (Gawron etal .
,  1982} aswell as Henry Thompson's program, which are both based on apre-ID/LP version of GPSG, use metarules as metagrammaticaldevices, but with feature iustantiation built into the processor.Agreement checks, however, which correspond to the work ofthe metagrammatical feature instantiation principles, are doneat parse time.
As Berwick and Weinberg (1982\] have pointedout, the cont ext-freeness of a grammar might not accomplishmuch when the number of rules explodes.
The more componentsof the metagrammar that can be built into the processor (orused by it as additional rule sets at parse time), the smaller theresulting grammar will be.
The task is to search for parsingalgorithms that.
incorporate the work of the metagrammar intocontext-free phrase structure parsing without completely losingthe parsing time advantages of the latter.
Most PSG parsers dofeature handling at parse time.
Recently, Shieber (forthcoming)has extended the Earley algorithm (Earley 1970) to incorporatethe linearization process without a concomitant loss in parsingc~ciency.
The redefinition of the LP component proposed inthis paper can be int rusted easily and efficiently into Shieber'sextension.If the parser uses the disjunctive LP rules to accept all or-dering variants that are well-formed with respect o a discourse,there still remains the question of how the generator choosesamong the disjuncts in the LP rule.
It would be very surprisingif the different orderings that can be obtained by choosing oneLP rule disjua:t over another did in fact occur with equal fre-quency.
Although there are no clear results that might providean answer to this question, there are indications that certain dis-juntas "win out" more often than others.
However, this choiceis purely stylistic.
A system that is supposed to produce high-quality output might contain a stylistic selection mechanism thatavoids repe, hions or choose~ among variants according to thetyt:e of text or dialogue.6.
Conc lus ionThe proposed analysis of partially free word order inGerman makes the accurate predictions about the gram-musicality of ordering variants, including their appropriate-ness with respect to a given diseo~se.
The 1D/LP format,which has the mechanisms to handle free word order, has beenextended to account for the interaction of syntax and prag-mat.its, as well as for the mutually competing ordering principles.The modifications are compatible with efficient implementationmodels.
The redefined LP component can be used for the im-plementation of stylistic choice.ReferencesBarwise, J. and J.
