Features and AgreementSam Bayer  and  Mark  Johnson*Cogn i t ive  and  L ingu is t i c  Sc iences,  Box  1978Brown Un ivers i ty{ b ayer ,mj  } @cog.brown.eduAbst ractThis paper compares the consislency-based account of agreement phenomenain 'unification-based' grammars with animplication-based account based on a sim-ple feature extension to Lambek Catego-rim Grammar (LCG).
We show that theLCG treatment accounts for constructionsthat have been recognized as problematicfor 'unification-based' treatments.1 In t roduct ionThis paper contrasts the treatment of agreementphenomena in standard complex feature structureor 'unification-based' grammars uch as HPSG (Pol-lard and Sag, 1994) with that of perhaps the sim-plest possible feature extension to Lambek Catego-rial Grammar (LCG) (Lambek, 1958).
We iden-tify a number of situations where the two accountsmake different predictions, and find that gener-ally the LCG account is superior.
In the pro-cess we provide analyses for a number of construc-tions that have been recognized as problematic for'unification-based' accounts of agreements (Zaenenand Karttunen, 1984; Pullum and Zwicky, 1986; In-gria, 1990).
Our account builds on the analysis ofcoordination in applicative categorial grammar inBayer (1994) and the treatment of Boolean connec-tives in LCG provided by Morrill (1992).
Our anal-ysis is similiar to that proposed by Mineur (1993),but differs both in its application and details.The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
Thenext section describes the version of LCG we use inthis paper; for reasons of space we assume familiar-ity with the treatment of agreement in 'unification-based' grammars, see Shieber (1986) and Pollardand Sag (1994) for details.
Then each of the follow-*We would like to thank Bob Carpenter, Pauline Ja-cobson, John Maxwell, Glynn Morrill and audiences atBrown University, the University of Pennsylvania ndthe Universit?t Stuttgart for helpful comments on thiswork.
Naturally all errors remain our own.ing sections up to the conclusion discusses an impor-tant difference between the two approaches.2 Features  in  Lambek Categor ia lGrammarIn LCG semantic interpretation and long distancedependencies are handled independently of the fea-ture system, so agreement phenomena seem to bethe major application of a feature system for LCG.Since only a finite number of feature distinctionsneed to be made in all the cases of agreement weknow of, we posit only a very simple feature systemhere.
Roughly speaking, features will be treated asatomic propositions (we have no need to separatethem into attributes and values), and a simple cat-egory will be a Boolean combination of such atomic'features' (since we have no reason to posit a re-cursive feature structures either).
In fact we areagnostic as to whether more complex feature sys-tems for LCG are linguistically justified; in any eventDorre et.
al.
(1994) show how a full attribute-valuefeature structure system having the properties de-scribed here can be incorporated into LCG.Following the standard formulation of LCG, weregard the standard LCG connectives '/' and 'V asdirected implications, so we construct our system sothat a//~ fl~ can combine to form a if fl' is logicallystronger than/~.Formally, we adopt Morrill's treatment (Morrill,1992) of the (semantically impotent) Boolean con-nectives '^' and 'v' (Morrill named these 'lq' and '11'respectively).
Given a set of atomic features 5 ,  wedefine the set of feature terms 7- and categories gas follows, where '/' and 'V are the standard LCGforward and backward implication operators.7- ::= Y= + 7-^7- + 7-v7-C ::= 7- + C/C + C\?In general, atomic categories in a standard catego-rim grammar will be replaced in our analyses withformulae drawn from 7-.
For example, the NP Kimmight be assigned by the lexicon to the categorynp^sg^3, the verb sleeps to the category s\npnsg^3,70and the verb slept (which does not impose personor number features on its subject) to the categorys\np.To simplify the presentation of the proofs, we for-mulate our system in natural deduction terms, andspecify the properties of the Boolean connectives us-ing the single inference rule P, rather than providingseparate rules for each connective.~P  where I- in the calculus.

For example, since Kimis assigned to the category np^sgA3, then by rule Pit will belong to np as well.Finally, we assume the standard LCG introduc-tion and elimination rules for the directed implica-tion operators.A/B  B B A \BA /~ A\[B\]" \[B\] nA AA/B  ~in A \B  \i~For example, the following proof of the well-formedness of the sentence Kim slept can be derivedusing the rules just given and the lexical assignmentsdescribed above.Kimnp^sg^3 sleptP up s\np8This example brings out one of the fundamental dif-ferences between the standard treatment of agree-ment in 'unification-based' grammar and this treat-ment of agreement in LCG.
In the 'unification-based'accounts agreement is generally a symmetric rela-tionship between the agreeing constituents: bothagreeing constituents impose constraints on a sharedagreement value, and the construction is well-formediff these constraints are consistent.However, in the LCG treatment of agreement pro-posed here agreement is inherently asymmetric, in1Because conjunction and disjunction are the onlyconnectives we permit, it does not matter whether weuse the classical or intuitionistic propositional calcu-lus here.
In fact, if categories uch as np and ap are'decomposed' into the conjunctions of atomic features+nounA--verb and q-noun^+verb respectively as in theSag et.
at.
(1985) analysis discussed below, disjunctionis not required in any of the LCG analyses below.
How-ever, Bayer (1994) argues that such a decomposition isnot always plausible.that an argument must logically imply, or be sub-sumed by, the antecedent of the predicate it com-bines with.
Thus in the example above, the ruleP could be used to 'weaken' the argument fromnpAsgA3 to rip, but it would not allow np (with-out agreement features) to be 'strengthened' to, say,npA SgA 3.Abstracting from the details of the feature sys-tems, we can characterize the 'unification-based' ap-proach as one in which agreement is possible be-tween two constituents with feature specifications ?and ?

and ?
are consistent, whereas the LCGapproach requires that the argument ?

More precisely, say thata formula ?

To see this, notethat because ?

We focus on co-ordination phenomena because this is the one areaof the grammar where underspecified agreement fea-tures seem to play a crucial linguistic role, and can-not be regarded merely as an abbreviatory device fora disjunction of fully-specified agreement values.3 Coord inat ion  and  agreementasymmetr iesInterestingly, the analysis of coordination is the oneplace where most 'unification-based' accounts aban-don the symmetric onsistency-based treatment ofagreement and adopt an asymmetric subsumption-based account.
Working in the GPSG frameworkSag et.
al.
(1985) proposed that the features ona conjunction must be the most specific categorywhich subsumes each conjunct (called the general-ization by Shieber (1992)).
Shieber (1986) proposeda weaker condition, namely that the features on theconjunction must subsume the features on each con-junct, as expressed in the annotated phrase struc-71VPbec~rae wealthy and a Republicanwealthy a Republicanand np ap P became npvap eonj npvapvp/npvap npvapvpFigure 2: The LCG analysis of (2b).,pGOFigure 1: The feature structure subsumption analy-sis of (2b).ture rule below (Shieber, 1992).2 In all of the exam-pies we discuss below, the features associated witha conjunction is the generalization of the featuresassociated with each of its conjuncts, so our conclu-sions are equally valid for both the generalizationand subsumption accounts of coordination.
(1) Xo , Xl conj X2where X0 E X1 and X0 E X2Consider the sentences in (2).
Decomposing the cat-egories N(oun) and A(djective) into the Boolean-valued features {(noun) = +,(verb) = -}  and{(noun) = +, (verb) = +} respectively, the fact thatbecame can select for either an NP or an AP comple-ment (2a) can be captured by analysing it as subcat-egorizing for a complement whose category is under-specified; i.e., its complement satisfies (noun) = +,and no constraint is imposed on the verb feature.
(2) a. Kim \[v became \] \[hv wealthy \] / \[NP a Re-publican \]b. Kim \[vP \[v became \] lAP wealthy \] and \[NPa Republican \] \]Now consider the coordination in (2b).
Assum-ing that became selects the underspecified category(noun) = +, the features associated with the coor-dination subsume the features associated with eachcoordinate, as required by rule (1), so (2b) has thewell-formed structure shown in Figure 1.On the other hand, a verb such as grew whichselects solely AP complements (3a) requires thatits complement satisfies (noun) = +, (verb) = +.Thus the features on the coordinate structure in (3b)must include (verb) = + and so do not subsume the(verb) = - feature on the NP complement, correctlypredicting the ungrammatieality of (3b).

*Kim \[vP \[v grew \] \[hP wealthy \] and \[r~P aRepublican \] \]Our LCG account analyses these constructions ina similar way.
Because the LCG account of agree-ment has subsumption 'built in', the coordinationrule merely requires identity of the conjunction andeach of the conjuncts.A conj ACOACondition: No undischarged assumptionsin any conjunct.
3We provide an LCG derivation of (2b) in Fig-ure 2.
Roughly speaking, rule P allows both theAP wealthy and the NP a Republican to 'weaken' tonpvap, so the conjunction satisfies the antecedent ofthe predicate became.
(This weakening also takesplace in non-coordination examples uch as Kim be-came wealthy).
On the other hand, (3b) is correctlypredicted to be ill-formed because the strongest pos-sible category for the coordination is npvap, but thisdoes not imply the 'stronger' ap antecedent of grew,so the derivation in Figure 3 cannot proceed to forma vp.Thus on these examples, the feature-based sub-sumption account and the LCG of complement co-ordination constructions impose similiar feature con-straints; they both require that the predicate's fea-ture specification of the complement subsumes thefeatures of each of the arguments.
In the feature-based account, this is because the features associ-ated with a conjunction must subsume the features3This condition in effect makes conjunctions into is-lands.
Morrill (1992) shows how such island constraintscan be expressed using modal extensions to LCG.72associated with each conjunct, while in the LCG ac-count the features associated with the complementspecification in a predicate must subsume those as-sociated with the complement itself.Now consider the related construction in (4) in-volving conjoined predicates as well conjoined argu-ments.
Similar constructions, and their relevanceto the GPSG treatment of coordination, were firstdiscussed by Jacobson (1987).
In such cases, thefeature-based subsumption account requires that thefeatures associated with the predicate conjunctionsubsume those associated with each predicate con-junct.
This is possible, as shown in Figure 4.
Thusthe feature structure subsumption account incor-rectly predicts the well-formedness of (4).
(4) *Kim \[ grew and remained \] \[ wealthy and aRepublican \].Because the subsumption constraint in the LCGanalysis is associated with the predicate-argumentrelationship (rather than the coordination construc-tion, as in the feature-based subsumption account),an LCG analysis paralleling the one given in Figure 4does not exist.
By introducing and withdrawing ahypothetical p constituent as shown in Figure 5 itis possible to conjoin grew and remained, but the re-sulting conjunction belongs to the category vp/ap,and cannot combine with the wealthy and a Repub-lican, which belongs to the category npvap.Informally, while rule P allows the features associ-ated with an argument to be weakened, together withthe introduction and elimination rules it permits theargument specifications of predicates to be strength-ened (e.f. the subproof showing that remained be-longs to category vp/ap in Figure 5).
As we re-marked earlier, in LCG predicates are analysed as(directed) implicational formulae, and the argumentfeatures required by a predicate appear in the an-tecedent of such formulae.
Since strengthening theantecedent of an implication weakens the implica-tion as a whole, the combined effect of rule P andthe introduction and elimination rules is to permitthe overall weakening of a category.4 Consistency and agreementComplex feature structure analyses of agreementrequire that certain combinations of feature con-straints are inconsistent in order to correctly reflectagreement failure.
For example, the agreement fail-ure in him runs is reflected in the inconsistency oftheconstraints (case) = acc and (case) = nora.
In theLCG account presented above, the agreement fail-ure in him runs is reflected by the failure of acc toimply nora, not by the inconsistency of the featuresacc and nora.
Thus in LCG there is no principledreason not to assign a category an apparently con-tradictory feature specification such as np^nom^acc(this might be a reasonable l xical category assign-ment for an NP such as Kim).COMP =V Vfinder und hilftVPNP~OBJ = + \]FrauenFigure 6: The feature structure subsumption analy-sis of (5c).Consider the German examples in (5), cited byPullum and Zwicky (1986) and Ingria (1990).
Theseexamples show that while the conjunction finder undhilft cannot take either a purely accusative (5a) ordative complement (5b), it can combine with the NPFrauen (5c), which can appear in both accusativeand dative contexts.

Er findet und hilfthe find-ACC and help-DATFrauenwomen-ACC+DATContrary to the claim by Ingria (1990), these exam-ples can be accounted for straight-forwardly usingthe standard feature subsumption-based account ofcoordination.
Now, this account presupposes the ex-istence of appropriate underspecified categories (e.g.,in the English example above it was crucial that ma-jor category labels were decomposed into the fea-tures noun and verb).
Similarly, we decompose thefour nominal cases in German into the 'subcase' fea-tures obj (abbreviating 'objective') and dir (for 'di-rect') as follows.NominativeAccusativeDativeGenetive{(air) = +,  (obj) = -}= +,  (obj) = +}{(air) = - ,  (obj) = +}{(d , r )  = - ,  (ob j )  = -}By assigning the NPs Mh'nner and Kindern the fullyspecified case features hown above, and Frauen theunderspecified case feature (obj) = +, both the fea-ture structure generalization and subsumption ac-counts of coordination fail to generate the ungram-matical (5a) and (hb), and correctly accept (5c), asshown in Figure 6.73VPCOMP -- \ [ V ~, coN, v - 7 1I I-VERB = +7 FVE  = - 1L NOUN=+IJ L I - j I L I -  'j I I  ouN-+ NooN-+grew and remained wealthy and a RepublicanFigure 4: The feature structure subsumption analysis of the ungrammatical (4).remained \[ap\] 1 .pvp/npvap npvap/e wealthy a Republicangrew and vp ap and npvp/ap conj vp/ap /il npvap P conj npvap "Pvp/ap eo npvap eoFigure 5: A blocked LCG analysis of the ungrammatical (4).As in the previous example, the LCG approachdoes not require the case feature to be decom-posed.
However, as shown in Figure 7 it does as-sign the conjunction finder und hilfl to the cat-egory vp/np^ace^dat; hence the analysis requiresthat Frauen be assigned to the 'inconsistent' cat-egory np^accAdat.
Such overspecified or 'inconsis-tent' features may seem ad hoc and unmotivated,but they arise naturally in the formal framework ofMorrill's extended LCG.In fact, they seem to be necessary to obtain alinguistically correct description of coordination iGerman.
Consider the ungrammatical 'double coor-dination' example in (6).
Both the feature structuregeneralization a d subsumption accounts incorrectlypredict it to be well-formed, as shown in Figure 8.
(6) * Er findet und hilft M~nner undhe find-ACC and help-DAT men-ACC andKindernchildren-DATHowever, the LCG analysis systematically distin-guishes between Frauen, which is assigned to the cat-egory npAaccAdat, and Mdnner und Kindern, whichis assigned to the weaker category np^(accvdat).Thus the LCG analysis correctly predicts (6) tobe ungrammatical, as shown in Figure 9.
Thedistinction between the categories npAacc^dat andnp^(accvdat), and hence the existence of the appar-ently inconsistent categories, eems to be crucial tothe ability to distinguish between the grammatical(5c) and the ungrammatical (6).5 Conc lus ionThis paper has examined some of the differencesbetween a standard complex feature-structure ac-count of agreement, which is fundamentally orga-nized around a notion of consistency, and an ac-count in an extended version of LCG, in which agree-ment is fundamentally an asymmetric relationship.We have attempted to show that the LCG accountof agreement correctly treats a number of cases ofcoordination which are problematic for the stan-dard feature-based account.
Although we have notshown this here, the LCG account extends traight-forwardly to the cases of coordination and morpho-logical neutralization discussed by Zaenen and Kar-tunen (1984), Pullum and Zwicky (1986) and In-gria (1990).The nature of an appropriate feature system forLCG is still an open question.
It is perhaps urpris-ing that the simple feature system proposed herecan handle such complex linguistic phenomena, butadditional mechanisms might be required to treatother linguistic onstructions.

Using the LCG account described aboveit is necessary to treat adverbs as ambiguous, assign-ing them to the categories ( \np^sg)\(s\np^sg) and( s\ np^pl) \ ( s\ np^pl).There are several approaches which may eliminatethe need for such systematic ambiguity.
First, if thelanguage of (category) types is extended to permituniversally quantified types as suggested by Mor-rill (Morrill, 1992), then adverbs could be assignedto the single typeVX.
((s\np^X)\(s\np^X)).Second, it might be possible to reanalyse adjunctionin such a way that avoids the problem altogether.For example, Bouma and van Noord (1994) showthat assuming that heads ubcategorize for adjuncts(rather than the other way around, as is standard)permits a particularly elegant account of the doubleinfinitive construction i Dutch.
If adjuncts in gen-eral are treated as arguments of the head, then the'problem' of 'passing features' through adjunctiondisappears.The comparative computational complexity ofboth the unification-based approach and the LCGaccounts is also of interest.
Despite their simplic-ity, the computational complexity of the kinds offeature-structure and LCG grammars discussed hereis largely unknown.
Dorre et.
al.
(1992) showedthat the satisfiability problem for systems of feature-structure subsumption and equality constraints iundecidable, but it is not clear if such problemscan arise in the kinds of feature-structure gram-mars discussed above.
Conversely, while terminat-ing (Gentzen) proof procedures are available for ex-tended LCG systems of the kind we presented here,none of these handle the coordination schema, andas far as we are aware the computational proper-ties of systems which include this schema re largelyunexplored.ReferencesSamuel Bayer.
