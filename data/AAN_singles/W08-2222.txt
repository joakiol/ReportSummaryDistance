Wide-Coverage SemanticAnalysis with BoxerJohan BosUniversity of Rome ?La Sapienza?
(Italy)email: bos@di.uniroma1.itAbstractBoxer is an open-domain software component for semantic analysis oftext, based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) and DiscourseRepresentation Theory (DRT).
Used together with the C&C tools, Boxerreaches more than 95% coverage on newswire texts.
The semantic repre-sentations produced by Boxer, known as Discourse Representation Struc-tures (DRSs), incorporate a neo-Davidsonian representations for events,using the VerbNet inventory of thematic roles.
The resulting DRSs canbe translated to ordinary first-order logic formulas and be processing bystandard theorem provers for first-order logic.
Boxer?s performance onthe shared task for comparing semantic represtations was promising.
Itwas able to produce complete DRSs for all seven texts.
Manually in-specting the output revealed that: (a) the computed predicate argumentstructure was generally of high quality, in particular dealing with hardconstructions involving control or coordination; (b) discourse structuretriggered by conditionals, negation or discourse adverbs was overall cor-rectly computed; (c) some measure and time expressions are correctlyanalysed, others aren?t; (d) several shallow analyses are given for lexicalphrases that require deep analysis; (e) bridging references and pronounsare not resolved in most cases.
Boxer is distributed with the C&C toolsand freely available for research purposes.277278 Bos1 IntroductionBoxer is an open-domain tool for computing and reasoning with semantic represen-tations.
Based on Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), Boxeris able to construct Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs for short, informallycalled ?boxes?
because of the way they are graphically displayed) for English sen-tences and texts.
There is a translation from DRSs to first-order formulas, whichopens the way to perform inference by including automated reasoning tools such astheorem provers and model builders (Blackburn and Bos, 2005).2 Theory2.1 Combinatory Categorial GrammarAs a preliminary to semantics, we need syntax.
Boxer implements a syntax-semanticsinterface based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar, CCG (Steedman, 2001).
CCGlends itself extremely well for this task because it is lexically driven and has only few?grammar?
rules, and not less because of its type-transparency principle, which saysthat each syntactic type (a CCG category) corresponds to a unique semantic type (alambda-expression).
Because the syntax-semantics is clearly defined, the choice oflogical form can be independent of the categorial framework underlying it.
Steedmanuses simple predicate argument structures expressed via the untyped lambda calculusto illustrate the construction of logical forms in CCG (Steedman, 2001).
We insteadopt for Discourse Representation Theory, a widely accepted sophisticated formal the-ory of natural language meaning dealing with a large variety of semantic phenomena.2.2 Discourse Representation TheoryDRT is a formal semantic theory originally designed by Kamp to cope with anaphoricpronouns and temporal relations (Kamp, 1981).
DRT uses an explicit intermediatesemantic representation, called DRS (Discourse Representation Structure), for deal-ing with anaphoric or other contextually sensitive linguistic phenomena such as ellip-sis and presupposition.
We choose DRT because it has established itself as a well-documented formal theory of meaning, covering a number of semantic phenomenaranging from pronouns, abstract anaphora, presupposition, tense and aspect, proposi-tional attitudes, to plurals (Kamp and Reyle, 1993; Asher, 1993; Van der Sandt, 1992).In terms of expressive power, three different kinds of representations are distin-guished in Boxer:1.
Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs)2.
Underspecified DRSs (DRSs + merge + alfa)3.
?-DRSs (UDRSs + lambda + application)DRSs are the representations corresponding to natural language sentences or texts.This is the core DRT language compatible with first-order logic.
The DRS languageemployed by Boxer is a subset of the one found in Kamp and Reyle (1993).
We definethe syntax of DRSs below with the help of Backus-Naur form, where non-terminalsymbols are enclosed in angle brackets.
The non-terminal <ref> denotes a discoursereferent, and <symn> an n-place predicate symbol.Wide-Coverage Semantic Analysis with Boxer 279<expe> ::= <ref><expt> ::= <drs><drs> ::=<ref>?<condition>?<condition> ::= <basic> |<complex><basic> ::= <sym1>(<expe>) |<sym2>(<expe>,<expe>) |<named>(<expe>,<nam>,<sort>)<complex> ::= ?<expt> |<expt>?<expt> |<expt>?<expt> |<ref>:<expt>DRSs are structures comprising two parts: 1) a set of discourse referents; and 2) aset of conditions constraining the interpretation of the discourse referents.
Conditionscan be simple properties of discourse referents, express relations between them, or becomplex, introducing (recursively) subordinated DRSs.The standard version of DRT formulated in Kamp & Reyle incorporates a David-sonian event semantics (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), where discourse referents can alsostand for events and be referred to by anaphoric expressions or constrained by tem-poral relations.
The neo-Davidsonian system, as implemented in Boxer, uses the in-ventory of roles proposed by VerbNet (Kipper et al, 2008), and has some attractiveformal properties (Dowty, 1989).
There is only one way to state that an individual isparticipating in an event?namely by relating it to the event using a binary relationexpressing some thematic role.
Furthermore, the approach clearly distinguishes theparticipants of an event by the semantic roles they bear.
Finally, it also allows us tocharacterize the meaning of thematic roles independently of the meaning of the verbthat describes the event.We won?t show the standard translation from DRS to FOL here (Blackburn et al,2001; Bos, 2004; Kamp and Reyle, 1993).
Intuitively, translating DRSs into first-orderformulas proceeds as follows: each discourse referent is translated as a first-orderquantifier, and all DRS-conditions are translated into a conjunctive formula of FOL.Discourse referents usually are translated to existential quantifiers, with the exceptionof those declared in antecedents of implicational DRS-conditions, that are translatedas universal quantifiers.
Obviously, negated DRSs are translated as negated formulas,disjunctive DRSs as disjunctive formulas, and implicational DRSs as formulas withmaterial implication.Boxer outputs either resolved semantic representations (in other words, completelydisambiguated DRSs), or underspecified representations, where some ambiguities areleft unresolved in the semantic representation.
This level of representation is referredto as underspecified DRS, or UDRS for short.
It is a small extension of the DRSlanguage given in the previous section and is defined as follows:<expt> ::= <udrs><udrs> ::= <drs> | (<expt>;<expt>) | (<expt>?<expt>)Note here that expressions of type t are redefined as UDRSs.
UDRSs are eitherordinarly DRSs, DRSs conjoined by the merge (for which we use the semicolon), or280 BosNP/N: A N/N: record N: date?q.?p.

[merge]?p.x yrecord(y)nn(y,x)date(x);p@xFigure 1: Derivation with ?-DRSs, including ?-conversion, for ?A record date?.
Com-binatory rules are indicated by solid lines, semantic rules by dotted lines.DRS composed by the ?-operator.
The merge conjoins two DRSs into a larger DRS?
semantically the merge is interpretated as (dynamic) logical conjunction.
Merge-reduction is the process of eliminating the merge operation by forming a new DRSresulting from the union of the domains and conditions of the argument DRSso ofa merge, respectively (obeying certain constraints).
Figure 1 illustrates the syntax-semantics interface (and merge-reduction) for a derivation of a simple noun phrase.Boxer adopts Van der Sandt?s view as presupposition as anaphora (Van der Sandt,1992), in which presuppositional expressions are either resolved to previously estab-lished discourse entities or accommodated on a suitable level of discourse.
Van derSandt?s proposal is cast in DRT, and therefore relatively easy to integrate in Boxer?ssemantic formalism.
The ?-operator indicates information that has to be resolved inthe context, and is lexically introduced by anaphoric or presuppositional expressions.A DRS constructed with ?
resembles the proto-DRS of Van der Sandt?s theory of pre-supposition (Van der Sandt, 1992) although they are syntactically defined in a slightlydifferent way to overcome problems with free and bound variables, following Bos(2003).
Note that the difference between anaphora and presupposition collapses inVan der Sandt?s theory.The types are the ingredients of a typed lambda calculus that is employed to con-struct DRSs in a bottom-up fashion, compositional way.
The language of lambda-Wide-Coverage Semantic Analysis with Boxer 281DRSs is an extension of the language of (U)DRS defined before:<expe> ::= <ref> | <vare><expt> ::= <udrs> | <vart><exp?> ::= (<exp??,?
?> @ <var?>) | <var?><exp??,?
?> ::= ?<var?>.<exp?> | <var??,?
?>Hence we define discourse referents as expressions of type e, and DRSs as expres-sions of type t. We use @ to indicate function application, and the ?-operator to bindfree variables over which we wish to abstract.3 Practice3.1 PreprocessingThe input text needs to be tokenised with one sentence per line.
In the context of thispaper, Boxer was put into action after using a combined processing pipeline of theC&C tools consisting of POS-tagging, named entity recognition, and parsing (Curranet al, 2007).
The POS tags are used to specify the lexical semantics for ambigu-ous CCG categories (see below); the named entity tags are transferred to the level ofDRSs as well and added as sorts to named discourse referents.
An example of a CCGderivation is shown in Figure 2.a virus--[lex] --[lex]by np:nb/n n---------------------[lex] -----------[fa]Cervical cancer caused ((s:pss\np)\(s:pss\np))/np np:nb---[lex] --[lex] ---[lex] --------------------------------------[fa]n/n n is s:pss\np (s:pss\np)\(s:pss\np)------------[fa] ----------------[lex] -----------------------------------------------[ba]n (s:dcl\np)/(s:pss\np) s:pss\np------------[tc] ---------------------------------------------------------------------[fa]np s:dcl\np--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[ba]s:dclFigure 2: CCG derivation as generated by the C&C tools3.2 LexiconIn CCG, the syntactic lexicon comprises the set of lexical categories.
CCGbank hostsmore than a thousand different categories.
The semantic lexicon defines a suitablemapping from categories to semantic representations.
In the context of Boxer, thesesemantic representations are defined in the shape of lambda-DRSs.
Boxer implementsalmost all categories employed by the C&C parser, which is a subset of the ones foundin CCGbank, leaving out extremely rare cases for the sake of efficiency.Defining the lexical semantics cannot always be done solely on the basis of thecategory, for one lexical category could give rise to several different semantic inter-pretations.
So we need to take other resources into account, such as the assigned partof speech (PoS), and sometimes the wordform or named entity type associated withthe category.
For the majority of categories, in particular those that correspond to282 Bosopen-class lexical items, we also need access to the morphological root of the wordthat triggered the lexical category.Although there is a one-to-one mapping between the CCG categories and semantictypes ?
and this must be the case to ensure the semantic composition process pro-ceeds without type clashes ?
the actual instantiations of a semantic type can differeven within the scope of a single CCG category.
For example, the category n/n cancorrespond to an adjective, a cardinal expression, or even common nouns and propernames (in the compound expressions).
In the latter two cases the lexical entry intro-duces a new discourse referent, in the former two it does not.
To account for thisdifference we also need to look at the part of speech that is assigned to a token.3.3 ResolutionBoxer implements various presupposition triggers introduced by noun phrases, includ-ing personal pronouns, possessive pronouns, reflexive pronouns, emphasising pro-nouns, demonstrative pronouns, proper names, other-anaphora, definite descriptions.In addition, some aspects of tense are implemented as presupposition triggers, too.Anaphora and presupposition resolution takes place in a separate stage after build-ing up the representation, following the resolution algorithm outlined in Bos (2003).The current implementation of Boxer aims at high precision in resolution: personalpronouns are only attempted to be resolved to named entities, definite descriptionsand proper names are only linked to previous discourse referents if there is overlap inthe DRS-conditions of the antencedent DRS and alpha-DRS.
If no suitable antecedentcan be found, global accommodation of the anaphoric discourse referent and condi-tions will take palce.Because Boxer has the option to output unresolved DRSs too, it is possible to in-clude external anaphora or coreference resolution components.3.4 Example AnalysisWe illustrate the capabilities of Boxer with the following example text shown below(aka as Text 2 of the shared task).1 The text consists of three sentences, the second be-ing a coordinated sentence.
It contains a passive construction, three pronouns, relativeclauses, control verbs, and a presupposition trigger other.Text 2Cervical cancer is caused by a virus.
That has been known for some timeand it has led to a vaccine that seems to prevent it.
Researchers have beenlooking for other cancers that may be caused by viruses.The output of Boxer for this text is shown in Figure 3.
Only the box format is shownhere?
Boxer is also able to output the DRSs in Prolog or XML encodings.
It was runwithout analysing tense and aspect and without discourse segmentation (both of theseare possible in Boxer, but still undergo development, and are therefore disregardedhere).As we can see from the example and Boxer?s analysis various things go right andvarious things go wrong.
Boxer deals fine with the passive construction (assigned the1This text was taken from the Economist Volume 387 Number 8582, page 92.
The third sentence hasbeen simplified.Wide-Coverage Semantic Analysis with Boxer 283appropriate semantic role), the relative clauses, and the control construction (vaccineis the agent of the prevent event).
It also handles the presupposition trigger anaphori-cally linking the mention of other cancers in the third sentence with the phrase cervi-cal cancer in the first sentence, and asserting an inequality condition in the DRS.Boxer failed to resolve three pronouns correctly.
These are all accommodated atthe global level of DRS, which is the DRS on the left-hand side in Figure 3.
All of thepronouns have textual antecedents: the abstract pronoun that in the second sentencerefers to the fact declared in the first sentence.
The first occurrence of it in the secondsentence also seems to refer to this fact?
the second occurrence of it refers to cervicalcancer mentioned in the first sentence.bin/boxer --input working/step/text2.ccg --semantics drs --box --resolve --roles verbnet --format no%%% ____________ ______________ ______________ ________________________ _____________________%%% | x0 x1 x2 | | x3 x4 x5 | | x6 x7 | | x8 x9 x10 x11 | | x13 x14 x15 x16 x17 |%%% |------------| |--------------| |--------------| |------------------------| |---------------------|%%% (| thing(x0) |+(| cancer(x3) |+(| know(x6) |+(| lead(x8) |+| researcher(x13) |))))%%% | neuter(x1) | | cervical(x3) | | time(x7) | | vaccine(x9) | | look(x14) |%%% | neuter(x2) | | cause(x4) | | event(x6) | | seem(x10) | | agent(x14,x13) |%%% |____________| | virus(x5) | | theme(x6,x0) | | proposition(x11) | | cancer(x15) |%%% | event(x4) | | for(x6,x7) | | event(x10) | | __________ |%%% | theme(x4,x3) | |______________| | event(x8) | | | | |%%% | by(x4,x5) | | agent(x8,x1) | | __ |----------| |%%% |______________| | agent(x10,x9) | | | | x15 = x3 | |%%% | theme(x10,x11) | | |__________| |%%% | to(x8,x9) | | cause(x16) |%%% | _______________ | | virus(x17) |%%% | | x12 | | | event(x16) |%%% | x11:|---------------| | | theme(x16,x15) |%%% | | prevent(x12) | | | by(x16,x17) |%%% | | event(x12) | | | for(x14,x15) |%%% | | agent(x12,x9) | | | event(x14) |%%% | | theme(x12,x2) | | |_____________________|%%% | |_______________| |%%% |________________________|Attempted: 3.
Completed: 3 (100.00%).Figure 3: Boxer output for Shared Task Text 24 Performance on Shared TaskHere we discuss the output of Boxer on the Shared Task Texts (Bos, 2008).
Boxer wasable to produce semantic representation for all text without any further modificationsto the software.
For each text we briefly say what was good and bad about Boxer?sanalysis.
(We won?t comment on the performance on the second text, as this is thetext proposed by ourselves and already discussed in the previous section.
)Text 1: An object is thrown with a horizontal speed ...Good: The resulting predicate argument structure was fine overall, including a diffi-cult control construction (?how long does it take the object to fall ...?).
The definitedescription ?the object?
was correctly resolved.
The conditional got correctly anal-ysed.Bad: The measure phrase ?125 m high?
got mis-interpreted as noun-noun comn-pound.
The definite description ?the fall?
was not linked to the falling event mentionedbefore.Comments: Because there were two questions in this text we parsed it using theC&C parser with the model trained on questions.284 BosText 3: John went into a restaurant ...Good: The pronouns were correctly resolved to the proper name ?John?
rather than?the waiter?, even though this is based on the simple strategy in Boxer to link third-person pronouns to named entities of type human.
The coordination construction?warm and friendly?
got correctly analysed (distributively), and the control construc-tion ?began to read his book?
received a proper predicate argument structure.Bad: Boxer doesn?t deal with bridging references introduced by relational nouns, soexpressions like ?the corner?
were not linked to other discourse entities.Text 4: The first school for the training of leader dogs ...Good: The named entities were correctly recognised and classified (locations andproper names).
The VP coordination in the first and later sentences was correctlyanalysed.
The expression ?this school?
got correctly linked to the schhol mentionedearlier in the text.
The time expression ?1999?
got the right interpretation.Bad: The adjectives/determiners ?first?
and ?several?
didn?t receive a deep analysis.The complex NP ?Joao Pedro Fonseca and Marta Gomes?
was distributively inter-preted, rather than collective.
The pronoun ?they?
wasn?t resolved.
The preposition?In?
starting the second sentence was incorrectly analysed by the parser.Text 5: As the 3 guns of Turret 2 were being loaded ...Good: The discourse structures invoked by the sentence initial adverbs ?As?
and?When?
was correctly computed.
Predicate argument structure overall good, includ-ing treatment of the relative clauses.
The expression ?the propellant?
was correctlyresolved.
Time expressions in the one but last sentence got a correct analysis.Bad: The name ?Turret 2?
was incorrectly analysed (not as a compound).
The ad-verbs ?yet?
and ?then?
got a shallow analysis.
The first-person pronoun ?I?
was notresolved to the crewman.Comments: The quotes were removed in the tokenisation phase, because the C&Cparser, being trained on a corpus without quotes, performs badly on texts containingquotes.Text 6: Amid the tightly packed row houses of North Philadelphia ...Good: The named entities were correctly recognised and classified as locations.
Thevarious cases of VP coordination all got properly analysed.
The numerical and dateexpressions got correct representations.Bad: The occurrences of the third-person neuter pronouns were not resolved.
Thepreposition ?Amid?
was not correctly analysed.Text 7: Modern development of wind-energy technology and applications ...Good: Correct interpretation of time expressions ?1930s?
and ?1970s?.
Correct pred-icate argument structure overall.Bad: ?Modern?
was recognised as a proper name.
The noun phrase ?wind-energytechnology and applications?
was distributively analysed with ?wind-energy?
only ap-plying to ?technology?.
The sentence-initial adverb ?Since?
did not introduce properdiscourse structure.
The units of measurement in the last two sentences were notWide-Coverage Semantic Analysis with Boxer 285recognised as such.
The tricky time expression ?mid-80?s?
only got a shallow inter-pretation.5 ConclusionBoxer is a wide-coverage system for semantic interpretation.
It takes as input a CCGderivation of a natural language expression, and produces formally interpretable se-mantic representations: either in the form of DRSs, or as formulas of first-orderlogic.
The existence of CCGbank (Hockenmaier, 2003) and robust parsers trainedon it (Clark and Curran, 2004; Bos et al, 2004) make Boxer a state-of-the-art open-domain tool for deep semantic analysis.Boxer?s performance on the shared task for comparing semantic represtations waspromising.
It was able to produce DRSs for all texts.
We can?t quantify the qualityof Boxer?s output, as we don?t have gold standard representations at our disposal.Manually inspecting the output gives us the following impression:?
computed predicate argument structure is generally of good quality, includinghard constructions involving control or coordination;?
discourse structure triggered by conditionals, negation or discourse adverbs isoverall correctly computed;?
some measure and time expressions are correctly analysed, others aren?t;?
several shallow analyses are given for lexical phrases that require deep analysis;?
bridging references and pronouns are not resolved in most cases; but when theyare, they are mostly correctly resolved (high precision at the cost of recall).Finally, a comment on availability of Boxer.
