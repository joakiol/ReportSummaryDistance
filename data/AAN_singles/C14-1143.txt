The maininnovation of our approach is that we leave words without a translation counterpart (which aremostly language-particular function words) unaligned on the word level, and locate and align theappropriate phrases which encapsulate them.
In doing so, we harmonize word-level and phrase-level alignments.
We show that this type of annotation can be performedwith high inter-annotatorconsistency and have both linguistic and engineering potentials.1 IntroductionThe value of human annotated syntactic structures for Statistical Machine Translation has been clearlydemonstrated in string-to-tree (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), tree-to-string(Liu et al., 2006; Liu and Gildea, 2008), and tree-to-tree (Eisner, 2003; Liu et al., 2009; Chiang, 2010)models.
One recurring issue which hampers the utility of syntactic structures is the incompatibility be-tween word alignments and syntactic structures (Denero and Klein, 2007; Fossum et al., 2008; Pauls etal., 2010).
The incompatibility arises because word alignments and syntactic structures are establishedindependently of each other.
In the case of tree-to-tree models, there is also the issue of incompatible par-allel tree structures resulting from divergent syntactic annotation standards that have been independentlyconceived based on monolingual corpora (Chiang, 2010).
In this paper, we report an effort in buildinga Hierarchically Aligned Chinese-English Parallel Treebank (HACEPT) where we manually do word-level and phrase-level alignments simultaneously on parallel phrase-based parse trees.
In this process,we attempt to establish an annotation standard that harmonizes word-level and phrase-level alignments.We also analyze a common incompatibility issue between Chinese-English parallel parse trees exposedin the annotation process, with the goal of solving the issue by semi-automatically revising the trees.In the rest of this paper, we describe how we construct the HACEPT and discuss issues arising in theconstruction process.
In Section 2, we discuss the problems of word alignment done without consideringits interaction with syntactic structures.
In Section 3, we describe our annotation procedure where weperform word-level and phrase-level alignments simultaneously in a coordinated manner, and show howour approach is free of the problems discussed in Section 2.
In Section 4, we report a common incom-patibility issue between parse trees and propose a solution.
We also compare the issue with translationdivergence (Dorr, 1994) and show that they are different in nature and occurrence frequency.
In Section5, we present the results of two experiments we have done on our annotation to show the intuitiveness ofour approach and the linguistic and engineering potentials of our corpus.
We then describe related workin Section 6 and conclude our paper in Section 7.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

The inevitableconsequence of the practice is that both redundancies and incompatibilities between word alignments andsyntactic structures will arise in many places.
In this section, we illustrate the issues through language-particular function words, where the problems are most frequently found.
Due to language-particularidiosyncrasy and lack of lexical content, these function words usually do not have a translation coun-terpart, which presents a great challenge to alignment annotation.
There are two logical possibilities ofdealing with these words, both of which are represented in existing annotation practice.
The first is toleave them unaligned or link them to a fictitious NULL word (Ahrenberg, 2007; Brown et al., 1990), andthe second, which also seems to be the more common pratice, is to attach these function words to a wordthat has a translation counterpart, and then align the function word and its host with the counterpart ofthe host (Melamed, 1998; Li et al., 2009).
For ease of discussion, below we will refer to the latter praticeas the "glue-to-a-host" strategy (GTAHS).
Both approaches are less than desirable: the former leaves thefunction words unaccounted for, and the latter leads to incompatibility issues we discuss in detail below.First note that, by attaching language-particular function words to a host, the GTAHS creates redun-dancies between word alignments and syntactic structures since many of these function words have al-ready been associated with a host within a constituent in the parse tree (e.g., the English determiner theis placed inside the projection of its host, namely an NP).
A more serious issue is that the GTAHS cre-ates spurious ambiguities.
Lexical ambiguity is inevitable in translation.
For instance, the English nounbank has more than one lexical meaning and each of the meanings corresponds to a different Chineseword.
That fact aside, the GTAHS creates spurious ambiguities, which, in our view, would be harmfulto Machine Translation (MT) if extracted as translation rules.
Consider the following example, wherethe Chinese noun??
is aligned to six English strings (aligned elements are underlined):(1) a. eat apples <>???b.
eat an apple <>???c.
eat the apple <>???d.
fond of apples <>????e.
talk about apples <>????f.
provide them with apples <>????
?The English apple and the Chinese??
match in meaning and are both unambiguous.
In cases wherethe English noun is used with a determiner as in (1b) and (1c), since Chinese has no determiners andthe bare noun??
can be the appropriate translation for either an apple or the apple given a context,the GTAHS attaches the determiner to apple and the whole string is aligned with??.
In other similarcases where an English element such as a preposition is absent in Chinese as in (1d), (1e) and (1f), theGTAHS glues the preposition to apple and the whole PP is aligned with ??.
With the GTAHS, theunambiguous Chinese ??
ends up being aligned with more than one English string.
This kind ofspurious ambiguity is very common given the GTAHS.The second issue is that, by attaching function words to a host, the GTAHS effectively creates rudi-mentary syntactic structures, which are often incompatible with the syntactic structures annotated basedon existing treebanking annotation standards.
For example, all the aligned multi-word strings underlinedin (2) do not correspond to a constituent in a Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993) or Chinese TreeBank(Xue et al., 2005) parse tree:(2) a.
If I were him <>???????b.
He is visiting Beijing <>??????1512c.
the beginning of the new year <>????d.
to quickly and efficiently solve the problem <>????????
?Given the incompatibilities between existing word alignments and syntactic structures, in the next sec-tion we describe an approach where we perform word-level and phrase-level alignments simultaneouslyon parallel phrase-based parse trees, attempting to construct a hierarchically aligned corpus where wordalignments are harmonized with syntactic structures.3 Annotation specification and procedureThe data we annotate is the Chinese-English portion of the Parallel Aligned Treebank (PAT) describedin (Li et al., 2012).
Our data consists of two batches, one of which is weblogs and the other of which ispostings from online discussion forums.
The English sentences in the data set are annotated based on theoriginal Penn TreeBank (PTB) annotation stylebook (Bies et al., 1995) as well as its extensions (Warneret al., 2004), while the Chinese sentences in the data set are annotated based on the Chinese TreeBank(CTB) annotation guidelines (Xue and Xia, 2000) and its extensions (Zhang and Xue, 2012).
The PATonly has word alignments, which are done under the GTAHS, and no phrase alignments.The main departure of our approach is that we loosen the requirement that every word in a sentencepair needs to be word-aligned.
On the word level, we only align words that have an equivalent in termsof lexical meaning and grammatical function.
For words that do not have a translation counterpart, weleave them unaligned and locate the appropriate phrases in which they appear to be aligned.
This way, weeliminate both the redundancies and spurious ambiguities discussed in Section 2.
Since phrase alignmentis done between syntactic nodes on parallel parse trees, we also eliminate the incompatibilities betweenword alignments and syntactic structures.
See the discussion of the concrete example in Figure 1 belowto see the points made here.Next we discuss our annotation procedure in detail.
Our annotators are presented with sentence pairsthat come with parallel parse trees.
The task of the annotator is to decide, first on the word level and thenon the phrase level, if a word or phrase needs to be aligned at all, and if so, to which word or phrase itshould be aligned.
The decisions about word alignment and phrase alignment are not independent, andmust obey well-formedness constraints as outlined in (Tinsley et al., 2007):a.
A non-terminal node can only be aligned once.b.
if Node ncis aligned to Node ne, then the descendants of nccan only be aligned to descendants ofne.c.
if Node ncis aligned to Node ne, then the ancestors of nccan only be aligned to ancestors of ne.This means that once a word alignment is in place, it puts constraints on phrase alignments.
A pair ofnon-terminal nodes (nc, ne) cannot be aligned if a word that is a descendant of ncis aligned to a wordthat is not a descendant of neon the word level.Let us use the concrete example in Figure 1 to illustrate the annotation process, which is guided by a setof detailed annotation guidelines.
On the word level, only those words that are connected with a dashedline are aligned since they have equivalents.
Note that the Chinese words?
(a function word used toprepose the object to the left of the verb),??
(an adverb meaning "this way"),?
(a modal meaning"can") and the English discourse connective so that, the auxiliary verb is and the preposition from are allleft unaligned on the word level.
Aligning these function words will generate artificial ambiguous casesand create incompatibilities between word alignments and parse trees that have already been illustratedand discussed in Section 2.
For instance, if?
is to be word-aligned, it would be glued to the noun??
and the whole string???
will be aligned to the English gravity.
Note that both??
and gravityare unambiguous and form a one-to-one correspondence.
With the word alignment between ?
?
?and gravity, we make the unambiguous gravity correspond to both ??
and ?
??

Also note that the string ?
??
does not form aconstituent in the Chinese parse tree, so the word alignment is incompatible with the syntactic structureof the sentence.
By leaving?
unaligned, we avoid both the spurious ambiguity and the incompatibility.With word alignments in place, next the annotator needs to perform phrase alignments.
Note that wordalignments place restrictions on phrase alignments.
For instance, e9and e10will be ruled out as possiblealignments for c10, because?
?, a descendant of c10, is aligned to sludge, which is not a descendant ofeither e9or e10.
By contrast, e3is a possible alignment for c10because the alignment does not violate thewell-formedness constraints.
The annotator then needs to decide whether this possible phrase alignmentcan be actually made.
This is a challenging task since, for a given phrase, there usually are more than onecandidate from which a single alignment needs to be picked.
For instance, for e3, there are in total threepossible phrase alignments, namely c10, c3and c9, all of which obey the well-formedness constraints.Since a non-terminal node is not allowed to be aligned to multiple non-terminal nodes on the other side,the annotator needs to choose one among all the candidates.
This highlights the point that the alignmentof non-terminal nodes cannot be deterministically inferred from the alignment of terminal nodes.
This isespecially true given our approach where some terminal nodes are left unaligned on the word level.
Forinstance, the reason why c9is a possible alignment for e3is because the word??
is left unaligned.
If??
were aligned with so that, c9could not be aligned with e3since so that is not a descendant of e3and aligning the two nodes will violate Constraint b.While Constraints b and c can be enforced automatically given the word alignments, the decisionsregarding the alignment of non-terminal nodes which satisfy Constraint a are based on linguistic consid-erations.
One key consideration is to determine which non-terminal nodes encapsulate the grammaticalrelations signaled by the unaligned words so that the alignment of the non-terminal nodes will effectivelycapture the unaligned words in their syntactic context.
When identifying non-terminal nodes to align,we follow two seemingly conflicting general principles:?
Phrase alignment should not sever key dependencies involving the grammatical relation signaledby an unaligned word.?
Phrase alignment should be minimal, in the sense that the phrase alignment should contain only theelements involved in the grammatical relation, and nothing more.The first principle ensures that the grammatical relation is properly encapsulated in the aligned non-terminal nodes.
For example in Figure 1, if we attach the English preposition from to running and aligningthem to?
?, we would fail to capture the fact that from signals a relation between prohibit and runningdownhill.
Aligning VPc3with Se3captures this relation.The first principle in and of itself is insufficient to produce desired alignment.
Taken to the extreme, itcan be trivially satisfied by aligning the two root nodes of the sentence pair.
We also need the alignmentto be minimal, in the sense that aligned non-terminal nodes should contain only the elements involvedin the grammatical relation, and nothing more.
These two requirements used in conjunction ensure thata unique phrase alignment can be found for each unaligned word.
The phrase alignments (VPc1, VPe1),(VPc2, VPe2), (VPc3, Se3), as illustrated in Figure 1, all satisfy these two principles.In addition to making phrase alignments, the annotator needs to assign labels to phrase alignments.
Wehave four labels that are designed along two dimensions: the presence/absence of word order differenceand the presence/absence of unaligned function words.
The name and definition of each of the four labelsare listed below, and an example for each label is given in Figure 2:a REO, reordering that does not involve unaligned function words (Figure 2a)b UFW, unaligned function words (Figure 2b)c REU, reordering that also involves unaligned function words (Figure 2c)d STD, structural divergence due to cross-linguistic differences (Figure 2d)1515.VP1..VP.VV.??..PP..NP..NP.NN.??..DP.DT.?.P.

In Chinese, the PP modifieris before the verb while in English the PP modifier is after the verb.
The phrase alignment illustratedby Figure 2b has an unaligned function word, namely the English infinitive marker to, which has nocounterpart in Chinese.
There are both reordering (difference in the relative order of powerhouse andeconomy) and unaligned function words (Chinese?
and English of ) in the phrase alignment in Figure2c.
Figure 2d provides an example where the aligned phrases have structural divergence caused by cross-linguistic differences between Chinese and English, which we will discuss in some detail in Section 4.4 A common incompatibility issue between parse treesDuring the annotation process, we encountered some incompatibility issues between parse trees.
Fora comprehensive and detailed discussion of the issues, see (Deng and Xue, 2014).
Here we report themost common issue, which is caused by differences between treebank annotation guidelines.
As alreadymentioned, the English parse trees we use are annotated based on the original PTB annotation stylebook(Bies et al., 1995) as well as its extensions (Warner et al., 2004), while the Chinese parse trees areannotated based on the CTB annotation guidelines (Xue and Xia, 2000) and its extensions (Zhang andXue, 2012).
Since PTB and CTB are independently annotated, there are some differences in how certainstructures are annotated.
The main issue is that certain structures are so flat as to make some nodes thatshould be aligned impossible to be aligned.
In general, our alignment task favors deeper structures overshallower ones so that the annotator can have more choices.
This is an issue for both Chinese and Englishparse trees.
To get a concrete idea of the issue, take a look at Figure 3.As shown by Figure 3, VPc1and the English string probably decrease rapidly with distance, and VPe1and the Chinese string???????
?, cannot be aligned although they match in meaning andshould be aligned.
They cannot be aligned because there is no node for either of the two strings in therespective parse tree.
Note that the incompatibility between the two trees here is due to a difference inannotation style but not a deep cross-linguistic difference.
Both PTB and CTB simplified the annotationtask by making the tree structures flatter to increase annotation speed, but the simplification does notalways come from the same places.
The consequence of these annotation decisions is that relevant struc-tures are sometimes incompatible, which has negatively affected their utility for MT purposes (Chiang,1516.IP..VPc1..VP.VV.??..ADVP.AD.??.ADVP.AD.?.PP..NP.NN.??..P.?.ADVP.AD.??..NP..NP.NN.??.DP..CLP.M.?..DT.
?.S..VPe1..PP..NP.NN.distance..IN.with..ADVP.RB.rapidly.VBP.decrease..ADVP.RB.probably.NP..NNS.benefits..DT.TheFigure 3: Unalignable nodes due to differences in tree representation2010).To solve this incompatibility issue, we need to create more structures through binarization, which canbe done automatically.
Still take Figure 3 for instance, on the English side, if we create a new VP bycombining VPe1and its sister ADVP, the resulting VP can be aligned with VPc1.
On the Chinese side,if we do binarization to create a VP that dominates the string???????
?, VPe1would havean alignment.
Since changing tree structures has the potential risk of causing inconsistency with parsetrees in the original treebanks and had better be done systematically after all the annotation is finished,we have not done binarization as of the writing of this paper.
For the time being, we assign the labelUA (short for Unalignable Node) to nodes which should be aligned but cannot be aligned so that we cangather some statistics on the extent of the problem.
We will come back to revisit the nodes carrying UAsuch as VPc1and VPe1by proposing systematic changes to the original treebanks.The UA case discussed above should not be confused with another case of incompatibility, namelystructural divergence between parallel sentences in translation (Dorr, 1994).
As shown above, UA isbasically an artificial issue that is caused by difference in parsing guideline design and fixable throughautomatic binarization.
Structural divergence arises mainly due to genuine cross-linguistic differences.We provide an example of structural divergence (STD) in Figure 2d.
As shown in the figure, the twoaligned phrases (VP and S) are structurally quite different: the English string is a clause with the NP thesweat as the subject and the VP flowing over me as the predicate (the example is taken out of the sentenceI felt the sweat flowing over me to save space).
The Chinese string is a simple verb phrase where theadverb??
(literally whole-body) modifies the verb??
(literally emerge-sweat).
In terms of meaningcorrespondence,??
expresses the meaning of the English PP over me and the verb matches in meaningwith the sweat flowing.
We have run an experiment on STD and found that the STD cases are pretty rare(on average 5 instances in a file with 500 sentence pairs), indicating that the structural difference betweenChinese and English is not so fundamental as to make a big impact on alignment annotation.15175 Annotation experimentsWe did two experiments on our annotation.
The first is about inter-annotator agreement (IAA), whichis a way of both evaluating the annotation quality and judging the intuitiveness of the annotation task.An unintuitive annotation task would force the annotator to make subjective choices, which would resultin low IAA.
Since the annotation task involves parse trees, ideally we need annotators who are trainedin syntax, but that would put a constraint on the pool of qualified annotators and make it difficult forthe annotation to scale up.
In our annotation experiments, we use four annotators who are fluent in bothEnglish and Chinese but have no prior linguistic training, led by a syntactician who performs the finaladjudication.As of this writing, we have completed the single annotation of 8,932 sentence pairs, 2,500 of whichare double annotated.
The IAA statistics presented in Table 1 are based on the double-annotated 2,500sentence pairs, which are divided into 5 chunks of 500 sentence pairs each.
The statistics are for phrasealignment only, and the micro-average for the 5 chunks is 0.87 (F1), indicating we are able to get goodquality annotation for this task.
In addition, the agreement statistics for the 5 chunks are very stable,even though they are performed by different pairs of annotators, indicating we are getting consistentannotation from different annotators.Table 2 shows the result of the second experiment, namely the distribution of the different types ofphrase alignment.
It shows that alignments that contain unaligned function words outnumber those thatdo not, and that alignments that do not involve reordering outnumber those that do.
It also shows that anoverwhelming number of alignments that involve reordering also have unaligned function words.
Thismeans that the function words are potentially useful "triggers" for reordering, which is an important issuethat MT systems are trying to address.Chunk No.

However, most of the existing parallel treebanks (Li et al.,2012; Megyesi et al., 2010) do not have phrase alignments.
Some (Sulger et al., 2013; Kapanadze, 2012)do have phrase alignments, but neither discussion about the interaction between word-level and phrase-level alignments nor report of IAA is provided.
There have been a few recent attempts at automaticallyaligning subtrees (comparable to our phrases) in the context ofMT research, and the automatic alignmentsare evaluated against a small manually aligned data set.
For example, (Tinsley et al., 2007) evaluatedan unsupervised algorithm on 810 parsed English-French pairs annotated with subtree alignment.
(Xiaoand Zhu, 2013) also developed unsupervised subtree alignment methods (EM and Variational Bayes)and evaluated their automatic alignment model on 637 sentences from the Chinese TreeBank (and usethe other 99 for tuning).
(Sun et al., 2010b; Sun et al., 2010a) also report work on aligning subtreesand evaluate their impact on MT.
However, we are not aware of any attempt to systematically harmonizeword alignment with the alignment of phrases, or subtrees, or to systematically study the incompatibilitiesbetween parallel parse trees.15187 ConclusionIn this paper we report our effort on the construction of a Chinese-English parallel treebank with bothword-level and phrase-level alignments.
When constructing the treebank, we systematically considerthe interaction between word alignments and phrase alignments, and try to harmonize the two kinds ofalignments by removing redundancies and incompatibilities between them.
We show that this type ofannotation can be performed with high inter-annotator consistency.
Given our intention for the treebankto be a resource for MT, the next step is to synchronize the parallel parse trees, and of course, to performautomatic hierarchical alignment experiments and MT experiments.AcknowledgementsThis work is supported by the IBM subcontract No.
