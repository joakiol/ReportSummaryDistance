FAIL-SOFT C"EMERGENCY") MEASURES IN A PRODUCTION-ORIENTED MT SYSTEMEva Haji~ov~ and Zden~k KirschnerFakulty of Mathematics and Physics,Charles UniversityMalostransk4 n.25, 118 OO Praha i, CzechoslovakiaABSTRACTA system of fail-soft (emergency) meas-ures for a production-or iented MT systemis discussed, stating first the specificpurposes of such a system, and showing then,how these measures are being used in thesystem of Engl ish-to-Czech machine trans-lation as prepared by the group of mathe-matical l inguistics at Charles Universityin Prague.i.
In view of a production-or iented systemof machine translation, under the present--day conditions, one should keep in mindthat the end-user expects to have at hisdisposal a complete text rather than an al-ternating sequence of ~sentence) segmentsand blanks.
On the other hand, everyonewho has ever made even a perfunctory lookat the problems involved in MT would agreethat there is no such thing as a "complete"MT system, neither in the dict ionary norin the grammar part of it.
Also, as is com-monly accepted nowadays, any system withtexts written in natural language at theinput should provide measures for some kindof treatment of i l l -formed input.
Thus itis inevitable to consider, first, what typeand quality of translation can meet thedemands of a prospective user and what kindof translat ion is real izable under thegiven conditions, and, second, to decidewhat is to be sacrif iced from, and whatadded to the system to make it work in aproduction enviroment.In the present paper we would like tooutl ine one aspect of the approach takenup at the start of our experiment APAC3-2 -the En@lish-.~-Czech machine translat ionsystem for translat ing INSPEC abstractsfrom the field of microelectronics (for adescr ipt ion of the history of the MT ef-forts of our team, see Haji~ov~, 1986;the APAC series is described in full detai lin Kirschner, 1982; 1984; in press).
Weshould emphasize that in the condit ionswithin our reach, we aim at a satisfacto-r i ly accurate rendering in target languageof the contents of a relat ively simpletext in source language, which would suf-fice for such a system to be appl icable ininformation acquisit ion and would be ca-pable to meet the main requirements set upby average users.2.1 The specific purposes of the systemof fai l-soft C"emergency") measures toovercome anomalous input phenomena andpartial fai lures of the MT system can bestated as follows:- The whole processing is divided intoseveral stages to identify and treat moreprobable interpretations of some structurespreferential ly - to make the "preferential"approach (see below, Sect.2.2) a reality.104The drawback is that in these circumstancesthe danger of a di lemmatic situation result-ing in a cul-de-sac impasse increases.
Aspecial device has been introduced to over-come such an abnormal end: instead of elimi-nating such a defective string, the appllca-tion of the phase in question is suspended -the program processing this string skips thephase and continues in the next one.
Therules that compensate for the lacuna can beeither the rules that in the framework of"preferential" approach take up the roleof their more strict predecessors, or rulesadded particularly for this purpose - todeal with the most undesirable consequencesof such an omission.- In the analysis, the emergency rulesinterpret unrecognized elements and inte-grate them into more complex structures.- In the synthesis, they help to producean output that makes sense, corresponds tothe source language, and is easier to post--edit.- ~henever it is possible, they attemptat forming target language equivalents forthe unidentif ied elements, either by adapt-ing international words or by "czechizing"English dict ionary forms by enduing themwlth qualit ies and forms proper to theirpresumptive Czech counterparts - e.g.,gender, suffixes, etc.- With some classes of words, they serveas general dict ionary rules provided thesets of semantic features, frame informa-tion and other necessary outfit of individ-ual members of these classes correspond tothe standard apparatus assigned to theirrepresentation in the framework of a gen-eral device, and their orthography ensuresforming correct equivalents in Czech.2.2 The fail-soft measures can be charac-terized as consisting of three main parts:the first two concern elements not foundin the basic dict ionaries and the thirdconcerns failures to arrive at an accom-plished parse.
\[We leave aside a discussionof the unif icat ion of orthography - suchas American and Brit ish usage, differentways of spelling, use of hyphens etc.
-which comes before the first device de-scribed here.)
In a sense, there is a setof other rules of "emergency" character:general rules \[which can be called "sweep-ing rules") designed to operate after allmore specific rules failed to apply - e.g.,in the formation of compounds or in nominalsyntax in general, etc.~ however, thisbeing a constitutional component of whatwe call "preferential" approach, we shallconfine ourselves to describing only theformer three sets.
To avoid a possiblemisunderstanding, we should make clearthat when we call our approach "preferen-tial", it is only the name that it has incommon with Wilks" "preferential semantics".In our system, we apply a rather trivialand simple principle with the aid of whichthe different probabi l i ty of interpreta-tion\[s) of some parts of a string is takeninto account and exploited.
The most prob-able solutions are covered by the rulesfirst and with as detai led an accuracy aspossible) the next probable solution isoffered in some of the subsequent phases,etc., under more liberal conditions.
The"sweeping rules" come last.
That is alsothe reason why we write "preferential"with quotation marks.2.21 The first device aimed at intercept-ing and interpreting words that failed tobe found in the basic dict ionaries is theco-called transducing dict ionary (TD).Its task is to interpret the still unre-cognized words according to their typicaland (mostly) productive suffixes (the in-f lectional endings being detached and dic-t ionary forms reconstructed by morphemicanalysis in the preceding steps), and to105assign to them part-ofmspeech and semanticinformation.
Thus, e.g., words ending in-ER, -OR, -GRAPH, -ODE and some others areinterpreted as nouns, concrete, instruments,capable of being substituted for human ac ~tor; words ending in -CS, -CY, -ESS, -TUDEare supposed to be nouns, abstract, prop-erties and, as dist ict from those endingin -ITY, -ICS, -SM, -SHIP, -HOOD, -THM,which otherwise have the same semanticcharacteristics, they form adjectives ina regular manner in Czech; the endings-FY, -ATE, -ISE (-IZE), -DUCE indicateverbs that can be both transit ive and in-transitive, of causative and (semi) termi-nological character,yet not allowed to formadjectices of the purposive type.
A numberof adjectival suffixes is contained, too,viz.
-ARY, -AL, -RSE, -IVE, -OUS, -IC, -BLE,-LESS, -ANARt -LEAR, -NEAR, -OLAR, -ULAR.In all, about 50 classes of nouns, 13 ofadjectives and 4 of verbs are covered bythe TD device.Two further pieces of information shouldbe added, the first being probably super-fluous: i) All words having such suffixesbut different properties as regards theirpart-of-speech category, semantic features,etc., are supposed to be contained in thebasic dictionaries.
2) Most of the classesof words treated by the TD are internation-al words of Latin or Greek origin; theycan easily be "transduced" to Czech by re-latively simple procedures; some of theseprocedures precede the TD operation as apart of a special morphemic analysis, butmost of them operate in the synthesis, asan accessory to the Engl ish - Czech dict ion-ary.
A set of recursively applied rules(in several cycles) takes over the wordsidentified by TD, desintegrates them, re-places the Engl ish suffixes by the corre-sponding Czech ones, and scans the basesfor spell ing configurations to be trans-formed or adapted to Czech orthography(replacing, e.g.
PH by F, TH by T, C pre-ceding A,L,O,R,T,U by K; S preceded by A,E, I ,N,O,R,Y and followed by A,E, I ,O is re-placed by Z, etc.).
Thus, e.g.
PHOTOLITO-GRAPHIC changes into FOTOLITOGRAFICKE2,CYCLOTRON gives CYKLOTRON, ISOSMOTIC istranscribed as IZOSMOTICKE2.
To give anexample of solving similar problems, letus consider the word ISOSEISMIC: to pre-clude the second S situated at a morphemicjuncture from becoming a Z, would requireeither a special entry in the main dict ion-ary - as one word or as combinat ion of theprefixal ISO + SEISMIC, in which case theadjective must be contained in the dict ion-ary - or some similar prel iminary treatmentin the special morphemic analysis precedingthe TD; the latter way of treatment wouldprobably represent the best solution, whichmay be general ized for all or most of thetypical terminological prefixes involvinganalogous problems as IZOSEISMICKE2 - e.g.,A-, INFRA-, PRE-, PERI-, SEMI-, SYN-, MESO-,MONO-, HYPER-, POLY- etc.
(needless to addthat this time it would be such words asISOSMOTIC that would require a specifictreatment, e.g.
to p roce~on ly  SMOTIC -- from ISO + SMOTIC - in the dictionary).It should be remarked that, in principle,this part of the transducing device - or-thographical changes - need not be sepa-rated from the front part operating in theanalysis.2.22 Words that remain unaccounted forafter passing the TD phases - i.e., notfound in the dict ionaries and not belongingto any of the classes dealt with in thetransducing device - are subjected to fur-ther analysis; those having typical verbalinf lectional endings C-ING, -ED) are re-garded as verbs, those ending in -LY aretaken for adverbs provided that more than2 characters precede and their tentativestatus is syntactical ly corroborated.
The106rest are f irst treated as proper namesand if the subsequent analysis  fai ls toc~onfirm this conjecture - i.e., they arenot in?egrated into wider nominal  complexes,e.g., as an apposi t ion - they become nouns(which, by the way, happens to the tenta-t ive adverbs, too).
The words ident i f iedin this tentat ive manner are "czechized",which insome cases might result  in quiteacceptable formations - e.g., if the or ig-inal words can be taken an " internat ional"or technica l ly  and termino log ica l ly  univ-ocal terms: GETTERING --~ GETEROVA2NI2,ABEND --) ABENDOVAT - in other cases inmore or less comical  "macaronic" creat ions.In conclusion, it should be added that theor ig inal  more ambit ious idea of ass ign ingto each unrecognized word ~that does notcarry any character is t ic  clue making theguess easier) three paral le l  tentat ive in-terpretat ions to let the syntact ic  analy-sis decide -noun, verb, adverb - had to beabandoned for reasons similar to those thatled to the res ignat ion in the case of hy-persentent ia l  context.
Too many poss ib i l -ities, often combined with other paral le lsolutions, led to combinator ia l  explos ionthat Cthough often not assuming the char-acter of an inf inite loop) expanded thestructures to such an extent that sooneror later an over f low became inevitable.
Sofar, there is no remedy for over f low inour system.2.23 The last, re lat ive ly  simple, measureconcerns cases where a single parse \[ormore paral le l  single parses) - i.e., treescover ing individual  input str ings - fa i ledto be formed in the last phase of the anal-ysis; usual ly  two or more part ia l  treesare formed instead, which fact may be caus-ed by anomalous structure of the inputstring, or owing to some part ia l  fa i lurein analyz ing one or more substr ings \[e.g.,when some elementCs) or structure\[s~ weremis interpreted) ,  or as a result  of somesubject ive shortcomings in the program -- omission,  error, etc.
The synthesis pro-gram is able to process even such part ialand f ragmentary results  and attempt atcompi l ing an acceptable output, only aspecial  character  (~  or } ) is placed infront of such output  str ings to s ignal izethat they had been formed on the basks ofdefect ive results  of the analysis.
If nec-essary, a set of rules of a more or lessad-hoc character  depr ives "underdone"(sub)trees of all auxi l iary  structuresCcategory labels, parentheses,  separators,features, etc.)
leaving only !exical  valeues, and performs thus the f in ishingtouches to br ing the subst i tute output  asc lose to readable and acceptable resultsas possible.3.
The outputs of indiv idual  phases canbe obta ined in the l ist ing.
Some of thesephases, esp.
the last -but -one phase f ix ingthe state of things before the syntact icmeasures have been appl ied, usual ly  pre-serve informat ion enough to recognize andexamine the unretouched results  and tod ivulge the d iagnosis  of errors or short-comings necessary for further progress.This is to say that most of the "emergen-cy" devices operate at moments and in amanner  which permit  to examine the previ -ous state of things, so that their act iondoes not obscure the regular  course ofthe process ing and al lows normal controlof it.
It should be added that a part ofemergency devices has a temporary charac-ter deal ing with omiss ions and bugs properto the system under development.
We aresure that at least some of them wi l l  be-come superf luons.107REFERENCESHaji~ovA, E. (1986) Machine TranslationResearch in Czechoslovakia, Proceedingsof the Int.Conference on TranslationMechanization, August 20-22, 1986, Co-penhagenKirschner, Z.
