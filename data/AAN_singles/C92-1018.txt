n lAbst rac tRecent theoretical descriptions of the Icelandiccase system distinguish between lexicai and struc-tural case.
Lexical case is assigned in ttle lexi-COIl, whereas tructural case is assigned in syn-tax, under tim provision that it does not overridelexicai case assignment.
This analysis is prob-lematic for grammatical theories such as Cate-gorial Unification Grammar (CUG) and Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) asthe introducion of a syntactic case cmnponentis incompatible with the lexicalist ideology un-derlying these frameworks.
Furthermore, thedefault character of syntactic case introducesa procedural aspect into the grammar whichgoes against he derlarative spirit of unification-based frameworks in general.
In this paper, Ipropose an alternative anMysis, formulated interms of CUC,, in which all case constraints areexpressed lexically and in which default reason-ing is restricted to nonmonotonic nheritance oflexicai information only.1 In t roduct ion :  Case  Mark ingand  Defau l t sThe Icelandic case marking system I has oftenbeen taken as evidence for a distinction betweenstructural (or regular or default) and lexicai(irregular, quirky) case marking.
This distinc-tion is introduced to explain the following twofacts.
First, most verbs select nominative casemarked subjects (1), but a number of verbs se-lect accusative, genitive or dative subjects (2)-(4).
Similarly, most transitive or ditransitiveverbs select an accusative direct object (1), butsome select a nominative, dative, or genitive (4)-(6) object.

In transformational terms, the case of reg-ular case marked NPs corresponds with theirsurface position ((7), (9), and (11)), whereasthe case of irregular case marked NPs corre-sponds to their underlying position ((8), (10),and (12)).
(In these examples, tc representsa lexicaily case marked NP-trace and t a tracewhich has not been assigned case (assunfing thatstructural case is only assigned to surface NPpositions)).

Although,normally, a verb which selects an accusative ob-ject Mways selects a nominative subject whenpassivized, this is not so in (13), where a rais-ing to object verb has been passived.
The lexicaicase assigned by the embedded verb vanta is pre-served even if raising to object and subsequentpassivization takes place.

Lexical case is assigned in the lexicon (thatis, before the lexical and syntactic l)rocessesresponsible for passive formatiml and rais-ing have appfied) attd structural case is as-signed in syntax (after idl other syntacticprocessing has been completed).?
Structural case assignment is a default pro-cess which can never override lexical caseassignments.2Except Sag et at.
(to appear), whose analysis is inmany respects imilar to the one developed below.Andrews' (1982, p. 485) LFG-based account, forinstance, assumes two default conventions, ap-plical)le to functional structures (that is, aftersyntactic processing has been cmnI)leted).
First,if the subject is unmarked for case, (direct andindirect) objects are accusative by default (i.e.only if they are not lexically ease marked), and,second, an argmnent must be nominative if noother ease constraint has been imposed upon it.The application of the first convention mst pre-cede that of the second.
Zaenen et al (1985, p.466) adopt a default case marking conventionwhich appears to be restricted to the lexiconand which assigns nominative case to the highestavailable grammaticM function (i.e.
a grammat-ical function which is present in the argument(or thematic) structure of a verb attd which hasnot been assigned lexical case), and accusativeto the next highest available grammatical fnnctiou.
Zaenen et al concentrate primarily onpassives and do not present an explicit accountt)f raising constructions.

Theiraccount of raising to object assumes that caseassociation is a cyclic rule and that syntactic(as opposed to lexieal) case assignments maybe overwritten by syntactic ase assignments inhigher cycles.These proposals are prol)lematic for standardunification-based formMisms of the PATR-II va-riety (Shieber, 1986a).
The default constraintsfor nominative and accusative case ntarking mustnot apply if :t lexical case constraint is presentalready.
This ilnlflies that tit(., default constraintscannot be added to the syntactic rules or lex-ical entries which introduce subjects and ob-jects, as this would make the constraints ab-solute.
Rather, syntactic default case mark-ing principles would have to be added as a fil-ter on syntactic structures or as seperate de-fault rules (much like the syntactic fi.~ature spec-ification defaults of GPSG) whose applicationmust be intertwined with syntactic processing a.Admitting such extensions, however, is poten-tially damaging to the descriptive adequacy of3Note that the defaults cannot be 'compiled away'in this case, as is proposed for the feature specificationdefaults of GPS( / in Shieber (1986b).Acrv.s DE COLING-92, NA~rrEs, 23-28 Aotrr 1992 9 5 PROC.

These considerations have even been used (in ,lacobson,1990) as arguments against lexicalist accountsof case marking in generM.Below, I will demonstrate hat the Icelandicdata can ire a.ecounted for declaratively alid ina lexicalist fashion.
Ill the next section, I in:troduce a fragment of (;Ill\] including raisingverbs and passives.
Next, the distinction be-tweet| lexicM and structural case is accounted forby assuming that case is encoded as a feature-colnplex and by introducing a system for non-monotonic iiflmritanee of lexical information.
Insection 4 I show that this deeomlrosed case sys-tem makes it possible to analyze the case pat-terns found in passive and raising constructionsas a reflection of a partial agreement relation.The final section romllares the present proposalwith recenl, work by Sag cta l .

In particular, the treatment of rais-ing verbs and passives will be adressed.The categories of categoriM grammar canbe encoded as feature-structures using tire fea-ture CAT(EGORY) to represent basic categoriesand the Datures VaL(UE), ARG(UMENT) andDIR(E(:TIONALITY) to represent complex care-AcrEs DE COLlNG-92, NAbrI'ES, 23-28 Ao\[rr 1992gories.

I willignore tits aspect of the analysis below (but seePollard &, Sag (to appear) for an aimlysis whichmakes a similar assumption).Passive auxiliaries subcategorize for a pas-sive TVP (i.e.
a category VP/NP with pas-sive morphology) and a subject NP (that is,I adopt a lexicalized version of the analysis inBach (1980)).
The fact that the subject is in-terpreted as the object of the '\['VP cat) again beimplemented by making these two argument po-sitions reentrant.
Since raising to object verbsare functors which are reducible to TVI', thisanalysis predicts that such verbs may be pas-sivized:a feature complex.
'l?bat is, instead of usinga single fi~atnre CASE, i will use three distinctfeatures.
The feature STItU(:T distinguishes be-tween structural and lexical case, and the fea-tures Lt;X and NOM distinguish between the var-ious lexical cases and between ominative andaccusative structurM case, respectively.
Thedata in section 1 show that genitive and dativecase are always lexical (i.e.
non-structural), thataccusative may be lexical (if assigned to sub-jects) as well as structural (if assigned to oll-jects), and that nominative is always structurM.Therefore, I assume that the templates NOM,Acc, I)AT, and (JEN assign the values specifiedin table 2 to tim features lnentioned M)ove.

non-structural) accusative case to its subject.The definitions above capture the intuitivedifference between structural and lexical case.If a verb assigns structural, default case, onlyits category needs to be specified, the relevantcase constraints follow by inheritance.
If a verbassigns lexical case, however, case must be speci-fied explicitly.
Although tids analysis introducesa limited form of nonmonotonicity, his does notendanger the declarative nature of the grammar.The definitions in (21) still denote feature struc-tures~ and thus, the effect of combining defaultand non-default information can be computed atcompile time.
That is, there are no formal difl'er-ences between a grammar using nonmonotonicinheritance and agrammar which does not.
Fur-thermore, in Bouma (to appear) it is demomstrated that the inheritance operation itself canbe defined declaratively.
What is gained by us-ing nonmonotouic nheritance is the fact that itsupports a direct and natural implementation fcertain linguistic observations.4 Case  Preservat ionIn this section I argue that the case preserva-tion pheuomena which can be observed in rais-ing and passive constructions are a reflection ofa (partial) case agreement relation between twoNP-argument positions.Ac'r~ DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 aotrr 1992 98~br raising to subject verbs, for instance, thecase of controlling subject is Mways identical tothe subject case constraint specified by the em-bedded VP (that is, I assume that infinitivalverbs may specify structural, nominative, casefor their subject).
Thus, raising to subject verbscan be defined as in (23).
The paths (val arg)and (arg arg) refer to the controlling and con-trolled NP, respectively.

The other casefeatures again agree:(24) R-to-O :( ( IV /NP) /VP(val auI nora) = -(val arg struct) = ( an2 arg struct)(val a~ lex) : ( ar 9 arg lex) ).Note that if the VP-complement assigns nomi-native case to its subject argmnent, the objectis specified as \[STItUCT +, NOM -\], This impfiesthat the object must be accusative, as only thecase template Ace will unify with this specifica-tion.
In all other cases, the lexical case assignedby the Vl'-complement will be preserved.
Inparticular, a lexical accusative subject gives riseto the following derivation:(25) tall6 vanta peninga,\[val IV \]|dir right |/ \[cat np \ ] /\ [ \ ] /a  r /struct - / /taiiS, vanta peninga,dir ht \[\] \]struct np\]1PRoc.

Ifthe object was marked for one of the lexicalcases GEN or I)AT, this case will also appearon the subject.
A structural accusative objectgives rise to a \[NOM -~-, LEX ACC\] speciticationfor the subject, which is unitiable with the casetemplate NOM only.
A lexieai accusative object(as in (25)), on tit(.'
other hand, gives rise to a\[NOM -,LEX ACC\] sul)ject, a specilicati(m whichis only unifiable witil Acc.
Note that this ac-counts for example (13), which showed that lex-ical accusative case imlst be preserved in passiveconstructions.5 Concluding RemarksIn the previous ections I have argued that, con-trary to what has been assumed in previouswork, the Icehmdic case system does not pro-vide compelling evidence for the introduction ofa nonlnonotonic syntactic ase conlpollent.The same conclusion is reached by Sag et aL(to appear), who present an analysis formulatedin terms of IIPSG (Pollard & Sag, 1987, toappear) which emphasizes the theoretical andmethodologic~d a vantages of a declarative, lex~icallst, solution.
Their analysis rests on the as-sulnption that case is encoded using the two fea-tltl'e8 CASI.
; atld I)CASI';~ where the latter i8 usedt() encode the default c~L~(: of certain argumenttmsitioas.
The distinction between structuredand lexical case assigning verbs is implementedas follows:Non-quirky verbs require that the DCASEand CASE values of their subjects beidentified (structure-shared).Quirky verbs impose uo snch identity,and select at particular CASE value fortheir subject.\[t is assumed that raising verbs specit~?
thattile controlling and controlled NI' are reentraut.Note that this predicts that the case of a lex-ical (quirky) case assigning verb is always pre-served.
If a raising verb combines with a Vt'-conq)lentent which assigns tructural case to itssubject, the features ChS~; and D('ASE of thecontrolling NI' will also be reentrant.
Since ob-jects are always (lexically) specilied as \[PEASEA(:C\], this implies that a raising to object verbwhich coml)ines with a structural case assign-ing VP nmst take an accusative case markedobject.
Subjects are assumed to be marked as{I)?:ASl.
; NOM\] by the syntax rule which intro-duces subjects.
Thus, raising to subject verbsthat coinbine with a structural case assigningVP can only take a nominative suhject.The fact that the ca.se of subjects is deter-nfined at least in part by syntax is surprising,given the lcxicalist ~pproach advocated by SagAcres DE COLING-92, NAI,rI'I~S, 23-28 Ao~r 1992 9 9 Paoc.
o~, COLING-92, N^NTUS, A~6.23-28,  1992et al.
It is essential for their analysis, however,that subjects of infinitives are not assigned nom-inative default ease in the lexicon, as this wouldmake it impossible for a raising to object verbto combine with its VP-complement 6.
In theaccount above, there was no need to introducesyntactic case marking principles.
One mighteven maintain that this account, apart from be-ing truly lexica\[, also has the advantage that itavoids the procedural flavor of the analysis ofSag et al, which, a3though formulated eclara-tively, makes essential use of the fact that nom-inative default case is imposed during syntac-tic processing, whereas all other case constraintsare imposed beforehand (i.e.
in the lexicon).Sag et al (to appear) do not adress the casemarking patterns of passives.
The most ob-vious way in which their analysis could coverthese facts would be to assume the passive lex-ical rule presented in Pollard & Sag (1987, p.215).
This seems to account for the facts im-mediately, given the additional assumi)tion thatobjects are marked as \[DCASI~ ACC\] after passivehas applied.
Note, however, that this would im-ply a slightly different lexical component thanis standardly assumed in HPSG, and, perhapsnmre disturbing, would introduce xplicit order-ing of lexical rules or rule types.ReferencesAndrews, Avery (1982).
