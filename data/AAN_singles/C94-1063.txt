PARSING A FLEXIBLE WORD ORDER LANGUAGEVladimir Pericliev and Alexander GrigorovInstitute of Mathematics with Computing Centre,bi.8, 1113 Sofia, Bulgaria, E-mail: BANMAT@BGEARN.BITNETABSTRACTA logic formalism is presented whichincreases the expressive power of the ID/LPformat of GPSG by enlarging the inventory ofordering relations and extending the domain oftheir application to non-siblings.
This allows aconcise, modular and declarative statement ofintricate word order regularities.1.
INTRODUCTIONNatural languages exhibit significant wordorder (WO) variation and intricate orderingrules.
Despite the fact that specific languagesshow less varmtion and complexity in such rules(e.g.
those characterized by either fixed, ortotall 3, free, WO), the vast majority of worldlanguages lie somewhere in-between these twoextremes (e.g.
Steele 1981).
Importantly, eventhe proclaimed examples of rigid WO languages(English) exhibit variation, whereas those withproclaimed total scrambling (Warlpiri; cf.
llale198.1) show restrictions (Kashket 1987).Therefore, we need general grammar formalism,capable of processing "flexible" WO (i.e.complex WO regularities, including bothextremes).There seem to be a number of requirementsthat such a formalism should (try to) fulfil (e.g.Pericliev and Grigorov 1992).
Among thesestand out the formalism's:(i) Expressive power, i.e.
capability of(reasonably) handling complex WO phenomena,or "flexible" WO.
(ii) Linguistic felicity, i.e.
capability ofstating concisely and declaratively WO roles in away maximally approximating linguistic parlancein similar situations.
(iii) Modularity, i.e.
the separation ofconstituency rules from the rules pertaining tothe linearization of these constituents (for theremay be many, and diverse, reasons for wantinglinearization (and constituency) rules easilymodifiable, incl.
the transparency of WOstatements, the imprecision of our currentknowledge of ordering rules or the wish to tailora system to a domain with specific WO).
(iv) Reversibility, i.e.
the ability of a systemto be used for both parsing and generation (thereason being that, even if the system is originallyintended for a parser, complex WO rules may beconveniently tested in the generation mode; inthis sense it is not incidental that e.g.
Kay &Kartttmen 1984 have first constructed agenerator, and used it as a tool in testing the(WO) rules of their grammar, and only then haveconverted it into a parser).In this paper, we present a logic-basedformalism which attempts to satisfy the aboverequirements.
A review shows that mostprevious approaches to WO within the logicgrammars paradigm (Dahl & Abramson 1990)have not been satisfactory.
Definite ClauseGrammar, DCG, (Pereira & Warren 1980), withtheir CF-style rules, are not modular (in thesense above), so will have to specify explicitlyeach ordering of constituents in a separate rule,which results in an intolerably great number ofrules in parsing a free WO language (e.g.
for 5constituents, which may freely permute, thenumber of rules is 5!
= 120).
Other approachescenter around the notion of a "gap" (or "skip").In Gapping Grammar (GG), for instance (Dahl& Abramson 1984, esp.
Dahl 1984), where arule with a gap may be viewed as a recta-rule,standing for a set of CF rules, free WO is moreeconomically expressed, however, due theunnaturahmss of expressing permutations bygaps, GGs generally are clumsy for expressingtlexible WO, WO is not declaratively andmodularly expressed, and GGs cannot be usedfor generation (being besides not efficientlyimplementable).
Another powerful formalism,Contextual Discontinuous Gr,'unmar (Saint-l)izier 1988), which overcomes the GGsproblems with generative capacity, is also farfrom being transparent and declarative inexpressing WO (e.g.
rules with fixed WO arctransformed into free order ones by intruducingspecial rules, containing symbols with nolinguistic motivation, etc.).2.
PROBLEMS FOR TIlE ID/LP FORMATIn tile immediate Dominance/LinearPrecedence (ID/LP) format of GPSG (Gazdar &Pullum 1981, Gazdar et al 1985), where tile397information, concerning constituency(=immediate dominance) and linear order, isseparated, WO rules are concisely, declarativelyand modularly expressed over the domain oflocal-trees (i.e.
trees of depth 1).
E.g.
the ID ruleA "-)~D B, C, D, if no linearization restrictions aredeclared, stands for the mother node expandedinto its siblings appearing in any order; declaringthe restriction { D < C } e.g., it stands for theCFG rules { A --> B D C, A --> D B C and A --) DCB}.It is important to note that in GPSG thelinear precedence rules stated for a pair of siblingconstituents should be valid for the whole set ofgrammar ules in which these constituents occur,and not just for some specific rule (this "global"empirical constraint on WO is called theExhaustive Constant Partial Ordering (ECPO)property).However, there are problems with ECPO.They may be illustrated with a simple examplefrom Bulgarian.
Consider a grammar describingsentences with a reflexive verb and a reflexiveparticle (the NP-subject and the adverb beingoptional), responsible for expressions whoseEnglish equivalent is e.g.
"(Ivan) shaved himself(yesterday)".
(1) S->mNP, VP(2) S "->m VP% omitted subject(3) VP ">m V\[refl\], Part\[refl\], Adv(4) VP ->ID V\[refl\], Part\[refl\]% omitted adverbFirst, assume we derive a sentence, applyingrules (2) and (3).
(5a-b) are the only accept,ablelinearizations of the sister constituents in (3).
(5) a.Brasna (V\[refl\])shavedse (Part\[refl\]) vcera(Adv)himself yesterdayb.Vcera (Adv) se (Part\[mill) brasna(V\[refl\])Yesterday himself shaved(meaning: (Someone) shaved himselfyesterday)LP rules however cannot enforce exactly theseorderings because the CFG, corresponding to(Sa-b), viz.
(6) A- )  B CDA--> D C Bis non-ECPO.
Thus, fixing any ordering betweenany two constituents in (3) will, of necessity,block at least one of the correct orderings (5a-b);,alternatively, sanctioning no WO restriction willresult in overgeneration, admitting, besides thegrammatical (Sa-b), 4 ungrammaticalpermutations.
This inability to impose anarbitrary ordering on siblings we will c,-dl theordering-problem of ID/LP grammars.Now assume we derive a sentence, applyingrules (1) and (4).
The ordering of the siblings,reflexive verb and particle, in (4) now dependson the order of nodes NP and VP higher up inthe tree in rule (i): if NP precedes VP in (1),then the reflexive particle must precede the verbin (4), otherwise it should follow it.
(7) a.Ivan (NP) se (Part\[refl\]) brasna (V\[refll)Ivan himself shavedb,Brasna (V\[refl\]) se (Part\[refl\]) Ivan (NP)Shaved himself Ivan(meaning: Ivan shaved himself)Again we are in trouble since LP rules cannotimpose orderings among non-siblings, theirdomain of application being just siblings.
This wecall the domain-problem of ID/LP grammars, itis essential to note that the domain-problem aynot be remedied (even if we are inclined tosacrifice linguistic intuitions) by "flattening" thetree, e.g.
collapsing rules (1) and (4) into(8) S ">ID NP, V\[refl\], Part\[refl\]Escaping the second problem, thrusts us into thefirst: we now cannot properly order the siblings,the CFG, corresponding to (7a-b), being thenon-ECPO (6).Sporadic counter-evidence for ECPOgrammars has been found for some languageslike English (the verb-particle construction, Sag1987, Pollard and Sag 1987), German (complexfronting, Uszkoreit 1985, Engelkamp et aL1992) and Finnish (the adverb my(is 'also, too'Zwicky and Nevis 1986).
Bulgarian offersm,'kssive counter-evidence (Pericliev 1992b); onemajor example, the Bulgarian clitic system, wediscuss in Section 4.3.
THE FORMALISMEFOG (Extended Flexible word OrderGrammar) extends the expressive power of theID/LP format.
First, EFOG introduces furtherWO restrictions in addition to precedence(enabling it to avoid the ordering-problem), and,second, the formalism extends the domain ofapplication of these WO restrictions (in order tohandle the domain-problem).392In the immediate dominance part of rulesEFOG has two  types of constituents: non-contiguous (notated: #Node) and contiguous(notated just: Node), where Node is somenode.
Informally, a contiguous node shows thatits daughters fern1 a contiguous sequence,whereas a non-contiguous one allows itsdaughters to be interspersed among the sisters ofthis non-contiguous node.E.g.
in EFOG notation (using a double arrowfor ID rules, small case letters for constants andupper case ones for variables), the grammar oftim Latin sentence: Puella bona puerum parvumamat (good girl loves small boy), grammatical inall its 120 permutations and, besides, havingdiscontinuity in the noun phrases, we capturewith the following structured EFOG rules withno we restrictions:s ==> #np(nom) ,  #vp.np(Case)  =:> ad j (Case) ,noun(Case) .vp  :=> verb i  #np(acc)  .accompanied by the dictionary rules:verb  ==> \ [amat \ ] .ad j (nom)  : :>  \ [bona\ ] .ad j (acc )  :=> \ [parvum\] .noun(nom)  ==> \ [pue l la \ ] .noun(ace)  :=> \ [puerum\] .The non-contiguous nodes allow us to impose anordering (or to intersperse, as in the above case)MI their daughter nodes without having tosacrifice the natural constituencies.
It will beclear that this extension of the domain of LPrules (which can go any depth we like), besidesordering between on-siblings, allows an eleganttreatment ofdiscontinuities.In order to solve the ordering-problem, weImve introduced additional we  constraints.
Thefollowing atomic we constraints have beendefined:Precedence constraints:?
precedes (e.g.
a < b)?
immediately precedes ( a << b) (we alsomaintain the notation, > and >>, for(immediately) follows; see commenta W below)Adjacency constraints:?
is adjacent (a <> b)Position conxtraints:?
is positioned first/last (e. g. f i r s t (a ,Node),  where Node is a node; e.g.
f i r s t  (a,s ) designates that a is sentence-initial.We also allow atomic we constraints tocombine into complex logical expressions, usingthe following operators with obvious semantics:?
Conjunction (notated: and.)?
Disjunction (or)?
Negation (not)?
Implication ( i f ,  e.g.
(b >> a) i f  (a<c))?
Equivalence ( i f f ,  e.g.
(b >> a) i f f(a < c) )?
Ifthenelse ( i  f thene  1 s e)Our we  restriction language is, of course,partly logically redundant (e.g.
immediatelyprecedence may be expressed throughprecedence and adjacency, and so is tim casewith the last two of the operators, etc.
).ltowever, what is logically is not necessarilypsychologically equiwdent, and our goal tinsbeen to maintain a linguist-friendly notation (el.requirement (ii) of Section 1).
To take just oneexample, we have 'after' in addition to 'before',since linguists normally speak of precedence ofdependent with respect o head word, not viceversa, and hence will use both expressions inrespective situations (surely it is not by chancethat NLs also have both words).As a simple example of the orderingpossibilities of EFOG, consider the weUniversal 20 (of Greenberg and Hawkins) to theeffect that NPs comprising dem(onstrative),num(eral), adj(ective) and noun can appear inthat order, or in its mirror-image.
We can write a"universal" rule enforcing adjacent permutationsof all constituents a follows:np ==> dem, num,adj ,  noun .ip: dem <> num andnum <> adj  andadj  <> noun.4.
BULGARIAN CLITICSBulgarian clitics fall into different categories:(1) nominals (short accusative pronouns: me"me", te "you", etc.
; short dative prononns: mi"to me", ti "to you", etc.
); (2) verbs (the presenttense forms of "to be" sam "am", si "(you) are",etc.
); (3) adjectives (short possessive pronouns:mi "my", ti "your", etc.
; short ml\]exive pronoun:si "one's own"); and (4) particles (inten;ogative li"do", reflexive se "myself/yourself..", thenegative ne "no(t)", etc.).
They have thedistribution of the specific categories they belongto, but show diverse, and quite complexorderings, varying in accordance with thepositions of their siblings/non-siblings as well asthe position of other clitics appearing in thesentence.'
In effect, dmir ordering as a rulei This often results in discontinuities (o1" non-projectivities).
For an automated way ofdiscovering and a description of such constructs393cannot be correctly stated in the standard ID/LPformat.By way of illustration, below we present heEFOG version (simplified for expositoryreasons) of the grammar (1-4) from Section 2 toget the flavour of how we handle the problemsmentioned there.
The ID rules are as follows(note that the non-contiguous node #vp allowsits daughters v(refl), part (refl), ,'rodadv to be ordered with respect o np):(1') s ==> np,  #v-p.(2') s ==> vp .% omitted subject(3') v-p ==> v(refl),adv.
(4') vp ==> v(refl),% omitted adverbpart(refl),part(refl) .np ::> \[ivan\].v(refl) =:> \[brasna\].part(refl) ::> \[se\].adv ::> \[vcera\].The WO ofv(refl) and part (refl) isas follows.
First, the reflexive particle neveroccurs sentence-initially (information we cannotexpress in ID/LP); in EFOG we express this as:ip: not(f i rst(part(ref l ) ,s))  .Secondly, we use the default rule 'ifthenelse' todeclare the regularity that the particle in questionimmediately precedes the verb, unless when theverb occurs sentenceqnitially, in which case theparticle immediately follows it (which is ofcourse also inexpressible in ID/LP):ip : i fthenelse(f irst(v(refl) ,s),v(refl) << part(refl),part(refl) << v(refl)).These two straightforward LP rules thus are,all we need to get exactly the linearizations wewant: those of (Sa-b) and (7a-b), as well as ,alland the only other correct expressions derivablefrom the ID grammar.
These LP rules are alsointeresting in that they express the overallbehaviour of a number of other procliticallybehaving clitics (as e.g.
those with nominal ,'rodverbal nature; see above).Because of space limitations we cannot enterinto further details here.
Suffice it to say thatEFOG was tested successfully in the descriptionof this veo' complicated omain 2 as well as insome other hard ordering problems in Bulgari,'m.6.
CONCLUSIONLogic grammars have generally failed tohandle flexible WO in a satisfactory way.
Wehave described a formalism which allows thegrammar-writer to express complex WO rules ina language (including discontinuity) in a concise,modular and natural way.
EFOG extends theexpressive power of the ID/LP format in bothallowing complex LP rules and extending theirdomain of application.EFOG is based on a previous version of theformalism, called FOG (Pericliev and Grigorov1992), also seeking to overcome the difficultieswith the ID/LP format.
FOG however looked fordifferent solutions to the problems (e.g.
using LPrules attached to each specific ID rule, ratherthan global ones, which unnecessarilyproliferated the LP part of the grammar; oremploying flattening rather than having non-contiguous grammar symbols to the same effect).EFOG is also related to FO-TAG (Becker et al1991) and the HPSG approach (Engelkamp etal.
1992, Oliva 1992) in extending the domain ofapplicability of LP rules.
A comparisson withthese form~disms is beyond the scope of thisstudy; we may only mention here that ourinventory of LP relations is larger, and unlikee.g.
the latter approach we do not confine tobinary branching trees.REFERENCESBecker T., A. Joshi and O. Rambow (1991).Long-distance scr,'unbling and TAG.
