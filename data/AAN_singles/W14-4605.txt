Louis, Missouri, USAkscanne@gmail.comAbstractIrish and Scottish Gaelic are closely-related languages that together with Manx Gaelic make upthe Goidelic branch of the Celtic family.
We present a statistical model for translation fromScottish Gaelic to Irish that we hope will facilitate communication between the two languagecommunities, especially in social media.
An important aspect of this work is to overcome theorthographical differences between the languages, many of which were introduced in a majorspelling reform of Irish in the 1940?s and 1950?s.
Prior to that date, the orthographies of thetwo languages were quite similar, thanks in part to a shared literary tradition.
As a consequenceof this, machine translation from Scottish Gaelic to Irish has a great deal in common with theproblem of normalizing pre-standard Irish texts, a problem with applications to lexicography andinformation retrieval.
We show how a single statistical model can be used effectively in bothcontexts.1 IntroductionIrish and Scottish Gaelic are closely-related languages in the Celtic language family.
Each is spokenas the day-to-day language by minority communities in Ireland and Scotland, respectively.
While eachlanguage can be considered ?under-resourced?
in terms of language technology when compared withEnglish, French, Spanish, etc., they are significantly better-off than many European minority languages,and far ahead of most indigenous languages of Australia, Africa, and the Americas (Judge et al., 2012),(Bauer, 2014).Our primary aim in this paper is to describe a machine translation (MT) engine for translating fromScottish Gaelic into Irish.
This is not the first time this language pair has been considered in the literature.We developed a rule-based system for translating between these two languages almost ten years ago, butin the opposite direction (Scannell, 2006).
Some of that work has since been ported to the ApertiumMT framework (Corb?
?-Bellot et al., 2005), (Forcada et al., 2011), and in particular is now available asfree software; because of this we were able to reuse those resources in the present project.
We believestrongly in open source approaches to language technology development for minority languages, and sothe source code and lexicons for the present project are all freely available under the GPL.1Our secondary aim is to apply the same statistical model to an equally important language-processingchallenge, namely the standardization of historical Irish texts.
The Irish language underwent a majorspelling reform in the 1940?s and 1950?s with the introduction of the the so-called Caighde?an Oifigi?uil(Official Standard) by the Irish government.
The Official Standard succeeded in simplifying the orthogra-phy in a number of ways, and has been almost universally adopted in textbooks, government publications,and by the news media.
On the other hand, from the perspective of a language technologist, it has causedgreat difficulties.
For example, pre-standard texts are rendered invisible to search engines when userssearch via standard spellings.
And a tremendous amount of high-quality writing by native Irish speakers1See https://github.com/kscanne/caighdean.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

The answer is twofold: first, we can cast the standardization problem as an MT problembetween two very closely-related languages (namely, pre-standard and standard Irish), and second, theorthography of pre-standard Irish has a great deal in common with the orthography of Scottish Gaelic,and so it turns out that a single statistical model works well to solve both problems.
A brief descriptionof the standardizer has appeared previously in (U??
Dhonnchadha et al., 2014), as part of a more complexpipeline for processing historical Irish texts for lexicography.Many authors have considered MT between closely-related language pairs, including dozens of papersdescribing rule-based systems based on the Apertium engine (Forcada et al., 2011).2Several otherpapers have taken statistical or hybrid approaches, e.g.
(Haji?c, 2000) for Czech and Slovak, (Altintasand Cicekli, 2002) for Turkish and Crimean Tatar, (Nakov and Tiedemann, 2012) for Macedonian andBulgarian, and (Miller, 2008) and the references therein.
Statistical MT techniques have also been usedpreviously for historical text normalization; see for example (Pettersson et al., 2013).The outline of the paper is as follows: In section 2, we describe the shared statistical model in generalterms, and discuss the problematic notion of ?standard Irish?.
In section 3 we describe gd2ga, ourScottish Gaelic?Irish MT system, along with the parallel corpus used in its development.
Finally, insection 4, we introduce and evaluate the Irish standardizer.2 The ModelIn this section we describe the statistical model that underlies both the gd2ga machine translation systemand the Irish standardizer.
We view both problems as instances of machine translation between veryclosely-related languages, the latter requiring translation from what we will call ?pre-standard Irish?
to?standard Irish?
(with scare quotes because both terms are problematic; more on this below).
Because ofthe limited syntactic differences between source and target in each case, it suffices to use a simple word-based model without reordering, a variant of the well-known IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1993).
It isimportant to distinguish the statistical model per se (which assigns probabilities to translation candidates)from the means by which those probabilities are acquired.
In the context of the IBM models, ExpectationMaximization (EM) is typically used for the latter; here we take a simpler approach, described in section2.2.
In the two subsections that follow, we will describe the language model and translation model,respectively.2.1 Language ModelThe target language in both cases is what we are calling ?standard Irish?, and so a single language modelsuffices for both systems.
We use a trigram model which is typical in this context and normally wouldrequire little further comment.
In our situation, however, we run into a couple of major difficulties.First, there is not complete agreement with respect to what ?standard Irish?
means.
The first movementtoward standardization of the written language goes back to the 1930?s with the establishment of govern-ment committees to look at the question.
A simplified spelling system was published in 1945 (Rann?ogan Aistri?uch?ain, 1945) and implemented by the government translation office around the same time.
Asimplified grammar was published in 1958 (Rann?og an Aistri?uch?ain, 1958), followed by two importantbilingual dictionaries (de Bhaldraithe, 1959;?O D?onaill, 1977) that helped encourage use of the standardlanguage by the general public.
The problem is that these dictionaries do not completely conform to thepublished standard, nor do many grammar books that are used in schools and by independent learnerseven today.
To compond the confusion, a revised version of the official standard was recently published(U?
?bh Eachach, 2012), and has been criticized by some in the language community (Mac Lochlainn,2012), so it remains to be seen the extent to which it will be embraced as the new ?standard Irish?.The second difficulty is that, even to the extent that everyone agrees on certain elements of the standard,no one implements them completely in their writing, which is to say that virtually all non-trivial texts in2For the most up-to-date references, see http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Publications.34Irish contain some non-standard forms.
In the case of gd2ga, this is not of great concern; we could trainthe target language model with the texts we have, and the output would resemble the fluent, natural Irishof the training texts.
For the standardizer, however, we are aiming at very high precision, with the outputconforming to some version of the standard.
In short, the problem is this: we want to train an n-grammodel for a certain language, but there are no non-trivial texts written in that language.We get around these issues by making use of a suite of open-source Irish language proofing toolscalled An Gramad?oir.3From an initial corpus of about 100 million words, we selected a subset of about40 million words comprised of the texts that are most conformant to the standard.
To do this, the rulesimplemented in An Gramad?oir were first separated into those representing true ?errors?
(misspellings,grammatical mistakes, etc.)
from those representing standardizations.
Then, An Gramad?oir was run onevery text in the corpus in order to assign each a numerical measure of ?non-standardness?
(the numberof standardizations flagged per 100 words).
The subcorpus was chosen from the texts with the lowestnon-standardness scores.
Finally, we applied a small number of automated substitutions to certain non-standard forms that are nearly as common as their standardizations in real-world texts, e.g.
nach dt?ainigvs.
n?ar th?ainig (?did not come?
).Once the training corpus is generated in this way, we tokenize and compute the probabilities forthe trigram language model (no pruning), and smooth using absolute discounting (Chen and Goodman,1996).
The implementation of the language model is included as part of the translator itself in order toavoid external dependencies on libraries such as IRSTLM, KenLM, etc.2.2 Translation ModelThe translation model represents the conditional probability of some source language word correspond-ing to a given target language word.
Since the parallel corpora for our two translation problems arerelatively small, and since our goal is very high-precision translation, a statistical word alignment ap-proach using Expectation Maximization does not give suitable results.
Instead, we take advantage ofthe resources that we have at hand; specifically, high-quality bilingual lexicons together with a well-understood set of spelling rules for mapping source language words to cognates in the target language.In the context of Scottish Gaelic to Irish MT, the latter include mappings like -chd ?
-cht and -eu-?-?ea- (together these two rules map a word like creuchd (?wound?)
to its Irish cognate cr?eacht for exam-ple).
For Irish standardization, there is a separate set of rules but with significant overlap, e.g.
-idhea-?-?
?o-, which maps buidheach (?thankful?)
to bu?
?och and fuidheall (?remainder?)
to fu??oll.
These last twoexamples are valid for both gd2ga and for the standardizer.A source-to-target language mapping is often discovered through a combination of rule-based spellingchanges like the ones above, plus a lexical mapping when the rules do not suffice.
We define the transla-tion model in the following simple way: (1) all source language words that are paired with a given targetlanguage word are assumed to have the same conditional probability; and (2) when a source languageword is paired with a target language word by applying some number n of spelling rules, we multiplythe conditional probability by a fixed ?penalty?
?n.
When more than one sequence of rules leads to thesame target word, we take the shortest sequence.
The constant ?
was optimized through a tuning processusing held-out data from the parallel corpora; we used the value of ?
which gave the smallest word-errorrate on the held-out test set.Choices (1) and (2) above were made for the sake of simplicity.
In future work, we plan to experimentwith allowing different probabilities for different rules, as well as using EM to train the translationprobabilities, restricting to the lexicographical translation pairs.The decoding process is quite simple.
The algorithm processes the source sentence word-for-wordfrom left-to-right, and keeps track of all possible target language hypotheses along with their probabili-ties, as computed using the translation model and language model.
When multiple hypotheses share thesame final two words, we are able to discard all but the one with the highest probability.
When we reachthe end of the sentence, the highest probability candidate is output as the translation.3See http://borel.slu.edu/gramadoir/353 Scottish Gaelic to Irish MTScottish Gaelic and Irish are are sufficiently distinct as spoken languages that even fluent speakers with-out experience in the other language are usually only able to understand bits and pieces.
As a result, thereare very few spoken-language contexts in which Scottish Gaelic and Irish speakers are able to interactwith each other in either language, and often have to resort to English.4The written language is significantly easier, even in light of the Irish spelling reform and more recentreforms on the Scottish Gaelic side (Scottish Qualifications Authority, 2009) which have made thingsmore difficult than they might conceivably be.
Indeed, there are vibrant online communities of Irishand Scottish Gaelic speakers availing themselves of social media, especially Facebook and Twitter, andthere is evidence of a significant amount of bilingual communication going on between the two languagecommunities.
(Scannell, 2013)We believe there could be even more, given the right tools.
By implementing high-quality ScottishGaelic to Irish machine translation, and by deploying it in combination with our earlier ga2gd system,we hope to encourage greater communication between the two communities.3.1 Parallel CorpusA parallel corpus plays a key role in the development of the bilingual lexicon and spelling rules, aswell as being used for evaluation purposes.
Unfortunately, direct translations between the two languagesare extremely rare (despite the relative ease with which such translations could be made), and eventranslations of a common English source text proved hard to come by.
So we chose to include quite a bitof material that might otherwise have been left out of a parallel corpus: software translations (Firefox,LibreOffice, etc.
), poetry, song lyrics, prayers, bilingual word lists, Irish glosses on Scottish Gaelic sourcematerial (and vice versa), bilingual tweets, titles of linked Wikipedia pages, and so on.
When combinedwith more traditional material (Bible texts, fiction and non-fiction prose translations), we were able toassemble roughly a million words of parallel text: 129,983 translation segments containing 1,016,041words of Scottish Gaelic and 956,598 words of Irish.
This is, to our knowledge, the only non-trivialparallel corpus for this language pair.53.2 Bilingual LexicographyThe heart of the system is the bilingual lexicon which is being painstakingly constructed by hand (workin progress), drawing upon a number of freely available resources for both languages.
Even though thetranslation system does no part-of-speech tagging, the lexicon stores lemmas in Scottish Gaelic taggedby part-of-speech, mapped to lemmas in Irish, also tagged by part-of-speech.
Then, mappings betweensurface forms are produced by employing morphological generators on both sides (cf.
(Tyers, 2009)).This produces mappings for over 150,000 surface forms from a bilingual lexicon with about 13,000lemmas.We have used the following resources while building the lexicon.?
The parallel corpus described in section 3.1?
Scottish Gaelic?English dictionaries created by Michael Bauer (Bauer, 2014)?
Various Scottish Gaelic?English dictionaries hosted by Sabhal M`or Ostaig6?
The bilingual lexicon created for (Scannell, 2006)4This despite the efforts of organizations like Colmcille (formerly Iomairt Cholm Cille), established to encourage preciselythis sort of interaction.5We have made the portions of the corpus that are under open licenses available here http://borel.slu.edu/pub/ccgg.zip.6See http://www2.smo.uhi.ac.uk/gaidhlig/faclair/.363.3 EvaluationWe began by evaluating the coverage of the source language lexicon.
For this, we gathered a monolin-gual Scottish Gaelic corpus comprised of 3.9M tokens from 14713 web-crawled texts (Scannell, 2007).The system recognized 96.74% of the tokens in this corpus, a result which is comparable to, or evenbetter than, the coverage of many open-source spell checkers on (noisy) web texts.
This result is dueto (1) the fact that we were able to re-purpose a number of open-source lexical resources when buildingour dictionary, (2) the addition of a large database of ?untranslatables?
: proper names (e.g.
Facebook,Akerbeltz), non-Gaelic words (mostly English, but some Latin, French, etc.
), and abbreviations (e.g.
km,vs) and (3) the ability of the system to handle misspellings and variants either by including them in thelexicon (with mappings to ?standard?
forms) or through the application of spelling rules.Evaluating the MT system itself proved problematic.
Even though we were able to assemble a parallelcorpus, the vast majority of the texts are translations from a common English source (principally, theopen-source software translations and the Bible texts), as opposed to direct translations between Irish andScottish Gaelic.
To get around this issue, the author manually translated a collection of 593 sentencesfrom Scottish Gaelic to Irish and used this as a test corpus.
When comparing the output of gd2gawith these reference translations, the word-error rate (WER) was 38.67%.
This can be compared with abaseline system that simply leaves the Scottish Gaelic source text unchanged, yielding a WER of 88.09%.This is still not completely satisfactory as an evaluation for a couple of reasons.
First, given the natureof the statistical model, the translations produced by gd2ga stay very close to the source language text,and so a sentence likeTha mi a?
tuigsinn a-nis.
(?I understand now.?
)translates toT?a m?e ag tuiscint anois.whereas a human translator might render this more naturally in Irish as ?Tuigim anois.?.
Similar exam-ples in other verb tenses abound.
Secondly, the system sometimes gets initial mutations wrong (tendingto be conservative and preserving the mutations of the source text due to the penalty factor ?
), thoughthis rarely impacts comprehension or fidelity of the translation.
It might be reasonable to compute amodified WER for Celtic languages that ignores differences in mutations, but we did not pursue this.4 Irish StandardizerThe standardizer described in this section takes as input an Irish language text and outputs a version thatconforms as closely as possible to ?standard Irish?, subject to the vagaries discussed above in section2.1.
The principal application of the standardizer has been to the indexing of pre-standard texts to enablesearch and retrieval via standard spellings, mainly for lexicographical purposes (U??
Dhonnchadha et al.,2014).
In this application, the standardized texts are used only for indexing purposes, which is to say thatthe pre-standard texts are displayed to users in search results.An interesting second application would be to apply the standardizer to the huge amount of Irishlanguage literature (novels, plays, many of them in translation) published from the 1920?s through the1940?s in order to make those texts accessible to a modern readership that has grown up on the standardorthography.
Indeed, a number of these books have been republished in recent years, but to my knowl-edge they have all been standardized by hand, e.g.
(Doyle, 2012).
To do this automatically, somewhatmore care would be needed in order to not completely destroy the richness of the Irish dialects found inthese texts (as the standardizer in its current form does, more or less), probably by creating customizedversions of the standardizer for each dialect, together with limited post-editing.4.1 Parallel CorpusTo support development of the ?bilingual?
lexicon (pre-standard/standard word pairs) and spelling rules,and to enable formal evaluation of the system, we created a large parallel corpus of pre-standard/standard37sentence pairs.
The standardizations were taken from republications of older material of the kind de-scribed above, and were performed manually by human editors.
In all, we used eighteen books togetherwith their standardizations, segmented by sentences and aligned into 46,914 translation pairs (almost allone sentence to one sentence).
There are 814,365 words on the pre-standard side and 801,236 words onthe standard side.4.2 LexicographyThe bilingual lexicon is similar in structure to the Scottish Gaelic?Irish lexicon described above in section3.2, with pre-standard lemmas being mapped to standard lemmas, and morphological generators appliedto each side to create mappings of surface forms.
The lexicon again draws upon existing resources;first and foremost, about 22,000 standardization pairs used by An Gramad?oir for spelling and grammarcorrection, along with an additional 10,000 pairs drawn directly from an electronic version of (?O D?onaill,1977).
After applying the morphological generators, we end up with mappings for about 135,000 surfaceforms.
Keep in mind, however, that the spelling rules play a more important role for the standardizer thanthey do for the Scottish Gaelic translator, and so the actual source language coverage on pre-standard Irishtexts is significantly better than the number 135,000 might suggest.4.3 EvaluationWe performed two evaluations of the standardizer.The first evaluation is similar to the one we performed on gd2ga, described above in section 3.3.Namely, we held out a sample of 200 sentence pairs from the parallel corpus, applied the standardizerto the pre-standard sentences, and compared the results with the reference standardizations, yielding aWER of 9.86%.
Of course the translation problem here is much easier, as illustrated by a baseline WERof 27.28% obtained by leaving the pre-standard texts unchanged.System WER Baselinegd2ga 38.67 88.09Standardizer 9.86 27.28Table 1: Summary of results (Word Error Rates)As a second evaluation, we looked at sentence-level accurancy.
The point here is that in most casesthere really is one ?optimal?
standardization of a given input sentence and that should be our aim.
Forexample, the pre-standardAcht go h-?adhmhail bh??
lucht s?
?othch?ana thall agus i bhfos.
(?But, luckily, there were peaceful people on both sides.?
)must, in a just world, map to:Ach go h?adh?uil bh??
lucht s?
?och?ana thall agus abhus.and we would consider any other standardization as incorrect.The second evaluation, therefore, involves holding out a sample of 4147 sentence pairs from the par-allel corpus, applying the standardizer to the pre-standard sentences, and comparing word-for-word withthe standardized sentence (ignoring differences in punctuation).
The current version gets 35.06% of thesesentences completely correct.
This can be compared with a score of 7.45% for a baseline system thatdoes nothing to the input text (that is, 7.45% of the pre-standard sentences require no standardization atall, mostly very short sentences).AcknowledgementsFirst and foremost I would like to thank Michael Bauer for making all of his Scottish Gaelic resourcesfreely available, and for his outstanding work translating open-source software packages into Scottish38Gaelic.
