Proceedings of the 9th SIGdial Workshop on Discourse and Dialogue, page 128,Columbus, June 2008. c?2008 Association for Computational LinguisticsInvited TalkSpeaking More Like You: Lexical,Acoustic/Prosodic, and Discourse Entrainmentin Spoken Dialogue SystemsJulia HirschbergDepartment of Computer ScienceColumbia Universityjulia@cs.columbia.eduAbstractWhen people engage in conversation, they adapt the way they speak tothe speaking style of their conversational partner in a variety of ways.
Forexample, they may adopt a certain way of describing something based uponthe way their conversational partner describes it, or adapt their pitch rangeor speaking rate to a conversational partner?s.
They may even align theirturn-taking style or use of cue phrases to match their partner?s.
These typesof entrainment have been shown to correlate with various measures of tasksuccess and dialogue naturalness.
While there is considerable evidence forlexical entrainment from laboratory experiments, much less is known aboutother types of acoustic-prosodic and discourse-level entrainment and littlework has been done to examine entrainments in multiple modalities for thesame dialogue.
We will discuss work on entrainment in multiple dimensionsin the Columbia Games Corpus.
Our goal is to understand how the differentvarieties of entrainment correlate with one another and to determine whichtypes of entrainment will be both useful and feasible for Spoken DialogueSystems.128
