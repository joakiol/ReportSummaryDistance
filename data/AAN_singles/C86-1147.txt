Translation by Understanding: A Machine Translation Sy,i;tem LUTEHirosato NOMURA, Shozo NAITO, Yasuhiro KATAGIRI, and Aldra SHIMAZUNTT Basic Research Laboratories, Masashino-shi, Tokyo, 180, JapanAbstractThis pal)or presents a linguistic model for languageunderstanding and describes its application to an experimentalmachine translation system called LUTE.
The languageunderstanding model is an interactive model between the memorystructure and a text.
The memory structure is hierarchical andrepresented in a frame-network.
Linguistic and non-linguisticknowledge is stored and the result of understanding the text isassimilated into the memory structure.
Tim understanding process isinteractive in that the text invokes knowledge and the understandingprocedure intcrprots the text by using that knowledge.
A linguisticmodel, called the Extended Case Structure model, is defined byadopting three kinds of information: structure, relation and concept.These three are used rccursively and iteratively as the basis formemory organization.
These principles are applied to the design andimplementation f the LUTE which translates Japanese into Englishand vice versa.1.
IntroduetimlSince the early 1970s, a variety of approaches to languageunderstanding have been proposed.
In particular, the importance ofknowledge organization has been emphasized, and linguisticallystructured knowledge such as Script \[11 and knowledgerepresentation frameworks such as Frame \[2\] and Semantic Network\[31 have been proposed.
At the santo time, the linguistic approach asbeen adopted to reveal the discourse structure, the cognitive approachhas attempted to explain phenomena such as focus, topic andintention, and the formal semantic approach has been used toestablish semantics based on tim logical model theory.We propose an interactive model between the memory structureand the text (or utterance) as a language understanding model.
In themodel, knowledge stored in the memory structure plays the principalrole such that the text invokes knowledge and the understandingsystem interprets the text using that knowledge.
The knowledgeconsists of linguistic knowledge and non-linguistic knowledge.
Theyare closely related each other and incorporated into the memorystructure simultaneously.
As a result of understanding, the systemassimilates tile meaning structure of the text into its memorystructure.
The bases for representing the knowledge are structure,relation and concept which are the fundamental cmnponents forconstructing and representing the memory structure including themeaning structure ra sentence.
For the purpose oI'clear definition oflinguistic information, a linguistic model, called the Extended CaseStructure model (ECS), which is capable of treating the structures ofcomplex sentences, is provided.These principles have been applied to the design of a new versionof the experimental machine translation system called LUTE(Language U nderstander, Translator and Editor) \[4\].
This paperdeals mainly with the current Japanese-English version of LUTE(LUTE-JE versioml) \ [5 \ ] .
LUTE has following processingcharacteristics: 1) Not only syntactic but also semantic relations(dependencies) between modifiers and modificants are analyzedsimultaneously.
2) All kinds of information such as syntacticpatterns, meaning structures, lexical items, and knowledge arerepresented in a uniform framework, called a Frame-Network.
3)Analysis produces a ~most plausible meaning structm'e' based on theprediction of syntactic structures and the integration of semanticstructures.
4) Transfer is realized as a general fl'amework formanipulationg the frame network.2.
Language Understanding Model2.1 Memory OrganizationKnowledge can be organized into various memory structuresdepending on the type of knowledge.
TheMe structures are usuallyhierarchical and consist of three layers; 1) long-term memory, 2)discourse memory, and 3) episodic memory (or short-term emory).Long-term memory stores knowledge such as dictionaries, grammars,experiences, cmnmon-sense knowledge, expert knowledge, andprocedural knowledge such as how to infm" a fact from a collection offacts.
Knowledge also contains recta-level knowledge such asknowledge about he characteristics of knowledge and the nsage of it.Discourse memory stores knowledge concerning the situation as  anenvironment of utterances, and the history of understandings such as"Who is the author?
", "What is the topic?
", and "What is the purposeof the discourse segment?
", Episodic memory steres the meaningstructure of the ongoing segment of the text and its construction is themain issue in the discussion of sentence analysis.The memory model described above can be applied to account for anumber of linguistic phenomena.
For example, the differencebetween two Japanese anaphoric expressions " ono ( 7?
~),, and "ano( ~ ?))"
(both expressions correspond to the determiner "the" in mostEnglish contexts) is explained by using the memory structure modelas follows: a referent of the noun modified by "sono" is found in tilediscourse memory, and a referent of the noun modified by "ano" isfound in the long-term emory.2.2 Basis for Memory OrganizationThe memory is constructed by assembling three kinds of basicelements; 1) structure, 2) relation and 3) concept.
Structure is apacket of memory organization.
A variety of structures can be used torepresent linguistic knowledge, the situation of utterance, and themeaning structure of a sentence.
Concept is associated withstructures which include all kinds of constituent structures; words,phrases, sentences, etc.
Hence, this definition of concept, in a sense, islanguage-dependent.
There are two kinds of concepts, semanticcategories and word meanings.
Thus a word and its meaning arestrictly distinguished.
Relation integrates tructures to form acompomld structure.
Examples of compound structures are compoundnorms, ease structures, and complex sentences.
There are severalkinds of relations uch as casc relations, conjunctive relations andtaxonomic relations between semantic ategories.2.3 Understanding ProcessIn the understanding process, operations uch as matching,searching, deletion, replacement, integration, and generation areexecuted in the memory structures.
For example, in a morphologicalanalysis process, using their literal expressions as search keys, thesearch for words to be identified is made using lexical entries in thedictionary, and in the case analysis process, a search is made for caseinstances that match prototype cases in ease frames.As understanding proceeds, the essence of episodic memory isassimilated into discourse memory and the essence of discoursememory is assimilated into long-term emory.
Discourse memory(long-term emory) is not simply an accumulation of the contents ofepisodic memory (discourse memory), but is a structured memorycoherently organized from the episodic memory (discourse memory).As a prelimlnary model of discourse memory, we define a Local SceneFrame (LSF), which is a collection of cases and predicates in precedingsentences already analysed.
LSF is partly viewed as describing a6271q Contextual structure~nted  case structure ntodel ~ FL .

1 Extended Case Structure Modelsituation in which the utterance is carried out.
Information in theLSF is used for fi l l ing in missing cases, and resolving anaphora.
Adiscussion of the detailed procedure for the assimilation would bebeyond the scope of this paper.3.
Extended Case St ructure  Model3.1 Genera l  F rameworkThe Extended Case Structure Model (ECS) is a l inguistic modelfor representing the meaning structures of the text.
Thus the ECSpresents a representation scheme for the episodic memory.
Figure 1shows its fundamental construction.
The traditional case structure(Fil lmorean type) is a structure for a unit sentence which consistsmainly of relations between ouns and a verb.
This is not sufficient orepresent structures of real sentences which sometimes have complexnoun phrases, compound sentences, etc.
Also, the ECS has to havefacilities for representing other structures involving relationsbetween a noun and a noun, a verb and a verb, etc.
The ECS has beendesigned to integrate those structures into one linguistic model.
Itsnature is hierarchical as to the compoundness of constituents,iterative as to conjunction, and recursive as to embedding.
Usingthese formalisms, the syntactic and semantic structures of sentencescan be represented uniformly and correctly.3.2 Semant ic  St ructure  in ECSThere are two types of semantic structurcs, composite and primi-tive structures.
A cmnposite structure is made by integrating seman-tic structures using semantic relations.
A primitive structure, bydefinition, cannot be divided into further substructures.
In general, asingle word corresponds to a primitive structure, and a phrasecorresponds to a composite structure.
Since syntactic information canalso contribute to define meaning structures, each semantic structuresimultaneously incorporates not only meaning information but alsosyntactic information.We do not assume a language-independent u iversal semanticrepresentation.
Thus, it is necessary to define a proper ECS for eachlanguage: Japanese ECS (J-ECS) \[6\] for Japanese language andEnglish ECS (E-ECS) \[7\] for English language.
In the translationprocess from Japanese into English, the analysis procedure generatesa J-ECS for a Japanese sentence, and the transfer proceduregenerates an E-ECS corresponding to the J-ECS.3.3 Semant ic  Relat ion in ECSSenmntic relation connects semantic structures and builds alarger semantic structure, ranging from a word structure to asentence structure.
Figure 2 shows types of semantic relations, andeach of them can be explained briefly as fellows:1) Noun relation: Relationship between nouns; Examples arewhole-part, upper-lower, possession, material, etc.2) Case relation: Relationship between a case element and apredicate; Examples are object, agent, instrument, place, etc.6223) Embedded relation: Relationship between an embedded sentenceand a noun phrase, which can be categorized into three types; a)case re'lation between a modified noun phrase and the predicate iua modifier embedded sentence, b) noun relation between amodified noun phrase and a noun phrase in a modifier embeddedsentence, and c) an appositive or subsidiary relation between amodified noun phrase and a modifier embedded sentence.4) Conjunctive relation: Relationship between sentences; Examplesare cause-result, ime-advance, assumption, etc.3.4 Concept  in ECSConcepts are associated with structures mentioned above.
Amongthem, concepts associated with word structures represent wordmeanings which appear when the words are used in a sentence.
Aword meaning is represented by principal concepts, supplenmntaryconcepts, and their semantic dependencies.
Principal andsupplementary concepts are dcfined by using semantic ategories, andprepared for nouns, adverbs, verbs, adjective-verbs and modalities asshown in Figure 3.
Semantic dependencies are defined by usingsemantic relation fi'ames and semantic structure frames.
Semanticcategories, semantic relation fi'amcs and semantic structure frameshave the following characteristics: 1) There are two types of concepts:prototype and instance.
Prototypes play a part of selectionalconstraint to define semantic dependency structures.
Instances howan assimilated structure which satisfies the selectienal constraints.2) They shows semantic commonness and analogy between twostructures.
This allows the system to share information and toprovide facilities for paraphrase.
3) Semantic ategories make tip ahierarchical structure.
This provides the system with inheritanceability and information sharing.4.
Dict ionar ies,  Knowledge and Their  Representat ion4.1 Dict ionaryThere are two typos of dictionaries in LUTE.
Mono-liugualdictionaries are used in analysis and generation, while bMingualdictionaries are used in transfer.
Mono-lingual dictionaries have thefollowing information about words and concepts: 1) tIow the word isexpressed, 2) how the word is used in the syntax of a sentence, and 3)what concept the word corresponds to.
Bi-lingual dictionaries hasinformation on the correspondence of concepts in two differentlanguages, and will be explained in section 6.
(Note that concepts aredefined here by associating structures which are generally languagedependent.)
Figure 4 shows the contents of a word dictionary.A word meaning can be regarded as an entry to the conceptualknowledge description.
The LUTE dictionaries contain the followingsemantic information:1) Semantic category (for word meanings): Principal conceptsassociated with the word meaning.
Those for nouns and adverbsare used as selectional constraints in semantic relation analysis.Those for predicate s are used to analyse modality.2) Case fi'ame (for predicate word meanings): Constraints and caserelations which are applied to construct unit sentence semanticstructures.
There are three types of ease frames: intrinsic foreach predicate word nmaning, common for several predicate wordmeanings, optional for outer ease relations.3) Noun relation frame (for noun word meanings): Constraints andsemantic relationships which ace applied to construct semanticstructures made up of two nouns.
Case frames are also used as aldnd of object relation frames for predicate-type nouns.4) Event relation frame (for predicate word meanings): Constraintsand semantic relationships to be applied to construct complexsentence semantic structures.
An example is the relation betweenthe verb in a main clause and the verb in a subordinate clause.5) Heuristics (for semantic ategories and relation fi'ames): This isused for resolving ambiguity of semantic categories, semanticrelations, and semantic structures by linguistic information suchN~oun-ielalot~ .

3 Semantic Categoriesas preference over several semantic relations, semantic relationfillers, and remaining semantic relation fi'ames not yet filled.4.2 KnowledgeBoth comnmn.-sense knowledge and expertdmowledge areconstructed using basic elements such as concepts, 'elations andstructures as well as linguistic structures.
Thus the non-lingulstlcknowledge manipulated in LUTI,; is not represented in a simple data-base fl'amework but rather incorporated into the memory structure.Although re.troy language processing systems use the term"knowledge" rather vaguely, LU\[\['Itl gives a concrete form toknowledge in the sense of franmmetworks corresponding to wordmeanings.
The current version of I,UTE defines the following types ofknowledge in terms of semantic relations:1) Concept Relation: Relations such as hyponymy, synonymy,antonymy, whole-part, and possession.
One example is "whole-part" rehttion between "densha ( ;~ ii'-') (train)" and "made (~)(window)".
(A window can be a part era train.
)2) Event State Relation: Relations between two events or betweenan event and a state.
One example is "subsidiary situation" rela-tion that "nioi (~  ~ ) (smell)" results from "yaku ('l')'~ < ) (grill)".3) Mete knowledge: This is used for reasoning, such as in traversingthe concept networks, and checMng semantic consistencyaccording to concept networks.4.3 F rame-NetworkAll information manipulated in LUTE is represented in a uniformframeworlt, called a Frame-Network.

4 Contents of dictionary (nlono-lingual)and event relation fi'ame is represented by frames with correspondlngframe names.
These fi'amcs consist of subframes representingsemantic relation information.
Slots of a frame which representssemantic relation infermation contain information such as semanticcategory and cast particles stipulating the semantic relation.
Anidiomatic expression between a noun and a verb is represented by aco-relation fi'ame.
This is the convention for sharing case slots in caseDames to yield an effective processing for case analysis and selectionof word meaning.
These frames are also provided for each noun.I Icuristies are defined as methods (daemons) in fl'ames.
The conceptrelation of knowledge can be represented by inheritance and semanticrelation slots of noun relation fl'ames.
Event state relation isrepresented by event-object relation fl'ames, and expressed in a wordmeaning of the eorresponding noun.
Using this relation fFame,semantic relations in a phrase, "Sakana we yaku nioi (,(rE {" ;t}'~ { ~ ~,)(Smell of fish grill ing)" can be analysed.
Me,a-knowledge is repre-sented as a procedure for unifying frames to select a word meaning,inheritance mechanism, and methods in frames as well as heuristics.5.
Extended Case Analys isl,',xtended Case Analysis (F, CA) builds the meaning structure of asentence which is expressed by tim fi'amework based on ECS.
TheECA integrates both syntactic and semantic analysis using StructurePatterns.
Analysis proceeds in ,~t manner ill which, top down structureprediction and bottom-up structure integration are intertwined.Viewing the analysis from the standpoint of the activation oflcnowledge, an expression activates a word, a word activates a wordmeaning, a word meaning activates concepts, and coneel)ts activateconcept relations.
We will describe the prccedure for analyzingJapanese sentences in the following sections.5.l F low and Control  in ECAIt is assumed here that the morphological analysis process hasalready segmented a sentence into a sequence of words.
The ECAprocedure can be explained roughly as follows.
First, the ECApredicts a sentence structure in a top-down manner using StructurePatterns.
Second, it analyzes semantic structures for the predictedsentence structure using Semantic Structure Frames, which describeconstraints for integrating the substructures.
Finally, thosesubstructures are integrated into a bigger structure.
Theseprocedures are performed recursively for each level of constituentconstruction until an integrated meaning structure is obtained for theentire sentence.
When information concerning semantic structureframes or knowledge is missing, the ECA does not attempt o nmke aunique integrated meaning structure.
Rather it utilizes a variety ofheuristics, thus making it possible to order multiple possible meaningstructures in terms of likelihood or plausibil ity based on a score givento each meaning strueture.
A rough outline of this analysis ispresented in Figure 5.623syntact ic  pred ic t ion  mean ing  integrat ion\[ unit structure \]~ .

g Rough sketch of analysis flowtI istorieal information, including both the success and failure ofthe processing, is stored so that the ECA can avoid analyzing thesame sequence of substructures in the backtracking process.5.2 St ructure  Pat ternA structure pattern is a package of knowledge for predletingsyntactic constructions between pairs of modifiers and modifieantsamong the constituent structures of a sentence.
Based on thisprediction, an analysis procedure is invoked to analyze theirsemantic structures.
If this analysis succeeds, themodifier/modificant pair is integrated into a new unified structure.Structure patterns are assigned to each structure type in the ECS.
Anexample of structure patterns for a unit sentence is shown in Figure 6.A structure pattern eenslsts of three parts: 1) the condition forapplying the pattern, 2) the procedure for semantic structureanalysis, and 3) newly integrated structure type.
The first partdescribes whether this structure pattern can be applied to thestructure sequence.
The second part performs a semantic relationanalysis of the structure sequence which satisfy the above condition.The third part describes the structure type to be produced by theabove procedure.
A structure pattern might be viewed as a contextfi'ee gramnmr (CFG) rule augmented with a semantic relationanalysis.
In this case, the condition part corresponds to the right handside of the CFG rule, the integrated structure type part corresponds tothe left hand side of it, and the procedure part can be seen as aprocedure to derive the left hand side from the right hand side.5.3 Semant ic  St rueture  Ana lys isFor each constituent construction predicted, the semantic relationbetween modifier and modifieant in the construction is analyzed usingsemantic relation frames.
Depending on the differences in structuretypes of the modifierhnodifieant pair, different types of semanticrelations can be analyzed.
In addition, the word meanings of the wordstructure and the categories for the integrated structure can also beanalyzed.Semantic relation analysis can be explained by the analogy of akey and key-hole.
A modifieant has a number of possible key-holes,and a modifier can be regarded as the key which can match it.
Theprocedure is to search for the best matching key hole for the key.
Theshapes of keys and key-holes are determined by syntactic (caseparticles) and semantic (semantic ategory) information.The score given to the integrated structure represents the degreeof syntactic and semantic mismatch recognized in the integrationprocess.
It is represented by a two-dimensional vectm', whose firstargument is for syntantic mismatch, and second is for semanticmismatch.
At each stage of analysis, if  syntactic onstraint is notpattern-name: usent-pattern-1variables: (case-instance case-particle sequence usent)structure: structure-class= usentsubstructures:substructure: substructure-label1 = sub1structure-class = casepatterns = (.case-instance (restrict >case-particlecase-particlep))substructure: substructure-label2 = sub2structure-class = usentpatterns = (.sequence (restrict >usent usentp))semantic-analysis-function: (case-analysis subl sub2)Fig.
6 Example of Structure Pattern (Unit Sentence)The argument with the prefix symbol * can match any nanlber of elements, and theargument with the prefix symbol > can match asingle lement.624satisfied, two points are added to the syntactic mismatch score, and ifit is satisfied by modal particles, one 1-mint is added to it.
As forsemantic eon.~traints, if they are not satisfied, two points are added tothe semantic mismatch score, and if they are satisfied throughinheritance of semantic ategories, one point is added to it.5.4 Case Analys isCase analysis is the process of matching a ease instance andprototype ases in the case fl'ame and of selecting the best matchedprototype case.
Then, the value of the case relation between the caseinstance and the predicate is determined to be the case relation of theselected prototype case.A modifier element may have co-case slots.
It is true that somemodifiers are strongly associated with partlcular word meanings ofpredicate words.
I"or example, a verb "hiku ( iJI < )" has multiplemeanings, and its exact meaning in a sentence is determined when itoccurs simultaneously with object cases such as "kaze we hiku (~J{ N~~l < ) (catch a cold)", "jisho we hiku ( ~}~ {q~" ~" ~J\[ < ) (consult adictionary)" ancl "denwa we hiku ( 7E ;,~, ~ ~ I < ) (establish a telephoneservice)".
When a modifier element definitely determines the wordmeaning of a modifieant element, it is not efficient o test all possibleword meanings of the modificant.
Therefore, if the same case slot isshared by both a modifier and a modificant element, the meaningwhich shares this same case slot is selected as the word meaning ofboth elements without analysing another possibilities.5.5 Modal i ty  analys is  \[8\]The classification of modality information and the procedure foranalysing thmn have presented in the reference thus we will describehere only the outline.
Modality analysis consists of the followingthree modules combined with case analysis and conjunctive analysis:(l) Pro-ease-analysis:  A modality which causes a change in the casestructure is analyzed at this stage.
The case frame to be assigned tothe predicate is modified by util izing the result of this analysis beforestarting the ease analysis.
As for semantically ambiguous auxil iaryverbs which are also related to the modification of the case structure,their role is only predicted at this stage, and after case analysis, thelikelihood of the prediction is evaluated.
(2) Post-ease-analysis:  A medaiity whose analysis requires casestructure information is analysed at this stage as follows :a) If the category of the modality expression is unique, this categoryis assigned to the nmaning structure.b) If a daemon (a procedure to resolve ambiguities using heuristics)is attached to the modality expression, it performs the followingthree tasks: i) disambiguating the category of the nmdality word,ii) determining the operational scope of the modality, iii) addingthe implicative meaning caused by the modality word.
(3) Post-conjunet ive-analys ls :  Following the conjunctive analysisbetween the subordinate clause and the main clause, this module isactivated to determine whether the medality in the main clause alsooperates on the subordinate clause.
For negation in the main clause,the transfer of negation is considered.
'resting whether or not themodifier event is subsidiary to the oceurenee of the main event isaccomplished using the semantic relation frames assigned to thepredicate of the main clause.5.6 Determinat ion of Word MeaningWord meaning is an entry fl'mn a word to the conceptual networkconsisting of dictionary information and knowledge.
Since a word hasmultiple word meanings, it is possible that the word might havemultiple entries.
The information available for the determination ofword meaning is the accumulated situation (discourse information)and the accumulated word meanings (accumulated concepts).
If nosuch information is available, a default value is borrowed as the mostlikely word meaning.
In the early stage of semantic relation analysis,tentative word meanings are assumed.
These word meanings may notbe accurate because they have heen determined solely by the localanalysis.
It is possihle that some of the rejected meanings at thisstage might be more adequete as the exact word meanings for a givenword in the context of the entire sentence.
Therefore, the system mustretain all possible word meanings as candidates so that it can changethe meanings after obtaining enough information to determine theexact meaning.5.7 Determinat ion  of CategoryAt the st;tge of building a meaning structure for a sentence,categories for each constituent structure are also deterlnined.Categories for a structure are usually the same as the categories ofthe head constituent.
But if a structure is exoeentrie, categories forthe structure can be obtained by some operation on its constituentsubstructures.
For example, tile category for "omocha no heitai ( }S g/5 ~ ~') 3~ t~) (a toy soldier)" is non-animate, although the category of"heitai (>fg IN) (a soldier)" is hmnan (therefore, animate).In order to determine the categories of asmnant ical ly  anabigvtousstructure or a exoeentrie structure, an attached procedure is invoked.For example, the Japanese noun "tame ( ?d &)" is ambiguous becauseit has two categories, purpose and cause.
To resolve this ambiguity, adaemon is invoked after the noun phrase containing "tame" isanalyzed.
'Phi,.
; daemon performs tile following heuristics:1) If "tame" is followed lay both a ease particle "ni ( l.= )" and a modalparticle "ha ( 12)" (that is, in ease of"tameuiha ( & a5 l= I~)" form),the category is determined to be "purpose".2) If "tame' is  ucceeded lay an embedded sentence and the predicateshows a perfective aspect (that is, the end part of tile embeddedsentence contains the auxil iary verb "ta ( t:)" or "teiru ( -C ~' 7o )"),or the semantic ategory of the predicate is "state", the category isdetermined to be "cause".3) Otherwise, "purpose".6.
T rans fer6.1 Trans fer  Funct ionsDiscrepancies among ECS's for different languages arise forseveral reasons.
One is essential in nature.
We believe that syntacticinformation should be preserved as far as possible in FCS.
Butsemantically equivalent information is often realized differently inthe syntax of different languages.
Conceputual systems are alsodifferent in different language communities.
These differences mustbe reflcctcd in BCS's.Transfer process should fill these gaps between the ECS's of twodifferent languages.
At the transfer stage from Japanese to English,structures, relations and concepts in J-ECS arc transferred into thosein g-ECS.
Since concepts and relations are integrated into structures,the transfer of concepts and relations is performed at the same time asthe transfer of structures.6.2 Trans fer  of e lements  of ECSIn the course of the transfer processes, ECS's in the sourcelanguage are converted by reeursively traversing original structuresfrom top nodes, and creating corresponding target structures.
So, thetransfer process consists of transfering components of the ECS's, i.e.,concepts that make up the ECS and relations which hold among them.13ut there are cases which don't suit this scheme well, and hencerequire special treatment.
They are idiosyncratic to \[exical items andspecific procedures have to be triggered by certain concepts includedin the original structm'es.
Idiosyncratic transformations include:1) delctlon: certain structures in the source structures are deletedand no counterpart structures are embodied in target structures;for example, eomt~ound structures are transferred into primitivestruetures, as in the transfer from "Sakana we tsuru ( ,((t ~" $"; .,.o )"in Japanese to "fish" in l'haglish,2) addition: certain structures Ihat have no counterpart in the sourcestructures are added to target structures; for example, primitivestructures In'o transferred into compound structures, as in timtransfer from "Samidare ( .It J\] H:i)" in Japanese into "earlysummer ain" in English, and3) modifieation: .~;ource structures are non-trivially changed in theprocess of transfer, as in the transfer 5'om Japanese adjectivesentence "Jisuu ga eel ( :-~: ~ \ ] /~g v, )" into Plnglish "There are ..."sentence structure, or types of input and output are different, as inthe transfer from Japanese phrase "... suru toM (... -4" Za II~'i,)"("time" case instance) into the English subordinate clauseconstruetion "Whel~ ...".The transfer ef concepts consists of 1) transfer of semanticcategories, and 2) transfer of word meanings.
A transfer dictionaryfor a pair of languages is prepared to give information on theeorrespondence b tween concepts in hoth languages.
An entry of thedictionary consists era triad or fi'alnes, that is, a source concept fi 'ame,a target concept flame, and a mediating frame.
Since conceptcorrespondence is in general not one-to-one, there may be severaltarget concepts given one source concept and vice versa.
Mediatingfi'ames can provide infm'mation on conditions to make it possible tochoose auaong alternatives.
Concepts that would trigger idiosyncraticprocedm:es lmve the information in the dictionary in the form oftransfer ules.Transfer of relations consists of transfer of four types of relationsdescribed in 3.3.
Correspondence information is also placed in thetransfer dictionary.
But inforlnation on case relation transfer arestored as verbal concepts, since they might be specific to individualverbs or classes of verbs.6.3 Trans fer  processThe transfer process is essentially a manipulation of fl'amenetworks.
A rule-based system was devised to facilitate easyspecification of the complex pattern of network manipulations.
Auexample of the transfer ule is shown in Figure 7.
Similar to structurepatterns, a transfer rule consists of three parts: a matching part,execution part, and a return part.
The matching part specifies theconditions under which the rule should be invoked.
It also containsvariables, which are bound during matching process and theinformation will be passed to and used in the later stage when thematching is successful.
The execution part specifies the transfer ofsubstructures and concepts, value assignment o the variables,fnrther conditional branching, and other operations.
Lisp code can heinvoked in this part.
The return part specifies the target structurethat has to be construeted and returned on the basis of tile applicationof the entire rule.

7 Example of transfer ule (Unit sentence)625The frame system presented here has a elass-lnstanee hierarchy,which adopts an "object-oriented" style of implementation for theframe network manipulation i the transfer process.
Transfer rulesspecifying how the network should he handled are written for eachtype of structm'es.
These are converted into executable forms, andattached to class frames of the structure as methods.
When the topnode of the input ECS is given a "transfer" message, correspondingmethods in the class frame, to the instances of which the top nodebelongs, will be invoked and handle the network as is specified in theoriginal rules.7.
LUTE ExperimentsThe LUTE is an experimental machine translation systembetween Japanese and English developed by applying ~heinvestigations mentioned above.
The dictionary of each language hasabout 3000 entries.
It has been implemented on a Symbellcs Lisp-machine by using ZetaI,isp.
The size of the system is 850KB ofprograms and 4MB of dictionaries and knowledge,LUTE was not deveIoped for practical use but to provide a part ofthe computer environment, RESOLUTE (Reclprocal Envlronment forthe Study o_f Language .Understander, ~J_'ranslator & Editor), on whichtheoretical works concerning computational linguistics can beexamined.
As a result, IZ/"~SOLUTE contains many facilities for man-machine interaction via a multi window screen and consists mainly ofa frame editor and facilities for conducting program executing.
Inthis environment, it is possible to pertbrm translation experimentssuch as analyzing texts, transfering the meaning structures,generating phrases and sentences, developlng dictionaries, editingknowledge base and examining programs both separately andsimultaneously.
For example, I UTE can regenerate a sentence of theGBJ g &glii;~ ?

Also, any intermediate representation can bemodified to examine the transfer and generation as a whole or a part.Since all of the data are represented in a frame network, thisenvironment system provides a general fi'amework for frame-manipulation facilities.
