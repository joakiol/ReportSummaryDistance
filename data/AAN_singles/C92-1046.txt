It is based on the theory of tensesof H. Kamp and Ch.
Rohrer.
The system uses tiletense and aspect information, the information aboutthe temporal discourse structure of tile preceding textstored in a specific list of possible reference times, andbackground knowledge.
These types of informationinteract in order to choose a suited temporal anchorfor the event of a new sentence.With respect o extended texts, choosing the rightreference time for a new event is a problem which hasbeen largely neglected in the literature.1 IntroductionIn Reichenbach (1947) the tenses are analyzed intodifferent orderlngs of the relevant emporal parame-ters which are: the time of the event talked about,the speech time (time of utterance) and the referencetime.
Simple past, for instance, identifies event- andreference-time, which are both before the speech time.In the case of past perfect he event time precedes thereference time which precedes the speech time.Kanlp attd Rohrer (1983,1985) were led by text-phenomena to split up the Reichenbachian referencetime into two contextually given coordinates: the ref-erence time (in the narrow sense) and the temporalperspective time.
(1) Harry handed the book about giraffes to Jane (el).Two hours ago he had descovered it in Alfred's book-shop (e2).
He had bought it (es), had inserted a dedi-cation (e4) and had it wrapped up (e~).
Jane took thebook with a smile (e~)In (1), the events e2 - e5 are ordered consecutively,*This research as been done in the context of LILOG.Thanks on this way to the members of the LILOG-researehgroup of IBM for helpfull comments and especially for havingmade the integration of the suggested system in the LILOG-prototype possible.each taking its predecessor as reference time, withthe exception that the context does not provide auevent which precedes e2 and which, therefore, couldplay the role of reference time with respect to e2.Tile whole sequence 2 - es is seen from a vantagepoint in the past, el, which, therefore, plays the roleof perspective time with regard to the structural inte-gration of e2 - c5.
The perspective from which e 1 andes are seen is the speech tinle, e t serves as referencetime for c~.
In the approach of Kamp and Rohrer therole that the reference time plays in Reichenbach'ssystem is taken over by the perspective time with re-spect to the meaning of the tenses in single sentencediscourses: The meaning (one of tile meanings) of pastperfect is that the event tittle precedes the perspec-tive time which precedes the speech time.
The mean-ing of simple past is that  the event time precedesthe speech time which coincides with tile perspec-tive time.
However, in addition to a system like Re-ichenbach's there is another parameter which comesexclusively from the text, the reference time proper,which is part of tile impact of the tenses on the tem-poral reconstruction of a narrative, titus completingthe sentential meaning of the tenses by a textual as-pect.
Here, the idea, that  we take over from Kampand P~ohrer, is that in a sequence of simple past sen-tences introducing events (not states) normally theevent of a new senteuce follows the reference timewhich is provided by the event of the preceding sen-tence within the sequence.
By transposition the sameshould hold for sequences of past perfect sentences.Here, the perspective is shifted from the speech timeto a (contextually given) point in the past.
There isan additional feature however with respect o tem-poral parameters.
Adverbials can provide a locationtime for events and states.
For instance, in (1), the 1o.cation time of e2 is the time pointed to by two hoursago.On the basis of the Reichenbachian pproach us-ing three temporal parameters the problem of inte-grating a new event in the event structure of tilepreceding text has been attacked by Hinrichs (1986),Partee(1984) and others.
More independant of thisapproach are suggestions made by Moens and Steed-malt (1988} aatd by Webber(1988).AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 nOt\]T 1992 2 8 8 PRO<:.
OF COLING-92, NANTES, AU6.23-28, 1992Since we tllink tltat it correct anMysis of narra-tives eamlot do without a fine grained distinction be-tween the roles played by temporal  anchors, our ap-lu'oach uses the coordinates uggested by Kamp andPtnllrer.
Such coordinates arc stored in a structuredlist., called T-list, which rettects the discourse struc-ture of the preceding text.
The l)rol)lem of choosingtim right anchor for the new event froln the precedingtext is largely neglected in thc l iterature.
Very oftenthere, tile preceding text consists of only one sentenceor tile problem is restricted to thc intra-sentential onepresented by temporal  conjunctions.
How do we de-cide in (1) that  the reference t ime for ca is not tile ear-lier introduced el, but e2 and that  the reference tinlefor e(t is not the most recent reference t ime es, butel': hi our system we use tile structure of the T-listaluong other things to get a hierachy of the topicalityof tile rcfi~'renee times.
This is very ch)se to tim ideaof accessibility in Discourse Rel)resentatiou Theory(Kamp (1981)) and to tile notion of focus in the workof Grosz and Sidner (1985).
Ill or(ler to tackle tile taskof event-integration, which we call " temporM resolu-tion" - slaking Mhtsion to the very similar probtelnof the NP-resohltion, where anaphoric links for thec~me of nominals have to be established - we struct~.lrcthe T-list along the lines of different discourse rcla-tions such ms continuation, elaboration, flashback etc.Fla-sllback, for instance, holds in the example abovebetween e 1 alld e 2 and between el alld e3.
Tile re-lation between e2 and c3 is contimmtion.
As we willset' ill the section after next, often, fi'om the purelylinguistic l)oint of view timre are alternatives withresl)ect to the decision about the discourse relationwhich directs the iutegration of a new event or state.Ill our system, the criteria to decide about therelevant discourse relation are provided by tile tensefi)rlus of the reference vent(s) and of the new eventrespectively, by tile existence aairl the elmracteristicsof temporal  adverbiMs, by the ,aspect of the events - isit all event proper or a state - and by internal se.luanticproperties of the events whicil are made explicit bymeans t)f rules stored ill the background knowledge.Of course, in addition, tile hierarchically structuredT-list inflnences tile cltoice and helps to update thesystem correctly, where updat ing means adding a newtelnporal condition to the representation of the textand a(lding a new refereltee t ime to tim T-list at, aspecific l)htee.In tlm next section we will briefly introduce tilekind of discourse representation structures that  weuse.
Then we wilt say something about  the discourserelations deidt with and we l)resent ile syntax of tileT-list.
After tltat we sketch the relevant backgroundknowledge and finally, we give some of the resolutionrules of tilt' system.The structur ing of tile T-list extents a suggestionof Eberle and Kasper (1989) and comprises elenlentsof a proposal by Reyle (1986).Tile algorithm suggested is part of the LILOG-prototype witich is used for text understanding.
InAffl\]~s DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOrdr 1992particular it uses kaowledge provided by tile knowl-edge base and the inference component of the proto-type.2 DR;F and  EventsWitidn tile framework of Discourse RepresentationTheory (DRT) (Kamp(1981))  a Discourse Represen-tation Structure (D1LS) is a pair < U,K  > consistingof a set U of discourse referents (DRFs) and a metK of conditions.
DRSs are interpreted modeltheoret-ically.
DRT uses a variant of tim Davidsonian methodof talking about events: timy are treated as a kind ofobjects.In L ILOG we use DRSs for text representiLtions.But we deviate front the cla.~sicM Dl~F-style in us-ing one-placc event predicates and thematic roles in-stead of n-place ew;nt predicates.
A second differenceis given \]W the fact that in L1LOG DllSs come withall indcx.
The index is the list of reference tinles avail-able with respect o the DRS ill question.
For a simplesentence it will bc a list consisting only of one element- the DRF of the event introduced - for a text it willlie a COmlllcx list, tit(: T-list.So, for instance, the LIL()G-DILS for cominy o\]xcan be illustrated i~s follows:a(le~tt(e) = xFor the \])ITS to be valid there must exist an em-bedding function which nmps e onto an event of themodel structure such that e satisfies tile conditions asdescribed ill the I)RS.3 Discourse  Re la t ionsIt is clear that the idea about tile order of eventsintroduced by sequences of sentences that wc havesketched in the introduction is an oversilnpfification.Iu the folh)wing we will restrict ourselves to thetenses prevailing in narrativcs, silnple past and pastperfect, and to only some of the text pl lenomena re-lated to these tenses (as we have done ill tile L ILOGilnl)lelnentation with respect o tile German counter-parts of these tenses).
}3csi(les tile disl:ourse relations used ill CXalnple(1), i.e.
tl~shback and continuation, there are at leasttwo nlore, which we call elabo~vltlon and backgTound.Conlpare the two fi)\]lowing exalllples:(2) Mouday Hans went to Par~s.
Tuesday he metGabt.
(3) Monday Hans went to Paris.
At the border he hadsome trouble.
(2) dcscril)es a continuation.
This can lie deducedfrom the characteristics of the location times.2 8 9 PRec.
oY COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992In contrast o that, (3) describes an elaboration.We call the relation between a new event e2 and itsreference vent el an elaboration, if e2 describes eton a nmre fine-grained level (which gives rise to thetemporal condition of inclusion (C_) between the newevent and tile reference vent within the representa-tion of the text).In (3) the relation of elaboration can be deducedonly if there is some input from the knowledge baseequipping the resolution component with facts aboutjourneys to foreign countries.
Notice that, here, thetemporal inclusion is due to the hommnorphic localinclusion of tile border into the path of the travel.This illustrates that an intelligent temporal resolutimtcomponent cannot do without having access to localreasoning.Now compare the following pair of examples,taken from Dowty (1986) and from Hinrichs (1986)respectively:(4) John entered the president's office.
The clock onthe wall ticked loudly.
(5) Jameson entered the room, shut the door carefullyand switched off the hght.
It was pitch-dark aroundhint because the venetian blinds were closed.hi both (4) and (5) the last sentence introduces notall event proper, but a state.
As widely accepted, thenormal case of relating a new state e2 to an exist-ing reference vent el seems to be that of inelusiml(e, C_ e2).
lHowever, as exaalples like (5) make clear, tills de-fault can be overwritten.
Here ton, it seems that back-grmmd knowledge gives the decisive indication aboutwhen the default has to be upset.We call the discourse relation of (4) backgroundand that of (5) causally introduced background.
Forcases like (5) we introduce tile new state e~ a.s fol-lowing the actual reference vent el (el -< e2) andas including a dummy reference time t (t C e:) withrespect o which e2 introduces a backgrouud, ht thefilrther course of processing the text, t has to be in-stautiated by a new event which is understood as fol-lowing el.The T-list makes use of these discourse relationsa-s structuring elements.
For instance, processing thesamlfle text (6), which integrates tile text phenomenareflected by the examples (1) - (4), should result in arepresentation which has as index the T-list (7):{6) John left Paris by the Porte de 5 ~ Cloud late inthe evening (el).
He went to Frankfort (e2).At the border he was stopped (e3).
It was pretty dark(e J .
Only a .few lights were burning (es).
He had toopen hz.~ boot (es).
In Paris he had bought five cartonsof e:garettes (e7) and had hidden them in the car (es).The customs officers missed them (eg}.IThis parallels, for instance, the insights of Partee(1984),H inrichs( 1986l, Kamp and Rohrer(1985) and others.Early in the morning John entered a bar near themess tower in Frankfort (elo), ordered a beer (el1)and lighted a cigarette (el2).
He was happy (eta).

The secondof these chains elaborates an event of the first, e2,tile transition to Prankfort (e l / \ ) .
e4 and e~ serve asbackground to ea, cla is the background ofe12 (bg / \ ) .Finally, the continuation chain c7 - ea is a flashbackseen from the perspective es.We define tile accessibility of all event as referenceevent in such a way that, having processed the wholetext, the only accessible event will be elz, whereas, inthe case of having processed the text till the integra-tion of es, the accessible vents will be es, es and e2(with decreasing prominettce).
In this situation es isthe so called actual reference vent.
When integrat-ing a new sentence, one will try to expand the noderepresented by the actual referent first.
But, finally,what level has to be chosen and what kind of anchor-ing has to be stored in the next step is decided bythe system rules.
So, for instance, in the case of (6),by purely linguistic reasons, ea cannot be related totile actual reference event e8, because there is a tenseswitch from past perfect o simple past between esand es which indicates the termination of the flash-back.
This results in tile re-initialization of the levelttle flashback started from as the level providing thenew actual referent.
In the case of (6) this is cs whichis a member of an elaboration.
Actual elaborationsmay be terminated by knowledge indicating that ex-panding the structure at the actual evel is not plau-sible or even not possible.
In this case the systemwill try to relate the new event with respect o tile(accessible) vents of higher levels of the elaborationhierarchy.
Since, with respect o (6), eg is compatiblewith e2 the system has no reason to terminate thelevel marked by e0.
We think that the data confirmthe concept of a hierarchy of reference vents as usedin the system.
The exact defiuition of the accessiblereference events of a T-list resides in the definition ofthe specific access-functions forT-lists that we sketchACTE.S DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOt~r 1992 2 9 0 PRec.

2In fact, ill tile LILOG implementation, tile itemsof the index, i.e.
of the.
T-list, do not consist of thepure events.
They are terms with different slots filledhy the relevant emporal information such ms tiletense form which introduces the corresponding event,the ,xspect, the actual speech tittle etc.
Skiplfing suchtechnical details, the simplified syntax of the T-list isthe following:T-list := \[\] ;\[E(D-list)JT-List\]whereE(D-List): list itemwithE: the discourse referent for the event, andD-List: tile list of the items depending on theevent,whereD-List := \[\];\[bg(\[E(\[\])lT'-List\])lD-List\];\[fl)(\[E(D-List)lW-List\]) \[D-List\];\[el(\[E(D-List )lT-ListD ID-List\];Here, of course, embeddings which are given by the di-mensions by, fb, elin turn stand for background, flash-back and elaboration.
T'-List is a T-list where eachD-list is the empty list.
We use T'-List for the items illbg-lists, because we do Ilot think that a backgroundgive rise to further embeddings.
The neighborhood ofT-list items of the same level signifies continuation,except he case where such a list is fl'onted by bg.
Inthis case, in the corresponding DtLS the elements ofthe list include the same event and, therefore, overlapeach other.
Continuation is reflected in the reversedorder, because we use T-list as a stack.
For (6), ac-cording to (7), we write (8).
Here mid in the followingwe abbreviate E(\[\]) by E:(8) \[el2(Ibg(\[elaD\]),e11,elO,e2(\[el(\[e9,e6(\[fb(\[eS,eT\])l),e3(\[bg(\[e5,e4l)\])\]),ellOf course, there are other discourse relations ~those mentioned.
Especially, if one tries to analysethe structure of texts on a more fine-grained levelthan the purely temporal one, the relations describedare not sufficient, others like explanation, contrast etc.are needed, s For lack of space, here, we can nothingsay about these.
The relations described are those2Anchoring new evetlts to non-accessible reference eventsclearly is possible, provided there is additional information tomotivate this clmice, such as, for instance, definite descrip-tions using event nomlnalizations in order to establish cc-referentiallty, But, at present, such possibilities are not im-plemented.3 Partly for other purposes discourse or rhetorical relationsare tlsed, for instance~ in Grosz and Sidner(1985}, Thompsonand Mann (1987}.dealt with ill tile LILOG system.4 Background KnowledgeThe LILOG knowledge base provides us with a sorthierarchy for discourse referents which is relatedwith respect o events to tile classification given inVendler(1967).
This sort hierarchy is used as one ofseveral information packages within the temporal res-olution.
With respect o the hierarchy we mainly usecalendar knowledge and incompatibilty-statementsabout event ypes.
For instance, all event introducedwith the location time 1987 (or with subintervals of1987) cannot overlap with an event with location time1988.
Exactly the same is true when the new event hasan event ype which is incompatible with the type ofthe reference vent.
A SWIMMING-event is incom-patible with a WRITING-event if tile relevant he-rustic roles are the same, i.e., here, the agent-role.
Ofcourse, when fornlulating such incompatibilities onetries to make use of the sort hierarchy.
One will definethe incompatibility for very general sorts (if possible)so that it is inherited by subsorts.Knowledge of this kind is hard information so tospeak.
In addition to this, the system uses defaultknowledge about event ypes which is similar to whatis cldled event f~nmes (cf.
Miusky (1975), Schank andAbelson (1977), Bartsch (1987) and others).
Typical(simplified) examples of the two kinds of knowledgeare (9) and (10):(9) VEI C MOVE, L E LOC(L c path(El) -~ 3E2 e PLACED-AT(theme(El) = theme(E.~) ^ E~ C_ E1 ))(10) VE~ E TURN, E.2 e BEING-LIGHTED(object(El) E L1GHT-SWITCIt A E~meetsE1 --*o3E3 e BEING-DARK (ElmeetsE:l))(9) regulates the localization of the theme of a move-meat.
From this rule we infer the existence of dif-ferent PLACED-AT-states for the thente within themovement.
(10) predicts that normally (D fl)r de-fault) turning a switch when it is lighted results indarkness.5 Temporal ResolutionThe construction of tile seulantic represeutation foradiscourse proceeds in several stages.
I shall skip herethe steps leading to the DRS of a sentence.
But it hasto be stressed that tile result of sentence processing isnot a completed DRS.
There may be variables whichhave to be instantiated in the process of integratingthe sentence-DRS into the text-DRS.The sentence-DRS is understood as the input ofthe aspect-calculus of the prototype which has tocontpute the aspect of the events of the DRS.
There-fore it uses tile inform~ttion provided by the thematicroles.
The starting point is the aspect-entry for theACTES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 ^OI3T 1992 2 9 1 PROC.

It can be overwritten by specificrole information and morphological information withregard to aspect.
For the sake of simplicity in the fol-lowing we assume that there are just two contrastingaspects corresponding to the main sorts of the upperstructure of the event sort hierarchy, the heteroge-neous events proper (ev) and the honmgeneous states(st).
The aspect calculus used is based on ideas fi'omKritka (1987)2So, for Peter wrote a book we will getthe aspect value ev, whereas for Peter wrote books wewill get st. For the example (6) we get that e4, es, el3are states, the rest will be analyzed as events proper.After tile computation of the aspect we come up withan indexed DRS its descrihed iu the second and thirdsection with the value of the aspect feature instanti-ated.Within the process of anchoring we use severalaccess-functions with respect o the T-list.
Amongother things these are act-tel(T-list) which gives usthe most topicalized item in the list, the actualreferent, el-embedder( T-list, E), fb-embedder( T-list,E)which givo us the points elaborations and flashbackscontaining E start from.
It has to be stressed that ref-erence vents have to be events proper.
They caunotbe states.
The actual referent is the first element ofthe stack, provided that this element does not contMnfl~hback- or elaboration-embcddings.
If it does westart the recursivc all of the search procedure withrespect o the first of these embedded lists, tense{El,aspect(El, and tp(E) give us the valnes of tile tenseand aspect features (sp, ppf, ev, st: simple past, pastperfect, event and state) and the temporal perspec-tive from which E is seen.In order to decide the anchoring of new events,the rules of the system make use of three filters:(F1) tile tense/aspect filter which decides whethera particular discourse relation is possible withrespect o tense and aspect,(F2) the "consistency" filter, which decides whethertile choice of a particular discourse relation islogically compatible with the information of thepreceding text against the background of tileinformation from the inference component ( hisconsists mainly of testing sort subsumptions illthe context of teml)oral incompatibilities be-tween calendar units and event sorts), and(F3) the evidence filter which tries to support therelation tested by means of rules like (9) and(10).To illustrate the system we restrict ourselves tosome simple eases (compare figure 1).

We skip ruleswhich deal with specific subcases of these relations.For instance, we skip rules which deal with dummyreferents t introduced by the causal background andrules which allow for more precise temporal localiza-tions of tile new events.
We use rewrite rules whichdepict the amalgamation f a sentence DRS with atext DRS.In rule 1.)

The anchoring of eT, es, el 1and el2 should be clear on the basis of what we havesaid so far.In order to arrive at alternative readings of a textwe use a specific backtracking routine which can sup-press the impact of (F3) for the resolution.6 Conc lus ionThe described system complltes the event stru(:ture ofa discourse.
Siuce we think that the semantics of tenseand aspect is not sufficient to establish tile temporaldlsfollrse llleallillg, we use backgl'ollnd kllowledge to?lisambiguate b tween different readings.The system is incomplete at present.
The frag-ment it deals with doesn't allow for relative clauses.
Inaddition the interactioa between NP-resolutlon andtemporal resolution is not available.
Some temporallyrelevant discourse relations are not treated.
The logictmderlying the preference relation is only rudimen-tary sketched.

OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992presented here is a condensed version of that sug-gested in Eberle (1991).
The corresponding imple-mentation for the LILOG prototype dates back to1989.
Meanwhile, independent of this approach, sim-ilar suggestions have been made (cLAsher and Las-carides (1991)).
In the work of Asher and Lascaridesthe underlying theory of non-monotonic reasoning isMASH (cf.
Asher and Morreau (1991)).
It is projectedto extract a suited proof theory from MASH for thepurpose of refining the temporal resolution compo-nent suggested, sReferences\[1\] Asher, N., Lazcarides.
