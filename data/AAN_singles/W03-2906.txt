It has been collec-ted since 2002 in the Institute of Linguistics,Faculty of Philosophy, University of Zagreb.The CML is planned to have two sub-lexi-cons: derivative/compositional and inflec-tional, both produced by a generator.
The re-sult of generation is lexicon as two distinctlists of generated combinations of morph-emes and complete word-forms both withadditional data that can be used in furtherprocessing.
The inflectional component ispresented more in detail in the second partof the paper.
At the end, the several possibleapplications of CML are discussed.IntroductionOur aim was to make a model of Croatian mor-phological system in the form of lexicon storedin a database.
The lexicon, named Croatian Mor-phological Lexicon (CML), would include allcombinations of morphemes according to mor-photactic rules and generated by two morpho-logical generators.1 Theoretical backgroundThe very idea of generating all possible com-binations of morphemes appeared in Halle(1973) for the first time in the framework ofgenerative grammar.
Although at that time itseemed that morphology could be represented asa compact subcomponent of the lexicon in thegenerative grammar, that concept posed severaltheoretical problems.
The most severe one wasdefining the criteria for filtering-out non-estab-lished, yet possible combinations of morphemes.In fact this very approach negated the compact-ness of morphology since the derivative mor-phology was separated from inflectional.Later research in generative and lexical pho-QRORJ\FILQ0LKDOMHYL?VHSDUDWHGderivative subcomponent from inflectional evenmore by introducing several layers where differ-ent types of rules appeared in different contexts(prefixation, suffixation, composition, inflec-tion...).
Not only rules but also the mode of theirapplication resulted in different patterningschemes, particularly on two poles of that con-tinuum of layers (rigidness of paradigms vs.non-rigidness of derivative system, symmetricityof paradigms vs. non-symmetricity of derivativesystem, cyclic rules in derivation vs. non-cyclicrules in inflection etc.
).Recently, there has been several contributionsthat were aimed at modeling the morphologicalsystems of other Slavic languages with lexiconslike Vetulani (2000) for Polish, Kl?mova andKocek (2000) and particularly Osolsob  et al(2002) for Czech as well as Rojc et al (2002) forSlovenian.Our idea of modeling the morphology of Croa-tian was somewhere along that track but wewanted to keep the model as simple as possibleand use the computational data from the researchalready completed for Croatian2 Structure of the CMLAlready described concept of dividing a modelof the morphological system of Croatian waskept along but in its simplified form i.e.
con-sisting of only two components:1. derivation/composition: modeled as a listof lexical and a list of derivative morphemeswith rules for their combining.1 A derivatio-nal generator could produce all possiblecombinations of lexical with derivativemorphemes regardless of their existence inreal texts.
Each combination is not inde-pendent combination of morphemes (itequals the stem in traditional grammar), butit serves as the input for the second compo-nent.
The cumulative result of generation ofall possible combinations on that level couldbe called ?derivative capacity?
of a languageVHH7DGL?2. inflection: modeled as a list of generatedstems and a list of inflectional morphemeswith rules for their combining.
The inflec-tional generator produces the final word-forms along the paradigms and with regardto inflectional patterns for Croatian as de-fined and described in detail in Tadi?Each generated morpheme combination (fromboth components) should be accompanied byadditional data which could give us the possibil-ity to backtrack the generation or use that datafor further processing.Each of the sub-lexicons of CML has differentformat covering different linguistic units andaccompanying data.2.1 Stem lexiconFor stem lexicon the format is still under con-sideration but it could look like this:SUR_GD_Y_D?_LFGDSOVVV1$Iwhere SURGDYD?LF (roughly: selleress-) isgenerated combination of morphemes, GD islexical morpheme or root, SOVVVis a deri-vational pattern describing the morphotacticordering of morphemes.
The S, O, V, VandVcould serve in database as pointers to the listsof morphemes.
The 1$I is a tag denoting nomenagentis of feminine gender.
This system of deri-vational tags is still under construction and itshould be submitted to further discussion andpossible cross-Slavic-language examination and,1Composition in this case is treated as special varietyof derivation because the combination of two (or insome cases more) lexical morphemes behaves like asingle lexical morpheme in further derivative process.hopefully, some standardization as well.
Havingin mind the closeness of Slavic languages, itseems that some kind of common recommenda-tion may be achieved at least at the very basiclevel of unified list of derivational patterns andgeneral semantic categories which are, in somelanguages more and in some less systematically,represented by certain derivational affixes.
In-troducing additional semantic information tothat kind of lexicon could also be importantbecause overlapping of derivational and seman-tic system is not always uniform and there is noexception-free 1:1 mapping.
This kind of re-source could be of a help to lexicographers,lexical semanticians, terminologists etc.2.2 Inflectional lexiconUnlike derivation, for inflection there is alreadyestablished standard for inflectional lexicon andtag system in the form of MulTextEast v2 rec-ommendation (Erjavec 2001) with definition forCroatian dated from 1998.DEHFHGD1FIVQDEHFHGHDEHFHGD1FIVJDEHFHGLDEHFHGD1FIVGDEHFHGXDEHFHGD1FIVDDEHFHGRDEHFHGD1FIVYDEHFHGLDEHFHGD1FIVODEHFHGRPDEHFHGD1FIVLDEHFHGHDEHFHGD1FISQDEHFHGDDEHFHGD1FISJDEHFHGDPDDEHFHGD1FISGDEHFHGHDEHFHGD1FISDDEHFHGHDEHFHGD1FISYDEHFHGDPDDEHFHGD1FISODEHFHGDPDDEHFHGD1FISLDEROLFLMD1FIVQDEROLFLMHDEROLFLMD1FIVJDEROLFLMLDEROLFLMD1FIVGDEROLFLMXDEROLFLMD1FIVDDEROLFLMRDEROLFLMD1FIVYDEROLFLMLDEROLFLMD1FIVODEROLFLMRPDEROLFLMD1FIVLDEROLFLMHDEROLFLMD1FISQDEROLFLMDDEROLFLMD1FISJDEROLFLMDPDDEROLFLMD1FISGDEROLFLMHDEROLFLMD1FISDDEROLFLMHDEROLFLMD1FISYDEROLFLMDPDDEROLFLMD1FISODEROLFLMDPDDEROLFLMD1FISLSample from MTE conformant generated list ofword-forms for nouns abeceda and abolicija.3 Inflectional generationWhile the derivational generator remains to beconstructed, the inflectional generator for thewhole inflectional system was constructed andGHVFULEHG LQ 7DGL?  ,W FRQVLVWV RI WKUHHlists: lemmas (lexicon), endings, and transforma-tions.3.1 LexiconIn the lexicon, lemmas (as headwords) are ac-companied by minimal amount of data: onlystems and inflectional pattern number(s).

In total there are613 inflectional patterns where 404 patterns arefor nouns, 42 for adjectives, 12 for comparisonand 155 for verbs.
Up to three different inflec-tional patterns (or paradigms) of the same typeare allowed per verbal lemma because there areverbs which can change its word-forms accord-ing to different patterns.
Up to four differentpatterns are allowed for lemmas that are nounsand adjectives because there are instances ofparallel word-forms with the same MSD.
Foradjectives with comparison, [ and ] are bothobligatory.In order to keep the model flat and easily acces-sible for further linguistic refinement, no opti-mization has been done from the computationalpoint of view.3.2 List of endingsEndings are represented like ordered n-tuplesincluding morphosyntactic categories with theirexact values realizing at certain position in in-flectional pattern.
For substantives it looks likethis:HQGLQJ SDWSDUQXPFDV!where pat is pattern (1-404), par is paradigm (1-4), num is number (1-2) and cas is case (1-7).For adjectives it is a bit more complicated:HQGLQJ SDWSDUJHQQXPFDV!with pattern (1-42) and addition of gender (1-3).For verbs the endings are defined like this:HQGLQJ SDWWHQQXPSHUJHQ!with pattern (1-155), tense (1-9) which includesparticiple forms, and person/gender (1-3) withperson appearing in finite forms (tenses 2-5) andgender in participles (6-7).The comparison endings are defined with:HQGLQJ SDWJUD!with pattern (1-12) and grade (1-3).Endings are distributed by types in differenttables which are being accessed by usage ofcoordinates described in n-tuples.3.3 List of transformationsThe transformations are allowed only on stemsand are closely connected with inflectional pat-terns.
Precise classification of patterns accordingto the phonological composition of the stemsenables the controlled context of application ofquite simple transformational rules and keepstheir number as low as 35 for the whole inflec-tional system.
The order of applying transfor-mation rules is also strictly defined.The lists of transformations are stored in tables,which are isomorphous to the tables with end-ings and are being accessed the same way.
Sincethe transformations of the stems are pattern andending dependent, they can be done before finalconcatenation with endings.This system of transformations, coupled withprecise classification of inflectional patterns,covered all allomorphy of Croatian inflectionalstems including the most complicated cases (e.g.verbs of 1st class).4 ImplementationFor generation of inflectional lexicon the head-ZRUGOLVWRI$QL?Croatian dictionary hasbeen used.
Each headword was associated withinflectional pattern thus forming a lexicon withca 36.000 lemmas (18.019 substantives, 7735verbs, 5504 adjectives, 64 pronouns, 6517 ad-verbs, etc.)
The periphrastic verbal tenses werenot being generated in whole but only their par-ticiple parts.
Also no reflexive pronouns wereincluded in generation of reflexive verbs so onthat level there is no distinction between non-reflexive and reflexive verbs.2 The main reasonfor exclusion of periphrastic tenses and reflexiveverb word-forms was the in the idea to use in-flectional lexicon in initial POS tagging ofCroatian texts.
Coping with this verbal word-forms would complicate the task at this point.The generation of word-forms yielded 171380word-forms for nouns, 232276 word-forms forverbs, 1207786 word-forms for adjectives, and11706 word-forms for adverbs.4.1 UsageThe fully generated inflectional lexicon is beingsubmitted to thorough inspection in order tocorrect possible errors.
It will be used inPOS/MSD tagging of Croatian National Corpus(HNK).3 The subset of HNK of 1 million tokensis composed and it will be matched with inflec-tional lexicon.
Since there is no data of that kindfor Croatian yet, in this way all possible MSDreadings at the unigram level of each token willbe made available.
The ?inflectional weight?
and2The idea to exclude the periphrastic part of theverbal paradigm from inflection completely and totreate it on different level i.e.
syntactically may notsound so utterly heretic at this point.
Since Slaviclanguages are more-or-less free order languages, theposition of auxiliary is sometimes far away from theparticiple and this can only lead to inflectionalanalysis which has to take in account the sentencestructure.
This idea has been tacitly adopted inproducing the most of inflectional generators.3See in Tadi??homographic weight?
could be calculated foreach token giving additional data for furtherprocessing.
After (semi-)manual disambiguationand correction, that corpus will be used as atraining corpus for a tagger.44.2 AvailabilityThe inflectional lexicon of CML will be avail-able for querying at the Croatian HLT web-por-tal5 giving all word-forms of requested lemma.Beside linguists and other researchers, it will beuseful to students of Croatian who want to findor check the proper inflection of words.
It willbe useful even to a wider public as a tool forweb search because the output will allow simplelink to all word-forms in web-search query win-dow thus enabling the inflectionally sensitivesearch of Croatian web-pages.Sample window with results of querying CMLConclusionThe paper presented the work done so far onbuilding the Croatian Morphological Lexicon.While derivative sublexicon was covered only4See the results for Slovene in Erjavec et al (2000).The adaptation of tagset in several iterations or levelsof complexity will probably be necessary.5At http://www.hnk.ffzg.hr/jthj.with theoretical discussion, which needs furthercross-Slavic languages refinement and possiblestandardization, the inflectional sublexicon waspresented in detail.
This sublexicon isMULTEXT-East conformant and uses MSD tagsdefined in the scope of that project.
Several pos-sible uses of inflectional sublexicon were alsosuggested, among which the most widely usefulcan be the possibility to use all word-forms of alemma in the web-search engine such as Google,AltaVista etc.AcknowledgementsThe work on CML presented here has been donein the frame of the i-project 2002-100 granted bythe Ministry of Science and Technology of theRepublic of Croatia.ReferencesAni? 9  5MH?QLN KUYDWVNRJD MH]LND 1RYLOLEHU=DJUHES(UMDYHF 7 ?
