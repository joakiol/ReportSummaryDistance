The result of their efforts turned out to bemore fundamental in that it provided a general theoretical basis for the study of language use as a process,giving rise eventually to constraint-based grammatical formalisms for syntax, finite-state approaches tomorphology and phonology, and a host of models how speakers might assemble sentences, and hearerstake them apart.
Recently, an entirely new enterprise, based on machine learning and big data, has sprungon the scene and challenged the ALPAC committee?s finding that linguistic processing must have a firmbasis in linguistic theory.
In this talk, I will show that the long-term development of linguistic processingrequires linguistic theory, sophisticated statistical manipulation of big data, and a third component whichis not linguistic at all.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.
