mxAbstractIn this paper a discussion on multimodalreferent resolution is presented.
Thediscussion is centered on the analysis of howthe referent of an expression i  one modalitycan be found whenever the contextualinformation required for carrying on such aninference is expressed in one or moredifferent modalities.
In particular, a modelfor identifying the referent of a graphicalexpression when the relevant contextualinformation is expressed through naturallanguage is presented.
The model is alsoapplied to the reciprocal problem ofidentifying the referent of a linguisticexpression whenever a graphical context isgiven.
In Section 1 of this paper the notionof modality in terms of which the theory isdeveloped is presented.
The discussion ismotivated with a case of study inmultimodal reference resolution.
In Section2 a theory for multimodal representationalong the lines of Montague's semioticprogramme is presented.
In Section 3, anincremental model for multimodal referenceresolution is illustrated.
In Section 4 a briefdiscussion of how the theory could beextended to handle multimodal discourse isadvanced.
Finally, in the conclusion of thepaper, a reflexion on the relation betweenspacial deixis and anaphora is advanced.1 Reference and MultimodalityConsider Figure 1 (adapted from an example presentedby Thomas Rist in the past workshop on IMMPS atECAI 96) in which a message is expressed through twodifferent modalities, namely text and graphics.I o c>-J"He washed it"Figure 1The figure illustrates a kind of reasoning requiredto understand multimodal presentations: in order tomake sense of the message, the interpreter must realizewhat individuals are referred to by the pronouns heand it in the text.
For the sake of argument, it isassumed that the graphical symbols in the figure areunderstood directly in terms of a graphical lexicon, inthe same way that the words he, it and washed areunderstood in terms of the textual lexicon.
It can easilybe seen that given the graphical context he shouldresolve to the man, and it should resolve to the car.However, this inference is not a valid deduction sincethe information inferred to is not contained in the overtgraphical context and the meaning of the wordsinvolved.One way to look at this problem is as a case ofanaphoric inference.
Consider that the informationprovided by graphical means can be expressed alsothrough the following piece of dicourse: There is aman, a car and a bucket.
He washed it.
With Kamp'sdiscourse representation theory (DRT) (Kamp 1981,Kamp et.
al.
1993) a discourse representation structure(DRS) in which the reference to the pronoun he isconstrained to be the man can be built.
However, thepronoun it has two possible antecedents, and for100 L.A.  P ineda and G. Garzaselecting the appropriate one, conceptual knowledge isrequired.
In particular, the knowledge that a man canwash objects with water, and that water is carried on inbuckets must be employed.
If these concepts areincluded in the interpretation context like DRTconditions (which should be retrieved from memoryrather than from the normal flow of discourse), theanaphora can be solved.
In terms of this analogy,situations like the one illustrated in Figure 1 have beenlabeled as problems of anaphor with pictorialantecedent in which the interpretation context is builtnot from a preceeding text but from a graphicalrepresentation which is introduced with the text (Andr6et al, 1994).Consider now the reciprocal situation shown inFigure 2 (adapted from Rist as above) in which adrawing is interpreted as a map thanks to thepreceeding text.
The dots and lines of the drawing, andtheir properties, do not have an interpretation and thepicture in itself is meaningless.
However, given thecontext introduced by the text, and also considering thecommon sense knowledge that Paris is a city of France,and Frankfurt a city of Germany, and that Germanylies to the east of France (to the right), it is possible toinfer that the denotations of the dots to the left, middleand right of the picture are Paris, Saarbriicken andFrankfurt, respectively, and that the dashed linesdenote borders of countries, and in particular, thelower segment denotes the border between France andGermany.
In this example, graphical symbols can bethought of as "variables" of the graphicalrepresentation or "graphical pronouns" that can beresolved in terms of the textual antecedent.
Here again,the inference is not a valid deduction as the graphicalsymbols could be given other interpretations or non atall.
"Saarbriicken lies at the intersectionbetween the border between France andGermany and a line from Paris toFrankfurt.
"./Figure 2The situation in Figure 2 has been characterised asan instance of a pictorial anaphor with linguisticantecedent, and further elated examples can be foundin (Andr6 et al, 1994).
This situation, however,cannot be modeled that easily in terms of Kamp's DRTbecause the "pronouns" are not linguistic objects, andthere is not a straight forward way to express in a thediscourse representation structure that a dotrepresenting "a variable" in the graphical domain hasthe same denotation as a natural language name ordescription introduced from text in a DRS.Furthermore, consider that the situation in Figure 1can be thought of as anaphoric only if we ignore themodality of the graphics, as was done above, but if thenotion of modality is to be considered at all in theanalysis, then the situation in Figure 1 poses the samekind of problems as the one in Figure 2.
In general,graphical objects, functioning as constant erms or asvariables, introduced as antecendents or as pronouns,cannot be expressed in a DRT, as the rulesconstructing these structures (the so-called DRS-construction rules) are triggered by specific syntacticconfigurations of the natural language in which theinformation is expressed.An alternative view on this kind of problemsconsists in looking at them in terms of the traditionallinguistic notion of deixis (Lyons, 1968).
This notionhas to do with the orientational features of languagewhich are relative to the spatio-temporal situation of anutterance.
In this regard, and in connexion with thenotion of graphical anaphor discussed abovel it ispossible to mention the deictic category ofdemonstrative pronouns: words like this and thatwhich permit us to make reference to extralinguisticobjects with the help of pointing acts.
Ambiguity ofthis kind of words is not unusual, as they function notonly as deictic or demonstrative pronouns but also asanaphoric, if they are preceeded by a linguistic context,and even as determiners with a deictic component as inexpressions like this car.Consider, for instance, that the text in Figure 1could be substituted by the expression this washed thiswhere the first this is supported by pointing to the manand the second by pointing to the car.
So, in this line ofdiscussion, it is possible to think of the pronoun it inFigure 1 as a deictic pronuon which refers to the world,although in an indirect manner through a symbol of adifferent modality.
More generally and according toKamp (Kamp, 1981):...deictic and anaphoric pronouns selecttheir referents from certain sets ofantecedently available entities.
The twopronouns uses differ with regard to theA Model for Multimodal Reference Resolution 101nature of these sets.
In the case of a deicticpronoun the set contains entities that belongto the real world, whereas the selection setfor an anaphoric pronoun is made up ofconstituents of the representation that hasbeen constructed in response to antecentdiscourse.For the purpose of this discussion, it is interestingto question what the nature of the sets mentioned abovecan be.
In normal deictic situations the use of ademonstrative pronoun is accompanied by a pointingact to an object that can be perceived irectly throughthe visual modality, and as a result of such a visualinterpretation process, the object is representedinternally by the subject, however, not necessarilythrough a linguistic representation, but in arepresentation of a different modality.
According tothis, the notion of modality is a representationalnotion, and not a sensory notion, as it is normallyconsidered in psychological discussion.
In the formersense, a representation is a set of expressions of aformal anguage; that is to say, with a lexicon and withwell-defined syntactic and semantic structures.
Theinterpretation conventions of an expression of a givenmodality are determined by the interpreter of thelanguage.
Reasoning with information expressed inboth of the modalities is achieved with the help of atranslation relation that is similar to the relation oftranslation between atural languages.This view of multimodal representation andreasoning can be formalized in terms of Montague'sgeneral semiotic programme (Dowty, 1985).
Eachmodality in the system can be captured through aparticular language, and relations between expressionsof different modalities can be modeled in terms oftranslation functions from basic and compositeexpressions of the source modality into expressions ofthe object modality.
In a system of this kind,interpreting examples in Figures 1 and 2 in relation tothe linguistic modality consists in interpreting theinformation expressed through natural languagedirectly when enough information is available, andcompleting the interpretation process by means oftranslating expressions of other modalities into thelinguistic one.
Consider Figure 3 --following (Pineda,1989, 1996) and (Santana et al, 1997)--- in which amultimodal representational system for linguistic andgraphical modalties i  illustrated.The circles labeled G and L in Figure 3 representthe sets of expressions of the graphical and naturallanguages respectively; the functions p~ and PG standfor the translation mappings between the twolanguages.
The circle labeled with P represents he setFLFigure 3of graphical symbols consituting the graphicalmodality proper (i.e the actual symbols on a piece ofpaper or on the screen).
Note that two sets ofexpressions are considered for the graphical modality:the expressions in G belong to the formal language inwhich graphics are represented and reasoned about,and are thought of as the "form" of the overt graphicalsymbols whose "substance" (in the Saussurean sense)contained in P cannot be manipulated directly.
The setW stands for the world and together with the functionsFp, FG, FL constitutes a multimodal system ofinterpretation.
The order pair <W, Ft.> defines themodel ML for the natural anguage, and the order pair<W, FG o Fp> defines the model MG for the graphicallanguage.In order to illustrate how this multimodal system ofinterpretation works consider, for instance, that thedenotations of the picture of a man and the word he inFigure 1 is the same individual in the world; in thesame way, the denotations of the word Saarbriickenand the dot on the intersection between the straightline and the lower segment of curve representing theborder between France and Germany in Figure 2 arealso the same, which is the city of Saarbriicken itself.So, if one asks who is he?
looking at Figure 1, theanswer is found by computing pL(he) whose value isthe picture of the man on the figure.
Once thiscomputation is performed the picture can behighlighted or signaled by other graphical means.
Ifone points out the middle dot in Figure 2 at the timethe question what is this?
is asked, on the other hand,the answer is found by applying the function Pc to thepointed dot, whose value would be the wordSaarbriicken.It should be clear that if all theoretical elementsillustrated in Figure 3 are given, questions about102 L .A .
P ineda  and G. Garzamultimodal scenarios can be answered through theinterpretation process; that is to say, evaluatingexpressions of a given modality in terms of theinterpreters of the languages involved and thetranslation functions.However, when one is instructed to interpret amultimodal message, like Figures 1 and 2, not allinformation in the scheme of Figure 3 is available.
Inparticular, the translation functions PL and PG are notknown, and the crucial inference of the interpretationprocess has as its goal to induce these functions.
Suchan inference can be thought of as the same process thatthe one involved in solving the so-called linguisticanaphor with pictorial antecedent and the pictorialanaphor with linguistic antecedent.
It would also beequivalent o finding out deictic references if "thevisual world" is thought of as represented throughexpressions of the graphical representation modality.These are three different ways of looking at the sameproblem.It is important to highlight hat in order to inducePL and PG the information overtly provided in themultimodal message is usually not enough.
As will bediscussed below in this paper, such a process will alsorequire to consider the grammatical structrure of thelanguages involved, the definition of translations rulesbetween languages, and conceptual knowledge storedin memory about he interpretation domain.Another consequence of the scheme in Figure 3 isthat it provides the basis for generating referringexpressions of a given modality in terms of informationprovided in other modalities.
Consider that basicconstants or composite xpressions of the languages Gand L can be translated to basic or compositeexpressions of the other language, depending on thedefinition of the translation function.
So, if ones needsto refer linguistically to a graphical configuration, forinstance, it would only be required to find anexpression of G which expresses all graphicalattributes of the desired object in the most simplefashion, and then translate it to its correspondingexpression in L. The resulting natural languageexpression could be used directly or embbeded in alarger natural anguage xpressions containing wordsthat refer to abstract objects or properties.
To illustratethis point consider the natural language textSaarbriiken lies at the intersection between the borderbetween France and Germany and a line from Paris toFrankfurt.
This sentence contains the definitedescription the intersection between the borderbetween France and Germany and a line from Paris toFrankfurt, which in turns contains a number ofsimplier (basic and composite) referring expressions.Finding the graphical referent of these expressionsrequires the identification of dots, lines and curves(and parts of curves) in the map that have the samereferent.
However, the map in Figure 2 has graphicalentities that have an interpretation but are not namedin the text (consider Figure 4 in which the graphicalentities of Figure 2 have been labeled).
For instance,Belgium is represented by region r4, and the curve r6represents the border between France and Belgium.Once the picture has been interpreted one would beentitle to ask not only for graphical objects that havebeen named, but also for any meaningful graphicalobject.
So, if one points to the curve c6 in Figure 2, oneanswer provided could be The border between Franceand Belgium.
As some graphical objects named byconstants of the graphical language do not have aproper natural anguage name, the translation functionPo must associate a basic constant of G with acomposite description of L. The process of inducingsuch a translation function produces the correspondingreferring expressions too.tr4 !c3.

"~.clFigure 4In the rest of this paper, some preliminar esults ofhow this programme can be carried out are presented.In Section 2, a formalization of the languages L and Gwith their corresponding translation functions andsemantic interpretation, along the lines of Montague'sgeneral semiotic programme, is presented.
In thissection the process of multimodal interpretation andreasoning is explained, and the translation ofexpressions of one modality in terms of the other isillustrated.
However, such a process can be carried outonly if the translation functions are known and, as wasmentioned above, that is not normally the case.
InSection 3, some initial results on how such functionscan be induced in terms of the multimodal message,constraints on the interpretation conventions of themodalities, and constraints on the general knowledgeabout the domain, are presented.
In this section theprocess of generating graphical and linguistic referringA Model for  Mult imodal Reference Resolut ion 103expressions, which is associated with the induction ofthe translation functions, is also illustrated.
In Section4 a preliminar discussion on the feasibility ofextending Kamp's DRS with multimodal structures ipresented.
Finally, in the conclusion a tentativereflexion on the relation of anaphora nd spacial deixison the light of such a kind of theory is advanced.2 A Multimodal Interpretation SystemIn this section the definition of the syntax andsemantics of the languages L and G to express themultimodal message of Figure 2 is presented.
Thelanguage L is designed to produce xpressions usefulto refer to objects, properties and relations commonlyfound in discourse about maps.
In particular, thenatural language expressions of Figure 2 can beconstructed in a compositional fashion within L.Thelanguage G, on the other hand, is expressive enough torefer to geometrical objects, properties and relationsfound in drawings.
The definitions of L and G followclosely the general guidelines of Montague's emioticprogramme.
As a first step of the syntactic definitionthe set of categories or types is stated.
For each type ofa language a corresponding type in the other languageis defined.
Basic constants of the source language canbe mapped either to basic or composite xpressions ofthe corresponding type in the object language; in asimilar fashion a composite xpression of the sourcelanguage can be mapped into a basic or compositeexpression of the object language.
A number of basicconstants for each of these types is defined and thecombination rules for producing composite xpressionsare stated.
Associated to each syntactic rule atranslation rule mapping the expression formed by therule to its translation to the other language is defined.In the same way that the interpretation of the naturallanguage xpressions in the PTQ system (Dowry, 1985)is given indirectly through the translation tointensional logic, which has a model-theoreticsemantic interpretation, the interpretation ofexpressions of L is given indirectly through itstranslation to expressions of G, as shown in Figure 3.The interpretation of expressions of G, in turn, isexplicitly given through the model Me.
Theinterpretation function FL states the normal meaningfor English words, and Fp is determined by transitivityonce the translation function between G and L isdefined, and no further formalization for FL and Fp ispresented in this paper.
Another simplifyingassumption rests on the consideration that theinterpretations of all expressions included in theselanguages depend only on the current graphical stateand no intensional types are included in the definitionof L and G. However, this analysis can be extended onthe lines of intensional logic if to deal with a morecomprehensive fragment of English is required.
InSection 2.1 the definition of L is presented and inSection 2.2 the language G and its interpretationfunction are formally defined.2.1 Definition of the Language LThe language L is designed to produce xpressions likeSaarbriicken lies at the intersection between theborder between France and Germany and a line fromParis to Frankfurt in a compositional fashion.Thismeans that all basic constants like France andGermany, and also all subexpressions of the formersentence, like the border between France and Germanyor a line from Paris to Frankfurt can also be produced.In addition, language L can produce expressions likeFrance is a country, Frankfurt is a city of Germany orGermany is to the east of France which expresscommon sense knowledge required in theinterpretation of maps.
Next, the definition of L ispresented.The set of syntactic ategories of L is as follows:1.
The basic syntactic ategories of L are t, IV andCN, where t is the category of sentences, IV is thecategory of intransitive verbs and CN is the category ofcommon ouns.2 If A and B are syntactic ategories then A/B is acategory.Traditional syntactic ategories of natural anguagelike transitive verbs (TV), terms (TL propositionalphrases (PP) and determiners (T/CN) can be derivedfrom the basic categories.For each syntactic category of L there is acorresponding type in G. The correspondence b tweenlinguistic categories and geometrical types resemblesthe translation from English to Intensional Logic(Dowty, 1985) and it is defined in terms of the functionf as follows:1. f(t) = t.2.
f(CN) = f(IV) = <e, t>.3.
For any categories A and B, f(A/B) = <f(B),f(A)>.The following table illustrates the basic constants ofL with their category names, category definition andthe corresponding type in the graphical language:104 L .A .

Thisgraphical type is interpreted as the set of properties (orpredicates holding in the interpretation state) that anindividual named by the term has.
So, as a city isrepresented through a dot in the graphical domain, thetranslation of Paris, for instance, is the set ofproperties that the dot representing Paris has in theintepretation state.
Common nouns are translated intographical predicates: city translates into the set of dotsrepresenting cities.
Transitive verbs are translated intofunctions taking predicates as their arguments andproducing sets of individuals as their values: the verbphrase be a city, for instance, translates into a set ofdots representing cities.
Determiners, prepositionalphrases and intransitive verbs function in a similarfashion, although there are no basic constant of thelast two categories, as prepositional words areintroduced syncategorematically nd intransitive verbphrases are always composite expressions in thisgrammar.
In Figure 6 the translation for all basicconstants of L into G is presented.
The interpretationof the expressions in the column for G are clarifiedbelow in this paper when G is formally defined.Next, the syntactic rules of L and the translationrules to G are presented.
Each rule is presented in abox containing the purpose of the rule, the syntacticrule itself with examples of expressions that can beformed with the rule, and finally the translationrule of expressions formed by the rule to theircorresponding expressions in G. FollowingMontague, syntactic rules and the syntacticoperations for combining symbols (for instance, Ft)associated to each rule are separated.

The types of language G are definedas follows:(1) e is a type (graphical objects).
(2) t is a type (truth values).
(3) If  a and b are any types, then <a, b> is a type.
(4) Nothing else is a type.Let V~ be the set of variables of type s, C~ the set ofbasic constants of type s, and Es the set of well-formed expressions of graphical type s. The basicconstants are presented in Figure 7.Basic constantdl, d2, d3,rt, r2, r3, r4,Ch C2, C3, C4, C5, C6,dot, region, curve, line,intersection, rightlie_at, in_zoneType<e, t>Corresponding categoryin LnoneCNTV <<<e,  t>, t>, <e, t>> !<e, <e, t>> !nonei = ^, ~ <t, <t, t>> noneinside <<<e, t>, t>, <e, t>> TVcurve_between <<<e, t>, t>, <<<e, t>, t>, <e, t>>> noneintersection_between <<<e,  t>, t>, <<<e, t>, t>, <e, t>>> noneline_from_to <<<e, t>, t>, <<<e, t>, t>, <e, t>>> nonezone <<<e, t>, t>, <<e, t>, e>> noneof" <<<e, t>, t>, <<e, t>, <e, t>>> nonei <<<e, t>, t>, <<<e,  t>, t>, <<e, t>, <e, t>>>> between*, fromto*Figure 7noneThe symbols of', between* and from_to* areabbreviations for the corresponding expressions inG as mentioned above in the definition of rulesT5L, T6L and T7L.In the same way that the translation of basicconstants of L into G where given with the purposeto understand the translation rules T1L tO T7L, inFigure 8 and 9 the reciprocal translations are given.Note that constants of G in Figure 8 translate intobasic constants of L; however, the translation shownin Figure 9 are more complex as compositeexpressions of G can translate into basic or compositeexpressions of L. Consider that expressions 1 to 6 of Gin Figure 9 represent the graphical objects dl, d2, ds,r~, r2 and c~ in Figure 4.
The reason to represent theseobjects with a type-rised is that the language G isdesigned to allow quantification over the graphicalGdotresioncurveLcitycountryborderline lineintersection intersectionright Eastlie_at lie atin_zone be toFigure 8domain.
So, instead of referring directly to the dotrepresenting Paris, the corresponding expressiondenotes the set of geometrical properties that the dotrepresenting Paris has.
According to this, expression 1(of G) in Figure 9 denotes the set containing all sets ofdots of the drawing in which dt is included; thus, if Pis the set of all dots representing cities, dl is includedin P (that is to say, P is a property of dl), but if P is theset of all dots representing cities in Germany then d~ isnot included in P.108 L .A .

Let Dx be the set ofpossible denotations for expressions of type x, suchthat De = A, Dt = { 1, 0}, and, for any types a and b,D<~.b> =DbD~ (i. e., the set of all functions from D~to Db).
Let F be an interpretation function thatassigns to each constant of type a a member of Da.The interpretation (assigned by F) of the constantsdot, region, curve, line, right, intersection are thesets containing the corresponding graphical objects.The interpretation of the constants lie_at, in_zone,inside, curve_between, intersection_between,line_from_to, zone (whose types are shown inFigure 6) are geometrical functions.
If thearguments of these functions have an appropriategeometrical type (dot, region, curve, etc.
)expressions containing these constants can beproperly interpreted through a geometricalalgorithm; however, if some of the arguments arenot of the right kind of geometrical object, thenexpressions containing these constants have nodenotation in G and, as a consequence, theirtranslation into L lack a denotation too.
Theseconditions can be computed with the help of thetype-predicates forgeometrical objects in G.Following Montague, the interpretation ofvariables is defined in terms of an assignmentfunction g. It is also adopted the notationalconvention by which the semantic value ordenotation of an expression tx with respect o amodel M and a value assignment g is expressed as\[\[a\]\] M,~.The semantic rules for interpreting the languageL are the following:1.
I fa~ C~, then \[\[a\]\]M= ~a) .2.
If I.t e V~, then \[\[~\]\]M,g = g(B).3.
If aeE<a,b>, and 13eE,~, then \[\[ct(\[3)\]\] M's =\[\[a\]l~'ff\[\[p\]\]) M's4.

In this system it is possible to expressnatural language and graphics and translateexpresssion between each other as stated in Section1.
It is also possible to interpret multimodalmessages in which part of information is expressedin one modality but some information is carried outin the other modality.
One advantage of the systemis that a natural anguage question can be answeredby considering the graphics; for instance, if oneasks (with a suitable extension to the language)what is the distance between Paris and Frankfurt?the answer could be obtained by translating thequestion into the graphical domain where thedistance sought could be computed in terms of thegeometry (assuming that the map is drawn at agiven scale) and the numerical value could betranslated back into natural language.
In addition, if112 L.A. Pineda and G. Garzareasoning models acting upon representations ofeach of the modalities were stated, problems couldbe solved in the modality requiring the lowerreasoning effort.Another advantage of the system is that itpermits to rule out natural language expressionswhich are well-formed syntactically but are,nevertheless, meaningless.
The expression a city ofFrance is well-formed and has a well-definedreference; however, the expression a city of  Paris,with the same syntactic form, is not well-definedsemantically.
This last expression can be rule out asungrammatical s its translation into the graphicallanguage does not have an interpretation i  terms ofthe geometry.
If a condition to the effect that aexpression of L is grammatical only if itstranslation into G has a well-defined enotation,the graphical domain imposes a kind of selectionalrestriction which simplifies greatly the syntacticdefinition of L.At this point, one warning note is in order: thegraphical anguage is probably too expressive andmore complex than required.
However, havingexplicit quantification i the graphical domain canpose some interesting questions.
Traditionallygraphics is considered appropriate for representingconcrete situations and natural anguage is better toexpress abstractions.
However, this is notnecessarily the case: consider the example of Figure1 in which the drawings of a man, a car and abucket were taken to represent concrete individuals.This is so because the man and the car were takento be the antecedents of the anaphoric pronouns heand it.
In a suitable graphical language of the kinddeveloped here a definite reference to suchgraphical objects can be made as follows:~,PXQ3y\[Vx\[P(x) ~ x=y\] A Q(y)\] (~ ).However, some pressupositions are involved inthis interpretation choice as the graphical symbolscould also be taken to be representing anyindividual or even the set of all individuals of thekind.
In the language G all of these readings of thedrawings can be expressed as shown in Figure 10.The multimodal interpretation system developedhere does not solve the question of whichinterpretation should be preferred to, and thisquestion can only be resolved most probably at apragmatic level; however, the distinction can bemade and it should be taken into consideration i ageneral theory of graphical interpretation.
Consider,for instance, whether the drawing of a car on a roadsign preventing cars from parking should beinterpreted as a particular car, any car or all cars.Possible Graphical expressionReadingthe man kPXQ3y\[Vx\[P(x) ~ x=y\] A Q(y)\] ( ~ )a man XP~Q3x\[P(x) A Q(x)\] ( ~ )every man XPLQVx\[P(x) --> Q(x)\] (~)Figure 10The theory also suggests an intriguing path ofexploration related to interactive issues.
In the sameway that natural anguage xpressions can be inputdirectly through the interface, concrete graphicalsymbols are normally placed on the screen bygraphical input devices.
The question is, however,whether it is possible and useful to inputexpressions of G, like the ones in Figure 10,directly.
At the moment his issue is left for furtherresearch.One last consideration is that the system ofmultimodal interpretation presented here provides asound representational scheme to refer in anuniform way to symbols on the screen and to theobjects in the world that they represent.
Inparticular, the ambiguity of natural languageexpressions making interwoven reference to objectson the screen and their interpretation can be placedin a clear representational setting.3 Incremental InterpretationIn the theory developed in Section 2 it was assumedthat the translation of the basic constants of allcategories from L to G and vice versa were known,and then multimodal interpretation and reasoningwere possible; however, in the interpretation ofmultimodal messages, natural language andgraphics are input from different sources, andworking out the meaning of a multimodal messageis by no means trivial.
As was discussed in Section1, solving the graphical anaphora, finding out thereference of deictic pronouns and inducing thetranslation function are related problems that needto be solved for the interpretation of multimodalmessages.
Consider, for instance, the situation ofreading a book with words and pictures: when theassociations between text and graphical symbols isrealized by the reader, the message as a whole hasbeen properly understood.
However, it cannot beA Model for Multimodal Reference Resolution 113expected that such an association can be knownbeforehand.Inducing this translation function is similar tothe computer vision problem of interpretingdrawings.
A related antecedent is the work on thelogic of depiction (Reiter et al, 1987) in which alogic for the interpretation f maps to be applied incomputer vision and intelligent graphics isdeveloped.
It is argued that any adequaterepresentation scheme for visual (and computergraphics) knowledge must mantain the distinctionbetween knowledge of the image (the graphics) andknowledge of the scene (its interpretation), andabout the depiction relation.
In Reiter's system twosets of first order logical sentences representing thescene and the image are employed, and express,respectively, the conceptual and geometricalknowledge about hand drawn sketch maps ofgeographical regions.
The depiction relationcorresponds to the translation function betweenconstants of L and G discussed above.
Aninterpretation i Reiter's system is defined as amodel, in the logical sense, of both sets of sentencesand the depiction relation, and interpreting adrawing consists in finding out all possible modelsof such sets of sentences.Although computing the set of models of a set offirst order sentences i computationally untractableproblem, the entities constituting a drawingconform, normally, a finite set which is often small.So, the possibility of computing the set of models ofa drawings is a matter for empirical research.
Inparticular, Reiter's system employs a constraintsatistaction algorithm to find out all possibleinterpretation fmaps, and the output of his systemis a set of labels for curves or chains as rivers, roadsor shores, and for areas as land regions or waterregions.
As was mentioned above, to find thetranslation functions between G and I., is a similarproblem with the same kind of complexity.As a side effect of working out the translationbetween basic graphical and linguistic constants, amethod for generating natural anguage xpressionsthat refer to graphical objects and configurations iat hand.
Consider that a natural languagedescription can have both simple and compositereferring expression that translate into basicgraphical constants, and inducing the linguistictranslation of a graphical term which has not beennamed is the same as generating a linguisticdescription for such an object.
Next, an algorithmfor constructing the translations i illustrated.As a preliminar consideration it is important tohighlight hat such translations cannot be built withthe overt information expressed through themultimodal message.
For working out theinterpretation of Figure 2, for instance, it isrequired, in addition to the text and graphics,knowledge about the geography of Europe and alsoknowledge about interpretation conventions ofmaps.
To find out the translation such knowledgemust be employed.The conventions about the interpretation ofmaps are expressed as a correspondence b tweengraphical and conceptual types, for instance, thatdots represent cities and regions representcountries.
General knowledge about maps, eithergeometrical or conceptual, will constraint thepossible translation.The algorithm for computing the translationfunction has two parts; the purpose of the first is toassign a graphical constant to all terms in the overttextual message according to the grammar of L, andthe second is to assign a referring expression to theremaining raphical constants of the drawing.
Forthe example in Figure 2, the output of the first partis shown in Figure 11.Par~L GdtSaarbriickenFrankfurtFrance,hrlGermany r2the border between France and Germany c ta line from Paris to Frankfurt 11the intersection between the border d2between France and Germany and a linefrom Paris to FrankfurtFigure 11The second part would assign a description tothe remaining graphical constants as shown inFigure 12.G Lr s a countryr4 a countryc2 a borderc: a borderc4 a borderc 5 a borderc6 a borderFigure 12114 L.A. Pineda and G. GarzaFor the definition of the algorithm a functiontable for representing the set of possible functionsfrom graphical to linguistic constants of thecorresponding semantic types is defined.
Theinterpretation conventions for maps are statedthrough the order pairs in the following set: 1 ={<dot, city>, <region, country>, <curve, border>,<line, line>}.
The function table for the first pair inrelation to Figure 2 and 4 is shown in Figure 13.SaarbrtickenFrankfurtParisdl d2 d3Figure 13As can be seen the function table in Figure 13relates all dots to all cities in the text.
As any dotcan represent any city, but different cities arerepresented by different dots, each dot must beassociated to one city by filling the box in which thedot intersects the corresponding city in the functiontable.
Considering that once a dot has been assignedto a city, the row corresponding to that city cannotbe filled out for the other dots.
According to this, ifthere are n cities, the first dot receiving aninterpretation can be assigned in n different ways (itcan represents one of the n cities), the second in n-1different ways, etc.
As a consequence, each functionmap represents n!
possible interpretation functions(if all cities are represented).The first step in the algorithm is to identify allgraphical and linguistic basic constants from theovert message and draw the function tables for theinterpretation conventions et L In our examplebasic linguisctic constants referring to graphicalobjects (proper names) name cities and countries,and only a function table for region representingcountries (in addition to Figure 13) is considered asshown in Figure 14.GermanyFrancerl r2 r3Figure 14r4The next step is to fill out tables in Figures 13and 14 with all possible interpretations that areconsistent with the overt knowledge and also thebackground knowledge about the interpretationtask, in this case knowledge about he geography ofEurope.
The general knowledge to be considered forthis example is shown in Figure 15.
Note thatclauses 1 to 6 are general knowlege of geography,but clause 7 is introduced explicitly in themultimodal message.
Note as well that there mightbe a considerable amount of knowledge about thegeography of Europe which is not included inFigure 15.
However, how knowledge is broughtabout to the interpretation process is beyond thescope of this paper.
The only consideration is thatthe range values of the function tables are the mainindices that somehow retrieve the information frommemory.1.
France is a country2.
Germany is a country3.
Paris is a city of France4.
Frankfurt is a city of Germany5.
i Saarbrticken is a city of Germany6.
i Germany is to the east of France7.
:Saarbrticken lies at the intersectionbetween the border between France andGermany and a line from Paris to FrankfurtFigure 15For filling out the function tables th set of allconstraints hould be considered.
As shown byReiter (Reiter et al, 1987) all possible models canbe found for a finite set of graphical symbols--with a constraint satisfaction algorithm.
Along thisline, we are exploring strategies to find out the setof models incrementally extending the functiontables filling out one column of one table at a timeby considering one constraint at a time.
This isdone in a way that the extended model satisfies allconstraints considered so far.
The process continuesuntil all function tables are filled out.For the example, propositions 3 to 7 areconsidered to produce the function tables illustratedin Figure 16.
Note, in particular, that if proposition7 is not considered a diagonal model for theintepretation f dots would also be admissible.GermanyFrancerl r2 r3 r4Saarbrficken xFrankfurtParis j xdl dEFigure 16xd3A Model for  Mult imodal Reference Resolution 115The next step of the algorithm consists inidentifying the translations of composite referringexpressions to complete table in Figure 11.
This canbe done with the help of the grammar, thetranslation functions, the semantic interpretation fG and the translations already computed in Figure16.
In fact, once the translation of basic constants iknown the translation of composite terms usingthose constants can be found compositionally interms of the translation rules from L to G and theinterpretation rules of G. Consider, additionally,that the translation for basic constants for othercategories i given beforehand as shown in Figure6.
For instance, the translation of the compositeexpression the border between France andGermany into G is~.P~,Q3y\[Vx\[P(x) ~ x=y\] ^ a(y)\](between" (~P\[P(rl)\]) (kP\[P(r2)\]) (curve))which can be reduced intokQ3y\[Vx\[between" (EP\[P(rj)\]) (~P\[P(rz)\])(curve) (x) ~ x=y\] ^ Q(y)\]to produce the final value which is, due to the typerising of terms, the set of properties that c, has, andfor simplicity we take it to be the constant c~.Next, the second part of the algorithmproducing the translation of the set UNNAMED ofgraphical constants that have no name, as shown inFigure 12, is described.
In order to carry out thisprocess, the first step is to identify the types of allconstants in UNNAMED with the help of the typepredicates of G. For each constant it is required toidentify all geometrical functions producing objectsof the constant type.
So, the same constant may beproduced by a number of ways depending on thegeometrical functions available for producingobjects of the constant type.
The next step consistsin identifying all combinations of expressions thatcan be used as arguments of geometrical functions,forming in this way a set of expressions that canproduce the constant at hand.
Each of theseexpressions i  interpreted.
From this process twokinds of outputs can be expected: either theexpression has a well-defined value or it does not.Expressions having a proper value must becombined with a graphical quantifier, and probablywith other expressions of G (to produce thebetween* term from the geometrical functioncurve_between).
The resulting term can betranslated back into the natural language, producingin this way the corresponding description.Suppose it is desired to find a referringexpression of the constant ct of graphical typecurve.
Considering all geometrical functionsdenoted by the basic constants of G, only curve andcurve_between can produce curves.
The constantcurve denotes the set of curves on the drawing, sothe expressions ~,P~Q3x\[P(x) ^ Q(x)\](curve) --aborder-- and 2~P~Q3y\[Vx\[P(x) ~ x=y\] ^Q(y)\](curve) --the border-- can be formed; theinterpretation f the former expression results in theset of properties that one curve or another has,including the properties of curve ct; however, theintepretation of the last expression results in anempty set as there is more than one curve in thedrawing.
So, only the former expression generatedby the constant curve is a possible description of ct.If the constant curve_between is considered, theexpressions hown in Figure 16 can be obtained(the expressions denoting empty sets --asbetween*(kP\[P(rl)\]) kP\[P(ri)\]) curve)---- whereomitted).
As can be seen, only the first of theseexpressions refers to the curve denoted by c,.Expression of G Interpretation(set ofproperties of)between'(LP\[P(rD\]) (kP\[P(rD\]) (curve) clbetween'(kP\[P(rD\]) (kP\[P(rD\]) (curve) c4between'(LP\[P(rD\]) (kP\[P(r4)\]) (curve) cabetween*(kP\[P(r~)D (kP\[P(rD\]) (curve) c2between" (~P\[P(rz)\]) (LP\[P(r4)\]) (curve)between* (~,P\[P(r3) \] (kP\[P(r4)\]) (curve)c~C5Figure 16Thus, the expressions a border, a borderbetween France and Germany and the borderbetween France and Germany are possibledescriptions for cl.
The pragmatic hoice of whichexpression is the most appropriate in aninterpretation context goes beyond the scope of thispaper; here we are only concerned with thecomputation of the set of expressions that can becorrectly produced in terms of the multimodalrepresentation.This procedure has one additional complicationthat has to be taken into account.
Once a graphicalobject has been produced by the procedurementioned above it can also extend the set of theargument combinations of the graphical functionsreferring to other well-formed graphical objects.Note that it is possible to produce very largeexpressions and even infinite ones with theunconstrained recursive application of theprocedure.
It could be possible to produce, forinstance, the border between France and Germany116 L.A. Pineda and G. Garzabetween France and Germany between France andGermany.
This expression is well-formed anddenotes the border between France and Germany.
Inorder to prevent these kind of very large expressionsan algorithm for generating the set of simplest butmaximally expressive xpressions of a graphicallanguage has been proposed (Santana, 1995).4 Multimodal Discourse RepresentationTheoryThe ability to interpret individual multimodalmessages is a prerrequisite for interpretingsequences of multimodal messages occuring in thenormal flow of interactive conversations.
In thesame sense that discourse theories, like DRT, aredesigned to interpret sequences of sentences, it isdesirable to have a theory in which sequences ofmultimodal messages can be understood.
Such akind of theory would have to support anaphoric anddeictic resolution models in an integrated fashion,and would have to be placed in a larger pragmaticsetting in which intentions and presupositions areconsidered, and in which mechanisms to retrieveknowledge from memory are also taken intoaccount.
To work out such a theory is quite anambitious goal, however, in the same way that DRTfocuses in internal structural processes that governanaphoric resolution, it is plausible to consider amultimodal discourse representation theory(MDRT) to cope with referential aspects ofmultimodal communication.
In the same way thatDRT postulates discourse representation structuresin which referents and conditions are introducedincrementally through the interpretation of theincoming natural language discourse through theapplication of construction rules, it is plausible toconceive similar multimodal discourserepresentation structures (MDRS) whose referentsand conditions would be introduced by modalitydepending construction rules acting upon theexpressions of the corresponding modality.
Thedefinition of such an extention of DRT is a long-term goal of this work.A consequence of the notion of modality thathas been developed so far is that expressionsreferring to graphical objects and relations are well-defined in a suitable language, and could beincluded as referents and conditions in the proposedMDRS.
In these structures, DRS-conditionsextracted from different modalities would be kept inseparate partitions, but the discourse referentswould be abstract objects common to the wholeMDRS.
The formalization of modalities in terms ofrepresentation languages would permit to extendDRT, allowing to handle different modalities, aslong as the conditions and referents were introducedby construction rules that triggered by specificsyntactic configurations of the representationlanguage of the modality in question.In summary, the definition of this kind ofstructures would be possible if the following threequestions could be answered: how information ofdifferent modalities can be incorporated into aMDRS, how discourse referents common toexpressions ofdifferent modalities can be identified,and lastly, how simplification of conditionsinvolving different modalities can be carried out.The suggestion is that these three problems can besolved in terms of the scheme shown in Figure 3and Section 2, and the interpretation processillustrated in Section 3.
For the moment these issuesare left for further work.5 ConclusionsIn this paper a theory of representation andinterpretation for multimodal messages, and amodel for multimodal reference resolution has beenpresented.
First, it was discussed how this problemcan be stated in terms of so-called linguisticanaphor with pictorial antecedents, or pictorialanaphor with linguistic antecedents.
It was arguedthat in more traditional lines such a problem can bethought of, alternativelly, as the resolution ofspacial indexical referents.
It was also argued thatwith a representational theory of modality, one inwhich the notion of modality is captured in terms ofa formal language and its interpreter, a thirdinterpretation of the problem of multimodalreference resolution can be given.
In this last view,solving multimodal references can be thought of asinducing a translation function between basicconstants of the modalities involved.
Therepresentation and interpretation machinery forcarrying on this third view was formally developedalong the lines of Montague's emiotic programmeand its associated general theory of translation.
Itwas also illustrated an algorithm for finding outsuch a translation relation when text and graphicsare introduced through independent input channels,and the translation between constants must beinduced dynamically.
Finally, it was suggested toextend Kamp's DRT with multimodal discoursestructures (MDRS) in order to model the referentialaspects of the kind of multimodal discourse that islikely to occur in interactive multimodalA Model for Multimodal Reference Resolution 117conversation.
This extension would permit tocapture an aspect of spacial deixis which iscurrently beyond the scope of DRT.
If the notion ofmultimodal discourse representation structures isdeveloped along the lines suggested in this paper,Kamp's demarcation between anaphoric and deicticuses of pronouns could be formally captured, as thesets of antecedents taken from the world would beincorparted as referents and conditions of a MDRS:while the antecedents for anaphoric pronouns takenfrom preceeding text are accesible for pronouns,deictic antecedents would be accesible viatranslation functions.ReferencesElisabeth Andr6, Thomas Rist.
