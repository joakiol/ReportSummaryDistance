A CONSIDERATION ON THE CONCEPTS STRUCTURE AND LANGUAGEIN RELATION TO SELECTIONS OF TRANSLATION EQUIVALENTS OF VERBS IN MACHINE TRANSLATION SYSTEMSSho YoshidaDepartment of Electronics, Kyushu University 36,Fukuoka 812, JapanABSTRACTTo give appropriate translation equivalentsfor target words is one of the most fundamentalproblems in machine translation systrms.Especially, when the MT systems handle languagesthat have completely different structures likeJapanese and European languages as source andtarget languages.
In this report, we discussabout the data strucutre that enables appropriateselections of translation equivalents for verbsin the target language.
This structure is basedon the concepts strucutre with associated infor-mation relating source and target languages.Discussion have been made from the standpoint ofrealizability of the structure (e.g.
from thestandpoint of easiness of data collection andarrangement, easiness of realization and compact-ness of the size of storage space).i.
Selection of Translation EquivalentSelection of translation equivalent of averb becomes necessary when,(1) the verb has multiple meanings, or(2) the meaning of the verb is modified underdifferent contexts (though it cannot bethought as multiple meanigns).For example, those words ' ?~ ', '~9~;~ ','~< ', '~ ' ,  ' r ~  ', '@~< ', ...are selectively used as translation equivalents ofan English verb 'play' according as its context.i.
play tennis : ~--- ~r~2.
play in the ground : ~ ~ ~ ~"C~3.
The children were playing ball (with eachother) : -~ /~, ' - -~r I~ 'g~t~.
play piano : ~ 'T~r~(5.
Lightning palyed across the sky as the stormbegan : ~ : ~  ~ f ~ hIn the above examples, they are not essential-ly due to multiple meanigns of 'play' but need toassign different translation euqivalents accordingas the differences of contexts in the case of 1.to 3., and due to multiple meanings in the cases of4.
o rS .A typical idea for selecting translationeuqivalents so far is shown in the followingexample.Lets take a verb 'play'.
If the objectwords of the verb belong to a category C play: ~ ~ objwe give a verb ' ?~ '(=do) as its appropriatetranslation equivalent.
If the object wordsbelong to a category C I~ : ~< , we give '~< 'as an appropriate translation equivalent of'play'.Thus, we categories words (in the targetlanguage) that are agent, object, -."
of a givenverb (in the source language) according asdifferences of its appropriate translationequivalents.In other words, these words are categorizedaccording as "such expression as a verb with itscase filled with these words be afforded in thetarget language or not", and are by no meanscategorized by their concepts (meaning) alone.For example, for tennis, baseball, ... ECPobl~: S~ =(tennis, baseball, card, ...}, trans-lation of 'play' are given as follows.play tennis : T - -x~cl tplay baseball : ~ c i ~play card : ~-- F~c?
"To the words belonging to C play: 9~ ( =obJ{piano, violine, harp, -.. ), the translationequivalent of 'play' is given as follows.play piano : ~ 'T J  ~z~<play violine : ~4  ~ i) ~r~pla~ harp : ~" -- / ~r ~ <Categories given in this way have a problemthat not a small part of them do not coincidewith natural categories of concepts.
For example,members ' 7 ~ (ten/lid) ' and ' ~(baseba l l )  ' of acategory belong to a natural categoryof concepts ~(ba l l  game), but ' ~- -Y(card) 'does'nt.
Instead it belorEs to a conceptualcategory ~ (game in general).
~ is consideredas a sub-category of ~ .
Therefore, if weregard C play: ~ ~ obJ as ~ , then ~---~ (tennis),~-- ~" (card), 7 ~ ~ ~'--~ (football), ~7  (golf),--- can be members of it, but ~(go) ,  ~;~(shogi)which also belong to the conceptual category ~,are not appropriate as members of ~obl~ : $ ~('pl%y go : ~r~' ,  'play shogi : ~}~%~&'  arenot appropriate, instead we say 'pla~ go : ~r_~u_~ ', 'play shogi : ~_~._~' )Therefore, cPla.
y: $~ should be deridedOD~ play" ~ & _~lay.
~into two categories Cob j " and tobJ " @The problem here is that, such division ofcategories do not necessarily coincide withnatural division of conceptual categories.
For167example, translation equivalent '~ ' '  cannot beassigned to a verb 'play' when object word of itis ~ ~ ~ (chess), which is a game similar to ~ or~ .
Moreover, if the verb differs from 'play',then the corresponding structure of categories ofnouns also differs from that of play.
Thus wehave to prepare different structure of categoriesfor each verb.This is by no means preferable from bothconsiderations of space size and realizability onactual data, because we have to check all thecombinations of several ten thousands nouns witheach verb.2.
Concepts Structure with.
Associated InformationSo we turn our standpoint and take naturalcategories of nouns (concepts) as a base andassociate to it through case relation pairs of averb and its translation equivalent.Let a structure of natural categories ofnouns were given (independently of verbs).A part of the categories (concepts) structureand associated information (such as a verb andits translation equivalent pair through caserelation etc.)
is given in Fig.1.In Fig.l, verbs associated are limited to afew ones such as Do (obJ = musical ins t rument )~Pla~ (obJ = musical instrument).
Becsuse, fromthe definition of musical instrument :'an objectwhich is played to give musical sound (such as apiano, a horn, etc.
)", we can easily recall averb 'play' as the most closely related verb inthis ease.It can generally be said that the more thenoun's relation to human becomes closer and themore the level of abstract of the noun becomeslower the numbers of verbs that are closely relatedto them ~id therefore have to associate to them(nouns) become large.
And that the numbers ofassociated ideoms or ideom like parases becomelarge, Therefore, the division of categoriesmust further be done.The process of constructing this datastructure is as follows.
(1) Find a pair of verb and associated transla-tion equivalent (Do ,  Play : ~9-& ) that canbe associated in common to a part of thestructure of the categories as in Fig.l, andthen find appropriate translation equivalents indetail at the lower level categories.
(2) To each verb found in the process of theassociation, consults ordinary dictionary oftranslation equivalents and word usage of verbsand obtain the set of all the translationeuqivalents for the verb.
(3) Then find nouns (categories) related throughcase relation to each translation equivalentverb thus obtained by consulting word usagedictionary.
Then check all the nouns belongingto nearby categories in the given conceptsstructure and find a nouns group to which weassociate the translation equivalent.In this manner, we can find pairs of verb andits translation equivalent for any noun belongingto a given category.
To summarize the advantageof the ls~ter method, (1) to (4) follows.
(i) The only one natural conceptural categoriesstructure should be given as the basis of thisdata structure.
This categories structure isstable, and will  not be changed basically, andis constructed independently from verbs.
Inother words, it is constructed indepndentlyfrom target language expression.
(2) To each noun in a given conceptual category,,numbers of associated pairs of verb and itstranslation equivalent are generally small andcan easily be found.
(3) Association of the pair of verb and its trans-lation equivalent through case relation shouldbe given to one category for which the associa-tion hold in common for any member of it.
Incplay : ~ <Fig.l, a conceptual category -obJ iscreated from two categories ~ (keyboadmusical instrument) a n d ~  (string musicalinstrument) for this purpose.
And thenassociate through case relation specific pairof verb and its translation equivalent toexceptional nouns in the category.
(4) From (i) to (3), it follows that this datastructure needs considerably less space andis more practical to construct than the formermethod.

Concludin5 RemarksWe proposed a data structure based on con-cepts structure with associated pairs of verb andits translation equivalent through case relationsto enable the appropriate selections of transla-tion equivalents of verbs in MT systems.Additional information that should beassociated to this data structure for the selec-tions of translation equivalents is ideoms orideom like phrases.
The association process issimilar to the association process in chapter 2.0nly the selections of translation equiva-lents for English into Japanese MT have beendiscussed on the ass~nmption that the translationequivalents for nouns were given.Though the selection of translation equiva-lents for nouns are also important, the effectof application domain depeadence is so greatthat we strongly relied on that property at thepresent circumstances.There are cases that translation equivalentsare determined by pairs of verbs and nouns toeach other.
So we need to study the problem ofselection of translation equivalent also fromthis point of view.Reference(i) Sho Yoshida : Conceptual Taxonomy for NaturalLanguage Processing, Computer Science &Technologies, Japan Annual Reviews in Electro-nics, Computers & Telecommunications, CH~HA& North-Hollg_ud, 1982.168/ ~ ~ ( :Keyboard instrument) ~ ~'T/ (:Piano)~~- -~u~ y( : Organ) / ... / C  obj Play:.
