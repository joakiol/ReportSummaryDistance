These include deeply anno-tated data collections of 25 subsaharanlanguages that are described together withtheir annotation scheme, and further, the cor-pus tool ANNIS that provides a unified accessto a broad variety of annotations created with arange of different tools.
With the applicationof ANNIS to several African data collections,we illustrate its suitability for the purpose oflanguage documentation, distributed accessand the creation of data archives.1 Information StructureThe Collaborative Research Centre (CRC)"Information structure: the linguistic means forstructuring utterances, sentences and texts"brings together scientists from different fields oflinguistics and neighbouring disciplines from theUniversity of Potsdam and the Humboldt-University Berlin.
Our research comprises theuse and advancement of corpus technologies forcomplex linguistic annotations, such as theannotation of information structure (IS).
Wedefine IS as the structuring of linguisticinformation in order to optimize informationtransfer within discourse: information needs tobe prepared ("packaged") in different waysdepending on the goals a speaker pursues withindiscourse.Fundamental concepts of IS include theconcepts `topic?, `focus?, `background?
and`information status?.
Broadly speaking, the topicis the entity a specific sentence is construedabout, focus represents the new or newsworthyinformation a sentence conveys, background isthat part of the sentence that is familiar to thehearer, and information status refers to differentdegrees of familiarity of an entity.Languages differ wrt.
the means of realizationof IS, due to language-specific properties (e.g.,lexical tone).
This makes a typologicalcomparison of traditionally less-studiedlanguages to existing theories, mostly onEuropean languages, very promising.
Particularemphasis is laid on the study of focus, itsfunctions and manifestations in differentsubsaharan languages, as well as thedifferentiation between different types of focus,i.e., term focus (focus on arguments/adjuncts),predicate focus (focus on verb/verbphrase/TAM/truth value), and sentence focus(focus on the whole utterance).We describe corpora of 25 subsaharanlanguages created for this purpose, together withANNIS, the technical infrastructure developed tosupport linguists in their work with these datacollections.
ANNIS is specifically designed tosupport corpora with rich and deep annotation, asIS manifests itself on practically all levels oflinguistic description.
It provides user-friendlymeans of querying and visualizations fordifferent kinds of linguistic annotations,including flat, layer-based annotations as usedfor linguistic glosses, but also hierarchicalannotations as used for syntax annotation.2 Research Activities at the CRCWithin the Collaborative Research Centre, thereare several projects eliciting data in largeamounts and great diversity.
These data,originating from different languages, differentmodes (written and spoken language) andspecific research questions characterize thespecification of the linguistic database ANNIS.2.1 Linguistic Data BaseThe project ?Linguistic database for informationstructure: Annotation and Retrieval?, further17database project, coordinates annotationactivities in the CRC, provides service to projectsin the creation and maintenance of datacollections, and conducts theoretical research onmulti-level annotations.
Its primary goals,however, are the development and investigationof techniques to process, to integrate and toexploit deeply annotated corpora with multiplekinds of annotations.
One concrete outcome ofthese efforts is the linguistic data base ANNISdescribed further below.
For the specificfacilities of ANNIS, its application to severalcorpora of African languages and its use as ageneral-purpose tool for the publication,visualization and querying of linguistic data, seeSect.
5.2.2 Gur and Kwa LanguagesGur and Kwa languages, two genetically relatedWest African language groups, are in the focus ofthe project ?Interaction of information structureand grammar in Gur and Kwa languages?,henceforth Gur-Kwa project.
In a first researchstage, the precise means of expression of thepragmatic category focus were explored as wellas their functions in Gur and Kwa languages.
Forthis purpose, a number of data collections forseveral languages were created (Sect.
3.1).Findings obtained with this data led to differentsubquestions which are of special interest from across-linguistic and a theoretical point of view.These concern (i) the analysis of syntacticallymarked focus constructions with features ofnarrative sentences (Schwarz & Fiedler 2007),(ii) the study of verb-centered focus (i.e., focuson verb/TAM/truth value), for which there arespecial means of realization in Gur and Kwa(Schwarz, forthcoming), (iii) the identification ofsystematic focus-topic-overlap, i.e., coincidenceof focus and topic in sentence-initial nominalconstituents (Fiedler, forthcoming).
The project'sfindings on IS are evaluated typologically on 19selected languages.
The questions raised by theproject serve the superordinate goal to expandour knowledge of linguistically relevantinformation structural categories in the less-studied Gur and Kwa languages as well as theinteraction between IS, grammar and languagetype.2.3 Chadic LanguagesThe project ?Information Structure in the ChadicLanguages?, henceforth Chadic project,investigates focus phenomena in Chadiclanguages.
The Chadic languages are a branch ofthe Afro-Asiatic language family mainly spokenin northern Nigeria, Niger, and Chad.
As tonelanguages, the Chadic languages represent aninteresting subject for research into focusbecause here, intonational/tonal marking ?
acommonly used means for marking focus inEuropean languages ?
is in potential conflictwith lexical tone, and so, Chadic languagesresort to alternative means for marking focus.The languages investigated in the Chadicproject include the western Chadic languagesHausa, Tangale, and Guruntum and the centralChadic languages Bura, South Marghi, and Tera.The main research goals of the Chadic projectare a deeper understanding of the followingasymmetries: (i) subject focus is obligatorilymarked, but marking of object focus is optional;(ii) in Tangale and Hausa there are sentences thatare ambiguous between an object-focusinterpretation and a predicate-focusinterpretation, but in intonation languages likeEnglish and German, object focus and predicatefocus are always marked differently from eachother; (iii) in Hausa, Bole, and Guruntum there isonly a tendency to distinguish different types offocus (new-information focus vs. contrastivefocus), but in European languages likeHungarian and Finnish, this differentiation isobligatory.2.4 Focus from a Cross-linguisticPerspectiveThe project "Focus realization, focusinterpretation, and focus use from a cross-linguistic perspective", further focus project,investigates the correspondence between therealization, interpretation and use of with anemphasis on focus in African and south-eastAsian languages.
It is structured into three fieldsof research: (i) the relation between differencesin realization and differences in semanticmeaning or pragmatic function, (ii) realization,interpretation and use of predicate focus, and (iii)association with focus.The relation between differences in realizationand semantic/pragmatic differences (i)particularly pertains the semantic interpretationof focus: For Hungarian and Finnish, adifferentiation between two semantic types offoci corresponding to two different types offocus realization was suggested, and weinvestigate whether the languages studied herehave a similar distinction between two (or more)semantic focus types, whether this may differ18from language to language, and whetherdifferences in focus realization correspond tosemantic or pragmatic differences.The investigation of realization, interpretationand use of predicate focus (ii) involves thequestions why different forms of predicate focusare often realized in the same way, why they areoften not obligatorily marked, and why they areoften marked differently from term focus.Association with focus (iii) means that theinterpretation of the sentence is influenced by thefocusing of a particular constituent, marked by afocus-sensitive expression (e.g., particles like`only?, or quantificational adverbials like`always?
), while usually, focus does not have animpact on the truth value of a sentence.
Theproject investigates which focus-sensitiveexpressions there are in the languages studied,what kinds of constituents they associate with,how this association works, and whether it worksdifferently for focus particles andquantificational adverbials.3 Collections of African Language Dataat the CRC3.1 Gur and Kwa CorporaThe Gur and Kwa corpora currently comprisedata from 19 languages.Due to the scarceness of information availableon IS in the Gur and Kwa languages, data had tobe elicited, most of which was done during fieldresearch, mainly in West Africa, and some inGermany with the help of native speakers of therespective languages.
The typologically diverselanguages in which we elicited data by ourselvesare: Baatonum, Buli, Byali, Dagbani, Ditammari,Gurene, Konkomba, Konni, Nateni, Waama,Yom (Gur languages) and Aja, Akan, Efutu, Ewe,Fon, Foodo, Lelemi, Anii (Kwa languages).The elicitation of the data based mainly on thequestionnaire on information structure,developed by our research group (QUIS, seeSection 4.2).
This ensured that  comparable datafor the typological comparison were obtained.Moreover, language-specific additional tasks andquestionnaires tailored to a more detailedanalysis or language-specific traits weredeveloped.As the coding of IS varies across differenttypes of texts, different text types were includedin the corpus, such as (semi-)spontaneousspeech, translations, mono- and dialogues.
Mostof the languages do not have a long literacytradition, so that the corpus data mainlyrepresents oral communication.In all, the carefully collected heterogeneousdata provide a corpus that gives a comprehensivepicture of IS, and in particular the focus systems,in these languages.3.2 Hausar Baka CorpusIn the Chadic project, data from 6 Chadiclanguages are considered.One of the larger data sets annotated in theChadic project is drawn from Hausar Baka(Randell, Bature & Schuh 1998), a collection ofvideotaped Hausa dialogues recording naturalinteraction in various cultural milieus, involvingover fifty individuals of different age and gender.The annotated data set consists of approximately1500 sentences.The corpus was annotated according to theguidelines for Linguistic Information StructureAnnotation (LISA, see Section 4.2).
The Chadiclanguages show various forms of syntacticdisplacement, and in order to account for this, anadditional annotation level was added:constituents are marked as ex-situ=?+?
ifthey occur displaced from their canonical,unmarked position.An evaluation of the focus type and thedisplacement status reveals tendencies in themorphosyntactic realization of different focustypes, see Sect.
5.2.3.3 Hausa Internet CorpusBesides these data collections that are currentlyavailable in the CRC and in ANNIS, furtherresources are continuously created.
As such, acorpus of written Hausa is created in cooperationwith another NLP project of the CRC.The corpora previously mentioned mostlycomprise elicited sentences from little-documented languages with rather smalllanguage communities.
Hausa, in contrast, isspoken by more than 24 million native speakers,with large amounts of Hausa material (some of itparallel to material in other, more-studiedlanguages) available on the internet.
This makesHausa a promising language for the creation ofresources that enable a quantitative study ofinformation structure.The Hausa internet corpus is designed to coverdifferent kinds of written language, includingnews articles from international radio stations(e.g., http://www.dw-world.de), religious texts,literary prose but also material similar tospontaneous spoken language (e.g., in chat logs).19Parallel sections of the corpus compriseexcerpts from the novel Ruwan Bagaja byAbubakar Imam, Bible and Qur?an sections, andthe Declaration of Human Rights.
As will bedescribed in Section 4.3, these parallel sectionsopen the possibility of semiautomaticmorphosyntactic annotation, providing a uniquesource for the study of information structure inHausa.
Sect.
5.2 gives an example forbootstrapping  ex-situ constituents inANNIS only on the basis of  morphosyntacticannotation.4 Data Elicitation and Annotation4.1 Elicitation with QUISThe questionnaire on information structure(Skopeteas et al, 2006) provides a tool for thecollection of natural linguistic data, both spokenand written, and, secondly, for the elaboration ofgrammars of IS in genetically diverse languages.Focus information, for instance, is typicallyelicited by embedding an utterance in a questioncontext.
To avoid the influence of a mediator(working) language, the main body of QUIS isbuilt on the basis of pictures and short moviesrepresenting a nearly culture- and language-neutral context.
Besides highly controlledexperimental settings, less controlled settingsserve the purpose of eliciting longer, cohesive,natural texts for studying categories such asfocus and topic in a near-natural environment.4.2 Transcription and Manual AnnotationIn the CRC, the annotation scheme LISA hasbeen developed with special respect toapplicability across typologically differentlanguages (Dipper et al, 2007).
It comprisesguidelines for the annotation of phonology,morphology, syntax, semantics and IS.The data mentioned above is, in the case ofspeech, transcribed according to IPAconventions, otherwise written according toorthographic conventions, and annotated withglosses and IS, a translation of each sentence intoEnglish or French, (optionally) additional notes,references to QUIS experiments, and referencesto audio files and metadata.4.3 (Semi-)automatic AnnotationAs to the automization of annotation, we pursuetwo strategies: (i) the training of classifiers onannotated data, and (ii) the projection ofannotations on texts in a source language toparallel texts in a target language.Machine Learning.
ANNIS allows to exportquery matches and all their annotated features tothe table format ARFF which serves as input tothe data mining tool WEKA (Witten & Frank,2005), where instances can be clustered, or usedto train classifiers for any annotation level.Projection.
Based on (paragraph-, sentence-or verse-) aligned sections in the Hausa internetcorpus, we are about to project annotations fromlinguistically annotated English texts to Hausa,in a first step parts of speech and possiblynominal chunks.
On the projected annotation, wewill train a tagger/chunker to annotate theremaining, non-parallel sections of the Hausainternet corpus.
Existing manual annotations(e.g.
of the Hausar Baka corpus) will then serveas a gold standard for evaluation purposes.Concerning projection techniques, we expectto face a number of problems: (i) the questionhow to assign part of speech tags to categoriesexisting only in the target language (e.g., theperson-aspect complex in Hausa that bindstogether information about both the verb (aspect)and its (pronominal subject) argument),  (ii)issues of orthography: the official orthographyHausa (Boko) is systematically underspecifiedwrt.
linguistically relevant distinctions.
Neithervowel length nor different qualities of certainconsonants (r) are represented, and also, there isno marking of tones (see Examples 1 and 2, fullyspecified word forms in brackets).
To distinguishsuch homographs, however, is essential to theappropriate interpretation and linguistic analysisof  utterances.

the Linguistic Database ofInformation Structure Annotation5.1 Conception and ArchitectureANNIS (ANNotation of Information Structure)is a web-based corpus interface built to queryand visualize multilevel corpora.
It allows theuser to formulate queries on arbitrary, possiblynested annotation levels, which may be20conflictingly overlapping or discontinuous.
Thetypes of annotations handled by ANNIS include,among others, flat, layer-based annotations (e.g.,for glossing) and hierarchical trees (e.g., syntax).Source data.
As an architecture designed tofacilitate diverse and integrative research on IS,ANNIS can import formats from a broad varietyof tools from NLP and manual annotation, thelatter including EXMARaLDA (Schmidt, 2004),annotate (Brants and Plaehn, 2000), Synpathy(www.lat-mpi.eu/tools/synpathy/), MMAX2(M?ller and Strube, 2006), RSTTool (O'Donnell,2000), PALinkA (Orasan, 2003), Toolbox(Busemann & Busemann, 2008) etc.
These toolsallow researchers to annotate data for syntax,semantics, morphology, prosody, phonetics,referentiality, lexis and much more, as theirresearch questions require.All annotated data are merged together via ageneral interchange format PAULA (Dipper2005, Dipper & G?tze 2005), a highly expressivestandoff XML format that specifically allowsfurther annotation levels to be added at a latertime without disrupting the structure of existingannotations.
PAULA, then, is the native formatof ANNIS.Backend.
The ANNIS server uses a relationaldatabase that offers many advantages includingfull Unicode support and regular expressionsearches.
Extensive search functionalities aresupported, allowing complex relations betweenindividual word forms and annotations, such asall forms of overlapping, contained or adjacentannotation spans, dominance axes (children,ancestors etc., as well as common parent, left- orright-most child and more), etc.Search.
In the user interface, queries can beformulated using the ANNIS Query Language(AQL).
It is based on the definition of nodes tobe searched for and the relationships betweenthese nodes (see below for some examples).
Agraphical query builder is also included in theweb interface to make access as easy as possible.Visualization.
The web interface, realized as awindow-based AJAX application written in Java,provides visualization facilities for search results.Available visualizations include token-basedannotations, layered annotations, tree-likeannotations (directed acyclic graphs), and adiscourse view of entire texts for, e.g.,coreference annotation.
Multimodal data isrepresented using an embedded media player.Special features.
By allowing queries onmultiple, conflicting annotation levelssimultaneously, the system supports the study ofinterdependencies between a potentially limitlessvariety of annotation levels.At the same time, ANNIS allows us tointegrate and to search through heterogeneousresources by means of a unified interface, apowerful query language and a intuitivegraphical query editor and is thereforeparticularly well-suited for the purpose oflanguage documentation.
In particular, ANNIScan serve as a tool for the publication of datacollections via internet.
A fine-grained usermanagement allows granting privileged usersaccess to specific data collections, to make acorpus available to the public, or to seal (butpreserve) a resource, e.g., until legal issues(copyright) are settled.
This also makespublishing linguistic data collections possiblewithout giving them away.Moreover, ANNIS supports deep links tocorpora and corpus queries.
This means thatqueries and query results referred to in, e.g., ascientific paper, can be reproduced and quotedby means of (complex) links (see followingexample).5.2 Using ANNIS.
An Example QueryAs an illustration for the application of ANNIS tothe data collections presented above, consider aresearch question previously discussed in thestudy of object focus in Hausa.In Hausa, object focus can be realized in twoways: either ex-situ or in-situ (Section 3.2).
Itwas found that these realizations do not differ intheir semantic type (Green & Jaggar 2003,Hartmann & Zimmermann 2007): instead, themarked form signals that the focused constituent(or the whole speech act) is unexpected for thehearer (Zimmermann 2008).
These assumptionsare consistent with findings for other Africanlanguages (Fiedler et al 2006).In order to verify such claims on corpora withmorphosyntactic and syntactic annotation for theexample of Hausa, a corpus query can bedesigned on the basis of the Hausar Baka corpusthat comprises not only annotations forgrammatical functions and information-structuralcategories, but also an annotation of ex-situelements.21So, in (3), we look for ex-situ constituents(variable #1) in declarative sentences in theHausa Bakar corpus, i.e., sentences that are nottranslated as questions (variable #2) such that#1 is included in #2 (#1 _i_ #2).
(3) EX-SITU=?+?
&TRANSLATION=?.*[^?]?
&     #1_i_ #2Considering the first 25 matches for this queryon Hausar Baka, 16 examples reveal to berelevant (excluding interrogative pronouns andelliptical utterances).
All of these are directlypreceded by a period (sentence-initial) or acomma (preceded by ee ?yes?, interjections orexclamations), with one exception, preceded by asentence initial negation marker.Only seven examples are morphologicallymarked by focus particles (nee, cee), focus-sensitive adverbs (kaw?i ?only?)
or quantifiers(koomee ?every?).
In nine cases, a personalpronoun follows the ex-situ constituent, followedby the verb.
Together, these constraints describeall examples retrieved, and as a generalization,we can now postulate a number of patterns thatonly make use of morphosyntactic and syntacticannotation (token tok, morphologicalsegmentation MORPH, parts of speech CLASS,nominal chunks CHUNK) with two examplesgiven below:(4) tok=/[,.!?
]/ &CHUNK=?NC?
& MORPH=/[cn]ee/ &#1 .
#2 & #2 .
#3(5) tok=/[,.!?
]/ &CHUNK=?NC?
& CLASS=/PRON.
*/ &CLASS=/V/ & #1 .
#2 &   #2 .#3 & #3 .
#4In (4), we search for a nominal chunkfollowing a punctuation sign and preceding afocus particle (cee or nee), in (5), we search for anominal chunk preceding a sequence ofpronoun/aspect marker and  verb.One example matching template (5) from theHausar Baka corpus is given in Fig.
1.While AQL can be used in this way to helplinguists understand the grammatical realizationof certain phenomena, and the grammaticalcontext they occur in, patterns like (5) above areprobably not too readable to an interested user.This deficit, however, is compensated by thegraphical query builder that allows users tocreate AQL queries in a more intuitive way, cf.Fig.
2.Of course, these patterns are not exhaustiveand overgenerate.
However, they can be directlyevaluated against the manual ex-situ annotationin the Hausar Baka corpus and further refined.So, the manual annotation of ex-situconstituents in the Hausar Baka corpus providestemplates for the semi-automatic detection of ex-situ constituents in a morphosyntacticallyannotated corpus of Hausa: The patterns generatea set of candidate examples from which a humanannotator can then choose real ex-situconstituents.
Indeed, for a better understandingof ex-situ object focus, a study with a largerdatabase of more natural language would be ofgreat advantage, and this pattern-based approachrepresents a way to create such a database of ex-situ constructions in Hausa.Finally, it would also help find instances ofpredicate focus.
When a V(P) constituent isfocused in Hausa, it is nominalized, and frontedlike a focused nominal constituent (Hartmann &Zimmermann 2007).5.3 Related Corpus ToolsSome annotation tools come with searchfacilities, e.g.
Toolbox (Busemann & Busemann,2008), a system for annotating, managing andFigure 2: ANNIS Query Builder, cf.
example (5).Figure 1: ANNIS partitur view, Hausar Baka corpus.22analyzing language data, mainly geared tolexicographic use, and ELAN (Hellwig et al,2008), an annotation tool for audio and videodata.In contrast, ANNIS is not intended to provideannotation functionality.
The main reason behindthis is that both Toolbox and ELAN are problem-specific annotation tools with limited capabilitiesfor application to different phenomena than theywere designed for.
Toolbox provides an intuitiveannotation environment and search facilities forflat, word-oriented annotations; ELAN, on theother hand, for annotations that stand in atemporal relation to each other.These tools ?
as well as the other annotationtools used within the CRC ?
are tailored to aparticular type of annotation, neither of thembeing capable of sufficiently representing thedata from all other tools.
Annotation on differentlevels, however, is crucial for the investigation ofinformation structural phenomena.
In order to fillin this gap, ANNIS was designed primarily withthe focus on visualization and querying of multi-layer annotations.
In particular, ANNIS allows tointegrate annotations originating from differenttools (e.g., syntax annotation created withSynpathy, coreference annotation created withMMAX2, and flat, time-aligned annotationscreated with ELAN) that nevertheless refer to thesame primary data.
In this respect, ANNIS,together with the data format PAULA and thelibraries created for the work with both, is bestcompared to general annotation frameworks suchas ATLAS, NITE and LAF.Taking the NITE XML Toolkit as arepresentative example for this kind offrameworks, it provides an abstract data model,XML-based formats for data storage andmetadata, a query language, and a library withJAVA routines for data storage and manipulation,querying and visualization.
Additionally, a set ofcommand line tools and simple interfaces forcorpus querying and browsing are provided,which illustrates how the libraries can be used tocreate one's own, project-specific corpusinterfaces and tools.Similarly to ANNIS, NXT supports time-aligned, hierarchical and pointer-basedannotation, conflicting hierarchies and theembedding of multi-modal primary data.
Thedata storage format is based on the bundling ofmultiple XML files similar to the standoffconcept employed in LAF and PAULA.One fundamental difference between NXT andANNIS, however, is to be seen in the primaryclientele it targets: The NITE XML Toolkit isaimed at the developer and allows to build morespecialized displays, interfaces, and analyses asrequired by their respective end users whenworking with highly structured data annotated onmultiple levels.As compared to this, ANNIS is directlytargeted at the end user, that is, a linguist tryingto explore and to work with a particular set ofcorpora.
Therefore, an important aspect of theANNIS implementation is the integration with adata base and convenient means for visualizationand querying.6 ConclusionIn this paper, we described the Africanist projectsof the CRC ?Information Structure?
at theUniversity of Potsdam and the HumboldtUniversity of Berlin/Germany, together withtheir data collections from currently 25subsaharan languages.
Also, we have presentedthe linguistic database ANNIS that can be used topublish, access, query and visualize these datacollections.
As one specific example of our work,we have described the design and ongoingconstruction of a corpus of written Hausa, theHausa internet corpus, sketched the relevant NLPtechniques for (semi)automatic morphosyntacticannotation, and the application of the ANNISQuery Language to filter out ex-situ constituentsand their contexts, which are relevant with regardto our goal, a better understanding of focus andinformation structure in Hausa and other Africanlanguages.ReferencesT.
