This pa-per presents two corpora of blog posts in Eng-lish and in Spanish, annotated according to theEmotiBlog annotation scheme.
Furthermore,we created 20 factual and opinionated ques-tions for each language and also the GoldStandard for their answers in the corpus.
Thepurpose of our work is to study the challengesinvolved in a mixed fact and opinion questionanswering setting by comparing the perform-ance of two Question Answering (QA) sys-tems as far as mixed opinion and factual set-ting is concerned.
The first one is open do-main, while the second one is opinion-oriented.
We evaluate separately the two sys-tems in both languages and propose possiblesolutions to improve QA systems that have toprocess mixed questions.Introduction and motivationIn the last few years, the number of blogs hasgrown exponentially.
Thus, the Web containsmore and more subjective texts.
A research fromthe Pew Institute shows that 75.000 blogs arecreated daily (Pang and Lee, 2008).
They ap-proach a great variety of topics (computer sci-ence, sociology, political science or economics)and are written by different types of people, thusare a relevant resource for large community be-havior analysis.
Due to the high volume of datacontained in blogs, new Natural Language Proc-essing (NLP) resources, tools and methods areneeded in order to manage their language under-standing.
Our fist contribution consists in carry-ing out a multilingual research, for English andSpanish.
Secondly, many sources are present inblogs, as people introduce quotes from newspa-per articles or other information to support theirarguments and make references to previous postsin the discussion thread.
Thus, when performinga task such as Question Answering (QA), manynew aspects have to be taken into consideration.Previous studies in the field (Stoyanov, Cardieand Wiebe, 2005) showed that certain types ofqueries, which are factual in nature, require theuse of Opinion Mining (OM) resources and tech-niques to retrieve the correct answers.
A furthercontribution this paper brings is the analysis anddefinition of the criteria for the discriminationamong types of factual versus opinionated ques-tions.
Previous researchers mainly concentratedon newspaper collections.
We formulated andannotated of a set of questions and answers overa multilingual blog collection.
A further contri-bution is the evaluation and comparison of twodifferent approaches to QA a fact-oriented oneand another designed for opinion QA scenarios.Related workResearch in building factoid QA systems has along history.
However, it is only recently thatstudies have started to focus also on the creationand development of QA systems for opinions.Recent years have seen the growth of interest inthis field, both by the research performed and thepublishing of various studies on the requirements157and peculiarities of opinion QA systems (Stoy-anov, Cardie and Wiebe, 2005), (Pustejovskyand Wiebe, 2006), as well as the organization ofinternational conferences that promote the crea-tion of effective QA systems both for general andsubjective texts, as, for example, the Text Analy-sis Conference (TAC)1.
Last year?s TAC 2008Opinion QA track proposed a mixed setting offactoid (?rigid list?)
and opinion questions(?squishy list?
), to which the traditional systemshad to be adapted.
The Alyssa system (Shen etal., 2007), classified the polarity of the questionand of the extracted answer snippet, using a Sup-port Vector Machines classifier trained on theMPQA corpus (Wiebe, Wilson and Cardie,2005), English NTCIR2 data and rules based onthe subjectivity lexicon (Wilson, Wiebe andHoffman, 2005).
The PolyU (Wenjie et al,2008) system determines the sentiment orienta-tion with two estimated language models for thepositive versus negative categories.
TheQUANTA (Li, 2008) system detects the opinionholder, the object and the polarity of the opinionusing a semantic labeler based on PropBank3 andsome manually defined patterns.EvaluationIn order to carry out our evaluation, we em-ployed a corpus of blog posts presented in(Boldrini et al, 2009).
It is a collection of blogentries in English, Spanish and Italian.
However,for this research we used the first two languages.We annotated it using EmotiBlog (Balahur et al,2009) and we also created a list of 20 questionsfor each language.
Finally, we produced the GoldStandard, by labeling the corpus with the correctanswers corresponding to the questions.1.1 QuestionsNo TYPE QUESTION1FFWhat international organization do people criticize forits policy on carbon emissions?

The firstcan be the ambiguity of the questions e.g.
?Ded?nde viene la riqueza de EEUU?.
The answercan be explicitly stated in one of the blog sen-tences, or a system might have to infer themfrom assumptions made by the bloggers and theircomments.
Moreover, most of the opinion ques-tions have longer answers, not just a phrase snip-pet, but up to 2 or 3 sentences.
As we can ob-serve in Table 2, the questions for which theTQA system performed better were the pure fac-tual ones (1, 3, 4, 8, 10 and 14), although in somecases (question number 14) the OQA system re-trieved more correct answers.
At the same time,opinion queries, although revolving around NEs,were not answered by the traditional QA system,but were satisfactorily answered by the opinionQA system (2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12).
Questions 18 and20 were not correctly answered by any of the twosystems.
We believe the reason is that question18 was ambiguous as far as polarity of the opin-ions expressed in the answer snippets (?im-provement?
does not translate to either ?positive?or ?negative?)
and question 20 referred to thetitle of a project proposal that was not annotatedby any of the tools used.
Thus, as part of the fu-ture work in our OQA system, we must add acomponent for the identification of quotes andtitles, as well as explore a wider range of polar-ity/opinion scales.
Furthermore, questions 15, 16,18, 19 and 20 contain both factual as well asopinion aspects and the OQA system performedbetter than the TQA, although in some cases,answers were lost due to the artificial boosting ofthe queries containing NEs of the EAT (Ex-pected Answer Type).
Therefore, it is obviousthat an extra method for answer ranking shouldbe used, as Answer Validation techniques usingTextual Entailment.
In Table 3, the OQA missedsome of the answers due to erroneous sentencesplitting, either separating text into two sentenceswhere it was not the case or concatenating twoconsecutive sentences; thus missing out on oneof two consecutively annotated answers.
Exam-ples are questions number 16 and 17, wheremany blog entries enumerated the different ar-guments in consecutive sentences.
Anothersource of problems was the fact that we gave ahigh weight to the presence of the NE of thesought type within the retrieved snippet and insome cases the name was misspelled in the blogentries, whereas in other NER performed by159FreeLing either attributed the wrong category toan entity, failed to annotate it or wrongfully an-notated words as being NEs.
Not of less impor-tance is the question duality aspect in question17.
Bush is commented in more than 600 sen-tences; therefore, when polarity is not specified,it is difficult to correctly rank the answers.
Fi-nally, also the problems of temporal expressionsand the coreference need to be taken into ac-count.Conclusions and future workIn this article, we created a collection of bothfactual and opinion queries in Spanish and Eng-lish.
We labeled the Gold Standard of the an-swers in the corpora and subsequently we em-ployed two QA systems, one open domain, onefor opinion questions.
Our main objective was tocompare the performances of these two systemsand analyze their errors, proposing solutions tocreating an effective QA system for both factoidan opinionated queries.
We saw that, even usingspecialized resources, the task of QA is still chal-lenging.
Opinion QA can benefit from a snippetretrieval at a paragraph level, since in manycases the answers were not simple parts of sen-tences, but consisted in two or more consecutivesentences.
On the other hand, we have seen casesin which each of three different consecutive sen-tences was a separate answer to a question.
Ourfuture work contemplates the study of the impactanaphora resolution and temporality on opinionQA, as well as the possibility to use AnswerValidation techniques for answer re-ranking.AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank Paloma Moreda,Hector Llorens, Estela Saquete and ManuelPalomar for evaluating the questions on their QAsystem.
