An Algorithm for High-Level Organizationof Multi-Paragraph TextsRobert Granvillerg ranv i lOBBN.
COMOur experience with MACH-III \[Kurlaud et al1992\] showed us that there is more to multiparagraphtext than stringing together isolated well-formed paragraphs.
The underlying structure of tile entiretext, depicting interparagraph relationships and emphases, must also be determined for suceessfillgeneration.
Fortunately, RST \[Mann-Thoml)son 1987\] is capable of representing interl)aragraphstructure ms well ms intraparagraph structure, tlowever, RST does not specify how to build largestructures representing multiparagraph text.
This paper presents an algorithm to construct suchnmltiparagraph structures representing a critique of a student's performance in troubleshooting theHAWK radar, as determined by MACH-III.
This critique is based on the functional hierarchy tree(FH tree), which is the heaxt of the expert system component of MACH-III \[Kurland et al1989\].Each student action is judged based on the structure of the FH tree, and where the student iscurrently located in that tree.
The generated critique thus needs to describe each action and howthat action helps or hinders proper navigation through the FH tree.Functional hierarchy is a new paradigm for organizing expert system knowledge bases, based on theprocedural abstraction principles of Liskov and Gutag \[Liskov-Gutag 1986\].
Functional hierarchydiffers greatly from production rules (the customary basis for an expert system) in that functionalhierarchy rules define the actions a system can take, rather than the conditions under which actionsmay take place.
The concept of "action" is expanded to include all actions the system takes,including control decisions, rather than just changes to the database, thereby eliminating the needfor a separate control structure.
These rules are arranged in a hierarchy, where the action of a ruleis defined as a combination of other actions.Our algorithm does not need an elaborate component to build a plan resulting in an RST for tworeasons.
The first is that the desired output text is a non-interactive monologue of written text,rather than text that models interactive dialogue, as in the text of Moore's system \[Moore 1989\].Therefore, we don't need information for revising text in reaction to a listener's misunderstanding.The second is that the database from which we are generating consists of the MACH-III functionalhierarchy trees.
These FH trees are structured purposely to explicitly reflect the very organizationwe need to explain.
Because of these FH trees, we don't have to build plans to determine textstructure, and the job of organizing the text, that is, building RST structures i  greatly simplilied.As stated above, the purpose of our generated text is describe student actions in the course of aradar troubleshooting session, and how these actions relate to the organization i the FH trees.
Inthemselves, these actions are completely independent.
The way RST organizes events that have no19relationship between them other than tile ordcr in which they occurred is with the SEQUENCErelationship.This leaves tile problem of tile higher organization of tile text, that is, where to break paragraphs inthe lIST.
It was argued in \[Granville 1990\] that the structural organization of a text is as importantto the message to be conveyed as its factual content.
Therefore, any artificial metric for paragraphs,such as limiting them to a specific number of sentences, must be unsatisfactory, flowever, theproblem is not so daunting when we consider the purpose of a paragraph, which is to describeone idea or topic.
The obvious topic category for our text consists of events in the course oftroubleshooting that require explanation.
The two events in the MACII- I I I  domain that requireexplanation are mistakes committed by the student, which are mistakes in navigating through theFII trees, and milestones telling the student when branches in the FtI trees are entered or completed.The mistake or milestone being explained is obviously the topic of the explanation, and thereforedeserves its own paragraph.
Mistakes and milestones that have already been explained don't requirefull explanations again, and therefore don't merit paragraph treatment.This does not completely solve the problem, however.
Depending on the FH tree and the studentactions, we may have a set of actions requiring no detailed explanation but is still too large to describein a single paragraph.
This problem can be solved if we rememl~er that the ultimate goal of our textis to explain how actions should reflect, the FI1 tree organization of the troubleshooting knowledge.By causing paragraph hreaks when new FII tree I.~ranehes are enl.ered, our text explicitly reflectsthe FH tree organization.
Another problem is that we may want to avoid a para.graph break aftera detailed explanation, if the next text item is closely related, such as a single student action thatis an error needing an explanation which also happens to start a new FII branch.
Therefore, if twoconsecutive items are closely related, such as due to arising from the same action, or a repetitionof an action, they will appear in the same paragraph, even though the first item would cause aparagraph break under normal circumstances.A brief example will help make these ideas concrete.
Assume a MACH-II I  student is presentedwith an LO fault, indicating that the local oscillator (the LO) is either malfunctioning or not beingmonitored correctly.
Our student performs four actions, each with a mistake.
He first tests the W2cable, a component of the I IAWK radar that can't cause an LO fault even if the cable itself is faulty.In MACH-II I ,  this is known as an OUT OF 'FREE mistake, because since the W2 can't cause an1,O fault, it doesn't appear in the subtree of the functional hierarchy that deals with LO faults.Our student next replaces the A l l  card, a component that could cause the fault.
Ilowever, he failsto follow this action with a test of the system (known as a BITE test) to see if the A 11 was in factthe ca.use of the problem.
MACII- I I I  ca.lls this an EXPECTEI )  BITE TEST mistake.The student's third action is to test the W8 cable.
Like the W2, the W8 cannot possibly cause anLO fault, so this is again an OUT OF TREE mistake.Finally, the student tests the P12J3 plug.
This component can cause an LO fault, so it isn't anOUT OF TREE problem.
However, testing the A l l  card is part of determining whether the localoscillator is being monitored correctly, while testing the P12J3 is part of determining whether thelocal oscillator itself is malfunctioning.
As stated above, one of the goals of MACtI- I I I  is to teachstudents the organization exhibited in the functional hierarchy tree.
Therefore, jumping aroundfrom topic to topic, as our student is doing here, is flagged as a SKIPPING fault.When the first action is encountered, the OUT OF TP~EE mistake hasn't been explained yet, so the20action of testing the W2 and the OUT OF TREE problem warrant heir own paragraph detailingwhy OUT OF TREE actions are mistakes.
Similarly, replacing the All card requires a separateparagraph to explain the EXPECTED BITE TEST problem.
The third action, testing the W8,does not force a paragraph break on its own, since it exhibits the OUT OF TREE mistake, whichhas already been explained.
Instead, it merely mentions the problem, and the paragraph continues.The final action of testing the P12J3 does exhibit a new problem, though, namely SKIPPING.
It isadded to the third paragraph in a sequence relationship, and this paragraph is closed off because ofthe required explanation.
The resulting RST looks like the following:TEXTJI PARAGRAPH I SEQUENCE I. .
