Project Penlight - A Government PerspectiveMichael J.

The greaterpart of its effort was to go into the design and implemen-tation of the coreference ngine.
The second task,essentially an independent effort, was to automaticallydetect discourse segments.The University of Pennsylvania has been very suc-cessful in developing the coreference engine.
The workin this area has been recognized as valuable by otherresearchers in the Summarization effort.
As a result, theUniversity will be making its coreference software(known as CAMP) available to the research communityon the World Wide Web.
The potential importance ofthis work as a whole to the automatic text surnmariza-tion effort has caused the Government toslighly re-alignits priorities over the course of the first two contractyears.
The Government instructed the University ofPennsylvania tospend almost all of its efforts in improv-ing the coreference resolution engine and making itavailable to the research community rather than apply-ing this engine to the problems of text summarization.While the results of the coreference resolutiondevelopment work have been impressive, the re,suits ofthe application of this effort to text summarization havealso achieved success, particularly in the area of query-specific summarization.
The University of Pennsylvaniaapproach is to resolve all coreferences within the fulltext to the query and select all sentences which arecoreferent.
Results from the dry-run and SUMMACevaluations imply that coreference r solution is a neces-sary element of good summarization.The University of Pennsylvania continues its effortsin resolving cross-document coreference which will benecessary to perform multi-document summarization.33
