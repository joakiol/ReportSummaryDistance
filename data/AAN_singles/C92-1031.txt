The core idea of sucha descr ip t ion  of order ing is const i -tuted by creat ing a type lat t ice forl ists.
The poss ib i l i t ies  of express ingd i f ferent  approaches to word order inthe f ramework are br ie f ly  discussed,exempl i f ied  and compared to othermethods.In the standard immediate-con-s t i tuent  based approaches,  the "free"word order  I is descr ibed e i ther  di-rect ly  in the phrase-s t ructure  (PS)rules, wh ich  thus express s imul tane-ous ly  both dominance (mother/daughter)re la t ions  and precedence (ordering)re lat ions  between syntact ic  cate-gories, or, in more recent formal ismssuch as GPSG or HPSG, by the l inearprecedence  (LP) rules c reat ing  a sepa-rate component  of the grammar,  whoseother  component  is the set of immedi-a te -dominance  (ID) rules.
In both the-se cases, the order ing const ra in ts  arel im i ted  to sister const i tuents,  i.e.they are str ict ly  local.One of the prob lems of boththese var iat ions  of the s tandard  PS-approach is the descr ip t ion  of ad-juncts (free modif iers) .
On the usualassumpt ion  that their number per clau-se is in pr inc ip le  not l imi ted  (thoughf in i te for a part icu lar  clause), anapproach to their order ing presuppos-ing them to be all s ister const i tuentslaust necessar i l y  p resuppose  also an(at least potent ia l ly)  in f in i te  set ofgenerat ive  rules (e.g., a set inducedby a K leene star used in a "basic"var iant  of one of the rules).In languages whose grammar  al-lows for more word order  f reedom thanEng l i sh  2, it is often the case thatad juncts  and complements  of a head(typically, but not solely, of a fi-n i te  verb) can be f ree ly  intermixed,which makes the approach where the lo-ca l i ty  of LP const ra ints  forces thehead as well  as its mod i f ie rs  (bothcomplements  and adjuncts) be expandedas s isters sti l l  less at t ract ive.Another  poss ib i l i ty  of de-scr ip t ion  of word order is the "topo-log ica l"  approach used predominant lyin more t rad i t iona l ly  o r iented  Germanl inguist ics .
App l ied  to German, thisapproach div ides a c lause into severalword order "f ie lds" ("Vorfeld","Mitte l fe ld",  "Nachfeld",  " l inke/ rech-te Satzklammer") whose mutua l  pos i t ionis fixed, and studies main ly  the wordorder  regular i t ies  wi th in  these"f ie lds".
Though a lot of work hasbeen done and many va luab le  insightspresented  with in  this paradigm, seenf rom the v iewpoint  of computat iona ll ingu is t i cs  this approach  has thefata l  d i sadvantage  that it is ex-t remely  d i f f icu l t  to formal ize  withinthe s tandard  f rameworks  (e.g., none ofthe "f ie lds" with the poss ib le  ex-cept ion of "Vorfeld" creates  a con-s t i tuent  in any usual  sense etc.
).AS an a l ternat ive  to the two ba-sic approaches ment ioned above (as amod i f i ca t ion  of the f irst one, infact), the descr ipt ion  based  on binaryr ight -branch ing  s t ructures  has beenproposed  independent ly  in severalworks concerned with languages ex-Aca~s DE COL1NG-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~'T 1992 1 8 4 PROC.

However, the price paid forthe removal of some problems, mainly,the free intermixing of heads, comple-ments and adjuncts, of the above-mentioned more standard descriptionsis rather high - at least two problem-atic points arise due to the strictbinarity of the structure.
The firstof them is the fact that in binarystructures no LP-rules relying on therelation "being sister constituent"can be used for ordering heads, com-plements and adjuncts in cases this isrequired, since these are not sistersany more.
The second problematic pointcan be seen at best at the variant ofthe formalism given in (Avgustinovaand Oliva, 1990) the occurrence ofthe phonological ly empty rightmostelement of the branching 3 (c f .
thestructure (1) for the string "Johnkissed Mary yesterday").6The former problem concerning word or-der is in the majority of the binary-branching approaches (as far as theyare at all concerned with it) solvedby introducing word order mechanismswhich are either of non-local natureor which burden the syntactic cate-gories (understood as feature bundles)with otherwise unmotivated featuresused solely for the purpose of im-posing ordering constraints (and mostoften, with a combination of the two).Neither approach is more fortunatethan the other - nonulocality is su-rely an unwished phenomenon in the de-scription, and the presence of specialordering features in the categories ishardly better, i.a.
also because orderis a property of the syntactic struc-ture (made of categories) rather thanof the categories themselves 4 .This paper will try to show thatin spite of the abovementioned reser-vations the "binary branching" can bea correct and fruitful approach tosyntactic description if seen from aslightly different viewpoint.
In orderto get the proper perspective, let usobserve the "binary branching"structure for the example sentence"The small boy ate an apple" shown in(2) .There are several things to betaken into consideration here.The most obvious among them isthe division of the structure into"levels" - contiguous sequences.of no-des with identical marking.

However, the descr ipt ivepower of the approach is not l imitedto this: cases where the number ofe lements  is not given be forehand andtheir  order ing is not absolute can becoped with, too, as well  as cases ofword order combining the two kinds ofrequirements.
For more deta i ls  see(Oliva, 1992).The pr incipal  achievement of theapproach presented is the (re)intro-duct ion of local i ty into b inarybranch ing  structures a l lowing for re-p lac ing the more standard but in thiscase unsu i tab le  concept of order ingconstra ints  holding for sisterconst i tuents  by a very s imi lar  conceptof order ing constraints ho ld ing for alist of const ituents.

The term sort will be used forkinds of feature structures, i.e.
for whatis sometimes used to be cal led type (of afeature structure).
This convent ion willbe used consequent ly and should not, thus,cause n~sunderstanding.
Both types andsorts create their  respective lattices, inpr inciple independent f rom each other.This al lows for using operators &, v andnot for creat ing unif ication, d is junct ionand complement, respectively, of types andsorts.
In the fol lowing examples, typeswill be given as attr ibute-value matr icesenclosed in square brackets, and sorts assubscripts in ital ics of these brackets.7 Reme~r  that the pr inc ip le in the formof an impl icat ion appl ies only if theleft -hand side of the impl icat ion unif ieswith the structure the pr inc ip le  shouldapply on; note also that in the part icu larcase formulated here, the HFP could havebeen s impl i f ied into a conjunct ion of anon- impl icat ion and an impl icat ion parts.8 No form of HFP appl ies on the empty listno inher i tance of features betweenmother and head daughter can occur there,obviously.9 Notwithstanding the part icu lar izat ion(four impl icat ions instead of one instandard HPSG), this stil l should bet reated as a pr inc ip le  - it is a genera-l izat ion holding across kinds of phrases(NP's, irP's etc.
).i0 Typically, but not necessari ly,  conca-tenation.iI Two short remarks seem to be needed onthis spot.
First, here the fact that inGerman the clause cannot be const i tu ted  bya f inite verb alone, is to be coped inother parts of the grantmar (e.g., by thesubcategor izat ion of the verb).
Second,the fact that no afterf ie ld is a l lowed inverb- last  clauses in this example is anarbi trary decision, having l i tt le to dowith the general express ive power of thepresented approach, and even less withgrammar of "real" German.12 Of part icu lar  importance on this spotseem to be the facts that on the approachsketched it is natural ly  possib le to speakabout, e.g., the middlef ie l  d, giving tothis term also a c lear-cut formal izedtreatment bot without forcing it to occuras a true const ituent in the descript ion,as well as the poss ib i l i ty  to specify theposit ion of the verb in verb- f i rst  andverb-second German clauses without re-tort ing to any kind of "movement"mechanism (e.g., to SLASH).AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO6T 1992 1 9 0 PREC.
