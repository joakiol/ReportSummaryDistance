A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF THE VOCABULARY-TEXT RELATIONJuhanTuldavaTartu, Estonia, USSRA new method for calculating vo-cabulary size as a function of textlength is discussed.
The vocabularygrowth is treated as a probabilisticprocess governed by the principle of"the restriction of variety" of lex-ics.
Proceeding from the basic modelof the vocabulary-text relation aformula with good descriptive poweris constructed.
The statistical fitand the possibilities of extrapola-tion beyond the limits of observabledata are illustrated on the materialof several languages belonging to dif-ferent typological groups.by deducing the relation between V andN from some other important quantita-tive characteristics of text such asZipf's law and Yule's distribution(Kalinin, Orlov) 3.
The author under-lines the importance of these concep-tions for the theory of quantitativelinguistics on the whole, but pointsout their insufficiency in solvingsome practical linguo-statisticalproblems where greater exactness andreliability are needed (style-statis-tical analysis, text attribution, ex-trapolation beyond the limits of ob-servable data, etc.).i.
There are a great number of at-tempts to construct an appropriatemathematical model which would ex-press the dependence of the size ofthe size of vocabulary (V) on the sizeof text (N).
This is not only ofpractical importance for the resolu-tion of a series of problems in theautomatic processing of texts, but i tis also connected with the theoreti-cal explanation of some important as-pects of text generation.
In practiceone often makes use of various empir-ical formulae which describe thegrowth of vocabulary with sufficientprecision in the case of concretetexts and languages l, though such for-mulae do not have any general signif-icance.
Of special interest are some"complex" models derived from theo-retical considerations, e.g., by bas-ing one*s considerations on the hypo-thesis about the lognormal distribu-tion of words in a text (Carroll) 2 or2.
Instead of the "complex" mode/sa "direct" method is proposed wherethe relation between V and N is re-garded as the primary component withits own immanent properties in thestatistical organization of text.
Therelation between V and N has to beanalyzed ua the background of some es-sential inner factors of text genera-tion.
The dynamics of vocabularygrowth is considered as the result ofthe interaction of several linguisticand extra, linguistic factors which inan integral way are governed by theprinciple of "the restriction of va-riety" of lexics (an analogue of theprinciple of the decrease of entropyin self-regulating systems).
The con-cept of the variety of lexics is de-fined as the relation between the sizeof vocabulary and the size of text inthe form of V/N (type-token ratio, orcoefficient of variety) or N/V (aver-age frequency of word occurrences).--600--The coefficient of variety is sup-posed to be correlated with the prob-abilistic process of choosing "new"(unused) and "old" (already used inthe text) words at each stage of textgeneration.
The steady decrease of thedegree of variety V/N = p is attendedby the increase of its counterpart:(N -V) /N-  I -V /N= q (p, q -  1),which can be interpreted as the "pres-sure of recurrency" of words in realtexts (analogous to the concept of re-dundancy in the theory of informa-tion) :~ IN- V3.
The formulae of the relation betweenV and N are constructed from the basicmodels: V = Np or V = N(1 - q).For this purpose the quantitativechanges of V/N = p depending on thesize of text are analyzed.
Accordingto the initial hypothesis the rela-tion between V/N and N is approxi-mated by the power function of thetype: V/N = aN B (a and B are con-stants; B < O), which leads to thewell-known formula of G. Herdan@:V = aN b (where b = B + 1).
A verifi-cation shows good agreement with em-pirical data in the initial stagesof text formation (in the limits ofabout ~,OOr~ - 5,000 tokens which cor-respond to a short communication).Later on the rate of the diminishingof the degree of variety (V/N) grad-ually slows down (due to the rise ofnew themes in the course of text gen-eration).
Accordingly the initialformula has to be modified and thiscan be done by logarithmization ofthe variables.
The first attempt givesus in (V/N) = aN B, which leads tosome variants of the Weibull distri-bution.
This kind of distributionshows good agreement with the empir-ical data within the boundaries of atext of medium length, but it is notgood for extrapolation.
Only afterbalancing the initial formula by thelogarithmization of both variables weobtain in (V/N) = a(ln N) B and thecorresponding formula for expressingthe relation between V and N:V = Ne -a(ln N) Bor V = N I - a(ln N)b (where b == B - l) p, which turns out to be themost adequate formula for solving ourproblems.
The constants a and B(which, of course, are not identicalwith those of the previously mention-ed formulae) may be determined on thebasis of linearization: lnln (N/V) == A + B luln N, where A = In a, usingthe method of least squares.
In prin-ciple it would be sufficient to havetwo empirical points for the calcula-tion of the values of the constantsbut for greater reliability morepoints are needed.4.
The good descriptive power ofthe given function and the possibill-601ties of extrapolation in both direc-tions (from the beginning up to a textof about N = lO 7) has been verified onthe basis of experimental materialtaken from several languages belongingto different typological groups (Esto-nian, Kazakh, Latvian, Russian, Po-lish, Czech, Rumanian, English).
Thefunction may be applied to the analy-sis of individual texts as well ascomposite homogeneous (similar) textsand the size of vocabulary (V) may bedetermined by counting either wordforms of lexemes.
(See Tables 1 and 2.
)This seems to corroborate the assump-tion about the existence of a univer-sal law (presumably of phylogeneticorigin) which governs the process oftext formation on the quantitativelevel.Table iThe empirical size (V) and the teoreti-cal size (V') of vocabulary plotted againstthe length of the text (N).
