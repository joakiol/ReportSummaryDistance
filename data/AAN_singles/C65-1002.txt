Thls work  was partly sponsored by the Information Processing Laboratory,Rome Air Deve lopment  Center, United States Air Force, under ContractAF 30(60Z)-3301Andreyewsky  IAbst ractIn a t r ia l  study, about 500 Russ ian  verbs  were  coded using 44potent ia l  c lass i f i ca tory  c r i te r ia .
Through sor t ing  and the in t roduct ionof a metr i c ,  numerous  group ings  were  obtained.
In i t ia l  resu l t s  suggestthat,  with proper  re f inements ,  the approach  descr ibed  cab prov ide use-ful in fo rmat ion  that may be employed  in syntact ic  ana lys i s  and cer ta inin fo rmat ion  re t r ieva l  app l i ca t ions .0.
0 IntroductionAs par t  of a b roader  e f for t  to extend the ex is t ing  t rad i t iona l  par t -o f - speech  c lass i f i ca t ion  in modern  Russ ian ,  th is  study of verbs  is o r ientedtoward  deve lop ing  an improved bas is  for syntact i c  ana lys i s .
Moreover ,it is hoped that the re f inements  in t roduced wil l  be of in teres t  in contentana lys i s .
To th is  end, an extens ive  set of potent ia l  c lass i f i ca tory  c r i -te r ia  has been  se lec ted ,  in the hope that eventua l ly  th is  categor i za t ioncan be opt imized  and extended to o ther  par ts  of speech.I.
0 The Exper imentThe 514 verbs  analyzed came f rom two sources: (a) a randomizedsample  of 370 entries ( I ) and (b) a list of the most  frequently usedRuss ian  verbs  ( Z ) f rom wh ich  the first 144 entries were  selected.The  classificatory criteria, subdivided into two groups, ared iscussed in Section I.
1 below.
General ly,  each  verb  was  taken in apar t i cu la r  mean ing  (s t i ra t ' ,  for ins tance ,  as "to e rase"  and not as "tolaunder" )  and Eng l i sh  equ iva lents  used  so le ly  for  purposes  of ident i f i ca -t ion.
At the same t ime,  for reasons  of conven ience ,  p rov is ions  weremade in coding to a l low for coex is t ing  a l te rnat ives .
Thus,  for p roper -t ies  A and B there  can  be four posBib i l i t ies  which  are  represented  by thefollowing numer ica l  codes:  i - "A",  Z - "B", 3 - "AB" ,  0 - "neitherapplle s"Af ter  the verbs  and appropr ia te  codes  were  punched on cards ,verbs  with ident ica l  codes  were  compared .
To obta in addi t iona l  c lus ter -ing, a p rogram,  wr i t ten  by R. F. Hubbard  for the IBM 7040, comparedthe code vector  of each  card  aga inst  those of the res t  of the sample .The d i s tance  between any two ent r ies  was ca lcu la ted  by taking thesquare  root  of the sum of the squares  of d i s tance  between cor respond-ing pos i t ions  in the i r  code vectors  as def ined by the fo l lowing table:Andreyewsky  20- -0  = 0 0 - -2= 4 I~ i  : 0 I~3  = i 2~3 = i0 - - I=40- -3 :6  l~Z=2 Z- -2=03~3:0i.

4 CommentsThe problems stemming f rom the application of the metric (th "num-bers game") mentioned in I. I. I.
3 reflect a characteristic of statistical infer-ence jocularly compared  by an anonymous author to a bikini bathing suit:being sufficiently suggestive, but not revealing.
In this regard, alternativeapproaches have been considered and will be tried in the near future.
Asit turned out in practice, however, the metric did provide useful insightswhich can point the way toward developing a more  powerful set of classi-ficatory cr i te r ia .
Th is ,  in turn ,  can fos ter  inc reased  re l iance  on s implesor t ing  procedures  based  on proper  rank ing  and group ing  of the c r i te r iathemse lves .While not unexpectedly, the verbs of motion in the broad sense ofthe term came out more  clearly in the classification than did any othergroups, interesting subclasses of abstract verbs, exhibiting unexpectedshades  of va luat ion  also emerged.Andreyewsky  61.

Z Test IIIn contrast to Test I, this test placed a relatively lesser emphasison syntagmatlc relationships and stressed a mixture of formal and seman-tic properties.
On  the whole, except where noted, the two tests weredeveloped independently of one another.
While Test I was based on mater-ials derived f rom the Academy Grammar  of Russian ( 3 )0 Test II bene-fited f rom experience gained in dealing with the problems encountered inmachine translation output and f rom studies conducted preparatory tolaunching syntactic analysis.1.

Thus, otdokhnut' (to rest)  (8) utikhnut' (to quiet down), and(10) ugasnut'  (to become extinguished} or nabryz~at '  (to sprinkle on), (Z)nakinut' (.to throw on), (3) vzval i t '  (to pile on), and (4) nastroc i t '  (to sew on)are some of the examples.In other cases, apparently incongruous groups llke the following:strekotat' (to chirr), (1) moshennlcat' (to swlndle), (5) fokusnlchat' (to juggle),(5) nakrapyvat' (to sprinkle), (5) mertsat' (to twinkle) (6) zvenet' (to ring)emerged.
However, upon closer examination it became apparent thatnakrapyvat', mertsat', and zvenet' fall in a group clearly distinguishable fromthe one containing the other verbs.
Further, fokusnlchat' and zvenet' showedsufficient distance within re spective groups sugge sting at least four differentbasic groups in all.Andreyewsky  91.

4 CommentsAside f rom the prob lems traceable to statistics, the sets of cr iterlaselected for Test II are more  open to debate than those found in Test I. How-ever, correlations between both tests indicate that some of the criteria arerelevant and that others are, at least, redundant.
As  observed f rom minordifferences in two versions of coding of nine verbs introduced six monthsapart ,  the resu l t s  of Tes t  II a re  less  re l iab le .I.

1.4, to theextent  that the resu l t s  of the app l i ca t ion  of the metr i c  tend to supp lementsor t ing ,  the resu l t s  of Test  II tend to back  up many of the f indings of Test  I.Given a small sample, it is difficult to make  any generalizations.
Atthe same time, the evidence emerg ing so far suggests some subtle differencesin the two tests.
Basically, in both cases the results of the metric applica-tion show little or no discrimination between antonyms.
However,  the group=Ings resulting f rom Test II tend to be, if at all, held together by similarityof content ,  the resu l t s  of Tes t  I, in cont ras% have a pecu l ia r  sor t  of out-ward ,  fo rmal  s imi la r i ty  in the man i fes ta t ion  of p rocesses  descr ibed  by theverbs  in quest ion.Z.
0 The OutlookIn the months ahead, it is hoped that the small corpus can be increasedand the time required to code each entry reduced to reasonable proportions.While in many respects the results of:both tests are self-proving, rigorousevaluation criteria will have to be formulated in detail.As  far as potential application of the results obtained is concerned,especially the information derivable f rom Test I could be immediately put touse to improve (together with classification of nouns currently in progress)the t rans la t ion  of verb -governed  prepos i t iona l  phrases .
It is l i ke ly  that thissyntagmat ic  pat tern ing  wi l l  extend to la rger  s t ruc tures  dominated  by theverb .
