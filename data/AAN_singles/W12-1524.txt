INLG 2012 Proceedings of the 7th International Natural Language Generation Conference, pages 134?135,Utica, May 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsPrefaceGeneration Challenges 2012 (GenChal?12) was the sixth of the annual Genera-tion Challenges umbrella events for shared-task evaluation activities in natural lan-guage generation.
It followed five previous events: the Pilot Attribute Selectionfor Generating Referring Expressions (ASGRE) Challenge hosted by UCNLG+MTin Copenhagen, Denmark in 2007; Referring Expression Generation (REG) Chal-lenges at INLG?08 in Ohio, US; Generation Challenges 2009 at ENLG?09 in Athens,Greece; Generation Challenges 2010 at INLG?10 in Trim, Ireland, and, most re-cently, Generation Challenges 2011 at ENLG?11 in Nancy, France.
More informa-tion about all these events can be found via the links on the Generation Challengeshomepage (http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal12).Like its predecessor events, GenChal?12 had a Future Task Proposals Trackwhere researchers were invited to submit papers describing ideas for shared tasksto be run in the future.
The responses to this call are the last three papers in theGenChal?12 part of the present volume.
White?s paper on a Syntactic ParaphraseReranking task is explicitly proposed as a further development on the outcomesof the Surface Realisation task, with the emphasis on methods to rank realisationalternatives.
Banik et al?s KBGen task proposal focuses on generation of text fromstructured knowledge sources, while Bouayad-Agha et al?s proposal focuses onmethods for content determination in NLG from semantic web data.GenChal?12 also included a progress report on the Surface Realisation sharedtask, currently organised by Anja Belz, Bernd Bohnet, Simon Mille, Leo Wannerand Michael White.
The report, which can be found at the beginning of the Gen-Chal?12 part of this volume, describes current work on the SR Task?s common-ground input representations and plans for the next edition of the task, SR?13.The GenChal?12 session at INLG?12 included two further presentations, onean update report on the Question Generation Challenge organised by Vasile Rus,Arthur Graesser and Paul Piwek, which did not run this year.
The other was asummary report on the second edition of the Helping Our Own task (HOO?12) or-ganised by Robert Dale, whose full results session was this year hosted at BEA?12.HOO?12 was based on a much more focused task definition than its 2011 prede-cessor.
While HOO?11 addressed the automatic correction of a very broad rangeof errors in scientific articles in English by non-native authors, this year?s editionwas centred on errors related to the use of determiners and prepositions.
This focuswas partly motivated by the results of HOO?11.
HOO?12 attracted 14 participatingteams.Preparations are already underway for a seventh NLG shared-task evaluationevent next year, Generation Challenges 2013, which may be organised as part ofENLG?13.
Hopefully, this will include new tasks from among those proposed in134the Future Task Proposals Track of GenChal?11 and GenChal?12.
Many of thenew proposals share an emphasis on fostering collaboration with members of otherresearch communities, and will, it is to be hoped, serve to broaden the interest intasks related to the generation of natural language.Many people contribute to making Generation Challenges happen each year.This year, we would like to thank in particular the INLG?12 organisers, Barbara diEugenio and Susan McRoy for hosting GenChal?12, and the shared task organisingteams for all their hard work.June 2012 Anja Belz and Albert GattGeneration Challenges Steering Committee:Anja Belz, University of Brighton, UKRobert Dale, Macquarie University, AustraliaAlbert Gatt, University of Malta and Unversity of Aberdeen, UKKevin Knight, ISI, University of Southern California, USAAlexander Koller, Saarland University, GermanyChris Mellish, Aberdeen University, UKJohanna Moore, Edinburgh University, UKAmanda Stent, Stony Brook University, USAKristina Striegnitz, Union College, USA135
