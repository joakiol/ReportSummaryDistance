An Approach to Non-Singular Terms in DiscourseTomek StrzalkowskiSchool of Computing ScienceSimon Fraser UniversityBurnaby.
B.C.. CANADAV5A IS6AbstractA new Theory of Names and Descriptions that offers a uniformtreatment for many types of non-singular concepts found in naturallanguage discourse is presented.
We introduce a layered model of thelanguage denotational base (the universe) in which every world objectJs assagned a layer (level) reflecting its relative singularity with respecttn other objects in the universe, We define the notion of relativesingularity of world objects as an abstraction class of the layer-membership relation1.
IntroductionLinguistic (and related) literature describes numerous forms ofnon-singular concept~ that can be found in discourse including inten-sional (or functional) concepts, mass concepts, generic (or general)concepts attributive concepts, abstract concepts, etc.
\[I\], \[2\].
13\]\[4\] 16\] \[10\] Not all of these approaches could properly capture thedistinction between singular and non-singular interpretation of linguis-tic descriptions, and some were originally devised to deal with singularterms only (such as Donnellan's attributive interpretation of definitedescriptions \[2\]).
With the exception of intensional concepts, thesenotions have not been given satisfactory formal representations thatwould account for their role in natural language discourse.
Perhapsthe most successful approach to non-singularity thus far has beenpresented by Montague \[4\] with his formalised concept of intension.Unfortunately, the concept of intension does not capture all aspectsof non-singularity and the rigid translation system into intensionallogic \[4\] seems to loose the smportant aspect of subjectivity in inter-preting natural language discourse.
Also, the enormous complexity ofany non trwial system of possible worlds proved to be a bar indeveloping a computationally-oriented application of Montague'stheoryIn this paper we introduce a fragment of a new, and as webelieve, computationally feasible Theory of Names and Descriptionsthat offers a uniform treatment for many types of non-singular con-cepts found in natural language discourse.
Although we limit ourpresentation to nominal phrase constructions, the approach can befurther extended to cover other types of phrases.
In our theory wepresent the formalised definition of non-singularity with respect to aparticular discourse situation involving a discourse message, a numberof individuals (parties), and their knowledge, beliefs, awareness, etc,We introduce a layered model of reality (the universe) as perceived bya discourse participant, and define the notion of relative singularity ofobjects in this universe as an abstraction class of the layer-membership relation Subsequently, linguistic descriptions and namesare classified as singular, measurably singular, or non-singular depend-ing on what they are assumed to denote in the universe The rela-tionship between objects addressed in discourse and classified intodifferent layers (levels) of the universe has a particular significance forresolution of certain types of cohesive links in text.
We call these linksremote references because they cross level boundaries,2.
Non-singular terms in languageMany philosophers and logicians, see \[1\]-\[4\], \[6\], \[10\].
appreciatethat the u~age of the underlined nominal phrases in the following sen-tences has a "general" or "generic" character, except for "regular"singular interpretations which are possible only in some cases.E~ample j(~,d r h ~  wears a crown.
( lb) T~res ident  rs elected every four years.
(lc) Gold is a yellow metal( ld) The temperature is a measure of molecular motion.
:One can imagine hundreds of similar examples involving such non-singular objects as water, beat, the Pope, the number etc Unfor-tunately, there is no commonly accepted account of these species in362philosophical literature Some authors, see \[J\] and \[I0\], cautiouslycalled them generic, or general (for example the king), or functional (such as the number of students, ttre temperature) uses of(definite) descriptions.
Others, like Kripke \[3\].
were quite close toconsider them names (or at least some of them: heat gold).
Yetothers, see Quine \[6, 7\].
advocate the notion of abstract terms asbeing made of attributes, such as /being\] red (further abstracted asredness), or /being\] the man drinking tile martini (which cannotbe so easily uominalized) which can predicate about "concrete"objects.There are numerous striking linguistic puzzles involving non-singular definite descriptions see \[I\].
\[4\], \[5\].
The following exampleillustrates the phenomenonExample2Consider the following inferences:(2a) The temperature is r isingThe temperature is ninety.so, Ninety is rising.
(2b) The president met the Soviet leader many timesThe president is Reaganso.
Reagan met the 5oviet leader many times(2c) The tiger lives in thejungle.My pet is a tiger.so My pet lives in the j ungleThe conclusions in (2a) to (2c) are wrong in general case The expla-nation given by numerous researchers chiefly amounted to the corro-boration that the definite descriptions the temperature, thepresident and the tiger in the first sentences of (2a).
(2b) and (2c)respectively should be interpreted functionally, i.e., as iutensions \[4\],or functions over situations \[1\] Observe that if the descriptions wereto be interpreted singularly or as enumerating all instances of a non-singular object (i.e., statements containing them were understood asmaking claims about each instance), the reasoning would be sound.We claim that unless some two descriptions (or names) are usedsingularly or measurably singularly at the same level no simple,eference can be made between them.
In fact.
another type of refer-ence that we call remote reference can still take place and we shallput this view forward in this paper3.
Tire Theory of  Names and DescriptionsInitially let us observe that our language deals with singularobjects only, no matter how complex their structure happens to beSuppose somebody is being put into posihon of the Observer whoperceives all these objects and has to use his language to describethem Some objects are sharply distinguished from others so hechooses to give them names as John, Mary, Fatsy.
Sun, .. Theothers have no clearly perceivable boundaries but he still may namethem: tea.
water, grass, snow ..... and then refer to some measur-able quantities of them as some tea, l itt le snow.
etc, Yet othersappear to be numerous, though enumerable, displaying strong similari-ties to one another.
It would be pointless for Observer to give themeach a name Instead.
he decides to refer to them as a cow, the man.this tree etc Still.
he prefers to say the sun or the lake rather thanto invent new names if he is not sure how many of them are there,even if he is aware of just one specimen LaLer tie may find out thatsome objects were gwen identical names, so having encountered themtogether he must refer to one as the John.
the Sun, or a Fatsy.Having completed his job Observer, who is also a part of this world,may name h~mself Observer or the Observer, and happily sit downunder a tree on the grassLet us call the whole collection of objects he has just describedas the Observer level and use the symbol L 0 for it Suppose thenwe ask Observer to tell us as much as he can about L 0 Soon he findsout that his naming has its limits As he discovers new facts abouthis world it becomes more and more cumbersome for him to com-municate in terms of every man.
some cats.
several trees, eachpresident, etc He discovers that some things be originally considereddistinct appear to be instances of some single object.
Also he mustadmit that the identity of some other objects has to be put into ques-tion Being smart enough.
Observer invents two new levels.
L+1 andL_j.
which augment his world.
At level L+I he places the new objectshe discovered to be generalisations (or abstractions, if you like) ofsome measurable amount of objects from L 0 which displayed astriking similarity or even identity.
From the perspective of L+l he isable to tell us that Tire tiger lives in the .jungle.
that Thepresident is elected every four years, and that The Morning Starand The Evening Star are actually two appearances of  tire plar~etVenus.
The objects at L+I are singular there, bnt they appear gen-eric" or "functional" or whatever of thai sort as seen from L 0.Observe that these objects may not have straightforward measurablysingular descriptions at L 0 (like every tiger, some president, etc).and often it will not be possible to refer to them in the terms of thelanguage available at L(~.
In either case one may expect that someundescribable aspect of an L+I object can emerge at L n. even if theyall have been derived from L 0 (which does not have to be the case).Next Observer invents a new generation of names at L+l.
thepresident and the tiber may be among those names.
On the otherhand Observer might prefer to use definite descriptions here.
for thesimilar reason he frequently decided so at L\[).
In fact.
we have nomeans to distinguish between names and definite descriptions indiscourse We (.an only stick to linguistic conveutions.It probably would not take a long time before a new augmenta-tion for L+( becomes necessary.
Two new levels L+1+1 and L+I_ t carlbe added in a much the same fashion The level L+~_ 1does not neces-sarily have to be L0 although it probably will.
More or less the samehappens at the level /._1 where Observer can now say that what hepreviously considered to be the atom actually denotes marry differentkinds of atoms (H. O Ca.
Fe etc.
), that tea is not so uniform andmany different teas can be found, and that under the name JoeSmith was actually hidden a group of crime story writers.
Subse-quently the level L-1 will expand by L_I+ ( and L-a-( with the formeroften different than L 0.
Let us now formalize our intuitionDefinition :1A use of a description will be called singular if it denotes or refers toa singular object.
A use of a description will be called measurablysingular if it denotes or refers to some measurable quantity of asingular object.
Otherwise we shall talk of non-singular use.Definition 2A level will be an arbitrary collection of singular objects.
A levellanguage will contain these and only singular and measurably singularuses of descriptions communicating of the level objects.Definition 3For any level L~.
all names appearing in tbe L, language have singularinterpretations.Definition 4For any level L n there will be at least two distinct levels L~ l and L,+ 1such that L,,+l contains the non-singular objects as seen from L,.
andL,-t contains the objects for which the objects at L, are non-singularDefinition 5Tbe Observer level L o is an arbitrary chosen level serving as a refer-ence pointSuppose that we have an object N called N at level L 0.
Let Tbe an arbitrary set we shall refer to as a coordinate.
Suppose furtherthat.
for the coordinate T. the Observer discovers that the identity ofN along that dimension can no longer be accepted.
That is.
there areat least two x. y E T such that N at x ~: N at y.
Without losing gen-erality we can assume that the coordinate T has been chosen so thatthe following non-equation holds:?
Vx.y ~ T .x~y, (N~)  ~(Ny)Let (N x) denote an object N x for some x E T. The Observer cannot?
place Nx's at L0 without violating definitions 2 and 3 Instead hemoves them onto a new level L_Nt 7 leaving the original object N at L0.N may be no longer a "real" object but the concept remains inlanguage LNt 7 can be attached to any existing level provided that thedefinitions 1 to 4 will never be violated It can also give a beginning toa new level.
Note that the distribution of N over the coordinate Tforces otber objects from L 0 to be distributed over T as well.
andtheir instances placed at LN_I T This process may remain mostly impli-cit until we mm(e an utterance relating (N x) to other objects at LN_i T.In general we shall say that the level L_Ni T is lower than the level L 0,and write L~_lf<Lo Often we shall drop the superscripts N and Tover the level symbol assuming some lower level L_~ whenever it doesriot lead to ambiguity Observe that with the above account the levelstructure of objects has a dynamic, ever-changing character.
Ally newempirical fact to be added to our world knowledge bears a potentialreveberation in the level structure involving creation of new levels andmoving objects between levels.
At probably non-frequent idle statesthe definitions 1 to 4 assure the structure balanceMoving at level L_ 1 the Observer is aware of an enumerable col-lection of different objects N,'s Extending the description used for Nover N,'s the Observer refers to them as the N. a N. some N(s).every N. etc.
It is possible, of course, that some other object N'found at L 0 is now disclosed to be an Nx for some x (~ T. What thatmeans is that we have wrongly placed N" at L 0. because it actuallybelonged to L_ l 13ut this was right at the time N" was placed there.ie .
it mirrored tbe state of onr knowledge of the world at the time.We may now give names to some Nx's and N can very well happenamong them.
This time however N will not denote the old object fromL0: this will be actually quite a different name referring to oneselected N,.
and which may be replaced by a definite description of(N~)On the other hand suppose we tlave some objects N l, N 2,considered distim:t at L 0 Suppose then that we discover someresemblance between them along some dimension (coordinate) T. sothat we need a generalizing concept to talk about them.
We climb tosome higher level L~I 7-. i.e L0<LNI 7. and establish a new object asuperobject N there Now as seen from LN+j T all N/s are just theoccurences of N at L 0 at different values of coordinate T In otherwords, the following equation holds:?
Vi  Ix .x~ T , (Nx)=NiObserve also that all Ni's now belong to the level N T L+l--1 which is apart of Lo As before we shall drop superscripts N and T for simpli-city.
No matter how we name N at L+I the following Formula ofDiscovery summarizes our action:(FD) VxVy.
x.y e T .
(Nx)  =(Ny)Remember that the formula FD is valid only when observed from L+IAt L 0.
Ni's remain distinct traditionally - so they remain distinct inthe language as well.
The generalisation of other objects from Loonto LN+\] T may follow but.
as in tbe case of decomposition discussedabove, the process will remain largely implicit.
Once the superobjectN has been created it begins to live its own life.
Some new objectsfrom L 0 different than N/s.
may now become instances of N at somenot yet utilized values of coordinate T. Also.
we may use descrip-tions (N x) without caring whether they actually refer to any objectsat L 0.
The latter property of general terms which is widely discussedby Qnine \[6 7\] gets a formal explanation in our theory.
It is impor-tant not to confuse a superobject with a set S of lower level instancesover some coordinate T as we would obtain a measurably singularconcept only.
Instead.
a superobject can be identified with the func-tion N from T in to  L 0such that whenever s?Sthen there is a teTsuch that (N t)=s.
and then extended arbitrarily beyond the set SExam Die 3We have the following distinct object at some level L0: V calledVenus.
MS called Morning Star.
and ES called Evening Star.
Upondiscovery that they all are just occnrences of the same planet wecreate a new object V" named Venus at some level LVl "T and suchthat for some ;~.y.z ?
T. where T is a time coordinate.
(V';~) = V (V" v) =MS.
(V 'z )  = ES.
According to the FD for-mula we conclude from L+1 that V=MS=ES.
while the same conclu-sion made at L n is falseExamp~At level Lo the OI)server is aware of the object TP named ThePresident.
Let T be the time coordinate (different than in the last363example).
At L 0we have according to the FD formula that?

x,y E T (TPx)  =(TPy)Later the Observer may dicover that for some tl.
t2 E T, (TP t l )=Nand (TP t2)=R, aud that at some level LT_~ 'T where N and R belong,they are considered distinct and named Nixon and Reagan respec-tively.
But at L o. R=N is true.
The last observation can be madeclearer if one imagines that TP is some abstract individual which (likeVenus) when observed in early 70's is named Nixon, while whenobserved in 80's is called Reagan, \[\]Definition 6An object N at a level L, is said to be remotely referenced if thereference comes from some level Lnj such that either L,<L~ orLm< L,Typical cases of remote references in discourse have been listedin Example 24.
SuperobjectsLet us now examine the nature of superobjects i.e.. the objectsplaced at level L+l.
It turns out that the plural terms, e.g.presidents, tigers, etc., are actually prototypes of superobJects, see\[6\].
and they should therefore be placed at the same level asrespective superobjects.
We will see that the generalization leadsnaturally to plural terms which may or may not induce equivalentsingular superobjects.
Conversely.
a plural equivalent o a superobjectmay suggest the most natural coordinate to decompose the latteronto some lower level.
When a superobject lacks a plural equivalent,however, we may admit that this object's origin has been traceddown.
A further decomposition is still possible but this process mayoften produce objects that will never assume an independent statusand will remain recognized only as instances of- this general conceptscattered over that or another coordinate This phenomenon ischaracteristic of the so-called mass objects and their correspondingmass terms Quite naturally the question of- where one level endsand another begins arises The following example gives some insightinto the problem of level boundaries.Exampl?5Consider the following sentences.
(Sa) Mary brings (some) water every day.Let water in (5a) be the name of some superobject w at the level L+I.Presumably Mary brings only a part of w but we can say that w isbeing brought by Mary every day This is the same w every day,although each time possibly a different part of it is in transit, whichleads to the obvious translation (at L+I )(i) 5a --, (br -e -d  M w)where br -e -d  stands for brings every day.
'On the other hand.
suppose that Mary brings some water every day.Except for the above interpretation, we also have the measurablysingular reading at L0 where w is scattered over some coordinate Tso that ~tE T such that (W t) is being brought by Mary.
i.e..(~t (br M (w t))).
This clause is, of course, relative to every day soat L 0 we could have(ii) 5a -~ (Vx(dx)  D (~\ ] t (b rM(wt ) ) ) ) twhere brines -~ hr.
day ~dBoth translations are essentially equivalent, and this equivalence is byno means accidental.
It lends a strong support for our Theory ofNames and Descriptions.
and explains the intuition underlying its for-mulation.5.
ConclusionIn this paper we presented a new approach to representing various kinds of non-singular concepts in natural language as the Theoryof Names and Descriptions.
-I-he major observation of the Theory isthat reality, as perceived by an intelligent individual, can be regardedas a partially ordered structure of levels such that each level containsonly those objects which are considered relatively singular Observet To be precise we should represent Mary as (M l) here.
i.e.. as an instance ofthe L 41 object M at some I E T. However.
our nanling convention discussed in section3 allows for replacing lhe definite description by a new name at the level L 0.
We shallutilize this option here.364that there are virtually no restrictions imposed upon the notion ofrelative singularity so that the distribution of objects between levelsof the world model may differ among different individuals.
Non-singular objects, called superobjects, are placed at a number of higherlevels which are related to the current level with various coordinatesConversely.
a singular object may be decomposed along a coordinate.and new objects, so obtained, will be placed at some lower level.
Thissame coordinate can be used then to obtain instances of other objectsat this lower level, so that the relative singularity of objects withineach level is maintained For more details concerning various aspectsof tile theory the reader is referred to \[8\] and \[g\]AcknowledgementsTile author would like to thank Dr. Nick Cercone and Dr. JimDelgrande for their comments and suggestions that helped to intprovethe quality of this paper This research was supported in part by theNatural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada underOperating Grant number A4309, by the Office of the Academic Vice-President Simon Fraser University, and by the SFU's Open GraduateScholarship Thank the LCCR for use of facilities,References\[1\] Barwise J J Perry (1983) Situations and Attitudes.
