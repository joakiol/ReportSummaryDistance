Speaker's Intentions and Beliefs in Negative ImperativesBarbara Di Eugenio *tDepartment of Computer  and Information ScienceUniversity of PennsylvaniaPhiladelphia, PA, USAdieugeni@linc.cis.upenn.eduOne of the questions asked of the participants to the workshop is What is the evidence for theexistence of intentions?
What types of intentions are useful to identify for communication?The former part of the question has already been positively answered by many researchers,such as \[GS86; GS90\], \[LC91\], \[LA90\]; the same answer emerges fl'om the abstracts ubmittedto the workshop, and I will therefore take it for granted.I will focus on the latter part of the question, and I will try to provide an answer by takingwhat seems to me a necessary preliminary step, namely, by identifying the factors underlyingthe speaker's communicative intentions.
Some of these factors have been identified - -  forexample by \[LA90; Po186\] - -  as the beliefs and intentions that the speaker (S for short, andreferred to with feminine pronouns) believes the hearer (H for short, and referred to withmasculine pronouns) has prior to the current utterance, and the new ones H will adopt as aconsequence of the utterance.The analysis of such factors can be further finessed: one that is very pervasive in instructionaltext is the choices that S believes II has with respect to acting.
While acting, an agel l tis contimmlly faced with a.n infinite number of choices, of which the vast majority are notconsciously considered, because they don't matter in the situation at hand.
One task S isfaced with, then, is to identify which choices matter, and to constrain the alternatives.
I amgoing to show that the surface form of the utterance is affected by S's beliefs about the choicesthat H may either intentionally make or unintentionally overlook.
In my previous work, I haveidentified how the choice among alternative courses of actions is constrained hy the goal thatan action is meant to achieve, and how these constraints are expressed and computed in thecase of purpose clauses \[Di 92; DW92\].
More evidence of the fact that S identifies and prunesH's possible choices is given by negative imperatives, and on those I want to concentrate inthis contribution.Why is it appropriate to try to understand the factors underlying S's intentions in the work-shop?
Consider for example Delin, Scott and Hartley's contribution \[DSH93\], which is par-ticularly relevant to my interests because they work on instructional text.

Thanks to all the members of theAnimNL group, and in particular to Bonnie Webber, for very stimulating and helpful discussions.11them are the \[speaker's\] deep and shallow intentions, where the former is characterized as the,vpresentation of IS's\] intentions that \[H\] perform the sequence of actions that constitute aparticular task, while the latter is a representation of the goals that the text has to achievein order to motivate the required tasks.
What is not specified in \[DSH93\] is how the shallowintcutions are formed on the basis of the deep intentions: it seems to me that factors such asthe choices that S believes H has to face in acting play an important role in this process.Hearer's choices and negative imperativesOne could take tim simple position that S's intention in uttering a negative imperative isto prevent a certain course of action on the part of H. However, we can finesse things byrecognizing that,  from S's point of view, a negative imperative is produced when?
S believes II to be aware of a certain choice point, but expects him to choose the wrongaltenJative among many .... possibly infinite - -  ones.?
S expects tl to overlook a choice point.
The choice point is sometimes identified througha side effect that  the wrong choice will cause.There appears to be a correlation between these two kinds of expectations and the two differ-(,t,l, classes of negative imperatives I ha.v(; identified, DONT and neg-TC.
DON7' iml)eratives('<)ml)rise negative imperatives proper, characterized either by the negative auxiliary don'l orI)y negative polarity items; the other class is formed by verl)s such as take care, be sure andthe like h)llowed by a negative infinitival complement, lAs far as semantics goes, it is clear that a DONT imperative could be used when a neg-TCone is used: an expression like take care not to do a entails don't do a.
In fact, in terseinstructions only DONT imperatives are found.
However, in the instructional texts I haveexamined, the two perform different functions.DONT imperat ives  are used when S thinks that H is likely to come to a choice point, andintentionally choose one course of action over another.
Some situations in which this canhal)pen are:?
When S provides H with general goals, or with rules of behavior to be always adopted incertain circumstances, as in( l )  You can put parquet down over a variety of suTfaccs, whether old or new, if theyave firm, clean, .qmooth, and dry.
Don' t  put  parquet  down on a sur face  thatis below ground level because of the moisture problem.1My corpus consists of 36 instances of DONT and 27 of neg-TC imperatives.
I collected the data from two"how-to-do" books plus a few from detergents and cosmetics containers.12?
When S identifies an a.ction a which is an undesirable alternative to another action flthat she tells H to do, a.s in:(2) Caring for the floor.
A good paste wax - not a water-based wax - will give addedprotection to the wood.
Buff  about twice a year; wax about once a year.
Excessivewaxing can cause wax to build up, detracting from the floor appearance.Dust-mop or vacuum your parquet floor as you would carpeting.
Do not scrub orwet -mop the parquet .Clearly, S thinks that H, after adopting the intention of cleaning the parquet, may chooseto do so in a wrong way.
Notice that using a neg-TC verb in this case would be infelicitous,as it would seem to imply that H could unintentionally choose to perform either scrubor wet-mop.Neg-TC imperat ives  are used when S expects H to overlook a certain choice point; suchchoice point may be identified through a possible side effect.
Moreover, a neg-TC seemsto be used only when S relates the negated action a to another action fl in the discourse- -  in contrast, DONT imperatives can be used independently of other actions mentioned indiscourse, as in warnings like In case of fire don't use the elevator.
A form like "Do/3.
7hkecare not to do a"  appears to be used when?
a. is a.n undesirable way of performing ft.
The description of fl is always underspecilied,and therefore H has many degrees of freedom in executing it.
Consider(3) To make a piercing cut, first drill a hole in the waste stock on the interior of thepattern.
The diameter of the hole must be larger than the width of the blade.
If  youwant to save the waste stock for later use, drill the hole near a corner in the pattern.Be careful  not to drill th rough the pat tern  line.fl is drill a hole near a corner in the pattern.
The interpretation of near still leaves Hsome choices as regards the exact position where to drill: S constrains them by rulingout a "drill \[a hole near a corner in the pattern\] through the pattern line".Notice the difference in the relations between the actions involved in Exs.
2 and 3: ill tileformer, there exists a third action 7 "clean parquet" such that a "scrub" and fl "vacuum"are alternative ways of achieving it; in the latter, there is no such 7, and a is directlyrelated to fl as one of its possible specializations.?
ra, is an undesirable ffect of/3, which may be under H's control, or under the control ofexternal laws, as in(4) 7b hang the border, begin at the least conspicuous corner.
The work will go muchfaster if you have someone hold the folded section while you apply the border to thewall.
Take care not to drip paste onto the wall.S expects H not to realize that there are different ways of performing the action hangingthe border, some of which result in the side effect of dripping paste on the wall; andtherefore S alerts H to take steps in order to prevent hat from happening.13Some further evidence that S's expectations on H's possible choices affect the use of a DONTversus a ncg-TC imperative is provided by the infelicitousness of a- - -  really occurring!
- -DONT imperative:(5) # If you must replace a tile, first cut a~vund the edges with a circular saw.
Set the bladeto the depth of the tile and don' t  damage adjoining tiles.The previous example is not felicitous because, in the context of an assembly task, damage isltot a choice that I\[ has at his disposal, but rather, it is a side effect that may derive fromcertain choices in executing cut edges with a saw: therefore neg-TCwould be more appropriatethan DONT.3'0 conclude, I have presented evidence that the possible choices that S believes H has withrespect o acting affect S's communicative intentions.
Further work is needed to identify otherfactors underlying S's communicative intentions; as far as negative imperatives are concerned, Ihave started oing work on other components hat come into play, such as the lexical semanticsof the negated action \[Di 93\].References\[Di 92\] Barbara Di Eugenio.
