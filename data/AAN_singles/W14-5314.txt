In the first level, the text is classified into a languagegroup using a simple token-based maxent classifier.
At the second level, a group-specific maxentclassifier is applied to classify the text as one of the languages or varieties within the previouslyidentified group.
For each group of languages, the classifier uses a different kind and combinationof knowledge-poor features: token or character n-grams and ?white lists?
of tokens.
Features wereselected according to the results of applying ten-fold cross-validation over the training dataset.The system presented in this article1has been ranked second in the Discriminating Similar Lan-guage (DSL) shared task co-located within the VarDial Workshop at COLING 2014 (Zampieriet al., 2014).1 IntroductionLanguage identification (LI) can be defined as the task of determining the language of a written text.LI is also a cross-cutting technology supporting many other text analysis tasks: sentiment analysis,political tendency or topic classification.
There are some interesting problems around written languageidentification that have attracted some attention recently, as native language identification (NLI, Tetreaultet al., 2013), the identification of the country of origin or the discrimination between similar or closelyrelated languages (DSL, Tiedemann and Ljube?si?c, 2012).LI has reached a great success in discriminating between languages with unique character sets and lan-guages belonging to different language groups or typologically distant.
However, according to Zampieri(2013), multilingualism, noisy or non-standard features in text and discrimination between similar lan-guages, varieties or dialects remain as the major known bottlenecks in language identification.
For thisreason, DSL can be considered as a sub-task in language identification.
Interestingly enough, LI seemsto work well with what Kloss (1967) called abstandsprache or language by distance (because Basqueis an isolate, it is generally regarded as a distant language) but fails in dealing with ausbausprache orlanguage by development (a standard variety together with all varieties heteronomous with respect to it,e.
g. Basque Batua koin?e and the various vernacular dialects).Mass media, educational centres, administrations and communications favour standard languages in-stead of other varieties.
Standard varieties of languages are then seen by sociolinguists and dialectologistsas political and cultural constructs (Trudgill, 2004).
However, languages and varieties are not just sys-tems for communication between individuals, they are also used by groups and they are a crucial partof their identity and culture.
Language variation is systematic, both inter- and intra-personal.
It can berelated to political, social, geographical, situational, communicative or instrumental factors.
Variationwithin a language can be found at different levels: alphabet, orthography (diacritics), word structure(syllable composition, morphology), lexical choice or even syntax.
Similar or closely related languagesoften reflect a common origin and are members of a dialect continuum (Bloomfield, 1935).1We wish to thank an anonimous reviewer for her valuable comments and suggestions.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

While character-based methods provide a means to distinguish between differ-ent languages on the basis of coarse-grained statistics on n-grams, it seems that discriminating betweensimilar languages needs more fine-grained distinctions not always reflected by n-gram character distribu-tions.
According to Tiedemann and Ljube?si?c (2012), character-based n-gram methods fail for languageswith a high lexical overlap, since the more shared words between two languages, the more similar willtheir n-gram character frequency profiles be.Group Model Lang/Var Precision Recall F1-scoreA C 1-5bs 0.930 0.889 0.909hr 0.924 0.941 0.932sr 0.929 0.953 0.941B L 1id 0.988 0.994 0.991my 0.994 0.988 0.991C T 1-2cz 1.000 0.999 0.999sk 0.999 1.000 0.999D T 1-2pt-BR 0.933 0.964 0.948pt-PT 0.963 0.930 0.946E T 1-2es-AR 0.942 0.816 0.874es-ES 0.837 0.949 0.890F L 1en-GB 0.959 0.411 0.575en-US 0.643 0.932 0.761Overall without F 0.949 0.947 0.947Overall 0.926 0.932 0.928Table 1: Macro-averaged Precision, Recall and F1-score on the DSL training dataset resulting from 10-fold cross-validation using the best model for each group of languages o varieties.
Model has a lettercode indicating the kind of elements considered: C (characters), T (tokens), L (tokens from the list of the10,000 most frequent tokens), and a number indicating how many consecutive elements have been takenin a feature: 1 (unigrams), 1-2 (unigrams and bigrams), 1-5 (sequences of length one to five).2 Previous ApproachesAlthough focused on formal languages, Gold (1967) is usually credited as the first to attempt compu-tational language identification.
In particular, two common LI approaches, namely n-gram languagemodels and white (or black) lists, echo Gold?s information presentation methods.
In the 1990s, languageidentification was formulated as a sub-task of text categorization and varied approaches were explored.Beesley (1988) pioneered the use of character n-grams models, which were also used by Dunning (1994)and Cavnar and Trenkle (1994).
Grefenstette (1995) compared this approach to Ingle (1978), based onthe frequency of short words.
The interested reader is referred to Zampieri (2013) for a review of somestatistical and machine learning proposals and to both Baldwin and Lui (2010) and Lui and Baldwin(2011) for an overview of some linguistically motivated models.As Baldwin and Lui (2010) or Tiedemann and Ljube?si?c (2012) point out, language identification iserroneously considered an easy and solved problem2, in part because of some general purpose systemsbeing available, notably TextCat3, Xerox Language Identifier4and, more recently, langid.py (Luiand Baldwin, 2012).
While it is true that it is possible to obtain brilliant results for a small number oflanguages (Baldwin and Lui, 2010) or typologically distant languages (Zampieri et al., 2013), accuratelydiscriminating among closely related languages or varieties of the same language has been repeatedlyreported as a bottleneck for language identification systems, in particular for those based on n-grams.2See McNamee (2005) eloquent title.3http://odur.let.rug.nl/vannoord/TextCat4http://open.xerox.com/Services/LanguageIdentifier121Back in 2004, Padr?o and Padr?o concluded that ?since the tested systems tend to fail when distinguishingsimilar languages (e.g.
Spanish and Catalan), further research could be done to solve these cases.
?Martins and Silva (2005) report similar difficulties in discriminating among European and BrazilianPortuguese.
Ranaivo-Malanc?on (2006) motivates her work on the unsatisfactory performance of (then)available language identifiers when dealing with close languages such as Malay and Indonesian.
Ljube?si?cet al.
(2007) do not even attempt to distinguish Bosnian from Croatian when developing a Croatianidentifier because of their closeness.
Trieschnigg et al.
(2012) come as an exception as they reportsatisfactory results in identifying sixteen varieties of Dutch with TextCat.Ranaivo-Malanc?on (2006) presents a cascaded language identifier for Malay and Indonesian.
It firstdistinguishes Malay or Indonesian from other four European languages using trigrams extracted fromthe most frequent words from each language.
Texts classified as Malay or Indonesian are subsequentlyscanned for some linguistic features (format of numbers and exclusive words), yielding a more preciseperformance than TextCat.Ljube?si?c et al.
(2007) also propose a cascaded identifier that relies on ?black lists?
to discard non-Balkan languages and a second order Markov model on n-grams to discriminate among them, aug-mented with a ?black list?
component that raises accuracy up to 0.99 when dealing with the most difficultpair (Croatian and Serbian).
This work is followed up in Tiedemann and Ljube?si?c (2012) where 9%of improvement over standard approaches is reported and where support for Bosnian discrimination isincluded.Huang and Lee (2008) use a bag of the most frequent words to build a voting identifier for three Chi-nese varieties with a top accuracy of 0.929.
More recently, Zampieri (2013) compares the performanceof n-gram based models to machine learning methods using bag of words when discriminating similarlanguages and varieties obtaining comparable performance with both approaches.Grouin et al.
(2010) present the shared task DEFT 2010.
Participants were challenged to identifythe decade, country (France and Canada) and newspaper for a set of journalistic texts.
As far as thecountry labeling is concerned, they report an upper 0.964 F1-measure and an average of 0.767.
Verybrief descriptions of the systems are also offered.Zampieri and Gebre (2012) present a log-likelihood estimation method for language models built onorthographical (character n-grams), lexical (word unigrams) and lexico-syntactic (word bigrams) fea-tures.
They report a 0.998 accuracy distinguishing European and Brazilian Portuguese with a languagemodel based on character 4-grams.
This approach is adapted in Zampieri et al.
(2013) to deal with Span-ish varieties, where the role of knowledge-rich features (POS tags) is also explored.
They report a 0.99accuracy when binarily distinguishing Argentinean and Mexican Spanish with single words or bigrams.Trieschnigg et al.
(2012) compare the performance of TextCat to the nearest neighbour and nearestprototype in combination with a cosine distance when distinguishing among sixteen varieties of Dutch.They report a micro-average F1-score of 0.799 (and a macro-average F1-score of 0.527) with a topF1-score of 0.987 when dealing with Frisian.Lui and Cook (2013) report experiments with different classifiers to map English documents to theircountry of origin.
An SVM classifier with bag of words is top ranked with a macro-average 0.911 F1-score in a cross-domain setting and 0.975 in an in-domain setting.All these previous works (with the sole exception of Trieschnigg et al.
(2012), where a general purposeLI system yields a satisfactory performance) agree in the specificity of DSL regarding LI.
Maybe becauseof that, two level approaches are not uncommon.
Features used to discriminate seem to be language-group specific, altough word rather than character features seem to perform better (Zampieri and Gebre(2012) report best results for character 4-grams, however, given that European and Brazilian Portuguesedo not completely share ortography).3 Maximum Entropy Models and Feature EngineeringMaximum Entropy modelling is a general purpose machine learning framework that has proven to behighly expressive and powerful in many areas.
Maximum Entropy (maxent) was first introduced intonatural language processing by Berger et al.
(1996) and Della Pietra et al.
(1997).
Since its introduction,122Maximum Entropy techniques and the more general framework of Random Fields have been appliedextensively to natural language processing problems, where maxent classifiers are commonly used as analternative to Na?
?ve Bayes classifiers.
In maxent modelling, the probability that an example x is in aclass c is estimated from its bag of words (or n-grams) as:p(c|x) =1Zexp?y?bow(x)N?i=1wci?
fi(c, y)where fi(c, y) are indicator functions, wciis the weight assigned to feature i in class c, and Z is anormalization factor.
Features are modelled by indicator functions fi(c, y), which are evaluated to onewhen the feature i for a particular class c is true for a word y and zero otherwise.
The following is anexample of an indicator function modelling the presence of a particular word in a class:f1(c, y) ={1, c = en-GB ?
y = ?colour?0, otherwiseThe class assigned to an example x is the most probable one:c?
= argmaxc?Cp(c|x)The maxent classifiers are implemented with the toolkit of Zhang Le (2004), and the parameters of themodel are estimated using Generalized Iterative Scaling (Darroch and Ratcli, 1972).Having chosen a closed approach to the DSL shared task, no other resources than the text samplesgiven as training and development datasets have been used in features design.
In this knowledge-poorapproach to the problem, the maxent classifier has been trained with token and character n-gram features.Character-based features are obtained with a simple character tokenizer.
However, for token-based fea-tures, texts are tokenized using an orthographic tokenizer which splits punctuation from words.
Severalbags of features have been considered during the experiments: single tokens (T1), single words from thelist of the 10,000 most frequent tokens (L1), token bigrams (T2), and n-grams of character sequences oflength from one to five (C1-5).
We will also refer to the lists of the 10,000 most frequent words as ?whitelist?, which have a complementary role to the ?black lists?
of Tiedemann and Ljube?si?c (2012).To determine which features are best suited to each group, we measured their performance using ten-fold cross-validation on the training dataset and using the development dataset for testing.
For group A,best results were obtained using bag of features consisting of variable length character n-grams rangingfrom one to five (C1-5).
On group B, token bigrams (T2) performed slightly better in the developmentset than in the training set than the ?white list?
of tokens (L1), which seems to indicate a better general-isation of the former on unseen examples.
Results for group C were similar for all features considered.Regarding groups D and E, token-based features got similar results, with slightly better results for tokenbigrams.
Finally, for English (group F) results were generally bad, reaching the ?white list?
the betterresults.
Group F is known to contain more than a few misclassifications due to news cross citing be-tween American and British press.
Results for each group?s best model using ten-fold cross-validationon the training dataset are shown in Table 1.
All figures have been macro averaged, i.e., they have beencomputed averaging the ten folds.Because best results for each group are obtained with different feature sets, a new classifier is in-troduced.
This classifier determines the language/variety group of each example before applying itsparticular group classifier.
As can be seen in Table 2, the degree of token overlap between languages andvarieties of different groups is rather low compared with the degree of overlap within the same group.Using only tokens, total accuracy is reached on the training dataset using cross validation.
A classifierapplying several classifiers in the way we propose is known as a hierarchical two-level classifier.4 Evaluation and Error AnalysisHaving as a goal to assess the performance of the hierarchical maxent classifier with the DSL taskdataset, models were trained using all the examples provided in the training and development datasets.123bs hr sr id my sk cz pt-BR pt-PT es-AR es-ES en-GB en-USbs 35.51 31.29 2.25 2.05 2.09 1.95 1.91 2.00 1.92 1.99 2.09 2.10hr 41.18 2.47 2.21 2.15 2.04 2.08 2.20 2.12 2.16 2.42 2.39sr 2.06 1.74 1.95 1.79 1.63 1.72 1.69 1.69 1.68 1.68id 19.02 2.36 2.47 4.00 4.14 4.35 4.21 6.81 6.74my 1.91 2.00 3.43 3.61 3.75 3.52 6.40 6.23sk 9.45 2.12 2.15 2.20 2.22 2.55 2.56cz 2.18 2.25 2.24 2.27 2.73 2.70pt-BR 29.17 12.04 11.63 4.62 4.60pt-PT 12.14 12.50 4.92 4.94es-AR 30.91 5.52 5.52es-ES 4.89 4.90en-GB 32.76en-USTable 2: Lexical overlap between pairs of languages as a percentage.

Theoverall result without group F is similar: an F1-score of 0.947 for maxent and 0.942 for Na?

Tiedemann and Ljube?si?c(2012) avoid biases towards topic and domain by experimenting with parallel texts reaching an overallaccuracy of 90.3% for group A (br, hr, sr) using a ?black list?
classifier and comparing its results with aNa?
?ve Bayes approach.
They found that the ?black list?
classifier generalise better than the Na?
?ve Bayesapproach when moving from parallel to comparable corpora, since the former classifier is based on moreinformative features than the later.Results of ten-fold cross-validation on the training dataset for different feature settings for group E(Spanish) were consistent with those of Zampieri et al.

Given that datasets are not identical, it is difficult to draw any conclusionfrom the 1.2% difference in accuracy between DSLRAE and Zampieri et al.
(2013).
Manual inspectionof misclassified news suggests some textual properties that are specially challenging: a) high density offoreign proper names (Russian, Baby, Pony, Jack, .
.
. )
may dilute the evidence provided by vernacularwords; b) conversely, low density of features specific to any variant (such as place or family names5,demonyms, lexical choices) may be insufficient to drive the text to the right class; this is also the case ofsome perfectly neutral sentences where a trained linguist could not spot any clue about their origin; c)certain syntactical idiosyncrasies (for example Argentinian idioms la pasas bien, tal como muchas veces,en exceso de) are not captured by bigrams; d) there are instances of cross-information, e. g., Argentiniannews about Spain and vice versa where maybe more of a topic rather than a variety is being detected(e. g., news about Urdangar?
?n or Fern?andez de Kirchner); e) there are some typos and misspellings(carabanas, dosco) whose role remains unclear; e) finally, there is at least one text misclassified in thegold standard: it is labeled as Argentinian but it was written by the Spanish EFE news agency.
Some ofthese difficulties cross-cut all language groups and are not specific to Spanish but rather to DSL as a task.In contrast to what Zampieri and Gebre (2012) found, ten-fold cross-validation on the training datasetfor different feature settings on the DSL dataset did not find character n-grams to outperform word n-grams for group D (Portuguese).
It could be hypothesized that they used a unique source (newspaper)for each variety and therefore rigid editorial conventions could be at play; moreover, the collections were5Zampieri and Gebre (2012) highlight the importance of proper nouns when using word n-grams.125three years distant, so topic consistency could also be compromised6.
Manual inspection of mislabeledsentences shows some already known categories: evidence diluted by foreign words (Red Brick Ware-house, M?esz?aros, Fat Duck), poor evidence (Valongo, Sao Paulo) or cross-information (TAP, Bras?
?lia).There is, however, a Portuguese-specific issue: some texts obey the 1990 Orthographic Agreement7which blurs the orthographic distinctions regarding diacritics or consonant clusters; in fact, one sentencecontains words following both standards (perspectiva and reproduc??ao).
It remains unexplained whyword bigrams did not capture the Brazilian preference for passive voice (foram rebaixados), auxiliary +gerund chunks (estamos utilizando) or clitic dropping (lembro).Despite findings by Tiedemann and Ljube?si?c (2012), character n-grams performed better during ten-fold cross-validation on the training dataset for different feature settings on the DSL dataset for group A(Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian).
Misclassified sentences involve failing to capture adapted place names(Belgiji,?Svedskoj) or derivational choices (organiziranog).Results of ten-fold cross-validation on the training dataset for different feature settings for group B(Indonesian and Malay) top ranked word unigrams.
Ranaivo-Malanc?on (2006) uses number formattingand exclusive word lists.
It can be hypothesized that lexical overlap is low (see Table 2) and/or frequencydistributions are dissimilar thus allowing word unigrams to perform as well as ?white lists?.Languages of group C (Czech and Slovak) are dissimilar both orthographically and lexically.
Thesedissimilarities are surprisingly well captured by the top 10,000 most frequent words.5 Conclusions and Future WorkIn this paper, we have shown that a hierarchical classifier is well suited to discriminate among differentlanguage groups and languages or varieties therein.
Different features are shown to better suit typologicaltraits of supported languages.
A comparison to previous approaches is provided, when available.In a multilingual setting, the effect of adding Galician to group D could be investigated.
Focusing onSpanish language, we plan to geographically expand the classifier to deal with all national varieties, amuch harder task as both Baldwin and Lui (2010) and Zampieri et al.
(2013) remark.
Moreover, theclassifier could be used, as Tiedemann and Ljube?si?c (2012) suggest, to learn varieties discriminators tolabel texts beyond national classes (e.g.
both Caribbean and Andean Spanish cross-cut national bordersand, conversely, nations involved are known not to be dialectally uniform).
Given that error analysisshowed that word bigrams fail to capture certain syntactical idiosyncrasies, a model with longer n-gramsand/or knowledge-richer features such as POS sequences could also be explored, although Zampieri et al.
(2013) report lower performance than knowledge-poor features.
Finally, classification techniques such asthose described in Gyawali et al.
(2013) may be used to discard translations when building monolingual,vernacular corpora.A diachronic expansion, such as Trieschnigg et al.
(2012), is also in mind.
Medieval Castilian coex-isted with other Romance varieties such as Leonese or Aragonese whose features permeated Castiliantexts.
Researchers are in need of a tool to properly classify diachronic texts to accurately describe olderstages of Spanish.
Following the suggestion of Tiedemann and Ljube?si?c (2012), we envisage the use ofparallel texts such as versions of the Bible from different areas to learn the differences among varieties.ReferencesTimothy Baldwin and Marco Lui.
