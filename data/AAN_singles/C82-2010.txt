Because of  thes ta ts  of  the ar t  in  Computat ional  Lin&qaist$cs, however, thel in~qa is t i c  problems turn  out to  be the major  draw bask inth i s  f ie ld  o f  sc ient i f i c  endeavor .
That i s  the  reason  why thepaper fo r  the greater  part  i s  devoted to the descr ip t ion  of  anew model fo r  automated phonemizat ion.
This model i s  app l iedto  Dutch.
The model was developed fo r  words on ly .
Thus, theread ing  manhins as i t  s tands now i s  ab le  to pronounce a ser ieso f  words eThere fore ,  the texts  read in to  the computer are  t reatedas a ser ies  of  s ing le  words by the read ing  machine.

Thecomputer program FONGRAF i s  ab le  to perform a t ranscr ip t iono f  wr i t ten  text  in to  the phonematic foxiest accord ing  to  thepr inc ip les  of  phonematic t ransor?pt ion .
The paper fooueses  onthe  des ign  of  the prepare  and enswers quest ions  concern ing  there la t ion  between the  techn ica l  par t  ( implamentat ion)  and thel ingu is t i c  cons iderat ions  behind the  computer progj~em.I t  i s  argued that  in  the past  computer programs per form-ing  th i s  l ingu is t i c  task  were pr inc ipa l ly  des igned from the- 46 -implementat ion  po int  of  v iew.
This has led  to computer pro -grams wi~h a s t rong  ad hoc kind of problem so lv ing  part  in  i t .There fore , these  computer prod, rams turn  out to be not adaptab letO new situations and unforeseen mistakes.ln this paper it isargued that for the solution of linguistic problems of thiskind a pat tern  mato~-tng computer program has to be deve loped.I t  should go without say ing that  a computer des igned fo rl in6~is t io  purposes should be f i rmly  based on the l ingu is t i canalysis of the task.
As far as the search for regularities inthe phonet ic  in terpreta t ion  of wr i t ten  text  i s  concerned weused the phono log ica l  theory  as an important  a id .
The phono-log ica l  descr ip t ion  of  the Dutch language was used as the mostimportant  source  fo r  the  de f in i t ion  of  the pat tern  marcher inthe computer program FONGRAP.
Many of the observed regularit-ies regarding the Dutch phoneme distribution and phonologloalru les  concern ing the phonet ic  in terpreta t ion  of the phono log ic -a l  forms of  Dutch morphemes are par t i cu la r ly  use fu l  to  ourproblem in  that  they s ta te  the surroundings  which a f fec t  apar t i cu la r  phoneme.
For ins tance  the ass imi la t ion  ru le  that  aconsonant becomes vo ice less  or  vo iced  accord ing  to the "vo ice"of  the fo l low ing  consonant.
This k ind of  ru les  app l ies  even insurroundings where the sy l lab le  boundar ies  are  invo lved .
Thisi s  the reason why we cons ider  the app l i ca t ion  of  hyphenat ionprograms to be out of  p lace  as fa r  as the so lu t ion  of  thephonemat izat ion  problem for  Dutch words i s  concerned,  This a l soi s  the main reason  why we developed a pat tern  matching comput-er  program.
A fu r ther  advantage of the pat tern  matching pro -gram i s  that  i t  i s  easy to implement "new" regu lar i t ies .
Withthe not ion  "new" regu lar i t ies  we re fer  to  ru les  and regu lar i t -i es  not descr ibed  b~ normal phonology.
Those regu lar i t ieso f ten  are caused by the fac t  that  a computer i s  too " l i te ra l " .Nat ive  speakers  w i l l ,  e .g .

Thus, one has to des ign  means to implem-- 47  -ent th i s  knoWledge.
This i s  done by the de f in i t ion  of  pat te rns .In  the paper we shor t ly  re fe r  to  the eo lu t?on  of  prcnunc?at?on8rab id i ty  caused by semant ic  reasonm.
