An application ofthis system for the assessment of lan-guage understanding and production isdescribed, following a child longitudi-nally, comparing expected productionwith observed production.1 IntroductionWe present an application of a phonological-prosodic algorithm which converts Brazilian Por-tuguese graphemes to phonological symbols.
Fora better understanding, a brief report about theorigin of the algorithm, altogether with sometheoretical comments are presented, before thecase study of the phonological processes foundin the speech samples of a child.
Sessions wererecorded, until the complete acquisition of allPortuguese phonemes by the child, which oc-curred in the fifth session.In 2008, we created the first version of a pho-nological-prosodic algorithm for Brazilian Por-tuguese.
Actually, it is the functional algorithmof the grapheme to phoneme converter Nhenh?m(Vasil?vski, 2008, 2012a, 2012b).
It has all writ-ten Portuguese spelling rules, and also the entirePortuguese prosodic system.
When that algo-rithm was built, we kept in mind its usefulness todifferent fields deeply related to phonology, suchas speech therapy, allowing the study of childrenphonological disorders, and language acquisition.We focus here on its application to languageacquisition, allowing the study of children pho-nological acquisition processes.
Hence, our ob-jective is to show the phonological-prosodic al-gorithm usefulness to language survey, from apractical point of view, by showing the processinvolved in the last stages of the acquisition ofPortuguese phonology.For a better understanding of the applicationand of the case study, the paper starts with sometheory on phonological acquisition, then, someaspects of Brazilian Portuguese acquisition arepresented.2 Phonological DevelopmentStudies of first language acquisition tend to sup-port the view that the ability for language is in-nate in healthy human beings, and that its ap-pearance can be predicted as part of the normaldevelopment of any child, given the right envi-ronment (Beaken, 1971).The greatest expansion of the phonologicalsystem is observed from 1 year and six monthsold up to 4 years old, when there is an increase ofthe phonetic inventory of most complex syllablestructures and, therefore, a period characterizedby the occurrence of omissions, substitutions, aswell as other phonological processes (Wertzner,2004).A phonological process is a mental operationthat applies in speech to substitute, for a class ofsounds or sound sequences presenting a specificcommon difficulty to the speech capacity of theindividual, an alternative class identical but lack-ing the difficult property (Stampe, 1973).It is worth remembering that, at the richeststage of normal language development (1 yearand a half to 4 years old, as said), inappropriatesound gestures are expected phonological proc-esses that relate to children?s adaptations, untilthey automate the adult speech patterns.
Thus,the phonological processes ?
that are natural andinborn ?
guide the facilitation of complex vocal3gestures and their planning, until children reachthe adult performance.Moreover, the early-acquired competence isfiltered through an increasing number of phono-logical transformations to produce, finally, a ma-ture performance.
Although the mature phonemicsystem is acquired at an early stage, articulationmay not be completely mature until after 7 years.Even though most children can be said to havemastered the complete set of potential phonemicoppositions of adult language by the age of 4years ?
in other words, their phonological com-petence is established ?
yet, in adult terms, theirperformance falls short of their competence, inthat they are unable to produce many of the ges-tures of mature articulation of the phonemes.Development after this stage takes place in thematuring of articulation, and in the acquisition ofthe complex transformations which operate onthe basic acquired competence, to produce formsof speech similar to those heard from maturespeakers (Beaken, 1971).2.1 Some Aspects of Brazilian PortuguesePhonological AcquisitionRegarding phonemes, Brazilian Portuguese has21 consonants (/p/, /b/, /f/, /v/, /m/, /n/, /t/, /d/, /s/,/z/, /l/, /?/, /r/, /?/, /?/, /?/, /?/, /k/, /g/, and the ar-chiphonemes |R|, |S|), and 14 vowels (/a/, /e/, /?/,/i/, /o/, /?/, /u/, /j/, /w/, /?/, /?/, /?/, /?/, /?/) (Scliar-Cabral, 2003a; C?mara Jr., 1986, 1977; Va-sil?vski, 2012a).Lateral liquid phonemes /l/ and /?/ and non-lateral liquid /r/ and /?/ are the latest to be ac-quired in Brazilian Portuguese.
Furthermore,such acquisition is marked by intense use of di-versified phonological processes.
What perhapsjustifies this late acquisition, in Brazilian Portu-guese as well as in other systems, is that thisclass is very complex, both in articulation andphonological aspects (Lamprecht, 2004).Within this group of sounds, lateral phonemesare acquired before the non-lateral ones.
The firstlateral phoneme to be stabilized by children is /l/,which is subdued before the emergence of thefirst non-lateral liquid phoneme /?/.
This occurswith the phonemes /?/ ?
graphically lh ?
and /r/,being the first acquired before the second (Her-nandorena and Lamprecht, 1997).
In Portuguese,the phoneme /r/ occurs: 1) forming a syllablewith an oral or nasal vowel (simple onset); 2) insecond position of inseparable consonant clus-ters, preceding oral or nasal vowel (complex on-set); and 3) in syllable ending (coda, when it isthe archiphoneme |R|).
See Tab.1 for examples.In most cases, the acquisition of the phoneme/r/ happens initially in the position of simple on-set (by 4 years old) and then in the position ofcomplex onset (by 5 years old), the acquisition ofthe phoneme /r/ in coda position (that is, |R|) oc-curs by 4 years old (Lamprecht, 2004) either.Another linguistic phenomenon to be takeninto account is diphthongization.
It happenswhen one vowel breaks into two segments,where the first one matches the original voweland the second (/j/ or /w/) is harmonic with thenature of the triggering vowel.
In Brazilian Por-tuguese, one of the conditions when diphthongi-zation occurs, and that matters here, is thus de-fined: a stressed vowel, followed by a devoicedalveolar fricative [s], in the ending syllable of aword, becomes diphthongized by the addition ofa second segment, an [i] (Cagliari, 2002).
Sincediphthongization is a strengthening process, itoccurs preferentially with strong vowels, and, inRomance languages, /a/ is the strongest vowel,and /i/, the weakest (Foley, 1977).
The semivow-els of stressed syllables can be either produced ornot in speech, both options belonging to Portu-guese language system (Vasil?vski, 2012a).From the linguistic point of view, diphthongiza-tion is strongly related to the geographical dia-lectal variation (Leiria, 2000).3 A Program for Helping LanguageAcquisition ResearchBy using Nhenh?m phonological-prosodic algo-rithm, we built Nhenh?m Fonoaud ?
NhFonoaud?, an application for assisting speech therapy,and so language acquisition.
We began coveringjust one phonological process, called ?unvoiced-ness?
: a substitution of a voiced sound for anunvoiced one (e.g.
/b/ ?
/p/) (Blasi and Va-sil?vski, 2011).
Soon, we realized that the phono-logical-prosodic algorithm could cover muchmore.One of the motivations for creating such asystem is that many Brazilian language acquisi-tion researchers record their collected data usingorthographic representation.
As a result, thosetranscriptions are idiosyncratic and cannot beproperly generalized, since they lack patterns.Data must be recorded in a phonologic-phoneticformat, essential for these studies, since they ad-dress phonological processes.According to researchers and speech thera-pists, there is no similar work in Brazilian Portu-guese.
Probably, there are similar initiatives for4other languages, and we expect to make com-parisons soon.3.1 The decoder Nhenh?m Phonological-prosodic AlgorithmNhenh?m (/??.???
?/) is a computational programthat decodes Brazilian?s official writing systeminto phonological symbols and marks prosody(Vasil?vski, 2008, 2012a).
In 2010, we aug-mented its main algorithm, so the system becameable of providing the phonological syllabic divi-sion and the spelling syllabic division, with atleast 99% of accuracy (see Vasil?vski, 2012a,2012b for more details).
Then we developed anautomatic syllable parsing (Vasil?vski, 2010).In 2012, we made some adjustments regardingmorphology, and solved the unpredictable situa-tions brought, for example, by the prefix ?trans-?that can be either decoded as /tr?z/ or /tr?s/, inconsequence of resyllabification (see Vasil?vski,2012a).
NhFonoaud benefits of all improvementsobtained by the basic algorithm.3.2 Nhenh?m FonoaudThe application of Nhenh?m phonological-prosodic algorithm to language acquisition andspeech therapy has been presented (Blasi andVasil?vski, 2011, Vasil?vski, 2012a, 2012b), butthis is the first time that a case study is discussed.The first major challenge of working withphonemic transcription is the consistency of data.Different research questions require differentlevels of representation (Albert et al., 2013).
Inthis regard, relying on an orthographic represen-tation of speech, when dealing with languageacquisition, does not make sense.The program supports the analysis of proc-esses that occur in the child?s phonological sys-tem, through the automatic phonological tran-scription simultaneously to samples of the childspeech recording.
Thus, data relies on a phone-mic representation of speech, automatically doneby the algorithm, through Nhenh?m Fonoaud.NhFonoaud is designed for dealing with pho-nological tests, using words wittingly grouped toanalyze specific aspects of speech and phenom-ena involved in its development.
One of the toolsof the program was the tests battery called Re-ception and Production of Spoken Language As-sessment (Scliar-Cabral, 2003b).
These testswere elaborated for assessing overt symptoms ofspoken language reception and production prob-lems.
The first step is assessing phonetic featuresperception, namely, the ability of distinguishingminimal pairs, what means distinguishing Brazil-ian Portuguese words.The battery is composed by 81 pictures thatrepresent specific words in Portuguese.
The pic-tures are grouped into cards of six elements each.There are 15 cards, and some pictures appear inmore than one.
Each card is assembled to addressthe perception and production of one specificphonetic feature: 1) /v/-/f/, /p/-/b/, /t/-/d/; 2) /k/-/g/, /?/-/?/, /s/-/z/; 3) /m/-/n/, /t/-/d/, /s/-/f/; 4) /b/-/g/, /f/-/r/, /k/-/p/; 5) /t/-/k/, |R|-/s/, /l/-/?/; 6) /t/-/s/, /k/-|R|, /p/-/f/; 7) /d/-/t/, /t/-/r/, /d/-/s/; 8) /m/-/b/, /n/-/r/, /z/-/n/; 9) /?/-/?/, /d/-/n/, /n/-/l/; 10) /r/-/l/ (in three different contexts); 11) /?/-/?/, /i/-/u/,/e/-/o/; 12) /i/-/e/, /?/-/?/, /u/-/o/; 13) /e(j)/-/?/, /o/-/?/, /?/-/o(w)/; 14) /?/-/a/, /m/-/b/ (in two differentcontexts)/; 15) /?/-/e/, /o/-/?/, /a/-/?/.In the reception battery, the speech therapist,behind the child, says the word and the childmust point to one of the six pictures in each card.In the production battery, the speech therapistpoints to one of the six pictures in each card andthe child must label it.While the child labels the picture, the re-searcher can edit the canonical transcription pro-vided by the program to match the child?s pro-duction.
For example, writing the lateral pho-neme, when the child produces it, instead of thevibrating one.In principle, four situations may happen dur-ing the assessment (Fig.1): the child does notrecognize the  picture  (NR); the  child  gives  theFigure 1.

Des-vio); the child translates the word into his/hersociolinguistic variety (not deviation ?
S?cio).NhFonoaud stores the records and comparesthem with the transcription expected, for generat-ing reports.
Hence, it is possible to build a cor-pus, to retrieve it, grouping it according to date,situation, child?s age, type of card (test); then itis possible the conversion into numbers, usingdifferent formats, comparing the phonologicaltranscription and the correspondent audio, andthe recorded sessions.
Therefore, it facilitateschild?s progress monitoring.In spite of working with words, NhFonoaudcan be adjusted to work with bigger texts,formed by many sentences.
For the purpose ofassessing the child phonemic system, using min-imal pairs and small sentences is enough.3.3 Testing Nhenh?m FonoaudThe data analysis that we now present refers to achild in a clear process of language acquisition.It is based on oral emissions of a girl that we willcall In?s.
The 15 cards (Scliar-Cabral, 2003b)were applied, covering all the Brazilian Portu-guese phonemes.
Five sessions were recorded,starting when In?s was 2 years, 11 months, and 8days; until she was 3 years, 8 months and 29days.In?s was born in Curitiba, Brazil, of Brazilianparents.
She was not considered to have signifi-cant hearing loss.
The child had developed somecomputer skills.
Data was collected by her par-ents, by showing her the cards at the computer,during a daily conversation.
In?s had alreadycontact with the pictures, and had learned somenames that were not part of her daily life.
Thesessions were recorded by using the audio re-sources of the same computer, and the recordswere clear enough to be used in this study.3.3.1 Testing resultsThe results reveal the phonological processesused by In?s.
Four were observed in her emis-sions: two of substitution, one of deletion, andone of adding.
From the reports generated byNhenh?m Fonoaud, we created Tab 1.So, at the age of 2y11m8d, three phonologicalprocesses relate to a single phoneme of hermother tongue, the non-lateral, vibrating /r/, andanother one to diphthongization.
Thus, In?s isonly unable to produce the most complex Portu-guese phoneme, in anyone of the three cases inwhich it occurs.
The first session reveals that thechild is able to produce all the vowels (14) of hermother tongue and 20 consonantal phonemesamong the 21 of Brazilian Portuguese.
Nochanges are observed for about 4 months, butthis is expected, since progress in language isEmitted sounds Spelling Meaning Expectedsounds 2y11m8d 3y2m23d 3y6m25d 3y7m24d 3y8m29dporta door /p?

Phonological processes used by In?s.6never regular; it may proceed at a fast rate forsome periods while at others very little seems tobe happening (Beaken, 1971).
Then, the sound /r/is emerging, only in simple onset, and she pro-duces the cluster, but says /tl/ instead of /tr/(3y6m25d).
One month later (3y7m24d), shestarts producing /r/ in coda position and the clus-ter /tr/, with some difficult yet.
The sound /r/ insimple onset is naturally produced.
One moremonth (3y8m29d), and she is able to naturallyproduce /r/ in all the contexts it happens in Por-tuguese, and keeps diphthongization.Regarding diphthongization, it happens whenthe child inserts the semivowel /j/ between avowel and the coda |S|, creating a diphthong.This circumstance advises that the child is ad-justing her speech according to adult speech,since the region where In?s lives is where thisphonological phenomenon occurs most, consid-ering the South of Brazil (Leiria, 2000).
It is atrait of the child?s sociolinguistic variety, de-pendent upon geographic factor, and so shekeeps saying it.Hence, this research found that In?s completedthe acquisition of the phonemes of her nativelanguage at 3 years and 8 months approximately,in normal development.4 Conclusion and OutlooksWe briefly presented a system for dealing withphonological information in Brazilian Portu-guese, and a case study from it, that is, the lon-gitudinal speech recording of a child ?
the girlcalled In?s.
Data allowed to know the lastprocesses involved in the acquisition of thephonemes of her mother tongue.From the preliminary results obtained, it ispossible to conclude that Nhenh?m Fonoaud canbe helpful to language acquisition research.
Nev-ertheless, the usefulness of the phonological pro-sodic algorithm has to be proven, by testing it indifferent situations, such as deviant languageacquisition, speech therapy, and also other re-searches.
This will be our next step.ReferenceAviad Albert, Brian MacWhinney, Bracha Nir, ShulyWintner.
