A remarkable regularity of distribution ofArabic verbal roots in the vocabulary is shown toexist.
Presented results sugsest that similar resulardistributions of semantic units in other languagesmay be found with the help of word formation rulesand vocabulary statistics.
Possible applications inapproaching the problem of "true" multiple meaningin MT are being discussed.The notion of "semantic unit" may be formulated inseveral ways /I/ so that the application of this term makes itsexplicit definition indispensable.
It seems that difficulties indefinin~ it arise from the fact that llke most general terms itshould be related to some deflnlte theory.
At present we do notpossess any sufficiently strong and ~eneral theory of the semanticsof natural languages~ though important preliminary steps in thisdirection have already been made /2/.
For this reason most seman-tic investigations of natural languages still preserve the"artlsanllke" character stressed by LI.Coyoud and all definitionsof the semantlo notions remain rather tentat ive -  as well as allthe more ~eneral conclusions drawn from such investlg~tlons.ThIs~ too~ holds true for the present contrlbution, in which anempirical fact is described and some remarks on its possibleapplications to the problem of the "~rue" multiple meanln~ havebeen made.sSkalmowski  - 2For this paper it seems advisable to hold apart twonotions: that of the "concept" and that of the "semantic uz~it".Given a generat ive  descr lpt ional  device G z~rammar/ and a pro-Jective system of the type proposed by Katz and Fodor S /sem~n-tics/ we can descr ibe a semantic concept in a lan~ua~'e L asa set of n-tuples of symbo ls  from G and S~ ordered or par-t ial ly ordered by the relat ions which def ine the formal rules ofthese systems~ and having a common der ivat ion in S. This broadframe al~ows us to re~,:ard as a oonoe~t e~ery dict ion ..... - , ~ ~u~ er~try -except for the "grammatica l  words" v:hich do not i)ossess any de-r ivations in C - and leaves us a wide mar~in of f reedeou in-~, v oonoelt -systems:: ',viti~ a i,rio~i estab- construot in~ arb_t,at~ '~lished features.In a s imi lar  way we may descr ibe a sei;mntic unitas a set of n-tuples of G-symbols,  G-rules of word formationand S-symbols~ ordered or part ia l ly  ordered by means of rela-tions wI~ich def ine the formal rules of these systems~ and ' ......a common der ivat ion  in  ~ f rom some J - symoo l  un ique!y  re la ted  l j \ [to  some S -symbo l .
Th is  a l lows  us  to  re la te  w i th  t i~e not ion  o fa semantic unit the l inguist ic  not ions of morpheme /or merestrictly: semanteme/  and of "word family"~ defined in terms ofgrammat ica l  der ivat ions.The thessur lc ai?proach to the problem of meaningin fit /s .e .g .3/  pays trlbut to the idea of ordering the symbols?
c~l^ within the conoel~ts~ but at the same time it brings to I~ L~tthe Droblem of mult ip le meaning.
This problem has been muchdiscussed already /s.e.g.4/,  but it is st i l l  far from beingf~ solved in al l  its aspects ~,.eneral!y sl) ~ '~" - .
a~.In,.-, the main d i f f icu l -Skalnmwski - 3ty arises from the fact that the "concept-systems" of lansua~esare not isomorphic and even if we manage to brinS tk, e~u closerto,sether there remains some amount of "looseness" within theconcepts themselves, giving.
rise to the problem of "true" mul-tiple meaning.
The "contextual" multiple ~nea~Jin.~ inay be resolved- in l)rinciple~ at least - by extending the notion of conceptsboth "in the source and i~ the tarfet languages to ,:holt sentencesor even lar&~er utterances) this is allowed by our :' broad:'treatment of this notion, not s!
',eoifyin S the maximal size ofthe n-tu/~les of symbols.
By this extension the inner structureof concepts makes the relations defining the isomorphism of the"concept -systems" more apparent i thus even such cases as theadequate translation of the ~\[ussian ~@M?~eas  the English':ohangin~ /the order of intezration/"and "varying /argument/"are theoretical ly resolvable.
Yet there exist instances w?,erethe extension of concept would have to go beyond limits and toinvolve the whole !un.~fuage: these are c6~ses of :'stylistic'difference in v;hich there are not ai)parent reasons for choosin:ione o.?
the fossible s$,nonyms instead of the ct~\]er but \';ilere t~edifference ia dist inctly felt by competent bil ingual speakers.ri'he !
)z-oblem is important for the translation of literary pieces,especia l ly  i)oetr~:) b$' the \])resent stal\]d of .,iT it is still an;'acade~:\]ic" p~oiJlem, of course~ but it exists after all.
it ~.laybe best i l lustrated by the question whether t~ere are "better;:and '~worse ~T translations of nonsensical expressions~ such as thefamops ';furiously sleel)ing ideas".
Le6ative ans'~'Jer would meanthat every translation is equally sood~ ~,;hioh in turn would i.leanthat o~:ly "meaningful" sentences are translatable~ in that caseISka imowski - 4the i,!T problems would be "enriched" with the whole load of phi-losophioal  quest ions - an embarassing development~ certainly.Vaguely felt d i f ferences between the intr insic"semantic values" of d i f ferent  elements of language have givenrise to the not ions of "size" or "content" of Semantic elements/5/ and several  attempts - both to define these notions and tofurnish models of the under ly ing ~,~eohanism \[~ave been ,,~r~e /p~6/.The m~in assumpt ion - based on observat ions of ,lillis -','asthat there existed a "nat-ral  hierarchy" of concepts in naturallanguages~ forming a tree or at least a latt ice with some de-f inite stat is t ica l  propert ies.The ipresent Daper gives some results of an in-vest':.S,,':'tion undertaken in order to test this hy;?o,-,eses.~Because of the marvelous clarity of the grai-,Imatical structure~rabic has been chosen as a " laboratory exar,\])7~le ~'.

fe ren  s te,,:s c onljIthe number of stem-patterns was considered and further ai<'licab!eword formation rules /substantivisat ions~ adjeot iv isat ions etc./were disregarded this classif ication is a ver~, rough approxi-mation to the h~i~othetical underlying hierarci~.
It ha~ beenassumecL that the number of stem-l~atterns definin,~ a given classal .pro~m~tely viewed as an exponent of the '"oo~Itent ~ or~'semantio value" of the semantic units belongin~ to tkis classand that - if the hypothetical  hierarchy was really based onthis principle - the number of roots with greater s should besmaller than that with smaller s. 3aranov's Arabic-RussianDiotionar~ /7/ has been used for countin& the roots and it hasbeen found that the relation between s /the number of stem--patterns oharacter lz ln~ the given class/ and r /the number ofroots belonging to this class/ was not only inversly proportionalbut also nearly functional and that the distr ibution of roots inthe Arabic vocabulary may be described as a simple functionr/s/ = i'~/As ~ +De +C/~ where \[~ is the sum-total of roots and.

The ideaof interconnections between the syntactic and semantic structuresof language is not new in structural l inguistics /s.9 and 10/and investigations alon~ these lines have already been led inthe domain of computational l inguistics under direction ofP.Garvin /11/.
My suggestions go towards discovering such regularSkalmowski - 7distr ibut ions which would faci l itate the task of f inding morestrict correlations between the synonyms within \[)articular con-cepts on computational basis.
The underlying assumption is thatthe "universes of disoours" in various languages are of aboutthe same "size" /whatever it would mean - but such an assumptionis tacitely made in every translation/~ and that the semanticunits underlying the components of concepts are orderedaocordin~ to their "content"~ so that the problem of "true"multiple meaning in certain oases ;nay be solved by means ofmatching the components of concepts o f  the source and targetlanguages on the basis of their ':semantic value".As an i l lustration let us consider a fev: equivalent....
