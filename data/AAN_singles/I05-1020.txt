This paper presents our recent work on period disambigua-tion, the kernel problem in sentence boundary identification, with themaximum entropy (Maxent) model.
A number of experiments are con-ducted on PTB-II WSJ corpus for the investigation of how contextwindow, feature space and lexical information such as abbreviated andsentence-initial words affect the learning performance.
Such lexical in-formation can be automatically acquired from a training corpus by alearner.
Our experimental results show that extending the feature spaceto integrate these two kinds of lexical information can eliminate 93.52%of the remaining errors from the baseline Maxent model, achieving anF-score of 99.8227%.1 IntroductionSentence identification is an important issue in practical natural language pro-cessing.
It looks simple at first glance since there are a very small number ofpunctuations, namely, period (?.?
), question mark (???
), and exclamation (?!?
),to mark sentence ends in written texts.
However, not all of them are consistentlyused as sentence ends.
In particular, the use of the dot ?.?
is highly ambiguousin English texts.
It can be a full stop, a decimal point, or a dot in an abbreviatedword, a numbering item, an email address or a ULR.
It may be used for otherpurposes too.
Below are a number of examples from PTB-II WSJ Corpus toillustrate its ambiguities.

are rarely ambiguous.
They are seldom usedfor other purposes than exclamation and question marks.

: Whenever a dot shows up in a text token, we need to determine whether ornot it is a true period.
It is a yes-no classification problem that is suitable forvarious kinds of machine learning technology to tackle.Several approaches were developed for sentence splitting.
These approachescan be categorized into three classes: (1) rule-based models consisting of man-ually constructed rules (e.g., in the form of regular expression), supplementedwith abbreviation lists, proper names and other relevant lexical resources, asillustrated in [1]; (2) machine learning algorithms, e.g., decision tree classifiers[11], maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling [10] and neural networks [8], amongmany others; and (3) syntactic methods that utilize syntactic information, e.g.,[6] is based on a POS tagger.
The machine learning approaches are popular, forperiod disambiguation is a typical classification problem for machine learning,and the training data is easily available.Our research reported in this paper explores how context length and featurespace affects the performance of the Maxent model for period disambiguation.The technical details involved in this research are introduced in Section 2, with afocus on feature selection and training algorithm.
Section 3 presents experimentsto show the effectiveness of context length and feature selection on learningperformance.
Section 4 concludes the paper with our findings: putting frequentabbreviated words or sentence-initial words into the feature space significantlyenhances the learning performance, and using a three-word window context givesbetter performance than others in terms of the F-score.
The best combination ofthe two kinds of lexical information achieves an F-score of 99.8227%, eliminating93.5% remaining errors from the baseline Maxent model.2 Feature SelectionThe problem of period disambiguation can be formulated as a statistical classi-fication problem.
Our research is aimed at exploring the effectiveness of Maxentmodel [2,12] tackling this problem when trained with various context length andfeature sets.Maxent model is intended to achieve the most unbiased probabilistic distri-bution on the data set for training.
It is also a nice framework for integratingheterogeneous information into a model for classification purpose.
It has beenpopular in NLP community for various language processing tasks since Bergeret al [2] and Della Pietra et al [3] presenting its theoretical basis and basictraining techniques.
Ratnaparkhi [9] applied it to tackle several NL ambiguityproblems, including sentence boundary detection.
Wallach [14] and Malouf [4]compared the effectiveness of several training algorithms for Maxent model.There are a number of full-fledged implementations of Maxent models avail-able from the Web.
Using the OpenNLP MAXENT package from http://maxent.sourceforge.net/, acknowledged here with gratitude, we are releasedfrom the technical details of its implementation and can concentrate on exam-ining the effectiveness of context length and feature space on period disam-Period Disambiguation with Maxent Model 225biguation.
Basically, our exploration is carried out along the following workingprocedure: (1) prepare a set of training data in terms of the feature space wechoose; (2) train the Maxent model, and test its performance with a set of testingdata; (3) examine the errors in the test outcomes and adjust the feature spacefor the next round of training and testing towards possible improvement.2.1 Context and FeaturesTo identify sentence boundaries, a machine learner needs to learn from the train-ing data the knowledge whether or not a dot is a period in a given context .Classification decision is based on the available contextual information.
A con-text is the few tokens next to the target.
By ?target?
we refer to the ?.?
tobe determined whether or not it is a period, and by ?target word?
(or ?dottedword?)
we refer to the token that carries the dot in question.
The dot dividesthe target word into prefix and suffix, both of which can be empty.
Each dot hasa true or false answer for whether it is a true period in a particular context, asillustrated by the following general format.
[ preceding-words prefix .suffix following-words ] ?
Answer: true/false .
(1)Contextual information comes from all context words surrounding the targetdot, including its prefix and suffix.
However, instead of feeding the above con-textual items to a machine learner as a number of strings for training andtesting, extracting special and specific features from them for the training isexpected to achieve more effective results.
To achieve a learning model as unbi-ased as possible, we try to extract as many features as possible from the con-text words, and let the training algorithm to determine their significance.
Themain cost of using a large feature set is the increase of training time.
However,this may be paid off by giving the learner a better chance to achieve a bettermodel.Table 1.

?WeIsRdot Ending with a dot billions.IsRcomma Ending with a comma Moreover,IsEword An English word streetIsDigit An numeric item 25%, 36IsAllCap Consisting of only capital letters (& dots) WASHINGTONThe feature set for a normal context word that we have developed through sev-eral rounds of experiments along the above working procedure are presented inTable 1.
Basically, we extract from a word all features that we can observe from its226 C. Kit and X. LiuTable 2.

For feature extraction, this set is applied equally, in a principled way, toall context words.
The feature set for both parts of a target word is highly similarto that for a context word, except for a few specific to prefix and/or suffix, as givenin Table 2, of 13 features in total.
The data entry for a given dot, for either trainingor testing, consists of all such features from its target word and each of its contextwords.
Given a context window of three tokens, among which one is target word,there are 2?8+13=29 features, plus an answer, in each data entry for training.After feature extraction, each data entry originally in the form of (1) is turnedinto a more general form for machine learning, as shown in (2) below, consistingof a feature value vector and an answer.f : [f1 =v1, f2 =v2, f3 =v3, ?
?
?
, fn =vn] ?
a: true/false .
(2)Accordingly, the Maxent model used in our experiments has the followingdistribution in the exponential form:p(a|f) = 1Z(f)exp(?i?i?
(fi, a)) , (3)where ?i is a parameter to be estimated for each i through training, the fea-ture function ?i(fi, a) = vi for the feature fi in a data entry f ?
a, and thenormalization factorZ(f) =?aexp(?i?i?
(fi, a)) .
(4)2.2 Abbreviation List and Sentence-Initial WordsIn addition to the above features, other types of contextual information canbe helpful too.
For example, abbreviated words like ?Dr.
?, ?Mr.?
and ?Prof.
?Period Disambiguation with Maxent Model 227may give a strong indication that the dot they carry is very unlikely to be aperiod.
They may play the role of counter-examples.
Another kind of usefullexical resource is sentence-initial words, e.g., ?The?, ?That?
and ?But?, whichgive a strong indication that a preceding dot is very likely to be a true period.In order to integrate these two kinds of lexical resource into the Maxentmodel, we introduce two multi-valued features, namely, isAbbr and isSentInit,for the target word and its following word, respectively.
They are both multi-valued feature function.
A list of abbreviated words and a list of sentence-initialwords can be easily compiled from a training corpus.
Theoretically, the largerthe lists are, the better the learning performance could be.
Our experiments, tobe reported in the next section, show, however, that this is not true, althoughusing the most frequent words in the two lists up to a certain number does leadto a significant improvement.3 Experiments and Results3.1 CorpusThe corpus used for our experiments is the PTB-II WSJ corpus, a refined versionof PTB [5].
It is particularly suitable for our research purpose.
In contrast toBNC and Brown corpus, the WSJ corpus indeed contains many more dots usedin different ways for various purposes.
Sentence ends are clearly marked in itsPOS tagged version, although a few mistakes need manual correction.
Among53K sentences from the corpus, 49K end with ?.?.
This set of data is dividedinto two for training and testing by the ratio of 2:1.
The baseline performanceby brute-force guess of any dot as a period is 65.02% over the entire set of data.3.2 Baseline Learning PerformanceOur first experiment is to train a Maxent model on the training set with athree-word context window in terms of the features in Tables 1 and 2 above.The performance on the open test is presented in Table 3.
It is the baselineperformance of the Maxent model.Table 3.

Effectiveness of context window1 for a context word in use.
For example, 01x10 represents a context window con-sisting of a target word, its preceding and following words.
Each such window isitself a context type.We can observe from the results that (1) the features extracted from thetarget word itself already lead the Maxent model to an F-score beyond 92%,(2) the context words preceding the target word are less effective, in general,than those following the target, and (3) combining context words on both sidesoutperforms those on only one side.
The best three context types and the cor-respondent performance are presented in Table 4.
Since they are more effectivethan others, the experiments to test the effectiveness of abbreviated words andsentence-initial words are based on them.Table 4.

To examine the significance of suchinformation, an abbreviation list is acquired from the training data by dotted wordcollection, and sorted in terms of the difference of each item?s occurrences in themiddle and at the end of a sentence.
It is assumed that the greater this difference is,the more significant a dotted word would be as a counter-example.
In total, 469such words are acquired, among which many are not really abbreviated words.A series of experiments are then conducted by adding the next 50 most frequentdotted words to the abbreviation list for model training each time.

That is,all words in the list actually play a role equivalent to individual bi-valued features,under the umbrella of this new feature.The outcomes from the experiments are presented in Fig.
2, showing thatperformance enhancement reaches rapidly to the top around 150.
The perfor-mance of the three best context types at this point is given in Table 5, indi-cating that an abbreviation list of 150 words leads to an enhancement of 1.99?2.43 percentage points, in comparison to Table 4.
This enhancement is verysignificant at this performance level.
Beyond this point, the performance goesdown slightly.3.5 Effectiveness of Sentence-Initial WordsIn a similar way, we carry out a series of experiments to test the effectivenessof sentence-initial words.
In total, 4190 such words (word types) are collectedfrom the beginning of all sentences in the training corpus.
Every time the next200 most frequent words are added to the sentence-initial word list for training,with the aid of another multi-valued feature isSentInit for the context wordimmediately following the target word.Experimental outcomes are presented in Fig.
3, showing that the performancemaintains roughly at the same level when the list grows.

The results are presented inTable 8, showing that the best combination is around 200 words from each listand any deviation from this point would lead to observable performance declina-tion.
The best performance at this optimal point is 99.8227% F-score, achievedwith the 01x10 context type, which is significantly better than the best perfor-mance using any single list of the two.Comparing to the baseline performance of the Maxent model in Table 4,we can see that this improvement increases only 99.8227 - 97.2623 = 2.5604percentage points.
Notice, however, that it is achieved near the ceiling level.
Itsparticular significance lies in the fact that 99.8227?97.2623100?97.2623 = 93.52% remainingerrors from the baseline model are further eliminated by this combination of thetwo lists, both of which are of a relatively small size.4 ConclusionsWe have presented in the above sections our recent investigation into how con-text window, feature space and simple lexical resources like abbreviation list andsentence-initial words affect the performance of the Maxent model on period dis-ambiguation, the kernel problem in sentence identification.
Our experiments onPTB-II WSJ corpus suggest the following findings: (1) the target word itself pro-vides most useful information for identifying whether or not the dot it carries is a232 C. Kit and X. Liutrue period, achieving an F-score beyond 92%; (2) unsurprisingly, the most usefulcontext words are the two words next to the target word, and the context words toits right is more informative in general than those to its left; and (3) extending thefeature space to utilize lexical information from the most frequent 200 abbreviatedwords and sentence-initial words, all of which can be straightforwardly collectedfrom the training corpus, can eliminate 93.52% remaining errors from the baselinemodel in the open test, achieving an F-score of 99.8227%.AcknowledgementsThe work described in this paper was supported by the Research Grants Councilof HKSAR, China, through the CERG grant 9040861 (CityU 1318/03H).
