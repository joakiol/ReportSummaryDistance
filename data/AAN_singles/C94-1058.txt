Underspecificationscan be caused by shortcomings of the componentproviding the input or by the prelhninary stal.eof incrementally given input.
The paper Mms toescape from such dead-end situations by making~ussumptions.
We discuss global aspects of de-fault handling.
Two i~roblem classes for defaultsin the incrementM syntactic gener;ttor VM-GENare presented to substantiate our discussion.1 MOTIVAT IONNatural Language Generation, i.e., the pro-cess of building an adequate utterance forsome given content, is by nature a decisionmaking problem (Appelt, 1985).
Interna.1 de-cisions are made on the basis of the specifiedinput.
Unfortunately, input information canbe insufficient in two respects:?
If the input structure for generation isprovided by another AI-system, .qloba.l prob-lems in producing svJ.Jicicnl inp't,t iuJ'orm.a.tio~,for the generator may occur, e.g., because o\['translation mismatches in inachine transla-tion (Kameyama, 19!)1).
In this case, the gen-erator eitl,er has to use a default or formulat.ea request for clarification in order to be abh~to continue its processing, i.e., to produce anutterance.
During simultaneous interpret a.-tion requests are rather unusual.
Ilere de-faults allow for a sta.ndalone handling of t:heproblem.
For example, problems duringspeech recognition of automatic interprel:a-tion can lead to results like, "the (man/men)will come to the hotel tomorrow".
If the sys-tem is not able to give a preference for oneof the alternatives, e.g., by evaluating con-text information, the generator has to choose"The author is eurrent, ly at NTT Network lurermation Systems Laboratories (kikui((Nlttnly.ntt..i P)a probable number value on its own to com-plete verbalization.?
Furthermore, for incremental generation,the input information is produced and hand-e.d own' step by step, so that it can be tem-poraril 9 ineomplele - -  although as a wholeit may become sufficient.
This behaviour of agenerator is motiw, ted by psycholinguistic ob-serva.tions which show that people~ start speak-lug 1)e\[bre all necessary linguistic material hasbeen chosen (e.g., articulating a noun phrasebe\['ore, the dominating w'.rb is selected).
As aconsequence of undersl)ecification , i cremen-tal generation is essentially based on workingwith defaults, l'~lements are uttered beforethe processing or input consuml%ion has beenfinished.
(Kita.no, 1990) gives an example fordefaults in i:he context of simultaneous inter-pretation: In Japanese, negation is specifiedat the end of the sentence while in English, ithas to be specified ill \['rent of the finite verb.Tllere\[bre, during .lapanese-English transla-tion, where analysis, l;ransfer, and general;ionare l)erformed in a para.llel and incrementalway, the system has to commit, e.g., positivewdm', l~el'ore knowing the actual polarlty I.Generally spea.kiug, dcfa.

So, one can compare default han-dling with advice to the system, l?or reasonso1" uncertainty of assumptions, incrementalsystems with this facility must be able to re-pair the default decision when the a.ssump-tion i;urns out to be wrong by informationgiven later.
Ca.tchi,lg on to the above exam-pie, there can be a nega.tion specifier given atthe end of the Japanese input sentence whichcannot be simply integrated into the outputlAlt.ernatively, the system could use i,he dialogueCOllt.exl.
1:o iufer a negal.ion wdue +/-.356sentence because the finite verb has ah'eadybeen uttered.
In this case, the output has tobe repaired, e.g., by repeating parts of the ut>terance: "I will be able to meet you .. .oops.
.
.
I  won't; be able to meet you at the hotelthis evening.
"In the tbllowing sections, we argue Ibr l.heappropriateness of processinq-conformi~ttj de-fault handling.
Basically, tlte processing-con-forming mode makes the overall system ho-mogenemzs because the combination ofdefault-caused processing and input-licensedprocessing requires no specific description.The homogeneity becomes especially hell)fulin the case where the inlmt wwifies the &,-fault assumption rendering mlnecessary anyrecomputation.
For 1;he opposite case wherethe default ll'ltlSt; be withdrawn we haw~ tomark all defaults.

Section 2 provides a geucraldescription for defaults iu generation empha-sizing the specific requirements in an incre-mental system.
After identifying the condi-tions under which defaults are triggered (set>tion 2.1), the application of a default (set>tion 2.2) and the delhfition of its descrilltioll(section 2.3) is outlined.
The crucial case ofremoving defa.ults not coi,lcidiug; wil.h n(,w-ly arriving input in an incremental system isdiscussed in section 2.4.In section 3, this mechanism is applic~l I.othe incremental sentence generator V M--(I EN.In tile beginning of the section, the basic <h'-sign of the sysi;em is outlined.
Lator on, de-fault handling is included and exemplified fortwo general cases.In tile final section we summarize the mainresults of the paper, l,'urthermore, we dis-cuss how default handling can I)e adapt?

)92).2 GENERAL D ISCUSSION OFDEFAULTSIn the literature of norl-incremental genera-tion, the need for defaults is hardly ever tak-en into account.
The conunon point of viewrestricts the iulmt to be sulIicient for genera-tion (see, e.g., the Te:ct Slructure by (Meteer,1990) for a syntactic generator).
In incremen-tal gm,eration, most authors agree on the ne-cessity of using defaults (see, e.g., (l)e Smedt,1990; Kitano, 1990; Ward, 1991)).
Neverthe-less, they do not in sufficient depth answerthe question of how to guide the processes ofdefault handling an(l repair wil;hin a gener-ator.
This I~roblem is the starting--point tbrthe following considerations.We assume tlm.t generation is a decision--making process witll the aim o\[' producing itphmsiMe ul:t(wance 1)ased on given informa-tion.
As mentioned in section 1, there arecases where this I)rocess stops (caused by un-derspccifical.ioll of the input) before finishingits output.We define a module named d@tv.l!
han-dh:r which tries to resume the process by giv-ing advice to il;, i.e., by maldng assumptionsabout tile missing input specification.
Withrespect to this task it is discussed1.

An incremental processing schemeallows for an increase of elficiency and flexi-bility, e.g., by making tlm analysis and gen-eral.ion l~rocesses of a system \['or simultane,-ous interl~ret, al:ion ow~rlap in Lime.

In most cases, er-rors should be recovered by appropriate self-corrections a.
Excessive use of self-correc-tions or erroneous expressions should beavoided because they decrease intdligibil-ity of the utterance.Obviously there is a trade-off between fluencyand reliability: maximal reliability requires'secure' decisions and theretbre leads to out-put delay.
On the other hand, maximal flu-ency necessitates the use of assuml)tions andrepair, respectively.2.1 When to T r igger  Defau l t  Hand l ingWe define as de.fa.~dt sit'ltatio~z the situationwhere a generation system has not yet fin-ished the utterance but at the same t;ime hasconsumed all given iul)ut and is not ahle tocontinue processing.
In non-incremental gel>eration, this corresponds to the fact that theinput lacks necessary informatiou, becausethe entire input is assumed to be given atone time (e.g., the undecidable number wdueof the example described in section 1 ).
Thus,default handling should be triggered inunedi-ately.In incremental generation, however, tile sys-tem may gel; a new piece of infBrmation lai:eron that enables it to continue processing (e.g.,the specification of a negation wdue + as out-lined in the example in section 1).
Tllere-fore, possible alternatives are either to waitfor the next inpnt or to trigger default han-dling.
The former violates the fluency goal,the latter may violate the reliability goal.
Wepropose the explicit use of time-limits .lot de-lay intervals 4 .=Ilumans often fill such pauses with filler.s like %r"or "what shall I say".aSometimes, correct, ion is mmeeessary il' (I.hespeaker believes that) the hearer ean inl>r t.he intend-ed utterance from errol~eous speech.4An explicit parameter xpressing tile desired e-gree of fluency influences the time--limit.s.Furthermore, the certainty of a &fault isdescribed by a value.
As soon aM a defaultsituation is identified, the certainty of the de-fault is checked to see whether it exceeds apredefined threshold that: determines the de-gree of fluency/relia.bility r'.l'.
;ach application o1" a default decreases theglobal certainty o\[' the system's tate.
Conse-quently, there should be a limit Jbr the mnzi-real n'~,mbcr of dcfoults apl)licable to the samesentence.2.2 How to In tegrate  Defau l t  Hand l ingBasically, there are two strategies to integratedefault handling into ongoing processing.\])efanlts may be handled in a way that dif-\[>rs from the 'normal' processing of the sys-tem, e.g., as short-cuts.

got incremental generation, tile sys-tem has to provide repair fa.cilil;ies in any case.So, they can also be used \['or nmt-monoloT/cnlodi\[ical,iOllS {~\[" d~q'aull, caused results.

When designing an incre-ment.el sysl`em, simple lm.ckl,racking is ruled359out because the part of the sentence utteredcannot be withdrawn after it has been per-ceived by the addressee of the message r.So, we end up with a processing-conform-ing default handler for generation realizing re-pair by non-monotonic hanges.3 EXAMPLES OF DEFAULTSIN  VM-GENThe adaptation of our general discussion ofdefault handling to the system VM-CEN notonly provides concrete xamples for the read-er but also shows that a homogeneous com-bination of default handling, regula.r process-ing, and utterance repair is possible.The syntactic generator VM-GI'~N is a fur-ther development of TA G-G E N (Kilger, 19!
)4)within the fi-amework of VERBMOBIL, aspeech-to-speech translation system.
Its use-fulness for simultaneous interpretation resultsfrom its incremental and pa'rallel style of pro-cessing.
VM-GEN is able to consume inputincreinents of varying size.
q'hese, incrementsdescribe lexical items or semantic relationsbetween them.
Single input increments arehanded over to objects of a distril)uted paral-lel system, each of which tries to verbalize thestructure that results from the correspondinginput increment.
VM-O,\]'~N uses ml exten-sion of Tree Adjoining Gra'm'mct'rs (TACs, c\['.
(aoshi, 1985)) as its syntactic representationformalism that is not only adequate for Ihedescription of natura.1 language hut also sup-ports incremental genera.lion (I(ilger aml Fin-kler, 1994).In the following, we iul;roduce xaml)h:'s fordefault processing triggered during the (ler-man inflection process in VM-GI'2N to suh-stantiate tile global statements made in sec~Lion 2.
Inflection uses some synta.cLic proper-ties of an element o compute its morpholog-ical form.
This information has partly t:o bespecified in the input (e.g., the numl)er for anoun) and is partly inherited fi'om other el-rlf some phrases inllueneed by defaull.s have al-ready been verbalized, the eft'eel; of verl~alizaLion canbe cancelled by using repair words like "oops" or "solry" when starting t, he modified utt.erance.ements (e.g., tile number for a verb or tilecase for a noun).
The two reasons for missinginformation ecessitate different methods oftreatment which nevertheless both can uni-formly be integrated into regular processing.If information of the first type is missing(e.g., because of problems during analysis, seesection 1), an assuml~tion can be made locallyby simulating the respective part of the input.The default for missing number informationin VM-CIBN would look as follows:\[ (e*.I(OBJ,=N) (I;,'NTITY OB.I \]( ....... ber(OBd)=NIL) => ('au',,dm,' sg)) ; 0.8 8The set of default preconditions is appliedto all 'j objects (OB.1) of VM-GEN in orderto Lest the kind of underspecification ('num-ber' in the example).
The default body intro-duces a new value (sg) by creating an inputincrement as a. default.
The test for coinci-dence with the input-licensed value is realizedby a comparison in the objects of VM-CEN.There is a. uuique association of input incre-ments and objocts of VM-(~EN (OBJ is usedas identifier)l:hat allows for translating an in-put mo(lifica.l:ion into a. modification of thestate of the respective object.
In ease of con-tradictions the dofa.ult and all default-causeddecisions are revised m (see below).Making a.n assumption can Im influenced by.qlolml constra.ints.

A default istriggered, if the preconditions match the cu>rent situation and the certainty value of thedefault exceeds the i)redefined threshold.
Thedefault body is expressed in terms of the miss-ing input specification in order to make thesystem work homogeneously.
We have veri-fied the advantages of processing-conformingdefault handling by implementing a defaulthandler for VM-GEN.As future work, we will extend the defaultpreconditions towards handling complex con-textual information.
We will apply defaulthandling to microplanning and lexical choicewithin VERBMOBIL.
With respect to a so-phisticated output, we aim to combine VM-(\]I3N with a flexible repair component.The system VM-GEN is used in the VI"llB-MOBIL scenario for multilingual generation(English, German, and .Japanese).
We meanby multilinguality that; the sa.me processingis applie(l for diflZ'rent languages.
In the un-derlying knowledge sources language-specificconstraints are defined.
Default handling canbe easily adapted to the requirements o\[' mul-tilingual generation \])y using language-si)eci(?ic default-descriptions.For all know/edge sources the question aris-es how knowledge can be shared.
