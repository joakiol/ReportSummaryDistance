We give an introduction to thealgorithms and efficient implementations,and discuss their applications to a range ofNLP tasks.1 IntroductionThis tutorial discusses a framework of onlineglobal discriminative learning and beam-searchdecoding for syntactic processing (Zhang andClark, 2011b), which has recently been appliedto a wide variety of natural language processing(NLP) tasks, including word segmentation (Zhangand Clark, 2007), dependency parsing (Zhang andClark, 2008b; Huang and Sagae, 2010; Zhang andNivre, 2011; Bohnet and Kuhn, 2012), contextfree grammar (CFG) parsing (Collins and Roark,2004; Zhang and Clark, 2009; Zhu et al., 2013),combinational categorial grammar (CCG) parsing(Zhang and Clark, 2011a; Xu et al., 2014) andmachine translation (Liu, 2013), achieving state-of-the-art accuracies and efficiencies.
In addition,due to its high efficiencies, it has also been ap-plied to a range of joint structural problems, suchas joint segmentation and POS-tagging (Zhangand Clark, 2008a; Zhang and Clark, 2010), jointPOS-tagging and dependency parsing (Hatori etal., 2011; Bohnet and Nivre, 2012), joint mor-phological analysis, POS-tagging and dependencyparsing (Bohnet et al., 2013), and joint segmenta-tion, POS-tagging and parsing (Zhang et al., 2013;Zhang et al., 2014).In addition to the aforementioned tasks, theframework can be applied to all structural pre-diction tasks for which the output can be con-structed using an incremental process.
The advan-tage of this framework is two-fold.
First, beam-search enables highly efficient decoding, whichtypically has linear time complexity, depending onthe incremental process.
Second, free from DP-style constraints and Markov-style independenceassumptions, the framework allows arbitrary fea-tures to be defined to capture structural patterns.In addition to feature advantages, the high accura-cies of this framework are also enabled by directinteractions between learning and search (Daum?eIII and Marcu, 2005; Huang et al., 2012; Zhangand Nivre, 2012).2 Tutorial OverviewIn this tutorial, we make an introduction to theframework, illustrating how it can be applied toa range of NLP problems, giving theoretical dis-cussions and demonstrating a software implemen-tation.
We start with a detailed introduction ofthe framework, describing the averaged percep-tron algorithm (Collins, 2002) and its efficient im-plementation issues (Zhang and Clark, 2007), aswell as beam-search and the early-update strategy(Collins and Roark, 2004).
We then illustrate howthe framework can be applied to NLP tasks, in-cluding word segmentation, joint segmentation &POS-tagging, labeled and unlabeled dependencyparsing, joint POS-tagging and dependency pars-ing, CFG parsing, CCG parsing, and joint segmen-tation, POS-tagging and parsing.
In each case, weillustrate how the task is turned into an incremen-tal left-to-right output-building process, and howrich features are defined to give competitive accu-racies.
These examples can serve as guidance inapplying the framework to other structural predic-tion tasks.In the second part of the tutorial, we givesome analysis on why the framework is effective.We discuss several alternative learning algorithms,13and compare beam-search with greedy search ondependency parsing.
We show that accuracy bene-fits from interaction between learning and search.Finally, the tutorial concludes with an introductionto ZPar, an open source toolkit that provides op-timized C++ implementations of of all the abovetasks.3 Outline1 Introduction (0.5 hours)1.1 An overview of the syntactic processingframework and its applications1.2 An introduction to the beam-searchframework and comparison to dynamicprogramming1.3 Algorithm in details1.3.1 Online discriminative learning usingthe perceptron1.3.2 Beam-search decoding1.3.3 The integrated framework2 Applications (1.25 hours)2.1 Overview2.2 Word segmentation2.3 Joint segmentation and POS-tagging2.4 Dependency parsing2.5 Context free grammar parsing2.6 Combinatory categorial grammar pars-ing2.7 Joint segmentation, POS-tagging andparsing3 Analysis of the framework (0.75 hours)3.1 The influence of global learning3.2 The influence of beam-search3.3 Benefits from the combination3.4 Related discussions4 The ZPar software tool (0.5 hours)4 About the PresentersYue Zhang is an Assistant Professor at SingaporeUniversity of Technology and Design (SUTD).Before joining SUTD in 2012, he worked as apostdoctoral research associate at University ofCambridge.
