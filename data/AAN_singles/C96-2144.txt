trAbstractWe present a constraint-based case flamelexicon arctfitecture fbr bi-directionMmapping between a syntactic ase Dameand a semantic Dame.
The lexicon usesa semantic sense as the basic unit andemploys a multi-tiered constraint struc-ture for the resolution of syntactic in-formation into the appropriate sensesand/or idiomatic usage.
VMency chang-ing transfbrmations such as morptnolog-ieally marked passivized or causativizedforms are handled via le:xical rules thatmanipulate case Dames templates.
Thesystem has been implemented in a typed-feature system and applied to Turkish.1 Int roduct ion-Recent adwmces in theoreticM and practical as-pects of feature and constraint-based tbrmMismsfor representing linguistic information have fos-tered research on the use of such formMisms inthe design and implementation of computationallexicons (Briscoe el al., 1993).
Case frame ap-proach has been the representation of choice es-pecially for languages with free constituent order,explicit case marking of noun phrases and embed-ded clauses filling nominal syntactic roles.
Thesemantics of such syntactic role fillers are usuallydetermined by their lexicM, semantic and mor-plmsyntactic properties, instead of position in thesentence.
In this paper, we present an approachto building a constraint-based case Dame lexiconfor use in natural language processing in Turkish.A number of observations tha.t we have made onTurkish tmve indicated that we have to go beyondthe traditional transitive and intransitive distinc-tion, and utilize a Damework where verb valenceis considered as the obligatory co-existence of anarbitrary subset of possible arguments along withthe obligatory exclusion of certain others, relativeto a verb seuse.
Addi t iona l  morphosynt~ct ic,  lex-ical and semantic selectional constrMnts are uti-lized to map a given syntactic argument structureto a specific verb sense.
In recent years, there havebeen several studies on constrmnt-based lexicons.iR,ussell el al.
(1993) propose an approach to mul-tiple default inheritance tbr unification-based lexi-con.
In another study by Lascarides et el.
(1995),an ordered approach to default unification is sug-gested, de Paiva (1993) tbrmalizes the systemof well-fornmd typed feature struetures.
In thisstudy, type hierarchies and relations are mathe-matically defined.
They also formalize unificationand generalization operators between tin(; featm:estructures, along with defining well-formednessnotion that we use in our system.2 Representing Case FrameI n fo rmat ionIn rlhu'kish, (and possibly in many other lan-guages) verbs often convey several meanings(some totally unrelated) when they are used withsubjects, objects, oblique objects, adverbiM ad-juncts, with certain lexical, morphological, andsemantic features, and co occurrence restrictions.In addition to the usual sense wu:iations due to se-lectional restrictions on verbal arguments, in mostcases, the meaning conveyed by a. case Dante is id-iomatic, with subtle constrMnts.
For example, theTurkisln verb ye (cat), when used with a direct ob-ject noun phrase whose head is:1. para (money), with no case or possessivemarkings and a lmman subject, means to ac-cept bribe,2.
pare (money), wittn a non-human subject,means to cost a lol,3.
para (or any other NP whose head is onto-logically IS-A money, e.g., dolar, mark, etc.
)with obligatory accusative markilig ~md op-tional possessive meriting, means to spend*~IO~tCy~4.
kafa (head) with obligatory accusative mark-ing and no possessive marking, means to getmentally deranged,5.
hak (right) with optionM accusative and pos-sessive markings, mearls to be unfair,8546.

value object (dative case-marked NP or PPwith a certain PFORH).In general, there may be more than one instan-tiation of the SEM frame for a given instantiatedset of case frame arguments (and vice versa).
Forinstance, for the ye verb discussed above, the ar-gument structure for the third case giving rise tothe meaning to get mentally deranged may con-ceivably give rise to a literal meaning in a ratherimprobable context (such as eating the head of afish at dinner - much in the spirit of the two inter-pretations of the English idiom kick the bucket),or the same semantics may be expressed by a dif-ferent surface form.3.2 Const ra int  Areh l teetureWe express constraints on the arguments in thecase frame of a verb via a 5-tier constraint hierar-chy sharing constraints among the specification ofother constraints and sense definitions, wheneverpossible:NP's that have no case-marking in Turkish.1.
Constraints on verb features that describeany relevant constraints on tile morphologi-cal features of the verb, such as agreement orvoice markers.2.
Constraints on mou)hological features thatdescribe any obligatory constraints on the ar-guments, such as case-marking, verb form (inthe case of embedded clauses), etc.3.
Constraints on argument co-occurrence thatexpress obligatory argument co-occurrenceconstraints along with constraints that indi-cate when certain arguments should not occurin order resolve a sense.4.
Lexieal constraints that indicate any specificconstraints on the heads of the arguments inorder to convey a certain sense, and usuallyconstrain the stem of the head noun to be acertain lexical form, or one of a small set 'oflexical forms.5.
Semantic Constraints that indicate seman-tic selectional restriction constraints thatmay resolved using a companion ontologi-cal database (again implemented in TFS) inwhich we model the world by defining se-mantic categories, uch as human, thing, non-living object, living object, etc., along the linesdescribed by Nagao et al (1985).Figure 2 illustrates the simplified form of theconstraint-sense mapping of the verb yc (eal).a.a Va leney  Chang ing  Transtbrmat ionsAs we have already stated, we encode senses ofverbs in active voice unless a verb has an idiomaticusage with obligatory passive, causative and/or856reflexive voices.
