Mahesh K. SinhaDepartment of Computer Science & EngineeringIndian Institute of Technology, KanpurKanpur 208016 Indiarmk@iitk.ac.inAbstractComplex predicate is a noun, a verb, an ad-jective or an adverb followed by a light verbthat behaves as a single unit of verb.
Com-plex predicates (CPs) are abundantly used inHindi and other languages of Indo Aryanfamily.
Detecting and interpreting CPs con-stitute an important and somewhat a diffi-cult task.
The linguistic and statisticalmethods have yielded limited success inmining this data.
In this paper, we present asimple method for detecting CPs of all kindsusing a Hindi-English parallel corpus.
A CPis hypothesized by detecting absence of theconventional meaning of the light verb inthe aligned English sentence.
This simplestrategy exploits the fact that CP is a multi-word expression with a meaning that is dis-tinct from the meaning of the light verb.
Al-though there are several shortcomings in themethodology, this empirical method surpri-singly yields mining of CPs with an averageprecision of 89% and a recall of 90%.1 IntroductionComplex predicates (CPs) are abundantly used inHindi and other languages of Indo-Aryan familyand have been widely studied (Hook, 1974; Ab-bi, 1992; Verma, 1993; Mohanan, 1994; Singh,1994; Butt, 1995; Butt and Geuder, 2001; Buttand Ramchand, 2001; Butt et al, 2003).
A com-plex predicate is a multi-word expression(MWE) where a noun, a verb or an adjective isfollowed by a light verb (LV) and the MWE be-haves as a single unit of verb.
The general theoryof complex predicate is discussed in Alsina(1996).
These studies attempt to model the lin-guistic facts of complex predicate formation andthe associated semantic roles.CPs empower the language in its expressive-ness but are hard to detect.
Detection and inter-pretation of CPs are important for several tasksof natural language processing tasks such as ma-chine translation, information retrieval, summa-rization etc.
A mere listing of the CPs constitutesa valuable linguistic resource for lexicographers,wordnet designers (Chakrabarti et al, 2007) andother NLP system designers.
Computational me-thod using Hindi corpus has been used to mineCPs and categorize them based on statisticalanalysis (Sriram and Joshi, 2005) with limitedsuccess.
Chakrabarti et al (2008) present a me-thod for automatic extraction of V+V CPs onlyfrom a corpus based on linguistic features.
Theyreport an accuracy of about 98%.
An attempt hasalso been made to use a parallel corpus for de-tecting CPs using projection POS tags from Eng-lish to Hindi (Soni, Mukerjee and Raina, 2006).It uses Giza++ word alignment tool to align theprojected POS information.
A success of 83%precision and 46% recall has been reported.In this paper, we present a simple strategy formining of CPs in Hindi using projection ofmeaning of light verb in a parallel corpus.
In thefollowing section the nature of CP in Hindi isoutlined and this is followed by system design,experimentation and results.2 Complex Predicates in HindiA CP in Hindi is a syntactic construction consist-ing of either  a verb, a noun, an adjective or anadverb as main predicator followed by a lightverb (LV).
Thus, a CP can be a noun+LV, anadjective+LV, a verb+LV or an adverb+LV.
Fur-ther, it is also possible that a CP is followed by aLV (CP+LV).
The light verb carries the tenseand agreement morphology.
In V+V CPs, thecontribution of the light verb denotes aspectualterms such as continuity, perfectivity, inception,completion, or denotes an expression of forceful-ness, suddenness, etc.
(Singh, 1994; Butt, 1995).The CP in a sentence syntactically acts as a sin-gle lexical unit of verb that has a meaning dis-40tinct from that of the LV.
CPs are also referred asthe complex or compound verbs.Given below are some examples:(1): CP=noun+LVnoun = ashirwad {blessings}LV = denaa {to give}usane mujhe ashirwad diyaa.????
???
???????
????
{he     me   blessings  gave}he blessed me.
(2) No CPusane mujhe ek pustak dii.????
???
???
?????
??
{he    me  one  book  gave}he gave me a book.In (1), the light verb diyaa (gave) in its past tenseform with the noun ashirwad (blessings) makes acomplex predicate verb form ashirwad diyaa(blessed) in the past tense form.
The CP here isashirwad denaa and its corresponding Englishtranslation is ?to bless?.
On the other hand in ex-ample (2), the verb  dii (gave) is a simple verb inpast tense form and is not a light verb.
Although,same Hindi verb denaa (to give) is used in boththe examples, it is a light verb in (1) and a mainverb in (2).
Whether it acts as a light verb or not,depends upon the semantics of the precedingnoun.
However, it is observed that the Englishmeaning in case of the complex predicate is notderived from the individual meanings of the con-stituent words.
It is this observation that formsbasis of our approach for mining of CPs.
(3) CP=adjective+LVadjective=khush {happy}LV=karanaa {to do}usane mujhe khush kiyaa.????
???
????
????
{he   me  happy did}he pleased me.Here the Hindi verb kiyaa (did) is the past tenseform of a light verb karanaa (to do) and the pre-ceding word khush (happy) is an adjective.
TheCP here is khush karanaa (to please).
(4) CP=verb+LVverb = paRhnaa {to read}LV = lenaa {to take}usane pustak paRh liyaa.????
?????
??
????
{he    book  read took}he has read  the book.Here the Hindi verb liyaa (took) is the past tenseform of the light verb lenaa (to take) and the pre-ceding word paRh (read) is the verb paRhnaa (toread) in its stem form.
The CP is paRh lenaa (tofinish reading).
In such cases the light verb actsas an aspectual /modal or as an intensifier.
(5) CP=verb+LVverb = phaadanaa {to tear}LV = denaa {to give}usane pustak phaad diyaa.????
?????
???
????
{he    book   tear  gave}he has torn  the book.Here the Hindi verb diyaa (gave) is the past tenseform of the light verb denaa (to give) and thepreceding word phaad (tear) is the stem form ofthe  verb phaadanaa (to tear) .
The CP is phaaddenaa (to cause and complete act of tearing).
(6) CP=verb+LVverb = denaa {to give}LV = maaranaa{to hit/ to kill}usane pustak de maaraa.????
?????
??
????
{he   book  give  hit}he threw the book.Here the Hindi verb maaraa (hit/killed) is thepast tense form of the light verb maaranaa (tohit/ to kill) and the preceding word de (give) is averb denaa (to give) in its stem form.
The CP isde maranaa (to throw).
The verb combinationyields a new meaning.
This may also be consi-dered as a semi-idiomatic construct by somepeople.
(7) CP=adverb+LV1+LV2adverb = vaapas{back}LV1 = karanaa{to do}LV2 = denaa{to give}orCP = CP+LVCP = vaapas karanaa{to return}LV = denaa{to give}usane pustak vaapas kar  diyaa.????
?????
????
??
????
{he    book   back   do  gave}41he returned the book.Here there are two Hindi light verbs used.
Theverb kar (do) is the stem form of the light verbkaranaa (to do) and the verb diyaa (gave) is thepast tense form of the light verb denaa (to give).The preceding word vaapas (back) is an adverb.One way of interpretation is that the CP (a con-junct verb) vaapas karanaa (to return) is fol-lowed by another LV denaa (to give) signifyingcompletion of the task.
Another way of lookingat it is to consider these as a combination of twoCPs, vaapas karanaa (to return) and kar denaa(to complete the act).
The semantic interpreta-tions in the two cases remain the same.
It may benoted that the word vaapas (return) is also a nounand in such a case the CP is a noun+LV.From all the above examples, the complexityof the task of mining the CPs is evident.
Howev-er, it is also observed that in the translated text,the meaning of the light verb does not appear incase of CPs.
Our methodology for mining CPs isbased on this observation and is outlined in thefollowing section.3 System DesignAs outlined earlier, our method for detecting aCP is based on detecting a mismatch of the Hindilight verb meaning in the aligned English sen-tence.
The steps involved are as follows:1) Align the sentences of Hindi-English corpus;2) Create a list of Hindi light verbs and theircommon English meanings as a simple verb;(Table 1)3) For each Hindi light verb, generate all themorphological forms (Figure 1);4) For each English meaning of the light verb asgiven in table 1, generate all the morphologi-cal forms (Figure 2);5) For each Hindi-English aligned sentence,execute the following steps:a) For each light verb of Hindi (table 1),execute the following steps:i) Search for a Hindi light verb (LV)and its morphological derivatives(figure 1) in the Hindi sentence andmark its position in the sentence (K);ii) If the LV or its morphological deriv-ative is found, then search for theequivalent English meanings for anyof the morphological forms (figure2) in the corresponding aligned Eng-lish sentence;iii) If no match is found, then scan thewords in the Hindi sentence to theleft of the Kth position (as identifiedin step (i)); else if a match is found,then exit {i.e.
go to step (a)}.iv) If the scanned word is a ?stop word?
(figure 3), then ignore it and contin-ue scanning;v) Stop the scan when it is not a ?stopword?
and collect the Hindi word(W);vi) If W is an ?exit word?
then exit {i.e.go to step (a)}, else the identified CPis W+LV.Hindi has a large number of light verbs.
A listof some of the commonly used light verbs alongwith their common English meanings as a simpleverb is given in table 1.
The light verb kar (do) isthe most frequently used light verb.
Using itsliteral meaning as ?do?, as a criterion for testingCP is quite misleading since ?do?
in English isused in several other contexts.
Such meaningshave been shown within parentheses and are notused for matching.light verb base form root verb meaningbaithanaa ?????

Some of the common light verbs in Hindi42For each of the Hindi light verb, all morpho-logical forms are generated.
A few illustrationsare given in figures 1(a) and 1(b).
Similarly, foreach of the English meaning of the light verb, allof its morphological derivatives are generated.Figure 2 shows a few illustrations of the same.There are a number of words that can appearin between the nominal and the light verb in aCP.
These words are ignored in search for a CPand are treated as stop words.
These are wordsthat denote negation or are emphasizers, inten-sifiers, interrogative pronoun or a particle.
A listof stop words used in the experimentation is giv-en in figure 3.Figure 1(a).

Figure 4 shows a partial list used.However, this list can be augmented based onanalysis of errors in LV identification.
It shouldbe noted that we do not perform parts of speech(POS) tagging and so the nature of the word pre-ceding the LV is unknown to the system.English word: sitMorphological derivations:sit sits sat sittingEnglish word: giveMorphological derivations:give gives gave given giving????

A few exit words in Hindi used by thesystemThe inner loop of the procedure identifies mul-tiple CPs that may be present in a sentence.
Theouter loop is for mining the CPs in the entirecorpus.
The experimentation and results are dis-cussed in the following section.4 Experimentation and ResultsThe CP mining methodology outlined earlier hasbeen implemented and tested over multiple filesof EMILLE  (McEnery, Baker, Gaizauskas andCunningham, 2000) English-Hindi parallel cor-pus.
A summary of the results obtained are givenin table 2.
As can be seen from this table, theprecision obtained is 80% to 92% and the recallis between 89% to 100%.
The F-measure is 88%to 97%.
This is a remarkable and somewhat sur-prising result from the simple methodologywithout much of linguistic or statistical analysis.This is much higher than what has been reportedon the same corpus by Mukerjee et al 2006(83% precision and 46% recall) who use projec-tion of POS and word alignment for CP identifi-cation.
This is the only other work that uses aparallel corpus and covers all kinds of CPs.
Theresults as reported by Chakrabarti et al (2008)are only for V-V CPs.

(torespect)Here also the two CPs identified are correct.It is obvious that this empirical method ofmining CPs will fail whenever the Hindi lightverb maps on to its core meaning in English.
Itmay also produce garbage as POS of the preced-ing word is not being checked.
However, themining success rate obtained speaks of these be-ing in small numbers in practice.
Use of the?stop words?
in allowing the intervening wordswithin the CPs helps a lot in improving the per-formance.
Similarly, use of the ?exit words?avoid a lot of incorrect identification.5 ConclusionsThe simple empirical method for mining CPsoutlined in this work, yields an average 89% ofprecision and 90% recall which is better than theresults reported so far in the literature.
The majordrawback is that we have to generate a list of allpossible light verbs.
This list appears to be verylarge for Hindi.
Since no POS tagging or statis-tical analysis is performed, the identified CPs aremerely a list of mined CPs in Hindi with no lin-guistic categorization or analysis.
However, thislist of mined CPs is valuable to the lexicograph-ers and other language technology developers.This list can also be used for word alignmenttools where the identified components of CPs aregrouped together before the word alignmentprocess.
This will increase both the alignmentaccuracy and the speed.The methodology presented in this work isequally applicable to all other languages withinthe Indo-Aryan family.ReferencesAnthony McEnery, Paul Baker, Rob Gaizauskas, Ha-mish Cunningham.
