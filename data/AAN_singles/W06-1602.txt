We present a cor-pus annotated for superlatives and pro-pose an interpretation algorithm that usesa wide-coverage parser and produces se-mantic representations.
We achieve F-scores between 0.84 and 0.91 for detectingattributive superlatives and an accuracy inthe range of 0.69?0.84 for determining thecorrect comparison set.
As far as we areaware, this is the first automated approachto superlatives for open-domain texts andquestions.1 IntroductionAlthough superlative noun phrases (the nation?slargest milk producer, the most complex arms-control talks ever attempted, etc.)
received consid-erable attention in formal linguistics (Szabolcsi,1986; Gawron, 1995; Heim, 1999; Farkas andKiss, 2000), this interest is not mirrored in com-putational linguistics and NLP.
On the one hand,this seems remarkable, since superlatives are fairlyfrequently found in natural language.
On the otherhand, this is probably not that surprising, giventhat their semantic complexity requires deep lin-guistic analysis that most wide-coverage NLP sys-tems do not provide.But even if NLP systems incorporated linguisticinsights for the automatic processing of superla-tives, it might not be of help: the formal semanticsliterature on superlatives focuses on linguisticallychallenging examples (many of them artificiallyconstructed) which might however rarely occur inreal data and would therefore have little impacton the performance of NLP systems.
Indeed, nocorpus-based studies have been conducted to get acomprehensive picture of the variety of configura-tions superlatives exhibit, and their distribution inreal occurring data.In this paper we describe our work on the anal-ysis of superlative adjectives, which is empiri-cally grounded and is implemented into an exist-ing wide-coverage text understanding system.
Toget an overview of the behaviour of superlativesin text, we annotated newswire data, as well asqueries obtained from search engines logs.
Onthe basis of this corpus study, we propose, imple-ment and evaluate a syntactic and semantic analy-sis for superlatives.
To the best of our knowledge,this is the first automated approach to the interpre-tation of superlatives for open-domain texts thatis grounded on actual corpus-evidence and thor-oughly evaluated.
Some obvious applications thatwould benefit from this work are question answer-ing, recognition of entailment, and more generallyrelation extraction systems.2 Syntax and Semantics of Superlatives2.1 Surface FormsIn English, superlative adjectives appear in a largevariety of syntactic and morphological forms.One-syllable adjectives and some two-syllable ad-jectives are directly inflected with the suffix ?-est?.Some words of two syllables and all words of threeor more syllables are instead introduced by ?most?
(or ?least?).
Superlatives can be modified by ordi-nals, cardinals or adverbs, such as intensifiers ormodals, and are normally preceeded by the defi-nite article or a possessive.
The examples belowillustrate the wide variety and uses of superlativeadjectives.9the tallest womanAS Roma?s quickest playerthe Big Board?s most respected floor tradersFrance?s third-largest chemical groupthe most-recent wave of friendly takeoversthe two largest competitorsthe the southern-most tip of Englandits lowest possible pricesSuperlative adjectives can manifest themselvesin predicative (?Mia is the tallest.?)
or attributiveform (?the tallest woman?).
Furthermore, thereare superlative adverbs, such as ?most recently?,and idiomatic usages.2.2 The Comparison SetIt is well known that superlatives can be analysedin terms of comparative constructions (Szabolcsi,1986; Alshawi, 1992; Gawron, 1995; Heim, 1999;Farkas and Kiss, 2000).
Accordingly, ?the oldestcharacter?
can be interpreted as the character suchthat there is no older character, in the given con-text.
Therefore, a correct semantic interpretationof the superlative depends on the correct charac-terisation of the comparison set.
The comparisonset denotes the set of entities that are compared toeach other with respect to a certain dimension (seeSection 2.3).
In ?the oldest character in the book?,the members of the comparison set are charactersin the book, and the dimension of comparison isage.The computation of the comparison set is com-plicated by complex syntactic structure involvingthe superlative.
The presence of possessives forexample, as in ?AS Roma?s quickest player?, ex-tends the comparison set to players of AS Roma.Prepositional phrases (PPs), gerunds, and relativeclauses introduce additional complexity.
PPs thatare attached to the head noun of the superlative arepart of the comparison set ?
those that modifythe entire NP are not.
Similarly, restrictive rel-ative clause are included in the comparison set,non-restrictive aren?t.We illustrate this complexity in the followingexamples, taken from the Wall Street Journal,where the comparison set is underlined:The oldest designer got to work on the dash-board, she recalls.
(WSJ02)A spokesman for Borden Inc., the nation?slargestmilk producer, concedes Goya may be onto something.
(WSJ02)Right now, the largest loan the FHA caninsure in high-cost housing markets is $101,250.
(WSJ03)With newspapers being the largest singlecomponent of solid waste in our landfills ...(WSJ02)... questions being raised by what gen-erally are considered the most complexarms-control talks ever attempted.
(WSJ02)Besides syntactic ambiguities, the determina-tion of the comparison set can be further compli-cated by semantic ambiguities.
Some occurrencesof superlatives licence a so-called ?comparitive?reading, as in the following example discussed inthe formal semantics literature (Heim, 1999; Sz-abolcsi, 1986):John climbed the highest mountain.Here, in the standard interpretion, the moun-tain referred to is the highest available in the con-text.
However, another interpretation might arisein a situation where several people climbed severalmountains, and John climbed a mountain higherthan anyone else did, but not necessarily the high-est of all mountains in the context.
Our corpusstudy reveals that these readings are rare, althoughthey tend to be more frequent in questions than innewspaper texts.2.3 DimensionPart of the task of semantically interpretating su-perlative adjectives is the selection of the dimen-sion on which entities are compared.
In ?thehighest mountain?
we compare mountains with re-spect to the dimension height, in ?the best paper?we compare papers with respect to the dimensionquality, and so on.
A well-known problem is thatsome adjectives can be ambiguous or vague inchoosing their dimension.
Detecting the appropri-ate dimension is not covered in this paper, but isorthogonal to the analysis we provide.2.4 Superlatives and EntailmentSuperlatives exhibit a non-trivial semantics.
Someexamples of textual entailment make this very ev-ident.
Consider the contrasts in the following en-tailment tests with indefinite and universally quan-tified noun phrases:I bought a blue car |= I bought a carI bought a car 6|= I bought a blue carI bought every blue car 6|= I bought every carI bought every car |= I bought every blue car10Observe that the directions of entailments aremirrorred.
Now consider a similar test with su-perlatives, where the entailments fail in both di-rections:I bought the cheapest blue car 6|= I bought the cheapest carI bought the cheapest car 6|= I bought the cheapest blue car.These entailment tests underline the point thatthe meaning of superlatives is rather complicated,and that a shallow semantic representation, say?x.
[cheapest(x) ?
car(x)] for ?cheapest car?, sim-ply won?t suffice.
A semantic represention captur-ing the meaning of a superlative requires a moresophisticated analysis.
In particular, it is impor-tant to explicitly represent the comparison set ofa superlative.
In ?the cheapest car?, the compar-ison set is formed by the set of cars, whereas in?the cheapest blue car?, the comparison set is theset of blue cars.
Semantically, we can represent?cheapest blue car?
as follows, where the compar-ison set is made explicit in the antecedent of theconditional:?x.
[car(x) ?
blue(x) ?
?y((car(y) ?
blue(y) ?
x 6=y) ?
cheaper(x,y))]Paraphrased in English, this stipulates that someblue car is cheaper than any other blue car.
Ameaning representation like this will logically pre-dict the correct entailment relations for superla-tives.3 Annotated Corpus of SuperlativesIn order to develop and evaluate our system wemanually annotated a collection of newspaper arti-cle and questions with occurrences of superlatives.The design of the corpus and its characteristics aredescribed in this section.3.1 Classification and Annotation SchemeInstances of superlatives are identified in text andclassified into one of four possible classes: at-tributive, predicative, adverbial, or idiomatic:its rates will be among the highest (predicative)the strongest dividend growth (attributive)free to do the task most quickly (adverbial)who won the TONY for best featured actor?
(idiom)For all cases, we annotate the span of the su-perlative adjective in terms of the position of thetokens in the sentence.
For instance, in ?its1 rates2will3 be4 among5 the6 highest7?, the superlativespan would be 7?7.Additional information is encoded for the at-tributive case: type of determiner (possessive, def-inite, bare, demonstrative, quantifier), number (sg,pl, mass), cardinality (yes, no), modification (ad-jective, ordinal, intensifier, none).
Table 1 showssome examples from the WSJ with annotation val-ues.Not included in this study are adjectives suchas ?next?, ?past?, ?last?, nor the ordinal ?first?,although they somewhat resemble superlatives intheir semantics.
Also excluded are adjectives thatlexicalise a superlative meaning but are not su-perlatives morphologically, like ?main?, ?princi-pal?, and the like.
For etymological reasons wehowever include ?foremost?
and ?uttermost.
?3.2 Data and AnnotationOur corpus consists of a collection of newswirearticles from the Wall Street Journal (Sections 00,01, 02, 03, 04, 10, and 15) and the Glasgow Her-ald (GH950110 from the CLEF evaluation forum),and a large set of questions from the TREC QAevaluation exercise (years 2002 and 2003) andnatural language queries submitted to the Excitesearch engine (Jansen and Spink, 2000).
The datawas automatically tokenised, but all typos andextra-grammaticalities were preserved.
The cor-pus was split into a development set used for tun-ing the system and a test set for evaluation.
Thesize of each sub-corpus is shown in Table 2.Table 2: Size of each data source (in number ofsentences/questions)source dev test totalWSJ 8,058 6,468 14,526GH ?

One section of the WSJ was anno-tated by both annotators independently to calcu-late inter-annotator agreement.
All other docu-ments were first annotated by one judge and thenchecked by the second, in order to ensure max-imum correctness.
All disagreements were dis-cussed and resolved for the creation of a gold stan-dard corpus.Inter-annotator agreement was assessed mainlyusing f-score and percentage agreement as well as11Table 1: Annotation examples of superlative adjectivesexample sup span det num car mod comp setThe third-largest thrift institution in Puerto Ricoalso [.

In using f-score, we arbitrarily takeone of the annotators?
decisions (A) as gold stan-dard and compare them with the other annotator?sdecisions (B).
Note that here f-score is symmetric,since precision(A,B) = recall(B,A), and (balanced)f-score is the harmonic mean of precision and re-call (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Hachey et al, 2005,see also Section 5).We evaluated three levels of agreement on asample of 1967 sentences (one full WSJ section).The first level concerns superlative detection: towhat extent different human judges can agree onwhat constitutes a superlative.
For this task, f-score was measured at 0.963 with a total of 79 su-perlative phrases agreed upon.The second level of agreement is relative to typeidentification (attributive, predicative, adverbial,idiomatic), and is only calculated on the subsetof cases both annotators recognised as superlatives(79 instances, as mentioned).
The overall f-scorefor the classification task is 0.974, with 77 caseswhere both annotators assigned the same type toa superlative phrase.
We also assessed agreementfor each class, and the attributive type resulted themost reliable with an f-score of 1 (total agree-ment on 64 cases), whereas there was some dis-agreement in classifying predicative and adverbialcases (0.9 and 0.8 f-score, respectively).
Idiomaticuses where not detected in this portion of the data.To assess this classification task we also used thekappa statistics which yielded KCo=0.922 (fol-lowing (Eugenio and Glass, 2004) we report Kas KCo, indicating that we calculate K a` la Co-hen (Cohen, 1960).
KCo over 0.9 is considered tosignal very good agreement (Krippendorff, 1980).The third and last level of agreement deals withthe span of the comparison set and only concernsattributive cases (64 out of 79).
Percentage agree-ment was used since this is not a classification taskand was measured at 95.31%.The agreement results show that the task ap-pears quite easy to perform for linguists.
Despitethe limited number of instances compared, this hasalso emerged from the annotators?
perception ofthe difficulty of the task for humans.3.3 DistributionThe gold standard corpus comprises a total of3,045 superlatives, which roughly amounts to onesuperlative in every 25 sentences/questions.
Theoverwhelming majority of superlatives are attribu-tive (89.1%), and only a few are used in a pred-icative way (6.9%), adverbially (3.0%), or in id-iomatic expressions (0.9%).1 Table 3 shows thedetailed distribution according to data source andexperimental sets.
Although the corpus also in-cludes annotation about determination, modifica-tion, grammatical number, and cardinality of at-tributive superlatives (see Section 3.1), this infor-mation is not used by the system described in thispaper.Table 3: Distribution of superlative types in thedevelopment and evaluation sets.dev testtype WSJ TREC WSJ GH Excite totalatt 240 43 218 68 2,145 2,714pre 40 3 26 17 125 211adv 17 2 22 9 41 91idi 6 5 1 2 15 29total 303 53 267 96 2,326 3,0454 Automatic Analysis of SuperlativesThe system that we use to analyse superlatives isbased on two linguistic formalisms: CombinatoryCategorial Grammar (CCG), for a theory of syn-tax; and Discourse Representation Theory (DRT)1Percentages are rounded to the first decimal and do notnecessarily sum up to 100%.12for a theory of semantics.
In this section we will il-lustrate how we extend these theories to deal withsuperlatives and how we implemented this into aworking system.4.1 Combinatory Categorial Grammar(CCG)CCG is a lexicalised theory of grammar (Steed-man, 2001).
We used Clark & Curran?s wide-coverage statistical parser (Clark and Curran,2004) trained on CCG-bank, which in turn is de-rived from the Penn-Treebank (Hockenmaier andSteedman, 2002).
In CCG-bank, the majority ofsuperlative adjective of cases are analysed as fol-lows:the tallest womanNP/N N/N NNNPmost devastating droughts(N/N)/(N/N) N/N NN/NNthird largest bankN/N (N/N)\(N/N) NN/NNClark & Curran?s parser outputs besides a CCGderivation of the input sentence also a part-of-speech (POS) tag and a lemmatised form for eachinput token.
To recognise attributive superla-tives in the output of the parser, we look bothat the POS tag and the CCG-category assignedto a word.
Words with POS-tag JJS and CCG-category N/N, (N/N)/(N/N), or (N/N)\(N/N) areconsidered attributive superlatives adjectives, andso are the words ?most?
and ?least?
with CCG cat-egory (N/N)/(N/N).However, most hyphenated superlatives are notrecognised by the parser as JJ instead of JJS, andare corrected in a post-processing step.2 Examplesthat fall in this category are ?most-recent wave?and ?third-highest?.4.2 Discourse Representation Theory (DRT)The output of the parser, a CCG derivation of theinput sentence, is used to construct a DiscourseRepresentation Structure (DRS, the semantic rep-resentation proposed by DRT (Kamp and Reyle,2This is due to the fact that the Penn-Treebank annotationguidelines prescribe that all hyphenated adjectives ought tobe tagged as JJ.1993)).
We follow (Bos et al, 2004; Bos, 2005) inautomatically building semantic representation onthe basis of CCG derivations in a compositionalfashion.
We briefly summarise the approach here.The semantic representation for a word is deter-mined by its CCG category, POS-tag, and lemma.Consider the following lexical entries:the: ?p.?q.
(x;p(x);q(x))tallest: ?p.?x.
( (yy 6=x;p(y))?taller(x,y);p(x))man: ?x.man(x)These lexical entries are combined in a compo-sitional fashion following the CCG derivation, us-ing the ?-calculus as a glue language:tallest man: ?x.man(x)yy6=xman(y)?taller(x,y)the tallest man: ?q.
(xman(x)yy6=xman(y)?taller(x,y);q(x))In this way DRSs can be produced in a robustway, achieving high-coverage.
An example outputrepresentation of the complete system is shown inFigure 1.As is often the case, the output of the parser isnot always what one needs to construct a meaning-ful semantic representation.
There are two caseswhere we alter the CCG derivation output by theparser in order to improve the resulting DRSs.
Thefirst case concerns modifiers following a superla-tive construction, that are attached to the NP noderather than N. A case in point is... the largest toxicology lab in NewEngland ...where the PP in New England has the CCG cate-gory NP\NP rather than N\N.
This would resultin a comparison set containing of toxicology labs,rather than a set toxicology labs in New England.The second case are possessive NPs precedinga superlative construction.
An example here is... Jaguar?s largest shareholder ...13_______________________________________________| x0 x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 ||-----------------------------------------------|| acquisition(x1) || nn(x0,x1) || named(x0,georgia-pacific,nam) || named(x2,nekoosa,loc) || of(x1,x2) || company(x5) || nn(x3,x5) || forest-product(x3) || nn(x4,x5) || named(x4,us,loc) || ____________________ ________________ || | x7 x8 x9 | | | || |--------------------| |----------------| || | company(x9) | ==> | largest(x5,x9) | || | nn(x7,x9) | |________________| || | forest-product(x7) | || | nn(x8,x9) | || | named(x8,us,loc) | || | _________ | || | | | | || | __ |---------| | || | | | x5 = x9 | | || | |_________| | || |____________________| || create(x6) || agent(x6,x1) || patient(x6,x5) || event(x6) ||_______________________________________________|Figure 1: Example DRS outputwhere a correct interpretation of the superlativerequires a comparison set of shareholders fromJaguar, rather than just any shareholder.
However,the parser outputs a derivation where ?largest?
iscombined with ?shareholder?, and then with thepossessive construction, yielding the wrong se-mantic interpretation.
To deal with this, we anal-yse possessives that interact with the superlative asfollows:Rome ?s oldest churchNP ((NP/N)/(N/N)\NP N/N N(NP/N)/(N/N)NP/NNPThis analysis yields the correct comparison set forsuperlative that follow a possessive noun phrase,given the following lexical semantics for the geni-tive:?n.?S.?p.?q.(u;S(?x.
(p(x);n(?y.of(y,x))(u);q(u))))For both cases, we apply some simple post-processing rules to the output of the parser to ob-tain the required derivations.
The effect of theserules is reported in the next section, where we as-sess the accuracy of the semantic representationsproduced for superlatives by comparing the auto-matic analysis with the gold standard.5 EvaluationThe automatic analysis of superlatives we presentin the following experiments consists of two se-quential tasks: superlative detection, and compar-ison set determination.The first task is concerned with finding a su-perlative in text and its exact span (?largest?,?most beautiful?, ?10 biggest?).
For a found stringto to be judged as correct, its whole span must cor-respond to the gold standard.
The task is evaluatedusing precision (P), recall (R), and f-score (F), cal-culated as follows:P = correct assignments of ctotal assignments of cR = correct assignments of ctotal corpus instances of cF = 2PcRcPc+RcThe second task is conditional on the first: oncea superlative is found, its comparison set mustalso be identified (?rarest flower in New Zealand?,?New York?s tallest building?, see Section 2.2).
Aselected comparison set is evaluated as correct ifit corresponds exactly to the gold standard anno-tation: partial matches are counted as wrong.
As-signments are evaluated using accuracy (numberof correct decisions made) only on the subset ofpreviously correctly identified superlatives.For both tasks we developed simple baselinesystems based on part-of-speech tags, and a moresophisticated linguistic analysis based on CCGand DRT (i.e.
the system described in Section 4).In the remainder of the paper we refer to the lattersystem as DLA (Deep Linguistic Analysis).5.1 Superlative DetectionBaseline system For superlative detection wegenerated a baseline that solely relies on part-of-speech information.
The data was tagged usingTnT (Brants, 2000), using a model trained on theWall Street Journal.
In the WSJ tagset, superla-tives can be marked in two different ways, depend-ing on whether the adjective is inflected or modi-fied by most/least.
So, ?largest?, for instance, istagged as JJS, whereas ?most beautiful?
is a se-quence of RBS (most) and JJ (beautiful).
We alsochecked that they are followed by a common orproper noun (NN.
*), allowing one word to oc-cur in between.
To cover more complex cases,we also considered pre-modification by adjectives(JJ), and cardinals (CD).
In summary, we matchedon sequences found by the following pattern:[(CD || JJ)* (JJS || (RBS JJ)) * NN.
*]This rather simple baseline is capable of de-tecting superlatives such as ?100 biggest banks?,?fourth largest investors?, and ?most important14element?, but will fail on expressions such as?fastest growing segments?
or ?Scotland ?s lowestpermitted 1995-96 increase?.DLA system For evaluation, we extrapolatedsuperlatives from the DRSs output by the system.Each superlative introduces an implicational DRScondition, but not all implicational DRS condi-tions are introduced by superlatives.
Hence, forthe purposes of this experiment superlative DRSconditions were assigned a special mark.
Whiletraversing the DRS, we use this mark to retrievesuperlative instances.
In order to retrieve the orig-inal string that gave rise to the superlative interpre-tation, we exploit the meta information encoded ineach DRS about the relation between input tokensand semantic information.
The obtained string po-sition can in turn be evaluated against the goldstandard.Table 4 lists the results achieved by the base-line system and the DLA system on the detectiontask.
The DLA system outperforms the baselinesystem on precision in all sub-corpora.
However,the baseline achieves a higher recall on the Excitequeries.
This is not entirely surprising given thatthe coverage of the parser is between 90?95% onunseen data.
Moreover, Excite queries are oftenungrammatical, thus further affecting the perfor-mance of parsing.Table 4: Detection of Attributive Superlatives, re-porting P (precision), R (Recall) and F-score, forWSJ sections, extracts of the Glasgow Herald,TREC questions, and Excite queries.

Both use thesame match on sequences of part-of-speech tagsdescribed above.
For Baseline 1, the beginningof the comparison set is the first word followingthe superlative.
The end of the comparison set isthe first word tagged as NN.
* in that sequence (thesame word could be the beginning and end of thecomparison set, as it often happens).The second baseline takes the first word afterthe superlative as the beginning of the comparisonset, and the end of the sentence (or question) as theend (excluding the final punctuation mark).
Weexpect this strategy to perform well on questions,as the following examples show.Where is the oldest synagogue in the United States?What was the largest crowd to ever come see Michael Jordan?This approach is obviously likely to generate com-parison sets much wider than required.More complex examples that neither baselinecan tackle involve possessives, since on the sur-face the comparison set lies at both ends of thesuperlative adjective:The nation?s largest pension fundthe world?s most corrupt organizationsDLA 1 We first extrapolate superlatives from theDRS output by the system (see procedure above).Then, we exploit the semantic representation to se-lect the comparison set: it is determined by the in-formation encoded in the antecedent of the DRS-conditional introduced by the superlative.
Again,we exploit meta information to reconstruct theoriginal span, and we match it against the goldstandard for evaluation.DLA 2 DLA 2 builds on DLA 1, to which it addspost-processing rules to the CCG derivation, i.e.before the DRSs are constructed.
This set of rulesdeal with NP post-modification of the superlative(see Section 4).DLA 3 In this version we include a set of post-processing rules that apply to the CCG derivationto deal with possessives preceding the superlative(see Section 4).DLA 4 This is a combination of DLA 2 andDLA 3.
This system is clearly expected to per-form best.Results for both baseline systems and all versionsof DLA are shown in Table 5On text documents, DLA 2/3/4 outperform thebaseline systems.
DLA 4 achieves the best per-formance, with an accuracy of 69?83%.
On ques-tions, however, DLA 4 competes with the base-line: whereas it is better on TREC questions, itperforms worse on Excite questions.
One of theobvious reasons for this is that the parser?s model15Table 5: Determination of Comparison Set ofAttributive Superlatives (Accuracy) for WSJ sec-tions, extracts of the Glasgow Herald, TREC andExcite questions.

Addi-tionally, as noted earlier, Excite questions are of-ten ungrammatical and make parsing less likely tosucceed.
However, the baseline system, by defini-tion, does not output semantic representations, sothat its outcome is of little use for further reason-ing, as required by question answering or generalinformation extraction systems.6 ConclusionsWe have presented the first empirically groundedstudy of superlatives, and shown the feasibility oftheir semantic interpretation in an automatic fash-ion.
Using Combinatory Categorial Grammar andDiscourse Representation Theory we have imple-mented a system that is able to recognise a superla-tive expression and its comparison set with highaccuracy.For developing and testing our system, we havecreated a collection of over 3,000 instances of su-perlatives, both in newswire text and in naturallanguage questions.
This very first corpus of su-perlatives allows us to get a comprehensive pictureof the behaviour and distribution of superlatives inreal occurring data.
Thanks to such broad viewof the phenomenon, we were able discover issuespreviously unnoted in the formal semantics liter-ature, such as the interaction of prenominal pos-sessives and superlatives, which cause problemsat the syntax-semantics interface in the determina-tion of the comparison set.
Similarly problematicare hyphenated superlatives, which are tagged asnormal adjectives in the Penn Treebank.Moreover, this work provides a concrete wayof evaluating the output of a stochastic wide-coverage parser trained on the CCGBank (Hock-enmaier and Steedman, 2002).
With respect tosuperlatives, our experiments show that the qual-ity of the raw output is not entirely satisfactory.However, we have also shown that some sim-ple post-processing rules can increase the perfor-mance considerably.
This might indicate that theway superlatives are annotated in the CCGbank,although consistent, is not fully adequate for thepurpose of generating meaningful semantic repre-sentations, but probably easy to amend.7 Future WorkGiven the syntactic and semantic complexity ofsuperlative expressions, there is still wide scopefor improving the coverage and accuracy of oursystem.
One obvious improvement is to amendCCGbank in order to avoid the need for postpro-cessing rules, thereby also allowing the creationof more accurate language models.
Another as-pect which we have neglected in this study butwant to consider in future work is the interac-tion between superlatives and focus (Heim, 1999;Gawron, 1995).
Also, only one of the possibletypes of superlative was considered, namely the at-tributive case.
In future work we will consider theinterpretation of predicative and adverbial superla-tives, as well as comparative expressions.
Finally,we would like to investigate the extent to whichexisting NLP systems (such as open-domain QAsystems) can benefit from a detailed analysis ofsuperlatives.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Steve Pulman (for in-formation on the analysis of superlatives in theCore Language Engine), Mark Steedman (for use-ful suggestions on an earlier draft of this paper),and Jean Carletta (for helpful comments on anno-tation agreement issues), as well as three anony-mous reviewers for their comments.
We are ex-tremely grateful to Stephen Clark and James Cur-ran for making their parser available to us.
