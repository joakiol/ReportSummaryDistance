Tutorial Abstracts of ACL 2012, page 3,Jeju, Republic of Korea, 8 July 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsTopic Models, Latent Space Models, Sparse Coding, and All That: Asystematic understanding of probabilistic semantic extraction in largecorpusEric XingSchool of Computer ScienceCarnegie Mellon UniversityAbstractProbabilistic topic models have recentlygained much popularity in informational re-trieval and related areas.
Via such mod-els, one can project high-dimensional objectssuch as text documents into a low dimen-sional space where their latent semantics arecaptured and modeled; can integrate multiplesources of information?to ?share statisticalstrength?
among components of a hierarchicalprobabilistic model; and can structurally dis-play and classify the otherwise unstructuredobject collections.
However, to many practi-tioners, how topic models work, what to andnot to expect from a topic model, how is it dif-ferent from and related to classical matrix al-gebraic techniques such as LSI, NMF in NLP,how to empower topic models to deal withcomplex scenarios such as multimodal data,contractual text in social media, evolving cor-pus, or presence of supervision such as la-beling and rating, how to make topic mod-eling computationally tractable even on web-scale data, etc., in a principled way, remain un-clear.
In this tutorial, I will demystify the con-ceptual, mathematical, and computational is-sues behind all such problems surrounding thetopic models and their applications by present-ing a systematic overview of the mathemati-cal foundation of topic modeling, and its con-nections to a number of related methods pop-ular in other fields such as the LDA, admix-ture model, mixed membership model, latentspace models, and sparse coding.
I will offera simple and unifying view of all these tech-niques under the framework multi-view latentspace embedding, and online the roadmap ofmodel extension and algorithmic design to-ward different applications in IR and NLP.
Amain theme of this tutorial that tie together awide range of issues and problems will buildon the ?probabilistic graphical model?
formal-ism, a formalism that exploits the conjoinedtalents of graph theory and probability theoryto build complex models out of simpler pieces.I will use this formalism as a main aid to dis-cuss both the mathematical underpinnings forthe models and the related computational is-sues in a unified, simplistic, transparent, andactionable fashion.3
