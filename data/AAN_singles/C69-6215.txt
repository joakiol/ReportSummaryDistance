Reinhart Herzog (IBM Germany):Computational Studies in Terminology(Abstract of a Paper to be Presented at the 1969International Congress on Computational Linguistics,SAnga S~by, Sweden)Terminology, as a field of applied linguistics, is gainingincreasing importance, since in recent years striking newdevelopments of technology and the sciences have takenplace.
Terminologists have their own international congresses;linguists and standard associations try to build up andcontrol the specific vocabularies of all different fields,in order to have them compiled and printed in up-to-datedictionaries.
Industry also shows remarkable interest inthis work, because those great international companiesheav i ly  depend on the means of a fixed and standardizedvocabulary in order to achieve the necessary communication(to go along with its products), either by publication orby translation.For various reasons, the task of documenting and controllingthe growth and structure of terminological vocabulariescannot satisfactorily be accomplished without the applicationof computers.
Insight into the structure of terminologieshas been gained by functional~ computer prepared statisticsof vocabularies and validations of texts.
Linguists, fortheir part, have programmed computers in order to isolaterelevant lexical items from terminological texts~ as wellas to determine the various meanings and shades of meaningof specific terms~ by means of special procedures.Several linguistic methods and procedures~ as originallydeveloped for automatic sentence analysis and mechanicaltranslation~ can successfully be employed in the fieldof computer assisted research and control of terminologiesThis holds especially true with regard to automatedcompilation procedures, as to be used within the processof preparing bilingual and multil ingu~l technical dictionaries.~f20
