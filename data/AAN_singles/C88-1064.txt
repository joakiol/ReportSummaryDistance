One obviousdifficulty is its nonconcatenative nature ie.
the fact thatinflection :is not just adding prefixes and suffixes, but alsoi~tcludes interdigitation where the phonological sequence3ymbolizh~g a verbal root is interrupted by individual andshort sequences ofphonemes denoting various derivationaland inflectional stems.
\]fn addition to this, there are~xumerou~ phonological nd raorphophonological processesof a more conventional character.Two-level phonology assumes a framework for word-formation ~vhere there is an underlying lexical representa-tion of the word-form and a surface representation whichare related to each other with two=level rules \[Kosken-nien~ J983\].
These rules compare the representationsdirectly a~ld they operate in parallel The lexicon compo-rxent deth.~.es what lexical representations are permissibleand how they correspond to sequences of morphemes, eefigure 1.MORPHEMES1It exicon ComponentIILEXiCAL ~EPRESENTATI ONIITwoAevel RulesIISI.IRIFACE IiEPRESENTATIONFig.

The rule component proves to be similari~ two-level rule systems ~br other la~guages.Interdigitation entails more requirements for the lexiconwhich defines feasible lexical representations and relatesthem to underlying morphemes..The task for the lexiconcomponent is more or less universal, even if somelanguages can do with simpler lexicons while othersrequire more sophisticated structures.This paper discusses a solution which involves using twoseparate lexicons, one for word roots, and the other forprefixes, flexional elements and suffixes.
Entries for rootsleave flexlonal elements unspecified and vice versa.
Theintersection ofthese two lexicons effectively defines lexicalrepresentations of word-forms.2.
Morphotactic structure of word-forms.Akkadian verbs have the following overall pattern:\[pers.\] \ [ root & f lect ion\]  \ [gender  & numb.\]  \ [opt.
subjunct ive etc.\] \[opt.
obj.\]An example of a full fledged verbal form would be '(that)they caught him':l ex ica l representat ion :  I X t a B A T - u \ - n I - sh usurface representat ion :  i x x a b t u u n i sh uA dash '-' denotes morpheme boundary, and backslash 'V amorphophoneme for vowel lengthening.
The above word-form is divided into its parts according to the pattern asfollows:person 1root  X ... B ... A Tf lect ion ... t a .

.gender  & number  u \subjunct ive n 1object  sh uCapital letters are used in order to distinguish radicalconsonants and vowels fi'om segments in other morphs.Thus, the root & flection part is XtaBAT where capitalletters are components of the root, with lower case lettersrepresenting flectional elements.Nouns, in turn, have an overall structure :\ [stem\] \[case & number \ [  \ [opt.
possessive\]An example of a maximal nominal word-form is theirkings ~.l ex ica l representat ion :  Sh a R \ - a \ n t - sh  u n Usurface representat ion :  sh a r r a a n i sh u n u313This can be readily decomposed into its parts as follows:stem Sh a It \case&number  a \ n ipossessive sit u n u3.
Overa l l  s t ruc ture  of  morphsVerbal roots have an overall pattern of three radicalconsonants and one vowel c ... C ... v c where flectionalelements may occur in the two intervening slots markedwith "..."Flectional elements have a pattern consisting of twoparts to fill the corresponding two gaps in the verbal root.The overall pattern is roughly ...(((c)C)v)...(v or \)...There is at most one verbal prefix and it indicates person(and partly modus).
Its overall l  pattern is (C)y.There are at most three verbal suffixes attached to thestem.
The first suffix indicates gender and number (andpartly person).
They have the form v\ or they are empty.The second suffix indicates either the subjunctive (u,empty, or n-l) or the ventive (am or aim).
The third suffixdenotes the object or the dative case and conforms to apattern c v( c u ( \  c v))Nominal stems are given as derived complete stemscontaining three radical consonants which can beidentified, but no attempt has been made to generate themfrom plain radical consonants and flectional elementsbecause stems are idiosyncratic and better described aslexicalized whole units.Nominal suffixes indicate gender, number and case.Gender is part of the stem for nouns whereas adjectiveshave an explicit feminine suffix (a)t (the masculine has nomarking).
Number and case are represented by port-manteau morphs.
After these endings there may be apossessive nding according to one of two patterns: v k orc v (c v).3.
Phono log ica l  Descr ip t ionAkkadian, like many other Semitic languages, has aconsiderable number of phonological and morphophono-logical processes.
This paper describes a fairly completeand tested system of some 30 rules written in two-levelformalism and compiled with the TWOL rule compiler\[Karttunen, Koskenniemi and Kaplan, 1987\].
A number ofexamples is given below accompanied by rules thatcorrespond to the processes.
In each example the lexicalrepresentation is given (in bold face) above the surfacerepresentation (in normal face).There are several assimilations word internal ly and atmorpheme boundaries, eg.
an N in the root is assimilatedto the immediately following consonant, eg.
