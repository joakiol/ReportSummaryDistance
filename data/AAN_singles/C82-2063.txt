~danova 12, 103 777 Moskva GSP, SSSRAll systems of automatic text processing are explicitlyor implicitly based on two general linguistic ~ssumptlons:the assumption o~ grammatioallty of the texts processed, andthe assumption of their meaningfulness.
These assumptions,however, cannot be considered as absolute laws: It is not un-oommon that a text, thongh acceptable to most speakers of thecorresponding language, still contains some morpholoEicand/or syntactic lngrammatlcalitles or cannot be completelyInterpreted In terms of "standard" semantics; and conversely,startlng from an acceptable (meaningful) semantic structureone may as often as not fail to find fully "grammatical"language means that could express thls structure wlth absoluteaccuracy (one of the usual translation difficulties).
Thls Asdue, f~om our po in t  of view, not on ly  to Incompleteness ofl ingu is t i c  and ext ra l lngu ls t l c  knowledge of  separate  peopleor to  Imper fect ions  In  the corresponding formal models, butalso to the following two fundamental principles of Ilnguls-t i c  performance:I) a large number of ~equlrementa on lexico-gremmatic(superficial) manifestation of natural-language texts, andon their semantic Interpretation, are relative In that theycharacterize certain manifestations or Interpretations as moreor  less normative (preferable) in the given conditions, ratherthan obligatory vs. Inadmissible In the absolute sense;- 255 -2) the in teract ion  between the requ i rements  of grammat-I ca l  and semantic normat iv l ty  of texts  adheres to a so~ of~omDlementarlt,7 principle: if the basic meaning of a textfragment is supposed by Its author to be sufficiently trans-parent or known apr lo r i  to the text  addressee,  the grammatlc-allty requirement for this fragment*s surface manifestationmay be somewhat s lackened;  i f  on the cont rary ,  the authorbe l ieves  the text  to conta in  much Important  In fo rmat ion  newto the addressee,  the language ru les  used in  composing i t ssurface manifestation are apt to be as standard and rigid aspossible.In  th i s  p resentat ion  we In tend  to descr ibe  one Way ofincorporat ing  the above pr inc ip les  in  the des ign  of  theana lys i s  and synthes is  (generat ion)  components of an automat-Ic translation system.The general structure of the system viewed from thisstandpoint Is planned to be as follows.The major pert of factual linguistic Anformatlon Isformulated in the system regardless of the tasks of analysisor synthesis.
It is shaped principally as a set of descript-ive rules arranged into dictionary and grammar according tothe so-called lexlco~aphlc principle and classified into twomaln types: the context-representation rules making up thecontextual dictionary and grammar component, and the context--contrastlvs rules forming the Inter-contextual grammar.The rules of both types describe the possible superficialmanifestations and semantic Interpretations for elementarypotent ia l  components of  text  s t ruc ture .

In terms of such rules onecan stats all those particulars of the surface and/or semanticarrangement of natural-language texts (or of a special t~peof texts) whAoh involve a kind of overall stylistic comparison,ra ther  than the proper t ies  of I nd iv idua l  l ingu is t i c  un i t s  ands t ruc tura l  features .- 257 -The descr ip t ive  par t  of the system i s  made operat iona l  bymeans of spec ia l  cont ro l  components ac t ing  as "p lanners"  ofthe ana lys i s  and Synthes is  processes .

In asmuch as this aspect of processing Is concerned, the approachaccepted makes It possible to re-lnterpret the well-known ideaof "analysis through synthesis" and "synthesis through analy-s is" from the "normetlvlty" angle of vlew.
Thus, for analysisone can reduce this Idea to a formalization of the followlngllne of reasoning (quits popular with translators or peoplesomehow concerned with texts In foreign languages): "Express-ion X in the text at hand cannot mean Y because had the authormeant Y he would have much rather used expression Z".Apart from a f fo rd ing  bet ter  p rocess ing  accuracy ande f f i c iency ,  exp l i c i t  in t roduct ion  of data on normat lv l ty  andpre ferab i l i ty  of  l ingu is t i c  un i te  and features  throughout a l lthe major components of  a text  p rocess ing  system, and drawingon s ta t i s t i ca l  character i s t i cs  of LS -un i ts"  contextua l  mani-fes ta t ions  and in terpretat ions  as the cont ro l l ing  fac tor  Inse lec t ing  the more "promising" among the a l te rnat ive  routes  ofp rocess ing  concrete  texts ,  seems to have one more asset .Name\]y, poss ib i l i t i es  are opened up fo r  automat ica l ly  per fec t -?r~ the sys tem's  funct ion ing  when requ i red ,  and ta i lo r ing  I tto d i f fe rent  text  s ty les ,  by way of modi fy ing the pr io r i tyIcoef f i c ients  of the l ingu is t i c  ru les  Invo lved , d i rec t ly  fromthe cur rent  resu l t s  of  the sys tem's  operat ion .- 258  -
