UsingBBN VALAD:Speech at the Logistics AnchorDeskMade l ine  Bates  and  Rusty  BobrowBBN Systems and Technolog ies70 Fawcet t  S t reetCambr idge ,  MA 02138BBN has developed a system, called VALAD (Voice-Activated Logistics An-chor Desk), which provides a spoken language interface to a logistics informationsystem.
Logistics experts can use their natural voice to ask for different ypesof information or to control the display of the logistics system.
The informationis displayed on a map or appears in tabular form, as is appropriate.
The voiceinterface is seamless in that the user can choose to use either voice or the tra-ditional keyboard and mouse interface.
However, the use of voice often allowsthe user to short-cut many mouse clicks with a single query or command.
The1200-word VALAD is speaker independent, and runs completely in software onoff-the-shelf workstations.VALAD was developed by BBN under the sponsorship of DARPA, the De-fense Advanced Research Projects Agency, to demonstrate the applicability ofadvanced speech recognition and language understanding technology to realisticdata base tasks.
By enabling users to specify information in the database in nat-ural English, VALAD supports applications such as military planning processesand enhances decision-support environments.A formal experiment with VALAD (conducted by Major T. Bowman at theCommand and General Staff College at Ft. Leavenworth) concluded that userscould perform routine tasks in 1/3 the time using speech, compared to using thekeyboard and mouse.
The users, all Army personnel, also thought hat speechwould reduce training time because it was so easy to use.VALAD was used at the Integrated Feasibility Demonstration at the JDEFin Washington DC in June, 1996.
VALAD was also used in the Prairie Warrior'96 military exercise at Ft. Leavenworth in May 1996.35
