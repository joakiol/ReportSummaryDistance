Academ~ 1982Towards a mechan ica l  analys is  of French tense forms in texts.Chr is t ian RohrerUn ivers i t~t  Stut tgar tI)In this paper we want  to present  a system that analyzes tenseforms and temporal  adverbs in texts 2) .
For reasons of ex-pos i t ion we restr ic t  the analys is  to narrat ive  texts.The system compri.
:es the fo l lowing components:a) A parser  which ass igns a tree structure to sentences.The f ragment which the parser  can analyse corresponds roughlyto the f ragment of Eng l i sh  descr ibed by R. Montague in 'Theproper t reatment  of quant i f i ca t ion  in ord inary  Engl ish' .
Ourf ragment conta ins  however  more tense forms, temporal  adverbs,and temporal  conjunct ions.
In part icu lar  we treat  the notor ious-ly d i f f i cu l t  pair of tense forms pass~ simple and imparfait ,frame adverb ia ls  l ike aujourd'hui ,  hier, demai____~n,ce lour - l~  , u_nn~our  plus tard, etc.
,as wel l  as the .zonjunctions quand,pendant~\[u_e,depuis que,a r ~ ~ .b) The syntact ic  analys is  const i tutes  the input to the rules thatder ive the cor respond ing  d iscourse representat ions.
The syntac-tic s t ructure detezmines the d iscourse representat ion.Let D = S i .

The reduct ion  of a sentenceS i p roceeds  through the app l icat ion  of certa in DRS-con-st ruct ion rules which  operate on the syntact ic  ana lys is  of thesentence and work so to speak ' from the top down' (thus thesyntact ic  analys is  imposes a part ia l  order on how the rulesare to be appl ied).What DRS-const ruct ion  rule is to be appl ied depends on thepar t icu lar  syntact ic  format ion rule that was used to form thesyntact ic  compound that the appl icat ion of the rule is to re-duce.
Where one of the immediate components  of the compound isa s ingular  term, moreover,  the choice of const ruct ion  rulewi l l  be determined by the type of this term; thus, for in-stance there is a d i f ferent  rule for proper  names, for inde-f in ite descr ip t ions  and for pronouns, xespect ive ly .
S imi lar lythere are d i f ferent  rules for each of the tenses cons ideredhere.331332 CH.
ROHRERc) In o rd inary  t ru th -cond i t iona l  semant ics  truth cond i t ions  arestated for ind iv idua l  sentences:  A d iscourse  cons is t ing  of aset of sentences is true iff it cons ists  of noth ing but truesentences.
The order  in wh ich  the ind iv idua l  sentences occurin the d i scourse  is i r re levant  for the t ruth condit ions.
Inthis sys tem truth condi t ions  are fo rmulated  for a sequenceof sentences D = $I, .

, S n in such a way that theorder  in wh ich  the sentences occur  in the text p lays acruc ia l  role.
The t ruth of a d iscourse  D in a mode l  M is de-f ined as the ex is tence  of a proper  embedd ing  into M of therepresentat ion  of D.A major  advantage of the present  system l ies in its ab i l i ty  todeal  w i th  cases of in tersentent ia l  and in t rasentent ia l  anaphorain exact ly  the same fashion.
Tense  forms and tempora l  adverbs be-have in many respects  l ike anaphor ic  pronouns.
The DRS-con-s t ruct ion  ru les  handle  both tempora l  and pronomina l  anaphora.
Thesystem ext racts  al l  the tempora l  in format ion  wh ich  is conta inedin the input text.
A t  a later stage the in format ion  ext ractedf rom the text wi l l  form the bas is  for a quest ion  - answer ingsystem.
An implementat ion  of the system on a VAX 780/11 is inprogress.1) The work  repor ted  in this paper  was suppor ted  by theDeutsche  Forschungsgemeinschaf t  grant  Ro 245/12.2) The system is based on the fo l lowing papers:  Kamp, H.
