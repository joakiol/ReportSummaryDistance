ANAPHORA RESOLUTION: SHORT-TERM MEMORY AND FOCUSINGRAYMONDE GUINDONMicroeleotronlcs  and Computer Technology Corporat ion(MCC)9430 Research Blvd.Austin, Texas ?8759.ABSTRACT INTRODUCTIONAnaphora resolut ion is the process ofdetermining the referent of ~uaphors.such as def in i te noun phrases andpronouns, in a discourse.
Computat ionall inguists, in model ing the process ofanaphora resolution, have proposed thenot ion of focusing.
Focusing is theprocess, engaged in by a reader, ofselect ing a subset of the discourseitems and maJ?ing them highly avai lablefor further computations.
This paperprovides a cognit ive basis for anaphoraresolut ion and focusing.
Human memoryis d iv ided into a short-term, anoperating, and a long-term memory.Short-term memory can only contain asmall number of meaning units and itsretr ieval time is fast.
Short-termmemory is d iv ided into a cache and abuffer.
The cache contains a subset ofmeaning units expressed in the previoussentences and the buffer holds arepresentat ion of ~he incoming sentence.Focusing is real ized in ~he cache thatcontains a subset of the most topicalunits and a subset of the mos~ recentunits in the text.
The in format ionstored in the cache is used to integrate~he incoming sentence with the precedingdiscourse.
Pronouns should be used torefer to units in focus.
Operat ingmemory contains a very large number ofunits but its re~rleval t ime is slow.It contains the previous tex~ units thatare not in the cache.
It comprises thetex~ units not in focus.
Def in i te nounphrases should be used to refer to unitenot in focus.
Two empir ical  studies aredescr ibed that demonstrate the cognit ivebasis for focusing, the use of def in i tenoun phrases to refer to antecedents notin focus, and the use of pronouns torefer to antecedents in focus.The goal of thls research is toshow the relat ion between thepsychologica l  work on anaphorareso lut ion based on the notion of al imited short-term or working memory andthe computat ional  l inguist ics work basedon the notion of focusing.This rapprochement is important forthe fol lowing reasons:I) From a theoret ical  viewpoint.cognit ive evidence increases theval id i ty  of the computat ional  notion offocus.2) Focusing corresponds to one of thereader's comprehension processes and itneeds to be incorporated in the model ofthe user in language understandingsystems to adequately resolveam~iguit les  in the user's utterances andto handle language generation.FOCUSING IN COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICSAccording to Grosz (1977) .
who wasinterested in ~he resolut ion of def in i tenoun phrases, focusing is the process.engaged in by part ic ipants in adiscourse, of h ighl ight ing a subset oftheir shared reality.

Joshi.
and Weinstein furtherdef ine the notion of centering.
Eachsentence has two types of centers whosepurpose is to  integrate the sentence tothe discourse.
The backward- look ingcenter l inks the current sentence to thepreceding discourse.
The set offorward- looklng centers provides th~ setof ent it ies to which further anaphorsm~y refer.
The b6okw~rd- looklng centercorresponds, roughly.- to Sidner's focusand the forward- looklng centers  toSidner's potentla~l fool.~8?
LOne principle der ived by Grosz,Joshl, and Weins~ein is the following:if the b~okward- looking center of theourren~ utterance is the same as thebaokward- looklng cen~er of the previousutterance, a pronoun should be used.
Inother words, if there are no ~oplcshifts, continue to refer to the sameentity by using a pronoun.However, violat ions of- thispr inciple have been presented in Grosz(1977) and noted in Grosz, Joshl, andWelns~eln (198~).
They have shown thatpronouns are sometimes used to refer toentit ies mentioned many sentences back,even though the backward- looklng centerof intervening sentences has beenchanged by topic shifts.Sidner (19V9.
1983) has proposedthe notion of focus in the context ofinterpreting anaphors, especial lypronouns.
In Sidner's theory, ananaphor neither refers ~o another wordnor co-refers to another word.
butrather co-specif ies a cognit ive elemen~in the reader's mind.
Moreover.
atheory of an&phora resolution mustpredict the pattern of reader's correctand incorrect choices of co-specif iersand ~he fai lures ~o unders tand .
Thisview makes explicit the considerat ion ofthe reader's mental model andinferential capa~bili~iesA sEetch of Sidner's focusingprocess follows.
First.
an init ialfocus is selected on the basis ofsyntactic features and thematic rolesindicating toplc~l ity in the flrs~sentence.
Other elements introduced inthe sentence are stored as potentialloci for later sentences.
When ananaphorlc expression is encountered.this focus is tested as a co-speclf lerfor ~he anaphor.
It has to satisfysyntaotlo res~rlo~ions on co-references(L~snlk, 1976), semantic seleo~ionalrestr lo~ions (Katz and Fodor, 1963), andpragmatic plausibi l i ty  oons~raln~sexpressed in the remainder of thesentence.
If the focus fails ~s aco-speclf ier for the ~n~phor, thepotential  fool are tr ied in turn.
Atthe same time, the new elementsintroduced in the sentence are stored aspotential  loci for later sentences.Third, the focus is updated to theselected co-speclf ler for the anaphor.If the focus has changed, a topic s~ifthas occurred.
The second and thirds~eps are cycl ical ly applied after eachsentence.The advantage of using a focusmechanism is tha~ it priorlt lzes andrestr lc~s the search for a co-speclfier,and as a consequence, reduces theoomputat lon~l costs assoolated withinferent ia l  processing when test ln~ theappl icabi l i ty  of the oo-specl f ler  to theanaphor.COGNITIVE STUDIES OF ANAPHORA RESOLUTIONA few representat ive empiricalstudies of anaphora resolut ion aredescr ibed below.
All the experimentalpar~dlgms used share the fol lowingassumptions:1) human memory is func~ional ly ors~ruc~ural ly  div ided into at least twotypes of memories, a short-term memorywith small storage capacity but veryfast retrieval time and a long-termmemory with very large s~orage capacitybut slow retrieval time:2) a topic shift transfers the unitscurrently in short-term memory tolon~-term memory:3) ~n anaphor transfers its referentfrom long-term memory to short-termmemory (i.e.
reinstates its referent),if it was not already in short-termmemory.The first assumption is crucial.Other things being equal, computationsinvolving retrieval from short-termmemory will be faster than thoseinvolving retr ieval from long-termmemory.
Turning to the secondassumption, topic shifts have been foundto be induced wlth a varify ofl inguls%ic devices.
One of the devicesis the introduct ion of interveningsentences between the referent and itsanaphor.
The intervening sentences areunrelated zo the referent but related tothe overall  text.
Another device is thespeci f icat ion of a temporal or Spatialparameter that is outside the normalrange of a situation.
When descr ibing adinner, the phrase "Five hours later,"signals ~h~t the topic of conversat ionis no longer the dinner.
Another deviceis the use of an anaphor, frequently adef ln l te noun phrase, to refer to anantecedent tha~ is not current ly thetopic of conversat ion bu~ is in the"background".
Finally, there is the useof key phrases to signal a diversion inthe flow of discourse, such as "Let'sturn to.".
as documented in Relchman(1978, 1984).The general pattern for thematerial used in these experiments isthe following.
A~ the beginning of thetex~ appears a sentence containing areferent (e.g.
biologist).
Forexample, "The mission included abiologist".
Then, if ~he referentshould not be in focus, the nex~sentence or sentences indloate a topicshift as described aJ3ovs (e.g.~9unrelated intervening sentences).
Ifthe referent should be in focus, nodevices for topic shifts are used.
Thefol lowing sentence then contains anan&phor (e.g.
scientist, he) to thefocused or non-focused referent (e.g.biologist).
For example, "The scientlstcol lected samples from the cultures".Another example is shown in Table 1 ofthis paper.Carpenter and Just (1977) used eyetraoklng with other convergingtechniques to study anaphora resolution.Wlth eye tracking, one can monitor veryprecisely the trajectory of the eyes,with their forward and regressivemovements, and the duration of eyef ixations on small segments of the te~.The assumption behind using thistechnique is that eye movements areclosely related to higher levelcognit ive activit ies such ascomprehension.
Therefore.
one canexpect longer f ixation durations on textsegments requir ing addit ional processingto be comprehended and one can expectthe eye movement pattern to mirror theselect ive pickup of importantinformation in the text.They performed a series ofexperiments testln~ the effect ofrecency of a referent on the time courseof anaphora resolution.
Indirectly.they tested the effect of recency on theavai labi l i ty of an item in short-termmemory.
They presented texts where thenumber of sentences between the referentand the anaphor was varied from zero tothree.
The subjects read each sentenceand.
after the sentence, had to decidewhether it was consistent orinconsistent with the previoussentences.
The consistency Judgmenttimes and the eye fixations wererecorded.
The consistency Judgmenttask, used as converging evidence withthe eye movement technique, is bel ievedto induce the subjects to integrate eachnew sentence and should pars,llel thedi f f iculty of ~phora  resolution.
Theoverall  reading time of the ~n&phorlosentence was measured using the eyetracking technique.
Each of these tasksshould be faster if the referent was inshort-term memory than if the referentwas in long-term memory.Response times for the consistencyJudgments and reading times of theanaphorlc sentences increased as then-mher of intervening sentencesincreased.
The sharpest differenceappeared between zero and oneintervening sentence.
Gaze durationswithin the anaphorlo sentence wereshorter when there were no intervenlngsentences th~n in the other conditions.These results show not only that&naphora resolut ion is easier when thereferent is nearer the ~naphor but alsothat one intervenln E sentence may besuff lolent to produce a topic shift.C lare and Sengul (1979) used thesentence reading time technique to studyanaphora resolution.
In this technique.subjects control the onset and offset ofthe presentat ion of a sentence bypressing a button.
The subjects areinstructed to press the button to see anew sentence as soon as they haveunderstood the current sentence.
Theassumption behind this technique is thataddit ional  processing required forcomprehension wil l  increase sentencereading time.Clare and Sengul (1979) measuredthe reading time of a sentencecontaining an anaphor.
Theyd ist inguished between two models of theeffect of recency of a referent on thespeed of ~naphora resolution.
In thefirst model, cal led the "continuitymodel", entit ies mentioned in thediscourse are searched backward from thelast one.
One should expectmonotonical ly  increasing re~din~ time asthe searched entity is farther back.
Inthe second model, cal led the"discontinuity model", entit iesmentioned in the current or lastsentence are kept in short-term memoryand accessed first.
All the entit iesthat are further back are more l ikely tobe in long-term memory (and not inshor~-term memory) and accessed second.Subjects rea~ short paragraphswhere a referent could be separated fromthe anaphor by zero ~o two intervenin~sentences.
The readln~ time of ~hesentence containing the anaphor was fastwhen the referent was in the immediatelypreceding sentence but ~a l lx  ~ whenit was two or three sentences before.This f inding supports the discont inuitymodel.
Entit ies in the last processingcycle are more l ikely to be kept inshort-term memory than entit ies inpreviously processed cycles.
Once atex~ entity is not in short-term, thenumber of intervening sentences does notaffect the speed of an~phora resolution.Lesgold, Roth, and Curtis (1979),who related the l inguistic notion offoregrounding (Chafe, 1972) to ~hepsychological  notion of short-termmemory, performed a series ofexperiments similar ~o those of Clark~nd Sengul (1979), using more variedways to produce topic shifts, andrepl icated the above findings.220McKoon and gatol i f f  (1980) used anact ivat ion procedure based on Chang(1980).
A desor ipt lon of the basloparadigm and its underlying loglofollows.
When one reads a text, only asmall part of the text information isstored in short-term memory and most ofthe informat ion is stored in long-termmemory.
This is due to the very smallstorage capacity of short-term memory (7t2 chunEs; Miller, 1956).
Given thatretr ieval  time in short-term memory ismuch faster than retr ieval time inlong-term memory, it wil l  tame longer toremember something from the text if thememory is stored in long-term memorythan in short-term memory.In their study, subjects read aparagraph sentence by sentence.Immediate ly  after the last sentence, thesubjects were presented with a singleword and the subjects had to rememberwhether the word had appeared previouslyin the text or not (an old-newrecognition).
If the tested word wasstil l  in short-term memory, the old-newrecognit ion time should be faster thanif it was in long-term memory.To test this hypothesis, theparagraphs were constructed in thefol lowing manner.
The referent (e.g.burglar) was separated from the anaphorby either zero or ~wo in~ervenlngsentences.
The anaphor appeared in thelast sentence of the paragraph.
Thelast sentence was presented in one ofthree versions: i) the subject of thesentence was a repetit ion (i.e.burglar) of the referent in the firstsentence (anaphorio- identioal);  2) thesubject was the name of the category-(e.g.
criminal) in which the referentbelonged (anaphorlc- category); 3) thesubject was a noun (e.g.
ca~) unrelated~o the referent (non-anaphoric).
Duringthe experimental  trials, the "referent"(i.e.
burglar) was presentedimmediately after the last sentence foran old-new recognition.Assuming that an anaphor activatesits referent by making it avai lable inshort-term memory, one can expects lgni f loant ly faster old-new recognit iont imes for "burglar" in theanaphor lc-ca~egory oondi~lon than in thenon-anaphor lo condition.
Thispredict ion was observed.Surprisingly, the number ofintervening sentences did not have aneffect.
This suggests that the twointervening sentences did not remove thereferent from short-term memory (i.e.
"backgrounds" the referent).
It isprobably not the case.
Rather.
i~ isl lkely that by testing the referent atthe end of the clause, as opposed towhen the anaphor is encountered, thereferent had time to be reinstated inshor~-term memory and be highlyavailable.
This is an important point.The act ivat ion procedure was not on-l lnesince the old-new recognit ion ocoured atthe ~n~ of the sentence as opposed toM~ll~ the sentence was read and theanaphor encountered.Another in i t ia l ly  surpr is ing effectwas that ~he old-new recognit ion timesfor the referents were slower in thezero intervening sentences when theanaphor was a repet it ion of the referentitself  than when the anaphor was thecategory name.
This last resultsuggests that it is not appropriate touse a def in i te noun phrase, especial ly arepet i t ion of the referent, to refer toa antecedent in short-term memory.As explained previously,intervening sentences are not the onlydevices that transfer text units fromshort-term to long-term memory.Stereotypical  s ituations have spatialand temporal parameters with legalranges of values.
If one specif ies aspatial or ~emporal value outside theseranges, a scenario-shift  occurs.
Forexample.
Anderson (in Sanford andGarrodo 1981) constructed texts aboutstereotypical  s ituations such as goingto a restaurant.
In one sentence of thetext, there was a reference to acharacter related to the script, say awaiter.
AZ the beginning of the nextsentence, there was a mention of atemporal or spatial  parameter, such as"One hour later" or "Five hours la~er".In the flrs~ case the parameter iswithin the range def in ing the scrip~, inthe second case it is not.
The rest of~he sentence contained an anaphor to thepreviously ment ioned character, thewalter.
Measumlng ~he reading time ofthe anaphorlo sentence.
Anderson showedlonger reading time when the spatial ortemporal parameter w~s outside the rangeof the script th~n inside.
Thissuggests that the referent wastransfered from short-term to long-termmemory by the scenarlo-shlft  and it tooklonger ~o retrieve the referent duringanaphora resolution.The results from all theseexperiments support the notion tha~ ananaphor activates its referent by maltingit highly available in short-term memoryand ~hat topic shifts transfer unitsfrom short-term memory to long-termmemoz'y.
However.
none of these studles~except some eye movement siudles.provide data on ~ anaphora resolutionoccurs during the reading of a sentence~nd when i~ ooou2s in relat ion to the2~lexioal, syntactic.pragmatic  analyses.semantic, andCOGNITIVE BASIS FOR FOCUSINGA sketch of a cognit ive model ofanaphora resolut ion is offered here.
Ithas been  heavi ly  inf luenced by theshort-term~long-term memory model ofK intsch and van DiJk (19~8) andespecia l ly  its leading edge strategy.~tructure ~f ~ memg/~Analogical ly, human memory can beconceptual ized as a three levelstructure similar to the memory of mostmini and main frame computers.
Itconsists of a small, very fast memorycal led short-term memory (STM); arelat ively larger main or operatingmemory (OM): and a vast store ofgeneral  world knowledge cal led long-termmemory (LTM).The total STM is only large enoughto contain 7t2 chunks of information atany one time (Simon, 1974; Miller.1956).
The resources for STM aredynamical ly  al located to one of twouses.
First, par~ of the STM is used tostore the incoming sentence or clause.This is a temporary storage of thesentence or clause before furtherprocessing and is cal led the STM buffer.The second part of STM is cal led the STMcache.
It is used to hold over.
fromone sentence or clause to the next.
theinformation necessary to provide localand global coherence.
It contains asubset of the previous text items thatare topical and a subset of those thatare recent.
Retr ieval  t imes fromshort-term memory are very fast.Conceptually.
operating memory isthe subset of the world knowledge inlong-term memory which is deemedrelev~n~ to the prooesslng of thecurrent par~ of the text.
It alsocontains the growing memory structureoorrsspondin~ to the tex~ read so f~r.I~ contains the less topical  and lessrecent information from the text.Retrieval times are much longer than forshort-term memory.The time course of anaphoraresolution is greatly determined by thecurrent content of shor~-term memory andof operating memory.
Moroever, pronounsand definite noun phrases are resolvedusing different s~rategies.Cache ~ .
During the inputof a sentence into the buffer ~nd theconcurrent integrat ion of the sentenceinto the cache, a subset of the semanticunits  held in the STM is selected to beheld over in the cache for the nextcycle.
Fol lowing Elntsch and van Di jk(1978), the cache management strategyselects a subset T of the most topicali tems and a subset R of the most recentitems to be held over in the cache.
Theselect ion strategy aims at m~xlmiz in~the probabi l i ty  that an anaphor in thenex~ sentence wil l  refer to a semanticunit held in the cache.
Cachemanagement is appl ied after eachsentence or clause.Pronouns and def inite noun phrases areresolved using different strategies, wewil l  descr ibe four cases:i.
The anaphor is a def in i te nounphrase and the referent is notin focus, that is, i~ is inoperating memory,2.
The anaphor is a def inite nounphrase and the referent is infocus, that is.
it is in thecache.3.
The anaphor is a pronoun andthe referent is in the cache(in fOCUS).4.
The anaphor is a pronoun andthe referent is in operatingmemory (not in focus).It is hypothesized that theexpl ic i tness of sm anaphor is a signal.used by the readier, which denoteswhether the referent is in the cache orin operating memory.If the ~naphor is a def in i te nounphrase, operating memory is searchedimmediately.
If the referent is inoperat ing memory it is then reinstatedinto the cache.
A topic shift hasoccured.If the anaphor is a definite nounphrase and the referent is in focus(i.e.
in the cache), anaphoraresolut ion wil l  be hindered.
The readersearches operating memory while thereferent is in short-term memory.Correspondingly.
this violates a rule ofcooperat ive communication: use adef inite noun phrase to refer to an~ntecedent not in focus.
The def ini tenoun phrase signals a topic shift, whilein fact.
the same entity is being talkedabout.999If the anaphor is a pronoun, thecache is searched for a plausiblereferent.
If found, mnaphora resolutionis completed.
Because cache managementis based on topioal l ty and recency,pronouns can refer to ~he main ~opio of~he text even when the main ~opio hasno~ been mentioned directly for mamysentences.
Unless there is a global~opic shift, the main topic in the cacheremains unchanged throughout ~he text.If the anaphor is a pronoun but noreferent is found in the cache, it isthen necessary to search operatingmemory.
If a referen~ is found inoperating memory, it is reinstated intothe c~che.
A ~opic shift has occured.Using a pronoun ~o refer ~o informationin operating memory is de~rlmental  ~oamaphora resolution.
The reader firstsearches the cache.
~hen ~he operatingmemory, and ~hen has ~o relnst~te ~hereferent into the cache.COMPARISONSA clear relation exists between ~henotion of focusing proposed incomputational l inguist ics and the modelof human memory and discourse processingproposed in cognit ive psychology.The Q~h~ is used to store theitems in f.~Q~.
Given the small numberof items stored in the cache, a sketchyanaphor such as ~ ~ is sufflclen~to retrieve the referent.
The cachemanagement strategy in human .memory isaimed at maximizing ~he probabi l i ty thatthe cache contains the informationrelevant to the next cycle ofcomputation.
The cache, by containingtopical and recen~ i~ems, allows tomaintain global and local coherence.Q ~  m~y~ is used ~o storeitems that are not in f~A~.
Becausethe set of items is large, aninformative descr lp~ion of the Item ~obe searched for is needed.
D~f i~ i~~ou~ ~h/~es  a/e used ~o indlc~te to thereader ~ha~ the i~em is no~ in focus.thus In operating memory.
Other thingsbeing equal, it will tame more time toretr ieve an item from operating memorythan from the cache.
The referent willneed to be reinstated into the cache.This will produce a topic shift.
Thereinstated referent is then highlyavai lable and can be referred to byusing a pronoun.TWO ON-LINE STUDIES OF ANAPHORARESOLUTIONThe presented studies test thenot ion tha~ focus is cognlt ivelyreal ized in the reader's l imitedshort - term memory.

and Welnsteln's  claim thatdef in i te  noun phrases, and not pronouns,should be used to refer ~o items nolonger in focus and ~hat pronouns, ~ndnot def in i te noun phrases, should beused to refer to items in focus.Moreover, if one assumes that thecontent of short-term memory isdynamica l ly  updated on ~he basis ofrecency ~nd topicality, one can explainwhy pronouns can be used to refer Zorecent items ~nd also to topicalnon-recen~ items.A new technique, cal led Q~z l i~~ i Q n ,  was developed speci f ical lyto provide the empir ical  da~a for thesestudies.
The on-l ine act ivat iontechnique can be compared to "closely"tracing the execution of ~ program.In the on-l ine act ivationtechnique, passages are presented usingrapid serial visual presentat ion (RSVP),one  word a~ a time.

We will call ~hese special lymarked words zest words.
This task iscal led am old-new recognit ion task.The passages contained anaphorsreferr ing ~o antecedents which wereeither in focus or not in focus.
Anantecedent was removed from focus byintroducing a topic shift, with ~herestr lc~ion that the antecedent was notthe main topic of the discourse.

Atsome point before or after the anaphorwas presented on the CRT, its referentwas presented for old-new recognit ionand recognit ion times and errors werecollected.
The delay between the onse~of the anaphor and the onset of the testword is called the stimulus onsetasynchrony (SOA).
The ~naphor is actingas a prime, which should activate thereferent.
The old-new recognit ion timefor the referent test word indicates223whether the referent is in the cache orin operating memory.TABLE 1EXAMPLE OF TEXTS WITH ANTECEDENTSIN FOCUS AND NOT IN FOCUSAntecedent: thermometerAnaphor: instrumentAntecedent in Focus1- The assistant was preparingsolut ions for a chemistry experiment.2- The experiment would take at leastfour hours.3- There would then be a ten hour waitfor the react ion to complete.4- He measured the temperature of asolut ion using a thermometer.5a- The thin instrument was not givingthe expected re~ding.5b- A broken instrument was not givingthe expected reading.5c- The compuzer terminal was not givingthe expected reading.Antecedent not in FocusI- The assistant was preparingsolutions for a chemistry experiment.2- He measured the temperature of asolut ion using a thermometer.3- The experiment would take at leastfour hours.4- There would then be a ten hour w~itfor the react ion to complete.5a- The thin instrument was not givlngthe expected reading.5b- A broken instrument was not givingthe expected reading.50- The computer terminal was not givingthe expected reading.In addition, there were three typesof primes, as shown in sentences 5a, 5b,8~d 5o in Table i.

The two condit ions S?R-and S-R- were control condit ions toseparate the effect of semantic priming,due ~o semantic ~ssociat ion between theanaphor and the referent, on the old-newreccgnlt lon for referents.A schema of the procedure is shownin Table 2.

(~sec)Recogn i t ion  la~enc ies  a~ eachSOA for a referent  in focus.225In another study (Gulndon, 1982),using ~he same on-l lne ~c~iva~iontechnique, the ~c~ivation of anantecedent by a pronoun was ~raced.
Inthis study, it was fo%L~d tha~ referring~o an anteceden~ not in focus by using apronoun was detr imental  to anaphoraresolution.
The delay between readingthe anaphor and reins~atlng thean~eceden~ was as long as 2400 msec.The act lva~ion of an anteceden~ no~ infocus by a pronoun takes a long ~imebecause ~he reader is induced: I) tosearch the cache unsuocesful ly; 2) tosearch operating memory with a "sketchy"pronoun: 3) to relnstaZe the referentinto the cache.
Act ivat ion wasimmediate for ~he antecedents in focus.As opposed ~o the previous s~udy wherereferr ing to a focused referen~ using adef inite noun phrase hindered anaphoraresolution, no such effect was observedwhen using a pronoun.
This is expectedsince pronouns signal tha~ ~he referentis in the cache.SUMMARYThe notion of focusing and thenotion that the form of the anaphorsignals whether ~he referen~ is in focusor no~ have cognit ive support.
Items infocus are items in the cache which isdynamical ly  updated ~o contain ~he Tmost ~opical and the R most recen~ itemsin the ~ex~.
Because the cache con~alnsfew items, pronouns should be used ~orefer to items in focus.
O~her thingsbeing equal, anaphora resolut ion wil l  beeasier if the antecedent is in focus,because ~he retrieval ~imes from thecache are much faster ~han those fromthe operating memory.
Antecedents notin focus are in operating memory.
I~emsno~ in focus are in operating memory.
Adef inite noun phrase, because it is moredescr ipt ive ~han a pronoun, should beused to re~rieve the ~nteceden~ from ~helarge set of i~ems in operating memory.However, because ~he reErleval ~ime isslow in opera~in~ memory, anaphoraresolut ion is more dlf f lcul~ for i~ems~ha~ are no~ in focus.
Therelns~a~emen~ of am an~eceden~ into ~hecache effects a ~oplc shift.The on-llne activation ~echniquewas developed specif ical ly to provideempir ical  data on the no~ion of focus.The ~dvan~age of this technique overconventional memory experiments is thatone can ~est precisely the ~emporalpropert ies of various analyses andprocesses occurring durln~ sentence andter~ comprehension.
This technique canbe used to dist inguish between differentmodels of anaphora resolution when ~hesemodels are no~ easi ly dist inguished onthe basis of discourse or dialoguean~iysls.REFERENCESCarpenZer, P.A.
