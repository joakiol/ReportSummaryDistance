A l f red  Hoppe of  Forschuugsgruppe L IMAS has  deve loped a pro  - /cedure  for  a revers ib le  data  f low (F igure  I).
'In the matr ix /%hree  ~ -d i f fe rent  quant i t ies  are connected  together .
For  ana lys i s~hegrammat ica l  descr ip t ion  of  an in f lec ted  fo rm is determined  bycombin ing  the in f lec t ion  c lass  w i th  the ending.
For  example  theGerman verb  ~ehen is composed of the s tem ~eh and the end ing  e_~u.The lex icon  te l ls  us that  ~eh be longs  to in f lec t ion  c lass  B. Bycombin ing  the channe ls  of  in f lec t ion  c lass  B and  the end ing  e__u.u / - .we are ab le  to determine  the grammat ica l  descr ip t ion  of  the v ~  L?
)(wh ich  is in this case ambiguous  ) .
Each  of  these groups  conta ins ,  ~a ser ies  of  b inary  var iab les  whose  va lue  is e i ther  zero or  one.The synthes is  p rocess  un i tes  the channe ls  w i th  the grammat ica lvar iab les ,  the resu l t  be ing  the appropr ia te  ending.The matr i ces  conta in  on ly  "and" and  "or" gates  and  an e lementwh ich  can b lock  the f low in one d i rec t ion ,  as cer ta in  l ingu is t i cforms w i l l  be ana lyzed  but  not  syuthes ized .
Techu ica  l~ l i zed ,  ~the matr ix  d~sp lays  an example  of  para l le l  p rocess ing  wh ich  isboth  complex  as we l l  as rapid.For  the present  t ime the L IMAS sys tem wi l l  be programmed for  con-vent iona l  computers ,  wh ich  operate  more  or less  sequent ia l l y .Thus programming such  a matr ix  invo lves  s imu la t ing  this  para l le ldata  f low on a sequent ia l l y  operat iug  mach ine .
One must ,  however ,take into  cons iderat ion  that  this  w i l l  resu l t  in an increase  ofrunn ing  t ime.
But  for  purposes  of  tes t ing  whether  or not  the enddata  have  been cor rec t ly  combined  to de l iver  the f ina l  resu l tthis t ime increase  is i r re levant .Bes ides  the para l le l  p rocess ing  one must  a lso cons ider  revers i -b i l i ty .
We have  d i scovered  that  revers ib i l i ty  has not  made pro -g ramming more  d i f f i cu l t ;  on the cont rary ,  it  has  fac i l i ta ted  theprogram debugg ing  process .At  f i r s t  the matr i ces  w i l l  be programmed to f low on ly  in the d i -rec t ion  of  synthes is .
For  aha lys i s  one wou ld  have  to wr i te  everyposs ib le  form of  a la rge  number  of  words  on punch  cards  in o rderto test  a l l  the var ia t ions .
This ,  o f  course,  wou ld  requ i re  animmense  amount  of  work.
It is a g reat  dea l  s imp ler  to let  thecomputer  p r in t  out the in f lec ted  forms,  and then check  the outputto see i f  they are correct .
The feature  of  revers ib i l i ty  thusmakes  it  poss ib le  to test  both  d i rec t ions ,  i.e.
ana lys i s  and  syn-thes is ,  at the same time.- I -.8- 2 -I wou ld  l i ke  to d i scuss  br ie f ly  var ious  procednres  wh ich  fac i l i -tate the s imu la t ion  process .
A l l  descr ip t ive  categor ies  such  ascase, numbe~,  person ,  etc.
are coord inated  w i th  the var ious  en-d ings .
The prob lem is there fore  to compute  the combined  va lues  o fcer ta in  b inary  var iab les  f rom the combined  va lues  o f  cer ta ino ther  b inary  var iab les .

I t  is obv ious  that  each  l ine  o f  such  al i s t  canbe  s tored  in one or  more  mach ine  words .It  is necessary  to have  a program wh ich  w i l l  encode  end ings ,  in -f l ec t ion  c lasses ,  and grammat ica l  in fo rmat ion  in b i~-combina-, i ons ,  and  a search  program wh ich  can locate  the respect ive  b i t -combinat ions  in the l ist ?
For  ana lys i s  the su f f i x  b i tpat te rnand in f lec t ion  c lass  b i t  pat te rn  are g iven,  and  the l i s t  issearched  for  the l ine  in wh ich  they  are s tored ?
Th is  l ine  a l soconta ins  the grammat ica l  b i t  pat te rn ,  the ob jec t  o f  the search .The resu l t s  can be pr in ted  out  w i th  the he lp  of  a decod ing  pro -gram, or e lse they  can remain  encoded and be processed  at  ah igher  leve l  in the~ystem.
The synthes is  p rocess  is s imi la rexcept  that  the grammat ica l  b i t  pat te rn  is g iven  in p lace  o f  thesu f f i x  b i t  pat te rn .
The su f f i x  b i t  pat te rn  is then the ob jec t  o fthe search.The l i s t  method  has the advantage  that  necessary  expans ions  orchanges  can eas i ly  be car r ied  out  dur ing  the deve lop ing  s tagesw i thout  a f fec t ing  the ac tua l  p rogram.Another  p rogramming poss ib i l i ty  resu l t s  f rom a fo rmula - l i kerepresentat ion ?
A l l  var iab les  of  a l ine  in the l i s t  are  to beconsecut ive ly  indexed ?
(a 1, a 2, ..., a n )Wi th  the a id  o f  log ica l  funct ions  (e.g.
the Boo lean  fu l l  form)i t  is poss ib le  to represent  the process  in the fo l low ing  way:a i ~ F i (a I, a 2, ..., a n ) i = 1,nfA search  procedure  is no longer  necessary .
Ins tead ,  as manylog ica l  equat ions  w i l l  be computed  as there  are var iab les ?
Ofcourse  the var iab les  w i l l  have  to remain  stored?
unt i l  the f ina lresu l t  is ava i lab le .
It  is poss ib le  to obta in  these  fo rmula -l i ke  representat ions  automat ica l ly  f rom the l i s ts ,  and to auto --3 -~mat ica l ly  min imize  the obta ined  fo rmulas ,  i .e.

It should also beposs ib le  to annex extra hardware such as Dr. Hcppe's  matr ix.Wired search and sort ing programs would also Me pract ical .With this sketch of some technical  aspects of data process ing  Ishall c lose my remarks.
