Coling 2010: Poster Volume, pages 561?569,Beijing, August 2010A Logistic Regression Model of Determiner Omission in PPsTibor Kiss Katja Ke?elmeier Antje M?ller Claudia Roch Tobias Stadtfeld Jan Strunk Sprachwissenschaftliches Institut,  Ruhr-Universit?t Bochum {tibor, kesselmeier, mueller, roch, stadtfeld, strunk}@linguistics.rub.de  Abstract The realization of singular count nouns without an accompanying determiner in-side a PP (determinerless PP, bare PP, Preposition-Noun Combination) has re-cently attracted some interest in computa-tional linguistics.
Yet, the relevant factors for determiner omission remain unclear, and conditions for determiner omission vary from language to language.
We pre-sent a logistic regression model of deter-miner omission in German based on data obtained by applying annotation mining to a large, automatically and manually annotated corpus.
1 The problem and how to deal with it Preposition-Noun Combinations (PNCs, some-times called determinerless PPs or bare PPs) minimally consist of a preposition and a count noun in the singular that ?
despite requirements formulated elsewhere in the grammar of the re-spective language ?
appears without a deter-miner.
The noun in a PNC can be extended through prenominal modification (1) and post-nominal complementation (2).
Still, a determiner is missing.
The following examples are given from German.
(1) auf parlamentarische Anfrage (?after being asked in parliament?
), mit beladenem Ruck-sack (?with loaded backpack?
), unter sanfter Androhung (?under gentle threat?)
(2) Er wehrt sich gegen die Forderung nach  he defies REFL against the demand for  Stilllegung einer Verbrennungsanlage.
closedown an  incineration plant ?He defies the demand for closing an inciner-ation plant.
?PNCs occur in a wide range of languages (Himmelmann, 1998); the conditions for deter-miner omission, however, have not been detected yet, and conditions applying to one language do not carry over to other languages.
In addition, speakers only reluctantly judge the acceptability of newly coined PNCs, so that reliance to intro-spective judgments cannot be assumed.
For English, Stvan (1998) and Baldwin et al (2006) have claimed that either the semantics of the preposition or of the noun play a major role in determining whether a singular count noun may appear without a determiner in a PNC.
Stvan (1998) assumes that nouns determine the well-formedness of PNCs (3) if the denotation of the noun occurs in a particular semantic field, while Baldwin et al (2006) assume that certain prepositions impose selection restrictions on their nominal complements that allow for deter-miner omission (4).
(3) from school, at school, in jail, from jail, ?
(4) by train, by plane, by bus, by pogo stick, by hydro-foil ?
Interestingly, Le Bruyn et al (2009) have ob-served that basic assumptions of Stvan?s analysis do not apply to Dutch, French, or Norwegian.
With regard to German, we observe that neither the pattern in (3) nor in (4) is productive.
Con-structions like (4) cannot be realized as PNCs in German, but require full PPs.
In the following, we propose an analysis of PNCs that combines corpus annotation, annota-tion mining (Chiarcos et al, 2008), and logistic regression modeling (Harrell, 2001).
Annotation mining assumes that linguistically relevant gen-eralizations can be derived in a bottom-up fash-ion from a suitably annotated corpus.
Relevant hits in the corpus are mapped into a feature vec-tor that serves as input for logistic regression classification.
In the present case, the input con-561sists of sentences containing either PNCs or PPs.
Binary logistic regression suggests itself as a classification method since the problem of PNCs can be rephrased as the following question: Un-der which conditions can an otherwise obligatory determiner be omitted?
The majority of required annotations can be derived automatically, but there are no available systems for the automatic determination of preposition senses in German, so preposition sense annotation has to be carried out manually and requires a language-specific tagset for prepo-sition senses.
While our initial analysis is based on German data, the general methodology can be applied to other languages, provided that corpora receive proper annotation.
2 Corpus annotation 2.1 General characteristics  The present analysis is based on a newspaper corpus of the Swiss-German newspaper Neue Z?rcher Zeitung from 1993 to 1999, comprising approx.
230 million words.
The annotation is based on an XML-stand-off format.
MMAX2 (M?ller and Strube, 2006) is used for manual annotation.
Annotations are carried out both for PNCs and for full-fledged PPs.
For each prepo-sition, the following data is considered: PNCs, where N is a count noun; corresponding PPs with the same count noun; and PPs containing count nouns not appearing inside PNCs.
The following annotations are provided for each dataset in the corpus: Lexical level: part-of-speech, inflectional morphology, derivational morphology of nouns, count/mass distinction of nouns, interpretation of nouns, interpretation of prepositions, noun com-pounding.
Syntactic level: mode of embedding of the phrase (adjunct or complement), syntactic de-pendents of the noun, modification of the noun.
Global level: Is the phrase contained in a headline, title, or quotation?
Is the phrase idio-matic?
Headlines, titles, and quotations are par-ticularly prone to text truncation and PNCs oc-curring here might not be the result of syntactic operations.
Similarly, idiomatic PNCs and PPs might follow combination rules that differ from the general modes of combination.
Hence, theannotations may serve to exclude these cases from general classification.
2.2 Automatic annotation  The following tools are employed for automatic annotation: Regression Forest Tagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008) for POS tagging and morpho-logical analysis (the tagger contains the SMOR component for morphological analysis, cf.
Schmid, 2004), and Tree Tagger (Schmid, 1995) for chunk parsing.
To determine noun meanings, we make use of two resources.
The first resource is GermaNet (Kunze and Lemnitzer, 2002), the German ver-sion of WordNet.
We employ 23 top-level cate-gories, and each noun is annotated with every top-level category it belongs to.1 Secondly, we use the computer lexicon HaGenLex (Hartrumpf et al, 2003), which offers specific sortal infor-mation derived from a formal ontology for each noun.
Finally, we employ a classifier for the count/mass distinction.
The classifier combines lexical statistics, expressed in terms of a decision tree classifier, with contextual information, which is handled by Na?ve Bayes classification (cf.
Stadtfeld 2010).
The classification is based on the fine-grained distinctions first introduced in Allan (1980), but we employ a reduced set of five instead of eight classes.
The classifier is type-based as it makes use of the relation be-tween singular and plural realizations of noun lemmas, but takes the immediate context of the lemma into account.
Nouns are only assigned to a particular class if both classifiers come to the same result w.r.t.
this class assignment.
While this leads to some nouns being excluded from the count/mass dis-tinction, the resulting classes show a high degree of precision.
2.3 Manual annotation of preposition senses Prepositions are highly polysemous.
What is more, the relation between a preposition and its senses has to be determined in a language-                                                1 Nouns that are assigned to more than one top-level cate-gory are presumably homonymous or polysemous.
We do not disambiguate the nouns.
The reason is that individual features will be evaluated for their effect in a logistic model, and an ambiguous noun will receive a value in each feature.
Hence, we can be sure that a significant semantic feature will be included in the classification.562specific manner.
While the Preposition Project forms a basis for preposition sense annotation in English (cf.
Litkowski and Hargraves 2005, 2007), little attention has been paid to specialized annotation schemata for preposition senses in German, which form the first prerequisite for a classification of preposition senses.
Based on four usage-based grammars and dic-tionaries of German (Duden 2002, Helbig and Buscha 2001, Durrell and Br?e 1993, Schr?der 1986), we have developed an annotation schema with a hierarchical structure, allowing for sub-trees of preposition senses that require a fine-grained classification (such as TEMPORAL, SPA-TIAL, CAUSAL, and PRESENCE).
For temporal and spatial interpretations, the annotation is further facilitated by the use of decision trees.2  Altogether, the annotation schema includes the following list of top-level categories: MODAL, CAUSAL, PRESENCE, SPATIAL, TEMPORAL, STATE, COMITATIVE, AGENT, REDUCTION/EXTENSION, PARTICIPATION, SUBORDINATION, RECIPIENT, AFFILIATION, CORRELATION/INTERACTION, TRANSGRESSION, ORDER, THEME, SUBSTITUTE, EXCHANGE, COMPARISON, RESTRICTIVE, COPU-LATIVE, ADVERSATIVE, DISTRIBUTIVE, STATE-MENT/OPINION, CENTRE OF REFERENCE, and RE-ALISATION.
Based on an extension of the weighted kappa statistic we have reached an overall kappa value (?w) of 0.657 and values between 0.551 and 0.860 for individual features (cf.
M?ller et al 2010a).
Two properties of the annotation schema prohibit the application of a standard kappa sta-tistic: First, the schema allows subsorts, and sec-ondly, a preposition may receive more than one annotation if its sense cannot be fully disambigu-ated.
The values reported in M?ller et al (2010) for maximal subtypes such as SPATIAL (?w = 0.709) and TEMPORAL (?w = 0.860) can be equated to aggregate values in standard kappa statistics.
In the models presented below, we employ top-level categories only and have aggregated more specific sense annotations.2 The schema does not directly distinguish between local and directional senses, but makes use of cross-classification to deal with the distinction.
Cf.
M?ller et al (2010b).3 Preparing logistic regression models for ohne (?without?)
and unter (?un-der?, ?below?)
The problem of PNCs, i.e.
why a determiner is omitted in a construction which otherwise re-quires the realization of the determiner, can be rephrased as a problem for binary logistic regres-sion and classification.
While binary logistic regression does not pro-hibit monocausal explanations, typical models for binary logistic regression employ more than one factor, and the value of the coefficients mod-els the relative influence of the individual fac-tors.
Logistic regression thus does not only help to identify factors for determiner omission, but also reveals the interplay of multiple licensing conditions ?
thus possibly accounting for the relative difficulty to distinguish acceptable from inacceptable PNCs.
We are aiming at a description of PNCs in German for the 22 prepositions listed in (5).
(5) an, auf, bei, dank, durch, f?r, gegen, gem?
?, hinter, in, mit, mittels, nach, neben, ohne, seit, ?ber, um, unter, vor, w?hrend, wegen These prepositions have been chosen on the basis of the following two assumptions: a) they appear in PNCs and PPs, and b) their ?typical?
object is an NP.
We present logistic regression models of de-terminer realization for two prepositions: ohne (?without?)
and unter (?under?, ?below?).
The first preposition, ohne, is the only preposition that appears more often in PNCs than in PPs.
The second preposition, unter, belongs to the class of highly polysemous prepositions.
In fact, it is the preposition with the second largest number of senses (10 senses), only surpassed by mit (?with?)
(11 senses), which however appears much more often than unter in the corpus and thus requires further annotation.
The following table summa-rizes the distribution of PNCs and PPs for both prepositions, after tokens that had been annotated as belonging to headlines, quotations, telegram style sentences, or as being idiomatic were ex-cluded from the data.
With regard to the first group (headlines etc.
), the elimination mostly applies to PNCs, but among the PPs we found many idiomatic expressions and fixed phrases, which have also been excluded from modeling.563Preposition ?
PP PNC ohne 3,750    591  3,159 unter 5,181 4,334     857  Table 1.
Data Distribution of PNCs and PPs   The analysis has been carried out in R (R De-velopment Core Team, 2010) and makes exten-sive use of Harrell?s DESIGN package (Harrell, 2001).
The feature vector consists of the dependent variable ?
the factor DET with its levels no and yes ?
and of relevant classificatory features rep-resenting the interpretation of the preposition (in terms of the features presented in section 2), the internal syntactic structure of the nominal projec-tion (prenominal modification of N, syntactic arguments of N, internal structure of N as a com-pound, derivational status of N), the external syntactic embedding of the PNC or PP, and the interpretation of the noun.
Features starting with DEP signify syntactic arguments of the noun (DEP-S a sentential com-plement, DEP-NP an NP complement, etc.
); the feature ADJA signifies the presence of one or more modifying adjectives; the feature COM-POUND indicates whether the noun in question is a compound.
The feature GOVERNED indicates whether a noun or a verb governs the phrase.
The feature NOMINALIZATION provides information about the derivational structure of the noun, in particular it indicates whether a noun is derived from a verb by use of the suffix ?ung.
Features starting with GN are GermaNet top-level categories, features starting with HL are HaGenLex ontological sorts; both describe the interpretation of the noun.
The statistical modeling started with the as-sumption that each feature is relevant, so that an initial feature set of 92 features was considered.
Feature elimination took place through fast backwards elimination (Lawless and Singhal, 1978) and manual inspection.
The results of fast backwards elimination were not followed blindly.
Following Harrell?s (2001:56) suggestion, we have kept factors despite their low significance levels.
In most cases, however, manual inspec-tion and fast backwards elimination suggested the same results.
The resulting models were sub-jected to bootstrap validation to identify possible overfitting (cf.
section 5.1).The value DET = no is taken to be the default value in the following models.
As a consequence, negative values for coefficients indicate rising probability for an omission of a determiner, while positive coefficients shift odds in favor of a realization of the determiner.
4 Logistic models for the omission of a determiner with ohne and unter The logistic regression models developed for the prepositions ohne and unter make use of 13 and 22 features, respectively.
In each case, we have started with a full model fit (Harrell, 2001:58f.
), evaluated the full model and eliminated factors through manual inspection and fast backwards elimination.
The coefficients for the models for ohne and unter are reported in tables 2 and 3.

Model Quality.
4.1 The model for ohne Starting with the model in table 2, we can iden-tify several groups of factors:The first group comprises the interpretation of the preposition.
The group discriminates between determiner omission and realization.
The seman-tic features CAUSAL, COMITATIVE, and PARTICI-PATION show positive coefficients, suggesting that prepositions receiving the aforementioned interpretations tend to favor an ?ordinary?
NP including a determiner.
The interpretation PRES-ENCE, on the other hand, shows a negative coef-ficient and thus suggests the omission of a de-terminer.
There are further senses of ohne, which do not have a significant effect on determiner omission/realization.
Turning to the representation of syntactic ar-gument structure of the noun, we find that the coefficients of DEP-S, DEP-NP, and DEP-PP re-ceive positive values throughout.
The presence of syntactic complements thus shifts odds in fa-vor of determiner realization.
There is a strong preference against determiner omission with DEP-S, and somewhat weaker values for Dep-NP and Dep-PP, respectively.
A comparison of in-terpretation and complement realization offers a general assessment of PNCs.
As ohne and unter share only a few senses, we do not necessarily expect that the discerning senses relevant for a realization of a PNC with ohne carry over to un-ter; but we do expect that features pertaining to the syntactic structure of the nominal comple-ment play a role not only for ohne, but for unter (or for prepositions admitting PNCs in general) as well.
And this prediction is actually borne out in the model for unter.
The model thus already offers interesting insights not only w.r.t.
the re-alization conditions of PNCs and PPs headed by ohne, but for broader analyses of PNCs as well.
We will return to the role and value of the fea-tures ADJA and NOMINALIZATION in section 4.3.
The last group comprises the semantic charac-teristics of nouns derived from GermaNet.
If a noun is classified as belonging to the relevant GermaNet top-level categories, determiner omi-ssion is favored.
4.2 The model for unter A first glance at the model for unter shows that it requires a larger set of predictors than the model for ohne.
In part, this is due to the higher degree of polysemy of unter: with more senses, we ex-pect more semantic predictors to enter the dis-crimination.
In addition, a wider range of senses565also allows for a wider range of selection restric-tions, and hence for a larger number of different sortal specifications for selected nouns.
The higher complexity of the model, however, should not conceal a peculiarity of this model that casts serious doubt on the idea that PNCs are mono-causally licensed by particular senses of a prepo-sition: the model selects five senses from the ten top level interpretations of unter, but the coeffi-cients are unsigned.
Thus, the model indicates that the senses SPATIAL, CAUSAL, SUBORDINA-TION, ORDER, and TRANSGRESSION block the omission of a determiner.
What we do not find are senses that favor the omission of a deter-miner.
The features DEP-S, DEP-NP, and DEP-PP again favor the realization of a determiner.
A comparison of the coefficient of DEP-S to the coefficients of DEP-NP and DEP-PP shows, how-ever, that the presence of a sentential comple-ment has a strong influence on determiner reali-zation, while NP- and PP-complements may still occur in PNCs, as their coefficients are relatively low (also in comparison to the coefficients of these values for ohne).4  In more general terms, we suspect a general mechanism relating sentential complementation to the realization of the determiner, a topic to be addressed in future research.
It should also be noted that the external syn-tactic realization of the phrase plays a role for unter.
The feature GOVERNED did not play a role for ohne, but suggests the realization of a deter-miner for unter.
The reason might be that few verbs or nouns govern the preposition ohne.
Prepositional objects headed by unter, however, are more common.
Prepositional objects headed by ohne make up only 1.2 % of the occurrences of ohne in the present corpus, while the share of prepositional objects headed by unter is three times larger: 3.6 %.
Finally, we note that a variety of sortal classi-fications for nouns suggest either an omission or realization of the determiner, supporting the as-                                                4 One could argue against the inclusion of the coefficient for DEP-PP altogether, as it does not seem to be significant (p > 0.05) in the first place.
However, we have followed Har-rell?s (2001) advice that blind exclusion of seemingly insig-nificant factors may not lead to model improvement.
In fact, models for unter including Dep-PP outperform models ex-cluding this feature.sumption that in addition to the preposition?s meaning, the meaning of the noun plays a role.
GermaNet top-level categories were already dis-criminating in the model for ohne; but the model for unter also makes use of HaGenLex sortal categories (HL-AD and HL-AS).
The predictors stand for dynamic and static concepts that both receive an abstract interpretation.
Their inclusion is particularly interesting, as it is sometimes claimed (e.g.
Bale and Barner, 2009) that ?ab-stract?
nouns are never to be classified as count nouns.
4.3 General assessment of the models  Both models show that the realization of syntac-tic complements, of sentential complements in particular, seems to impede determiner omission.
That syntactic complexity does not seem to play a role per se, can be deduced from the coeffi-cients for the factor ADJA: While ADJA favors determiner realization with ohne, it prohibits de-terminer realization with unter.
The role of morphological derivation through ?ung, as represented by the factor NOMINALIZA-TION, is the same in both models: derived nomi-nals shift odds in favor of determiner omission.
While the derivational structure might be consid-ered a formal property of the construction, it might also reflect an underlying denotational dis-tinction between events and objects, which has to be clarified in future work.
It is a striking feature of the model for unter that we do not find interpretational features of the preposition unter that favor determiner omis-sion.
Taken together with the other factors in the two models presented, the analysis suggests a picture rather different from the (more or less) monocausal analyses of Stvan (1998) and Baldwin et al (2006).
With regard to unter a model in the sense of Baldwin et al (2006) could only provide negative rules of the form ?if P does not mean this, its nominal complement may be realized without a determiner?, but such a model would lead to less precision than the mul-ticausal model presented here.
5 Validation of the models 5.1 Bootstrap validation Logistic regression models may suffer from overfitting the data.
We have thus carried out a566bootstrap validation of both models and applied penalized maximum likelihood estimation (Har-rell, 2001) to the models.
The results of the ini-tial (non-penalized) models are reported in Table 5 and Table 6, where we report values for Dxy and the average maximal error of the model.
Bootstrap validation makes use of sampling with replacement.
The training samples for evaluation thus may contain certain instances many times, but some original data will never be sampled and can thus be used for testing the models.
Boot-strap validation is carried out 200 times, the re-sults being averaged.
The overfitting of the mod-els is determined by the optimism derived from the bootstrap evaluation.

5.2 Representing the influence of factors in a nomogram The respective influence of individual factors can be read of a nomogram (Banks, 1985) derived from the models presented above (we make use of a tabular presentation for reasons of legibil-ity).
The nomogram for ohne consists of the ta-bles 9 and 10.
Table 9 lists the individual scores for the factors in the model for ohne, were 0 in-dicates that the pertinent property is not present and 1 indicates that the property is present.
Table 10 maps the sum to probability of determiner omission.

(7) NOMINALIZATION = 0, ADJA = 1, PRESENCE = 1, all other senses = 0, GN-ATTRIBUTE = 1, all other GN features = 0, DEP features = 0.
Given the individual scores for the factors in table 9, the total number of points for the combi-nation in (6) is 144, leading to a probability of 0.7 that a determiner will be omitted in the con-struction.
In other words, a determiner omission is likely with the feature set given in (6).
In (7), we reach a total of 92 only, so that the likelihood of determiner omission rises above 0.9.
6 Summary and prospects The models presented support the general as-sumption that the realization or omission of a determiner in a prepositional phrase should be analyzed as a multicausal phenomenon.
The lo-gistic regression analysis presents evidence for the assumption that the senses of the preposition and the interpretation of the noun (possibly gov-erned by selection restrictions of the preposition) as well as the syntactic complexity of the em-bedded nominal projection are major factors in determining whether an article can be dropped or not.
With regard to the complexity of the nominal projection, the two models presented here indi-cate that it is not complexity per se, but that the realization of a complement of the noun, in par-ticular of a sentential complement, clearly raises the probability of article realization.
While this is a speculation, based on the models presented here, it might very well be that this dependency reflects a deeper referential requirement.
In developing further models for prepositions, we expect that the realization of a complement of the noun will establish itself as a common factor,but this has to await further research and model development.
