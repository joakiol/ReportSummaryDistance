Char_align: A Program for Aligning Parallel Textsat the Character LevelKenneth Ward ChurchAT&T Bell Laboratories600 Mountain AvenueMurray Hill NJ, 07974-0636kwc @research.att.comAbstractThere have been a number of recent papers on aligning parallel texts at the sentence l vel, e.g., Brown et al(1991),Gale and Church (to appear), Isabelle (1992), Kay and R/Ssenschein (to appear), Simard et al(1992), Warwick-Armstrong and Russell (1990).
On clean inputs, such as the Canadian Hansards, these methods have been verysuccessful (at least 96% correct by sentence).
Unfortunately, if the input is noisy (due to OCR and/or unknownmarkup conventions), then these methods tend to break down because the noise can make it difficult to findparagraph boundaries, let alne sentences.
This paper describes a new program, charal ign, that aligns texts at thecharacter level rather than at the sentence/paragraph level, based on the cognate approach proposed by Simard et al1.
IntroductionParallel texts have recently received considerableattention in machine translation (e.g., Brown et al1990), bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans andTzoukermann, 1990), and terminology research forhuman translators (e.g., Isabelle, 1992).
We have beenmost interested in the terminology application.Translators find it extremely embarrassing when"store" (in the computer sense) is translated as"grocery," or when "magnetic fields" is translated as"magnetic meadows."
Terminology errors of thiskind are all too common because the translator isgenerally not as familiar with the subject domain asthe author of the source text or the readers of the targettext.
Parallel texts could be used to help translatorsovercome their lack of domain expertise by providingthem with the ability to search previously translateddocuments for examples of potentially difficultexpressions and see how they were translated in thepast.While pursuing this possibility with a commercialtranslation organization, AT&T Language LineServices, we discovered that we needed to completelyredesign our alignment programs in order to deal moreeffectively with texts supplied by AT&T LanguageLine's customers in whatever format hey happen to beavailable in.
All too often these texts are not availablein electronic form.
And even if they are available inelectronic form, it may not be worth the effort to cleanthem up by hand.2.
Real Texts are NoisyMost previous work depends on being able to identifyparagraph and sentence boundaries with fairly highreliability.
We have found it so difficult to findparagraph boundaries in texts that have been OCRedthat we have decided to abandon the paragraph/sen-tence approach.
Figure i, for example, shows someparallel text (selected from the official record of theEuropean Parliament) hat has been processed with theXerox ScanWorX OCR program.
The OCR output isremarkably good, but nevertheless, the paragraphs aremore elusive than it might appear at first.The first problem we encountered was the missingblank line between the second and third paragraphs inthe French (Figure lb).
Although this missing linemight obscure the boundary between the twoparagraphs, one could imagine methods that couldovercome missing blank lines.A more serious problem is illustrated by two phraseshighlighted in italics in Figure 1, "PetitionsDocuments received...," and its French equivalent,"Prtittons - Drprt de documents...." When we firstread the OCR output, we found these two expressionssomewhat confusing, and didn't understand why theyended up in such different places in the OCR output.After inspecting the original hardcopy, we realizedthat they were footnotes, and that their location in theOCR output depends on the location of the pagebreaks.
Page breaks are extremely complicated.
Mostalignment programs don't attempt to deal with issuessuch as footnotes, headers, footers, tables, figures andother types of floating displays.One might believe that these layout problems could beavoided if only we could obtain the texts in electronicformat.
Perhaps o.
But ironically, electronic formatsare also problematic, though for different reasons.Figure la: An Example of OCRed English4.
AgendaPRESIDENT.
- We now come to the agenda for thisweek.SEAL (5).
- Mr President, I should like to protestmost strongly against the fact that there is no debateon topical and urgent subjects on the agenda for thispart-session.
I know that his decision was taken bythe enlarged Bureau because this is an extraordinarymeeting.
None the less, how can we be taken seriouslyas a Parliament if we are going to consider only inter-nal matters while the world goes on outside?
I wouldlike to ask you to ask the enlarged Bureau to look athow we might have extra sittings in which urgencieswould be included.Having said that o the Chair and bearing in mind thatthere are no urgencies, I should like to ask the Com-mission to make statements on two items.
First of all,what action is the Community taking to help the peo-ple of Nicaragua, who have suffered amost enormousnatural disaster which has left one-third of the popula-tion homeless?
Secondly, would Commissioner Suth-erland make a statement on the situation that has aft-sen in the United Kingdom, where the British Govern-ment has subsidized Aerospace to the tune of UKL1 billion by selling them the Royal Ordnance factoriesat a knockdown price and allowing them to asset-stripin order to get this kind of cash?

- I think you have just raised aboutfour urgencies in one them.
We cannot allow this.
Theenlarged Bureau made a decision.
This decision cameto this House and the House has confirmed it.
This isa special part-session.
We have an enormous amountof work to do and I suggest we get on with it.There are a large number  o f  di f ferent markuplanguages, convent ions,  implementat ions,  platforms,etc., many of  which are obscure and some of  which areproprietary.
In more than one instance, we havedecided that the electronic format was more troublethan it was worth, and have resorted to OCR.
Evenwhen we did end up using the electronic format, muchof  the markup had to be treated as noise since wehaven ' t  been able to bui ld interpreters to handle all ofthe wor ld 's  markup languages,  or even a largepercentage of  them.2Figure lb: An Example of OCRed French4.

Aligning at the Character  LevelBecause of  the noise issues, we dec ided to look for analternative to paragraph-based  a l ignment methods.The result ing program, chara l ign ,  works at thecharacter level using an approach inspired by thecognate method  proposed in S imard et al(1992).Figures 2 show the results o f  char_align on a sampleof  Canadian Hansard data, kindly prov ided by S imardet al along with a l ignments as determined by theirpanel of  8 judges.
S imard et al(1992) refer to thisdataset as the "bard"  dataset and their other dataset asthe "easy" dataset, so-named to reflect the fact thatthe former dataset was relatively more difficult thanthe latter for the class of alignment methods that theywere evaluating.
Figure 2 plotsf(x) as a function of x,where x is a byte position in the English text andf(x)is the corresponding byte position in the French text,as determined by char_align.
For comparison's sake,the plot also shows a straight line connecting the twoendpoints of the file.
Note that f (x )  follows thestraight line fairly closely, though there are small butimportant residuals, which may be easier to see inFigure 3.Figure 3 plots the residuals from the straight line.
Theresiduals can be computed as f (x)  - cx, where c isthe ratio of the lengths of the two files (0.91).
Theresiduals usually have fairly small magnitudes, rarelymore than a few percent of the length of the file.
InFigure 3, for example, residuals have magnitudes lessthan 2% of the length of the target file.If the residuals are large, or if they show a sharpdiscontinuity, then it is very likely that the two textsdon't match up in some way (e.g., a page/figure ismissing or misplaced).
We have used the residuals inthis way to help translators catch potentially embarras-sing errors of this kind.Figure 4 illustrates this use of the residuals for theEuropean Parliamentary text presented in Figure 1.Note that the residuals have relatively largemagnitudes, e.g., 10% of the length of the file,'compared with the 2% magnitudes in Figure 3.Moreover, the residuals in Figure 4 have two verysharp discontinuities.
The location of these sharpdiscontinuities is an important diagnostic clue foridentifying the location of the problem.
In this case,the discontinuities were caused by the two trouble-some footnotes discussed in section 2._m,+!II0 50000 150000 250000x = Position in Engl ish FileFigure 2: char_align output on the "Hard" DatasetItxoA x0 50000 150000 250000x = Position in Engl ish FileFigure 3: rotated version of Figure 2II~ m0 500 1000 1500X = Position in Engl ishFigure 4: Residuals for text in Figure 1(large discontinuities correspond to footnotes)oIIxr~0 50000 150000 250000x = Position in Engl ish FileFigure 5: Figure 3 with judges' alignments30"Hard" Dataset-200 -100 0 100Error (in characters)Figure 6: histogram of errors200"Easy" Dataset-200 -100 0 100Error (in characters)200Figure 7: histogram of errorsFigure 5 shows the correct alignments, as determinedby Simard et ars panel of 8 judges (sampled atsentence boundaries), superimposed over char_align'soutput.
Char_align's results are so close to thejudge's alignments that it is hard to see the differencesbetween the two.
Char_align's errors may be easier tosee in Figure 6, which shows a histogram ofcharalign's errors.
(Errors with an absolute valuegreater than 200 have been omitted; less than 1% ofthe data fall into this category.)
The errors (2_+46bytes) are much smaller than the length of a sentence(129_+84 bytes).
Half of the errors are less than 18characters.In general, performance is slightly better on shorterfiles than on longer files because char_align doesn'tuse paragraph boundaries to break up long files intoshort chunks.
Figure 7 shows the errors for the"easy" dataset (-1___57 bytes), which ironically,happens to be somewhat harder for char_alignbecause the "easy" set is 2.75 times longer than the"hard" dataset.
(As in Figure 6, errors with anabsolute value greater than 200 have been omitted;less than 1% of the data fall into this category.)44.
CognatesHow does char_align work?
The program assumesthat there will often be quite a number of words near xthat will be the same as, or nearly the same as someword nearf(x).
This is especially true for historicallyrelated language pairs such as English and French,which share quite a number of cognates, e.g.,government and gouvernement, though it also holdsfairly well for almost any language pair that makes useof the Roman alphabet since there will usually be afair number of proper nouns (e.g., surnames, companynames, place names) and numbers (e.g., dates, times)that will be nearly the same in the two texts.
We havefound that it can even work on some texts in Englishand Japanese such as the AWK manual, because manyof the technical terms (e.g., awk, BEGIN, END,getline, print, pring3 are the same in both texts.
Wehave also found that it can work on electronic texts inthe same markup language, but different alphabets(e.g., English and Russian versions of 5ESS?telephone switch manuals, formatted in troff).Figures 8 and 9 below demonstrate the cognateproperty using a scatter plot technique which we calldotplots (Church and Helfman, to appear).
The sourcetext (N x bytes) is concatenated to the target ext (Nybytes) to form a single input sequence of Nx+Nybytes.
A dot is placed in position i,j whenever theinput token at position i is the same as the input tokenat position j.
(The origin is placed in the upper leftcorner for reasons that need not concern us here.
)Various signal processing techniques are used tocompress dotplots for large N x +Ny.
Theimplementation of dotplots are discussed in moredetail in section 7.The dotplots in Figures 8 and 9 look very similar, withdiagonal ines superimposed over squares, though thefeatures are somewhat sharper in Figure 8 because theinput is much larger.
Figure 8 shows a dotplot of 3years of Canadian Hansards (37 million words) inEnglish and French, tokenized by words.
Figure 9shows a dotplot of a short article (25 kbytes) thatappeared in a Christian Science magazine in bothEnglish and German, tokenized into 4-grams ofcharacters.The diagonals and squares are commonly found indotplots of parallel text.
The squares have a verysimple explanation.
The upper-left quadrant and thelower-right quadrant are darker than the other twoquadrants because the source text and the target extare more themselves than either is like the other.
Thisfact, of course, is not very surprising, and is notparticularly useful for our purposes here.
However,the diagonal line running through the upper-rightquadrant is very important.
This line indicates howthe two texts should be aligned.Figure 10 shows the upper-fight quadrant of Figure 9,enhanced by standard signal processing techniques(e.g., low-pass filtering and thresholding).
Thediagonal line in Figure 10 is almost straight, but notquite.
The minor deviations in this line are crucial fordetermining the alignment of the two texts.
Figures 11and 12 make it easier to see these deviations by firstrotating the image and increasing the verticalresolution by an order of magnitude.
The alignmentprogram makes use of both of these transformation inorder to track the alignment path with as muchprecision as possible."~!

Bounds EstimationIt is difficult to know in advance how much dynamicrange to set aside for the vertical axis.
Setting therange too high wastes memory, and setting it too lowcauses the signal to be clipped.
We use an iterativesolution to find the optimal range.
On the firstiteration, we set the bounds on the search space, B rainand B rnax, very wide and see where the signal goes.The search will consider matching any byte x in thesource file with some byte in the target file betweenf (x )  - Bn,an and f (x )  + Bmax, where f (x )  is the6?

.Figure 13: Four iterations6.
Resolution Factor EstimationWe need to allocate an array to hold the dots.
Ideally,we would like to have enough memory so that no twopoints in the search space corresponded to the samecell in the array.
That is, we would like to allocate thedotplot array with a width of w =N x +Ny and a heightof h=Bmax+Bmin.
(The array is stored in rotatedcoordinates.)
Unfortunately, this is generally notpossible.
Therefore, we compute a "resolution"factor, r, which indicates how much we have tocompromise from this ideal?
The resolution factor, r,which depends on the available.amount of memory M,indicates the resolution of the dotplot array in units ofbytes per cell. \ ]  (N x + Ny) (Bma x + Brain) r= MThe dotplot array is then allocated to have a width ofN x + Ny Bma x + Bmi nw = and a height of h -r rThe dots are then computed, followed by the path,which is used to compute tighter bounds, if possible.As can be seen in Figure 13, this iteration has atendency to start with a fairly square dotplot andgenerate ever wider and wider dotpiots, until the signalextends to both the top and bottom of the dotplot.In practice, the resolution places a lower bound on theerror rate.
For example, the alignments of the "easy"and "hard" datasets mentioned above had resolutionsof 45 and 84 bytes per cell on the final iterations.
Itshould not be surprising that the error rates are roughlycomparable, ?46 and __.57 bytes, respectively.
Increas-ing the resolution would probably reduce the errorrate.
This could be accomplished by adding memory(M) or by splitting the input into smaller chunks (e.g.,parsing into paragraphs).7.
Dotplot CalculationIn principle, the dotplot could be computed by simplyiterating through all pairs of positions in the two inputfiles, x and y, and testing whether the 4-gram ofcharacters in text x starting at position i are the sameas the 4-gram of characters in text y starting atposition j.f loat dotplot \ [Nx\]  \[Ny\] ;for( i=0; i<Nx; i++)for( j=0; j<Ny; j++)i f (chars4(x,  i) == chars4(y,dotplot \ [ i \ ]  \[j\] = i;e lse dotplot \ [ i \ ]  \[j\] = 0;j))In fact, the dotplot calculation is actually somewhatmore complicated.
First, as suggested above, thedotplot is actually stored in rotated coordinates, with alimited resolution, r, and band limited between Bminand Bma x.
These heuristics are necessary for spaceconsiderations.In addition, another set of heuristics are used to savetime.
The dots are weighted to adjust for the fact thatsome matches are much more interesting than others.Matches are weighted inversely by the frequency ofthe token.
Thus, low frequency tokens (e.g., contentwords) contribute more to the dotplot than highfrequency tokens (e.g., function words).
Thisweighting improves the quality of the results, but moreimportantly, it makes it possible to save time byignoring the less important dots (e.g., those7corresponding to tokens with a frequency greater than100).
This heuristic is extremely important, especiallyfor large input files.
See Church and Helfman (toappear) for more details and fragments of c code.8.
Alignment Path CalculationThe final step is to find the best path of dots.
A sub-optimal heuristic search (with forward pruning) is usedto find the path with the largest average weight.
Thatis, each candidate path is scored by the sum of theweights along the path, divided by the length of thepath, and the candidate path with the best score isreturned.
Admittedly, this criterion may seem a bit adhoc, but it seems to work well in practice.
It has thedesirable property that it favors paths with morematches over paths with fewer matches.
It also favorsshorter paths over longer paths.
It might be possible tojustify the optimization criterion using a model wherethe weights are interpreted as variances.9.
ConclusionThe performance of charalign is encouraging.
Theerror rates are often very small, usually well within thelength of a sentence or the length of a concordanceline.
The program is currently being used bytranslators to produce bilingual concordances forterminology research.
For this application, it isnecessary that the alignment program accept noisy(realistic) input, e.g., raw OCR output, with little or nomanual cleanup.
It is also highly desirable that theprogram produce constructive diagnostics whenconfronted with texts that don't align very wellbecause of various snafus such as missing and/ormisplaced pages.
Charalign has succeeded inmeeting many of these goals because it works at thecharacter level and does not depend on findingsentence and/or paragraph boundaries which aresurprisingly elusive in realistic applications.ReferencesBrown, P., J. Cocke, S. Della Pietra, V. Della Pietra,F.
