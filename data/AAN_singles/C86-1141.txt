Synthesis of Spoken Messages from Semantic Representations(Semantlc-Representat Ion--to-Speech System)Laurence DANL05, Eric LAPORTELaboratoire d'Automatlque Documentalre t LtngulstlqueUniverslte Paris 72, place Jussleu75251 PARIS CEDEX 05Franqoise EMERARDCentre National d'Etudes des Telecommunications22301 LANNION CEDEXAbstractA semantic-representation-to-speech systemcommunicates orally the information given in a seman-tic representation.
Such a system must Integrate a textgeneration module, a phonetic conversion module, a pro-sodic module and a speech synthesizer We will see howthe syntactic information elaborated by the text genera-tlon module is used for both phonetic conversion andprosody, so as to produce the data that must be suppliedto the speech synthesizer, namely a phonetic chainIncluding prosodic Information.IntroductionA spoken message can be produced either to uttera written text (text-to-speech system), or to communi-cate orally the information given in a semantic repre-sentation (semantic-representation-to-speech system).In both cases, the speech synthesizer must be providedwith a phonetic chain including prosodic Information Inorder to reconstruct the acoustic signal.
As we willrecall in 1., syntactic knowledge is necessary to com-pure the phonetic transcription of a written text and toinclude prosodlc Information in It.
Hence a text-to-speech system must Include a parsing module to get thissyntactic knowledge.
On the other hand, a semantic-representation-to-speech system can take advantage ofthe syntactic information elaborated when expressingthe semantic representation in natural language.
There-fore, we design a semantic-representation-to-speechsystem that generates directly from the semanticrepresentation a phonetic string with prosodic markers,without a written stage.
Our system has been designedfor French but It could be extended to other languages.1.
tn French, semantic features ore needed to distinguish only o fewnon-homophonic homographs, mostly technical words,I.
Knowledge needed In a text-to-speech system!.1.
Spelling-to-sound conversionThe first problem encountered in synthesizingspeech from written text is that of spelling-to-soundconversion.
Certain languages are much easier thanothers in this respect.
For example, about 50 rules aresufficient for tl~e conversion of written Spanish intophonetic symbols, with a virtually zero error rate(,Santos & Nombela 1982).
For other languages, such asFrench or English, the problem is much greater Aphoneme does not generally correspond to only onegrapheme, and the reverse ls also true For instance, theword o/seau is pronounced /wazo/ : none of its gra-phemes Is pronounced as would be expected (ie.
/o/ foro, / i / fo r  /~ /s/ for 5, schwa for e, /a / for  a and/y/for u).Spelling-to-sound conversion is further compli-cated by the existence of' non-homophonic homographs,ie.
words spelled the same but pronounced differently.The distinction between two homographs requires toknow their grammatical categories (record Is pro-nounced \['reko:d\] If it is a noun and \[rl'ko:d\] if It is averb), their Inflexional features (read Is pronounced\[ri:d\] in the infinitive form and \[red\] in the preterite), ortheir semantic features (lead Is pronounced tied\] whenIt is a noun or a verb related to the metal and \[li:d\]otherwise) i,In French, words in context raise the additionalproblem of liaison.
A liaison occurs between a wordending in a mute consonant and a word beginning with avowel.
For example, the n in mon is pronounced in monarrivEe but mute in /non depart, However, a liaison Ismade only if this phonological condition is accom-panied with syntactic conditions.
For example, a liaisonis made between a determiner and a noun as in rno/~arrivEe (my arrival), but not between a subject and averb as in Le limonarrive (The silt is coming).599To sum up, the phonetic conversion of Frenchtexts relies on syntactic knowledge to deal with homo-graphs and liaisons.1.2.
ProsodyA text-to-speech system supposes the storage ofminimum acoustic units that allow the reconstructionof the acoustic signal for any sentence.
One solutionconsists In the choice of diphones as acoustic units.
Adiphone is defined as a segment (about 1,200 for French)that goes from the steady state of a phonetic segmentto the steady state of the following segment and thatcontains In its heart all the transitional part betweentwo consecutive sounds.Furthermore, the issue of increasing the natural-ness of synthetic speech requires to take into accountprosodic factors, namely, stress, timing (structuring ofthe utterance by pauses) and intonation.
Intonation ischaracterized by the interaction of three parameters:evolution of intensity and laryngeal frequency as func-tions of duration.The prosodic behavior of one speaker was there-fore subjected to a systematic study.
An acceptablemodel was extracted from this behaviour.
The prosodicprocessing (Emerard 1977) is based on the allocation ofprosodic markers (e.g.
\[=\], \[#\]) at different points in asentence.
Fifteen prosodic markers were considered tobe sufficient for determining suitable prosodic contoursfor the synthesis of French.
Each marker assigns amelody and a rhythm to each syllable of the precedingword.
More precisely, each marker may- cause an interruption in the dlphone concatenation,-introduce a pause,- affect to varying degrees the amplitude of laryngealfrequency (F o) on the last vowel of the word,- determine rising or falling F o movements.The choice of a marker after a constituent is determinedboth by the syntactic category of the constituent (verbalsyntagm, subordinate clause) and by its location insidethe sentence, especially by the existence of a more orless complex right context.
In the simple enunciativesentence Jean part (John is leaving), the prosodicprocessing has to give the following results: Jean \[#\]part \[.\].
Nevertheless, it is not possible to concludewith the following prosodic rules:\[#} is the marker assigned to \[end of subject nounphrase\]\[.\]is the marker assigned to \[end of verbal syntagm\]because in the enunciative sentence Jean part etMar/~;600vl~nt (John is going away and Mary is coming), theprosodic processing has to propose: Jean \[:\] part \[,\] etMarie \[#\] v1~nt \[.\].
A comparison of these two sentencesclearly shows that it is not possible to assign a specificmarker after a constituent only on the basis of itssyntactic category.
It is necessary to take its rightcontext into account, Moreover, placing prosodic mark-ers must be carried out in a hierarchical manner.
Forexample, the marker between the preverbal phrase andthe verbal syntagm depends on the marker assigned atthe end of the clause containing them; this last markerdepends in turn on the marker assigned at the end of thesentence containing the clause.To sum up, the issue of prosody is handled byplacing appropriate markers in appropriate locations.This can only be done when precise syntactic informa-tion is available.2.
Production of a phonetic chain with prosodicmarkersThe system which translates a semantic repre-sentation into a phonetic chain with prosodic markershas been built from a written text generation system(Danlos 1986) that has been modified and completed.
Letus start with a brief description of this generator.2.1.
The generatorThe generator Is modularized into a strategiccomponent and a syntactic component.
From a semanticrepresentation such as(1) EVENT:ACT =: GIVE-PRESENTACTOR = HUM1 =: HUMANNAME ~ JeanOBJECT = TOKI =: FLOWERTYPE = anemoneDATIVE = HUM2 =: HUMANNAME = MarieGOAL = : HAPPYOBJECT = HUM2the strategic component makes conceptual decisions(e.g.
the decision about the order of the informations)and linguistic decisions (e.g.
the decision about thenumber of sentences)(Danlos 1984 a and b).
The outputof this component is a "text template" (TT) that indi-cares1) the splitting up of the text into sentences:TT o (Sentencel.
Sentence 2.
)2) for each sentence, its structure in terms of malnclause and subordinate clauses:Sentence l = (Clause l (SUB (CONJ pour que)Sentence3))Sentence3 ~ Clause23) for each clause, its main verb with Itscomplementation:Clause 1 = ((SUBJECT HUM1 ) (VERB offrir)(OBJECT TOKI) (A-OBJECT HUM2))Clause2 = ((SUBJECT HUM1 ) (VERB rendre)(OBJECT HUM2)(ATTRIBUTE heureux))A text template is turned Into a text by the syntacticcomponent.
This component applies grammar rules (e.g.reduction of a subordinate clause to an Infinitive form),synthesizes the tokens and performs the morphologicalroutines.
For these operations to be carried out, a texttemplate includes, for each sentence, syntactic Infor-mation that Is represented in a tree whose nodes aresyntacti~ categories such as S (sentence), CL (clause),SUBJECT or VERB.
A text template may be made up ofseveral sentences, however we wlll give an examplewith a single sentence because the operations ofphonetic conversion and entering prosodic markers areperformed within a sentence, independently of the othersentences.
From the semantic representation (I), thetext template may be:(2) ((S (CL (SUBJECT HUM1) (VERB offrtr)(OBJECT TOK I ) (A-OBJECT HUM2))(SUB (COW pour que)(S (CL (SUBJECT HUM1 ) (VERB rendre)(OBJECT HUM2)(ATTRIBUTE heureux))))).
)The syntactic component turns it Into a tree whoseleaves are words:((S (CL (SUBJECT (NP (N Jean)))(VERB a offert)(OBJECT (NP (DET des) (N anemones)))(A-OBJECT (NP (PREP ~) (N Marie))))(SUB (S (CL (CONJ pour) (PPV la)(VERB rendre)(ATTRIBUTE heureuse))))).
)The erasing of the auxiliary vocabulary leads to:Jean a offert des anemones ~ Mar/e pour la rendr~iveureuse.
(John offered anemones to Mary to make her happy.
)The syntactic component contains a morphologicalmodule (Courtois 1984) that works out an inflectedform (e.g.
heureuse, the feminine singular of heureuxJgiven a baslc form (e.g.
heureux) and Inflexlonal fea-tures (e.g.
feminine, singular).
Thls module Is based on adictionary that indicates an inflexlon mode for eachbasic form.
Each inflexlon mode is associated with arule that computes inflected forms.The only modification made to the text generationsystem was to replace the morphologlcal module wlth amorpho-phonetic module that proceeds to both inflexlonand speIllng-to-sound conversion.
With thls modifica-tion, the syntactic component produces a tree whoseleaves are phonetic words.2.2.
Inflexlon and phonetic conversionA French morpho-phonetlc system has been builtto compute an Inflected phonetic form given an ortho-graphic basic word and Inflexlonal features (Laporte1986).
This system uses an intermediate phonologicalrepresentation devised to optimize not only wordInflexion and phonetic conversion but also liaison pro-cessing.
The system works In the following way: given abasic orthographic form (e.g.
heureux), its syntacticcategory and Inflexlonal features (e.g.
adjective, femi-nine, singular), a phonological dictionary works out itsphonological representation (e.g.
~r~z).
The word is theninflected (e.g.
~r~z) by means of a set of rules.
Theserules for phonologlcal Inflexlon are much simpler thanthose that would be required for Inflecting orthographicor phonetic words.
By way of Illustration, the feminineof the following adjectlves: z)on, grand, gros, Igger,pet/t, pr/s, sot, vu can be obtained from their phono-logical representatlon wlth only I rule, whereas 3would be required when starting from their orthographicrepresentation and 8 from their phonetic representation(Laporte 1984).
The shift from phonological words tophonetic words entails knowing where liaisons shouldtake place.
Recall that a llalson takes place when bothsyntactic and phonological conditions are satisfied.
Inthe semantlc-representatlon-to-speech system, thesyntactlc tree of the sentence allows us to place liaisonmarkers at the points where a liaison is syntacticallyallowed.
The conversion of phonological words Intophonetic words Is then performed by a set of straight-forward rules that check the phonologlcal conditions ofliaisons at the points wher'e a lialson marker Is present.Laporte's system Is represented In Fig.
I.From the text template (2), the syntacticcomponent with the morpho-phonetic module outputs thefollowing tree:601Basic wordsInflectedwordsOrthographicalrepresentationPhonologicalrepresentationPhoneticrepresentation50,000- > 50,000dictionary lrules350,000 150,000rules50,000150,000Fig.

However,there is not an isomorphic relation between the syntaxand the prosody of a sentence.
For example, the syn-tactic structures of Jean est part/a Paris (John wentto Paris) and / /estpart ia Parts (He went to Paris) arenearly identical, whereas there is a prosodic markerafter the noun Jean and none after the pronoun i lConversely, the syntactic representations of Jean aparle de ce prob/eme ~ Marie (John spoke about thisproblem to Mary) et Jean a parle de ce probl~me ~ Paris(John spoke about this problem in Paris) are differentalthough their prosodic markers are identical.
As a con-sequence, we had to build a complete syntactlco-prosodic grammar for French ~.
This grammar enables usto obtain a structure of a sentence that is Isomorphic toits prosodic structure and computable from its syn-tactic structure.
A syntactico-prosodic category cor-responds- either to a syntactic category (e.g.
the syntactlco-prosodic category S is equivalent to the syntacticcategory S),- or to a sequence of syntactic categories (e.g.
theprosodic category POV \[post-verbal phrase\] groupstogether all the complements which appear after the2.

This solution was also considered by Martin (1979).verbal syntagm \[VS\], and the prosodic category PRV\[pre-verbal phrase\] groups all the complements whichappear before the VS),- or to several syntactic categories (e.g.
the prosodiccategory VC \[verbal complement\] corresponds to thefollowing syntactic categories: SUBJECT, OBJECT,A-OBJECT and ATTRIBUTE).The first operation performed In the prosodiccomponent hus consists in transforming the syntactictree produced by the syntactic component into a syntac-tico-prosodic tree.
From (3), this operation producesthe following tree, in which the leaves are written inspelling representation for readability:(4) ((S (CL (PRV (VC (NP (N Jean))))(VS a offert)(POV (CV (NP (DET des) (N anemones)))(CV (NP (PREP ~) (N Marie)))))(SUB (S (CL (CONJ pour) (VS la rendre)(VC heureuse))))).
)Besides the syntactico-prosodic grammar, a func-tion SEG-C has been designed for each syntactlco-prosodic category C. Such a function takes two argu-ments: a constituent IX\] of the category C and theprosodic marker x that Is to appear to the right of \[X\].
Itcomputes the prosodic markers that have to be enteredIn \[X\].
More precisely, If the syntactlco-prosodic ana-lysis of IX\] Is:\[x\] = (Ix 1\] \[x d ... \[xn\])then:(SEG-C \[X\] x) = (\[X 1\] x 1 \[X 2\] x 2 .. \[Xn_ 1\] xn_ I \[X n\] x)where x 1, x2, ... Xn_ 1 are the appropriate markers.
As anIllustration, the grammar lays down that\[CL\] = (CL \[CONJ\]I \[PRV\]I \[V5\] \[POV\]I)where the sign "r' following an element means that theelement ls either absent or present once.
The function602(SEG-CL \[CL\] x) indicates that- when \[PRV\] is present, a marker f(x) must be enteredafter it;- when \[POV\] is present, a marker g(x) must be enteredafter \[VS\];- in any case, x is after the last constituent, i.e.
\[POV\]when present, \[VS\] otherwise.The algorithm for entering the markers works ina recursive manner by means of a function SEG.
Given aconstituent \[X\] and the marker x that is to appear to theright of IX\], this function figures out the category C of\[X\] and calls (SEG-C \[X\] x).
Next, the functions(SEG-C1 \[X~\] xl), (SEG-C 2 \[X 2\] x 2) .... (SEG-C n \[X n\] x)are called.
For example, after (SEG-CL \[CL\] x) has beencalled, the entering of the markers into \[PRV\] whenpresent is executed by(SEG \[PRV\] f(x)) = (SEG-PRV (PRV\] f(x)).When \[POV\] is present, the functions (SEG \[VS\] g(x)) and(SEG \[POV\] x) are called, otherwise the function (SEG\[VS\] x) is called.
The function 5EG is first applied to theroot of the arborescent syntactico-prosodic structure ofthe sentence involved and to its final punctuation mark("."
"," "?"
";" ":") which corresponds to a prosodic marker.When the recurslon Is over, the auxiliary vocabulary iserased, leaving a phonetic chain wlth prosodic markers.As an example, the function SEG applied to (4) leads tothe following result:(.5) 2~ \[=\] a of?R \[$\] de zanem;)n \[=\] a maR1 \[,\] puR laff~dR \[$\] OROZ \[,\](Jean \[=\] a offert \[$\] des anemones \[=\] ~Marie \[,\] pour larendre \[$\] heureuse \[,\])3.
Algorithm end resultsThe phonetic chain with prosodic markers produ-ced by the system are forwarded to the speech synthe-sizer developed at CNET (Courbon & Emerard 1982).

)ConclusionThe semantic-representation-to-speech systemdeveloped in COMMON-LISP produces a spoken messageof about 35 words in less than 1 second.In our system, only the strategic component isdomain dependent.
The lexicon and discourse structuresused to build the text templates are domain dependentlinguistic data.
The rest of the system is domainindependent.
Let us recapitulate the data and rulesintegrated in It:- a syntactic component which can apply the Frenchgrammar rules whatever the structure of the texts andthe syntax of the sentences;- a complete phonological dlctionaryof the 50,000 basicforms of French and a set of rules for obtaining aphonetic text from a phonological text;604- a complete syntactico-prosodic grammar of French anda set of rules that enable us to enter prosodic markersin a sentence whatever the syntax of the sentence;- a speech synthesizer and a synthesis software.Of course, these data and rules are only valid for Frenchbut it must be clear that the same kind of data isrequired for other languages and that the algorithmshould be similar.Dlbliogroph UCOURBON, J.
