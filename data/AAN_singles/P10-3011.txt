USA.c-mcfate@northwestern.eduAbstractA robust dictionary of semantic frames is anessential element of natural languageunderstanding systems that use ontologies.However, creating lexical resources thataccurately capture semantic representations enmasse is a persistent problem.
Where the sheeramount of content makes hand creationinefficient, computerized approaches oftensuffer from over generality and difficulty withsense disambiguation.
This paper describes asemi-automatic method to create verbsemantic frames in the Cyc ontology byconverting the information contained inVerbNet into a Cyc usable format.
Thismethod captures the differences in meaningbetween types of verbs, and uses existingconnections between WordNet, VerbNet, andCyc to specify distinctions between individualverbs when available.
This method provides27,909 frames to OpenCyc which currentlyhas none and can be used to extendResearchCyc as well.
We show that theseframes lead to a 20% increase in samplesentences parsed over the Research Cyc verblexicon.1 IntroductionThe Cyc1 knowledge base represents generalpurpose knowledge across a vast array ofdomains.
Low level event and individual factsare contained in larger definitional hierarchicalrepresentations and contextualized throughmicrotheories (Matuszek et al 2006).
Higherorder predicates built into Cyc?s formallanguage, CycL, allow efficient inferencingabout context and meta-language reasoningabove and beyond first-order logic rules(Ramachandran et al 2005).Because of the expressiveness and size of theontology, Cyc has been used in NL applications1http://www.opencyc.org/cycincluding word sense disambiguation and ruleacquisition by reading (Curtis, Cabral, & Baxter,2006; Curtis et al 2009).
Such applications useNL-to-Cycl parsers which use Cyc semanticframes to convert natural language into Cycrepresentations.
These frames represent sentencecontent through a set of propositional logicassertions that first reify the sentence in terms ofa real world event and then define the semanticrelationships between the elements of thesentence, as described later.
Because theseparsers require semantic frames to representsentence content, existing parsers are limited dueto Cyc?s limited coverage (Curtis et al 2009).The goal is to increase this coverage byautomatically translating the class frames inVerbNet into individual verb templates.2 Previous WorkThe Cyc knowledge base is continuouslyexpanding and much work has been done onautomatic fact acquisition as well as mergingontologies.
However, the semantic frames remainmostly hand-made in ResearchCyc2 and non-existent in the open-license OpenCyc3.Translating VerbNet frames into Cyc will expandthe natural language capabilities of both.There has been previous research on mappingexisting Cyc templates to VerbNet, but thus farthese approaches have not created new templatesto address Cyc?s lapses in coverage.
One suchattempt, King and Crouch?s (2005) unifiedlexicon, compiled many lexical resources into aunified representation.
While this researchcreated a valuable resource, it did not extend theexisting Cyc coverage.
Of the 45, 704 entries inthe UL only 3,544 have Cyc entries (King &Crouch, 2005).Correspondences between a few VerbNetframes and ResearchCyc templates have alsobeen mapped out through the VxC VerbNet Cyc2http://research.cyc.com3  http://opencyc.org61Mapper (Trumbo 2006).
These mappings becamea standard that we later used to evaluate thequality of our created frames.A notable exception to the hand-madeparadigm is Curtis et als (2009) TextLearnerwhich uses rules and existing semantic frames tohandle novel sentence structures.
Given anexisting template that fits some of the syntacticconstraints of the sentence, TextLearner willattempt to create a new frame by suggesting apredicate that fits the missing part.
Often theseare general underspecified predicates, butTextLearner is able to use common sensereasoning and existing facts to find bettermatches (Curtis et al 2009).While TextLearner improves its performancewith time, it is not an attempt to create newframes on a large scale.
Creating generalizedframes based on verb classes will increase thedepth of the Cyc Lexicon quickly.
Furthermore,automatic processes like those in TextLearnercould be used to make individual verb semanticframes more specific.3 VerbNetVerbNet is an extension of Levin?s (1993) verbclasses that uses the class structure to applygeneral syntactic frames to member verbs thathave those syntactic uses and similar semanticmeanings (Kipper et al 2000).
The currentversion has been expanded to include classdistinctions not included in Levin?s originalproposal (Kipper et al  2006).VerbNet is an appealing lexical resource forthis task because it represents semantic meaningas the union of both syntactic structure andsemantic predicates.
VerbNet uses LexicalizedTree Adjoining Grammar to generate thesyntactic frames.
The syntactic roles in the frameare appended with general thematic roles that fillarguments of semantic predicates.
Each event isbroken down into a tripartite structure asdescribed by Moens & Steedman (1988) and usesa time modifier for each predicate to indicatewhen specific predicates occur in the event.
Thisallows for a dynamic representation of changeover an event.
(Kipper et al 2000).This approach is transferable to Cyc?ssemantic templates in which syntactic slots fillpredicate arguments in the context of a specificsyntactic frame.
Both also have extensiveconnections to WordNet2.0, an electronic editionof Miller?s (1985) WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).4 MethodThe general method for creating semantictemplates in Cyc requires creating Verb ClassFrames and then using Cyc predicates andheuristic rules to create individual frames foreach member verb.4.1 OpenCycThe existing semantic templates are accessiblethrough the ResearchCyc KB.
However, for thepurposes of this study the OpenCyc KB wasused.
The OpenCyc KB is an open sourceversion of ResearchCyc that contains much ofthe definitional information and higher orderpredicates, but has had much of the lower levelspecific facts and the entire word lexiconremoved (Matuszek et al 2006).
However, theassertions generated by this method are fullyusable in ResearchCyc.
OpenCyc was used so asto minimize the effect of existing semanticframes on new frame creation.
Since OpenCycand VerbNet are open-licensed, our translationprovides an open-license extension to OpenCycto support its use in natural language research.4.2 Knowledge RepresentationThe primary difficulty with integrating VerbNetframes into Cyc was overcoming differences inknowledge representation.
Cyc semantictemplates reify events as an instance of acollection of events.
The arguments correspondto syntactic roles.
The following is a semantictemplate for a ditransitive use of the word givefrom ResearchCyc.
(verbSemTrans Give-TheWord 0(PPCompFrameFnDitransitivePPFrameType To-TheWord)(and(isa ACTION GivingSomething)(objectGiven ACTION OBJECT)(giver ACTION SUBJECT)(givee ACTION OBLIQUE-OBJECT)))However, VerbNet uses semantic predicates thatdescribe relationships between two thematicroles.
The following is a frame for the VerbNetclass Give as presented in the Unified VerbIndex4.NP V NP PP.recipientexample4 http://verbs.colorado.edu/verb-index/62"They lent a bicycle to me.
"syntaxAgent V Theme {to} Recipientsemantics-has_possession(start(E), Agent,Theme)-has_possession(end(E), Recipient,Theme)-transfer(during(E), Theme)-cause(Agent, E)The predicate has_possession occurstwice, at the beginning and end of the event.
Inone case the Agent has possession and in thesecond the Recipient does.
Both refer to theTheme which is being transferred.In Cyc the hasPossession relationship toAgent and Recipient is represented with thepredicates giver and givee.
The subject andoblique-object of the sentence fill thosearguments, and the actual change of possession isrepresented by the collection of eventsGivingSomething.
The VerbNet Theme is theobject in objectGiven.
Thus an individualVerbNet semantic predicate often has a many-to-one mapping with Cyc predicates.4.3 PredicatesTo account for representation differences, asingle Cyc predicate was mapped to a uniquecombination of Verbnet predicate and thematicrole (ie.
Has_Possession Agent atstart(E) => givee).
56 of these mappingswere done by hand.
Though far from exhaustive,these hand mappings represent many frequentlyused predicates in VerbNet.
The hand mappingwas done by looking at the uses of the predicateacross different classes.Because the mappings were not exhaustive, asafety net automatically catches predicates thathaven?t been mapped.
The VerbNet predicatesCause and InReactionTo corresponded to theCyc predicates performedBy, doneBy, andcauses-Underspecified.
These predicateswere selected whenever the VerbNet predicatesoccurred with a theme role that was the subjectof the sentence.
The more specificperformedBy was selected in cases where theframe?s temporal structure suggested a result.The predicate doneBy was selected in othercases.
The causes-Underspecified predicatewas used in frames whose time modifierssuggested that they were continuous states.
Thepredicates patientGeneric andpatientGeneric-Direct were used when apredicate was not found for a required object oroblique object.Some Cyc templates don?t have predicates thatreference the event.
For example, the verb touchcan be efficiently represented with the relation(objectsInContact :SUBJECT :OBJECT).Situations like this were hand assigned.4.4 CollectionsIn Cyc, concepts are represented by collections.Inheritance between collections is specified bythe genls relationship, which can be viewed assubset.
Most verb frames have an associatedcollection of events of which each use is aninstance.
The associated collection of the classframe templates was automatically selected usingthe common link that both resources share withWordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).
To do this, theWordNet synsets of the member verbs for a classwere matched with their Cyc-WordNetsynonymousExternalConcept assertion.
TheCyc representation became a denoted collection.The most general collection out of the list ofviable collections was chosen as the general classframe collection.
The number of genls links toa collection was used as a proxy for generality.In the case of a tie the first was chosen.While the most general collection was used forthe class semantic frame, at the level ofindividual verb frames the specific synsetdenoted collection was substituted for the moregeneral one when applicable.
Verbs withmultiple meanings across classes were given aunique index number for each sense.
However,within a given class each word only received onedenotation.
The general class level collection wasused in cases where no Cyc-WordNet-VerbNetlink existed.
If no verb had a synset in Cyc, thegeneral collection Situation was used.4.5 Subcategorization FramesEach syntactic frame is a subcategorizationframe or a subset of one.
In this case, the namingconventions were different between VerbNet andCyc.
Frames with prepositions kept Cyc?snotation for prepositional phrases.
However,since VerbNet had a much broader coverage theVerbNet subcat names were kept.4.6 AssertionsThe process above was used to create generalclass frames, for example,(verbClassSemTrans give-13.1(TransitiveNPFrame)63(and(isa :ACTIONMakingSomethingAvailable)(patient-GenericDirect :ACTION:OBJECT)(performedBy :ACTION :SUBJECT)(fromPossessor :ACTION :SUBJECT)(objectOfPossessionTransfer :ACTION:OBJECT)))These frames use more generic collections andapply to a VerbNet class rather than a specificverb.Specific verb semantic templates were createdby inferring that each member verb of a VerbNetclass participated in every template in a class.Again, collections were taken from existingWordNet connections if possible.
The output wasassertions in the Cyc semantic template format:(verbSemTrans Loan-TheWord 0(PPCompFrameFn NP-PP (WordFn to))(and(isa :ACTION Lending)(patient-GenericDirect :ACTION:OBJECT)(performedBy :ACTION :SUBJECT)(fromPossessor :ACTION :SUBJECT)(toPossessor :ACTION :OBLIQUE-OBJECT)(objectOfPossessionTransfer :ACTION:OBJECT)))This method for giving class templates to eachverb in a class was written as a Horn clause forthe FIRE reasoning engine.
FIRE is a reasoningengine that incorporates both logical inferencebased on axioms and analogy-based reasoningover a Cyc-derived knowledge base (Forbus,Mostek, & Ferguson, 2002).
FIRE could then bequeried for implied verb templates which becamethe final list of verb templates.4.7 SubclassesVerbNet has an extensive classification systeminvolving subclasses.
Subclasses contain verbsthat take all of the syntactic formats of the mainclass plus additional frames that verbs in themain class cannot.Verbs in a subclass inherit frames from theirsuperordinate classes.
FIRE was used again tocreate the verb semantic templates.Each subclass template?s collection wasselected using the same process as the mainclass.
If no subclass member had a Cycdenotation, then the main class collection wasused.5 ResultsThe end result of this process was the creation of27,909 verb semantic template assertions for5,050 different verbs.
This substantially increasesthe number of frames for ResearchCyc andcreates frames for OpenCyc.To test the accuracy of the results and theircontribution to the knowledge base we ran twotests.
The first was to compare our frames withthe 139 hand-checked VxC matches by hand.
Ofthe 139 frames from VxC, 81 were qualified as?good?
matches, and 58 as ?maybe?
(Trumbo,2006).
Since these frames already existed in Cycand were hand matched we used them as thecurrent gold standard for what a VerbNet frametranslated into Cyc should look like.Matches between frames were evaluated alongseveral criteria.
First was whether the frame hadas good a syntactic parse as the manual version.This was defined as having predicates thataddressed all syntactic roles in the sentence or, ifnot enough, as many as the VxC match.Secondly we asked if the collection was similarto the manual version.
Frames with collectionsthat were too specific, unrelated, or justSituation were discarded.
Because frame-specific predicates were not created on a largescale, a frame was not rejected for using generalpredicates.It is important to note a difference in matchingmethodology between the VxC matches and ourframes.
First, the VxC mappings included framesin Cyc that only partially matched moresyntactically robust VerbNet frames.
Our frameswere only included if they matched the intendedVerbNet syntactic frame.
Because of this someof our frames beat the VxC gold standard forsyntactic completeness.
The VxC frames alsoincluded multiple similar senses for an individualverb.
Our verbs had one denotation per class orsubclass.
Thus in some cases our frames failednot from over generalizing but because they wereonly meant to represent one meaning per class.Since the strength of our approach lies ingenerating a near exhaustive list of syntacticframes and not multiple word senses, these kindsof failures are not necessarily representative ofthe success of the frames as a whole.A total of 55 frames (39.5%) were correct withseventeen (30.9%) of the correct frames having amore complete syntactic parse than the manuallymapped frame.
48 frames (34.5%) were rejectedonly for having too general or specific acollection; however ten (20.8%) of the collection64rejected frames had a more complete parse thantheir manual counterparts.
Thus 103 frames(74.1%) were as syntactically correct or betterthan the existing Cyc frame mapped to thatVerbNet frame.
Nine (6.47%) frames failedsyntactically, with four (44.4%) of the syntaxfailures also having the wrong collection.Thirteen frames ( 9.3%) were not matched.Fifteen frames (10.8%) from the Hold class,were separated out for a formatting error thatresulted in a duplicate, though not syntacticallyincorrect, predicate.
The predicate repeated was(objectsInContact :ACTION :OBJECT).
12of 15 frames (80%) had accurate collections.The second test compared the results of anatural language understanding system usingeither ResearchCyc alone or a version ofResearchCyc with our frames substituted fortheirs.
The test corpus was 50 randomly selectedexample sentences from the VerbNet frameexamples.
We used the EA NLU parser, whichuses a bottom-up chart parser and compositionalsemantics to convert the semantic content of asentence in CycL (Tomai & Forbus 2009).Possible frames are returned in choice sets.
Aparse was judged correct if it returned a verbframe for the central verb of the examplesentence that either wholly or in combinationwith preposition frames addressed the syntacticconstituents of the sentence with an acceptablecollection and acceptable predicates.
Againgeneral predicates were acceptable.ResearchCyc got sixteen out of 50 framescorrect (32%).
Eleven frames (22%) did notreturn a template but did return a denotation to aCyc collection.
Twelve verbs (24%) retunednothing, while eleven (22%) returned frames thatwere either not the correct syntactic frame orwere a different sense of the verb.EA NLU running the VerbNet generatedframes got 26 out of 50 (52%) frames correct.Twelve frames (24%) returned nothing.
Eightframes, (16%) failed because of a too specific ortoo general collection.
Four generated frames(8%) were either not the correct syntactic frameor were for a different sense of the verb.
Thiswas an overall 20% improvement in accuracy.Five (10%) parses using the VerbNetgenerated correct frames that were labeled asnoisy.
Noisy frames had duplicate predicates ormore general predicates in addition to thespecific ones.
The Hold frames separated out inthe VxC test are an example of noisy frames.None of these frames were syntactically incorrector contradictory.
The redundant predicates arisebecause the predicate safety net had to be greedy.This was in the interest of capturing morecomplex frames that may have multiple relationsfor the same thematic role in a sentence.This evaluation is based on parser recall andframe semantic accuracy only.
As would beexpected, adding more frames to the knowledgebase did result in more parser retrievals andpossible interpretations.
The implications for thison word sense disambiguation is evaluatedfurther in the discussion.
To improve predicatespecificity, the next phase of research with theseframes will be to implement predicatestrengthening methods that move down thehierarchy to find more specific predicates toreplace the generalized ones.
Thus in the futureprecision both in terms of frame retrieval andpredicate specificity will be a vital metric forevaluating success.6 DiscussionAs has been demonstrated in this approach and inprevious research like Curtis et als (2009)TextLearner, Cyc provides powerful reasoningcapabilities that can be used to successfully infermore specific information from general existingfacts.
We hope that future research is able to usethis feature to provide more specific individualframes.
Because Cyc is consistently changingand growing, an approach that uses Cycrelationships will be able to improve as theknowledge base improves its coverage.While many of the frames are general, theyprovide a solid foundation for further research.As they are now, the added 27,909 framesincrease the language capabilities of OpenCycwhich previously had none.
For ResearchCyc thecontribution is less clear-cut.
The 27,909VerbNet frames have approximately 7.93 timesthe coverage of the existing 3,517 ResearchCycframes5 and they improved ResearchCyc parserperformance by 20%.
However, with 35% offrames in the VxC comparison and 16% in theparse test failing because of collections, and10.8% of the VxC comparison set and 10% ofcorrect parses classified as noisy, these framesare not as precise as the existing frames.
Thegoal of these frames is not necessarily to replacethe existing frames, but rather to extend coverageand provide a platform for further developmentwhether by hand or through automatic methods.Precision can be improved upon in future5D.
Lenat briefing, March 15, 200665research and is facilitated by the expressivenessof Cyc.
Predicate strengthening, using existingrelationships to infer more specific predicates, isthe next step in creating robust frames.Additionally, there is a tradeoff between thenumber of frames covered and efficiency ofdisambiguation.
More frame choices make itharder for parsers to choose the correct frame,but it will hopefully improve their handling ofmore complex sentence structures.One possible solution to competition and over-generality is to add verbs incrementally by class.The class based approach makes it easy toseparate verbs by types, such as verbs that relateto mechanical processes or emotion verbs.
Onecould use classes of frames to strengthen specificareas of parsing while choosing not to take verbsfrom a class covering a domain that the parseralready performs strongly in.
This approach canreduce interference with existing domains thathave been hand built and extended beyond thestandard Cyc KB for individual research.Furthermore, semi-automatic approaches likethis generate information more quickly than onecould do by hand.
Thus an approach tocomputational verb semantic representation thatis rooted in classes can take advantage of modernreasoning sources like Cyc to efficiently createsemantic knowledge.AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported by the Air ForceOffice of Scientific Research and NorthwesternUniversity.
