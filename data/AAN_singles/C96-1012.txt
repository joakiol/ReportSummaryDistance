Cortms-based al)proaches are exet:ut(;(1 based on the in-tuitively t'easibh', assmnption that the higher thedegree of similarity betwee, n the context of an ill-put word and tim context ill which tit(; word ap-l)cars in a sens(~' in a tort)us , the more plausible itbecomes that the word is used in the same s(.~nse.Corpus-/)ased m(;thotls are.
classified into two ap-1)rt)aches: examI)le-I)ased approaches (Kurohashiand Nagao, 1994; Urmnoto, 1994) and statistic-based apl)roa(:hes (l~rown et al, 1991; 1)tLglm andItai, 1!
)94; Niwa and Nitta, 11994; Schiitze, 1992;Ym'owsky, 1995).
We follow the examt)h>basedapl)roach ill exl)laining its effe.etivity for verb sensedisamibiguation i Japanese.A representative example-based method forverb sense disambiguation was proposed by Kuro-hashi and Nagao (Kurohashi's inethod) (Kuro-hashi rand Nagao, 1994).
Their method uses an0,xamph; database, containing examples of colloca-tions as in figure 1.
Figure 1 shows a fragmentof tim entry associated wittl the Japan(;se verbto'ru.
As with most words, the ve, rb to'r"?t has multi-pie senses, examples of whit:h are "to take/steal,""to attain," "to subst'ril)e" and "to reserve," Thedatabase gives one or more case frame(s) associ-ated with tilt', verbs for each of their senses.
In.Japanese, a coutI)lelnt;nt Of a verb, which is a con-stituent of the case frame of the verb, consistsof a nonii phrase (case filler) followed by a casemarker such ms ga (nominative) or o (accusative).The database has ~m example set of case fillers foreach case.
As shown in figure 1, examples of acomi)lement c.an be considered as an extensionaldescription of the selectional restriction on it.The task (:onside.red in this paper is %o in-terpret" a verb in an input s('.ntcnt:e, i.e.
tochoose ()lit) sense from a set of candidate sensesof the verb.
Given an input sentence, Kuro-hashi's method interprets the verb in the input bycomputing semantic similarity between the inputand exalnples.
For this computation, Kurohashi'snmthod experimeIltally uses the Ja,panese wordthesaurus Bunruigoihyo (National-Language R(>search Institute, 1964).
As with Inost thesauruses,the length of the 1lath between two words in Bun-r'uigoihyo is exl)e, eted tt) reflect the similarity be,-tween them.
Figure 2 ilhlstrates a fragment ofB'unruigoihyo in(:hlding some of the nouns in fig-ure 1.
I,et us take the example sentence (1).

The seleetional restriction of a certain case isstronger than those of others.
For example,in tile accusative, the selectional restrictionof "to subscribe" is stronger than that of "totake/steal" which Mlows various kinds of ob-jects as its case filler.In this p~tt)er, we improve on Kurohashi's methodby introducing a formalization of these notions,and report the result of a comparative experiment.2 Mot iw,  t ionProperty 1 in section 1 is exemplified by theinput sentence (2).
(2) shach5 ga sh?kanshi o toru.
(presideut-NOM) (magazine-ACe) (?
)The nominative, shachd ("company president"),in (2) is found in the %o attaiIf ' ease frame of tornand there is no other co-occurrence in any othersense of toru; therefore, the nominative supportsan interpretation "to attain."
On the other hand,?nominative accusativeFigure 3: The semantic ranges of the nominative andaccusative with verb tornthe accusative, ,sh, gtkanshi ("magazine"), is mostsimilar to the examples included ill tile accusativeof the "to subscribe" and therefore the accusativesupports another interpretation "to snt)scribe.
"Although tile most plausible interpretation hereis actually the latter, Kurohashi's method wouldchoose tile former since (a) the degree in whichthe nominative sut)ports "to attain" happe.ns to bestronger than the degree in which the accusatiw'~supports "to subscribe," and (b) their method al-ways relies equally on the similarity in the nomi-native and the accusative.
Itowever, in the case oftorn, since the semantic range of nouns collocatingwith the verb in the nominative does not seem tohave a strong delinearization i a semantic sense,it would be difficult, or even risky, to properlyinterpret the verb sense based on tile similarityin the nominative.
In contrast, since the rangesare diverse in the accusative, it would lm fe.asible.to rely more strongly on the similarity in the ac-cusative.
This argument can be illustrated as infigure 3, in which the symbols "1" and "2" de-note example case fillers of different case frainesrespectively, and an input sentence includes twocase fillers denoted by "x" and "y."
The figureshows the distribution of example case fillers tie-noted by those symbols in a semantic space, wherethe semantic similarity between two case fillers isrepresented by the physical distance between twosymbols.
In the nominative, since "x" ha.ptmns to60})e i l iuch  cl()s(;r to  & "2"  th~Ln ~tlly "1~" "X" IIh~ybe estimated to belong to the range of "2"s al-l, hough "x" ae('.ually belongs to both sets of " l"sa.nd "2"s. Ill the accusative, however, "y" wouldhe prol)erly estimated to belong to " l"s due.

This argument suggests thatwe introduce, the degree of (:ontribution of case toverb sense disaml)iguation.

contribution of case to verb sense disambigna-lion (CCD),?
relative strength of selectional restriction(RSSR).First, in regard to CCD, we compute the plausi-bility of an interpretation by the weighted averageof the degree of similarity for each case as in equa-tion (a), replacing equation (1).P(3) = w3 Ec  g3,e)" CCD(c)Ec CUD(c) (3)Here, CCD(c) is a newly introduced weight, suchthat CCD(c) is greater when the degree of casee's contribution is higher.Second, in regard to RSSR, the stronger the se-lectional restriction on a case of a case frame is,the less plausible all input complement satisfiesthat restriction as mentioned in section 1.
Notehere that tile plausibility of an interpretation of aninput verb can be regarded as the plausibility thatthe input complements satisfy the selectional re-striction associated with that interpretation.
Thisleads us to replace SIM(nc, Es,c) in equation (3)with PSS(nc, ?s,c), which denotes the plausibil-ity that the case filler nc satisfies the selectionalrestriction described by the example case fillers~S,C.P(3) = w3 Ec PSS('nc, g3,c) ?
CCD(c)EcCCD(c) (4)From the assumption that PSS(nc,Es,c) shouldbe greater for a larger SIM(ne,?s,c) and lesserrelative strength of the selectional restriction de-scribed by ?s,c, we can derive equation (5).PSS(nc, ?s,c) = SIM(nc, Ss,c) - RSSR(3, c)Here, RSSR(3, c) denotes the relative strength oftile selectional restriction on a case c associatedwith a sense 3.3For more  detail, see Kurohashi's paper  (Kuro-hashi and Nagao, 1994).4 Computat ion  o f  CCD and RSSRThe degree of contribution of case to verb sensedisambiguation (CCD) is computed in the follow-ing way.
The degree of contribution of a caseshould be high if the semantic range of the exam-ple case fillers in that case is diverse in the caseframe (see figure 3).
Let a certain verb have nsenses (sl, 32, .
.
.
,  s~) and the set of example casefillers of a case c associated with 3~ be $3~,c.
Then,the degree of c's contribution to disambiguation,CCD(c), is expected to be higher if the examplecase filler sets {?si,c I i = 1 , .
.
.
,  n} share less ele-ments.
This can be realized by equation (6).CCD( ) =1 I& .d  + I&j, l - n &j, li=1 j= i+t(6)a is the constant for parameterizing to what ex-tent CCD influences verb sense disambiguation.When a is larger, CCD more strongly influencesthe system's output.
Considering the data sparse-ness problem, we do not distinguish two nonnsX and Y in equation (6) if X and Y are similarenough, as in equation (7).
{X} + {Y} = {X} if 3im(X,Y) >= 9 (7)Relative strength of selectional restriction(RSSR) is computed in the following way.
Tileselectional restriction on a ease of a case frame isexpected to be strong if the example case fillersof tile case are similar to each ()tiler.
Given a setof example case fillers ill a case associated witha verb sense, the strength of the selectional re-striction on that case (SSR) can be estimated byaveraging the similarity between any combinationof two elements of that set.
Thus, given a set Es,cof example case fillers in a case c associated witha verb sense s, tile SSR of c associated with s Callbe estimated by equation (8), where ?~,c is an i4helement of ?3,c, and m is the number of elementsin ?s,c, i .
e .
m = \[$3,c\[.E =I Ej=++,SSR(s, c) = ,+C2 if m > 1maximum otherwise(8)In the case m = 1, that is, the case has only oneexample case filler, tile SSR becomes maxinmm,because the selectional constraint associated withthe case is highest (following table 1, we assign 11as the maximum to SSR).
The relative strength ofselectional restriction (RSSR) of a case associatedwith a verb sense is estimated by the ratio of tileSSR of tile case to the summation of the SSRsof each case associated with the verb sense, as in62equation (9) 4ssR(.
, ,0 (9)a Evahmt ionOur experiment compared the performance ofthe following methods:1. tOlrohashi's method: equation (1)2. our method (considering CCD): equation (3)3. our method (considering /)oth CCD andRSSR): equation (4)In method 2 and 3, the influence of CCD, i.e.
(~ inequation (6), was extremely large.
We will showthe relation between the w~riation of c~ and tileperformance of the system later in this section.The training/test data used in tile ext)erimentcontained over one thousand simple Japanese sen-tences collected from slews articles.
The examplesgiven by IPAL were also used as training data s.!
),ach of tile sentences in the training/test dataused in our experiment consisted of one or morecomplement(s) followed by one of the ten verbsenumerated in table 2.
For each of the ten verbs,we conducted six-fold cross validation; that is, wedivided the training/test data into six equal parts,and conducted six trials in each of which a differ-ent one of the six parts was used as test data andthe rest was used as training data.
We shall callthe former the "test set" and the latter the "train-ing set," in each (:ase.When inore than one interpretation of an inputverb is assigned the highest t)lausibility score, anyof the above methods will (;hoose as its outt)ut theone that appears most frequently in the trainingdata.
Therefore, tile applicability in each methodis 100%, given that the applicability is tile ratioof the number of the cases where the system Rivesonly one intert)retation, to the numt)er of inputs.Thus, in tile ext)eriment, we compared the preci-sion of each method, which is in our case equal tothe ratio of the nuinber of correct outputs, to tilenulnt)er of int)uts.Since tile 1)erformance of any corpus-basedmethod depends on the size of training data, wetirst investigated how the precision of each methodwas improved as the training data increased.
Inthis, we initially used only the examples given byIPAL, and progressively increased the size of thetraining data used, by considering an extra partof the training set (five parts of the total six dataportions used) at each iteration, until finally tak-ing all five l)arts in the training of our system.4Note that., in equation (5), while SIM is an integer,PlSSI/.
ranges in its value h'om 0 to 1.
Therefore, II, SSI{,is influential only when several verb senses take thesame value of SIM for a given ease.
'~The number of examples given by IPAL was, on~verage, :1.7 for each ease of each case frame.The results are shown in figure 5, in which thex-axis denotes the ratio of the data used froln thetraining set, to tile total size of the training set.85 I I i 'i J !

(liven the whole trainingset, the precision improved from 75.2% to 82.4%(7.2% gain).
Third, the introduction of the notionof RSSR did not fltrther improve on the inethodusing only CCD.Table 2 shows tile performance for each verbon using the whole training set.
The column of"lower bound" denotes tile precision gained in anaive method such that the system always choosestile interpretation most frequently al)pearing inthe training data (Gale et al, 1992).
Tile col-umn of "two highest CCD" gives the two highestCCD values from the cases for each verb, whichare calculated using whole training set.Finally, let us see to what extent we should al-.low CCD to influence verb sense disambiguation.Figure 6 shows the performance with the paramet-ric constant ~ in equation (6) set to w~rious val-ues.
c~ = (/ corresponds with Kurohashi's method,in which CCD is never considered.
As shown infigure 6, the stronger influence we allow CCD tohave, the better performance we gain.6 Conc lus ionIn this paper, we proposed a slew example-basedmethod for verb sense (tisambiguation, which lin-t)roved the performance of the existing method byconsidering the degree of contribution of case toverb sense disambigu~tion.The performance ofour method significantly de-pends on the method of assigning degree of sim-ilarity to a t)air of case fillers.
Since Bunr'i~itloi-hyou is fundamentally based on human intuition,it does not reflect the similarity between a pairof case fillers computationaly.

)can 1)otentially be used ill conjunction with ourmethod to overcome this human reliance.In our current implenmntat ion,  we consider thecol location between case fillers and verbs, but ig-nore the combinat ion of case fillers.
Instead of adatabase as in figure 1, we could store a set of com-binat ions of example case fillers, e.g.
the combina-tion of s~wi ("pickpocket")  and saifu ("wallet"),but not that  of suri and otoko ("man") .
Itow-ever, this way of data  storage would require thecollection of a much larger number of examplesthan the current method.
This issue needs to befl~rther investigated.AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank Dr. Man-aim Okumura (JAIST, Japan), Dr. MichaelZock (LIMSI, France) and Mr. Timothy Baldwin(TITech, Jat)an) for their comments on the earlierversion of this paper.Re ferencesPeter F.
