Proceedings of the 13th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDIAL), page 197,Seoul, South Korea, 5-6 July 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsCohesion, Entrainment and Task Success in Educational DialogDiane LitmanDepartment of Computer Science and LRDCUniversity of PittsburghPittsburgh, PA 15260litman@cs.pitt.eduResearchers often study dialog corpora to better understand what makes some dialogs more successful thanothers.
In this talk I will examine the relationship between coherence/entrainment and task success, inseveral types of educational dialog corpora: 1) one-on-one tutoring, where students use dialog to interactwith a human tutor in the physics domain, 2) one-on-one tutoring, where students instead interact witha spoken dialog system, and 3) engineering design, where student teams engage in multi-party dialog tocomplete a group project.
I will first introduce several corpus-based measures of both lexical and acoustic-prosodic dialog cohesion and entrainment, and extend them to handle multi-party conversations.
I will thenshow that the amount of cohesion and/or entrainment positively correlates with measures of educational tasksuccess in all of our corpora.
Finally, I will discuss how we are using our findings to build better tutorialdialog systems.197
