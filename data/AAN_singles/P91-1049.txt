Non-Literal Word Sense Identification Through Semantic NetworkPath SchemataEric lverson, Stephen HelmreichComputing Research Lab and Computer Science I~panmentBox 30001/3CRLNew Mexico State Unive~tyLas Cruc~, NM 88003-0001When computer programs disambiguate wordsin a sentence, they often encounter non-literal ornovel usages not included in their lexicon.
In arecent study, Georgia Green (personal communica-tion) estimated that 17% to 20% of the content wordsenses encountered in various types of normalEnglish text are not fisted in the dictionary.
Whilethese novel word senses are generally valid, theyoccur in such great numbers, and with such littleindividual frequency that it is impractical to expli-city include them all within the lexicon.
Instead,mechanisms are needed which can derive novelsenses from existing ones; thus allowing a programto recognize a significant set of potential word senseswhile keeping its lexicon within a reasonable size.Spreading activation is a mechanism thatallows us to do this.
Here the program follows pathsfrom existing word senses tored in a semantic net-work to other closely associated word senses.
Byexamining the shape of the resultant path, we candetermine the relationship between the senses con-~ned in the path; thus deriving novel compositemeanings not contained within any of the originallexical entries.
This process is similar to the spread-ing activation and marker passing techniques of Hirst\[1988\], Charniak \[1986\], and Norvig \[1989\] and isembodied in the Prolog program metallel based onFass' program meta5 (Fass \[1988\]).Metallel's lexicon is written as a series ofsense frames, each containing information about aparticular word sense.
A sense frame can he brokeninto two main parts: genera and differentiae.
Gen-era are the genus terms that function as the ancestorsof a word sense.
Differentiae denote the qualitiesthat distinguish a particular sense from other sensesof the same genus.
Differentiae can be broken downinto source and target which hold, respectively, thepreferences t and properties of a sense.
Source con-=dns differentiae mform~on concen~g anotherword sense.
Target infocma~on concerns the senseitself.Connections can be found to other word sensesin one of two ways: through an ancestor relationship(genus) er through a preference or property relation-ship (differentia).
In the case of differentiae, it isnecessary to extract he word senses from a higherorder structure.
For example, \ [ i t  (n, z),conta in  (v, l ) ,  n~asic (n,  Z) \] is not a word sens?~at is LL~ted in the lexicon, while ~as ic  (n, i) isUs~L It is therefore necessary to ex~actrausic (n,Z) from the larger dfffereada s~ucmrewhich it occurs and add it to the path.Not all paths are valid, indicating that somecriteria of acceptability are needed uring analysis.In addition, paths that are superficially different oftenend up being quite similar upon further analysis.Keeping this in mind, we have attempted to identifypath schemata and associate them wkh types of non-literal usage.
Specifically, we have concentrated onidentifying instances of metaphor and metonymy.A metaphorical path schema is one in whichthe preference of a verb and the actual target of thepreference both reference different 3 place differen-tiae 2 which can be said to be related.

Thus, an analogy existsbetween ploughing soil and sailing water;, suggestinga new sense of plough that combines aspects of beth.Denise drank the bottle.den ise  (n, 1) -anc ->woman (n, 1} -prop->\[sex (n, i), \[female (aj# I) \] \] - l ink->female (aJ, i) -obj->animal (n, I) <-agent-drink (v, i) -obj->drink (n # 1 } -ant->liquid(n, 1) <- l ink~lit (n, 1 ), contain (v, I), l iquid (n, I) \] <-prop-bott le (n, 1}A metonymic path is indicated when a path isfound from a target sense through one of its inheriteddifferentiae; thus linking the original sense to arelated sense through a property or preference rela.tionship.
For example in the sen~nce Denise drankthe bottle, one of the properties of bot t le  (n, 1) is\[it (n, 1), contain (v, 1), l iquid (n, 1) 1.This differealia llows us to derive a novel meto-nymic word sense for bottle in which the bottle'sconwmts are denoted rather than the boule itself.Under memUel, any differentia can act as a conduitfor a memnymy; thus facilitating the generation ofnovel metonymies a  well as novel word senses.By using semantic network path schemata toidentify instances of non-literal usage, we haveexpanded the power of our program without doing soat the expense of a larger lexicon.
In addition, bykeeping our semantic relationship and path schemacriteria at a general evel, we hope to be able tocover a wide variety of different semantic taxo-nomies.ReferencesClmmi~, E 1986.
