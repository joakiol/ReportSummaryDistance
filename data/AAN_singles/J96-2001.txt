Estimating Lexical Priors forLow-Frequency MorphologicallyAmbiguous FormsHarald Baayen*Max Planck Institute forPsycholinguisticsRichard Sproat*Bell LaboratoriesGiven a form that is previously unseen in a sufficiently large training corpus, and that is mor-phologically n-ways ambiguous (serves n different lexical functions) what is the best estimatorfor the lexical prior probabilities for the various functions of the form?
We argue that the bestestimator is provided by computing the relative frequencies of the various functions among thehapax legomena--the forms that occur exactly once in a corpus; in particular, a hapax-basedestimator isbetter than one based on the proportion of the various functions among words of allfrequency ranges.
As we shall argue, this is because when one computes an overall measure, one isincluding high-frequency words, and high-frequency words tend to have idiosyncratic propertiesthat are not at all representative ofthe much larger mass of(productively formed) low-frequencywords.
This result has potential importance for various kinds of applications requiring lexicaldisambiguation, i cluding, in particular, stochastic taggers.
This is especially true when someinitial hand-tagging ofa corpus is required:for predicting lexical priors for very low-frequer~cymorphologically ambiguous types (most of which would not occur in any given corpus), oneshould concentrate on tagging a good representative sample of the hapax legomena, rather thanextensively tagging words of all frequency ranges.1.
IntroductionAs a number of writers on morphology have noted (most recently and notably Beard\[1995\]), it is common to find that a particular affix or other morphological markerserves more than one function in a language.
For example, in many morphologicallycomplex languages it is often the case that several slots in a paradigm are filled withthe same form; put in another way, it is common to find that a particular morphologi-cal form is in fact ambiguous between several distinct functions.
This phenomenon--which in the domain of inflectional morphology is termed syncretism---can be illus-trated by a Dutch example such as lopen 'walk', which can either be the infinitive form('to walk') or the finite plural (present tense) form ('we, you, or they walk').
In somecases, syncretism is completely systematic: for example the case cited in Dutch, wherethe -en suffix can always function in the two ways cited; or in Latin, where the pluraldative and ablative forms of nouns and adjectives are always identical, no matter whatparadigm the noun belongs to.
In other cases, a particular instance of syncretism aybe displayed only in some paradigms: for example, Russian feminine norms, such asloshad' 'horse' (Cyrillic aoma~b), have the same form for both the genitive singular* Wundtlaan 1,6525 XD, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

E-mail: rws@research.att.com(D 1996 Association for Computational LinguisticsComputational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 2- -  loshadi (Cyrillic aoma~i4) - -  and the nominative plural, whereas masculine nounstypically distinguish these forms.
In still other cases, the syncretism ay be partial inthat two forms may be identical at one level of representation - -  say, orthography - -but not another - -  say, pronunciation.
For example the written form goroda in Rus-sian (Cyrillic ropo~a) may either be the nominative plural or the genitive singular of'city'.
In the genitive singular, the stress is on the first syllable (/g%rodA/), whereasin the nominative plural the stress resides on the final syllable (/gorAd~a/); note thatthe difference in stress results in very different vowel qualities for the two forms, asindicated in the phonetic transcriptions.Syncretism and related morphological ambiguities present a problem for manyNL applications where lexical disambiguation is important; cases where the ortho-graphic form is identical but the pronunciations of the various functions differ areparticularly important for speech applications, such as text-to-speech, since appro-priate word pronunciations must be computed from orthographic forms that under-specify the necessary information.
Ideally one would like to build models that usecontextual information to perform lexical disambiguation (Yarowsky 1992, 1994), butsuch models must be trained on specialized tagged corpora (either hand-generatedor semi-automatically generated) and such training corpora are often not available, atleast in the early phases of constructing a particular application.
Lacking good contex-tual models, one is forced to fall back on estimates of the lexical prior probabilities forthe various functions of a form.
Following standard terminology, a lexical prior can bedefined as follows: Imagine that a given form is n-ways ambiguous; the lexical priorprobability of sense i of this form is simply the probability of sense i independent ofthe context in which the particular instantiation of the form occurs.
Assuming onehas a tagged corpus, one can usually get reasonable stimates of the lexical priorsfor the frequent forms (such as Dutch lopen 'walk') by simply counting the numberof times the form occurs in each of its various functions and dividing by the totalnumber of instances of the form (in any function).
This yields the Maximum Like-lihood Estimate (MLE) for the lexical prior probability.
But for infrequent or unseenforms, it is less clear how to compute the estimate.
Consider another Dutch examplelike aanlokken 'entice, appeal'.
This form occurs only once, as an infinitive, in the Uitden Boogaart (henceforth UdB) corpus (Uit den Boogaart 1975); in other words it is ahapax legomenon (< Greek hapax 'once', legomenon 'said') in this corpus.
Obviouslythe lexical prior probability of this form expressing the finite plural is not zero, theMLE is a poor estimate in such cases.
When one considers forms that do not occurin the training corpus (e.g., bedraden 'to wire') the situation is even worse.
The prob-lem, then, is to provide a more reasonable stimate of the relative probabilities of thevarious potential functions of such forms.
12.
Estimating the Lexical Priors for Rare FormsFor a common form such as lopen 'walk' a reasonable stimate of the lexical priorprobabilities i  the MLE, computed over all occurrences of this form.
So, in the UdBcorpus, lopen occurs 92 times as an infinitive and 43 times as a finite plural, so the MLE1 Even models of disambiguation that make use of context, such as statistical n-gram taggers, oftenpresume some estimate of lexical priors, in addition to requiring estimates of the transitionprobabilities of sequences of lexical tags (Church 1988; DeRose 1988; Kupiec 1992), and this againbrings up the question of what to do about unseen or low-frequency forms.
In working taggers, acommon approach is simply to apply a uniform small probability to the various senses of unseen orlow-frequency forms: this was done in the tagger discussed in Church (1988), for example.156Baayen and Sproat Lexical Priors for Low-Frequency Formsto.>"8Figure 1I I I I0 2 4 6log frequency classRelative frequency of Dutch infinitives versus finite plurals in the Uit den Boogaart corpus, asa function of the (natural) log of the frequency of the word forms.
The horizontal solid linerepresents he overall MLE, the relative frequency of the infinitive as computed over alltokens; the horizontal dashed line represents he relative frequency of the infinitive among thehapax legomena.
The solid curve represents a locally weighted regression smoothing(Cleveland 1979).estimate of the probability of the infinitive is 0.68.
For low-frequency forms such asaanlokken or bedraden, one might consider basing the MLE on the aggregate counts of allambiguous forms in the corpus.
In the UdB corpus, there are 21,703 infinitive tokens,and 9,922 finite plural tokens, so the MLE for aanlokken being an infinitive would be0.69.
Note, however, that the application of this overall MLE presupposes that therelative frequencies of the various functions of a particular form are independent ofthe frequency of the form itself.
For the Dutch example at hand, this presuppositionpredicts that if we were to classify -en forms according to their frequency, and then foreach frequency class thus defined, plot the relative frequency of infinitives and finiteplurals, the regression line should have a slope of approximately zero.2.1 Dutch Verb Forms in -enFigure 1 shows that this prediction is not borne out.
This scatterplot shows the relativefrequency of the infinitive versus the finite plural, as a function of the log-frequencyof the -en form.
At the left-hand edge of the graph, the relative frequency of the in-finitives for the hapax legomena is shown.
This proportion is also highlighted by thedashed horizontal line.
As we proceed to the right, we observe that there is a generaldownward curvature representing a lowering of the proportion of infinitives for the157Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 2higher-frequency words.
This trend is captured by the solid nonparametric regressionline; an explanation for this trend will be forthcoming in Section 3.
(It will be noted thatin Figure 1 the variance is fairly small for the lower-frequency ranges, higher for themiddle ranges, and then small again for the high-frequency ranges; anticipating some-what, we note the same trends in Figures 2 and 3.
This variance pattern follows fromthe high variability in the absolute numbers of types realized, especially in the middlelog-frequency classes, in combination with the assumption that for any log-frequencyclass, the proportion for that class is itself a random variable.)
The solid horizontal linerepresents the proportion of infinitives calculated over all frequency classes, and thedashed horizontal line represents the proportion of infinitives calculated over just thehapax legomena.
The two horizontal lines can be interpreted as MLEs for the proba-bility of an -en form being an infinitive: the solid line or overall MLE clearly providesan estimate based on the whole population, whereas the dashed line or hapax-basedMLE provides an estimate for the hapaxes.
The overall MLE computes a lower rel-ative frequency for the infinitives, compared to the hapax-based MLE.
The question,then, is: Which of these MLEs provides a better estimate for low-frequency t pes?
Inparticular, for types that have not been seen in the training corpus, and for which wetherefore have no direct estimate of the word-specific prior probabilities, we wouldlike to know whether the hapax-based or overall MLE provides a better estimate.To answer this question we compared the accuracy of the overall and hapax-basedMLEs using tenfold cross-validation.
We first randomized the list of -en tokens fromthe UdB corpus, then divided the randomized list into ten equal-sized parts.
Each ofthe ten parts was held out as the test set, and the remaining nine-tenths was used asthe training set over which the two MLE estimates were computed.
The results areshown in Table 1.
In this table, No(inf) and No(pl) represent the observed number oftokens of infinitives and plurals in the held-out portion of the data, representing typesthat had not been seen in the training data.
The final four rows compare the estimatesfor these numbers of tokens given the overall MLE (EoINo(infl\] and Eo\[No(pl)\]), versusthe hapax-based MLE (Eh\[No(inf)\] and Eh\[No(pl)\]).
For all ten runs, the hapax-basedMLE is clearly a far better predictor than the overall MLE.
22.2 English Verb Forms in -edThe pattern that we have observed for the Dutch infinitive-plural ambiguity can bereplicated for other cases of morphological ambiguity.
Consider the case of Englishverbs ending in -ed, which are systematically ambiguous between being simple pasttenses and past participles.
The upper panel of Figure 2 shows the distribution ofthe relative frequencies of the two functions, plotted against the natural log of thefrequency for the Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera 1982).
(All lines, including thenonparametric regression line are interpretable as in Figure 1.)
Results of a tenfoldcross-validation are shown in Table 2.
Clearly, in this case the magnitude of the dif-ference between the overall MLE and the hapax-based MLE is smaller than in theprevious example: indeed in cross validations 6, 8, and 9, the overall MLE is superior.Nonetheless, the hapax-based MLE remains a significantly better predictor overall.
32 A paired t-test on the ratios No(inf)/No(pl) versus Eo\[No(inf)\]/Eo\[No(pl)\] reveals a highly significantdifference (t9 = 13.4, p < 0.001 ); conversely a comparison of No (inf)/No (pl) and E h \[No (inf)\]/Eh \[No (pl)\]reveals no difference (t9 = 0.96,p > 0.10).3 A paired t-test on the ratios No(vbn)/No(vbd) versus Eo\[No(vbn)\]/Eo\[No(vbd)\] reveals a significantdifference (t9 -~ 2.47,p < 0.05); conversely a comparison of No(vbn)/No(vbd ) andEh\[No(vbn)\]/E h\[No (vbd)\] reveals no difference (t 9 = 0.48, p > 0.10).158Baayen and Sproat Lexical Priors for Low-Frequency FormsTable 1Results of tenfold cross-validation for Dutch -en verb forms from the Uit den Boogaart corpus.Columns represent different cross-validation runs.

This does not hold generally, however, and the bottom panel of Figure 2presents a case where the hapax-based MLE does yield a different prediction as towhich function is more likely.
In this plot we consider Dutch word forms from theUdB corpus ending in -en.
As we have seen, Dutch -en is used as a verb marker: itmarks the infinitive, present plural, and for strong verbs, also the past plural; it isalso used as a marker of noun plurals.
The case of noun plurals is somewhat differentfrom the preceding two cases since it is not, strictly speaking, a case of morphologicalsyncretism.
However, it is a potential source of ambiguity in text analysis, since a lowfrequency form in -en, where one may not have seen the stem of the word, couldpotentially be either a noun or a verb.
Also, systematic ambiguity exists among casesof noun-verb conversion: for examplefluiten is either a noun meaning 'flutes' or a verbmeaning 'to play the flute'; spelden means either 'pins' or 'to pin'; and ploegen meanseither 'ploughs' or 'to plough'.
Results for a tenfold cross-validation for these data areshown in Table 3.
4 Lrl this case, the overall MLE would lead one to predict that foran unseen form in -en, the verbal function would be more likely.
Contrariwise, thehapax-based MLE predicts that the nominal function would be more likely.
Again, itis the hapax-based MLE that proves to be superior.4 A paired t-test on the ratios No(v)/No(n) versus Eo\[No(v)\]/Eo\[No(n)\] reveals ahighly significantdifference (t9 = 95.95,p <~ 0.001); conversely a comparison ofNo(v)/No(n) and Eh\[No(v)\]/Eh\[No(n)\]reveals no difference (t 9 = 0.12,p > 0.10).159Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 2English -edz>00eq,?-Oo.OOo.O.

Since monomorphemic nouns and adjectives in this class are mostlydisyllabic, we will restrict our attention to the disyllabic instances of words endingin -er.
Again we find that the hapax-based MLE is superior to the overall MLE forpredicting to which of these five categories an unseen disyllabic word belongs.Table 4 lists the overall MLE, the hapax-based MLE and the statistics on whichthese estimates are based; Figure 3 plots the corresponding proportions as a function oflog-frequency.
Table 4 also lists the results of tenfold cross-validation by specifying, foreach category, its contribution to the X2-statistic summing Over the ten cross-validationruns.
(A more condensed format was chosen for this table than for the previous tables,since here we are dealing with a fivefold ambiguity; the previous format would haveresulted in a rather large table in the present case.)
Clearly, predictions based on the161Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 2Table 4Results of tenfold cross-validation for Dutch disyllabic -er  words.
N and N1 are the number oftokens and number of hapax legomena in the Uit den Boogaart corpus for simplex andcomplex adjectives and nouns, and proper names.
OMLE and HMLE are, respectively, theoverall and hapax-based MLEs based on N and N1.
For each category, the columns headed byX2(OMLE) and X2(HMLE) list the summed contribution to the X2-measures over tencross-validation runs for the overall and hapax-based estimates.String type N N1 OMLE HMLE X2(OMLE) X2(HMLE)Simplex noun in -er  2,157 43 0.438 0.206 46.52 1.63Derived noun in -er  581 51 0.118 0.244 32.02 1.94Simplex adjective in -er  486 6 0.099 0.029 18.22 14.90Derived adjective in -er  1,409 41 0.286 0.196 14.97 9.05Proper name in -er  291 68 0.059 0.325 361.22 5.984,924 209 1.000 1.000 462.97 33.50hapax-based MLE are superior to those based on the overall MLE (X~36) = 462.97, p <.001 for the overall MLE, X 2 = 33.50, p > .5 for the hapax-based MLE).
In particular, (36)proper names in -e r  have a much higher probability of occurrence than the overallMLE would suggest.
Of course, in orthography-based applications, one can rely tosome extent on capitalization to indicate proper names, so one might want to eliminatethose from consideration here on this basis.
Removing the category of proper namesfrom the analysis, a cross-validation test again reveals significantly better predictionsfor the hapax-based MLE (X~27) = 43.61, p = .023) than for the overall MLE (X~27) =120.03,p < .001).2.5 SummaryWe have demonstrated with four separate xamples that the hapax-based MLE is su-perior to the overall MLE in predicting the proportions, among unseen forms, of thevarious functions of morphologically ambiguous categories.
Could an even better es-timator be obtained by taking not only the proport ion for the hapax legomena intoaccount but also the proportions for other low-log-frequency lasses?
To answer thisquestion, note that the scatterplot in the bottom panel of Figure 2 reveals a down-ward curvature at the very left-hand side: even for the lowest-log-frequency classes,the likelihood of a word being a verb decreases with decreasing log-frequency.
Thissuggests that for this particular example the hapax legomena lone should be used toestimate the probability that an unseen word is a noun or verb, rather than the hapaxlegomena in combination with other low-frequency classes (the words occurring twice,three times, etc.).
Interestingly, the top panel of Figure 2 does not reveal even a hint ofa trend among the lowest-log-frequency classes, and in Figure 1 the observed propor-tions for log-frequency less than 2 also do not reveal a clear pattern.
For Figure 3, cleartrends for the lower-log-frequency lasses seem to obtain in all cases except he plotshowing the proportion of simplex adjectives.
Taken jointly, these observations suggestinformally that an MLE based on the hapax legomena will never be inferior to MLEsthat take additional log-frequency classes at the lower end of the log-frequency rangeinto account.
At the same time, the example of Dutch verb and noun forms in -ensuggests that the hapax-based MLE can be superior to such MLEs-- in this particularcase, inclusion of these lower-frequency lasses would bring the adjusted MLE morein line with the overall MLE, resulting in a loss of accuracy.
These considerations leadus to conclude that the hapax-based MLE is to be preferred to an adjusted MLE thatincludes other low-log-frequency lasses.162Baayen and Sproat Lexical Priors for Low-Frequency FormstoO0 ?

Five types of words are distinguished: monomorphemicwords in -er (moeder, 'mother'); bimorphemic nouns in -er (schrijver, 'writer'); monomorphemicadjectives in -er (donker, 'dark'); bimorphemic adjectives in -er (groter, 'greater'); and propernames in -er (Pieter, 'Peter').

D iscuss ionAs we have seen in the four examples discussed above, the MLE computed over hapaxlegomena yields a better prediction of lexical prior probabilities for unseen cases thandoes an MLE computed over the entire training corpus.
We now have to considerwhy this result holds.
As we shall see, the reasons are different from case to case, butnonetheless share a commonality: in all four cases, idiosyncratic lexical properties ofhigh-frequency words dominate the statistical properties of the high-frequency ranges,thus making the overall MLE a less reliable predictor of the properties of the low-frequency and unseen cases.First let us discuss the final case, that of -er ambiguity in Dutch, beginning with thederived and underived nouns.
The hapax-based MLE estimate for derived nouns in-er is somewhat higher than the overall MLE; for underived nouns, the hapax-basedMLE is significantly lower - -  half - -  of the overall MLE.
This can be explained bythe observation that a good many of the underived nouns in -er are high-frequencywords such as moeder 'mother'  and vader 'father'.
Such words contribute to the overallproportional mass of the underived nouns, thus boosting the estimate of the overallMLE for this class.
A similar argument holds for the derived and underived adjectives.Turning to proper names, we see that the hapax-based MLE is much larger than theoverall MLE.
Proper names differ from ordinary words in that there are relatively few163Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 2proper names that are highly frequent, in comparison with words in general, but thereare large numbers of types of names that occur rarely.
Thus, we expect an imbalanceof the kind we observe.Consider next the ambiguity in Dutch between -en verb forms and -en pluralnouns.
Ceteris paribus, plural nouns are less frequent han singular nouns; on theother hand, -en for verbs serves both the function of marking plurality and of markingthe infinitive.
High-frequency verbs include some very common word forms, such asthe auxiliaries hebben 'have', zullen 'will', kunnen 'can', and moeten 'must'.
Thus, for thehigh-frequency ranges, the data is weighted heavily towards verbs.
On the other hand,while both nouns and verbs are open classes, nouns are far more productive as a classthan are verbs (Baayen and Lieber 1991), and this pattern becomes predominant in thelow-frequency ranges: among low-frequency t pes, most tokens are nouns.
Hence, forthe low-frequency ranges, the data is weighted towards nouns.
These two opposingforces conspire to yield a downward trend in the percentage of verbs as we proceedfrom the high- to the low-frequency ranges.Next, consider the English past tense versus past participle ambiguity.
One of theimportant functions of the past participle form is as an adjectival modifier or predicate;for example, the parked car.
In this function the past participle has a passive meaningwith transitive verbs, and a perfective meaning with unaccusative intransitive verbs;see Levin (1993, 86-88) for details.
For reasons that are not clear to us, a predomi-nant number of the high-frequency verbs cannot felicitously be used as prenominaladjectives.
These verbs include unergative intransitives like walk, for which one wouldnot expect o find the adjectival usage, given the above characterization; but they alsoinclude clear transitives like move, try, and ask, and unaccusative intransitives like ap-pear, which are not generally felicitous in this usage.
Consider: ?a moved car, ?a triedapproach, ?an asked question, ?an appeared ad; but contrast: an oft-tried approach, afrequentlyasked question, a recently appeared ad, where an adverbial modifier enders the examplesfelicitous.
5 Among the low-frequency verbs, including accentuate, bottle and incense, thepredominate types are those in which the past participle usage is preferred.
What isclear from the plot in the top panel of Figure 2 is that the downward trend in theregression curve to the right of the plot is due to the lexical properties of a relativelysmall number of high-frequency verbs.
For the greater part of the frequency range,there is a relatively stable proportion of participles to finite past forms.
Thus, thehapax-based MLE yields an estimate that is uncontaminated by the lexical propertiesof individual high-frequency forms.Finally, consider the Dutch verb forms -en that we started with.
In Figure 1 thestrong downward trend in the regression curve at the right of the figure is due inlarge measure to the inclusion of high-frequency auxiliary verbs, examples of whichhave already been given.
These verbs, while possible in the infinitival form, occurpredominantly in the finite form.
Hence, a form such as hebben 'have' is much morelikely to be a plural finite form than it is to be an infinitive.
At the low end of thefrequency spectrum, we find a great many verbs derived with separable particles,such as afzeggen 'cancel'; note that separable prefixation is the most productive verb-forming process in Dutch.
In the infinitival form, the particle is always attached to5 One reviewer has suggested that the infelicity of many adjectival passives relates to the fact hat theaction denoted by the base verb is not regarded as producing an enduring result hat affects the objectdenoted by the (deep) internal argument: contrast a broken vase, where the vase is enduringly affectedby the breaking, with ?a seen movie, where the movie is not affected.
However, this cannot be the wholestory since the object denoted by the internal argument ofkill is presumably enduringly affected by thekilling, yet ?a killed man seems about as odd as ?a seen movie.164Baayen and Sproat Lexical Priors for Low-Frequency Formsthe verb.
However, in the finite forms in main clauses, the particle must be separated:for example, wij zeggen onze afspraak af 'we are cancelling our appointment'.
Theseproperties of Dutch separable verbs boost the likelihood of infinitival forms for thelow-frequency ranges, but they also boost the likelihood of (higher-frequency) finiteplural forms such as zeggen: since the separated finite plural form zeggen is identicalto the finite plural of the underived verb zeggen 'say', any separated finite forms willaccrue to the frequency of the generally much more common derivational base.What all of these cases share is that the statistical properties of the high-frequencyranges are dominated by lexical properties of particular sets of high-frequency words.This in turn biases the overall MLE and makes it a poor predictor of novel cases.For example, auxiliaries uch as hebben 'have' are among the most common verbs inDutch, but they have rather different syntactic, and hence morphological, propertiesfrom other verbs; these properties in turn contaminate the high-frequency ranges andthus the overall MLE.
In contrast, words in the low-frequency ranges, and particu-larly hapaxes, are heavily populated with (necessarily non-idiosyncratic) neologismsderived via productive morphological processes (Baayen 1989; Baayen and Renouf1996).
Any lexical biases that are inherent in these morphological processes - -  forexample, the fact that a low frequency Dutch word ending in -en is more likely tobe a noun than a verb - -  are well-estimated by the hapaxes.
Now, for a sufficientlylarge training corpus, we can be very confident hat an unseen complex word is non-idiosyncratic and formed via a productive morphological process, and this confidenceincreases as the corpus size increases (Baayen and Renouf 1996).
Since the hapaxes of aparticular morphological process mostly consist of non-idiosyncratic formations fromthat process, it makes sense that the distribution of a property among the hapaxes isthe least contaminated estimate available for the distribution of that property amongthe unseen cases.The hapax-based MLE that we have proposed is not only observationally prefer-able to the overall MLE, it is also firmly grounded in probability theory.
The probabilityof encountering an unseen word given that this word is a word in -en is estimated by:N1,N(-en)Pr(unseen\[-en) ~ N(_en) , (1)where N1,N(-en) denotes the number of hapax legomena in -en among the N(-en) tokensin -en in the training sample; see Baayen (1989), Baayen and Lieber (1991), Good (1953),and Church and Gale (1991).
Of course, this estimate is heavily influenced by thehighest-frequency words in -en, as these words contribute many tokens to N(-en).
In ourexample, high-frequency auxiliaries uch as hebben cause the probability of samplingunseen types in -en to be low - -  newly sampled tokens have a high probability ofbeing an auxiliary rather than some previously unseen word.
Interestingly, (1) can beused to derive an expression for the conditional probability that a word is, say, a noun,given that it is an unseen type in -en (Baayen 1993):Pr(noun A unseen -en type) (2)Pr(noun \[ unseen -en type) = Pr(unseen-en type)NLN(-en , noun)N(-en)Nl,t~(-en )N(-en)N1,N(-en, noun)N1,N(-en)Note that the estimator exemplified in (1) has been applied twice: once (in the de-165Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 2nominator) to the distribution of all -en words; and once (in the numerator) to thedistribution of the -en nouns - -  after reclassifying all verbal tokens in -en as represent-ing one (very high-frequency) noun type in the frequency distribution.
Similarly, theprobability that an unseen word in -en is a verb is given byN1,N(-en, verb)Pr(verb I unseen -en type) ~ N1,N(-en) (3)Thus the proportion of verbal hapaxes in -en that we have suggested as an adjustedMLE estimator on the basis of the curve shown in Figure 2 is in fact an estimate of theconditional probability that a word is a verb, given that it is an unseen type in -en.The results of the analyses presented in this paper are of potential importancein various applications that require lexical disambiguation and where an estimateof lexical priors is required.
For high-frequency words, one can obtain fairly reliableestimates of the lexical priors by tagging a corpus that gives a good coverage to wordsof various ranges.
For predicting the lexical priors for the much larger mass of verylow-frequency t pes, most of which would not occur in any such corpus, the results wehave presented suggest hat one should concentrate on tagging a good representativesample of the hapaxes, rather than extensively tagging words of all frequency ranges.AcknowledgmentsThe authors wish to thank four anonymousreviewers for Computational Linguistics foruseful comments on this paper.ReferencesBaayen, Harald.
