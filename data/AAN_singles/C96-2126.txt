Given the textualinformation explosion (in particular in, though notrestricted to, specialized omains) there is an urgentneed for tools enabling to exploit the informationavailable in natural language texts.
MULTITALEhas been devised therefore primarily with the aim tomake explicit semantic information in medical texts,which should lead to more refined informationretrieval results.
By making "educated guesses" thesystem moreover has a possibility to expand its ownlexicon of medical terms so to be able to cope withnew texts.I.
INTRODUCTIONMULTITALE has been developed as part of an EU project(MLAP 93-04) which has been started in 1994 and hasbeen completed recently.
The F, nglish part of it wascarried out by the Belgian partner" (Office Line EngineeringNV, Zonnegcm; RAM1T, Gent) , the Dutch part by theDutch partner (Lexicology Research Group, FreeUniversity Amsterdam1).
Although both groups share thesame starting point and objectives, the methods lbllowedshow some idiosyncracies, thercibre if in what followsMUITI'ITALE is mentioned, actually the MULTITAI,El)utch module is meant.11.
SEMANTIC  MODELThe senmntic tagging is based on the CEN/TC251-modelfor Surgical Procedures (CEN,1994).
This model is aclassification and coding system of medical procedures.It distinguishes the following concept types:CC_Surgical Deed (indicating the surgical intervention),CC_Anatomy (indicating anatomical concepts),CC Pathology (indicating pathological concepts),CC Interventional Equipment (indicating the instrument),CC Combi (a term which has a medical meaning only iracombination with another-medical- term),r T. 1,'rizzanin (syntax), A. Kramer (lexicon), 1.
Maks (syntax andsemantics), W. Martin (overall supervision)CC modifier_bodyside,CC_modifierextent,CC_modifier_number (terms which modit~?
other medicalterms.The Surgical deed concept is classified into 12 subtypes,among others: CS_remove, CS close, CS_create, CS close,CS install, CS make appear.
The Surgical decd conceptis considered as the nncleus of the surgical procedure andmay have different ypes of relationships with the other"medical concepts:the R Direct object indicates the object on which thesurgical deed is carried out;the R_Indirect_Object indicates the object o or from or inwhich the surgical deed is carried out;the R_Location indicates the place where the SurgicalDeed is carried out;the Rmeans indicates that with which the Surgical Deed iscarried out;the R nmnner indicates how the Surgical I)ecd is carriedout.The next example illustrates the CEN\TC251-model.The input is taken fl'om a report of a ncurosurgicalintervention; the output is generated by the MULTITALI,;system.(ex.

OVI<RAI,L ARCI l ITECTUREMUI/ IT I 'ALE SYSTEMOF TI lEThe MUI,TITAI,E system consists of 5 modules :1.
- A syntactic tagger and lcmmatizer for l)utch medicallanguage.2.
- A syntactic module lbr the lbrmation of minimal NPsand PPs.
'l'he syntactical module functions as apreprocessor.
As a consequence syntax is kept to aminimum and partial: only clause segmentation, verb-detection and NI'/PI' demarcation is considered to benecessary.3.
- A module for the attribution of concept ypc to theminimal NPs and PPs.
Given syntactical "chuncks" (verbs,NPs, PPs) within a certain space (ehmse), MUI/1TFALEtries to assign eolmepts to them.
The system is preferentialin that it has defined - based upon corpus observation andsublanguage modelling - a priority ranking/hierarchy ofconcepts when occurring in combination, to lbrm onecomplex concept.
This priority ranking/hierarchy looks asfollows:CC Surgical )eedCC_ l'athology(2C_ .lnterventional EquipmentCC AnatonayCC ColnbiIt governs the concept type calculus so that e.g.
in anexpression with a Surgical Deed, the latter overrules allother concepts as in rechler \]CC-Modifier-lk}dyside\]retromasloidale ICC-Anatomyl incisie \[CC-Surgicatdeed\].

Since theC\]:,N-model has much in common with Filhnore's CaseGrammar (Filhnore, 1968), Case grammar-like fi'ames fi)rthe implementation of the model have been used.
Casegrammar gives an analysis of a sentence, centered aroundlhe verb.
CEN gives an a,mlysis of a surgical procedure,centered arotmd the Surgical deed concept (which is oftena verb).

3)Het aneurysma wordt afgeelipt met een rechte clip.
(The aneurysm is cut off with a straight clip)Considering a sentence like example 3, the system has todecide which noun phrase can be related to the verb andwhat is the nature of that relationship.
The possibleSemantic Links correspond to the CEN Semantic Links.So, in relation to the verb afelippen (to cut off) we find -among others- Direct Object and Means.
Like for CaseGrammar, there are markers, like prepositions or the lackof prepositions, which point to a certain Semantic Link.In the above example, the preposition met (with) is anindicator for Means and it is the absence of a prepositionwhich points to the Direct Object.
For identifying theScmantic I,inks, three particular kinds of information areneeded:1. the surgical deed concept and its possible SemanticLinks2.
the NP and its concept type3.
the Prepositions and their values (l values).Frames are chosen for the implementation f themodel.
They have a top level which is fixed and representsthings that are true of a certain situation.
They have a lowerlevel with slots, conditions on the slots and fillers, whichrepresent things that are expected for a certain situation(Minsky, 1975).
As regards the top level, three differentkinds of frames are defined for Multitale.a.
standard surgical deed frame:LEXICAL ELEMENT surgical deed conceptPART OF SPEECIt verbCONCEPT TYPE CC_surgical_decdCONCEPT SUBTYPE subtype of CC_surgical_decd:CS..b. variant surgical deed frame:LEXICAL ELEMENT surgical deed conceptPART OF SPEECII nounCONCEPT TYPE CC-surgical-deedCONCEPT SUBTYPE subtype of CC surgical_deed :CS..c. non-surgical-deed frame:LEXICAL ELEMENT non-surgical-deed conceptPART OF SPEECH nounCONCEPT TYPE non_surgical-deed concept typeThe lower level of the non-surgical-deed frame will bediscussed below being different from the lower level ofboth the surgical-deed-frames.
The lower level of thesurgical deed frames contains sets of slots for theidentification of Semantic I,inks.
The set consists of a slot -called ROLE- for the type of Semantic Link, a slot -calledARG- lbr the pointer to the clement in the sentence whichis linked to the surgical deed concept, a slot -called CC -tbr the concept ype' of the element which is linked andfinally a slot -called IND- for the indication (I-value) of thefunction of the linked element.
Each slot can specifyconditions its filler must meet.slots:ROLEARGCCINDROI,Econditions on the fillers are marked with *'*one of the CEN-defincd Semantic Links*CEN-defincd concept types* l-valuesARGCC1NDROLl'2The conditions on the fillers are found in the surgical deedlexicon and the type lexicon.
The type lexicon givesgeneral information for the surgical deed subtype; thesurgical deed lexicon gives information for the individualtoken, the individual surgical deed concept.IV.2 THE L INK ING MODULE STEP BY STEPFor filling in the frame and analyzing the sentence, thesystem performs the following steps for each Surgical-deed-clause.(ex.

The link between thesetwo phrases is called post-modification link.
The slotPOS(ition) in combination with the constraint +1 requiresthat the postmodifying phrase directly tbllows the NP fi)rwhich this frame is defined.(ex.

THE GUESSING MODULEV.
1 INTRODUCTIONThe guessing module of the Multitale system deals withthe semi-automatic augmentation of the concept lexicons(=lexicons of surgical deeds and non- sm'gical deeds).
Theperformance of the tagger depends Rn" a great deal on thecompleteness of the lexicon.
If the lexicon does not containa medical term, the tagger cannot assign a semantic link tothis unknown term and another one in the sentence.
Theguessing module is an important help tbr the attgmentationof the concept lexicon, and consequently an important partof the Multitale system when tagging unknown texts.The lunction of the module is twofold:1.
- generation of a list of words which m'e likely to bemedical terms and CEN concepts.
The list does not presentjust a list of words unknown to the system but a selectionof words relevant to CEN.2.
- suggestions regarding the concept ype tbr each wordof the generated list.
The suggested concept types arc749CC_surgical_deed (without subtype) ,CCanatomy,CC~mthology, CC intervent equipment and CC_way.The module works semi-automatically: the list ofunknown words is generated in an automatic way, but theuser of the system has to decide whether the suggestion iscorrect or not before adding it to the lexicon.V.2 GUESSING NON-SURGICAL-DEEDCONCEPTSThe guessing module uses the frames of the linkingmodule.
For the guessing of the non-surgical-deedconcepts, it uses the constraints given tbr the fillers of theslots of the surgical deed frame.
The general rule is thefollowing: if a phrase (noun phrase or prepositional phrase)has a Semantic Link with a surgical deed concept, at leastone of the words of the phrase is a CEN- concept.
Supposea sentence contains a surgical deed concept, but the systemis not able to make a semantic link between the surgicaldeed concept and another concept in the surgical-deed-clause.
In most cases, this is due to the fact that theconcept ype of the terms is not known, for example:(ex.
8).. de tunor wordt verwo'derd..-de tumor CC-?-verwijderd CC surgical_deed CS remove(.. the turnout will be removed..)Suppose that tumor is not present in the lexicon, then thesystem is not able to meet the conditions of the slots ofverw(/deren and cannot indicate the R_directobject.
Thel__wflue of de tumor meets the required value for the slot<IND>, but none of the concept classes required for the<CC> slot can be matched.(ex.
8a)LI;XICAL ELEMENT verwij derdPART O1" SPEECH verbCONCEPT TYPE CC_surgical_deedCONCI{PT SUBTYPE CS removeROLE *R DIRECT ()BJECTARGCCIND*CC pathology/CC_combi/* CC_anatomy/*CC_intervent equipment*l NONEThe guessing module then 'relaxes' the conditions et andnow considers the syntactic function of a noun phrase or aprepositional phrase (expressed by its Ivalue) as asufficient indication for a semantic link.
In other words: ifthe I value of an element in the surgical-deed- clausesatifies one of the i+values rcquired for an <IND> slot,then the element will be linked.(ex.
8b)LEXICAL ELEMENT verwijderdPART OF SPEECII verbCONCEPT TYPE CC surgical_deedCONCEPT SUBTYPE CS removeIROLER DIRECT OBJECTARG -->de tumorCC ?IND i NONEThe next step is to make a guess about tbe concept ype ofthe filled-in element.
The constraints - CC pathology,CC_colnbi and CC_anatomy (see frame \]br verwijderen) -of the <CC> slot, are considered as good candidates.
To beable to make a choice for one of them, the constraints areconnected with priority numbers, obtained by corpusobservation:(ex.
8c)part of the entry CS remove of the type lexicon:priority number:<conceptClass> CC_surgical_deed<conceptSubclass>CSremove<rob R DIRECT OBJECTI I<cc 1 > CC_pathology 1<cc2> CC anatomy 2<cc3> CC_intervent_equipment 3<cc4> CC combi 2<prep I > I_NONE<rol>..The numbers are based on the occurrences of combinationsof concept types in the corpus.
These occurrences aretranslated into priority numbers for the constraints on the<CC> slots which are registered in the type and surgicaldeed lexicon?
The concept ype with the highest occurrence(in combination with the given surgical deed concept andthe given Semantic Link) was marked with the highestpriority number (namely 1).
The concept type with thehighest number is considered the most likely candidate forthe filled-in clement.
So, the system will suggest theconcept ype CC pathology lbr tumor in (ex.
8).
In mostcases the element, for which the concept ype is guessed,consists of more than one word:(ex.
9)?
om de laterale tumorale expansie te kunnen verwijderen..-de latcrale tumorale xpansieCC-?
R DIRECT OBJECT-verwijderen CC_surgical_deed CS remove(.. to be able to remove the tumoral expansion)The guessed concept ype is suggested for all the nounsand adjectives, being the meaningful words in the phrase.Words which have a meaning in general language aremarked <GEN>, to indicate that the guess is morcquestionable than in other cases.results of the guessing module for (ex.)
9:laterale CC_pathology?tmnorale CC_pathology?expansic CC_pathology?3"he suggestion is only correct for tumorale, whereaslaterale is of the type MC bodyside and expansie of theCC combi.
In a later phase we intend to correct thesecases of overgeneration.V.3 GUESSING SURGICAL DEED CONCEPTSThe general rule for the guessing of sm'gical deeds is: eachverb that has a Semantic Link with a CEN-concept, is a750surgical deed concept.
For finding the unknown surgicaldeed concepts, Multitale makes use of the fi'ames as well.For each verb in the text that is not in the concept lexicon,a frame is built.
This li'ame is called CS neutral, itssemantic onstraints - the allowed concept ypes - and itssyntactic onstraints - the I values - are less strict than theconstraints which have been specified for the frames of thesurgical deeds belonging to a specific snbtypc.
Because ofthe 'neutral' character of tim fiamc, no priority informationcan be given, so every constraint is labelled with the samedegree o1' prinrity(=l).(ex.
