SYSTEM DEMONSTRATIONINTERACTIVE GENERATION ANDKNOWLEDGE ADMINISTRATION IN MULTIMETEOJos~.

Several important problems to solve for applying Generation to the real worldWe believe that it is important from the practical point of view to use natural language generation (NLG)in real world applications.
The key benefits are outlined as follows:?
Higher quality of generated texts?
Cost effective maintenance and adaptability?
Usability?
(including acceptability by the users).Generally, it takes "exotic" (linguists, knowledge ngineers) manpower to maintain, and adapt a NLGsystem.
To avoid this problem, we have developed a Knowledge Administration ?
station, which is usableby the target population (in our project, weather forecasters).On the other hand, the system is designed to help the forecasters and not replace them.
It is able to adaptto each forecaster's style and manage nhancements?
they wish to bring to their texts.
With that in mind,the Interactive Generation environment was designed to allow forecasters to modify generated texts intheir native language, and then generate weather forecasts in several foreign languages based on thosemodifications.Interactive?
Generation is a viable alternative to Automatic Translation.2.
Mul t iMeteo2.1.
General motivationThe European weather forecast market is no longer limited to the national level.
Travelling is growingrapidly, with an increasing number of people going abroad, for both personal and professional reasons.Markets for meteorological forecasts tend to overlap borders and thus need multilingual tools.The volumes involved are high, and time constraints for producing fresh usable information are stringent:several hundreds of bulletins for each Weather Office, produced several times a day.End users have also become?
much more demanding about quality and tailoring, which here are realisedby different styles of weather forecast.1.2.
Goal and characteristics of MultiMeteoThe g0al of the MultiMeteo projectis to build an automatic multilingual short-report generation system,and to use it in the Meteorology field for producing weather forecasts from structured data I.i Other weather-forecast generation systems are FoG \[Goldberg et al 94\], Weathra \[Sigurt et al 92\], MET90 \[Sigurtet al 96\], and METEOVIS \[Kerpedjiev & Noncheva 90\]300IIIIiiilIiIThis system will allow European forecasters to automatically produce texts in English, French, German,Spanish, and Dutch.MultiMeteo is a 3-year project funded partially by the Language Engineering programme of the EuropeanCommission, and partially by European weather offices.
It involves around 40 people in France, Spain,Austria and Belgium.
There are around 15 pilot sites in Europe, which are representative of differentmeteorological characteristics (south, north, plain, mountain, sea, etc.).
In each site, 3 or 4 styles willbedeveloped (local and regional general public, seaside general public, fun-board sport oriented, etc.).3.
Interact ive Generat ion and Knowledge Admin is t rat ionThe Interactive Generation environment allows the user (the forecaster)to:?
Read the generated text?
Modify it in terms of concepts, modifiers, links, etc.?

:Once the forecaster saves the result, MultiMeteo generates the weather forecast in all the selected?
languages (which are English, Spanish and German).
Of  course his/her modifications are taken into?
account i n all of the languages.
:In addition, MultiMeteo offers a Knowledge Administration station, which allows the administrator tomodify the style of the texts to be generated, in terms o f  default structure, titles, order betweenparagraphs, available models of paragraphs, type of sentences used (telegraphic / non telegraphic), termsto be used, etc.In fact, there are two levels of administration: central and ?local.
Certain functions are specific to thecentral administration, such as the creation of a new style from scratch, or the management of themultilingual terminology.

Technica l  Character i s t i csMultiMeteo runs under PC/Windows 95 (or more), Windows NT and Unix station/Solaris2.
The input is anumerical matrix, where columns are the meteorological parameters and rows are time steps.
The outputis an HTML or RTF file that contains one or more weather forecasts.302?
i I!IThe MultiMeteo software has 4 main modules:?
The Front-End Module (FEM)?
The Administration Server?
The Generation Server?
The Help facilities.The FEM, the Administration, and the Help are written in JAVA.The Generation Server is based on ERLI's AlethGen toolbox, which has already been used for generatingtexts, in particular for producing correspondence for a leading French mail-order company (see \[Coch1996a\] and \[Coch 1996b\]).
AlethGen is divided in an engine (written in C++) and Knowledge Bases.
Theapproach is inspired by the Meaning-Text TheoryAcknowledgementsThe MultiMeteo project is partially funded by the European Commission's Language Engineeringprogramme (LE 1612), and we are very grateful to the members of the EuroPean Commission's DGXIIIfor their support of this work.References\[Coch 1996a\] Coch Jos6,1996.
