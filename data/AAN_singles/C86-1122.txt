With  regard  to  th i s  scheme the  d ia logue  func -t ions  o f  SAAs are  d i scussed .I.INTRODUCTIONWe must  s t r ive  to  prov ide  d ia logue  sys temsw i th  ab i l i ty  to  in teract  w i th  t i le  user  in  the  k indo f  cooperat ive  human- l i ke  d ia logues  o f  in fo rma-t iona l  type .
By th i s  type  o f  a d ia logue  we mean amutual informing act iv i ty  of interact ion partici-pants -- s imilar to Car\]son's (1984) dialogue game ofinformation sharing - aimed at enriching the stock gof shared (mutually coordinated) knowledge.
Ourtenet in this study is that SAAs are performed indialogues to approach the general goal of sharedknowledge.
The proposed typology of SAAs re f lectsthei r  dialogue functions and contribution i to theinformation flow process.Performing an SAA the speaker X conveys to theaddressee Z the information about some actual s i tua-tion S, i .e .
about some part  of the 'world' which atopic of the dialogue refers to.
It  is assumed herethat appropriateness of the SAA is determined byconditions formulated in terms of contextual proper-t ies  of the current communicative s i tuat ion inclu-ding knowledge, bel iefs ,  evaluations and goals ofinteract ion part ic ipants  (van Dijk, 1984).
Certaincognitive aspects of eommunicatlve s i tuat ion areconsidered to be a necessary precondition for SAAperformance and simultaneously a part of SAA integ-ral  content.To simulate the cognitive s i tuat ion and repre -sent  in fo rmat ion  const i tuents  o f  SAA content  in  apar t i c ipant ' s  ( fo r  example ,  X ' s )  knowledge base  twocogn i t ive  components  a re  de f ined .

Thentile rest  of X is X's own knowledge about the world.Now M may be defined as a set of utterances simul-taneously contained in X, Z, X:Z and Z:X ( a weakdef in i t ion of M).2.

Anothernecessary precondition is X's bel ief  that Z does notdispose of the information about S to be conveyed bythe SAA.X.
The well-known formulation " i t  is  not ob-vious to X that  Z knows that P" (Searle,1969) needsspec i f icat ion since i t  permits several in terpreta-t ions.2.2.1gnorance types.
We dist inguish fourignorance s i tuat ions defined by comparing thecurrent state of X to that of X:Z.A- ignorance .

Xbelieves also that the correct Vx-value is unknownto Z, i.e.
Vx'6Vx/Vx'=?

X:(Pi,vix),vkx>0.5*; X:Z:(Pi ,viz),viz~0.S*; X:Z:X: (P i ,v ix ' ) ,v ix '+vix/v ix '=?
X believesthat the state of Z corresponds to disjunctive un-certa inty:  there is a set {Pi} of a l ternat ive  pro-posi t ional  descript ions of S in Z3, none of themevaluated as considerably more ver is imi lar  than therest .
In X v-values of the a l ternat ives  are d i s t r i -buted in such a way that one of them (vkx) is posi-t lve.
In X's opinion, Z is ignorant of thisdistribution.D- ignorance .
x : (q ,v lx ) ,  vlx>0.5*; X: (P ,v2x) ,  V2x=l*-vlx; X:Z+Q; X:Z:(P,Vz'),Vz'>0.5*; X:Z:X:(P,Vx'),Vx'~V2x/Vx'=?
The proposit ions contained in X and(in X's opinion) present a l ternat ive  descript ionsof S.The type of ignorance determines a communica-tive goal of the SAA, this goal subordinated to thegeneral goal of the cooperative dialogue.
By SAAperformance, X intends to change Z so as to bringabout Z's beliefs of S into line with his ownknowledge, i.e.
to approximate Z to X (or, at least,Z:X to X, if S has to do with the 'mental world' ofX, i.e.
X).
This intention, in its turn, determines2.n* denotes n and the scale values close to n.3.The v-values of the a l ternat ive  proposit ions arebound by corre lat ion ~vi~l* ( < is the case whennot a l l  the a l ternat ives  are known).516a type  o f  operat iona l  change o f  Z: a)  to  inc ludein format ion  about  S in  Z (an  inc lus ion  operat ion) ;b) to exclude wrong information about S from Z (anexc lus ion  operat ion) ;  c) to  se lec t  one o f  the  a l te r -nat ive  descr ip t ions  o f  S conta ined  in  Z (a  non-e lementary  se lec t lon  operat ion  car r ied  out  by  meanso f  severa l  exc lus ions) ;  d) to  cor rect  wrong in forma-t ion  about  S conta ined  in  Z (a non-e lementarycor rect ion  operat ion  car r ied  out  by means o f  exc lu -s ion  and inc lus ion  ) .3 .
SAA TYPESThe information about the cognitive s i tuat ionis incorporated in the integral  information ( infor-mation package - IP) to be conveyed from g to Z bythe performance of an SAA.
The information const i -tuents of the SAA IP are d ist r ibuted between thethree sections representing the states  of M, X:Z andX.
Their content is formed in accordance with theignorance s i tuat ion as X sees i t  by the moment ofSAA generation.
I t  is the content of M, X:Z andthat determines a type of the given SAA.3.1 .Bas ic  SAA types .
In the  A - ignorance  s i tua -t ion  a proposit ion P and corresponding evaluativeinformation Vx is put by X under Z'sconsideration.
In the B-ignorance s i tuat ion i t  isevaluative information only that is introduced to Z.An opposition by the type of information introducedby an SAA (propositional + evaluative vs. evalua-tive) allows two basic SAA types, namely, Statements(S-SAA) and Evaluations (E-SAA), to be d is t in -guished.Statements.
S-SAA is based on the assumption thatP is not considered in Z. BV S-SAA performance, P isput under Z's consideration a d Vx-value of P iscommunicated to Z.
In general case, M is empty(with respect o S): the topic P hasn ' t  been yetin i t ia ted  in the dialogue.S-SAA IP: (a) M:O(b) X:Z+P(c) x:(P,vx)Different Vx-values determine the S-SAA sub-types: Indef inite Statements (vx=0.S*), UncertainStatements (0*<vx<0.5* and 0.5*<vx<l*) and CertainStatements (vx=0 * and vx=l*).Examples :(1) I t  seems that  John  i s  go ing  to  leave  fo r  Par i sto-morrow.
(2) I am certain that Jack has passed his exam.
(3) I don't know whether it will rain, < but I'IItake my umbrella.>(4) I don't think she is married, < so it is notfoolish for him to try to meet her again.>Evaluations.
E-SAA is performed in the communi-cative situation when P has been already activatedin M, i.e.
the topic P is under consideration in thedialogue.
No new propositional information is intro-duced by E-SAA.
The goal of X is to introduce Vx-value which is not contained in Z:X, in X's opinion.E-SAA IP: (a) M:P(b) X:Z:(P,Vz')(c) x:(P,vx)(d) X:Z:X:(P,vx'), Vx'~Vx/Vx'=?There are Positive Evaluations (Vx>0.5*), Nega-t ive Evaluatlons (vx<0.5*) and Indef inite Evalua-t ions (Vx=0,5*).
The consideration f possible oor-re lat ions of vx and vz' allows dist inguishing anumber of E-SAA subtypes that are shown In f lg .1 .
Ofspec ia l  in teres t  here  are  Acceptance  and Approva lcor respond ing  to  Vx=Vz ' .

< I 've  got  to  know h iswife.>(Strong Confirmation)b. I don't  think so, <he used to be astaunch bachelor.>(Weak Denial - Doubt)c.  I wonder!/Has he?
I d idn ' t  think so.
(Doubt, vx=0.5 *)3.2.Non-elementary SAA types.
In certa in commu-nicative s i tuat ions X performs peech acts which maybe cal led non-elementary: their  informational con-tent may be divided into several components (sets ofinformation const ituents) each representing thecontent of some elementary (basic) speech act.
Inthe s i tuat ions of C- and D-ignorance the non-elemen-tary SAAs (Correction and Selection) are performed,their  information packages being the combination ofIPs of the basic SAAs described above.Selection (pick).
P-SAA is a means of selec-tion in the C-ignorance s i tuat ion .
In the simplestcase M contains a set of two propositions (P,Q) andknowledge that only one of them is adequate to S,i .e .
M:(P/Q,I*).
By P-SAA X pos i t ive ly  evaluates Q.It  means a negative valuation of P, in accordancewith the implication ((Q,vl) - ->  (P,v2), vl=l*-v2).so, the P.-SAA IP is a combination of two E-SAA IPs,one of them introducing the posit ive evaluation of Qand the other negatively evaluating P; a constituent(b) is added to the P-SAA IP and w-values arespecif ied.P-SAA IP: (a) M:(P,Q)(b) M:(P/Q,I*)(e) X:Z:(P,o.5*)(d)  X :z : (q ,o .5* )(e)  X:(Q,vlx), vlx>0.5*(f) X: (P ,v2x) ,  V2x=l*-vlx(g) X:Z:X:(Q,VIx'), vlx'4vlx/vlx'=?
(h) X:Z:X:(P,v2x'), V2x'=l*-vlx'/V2x'=?For example:(7) Z: Has Smith gone away on business or stayedin London?X: I{e has stayed, < I saw him yesterday.>Correct ion .
C-SAA i s  per fo rmed to  cor rect  Z inthe s i tuat ion of D-ignorance.
M contains P which ischaracterized by a posit ive v-evaluatlon in Z.Assuming that P is inadequate to S, X evaluates Pnegatively and introduces Q, P and Q being a l terna-t ive, in X's oplnion, i .e .
X:(P/Q,I*).
X believesthat this  presupposition will  be accepted or ap-proved of by Z (included in Z) and thus become anelement of M. The C-SAA IP combines the E-SAA IP(Negative Evaluation in the Denial mode) and the S-SAA IP (w i th  pos i t ive  eva luat ion  o f  Q be ing  in t ro -duced) ;  a const i tuent  (d)  i s  added to  the  C-SAA IPand v -va lues  are  spec i f ied .C-SAA IP:  (a )  M:P(b)  X :Z : (P ,Vz ' ) ,  Vz '>0.5*(c) X:Z+Q(d)  X : (P /Q , I * )(e) x : (q ,v lx ) ,  vlx>0.5*(f) X: (P ,v2x) ,  v2x=l* -v lx(g) X@:X:(P,vx'), vx'~v2x/vx'=?For  example :(8) Z: You s tayed  at: home yesterday ,  I be l ieve?The nomenclature of  non-e lementary  SAAs may beexpanded bF inc lus ion  o f  a l te rnat ive  s ta tements(combination of S-SAAs), select ive statements with anon-siugle choice (combination of E-SAAs) etc.4.INFORMATION FLOW AND SAA CONTRIBUTIONIn th is  section we consider the process ofinformation flow in the cooperative informationaldialogue anti discuss the role of the basic SAAs inthis process.
The prohlem of information flow ispar t ia l l y  analyzed by Carlson (1984) who makes uc-cessful use of the table and private l i s t s  metaphor.However, the information flow scheme proposed hereseems to be more general as far as i t  takes intoaccount not only the proposit ional but also theevaluative const ituents of the par t i c ipants '  know-ledge.
This allows dist inguishing a stage of mutualcoordination of evaluations in the scheme.
Figure 2shows several var iants of the dialogue flow of whichcerta in stages are represented by Statements andEvaluations.At the  beg inn ing  o f  the  d ia logue  the  set  M i sempty  ( in l ) .
The cogn i t ive  s ta te  o f  X cor responds  toA - Ignorance .
Th is  determines  the  appropr ia teness  o fS-SAA and fo rmat ion  o f  the  communicat ive  goa l  o fthe cooperative partner X, namely, to  inform Z aboutS.
X performs an S-SAA by means of which informationabout the current cognitive s i tuat ion is conveyedfrom the speaker X to his addressee Z.
As a resu l tof S-SAA performance the cognitive s i tuat ion changesin the following way: P is entered in g:X and,consequently, in Z (by rule (2)) and in X:Z; then Pis entered in M (by (6)) and is contained there as atopic of tile dialogue ( further the question of Pwil l  not be closed unt i l l  i t s  v-evaluatlon wil l  becoordinated by the par t ic ipants ) ;  X:(P,vx) is en-tered in Z and X:Z; so, in accordance with (5) and(7), X's assumptions about S become mutually knownto the par t ie lpants ,  i .e .
M:X:(P,Vx).The fur ther  course  o f  the  d ia logue  i s  deter -mined by the  s ta te  o f  Z and  by a type  o f  in fo rma-t iona l  cont ract  between X and  Z (see  the  not ion  o f  acont ract  in  Nar in 'yan i -S imonova ,  1985) .
Th is  not ionregards  in fo rmat iona l  re la t ions  wh ich  ho ld  between Xand Z, e .g .
a dominancy  o f  X over  Z, a subord inacyo f  X to  Z or  a neut ra l i ty  between X and Z. Thesere la t ions  determine  a degree  o f  Z ' s  conf idence  in  Xand a degree  o f  Z ' s  se l f - conf ldence .Let  us  cons ider  severa l  var iants  o f  the  fu r therprogress  o f  the  d ia logue .
By var iant  1, p rov idedthat  an  index  o f  Z ' s  conf idence  i s  h igh  enough,  a v -eva luat ion  o f  P i s  fo rmed in  Z on the  bas is  o f  Vx.517By var iant  2, the fo rmat ion  of vz does not dependupon vx.
In any case ,  the  s ta tes  of Z (by ru le  (4 ) ' )and of Z:X (by ru le  (3) ,  In the B - ignorance  mode)change resu l t ing  in  the  precond i t ions  for  E-SAA.Z.The E-SAA.Z i s  immediate ly  aimed at  the a l te ra t ionof X:Z.
By the per formance of E-SAA, Z exp l i ca testhe s ta te  of Z inc lud ing  Vz, a f te r  that  X :Z :{P ,vz ) ,and the content  of M changes cor respond ing ly ,  i .e .~:z:(P,vz) .The subtype of E-SAA.Z i s  determined by Vx andVz cor re la t ion .
In case of Vx=Vz=V the subtype i sAcceptance (var iant  1: Z accepts  X's v iewpo int  on S)or Approval  (var iant  2: hav ing  the same assumpt ionsabout S, Z approves of X's v iewpo int ) .
The co inc i -dence of X 's  and Z 's  v iewpo ints  i s  now f ixed  in M;th i s  invo lves  the  cor respond ing  change of M (by ru le(7}}: the  top ic  P i s  c losed  and the const i tuent(P,v)  i s  entered  In M. So the in teract ion  i s  suc-cess fu l l y  completed (cur l}  by ach iev ing  the genera lgoa l  of the cooperat ive  d ia logue:  the s tock  ofshared  knowledge i s  enr i ched  by new mutua l ly  coord i -nated in fo rmat ion  about the wor ld.In case of Vx+Vz the subtype of E-SAA.Z i sConf i rmat ion  or Den ia l .
I t  i s  obv ious that  St rongEva luat ions  are  aimed at  changing the vx -va lue  in X.As for  Weak Eva luat ions  which express  Z 's  doubts ,the i r  goa l  i s  determined by a degree of Z ' s  se l f -con f idence :  i f  th i s  index i s  re la t ive ly  low, i t  i son ly  X:Z that  Z pretends  to change; bes ides ,  he,p robab ly ,  makes an ind i rec t  request  for  an add i t io -na l  in fo rmat ion  which shou ld  a l low him to change Vzfor  a more cer ta in  va lue .After Confirmation or Denial a stage of coordi-nating evaluations begins.
On recieving E-SAA.Z, Xmay change Vx-value thus creating preconditions forthe next in turn E-SAA.X.
In this case ~3includes the E-SAA.X and the corresponding cognitivebackground.
Provided that Z informationally domi-nates over X, a new vx-value is equal to Vz - so,the goal of the dialogue is accomplished (curl}.
Ifnobody changes his v-value after one exchange ofevaluative information (i.e.
after the sequence ofS-SAA.X and E-SAA.Z), ~3 is an argumentativeinteraction in the course of which one or both theparticipants try to prove their viewpoints by intro-ducing an additional supporting information (thereare complex speech acts in ~3) .
The non-argumenta-tive insisting is not peculiar to the cooperativedialogue, it would mean going out into a kind of aconflict (nut 2).
The above variants of the dialogueflow demonstrate significant distinctions betweenStatements and Evaluations as to their dialoguefunctions.
The S-SAA is usually an initial dialoguemove opening a topic of the dialogue.
A secondary S-SAA function is to be an answer to a certain kind ofquestions ( What's happened?
What's known aboutJohn?).
Thls option is presented in the scheme bythe dialogue beginning variant A1  which includes aquestion of Z.The E-SAA is a response by Its very nature.
Itreacts not only to the explicit assertive moves inthe dialogue but also to the implicit assertions,e .g .
to semantic presuppositions of the previousspeech acts.
In this case the E-SAA.Z follows ~2including some SA.X, e.g.
a yes/no qnestlon of Xwhich expresses just the lack of evaluative informa-tion (vx=0.5*).
The E-SAA.Z may also be performed inthe context of the precedlng SA.Z which has intro-duced P as a non-asserted propositional constituent518of an imbedding propos i t ion  {You were in teres ted  inJohn 's  a r r iva l  (SA.Z).
John ar r ived  (E-SAA.Z).)
.The resu l t  of SA.Z in A2  i s  a cogn i t ive  s ta teinc lud ing  Z :X : (P ,Vx ' ) ,Vx '=0.5*  s ince  X's v iewpo inton S i s  not exp l i c i t  in the d ia logue  (not con-ta ined  in M) but i s  merely assumed by Z.The scheme of in fo rmat ion  f low d iscussed  inth i s  sec t ion  accounts  for  funct ions  of the bas icSAAs in the cooperat ive  d ia logue .
I t  appears  to bed i rec t ly  extend ib le  for  the ana lys i s  of funct ionsof the non-e lementary  SAAs.5.CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCHIn th i s  paper we have presented  a new theore -t i ca l  approach to a formal descr ip t ion  of SAA func-t ions  in  the cooperat ive  in fo rmat iona l  d ia logue .
I td i f fe rs  from the prev ious  approaches in  severa lways:- two cognitive components in a participant's know-ledge base are defined to represent his own know-ledge as contrasted to his beliefs about his part-ner's state of knowledge; the rules are introduceddescribing the information flow relationsbetween these components;- propositional and evaluative constituents aredistinguished ill individual knowledge representa-tion; u notion of v-eva/nation is introduced andtypes of cognitive states described;- a cognitive background for SAA performance isrepresented by one of four types of ignorance;- a typology of SAAs is proposed which distinguishesbetween basic and non-elementary SAAs; for each SAAtype a formal representation of its informa-tional content is given;- a scheme of information flow Js presented whichshows different dialogue functions of SAAs; in thisscheme a stage of introducing propositional andevaluative information and that of coordinatingevaluations are considered.The limitations of the paper did not allow usto present a description of the so called particu-lar SAAs which are opposed to the general SAAsdescribed here by the scope and character of thepropositional information under evaluation.The current description can be extended in avariety of ways: an additional research i s  requiredto define the non-elementary SAAs as a sub-class ofcomplex speech acts; the dialogue scheme is also tohe extended to include the non-elementary SAAs; thequestion of how to design a dialogue model allowingfor types of informational contracts between theparticipants deserves further attention.REFERENCESCarlson L .
