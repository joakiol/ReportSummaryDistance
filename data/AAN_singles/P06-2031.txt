Owing to the robustness ofEM iterations in improving translationlikelihoods, our word sense translationaccuracies are very high, at 82% on av-erage, for the 11 most ambiguous wordsin the English FrameNet with 5 sensesor more.
We also carried out a pilotstudy on using this automatically gener-ated bilingual word sense dictionary tochoose the best translation candidatesand show the first significant evidencethat frame semantics are useful fortranslation disambiguation.
Translationdisambiguation accuracy using framesemantics is 75%, compared to 15% byusing dictionary glossing only.
Theseresults demonstrate the great potentialfor future application of bilingual framesemantics to machine translation tasks.1 IntroductionAs early as in the 1950s, semantic nets were in-vented as an ?interlingua?
for machine transla-tion.The ?semantic net?
or ?semantic map?
thathumans possess in the cognitive process is astructure of concept classes and lexicon (Illes andFrancis 1999).
In addition, the frame-semanticrepresentation of predicate-argument relationshas gained much attention in the research com-munity.
The Berkeley FrameNet (Baker et al1998) is such an example.We suggest that in addition to dictionaries, bi-lingual frame semantics (word sense dictionary)is a useful resource for lexical selection in thetranslation process of a statistical machine trans-lation system.
Manual inspection of the contras-tive error analysis data from a state-of-the-artSMT system showed that around 20% of the er-ror sentences produced could have been avoidedif the correct predicate argument information wasused (Och et al 2003).
Therefore, frame seman-tics can provide another layer of translation dis-ambiguation in these systems.We therefore propose to generate a bilingualframe semantics mapping (word sense diction-ary), simulating the ?semantic map?
in a bilin-gual speaker.
Other questions of interest to usinclude how concept classes in English and Chi-nese break down and map to each other.This paper is organized as follows.
In section2, we present the one-frame-two-languages ideaof bilingual frame semantics representation.
Insection 3, we explain the EM algorithm for gen-erating a bilingual ontology fully automatically.In section 4, we present an evaluation on wordsense translation.
Section 5 describes an evalua-tion on how well  bilingual frame semantics canimprove translation disambiguation.
We thendiscuss related work in section 6, conclude insection 7, and finally discuss future work in sec-tion 8.2 One Frame Two LanguagesThe challenge of translation disambiguation is toselect the target word cl* with the correct seman-tic frame f--(cl,f), among the multitude of transla-tion candidates Pr(cl|el).
We suggest that while asource word in the input sentence might havemultiple translation candidates, the correct targetword must have the same sense, i.e., belong tothe same semantic frame, as the source word (i.e.Pr(cl,f|el,f) is high).
For example, ?burn| ?239(tang)?
carries the ?cause_harm|damage?sense, whereas ?burn|?
(shao)?
carries the?heat|cooking?
sense.
The source sentence ?Myhands are burned?
has the?cause_harm|damage?
sense, therefore the cor-rect translation of ?burn?
is ??(tang)?
not??(shao)?.
The frame semantics informationof the source word can thus lead to the best trans-lation candidate.Whereas some translation ambiguities arepreserved over languages, most are not.
In par-ticular, for languages as different as English andChinese, there is little overlap between how lexi-con is broken-down (Ploux and Ji 2003).
Somecognitive scientists suggest that a bilingualspeaker tends to group concepts in a single se-mantic map and simply attach different words inEnglish and Chinese to the categories in thismap.Based on the above, we propose the one-frame-two-languages idea for constructing a bi-lingual word sense dictionary from monolingualontologies.FrameNet (Baker et al 1998) is a collection oflexical entries grouped by frame semantics.
Eachlexical entry represents an individual word sense,and is associated with semantic roles and someannotated sentences.
Lexical entries with thesame semantic roles are grouped into a ?frame?and the semantic roles are called ?frame ele-ments?.
Each frame in FrameNet is a conceptclass and a single word sense belongs to only oneframe.
However, the Chinese HowNet representsa hierarchical view of lexical semantics in Chi-nese.HowNet (Dong and Dong 2000) is a Chineseontology with a graph structure of word sensescalled ?concepts?, and each concept contains 7fields including lexical entries in Chinese, Eng-lish gloss, POS tags for the word in Chinese andEnglish, and a definition of the concept includingits category and semantic relations (Dong andDong, 2000).
Whereas HowNet concepts corre-spond roughly to FrameNet lexical entries, itssemantic relations do not correspond directly toFrameNet semantic roles.A bilingual frame, as shown in Figure 1,simulates the semantic system of a bilingualspeaker by having lexical items in two languagesattached to the frame.3 Automatic Generation of BilingualFrame SemanticsTo choose ?burn|?(tang)?
instead of ?burn|?
(shao)?in the translation of ?My hands areburned?, we need to know that  ??
(tang)?belongs to the ?cause_harm?
frame, but ??(shao)?
belongs to the ?heat?
frame.
In otherwords, we need to have a bilingual frame seman-tics ontology.
Much like a dictionary, this bilin-gual ontology forms part of the translation?lexicon?, and can be used either by humantranslators or automatic translation systems.Such a bilingual frame semantics ontologyalso provides a simulation of the ?concept lexi-con" of a bilingual person, as suggested by cog-nitive scientists.Figure 1 shows an example of a bilingualframe that possibly corresponds to the semanticstructure in a bilingual person.Figure 1.
An example bilingual frameWe previously proposed using the ChineseHowNet and a bilingual lexicon to map the Eng-lish FrameNet into a bilingual BiFrameNet (Fungand Chen 2004).
We used a combination offrame size thresholding and taxonomy distanceto obtain the final alignment between FrameNetframes and HowNet categories, to generate theBiFrameNet.Our previous algorithm had the disadvantageof requiring the ad hoc tuning of thresholds.
Thisresults in poor performance on lexical entriesfrom small frames (i.e.
frames with very fewlexical entries).
The tuning process also meansthat a development set of annotated data isneeded.
In this paper, we propose a fully auto-matic estimation-maximization algorithm in-stead, to generate a similar FrameNet to HowNet240bilingual ontology, without requiring any anno-tated data or manual tuning.
As such, our methodcan be applied to ontologies of any structure, andis not restricted to FrameNet or HowNet.Our approach is based on the following as-sumptions:1.
A source semantic frame is mapped to a tar-get semantic frame if many word senses inthe two frames translate to each other;2.
A source word sense translates into a targetword sense if their parent frames map to eachother.The semantic frame in FrameNet is definedas a single frame, whereas in HowNet it is de-fined as the category.
The formulae of our pro-posed algorithm are listed in Figure 2.Variable definitions:cl : Chinese lexeme .cf : Chinese frame.
(cl, cf) : the word sense entry in cf .el : English lexeme .ef : English frame.
(el, ef) : the word sense entry in ef .

The bilingual frame semantics formulaeIn the initialization step of our EM algorithm, allEnglish words in FrameNet are glossed into Chi-nese using a bilingual lexicon with uniformprobabilities Pr(cl|el).
Next, we apply the EMalgorithm to align FrameNet frames and HowNetcategories.
By using EM, we improve the prob-abilities of frame mapping in Pr(cf|ef) and wordsense translations in Pr(cl,cf|el,ef) iteratively: Weestimate sense translations based on uniform bi-lingual dictionary probabilities Pr(cl|el) first.The frame mappings are maximized by using theestimated sense translation.
The a priori lexicalprobability Pr(cl) is assumed to be one for allChinese words.
Underlining the correctness ofour algorithm, we note that the overall likeli-hoods of the model parameters in our algorithmimprove until convergence after 11 iterations.We use the alignment output after the conver-gence step.
That is, we obtain all word sensetranslations and frame mapping from the EMalgorithm:( )efefcfcfefelefelcfclcfclcfcfcl?=?=)|Pr(maxarg*),(   ,|,Prmaxarg)*,(),(The mapping between FrameNet frames andHowNet categories is obviously not one-to-onesince the two languages are different.
The initialand final mappings before and after EM itera-tions are shown in Figures 3a,b and 4a,b.
Eachpoint (i,j) in Figures 3a and b represents analignment between FrameNet frame i to HowNetcategory j.
Before EM iterations, each Englishlexical item is glossed into its (multiple) Chinesetranslations by a bilingual dictionary.
The parentframe of the English lexical item and those of allits Chinese translations are aligned to form aninitial mapping.
This initial mapping shows thateach English FrameNet frame is aligned to anaverage of 56 Chinese HowNet categories.
Thismapping is clearly noisy.
After EM iterations,each English frame is aligned to 5 Chinese cate-gories on average, and each Chinese category isaligned to 1.58 English frames on average.241Figure 3a.
FrameNet to HowNet mapping before EMiterations.Figure 3b.
FrameNet to HowNet mapping after EMiterations.We also plot the histograms of one-to-Xmapping between FrameNet frames and HowNetcategories before and after EM iterations in Fig-ure 4.
The horizontal axis is the number X inone-to-X mapping between English and Chineseframes.
The vertical axis is the occurrence fre-quency.
For example, point (i,j) represents thatthere are j frames in English mapping to i catego-ries in Chinese.
Figure 4 shows that using lexicalglossing only, there are a large number of framesthat are aligned to over 150 of Chinese catego-ries, while only a small number of Englishframes align to relatively few Chinese categories.After EM iterations, the majority of the Englishframes align to only a few Chinese categories,significantly improving the frame mappingacross the two languages.Figure 4a.

?.4 Robust Word Sense Translation UsingFrame SemanticsWe evaluate the accuracy of word sense transla-tion in our automatically generated bilingual on-tology,  by testing on the most ambiguous lexicalentries in FrameNet, i.e.
words with the highestnumber of frames.
These words and some oftheir sense translations are shown in Table 1 be-low.tie.n,clothing -> ?.n,part|?
?tie.v,cause_confinement -> ??.v,restrain|?
?tie.v,cognitive_connection -> ??.v,connect|?
?make.n,type -> ??.n,attribute|?
?make.v,building -> ??.v,build|?
?make.v,causation -> ?.v,CauseToDo|?

?feel.n,sensation -> ??.n,experience|?
?feel.v,perception_active -> ??.v,perception|?
?feel.v,seeking -> ?.v,LookFor|?Table 1.
Example word sense translation out-putThe word sense translation accuracies of theabove words are shown in Table 2.
The resultsare highly positive given that those from previ-ous work in word translation disambiguation us-ing bootstrapping methods (Li and Li, 2003;Yarowsky 1995) achieved 80-90% accuracy indisambiguating between only two senses perword1.The only susceptibility of our algorithm is inits reliance on bilingual dictionaries.
The sensetranslations of the words ?tie?, ?roll?, and ?look?are relatively less accurate due to the absence ofcertain translations in the dictionaries we used.For example, the ?bread/food?
sense of the word?roll?
is not found in the bilingual dictionaries atall.EnglishwordNumber offrames/sensesin FrameNetSensetranslationaccuracytie 8 64%make 7 100%roll 6 55%feel 6 88%can 5 81%run 5 100%shower 5 100%burn 5 91%pack 5 85%drop 5 76%look 5 64%Average 5.6 82%Table 2.
Translation accuracies of the most am-biguous words in FrameNetWe compare our results to that of our previ-ous work (Fung and Chen 2004), by using thesame bilingual lexicon.
Table 3 shows that wehave improved the accuracy of word sense trans-lation using the current method.lexicalentryParent frame Accuracy(Fung &Chen2004)Accuracy(this pa-per)beat.v cause_harm 88.9% 100%move.v motion 100% 100%bright.a light_emission 79.1% 100%hold.v containing 22.4% 100%fall.v mo-tion_directional87% 100%issue.v emanating 31.1% 100%Table 3.
Our method improves word sensetranslation precision over Fung and Chen (2004).We note in particular that whereas the previ-ous algorithm in Fung and Chen (2004) does not1 We are not able to evaluate our algorithm on the sameset of words as in (Li & Li 2003; Yarowsky 1995) sincethese words do not have entries in FrameNet.243perform well on lexical entries from small frames(e.g.
on ?hold.v?
and ?issue.v?)
due to ad hocmanual thresholding, the current method is fullyautomatic and therefore more robust.
In Fungand Chen (2004), semantic frames are mapped toeach other if their lexical entries translate to eachother above a certain threshold.
If the frames aresmall and therefore do not contain many lexicalentries, then these frames might not be correctlymapped.
If the parent concept classes are not cor-rectly mapped, then word sense translation accu-racy suffers.The main advantage of our algorithm over ourwork in 2004 lies in the hill-climbing iterationsof the EM algorithm.
In the proposed algorithm,all concept classes are mapped with a certainprobability, so no mapping is filtered out prema-turely.
As the algorithm iterates, it is more prob-able for the correct bilingual word sense to betranslated to each other, and it is also more prob-able for the bilingual concept classes to bemapped to each other.
After convergence of thealgorithm, the output probabilities are optimaland the translation results are more accurate.5 Towards Translation Disambiguationusing Frame SemanticsAs translation disambiguation forms the core ofvarious machine translation strategies, we areinterested in studying whether the generated bi-lingual frame semantics can complement existingresources, such as bilingual dictionaries, fortranslation disambiguation.The semantic frame of the predicate verb andthe argument structures in a sentence can beidentified by the syntactic structure, part-of-speech tags, head word, and other features in thesentence.
The predicate verb translation corre-sponds to the word sense translation we de-scribed in the previous sections, Pr(cl,cf | el,ef).We intend to evaluate the effectiveness of bi-lingual frame semantics mapping in disambiguat-ing between translation candidates.
For theevaluation set, we use 202 randomly selectedexample sentences from FrameNet, which havebeen annotated with predicate-argument struc-tures.In the first step of the experiment, for eachpredicate word (el,ef), we find all its translationcandidates of the predicate word in each sen-tence, and annotate them with their HowNetcategories to form a translated word sensePr(cl,cf|el,ef).
For the example sentence in Fig-ure 6, there are altogether 147 word sense trans-lations for (hold,detaining).Under South African law police could HOLD the manfor questioning for up to 48 hours before seeking thepermission of magistrates for an extension##HOLD,detaining# ??,engage|?

Other than the English FrameNet(Baker et al 1998), we also note the constructionof the Spanish FrameNet (Subirats & Petruck,2003), the Japanese FrameNet (Ikeda 1998), andthe German FrameNet (Boas, 2002).
In terms oflearning method, Chen and Palmer (2004) alsoused EM learning to cluster Chinese verb senses.Word Sense TranslationPrevious word sense translation methods arebased on using context information to improvetranslation.
These methods look at the contextwords and discourse surrounding the sourceword and use methods ranging from  boostrap-ping (Li & Li 2003), EM iterations (Cao and Li,2002; Koehn and Knight 2000),  and the cohe-sive relation between the source sentence andtranslation candidates (Fung et al 1999; Kikui1999).Our proposed translation disambiguationmethod compares favorably to (Li & Li 2003) inthat we obtain an average of 82% precision onwords with multiple senses, whereas they ob-tained precisions of 80-90% on words with twosenses.
Our results also compare favorably to(Fung et al 1999; Kikui 1999) as the precision ofour predicate verb in the input sentence transla-tion disambiguation is about 75% whereas theirprecisions range from 40% to 80%, albeit on anindependent set of words.Automatic Generation of Frame SemanticsGreen et al (2004) induced SemFrame automati-cally and compared it favorably to the hand-constructed FrameNet (83.2% precision in cover-ing the FrameNet frames).
They map WordNetand LDOCE, two semantic resources, to obtainSemFrame.
Burchardt et al (2005) used Frame-Net in combination with WordNet to extend cov-erage.Bilingual Semantic MappingPloux and Ji, (2003) proposed a spatial model formatching semantic values between French andEnglish.
Palmer and Wu (1995) studied the map-ping of change-of-state English verbs to Chinese.Dorr et al (2002) described a technique for theconstruction of a Chinese-English verb lexiconbased on HowNet and the English LCS Verb Da-tabase (LVD).
They created links betweenHowNet concepts and LVD verb classes usingboth statistics and a manually constructed ?seedmapping?
of thematic classes between HowNetand LVD.
Ngai et al (2002) induced bilingualsemantic network from WordNet and HowNet.They used lexical neighborhood information in aword-vector based approach to create the align-ment between WordNet and HowNet classeswithout any manual annotation.7 ConclusionBased on the one-frame-two-languages idea,which stems from the hypothesis of the mind of abilingual speaker, we propose automatically gen-erating a bilingual word sense dictionary or on-tology.
The bilingual ontology is generated fromiteratively estimating and maximizing the prob-ability of a word translation given frame map-ping, and that of frame mapping given wordtranslations.
We have shown that for the mostambiguous 11 words in the English FrameNet,the average word sense translation accuracy is82%.
Applying the bilingual ontology mappingto translation disambiguation of predicate verbsin another evaluation, the accuracy of ourmethod is at an encouraging 75%, significantlybetter than the 15% accuracy of using bilingualdictionary only.
Most importantly, we have dem-onstrated that bilingual frame semantics is poten-tially useful for cross-lingual retrieval, machine-aided and machine translation.8 Future WorkOur evaluation exercise has shown the promiseof using bilingual frame semantics for translationtask.
We are currently carrying out further workin the aspects of (1) improving the accuracy ofsource word frame identification and (2) incorpo-rating bilingual frame semantics in a full fledged245machine translation system.
In addition, Frame-Net has a relatively poor coverage of lexical en-tries.
It would be necessary to apply either semi-automatic or automatic methods such as those in(Burchardt et al 2005, Green et al2004) to ex-tend FrameNet coverage for final application tomachine translation tasks.
Last but not the least,we are interested in applying our method to otherontologies such as the one used for the Propbankdata, as well as to other language pairs.AcknowledgementThis work was partially supported by CERG#HKUST6206/03E and CERG# HKUST6213/02Eof the Hong Kong Research Grants Council.
