devices address beliefs presumably entertained by thelistener which may affect the acquisition of the IM, but,unlike the beliefs addressed by Instantiations andDescriptions, are not directly instrumental to itscomprehension \[Zukerman 1990b\].
Our mechanism isbased on ideas introduced in \[Zukerrnan and Cheong1988\], and it follows the tenet that Peripheral RDs aregenerated to invalidate anticipated impairments to alistener's comprehension process.
To this effect, ourmechanism departs from the existing discourse genera-tion strategies, and adopts a predictive approach,whereby the effect of a message is simulated on a shal-low model of a listener's beliefs.
If an impairment to thecomprehension process is anticipated by this model, thegeneration of a remedial rhetorical device is called for.In the following section, we briefly consider a modelof a listener's beliefs capable of predicting commonlydrawn inferences.
We then describe our mechanism forthe generation of Peripheral RDs.Mode l  of  a L i s tener ' s  Be l ie fsIn order to address beliefs presumably entertained by aparticular listener, we maintain an epistemologicalmodel which represents a listener's beliefs as a functionof the presented material.
This function accounts bothfor direct and indirect inferences drawn from presentedmessages \[Zukerman 1990a\].We represent a listener's beliefs by means of a net-work whose nodes contain individual information itemsand whose links contain the relationships between thenodes (see Figure 2).
The information in the network isrepresented at a level of detail which is consistent withthe level of expertise required to learn the subject athand, e.g., for a high-school student learning algebra,well-known concepts, such as numerical addition andsubtraction, are primitive, whereas relatively new orcomplex concepts, such as bracket simplification, arerepresented in terms of more primitive concepts.
Thelinks in the network are labeled according to the mannerin which they were acquired, i.e., they can either beInferred, Told or previously Known, where Inferredlinks are generated by means of generally applicableCommon-sense Inference Rules.
In addition, each link isaccompanied by a Measure of Belief (MB) between -1and 1, akin to Certainty Factors \[Buchanan and Short-liffe 1985\], which represents a user's level of expertise.The nodes are labeled according to their complexity, pfor primitive concepts and e for complex ones.
Likelinks, nodes may be Inferred, Told or previouslyKnown, and each node has a Degree of Expertise (DE)between 0 and 1.
The DE of a c-node is a function ofthe DEs and MBs of its constituent nodes and links,respectively.In this paper, we focus on technical domains, wherethe transmitted information typically pertains to pro-cedures, objects and goals.
We define a context as a tri-ple composed of a procedure, an object to which it isapplied, and the goal accomplished by this procedurewhen applied to this object (labeled cl-c4 in Figure 2),to reflect the fact that one procedure may achieve dif-ferent goals when applied to different objects.
For exam-ple, factoring out a common factor will only partiallyfactorize a quadratic trinomial such as 3x2+5x-2, whileit will completely factorize a binomial such as 3x2+5x.Newly Interred Links.~"  Nodes and Links to be addedFig.
2: Network Model of a Listener's Beliefs inHigh-School Algebra 3Our inference mechanism generates plausible infer-ences from links in the network by means of generallyapplicable Common-sense Inference Rules which portrayreasoning activities uch as generalization, specializationand similarity-based inference (see Figure 3).
Theseroles are inspired by rule adaptations commonly per-formed by students which were studied by Matz (1982),Brown and Van Lehn (1980), Van Lehn (1983) andSleeman (1984).
In order to account for the deductiveabilities of a particular type of listener, we annotate achrule with a measure of uncertainty, denoted p, whichrepresents a listener's belief in the validity of a conclu-sion given that the evidence is certain.
This measureresembles the rule strength used in ACT* \[Anderson1983\].
The application of the similarity-based rule inFigure 3 to the context cl and the link \[Numbers simileAT\] in Figure 2 yields the erroneous context e3.3 In the actual network each link may have a counterpartrepresenting the inverse relationship.
However, for clarity ofpresentation, only links which are relevant o our discussionare shown here.157R2 (Similarity-based Inference); I f  two objects are identified as similar, the; applicability of a procedure to one of the objects; can be inferred from its applicability to the other,; accomplishing the same goalIF { 3 a link \[OBJm simile OBJn\] (MB = kin,)ANDB a context \[PROCa--OBJm--GOALt \]with links \[PROCo apply-to OBJm\] (MB = kam)and \[PROC= has-goal GOALt\] (MB = ktam) }THEN (with certainty P2 )Add a context \[PROCa---OBJ,--GOALt\]with links \[PROCa apply-to OBJ,\] of type I(MB = k .

3: Similarity-basedCommon-sense Inference RuleGenerating Peripheral Rhetorical DevicesThe generation of Peripheral RDs is performed byapplying a procedure called Impairment-Invalidate.
Thisprocedure simulates the effect of an IM on our networkmodel to anticipate possible impairments which mayinhibit a listener's acquisition of this IM, and then pro-poses Peripheral RDs, such as Contradictions, Revisionsand Motivations, to invalidate these impairments.
Tothis effect, it activates three mechanisms: (1) Propaga-tion of the effect of a message, (2) Recognition ofimpairments, and (3) Selection of Peripheral RDs.
In thefollowing subsections, we describe these mechanismsand then discuss procedure Impairment-Invalidate.Propagation of a MessagePropagation simulates the alterations taking effect in anetwork representing a listener's beliefs due to infer-ences drawn from a message.
These inferences, whichare drawn by activating applicable Common-sense Infer-ence Rules, result in changes in the MBs of existinglinks or addition of new links and nodes to the network.For instance, a Contradiction such as "You cannotalways simplify inside the brackets of algebraic terms,"presented to weaken a listener's belief in the applicabil-ity of bracket simplification to Algebraic Terms, maycause the listener to weaken his/her correct belief in theapplicability of bracket simplification to Like AlgebraicTerms or even to Numbers, and also to weaken his/herincorrect belief in the applicability of bracket simplifica-tion to Unlike Algebraic Terms and in the applicabilityof addition and subtraction to Algebraic Terms.
Thiseffect is simulated by the propagation of the Contradic-tion \[BrS ~apply-to AT\] in the sample network in Figure2, which produces the inferences \[Br$ -,apply-to L'I'\] and\[BrS ~apply-to UT\] through the application of aspecialization rule, \[BrS ~apply-to Numbers\] through theapplication of the similarity-based rule R2 (see Figure3), and \[+/- ~apply-to AT\] through the application of adeductive inference rule.
These inferences contradict thebeliefs represented by existing links, thereby loweringthe MBs associated with these links.
However, theireffect ultimately depends on the strength of the rules inquestion and on the MBs of the links, i.e., the impact ofan inference on a weakly believed link is more pro-nounced than for a strongly believed one.Recognition of ImpairmentsThe Recognition mechanism anticipates possible impair-merits to a listener's comprehension process by examin-ing changes in a network representing the listener'sbeliefs due to a message or an inference.
It does notguarantee that a certain impairment will occur, rather, itconjectures that an impairment is likely to affect a par-titular link, denoted a culprit link.We have characterized in terms of our network modeltwo main types of impairments which lead to undesir-able effects commonly encountered in a knowledgeacquisition setting: (1) Affect-related impairments whichelicit negative affective responses such as Confusion andLoss of Interest, and are caused by a conflict between amessage or inference and a belief held by a listener; and(2) Belief-related impairments uch as Mislearning,Insufficient Learning or Insignificant Change in alistener's knowledge status, which are caused by adiscrepancy between a listener's belief in a proposition(possibly as a result of an inference) and the belief thespeaker intends him/her to have in this proposition.
Letus first consider the Affect-related impairments.Confusion occurs when an inference decreases signifi-candy a listener's confidence in a previous belief, caus-ing a discomforting transition from a self-perception ofpossessing knowledge to one of increased uncertainty.
Interms of our network model, Confusion takes placewhen the absolute value of an Anticipated Measure ofBelief (AMB), obtained by combining the MB of a linkwith the MB of an inference regarding this link, is signi-ficantly lower than the absolute value of the originalMB of this link.
For instance, the statement "One can-not always add algebraic terms," which yields a nega-tive value for the MB of the link \[+/- apply-to AI'\] inFigure 2, may trigger the erroneous inference \[+/--apply-to LT\], which contradicts the link \[+/- apply-toLT\], thereby lowering its MB.
The Strength of thisimpairment for a link L is defined as follows:Strength (Confusion ,L ) =max/( I MB (L ) I - lAMB (L ) I ),0}Loss o/Interest occurs when a listener who is initiallymotivated to acquire knowledge is presented with an IMs/he considers redundant.
In terms of our model, thistakes place if there exists a node B which subsumes anew node A, i.e., new distinguishing links incident uponA are connected to the same nodes and have MBs ofcompatible magnitude and sign as the corresponding158links incident upon B.
For this type of impairment, aculprit link is an erroneous link incident upon Brepresenting belief, whose reversal into disbelief resultsin B no longer subsuming A.
This situation is illustratedin Figure 2, where we try to add the node DL, represent-ing distributive law, and the links \[DL apply-to AT\] and\[DL has-goal BrE\] to the network representing alistener's beliefs.
However, the existence of the culpritlink \[BrS apply-to AT\] supports the erroneous belief thatbracket simplificauon is equivalent to distributive law,thereby rendering the new procedure redundant.
If allthe existing links participating in an impainnent due toLoss of Interest are correct, no culprit link is identified.A characterization f Belief-related impairments musttake into consideration the difference between alistener's level of expertise and a level of expertise con-sidered satisfactory.
To this effect we define theStrength of an impairment I in link L as follows:( - 1 , 1 ):ii 5:i!(-I,.i)kAMB?

Its value may be obtained from a network whichrepresents the speaker's beliefs.
The relative position ofBelief-related impairments and Confusion in a listener'sbelief space is graphically represented in Figure 4 whichdepicts these impairments as a function of the AMB andthe previous MB of a link with SMB >0.
The diagramfor a link with SMB <0 is syrnmelric to the one in Fig-ure 4.Mislearning takes place when an erroneous beliefwith a relatively high degree of certainty is produced byan incorrect inference drawn by a listener.
In terms ofour network model, this takes place when the AMB of alink represents a substantial incorrect belief, and if thislink existed previously, the strength of the impairmenthas increased, i.e., the AMB of this link is farther thanits previous MB from its SMB.
If the absolute value ofthe AMB of the link in question is higher than the abso-lute value of its previous MB, the listener will falselyperceive him/herself as being more proficient.Insufficient Learning occurs when a correct inferenceyields a correct belief with a relatively high degree ofcertainty, but which still falls short of a desired degreeof certainty representative of proficiency.
In terms ofour network model, this occurs when the AMB of a linkrepresents a substantial correct belief, and ff this linkexisted previously, the strength of the impairment hasdecreased, i.e., the AMB of this link is closer than itsprevious MB to its SMB.Finally, an Insignificant Change in a listener'sknowledge status occurs when an inference accom-ptishes a rather inconsequential change with respect o apreviously non-existent link or with respect to a linkNo impairment (NI) Q Confusion (C)Q Mislearning (ML) Q Insufficient Learning (IL)Q Insignificant Change (IC)Fig.
4: Characterization of Impairments fora Link with SMB>0with an MB representative of insufficient proficiency.This MB may represent either a correct belief or anincorrect belief.The immediate invalidation of Affect-related impair-ments is essential for the smooth continuation of theknowledge acquisition process, since their persistencediverts a listener's mental resources from the task ofacquiring knowledge.
On the other hand, the invalidationof Belief-related impairments with respect o links whichare not currently in focus may be temporarily postponeddue to didactic or stylistic considerations.
Therefore,although Confusion may take place in conjunction witha Belief-related impairment, he recognition and subse-quent invalidation of Confusion takes precedence overthe detection of this impairment (see Figure 4).Selection of Rhetorical DevicesThe Selection mechanism proposes a Peripheral RD toaddress a recognized impairment.
The type of this rhe-torical device, its wording, and its position in the finalmessage sequence depend on the type of the impairment,the correctness and magnitude of the previous MB ofthe culprit link, and the SMB of this link (see Table I).The strength of an impairment affects the need for addi-tional explanations, uch as Causal explanations andInstantiations, to convey a Peripheral RD.159Table 1: Peripheral RDs as a Function ofImpair.ment Types and Link ValuesImpairmentTypeLoss ofInterestConfusionMislearnin 8InsufficientLearningInsignificantChangeLink Value Peripheral RDCorrect Motivate (add links',Incorrect Contradict linkCorrect Revise linkIncorrect Contradict linkI ..... - -  Contradict inference- -  Revise inferenceHigh MB (Correct) Revise linkHigh MB (Incorrect) Contradict link\[ Low MB (SMB >0) Revise informationLow MB (SMB <0)The Link Value column in Table 1 contains informa-tion pertaining to the previous MB and the SMB of theculprit link.
This information is unnecessary whenaddressing Mislearning and Insufficient Learning, sincethese impairments are completely characterized by theirtype.
However, for the rest of the impairments, thecorrectness of the previous MB is the main factor in thedetermination of the type of a Peripheral RD.
Loss ofInterest is invalidated by a Contradiction of a culpritlink, if such a link is identified; otherwise, a Motivationhas to generated by adding nodes and links which renderthe new information on-redundant, e.g., "You alreadyknow how to solve quadratic equations by completion tosquare.
A faster method is ... " (demil~ regarding thetypes of Motivations which are suitable for differentsituations and users appear in \[Zukerman 1987\]).
Theinvalidation of an Insignificant Change in a link with anMB representative of lack of expertise, i.e., an MBwhose absolute value is close to 0, is performed in amanner similar to the correction of complete ignorance.That is, if the SMB of this link is positive, this impair-ment is invalidated by a Revision of the relevant infor-marion, whereas ff it is negative, i.e., representative ofdisbelief, no Peripheral RD is proposed, since it may besuperfluous to induce disbelief with respect o a proposi-tion which is hardly entertained by a listener.As seen in Table 1, we distinguish between two typesof Peripheral RDs according to the source of the beliefbeing addressed, namely Peripheral RDs which addresspreviously existing links and Peripheral RDs whichaddress current inferences.
This distinction is not alwaysreflected in the English realization of a rhetorical device,rather, it may affect the Meta Comments which accom-pany it and its position in the final message sequence.For instance, the propagation of the Contradiction \[BrS~apply-to AT\] may yield the erroneous inference \[BrS--,aBly-to LT\] which in turn may cause an impairment inthe link \[BrS apply-to LT\].
If the anticipated impairmentis Confusion, it will be invalidated by a Revision of thislink, whereas if it is Mislearning, it will be invalidatedby a Contradiction of the erroneous hfference.
The mostsuccinct realization of both Peripheral RDs is thesentence "You can always simplify bracketed LikeTerms."
However, the Revision of the previous beliefmay appear either before or after the above Contradic-tion and include a Meta Comment which states thesource of this belief, e.g., "As we saw in Section 7, youcan always simplify bracketed Like Terms"; while theContradiction of the erroneous inference would usuallyappear after the above Contradiction and would beaccompanied by a Meta Comment which indicates a vio-lation of an expectation established by the inference,e.g., "Bracket simplification does not always apply toalgebraic terms, but it always applies to Like Terms.
"The Peripheral RDs proposed by our Selection mechan-ism contain sufficient information to support he genera-tion of these types of Meta Comments by means ofmechanisms such as the ones presented in \[Zukermanand Pearl 1986\] and \[Zukerman 1989\].Procedure  Impa i rment - Inva l idateImpairment-Invalidate is activated with one argumentwhich contains an IM.
It returns a Message-List com-posed of the IM and the Peripheral RDs which wereproposed to invalidate the impairments anticipated as aresult of this message.Procedure Impairment-Invalidate(Message)I Message-List ~- Message2 Peripheral-RDsJnferences ~- nil3 Firstlmp ~- (Message ,TM ,SM ,LM),where (TM ,SM ,LM) ~ Recognize(Message)4 If Firsdmp ThenMessage-ListAppend (Message-List ,Select (Firstlmp ))5 For each m E Message-List do6 Inferences ~- Merge (Inferences ,Propagate (m))7 endfor8 Impairments ~ {(i,Ti,Si,Li) I(i Elnferences) ^( (Ti ,Si ,Li )~-Recognize (i ))}9 While Impairments do10 Maxlmp ~ (I,T/,St,L/),where {(I ,Tt ,St fit )~ Impairments ^Ranking (I ,Tt ,st ,Lt ) =max {Ranking(j,Ts,sj,Li)}} q ,Tj ~ l~ j)e t, nt,ar~,at11 Impairments ~ Impairments -- Maxlmp12 RDM=t,~, ~- Select (Maxlmp )13 Peripheral-RDsAppend (Peripheral-RDs ,RDMaa,,~, )14 Secondary-Inferences ~--Propagate (RD~=a,~,)15 Secondary-Effects ~ Secondary-lnferences ~{j I (j ,T j ,S j ,Lj )~ Impairments}16 Impairments ~-- {Impairments -{(i ,Ti ,si ,Li ) l i E Secondary-Effects }}k. ){(i ,Ti ,si ,Li ) I(i ~ Secondary-Inferences) ^( (Ti ,Si fii )+--Recognize ( i ) )}17 endwhile18 Message-ListAppend (Message-List ,Peripheral-RDs )160Table 2: Inferences and Possible Impairments after PropagationMessageIM \[DL apply-toAT has-goal BrE\]Contradiction\[BrS -~apply-to AT\]of the 1M andRuleSimilaritySpecializationI SpecialiT~fionSimilaritySpecializationSpecializationDeductionthe Contradiction in the Sample NetworkInference \[ Possible Impairment\[DL apply-to Numbers has-goal BrE\]\]\[DL apply-to LT has-goal BrE\] ~ Insufficient Learning\[DL apply-to UT has-goal BrE\] J\[BrS -~apply-to Numbers\]\[BrS -~apply-to LT\]\[BrS -~apply-to UT\]\[+/- -~apply-to AT\]\] ConfusionlMislearninglJ Insignificant Change\] Confusion/Inst.
Learning/J Insignificant ChangeWe distinguish between two main stages of this pro-cedure: (1) The preliminary stage (lines 1-4) whichdetermines the need for a Peripheral RD related to theinput message, and (2) The iterative stage (lines 5-17)which ascertains the need for Peripheral RDs pertainingto subsequent inferences.In the preliminary stage, procedure Recognize isapplied in order to determine whether the IM is likely tocause an impairment.
If this is the case, Recognitionreturns a triple (T,S,L), where T contains the Type ofthe impairment, S its Strength, and L indicates whetherthe belief represented by the link in question is corrector incorrect.
Otherwise, it returns n/l and no impairmentis predicted.
If an impairment was anticipated, procedureSelect is activated to propose a Peripheral RD.
In ourexample, the Selection mechanism invalidates theimpairment responsible for the Loss of Interest bymeans of the Contradiction \[BrS -,apply-to AT\] whichinduces disbelief in the link \[BrS apply-to AT\].
Uponcompletion of the preliminary stage, the proposed Peri-pheral RD together with the IM form the Message-List,which constitutes the input to the next phase of theimpairment invalidation procedure.Both the IM and the proposed Peripheral RD causemodifications in a listener's degree of belief in theaddressed links.
These modifications in turn may lead tochanges in his/her beliefs in other links.
Hence, in orderto prevent impairments due to inferences drawn fromthese messages, additional Peripheral RDs may be calledfor.
Furthermore, Peripheral RDs may be required inorder to invalidate an Insignificant Change in linksrelated to the IM which have MBs representative ofinsufficient proficiency, i.e., to attain a satisfactorydegree of expertise with respect to these links.
To deter-mine the need for additional Peripheral RDs, Propagateproduces inferences from each message in Message-List.During this process, inferences from different messageswhich affect he same link are merged into one inferencewith a combined effect (lines 5-7).
Recognition thenascertains the attributes of the impairments which arelikely to be caused by these inferences (line 8).
Forinstance, the Propagation of the input message \[DLapply-to AT has-goal BrE\] and the Contradiction \[BrS-,apply-to AT\] in the sample network in Figure 2 mayyield the inferences in Table 2.
In principle, each ofthese inferences may be responsible for an impairment.However, as stated above, the effect of these inferencesultimately depends on the p-s of the rules applied in thepropagation process and on the MBs of the affectedlinks.
In our present discussion, we assume that Confu-sion was recognized in the links \[BrS apply-to LT\] and\[BrS apply-to Numbers\].Based on Gricean maxims of cooperative conversation(Grice 1975), we propose to generate a minimal numberof rhetorical devices to invalidate impairments occurringconcurrently in a number of links.
To this end, weiterate over the set of impairments, selecting at eachstage the culprit link with the highest ranking impair-ment (line 10).
The impairments are ranked according totheir type and strength, where impairments causing Con-fusion are ranked higher than Belief-related impairments.A Peripheral RD is then proposed to invalidate theimpairment in the selected link, and its effect is pro-pagated (lines 12-14).
Once a Peripheral RD has beengenerated to address a particular link, further inferencesdrawn during the same activation of Impairment-Invalidate no longer affect this link.
For each iterauon,the set of impairments is updated by merging the infer-enccs responsible for the previously recognized impair-ments with the inferences resulting from the most recentpropagation, and reapplying the Recognition process0ines 15-16).
In this manner, a low-ranking impairmentin a given link may be spontaneously invalidated by aninference resulting from a Peripheral RD generated toinvalidate an impairment in another link.
For example,ff the impairment in the link \[BrS apply-to Numbers\]ranks higher than the impairment in the link \[BrS apply-to LT\], a Revision is generated to invalidate the impair-ment in the former link.
The propagation of this Revi-sion may invalidate the Confusion with respect o thelatter link.
If this Revision does not cause furtherimpairments, the procedure terminates returning the fol-lowing messages:IM \[DL apply4o AT has-goal BrE\]Contradiction \[BrS -~apply-to AT\]Revision \[BrS apply-to Numbers has-goal BrE\]The generation of belief Revisions tends to inhibitfurther impairments, since they reinforce beliefs whichare likely to be consistent with the rest of a listener'sbeliefs, while the generation of belief Contradictionstends to foster impairments, since they disagree with161existing beliefs.
However, in a knowledge acquisitionsetting, misconceptions are generally not allowed to pileup, hence Contradictions to existing beliefs are expectedonly during the initial stages of the propagation process.Therefore, although in principle our algorithm mayiterate indefinitely, in practice, impairments hould nolonger be detected after a few iteraations, and the processshould halt after proposing a few Peripheral RDs.
Thisexpectation is confirmed by tests run with our samplenetwork (see next section).
However, this network israther small, and there may be situations in which thenumber of Peripheral RDs proposed by our mechanismwill have to be restricted ue to stylistic or pedagogicalconsiderations.
In such cases, our mechanism will haveto be adjusted to invalidate only a subset of the recog-nized impairments uch as the highest ranking impair-ments or impairments in links which are closest o theIM.EvaluationProcedure Impairment-Invalidate has been implementedin a system called WISHFUL, which was run on severalinstances of the network in Figure 2.
These instancesfeatured MBs which represented three types of students:(1) Competent - - with high MBs associated with correctbeliefs, (2) Average-  containing some incorrect beliefsand medium-range MBs associated with correct beliefs,and (3) Mediocre - -  with very low MBs associated withmost beliefs.
The initial values assigned to the MBs ofthe finks and the p-s of the Common-sense InferenceRules yielded Peripheral RDs which were compatiblewith rhetorical devices people would generate undersimilar circumstances, and the response time was instan-taneous for these rather small networks.
As expected,changes in the p-s of the Common-sense InferenceRules resulted in variations in the generated RDs, withadditional Contradictions due to Misleaming being gen-erated as the p-s of unsound rules increased, and addi-tional Revisions due to Insufficient Learning as the p-sof sound rules decreased.
In addition, the number andstrength of the recognized impairments increased as theability of the students being represented in a networkdecreased, iadicating that additional explanations wouldbe required to convey a message to the poorer students.In particular, for the networks representing competentstudents, either Revisions of inferences due to Insuffi-cient Learning or no Peripheral RDs were proposed(depending on the p-s of the Common-sense InferenceRules); for the networks representing average students,Contradictions and Revisions were proposed in a mannersimilar to the explanations in this paper, and for the net-works representing mediocre students most of the pro-posed Peripheral RDs were Revisions of information.Our mechanism has also proven successful as ananalytical tool.
It accounts for the presence of PeripheralRDs in over twenty texts in a variety of domains, rang-ing from expert domains (Telecommunications, Cogni-tive Science and Linguistics) through intermediate ones(high-school Algebra, Data Structures, Lisp and intro-ductory Chess) to novice domains (Childcraft Encyclo-pedia and Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care).L imi tat ions  and Future ResearchOur mechanism proposes rhetorical devices under theassumption that after it has done "its best," thelistener's beliefs addressed by the discourse will bemodified in the desired direction, although not neces-sarily to the desired extent.
This is a valid assumptionfor discourse generation, since one can not say morethan one knows.
However, for this mechanism to gen-erate effective discourse on a continued basis, the modelof the fistener's beliefs must be updated by an indepen-dent assessment of the his/her understanding.In addition, our mechanism ust be implemented ondifferent domains and larger networks to test both itsresponse time and the adequacy and number of the pro-posed rhetorical devices.
As stated above, this mayreveal the need to adjust procedure Impairment-Invalidate to enable it to control the number of the pro-posed Peripheral RDs.At present, research is in progress to extend theimpairment invalidation paradigm to the generation ofother types of rhetorical devices, such as Descriptions,Instantiations and Causal explanations, and to devise analgorithm to sort the generated messages according torhetorical considerations (Zukerman 1990b).
In addition,an alternative representation for MBs which keeps trackof the sources of an inference is being considered.Further esearch is required to recognize and rectify pos-sible misconceptions in the Common-sense InferenceRules, and to characterize conditions for the generationof rhetorical devices which satisfy a number of com-municative goals.
Finally, the effect of the knowledgerepresentation a d the rules of inference on the types ofthe proposed rhetorical devices needs to be furtherinvestigated.Conc lus ionThis paper offers a text planning mechanism which sup-ports the generation of explanations tailored to particulartypes of users.
Our mechanism generates Peripheral RDswhich help convey an intended message by anticipatingand preventing potential impairments to a listener'scomprehension process.
To this effect, it characterizesthese impairments in terms of a model of a fistener'sbeliefs and inferences, and simulates a fistener'scomprehension process on this model.
Clearly, this pro-tess does not dispense with the need to interact with alistener, but it addresses commonly occurring impair-ments, thereby focusing the interaction.
Furthermore, itis envisioned that the impairment invalidation mechan-ism will become a useful tool to guide the generation ofcogent responses to user follow-up queries, as it canpoint to issues which are potentially troublesome.162References\[Anderson, 1983\] J.R. Anderson.
