The algorithmicspecification of the semantic interpretationprocedures is order-free which distinguishes thesystem from other theories providingmodel-theoretic interpretation for naturallanguage.
Attention is focused on thecomputational advantages of a semanticinterpretation system that takes as its inputfunctional structures as opposed to syntacticsurface-structures.A pressing problem for computational l inguistics is the developmentof linguistic theories which are supported by strong independentlinguistic argumentation, and which can, simultaneously, serveas a basis for efficient implementations in language processingsystems.
Linguistic theories with these properties make itpossible for computational implementations to build directly on thework of linguists both in the area of  grammar-wr i t ing ,  and in thearea of theory development (cf.
universal conditions on anaphoricbinding, fi l ler-gap dependencies etc.
).Lexical-functional grammar (LFG) is a linguistic theory whichhas been developed with equal attention being paid to theoreticallinguistic and computational processing considerations (Kaplan &Bresnan 1981).
The linguistic theory has ample and broadmotivation (vide the papers in Bresnan 1982), and it istransparently implementable as a syntactic parsing system (Kaplan& Halvorsen forthcoming).
LFG takes grammatical relations to be ofprimary importance (as opposed to the transformational theory wheregrammatical functions play a subsidiary role).
Sentences arederived by means of a set of context-free phrase-structure rulesannotated with functional-schemata.
There are no transformationalrules.
The pivotal elements in the theory are the phrase-structurerules, and in particular, the lexical rules.
A typicalLFG-analysis is the treatment of the passive-construction impliedby the rules and lexical entries in (la-c).115116 P.-K. HALVORSEN(1)a.Phrase-structure rules (annotated with schemata determiningthe assignment of grammatical relations):S --> NP VP(?

Each phrase-structure tree isindexed.
The indices instantiate the up- and down-arrows in thefunctional schemata which are found in the phrase structurerules.
An up-arrow refers to the node dominating the node theschemata is attached to.
A down-arrow refers to the node whichcarries the functional schemata.
The result of the instantiationprocess is the set of functional equations in (2 c).
Theseequations describe the functional structure (f-structure) in (2d).The functional structures provide, in canonical form, arepresentation of the meaningful grammatical relations in thesentence.
The functional equations, mediate between theconstituent-structure and the functional-structure.
Eachfunctional equation determines an aspect of thefunctional-structure.
When the functional equations are solved118 P.-K. HALVORSENthey uniquely determine the functional-structure.
Moreover, theorder in which the equations are processed is immaterial for thefinal result (see Kaplan and Bresnan 1981).
The derivation offunctional-structures is order-free.
The semantic theory whichaccompanies the theory of functional structures provides, in itsturn, an order-free derivation of semantic representations fromfunctional structures.The theoretical problem of natural language interpretation canbe decomposed into three tasks: (i) Unraveling all possiblethematic relations holding in a sentence; (2) Composition of themeaning of the constituents of the sentence into a well-deflnedand coherent representation of the meaning of the entiresentence; (3) Specifying all possible scope andcontrol-relations holding in a sentence,The unraveling of the thematic relations in a sentence isalready accomplished in f-structure; no special moves aretherefore needed in the semantics to establish the propositionalequivalence of active-passive pairs or pairs with and without~ ,  Equi etc.. Notice that both the f-structure for theactive sentence, (2d), and the f-structure for the passivesentence, (3d), contain a f-structure with the predicate'buy< .... , .... >', and the arguments John and Cotta@e, Inc. aretied to the same argument positions in this predicate in theactive sentence as well as in the passive sentence, thusexpressing the truth-conditional equivalence of the twoutterances.The task of semantic composition and the determination ofscope relations require that semantic representations be derivedfrom the functional structures.Rather than translating functional structures into formulas ofstandard predicate calculus, f-structures are mapped into acyclicgraphs called semantic structures (cf.
4a).
Since semanticstructures are acyclic graphs, just like functional structures,symmetric constraining equations (cf.
2b and 3b) can be used todefine an order-free derivation of semantic structures fromfunctional structures just as functional equations yield anorder-free derivation of f-structures from annotatedphrase-structure trees.
Each constraining equation in theMapping from f-structure to semantic structure adds informationabout the semantic structure of a sentence.
Specif ical ly if anf-structure, f has a PRED whose value is the semantic fo rm~ ,then the equa\[ion (Mf PREDICATE)=~' is introduced, which tellsus that the semantic structure corresponding to f, Mr, has aPREDICATE attribute whose value is the translation inintensional logic of 5 .
Each constraining equation adds a bit ofinformation about the semantic structure, and just as in aj igsaw-puzzle what piece is found at what time is of noconsequence for the final outcome.
?It is the functional structure which drives the semanticcomposition, not the application of specific syntactic rules.This makes it possible to construct a highly constrained, anduniversal, theory of semantic composition: there are only a smallnumber of structurally distinct configurations in f-structure(the predicate-, argument-, quantifier-, control-, andadjunct-relations).
Explicit semantic composition rules for eachof these configurations have been constructed.
This enables theinterpretation of any well-formed f-structure.
Once the semanticcomposition rules for functional structures have been correctlyORDER-FREE SEMANTIC COMPOSITION 119stated they will extend to cover any sentence, which is assigned anf -structure by the grammar.
The composition rules do not have tobe revised as the coverage of the grammar is extended, or as newlanguages are described.
The semantics for the LFG-theory isclearly more easily transportable than the semantics of systemswhere each syntactic rule requires a special semantic rule (Bach1976).The semantic translation rules, working off of thef-structures in (2d) and (3d) give rise to constraining equationsthat determine the semantic structure in (4a) as the semanticrepresentation for both John bought Cottage, Inc___t and Cottage,IncL was bought by John,.
The semantic structurecorresponds to the formula of intensional logic in (4b).

There is no reflex ofsyntactic expressions without independent meaning (expletives, it,there, governed prepositions, by, etc.).
The values of theattribute PREDICATE are semantic functions, and the functionalarguments are identified by the the attribute ARGi  Semanticcomposition consists of the application of the functions to theintensions of the meanings of the functional arguments.The scope of NP's with quantifier phrases is explicit lyindicated in semantic structure, as are all occurrences of semanticarguments which the quantifiers bind.
The semantic reflex offunctional control is also explicated in semantic structure.The construction of meaning representations from f-structuresproceeds by successive approximation from any point in the sentenceby way of the symmetrical constraining equations.
The algorithmicspecification of the interpretation process does, therefore, notimpose any arbitrary constraints on tne order in which the semanticcomposition of the words should proceed.
Instead, one is free toimpose such constraints on the order of steps in the interpretationprocedure as proves to be psychologically and/or computationallymotivated.
The use of symmetric constraining equations and theresulting monotonic character of the mapping between f-structuresand meaning representations is also useful in clearing the way forinterpretation of sentence fragments.
As it stands, the procedurecan, if desired, proceed from left to right in a string of words,as they are being presented.
The composition of sentence meaningswithin the Montague Semantics framework, in contrast, typicallyproceed from the most deeply embedded constituent and outward (seeThomason 1976, Dowty et al1981).
Interleaving of syntactic andsemantic p rocess ing  is.
also facilitated when there are nounmotivated constraints on the order of steps in the semanticprocessing of the sentence.
Within this approach to semanticinterpretation it is also possible to let the order of steps in theparsing of a sentence be determined by efficiency considerations,which may vary~from sentence to sentence and even from phrase tophrase within a given sentence.
An imposition of order in theabstract specification of the composition process would limitimplementation choices prematurely.120 P.-K.
