The forego ingshows that these operat ions  are most lyaux i l i a ry  in nature,  the i r  main  purposebeing to improve the content  adequacyand the l ingu is t ic  acceptab i l i ty  of thet rans la t ion  text formed through the useof the R- level  representat ion ;  in a con-crete automat ic  t rans la t ion  system basedessent ia l l y  on ~he formal  model  we haveout l ined,  they may be reduced or even al-together  omit ted for var ious  pract ica lreasons.However,  whether  these supp lementaryoperat ions  be inc luded in an AT systemor not, it is c lear  that the system wil ldepend largely  for its e f f i c iency  on thechoice of the in termed ia te  level R. Itis p rec i se ly  this bas ic  level that weare now Go ing  to consider.Genera l  Requ i rementsFrom the point  of v iew of the purpos-es and pecu l ia r i t ies  of the t rans la t ionprocess,  there are two oppos i te  requi re-ments  that can be p laced  upon the inter-med ia te  formal ized representat ion  R inan automat ic  t rans la t ion  system.On the one hand, insofar  as transla-t ion bo i l s  down to t rans forming  the sur-face st ructure of  a text whi le  preserv-ing its content,  it seems safe to assu-me that i f  some ,components of  the text tobe t rans lated~ some features  of thesecomponents ,  or l inks between them are re-levant for the content  s t ructure of thistext, they may also prove of  impor tancefor choos ing the correct  t rans la t ionequ iva lents  for the text units.
Conseque-ntly, the adequate representat ion  R usedin au AT  system should be su f f i c ient ly"semant ic"  for  al l  the necessary  info~11a-t ion concern ing  the components ,  l inksand features  in quest ion  to be e i therexp l i c i t l y  g iven in this representat ionOr, at least, to be eas i ly  obta inab lef rom it.
To put it d i f ferent ly ,  represe-n ta t ion  R of a text p rocessed  must ref-lect its semant ic  st ructure wi th  suff i -c ient p rec i s ion  and in suf f ic ient  de-tail.On the other  hand, the s t ructures  ofthe source and the target l~ages  wil l ,as often as not, have certa in  featuresin co,non, this lead ing to an inev i tab leneut ra l i za t ion  of any ana lys is  t ransfor-mat ions  invo lv ing  such features,  by theinverse t rans fo~nat ions  dur ing  the syn-thesis  process.
Such t rans fo~nat ionswi l l  thus prove unnecessary  for t rans la-t ion purposes,  no mat ter  how in~ortantthey might  be as regards  the ful l  seman-tic ana lys is  of the text.
Accord ing ly ,representat ion  R must  be su f f i c ient ly"super f ic ia l "  for its const ruc t ion  to in-corporate  the min imum poss ib le  of suchsuper f luous  t ransformat ions .As we see, the second requ i rement  pro-v ides a k ind of  l im i ta t ion  on the f i rstone, res t r i c t ing  the extent  and the me-thods of the exp l i ca t ion  necess i ta ted  bytile latterp of the semant ic  s t ructure  ofthe text.
Tak ing into account  both  ofthese requ i rements  wi l l  most  l ike ly  re-sult in a k ind  of a compromise  so lut ionsuggest ing  that in fo rmat ion  made expl i -cit in representat ion  R of  a cer ta in  textshould not inc lude all  the e lements  ofits semant ic  structure;  rather,  it shouldcover  only those of  them which  are apr io-ri known to be extens ive ly  used  in estab-l i sh ing  in ter - l~guage cor re la t ions  dur-ing t rans lat ion.With such a solut ion,  however,  onemust  be fu l ly  aware that real  texts wi l lconta in  a substant ia l  p ropr t ion  of caseswhere some text in fo rmat ion  over lookedby our  analys is  might  eventua l ly  turn outre levant  for t rans lat ion.
If we do notwant to give up the idea of  adequate lyp rocess ing  such texts as impract i cab lein pr inc ip le ,  it seems usefu l  to impose athird requ i rement  on representat ion  R -the requ i rement  of "exhaust iveness"  whichmay be fo rmulated  as fol lows.
Al l  infor-mat ion  conta ined in a natura l  languagetext and not made expl ic i t  in its inter-mediate  representat ion  must  be preservedwi th in  this representat ion;  i f  poss ib le,it should be preserved ful ly  and withoutchang ing  its or ig ina l  (natural  language)form, so that there might  be no acc iden-tal losses or d is tor t ions .I f  so, the subst i tu t ion  of the forma-l ized representat ion  R for the or ig ina ltext wi l l  not exc lude the poss ib i l i ty  of175addi t iona l  analys is  ~llplifying the res-u l ts  of tile s tandard ana lyz ing  procedureand prov id ing  access  to some extra  infor-mat ion  that may be required.
This  is tosay that the l inguist  descr ib ing  themeans of t rans la t ing  concrete languageun i ts  w i th in  such a system wi l l  not  besubject  to the pressure  of too str ingentl im i ta t ions  o r ig inat ing  from the conven-t ions of  the system, ra ther  than fromthe nature  of  the mater ia l  he deals  with,and compl i ca t ing  h is  task (d i f f icu l tenough as it is).
~ leoret ica l ly ,  he wi l lbe free to use any text in fo rmat ion  (bo~"super f ic ia l "  and "deep") in  any way hemay f ind l ingu is t i ca l l y  appropr iate :whether  as source uni ts  to be rep lacedby t r~ is la t ion  equiva lents ,  or as condi-t ions determin ing  the equ iva lents  chos-en for some other  units,  or else as tra-ns la t ion  equ iva lents  themselves.The above pr inc ip les  are generalenough to a l low of var ious  ways of  imp-lement ing  them in a concrete automat ict rans la t ion  project .
We sl~all presenthere one attempt of  such imp lementat ionmade in de f in ing  the so-ca l led CombinedStructura l  Representat ion  to be used inthe system of Japanese-Russ ian  automat ict rans lat ion,  now under  deve lopment  atthe Inst i tute  of Or ienta l  Studies of  theAcademy of Sc iences of the USSR(~oscow)3.Combine d St, ruc, tural  Representat ion  (CSR),Tak ing  into account  the typo log ica lcor re la t ion  between the Japanese and theRuss lan  lan6~ages,  we cons ider  it neces-sary to speci fy  in the CSR of the in i t i -al Japanese texts, as well  as of theirRussiax, t rans lat ions,  f ive main  aspectsof  text structure:  the lexico-granmlati-cal compos i t ion  of the text processed,its p red icate -ar~ iment  o rgan izat ion  onthe semant ico -syntact i c  level, the syn-tact ic  group ing  of its units,  the ~apho-tic re la t ions  between them, and the pecu-l iar i t ies  of their  l inear  arrangement .Wi th in  the CSR the cor respond ing  f ivetypes of  l ingu is t ic  in fo rmat ion  about thetext form separate components  ~l ich  wi l lnow be d i scussed  in turn, most ly  from thepoint  of v iew of their  cons i s tency  witllthe general  requ i rements  stated above.Lexico-~|r~lati .cal  compos i t ion~e component  of the CSR concernedwith the lexico-granm~atical compos i t ionof the text is in tended to conta in  expl i -cit descr ip t ions  of al l  lexemes presentor impl ied (if e l l ips is  is the case) inthe text under  cons iderat ion,  as wel l  asof al l  g rammat ica l  (morpho-syntaet ica l )e lements  accompany ing  them in the corres-pond ing  word forms or  quas i -word  forms(units taken to be funct iona l ly  ana logousto word forms).
The descr ip t ions  requir -ed must include, apart  from the s~nbolsof  the uni ts  involved,  in fo rmat ion  abouttheir  mean ings  wi th in  the text in quest-ion and about their  re levancy  or i rrele-vancy as regards the process  of  its tra-ns lat ion.~le operat ions  necessary  to obta inthis component  of the CSR ~len ana lyz ingthe in i t ia l  Japanese text wi l l  ev ident lycompr ise i so la t ing  separate word formsand determin ing  their  internal  s t ructure(in terms of lexemes and morpho log ic  mar-kers),  reso lv ing  ~nb i~ i t ies  for allun i ts  establ ished;  e l im inat ing  synonymywhere it is man i fes ted  as supp lementaryd i s t r ibut ion  or free var ia t ion  of morpho-logic units;  detect ing  phraseo log ica lword combinat ions  ~d reduc ing  them toa one-word symbol; g iv ing  special  labelsto those word forms or parts  of wordforms which  p lay ~ aux i l ia ry  role in thetext ana lyzed and requi re  no special  tran-s lat ion equiva lents ;  f i l l ing  in the uni tsomit ted in the source text i f  their  ab-sence obscures its s t ructure  and h indersthe t rans la t ion  process  (due to the di f -ferences between the ru les of l inguist ice l l ips is  in the two lmlguages) ,  etc.From this it fo l lows that the lexico-granm~atical compos i t ion  of a text cannotbe de f in i t i ve ly  es tab l i shed in the courseof  its analys is  wi thout  d rawing  upon in-fo rmat ion  about its s t ructura l  characte-r ist ics.
The same k ind  of  in fo rmat ion  isalso needed ~en work ing  with this compo-nent  of the CSR in the synthes is  process(chief ly  in connect ion  with such meansof express ing  structura l  re lat ions  asgrammat ica l  agreement  and government ,typical  of the Russ ian  l~,guage).Therefore~ in dec id ing  what languageun i ts  are to be descr ibed  as permiss ib lein the g iven con~onent  of the CSR, and~at  status is to be a t t r ibuted  to themwi th in  its framework,  spec i f ica l ly ,  wh ichun i ts  it is best to treat as ind iv idualwords and ~l ich ones should rather  beregarded as mean ingfu l  parts  of words -morphemes  (the prob lem being of part icu-lar  importance for  Japanese where no re-gu lar  graphica l  means are used in writ -ing to separate words from each other),we bel ieve it adv isab le  to pay speciala t tent ion  to the funct ions  of  the corres-pond ing un i ts  in the general  s t ructure ofthe text and in the system of operat ionsused for  its process ing.
With this a im inview, we have dev ised  an operat iona l  cri-ter ion of  d is t ingu ish ing  words and theirmean ingfu l  parts, based on the pr inc ip leof the homogene i ty  of the levels  of  textp rocess ing"  and on the requ i rement  thateach level 's  uni ts  should have st ructura l -ly s ign i f i cant  funct ions wi th in  the level176i tself ,  whi le  there should also exist  awe l l -de f ined  (a l though not necessar i l yone-to-one)  cor respondence  between cer-tain subsets of uni ts  be long ing  to theadjacent  levels of process ing.
Accord ingto this cr i ter ion,  the status of  separ-ate words is just i f ied,  among others,for  such Japanese uni ts  as the so-ca l led"causat ive vo ice"  marker  -ser  u / - sas~the "condi t ional  mood" marker  -~ ,  thenegat ion  marker  -nai  (at least, in con-d i t ional  contexts~d some others.Ajnong uni ts  ftulctionally ana logous to in-dependent  word forms (and, consequent ly ,appear ing  as such wi th in  the CSR), arealso c lass i f ied  punctuat ion  marks whichare, to our mind, quite s imi lar  to wordsin that they can be mean ingfu l  and cancor respond to def in i te  t rans lat ion  equi-va lents  (or p lay  the role of such, cf.Japanese ka vs. Russ ian ?
).In this way, so far as the pos i t ion  ofa uni t  in text structure and in the sys-tem of t rans lat ion  t rans format ions  is re-lated to the mean ing  of this unit ,  ourgenera l  p r inc ip les  of descr ib ing  the le-x i co -grammat ica l  compos i t ion  of texts intheir  CSR conform to the requi rement  ofits "semant ic i ty" .
On the other  hand, the"exhaust iveness"  requi rement  is also met,s ince we mm/?e it a point  not to leave outof the CSR any text elements,  up to thosethat serve essent ia l ly  as surface mark-ers of other l inguist ic  units  made expl i -cit in this representat ion,  and do notthemselves  par t i c ipate  to any s ign i f icantextent in the semant ic  operat ions  prov id-ed in the system (e.g.
Japanese "case"part ic les;  Russ ian morpho log ica l  catego-r ies of case, gender  and number  of adjec-tives; "surface" l inguist ic  express ionof " lexical  funct ions"  and their  t ransla-t ion equivalents,  etc.
).P red icate -argument  o rgan izat ion  of thetext on the semant ico -syntact ie  leve lThis component  of the CSR representssemant ico -syntact ic  l inks between wordsand/or  quas i -words  cor respond ing  to theirp red icate -arz~ment  re lat ions and, accor-dingly,  const i tu t ing  meaningfu l  textunits.
It is common knowledge that thesurface express ion of these uni ts  islanguage-spec i f i c  whi le  their  semanticcontent  is genera l ly  assumed to be of amore or less un iversa l  nature.
So in tra-ns la t ion  they must  e i ther  remain essen-t ia l ly  the same (natural ly,  wi th  all thenecessary  mod i f i ca t ions  of their  surfacemarkers)  or must  be t ransformed by cer-tain formal ru les depend ing  on the seman-tic in terpretat ion  of the l inks in ques-t ion and on their  re lat ion  with the mean-ing of the uni ts  l inked.The lexico-sy1~tactic t rans lat ion trans-format ions  ment ioned are most colmnonlyused  where the source and the targetlanguages have apprec iab le  typologica ld i f ferences.
This is p rec i se ly  the casewi th  the Japanese-Russ ian  cor re lat ion(a simple example: kate -we mannenhi tsu-o nusumaremash i ta ,  lit.

Bear ing thisin mind we have chosen the dependencygrammar  to represent  the pred icate -ar -gument  structure of texts in their  CSR,p re fer r ing  it to its a l ternat ive  - theimmediate const i tuent  system, for accor-d ing to a number  of specia l ists ,  thistype of t rans format ions  is eas ier  todescr ibe  in dependency  terms.One of the central  l ingu is t ic  prob-lems connected with  present ing  the pre-dicate-arL~nnent structure of a text inits CSR is which  among the var ious (~u~doften semant ica l ly  over lapping)  dependen-cies between the text un i ts  should be se-lected for expl ic i t  descr ipt ion.
In solv-ing this p rob lem we proceed from thepr inc ip le  of the poss ib i l i ty  of "imme-diate semantic substant iat ion"  of thedependenc ies  to be selected.
It can bespeci f ied as the fo l lowing  requi rementbear ing  on the ways and methods of des -cr ib ing words and grammat ica l  construc-t ions when compi l ing the l inguist ic  in-format ion for the automat ic  t rans lat ionsystem:- all syntact ic  dependenc ies  registe-red in the CSR of  a certa in text mustrea l ize  some semant ico -syntact i c  valen-c ies  of the lexical  or grammat ica l  uni tspresent  in it (and usua l ly  forming partof the lex ico -grammat ica l  compos i t ion  ofthe word forms or quas i -word  forms l ink-ed by the cor respond ing  dependenc ies) .These valencies,  in thei r  turn, mustd i rec t ly  corre late with the semant iccharacter i s t i cs  of the un i ts  they areascr ibed to, semantic  cons iderat ionsv iewed as the major  factor  under ly ingtheir  ass ignment  to those units.
One im-portant  cons iderat ion  of this k ind con-sists in pre fer r ing  the descr ip t ionswhere the maximum poss ib le  of the valen-cies env isaged could be rea l i zed in con-crete texts by two-word combinat ions  andthe maximum poss ib le  of such combinat ionscould be checked for their  semant ic  ac-ceptab i l i ty  (cons istency)  wi thout  regardto any uni ts  outs ide them.Apart  f rom the s i tuat ions where someof the syntact ica l ly  l inked uni ts  perfoxnain the text processed aux i l ia ry  funct ions(thus hav ing  no independent  semantic  con-tent) the app l i cat ion  of the above cr ite-r ia can only be l imi ted for  reasons ofeconomy and ef fect ive cont ro l lab i l i ty  of177the l in~ is t i c  descr ipt ion.From the above it can be in ferred thatthe l inguist ic  in fo rmat ion  used to reveal~u\]d/or process  the pred icate -argumentstructure of concrete texts should com-bine data  on the means of surface expres-sion of  the l inks invo lved (i.e.
word or-der, funct ion words, etc.)
w i th  fa i r lydeta i led  semant ic  descr ip t ions  of thewords to be fin/ted and of their  combina-tor ia l  potent ia l i t ies .
To prov ide theformal tools necessary  for const ruc t ingsuch descr ip t ions  we have dev ised a spe-cial  fo rmal ized semantic  language SLS,the character i s t i c  p roper t ies  of whichca/l be br ie f ly  out l ined as fol lows.The vocabu lary  of SL compr ises  threecategor ies  of the so-ca l led semantic  ele-ments: categor ia l  elements,  encyc lopae-dic e lements  and ident i fy ing  elements.Among these the lead ing role belongs tothe catez'orial e lements  which are g ivenspecial  descr ip t ions  const i tu t ing  a k indof  formal ized semantic  ~'ra~nmar of the na-tural language.
The sy~tax of SL, usedto combine semant ic  e lements  into seman-tic formulae~ accounts  both for  the se-:**antic re lat ions es tab l i shed  between thecomponents  of such a formula  and for i tscommunicat ive  organ izat ion  determin ingthe behav iour  of its components  as re-gards tile logic operat ions  tllat can beappl ied  to the formula  as a whole.
Fromthe formal point  of v iew a semant ic  for-mula  is a l inear  sequence of symbols,s t ructura l ly  equ iva lent  to a special  typeof a dependency  tree where the nodes canbe labeled by tile symbols not only ofs ingle sems/~tic elements,  but also oftheir  combinat ions (subt rees)o f  8x~y length.Sema/2tic formulae caxl be employed toexpress: I) semant ic  de f in i t ions  of natu-ral l~u~G-uage tu~its (from a separate wordup to a whole text); 2) their  parad igma-tic sem~mtic  features;  3) their  syntagma-tic semant ic  proper t ies  (semantic inter-pretat ions  of  their  syntact ic  va lenc ies) .An  important  d i s t ingu ish ing  characte-r is t ics  of SL is that it a f fords  formalder ivab i l i ty  of in fo rmat ion  about the se-max~tic paradiLnnatic and syntagm,atic fea-tures of ls/~guage uni ts  from their  seman-tic def in i t ions.
This helps to make thesema~tic descr ip t ions  of these uni ts  morecompact  (by e l im inat ing  the unnecessaryre i te ra t ion  of essent ia l l y  the sarape data)and to improve their  re l iab i l i ty ,  owingto tl~e poss ib i l i ty  of more ob jec t ive lyeva luat ing  the adequacy of  semant ic  def i -n i t ions  on the basis  of such a cr i ter ionas the degree of cor re la t ion  between thesynta&~natic propert ies  of a unit  der iv-able from its def in i t ion,  on the one hand,and its actual  semantic  eombinab i l i ty  asobserved in real texts, on the otherha/id.

Thef irst  exp lanat ion  is that one of the word-group boundar ies  in the g iven Russ iansentence separates the negat ion  He("not") f rom the whole of the fragmentfo l lowing it in the l inear  sequence ofthis sentence :HaHa~HBa~Zeb 6~ ~a~eeom\[ m~M H0~BSOBQTBC2 ~0nr0e BpeMs("wear out even if they are used for along time"), so that the f ragment c itedis in terpreted  as an integra l  seme/itieo-syntact ic  unit, this g iv ing r ise  to theimpl icat ion  to be avoided.
Accord ing  tothe other  explanat ion,  the boundary  res-pons ib le  for the in terpretat ion  of theRuss ian sentence runs between the wholeof its in i t ia l  f ragment Cpe~H HCH0~B3y-eMNX HaM~ Be~e~ ~0MamHer0 06~x0~a HeTTaEHX, KOT0pBIe 6BI He ~JHa~HBa~CB("Among the things we use da i ly  thereare none that do not wear out") and theremain ing  sequence ~axe e0n~ HmH Hons-SOBaTBCa ~0zr0e BpeM~ ("even if theyare used for a long time").
From thisstandpoint ,  the false impl icat ion  is ac-counted for by the poss ib i l i ty ,  sugges-ted by group ing the sentence uni ts  intothe above two fragments,  of  in terpret ingand/or  t rans forming these independent lyof each other, thus obta in ing~ e  Hs ~CH0X~syeM~x HaM~ Beme~ ~0-MamHero o~xo~a ~sHamHBa~Tca, ~a~eeczH HMM HO~BSOBaTBCS ~onroe Bpems("All of  the things we use da i ly  wearout t even i f  used for a long time").No matter  which  one of the two expla-nat ions be taken as true (the second oneseeming more p laus ib le,  whi le the f irstone suggest ing  s impler  check-ups in pro-cess in G texts) it is c lear  that the tran-s lat ion prob lem is to achieve in Russ ianthe same syntact ic  group ing as in theor iginal ,  by in t roduc ing  the correspond-ing lexical  and/or  pos i t iona l  ( l inear)modi f icat ions ,  e.g.

~ % ~  ~ewa-re-no seikatsu sui un -o  i tsumade-moxoku saseru koto -~a d e ~ .Here it is essent ia l  that the negat ionmarker,  as well  as the express ion  of con-dit ion,  which in the t rans lat ion  sentencemust  take a pos i t ion  d i f ferent  from theone its Japanese counterpart  occupies inthe or ig ina l  word-sequence,  should notinterpose between the two members  of theco -ord inat lve - type  word-group present inthe sentence (for clar ity,  we have enclo-sed tills group in brackets) .
That  is,the t rans lat ion  must be (l~iglish be ings t ructura l ly  s imi lar  to Russ ian in this-179--respect) :I f  the workers  do not  ~te  ~d ~forward 2o l i t i ca l  ~emands l  we shal lnever  be able to raise our l i fe leveland not* I f  the workers  un i te  and do not putforward po l i t ica l  demands .

"Genera l ly  speaking, the correct  tran-s lat ion of the last example (as well  asof other  const ruct ions  exp la inab le  interms of co -ord inat ive  reduct ion)  couldalso be obta ined wi thout  recourse to tllein fo rmat ion  about syntact ic  word-grouping.Instead, one could use a "deeper" descr i -pt ion of the text to be trans lated,  wi the l l ip t ica l  const ruct ions  t ransformed intotheir  ful l  representat ions .
However,  thisk ind of t rans format ion  would  be bas ica l lysuperf luous,  for in the synthes is  processit would  be necessary  to reduce the con-s t ruct ions  in quest ion  back to their  el-l ipt ica l  form us ing  but s l ight ly  d i f fe-rent rules.
It seems therefore pre ferab lefor the operat ions  of  t rans la t ion  properto result  d i rect ly  in axx e l l ip t ica l  con-s t ruct ion analogous to the or ig ina l  onea~d d i f fe r ing  only  in deta i l s  of itssurface express ion  (such as the pos i t ionof negat ion  in the above example),  speci-f ied by the subsequent  synthes is  proce-dure.So we see that whi le  the  component  ofthe CSR under  d i scuss ion  reg is ters  onlysemant ica l l y  s ign i f i cant  phenomena oftext structure,  the means of represent ingthem in it remain  essent ia l l y  superf ic ia l ,so as to sat is fy  both the "semant ic i ty"and the "super f ic ia l i ty"  requi rements .Anaphor_ic re la t ions  between text  un i tsFor  in terpret ing  texts in respect  oftlleir sicalification and espec ia l ly  deno-tation, the structure of  anaphor ic  rela-t ions between their  un i ts  is on the wholeno less important  than their  pred icate-argument  structure.
However,  the anapho-ric s t ructure is expressed main ly  by le-x ical  repet i t ion,  and this can be eas i lyaccounted for i f  we require that as longas one text is dealt  with, one and thesame t rans lat ion  equ iva lent  should be se-lected, so far as possib le,  for al l  oc-currences of  one and the same lexeme (le-xeme being def ined as a word taken in oneof its var ious lexical  meanings) .
G iventhis requ i rement  (which appears  to be na-tural  enough and, but for some specialcases, easy to comply  with),  there is noneed to inc lude this st ructure in theCSR in its ful l  form.
It seems suf f ic ientto ind icate it on ly  for  those types oflanguage uni ts  which d i rec t ly  depend fortheir  t rans la t ion  on the proper t ies  oftheir  antecedents  in the text at hand.In Japanese (as also in other  langua-gas) there are two types of such units.The f irst type are pronouns:  whentranslat ing,  say, the pronoun sore, thechoice of  one of tile words: th i~,  lle~she, i ts  the ,  o~ etc.
, -  as its textequiva lent  wi l l  be determined,  amongother  things, by the syntact ic  class ofthe uni t  chosen as the equiva lent  of itssaltecedent.
If this unit  is a noun, onewil l  also need to \]~low its number  and(for Russia~l) gender.The second type of un i ts  which  can-not be t rans lated proper ly  wi thout  in-fo rmat ion  about their  antecedents  ismore specif ic.
These are words which aregraph ica l ly  ident ica l  wi th components  ofmore complex units,  also lex ica l i zedfrom the point  of v iew of their  semanticbehaviour j  and which ca~1 funct ion  ass t ructura l  subst i tutes  for the latter.When used in this funct ion,  such wordsmust  be rep laced e i ther  by the transla-t ion equ iva lents  of their  6uatecederlts Ior by pronouns (with the data on theseantecedents  used in the s~me fash ion asin t rans la t ing  usual  pronouns) .
Anyway,their  own tra/~slation equ iva lents  areru led out.Thus, the word n imotsu,  mean ing"lu~'gage" if used independent ly ,  wil l  bet rans lated as "tllem" or "these parce ls"in the context  of the sentenceKo,limo t su-gakar i -  ~'a mazu nimo t su-nomegata -o  hakar imasu,where~Izmotsu  is subst i tuted for kon imo-t su  ("parcel")  :The c lerk dea l ing  with )arcels f irst~i~s  ~e~ t t!~9_2~3e~3~AS regards all  other  types of lexi-cal units,  our  approach is that the exis-tence of' anaphor ic  re lat ions  between themsllould be checked and the re lat ions them-selves reg is tered  in the CSR for fur therp rocess ing  only in those in f requent  situ-at ions (due most ly  to d i ss imi la r i t ies  inthe combinator ia l  p roper t ies  of the ori-g inal  language words and of their  tra/Is-la t ion equiva lents ,  this necess i ta t ingthe use of synonymous transfor~nations)where it is imposs ib le  to ful f i l  theabove requi rement  of t rans la t ing  di f fe-rent occur rences  of the same lexeme bythe sa~,le equivalent ,  a/Id one has to makesure that employ ing  d i f ferent  equ iva lentsin this case does not af fect  the or ig inalanaphor ic  st ructure of the traxlslatedtext.L inear  arranK~ement of text un i tsIn dea l ing  with l inear  ar ra~'ementof un i ts  in a ~ext in the frs/nework ofaxl automat ic  tra~islation system, it isimportalat to d i s t ingu ish  between twotypes of their  pos i t iona l  (word-order)180 "re la t ions  requ i r ing  d i f fe rent  p rocess ingdur ing  t rans lat ion.I f  the f irst type of  such re lat ionsoccurs between two text units,  the posi -t ion of one of them in respect  to theother  is mere ly  a sur face syntact ic  mar-ker  showing the presence (or absence) of,says some semantico-sy~Itact ic l ink be-tween the two, an anaphor ic  re la t ion  be-tween them, a syntact ic  word -group  boun-dary, and so on.
In case of the secondtype such pos i t ion  is me~nillgul in it-sel~', i r respect ive  of whether  it shouldor should not be taken into accotult whenes tab l i sh ing  cer ta in  syntact ic  l inks orboundar ies :  it shows the re lat ive posi -t ions of the un i ts  in quest ion in theco~mnunicative s t ructure  of the text (i.e.from the point  of v iew of its funct iona lperspect ive) .It should be noted  that the oppos i t ionof  these two types of pos i t iona l  rela-t ions is not  the same as that of r ig id(fixed) and free word order: whi le  free.word order  is a lways "semant ic"  to someextent,  r ig id  word order  ca/is to ourmind, cor respond to both cases, depend-ing on whether  the g iven syntact ic  con-s t ruct ion wi th  r ig id word order  corre la-tes in the language under  considerat ionwith any a l te rnat ive  const ruct ions  pro-v id ing  the same pred icate -argument  struc-ture alld/or syntact ic  g roup ing  of theirEomponents~ but ass ign ing  them a di f fe-rent l inear  arra/l~'ement (a poss ib le  exam-ple of such a l te rnat ive  const ruct ionswhich  can be cons idered as dependent  fortheir  se lect ion  on the word order  requi-red, ra ther  than vice versa, is furn ish-ed by pred icat ive  const ruc t ions  d i f fer -ing in their  vo ice value).Guided by the "ex/laustiveness" pr in-ciple, we judge it expedient  for the CSRto conta in  in fo rmat ion  both about the"mea/lingful" axld the "auxi l iary"  type ofword -order  re lat ions,  thouz% representedand employed in d i f fe rent  ways.The sphere of employTnent of the "auxi-l iary word -order  in fo rmat ion  is pract i -ca l ly  l imi ted to the ana lys is  and synthe-sis procedures.
Dur ing the analys is  phasethis in fo rmat ion  serves main ly  as a meansof  revea l ing  and formal ly  represent inguni ts  and construct ions per ta in ing  too ther  components  of the CSR; in the syn-thesis  phase it is used to obta in thecorrect  form of the same type of un i tsand constxnlctions in the target language.The cor respond ing  facts of the l inear  ar-rangement  of the text do not p lay any in-dependent  role e i ther  in its semant icp rocess ing  or in choos ing  t rans la t ionequ iva lents  for its units,  so it is per-fect ly  suf f ic ient  to regard them as justone of  the var ious  features of tile uni tsand const ruct ions  involved,  importantenough to be reg is te red  in their  l ingui-stic descr ipt ions ,  but const i tu t ing  noseparate objects  of descr ipt ion .
To in-corporate these facts in the CSi~, we re-sort to nuunbering the words in the textp rocessed  in the order  of their  succes-sive occurrence (tile resu l t ing  numbersused also, in combinat ion  with some otherdata, as their  ident i f ie rs  throughoutthe process ing) .If, on tile contrary,  a const ruct ionis character i zed  by a mean ingfu l  word-order  re la t ion  between its lex ica l  com-ponents,  it is g iven the status of aspecia l  "pos i t ional  unit",  d i s t inct  fromthe const rnc t ion  i tse l f  and representedexp l i c i t l y  in ~he CSI~.
Such a unit  di-rec t ly  par t i c ipates  in semantic  opera-tions, inc lud ing  those of t rans la t ionproper,  which means that it must  flareits own descr ip t ion  (in part icu lar ,  itso~I t rans la t ion  equiva lent) .
It standsto reason that the range of inter-lo/l~-uage cor respondences  invo lv ing  pos i t io -nal  un i ts  of e i ther  the source or thetarget laxlguage is not res t r i c ted  to thisc lass of uni ts  alone, as the communicat -ive o rgan izat ion  of  text COjl a lso be con-veyed by some types of  syntact ic  const-ruct ions  and lex ica l  elements.
An exam-ple is the Japanese par t i c le~ as usedin independent  sentences (or, sometimes,in the main c lauses of  complex senten-ces), where its best Russ ian  equiva lent(if the salne type of p red icat ive  const-ruct ion  is used) is the reverse order  ofthe subject  and the predicate.As we see, here also, as in the othercomponents  of the CSR, there is a compro-mise between the "semant ic i ty"  and the"super f i c ia l i ty"  requi rements .
On the oneha/Id, expl ic i t  ind icat ion  of tile word-order  re la t ions  found to be meazlingfulin the text processed  character i zes  someaspects  of  its semant ic  structure.
Onthe other  ha/~d, the forth of "pos i t iona luni ts"  chosen to represent  them is ra-ther super f ic ia l  in that it does not dis-p lay the semantic  cor re la t ions  underlying-the interchs/M/eabi l i ty of these un i tswi th other  st ructura l  text features (suchas the se lect ion of the nexus vs. junc-t ion form of express ing  the pred icate-ar~ument  dependenc ies  between text units;the use of " re lat iona l"  words~ of the0per ,  or Funci  type and the like; the oc-currence of emphat ic  par t ic les  and con-struct ions,  etc.
).Conc lus ionIn the forego ing we have tr ied toshow the way the Combined Structura l  Re-p resentat ion  of text re f lects  the requi-rements  of "semant ic i ty" ,  "super f ic ia l i -ty" and "exhaust iveness"  fo rmulated  at1'81tile beg inn ing  of the paper  as essent ia lfor  the basic level  of  fonual ly  repre-sent ing  text st ructure in an automat ict rans la t ion  system.
We shall now br ie f lyrecap i tu la te  ~he points.The "semant ic i ty  ' requ i rement  is ac-counted for in the CSR, in the f irstplace, by the very  poss ib i l i ty  p rov idedin it of exp l ic i t ly  descr ib ing  the f ivemost important  aspects  of text s t ructureand composi t ion,  as stated above.
Thequest for "semant ic i ty"  forms also thebas is  of the pr inc ip les  we employ in se-lec t ing  concrete in fo rmat ion  to be madeexpl ic i t .
Among these one can ment ionthe cr i ter ion  of  s t ructura l  s ign i f i canceof the uni ts  to be represented  in theCSR as separate words or quas i -words;  thepr inc ip le  of " immediate sems/itic substa~-t iat ion" of  the predicate-arguJnent synta-ctic re lat ions  reg is tered  in it; the re-qu i rement  of supp ly ing  the e lements  ofthe lex ico -grammat ica l  compos i t ion  ofthe text under  cons iderat ion,  as well  asof  its l inear  ar rangement ,  with indica-t ions of  their  mean ingfu l  or aux i l i a ryrole w i th in  this text; the employmentof a special  formal  language to def inethe semantic  proper t ies  of words andword-combinat ions ,  etc.The "superficiality" of the CSR isseen, erelong other  things, in the factthat this level of  text representat ionenv isages  the use of lex ico -syntact i ct rans la t ion  equ iva lents  and does not ne-cessar i ly  requi re  decompos i t ion  of lexe-rues into combinat ions  of smal ler  un i tsof mea/~ing, such decompos i t ion  cons ider-ed appropr ia te  but in comparat ive ly  rarecases  of descr ip t ive  and in terpreta t ivet rans lat ion.
Other  features of the CSRor ig inat ing  from the "super f i c ia l i ty"pr inc ip le  are absence of exhaust ive  in-format ion about the anaphor ic  s t ructureof the text, inc lus ion  of only  those da-ta on syntact ic  word -group ing  which  areof  importance for the t rans la t ion  pro-cess, d i rect  tr6u\]slation of e l l ip t ica lconstruct ions ,  wherever  possib le,  etc.F inal ly,  the "exhaust iveness"  require-ment  is spec i f ied  as  w:hat may be ca l ledthe " lose-noth ing"  pr inc ip le  of construc-t ing tlle CSR.
It inca/is that when specia llabels  are fetched in it to exp l ic i t lyd i sp lay  var ious  st ructura l  e lements  im-p l i c i t l y  present  in the surface form ofthe text at hand, tile surface text mark-ers (such as the "auxi l iary"  type wordorder;  morpho log ica l  features  express ingt~rammatical agreement  or government;funct ion  words and punctuat ion  marks ha-v ing  no independent  t rans la t ion  equiva-lents, a~d so on), though hav ing  beenused a l ready to reveal  those elements,are not e l iminated from the representa-tion being formed.
They are mere ly  sup-p lemented  by the des ignat ions  of the elo-me\]its revealed, as wel l  as by formal in-d icat ions  of their  o~al aux i l ia ry  nature,and thus remain access ib le  for any fur-ther analys is  that might prove useful ,should it tur~ out that their  f~mct ionsin the text are not l imited to just iden-t i fy ing tile uni ts  a l ready  made expl ic it .Notes1 3.M.~anan~?Ha.
