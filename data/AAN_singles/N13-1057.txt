In this paper, wepropose algorithms for creation of new reversebilingual dictionaries from existing bilingualdictionaries in which English is one of the twolanguages.
Our algorithms exploit the simi-larity between word-concept pairs using theEnglish Wordnet to produce reverse dictionaryentries.
Since our algorithms rely on availablebilingual dictionaries, they are applicable toany bilingual dictionary as long as one of thetwo languages has Wordnet type lexical ontol-ogy.1 IntroductionThe Ethnologue organization1 lists 6,809 distinctlanguages in the world, most of which are resource-poor.
Most existing online bilingual dictionaries arebetween two resource-rich languages (e.g., English,Spanish, French or German) or between a resource-rich language and a resource-poor language.
Thereare languages for which we are lucky to find a singlebilingual dictionary online.
For example, the Uni-versity of Chicago hosts bilingual dictionaries from29 Southeast Asian languages2, but many of theselanguages have only one bilingual dictionary online.Existing algorithms for creating new bilingualdictionaries use intermediate languages or interme-diate dictionaries to find chains of words with thesame meaning.
For example, (Gollins and Sander-son, 2001) use lexical triangulation to translate inparallel across multiple intermediate languages and1http://www.ethnologue.com/2http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/list.htmlfuse the results.
They query several existing dictio-naries and then merge results to maximize accuracy.They use four pivot languages, German, Spanish,Dutch and Italian, as intermediate languages.
An-other existing approach for creating bilingual dictio-naries is using probabilistic inference (Mausam etal., 2010).
They organize dictionaries in a graphtopology and use random walks and probabilisticgraph sampling.
(Shaw et al 2011) propose a setof algorithms to create a reverse dictionary in thecontext of single language by using converse map-ping.
In particular, given an English-English dictio-nary, they attempt to find the original words or termsgiven a synonymous word or phrase describing themeaning of a word.The goal of this research is to study the feasibilityof creating a reverse dictionary by using only one ex-isting dictionary and Wordnet lexical ontology.
Forexample, given a Karbi3-English dictionary, we willconstruct an ENG-AJZ dictionary.
The remainder ofthis paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, wediscuss the nature of bilingual dictionaries.
Section3 describes the algorithms we propose to create newbilingual dictionaries from existing dictionaries.
Re-sults of our experiments are presented in Section 4.Section 5 concludes the paper.2 Existing Online Bilingual DictionariesPowerful online translators developed by Googleand Bing provide pairwise translations (includingfor individual words) for 65 and 40 languages, re-spectively.
Wiktionary, a dictionary created by vol-unteers, supports over 170 languages.
We find a3Karbi is an endangered language spoken by 492,000 peo-ple (2007 Ethnologue data) in Northeast India, ISO 639-3 codeAJZ.
ISO 693-3 code for English is ENG.524large number of bilingual dictionaries at PanLex4including an ENG-Hindi5 and a Vietnamese6-ENGdictionary.
The University of Chicago has a numberof bilingual dictionaries for South Asian languages.Xobdo7 has a number of dictionaries, focused onNortheast India.We classify the many freely available dictionariesinto three main kinds.?
Word to word dictionaries: These are dictionar-ies that translate one word in one language toone word or a phrase in another language.
Anexample is an ENG-HIN dictionary at Panlex.?
Definition dictionaries: One word in one lan-guage has one or more meanings in the secondlanguage.
It also may have pronunciation, partsof speech, synonyms and examples.
An exam-ple is the VIE-ENG dictionary, also at Panlex.?
One language dictionaries: A dictionary of thiskind is found at dictionary.com.We have examined several hundred online dictionar-ies and found that they occur in many different for-mats.
Extracting information from these dictionariesis arduous.
We have experimented with five existingbilingual dictionaries: VIE-ENG, ENG-HIN, and adictionary supported by Xobdo with 4 languages:Assamese8, ENG, AJZ, and Dimasa9.
We considerthe last one to be a collection of 3 bilingual dictio-naries: ASM-ENG, AJZ-ENG, and DIS-ENG.
Wechoose these languages since one of our goals is towork with resource-poor languages to enhance thequantity and quality of resources available.3 Proposed Solution ApproachA dictionary entry, called LexicalEntry, is a 2-tuple<LexicalUnit, Definition>.
A LexicalUnit is aword or a phrase being defined, also called definien-dum (Landau, 1984).
A list of entries sorted bythe LexicalUnit is called a lexicon or a dictionary.Given a LexicalUnit, the Definition associated withit usually contains its class and pronunciation, its4http://panlex.org/5ISO 693-3 code HIN6ISO 693-3 code VIE7http://www.xobdo.org/8Assamese is an Indo-European language spoken by about30 million people, but it is resource-poor, ISO 693-3 code ASM.9Dimasa is another endangered language from Northeast In-dia, spoken by about 115,000 people, ISO 693-3 code DIS.meaning, and possibly additional information.
Themeaning associated with it can have several Senses.A Sense is a discrete representation of a single aspectof the meaning of a word.
Thus, a dictionary entryis of the form <LexicalUnit, Sense1, Sense2, ?
?
?>.In this section, we propose a series of algorithms,each one of which automatically creates a reversedictionary, or ReverseDictionary, from a dictio-nary that translates a word in language L1 to a wordor phrase in language L2.
We require that at leastone of two these languages has a Wordnet type lexi-cal ontology (Miller, 1995).
Our algorithms are usedto create reverse dictionaries from them at variouslevels of accuracy and sophistication.3.1 Direct Reversal (DR)The existing dictionary has alphabetically sortedLexicalUnits in L1 and each of them has one ormore Senses in L2.
To create ReverseDictionary,we simply take every pair <LexicalUnit, Sense>in SourceDictionary and swap the positions of thetwo.Algorithm 1 DR AlgorithmReverseDictionary := ?for allLexicalEntryi ?
SourceDictionary dofor all Sensej ?
LexicalEntryi doAdd tuple <Sensej ,LexicalEntryi.LexicalUnit> toReverseDictionaryend forend forThis is a baseline algorithm so that we can com-pare improvements as we create new algorithms.If in our input dictionary, the sense definitionsare mostly single words, and occasionally a sim-ple phrase, even such a simple algorithm givesfairly good results.
In case there are long or com-plex phrases in senses, we skip them.
The ap-proach is easy to implement, and produces a high-accuracy ReverseDictionary.
However, the num-ber of entries in the created dictionaries are lim-ited because this algorithm just swaps the posi-tions of LexicalUnit and Sense of each entry in theSourceDictionary and does not have any methodto find the additional words having the same mean-ings.5253.2 Direct Reversal with Distance (DRwD)To increase the number of entries in the output dic-tionary, we compute the distance between wordsin the Wordnet hierarchy.
For example, the words"hasta-lipi" and "likhavat" in HIN have the meanings"handwriting" and "script", respectively.
The dis-tance between "handwriting" and "script" in Word-net hierarchy is 0.0, so that "handwriting" and"script" likely have the same meaning.
Thus, each of"hasta-lipi" and "likhavat" should have both mean-ings "handwriting" and "script".
This approachhelps us find additional words having the samemeanings and possibly increase the number of lexi-cal entries in the reverse dictionaries.To create a ReverseDictionary, for everyLexicalEntryi in the existing dictionary,we find all LexicalEntryj , i 6= j with dis-tance to LexicalEntryi equal to or smallerthan a threshold ?.
As results, we have newpairs of entries <LexicalEntryi.LexicalUnit,LexicalEntryj .Sense> ; then we swap positionsin the two-tuples, and add them into the Reverse-Dictionary.
The value of ?
affects the number ofentries and the quality of created dictionaries.
Thegreater the value of ?, the larger the number oflexical entries, but the smaller the accuracy of theReverseDictionary.The distance between the two LexicalEntrys is thedistance between the two LexicalUnits if the Lexi-calUnits occur in Wordnet ontology; otherwise, it isthe distance between the two Senses.
The distancebetween each phrase pair is the average of the to-tal distances between every word pair in the phrases(Wu and Palmer, 1994).
If the distance between twowords or phrases is 1.00, there is no similarity be-tween these words or phrases, but if they have thesame meaning, the distance is 0.00.We find that aReverseDictionary created usingthe value 0.0 for ?
has the highest accuracy.
This ap-proach significantly increases the number of entriesin the ReverseDictionary.
However, there is an is-sue in this approach.
For instance, the word "tuhbi"in DIS means "crowded", "compact", "dense", or"packed".
Because the distance between the En-glish words "slow" and "dense" in Wordnet is 0.0,this algorithm concludes that "slow" has the mean-ing "tuhbi" also, which is wrong.Algorithm 2 DRwD AlgorithmReverseDictionary := ?for allLexicalEntryi ?
SourceDictionary dofor all Sensej ?
LexicalEntryi dofor all LexicalEntryu ?SourceDictionary dofor all Sensev ?
LexicalEntryu doif distance(<LexicalEntryi.LexicalUnit,Sensej> ,<LexicalEntryu.LexicalUnit,Sensev> ) 6 ?
thenAdd tuple <Sensej ,LexicalEntryu.LexicalUnit>to ReverseDictionaryend ifend forend forend forend for3.3 Direct Reversal with Similarly (DRwS)The DRwD approach computes simply the dis-tance between two senses, but does not look atthe meanings of the senses in any depth.
TheDRwS approach represents a concept in terms ofits Wordnet synset10, synonyms, hyponyms andhypernyms.
This approach is like the DRwDapproach, but instead of computing the distancebetween lexical entries in each pair, we calcu-late the similarity, called simValue.
If the sim-Value of a <LexicalEntryi,LexicalEntryj>, i 6=j pair is equal or larger than ?, we concludethat the LexicalEntryi has the same meaning asLexicalEntryj .To calculate simValue between two phrases, weobtain the ExpansionSet for every word in eachphrase from the WordNet database.
An Expansion-Set of a phrase is a union of synset, and/or synonym,and/or hyponym, and/or hypernym of every word init.
We compare the similarity between the Expan-sionSets.
The value of ?
and the kinds of Expan-sionSets are changed to create different ReverseDic-tionarys.
Based on experiments, we find that the bestvalue of ?
is 0.9, and the best ExpansionSet is theunion of synset, synonyms, hyponyms, and hyper-nyms.
The algorithm for computing the simValue ofentries is shown in Algorithm 3.10Synset is a set of cognitive synonyms.526Algorithm 3 simValue(LexicalEntryi,LexicalEntryj)simWords := ?if LexicalEntryi.LexicalUnit &LexicalEntryj .LexicalUnit have a Word-net lexical ontology thenfor all (LexicalUnitu ?

Evaluations were performed by volunteerswho are fluent in both source and destination lan-guages.
To achieve reliable judgment, we use thesame set of 100 non-stop word ENG words, ran-domly chosen from a list of the most commonwords11.
We pick randomly 50 words from eachcreated ReverseDictionary for evaluation.
Eachvolunteer was requested to evaluate using a 5-pointscale, 5: excellent, 4: good, 3: average, 2: fair, and1: bad.
The average scores of entries in the Reverse-Dictionarys is presented in Figure 1.
The DRwS dic-tionaries are the best in each case.
The percentage ofagreements between raters is in all cases is around70%.The dictionaries we work with frequently haveseveral meanings for a word.
Some of these mean-ings are unusual, rare or very infrequently used.
The11http://www.world-english.org/english500.htmDR algorithm creates entries for the rare or unusualmeanings by direct reversal.
We noticed that ourevaluators do not like such entries in the reverseddictionaries and mark them low.
This results inlower average scores in the DR algorithm compar-ing to averages cores in the DRwS algorithm.
TheDRwS algorithm seems to have removed a numberof such unusual or rare meanings (and entries simi-lar to the rare meanings, recursively) improving theaverage scoreOur proposed approaches do not work well fordictionaries containing an abundance of complexphrases.
The original dictionaries, except the VIE-ENG dictionary, do not contain many long phrasesor complex words.
In Vietnamese, most wordswe find in the dictionary can be considered com-pound words composed of simpler words put to-gether.
However, the component words are sepa-rated by space.
For example, "b?i th?n gi?o" means"idolatry".
The component words are "b?i" mean-ing "bow low"; "th?n" meaning "deity"; and "gi?o"meaning "lance", "spear", "to teach", or "to edu-cate".
The presence of a large number of compoundwords written in this manner causes problems withthe ENG-VIE dictionary.
If we look closely at Fig-ure 1, all language pairs, except ENG-VIE showsubstantial improvement in score when we comparethe DR algorithm with DRwS algorithm.Figure 1: Average entry score in ReverseDictionaryThe DRwD approach significantly increases thenumber of entries, but the accuracy of the createddictionaries is much lower.
The DRwS approach us-ing a union of synset, synonyms, hyponyms, and hy-pernyms of words, and ?
?
0.9 produces the best re-verse dictionaries for each language pair.
The DRwSapproach increases the number of entries in the cre-ated dictionaries compared to the DR algorithm as527shown in Figure 2.Figure 2: Number of lexical entries inReverseDictionarys generated from 100 commonwordsWe also create the entire reverse dictionary forthe AJZ-ENG dictionary.
The total number of en-tries in the ENG-AJZ dictionaries created by us-ing the DR algorithm and DRwS algorithm are4677 and 5941, respectively.
Then, we pick 100random words from the ENG-AJZ created by us-ing the DRwS algorithm for evaluation.
The av-erage score of every entry in this created dictio-nary is 4.07.
Some of the reversal bilingual dictio-naries can be downloaded at http://cs.uccs.edu/ lin-clab/creatingBilingualLexicalResource.html.5 ConclusionWe proposed approaches to create a reverse dic-tionary from an existing bilingual dictionary usingWordnet.
We show that a high precision reverse dic-tionary can be created without using any other inter-mediate dictionaries or languages.
Using the Word-net hierarchy increases the number of entries in thecreated dictionaries.
We perform experiments withseveral resource-poor languages including two thatare in the UNESCO?s list of endangered languages.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank the volunteers evaluatingthe dictionaries we create: Morningkeey Phangcho,Dharamsing Teron, Navanath Saharia, Arnab Phon-glosa, Abhijit Bendale, and Lalit Prithviraj Jain.
