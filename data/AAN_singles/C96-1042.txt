Semant ics  of  Por t ions  and Part i t ive  Nouns  for NLPSalvador ClimentFacultat de Filologia, Sccci6 Lingtifstica GeneralUniversitat de BarcelonaGran Via 58508007 BarcelonaSpaincliment@ goliat.upc.csAbstractThis paper describes a system of representationof nouns denoting portions, segments andrelative quantities of entities, in order toaccount for this case of part-wholerelationship.
The semantics of bothconstructions denoting portions aad nounsused to build them arc discussed and eventuallyformalised in a unification-based formalism(LKB-IA~L) in terms of Pustciovsky's Theoryof Qualia and Jackendoff's ConceptualSemantics.1.
Introduction and MotivationProcesses of inference of meaning concerning part-whole relations can be drawn from a lexicon bearingmeronymic links between words (ef.
\[WAI~881) e.g.component-whole links (hand-arm), member-collection (tree-forest) and so.
The case of portions,segments and relalivc quantities of objects orsubstances ( lices, lumps, buckets, spoon.rids, grains,tops or tips of things) is the exception, since this is arelation which is encoded in the language by means ofconstructions.
Coutrm'y to that which some authorsposit (\[CIIAS8\], \[WIN87\]), it doesn't seem to be aproductive linguistic gencr~disation to set in a lexiconsome part-of link between slice and cake.
In any case,such relalion would exist between cake and slice ofcake -namely, the part-of relalion shouhl standbetween slice and any sliceable thing.Generally speaking, the relation portion may becharactcriscd, semantically, in Ihat lhe whole pre-exists the part and the part retains most of theproperties of lhe whole (\[IRI88\]), and, syntactically,as surfacing in <X of NP> structures, beingpotentially <X> an apparently heterogeneouscollection of words which, henceforlh, billowing\[CO1?
)2\] We will refer to ~ts Partitive Nouns (l'Ns).On Ihc other hand, portions denoted by suchconstructions differ from their wholes in someaspects, basically iudividuation, quantity, process ofbringing about, and shalx:.
Such properties, ince theyare present in <X of N I~ but they were not in <N1)>,are assumed to be carried to the coustruclion by thenoun (<X>).I'll try to show here Ihat it is plausible to give aglob~d account of such heterogeneous set of words,since they bear a range of common and distinctivelinguistic features, and 1'11 try to provide arepresentation feasible for NLP which account bothfor PNs as a general class and for the homogeneoussubclasses which wilhin them could be distinguishedand defined 1.2.
FrameworkWe assume some general familiarity with theframework Wc work within: LKB-I,Pd~ (\[CO1?32\]) asa formalism of computational representation, TheGeueralive Lexicon (\[P\[ 1S95 I) as a theoretical groundlbr the fonmdisatiou of lexical signs, and ConceptualSemantics (\[JAC91\]) for the conceptualisation ofparts and Ixmndaries of entities.LKB-I~RL is an IIPSG-liko formalism based ontyped feature structures (\[CAR92\]) developed withinthe Acquilex Project which makes use of unificationand mechanisms of defaull inheritance.
There are fourbasic levels of representation: ()RTII, CAT, SEM andRQS.
CAT encodes syntax using a eategorialgrammar approach, so there are simple (e.g.
noun: N)and complex (e.g.
adjective: N/N) categories.
It is tobe noticed that in complex categories the activeelement is not a category but a lexical sign, in a waythat selective restrictions may be set at this level byspecifying the semantic type or other features of theselected sign.
SEM encodes logic,'d semantics, RQSis basically equivalent to Pustejovsky's QualiaSlruCltlre (henceforth QUAI,IA).The Theory of Qualia is embedded in that of theGenerative Lexicon and has as a basic aim lo improvecompositionalily by endowing lexical signs with arich internal structure which accounls for differentfacets of human knowledge about lexical-semanticcontent, in a way that, iu many cases, it allows foravoiding listing separate ntries to account for lexic~dpolysemy.
\[PUS95\] posits the lexical entry to beconstituted by four stn~ctures: Fveut, Argument,Lcxical-lnheritauce and QUALIA.
The latter consistsof lout Quales: Agentivc (origin or 'bringing ~d?mt' ofobjects), Telic (purpose and function), Formal (Ihatwhich distinguishes it withiu a larger domain:magnitude, shape, dimcusionality) and Constitutive(relation between au object and its constituents or\[ \]'his work has been dcvelopped for Spanish.Notwithstanding, for case of exposition, 1'11 exemplifythe discussion by means of examples of English -whenpossible.
In any case, for what concerns us here, Spanishand English are, hoth semantically and structurally,strongly comparable -the kernel <PN of NP> comes outin Spanish as a literal translation, <I)N de NP>.243proper parts).\[JAC91\] posits that speakers tmderstand andschematise a range of phenomcua such as mass-cotHltdistinction, plurality, parlilive conslruclions andboundary words in terms of clementmy conceptualfeatures uch as dimension~dity, idealised boundm'iesand internal structure, lie introduces features \[_B\](botmdaries being or not in view or of concern) and\[+I\] (entailment or not about internal structure) forlx)th objects and events as expressing lhe generality ofphenomena of boundedness and plurality -the notionof +I is present in one or another way in \[TAL78\] (cf.\[JAC91\]), \[KR1871 (of.
\[COt?
)2\]) and \[LAK87\]; thatof boundedness in \[LAN91\].
This feature systemcomes out as:+B -I: individu~ds (a pig)/closcd events (,lohn ran tothe store)+B+I: groups (a committee)/boundcd ilerativc events(the lightJlashed until down)-B-I: substances (water)/ unbounded homogeneousprocesses (,lohn shept)-B+I: aggregates (buses, cattle)/unbounded iterativcprocesses (the light flashed continually)Moreover, he posils that boundaries of entities areconceptualised asminimal elaborations (notated e) oftheir ideal topological boundm'ies (i.e.the tip of thetongue is tile portion which conesponds to a minimalelaboration of tile 0-dimensional point which wouldideally be the tongue's tip).3.
Port ions  and Part it ive NounsA portion designs a bounded region within a domain(\[I.AN91\]), hence tile pollion is an individuated entity(even in tile case tile whole be a substance or m,'t,;s).The syntactic effect is that, as pointed out in\[VOS94\], the construction which dcnolcs the portionis syntactically countable.A portion, an individuated (bounded), object has ashape different from thai of the whole.
Thisinformation is contribuled to tile conslruclion by tilePN.
There are PNs which clearly specify shape(ROI)AJA, lunzp) while others underspecify il(fragment).
Ill many cases, PNs, as acljectives do,predicale properties of the portion, specially shape(tile translation of Spanish RODAJA must be lheparaphrase round slice; a lath of anything is salientlyelongated) or size, but also thickness, consislency orothers (as in the c;me of MI);NDRUGO, equivalent oportion (of bread) except for lhe fact that entails thatIhe bread is not fi'esh bul stale).A portion always conveys a measure wilh relationto tile total magnitude of tile whole.
Therefore, nounssuch as bucket, slice, lump or grain are relalivcquantifiers in tile sense of II~AN91\]:a relative quanttfier is so-called because itspecifies a quantity in relation to a reJ?.rencemass; in the de~mlt-case inteJpretation, thisreference mass consists of the maximalinstantiation of the pertinent categoJy (i.e.
itsftdl extension in all conceivable worlds).A portion has been oblained by a diflbrent processlhan the whole: a cake has been obtained by baking it,but a slice o1' cake by cutting it off tile cake.
Themeaning of portions is many times tightly related tosuch agenlive process -if one has obtained 'slices' itnecessarily has been by culling somelhing; there evenexists the verb to slice.
As pointed out in \[PUS95\],knowledge of 'coming into being' is a property ofnominals which has remarkable l inguisticconsequences since it can account for a reduction oflexical polysemy.
I:or instance, tile Spanish phraseIIACER PAN \[to-make bread\] means baking bread,whilst IIACER RI~,BANADAS (DE PAN) \[to-make slices(ofbread)\] means licing (bread).
This way, the verysame verb IIACER shows two radically differentmeanings, which in principle should be listedscpm-alely in the lexicon.
Nevertheless, both can beaccounted for in a single entry which selects theAgentive Role of the complement.More specifically talking about the lexical signswc call PNs, \[IXO77\] shows that lhey correspond tothe classifiers in languages as Tzeltal, MandarinChinese or Viemamese.
In languages wilh classifiers,these words, semantically strongly similar todeterinincrs and quantifiers, have functions ofindividuation and enumeration, making surfacenotions such as sorl of entity, shape or measure.
E.g.the Chinese phrase SAN BEN SIIU is translatable bythree plane-entity book; three whiskies wotfld beconslructed with a mensural classifier, being thetranslation paraphrasablc by three unit/doses whisky.\[IXO77\] makes notice lhal words such as head (ofcattle), sheet (of paper) or lump (of sugar) slaIId forexactly tile same function as classifiers in thoselanguages.
Spec i f ica l ly ,  ltt mp operatessimultaneously as both a mensural (meaningconventional dose) and classal (denoting acerlain typeof aggrcgale) classifier.Some have assumed Ihat PNs select mass nouns(slice of cake, glass of wine), being mass nouns theway in which substances tipically surface in tilelanguage.
Instead, we posit that PNs select both kindsof nouns (count or mass) denoting both kinds ofthings (individuals or subslances), but in any case,crucially, surl'acing as expressing cumulativel'eli3rence.Let's consider t~OI)A.IA I)E I.IMON \[round-sliceof lemon\].
To assume that \].IMON here is massentails assuming that it has undergone a dcrivation~d'grinding' rule which converts countable individuals inmasses.
Nevertheless, a round-slice of lemon isalways a slice of some individual emon, not a specialmeasure of substance which some time in the pastwas 'lemon'.
In any case, if a 'lemon' weren't anindividuated and bounded thing, it couldn't be slicedand tile shape of tile portion wouldn't depend on thatof the whole.
The confusing point is that I,IMON intile example, RODAJA DI: LIMON, surfacesgrammatically assubstances usually do -namely, zero-delermined.
Bul zero-detcrlninalion is not exclusivelya ressource to refer to substances, it is the way ofexpressing cumulative rclcrence.
Both individuals andsubstances may be refered to cumulatively, that is, bcconstrued as an indiffercntiated ~unassment.
Thissurfaces in the language as a zero-determiner plus tile244noun in singular in the case of substances (a glass ofwine), and either in singular or plural in the case ofindividuals (a slice of lemon, a basket of lemons).St), in our poinl of view PNs lipically select thenOllll of the whole as it surfaces when conSll'uingcumulative reference -bul this doesn't compulsorilyenlails neither lhe referent is a substance nor it isrefcred to by lliOallS o f  a lll}lSS llOHll, ht lhe case ofindividuals, referenls till are bounded things, henceboth they can be sliced and the shape of lheir portionsstill can depend on that of the original whole.
Wecan't go further with Ihe issue here but, at last, whatthe discussion above stands for is that humanconceptualisation is c(mside,'ed as Ihe cause, and themass-count distinction, as tb.e surface effect.PNs are not straightforwardly referential, as theypredicate wilh reference Io another entity.

I draught three cupsis needed to do the task.
When appearing in thediscourse, PNs need of further specificalion of thereferent, either via of-compleinenlalion r via ellipsisor anaphora.
Consequetltly, they can not bc tnnary bulrelational predicates in Ihe sense of \[I,AN91 l, thai is,terms which are predicates cmly with reference tosome other entity.A basic linguistic t'ealllre of PNs is lhal they, asrelational predicates, bear seleclional restrictions.Namely, each kind at: PN Call combine with cerlainrelercatial lOtlllS but Call 11o1 combine wilh others,depending on ccrlain fcaltlrcs of tile refcrelllial tlOUXl.These fealures are nlostly l inguistic (type,countabilily, singular or plural) bul also can dependon knowledge of the world (physical slale, etc.).
Wehypothesise that, in general, distinctions belweenclasses of PNs contcerning selectional restrictionsmust be due to linguistic reasons, while furtherspecifications within each class would be due toproperties of the referent, l:,.g., it could be asstlmedthat containers (CUlrV, baskets) select \[-BN items(substances and plurals), and more specifically, cttpsselect liquids and baskets non-liquids.4.

They are individuations of pre-existing parts ofthe whole.
They select \[+II entities, either individualsor substances.
They are not committed to an Agentiveprocess as they may remain attached to the whole.Shape and measure, if considered relevant, are inherentto the portion itself.Boundar ies (BOUND) (the tip of the tongue, thesu(~we of the sea, the top of a box).

They are non-Agentive ither.Their shape is tightly related to Ihat of the whole bt|tone of their dimensions is concepmalised as close tonon-existence (\[JAC9 l\]).
Analogously, they denote aminimal quantity of the whole.Bolh Detached (IY\['CII) (a slice of cake, a slice oflemon) and Model led (MI)LI)) portions (a lump o.fsugar, a sheet ofpcq?er) have been drawn out of thewhole and bear a shape straightforwardly determinedby such Agenlive process.
The meaning of the formerfocus on the Agentive, which is a process of cul orfragmentation el' a \[+B solid.
The latter focus onshape,  wh ich  is o f ten  conceptua l i sedschematically(sheet: a plane; lump, ingot: brick-shaped).
The Agenlivc is a process of inodelling of a\[-B \] substance.Sulnmarising abotlt seleclional restrictions ofthese sorts of PNs, they come out as follows:El,T: select \[+1\] entities (=individuated or substance)(a 'pre-existing-inner-division' of I.

RepresentationTo represent PNs in the LKB we have made someinterpretations for FORMAL aud CONST Quales ofthe QUALIA.We assume that the minimal and most basicFORMAL dist inct ion among entit ies (asconceptualised by speakers) is that of theirbouudedness or not in terms of \[JAC91\].
Therefore,this Quale will be a~signed to one of both types (or acoherent subtype).
Similarly, the miuimalconstitutive distinction to be done is assumed to bethat of entaihnent or not about internal structure ofORTI 1: 'cake'CAT: NPSEM: cake(y)QUALIA: 1" THLIC: eat \]L AGENTIVE: bakethings.
Therefl)re, the CONST role will be assignedto one of both \[_+I\] types (i str true/i str false).In this way, selectional restrictions of PNs will bebasically defined as selection of signs hearingappropriate types lot their FORMAL mid CONSTQuales.As defined ill \[PUS951, SltAPE ~md magnitude(MAGN) are features of the FORMAL Role.
Theirvalues cml be, as discussed above, either absolute orrelative, depending on tile kind of portion.
In the lattercases, SIIAPE and MAGN of portions will be afunction of file corresponding values of file QUALIAof tile whole 2.
This interpretation of the MAGNfeature accounts for the nature of relative quantifiers ofPNs.At their turn, \[+I\] CONSTs be~ the feature ELTSe.g.

(vid.\[\]ACgll, ,also \[CO1?
)21).\[PUS95\] (assuming \[VIK94\] interpretation)attributes the CONST Role the function ofrepresenting the predicative relation Part-Of.Coherently, we assume CONST as encoding arelational predicate R(x,y), being R a typetaxonomically daughter of Part-Of.
In the default case,R will be 'Portion' and in more fine-grained cases, adaughter type of it -e.g.
'Slice'.The Logical Semantics of PNs (SEM) willaccount for their both pm'titive and relational natureby adopting as predicate-,'ugulnent structure that oftheir CONST Role.
For the sake of unification, in theLKB, SEM will be the conjunction of this predicateand the SEM value of the sign deuoting the whole.qhis way (vid.fig.3), that of 'slice of cake' will resultin SLICE(x,y) & CAKE(y) -thus accounting /'or thelogics of John eats a slice of cake as EAT(e,John,x)& SLICE(x,y) & CAKE(y) versus that of John eatscake as EAT(e,John,x) & CAKE(x).2 \[JAC9I\] develops a method to formalise relativeshapes including judgements about dimensionality.246For ease of exposition, the syutax (CAT) of PNsis represented here as the colnplex categoryN/NP_sigu, where the NP_sign is app!'opriatelylex-poriion-sign~.

Concluding RemarksIn lhis paper we presented a system of representationof relational nouns denoting per'lions, segments andrelative quanlities of entities according Io the Theoryof Qualia (\[PUS95\]), which has been parlially re-interpreted and adapted to the insights of ConceptmdSemantics (\[JAC91\]).
This syslem accounts for arange of linguistic facts, being the most remm'kablethe following:1.
Portions m'e mainly encoded in the language bymeans of constructions inslead of by single lexicalunits2.
Portions are both bounded entities aml relativemeasures of the wholes of reference3.
Portions inherit li'om their wholes their purposeor function, but, on the contrary, they showdistinctive shape, mafimlude and origin3 Possibly also \[-B\] collections (groups) (a wagon ofcattle), but, as said before, we're not commited here todiscuss individuation of collections.4.
Partitive Nouns (PNs) select whole-denotingnouns according to the properties of  the referentwholes ,'ks conceptualised by speakersPNs havc been classified according to the semanticregulmities they show, resulting in a system of fivebasic types, which have been represented in aunif ication formalism, LKB-LRL  ( \[COP92\]) ,allowing for composition of PNs (e.g.
slice) and NPs(e.g.
cake) (plus the semanlically void preposition'of; in Spanish, DE) into portion-denoting signs (e.g.slice of cake).Acknowledgements.
