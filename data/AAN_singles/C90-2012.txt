The E-Framework: Emerging ProblemsIan Crookston *Department  of Language & LinguisticsUniversity of EssexColchester UK1 In t roduct ionBeth & Nygaard (1988) have described a for-malism for NLP, the E-Framework (EFW).Two kinds of problem are emerging.
Formally,there are problems with a complete formalisa-tion of certain details of the EFW, but thesewill not be examined in this paper.
Substan-tively, the question arises as to what mileagethere is in this formalism tbr the MT problem.Possibly this question arises about any newNLP formalism, but Raw et al(1988) describethe EFW in an MT context.The EFW arose in reaction to the CAT for-realism for MT (Arnold & des Tombe (1987),Arnold et al(1986)).
This was a sequential s-tratificational formalism in which each level ofrepresentation was policed by its own gram-mar.
The essentials of this process can be di-agrammed:(:)Grammar, Grammar./I tgenerates generatesRepni -t-grammar--* l%epnj*This research has been carried out within theBritish Group of the EUROTRA project, jointly fund-ed by the Conunission of the European Colranunitiesand the United Khlgdom's Department of Trade andIndustry.
I an1 grateful for suggestions and commentsfrom Doug Arnold, Lee Hmnphreya, Louisa Sadler,Andrew Way, and a COLING reviewer.The "t-rules" of the t-grammars were theproblem.In the most compact version of this nota-tion, that of Sharp (1988), the t-rules consistof little more than the annotated subtree oneach end of the mapping.
For instance, in a t,-grammar mapping from a predicate-argumentrepresentation to a surface one, such as mightbe necessary i n the monolingual modules of anMT system, there might be a t-rule like(2)(?,{cat:s}).\[ $GOV: (gov,{cat=v}),$ARGI: argl,$ARG2:arg2 \]=>(s).\[ SARG1,vp .
\ [  $GOV,$ARG2 \]\]This had the attractiveness of explicitnessand clarity, but when it was applied over awider range of phenomena, two problems e-merged.
Firstly, the right-hand side (RttS)of the t-rules repeated the target grammar.In (2), the RtlS repeats the statement of thesurface grammar that the verb and object aredominated by a VP.
Secondly, the set oft-rulesexploded combinatorially.
How this emergeddepended on details of the grammars involved.For example, in the above case, if a second66 1rule were added Ibr passive sentences, then athird and fourth would be needed inserting willon the RHS in future active and passive sen-tences.
\[t is impossible to nmke separate provi-sion for passive and future--there is a passivesimple-tense rule and a passive future rule.
Toadd provision to lower the negation operatorinto its surface adverbial position now requiresnot another ule but another four rules.The general route of the EFW to solvingthese problems is to separate the output of thet-grammar f om the finished representation ithe following way, as described in Bech & Ny-gaard (1988):(3) RepniIt-grammarDI'~SCIIIP'I'OR~Ig r gi l l  lit a r jJ.II,epn~The RtIS of each t-rule specifies a localpart of a special representation called a DE-SCRIPTOR.
This descriptor is then furtherprocessed by the grammar to produce a truerepresentation.
So (2) becomes(4)S: {cat=s}\[ GOV: {role=gov},ARGI: {role=argl},ARG2: {rolo=arg2} \]=>S < ARGI, GOV, ARG2 >The descriptor %treed by the I~ttS is then,crucially, parsed according to the target gram-mar.
All structures defined by the grammarwith that mother at the top and those daugh-ters at the bottom are built: specifically, VPis inserted above the verb and object.
Giventhe extra devices available within grammars,will could be added to the descriptor of a fu-ture tense sentence after t-rule application, sothe four rules covering voice and simple/futuretense mentioned above could be reduced totwo (or one using the unorderedness device de-scribed in Bach & Nygaard (1988)).This is what makes the EFW the EFW.Without the separate ntity called the descrip-tor being parsed to create the representation,the EFW would lose its defining characteris-tic.
So is there any mileage in this insight forMT?It should be noted that what is at issue hereis the special characteristics of the EFW, thosewhich distinguish it from other stratificationalsystems uch as CAT.
The latter have no ana-logue of the EFW's "consolidation" idea andtherefore no analogue of the particular prob-lems discussed here.
The EFW is not in theserespects representative of stratificationM Tformalisms in general.2 Consol idat ion and SimpleTransferWhat target grammars do to the informationspecified oil the RHS in CA'I' can be viewed asa special case of what they do in EFW.
TheEFW can parse, inserting mid-tree nodes andeven extra daughters.
Successful consolidationincludes a judgrnent that the output represen-tation is acceptable.
A special case of this isthe geometrical check, where the parser insertsnothing, and delivers an acceptability verdicton the output.
CAT is limited to performingthe latter special case, which we will refer toas "trivial consolidation".
Its complement is"non-trivial consolidation", and it is this lat-ter that is at issue in this section.There is a well-motivated research pro-gramme with the aim of making the transfer2 67stage of MT as simple as other factors per-mit (van Eynde (1986); Arnold, des Tombe &Jaspaert (1985, section 2.2.3); Leermakers &Kous (1986)).Transfer in the EFW is as in (3).
The needto make transfer simple must be interpreted asa need to make the two representations as sim-ilar as possible, rather than to make the sourcerepresentation and the target descriptor assimilar as possible, for methodological reason-s.
Simple transfer is furthered by researchingtheories and grammars that assign representa-tions that are similar cross-linguistically.
Butdescriptors are not governed by theories andgrammars (other than the bare formal restric-tion that they must be trees).
The only waytheories and grammars get access to descrip-tors in the EFW is by consolidating them intorepresentations.
Since there is no theory of de-scriptors that can be researched in aid of sim-ple transfer, simple transfer must mean simi-larity of representations rather than of repre-sentation and descriptor.Where the simple transfer esearch strate-gy is successful, then source and target repre-sentations are identical except for lexical unit-s. Target descriptor and representation nmsttherefore be identical, at least geometrically.Consolidation is therefore trivial checking, asin CAT.
Where si,uple transfer is possible,parsing of descriptors i  overkill.Where simple transfer is not.
possible, con-solidation would be useful if the descrip-tor resembled the source representation morethan the target representation resembled thesource.There are two possible subcases of such asituation.
Firstly, there could be a general fail-ure of interface theory to assign similar enoughrepresentations.
Suppose for example inter-face theory permitted but did not require VPnodes, and there was a language pair SL andTL such that SL had no VP nodes and TL hadthem.
The TL interface descriptor might thenhave no VP nodes, and consolidation couldadd them to the interface representation.
Inpractice, such language-wide ifferences in in-terface geometry seem to be easy to avoid, butin any case there is a problem of modularity.The output of the bilingual component, thetransfer t-grammar, is non-trivially altered bya monolingual component, he target interfacegrammar.
This makes the modularity of thebilingual component questionable.
In gener-al, it is questionable whether a t-grammar re-quiring non-trivial consolidation is a separatemodule from its target generator, and in trans-fer, this matters, because it is highly desir-able that the numerous bilingual componentsbe modular.Secondly, there can be failures of simpletransfer caused by a peculiarity of a specificsource expression, ff consolidation were usedhere, this would lead to such processes as:@(a)Repn:Descr:Repn:l'ascenseur s'est aba/ss4It-grzm, marJ.the llft wentIgrammarthe lift went down@(b)Repn:Dcscr:Repn:la voiture s'en est all4eIt-grammarthe car wentIgrammarthe car went awayIn such cases, using consolidation to fix upthe output of over-simple t-rules is impossible.Such a strategy is always in danger of destroy-68 3ing the desired translation of some expressionother than the one being fixed.In cases of this latter type t-rules have totake the whole load of the mapping, and theconsolidation stage becomes trivial.So, to recapitulate, where simple transferis possible, (non-trivial) consolidation is nevercalled upon, and where simple transfer is notpossible, it is never useful.3 Conso l idat ion  and  Ambi -gu i tyConsolidation has a peculiar property, thatin certain restricted circumstances it throwsaway disambiguation results, recreating earli-er ambiguities.Suppose there is a sentence S that accordingto grammar G has a set of representationsrt = {r:, r2,...r,}.In the EI"W these are trees, but consider themas labelled bracketings.
Every rl will have a"stretch set"S(r ) = {,' I r c rt r has at least thesame brackets as ri}Suppose then that some ri is consolidated ac-cording to a G ~ that also assigns R as the rep-resentations of S. ri will consolidate ambigu-ously, yielding S(rl).The linguistic claim that this embodies isobviously false, if G and G ~ are similar enoughto yield the same set of representations for S,then each ri of G is in truth equivalent o asingle representation, identical to ri~ in G': itis not equivalent to a set of G ~ representationsthat partly recapitulates the ambiguities thatare already identified.An example is co-ordination.
Consider theco-ordinated NP Bob and Carol and Ted andAlice.
This is 11 ways ambiguous and might berepresentedThe parses(6)(a)as such at English interface level.include{np}\[ {Bob}, {and}, {Carol}, {and},{Ted}, {and}, {Alice} \](6)(b){np} \[ {np}\[ {Bob}, {m~d}, {Carol} \] ,{and},{np}\[ {Ted}, {and}, {Alice} \]\]Plausible t-rules into some target languagewill map these onto descriptors identical to tilesource representation.
Each local tree of thesedescriptors will then be parsed.
It is obviousthat this process will ill the case of (6)(a) willproduce 11 consolidations identical to the orig-inal 11 parses.
(6)(b) will consolidate unam-biguously into something identical to (6)(b).This is because (6)(a) is a case where S(ri) =R, and (6)(b) a case where S(r,) = {r,}.
Lessfiat representations have a smaller stretch setand in this example will consolidate into 3 or1 translations.The claim that (6)(a) is 11 ways ambiguousin any target language is false.
(6)(a) repre-sents one interpretation of the surface string,and the one interpretation has one translationinto any other language.It is obvious that this weakness also affect-s the EFW as a formalism for NLP.
Suppose(6)(a) were a representation at a predicate-argument level, to be mapped to a surface syn-tax level of the sarne language.
The EFW em-bodies a claim that (6)(a) is 11 ways arnbigu-ous on the surface, which is false, just as theclaim that (6)(a) has \]1 translations i false.hi fact, re-parsing descriptors adds anotherdimension to the normal problem of the pars-ing ambiguity of conjoined structures: the firstsurface parse will in general be ambiguous, andeach of its representations will in general map4 69onto many representations at the next level,each of which will in general breed again atthe next level, and so on.

This is plausible: if w in lan-guage A translates into x, y, and z in languageB, it is surely correct o say that w will appearin the set of possible translations in A of eachof x, y and z.Many MT notations, including CAT, fail toembody this observation in a reversible nota-tion, and thus fail to force linguists to imple-ment a symmetrical translation relation.
TheEFW makes it impossible to implement a ful-ly symmetrical relation.
(6)(a) translates into11 things in any target language, but (6)(a)does not appear in the set of possible back-translations of any of those 11 except one, theone identical to (6)(a).5 ConclusionThe descriptor-representation separation andthe parsing of descriptors may not be the rightway to tackle the problems of the CAT MTformalism.
This is a result which increases theurgency of exploring other avenues to tacklingthese problems.
The obvious other avenue isimproving the t-rules themselves, omethingwhich is attempted for example in Arno\]\[d etal (1988),6 ReferencesArnold, D & L des Tombe (1987) "Basic Theoryand Methodology in EUROTRA", in S Nirenbur8,ed, Machine Translation: Theoretical nd Melhod.ological issues, CUP, Cambridge, 114-135Arnold, D, L des Tombe & L Jaspaert (1985) "Eu-rotra Linguistic Specifications Version 3", DG XI-II, CEC, LuxembourgArnold, D, S Krauwer, L des Tombe & L Sadler(1988), "'Relaxed' Compositionality in MachineTranslation", in Second International Conferenceon Theoretical and Methodological Issues in Ma-chine Translation of Natural Languages, CarnegieMellon Univ, PittsburghArnold, D, S Krauwer, M Rosner, L des Tombe& G B Varile (1986) "The iC,AL,T Framework inEU ROTRA: A Theoretically Committed Notationfor MT", in Proceedings of the l l th InternationalConference on Computational Linguistics (COL-ING 86), Association for Computational Linguis-tics, 29%303Arnold, D, & L Sadler (1989) "MiMo: Theoret-ical Aspects of the System", Working Papers inLanguage Processing 6, Dept of Language & Lin-guistics, Univ of EssexBech, A, & A Nygaard (1988) "The E-Framework:A Formalism for Natural Language Proces~ing',in Proceedings of the 12th International Confer.ence on Computational Linguistics (COLING 88),Association for Computational Linguistics, 36-39Isabelle, P (1988), "Reversible Logic Grammarsfor MT", in Second International Conference onTheoretical and Methodological Issues in MachineTranslation of Natural Languages, Carnegie Mel-lon Univ, PittsburghKrauwer, S, & L des Tombe (1984) "Transfer ina Multilingual MT System", in Proceedings of the70 5lOth International Conference on ComputationalLinguistics (COLING 84) , Association for Com-putational Linguistics, 464-467Leermakers, R, & J Rous (1986) "The TranslationMethod of ROSETTA", in Computers and Trans-lation 1, 169-183Raw, A, B Vandecapelle, & F van Eynde (1988)"Eurotra: An Overview", ill b~te~Jace 3, 5-32Sharp, tt (1988), "CAT-2--Implementing a For-m~dism for Multi-Lingual MT", in Second Inter-national Conference on Theoretical and Method-ological Issues in Machine Translation of NaturalLanguages, Carnegie Mellon UniL Pittsburghvan Eynde (1986) "The interface structure level ofrepresentation" i  Multilingua 5, 1~5-i,~6Wanyins; Jin & R F Simmons (1986) "SymmetricRules for Translation of English and Chinese", inComputers and ~'anslation 1, 153-1686 71
