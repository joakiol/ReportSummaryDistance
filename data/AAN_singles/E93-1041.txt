16D-W-2000 Hamburg 50Germanye-maih simmons@bosun2.informatik.uni-hamburg.deAbstractLinguistic access to uncertain quantita-tive knowledge about physical propertiesis provided by dimensional adjectives,e.g.
long-short in the spatial and tempo-ral senses, near-far, fast-slow, etc.
Seman-tic analyses of the dimensional djectivesdiffer on whether the meaning of the dif-ferential comparative (6 cm shorter than)and the equative with factor term (threetimes as long as) is a compositional func-tion of the meanings the difference and fac-tor terms (6 cm and three times) and themeanings of the simple comparative andequative, respectively.
The compositionaltreatment comes at the price of a meaningrepresentation that some authors (\[Pinkal,1990\], \[Klein, 1991\]) find objectionally un-parsimonious.
In this paper, I comparesemantic approaches by investigating thecomplexity of reasoning that they entail;specifically, I show the complexity of con-straint propagation over real-valued inter-vals using the Waltz algorithm in a systemwhere the meaning representations of sen-tences appear as constraints (cf.
\[Davis,1987\]).
It turns out that the compositionalaccount is more complex on this measure.However, I argue that we face a tradeoffrather than a knock-down argument againstcompositionality, since the increased com-plexity of the compositional pproach maybe manageable if certain assumptions aboutthe application domain can be made.TOPIC AREAS: semantics, AI-methods in com-putational linguistics1 IntroductionIn the past decade, the field of knowledge represen-tation (KR) has seen impressive growth of sophis-tication in the representation f uncertain quantita-tive knowledge about physical properties in common-sense reasoning and qualitative physics.
The inputto most of these systems is entered by hand, butsome of them, especially those with commonsensedomains involving spatial and temporal knowledge,are amenable to interaction by means of a naturallanguage interface.
Linguistic access to knowledgeabout properties uch as durations, rates of change,distances, the sizes of the symmetry axes of objects,and so on, is provided by dimensional  adjectives(e.g.
long-short in the spatial and temporal senses,fast-slow, near-far, tall-short).
In this paper, I willinvestigate two aspects of their semantics that havean impact on the quality of a KR system with an NLinterface.
One aspect is the complexity of reason-ing entailed by their semantic interpretations.
As anexample, suppose that we have a text about the in-stallation of new kitchen appliances that contains thefollowing sentences:(1) a.
The refridgerator is about 60 cm wide.b.
The cupboard is about as deep as therefridgerator is wide.c.
The kitchen table is about 5 cm longerthan the cupboard is deep.d.
The oven is about twice as high asthe table is long.We may view the relations expressed by these sen-tences as constraints on the measurements of the ob-ject axes (the width of the fridge, the depth of thecupboard, and so on), which are represented as pa-rameters in a constraint system.
Then constraintpropagation, along with some knowledge about the348sizes that are typical for object categories, shouldallow us to derive the following sentences (amongothers) from (1):(2) a.
The cupboard is about 60 cm deep.b.
The kitchen table is longer thanthe refridgerator is wide.c.
The kitchen table is short(for a kitchen table).d.
The oven is about 70 cm higher thanthe cupboard is deep.e.
The oven is high (for an oven).The inferences from (1) to (2) are rather simple,but reasoning can become very complicated if a largenumber of parameters and constraints must be ac-counted for.
As we will see below, the computationalproperties of this kind of reasoning are dependent onthe types of relations that appear in the knowledgebase.
Thus in the present paper, I investigate thekinds of relations that appear in formal theories ofthe meanings of the following morphosyntactic con-structions of dimensional djectives:(3) a. Pos i t i veThe board is long/short.b.
Comparat iveThe board is (6 cm) longer/shorter thanthe table is wide.c.
Equat iveThe board is (three times) as long asthe table is wide.d.
MeasurementThe board is 50 cm long.This brings us to the second issue: the compo-s i t iona l i ty  of meaning representations proposed forthe sentences in (3).
It is appealing from the view-point of theoretical linguistics to regard each of themorphosyntactic categories (positive, etc.)
as lexicalitems with their own semantics, and to assume thatthe semantics of each sentence in (3) is a composi-tional function of the semantics of the morphosyntac-tic category and the semantics Of the adjective stem.Compositional meaning representations may also becomputationally more advantageous, since they canbe computed very efficiently from syntactic represen-tations (e.g.
in unification-based formalisms).Most formal theories of the meanings of adjectivesattempt o fulfill this criterion of compositionality,but as we will see, they differ on a more far-reachingcriterion: whether the meaning of the differentialcomparative (6 cm shorter than) and the equativewith factor term (three times as long as) is a compo-sitional function of the meanings the difference andfactor terms (6 cm and three times) and the meaningsof the simple comparative and equative, respectively.Although compositionality is generally regarded as avirtue in and of itself, some authors (\[Pinkal, 1990\],\[Klein, 1991\]) have objected to compositional treat-ments of difference and factor terms on the groundsthat they introduce an excessive amount of mathe-matical structure into our linguistic models.In section 3, I will compare semantic representa-tions that do and do not foresee a compositionaltreatment of difference and factor terms by analyzingthe complexity of reasoning that they entail.
In par-ticular, I will investigate the complexity of constraintpropagation in a system where the meaning repre-sentations appear as constraints.
In this paradigm,uncertain quantitative knowledge is accounted forwith real-valued intervals, a popular choice in KRsystems, and constraint propagation is performed bythe Waltz a lgor i thm (which gets its name fromDavid Waltz \[1975\]).
Ernest Davis \[1987\] shows inhis detailed analysis that the Waltz algorithm is oneof the best choices for this task, for reasons that Iwill explain in section 3.1It turns out that the constraint propagation withthe Waltz algorithm under the compositional ap-proach is more complex; thus, we apparently facea tradeoff  between composit ional i ty and com-p lex i ty .
I argue in section 4 that this is indeeda tradeoff, since the non-compositional formation ofmeaning representations may be expensive, and theincreased complexity of the compositional pproachmay be manageable, specially if certain assumptionscan be made about the domain of physical propertiesbeing represented.2 Compositionality in the Semanticsof AdjectivesThere is a vast amount of linguistic data on whicha formal semantics of adjectives can be evaluated,such as the interaction of comparative and equativecomplements with scope-bearing operators: quanti-tiers, logical connectives, modal operators and neg-ative polarity items (e.g.
John is taller than I willever be).
A good theory must also account for thephenomenon of markedness, i.e.
the semantic asym-metry of the antonyms (see \[Lyons, 1977, Sect.
9.1\]).However, I will ignore these issues in order to focuson the matter of compositionality.
Thus I classify theexisting theories of adjective meaning very coarselyas 'compositional' or 'non-compositional'.
Note thatthese labels indicate only whether or not the treat-ment of difference and factor terms is compositional(in other respects, all of the theories mentioned be-low are compositional).To begin with, I presuppose a component of di-mensional designation that determines which prop-erty of an object is described by an adjective, thus1I have only recently become acquainted with EeroHyv5nen's "tolerance propagation" (TP) approach toconstraint propagation over intervals (see \[Hyv6nen,1992\]), which in some circumstances can compute solu-tions that are superior to those of the Waltz algorithm,but at the price of increased complexity.
I comment onthis briefly in section 3.2.349Semant ic  Ana lyses  o f  D imens iona l  Ad jec t ivesFormal interpretations of (3)a. Pos i t ive  amount(length(board)){'q / r--}Nc(length(board))b.

Each class of properties (duration,length, etc.)
is assumed to be associated with a setof degrees  reflecting their magnitudes.
I will sim-ply use the function expression amount(p(x)) to de-note the degree to which entity x exhibits propertyp.
Each set of degrees is assumed to be ordered,and I will use the symbols I- and E for the orderingrelation.
Most authors assume measurement theory(\[Krantz et al, 1971\]) as the axiomatic basis in theformal semantics of linguistic measurement expres-sions (cf.
\[Klein, 1991\]).
For measurement expres-sions such as 3 cm, I simply use a tuple (3, cm) de-noting a degree.
Finally, I follow \[Bierwisch, 1989\]in using the symbol We(a) for the 'norm' expectedfor amount a in context C. This reflects the usualassumption that the positive expresses a relation toa context-dependent standard.
In this paper, I willrestrict my attention to norms that are typical forthe categories named in the sentence, such as tall foran adult Dutchman, slow for a sports car, etc.
2The class of theories that I am referring to as 'non-compositional' include those of \[Cresswell, 1976\],\[Hoeksema, 1983\] and \[Pinkal, 1990\], who proposeformulas similar to those in Table 1 as interpreta-tions of the sentences in (3).
The relation used inplace of the expression {-\] / \[-'} is -1 for the un-marked case (e.g.
tall) and 1- for the marked case(short) .32Clearly, there are many other kinds of norms.
Janis tall may mean tall for his age, taller than I expected,etc.
\[Sapir, 1944\] is still one of the best surveys of thenorms employed in natural language, while Bierwisch hasa more modern analysis.3Of course, Tables 1 and 2 are strong simplifica-I call this approach non-compositional because in-terpretations of the differential comparative (6 cmlonger than) and of the equative with factor term(three times as long as) are not derivable from theformulas hown in lines (b) and (c) (the same can besaid of \[Kamp, 1975\] and \[Klein, 1980\]).The compositional approach is taken by \[Hellan,1981\], \[von Stechow, 1984\] and \[nierwisch, 1989\],whose renderings of (3) are, in simplified form, some-thing like those in Table 2.
The symbol '+ '  is + inthe unmarked case and - in the marked case, and'x '  stands for scalar multiplication.
4In the case of the positive and the ordinary com-parative, the difference term D is existentially quan-tified, as is the factor term n in the case of the ordi-nary equative (with the additional condition that nis greater than or equal to one).
But if the differenceor factor term is realized in the sentence surface, thenits contribution to (b) and (c) in \]?able 2 is embeddedcompositionally.
5tions that fail to reflect important differences betweenthe authors mentioned that are unrelated to the issue ofcompositionaiity.4In measurement theory, the '+' operation is inter-preted as concatenation i the empirical domain, andscalar multiplication is interpreted as repeated concate-nation.
Krantz et at.
\[1971\] show that under proper ax-iomatization, concatenation is homomorphic to additionon the reals.SBierwisch \[1989\] differs from the other authors ad-vocating a compositional pproach in that he does notassume the interpretation of the equative shown in Ta-ble 2.
He points out (p. 85) that this analysis does notaccount for the fact that the equative is norm-related inthe unmarked case: Fritz is as short as Hans presup-poses that Fritz and Hans are short.
Moreover, it is notclear whether this approach can capture the duality of350For the computational nalysis, we will need toclassify the relations hown in Tables 1 and 2, sincethese relations form the input to a knowledge base.But to do so, we must first decide what sorts of en-tities the difference and factor terms denote.
I as-sume that they do not denote constants, since wemay be just as uncertain of their magnitudes as weare of the other magnitudes mentioned in the sen-tences.
Thus it should be possible to treat each ofthe mini-discourses in (4)-(6) in a similar fashion:(4) a.
The board is 90 to 100 cm long.b.
In fact, it is about 95 cm long.
(5) a.
The board is longer than the table is wide.b.
In fact, it is about 6 cm longer.
(6) a.
The board is five to ten times as long asthe table is wide.b.
In fact, it is about seven times as long.The information given in (b) in (4)-(6) can be ac-counted for by simply modifying the terms intro-duced in (a).
Hence, the difference and factor terms,like the 'amount' terms in Tables 1 and 2, denoteuncertain quantities whose magnitude may be con-strained by sets of sentences.
I will refer to theseterms generally as 'parameters'.With this assumption, we can classify the relationsin Tables 1 and 2 as follows:(7) Non-composit ionala.
Ordering relations(Positive, Comparative, Equative)b.
Linear relationsof the form amount(x) + D ~ amount(y)(Differential Comparative)c. Product relationsof the form n x amount(x) ~_ amount(y)(Equative with factor term)(8) Composit ionala.
Linear relations(Positive, Comparative, Differential Comparative)b.
Product relations(Equative with & without factor term)In both approaches, measurements simply serve toidentify the degree to which an object exhibits theproperty in question.Under the compositional pproach, it is possible toassume a single semantic representation in the lex-icon for each adjective stem and each morphosyn-tactic category such that the formulas in Table 2are generated from those lexical entries.
Bierwisch\[1989\], for example, proposes lexical entries of thefollowing form for each dimensional djective:~c~x\[amount(p(x) ) = (v :t: c)\]comparatives and equatives: Fritz is taller than Hansshould be semantically equivalent to Hans is not as tallas Fritz.
However, Bierwisch does assume a representa-tion like this for equatives with realized factor terms.where c is a difference value and v is a comparisonvalue (see \[nierwisch, 1989\] for details).But the elegance of the compositional pproachcomes at the price of lexicM semantic representationsthat include addition and multiplication operators~which is precisely what Pinkal \[1990\] and Klein \[1991\]have criticized: they find the assumption of math-ematical operations as basic constituents of lexicalmeaning uncomfortably strong.
This is one of thereasons why Pinkal proposes eparate lexical entriesfor each morphosyntactic form of an adjective.3 The  Complex i ty  o f  Const ra in tP ropagat ionThe objection to the complexity of the lexical mean-ing representations required for the compositionalapproach appeals to intuitions of parsimony, and isin part a matter of philosophical opinion that maybe difficult to resolve.
Perhaps a decision could bemade on the basis of psycholinguistic experimenta-tion, but I will pose a more utilitarian question inthis section by examining whether the increase inrepresentational complexity in the transition fromTable 1 to Table 2 entails an increase in the com-putational complexity of reasoning for a knowledgebase containing those representations.
The reasoningparadigm to be investigated is constraint propaga-tion (sometimes called constraint satisfaction) overreal-valued intervals.Intervals are intended to account for uncertaintyin quantitative knowledge.
For example, the mea-surement of a parameter at 20 units on some scalewith a possible measurement error of +0.5 units isrepresented as\[19.5, 20.5\], to be interpreted as mean-ing that the unknown measurement value in ques-tion lies somewhere in the set {x119.5 <_ x <_ 20.5}.Additional knowledge about the relations that holdbetween parameters constrains their possible valuesto smaller sets (hence the term 'constraints' for thepropositions in a knowledge base expressing such re-lations).Constraint propagation over intervals has been ap-plied in spatial reasoning (\[McDermott and Davis,1984; Davis, 1986; Brooks, 1981; Simmons, 1992\]),temporal reasoning (e.g.
\[Dean, 1987; Allen andKautz, 1985\]) and in systems of qualitative physics(see \[Weld and deKleer, 1990; Bobrow, 1985\]).
In-tervals have a very obvious weakness in that thehighly precise choice of endpoints can rarely be well-motivated in natural domains uch as these.
In par-ticular, the reasoner may draw very different infer-ences, e.g.
about whether two intervals overlap, ifthe endpoint of some interval is changed by whatseems to be an insignificant amount.
Thus, as Me.-Dermott and Davis\[1984\] note, such a system mustnot only be able to report whether they overlap, butalso "how close" they come to overlapping.If they do come close .
.
.
,  then ...\[the351reasoner\] must decide whether to act on thesuspect information or work to gather more,which is really the only interesting decisionin a case like this.
Eventually, when allpossible information has been gathered, ifthings are still close to the borderline then adecision maker must just use some arbitrarycriterion to make a decision.
We don't seehow anyone can escape this.
\[McDermottand Davis, 1984, p. 114\]A formalism such as fuzzy logic attempts to al-leviate the problem of sharp borderlines by usinginfinitely many intermediate truth values for vaguepredicates.
I happen to have reservations about theadequacy of fuzzy logic for this task 6, but I have cho-sen to study constraint propagation mainly becauseits computational properties are well-researched andare attractive for applications in which the potentialoverprecision of endpoints can be tolerated.
Thus itprovides a sound basis for comparing the semanticanalyses presented in section 2.3.1 Syntax  and  Semant icsIn the following, I briefly review some definitionsfrom \[Davis, 1987, Appendix B\] (with slight modi-fications)SyntaxAssume a set of symbols X = {XI , .

A label  is written \[z_, x+\] with realnumbers 0 < z_ <__ z:~; the symbol oo may also beused for z_ and z+.
A label l ing L for X is afunction from parameters to labels.
If L is under-stood, we write Xi - \[z_, z+\] for L(Xi) = \[z_, z+\].A const ra int  is a formula over parameters in Xin some accepted notation (e.g.
X1 x X2 = )(3 orp _< -X I  + X2 + )(3 <_ q).
A const ra int  systemC = (X, C, L / consists of a set X of parameters, aset C of constraints over X, and a labelling L for X.Semant icsA va luat ion V for X is a function from theparameters to reals.

A labelling L is in-terpreted as restricting the set of possible valua-SThis is not because I object to the notion of truthmeasurement, but rather because I believe that the fuzzylogicians' assumption that the connectives of a logic ofvagueness are truth functional is contradicted by thefacts of human reasoning about vague concepts (as ar-gued by \[Pinkal, to appear\]).
In my opinion, a formalismfor truth measurement would have to be more like prob-ability theory.TI assume the non-negative r als for simplicity, be-cause most of the physical properties mentioned in theexamples have non-negative measurement scales.
Evensome of the exceptions, uch as the common temperaturescales, ate in fact equivalent to a scale of non-negativevalues.tions for X to those V such that for all Xi E X, ifL(XI) = \[x_,z+\], then V(X~) E D(\[x_,z+\]).
Thuswe may view L as denoting a set of valuations on theparameters; we refer to this set as V(L).A constraint C i denotes the largest set of valua-tions that are consistent with the relation expressedby Cj; call this set V(Cj).3.2 Const ra in t  P ropagat ion  A lgor i thmsThe task of a constraint propagation algorithm(CPA) is to tighten the interval abels in an attemptto either (1) find a labelling that is just tight enoughto be consistent with the constraints and initial la-belling, or (2) signal inconsistency.
Constraint prop-agation separates a stage of ass imi lat ion,  duringwhich intervals are tightened, from query ing,  dur-ing which the tightened values are reported.
It isalso possible to infer previously unknown relationsbetween the parameters in the querying stage by in-specting the tightened intervals.
This method of rea-soning may be applied in the linguistic applicationunder study, for example to derive the sentences in(2) above from (1).A CPA is sound if V(Cl)n...VIV(Cn)nV(LI) C_V(L) for every labelling L returned by the algorithm,where {el,...,Ca} is the set of constraints in thesystem and L1 is the initial labelling.
It is completeif V(L) C V(Cl) n ... VI V(Cn) N V(L1) for everyL that it returns.
In other words, the algorithm issound if it does not eliminate any values that areconsistent with the starting state of the system, andcomplete if it returns only such values.As we will see, CPA's for intervals can only becomplete under very restricted circumstances.
ThusDavis defines a weaker form of completeness for theassimilation process.
A CPA is complete  for as-s imi lat ion if every labelling L that it returns as-\[z_,x+\] such that if Vi(Xi) e signs labels Xi - i iD(\[zi.., z~.\]), then l~ ?

Thatis, the label assigned to each parameter accuratelyreflects the range of values it may attain given theconstraints in the system.The Waltz algorithm, which is stated below, is su-perior to many other CPA's in these respects.
It isa sound algorithm, unlike the Monte Carlo methodused by \[Davis, 1986\] and the hill-climber used by\[McDermott and Davis, 1984\].
Moreover, for con-straint systems containing restricted types of con-straints, the Waltz algorithm is complete for assim-ilation and terminates very quickly.
In contrast,Davis reports that the h{ll-climbers used by \[McDer-mott and Davis, 1984\] were prohibitively slow andunreliable.The algorithm is based on an operation called re-f inement ,  defined as follows.

We say that these refinementsare based on Cj.
If the upper and lower boundsof REF INE are computable, then refinement is bydefinition a sound operation.For a constraint system C = (X, {C1,.

The completeness, terminationand time complexity of the algorithm depends onwhat kinds of relations appear as constraints in thesystem, and on the order in which constraints aretaken off the queue.
The results for systems consist-ing exclusively of one of the three kinds of relationsmentioned in (7)-(8) in section 2 are given in Table3, under the assumption that constraints are selectedin FIFO order or a fixed sequential order (other or-derings lead to worse results).
Time complexity ismeasured as the number of iterations through themain loop of the algorithm.
For comparison, Table3 also gives the best known times for complete solu-tions to systems of such relations,In the linguistic application proposed here, theterm S in Table 3 (the sum of the lengths of all ofthe constraints) is proportional to c (the number ofconstraints), since there are no more than three pa-rameters in each constraint.
Hence, O(pS) is O(pc)in this application.Note that Table 3 gives results for linear inequali-ties with unit coefficients (of the form p < )'~ Xi -~ j  Xj < q, where no coefficients differ from 1 or-1).
These are the only kind of linear inequalitiesunder consideration i the linguistic application.
Ingeneral, the Waltz algorithm breaks down if the sys-tem contains more complex relations, such as linearinequalities with arbitrary coefficients or product re-lations, since it may go into infinite loops even if thestarting state of the system was consistent.
Con-sider, for example, the set of constraints {nl x X =Y, n2 x X = Y} with the starting labels nl - \[1; 1\],n2 --" \[2, 21, X - \[0,100\] and Y - \[0,100\].
The sys-tem continually bisects the upper bounds of X and Ywithout ever being able to reach the solution, whichSHyvSnen's \[HyvSnen, 1992\] tolerance propagation(TP) approach is similar to the Waltz algorithm, butit uses a queue of solution functions from interval arith-metic \[Alefeld and Herzberger, 1983\] rather than refine-ment operations.
The "global TP" method computescomplete solutions, but at the price of increased com-plexity.
In the "local" mode, tolerance propagation isvery similar to the Waltz algorithm in its computationalproperties.353is X - \[0, 0\] and Y -" \[0, 0\].
Similarly, if the startinglabels are X - \[1, ~\ ]  and Y - \[1, c~\], then the thelower bounds are continually doubled without reach-ing the solution X - leo, ~\ ]  and Y - \[oo, oo\].However, it is shown in \[Simmons, 1993\] that thishappens only if the solution contains labels of thiskind.
Define a label as admiss ib le  if it is not equalto \[0, 0\] or \[0% oo\]; otherwise, it is inadmissible.
Alabelling L is admissible if it only assigns admissiblelabels; otherwise, L is inadmissible.
Then it can beshown that if a system of product constraints i con-sistent and its solution is admissible, then the Waltzalgorithm terminates in O(pS) time.
Moreover, ifthe system is inconsistent, he algorithm will findthe inconsistency in finite but arbitrarily long time.Unfortunately, the proof is too long to include in thepresent paper, but a brief outline of the argument isgiven in the Appendix.Systems with linear inequalities or product con-straints are liable to enter infinite or very long loopsif the starting state is inconsistent (or if the solutionis inadmissible in the case of products).
Davis \[1987,p.
305-306\] suggests a strong heuristic for detectingand terminating such long loops: stop if we have beenthrough the queue p times (for p parameters).
He isnot clear on what he means by "having been throughthe queue z times", but I interpret him as meaningthat we should stop if any constraint has been takenoff the queue more often than p times.
The rationaleis the observation that in practice, most systems thatdo terminate normally seem to do so before this con-dition is fulfilled, much sooner than the worst-casetime predicted by the complexity analysis.
The reli-ability of such a heuristic is one of the topics of thenext subsection.3.3 Empirical TestingThe analytic results given in the previous ubsectionhave left two important questions open:?
What is the complexity of constraint propaga-tion if the system contains different kinds of con-straints??
How reliable is Davis' heuristic for terminatinginfinite (or very long) loops?The first question lends itself to an analytic an-swer, but the results are not known at present.
Butwe can seek empirical evidence by running the al-gorithm on mixed systems of constraints to see ifthe time to termination is significantlY greater thanthe complexity expected for systems containing justthe most complex type of relation in the system.
Ifthis does not happen for a number of representa-tive systems, we may conjecture that the combina-tion of constraints has not made the problem morecomplex.
The second question can only be answeredempirically, by testing whether the heuristic tendsto terminate the algorithm too soon (i.e.
whetherit terminates refinement of systems that might haveterminated normally in a short time).Empirical investigations of these questions are re-ported in \[Simmons, 1993\], and described brieflyhere.
To investigate the first question, the algorithmwas run on a number of large, consistent constraintsystems with admissible solutions in which the threetypes of constraints hown in Table 3 appeared inapproximately equal numbers.
On each run, the con-straints in the initial queue were permuted randomlyto suppress the possible effects of ordering.
None ofthese runs required more time to termination thanis predicted by the O(pS) result for systems con-taining just unit linear inequalities or just productconstraints.To investigate the second question, I attemptedto build consistent constraint systems with admissi-ble solutions that are terminated by Davis' heuris-tic sooner than they would have been normally.
Itturns out that the algorithm runs to completion onalmost all systems that were tested long before anyconstraint is taken off the queue p times, althoughthere are systems for which refinement is terminatedtoo soon on this heuristic.
If the limit is increasedby a constant factor, e.g.
if assimilation is stoppedafter some constraint is processed 2p times, then therisk of early termination is greatly reduced.In all, the empirical results on the open questionsmentioned above have been encouraging.
It is anadmitted weakness of these tests, however, that theywere performed on systems built by hand, not onconstraint systems that occur "naturally" as part ofan NL interface to a KR system.4 Conc lus ionsThe results of the previous section yield Tables 4and 5 as the complexity of reasoning with the Waltzalgorithm under the non-compositional and compo-sitional approaches, respectively.
These results de-pend in part on the fact that there is a maximumnumber of parameters in each constraint in the lin-guistic application.
Measurements are modelled aspredicate constraints, i.e.
they simply impose inter-val bounds on some parameter.
Intervals are alsoassumed to model the range of measurement valuesfor the physical property that is typical for membersof a category (e.g.
the typical width of refridgera-tots), thus accounting for the norm used in the in-terpretation of positives.
An important property ofsuch "norm intervals" is that they may not be re-fined, at least not too much.
This may be achievedby adding constraints imposing absolute upper andlower bounds on their ranges (cf.
\[Simmons, 1992\]).Although the worst-case time complexity in allcases turns out to be the same, the compositionalapproach is more complex for two reasons.
First,the system is prone to enter infinite loops under thecompositional pproach if the starting state is incon-sistent, or if the solution is inadmissible.
Consistencycannot generally be guaranteed in the linguistic ap-plication under consideration, since the sentences in354Non-compositionalI Morphosyntactic RelationCategory IIMeasurementsPositiveComparativeEquativeDifferentialcomparativeEquative w/factor termPredicateOrderOrderOrderLinearInequalityProductTime ComplexitytrivialOIpc}pc OIpc O~O(pe),o(pc)tCompletenessCompleteAssimilationAssimilationAssimilationIncompleteIncompleteTable 4: Complexity of reasoning under the non-compositional approachI Morphosyntactic Category IIMeasurementsPositiveComparativeEquativeDifferentialcomparativeEquative w/factor termCompositionalRelationPredicateLinear InequalityLinear Inequality.ProductLinearInequalityProductTime ComplexitytrivialO(pc),O(pc),O(pc)tO(pc),O(pc) tCompletenessCompleteIncompleteIncompleteIncompleteIncompleteIncompleteTable 5: Complexity of reasoning under the compositional pproachp = number of parameters, c = number of constraints?

Second, reasoning underthe compositional pproach is incomplete in all butthe trivial case of measurements, whereas the non-compositional pproach guarantees at least assimi-lation completeness for a subset of the parametersin the system.
This means that under the compo-sitional approach, the reasoner does not refine someintervals as tightly as it could have under the non-compositional pproach.These results may be taken as grounds for reject-ing the compositional pproach to the semantics ofdimensional adjectives in the design of an NL in-terface to a KR system for quantitative knowledge.However, I do not believe that the compositional p-proach is contraindicated for all conceivable systems.In addition to the general theoretical appeal of com-positional semantics, the compositional formationof meaning representations may be computationallymore attractive in some cases (e.g.
in unification-based formalisms).
Thus if the non-compositionalformation of semantic representations turns out tobe too expensive, it may defeat the computationaladvantage gained in the reasoning process.This is especially true if the weaknesses ofthe com-positional approach do not turn out to be highlyrelevant in the specific application.
For example, ifthe domain of physical properties being representedis such that a set of constraints requiring some pa-rameter to be set to \[0, 0\] or \[c~, co\] is unlikely tobe encountered, and hence the solution is likely tobe admissible, then the risk of infinite loops is re-duced.
Moreover, if Davis' heuristic for terminatinginfinite loops turns out to be reliable (which mightbe determinable by experimentation within the spe-cific application), then inconsistencies need not bevery damaging.The incompleteness of reasoning under the com-positional approach is unacceptable for an applica-tion if it is crucial that the inferred intervals con-tain precisely those values that are warranted by theconstraints and the initial labelling.
If a superset ofthose values can be accepted, however, then the com-positional approach can be taken.
Both approachessuffer a lack of what Davis calls query complete-ness: if the value of a term T is to be determinedduring the querying stage (i.e.
after assimilation),355the system may return a superset of the values for Tthat are warranted by the constraints.Thus an engineer building an NL interface to asystem for reasoning about uncertain quantitativeknowledge of physical properties must make a num-ber of design decisions:?
How important are difference and factor termsin the linguistic material to be processed?If difference and factor terms are so marginalthat they may not occur at all, then the non-compositional approach is probably the betterchoice, due to its guarantee of termination and as-similation completeness.?
Does the compositional generation of lexical se-mantic representations have a significant advan-tage (computational or otherwise) over the non-compositional pproach??
Is it possible or likely for the measurement ofsome physical property to be exactly zero?While there is probably no natural application inwhich the magnitude of some property can be in-finitely large, there are different philosophies aboutthe treatment of zero.
In a system of temporal rea-soning, for example, saying that some event has zeroduration may be a way of saying that the event doesnot exist.
But another policy might be to insist thatno physical property is represented if it is not exhib-ited to a positive degree.
If this assumption can bemade, then the intervals \[0, 0\] and \[c?, oo\] are trulyinadmissible, and hence one weakness of the compo-sitional approach is diminished.?
Is it important that the precise range of permis-sible measurement values be inferred for eachparameter, or can a superset of those values beuseful?If a superset of the possible values is acceptable, thenthe compositional pproach can be chosen.
Other-wise, the non-compositional approach must be taken.By weighing the various answers to these ques-tions, an engineer can stake out a position on thetradeoff and design a system with the power and ef-ficiency most appropriate to his or her needs.AcknowledgementsThanks to Carola Eschenbach, Claudia Maienborn,Andrea Schopp, Heike Tappe and the referees fortheir comments on earlier versions of this paper.Thanks also to Longin Latecki for discussions aboutconstraint propagation, and to Christopher Habel forencouraging me to pursue this work.Append ixIn the following, the proof of the following theorem(from \[Simmons, 1993\]) is briefly outlined:Theorem 1 If a system of product constraints isconsistent and its solution is admissible, then theWaltz algorithm brings it to quiesenee in time O(pS).Recall that a product constraint is of the form~i Xi = Y, and that a labelling is admissible if itdoes not assign \[0, 0\] or \[c~, oo\] to any parameter.First we need some terminology defined in \[Davis,1987, Appendix B\] (recall the definition of refine-ment operators in section 3.2 above).For a refinement operator R, let OUT(R) be thebound affected by R, and let ARGS(R) be the setof bounds other than OUT(R) that enter into thecomputation of OUT(R).
Given a labelling L, R isact ive  on L if it changes L, i.e.
if L ~ R(L).A series of refinement operators T~ = (R I , .
.
.
,  Rm)is active if each refinement in T~ is active.
We saythat Ri is an immediate  predecessor  of Rj in 7~if i < j, OUT(Ri) E ARGS(Rj), and for all k suchthat i < k < j, OUT(Rk) # OUT(I~).
In otherwords, some argument of P~ has been set most re-cently in the series by Rj.
We say that Ri dependson Rj if either i = j or Ri depends on Rk and Rjis an immediate predecessor f Rk.
Thus the depen-dence relation is the transitive and reflexive closureof the immediate precedence relation.
We say thatRi depends on bound B if for some Rj, Ri dependson Rj and B E ARGS(Rj).The series of refinements T~ = (R1, .
.
.
,  R~) is self-dependent  if Rn depends on OUT(Rn), its own out-put bound.
In other words, a series is self-dependentif the last bound affected by the series is also an argu-ment to the first refinement in a chain of refinementsin the precedence relation, as illustrated below.
(OUT( Rn ~OUT( R, }~-~OUT( R2 }.

~Davis shows that such self-dependencies are po-tential infinite loops:Theorem 2 Any infinite sequence of active refine-ments contains an active, self.dependent subsequence(\[Davis, 1987, Lemma B.15\]}.In \[Simmons, 1993\], it is shown that if any self-dependent sequence 7~ is active on the labelling of asystem of product constraints, then a certain sub-sequence T~' of ~ will be active infinitely manytimes.
Moreover, on the rn-th execution of each re-finement Ri in ~ ' ,  there is a term 7~n/, where eachT/m > T/m-1 > 1, such that OUT(Ri) is multipliedby:(T~) -1, if OUT(e,) is an upper boundsty-, if OUT(R~) is a lower boundIt follows that upper bounds are refined so as tobecome arbitrarily small (asymptotically approach-ing zero), and that lower bounds become arbitrarilylarge, up to infinity.Thus if there is any constraint Ci in the systemthat imposes a lowest value greater than zero on an356upper bound that is affected by a refinement oper-ator in ~',  that bound will be refined often enoughuntil it becomes inconsistent with Ci.
Similarly, ifany constraint Cu imposes a largest finite value ona lower bound that is affected by a refinement in7U, then that bound will be refined until it becomesinconsistent with Cu.
In both cases, the system isinconsistent.If there are no such constraints, then it is consis-tent for upper bounds affected by T~' to be asymp-totically close to zero and for lower bounds affectedby T~' to be arbitrarily large.
This can only be con-sistent if, in the case of upper bounds, the solutionassigns \[0, 0\] to the parameter in question, and in thecase of lower bounds, the solution assigns \[co, oo\] toits parameter.
Hence, the solution is inadmissible.But according to Davis' result (Theorem 2), in-finite loops must contain an active, self-dependentsubsequence such as 7~.
It follows that if a systemof product constraints i consistent and its solutionis admissible, then the Waltz algorithm finds its so-lution in finite time.
The time complexity result is astraightforward extension of Davis' analysis of unitlinear inequalities (see \[Simmons, 1993\]).References\[Alefeld and Herzberger, 1983\]G. Alefeld, J.Herzberger.
