Good Spelling of Vietnamese Texts,one aspect of computational linguistics in VietnamPHAN Huy KhanhDepartment of Information TechnologyDaNang University17, Le Duan Street, DaNang City, Vietnamphanhuykhanh@dng.vnn.vnAbstractThere are many challenging problems forVietnamese language processing.
It will be along time before these challenges are met.
Evensome apparently simple problems such asspelling correction are quite difficult and havenot been approached systematically yet.
In thispaper, we will discuss one aspect of this type ofwork: designing the so-called Vietools to detectand correct spelling of Vietnamese texts byusing a spelling database based on TELEXcode.
Vietools is also extended to serve manypurposes in Vietnamese language processing.IntroductionFor the past two decades computationallinguistics (CL) has progressed substantially inVietnam, mainly in these basic aspects: dataacquisition from the keyboard, encoding, andrestitution through an output device forVietnamese diacritic characters, updates on thefonts in Microsoft DOS/Windows,standardization for Vietnamese (James Do, NgoThanh Nhan), automatic translation of Englishdocuments into Vietnamese and vice versa (PhanThi Tuoi, Dinh Dien), recognition ofhandwriting (Hoang Kiem, Nguyen VanKhuong), speech processing (Nguyen ThanhPhuc, Quach Tuan Ngoc), building bilingualdictionaries such as English-Vietnamese and V-E,  French-Vietnamese and V-F dictionaries(Lac Viet), archives of old Sino-Vietnamesedocuments (Ngo Trung Viet, Cong Tam), etc.Some of these works have been presented inInformatics and IT workshops organized inVietnam.
These efforts are modest and do not yetshow our full potential.
There are many reasonsfor this weakness.
The major reasons thatthe different efforts are quite isolated andthere is not enough coordination.
Somecoordinated workshops held from time totime would be very helpful.At the IT Dept.
DaNang University we arebuilding a lexical database based on TELEXcode for accomplishing the following tasks:- Converting Vietnamese texts from anyfont to any other font.- Putting texts in alphabetical orderindependently of the font in use.- Looking up words up in the monolingualand / or multilingual dictionary.- Building specialized monolingualdictionaries.At present, we are taking part in the GETA,CLIPS, IMAG, France, in the FEV project: fora multilingual dictionary: French-Vietnamesevia English.In fact, inputting Vietnamese texts stillencounters many problems, not yet solvedproperly.
The most common mistakes indetecting and correcting spelling errors are:- wrong intonation or misspelling,- not following spelling specialization, notusing syllables systematically in the sametexts, etc.Winword, a commercial text processor, is notable to detect and correct spelling mistakes.The program designed by Ngo Thanh Nhan(without an associated spelling dictionary)and other software packages for Vietnamesestill do not offer adequate solutions.We propose here a general solution forbuilding the so-called Vietools for detectingand correcting spelling errors.
Vietools isdesigned for office application such asWinword, Excel, Acess, PowerPoint, etc.
inMicrosoft Windows.
Vietools has also beenextended for converting and rearrangingVietnamese words in the dictionaries andconsulting the Vietnamese dictionaries,including multilingual dictionaries.1 Building spelling databaseIn the spelling dictionary by Hoang Phe(1995), there are 6760 syllables in the writingsystem (6616 syllables in the phonologysystem) to compose single words or complexwords.
Each syllable has two parts: initialconsonant (optional) and rhyme pattern(including rhyme and tone).
Altogether, thereare 27 initial consonants, and 1160 rhymepatterns (including 6 tones).Based on Vietnamese syllable structure, thespelling database is built in a tabular form.
Eachelement of the table helps to check thecorrection of a syllable based on the columnposition of initial consonants and the rowposition of rhyme patterns, for example, thesyllable lamf (work) in the TELEX form, iscomposed of the initial consonant l andrhyme pattern am with by low falling tone(or grave accent) f. Each element of the tablecan be understood as:- syllables used in Vietnamese.- elements between tone sign positions (ono: oja or on a: oaj), pronunciation ordialect with spelling (z is equivalent to dor gi, y is equivalent to i...) andborrowings such as karaoke, photocopy,fax...- Sino-Vietnamese word: coongj (addition)?
congj, quoocs (country) ?
nuwowcs...- being unable to form syllables: quts,quoon, coan , cuee...Techniques have been developed torecognize the compound words from twosyllables, such as baor damr or damr baor(guarantee), chung chung (vague), etc., fromthree syllables, such as howpj tacs xax(cooperative), etc., from four syllables, suchas coong awn vieecj lamf (work, job), etc.2       Designing VietoolsThe error detecting program reads one syllable ata time from the text.
The syllable is divided intoan initial consonant and a rhyme pattern, payingattention to solving initial consonants such as: gicontaining vowel i; the consonant qu has vowel u,but it is easy to separate it from the syllable for itdoes not have the consonant q; the othercombined initial consonants have the length of 2,or 3.
The error-correcting unit checks theconformity of initial consonants (if present) andthe rhyme pattern.3 Code convertingAt present, there are many Vietnamese fontsbuilt on different codes (different in numberof bytes used: 1 byte or 2 bytes, order oftones, letter arrangements, etc.).
Becausethere has not been a unified code forVietnamese text, we selected a pivot codeand TELEX code.
There are many codes toconvert from such as IBM-CP01129,Microsoft-CP1258, VISCII, VietKey,VietWare, VNI, TCVN3, Unicode, etc.Vietools works on syllables converted toTELEX.
Vietools analyses syllables todetect initial consonants and rhyme patternin TELEX code.ConclusionThe main advantage of our method is thatthe tool operates independently of theVietnamese font used.
The design ofVietools is open: one can add new functionssuch as text or data conversion Spelling database structure design helps building multi-functional dictionaries, which are essentialfor natural language processing.AcknowledgementsMy thanks go to my students for therealization of Vietools and my colleagues fortheir opinions.
