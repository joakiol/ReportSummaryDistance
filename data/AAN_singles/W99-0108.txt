eduAbstractIn order to produce coherent text.
natural lan-guage generation systems must have the abilityto generate pronouns in the appropriate places.In the past, pronoun usage was primarily inves-tigated with respect to the accessibility of ref-erents.
We.argue that generating appropriatereferring expressions requires looking at fac-tors beyond accessibility.
Also important aresentence boundaries, distance from last men-tion, discourse structure and ambiguity.
Wepresent an algorithm for generating appropri-ate anaphoric expressions which takes the tent+poral structure of texts and knowledge aboutambiguous contexts into account.
We back upour hypotheses with some empirical results in-dicating that our algorithm chooses the rightreferring expression i 85% of the cases.1 IntroductionAnaphoric expressions are an important component togenerating coherent discourses.
While there has beensome work on generating appmwiate refening expres-sions, little attention has been given to the problem ofwhen a pronoun should be used to ref= to an object.
Inmost instances the assumption has been that a pronounshould be generated when referring to a discourse ntitythat is highly prominent (accessible).
However, a studyof naturally occurring texts reveals that factors beyondaccessibility must be ~g*n into account in order to ex-plain the patterns of pronoun use found.Other researchers have indicated that fuller descrip-tions tend to bbe found at the beginning of discourse seg-ments (Grosz & Sidaer, 1986; Reichman, 1985), evenwhen the object being referred to is extzemely prominentin the preceding sentence.
There may be two reasons forthis: (1) it could be that the item is not accessible sincethe "focus space" associated with the previous sentenceis '*popped" at the boundary (and perhaps an older fo-cus space, with respect to which accessibility should bejudged, is restored in its place (Passonneau.
1996)), (2)the use of a fuller definite description is actually mark-ing the discourse segment boundary.
If (2) is the case,because other methods for marking boundaries are alsopossible (and the writer need not use multiple markings),this may help explain why the correlation between dis-course segment boundaries and fuller referring expres-sions is not perfecLSupposing that discourse, segments are an importantfactor in choosing anaphoric expressions, inorder to takeadvantage of them we must have a clear definition-Ofwhat a discourse segment is.
For generation, the dis-course segment boundary must be part o f  the input toa sentence generator (which, we assume, is responsiblefor making the referring expression choice).
To evaluateproposals for generating referring expressions, the dis-course segment boundary must also be recognizable.While discourse segment boundaries may be impor-tant, note that fuller noun phrases are sometimes usedwhen there is no discourse segment boundary (underany reasonable definition of boundary).
This may oc-cur when the referent is not accessible because the near-est antecedent is too far away or because it is confusablewith another eferent.
We attempt o explain such in-stances as well.In order to determine the circuntctances under whichto choose a pronoun versus a definite descripfiont0 ourtack has been to study naturally occurring examples andto try to hypothesize rules that explain the referenceforms in those examples.
To date we have concentratedour study on New York Times news articles.
We hopeto generalize some of our findings to other types of textgenres as well.Consider the following passage from the first severallines of one.of the stories we analyzed:EaJmple 1:When Kenneth L. Curtis was wheeledinto court nine years ago, mute, dull-eyed andcrippled, it seemed clear to nearly everyone in-volved that it would be pointless to put himon trial for the murder of his former girlfriend,'We use the term definite description to mean either a defi-nite noun phrase or a name..63Donna Kalson, and the wounding of her com-panion.It had beenayear since Mr. Curtis hadslammed his pickup truck into them, breakingtheir legs.
He then shot them both and, finally,fired a bullet into his own brain.
Mr. Curtisfingered in a coma for months, then awoke to aworld of paralysis, pain and mental confusionfrom which psychiatric experts said he wouldnever emerge.One expert calculated his I.Q.
at 62 .....For convenience, we have indicated all references tothe main character inbold.A surprising thing to note about his passage is that notall of the anaphoric references toMr.
Curtis are pronounseven though e is arguably the focus of every sentenceincluded.
Some previous work on pronoun generationwould predict that a pronoun should be used if the sameitem remains in focus.
Thus it appears that somethingother than a straightforward application of focusing orother pronoun resolution algorithms i necessary.?
A second thing to note about his passage is that thesentences are generally ong and complex and often con-rain several references to the same character.
Thesetypes of sentences are very different from those thathave been considered by any generation system that hasrules for generating pronouns.
In addition, it is not clearhow most focusing or pronoun interpretation algorithmswould handle them.One hypothesis that might be made is that the under-lying structure of the text might affect pronoun gener-ation.
Care must be taken in choosing such a structure.The chosen structure must (1).explain the patterns of pro-nouns found in naturally occurring text' and (2) be basedon information available to a sentence generation system.Notice that constructs such as paragraph breaks meet nei-ther of these criteria.In this work we hypothesize that discourse structure(segmentation) is indeed vital in the decision of whetheror not to generate a pronoun.
However, we argue thata single definition of disburse segment is not sufficientto explain the patterns of pronoun use found, and seeka more general notion.
Here, to distingni~h o~ notionfrom other notions of discmuse segmentation found inthe literature (e.g., Reidmum (1985) or Grosz & Sidner(1986)), we use the term discomae thread to capture thestructuring notion to whidz we refer.
We propose that adiscourse generally contains multiple threads which runthrough the discourse and can serve to structure the dis-course.
In general, a single thread is evident at a par-ticular point in the discourse, but this thread may be re-placed by another thread and then picked up again at an-other point in the discourse (cf.
Ros6 et al (1995)).
The"threading device" used to structure will be different fordifferent kinds ofdisc0urses.
For instance, in the kinds ofdiscourses studied in Grosz & Sidner (1986) the thread-ing device may be the intentional structures (and each oftheir discourse segments would constitute a thread of thediscourse), in the discourses that we studied (New YorkTimes a~cles), threads defined in terms of the time ref-erenced in a clause appeared to be quite prominent.In this paper we present our preliminary work in un-covering factors that affect pronoun generation deci-sions.
Our work so far has led us to hypothesize s veralfactors including:Sentence Boundaries - pronouns appear to be the pre-ferred referring form for subsequent reference to anitem within the same sentence.Distance from Last Mention - when the last mention ?of an item is several sentences back in the text' adefinite description ispreferred.Discourse Structure in terms of multiple threads -when the previous reference to an item is in thesame thread as the current reference, a pronoun ispreferred.
A definite description is preferred whenthe threads are differenCAmbiguity - potential mbiguity must be taken into ac-count when choosing an anaphoric expression inthat a pronoun should only be generated if it canbe resolved correctly.In the next section we discuss previous research onpronoun generation.
"finis is followed by a discussion ofsome anaphoric expressions that do not require consid-ering discourse structure to generation.
This is followedby an introduction of time as a slructuring device whichaffects pronoun generation.
Next we investigate ambigu-ous anapboric references.
We follow this with an algo-rithm which decides when to use a pronoun versus adef-inite description when referring to some discourse ntity.After this, we report on empirical results of the appli-cation of our algorithm to a corpus of New York Tunesarticles.
Finally, we provide some/~'i'~ted work, futureresearch, and conclusions.2 Previous Work  on  Pronoun Generat ionFew researchers have given serious consideration totheproblem of pronoun generation.
The most common fac-tot considered has been the accessibility of the refer-eaL I f  the referent is sufficiently prominent in theceding text, a pronoun is usecL Some early generationwork (e.g., McDonald (1980), McKeown (1983), McKe-own (1985), Appelt (1981)) used a simple mleto imple-ment his idea based on focus (Sidner, 1979) that roughlystated that if the current sentence isabout he same thingthat the previous entence was about, use a pronoun torefer to that thing.
As was pointed out above, this ruledoes not provide a very good match with the referringexpressions in our corpus.Dale (1992)also ~ the generation ofpronounsin the context of work on generating referring expres-sions (Appelt' 1985; Reiter, 1990).
Dale specified an al-gorithm that essentially generated the smallest refen'ingexpression that distinguished the object in question from640@@0@0@0000@00@@@@000@0@@@000@0@@00@@@0@@OOOO0@@OOOOO@OOOO@OOOOOO@@OO@OOO@O@@@@@O@O?
nil others in the context) He generated a pronoun (orellipsis) if one were adequate and if the object being re-ferred to was the center of the last utterance (where thenotion of center was defined in a domain dependent fash-ion).
As an example of the kinds of texts he generatedconsider: "Soak the butterbeaus.
Drain and rinse them.
"Such an account of pronoun generation, based on cen-ter constancy, appears to work quite well in the domainDale considered.
However, as pointed out in Example 1,it does not seem to explain the patterns found in the textswe analyzed.The centering model (Orosz et al, 1995) itself makespredictions about pronoun generation only in a specificinstance - that where Rule 1 is appficeble.
Centering'sRule 1 states that if any element of the previous utter-ance's forward looking center list is realized in the cur-rent utterance as a pronoun, then the backward lookingcenter must be realized as a pronoun as well (Grosz et al,1995.
p.214).
Notice that the Mr. Curtis at the beginningof the second sentence inExample I is an apparent vio-lation of this rule.
But, more generally, we must have atheory that is able to handle all cases of pronoun use.A pronoun interpretation algorithm based on centeringwhich relied on centering transition preferences was de-veloped in Brennan et aL (1987)~ Using transition pref-erences in a pronoun generation rule would cover morecases of pronoun use than is covered by Rule 1, but theapplication of such transition preferences also proved un-helpful in explaining pronoun patterns in our corpus.Reichman (1985) and Grosz & Sidner (1986) indi-cate that discourse segmentation has an effect on the lin-guistic realization of referring expressions.
While thisis intuitively appealing, it is unclear how to apply thisto the generation problem (in part because it is unclearhow to define discourse segments o a generation sys-tem).
Passonneau (1996) argues for the use of the prin-ciples of information adequacy and economy.
Her algo-rithm takes discourse segmentation into account throughthe use of focus spaces which are associated with dis-course segments.
Thus, Passonneau explains that a fullerdescription might be used at a boundary bec__~_use theset of accesu'ble objects changes at discourse segmentboundaries (though she combines this consideration withcentering theory which may override the decisions dueto segment boundaries).
While Passonneau's algorithmseems quite appealing, notice that it provides no explana-tion of how a discourse segment should be defined.
Theevaluation that she provided used the discourse segmentsprovided by aset of naive subjects who indicated is-course segment boundaries in her texts.
Without suchboundaries provided, it is impossible to apply her algo-ritlun.
In some sense, the work presented here is con-sistent with Passonneau's theory..What we attempt toadd is a genre-dependent definition of discourse segment(thread) which is well-defined and can be derived from2This algorithm was later evised in Dale & Reiter (1995) mmore adequately reflect human-generated referring expressionsand to be more computationally tractable.input that any sentence generator must have in order togenerate a sentence.
On the other hand, we differ fromPassonneau in that we do not attempt to make use of fo-cus spaces in generation.
Rather we argue for evaluatinginformational dequacy on the basis of confusable ob-jects near the current sentence in a discourse.In the following section we hypothesize that discoursestructure in terms of multiple threads does have an ef-fact on appropriate anaphoric expression choice and thatthe temporal structure of a discourse is a particular in-stantiation of these threads (in the stories that we haveanalyzed).
We hypothesize that if there is a difference intime between the last reference to an entity and the cur-rent reference, a definite description is used (and whenthe time of the previous and the current reference is thesame, a pronoun is used).3 Long- and Short-Distance Anaphor/cExpressionsIn studying naturally oceu~ng texts in order to identifypatterns of pronoun usage, we found consistent patternsover both long distances (i.e., where the last referenceto the entity being referred to was more than two sen-tences back in the discourse) and over short distances(i.e., where the last reference to the entity being referredto was in the current sentence).In long-distance situations we have found that a defi-nite description isalmost always used.
In short-distancesituations a pronoun is almost always used (except in sit-uations where this pronoun is ambiguous).
Thus, the sen-tence seems to be a very important construct to considerin choosing anaphoric expressions.We now turn to consider the factors that might beaffecting the expression choice in situations other thanthese.
We hypothesize that discourse structure must beconsidered for such cases.4 "lime-Threaded Discourse StructureIn this section, we describe our approach to using dis.course structure for choosing the fight referring expres-sion.
Since we are working with stories from hewspaperswe were not able to identify the kind of discourse struc-ture as assumed by Orosz & $idner (1986), whose dia-logues are more task-oriented and have clear intentionalgoals.
Instead, the texts have a structure consisting ofmultiple story lines which we call threads (cf.
also Ro~et al (|995)).
A thread escribes a particular part of thestory.
It can be interrupted by other threads and contin-ued later.
Thus the tiueaded structure is more compli-cated than the hierarchical (~ee-like) structure posited inCn~sz & Sidner (1986) and Mann & Thompson (1988).Therefore, we do not think that he texts we looked at canbe analyzed using a stack (for example).We needed to find a structuring device that was partof the input o a sentence generation system and that wasrecognizable on the surface (so that we could evaluateour algorithm on naturally occurring text).
After invest/-65gating some work on narrative structure (Genette, 1980;Prince.
1982; Vogt, 1990), "we determined that changesin the deictic center of the story (Nakhimoysky, 1988:Wiebe, 1994) not only must be part of the input o a sen-tence generator (e.g., for appropriate nse generation),but were also both well marked in the text and seemed tohave an influence on anaphoric expression choice.A shift in the deictic center can be signaled by ashift of topic, a shift of time scale, a shift in spatialscale, or a shift in perspective (Nakhimovsky, 1988;Wiebe, 1994).
Since a shift in time scale is often indi-cated by linguistic means and the time being referred tomust be part of the input o a sentence generator, we con-centrated on this point.
We also acknowledge that thechanges in time seem quite important in the news storiesthat we analyzed.
Other genres of text might depend onother kinds of structuring devices.Changes in time scale or time, as we redefined the cat-egory, may require world knowledge reasoning to rec-oguize but are often indicated by either cue words andphrases (e.g., "n/he years ago ", " a year", "for months';"several months ago"), a change in .grammatical timeof the verb (e.g., past tense versus present ense), orchanges in aspect (e.g., atomic versus extended eventsversus tates as defined by Moens & Steedman (1988)).In considering how time change might affectanaphoric expression choice, we consider the choice forthe first mention of a discourse ntity in a sentence wherethat entity has recently been referred to in the discourse.Our hypothesis that: Changes in time reliably signalchanges of the thread in newspaper a ticles; definite de-scriptions hould appear when the current reference to adiscourse ntity is in a different thread from the last ref-erence to that entity and pronouns should occur when theprevious mention is in the same thread 3.In order to evaluate this hypothesis, we mapped outthe time being referenced in our texts on a clause-by-clause basis.
For each clause in the texts we indicatedthe time which was referred to.
We distinguished be-tween events that occurred at a single instance in time(atomi c events) and events or states that occurred over aspan of time (repeated atomic events, extended events,and states).
For atomic events we allowed for both a spe-cific time at which it occurred and for a non-specific timethat indicated the range of uncertainty.
We allowed timespans to have both specific end points and unspecifiedend points as well.An example from our corpus with its associated tem-poral structure may illustrate these labels, the complex-ity of the texts under consideration, and how we proposepronoun generation is affected.3Note that be discourse thread maychange b tween the tworeferences in question.
This would be signaled by a change intime in e_laeses between the two references in question.
We areinterested in whethor the two references are in the same (use apronoun) or different (use a definite description) thread.Example 2:(47a) Questioned about he criminal activitiesof the football club,(47b) Mrs. Mandela maintained(47c) that she had never had any control overthem.
(48a) This despite testimony from a halfdozen former members(48b) that they even had to get permission togo in and out of her yard.
(49a) Mrs. Mandela lso said(49b) she had disbanded the club(49c) after her husband asked her to, despiteevidence to the contrary.
(50) Mrs. Mandela faced questions frommore than 10 lawyers representing vari-ous victims and the panel of commission-ers and their investigators..198519901991lyearImonthlweeknow.

oo ,a '  D' e l  a '  b a '  b '  e l  I47 48 49 50Figure 1: Temporal Structure for Example 2Figure 1 contains the temporal structure for (eachclause) ofsentences 47-50 of one of our texts.
We ob-serve two threads in this discourse fragment, one deal-ing with events at the "now"-time of the story, the othertelling past events (1985-1991).
The corresponding sen-tences (also broken into clause, s t) are contained in Ex-ample 2.Notice that sentence 47 consists of three clauses.
Thefirst two (47a and 471)) describe atomic events that aretaking place at the "now" time of the story (during theproceedings against Mrs. Mandela).
The third clause(47c) refers to an indefinite span of time in the past (dur-ing which Mrs. Mandela's football club existed).
Note,the use of the past perfect in (47c) indicating the changein time and setting.?
As Figure I illustrates, there is a name (N) reference toMrs.
Mandela in (47b), and a pronominal 0P) reference-to her in (47c).
This pronoun is used even though thereis a change in time between (47b) and (47c) and is ex-plained because this is a sho~-distance reference since it4We take a C la l~ to ~ a finite verb.66is the second reference to Mrs. Mandela within the samesentence (a condition that overrules the time change hy-pothesis).
(48a) represents a change hack to the time of the pro-ceedings (note the discourse-deictic reference (Wehber,1991) "This").
(48b) again points to the time in the past,though this is not explicitly marked linguistically as itwas in (47c).
Here world knowledge must be used to un-derstand the time referenced in this clause.
Note, how-ever, that the time would have to be part of the input o agenerator, and thus our rules are completely well-definedfrom the generation perspectiv e .The use of a pronoun to refer to Mrs. Mandela in(48b) is warranted by our hypothesis, because the pre-vious mention of Mrs. Mandela in (47c) references thesame time as is referenced in (48b).
"Because there is a time change between (48b) and(49a), our hypothesis explains the appearance of theproper name in (49a) even though it occurs just aftera pronoun (in (48b)) co-specifying the same character?The pronouns in the remainder of(49) are explained be-cause they are subsequent references within the samesentence (despite the fact that they refer to an unspec-ified time in the past which is different from the timereferenced in (49a)).
Finally, theuse of a name in (50) isagain indicated by the change in time between (49c) and(50).5 AmbiguitiesOf course, the choice of referring expression is not onlyguided by discourse structure, there is also an influencedue to ambiguities.
Dale (1992) generated referring ex-pressions o that their referents could be distinguishedfrom the other discourse ntities mentioned in the con-text.
This strategy can be interpreted as: Generate a pro-noun whenever it is not ambiguous.
However, how oneshould define context is not quite clear.
For this defi-nition we choose a span of text considered important inour previous work on anaphora esolution (Slrube, 1998),and define a referring expression as ambiguous if thereis a competing antecedent (i.e.
another discourse ntitymatching in number and gender) mentioned in the pre-vious sentence or to the leR of the referring expressionin the current sentence.
Of the 437 referring expressionsin the texts we analyzed, 104 were considered ambigu-ous by this definition.
Of these only 51 were realized asa definite description.
Thus a rule which specifies useo f  a definite description if a pronoun would be ambigu-ous according to this definition appears to be too strict.Therefore we need to consider ambiguous cases in moredetail.sNote that he use of this definite description cannot beexplained by a topic shift since there is no topic shift in be-tween the previous text and (49).
At least wo discourse n-tities ("Mrs. Mandela" and the "football club") are constant,only Mrs. Mandela's husband does not occur in the immedi-ately preceding sentences.Consider the following excerpt taken from later in thesame story that contains Example i.
For convenience.references to the main character appear in bold, whilethose to a competing antecedent appear in italics.Example 3:Mr. Curtis might have lived out his live inobscurity if it were not for a New Haven tele-vision reporter.
Jim Hoffer, of station WTNH.who got an anonymous tip last summer thatMr.
Curtis had been attending college.
Us-ing a hidden camera, a crew taped Mr. Cur-lis going to his classes at Southern Connecti-cut State University, and a producer ecordeda conversation with him in a cafeteria.
In aclear, steady voice, Mr. Curtis can be heard tosay that he...Concentrating on the references to Mr. Curtis, wequestion when a pronoun can be used, and when thename should be used.
To handle cases where compet-ing antecedents occurred, we turned to pronoun resolu-tion algorithms.
Our intuition was that a pronoun couldbe generated to refer to a particular discourse ntity if?
a pronoun resolution algnr/thin woul d choose that entityas a referent for the pronoun.
To our knowledge, thereare only two focus-based pronoun resolution algorithmsthat are specified in enough detail to work on unrestrictednaturally occurring text: Brennan et al (1987) using thedefinition of utterance according to Kameyama (1998),and Struhe (1998).
Strube valuated the effectiveness ofthese two algorithms on the task of pronoun resolution isome naturally occurring texts.
Because Strube's algo-rithm showed significantly better results, we have turnedto it for guidance in pronoun generation.The idea is that if we want to refer to a discourse n-tity, E, but there is a competing antecedent, C, we look toStrube'S algorithm in the following way.
If Strube's algo-rithm would resolve apronoun to be K we use a pronoun.If, instead, Strube's algorithm would prefer C as the ref-erent of the pronoun, we would use a definite descriptionto refer to ~-.We evaluated this idea along with several other alter-natives (e.g., using discourse structure alone, using long-and short-distance rules ignoring the ambiguity, distin-gnishing between first and subsequent reference withina sentence, using a definite description whenever therewas ambiguity) on the ambiguous examples in our cor-pus.
Our analysis howed that the use of Strube's al-gnrithm showed improvement, but it seemed to be tooliberal with suggesting pronouns when the competingantecedent was in the previous entence.
AssumingStrube's algorithm reflects human processing of referringexpressions ( omething NOT claimed), what this meansis that in our texts the writer chose to generate a definitedescription even though a pronoun would have been in-formafionally adequate to resolve the referent correctly.This occurred most frequently over sentence boundaries.When a competing antecedcnt is within a sentence, how-ever, Strube's algorithm appears to be quite effective.67?
Thus  the rule we .settled on acknowledged the impor-tance of sentence boundaries and is shown in Figure 2.I.
i f  this is the first occurrence of X in the currentsentence and(a) /./'there isa competing antecedent i  the pre-vious sentence, use a definite description;(b) /f there is a competing antecedent in thesame sentence (i.e.. to the left) andi.

e/se use a definite description;2.
/./'this is a subsequent occurrence of X in the cur-rent sentence and(a) U" there is an intervening competing an-tecedent, use a definite description;Co) ~ there is no intervening competing an-t_ ,y~,,tttttJent, use a pronoun.Figure 2: Realization of X when Competing AntecedentsExist6 Anaphoric Referring ExpressionGeneration AlgorithmIn the previous ections we have argued that in someinstances of anaphoric expression choice, the threadeddiscourse structure must be taken into account.
For theparticular texts that we analyzed, we argue that threadsdefined in terms of the time referenced in a clause areappropriate for use.
Other kinds of discourses willalso exhibit a threaded structure, but the threads them-selves might be defined by different means.
In additionto discourse structure, the pote, ndal for ambiguity mustbe considered.
Additionally, cases of long- and short-distance anaphora should be handled indepandantlyofthe threaded iscourse slructure considerations.. Based on these findings, we propose the algorithm forrealizing anaphoric expressions shown in Figure 3.
Notein this algoriflun we refer to the notion of a discoursethread which might be defined differently for differentkinds of texts.7 Empirical DataWe applied the algorithm described in the previous ec-tion to three texts from the New York Tunes.
Articles.ranged from a frontpage article ?to local news.
We ap-plied the algorithm to all references to persons in thesetexts.
The algorithm was correct in 370 cases (84.7%),and wrong in 67 cases (15.3%).
In Figure 4 we show thedistribution over the rules specified in the algorithm.In order to interpret the results of the algorithm, wemust have some comparison.
We use a simple schemewhich does not consider threaded iscourse structureand which bandies ambiguous cases very conservatively.I.
If this is a long distance anaphoHc reference(i.e., if the previous reference to X was more thantwo sentences prior) use a definite description;2. elseif this is an unambiguous reference (i.e., there isrio competing ang~_~_~t) and this is an lntra-sentential naphor (i.e., this is not the first men-tion of X in the current sentence) use a pronoun;3. elseif this is a thread change (i.e., the previous refer-ence to X occurred in a thread ifferent from theone in which the current reference occurs) use adefinite description;4. else/f there is a competing antecedent (i.e., anotherobject in the previous or current sentence thatmatches the type and number of X) use the rulefound in Figure 2;5.. elsefor the remaining cases (i.e., unambiguous caseswhen time remains the same) use a pronoun.Figure 3: Algorithm for Generating an Anaphoric Refer-ring Expression for Discourse Entity XThis scheme is shown in Figure 5 for comparison pur-poses.The results of applying these rules give 343 correctcases (78.5%) and 94 incorrect ones (21.5%).
Hence ouralgorithm reduces the error rate by 28.9%.8 Related ResearchA significant amount of work in linguistics has investi-gated the use of different kinds of anaphoric referringexpressions in discourse and their relationship to easeof comprehension.

Basically, the more acces-sible a referent the more underspecified a refen'ing ex-pression should be.
Accessibility explains the apparent"name-name p nalty" as examined in Gordon & Hen-chick (1998), for example.Our work argues that factors beyond accessibility mustbe considered inanaphoric expression choice.
It is con-sistent with work such as Vonk et ai.
(1992) whose ex-periments indicate that a referring expression "... that ismore specific than is necessary for the recovery of theintended referent ... marks the beginning of a new themeconcerning the same discourse referenC'(Vonk et al.1992, page 304).
They argue that such overspecified x-pressions are serving a discourse function of indicatingboundaries.
This work does not define what a discoursesegment boundary actually is.
On the other hand, usingthe definition of time change as a boundmy condition,our work is consistent with their hypothesis.
Interest-ingly, Vonk et al (1992) found that in discourses wherea theme change was wen marked by other means (e.g.,by a preposed adverbial phrase or a subordinate clauseindicating time or place) that pronouns were much morecommon even though anew theme was begun.
Presum-ably such phrases mark the theme change well, and thusit is not necessary to also mark the change via an over-specified escription.Approaches which define discourse segments on thebasis of reference resolution (Sidner, 1979; Suri & Mc-Coy, 1994; Strobe & Hahn, 1997) are not useful for ourpurposes because they require referring expressions forrecognizing segment boundaries.
In contrast to these ap-proaches, we define segment boundaries independentlyfrom reference r solution so that in this respect our workis in line with Grnsz & Sidner's (1986) definitions.9 Future DirectionsIn analyzing our data, there are several places for furtherconsideration.
One problem is that our rule which in-dicates a definite description should be used in a timechange overgenerates definite descriptions.
FollowingVonk et al (1992) we plan to investigate whether definitedescriptions might best be viewed as boundary markersand whether other markers of discourse boundaries (e.g.,preposed adverbial phrases) are found in places whereour algorithm suggests a definite description because ofa time change but a pronoun appear~ in the text.In addition to evaluating more texts under this scheme,there are several places where we will attempt to tightenour methodology.
One of these is in the time analysis.Our current analysis distinguishes between four types oftime and is driven by both semantic cues in the text (e.g.,adverbial time phrases) and changes in tense.
Nakhi-movsky (1988) also uses changes in "`time scale" as amarker for changes in time.
We plan to investigate histo see whether itexplains more of the examples.
Nakhi-movsky also describes several other markers for a settingchange, and these will also be investigated tosee if theyare indicative of definite description use.Another line of future research involves further in-vestigation of the ambiguous cases.
Our current rulewas developed by evaluating several different possibil-ities (e.g., using time change rules, different pronounresolution algorithms) and selecting a rule that explainsmost of the cases.
Still, the number of ambiguous casesis fairly small and analyzing more texts and concentrat-ing on cases where the current rule makes an incorrectprediction may lead us to a more robust rule.Finally, further thought must be put into evaluating thealgorithm.
In particular, our current evaluation method-ology presupposes that the human writer has chosen thebest anaphoric expression.
It may be interesting to see ifthere are differences between reading time, eye move-ments, or comprehension f stories with the human-generated expressions and those using our algorithm.Thought must be put into setting up such experimentsand into interpreting results.
For example, a faster ead-ing time may not indicate abetter choice of referring ex-pression (since the writer may have been interested inaneffect other than ease of comprehension).
On the otherhand, such experiments have the potential for produc-ing a more adequate evaluation of the methodology thandoes mimicking the human-produced t xt and should belooked into further.10 ConclusionsPronouns occur frequently in texts and have been hy-pothesized to play a significant role in text coherence.Yet, pronoun generation has not been studied in detail.If future natural language generation systems are to pro-duce coherent, natural texts, they must use rules for gen-erating pronouns that produce pronouns in roughly thesame places that human-produced texts do.
M~oreover,the rules must be based on informationthat would bcavailable to a sentence generator.
At thesame time, inorder to evaluate rules, they must be based on informa-tion that can be gleaned from a text.In this work we have argued that discourse structure69in terms of multiple threads provides an explanation forpatterns of pronoun use in naturally occurring text.
As aparticular instantiation fa threaded discourse Structure,we looked at changes in setting, as indicated by changesin time.
That is, even in places where apronoun would beunambiguous, a definite description might be used whenthe time of the sentence is different from the time of thesentence inwhich the previous mention was made.
Thishypothesis provides an explanation for many of the usesof definite descriptions found in the studied texts.
Otheruses of definite descriptions occur because of ambigu-ities.
We have suggested a rule which addresses whensuch ambiguities should not preclude the generation "ofa pronoun.
Our scheme appears to be a reasonable ex-planation for the patterns of pronoun use found in ourcorpus.Acknowledgments.
