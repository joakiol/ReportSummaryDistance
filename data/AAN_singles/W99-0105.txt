itAbstractThis paper explores the idqa that the operationsof positing and resolving bridging anaphora in NPswith deverbal heads can be successfully guided byconsidering as possible implicit relations those sug-gested by the argument s ructures of the correspond-ing verbs.
We exploit the event/result reading dis-tinction, combined with other aspeetual informa-tion.
From there, we work out the idea that there isone particular argument, ermed the faeourite, thatplays a key role in correctly situating the NP referentwithin the discourse.I IntroductionThis paper explores the idea that the operationsof positing and resolving bridging anaphom in NPswith deverbal heads can be successfully guided byconsidering as possible implicit relations those sug-gested by the argument s ructures of the correspond-ink verbs.Bridging is a referential phenomenon occurringwhen the referent of ~t linguistic expression can bedetermined only by recovering a meaningful implicitrelation with an already mentioned entity or event.For example, in the following Italian sentences, thecorrect interpretation for richieste requires the iden-tification of the implidt relation between the set ofrequests for underwriting and the bond to be under-written.ex.

The s~cond, exemplified by(BOS, Buitelaar, and Mineur, 1995), relies primarilyon augmenting the lexicon annotating for each nounits possible meaningful relations.
We believe that, atleast for the particular kind of bridging we are con-cerned with, the second approach is most promisinggiven that, in some cases, a limited amount of lex-icon annotation can greatly enhance resolution ef-ficiency and efficacy: by using algorithms and rulesrelying on linguistic information we can significantlyconstrain inference on cognitive processing.
Ourcontribution goes along the lines proposed in (Grc~and Sidner, 1998).We are interested in deverbal nouns (e.g.
~build-inK" derived from %o build", and "request" derivedfrom "to request ") and we endorse the claim thatbridging occurring in NPs with a deverbal noun headshould be resolved by considering as possible implicitrelations those suggested by the argument structureof the corresponding verb, cf.
inter alia (Badia andSaurl, 1998) and (Rozwadowslm, 1988) for investiga-tions on thematic restrictions on derived nominals.We think that the way the verb argument structuremaps onto the noun argument positions depends onwhether the deverbal nouns denote an event,.or aresulting state or part/c/pant in the correspondingeventuality.
The ides of  exploiting the event/resultreading distinction, combined with other aspectualinformation, was primed by the linguistic data col-lected during corpos analysis and proved to be quitepromising.
We then take it one step forward andwork out which is the noun argument whose (covertor overt) presence isneeded for a proper understand-ing of the text.
This idea is captured by the notionof/ovourite.Our work fits in the context of automatic infor-mation extraction.
In connection with the FACILEEuropeanproject (LE 2440), we developed a mod-ule for texture resolution I (TRM) to be integratedin a system of information extraction from Italianfinancial news.
The TRM tracks entities as theyIThe te.~ure of a text is "related to the listener's per-ceptio, of coherence" and is "manifested by certain kinds ofsemantic relations \[called cohesive ties\] between i~ individualmessage" (Hallidsy and Hssan, 1985).
Examples of cohesiveties are: coreference, bridging and coclassification.39are introduced in the discourse and uses a set ofdeclarative rules to guess Which cohesive ties hold fora certain referring expression.
An exploratory cor-pus analysis (on 13 Italian financial news for a totalof 1467 words) showed that bridging is a frequentanaphoric phenomenon (43,3% of the total cohesivelinks).
Moreover, NPs with a deverbal noun as headamounted to 19.6% of the NPs in the corpus and21% of the bridgings came from deverbals.
Buildingon observations made on our corpus, we first formu-lated hypotheses for bridging resolution in linguisticterms.
Then we went back to our corpus to verifytheir consistence with respect o the data.
Finally,we turned them into heuristics that help recoguisethe thematic role played by modifiers in nominali-sations and that suggest where missing argumentsshould be recovered from the discourse context.2 Properties of deverbalnominalisationsThere is an assumed parallelism in argument s ruc-ture between deverbal nouns and the verbs to whichthey are related, but its strength is said to vary.
(Grimshaw, 1990) distinguishes between event  nom-inals, that express an event or a process whoseexistence is entailed, and restdt nominals, thatname/denote the output of the event or an entity re-lated to it but do not entail the existence of the cor-responding event.
Event nominals obligatorily havean argument structure derived from the associatedverb and assign specific thematic roles.
For instancein:ex.
La costruzione della ?asa richiese tre anni\[The construction ofthe house took three .yell/a casa is assigned the role of patient in the the-rustic grid of the corresponding verb costruir?.Result nominals, by contrast, take a kind of se-mantic participants hat are more loosely associatedwith the argument s ructure and the correspondingthematic roles.
For instance, the di NP phrase inex.
la costruzione di Daniele & la pih bells\[ the construction ofDaniele is the nicest\]can be interpreted as referring to the agent, i.e.
theconstructor, but also to the mere possessor of thebuilding.
Encoding in the lexicon the event/resultreading distinction for a nominalisation is straight-forward when using a conceptual dictionary likeWordNet (Fellbanm, 1998): it's enough to searchup in the hierarchy.
For example, the noun build-ing belongs to different synsets (i.e.
it has differentsenses): one has ent/ty among its hypernyms (andthus it expresses a resu/t) and the other two haveact as hypernym (and thus they express an event).Thus this noun has both event and restdt, readings."
40Tile difference in the way argu~fi'ents are realisediu tile two readings is relevant for our purpose.
InLhe La.~k of Lexture resolution, we have to find outprecisely how to interpret PP modifiers z, posses-sires and other potentially referential expressionssurrounding a nominal, and when to posit a bridginganaphora nd to which entity.Nominalised expressions in English and Italian donot share always the same syntactic forms.
En-glish nominals have several argument positions thatcan map into the basic verb arguments ( ubject, di-rect and indirect objects), cf.
(Macleod et al, 1997)for a computational treatment.
They are (i) pos-sessives (e.g.
"His announcements", "Daniel's ap-pointment*); (ii) pre-nominal noun modifier (e.g.
"The State Department announcement"); (iii) post-nominal prepositional phrase (e.g.
q'he announce-meat of the White House").
In Italian, the grammarof nominalisation phrases is somewhat simpler.
Ar-guments can be expressed either by a .possessive 3or relative pronouns, classified as prenominal modi-tiers (e.g.
~il suo annuncio" \[his announcement\], ~ilcui annuncio" \[whose announcement\]), or PPs, herecalled postnominal modifiers (e.g.
"l'annuncio del' presidente" \[the announcement of he president\]), cf.
(Renzi, 1991) for a description.Only PPs of the form di NP (lit.
o\[ PP in English)raise interesting questions from our point of view,since PPs other than di NP can be interpreted di-rectly by looking at the argument structure of therelated verb, broadly speaking.
The major difficultycomes from roles assigned to verb argument posi-tions which are not 'identified' by specific preposi-tions, because these roles can be mapped into thesame position in the corresponding nominals.
In-deed, nominals derived from transitive verbs poten-tially bring in ambiguities, ince the thematic rolesof agent and patient can both be assigned to pos-semives and PPs of the form di NP (e.g., agent: "Intelefunata di Maria" \[the telephone call by Maria\]vs. patient: 'Temissione di nuove asioni" \[the newshare issue\]).
Besides, note that a PP of the formdi NP can discharge also other roles, for instancean oblique such as material (e.g.
"In costruzione dimattoni" \[the construction made of bricks\]).
FUr-thermore, it can be used to exp~ roles in relationsthat are not necessarily part of an argument struc-ture, such as possession.The literature offers discussions on patterns forcoding nominalisations and their arguments (Meyerset al, 1998), (Badia and Sanri, 1998).
It is notedthat whether or not a position is filled may affectthe interpretation f other positions.
It is also dis-~Here modifiers is a cover term for complements, adjunctsand so on.aNote that morphological greement goes with the nomi-nal.
Semantic agreement (with the possessor) is not .allowed.000@0@00@@@0000@0@0@0000@@@0@@0000@00@0000@OOOOOOO@O4)OOOOO@OO@OOO4)O@Oe@O@OOOOOOOOOeO@OOe\cussed the status of 'optional' arguments to nouns.In some sense, these papers try to give 'maximal;descriptions of nominalisations.
Our concern is dif-ferent.
We want t~ identify the texture of a text.Therefore, we want to know when a bridging can besafely posited and how to resolve it.
To this aim,'minimal' descriptions are best suited because theytrigger the hypothesis that there is a bridging in areduced number of cases, with a higher degree ofcertainty and provide precise information for its res-olution.
We capitalise on the observation that in theinterpretation Of a nominalisation there are prefer-ences in the assignment of a certain thematic rolein a certain context, and that one of the basic com-plements appears to be singled out.
This type ofpreference is different from the distinction betweenobligatory and optional complements.
We describethis situation via the notion of favourite argumentwhich has semantic and syntactic facets:?
From a semantic point of view, the notion offavourite captures the following idea.
For eachnominal, there is a thematic role (the favouriteargument) that must be assigned for the refer-ent to be correctly situated wi'thin the discoursecontext.
For example, for the Italian nomi-nal costruzione (construction) derived from theverb costruire (to construct) the favourite is thethematic role of patient.
In the sentence:ex.
La costruzione della cas~ r/chiese tre aani.\[The construction of the house took threeyears.\]the- patient (i.e.
the house) is essential for theinterpretation of the sentence.
Were it miss-- lag, as in ~La v0s.truzione dchiese tre anni", we?
would be forced to search in the previous dis-course for a coreference or a bridging link onthe construction.We hypothesize that the favourite role is unique,even if not nw.essadly the same for all nomi-nab.
It can be overfly assigned, by mappingit into the unique argumental position reaIised,provided it is of a compatible form 4, or into oneof the arguments if there are more.
Otherwise,one must assume that there is an understoodrelation of coreference or bridging.
Given ourhypothesis that the favourite role is unique andprovides the minimal and sufficient informationto recover the cohesive texture of discourse, nobridging is posited on arguments other than thefavoudte.Evidence in support of a unique favourite comesfrom the consistent preference recorded in nat-urally occurring instances, and from the use of4SelectJonaJ restriction or other semantic checks are usedto test compatibility.
An ex~npJe of non-compatible form isto coltsmzione d; ie~ \[the construction of yesterdsy\].41recovering strategies in case 0fpotential mis-matches between the favourite's qualificationand world knowledge.
For instance, in "Incostruzione di Daniele richiese tre anni" \[theconstruction of Daniele took three years\], thepredicate forces a reading as event of the de-verbal.
The favourite is the role of patient,whereas world knowledge would prompt he roleof agent for di Daniele.
As a matter of fact, theprimary interpretation of this sentence issome-thing like 'the construction of the statue por-traying Daniele ...', which accommodates therole of patient.From a syntactic point of view, the notion offavourite xpresses the fact that there must bean explicit or implicit modifier to which thefavourite thematic role is assigned.
Both posses-sires and PPs of the form di NP are compatibleforms for the semantic favourite, but in case ofcompetition, the PP is preferred.
The favouriteposition is the one closest o the noun.Our notion of favourite argument differs from thenotion of core thematic role in (Barker, 1995) in atleast three respects.
First, the favourite does notidentify a role discharged by the deverbal itself, asit i~ the case of the core role.
Instead, it expressesa condition applying to a (overt or covert) modifierofthe deverbal.
Second, it is not used to encode thedistinction between event and result readings of thedeverbal.
Indeed, such a distinction is presupposedfor the favourite to be computed.
Third, it identifiesa participant in the relation expressed by the clever-hal.
Moreover, the favourite does not identify therelation itself via the instantiation of the event vari-able, for the cases of event reading, nor the role thatis discharged by the deverbal, for theresult reading,as in (Barker, 1995).
Note that this last point doesnot preclude the possibility of having event positionsin the argument list of the predicate representationof the corresponding verb.2.1 Heuristics for themat ic  rolesassignmentStarting from observations made on our corpus ofItalian financial news, we define heuristics for theidentification of the semantic favourite using aspec-tual information.
Beside the event/result dichotomy,we further distinguish results as originating from sta-tire (to/mow) or eventive (to construct) predicates.We also distinguish eventives where the existence ofa participant is affected by the existence/happeningof the event described by the predicate (to constructa home) from eventivas where it is not (to cap-ture a lion).
Let's call the former an E(xistence)A(ffecting) type of predicate.
Our hypothesis thatthis distinction is more relevant than other aspectualsubsp~.cifications because" we are concerned with ref-erential issues.We worked out the following heuristics for the in-terpretation of modifiers:?
Whenever there are several PP modifiers, thefavourite thematic role must be assigned to themodifier closest o the nominal which has a com-patible form.
World knowledge tells us that col-legio and convento are collective ntities thatcan be agent in an event'of construction orbuildings and hence be patient.
However, thefollowing example allows only the interpretationof patient for collegio.ex.
La coetruzione del collegio del convento\[The construction of the boarding schoolof the convent\]As for convento, it can be the agent or the pos-se~or.?
In the absence of a modifier that can act asthe favourite, there must be coreference or abridging anaphora on the favourite.?
For a nominalisation which is a restdt:.If it is an EA predicate, the nominal denotesthe entity affected by the event, e.g.
the pa-tient, and the corresponding theta role cannotbe discharged overtly.
The search space for theinterpretation fthe modifiers is pruned accord-ingiy.
The favourite is the agent but, because aresult is an object and not an event, other rela-tions such as possession cannot be ruled out:ex.
La costruzione di Maria venne giudicatacome la pitt solida.\[The construction of Maria was consideredas the firmest.\]If it is not an EA predicate, then patient is thefirst role to be discharged in the case of an even-tive predicate.ex.
La cattura di Made ci sorprese.\[the capture of Marie surprised us.\]In the cue of a stative predicate, a mod-ifier is more likely to  diKharge the role ofagent /~r .ex.
La conoecenza di Daniele ~ sconflnsta.\[Daniele's knowledge is unlimited.\]?
For a- nominalisation which is an event therole assigned to the direct object of the corre-sponding predicate must be discharged by thefavourite s and it is discharged by a PP of formdi NP.SFor the sake of brevity, let's assume that it is always thepatient.42ex.
La Costruzione della casa fu lunga elaboriosa.\[The construction of the house was longand tiresome.\]If there are more than one PP modifier, the PPdischarging the patient role occurs closest o thenominal.in cases where a deverbal nominalisation may havein principle both result and event readings, as inthe case of costruzione, some additional aspectualor semantic information can help to discriminatethe reading occurring in the discourse context un-der consideration:?
Modifiers may have discriminating power:If there is a modifier that can be identified asthe patient (we can use standard selectionai re-strictions uch as animate...), then the readingas result is ruled out, as in:ex.
La costruzione della casa ...\[The construction of the house ... \]On the contrary, if there is a single modifier,which is a PP of form di NP, that can be identi-fied unambiguously asthe agent, then the nom-inal is a result, as in:ex.
La costruzione del bambino...\[The construction of the child.. .
\]0 ff information on the role of the modifiers helpsin interpreting/identifying thetype of nominaland vice versa, we fall in a bit of a circular pro-cem.
However, sometimes the discriminatingpower of predicates can help in disambiguatingthe word sense.
If the predication is about thetemporal dimension, then the reading as resultcan be ruled out, as in the building was slow.If the prech'cation is about the physical/spatialdimension, then the nominal is a result, as inthe building is high.2.2 Corpus based verif ication of  theheuristicsThe ~ exploratory corpus analysis we conductedon Italian financial news confirmed the validityof the linguistic hypothesis given above.
Textswere annotated systematically with an SGML tag-ging: for each deverbal nominalisation the read-ing (whether event or result) and aspectual class(whether state, activity, accomplishment or achieve-ment) are marked, and for each corresponding modi-tier, its linguistic form and its thematic and syntacticrole with respect o the originating verb are speci-fied.
See figure 1 for a sample of annotated text.Contrary to what we expected, the corpus anal-ysis revealed that the aspectual class does not con?tribute significantly to the positing and resolving of0@00@@@0000@0@000000@0@0@@0000O00000000$<news id = "10"  > La Banca Agricola Manto-vana ha  deliberato di dar corso ad <np id = 60> una <head type  = "event"  aspect .=  "ac-compl i shment"  > emissione </head> <pp prep-- "di" theta = "patient" syntax = "direct-object" > di obbligazioni non convertibili </pp><pp prep ="d i "  theta = "measure" syntax --"adjunct" > dell' importo complessivo di 100 mii-iardi di life </pp> </np> .. .

Table 1, summarizesour corpus-based findings.In the table, under the column "other" we havegrouped occurrences of deverbal nominalisationswhose analysis falls outside the scope of this re-search.
They are coreferential anaphora, specific refoerences, generic references, nominals with di PP ex-pressing the only obligatory thematic role, nominalswith bridging on the only obligatory thematic role.3 Computational use of theheuristics for positing andresolving bridgingThe heuristics described above can be profitably ex-ploited in a system for automatic nformation extrac-tion to improve the efficacy of the texture resolutionmodule.The Texture Resolution Module (TRM) we devel-oped in connection with the FACILE project triesto identify the reference function that each NP playsin a text (anaphora, generic reference, specific refer-ence, iota (unique) reference, predicative function)and tries to guess possible cohesive ties (Not andZancanaro, 1998).
The key idea underlying theTRM design is to coadder the process of textureresolution as a three step process:I. for each referring expression, determine the ref-erence function which may apply according tothe linguistic form of the NP (for example, pro-nouns are never considered as potential iotas);2. for each guess of anaphoric reference function.look for potential antecedents (coreference istried first; if this search fails or is not satis-factory, try other cohesive ties, like bridging orcoclassification):(2.a) select the search space where to look forantecedents;(2.b) collect all the entities in the search spacewhich can be taken as referent for the con-sidered expression.
Different ests are ap-plied, for example checking semantic om-patibility and eliminating redundant solu-tions;3. for each sentence,(3.a) test the compatibility of the guesses madeseparately on each referring expression wrtintrasentential constraints (for example, C-command and contraindexing);(3.b) order the alternative guesses according tointersentential preferences (like centering).The heuristics presented in ?2.1 can be used torefine step 2 in the algorithm:2. for each guess of anaphoric reference function:?
if the NP is a deverbal nominalisation then:- look  for potential antecedents for acoreference.- If a hypothesis of coreference Could notbe verified (or is too weak for the TRMto be completely satisfied with it), thenlook for possible bridgings.
As a firststep, look in the conceptual dictionaryand:A ) If the nominaiisation has onlyone possible reading (either resultor event) then apply the appropriateheuristics for interpretingmodifiers:- if a compatible modifier is foundthat discharges the favourite, thenno other bridging relations arelooked for;?
if there are no compatible mod-iRers, so that the favourite rolecannot be discharged, a bridgingis guessed and the potential an-tecedent is looked for in the previ-ous discourse as in steps (2.a) andB ) If the deverbal nominalisation canhave both result and process read-ings, then:?
verify whether semantic hecks onthe modifiers or other aspectual in-formatlon help to discriminate be-tween the two readings, using theheuristics.
If a discrimination suc-ceeds, then proceed to step \[A\].?
otherwise, try to guess possiblebridgings for both result and processreadings.eF'or the sake o/'simpliclty, the discussion t'ocusses only onanaphoric links.
Howe~fer, these observations can be general-.i~cl to cataphora too.43result, EAresult, not P-A(eventive~eventambiguousagentivetot~agent in favouriteposition as di PPpat ient  in favourite bridgingposit ion as di PP on agent4173 20..~- ?bridging other  totalon pat ient2 93 4 IO9 13 39?

else, proceed as usual, looking for potentialantecedents:(2.a)(2.b)select he search space where to look forantecedents;collect all the entities in the searchspace which can be taken as a referentfor the considered expression.
Differenttests are applied, for example, to checkfor the semantic ompatibility and toeliminate redundant solutions;4 Conclusion and Future workThis paper presents an extension of computattionalapproa~ee to bridging in deverbal NPs that use theverb argument structure.
Unlike other works onnominalisations which aim at a full description ofthe status of each argument in the deverbal noun,our approach is mainly concerned with the codingof the 'minimai' nformation which is necessary forsafely positing and resolving bridging phenomena.Minimal de~dptions are best suited for our com-putational task because they trigger the hypothesisthat there is s bridging in a reduced number of cases,with a higher degree of certainty and provide preciseinformation for its resolution.For a deeper evaluation of the effectiveness of theheuristics presented here, we plan to extend our tex-ture resolution algorithm according to the computa-tional rules described in section 3, in order to runverification tests on & larger corpus.
In this __-~co__ndphase, additional effort will be invested for the anno-tation of separate training and test corpus which willbe used for a more objective valuation of precisionand recall.
Another issue we would like to investi-gate is the extension of our notion of/ueour/te toother cases of nominal roles, for example meronymsand attributes.
This would not require additionalannotation in the lexicon, given that in a concep-tual dictionary like WordNet meronyms are alreadypresent and there are plans to insert attributes (Fell-baum, 1998).44ReferencesAsher, Nicholas and Alex Lascarides.
