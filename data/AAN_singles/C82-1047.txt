1982RANDOM GENERATION OF CZECH SENTENCESJarmila Panevov~Department of Applied MathematicsFaculty of Mathematics and PhysicsCharles UniversityPragueCzechoslovakiaThe experiments testing the theoretical adequacyand the practical usefulness of the FunctionalGenerative Descript ion (FGD) are described.
TheFGD consists of a generative component, which,in the experimental version, has the shape of acontext-free grammar combined with elements ofdependency approach, and the other componentshaving the form of pushdown store automata.
Thelatter components have a transductive role, trans-ducing the semantie Ctectogrammatical) represent-ations of sentences to the lower levels of thelanguage system.
The transduction is articulatedinto several steps corresponding more or less tothe levels of language system Csurface syntax,morphemics, morphophonemics, phonemics, or, asthe case may be, graphemics) postulated in Europ-ean structural linguistics.
The theoretical andpractical qualit ies of the system are evaluated.i.
The model of generative description called Functional Gener-ative Description CFGD) was proposed early in the sixties (Sgall,1964~, and it is worked out from that time by the'group of algebraiclinguistics, Charles University, Prague.
This description is beingenriched and completed from the empirical point of view and from thepoint of view of i ts theoretical adequacy.
TO allow for a systematicelaboration of both of these aspects, FGD is tested on computers inthe form of random generation of semantic representations of Czechsentences and of transducing them to their outer shape.
The computertesting fulfils also another aim: FGD, beside being an appropriateframework for empirical study and theoretical description of langua-ge, can also be applied as a background for practical projects, suchas synthesis for machine translation into Czech, synthesis for ans-wers in question-answering systems etc.2.
The main features distinguishing FGD from most of otherlinguistic frameworks are: (i) in FGD there is no place where trans-formationrules are needed~ Cii) the generative power is concentratedin its first component, generating underlying representations onthe level of l inguistic meaning representing a specific patterningof extralinguistic, ontological content , the set of generated~trinqs surpassing only moderately the set of context-free lanquaqes(Pl~tek and Sgall, 1978)~ (iii) FGD is based on a dependency approachto svntax; (iv) a stratif icational approach is used here, articulat-ing the generation of sentences into several steps corresponding toparticular language levels ordered from meaning to the outer shape295296 J. PANEVOV.~<level of tectogrammatics, of surface syntax, of morphemics,morpho-phonemics and at the end graphemics in our case, or the phonemic le-vel in a theoretical description).Describing the theoretical features of FGD it must be stressedthat the description intself is being developed much more quicklythan the system of programmes can reflect.
The first component of FGD,generating tectogrammatical representations (TR's), was reformulatedfrom the shape of formalism corresponding to context-free phrasestructure grammar with elements of dependency features <Sga!l, 1967>into a pure dependency formalism using pushdown store automata andincluding also description of the topic/focus art iculation of thesentence (see Haji~ov~ and Sgall, 1980>.3.
The component generating TR's was implemented in the olderform, as a context-free grammar.
The first experiments with randomgeneration are restricted to a relatively small lexicon: somethingabout 300 "deep" lexical units; the number of units increases on thesurface level, where also function words are present, as well as theunits gained by means of "syntactic" derivation in Kury~owicz (1936)sense (suff ixation and prefixation serving for nominalizons, etc.>.The enriched output lexicon consists of more than 1500 units.
As forthe grammatical phenomena concerning the different l inguistic levels,we tried to make the system relatively complete even in the firststage of the experiments; the coordinated constructions, the pronounsof the ist and 2nd person and some of the possible word order variantswere Omitted in this stage.4.
We concentrate our attention, first of all, on the transduct-ive components.
All the l inguistical ly relevant semantic informationis included in the TR's, where we have to do with disambiguated re-presentations, identical for all synonymous surface variants.
Thismeans that the transductive components describe the asymmetric dual-ism between a function and its forms (in the sense of Karcevskij,1929, and the Prague School of Linguistics, cf.
Vachek, 1964).
Therelation between form and function may be i l lustrated by the follow-ing examples, concerning the relations between a TR and the correspond-ing surface syntactic representations and between these and the morph-emic ones: The participant actor may be expressed either by surfacesubject, or by an adverbial of actor (in passive constructions>, bya possessive adjective, or a noun in genitive or instrumental (withnominalizations>; the functor (Fil lmore's 'case'>Instrument may beexpressed by the morphemic case of instrumental, or by preposit ionalconstructions n a + locative, pomocf + genitive.The mathematical  apparatus used for the transduction componentsof FGD is a sequence of pushdown store automata, transducing the TRinto the surface representations <dependency trees> and the latterinto morphemic ones <strings>; then follows a finite automaton trans-ducing the representation into the graphemic output form <there aresome differences in this respect between the theoretical descriptionof language and the procedure serving for applied projects>.
On bothlevels of the structure of the sentence the dependency tree represent-ing the structural order has as its root the predicate of the mainclause, which is the only one node not dependent on any other node.Every node is labelled by a representation of a single (autosemantic)word form, having the  shape of a complex symbol containing its syn-tactic, morphological  and lexical parts, corresponding to the char-acter of the particular level.
The dependency tree preserves the ~on-dit ion of projectivity.Each transduction of the ~epresentation of the structure of thesentence to the adjacent level needs a pair of automata.
The condit-RANDOM GENERATION OF CZECH SENTENCES 297ions constra in ing the t ransduct ion  to the next level can be charact -er ized as fol lows:<a> In a g iven step on ly  a s ingle dependency syntagm <the govern ingword and its modi f icat ion> is processed; one of the two steps ad-justs the morpho log ica l  features <cal led grammatemes,  cf.
Panevov~,1979) 1980> in accordance wi th  certa in  propert ies  of the other  memberQf the syntagm; most ly  the mod i f ie r  changes according to the charact-er of its govern ing word: e.g.
the actor of a pass ive verb comes overinto an adverbial ,  that of a nomina l ized verb Ca surface noun> intoan at t r ibute :host4  ~ i~ l i  - p~fchod host6 <the guests  arr ived - thearr ival  of the guests>.<b> A s ingle pass through the sentence <in the text - to - ru le  order>is suf f ic ient  for every transducer.<c> The process of t ransduct ion  is based on the govern ing unit  beinghandled by every pushdown automaton ear l ier  that its modi f i cat ions<dependent words>.
We work with the new character is t ics  of the gov-erning word when its mod i f i ca t ions  are being processed.The main  programme <the def in ing funct ion> of every automatonis based on the fact that the root of every dependency tree is pro-cessed as first.
<It should be noted that the l inear ized dependencytree is converted into the sequence "regens post rectum"; neverthe-less, not only this structura l  order, but also the l inear order ,moreor le"s d i rect ly  corresponding to the surface <morphemic9 word order,are preserved in it>.
Then the f i rst  member  f rom the r ight dependingon the root is read by the automaton I and compared wi th  the root,i.e.
modi f ied  according to its propert ies.
If the last word form readhas no modi f iers ,  it may be pr inted on the output  from the given au-tomaton; if there is some modi f ier  present,  the govern ing word isp laced into the pushdown store and this pair  of word forms connectedby the dependency re lat ion is then compared and evaluated.
This meansthat the matr ices  or tables descr ibed in deta i l  in Panevovl  <1979>are involved, where the changes ob l igatory  or opt ional  for the g ivenpair  of word forms <syntagm> are determined.
These tables form aninner part  of the automaton,  which cannot  be separated from the workof the whole  procedure;  the empir ica l  data determin ing the choice ofthe means <forms> for funct ions <meanings> are involved here.
Theword form processed in a g iven t ime point  can be pr inted in the out-put only in such a point  when all the subtrees dependent  on it havea l ready been printed.
On the output  of every pushdown t ransducer  butthe last <i.e.
w i th  the except ion of the morphemic  representat ion>we again receive an order of word forms adapted to the further pro-cess ing ~f the root of the tree as the f i rst  nod~;the modi fy ing  <de-pendent> nodes are read from the r ight side.5.
We want to present  here a short survey of the l inguist icproblems solved by the indiv idual  automata: The f i rst  pair  of auto-mata chooses the act ive and pass ive construct ions,  non~inalization,in f in i t ive const ruct ion  or subord inate clause.
Due to the opt iona l -ity of some rules <synonymy between e.g.
Sna~i l  se , aby p~i~el  v~as-subord inate clause, Sna~i l  se p  i j i t  v~as - in f in i t ive construct ion,Sna~il  se o v~asn~ p  fch0d - nomina l ized form of He at tempted to comein time>, in the cases where we have to do wi th  the choice betweenseveral  equ iva lent  construct ions  a probab i l i ty  for part icu lar  poss ib-i l i t ies has been added <determined in a qui te pre l iminary  way, theresul ts  of which are being checked in the course of the exper iments>.The rules of choosing s imple or prepos i t iona l  cases, subordin-at ing conjunct ions,  etc.
are a matter  of the t ransduct ion  from surf-ace syntax to morphemics.
There also the morphemic  uni ts  of number,verbal  aspect,  tense etc.
are assigne4; e.g.
w i th  the word formscharacter ized <by an index> as a "plurale tantum", any grammateme of298 J. PANEVOV.6number is ob l igator i l y  converted to plural  as a morphemic  unit: n~k\ [<scissors>, ka lhot  Z <trousers>.
The rules of grammat ica l  congruenceare also appl ied here <congruence between ad ject iva l  ad juncts  andtheir head noun, between subject and predicate,  etc.>.For the formulat ion  of such rules, of course, deta i led  empir ic -al studies about contextua l  condi t ions  in f luenc ing the choice of thepar t icu lar  express ion  for instance of such under ly ing units as Actor,Instrument,  etc.
are needed <Instrumenta l  case - ps~t ep_~,  prepos-i t ional  phrase n__aa + Loc - ps~t na psacfm stro~i, pomocf + Gen - p~e-lo~it pomqqf slovn/ku, etc., i.e.
wr i te  wi th  a pen, wr i te  on a type-writer,  t rans late  by means of a d ict ionary,  respect ive ly ,  al l  corres-pond to Instrument>.The next step cons ists  in the procedure of morphemic  synthesis(see Weishe i te lov~,  1979) .This  procedure  is adapted to the purposesof pract ica l  projects,  so that a d i rect  t rans i t ion  to graphemics  isat tempted at.
Here the st ructura l  order  is no more needed and the re-p resentat ion  of word forms prov ided wi th  in format ion on the morphemesinc luded can be submitted to the procedure of the combinat ion  of lex-ical stem <and, as the case may be, its a l ternat ions> with endings tocreate a correct  sequence of Czech word forms cor respond ing  to themeaning represented in the TR with which  the whole  procedure  of trans-duct ion  started.6.
Some tectogrammat ica l  representat ions  of Czech sentencesthat were a l ready ga ined as a resu l t  of the funct ion ing of the proced-ure of random generat ion  at the computer  EC 1040 can serve as i l lustr -ations.
Most  of them are correct  f rom the grammat ica l  point  of view,though their mean ingfu lness  can of ten be doubted;  however,  the con-straints on the semantic compat ib i l i ty  of lexical  units are - in ourop in ion  - a mat ter  reaching beyond the l inguist ic  competence as such.The quest ions  of the  boundary  between these semant ic  se lect ion re-str ict ions and the grammat ica l  condi t ions  on str ict  subcategor i zat ionare by far not clear; this can be i l lust rated by the fo l l~wing examp-les the under ly ing trees cor respond ing  to which  were der ived by oursystem dur ing the f i rst  exper iments:N~co cht~lo mft  K ladno.
-  Something wanted to have (the town of}Kladno.Pr~v~ n~co t~ i lo  ka~d4ho mu~e.

- We have expanded a hol iday.Co byla pam~{ spodem?
- What was the memory  from the bottom?Each of these sentences seems to be connected with specif ic  e\[~piricalproblems concern ing the ment ioned  boundary,  and thus also the bounda-ry between the system of language and the domain of cognit ion.
Need-less to say, c lear ly  acceptab le  sentences were derived, too, by oursystem, such as:Ka~d4 ~ena vyr~b~la  n~ky .

- The gent leman manufactured  leaves.The system of programmes for the t ransduct ive  components  is ex-t remely complex and due to this fact the l ink ing of its part ia l  nro ~grammes <procedures  and subprocedures)  for indiv idual  automata is ad i f f i cu l t  task from the point  of v iew of computer  storace and of thehuman work concern ing the debugging of the programmes.
