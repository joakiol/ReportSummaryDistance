Tagging Gene and Protein Names in Full Text ArticlesLorraine Tanabe and W. John WilburNational Center for Biotechnology InformationNLM, NIHBethesda, Maryland 20894AbstractCurrent information extraction effortsin the biomedical domain tend tofocus on finding entities and facts instructured databases or MEDLINE?abstracts.
We apply a gene andprotein name tagger trained onMedline abstracts (ABGene) to arandomly selected set of full textjournal articles in the biomedicaldomain.
We show the effect ofadaptations made in response to thegreater heterogeneity of full text.1 IntroductionThe application of large-scale genomics andproteomics technologies towards a wide varietyof biological questions has resulted in acontinuous stream of information regardingthousands of genes and gene products into theMedline database of biomedical abstracts.
Thisrepository has been recognized as a richknowledge source for biological informationretrieval, information extraction and text mining.However, abbreviated scientific abstracts cannotcontain the same volume of information as thefull text articles that they represent.
It wasrecently shown that only 30% of proteininteractions contained in the Dictionary ofInteracting Proteins (DIP) (Xenarios et al,2000) could be found in Medline sentencescontaining DIP protein pairs (Blaschke et al,2000).
This finding suggests that currentinformation extraction efforts being applied tobiomedical abstracts should be extended to fulltext databases.The basic task of identifying gene andprotein names is a necessary first step towardsmaking full use of the information encoded inbiomedical text.
This remains a challengingtask due to the irregularities and ambiguities ingene and protein nomenclature.
Theirregularities are mainly the result of a lack ofnaming conventions, as well as the widespreadpractice of using many synonyms for one geneor protein.
A glance at the Nomenclaturesection of the Nature Genetics website(http://www.nature.com/ng/web_specials/nomen/) shows the scope of the problem, as well asideas for addressing it.
The nomenclatureguidelines implore authors to consult relevantnomenclature committees before announcingnew genes, and to provide synonyms for genesin abstracts.
Additional rules specify that:4.
Gene symbols are always italicisedand never contain hyphens, greekletters, roman numerals, subscripts orsuperscripts.5.
All letters in human genes are upper-case?all letters in mouse genes arelower-case?Unfortunately, we are currently at a stagewhere these types of rules are not consistentlyapplied to most biomedical abstracts, let alne tofull text documents.
Until the biomedicalcommunity adheres uniformly to nomenclatureguidelines, ambiguities regarding gene/proteinnames will continue to be an obstacle for naturallanguage processing of biomedical text.
Theseambiguities become apparent at themorphological, syntactic and semantic levels.For example,  caco-2 refers to a cell line, butpai-1 is a gene name.
Gene and protein namescan contain verbs and other parts of speech thatare hard to distinguish from the surroundingtext, as in deleted in azoospermia-like, son ofsevenless, ran, man, young arrest and never inmitosis.
Genes can be transfected into cells, orcombined with chemicals, resulting inambiguous terms like CHO-A(3) andca2+/calmodulin.
The semantic notion of a geneor protein is quite arbitrary ?
isACTTGGAATGACC a gene name?
In additionto sequences, there are mutations, motifs,receptors, antibodies, hormones, channels,Association for Computational Linguistics.the Biomedical Domain, Philadelphia, July 2002, pp.

The domain-specific irregularities andambiguities just described are superimposedupon the ambiguities in the natural languageitself, so it is not surprising that theidentification of gene and protein names inbiomedical text remains a difficult andchallenging task.
The methodologies applied tothis fundamental problem include rule-basedand/or pattern matching methods (Fukuda et al,1998) (Thomas et al, 2000) (Yoshida et al,2000) (Jenssen et al, 2001) (Ono et al, 2001)(Yu at al, 2002) (Bunescu et al, 2002), amodified BLAST algorithm (Krauthammer etal., 2000), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)(Collier et al, 2000) (Proux et al, 1998), NaiveBayes and decision trees (Nobata et al, 1999),under specified parsing with knowledge sources(Rindflesch et al 2000), and context-freegrammars (Gaizauskas, 2000).In this paper, we evaluate the application of agene and protein name tagger trained onMedline abstracts (ABGene) (Tanabe andWilbur, 2002) to a randomly selected set of1,000 PUBMEDCENTRAL?
(PMC) articles.PMC is a digital archive of full text peer-reviewed biomedical articles launched inFebruary 2000 by the National Center forBiotechnology Information (NCBI) and the U.S.National Library of Medicine (NLM?)
(Robertset al, 2001).
We present two adaptations madein response to the greater heterogeneity of fulltext, and evaluate how they affect theperformance of ABGene on a test set of 2600full text sentences.2 MethodsWe first give an overview of ABGene?smethod for extracting gene and protein namesfrom biomedical citations, and then presentsome modifications to ABGene designed toimprove its performance on full text articles.2.1 ABGene OverviewWe previously trained the Brill POS tagger(Brill, 1994) to recognize protein and genenames in biomedical text using a training set of7,000 Medline sentences.
We updated thelexicon included in the Brill package (BrownCorpus plus Wall Street Journal corpus) withentries from the UMLS?
SPECIALIST lexicon(McCray et al 1994, Humphreys et al 1998),and generated a list of bigrams and a word listfrom all of MEDLINE to customize the trainingfor our purposes.
ABGene processing begins byusing these automatically generated rules fromthe Brill tagger to extract single word gene andprotein names from biomedical abstracts (seeTable 1).This is followed by extensive filtering for falsepositives and false negatives.
A key step duringthe filtering stage is the extraction of multi-wordgene and protein names that are prevalent in theliterature but inaccessible to the Brill tagger.During the false positive filtering step, theGENE tag is removed from a word if it matchesa term from a list of 1,505 precompiled generalbiological terms (acids, antagonist, assembly,antigen, etc.
), 39 amino acid names, 233restriction enzymes, 593 cell lines, 63,698organism names from the NCBI TaxonomyLexical Rule DescriptionNNP gene fgoodleftGENEChange the tag of a wordfrom NNP to GENE if theword gene can appear to theright-A hassuf 2 GENEChange the tag of a wordfrom anything to GENE if itcontains the suffix -Ac- haspref 2 GENEChange the tag of a wordfrom anything to GENE if itcontains the prefix c-GENE cellfgoodright NNPChange the tag of a wordfrom GENE to NNP if theword cell can appear to theleftContextual Rule DescriptionNNP GENEPREV1OR2WDgenesChange the tag of a wordfrom NNP to GENE if oneof the two preceding wordsis genesNNP GENENEXTBIGRAM (GENEChange the tag of a wordfrom NNP to GENE if thetwo following words aretagged ( and GENECD GENESURROUNDTAGCC )Change the tag of a wordfrom CD to GENE if thepreceding word is taggedCC and the following wordis tagged )VBG JJ NEXTTAGGENEChange the tag of a wordfrom VBG to JJ if the nextword is tagged GENETable 1.
Examples of lexical and contextual rules learned bythe Brill tagger.
NNP = proper noun, CD = cardinal number,CC = coordinating conjunction, JJ = adjective, VBG = verb,gerund/present participleDatabase (Wheeler et al 2000) or 4,357 non-biological terms.
Non-biological terms wereobtained by comparing word frequencies inMEDLINE versus the Wall Street Journal (WSJ)using the following expression, where p is theprobability of occurrence:log(p(word occurs in MEDLINE)/ p(word occurs in WSJ) )< 1Additional false positives are found by regularexpressions including numbers followed bymeasurements (25 mg/ml) and common drugsuffixes (-ole, -ane, -ate, -ide, -ine, -ite, -ol, -ose,cooh).The false negative filter recovers a singleword name if it: 1) matches a list of 34,555single word names and 7611 compound wordnames compiled from LocusLink (Pruitt &Maglott 2001) and the Gene OntologyConsortium (2000) (Wain et al, 2002) andcontains a good context word before or after thename, or 2) contains a low frequency trigramand a good context word before or after thename.
The context words were automaticallygenerated by a probabilistic algorithm, using theLocusLink/Gene Ontology set and a largecollection of texts in which these gene namesoccur.
We computed a log odds score orBayesian weight for all non-gene name wordsindicating their propensity to predict an adjacentgene name in the texts.Compound word names are recovered usingterms that occur frequently in known genenames.
Recombination of these terms producecompound words that also tend to begene/protein names.
These terms include thedigits 1-9, the letters a-z, the roman numerals,the Greek letters, functional descriptors(adhesion), organism identifiers (hamster),activity descriptors (promoting), placementindicators (early), and generic descriptors(light).
In addition to the 415 exact terms, weadded regular expressions that allow for partialmatches or special patterns such as wordswithout vowels, words with numbers and letters,words in capital letters, and common prefixesand suffixes (-gene, -like, -ase).Finally, Bayesian learning (Langley 1996,Mitchell 1997, Wilbur 2000) is applied to rankdocuments by similarity to documents withknown gene/protein names.
Documents below acertain threshold are considered to have nogene/protein names in them.2.2 Modifications for Full Text ArticlesThe full text PMC articles are longer thanabstracts, and contain extraneous informationlike grant numbers and laboratory reagents,along with figures and tables.
An attempt totake windows of varying sizes of the full text inorder to rank the windows by similarity toabstracts with known gene names wasunsuccessful.
High scoring windows often hidfalse positives, and low scoring windows couldcontain gene and protein name contextsinfrequently encountered in Medline abstracts.However, we determined that the classifiercould be used on the sentence level for full textarticles, and show the effect of an assumptionthat sentences below a zero threshold do notcontain gene/protein names.We tried to increase the performance ofABGene on the PMC articles by adding a finalprocessing step.
We ran ABGene on 2.16million Medline abstracts similar to documentswith known gene names, and extracted 2.42million unique gene/protein names.
We countedthe number of times each unique name wasgiven the GENE tag by ABGene in the 2.16million abstracts, and  then extracted threegroups of putative gene/protein names from thislarge set, with count thresholds at 10 (134,809names), 100 (13,865 names) and 1000 (1136names).During the final stage of processing, terms insentences with scores greater than 2 are checkedagainst these lists of supposed gene/proteinnames.
We show the effect of tagging termswith counts of at least 10, 100 and 1000 in theputative gene/protein list.3 Experiment and ResultsWe evaluated the performance of ABGeneon 2600 PMC sentences from 13 score levelsranging from ?8 to 60+.
No attempt was madeto narrow the set using query terms.
Thesentences were selected as follows:  half of thetest set consists of the first 100 sentences fromeach score level, and the other half consists of100 sentences selected at random from eachscore level.
Precision and recall results areshown for each individual score range in Table2, and cumulative results are shown in Table 3.The number of words tested varies for eachscore level because longer sentences tend tohave higher scores.
Also, sentences with scoresnear zero tend to be table or figure entries, withonly a few words each.Table 2.
Precision and recall for each score range.
TP+FN = number of gene names; P = precision without final step, R = recall withoutfinal step, P 1000 = precision with 1000 count threshold at final step, R 1000 = recall with 1000 count threshold at final step, P 100 =precision with 100 count threshold at final step, R 100 = recall with 100 count threshold at final step, P 10 = precision with 10 countthreshold at final step, R 10 = recall with 10 count threshold at final step.Table 3.
Cumulative precision and recall using the score as a lower threshold.3.1 Problematic Areas in Full TextThe false positive gene/protein names found inthe PMC articles reveal new difficulties for thebasic task of identifying gene and protein namesin biomedical text.
For example, in abstracts,entities like restriction enzyme sites, laboratoryprotocol kits, primers, vectors, molecularbiology supply companies and chemicalreagents are usually scarce.
However, in themethods section of a full document, they appearregularly, adding to the morphological, syntacticand semantic ambiguities previously mentioned.Illustrative examples include bio-rad, centricon-30 spin, xbai sites, mg2, geneamp and pgem3z.A significant source of false negatives consistsof tables and figures from full text, whichcompletely lack contextual cues and/or indicatorwords.
These problems can be addressed byeliminating processing of materials and methodssections, tables and figures.
Another significantsource of false negatives is an artifact of thePMC format, for example, beta is translated to[beta], thus a name like beta1 integrin becomes[beta]1 integrin in PMC.
This is easilyaddressed by removing the PMC formattingprior to processing, and has already beencompleted for future work on PMC articles.4 ConclusionWe conclude that an information extractionsystem to tag gene and protein names inMedline abstracts (ABGene) can be applied tofull text articles in the biomedical domain.

We arecurrently exploring methods to filter the 2.16million putative gene/protein names extractedfrom Medline using our system.
The resultingset of gene/protein names, a significant additionto the 42K names available from the GeneOntology Consortium and LocusLink, will beused to improve the performance of textprocessing on full text articles in the biomedicaldomain.ReferencesBlaschke, C. and Valencia, A.
