Coling 2008: Proceedings of the workshop on Speech Processing for Safety Critical Translation and Pervasive Applications, pages 17?23Manchester, August 2008Economical Global Access to a VoiceXML GatewayUsing Open Source TechnologiesKulwinder Singh, Dong-Won ParkDept of Information & Communications EngineeringPaiChai University, Daejeon, South Korea{singh, dwpark}@pcu.ac.krAbstractVoice over IP and the open source technologies arebecoming popular choices for organizations.However, while accessing the VoiceXML gatewaysthese systems fail to attract the global userseconomically.
The objective of this paper is todemonstrate how an existing web application can bemodified using VoiceXML to enable non-visualaccess from any phone.
Moreover, we unleash a wayfor linking an existing PSTN-based phone line to aVoiceXML gateway even though the voice serviceprovider (VSP) does not provide a localgeographical number to global customers to accessthe application.
In addition, we introduce aneconomical way for small sized businesses toovercome the high cost of setting up and using acommercial VoiceXML gateway.
The method isbased on Asterisk server.
In order to elucidate theentire process, we present a sample PackageTracking System application, which is based on anexisting website and provides the same functionalityas the website does.
We also present an onlinedemonstration, which provides global access tocommercial voice platforms (i.e.
Voxeo, TellmeStudio, Bevocal and DemandVoice).
This paper alsodiscusses various scenarios in which spokeninteraction can play a significant role.1    IntroductionThe end of the 20th century witnesses an explosive growth inInternet usage.
We have seen an explosion in the number ofbrowser-based visual applications, from the broad exampleswe use every day, such as e-commerce, movie or flightschedules, and financial information.
The most commonmeans for accessing information residing on many websitesacross the globe is still the dominating interface of point andclick with a mouse using the graphical user interface (GUI).Additionally, telephone is also widely used to accessinformation.
Still, in densely populated countries it seems tobe difficult to handle large amounts of calls simultaneously,which leads to long call queues and frustrated customers.However, the challenge that is presented to the presentInternet world is to make the enormous web content2008.

Since speech is the most natural means ofcommunication, especially for these users, voice will be adominating mode in newly designed multi-modal (Oviatt,S.L., 1999) user interfaces for future devices.
This calls for arevolutionary design of a voice user interface (VUI) tosupplement the conventional GUIs.
Internet and telephonyused to be two separate technologies to build applicationsaccessible over the phone.
VoiceXML bridges the gap; itleverages the existing web infrastructure and enables webdevelopers to build voice-enabled web applicationsaccessible from any telephone, by anyone, anywhere,anytime.
A major advantage of VoiceXML is that it providesweb content over a simple telephone device, making itpossible to access an application even without a computerand an Internet connection.
VoiceXML finds readyacceptance in the business world due to the followingreasons.Providing a voice-based interface with the web interface isan advantage to the visually challenged who are unable to usea visual interface.
It is also possible to use the application foraccessing a web-based interface even while on the movethrough a mobile phone, which is much easier to carryaround than a personal computer.
Phone applications aremore spontaneous.
Most people these days always have theirphone on their hip.
In many cases, the phone transaction canbe completed before the PC even boots or you can log in.Lastly, there is no possibility of a virus from a phone call andit is typically much more secure.The number of telephone users is far greater than thenumber of people who use personal computers or theInternet.Thus, by using VoiceXML applications, we can reach outto more customers than is possible by using the Internet.Voice portals put all kinds of information at a consumer'sfingertips anytime, anywhere.
Customers just dial into thevoice portal's 800 number and use simple voice commands toaccess whatever information they need.
It's quick, easy, andeffective, even from a car or the airport.
However, it still failsto attract the huge global customers as they have to pay thelong distance calling charge to access the information.
Hence,this paper is an attempt to peep behind the curtain andanalyze the market trends and thereby proposes a solution toresolve the current issues and satisfy the global customers byproviding them a solution to access the VoiceXML gatewayeconomically.
The structure of this paper is as follows.
In the17next section we present the voice hosting infrastructure.
Wethen discuss our experimental results and finally conclude bypresenting the scenario for using Voice User Interfacingfollowed by the summary of the outcome.2    Voice Hosting InfrastructureA voice hosting infrastructure requires many interlockingcomponents such as telephony hardware, software: TTS (textto speech, ASR (automatic speech recognition), networkingtechnology, monitoring and administrative services.
Wediscuss all the essential elements bellow.2.1    LinkingMost of the VoiceXML gateways (Ruiz, Q. Sanchez, M.2003) can operate VoiceXML speech applications on anystandard web server and can support both static and dynamiccontent, and provide a high degree of scalability andplatform-independence.
Also, voice applications can beseamlessly integrated into existing enterprise web and ITinfrastructure.
There are two ways to accomplish the task:-Link your existing web server with VSP?s voicegateways.-Port your web applications to VSP?s web server.Linking an existing web application with VoiceXMLgateways is fairly straightforward.
As you see in figure 1,when a VoiceXML gateway receives a phone call, it looks atthe number dialed to lookup the URL of the web server, thensends the HTTP request.
You need to provide the URL ofyour web server to VSP.
One VSP provides Web-based GUIfor linking an application as shown in Figure 1.There may be some changes required to your Web serverbefore you connect with your VSP.
Changes vary from VSPto VSP, or depending on your service provider and type ofWeb server.
As an example, our application residing on anApache HTTP Server, according to Bevocal, must modify thehttpd.conf file to add the new MIME type in the followingway.# AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration.# file mime.types for specific file types.# MIME types for VoiceXML-related content.AddType application/voicexml+xml                                .vxmlAddType application/srgs                                               .gram .srgsAddType application/srgs+xml                                       .grxmlAddType application/x-nuance-gsl                                 .gsl .grammarAddType application/x-nuance-dynagram-binary          .ngo.2.2    MappingSpeech-enabled Internet portals, or voice portals, are quicklybecoming the hottest trend in e-commerce-broadening accessto Internet content to everyone with the most universalcommunications device of all, the telephone.
Currently,voice hosting providers set up local toll free numbers or DID(direct inward dialing) numbers in order to access voiceapplications through their VoiceXML gateways.
If the VSP isunable to provide the local DID numbers in the desiredcountry, the users from that country have to pay internationalcalling charges, which is sometimes quite expensive.
Wepropose our idea to resolve this issue as follows.SIP Mapping: It totally depends upon the telephonyinfrastructure of the VoiceXML gateway.
If it is asterisk-based (Meggelen, J. V. Madsen, L. Smith J.
2007) then thejob is fairly easy, otherwise it could be a tedious task toconfigure a VoiceXML gateway with a remote telephonynetwork.
Our proposed idea is independent of any kind oftelephony infrastructure, provided it supports SIP signaling.IP-PBX(Asterisk/Elastix/Trixbox)AnalogPCI card PSTNFigure 1.
Linking a web server with a VoiceXML gatewayDatabaseWebServerPSTNInternethttpVoiceXMLGateway inUSADemandVoice TelephonyTTS/ASRLocal Telco inUSALocal Telcosomewhere elsein the worldInternetENUMDNShttp://www.yourdomain.com/index.vxml18The most promising way to connect a VoiceXML gatewaywith a third party's Asterisk server (any IP-PBX) is to use theENUM service.
In order to use ENUM DNS efficiently, thereare few steps needed to be followed.
First of all, at e164.org(Ruiz, Q. Sanchez, M. 2003), in the ENUM database, weneed to register the IP address and DID number, which islanding on your SIP extension of VoiceXML Gateway, asdepicted in the figure 2.Figure 2.
ENUM RegistrationAfter editing the ENUM (tElephone NUmber Mapping)entry, we set up the ENUM trunk and outbound route on theremote IP-PBX machine.We are running Elastix IP-PBX (elastix.org) on the remoteside because it is easy to manage the configuration throughGUI on Elastix.
Moreover, it is an open source technology,and comes with a self-installing package that installs acomplete operating system, Asterisk PBX, FreePBX etc.9|.XXXXXXXXXXXXX (X matches any digit from 0 to 9)According to our dial plan shown above, let?s assume thatwe need to dial the American DID number 641-543-6745,and dialing pattern would be like: 916415436745.Our DID number 641-543-6745 is registered at e164.org.This means that when someone calls the DID, the call willland on the SIP number instead of DID number, as thee164.org DNS zone will provide the IP addressing andprotocol information needed to connect to your VoiceXMLgateway .
In other words, the call will not go over the DIDprovider?s network (see figure 3).There would be a native or Packet2Packet SIP bridgingbetween the VoiceXML gateway and remote IP-PBX.Ultimately, VSP and remote client will not pay any toll toPSTN operator or ITSP (Internet Telephony ServiceProvider) because the call bypasses their network.
Moreover,the VSP does not need to open all the credentials oftelephony setup of the VoiceXML gateway.
So, most of theinformation will be isolated from the remote client.
This isattractive to the VSP that does not want to register the sipnumber and IP address of the gateway in the ENUM(tElephone NUmber Mapping) database, (because somepeople are afraid to disclose their IP addresses to others).Moreover, they do not want to accept anonymous SIP calls,and want to run their own IP-PBX instead of using client?sIP-PBX.
In that case, we propose a very easy solution to setup the SIP extension on the VoiceXMLCollect Digits >> 916415436745Apply Dialplan>>9|.XXXXXXXXXXXXXClient side                 (remote ip-pbx)VSP sideFigure 3.
Flow chart of the call logicgateway and configure it on the remote IP-PBX in the customextension as shown in figure 4.Figure 4.
Custom extension settingsOur IP-PBX is connected with Bevocal, Tellme Studio,Voxeo and DemandVoice.
So, our Device Options look likeas followsSIP/8773386225@voip.cafe.bevocal.comSIP/8005558965@sip.studio.tellme.comBoth of the above mentioned methods are really good if VSPdoes not want to use a remote IP-PBX for outbound calls.On the contrary, when VSP wants to setup outbound calls onthe remote machine, we propose another idea to accomplishthe task.
Fortunately, this is very easy to configure theSIP ExtensionIP or domain name of a VoiceXMLgatewayDID number E.164 Number>> search DB for16415436745SIP URI FOUND?Call via SIP PSTN /ITSPAllowed?Call viaPSTN/ITSPnoyesReject Call InternetVoiceXMLGatewayPSTNyesnoIncoming DID19machines on both sides, if a telephony infrastructure uses anasterisk-based PBX on both ends.In this scenario, we can register the machines with each otherusing username and secret or we can use IP-basedauthentication without registering with each other.
Actually,it is very easy on Elastix because it uses a Freepbx forconfiguring most of the tasks of Asterisk server.In other words, it?s becoming less and less common to havestatic IP addresses.
So, if you have a dynamic IP address it isgood to go with username and secret.
Typically, we have todeal with sip.conf and extensions.conf on Asterisk, providedyou use sip protocol.
For a sample configuration code(Meggelen, J. V. Madsen, L. Smith J.
2007) see subsectionDID Mapping.DID Mapping: We have two scenarios to deal with: a)When a VoiceXML gateway does not support SIP signaling.b) When VSP wants to land the calls only on a DID numberassigned for your application execution.First, if it is a toll free DID number then the remote clientcan dial through ENUM in order to connect with a toll freegateway, and call will land on the toll free network, which isconnected with a VoiceXML gateway (see figure 5).
It meansa toll free subscriber has to pay for it, and the call between aremote IP-PBX and the toll free gateway would be free,because it will go over the internet.Figure 5.
Remote toll free connectivityFor example, we connect DemandVoice?s voice gatewayusing a toll free DID number remotely as follows:Set up the custom extension as we discussed in subsectionSIP Mapping , and it will directly connect with a toll freegateway (see figure 6).SIP/8008042865@sip.tollfreegateway.comOr you can dial through ENUM as we discussed insubsection SIP Mapping.If it is a DID number and has no registration in the ENUMdatabase then you need to originate the call using your ITSP,and the call will directly land on your DID assigned for yourapplication by VSP.
With the advent of VOIP technology,Figure6.
Asterisk CLIthere has been a flood of ITSP (Internet Telephony ServiceProvider) all over the world.
It is really hard to choose one.We have tested the following configuration using our StaticIP address on Elastix with VTWhite (Internet TelephonyService Provider) for VOIP termination and origination.Peer Details:allow=ulawcanreinvite=nocontext=from-pstndisallow=alldtmf=rfc2833dtmfmode=rfc2833host=sip.vtwhite.cominsecure=verynat=yesqualify=yessendrpid=yestype=peerSince our IP address is registered with VTWhite.com,there is no need for more typical authentication orregistration parameters.Inbound Routes:DID number:  1XXXXXXXXX (11 digits)Set destination for incoming calls landing on your DID.
Ifyou are dialing out through VTWhite you must set youroutbound CID as follows:"1XXX-XXX-XXXX"<1XXXXXXXXXX>We have tested the following configuration withvoiptalk.org (Internet Telephony Service Provider) usingusername and secret.Peers Details:host=voiptalk.orginsecure=verysecret=XXXXtype=peerusername=XXXXusername:secret@voiptalk.org/username2.3    PortingMany organizations have their existing toll free phonenumbers, and they want to connect their existing numberswith a voice portal, and don?t like to get a new phonenumber.
Luckily, it is very easy in the United States to portthe number from one carrier to another carrier.
There areRemoteIP-PBXIncoming DID numberInternetToll freegatewayENUMIncoming toll free DIDVoiceXMLGatewayin U.S.ADemandVoice20many independent ?RESPORG?
(RESPonsibleORGanization) companies, which help for porting thenumbers.If there are issues for porting the existing number, wepropose a very simple idea to install an asterisk-based IP-PBX at your premises and route the calls landing on yourexisting number to VoiceXML gateway using a sip or ITSPas we have discussed in section 2.2 Mapping.2.4    EditingAdding VoiceXML interface (Tsai, M.-J.
2005) (Kenneth, R.A. 2001) (Yankelovich, N., 2000) to web contents presentsunique challenges to designers.
Complexity depends upon theweb application?s architecture.
In this section, wedemonstrate how to modify an existing package tracking website powered by a relational database.
We use PHP, MySQL,Apache web server, and these tools are widely used in webapplications development, because these are cross-platformand open source technologies.
There are a couple of ways toadd voice user interfacing (VUI).
It is possible to addVoiceXML tags either on the fly when the VoiceXMLinterpreter extracts the contents from the web server or inother case tags can be embedded into an existing web page.However, we concentrate only on the latter case.
First of alllet?s have a look on a web application (see figure 7)(Tracking number: 6754356786).
This application isavailable on the following URL for demonstrating the task.http://biometrics.pcu.ac.kr/demo/search1.phpFigure 7.
WEB-GUI   for tracking the packageFigure 8.
Call flow diagram for a VUI designWe design the call flow diagram (see figure 8) of thepackage tracking application as follows: According to ourflow chart we need to make two VoiceXML documents.Before adding the VoiceXML tags into your webpage youmust check with your VSP how to specify the document typedefinition (DTD) in your VoiceXML documents.
Since ourapplication is linked with Bevocal platform (BeVocal Caf?,2007), we do the following way.Collecting the Tracking number-Voicexml Document-1(index.vxml) (see Appendix A).Tracking Report-Voicexml Document-2 (track.php)(see Appendix B).Table 1.

Weprovide PSTN numbers from 40 courtiers to access theVoiceXML gateway of Bevocal, Tellme Studio,DemandVoice and Voxeo.

User can also call our application from thefollowing numbers without dialing any pin or extensionnumbers.Direct Numbers:Italy       Rome       06 916507970United Kingdom  Leeds       0113 350 8176United Kingdom  Manchester     0161 660 4556United States   Bellevue      1 425 998 0503To verify the performance of our proposed idea, weimplemented an IP-PBX, an automated package tracker andthe business listing search using VoiceXML, PHP, andMySQL.
Then, we linked remotely with various VoiceXMLgateways, and tried to call the application using differentcodecs (ulaw, g729, gsm).
We found that ulaw codec is muchbetter for interacting with the ASR engine, and also itprovides the best voice quality since it uses no compression.This means that it has the lowest latency and the highestMOS (Mean Opinion Score) because there are no additionalprocessing delays.
However, it requires high bandwidth, andthis can be easily managed via proper network provisioning.The compression has very adverse affect on speechrecognition when it comes to deal with the ASR engine.
Themore compression is used, the more characters will be lost.Fortunately, ulaw is immune to this effect.
Table 2 shows thecall volume according to bandwidth and codec.
Table 3shows the hardware and software specifications.We will try to keep alive these Geographical Distributednumbers for public use.
Developers and researchers can testtheir applications by paying just local charges applied by theterminating PSTN operator.3.
Scenarios for Using Voice User InterfacingDespite the availability of various media of communicationutilized in human computer interaction, people tend to preferthe more social medium of communication such as voice.With the advent of the Internet, the PC has become the mostpreferred device which people turn to when they need toenquire for information.
On the interaction side, thetelephone seems to remain the best example for usabilitypreferred by the various classes of users.
So, to power ofvoice communication, with the richness of the Internet onone side, and the usability of the phone device on the otherside, we present various situations in which VUI can be ofgreat utility.Situations:?
Driving?
No internet service?
Visually Impaired persons?
Replacement of human operatorsVUI is the most time efficient modality for input, becausevoice input is nimbler than typing.
VUI can be used to checkand answer web emails while driving a vehicle.
Another classof situations is when there is no Internet or PC available andthe user needs to access web applications such internetbanking, parcel tracking, directory assistance, onlinereservation, order status enquiry, instant messaging,electronic voting, dating/chat services, and informationservices.
Moreover, visually impaired people can takeadvantage of the above mentioned services just over theregular phone.
Furthermore, in many situations costefficiency can be increased by replacing human operators incall centers and offices with a VoiceXML-based interactivevoice response system.4.

ConclusionIn this paper we have targeted the large number ofinternational users who are deprived of taking the advantageof using the toll free number remotely, and have introducedan economical way to access VoiceXML gateways globally.Moreover, our globally distributed PSTN numbers areavailable to access VoiceXML platform for only research,test and educational purpose.
We conclude that the callquality may differ depending upon the different feature sets(e.g., codecs) and network bandwidth available.
In order toget a nice connectivity with a VoiceXML gateway, the callshould pass through minimum VOIP gateways.
Currently, weare developing a virtual user agent based on ATOM/RSSprotocol, which can be accessed by phone globally foraccessing information.AppendixA   VoiceXML Document-1<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE vxml PUBLIC "-//BeVocal Inc//VoiceXML 2.0//EN""http://cafe.bevocal.com/libraries/dtd/vxml2-0-bevocal.dtd"><vxml version="2.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml"><form id="login"><field name="t_number" type="digits">22<prompt>Welcome to <emphasis>Department of Information andCommunication Engineering, PaiChaiUniversity, South Korea</emphasis>.This demo version of Parceltracking system is developed by<emphasis>Mr.
