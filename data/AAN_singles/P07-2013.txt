We believethat the extensive usage of such measures derivesalso from the availability of robust and freely avail-able software that allows to compute them (Pedersenet al, 2004, WordNet::Similarity).In Ponzetto & Strube (2006) and Strube &Ponzetto (2006) we proposed to take the Wikipediacategorization system as a semantic network whichserved as basis for computing the semantic related-ness of words.
In the following we present the APIwe used in our previous work, hoping that it will en-courage further research in NLP using Wikipedia1.2 Measures of Semantic RelatednessApproaches to measuring semantic relatedness thatuse lexical resources transform these resources intoa network or graph and compute relatedness usingpaths in it (see Budanitsky & Hirst (2006) for an ex-tensive review).
For instance, Rada et al (1989)traverse MeSH, a term hierarchy for indexing ar-ticles in Medline, and compute semantic related-ness straightforwardly in terms of the number ofedges between terms in the hierarchy.
Jarmasz &Szpakowicz (2003) use the same approach with Ro-get?s Thesauruswhile Hirst & St-Onge (1998) applya similar strategy to WordNet.1The software can be freely downloaded at http://www.eml-research.de/nlp/download/wikipediasimilarity.php.3 The Application Programming InterfaceThe API computes semantic relatedness by:1. taking a pair of words as input;2. retrieving the Wikipedia articles they refer to(via a disambiguation strategy based on the linkstructure of the articles);3. computing paths in the Wikipedia categoriza-tion graph between the categories the articles areassigned to;4. returning as output the set of paths found,scored according to some measure definition.The implementation includes path-length (Radaet al, 1989; Wu & Palmer, 1994; Leacock &Chodorow, 1998), information-content (Resnik,1995; Seco et al, 2004) and text-overlap (Lesk,1986; Banerjee & Pedersen, 2003) measures, as de-scribed in Strube & Ponzetto (2006).The API is built on top of several modules and canbe used for tasks other than Wikipedia-based relat-edness computation.
On a basic usage level, it can beused to retrieve Wikipedia articles by name, option-ally using disambiguation patterns, as well as to finda ranked set of articles satisfying a search query (viaintegration with the Lucene2 text search engine).Additionally, it provides functionality for visualiz-ing the computed paths along the Wikipedia cate-gorization graph as either Java Swing componentsor applets (see Figure 1), based on the JGraph li-brary3, and methods for computing centrality scoresof the Wikipedia categories using the PageRank al-gorithm (Brin & Page, 1998).
Finally, it currently2http://lucene.apache.org3http://www.jgraph.com49Figure 1: Shortest path between computer and key-board in the English Wikipedia.provides multilingual support for the English, Ger-man, French and Italian Wikipedias and can be eas-ily extended to other languages4.4 Software ArchitectureWikipedia is freely available for download, and canbe accessed using robust Open Source applications,e.g.
the MediaWiki software5, integrated within aLinux, Apache, MySQL and PHP (LAMP) softwarebundle.
The architecture of the API consists of thefollowing modules:1.
RDBMS: at the lowest level, the encyclopediacontent is stored in a relational database manage-ment system (e.g.
MySQL).2.
MediaWiki: a suite of PHP routines for interact-ing with the RDBMS.3.
WWW-Wikipedia Perl library6: responsible for4In contrast to WordNet::Similarity, which due to the struc-tural variations between the respective wordnets was reimple-mented for German by Gurevych & Niederlich (2005).5http://www.mediawiki.org6http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Wikipediaquerying MediaWiki, parsing and structuring thereturned encyclopedia pages.4.
XML-RPC server: an intermediate communica-tion layer between Java and the Perl routines.5.
Java wrapper library: provides a simple inter-face to create and access the encyclopedia pageobjects and compute the relatedness scores.The information flow of the API is summarized bythe sequence diagram in Figure 2.
The higher in-put/output layer the user interacts with is providedby a Java API from which Wikipedia can be queried.The Java library is responsible for issuing HTTP re-quests to an XML-RPC daemon which provides alayer for calling Perl routines from the Java API.Perl routines take care of the bulk of querying ency-clopedia entries to the MediaWiki software (whichin turn queries the database) and efficiently parsingthe text responses into structured objects.5 Using the APIThe API provides factory classes for queryingWikipedia, in order to retrieve encyclopedia entriesas well as relatedness scores for word pairs.
Inpractice, the Java library provides a simple pro-grammatic interface.
Users can accordingly ac-cess the library using only a few methods givenin the factory classes, e.g.
getPage(word)for retrieving Wikipedia articles titled word orgetRelatedness(word1,word2), for com-puting the relatedness between word1 and word2,and display(path) for displaying a path foundbetween two Wikipedia articles in the categorizationgraph.
Examples of programmatic usage of the APIare presented in Figure 3.
In addition, the softwaredistribution includes UNIX shell scripts to accessthe API interactively from a terminal, i.e.
it does notrequire any knowledge of Java.6 Application scenariosSemantic relatedness measures have proven use-ful in many NLP applications such as word sensedisambiguation (Kohomban & Lee, 2005; Patward-han et al, 2005), information retrieval (Finkelsteinet al, 2002), information extraction pattern induc-tion (Stevenson & Greenwood, 2005), interpretationof noun compounds (Kim & Baldwin, 2005), para-50:Websrver:MediaWik:Javwraperlibray:Wikpedia:XMLRPCdaemon:DatbseResultset1.RetriveWikpediactegorytre2.CreatcategorytreJavdatstructre3.Wikpediapgeslokuplop:foreachwordResultsetXMLRPCresponsePerlobjectWikmarkuptextPHArticleobject4.Relatdnescorecomputaion:SQLquery(categoriesandliks):HTPrequst:Perlmodulecal:HTPrequst:PHmodulecal:SQLquery(page):articlelokup:Creatgraphfromcategorytrequery:CategoryextractionadpathsearchFigure 2: API processing sequence diagram.
Wikipedia pages and relatedness measures are accessedthrough a Java API.
The wrapper communicates with a Perl library designed for Wikipedia access and pars-ing through an XML-RPC server.
WWW-Wikipedia in turn accesses the database where the encyclopediais stored by means of appropriate queries to MediaWiki.51// 1.

Our APIprovides a flexible tool to include such measuresinto existing NLP systems while using Wikipediaas a knowledge source.
Programmatic access to theencyclopedia makes also available in a straightfor-ward manner the large amount of structured text inWikipedia (e.g.
for building a language model), aswell as its rich internal link structure (e.g.
the linksbetween articles provide phrase clusters to be usedfor query expansion scenarios).Acknowledgements: This work has been fundedby the Klaus Tschira Foundation, Heidelberg, Ger-many.
