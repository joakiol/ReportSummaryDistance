Rob insonIn ternat iona l  Bus iness  Mach ines  Corporat ionThomas  J. Watson  Research  CenterYorktown Heights ,  New YorkABSTRACT Two methods  are  g iven for conver t ing  rammars  be-longing to d i f fe rent  sys tems.
One conver ts  a s~mple  (context - f ree)phrase  s t ruc ture  grammar  (SPG) into a cor respond ing  dependencygrammar  (DG); the other  conver ts  a DG into a cor respond ing  SPG.The s t ruc tures  ass igned  to a s t r ing  by a source  grammar  wi l l  cor -respond sys temat ica l ly ,  though asymmetr i ca l ly ,  to those ass ignedby the ta rget  g rammar  resu l t ing  f rom its convers ion .
Since bothsys tems are  wea ldy  equiva lent ,  generat ing  exact ly  the CF  lan -guages,  the methods  fac i l i ta te  exper imentat ion  with e i ther  notat ionin  dev is ing  ru les  for any CF  language or any CF  set  of s t r ings  de-s igned to undergo  subsequent  t rans format ion .A source  SPG is assumed to be of ' f in i te  degree with o r -dered  ru les  in which  only the in i t ia l  symbo l  is recurs ive .

Any context - f ree  language can be generated  by grammars  ofe i ther  s imp le  phrase  s t ruc ture  or  dependency sys tems.2.
For  any g iven  SPG, there  ex is ts  one or  more  DG over  thesame language al l  of whose s t ruc tures  cor respond sys temat i -ca l ly  to s t ruc tures  ass igned  to the same s t r ings  by the SPG ifand only i f  the SPG is of f in i te degree .3.
For  any g iven DG there  ex is ts  one or more  cor respond ing  SloG.4.
For  any g iven  DG there  ex is ts  a unique SPG of degree  i that iss t rong ly  equ iva lent  o it.Ga i fman \[4\] g ives  a very  genera l  method  for  const ruc t ingcor respond ing  DG f rom any SloG of f in i te degree ,  and a l so  a meth-od for  const ruc t ing  a unique SloG of degree  t f rom any DG.
Herewe give two methods  for  const ruc t ing  cor respond ing  Slog and DGthat d i f fer  f rom Ga i fman 's .
The f i r s t  app l ies  only to a more  re -s t r i c ted  set  of SI?G and leads  to reduced  DG, whereas  Ga~fman'smethod  tends to produce  DG with over lapp ing  categor ies  and super -f luous ru les  that may never  be used  to generate  any st r ing.
Thesecond a l lows const ruc t ion  of SPG of degree  greater  than i f romcer ta in  DG.
2A simplified sketch of the two methods follows.
Each re-writing rule is "augmented" by starring a category on the right.Each dependency rule is augmented by assigning a numerical coef-ficient to each dependent.
Figure 2 shows a possible augmentedlloroofs are given by Gai fman \[4\].
It is assumed that the Slog isnon-erasing and reduced; that is, no category is rewritten as null,and there are no superfluous categories or rules.2The second method was suggested by Kay's procedurefor con-structing lo-trees f rom D-trees \[7\].
More  precisely, an Slog ofdegree n > i may  be derived if, in the DG, some categoriesgovern two or more  dependents, and the left- or rightmost depen=dent itself governs dependents.fo rm of SPGI  on the left and a possible augmented fo rm of DGI  onthe right.
(Detailed consideration of the prob lem of augmentation@ill follow the sketch of the operations.)
These augmentationswere  deliberately chosen so that conversion of either g rammaruniquely produces the other.
Different augmentations produce dif-ferent results, although structures of the original g rammar  and ofthe grammar  der ived  f rom it  s t i l l  co r respond.SPGI  TS IRL  DGIS - -NP  Vim* S:V z V 2- - -N i.IVi* V (2N * iN)VP - - -V*  N1 m VP:V  i V i -~ V 0 N i N (ID *)NP~D N*  NP :N  i N 1 --- D O N O D (*)F igure  2The co lumns TS and IRL in F igure  2 represent  a Table  ofSubst i tutes  and an In termed ia te  Rule L is t .
In the convers ion  ofSPGi ,  the TS is const ruc ted ,  equat ing each category  on the left  ofa ru le  with a superscr ip ted  te rmina l  ca tegory .
The numer ica lsuperscr ip t  {hereaf ter  ca l led  the exponent) equals  the number  ofru les  t raced  through when t rac ing  by s ta r red  categor ies  be fore  as ta r red  te rmina l  ca tegory  is  reached,  and expresses  the d is tancebetween the te rmina l  ca tegory  and the category  for  which  i t  is asubst i tute.
In the IRL, the categor ies  occur r ing  in each ru le  of theSPG are  rep laced  by the i r  subst i tu tes  f rom TS.
Tak ing the f i r s tLRL ru le ,  const ruc t ion  of a dependency ru le  is  begun by rep lac ingthe ar row with parentheses  enc los ing  the subst i tute  categor ies  onthe r ight.
Thus f rom the f i r s t  IRL  ru le  in F igure  2 we obtainV 2 (Ni V~).
The construction of a dependency rule is continuedso long as the exponent of the starred category X~ is greater thanzero.
The next step is to search the IRL  for a rule with X s on theleft.
The categories on the right of the new rule are inserted inthe parentheses of the D rule under construction, in the positionof X~, but no new parentheses are added.
When the starred oc-currence is X~, it is replaced by *, all exponents are erased, andthe dependency ru le  is complete .
The process  is  repeated  for  newdependency ru les  unti l  a l l  IRL  ru les  a re  exhausted.We must  add rules to the constructed DG for any unstarredterminal category of the IRL.
The added rules assign no depen-dents and are of the form D(*).
The assignment rules are simplyt rans fer red ,  and s ince V is the subst i tute  for  the ax iom categoryS, it  is taken as the ax iom for  the DG.Going in the other direction f rom an augmented DGI  toSI : 'Gt ,  we f i r s t  ass ign  an  exponent  s to each  category ,  where  sequa ls  the  la rgest  coe f f i c ient  of any  dependent  of that  category .
I fa category  is  not  ass igned dependents ,  i t s  exponent  i s  zero .
Thef i r s t  ru le  of augmented  DGt  now appears  as  V z (ZN 1 * 1Nt ) .F rom th is  ru le  two  ru les  a re  const ructed  fo r  the  IRL ;  that  i s ,  thenumber  of IRL  ru les  const ructed  f rom each  ru le  of DGt  w i l l  beequa l  to  the  exponent  of the  governor .
The  f i r s t  ru le  so obta inedwr i tes  the  governor  w i th  i t s  exponent  on  the  le f t  of the  ar row.
A l lof i t s  dependents  whose  coef f i c ients  equa l  that  of the  exponent  a rewr i t ten  in  o rder  on  the  r ight ,  and  the  govern ing  category  w i th  i t sexponent  decreased  by  t i s  wr i t ten  w i th  the  *.
Thus  we obta inV z ~ N 1 Vt .

The  second ru le  is  obta ined  in  a s imi la r  fash ion ,w i th  the  exponent  of the  govern ing  category  d imin ished  by 1 y ie ld -ing  V t -~ V0 N1. '
The  process  is  repeated  unt i l  an  IRL  ru le  re -wr i t ing  some category  w i th  exponent  equa l  to 1 is  used ,  a f te r  wh ichthe  next  DG ru le  is  p rocessed ,  and  so  on  unt i l  a l l  DG ru les  a reexhausted .A t  th i s  po in t ,  the  * ' s  may be  erased  and,  except  fo r  cate -gory  labe ls ,  the  IRL  i s  exact ly  equ iva lent  to the  rewr i t ing  ru les  ofthe  or ig ina l  unaugmented  SPG.
The  on ly  funct ion  the  TS serves  i sto  reass ign  labe ls .
Ass ignment  ru les  a re  t rans fer red  and  the  sub-s t i tu te  fo r  the  ax iom of DGt  i s  added,  tSPGI  and DG1 are very simple, with no embeddings and nooptional rules.
More  complicated grammars  give rise to problemsof augmentation, especially for SPG.
Even  SPGI  poses a problem.Assume it had been augmented  by starring NP  in rule I and in ruleZ.
In that case, the same substitute, N Z, is assigned to both Sand VP, and the procedure produces a DG that is not even weaklyequivalent to the original.
Clearly some constraints must  be im-posed on augmentation and provision made for g rammars  in whichit may not be possible to avoid starring a category more  than once.S imi la r ly ,  assume that  some DG has  a ru le  of the  fo rmC (A B * D), and  that  th i s  i s  augmented  as  C ( tA  Z\]3 * tD) .
TheIRL  rules are:C z --, B C $C 1 ~ A C O D.But  now the  ru les  generate  the  sequence  \]3 A C D, wh ich  was  notgenerated  by  the  or ig ina l  ru le ,  and  do not  generate  A B C D, wh ichwas .
Th is  i s  remedied  by requ i r ing  that  i f  a coe f f i c ient  n has  beenass igned to  a dependent ,  no  h igher  number  i s  ass igned to any  de-pendent  wh ich  in tervenes  between i t  and  the  *.
We w i l l  a l so  re -qu i re  that  a t  leas t  one dependent  be  preceded by  t ,  and  if  any  de-pendent  i s  p receded by n > t ,  there  must  be  a t  leas t  one dependent1A l though grammars  w i th  on ly  one  ax iom are  i l l us t ra ted ,  g ram-mars  w i th  more  than  one  ax iom can  obv ious ly  be  hand led  as  we l l .preceded by n - i .
Th is  is  not  c ruc ia l ,  but  i t  avo ids  set t ing  up un-necessary ,  s ing le -branch ing  categor ies  in  the  der ived  $PG.
Notethat  i f  a l l  dependents  in  any  ru le  a re  preceded by  i ,  wh ich  i s  thesame as  not  augment ing  the DG at  a l l ,  the  resu l t ing  SPG wi l l  be  ofdegree  i ;  that  i s ,  each  ru le  of the  grammar  w i l l  conta in  a t  leas tone te rmina l  ca tegory  on the  r ight .
Th is  i s  equ iva lent  to Ga i fman 'sprocedure \[4\].Augmentat ion  of SPG is the more  difficult case.
Pr imar i lyit is the prob lem of constructing the TS in a finite number  of steps.For  ex~mple, if for S --- NP  VP  S the S is starred on the right,an infinite loop is created immediately.
This is easy to avoidwhen considering a single rule or a smal l  set of rules, but we  donot know in general whether some series of rule augmentat ionsmay not lead to the same situation.
Gai fman's  solution is to re-quire that the marked  category be of lesser degree than the cate-gory on the left, but this not only leads to a proliferation of cate-gories in the derived DG whenever  the SPG has more  than one re-writing rule for any of its categories, it prevents us f rom derivingthe simplest corresponding DG in some cases.
I On  the other hand,the method employed here will not work  unless some restrictionsare imposed on augmentat ion wh ich  also imply restrictions on thefo rm of the SPG in addition to the requi rement  of finite degree.
Itis not clear what  restrictions are min imal ly  necessary, but it issufficient to require, in addition to finiteness of degree, that therules of the SPG be ordered, so that in a developing derivation, ifrule n has been applied, no rule m,  m < n, need be applied there-after.
This is too restrictive, and does not allow for full recur-sion.
We may,  however,  allow a dummy symbol, S', to appear inany rule rewriting some X as a string containing some Y,S' ~ Y ~ X, where  S' is replaced after one application of the set ofrules by # S #, the axiom, so that the rules then reapply in linearorder.Any  $PG of finite degree with ordered rules providing forrecursive application in the manner  specified can be converted to acorresponding DG by the method given here.
The  base componentproposed by 2Chomsky \[3\] for transformational g rammar  is an SPGof this form.l"Simplest" with respect to process, number  of categories, andf reedom f rom the property of structure sensitivity.
See p. 14 ff.2Chomsky  does not explicitly require that if S' appears in rewritingX, some Y (S' ~ Y ~ X) appear in the rule also, but implicitly ob-serves the restriction.
A new grammar  for English by Rosenbaum\[10\] contains a rule NP  ~ NP  S' which does not observe it.
Thisis the only case known to me of an actual g rammar  for some!
'real" language that violates this restriction, and Rosenbaum doesnot claim any strong theoretical motivation for the rule in-question.Cf.
also Lees  \[8\], and the MITRE grammar  \[11\].We turn now to more  detailed consideration of augmentingand converting SPG subject to the above constraints.
While theconstraints insure that the SPG can be workably converted, somelinguistically significant problems arise if we  consider how to de-rive a simple DG, and it will be shown that under some conditionsthe derived DG will exhibit a feature not heretofore considered inthe  l i te ra ture ,  a feature  of  "s t ruc ture  sens i t i v i ty" .Method i.

The two X*'sare assigned different subscripts to avoid assigning the samesubstitutes for Y and Z with the consequent loss of essentialinformation.
We now have three varieties of X, namely:  X,XI, and X2, where  X is the unstarred variety, X I is themarked  constituent of Y, and X 2 of Z.
(If X does not occurunstarred, only X and X I are needed.)
If X is not a termi-nal category, there is a rule rewriting X.
Then  we must  add,beneath that rule, rules for rewriting X 1 and X 2.
IfX ~ U*  W, we  add X I ~ U I*  Wand X 2 -~ U2*  W.Now,  if U is not a terminal category, we  add rules for re-writing U I and U 2 beneath the rule rewriting U.
Thus  theprocess of adding rules is iterative, but it will eventually endwhen, in some lower rule, a terminal category is starred.Note that in some cases sub-subscripts are needed.

Moreover ,  inspec -t ion of p roposed  grammars ,  for  Eng l i sh  at least ,  ind icates  thatmost  of the i r  ru les  do conta in  unique categor ies  on the r ight.Return ing  now to SPG2, we see that it  is  s t ruc ture  f ree ,s ince  every  e lementary  rewr i t ing  ru le  for  every  category  X i con-ta ins  a s ing le  occur rence  of at leas t  one category  Yi on the r ightwhich  does not appear  e l sewhere  on the r ight ,  and is not the ax iom.Under  these  cond i t ions  we wi l l  say that Yi is a head for  ca tegoryX i and ca l l  a l l  such Y 's  head categor ies .
Examinat ion  shows thatthe s t ruc ture -sens i t i ve  proper ty  of DG2 arose  f rom the cho icesmade in augment ing  SPG2.
If only head categor ies  a re  marked ,  as t ruc ture - f ree  DG s imi la r  to DGi  resu l t s ,  in which  a l l  s igns ofaugmentat ion  can be erased  without  a l te r ing  i ts generat ive  capaci ty .In tu i t ive ly ,  it seems reasonab le  to regard  heads  as sourcesof a "governor"  in any s t r ing  der ivab le  f rom the category  in whoserewr i t ing  ru les  they appear .
Th is  does not mean that the s t r ing  isto be cons idered  endocent r i c  in the s t rong  sense  of requ i r ing  thatthe governor  be subst i tu tab le  for  the ent i re  s t r ing  without  loss  ofg rammat ica l i ty ,  and the ob ject ion  somet imes  ra i sed  that  dependen-cy theory  fo rces  a pure ly  endocent r i c  ana lys i s  of a language isbased  on fa i lu re  to d i s t ingu ish  between "head  o.P' and "subst i tu tab lefo r " .
It appears  t ruer  to say that dependency ana lys i s  assumesthat one phrase  type is d i s t ingu ished  f rom another  p r imar i l y  by thes ingu lar  p resence  of some category  in it  ra ther  than by co -occur -rence  and order  of ca tegor ies  in it.Inc identa l ly ,  as ide  f rom the prob lem of obtain ing a s t ruc -tu re - f ree  DG f rom an SPG, avo idance  of s t ruc ture  sens i t i v i ty  maybe a c r i te r ion  for  ass ign ing  government  when one is ana lyz ing  alanguage in te rms of dependency  theory.
In Eng l i sh ,  fo r  example ,the cho ice  has genera l ly  wavered  between noun and verb  as cand i -dates  for  sentence  government .
S ince every  e lementary  sentencecontains one verb  but may conta in  severa l  nouns,  choos ing the nounfo rces  a s t ruc ture -sens i t i ve  DG.In conver t ing  a DG to  an  SPG, no requ i rement  of in t r ins ict6order ing  needs  to be  imposed on  the  dependency  ru les ,  as  i t  wason  the  rewr i t ing  ru les  of SPG.
Dependency  ru les  may a lways  hepar t ia l l y  o rdered  by  s tar t ing  w i th  the  ru le  (o r  ru les )  fo r  the  ax i -om(s ) .
Ca l l  these  " leve l  zero  ru les" .

To insure  eventua l  te rminat ion ,  how-ever ,  i t  i s  requ i red  that  i f  X occurs  anywhere  in  a leve l  n ru le ,and  i s  a dependent  in  a leve l  m ru le ,  m > n, then  i t s  cho ice  as?

I t  has  beenshown that rules like k (~) and A (B * C), occurring in structure-sensitive DG,  cannot be conflated.
Conflations of A (B $) withA (C * D) and of A (~ B) with A (B *) are also impossible, al-though structure sensitivity as defined above is not involved.
Ifthe rules are not conflatable because the DG is structure sensitive,then the SPG may also be structure sensitive.
If they are not con-flatable solely because of disparate number  or position Cleft orright) with respect to the governor, the SPGwi l l  be structure free.In either case, the conversion process becomes  somewhat  morecomplicated.The process  w i l l  be  i l l us t ra ted  f i r s t  by app ly ing  i t  to a DGwhose  ru les  cannot  be fu l l y  conf la ted  both  because  some are  s t ruc -tu re  sens i t ive  and  because  some ass ign  d i sparate  numbers  o r  po -s i t ions  to dependents  of  a category .Method  2.

This  resu l t s  f rom the fact  that,in  DG3, A has two sets  of dependents  and one set  is inc luded in theother .
The s t ruc ture -sens i t i ve  ru les  for  C in DG3 produced  noaddi t iona l  s t ruc ture -sens i t i ve  ru les  in SPG3, however ,  s ince oneof them, C ($1, was not p rocessed  in step 3 and did not fo rm par tof the IRL.SPG3 may be rewr i t ten  as a s t ruc ture - f ree  grammar  in apure ly  ad hoc way by e l im inat ing  the rewr i t ing  ru le  for  X and shb-st i tut ing S for  the occur rence  of X on the r ight.
More  genera l ly ,i t  is reasonab le  to requ i re  of the or ig ina l  DG that i ts  ru les  be de-s igned so that it is poss ib le  to wr i te  a s ingle  ru le  (schema} as -s igning dependents  to any g iven category .
This  requ i rement  isreasonab le  if the DG is a base  component  of a t rans format iona lg rammar  whose t rans format ions  take care  of the eventua l  o rder  ofe lements  in a sentence .
The pr imary  funct ion of the DO's  depen-dency ru les  is ,  in this case,  only that of l i s t ing ' co -occur r ing  cate -gor ies  in the dependency re la t ions  in some canonica l  o rder .
InDO3, A a lways  occurs  with B as dependent.
Whenever  E is adependent  of A, then e i ther  a second B or a C a re  a lso  depen-dents,  and if  a second B is  a dependent  of A, D is  a lso .
This setof condit ions is summed up by2iSimilarly, B always occurs with E or F as dependents, i.e.,and C occurs with no dependents or  else with both G and F, i.e.,c (* \[O F\]).These rules express co-occurrence relationships more  directlythan the original rules do.
Let us assume this constraint and re-design DG3 as DG4.

A l so  there  i s  asys temat ic  re la t ionsh ip  between the  categor ies  of the  two gram-mars~ wh ich  the  TS makes  exp l i c i t .Somet imes  that  re la t ionsh ip  is  s imp le ,  as  in  the  case  ofDG4 and  SPG4.
G iven  any  category  of  DG4,  there  is  exact ly  onecategory  of SPG4 f rom which  the  same set  of  s t r ings  i s  der ivab le .The  re la t ionsh ip  a l so  ho lds  between the  categor ies  of DGt  andSPGt ,  and  between those  of DG2 and  SPG2.
Under  these  cond i -t ions ,  Hays  \[5\] ca l l s  the  categor ies  "substant ive ly  equ iva lent" .The  re la t ionsh ip  between the  categor ies  of DG3 and  SPG3 i s  lesss imple .
There  the set  of s t r ings  der ivab le  f rom A of the  DG i sthe  un ion  of the  set  of s t r ings  der ivab le  f rom S and  Z of the  SPG,and  the set  der ivab le  f romB is  the  un ion  d the set  der ivab le  f romW and V.Hays says that a D-tree and a P-tree correspond if theycorrespond relationally and if the category at the origin of everycomplete subtree of the D-tree is substantively equivalent to thecategory  labe l ing  the  complete  subt ree  of the  P - t ree  re la ted  to it .If  a DG and an  SPG "have  the same termina l  a lphabet ,  and  fo revery  s t r ing  over  that  a lphabet ,  every  s t ruc ture  a t t r ibuted  bye i ther  cot / responds  to a s t ruc ture  a t t r ibuted  by  the  o ther" ,  he  ca l l sthe  two grammars  "s t rong ly  equ iva lent" .
\[5, p. 52t \ ]  We pre ferto say  that  they  cor respond substant ive ly ,  s ince  re la t iona l  cor re -spondence  i s  asymmetr ic  and  there  are  a lways  " le f t -over"  SPG23categories to which no DG category is substantively equivalent.The weaker relationship exhibited by SPG3 and DG3, where someDG categories are not substantively equivalent to any single SPGcategory, we have been calling systematic correspondence.iConversion by the methods given here results in systema-tic' correspondence.
If the suggested constraints, which appear tobe linguistically well-mot~vated for base components of transfor-mational g rammars ,  are imposed on the form of the source gram-mar, the target g rammar  corresponds substantively as well assystematically to the source grammar  and both are structure free.?
