variolls1)rol)onents of this view propose difl'ere.nt detinitions;t sot|, of "max imal  event" (Kriflca, 1989),  or at st,~te(:onsisting of the negation of an event (de Swart mMMohmdijk, 1994), for instance.29an aspectual operator, but rather as having widescope over the eventuality, as exemplified by theDRS Klb.
This position is the one defended in(Kmnp and Reyle, 1993).We first review the arguments in favour of ourview, and then summarize the discussion pre-sented in (Amsili and Le Draoulec, 1996) againstthe counter-arguments to this view presented in(de Swart and Molendijk, 1994).
We summarizeour semantic proposal in the section 2.3.S impl ic i ty .
One of the reasons wily we may pre-fer the representation Klb tO K~b is that it is sim-pler, from the technical point of view.
Thus, ifsuch a representation is sufficient to account forall the data we want to account for, then there isno need for a more complex representation like tileone exemplified in K~b.
Another point worth not-ing is that, the second proposal is also more com-plex from the ontological point of view.
Addingnew types of discourse referents like ~ in the lan-guage of DRS requires that we define their on-tological properties.
And since these new kindsare defined in terms of others kinds of discoursereferents, this may well be a non-trivial task.Negat ion  in d iscourse.
The ideas developedin this paragraph are based on a study of nega-tion in discourse currently in progress.
The aimof this study is to see how negation interferes withso-called discourse relations (continuation, elabo-ration, explanation...).
To do this, we are using alarge corpus taken from French contemporary lit-erature.
We shall not describe this study in detailhere; nevertheless, one of its findings is relevantto our discussion.We have looked at examples involving Frenchpassg simple (PS, simple past).
This tense typi-cally introduces an event rather than a state.
Wehave a set of 1399 examples of sentential nega-tion, in which one find only 46 occurrences of PS.Among these examples, a majority are of the formexemplified in (3).
(3) a. Je ne lui rfipondis pas.I didn't answer him.b.
~ Elle ne sursauta pas.She didn't startle.Thus, in a majority of cases, PS+negationseems to be used to assert, the absence of an event,and it is very difficult in those cases to find a "realevent" which could be seen as denoted by the sen-tence.3 cases in the corpus seem however to suggestthat negated event sentences may denote events:(4) a. Elle ne le voulut pas.She didn't want it.b.
L'autre ne prit pas de d~tour.The other didn't mince words.c.
Elle ne se laissa pas faire.She didn't let things flow.Thus, one can easily imagine that (4a) "refersto" a gesture, or some kind of behaviour that couldbe interpreted as a refusal.
Here, of course, thisreflmal could probably be associated with ~.But these examples are rare; moreover, the twolast sentences of (4) involve more or less idiomaticexpressions, so that it seems quite reasonable tosee negation here as part of a conventionalisedexpression ("he passe  laisser faire" denoting anevent, just like the verb to refuse does).Events can be defined as a change of state.With this definition in mind, we think that, atleast in the case of PS, negation over events isused mostly to convey something like "nothingchanged", or "the expected event didn't occur",and there is in this case no event denoted by tilesentence.
There remain some cases (very few)where such sentences eem to denote some realchange of the background, but then we claim thatnegation is lexically incorporated, and no longersentential.The  classical  example .
We come now to the"classical" example of (Kamp and Reyle, 1993).It involves tile following discourses:(5) a. Mary looked at Bill.
He smiled.b.
Mary looked at Bill.
He was smiling.c.
Mary looked at Bill.
He didn't smile.d.
Mary looked at Bill.
He wasn't smiling.The pair (5a-5b) exemplify the contrast be-tween simple past and progressive past in narra-tive discourse.
In the second sentence of (5a), thesimple past introduces a new event,, which is lo-calised after tile event introduced in the previoussentence.
In constrast, the second sentence of (5b)introduces a state, which overlaps with the eventof the previous sentence.
This analysis gives tilecorrect prediction for the contrast: in (5a), Bi{l'ssmiling is interpreted as a reaction to Mary's look-ing at Bill, thus following it, whereas in (5b), Billwas already smiling when Mary looked at him.The contrast in (5c-5d) is clearly parallel to thatin (5a-5b).
Since the second sentence of (5d) callreasonably be thought of as introducing a state,also introducing a state for the second (negative)sentence of (5c) would lead us to lose the contrast,since this would suggest, for both sentences thatBill was not smiling when Mary looked at him.Counter -a rguments .
We summarize here thediscussion given in (Amsili and Le Draoulec, 1996)against some of tile arguments given in favour ofthe idea,that negative sentences denote an even-tuality.
There are two main arguments.
One isbased on the fact that negated event sentences ac-cept durative complements (whereas their positivecounterpart do not), this fact being taken as an ar-gument in favour of the aspectual role of negation.Our answers are: first, some French data suggestthat durative complements with negation should30not always be seen as demonstrating the din'aliv-e' ity of the predicate; second, Kamp and Reyl.
s(1993) representation provides a satisfying way toaccount tbr such data.
The second argument isbased on examples ill which an anaphoric refer-ence see, ms to be made to the denotation of nega-tive sentences, therefore suggesting that they haveone.
But these data are rather constrained, insuch a way that it seems that tile discourse refer-ent at stake is an abstract one, nmnely a fact, andnot an event/state.2.3 Proposa lWe can now state 1;he t)rol)osal, ill the ternls of(Kamp and Reyle, 1993, p. 548).
Roughly, theinterpretation of a negated sentence induces thefollowing steps ill tile construction of a DRS:?
introduction of a location time t;?
introduction of a condition relating t with thespeech time n;?
introduction of a con(lition saying that thereis no event or state of a certain l;yl)e whichstands in the relation 'C '  or '0 '  /.o t.As an example, the diseom'se (5c) will receivethe represenl;atioil (6), the most relevant pointsof which being, first, that a temporal constant (t)is systematically introduced into the representa-tion, and second, that negation has wide scopeover event/state discourse referents, t remainingoutside negation.x y n t e u t rMary(x)\]fill(y)t<  neCte : -~ look at y \ ](6)  .l; t < II1 ~\]  e < e I3 Syntact i c  AspectsWe now briefly address l;he syntactic aspects ofFrench sentential negation.
We adopt the rep-resentations envisioned by classical Govermnentand Binding Theory (hereafter GB, Chomsky(1981; 1986)).
Several sl;udies on the struc-ture of I,~'ench clauses, and ill t)articular, neg-ative sentences, have been carried out recentlyill this framework by Pollock (1989; 1993), Hir-shbiihler and Labelle (1993; 1994a) and Pearce(1994) among others.
In this section, we adoptsome of their most relevant results.We are mainly concerned with two of thefour levels of representation of GB, namely D-Structure and S-Structure.
Tile representationsof tiles(; two levels are trees.
D-structures rep-resent basic lexical properties uch as thematicrelations.
S-structures represent more superficialproperties uch as case, binding, etc.
S-structuresderive fi'om D-structures via Move-a: they are theresult of movements that take place in tile latter.In this section, we attempt o answer the follow-ing two questions: (1) what is the D-structure ofFrench negative clauses?
(2) which move.mentstake place between D-Structure and S-Structure?3.1 Spl i t  In f lex ion  Hypothes isThe.
lPrench clause representations we use arerather classical.
They satisfy X'-theory, whichuses well-known syntactic oncepts independent ofany theoretical Damework.
% represent clausesand to build their DRSs, we use a tree struc-ture consisting of a verb phrase VP dominated bytile projection iP of a functional head I bearingthe verbal tense and agreement features (I standsfor inflezion).
IP has the sentence subject NPas its specitier and the.
VI'  as the complement ofits head.
The sentence is therefore representedas an "inftcxional phrase."
'\['his m W be illus-trated by the S-structure (7b) of sentence (7a);(7b) Inky also be ret)reseuted asthe labelled brack-eting giwm ill (7C).

lip \[NP Julie\] \[~, \[I \[vl regard-\] [, -ell \[VP \[v,\[v, t,\] \[NI' Mm'c\]\]\]\]\]Pollock (1989), starting from this general struc-ture, gives a new insight into the problem, byshowing the beuefits of splitting the complex in-flexional category I into two distinct flmctionalcategories, namely tense (T) and verb agreement(Agr).
The general structure of French clausesthat Pollock (1989) proposes is (8a), so that forinstance (7b)becomes (8b):(8) a.
\[Tp NI' rp \[Agrt .... Agr \[VP (AdvP) VP\]\]\]b.
\['rl' \[NP Julie\]\[~,., \[7'/ regarde\] \[Ag,-l' \[Agr' \[Agr it\] \[vp \[v, Iv, t\] \[m' Mare\]\]\]\]\]\]\]3.2 Negat ion(Pollock, 1989) also claims that negation, liketense and verb agreement, is represented as a func-l;ional category, Neg, located between T and Agr.2Note that the morphological decomposition of theverb, shown in (7b), will not be.
made explicit in tilefollowing representations.31In French, this category contains the negative itemne, seen as a weak affix lacking morphologicalstress.
In S-Structure, ne must adjoin to the verbas a clitic.
More generally, it must raise to T infinite clauses as well as infinitives.This proposal has been accepted by many lin-guists.
However, there is no similar consensusabout the position in D-Structure and the possi-ble movements of the second element of Frenchnegation, namely one of the adverbs pas, plus,point, guSt'e, etc.
Here we adopt the proposalof (Hirschbiihler and Labelle, 1993) which statesthat pas (or any of the other negative adverbs)is an adjunct to the maximal projection governedby Neg.
Since Ncg is located between T and Agr,this projection is AgrP.
The general structure ofa lq-ench negative clause is therefore:\[TP NP T \[NegP Neg \[agrP Agr \[vl' (AdvP) VP\]\]\]\]a.a The Aspeetual Dimension of AgrThe previous clause structure improves signifi-cantly the correspondence b tween syntactic rep-resentation and semantic interpretation.
In par-ticular, it becomes easier to differentiate the se-mantic contribution of each element hat is rele-vant at the aspectuo-temporal level.
These ele-ments fall into two categories: those below nega-tion (and therefore inside its scope) and thoseabove negation.Following (de Preitas, 1994; Borer, 1993; Latca,1990), we consider Agr to be rather an aspectualcategory Asp in charge of the aspectual dimen-sion of the semantic representations.
This dimen-sion is introduced by discourse referents.
Recallthat DRT discourse referents do not serve onlyto account for this aspectual dimension, but doplay a fundamental discursive role.
Nevertheless,the categorisation i to states (s) and events (e) ofthe utterances to bc represented, and the possibleintroduction of the discourse referents of one ofthese aspectual category, may be associated withthe Asp head.
This association gives us the ex-peeled result: the discourse referent e or s is inthe scope (in the sense of DRS construction) ofthe possible negation.These elements are all illustrated in the corn-plete syntactic representation of the sentence (9)given in figure 2.
Notice the attachment of thesentential adverb aujourd'hui as adjunct to TP,the highest projection of the representation.
Be-cause of space limitation, we cannot develop thispoint here and refer the reader to (Amsili, 1994).
(9) Aujourd'hui Pierre ne possbAe pas de voiture.~ibday Pierre doesn't own a ear'.4 Bot tom-up const ruct ionWe now integrate the semantics and the syntaxof sentential negation.
We show in this last sec-tion that both representations fit together in theframework of a bottom-up construction proce-dure, which allows a satisfactory computationaltreatment of negation.
We use the method pro-posed in (Asher, 1993), presented in section 4.1,and then show how this nmthod can be applied tothe representations discussed earlier.4.1 Pr inc ip leThe construction procedure is bottom-up.
DR-theoretic expressions are associated with leaves,and then combined to form the final DR,S.
Thecombinatorial method used here is A-conversion,with two kinds of ~-expressions, namely predica-tive DRSs and partial DRSs.
We associate verbsand nouns with 1)redicatiw~ DRSs (for instance,the verb voir (see)) yields Aa:ky voir(x,y)), therole of which is to introduce predicates into therepresentation.
In constrast, discourse ret~rentsare only present in the form of DR-variables; theywill be introduced by the partial DRSs.
Thetranslation of noun phrases (NP) or determinersis quite close to that of the Montagovian tradi-tion.
A determiner is associated with a partialDRS, which is, so to speak, what remains of aDRS when one takes away a predicative DRS.
As aconsequence, there will be variables over predica-tive DRSs (PDRS-variables) in partial DRSs.
Apartial DRS can also contain a declared discom'sereferent.
This discourse referent is meant to serveas an argument of the predicative DRS which willbe assigned to one PDRS-wxriable during the con-version.
In (10) we give a graphical representationof a simple and general case of A-conversion.pm'tial DRS pred.
DRS conversionWe have i1o room here to elaborate oi1 the de-tails of the construction procedure; we refer thereader to (Asher, 1993), and give in figure 1 acomplete xample (with a simpliiied syntactic rep-resentation), for the sentence (11).
(11) Un gars voyait MarieA boy was seeing Mary4.2 ImplementationWhat remains to be done is to integrate this con-struction procedure with the proposals we havemade in this paper.
We cannot, in this shorttext, review all aspects of this integration, and willtherefore mention only the most rele, vant points.We have seen that the representation of timein DRT makes us('.
of two discourse referents (atleast).
It is thus necessary to determine in bothcases which nod(; will be in charge of introducingthe discourse referent.
The pure temporal dinmn-sion, which is accounted for by the time referent;t, will be introduced at the node T. The aspectualdimension, which is accounted for at the seman-tic level by the discourse referent e/s, is associ-32Figure 1: Construction (if the \])RS fl)r (11)S I M"i"(") IL n voitv JN1 I ~  vl,l)ct Nm~ gars V NP.xI'~c~ x"' ~ ( y  I I~\]-'~150 t )air  I'N~ its~\] .

We will therefore ass(l-elate with this node a partial I)RS to introducetim discourse retb, rent.
Finally, we have t(/ takeinto account the possible role of temporal a(tver-bials, which predicate over t. We associate thus apredicative DRS with the node Advl ~ adjoined toTP.
