Confirmed Knowledge Acquisition Using MailsPosted to a Mailing ListYasuhiko Watanabe, Ryo Nishimura, and Yoshihiro OkadaRyukoku University, Seta, Otsu, Shiga, 520-2194, Japanwatanabe@rins.ryukoku.ac.jpAbstract.
In this paper, we first discuss a problem of developing aknowledge base by using natural language documents: wrong informa-tion in natural language documents.
It is almost inevitable that naturallanguage documents, especially web documents, contain wrong informa-tion.
As a result, it is important to investigate a method of detectingand correcting wrong information in natural language documents whenwe develop a knowledge base by using them.
In this paper, we report amethod of detecting wrong information in mails posted to a mailing listand developing a knowledge base by using these mails.
Then, we describea QA system which can answer how type questions based on the knowl-edge base and show that question and answer mails posted to a mailinglist can be used as a knowledge base for a QA system.1 IntroductionBecause of the improvement of NLP, research activities which utilize naturallanguage documents as a knowledge base become popular, such as QA track onTREC [1] and NTCIR [2].
However, these QA systems assumed the user modelwhere the user asks what type questions.
On the contrary, there are a few QAsystems which assumed the user model where the user asks how type question,in other words, how to do something and how to cope with some problem [3] [4][7].
There are several difficulties in developing a QA system which answers howtype questions, and we focus attention to two problems.First problem is the difficulty of extracting evidential sentences by which theQA system answers how type questions.
It is not difficult to extract evidentialsentences by which the QA system answers what type questions.
For example,question (Q1) is a what type question and ?Naoko Takahashi, a marathon runner,won the gold medal at the Sydney Olympics?
is a good evidential sentence foranswering question (Q1).
(Q1) Who won the gold medal in women?s marathonat the Sydney Olympics?
(DA1?1) Naoko Takahashi.It is not difficult to extract this evidential sentence from natural language doc-uments by using common content words and phrases because this sentence andquestion (Q1) have several common content words and phrases.
On the contrary,it is difficult to extract evidential sentences for answering how type questionsR.

Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005132 Y. Watanabe, R. Nishimura, and Y. Okadaonly by using linguistic clues, such as, common content words and phrases.
Forexample, it is difficult to extract evidential sentences for answering how typequestion (Q2) because there may be only a few common content words andphrases between the evidential sentences and question (Q2).
(Q2) How can I cure myself of allergy?
(DA2?1) You had better live in a wooden floor.
(O2?1?1) Keep it clean.
(O2?1?2) Your room is always dirty.
(DA2?2) Drink two spoonfuls of vinegar every day.
(QR2?2?1) I tried, but, no effect.To solve this problem, [3] and [4] proposed methods of collecting knowledgefor answering questions from FAQ documents and technical manuals by usingthe document structure, such as, a dictionary-like structure and if-then formatdescription.
However, these kinds of documents requires the considerable cost ofdeveloping and maintenance.
As a result, it is important to investigate a methodof extracting evidential sentences for answering how type questions from naturallanguage documents at low cost.
To solve this problem, we proposed a methodof developing a knowledge base by using mails posted to a mailing list (ML)[8].
We have the following advantages when we develop knowledge base by usingmails posted to a mailing list.?
it is easy to collect question and answer mails in a specific domain, and?
there is some expectation that information is updated by participantsFurthermore, we developed a QA system and show that mails posted to a mailinglist can be used as a knowledge base by which a QA system answers how typequestions [8].Next problem is wrong information.
It is almost inevitable that natural lan-guage documents, especially web documents, contain wrong information.
Forexample, (DA3?1) is opposed by (QR3?1?1).
(Q3) How I set up my wheel mouse for the netscape ?
(DA3?1) You can find a setup guide in the Dec. issue of SD magazine.
(QR3?1?1) I cannot use it although I modified/usr/lib/netscape/ja/Netscape according to the guide.Wrong information is a central problem of developing a knowledge base by us-ing natural language documents.
As a result, it is important to investigate amethod of detecting and correcting wrong information in natural language doc-uments.
In this paper, we first report a method of detecting wrong informationin question and answer mails posted to a mailing list.
In our method, wronginformation in the mails are detected by using mails which ML participants sub-mitted for correcting wrong information in the previous mails.
Then, the systemgives one of the following confirmation labels to each set of question and theiranswer mails:Confirmed Knowledge Acquisition Using Mails 133positive label shows the information described in a set of a question and itsanswer mail is confirmed by the following mails,negative label shows the information is opposed by the following mails, andother label shows the information is not yet confirmed.Our knowledge base is composed of these labeled sets of a question and its answermail.
Finally, we describe a QA system: It finds question mails which are similarto user?s question and shows the results to the user.
The similarity between user?squestion and a question mail is calculated by matching of user?s question and thesignificant sentence extracted from the question mail.
A user can easily chooseand access information for solving problems by using the significant sentencesand confirmation labels.2 Mails Posted to a Mailing ListThere are mailing lists to which question and answer mails are posted frequently.For example, in Vine Users ML, several kinds of question and answer mailsare posted by participants who are interested in Vine Linux 1.
We intended touse these question and answer mails for developing knowledge base for a QAsystem because?
it is easy to collect question and answer mails in a specific domain,?
it is easy to extract reference relations among mails,?
there is some expectation that information is updated by participants, and?
there is some expectation that wrong information in the previous mails ispointed out and corrected by participants.However, there is a problem of extracting knowledge from mails posted toa mailing list.
As mentioned, it is difficult to extract knowledge for answeringhow type questions from natural language documents only by using linguisticclues, such as, common content words and phrases.
To solve this problem, [3]and [4] proposed methods of collecting knowledge from FAQ documents andtechnical manuals by using the document structure, such as, a dictionary-likestructure and if-then format description.
However, mails posted to a mailinglist, such as Vine Users ML, do not have a firm structure because questionsand their answers are described in various ways.
Because of no firm structure,it is difficult to extract precise information from mails posted to a mailing listin the same way as [3] and [4] did.
However, a mail posted to ML generallyhas a significant sentence.
A significant sentence of a question mail has thefollowing features:1. it often includes nouns and unregistered words which are used in the mailsubject.2.
it is often quoted in the answer mails.3.
it often includes the typical expressions, such as,1 Vine Linux is a linux distribution with a customized Japanese environment.134 Y. Watanabe, R. Nishimura, and Y. Okada(a) (ga / shikasi (but / however)) + ?
?
?
+ mashita / masen / shouka /imasu (can / cannot / whether / current situation is) + .
(ex) Bluefish de nihongo font ga hyouji deki masen.
(I cannot seeJapanese fonts on Bluefish.
)(b) komatte / torabutte / goshido / ?
(have trouble / is troubling / tellme / ?
)(ex) saikin xstart ga dekinakute komatte imasu (In these days, I havetrouble executing xstart.)4.
it often occurs near the beginning.Before we discuss the significant sentence in answer mails, we classified answermails into three types: (1) direct answer (DA) mail, (2) questioner?s reply (QR)mail, and (3) the others.
Direct answer mails are direct answers to the originalquestion.
Questioner?s reply mails are questioner?s answers to the direct answermails.
Suppose that (Q2) in Section 1 and its answers are question and answermails posted to a mailing list, respectively.
In this case, (DA2?1) and (DA2?2) are DA mails to (Q2).
(QR2?2?1) is a QR mail to (DA2?2).
(O2?1?1) and(O2?1?2) are the others.In a DA mail, the answerer gives answers to the questioner, such as (DA2?1)and (DA2?2).
Also, the answerer often asks the questioner back when the ques-tion is imperfect.
As a result, significant sentences in DA mails can be classifiedinto two types: answer type and question type sentence.
They have the followingfeatures:?
it often includes the typical expressions, such as,?
answer type sentence?
dekiru / dekinai (can / cannot)?
shita / shimashita / shiteimasu / shiteimasen (did / have done /doing / did not do)?
shitekudasai / surebayoi (please do / had better)?
question type sentence?
masuka / masenka / desuka (did you / did not you / do you)?
it is often quoted in the following mails.?
it often occurs after and near to the significant sentence of the question mailif it is quoted.In a QR mail, the questioner shows the results, conclusions, and gratitude tothe answerers, such as (QR2?2?1), and sometimes points out wrong informationin a DA mail and correct it, such as, (QR2?2?1) and (QR3?1?1).
A significantsentence in a QR has the following features:?
it often includes the typical expressions.?
dekita / dekimasen (could / could not)?
arigatou (thank)?
it often occurs after and near to the significant sentence of the DA mail if itis quoted.Confirmed Knowledge Acquisition Using Mails 135Taking account of these features, we proposed a method of extracting signif-icant sentences from question mails and their DA mails by using surface clues[8].
Then, we showed, by using the significant sentences extracted from questionand their DA mails, the system can answer user?s questions or, at least, give agood hint to the user.
In this paper, we show that wrong information in a set ofa question mail and its DA mail can be detected by using the QR mail.
Then,we examined whether a user can easily choose and access information for solv-ing problems with our QA system.
In the next section, we will explain how toextract significant sentences from QR mails by using surface clues and confirminformation in a set of a question mail and its DA mail.3 Confirmation of Question and Answer Mails Postedto MLInformation in a set of a question and its DA mail is confirmed by using the QRmail in the next way:step 1. extract a question mail, and its DA and QR mails by using referencerelations and sender?s email address.step 2. extract sentences from each mail by detecting periods and blank lines.step 3. check each sentence whether it is quoted in the following mails.step 4. extract the significant sentence from the question mail by using surfaceclues, such as, words in the subject, quotation in the DA mails, and clueexpressions in the same way as [8] did.step 5. extract the significant sentence from the DA mail by using surface clues,such as, quotation in the QR mail, and clue expressions in the same way as[8] did.step 6. calculate the significant score of each sentence in the QR mail by apply-ing the next two rules.
The sentence which has the largest score is selectedas the significant sentence in the QR mail.rule 6?1: a rule for typical expressions.
Give n points to sentences whichinclude n clue expressions in Figure 1.rule 6?2: when two or more sentences have the largest score by applyingrule 6?1, (1) give 1 point to the sentence which is located after and thenearest to the significant sentence in the DA mail if it is quoted, or (2)give 1 point to the sentence which is the nearest to the lead.step 7. give one of the following confirmation labels to the set of the questionand DA mail.positive label is given to the set of the question and its DA mail when thesignificant sentence in the QR mail has type 1 clue expressions in Fig 1.negative label is given to the set of the question and its DA mail when thesignificant sentence in the QR mail has type 2 clue expressions in Fig 1.other label is given to the set of the question and its DA mail when thesignificant sentence in the QR mail has neither type 1 nor type 2 clueexpressions in Fig 1.136 Y.

Clue expressions for extracting a significant sentence from a QR mailFor evaluating our method, we selected 100 examples of question mails inVine Users ML.
They have 121 DA mails, each of which has one QR mail.First, we examined whether the results of determining the confirmation labelswere good or not.
The results are shown in Table 1.
Table 2 shows the type andnumber of incorrect confirmation.
The reasons of the failures were as follows:?
there were many significant sentences which did not include the clue expres-sions.?
there were many sentences which were not significant sentences but includedthe clue expressions.?
some question mails were submitted not for asking questions, but for givingsome news, notices, and reports to the participants.
In these cases, there wereno answer in the DA mail and no sentence in the QR mail for confirmingthe previous mails.?
questioner?s answer was described in several sentences and one of them wasextracted, and?
misspelling.Next, we examined whether these significant sentences and the confirmationlabels were helpful in choosing and accessing information for solving problems.Our QA system put the significant sentences in reference order, such as,(Q4) vedit ha, sonzai shinai file wo hirakou to suru to core wo haki masuka.
(Does vedit terminate when we open a new file?
)(DA4?1) hai, core dump shimasu.
(Yes, it terminates.
)(DA4?2) shourai, GNOME ha install go sugu tsukaeru no desu ka?
(In near future, can I use GNOME just after the installation?
)Then, we examined whether a user can easily choose and access information forsolving problems.
In other words, we examined whether?
there was good connection between the significant sentences or not, and?
the confirmation label was proper or not.For example, (Q4) and (DA4?1) have the same topic, however, (DA4?2) has adifferent topic.
In this case, (DA4?1) is a good answer to question (Q4).

As a result, the set of (Q4) and (DA4?1) was determinedas correct.
On the contrary, the set of (Q4) and (DA4?2) was a failure.
In thisexperiment, 87 sets of a question and its DA mail were determined as correctand 34 sets were failures.
The reasons of the failures were as follows:?
wrong significant sentences extracted from question mails, and?
wrong significant sentences extracted from DA mails.Failures which were caused by wrong significant sentences extracted from ques-tion mails were not serious.
This is because there is not much likelihood ofmatching user?s question and wrong significant sentence extracted from ques-tion mails.
On the other hand, failures which were caused by wrong significantsentences extracted from DA mails were serious.
In these cases, significant sen-tences in the question mails were successfully extracted and there is likelihoodof matching user?s question and the significant sentence extracted from ques-tion mails.
Therefore, the precision of the significant sentence extraction wasemphasized in this task.Next, we examined whether proper confirmation labels were given to these87 good sets of a question and its DA mail or not, and then, we found thatproper confirmation labels were given to 64 sets in them.
The result was shownin Table 3.We discuss some example sets of significant sentences in detail.
Question (Q5)in Figure 2 has two answers, (DA5?1) and (DA5?2).
(DA5?1) is a suggestion to138 Y. Watanabe, R. Nishimura, and Y. Okada(Q5) sound no settei de komatte imasu.

(First, please try ?sndconfig?.

(Please use xmixer.
)(QR6?1?1) xmixer mo xplaycd mo tsukaemasen.
(I cannot use xmixer and xplaycd, too.)Fig.

Examples of the significant sentence extractionthe questioner of (Q5) and (DA5?2) explains answerer?s experience.
The pointto be noticed is (QR5?1?1).
Because (QR5?1?1) contains type 1 expression inFigure 1, it gives a positive label to the set of (Q5) and (DA5?1).
It guaranteesthe information quality of (DA5?1) and let the user choose and access the answermail from which (DA5?1) was extracted.Example (Q6) is an interesting example.
(DA6?1) in Figure 2 which wasextracted from a DA mail has wrong information.
Then, the questioner of (Q6)confirmed whether the given information was helpful or not, and then, posted(QR6?1?1) in order to point out and correct the wrong information in (DA6?1).In this experiment, we found 16 cases where the questioners posted reply mailsin order to correct the wrong information, and the system found 10 cases inthem and gave negative labels to the sets of the question and its DA mail.4 QA System Using Mails Posted to a Mailing List4.1 Outline of the QA SystemFigure 3 shows the overview of our system.
A user can ask a question to the sys-tem in a natural language.
Then, the system retrieves similar questions from mailsposted to a mailing list, and shows the user the significant sentences which were ex-tracted from the similar question and their answer mails.
A user can easily chooseand access information for solving problems by using the significant sentences andthe confirmation labels.
The system consists of the following modules:Knowledge Base.
It consists of?
question and answer mails (50846 mails),?
significant sentences (26334 sentences: 8964, 13094, and 4276 sentenceswere extracted from question, DA, and QR mails, respectively),?
confirmation labels (4276 labels were given to 3613 sets of a questionand its DA mail), and?
synonym dictionary (519 words).Confirmed Knowledge Acquisition Using Mails 139PositiveNegativeOthersPositiveNegativeOthersQA processor Knowledge BaseUser InterfaceQuestion InputOutputInputAnalyzerSimilarityCalculatorSynonymDictionaryMailsposted to MLAnswersFig.

System overviewQA processor.
It consists of input analyzer and similarity calculator.Input analyzer transforms user?s question into a dependency structure byusing JUMAN[6] and KNP[5].Similarity calculator calculates the similarity between user?s question and asignificant sentence in a question mail posted to a mailing list by using theircommon content words and dependency trees in the next way:The weight of a common content word t which occurs in user?s question Qand significant sentence Si in the mails Mi (i = 1 ?
?
?N) is:wWORD(t, Mi) = tf(t, Si) logNdf(t)where tf(t, Si) denotes the number of times content word t occurs in signif-icant sentence Si, N denotes the number of significant sentences, and df(t)denotes the number of significant sentences in which content word t occurs.Next, the weight of a common modifier-head relation in user?s question Qand significant sentence Si in question mail Mi is:wLINK(l, Mi) = wWORD(modifier(l), Mi) + wWORD(head(l), Mi)where modifier(l) and head(l) denote a modifier and a head of modifier-head relation l, respectively.Therefore, the similarity score between user?s question Q and significantsentence Si of question mail Mi, SCORE(Q, Mi), is set to the total weightof common content words and modifier-head relations which occur user?squestion Q and significant sentence Si of question mail Mi, that is,SCORE(Q, Mi) =?t?TiwWORD(t, Mi) +?l?LiwLINK(l, Mi)where the elements of set Ti and set Li are common content words andmodifier-head relations in user?s question Q and significant sentence Si inquestion mail Mi, respectively.140 Y. Watanabe, R. Nishimura, and Y. OkadaWhen the number of common content words which occur in user?s question Qand significant sentence Si in question mail Mi is more than one, the similaritycalculator calculates the similarity score and sends it to the user interface.User Interface.
Users can access to the system via a WWW browser by usingCGI based HTML forms.
User interface put the answers in order of thesimilarity scores.4.2 EvaluationFor evaluating our method, we gave 32 questions in Figure 4 to the system.These questions were based on question mails posted to Linux Users ML.

(2) I cannot make a sound on Linux.
(3) I have a problem when I start up X Window System.
(4) Tell me how to restore HDD partition to its normal condition.
(5) Where is the configuration file for giving SSI permission to Apache ?

Table 4 (c) shows the numberand type of confirmation labels which were given to proper answers.In Test 1, our system answered question 2, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 19, and 24.In contrast, the full text retrieval system answered question 2, 5, 7, 19, and 32.Both system answered question 2, 7 and 19, however, the answers were different.This is because several solutions of a problem are often sent to a mailing list andthe systems found different but proper answers.
In all the tests, the results of ourmethod were better than those of full text retrieval.
Our system answered morequestions and found more proper answers than the full text retrieval systemdid.
Furthermore, it is much easier to choose and access information for solvingproblems by using the answers of our QA system than by using the answers ofthe full text retrieval system.Both systems could not answer question 4, ?Tell me how to restore HDD par-tition to its normal condition?.
However, the systems found an answer in whichthe way of saving files on a broken HDD partition was mentioned.
Interestingly,this answer may satisfy a questioner because, in such cases, our desire is to savefiles on the broken HDD partition.
In this way, it often happens that there are142 Y. Watanabe, R. Nishimura, and Y. Okadagaps between what a questioner wants to know and the answer, in several as-pects, such as concreteness, expression and assumption.
To overcome the gaps,it is important to investigate a dialogue system which can communicate withthe questioner.References1.
