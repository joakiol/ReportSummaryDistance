The Role Of Focussing in Interpretation of PronounsCandace L. SidnerArtificial Intelligence LaboratoryMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyCambridge, MA 02139;rodBolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc.50 Moulton StreetCambridge" MA 02138In this p;,per I \[ discuss the formal relationship betweenthe process of focussing and interpret;ition of pronominalanaphora.
The discussion of focussing extends the work ofGrosz \[1977\].
Foct,ssing is defined algorithmical\]y as a processwhich chooses a focus of attention in a discourse and moves itaround as the speaker's focus ch'mges.
The paper shows how touse the focussing algorithm by ;m extended example given below.DI-I  Alfred a,ld Zohar liked to play baseball.2 They played it everyday after school beforedinner.3 After their game, the two usually went for icecream cones.4 They tasted really good.5 Alfred always had the vanilla super scooper,6 while Zohar tried the flavor of the day cone.7 After the cones had been eaten,8 the boys went home to study.In this example, the discourse focusses initially on baseball.
Thefocus moves in DI-3 to the ice cream cone.
Using this example,I show how the formal algorithm computes focus and determineshow the focus moves according to the signals which the speakeruses in discourse to indicate the movement.Given a process notion of focus, the paper reviews thedifficulties with previous approaches (Rieger \[1974\], Charniak\[1972\], Winograd \[1971\], Hobbs \[1975\] and Lockman \[1978\]).Briefly, the first four authors all point out the need forinferencing as part of anaphora disambiguation, but each oftheir schemes for inferencing suffer from the need for controlwhich will reduce the combinatorial search or which will insureonly one search path is taken.
In addition, Winograd andLockman are aware of pronopn phenomena which cannot betreated strictly by inference, as shown below.D2-1 I haven't seen Jeff for several days.2 Carl thinks h e's studying for his exams.3 Oscar says hj is sick,4 but I think he went to the Cape with Linda.1.
This report describes research done at the ArtificialIntelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology.
Support for the laboratory's artificial intelligenceresearch is provided in part by the Advanced Research ProjectsAgency of the Department of Defense under the Office ofNaval Research under Contract Number N00014-73-C4)643.However, their approaches are either simple heuristics whichoffer no unified treatment (Winograd) or require thecomputation of a structure which must assume the pronounshave previously been resolved (Lockman).In order to state formal rules for pronouninterpretation, the concept of antecedence is definedcomputationally as a relationship among elements represented ina database.
Using this framework, the paper supports twoclaims by means of rules for antecedence.I.
The focus provides a source ofantecedence in rules for interpretingpronominal anaphora.2.
Focussing provides a control for theinferencing necessary for some kinds ofanaphora.The rulesconfirmingrestrictionsThe use ofD3 below.D3-I2for pronominal anaphora rely on three sources ofinformation: syntactic criteria, semantic selectionaland consistency checks from inferencing procedures.these rules are presented for examples D2 above andWhitimore isn't such a good thief.The man whose watch he stole called thepolice.3 They catzght him.These examples show how to use the three sources ofinformation to support or reject a predicted antecedence.
Inparticular, inferencing is controlled by checking for consistencyon a predicted choice rather than by search ~lsing generalinference.The paper also indicates what additional requirementsare needed for a full treatment of pronominal anphora.
Theseinclude use of a representation such as that of Webber \[197g\];linguistic rules such as the disjoint reference rules of Lasnik\[\[976\] and Reinhart \[\[976\] as well as rules of anapbora inlogical form given by Cbomsky \[1976\]; and presence of actorloci such as they in D3.
The nature of these requirements isdiscussed, while the computational inclusion of them is found in$idner \[ 1979\]."771.
