Exploring the Characteristics of Multi-Party DialoguesMasato  I sh izak iJapan Advanced Institute of Science and TechnologyTatsunokuchi, Noumi, Ishikawa, 923-1292, JapanmasatoQjaist.ac.jpTsuneak i  KatoNTT Communication Science Labs.2-4, Hikaridai, Seika, Souraku, Kyoto, 619-0237, Japankato@cslab.kecl.ntt.co.jpAbst rac tThis paper describes novel results on the char-acteristics of three-party dialogues by quantita-tively comparing them with those of two-party.In previous dialogue research, two-party dia-logues are mainly focussed because data col-lection of multi-party dialogues is difficult andthere are very few theories handling them, al-though research on multi-party dialogues is ex-pected to be of much use in building computersupported collaborative work environments andcomputer assisted instruction systems.
In thispaper, firstly we describe our data collectionmethod of multi-party dialogues using a meet-ing scheduling task, which enables us to com-pare three-party dialogues with those of twoparty.
Then we quantitively compare thesetwo kinds of dialogues uch as the number ofcharacters and turns and patterns of informa-tion exchanges.
Lastly we show that patternsof information exchanges in speaker alternationand initiative-taking can be used to characterisethree-party dialogues.1 In t roduct ionPrevious research on dialogue has been mostlyfocussing on two-party human-human dialoguefor developing practical human-computer dia-logue systems.
However, our everyday commu-nicative activities involves not only two-partycommunicative situations but also those of morethan two-party (we call this multi-party).
Forexample, it is not unusual for us to chitchat withmore than one friend, or business meetings areusually held among more than two participants.Recently advances of computer and network-ing technologies nable us to examine the possi-bility of using computers to assist effective com-munication in business meetings.
As well asthis line of computer assisted communicationresearch, autonomous programs called 'agents',which enable users to effectively use comput-ers for solving problems, have been extensivelystudied.
In this research trend, 'agent' is sup-posed to be distributed among computers, andhow they cooperate for problem solving is oneof the most important research topics.
Pre-vious studies on two party dialogue can be ofsome use to the above important computer re-lated communication research, but research onmulti-party interaction can contribute more di-rectly to the advances of the above research.Furthermore, research on multi-party dialogueis expected to make us understand the natureof human communication i combination withthe previous and ongoing research on two-partydialogue.The purpose of this paper is to quantitivelyshow the characteristics of multi-party dia-logues in comparison with those of two-partyusing actual dialogue data.
In exploring thecharacteristics of multi-party dialogues to thoseof two-party, we will concentrate on the follow-ing problems.What  patterns of information ex-changes do conversational partici-pants form?
When abstracting the typesof speech acts, in two-party dialogues, thepattern of information exchanges is thatthe first and second speakers alternatelycontribute (A-B-A-B .
.
. )
.
But in multi-party dialogues, for example, in three-partydialogues, dialogue does not seem to pro-ceed as A-B-C-A-B-C .
.
.
,  since this pat-tern seems to be too inefficient if B tells Cwhat B are told by A, which C will be toldthe same content twice, and too efficientand strict if A, B and C always initiate newtopics in this order, in which they have no583occasions for checking one's understanding.?
How do conversat ional  part ic ipantstake init iat ive?
In business meetings,most of which are of multi-party, chairper-sons usually control the flow of informa-tion for effective and efficient discussions.Are there any differences between in multi-and two-party dialogues?
For example, arethere any possibilities if in multi-party di-alogues the role of chairpersons emergesfrom the nature of the dialogues?These are not only problems in exploringmulti-party dialogues.
For example, we donot know how conversational participants taketurns (when do they start to talk)?
Or howand when do conversational participants formsmall subgroups?
However, the two problemswe will tackle here are very important issues tobuilding computer systems in that they directlyrelates to topic management in dialogue pro-cessing, which is necessary to correctly processanaphora/ellipsis and effective dialogue control.In the following, firstly, previous research onmulti-party dialogues i  surveyed.
Secondly, ourtask domain, data collection method, and ba-sic statistics of the collected ata are explained.Thirdly, our dialogue coding scheme, coding re-sults and the resultant patterns of informationexchanges for two- and multi-party dialoguesare shown.
Lastly, the patterns of initiative tak-ing behaviour are discussed.2 Re la ted  Stud iesSugito and Sawaki (1979) analysed three nat-urally occurring dialogues to characterise lan-guage behaviour of Japanese in shopping situ-ations between a shop assistant and two cus-tomers.
They relate various characteristics oftheir dialogue data such as the number of ut-terances, the types of information exchangesand patterns of initiative taking to the stagesor phases of shopping like opening, discussionsbetween customers, clarification by a customerwith a shop assistant and closing.Novick and Ward (1993) proposed a compu-tational model to track belief changes of a pilotand an air traffic controller in air traffic control(ATC) communication.
ATC might be calledmulti-party dialogue in terms of the number ofconversational participants.
An air traffic con-troller exchanges messages with multiple pilots.But this is a rather special case for multi-partydialogues in that all of ATC communicationconsists of two-party dialogues between a pilotand an air traffic controller.Novick et al (1996) extended 'contributiongraph' and how mutual belief is constructedfor multi-party dialogues, which was proposedby Clark (1992).
They used their extension toanalyse an excerpt of a conversation betweenNixon and his brain trust involving the Water-gate scandal.
Clark's contribution graph can bethought of as a reformulation of adjacency pairsand insertion sequences in conversation analy-sis from the viewpoint hat how mutual belief isconstructed, and are devoted to the analysis oftwo-party dialogues.
They proposed to includereactions of non-intended listeners as evidencefor constructing mutual belief and modify thenotation of the contribution graph.Schegloff (1996) pointed out three researchtopics of multi-party dialogue from the view-point of conversation analysis.
The first topicinvolves recipient design.
A speaker builds ref-erential expressions for the intended listener tobe easily understood, which is related to nextspeaker selection.
The second concerns reason-ing by non-intended listeners.
When a speakerpraises ome conversational participant, he re-maining participants can make inferences thatthe speaker criticises what they do not do orbehave like the praised participant.
The thirdis schism, which can be often seen in some par-ties or teaching classes.
For example, when aspeaker continue to talk an uninteresting storyfor hours, party attendees split to start to talkneighbours locally.Eggins and Slade (1997) analysed naturally-occurring dialogues using systemic grammarframework to characterise various aspects ofcommunication such as how attitude is encodedin dialogues, how people negotiate with, andsupport for and confront against others, andhow people establish group membership.By and large, on multi-party dialogues, thereare very few studies in computational linguis-tics and there are several or more researches onmulti-party dialogue, which analyse only theirexample dialogues in discourse analysis.
But asfar as we know, there is no research on quanti-tatively comparing the characteristics of multi-584party dialogues with those of two-party.
Re-search topics enumerated for conversation anal-ysis are also of interest to computational lin-guistic research, but obviously we cannot han-dle all the problems of multi-party dialogueshere.
This paper will concentrate on the pat-terns of information exchanges and initiativetaking, which are among issues directly relatedto computer modelling of multi-party dialogues.3 Data  Co l lec t ion  and  Bas icS ta t i s t i csFor the purpose of developing distributed au-tonomous agents working for assisting userswith problem solving, we planned and collectedtwo- and three-party dialogues using the taskof scheduling meetings.
We tried to set up thesame problem solving situations for both typesof dialogues uch as participants' goals, knowl-edge, gender, age and background education.Our goal is to develop computational pplica-tions where agents with equal status solve users'problems by exchanging messages, which is thereason why he did not collect dialogue databetween between different status like expert-novice and teacher-pupils.The experiments were conducted in such away that for one task, the subjects are givena list of goals (meetings to be scheduled) andsome pieces of information about meeting roomsand equipments like overhead projectors, andare instructed to make a meeting schedule forsatisfying as many participants' constraints aspossible.
The data were collected by assigning3 different problems or task settings to 12 par-ties, which consist of either two or three sub-jects, which amounts to 72 dialogues in total.The following conditions were carefully set upto make dialogue subjects as equal as possible.?
Both two- and three-party subjects wereconstrained to be of the same gender.
Thesame number of dialogues (36 dialogues)were collected for female and male groups.?
The average ages of female and male sub-jects are 21.0 (S.D.
1.6) and 20.8 (S.D.
2.1)years old.
All participants are either a uni-versity student or a graduate.?
Subjects were given the same number ofgoals and information (needless to say,\[ I  of chars.

The aver-age length of all collected ialogues is 473.5 sec-onds (approximately 7.9 minutes) and the totalamounts to 34094 seconds (approximately 9.5hours).There are dialogues in which participantsmistakenly finished before they did not satisfyall possible constraints.
It is very rare that oneparty did this sort of mistakes for all three tasksettings assigned to them, however in order toeliminate unknown effects, we exclude all threedialogues if they made mistakes in at least onetask setting.
For this reason, we limit the targetof our analysis to 18 dialogues each for two- andthree-party dialogues which do not have suchkind of problem (the average length of the tar-get dialogues is 494.2 seconds (approximately8.2 minutes).Table 1 shows the number of hiragana char-acters 1 and turns for each speakers, and itstotal for two- and three-party dialogues.
It il-lustrates that the total number of charactersand turns of three-party dialogues are almostthe same as those of two-party, which indicates1 This paper uses the number of hiragana characters toassess how much speakers talk.
One hiragana characterapproximately corresponds toone mora, which has beenused as a phonetic unit in Japanese.585the experimental setup worked as intended be-tween two- and three-party dialogues.
Table 2shows ANOVA of the number of hiragana char-acters and turns calculated separately for dif-ferent task settings to examine whether thereare differences of the number of characters andturns between speakers.
The results indicatesthat there are statistically no differences at .05level to the number of characters and turns fordifferent speakers both in two- and three-partydialogues except for one task setting as to thenumber of turns in three-party dialogues.
Butthis are statistically no differences at .01 level.For the experimental setup, we can understandthat our setup generally worked as intended.4 Pat terns  o f  In fo rmat ion  Exchanges4.1 Dia logue Cod ingTo examine patterns of information exchangesand initiative taking, we classify utterancesfrom the viewpoint of initiation-response andspeech act types.
This classification is amodification of the DAMSL coding scheme,which comes out of the standardisation work-shop on discourse coding scheme (Carletta etal., 1997b), and a coding scheme proposed byJapanese standardisation working group on dis-course coding scheme(Ichikawa et al, 1998)adapted to the characteristics of this meetingscheduling task and Japanese.
We used twocoders to classify utterances in the above 36dialogues and obtained 70% rough agreementand 55% kappa agreement value.
Even in theabove discourse coding standardisation groups,they are not at the stage where which agreementvalue range coding results need to be reliable.In content analysis, they require a kappa valueover 0.67 for deriving a tentative conclusion,but in a guideline of medical science, a kappavalue 0.41 < g < 0.60 are judged to be mod-erate (Carletta et al, 1997a; Landis and Koch,1977; Krippendorff, 1980).
To make the anal-ysis of our dialogue data robust, we analysedboth coded dialogues, and obtained similar re-sults.
As space is limited, instead of discussingboth results, we discuss one result in the fol-lowing.
From the aspect of initiation-response,utterances are examined if they fall into the cat-egory of response, which is judged by checkingif they can discern cohesive relations betweenthe current and corresponding utterances if ex-Types of speech act .for initiatingWant-propose(WP), Inform(IF), Request(RQ)Types of speech act for respondingPositive_answer-accept (PA), Negative_answer-reject(NA), Content-answer(CA), Hold(HL)Types of speech act -for bothQuestion-check(QC), Counter_propose(CP),Meta(MT)Table 3: Types of speech act for coding two-and three-party dialoguesist.
The corresponding utterances must be oneswhich are either just before the current or someutterances before the current in the case of em-bedding, or insertion sequences.
If the currentutterance is not judged as response, then it fallsinto the category of initiation.From speech act types, as in Table 3, utter-ances are classified into five types each for ini-tiating and responding, two of which are usedfor both initiating and responding.
Bar ('-') in-serted categories how adaptation to our taskdomain and Japanese.
For example, in this taskdomain, expressions of 'want' for using somemeeting room are hard to be distinguished fromthose of 'proposal' in Japanese, and thus thesetwo categories are combined into one category'want-proposal'.4.2 Pat terns  of  act sequences  byspeakersTable 5 shows the frequency ratio as to thelength of act sequences represented by differentspeakers in two- and three-party dialogues.
Theact sequences are defined to start from a newlyinitiating utterance to the one before next newlyinitiating utterance.
Let us examine an excerptin Table 4 from our dialogue data, where thefirst column shows a tentative number of utter-ances, the second is a speaker, the third is an ut-terance type, and the fourth is English transla-tion of an utterance.
In this example, there aretwo types of act sequences from the first to thefifth utterance (E-S-E-S-E) and from the sixthto the seventh (S-H).
Our purpose here is to ex-amine how many of the act sequences consistsof two participants' interaction in three-partydialogues.
Hence we abstract a speakers' namewith the position in a sequence.
The speaker in5862acts 3acts 4acts  5acts 6acts2-p 54.2 21.6 11.8 5.3 2.13-p 45.1 26.0 12.2 5.4 2.4Table 5: Frequency ratio (%) for the number ofact sequences in two- and three-party dialoguesthe first turn is named A, and the one in thesecond and third turn are named B and C, re-spectively.In both two- and three-party dialogues, themost frequent length of act sequences i  that oftwo speakers.
The frequencies decrease as thelength of act sequences increases.
In two-partydialogues, speaker sequences concern only theirlength, since there are two speakers to be alter-nate while in three-party dialogues, more thantwo length of sequences take various patterns,for example, A-B-A and A-B-C in three act se-quences.
Table 6 illustrates patterns of speakersequences and their frequency ratios.
In threeact sequences, the frequency ratios of A-B-Aand A-B-C are 62.7% and 37.3%, respectively,which signifies the dominance of two-party in-teractions.
Likewise, in four, five and six act se-quences, two-party interactions are dominant,53.2%, 36.7% and 31.8%, both of which arefar more frequent han theoretical expected fre-quencies (25%, 12.5 and 6.3%).
In three-partydialogues, two-party interactions amounts to70.6% (45.1%+26.0% x 62.7%+ 12.2% x 53.2%+5.4% x 36.7% + 2.4% x 31.8% = 70.6%) againsttotal percentage 91.1% from two to six act se-quences (if extrapolating this number to total100% is allowable, 77.5% of the total interac-tions are expected to be of two-party).
Theconc lus ion here is that  two-party  inter-act ions are dominant  in three-party  dia-logues.
This conclusion holds for our meetingscheduling dialogue data, but intuitively its ap-plicability to other domains eems to be promis-ing, which should obviously need further work.4.3 Pat terns  of  in i t iat ive tak ingThe concept 'initiative' is defined by Whittakerand Stenton (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988) us-ing a classification of utterance types assertions,commands, questions and prompts.
The initia-tive was used to analyse behaviour of anaphoricexpressions in (Walker and Whittaker, 1990).3 act sequences \[ABel A?c I 62.7 37.34 act sequences53.2 17.1 16.2 13.5I 5 act sequencesABABA ABCAB36.7 16.3ABABCABACA10.2(each)Others26.66 act sequencesABABAB ABCACB ABABAC OthersABCACA31.8 18.2 9.1(each) 31.8Table 6: Frequency ratio (%) of 3 to 6 act se-quences in three-party dialoguesThe algorithm to track the initiative was pro-posed by Chu-Carroll and Brown (1997).
Therelationship between the initiative and efficiencyof task-oriented dialogues was empirically andanalytically examined in (Ishizaki, 1997).
Bytheir definition, a conversational participant hasthe initiative when she makes some utteranceexcept for responses to partner's utterance.
Thereason for this exception is that an utterancefollowing partner's utterance should be thoughtof as the one elicited by the previous speakerrather than directing a conversation in theirown right.
A participant does not have theinitiative (or partner has the initiative) whenshe uses a prompt to partner, since she clearlyabdicates her opportunity for expressing somepropositional content.Table 7 and 8 show the frequency ratios ofwho takes the initiative and X 2 value calculatedfrom the frequencies for two- and three-party di-alogues.
In two-party dialogues, based on its X 2values, the initiative is not equally distributedbetween speakers in 5 out of 18 dialogues at .05rejection level.
In three-party dialogues, thisoccurs in 10 out of 18 dialogues, which signifiesthe emergence of an initiative-taker or a chair-person.
To examine the roles of the participantsin detail, the differences of the participants' be-haviour between two- and three party informa-587# Sp Type Utterance1 E WP2 S3 E4 S5 E6 S7 HWell, I want to plan my group's three-hour meeting after a two-hour meetingwith Ms. S's group.QC After the meeting?PA Yes.PA Right.PA Right.QC What meetings do you want to plan, Ms. H?CA I want to schedule our group's meeting for two hours.Table 4: An excerpt from the meeting scheduling dialoguesI ?25 J ?53 1 J 7.43 f 7?8 1 ?71 1 ?

The table shows thecomparison between two and three speaker in-teractions in three-party dialogues as to as whotakes the initiative in 3 to 6 act sequences.
Fromthis table, we can observe the tendency that Etakes the initiative more frequently than S andH for all three problem settings in two-partyinteraction, and two of three settings in three-party interaction.
S has a tendency to take moreinitiatives in two-party interaction than that inthree-party.
H's initiative taking behaviour isthe other way around to S's.
Comparing withS's and H's initiative taking patterns, E can besaid to take the initiative constantly irrespectiveof the number of party in interaction.The conclusion here is that  init iative-taking behaviour  is more clearly observedin three-party  dialogues than those intwo-party dialogues.
Detailed analysis ofthe participants' behaviour indicates that theremight be differences when the participants takethe initiative, which are characterised by thenumber of participants in interaction.5 Conc lus ion  and  Fur ther  WorkThis paper empirically describes the impor-tant characteristics of three-party dialogues byanalysing the dialogue data collected in the taskof meeting scheduling domain.
