Department of Computer Languages and SystemsAbstractIn this paper we describe a rule-based sys-tem developed for the BioNLP 2011 GENIAevent detection task.
The system applies Ky-bots (Knowledge Yielding Robots) on anno-tated texts to extract bio-events involving pro-teins or genes.
The main goal of this work is toverify the usefulness and portability of the Ky-bot technology to the domain of biomedicine.1 IntroductionThe aim of the BioNLP?11 Genia Shared Task (Kimet al, 2011b) concerns the detection of molecularbiology events in biomedical texts using NLP toolsand methods.
It requires the identification of eventstogether with their gene or protein arguments.
Nineevent types are considered: localization, binding,gene expression, transcription, protein catabolism,phosphorylation, regulation, positive regulation andnegative regulation.When identifying the events related to the givenproteins, it is mandatory to detect also the eventtriggers, together with its associated event-type, andrecognize their primary arguments.
There are ?sim-ple?
events, concerning an event together with itsarguments (Theme, Site, ...) and also ?complex?events, or events that have other events as secundaryarguments.
Our system did not participate in the op-tional tasks of recognizing negation and speculation.The training dataset contained 909 texts togetherwith a development dataset of 259 texts.
347 textswere used for testing the system.The main objective of the present work was to ver-ify the applicability of a new Information Extraction(IE) technology developed in the KYOTO project1(Vossen et al, 2008), to a new specific domain.
TheKYOTO system comprises a general and extensiblemultilingual architecture for the extraction of con-ceptual and factual knowledge from texts, which hasalready been applied to the environmental domain.Currently, our system follows a rule-based ap-proach (i.e.
(Kim et al, 2009), (Kim et al, 2011a),(Cohen et al, 2011) or (Vlachos, 2009)), using a setof manually developed rules.2 System DescriptionOur system proceeds in two phases.
Firstly, text doc-uments are tokenized and structured using an XMLlayered structure called KYOTO Annotation Format(KAF) (Bosma et al, 2009).
Secondly, a set of Ky-bots (Knowledge Yielding Robots) are applied to de-tect the biological events of interest occurring in theKAF documents.
Kybots form a collection of gen-eral morpho-syntactic and semantic patterns on se-quences of KAF terms.
These patterns are definedin a declarative format using Kybot profiles.2.1 KAFFirstly, basic linguistic processors apply segmenta-tion and tokenization to the text.
Additionally, theoffset positions of the proteins given by the task or-ganizers are also considered.
The output of this ba-sic processing is stored in KAF, where words, terms,syntactic and semantic information can be stored inseparate layers with references across them.Currently, our system only considers a minimalamount of linguistic information.
We are only using1http://www.kyoto-project.eu/138the word form and term layers.
Figure 1 shows anexample of a KAF document where proteins havebeen annotated using a special POS tag (PRT).
Notethat our approach did not use any external resourceapart of the basic linguistic processing.<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?><KAF xml:lang="en"><text>...<wf wid="w210" sent="10">phosphorylation</wf><wf wid="w211" sent="10">of</wf><wf wid="w212" sent="10">I</wf><wf wid="w213" sent="10">kappaB</wf><wf wid="w214" sent="10">alpha<...</text><term tid="t210" type="open" lemma="phosphorylation"start="1195" end="1210" pos="W"><span><target id="w210"/></span></term><term tid="t211" type="open" lemma="of"start="1211" end="1213" pos="W"><span><target id="w211"/></span></term><term tid="T5" type="open" lemma="I kappaB alpha"start="1214" end="1228" pos="PRT"><span><target id="w212"/></span><target id="w213"/><target id="w214"/></span></term>...</terms></KAF>Figure 1: Example of a document in KAF format.2.2 KybotsKybots (Knowledge Yielding Robots) are abstractpatterns that detect actual concept instances and re-lations in KAF.
The extraction of factual knowledgeby the mining module is done by processing theseabstract patterns on the KAF documents.
These pat-terns are defined in a declarative format using Kybotprofiles, which describe general morpho-syntacticand semantic conditions on sequences of terms.
Ky-bot profiles are compiled to XQueries to efficientlyscan over KAF documents uploaded into an XMLdatabase.
These patterns extract and rank the rele-vant information from each match.Kybot profiles are described using XML syn-tax and each one consists of three main declarativeparts:?
Variables: In this part, the entities and its prop-erties are defined?
Relations: This part specifies the positional re-lations among the previously defined variables?
Events: describes the output to be produced forevery matchingVariables (see the Kybot section variables in fig-ure 2) describe the term variables used by the Kybot.They have been designed with the aim of being flex-ible enough to deal with many different informationassociated with the KAF terms including semanticand ontological statements.Relations (see the Kybot section relations in fig-ure 2) define the sequence of variables the Kybotis looking for.
For example, in the Kybot in fig-ure 2, the variable named Phosphorylationis the main pivot, the variable Of must followPhosphorylation (immediate is true indi-cating that it must be the next term in the sequence),and a variable representing a Proteinmust followOf.
Proteins and genes are identified with the PRTtag.Events (expressions marked as events in figure 2)describes the output template of the Kybot.
For ev-ery matched pattern, the kybot produces a new eventfilling the template structure with the selected piecesof information.
For example, the Kybot in figure 2selects some features of the event represented withthe variable called Phosphorylation: its term-identification (@tid), its lemma, part of speech andoffset.
The expression also describes that the vari-able Protein plays the role of being the ?Theme?of the event.
The output obtained when aplying theKybot in figure 2 is shown in figure 3.
Comparingthe examples in table 1 and in figure 3 we observethat all the features needed for generating the filesfor describing the results are also produced by theKybot.<doc shortname="PMID-9032271.kaf"><event eid="e1" target="t210" kybot="phosphorylation of P"type="Phosphorylation"lemma="phosphorylation" start="1195" end="1210" /><role target="T5" rtype="Theme"lemma="I kappaB alpha" start="1214" end="1228" /></doc>Figure 3: Output obtained after the application of the Ky-bot in figure 2.3 GENIA Event Extraction Task andResultsWe developed a set of basic auxiliary pro-grams to extract event patterns from the train-ing corpus.

For example, in thetraining corpus, a pattern of the type Eventof Protein appears 35 times, where theEvent is further described as phosporylation,phosphorylated....
Taking the most fre-quently occurring patterns in the training data intoaccount, we manually developed the set of Kybotsused to extract the events from the development andtest corpora.
For example, in this way we wrote theKybot in figure 2 that fulfils the conditions of thepattern of interest.The two phases mentioned in section 2, corre-sponding to the generation of the KAF documentsand the application of Kybots, have different inputfiles depending on the type of event we want todetect: simple or complex events.
When extract-ing simple events (see figure 4), we used the in-put text and the files containing protein annotations(?.a1?
files in the task) to generate the KAF docu-ments.
These KAF documents and Kybots for sim-ple events are provided to the mining module.
Inthe case of complex events (events that have otherKAF generator.txt.a1.kafKybot processorKybots(Simple).a2Figure 4: Application of Kybots.
Simple events.events as arguments), the identifiers of the detectedsimple events are added to the KAF document in thefirst phase.
A new set of Kybots describing complexevents and KAF (now with annotations of the simpleevents) are used to obtain the final result (see figure5).For the evaluation, we also developed some pro-grams for adapting the output of the Kybots (see fig-ure 3) to the required format (see table 1).We used the development corpus to improve theKybot performance.
We developed 65 Kybots fordetecting simple events.
Table 2 shows the numberof Kybots for each event type.
Complex events rela-tive to regulation (also including negative and posi-tive regulations) were detected using a set of 24 Ky-bots.The evaluation of the task was based on the output140KAF generator.a2.kaf.kaf(with simple events)Kybot processorKybots(Complex).a2Figure 5: Application of Kybots.

Table 3 shows in the Goldcolumn the number of instances for each event-typein the test corpus.
R, P and F-score columns standfor the recall, precision and f-score the system ob-tained for each type of event.
As a consequence ofthe characteristics of our system, precision is primedover recall.
For example, the system obtains 95%and 97% precision on Phosphorylation an Localiza-tion events, respectively, although its recall is con-siderably lower (41% and 19%).4 Conclusions and Future workThis work presents the first results of the applica-tion of the KYOTO text mining system for extractingevents when ported to the biomedical domain.
TheKYOTO technology and data formats have shown tobe flexible enough to be easily adapted to a new taskand domain.
Although the results are far from satis-factory, we must take into account the limited effortwe dedicated to adapting the system and designingthe kybots, which can be roughly estimated in twoEvent Class Gold R P F-scoreLocalization 191 19.90 97.44 33.04Binding 491 5.30 50.00 9.58Gene Expression 1002 54.19 42.22 47.47Transcription 174 13.22 62.16 21.80Protein catabolism 15 26.67 44.44 33.33Phosphorylation 185 41.62 95.06 57.89Non-reg total 2058 34.55 47.27 39.92Regulation 385 7.53 9.63 8.45Positive regulation 1443 6.38 62.16 11.57Negative regulation 571 3.15 26.87 5.64Regulatory total 2399 5.79 26.94 9.54All total 4457 19.07 42.08 26.25Table 3: Performance analysis on the test dataset.person/months.After the final evaluation, our system obtained thethirteenth position out of 15 participating systemsin the main task (processing PubMed abstracts andfull paper articles), obtaining 19.07%, 42.08% and26.25 recall, precision an f-score, respectively, farfrom the best competing system (49.41%, 64.75%and 56.04%).
Although they are far from satisfac-tory, we must take into account the limited time wededicated to adapting the system and designing thekybots.
Apart from that, due to time restrictions,our system did not make use of the ample set ofresources available, such as named entities, corefer-ence resolution or syntactic parsing of the sentences.On the other hand, the system, based on manuallydeveloped rules, obtains reasonable accuracy in thetask of processing full paper articles, obtaining 45%precision and 21% recall, compared to 59% and 47%for the best system, which means that the rule-basedapproach performs more robustly when dealing withlong texts (5 full texts correspond to approximately150 abstracts).
As we have said before, our mainobjective was to evaluate the capabilities of the KY-OTO technology without adding any additional in-formation.
The use of more linguistic informationwill probably facilitate our work and will benefit thesystem results.
In the near future we will study theapplication of machine learning techniques for theautomatic generation of Kybots from the trainingdata.
We also plan to include additional linguisticand semantic processing in the event extraction pro-cess to exploit the current semantic and ontologicalcapabilities of the KYOTO technology.141AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported by the the KYOTOproject (STREP European Community ICT-2007-211423) and the Basque Government (IT344-10).ReferencesWauter Bosma, Piek Vossen, Aitor Soroa, German Rigau,Maurizio Tesconi, Andrea Marchetti, Monica Mona-chini and Carlo Aliprandi.
