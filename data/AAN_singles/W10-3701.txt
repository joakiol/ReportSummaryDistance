Proceedings of the Multiword Expressions: From Theory to Applications (MWE 2010), page 1,Beijing, August 2010Being Theoretical is Being Practical:Multiword Units and Terminological Structure RevitalisedKyo KageuraUniversity of Tokyokyo@p.u-tokyo.ac.jp1 Invited Talk AbstractMultiword units (MWUs) are critical in processing and understanding texts and have been extensivelystudied in relation to their occurrences in texts.
MWUs also play an essential role in organising vocab-ulary, which is most prominently visible in domain-specific terminologies.
There has been, however,a limited and mostly theoretical concern with the latter aspect of MWUs; researchers interested inNLP-related applications of terminologies have not paid sufficient attention to this aspect.In this talk I will start by giving the basic framework within which the study of MWUs from the pointof view of vocabulary can be carried out, in the process clarifying the relationships between studiesof MWUs in texts and those in relation to vocabulary.
I will then introduce some of the theoreticalstudies in terminological structure which I have carried out in recent years.
Referring to some of theproblems that practically-oriented research in terminology processing is currently facing, I will arguewhy, how and in what possible ways the understanding of the roles MWUs take in terminologicalstructure constitute a sin qua non condition for making a breakthrough in current text-oriented studiesof terminological MWUs.2 Speaker BiographyKyo Kageura, PhD, is a Professor at the Library and Information Science Course, Graduate School ofEducation, University of Tokyo.
He works in the field of terminology and is interested in applying NLPmethods in constructing practicaly useful reference resources.
His publications include QuantitativeInformatices (Maruzen, 2000, in Japanese) and The Dynamics of Terminology (John Benjamins, 2002).He is currently the editor of the journal Terminology and a book series Terminology and Lexicography:Research and Practice, both published by John Benjamins, with Professor Marie-Claude L?Homme ofthe University of Montreal.
