IntroductionThis paper describes the  na tura l  language da ta  base s t ruc tu reused i n  the  SQ,AP system    we dish Question Answering system).Much o f  t h a t  system i s  already working, but the  paper doesnot only describe the solut ions  t o  solved problems.
D i f f i c u l t i e sand unsolved problems are a l so  presented, since I f e e l  t h i si s  important t o  fu r the r  progress.One of the goals of the  SQAP projec t  was t o  c rea te  a question-answering system capable o f  handllng f a c t s  o f  many d i f f e ren tkinds.
The system should thus not be r e s t r i c t e d  t o  a smallspecial  application area.1.
.
Natural language representat ionThere i s  an obvious need f o r  computers with a capabi l i ty  t oconverse i n  na tura l  human languages.
Natural lmguages aremore general-purpose than most a r t i f i c i a l  languages, whichmeans t h a t  you can t a l k  about a wider subject  a rea  i f  you usenatura l  ldnguages.
Natural languages can be used by everyonewithout specia l  t ra fn ing ,  s o  computers t a lk ing  na tu ra l  languagecan make more people able t o  use more d i f f e ren t  computerf a c i l i t i e s .
F inal ly ,  a r i z i n g  par t  o f  computer usage i n  thefu ture  will be unintelligent processing of na tura l  languaget e x t s ,  and such systems can be improved i f  the processing isnot wholly un in te l l igen t .There a r e  also  wellknown d i f f i c u l t i e s  with na tura l  languagesf o r  computers.
Natural language i s  c lose ly  connected t o  humanknowledge.
Therefore, na tura l  l a n e a g e  sentences can only beunderstood by a m m  o r  a computer with fac tua l  howledge aboutthe subject  matter and with the a b i l i t y  t o  reason w,ith thosefac t s .
To disambiguate such wellknown examples as"The p i g  was i n  the pentf (~ar- ille el 1964) o r  !
!He went t o  thepark with the girlu ( ~ c h a n k  1969) the  computer must have anunderlying knowledge about various kinds of "pens" , about where"the girlw was previously and s o  On.6Also, the same thing can be sa id  i n  many d i f fe ren t  ways, anda computer with natural  language capabi l i t i es  must be able t ounderstand t h i s ,  s o  tha t  fo r  example it can see the s imi lar i tybetween "Find the  mean income of unmarried women with a t  l e a s ttwo bhildren.lf and llSearch through -bhe personell f i l e .
Foreach individual who i s  a w o m a n ,  who i s  not married, and whohas a number of children greater  -khan two,  accumulate incomet o  calculate the  mean.11Theref ore, a computer undexst anding natural  language musthave a data  base with basic fac tual  knowledge about the w o r l di n  general or abouf the subject matter which the compvter i st o  be used f o r .This data  base i s  needed t o  understand ambiguous sentences,but also t o  in te rpre t  the sentences in to  executable dataprocessing commands.The requirements on such a data  base are :- You should be able t o  s to re  a wlde var ie ty  of d i f ferentkinds of  fac t s .
Natural languages are very general-purpose.s o  the data base should also be general-purpose.- You should be able t o  use this data  base t o  make deductions.The capabil i ty t o  do simple and natural  deductions f a s t  i smore important than the capabi l i ty  t o  make very a d v ~ c e d  andlongdrange deductions.
Since the data  base w i l l  be la rge ,  animpor t an t  p a r t  o f  deduction will be the select ion of the re-levant f a c t s  a ~ d  rules out o f  the large mass of facts notneeded f o r  one special  deduction.The data  base can be .more o r  l e s s  close t o  natural  language.A data base c l o s e  t o  natural  language makes input t rans la t ioneas ie r ,  and also the l o s s  of nuances during the input t rans la t ion7w i l l  be smaller .
But the data  base must on the other hand havea logical  structure which i s  sui table  f o r  deduction knd factsearching.One model o f  natural  language knowledge i s  the following: Theknowledge consists of "conceptst1 and of r u l e s  r e l a t i n g  theseconcepts t o  each other.
A typical  concept might be " John1' ,T r A l l  young menrf, ltThe event when John meets M a x y  i n  the pa.rkno r  "The month of July, 1973".
The concepts are re la ted  byru les ,  which can be very simple re la t ions  ( l i k e  the re la t ionbetween "111 young ment1 and the property ffyoungn) or complexpatterns of concepts ( ~ i k e  the ru le  "If Mary i s  weak andt i r e d ,  and she meets a strong b r u t a l  man, then she w i l l  befrightened.")
These rules form a network l inking all conceptstogether.This model o f  natural  language i s  close t o  tha t  often used bypsychologists i n  t ry ing t o  explain the working o f  the intel l igencei n  the human mind.fPhe SQAP system uses a data base of that kind.
The model may atfirst seem simple and straightfbrwazd.
When you try to producea worldng question-a,nsw&ring system, you w i l l  however find thatthere a r e  many difficulties and complications with such a database.
Thia report presents the raBe,% wortant of the problemswe have m e t ,  and in some cases also  our solut ions.
1 believethat o%her producer8 of natural language system w i l l  sooneror  later encounter the same problem, and they may then benefitfrom our experience as presented in this  paper.82, Zntroduution t o  our data base,During the 1960:s, several researchers independently and simul-taneously came up with -&he same basio (idea of organizir@ such adata base - Sandewall 1965, Simmons 1971 , 'Shapiro 1971 .
So6e ofthem were influenced by the caae gqanunar of Fillmore 196'8.The idea is that the data base is organized i n t o  nodes, each noderepresent ing  a  concept .
In na tmal  language,  t h e  prepositionsa r e  used  to , r ep re sen t  s h o r t  s imple and d i r e c t  r e l a t i o n s  betweenconcepts "John i s  - in t h e  bed",  "The fire w a s  lit & MaryttIn  the d a t a  b a s e ,  t h e  i d e a  o f  p r e p o s i t i o n s  i s  extended sothat all aimple a d  d i r e c t  r e l a t i o n s  between concepts  a r er e p r e s e n t e d  by i m p l i c i t  p r e p o s i t i o n s .
( ~ u s t  as you could sayt h a t  t h e r e  i s  a a  i m p l i c i t  p r e p o s i t i o n  Itby" i n  t h e  phrase  "Marylit the fire" .
)Yore complex ru l e s  o r  r e l a t i o n s  between concepts are representedby ex t r a  concepts.
Thus there i s  a concept f o r  the  event ItMaryl i t  the f i re1 '  and t h i s  concept i s  r e l a t e d  t o  "Maryw, Itthe f l r e uand "act  of lightingv i n  a structure like that i n  f igu re  1.Acts of lighting, T CASE#Mary lit the fixe,)Mary) #The firer,Figure 1This s t ruc ture  has four  concepts l inked together by three"prepositiona,lIt relations : CASE, BY and OBJ.
From now on, Iwill i n  this paper c a l l  such r e l a t i o n s  ltshort re la t ionsf1 .The data  base i s  organized so t h a t  t he  deduction r u l e s  canfollow the  shor t  re lakions i n  both d i r ec t ions ,  that i s  gofrom "M+ryI1 t o  ItMary lit the f i r e t 1  o r  from "Ma,z?y l i t  the f irefft o  "Mary".3 .
Objects, events m d  prdicatesNoun phrases i n  natural language usual ly  r e f e r  t o  one o r  as e t  of  objects i n  the  r e a l  world, l i k e  f~Stockholmll o r  " h r e r yhouse lin Swedent1 o r  "The nice m a n  with a bicycle1v.
In oursystem each such concept i s  represented by a node i n  the  data10base ,  which could be c a l l e d  an ob jec t  node.Each o b j e c t  node i s  a s soc i a t ed  w i t h  one o r  more p r e d i c a t enodes express ing  p r o p e r t i e s  of t h a t  objec t .
In  our data base,w e  mark p r e d i c a t e s  w i t h  the  p o s t f i x  ct*Pcr.
Thus, t h e  phrase"An always happy g i r l "  would i n  our  data base be representedl i k e  in figure 2 :HAPPY-P GIRL-P))A happy girl))A statement l i k e  "There is ad a l w a y s  happy g i r l r f  or "One g i r l1 s  always happy" w o u l d  be represented i n  t h e  same way, with anobject node and t w o  s h o r t  r e l a t i o n 6  on ~t t o  t h e  t w o  predicates,ATTR to the a d j e c t i v a l  p r e d i c a t e ,  PRED t o  t h e  nominal p red ica t e .If w e  meet t h e  n a t u r a l  language phrase "One g i r l  i s  n i c etodaytT, then  we cannot r ep re sen t  i t  as simply.
We have t oaffix a t i m e  t o  the r e l a t i o n  between the  girl and HAFPY*Pcc.One way t o  do t h i s  would be t o  always have t h e  a b i l i t y  t o  addertrs short relations to  existing sho r t  r e l a t i o n s ,  !Phis wouldrequire that short  r e l a t i ons  'are represented i n  the data basein a form where there is a place ta add a list o f  extra shos trelat ions,  and this would triple the size of the data base,Tnstead we have an expanded form o f  those s h o r t  r e l a t i o n s  t owhich we want to add other relations, This expanded form xsonly used when it i a  needed, the non-expanded form i s  usedwhen there are no added shor t  r e l a t i o n s ,  The expanded formf o r  the PRED short re la t lon  is a node of  the type "eventtt.WOne girl is happy todayw will thus be repreaented like infigure 3.T CASE Figure 3))One girl is happy today))The advantage of having such an e x t r a  concept i n  the  d a t abase i s  that we can ea s i l y  add more shor t  r e l a t i o n s  t o  t heevent node llOne g i r l  i s  happy t o d q " ,  f o r  example t o  r ep re sen t"in the school" or "becautse of the weather" or "according t ow h a t  Tom said"  .Since we want t o  deal  with t r u e  statements,  hypothet icalstatements and statements belonging to some person's b e l i e fs t r u c t u r e ,  we always add a r e l a t i o n  t o  an event node ind i -c a t i n g  which b e l i e f  s t ruc ture  i t  belongs t o ,  t r u e  events be-long t o  the s e t  "Tfl#3+Sf1 of all t r u e  statements.
Since therelation V A R T  TRUE*Sn is so common, we represent it inpictures with the earth sign of electric charts 1 A .-..The statement "John believes that Mary loves h i m "  would thusbe represented like in figure 4t12))John believes that Mary loves him))BELIEVE-P LOVE-PJohn believes that)) OB 1 ))...Mary loves himnFigure 4Note that there  i s  an ea r th  sign on the true event,  but noe a r t h  s i g n  on the event belonging t o  Johnrs b e l i e f  s t rucWre .Note t h a t  predica tes  and r e l a t i o n s  i n  na tura l  language a reo f ten  not represented d i r e c t l y  as short r e l a t l o n g  i n  ourd a t a  base.

'John i s  the f a t h e r  of Angelica" i s  thus not rep-resented by a shor t  r e l a t i o n  "FATHER" from "Johnv t o  "Angelicavbut ra ther  with an event node like i n  f igure 54FA ER-P r'lmFigure 5 %John is the father of Angelican4 &  Quantifiers on the s h o r t  re1at:ors.Every n o d e  i n  o u r  data base can stand f o r  a s e t  of o b j e c t sinstead of f o r  just a single o b j b c t .
Thus we can represent" A 1 1  n ice  girlsv w i t h  a node represent ing the  s e t  of a l l  nicegirls .This means that we need quantifiers on the shor t  r e l a t i o n s ,t o  be able t o  express re la t ionsh ips  between sets .Tf there is a short re la t ion  R between two s e t s  A and B,then the relamtion R might not  be t rue  between any member ofA and any member of B.
We have several cases:!Fhese and 0 t h ~  cases axe represented in our data basewith three qu.an,tifiers ALL, SOME and ITS, The differencebelmeen SOME and 12% is shown by the difference between Uclesecond w d  the th i rd  example.
One quantifier is placed oneach end of the re l&t ion,  The four  examples above will thusin our data base look 1;ike this rA) (ALL A, R, ALL B)iv) (SOME A, R,*ITS B)14The difference between ITS and SOME can be understood if you lookat t h e  statement 'Wvery man i s  i n  a ca rv  Th i s  can mean thatffEvery m a n  Is i f ls ide  one single car" o r  i t  can mean !
'For e v e r ym a n  there  i s  one car i n  which he i s .
The f i r s t  ph~ase mighti n  our data base be represented  as'%very m a n M  ALL I N  SOMEwhile the second might be represented as"Every m a n u  ALL IN ITT h e ~ e  are simple r u l e s  t o  mmipulate.
the quantifiers when thededuct ion Pules chain f r o m  node t o  n o d e  in the  data base.T h i s  i s  descr ibed  i n  Sandewall 1969.In %he following, if no quantifier is marked on a shor t  re la t ionin a figure, then ALL is i m p l i c i t .155 ,  Deduction in the data baseThe  data base does n o t  contain a l l  t r u e  statements explicitly,some of %hem have t o  be deduced when needed, Basically alldeduction rules can be seen as p a t t e r n  matching, You haue apattern swing for example t ha t  Vf somethipg h o t  is nearsomething inflammable then the irnflammable will catch f i r e " .Then we h'ave sbme actual situation, explicit o r  deduced, e.g.
"The burnine cigaret te  is thrown i n  the p e t r o l  t ankn .
In ourdata base, as in figure 6 .NEAR-PCASEBYn ~ f  something hot is near something inflammable,then the irnflammable will catch fire}),something inflammable,THROW-PCASEINTO > f l h e  burning cigaretterthe petrol tank, is thrown into thepetrol tanknOBJthe cigarette))1, 6Before using t he  deduction r u l e ,  we must match the pattern tot h e  actual s i tua t ion .
The p-at tern can contain many inter-connected r i d e s ,  and t h e  reality may not at first resemblethe p a t t e r n  directly, deduction may be necessary to see theresemblance.The simplest deduction ru le  possible i s  just a p a t t e r n  o ft w o  sho r t  r e l a t i ons  from ,which a third can  be deduced: "IfA R1 B and B R2 C then A R3 C", a simple example: "If A issubset of B ,  and B is subset of C, then A is subset of Ctf.Since such rules l i n k  toge ther  nodes through a chain o f  sho r tr e l a t i o n s ,  they are c a l l e d  chaining rules.
Spme chaining rulesrequire side r e l a t i o n s  on B to the fullfilled, for example"A BY B, and A CASE C implies B R E D  CI1, but only if A is atrue event.This is described in Sandewall 1969 and in Makila 1972.6 .
VariablesThe simplest kind of deduction pattern involves just one node.Such a node i s  calleC a var iab le ,  F o r  example, VARIABLES areuse& in  the translation of 'Wery intelligent man is a badso ld ierv  which is represented l i k e  in f igure 7;INTELLIGENT-P MAN-P TtE TTED DEF BAD-P T ATTR DEF DEF,Every intelligent mann < ALL EQUAL IT #Every bad soldier))sEvety intelligent man is a bad sol diem17Y.a.riables have a new quan t i f i e r  on them, DEF.
This indicatesthat this s h o r t  r e l a t i o n  i s  p a r t  o f  the def in i t ion  of  t h a tvariable.
The var iable  '%very i n t e l l i g e n t  m a n t t  above correspondst o  the s e t  of all objects  which s a t i s f y  the def in i t ion .
T h i smeans that  ad soon as w e  f i n d  an object i n  t he  da ta  base f o rwhich we know o r  can deduce that  i t  s a t i s f i e s  the  d e f i n i t i o n ,t h e n  we know that it be longs  t o  the VARIABLE Above, and w ecan thus deduce tha t  i t  i s  a bad soldier .7.
KeysSometimes the deduction requires a p a t t e r n  of  more than onenode,  Such patterns are  c a l l e d  keys, The sentence "If amotorboat meets a sa i l ingboat ,  then the m o t o r b o a t  must s t e e raway from the  sai l ingboatn w i l l  i n  our data base be representedlike in f igure  8.MOTORBOAT-P>steer away))na motorboat,A T H A TMgF- -- 1  DEFTHAT IFTHEN DEFFROM / THATI DEF PRED \L S AILINGBOAT-PFigure 8nIf a motorboat meets a sailingboat,then the motorboat mdst steer awayfrom tke sailingboatn18To the  left is the  pattern o f  th ree  nodes corinected by sholitrelations w i k h  DEF on b o t h  ends o f  the r e l a t i ons .
This  showst h a t  they are part of a key.
To the r igh t  is the deducedstatement, connected t o  the center  of the  key with an IFTHmshor t  re la t ion .
Note t h a t  there  i s  a new quantifier THAT above.This quantifier means that we should single out just thatactual  object which was matched t o  t h a t  p a r t  of the key.
Wedo not want t o  say t ha t  "Every motorboat meeting a sailingboatmust s t e e r  away from every sai l ingboat  being met by a m o t o r -boa tv ,  and therefore w e  must s ingle  out the matched object only.Natural language sentences often refer t o  previously mentionedent i t i e s  with conetructa l ike  "hew or old  mann.
O u rsystem w & l l  first translate a sentence into an independentdata base f r w e n t .
An assimilation program w i l l  then merget h i s  fragment with the data base.
O t h e r  systems of ten  m&e%his assimilation during the input t rans la t ion .
They mouldthen avoid some, but not all, of our problems, but wouldget  some other problems instead.For this merging we create temporary variables and keysduring input translation.
The sentence "The m a n  always with thegun is in the forestw is thus t rans la ted  i n t o  figure 9:nThe man with the gun is in the forestrGUN-P MAN-PT PRED DEFFOREST-PPREDDEFDEF WITH DEF 'IN>the gunL >>the man )) ' ., )>the forest))19The merging program w i l l  use spec ia l  deduction rules f o r  thesetemporary var iables ,  which we call DUMMIES.
After merging, theD ~ ~ I E S  usually merge with some previous node i n  the data base,and they thus become CONSTANTS o r  VARIABLES depending on t h etype of  that previous node.9.
QuestionsQuestions to a computer can  require short  o r  l o n g  answers.There are for example yes-no questions like rtIs  a man with abalooh coming?"

The necessary data baseconcepts are discussed, rather than the translation problems.Singulm noun phraaes without con Junctions a re  usually t r ans la tedi n t o  one object-type node, A n  exception t o  t h i s  i s  some simplesentences i n  which noun-phrases are t r ans la ted  t o  predicate-typenodes, see chapter 21.This object-type node can be a CONSTUT, a DUMMY o r  a VARIABLE.CONSTANTS are created f o r  simple pos i t ive  sentences l i k e  I1Am a n  i s  walking on a s t r e e t m t f  Note however, t h a t  i n  an i f - s t a t e -ment or  a, quest ion,  the  noun-phrases ins tead must be i n t e r -preted as VARIABGEs, e .

At t r ibutes  on noun phrasesThis s ec t i on  describes things which a r e  not ye t  implementedi n  the  SQAP program when t h i s  i s  wr i t ten  (May 1974)For severa l  reasons, attributes on a noun phrase cannot alwaysbe represented by a d i r ec t  r e l a t i o n  from the noun phrase t othe a t t r i b u t e .Sometimes two o r  more a t t r i b u t e s  on a noun phrase a r e  re la ted.I f  you say ?.riend of Nixonn then t h i s  person i s  n o t  alwaysa f r i end  (he may not be a f r iend of ~ c ~ o v e r n )  and he is notalways "of Nixon" (he may not be "a son of N,ixonv although hei s  sure ly  a son).
If we represented the  two a t t r i b u t e s  tha the is  a f r i end  and t h a t  he i s  "of Nixon" as two separateindependent re la t .
ions  on h i s  object node, then the  data basededuction rules  would not properly understand sentences l i k e"A f r i end  of Nixon is an  enemy of McGovernff.
The deduction25rules would wrongly deduce t h a t  since t h i s  object  independentlyhas the  a t t r i b u t e  of being a f r i end  and t he  a t t r i b u t e  of  being"of McGovernI1, the  object  i s  a f r i end  o f  McGovern.To avoid t h i s  erroneous conclusion we must have only ones ingle  outgoing relation f r o m  the  object  t o  t h e  compositeproperty of being "a f r i e n d  of Nixon".
The statement "A friendof Nixon is an enemy of  McGovernV might thus be representedlike i n  fkgure I 1  bFRIEND-R ENEMY-PHA friend of Nixonu SUBSET ) enemy of McGovernrwhere t w o  new ttevenktt nodes are introduced f o r  being a f r i endof Nixon and being an enemy o f  McGovern.

ANIWI$ DEF $VBSP"TnA big antr > %A small anirndnFigure I l cAnother reason why attributes cannot always be representedas direct relations on the noun i s  t h a t  t h e  a t t r i b u t e  may berestricted in time or space o r  i n  some other way.
If w e  inputthe noun phrase "A hungm g i r l u  then the mmputer creates anobject for this girl.
But we may thereafter learn t h a t  theg i r l  eats and i s  not hungry any more.
Thus t h e  same object,a t  a l a t e r  time, does not any more have the a t t r i b u t e  of beinghungry.
Here again, we must in-kroduce an EVENT pode for thefact that the girl is hungry as shown in figwre l l d .HUNGRY-PAT-TIME..**a GIRL-Pfigure 'lld27In most.
cases, the same time-restriction appliels  t o  attributesas t o  the main verb in the sentence.
If we say "A h u n g q  g i r late a c o l d  buf fe t  in a sundrenched meadow on a w a r m  summerdayw then the  time and space r e s t r i c t i a n s  a r e  valid for allthe attributes on the vqrlous nouns in Che sentence.
In suchm e s ,  the  data base cou1.d be simplified if we introduced aspecial "situationv node t o  represent the  time and space,and then used a new s h m t  relation SIT from the  various eventnodes t o  this situation, This would be even moxe useful if aseries of  sentences all apply t o  the same situation.Prepositional attributes m y  also be situation r e s t r i c t e d  asfor tHe sentence "An angly man with a @;lln is coming at tenolclockvT,  where the man at another time may not be "with a-nu.
This might be represented  as shown in f igu re  I le.ANGRY -P MAN-P%Being an angry m WITHtpa gunw(The situation-restricted event)figure l l e28If the  computer is  t o l d  that "Every english s p i n s t e r  whocomes i n t o  the church i s  awed1' then the computer can deducethat Eliza i s  awed if it knows tha t  Eliza is english, is aspinster, and i s  cornin$ i n t o  the church, all a t  the  same time.13ut i f  E l i z a  was an english s p i n s t e r  f i v e  years ago,  andcomes into the church today, then we cannot make t h l s  deduction.T h i s  can be solved in two ways.
El ther  the  data base represen-tation of  "Every english sp ins t e r  who comes i n t o  the churchi s  awed" i s  changedinto "If at  a c e r t a i n  time, an englishspinster comes i n t o  the  church, then she i s  awed" o r  else thededuction rules a r e  changed s o  t h a t  the time-limitat:ions areimp l i c i t l y  carried a l o n g  and combined during deduction.13.
Composite objectsThere is a need t o  describe the  f a c t  t h a t  objects  can be par t sof other  0bjec .
t~ .
We , therefore introduce the  node type com-posite object.
A composite object consis ts  of a known o r  un-h o w n  number o f  elements, which may o r  m a y  not be similar.If we know which the  elements o f  a composite object  are ,  thenwe use the  ELENIENT shor t  r e l a t i o n  from the composite t o  oneo r  more of i t s  par t s .Example: Vohn and Mary are married."
would be t rans la ted  i n t ef igure  12.JOHN-P MARY -PNAMEDEFMARRIED-PPRED>John and Mary are married,One might suggest that conjunctions between noun phr&ses aretranslated as two sepasate indenpendent o b j e c t  nodes, "Johnand M a z y  axe married" w6uld thus be $ranslated in the samew~ a,s !
'Johq is married and Mary i s  ma,rriedw .
However, t h i si s  &v%ously not  the same thing.
Sometimes the difference i sperhaps not there, f o x  example when we say  "John and Nary  a r ehumanv'.
But the aafest way is t o  create a composite object.This of course requires deduction r u l e s  to decide when a pro-perty on a composite can be transferred t o  i t s  elementary parts.T M s  can almost a l w a y s  be done, but not i n  some oases ,  fo rexample if we say ''John and Mary t-ogether are heavier thanPeter."
But in such cases hhere is usually some indication innatural language, like the word "togetherv indicat ing tha tthe property of the composite cannot be transferred t o  i t selements,Look again at the picture above showing the t r ans la t ion  of"John and M a z y  are married.
"30ALL -the fiodes with DEF on %hem above m e  DUMMIES, This m e a n sthat we first search for a previous-mentioned node with aflWAME: JOHN*Pw r e l a t i o n  on it.

Then the  da ta  base might wrongly iden t i fy  llJohn andM a r y w  i n  the  second sentence with the composite llJohn andMary and *t;heiw sonv1 i n  the  f irst  sentence, and thus wronglyconclude that the son i s  coming along t o  London.
To stop t h i s ,we might require  that i f  there  are ELEMENT r e l a t i o n s  on anode, these must poin t  out all the  elements, and not some o fthem.
Thus the  data base would h o w  that llJohnqf and llMaryllaxe the only elements of the composite "John and M a r y q 1 ,  andtherefore  cannot I d e n t i f y  t h i s  with l1Sohn and Mary and t h e i rsont1 .The data base a l so  ought t o  have a deduction rule which auto-matical ly  can conc'lude that theye i s  a PART r e l a t i o n  betweentwo composites, if all elements of the f irst  composite arealso  elements o f  t he  second,3 114.
Conjunctions between noun phrases i n  the generdl senseIn the previous chapter I pointed out the ambiguity betweensentences l'ike "John and Mary are married" and "John and M a s yare humann where the first sentence says that the compositewas nsrr ied,  while the second said  t ha t  the elements indi-vidually were humans.
I a lso  said tha t  such sentences couldalways be translated t o  composites, since properties ofcomposites can i n  general be trasferred by deduction t o  theelementaq parts.This is not so easy in the general sense, see the followingexamples :"A11 men and women are getting married.
""All men and women, a.re happy.
"Every man and woman standing together are a maxried couple.
"l l A l l  men and women are young people.
"Noun phrases i n  the general sense m e  t rans la ted  i n t o  VARIABLESi n  the data base, and these VARIABIiES are later used duringdeduction.
In most  o f  the sentences above, the best translationis t o  create am indiv idual  variable f o r  each element, but novariable f o r  my composite.
If we s a y  " A l l  men and women arehappyu what we mean i s  "Create a VARIABLE containing all men,and another VARIABLE containing all women, and put the  pro-perty of being happy on all members o f  both var iables .  "
Wedo certainly not m e a n  "Create a VARIABLE of man-human couples,and put the proper ty  of being happy on a l l  such  couple^.^^In the general sense, conjuncted nouns m e  therefore notcombined ihto comwsite objects.
An exception i s  when therei s  some special indication t h a t  such a combination i s  wanted,like the word lltogetherlv i n  the third example sentence above.3215.

Rere the  p l u r a l i t y  is ofl i t t l e  importance, and no composite object  i s  c rea ted  at 51-put t r ans l a t ion .Therefore,  when a p l u r a l  r e f e r s  t o  all objects  with a c e r t a i nproper ty ,  then a v a r i a b l e  i s  c rea t ed ,  but when the  plural nounphrase r e f e r s  t o  some spec ia l  c o l l e c t i o n  o f  o b j e c t s ,  then acomposite objec t  i s  created.W e  introduce t h e  new r e l a t i o n  NTlM which goes f r o m  a compositeob jec t  t o  t he  numeral of it.

This i snecessary e .g .

Fitting composite objec ts  i n to  the  sentenceThe gener@ rule i s  t ha t  when two conjuncted nouns have beent ransla ted i n t o  a composite object ,  then i t  i s  t h i s  compositeobjects and not i t s  pwts which i s  f i t t e d  in to  the sentenceframework.34This i s  obviously the correct  translation e , g ,  when you say"The road  between Stockholm and Gothenburg" where Hbetweenqqrefers t o  the composite, but not t o  the elementary par t ssingularly.

Problems with t he  dual representa-tl,ioa of nounsA s  has been explained above, nouns must sometimes be t rans la tedt o  s ingular  s e t s  ( f o r  special  sense singular nouns), t o  defineds e t s  ( f o r  general sense nouns) o r  t o  composite objects  ( f o rmost p lu ra l  nouns).
This dual i ty  1s n e c e s s w ,  but it alsow i l l  make deduction more d i f f i c u l t ,  since the deduction ru lesmust be able t o  make inferences from: the composite t o  i t spa r t s ,  The deduction ru les  must a l s o  sometimes be able t oc rea te  arudlliary composites o r  audlljlrggr non-composi tes.Example I: "One man and three women are coming.
How many menand how m a n y  women are coming?"
Here, deductian w i l l  probablyhave t o  create a help-composite f o r  the s ingle  man, since ~ n l ycomposites have numeral on tnem, and the question asks f o rt h i s  numeral.Example 11: ?

But i f  we l a t e r  learn,  o r  can deduce from the database, t ha t  it i s  only a single m a n ,  thep a s ingular  non-composite node probably has t o  be created.Example 111: "Soldiers are cme l .

Quantifiers on event nodesConsider the sentence ItA girl 1 s  givlng every man a flower".This sentence could be interpreted in the following way:"There is a set of events, one for each man.
One and thesame girl is giving a different flower in each such event1'.In our data base, this i s  represented like this:MAN-8 (Variable) GIVE-P f as .DEF,a girl)) f- pa girl is givmg .... n (variable) ) FLOWER-sBY DEFk:.TDEF OBJ ITS (Variable)TRUE-Sfigure 37aI n  the  t g m s l a t i o n  above, the  two noun phrases "a girl" and"a flower" are interpreted in different w a y s .
"a girl" i sinterpreted as one single girl, while "a flower" is interpretedas a set of di f feyenl  flowers, one for each man.These two interpretations of "au are c a l l e d  r e spec t ive ly  thesingular sense and the distributed sense.
Other determinersthan Itaft have the same ambiguity, for example "someM.lfa car r f  in the sentence "Every man is in a car" can beinterpreted in the singular sense (one single car) or inthe distributed sense (one car f o r  each man).In the singuhr sense the interpretation will be:figure 37bMAN-S CAR-PPy))Every man is in a car, (Constant)TRUE-S ))a car}} (Constant) PDAnd in the distributed sense the  interpretation will be:MAN-S CAR-PrEvery man is in a carn (Variable) /'$% ITS / DEFTRUE-S ra carp (Variable)figure 37cOne can note t h a t  w e  can later r e f e r  back to the c a r  onlywith the singular sense interpretation.
Example: "Every manis in a car .
The car drove away1'.
This also corresponds t othe  .interpretations in the f igures  above,  where only  thesingular sense prov ides  a node to refer back t o .Such a back-referencing could thus be used to disambiguatethis kind of ambiguous sentence.If you compare t h e  two f igures  above,  an i m p o r t a n t  d i f f e r e n c eis -that -t;he event node is a constant i n  the  singular sense,a variable in t he  distributed sense.The t r a n s l a t i o n  r u l e  i s  t h a t  i f  a l l  the  noun phrases markedwith "a" o r  "some" a r e  t o  be in t e rp re t ed  i n  tke  s ingu la r  sense ,then the event can become a constant .
If, however, one oft he  noun phrases marked with Itat' o r  i s  t o  be i n t e r -p re ted  i n  the  d i s t r ibu ted  sense ,  then we must have one copyof the  event node f o r  each copy o f  t he  d i s t r i b u t e d  noun, s othe event must become a va r i ab le ,I f  the  event i s  t r ans l a t ed  as a var iab le ,  then the  q u a n t i f i e r son t h e  r e l a t i o n s  between the event and t h e  noun phrases should be:DEF-ALL t o  s ingu la r  sense and constant nouns,DEF-ITS t o  d i s t r i b u t e d  sense nouns,ITS-ALL t o  nouns marked with a general q u a n t i f i e r  l i k e  lteverylfo r  "allt1 o r  'leach".Examples :"A man and a woman are  everyone - in t h e  housenna man and a woman) < SAME ITSI \#a man)) ))a woman))))everyone in the house)) (Variable) Fmrthe house)) (Dummy) 1 DEFMAN-P WOMAN-Pfigure 37dJPREDHOUSE-P54"In every city, some woman is in a hospitaluCITY-PCITY -S (Variable)JNSID.WOMAN-S (variable) <- ))is....)) r::ED ITS BY y & g EWOMAN-P HOSPITAL-S (Variable)HOSPITAL-P figure 37e24.

Other often used representationsm ea) Predicate cslculus clauses.b) Exeautable programs in some spacial  programming language.

Here, there is  no previously known man, and theseoond translation w i k h  the pattern key would not match "a manwin the if-ata%ement at all .Horevez, if solution a) i s  adopted, this  text  will not betreated correotly *A man d t h  a dog is ooming.

A more complex algorithm may be necessary t osolve t h i s  problem.Another example which w i l l  cause d i f f i c u l t y  i s"John and h i s  brother  are i n  the wood, H i s  brother  i s  leaving.

"His brotherH i n  the  second sentence w i l l  then iden t i fy  with" H i s  b ro ther ' s  brothern i n  the f i r s t  sentence, which i s  notcorrec t .27.
DUMMIES which re fe r  t o  VARIABLESLook a t  the na tura l  language sentence " I f  a l i o n  meets anelephant, then the  elephant w i l l  run t o  the fores t .
"There are  two DUMMIES i n  the  main clause,  "the elephantv and"the f ores t f t  .
"The e lepbmtv  w i l l  match the VARIABLE createdby "an elephm"ct i n  the  if-clause.
?
'The forestl1 w i l l  match apreviously known, probably CONSTANT fo res t .6 3In  general ,  only a f t e r  doing t h e  refer-back search i n  t h eda ta  base w i l l  we know whether a DUMMY w i l l  match a VARIABLEo r  a 'CONSTANT.I f  a DUMMX matches a VARIABLE, then t h a t  DUMMY may be addingdef in i t i ons  t o  t h a t  VARIABLE.
Look f o r  example a t  the  sen-tence " I f  a l i o n  meets an elephant ,  -and i f  t h e  l i o n  sees  t h eelephant,  then.
.
.
Here, the  DUMMIES i n  the  second phrasew i l l  add t o  t h e  pa t te rn  key being b u i l t  up ,  and thus add t ot h e  de f in i t i ons  of t he  VARIABLES Ifa l i on t r  and "an elephant t f ,This means t h a t  there  are two  kinds of DEF-marked relationson DUMMIES, Phe f i r s t  of them are  those which axe t o  be usedduring the  refer-back search.
And t h e  second a re  those whicha re  t o  be added t o  the  VARIABLE, i f  the  DlJMMY matched avar iab le ,  In our system, we in tend t o  d i s t ingu i sh  betweenthese  by f i r s t  g iv ing the  r e l a t i o n s  which a re  t o  be used i nthe  refer-back search.
Then the  refer-back search i s  done,a d  t h e r e a f t e r  the  r e l a t i o n s  are given which add DEF-s t othe  de f in i t i on  of the  matched VARIABLE.Another i n t e r e s t i n g  case i s  where the re  are two  DUMMIES, onedependent on t h e  o ther ,  and one of them matches a VARJXBLE.Look f o r  example at- the  sentence "If a g i r l  i s  i n  t rouble ,then her  mother w i l l  be angryeff Here, "heru becomes a,n in-depen-dent DUMMY, while Ither mothern becomes a dependent DUMMY.The jtherff DDMEdY w i l l  match the VARIABLE "a g i r l f f  i n  the  if-clause.
The DUMMY Ither motheru w i l l  not f i n d  any match a tall.
And the  i n t e r e s t i n g  t h i n g  i s  t h a t  because the  independentD m  matched a VARIABLE, the dependent DUMMY Ifher mothervwhich matches nothing should i n  t h i s  case not  crea%e a newCONSTANT but a new VARIABLE.
For every d i f f e ren t  g i r l ,  t he rei s  a d i f f e r e n t  mother who will be angry, so a CONS'PBNT w i l lnot do.64This means t h a t  the "the" qwnmy algorithm must be able t odecide i f  a CONSTANT o r  a VARIABLE i s  t o  be created when aDUMMY f ihds  no exp l i c i t  match,28, The problem of dual representationWe have of course during the wri t ing of the SQAP systemencountered many problems, For some o f  them we have foundsolut ions,  f o r  some not ,  Many o f  the problems have &readybeen presented i n  th i s  paper, and those problernswhich belongmore t o  input "canslation o r  -t;o deduction than t o  da t a  bases t ruc ture  do not f i t  i n t o  the subject o f  t h i s  paper,Looking a t  the  problems we have met, there seems t o  be oneproblem which recurs several  times, Th,is i s  the f a c t  t ha tthe  same na tura l  language construct can be represented i nseveral  ways i n  our data  base, We have found t h a t  t h i s  i sunavoidable, since one yepresentation i s  necessary i n  somecases and another i n  other cases.
But on the other hand, t h i sdifference i n  representation w i l l  make the deduction d i f f i c u l t ,including the deduction during the merging of new t e x t  intoa prevfous da ta  base,One solut ion t o  th is  problem i s  t h a t  when there  i s  two d i f fe ren trepresentat ions,  then f o r  sentences giving one o f  them, bothof them is  created includ'ing the relat ionship between them.This solut ion i s  used f o r  the dual i ty  of the representationof nouns.
The noun tfbooku corresponds i n  our da ta  base botht o  the  predioate BOOK*P (=the property of being a book) andt o  the defined s e t  BOOK*S (=the s e t  of a l l  books).
But when-ever BOOK*S i s  crea-bed i n  input t r a s l a t i o n ,  BOOK*P i s  alsocreated and the r e l a t ion  BOOKW DEF PRED BOOK*P i s  created,(1f t h i s  already ex i s t s  i n  the data base, then o f  course thesame th ing i s  not put there twice.
)65This means t h a t  whenever both BOOMP and BOOK*S occurs i n  ourda t a  base, the r e l a t ion  between them a l s o  ex i s t s .Another example where the same solut ion i s  used i s  act iveand passive verbs.
Whenever a  passive predicate ,  e. g. KILLEDXPis  put i n to  the  da ta  base, w e  a lso  put i n  the  act ive formKILL*P and the r e l a t ion  between them: KILL*P PASS KILLEID*P.In t h i s  war we ensure tha t  i f  both KILL%P and KILLED*P arei n  our  data  base, then the r e l a t i o n  PASS between them i sa l s o  there.The same solut ion could be used, but would be cumbers~me andmemoryconsuming i n  o the r  cases.
For example, a  number ofobjects  can be regarded b o t h  as a  composite object  and as as e t ,  f o r  which we have two d i f f e ren t  representation.
Therei s  a  short r e l a t ion ,  OBJCOMPLEX, i n  our system, f rom a compositeobject t o  a  s e t  of a l l  i t s  par ts .
But t h i s  r e l a t i o n  cannotsolve the whole problem, and it  would also be very cumbersomealways t o  have t o  put out both representations f o r  ce r t a inphrases.
This i s  discussed fu r the r  i n  sect ion 19 of t h i spaper.Another problem of t h i s  kind i s  t h a t  our  system i s  very muchbased on the idea  t h a t  simple f a c t s  should be s tored i n  asimple w a y  a d  more complex f a c t s  i n  ,a more complex way.
"Aman is a maJ.en i s  therefore i n  our data  base s tored like i nf igure  43.MAN-P ' > MALE-PSUBPREDBA man is a male))Figure 4366In t h i s  case, a re la t ion  between the predicates was enough.But f o r  the s l igh t ly  more complex statement ffEvery human malei s  a manff, a defined se t  i s  necessary as i n  f igure 44.HUMAN-P MALE-P))Every human male)) ,a> MAN-P))Every human male 1s a man))Figure 44If there i s  some l imi ta t ion  i n  tru-bhfulness o r  v a l i d i t y ,  e.g.a time-limit, then the PRED must be expandad t o  REV BY timesCASE, e.g.

If he i s  humm, then he i salso  a m a n .
"Here, I1helI i n  the second sentence creates an object ,  the database merging routine will f i n d  it d i f f i c u l t  t o  understandt h a t  t h i s  refers t o  the nmalelT i n  $he previous sentence, s incethis  Ivmalett was t ransla ted as a predicate, not as an object,29.
What our system can do and cannot d oOur system can at  l e a s t  par t ly  manage the following naturallanguage constructs: Nouns, a r t i c l e s ,  quant i f iers ,  adject ives ,numerals, rnos-l; pronouns, the conjunction rqandI1 , passive andact ive  verbs, objects,  predicate complements, genitive, pre-posi t ional  a t t r ibu tes  and adverbials, i f-clauses,  yes-noquestions.Some o f  the things w e  a r e  not ready with ye t  are other con-junctions than "andtf, r e l a t ive  pronouns, in terrogat ivepronouns, negation, awcilliazy verbs other than l lben,  com-pazative adjectives.We do not yet  try t o  resolve ambiguity by reference t o  thedata base.The kind of f a c t s  which our system can handle are basical lya passive description o f  a t m e  s e t  o f  f a c t s  about the vorld .We can thus not ye t  handle properly  a description of a  sequenceo f  events changing the world step by s tep.
Neither can wehandle properly facts which are  part of someone's bel iefstructure, Statements about statements cannot be handled ( e .

A shor t  comparison w i t h  other systemsShapiro '1971, Simmons 1971 and others have presented systemsvery s i m 5 .
l ~  to our ,  Most okher systems do not have quant i f ierson the shor t  re la t ions as we have, and we f e e l  t h a t  t h i sis an addition which adda to the power of the rep~esentation.Special in our system may also be t h a t  one s h o r t  relationo m  be extented when necessary into an event.
This savesmuch m e m o r y  compared to repmsenta t ions  where the fullest;form is always used, even though i t  is in most cases notneeded.
It is for example true t h a t  fox a statement liketha t  in figure 3, there may be doube about only t h e  BYrelation, o r  only the AT-TJ3D3 relation, or only the CASErelation.
(we may be sure that g i r l  is happy", but  notso sure about the day, or we rnay be sure  that there ishappiness today, but not sure where. )
A full representationwould therefore require a place t o  insert doubt on myshort relation, whether there is doubt or not, and t h i swould double the data base size.In our  system, the deduction rule can f o r  any node in thedata base f ind a l l  outgoing and incoming s h o r t  relationsdirectly, and fo l low t h e m .
In-spi.t;e of this, w e  can s t o r ea whole s h o r t  relation in j u s t  64 bits(t-o 24-bit adressesplus 16 additional bits).
'Phis compact representationincreases the efficiency of systems storing the database in v i r t u a l  memories.T h e  basic ideas  for our s p t e m  w e r e  i n i t i a l l y  conceived byErik Sandewall and w e r e  presented in his papers  in thebibliography.69Our system was developed as a team-work between me, Er ikSandewall and Kalle Makkil'd.
I have been working with inputt rans la t ion ,  K d l e  Makila with da ta  base managment anddeduction, and Erik Sandewall has guided us i n  our work.It i s  d i f f i cu l t  t o  pinpoint who solved each of  our problems,s h c e  they were solved through discussions from which aso lu t ion  sooner o r  later emerged.S i v  Sjijgren has been working w i t h  the problem of adaptingour system t o  the  swedish and espermto languages,32.
