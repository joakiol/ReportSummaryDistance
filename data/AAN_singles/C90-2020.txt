Synthesizing a large concept hierarchy from French hyperonymsJean Fargues, Adeline l'errin - IBM Paris Scientific C.enter3 et 5 Place Vendome, 75021 Paris Cedex 01, FranceINTRODUCTIONThe KAI,II'SOS prototype we have developed atthe IBM Paris Scientific Center is able to analyzetexts written in l;reneh and to produce a semanticrepresentalion f these texts expressed as a set ofinter-related Conceptual Graphs \[6, 1\].
It uses asemantic lexicon which contains, for each word tobe defined, one or more Conceptual Graphs corre-sponding to one or more meanings of the word.The KAI,IPSOS questkm/answefing system ana-lyzes a Natural l.anguage query, translates it intoConceptual Graphs, performs pattern matchingand deduction on these text graphs to select theanswer, and finally generates a Natural Iangmageanswer fiom the selected answer graphs.We do not detail this KA1JI'SOS system herebecause many papers have already been publishedon it (see the references).
We have chosen topresent recent work \[5\] which has been done onbuilding a large concept hierarchy from an existingpublished ictionary.
More precisely, we have syn-thesized a large semantic network by selectinghYtx'xonyna definitions from th.c "l)ictionnaire duvocabulaire sscntiel - \[,es 5000 roots fondamen-taux" (G. Mator(:, Iarousse, Paris 1963) andcoding them as a set of Prolog clauses awtilable forthe KAI,IPS()S system.Concept type hierarchy andhyperonymyFirst, we must remind you how the concept ypehierarchy is the necessary basis for any use of theConceptual Graph model.
The reader may ofcourse refer to \[6\].
In the Conceptual Graphmodel, the concept ypes are not supposed to bewords but abstract symbols (atoms) used to denotea concept.
Ia'or example, we could have COMMU-NICATION-I~I1OCESS as the concept type thatoccurs in the definition of the verbs "to say", "tocommunicate", "to discuss", etc.
In the same way, apolysemic word like %at" should point on distinctgraphs containing STICK and ANIMAl, as primi-tive concept ypes.
It appears that the concept ypehierarchy must also contain chains like:EI,I;,PlIANT < MAMMAl, < ANIMAl, <I,IVING-III?ING < F, NTITY112Such a concept type hierarchy is necessary todefine the patiern matching algorithms on Concep-tual Graphs which are used to build a graph from aNatural Language sentence by joining the Concep-tual Graphs of its parts.
It is also necessary 1oencode and to verify the preference semantics con-straints in the semantic lexicon.
The concept hier-archy is the basis for the join and projectionalgorithms \[3, 6\] which provide a way to disam-bignate the Natural l~anguage complex sentencesand to perform query/answering on ConceptualGraphs.In the present work, we consider that concepttypes may generaUy be identified to word senses.Thus, the word "bat" poinls on concept typesBAT.
1 and BAT.2 and BAT.
1 < STICK, BAT.2< ANIMAI, is stored in the hierarchy (STICKand ANIMAL being the concept ypes associatedto the main meanings of the words "stick" and"animal").
This implies that the synthesis of a largeconcept ype hierarchy is related to the seleclion ofcorrect hyperonyms.
We give here the logical inter-pretation of the hyperonymy relation between thewords with meanings wl and w2, derived from theone given in \[4\]:w I is hyperonym of w2 ill', for every sentence Strue\[S(w2)\] ~ true\[S(w2/wl)\]where:S(w) stands for a sentence containing an occur-rence of w,S(w2/wl) stands R)r the sentence S(w2) in whichthe occurrence of w2 is replaced by w 1.is the usual logical implication.l:or example, ANIMAl, is hyperonym of I)OGbecause all assertions about a particular dog remaintrue when we substitute "the animal" for "the clog".Of course, this criterkm is not "always verified in asuch formal way.
It is only a guideline.In a Natural Language dictionary, the Natural I,an?guage definitions may be classified hlto a typology,as in \[4\].
For example, all the definitions of theform NP VP may be hyperonym definitions, as in:l'elephant': a very large animal with two tusks anda trunk with which...But NP VP definitions may also be meta def-nitions, as in:'beget': old use to become the father ofor, as an example in l:rench: '~tre': mot qui ddnotela facult6 d'exister.In this paper, we have tried to translate the defi-nitions into English to make it easier to read, butour French dictionary (5,00(1 entries) uses simplerdefinitions than the l,ongman dictionary.
This isthe reason why the reader will nut find a perfectmatch when referring to the Ixmgman.
Further-more, this work depends on the particular dic-tionary (Mator6 l.~mmsse) we adopted but theimportant fact is that the result we have built iscoherent and con'ect.The methodThe method was mainly empMcal: it was not soclear that the information contained in the dic-tionary would be useful for synthesizing a large andcoherent concept hierarchy.
We will return to thisimportant point later.
But we must  add that thebuilding of a large concept hierarchy from naturallangmat,e definitions has limits.
For example, itcannot be a simple hierarchy but a hierarchy inwhich the links are labeled by conceptual relationslike part-of, set-of, etc.
Another limit is that tiletheoretical transitivity of the hyperonymy relationcan only be verified on a chain of word senses ifthe chain is not too long.
It should be noted thatwe were particularly interested in the top part ofthe hierarchy, i.e.
in the list of the basic conceptsfrom whicla all the others may be derived.
Themethod, a bottom-up one, was carried out in tilefollowing stages:1.
The hyperonymy definitions were selected fromthe dictionary (by hand).2.
The meanings of the words, in the entries andin the definitions, were distinguished by intro-ducing a coherent subscript notation for thecurrent word and the main noun of its deft-nifion (by hand).3.
The relation between the current meaning ofthe word and its hyperonym were encoded as al'rolog clause (by hand).4.
Ixmps were suppressed by the application ofProlog consistency checking programs thatintroduced an additional syuonymous relationbetween concepts.
We mean here that whenwl < w2 and w2 < wl are found, we declareas a l'rolog clause that SYNONYM(wl,w2).5. t'rolog programs were applied to the result inorder to display it in a suitable way (see appen-dices A and B), and to have associative accessto this data from Prolog.There is a difference between simple hypemnymdefinitions and compound hyperonym definitions.A simple hyperonym definition has the syntacticpattern N + VP..., or N +RF, I,ATIVF,-CI,AUSE...
In this case we choose Nas the hyperonym of the current word, if it is acorrect hyperonym.
A compound hypemnym deft-nition has the syntactic pattern:NP VP..., where NP has the form:1.
N AI),IL;CTIVI~:2.

Ensemble de N (set of N)8.

Element de N (element of N).In all these cases, we keep the informalion con-tained in the NP and we code it into Prolog asfollows:?
Case 1: we include the adjective in the frsthyperonym and we derive a secondary hyper-onym, h)r example:F, lephant: A large animal ....1;,I ,F, PI IA NT < I ,ARGE-ANIMAI,  <ANIMAl,?
Case 2: we keep the compound noun as tilefirst hyperonym and we generate its secomla Whyperonym, for example:l)oute: Etat d'esprit ....(Doubt: Stale of mind ...)t)OUTE.

Cases 3 to 24: we consider that the relation is aprimitive conceptual relation which labels tilehyperonymy link in the concept hierarchy, forexample:lnfanterie: ensemble de troupes ...(Infantry: set of troops ...)INFANTERIE  <ENSEMBI,E- I)E(TROUI~E.

!,CISION < AC.T1ON-DE(CHOISIR) <ACTION-DI_ ~, < ACTIONTiffs last case implies that the result is more than asimple hierarchy: from a formM point of view it isa semantic network because of the use of primitiverelations ACT-OF, PART-OI;,  SET-OF etc.The result shows that there are 57 main hierarchies.We give the corresponding table containing the topconcepts and the number of sons they have.
In all,more than 3,600 word meanings have been codedinto the network.
Please see Table 1 Before theAppendices.This restflt is not homogenous: some hierarchiescontain many nodes and tile others a few nodes.We can consider that:?
Some hierarchies correspond to fundamentaltypes:-- Etre (being)- Chose (thing)- Fait (fact)- Action (action)- Substance (substance)- Quantit6 (quantity)- Mani~re (manner)- l;orce (strength)- Son (sound)- Feu (fire)Other hierarchies correspond to logical types:- Motif (motive)- Cons6quence (consequence)- Fonction.2 (function)- Lien (link)- Manque (lack)- Absence (absence)- El6ment (element)- Nombre (number)- degr6 (degree)Other hierarchies correspondconcepts:to topological- Borne (boundary)- Bordure (edge)- Direction (direction)- Dimension (dimension)- Espace (space)- Intervalle (interval)- Contenu (content)- Volume (volume)?
The remaining hierarchies correspond to otherisolated types and contain fewer concepts thanthe preceding ones.
They are also pertinent butit is surprising to obtain some of them as basicgenetic oncepts.Another remark must be made on tile transitivityof the ' < '  hyperonymy relation.
It appears that ina chain w l < w2 < ... < wn, it is possible to con-sider that each relation wi < wi+ 1 is justified.Nevertheless, it is more difficult to justify wl <wn.
For example, consider the chain:TOMBE < FOSSE < TROU < OUVER-TURE.2 < PASSAGE.2 < LIEU < PAR-"1"II~,.
I(ESPACE)grave < pit < hole < opening < passage <location < part-of(space) (we give tiffs translation,but it is very difficult to keep the exact nuances ofthe French chain).In this chain, each contiguous relation is justified,but to justify tile link between 'grave' and part-of(space) requires specifying the point of view thatis taken.
In fact, we have reached the limits of theprocess of building a concept hierarchy fromexisting dictionaries.Appendix A contains an extract of the hyperonymdictionary we obtained (for the meanings of wordsbeginning with G) and Appendix B contains anextract of the hierarchy whose top concept isCI IOSE (thing).i14 3 3Tops'6tre' (being)'action' (action)'autorit6' (authority)'bien' (good)'bordure' (edge)'coiffure' (hairstyle)'coup.
