Knowledge, Intention, Rhetoric: Levels of Vm'iation in MultilingualInstructionsJudy Delin* Donia Scott t Tony Hart ley $I n t roduct ionInstructional texts are designed by an Origiua.tor (0) to enable a User (U) to l)el'fornl a tasksafely, efficiently, and correctly.
The starting point for the construction of such a text is a setof underlying intentions relating to the actions that U is intended to perfi:)rm.
This needs to I)eexpressed in the text in a gra.mma.tica.1 and pragmatically eflhctiw; way.
Amdysis of multilingmdtexts, however, indicates that what is pragmatically eflk~ctive in one languag(, may not be what ispreferred in another.
Our research has concentrated on the task of delineating which parts of thetext production process are open to this sort of variation, and which parts follow directly fromthe task structure that is the shared representation for all the languages.
The multilingual datahas enabled us to tease out six levels of representa.tion at which variability can and does arise.This makes the picture, for instruction generation at least, rather more complex than any simplemapping between task structure and discourse structure can hope to apl)roximate.What are the levels it is useful to distinguish?
We suggest hey are as tbllows:The knowledge of  the ar tefact  A flmctional model of the arteffil,ct and its mode of operationin terms of actions and sta,tes;The deep intent ions The rel)resentk)n of the originator's intention that the user I)erform thesequence of actions that constitute a l)articular ta.sk involviltg the artefa.ct;The knowledge selected for communicat ion  What is to be communica,ted about the artefactand the task that will enable the users to perfornt he apl~rol)ria.te actions, based on a.ssump-tions about their cultural 1)ackground, world knowledge, and expertis(,;The shal low intent ions A representation of the goals that the text has to achieve in order tomotivate the required tasks;The rhetor ica l  s t ruc ture  The discourse strategy/ies chosen to achieve the text's goMs; and*School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences, University of Sussex (email: jmlycO!cogs.sussex.ac.uk)tInformation Technology Research Institute, University of Brighton (emaih donia.scottCg)itri.bton.ac.uk)tThe Language Centre, University of Brighton (email: aflt(@wns.bton.ac.uk)7The syntact ic  s t ruc ture  The syntax expressing the chosen rhetorica.l structure.We focus here on three of the M)ove levels: deep intentions, shallow intentions and rhetorical struc-ture, and we will 1)resent evidence fl'om multilingual instructions that SUl)lml'ts this differentiationof levels of description hy highlighting the variability that exists between them.
It is clear that,whatever the l)rinciples are for relating them, the mapl)ing froln one level to another is not a simpleone-to-one corresl)on(lelice.
But why suggest wo levels of intentions, a, nd wha.t are they like?Two Levels  of  In tent ionsEvery set of instructions is the realisation of a l)rogranHne of actions that the user is requiredto perform: the deep intent ions of the originator.
In multilingual document generation, thisprogra.mme is necessarily indel)endent of the la.nguage(s) in which the instructions are expressed.Intentions at this level do not specify linguistic acts to be performed; ra.ther, they are intentionsfor the user to perform concrete actions.
Intentions at this level might therefore be rel)resented ashierarchically- organised sequences of statements like i'ute'uds(O, do( U, actioni)).This level of action requirements often does not ma l) directly onto the tinal text, and may not evenhe expressed explicitly in it.
It does not correspond to a text plan; ra.ther, it is the action planwhich motivates the text and as such is 1)ut one of several a.vaila.ble resources fi)r the text planner.For example, instructions which include all the actions required to achieve a goal, even those whichthe user reasonMfly couhl be expected to infer, are not usually (lesirable (see di Eugenio \[1992\]).This level of intentions relates Mmost directly to that presented by Grosz a.nd Sidner \[1986:201\] intheir discussion of what they term the action casc.
The ma.ill (lif\[brence between our deep intentionsand those that form Grosz and Sidner's discoursc p'u17Jo.~?.s (DPs) a.lld dise'oursc sr:gmc:nt pu77~oses(DSPs) is that we have so far found it sufficient lot our purposes to illclude at this level oldy theorigim~tor's intentions with respect o user actions, and not user 1)elicit.In l)roducing instructions the originator also has other intentions, which relate to the way(s) inwhich he/she will convey the action requirements o the user.
This leads us to propose a secondlevel of intentionality, that of shal low intent ions,  where the 1)articular flmctions to be fiflfilled bythe discourse are specitied.Consider the following siml)le scenario where the intention of the origilmtor is for the user of anelectronic organiser to turn on the machine by pressing the ON Imtton.
The deep intentions wouldthus I)e as follows:(1) intend,s(O, do(U, tu'rnonmach, i', ,:))intend,s( O , do( U, FressO N button ))The intention for tlLe user to turn on tile machine is at a higher level in the intentional structurethan the intention for the user to press the button (This might be captured, using Grosz an(ISidner's terlns, as a DOMINATES relation holding between the higher and lower intentions).The originator of the instruction may t'(~el tha.t it is sufficient simply to instrucl, the user t,o turn onthe machine, or to press the ON button.
This would lead t(~ a. sha.llow intention corresponding to:8(2) intends(O, inform(O, U, do( U, turuo,t,,~,,teh.inc ) ) )in the case of the former, and(3) intends(O, inform(O, U, do(U, pre~.sONbutto,O))The information th,%t originators choose to convey in instructions, however, is not `%lw~ws thisbasic: users are not simply told what to do.
Good instructions `%llow tile user to develop `% fullerunderstanding of what they ,%re doiltg through the provision of infol'm`%tion such `%s the rel`%tionshipbetween the required actions `%nd their expected efI~cts.
Deep intentio,ls may l.hus le`%d to otherpossible shallow intentions uch as the ibllowing:(4) intend.~(O, inform(O, U,'why- to(p','es.~ONbutton)))(5) intends(O, inform(O, U, how - to( turnonmachine ) ) )The choice of fina.1 expression (including the choice of coherence rel`%tion) will be`%r %` direct rel,%tionto choices at the level of sh,%llow intentions, ,%nd not deep intention.
In the tollowing multilingu`%linstructions (taken from an instruction m`%ml` %l for %` hotne exercise steplfing m`%chine) the deepintention is the same: tha.t the user baJ`%nce the a.ppar`%tus by turning the milled wheel.
Ilowever,the shallow intentions chosen for tile different l`%ngu`%ges are not the s`%me: it, tile English ` %ndGerman versions, the user is tohl how to bal`%nce the a.plm.r,%tus , while the French user is tohlwhy the milled wheel needs to be turned.
These differing shallow intentions directly constrain tilechoice of coherence rel,%tion: ,%n analysis in terms of RST, for ex`%mple, would lead us to assignENABLEMENT to the Germ`%n a.nd English versions, but PURPOSE to the French:(6) The ` %l)p`%r`%tus can 1)e b`%l`%nced on unev(m floors by turning the milledwheel.

Although this suggestion cle`%rlytakes us closer to ,% solution to the l`%ck of delicacy in the ch`%r~tcteris`%l.iolt of ltST rela.tions, weshould be c,%refifl to agree on ` % useful nomencl`%ture th`%t does not itself permit new confusions toarise.
We hope th,%t he workshop will provide an opportunity for cla.ritying these issues.
*It is also important o point out the similarity between,his level of descriptiou aml the type of informationcaptured by theEFFEOT field of rhetorical relrttions in RSTSummary and ImplicationsWe suggest hese six levels of representation to rellect what we have observed in the analysis ofmultilingual instructions.
At tile basic level, parallel instructional texts are in some sense 'thesame', in that they are intended to achieve the same effect--i.e., these texts are CONGRUENT atthe level of deep intentions.
However, this level alone is not sufficient o account for the observedvariability between congruent texts.
For example, we wouhl expect the same rhetorical relationto l)e chosen in each language tbr a given (leep intention, and as we have shown, this is not thecase.
What underpins the choice of rhetorical relation (among other l)ragmatic onstraints) is theintermediate l vel of shallow intentions: tile rhetorical goals selected for the actual text.
Coherencerelations are chosen to SUpl)ort these sha.ll()w intentions.
The corolla.ry of this is that any analysisof the coherence rela.tiolls present in a text will not reveal the (leel~ intentions underlying tha.t text(its 'message', so to slmak), since tim levels ~1" va.ria.I)ility w~, ha,w~ d~,scril)ed here (Io m~t a.llow sucha straightforward eal)ping.The multilinguM data prevents this assuml)tion tha,t the ma.ppings between these levels are simple,since it shows how much w~.riability there may be between one lew~l of rel)resentation a d the nextfor different languages.
However, it shouhl not be assumed that the six levels we 1)repose are strictlyserially ordered in terms of deciding how t(i present a text ia a. given language.
As in any processrelated to language production, a decision at one level m;ly be inlluenced by fa.cts several evelsabove or below.With respect o the translation of instructional texts, it seems clear to us that the interface betweenshMlow intentions and discourse relations plays a critical role in determining the naturalness andappropriateness of the target text.
It is highly likely that the nature of the wtriation occurring atthis level is language-dependent, wi h the result that the decisions taken in the l)roduction of thesource text may not be al)l)ropriate for the target.
As far as we km:)w, this level of representationis not exploited in current MT systems.Our data suggest hat capturing the variability between congruent exts is a rich area for inves-tigation, and one that sheds light on the levels of intention and rhetoric that underpin discourse.We suggest hat such a study not only points to advances in theory, but to advances in MT andM-NLG in the production of pragmatically apl)rol)riate instructional texts.Referencesdi Eugenio, B \[1992\] Understanding Natural Language Instruct,loll.y: '1'1.-' (",~ of l:'urpose.
