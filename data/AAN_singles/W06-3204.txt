Proceedings of the Eighth Meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Phonology at HLT-NAACL 2006, page 31,New York City, USA, June 2006. c?2006 Association for Computational LinguisticsInvited Talk:Universal Constraint Rankings Result from Learning and EvolutionPaul BoersmaInstitute of Phonetic SciencesUniversity of AmsterdamHerengracht 3381016CG Amsterdam, The Netherlandspaul.boersma@uva.nlAbstractOptimality Theory has met with a bad press in the more emergentist (e.g.
computational) lit-erature for its reliance on innate constraints and even on innate constraint rankings (positionalfaithfulness, licensing by cue).
In this talk I will show with computer simulations that even ifthe learner?s initial grammar starts with a large number of constraints that have no inherent biastowards unmarked or otherwise good sound systems, the learner will gradually turn the constraintranking into something resembling a universally unmarked sound system as an automatic resultof input frequencies and imperfections of the transmission channel.
It turns out that the parents?sound system is ?semi-learnable?
: if the parents?
sound system happens to be universally marked,the offspring will learn to mimic the quirks of this system to some extent, but they will tendto turn the language into a universally unmarked sound system within three generations or so.The conclusion will be that a bidirectional Optimality-Theoretic model of the grammar with twophonological and two phonetic representations is compatible with the view that there is no innatephonological substance in language acquisition.31
