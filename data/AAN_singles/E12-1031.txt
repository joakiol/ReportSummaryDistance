In this paper we beginto address this problem by building a novel,color-emotion-concept association lexiconvia crowdsourcing.
This lexicon, which wecall CLEX, has over 2,300 color terms, over3,000 affect terms and almost 2,000 con-cepts.
We investigate the relation betweencolor and concept, and color and emotion,reinforcing results from previous studies, aswell as discovering new associations.
Wealso investigate cross-cultural differences incolor-emotion associations between US andIndia-based annotators.1 IntroductionPeople typically use color terms to describe thevisual characteristics of objects, and certain col-ors often have strong associations with particu-lar objects, e.g., blue - sky, white - snow.
How-ever, people also take advantage of color terms tostrengthen their messages and convey emotions innatural interactions (Jacobson and Bender, 1996;Hardin and Maffi, 1997).
Colors are both indica-tive of and have an effect on our feelings and emo-tions.
Some colors are associated with positiveemotions, e.g., joy, trust and admiration and somewith negative emotions, e.g., aggressiveness, fear,boredom and sadness (Ortony et al 1988).Given the importance of color and visual de-scriptions in conveying emotion, obtaining adeeper understanding of the associations betweencolors, concepts and emotions may be helpful formany tasks in language understanding and gener-ation.
A detailed set of color-concept-emotion as-sociations (e.g., brown - darkness - boredom; red -blood - anger) could be quite useful for sentimentanalysis, for example, in helping to understandwhat emotion a newspaper article, a fairy tale, ora tweet is trying to evoke (Alm et al 2005; Mo-hammad, 2011b; Kouloumpis et al 2011).
Color-concept-emotion associations may also be usefulfor textual entailment, and for machine translationas a source of paraphrasing.Color-concept-emotion associations also havethe potential to enhance human-computer inter-actions in many real- and virtual-world domains,e.g., online shopping, and avatar construction ingaming environments.
Such knowledge may al-low for clearer and hopefully more natural de-scriptions by users, for example searching fora sky-blue shirt rather than blue or light blueshirt.
Our long term goal is to use color-emotion-concept associations to enrich dialog systemswith information that will help them generatemore appropriate responses to users?
differentemotional states.This work introduces a new lexicon of color-concept-emotion associations, created throughcrowdsourcing.
We call this lexicon CLEX1.
Itis comparable in size to only two known lexi-cons: WORDNET-AFFECT (Strapparava and Val-itutti, 2004) and EMOLEX (Mohammad and Tur-ney, 2010).
In contrast to the development ofthese lexicons, we do not restrict our annotatorsto a particular set of emotions.
This allows us to1Available for download at:http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/Questions about the data and the access process may besent to svitlana@jhu.edu306collect more linguistically rich color-concept an-notations associated with mood, cognitive state,behavior and attitude.
We also do not have anyrestrictions on color naming, which helps us todiscover a rich lexicon of color terms and collo-cations that represent various hues, darkness, sat-uration and other natural language collocations.We also perform a comprehensive analysis ofthe data by investigating several questions includ-ing: What affect terms are evoked by a certaincolor, e.g., positive vs. negative?
What con-cepts are frequently associated with a particularcolor?
What is the distribution of part-of-speechtags over concepts and affect terms in the data col-lected without any preselected set of affect termsand concepts?
What affect terms are strongly as-sociated with a certain concept or a category ofconcepts and is there any correlation with a se-mantic orientation of a concept?Finally, we share our experience collecting thedata using crowdsourcing, describe advantagesand disadvantages as well as the strategies weused to ensure high quality annotations.2 Related WorkInterestingly, some color-concept associationsvary by culture and are influenced by the tra-ditions and beliefs of a society.
As shown in(Sable and Akcay, 2010) green represents dangerin Malaysia, envy in Belgium, love and happinessin Japan; red is associated with luck in China andDenmark, but with bad luck in Nigeria and Ger-many and reflects ambition and desire in India.Some expressions involving colors share thesame meaning across many languages.
For in-stance, white heat or red heat (the state of highphysical and mental tension), blue-blood (an aris-tocrat, royalty), white-collar or blue collar (of-fice clerks).
However, there are some expres-sions where color associations differ across lan-guages, e.g., British or Italian black eye becomesblue in Germany, purple in Spain and black-butterin France; your French, Italian and English neigh-bors are green with envy while Germans are yel-low with envy (Bortoli and Maroto, 2001).There has been little academic work on con-structing color-concept and color-emotion lexi-cons.
The work most closely related to ourscollects concept-color (Mohammad, 2011c) andconcept-emotion (EMOLEX) associations, bothrelying on crowdsourcing.
His project involvedcollecting color and emotion annotations for10,170 word-sense pairs from Macquarie The-saurus2.
They analyzed their annotations, lookingfor associations with the 11 basic color terms fromBerlin and Key (1988).
The set of emotion labelsused in their annotations was restricted to the setof 8 basic emotions proposed by Plutchik (1980).Their annotators were restricted to the US, andproduced 4.45 annotations per word-sense pair onaverage.There is also a commercial project from Cym-bolism3 to collect concept-color associations.
Ithas 561,261 annotations for a restricted set of 256concepts, mainly nouns, adjectives and adverbs.Other work on collecting emotional aspectof concepts includes WordNet-Affect (WNA)(Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004), the General En-quirer (GI) (Stone et al 1966), Affective Formsof English Words (Bradley and Lang, 1999) andElliott?s Affective Reasoner (Elliott, 1992).The WNA lexicon is a set of affect terms fromWordNet (Miller, 1995).
It contains emotions,cognitive states, personality traits, behavior, at-titude and feelings, e.g., joy, doubt, competitive,cry, indifference, pain.
Total of 289 affect termswere manually extracted, but later the lexicon wasextended using WordNet semantic relationships.WNA covers 1903 affect terms - 539 nouns, 517adjectives, 238 verbs and 15 adverbs.The General Enquirer covers 11,788 conceptslabeled with 182 category labels including cer-tain affect categories (e.g., pleasure, arousal, feel-ing, pain) in addition to positive/negative seman-tic orientation for concepts4.Affective Forms of English Words is a workwhich describes a manually collected set of nor-mative emotional ratings for 1K English wordsthat are rated in terms of emotional arousal (rang-ing from calm to excited), affective valence (rang-ing from pleasant to unpleasant) and dominance(ranging from in control to dominated).Elliott?s Affective Reasoner is a collection ofprograms that is able to reason about human emo-tions.
The system covers a set of 26 emotion cat-egories from Ortony et al1988).Kaya (2004) and Strapparava and Ozbal (2010)both have worked on inferring emotions associ-ated with colors using semantic similarity.
Their2http://www.macquarieonline.com.au3http://www.cymbolism.com/4http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/?inquirer/307research found that Americans perceive red as ex-citement, yellow as cheer, purple as dignity andassociate blue with comfort and security.
Otherresearch includes that geared toward discoveringculture-specific color-concept associations (Gage,1993) and color preference, for example, in chil-dren vs. adults (Ou et al 2011).3 Data CollectionIn order to collect color-concept and color-emotion associations, we use Amazon Mechani-cal Turk5.
It is a fast and relatively inexpensiveway to get a large amount of data from many cul-tures all over the world.3.1 MTurk and Data QualityAmazon Mechanical Turk is a crowdsourcingplatform that has been extensively used for ob-taining low-cost human annotations for variouslinguistic tasks over the last few years (Callison-Burch, 2009).
The quality of the data obtainedfrom non-expert annotators, also referred to asworkers or turkers, was investigated by Snow etal (2008).
Their empirical results show that thequality of non-expert annotations is comparableto the quality of expert annotations on a variety ofnatural language tasks, but the cost of the annota-tion is much lower.There are various quality control strategies thatcan be used to ensure annotation quality.
For in-stance, one can restrict a ?crowd?
by creating apilot task that allows only workers who passedthe task to proceed with annotations (Chen andDolan, 2011).
In addition, new quality controlmechanisms have been recently introduced e.g.,Masters.
They are groups of workers who aretrusted for their consistent high quality annota-tions, but to employ them costs more.Our task required direct natural language in-put from workers and did not include any mul-tiple choice questions (which tend to attract morecheating).
Thus, we limited our quality control ef-forts to (1) checking for empty input fields and (2)blocking copy/paste functionality on a form.
Wedid not ask workers to complete any qualificationtasks because it is impossible to have gold stan-dard answers for color-emotion and color-conceptassociations.
In addition, we limited our crowd to5http://www.mturk.coma set of trusted workers who had been consistentlyworking on similar tasks for us.3.2 Task DesignOur task was designed to collect a linguisticallyrich set of color terms, emotions, and conceptsthat were associated with a large set of colors,specifically the 152 RGB values corresponding tofacial features of cartoon human avatars.
In to-tal we had 36 colors for hair/eyebrows, 18 foreyes, 27 for lips, 26 for eye shadows, 27 for fa-cial mask and 18 for skin.
These data is necessaryto achieve our long-term goal which is to modelnatural human-computer interactions in a virtualworld domain such as the avatar editor.We designed two MTurk tasks.
For Task 1, weshowed a swatch for one RGB value and asked50 workers to name the color, describe emotionsthis color evokes and define a set of concepts as-sociated with that color.
For Task 2, we showed aparticular facial feature and a swatch in a particu-lar color, and asked 50 workers to name the colorand describe the concepts and emotions associ-ated with that color.
Figure 1 shows what wouldbe presented to worker for Task 2.Q1.
How would you name this color?Q2.
What emotion does this color evoke?Q3.
What concepts do you associate with it?Figure 1: Example of MTurk Task 2.
Task 1 is thesame except that only a swatch is given.The design that we suggested has a minor lim-itation in that a color swatch may display differ-ently on different monitors.
However, we hope toovercome this issue by collecting 50 annotationsper RGB value.

In total, 915workers (41% male, 51% female and 8% who didnot specify), mainly from India and United States,completed our tasks as shown in Table 1.
18%workers produced 20 or more annotations.

In thesections below we discuss our findings on colornaming, color-emotion and color-concept associ-ations.
We also give a comparison of annotatedaffect terms and concepts from CLEX and otherexisting lexicons.4.1 Color TermsBerlin and Kay (1988) state that as languagesevolve they acquire new color terms in a strictchronological order.
When a language has onlytwo colors they are white (light, warm) and black(dark, cold).
English is considered to have 11 ba-sic colors: white, black, red, green, yellow, blue,brown, pink, purple, orange and gray, which isknown as the B&K order.In addition, colors can be distinguished along atmost three independent dimensions of hue (olive,orange), darkness (dark, light, medium), satura-tion (grayish, vivid), and brightness (deep, pale)(Mojsilovic, 2002).
Interestingly, we observethese dimensions in CLEX by looking for B&Kcolor terms and their frequent collocations.
Wepresent the top 10 color collocations for the B&Kcolors in Table 2.
As can be seen, color termstruly are distinguished by darkness, saturation andbrightness terms e.g., light, dark, greenish, deep.In addition, we find that color terms are also as-sociated with color-specific collocations, e.g., skyblue, chocolate brown, pea green, salmon pink,carrot orange.
These collocations were producedby annotators to describe the color of particularRGB values.
We investigate these color-conceptassociations in more details in Section 4.3.In total, the CLEX has 2,315 unique colorColor Co-occurrences?white off, antique, half, dark, black, bone,milky, pale, pure, silver0.62black light, blackish brown, brownish,brown, jet, dark, green, off, ash,blackish grey0.43red dark, light, dish brown, brick, or-ange, brown, indian, dish, crimson,bright0.59green dark, light, olive, yellow, lime, for-est, sea, dark olive, pea, dirty0.54yellow light, dark, green, pale, golden,brown, mustard, orange, deep,bright0.63blue light, sky, dark, royal, navy, baby,grey, purple, cornflower, violet0.55brown dark, light, chocolate, saddle, red-dish, coffee, pale, deep, red,medium0.67pink dark, light, hot, pale, salmon, baby,deep, rose, coral, bright0.55purple light, dark, deep, blue, bright,medium, pink, pinkish, bluish,pretty0.69orange light, burnt, red, dark, yellow,brown, brownish, pale, bright, car-rot0.68gray dark, light, blue, brown, charcoal,leaden, greenish, grayish blue, pale,grayish brown0.62Table 2: Top 10 color term collocations for the11 B&K colors; co-occurrences are sorted by fre-quency from left to right in a decreasing order;?101 p(?

Theinter-annotator agreement rate on color naming isshown in Table 3.
We report free-marginal Kappa(Randolph, 2005) because we did not force an-notators to assign certain number of RGB valuesto a certain number of color terms.
Additionally,we report inter-annotator agreement for an exactstring match e.g., purple, green and a substringmatch e.g., pale yellow = yellow = golden yellow.4.2 Color-Emotion AssociationsIn total, the CLEX lexicon has 3,397 unique af-fect terms representing feelings (calm, pleasure),emotions (joy, love, anxiety), attitudes (indiffer-ence, caution), and mood (anger, amusement).The affect terms in CLEX include the 8 basic emo-tions from (Plutchik, 1980): joy, sadness, anger,fear, disgust, surprise, trust and anticipation6CLEX is a very rich lexicon because we did notrestrict our annotators to any specific set of affectterms.
A wide range of parts-of-speech are rep-resented, as shown in the first column in Table 4.For instance, the term love is represented by othersemantically related terms such as: lovely, loved,loveliness, loveless, love-able and the term joy isrepresented as enjoy, enjoyable, enjoyment, joy-ful, joyfulness, overjoyed.POS Affect Terms, % Concepts, %Nouns 79 52Adjectives 12 29Adverbs 3 5Verbs 6 12Table 4: Main syntactic categories for affect termsand concepts in CLEX.The manually constructed portion ofWORDNET-AFFECT includes 101 positiveand 188 negative affect terms (Strapparava and6The set of 8 Plutchik?s emotions is a superset of emotionsfrom (Ekman, 1992).Valitutti, 2004).
Of this set, 41% appeared atleast once in CLEX.
We also looked specificallyat the set of terms labeled as emotions in theWORDNET-AFFECT hierarchy.
Of these, 12 arepositive emotions and 10 are negative emotions.We found that 9 out of 12 positive emotionterms (except self-pride, levity and fearlessness)and 9 out of 10 negative emotion terms (except in-gratitude) also appear in CLEX as shown in Table5.
Thus, we can conclude that annotators do notassociate any colors with self-pride, levity, fear-lessness and ingratitude.
In addition, some emo-tions were associated more frequently with colorsthan others.
For instance, positive emotions likecalmness, joy, love are more frequent in CLEXthan expectation and ingratitude; negative emo-tions like sadness, fear are more frequent thanshame, humility and daze.Positive Freq.

Emotions aresorted by frequency in decreasing order from thetotal 27,802 annotations.Next, we analyze the color-emotion associ-ations in CLEX in more detail and comparethem with the only other publicly-available color-emotion lexicon, EMOLEX.
Recall that EMOLEX(Mohammad, 2011a) has 11 B&K colors associ-ated with 8 basic positive and negative emotionsfrom (Plutchik, 1980).
Affect terms in CLEX arenot labeled as conveying positive or negative emo-tions.
Instead, we use the overlapping 289 affectterms between WORDNET-AFFECT and CLEXand propagate labels from WORDNET-AFFECT tothe corresponding affect terms in CLEX.
As a re-sult we discover positive and negative affect termassociations with the 11 B&K colors.
Table 6shows the percentage of positive and negative af-fect term associations with colors for both CLEXand EMOLEX.310Positive NegativeCLEX EL CLEX ELwhite 2.5 20.1 0.3 2.9black 0.6 3.9 9.3 28.3red 1.7 8.0 8.2 21.6green 3.3 15.5 2.7 4.7yellow 3.0 10.8 0.7 6.9blue 5.9 12.0 1.6 4.1brown 6.5 4.8 7.6 9.4pink 5.6 7.8 1.1 1.2purple 3.1 5.7 1.8 2.5orange 1.6 5.4 1.7 3.8gray 1.0 5.7 3.6 14.1Table 6: The percentage of affect terms associatedwith B&K colors in CLEX and EMOLEX (similarcolor-emotion associations are shown in bold).The percentage of color-emotion associationsin CLEX and EMOLEX differs because the set ofaffect terms in CLEX consists of 289 positive andnegative affect terms compared to 8 affect termsin EMOLEX.
Nevertheless, we observe the samepattern as (Mohammad, 2011a) for negative emo-tions.
They are associated with black, red andgray colors, except yellow becomes a color ofpositive emotions in CLEX.
Moreover, we foundthe associations with the color brown to be am-biguous as it was associated with both positiveand negative emotions.
In addition, we did not ob-serve strong associations between white and pos-itive emotions.
This may be because white is thecolor of grief in India.
The rest of the positiveemotions follow the EMOLEX pattern and are as-sociated with green, pink, blue and purple colors.Next, we perform a detailed comparison be-tween CLEX and EMOLEX color-emotion asso-ciations for the 11 B&K colors and the 8 basicemotions from (Plutchik, 1980) in Table 7.
Recallthat annotations in EMOLEX are done by workersfrom the USA only.
Thus, we report two num-bers for CLEX - annotations from workers fromthe USA (CA) and all annotations (C).
We takeEMOLEX results from (Mohammad, 2011c).
Weobserve a strong correlation between CLEX andEMOLEX affect lexicons for some color-emotionassociations.
For instance, anger has a strong as-sociation with red and brown, anticipation withgreen, fear with black, joy with pink, sadnesswith black, brown and gray, surprise with yel-low and orange, and finally, trust is associatedwith blue and brown.
Nonetheless, we also founda disagreement in color-emotion associations be-tween CLEX and EMOLEX.
For instance antic-ipation is associated with orange in CLEX com-pared to white, red or yellow in EMOLEX.
We alsofound quite a few inconsistent associations withthe disgust emotion.
This inconsistency may beexplained by several reasons: (a) EMOLEX asso-ciates emotions with colors through concepts, butCLEX has color-emotion associations obtaineddirectly from annotators; (b) CLEX has 3,397affect terms compared to 8 basic emotions inEMOLEX.
Therefore, it may be introducing someambiguous color-emotion associations.Finally, we investigate cross-cultural differ-ences in color-emotion associations between thetwo most representative groups of our annotators:US-based and India-based.
We consider the 8Plutchik?s emotions and allow associations withall possible color terms (rather than only 11 B&Kcolors).
We show top 5 colors associated withemotions for two groups of annotators in Figure 2.For example, we found that US-based annotatorsassociate pink with joy, dark brown with trust vs.India-based annotators who associate yellow withjoy and blue with trust.4.3 Color-Concept AssociationsIn total, workers annotated the 152 RGB valueswith 37,693 concepts which is on average 2.47concepts compared to 1.82 affect term per anno-tation.
CLEX contains 1,957 unique concepts in-cluding 1,667 nouns, 23 verbs, 28 adjectives, and12 adverbs.
We investigate an overlap of con-cepts by part-of-speech tag between CLEX andother lexicons including EMOLEX (EL), Affec-tive Norms of English Words (AN), General In-quirer (GI).
The results are shown in Table 8.Finally, we generate concept clusters associ-ated with yellow, white and brown colors in Fig-ure 3.
From the clusters, we observe the mostfrequent k concepts associated with these colorshave a correlation with either positive or negativeemotion.
For example, white is frequently associ-ated with snow, milk, cloud and all of these con-cepts evolve positive emotions.
This observationhelps resolve the ambiguity in color-emotion as-sociations we found in Table 7.5 ConclusionsWe have described a large-scale crowdsourcingeffort aimed at constructing a rich color-emotion-311white black red green yellow blue brown pink purple orange greyangerC - 3.6 43.4 0.3 0.3 0.3 3.3 0.6 0.3 1.5 2.1CA - 3.8 40.6 0.8 - - 4.5 - 0.8 2.3 0.8EA 2.1 30.7 32.4 5.0 5.0 2.4 6.6 0.5 2.3 2.5 9.9sadnessC 0.3 24.0 0.3 0.6 0.3 4.2 11.4 0.3 2.2 0.3 10.3CA - 22.2 - 0.6 - 5.3 9.4 - 4.1 - 12.3EA 3.0 36.0 18.6 3.4 5.4 5.8 7.1 0.5 1.4 2.1 16.1fearC 0.8 43.0 8.9 2.0 1.2 0.4 6.1 0.4 0.8 0.4 2.0CA - 29.5 10.5 3.2 1.1 - 3.2 - 1.1 1.1 4.2EA 4.5 31.8 25.0 3.5 6.9 3.0 6.1 1.3 2.3 3.3 11.8disgustC - 2.3 1.1 11.2 1.1 1.1 24.7 1.1 3.4 1.1 -CA - - - 14.8 1.8 - 33.3 - 1.8 - -EA 2.0 33.7 24.9 4.8 5.5 1.9 9.7 1.1 1.8 3.5 10.5joyC 1.0 0.2 0.2 3.4 5.7 4.2 4.2 9.1 4.4 4.0 0.6CA 0.9 - 0.3 3.3 4.5 4.8 2.7 10.6 4.2 3.9 0.6EA 21.8 2.2 7.4 14.1 13.4 11.3 3.1 11.1 6.3 5.8 2.8trustC - - 1.2 3.5 1.2 17.4 8.1 1.2 1.2 5.8 1.2CA - - 3.0 6.1 3.0 3.0 9.1 - - 3.0 3.0EA 22.0 6.3 8.4 14.2 8.3 14.4 5.9 5.5 4.9 3.8 5.8surpriseC - - - 3.3 6.7 6.7 3.3 3.3 6.7 13.3 3.3CA - - - - 5.6 5.6 - 5.6 11.1 11.1 -EA 11.0 13.4 21.0 8.3 13.5 5.2 3.4 5.2 4.1 5.6 8.8anticipationC - - - 5.3 5.3 - 5.3 5.3 - 15.8 5.3CA - - - - - - - 10.0 - 10.0 10.0EA 16.2 7.5 11.5 16.2 10.7 9.5 5.7 5.9 3.1 4.9 8.4Table 7: The percentage of the 8 basic emotions associated with 11 B&K colors in CLEX vs.

This lexiconlinks concepts, color terms and emotions to spe-cific RGB values.
This lexicon may help to dis-ambiguate objects when modeling conversationalinteractions in many domains.
We have examinedthe association between color terms and positiveor negative emotions.Our work also investigated cross-cultural dif-ferences in color-emotion associations betweenIndia- and US-based annotators.
We identifiedfrequent color-concept associations, which sug-gests that concepts associated with a particularcolor may express the same sentiment as the color.Our future work includes applying statisticalinference for discovering a hidden structure ofconcept-emotion associations.
Moreover, auto-matically identifying the strength of associationbetween a particular concept and emotions is an-other task which is more difficult than just iden-tifying the polarity of the word.
