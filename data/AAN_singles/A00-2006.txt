S. CataldoGhezzano 56010 (PI) - ITALYpisa@ilc.pi.cnr.itAbstractThe goal of this paper is to describe how theEuroWordNet framework for representinglexical meaning is being modified within anItalian National Project in order to includeinformation on adjectives.
The focus is onthe 'new' semantic relations being encodedand on the revisions we have made to theEuroWordNet Top Ontology structure.
Wealso briefly discuss the utility of theinformation which is being encoded forcomputational pplications.Int roduct ionThe Princeton WordNet (henceforth WN) is alexical semantic network in which the meaningsof words are represented in terms of theirconceptual and lexical relations to other words.The basic notion around which it is developed isthat of a synset (synonyms et), i.e.
a set ofwords with the same Part-of-Speech (PoS) thatcan be interchanged in a certain context.
Variousconceptual and lexical relations are thenencoded between synsets of the same PoS: e.g.,hyponymy, antonymy, meronymy, etc.
(Miller etal.
1990; Fellbaum 1998b).Within the EuroWordNet (henceforth EWN)project I a similar (multilingual) lexical resourcewas developed, retaining the basic underlyingdesign of WN, but enriching the set of lexical-semantic relations to be encoded for nouns andverbs in various ways 2, in order to obtain amaximally re-usable resource for computationalapplications.
Thus, a) cross-PoS (xPos) relationswere added so that different surface realizationsof similar concepts within and across languagescould be matched (e.g., the noun research andthe verb to research could be linked as1 EWN was a project in the EC LanguageEngineering (LE-4003 and LE-8328) programme.
Ina first phase, the partners involved were theUniversity of Amsterdam (coordinator); the Istitutodi Linguistica Computazionale, CNR, Pisa; theFundacion Universidad Empresa (a cooperation ofUNED, Madrid, Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona,and the University of Barcelona); the University ofSheffield; and Novell Linguistic Development(Antwerp), changed to Lemout & Hauspie during theproject.
In a further phase, the database was extendedwith German, French, Estonian and Czech.
Completeinformation on EWN can be found at its web site:http://www.hum.uva.nl/~ewn/.2 Adjectives and adverbs were encoded in EWN onlyas targets of relations from nouns and verbs.&9 42'XPOS NEAR__SYNONYMS' in EWN); b) somerelations were identified which provide detailedinformation on semantic omponents lexicalizedwithin word roots (e.g., to hammer could belinked to the noun hammer by means of an'INVOLVED_INSTRUMENT' relation); c) somelabels were distinguished which could be addedto relations to make their semantic entailmentsmore explicit and precise (cf.
Alonge et al1998).
The links among the wordnets ofdifferent languages were realized by means of anInterlingual-Index (ILI), constituted by anunstructured list of the Princeton WN (version1.5) synsets.
In addition, a hierarchy oflanguage-independent concepts, reflectingfundamental semantic distinctions (e.g., Objectand Substance, Dynamic and Static, Cause,Manner, etc.
), was built: the Top Ontology(TO).
The TO consists of language-independentfeatures which may (or may not) be lexicalizedin various ways, or according to differentpatterns, in different languages (Rodriguez et al1998).
Via the ILI, all the concepts in themonolingual wordnets are directly or indirectlylinked to the TO.
The following picture showsthe EWN data structure (see also Vossen 1999):While in WN all PoSs are represented, in EWNdetailed information was encoded only for nounsand verbs and no analysis was carried out withrespect to lexical-semantic relations which couldbe used to describe the semantics of adjectivesand adverbs.
In an Italian National Project weare building a large wordnet, ltalWordNet(henceforth IWN) 3, by extending the networkbuilt for Italian in EWN.
Thus, we are bothincreasing the coverage for nouns and verbs andadding adjectives and some adverbs 4.To be ableto encode information on adjectives we haveenriched the set of the EWN lexical-semanticrelations, aiming at encoding data which can beuseful for computational applications.
Moreover,we have revised the TO in order to account forthe semantics of the new lexical categories beingencoded.In this paper we describe the main changes madeto the EWN framework in order to encodeinformation on adjectives in IWN.
Firstly, weprovide a brief overview of the WN treatment ofadjectives.
Then, we discuss the set of relationsbeing encoded for this category in IWN.
Finally,we show the integration made to the EWN TO.We then conclude the paper by adding someremarks on the utility of the data being encodedfor computational applications.1 Adjectives in WNIn WN adjectives are divided into two majorclasses: descriptive adjectives and relationaladjectives.
A descriptive adjective is "one thatascribes a value of an attribute to a noun"(Fellbaum et al 1993:27).
Descriptive adjectivescombine with nouns to express ome qualities ofthe thing, person or concept they designate.Typically, in this group we find adjectives thatdesignate the physical dimension of an object,its weight, abstract values etc.
Besides thesereferent-modifying adjectives, we also findreference-modifying adjectives (cf.
Bolinger1967; Chierchia & McConnel-Ginet 1990 namethem intensional adjectives).
Typical examplesof the latter are former, future, present.3 ItalWordNet will be the reference l xical resourceamong various integrated language resources andsoftware tools for the automatic treatment of heItalian written and spoken language which are beingdeveloped within the SI-TAL ('Integrated System forthe Automatic Treatment of Language') NationalProject.4 Actually, we shall only encode adverbs derivedfrom adjectives by adding the suffix -mente, forwhich a derivation relation with an adjective will beencoded.43Relational adjectives, on the other hand, meansomething like "relating/pertaining to, associatedwith", and usually have a morphologicallystrong link with a noun.
Typical examples aremusical, atomic, chemical 5.Synonymy is the basic relation encoded for allthe PoSs (since it is used to build synsets).While in WN the noun and verb networks arethen mainly developed around the superordinate(hyper/hyponymy) relationship, the organizationof descriptive adjectives can "be visualized interms of barbell-like structures, with a directantonym in the centre of each disk surroundedby its semantically similar adjectives (whichconstitute the indirect antonyms of the adjectivesin the opposed disk)" (Fellbaum 1998a: 212).The main relation encoded for these adjectivesynsets is antonymy, claimed to be the mostprominent relation, both from a psycholinguisticpoint of view and from a more strictly lexical-semantic one, in the definition of the semanticsof descriptive adjectives.
Hyponymy issubstituted by a 'similarity' relation.Relational adjectives, on the contrary, are notorganized in this way, because their semanticscannot be described by using these relations.Indeed, they only point to the noun to whichthey pertain (e.g.
atomic is linked to atom).Finally, information on the selectionalpreferences of both descriptive and relationaladjectives is sometimes encoded (e.g., betweenhigh and degree), by using an 'is_attribute_of'relation.2 The IWN relations for adjectivesAs for the other lexical categories, also in IWNthe basic relation encoded for adjectives issynonymy, on the basis of which synsets arebuilt.
Following EWN, we also encode aNEAR._SYNONYMY relation when two synsets arevery close in meaning but their members cannotbe put in the same synset (and no other relationresults appropriate to link them; see Alonge ets Note that some adjectives have both a descriptivesense and a relational one.
For example, musicale(musical) can modify the noun voce (voice) when wewant to say that a voice is sweet-sounding andmelodious, but can also be combined with the nounstrumento (instrument) when we want to indicate thatan instrument can be used to produce music.al.
1998 for a discussion of this relation, andAlonge et al, in prep., for a complete anddetailed discussion of the linguistic design ofIWN).
Then, we encode a number of additionalrelations, which have been identified by takinginto consideration i) theoretical works; ii) theEAGLES recommendations on semanticencoding (cf.
Sanfilippo et al 1999); iii) the dataavailable in our sources; iv) possible use of dataencoded in computational pplications.2.1 HyponymyTogether with synonymy, the hyponymy relationconstitutes the 'bone structure' of both WN andEWN.
However, as we have seen, in WN thepossibility of encoding hyponymy for adjectivesis denied and the basic relation encoded foradjectives is antonymy, while EWN did notreally deal with adjectives and a completenetwork for them was not built.Within IWN we have reconsidered thepossibility of encoding hyponymy for adjectives.By analysing data coming from machine-readable dictionaries we find subsets ofadjectives which have a genus + differentiadefinition, like nouns or verbs.
That is, theseadjectives seem to be organised into classessharing a superordinate.
This is the case, e.g., ofadjectives indicating a 'containing' property(acquoso - watery; alcalino - alkaline), or a'suitable-for' property (difensivo - defensive;educativo - educational), etc.
In IWN we havedecided, therefore, to encode hyponymy also forthese sets of adjectives.
The taxonomies whichcan be built on the basis of this relation aredifferent from those built for nouns or verbs,since they are generally very flat, consistingalmost always of two levels only (an exceptionis the color adjectives taxonomy).
However, byencoding a hyponymy relation for theseadjectives, we obtain classes for which it will bepossible to make various inferences.
Forinstance, it will be possible to infer semanticpreferences of certain classes: e.g., all theadjectives occurring in the taxonomy ofcontenente (containing) will occur as attributesof concrete nouns; adjectives found in thetaxonomy of affetto (affected by an illness) willnever be predicated of nouns referring toobjects, etc.
Furthermore, it will also be possibleto infer information on syntactic haracteristics/I/11 44of adjectives found in the same taxonomy: e.g.,the hyponyrns of atto (suitable for) are alwaysfound in predicative position (and do not acceptany complements); the hyponyms of privo(lacking) may occur both in attributive and inpredicative position (and may take certainprepositional complements), etc.As it was done for all the relations identified inEWN, we have built substition tests ordiagnostic frames based on normalityjudgements (cf.
Cruse 1986).
Inserting twowords in the test sentences built evokes a'normality'/ 'abnormality' judgement on thebasis of which each relation can be determined.These tests are used by encoders both to verifythe existence of relations between synsets and toencode them in a consistent way (for a completelists of the tests built see Alonge et al, in prep.
)2.2 AntonymyAs in WN, also in IWN the antonymy relationremains an important relation to describe thesemantics of various adjectives.
Followingtheoretical work (Lyons 1977; Cruse 1986), wehave further distinguished betweenCOMPLEMENTARY ANTONYMY and GRADABLEANTONYMY 6.
The former relation linksadjectives referring to opposing properties/concepts: when one holds the other is excluded(alive~dead).
The latter relation is used for thoseantonym pairs which refer to gradable properties(long~short).
In case it is not clear if twoopposing adjectives refer to complementary orgradable properties, we can still use anunderspecified ANTONYMY relation.
Also thisinformation can be useful for computationalapplications ince word pairs presenting one ofthe two kinds of opposition may occur indifferent contexts (cf.
Cruse 1986).2.3 Other  relationsIn WN a relation between adjectives and nounsis encoded for relational adjectives which pointto a noun to which they 'pertain': atomic~atom,industrial~industry, etc.
This relation will beencoded also in IWN, by using the labelPERTAINS TO.Another relation 'inherited' from WN can beuseful to distinguish both adjective senses andtheir semantic preferences7:altol (tall) IS A VALUE OF statura (stature)alto2 (high) IS_A_VALUEOF altezza (height).Other relations are then being encoded which arenot in WN, but are encoded for nouns and verbsin EWN.
In WN each PoS forms a separatesystem of language-internal relations andconceptually close concepts are totally separatedonly because they differ in PoS.
In EWN, insteadof using as main classificatory criterion thetraditional distinction among PoSs, drawn uponheterogeneous criteria, a purely semanticdistinction was adopted (following Lyons 1977).Thus, a distinction was drawn among I st orderentities (loes - referred to by concrete nouns),2 "d order entities (2oes - referred to by verbs,adjectives or nouns indicating properties, states,processes or events), and 3 rd order entities (3oesreferred to by abstract nouns indicatingpropositions existing independently of time andspace).
By drawing this distinction it waspossible to relate lexical items that, either withina language or across different languages, refer toclose concepts, although they belong to differentPoSs.
Thus, as said above, the possibility toencode 'near-synonymy' between synsets of thesame order (but different PoSs) was provided.Furthermore, other cross-PoS relations wereidentified which allow to obtain a betterdescription of word meanings.
In IWN wemaintain the same distinction among semanticorders and encode for adjectives ome relationswhich can be encoded for the other 2oes.
Inparticular, we encode the 'INVOLVED' and'CAUSE' relations.The INVOLVED relation links a 2oes with a loeor 3oe referring to a concept incorporated within6 A similar distinction is also made within theSIMPLE EC project (LE-8346), whose goal is addingsemantic information to the set of harmonizedlexicons built within the PAROLE project for twelveEuropean languages.
Of course, the sub-classificationofantonymy can also be used for nouns and verbs.7 Furthermore, these relations being encoded betweenan adjectival synset and a nominal or verbal one arealso useful to distinguish adjective classes asdescribed by Dixon (1991), and reported inSanfilippo et al (1999).
Indeed, such classes areoften indicated by the nouns linked to adjectives.45 45the meaning of the 2oe 8.
Examples for adjectivesare given in the following:filoso (= pieno di fili) (thready, filamentous)HAS_HYPERONYM pieno (full)INVOLVED filo (thread)imberbe (= privo di barba) (beardless)HAS_HYPERONYM privo (lacking)INVOLVED barba (beard).Another relation which can be encoded is theCAUSE relation:depuratorio (= atto a depurare) (depurative,purifying)HAS_HYPERONYM atto, adatto(suitable for)CAUSES non-factive 9 depurare(to purify)compensativo (= che serve a compensare)(compensatory)HAS._HYPERONYM alto, adatto(suitable for)CAUSES non-factive compensare(to compensate)A new relation, not present either in WN or inEWN, will be encoded for a class of adjectivesindicating the possibility of some eventsoccurring:giudicabile (= che pub essere giudicato) (triable)LIABLE_TO giudicare (to judge)inaccostabile, inavvicinabile (= che non pub essereavvicinato) (which cannot be approached)LIABLETO awicinare, accostare(to approach) negative.8 E.g., to lapidate has as INVOLVED_INSTRUMENTstone; to work has as INVOLVED_AGENT worker (seeAlonge et al 1998).9 As said above, in EWN various features wereencoded to make implications of relations explicit:conjunction and disjunction (for multiple relations ofthe same kind encoded for a synset); non-factivity (toindicate that a causal relation does not necessarilyapply); intention (added to a cause relation to indicateintention to cause a certain result); negation (toexplicitly encode the impossibility of a relationoccurring).
These features are also used in IWN.The table below gives an overview of the mainrelations being encoded for adjectives in IWN(for the other relations being encoded foradjectives ee Alonge et al, in prep.

Situation Type: the event-structure orAktionsart (or lexical aspect) of a situation;?
Situation Components: the most salientsemantic components that characterizesituations.The Situation Types provide a classification of2oes in terms of the event-structure (orAktionsart) of the situation they refer to: a basicdistinction was drawn between Static andDynamic.
The Situation Components represent amore conceptual and intuitive classification ofword meanings because they can be viewed likethe most salient semantic components of aconcept.
Examples of Situation Componentsare: Manner, Existence, Communication, Cause.Situation Type represents disjoint features thatcannot be combined, whereas it is possible toassign any combination of SituationComponents to a word meaning.
Here below theTop Concepts identified for 2oes are shown:46 462 ND ORDER ENTITYSITUATION COMPONENTCauseCommunicationConditionExistenceExperienceLocationMannerMentalModalPhysicalPossessionPurposeQuantitySocialTimeSITUATION TYPEDynamicBoundedEventUnboundedEventStaticPropertyRelationIn order to be able to draw generalizations onadjective meanings by using the TO, wepartially modified this scheme.
First of all, wemoved the PROPERTY and RELATION nodesunder the SITUATION COMPONENT node.
Thiswas done for two interconnected reasons: first ofall, because this distinction is not directly linkedto Aktionsart (lexical aspect), while thedistinctions under SITUATION TYPE areAktionsart distinctions, i.e.
they are connectedwith the "the procedural characteristics (i.e.
the'phasal structure', time extension' and 'mannerof development') ascribed to any given situationreferred to by a verb phrase" (Bache 1982: 70) ~?.Secondly, adjectives may refer to PROPERTIES orRELATIONS, but they may be either stative or not(cfr.
e.g.
Lakoff 1966; Quirk et al 1985; Peterset al 1999).
Thus, in our system it has to bepossible to specify that an adjective xpresses aPROPERTY while being DYNAMIC.
In any case,since many adjectives may have both aDYNAMIC sense and a STATIC one, we have alsothe possibility to under-specify this informationIo Of course, in EWN all 2oes (and therefore alsonouns or adjectives) can be classified according totheir Aktionsart.by linking adjectives directly to the SITUATIONTYPE node.Adjectives may indicate many different types ofproperties: temporal (passeggiata mattutina -morning walk), psychological (canzone triste -sad song), social (uomo ricco - rich man),physical (superficie legnosa - wooden surface),physiological (bambino magro - thin child),perceptive (minestra calda hot soup),quantitative (magra r icompensa - poor reward)and intensity properties (vino for te  - strongwine).
In the EWN TO there are already nodeswhich may be used to represent thesedistinctions (TIME, MENTAL, SOCIAL, PHYSICAL,QUANTITY) but we needed to better specify oralso add some features.
For example, we haveadded, under the already present nodePHYSICAL, the node MATERIAL, to represent,among others, some Italian adjectives ending in-oso  (for example legnoso - wooden, acquoso -watery) which indicate the property ofcontaining a certain material.
Moreover, weadded the node PHYSIOLOGICAL (to classifyadjectives corresponding to tired, hungry, sick,etc.)
under PHYSICAL.
For adjectives denoting anintensity, we then added the node INTENSITYdirectly under the SITUATION COMPONENT node.One of the main problem we had was that noTop Concept in the EWN TO could be used toclassify the reference-modifying adjectives (cf.above).
These are a very particular kind ofadjectives, because they do not indicate aproperty of the referent of the noun they modify.So, aiming at showing the distinction betweenreferent-modifiers and reference-modifiers, wecreated two new Top Concepts under the nodePROPERTY: ATTRIBUTE and FUNCTIONAL, wherethe latter can be used for reference-modifyingadjectives (according to the definition providedby Chierchia & McConnel-Ginet 1990 for thecategory referred to by these adjectives: "afunction f rom propert ies to properties").Like all descriptive adjectives, also thereference-modifiers classified under the nodeFUNCTIONAL can be linked to other SITUATIONCOMPONENTS.
Functional adjectives for whichthe temporal aspect prevails (ex former,presente - present) can be classified under thenode TIME; adjectives referring to some'epistemological' property (potenzialepotential, necessario - necessary) can be linked&7 47tO MODAL 11; etc.
A particular case of functionaladjectives are the 'argumental' ones.
Theyintroduce a comparison between differententities (e.g., simile - similar, diverso - different,etc.).
A comparison presupposes a relationbetween different entities o these adjectives canbe linked to both PROPERTY and RELATION.Since in the EWN TO these two Top Conceptswere two different kinds of SITUATION TYPE,they were mutually exclusive; now, in the IWNrevised TO they can be conjoined.Here below the IWN Top Concepts for 2 "a OrderEntities are shown:2 N?

Let's take into consideration justa few examples.The adjective depresso is ambiguous in that ithas (at least) three readings:1) which has been lowered, flattened (said of aland);2) being in bad physical or moral conditions (saidof an area, a country);3) affected by depression (said of a person).For these three senses of the adjective we wouldencode different relations, extractable from oursources:depressol IS_CAUSEDBY deprimere (to lower)IS A VALUE_OF terreno (land)depresso2depress%HAS_HYPERONYM colpito (affected)IS_CAUSEDBY depressionel(depression - economic sense)HAS_HYPERONYM affetto(affected, suffering from sthg.
)IS_CAUSED_BY depressione2(depression - medical sense)The relations encoded could, e.g., helpdisambiguate he occurrences of the adjective incontexts uch as: Gianni era depresso (Gianniwas depressed) or Quella regione ~ depressa(That area is depressed).
Indeed, by checking thesemantic information encoded for the two sensesof depressione linked to depresso, it's possibleto provide the right interpretation for thesentences under analysis; on the other hand, thefirst sense of the adjective would be excludedbecause of the IS A VALUE OF relationencoded.
In this case, also the TO links could behelpful: actually, depresso2 would be linked toSOCIAL and CONDITION, while depresso3 wouldbe linked to MENTAL and EXPERIENCE.Many adjectives found in our sources do notseem to have (lexicalized) antonyms, nor cannotbe defined by using the PERTAINS_TO orIS A VALUE OF relations.
These are oftenlinked to nouns or verbs, by various relations:/ IQ  48piumato = coperto di piume (plumed = covered withplumage)HAS HYPERONYM copertoINVOLVED piumadistillabile =che pub essere distillato (distillable =which can be distilled)LIABLE TO distillare.For these and many other adjectives the 'new'relations identified in IWN are necessary, giventhat we often cannot encode other relations forthem.
The relations encoded providefundamental semantic information on them,which can, for instance, be used to infersemantic preferences (e.g., only certain loes canbe modified by piumato, etc.).
The inclusion ofthis information in a large database which ismainly intended for computational pplicationscan be very useful, mainly because it may helpin resolving ambiguities and may be used todraw inferences of different nature.ReferencesAlonge A., Calzolari N., Vossen P., Bloksma L.,CasteUon I., Marti T., Peters W.
