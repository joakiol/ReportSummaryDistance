However, multi-wordtranslation units (MWTU) such as idioms,compound words, etc., need an n-to-mmapping, and their component words oftendo not appear adjacently, resulting in adiscontinuous MWTU.
During translation,the MWTU should be treated as one lexicalitem rather than a phrase.
In this paper, wedefine the types of MWTUs and proposetheir representation a d recognition methoddepending on their characteristics inKorean-to-Japanese MT system.
In anexperimental evaluation, the proposedmethod turned out to be very effective inhandling MWTUs, showing an averagerecognition accuracy of 98.4% and a fastrecognition time.1 IntroductionAs a transfer problem in a machinetranslation (MT), lexical and structuraldifferences exist between source and targetlanguages, which requires l-n, m-n, or n-1mapping strategies for machine translationsystem.
For such mapping strategies, we need totreat several (n, or m) words (or morphemes) asa single translation unit.
Although someresearches (D.Santos,1990; Linden E.,1990;Yoon Sung Hoe, 1992; Ha Gyu Lee, 1994;D.Arnold,1994) employ the term "idiom" forthese units, we prefer MWTU (Multi-WordTranslation Unit) because it is a more generaland broader term for MT environment.Up to now, some reseamh as focused onrecognition and transfer of MWTUs, althoughvery little research has been undertaken forKorean-to-Japanese machine translation systems(Seen-He Kim,1997).
In previous researches,some tended to simplify the problem by treatingonly special types of MWTUs, while others hadsome recognition errors and took too muchrecognition time because they did not restrict herecognition scope (D.Santos,1990; Yoon SungHee,1992; Ha Gyu Lee, 1994; Seen-HeKim, 1997).For a Korean-to-English MT, Lee and Kim(Ha Gyu Lee,1994) uses only weak restrictionslike adjacent inforlnation for recognition scope.However, their method needs strongerrestrictions to resolve recognition errors and tospeed up the process.
Although some differencesexist depending on which kinds of source andtarget languages are dealt with, MWTUs inKorean-to-Japanese MT frequently have theircomponent words close together, so that one canpredict he location of their separated componentwords.
For this reason, we can enhance therecognition accuracy and time effectively byrestricting the recognition scope according to thecharacteristics of an MWTU rather than takingthe whole sentence as the scope.Moreover, the method by Lee and Kim (HaGyu Lee,1994) deals with only surface-levelconsistency without considering word orderbecause Korean has ahnost free word order.
It isobvious that the method can deal with variable544word-order MWTUs, but some incorrectrecognition results arc possible whcn meaningchanges according to word order.
BecauseMWTUs to be treated in Korean-to-JapaneseMT have an almost fixed word order sequence,their meaning may vary if the word order ischanged.
In (1), both sentences have the samelexical words (or morphemes), but while the firstsentence must be treated as an MWTU, thesecond, which has the different sequence fromthe first, does not have the meaning of anMWTU.
In (1), the words surrounded with a boxare an essential component morpheme for anMWTU.
(big) (nose) (get hurt)/*(1) had a b i t~)er ience  */(nose) (get hurt) (big)/* It is serious (that I) got hurt in my nose */In this paper, to solve the word orderproblem and thus enhance a recognitionaccuracy and time for MWTUs, we fix the wordorder in an MWTU and define the recognitionscope of component words according to theircharacteristics.
Based on it, then we propose arepresentation and recognition method ofMWTUs for a Korean-to-Japanese MT system.In the rest of this paper, details will be presentedabout lhese proposed ideas, logclher with someevalualion results.
For representing Korean andJapanese expressions, the 1994-SK (ROKMinistry of Education) and the KunreiRomanization systems are used respectively.2 Processing of MWTUsIn developing MT systems, we frequentlycontact with some differences in word spacing,grammar, and so on, between sotuve and targetlanguages.
But the method and degree ofdifficulty of handling them highly depend uponthe nature of the source and target hmguage inthe MT system.
In this paper, we treat therepresentation and recognition methods ofMWTUs according to their characteristics foronly a Korean-to-Japanese MT system.2.1 Types of MWTUThere call be 1-1, l-m, n-l, and n-mmapping relations of morphemes between sourceand target language in machine translation.
Dueto the grammatical similarities of Korean andJapanese, Korean-to-Japanese machinetranslation systems have been developed underthe direct MT strategy, which assumes a 1-1mapping relation.
But a uniform application ofthis 1-1 mapping relation will easily result in anunnatural translation.It is not difficult to handle a 1-1 and l-mmapping relations in Korean-to-Japanese MTsystem although it uses only direct MT strategy,because it is easy to recognize only onemorpheme in source language, Korean.
It is alsodue to the fact that Japanese correspondenceshave characteristics of non-spacing andcontinuity, which allows several words to betreated as a single word.
In this reason, we needto consider just types with n-I and n-m mappingrelations.
Table 1 shows the types of MWTUs tobe handled in Korean-to-Japanese MT.The compound words in Table 1 are theunits that must be translated into one Japanesemorpheme though they are conlpound words illKorean.
For example, "wodett peuroseseo" is aKorean compound word which consists of twomorphemes "wodeu" and "l)euroseseo", but itsJapanese equivalent is only one morpheme,"walmro".
The Korean word '),eojju -co bel-dal" is also a compound word, made by 2lexical morphemes "yeoiju" and "be" and 1functional morpheme "-eo", but it alsocorresponds to only one Japanese equivalentmorpheme, "ukagal-u\]".
in these cases, theKorean compound words shoukl be recognizedas one unit to be transformed into one Japanesemorpheme.We can classify verbal nouns into 2 typesaccording to their Japanese quivalents.
Table 2shows them.
If we define a Korean verbal nounas X and its equivalent in Japanese as X', andanother single word in Japanese as Y, we candescribe the two types of relations betweenKorean and Japanese verbal nouns as below.Although the type 1 satisfies l:l mappingrelation, the type 2 does not.
So, for the type2,the verbal noun, X (e.g., "chuka") and "ha\[-da\]"need to be recognized as a single unit to betransformed into a Japanese quivalent, Y.5455) Idiom :: ::~\] l-&,l(congratulation) (do)(noise) (play)(thing) (equal)(bi\[~) (nose) \[,,,~, I(~et hurt)(first) (see)(in favor of)/* ask */iwal-ul/* congratulate */sawa\[-gu\]/* disturb */soul-da\]/,I: seen l  *'/hide -i me -hi a \[-u\]/* have a bitter experience */hazime -masi -te/* How do you do */-110 t(l111(~ -I10/* lbr */ITable 2\] Types of verbal nounsX + ha\[-dalX + hal-dalJapaneseX'  .t- SHl"tlYCollocation patterns are the units thatfrequently co-occurr in sentences and affect thesemantics of each other.
There are two kinds ofcollocation patterns.
In one, each componentmorpheme is translated into different equivalents,such as "dambae \[-reul\] piu\[-&ll(smoke)"corresponding to "tabako -o su\[-u\]", and in theother, all component morphemes must betranslated into one Japanese morpheme with anequivalent meaning, such as "soran \[-eul\]piu\[-da\]" corresponding to "sawa\[-gu\]".
Whilethe morphemes in the former case have a l-to-1mapping relation, the morphemes in the lattercase have an n-to-1 mapping relation andtherefore, must be treated as a single morpheme.While some modalitics consist of only onemorpheme like "-eot" or "-da", there are alsosome modalities made up of several morphemeslike "-neun geot gat".
Accordingly, the lattermust be handled as an MWTU.An Idiom is a general idiomatic unitdefined in a dictionary.
Generally, since anidiom does not reflect literal meaning itself,translating their component morphemesindividually results in very different meaning, Inthis case, it must be treated as a single unit.A colloquial idiomatic phrase is alsocomposed of several morphemes, but it isrecognized like a single unit word.
For instance,the Korean greeting "cheoeum bee 1) -get-seumnida" corresponds to "hazime -masi -le"in Japanese.
In this case, a 1-to-I mappingtransformation results in an unnatural translation.Therefore, it also should be recognized asMWTUs.Moreover, MWTUs can be used for groupsof words that can give a more natural translationwhen they are treated as one unit.
We will callthese groups of words semi-words.2.2 The Characteristics of MWTUsTo minimize the recognition time andrecognition error rate of MWTUs, we need torepresent MWTUs according to theircharacteristics.
The following shows thecharacteristics of MWTUs.1) Fixed word orderAll of the 7 types of MWTUs in Table 1have a fixed word order sequence, even thoughKorean and Japanese are known as free wordorder languages.
Expressions uch as "keu -n kodachi" and "-neun geot gat" nmst be recognized546as MWTUs, but their meaning may be changedfrom thin of MWTUs if the word order sequencehas been changed.
This provides a goodcharacteristic for simply representing MWTUs.2) Extension by insertion o1' other wordsFor some kinds of MWTUs, it is possible toinsert some grammatical morphemes or otherwords between their component n~orplaemes ofan MWTU.
"-do" in (2) , "-reul" and "-reul geu-ege" in (3) are those cases.
(go) (means) (is)/* (l) can go *//* (1) can go, too */.

loosely connected : the relation that somemorphemes can be inserted between them.B-I.
Only particles mad endings of aword are allowed to be inserted betweenthem.B-2.
Any kinds of morphemes can beinserted between them.\[Figure I\] Relations between two adjacentcomponent morphemes of MWTUs3) Strong cohesionAlthough some MWTUs havecharacteristics of extension by insertion of otherwords, component morphemes in an MWTUhave strong cohesion, not only logically but alsophysically.
This means that tile recognition o1' anMWTU is possible by local comparison of itsphysical ocation.
But it does not imply that thescope is limited in a simple sentence structure.4) The predictable recognition scope ofMWTUsIt is possible to predict tile recognitionscope between two adjacent componentmorphemes of MWTUs, according to the abovecharacteristics.
The scope can be predicted asfollows l'or each type of MWTUs shown inTable 1.Component morphemes of a compoundword are corltiguous to the next Olle, so theirscopes are predictable.Both verbal nouns and collocation patternshave the l'orm combined with "Noun" and"Verb", where other words can be insertedbetween them.
But in the case (51'"Noun+Verb+Verb", which is the fern1 thatanother verb is inserted between the noun andverb, its meaning may be different in that of anMWTU.
So ttae scope of the "Verb" can belimited up to the position of the first verbappearing after the "Noun", that is, the positionwhere the POS(part-ofspeech) appears.Component morphemes of a modality havean especially strong cohesion.
So at most, oneparticle is often inserted next to the bound noun.From this, we can predict the next componentmorpheme apart from pro component at most indistance 2.idioms, colloquial idiomatic phrases andsenti-words consist of various colnponenlmorphemes, which results in various scopes forMWTU recognition.
The scopes of eachconlpollellt ll\]Ol'phellles froul pl*e-colllponelltmorphemes can be determined by distance 1,distance 2, or infinity.
But inl'inite scope canalso be limited by the position which the POS ofthe component morpheme appears.2.3 Representation of MWTUThe representation f an MWTU must beconsidered in order to enhance recognitionaccuracy and speed up the process.
Accordingly,in this paper, we propose representation method(51' MWTUs according to the characteristicsmentioned in section 2.2.One basic rule for MWTU representation isthat an MWTU is composed of only lexicalmorphemes if possible, that is, grammatical547morphemes uch as particles and the endings ofa word will be extracted in the representationbecause of the above characteristics which arefreely inserted and omitted.
However,grammatical morphemes affecting the meaningsof MWTUs must be described.Next, according to the characteristicsdescribed in section 2.2, we need to representrecognition scopes between adjacent componentmorphemes and POS of each componentmorpheme for the restriction of recognitionscope.m,(POS,, d,2) m2(POS 2, d2~) ... m,(POS,, d,, m) ...m (POS,,, d,,.,,+,)m~: i-th COlnponent morpheme o1' an MWTUPOS~ : POSofm~d~.~+ x : maximum distance from m, tom~+~\[Figure 2\] Representation of an MWTUd~,~+~ has 4 kinds of values according toFigure 1.
For the case of A, d~,~+, is 1, for the caseof B-l, it is 2, for the case of B-2, it is ~, madthen for the last component morpheme, it isalways 0 because (n+l)-th componentmorpheme doesn't exist.The examples of MWTUs described byabove representation are shown in Figure 3.?

Additionally, forrecognition, we made the first componentmorpheme of the MWTU have an MWTU field,which is composed of MWTUs starting from theentry word.
This means that only one access tothe dictionary is needed after an MWTU isconfirmed.
Figure 4 shows the dictionarystructure for an MWTU.4____;(mouth) (use)/* speak carelessly */\[Connection i fo.

Foran MWTU, "-ji(mC,2) an(V,0), the recognitionscope of "an" is 1 because d3.
2 is 2 and real_dist,, 2is 1, which is from 12-11.
Therefore, we canrecognize MWTUs by a small comparison.548position 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15Korean: , ,e -ga~-eu l  geureoke ~- ,nyeon bi,um-eul bat ~ ~-get-neut,ya ?...

*/\[Figure 6\] Recognition examplesThis Recognition rule can also prohibitsome recognition errors generated fromurlrlecessary comparisons.
For instance, therecognition scope of "ji" in an MWTU"sinse(N,oo),ji(V,0)" was limited by 2, which isthe minimum value between d~=(oo) andreal_distj.2(3-1=2).
So it prohibits errors, such asJapanese (a) in (5), occurring when an MWTU isrecognized in whole sentence.The second rule states that morphemesinserted between the component morphemes ofthe recognized MWTU must be rearranged inthe following manner:1) ff inserted morphemes are lexicalmorphemes, they are rearranged to the front ofthe MWTU.
"geureoke(in that manner)" in (4) issuch a case.2) If they are grammatical morphemes, theyare ignored when they directly follow anycomponent of the MWTU, and they aretransl~rred to the front of the MWTU togetherwith the inserted lexieal morphemes when thcyfollow any inserted lexical morphemes.
In (4),"-eul" is the former case.
If any grammaticalmorpheme such as "-do" or "-ha" is attachedafter "geureoke", it will be the latter case.Third, if a morpheme is the common subsetof the two MWTUs, we select the one such thatits first component morpheme locates in thepre-position.
This rule is used to reduce therecognition time by skipping morphemes whichare subsets of the pre-confirmed MWTUsFourth, we select he superset of MWTU incase that two or more MWTUs starting from asame morpheme are recognized and one is thesuperset of the others.
For" example, let usconsider two MWTUs: '~iamsi -man -yo (wait amoment)" and 'ijamsi -man(for a little while)", ff",jamsi -man-yo" is recognized, '~iamsi -man"can also be recognized and '~amsi -man -yo" isthe supcrset of "jamsi -man".
In this case, weselect he supersct, '~antsi -man -yo".5493 Evaluat ionTo demonstrate the efficiency of ourproposed method, we applied it to aKorean-to-Japanese machine translation system(COBALT-K/J), and evaluated its recognitionaccuracy and recognition time.
COBALT-K/Jconsists of about 150,000 general purpose wordsand 7,500 MWTUs.
For the test corpus, wearbitrary extracted 2,808 sentences from a 10million word corpus, the KIBS (KoreanInformation Base System).
MWTUs registeredin the dictionary appeared 3,647 times in them.Table 3 shows the evaluation resultsclassified by the types of MWTUs.\[Table 3\] Evaluation results on the recognitionof MWTUs~i ,  Accur~u~o,~33 32 97.0%:A)g:No!

Nevertheless,98.4% of the test samples were recognizedcorrectly.
In order to recognize an MWTU, itneeded only 1.03 comparisons per eachcomponent morpheme of the MWTU on theaverage.
This shows the effectiveness and thespeed of our proposed method for treatingMWTUs in Korean-to-Japanese MT.ConclusionIn this paper, we classified the differentkinds o1' MWTUs and proposed a representationand recognition method for them in aKorean-to-Japanese MT.MWTUs in Korean-to-Japanese MT havethe characteristics of fixed word order, strongcohesion, predictable scope of its componentmorphemes, extension by other words, etc.Accordingly, we enhanced accuracy andrecognition time by representing andrecognizing MWTUs according to theircharacteristics.In our experiment, 98.4% of the testsamples were recognized correctly, which showsthe effectiveness of our proposed method.
Infuture work, we will research in more strictrecognition restrictions and plan to extractMWTUs from a corpus automatically.ReferencesD.
