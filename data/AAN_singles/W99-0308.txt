Tagging Psychotherapeutic Interviews for LinguisticAnalysisJon David PATRICKBasser Department of Computer ScienceUniversity of Sydney,Sydney, NSW 2006, Australiajonpat@cs.usyd.edu.auAbstractA proposal is presented to create a tagsetforlinguistic features that constitute the meaning-ful elements o one particular theory of psy-chotherapeutic intervention, that is Grinder &Bandler' s Metamodel.
These features includelexical, lexicogrammatical and semantic phe-nomena.
It is proposed that determining theeffectiveness of therapy could in some degreebe automated by building an information sys-tem to automatically tag client interviews.
Anappraisal of the effectiveness of the computa-tional processing, as well as the therapy, mightbe established by comparing some characteri-sation of client interviews before and aftertherapy based on the features of the Meta-model.
Three 30 minute interviews for each of10 clients are available, that is before andafter group therapy sessions and 3-6 monthslater The prototype tagset is presented forappraisal.
A hand analysis of some of the datagives prima facie justification for persuing thisresearch.The appraisal of the effectiveness of psycho-therapy has proven to be extremely difficult.Both process and outcome studies have pro-vided incomplete evidence as to the effective-ness of therapy (Lambert & Hill, 1994).
Arecent review of the field states that not one outof hundreds of methods has been shown to bemore effective than any other method, thisincludes the failure of psychotropic methods tobe any better than "talk" therapies (Miller,Hubble, Duncan, 1995).
This does not meanthat therapy is not effective as it has been con-vincingly shown to be more effective than pla-cebo and control groups.
However theeffectiveness of therapy has been asserted tobe most highly correlated with four contribu-tory factors; psyhcotherapeutic method 15%,therapeutic relationship 30%, client situation40%, client expectancy 15%(Miller, Hubble,Duncan, 1995).
With this backdrop it can beseen that any method that can contribute tounderstanding and assessing the nature ofchange in a client will benefit not only the psy-chotherapy profession as a whole, but otherprofessions with outcomes that require learn-ing by their clients.There are a great number of psychotherapymethods that dominantly require xtensiveconversational intercourse between therapistand client.
Perhaps the most popularly knownare psychodynamic, Cognitive BehaviouralTherapy(CBT), and interpersonal therapiessuch as family therapy, narrative therapy, emo-tion-focussed therapy, solution-focussed ther-apy.
Many of these therapies have developed ademand for linguistic analysis but with theirstrongest attention on the therapist's rhetoricand discourses.
Their claims about client lan-guage fall more into the level of genre and ide-ology, that is the focus of the therapy is onvaried aspects of the content not the lexico-grammatical structure of the language.
Theonly method that has focussed ominantly onlanguage structure has become known as Neu-rolinguistic Programming.
It was originallyproffered not as a therapy method but as amethod of language analysis, called the Meta-model, suitable for use by practitioners of anytherapeutic method.
However with enhance-ments beyond its linguistic principles, it soon58became promoted as a method of therapy by itssupporters.
In that light Neurolinguistic Pro-gramming has to be viewed as different oother conversational therapies.
It is not alignedwith social constructivist models of realitiesthat represent therapy as challenging andreworking socially constructed phenomena,and which are therefore computationally diffi-cult to evaluate.
Rather it asserts an Intrapsy-chic focus where change is in the mind (andbody) of the client and so has more potentialfor computational processing.The Metamodel method argues that humanshave three principal mechanisms that are nec-essary for filtering information from the exter-nal world.
They are generalization, deletionand distortion, from which people constructtheir model of the world.
In communicatingwith each other, humans project heir model ofthe world, hence any impoverishment in thismodel will be produced in their language.
Inthe circumstances where people are sufferingemotional pain brought about by limitations intheir model, and therefore their sense of nothaving choices of action, a search of their lan-guage structures should show evidence of gen-eralization, distortion and deletion, indicatingthe impoverished components of the model.The process of psychotherapeutic change thenbegins with detecting the impoverishments andthen assisting the client to recognise and thenrecover the missing pieces.
This places the cli-ent in the position of active self-discovery,expanding themselves by actively expandingtheir model of the world (Bandler & Grinder,1975).The Metamodel method is claimed to have thecharacteristics of, firstly, specifying aprocessfor moving from the surface structure of anutterance to its full semantic ontent, secondly,it provides the therapist with an accurate viewof the client's model of the relevant part of theworld, and thirdly, it provides a format forchallenging the full semantic structure of anutterance and reconnecting it with direct per-sonal experience.
These characteristics of theMetamodel mean that the therapist can chal-lenge the client's assumptions that their lin-guistic model is reality, which is a major partof the therapeutic process.The linguistic lasses that are explicitly listedfor use by the Metamodel are the following:Generalization - generalized referential index,non-specific nouns, non-specific verbs, univer-sal quantifiers,Distortion - reversed referential index, nomi-nalisations, ome adverbial constructions(obviously, clearly, surprisingly)Deletion - deleted referential index, non-spe-cific referent, comparatives and superlativeswith missing referents, modal operators ofpossibility and necessity, missing information,presuppositions, semiotic distance (use of pas-sive voice)Semantic ill-formedness - cause & effect,implied causatives, mind reading, lost perfor-matives and complex equivalences.Other linguistic lasses were added with thedevelopment of the idea of RepresentationalSystems, that is, a biased use of sensory spe-cific words of the visual, auditory, kinaesthetic,olfactory and gustatory classes (Grinder &Bandler, 1976)These classes are lexical, lexicogrammaticaland semantic.
We are interested in processingtext to identify and tag each of these phenom-ena.
A set of tagged examples covering theselinguistic lasses is presented in Appendix 1and a prototype tagset is presented in Appen-dix 2.
The proposed tagset at this stageattempts to capture the requirements of theMetamodel at a macro level.
It is accepted thatthis set will be subject o change and refine-ment as a better understanding of both the lin-guistic and computational problems emerge,and in particular the linguistic theory isupdated to include more contemporary knowl-edge.59The Metamodel method has the concept ofstatements hat are "well-formed in therapy"with seven criteria for assessment, whichmight also be used as criteria for characteriz-ing client dialogues.
They are:- well-formed in english- contain no transformational deletions orunexplored eletions of areas of the modelin which the client experiences no choices.- contains no nominalisations- contain no words or phrases lacking referen-tial indices- contain no verbs incompletely specified- contain no unexplored presuppositions in theportion of the model in which the clientexperiences no choice- contain o sentences which violate thesemantic onditions of well-formedness.For the purposes of assessing the value of apsychotherapy rogram, it is conceivable thatthe change in linguistic usage by a client repre-sents the effectiveness of the psychotherapeu-tic process.
If such a postulate is accepted thenthe analysis of the comparison of conversa-tional speech of the client before therapy andafter therapy would be an appropriate measureof therapeutic effectiveness.In our case we have 10 clients with 30 minuteinterviews recorded before therapy, after ther-apy and 3-6 months downstream of therapytotalling 15 hours of transcripts.
We intend todevelop automated processing methods toidentify the linguistic lasses described by theMetamodel, construct a characterisation feach interview and test for a change in lan-guage usage by the clients.
A collation of a fewclasses of representational system data per-formed by hand gave some encouragement thatthis approach is useful.
It showed that 7 out of10 clients had a significant change in their lan-guage towards the desirable direction, that isgreater diversity.
Two showed no change andone showed retrograde change, that is nar-rower diversity.
These results were consistentwith the therapist's observations about theprogress of the clients in their therapeutic pro-gram.R e f e r e n c e sBandler, R. & Grinder, J.
