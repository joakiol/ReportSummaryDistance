THE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MUC-5 RESULT SNancy Chinchor, Ph .D.Science Applications International Corporatio n10260 Campus Point Drive, M/S A2- FSan Diego, CA 9212 1chinchor @gso .saic .com(619) 458-261 4INTRODUCTIONThe statistical significance of the results of the MUC-5 evaluation is determined using a computer-intensiv emethod of hypothesis testing known as approximate randomization .
The exact method is described in detail in 111 an d[2] and has been used as the accepted statistical test for the MUC results since MUC-3 .
The purpose of the statistica ltesting is to determine whether the scores of the systems are different by chance or due to a significant difference i nthe character of the systems .STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE RESULT SStatistical significance results are reported here for the following metrics : Error per Response Fill, F-Mca-sure with recall and precision weighted equally, and Richness-Normalized Error (minimum and maximum) .
The sys-tems are compared for the same domain and language and, thus, there are four figures for each metric : English Join tVentures (EJV), Japanese Joint Ventures (JJV), English Microelectronics (EME), and Japanese Microelectronics(JME) .
The format of the reporting is according to the groupings of the systems which are not significantly differen tfrom each other at the 0.01 level with a confidence of at least 99% .
Systems which are not significantly different fro meach other are underscored on the same line .
The systems are numbered to save space and the correspondence of th enumber and system site are given below the significance results .It is interesting to note that the rankings of systems do not change when using the Error per Response Fil lmetric or the F-Measure.
The numerical rankings change slightly (numbers 6 and 7 in EJV reverse, and numbers 4and 5 in JJV reverse), but those changes are not significant statistically because the two members in each of th ereversed pairs are both in the same significance grouping for both of the two metrics .
It is also interesting to note tha tthe Error per Response Fill metric distinguishes four more systems than the F-Measure over all domains and lan-guages .
The Richness-Normalized Error metric distinguishes far fewer systems statistically than the Error pe rResponse Fill metric with 29 systems distinguished by Richness-Normalized Error as opposed to 55 by Error perResponse Fill for EJV alone .
Both the minimum and maximum Richness-Normalized Error metrics produce the sam erankings and statistical results so are conflated here .
The statistical groupings of systems for Richness-NormalizedError are so large and so numerous that systems cannot be distinguished well enough to reflect their perceived differ-ences in performance .
It is believed that this is due to the fact that the Richness-Normalized Error metric ignores th eamount of spurious data generated by a system and that the amount and kind of spurious data generated impacts th eperception of how well the system is doing in an operational setting .CONCLUSIONSThe approximate randomization method has been used to determine the statistical significance of the rank-ings of systems for MUC-5 .
It is also useful for reflecting on the relative merits of the evaluation metrics .
The statis-tical results show that the Error per Response Fill metric is the most sensitive metric of the three in terms o fdistinguishing systems.
However, no statistically significant changes in ranking occur when F-Measure is used .
TheRichness-Normalized Error metric distinguishes far fewer systems than either of the other metrics .79English Joint Ventures - Error per Response Fill1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 131) GE/CMU2) BBN3) SRI4) UMASS/HU5) PMAX6) USUSSEX7) NMSUIBR8) NYU9) SRA10) PRC11) USC12) MITRE13)TRWI) GE/CMU-OPT2) GFJCMU3) NMSU/BR4) SRA5) SRI6) BBNEnglish Microelectronics - Error per Response Fil l1 2 3 4 5 6 71) GE/CMU2) BBN3) OMAN4) LSI5) NMSU/BR6) UMASS/HU7) UMIC HJapanese Joint Ventures Error .
