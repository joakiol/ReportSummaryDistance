{dtamb@aua.gr}AbstractThis article investigates (a) whether registerdiscrimination can successfully exploit linguisticinformation reflecting the evolution of alanguage (such as the diglossia phenomenon ofthe Modern Greek language) and (b) what kindof linguistic information and which statisticaltechniques may be employed to distinguishamong individual styles within one register.Using clustering techniques and featuresreflecting the diglossia phenomenon, we havesuccessfully discriminated registers in ModemGreek.
However, diglossia information has notbeen shown sufficient to distinguish amongindividual styles within one register.
Instead, alarge number of linguistic features need to bestudied with methods such as discriminantanalysis in order to obtain a high degree ofdiscrimination accuracy.1 IntroductionThe identification of the language stylecharacterising the constituent parts of a corpus isvery important o several appfieations.
Forexample, in information retrieval applications,where large corpora of texts need to be searchedefficiently, it is useful to have information aboutthe language style used in each text, to improvethe accuracy of the search (Karlgren, 1999).
Infact, the criteria regarding language style maydiffer for each search and therefore - due to thelarge number of texts - there is a requirement toperform style categorisation i an automatedmanner.
Such systems normally use statisticalmethods to evaluate the properties of given texts.The complexity of the studied properties varies.Kilgarriff (1996) employs mainly the frequency-of-occurrence of words while Karlgren (1999)applies tatistical methods primarily on structuraland part-of-speech information.Baayen et al (1996), who study the topic ofauthor identification, apply statistical measuresand methods on syntactic rewrite rules resultingby processing a given set of texts.
They reportthat the accuracy thus obtained is higher thanwhen applying the same statistical measures tothe original text.
On the other hand, Biber(1995) uses Multidimensional Analysis coupledwith a large number of linguistic features todistinguish amongregisters.
The underlying ideais that, rather than being distinguished on thebasis of a set of finguistic features, registers aredistinguished on the basis of combinations ofweighted linguistic features, the so-called"dimensions".This article reports on the discrimination oftextsin written Modem Greek.
The ongoing researchdescribed here has followed two distinctdirections.
First, we have tried to distinguishamong registers of written Modern Greek.
In asecond phase, our research has focused ondistinguishing among individual styles withinone register and, more specifically, amongspeakers of the Greek Parliament.
To achievethat, structural, morphological nd part-of-speechinformation is employed.
Initially (in section 2)emphasis is placed on distinguishing among thedifferent registers used.
In section 3, the task ofauthor identification is tested with selectedstatistical methods.
In both sections, we describethe set of linguistic features measured, we arguefor the statistical method employed and wecomment on the results.
Section 4 contains adescription of future plans for extending this fineof research while in section 5 the conclusions ofthis article are provided.2 Distinguishing RegistersTo distinguish among registers, we successfullyexploited a particular feature of Modem Greek,namely the contrast between Katharevousa andDemotiki.
These are variation.,; of Modern Greekwhich correspond (if only roughly) to formal andinformal speaking.
Katharevoma was the officiallanguage of the Greek State until 1979 when itwas replaced by Demotiki.
By that time,Demotiki was the establis\]hed language ofliterature while, in times, it had been thelanguage of elementary education.
Compared toDemotiki, Katharevousa bears an importantresemblance to Ancient Greek manifestedexplicitly on the morphological level and the useof the lexicon.
At a second step, we dropped theKatharevousa-Demotiki approach and relied onpart-of-speech information, which is oftenexploited in text categofisafion experiments (forinstance, see Biber et al 1998).
Again, weobtained satisfactory esults.2.1 Method of workThe variables used to distinguish among registersmay be grouped into the following categories:1.
Morphological variables: These were verbalendings quantifying the contrastKatharevousa / Demofiki.
Although themorphological differences between these twovariations of Greek are not limited to theverb paradigm, we focused on the latter sinceit better highlights the contrast underconsideration (Tainbouratzis et al, 2000).
Atotal of 230 verbal endings were selected,split into 145 Demotiki and 85 Katharevousaendings (see also the Appendix).
These 230frequencies-of-occurrence were grouped into12 variables for use in the, statistical nalysis.2.
Lexical variables: Certain negation particles(ovd~ei?, otu~rere, oo~o4zo6, dryer)clearlysignify a preference for Katharevousa whileothers (~51Xo~?, #are, Xcopi?)
are clearindicators of Demotiki.
However, the mostfrequently used negation particles (tzt,/a/v,~cv) are not characteristic ofeither of the twovariations.3.
Structural macro-features: average sentencelength, number of commas, dashes andbrackets (total of 4 variables).4.
After the completion of the experiments withvariables of type 1-3 (Tambouratzis et al,2000), Part-of-Speech (PoS) counts wereintroduced.
The PoS categories wereadjectives, adjunedons, adverbs, articles,conjunctions, nouns, pronouns, numerals,particles, verbs and a hold-all category (fornon-classifiable ntries), resulting in 11variables expressed as percentages.These variables are more similar to thecharacteristics used by Karlgren (1999), anddiffer considerably from those used by Kilgarriff(1996) and Baayen et al (1996).
For the metricsof the first and thkd categories, a custom-builtprogram was used running under Linux.
Thisprogram calculated all structural andmorphological metrics for each text in a singlepass and the results were processed with the helpof a spreadsheet package.
The metrics of thesecond category were calculated using a custom-built program in the C programming language.PoS counts were obtained using the ILSP tagger(Papageorgiou et al, 2000) coupled with anumber of custom-built programs to determinethe actual frequencies-of-occurrence from thetagged texts.
Finally, the STATGRAPHICSpackage was used for the statistical nalysis.The dataset selected consisted of examples fromthree registers:(i) fiction (364 Kwords - 24 texts),(ii) texts of academic prose referring tohistorical issues, also referred to as thehistory register (361 Kwords - 32 texts) and(iii) political speeches obtained from theproceedings of the Greek parliamentsessions, also referred to as the parliamentregister (509 Kwords - 12 texts).The texts of registers (I) and (II) were retrievedfrom the ILSP corpus (Gavrilidou et al, 1998),all of them dating from the period 1991-1999.The texts of register (III) were transcripts of theGreek Parliament sessions held during the firsthalf of 1999.This dataset was processed using both seededand unseeded clustering techniques with between3 and 6 clusters.
The unseeded approachconfirmed the existence of distinct naturalclasses, which correspond to the three registers.The seeded approach confirmed the ability toaccurately separate these three registers and tocluster their elements together.
Initially, a "short"data vector containing only the 12 morphologicalvariables quantifying the Demofiki/Katharevousacontrast was used (Tambouratzis etal.
2000), aswell as a 16-element vector combining structuraland morphological characteristics.
The seeds forthe Parliaraent and History registers were chosenrandomly.
The seeds for the Fiction register werechosen so that at least one of them would not be36an "outlier" of the Fiction register.Representative results are shown in Table 1 forthe different vectors and numbers of clusters.
Ineach case, the classification rate quotedcorresponds to the number of text elementscorrectly classified (according to the register ofthe respective seed).12-elem.

A new set of clustering experiments wereperformed using Ward's method with thesquared Euclidean distance measure to clusterthe data in an unseeded manner.
Finally, a 15-element data vector was used with PoS andstructural information but without anymorphological information.
The results obtained(Table 2) show that PoS information improvesthe clustering performance.2.2 Comments on the ResultsOur results strongly suggest hat registers ofwritten Modem Greek can be discriminatedaccurately on the basis of the contrastKatharevousa / Demotiki manifested withmorphological variation.
Languages with adifferent history may not be suited to such acategorisafion method.
This is evident in Biber'swork (1995) for the English language, where avariety of grammatical and macro-structurallinguistic features but no morphological variationfeatures were employed.
It seems then thatcorpora of languages which are characterised bythe phenomenon of diglossia, may besuccessfully categorisable on the basis ofmorphological information (or other reflexes ofdiglossia).
Such a discrimination method maygive results as satisfactory as approaches whichare closer to the Biber (1995) spirit and rely onPoS and structural measures (see Tables 1 and2).Tables 1 and 2 show that the accuracy ofclustering reaches approximately 99% while theseeded clustering approach ad a high degree ofaccuracy, reaching 100% when using 5 clusters.For the 27-element vector with bothmorphological and PoS information, perfectclustering has been achieved even with 4clusters.
On the other hand, a successfulclustering (albeit with a lower level of accuracy)is achieved using only structural and PoSinformation.It should be noted that the lexical variables used,that is the negation particles, did not contribute atall (Markantonatou et al, 2000).
Furthermore,the system performed almost as well with andwithout macro-structure features, the differencein accuracy being less than 5%.The parliament texts can be claimed to form aregister whose patterns are closely positioned inthe pattern space.
Of the three registers, theliterature one presented the highest degree ofvariance, with more than one sub-clustersexisting as well as outlier elements.
This may beexplained by the fact that the parliamentproceedings, contrary to literature, undergointensive diting by a small group of specialisedpublic servants.3 Distinguishing Styles within OneRegisterIn this section, we report on our efforts todistinguish among individual styles within oneregister.
In particular, we intend to distinguishamong speakers of the Parliament by studyingthe transcripts of the speeches of five parliamentmembers over the period 1997-2000.
Each ofthese speakers belongs to one of the five politicalparties that were represented in the Greekparliament over that period.
Up to date, theexperiments have been limited to the period1999-2000.3.1 Method of workThe number of variables (46 in total) calculatedfor each of the five speakers can be grouped asfollows:.

The identity of the speaker, denoted as thespeaker Signature (1 variable), which wasused to determine the desired classification.Similarly to the clustering experiments, a set ofC programs was used to extract automatically thevalues of the aforementioned variables from thetranscripts.
Most of these programs rely onmeasuring the occurrence of di-gram% and moregenerally n-grams, for letters, words and tagsets,thus being straight-forward.
In the case ofspeaker identification, Discriminant Analysiswas used, as the clustering approach did not givevery good results, indicating that the distinctionamong personal styles is weaker than that amongregisters.
Even when only 2 speakers were used,the clusters formed involved patterns from bothspeaker classes.We experimented with two corpora, Corpus I andCorpus 11, as described in Table 3.
Corpus H is asubset of Corpus I.
Each of the speechesincluded in Corpus II was delivered as anopening speech Cprotoloyia") at a parliamentsession when at least wo of the studied speakersdelivered speeches.An important issue is whether the selectedvariables are strongly correlated.
If indeed strongcorrelations do exist, these might be used toreduce the dimensionality of the pattern space.For the purposes of this analysis, the 46independent variables were used (45 in the caseof Corpus II where only "protoioyiai" exist, sincethen the order variable is constantly equal to 1).The number of correlations of all variable pairsexceeding iven thresholds i depicted in Figure1, for both Corpus I and Corpus 11.
Accordingto this study, in Corpus IL the percentage ofvariable pairs with an absolute value ofcorrelation exceeding 0.5 is approximately 3%,indicating a low correlation between theparameters.
Additionally, out of 990 pairs ofCorpus 11, only a single one has a correlationexceeding 0.8.
The correlations for the sameparameter pairs over the two corpora re similar,though as a rule the correlation for Corpus I isless that that for Corpus 11, reflecting the largervariability of texts in Corpus I.
The correlationstudy indicated that most of the parameters arenot strongly correlated.
Thus, a factor analysisstep is not necessary and the application of thediseriminant analysis directly on the originalvariables i  justified.Initially, Corpus I (see Table 3) was processed.The 46 aforementioned variables were used togenerate discriminant functions accuratelyrecognising the identity of the speaker.
To thatend, three different approaches were used:(i) the full model: all variables were used todetermine the discriminant functions;38(ii) the forward model: starting from anempty model, variables were introduced inorder to create a reduced model, with asmall number of variables;(iii) the backward model: starting from the fullmodel, variables were eliminated to createa reduced model.In the cases of the forward and backwardmodels, the values of the F parameter to bothenter and delete a variable were set to 4 while themaximum number of steps to generate the modelwas set to 50.Year 1999-2000Speaker Corpus I Corpus IIA 92 30B 45 24C 33 21D 21 16E 150 36Table 3 - Comparative composition ofCorpus I and Corpus 11.The performance ofthis model is improved if:I. the order in which each particular speechwas delivered is taken into account: thesubset of "protoloyiai" is well-defined andpresents a low variance while the speeches ofsecond or lower order have a highervariance.2.
the corpus comprises only sessions wheremore than one speaker has deliveredspeeches.
Thus, the more balanced Corpus II(Table 3) presents an improveddiscrimination performance.For these two corpora, the results of thediseriminant analysis are shown in Table 4.
Thediscrimination rate obtained with Corpus II ismuch higher than that for Corpus I.
In addition,smaller models, with 8 variables, may be createdthat correctly classify at least 75% of Corpus II.An example of the factors generated and themanner in which they separate the pattern spaceis shown in the diagrams of Figure 2.3.2 Comments  on the ResultsThough this research is continuing, certain factscan be reported with confidence.Within the Greek Parliament Proceedingsregister, individual styles can not be classified onthe basis of morphological features expressingthe contrast Katharevousa/Demotiki.
This maybe explained by the fact that these texts undergointensive diting towards a well-established sub-language.
This editing homogenises themorphological profile of the texts but, of course,does not go as far as homogenising the lexicalpreferences of the various speakers.
That is why,contrary to the register-clustering experiments,lexical variables expressing the particularcontrast seem to play a role in discriminatingbetween speakers and why the use ofKatharevousa-odented n gative particles, whichwas not important in register discrimination,seems to be of some importance in stylediscrimination.
The observation that negativewords play a role in style identification is inagreement with the observations ofLabb6 (1983)on the French political speech.Structural features have turned out to beimportant: the average word length, the use ofpunctuation and question marks and the use ofcertain parts-of-speech such as articles,conjunctions, adjuncfions and - especiaUy -verbs.
Furthermore, the distribution of verbs intopersons and numbers seems to be important,though the exact variables selected differdepending on the exact set of speeches used(these variables are of course complementary).One of the most interesting findings of thisresearch is that it is important whether thespeaker delivers a "protoloyia" or not.
"Protoloyiai" can be classified at a rate of 95%while mixed deliveries result in a lower rate, aslow as 75%.
This may be caused by two factors:1.
"Protoloyiai" represent longer stretches oftext, which are more characteristic ofa givenspeaker.2.
Speakers prepare meticulously for their"protoloyiai" while their other deliveriesrepresent a more spontaneous type of speech,which tends to contain patterns hared by allthe parliament members.Finally, certain additional patterns are emergingfor each of the speakers.
Certain speakers (e.g.speaker A) are more consistently recognised thanothers (e.g.
speaker B) while speaker B is similarto speaker C and speaker D is similar to speakerE.
This indicates that additional variables may berequired to improve the classification accuracyfor all speakers.correlation of variablesm mo ~ ' ~ _ - - _ ~ _  : : :=0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8-10correlation level?

We also plan tosubstitute average lengths (of both words andsentences) with the distribution of lengths.Furthermore, we intend to introduce certainstructural measurements such as repetition ofstructures, chains of nominals and the occurrenceof negation within NP phrasal eousdments.Another possible extension involves theinclusion of the speech topic.
As certainspeakers' characteristics seem to change throughtime, we plan to process the entire corpus ofspeeches for the target period 1997/-2000.Finally, an important issue is the comparison ofthe results obtained in our experiments o thesegeneratedby alternative t chniques proposed byother researchers.
This will allow the deductionof more accurate conclusions regarding thestrengths and the weaknesses of the researchstrategies.In this article, ongoing research on register andindividual style eategorisation f written ModemGreek has been reported.
A system has beenproposed for the automatic registercategorisafion of corpora in Modem Greekexploiting the highly inflectional nature of thelanguage.
The results have been obtained with arelatively constrained set of registers; howevertheir recognition accuracy is remarkably high,exceeding 98% with an unseeded clusteringapproach using between 3and 6 clusters.On the front of individual style categorisation, adiscrimination rate of over 80% was achieved forfive speakers within the Greek Parliamentregister.
Morphological variables were shown tobe of less importance to this task, while lexiealand straetural variables eemed to take over.
Weare planning to introduce several new lexical andstructural variables in order to achieve betterdiscrimination rates and to determinediscriminating features of the different styles.40AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to thank the Dept.
