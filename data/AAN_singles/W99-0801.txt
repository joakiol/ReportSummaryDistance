Keynote Talk:Diamonds on my Windshield:the Use of Computer-based Instructionin Computat ional  LinguisticsJ o  Ca lder  (Un ivers i ty  o f  Ed inburgh)Abst rac tMany disciplines currently have more orless organized activities concerned withdeveloping resources to support Internet-and computer-based instruction.
Thistalk will examine this area, with partic-ular focus on the questions:?
What is special about computa-tional linguistics in terms of its sub-ject matter, history and existing re-sonrces??
What is the current state of re-sources in our area??
Wheal is this kind of instruction jus-tified??
What are the problems to be facedaald what solutions might there be?We will see that in some cases computer-based intervention can lead to enhancedlearning, and so provide a non-economicjustification for the use of such tech-niques.
AJso, current technological de-velopments offer part of the answer tothe problem that such resources are of_teal not reused.
