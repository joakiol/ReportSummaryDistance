Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Computational Semantics, page 1,Tilburg, January 2009. c?2009 International Conference on Computational SemanticsInvited TalkIt?s time for a semantic engineIdo DaganDepartment of Computer ScienceBar Ilan UniversityRamat Gan, Israeldagan@cs.biu.ac.ilAbstractA common computational goal is to encapsulate the modeling of a targetphenomenon within a unified and comprehensive ?engine?, which addressesa broad range of the required processing tasks.
This goal is followed incommon modeling of the morphological and syntactic levels of natural lan-guage, where most processing tasks are encapsulated within morphologicalanalyzers and syntactic parsers.
In this talk I suggest that computationalmodeling of the semantic level should also focus on encapsulating the var-ious processing tasks within a unified module (engine).
The input/outputspecification of such engine (API) can be based on the textual entailmentparadigm, which will be described in brief and suggested as an attractiveframework for applied semantic inference.
The talk will illustrate an initialproposal for the engine?s API, designed to be embedded within the promi-nent language processing applications.
Finally, I will sketch the entailmentformalism and efficient inference algorithm developed at Bar-Ilan University,which illustrates a principled transformational (rather than interpretational)approach towards developing a comprehensive semantic engine.1
