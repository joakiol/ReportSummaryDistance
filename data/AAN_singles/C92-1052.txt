Temporal Structure of Discourse*Irene Pimenta RodriguesJosd Gabriel P. LopesCentro de Intelig6ncia Artificial, UNINOVAQuints da Torte, 2825 Monte da Caparica Portugalemail:(ipr,gpl)@fct.unl.ptAbstractIn this paper discourse segments are defined and amethod for discourse segmentation primarily basedon abduction of temporal relations between seg-ments is proposed.
This method is precise and com-putationally feasible and is supported by previouswork in the area of temporal anaphora resolution.1 In t roddct ionB.
Webber in \[22\] explains how discourse seg-mentation contributes to the interpretation oftense.
In this paper we discuss how "tense in-terpretation" contributes to discourse segmen-tation.
Following Webber's operational defini-tion of segments \[21\] we present he data strucotures necessary for representing discourse seg-ments and an algorithm to perform discoursesegmentation.In order to build a discourse segment struc-ture some clear criteria for grouping chunks oftext into segments and for grouping these seg-ments into other segments must be available.Our criteriou is based on the maintenance oftemporal coherence between segments.
It relieson the abduction of temporal relations betweensegments that necessarily have temporal prop-erties.Abduction of temporal relations between seg-ments is a feasible and precise method for dis-course segmentation.
This is the leading cri-terion for segmentation and does not preventus from using other criteria such as clue words,spatial relations and recognition of state elabo-ration.
Current discourse structure theories usecriteria such as rhetorical relations \[9, 15, 13\], in-tention recognition \[7\], narrative discontinuities\[18\], etc.
All of them use a temporal criterionfor segmentation embedded ill less manageable*This work has been supported by JNICT, INIC andGabinet?

Temporal anaphora - the interpretation oftense and aspect depends on the discourse struc-ture \[22\].
The maintenance of a "Temporal Fo-cus" is suggested by some authors \[11, 22, 18, 5\]for tense interpretation.
Based on their workour main concern is to provide the "temporalfocus" for tense interpretation.
In our segmentstructure the temporal focus is the set of visiblesegments.
A pop in the temporal focus structurewill imply the closing of one or more segments.?
This and that anaphora - These pronounsmay refer to discourse segments \[21\].
With oursegmentation we provide discourse segments forreference.?
Pronominal and definite anaphora - the in-terpretation of pronouns and definite nominalsdepends on the attentional structure (Grosz andSidner).
The attentional structure depends onthe discourse segmentation.
With our approachto segmentation the attentional structure can becomputed from our discourse structure - -  ourvisible segments provide visible entities and se-quents for these anaphors.?
event reference - our approach provides arepresentation for eventualities, the discoursereferents and tile attentional structure necessaryfor solving this kind of anaphora,?
temporal coherence - is achieved by in-ferring one of the possible temporal relationsbetween two eventualities \[14\].
Our segmen-tation process mainly controlled by abductionof temporal relations between eventualities n-ables us to check if a text is temporally coherent.Moreover as we propagate temporal constraintsthrough discourse structure the number of even-I I)efinition of the rhetorical relation motivation \[15\].ACTES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 hO'dT 1992 3 3 1 PROC.

23-28, 1992tualities that must be temporally related with anew eventuality increases.
* temporal reliability - is achieved by the ex-istence of a model for the temporal relations in-ferred.
During discourse processing we build atemporal structure where all the temporal con-stralnts can be checked.
This structure is up-dated when a new temporal referent or a newlyabducted temporal relation is added.
Thus tem-poral reliability is granted.?
discourse coherence - is difficult to check byusing only our discourse structure.
It requiresmore processing, namely the ability to find in-tentions for the segments.Tense interpretation contributes to segmenta-tion by defining the temporal relation betweenthe segment used as reference and the segmentthat represents the tensed sentence to be in-terpreted.
Thus tense interpretation allows thechoice of a segment by indicating where to at-tach the new sentence segment and greatly re-stricts the possible referents for anaphora res-olution.
A failure in satisfying structural con-straints results in the choice of another segmentreferent.The temporal anchoring of eventualities as-sumes that there is some temporal represen-tation for the eventualities.
In this paper weuse a representation for eventualities close tothe event calculus\[12\], and a graph structurefor time representation.
Updating the discoursestructure will be equivalent to updating a tem-poral data base.
Discourse referents are exis-tentially quantified variables that can be furtherconstrained by the analysis of a new discoursesentence.In the following sections the temporal rela-tions used in this paper are defined, followed byan explanation of our notion of segments, theirproperties and the algorithm for discourse seg-mentation.
A detailed example will be workedout.
Finally a conclusion and a comparison ofour work with related work in this area is pre-sented.2 Tempora l  re la t ionsThe semantic representation of an eventualityincludes a time interval where the eventualitymust be true so that the sentence and the dis-course can be true.
The time interval will berepresented by two time points.
Temporal re-lations between two time intervals can be ex-pressed by relations between the extremes of thetime intervals.
So instead of using the 13 rein-tions proposed by Allen \[1\] we have chosen touse just 5 relations.?
t,, < t,  2 = t,~s < t,~, - this relation is likeAllen's relation before or meets.?
t , ,  > t,~ --=- ts2s < i,,~ - this relation is likeAllen's relation after or met-by.?
t,, C t.~ = t.~, < t , , , , t , ,s  < t,~s - thisrelation is like Allen's relation IN.?
to~ D t,3 =-- t?~+ < t,~,,t,~ < ts~s - thisrelation is like Allen's relation ON.?
t?~ c~ t,= = 3t : t C t , , ,  t C t,2 - this relationis like Allen's relation !.These 5 relations are enough for translatingnatural language sentences as it is difficult toexpress the 13 relations of Allen and their 213combinations in natural language.
F. van Eynde\[6\] presents the set of relations necessary forthe temporal systems he studied (for EEC lan-guages).
Our relation set, however, is smal ler .As sentence aspect coerces the verb aspectualclass to change \[16\], v. Eynde's overlap relationsmay be rewritten using the relations < and >.The following examples will demonstrate ouruse of the temporal relations.
For the sake ofsimplicity only discourse referents introduced byeventualities and time intervals are represented.Eventualities introduced by nominals (as in ex-ample I "his key") are discarded.I) John picked off his key(l).
He opened thedoor(2).The eventualities of sentences (1)and (2) are:event(st, pick(john, key1}}, time(eht,~);event(e2, open(john, door1)), time(e2,t?2);the temporal relation is t,, < t+ 2.lI) John bought an umbrella(l).

Itis represented by a discourse referent hat canbe used for later reference.
In contrast o otherdiscourse theories, segments ms dynamic struc-tures that help to define context interpretationsare considered as real discourse objects.
Thus inour approach we use segments as objects withproperties that will be defined later.
A text isrepresented by a segment and a segment suppliescontext information for the semantic interpreta-tion during discourse processing.Next segments will be defined as well as theirconstruction and use in the semantic interpreta-tion.3.1 K ind  of segmentsWe distinguish two kinds of segments: basic andnon-basic ones.A basic segment represents an eventuality plussome features, typically syntactic ones like tenseand aspect (tile leaves of fig.
1).A nonbasic segment has one or more subseg-ments (basic or not) obeying to a set of temporalconstraints and a set of features.
Every nonbasicsegment has a sort depending on the temporalconstraints it imposes on its subsegments.Segment features are necessary for discoursereasoning.
Some of them may be dropped aftera closing but others have to remain until the dis-course is completely processed.
The features wetake into account in this paper are the following:?
tense - The feature tense is needed for tem-poral anaphora resolution.?
eventuality - The semantic representationof an eventuality is important for temporalanaphora resolution, for causal reasoning andother kinds of reasoning that depend on the kindof the eventuality.?
eventuality time - This is the main issueill the definition of a segment as the abductedrelation between eventuality times determinestile segment structure's behavior.?
discourse referents - for solving discoursereference.?
subsegments - an ordered list containing allits subsegments.3.2 Sorts of  segmentsDepending on the abducted temporal relationbetween eventualities in a discourse, the even-tualities are grouped into different sorts of seg-ments.
Using the above mentioned five tempo-ral relations even sorts of segments ~ can he de~fined, e.g.1.
basic - the minimal segment.2.
none - this segment does not impose anyrestriction on tile temporal relation of its sub-segments.
The discourse of example VI will berepresented by this sort of segment.3.
sequence -- the subsegments in the list ofsegments are temporally ordered, e.g.
ex I (fig.l.a).4. fb - contains only two subsegments with thefirst one temporally situated after the secondone, e.g.
ex H (fig.
1.b).5. bk - has two subsegments with the first onetemporally contained in tire second one, e.g.exIII.6.
elab - has two subsegments with the firstone temporally containing the second one, e.g.ex IV.7.
over - every segment in the list of subseg-ments must temporally intersect a nonemptytime interval, e.g.
ex V.For each sort of segment it must be definedhow to compute its features representing prop-erties from the features of its aubsegments.3.3 P roper t ies  of  SegmentsSegments that can have a list of subsegmentscontaining an unlimited number of segments arenone, sequence sad over.
These segments canbe augmented during discourse processing.

These segments can only heaugmented by the replacement of its second sub-segment by a new one obeying the same set ofconstraints.
The replaced segment is the firstsubsegment of the new one.
These segmentshave the same features of the first subsegment(fig.
1.b for a segment of sort fb).3.4 D iscourse  Segmentat ionDiscourse segmentation will be done incremen-tally.
A sentence will be represented by a seg-ment.
The processed iscourse will be repre-sented by a segment.3A notion similar to the sequence s gntent is used inother theorl?~ for discourse segmentation named in RST\[15\] u "narration", in Hobba \[9\] also As "narration" andin planning \[10\] as U~quence'.The steps for the discourse segmentation are:1. to obtain the first sentence segment.
Thissegment will be the discourse segment.2.
to obtain the segment representing the nextdiscourse sentence.3.
to insert the new segment in the discoursesegment.
This step will have the following sub-steps:(a) To compute the set of visible segments (i.e.the right subsegments of the discourse segment)from the discourse segment.
This set of seg-ments can be ordered by some discourse pref-erence rule, e.g.
we may prefer to continue thecurrent segment or prefer to continue the firstopened segment and close the other ones 4.
(b) to choose one segment sl from the set ofvisible segments.
(c) to add the new sentence segment s2 to seg-ment s I by:?
continuing the subsegment list of Sl if s2can satisfy the constraints of sl.?
substituting sj by a new one as.
sz con-tains s I as first subsegment and s2 as secondsubsegment in its subsegnlent list.
The sort ofsegment s3 is one of the 6 nonbasic ones.
(d) if it is not possible to add the new segmentthen choose another segment from the set of thevisible ones, call it sl and try again going backto step 3c.4.
go back to step 2 if there are more sentencesto process in the discourse.3.5 Abduct ion  o f  tempora l  re la t ionsThe main process in discourse segmentation is tocheck for temporal relations between segmentsbecause this is the only criterion used for seg-mentation.For deciding how to link segment s2 given seg-ment sl,  do:1. find the referent for s2.?
if sl is going to be continued by s2, thenthe referent will be the last subsegment in thesubsegment list of segment Sl.?
if sl is going to be substituted by a newsegment sa then the referent will be Sl.4The way segments are ordered will have conse-quenc~ on the discourse segmentation.
In caAes wherethere are more then one possible segmentation preferencewil l  be given to the first one.ACTF.S DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 ^OfYr 1992 3 3 4 PROC.

After obtaining a referent, abduct the tem-poral relation between s2 and the referent.3.
After getting the relation between s2 andthe referent, do:* if sl is to be continued by s2 then cheekif s2 satisfies the set of constraints of st.
If so,update the st features if needed and repeat heprocedure (update features in the parent nodeand check constraints) until the root segment ora node segment whose features don't need to beupdated is reached.
If this process terminatessuccessfully then s2 can continue st.?
if s2 is to be replaced by a new segmentsa then compute the features of segment sa andcheck if the set of temporal constraints of theold parent of segment sl is satisfied.
If so, up-date the old parent st features if needed and re-peat the procedure (update features in the par-ent node and check constraints) until the rootor a node segment whose features don't need tobe updated is reached.
If this process ends sue-ceasfully then sa can replace st.Whenever a temporal entity in the form ofa discourse referent is added to the discoursestructure, the structure containing all temporaldiscourse referents as well as their temporal con-straints hould be updated (fig.
4 for ex.
of see.4).
This way we can distinguish relations thatare implied by the temporal system from thoseinferred using other knowledge sources, e.g.
theconstraints l < t2, ta < t2 do not imply tl < ta,but satisfy it.In order to check for temporal constraints wedo not only deal with constraints over tempo-ral intervals but use also world knowledge forabducting relations between eventualities thatimply some temporal relation between them.
Inorder to abduct a temporal relation it is notenough to block inconsistencies in the tempo-ral system.
There should also be some kind ofjustification, like:* temporal - if the temporal system impliesrelation t0,@t,~ there is a justification to abducttot@t,~, with @ being a temporal relation.?
causal - if et can cause e2 then there is ajustification to abduct ~ < t~.?
contingent - Assuming an event ontologylike that of Moens and Steedman \[17\] whereeventualities have a tripartite structure with apreparatory phase, a culmination and a conse-quence state there are clauses tating what arethe eventualities of the preparatory phase andthose of the consequence state of an eventuality.- if el can be in the preparatory phase of e2there is a justification to abduct ~ C re2.- if el can be in the consequence state of e2there is a justification to abduct te t  > re2.?
particular shared knowledge about eventu-alities - having a temporal knowledge base con-cerning eventualities, general rules for eventual-tries can be stated, e.g.
John usually drinks acup of coffee before he catches the bus.- if e2 usually happens ~ et with ~ being atemporal relation, then there exists justificationto assume te,t~tea.?
Linguistic- verb tense and aspectual per-spective (AP) are the linguistic features ~ thatcontribute to the temporal anchorage ofeventu-alities.
There are rules that justify a temporalrelation taking into account hese features andthe order of the sentences.
They should be usedas default rules, i.e.
if it can not be found an-otber justification for a temporal anchoring thena linguistic justification should be used.
The fol-lowing rules are used in the detailed example.if tense of el and of e2 is simple past (SP)with perfective AP tben there is justification forassuming t~ < re2.- if tense of el is SP with perfective AP andtense of e2 is SP with imperfeetive AP thereexists justification to assume tea C it2.If a justification for the abduction of a par-ticular temporal relation is not a logical conse-quence of the knowledge base then the justifi-cation sbould be added to the set of conditions.e.g.
if we abduct in the discourse "John fell fromthe balcony.
Mary pushed hzm."
that John fellbecause Mary had pushed him, we should add theclause "eause(et, e2)" in order to block the fu-ture inference tbat Mary was innocent in John'sfall.
In this example another interpretation, lin-guistically justified, could be t~l~t I < t~pu,h s.4 Deta i led  ExampleConsider the following discourse represented bythe segment in fig.

The only way toincorporate the sentence s2's segment is by re-placing the current discourse structure by a newone (basic segments cannot be continued).
Sl isthe reference to anchor s2, the eventuality of s~is a state, so the relation t~t C t,~ is abductedand the new segment is of sort bk (fig.
2.b).To insert Sa there are two visible segments: s2and bk.
Segment bk is the reference for sa be-cause the eventuality of segment s2 is a statewith an imperfective aspectnal perspective andthere is no general knowledge about the even-tualities of s2 and sa allowing us to abduct atemporal relation between them.
The featuresof the bk segment are the same as those of sl, sothe abducted relation between those segmentsis t,~ < G~, so that the discourse structure isreplaced by a new segment of sort sequence (fig.2.c).
To insert segment s4 there are two visiblesegments, namely s3 and sequence.
Using sa asreference, no temporal relation can be abducted.Thus none is abducted using some general rulesaying "eventualities to give and ~o offer are ofto backtrack to that choice point.IMt nlt~th yeetorday nowFigure 4: Temporal anchor ofex.

So the segment s3 is replaced bya new segment of sort none (fig.
2.d) after thecheck to see if it is possible to abduct the re-lation t,b k < t, ,  in order to satisfy the con-straints of the sequence segment.
The time ofsegment s5 is partially anchored in the time in-terval "yesterday" but it still must be anchoredto a reference.
Visible segments are s4, noneand sequence.
Considering that the abductedrelation between s4 and s5 is t,4 < ~,~ and be-tween s3 and s~ is t,a <: t,  8 it is not possible touse s4 as referent because the constraints of seg-ment none were not satisfied.
So the sequencesegment is the only one left and it can be contin-ued by s5 (fig.
2.e) because its constraints aresatisfied, thus te~ < tss,t,.
< t. s are abducted.In order to insert s6, the visible segments are ssand sequence.
Using s5 as referent, the relationt , ,  C 6 ,  is abducted because stop breathing isin the preparatory phase of dying.
Segment s5is replaced by a new segment of sort elab (fig.2.f).
In order to insert segment sT, segment s6 isreplaced by a new sequence segment because therelation t,~ < t, 7 is abducted (becoming blue isin the consequence state of stop breathing) andt, T C t,~ is abducted (becoming blue is in thepreparatory ph~e of dying) (fig.

The in-sertion of ss leads to the final structure (fig.

It uses a criterion whose precisionand feasibility is supported by previous workin the area of temporal  anaphora resolution\[19, 22, 18, 16, 4\].
Our discourse, segmentationprovides the information ecessary for tense in-terpretation (as required in \[22\]), and for con-straining further segmentation.
Although Web~her's temporal  focus structure depends on thelinguistic discourse structure \[7\], she doesn't ex-plain how tense interpretation contributes to thefurther development of tile linguistic structure.Other work tackling the interpretation of tenseand aspect \[19, 18, 13, 4, 2, 16, 3\] does not intendto build up a discourse structure in the Groszand Sidner's \[7\] sense.
In \[13\] rbetorical rela-tions between some eventualities are build up,not discourse segments.
Work in discourse seg-mentat ion based on plan recognition \[20\] doesnot provide the necessary information for tenseinterpretation either.
Our structure intends toprovide the context necessary for the interpre-tation of different kinds of anaphora.
Our ap-proach enables us to compute both, the tempo-ral relations explicitly expressed in the discourseand those implied by the temporal structureof the discourse.
The temporal  coherence canbe evaluated by looking at the final discoursestructure, e.g.
if a discourse is represented bya segment of sort none, no temporal relationsbetween the eventualities described can be ob-tained and thus the discourse is not temporal lycoherent.
Our approach does not prevent usfrom using complementary criteria for thc fur-ther segmentation of discourse, namely from us-ing other criteria such as clue words, spatial re-lations, and recognition of state elaboration.References\[1\] James Allen.
