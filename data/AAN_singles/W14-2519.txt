It is also a powerful political tool,as evidenced through experiments and single-issue studies beyond the lab.
Yet compared to itssignificance, we know very little about framing as a generalizable phenomenon.
Do framingdynamics, such as the evolution of one frame into another, play out the same way for all issues?Under what conditions does framing influence public opinion and policy?
Understanding thegeneral patterns of framing dynamics and effects is thus hugely important.
It is also a seriouschallenge, thanks to the volume of text data, the dynamic nature of language, and variance in ap-plicable frames across issues (e.g., the ?innocence?
frame of the death penalty debate is irrelevantfor discussing smoking bans).
To address this challenge, I describe a collaborative project withJustin Gross, Philip Resnik, and Noah Smith.
We advance a unified policy frames codebook, inwhich issue-specific frames (e.g., innocence) are nested within high-level categories of frames(e.g., fairness) that cross cut issues.
Through manual annotation bolstered by supervised learn-ing, we can track the relative use of different frame cues within a given issue over time and in anapples-to-apples way across issues.
Preliminary findings suggest our work may help unlock theblack box of framing, pointing to generalizable conditions under which we should expect to seedifferent types of framing dynamics and framing effects.71
