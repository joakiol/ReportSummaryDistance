THE RATE OF  PROGRESSIN  NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING 1Norman K. SondheimerUSC/Information Sciences InstituteMarina del Rey, CA 90292With all due respect, the rate of progress in natural laffguage processing has been disappointing to many,including myself.
It is not just that the popular press has had overblown expectations, but that we atthis meeting have.
The consequences of these errors could be severe.
Hopefully, this short note will givean accurate valuation of our rate of progress, identify what some of the problems have been, and presentsome reasonable suggestions on what can be done to improve the situation.WHERE ARE WE?The most obvious evidence of slow progress is found at the end of the chain from research throughdevelopment to application.
Practical natural language interfaces, writing aids, and machine translationsystems all exist.
But the public has not been quick to accept what we can produce.
I know of nocompany that has "gotten rich" off natural language interfaces.
More importantly, in my estimation themost technically successful natural language interface to database systems was introduced in the late1970's.
Although the research community has been quick to point out shortcomings with that system andother systems have been introduced, no clear rival has appeared.
Commercial MT efforts follow the samepattern.Moving backwards along the chain, serious large-scale prototypes of the next generation of systems arehard to find.
This is not due to lack of industrial interest.
All major computer manufacturers seem tohave been interested in natural language processing in recent years.
Those systems which I have heardabout generally appear to be severely limited and habitually delayed.
The next serious competitor toexisting commercial products is not obvious to me.More common are the initial laboratory demonstrations of new understanders and generators, as well astheir components.
Finally, at the beginning of the chain, are the ideas for new systems that come fromnew frameworks, new perspectives on the problem, and new insights from related disciplines.
These arethe stuff of our conferences and journals.
Here may be found the possibility of real progress at a goodpace.Yet, even though the years since the first TINLAP have seen a steady stream of new ideas, I find noIThis work is supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Contract No MDA903 81 C 0335 and by theAir Office or Scientific Research under FQ8671-84-01007.
Views and conclusions contained in this report are the author's and shouldnot be interpreted as representing the official opinion or policy of DARPA, AFOSR, the U.S. Government, orany person or agencyconnected with them.I am delighted to thank my colleagues: Ralph Weischedel, Ray Perrault, Tom Galloway, Ron Ohlander, Ed Hovy, Bob Neches,Larry Miller, Bob Kasper, Mitch Marcus, Larry Birnbaum and Bill Mann, for taking the time to set me straight.116special reason to believe that these will be better able to scale up and still solve the difficult problemsthat have always faced us.
These problems include lexical ambiguity, ill-formed input, metonomy, andeven the fundamental problem presented by the size of a realistic knowledge base.
Without greater proofof the ideas usefulness, they serve at best as better insights into the problems natural language presents tous.
Although these may be useful to us and others who study language, they cannot be accepted as endsin themselves for a field that is defined in terms of machine processing.. , .If my analyses are correct, it is unreasonable to expect he broad base of support we have thus far beenprovided to continue.WHAT IS WRONG HERE?I can only guess where the problems lie and I can only do that from my personal perspective.
You canassume that I have seen every one of these mistakes in my own behavior.A fundamental problem is that I and, probably, most researchers are not truly realistic about thedifficulty of the problem.
Most of us do try hard to understand our situation, promise only what wethink we can deliver, and do our best to develop appropriate public expectations.
Even so, the problem isthat we probably still underestimate he difficulties.
It is likely that there is still much more to naturallanguage than  we now realize.
How can we really say what we need to allow for to achieve truly humanlevel performance?
The mere fact that we take the problem to be formalizing one of the most complexhuman abilities may well make complete success impossible.It is also likely that we can't hope to unambiguously identify progress.
We can get neither the type ofexperimental evidence that physics or chemistry requires or the rigorous proofs that mathematics canproduce.
Given the nature of language, we must settle for carefully reasoned arguments for our proposalsbased on limited and challengeable insights and many explicit and implicit assumptions.
In this respect,we resemble the =soft" social sciences.
Fortunately, we are also like engineering in that we should be ableto measure our results in terms of a body of useful techniques of limited utility characterized byappropriate case studies.
That  doesn't sound half bad to me; if only we were doing a good job of it!But I think we have some serious sociological problems that keep us from making faster progress.
Weseem to value the most theoretically ambitious research far out of proportion to its proven worth.
Suchwork has the best possibilities for publication and gets the most respect ;rom our colleagues.
In addition,jobs and funding aimed at achieving such results come with the least commitments.
All of these arenatural and good things- in limited amounts.Consider, however, what often results.
Sometimes we resemble a school of fish.
When our leaders turn,many of us turn with them.
Unification and connectionism are only the latest turning.
We do it all thetime.
Heck, I do it.
It's fun to work on new things; for the first few years there are lots of easy problemsto solve.
This schooling behavior probably happens in every field.
However, it is especially bad in ourcase because we rarely get the old technology worked out in enough detail to really evaluate its usefulness.117A related error on our part  finds us acting like Nfish out of water N when we enter the worlds of thephilosopher, linguist or psychologist.
Natural ly, we want the respect of the older disciplines that areconcerned with language.
However, their values can not possibly match ours very well.
Unfortunately,we have often ended up adopting theirs and abandoning our own.
When this happens the results of ourresearch have less and less likelihood of contributing to the progress of our computational discipline.Concluding the fish metaphor, it is clear that in order to communicate with them, we are going to have.meto ask our friends in other disciplines to learn to swim with us.I could explore some of the other problems that impede progress, such as our awful tendency to focus onsolutions to particular problems without thinking through their compatibi l i ty with solutions to otherproblems, our studied ignorance of earlier work, our willingness to accept unproven ideas as the basis forfurther work, and our tradition of not warning readers of known shortcomings of our results.
However,before you give up on me completely, let me suggest some future directions.WHAT CAN WE DO?Am I ready to give up on natural language processing?
Certainly not.
If I were, I would not be in myoffice on a perfectly gorgeous Southern California Sunday writing this.
In fact, I 'm more ready than everto push on.
As nice as Las Cruces and this meeting are, it 's hard for me to justify being away from mywork for three days.
Besides, the situation is not hopelesS.
I'l l refrain from pushing my favoritetechnology; instead, I'll try the trickier tactic of addressing our field's values.?
Our field exists because of one natural phenomenon, human language, and one technology, the computer.Our values must come from these two roots.
It  is easy to see that  we have to value the meanings anduses of human language in building our systems.
Clearly, the ult imate goal must be to understand orgenerate language in a way that matches what we see humans do.More important  o point out at this conference are the values from our computational root.
We haveshown some concern for computational complexity, but usually of the worst case sort, not the moreimportant average performance.
But there are other concerns as well; the ease of coding an algorithm,the ease of maintaining and enhancing a system, the portabil ity of the system, the way in which thesystem responds to output beyond its basic coverage, how it responds to ambiguity and vagueness, thefacilities available to tailor a system to an application," site, or user, and so on.
Probably, the mostconfusing pressure from computation comes to natural language interfaces from the fact that people endup communicating with the machine in ways that they would never communicate with other people.
Wemust value these realities as much as we value the demands of natural human communication.
Suchtopics should be discussed as often as anaphora, metaphor, conjunction, et al, are in our panels andpapers.Values of another sort have to come from the society that supports us.
It  is not just the ethics ofaccepting a salary; it is a matter of self-preservation.
We simply have to pay more attention to pushingour own ideas down the chain from theoretical research.
The outside world is not going to believe we are118making progress unless they see something come of our ideas in terms they can understand.
And if thepeople at this conference do not see to it that this happens, who will?
And if we do not do it now, whenwill we have the chance again?Given that  we want to take our ideas down the chain from theoretical research to empirical study andbeyond AND that natural language is an extremely difficult task, how can we proceed?
There is only oneanswer: work within our current limits.
Let's treat our.work as that of successive approximations.
Let usforget about the unexplored problems for the time being.
Let us see what we can really do with theproposals we have that seem to work.
Basically, let us emphasize building systems and full-scalecomponents for a while.For example, why don't  a group of .us take the best parser, the best semantic interpreter, the bestgenerator, the best inference system, etc., and tie them together?
Then let's pick a domain of discourseand make them work for more than a few sentences.
Let's beat on them until they work for as much oflanguage as they appear capable.
While we are at it, let's make the system as fast, as robust, as portable,as maintainable, etc., as we possibly can.
Similarly, let's beat on individual components in the same way.I know there is no guarantee this approach will produce a useful system or component.
But even if wefail to produce something worth going further with, we will have learned a lot about what works andwhat doesn't.
If those results are not allowed to be lost, the next effort can do better.Of course, a problem with this approach lies in the source of our funds.
Rare is the company or fundingorganization that  is not asking for new ideas and encouraging us to move on.
So we have to convincethem that stabil ity is necessary for systems building and the overall well-being of the field.Our field arose out of a perceived need for language processing systems.
The basic problem we have isthat we have not been able to produce these systems at the rate we had thought possible.
Unless we turnour pr imary attention to increasing the speed our theoretical ideas move out to initial demonstrations,initial demonstrations move out to prototype systems, and so on, we will face a serious crisis.
To bringthe point home, if we do not remember why the field of natural language processing exists and accept thenecessary values, I venture to guess that there will be little external support for a T INLAP in the not toodistant future.119
