Mornho loo ica l  ana lys i sAs the  nro to tyne  was be ing ,  rea l~sed  based  onand fo r  a l im i ted  cor ra l s ,  the  SL d ic t ionarywas made un o f  comnlete  fo rms  : the  work ingout  o f  a mornho log ica l  narser  i s  s imp lerthan  that  o f  a syntact i ca l  narser .2 .3 .
Syntact i ca l  ana lvs i sThe Aup-mented Transit ion Network (ATN) wasselected for the ana\]ysis : it had success-fully been used in many nrevious systems :I,UNAi~, SH!~DLII, \]INTEI,I,\]iC, T and, more recently,ENFISPAN (Leon, 1984).
T. ~'~\]no~rad nresentsthree networks in great detail  in his boo\]<'Lan~ua9e as a Cognit ive Process' (Winograd,1983).
These were taken as the basis forthe four (Sentence, Noun Phrase, Prenosit io-nal Phrase and Adjectival  Phrase) of the nro-totyDe, thus makin~ it nossible to sneed unthe develonment of a narser which had alrea-dy nroved itself in other resnects.The major i ty  of the modi f icat ions made tothe  \ ]~r ino~rad 's  ATN were  a imed at  inc reas in~i t s  ner fo rmance  (esnec ia \ ] l y  bv dea l in~ w i ththe  most  common cases  o f  coord inat ion)  aswe l l  as  i t s  determin is t  canac i t ies  therebyensur ing ,  the  accuracy  o f  the  in i t ia l  ana ly -s i s  sunn l ied  by  the  sys tem ( i t  :is ill fac t  onth i s  ana lys i s  that  the  t rans fer  operates  be -cause  the  mic ro -comnuter ' s  memory  was  satura -643ted before it had managed to supply all pos-sible analysis).2.4.
Disambiguat ionWithin the prototype framework, the creationof a disambiguat ion sub-component would havetaken up too much time and would not have be-en useful part icular ly that this research isdel iberately designed to apply to only a li-mited corpus in which most of the ambigui-ties concern the Preposit ional Phrase attach-ment and need not be solved for the transla-tion if English into French.2.5.
Source-Language dict ionaryFor the various reasons explained above, thedict ionary includes only complete forms.All variable words are character ised by dif-ferent syntactical :features, certain ofwhich concern their form, others do not.All of these are treated by the analysis com-ponent.
Semantic features could easily beadded at a later stage.Words forming certain 'traditiona\]' classesmay belong to various categories of the ~ro-totype dictionary.
This is notably the casewith cardinal adjectives, which are at onceclassif ied as determiners and substantives.At present, the only compounds that the pro-totype dict ionary accepts are locutions witha maximum of two consecutive words.
Longerlocutions, compound verbs and other disconti-nuous compounds~ quite rare in the corpus,will be treated as follows at a later sta~e:all words liable to appear in compounds willbe tagged with a nointer to this effect, toenable the preprocessing sub-comnonent to de-termine whether a compound or simple form ispresent in a given text.Numbers were not introduced into the prototy-pe dictionary.
The parser would accent themif a routine were created that would automa-tical ly attribute noun and determiner catego-ries to them.3.
"Transfer" componentThe transfer component deals with the re-sults obtained by the analysis component.3.1  .
S t ruc tura l  t rans ferBy deal ing<with the structural transferfirst, one is saved, notably, from having towaste time translating forms that will dulybe dropped (such as 'will'), since the adap-tation to tense in French is done along withthe structural transfer.The structural transfer operates on the sen-tence as a whole, on various levels.
It on-ly saves those results of the analysis thatare pert inent for the generation.3.1 .1 .
SentenceThe various constituent elements of the clau-644se are rewritten so as to conform to the fol-lowing seauence :(Pass ive)  + (Negat ive)  + Ro le  + NPl  + Auxi-l iaries + Verb  + (NP2)  + (NP3)  + PPNPI is the deep subject of the clause, NP2is the direct 'object (the attr ibute or evennothin~ at all if the main verb is of the'be' type) and NP3 is the indirect object.All nass\]ve clauses are out into the activevoice durlnv the analysis and structuraltransfer.
These are the transformationsthat, where necessary, regain the passivevoice in the process of generation intoFrench.3.1.2.
Noun PhraseThree  rewr i tes  a re  poss ib le  fo r  the  nounphrase  :- Number  + Pronoun- DNP ( 'dummy NP ' )- Number  + ( (Determiner )  + Noun + (Ad jec t ive)+ (Noun)  + (PP)  + (S ) )The rewrite elements are derived from vari-ous registers of the analysis result.3.1.3.
Verb PhraseBy Verb Phrase is understood here the Auxi-l iary together with the Main Verb.
This in-volves 'Auxiliary' in its widest sense, thatis compris ing all that precedes the verb :tcnse (present, inf init ive and/or imperfect),modal i ty and even person.
It should be no-ted that only third person forms appear inthe corpus studied.The verb phrase rewrites itself extensivelyin the fol lowing manner :(Infinitive) + Present/ Imperfect  + 3rd.n +(Avoir/Etre + Past Participle) + (Modal) +(Avoir/Etre + Past Participle) + VerbTo arrive at this rewrite, many rules thatcombine together are brought into play forvarious reasons concerning, notably, the mul-tiple feature categories, the treatment of'be', 'dummy be' and .
'dummy modal'.3.2.
Transfer dict ionaryIn En~l\]sh as in other languages, a word maybelon~ to several grammatical categories('all' is at once adverb, determiner and pro-noun) or, indeed, the same form may have va-rious dimensions ('read' has the features ofinfinitive, present (except for the 3rd per-son in the singular), and past as well aspast participle).
Besides, one word in Eng-lish may have several possible translat ionsin French.
For these reasons, it seemed con-venient to create a transfer dict ionary si-tuated in between source and target languagedict ionaries in order to avoid excessive mul-t ipl icat ion of relat ionships and also to fa-ci l i tate the extension of the system to o-ther language pairs.Unlike the English terms which are in thed ic t ionary  in  a complete  fo rm,  the i r  F rencht rans la t ions  a re  presented  in  canon ica l  fo rm.3 .3 .
