Incorporating New Words Detection with Chinese Word SegmentationHua-Ping ZHANG1   Jian GAO1  Qian MO 2  He-Yan HUANG11Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, P.R.C 1000812Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing, P.R.C 100048Email: kevinzhang@bit.edu.cnAbstractWith development in Chinese wordssegmentation, in-vocabulary wordsegmentation and named entityrecognition achieves state-of-artperformance.
However, new wordsbecome bottleneck to Chinese wordsegmentation.
This paper presents theresult from Beijing Institute ofTechnology (BIT) in the SixthInternational Chinese WordSegmentation Bakeoff in 2010.
Firstly,the author reviewed the problem causedby the new words in Chinese texts, thenintroduced the algorithm of new wordsdetection.
The final section providedthe official evaluation result in thisbakeoff and gave conclusions.1  IntroductionWith the rapid development of Internet withChinese language, word segmentation receivedextensive attention.
In-vocabulary word segmentationand named entity recognition have achieved state-of-artperformance.
Chinese words are actually not welldefined, and there is not a commonly acceptedsegmentation lexicon.
It is hard to collect allpossible new words, or predict new words occurredin the future.
New words is the bottleneck toChinese word segmentation.
The problem becamemore severe with word segmentation on specialdomain texts, such as computer, medicine andfinance.
There are much specialized words whichare difficult to be exported to the lexicon.
So newwords detection is very important, which wouldhave more substantial impact on the performanceof word segmentation than ambiguoussegmentation.In this paper?we presented a method of newwords detection, and then detailed the process ofChinese word segmentation incorporating newwords detection.
The last section provided theevaluation and gave our conclusions.2 Problem with new wordsIn the process of Chinese word Segmentation,there are many mistakes because of new words.These new words are Out of vocabulary (OOV), sothe system couldn?t distinguish them from originaltexts, and then impacted the results of wordsegmentation.We gave an example from Text C in medicinedomain to explain and detect the new words.?????????????????????????

?Here, both ??????

?are domain words, or new words beyond generalsegmentation lexicon.
Therefore, new words fromdomain should be detected and added tosegmentation lexicon before word segmentation.3 Word segmentation with new wordsdetection3.1 FrameworkWord Segmentation Withgeneral lexicon+domainlexiconFrequent StringDetectionNoAV statistics, languagemodelingGenerate New WordsDomainLexiconYesNew wordsthresholdOutputwordsFigure 1: The framework of Chinese word segmentationincorporating with new words detectionGeneralLexiconInput SentenceAs illustrated in Figure 1, Chinese wordsegmentation with new words detection is arecursive process.
The process is given asfollows:1.
Making Chinese word segmentation withdomain lexicon beyond general lexicon.2.
Frequent string (over twice) finding withpostfix tree algorithm, and taking them asnew words candidate.3.
Access Variety statistics [Haodi Feng etc.2004], and language modeling on wordformation.
[Hemin, 2006]4.
Exporting new words to domain lexicon.5.
Recursively, until no more new worddetected.6.
Output final word sequence.3.2 The process of new words detectionSimple word segmentation is the first step ofprocessing of Chinese language when we deal witha very long Chinese article.
The method of wordsegmentation is based on HHMM, and Zhang andLiu (2003) have given detailed explanation aboutthis.During the process of word segmentation inthe first, the system records the words which occurfrequently.
We can set a threshold value of words?occurrence frequency.
As long as the wordoccurrence frequency reaches this value, this wordcould be recorded in the system as frequent string.With the frequent strings detected, we can dothe further analysis.
For every frequent string, wecheck its left and right adjacent one in the originaltext segmented respectively.
Through this step, wefind the adjacent words which occur next to somefrequent string detected.
If the adjacent word alsooccurs very frequently, or even it occurs at the leftor right of the frequent string every time, it?s greatpossibility that the string detected and the adjacentword could merge into one word.With the detection in above steps, we gainnew words from Chinese texts.
Then we importthese new words into domain lexicon and ourlexicon is updated.
With the lexicon containingnew words, we can do the next cycle recursivelyand revise continually.Then, we can see this is a recursive structure.Through the continued process of wordsegmentation and new words detection, the state ofsegmentation tends to be steady.
The condition ofsteady state has several kinds such as no more newwords detected or the latest result equal to theprevious one.
At this time, we can break therecursion and output the final result.This is an example.
This sentence is fromText D in finance domain???????????????????????????????
(?The financial markethas been stable and the stock has rebounded in lessthan one year time after Lehman BrotherCorporation went bankrupt.?
)After word segmentation with originallexicon, this altered sentence is:??/?/??/??/??/?/?/?/?/?/????/??/??/?/??/?/?/??/?/???????
is a new word as a organizationname and it is hard to be collected.
Like this kindof word, there are difficulties to add new words toupdate the lexicon in time.
So it is normal tosegment this word ??????
into three words.Through frequent string detection, we gain thesethree words ??
?, ??
?and ????.
With theadjacent analysis, we find the word ???
occurs 6times, ???
3 times and ????
3 times.The character ???
occurs 3 times in thedetected word ?????
and 3 times at the left ofthe word ???.
So we can consider the word ????
as a whole word.Then we can easily find the words ????
arealways at the right of words ????.
So it?snecessary to consider ??????
as a wholeword.4  EvaluationThe performance of word segmentation ismeasured by test precision (P), test recall (R), Fscore (which is defined as 2PR/(P+R)) and theOOV recall rate.In this competition, our test corpus involvedliterature, computer, medicine and Finance, totally425KB.
We take 6 months data of The People'sDaily to be the training corpus.
From Table 1, wecan see the official evaluation result.Table 1.
Official evaluation resultOur system got high Precision Rate andRecall Rate after testing the texts in four domains,especially Recall Rate is all over 95%.
And wealso could see that this system detected most newwords through several measures of OOV,especially IV RR is all over 97.5%.
This provedthat the system could be able to get a nice resultthrough processing professional articles inliterature, computer, medicine and finance domains,and we believed it also could do well in otherdomains.
This also proved that the method of newwords detection with Chinese word segmentationwas competitive.5ConclusionThrough this competition, we?ve found a lotof problems needed to be solved in Chinese wordsegmentation and tried our best to improve thesystem.
Finally, we proposed the method of newwords detection in Chinese word segmentation.But we still had some shortage during theevaluation and need to improve in the future.ReferencesLawrence.
