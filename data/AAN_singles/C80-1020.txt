--- AN APPROACH TO A SEMANTIC ANALYSIS OF METAPHOR ---Fumio MIZOGUCHI*, Akihiko YAMAMOTO*,* Department of Industrial AdministrationTokyo University of ScienceNoda, Chiba 278, JapanAbstractThe present study deals with conflict resolution process in metaphoricalinterpretation for the noun phrase.
In order to make the problem mbre explicit, wehave reviewed the knowledge representation with conflict both from cognitivepsychology and artificial intelligence.
Then, we propose a semantic model which isobtained from the notion of Linguistics as Chemistry.
That is, the model called"Semistry" is introduced so as to interprete a metaphor semantic bonds betweennouns.
By using production system couped with contex free parser (ELINGOL), theworking system called META-SIM is constructed to analyze the noun phrase metaphor.Finally, there are discussions on a role of metaphor in human cognitive processing.I.
IntroductionA conflict resolution in semantic analysisis regarded as an important problem in naturallanguage processing.
In case of a humancognitive system, this kind of problem wasdiscussed in the realm of behavioral decisionmaking theories, such as Festinger's (1957)theory of cognitive dissonance and Abelson's(1968) Psychological implication.
And also,it was discussed in the field of cognitivepsychology which dealt with the humaninformation processing mechanism, especiallylong-term memory (LTM) representation.The work of Kintsch (1969) in hisstructure of semantic memory was useful forinsight into the conflict resolution in lexicalitem stored in LTM.
He particularly made hisattention on the problems on how onesemantically unacceptable a sentence.If one selects the problem from artificialintelligence field, McDermott's (1974) TOPLE in"Ring formalism" was suggestive to a design ofinference mechanism which could interpreteunacceptable knowledge in a simple world model.This formarism also guided us about aconstruction of lexical data in naturallanguage processing.By following these current issures onknowledge representation, the present studyfocuses the problem of conflict resolution insemantic analysis of Metaphor both fromviewpoints of cognitive psychology andartificial intelligence.
For this purposes,we propose a new semantic model which can dealwith the metaphorical interpretation togetherwith the inference mechanism.
And then, wewill demonstrate examples of metaphoricalanalysis which is based on the proposedsemantic model.2.
Semantic representationwith conflict knowled~Metaphor plays an important role in ourunderstanding of language and of the world wedescribe through language.
Thus, there havebeen a number of researches on the nature ofmetaphor since the time of Aristotle.Recently, historical survey on metaphor wasmade by Ortony, Reynolds & Alter (1978) ontheir paper titled "Metaphor: Theoretical andEmpirical Research".
Their main concerns onmetaphor are to develop a model of metaphoriccomprehension both from Psychological reactiontime study and "Schema" based theoreticalframework.
To quote their paper:"The structure of a shema is of a seriesof variables together with relationships amongthem.
There are constraints on the valuesthat the variables may take, but theseconstraints are rarely absolute, although somevalues are typical than others.
This kind ofrepresentation system appears to offer greaterflexibility for matching incoming informationto previously stored knowledge, and with thisflexibility comes a better prospect for dealingwith nonliteral use of language.
Themetaphorical interpretation would be achievedby finding that schema or those schemata thatmatched the input in such a way as to minimizethe required changes in variable range.
"Certainly, the idea of schema describedabove is one of convergences on the knowledgerepresentations proposed by Rumelhart & Ortony(1977) and Bobrow & Norman (1975).
Here, theprocedure for the metaphorical interpretationis a kind of pattern-matching process which isbased on a semantically acceptableinterpretation.
In order to make a discussionmore explicit, let us consider the same type ofproblem which deals with knowledge aquisitionthrough the conflict or contradict resolution.For this purpose, we focus our attentionto the semantic structure which is stored in anunderstanding system.In case of Kintsch model, this problem isto define a lexical entry used in the semanticmemory.
And further, the notion ofacceptability of sentence is defined by the useof production rules which are applied to theset of propositions stored in memory system.If there exists a production rule for a set of136proposition, the sentence is semanticallyacceptable.
And if not, the sentence issemantically unacceptable.
Therefore, if twosentences are contradictory, the memory systemmust decide which one to keep and which one tOdisregard by choosing the one withacceptability.
In case of McDermot's TOPLE,this kind of contradiction is resolve throughthe notion of "ring" which can absorb theconfliction.
This process is accomplishedthrough a procedure called DOUBT.
By thisprocedure, the system can find the allowablecourse of action to take to patch up a ring.In this connection, Tanaka (1980) in his SRL,this procedure is carried out through the useof production rule called "withoutdescription".
In SRL representation which isan extension of Bobrow & Winograd's KRL,knowledge is organized around conceptualentities with associated descriptions andprocedures.
Therefore, by embedding variousprocedures to knowledge, lexical item isrepresented by knowledge unit with associateddescriptions and procedures.
One type ofconceptual entities is the use of hiearchcalrelation which was actively utilized by thework of Carbonell's SCHOLAR (1970).
In SRL,hiearchical concept is accomplished throughpart-whole and class-inclusion relations.
Andfurther, the conflict resolution was made bythe use of the without description.
Incontrast to TOPLE, a bird like Pengin isrepresented by the following way.
(PENGINunit(self (a TORI without(hasp = TOBU )))(part-of nil)other descriptions )Fig.
l SRL's description for penginAlthough we made a quick overview of therelated topic on the knowledge with conflictresolution, it is necessary to consider asemantic model which can accept semanticallyconflict knowledge.
That is, any lexical itemstored in the understanding system shouldprocess a change of meaning through themetaphorical use.In this section, we will propose a newsemantic model in which semantic elements arecompared to chemical elements.
Here, chemicalelements.are refered to the dynamic aspect ofmeaning.
In a sense, the theory can beconsidered as an extension of Arnold Zwicky's1973 paper, "Linguistics as Chemistry", inAnderson & Kiparsky (Eds.
), A Festschrift forMorris Halle.
In this connection, somepreliminary work on "Linguistic Chemistry" wascarried out by Harada & Mizoguchi (1977) inwhich semantics and lexical elements were alsocompared to chemical elements (such asmolecules, atoms, protons, neutrons andelecrtons).
A large part of syntax is nowcompared to a theory of semantic "bondage".The semantic equivalent of 'chemical reaction'is a theory of semantic amalgamation.
Theanalogy with chemistry may not be completelyfelicitous, but at the present moment it is aleast useful in shaping a new theory ofsemantics.The first step for constructing achemically interpreted model of semantics, or"Semistry", so to speak, is to study thebondage among atoms and molecules.
For this,it is necessary to develop a theory of valence.Valence is defined as the capacity of an atomto enter into chemical (or semantic)combination with other atoms.
It is possibleto assign a value to the valence displayed byan atom in particular compound.
This notionmust be the reader who is well-informed of theEuropean tradition of "Valenzgrammatik".Here, however, we will develop a theory ofvalence totally independently of Europeantradition.Before going into a detail of Semistry,let us show you a concrete exsample which isselected from Schank (1973) of his ConeepualDependency theory (CDT for short).
Here,"Semantic primitives of CDT" are compared tochemical elements.
In the chemical elements,there are three types of chemical bondages; i.Single bond 2.
Double bond 3.
Tripple bond.If we look at CDT representation of a sentencethrough the viewpoint of Semistry, we willrecognize a Similarity between chemicalmolecules and CD structure.
From thisinsight, we can make a analogy of semantic'isomer', depending on a mode of bondagebetween the semantic primitives.
Forexsample, CD structure of PP(picture producer)and ACT (action) is represented in the Fig.2 inwhich two way dependency is interpreted as adouble bond in case of Semistry.
If one ofthe valence shifts to another pair of primitiveas shown in Fig.
2, then the structure is calledsemantic resonance.In case of PP with the extra valence, somemodifiers will be possible to link theactivated part of PP.
If the activation willoccur at the ACT, the extra valence part willbe embedded with the related case in CDT.Since it is not the purpose of the presentpaper to develop an impecable account ofSemistry, let us take another example from alexical item which is related to the presentstudy.In the analysis of lexical structure,words are not really defined in the standarddictionaries in any precise way in case of thehuman cognitive system.
There are variousmeans to be employed to indicate their meaningmore or less vaguely, but these means areusually sufficient for the cognitiveprocessing.
They may be extralinguistic means(such as diagram) or linguistic definition,both explicit and implicit.

2 V iew o\[ semis t ry  in to  Cu theroytot  Semant ic  resonance  representat ioB .are of much use for the construction ofmetaphor processing system.In case of metaphorical analysis, thelexical item must be defined with an inclusionof semantically unacceptable feature.
This isrepresented by the following way as shown inFig?3.The format of lexical item is adapted by theuse of distributed semantic links (or Singlebonds) between words.
That is, a word orlexical item is surrounded with semanticfeatures S I, S 2, ... S n.These bonds between word and semanticfeatures are usually single bonds withhomogeneous tention.
In that case, theresonance is observed among the semanticfeatures of word.
In case of metaphoricalsemantic analysis, especially, noun-noun phase,SlSn I /$2$1Sn _ J .w $2S4 sQ,,,antic f~t.re, 54$I Sn-15 4 52l e lnant l c  bond th?oucJh S}.sn-1Sn~ i i /52  I Snl , /s/M " 2 ~: t ~SIS 4 $2F ig ,3  I{epresentat ion  of  lex ica l  i temin semant ic  bond.the first noun modifies the second.
So, theresonance is broken and the first noun inmetaphorical relationship must include themeaning that is interpreted by the second.Therefore, in order to determine the meaning ofa noun phase, there must be an intersection ofmeaning between M* and M. If suchintersection exsists between the first and thesecond, the double bond is constructed in theFig.3.
In this way, word definition can beturned by adding procedure for unacceptablesemantic link.
The process is regarded assemantic change of meaning from Semistry'sviewpoint.
The change of meaning in metaphoris classified by the following categoricaltransformation as is shown in Table i.Thus, the idea of Semistry is proposed soas to meet the present purpose of metaphorsemantic analysis.

Metaphorical Transformationcalled META-SIM is designed and tried outthrough the use of ELINGOL developed by Tanakaet al(1978).3a Metaphor analysis of noun phras eIn this section, we show the case studybased on the idea shown before.
At the firststage, we analyzed a noun-noun metahpor usingELINGOL couped with production system designedwith a viewpoint of standard control structure.The present studies focus on a noun-phrase inmetaphorical use in Japanese, such asI.

M* no m* SIM M(or m).
(m* of M* SIM M(or m))3.
M*(or m*) SIM M no m.(M*(or m*) SIM m of M)4.
M*(or m*) SIM M(or m)In the above notation, SIM represents asimilarity between two nouns in Simile, and anoun denoted a small letter is a part of noundenoted a capital letter.In this case study, we use a ELINGOL(Extended Linguistic Oriented Language) for theparser (systactic analyzer).
The ELINGOL is acontex free parser extended at ETL, and it hasa semantic processing parts that the user canwrite any semantic processing program in termsof LISP.DictionarxThe description in dictionary used in thiscase study is as in Fig.
4Each dictionary item consists of four parts,the first is item of the word, the second isthe syntactic category of the word, the thirdis the part used in case of some ambiguities,(MQMIJI NQU~ (HIL O)"(MQMIJIUMIT<SELF SHOKUBUTSU)(PRRT-OP MID(~EM-FERTURE<SIZE = ,,4,~)CPRRT-OF-FEATURE (H~ (SIZE ~ CHIISQI))))) )(TE IIOUN (HIL O)" (TEUNIT(SELF NIL>(PRRT-OP NI NBEM)(SEM-FEBTURE(SIZE = ~)(P-PROPERTY = ~,e-~.

In theabove representation, there are some specialslots or semantic feature ?
The SELF slotrepresents a semantic category of the noun forthe top node in part-whole relation network.PART-OF slot represents a upper node of thenoun in part-whole relation network.
InSEM-FEATURE, PART-OF-FEATURE represents somespecial feature of the components of the noun,and MATA-NOUN represents a restriction of thecompared parts for the modifier noun category.GrammarThe description in grammar used in thiscase study is as shown in Fig.

5 GrammarEach grammar consists of four parts, the firstand the second parts represent a contex freerule of A --- B (C), the third is used in caseof some ambiguities, and in the fourth part, wedescribe any semantic processing procedures.In Fig.
5, the fourth part describe a LISPfunction for metaphorical semantic processingwhich is considered in the next section.Procedure fo_j Metaj0horical semantic processingFirst, a input string must be parsedthrough ELINGOL and produce a parsing treewhich is one of the control structure forsemantic analysis.In order to interprete a noun phrase, ameaning of a phrase is constructed by seekingthe semantic relation between noun and noun in--139the noun phrase.
So, at first, two nouns tobe interfered must be chosen, the choice isdesided in terms of a syntactic structure andsemantic part-whole relation network, because,in Japanese, there are many paraphrase only onenoun phrase that has same meaning.Then, a new semantic interpretation isobtained from a intersection which isaccomplished through the search of the two noundefinitions.
When an intersection occurs, thesystem focuses the matched semantic featuresextracted in the search to construct aninterpretation.
Thus, the search processcorresponds to the conflict resolution processto produce the "infered meaning".
In thisway, interpretation of metaphorical use isaccomplished.Here, we show the detailed semanticprocedure for each cases shown before.
(I) noun-i + noun-2, MetaphorTop level function : NPSEMProcedore :By metaphorical interference between noun-I andnoun-2, metaphorical semantics is obtained froma intersection of semantic features between twonouns.
(II - i) M* no m* S IMM no m, SimileTop level function : MTSEMIProcedure :First, by comparing noun semantic between M*and m* to that of M and m, the system candecide the semantic of "M* no m*" and "M no m".Then metaphorical semantics is obtained bycontrasting noun phrase semantic between thesemantic of "M* no m*" and that of "M no m".
(II - 2) M* no m* SIM M(or m), SimileTop level function : MTSEM23Procedure :First, by comparing two noun semantics betweenM* and m*, the system can decide the semanticof "M* no m*", then metaphorical semantic isobtained by contrasting the semantic between"M* no m*" and M(or m).
(II - 3) M*(or m*) S IMM no m, SimileTop level function : MTSEM3Procedure :First, by comparing noun semantic between M andm, the system can decide the semantic of "M nom".
In this type, noun phrase contrasting hasthree types.
The first type is in case thatm* of M* is omitted because of m*=m.
In thiscase, by comparing noun semantic between M* andm* (=m), the system can decide the semantics of"M* no m*", and then, metaphorical semantics isobtained by contrasting noun phrase semanticbetween "M* no m*" and "M no m".
The secondtype is in case that m* of M* is omitted but m*is restricted by META-NOUN description m*' ofm.
In this case, by comparing noun semanticbetween M* and m*', the system can decide thesemantic of "M* no m*'", and then, metaphoricalsemantics is obtained by contrasting nounphrase semantic between "M* no m ~''' and "M nom".
The third type is other cases.
In thiscase, by comparing semantic between M*(or m*)and that of "M no m".
(II - 4) M*(or m*) SIM M(or m), SimileTop level function : MTSEM4Procedure :In this type, semantic procedure is as same astype (II - 3) without comparing noun semanticbetween M and m.Results of case studiesResults of some case studies are shown inF ig .6 ,  F ig .

In order to make the discussion moreexplicit, we have reviewed the problem oni conflict resolution both from cognitivepsychology and artificial intelligence.Especially, we have made our attention to theproblem of knowledge representation in humanlong-term memory and AI system.
In thisconnection, the procedure for dealing withsemantically unacceptable knowledge is stressedfor the understanding of metaphor.
That is,we have considered the dynamic aspect ofmeaning for word or lexical item in metaphor.In order to penetrate the problem onrepresentation of meaning in metaphor, the ideaof "Semistry" is introduced so as to analyzethe conflict resolution in semanticinterpretation.
The idea of Semistry has beenderived from the notion of Zwicky's paper on"Linguistics as Chemistry" which ismetaphorical interpretation on Chemistry.
Byapplying the notion into semantic structure oflexical item, the dynamic aspect of meaning isexplaind by introducing the idea of "semanticbonds" which have further constructed semanticresonance among semantic features.
A usualmeaning is determined from the single bondsbetween word and semantic features.
In orderto determine the meaning of noun-noun phrasemetaphor, there must be an intersection ofmeaning between the first and the second nouns.This kind of intersection is accomplishedthrough the procedure for finding the matchedsemantic properties of the first and the secondnouns.The proposed semantic model is designedand tried out for dealing with the noun phrasemetaphor through the use of ELINGOL.
Here, byparsing tree and LISP function in grammar, theinference system to resolve the conflict ofsemantic interpretation of metaphor wasconstructed.
That is, the metaphor processingsystem would comprise a lexical item or wordand associated inference mechanism to extractthe meaning of metaphor.
In order to proofthe idea, the working system for the nounphrase is implemented by means of UCI-LISP(DEC-20) or HLISP (HITAC 8800-8700) and triedout with case studies.As the conclusions, we have shown apossibility for approaching a semantic analysisof metaphor from an actual working system.These cases are selected from the book called"A Stylistic Study of the Figuratives"(Nakamura, 1977).
At the present state,number of items in dictionary is about 150.First, a new semantic model is proposedfor dealing with metaphor.
The idea ofsemantic resonance is introduced to explain"semantic bonds" which is derived from thecomparison with Linguistic as Chemistry.Therefore, a role of metaphor is demonstratedin the present semantic model.Second, the ELINGOL is utilized to unifythe syntactic processing with the associatedinference mechanism to extract metaphoricalinterpretation.142Third, metaphor processing system calledMETA-SIM is designed and tried out through casestudies.
We have discussed our experienceswhich was based upon the results of workingsystem for metaphor processing system.Although the present system and casestudies are restricted to the noun-noun phrase,the meaning of smaller phrase can be useful tobuild up semantic analysis of larger phrase ofmetaphor.
In this sense, the present study isthe first step toward the semantic analysis ofmetaphor which has not been explored in thenatural understanding system.
And further,the study of metaphor will give us about muchmore fruitful inference mechanism forinterpreting semantically unacceptablesentence.
In the future, the role of metaphormust investigate for both educational purposeand design philosophy of any understandingsystem.5_uAqknowledgementsWe indebted to many persons forsuggestions and encouragement, especially toDr.
