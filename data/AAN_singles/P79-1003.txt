WORD EXPERT PARSING lSteven L. SmallDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of MarylandCollege Park, Maryland 20742This paper describes an approach to conceptual analysis and understanding of natural language in whichlinguistic knowledge centers on individual words, and the analysis mechanisms consist of interactionsamong distributed procedural experts representing that knowledge.
Each word expert models the processof diagnosing the intended usage of a particular word in context.
The Word Expert Parser performsconceptual analysis through the Interactlons of tl~e individual experts, which ask questions andexchange information in converging on a single mutually acceptable sentence meaning.
The Word Experttheory is advanced as a better cognitive model of natural language understanding than the traditionalrule-based approaches.
The Word Expert Parser models parts o~ tSe theory, and the important issues ofcontrol and representation that arise in developing such a model \[orm the basis of the technicaldiscussion.
An example from the prototype LISP implementation helps explain the theoretical resultspresented.\[.
IntroductionComputational understanding of natural languagerequires complex Interactions among a variety of distinctyet redundant mechanisms.
The construction of a computerprogram to perform such a task begins with thedevelopment of  an organ izat iona l  framework whichInherent ly  .
incorporates  cer ta in  assumptions about thenature ot these processes and the environment in whichthey take place.
Such cogn i t ive  premises a f fec tnro?oundly the scope and substance of  computational~nalys is  fo r  comprehension as found in  the program.This paper descr ibes a theory of  conceptual parsingwhich considers knowledge about language to bed is t r ibuted  across a co l lec t ion  of procedural  expertscentered on ind iv idua l  words.
Natural  language parsingwith word experts  enta i l s  several  new hypotheses aboutthe organ izat ion  and representat ion  o f  l ingu is t i c  andpragmat ic  knowledge for computational languagecomprenension.
The Word Expert Parser  \[1\] demonstrateshpw the word expert qTt~T~ed w?~h cer ta in  ocherchoices oaseo on previous work, affect structure andprocess  in a cogn i t ive  model of pars ing .The Word Expert Parser is  a cognitive model ofconceptual language ana lys i s  in  which the un i t  o fl tngu~st ic  knowledge is  the word and the fqcu~ o~research ts the set or processes unoerlyinRcomprehension.
The model is aimed directly at problem~of word sense ambiguity and idiomatic expressions, and ingreatly generalizing the notion of wora sense, promotesthese issues to a central place in the study of languageparsing.
Parsing models typically cope unsatisfactorilywith the wide heterogeneity of usages of particularwords.
If a sentence contains a standard form of a word,it can usually be parsed; if it involves a less prevalentform which has a different par t  of speech,  perhaps it toocan be parsed.
Disti.nguishing amen 8 the ~any senses of acommon vero ,  ad jec t ive ,  or pronoun, ta r  example, orcorrectly translating idioms are rarely poss ib le ,At the source of this difficulty is the reliance onrule-based formalisms, whethar syntactic or semantic(e.g.. cases), which attempt to capture ~he l inguist iccontributions inherent in constituent chunks or sentencesthat consist of more than single words.
A crucialassumption underlying work on the Word Expert Parser isthat the ~undamental unit of linguistic Knowledge is theword.
and that understanding its sense or role in apar t i cu la r  context  is  the cent ra l  pars ing  process .

This in turn, causesboth the resumption and termination of the "deep" expertas well as the closure of the concept bin to whlch the~oelong.
At the closing of the concept bin, the "intoexper t  resumes, marks its concept as a location, andterminates.
With all the word experts completed and allconcept bins  closed, the expert fo r  ".'"
runs andcompletes the parse.
The concept level workspace nowcontains five concepts: a picture concept designating anintellectual philosopher, an event concept representingthe throwing action, another picture concept describing afruit pit which came from a peach,  a setting conceptrepresenting a location, and the picture concept whichdescribes precisely the nature of this location.
Work onthe mechanism to determine the schematic roles of theconcepts has just begun, and is described briefl~ later.A program trace that shows the actions ot the Nora ExpertParser on the example just presented is available onrequest.3.
Structure of the ModelThe organization of the parser centers around datarepositories on two levels -- the sentence levelworkspace contains a word bin for each word (andsub-lexical morpheme) of the input and the concept levelworkspace contains a concept bin (described above) foreach concept referred to in the input sentence.
A thirdlevel of processing, the schema level workspaee, whilenot yet implemented, will contain a schema for eachconceptual action of the input sentence.
All actionsaffecting the contents  of these data bins are  car r ied  outby the word expert processes, one of which is associatedwith each word bin in the wo rkspace.
In addition to thisfirst order information about lexical and conceptualobjects, the parser contains a central tableau of controls ta te  descriptions available to any expert that  can makeuse of self referential knowledge about its ownprocessing or the states of processing of other modelcomponents.
The availability of such control stateinformation improves considerably both the performanceand the psychological appeal of the model -- each wordexpert attempting to disambiguate its contextual usageknows precise ly  t~e progress of its neighbors and thestate of convergence (or the lack thereof) of the entirepars ing  process .Word ExpertsThe pr inc ipa l  knowledge s t ruc ture  of the model i sthe word sense d i sc r iminat ion  exper t .

2use as rh~graphic represeptatlon of an augmented transltlon networ~aemonstrates the basic control paradigm of the ATNparsing approach, a graphic representation for wordexperts exists which embodies its functional framework.Each word expert derives from a branching discriminationstructure called a word sense discrimination network orsense net.
A sense nec consists of an ordered se~ of?
/~tr~Ti~g (the nodes of the network), and for each one,the set of possible answers to that question (thebranches emanating from each node).
T raversa l  of a sensenetwork represents the process of converging on a singlecontextual usage of a word.
The terminal nodes of asense net represent d is t inc t  word senses of the wordmodeled by the network.
A sense net for the word "heavy"appears in part (a) of Figure 2.
Examination of thisnetwork reveals that four senses are represented -- thethree adjective usages shown in Figure 1 plus the numinalsense of "thug" as In "Joe's heavy told me to beat it.
"Expert RepresentationThe network representat ion  of a word exper t  leavesout certain computational necessities of actually usingit for parsing.
A word expert has two fundamentalactivities.
(I) An expert asks questions about thelexical and conceptual data being amassed by itsneighbors, the control states of various modelcomponents, and more general issues requiring commonsense or knowledge of the physical world.
(2) Inaddition, at  each node an expert performs act ions  toaffect the lexical and conceptual contents of theworkspaces,  the control states of itself, concept bins,6An ATN without arbitrarily complex LISP computationson each arc  and at  each node, that  i s .7In addition to common sense knowledge of the physicalworld,  this could include information about the plot,characters, or focus of a children's story ,  or in aspec ia l i zed  domain such as medical diagnosis \ [17\ ] ,  couldi nc lude  highly domain spec i f i c  knowledge.and the parser as a whole, and the model's expectations.The current procedural representation of the word expertfor "heavy" appears as part (b) of Figure 2.Each word expert process Includes threecomponents -- a declarative header, a start node, and abody.
The header provides a description of the expert'sbehavior for purposes of inter-expert constraintforwarding.
If sense discrimination by a word expertresults in the knowledge that a word to its right, eithernot yet executed or suspended, must map to a specificsense or conceptual category, then it should constrain itto do so, thus helping it avoid unnecessary processing orfallacious reasoning.
Since word experts are representedas processes, constraining an expert consists of alteringthe pointer to the address at which it expects tocontinue execution.
Through its descriptive header, anexpert conditions this activity and insures that it takesplace without disastrous consequences.Each node in the body of the expert has a typedeslgnated by a letter following the node name.
either Q(question), A (action), S (suspend), or T (terminal).
Bytracing through the question nodes (treating the othersas vacuous except for their gore pointers), a sensenetwork for each word expert process can be derived.
Thegraphical framework of a word expert (and thus thequestions it asks) represents its principal linguistictask of word sense disamblguatlon.
Each question nodehas  a type, shown following the Q in the.node -- MCtmultiple choice), C (conditional), YN (yes/no/, and PI(posslble/Imposslble).
In the example  expert for"heavy", node nl represents a conditional query into thestate of the entire parsing process, and n?de n\[2 amultiple choice question involving the conceptual natureof the word to "heavy"s  right in the input sentence.b Multiple choice questions typically delve into theaslc relations among ob3ects ann actions zn the world.For example, the question asked at node n12 of the"heavy" expert is typical:"Is the object to my right better described asan artistic object a a form of precipitation, ora phys ica l  object?Action nodes in the "heavy" expert perform such tasks asdetermining the concept bin to which it contributes, andpqstin 8 expectations for the word to its right.
In termsot its side effects, the "heavy" expert is fairly simple.A full account of the word expert representation languagewill be available next year \[12\].Expert QuestionsThe bas ic  s t ruc ture  of the Word Expert  Parserdepends pr inc ipa l ly  on the ro le  of ind iv idua l  wordexper ts  in  a f fec t lug .

is anexample.12could either be one that already exists in the workspaceor a new one created by the expert at the time of itsdecision.
After deciding on a concept, the principalrole of a (content) word expert is to discriminate amongthe possibly many remaining senses of the word.
Notethat a good deal of this disambiguation may take placeduring the initial phase of concept determination.
Afterasking enough questions to discover some piece ofconceptual data, this data augments what already existsin  the word's concept 5 in ,  inc lud ing dec la ra t ives t ruc tures  put there both by itself and by the otherlexical participants in that concept.
The parsecompletes when each word expert in the .workspace nasterminated.
At this point, the concept ievez worKspacecontains a complete conceptual interpretation ot theinput text.Conceptual Case ResolutionAdequate conceptual parsing of input text regulres astage missing from this dlscusslon and constituting thecurrent phase of research --- the attachment of eachpicture and setting concept (bin) to the appropriateconceptual case of an event concept.
Such a mechanismcan be viewed in an entirely analogous fashion to themechanisms just described for performln 8 localdisamblguation of word senses.
Rather ~han word experts,however, the experts on this level are conceptual innature.
The concept level thus becomes the main level ofactivity and a new level, call it the schema levelworkspace, turns into the ma~n repository rot inferredIn format ion .
When a concept bin has c losed,  a conceptexpert is retrieved from a disk file, and initialized.If it is an event concept, its function is to fill itsconceptual cases with settings and pictures; if it is asetting or picture, it must aetermlne its schematic role.The activity on this level, therefore, involves higherorder processing than sense discrimination, but occurs inJust about the same way.
The ambiguities involved inmapping known concepts in to  conceptual case schemataappear ident ica l  to those having to do with ma2ping wordsin to  concepts.
Discovering that the word "p i t  maps in  acer ta in  context  to the not ion  of  a " f ru i t  p i t "  requiresthe same ab i l i t i es  and knowledge as rea l i z ing  that  "thered house" maps in some context  to the not ion  of  "a~ocation for smoking pot and listening to records".
Theimplementation of the mechanisms to carry out this nextlevel of inferential disambiguation has already begun.It should be quite clear that this schematic level is byno means the end of the line -- active expert-baseo p~otfollowing and general text understanding flt nicely Int?the word expert framework and constitute its loglca~extension.4.

Many torms of  l ingu is t i c  annnon-lln~uistlc knowledge are  available to these expertsIn performing the i r  task ,  including control s ta teKnowledge and knowledge of the world, and by eliminatinga l l  but the mpst pers i s tent  forms o f  ambiguity,  theparser models numan processing.This new model of  parsin?
claims a number o ftheoret i ca l  advantages: (I) I t s  representations oflinguistic knowledge reflect the enormous redundancy innatura l  languages - -  without th i s  redundancy in  themodel, the in ter -exper t  handshaking (seen in  many..formsin  the example parse) would not be poss ib le .
~z) ~nemodel suggests some in teres t ing  approaches to languageacquisition.
Since much of a word expert's knowledge Isencoded in a branching discrimination structure,, addlngnew information about a word involves the addition oz anew branch.
This branch would be placed in the expert atthe point where the contextual clues for dlsambiguatlngthe new usage differ from those present for a knownusage .
(3) Idiosyncratic uses of langua8@ are easilye ncooea, s~nce the wore expert provides a c~esr way to noso.
These uses are indistinguishable from other uses intheir encodings in the model.
(4) The parser representsa cognltively plausible model or se~uentlalcoroutine-like processing in human ~anguageunderstanding.
The organization of linguistic knowledgearound the word, rather than the rewrite rule, motivatesinteresting conjectures about the flow of control In ahuman language understander.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI would llke to thank Chuck Rieger for his Insights,encouragement, and general manner.
