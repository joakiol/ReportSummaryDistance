Lower and higher estimatesof the number of ?true analogies?between sentences contained in a large multilingual corpusYves LepageATR Spoken Language Translation Research LabsHikari-dai 2-2-2, Keihanna Science City619-0288 Kyo?toJapanyves.lepage@atr.jpAbstractThe reality of analogies between words is re-futed by noone (e.g., I walked is to to walk as Ilaughed is to to laugh, noted I walked : to walk:: I laughed : to laugh).
But computational lin-guists seem to be quite dubious about analogiesbetween sentences: they would not be enoughnumerous to be of any use.
We report experi-ments conducted on a multilingual corpus to es-timate the number of analogies among the sen-tences that it contains.
We give two estimates,a lower one and a higher one.
As an analogymust be valid on the level of form as well as onthe level of meaning, we relied on the idea thattranslation should preserve meaning to test forsimilar meanings.1 IntroductionA long tradition in linguistics views analogy as ameans for the speaker to analyze or produce newsentences1.
To be linguistically relevant, an analogyshould hold on the level of form as well as on thelevel of meaning.In contrast to that, in Greek and Latin antiquity,anomaly designated those cases2 where an analogyof meaning is not reflected by an analogy of form.
(e.g., ?I drink.?
: ?I?d like to drink.?
:: ?I can swim.?
: ?I?d like to be able to swim.
?3).Conversely, the existence of analogies of formthat are not verified on the level of meaning has beentaken by the Generativists to indicate the indepen-dence of syntax (e.g., Abby is baking vegan pies.
:Abby is baking.
:: Abby is too tasteful to pour gravy1See, inter alia, (PAUL, 1920, chap.5), (de SAUSSURE,1995, 3rd part, chap.
iv), (BLOOMFIELD, 1933, p.276),(MOUNIN, 1968, p.119?120), (ITKONEN, 1994, p.48?50),(PULLUM, 1999, p.340?343).2In those times, the cases considered were in fact in mor-phology (See, .e.g., VARRO, De lingua latine).3The meaning ?I?d like to be able to swim.?
cannot be con-strued as ?I?d like to can swim.on vegan pies.
: Abby is too tasteful to pour gravyon.4).The purpose of this study is to estimate the num-ber of ?true analogies?
present in a large corpus, i.e.,analogies which hold both on the level of form, aswell as on the level of meaning.Formally, let us denote ?A?
as some meaning, andL(?A?)
as the set of all possible ways of realising?A?
in a particular language L. Let us denote A assome realisation of ?A?, i.e., A ?
L(?A?).
With thesenotations, we want to count, in a given corpus, allcases where the following holds5.A ?
L(?A?)
?B ?
L(?B?)
?C ?
L(?C?)
?D ?
L(?D?)
?A : B :: C : D ?
?A?
: ?B?
:: ?C?
: ?D?The reason for estimating the number of ?trueanalogies?
in a large corpus comes from the factthat it has been felt that ?true analogies?
betweensentences are rare.
There is a general feeling thatanalogy is well attested between words, i.e., on thelevel of morphology, but not so much between sen-tences6.
We will show that, at least in the corpus weused, this feeling has to be reconsidered.4In the third sentence, gravy is poured on vegan pies, whileit is poured on Abby (!)
in the fourth sentence.
This is notparallel to the first and second sentences where Abby plays thesame role.
This would imply that there is something about topour which does not come directly from its form nor from itsmeaning.5Needless to say, we disregard trivial cases of the formA : A :: A : A and A : A :: C : C.6It is not our purpose to address this issue, but the claimthat some necessary analogies cannot be built from linguisticdata available to children constitutes in fact the basis of the?arguments from the poverty of the stimulus.?
See (PULLUMand SCHOLTZ, 2002) and (LEGATE and YANG, 2002).2 The corpus usedFor this study, we used the Basic Traveler?s Expres-sion Corpus, or BTEC, for short7.
This is a mul-tilingual corpus of expressions from the travel andtourism domain.
It contains 162,318 aligned trans-lations in several languages.
Here, we shall use Chi-nese, English and Japanese.
There are 96,234 dif-ferent sentences in Chinese, 97,769 in English and103,274 in Japanese8.
The sentences in BTEC arequite short as the figures in Table 1 show.3 Analogies on the level of form3.1 MethodOn the level of form, a possible formalisation ofanalogy between strings of symbols has been pro-posed (LEPAGE, 2001) which renders an account ofsome analogies9.A : B :: C : D ????
?a, |A|a + |D|a = |B|a + |C|adist(A,B) = dist(C,D)dist(A,C) = dist(B,D)Here, a is a character, whatever the writing system,and A, B, C and D are strings of characters.
|A|astands for the number of occurrences of a?s in A.dist(A,B) is the edit distance between strings Aand B, i.e., the minimal number of insertions anddeletions10 of characters necessary to transform Ainto B.Obviously, applied to sentences considered asstrings of characters (not strings of words), this for-malisation can only render an account of analogieson the level of form.
Figure 1 shows examples ofanalogies meeting the above definition.3.2 ResultsIt takes some ten days to gather all possible analo-gies of form using the above definition on a Pen-tium 4 computer at 2.8 Hz with 2 Gb memory for acorpus of around 100,000 sentences.
Of course, we7http://www.c-star.org/.8The difference in size between Japanese and the other lan-guages may be explained by the indifferent use of kanji or hi-ragana: e.g.,????
or???
/kudasai/ (please).9Some cases of analogies are not considered by this defini-tion, like reduplication: e.g., I play tennis.
: I play tennis.
Doyou play tennis too?
:: I play guitar.
: I play guitar.
Do youplay guitar too?, or mirroring: stressed : desserts :: reward :drawer.
Also, in reality, this formalisation is only an implica-tion.
But we shall use it as if it were an equivalence.10Substitutions and transpositions are not considered as basicedit operations.do not inspect all possible quadruples of sentences.Rather, a hierarchical coding of sentences based oncounts of characters allows us to infer the absenceof any analogy within large sets of sentences.
Thiscuts the computational load.
To compute edit dis-tances, a fast bit string similarity computation algo-rithm (ALLISON and DIX, 1986) is used.We counted the number of analogies of formin each of the monolingual Chinese, English andJapanese parts of the corpus using the previous for-mula.
The examples of Figure 1 are actual exam-ples of analogies retrieved.
Table 2 shows the countsfor each language.
The numbers obtained are quitelarge.
For English, we report around 2.5 millionanalogies of form involving more than 50,000 sen-tences.
That is to say, half of the sentences of thecorpus are already in immediate analogy with othersentences of the same corpus.3.3 DiscussionThe average number of analogies of form per sen-tence in each different language over all uniquesentences may be estimated in the followingway: 1, 639, 068 / 96, 234 = 17.03 for Chi-nese, 2, 384, 202 / 97, 769 = 24.39 for En-glish and 1, 910, 065 / 103, 274 = 18.50 forJapanese.
Averaging the sentences involved, thisbecomes: 5, 059, 979 / 49, 675 = 33, 00 for Chi-nese, 2, 384, 202 / 53, 250 = 44.77 for English and1, 910, 065 / 53, 572 = 35.65 for Japanese, whichindicates that, on average, there are dozens of differ-ent ways to obtain these sentences by analogy withother sentences.These counts are necessarily higher bounds of thenumbers of ?true analogies?, as they rely on formonly.
For instance, the first analogy in Figure 1 isnot a ?true analogy?.
However, it is quite difficult tospot such analogies, so that the overall impressionis that analogies of form which are not analogies ofmeaning are exceptions.
So, our next problem willbe to try to retain only those analogies which arealso analogies of meaning.4 A lower estimate: meaning preservationthrough translation4.1 MethodComputing analogies between structural represen-tations is possible11.
Unfortunately, the corpus wehave at our disposal does not offer any structuralrepresentation.
And it does not seem that toolsare yet available which would deliver semantic (notsyntactic) representations for all sentences of ourcorpus in all three languages we deal with.Fortunately, common sense has it that translationpreserves meaning12, and, by definition, a multilin-gual corpus, like the one we use, contains corre-sponding utterances in different languages.
Conse-quently, we shall assume that if two sentences A1and A2 in two different languages are translationsof one another (noted A1 ?
A2), then, they shouldbe the linguistic realisations of the same meaning,and reciprocally13.??A?

in a set of sentences in a given lan-guage, say L1, is tantamount to counting the casesdescribed by the following formula (ii).11(ITKONEN and HAUKIOJA, 1997) show how ?true analo-gies?
can be computed by relying at the same time on the sur-face and the structural representation of sentences.12See (CARL, 1998) for an attempt at classifying machinetranslation systems relying on this idea.13Note that, in this formula, L1 and L2 need not be different.If the language is the same, then, A1 and A2 are paraphrases.A1 ?

Obviously, relying on morelanguages should give a higher accuracy to themethod.
Here, we have only three languages atour disposal.
By relying on languages which aretypologically different like Chinese, English andJapanese, it is reasonable to think that we somewhatcounterbalance the small number of languages used.To summarize, by using Equivalence (i), and byconsidering only sentences attested in our corpus,Formula (ii) can be restated as follows, when re-stricted to three languages.A1 : B1 :: C1 : D1l l l lA2 : B2 :: C2 : D2l l l lA3 : B3 :: C3 : D3?
?A?
: ?B?
:: ?C?
: ?D?Practically, thus, the number of ?true analogies?
isjust the cardinal of the intersection set of the sets ofanalogies for each possible language.4.2 Results4.2.1 Pairwise intersectionOut of a total of 2,384,202 English analogies on thelevel of form, 238,135 are common with Chinese.They involve 25,554 sentences.
Consequently, 10%of the English analogies of form may be thought tobe analogies of form and meaning, i.e., ?true analo-gies?, when relying only on Chinese.Between English and Japanese the number ofanalogies in common is 336,287 (involving 24,674sentences) which represents 14% of the Englishanalogies.
An example is given in Figure 2.Between Chinese and Japanese very similar fig-ures are obtained, as the number of analogies incommon between these two languages is 329,429(involving 25,127 sentences).4.2.2 Chinese ?
English ?
JapaneseTaking the intersection of Chinese, English andJapanese leads to a figure of 68,164 ?true analo-gies?, involving 13,602 different sentences.4.3 DiscussionAlthough the number of analogies dropped from2.5 million analogies of form in English, down toless than 70,000 when intersecting with Chinese andJapanese, one cannot say that the obtained figure issmall.The average number of ?true analogies?
per sen-tence over all the corpus is: 162, 318 / 68, 184 =0.42.
In other words, in this corpus, one sentence isinvolved in about half a ?true analogy?
in average,taking it for granted that the linguistic differencesbetween Chinese, English and Japanese filter realoppositions in meaning out of the oppositions cap-tured by analogies of form.The number of sentences involved in at least oneanalogy is 13,602, so that, more than one tenth ofthe sentences of the corpus are in an immediate ana-logical relation with other sentences of the corpus.Such a figure is not negligeable.Averaging those sentences involved in at least oneanalogy gives the figure of 162, 318 / 13, 602 =11.93 ?true analogies?, which indicates that, on av-erage, there are ten different ways to obtain thesesentences by analogy with other sentences.It is questionable whether those analogies thatwere lost in the successive intersections were re-ally not analogies on the meaning level.
In fact, theimpression is that our experiment yielded a figurewhich is excessively low.
An inspection by handconvinced us that almost all analogies which werediscarded would have been considered by a humanevaluator as ?true analogies?.
Figure 1 shows twosuch examples.
The problem is that the correspond-ing translations in other languages did not make ananalogy of form.
Other ways of saying could havemade valid analogies of form.
Consequently, thelow number of translation equivalents available inour corpus is responsible of the low number of ?trueanalogies?
found by this method.5 A higher estimate: translation byenforcement of ?true analogies?5.1 MethodThe corpus we used is rather poor in translationequivalents, or paraphrases: an English sentencegets only 1.20 equivalent sentences on averagewhen translated into Chinese, and only 1.52 intoJapanese.
If we would like to get a more accurateestimate of the number of ?true analogies?
in En-glish, then our problem becomes that of increasingthe number of possible translations of English sen-tences in Chinese and in Japanese, i.e., to increasethe number of paraphrases in Chinese and Japanese.To address this problem, we adopted a viewwhich is the opposite of our previous view.
We de-cided to enforce ?true analogies?
: given an analogyof form in a first language we forced it, when pos-sible, to be reflected by an analogy of form in thesecond language.
This should yield an estimate ofthe number of analogies in common between twolanguages which, if not necessarily more accurate,will at least be a higher estimate.A1 : B1 :: C1 : D1l l lA2 : B2 :: C2 : D2?D1lD2To do so, the formula mentioned in section 3.1 isused in production, i.e., D2 is generated from thethree sentences A2, B2 and C2 when it is possible.5.2 ResultsUsing the method described above, we automati-cally produced Chinese translations for those En-glish sentences of the corpus which intervene in atleast one analogy of form.
This delivered an aver-age of 51 different candidate sentences.
As a whole,48,351 sentences among 53,250 could be translated.By doing the same for Japanese, the average num-ber of different sentences is higher: 174 for 47,702translated sentences14.
(For the reader to judge, Fig-ure 3 shows examples of Japanese-to-English trans-lations, rather than English-to-Japanese.
)The obtained translations were added to the cor-pus so as to increase the number of paraphrases inChinese and Japanese.
Then all counts were redone,and the new figures are listed under the title ?Higherestimate?
in Table 2.5.3 DiscussionThe new figure of 1,507,380 analogies for 49,052sentences involved should be compared with theprevious figures for the lower estimate.
It is muchhigher, but it seems closer to the impression one getswhen screening the analogies: analogies of formwhich are not analogies of meaning are very rare.However, the sentences that were obtained by en-forcing analogies and then included in the corpus,are not always valid sentences.
Figure 3 showssome such examples.14Here again, we suspect the cause of the difference to be theindifferent use of kanji and hiragana.Future works should thus consider the problemof filtering in some ways the translations obtainedautomatically using, for example, N-gram statisticalmodels.
After such a filtering, new counts should beperformed again.
However, the problem with sucha filtering is that it may lose the morphological pro-ductivity of analogy.6 ConclusionIn this paper, we reported experiments of countingthe number of ?true analogies,?
i.e., analogies ofform and meaning, between sentences contained ina large multilingual corpus, making the assumptionthat translation preserves meaning.
We computed alower and a higher estimates.Using an English corpus of almost 100,000 dif-ferent sentences, we obtained a lower estimate ofalmost 70,000 ?true analogies?
involving almost14,000 sentences by intersecting analogies of formbetween Chinese, English and Japanese.A higher estimate was obtained by enforcinganalogies of form, i.e., generating new sentences tofulfil analogies of form, so as to increase the num-ber of paraphrases.
More than a million and a half?true analogies?
were found.
They involve almost50,000 sentences, i.e., half of the sentences of thecorpus.
This meets our impression that almost allanalogies of form between the English sentences ofour corpus are also analogies of meaning.Although we do not claim that analogy can ex-plain everything about language, this work showsthat, even when considering the lower estimate ob-tained, the number of ?true analogies?
that can befound in a corpus is far from being negligeable.
Fur-ther research should focus on the way analogies aredistributed over sentences, i.e., on the characterisa-tion of sentences involved in analogies.Finally, as a speculative remark, similar count-ings as the ones reported above could contribute tothe debate about ?the argument from the poverty ofthe stimulus?
