Proceedings of the 8th Workshop on Asian Language Resources, pages 56?63,Beijing, China, 21-22 August 2010. c?2010 Asian Federation for Natural Language ProcessingSentiWordNet for Indian LanguagesAmitava Das1 and Sivaji Bandyopadhyay2Department of Computer Science and EngineeringJadavpur Universityamitava.santu@gmail.com1 sivaji_cse_ju@yahoo.com2AbstractThe discipline where sentiment/ opi-nion/ emotion has been identified andclassified in human written text is wellknown as sentiment analysis.
A typicalcomputational approach to sentimentanalysis starts with prior polarity lex-icons where entries are tagged withtheir prior out of context polarity ashuman beings perceive using theircognitive knowledge.
Till date, all re-search efforts found in sentiment lex-icon literature deal mostly with Englishtexts.
In this article, we propose mul-tiple computational techniques like,WordNet based, dictionary based, cor-pus based or generative approaches forgenerating SentiWordNet(s) for Indianlanguages.
Currently, SentiWordNet(s)are being developed for three Indianlanguages: Bengali, Hindi and Telugu.An online intuitive game has been de-veloped to create and validate the de-veloped SentiWordNet(s) by involvingInternet population.
A number of au-tomatic, semi-automatic and manualvalidations and evaluation methodolo-gies have been adopted to measure thecoverage and credibility of the devel-oped SentiWordNet(s).1 IntroductionSentiment analysis and classification fromelectronic text is a hard semantic disambigua-tion problem.
The regulating aspects of seman-tic orientation of a text are natural languagecontext information (Pang et al, 2002) lan-guage properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006),domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Ga-mon, 2005) and lastly most challenging is thetime dimension (Read, 2005).The following example shows that the polar-ity tag associated with a sentiment word de-pends on the time dimension.
During 90?s mo-bile phone users generally reported in variousonline reviews about their color phones but inrecent times color phone is not just enough.People are fascinated and influenced by touchscreen and various software(s) installation fa-cilities on these new generation gadgets.In typical computational approaches (Higa-shinaka et al, 2007; Hatzivassiloglou et al,2000) to sentiment analysis researchers con-sider the problem of learning a dictionary thatmaps semantic representations to verbaliza-tions, where the data comes from opinionatedelectronic text.
Although lexicons in these dic-tionaries are not explicitly marked up with re-spect to their contextual semantics, they con-tain only explicit polarity rating and aspectindicators.
Lexicon-based approaches can bebroadly classified into two categories firstlywhere the discriminative polarity tag of lex-icons is determined on labeled training dataand secondly where the lexicons are manuallycompiled, the later constitutes the main effec-tive approach.It is undoubted that the manual compilationis always the best way to create monolingualsemantic lexicons, but manual methods areexpensive in terms of human resources, it in-volves a substantial number of human annota-tors and it takes lot of time as well.
In this pa-per we propose several computational tech-niques to generate sentiment lexicons in Indianlanguages automatically and semi-automatically.
In the present task, SentiWord-56Net(s) are being developed for the Bengali,Hindi and Telugu languages.Several prior polarity sentiment lexicons areavailable for English such as SentiWordNet(Esuli et.
al., 2006), Subjectivity Word List(Wilson et.
al., 2005), WordNet Affect list(Strapparava et al, 2004), Taboada?s adjectivelist (Taboada et al, 2006).Among these publicly available sentimentlexicon resources we find that SentiWordNet ismost widely used (number of citation is higherthan other resources1) in several applicationssuch as sentiment analysis, opinion mining andemotion analysis.
Subjectivity Word List ismost trustable as the opinion mining systemOpinionFinder2 that uses the subjectivity wordlist has reported highest score for opi-nion/sentiment subjectivity (Wiebe and Riloff,2006).
SentiWordNet is an automatically con-structed lexical resource for English that as-signs a positivity score and a negativity scoreto each WordNet synset.The subjectivity word list is compiled frommanually developed resources augmented withentries learned from corpora.
The entries in thesubjectivity word list have been labeled withpart of speech (POS) tags as well as eitherstrong or weak subjective tag depending on thereliability of the subjective nature of the entry.These two resources have been merged au-tomatically and the merged resource is used forSentiWordNet(s) generation in the presenttask.The generated sentiment lexicons or Senti-WordNet(s) for several Indian languages most-ly contain synsets (approximately 60%) of re-spective languages.
Synset based method isrobust for any kind of monolingual lexiconcreation and useful to avoid further word sensedisambiguation problem in application domain.Additionally we have developed an onlineintuitive game to create and validate the devel-oped SentiWordNet(s) by involving Internetpopulation.The proposed approaches in this paper areeasy to adopt for any new language.
To meas-ure the coverage and credibility of generatedSentiWordNet(s) in Indian languages we have1http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/2http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa/developed several automatic and semi-automatic evaluation methods.2 Related WorksVarious methods have been used in the litera-ture such as WordNet based, dictionary based,corpus based or generative approaches for sen-timent lexicon generation in a new target lan-guage.Andreevskaia and Bergler, (2006) present amethod for extracting sentiment-bearing adjec-tives from WordNet using the Sentiment TagExtraction Program (STEP).
They did 58STEP runs on unique non-intersecting seedlists drawn from manually annotated list ofpositive and negative adjectives and evaluatedthe results against other manually annotatedlists.The proposed methods in (Wiebe and Riloff,2006) automatically generate resources forsubjectivity analysis for a new target languagefrom the available resources for English.
Twotechniques have been proposed for the genera-tion of target language lexicon from Englishsubjectivity lexicon.
The first technique uses abilingual dictionary while the second methodis a parallel corpus based approach using exist-ing subjectivity analysis tools for English.Automatically or manually created lexiconsmay have limited coverage and do not includemost semantically contrasting word pairs likeantonyms.
Antonyms are broadly categorized(Saif Mohammed, 2008) as gradable adjec-tives (hot?cold, good?bad, friend?enemy) andproductive adjectives (normal?abnormal, for-tune?misfortune, implicit?explicit).
The firsttype contains the semantically contrastingword pairs but the second type includes ortho-graphic suffix/affix as a clue.
The second typeis highly productive using very less number ofaffixation rules.Degree of antonymy (Mohammad et al,2008) is defined to encompass the completesemantic range as a combined measure of thecontrast in meaning conveyed by two antony-my words and is identified by distributionalhypothesis.
It helps to measure relative senti-ment score of a word and its antonym.Kumaran et al, (2008) introduced a beauti-ful method for automatic data creation by on-line intuitive games.
A methodology has been57proposed for community creation of linguisticdata by community collaborative frameworkknown as wikiBABEL3.
It may be described asa revolutionary approach to automaticallycreate large credible linguistic data by involv-ing Internet population for content creation.For the present task we prefer to involve allthe available methodologies to automaticallyand semi-automatically create and validateSentiWordNet(s) for three Indian languages.Automatic methods involve only computation-al methods.
Semi-automatic methods involvehuman interruption to validate system?s output.3 Source Lexicon AcquisitionSentiWordNet and Subjectivity Word Listhave been identified as the most reliable sourcelexicons.
The first one is widely used and thesecond one is robust in terms of performance.A merged sentiment lexicon has been devel-oped from both the resources by removing theduplicates.
It has been observed that 64% ofthe single word entries are common in the Sub-jectivity Word List and SentiWordNet.
Thenew merged sentiment lexicon consists of14,135 numbers of tokens.
Several filteringtechniques have been applied to generate thenew list.A subset of 8,427 sentiment words has beenextracted from the English SentiWordNet, byselecting those whose orientation strength isabove the heuristically identified thresholdvalue of 0.4.
The words whose orientationstrength is below 0.4 are ambiguous and maylose their subjectivity in the target languageafter translation.
A total of weakly subjective2652 words are discarded from theSubjectivity word list as proposed in (Wiebeand Riloff, 2006).In the next stage the words whose POScategory in the Subjectivity word list isundefined and tagged as ?anypos?
areconsidered.
These words may generate senseambiguity issues in the next stages ofsubjectivity detection.
The words are checkedin the SentiWordNet list for validation.
If amatch is found with certain POS category, theword is added to the new merged sentiment3http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/wikibabel/lexicon.
Otherwise the word is discarded toavoid ambiguities later.Some words in the Subjectivity word list areinflected e.g., memories.
These words wouldbe stemmed during the translation process, butsome words present no subjectivity propertyafter stemming (memory has no subjectivityproperty).
A word may occur in thesubjectivity list in many inflected forms.Individual clusters for the words sharing thesame root form are created and then checked inthe SentiWordNet for validation.
If the rootword exists in the SentiWordNet then it isassumed that the word remains subjective afterstemming and hence is added to the new list.Otherwise the cluster is completely discardedto avoid any further ambiguities.Various statistics of the English Senti-WordNet and Subjectivity Word List are re-ported in Table 1.SentiWordNet Subjectivity Word ListEntries Single Multi Single Multi115424 79091 5866 990Uambi-guousWords20789 30000 4745 963DiscardedAm-biguousWords Threshold Orientation  StrengthSubjectivityStrength POS86944 30000 2652 928Table 1: English SentiWordNet and Subjec-tivity Word List Statistics4 Target Lexicon Generation4.1 Bilingual Dictionary Based ApproachA word-level translation process followed byerror reduction technique has been adopted forgenerating the Indian languagesSentiWordNet(s) from the English sentimentlexicon merged from the EnglishSentiWordNet and the Subjectivity Word List.English to Indian languages synsets are be-ing developed under Project English to IndianLanguages Machine Translation Systems58(EILMT)4, a consortia project funded by De-partment of Information Technology (DIT),Government of India.
These synsets are robustand reliable as these are created by nativespeakers as well as linguistics experts of thespecific languages.
For each language we haveapproximately 9966 synsets along with theEnglish WordNet offset.
These bilingual syn-set dictionaries have been used along with lan-guage specific dictionaries.A word level synset/lexical transfer tech-nique is applied to each English synset/word inthe merged sentiment lexicon.
Each dictionarysearch produces a set of Indian languages syn-sets/words for a particular English synset/word.4.1.1 HindiTwo available manually compiled English-Hindi electronic dictionaries have been identi-fied for the present task.
First is the SHABD-KOSH5  and the second one is Shabdanjali6 .These two dictionaries have been merged au-tomatically by replacing the duplicates.
Themerged English-Hindi dictionary contains ap-proximately 90,872 unique entries.
The posi-tive and negative sentiment scores for the Hin-di words are copied from their English Senti-WordNet.The bilingual dictionary based translationprocess has resulted 22,708 Hindi entries.4.1.2 BengaliAn English-Bengali dictionary (approx-imately 102119 entries) has been developedusing the Samsad Bengali-English dictionary7.The positive and negative sentiment scores forthe Bengali words are copied from their Eng-lish SentiWordNet equivalents.The bilingual dictionary based translationprocess has resulted in 35,805 Bengali entries.A manual checking is done to identify the re-liability of the words generated from automaticprocess.
After manual checking only 16884http://www.cdacmumbai.in/e-ilmt5http://www.shabdkosh.com/6http://www.shabdkosh.com/content/category/downloads/7http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/biswas_bengali/words are discarded i.e., the final list consistsof 34,117 words.4.2 TeluguCharles Philip Brown English-Telugu Dictio-nary 8 , Aksharamala 9  English-Telugu Dictio-nary and English-Telugu Dictionary 10  devel-oped by Language Technology Research Cen-ter (LTRC), International Institute of Hydera-bad (IITH) have been chosen for the presenttask.
There is no WordNet publicly availablefor Telugu and the corpus (Section 4.5) weused is small in size.
Dictionary based ap-proach is the main process for Telugu Senti-WordNet generation.These three dictionaries have been mergedautomatically by replacing the duplicates.
Themerged English-Telugu dictionary containsapproximately 112310 unique entries.
The pos-itive and negative sentiment scores for the Te-lugu words are copied from their English Sen-tiWordNet equivalents.The dictionary based translation process hasresulted in 30,889 Telugu entries, about 88%of final Telugu SentiWordNet synsets.
An on-line intuitive game has been proposed in Sec-tion 4.6 to automatically validate the devel-oped Telugu SentiWordNet by involving In-ternet population.4.3 WordNet Based ApproachWordNet(s) are available for Hindi11  (Jha etal., 2001) and Bengali12 (Robkop et al, 2010)but publicly unavailable for Telugu.A WordNet based lexicon expansion strate-gy has been adopted to increase the coverageof the generated SentiWordNet(s) through thedictionary based approach.
The present algo-rithm starts with English SentiWordNet syn-sets that is expanded using synonymy and an-tonymy relations in the WordNet.
For match-ing synsets we keep the exact score as in thesource synset in the English SentiWordNet.The calculated positivity and negativity score8http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/brown/9https://groups.google.com/group/aksharamala10http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/onlineServices/Dictionaries/Dict_Frame.html11http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/wordnet/webhwn/12http://bn.asianwordnet.org/59for any target language antonym synset is cal-culated as:11p pn nT ST S= ?= ?where pS , nS  are the positivity and negativ-ity score for the source language (i.e, English)and pT , nT  are the positivity and negativityscore for target languages (i.e., Hindi and Ben-gali) respectively.4.3.1 HindiHindi WordNet is a well structured and ma-nually compiled resource and is being updatedsince last nine years.
There is an availableAPI13  for accessing the Hindi WordNet.
Al-most 60% of final SentiWordNet synsets inHindi are generated by this method.4.3.2 BengaliThe Bengali WordNet is being developed bythe Asian WordNet (AWN) community.
It on-ly contains 1775 noun synsets as reported in(Robkop et al, 2010).
A Web Service14  hasbeen provided for accessing the BengaliWordNet.
There are only a few number ofnoun synsets in the Bengali WordNet and otherimportant POS category words for sentimentlexicon such as adjective, adverb and verb areabsent.
Only 5% new lexicon entries have beengenerated in this process.4.4 Antonym GenerationAutomatically or manually created lexiconshave limited coverage and do not include mostsemantically contrasting word pairs.
To over-come the limitation and increase the coverageof the SentiWordNet(s) we present automaticantonymy generation technique followed bycorpus validation to check orthographicallygenerated antonym does really exist.
Only 16hand crafted rules have been used as reportedin Table 2.
About 8% of Bengali, 7% of Hindiand 11% of Telugu SentiWordNet entries aregenerated in this process.13http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/wordnet/webhwn/API_downloaderInfo.php14http://bn.asianwordnet.org/servicesAffix/Suffix Word AntonymabX  Normal  Ab-normalmisX Fortune Mis-fortuneimX-exX  Im-plicit Ex-plicitantiX Clockwise Anti-clockwisenonX  Aligned Non-alignedinX-exX  In-trovert Ex-trovertdisX Interest Dis-interestunX  Biased Un-biasedupX-downX  Up-hill Down-hillimX  Possible Im-possibleillX  Legal Il-legaloverX-underX  Overdone Under-doneinX  Consistent In-consistentrX-irX  Regular Ir-regularXless-Xful  Harm-less Harm-fulmalX  Function Mal-functionTable 2: Rules for Generating Productive An-tonyms4.5 Corpus Based ApproachLanguage/culture specific words such as thoselisted below are to be captured in the devel-oped SentiWordNet(s).
But sentiment lexicongeneration techniques via cross-lingual projec-tion are unable to capture these words.
As ex-ample:?????
(Sahera: A marriage-wear) (Durgapujo: A festiv-al of Bengal)To increase the coverage of the developedSentiWordNet(s) and to capture the lan-guage/culture specific words an automatic cor-pus based approach has been proposed.
At thisstage the developed SentiWordNet(s) for thethree Indian languages have been used as aseed list.
Language specific corpus is automat-ically tagged with these seed words and wehave a simple tagset as SWP (Sentiment WordPositive) and SWN (Sentiment Word Nega-tive).
Although we have both positivity andnegativity scores for the words in the seed listbut we prefer a word level tag as either posi-tive or negative following the highest senti-ment score.A Conditional Random Field (CRF15) basedMachine Learning model is then trained withthe seed list corpus along with multiple lin-guistics features such as morpheme, parts-of-15http://crfpp.sourceforge.net60speech, and chunk label.
These linguistics fea-tures have been extracted by the shallow pars-ers16  for Indian languages.
An n-gram (n=4)sequence labeling model has been used for thepresent task.The monolingual corpuses used have beendeveloped under Project English to IndianLanguages Machine Translation Systems(EILMT).
Each corpus has approximately 10Kof sentences.4.6 Gaming MethodologyThere are several motivations behind develop-ing an intuitive game to automatically createmultilingual SentiWordNet(s).
The assignedpolarity scores to each synset may vary in timedimension.
Language specific polarity scoresmay vary and it should be authenticated bynumbers of language specific annotators.In the history of Information Retrieval re-search there is a milestone when ESP17 game(Ahn et al, 2004) innovate the concept of agame to automatically label images availablein World Wide Web.
Highly motivated by thehistorical research we proposed a intuitivegame to create and validate SentiWordNet(s)for Indian languages by involving internetpopulation.Figure 1: Intuitive Game for SentiWordNet(s)CreationIn the gaming interface a simple picture (re-trieved by Google Image API18) along with asentiment bearing word (retrieved randomly16http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/showfile.php?filename=downloads/shallow_parser.php17http://www.espgame.org/18http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/multimedia.htmlfrom SentiWordNet) is displayed to a playerand he/she is then been asked to capture hisimmediate sentiment as extreme positive, posi-tive, extreme negative, negative or neutral bypressing appropriate emoticon buttons.
A snapof the game is shown in the Figure 1.
The sen-timent score is calculated by the different emo-ticons based on the inputs from the differentplayers and then is assigned the scale as fol-lows: extreme positive (pos: 0.5, neg: 0.0),positive (pos: 0.25, neg: 0.0), neutral (pos: 0.0,neg: 0.0), negative (pos: 0.0, 0.25), extremenegative (pos: 0.0, neg: 0.5).The score of a particular player is calculatedon the basis of pre-stored sentiment lexiconscores in the generated SentiWordNet(s).5 EvaluationAndera Esuli and Fabrizio Sebastiani (2006)have calculated the reliability of the sentimentscores attached to every synsets in the EnglishSentiWordNet.
They have tagged sentimentwords in the English WordNet with positiveand negative sentiment scores.
In the presenttask, these sentiment scores from EnglishWordNet have been directly copied to the In-dian language SentiWordNet(s).Two extrinsic evaluation strategies havebeen adopted for the developed Bengali Sen-tiWordNet based on the two main usages ofthe sentiment lexicon as subjectivity classifierand polarity identifier.
The Hindi and TeluguSentiWordNet(s) have not completely beenevaluated.5.1 CoverageNEWS BLOGTotal number of  documents 100 -Total number of sentences 2234 300Avgerage number of sentences ina document 22 -Total number of wordforms 28807 4675Avgerage number of wordformsin a document 288 -Total number of distinctwordforms 17176 1235Table 3: Bengali Corpus StatisticsWe experimented with NEWS and BLOGcorpora for subjectivity detection.
Sentimentlexicons are generally domain independent butit provides a good baseline while working withsentiment analysis systems.
The coverage of61the developed Bengali SentiWordNet is eva-luated by using it in a subjectivity classifier(Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2009).
The statisticsof the NEWS and BLOG corpora is reported inTable 3.For comparison with the coverage of Eng-lish SentiWordNet the same subjectivity clas-sifier (Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2009) hasbeen applied on Multi Perspective QuestionAnswering (MPQA) (NEWS) and IMDB Mov-ie review corpus along with English Senti-WordNet.
The result of the subjectivity clas-sifier on both the corpus proves that the cover-age of the Bengali SentiWordNet is reasonablygood.
The subjectivity word list used in thesubjectivity classifier is developed from theIMDB corpus and hence the experiments onthe IMDB corpus have yielded high precisionand recall scores.
The developed Bengali Sen-tiWordNet is domain independent and still itscoverage is very good as shown in Table 4.Languages Domain Precision RecallEnglish MPQA 76.08% 83.33%IMDB 79.90% 86.55%Bengali NEWS 72.16% 76.00% BLOG 74.6% 80.4%Table 4: Subjectivity Classifier using Senti-WordNet5.2 Polarity ScoresThis evaluation metric measures the reliabilityof the associated polarity scores in the senti-ment lexicons.
To measure the reliability ofpolarity scores in the developed Bengali Sen-tiWordNet, a polarity classifier (Das and Ban-dyopadhyay, 2010) has been developed usingthe Bengali SentiWordNet alng with someother linguistic features.Features Overall Performance Incremented BySentiWordNet 47.60%Table 5: Polarity Performance Using BengaliSentiWordNetFeature ablation method proves that the as-sociated polarity scores in the developed Ben-gali SentiWordNet are reliable.
Table 5 showsthe performance of a polarity classifier usingthe Bengali SentiWordNet.

Two persons are asked to manuallycheck it and the result is reported in Table 7.The coverage of the Hindi SentiWordNet hasnot been evaluated, as no manually annotatedsentiment corpus is available.Polarity Positive NegativePercentage 88.0% 91.0%Table 7: Evaluation of Polarity Score of De-veloped Hindi SentiWordNetFor Telugu we created a version of the gamewith Telugu words on screen.
Only 3 usershave played the Telugu language specificgame till date.
Total 92 arbitrary words havebeen tagged and the accuracy of the polarityscores is reported in Table 8.

Thegame based technique may be directed towardsa new way for the creation of linguistic datanot just only for SentiWordNet(s) but in eitherareas of NLP too.Presently only the Bengali SentiWordNet19is downloadable from the author?s web page.19http://www.amitavadas.com/sentiwordnet.php62ReferencesAndreevskaia Alina and Bergler Sabine.
