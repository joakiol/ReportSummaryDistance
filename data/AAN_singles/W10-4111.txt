usagesrecognition based on the previouswork, this paper has studied auto-matically recognizing common Chi-nese adverbs?
usages using statisticalmethods.
Three statistical models, viz.CRF, ME, and SVM, are used to la-bel several common Chinese ad-verbs?
usages on the segmentationand part-of-speech tagged corpus ofPeople?s Daily(Jan 1998).
The ex-periment results show that statistical-based method is effective in auto-matically recognizing of severalcommon adverbs?
usages and hasgood application prospects.1 IntroductionChinese vocabulary can be divided into func-tional words and notional words.
In  the fieldof Natural Language Processing(NLP), manystudies on text computing or word meaningunderstanding are focused on the notionalwords, rarely involving functional words.Especially in some common NLP applicationfields, such as text summarization, text clas-sification, information retrieval, and so on,the researchers mainly take notional words asfeatures, and list some functional word asstop words without considering their influ-ence on text meaning.
This will impact thedeep analysis of text semantic, especailly forchinese, and become the bottleneck of ma-chine understanding on text content, and im-pede further improving the performance ofapplication systems.
Due to Chinese lackingmorphological changes(Li X., 2005), Chi-nese functional words undertake the gram-matical functions and grammatical meanings,and in other language these functions aremainly undertaken by morphologicalchanges.
So, functional words play an moreimportant role in Chinese semantic under-standing and grammatical analysis.
Thestudy on functional words of modern Chi-nese semantic in Chinese text processing andunderstanding has great significance.Yu(Yu S., 2004), Liu(Liu, Y., 2004), et alhave defined the generalized functionalwords as adverbs, conjunctions, prepositions,modal particles, auxiliary, and localizerwords.
From the statistic, the number ofmodern Chinese adverbs is about 1000 withthe broad definition standard.
Compared withother fuctional words, the adverbs number ismuch larger.
The function and usages ofmodern Chinese adverbs vary widely fromeach other, especially some common adverbs.Therefore for modern Chinese text under-standing, adverbs are the important text fea-tures which can not be neglected.
For themodern Chinese adverbs, only using thesegmentation and part-of-speech tagging in-formation for Chinese text automatic proc-essing and understanding is not enough.
So,particular study on the usage of adverbs intexts comprehensive is indispensable, and theautomatic identification of adverbs?
usage insome extend is of great significance.2 Related ResearchesThe work of automatically recognizing us-ages of adverbs of modern Chinese is part ofthe NLP-oriented research of Modern Chi-nese Functional Words Knowledge Base.
Yuet al proposed the idea of building the ?Trin-ity?
knowledge-base of generalized func-tional words(Yu, S., 2004), and defined thegeneralized functional words as adverbs,conjunctions, prepositions, modal particles,auxiliary, and localizer words(Yu, S.,2004)(Liu, Y., 2004).
Zan et al describedadverb?s usages using formal rules(Zan, H.,2007a), and initially built the machine-oriented modern Chinese adverb dictionaryand the usage rule base(Zan, H., 2007b),.Hao et al imported the dictionary and rulebase(Hao, L., 2007).
Based on the previouswork, Liu et al realized an automaticallyrule-based recognizing system and got preci-sion at 74.89%(Liu, R., 2008).The rule-based method has the advantageof simple, intuitive, strong pertinence, etc,but it also has the shortcomings of lowercoverage, and it is difficult to be further op-timized or generalized.
For example, thereare some adverbs which different usages aredifficult to describe using formal rules, suchas:?1???????????????
[(1)It is Sunday, you can sleep in atwill.]?2????????????????????????
[(2)They were always talking while lis-tensing report, so they catched nothingof the report content.
]In the adverb usage dictionary, the adverb?jinguan?
?/ ?
has two meanings:<d_jin3guan3_1> and <d_jin3guan3_2>.The meaning of ?jinguan?
?/ ?
in sentence(1) is belong to <d_jin3guan3_1>, it meansthe action or behavior can be without anylimitations; the meaning of ?jinguan?
?/ ?in sentence (2) is belong to <d_jin3guan3_2>,it means the action or behavior is continu-ously.
This two meanings are very easy todistinguish manually, but they are hard toidentify automatically.
The two meanings?discrimination cannot accurately describeusing formal rules.Moreover, the rule-based method also ex-ists some other problem, for example, someadverbs?
usages require modifying verbphrase, or clauses, or used in imperative, andso on.
These problems need deep syntacticeven semantic knowledge to solve.
But thisis lack in the segmentation and part-of-speech tagging corpus.
So, the rule-basedmethod will be unable to identify the ad-verbs?
usages in such situations.To solve the problems of the existing rule-based method of adverbs?
usages recognition,based on the foundation of the previous work,this article considers using statistical methodto recognize adverbs?
usages automatically.This method can be continuously optimizedaccording to actual training data and lan-guage model, it will avoid the limitations ofrule-based method.3 Studies on Automatic Recognitionof Adverbs?
Usages Based on Sta-tistical methodsIn NLP, the research can be divided intothree questions: point, sequence, and struc-ture(Vapnik V., 1998).
For the Chinese ad-verbs?
usages recognition task, it can betaken as a point question which classify thecontext of adverbs, and also can be taken as asequence question which recognize the ad-verb sequence in the sentence.
So, we choosethree statistical models: Conditional RandomFields(CRF), Maximum Entropy(ME), andSupport Vector Machine(SVM), which havegood performance and used widely in thefield of machine learning.
CRF and MEmodel can be used in sequence tagging, andSVM is a better statistical models in catego-ries.3.1 Statistical modelsCRF is advanced by J. Lafferty(Lafferty J.,2001).
It is one of the undirected graph mod-els.
Given input sequence correspondingconditional probability of label sequence,this model?s training target is to find themaximum of conditional probability.
It hasbeen widely used in the field of NLP, such asChinese Word Segmentation(Miao X., 2007),Named Entity Recognition(Chen W.,2006)(Shi S., 2006)(Guo J., 2007)(Zhang J.,2006), Syntactic Analysis(Fei Sha, 2003),and so on.ME has been widely used for classifica-tion problem.
The basic idea of ME is to digthe potential constraint conditions in theknown event sets, and then choose a modelwhich must satisfy the known constraintconditions, while possibly let the unknownevent uniform distribution.
In the NLP appli-cations, the language model based ME doesnot dependent on domain knowledge, and isindependent of the specific task.
It has beenuse in many key fields of NLP, and hasachieved good results in Named Entity Rec-ognition(Wang J., 2005), POS tag-ging(Zhang L., 2008), Chunking Analy-sis?Li S., 2003?, Text Emotional Tenden-cies Classification(Liu, K. 2008).SVM is a statiscal machine learningmethod and has good performance in classi-fication(Vapnik V., 1998).
In NLP, SVM iswidely used in Phrases recognition(Li, G.,2005), Word Sense Disambiguation(Yu, K.,2005)(Lu, Z., 2006), Text classification, andso on.
SVM has good generalization ability,and can well classify the data in the trainingsample limited circumstances.
To the usagerecognition of adverbs, the available data islimited, so using SVM may be good.CRF, ME and SVM are the outstandingstatistical models in machine learning.
CRFcan well consider the mutual influence be-tween usage marks, and overcomes the prob-lem of marker offset.
This is good for somerare usage recognition of adverb.
The lan-guage model built by ME method is inde-pendent to specific tasks, and domain knowl-edge.
ME can effectively use context infor-mation, and comprehensively evaluate thevarious characteristics.
SVM has good gen-eralization ability, and can well classify thedata in the training sample limited circum-stances.
The advantages of these models arebeneficial to recognize adverbs?
usages cor-rectly.In this paper, we use CRF++1, the MEtoolkit maxent2of Zhang Le, and LibSVM3toolkit as the automatic tagging tool in ourexperiments.3.2 Feature Selection of ModelsLinguists Firth once said ?You shall know aword by the company it keeps?
(Firth, 1957).This refers to the mean of a word can only be1CRF++: Yet Another Toolkit[CP/OL].http://www.chasen.org/~taku/software/CRF++2http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0450736/maxent_toolkit.html3http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmjudged and identified from the words associ-ated with it.
To the adverbs?
usage recogni-tion, it also needs to get the word?s usageknowledge from the contexts.
Through ana-lyzing some examples, we found that wordsand part of speech in the contexts are usefulto identify adverbs?
usages.
Therefore, in ourexperiment, to CRF and ME model, we se-lect 3 template features as table 1.
The valueof n can take 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.Table 1 Feature TemplateID MeaningsT1 words, within the destined context windownT2 the part of speech, within the destined con-text window nT3 the words + part of speech + the combina-tion of both, within the destined contextwindow nIn the SVM experiment, the feature is nu-meric characteristics.
To the adverb in thesentence, through selecting the window sizeof the context, and then calculating the mu-tual information(MI) of the features in thewindow and the adverb, the result of MI asfeature vector.
The MI between word w andword u can be calculated as follows,pppI21*log=(1)Where:p1: the frequency of u in the corpusp2: the frequency of t in the corpusp: the co-occurrence frequency of w and u4 Experiments and Results Analysis4.1 Experimental CorpusThe experimental data is the segmentationand part-of-speech tagged corpus of People'sDaily(Jan 1998).
First, we use the rule-basedmethod(Liu, R., 2008) to tag the adverbs?usages in the experimental data.
Then, wemanually check the tagging results and gethe standard corpus for experiment data.
Ob-serving the experiment data, the usage distri-bution of many adverbs?
is very imbalance.Some adverbs have hardly appeared, andsome usages of some adverbs have hardlyappeared.
If we choose this kind of adverbsfor statistical experiment, it will bring greateffect to the experiment results.
Therefore,after analyzing the corpus, we consider tochoose seven common Chinese adverbswhich usage distribution is somewhat bal-anced in the corpus as the object of statisticallearning.4.2 Performance EvaluationIn the experiment, we use the precision(P) asthe evaluation measure of the experimentalresults.
To the word W and its usage i, wedefine P as followed:iusageofnumbertagtheiusageofnumbertagcorrecttheP =(2)4.3 Analysis of Experimental ResultsIn order to verify the performance of models,to every adverb, we use 4 fold cross-validation experiments.
The results are theaverage results of cross-validation.Experiment 1: Performance comparison ex-periment of Statistical methods and rulemethodAiming at the different statistical models,by selecting different feature, we did 3groups experimental separately.
For CRF andME, we select T1 while n=2.
To SVM wetake MI as feature while the window size is 2.Results are shown in Table 2.Table 2 The experiment result of rule-basedmethod and the statistic-based methodMethodAdverbRule-basedCRF ME SVMbian/?

The average precisionhas been raised from 55% to 88.5%.
It canclearly be seen that the statistical method hasbetter adaptability and good applicationprospect in automatic identification of mod-ern Chinese adverbs?
usages.At the same time, we can see that the sta-tistical result of adverb ?xian ?
?hou/ ?
isobviously lower than the rule-based method.This is because the different usage of it canbe easily distinguished from its rule, so theprecision of rule-based method is higher thanstatistic-based method.
To these words, weconsider to use the method that combines thestatistics-based and rules-based method.Experiment 2: Statistical experiment underdifferent feature templateBy choosing different feature templates,this experiment to analyze the influence ofdifferent feature to the statistical method.Figure 1 is the average results of 6 ad-verbs(removing adverb ?
?
?xian hou/ ?
)using three models.
The abscissa 1-6 is thefeature in the template T1 while n take 2, 3, 4,5, 6, 7 separately.
Figure 2 is the averageresults of these adverbs using CRF and MEwith template T1, T2, and T3(see Table 1).The abscissa 1-3, 4-6, 7-9 ,10-12, 13-15, 16-18, is T1, T2, T3 while n take 2, 3 ,4 ,5, 6, 7.From Figure 1 and Figure 2, we can seethat the precision of statistical results havenot great changes by choosing different con-text window.
In general it can be achievedthe best result within the window size (-4, +4)of the context.
So, in the current scale ofcorpus, big window size may be not betterwhen recognizing usages of adverbs, and itmay bring more noise for recognizing withthe increase of window size.
But observingexperimental results of specific words, wefound that it?s not all of the words exist thisphenomenon.
Figure 3 and Figure 4 is theresult of adverb ?
?jiu/ ?
and ?
?bian/ ?
usingthree models with T1(n=2,?,7).From Figure 3 and Figure 4, we can seethat to different adverbs, the results of threemodels are not same, and even have big dif-ference.
To adverb ?
?jiu/ ?, CRF is the best,SVM is the worst.
To adverb ?bian/?
?,SVM is the best, and the difference betweenCRF and ME is not very large.
(Ma Z., 2004)also pointed out that every adverb needs tobe synthetically analyzed and researched.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.911 2 3 4 5 6??????

For some common Chineseadverb, it?s very important to study and con-trast case-by-case.5 ConclusionsThe article makes a preliminary study onautomatically recognizing common adverbs?usages.
From the experimental results wencan see, compared with the rule-basedmethod, statistic-based method has obviousadvantages.This article is a continuation of the workof Functional Word Knowledge Base.
Fur-thermore, we will study the method thatcombines the rule-based method and thestatistic-based method to automatically rec-ognizing adverbs?
usages, and further en-hance the recognition precision.
We hopeour study can help the Chinese lexical se-mantic analysis, and make a good base tothe Chinese text machine understanding andthe application of natural language process-ing.AcknowledgementThe work in this paper was supported by theChina National Natural Science Foundation(No.
