i Franque`s 1, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.albert.diaz@ub.eduAbstractWe study the correlations in the connec-tivity patterns of large scale syntactic de-pendency networks.
These networks areinduced from treebanks: their vertices de-note word forms which occur as nucleiof dependency trees.
Their edges con-nect pairs of vertices if at least two in-stance nuclei of these vertices are linkedin the dependency structure of a sentence.We examine the syntactic dependency net-works of seven languages.
In all thesecases, we consistently obtain three find-ings.
Firstly, clustering, i.e., the probabil-ity that two vertices which are linked toa common vertex are linked on their part,is much higher than expected by chance.Secondly, the mean clustering of verticesdecreases with their degree ?
this find-ing suggests the presence of a hierarchicalnetwork organization.
Thirdly, the meandegree of the nearest neighbors of a ver-tex x tends to decrease as the degree ofx grows ?
this finding indicates disassor-tative mixing in the sense that links tendto connect vertices of dissimilar degrees.Our results indicate the existence of com-mon patterns in the large scale organiza-tion of syntactic dependency networks.1 IntroductionDuring the last decade, the study of the statisti-cal properties of networks as different as technical,biological and social networks has grown tremen-dously.
See (Baraba?si and Albert, 2002; Dorogovt-sev and Mendes, 2002; Newman, 2003) for a review.Among themmany kinds of linguistic networks havebeen studied: e.g., free word association networks(Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005), syllable networks(Soares et al, 2005), thesaurus networks (Sigman65and Cecchi, 2002), and document networks (Mehler,2006).
See (Mehler, 2007a) for a review of linguis-tic network studies.
Here we focus on the so calledglobal syntactic dependency networks (GSDN) (Fer-rer i Cancho et al, 2004; Ferrer i Cancho, 2005).A GSDN is induced from a dependency treebank intwo steps:1.
The vertices of the network are obtained fromthe word forms appearing as nuclei in the in-put treebank and from punctuation marks as faras they have been annotated and mapped ontodependency trees.
The notion of a nucleus isadapted from Lucien Tesnie`re: a nucleus is anode of a dependency tree.
Note that multipartnuclei may also occur.
We use the term typein order to denote word forms and punctuationmarks.
The reason that we induce vertices fromtypes, but not from lexemes, is that not all cor-pora are lemmatized.
Thus, the type level is theleast common denominator which allows com-paring the different networks.
Note also that asystematization of the corpora with respect tothe inclusion of punctuation marks is needed.2.
Two vertices (i.e.
types) of a GSDN are con-nected if there is at least one dependency tree inwhich their corresponding instance nuclei arelinked.
When it comes to applying the appa-ratus of complex network theory, the arc direc-tion is generally disregarded (Newman, 2003).Thus, GSDNs are simple undirected graphswithout loops or multiple edges.The attribute ?global?
distinguishes macroscopicsyntactic dependency networks from their micro-scopic counterparts in the form of syntactic depen-dency structures of single sentences.
The latter arethe usual object of dependency grammars and re-lated formalisms.
The goal of this article is to shedlight on the large-scale organization of syntactic de-pendency structures.
In terms of theoretical linguis-tics, we aim to determine the statistical propertiesthat are common to all languages (if they exist), theones that are not and to explain our findings.
Toachieve this goal, we must overcome the limits ofmany studies of linguistic networks.
Firstly, by us-ing GSDNs we intend to solve the problems of co-occurrence networks in which words are linked ifthey (a) are adjacent, (b) co-occur within a shortwindow (Ferrer i Cancho and Sole?, 2001; Milo et al,2004; Antiqueira et al, 2006; Masucci and Rodgers,2006) or (c) appear in the same sentence (Caldeiraet al, 2006).
This approach is problematic: witha couple of exceptions (Bordag et al, 2003; Fer-rer i Cancho and Sole?, 2001), no attempt is madeto filter out statistically insignificant co-occurrences.Unfortunately the filter used in (Ferrer i Canchoand Sole?, 2001) is not well-defined because it doesnot consider fluctuations of the frequencies of wordco-occurrences.
(Bordag et al, 2003) implementa collocation measure based on the Poisson distri-bution and, thus, induce collocation instead of co-occurrence networks.
However, the notion of a sen-tence window and related notions are problematic asthe probability that two words depend syntacticallydecays exponentially with the number of intermedi-ate words (Ferrer i Cancho, 2004).
Further, (Ferreri Cancho et al, 2004) shows that the proportion ofsyntactically wrong links captured from a sentenceby linking adjacent words is about 0.3 while thisproportion is about 0.5 when linking a word to its1st and 2nd neighbors.
Thus, dependency treebanksoffer connections between words that are linguisti-cally precise according to a dependency grammarformalism.
Secondly, the majority of linguistic net-work studies is performed on English only ?
withsome exceptions (Soares et al, 2005; Ferrer i Can-cho et al, 2004; Mehler, 2006).
Concerning GS-DNs, (Ferrer i Cancho et al, 2004) considers threelanguages but the syntactic dependency informationof sentences is systematically incomplete in two ofthem.
Here we aim to use complete treebanks andanalyze more (i.e.
seven) languages so that we canobtain stronger conclusions about the common sta-tistical patterns of GSDNs than in (Ferrer i Canchoet al, 2004).Therefore, this article is about statistical regulari-ties of the organization of GSDNs.
These networksare analyzed with the help of complex network the-ory and, thus by means of quantitative graph the-ory.
We hypothesize that GSDNs are homoge-neous in terms of their network characteristics whilethey differ from non-syntactic networks.
The long-term objective to analyze such distinctive featuresis to explore quality criteria of dependency tree-banks which allow separating high quality annota-66tions from erroneous ones.The remainder of this article is organized as fol-lows: Section 2 introduces the statistical measuresthat will be used for studying GSDNs of seven lan-guages.
Section 3 presents the treebanks and theirunified representations from which we induce thesenetworks.
Section 4 shows the results and Section 5discusses them.2 The statistical measuresTwo essential properties of a network are N , thenumber of vertices (i.e.
the number of types), and k?the mean vertex degree (Baraba?si and Albert, 2002).The literature about distinctive indices and distribu-tions of complex networks is huge.
Here we focuson correlations in the network structure (Serrano etal., 2006).
The reason is that correlation analysisprovides a deeper understanding of network orga-nization compared to classical aggregative ?small-world?
indices.
For instance, two networks mayhave the same degree distribution (whose similarityis measured by the exponent of power laws fitted tothem) while they differ in the degree correlation ofthe vertices forming a link.
Correlation analysis isperformed as follows: We define p(k) as the propor-tion of vertices with degree k. Here we study threemeasures of correlation (Serrano et al, 2006):?
k?nn(k) is the average degree of the nearestneighbors of the vertices with degree k (Pastor-Satorras et al, 2001).
If k?nn(k) tends to growas k grows the network is said to exhibit assor-tative mixing.
In this case, edges tend to con-nect vertices of similar degree.
If in contrast tothis k?nn(k) tends to shrink as k grows, the net-work is said to exhibit disassortative mixing.
Inthis case, edges tend to connect vertices of dis-similar degree.
If there are no correlations, thenk?nn(k) = ?

isthe 1st and?k2?the 2nd moment of the degreedistribution, namely?k?
=N?1?k=1kp(k) (1)?k2?=N?1?k=1k2p(k).
(2)In order to enable comparisons of different net-works, k?nn(k) is normalized using ?
and re-placed by k?nn(k)/?.?
c?
(k) is the mean clustering coefficient of ver-tices of degree k. The clustering coefficient ofa vertex is defined as the proportion of pairs ofadjacent vertices (u, v) such that u and v arelinked.?
c?
is the mean clustering coefficient defined asc?
=N?1?k=1p(k)c?(k).
(3)In order to test the significance of c?, we calcu-late c?binom = k?/(N ?
1), the expected cluster-ing coefficient in a control binomial graph.
Ina binomial graph, two vertices are linked withprobability p. p = k?/(N ?
1) is chosen so thatthe expected number of links of the binomialgraphs is nk?/2 as in the original network.Assortative mixing is known to be characteristicfor social-semiotic, but not for technical networks(Newman, 2003).
Recently, (Mehler, 2006) hasshown that this characteristic varies a lot for differ-ent document networks and thus allows distinguish-ing linguistic networks which are homogeneouslycalled ?small-worlds?.
We have excluded on purposethe Pearson correlation coefficient of the degrees atthe endpoints of edges that has been used in previousstudies (Ferrer i Cancho et al, 2004) due to the sta-tistical problems that this measure has in large net-works with power degree distributions (Serrano etal., 2006).3 The treebanksWe analyze seven treebanks each from a differentlanguage.
Their features are summarized in Table1.
A comprehensive description of these and re-lated banks is given by (Kakkonen, 2005).
As ex-plained by Kakkonen, one generally faces the prob-lem of the heterogeneity not only of the annotationschemes, but also of the serialization formats usedby them.
Thus, we unified the various formats in or-der to get a single interface to the analysis of syntac-tic dependency networks derived thereof.
Although67there exists a representation format for syntactic an-notations (i.e.
TIGER-XML?
cf.
(Mengel and Lez-ius, 2000)) we decided to use the Graph eXchangeLanguage (GXL) in order to solve the heterogeneityproblem.
The GXL has been proposed as a uniformformat for data interchange (Holt et al, 2006).
Itallows representing attributed, directed, undirected,mixed, ordered, hierarchical graphs as well as hyper-graphs.
Its application-dependent attribution modelconcerns vertices, edges and graphs.
Because ofits expressiveness it was utilized in modeling con-stituency structures (Pustylnikov, 2006) as well asnonlinear document structures (Mehler, 2007b).
Weutilize it to map syntactic dependency structures.Our GXL binding is schematically explained asfollows: corpora are mapped onto graphs which se-rialize graph models of sentence-related dependencystructures.
Each of these structures is mapped as aforest whose directed edges are mapped by meansof the GXL?s edge model.
This model preserves theorientation of the input dependency relations.
Figure1 visualizes a sample dependency tree of the Slovenedependency treebank (Dz?eroski et al, 2006).Figure 1: Visualization of a sample sentence of theSlovene dependency treebank (Dz?eroski et al, 2006)based on its reconstruction in terms of the GXL.4 ResultsA summary of the network measures obtained on theseven corpora is shown in Table 2.
We find thatc?

Figure 2shows that the clustering c?
(k) decreases as k in-creases.
Figure 3 shows that k?nn(k) decreases ask increases, indicating the presence of disassortativemixing when forming links, i.e.
links tend to com-bine vertices of dissimilar degrees.
For sufficientlylarge k the curves suggest a power-law behavior, i.e.k?nn(k) ?
k?
?.5 DiscussionWe have found that the behavior of k?nn(k) suggestsk?nn(k) ?
k??
for sufficiently large k. A power-lawbehavior has been found in technical systems (Ser-rano et al, 2006).
In a linguistic context, a power-law like behavior with two regimes has been foundin the word adjacency network examined in (Ma-succi and Rodgers, 2006).
A decreasing k?nn(k) forgrowing k (an indicator of dissortative mixing) hasbeen found in biological and social systems (Serranoet al, 2006).
A decreasing c?
(k) for growing k hasbeen found in many non-linguistic systems (e.g.
theInternet map at the autonomous system level), andalso in a preliminary study of Czech and Germansyntactic dependency networks (Ferrer i Cancho etal., 2004).
(Ravasz and Baraba?si, 2003) suggestthat this behavior indicates the existence of a hierar-chical network organization (Ravasz and Baraba?si,2003).
In our case this may indicate the existenceof a core vocabulary surrounded by more and morespecial vocabularies.
This observation is in accor-dance with a multipart organization of the rank fre-quency distribution of the lexical units involved.
Butthis stratification is not simply due to the words?collocation patterns, but to their behavior in syntac-tic dependency structures.
We have also found thatc?
c?binom, which is a common feature of non-linguistic (Newman, 2003) and linguistic networks(Mehler, 2007a) and, thus, is not very informative.In sum, we have seen that GSDNs follow a com-mon pattern of statistical correlations regardless ofthe heterogeneity of the languages and annotationcriteria used.
This suggests that the structure ofGSDNs may originate from language independentprinciples.
Since the correlational properties of GS-DNs are not unique to these networks, our findingssuggest that these principles may also be commonto certain non-linguistic systems.
Thus, in order tomake GSDNs distinguishable in terms of their char-acteristics, finding more expressive network coeffi-68Figure 2: c?
