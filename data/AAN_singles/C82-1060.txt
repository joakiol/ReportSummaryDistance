Ac~lon~ 1982COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF MANDARIN SOUNDSWITH REFERENCE TO THE ENGLISH LANGUAGEChing Y. SuenDepartment of Computer ScienceConcordia University1455 de Maisonneuve WestMontreal, Canada H3G IM8In the analysis of Mandarin, the author used acorpus composed of over 750,000 samples transcribedautomatically from Chinese characters by the com-puter through the sequential application of a setof phonetic rules developed by the author.
Theresult is a classif ication and rank distributionof all speech sounds, the phonetic properties,frequency distr ibution of symbols, phonemes, syl-lables, tones, and their combinations.
Thesestatistical properties are compared with those ofthe English language.INTRODUCTIONEnglish is widely used throughout the world while Mandarin is spokenin China by one quarter of the world's population.
It is interest-ing to compare the phonetic properties of these two languages and tostudy their similarities and differences to understand the problemsinvolved when the speakers of one language learn to speak the otherlanguage.The linguistic aspects of written English and Chinese, such as thosepresented below, have already been studied extensively (see Suen(1979 a & b)), e.g.
a) the frequency of occurrence of words/characters, b) the statistical distribution of letters/radicals,and their combinations, c) the study of syntax, semantics, prag-matics, and related areas, and d) translation of one language intoanother.
Also the linguistics aspects of spoken English have beendescribed in well-known literature (Dewey (1923), Carterette et al(1974)), e.g.
a) the frequency of occurrence of syllables, b) thestatistical distribution of phonemes and their combination s , c) thephonetic system and symbolic representation of sounds, and d) a-coustical analysis, recognition and synthesis of the spoken language.Such investigations, however, have been rarely conducte~'"on Mandarin,the official language spoken in China, owing to many reasons.
Inorder to close this gap, the author has initiated several researchprojects aimed specifically at the analysis of these aspects (Suen(1979 b)).PROPERTIES OF MANDARINMandarin sounds consist of consonants, vowels, semi-vowels and diph-thongs.
A Mandarin syllable comprises 1 to 3 such constituents, thefirst symbol is usually a consonant.
The syllabic structure ofMandarin is shown below.

neutra l  5For example, the sy l lab le  /WOV/, mean ing  "I" in Engl ish, has a lowr is ing tone.
Since there are only about 400 d i f fe rent  sy l lab les  inthe whole  Mandar in  language, the tone is cruc ia l  in s ign i fy ing themean ing  of words.
This property  of Mandar in  is d i s t inc t  from theEngl ish sounds.COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS  OF DATAIn computat iona l  l inguist ics ,  it is essent ia l  to have a large col lec-t ion of data in order  to der ive re l iab le  results.
The help of aCOMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF MANDARIN SOUNDS 373computer is indispensable.
In this study, computational analysis ofa corpus composed of more than 750,000 samples of Mandarin syllableswas made.
More details .can be found in Suen (1979 b).
Owing to thel imitation of space here, this paper only compares the frequencydistr ibution of Mandarin and English phonemes.
The distr ibution ofEnglish sounds was derived from a study conducted by Carterette andJones (1974).
Their phonemic frequencies were obtained from atranscription of 15,694 words spoken by 24 subjects.REMARKS ON MANDARIN/ENGLISH SOUNDSFrom Tables 1 and 2, one can make the following observations:(a) Mandarin consonants occur 8% less frequently than English con-sonants(b) Semi-vowels are used twice more often in Mandarin than inEnglish(c) Vowels occur more frequently in Mandarin than in English(d) Chinese speakers used diphthongs more often than Englishspeakers(e) Mandarin tones are not evenly distributed and the 4th toneoccurs much more frequently than the others(f) Although both English and Mandarin have approximately 40phonemes, many Mandarin phonemes do not occur in the Englishlanguage, especial ly the retroflex and dental sibi lant sounds,and the round-l ipped vowel ~ which occur rather frequently(about 12%) in Mandarin conversations(g) There is considerable difference in the distr ibution of Mandarinand English diphones, triphones, etc.
which affect signif icant-ly the formation of syllables in these two languages(h) Considerable difference also occurs between the syllabicstructures of English and Mandarin(i) There are many more sound patterns in English (about one dis-tinct sound for one word) than in Mandarin (only about 1160distinct sounds in the entire language)Implications of the above on the learning of Mandarin by Englishspeakers will be discussed.
Their effects on computer synthesisand recognition of Mandarin speech will  also be presented.
If timepermits, the author wishes to present his new phonetic system whichwil l  enable an English speaker to pronounce Mandarin sounds correctlyand easily.
Encouraging results of applying this new system in thelearning situation will be discussed.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis research was supported by a grant from the Kung Chung Wo Co.,Ltd.
