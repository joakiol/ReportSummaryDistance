R. GermanyAbstract:Ihis paper outlines a practical approach to our project to design anintelligent system that supports an expert user for his understanding andrepresenting news reports on a special world of the japanese computer industry.With the extensive help of the intelligent system the expert user purposefullyassimilates new information in a knowledge data base of a frame-likerepresentation through a multiple window interface.l .
l n t roduet ionRecent computer appl icat ion to theso-cal led off ice automat ion ischaracter ized by the increasing use ofintel l igent software systems.
Thesesystems are often required to interfacewith textual informat ion via users whoare more or less trained or expert izedto deal with the kinds of in format ionto be processed.
The ideal goal of sucha text process ing  system is to t rans ferall experts 'process ing tasks to thesystem.
It must be well recognized,however, that even with regard to themost advanced knowledge-based naturallanguage processing systems such asSOPHIE(1), SAM(Z), FRUMP(3), GUS(4),EXPIUS(5) this ideal goal seems to 5es t i l l  far from the present state of thenatural language (N\[) processingtechn iques ,  though they  are  verypromiss ing .
There are many reasons  whyex is t ing  Nl systems can hard ly  beapp l ied  to the above goa l .
Two of  themmay be fo rmulated  as fo l lows :(a) The present re lat ively robust NIsystems have been basical lydes igned  to dea l  w i th  each separatesentence  and not  w i th  a set  o fsemant ica l ly  related sentences.There are many research effortsaiming at this point (el.
eg.approaches of the Yale Nl school).
(b) Because the N\[ understand ingsystems are general ly  concernedwith deep understandings  ofsentences, they often take care toomuch of genera l  relat ions and(common sense) reasonings in everydetail ,  to which readers don't payattent ions so much in understand ingthem.
Human readers sk i l l fu l lycontrol depth and detai ls  ofunders tand ings  being conscious oftheir potent ia l  usefulness.
Inshort, the present N\[ systems arenot enough expl ic i t ly  designed toextract purposeful  meaning ofsentences (el.
(4)).In this deve lop ing  s ta te  of Nlprocess ing and knowledge  representat iontechniques we set a pract ical  goal ofour project to design an interact ivesystem which digests news and reportson the foreign computer  industry tosupport experts by s react ive knowledgedata  base.
At the  moment such aknowledge  data  base i s  u rgent ly  neededfo r  exper ts  to  do the i r  tasks  such aswr i t ing  repor ts  to  be submi t ted  to somegovernmenta l  ins t i tu t ions ,  indust r ia lc red i t  bureaus  or agenc ies  and thel i ke .2 .
In teract ive  ass imi la t ion  and abstract ionTypical experts' tasks in an industr ia lcredit bureau above ment ioned are, forinstance , to col lect information abouta special world such as the news worldof computer industry.
They col lectc l ippings of news papers or journals,make memos from other news media andclassi fy them according to their topicso r  themes.
Their understanding of suchinformat ion means that they not onlyunderstand the meaning (surfacesemantics) of each art ic le l i teral ly  ,but also ass imi late it into theirrelated knowledge base (deep semantics)in such s way that  it can bee f fec t ive ly  used in  some fu turecontexts .
That i s ,  they  ident i fyre la t ions  of  the new in fo rmat ion  w i thThis research was supported in part by Ostasien-Tnstitut,e.V., Bonn--504--some parts of their knowledge andrecognize its potential  usefulness fortheir new conceptua l i zat ion  toadvocate ,  to  emphas ize  or bu i ld  upthe i r  op in ions ,  judgements  or be l ie fs .The way of  summing-ups by abst rac t ionand ass imi la t ion  o f  suceess ivein fo rmat ion  to const ruc t  a spec ia lknowledge-base  s t rong ly  depends on thepurposes ,  as i t  i s  genera l ly  s ta ted  inempir ical  ep is temology(15,15) .
In ourpract i ca l  ease th i s  means that  theexper ts  purposefu l ly  'unders tand '  thenews to wr i te  a eomprehens ive  repor t  onthe  computer  indust ry  in  which  theydraw from i t  conc lus ions  such as fu turetendencies or proposals  for someindustr ia l  pol icies, etc.Taking both avai lable teehn iques  andreal ity of problems into account ,  wedecided on the whole not to d irect lyapply N\[ process ing approaches to ourexper t  suppor t  sys tem.
Ins tead ,  weextens ive ly  use N\[ techn iques  fo r  caseby case.
Start ing with the lowestinte l l igent  level of interact ion,  wehope that we could cont inuous ly  elevatethe intel l igent level of the machineprocess ings in the recycl ing course ofdesign and exper iences (5).The interface of the machine-expertinteract ion is based on the mult ip lewindow display communicat ion (s.seet.5)and the mechanical  representat ion ofexperts knowledge is founded on thef rame- l ike formal ism (s.seet.3 and 4).In the interact ive text analysis  andmeaning representat ion  an expert readsa news art icle from his special domainof computer industry and has var iouslevels of understand ings  typical lyref lect ing his special domain dependentknowledge and his evaluat ion of newsvalues.
Some part of his specialknowledge is act ivated, new informat ionfrom the art ic le is eventual ly  added onit, a part of the exist ing knowledge isacknowledged,  refined, ampl i f ied orreversed, etc.In contrast to this expl ic it  flow ofinformat ion from texts to the expertuser there is a implicit  counter flowof predict ive,  expect ive or focalinformat ion which is feedbacked to thetexts.
In this sort of "backed-up"i n te ract ion  between text  source  andexper t ' s  knowledge ,  there  are rough lytwo classes of informat ion to berepresented:( i )Conceptual  informationGeneral ly  speaking, the content of anews art icle is expressed in textsentenses, ie a restr icted set ofnatural language in which they arewritten.
However, for the expert of aspecial  news world texts are a set ofkey concepts mostly well def ined andstructured within his knowledge, thoughthey are organized by general syntact icrules of the language on s surfacelevel.
These key concepts indicate forhim how to use them.
The methods ofusing his knowledge, are descr ibed inprocedures and st ructura l ly  inherent inthe concepts.
The expert 's  responses toa key concept scanned from a given textare that(a) related concepts around a given keyconcept are st imulated(b) some concepts are expected in thesubsequent scanning of the texts.
(c) These st imulated or expectedconcepts interact with each otherto constrain and fi lter theirsemantic roles.
(ii) Control informat ionThe interact ive flow of conceptualinformat ion is contro l led by controlinformat ion which is partly invoked bythe former.
The experts responses (a)(b) (c) can be viewed as the evaluat ionresults of the control informationcaused by understanding the eoneeptualinformation,  this means that conceputalinformat ion impl ies the controlinformation whieh speci f ies how theformer should be processed orinterpreted under which condit ions andwhat should be done when the former isto be perceived.
For (a) the controlinformation speci f ies the act ivat ion ofall concepts  that  are  re la ted  to the--505--key concepts in some way, for (b) itspeci f ies  Lhe search of a term wh ichsat i f ies a given condit ion and for (c)it speci f ies the context to which allact ivated eoncepts in Lerma of a keyconcept must be subject.The cogn i t ive  in teract ion  between textsand exper t  can be ac t ive ly  suppor ted  bya system in  that  both  sor ts  ' o fin format ion are direct ly  or indirect lyt ransferred to the system in the courseof data base organizat ion process.
Thistr iadic relat ion between texts, expertand system can be model led as a doubleproduct ion system (Fig.l), in which anTexLsI S T MI f- " I  E x p e r tIII Knowledge  Data  Base II.

However ,w i th  inc reas ing  amount o f  in fo rmat iont rans fer  from the exper t  user  to thesys tem,  th i s  ro le  o f  the  exper t  user  asITN aga ins t  the knowledge  data  basesystem i s  g radua l ly  changed to the ro leo f  STM.
Then the  user ' s  cont ro lfunct ion  of  in teract ive  process  i staken  over  by the sys tem.

Theyare par t ly  ident ica l  to those  wh ich  areexp l i c i t l y  s ta ted  by the proponent  off rame theory  (7)  or the des igners  offrame-like representat ion languages,Fo l low ing  reasons  are more or lessspec i f i c  fo r  our  case :(1 )  Exper t ' s  knowledge  about  thecomputer  indust ry  and i t s  deve lopmentsare  o rgan ized  around the conceptua lunits which are more or lessstandardized.E.g.
"Main- f rame-makers"  is a conceptfor the expert that is used inconjunct ion with the computer-po l icy-making in Japan.
(2) Roles of conceptual  objects arere lat ively clear and not much f lexiblein the target information space.Eg.
MBI i s  a r iva l  o f  a nat iona lmain-frame-makers and the nat ionalindustr ia l  Ministry ITIM, whichspeci f ies  market strategic pol icies.
(3) Because of the reason (2) controlinformat ion associated with each roleof  a conceptua l  un i t  i s  we l lfo rmulated .
E .g .
I f  MBI announces  a newproduct  o f  H-Ser ies ,  the  exper t  expectsthe concept  o f  M-Ser ies  ofmain-frame-makers.

Part icu lar ly ,  it is hard tofind some procedural  property in it,which is tr iggered by matching apattern descr ibed as a prerequ is i tecondi t ion in it.
At the moment apattern marcher of OBJTA\[K does thistask.
Start ing from the recipientobject of a message the marchersearches through a inher i tancehierarchy of the object a procedurecal led method which can be matched withthe message body.For s imple dese ipt ions  of passivepropert ies  SRL (semantic epresentat ionl anguage)  o f  EXP\[US (5)  avo ided  th i st ime consuming prob lem of  p roper tyinher i tance  by making an externa lb i t - tab le  which represents  aheraroh ica \ ]  property  re la t ions  ca l ledsemantic feature systems.
For morecompl icated property descr ipt ions  suchas procedural  patterns we need a sortof global assoc iat ive  bit -map memorywhich mappes the procedura lproper ty -space onto the object space sothat, given a procedural  property by amessage, those objects assoc iated withthis property can be retr ieved veryfast without any searches.
Thisassoc iat ive  bit -map memory mustdynamica l ly  store any new re lat ionsbetween objects and propert ies.
Such aglobal assoc iat ive  memory contrad ictsthe fram-l ike ob jec t -o r ientedrepresentat ion  pr incip le which dictatesthe d is t r ibut ion  of propert ies  amongobjects.
The ph i losophica l  just i f i -cation of a pr par ty /ob jectassoc iat ions  are founded on the generaltheory of ob jec t -pred icate  rec iproc i ty(12) .4.Hierarchical scr ipt  frames for stereofiypicalityOur human experts roughly c lass i fyco l lected news and reports on thecomputer industry according to theirtopics,eg,  I I IM vs .
MBI, ITIM po l i cyfor in format ion industry promotion, newproduct announcements  from a computerindustry, etc.A main topic is assigned to each classwhich may be character i zed  by s set ofpredicates to be sat is f ied by membersof  the  c lass .
On th i s  g loba l  c lassleve l  our  news wor ld  i s  s te reotyp ica l .However ,  i f  we t ry  to  represent  manyrepor ts  o f  the same c lass  in  astereotyp ica l  form, we get a largesparse table but items are local lyf i l led with var ious levels ofdeta i l s .
(F ig .2) .
However,  if we lookinto the contents of each report of aclass under the surface of its maintopic, we find on local levels someother subtopics which are not alwayscons is tent ly  subord inate  to the maintopic.This means first of all, there is noc lear  cut between c lasses ,  and eachc lass  cannot be complete ly  formulatedin a s tereotyp ica l  form.
Secondly, i fwe go down to the lower leve l  of maintopic descr ipt ions  ie.
subtopics,  wefind that the s tereotp ica l i ty  isstronger within a subtopic.
Eachsubtopic is descr ibed in d i f ferentlevels of detai ls.
We can come up withthis s i tuat ion by using h ierarch ica lscript frames (cf .
(13)),  where asubord inate  script frames specify moredetai led forms of the superord inate--508--script frame.
Those are connected tothe latter in part-of  or isa re lat ions(Fig.3).

There are somecogn i t ive -percept ive  reasons for usinga mult ip le  window user interface.
Oneof the most important reasons is thatthe user has a mult ip le  (or paral lel)contact with the machine, which offershim paral le l  decis ion a l ternat ives  aswell as supports for short term memoryduring the course of interact iveprocesses.
In contrast with the act ofscanning e newspaper through a pinholethe user can avoid back- t rack ings  ofd ia log  l i s t ings  wh i le  keepings imul taneous ly  var ious  k inds  o fin format ion each displayed in a window.This makes the user feel free from thelabyr inth effects,  being always awareof what the machine is doing and inwhich state of interact ion he is.
Byreducing the labyr inth effects on theuser, the machine offers him a betteropportun i ty  to plan his imputbehaviour.
The appl icat ion of a windowsys tem to  our  in teract ive  textproeess ings  adds more cons is tency ofrepresentat ions  to the system.A window may display s whole frame forthe user to fill in some slots whi leone other window shows the ether frame,whose name is just ment ioned by thefirst one.
Another one contains onlynames of those frames which aredirect ly or indirect ly  ment ioned inother frames.
There are control windowswhich offer the user a set of controlcommandos and software tools such aseditors (lISP editor, frame editor,kowledge editor),  by which he contro lsthe interact ive process for embedding--509--new in format ion ,  rev is ing  the old oneor c reat ing  new frame scr ipts ,  etc.
