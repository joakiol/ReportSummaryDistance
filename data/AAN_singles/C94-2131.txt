INTRODUCTIONThe Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar(HPSG, Polhu'd & Sag,87 and 93) came into be=ing as and remains apredominantly s ntactic the-ory.
This is reflected not only in the main theoret~ical orientation, but also in the structuration oflinguistic data within (the standard versions o0the theory.As the majot-ity, if not all, current heo-ries, HPSG relies on an ample representation flinguistic knowledge within the lexicon ratherthan in the grammar rules.
This knowledge, then,is in HPSG organized in a crossing inheritancehierarchy of lexical types, which should expressthe regularities and generalizations ~v,:curring inthe lexicon and thus awfid redundant s ipulations.However, in spite of the fact that the lexi-con - at least as far as the amount of informationis concerned - plays an absolutely central role inthe theory, the organization of data within HPSGclearly reflects the primary syntactic oncerti ofthe theory, with lexicon on a secondary positiononly.
In particular, this comes into light when thepresence of more tradition',fl views of organizationof lexical data (proved useful by long lexico-graphic and linguistic practice) is sought - suchviews are represented only marginally or not atall t.in this paper, I shall try(i) to show that neglecting standard insights ofthe organization of lexicon is detrimental both tothe linguistic adequacy and to the practical usefid-ness of the lexicon,(ii) to make a proposal of an alternative r concil~ing the needs of HPSG with the usual lexico-graphic practice.2.
TIlE HPSG STANDARDAs the basic type of object of linguistic descrip-tion HPSG adopts the sign 2, and builds a sub-sumption hierarchy of its subtypes, whose toplevel is sketched in (1).signphrasal l ex ica l  / \major milxo~The idea behind this hierarchy is that each node isassociated with bundles of features, which are in-herited by all nodes directly or indirectly subordi-nated to this node, by means of which a lot of re-dundant stipulations of features can be removed.There are, however, two points about thehierarchy fi'om (1) which may be worth reconsid-ering.
First, it is the fact that linguistics in generalis concerned with a broader class of objects thausigns - e.g., phonemes, morphs etc.
are objectshaving no semantics, i.e.
they ~- by definition -cannot fall into the class of signs, and if ItPSGaims at becoining a full linguistic theory, theseobjects have to be also taken into consideration.Second, the hierarchy reflects only the syntacti-cally motivated ivision of lexic~d signs into ma-jor and minor ones, but tire other possible - and infact more standard - divisions into autosemanticvs.
synsemantic 3 words and productive vs. non-productive word classes are missing.Apart from this, tlPSG stipulates tire lexi-con to be a full-fornl one, i.e.
a lexicon where allword-forms of a language occur as actual items inthe lexicon (leaf nodes in the hierarchy).
This isalso an approach which hardly finds a parallel inthe standard lexicographic practice (even for lan~guages with that poor morphology as Englishhas), and in addition an approach which at leaston the explanatory level enforces the necessity oflexical (redundancy) rules - which, on the otherhand, do not fit into the general image of HPSGat all.l'rovided that the lexicon is viewed from a"declarative" perspective 4, the lexical rules ex-press static rehttionships ( uch as inflection) be-tween members of word classes.
These relation-ships are, however, not needed for the fimction-ing of the system (since all word forms are avail-able anyway) - they have to exist only becausewithout hem the lexicon would be linguisticallyclearly inadequate.The other option, namely the "procedural"perspective, seems to be even worse, since itbreaks the overall "declarative" strategy ofHPSG; in particular, it enforces inequality of sta-tus of different lexical items (some being "basic"and some beiug only "derived" - in the very pro-cedural sense of the word).8233.
RELATIONAL CONSTRAINTSAS ALTERNATIVEBased on the preceding facts and (first ofall) on the standard linguistic practice, it is possi-ble to propose an alternative hierarchy of objects alinguistic theory should deal with, whose "toppart" can be sketched as in the crossing hierarchygiven in (2), where appurtenance of several sub-types of a type to classification according to thesame key is marked off by an arc connecting therespective branches of the hierarchy - in particu-lar, two divisions according to different keys areto be observed for the class "linguistic object",one corresponding to a "functional" perspective(the division into signs and non-signs), the otherone corresponding toa "formalisfic" perspective 5.

In particular, it is worth toobserve the parallel between the construction ofphrases (which consist of words) and the con-struction of words (consisting of morphemes and- in case of composed words - of bases, i.e.combinations of autosemantic morphemes).
In anHPSG-like notation, the "consisting of" can beapproximated by the feature structure (3), withobvious meaning of the relational constraintsphon_cons is ts_o f  and sem_cons is ts_o f .

In particular, the differences are that:a. phrases consist of other phrases, but words (atleast as a rule) do not consist of other wordsb.
for a word, at most one among its constituents,Re base, is autosemantic (at least as a rule, again)Taking into consideration this as well asstill other factors, one can build up in more detailthe top of the hierarchy of linguistic objects as in(4) (the "lexicon" part of the hierarchy beingmarked off by the interrupted line).

Bythe very fact that this class - by definition - sub-sumes all inflected words and by parallel to (3),this class should be associated with the con-strained feature structure (5).824(5) phon: 1pref ixes :{  \[phon.

,2k+2})The definition of the relational constraint in (5) isactually the formal definition of inflection in therespective language 6.
In particular, this allows forexpressing the part-of-speech independent regu-larities of inflection on one slot of the languagemodel rather than repeatedly as with standardlexical rules (an example of such regularity mightbe the infix -e- in English words "goes" and"potatoes").Having viewed the "top" part of the lexicalhierarchy, let us turn our attention now to itsbottom and middle.The leaf elements of the hierarchy are lex-emes - feature bundles encoding the most id-iosyncratic information about a particular word.As a rule, a lexeme consists of the base Cr oot")of the word and of the semar tic information as-sociated with this base.In the typical case, a lexeme of an in-flected word has two immediate superclasses.These correspond to the cross-classification f(inflected) words according to, first, subcatego-rization requirements of the respective word (as instandard HPSG), and, second, according to theinflection class of the word.
The respective sub-categorization class then assigns to the wordthose subcategorization requirements which arenot influenced by its morphology, as well as ba-sic information about he nature of subcategoriza-tion requirements which do undergo changes dueto the morphological form of the word.
The in-flection class, then, in the form of a relationalconstraint ties together the morphological featuresof the word with the respective affix(es), the con-straint being in fact the (traditional) inflectiontable.Finally, when these two classes meet up-per in the hierarchy, the class where they meetdefines, again via a relational constraint, he exactrelation between the subcategorization a d themorphological form of the word.
The example (6)showing the verb "accuse" might clarify this.

dIn the case of totally inegularly inflected words, itwould be of course inadequate opostulate a classexpressing the inflection of this very one wordonly.
The simplest solution in this case is to as-sociate the respective relational constraint ex-pressing inflection directly with the lexeme, cf.example (7) (technical variations concerning tilebase and affixes are possible, but insubstantial).

CONCLUSIONSIn this paper I tried to show how relational con-straints can take over the bulk of (if not all) thework which is in standard HPSG assigned to theoperation of lexical rules.Such an approach as at least the follow-ing two major advantages:1. it is much more straightforwardly related to thestandard lexicographic and morphological usage,a matter which is of a remarkable theoretical ndeven greater practical importance2.
the disadvantages of the lexical rules approachto lexicon mentioned in the first part of this paper(either inherent procedurality of the description orinherent redundancies in the description) disap-pear with the replacement of the (also formallypoorly understood) lexical rules by the standardmachinery of relational constraints.As a minor point in favour of the sketchedapproach it might be noted that it also easilyavoids such counterintuitive stipulations as postu-lating the division of English verbs into classes"auxiliary", "main" and a singleton class "have-as-abstract-verb" (cf.
Pollard and Sag,87, p.215)which was necessary due to the fact that both themain verb "have" and the auxiliary "have" are ofthe same - idiosyncratic - inflection class.
All thatis necessary to say on the given approach is thatthe two "have"s differ as to their contents and asto their subcategorization (i.e.
they constitute twolexemes at the bottom of the lexical hierarchy),while simultaneously belonging to the same con-jugation class, cf.
(8).

also the following complete quotation of Sect 8.3.Suggestions for further eading from (Pollard & Sag,87) p.218:The key ideas in this chapter (i.e.
"The Lexical Hierarchyand Lexical Rules") arise not from previous linguisticstudies, but rather from algebraic approaches to datatypetheory and the semantics of programming such as ...; sim-ilar ideas are widely employed inframe-based knowledgerepresentation systems (see ...).l just want to point out that hardly anyone wouldprotest if"the key ideas ... arise not ONLY from previous linguisticstudies, but ALSO from ...".
tlowever, the current word-ing explicitly excludes any reference to previous linguisticwork.21n accordance with the tradition going back at least o deSaussure (Saussure,15), a sign is an object relating a(phonetic)form and a (semantic) ontent.31n different erminology, "content vs. function".4 Cf.
(Pollard & Sag,87), p.209 ff.5 Though (2) corre,~ponds rather well to the traditional pic~ture, it is worth remarking that a more simple hierarchycan be achieved by making phrase, word, word-base andmorpheme subtypes of sign (in a division different fromthe autosemantic/synsemantic opposition) while makingmorph and smaller units sub-ciasses of non-sign.
For ourpurpose, this point is, however, immaterial.6 Taken strictly, as it is, the definition does not take intoconsideration i troflective languages.
This, however, canbe remedied simply by reformulating the constraint accord?ingly.826
