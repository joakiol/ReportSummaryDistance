abstractPRAGMATICS IN MACHINE TRANSLATIONAnnely RothkegelUnivers i t~t  Saarbr~ckenSonderforschungsbereich 100Elektronische SprachforschungD 6600 Saarbr~ckenWest-GermanyTEXAN is a sysLem of bransfer,.oriented text  analysis.I ts  l ingu is t i c  concept is based on a communicativeappY'oacll wi th in the framework of speech act theory.In this view texts are considered to be the resu l t  ofl ingu is t i c  actions?
I t  is assumed that  they controlthe select ion of t rans la t ion  equivalents.
The trans-i t i on  of th is  concept of l ingu is t i c  actions ( textacts) to the model of computer analysis is performedby a context - f ree i l l ocut ion  grammar processing cate-gories of actions and a proposit ional  structure ofstates of a f fa i r s .
The grammar whicll is re lated to atext  lexicon provides the connection of these catego-r ies and the l ingu is t i c  surface units of a singlelanguage.I .
The ProblemOne of the main tasks of machine t rans la t ion ,  besidesthe resolut ion of ambiguities and the generation ofappropriate structura l  analyses, is tlle select ion ofadequate t rans la t ion  equivalents.
I t  has been Foundthat  an analysis which even produces unequivocal re-suits does not suf f ice for  the production of pragma-t i ca l l y  adequate texts in the target language.a d i f fe rent  text  type i t  may be r ight  or even musthave th is  form.
On the other hand, regulat ions (REGU-LATE) d i f fe r  in verb forms.
Thus in German presenttense is to be used, in English shal l - forms, and inFrench present and future may be a l te rnat ives .
A ge-neral p r inc ip le  is,  that  the part ic ipants  never arepronominalize(loThe question now is what kind of l ingu is t i c  model canhell) us to structure the re\].evanL components of theanalysis system?2.
Concept of Text Acts (TA)Our system needs a l ingu is t i c  model in which content,function and form of l ingus i t i c  expressions in a textare connected.
We think that  a ~ood concept for  th ispurpose may be the concept of text  acts (Rothkegel1984).
TA are speech acts in which texts are produced.When we t rans la te ,  we are producing a new text .We fo l low Searle's analysis of speecll acts into i l l o -cut ionary,  proposi t ional  and locut ionary parts andassume, with respect to texts ,  the existence of threeThere are problems wiLh respect to the select ion ofappropriate lexemes, co l locat ions ,  idiomatic expres-sions on the one hand.
On the otl ler hand we have toknow what kind of syntact ic  patterns and anaphorica\]or e l l ip t i ca l  constructions usual ly are applied withrespect to t.he text  type.
What we need is informaLionon cummunicative norms.
In addit ion to a syrYtacLicand/or semantic analysis we have to provide a pragma-t i c  component especia l ly  in order to solve problemson the \]eve\] of transfer?The notion that  l ingu is t i c  usage and tlle select ion ofrneans of expression ( \ ]ex is  and syntax) is directed byor at least influenced by -communicative intent -ions has received increasing at tent ion  witl l  respectto problems of t rans la t ion?
Recent research in th isarea include communicative grammars for  foreign-\]an~guage learning (e.g.
Leech/Svartvik 1975), but alsomore speci f ic  Studies which exp l i c i ty  Lake account oftext  function (ReiS/Vermeer 1984., ThJel 1980) and as-pects of action in texts (HOnig/KuSmaul 1982).
Thesestudies have influenced the theoret ica l  foundationsof TEXAN to the extent tt lat we view communicative as-pects as decis ive for  the solut ion of t rans la t ionproblems.Some stlort examples of our texts ( interact ing-regula~Ling texts ,  especia l ly  in ternat iona l  t reat ies )mayi l lus t ra te  th is  approach.
We should know when a spe~c ia i  pattern has to be applied in d i f fe rent  languagesand when iL has to be changed.
I t  has been found inthese texts that there is a special type of de f in i -t ion (DEFINE) with lex ica l  res t r i c t ions  and which a l -ways is real ized by par t i c ip le  constructions in Eng-l i sh ,  German, French, I ta \ ] ien ,  etc.
A t rans la t ion  bya re la t ive  clause, e.g.
in German, would be wrong.
Inparts of text  acts ( I :  tex t  i l l ocut ion ;  T: tl lematicspec i f i cat ion  of Bile proposi t ional  part;  R: reper-to i res of lex ica l  and grammatical expressions whichare typ ica l ly  used For a speci f ic  communicative task) .\]A : ( l ,  T, R )Automatic procedures for tile processing of speech actbas ica l ly  have to do with the select ion and represen-ta t ion  of contextual factors?
They determine the as-signment oF i l l ocut ions  to l ingu is t i c  utterances (Gaz-dar 1981).
What models developed for  th is  purpose havein common is the use of overa l l  schemas whithin whichthe respective speech acts can be interpreted.
WhileEvans (1981)l landles general de f in i t ions  of s i tuat ion ,A l \ ]en/Perrau l t  (1980), Cohen (1978) and Grosz (1982)use general action plans in which the speech acts oFinterest  are embedded.
This p r inc ip le ,  which is appl-ied to dialogues in the models mentioned, we haveapplied to wr i t ten texts in TEXAN (example of an art..ic le  in F ig .
l ) .3.
Model of Analysisl-he analysis of text  acts is or iented conceptual ly ina top-down fashion.
In tile context of machine proces-sing, however, we have to re ly  on the l ingu is t i c  sur-face as input data.
TEXAN is a system which bui lds onother programs already completed with in our pro ject .We use a syntax parser (SAIAN, cf.
SALEM 1980), forinstance, which provides a descr ipt ion of const i tuentstructure and valencies.
Furthermore, we use a programfor  ease-grammatical analysis (PROLID, cf.
Harbusch/Rothkege\] 1984) which provides a ro le in terpreta t ionon the descr ipt ion of const i tuent  structure.
Input in-to TEXAN , then, is a complete st ructura l  and case-re la t iona l  descr ipt ion of sentences.

In pr ic ip le ,  the task here is to bundle theavailable information on syntax, lexis and thematicroles in a form suitable to the determination of theunderlying i l l ocut ion .
Nevertheless, the concept oftext acts is the basis for  the structure of data.

According to the twotasks of TEXAN TEl_ includes hwo sections of informa-tion: an idenhif icat ion section concerning the textact structure (TAS) which is described by types of i l -locution and roles such as REGULATE (case) ,  SPECIFY(object), etc.,  and a selection section consisting ofl i s ts  of repertoires which belong to several singlelanguages (TAE:R(LI .

As a third par\[ a key (K)is established which provides the connection of inputdata and the TA-information.
On the level of simplei l locut ions the key represented by the lemma of thehead of the respective phrase; on the level of complexi l locut ions the key is the i l locuhion of a lower level.An entry of IEL has the fol lowing design:TELl: I. key (lemma or i l locut ionc)2.

TAE (R (LI: \],g)R (L2: l ,g)R.(LAI l ,g))I t  is possible that one key corresponds to several en-tries of TEL.
This is the case i f  there are differentTAS.GRILL provides rules which represent the structure ofINT and HAS and which transform them into procedures.GRILL (grammar' of i l \ ]ocut ions) has such a form that i tcan be processed by a context-free grammar parser.
Aparser has been developed according to the structureof the programming language COMSKEE.
Elements of theTEF-component ( l i s t ing  of propositions of the text)are integrated as parameter (F) into the rules.a) rule (RIO) for terminals (lexicon rule):I e (T i ) / (F ' )  := lemma z, (T i) / (F ' )e.g.
