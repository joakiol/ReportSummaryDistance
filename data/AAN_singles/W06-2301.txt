Robust Parsing, Error Mining, Automated LexicalAcquisition, and EvaluationGertjan van NoordUniversity of Groningenvannoord@let.rug.nlAbstractIn our attempts to construct a wide coverage HPSG parser for Dutch, techniques to improvethe overall robustness of the parser are required at various steps in the parsing process.Straightforward but important aspects include the treatment of unknown words, and thetreatment of input for which no full parse is available.Another important means to improve the parser's performance on unexpected input is theability to learn from your errors.
In our methodology we apply the parser to large quantities oftext (preferably from different types of corpora), and we then apply error mining techniques toidentify potential errors, and furthermore we apply machine learning techniques to correctsome of those errors (semi-)automatically, in particular those errors that are due to missing orincomplete lexical entries.Evaluating the robustness of a parser is notoriously hard.
We argue against coverage as ameaningful evaluation metric.
More generally, we argue against evaluation metrics that do nottake into account accuracy.
We propose to use variance of accuracy across sentences (andmore generally across corpora) as a measure for robustness.12
