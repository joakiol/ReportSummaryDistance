It deals with thedesignation of the size and structure ofspeech samples according to radio andtelevision program features.
Secondly, itdiscusses annotation method of broadcastspeech with achievements made and sug-gested future improvements.
Finally, itpresents an attempt to describe the distri-bution of annotated items in our corpus.1 IntroductionSince the year of 2002, we?ve been engaged insetting up the Media Language Corpus aimed toprovide the language resources for the research-ers who are interested in broadcasting and televi-sion media language, for teachers and for re-searchers of presentation art.
Up till now, wehave established a 50 million word text corpusinvolving 40 million word television programtext corpora and 10 million word radio programtext corpora with 10 million annotated word cor-pora.
The work of this paper is to introduce aten-hour segmented and prosodic labeled broad-cast audio & video bimodal corpus that we builtjust now.Section 2 of this paper describes a method forselection of radio and television programs to re-cord according to program features on radio andtelevision stations.
Recording conditions are pro-posed to record a quality spoken language corpus.Section 3 is dedicated to annotation methods.Section 4 shows the distribution of syllables, ini-tials, finals and tones etc.
Finally, section 5 con-tains the conclusion and outlines of our futurework in this field.2 Corpus Information2.1 Corpus metadataFirst of all, we have to select radio and televisionprograms to record.
Since a broadcast bimodalcorpus should represent the real life usages ofspoken language in radio and television, the dif-ferences between radio and television, the differ-ences between central and local televisions, andthe categories of programs should all together betaken into account during the process of collect-ing.
The followings are the framework (.wavfiles & .mpeg files matched with .txt files) ofhead information (metadata) of broadcast audio& video bimodal corpus that has been collected:-----------------------------------------------------------No.

forthe contrastive studies of the prosodic features ofdifferent genres of broadcast language.
Hence,the selections of samples of the corpus mainlyinvolve monologues, dialogues or both.
As theperforming forms of radio and television pro-grams are getting more and more diverse, it isvery difficult to decide whether a program is amonologue or dialogue, because these two gen-res of programs often co-occur in one program.Furthermore, these kinds of programs are in-creasing their share of radio and television pro-grams.
Consequently, this kind of program ismost frequent in the corpus.

The recorded speech data are savedas 22 kHz and 16bit, Windows PCM waveform,the video data are saved as MPEG or WMV for-mat file by Ulead VideoStudio in a post-processing step.
Every program or segment ofprograms is composed of three parts: *.wavdata, *.txt data, and *.mpeg/.wmv data.Zhao Shixia et al(2000) pointed out that thestructure of a speech corpus consists of synchro-nized objects (text files, wav files, and annotatedprosodic files), arranged in deep hierarchies (re-cording environment), and labeled with speaker-attribute metadata.
Therefore, the managed ob-jects of our broadcast bimodal corpus are inte-grated programs or segments of programs.
Alldata are stored separately but have complex logi-cal inter-relations.
These inter-relations can beobtained through the description of the programs.Figure 1 displays the logical structure of thebroadcast bimodal corpus.DatabaseDescribing fileof program 1Describing fileof program 2Describing fileof program nAudio &video dataText data Labeled data?Figure 1 the logic structure of broadcast audioand video bimodal corpus3 AnnotationWhy should we annotate a corpus?
An annota-tion is the fundamental act of associating somecontent to a region in a signal.
The annotationquality and depth have a direct impact on theutility and possible applications of the corpus(Ding Xinshan 1998).
The annotation of our cor-pus consists of transcription, segmental annota-tion, and prosodic annotation.3.1 Transcription and segmentationTranscription is primarily composed of pinyintranscription of Chinese characters.
Besides,tones are annotated ?1?, ?2?, ?3?, and  ?4?
afterthe syllable, the neutral tone is labeled ?0?
; final???
annotated as ?v?, and ??e?
annotated as ?ue?,for example, ??
(l?)?
annotated as ?lv3?, ??(n??)?
annotated as ?nue4?.In the utterance, compared with broken sylla-bles, successive speech alters greatly, due to theinfluence of co-articulation, semantics and pros-ody.
The purpose of segmental annotating is toannotate the altered phonemes in the syllablesamidst the utterance.
For instances, the voicingof some plosives (e.g.
b, d, g); labial?s influenceon alveolar nasal (e.g.
?-n?
in ?renmin?
affectedby the initial of ?min?
gradually change into?labionasal?
?demonstrating the similarities be-tween alveolar nasal and labionasal initial in thefrequency spectrum).
In the places of unapparentpauses, the stop in the front of plosives esp.
af-103fricates often vanishes, which are called the in-existence of silence.We transcription and segmentation we usedBSCA (Broadcasting Speech Corpus Annotator)which was designed by ourselves (Hu Fengguoand Zou Yu 2005).
An annotated example isshown in Figure 2:Figure 2 BSCA: a tool for annotation3.2 Prosodic annotation tiersProsodic annotation increases the utility of aspeech corpus.
An annotated speech corpus cannot only offer us a database for the research andexploration of speech information but can alsoenlarge our knowledge of speech and prosodicfeatures through a visual and scientific method.Prosodic annotation is a categorical descrip-tion for the prosodic features with linguisticfunctions, in other words, annotation of thechanges of tone, the patterns of stress, and theprosodic structure with linguistic functions.
Theprosodic labeling conventions are a set of ma-chine-readable codes for transforming speechprosodies and rule conventions.
Based on ToBI(Kim Silverman et al 1992, John F. Pitrelli et al1994) and C-ToBI Conventions (Li Aijun 2002),according to the practical needs of broadcastspeech language, the prosodic annotation mainlyinvolves labeling the following parallel tiers:break index, stress index, and intonation con-struction tier (Chen Yudong 2004, Zou Yu 2004).3.2.1 Break indices tierBased on Cao Jianfen?s (1999, 2001) categoriesof prosodic hierarchy structure combined withthe practical needs of broadcast speech, we iden-tified five break levels (0-4): 0 indicates the si-lence or the boundary of default internal sylla-bles amidst the prosodic words.
1 stands for theboundaries of the prosodic words including theshort breaks with silent pause and breaks withfilled pause.
The prosodic words are the funda-mental prosodic units in broadcast speech.
Sim-ple prosodic words are composed of 1~3 sylla-bles.
Complex prosodic words normally contain5~9 syllables, e.g., ?Shang4hai3 he2zuo4zu3zhi1?
(i.e.
the Shanghai Cooperation Organi-zation).
Break level 2 designates the boundariesof the prosodic phrases, most of which are ap-parent breaks with silent pause, and their patternsof pitch have also changed.
Break level 3 repre-sent the boundaries of intonational phrases, orthe boundaries of sentences.
Break level 4 standsfor the boundaries of intonation groups, similarto the boundary of the entire piece of news in anews broadcast, or of a talker turn in dialogue.At indefinite boundaries, the code ?-?
is addedafter the numbers.
The labels of the break tieroccurring times are shown in table 2:Table 2 the labels of the break tier occurring in 4hours annotated corporaBreak index Occurrence1 15122 29983 19864 7403.2.2 Stress indices tierStress is a significant prosodic feature.
In train-ing materials for broadcast announcers, emphasisis laid on labeling the stress on the basis of thepurpose of the utterance, the pattern and rhythmof stresses, and the changes of emotions.
ZhangSong?s (1983) classification of nuclear stressescan be the guideline for broadcasting productionand practice.
However, there are some shortcom-ings in his classifications, for instances, thevague hierarchies between the sentences and dis-courses.
This gets in the way of the formal de-scription of the stresses by the computers.
Never-theless, his theories on the judgment of primaryand minor stresses (i.e.
non-stresses, minorstresses, primary stresses etc.)
have some refer-ence value for stress annotations, because distin-guishing the hierarchies of stress is a crucialpractical problem for annotation.As to the problems with the hierarchies ofstress, most of the experimental phonetics andspeech processing researchers adopt Lin Mao-can?s (2001, 2002) classifications of stress hier-archies or some similar classifications.
That is tosay, the levels of stress include prosodic wordstress, prosodic phrase stress, and sentence stress(or nuclear stress) in Chinese.
According to reallife broadcasting productions, this paper identi-104fies four categories of stresses in broadcastspeech: the rhythm unit, the cross rhythm unit,the clause, and the discourse.
Among them, thediscourse stress often occurs at the place of anaccented syllable, but they are relatively moreimportant than the other sentence stresses.
Thelabeling methods of all the ranks are listed asfollows (Chen Yudong 2004):Table 3 the stress levels in the stress indices tierRanks LabelsRhythm unit 1Cross rhythm unit 2Clause  3Discourse 4Table 4 the stress levels?

It can display the changes of sentence in-tonation structures.
The annotation of the intona-tion construction is mainly to label the relation-ship of other syllables to the nuclear stress apartfrom prehead, dissociation etc.
For example:Table 5 the labels of the intonation constructiontier occurring in 4 hours annotated corporaLabels Description OccurrenceP Prehead 794H Head 2980N Nucleus 2400T Tail 1600W Weak in stress 2321D Dissociation 527Top Topic 269Conj Conjunction 87A sentence can have one nuclear stress, ormultiple nuclear stresses.Single nuclear stress: representing the fore-and-aft places of the nuclear stress, the steepnessof nuclear stress, and the length of nuclear stress.Examples are listed as follows:P-H-N-T;P-H-H-N;...
...Among the above examples, long nuclearsplitting type ?H-N-T-H-N?-T?, with the featuresof multi-nuclear ?H-N1-T-H-N2-T?
is greatlysimilar to multi-nuclear.
However, ?H-N-T-H-N?-T?
differs from multi-nuclear in its dependentgrammar unit.Multi-nuclear stress: The two or more nuclearstresses in a multi-nuclear sentence take the pat-terns of like independent sentence intonationconstructions, each with its own nucleus, pre-ceded by a head and optional prehead, and fol-lowed by a tail.
In other words, these relativelyindependent patterns already have the features ofrelatively independent intonation constructions,with the apparent features of ?prehead, head, andnuclear ending?.
This kind of nuclear stress oftenoccurs in relatively longer and more complexconstructions.
Intonation constructions can belabeled separately.
A case in point is the contras-tive sentence ?zai4 wen3 ding4 de0 ji1 chu3shang0, qu3 de2 bi3 jiao4 gao1 su4 de0 fa1zhan3?
(i.e.
It got a comparative high-speed de-velopment on the stable conditions) that can beannotated as ?H-N1-T, H-N2-T?.
For example:Figure 3 the contrastive sentence ?zai4 wen3ding4 de0 ji1 chu3 shang0, qu3 de2 bi3 jiao4gao1 su4 de0 fa1 zhan3?(?????????????????
)3.3 Other items of annotationSome spoken language corpus can have someadditional annotation information.
For example,turn talking, paralinguistic and non-linguistic105information (e.g.
spot, background music, cough-ing, sobbing and sneezing) and some hosts?
ac-cents (e.g.
Shanghai accent) can be annotated intalk show corpus.
There are 82 times of spot and31 times of background music in 4 hours anno-tated data.
Furthermore, some .wav files, .mpegfiles can be annotated together for discourseanalysis.4 Distribution of annotated itemsWe conducted a statistic analysis of some an-notated items using 4 hours of annotated data inour corpus.The syllables (initials and finals) of the 20 topfrequent occurring are given in Table 6.
In addi-tion to this, the duration and variance distributionfor them are calculation shown as follows.Table 6 the mean of duration and variance of thetop 20 frequent occurring syllablesSyllable OccurrenceMean ofduration.

As for the F0 of each106tone, the F0 and pitch range of presentation styleis high and has big fluctuation; that of talk styleis high and has small fluctuation.
However, theF0 of tone 3 of presentation style is lower thanthat of reading and talk styles.5 Further studyThe broadcast audio and video bimodal corpus1is a presentation art-oriented corpus with radioand television news as its basis.
This paperprobes the development and compilation ofbroadcast audio and video bimodal corpus.Firstly, on the collection of the corpus, whatsort of audio and video corpus can represent thefeatures of radio and television speech language?How can we auto-annotate the audio and videocorpus?
...These are the problems that have al-ways been bothering us.Secondly, this corpus can be a platform forfurther research into non-accented or accentedsyllables, intonation construction, the prosodicfunctions of paragraphs and discourses, the emo-tions of speech, and genre styles.Finally, we can statistically analyze the spec-tral and prosodic characteristics of various speak-ing styles by the corpora, such as presentation,reading and talk.
All speaking styles would besynthesized based on the analysis results.
This isalso work for the future.6 AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Prof. Wolfgang Teu-bert for his guidance and comments on this paper.I would also like to thank Mr. Daniel Zhang, JanVan der Ven for their kind help.ReferencesCao Jianfen.
