Portable Software Modulesfor Speech RecognitionJohn ShoreEntropic Research Laboratory, Inc.600 Pennsylvania Avenue S.E., Suite 202Washington, D.C. 20003shore@ wrl.epi.com(Phase I SBIR grant from DARPA)Because speech recognition R&D is conducted in largepart through the creation and modification of computersoftware, productivity depends heavily on software en-gineering issues , the ease of writing new software andreusing existing software.
These issues are relevant notjust to the work within a particular R&D group, but also tothe exchange of technology among different groups.
Inparticular, technology transfer among speech recognitiongroups is inhibited by the lack of convenient and powerfulmeans for exchanging programs and d~t~:Under a Phase I SBIR grant from DARPA, Entropic willbegin the development of a new Speech Recognition Pack-age (SRP) using advanced software engineering tech-niques, including abstract interfaces, object-oriented pro-gramming, machine-independent numeric types, and self-describing objects.
These techniques have already beenapplied to speech and signal processing in two commercialproducts -- the Enu'opic Signal Processing System (ESPS)and waves+ (the ESPS graphics interface).
ESPS andwaves+ will be used as a technology base for the SRP.The Phase I effort will include an analysis of require-merits followed by the design and implementation ofprototype modules.416
