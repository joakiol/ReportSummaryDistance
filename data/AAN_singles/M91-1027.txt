MCDONNELL DOUGLAS ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS COMPANY :Description of the INLET System Used for MUC- 3David de Hilster and Amnon MeyersAdvanced Computing Technologies La bMcDonnell Douglas Electronics Systems Compan y1801 East Saint Andrew PlaceSanta Ana, California 92705-652 0e-mail : vox@young .mdc.comphone : (714)566-5956During the past nine months, our language processing effort has focused on implementin ga new NLP system called INLET.
INLET relies heavily on the methodology developed for th epreceding VOX system .
The goal of this work is to produce an NLP shell that can be customized t oa variety of tasks and domains .INLET provides user-friendly graphics-oriented tools for knowledge addition an dperusal, to support customization to a variety of domains and tasks .
INLET is implemented in Con Sun SPARCstations, in order to support faster analysis than Lisp-based systems and t oprovide a more widely usable end-product .At the present time, the basic knowledge addition system is in place, includin gvocabulary addition interfaces (e .g ., Figure 1), a dictionary book tool (Figure 2), a hierarch yeditor (Figure 3), and a grammar rule editor (Figure 4) .
A new Conceptual Grammar has beenimplemented for INLET, supporting concept hierarchies, a 'conceptual' dictionary, and othe rknowledge types (such as lexical interrelationships) .A conceptual analyzer, called the skimmer (Figure 5), has been implemented to provid erobust top-down language analysis capabilities.
The skimmer will augment a bottom-u panalyzer currently under construction .
A skimmer trace is shown in Figure 6 .DESCRIPTION OF THE SKIMME RThe skimmer, implemented in 2 months time, is the only operational component of theINLET analyzer (called LASS, for Language Analysis Support System) .
Six major processescomprise the skimmer, and are described in turn .
The first process performs a pass throug hthe input message to replace all fixed phrases with their atomic representation .
Fo rexample, the literal phrase "farabundo marti national liberation front" is replaced by a concep tthat represents that phrase .
The second process, called the pre-processor, locates and parse sspecialized constructs in the text, such as proper names, number words, temporal and locativ ephrases, as well as some domain-specific phrases dealing with perpetrators, physical, andhuman targets .
Phrases like "thirty-three", "Ricardo Alfonso Castellar", "three months ago" ,"San Miguel department", and "member of the FMLN", are all detected and parsed by the pre -processor.
Next, a pass through the text detects key words and phrases .
Words like"attack", "murder", and "bomb", as well as phrases like "set fire to object", "bomb damage dobject" are located in the text .
Incidents found in this pass are merged or segmented by th egrouping process .
Groups of sentences associated with a single incident are then examined bythe actor/object separation process to determine perpetrators and targets .
The subsequen t178slot filling process further examines groups of sentences to fill remaining slots of the MUC 3template .
In order to assure self-consistency in a single template, a semantic trimming andrejection process trims the templates prior to output .
This last process is ad hoc, bu tsubstitutes for our current lack of script-based processing .SAMPLE TEMPLAT E0.

EFFECT ON HUMAN TARGET(S) "A sample of the system's output for message 48 from TST2 is shown above .
The systemdid fairly well, successfully applying an apposition rule in slot 11, for example .
However,even though it found the appositive, it incorrectly assigned civilian type to the attorney general ,due to an undiagnosed bug .
The system often sloughs adjectives, e .g ., condensing "urbanguerrillas" to "guerrillas" in the perpetrator id slot .
Even though the first sentence of message48 says " .
.
.accused the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) of the crime", th eskimmer failed to fill the organization slot.
In this case, failure was due to lack of patterns fo raccusations .
Failure to find the instrument in " .
.
.was killed when a bomb placed by urba nguerrillas on his vehicle exploded" is due to the absence of a pattern like "bomb placed byactor".
Rather, the system knew the pattern "bomb BE placed by actor" where the verb 'to be' i snot optional .179DONAIII : (none )SER : (none)(Qo i t. )Ixurratml aANALYZ 10 : ..^ offChildren : O off(Add Vocabulary)recalculate Graph )VOCABULARY ADDITION(Next Word) (Cancel )concept WordRoot: guerrill aAdded :CONJUGATION SPresen t3rd person :Progressive :Pas tParticiple :Singular: guerrill aPlural: guerrillasEXTENDSYNTACTIC FEATURE SO adj0 auxO detnoun0 pro0 verbO advO c :onjO modal O prep0 quanO whSEMANTIC FEATURESFeature : terrorist/person/actor/objectFigure 1 : Vocabulary Addition Too lSER : (none)DONAIII : (none )(KBEditor)(Add Vocabulary)(Dictionary)(tent	 ool(Options((Sun(I' :)(Quit )10(Entire Graph )ANALYZ ID : e offChildren : Oaf(AddVocabulary)SFr.'
