Anumber of accompanying measures have also been put inmotion.
Work started in late 1992 and first results are expectedin early 1995.A substantial part of the LRE funds are devoted to applicationprojects ranging from full text retrieval through messageextraction, categorization and routing, software localization,foreign language reading aids, to automated translation ofsimplified texts and support ools for human translation.LRE actions on language resources include methods and toolsfor corpora, lexica and terminology collections.
Thedevelopment of a common software platform, ALEP, is currentlyreaching beta its testing phase.In order to favor the reuse of expensive language resources,LRE is promoting through the EAC~LES group consensus buildingamongst major European projects on a common resourceencoding scheme.Other action concern funding of industrial interest groups,namely in the area of controlled languages (e.g.
for product andmaintenance documentation) and full text retrieval.Finally, two small-scale international collaboration projectsare currently being supported by LRE, namely a state-of-the-artsurvey in Natural Language Processing and Speech incollaboration with the National Science Foundation and aproject on multi-lingual corpora.THE FUTURE: LANGUAGEENGINEERINGThe Language Engineering (LE) programme will be moreimportant than LRE and give a major new focus to initiatives inthe area of natural language processing, speech technology, andmachine translation, previously dispersed over differentprogrammes.Pilot application projects will be the major means forstimulating collaboration between users, suppliers andresearchers.
Building on the successful LRE scheme, theseprojects will provide a more user-centered context andencourage a coordinated and market-driven approach to RTDtasks, and at the same time demonstrate and validate theintegration of language components within information andcommunications systems and services.While substantial resources will be devoted to selected short- tomedium-term objectives, support will be provided for longer-term endeavors, leading to more advanced and effectivetechnologies.The focus of the LE programme will also be on applicationprojects aiming at providing pilot systems and servicescovering areas relating to advanced document creation,translation and management, interactive information services,inter-personal communication a d language acquisition and use.Support actions will be carried on in the area of languageresources uch as corpora, lexica and terminology, softwaretools, and general research focused on the integration of NaturalLanguage and Speech processing.Continued support for standardization and validation actionswill be ensured, and include assessment, evaluation and benchmarking.Finally, accompanying measures will cover valorization anddissemination of R&D work, training, support for user andindustrial interest groups, and international collaboration.303
