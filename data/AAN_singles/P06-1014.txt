In this paper,we present a method for reducing thegranularity of the WordNet sense inven-tory based on the mapping to a manuallycrafted dictionary encoding sense hierar-chies, namely the Oxford Dictionary ofEnglish.
We assess the quality of the map-ping and the induced clustering, and eval-uate the performance of coarse WSD sys-tems in the Senseval-3 English all-wordstask.1 IntroductionWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is undoubt-edly one of the hardest tasks in the field of Nat-ural Language Processing.
Even though some re-cent studies report benefits in the use of WSD inspecific applications (e.g.
Vickrey et al (2005)and Stokoe (2005)), the present performance ofthe best ranking WSD systems does not provide asufficient degree of accuracy to enable real-world,language-aware applications.Most of the disambiguation approaches adoptthe WordNet dictionary (Fellbaum, 1998) as asense inventory, thanks to its free availability, widecoverage, and existence of a number of standardtest sets based on it.
Unfortunately, WordNet is afine-grained resource, encoding sense distinctionsthat are often difficult to recognize even for humanannotators (Edmonds and Kilgariff, 1998).Recent estimations of the inter-annotator agree-ment when using the WordNet inventory reportfigures of 72.5% agreement in the preparation ofthe English all-words test set at Senseval-3 (Sny-der and Palmer, 2004) and 67.3% on the OpenMind Word Expert annotation exercise (Chklovskiand Mihalcea, 2002).
These numbers lead us tobelieve that a credible upper bound for unrestrictedfine-grained WSD is around 70%, a figure thatstate-of-the-art automatic systems find it difficultto outperform.
Furthermore, even if a system wereable to exceed such an upper bound, it would beunclear how to interpret such a result.It seems therefore that the major obstacle to ef-fective WSD is the fine granularity of the Word-Net sense inventory, rather than the performanceof the best disambiguation systems.
Interestingly,Ng et al (1999) show that, when a coarse-grainedsense inventory is adopted, the increase in inter-annotator agreement is much higher than the re-duction of the polysemy degree.Following these observations, the main ques-tion that we tackle in this paper is: can we pro-duce and evaluate coarse-grained sense distinc-tions and show that they help boost disambigua-tion on standard test sets?
We believe that this isa crucial research topic in the field of WSD, thatcould potentially benefit several application areas.The contribution of this paper is two-fold.
First,we provide a wide-coverage method for clusteringWordNet senses via a mapping to a coarse-grainedsense inventory, namely the Oxford Dictionary ofEnglish (Soanes and Stevenson, 2003) (Section 2).We show that this method is well-founded and ac-curate with respect to manually-made clusterings(Section 3).
Second, we evaluate the performanceof WSD systems when using coarse-grained senseinventories (Section 4).
We conclude the paperwith an account of related work (Section 5), andsome final remarks (Section 6).105106107108109110111112
