This paper presentsthe experiments carried out by the OpAL teamfor the participation in the SemEval 2010 Task18 ?
Disambiguation of Sentiment AmbiguousAdjectives.
Our approach is based on three dif-ferent strategies: a) the evaluation of the polar-ity of the whole context using an opinion min-ing system; b) the assessment of the polarity ofthe local context, given by the combinationsbetween the closest nouns and the adjective tobe classified; c) rules aiming at refining the lo-cal semantics through the spotting of modifi-ers.
The final decision for classification is tak-en according to the output of the majority ofthese three approaches.
The method usedyielded good results, the OpAL system runranking fifth among 16 in micro accuracy andsixth in macro accuracy.1 CreditsThis research has been supported by Ministeriode Ciencia e Innovaci?n - Spanish Government(grant no.

PROMETEO/2009/119 and ACOMP/2010/288).2 IntroductionRecent years have marked the beginning and ex-pansion of the Social Web, in which people free-ly express and respond to opinion on a wholevariety of topics.
Moreover, at the time of takinga decision, more and more people search for in-formation and opinions expressed on the Web ontheir matter of interest and base their final deci-sion on the information found (Pang and Lee,2008).
Nevertheless, the high quantity of datathat has to be analysed imposed the developmentof specialized Natural Language Processing(NLP) systems that automatically extract, classi-fy and summarize the opinions available on theweb on different topics.
Research in this field, ofopinion mining (sentiment analysis), has ad-dressed the problem of extracting and classifyingopinions from different perspectives and at dif-ferent levels, depending on various factors.While determining the overall opinion on a mov-ie is sufficient for taking the decision to watch itor not, when buying a product, people are inter-ested in the individual opinions on the differentproduct characteristics.
Especially in this con-text, opinion mining systems are confronted witha difficult problem: the fact that the adjectivesused to express opinion have different polaritiesdepending on the characteristic they are men-tioned with.
For example, ?high price?
is nega-tive, while ?high resolution?
is positive.
There-fore, specialized methods have to be employed tocorrectly determine the contextual polarity ofsuch words and thus accurately assign polarity tothe opinion.This is the aim of the SemEval 2010 Task 18 ?Disambiguation of Sentiment Ambiguous Adjec-tives (Wu and Jin, 2010).
In the following sec-tions, we first present state-of-the art approachestowards polarity classification of opinions, sub-sequently describing our approach in the SemEv-al task.
Finally, we present the results we ob-tained in the evaluation and our plans for futurework.4443 State of the ArtSubjectivity analysis is defined by (Wiebe, 1994)as the ?linguistic expression of somebody?s opi-nions, sentiments, emotions, evaluations, beliefsand speculations?.
Sentiment analysis, on theother hand, is defined as the task of extracting,from a text, the opinion expressed on an object(product, person, topic etc.)
and classifying it aspositive, negative or neutral.
The task of senti-ment analysis, considered a step further to sub-jectivity analysis, is more complex than the lat-ter, because it involves an extra step: the classifi-cation of the retrieved opinion words accordingto their polarity.
There are a series of techniquesthat were used to obtain lexicons of subjectivewords ?
e.g.
the Opinion Finder lexicon (Wilsonet al, 2005) and opinion words with associatedpolarity.
(Hu and Liu, 2004) start with a set ofseed adjectives (?good?
and ?bad?)
and applysynonymy and antonymy relations in WordNet.A similar approach was used in building Word-Net Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004),starting from a larger set of seed affective words,classified according to the six basic categories ofemotion (joy, sadness, fear, surprise, anger anddisgust) and expanding the lexicon using paths inWordNet.
Another related method was used inthe creation of SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebas-tiani, 2005), using a set of seed words whose po-larity was known and expanded using gloss simi-larity.
The collection of appraisal terms in (Whi-telaw et al, 2005), the terms also have polarityassigned.
MicroWNOp (Cerini et al, 2007),another lexicon containing opinion words withtheir associated polarity, was built on the basis ofa set of terms extracted from the General Inquirerlexicon and subsequently adding all the synsetsin WordNet where these words appear.
Othermethods built sentiment lexicons using the localcontext of words.
(Pang et al, 2002) built a lex-icon of sentiment words with associated polarityvalue, starting with a set of classified seed adjec-tives and using conjunctions (?and?)
disjunctions(?or?, ?but?)
to deduce orientation of new wordsin a corpus.
(Turney, 2002) classifies words ac-cording to their polarity on the basis of the ideathat terms with similar orientation tend to co-occur in documents.
Thus, the author computesthe Pointwise Mutual Information score betweenseed words and new words on the basis of thenumber of AltaVista hits returned when queryingthe seed word and the word to be classified withthe ?NEAR?
operator.
In our work in (Balahurand Montoyo, 2008a), we compute the polarityof new words using ?polarity anchors?
(wordswhose polarity is known beforehand) and Nor-malized Google Distance (Cilibrasi and Vitanyi,2006) scores.
Another approach that uses the po-larity of the local context for computing wordpolarity is (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), who usea weighting function of the words around thecontext to be classified.4 The OpAL system at SemEval 2010Task 18In the SemEval 2010 Task 18, the participantswere given a set of contexts in Chinese, in which14 dynamic sentiment ambiguous adjectives areselected.
They are: ?|big, ?|small, ?|many, ?|few, ?|high, ?|low, ?|thick, ?|thin, ?|deep,?|shallow, ?|heavy, ?
|light, ?
?|huge, ??|grave.
The task was to automatically classify thepolarity of these adjectives, i.e.
to detect whethertheir sense in the context is positive or negative.The contexts were given in two forms: as plaintext, in which the adjective to be classified wasmarked; in the second for, the text was tokenizedand the tokens were tagged with part of speech(POS).
There was no training set provided.Our approach uses a set of opinion mining re-sources and an opinion mining system that isimplemented to work for English.
This is why,the first step we took in our approach was totranslate the given contexts into English usingthe Google Translator1.
In order to perform thistask, we first split the initial file into 10 smallerfiles, using a specialized program ?
GSplit32.The OpAL adjective polarity disambiguationsystem combines supervised methods with unsu-pervised ones.
In order to judge the polarity ofthe adjectives, it uses three types of judgments.The first one is the general polarity of the con-text, determined by our in-house opinion miningsystem - based on SVM machine learning on theNTCIR data and the EmotiBlog (Boldrini et al,2009) annotations and different subjectivity, opi-nion and emotion lexica (Opinion Finder, Mi-croWordNet Opinion, General Inquirer, Word-Net Affect, emotion triggers (Balahur and Mon-toyo, 2008b).
The second one is the local polari-ty, given by the highest number of results ob-tained when issuing queries containing the clos-est noun with the adjective to be disambiguatedfollowed by the conjunction ?AND?
and a prede-fined set of 6 adjectives whose polarity is non-1 http://translate.google.com/2 www.gdgsoft.com/gsplit/445ambiguous ?
3 positive - ?positive?, ?beautiful?,?good?
and 3 negative ?
?negative?, ?ugly?,?bad?.
An example of such queries is ?price highand good?.
The third component is made up ofrules, depending on the presence of specificmodifiers in a window of 4 words before the ad-jective.
The final verdict is given based on thevote given by the majority of the three compo-nents, explained in detail in the next sections:4.1 The OpAL opinion mining componentFirst, we process each context using Minipar3.We compute, for each word in a sentence, a se-ries of features, computed from the NTCIR 7data and the EmotiBlog annotations.
Thesewords are used to compute vectors of features foreach of the individual contexts:the part of speech (POS)opinionatedness/intensity - if the word isannotated as opinion word, its polarity, i.e.
1and -1 if the word is positive or negative, re-spectively and 0 if it is not an opinion word,its intensity (1, 2 or 3) and 0 if it is not asubjective wordsyntactic relatedness with other opinionword ?
if it is directly dependent of an opi-nion word or modifier (0 or 1), plus the po-larity/intensity and emotion of this word (0for all the components otherwise)role in 2-word, 3-word, 4-word and sen-tence annotations: opinionatedness, intensityand emotion of the other words contained inthe annotation, direct dependency relationswith them if they exist and 0 otherwise.We add to the opinion words annotated inEmotiBlog the list of opinion words found in theOpinion Finder, Opinion Finder, MicroWordNetOpinion, General Inquirer, WordNet Affect,emotion triggers lexical resources.
We train themodel using the SVM SMO implementation inWeka4.4.2 Assessing local polarity using GooglequeriesThis approach aimed at determining the polarityof the context immediately surrounding the ad-jective to be classified.
To that aim, we con-structed queries using the noun found before theadjective in the context given, and issued six dif-ferent queries on Google, together with six pre-defined adjectives whose polarity is known (33 http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~lindek/minipar.htm4 http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/positive - ?positive?, ?beautiful?, ?good?
and 3negative ?
?negative?, ?ugly?, ?bad?).
The formof the queries was ?noun+adjective+AND+pre-defined adjective?.
The local polarity was consi-dered as the one for which the query issued thehighest number of total results (total number ofresults for the 3 queries corresponding to the pos-itive adjectives or to the negative adjectives, re-spectively).4.3 Modifier rules for contextual polarityThis rule accounts for the original, most fre-quently used polarity of the given adjectives (e.g.high is positive, low is negative).
For each ofthem, we define its default polarity.
Subsequent-ly, we determine whether in the window of 4words around the adjective there are any modifi-ers (valence shifters).
If this is the case, and theyhave an opposite value of polarity, the adjectiveis assigned a polarity value opposite from its de-fault one (e.g.
too high is negative).
We employa list of 82 positive and 87 negative valence shif-ters.5  EvaluationTable 1 and Table 2 present the results obtainedby the OpAL system in the SemEval 2010 Task18 competition.

top 8 runs (macro accuracy)Since the gold standard was not provided, wewere not able to perform an exhaustive analysisof the errors.
However, from a random inspec-tion of the system results, we could see that alarge number of errors was due to the translation?
through which modifiers are placed far fromthe word they determine or the words are nottranslated with their best equivalent.6 Conclusions and future workIn this article we presented our approach towardsthe disambiguation of polarity ambiguous adjec-tives depending on the context in which they ap-pear.
The OpAL system?s run was based on threesubcomponents working in English ?
one assess-ing the overall polarity of the context using anopinion mining system, the second assessing thelocal polarity using Google queries formed byexpressions containing the noun present in thecontext before the adjective to be classified andthe third one evaluating contextual polarity basedon the adjective?s default value and the modifiersaround it.
The final output is based on the votegiven by the majority of the three components.The approach had a good performance, theOpAL system run ranking fifth among 16 runs.Future work includes the separate evaluation ofthe three components and their combination in aunique approach, using machine learning, as wellas a thorough assessment of errors that are due totranslation.ReferencesBalahur, A. and Montoyo, A.
