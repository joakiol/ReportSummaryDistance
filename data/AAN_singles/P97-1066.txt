Knowledge Acquisition from Texts : Using an Automat icClustering Method Based on Noun-Modif ier RelationshipHoussem Assad iElectricit4 de France - DER/ IMA and Paris 6 University - LAFORIA1 avenue du G4n4ral de Gaul le,  F-92141, C lamart ,  Francehoussem, assadi@der, edfgdf, frAbst rac tWe describe the early stage of our method-ology of knowledge acquisition from techni-cal texts.
First, a partial morpho-syntacticanalysis is performed to extract "candi-date terms".
Then, the knowledge ngi-neer, assisted by an automatic lusteringtool, builds the "conceptual fields" of thedomain.
We focus on this conceptual nal-ysis stage, describe the data prepared fromthe results of the morpho-syntactic analy-sis and show the results of the clusteringmodule and their interpretation.
We foundthat syntactic links represent good descrip-tors for candidate terms clustering sincethe clusters are often easily interpreted as"conceptual fields".1 In t roduct ionKnowledge Acquisition (KA) from technical textsis a growing research area among the Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS) research community sincedocuments containing a large amount of technicalknowledge are available on electronic media.We focus on the methodological spects of KAfrom texts.
In order to build up the model of thesubject field, we need to perform a corpus-basedsemantic analysis.
Prior to the semantic analysis,morpho-syntactic analysis is performed by LEXTER,a terminology extraction software (Bourigault et al,1996) : LEXTER gives a network of noun phraseswhich are likely to be terminological units and whichare connected by syntactical links.
When dealingwith medium-sized corpora (a few hundred thousandwords), the terminological network is too volumi-nous for analysis by hand and it becomes necessaryto use data analysis tools to process it.
The mainidea to make KA from medium-sized corpora a feasi-ble and efficient task is to perform a robust syntacticanalysis (using LEXTER, see section 2) followed by asemi-automatic semantic analysis where automaticclustering techniques are used interactively by theknowledge ngineer (see sections 3 and 4).We agree with the differential definition of seman-tics : the meaning of the morpho-lexical units isnot defined by reference to a concept, but ratherby contrast with other units (Rastier et al, 1994).In fact, we are considering "word usage rather thanword meanin\]' (Zernik, 1990) following in this thedistributional point of view, see (Harris, 1968), (Hin-dle, 1990).Statistical or probabilistic methods are often usedto extract semantic lusters from corpora in orderto build lexical resources for ANLP tools (Hindle,1990), (Zernik, 1990), (Resnik, 1993), o r  for au-tomatic thesaurus generation (Grefenstette, 1994).We use similar techniques, enriched by a prelimi-naxy morpho-synta~ztic analysis, in order to performknowledge acquisition and modeling for a specifictask (e.g.
: electrical network planning).
Moreover,we are dealing with language for specific purposetexts and not with general texts.2 The  morpho-syntact i c  ana lys i s  :the  LEXTER so f twareLEXTER is a terminology extraction software (Bouri-gault et al, 1996).
A corpus of French texts on anytechnical subject can be fed into it.
LEXTER per-forms a morpho-syntactic analysis of this corpus andgives a network of noun phrases which are likely tobe terminological units.Any complex term is recursively broken up intotwo parts : head (e.g.
PLANNING in the term RE-GIONAL NETWORK PLANNING), and expansion (e.g.REGIONAL in the term REGIONAL NETWORK) 1This analysis allows the organisation of all thecandidate terms in a network format, known as theXAll the examples given in this paper are translatedfrom French.504"terminological network".
Each analysed complexcandidate term is linked to both its head (H-link)and expansion (E-link).LEXTER alSO extracts phraseological units (PU)which are "informative collocations of the candidateterms".
For instance, CONSTRUCTION OF THE HIGH-VOLTAGE LINE is a PU built  with the cand idate  te rmHIGH-VOLTAGE LINE.
PUs are recursively broken upinto two parts, similarly to the candidate terms, andthe links are called H'-link and E'-link.3 The  data  fo r  the  c lus ter ing  modu leThe candidate terms extracted by LEXTER can beNPs or adjectives.
In this paper, we focus on NPclustering.
A NP is described by its "terminologicalcontext".
The four syntactic links of LEXTER Can beused to define this terminological context.
For in-stance, the "expansion terminological context" (E-terminological context) of a NP is the set of the can-didate terms appearing in the expansion of the morecomplex candidate term containing the current NPin head position.
For example, the candidate terms(NATIONAL NETWORK, REGIONAL NETWORK, DIS-PATCHING NETWORK) give the context (NATIONAL,REGIONAL, DISPATCHING) for the noun NETWORK.If we suppose that the modifiers represent special-isations of a head NP by giving a specific attributeof it, NPs described by similar E-terminological con-texts will be semantically close.
These semantic sim-ilarities allow the KE to build conceptual fields in theearly stages of the KA process.The links around a NP within a PU are also inter-esting.
Those candidate terms appearing in the headposition in a PU containing a given NP could de-note properties or actions related to this NP.
For in-stance, the PUs LENGTH OF THE LINE and NOMINALPOWER OF THE LINE show two properties (LENGTHand NOMINAL POWER) of the object LINE; the PUCONSTRUCTION OF THE LINE shows an action (CON-STRUCTION) which can be applied to the objectLINE.This definition of the context is original comparedto the classical context definitions used in Informa-tion Retrieval, where the context of a lexical unit isobtained by examining its neighbours (collocations)within a fixed-size window.
Given that candidateterms extraction in LEXTER is based on a morpho-syntactical nalysis, our definition allows us to groupcollocation information disseminated in the corpusunder different inflections (the candidate terms ofLEXTER are lemmatised) and takes into account hesyntactical structure of the candidate terms.
For in-stance, LEXTER extracts the complex candidate termBUILT DISPATCHING LINE, and analyses it in (BUILT(DISPATCHING LINE)); the adjective BUILT will ap-pear in the terminological context of DISPATCHINGLINE and not in that of DISPATCHING.
It is obvi-ous that only the first context is relevant given thatBUILT characterises the DISPATCHING LINE and notthe DISPATCHING.To perform NP clustering, we prepared two datasets : in the first, NPs are described by their E-terminological context; in the second one, both theE-terminological context and the H'- terminologicalcontext (obtained with the H'-link within PUs) areused.
The same filtering method 2 and clusteringalgorithm are applied in both cases.Table 1 shows an extract from the first data set.The columns are labelled by the expansions (nominalor adjectival) of the NPs being clustered.
Each linerepresents a NP (an individual, in statistical terms) :there is a '1' when the term built with the NP andthe expansion exists (e.g.
REGIONAL NETWORK isextracted by LEXTER), and a '0' otherwise ("nationalline" is not extracted by LEXTER).NATIONAL DISPATCHING REGIONALLINE 0 1 0NETWORK 1 1 1Table 1: example of the data used for NP clusteringIn the remainder of this article, we describe theway a KE uses LEXICLASS to build "conceptualfields" and we also compare the clusterings obtainedfrom the two different data sets.4 The  conceptua l  ana lys i s  : theLEXICLASS softwareLEXICLASS is a clustering tool written using C lan-guage and specialised ata analysis functions fromSplus TM software.Given the individuals-variables matrix above, asimilarity measure between the individuals is calcu-lated 3 and a hierarchical clustering method is per-formed with, as input, a similarity matrix.
This kindof methods gives, as a result, a classification tree (ordendrogram) which has to be cut at a given level inorder to produce clusters.
For example, this method,applied on a population of 221 NPs (data set 1) gives2This filtering method is mandatory, given thatthe chosen clustering algorithm cannot be applied tothe whole terminological network (several thousands ofterms) and that the results have to be validated by hand.We have no space to give details about his method, butwe must say that it is very important to obtain properdata for clustering3similarity measures adapted to binary data are used- e.g.
the Anderberg measure - see (Kotz et al, 1985)50521 clusters, figure 1 shows an example of such a clus-ter.i .

Figure 1shows the transition from an automatically foundcluster to a conceptual field : the KE constitutesthe conceptual fields of "the structures".
He putssome concepts in it by either validating a candidateterm (e.g.
LINE), or reformulating a candidate term(e.g.
PRIMARY is an ellipsis and leads the KE to cre-ate the concept pr imary substat ion) .
The othercandidate terms are not kept because they are con-sidered as non relevant by the KE.
The conceptualfields have to be completed all along the KA pro-cess.
At the end of this operation, the candidateterms appearing in a conceptual field are validated.This first stage of the KA process is also the oppor-tunity for the KE to constitute synonym sets : thesynonym terms are grouped, one of them is chosenas a concept label, and the others are kept as thevalues of a generic attribute labels of the consideredconcept (see figure 2 for an example).l l i ne/ / conceptua l  f i e ld / /  : s t ruc ture//typell : ob jec t/ / l abe ls / /  : L INE,  ELECTRIC  L INE,OVERHEAD L INEFigure 2: a partial description of the concept "line"5 Discussion?
Evaluation of the quality of the clustering pro-cedure ?
in the majority of the works using clus-tering methods, the evaluation of the quality ofthe method used is based on recall and preci-sion parameters.
In our case, it is not possi-ble to have an a priori reference classification.The reference classification is highly domain-and task-dependent.
The only criterion that wehave at the present ime is a qualitative one :that is the usefulness of the results of the clus-tering methods for a KE building a conceptualmodel.
We asked the KE to evaluate the qualityof the clusters, by scoring each of them, assum-ing that there are three types of clusters :1.
Non relevant clusters.2.
Relevant clusters that cannot be labelled.3.
Relevant clusters that can be labelled.Then an overall clustering score is computed.This elementary qualitative scoring allowed theKE to say that the clustering obtained with thesecond data set is better than the one obtainedwith the first.LEXICLASS is a generic clustering module, itonly needs nominal (or verbal) compounds de-scribed by dependancy relationships.
It mayuse the results of any morpho-syntactic analyzerwhich provides dependancy relations (e.g.
verb-object relationship).The interactive conceptual analysis : in thepresent article, we only described the first stepof the KA process (the "conceptual fields" con-struction).
Actually, this process continues inan interactive manner : the system uses theconceptual fields defined by the KE to computenew conceptual structures; these are acceptedor rejected by the KE and the exploration ofboth the terminological network and the docu-mentation continues.Re ferencesBourigault D., Gonzalez-Mullier I., and Gros C.1996.
