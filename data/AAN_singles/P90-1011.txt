Performatives in a Rational ly Based Speech ActTheory*Philip R. CohenArtificial Intelligence CenterandCenter for the Study of Language and InformationSRI International333 Ravenswood Ave.Menlo Park, CA 94025andHector J. Levesque $Department of Computer ScienceUniversity of TorontoAbst rac t  1 IntroductionA crucially important adequacy test of any the-ory of speech acts is its ability to handle perfor-matives.
This paper provides a theory of perfor-matives as a test case for our rationally based the-ory of illocutionary acts.
We show why "I requestyou..
."
is a request, and "I lie to you that p" isself-defeating.
The analysis upports and extendsearlier work of theorists uch as Bach and Harnish\[1\] and takes issue with recent claims by Searle \[10\]that such performative-as-declarative analyses aredoomed to failure.
*This paper was made possible by a contract fromATR International to SRI International, by a gift fromthe Systems Development Foundation, and by a grantfrom the Natural Sciences and Engineering ResearchCouncil of Canada.
The views and conclusions con-tained in this document axe those of the authors andshould not be interpreted as representative of the of-ficial policies, either expressed or implied, of ATR In-ternational, the Systems Development Foundation, orthe Canadian government.t Fellow of the Canadian Institute for AdvancedResearch.There is something special about performativesentences, entences such as "I promise to return":uttering them makes them true.
How and whenis this possible?
Not all verbs can be uttered inthe first-person present tense and thereby makethe sentence true.
In general, the successful verbsseem to correspond to those naming illocution-ary acts, but not to perlocutionary ones such as"frighten."
But, even some illocutionary verbscannot be used performatively: e.g., "I lie to youthat I didn't steal your watch" is self-defeating\[12\].
So, which verbs can be use performatively,and in Searle's words \[10\], "how do performativeswork?
"Any theory of illocutionary acts needs to pro-vide a solution to questions uch as these.
But,such questions are not merely of theoretical in-terest.
Natural language database question-answering systems have been known to receiveperformative utterances \[14\], dialogue systemsthat recognize illocutionary acts (e.g., \[6\]) willneed to infer the correct illocutionary force tofunction properly, dialogue translation systems \[5\]will have to cope with markers of illocutionary79force that function performatively (e.g., sentencefinal particles in Japanese), and proposals for"agent-oriented programming languages" \[7, 13\],as well as Winograd and Flores' \[15\] COORDINA-TOR system, are based on performative communi-cation.
For all these systems, it is important ounderstand the semantics and pragmatics of suchcommunicative acts, especially their intended ef-fects.
To do so, one needs a full theory of il-locutionary acts, and a formal theory that pre-dicts how utterances can be made true by utteringthem.The currently accepted theory of performativesis that they are in fact assertions, hence true orfalse, and additionally constitute the performanceof the named illocutionary act, in the same wayas an indirect reading of an illocutionary act isobtained from the direct illocutionary act.
Thatis, the named illocutionary act is derived from theassertion as an indirect speech act.
The most com-pelling defense of this performative-as-assertionanalysis that we are aware is that of Bach and Har-nish \[1\], who address many of the linguistic phe-nomena discussed by Sadock \[9\], but who, we be-lieve, have misanalyzed indirect speech acts.
How-ever, in a recent paper, Searle \[10\] forcefully crit-icizes the performative-as-assertion approach onthe following grounds:?
Assertions commit the speaker to the truthof what is asserted?
Performative statements are self-referential?
"An essential feature of any illocutionary actis the intention to perform that act"Searle claims that accounts based on self-referential assertions are "doomed to failure" be-cause one cannot show that being committed tohaving the intention to be performing the namedillocutionary act entails that one in fact has thatintention.
Moreover, he questions that one shouldderive the named illocutionary act from an asser-tion, rather than vice-versa.
However, Searle hasimparted into Bach and Harnish's theory his no-tion of assertions as commitments to the truthwithout providing a precise analysis of commit-ment.
What may be doomed to failure is any at-tempt to base an analysis of performatives on sucha theory of assertions.This paper provides a formal analysis of per-formatives that treats them as declarative utter-ances, not initially as assertions, does not succumbto Searle's criticisms, and does not require an en-tirely new class of illocutionary acts (the "dec-larations") as Searle and Vanderveken \[12\] haveproposed.
The analysis is offered as another ade-quacy criterion for our theory of illocutionary acts.That theory, more fully explicated in \[3\], is basedon an analysis of the individual rational balanceagents maintain among their beliefs, goals, inten-tions, commitments, and actions \[2\].As desiderata for the theory of performatives,we demonstrate hat the analysis meets two prop-erties:?
A sincere utterance of "I request you to openthe door" is both a request and an assertion,yet neither illocutionary act characterizationis derived from the other.?
"I lie that the door is open" is self-defeating.Briefly, the ability to capture performatives imet alost entirely because such utterances aretreated as indicative mood utterances, and be-cause illocutionary acts are defined as attempts.Since attempts depend on the speaker's beliefs andgoals, and these mental states are introspectablein our theory if a speaker sincerely says, for ex-ample, "I request you to open the door," he mustbelieve he did the act with the requisite beliefs andgoals.
Hence, the utterance is a request.To meet the desiderata we need first to present,albeit briefly, the theory of rational interaction,the treatment of declarative mood utterances, andthen the illocutionary act definitions for request-ing and asserting.
Finally, we combine the vari-ous analyses natural anguage processor's task bymaking explicit the intended word sense of the ac-tion, and by reducing the combinatorics inherentin determining the attachment of the prepositionalphrases.802 Abbrev ia ted  theory  o f  ra t iona lac t ionBelow, we give an abbreviated escription of thetheory of rational action upon which we erect atheory of intention.
The theory is cast in a modallogic of belief, goal, action, and time.
Further de-tails of this logic can be found in \[2\].2.1 SyntaxThe language we use has the usual connectives ofafirst-order language with equality, as well as opera-tors for the propositional ttitudes and for talkingabout sequences of events: (BEL x p) and (GOAL xp) say that p follows from x's beliefs or goals (a.k.achoices) respectively; (AGT x e) says that x is theonly agent for the sequence of events e; el _<as aysthat el is an initial subsequence of e2; and finally,(HAPPENS a) and (DONE a) say that a sequenceof events describable by an action expression a willhappen next or has just happened, respectively.Versions of HAPPENS and DONE specifying theagent (x) axe also defined.An action expression here is built from variablesranging over sequences of events using the con-structs of dynamic logic \[4\]: a;b is action composi-tion; a\[b is nondeterministic choice; a\[\[b is concur-rent occurrence of a and b; p?
is a test action; andfinally, a* is repetition.
The usual programmingconstructs uch as IF/THEN actions and WHILEloops, can easily be formed from these.
Becausetest actions occur frequently in our analysis, yetcreate considerable confusion, read p?
;a as "actiona occurring when p holds," and for a;p?, read "ac-tion a occurs after which p holds."
We use e asa variable ranging over sequences of events, and aand b for action expressions.We adopt the following abbreviations and do-main predicates.
(BEFORE a p) de___f (DONE p?
;a) z(AFTER a p) def= (HAPPENS a;p?
)def <~p -- =le (HAPPENS e;p?).
(LATER p) d~f = ~p A Op.1This differs from the BEFORE relation describedin \[3\], which is here labelled PRIOR.def Op = -~<>-=p.
(PRIOR p q) dej Vc (HAPPENS c;q?)
D3a (a < c) A (HAPPENS a;p?
).The proposition p will become true no later thanq.def (KNOW x p) = p A (BEL x p).
( IMPERATIVE s) means that sentence s is an im-perative.
(DECLARATIVE s) means that sentence s, a stringof words, is a declarative.
(MAIN-VERB s v), (TENSE s tense), (COMPLE-MENT s s'), (D-OBJECT s np), (SUBJECT s np),are all syntactic predicates intended to have theobvious meanings.
2(TRUE s e) means that sentence s is true with re-spect to some event sequence ?
(which we will sayhas just been done.
)(REFERS np x e) means that noun phrase np refersto thing x with respect o event e.(FULFILL-CONDS s ?
e') means that event ?
ful-fills the satisfaction conditions, relative to evente', that are imposed by sentence s. 3 For example,ifs is "wash the floor," e would be a floor-washingevent.2.2 Assumpt ionsThe model we are developing embodies various as-sumptions constraining beliefs and choices (goals).First, BEL has a "weak $5" semantics, and GOALhas a "system K" semantics.
4 Among the remain-ing assumptions, the following will be used in thispaper.
5Beliefs imply  choice:(BEL x p) D (GOAL x p).2Feel free to substitute your favorite syntacticpredicates.3TRUE REFERS, and FULFILL-CONDS are justplaceholders for semantic theories of truth, reference,and the meanings of imperatives, respectively.
Theirlast event arguments would be used only in the inter-pretation of indexica\]s.4See other work of ours \[2\] for a full model theory.5In other words, we only deal with semantic struc-tures where these propositions come out true.81This means that agents choose amongst worldsthat are compatible with their beliefs.Goals are  known:I:::(GOAL x p) - (BEL x (GOAL x p)).Memory :p (DONE x (BEL x p)?
;e) =(BEE x (DONE x (BEE x p)?
;e)).That is, agents remember what their beliefs were.3 Ind iv idua l  Commitments  and  In -tent ionsTo capture one grade of commitment that an agentmight have toward his goals, we define a persistentgoal, P-GOAL, to be one that the agent will notgive up until he thinks certain conditions are sat-isfied.
Specifically, we haveDef in i t ion 1 (P-GOAL x p q) def=(1) (BEt x -~p) ^(2) (GOAL x (LATER p)) A(3) \[KNOW x(PRIOR \[(BEL x p)V(BEL x n-~p)v(eEL x "-,q)\]-~\[GOAL x (LATER p)\])\].That is, the agent x believes p is currently false,chooses that it be true later, and knows that beforeabandoning that choice, he must either believe itis true, believe it never will be true, or believe q,an escape clause (used to model subgoals, reasons,etc.)
is false.Intention is a species of persistent goal.
Weanalyze two kinds of intentions, those to do ac-tions and those to achieve propositions.
Accord-ingly, we define INTEND1 and INTEND2 to takeaction expressions and propositions as arguments,respectively.Def in i t ion  2 Intention:def (INTEND1 x a q) =(P-GOAL x \[DONE x (BEL x (HAPPENS a))?
;a\] q).
(INTEND~ x p q) def=(P-GOAL x3e\[HAPPENS x(BEE x 3e' (HAPPENS x e';p?))?
;e;p?\]q)Intending to do an action a or achieve a proposi-tion p is a special kind of commitment (i.e., per-sistent goal) to having done the action a or havingachieved p.?
However, it is not a simple commit-ment to having done a or e;p?
for that would al-low the agent o be committed to doing somethingaccidentally or unknowingly.
Instead, we requirethat the agent be committed to arriving at a statein which he believes he is about to do the intendedaction next.This completes a brief discussion of the founda-tional theory of intention and commitment.
Next,we proceed to define the more specific conceptsneeded for analyzing communicative action.4 Ut terance  EventsWe begin the analysis of utterance events byadopting a Gricean correlation of an utterance'sfeatures (e.g., syntactic mood or sentence-finalparticles in Japanese) with the speaker's mentalstate, termed a "core attitude" in \[3, 8\].
Veryroughly, a declarative utterance $ will be corre-lated with the speaker's believing the uttered sen-tence is true, and an imperative utterance willbe correlated with the speaker's wanting the ad-dressee to do some action that fulfills the condi-tions imposed by the sentence.
Let us notate thesecorrelations as:DECLARATIVE =~ (aLL x (TRUE s e))IMPERATIVE =~ (GOAL x03# (DONE y e') A(FULFILL-CONDS s e' e)We formalize this notation below.Someone who thinks he is observing an utter-ance event will come to believe the speaker is inthe correlated mental state, unless he has otherbeliefs to the contrary.
For example, if the ob-server thinks the speaker is lying, he believes thatthe speaker does not believe the uttered sentenceis true.
But, because he may think the speakertakes himself to be especially convincing, the ob-server may still believe that the speaker thinks theobserver is deceived.
Hence, he would believe the6For simplicity, we omit here one condition fromthe definition of INTEND2 in \[2\].82speaker thinks that he thinks the speaker believesp.This type of reasoning can continue to furtherlevels.
In general, if an utterance is producedwhen there are no countervailing observer beliefsat a certain level of nesting, then the result willbe, at the given level of nesting, that the speakeris taken to be in the correlated mental state \[8\].To be able to state such conditions, we need tobe able to refer easily to what a person x believesabout what y believes about what x believes etc.,to arbitrary depths.
To do so, we use the notionof ABEL.Definition 3 (ABEL n x y p) de__f(BEL x (BEL y (BEL x ...(BEL x p ) .
.
.
)That is, ABEL characterizes the nth alternatingbelief between x and y that p, built up "from out-side in," i.e, starting with x's belief that p. Onthis basis, one can define unilateral mutual belief- -  what one agent believes is mutually believed - -as follows.Definition 4 (BMB x y p) def= Vn(ABEL n x y p)In other words, (BMB x y p) is the infinite conjunc-tion (BEL x p) A (BEL x (BEL y p)) ^... Finally,we define mutual belief and mutual knowledge asfollows.Definition 5 (MB x y p) dej (BMB x y p) A(BMB y x p).
(MKxyp)  de---fpA(MBxyp).Utterance vents can produce effects at any (orno) level of alternating belief.
For example, thespeaker may not be trying to communicate any-thing to an intended observer.
Illocutionary actswill be defined to require that the speaker intendto produce BM Bs.
In what follows, it is importantto keep in mind the distinction between utteranceevents and full-blooded communicative acts.4.1 Notat ion  fo r  Descr ib ing  Ut teranceEventsWe now provide a formal notation for this corre-lation of utterance form and the speaker's mentalstate as a kind of default axiom (cf.
\[8\]).
First, wespecify who is speaking (spkr), who is observing(obs, which includes the speaker and addressee,but also others), who is being addressed (addr),and what kind of sentence (s) has been spoken(indicated by q~).
We shall assume that everyoneknows that a given utterance is of a given syn-tactic type (e.g., declarative), that speakers andaddressees are observers, and that observers areknown by all to be observing.
7Definition 6 ~ =~ ~ de_/V spkr, obs, addr, e, s, n(KNOW obs (DONE spkr e) A(UTTER spkr addr s e) A (q~ s)) ^,-,(ABEL nobs spkr(BEFORE ?,-,(GOAL spkr\[AFTER ?
(KNOW addr(BEFORE ?
o~))\]) ) 2)(ABEL nobs spkr(BEFORE ?t~ A (GOAL spkr\[AFTER ?
(KNOW addr(BEFORE ?
a))\]) ))That is, ?
=~ ~ is an abbreviation for a quan-tified implication roughly to the effect that if anobserver obs knows that ?
was just done, where?
was an uttering to addressee addt of a sentences in syntactic mood q~, and obt does not believethat ?
was done when the speaker did not want theaddressee to come to know that the core speaker-attitude a associated with utterances of that typeheld, then obs believes that the speaker in factwanted the addressee to know that o~, and so he,the observer, believes that c~ held just prior tothe utterance.
The notation states that at eachlevel of alternating belief or which the antecedentholds, so does the consequent.
The symbol '=~'can now be understood as a textual-replacement"macro" operator.Since these correlations are of the formVnP(n) 2~ Q(n)), they imply VnP(n) D VnQ(n).7The case of unseen observers i  straightforward,but omitted here.83As we quantify over the positive integers indicat-ing levels of alternative belief, we can derive theconclusion that under certain circumstances, addrthinks it is mutually believed (in our notation,BMB'ed) that the speaker spkr wants addr to knowwas true.Notice that right after the utterance, we areconcerned with what mental state the observerthinks the speaker chose to bring about in the ob-server with that utterance.
That is, the conditionon utterance vents involves the speaker's wantingto get the observer to know something, Withoutthis temporal dimension, our performative analy-sis would fail.
The analysis of performatives willsay that after having uttered such a sentence, orwhile uttering it, the speaker believes he has justdone or is doing the named illocutionary act.
Typ-ically, prior to uttering a performative, the speakerhas not just performed that speech act, and so hewould believe his having just done so is false.
So, ifthe condition on utterance vents in Domain :Ax-iom 1A involved only what the speaker believedor wanted to be true prior to the utterance, ratherthan after, all performatives would fail to achievethe observer's coming to believe anything.We can now state the correlation between ut-terance form and a speaker's mental state as adomain axiom.Domain  Ax iom 1 Declaratives andImperatives:A.
~=DECLARATIVE =~ (BEL spkr (TRUE s e))B. I= IMPERATIVE :=~ (GOAL xO3e'(DONE y e') ^(FULFILL-CONDS s e' e)Below, we present our definitions of illocutionaryacts.
Further justification can be found in \[3\].5 I l locut ionary Acts as AttemptsSearle \[11\] points out that an essential conditionfor requesting is that the speaker be attempting toget the addressee to perform the requested action.We take this observation one step further and de-fine all illocutionary acts as attempts, hence de-fined in terms of the speaker's mental states.
At-tempts involve both types of goal states, GOAL(merely chosen) and INTEND (chosen with com-mitment), as noted below.de\] Def in i t ion 7 {ATTEMPT x e p q tl} =tI?
;\[(BEL x -,~p A ,,-q) A(INTEND1 x tl?;e;p?
(GOAL x Oq)) A(GOAL x Oq)\]?
; ?That is, an attempt o achieve q via p is a complexaction expression i  which x is the agent of event ?at time tl, and prior to e the agent believes p andq are both false, chooses that q should eventuallybe true, and intends, relative to that choice, that ?should produce p. So, q represents some ultimategoal that may or may not be achieved by the at-tempt, while p represents what it takes to makean honest effort.5.1 Def in i t ions  o f  Request  and Asser tTo characterize a request or, for that matter, anyillocutionary action, we must decide on the appro-priate formulas to substitute for p and q in the def-inition of an attempt.
We constrain illocutionaryacts to be those in which the speaker is committedto understanding, that is, to achieving a state ofBMB that he is in a certain mental state.
Below isa definition of a speaker's requesting an addresseeto achieve p.Definit ion 8 {REQUEST spkr addr ?

(INTEND~ addr p\[(GOAL spkr Op) A(HELPFUL addr spkr)\] )\])\]\]3e' (DONE adclr e';p?
)tl}That is, event ?
is a request at time tl if it isan attempt at that time to get the addressee to84achieve some condition p while being committedto making public that the speaker wanted: first,that p eventually be achieved; and second, thatthe addressed party should intend to achieve itrelative to the speaker's wanting it achieved andrelative to the addressee's being helpfully disposedtowards the speaker.The illocutionary act of asserting will be definedas an attempt o make the speaker's believing thepropositional content mutually believed.def Definit ion 9 {ASSERT spkr addr ?
p tl} ={ATTEMPT spkr addr ?\[BMB addr spkr(BEFORE e\[GOAL spkr(AFTER ?\[KNOW addr(BEFORE ?
(BEL spkr p))\])\])\](BMB acldr spkr (BEFORE e (BEL spkr p)))h}More precisely, assertions at time tl are definedas attempts in which to make an "honest effort,"the speaker is committed to getting the addresseeto believe that i t  is mutually believed that thespeaker wanted prior to the utterance that theaddressee would come to know that the speakerbelieved p held then.
That is, just like a request,an assertion makes public that the speaker wantsthe addressee to know what mental state he wasin.
Although he is committed to that, what thespeaker has chosen to achieve is not merely tomake public his goal that the addressee know whatmental state he was in, but to make public thathe was in fact in that state of believing p. Foran INFORM, the speaker would choose to achieve(KNOW addr p).6 Per fo rmat ivesTo illustrate how performatives work, we showwhen both assertions and requests can be derivedfrom the utterance of the performative "I requestyou to <do act>."
The important point to noticehere is that we have not had to add to our ma-chinery; performative utterances will be treatedexactly as declarative utterances, with the excep-tion that the content of the utterance will makereference to an utterance vent.6.1 Request  Repor tsLet us characterize the truth conditions of thefamily of declarative sentences "x requests y to(imperative sentence sl). "
Let s be such a sen-tence.
Let ct be 3el(DONE y el) A (FULFILL-CONDS s' ez e).
We ignore most syntactic con-siderations and indexicality for reasons of space.Domain  Ax iom 2 Present tense requestsJ= Vx, y, e, tl, (DONE h?
;e) ^(SUBJECT s ~) A (D-OBJECT s y) A(REFERS z x e) A (REFERS y y e) D(TRUE s e) - (DONE x {REQUEST x y e ~ t l})That is, if event ?
is happening and the sentence sis a present ense declarative sentence whose mainverb is "request," whose subject x refers to per-son x, and whose direct object Y refers to persony, then the sentence is true iff x is requesting theaddressee y to fulfill the conditions of imperativesentence s'.
A bare present (or present progres-sive) tense sentence is true when the event beingdescribed is contemporaneous with the event ofuttering it.
s This definition applies equally wellto "John requests Mary to ..
."
as it does when Iutter "I request you to ..
."
For the former, suchsentences are likely to be narrations of ongoingevents.
9 For the latter, the event that is happen-ing that makes the utterance true is the speaker'suttering of the sentence.By our definition of request, for x to requesty to achieve p, x has to attempt o get y to dosome action intentionally to fulfill the sentence s',by making that goal mutually believed betweenthem.
Thus, to say x requested y to do somethingis only to say that x had the right beliefs, goals,and intentions.SSearle \[10\] correctly points out that performativescan be uttered in the passive, and in the first-personplural.9We are ignoring the habitual reading of barepresent ense sentences because we do not have a se-mantics for them.856.2 Per fo rmat ives  Used  as RequestsNext, we treat performative sentences as declar-atives.
This means that the effects of utteringthem are described by Domain Axiom 1A.
Wesketch below a proof of a general theorem re-garding performative requests, with s being thedeclarative sentence"I request you to(imperativesentence  Sl) , and c~ being 3el(DONE addr el) A(FULFILL-CONDS S 1 e I e).
We take the utteringof a sentence to be a unitary utterance vent.Theorem 1 A Performative RequestI=V spkr, addr, e, n, tl,(MK spkr addr (DONE spkr tl?
;e) A(UTTER spkr addr e s)) A(BEFORE h?
;e(GOAL spkr\[AFTER tl?
;e(KNOW addr\[BEFORE tl?
;e(BEL spkr (TRUE s e))\])\])) Z)(DONE {REQUEST spkr addr e a t l})That is, we need to show that if the sentence "Irequest you to <imperative sentence>" has justbeen uttered at time tl sincerely, i.e., when thespeaker wanted the addressee to know that he be-lieved the sentence was true, then a direct requesthas taken place at tl.Proof sketch: Essentially, one invokes the do-main axiom for declaratives at the first level ofABEL, entailing that the speaker believes that hebelieves that he has just done a REQUEST.
Then,one expands the definition of REQUEST into anATTEMPT, and then into its parts.
The defini-tion of ATTEMPT is based on BEL, GOAL andINTEND, the first two of which are obviously in-trospectable.
That is, if one believes one has themone does, and vice-versa.
Hence, by the memoryassumption, the speaker actually had them priorto the utterance.
More critically, intending to actat time tl is also introspectable at time tl becauseagents know what they are doing at the next in-stant and because there is no time to drop theircommitment \[2\].
Thus, one can repackage thesemental states up into an ATTEMPT and then aREQUEST.6.3 Per fo rmat ives  Used  as Asser t ionsWe have shown that the speaker of a sincere per-formative utterance containing an illocutionaryverb has performed the illocutionary act named bythat verb.
Under somewhat stronger conditions,we can also prove that the speaker has made anassertion.
As before, let s be "I request you to<imperative sentence>.
"Theorem 2 Perforrnatives Used as AssertionsI::V spkr, addr, e, n, tl,(MK spkr addr (DONE spkr tl?

(BEL spkr (TRUE s e))\]\]This default condition says that before the ut-terance, the speaker believed there would be noaddressee belief after the utterance vent (at anylevel n) to the effect that prior to that event thespeaker did not want the addressee to come toknow that the speaker believed (TRUE s e).
GivenDomain Axiom 1A, and the fact that BEL entailsGOAL, this suffices to entail the definition of asser-tion.
Notice that whereas requesting was derivedin virtue of the content of the utterance, an asser-tion was derived by default assumptions regardinglack of belief in the speaker's insincerity.7 ' L ie '  is not  a per fo rmat iveSome illocutionary verbs such as "lie, .... hint, .... in-sinuate," cannot be achieved performatively.
Thefollowing analysis shows a general model for whysuch verbs naming covert acts cannot be perfor-matively achieved.A reasonable definition of lying is the followingcomplex action:86Definition 10 {LIE spkr addr e p} de__f(BEL spkr ~p)?
;{ASSERT spkr addr e p t l}That is, a lie is an assertion performed when thespeaker believes the propositional content is false.For "I lie to you that the door is open" to bea successful performative utterance, it would haveto be true that the utterance is a lie.
We wouldhave to show that the uttering of that declarativesentence results in a lie's having been done.
Moregenerally, we provide a putative statement of thetruth conditions of "x lies to y that <declarativesentence s'> ."
Call the main sentence s.Domain  Ax iom 3 Supposed Truth Conditionsfor Performative Lyingl:: Ve, x, y, tl, (DONE h?

Let the sentences be "I lie to you that <declarative sentence s'>.

"Proof Sketch: Assume that it is mutually be-lieved that the speaker has uttered declarativesentence s. Now, apply Domain Axiom 1A.
Byassumption, the first conjuct of the antecddentholds.
There are then two cases to consider.
First,assume (**) the second conjunct holds (say, atlevel n = 1), i.e., the addressee does not believethe speaker did not want him to know that he be-lieved s' was true.
In virtue of the supposed truthconditions on lying, spkr would have to have beenlying.
By expanding its definition, and using thememory and introspectability properties of BEI_,GOAl', and INTEND the addressee can concludethat, before the utterance, the speaker wanted himnot to know that the speaker believes that in ut-tering S, he was lying.
But, this contradicts theassumption (**).
Since the speaker in fact utteredthe sentence, that assumption is false, and the ad-dressee believes the speaker did not in fact wanthim to know that he believed the sentence wastrue.
This renders impossible the intentions to beachieved in asserting, which are constitutive of ly-ing as well.Now, assume (**) is false, so the addressee infact believes the speaker did not want him to knowthat s' was true.
Again, this immediately makesthe speaker's intentions in asserting, and hence ly-ing, impossible to achieve.
So, in neither case isthe utterance a lie.
If the addressee believes thespeaker is a competent speaker of the language,the speaker must have intended some other inter-pretation.8 Conclus ionRequesting works well as a performative verb be-cause requesting requires only that the agent hasmade an attempt, and need not have succeeded ingetting the hearer to do the requested action, oreven to form the right beliefs.
Some verbs can-not be used performatively, such as "frighten,"because they require something beyond a mereattempt.
Hence, such verbs would name actionexpressions that required a particular propositionp be true after the utterance vent.
When the ut-terance vent does not guarantee such a p, the useof the performative verb will not be possible.On the other hand, certain utterances (perfor-mative or not), when performed by the right peo-ple in the right circumstances, make certain insti-tutional facts hold.
So, when a clergyman, judge,or ship captain says "I now pronounce you hus-band and wife," the man and woman in questionare married.
In our framework, there would be adomain axiom whose antecedent characterizes thecircumstances, participants, and nature of the ut-terance event, and whose consequent asserts thatan institutional fact is true.
The axiom is justifiednot by the nature of rational action, but by the ex-istence of an institution.
Such utterances could be87made with a performative prefix provided such at-tempts are made into successes by the institution.This paper has shown that treating performa-tive utterances as declarative sentences is a vi-able analysis, in spite of Searle's criticisms.
Theperformative use of an illocutionary verb is self-guaranteeing when the named illocutionary actconsists in the speaker's making an attempt omake public his mental state.
In such cases, ifthe speaker thinks he has done so, then he has.However, we do not derive the named illocution-ary act from the assertion, nor vice-versa.
