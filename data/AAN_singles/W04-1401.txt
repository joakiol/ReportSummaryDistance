Corporate Language Resources in Multilingual Content Creation,Maintenance and LeverageElia YUSTEInstitute of Computational LinguisticsUniversity of ZurichWinterthurerstrasse 190CH-8057 Z?richSwitzerlandyuste@ifi.unizh.chAbstractThis paper focuses on how languageresources (LR) for translation (henceLR4Trans) feature, and should ideallyfeature, within a corporate workflow ofmultilingual content development.
Theenvisaged scenario will be that of a contentmanagement system that acknowledges thevalue of LR4Trans in the organisation as akey component and corporate knowledgeresource.1 IntroductionCorporations willing to go multilingual facetwo main difficulties, especially at the beginning.The first one is that many organisations are notacquainted with the processes behindinternationalising their many products,documents, web pages and database interfaceseffectively, so they opt to reduce the costs oflocalisation (and some even do not dare to step inand consequently remain monolingual).
Thesecond problem, which may derive from problemnumber one, relates to the fact that the corporationis then likely to end up hiring the wrongtranslation team or language service vendor afterpromising a top quality product1 quickly andinexpensively.Unfortunately, qualified and truly skilledcandidates for posts in translation, localisation,internationalisation, and language-related projectmanagement are very difficult to find.
Despite thegrowing competition among language service1 Translation (any form thereof, human, machine,technical, scientific, commercial, written, oral, etc.
)involves both process and product.
One should not putunder scrutiny just the latter and ignore the former.vendors and providers, the language industry isrelatively immature.
It is composed of younglanguage service companies that are highlyproject-driven.
The lessons learned in one projectmay be left behind and are often not assembled ina baseline knowledge solution to be retrieved andleveraged later.The fact that most companies, regardless ofwhether they outsource2 their translation jobs orhave their own inhouse language servicedepartment, pay little attention to the integration,reusability of and interaction with languageresources for translation (LR4Trans) within aproject, let alne from project to project,constitutes a less than desirable panorama for thecreation of corporate multilingual content.So far, the leverage of LR4Trans has beenlimited to translation memory systems, wherepreviously translated content is available to thetranslator through a software tool.
Thistechnology is not by any means new or highlysophisticated.
While insufficient attention hasbeen given to the integration of translationmemories with other language resources andtechnologies3 in the workflow, modes ofaccessing translation memory databases haveevolved from purely standalone to distributeddata, either synchronised with a central databaseor as a remotely4 accessed central database.2 Since the 1980s and 1990s, outsourcing oftranslation, as of many highly specialised businessprocesses, has become prevalent.
In an attempt tolower translation-mediated communication costs, mostactivities, even the application of translation memorytools, are managed outside the boundaries of thecorporate firewall.3 A good start for this, though, are Bruckner & Plitt2001 and M?gge 2001.4 This is the typical situation when outsourcing,whereby the content moves out of the source languageAs a result, translation memories have graduallybecome widely adopted and almost theindispensable tool of the trade.
Commercialproducers of translation memory packages claimthat, if properly used and maintained, they arevaluable corporate knowledge resources.The question is whether translation memoriesconstitute the only possible corporate languageresource containing corporate knowledge, orwhether there can be other components, agentsand processes that play an important role inmultilingual content as well.In the next section we would like to carefullyexamine the notion of knowledge in connectionwith those of LR4Trans and multilingual content.2 From theory to practice2.1 Language resources and KnowledgeThe breadth and depth of knowledge requiredtoday in order to perform a good quality technicalor specialised corporate translation relies upon apanoply of language resources (LR) in machine-readable form, which are self-created in thecorporation or purchased from external parties(sister organisations, domain-specific specialistgroups and societies, applied software andsolution companies, etc.).
In this panoply ofcorporate  LR4Trans, one may find domainspecific terminology, source and target languagedictionaries of corporation-dependant wordmeanings, source and target language structuresand rules, a corporate language stylesheet,appendix of phrases and expressions denotingcultural differences within a (multinational)corporation or when attempting global expansion,prescriptive and descriptive notes about thecorporation ?culture?, among others.All these resources contain precious corporateknowledge that should be taken into considerationand be made accessible to all corporate membersand partners accordingly.
Tagging or flagging theknowledge in those language resources will beextremely useful for optimising - on a constantbasis - not only the resources themselves but thewhole of the multilingual content productionprocess.
Tags or flags, normally called contentproperties, content attibutes or metadata, areaimed at retrieving a content unit when necessaryand preventing loss of content.
It is preciselythanks to these attributes, often visualised to thecontent repository into an external translation process,and then returns in one or more new languages ?
afurther challenge, especially if there is not yet aneffective content management system in place.user by means colours or other agreedconventions, that a content management systemcan manage content even if it moves acrossmultiple languages or sites.Capturing that knowledge will thus be helpfulwhen developing scalable and adaptiveapplications for managing corporate multilingualcontent.2.2 From LR4Trans to knowledgerepositories and content managementsystemsA corporate knowledge-geared multilingualcontent strategy is open to a varying degree ofautomation, in terms of not only linguisticprocessing but also in content transaction5operations, on the basis of the type ofdocumentation, business conditioning factors, etc.It usually combines tightly integrated translationtechnologies (and maybe other kind of humanlanguage technologies) with human specialistintervention, i.e.
unique6 language workprocesses, which have to be driven by highlyskilled linguists.This form of knowledge-based translation workaims to bridge the gap between low cost, pooroutput machine-only  translation and costly high-quality human-only translation.
Although thiscould be seen as a type of machine-aided humantranslation (MAHT), we would like to emphasisethe issue of knowledge, corporate knowledge inparticular, which precisely ought to be capturedinto the translation system?s knowledge base.This corporate knowledge base, characterisedfor being configurable and updatable, will detectand classify the knowledge present in thelanguage resources into: general knowledge,domain-specific knowledge and, knowledgespecific to each individual customer ordepartment within the organisation.The knowledge base will nonetheless be actingas a single repository with the following possiblefunctions7: automated identification of terms that5 Transaction costs can outweigh translation costs,especially when the creation and maintenance ofmultilingual content is required for e-learning or e-customer support.6 Ideally tailor-made and customisable, that is,conceived for the corporation or the client they work inor for.7 These functions will be linked to one another andcalled according to the stage of multilingual contentcreation we are in.
A function or component may becalled more than once within the multilingual contentare candidates for once-only translation; spottingof translation for terms from previously translated,aligned texts; semi- or automated creation ofdomain and/or customer-specific terminology,dictionaries and glossaries; creation and regularupdate of domain and/or customer-specificlanguage rules; implementation of domain and/orcustomer-specific translation memories; dynamicand integrative machine translation, making use ofcustomised dictionaries (lexicons) and languagerules; translation and edition application, ideallyincreasing ease of use by showing colour-codedaligned bi-texts (bilingual) or multi-texts(multilingual) with a context expansion featureand highlighting terminology; and, mostimportantly, automated and user-dependantfeedback of new knowledge into the knowledgebase.3 The envisaged scenario: workflows,content management systems, and agentsHaving the corporate knowledge base linked tovarious LR4Trans, as presented in section 2makes us think of a procedural and very agilemultilingual content workflow.
But let us examineit in greater detail starting to look at the simplestof workflows first (figure 1):Author: edit/approve ?
?Translator:feedback from author ?
?Figure 1.- Typical Workflow diagramTypically authors do not edit or approve contentfor translation.
The texts to translate, usually froman unstructured document collection, are handedover to the translator, who does translate withouthaving the chance to get feedback from theauthorship department.
There is neither anobvious use of language resources in machine-readable form nor a corporate knowledgedetection and exploitation strategy in operation.This poor production process will have negativeconsequences in terms of the quality of theproduct translation (e.g.
lacking consistency,production lifecycle.frequent content losses, etc.)
and costs,particularly in the long run.In order to streamline the procurement andmanagement of corporate multilingual content wepropose the following workflow (see figure 2 inthe appendix).
Its main assets would be an overallcorporate knowledge base linked to variousLR4Trans, as appropriate, and maintained by allagents8 intervening in the workflow, plus acontent management system, or CMS, that wouldreflect the business roles controlling theworkflow, data production and update flow, userroles and access privileges, costing rules, etc.In contrast to figure 1, the following featurescan be found in the workflow presented in figure2:?
Cyclic nature of content, frommonolingual to multilingual, and backto enhance and expand the first;?
Corporate content is traceable and itsstate and structure can be followed-upat all times;?
Authors are aware of what happens atthe other end, and so are capable of?writing for translation?, that is, editingor approving content that will be laterreceived by an audience or market ofanother language and culture.
In otherwords, the package of the content startsbeing taken care of from the beginning;?
Translators are connected with theauthoring department: the concepts ofcontent negotiation and feedback areessential here.
Translators, beingintercultural mediators, have a strongsay in issues of international contentrelevancy.SourceLanguageDocumentCollectionTRANSLATIONCMS are meant to work seamlessly in thebackground, automatically identifying changesin the content (e.g.
keeping track of the contentproduction or processing stage, keeping a log ofagent participation, etc.)
by means of a built-infeedback loop mechanism.
Besides, amultilingual CMS comes to live action when, assome kind of document gate keeper and donor,passes on the content from one agent to another,8 By this we mean not only the multiskilledcorporate linguist (who could be a translator,terminologist, editor, domain validator, cross-culturalconsultant...), but also all those agents that constructand share the knowledge of a corporation, namelydecision makers (i.e.
management force), marketeers,legal specialists, and so on.notifying him or her of any vital new piece ofinformation: ?a new translation has beenreceived?, ?glossary validated by expert XYand saved today at 18:27 hours?, ?not possibleto close up project before client acceptancytest?.CMS are usually dependant on the corporateknowledge base.
Together, they define theworkflow and have interaction capabilities withthe various users by means of secure interfaces,usually very similar to a web portal for internaland very often external use, too (mainly forworkers or at different sites and clients).Concerning language work, it is extremelyimportant that both online and offline editingand review of content are allowed.
In otherwords, the corporate knowledge base has to becentralised (online use) and yet distributed attimes (offline use).
It will be the system, whichwill manage the synchronisation of content andknowledge base alterations and updates acrossall the different user types.The CMS thus relies heavily upon automatedmechanisms (e.g.
automatic updating of thetranslation memory once the project translationshave gone through the review process) butneeds skilled human intervention to improve itsefficiency over time.4 ConclusionAfter introducing some commonplaceproblematic issues surrounding the creation,managing and leveraging of multilingual content,we have analysed the interrelation of corporateknowledge and language resources for translationin a corporate setting.
It has been argued that thecorporate knowledge residing in the corporationdocumentation and language resources has to becaptured and introduced in a corporate knowledgebase, which has to be made accessible to andconstantly cared for by all agents intervening inthe multilingual content workflow, not only bylinguists.
We have gone on to underline theimportance of having a content managementsystem in place, in order to account for anddynamise the tasks and processes within theworkflow.
Other relevant issues such as linkagebetween resources, knowledge base and CMS,and balance between automation and humanintervention have been discussed.5 AcknowledgementsMy special thanks go to the two blind reviewersof this paper?s first draft.
