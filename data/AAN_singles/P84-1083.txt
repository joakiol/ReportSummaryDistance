TEXTUAL EXPERTISE IN WORD EXPERTS:AN APPROACH TO TEXT PARSING BASED ON TOPIC/COMMENT MONITORING *Udo HahnUniversitaet KonstanzInformationswissenschaftProJekt TOPICPostfach 5560D-7750 Konstanz i, West GermanyABSTRACTIn this paper prototype versions of two wordexperts for text analysis are dealt with whichdemonstrate that word experts are a feasible toolfor parsing texts on the level of text cohesion aswell as text coherence.
The analysis is based ontwo major knowledge sources: context informationis modelled in terms of a frame knowledge base,while the co-text keeps record of the linearsequencing of text analysis.
The result of textparsing consists of a text graph reflecting thethematic organization of topics in a text.i.
Word Experts as a Text Parsing DeviceThis paper outlines an operational repre-sentation of the notion of text cohesion and textcoherence based on a collection of word experts ascentral procedural components of a distributedlexical grammar.By text cohesion, we refer to the micro levelof textuallty as provided, e.g.
by reference,substitution, ellipsis, conjunction and lexicalcohesion (cf.
HALLIDAY/HASAN 1976), whereas textcoherence relates to the macro level of textualityas induced, e.g.
by patterns of semantic recurrenceof topics (thematic progression) of a text (cf.DANES 1974).
On a deeper level of propositionalanalysis of texts further types of semanticdevelopment of a text can be examined, e.g.coherence relations, such as contrast, generaliza-tion, explanation (cf.
HOBBS 1979, HOBBS 1982,DIJK 1980a), basic modes of topic development, suchas expansion, shift, or splitting (cf.
GRIMES1978), and operations on different levels of tex-tual macro-structures (DIJK 1980a) or schematlzedsuperstructures (DIJK 1980b).The identification of cohesive parts of a textis needed to determine the continuous developmentand increment of information with regard to singlethematic focl, i.e.
topics of the text.
As wehave topic elaborations, shifts, breaks, etc.
intexts the extension of topics has to be delimitedexactly and different topics have to be relatedproperly.
The identification of coherent parts ofa text serves this purpose, in that the determina-tion of the coherence relations mentioned above* Work reported in this paper is supported byBMFT/GID under grant no.
PT 200.08.contributes to the delimitation of topics and theirorganization in terms of text grammaticalwell-formedness considerations.
Text graphs areused as the resulting structure of text parsing andserve to represent corresponding relatlons holdingbetween different topics.The word experts outlined below are part of agenuine text-based parsing formalism incorporatinga llnguistical level in terms of a distributed textgrammar and a computational level in terms of acorresponding text parser (HAHN/REIMER 1983; for anaccount of the original conception of word expertparsing, cf.
SMALL/RIgGER 1982).
This paper isintended to provide an empirical assessment of wordexperts for the purpose of text parsing.
We thusarrive at a predominantly functional description ofthis parsing device neglecting to a large extentits procedural aspects.The word expert parser is currently beingimplemented as a major system component of TOPIC, aknowledge-based text analysis system which isintended to provide text summarization (abstract-ing) facilities on varlable layers of informationalspeclfity for German language texts (each approx.2000-4000 words) dealing with information technol-ogy.
Word expert construction and modification issupported by a word expert editor using a specialword expert representation language fragments ofwhich are introduced in this paper (for a moredetailed account, cf.
HAHN/REIMER 1983, HAHN1984).
Word experts are executed by interpretationof their representation language description.TOPIC's word expert system and its editor arewritten in the C programming language and arerunning under UNIX.2 .
Some General Remarks about Word Expert Strut-ture and the Knowledge Sources Available forText Parsin~A word expert is a procedural agent incor-porating linguistic and world knowledge about aparticular word.
This knowledge is representeddeclaratlvely in terms of a decision net whosenodes are constructed of various conditions.
Wordexperts communicate among each other as well aswith other system components in order to elaboratea word's meaning (reading).The conditions at least are tested for twokinds of knowledge sources, the context and theco-text of the corresponding word.402Context is a frame knowledge base which con-tains the conceptual world knowledge relevant forthe texts being processed.
Simple conditions to betested in that knowledge base are:ACTIVE ( f ) : <---=>f is an active frameEISA ( f , f" ) : <--->frame f is subordinate or instance offrame f"HAS SLOT ( f , s ) : <===>frame f has slot s associated to itHAS SVAL ( f , s , v ) : <-==>slot s of frame f has been assigned theslot value vSVAL RANGE ( sir , s , f ) : <ffi==>--string sir is a permitted slot value withrespect to slot s of frame fCo-text is a data repository which keepsrecord of the sequential course of the textanalysis actually going on - this linear type ofinformation is completely lost in the context,although it is badly needed for various sorts oftextual cohesion and coherence phenomena.
Asco-text necessarily reflects basic properties ofthe frame representation structures underlying thecontext, some conditions to be tested in theco-text also take certain aspects of contextknowledge into accout:BEFORE ( exp , strl , str2 ) : <-=->strl occurs maximally exp many trans-actions before sir2 in the co-textAFTER ( exp , strl , str2 ) : <--->strl occurs maximally exp many trans-actions after str2 in the co-textIN  PHRASE ( str l  , str2 ) : <--->strl occurs in the same sentence as str2EQUAL ( strl , str2 ) : <--->strl equals str2FACT ( f ) : <==->frame f was affected by an activation op-eration in the knowledge baseSACT ( f , s ) : <-=->slot s of frame f was affected by an ac-tivation operation in the knowledge baseSVAL ( f , s , v ) : <--=>slot s of frame f was affected by the as-signment of a slot value v in the know-ledge baseSAME TRANSACTION ( f , f" ) : <--->--frame f and frame f" are part of the sametransaction with respect to a single texttoken, i.e.
the set of all operations onthe frame knowledge base which are car-ried out due to the readings generated bythe word experts which have been put intooperation with respect to this tokenFrom the above atomic predicates more complexconditions can be generated using common logicaloperators (AND, OR, NOT).
These expressions under-lie an implicit existential quantification, unlessspecified otherwise.During the operation of a word expert thevariables of each condition have to be bound inorder to work out a truth value.
In App.A and App.Bunderlining of variables indicates that they havealready been bound, i.e.
the evaluation of thecondition in which a variable occurs takes thevalue already assigned, otherwise a value assign-ment is made which satisfies the condition beingtested.Items stored in the co-text are in the fo rmatTOKENTYPEANNOTactual form of text wordnormalized form of text word after morpho-logical reduction or decomposition proce-dures have operated on itannotation indicating whether TYPE is iden-tified asFRAME a frame nameWEXP a word expert nameSTOP a stop word orNUM a numerical stringNIL an unknown text wordor TYPE consists of parametersframe .

CRITZ 1982; computational analysis of textualcoherence is also provided by HOBBS 1979, 1982applying a logical representation model).Word experts capable of handling correspondingtextual phenomena are given in App.A and App.B.However, only simplified versions of word experts(prototypes) can be supplied restricting theirscope to' the recognition of the text structuresunder examination.
The representation of thetextual analysis also lacks completeness skipping alot of intermediary steps concerning the operationof other (e.g.
phrasal) types of word experts (formore details, cf.
HAHN 1984).3.1 A Word Expert for Text CohesionWe now illustrate the operation of the wordexpert designed to handle special cases of textcohesion (App.A) as indicated by text segment \[i\].Suppose, the analysis of the text has beencarried out covering the first 9 text words of \[I\]as indicated by the entries in co-text:No.
TOKEN TYPE A~ ...................................................................{~I} In in  STOP\[e2} seinet sein STOP{~3} Grundversi~ - NIL{04} ist i s t  STOP{~5} der de~ STOP{g6} Mikrocomputer Mikroc~ter{07} mit mit  STOP{08} eine~ e in  STOP\[e9} Z-Be Z-88The word expert given in App.A starts runningwhenever a frame name occurs in  the text.
Startingat the occurrence of frame "Mikrocnmputer" indi-cated by {06} no reading is worked out.
At {09} theexpert's input variable "frame" is bound to "Z-80"as it starts again.
A test in the knowledge baseindicates that "Z-80" is an active frame (bydefault operation).
Proceeding backwards from thecurrent entry in co-text the evaluation of nodes#i0 and #Ii yields TRUE, since pronoun llst con-tains an element "ein" a morphological variant ofwhich occurs immediately before frame (Z-80) withinthe same sentence.
In addition, we set frame" to"Mikrocomputer" (micro computer) as it is nextbefore frame (with proximity left unconstrained dueto "any') in correspondence with {06}, and it is anactive frame, too.
The evaluation of node #12,finally, produces FALSE, since frame" (Mikrocom-purer) is not a subordinate or instance of frame(Z-80) - actually, "Z-80" is an instance of "Hik-roprozessor" (micro processor).
Following theFALSE arc of #12 leads to expression #2 whichevaluates to FALSE, as frame" (Mikrocomputer) is aframe which roughly consists of the following setof slots (given by indentation)MikrocomputerMikroprozessorPeripherieHauptspelcherProgrammierspracheSystemsoftwaremicro computermirco processorperipheral dev icesmain memoryprogramming languagesystem softwareFollowing the FALSE arc of #2, #3 also evaluates toFALSE as according to the current state of analysiscontext contains no information indicating thatframe" (Mikrocomputer) has a slot" to which hasbeen assigned any slot value (in addition, "Z-80"is not used as a default slot value of any of theslots supplied above).
Turning now to the evalua-tion of #4 slot" has to be identified which must bea slot of frame" (Mikrocomputer) and frame (Z-80)must be within the value range of permitted slotvalues for slot" of frame'.
Trying "Mikroprozes-sor" for slot" succeeds, as "Z-80" is an instanceof "Mikroprozessor" and thus (due tomodel-dependent semantic integrity constraintsinherent to the underlying frame data model{REIMER/HAHN 1983\]) it is a permitted slot valuewith respect to slot" (Mikroprozessor) which inturn is a slot of frame" (Mikrocomputer).
Thus,the interpretation slot" as "~tlkroprozessor" holds.The execution of word experts terminates if areading has been generated.
Readings are labels ofleaf nodes of word experts, so followlng the TRUEarc of #4 the reading SVAL ASSIGN ( Mikrocomputer ,Mikroprozessor , Z-80 ) i~ reached.
SVAL ASSIGN*is a command issued to the frame knowledge base (asis done with every reading referring to cohesionproperties of texts) which leads to the assignmentof the slot value "Z-80" to the slot "Mikroprozes-sor" of the frame "Mikrocomputer", This operationalso gets recorded in co-text (SVAL).
Therefore,entry {09} get augmented:?

~p{ 33 } das das STOP{ 34 } System System FR~At {34} the word expert dealing with text cohesionphenomena again starts running.
Its input variable"frame" is set to "System" (system).
With respectto #i0 the evaluation of BEFORE yields a positiveresult, since "das" which is an element of pronounlist occurs immediately before frame.
As theSWEIGHT INC (f, s) which is also provided inApp.A says that the activation weight of slots of frame f gets incremented.404IN PHRASE predicate also evaluates to TRUE, thewh~le expression #I0 turns out to be TRUE.Proceeding backwards to the next frame which isactive in the frame knowledge base search stops atposition {28}.
When more than a slngle framewithin the same transaction may be referred to byword experts the following reference convention isapplied:\[2i\]\ [2i i \ ]if ANNOT - FRAME and an annotation of typeFACT exists examine the frame correspondingto FACTif ANNOT - FRAME or ANNOT - WEXP and annota-tions of type SACT or SVAL exist examine fas frame, s as slot, and v as slot value,resp.
according to the order of parametersf .
s .
vIn these cases reference of word experts to theframe correponding to the annotation FRAME wouldcause the provision of insufficient or even falsestructural information about the context of thecurrent lexlcal item, although more significantinformation actually is available in the knowledgesources.
In the word expert considered, frame" isset to "Mikrocomputer" according to \[211\].
Follow-ing the TRUE arc of #ii expression #12 states thatframe" (Mikroeomputer) must be a subordinate orinstance of frame (System) which also holds TRUE.Thus, one gets the reading SHIFT ( System , M/k-rocomputer ) which says that the activation weightof frame (System) has to be decremented (thusneutralizing the default activation), while theactivation weight of frame" (Mikrocomputer) getsincremented instead.
Based on this re-asslgnmentof activation weights the system is protectedagainst invalid activation states, since "Mikrocom-purer" is referred to by "System" due to styllstl-cal reasons only and no indication is availablethat a real topical change in the the text isimplied, e.g.
some generalization with respect tothe whole class of micro computers.
We thus havean augmented entry for {34} in co-text togetherwith the result of processing the remainder of \[1\]:No.

With respect to other kinds ofcohesive phenomena in texts, e.g.
pronominalanaphora, conjunction, delxls, word experts areavailable similar in structure, but adapted toidentify corresponding phenomena.3.2 A Word Expert for Text CoherenceWe now examine the generation of a second typeof reading, so-called coherence readings, concern-ing the structural organization of cohesive partsof a text.
Unlike cohesion readings, coherencereadings of that type are not issued to the frameknowledge base to instantlate various operations,but are passed over to a data repository in whichcoherence indicators of different sorts are col-lected continuously.
A device operating on thesecoherence indicators computes text structure pat-terns in terms of a text graph which i s  the finalresult of text parsing in TOPIC.A text graph constructed that way is composedof a small set of basic coherence relations.
Weonly mention here the application of further rela-tions due to other types of linguistic coherencereadings (cf.
HAHN 1984) as well as coherencereadings from computation procedures basedexclusively on configuration data from the frameknowledge base (HAHN/REIMER 1984).
One common typeof coherence relations is accounted for in theremainder of section which provides for a struc-tural representation of texts which is alreadywell-known following DANES" 1974 d is t inc t ion  amongvarious patterns of thematic progression:SPLITTING THEWS (~RIVED YHE~)  SPLITTING RHEMESF'  l =~ STR l ?

Suppose, we have frame setto "Mikrocomputer" with respect to {06}.
Since #ifails (there is no other frame" available withintransaction {06}), evaluating #2 leads to theassignment of "Mikroeomputer" to frame" (withrespect to {09}), since according to convention\[21i\] and to the entries of co-text frame" (Mik-rocomputer/{09}) occurs after frame and isimmediately adjacent to frame (Mikrocomputer/06});in addition, both, frame as well as frame', belongto different transactions.
Thus, #2 is evaluatedTRUE.
Obviously, #3 also holds TRUE, whereas #4evaluates to FALSE, since frame" is annotated bySVAL according to the co-text Instead of SACT, asis required by #4.
Note that only the same trans-action (if #I holds TRUE) or the next transaction(if #2 holds TRUE) is examined for appropriateoccurrences of SACTs or SVALs.
With respect to #5the SVAL annotation covers the following parametersin {09}: frame" (Mikrocomputer), slot" (Mikroprozes-sot) and sval" (Z-80).
Proceeeding to the nextstate of the word expert (#6) we have frame (Mik-rocomputer) but no SVAL or SACT annotation withrespect to {06}.
Thus, @6 necessarily gets FALSE,so that, flnally, the reading SPLITTING THEMES(Mikrocomputer , Mikroprozessor , z-g0 ) --is gener-ated.A second example of the generation of acoherence reading starts setting frame to "RAM-l"at position {13} in the co-text.
Evaluating #1leads to the asslgment of "Mikrocomputer" toframe', since two frames are available within thesame transaction.
Both frames being different fromeach other one has to follow the FALSE arc of #3.Similar to the case above, both transaction ele-ments in {13} are annotated by SVAL, such that #7as well as #9 are evaluated FALSE, thus reaching#11.
Since frame (RAM-I) has got no slot to whichhas been assigned frame" (Mikrocomputer), #iievaluates to FALSE.
With respect to #13 we haveframe" (Mikrocomputer) whose slot" (Hauptspelcher)has been assigned a slot value which equals frame(RAM-l).
At #14, finally, slot (Groesse) and sval(48 KByte) are determined with respect to frame(RAM-l).
The coherence reading worked out isstated as CASCADING THEMES ( Mikrocomputer ,Hauptspelcher , RAM-I , Groesse , 48 KByte ).Completing the coherence analysis of textsegment \[I\] at last yields the final expansion ofco-text (note that both word experts describedoperate in parallel, as they are activated by thesame starting criterion):Jo.

PascWareThe word expert Just discussed accounts for asingle frame (here: M_Ikrocomputer) with nestedslot values of arbitrary depth.
This basic descrip-tion only slightly has to be changed to account forknowledge structures which are implicitly connectedinthe text.
Basically divergent types of coherencepatterns are worked out by word experts operatingon, e.g.
aspectual or contrastlve coherence rela-tions (cf.
HAHN 1984).4.
The Generation of Text Graphs Based onTop ic /Comment  Mon i to r ingThe procedure of text graph generation forthis basic type of thematic progression can bedescribed as follows.
After initialization bydrawing upon the first frame entry occurring inco-text the text graph gets incrementally con-structed whenever a new coherence reading is avail-able in the corresponding data repository.
Then,it has to be determined, whether its firstparameter equals the current node of text graphwhich i se l ther  the leaf node of the initializedtext graph (when the procedure starts) or the leafnode of the toplc/comment subgraph which has pre-viously been attached to the text graph.
Ifequality holds, the coherence reading is attachedto this node of the graph (including some mergingoperation to exclude redundant information from thetext graph).
If equality does not hold, remainingsiblings or ancestors (in this order) are tried,until a node equal to the first parameter of thecurrent coherence reading is found to which thereading will be attached dlrectly.
If no matchingnode in the text graph can be found, a new textgraph is constructed which gets inltlallzed by thecurrent coherence reading.
The text graph as theresult of parsing of the text segment \[i\] withrespect to the coherence readings generated inset.3.2 is provided in App.C.Note that the text graph generation procedureallows for an interpretation of basic coherencereadings supplied by various word experts in termsof compound patterns of thematic progression, e.g.as given by the exposition of splitting rhemes(DANES 1974).
Nevertheless, the whole procedureessentially depends upon the continuousavailability of reference topics to construct a406coherent  graph.
Accord ing ly ,  the ~raph generat ionprocedure a l so  operates  as a k ind ot  topic/commentmon i to r ing  dev ice .
Obvious ly ,  one a l so  has to takeinto account defective top ic /c~ent  patterns i nthe text under analysis.
The SEPARATOR reading isa basic indicator of interruptions of toplc/commentsequencing.
Its evaluation leads to the notion oftoplc/comment islands for texts which only par-tially fulfill the requirements of toplc/commentsequencing.
Further coherence readings are gener-ated by computations based solely on worldknowledge indicators generatingcondensed lists of dominant concepts (lists oftopics instead of topic graphs) (HAHN/REIMER 1984).5.
ConclusionIn this paper we have argued in favor of aword expert approach to text parsing based on thenotions of text cohesion and text coherence.
Read-ings word experts work out are represented in textgraphs which illustrate the topic/comment structureof the underlying texts.
Since these graphs repre-sent the texts" thematic structure they lend them-selves easily for abstracting purposes.
