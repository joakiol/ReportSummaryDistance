Assigning Time-Stamps to Event-ClausesElena FilatovaInformation Sciences InstituteUniversity of SouthernCaliforniaelena@isi.eduEduard HovyInformation Sciences InstituteUniversity of SouthernCaliforniahovy@isi.eduAbstractWe describe a procedure for arranging into atime-line the contents of news storiesdescribing the development of some situation.We describe the parts of the system that dealwith 1. breaking sentences into event-clausesand 2. resolving both explicit and implicittemporal references.
Evaluations show aperformance of  52%, compared to humans.1 IntroductionLinguists who have analyzed news stories(Schokkenbroek,1999; Bell,1997; Ohtsuka andBrewer,1992, etc.)
noticed that ?narratives1 areabout more than one event and these events aretemporally ordered.
Though it seems mostlogical to recapitulate events in the order inwhich they happened, i.e.
in chronological order,the events are often presented in a differentsequence?.
The  same  paper  states that ?it isimportant to reconstruct the underlying eventorder2 for narrative analysis to assign meaning tothe sequence in which the events are narrated atthe level of discourse structure?.If theunderlying event structure cannot bereconstructed, it may well be impossible tounderstand the narrative at all, let alne assignmeaning to its structure?.Several psycholinguistic experiments showthe influence of event-arrangement in newsstories on the ease of comprehension by readers.Duszak (1991) had readers reconstruct a newsstory from the randomized sentences.
Accordingto his experiments readers have a default strategyby which?in the absence of cues to thecontrary?they re-impose chronological order onevents in the discourse.1 Schokkenbroek (1999) uses the term narrative for newsstories that relate more than one event.2 i.e., chronological order.The problem of reconstructing thechronological order of events becomes morecomplicated if we have to deal with separatenews stories, written at different times anddescribing the development of some situation, asis the case for multidocument summarization.By judicious definition, one can make thisproblem easy or hard.
Selecting only specificitems to assign time-points to, and thenmeasuring correctness on them alone, may givehigh performance but leave much of the textunassigned.
We address the problem ofassigning a time-point to every clause in the text.Our approach is to break the news stories intotheir constituent events and to assign time-stamps?either time-points or time-intervals?tothese events.
When assigning time-stamps weanalyze both implicit time references (mainlythrough the tense system) and explicit ones(temporal adverbials) such as ?on Monday?, ?in1998?, etc.
The result of the work is a prototypeprogram which takes as input set of news storiesbroken into separate sentences and produces asoutput a text that combines all the events from allthe articles, organized in chronological order.2 DataAs data we used a set of news stories about anearthquake in Afghanistan that occurred at theend of May in 1998.
These news stories weretaken from CNN, ABC, and APW websites forthe DUC-2000 meeting.
The stories were allwritten within one week.
Some of the texts werewritten on the same day.
In addition to adescription of the May earthquake, these textscontain references to another earthquake thatoccurred in the same region in February 1998.3 Identifying EventsTo divide sentences into event-clauses we useCONTEX (Hermjakob, 1997), a parser thatproduces a syntactic parse tree augmented withsemantic labels.
CONTEX uses machinelearning techniques to induce a grammar from agiven treebanks.
A sample output of CONTEXis given in Appendix 1.To divide a sentence into event-clauses theparse tree output by CONTEX is analyzed fromleft to right (root to leaf).
The ::CAT field foreach node provides the necessary informationabout whether the node under considerationforms a part of its upper level event or whether itintroduces a new event.
::CAT features thatindicate new events are: S-CLAUSE, S-SNT, S-SUB-CLAUSE, S-PART-CLAUSE, S-REL-CLAUSE.
These features mark clauses whichcontain both subject (one or several NPs) andpredicate (VP containing one or several verbs).The above procedure classifies a clausecontaining more than one verb as a simpleclause.
Such clauses are treated as one event andonly one time-point will be assigned to them.This is fine when the second verb is used in thesame tense as the first, but may be wrong insome cases, as in He lives in this house now andwill stay here for one more year.
There are nosuch clauses in the analyzed data, so we ignorethis complication for the present.The parse tree also gives information aboutthe tense of verbs, used later for time assignment.In order to facilitate subsequent processing,we wish to rephrase relative clauses as fullindependent sentences.
We therefore have toreplace pronouns where it is possible by theirantecedents.
Very often the parser givesinformation about the referential antecedents (inthe example below, Russia).
Therefore weintroduced the rule: if it is possible to identifythe referent, put it into the event-clause:1.Russia <..> said;2.which <Russia> has loaned helicopters inprevious disasters;3.it <Russia> would consider sending aid.But sometimes the antecedent is identifiedincorrectly.Qulle charged that the United Nations andnon-governmental organizations involvedin the relief were poorly coordinated,which was costing lives.Here the antecedent for which is identified as therelief, and gives which <the relief> was costinglives instead of which <poor coordination> wascosting lives.
Fortunately, in most cases our ruleworks correctly.Although the event-identifier worksreasonably well, breaking text into event-clausesneeds further investigation.
Table 1 shows theperformance of the system.
Two kinds ofmistakes are made by the event identifier: thosecaused by CONTEX (it does not identify clauseswith omitted predicate, etc.)
and those caused bythe fact that our clause identifier does tooshallow analysis of the parse tree.4 Time-stamperAccording to (Bell, 1997) ?time is expressed atdifferent levels?in the morphology and syntax ofthe verb phrase, in time adverbials whether lexicalor phrasal, and in the discourse structure of thestories above the sentence?.4.1 Representation of Time-points and -intervalsFor the present work we use slightly modifiedtime representations suggested in (Allen, 1991).Formats used for time representation:?
{YYYY:DDD:W}3 Used when it is possible topoint out the particular day the event occurred.
{YYYY1:DDD1:W1},{YYYY2:DDD2:W2}...Used when it is possible to point out severalconcrete days when the events occurred.?
{YYYY1:DDD1:W1}---{YYYY2:DDD2:W2}Used when it is possible to point out a range of dayswhen the event occurred.?
<<<{YYYY:DDD:W} Used when it is possible tosay the event occurred {YYYY:DDD:W} or earlier.?
>>>{YYYY:DDD:W} Used when it is possible tosay the event occurred {YYYY:DDD:W} or later.4.2 Time-points Used for the Time-stamperWe use two anchoring time points:1.
Time of the articleWe require that the first sentence for each articlecontains time information.
For example:T1 (05/30/1998:Saturday 18:35:42.49)PAKINSTAN MAY BE PREPARING FORANOTHER TEST.The date information is in bold.
We denote by Tithe reference time-point for the article, where i3 YYYY?year number, DDD?absolute number of the daywithin the year (1?366), W-?umber of the day in a week(1- Monday, ?
7- Saturday).
If it is impossible to point outthe day of the week then W is assigned 0.Recall = (# of event-clauses correctly identified by system) / ( # of event-clauses identified manually)Precision = (# of event-clauses correctly identified by system) / ( # of event-clauses identified by system)Textnumber# of clausesby human# of clausesby system#correctrecall precisionText 1 7 6 5 5/7 = 71.42% 5/6 = 83.33%Text 2 27 31 15 15/27 = 55.55% 15/31 = 48.38%Text 3 5 8 3 3/5 = 60% 3/8 = 37.5%Text 4 28 28 18 18/28 = 64.28% 18/28 = 64.28%Text 5 33 36 19 19/33 = 57.57% 19/36= 52.77%Text 6 58 63 36 36/58=62.07% 36/63 = 57.14%total 158 172 96 96/158 = 60.76% 96/172 = 55.81%Table 1.
Recall and precision scores for event identifier.means that it is the time point of article i.  Thesymbol Ti is used as a comparative time-point if thetime the article was written is unknown.
Theinformation in brackets gives the exact date thearticle was written, which is the main anchor pointfor the time-stamper.
The information about hours,minutes and seconds is ignored for the present.2.
Last time point assigned in the same sentenceWhile analyzing different event-clauses within thesame sentence we keep track of what time-point wasmost recently assigned within this sentence.
Ifneeded, we can refer to this time-point.
In case themost recent time information assigned is not a datebut an interval we record information about bothtime boundaries.
When the program proceeds to thenext sentence, the variable for the most recentlyassigned date becomes undefined.
In most cases thisassumption works correctly (example 5.2?5.3):5.2.1 In the village of Kol, hundreds of peopleswarmed a United Nations helicopter5.2.2 that <a United Nations helicopter>touched down three days after Saturday?searthquake5.2.3 <after Saturday?s earthquake> struck aremote mountainous area rocked three monthsearlier by another massive quake5.2.4 that <another massive quake> claimedsome 2,300 victims.5.3.1 On Monday and Tuesday, U.N. helicoptersevacuated 50 of the most seriously injured toemergency medical centers.The last time interval assigned for sentence 5.2 is{1998:53:0}---{1998:71:0}, which gives anapproximate range of days when the previousearthquake happened.
But the information insentence 5.3 is about the recent earthquake and notabout the previous one of 3 months earlier, which iswhy it would be a mistake to point Monday andTuesday within that range.Mani and Wilson (2000) point out ?over half ofthe errors [made by his time-stamper] were due topropagation of spreading of an incorrect event timeto neighboring events?.
The rule of dropping themost recently assigned date as an anchor point whenproceeding to the next sentence very often helps usto avoid this problem.There are however cases where dropping themost recent time as an anchor when proceeding tothe next sentence causes errors:4.8.1 But in February a devastating earthquakein the same region killed 2,300 people and leftthousands of people homeless.4.9.1 At the time international aid workerssuffered through a logistical nightmare to reachthe snow-bound region with assistance.It is clear that sentence 4.9 is the continuation ofsentence 4.8 and refers to the same time point(February earthquake).
In this case our rule assignsthe wrong time to 4.9.1.
Still we retain this rulebecause it is more frequently correct than incorrect.4.3 PreprocessingFirst, the text divided into event-clauses is runthrough a program that extracts all the date-stamps(made available by Kevin Knight, ISI).
In mostcases this program does not miss any date-stampsand extracts only the correct ones.
The only cases inwhich it did not work properly for the texts were:?
sentence 1.h1PAKISTAN MAY BE PREPARING FORANOTHER TEST.Here the modal verb MAY was assumed to be themonth, given that it started with a capital letter.?
sentence 6.24Tuberculosis is already common in the areawhere people live in close quarters and havepoor hygienehere the noun quarters, which in this case is used inthe sense immediate contact or close range(Merriam-Webster dictionary), was assumed to beused in the sense the fourth part of a measure oftime (Merriam-Webster dictionary).After extracting all the date-phrases we proceedto time assignment.4.4 Rules of Time AssignmentWhen assigning a time to an event, we select thetime to be either the most recently assigned date or,if the value of the most recently assigned date isundefined, to the date of the article.
We use a set ofrules to perform this selection.
These rules can bedivided into two main categories: those that workfor sentences containing explicit date information,and those that work for sentences that do not.4.4.1 Assigning Time-Stamps to the Clauseswith Explicit Date Information?
Day of the WeekIf the day-of-the-week used in the event-clause is the same as that of the article (or themost recently assigned date, if it is defined), andthere no words before it could signal that thedescribed event happened earlier or will happenlater, then the time-point of the article (or themost recently assigned date, if it is defined) isassigned to this event.
If before or after a day-of-the-week there is a word/words signaling that theevent happened earlier of will happen later thenthe time-point is assigned in accordance with thissignal-word and the most recently assigned date,if it is defined.If the day-of-the-week used in the event-clause is not the same as that of the article (or themost recently assigned date, if it is defined), thenif there are words pointing out that the eventhappened before the article was written or thetense used in the clause is past, then the time forthe event-clause is assigned in accordance withthis word (such words we call signal-words), orthe most recent day corresponding to the currentday-of-the-week is chosen.
If the signal-wordpoints out that the event will happen after thearticle was written or the tense used in the clauseis future, then the time for the event-clause isassigned in accordance with the signal word orthe closest subsequent day corresponding to thecurrent day-of-the-week.5.3.1 On Monday and Tuesday, U.N.helicopters evacuated 50 of the mostseriously injured to emergency medicalcenters.The time for article 5 is (06/06/1998:Tuesday15:17:00).
So, the time assigned to this event-clause is: 5.3.1 {1998:151:1}, {1998:152:2}.?
Name of MonthThe rules are the same as for a day-of-the-week, but in this case a time-range is assigned tothe event-clause.
The left boundary of the rangeis the first day of the month, the right boundaryis the last day of the month, and though it ispossible to figure out the days of weeks for theseboundaries, this aspect is ignored for the present.4.8.1 But in February a devastatingearthquake in the same region killed 2,300people and left thousands of peoplehomeless.The time for article 4 is (05/30/1998:Saturday14:41:00).
So, the time assigned to this event-clause is 4.8.1 {1998:32:0}---{1998:60:0}.In the analyzed corpus there is a case wherethe presence of a name of month leads to awrong time-stamping:6.3.1 Estimates say6.3.2 up to 5,000 people died from the May30 quake,6.3.3 more than twice as many fatalities as inthe February disaster.Because of February, a wrong time-interval isassigned to clause 6.3.3, namely {1998:32:0}---{1998:60:0}.
As this event-clause is a descriptionof the latest news as compared to some figures itshould have the time-point of the article.
Suchcases present a good possibility for the use ofmachine learning techniques to disambiguatebetween the cases where we should take intoaccount date-phrase information and where not.?
Weeks, Days, Months, YearsWe might have date-stamps where the wordsweeks, days, months, years are used withmodifiers.
For example5.2.1 In the village of Kol, hundreds ofpeople swarmed a United Nations helicopter5.2.2 that <a United Nations helicopter>touched down three days after Saturday?searthquake5.2.3 after Saturday?s earthquake struck aremote mountainous area rocked threemonths earlier by another massive quake5.2.4 that <another massive quake> claimedsome 2,300 victims.In event-clause 5.2.3 the expression three monthsearlier is used.
It is clear that to get the time forthe event it is not enough to subtract 3 monthsfrom the time of the article because the aboveexpression gives an approximate range withinwhich this event could happen and not aparticular date.
For such cases we invented thefollowing rule:Time=multiplier*length4; (in this case 3*30);Day=DDD-Time; (for years Year=YYYY-Time)Left boundary of the range=Day-round (10%(Day));(for years = Year - round(10%(Year)))Right boundary of the range =Day + round (10%(Day));(for years = Year + round (10%(Year)))For event 5.2.3 the time range will be{1998:53:0}---{1998:71:0} (the exact date of thearticle is {1998:152:2}).If the modifier used with weeks, days, monthsor years is several, then the multiplier used in (1)is equal to 2.?
When, Since, After, Before, etc.If an event-clause does not contain any date-phrase but contains one of the words ?when?,?since?, ?after?, ?before?, etc., it might mean thatthis clause refers to an event, the time of whichcan be used as a reference point for the eventunder analysis.
In this case we ask the user toinsert the time for this reference event manually.This rule can cause problems in cases where?after?
or ?before?
are used not as temporalconnectors but as spatial ones, though in theanalyzed texts we did not face this problem.4.4.2 Assigning Time-Stamps to the Clauseswithout Explicit Date Information4 For days, length is equal to 1, weeks?7, months?30.?
Present/Past PerfectIf the current event-clause refers to a time-point in Present/Past Perfect tense, then an open-ended time-interval is assigned to this event.
Thestarting point is unknown; the end-point is eitherthe most recently assigned date or the time-pointof the article.?
Future TenseIf the current event-clause contains a verb infuture tense (one of the verbs ?shall?, ?will?,?should?, ?would?, ?might?
is present in theclause) then the open-ended time-intervalassigned to this event-clause has the startingpoint at either the most recently assigned date orthe date of the article.?
Other TensesOther tenses that can be identified with thehelp of CONTEX are Present and PastIndefinite.
In the analyzed data all the verbs inPresent Indefinite are given the most recentlyassigned date (or the date of the article).
Thesituation with Past Indefinite is much morecomplicated and requires further investigation ofmore data.
News stories usually describe theevents that already took place at some time in thepast, which is why even if the day when theevent happened is not over, past tense is veryoften used for the description (this is especiallynoticeable for US news of European, Asian,African and Australian events).
This means thatvery often an event-clause containing a verb inPast Indefinite Tense can be assigned the mostrecently assigned date (or the date of the article).It might prove useful to use machine learnedrules for such cases.?
No verb in the event-clauseIf there is no verb in the event-clause then themost recently assigned date (or the date of thearticle) is assigned to the event-clause.4.5 Sources of Errors for Time-stamperWe ran the time-stamper program on twotypes of data: list of event-clauses extracted bythe event identifier and list of event-clausescreated manually.
Tables 2 and 3 show theresults.
In the former case we analyzed only thecorrectly identified clauses.
One can see thateven on manually created data the performanceof the time-stamper is not 100%.
Why?Some errors are caused by assigning the timebased on the date-phrase present in the event-clause, when this date-phrase is not an adverbialtime modifier but an attribute.
For example,1.
Estimates say2.
up to 5,000 people died from the May 30earthquake,3.
more than twice as many fatalities as inthe February disaster.The third event describes the May 30 earthquakebut the time interval given for this event is{1998:32:0}---{1998:60:0} (i.e., the eventhappened in February).
It might be possible touse machine learned rules to correct such cases.One more significant source of errors is thewriting style:1.
?When I left early this morning,2.
everything was fine.3.
After the earthquake, I came back,4.
and the house had collapsed.5.
I looked for two days and gave up.6.
Everybody gave upWhen the reader sees early this morning he orshe tends to assign to this clause the time of thearticle, but later as seeing looked for two days,realizes that the time of the clause containingearly this morning is two days earlier than thetime of the article.
It seems that the errors causedby the writing style can hardly be avoided.If an event happened at some time-point butaccording to the information in the sentence wecan assign only a time-interval to this event (forexample, February Earthquake) then we say thatthe time-interval is assigned correctly if thenecessary time-point is within this time-interval5 Time-line for Several News Stories and itsApplicationsAfter stamping all the news stories from theanalyzed set, we arrange the event-clauses fromall the articles into a chronological order.
Afterdoing that we obtain a new set of event-clauseswhich can easily be divided into two subsets?thefirst one containing all the references to theFebruary earthquake, the second one containingthe list of event-clauses in chronological order,describing what happened in May.Such a text where all the events are organizedin a chronological order might be very helpful inmultidocument summarization, where it isimportant to include into the final summary notonly the most important information but also themost recent one.
The output of the presentedsystem gives the information about the time-order of the events described in severaldocuments.6 Related workSeveral linguistic and psycholinguistic studiesdeal with the problem of time-arrangement ofdifferent texts.
The research presented in thesestudies highlights many problems but does notsolve them.As for computational applications of timetheories, most work was done on temporalexpressions that appear in scheduling dialogues(Busemann et al, 1997; Alexandresson et al,1997).
There are many constraints on temporalexpressions in this domain.
The most relevantprior work is (Mani and Wilson, 2000), whoimplemented their system on news stories,introduced rules spreading time-stamps obtainedwith the help of explicit temporal expressionsthroughout the whole article, and inventedmachine learning rules for disambiguatingbetween specific and generic use of temporalexpressions (for example, whether Christmas isused to denote the 25th of December or to denotesome period of time around the 25th ofDecember).
They also mention a problem ofdisambiguating between temporal expression andproper name, as in ?USA Today?.7 ConclusionBell (1997) notices ?more research is neededon the effects of time structure on newscomprehension.
The hypothesis that the non-canonical news format does adversely affectunderstanding is a reasonable one on the basis ofcomprehension research into other narrativegenres, but the degree to which familiarity withnews models may mitigate these problems isunclear?.
This research can greatly improve theperformance of time-stamper and might lead to alist of machine learning rules for time detection.In this paper we made an attempt to not justanalyze and decode temporal expressions but toapply this analysis throughout the whole text andassign time-stamps to such type of clauses,which later could be used as separate sentencesin various natural language applications, forexample in multidocument summarization.Text number Number of event-clauses identifiedcorrectlyNumber of time pointcorrectly assigned tocorrectly identified clausespercentage ofcorrectassignmenttext 1 5 4 80.00text 2 15 15 100text 3 3 2 66.67text 4 18 17 94.44text 5 19 17 89.47text 6 36 24 66.66Total 96 79 82.29Table 2.
