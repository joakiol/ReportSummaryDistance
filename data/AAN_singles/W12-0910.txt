We examinein particular lexical and syntactic character-istics of verbs and find common trends inthese languages as children?s ages increase,such as the prominence of general and poly-semic verbs, as well as divergences such asthe proportion of subject dropping.
We alsofind a correlation between the age of acqui-sition and the number of complements of averb for English.1 IntroductionIn this paper we report on a large scale investiga-tion of some linguistic and distributional patternsof verbs in child-produced sentences for two lan-guages, Portuguese and English.
We compare thecharacteristics that emerge for two languages that,in spite of similarities in terms of verb usages alsohave important differences, in particular in allow-ing subject pro-drop, and examine to what degreethese are reflected in the data.
This is particularlyrelevant given the sparseness (and in some caseslack) of the Portuguese data, in particular for cer-tain ages, which may not provide as clear indica-tions as the English data, but existing analysis forthe latter can also benefit the former and be usedto help assess results obtained for similar trendsfound in it.As such our work is related to that of Butteryand Korhonen (2007) who perform a large scaleinvestigation of the subcategorization frames inthe English corpora in CHILDES (MacWhin-ney, 2000), a database containing transcriptionsof child-directed and child-produced sentences,comparing preferences in child and adult lan-guage to provide support for child language ac-quisition studies.
These preferences are found us-ing large amounts of automatically annotated datathat would be otherwise too costly and time con-suming to manually annotate.At present, CHILDES contains data for morethan 25 languages including English and Por-tuguese.
For English, the corpora are currentlyavailable with annotations in raw, part-of-speech-tagged, lemmatized and parsed formats (Sagae etal., 2010) (Buttery and Korhonen, 2005) (Butteryand Korhonen, 2007).
Although there are similarinitiatives for other languages, like Spanish andHebrew (Sagae et al, 2010), for Portuguese, thereis a lack of such annotations on a large scale.
Inthis work we address this issue and automaticallyannotate the Portuguese corpora with linguisticand distributional information using a robust sta-tistical parser, providing the possibility of deeperanalysis of language acquisition data.Crosslinguistic investigations of child-produced language have also highlighted theimportant role of very general and frequent verbs,light verbs like go, put and give which are amongthe first to be acquired for languages like Englishand Italian as discussed by Goldberg (1999).
Inthis paper we compare patterns found in childverb usage in English and Portuguese, in one ofthe first large scale investigations of syntacticallyannotated child-produced Portuguese data.
Usingthis level of annotation we are able to examinepatterns in verb usage in particular in terms ofsubjects and complements.
Thus, this work isalso related to the that of Valian (1991) who founda subject pro-drop rate of around 70% for 2 to 3year old children in Italian, a pro-drop language,38and even a significant number of subject omissionfor English, which is not a pro-drop language.This investigation aims at producing a large-coverage profile of child verb usage that can in-form computational models of language acquisi-tion, by both reporting on preferences in child lan-guage as a whole and on a developmental level.This paper is structured as follows: in section 2we report on the resources used for this investiga-tion, and the results are discussed in section 3.
Wefinish with some conclusions and future work.2 ResourcesFor examining child-produced data we use theEnglish and Portuguese corpora from CHILDES(MacWhinney, 2000).
The English corpora inCHILDES have been parsed using at least threedifferent pipelines: MOR, POST and MEGRASP(available as part of the CHILDES distribution,the corpora are POS tagged using the MOR andPOST programs (Parisse and Normand, 2000)).In addition we use a version annotated with theRASP system (Briscoe et al, 2006), that tok-enizes, tags, lemmatizes and parses the input sen-tences, outputting syntactic trees and then addinggrammatical relations (GR) as described by (But-tery and Korhonen, 2005).
This corpus contains16,649 types and 76,386,369 tokens in 3,031,217sentences distributed by age as shown in Table 1.Table 1: Frequency of words and sentences by agein years in CHILDES for English and PortugueseAge English PortugueseWords (k) Sent (k) Words (k) Sent (k)0 4,944 130 0 01 12,124 604 7 22 19,481 1,367 8 13 17,962 468 0 04 16,725 249 1 615 3,266 121 38 16 782 19 47 17 1,088 63 56 18 12 5 56 1The Portuguese, CHILDES contains 3 corpora:(1) Batore?o, with 60 narratives, 30 from adultsand 30 from children, about two stories; (2)Porto Alegre with data from 5 to 9 year old chil-dren, collected both cross-sectionally and longitu-dinally; and (3) Floriano?polis with the longitudi-nal data for one Brazilian child: 5530 utterancesin broad phonetic transcription.0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 800.050.10.150.20.250.3noun (en) verb (pt) preposition (pt) noun (pt)(a) Portuguese0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 800.050.10.150.20.250.3verb (en) preposition (en) noun (en) verb (pt) preposition (pt) noun (pt)(b) EnglishFigure 1: Verbs in relation to other frequent Parts-of-speech in English (1b) and Portuguese (1a)The combined size of the Portuguese corporain sentences and words is in Table 1.
These wereannotated with the PALAVRAS parser, a robustparser, which has a reported accuracy of 99%for part-of-speech tagging, 96-97% for syntactictrees, and 91.8% for multiword expressions (Bick,2000)1.
The childes annotation were first normal-ized to deal with incomplete words and removetranscription annotations, and then automaticallylemmatized, POS tagged, parsed and assigned se-mantic tags for nouns, verbs and adjectives.3 Verbs in children dataTo characterize verb usage in each of these lan-guages we examined the distribution of verbsacross the ages in terms of their relative frequen-cies, the number of syntactic complements withwhich they occur, and looking at possible linksbetween these and age of acquisition, as reportedby Gilhooly and Logie (1980).Figure 1 focuses on the relative distributions ofverbs in relation to other frequent parts-of-speech:prepositions and nouns.
For both languages verbsaccount for around 20% of the words used, andthis proportion remains constant as age increases,with the exception of the discontinuity for years 31The PALAVRAS parser was evaluated using Europeanand Brazilian Portuguese newspaper corpora (CETENFolhaand CETEMPblico) composed of 9,368 sentences.390 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 800.050.10.150.20.25have say ir ser estar ter ver(a) Portuguese0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 800.050.10.150.2be get go have say ir ser estar ter ver(b) EnglishFigure 2: 5 most frequent verbs in Portuguese (2a)and in English (2b)to 5 due to the lack of data for children with theseages in the Portuguese corpora in CHILDES.Table 2: Verb types and tokens for English andPortugueseLanguage Types TokensEnglish 34,693 17,830,777Portuguese 62,048 888,234Table 2 shows the number of verb types and to-kens in these two languages.
Among these verbs,the top 5 most frequent verbs2 for each languageare: be, get, go, have and say for English and ir(go) ser (be) estar (be), ter (have) and ver (see)for Portuguese.
These correspond to very generaland polysemous verbs, and their relative propor-tions in the two languages remain high throughoutthe ages for children, figure 2.
The frequenciesfor English are consistent with those reported byGoldberg (1999) and the Portuguese data is com-patible with the crosslinguistic trends for relatedlanguages.In terms of the syntactic characteristics of verbsin child-produced data, we examine separately2The reported frequency for each verb is for the lemma-tized form, including all its inflected forms.0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 80.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9subj+verb (pt) only verb (pt)(a) Portuguese0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 800.20.40.60.81subj+verb (pt) only verb (pt)(b) EnglishFigure 3: Percentage of sentences of verb withand without subject in Portuguese (3a) and in En-glish (3b)the occurrence of subjects and other comple-ments in these languages, using the syntactic an-notation provided by the RASP and PALAVRASparsers.
In the RASP annotation (Briscoe, 2006)we search for 3 types of complements in English:a direct object (dobj), the second NP comple-ment in a double object construction (obj2) andan indirect PP object (iobj).
For Portuguese, wesearch the PALAVRAS annotation for the follow-ing types of objects: a direct (accusative) object(ACC), a dative object (DAT), an indirect prepo-sitional object (PIV) and an object complement(OC).3For subjects figure 3 shows the occurrences ofovert (subj verb) and omitted subjects (only verb)in sentences in relation to the total number ofverbs (verb) for the two languages.
These are asource of divergence between them as in the En-glish data most of the verb usages consistentlyhave an overt subject, and only around 10-20%omit the subject, but these tend to occur less as theage increases, with a peak for 2 year old children.In Portuguese, on the other hand, initially most ofthe verb usages omit the subject, and only later3http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/visl/pt/info/symbolset-manual.html400 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 800.20.40.60.810NP (pt) 1NP (pt) 2NP (pt) 3NP(pt)(a) Portuguese0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 800.20.40.60.810NP (en) 1NP (en) 2NP (en) 3NP(en)(b) EnglishFigure 4: Percentage of occurrence of objects inPortuguese (4a) and in English (4b)this trend is reversed, but still maintaining a highproportion of subject dropping, around 40% ofverb usages, and around 60% including an overtsubject.
The precise age for this change cannotbe assessed from this data, due to the lack of sen-tences for 3-5 year old children in the Portuguesedata.
This difference between the two languagescan be explained as a result of Portuguese beinga (subject) pro-drop language and children beingconsistently exposed to subject dropping in theirlinguistic environment.
Although English is not apro-drop language, children, especially at an earlyage, still produce sentences without overt sub-jects, as much discussed in the literature (Valian,1991) and more recently (Yang, 2010).
Childrenlearning pro-drop languages seem to adopt it froman early age and use it with a frequency muchcloser to adult usage (Valian, 1991).In relation to other verb complements, we ex-amine the changes in the distribution of verbsand their subcategorization frames in the corpusacross children?s ages.
Figure 4 shows the distri-bution per age for verbs with one, two and threecomplements for both languages.
As expected ingeneral verbs with fewer complements are morefrequently used and as the number of comple-ments increases, the frequency decreases, for allages and for both languages.
Moreover, as age in-creases, there is a slight but constant increase inthe presence of verbs with 2 and 3 complementsin the corpus, with a small decrease in those withonly 1, which nonetheless still account for the ma-jority of the cases.
These patterns are more clearlyvisible for English, as more data is available thanfor Portuguese for all ages.To further investigate this we analyzed whethera relation between the number of complements ofa verb and its age of acquisition could be found.For English we used the age of acquisition (AoA)scores from Gilhooly and Logie (1980) which isavailable for 22 of the verbs in the English data,but from these two verbs were removed from theset, as they did not occur in all the ages.
For Por-tuguese, the scores from Marques et al (2007)are available for only four verbs in the CHILDEScorpora, and were therefore not considered in thisanalysis.
Using the total frequency for a verb inthe corpus, we calculated the relative frequenciesfor each number of complements (0, 1, 2 and 3)per age.
For each verb and each age the number ofcomplements with maximum frequency was usedas the basis for checking if a correlation with theAoA scores for the verb could be found.
In termsof the number of complements per age these verbscan be divided into 3 groups, apart from 2 of theverbs (lock and burn) that do not have any clearpattern:0-obj: for verbs that are used predominantly with-out complements throughout the ages, think,speak, swim, lie, turn, fly, try;1-obj: for verbs that appear consistently with 1complement for all ages, drive, chop, hate,find, win, tear;0-to-1: for verbs initially used mostly without com-plements but then consistently with 1 com-plement, hurt, guess, throw, kick, hide.In terms of the age of acquisition, verbs in the0-obj group tend to have lower scores than thosein the second group, with a 0.72 Spearman?s rankcorrelation coefficient indicating a high correla-tion between AoA and predominant number ofcomplements of a verb.
As the third group hadboth patterns, it was not considered in the anal-ysis.
These results suggest that the number ofsyntactic objects tends to increase with the ageof acquisition.
This may be partly explained by41a potential increase in complexity as the num-ber of obligatory arguments for a verb increase(Boynton-Hauerwas, 1998).
However, more in-vestigation is needed to confirm this trend.4 ConclusionsIn this paper we presented a wide-coverage pro-file of verbs in child-produced data, for Englishand Portuguese.
We examined the distributionof some lexical and syntactic characteristics ofverbs in these languages.
Common trends, suchas the prominent role of very general and poly-semic verbs among the most frequently used anda preference for smaller number of complementswere found throughout the ages in both languages.Divergences between them such as the proportionof subject dropping in each language were alsofound: a lower proportion for English which de-creases with age and a higher proportion for Por-tuguese which remains relatively high.
These re-sults are compatible with those reported by e.g.Goldberg (1999) and Valian (1991), respectively.Furthermore, for English we found a high cor-relation between a lower age of acquisition of averb and a lower predominant number of com-plements.
Given the size of the Portuguese data,for some of these analyses further investigationis needed with more data to confirm the trendsfound.For future work we intend to extend these anal-yses for other parts-of-speech, particularly nouns,also looking at other semantic and pragmatic fac-tors, such as polysemy, concreteness and famil-iarity.
In addition, we plan to examine intrinsic(e.g.
length of words; imageability; and famil-iarity) and and extrinsic factors (e.g.
frequency),and their effect in groups with typical develop-ment and with specific linguistic impairments.ReferencesBick, E. 2000.
