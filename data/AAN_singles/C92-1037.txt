Generic NPs and Habitual VPsAl lan RamsayDepar tment  of  Computer  Sc ienceUn ivers i ty  Col lege Dub l inBelf ield,  DUBL IN  4, I re landABSTRACTWe propose a simple, intuitively satisfyingtreatment of the semantics of bare pluralNPs.
This treatment avoids the use of non-standard logics, and avoids the need for sys-tematic ambiguity of verb semantics.1 BackgroundPrevious work on the semantics of bare plural NPshas largely focussed on the contribution they makein habitual sentences like(1) Mar~ eaiJ peaches.and(2) John likes driving fast cars.Both (1) and (2) seem to express tendencies, generalrules.
If you heard (1) then you would feel confi-dent that you could offer Mary a peach for dessert.
(1) seems to express a general characteristic of Mary,namely that if you offer her a peach in a suitable situ-ation she will eat it.
If you heard (2) then you wouldhide the keys of your Ferrari when John was visiting.
(2) tells you that if he gets the chance of driving afast car he is likely to take it.If we take (1) and (2) as paradigms of the way bareplural NPs get used then it is reasonable to supposethat they express ome hind of general property.
TheNP peaches in (1), for instance, seems to express omerelationship between Mary and peaches in general, orpossibly between Mary and the property of being apeach.
This feeling that bare plural NPs express gen-eral relationships has led to some rather desperatestrategies.
One is to suppose that they should betreated just as though they were universally quanti-fied.
The most cursory examination, however, showsthat this cannot be right.
It simply is not true that(1) entails that Mary has any relationship to the setof all peaches.
It is not even true that it entails thatshe will always eat a peach if you offer her one in theright circumstances.
Whatever bare plural NPs do,they do not act like universally quantified NPs.A more sophisticated approach treats them as de-noting properties.
Chierchia and Turner \[1987\], forinstance, interpret (1) as saying that Mary is in somerelationship to the property of being a peach.
Thereare two problems with this approach.
The first is thatthey fail to be very explicit about what this relation-ship is, so that the proposal simply does not get usvery far.
The second is that whatever the relationshipturns out to be we seem to end up with a systematicambiguity in the meanings of simple verbs like eat.
In(3) Mary is eating a peach.it looks as though the verb eat denotes u relation be-tween two individuals, namely Mary and some peach.In (1), however, it must denote a relationship betweenan individual (Mary) and a property (the property ofbeing a peach).
Eat, it seems, is polymorphic.
Andso must every other verb which can take either an in-definite NP or a bare plural as complement be.
Far-thermore, there must be some systematic relation be-tween the two interpretations of each of these verbs.It would surely be better to express this systematicrelation in the semantics of the bare plural NPs, andto leave verbs like eat as relations between individu-als.Much the same can be said of Carlson's \[1989\] pro-posal that bare plurals denote extended individualsand indefinite NPs denote stages ofindivlduals.
If wetake this approach then (a) most English verbs mustbe polymorphic, accepting either extended individ-uais or stages of individuals as arguments, and (b)there must be some systematic relationship betweenthese pairs of meanings.
It is particularly disappoint-ing that Carlson's discussion of this systematic rela-tionship consists of the use of a type-raising operatorGn which is given no semantics.A third approach is to try to capture the feelingthat bare plurals indicate some sort of "tendency"by appealing to non-monotonic logic.
Just as withthe analysis in terms of universals, however, this justseems to get the intuitions wrong.
What sort of non-monotonic paraphrase can we give to (1)?

It is easy to argue with the details ofthis analysis of (7), particularly with the temporalelement, but the basic outline is familiar.We now want an analysis of(8) Mary was ealin 9 peaches.which fits our intuition that (8) refers to an eatingevent whose agent was Mary and all of whose objectswere peaches.

This formal paraphrase seemsto fit our intuitions about (8) perfectly.
How did weobtain it?3 NP  semant icsWe follow the tradition first established by Rus-sell, and made concrete by Montague, of treatingNP semantics as generalised quantificrs, i.e.
as ex-pressions which provide the qnantificational informa-tion required for turning some proposition schemainto a proposition.
Montague, for instance, re-gards the meaning of every student as something likeX(P, YXstudent(X) -~ P.X) (we use the notationP.X to denote the application of P to X).
Applyingthis to a property such as A(Y, sleep(Y)) will producethe sent .
.
.
.
VX,tudent(X) --~ sleep(X).
In general,the meaning of an NP is treated in this tradition assomething which will lower the type of an expression- -  something which will turn a property into a propoosition, or a function from properties to properties intoa property, or .
.
.We make one slight change to this analysis of NPsemantics.
The standard treatment of NPs says thatthey are of type (e --, t) -* t. In other words,they take a function which maps individuals (en-tities of type e I to truth values (entities of typet) and return a truth value.
We propose to gen-eralise u step further, making NP semantics mapfunctions of type (e -4 t) --~ t to truth values(i.e.
that they arc of type ((e --, t) --4 t) --, t)).Thus we propose that the matrix for every stu-dent should be A(A, A.A(B, VC\[VD member(D, C)student(D)\] ~ B.C)).
The embedded expressionA( B, VU~/ D rnember( D, C) -~ student(D)\] --~ B.C)is similar to the generallsed quantifier that standardmodel theoretic semantics provides for every student.The only difference is that we are quantifying oversets of students (i.e.
over sets C satsifying the require-ment that VDmember(D,C) -* student(D)) ratherthan over individuals.
The meaning of the NP is thenan expression which is waiting for something whichwill combine with this standard generalised quanti-tier.
We will refer to such objects as genercllsed ~quantifiers, to emphasise the extra level of abstrac-tion.We obtain such representations of NP semantics inthe usual way, by taking the meanings of determin-ers to be even higher level objects which get com~bincd with the meanings of nominal groups.
Thusthe meaning of every is A(E, A(A, A.A(B, V C \[ V Dmember(D, C) --, E.D\] --* B.C))).
Applying this toA(X, student(X)), the meaning of the nominal groupconsisting of the word student, produces A(A, A.A(B,V C \[V D ,~,~er (V ,C)  ~.
stude,,t(D)\] ~ B.C))as required.
Similarly if the meaning of a is takento be A(E, A(A, 3 B b~ C me,,~r(C, B) -~ E.C\] ^IBI = 1 A A.A(D, D.B))) then the meaning of a peachbecomes ;t(A, ~ B IV C member(C, B) - .
peach(C)lA IBI : 1 A A.A(D, D.B)).
This is an abstractionover the proposition that there is some singleton setB all of whose members are peaches which satisfiessome complex property involving the abstracted vari-able, which is again what we require.
Note that theapplication of A in this formula is inside the scope ofthe quantifcation over members of B.
It is this ex-tra control over the relative scope of quantifiers thatmakes us prefer generalised ~ quantifiers to ordinarygencralised quantifiers.ACRES DE COLING-92, NArCrES, 23-28 Ao(rr 1992 2 2 7 PROC.

23-28, 1992does not mean that Mary eats most peaches~ in thesense that there is some relationship between Maryand more than half the peaches there either are nowor ever have been.
It does not mean that it is fre-quently, or even usually, the case that she can befound eating a peach (it is true, for instance, that Ieat quails eggs, but it is certainly not true that it hap-pens very often).
The gut feeling that sentences llke(1) and (2) express general tendencies, and that thebest machinery we have for dealing with tendencies inon-monotonic logic, is very understandable.
It doesnot, however, seem easy to give convincing formalparaphrases of sentences like these in these terms.The problems with these suggestions arise from thefact (1) and (2) seem to express general tendencies,and that this is taken to be due the presence of thebare plurals NPs.
Suppose we consider instead theoccurrence of bare plural NPs in non-habitual sen-tences:(4) Marl/ is eaZingpeaches.
(5) John is driving fast cars.
(4) does not express any sort of tendency, any generalrule.
It describes a specific current event.
There isan individual, Mary, who is doing something.
Whatis she doing?
She's eating.
What is she eating?
Sheis eating several things, each of which is a peach.
(5) does not even seem to make much sense.
Whynot?
Because it seems to describe a specific drivingevent with a single agent but with several objects,each of which is a fast car.
(5) seems odd becauseit seems to say that John is driving several fast carsat the same time, and we know that most people canonly drive one ear at a time.We therefore suggest hat the feeling that (1) and(2) express tendencies arises entirely from the formof the verb, and that bate plurals should be thoughtof as delimiting the arguments of the verb.
In otherwords, we sugest that (4) should be thought of inmuch the same way as(6) Ma~ is house-hunting.which says what Mary is doing is hunting for some-thing, and that what she is looking for is a house.2 Semant ic  F rameworkThe treatment of bare plurals proposed in this paperntJ within the following general framework.?
Verbs denote events (subdivided into states, ex-tended actions and instantaneous actions).?
There is a finite set of thematic roles, such asagent, instrument, target and object.
The syn-tactic sub-categorisation rules of individual verbsallocate sets of items to these roles.
These sets of-ten turn out to be singletons, but it seems betterto distinguish between singular and plural NPsin terms of the cardinality of some tee of objectsthan to say that singular NPs denote individualsand plurals denote sets.?
Tense and aspect express relations betweenevents or sets of events and temporal objects uchas instants and intervals.?
Definite reference and anaphora re treated asPRESUPPOSITION-INDUCING mechanisms.
Pre-suppositions are described in terms of formulaeeach of which is required to pick out exactly oneitem in the context of an utterance.
The seman-tics of any natural anguage xpression consistsof a set of such presuppositions and a matrix,which corresponds to the usual notion of propo-sitional content.The dements of this framework ate not universallyaccepted, but they do at least all have respectableancestors.
The most contentious is the view thatdefinite reference and anaphora should be dealt within terms of constraints on the situation of utterance.The basic notion here is similar to the use of ANCHORSin situation semantics \[Barwise & Perry 1983\], and tothe treatment ofanaphora in DRT \[Kamp 1984\].
Thedetails of our approach are given in \[Ramsay 1990a\].Very little in the present discussion of bare plurals de-pends on this treatment of definite reference.
Scepticsabout this part of our framework are invited to sus-pend their disbelief while considering the treatmentof bare plurals.The following analysis of(7) John a~e a peach.should illustrate the crucial aspects of our represen-tation:\[.~tri~ :3A  3B VC mer.~r(C, B) -4 ~h(C)^ IBI = 1A VD member(D, A)eat(D)A agent(D, E)^ objed(D, B)m IAI = 1A VF member(F, A)--~ eztended( F)A 3G instant(G)A G < nowA at(G, F),Acrv.s DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~r 1992 2 2 8 PROC.
OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992In order to interpret bare plurM NPs we need thefollowing rule:\[sV,,taz : \ [ma jor  : \[cat : u, bar : 2\],head : \[agree : \[~hird : \[sing :: no,Vl,,ral = yes\]\],?..\]}misc = \[slaM, = null, wh : no,.

The matrixof the NP consists of a generalised 2 quantifier derivedfrom the matrix of the NN, and the presuppositionsof the NN are inherited by the NP.This is exactly the rule we need to obtain\[matriz : A(A, A.A(B, VC B.C -~ peach(C))),presuppositions = {}\]the meaning of the bare plural peaches, and henceto obtain the interpretation given above of (8).
It isworth noting that bare plurals as subject have verymuch the same effect - -  that the analysis of(9) Wolves were chasing a deer?says that there was a past instantaneous chasing eventwhose object was a (singleton set of) deer and all ofwhose agenfs were wolves:\[raxdriz =3A instant(A) A A < ,towA 3B VC nvember(C, B)- .

How do wedeal with their use in habituM sentences like (1)?We take it that (1) somehow expresses a generaltendency, qb say Mar T eats peaches i  to say that onsuitable occasions he can be found eating peaches.The word %uitable n carries a lot weight here?
If yousay Mary cain Beluga caviar, you probably mean thatshe eats it whenever she can get it.
If you say Maryeats sausages you are more likely to mean that she he~quently eats thent, probably because she's too poorto afford caviar very often.
Indeed, the ehameteri~tt-tion of Usuitable" is likely to change from situation tosituation eveu for the same sentence.
You could sayShe eats sausages lit response to the question Is Marta funny eater?, iu which ease Usuitable" might meansomething like "if she's offered them and there's noother choice".
You could also say it in response totile question Does Mary \]tare a health v varied diet ?.Here, %uitable" would be more likely to memt Sonnearly every occasion when site eats anything at all".We suggest hat the best way to dam with this hto treat habituals as simply saying that events of thekind iu question exist.
The significance oftmying thatsuch events exist will depend on the situation in whichit is said.
Suppose you say that events in which Maryeats sausages exist in a situation where your hearerwants to know about the existence of events whereshe eats things that some people might not like (i.e.in response to Is Mary a fussy eater~.
), in such acase the fact that there are such events is enough tosatisfy the heater's curiosity, and there are thereforeno grounds for them to assume anything about howoften site eats them.
Suppose, on the other hand, thatyou respond to a question about the variety of her dietby simply saying that there are occasions when sheeats sausages.
Your hearer is then likely to assumethat you are implicating that these are MI or most ofthe "Mary eating something" events that you knowabout, since if you knew about other things Mary atethen you would know that her diet was reasonablyvaried, lit other words, hnbituaLs imply posit theexistence of sonic set of events of the specified kind.Decisious about whether these events are common,about he circumstances in which they occur, can onlybe made on the basis of extra-linguistic contextuMfacts.We theretbre analyse the sentence(10) Mary drives a fast car.Ks:lain/vii =:~IA ~JB VC men~er(C, B)ACRES DE COL1NG-92, NANTES, 23-28 hO~r 1992 2 2 9 PROC.

All that (10) actually says is that there issuch a set of events.This analysis of habituals gives a clue as to why(11) John eats a peach.does not seem to admit a habitual reading.
The in-terpretation of (11) as\[matri~ =3A 3B VC member(C, B)-~ push(C)^ In l - -  1A VD member(D, A)eat(D)^ agent(D, E)^ objea(D, ~)A JA I > 1,presuppositions = {t(E, VF member(F, E)--..~me(F. john)^ IEI = 1)}\]says that there is a single peach which is the objectof several eating events.
Since a given peach can onlybe eaten once, this seems most unlikely.There are, of course, still open questions concerningthe interpretation of sentences like:(12) John cats a peach for his lunch cver~ day.
(12) clearly does require a habitual reading, whereeach day he eats a different peach.
It seems likely thatsome mechanism such as "Cooper storage n \[Cooper1983, Keller 1987\] for delaying decisions about quan-tifier scope will be required here.
The exact details ofthis mechanism do not concern us here.
We simplynote that something of this kind seems to be nec-essary anyway for traditional problems of quantifierscope ambiguity.
Since we will, for instance, needsomething like this for obtaining the de re/de dittoreadings of(13) John wants to catch a unicorn.we will assume that we will be able to rely on it fordealing with the relation between (11) and (12) aswell, We end the current discussion by noting thatour analyses of bare plurals and habituals do st  leastprovide a sensible formal paraphrase of (1):\[matriz -=3A V B member(B, A)eat(n)A agent(B, C)^ VD ~bjea(.. D)^ IAI > 1,was,,m~osit~,,s = {,(C, VE mer,~,-(E, C).,*me(E, nu*rU)^ ICI = 1)}\]This analysis of (I) says that there are eating eventswhose agent is Mary and all of whose objects arepeaches.
This seems to be about as much as youcan reasonably expect to get from (1) without someextra contextua!
information.5 Conc lus ionsWe have argued that the semantics of bare pluralscan be captured without any extension to the formalunderpinning of our semantic framework.
The essen-tial points were that 0) we separated out the effectsof the habitual aspect and of the bare plural; (it) weassume that the fillers for thematic roles are alwayssets of items, with singular NPs denoting singletonsets.
This enables us to avoid postulating a system-atic polymorphism for verb semantics t with one inter-pretation in terms of individuals for cases where someargument is supplied by a singular NP and another interms of sets of individuals for cases where the sameargument is supplied by a plural NP; and (iii) weused an event-oriented treatment of verb semantics(see for instance Davidson \[1980\]).
It is worth notingthat Kr i t~  \[19901 and Pulman \[1991\] have also devel-oped treatments of complex quantificstional phenom-ena on the basis of this kind of treatment of verbs.The realisation that verbs can denote sets of eventsin the same way that NPs can denote sets of indi-viduals, and that you can quantify over these as wellover the individuals and sets of individuals denotedby NPs, seems to provide n great deal of flexibilitywithout increasing your ontological commitments.The analyses of bare plurals and habituals dis-cussed above have been implemented in u version ofthe system described in \[Ramsay 1990a\].
This sys-tem includes a left-corner chart parser, lexical en-tries containing subcategorisation frames, disjunctiveunification of the kind described in \[Ramsay 1990b\],ACTES DE COLING-92, NANaT.S, 23-28 bOUT 1992 2 3 0 PROC.

All of the example semantic anal-yses were derived by this system.
I would in factsay that unless you have a working implementationof your grammar and semantics, including automatic/f-reduction of applications of A-abntractioas t thenthe sheer complexity of the semantic formulae thatarise will overwhelm you.
Deciding, for instance,that using A(A,-~B VC' member(C',B) -4 D.C AIBI = 1 A A.A(E,E.B)) for the matrix of a ledto more satisfactory analyses of indefinite NPs thanX(A,A.X(E, 3B VC memher(C,B)-~ D.C A IBI=1 A (E.B))) would have been a great deal more te-dious than it was if I had not had a system whichwould show me the consequences of the two choicesin n variety of settings.REFERENCESBarwise J.
