Espe-cially for the syntactic and semantic pars-ing modules, we achieved good resultsin some relevant evaluations, such asCoNLL and SemEval.
Based on XML in-ternal data representation, users can easilyuse these modules and corpora by invok-ing DLL (Dynamic Link Library) or Webservice APIs (Application Program Inter-face), and view the processing results di-rectly by the visualization tool.1 IntroductionA Chinese natural language processing (NLP)platform always includes lexical analysis (wordsegmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named en-tity recognition), syntactic parsing and seman-tic parsing (word sense disambiguation, semanticrole labeling) modules.
It is a laborious and time-consuming work for researchers to develop a fullNLP platform, especially for Chinese, which hasfewer existing NLP tools.
Therefore, it should beof particular concern to build an integrated Chi-nese processing platform.
There are some keyproblems for such a platform: providing high per-formance language processing modules, integrat-ing these modules smoothly, using processing re-sults conveniently, and showing processing resultsdirectly.LTP (Language Technology Platform), a Chi-nese processing platform, is built to solve theabove mentioned problems.
It uses XML to trans-fer data through modules and provides all sorts?

Its architec-ture is shown in Figure 1.
From bottom to up, LTPcomprises 6 components: ?
Corpora, ?
VariousChinese processing modules, ?
XML based inter-nal data presentation and processing, ?
DLL API,?
Web service, and ?
Visualization tool.
In thefollowing sections, we will introduce these com-ponents in detail.2.1 CorporaMany NLP tasks are based on annotated corpora.We distributed two key corpora used by LTP.First, WordMap is a Chinese thesaurus whichcontains 100,093 words.
In WordMap, each wordsense belongs to a five-level categories.
There are12 top, about 100 second and 1,500 third level,and more fourth and fifth level categories.
For in-stance, the Chinese word ??
has the follow-ing two senses:1http://ir.hit.edu.cn/ltp/131.
?(entity) ?
(common name) ?
(goods) ?(goods) ?(material)?2.
?(human beings) ?
(ability) ?
(hero) ?(talents) ?(talents)?We can see that the two senses belong to ??
(entity) and ??
(human beings) top categoriesrespectively.
In each category, the concept be-comes more and more specifical.The second corpus is Chinese DependencyTreebank (CDT) (Liu et al, 2006).
It is annotatedwith the dependency structure and contains 24 de-pendency relation tags, such as SUB, OBJ, andADV.
It consists of 10,000 sentences randomly ex-tracted from the first six-month corpus of People?sDaily (China) in 1998, which has been annotatedwith lexical tags, including word segmentation,part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recog-nition tags2.2.2 Chinese Processing ModulesWe have developed 6 state-of-the-art Chinese pro-cessing modules for LTP.1.
Word Segmentation (WordSeg): A CRFmodel (Lafferty et al, 2001) is used to segmentChinese words.
All of the People?s Daily (China)corpus is used as training data.2.
Part-of-Speech Tagging (POSTag): Weadopt SVMTool3 for Chinese POS taggingtask (Wang et al, 2009).
The People?s Daily cor-pus is also used here.3.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): LTP canidentify six sorts of named entity: Person, Loc,Org, Time, Date and Quantity.
A maximum en-tropy model (Berger et al, 1996) is adopted here.We still used the People?s Daily corpus.4.
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD): Thisis an all word WSD system, which labels theWordMap sense of each word.
It adopts an SVMmodel (Guo et al, 2007), which obtains the bestperformance in SemEval 2009 Task 11: EnglishLexical Sample Task via English-Chinese ParallelText.5.
Syntactic Parsing (Parser): Dependencygrammar is used in our syntactic parser.
A highorder graph-based model (Che et al, 2009) isadopted here which achieved the third place of2http://icl.pku.edu.cn/icl res/3http://www.lsi.upc.edu/?nlp/SVMTool/Modules Performance SpeedWordSeg F1 = 97.4 185KB/sPOSTag The overall Accuracy =97.80%, and the out of vo-cabulary word Accuracy =85.48%56.3KB/sNER The overall F1 = 92.25 14.4KB/sWSD The all word WSDAccuracy = 94.34%and the multi-sense wordAccuracy = 91.29%7.2KB/sParser LAS (Labeled AttachmentScore) = 73.91% and UAS(Unlabeled AttachmentScore) = 78.23%0.2KB/sSRL F1 = 77.15 1.3KB/sTable 1: The performance and speed for eachmodule.the dependency syntactic parsing subtask in theCoNLL-2009 Syntactic and Semantic Dependen-cies in Multiple Languages Shared Task (Hajic?
etal., 2009).6.
Semantic Role Labeling (SRL): SRL is toidentify the relations between predicates in a sen-tence and their associated arguments.
The moduleis based on syntactic parser.
A maximum entropymodel (Che et al, 2009) is adopted here whichachieved the first place in the joint task of syn-tactic and semantic dependencies of the CoNLL-2009 Shared Task.Table 1 shows the performance and speed ofeach module in detail.
The performances are ob-tained with n-fold cross-validation method.
Thespeed is gotten on a machine with Xeon 2.0GHzCPU and 4G Memory.At present, LTP processes these modules witha cascaded mechanism, i.e., some higher-levelprocessing modules depend on other lower-levelmodules.
For example, WSD needs to take theoutput of POSTag as input; while before POSTag,the document must be processed with WordSeg.LTP can guarantee that the lower-level modulesare invoked automatically when invoking higher-level modules.2.3 LTMLWe adopt eXtensible Markup Language (XML) asthe internal data presentation for some reasons.First, XML is a simple, flexible text format, andplays an increasingly important role in the ex-14change of a wide variety of data on the Web andelsewhere.
Second, there exist many powerful andsimple XML parsers.
With these tools, we caneasily and effectively achieve all kinds of opera-tions on XML.
Finally, based on XML, we caneasily implement visualization with some scriptlanguages such as JavaScript.Based on XML, we have designed a tag-set forNLP platform, named LTML (Language Technol-ogy Markup Language).
Basically, we regard aword as a unit.
The word has attributes such as id,pos, wsd, etc., which indicate the index, part-of-speech, word sense, etc.
information of the word.A sentence consists of a word sequence and thena series of sentences compose a paragraph.
Thesemantic role labeling arguments are attached tosemantic predicate words.
The meaning of eachtag and attribute are explained in Table 2.Tag Meaning Attr.

I/O Operation: Load texts or LTML filesand convert them into DOM (Document ObjectModel); Save DOM to XML files.2.
Module Invoking: Invoke the 6 Chinese pro-cessing modules.3.
Result Extraction: Get the results producedby the modules.Through invoking these APIs, users can accom-plish some NLP tasks simply and conveniently.Assuming that we want to get the part-of-speechtags of a document, we can implement it withPython programming language easily as shown inFigure 2.from ltp_interface import *CreateDOMFromTxt("test.txt") # Load a textPOStag()          # Invoke POS taggerfor i in range( CountSentenceInDocument() ):# Handle each sentence in a documentword_list = GetWordsFromSentence(i)  # Get wordspos_list = GetPOSsFromSentence(i)    #  Get POS?
?Figure 2: LTP Python API exampleHowever, the DLL API has some shortcomings.First, it only can be used on Microsoft Windowsmachines.
Second, users must download hugemodel files when LTP is updated.
Third, LTPneeds a high performance machine to run.
All ofabove problems prevent from its widespread ap-plications.2.5 Web ServiceIn recent years, the Internet has become a platformwhere we can acquire all kinds of services.
Userscan build their own applications using LTP Webservices conveniently.
The LTP Web service hasthe following four advantages:1.
No need to setup LTP system.2.
No need to burden hardware to run LTP.15Figure 3: Sentence processing result3.
Update promptly and smoothly.4.
Cross most operating systems and program-ming languages.2.6 VisualizationA clear visualization can help researchers to ex-amine processing results.
We develop an cross-platform and cross-browser visualization tool withFLEX technology, which can be used easily with-out installing any excess software.Figure 3 shows the integrated sentence process-ing results.
The Rows 1 to 4 are the WordSeg,POSTag, WSD, and NER results.
The last rowsare the SRL results for different predicates.
Thesyntactic dependency Parser tree is shown abovewith relation labels.2.7 SharingWe have been sharing LTP freely for academicpurposes4.
Until now, more than 350 worldwideresearch institutes have shared LTP with license.Some famous IT corporations of China, such asHuaWei5 and Kingsoft6, have bought LTP?s com-mercial license.
According to incompletely statis-tics, there are more than 60 publications whichcited LTP, and the LTP web site has more than 30unique visitors per day on the average.3 Conclusion and Future WorkIn this paper we describe an integrated Chineseprocessing platform, LTP.
