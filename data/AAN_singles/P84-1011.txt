AbstractIn this paper, we focus on the features of alexicon for Japanese syntactic analysis inJapanese-to-English translation.
Japanese wordorder is almost unrestricted and Kc~uio-~ti(postpos i t iona l  case  par t i c le )  i s  an impor tantdevice which acts as the case label(case marker)in Japanese sentences.
Therefore case grammar isthe most effective grammar for Japanese syntacticanalysis.The case frame governed by )buc~n and havingsurface case(Kakuio-shi), deep case(case label)and semantic markers for nouns is analyzed here toillustrate how we apply case grammar to Japanesesyntactic analysis in our system.The parts of speech are classified into 58sub-categories.We analyze semantic features for nouns andpronouns classified into sub-categories and wepresent a system for semantic markers.
Lexiconformats for syntactic and semantic features arecomposed of different features classified by partof speech.As this system uses LISP as the programminglanguage, the lexicons are written as S-expressionin LISP.

IntroductignThe Mu-project is a national projectsupported by the STA(Science and TechnologyAgency), the full name of which is "Research on aMachine Translation System(Japanese - English> forScientific and Technological Documents.
'~We are currently restricting the domain oftranslation to abstract papers in scientific andtechnological fields.
The system is based on atransfer approach and consist of three phases:analysis, transfer andgeneration.In the first phase of machine translation.analysis, morphological analysis divides thesentence into lexical items and then proceeds withsemantic analysis on the basis of case grammar inJapanese.
In the second phase, transfer, lexicalfeatures are transferred and at the same time, thesyntactic structures are also transferred bymatching tree pattern from Japanese to English, Inthe final generation phase, we generate thesyntactic structures and the morphologicalfeatures  in English.2.
Coac_~pt of_~_Deoendencv Structure based onCase Gramma\[_/n Jap_a_D~In Japan, we have come to the conclusion thatcase grammar is most suitable grammar for Japanesesyntactic analysis for machine translationsystems.
This type of grammar had been proposedand studied by Japanese linguists beforeFillmore's presentation.As word order is heavily restricted inEnglish syntax, ATNG~Augmented Transition NetworkGrammar) based on CFG~Context Free Grammar ) isadequate for syntactic analysis in English.
On theother hand, Japanese word order is almostunrestricted and K~l!,jlio--shi play an important roleas case labels in Japanese sentences.
Thereforecase grammar is the most effective grammar forJapanese syntactic analysis.In Japanese syntactic structure, the wordorder is free except for a predicate(verb or verbphrase) located at the end of a sentence.
In casegrammar, the verb plays a very important roleduring syntactic analysis, and the other parts ofspeech only perform in partnership with, andequally subordinate to.
the verb.That is.
syntactic analysis proceeds bychecking the semantic compatibility between verband nouns.
Consequently.
the semantic structure ofa sentence can be extracted at the same time assyntactic analysis.3.

2, Extract semantic elements from the word.3) Judge the agreement between a semantical slotconcept and extracted semantical element word byword, and attach the cor respond ing  semanticmarkers.
4; As a result, one word may have manysemantic markers.
However, the number of semanticmarkers for one word is restricted to five.
Ifthere are plural filial slots at the end.
thehigher family slot is used for semanticfeaturization of the word.I t  i s  easy to dec ide semantic markers fortechn ica l  and spec i f i c  words.
But, i t  i s  not easyto mark common words, because one word has manymeanings.~..__Lexicon Z_Qr na,t .f_o_r.

con__cJJ~i_o_nWe have reached the opinion that it isnecessary to develop a way of allocating semanticmarkers automatically to overcome the ambiguitiesin word meaning confronting the human attemptingthis task.In the same thing, there are problems how tofind an English term corresponding to the Japanesetechnical terms not stored in dictionary, how tocollect a large number of technical termseffectively and to decide the length of compoundwords, and how to edit this lexicon data baseeasily, accurately, safely and speedily.In lexicon development for a huge volume ofYou(~n , it is quite important that we have a wayof collecting automatically many usages of verbalcase frames, and we suppose it exist differentcase frames in different domains.Ackn_o_Ki~Lgm~_We would like to thank Mrs. MutsukoKimura(IBS~, Toyo information Systems Co. Ltd.,Japan Convention Sorvice Co. Ltd., and the othermembers of the Mu-projeet working group for theuseful discussions which led to many of the ideaspresented in this paper.Rcf_c~.
