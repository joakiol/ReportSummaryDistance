Closed Yesterday and Closed Minds:Asking the Right Questions of the CorpusTo Distinguish Thematic from SententialRelat ionsUr i  Zern ikArt i f ic ia l  Inte l l igence LaboratoryGenera l  E lect r ic  - Research  and  Deve lopment  CenterAbst ractCollocation-based tagging and bracketing pro-graras have attained promising results.
Yet,they have not arrived at the stage where theycould be used as pre-procezsors for full-fledgedparsing.
Accuracy is still not high enough.To improve accuracy, it is necessary to inves-tigate the points where statistical data is beingmisinterpreted, leading to incorrect results.In this paper we investigate inaccuracy whichis injected when a pre-processor relies solely oncollocations and blurs the distinction betweentwo separate relations: thematic relations andsentential relations.Thematic relations are word pairs, not nec-essarily adjacent, (e.g., adjourn a meeting) thatencode information at the concept level.
Sen-tential relations, on the other hand, concernadjacent word pairs that form a noun group.E.g., preferred stock is a noun group that mustbe identified as such at ttle syntactic level.Blurring the difference between these twophenomena contributes to errors in tagging ofpairs such as ezpressed concerns, a verb-nounconstruct, as opposed to preferred stocks, anadjective-noun construct.
Although both re-lations are manifested in the corpus as highmutual-information collocations, they possessdifl'erent prot)erties and they need to be sepa-raled.In our method, we distinguish between thesetwo cases by asking additional questions of thecorpus.
By definition, thematic relations takeon filrther variations in the corpus.
Expressedconcerns (a thematic relation) takes concernsexpressed, expressing concerns, express his con-cerns ere.
On the other hand, preferred stock(a sentential relation) does not take any suchsyntactic variations.We show how this method impacts pre-processing and parsing, and we provide em-pirical results based on the analysis of an 80-million word corpus.

Sucha mechanism would recieve its tokens in theform of words, characters, or morphemes, ne-gotiate all given constraints, and produce a fullchart with all possible interpretations.However, when tested on a real corpus, (i.e.,Wall Street Journal (WSJ) news stories), thismechanism fares poorly.
For one thing, a typ-ical well-behaved 34-word sentence produceshundreds of candidate interpretations.
In ef-fect the parsing burden is passed onto a postprocessor whose task is to select the appropri-ate parse tree within the entire forest.For another, ill-behaved sentences - roughlyone out of three WSJ sentences i  problematic- yield no consistent interpretation whatsoeverdue to parsing failures.To alleviate problems associated with roughedges in real text, a new strategy has emerged,involving text pre-processing.
A pre-processor,capitalizing on statistical data \[Church el aL,1989; Zernik and Jacobs, 1990; Dagan et al,1991\], and customized to the corpus itself,could abstract idiosyncracies, highlight regu-larities, and, in general, feed digested text intothe unification parser.What  is P re -Process ing  UpAga ins t?The  L inguist ic  PhenomenonConsider (Figure 1) a WSJ (August 19, 1987)paragraph processed by NLpc (NL corpus pro~eessing) \[Zernik el aL, 1991J.

Each word is associated with candi-dales part of speech, and almost all words areambiguous.
The tagger's task is to resolve theambiguity.For example, ambiguous words such as ser-vices, preferred, and expressed, should betagged as noun (nn), adjective (aj), and verb(vb), respectively.

*period*In case 1, a main verb is found (i.e., was), andpreferred is taken as art adjective; in case 2,a main verb is not found, and therefore z-pressed itself is taken as the main verb.
Thiskind of mnbiguity requires fidl-fledged uni-fication, and it is not bandied by the pre-processor.
Fortunately, only a small percentof the cases (in newspaper stories) depend onglobal reading.Corpus-based prefereltce: Corpus analysis(WSJ, 80-million words) provides word-association preference \[Beckwith el at., 1991\]col location total  vb-nn  a j -nnpreferred stock 2314 100 Oexpressed concern 318 1 99The construct expressed concern, which ap-pears 318 times in the corpus, is 99% a verb-noun construct; on tile other hand, preferredstock, which appears in the corpus 2314times, is 99% an adjective-norm construct.
3Where  Is The  Ev idence?The last item, however, is not directly avail-able.
Since the corpus is not a-priori tagged,there is no direct eviderLcc regarding part-of-speech.
All we get from the corpus are num-bers that indicate the mutual information score(MIS) \[Church el al., 1991\] of collocations (9.9and 8.7, tbr preferred stock and expressed con-cern, respectively).
It becomes necessary to in-fer the nature of the combination from indirectcorpus~based statistics as shown by the rest ofthis paper.3For expository psrposes we chose here two ex-treme, clear cut cases; other pairs (e.g., promisedmoney) are not totally biased towards one side oranother.ACIES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOt\]T 1992 1 3 0 7 PRO(:.
O1: COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992Inferring Syntax fromCollocationsIn this section we describe the method used foreliciting word-association preference from thecorpus.In i t ia l  Observat ion :  Co-occur renceEnta i l s  Sentent ia l  Re la t ionsThe bazic intuition used invariably by all ex-isting statistical taggers is stated as follows:Significant collocations (i.e., high MIS) predictsyntactic word association.
Since, for example,preferred stock is a significant collocation (mis9.9), with all other clues assumed neutral, itwill be marked as an integral noun group inthe sentence.However, is high mis always a good predic-tor?
Figure 3 provides mutual informationscores for preferred, expressed, and closed rightcollocations.The first column (preferred) suggests mis isa perfect predictor.
A count in the corpus con-firms that a predictor based on collocations isalways correct.
A small sample of preferred col-locations in context is given Figure 4.
Noticethat in all eases, preferred is an adjective.Next  Observat ion :  Co-occur renceEnta i l s  Themat ic  Re la t ionsWhile column 1 (preferred) yields good syntac-tic associations, column 2 (ezpressed) and col-umn 3 (closed) yield different conclusions.
Itturns out (see Figure 4) that expressed colloca-tions, even collocations with high mis, producea bias towards false-positive groupings.
4If these collocation do not signify wordgroupings, what do they signify?
An obser-vation of expressed right collocates reveals thatthe words surprise, confidence, skepticism, op-timism, disappointment, support, hope, doubt,4Word associations based on corpus do not dic-tate the nature of word groupings; they merely pro-vide a predictor that is accounted for with otherlocaJ-context clues.worry, salisfaclion, etc., are all thematic rela-tions of express.Namely, a pair such as expressed isappoint-ment denotes an action-object relation whichcould come in many variants.
The last part ofFigure 4 shows various combinations of expressand its collocates.Us ing  Add i t iona l  Ev idenceIn light of this observation, it is necessary totest in the corpus whether collocations are fixedor variable.
For a collocation wordl-word2, ifwordl and word2 combine in multiple ways,then wordl-word2 is taken as a thematic re-lation; otherwise it is taken as a fixed noungroup.This test for ezpress~word is shown in Figure5.
Each row provides the number of times eachvariant is found.
Variants for expressed con-cerns, for example, are concerti expressed, ex-press concern, ezpresses concern, and express.ing concern.
Not shown here is the count forsplit co-occurrence \[Smadja, 1991\], i.e., expressits concern, concern was expressed.
The lastcolumn sums up the result as a ratio (variabil-ity ratio) against he original collocation.In conclusion, for 12 out of 15 of the checkedcollocations we found a reasonable degree ofvariability.Making Statistics OperationalWhile the analysis in Figure 5 provides the mo-tivation for using additional evidence, we havetwo steps to take to make this evidence usefulwithin an operational tagger.Dea l ing  w i th  Smal l  NumbersAlthough the table in Figure 5 is adequatefor expository purposes, in practice the differ-ent collected figures are spread over too manyrubrics, making the numbers susceptible tonoise.To avoid this problem we short-cut the calcu-lation above and collect all the co-occurrence ofAcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~r 1992 I 3 0 8 PROC.
