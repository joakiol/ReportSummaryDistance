Proceedings of COLING 2014, the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Tutorial Abstracts,pages 5?7, Dublin, Ireland, August 23-29 2014.Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation and Entity LinkingRoberto Navigli and Andrea MoroDipartimento di Informatica, Sapienza Universit`a di RomaViale Regina Elena 295, 00161 Roma, Italy{moro, navigli}@di.uniroma1.itTutorial Motivation and DescriptionNowadays the textual information available online is provided in an increasingly wide range of lan-guages.
This language explosion clearly forces researchers to focus on the challenging problem of beingable to analyze and understand text written in any language.
At the core of this problem lies the lexicalambiguity of language, an issue which is addressed by two key tasks in computational lexical semantics:multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Entity Linking (EL).WSD (Navigli, 2009) is a historical task in Computational Linguistics aimed at explicitly assigningmeanings to word occurrences within text, while EL (Erbs et al., 2011; Rao et al., 2013; Cornolti et al.,2013) is a recent task focused on finding mentions of entities within a text and linking them to the mostsuitable entry in a knowledge base, if one exists.
The two main differences between WSD and EL arein the kind of inventory used, i.e.
dictionary vs. encyclopedia, and the assumption that the mention iscomplete or potentially incomplete, respectively.
Notwithstanding these differences, the tasks are prettysimilar in nature, in that they both involve the disambiguation of textual fragments in a given languageaccording to a reference inventory.
Nevertheless, the research community has tackled the two tasksseparately, often duplicating efforts and solutions.
Moreover, the vast majority of the state-of-the-artapproaches only marginally take into account languages different from English.In this tutorial, we present the two tasks of multilingual WSD and EL, by surveying the challengesinvolved and the most effective solutions, both in isolation by illustrating the state of the art in the twofields, and when the tasks are addressed in a unified, multilingual way.In particular, this tutorial covers three key aspects of the multilingual WSD and EL tasks:1.
Multilingual inventories of word senses and named entities;2.
State-of-the-art methods to perform disambiguation and linking;3.
Evaluation of the systems: gold standard datasets and performance measures.The tutorial is aimed at stressing the key challenges of the tasks of WSD and EL when moving from amonolingual to a multilingual setup.
The tutorial includes examples and discussions intended to illustrateand clarify the major challenges of the tasks and which solutions are most appropriate to which problem.Organization of the tutorialThe half-day tutorial contains sessions on the following topics:1.
Introduction (30 mins) This first session will provide the necessary background, definitions andexamples for the two considered tasks: multilingual WSD and EL.2.
The multilingual inventory for word senses and named entities (45 mins) In this session we willoverview the definitions of the inventories used in state-of-the-art approaches both for WSD andThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

We will then discuss the key aspects of partial matching for EL and, finally, we will describemultilingual inventories of word senses and named entities, among which Open Multilingual Word-Net (Bond and Foster, 2013), Wikipedia1, DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007), BabelNet (Navigli andPonzetto, 2012).3.
State of the art in WSD and EL (75 mins) This session will introduce the key challenges to the tasksof WSD and EL and the well-known approaches, such as IMS (Zhong and Ng, 2010) and UKB(Agirre et al., 2013) for WSD, and Babelfy (Moro et al., 2014), AIDA (Hoffart et al., 2011; Hoffartet al., 2012), Tagme (Ferragina and Scaiella, 2010; Ferragina and Scaiella, 2012), Illinois Wikifier(Cheng and Roth, 2013) and DBpedia Spotlight (Mendes et al., 2011; Daiber et al., 2013), that canpartially address them.
Challenges include: the lack of training data for non-English languages,the granularity of the sense inventory, the high level of ambiguity in EL, the most frequent sensebaseline challenge, etc.4.
Evaluation measures and gold standard datasets (30 mins) We will conclude the tutorial by describ-ing the standard performance measures for these tasks and well-known datasets for multilingualWSD and EL together with a discussion of the results.SpeakersRoberto Navigli is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at the Sapienza Uni-versity of Rome.
