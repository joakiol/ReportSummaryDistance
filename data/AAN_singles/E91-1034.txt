Tire lexicaldatabase of tire system contahrs emantic btfonnationthat catmot be elicited from the existhrg dictionaries.Tire priority is given to semantic features influenchtglexical or grammatical co-occurrence restrictions.
Pos-sibilities are discussed of predicting selectional restric-tions on the basis of semantic features of a word bz thelexicon.1.LEX ICAL  DATABASE OF  THESYSTEMLEXICOGRAPllER is an expert systemdesigned, inthe first place, for the purposes of naturallanguage processing.
The work on the project is beingconducted by a group of researchers includingE.Belorusova, S.Krylov, E.Rakhilina, M.Filipenkoe.a.
; cf.
Paduchcva,Rakhilina 1989.The system consists of two basic components:- -  lexical database (LBD);- -  bibliographical database (BBD).LBD is a vocabulary presented in a machinereadable form and consisting of several domaines, asin a usual relational database.
The user may getinformation about morphology, syntactic features,semantic features, prosody and referential features ofindividual iexical items.
Among the semantic featuresthat are included or must be included in the databasethere are such features as: \[ + Speech act verb\], \[+ Per-formative verb\], \[+ Verb of motion\], \[ + Kinship term\],\]+Part of the body\], \[+Person (as opposed to aphysical body)\], \[+Parameter\], etc., all in all - -several dozen features.Programs now existing {ve the following options:- -  marking the vocabulary by a feature presentedas a list of words;- -  compiling lists of words possessing a commonfeature or a set of features named;compiling lists of documents containing infor-mation about the lexeme named, as well as about agiven feature or a set of features;compiling alphabetical lists of words and fea-tures mentioned in the BBD; such lists may play, forthe user, the role of a catalog representing the runningstate of the BBD.In the BBD for every lexeme or semantic featureall the documents are mentioned that contain somelexicographically useful information about thatlexeme or feature.
In contradistinction to all the ex-isting bibliographic catalogs, our BBD contains bibli-ographic information about individual lexemes,cf.Krylov 198~).The vocabulary consists of some 12.500 words.Morphological information istaken from the diction-ary Zalizniak 1977.As for syntactic and semantic information, usual-ly it cannot be found in existing dictionaries.2~ SEMANTIC  FEATURE ACCORDINGTO U.WEINREICHSemantic features are the main subject of thepresent paper.
The notion of semantic feature isassociated, in the first place, with the name ofU.Weinreich (1967), who proposed a useful distinc-tion between a paradigmatic semantic feature (ap -p rox imate ly  as in componential nalysis, cf.Bendix1965 ) and a transfer feature.
This distinction made itpossible to use the notion of semantic feature in abroader sense than in transformational grammar(TG) where semantic features are strictly opposed tosyntactic ones, namely, to selection features and tofeatures of strict categorization: i  TG semantic fea-tures do not take part in formulation of grammaticalrules.In Weinreieh's conception semantic feature ser-ves several different purposes:1) it is regarded as a basis of semantic agreement(as in well known examples pretty girl vs. *pretty man;a year ago vs. *a house ago; before breakfast vs. *beforeJohn etc.
);- 194  -2) it explains deviant and metaphorical readings(as in a grief ago, before the wall etc.
);3) it adds provisional semantic ontents to apotentially ambiguous word in order to imposesemantic agreement where strictly speaking (i.e.under literal interpretation) there is none; thus, inexample (1), from Be~Hpeflx 1981, p.159, the wordho__uuse, with the inherent semantic feature \[-Time\],acquires in the given context feature \]+Time\] as atransfer feature imposed by the governing verb occur;as a result, the word house is interpreted as an event,e.g., as an event of somebody's perception of a housewhile passing by: (1) A red house occurred twice.In example (2), from BeflHpefix 1981, p.159, theword craft acquires the feature \[+Aircraft\], as a trans-fer feature imposed by the verb.to .fl_F(2) They flew the craft.Thus, following Weinreich, we divide semanticfeatures into two groups.
Categorial feature of a word(usually, of a noun) is understood as its own charac-teristics, possibly, as a common property of itsreferents; cf.
such features as \[+ Person\] or \[+ Place\]of the words man and house correspondingly.
Tran-sitive feature of a word (usually, of a predicate) is asemantic ondition imposed on one of the arguments- namely, on the semantic necessity of its presence inthe utterance with the given word and on its categorialfeatures.
Thus, verbs of emotional state, such as t..Rohope, possess the following transitive feature: theirsubject (necessarily existent) has a categorial feature\[ + Person\].
Verbs of motion must have at least oneargument with the categoriai feature \[ + Place\], etc.3.
SEMANTIC  FEATURES IN SYSTEMSOF  NATURAL LANGUAGEPROCESSING (NLP)Semantic features belong to obviously significantNLP resources having no equivalents in existing dic-tionaries.
The following problems of NLPi may belisted where semantic features are constantly madeuse of:1.
Revealing predicate-argument relations inparsing algorithms: categorial features of the argu-ment should agree with the transitive featurepredicted for this argument by the predicate.
As ispointed out in AnpecaH ed al.
1989, p.261, "in manycases adequate identification of a syntactic onstruc-tion relies upon semantic agreement ofwords" Thus,semantic features can make a substantial contributionin syntactic parsing.~2.
Disambiguation f a lexicallyhomonymous predic~-6"word: categorial feature of anargument may help in choosing the right lexical mean-ing of the predicate; cf.J(._._.3) a.Oxna rocTan~ttbtBHXOj~$1T Ha ~or ;b. l'\]eTfl BblXO,I~HT Ha ay~xafiKy.In (a) the word .rocT~HX_U~a 'hotel' has a categorialfeature \[-Movable\]; hence the stative meaning of theverb n_~xoztnr~ 'go out'.
In (b) Ma.ab'mK 'boy' has thefeature \[+Movable\] and the verb ~h~xg.&~.Tb has itsusual meaning of a verb of motion.3.
Disambiguation of a lexically homonymousnoun by addressing transfer features of the predicate.Thus, semantic features are usable for disambignationof words in context.4.
Combinability of verbs with adverbials desig-nating time, place, reason, purpose, instrument etc.,always rely upon some sort of semantic oncord, cf.Paducheva, Rakhilina 19JD.
E.g., the adverbial ofpurpose is only possible in the context of a verbdenoting controlled action and, consequently, havingan agent endowed with free will.
If this condition isnot fulfilled, the adverbial of purpose sounds deviant(cf.
*J\]~a onaaTm npoeaaa y BOJ\]\[HTPdI$1 HMesyrca anpo~axe a6oneMeHTmae KHH.,~KetIKH: the adverbialof purpose is out of place here because HMewrca anpo~a~e does not denote an action).
The time adver-bials denoting exact time (Fla~y,~eaa 1988a) are ex-cluded, on semantic grounds, in the context of suchnon-action verbs as orlo3,~3Tb,OTffraTb, 3aTflHyTbC$1< o no~c.naz~e >, coxpaHHTbCg etc.5.
In the course of analysis of coordinate construc-tions it is often necessary tocarry out a transformationopposite to conjunction reduction, and semanticagreement is what gives a hint as to how this transfor-mation is to be fulfilled.6.
Semantic features may be useful in the proce-dure of revealing anaphoric relations in the text, cf.example from Dahlgren, McDowell 1986: (4) The catdid not drink the milk.
It spilled.As the verb to spill presupposes a subject whichis a liquid, the pronoun may be unambiguously as-sociated with the milk and not with the cat.7.
Transfer semantic features may be used todistinguish texts allowing for literal interpretationsfrom deviant or metaphoric (as in the sea smiled).4.
SEMANTIC  FEATURES ANDSELECT ION RESTRICT IONS INLEX ICON AND GRAMMARIn early 60-ies semantic features were almostunique theoretical instrument ofsemantic analysis.
Aprogress in semantic theory achieved in the 70-ies andin the 8.0-ies (in the first place in works of Ju.Apresjan(1974) and A.Wierzbicka (1972), connected in thefirst place with semantic decomposition of lexicalmeanings, drew the notion of semantic feature aside,to a secondary and a more modest position.
Semanticfeatures were regarded at best as a subsidiary meansin systems of NLP, el.
Anpecan H ~tp.
1989.
Now Iargue that the notion of semantic feature deserves amore prominent place, even in the context of modernintricate "garden variety" semantics.The fact is that in many cases semantic featurescan be interpreted as a label for one or more semanticcomponents in the semantic decomposition of alexeme.I am inclined to think that it is the semanticfeature and not the syntactic one that plays the leadingrole in regulating selection restrictions in lexicon andgrammar.- 195  -Anna Wierzbicka in her book "Semantics ofgrammar" takes an ambitious task - to present allselection restrictions in grammar as motivated bysome semantic features of words and constructions:"grammatical distinctions are motivated <...>bysemantic distinctions" (Wierzbicka 1988, p.3).
Whilenot wholly agreeing with this thesis, we can add somearguments in its favor.
Here arc several examples ofselection restrictions that are usually considered tobepurely syntactic, i.e.
demanding Icxical ists, and whichcan be proved to be semantically motivated, namely,motivated by some semantic component ofa word orof a grammatical construction.EXAMPLE 1.
In 3am4aaaK, I'laayuena 1987 asemantic characterization was proposed for the classof predicates allowing Neg-Raising.
Such Neg-Rais-ing predicates as to believe <that> possess twosemantic features: \[+Incompatibility of contraries\](you cannot believe that P and simultaneously believethat not-P, though, e.g., you can assume that P andsimultaneously assume that not-P) and \[+ Excludedneutrality\] (I do not think that P is out of place in thecontext when I never gave it a thought - whether P ornot-P).EXAMPLE 2.
In ApyTmaona 1988 it was shownthat Russian conjunctions qTo 'that' and KaK 'as' obeythe followingrulc of semantic distribution: qTO is usedafter verbs with the semant ic  component'know/believe' (cf, similar considerations aboutEnglish that in Wierzbicka 1988) and Kag - after wordswith the component 'perceive', cf.
I;1 noMam, '~TO M~TaM Kyna.al4Cb and fl noMmo, KaK MU TaM Kynam4cb.EXAMPLE 3.
In rla~yqena 1988b the semanticinvariant isrevealed for the class of predicates capableof introducing indirect question or its equivalent -parameter word; cf.
I know why he arrived; I knowthe reason of his arriva!
, on the one hand, and *!.believe why h~ ca_me, *.I believe the reason of his arrival- on the other (this problem was stated in Vendler1981).
It is the semantic component 'X knows' that isresponsible for this semantic option.5.
ON SEMANTIC  IN-VARIANT OF  THECLASS OF  WORDS WITH GENIT IVESUBJECTOur main object of attention in this paper isthdconstruction with genitive subject in Russian :OTBeTa He npnm~o, Mopoaa He qyncTnyeTc~,KaTaCTpOdp~ He nponaomao.
Note that in some casesnominative is also possible: OTuer ne npamea,Mope3 He qyncTnona~ca.In Apresjan 1985 it is claimed that the choice ofthe case of the subject in this construction is deter-mined by a syntactic feature of a verb, and that thissyntactic feature must be ascribed to the correspond-ing group of verbs (cf.
npoaaoATa\];verb forms -mainly, passive forms (cf.
Ha6.am~aTbCg,qynCTnonarbc~) or predicatives (cf.
na~xo, c.nNmno)in the dictionary.
The list is supposed to~ontain morethan two hundred items.
These words, as Apresjanbelieves, possess ome semantic affinity, but this af-finity is not sufficient for reliable prediction of the caseof the subject: the list of words is supposed to be theonly thing thai is necessary and suffid~t.This thesis is demonstrated by the following dif-ferences insyntactic behavior of semantically cognatepairs of verbs:(5) a. CTapOCT~ na cO6paHaa ue 6z~z.ao,b.
*CTapOCT,,, na co6panaa He npacyTCTeOBa.ao.
(6) a. HonopoTa n nocTanonge TeXnHqeCKOflnponaram1~a HenacTynnmob .
*rlonopoTa B nocTaHon~e TeXHHqeCKOI~nponaraaau He Haqa.rlOCb,(7) a. CHMHTOMOB 6oaeaaa He noslni~Laocl,.b.
*CHMHTOMOB 6021eaHH e Hcqc3JIO.We claim that different choice of the case of thesubject in these xamples has a semantic explanation.Verbs that can be used with genitive subject will becalled genitive verbs.
Now we claim that the set ofgenitive verbs (more precisely, the set of meaningsthese verbs have when used with a genitive subject)has a semantic invariant.There are two semantic omponents, differentbut cognate, such that at least one of them is alwayspresent in every negative sentenc~ with the genitivesubject construction.
Correspondingly, there are twosemantic groups of genitive verbs.
In group i genitivesubject in a negative sentence is explained by the factthat the corresponding sentence without negationcontains a semantic omponent 'X cxists',whcre Xstands for the referent of the subject NP (or 'X takesplace' - if the subject NP does not denote any objectbut rather a process or an event).
An importantcondition is that this essential component should have- in the semantic representation f a sentence - thestatus of an assertion or an implication (according toKarttunen 1973): it must not have the status of apresupposition.
Now, if the semantic representationof the non-negative s ntence contains a propositionof the form 'X exists' and if this proposition does nothave the status of a presupposition of this sen-tence,then under negation (of the whole sentence)proposition 'X exists' will be negated.
It is exactly thissemantic omponent - negation of existence of X, -that is "responsible", in the 1-st group of genitivevcrbs, for the genitive subject.If the meaning of the verb does not predict un-ambiguously whether the presupposition f existencemust or must not be present in the semantic repro-se~ntation of a sentence then both genitive andn6mina/tive subjects are possible: negative sentenceswith the nominative and with the genitive subject willhave different meanings:(8) a~(OTneT npume.a) =OTaeT ae npame.n (theexistence of the answer is presupposed);b.~(Hpumea OTne'r) = OTneTa ne npnmao ( theexistence of the,answer is not presupposed).In examples (9)-(11), where only genitive subjcctis: possible in a negative sentence, proposition 'Xexists' cannot have the status of presupposition - it isalways an implication; thus, the case of the subject isgenitive:(9) a.

*3axpy~tHenast He noanngaa~(11) a. PaaHrlRbl ie ycMaTpasaerca~b.
*Paanatta He yc~arpnnaerca.Nominative is only possible as an "aggressive"stylistic variant corresponding toa newly born norm,as in(12) ~oronopeaaoc'rb He ~oc'rllrrlyTa,It is much better to say RoroaopenHocra nelloc'rnrnyTo.In group Ii genitive subject is predicted by acomponent 'X is present in the field of vision of anobserver'.
When negated, this component has thefollowing form: 'X is not present in the field of visionof the observer'.
It is this component that is respon-sible for the genitive subject in the second group ofgenitive predicates.On the contrary, Nominative case of the subjectin the context of verb of group I!
expresses the presup-position that the object is present at the place men-tioned, but is not accessible to perception:(13) a~l(~epenna x~xa) = ~epena~ ne nxzxa.6.q(Bngna ;aepe11Ha) = ~epesaa He !i11/11tO.Semantic omponents responsible for the geni-tive subject in group I and in group II are cognate.
Infact, proposition 'X is not present in the field of visionof the observer' often has a conversational implicature- 'And I doubt whether X exists at all'.
In other words,the absence of the object in the field of vision castsdoubt on the very fact of its existence.
This implicatureimpends itself if the subject can only occupy the placethat the speaker has in mind.
Then if the subject is notperceived in this place it does not exist at all, as inMopoaa ae qyllcrnyeTc~.
For persons who can oc-cupy different places, the problem does not arise.Thus when stating(14) Mama ne BH/IHO <a~ecb>the speaker does not call in question the existenceof Masha.Thus, our semantic invariant of the class of sen-tences with a genitive subject makes it possible tocharacterize semantically the class of genitive verbs;moreover, this invariant makes it possible: to stateconditions (on sentence structure) under which geni-tive subject is excluded, inspite of the fact that the verbbelongs to the class of genitive verbs.
Thus, we getexplanation of the role of such factors (mentioned inBabby 1980) as- -  animate vs. inanimate subject;referentiality vs. non-referentiality of the sub-ject;topic-focus articulation of the implied non-negative sentence;presence vs. absence of the observer.To recapitulate, our example shows that there is,though indirect, connection between selectionalrestrictions and semantic features of the word, i.e.semantic omponents of its semantic decomposition.REFERENCESAnpecan IO.\]L .rleKcHqecxasl ceMaHTHKa.
