SRI'S REAL-TIME SPOKEN LANGUAGE SYSTEMPatti Price and Robert C. MooreSRI InternationalMenlo Park, CA 94025PROJECT GOALSThis project involves the integration of speech and natural-language processing for spoken language systems (SLS).
Thegoal of this project, to develop a multi-modal interface to theOfficial Airline Guide database, is being developed along twooverlapping research and development lines: one focussed on anSLS kernel for database query, and the other on the full interac-tive system.RECENT RESULTSSpeaker-dependent andspeaker-independent mos to illus-trate the combined recognition/natural language system andaccompanying graphical user interfaces.Improved robustness through the development of a templatematcher for generating database queries; the templatematcher has a tunable parameter tocontrol how much con-straint is ignored, so that wrong answers can be traded withno answers.Implementation f a bottom-up arser for CLE-formalismgrammars; the new parser is about wice as fast as our origi-nal left-corner parser, and about 17 times faster than an ini-tial bottom-up arser.Exploration of two schemes to integrate the recognizer andcurrent NL schemes: N-best recognition with a statisticalgrammar, and recognition guided by a probabilistic finite-state representation f the templates.Evaluation of SRI's NL, SLS, and speech recognition tech-nologies.
SRI's February-91 weighted sentence rror ratefor ATIS Class A sentences was 33.8% (NL) and 44.1%(SLS); word error rate for the Resource Managementspeaker independent speech recognition evaluation was17.6% with no grammar and 4.8% with the standard word-pair grammar.Improvements in the CLE grammar: extended coverage ofnumerical expressions, ATIS domain sortal restrictions, andconjoined noun phrases.Implementation of tied-mixture hidden Markov models,which resulted in a 20% reduction in the word-error ratecompared to the discrete-density version.Training of a discrete-density DECIPHER using 20,000sentences of read and spontaneous speech from ResourceManagement, TIMIT, and ATIS corpora.
We achieved 10%word error on the June-90 ATIS test set.New techniques for statistical language models: a back-offestimation algorithm, Good-Turing estimates, and interpola-tion of word-based grammars with class-based grammars.Current est-set perplexity ranges from 15 to 30.Initial implementation f fast-search recognition algorithmsfor near eal-time recognition.Initial implementation of speaker-adaptation using tied-mixture codebook adaptation.Implementation f an HMM reject-word model for dealingwith noises and out-of-vocabulary items in digit recognitiontasks; we plan to incorporate his in our ATIS SLS.PLANS FOR THE COMING YEARContinue data collection and analysis and expand the ATISdomain.Implement a new architecture tocombine the advantages ofthe robust emplate matcher with the new bottom-up arser.The parser will feed individual constituents o the templatemateher, even if it cannot find a complete interpretation fan utterance, and will also form the basis of a phrase-levelstatistical language model to guide recognition (see Jacksonet aL, this volume).Continue efforts in statistical language modeling: Deter-mine why low perplexity systems do not always improveaccuracy; Develop means for making efficient use of lan-guage-model training data, and for using out-of-task train-ing data; Combine statistical language modeling withfinguistic models of syntax and semantics.Improve acoustic modeling performance: consistency mod-eling, speaker-adaptation, rejection modeling (includingalternative topologies and training techniques), spontaneousspeech phenomena (variations in phonology and speakingrate), corrective training; Implement a continuous-distribu-tion version of DECIPHER.425
