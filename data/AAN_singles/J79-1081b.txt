Properties of Lex+cal Rezations.a, R e f l d v i t y ,  Symmetry, Transitivity.Certain properties of l e x i c a l - s e w t i c  relations can be  very use-ful i n  deductive inference.
For instance, 15 we know that a cheetahis a ki,na or mammal anu a mamm i.s a kind of vertebrate then we candeduce that a cheetah is  a kind of vertebrate.
Writing T f o r  the taxonomyrelat ion,  w e  can abbreviate this sentence: if cheetah T mammal and mam-mal T vertebrate then cheetah T vertebrate.
Whenever bTc and cTd, itfollcaws that bTd.
This fact ran be described much more effi ciently bythe stuement that the taxonomy relat ion i s  transitive.
Two other commonlymenttand properties of  relations are refilexivity and syrmnetry.
Theseproperties may ppply t o  predicates formed from lexical entries as w e l las to lexical-semantic relat ions .To be precise, a relation R defined on a s e t  S is  s a i d  t o  be at rana~t<ve  relation if whenever b and c are R-related and also c and dare I?
related then b and d staAd in a re lat ion  R a l so ,  Synonyniy is atransitive relat ion just as trans i t iv i ty  i s .
The preposition in behavesin the same way.
If Sam is in the kitchen and the kitchen is  i n  thehote l ,  then w e  know that Sam is i n  the hote l .
The t i m e  interrelationbefore behaves like th i s ,  too.
If Zorro arrived before the posse didand the  posse arrived before thz explosion, then w e  know thgt Zorroarrived before the explosion.A re lat ion R defined on a set S is said to have the refZez<ue pro-perty if all the elements of S are R-related to thenl~elves, that is, ifmRm is true for all members m of the set S, The synonymy relation hasthis property a word means the same thin% as itself.
The antonymyrelation ANTI does not have this property.
It is not rrue tha&, hotANTI be, for example.A relation R def ined on a set S is said t o  be e ~ s t r i c  if when-ever,b and c are R-related then so are c and b; that is, R is symme.tricif and only i f  bRc always implies cRb.
Synonymy also has this  property.If b is synonymous with c,  then c is synonymous with b.
So has antonfly.Given that hot ANTI sold, we immediately know that= c d d  ANTI hot.
Tax-onomy ie not eymmetric, however.
A lion is a kind of mammal, but amammal is not a kind of lion.In question answering we may b e  just as Interested in drawing nega-tive conclusions as positive-ones.
Thus i~rmay be important to know tliattf bRc is true then cRb must be falae.
The term asynmrstrio is used todescribe a re la t ion  R f o r  w h i c h  b R c  and cRb are never both true, at$east when b and c are different elements of the stt S. Taxonomy isasymmetric and so is the thug interrelation before.
If the questionasks, "Did c happen before b?"
and we know that b happened before r, wecan answer with a confident no.
For want of a better term we w i l l  saythat the r e l r  Sion R is mn-synonetrio if it is neither symmetric or &sym-metric.
In this  case bRc and cRb are sometimes both true and sometfmesnot.
S h i l a r l y ,   he term imefz.exive i s  used for  the case i n  which mRmis never true, while the term nonreflexit)e is used for the case in whichmRm i s  s o m e t f m e s  true and sometimes not.
In the same way i n t r a n s i t i ~ eis taken to mean that if bRc and cRd, we can conclude that b and d arenot R-related, while nantrcrnsitive will mean that bRd is sometimes trueif bRc and cRd, but- not always.Each lexical relation itself; has a lexical entry.
The reflexivity,symmetry, and transitivity properties of the relation are listed in thisentry, as they are in the entries for interrelational operators andprepositions and other lexical item for which they are relevant.
Thereare also lexical entries under the property names, r e f l d v s ,  i r r ~ ~ ~ ~ v r ,etc.
l i s t i n g  the appropriate axioms.
The motivation behind l a i c a l  en-tries for properties is first of a l l  greater generality.
Secondly, i tmakes it much easier to add lexical relations and to add other propertieswhich turn out to be useful .A t  this  stage of development there are several transitivity axioms:For lexical relations Rel, like taxonomyb Re1 c c Re4 d ' b Re1 dFor i n t e r r e l a t i o n s  J ,  like bsfbrelloZdsfI(~,~,,Z,)) A RoZda (I(J, Z2,Z3)) Holds (I(J,Z~ ,z$)For prepositions Q like in or abaveIntuitively these are a l l  instances of the same concept, t rans i t iv i ty .Theze should be  some s ingle  way of expressing it.
It is  a defect of th i srepresentation system that there is no t .A relation that i s  reflexive, symmetric, and transitive Ls calledan equivalence relation.
The synonymy relation i s  an equivalence relationsince i t  has a l l  three properties.
If R i s  an equivalence relation, thena subset consistrlng of a l l  the elements which are R-related t o  a parti-rtllar element x by the7equivalence relation i s  called an equivalence c l a s s .In an equivalence class all the elements are R-related t o  each other.
An equivaf ence r e l a t i o n  partitions a set i n t o  equivalence classes ; each elemento f  the set  belongs t o  exactly one equivalence claas.
The synonymy re-lation p a f t i t i o n s  the items in the lexicon Ln j u s t  th i s  way.
There I sa class consisting of stcsp%oion and all the words synonymous with 8148-phion,  like mistmcet and dozibt.
These synonymy classes are disjoint;each word sense in the lexicon belongs t o  exactly one of them (cf.Edrrmndson and Epstein 1972, Palmer 1976).With t h i s  ge a bas i s  an equivalence relation of paxaphrasabilitybetween sentences can be established.
Sentence S1 is a paraphrase ofsentence S2 if one is obtained from the other 3y substituting synonymsfor each other.
dMr.
Kennedy viewed Lady Laura with suspicion.Mr.
Kennedy regarded Lady Laura with mistrust.We might also allow substitution of conversives, nominalizations, etc.Nancy was Sally's student.Sally was ~ancy's teacher.S a l l y  taught Nancy.The equivalence classes of this relation, each one of which is the setof all pamaphrases of a given sentence have a definite theoretical im-portance and some practical significance in question answering.
Onemember of a class might well 'be part of the story; another the rightanswer to* a question.- -I This representation system can be viewed as defining a relation Psuch that S1 P S2 if and only if S1 and S2 have the same representa-t ion .
If t h e  representation system is well d e f i n e d ,  then P shoulddefine the same equivalence classes as the paraphrasabilitv relatiorb.
Xttt)srses,The inverse R of the  re la t ion  R is  the re la t ion  which "goes inthe opposite direction" from R; that i s ,  bRc i f  and only if cRb.
Thus,bake T make and m k e  T bake are two ways of saying the same thing.
Bothpieces of information are stated in the lexicon.
However, the lexicalentry f o r  Eake includes T nuke; the lexical entry f o r  naks includes Thake.
Why bother to say the same thing in different places?
There aretwo reasons f o r  th i s .
First of all, the inversa relation may be a re-lat ion that is conm~nly and easily verbalized, worth naming i n  its ownright.
This is certainly true o f  the CHILD relation, as in pu~py CHILD20g.
Instead of asking "What i s  a baby dog called?
", we could ask ''Whatis a g r o w ?
puppy talled?"
or "What does a puppy grow up t o  be?"
Thesecond reason is that putting t h i s  information in both entries can &esearches easier  and much fas ter ,  We may only have one half o f  the pairand need the other.
We may have dog and pppy .
This is easy if we havethe information CHILD p p p z ~  i n  the dog entry.
Othewise we might haveto search the whole lexicon, In other s i tuat ions  we have two words butno direct connection between them.
For example, suppose the system knowst w n  T m a m a 2  and m a Z  T vertebrate and i s  then asked, "Is a l i o n  avertebrate?"
The connection betwen Zion and vertebrate can be foundmuch more quickly if the search starts *om both the vertebrate end andthe Zion end of the chain at the same time, but to do t h i s  there mustbe s pointer to  m~mmaZ in  the oertebrute entry.
Another question comes-to mind.
Why c a l l  t h e  inverse relation t o  CHILD by the  clumsy name C A a Dinstead of its propel name PARENT?
The ECD uses t ~ o  different names fora relation and its inverse (So and Vo ace inverses, for example).
Ifth i s  were dane here, two versions of the appropriate axiom schemes wouldbe needed, one in the CHILD entry and one in the P M N T  entry.Since a relation R is called symmetric if bRc alwaye implies cRb, itfollows that a symmetric relation ie its own inverse.
The syaonymy re-lation S and antonymy relation ANTI are both self-inverse i n  t h i e  sense.- 7For this  reason we never need the spnbol ANTI, etc.
ANTI is MITI Theentry for hot includes ANTI cold, the entry for cold includes ANTI hot.0.
(hrique Linkage.Raphael (1968) has proposed a property which seems extremely useful .He calls i t  m6qus-Z$nkuge (U).

Wecan define UL unique-linkage on the left and UR unique linkage on thef i g h t .
(A relation which is UR is a single-valued function.
If R hasthe UL property, then its inverse is a single-valued function.

Pmtial Ordering.Any transitive relation defines a partial ordering.
Several of thelexisgl relatiohs discueeed earl,ier are transitive; many lexical itemsare transitive too.
One important reason for.repr*senting time interns of the transit ive interrelatEton before is  to allow one t o  make thesame kinds of sdmple deductions about time that one can make about taxon-omy.
Some transitive relations,  l i k e  taxonomy, are alsb reflexive.
Inth is  case we talk about a weak order<ng.
(X s: Y for numbers i s  a weakordering.)
Some are not ref lexive ,  these are called strong orderingre la t ions .
(X < Y for numbers i s  a strong ordering.)
The time re la t ionbefore 5s a strong order3ng relation.
For any weak ordering there is astrong ordering and conversely, Starting with the taxonomy relation T,1 I f o r  example, a relation TI or proper,taxonomyl' can be defined consistingof the pairs x and y for which xTy but x and y are different.
T h e n ~ T l ymeans that x is a kind of y but different from y.
If instead one startswith strong ordering relation before, one can deane a weak r e l a t i o n"beforel" for which x beforel y means that either x before y or x cooccuredwith y .The queuing relation Q i s  nat i t s e l f  a partla3 ordering but a partialordering can 'be derived from it.

INTRODUCTIONDuring the p a ~ t  15 years.
scientists in many f i e l d s  havebeen b u i l d i n g  a reservoir of knowledge about the semantic characteristics of natural language.
Perhaps somewhat inexplicablyznese developments have for the most p a r t  Agnored the semanticcontenl of dictionaries, despi te  the fact that even a small onecontain8 a vast amount of material.
Some attempts have beenmade t o  d e n t  these repositories, but t h e  steps  t'aken have beententat ive and have n o t  y e t  borne s ign i f i can t  f r u i t ,  perhaps be-cause che sheer volume and scope of a dictionary is so over-whelming.
As a r e su l t ,  most s tudies  have dealt with only a f e wdefinitions wj%hout a comprehensive assault on the whole.
Whilesuch studies  have led t o  many insights,  i t  seems tha t  the f u l lugerulness of a dictionary's cantents will be realized onlywhen a comprehensive model of its semantic structure is d w e l -oped,Any system intended t o  provide natural language under-standing must necessarily include a d i c t i o n a ~ .
If any suchsystem i s  to achieve broad applicability, its dictionary lnustcover a substantial p a t  of the n a t u r a l  language lexicon.
F o rthis to occur, the developers of a system must e i t h e r  c r ea t e  adictionary from scratch or be able to incorporate an existingdictxonary.
Given the amount of effort that usually goes intodevelopment of an ordinary dictionary, the former a1 ternativeis r a t h e r  impractical.
Bowever, l i t t l e  has been done towardmeetinn the l a t t e r  alternative; with w n a t  f o l l o w s ,  I will7describe the approach which I bel ieve must b e  followed intransforming the contents of an ordinary dictionary for us6 Ina true naturaX language system,In order to be used in a language understanding system, adictionary's semantic contents must be systematized in a wayt ha t  the sense in which a word i a  being used can be identified.Bbfore t h i ~  can be done, it is necessary to characterize what1s already cantained in each definition.
To do this, it seemsnecessary t o  write the meaning of each definition in terms ofserpantic and syntac5ic primitives.
My purpose in this paper i a( 1 )  to describe how to use the dictionary i t s e l f  to move towardidhntification of the primitives, at the same time ( 2 )  showinghow t h i s  process can be used (a )  to provide the capability fordiscriminating among word senses ( i. e. characterizing; t heframes i n t o  which a given word sense w i l l  fit) and (b) t o  char-acteriee knowledge contained or presupposed in a def ini t ion.Before elhbarking on the descr ip t ion ,  i t - $ 8  necessary tcpaint out  some limitations whZch s h a a d  be kept in mind as Dhereader proceeds.
First, in t r y i n g  to @resent  an overview of myapproach, I have had to forgo describing the  d e t a i l e d  stepswhich I have fol lowed to date .
Second, even had I presented afull descr ipt ion ,  I would still have been short of  providingsufficient deta i l s  to enable computer implementation of anyprocedures.
Third, Since the approach presumgs t h a t  canceptsrepresented by the lexicon are t n e  rea l izat ions  of many as y e tunknovin-rrecursive functions t o  be dl scovered by s tr ipping  away8one- layer  at a t ~ m e ,  results other  than procedures  t o  be usedAn stripplpg will not emerge untll a l l  l ayers  have been re-moved.
(However, I do wrae t h a t  the l l s t r ipp lngm procedures areinhe ren t ly  useful ,  in t h a t  they will constitute a parser evenin t h e  intermea~ase stages.)
Fourth, s ince  I have n o t  ha@ ac-cess t o  a computer, which has  become essentlalLfor s igni f icantfurther progress, I have been unable t o  determine how far thegrocedures I have developed would take me, so there iLs an in-herent uncertain-ty as to how much further development a s  needed.Notw~thstandlng these l i m i t a t i o n s ,  I am hopeful t h a t  what isprenented will provide a satisfactof .y framework for f u r t h e r  iLn-vest igat ions  i n t o  the contents o f  dictlonarles.
I will commentf u r t h e r  on these limitahions and h o w  they might be overcome atthe end of the  paper.2, ATTITUDB'3 TOWARD DICTION4RIE5Many of +he siqnifxcant contributors to the present under-standxng o f  rneanlng (such as Xatz and Fodor 1963, Plllmore 1968and - 7971, CHafe 1970, Jackendoff 1974, wlnograd 1972, andSchank 9972) have general ly  lgnored dictlonarles.
Yet, each haspresented a formulai~ structure for l ex i ca l  entrhe5 to serve asa bas= f o r  t h e  c rea t ion  of a rlew dictionary 4lthough t h e i rperceptions abouti the nature  of language are well-established,thei?
formellsms f o r  lexxcal entr ies  have not taken advantageof the equally well-establ~shed praetlces of lexicography.The rationale underlslng the development of new fommalisms~e x ~ r e r ~ s e d  in some cases and ~ m ~ l l c r t  t;n others, ids that lexlcal9entries in dictionaries a m  unsatisfactory DeCAuse they do n o tcontain sufficient in fomat ion .
These formali-sms thus requiret h a t  semantic f ea tu re s  such as 1lanirnateft or " s t a t e w  be appended*to p a r t i c u l a r  ent*ies.
While it is true tha t  ordinary d i o t i o -nary entries  do not overt ly  identify a l l  appropriate features,t h i s  may be lees a dlfficulhg inherent in definitions than thefact thst  no one has developed the necessary mechanisms f o rsurfacing features from definitions.

In general, it seems t h a t ,  if a semantic feature isessential to the meaning o f a  particular entry, it is s i m i l a r l ynecessary %Hat the feature be discoverable within the semanticstructure of a dictionary, Otherwise, there is a defect in oneor more d e f i n i t i o n e ,  or t he  dictionary- contains  some in te rna linconsistency.
(Clearly, it is beyond expectation that  any pre-~ n t  dictionary will be free of these problems.
)The p o s s i b i l i t y  of defective definitions has a l so   gene^--ated crf t i c iams ,  more direct than above, on the potential  use-fulness Of a dictionary.
On one Hand def ini t ions  are viewed as"deficient in the presentation of relevant dataw since theyprovide meanin- bv ueing "substitutable words ( i .
e .
by syn-onyms), rather than by listing d i s t i n c t i v e  femtureafl (Nida1975 : 172) .
On another hand-, the proliferation of meanings10attached to an entry is viewed as only a case of "apparentpolyeenyN which obscures the more general meaning of a lexemeby the addition of "redundant features already determined bythe environmentft (Bennett 1975:4-1.1).
Both objections may havemuch v a l i d i t y  and ts that extent would necessitate revisions toiqdividu& or sets of definitions.
However, neither viewpointis sufficient' t o  preclude an analysis of what actually appearsin any dictionary.
It is poss ib le  that a cbmprehensive analysismight more r e a d i l y  surface such d i f f i c u l t i e s  and make theiramelioration (and the consequent improvement of definitions)that mu& easier,Xven though dictionaries are viewed somewhat askance bymany who study meaning, it seems t h a t  this viewpdint is inf lu-enced more by the d i f f i c u l t y  o* systematically tapping theircontents than by m y  substantive objections which conclusivelye s tab l i sh  themas ~ s e l e s s  repositories of semantic content.However, it is necessary to demonstrate tha t  a spstematicapp~oach ex i s t s  and can y i e l d  useful results.3 ,  PREVIOUS RESXARCN ON DICTXONARIESNotwithstanaing the foregoing direct and indirect  c r i t i -cisms.

A review of relevant as-pects QI- two such s t u d u s  will help the niaterial presented heres tand out in sharper re l i e f .Olney 1968 describes the conceptual baa i s  of many pro$eett-ed routines for processing a machine-readable transcript of11Webster ' s Seveqth New Collq&ate Dictionary ( ~ 7 ) .

As a\ r e s u l t ,  an8 routinesthat are developed seem t o  require the serendipitous percept ionof patterns.

Thi s  p rocess  was never actuallycarried out  because ( 1 )  not a l l  words in a dictionary were usedin the  computer files, ( 2 )  the process was terminated when acommon word was found in comparing the meanings of two words,and ( 3 )  t h e r e  was a b e l l e f  that t h e r e  are no primitive wardconcepts.
The termination of a search 3x designed was necessaryin any event s ince ,  wi thout  m y  restrictions, it is l i k e l y  thata l a rge  p a r t  of the dhz t ionary  would have been reached on everyoccasion, More impor tan t ly ,  Quillian did not f u l l y  considerw H a t  was happening when branching led to a word already encoun-tered,  namely, t ha t  a definitional circularity was thereby un-covere6 Such c i r c u l a r i t i e s  which mi-ght be vic ious  cir-cles,must be treatea specia l ly  (as w i l l  be shown below) ,  and hence,Quillian8 s unrestricted branching should have been mdi fbed .Quill ian also overlooked the.

The part-of-speech labels ,  status or usage l a b e l s ,  andusage notes are considered integral to the definitions and maybe viewed as p a r t  of a s e t  of characteristics of the individualdefxni t ions .

This ap-proach does n o t  capture some very important elements that  go tomake up a definition.Instead of being analyzed d i r e c t l y  i n t o  its ultimate con-st i tuents ,  a6 in Figures 1 and 2, the d e f i n i t i o n ,  "the act o fspreading abroad", should fir-.,st be br*en down i n t o  sub~hrasesand then i n t o  its ult imate q n s t f  tuen ts ,  s s in Figure  4 ,  shownon the next page.

Thug, success does n o t  require trill n~ticulat~nn ofthe parser before  any parsing i s  i n i t ~ a t e d .
The following rep-resents  genegal observations about the form o f  the  parses as  ithas emerged t h u s   fax^.The rirst s e t  of characteristics would r e s u l t  from thesyntactic parsing o f  each d e f i n i t i o n .
The purpose of t h i s  s t e pwould be simply to establ i sh  the syntactic pattern of each def-i n l t i o n .
The output o f  t h i s  s t e p  would be similar to that gen-e r a t ed  by Winoqrad (1972) in h ~ s  parser.
The 'dictionaryt forthe  parser would be the very lictionary we a r e  analyzing,  al-though only t he  main entry,  its inflectional forms ,  and itspart-of-speech label would be used in this step.
Ambiguousparsings and failures would be kicked out; the f a i l u r e s  inp a r t i c u l a r ,  would provide an exce l lent  source f o r  r e f i n l n g  theparser used by Winograd.
Clewly,  this s t e p  is fiat t r i v i a l ,  and,it might even be argued that it is beyond the  state-of-the-art.25However, by using a corpus as large as a dictimnary and bykicking out fai lures and ambiguities,  I believe t h a t  t h i s  stepwill s igni f icant3  advance the state-of-the-artThe second s e t  of characteristics would be determined froma semantic parsing of the def in i t ions ,  t h a t  is, an attempt t oi d e n t i f y  the cases snd semantic components present within eachd e f i n i t i o n .
For t h i s  study I have found t h e  fol lowinp;  d i s -tinction to be useful:  4 case is a semantic e n t i t y  which i s  notintrinsic to t h e  meaning of a word, e.g.

Despite the recc mized  de f i c i enc j  e s  of d i c -tionaries, I be3ieve that it is possible to-bring much greaterr igor  t o  such rules with evidence gleaned direct ly  fi om thed e f i n i t i o n s .
For example, - cut h a s  a definition, "penetrate w i t han ins%rurnenVt ; th i s  defin~tion irJould be parsed as having theinstrument case.
(Note a l s o  t h a t  this d e f i n i t i o n  makes the in-strument case intrinsic to c u t . )
Havnver, in most cnnen.
itwill be necessary to examine the d e f i n i t i o n s  of the  ,constituentworas.
For example, the verb kn i fe  has the definition, tf cut-with  a knifetf ;  although it is q u i t e  obvzous in t h i s  instancet h a t  a knife is an instrument, r i g o r  demands t h a t  we go to itsa e f  inltlons where we flnd, " a sample instrument .

4 greatleal  of analysls may ultimately be requlred t o  discern the  in-t r a s h  character~atics to be attached to a d e f i n i t i o n ,  but Ibeli-eve that many o f  these can come from the d i c t i o n a r y  i t s e l frather than grom ~ntuition.Although the nuaber of cases and components discussed inthe l i t e r a t u r e  is nu t  very l a r g e ,  the number of ways dn whlchthey may be expressed, at least &n English, is s lgn l f i can t lylarger.
In addi t ion ,  there i s  s l  e l l  a l a rge  amount of ambigutty,e , not every form spec .

i ca l l y  indicates the presence o f  aparticular case.
For example, a d e f j n a o n ,  " a c t  - with haste"does no$ indxcate t h a t  "hasteft An an instrument: ra ther ,  "w i thhaste" expresses a manner of act lng.
Unraveling all these nu-ances requires a great  deaE of e f f o r t .
However, it appears thata par t l ca la r ly  good source of  help i,n this endeavor might befound in the definitions of p r e p o s l t i ~ k s  (which are used pr3-m a n l y  t o  indicate sense relations).Bennett 1975 found it  possable  t o  express the meaning o fspatial  and temporal pregosit:ions ( a  high percentage o f  allprepositions) with only 23 components.
However, in Websterls.the number o f  t h e n  def ln l t i ons  is at least two ordera  of magnJ tudes hlgher.
The d ~ f f e r e n c e  seems to h e  in the  "apparenCpolysemyu vrh~ch, as Bennett says, arlses from the lnc luszon inpreposl tl onal  definltlons of "redundant f e a t u r e s  already deter-mined by the enylronment".
In other words, many preposit,ionald e f ~ n l t l o n s  contam lnformatlon about the context  surrounding27the p r ~ o s i t i o n ,  p a ~ t i c u l a r l y  what sort of entities are relatedby the prepositions.
My examination of verb def int ions  contain-i n g  prepositions haa led to the observation o f  many noticeableword patterns, i .
e .
collocations, which appear t o  be u a f u l  x hthe recognition ~f cases.
For  example, one definition o f  - afs t a t e s  that its object indicates something irom which a personor thing- is delivered".
In examining verb definitions, thereappears to be a distinct s e t  of verbs with which tnls sense isused in the f o l l o w i n g  frame f t (  transit Sve verb) ( o o j e c t )  o f  ( some-thing)".
The verbs t h a t  f i t  the s l a t  are exemplified by free,clear, rel ieve,  and - r l d .
Thus, if t h i s  pattern appears, the ob-ject of t h e  p r e p o s i t i o n  can be assigned the meaning It somethingfrom which a pe r son  or thing is bl ivered" .
cfChrough the  use ofprepos i t iona l  b f i n i t i o n s  in t h i s  way, I have therefore beenable to articulate some semantic recognition rules by which thearllst, or cage of a noun phrase the ob jec t  c P a preposition)can be identified.
My use of this technique has barely begun,so t h a t  it?
is presently unclear whether this appmach will suf-f i c e  to d i s c l d s e  a l l  t h e  c a E  informatl~n t h a t  we wish to iden-t i f y  ~ i t h  a senantic parser, but if not  it w i l l  t fer ta inly makesignificant strides toward this objective.Pars ing  of a d e f i n i t i o n  according to the greceding not ionsis s t i l l  not sufficient to i den t i fy ' t he  semantic componentswhich should be attached t o  a main entry, since much af the se-rmntic  content is only  present by virtde of -the definition'sc o n s t i t u e n t  wsrds.
Thus, a compl ete rendering of a d e f i n n i o n '  s28semantic content  must be derived from the sernantlc characte~is-t i c s  of I t s  cons t i tuen t s ,  i n  a recursive fa~hiong a l l  the waydown to t h e  primitives.
Although -identification of these  primi-t i v e s  is t h e  primary go-1 of the  aoproach being presented here,and W c e ,  intrinsically incomplete u n t i l  the analysls is com-pleted, the set o l  semantic characteristics f o r  a particulard e f i n i t i a n  can be developed as we proceed towdrd our goal.
Yodo t h i s ,  it will be necessary to articulate rules whlch indi-cate hou semantic characteristics may be transmitted from m edefinition t o  another.
An example of such a rule is: If thenoun X possesses the semantic component "animatem, and if X itithe noun genus) the nounY will also have the  component ltanimate".
Another exarhple is:If a verb X has  a definition x whlch has been parsed as havingan instrument  case, and X is the core verb of a def in i t l o r ,  y 3of Y, and y .
a l s o  has been pa r sed  as having the instrument case, Jthen the instrument in J is "a type ofs tne i~istrurnent ia xi.
jIt will also be necessary to articulate o t h e r  derivational(such as the  app l i ca t i on  of a causative derivation to a statev q b )  and transformational (such as the application of a rrer-undid transformation to any verb) rules.
This process of de-l i n e a t i n g  how semantic characteristics are trmsmitted will atfhe same time give more meaning t o  the l i n e s  o f  the diotionaryd~graph than simply "is used to definett .The t h i r d ,  and f i n a l ,  set  Q-f characteristics $hat must beattached to a definition is a s ~ e c i f i e a t i o n  of the context t ha tmust be present if t h a t  def r n ~ t l o n  intended.

THE ULTIMATE MODEL: POINTS AS CONCEPTSA t  this juncture,  i t  is necessary t o  ask whether t h epoints of the  digraph models sufficiently corl  espond t o  meaningas we wish it to be represented.
In the  two models descr ibedthus f a r ,  , the analysis of  a definition was deemed complete whenthe appropriate d e f i n i t i o n s  of the const$tuent words had beenidentdf ied.
Th i s  situation 1 s  n o t  ent i re ly ,  satisfactory, since,if a constituent word has more than one definition that applies,the  d e f i n i t i o r  being analyzed i s  subject to more than one in-t e r p r e  ba t ion  and hence may be c a l l e d  ambiguous with respect tothat constituent.
For example, if t h e  two d e f i n r t i o n s  o f  abroad,"over a wide -nrea" an4 "at l a r g e H ,  fit t h e  definition of broad-cast t o  y i e l d  e i t h e r  Itthe a c t  of  spreading over a wide  areat1 or" t h e  acd of  spreading a t  l a rge t1 ,  it i s  not  legitimate t o  ex-clude one.
This s i t u a  Lion is only a reflection of the  f ac t  thatna tura l  language is almost always somewhat ambiguous.
However,in accep t ing  t h i s  fact, i t  is necessary that we i n c o q o r a t e  itinto o u r  models,Parts of t h e  parsing system described in the l as t  sectionwill help  to discriminate and s e l e c t  those d e f i n i - t i ~ n s  of a con-s t l tuent  word whioh f i t  n given context.
As the pa r se r  is re-f ined,  the candidates for a particular context will be narrowedas descr ibed in Section 6 ,  but many ins tances  will remain wheremore than one del h i t i o n  f i t s  the context.
We might say thatany point representing more than one definition thus consti-t u t e s  an ambiguity.
Viewed d i f f e r e n t l y ,  we might a l s o  scy thatthe context is not s u f f i c i e n t  to distinguish among all t h e  def-itions of a word, In other words, we can-tbLamer the ambigu?ity on the context..We must expect  t h a t  ambiguity will be present  in the  d i c -tionary and deal wi th  it on t ha t  bas i s .
Fgr purposes of illus-tration, let us say tha t  abroad shown in FLgure 4 1s one suchpoint.
To remove such p o i n t s  from the d graph, we must make twopoints f o r  the d e f i n i t i o n  o j  broadcast ,  ope r epsmen t ing  " theact of spreading abraaditt  and one representing "the  a c t  ofspreading abroad2".
These two points use the same words for ex-pressin$ a definition and w i l l - b e  distinguishable only  by thefac t  t h a t  their underlying d e f i n i t i o n s  are d i f f e r e n t .
Becauseof t h i s  situation,  it is no l onge r  valid to say that a point ofthe model represents a d e f i n i t i o n :  rather, we w i l l  say t h a t  apoint represents a lfconceptfl.It i s  a l s o  pess ibxe  tha t  t h e  concepts represented by t w oor more points can be shown to be equivalent.
Ihe concept, *'thea c t  of spreading absoadft,  has men shown t o  be equivalent to"the act o f  spreading over a wide arealt.
If the l a t t e r  phrase-ology appears under some main ent ry ,  say distribution, thenbath it and the  d e f i n i t i o n  of broadcast would even tua l ly  be an.slyzed in t h e  same way.
We will say t h a t  both expressions mayrepresent t h e  same concept and hence a re  e q u i v a l e n t  a t  l e a s t  t ot h i s  ex ten t .
(since the-other  d e f i n i t i o n s  o f  these words wouldbe d i f  f w e n t  they  are no t  t o t a l l y  equivalent . )
This conceptw i l l  thus be represented by one p o i n t ,  labeled by e i t h e r  - broad-cas t  or distribution and equi'ra1ent.l~ verbalized as '!the a c t  o f7spreading o r  " t h e  act of spreading over  a wideThis interpretation is a r e f l e c t i o n  o f  the  f a c t  t ha t  in o r d i -nary  speech a s ing le  coacept may be verbalized in mbre than oneway,The observations in t h i s  sec t lon  l ead  t o  the following de-scription o f  t h e  'ul t imate '  model: The semantic conten t  of  ad i c t i o n a r y  may be represented by means o f  a digraph in which( 1 )  a p o i n t  represents a d i s t i n c t  concept, which may be verbal-i z e d  in more than one way and may have more than one label, andt o  which is appended a s e t  of syntactic, semantic, and usagefea tures ,  and ( 2 )  a line represents an instance b f  some one o fa s e t  of cxperators which act on the verbalizations or l a b e l s  ofa point according to the  feafures of that point t o  ield theparametric values o f  ano the r  point.

FOR FINDING THE PRIMIEIVESIn Section 3 ,  I stated tha t  the  model of a dictionaryshouid permi t Lhe transformation of each d e f i n i t i o n  i n t o  i t apqimitive- components.
Based on the pneceding d e a c r i p t l  w s .

Since  points repre-sent concepts in the  ul t imate model, it seems reasonable to as-sert t h a t  t he  p o i n t  basis of its tligraph represents the set 09prirnftive concepts out of which a l l  b thers  i r i  the dictionarymay be formed.
Based on the characteristics of the m i n t s  inthat model, i t  is possible (and perhape even necessary) tha teach pr imi t ive  cancept would be verbalized in several ways andsymbolised in several way$ (as  will be shown below) (2 )  Sincethe d ig raph  has a f i n l t e  number of points and lines, the  s e t sof primitive concepts and operators are a l s o  f i n i t e .It dllly remains Do ?find the primitive concepts; t h i s  willbe done by applying rules, based oh  the models and the parsingsystem, ta i d e n t i f y  words and d e f i n i t i o n s  which cannot %be prim-i t i v e s .
Essent ia l ly ,  the assertion t h a t  a word or d e f i n i t i o n  isnon-pr im~t ive  requires a showlng t ha t  it is derived from a morep r imi t ive  concept and tha t  a primitive cannut be derived from5834it.
These non-primitives can be s e t  aside and t h e i r  Pull syn-tactic and semantic characterization can be accamplished a f t e rthe primitives have been identified.
Although no primitiveshave yet been i d e n t i f i e t i  (since the described procedures havenot been fully applied), t h e n  form and nature w i l l  be delin-eated,To dernoqstrate the validity of my approach, 1 have b P e ~applying rules developed thus far t'o the s e t  of verbs in - Web-s te r r ' s  T h u d  New Internatronal  Dictionary ( 20,000 v e r b s  andt h e i r  111,000 definitions).
This s e t  was chosen because oftheir importance (cf.

I haveattempted to formulate my procedures w i t h  some rigor, keepingin mind the u l t i m q t e  necessity of computerieat~on.
I have de-veloped some d e t a i l e d  s p e c i f i c a t i o n s  for some of my procedures,envisioning t h e  use of computer tapes developed by Olney, buthave n o t  completed these since I do n o t  presently have acoessto a computer.Despi te  the focus  on verbs, i t  will become clear t h a twords from o the r  nnrts of speech are inextricably involved int h e  analysis.

However, there  are t o o  many instances where thed i f fe ren t i ae  of a d e f i n i t i o n  do not provide sufficient c o n t e x tto exclude a l l  but one sense ( f o r  example, many senses of - movef i t  i n t o  a definition phrased "move quickly").
In order t o  con-tinue toward the primitxves, we must sh i f t  gears s l i g h t l y  andask whether a d e f i n i t i o n  can be characterized as llcomplexv,t ha t  is, derived from more primitive elements.
For  example, onebef init ion - of - make is "cause to be", which can be l a b e l e d  ascomplex aecause it conbists  o f  a causative, component and as t a t e  component, each of which is more primitive by i t ~ e l f  thanlcause to be",The importaqqe of the notion o f  a complex definition be-comes evident when we t r y  t o  viaualiee how a primitive conceptw d .

After the application of40 6 4nuie and any Subsequent rule), the remaining graph is a fi-ndl sProng component.
( ~ e c a l l  t h a t  in a s t rong  component, f o reach t w o  points, u and v, there is a path from u t o  v and onefrom v t o  u. )
Assuming t h a t  each p o i n t  aepresents a concept (asin the ultimate model), t h e  fact that  two concepts are in t hesame s t rong  component means thdt they are e ~ u i v a l e n 4 .
In moret r a d i t i o n a l  terms, what we have i s  a definitional v ic ious  c i r -cle, .
t h a t  is, a def in i t ronal  chain which adds noth ing  to ourUndeistanding of the meahings invol ved.Using the d ig raph  of the f i n a l  s t r o n g  component, we canidentify (and examine one by one) a l l  putative definitional cy-c l e s  or v i c i o u s  c l r c l e s ;  these will f a l l  into t h r e e  classes .The f i r s t  c l a s s  will konsist of improper cycles,  whiqh can beremoved by determining t h a t  one poifit i s  more complex (andhence n o t  equivalent to the d e f i n i t i o n  from which it is derived)Further r u l e s  f o r _  c h a r a c t e r i z i n g  a definition as complex aregiven below.
The second class o f  c y c l e s  will be r e a l  viclousc i r c l e s ,  which fortunately can be removed, but only under cer-t a i n  conditions.
For example, one d e f i n i t i o n  of jockey is "ma-neuver f o r  advantage", while one definition of maneuver is"jockey f o r  positionN; these t w o  d e f i n i t i o n s  c o n s t i t u t e  a vi-c ious  circle.
In o r d e r  to remove it, t h e ~ e  must be some otherd e f i n i t i o n  o f  either verb whicn constitutes i t s  meaning; int h i s  case, i t  i s  found under maneuver, spec i f i ca l ly ,  "shiftt ac t i c s t1 .
Thus, in order t o  remove a vicious c i r c l e ,  we mustfind some way out.
If we cannot, we have the t h i r d  class ofcyc les ;  t h i s  class  will comprise %he s e t  of basic concepts.
Ifthere had been no way out f o r  the example of jockey and maneu-ver we would have said that no meaning was conveyed by e i t b e r- 9Vera, but ra the r  t h a t  the  meaning was established by use.
Thist h i r d  s e t  of cycles is what i s  sought by the procedures de-scribed i n a t h i s  paper.As mentioned above, the  crux of t h e  analysis  after the  ap-plication, ~f Rules 1 t o  4 i s  the iaenfjfication of complex con&c e p t s .

For  exam- 3 Jp l e ,  all t r a n s i t i v e  definitions of - cut would be gener ic  to adefinition in which "cut1f  i s  used with an object, even withoutnarrowing down to one definition.
The general  rule may now bes t a t e d ,Ru1.e 5.
If any d e f i n i t i o n  is identified as complex, it maybe placed in E, The n e t  effect of t h i s  r u l e  is to b r e a ~  one or1 Lmore putative cyc le s  hf equivalent definitions or concepts, en-ab l i ng  them to be transformed into a strict hierarchical orderwhich will eventually be subject to Rule 4.
Thus, the  complexd e f i r i i t i o n  and all  definitions t h a t  can be shown to be derivedtherefrom dan be placed in E, be cause they cannot be p a r t  of aprimitive cycle.Rule 5 is implemenBed only by very speci f ic  recognitionrules, which are essentially p a r t  of the parser.

In a d d i t i o n  to move I have determined t ha t ,  for- 9the manner component, the verbs  act , perform, a t e r ,  speak, ex-IIpress, behave, and many others  follow the rul e.

For example, a l ldefinitions of the forq "make aa j ec t i veq i ,  i.e.

R8LATIONSHlP TO'EFFORTS TO REPRESENT KNOWLEDGE IN FRAMESThe process whkch has been o u t l i n e d  ifi the preceding sec-t i o n s  is closely akin t o  current e f r o r t s  t o  r ep resen t  knowledgein frames.
( ~ f .
Winston 1977 for an elementary presentation* o f' this notion.)
B r i e f l y ,  a frame cons i s t s  o f  a f ixed  s e t  of argu-ments, some of which may be spec i f .
i ca l ly  related to others, andsome of which may have s p e c i f i c  values.
frame 1 s  intended to6945rppresent a stereotyped situation, with the arguinems i d e n t i f y -ing the various attributes which the situation always possesses .In terms o f  case grammar, f o r  e~ample,  a movement frame willcontain arguments or s l o t s  f o r  an agent, an instrument, and adestination.- By tying frames togeSher in s p e p i f i c  relationships,we can b u i l d  la rger  and larger  frames to represent more andmore knowledge, perhaps constructing a series of events, an in-ferencp structrye, or a de8c~4ption of a scarre.Before bnilding these large structures, it is necessary torepresent very small p ieces  of knowledge.
Heretbforc, this hasbeen done by pos tu la t ing  the components of frames to representsuch th ings  as actions and s t a t e  changes.
But- t h i s  can be ac-complished an a more rigorous basis.
Por  example, i f  we firstlocate a l l  definitions using "move" as its core verb and thenident i fy  a l l  t h e  case structures in which it 1 s  used, we w q l lhave a generalized frame which characterjzes most if not a l l  ofthe possible uses o f  *lrnove1l.
(This approach ds currently beingfo l lowed by Slmmons 1977.)
Each definition in which tlmovell isused could then be representea by the generalized frame withsome of itb s l o t s  f l l l e d .
T h i s  process can be fo l lowed f o r  anyword for which we wish t o  develop a frame,If ,_ ln addition, we analyzed the definitions of -* move wewill f i n d  t h a t  they, in tu rn ,  represent instantiations of sti l lo3her frames,  which will be even more generalised than thosedeveloped for the uses o f  ftmoveft, The difference between theframes representing the def in i t ipns  of - move and those represent-46ing t h e  uses o f  "move" is t h a t  t h e  l a t t e r  are  the same as theformer w l t h  some s l o t s  f i l l e d .
Wi th in  t h e  bounds o f  t h e  a m b l ~ u -i t y  preselit in the  dictionary, this s t u t - f i l l i n g  will i d e n t l f ywhich definition of - move are employed in which u s e s  of umove".It seema C.0 me t h a t  this i r  nothing ,more than the process whichhas a l r e a d y  been described using a graph-theoretic naproach,except t h a t  the generalhxed frame f o r  each verb will not be,carzied along tnrough each s t ep .
Moreover, si.nce the semanticparslng sy-stem which has been desc r ibed  wi13 be based largelyon the  relationships derived f r o m  ?he definitions o f  preposi-tions,, , and these comprise most of the case r e l a t i o n s h i p s ,  thepars ing system w i l l  effectively circumscribe the ~ e r r n i s s i b l eelements (i. e. s l o t s )  which can be, presen t ,  glven any particu-lar.

Thus, a l though  the p h r a s e o l ~ y  ik different, thee f f e c t  is the same,If t h e r e  is ali e s s e n t i a l  equivalence between these t w o  ap-proaches, then.
s ince  frames p u r p o r t  t o  r e p r e s e n t  knowledge,the  process  descr ibed;  if s u c c e s s f u l ,  will r e s u l t  in an articu-l a t i o n  of whatever knswledge is contained in a dictionary, Whatt h i s  implles is tha t  the lexicon cofitains a g r e a t  d e a l  o f  know-ledge about  the world and not just information which will er+able us to understand such knowledge,Frames p rov ide  a 'great deal o f  ins lght  to t h e  approachwhich has been descr ibed he re ,  but the reverse a l s o  seems t oh o l d  true.
If the semantic content  of each d e f i h i t i o n  can becaptured ,  then it map be possible t o ~ a r t i c u l a t e  the  frame f o rany utterance by combinihg the  characteristics of the defini-t i o n $  of Y t s  constituent words within w h a t \ i s  permitted by thepars ing system.I 1, FINAL REMARKS5In S e c t i o n  1 ,  I descr ibed  some limitatzons o f  t h i s  paperand my research.
This paper suffers f rom a l a c k  of sufficientd e t a i l  to enabl,e a reader oP researcher to r e p l i c a t e  what Ihave done or t o  take the next  steps o f  cbmputerizing the  proce-dures whrch I have developed.
I will provide f u r t h e r  d e t a i l s  bnthe s p e c i f i c  steps I have fo l l owed  in reducing the s e t  of  verbsfrom 20,000 to 4,000 to anyone requesting.
With r e s p e c t  t o  com-pqter specifications, I have prepared some, but s topped  becauseI have no access t o  a computer, However, if any researcher 1si n t e r e s t e d  in pursuing t h i s  (or s e t t i n g  graduate students towork), I am prepared to develop the necessary specificationsand t o  work hand-in-hand for the f u r t h e r  advancement and re-finemekt of t h i s  methodology,I also ~ndicated in Section 1 t h a t  my research presentlyshows no f i n a l  res,z4lts and t h a t  I do no t  even know how muchf u r t h e r  effort-will be necessary t o  explicate tfi% parsing sys-tem which has been described.
Clearly, there  are great d m -tances y e t  to be covered toward  a goal of being capable oftransformin& ordinary  d i s c o u r s e  i n t o  a canohical form.
I believet h a t  characterization of the contents of an ordinary dictionary1s an e s s e n t i a l  s t e p  in a t t a in ing  t h i s  goal, and I am hopefu l 't h a t  my approash c&n be used t o  develop such a characterization.7 248If i t  seems w o r t h w h i l e  t o  pursue t h i s  approach, d e s p i t e  thel i m i t a t i o n s ,  I believe t h e  b e s t  way t o  do  s o  would be t o  estab-lish a single computer-based r e p o s i t o r y  f o r  a d i c t i o n a r y ,  p re f -erably W3, wi th  @h-l ine  access t o  resea rchers  a c r o s s  t h e  coun-t-...
