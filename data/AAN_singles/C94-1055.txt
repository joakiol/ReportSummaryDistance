This paper gives a brief outline of thesystem architecture and discusses ome re-cent developments in the project: the addi-.tion of actual event simulation in the KII,steps towards ;t document anthm'int,; tool,and a multilnodal user interface.1.

The need to provide sucha massive amount of multilingual material islikely to exceed both the c~q)acities of humantranslators as well as those of nmchine trails-lotion technology currently awdlable.
Ourwork in the TECII I)OC l)roject is motiwttedby the feeling that this situation calls f'()l"investigating a potential alternative: to cz-I, lOil ",at'ural language gcncralim~ tech'uologyin order to help overcome J~,e documentatio.nproblem.TE(~IlI)OC operates in the donlain oftcch'nical man'tzal.s, whMl was selected fortwo principal reasons.

The macro.~t'ructwrcof a manual  section is captured by schemassaying that  ( i f  apl)ropr iate ) one tirst talksabout the location of the object to be l'e-I)aired/maintained, then about i)ossil)le r(>l~lacement I)arts/sul)stances; next, the ;mtiv-ities are described, which fall into the threegeneral categories of checking seine attril)ute(('.f';., a lhlid lew!l), adding a substance andreplacing ~ l);U't/sulostauee.
These actionsare represented asphuls in the I.raditiona.1 A/sense, i.e.
with pre- and postconditions, andwith recursive structure (steps call be elab-orated through complete refinement plans).These representations are mapped onto alanguage-independent document representa-tion that also captures its microstructure bymeans of RST relations \[Mann and Thoml>son, 1987\] with a number of specilh: an-notations (e.g., a proposition is to be ex-pressed as an instruction, giving rise to inl-perative mood).
This document represen-tation is successively transformed into a se-quence of sentence plans (together with for-matting instructions in a selectahle targetformat; SGML, IgTEX , Zmacs and --- forscreen output - -  slightly formatted ASCIIare currently supported), which are handedover to sentence generators.
For English, weuse ~Penman' and its sentence planning hm-guage (SPL) as input terms, q'o l)roduceGerman and French text, we have imple-mented a German version of Pemnan's gram-mar (NIGEL), which is enhanced I)y a roofphology module, and a fragment of a Frenchgrammar in the same way.For a more detailled description of thesystem architecture see \[R6sner and Stede,1992b1.2 The Knowledge BaseThe Knowledge Base is encoded in I,OOM.In addition to the standard KL-ONE func-tionality (structured inheritance, separa-tion of terminological nd assertional knowl-edge), LOOM supl)orts object-oriente.d andalso rule-based programming.In addition to tile 'Upper Model' ofthe Penman generator (a basic ontologythat reflects semantic distinctions madeby language, \[Bateman, 19901) more.
than1000 concepts and instances constitute theTECHDOC KB.
They encode the techni-cal knowledge as well as the plan struc-tures that serve as input to the generationprocess.
The domains currently modeled areend consumer activities in car maintenanceand some technical procedures fl'om an air-craft maintenance l~ilanual.One of the central aims in the design phi-losophy of the TECt lDOC knowledge t)ase isthe separation of domain-independent tech-nical knowledge and specific concepts 1)er-raining to the particular domain: the I)orta-1)ility of general technical knowledge hasbeen a concern \['rom the beginning.
Forinstance, knowledge about various types oftanks (with or without imprinted scales, dip-sticks, drain bolts) is encoded on an abstractlevel in tile inheritance network (the 'mid-dle nlodel'), and the particular tanks foundin tile engine domain are attached at, thelower end.
Similarly, we have an abstractmodel of connect ions (plugs, bolts, etc.
),their properties, and the actions pertainingto them (phlg-in cormections can be merelyconnected or disconnected, screw connec-tions call be tightly or loosely connected, ordisconnected).
Objects with the function-ality of connections (e.g., spark phlgs) ap-pear at the bottom of the hierarchy.
Thus,when the system is transt\~rred to a dill'e.renttechnical domain - as experienced recentlywhen we moved to air(:raft manuals ---, largeparts of the abstract representation levels arere-usable.3 Document  Representa-tion Using RSTTile first task undertaken ill TECI IDOC wasa thorough analysis of a corpus of pages frommultilingual manuals in terms of eonte.nt aswell as structure of tile sections.
A text rep-resentation lew~l was sought that capturedthe conuno,mlities of the correponding sec-tions of the (lerman, English and Frenchtexts, i.e.
l, hal, was not tailored towards oneof the spe(:ific languages (for a discussiou ofrepresentation levels in multilingual gener-ation, see \[Grote et al, :1993\]).
RhetoricalStructure Theory (RST) turned out to 1)e ansefid formalism: for ahnost every section weinvestigated, the RST trees for the differentlanguage versions were identical.Our work with RST gave rise to a numberof new discourse relations that we found use-ful in analyzing our texts.
Also, we discov-ered several general problems with tile the-ory, regarding the status of minimal units\['or the analysis and the requirement that the340text representation bea tree structure all thetime (instead of a general graph).
These andother experiences with 1{ST are reported in\[E.gsner and Stede, 1992al.4 Recent Developments4.1 Event  s inmlat ion  in the knowl -edge baseWe developed a detailled represe.ntation fknowledge about actions.
Together withan action concept, preconditions a,M post.-conditions can be defined in a declarativeway.
The preconditions can I)e checkedagainst the current state of the knowledgebase (via BOOM's ASK queries).
If the In'e-conditions hold, the action can I)e performedand the postconditions are communicated tothe knowledge base (with the TEl,l, facil-ity of BOOM).
This typically leads to re-classification of certain technical objects in-volved.
With the help of BOOM's produc-tion rule mechanisnh additional actions ei-ther in the knowledge base or on all outputmedium (e.g., for visualization) can be trig-gered, lTn this mode, instru(:tion generationis at by-product of simulating the actions thatthe instructions pertain to.Being able to take the current stat.e ofa technical device into account, its in thissimulation mode, is a prerequisite for uI>coming interactiw', applications of instruc-tion generation: devices equil)ped with ade-quate sensory instruments produce raw dataI;hat can 1)e fed directly into tlw kuowle@:ebase.
Thereby, the specific situation of thedevice, e.g., the cltr, drives the instructiongeneration process, so that only the truly rel-evant information is given to the user.4.2 Towards  a document  author ingtoo lA lirst version of an authoring tool has beendesigned and implemented and tested with anumber of users.
The authoring tool allowsto interactively build up knowledge base in-stances of maintenance plans, including theactions and objects involved, and to convertthem immediately into documents in the se-letted languages.
At, any time, the tool takesthe current stal.e of tlle knowledge base intoaccount: all menus offering select:ons dy.-namically construct heir selection lists, st)that only ol)tions of applieid)le 1,yl)es ;,re of-fered.4.3 F rom text  generat ion  to a mul-t imoda l  in fo rmat ion  sys temThe generated t.exts are now displayed withwords, groups and phrases and whole sen-tences being mouse-sensitive and whenselected - ofl'ering menus with apl)licatflequeries to be directed {,o the underlyingknowledge base instances.

A rhetorical structure analysisdetermines logical relations between sentences basedon linguistic clues, such .as connectives, anaphoricexpressions, and idiomatic expressions ill the inputtext, and then recognizes an argumentative chunk ofsentences.Rhetorical structure extraction consists of sixmajor sub-processes:(1) Sentence  analysis accomplishes morphologicaland syntactic analysis for each sentence.
(2) Rhetor i ca l  re lat ion  ext rac t ion  detects rhetoricalrelations and constructs tile sequence of sen-tence identifiers and relations.
(3) Segmentat ion  detects rhetorical expressions be-tween distant sentences which define rhetoricalstrncture.
They are added onto tile sequenceproduced in step 2, and form restrictions forgenerating structures in step 4.
For example,expressions like " .
.
.3  reasons.
First, ... Sec-ond .
.
.
.
Th i rd , : .

,and  ".. .

are extracted and the structuralconstraint is added onto the sequence so ~s toform a chunk between the expressions.
(4) Cand idate  generat ion  generates all possiblerhetorical strnctures described by binary treeswhich do not violate segmentatio,, restrictions.
(5) P re ference  judgement  selects tile structure can-didate with the lowest penalty score, a wduedetermined based on l)reference rules on ev-ery two neighboring relations in tile ca,ldidate.This process elects tile structure candklate withthe lowest penalty score, a value determi,wdbased on preference rules on every two neigh-boring relations in the candkhtte.
A preferencerule used in this process represents a heuris-tic local preference on consecutive rhetoricalrelations between sentences.
Couskler the se-quence \[P <EG> t~ <SR> R\], where P, Q, R arearbitrary (blocks of) sentences.
The premiseof R is obvously not only t~ but both P aud O.Since the discussion in e and Q is considered toclose locally, structure \[\[p <E(;> Q\] <SR> R\]is preferableto \[P <EG> \[Q <SR> R\]\].
Penaltyscores are imposed on thc structure candidatesviolating the preference rules.
For example,for the text in Fig.
1, the structure candidateswhich contai,, tile substructure\[3 <EG> F\[4 <gx> 5\] <SR> 6\]\] , which sayssentence six is the entaihnent of sentence fourand five only, are penalized.
The authors haveinvestigated all pairs of rhetorical relations andderived those preference rules.The system analyzes inter-paragraph structuresafter the analysis ofiqtra-paragraph structures.
Whilethe system uses the rhetorical relations of the firstsentence of each paragraph for this analysis, it exe-cutes the same steps as il, does for tile intra -paragraphanalysis.5 ABSTRACT GENERATIONThe system generates the abstract of each section ofthe document by examining its rhetorical structure.
'\['he l)rocess consists of the following 2 stages.
(1) Sentence.
eva luat ion(2) S t ruc ture  reduct ionIn the sentence valuation stage, the system calcu-late the importance of each sentence in the originaltext based on the relative importance of rhetoricalrelations.
They are categorized into three types asshown in Table 2.
For tile relations categorized intoltightNueleus, the right node is more important, fromtile point of view of abstract generation, than tile leftnode.
In the c~se of the LeftNucleus relations, thesituatioq is vice versa.
And both nodes of the Both-Nucleus relations are equivalent in their importance.For example, since the right node of tile serial rela-tion (e.g., yotte (thus)) is the conclusion of the leftnode, the relation is categorized into RightN, cleus,and the right node is more iml)ortant han tile leftnode.The Actual sentence vahlation is carried outin a den~erlt marking way.
In order to determine im-portant text segments, the system imposes penaltieson both nodes for each rhetorical relation accordingto its relative i,nportance.
The system imposes apeualty oil the left node for tile RightNucleus rela-tlon, and also oil the right node for tlle LeftNuclevsrelation.
It adds penalties from tile root node to tileterminal nodes in turn, to calculate the penalties ofall nodes.Then, in the struelm'e ~vduction stage, tim sys-tem recursiw;ly cuts out the nodes, from tile terminalnodes, which are imposed the highest peualty.
Thelist of terminal nodes of tile final structure becomesan abstract for the original document.
Suppose thatthe abstract is longer than tile expected length.
