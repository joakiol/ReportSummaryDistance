In t roduct ionIn this paper we introduce a system For  thesemi-automat ic  enlargement of a morphological  lexicon.\]7t forms part of VIE-I,ANG, a Geru~an language dia loguesystem (Buchbetgor et al.
1982).

There exist several works on \]hi ssub~ect, e.g.
Bergmann (1982), Knopik (1984), Schott(\]978), Schu\]ze and Heinze (1982), WJ\] lee (1979).
ForVIE-LANG we developed our own c lass i f icat ion scheme(T~ost and Doff \ ]nor 1986), based on Kunze and Ruediger(1968).For all those schemeR Jt takes an expert to classifynew words correctly.
Our acquis i t ion system contains\ ] \ ]ngulst ic expert ise in the fornl of d i f ferent typos ofrules, which al lows for semi-automat ic  acquis(t Jon of\]exica\] knowledge in an interact ion with a user whoneed not have spec\] f J c i ingu\] st i c knowledge.Whereas di f ferent approaches for knowledge acquis i t ionfor N\],U systems have been proposed (e.g.

Knowledge BaseThe acquisition system is rule based.
Its knowledgebase comprises three types of rules:- Rules representing inflectional paradigms.
Theserules describe the basic types of conjugation anddeclination in German.- Morphonological rules.
The basic inflectionalendings are split up into a much larger set byvarious morphonological rules which alter the endingsand stems to make pronunciation easier.- Heuristic rules.
While the former two rule types arederived from the German grammar proper, these rulesare like plausible guesses.
They guide the system tomake choices like which category a word belongs toaccording to knowledge about forms (i.e.
all verbsend with -en), actual frequency of classes, etc.These rules are organized in distinct packages.
Onlyrules in active packages are considered.
Rules mayactivate and deactivate rule packages.4.
Overall ArchitectureAccording to their different nature, the threementioned types of rules are processed differently.Knowledge about inflectional types serves to partitionthe words into disjunct classes.
Once the inflectionaltype has been determined, there are relatively clearguidelines as to the inflection of the word.
Theinflectional type actually is a subclassification ofthe word type.One of the crucial points is determining the word type.The system first tries to make use of its basicvocabulary.
It checks whether a new word is composedof words already in the lexicon or of an existing wordstem together with a derivational ending.
There is arule in German morphology stating that in compoundwords the morphological class is determined by the lastword.
On a similar line reasoning about derivationalendings is performed, as those may determine word typeas well as inflection.
As a next heuristicmorphological clues are taken into consideration.There exist a number of them, but ambiguities mayarise.
If this is the case, a third strategy isapplied: the system asks the user to type in a shortutterance containing the new word.
The utterance isanalysed by the parser of VIE-LANG renderinginformation about the word type by means of the phrasetype it appears in.
In applying this method, thesystem relies on a simple but important presupposition:the user usually enters an utterance containing theword in a proper linguistic context facilitatingdetermination of its type.
We do not argue that theuser will always utter the minimal projection, but thathe will not violate phrase borders with his utterance.The knowledge about phrase types as well as the basicvocabulary permits unambiguous determination of theword type in most cases, especially as the mostirregular forms that are very limited in number (wordsof the closed word classes: pronouns, articles,auxiliary and modal verbs, etc.)
have already beenincluded in the basic lexicon.Once the word type has been determined, the rulepackage associated with it is activated.
Let's supposethe new word is a verb.
Then, the verb-package istriggered.
Here in turn we find packages for strongand weak inflection.
The large number of subclasses isimplied by morphonological reasons, whereby the smallnumber of general paradigms is multiplied.Morphonologic rules have exact matching conditions,therefore classification in this part is automated to a388large extent.
The on\].y problem is deciding for weak orstrong inflection first.
As exact rules do not exist,heuristics are applied which are based mainly on wordfrequency.An important feature is the dynamic interactionregister: the hypotheses evoked by the heuristic rulesrequire to be confirmed by the user.
The system knowswhich word forms will form sufficient evidence for acertain hypothesis.
It will generate these forms andask the user for confirmation.
The forms howeverdepend on the hypotheses.
Thus, the user is only askeda minimum of questions.
The forms to be asked for arekept in a dynamic interaction register which is updatedwith every hypothesis and every answer from the user.5.
An  Example  Sess ionIn this chapter we show how a new entry is actuallycreated.
The user starts the interaction by entering anew word, e.g.
'abgeben' (to leave).
The first thingthe system has to do is to decide about the wordcategory.
To find out if it is a compound word it willtry to split off words first from the beginning thenfrom the end.This will result in recognizing 'ab' as a separableverbadjunct.
Of course the 'ab '  could be part of atotally different stem like 'Abend' (evening) or 'abet'(but).
So the system looks for facts supporting theverb hypothesis.
Verbs are usually typed in ininfinitive form and this implies the ending '-en' (in afew cases also '-n').
Of course this '-en' could alsobe part of a stem like 'Magen' (stomach) or 'wegen'(because), but the combination of both verb adjunct'ab' and ending '-en' on a word belonging to adifferent category is highly unp\]ausible.
So 'abgeben'is split into ab/geb/en.As a next step the lexicon is looked up for 'geb'.
Ifit is found the rest is easy.
All the information from'geb' is simply duplicated; the only additionalinformation to be stored is about the separable 'ab'.This way the new entry may be created without any otherhelp by the user.To continue with our example we will assume that 'geb'is not already contained in the lexicon.
That meansthe system has to figure out a hypothesis concerningthe conjugation type of 'abgeben' (either weak orstrong).
Since weak verbs make up the vast majority ofGerman verbs, this hypothesis is tried first.FORM CLASS FM UM PF SYpresent tense abgeb 44 0 0 I 502Weak conjugation is regular, all forms are built fromone stem.
To confirm weak conjugation it suffices toshow the user the Ist person sg past tense.
Beforedoing so all morphonological rules connected to weakconjugation are tried.
None applies, so userinteraction can start.
Ist person sg of past tense inthe weak paradigm is 'gebte ab'.
To make sure the userknows which form is intended, some context has to beprovided.
This leads to the phrase 'gestern gebte ichab' (I leaved yesterday) specifying tense and person.The user recognizes 'gebte' as incorrect and rejectsthat phrase.
This makes the system discard thehypothesis weak and try strong instead.Strong conjugation is more complicated than weak.There may be a maximum of four different stems forpresent tense, present tense 2nd and 3rd person sg,past tense and PPP.
All these poss ib i l i t ies  haveeither to be resolved automatical ly  or asked expl ic i t lyfrom the user.
First the system continues to determinethe past tense forms.
There are three di f ferent typesof vowel changes in the case of 'e'-stems (e-a-e,e-o-o, e-a-o).
They are sorted by frequency, becauseno other cr i ter ion is avai lable.
Again allmorphonological  rules appl icab\]e to strong verbs aretried.
In our case none applies, so the user is askedagain for ver i f icat ion with 'gestern gab ich ab' (Ileft yesterday).FORM CLASSpresent tense abgeb 30pres.
t .2nd p.sgpast tense abgab 23past part ic ip leFM UM PF SYThis t ime the user confirms, so the system can go on.There are two possib i l i t ies  for the PPP, and again themore frequent one is tried, and accepted by the user.There is sti l l  another i rregular i ty concerning 2nd and3rd person sg present tense, in most of the cases thestem vowel 'e' becomes 'i'.
After ver i f icat ion of thisfact the morphological  class is f inally determined.The system creates three lexical entries 'abgeb','abgib' and 'abgab' for present and PPP, 2nd and 3rdperson sg present tense and past tense respectively.Now all of the features have to be fi l led in.
PF of'abgeb' is set to I, since the verbadjunct  'ab' impliesthe use of the pref ix 'ge-' for the PPP.
UM is set to8 for 'abgab', indicating 'umlautung' for thesubjunct ive mode in the Dast tense.
FM of th~ pr imaryentry 'abgeb' is set to 8 as a resu\]t of thecombinat ion of classes.
Then SY is set to 502 (5 =verb, 0 = present perfect with 'haben', 2 : separableverbadjunct  of length 2).FORM CLASS FM UM PF SYpresent tense abgeb 22 8 0 I 502pres.t .2nd p.sg abgib 26 0 0past tense abgab 23 8 0Next all indicat ive forms of present and past tense andthe PPP are pr inted and the user is asked forconfirmation.
This step could actual ly  be skipped butit is another safety measure against faulty entries.In our specif ic  example there is a final step to bedone: Since 'geb' was not found in the lexicon, it hasto be included, too, for two reasons.
First theanalysis a lgor i thm otherwise could not handle all thosecases where the part ic le is actual ly split off in thetext, second there may be more compound verbs with'geb', and their incorporation into the lexicon canthen be handled fully automatic.
Since the verb stemof a compound verb with separable verbadjunct  canalways appear as a verb in its own right, this poses noproblem.
The situat ion is s l ightly more di f f icult  withother part ic les where this is not granted.
In thosecases the new entry must be marked as internal, so thatit does not affect analysis or synthesis.Creat ion of the new entries is simple anyway.
Allforms are dupl icated, 'abgeb', 'abgib' and 'abgab' arechanged to 'geb', 'gib', 'gab' respect ively and SY isset to 500 instead of 502.6.
Conclus ionWe have presented a sysLem which automates acquis i t ionof lexical data for a natural language understandingsystem to a large extent.
Knowledge acquis i t ion takesplace in graceful  interaction with a human who is notsupposed to have specif ic l inguist ic knowledge.
Thesystem relies on the exist ing natural language systemVIE-LANG containing among other sources of knowledge alexicon with a basic vocabulary such that acquis i t iondoes not start from scratch but can be seen as aniterative process.
The acquis i t ion system is based ona small rule based system in which three dif ferentsorts of knowledge - inflections\],  morphonological  andheurist ic are d ist inguished and processeddif ferently.
As for der\ [vat ional  endings as well ascompound words the system heavi ly relies on exist inglexicon entr ies to form its hypotheses.The descr ibed system forms part of an integrated systemfor the acquis i t ion of di f ferent sorts of knowledge fornatural language understanding.
An outl ine of theoveral l  system is to be found in Trost and Buchberger(\]985).
The final goal wil l  be a system which augmentsits knowledge automatical ly  in every interaction withthe user in a pract ical  and comfortable way.AcknowledgmentsPart of this work was sponsored by the Austr ian 'Fondszur Foerderung der wissenschaft \ ] ichen Forschung', grantno.5468.REFERENCES:Ba\] lard B.W.
