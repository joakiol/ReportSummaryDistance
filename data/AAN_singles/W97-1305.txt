Resolving Anaphoric References onDeficient Syntactic DescriptionsRoland StuckardtIm Mellsig 25D-60433 Frankfurt am Main, Germanys tuckardt@compuserve ,  tomAbstractSyntactic coindexing restrictions are bynow known to be of central importanceto practical anaphor resolution approaches.Since, in particular due to structural am-biguity, the assumption of the availabilityof a unique syntactic reading proves to beunrealistic, robust anaphor resolution relieson techniques to overcome this deficiency.In this paper, two approaches are presentedwhich generalize the verification of coin-dexing constraints odeficient descriptions.At first, a partly heuristic method is de-scribed, which has been implemented.
Sec-ondly, a provable complete method is spec-ified.
It provides the means to exploitthe results of anaphor esolution for a fur-ther structural disambiguation.
By render-ing possible a parallel processing model,this method exhibits, in a general sense,a higher degree of robustness.
As a prac-tically optimal solution, a combination ofthe two approaches is suggested.1 In t roduct ionThe interpretation f anaphoric expressions is knownto be a difficult problem.
In principle, a variety ofconstraints and preference heuristics, including fac-tors which rely on semantic, pragmatic, and worldknowledge, contribute to this task (Carbonell andBrown, 1988).
Operational approaches to anaphorresolution on unrestricted iscourse, however, areconfined to strategies exploiting lobally availableevidence like morphosyntactic, syntactic, and sur-face information.Among the most promising practical work are ap-proaches relying on the availability of syntactic sur-face structure by employing coindexing restrictions,salience criteria, and parallelism heuristics (Lappinand Leass, 1994; Stuckardt, 1996b).
However, eventhe assumption ofthe availability of a unique syntac-tic description is unrealistic since, in general, parsinginvolves the solution of difficult problems like attach-ment ambiguities, role uncertainty, and the instan-tiation of empty categories.
Based on this observa-tion, Kennedy and Boguraev suggest an adaptationof the Lappin and Leass approach to the analysisfrontend of English Constraint Grammar (Karlssonet al, 1995), which provides a part-of-speech tag-ging comprising an assignment ofsyntactic functionbut no const i tuent  s t ruc ture .
This information de-ficiency is partially overcome by the application ofa regular filter which heuristically reconstructs con-stituent structure (Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996).The approach of Kennedy and Boguraev resorts toshallow input and heuristic reconstruction f surfacestructure in general, thus leaving open the questionwhat may be gained by relying on the possibly par-tial, but potentially more reliable output of a con-ventional parser.
This question is dealt with in thepresent paper.
An operational pproach to anaphorresolution isadvocated which achieves robustness bya generalization to deficient syntactic descriptionsrather than by resorting to shallow input.
In sec-tion 2, notions of robustness are defined accordingto which different methods may be classified.
Sec-tion 3 develops the perspective of fragmentary s n-tax and identifies the coindexing restrictions ofbind-ing theory as an important anaphor resolution strat-egy which is in particular affected by this loss ofconfigurational evidence.
In section 4, a solutionis presented which accomplishes robustness againstsyntactic deficiency by a partly heuristic verificationof coindexing constraints on fragmentary s ntax.
Fi-nally, in section 5, a non-heuristic algorithm is spec-ified which works on the standardized representa-tion of ambiguous syntactic description by packed,shared parse forests.
It achieves a higher degree ofrobustness by making available referential evidence30for a further disambiguation f syntactic structure.A combination ofthe two approaches is suggested asthe practically optimal solution.2 Not ions  o f  Robustness2.1 Robustness in Natural LanguageProcessingIn natural anguage processing in general, the ro-bustness issue comprises the ability of a softwaresystem to cope with input that gives rise to deficientdescriptions at some descriptional layerJ More orless implicit is the assumption that the system ex-hibits some kind of monotonic behaviour: the lessdeficient he description, the higher the quality ofthe output (Menzel, 1995).Following Menzel further, this intuitive character-ization may be refined.
Processing should exhibitautonomy in the sense that complete failures at onestage of analysis hould not cause complete failuresat other stages of analysis or even a failure of theoverall processing.
Moreover, the processing modelshould ideally employ some kind of interaction be-tween different stages of analysis: deficiency at onestage of analysis hould be compensated by the in-formation gained at other stages.2.2 Robustness and Anaphor Resolut ionIn the light of the above description, the robustnessrequirement for the anaphor resolution task may berendered more precisely.
In the aforesaid operationalapproaches, a sequential processing model is followedaccording to which anaphor esolution is performedby referring to the result of an already completed syn-tactic analysis.
This architecture, however, tacitlyignores evidence for structural disambiguation thatmay be contributed by strong expectations at thereferential layer (Stuckardt, 1996a).
In terms of thegeneral goals of robust processing, this means that,since there is no interaction, the robustness require-ment merely shows up in form of the monotonic-ity and autonomy demands: the anaphor esolutionmodule has to cope with deficient or shallow syntac-tic information.
Besides the trivial way to achievethis kind of robustness by simply not exploiting defi-cient syntactic descriptions, the following two mod-els may be followed:?
the shallow description model: by exploit-ing heuristic rules to reconstruct syntactic de-scription, the anaphor esolution strategies are1The deficiency may result either because the inputitself is deficient, or due to shortcomings ofthe process-ing resources, e.g.
lexicon, grammar/parser, o  seman-tic/pragmatic disambiguation.adapted to shallow input data which are neverdefective.
2?
the deficient description model: by extendinganaphor resolution strategies to work on a pos-sibly ambiguous or incomplete description, syn-tactic evidence is exploited as far as available.In contrast o the approach of Kennedy and Bogu-raev, which is based on the shallow descriptionmodel, the subsequent sections develop two methodsthat follow the deficient description model.
At first,a new partly heuristic approach will be described.Secondly, a non-heuristic algorithm will be specifiedwhich establishes the conceptually superior degreeof robustness through interaction: it makes avail-able the results of anaphor esolution for syntacticdisambiguation.3 F ragmentary  Syntax3.1 PhenomenaThe main phenomena which give rise to structuralambiguity of syntactic descriptions are uncertaintyof syntactic function (involving subject and directobject) and attachment ambiguities of prepositionalphrases, relative clauses, and adverbial clauses.
Inthe examplePeter observes the owner of the telescope with it.depending on the availability of disambiguating in-formation, it may be uncertain whether the under-lined prepositional phrase with it should be inter-preted adverbially or attributively.
From the con-figurational perspective, these ambiguities give riseto fragmentary syntactic descriptions which consistof several tree-shaped connected components.
Withthe exception of the topmost tree fragment, all com-ponents correspond to a syntagma of type PP, S, orNP whose attachment or role assignment failed.In addition, cases in which no reading exists giverise to fragmentary s ntactic descriptions compris-ing the constituents whose combination failed due toconstraint violation.3.2 Fragmentary Syntax and AnaphorResolutionAmong the anaphor resolution strategies potentiallyaffected by fragmentary s ntax are heuristics as wellas constraints.
Preference criteria like salience fac-tors and syntactic parallelism are not affected by2Here, the monotonicity demand of intuitive robust-ness virtually vanishes, ince there is no longer a syntac-tic input prone to deficiency.31all types of syntactic defects.
Moreover, there isa plethora of heuristics which do not rely on syn-tactic function or structure.
Structural coindexingconstraints, however, may lose evidence in all abovecases of fragmentary syntax.
Since they are knownto be of central importance to the antecedent fil-tering phase of operational anaphor esolution ap-proaches, the subsequent discussion focuses on theimpact of deficient surface structure description tothis class of restrictions.According to the Government and Binding Theoryof Chomsky, the core of the syntactic oindexing re-strictions is stated as followsDef in i t ion  1 (b ind ing pr inc ip les)(A ) A reflexive or reciprocal is bound in its bindingcategory.
(B) A pronominal is free (i.e.
not bound) in itsbinding category.
(C) A referring expression is free in any domain.where binding category denotes the next domina-tor containing some kind of subject (Chomsky,1981), and binding is defined as coindexed and c-commanding:Def in i t ion 2 ( thec -command re lat ion)Surface structure node X c-commands node Y if andonly if the next "branching node" which dominatesX also dominates Y and neither X dominates Y, Ydominates X nor X = Y.A further structural well-formedness condition, com-monly named i-within-i filter, rules out "refer-entially circular" coindexings, i.e.
configurationsmatching the pattern \[c~ .. .
Ill .
.
.
\]i\]i.In the above example, the latter restriction comesto an application, licensing a coindexing of telescopeand it only if the PP containing it is not interpretedas an attribute to telescope - otherwise, in contradic-tion to the i-within-i condition, the pronoun wouldbe contained in the NP of the tentative antecedent.Hence, if the PP attachment ambiguity has not beenresolved prior to anaphor resolution, the fragmen-tary syntactic description does not contribute theconfigurational evidence which is necessary for defi-nitely confirming antecedent candidate telescope.4 Check ing  B ind ing  Const ra in ts  onF ragmentary  Syntax4.1 Basic Observat ionsThe first step towards the verification of binding con-straints on fragmentary syntax is suggested by thefollowing observation:I f  the anaphor as well as the antecedentcandidate are contained in the same con-nected component of the fragmentary syn-tactic description, no (direct) binding the-oretic evidence is lost.In this case, the verification of the binding restric-tions of anaphor and antecedent will be possible ina non-heuristic manner, since the necessary positive(---~ binding principle A) and negative (-+ bindingprinciples B, C) syntactic-configurational evidence isentirely available.
3 If, however, the two occurrencesbelong to different fragments, relevant informationmay be lost.These considerations give rise to a first solution: tobe able to detect which one of the two cases holds,the descriptions of the discourse referent occurrencesare supplemented with an attribute which uniquelyidentifies of the syntactic fragment to which the cor-responding NP 4 belongs (e.g.
a pointer to the rootof the fragment, or a natural number).
For a givenpair of anaphor a and antecedent candidate 7, thefollowing procedure is applied:I f  anaphor c~ and candidate ~ occur in thesame fragment, verify binding restrictionsas in case of unique syntactic description.If  they occur in different fragments, con-sider ,~ a configurationally acceptable can-didate for a, but reduce the plausibilityscore associated with the pair (o~,~/).Consequently, in certain, recognizable cases, the ro-bust binding constraint verification merely yields aheuristic approval of coindexing.
The strategy losesa part of its former strictness because configurationalevidence is only partially available.4.2 Ru le  Pat ternsEven in the disadvantageous case, a closer look atthe tree fragments of anaphor and antecedent can-didate may reveal additional information.
Figure 1shows rule patterns which exploit this evidence, s3This statement, however, solely applies to the di-rect comparison of the involved occurrences, ince incase of further, transitive coindexings, negative videncestemming from decision interdependency ( f. (Stuckardt,1996a)) may get lost.4This slightly sloppy assumption of a bijection be-tween NP nodes of syntactic structure and discourse ref-erent occurrences does not affect he validity of the sub-sequent discussion.5The following notational conventions are used:round brackets delimit constituents; quare brackets em-phasize fragment boundaries; be(X) denotes the bind-ing category of surface structure node X; bn(X) denotes32~\[F1\] ~/{ .

In particular, this im-plies that the fragments may not be attached ina way that one occurrence locally c-commands theother.
Therefore, in both cases, binding principle Bis respected, and the coindexing of a and '7 is non-heuristically approved.Conversely, if pattern \[F2\] is matched, "7 is defini-tively ruled out as the local antecedent prescribedfor type A anaphor a: it is impossible to connect hetwo fragments in a way that "7 locally c-commandsa.
Here, the fragment of the candidate is only re-quired to contain the branching node of "7, becausethis suffices to preclude that "7 c-commands a if Fiis embedded in Fj.For certain successive fragment pairs, the parsing re-sult comprises additional information about immedi-ate or transitive mbedding.
Based on this evidence,further non-heuristic rules (\[FEi\],\[FE2\], \[FE3\], and\[FE4\]) become applicable (Fd = dominating frag-ment, F?
= embedded fragment).This list may be supplemented by rules which arebased on more subtle configurational case distinc-tions, and, moreover, by heuristic rules which em-ploy standardized assumptions about typical deci-sion patterns of structural disambiguation.
Witheach of the latter rules, an individual decision plau-sibility weight may be associated.In an application context, the extension of heuristicrules should be limited to configurations which areknown to be of practical relevance.
Based on a suit-able corpus annotated with syntactic and referentialinformation, it should be possible to determine prob-the branching node dominating X according to the c-command efinition; the subscript of Xtypev denotesthat the binding theoretic lass of the occurrence con-tributed by X is Y E {A, B, C}, e.g.
P, yp~ s is a pronom-inal.
x//* indicates that a rule pattern admits/forbidscoindexing.abilities for different coindexing configurations by astatistical distribution analysis.
These probabilitiesmay then be used to derive promising plausibilityweighted rules.4.3 An  exampleThe following example illustrates the application ofsome of the above rules: 6Der Mann hat den Pr~sidenten besucht,der ihn yon sich iiberzeugte.
"The man has the president visited,who him from himself convinced.
"Because of the intervening past participle, the rel-ative clause may be interpreted as an attribute toeither Mann or Prdsidenten.
Hence, syntactic ambi-guity arises, yielding a surface structure descriptionwhich consists of the following two fragments(S Mann(VP President))(S der(VP ihn(VP (PP sich))))In addition, it is known that the second fragment isembedded in the first.
There are three pronominalanaphors to be resolved: the reflexive pronoun sichof type A, the nonreflexive pronoun ihn of type B,and the relative pronoun der of type B.For the reflexive pronoun sieh, the syntactic restric-tions may be applied nonheuristically.
Candidatesder and ihn are contained in the same surface struc-ture fragment.
Consequently, binding theoretic evi-dence is completely available.
Since the candidateslocally c-command sich, they are both determined tobe possible antecedents.
The two candidates Mannand Prdsident, however, occur in the other fragment.Hence, it is attempted to apply one of the above rule6The example is given in German, because the struc-tural ambiguity comes out more strikingly.33patterns.
Since the reflexive pronoun is of bindingtheoretic type A, and the fragment in which it occurscontains its binding category (the S node of the rel-ative clause), the Fe fragment pattern of rule \[FE2\]is matched; analogously, the (dominating) fragmentcontaining the type C candidates matches the Fdfragment pattern.
Hence, rule \[FE2\] applies: it non-heuristically rules out Mann as well as Priisident.Similarly, for the pronouns ihn and der, type C can-didates Mann and Pr~isident are definitively con-firmed.
Since these anaphors are of type B, the Fefragment pattern of rule \[FEll is matched.
More-over, the (dominating) antecedent candidate frag-ment matches pattern Fd.
Consequently, \[FE1\] ap-plies and predicts the admissibility of the candidates.4.4 An  Implementat ionThe above technique for achieving robustness ac-cording to the deficient description model has beenintegrated into an anaphor resolution system forGerman text (Stuckardt, 1996b).
7 At present, onlynonheuristic rules are employed.In a quantitative evaluation on a corpus of architectbiographies (Lampugnani, 1983), the algorithm cor-rectly resolved about 82 per cent of type B pronouns(including possessives).
In an idealized test scenarioin which correct syntactic readings were manuallyprovided, a precision of 90 per cent was obtained.Hence, on fragmentary syntax, the result qualityonly decreases by 8 points of percentage.
Comparedwith the 75 per cent achieved by the shallow de-scription approach of Kennedy and Boguraev, thisindicates that approaches to robust anaphor reso-lution which follow the deficient description modelmay achieve a higher precision.
A principled, in-structive comparison based on a broader set of textgenres has to confirm this improvement.5 A Complete AlgorithmBy the nonheuristic rules of the above method, onlythose parts of surface structure description are ex-ploited which are valid independently of further dis-ambiguation.
It is, however, possible to follow amore principled approach which utilizes configura-tional evidence that is confined to certain readings.As it will be shown in the following, this may beachieved by tracing the reading dependency of an-tecedent decisions relying on particular configura-tions.
Through this technique, the results of refer-ential disambiguation can be utilized as evidence forfurther narrowing structural ambiguity.Tin its principal ayout, the algorithm coincides withthe one that will be described in section 5.3.5.1 Dominance  Relat ions in Packed SharedForestsFollowing a standardized framework, ambiguousparsing results are henceforth assumed to be rep-resented as packed shared forests (PSFs) (Tomita,1985).
In this representation, structural ambiguityis encoded by packing different derivation variantsof input substrings into single interior nodes.
More-over, subtrees common to different readings are al-lowed to be shared.
Formally, such a parse forest canbe described as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) witha distinguished topmost element, and leaves corre-sponding to input words.Given a PSF T with nodes V = {vl,...,Vk}, letP (v l ) , .
.
.
, P (Vk)  be the respective derivation vari-ants according to packing.
Hence,kn := \[ I  IP(vi) li----1denotes the maximum number of readings (parsetrees) represented by T. Consequently, sets of read-ings may be specified by bit vectors of length n.The application of binding principles crucially restson the availability of information about dominancerelations between parse tree nodes.
In ambigu-ous structure, configurational relations may be con-fined to certain subsets of readings.
The idea nowis to qualify dominance information by bit vectorsof length n. For each pair (vi,vo) consisting ofan interior node vi and an occurrence contribut-ing node vo (usually preterminal), vectors ad(vi, vo)and l~l(vi, Vo) are introduced.
Vectors ad(vi, Vo) andld(vi,Vo) characterize the readings in which vi arbi-trarily dominates, or (in the sense of binding theory)locally dominates Vo.
Based on these vectors, it willbe possible to apply the binding restrictions in areading sensitive way.By generalizing a technique for unambiguous syn-tax (Correa, 1988), the reading-qualified dominanceinformation may be precomputed as follows, s Thetree traversal process tarts at the preterminal nodeswhich are assumed to be shared among all readings.
(If this condition is not satisfied, a preprocessingis performed which, by topdown propagation, de-termines reading characterization vectors which arethen taken for a qualified initialization of the vectorsl~/and ad.)
Each preterminal node Vp is assigned thefollowing vectors:{ (1,...,1), vp ; Vo Jd(v,,,Vo) = l?
(vp,Vo) := (0, ,0), vpSAlternatively, this information may be determinedon demand of the anaphor esolution task.34pa'd(vi,Vo) :=ld(vi ,vo) :=V m) A ( V dd(vd, Vo)))l<rn<lP(vi)l Vde D(P(vl),m)V (tT(P(vi), m) A ( V ld(vd,Vo))), if ~beateg(vi)l_<ra~lP(vl)l Va C D(P(vl),m)(0,...,0), if bcateg(vi)Figure 2: bottom-up computation ofdominance vectorsThe computation proceeds bottom-up as follows.Let vi be an interior node for which all descendantsof all derivation variants in P(vi) have already beenprocessed.
By taking into consideration whether thenode delimits a local domain of binding, the vectorsare assigned as shown in figure 2 (the operators Aand V denote bitwise conjunction and disjunction ofvectors, respectively).The computation of the vectors t~d(vi,vo), whichcharacterize the readings in which vi arbitrarilydominates vo, denotes the basic case.
The outer-most vector disjunction sums over the derivationvariants P(vi) which, due to packing, exist for theinterior node vi.
Bit vector lY(P(vi), m) acts as afilter characterizing the subset of readings in whichthe m th derivation variant of vi, 1 < m < IP(vi)l,is valid?
For each derivation variant, there exists aset D(P(vi), m) of descendants Vdwhich correspondto nonterminals on the right-hand side of the respec-tive rewriting rule.
The nodes that are dominatedby these nonterminals are transitively dominated byvi.
Hence, the overall result is obtained by recur-sively summing up the individual contributions ofthe descendants and qualifying them by conjoiningthem with p'~P(vi), m).Vectors l~l(vi, vo), which characterize the readings inwhich vi locally dominates Vo, are computed simi-larly.
The only difference arises if vi delimits a localdomain of binding.
In this case, the dominance re-lation computation starts from scratch, i.e.
with thezero vector.5.2 Binding Principle Verification onPacked Shared ForestsThe vectors ad(vi,vo) and ld(vi,Vo) are used toperform referential disambiguation which is sensi-tive to structural ambiguity.
For this purpose, dur-ing anaphor esolution, each pair of anaphor a andantecedent candidate '7 (identified with the corre-sponding preterminal nodes) is assigned a vectorg(a,,7) characterizing the readings under which a9Upon fixation of a particular encoding scheme forreading characterization, vectors lY(P(vi),m) may becomputed according to a simple formula.coindexing of a and '7 is configurationally admis-sible.
By taking into account the respective bindingprinciples, F(a, '7) may be determined as follows::= ( VvEbn(~)A(  VvEbn(o~)( lY(P(v),rn) A bl~s(v,a)))( tY(P(v),m) A bI~w(v,'7)))where bn(x) represents the set of dominators of anode x which are branching nodes for x in the senseof the c-command efinition.
The first conjunctspecifies the bitvector characterizing the subset ofreadings under which the binding principle of theanaphor a is (constructively) satisfied.
Analogously,the second conjunct describes the (unconstructive)binding principle verification for the antecedent can-didate 7.
In both cases, branching nodes v have tobe considered because they determine the startingpoint for the application of the dominance informa-tion.
Since the property of being a branching noderelatively to another node may in general depend onpacking variants, reading dependency arises.
Again,this subtlety is modeled by adding up a set of dis-juncts which are qualified by vectors p"~P(v),m),v E bn(x).
Here, these vectors characterize thesubset of readings in which the property of beinga branching node relatively to node x holds for v.The strong (constructive) and weak (unconstructive)verification of binding princi~es is accompl~hed bya conjunction with vectors bps(v, a) and bpw(v,'7),respectively, which, depending on the applicablebinding principle, exploit he reading-qualified dom-ination information:b s(vl,v ) := {The sole difference betweenl~l(vl, v2), if bttype(v2) = A/d(Vl, v2), if bttype(v2) -- Ba~d(vl, v2), if bttype(v2) = C(1,. .

Finally, in step 3, antecedent selectiontakes place.
Only decisions are combined which donot interdepend.
The reading compatibility is veri-fied by the stepwise computation of vector ~.11A theoretical analysis hows that, under the assump-tion of a clever organization of the computation,the number of bitvector conjunctions and disjunc-tions (including dominance vector determination) isbounded by O(bq 2 + s), where q is the number of oc-currence contributing NPs, s denotes the size of thePSF, and b stands for the maximal degree of branch-ing due to packing and sharing.
For natural lan-guage grammars, it is justified to assume that b is a(small) constant.
12 The complexity of sorting in step2 is O(q 2 log(q)).
Hence, the overall time complexityof the approach amounts to O(q2(n + log(q)) + s).The practical contribution of n, however, is reduced:in a reasonable implementation, the conjunction ordisjunction of w bits (w = processor word length)Z?The optimal choice of preference factors and weightsremains to be investigated; at least some of the crite-ria which have been investigated by (Lappin and Leass,1994) do not immediately generalize to deficient syntax.lZIn some cases, it may be necessary to retract de-cisions.
Hence, step 3 has to be supplemented with abacktracking facility.12In the general case, however, b may be O(\[V\[).36will be performed by an elementary operation.5.4 Structural  Disambiguation byReferential EvidenceSince vectors r~ describing the reading dependencyare available, any set of anaphor esolution choicesmay now be referred to as further evidence for struc-tural disambiguation.
PSF trees which are from nowon invalid can be eliminated by pruning all packingvariants whose characterizing vectors are orthogonalto ~.
By this means, based on the above describedframework, it becomes possible to realize a paral-lel processing model which accomplishes the refinedversion of robustness by interaction.6 Conc lus ionTwo approaches to robust anaphor esolution havebeen presented.
The first one, which has been imple-mented, works on fragments of parses representingsubtrees which, due to ambiguity or constraint vio-lation, have not been conjoined.
The second one hasbeen formally specified.
It exploits tructural infor-mation as far as possible by taking into account dom-inance relations that are confined to certain read-ings.
Moreover, by producing an exact description ofthe reading dependency of its decisions, anaphor res-olution according to the latter model yields furtherevidence for structural disambiguation, thereby ren-dering possible a higher degree of robust processingby allowing structural and referential disambigua-tion to interact.An implementation f the theoretically described ap-proach has to show whether its practical behaviour,which depends on the maximum number of PSFreadings n determining the length of the bitvectors,is acceptable.
A further generalization is neededfor the processing of (truely) fragmentary PSFs incase there is no reading at all.
A practically fea-sible solution might be obtained by combining thetwo approaches: the theoretically complete methodis applied to cope with ambiguity that is clearly con-fined to certain "local" fragments (e.g.
PP attach-ment within clausal fragments), thereby keeping nsmall.
The heuristic approach andles the remain-ing cases (e.g.
unattached clausal fragments).
Whilea systematic nvestigation and evaluation of the lat-ter issue is pending, the first results for the prac-tical method confirm that, in accordance with psy-cholinguistic evidence, high-quality anaphor esolu-tion does not hinge on the availability of a uniquesyntactic description.Re ferencesJaime G.
