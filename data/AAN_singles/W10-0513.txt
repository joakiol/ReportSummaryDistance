We believe that thisdata will prove valuable to researchers workingin social media, natural language processing,large-scale data processing, and similar areas.1 IntroductionIn the recent years, the microblogging service Twit-ter has become a popular tool for expressing opin-ions, broadcasting news, and simply communicatingwith friends.
People often comment on events inreal time, with several hundred micro-blogs (tweets)posted each second for significant events.
Despitethis popularity, there still does not exist a publiclyavailable corpus of Twitter posts.
In this paper wedescribe the first such corpus collected over a periodof two months using the Twitter streaming API.1Our corpus contains 97 million tweets, and takes up14 GB of disk space uncompressed.
The corpus isdistributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license2 and can be ob-tained at http://demeter.inf.ed.ac.uk/.
Eachtweet has the following information:?
timestamp ?
time (in GMT) when the tweet waswritten?
anonymized username ?
the author of the tweet,where the author?s original Twitter usernameis replaced with an id of type userABC.
Weanonymize the usernames in this way to avoidmalicious use of the data (e.g., by spammers).Note that usernames are anonymized consis-tently, i.e., every time user A is mentioned inthe stream, he is replaced with the same id.1http://stream.twitter.com/2http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/legalcodeTable 1: N-gram statistics.N-grams tokens uniqueUnigrams 2,263,886,631 31,883,775Bigrams 2,167,567,986 174,785,693Trigrams 2,072,595,131 948,850,4704-grams 1,980,386,036 1,095,417,876?
posting method ?
method used to publish thetweet (e.g., web, API, some Twitter client).Given that there are dozen of Twitter clients inuse today, we believe this information could bevery useful in determining, e.g., any differencesin content that comes through different clients.The format of our data is very simple.
Each linehas the following format:timestamp \t username \t tweet \t clientwhere \t is the tab character, and client is the pro-gram used for posting the tweet.
Note that the ad-ditional whitespaces seen above are only added forreadability, and don?t exist in the corpus.2 Corpus statisticsWe collected the corpus from a period spanningNovember 11th 2009 until February 1st 2010.
As wasalready mentioned, the data was collected throughTwitter?s streaming API and is thus a representa-tive sample of the entire stream.
Table 1 shows thebasic n-gram statistics ?
note that our corpus con-tains over 2 billion words.
We made no attempt todistinguish between English and non-English tweets,as we believe that a multilingual stream might be ofuse for various machine translation experiments.Table 2 shows some basic statistics specific to theTwitter stream.
In particular, we give the numberof users that posted the tweets, the number of links(URLs) in the corpus, the number of topics and thenumber of replies.
From the first two rows of Table 225Table 2: Twitter-specific statistics.Unique Totaltweets - 96,369,326users 9,140,015 -links - 20,627,320topics 1,416,967 12,588,431replies 5,426,030 54,900,387clients 33,860 -Table 3: Most cited Twitter usersUsername number of replies@justinbieber 279,622@nickjonas 95,545@addthis 56,761@revrunwisdom 51,203@ 50,565@luansantanaevc 49,106@donniewahlberg 46,126@eduardosurita 36,495@fiuk 33,570@ddlovato 32,327we can see that the average number of tweets per useris 10.5.
Topics are defined as single word preceded bya # symbol, and replies are single words preceded bya @ symbol.
This is the standard way Twitter usersadd metadata to their posts.
For topics and replies,we give both the number of unique tokens and thetotal number of tokens.Table 3 shows a list of 10 users which received themost replies.
The more replies a user receives, moreinfluential we might consider him.
We can see thatthe two top ranking users are Justin Bieber and NickJonas, two teenage pop-stars who apparently have abig fan base on Twitter.
In fact, six out of ten userson the list are singers, suggesting that many artistshave turned to Twitter as a means of communicatingwith their fans.
Note also that one of the entries isan empty username ?
this is probably a consequenceof mistakes people make when posting a reply.Similarly to Table 3, Table 4 shows the ten mostpopular topics in our corpus.
We can see that themost popular topics include music (#nowplaying,#mm ?
music monday), jobs ads, facebook updates(#fb), politics (#tcot ?
top conservatives on Twit-ter), and random chatter (#ff ?
follow friday, #tiny-chat, #fail, #formspringme).
The topic #39;s is anerror in interpreting the apostrophe sign, which hasthe ascii value 39 (decimal).Table 4: Most popular topics on TwitterTopic number of occurences#nowplaying 255,715#ff 220,607#jobs 181,205#fb 144,835#39;s 110,150#formspringme 85,775#tcot 77,294#fail 56,730#tinychat 56,174#mm 52,971Figure 1: Different sources of tweets.Figure 1 shows the ten most popular clients usedfor posting to Twitter.
Despite the large amountof different Twitter clients used (over 33 thousand,cf.
Table 2), figure 1 shows that almost 80% of all thetweets in our corpus were posted using one of the topten most popular clients.
We can see that traditionalposting through the Twitter web site is still by farthe most popular method, while UberTwitter andTweetDeck seem to be the next most popular choices.3 ConclusionIn this paper we presented a corpus of almost 100million tweets which we made available for publicuse.
Basic properties of the corpus are given and asimple analysis of the most popular users and topicsrevealed that Twitter is in large part used to talkabout music by communicating both with artists andother fans.
We believe that this corpus could bea very useful resource for researchers dealing withsocial media, natural language processing, or large-scale data processing.26
