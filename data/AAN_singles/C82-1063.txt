?Methodology and results of complex computationalanalysis of present-day standard Czech are pre-sented.
According to computer programmes variouslinguistic observations were achieved, concerningespecial ly dependency syntax.INTRODUCTIONThe aim of this paper is to present the methodology and resultsof a detailed analysis of syntactic structures in Czech, perfor-med with the aid of computer.
This work is a part of a large andlong-term project, known as Quantitative analysis of present-daystandard Czech, which is carried out in the Department of mathe-matical l inguistics at the Czech language Institute under theleadership of M. T~i te lova  ~1 ~, \[2\].
Some hitherto achieved re-sults have already been published in special monographs /e.g.
thefrequency dict ionaries of publicist and administrat ive styles \[31,t4\], a volume of quantitative characterist ics of publicist style\[5\]- these prints were issued by the Czech language Institute,Prague/ or as articles and papers e.g.
in PBML 31 and 32 \[6\] andPSML 7 and 8 tT\]; other articles are to be published within a shorttime /as e.g.
the frequency dictionary of scientif ic Czech/ or theyhave been already prepared for publication.PROPOSITIONS AND SYNTACTIC CODEThe target of the syntactic analysis as well as of the whole pro-ject is to obtain a coherent set of mutually related quantitativeparameters concerning the Czech language system, its functioningin different communicative spheres, as well as its stylistic va-lues.
To guarantee the reliabil ity and representativeness of re-391392 L. UHLII~OV~,, I. NEBESK,g, and J. KR,~LfKsults, the research is based on the corpt;s of 540 000 word-forms/occurrences/ chosen from non-narrat ive /i.e.
newspaper, administra-tive and scientific/ texts.
During the preparatory works all word--forms in 180 samples - each sample consisting of 3000 runningword-forms - were supplied with a special code carrying both mor-phological and syntactic information about parts of speech, allmain morphological  categories, relevant in Czech /such as case,nominal gender and number, person, number, tense, mood, voice ofverbs etc.
with a very detailed subcategorization/ and all mainsyntactic categories /such as subject, object, predicate, attributestypes of adverbials etc., again with the necessary subcategories/.The syntactic code was basically digital, with three exceptions:the characters "+" and "-" expressed whether the dependent senten-ce element follows or precedes the governing word /sentence member/,and the character "!"
was used for special defective sentence con-structions.
For purposes of frequency lists, each word-form wasgiven a basic lexical information /lemma/.The coding and lemmatization was done by Linguists in such a way,that after marking boundaries between sentences and clauses eachword-form was given information about its syntactic function/"membership in sentence"/ and about its governing word in the de-pendency tree.
Each clause was then given information about itsstructural position in the complex or compound sentence~ thencoordination between words or between clauses was marked; finally,information about the linear arrangement of words in sentences,of clauses in complex and compound sentences, and of sentence who-les in text was added, so as to enable the complete reconstructionof running texts by computer, if necessary, at any time.The whole corpus  together  w i th  the  encoded in fo rmat ion  came bymeans of  punched cards  /80 co lumns/  over  a cur rent  input  programmein to  externa l  computer  memory on magnet ic  tapes  /each  tape  L ib rarycan car ry  max.
30 texts ,  the  whole corpus  i s  conta ined  in  7 tapes / .Each record  got  a spec ia l  t rans la t ion  zone to  guarantee  the  poss i -b i l i ty  of  ob l igatory  /non-s tandard /  sor t ing  w i th  respect  to  d i f fe -rent  a lphabet ic  o rder ing  of  some Czech Let te rs  / record  s i ze  on ta -pe i s  130, b lock  s i ze  BS=6502/ .

Number of resultsof this kind was obtained by means of reading or repeated readingof the magnetic tape library and through simple adding of differentcode items.The received data offer us a basic survey about the frequencies ofsentence elements and simple, complex and compound sentences,about types of syntagms /both determinative and coordinative/,about the frequencies of two-element and one-element sentences andtheir patterns, about the frequencies of types of subordinateclauses, some word-order and clause-order characterist ics and thefrequency ratio of simple and complex/compound sentences.
In addi-tion, there have been collected some data concerning how oftenvarious sentence elements are expressed by a nominal or an adver -bial phrase and how often they are expressed by a dependent clause,concerning the most frequent types of complex sentences, includingfrequencies and functions of various syntactic connectors.
Usingthe cycles within counting programmes the distr ibutions of syntac-tic units were obtained in a similarly simple and prompt way.This part of the computer work yielded the length distr ibutions ofclauses and sentences expressed in number of words, or in numberof clauses.COMPOUND COMPUTATIONAL CHARACTERISTICSBy doubling or chaining of testing subprogrammes and cycles anotherset of programmes was constructed for more complicated searchingand output of syntactic characteristics.

UHLll~OV?, I. NEBESK/~ and J. KR~,LIKles, as well as larger sets of numeric data supplying rich materialfor further steps of analysis were obtained.
Whereas the resultsof the programme set mentioned above referred to frequencies ofindividual syntactic categories, the programmes reported about inthis paragraph were concentrated on their relationships.
Atten-tion was paid especial ly to the relationships between syntacticelements and their part-of-speech appurtenance, to the syntacticrelevance of some morphological  categories /e.g.
of noun cases/,to the correlation between sentence length and complexity of itsstructure, to the relationship between types of subordinate clau-ses and their linear position in complex sentences etc.
Some ofthe statist ical data obtained have confirmed our intuitive expec-tations /e.g.
concerning syntactic functions of parts of speechand syntactic functions of cases of nouns/, others lead us toa deeper insight into interrelat ions between linguistic levels,esp.
about the connection between the lexical and the syntacticlevels.TYPES OF VERBAL CONTEXTS SEARCHED BY COMPUTERUsing the computer operation memory we overcame the technical im-possibit i ty of a reverse magnetic tape reading.
This enabled us toprepare the third set ofoutput we received wholenents with required codeprogrammes with many variations.
As ansentences, sentence types or their compo-combinations or with immediate verbalcontexts.
Thus we could study not only abstract syntactic catego-ries as such, reported above, but we also could take into accountthe concrete lexical manifestat ions of various syntactic elements,units and categories.Some interesting tendencies were found, concerning the insertionof certain lexical types into different syntactic positions, e.g.types of adjectives typical for predicative posit ions and othertypical for attr ibutive positions.
The relationship between thesemantics of the co-ordinated syntactic elements and their functionsin topic-comment structure was studied, the correlation betweenthe frequencies of subordinate clauses and lexical semantics ofthe governing predicate was proved /with predicates expressingthe attitude of the speaker to the content of communication/,  thecorrelation between morphological  category of infinit ive and se-mantic category of modality was found.
A special attention wasCOMPUTATIONAL DATA ANALYSIS FOR SYNTAX 395paid to the syntactic structures with verbs to be and to have.MAIN RESULTS AND PERSPECTIVESThe hitherto made experiences have shown that even a very extensi-ve statist ico- l inguist ic project can be successful ly carriedthrough, if ~here is the aid of computer.
Results obtained up tonow offer a very detailed picture about the functional load of syn-tactic elements and units in texts from various styles and from va-rious communicative spheres of the present-day Czech.
However, theimportance of the project, which has not yet been completely finis-hed, consists also in the recognition and understanding of quanti-tative linguistic principles, relationships, tendencies and gene-ral laws.Statistics of syntax contrasts by some of its features with thestatistics of other linguistic levels.
If compared with somehierarchical ly lower levels, such as with phonology or morphology,and their units, the sentence as the basic syntactic unit isstructural ly much more complex /not representing the mere summ ofelements and forms of the lower levels/ and, larger, too.
Forthese reasons it disposes with a considerably higher combinationpossibi l it ies, and consequently of richer posibi l i t ies of indivi-dual usage of linguistic means of its creation and usage duringthe communicative process.
On the other hand, if compared withconcrete lexical items, most properties of sentence are of abst-ract, categorial nature; the inventory of sentence patterns isstrictly limited in number, and therefore they are repeated veryoften in texts, which of course contributes to the neutral izat ionof their st~listic value.The computer aided quantitative analysis of syntax proved to bea valuable counterpart of qualitative structural research in descri-bing and evaluating the functioning of language means in communi-cation.396 L.
