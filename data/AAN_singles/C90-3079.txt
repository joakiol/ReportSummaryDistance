INTRODUCTIONWeather forecasts (WF) are thesubject of various manipulations.Evolving as sets of numerical data andqual i tat ive estimations they grow intocomplete images of expectedmeteorological situations representedin the form of texts in NL, weathermaps, data tables or combinedinformation objects.
Then the WF couldbe translated f rom one language toanother, transformed from verbal top ictor ia l  form or vice versa, etc.Such kind of manipulations are oftenperformed by forecasters, translators,editors in order to obtain betterrepresentation of the WF from thepoint of view of i t s  perception andunderstanding.There is  some exper ience w i th  suchkind of automat ic  handl ing of d i f fe r~ent c lasses of spec ia l i zed  texts ,  TheHETEO system \[7\]  t rans la tes  WFs fromEng l i sh  to French.

D i f fe rent  types of t rans format ion  can be representedas a composition of analysis and synthesis379I t  is read as "Weather characteristicsW are expected in the region R duringthe period l".
For each of the itemsW, T, R a taxonomy is created  thatdefines the quantities used togetherwith their scales.
Each taxonomy rep-resents a particular submodel.
Thepresent model does not reflect thedegree of uncertainty in WFs.The in terna l  representat ion  of anyWF is  a cons is tent  set  S of asser t ionsfo rmulated  in  terms of the conceptua lmodel.3.
TEXT ANALYSISAnalysis is the process oftransforming the text of a given WFinto its i n terna l  representation.
Itconsists of the following steps:data extraction -- identifyingtl~e strings in the text that representthe values of the assertion items(such strings are called f i l l e rs  ofthe corresponding quantity);- data translation -- representingthe f i l l e rs  in terms of the conceptualmodel;- e l l ips is  resolution -- completinge l l ip t i ca l  phrases with informationextracted from their contexts;- inconsistency elimination -- re-placing contradictory assertions bynon-contradictory ones.3.1.
Data extractionThe technique for data extractionis based on a formal description ofthe typical phrases of WFs by means oftransition networks called analyzers\[3\], The conditions along the arcs ofthe network are checks for certainsemantic primitives defined in adictionary or comparisons with certainstrings.
Some of the nodes are markedby two types of symbols mb(x) andme{x), where x is the ident i f ier  of aquantity in the conceptual model, mbmeans that a f i i l e r  of x begins, memarks the end of the f i l l e r  of x.3.2 .
Data translationThose entries of the dictionarythat may occur as f i l l e rs  havesections where the meaning of thef i l l e r  is defined by the correspondingterm of the conceptual model.
Thus,the data translation process consistsof looking up in the dictionary forthe current f i l l e r ,  picking out thecontents of the corresponding sectionand replacing the f i l l e r  by the termextracted.
Numerical values such astemperature degrees are calculatedautomatically from the text.3.3.
El l ips is  resolutionA good deal of sentences in WFs aree11i@tical.
For example, consider theWF in Fig.
l ,  where the region ismissing from the f i r s t  assertion andtlle time period is not specified inthe second assertion.
In order tocomplement them a context analysis isperformed.
I t  is based on certainheuristics represented as rules.
Forthe particular case of medium-rangeforecasts in Bulgarian such rules aregiven in \[4\] where four variables areused, namely a short--term and along-term backgrounds of both thetime-period and the region.
The rulesspecify the conditions under whichthese variables change their values aswell as the variable whose valueshould f i l l  in the current e l l ip t i ca lassertion.3.4 .
Inconsistency e l iminat ionTWO assertions (W~ , ~ ,R 4) and(~ ,~,R  z) are  said to becontradictory i f  they predictinconsistent weather characteristics(e.g.
sunny weather and overcast) foroverlapping regions and time periods.The following heuristic is applied toeliminating contradictory assertions.The more spec i f i ca l ly  the informationis given, the higher pr io r i ty  i t  has.In terms of the conceptual model i tmeans that i f  W i and are~nconsistent, O,c~ and 4c~en the~econd assertion is replaced by theassertion (W z ,~-~,~-~) ,  where &-5and Rz-Riare calculated on the basisof the corresponding submodels.4.
TEXT SYNTHESISSynthesis is the process of trans=forming the internal representation ofa given WF into a text in a certain NLand according to a certain scheme(discourse structure).
I t  consists ofthe following stages:- generation of words and phrasesrepresenting the items of theassertions;- generation of sentencesdescribing the assertions;generation of text fragmentscontaining all the weather informationrelated to a certain region, timeperiod or weather phenomenon dependingon the scheme adopted.The three generators are calledphrase generator ,  sentence generatorand discourse generator, respectively.They are presented in detail in \[5\]for the case of short-range forecastsin Bulgarian.4.1 .
Discourse generatorThe process  of generat ion  i s  aLop-down one.
F i r s t ,  the asser t ionsare ar ranged accord ing  to thed i scourse  s t ructure ,  de f inedpreliminarily in terms of theconceptual model.
For example~ onefeasible discourse structure is therequirement to present the WF in foursections containing information forthe regions North, East, South andWest Bulgaria, respectively.
In eachsection the information should bearranged according to weatherphenomena in the following order:cloudiness, precipitation, wind and380 2temperature.
The discourse generatorscans the in terna l  representat ion  andsorts out the assertions into thepredefined sections, whereby some~ssert ions  (e.g.
those re fer r ing  tothe whote country)  may fa l l  in to  morethan one sect ion .
Ins ide each sect ionthe asser t ions  are reordered by the i r~eather character i s t i cs .
Other discourse~tructures  can be processed as wel l .4,2.
Sentence generatorThe generation of simple sentencesrepresenting single assertions and~ompound sentences representing groupsof assertions is performed accordingto certain rules.
The simple sentence~)tructure is defined by means ofpatterns.
The choice of the actualpattern is made on the basis of thevalues of the current assertion.Compound sentences are used whencertain patterns of assertions occur:in the f inal form of the internalrepresentation.
5ix specific rules forconstructing compound sentences aredefined, one of them is shown below:(w,, R, =BUt) ===> ?wI en"4.3.
Phrase generatorAfter the sentence structure hasbeen settled, the phrase generator isinvoked to form the phrases describingthe assertion items.
I t  replaces theterms of the internal representationby corresponding phrases ~n NL.
Forthis purpose a reversed dictionary isu~;ed.5.
MAP GENERATIONMap generation is the process oftransforming the internal representa-tion of a glven NF into a weather map.WFs are expressed on the map by meansof stylized depictions as pictogramsand symbols.
The form and possibly thecolor of the depictions reflect thecharacteristics of certain weatherphenomena while the positions of thedepictions on the map correspond tothe regions where these phenomena areexpected to happen.
There are noestablished rules for representingtime on the map.
The most simplesolution from such a point of viewconsists of creating different mapsfor each of the periods of a givenscale.
More sophisticated solutionsprovide with specific means of timeexpression such as animation, symbolicrepresentation of processes, expl ic i ttime notation of the phenomena beingrepresented, etc.The technique for map generationm~ployed in this project consists oftwo steps:- t ime analysis of the internalri~presentation resulting in a properdivision of the assertions into groupsaccording to the model adopted fort~me representation;scanning tho assertions of eachgroup and translating them into depic.tions corresponding to the weatheritems and arranged in some positionson the map depending on the regions.The arrangement is based on apreliminarily designed template of themap.
The template contains the spotswhere depictions could potentiallyappear?
Together with the template amapping M is defined.
For any pair'(W,R) fl determines the set of spotswhere the corresponding dep ic t ion  isto be placed.
The dep ic t ions  used areprepared in advance through aspecialized graphical editor.6.
CONCLUSIONThe three techniques presented herehave been implemented on an IBM PC/ATmicrocomputer with EGA monitor for thecase of medium-range WFs for Bulgariaissued by the Office of Hydrology andf leteoro logy in Sof ia.The technique for text  analys is  wasestimated by analyzing 100 WFs fromBulgarian newspapers.
About 85-90~ ofthe data items were extracted andtranslated correctly by the system.The subsystems for text synthmsis andmap generation produce WFs ofacceptable quality.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, This project wassupported by the Presidium of theBulgarian Academy of Sciences (grantNo 1001003) and by the Committee forScience and Higher Education (grant No607).
