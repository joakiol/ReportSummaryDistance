1 Universal Quantification in Machine TranslationCornelia ZELINSKY-WIBBELTIAI / EUROTRA - DMartin-Luther-StraOe 14D-6600 Saarbriicken 3AbstractThis approach has been developed in the context of theEUROTRA machine translation (MT) project and thus has beendes igned  w i th  respect  to a syntax  based s t ra t i f i ca t iona ltranslation process?
We assume that in a semantic representationdeterminers are deleted and that their semantic function whichis represented by semantic features is percolated into themothernode.
The semant ic  funct ions  of determiners  areexplicated.
The interaction between grammatical and lexicalquantif ieatiun is outlined.
Ensemble theory is applied to the"count" /"mass"  noun d is t inc t ion .
T rans fer  of quantif icationbetween German, English, and French is i l lustrated with respectto the "count"/"mass" distinction.
The article closes with anoutlook on \[he relevance of generalized quantifiers for MachineTranslation.1.
Semantic representation of determiners in EUROTRAEUROTRA aims at defining a semantic representation whichguarantees simple transfer between all European languages, thatis, it should be "euroversal".
The concept of "euroversality"implies, amongst others, a semantic representation i  a canonicalform out or" which all European languages may be generated.With respect o this canonical form it is reasonable to delete thedeterminers during translation into the semantic representationand to represent heir meaning by semantic features of the NP.This step may be motivated primarily by two facts:(1) Languages vary with respect to the use of 0-determiners.
(2) The set properties realized by an entity areexpressed ifferently in different languages.Tim idea that determiners are not deep structure constituents,but that their surface structure constituents have to be generatedfrom a semantic representation is not new.
It can already befound for example in PERLMUTTER 1970.
Moreover, torepresent he quantif ier by means of semantic features of theNP implies that the entity which is focussed by the process ofdetermination cannot be referred to directly, but only as theargument of the determiner which provides a new referent (cf.P INKAL  1986).
BARWISE & COOPER (1981) cons iderdeterminers as two-place predicates which take the noun whichis the domain of quantif ication as one argument, and the rest ofthe sentence, which is the predicate quantified as the otherargument.
With respect to the EUROTRA MT system this hasimportant implications for the translation between the syntacticdependency level - the EUROTRA Relational Structure (ERS)and the semant ic  level  - the in ter face  St ructure  (IS).Determiners which have the function of modifying nouns atERS on the basis of several syntactic conditions establishdif ferent types of determination.
Those types of determinationare the ba,;is for deduc ing  (i.e.
t rans la t ing)  exact ly  thatinformation which yields the new referent in the NP byunifying with the semantic features of the noun.Although both determiners and quantifiers have characteristicfunctions, they have others in common, so that a borderline isdiff icult to draw.
Cases of crossclassification exist in manylanguages, as for example the one constituted by Germander/ein/O, French le/un/O, English the/a/O (cf.
VATER1963).
This is why we describe both determiners and quantifiersby a common set of semantic features.2.
The semantic functionsIt is agreed in the literature that determiners and quantifiersshare the function of DELIMITATION (cf.
VATER 1980).
Thisdelimitation consists in the localisation of a referent in thespeech or textual context or the non-l inguistic situation or inrelation to the presupposed knowledge of the hearer or reader(only the first of these functions, and this again in a ratherrestricted way, may be represented in the EUROTRA system).BARWISE & COOPER (1981) refer  to this funct ion  ofde l imi ta t ion  as the proper ty  " l ives on" and def ine  thatdeterminers "assign to common count noun denotations (i.e.
sets)A a quantif ier that lives on A."
(BARWISE & COOPER1981.179)2.1.
Quantif ication over whole sets: "generic" versus"identifying"It is the function of determiners and quantifiers to quantify overgets of entities.
The writer's motivation to create sets is that theentities which should be members of the set share one or severalpropert ies .
Fo l lowing the t rad i t ion  of the MONTAGUEapproach, BARWISE & COOPER treat all NPs as quantifierswhich denote sets of properties of individuals.
There are twobasic types of WHOLE SETS, which may be created.
(l) The entity's extens ion  is created "generically" by meansof it's inherent lexical meaning as in the followingexample:Die Linguisten sind in formalen Sprachen geiibt(Linguists are practised in formal languages.).
(2)Here the NP quantifies exactly over the complete set oflinguists of the actual world.An lntensional property of the entity set makes possibleit's "identification".
In this case a WItOLE SET isreferred to which is precisely delimited (cf.
VATI?
;R1963, PLATTEAU 1980).
This type of entity set mayonly be established context-sensitive.
It is thus a setwhich may be referred to as a WHOLE SET only withrespect to a certain domain of interpretation, which isthe intensional property:The linguists of EUROTRA ...This NP quantif ies exactly over that set of linguists whowork for EUROTRA,2.2.
The semantic functions of determiners: determiners asvariables and as variable-binding fnnctionsIt is the function of determiners to select one or several entitiesfrom a set of entit ies (cf.
PLATTEAU 1980).The salient function of indefinite determiners is equivalent othat of the existential quantif ier (cf.
LANGENDONCK 1980,PLATTEAU 1980); they introduce new entities into the speechor text situation.
Thus they only express that entities exist in thespeech situation, without "specifying" which.
It is an infinite setof a potent ia l  of ent i t ies  (cf.
HAWKINS 1978.198).
We maytherefore say that indefinite determiners in their salient functionare variables.
This yields a PARTIAL SET of entities which is"existential".Beside this salient function the indefinite determiner may also"specify" entities, if it is clear in the universe of discourse whichentity is designated (ef.
OOMEN 1977 and DI EUGENIO 1986).791The salient function of definite determiners i that the existenceof an.
entity is already presupposed by the writer, i.e.
the writerpresupposes that the entity is already given, that the reader isalready acquainted with it (cf.
OOMEN 1977).
Now the variablewhich is presupposed to have been assigned to the entity(entities) by the indefinite determiner is bound:We need another linguist for EUROTRA-D.
The linguistshould be a specialist in s.vntax.The definite article thus yields a WHOLE SET of entities whichis precisely l imited by a fixed reference point, that is it is"identified".2.3.
ClassifiersA special case of indefiniteness may be said to be whatLANGENDONCK calls "indefiniteness with asserted partition"in opposition to "ordinary asserted partition".
We said above thatit is the function of determination to select an entity or entitiesout of a set.
We can also say that they partition a set into thoseentities which are members of a subset and those which are not.With "ordinary asserted partition" expressed by an indefinitedeterminer and a noun this partitioned set is an infinite set of apotential of individuals.
"Indefinites with asserted partition" areclassifier constructions.
They constitute the clearest instance ofexc lus iveness  or par t i t ion ing ,  in par t i cu la r  par t i t i veconstructions with the semantic structure\[3x 1(xl_c x~)\].(cf.
LANGENDONCK 1980.213).
Exactly the same holds forthis structure that holds for the relation between definite andindef in i te  determinat ion :  A potent ia l  subset of ent i t ies  ispresupposed, when a specific part of those is asserted:this part of the article ...Beside the feature "partitive" the features "sortal", "collective","mensurar', "scale", and "nnmerative" become relevant in therealization of this structure.3.
Determination of the set propertiesThe fact that the set to be quantif ied is greater than one isexpressed by different surface structures in the Europeanlanguages.
With proper  "count ''z nouns p lu ra l i ty  may bedesignated by the plural morpheme (the determiners).
With"discontinuous" "mass" nouns classifiers may be used in order topartition the mass into amounts and thus make the partionedmasses (not the mass on its own!)
countable (several pieces ofadvice, different boxes of vegetables).
Finally, a "collective"refers to a set which is greater than one (the furn i ture) .
InGerman the individuation of certain "abstract" mass" entitiesmay simply be achieved by the plural morpheme.
The use of theGerman plural is only impossible with nouns which designate"continuous" "masses".3.1.
The interaction of lexical and grammatical quantificationA noun designates an entity the inherent setforming propertiesof  wh ich  are  lex ica l i zed .
By means  of  g rammat ica lquantif ication this entity may form different sets.
On the onehand there are entities, the inherent setforming properties ofwhich may not be influenced grammatically, but which mayonly designate on their own.
This is the case with "continuous""mass" nouns; we may also say that they des ignate  setsabsolutely.
On the other hand there are entities which are notable to form sets on their own.
This holds for "discontinuous""mass" entities; they may also be considered as designating setsby a variable with respect o their lexical potential, this variableonly being fil led by a constant by grammatical context.
From alogical point of view this idea' is developed more precisely andmoreover integrated into a coherent system in BUNT 1979 and1985.
In the following we will apply this system to language.
"Continuous" ensembles (of.
BUNT) are true "masses" which maynot be enumerated that is they may not be designated by aplural expression.
They satisfy QUINES cumulat ive reference792condit ion,  or more precisely, the distr ibutive referencecondition.
The cumulative reference of mass nouns implies thatthe union of any two masses W is again W. Or vice versa thedistr ibutive reference condition means that any part of somemass W must again be W. If we refer to "continuous" ensembles,we do not imagine any smallest part of the ensemble which maynot be divided any more without the ensemble ceasing to bewhat it was.
A prototypical "continuous" ensemble is thatreferred to by the "mass" noun time.
The following syntacticcondition holds:(1) All nonpluralizable "mass" nouns are "continuous".This means that the property of continuity is lexical.
Examplesof nouns re fer r ing  to "cont inuous  .
.
.
.
mass" ent i t ies  areparticipation, impetus, increase, adhesion, intportanee, xtent.Contrary to the mode of reference to "continuous" masses is thatto "d iscont inuous"  ensembles  or sets.
While the feature"discontinuous" is lexical, its subspecifications are only realizedin interaction with grammatical structure:"Atomic" sets or ensembles cannot be imagined to have anygenuine (=nonempty) parts, that is(2) All "count" and "discontinuous" "mass" entitiesdesignated by singular nouns are "atomic".
"Atomic" sets or ensembles may, however, be merged into"discrete" sets or ensembles which are constituted either by"individual" count" entities or by entities which are basically"mass", but which may be turned into an ensemble which weconceive of as having genuine parts e.g by being represented byseveral amounts.
This is expressed by pluralization or bypreceding classifiers, as e.g.
with advice, which gets enumerableby the "numerative" piece.
This is not possible with "continuous"mass entities, as e.g.
those designated by the nouns importance,research.Moreover, "collectives" are "discrete".
Now we can summarize:(3) The des ignat ion  of "d iscreteness"  is y ie lded bypluralized "count" and "mass" nouns as well as by"collective" nouns (cf.
ALLAN 1976.99, where he definesthe result of collectivizing as the unmarked (singular)form of plural reference).4.
Transfer of quantified nounphrasesWe start from our condition developed in the previous chapterthat p lu ra l i zab i l i ty  is represented  by the lex ica l  features"discontinuous" and "continuous".
Singular NPs then have to betranslated into three semantically different NPs at IS:(1) Into an "atomic" NP if and only if a "count" or "mass"noun for which "complexity" does not equal "collective",and for which "distribution" equals "discontinuous".
(2) Into a "continuous" NP if and only if a "continuous""mass" noun is generated.
(3) Into a "discrete" NP then and only then, if a "collective"noun is generated.The source IS - representat ion  of an atomic  NP wi l l  betransferred into the identical target IS-representation with theexclusion of the features "mass" and "count".

4 Transfer from les conseils into der RatThe feature "continuous" blocks pluralization.
In the case ofnumera l  quant i f i ca t ion  the  German noun must  beD ISCONTINUOUS;  in this ease un i f i ca t ion  succeeds  withRatschlag, which is "count'r, "individual", "discontinuous", that is"atomic" in the case of  a one-element set and "discrete" in theease of a set that has more than one element.

"individual", and hence "discontinuous", or "mass" and"collective", that is, it is also "discontinuous" in thissecond reading.
On the basis of their morphosyntacticbehaviour both readings yield a "discrete" NP(2) The translation from French into English yields twoidentical translations, as only one lexical unit with the"collective" reading exists in English: the furniture whichis lexically "mass", "collective", and hence yields a"discrete" NP, so that in the case of being quantified thequantifier is again followed by piece.
One of theidentical readings has to be killed.
(3) If we translate from French into German, the NP withthe "individual" noun is translated into die MObelsti~cke,which has the same features, both in the NP and in then.
The French NP with the "collective" n is translatedinto die MObel, which also has the same features, bothfor NP and n. In the case of a preceding cardinalnumber phrase the German noun MObelstiick with amorpheme as "numerative" must be generated.
TheGerman noun in this case is "count", "individual","discontinuous", that is "atomic" in the case of a one-element set and "discrete" in the case of a set which has?
more than one element.4.1.
ConclusionIt was the intention of this chapter to point out how two typesof semantic features with lexical and grammatical origin whichquantify the nounphrase interact in transfer:From the dictionaries we generate those semantic featuresquantifying the set of entities which refer to the constitution ofthe ent i ty  ( "count" / "mass" ,  " ind iv idua l " / "co l tec t ive" /"partitive"/"sortal", "eontinuous"/"discontinuous"), while in theunmarked ease the setforming properties are transferred fromsource to target language representation by a default rule("discrete"/"atomie").
More precisely, an "atomic" set alay s goesto an "atomic" set, a "discrete" set normally goes to a "discrete"set, it may, however, go to a "continuous" set, if a continuousentity is generated from the dictionary as in the case of thecorrespondence b tween les conseils and der Rat/the advice.
Inthe same way a "continuous" set normally goes to a "continuous"set, it may, however, go to a "discontinuous" et as in theopposite translation from der Rat to the advice.5.
Generalized quantlflers in Machine Translation sLet us close with an evaluation of the super/subset relationshipholding for generalized quantifiers and its relevance for machinetranslation.
Indeed, we are convinced, that the properties ofpersistency, monotonieity, strength and weakness, conservativityand others which BARWISE & COOPER (1981) and others haveintroduced are relevant with respect to the disambigation of794determiner readings and thus have to be part of the semanticrepresentation f the NP.
BARWISE & COOPER themselvesmention the ambiguity of a few, which is monotonouslyincreasing (men 1) in its positive reading (at least a few) andnot monotonous in its negative reading (only a few):mon /": 1/ (at least) a few linguists implement, then afew linguists work.mon~,: *'If (only) a few linguists work, then (only) a fewlinguists implement.mon f: *If (only) a few linguists implement, hen onlya few linguists work.The fact that negation reverses monotonicity is realized withmass nouns and pluralized count nouns which in their positivereading appear with zero-article.
In the positive reading whichis men t the partitive article is used in French:I f  there is wine that contains 12% alcohol, then there iswine that contains alcohol.I f  there are wine bottles that contain 12% alcohol, thenthere are wine bottles that contain alcohol.S'il y a du vin qui contient 12 % d'alcool, il y a du vin quicontient de l'alcool.S'il y a des bouteilles de vin qui contiennent 12% d'alcool,il y a des bouteilles de vin qui contiennent de/'alcool.In the negative reading which is monl simple de instead of thepartitive article is used in French:I f  there is no wine that contains alcohol, then there is nowine that contains 12% alcool.I f  there are no bottles of wine that contain alcohol, thenthere are no bottles of wine that contain 12% alcool.S'il n'y apas de vin qui contient d'alcool, il n'y apas devin qui contient 12% de l'alcool.S'il n'a pas de bouteilles de vin qui contiennent d'alcool, il.
n'y a pas de bouteilles de vin qui contiennent de l'alcool.6.
The organization of the semantic features of determinationAs an overview let us give a graphical representation of theorganization of the features.
In this representation the ENTITY-node is the axiom and each node is subspecified either by adisjunction of features, which we represent by the solidlinededges, or by a conjunction of features which we indicate by the"+" marked edges.- -gener ic+++1+ - - ident i fy ing-WHOLE SETt - -without exception~++l , -Mth  exception- - in tens ionat?+I'DELINITATION+ -e + I - -ex i s tent ia t+ + =-PARTIAL SETl--specJfying+ ?

SummaryWe have illustrated several semantic representations which aremeant to guarantee the correct generation of different surfacestructures of quantifiers.
The intricate interwovenness betweenlexical and grammatical quantification has been outlined.
Insome cases as for example in the case of "collective" and"discrete" or "individual" and "atomic" "discontinuity" theambiguity could not be resolved.8.
