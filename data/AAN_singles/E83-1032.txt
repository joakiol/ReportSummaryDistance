The system is destinedfor the use in the field of medicine.Its main purpose is to ensure access toinformation to phlsiclans in a conver-sational manner.
The use of the systemdoes not require ability of programmingfrom its user.I.. IntroductionThe paper presents the state ofelaboration of the natural language in-formation retrieval system DIALOG.
Itsaim is an automatic, conversational ex-traction of facts from a given text.Actually it is real medical text ongastroenterology, which was prepared bya team of specialists.
The system hasa modular structure.The first, and in fact very import-ant module is the language analysis mod-ule.
Its task is to ensure the transi-tion of a medical text from its naturalform, i.e.
rentences formed by phys-icians, into a formal ~ogical notation.This logical notation, i.e.
logical for-mulae, is rather universal and can beeasy adapted to various deductive andknowledge representation methods.
Theprogram of the analyser was written withthe use of the CATN /Cascaded ATN/ tech-nlque, where the syntactic and semanticcomponents constitute separate cascades.In the deduction and knowledge rep-resentation module the weak second orderlanguage was used.

Transformation of natural languagesentences into logical formulaeThe user of the DIALOG system intro-ducing his utterance into the systemcomes into direct contact with the natu-ral language analysis module.
This mod-ule plays the key role in the machinenatural lang1~age communication process.Similarly as in many other informationsystems of this type, e.g.
L\[fMAR /Woods72/, PLANES /Yaltz 76/, SO~FIF, /~urton76/, RENDEZ-VOUS /Codd 78/, PLIDIS/Berry-Rogghe 78/, OIALOGIC /Grosz eta\ ] .82/, the purpose of the module is totransform a text in the natural languageinto a chosen formal representation.
Suc~Such a representationmust meet a numberof requirements.
Firstly, it must be"intelligible" to the internal parts ofthe system, i.e.
the deductive comoonentand/or managing the data base.
Secondly,it must carry in a formal, and clear man-er the sense and meaning of utterancesin natural language.
Finally, the repre-sentation should allow for a reproduc-tion of the original input sentence withthe aim of generating intermediate para-phrases and/or answers for the user.In the parser of the DIALOC, system,we attempted on the gratest, in ouropinion, achievements in the field ofnatural language processing.
The follow-ing works had the greatest influence onthe final form of the module: /Berry--Rogghe 78/, /Bates 78/, /Carbonell 81/,/Cercone 80/, /Chomsky 65/, /Ferrari80/, /Fillmore 68/, /Gershman 79/,/Grosz 82/, /Lnndsbergen 81/, /Marcus80/, /Martin 81/, /Moore 81/, /Robinson82/, /Rosenschein 82/, /Schank 78/,/Steinacker 82/, /Waltz 78/, /Wi\]ensky80/, /Woods 72/ and /Woods 80/.
We havetransferred, with greater or less suc-cess, the most valuable achievementspresented in these works, pertainingt96mainly to the English language process-ing, into our system, using them in thetreatment of the Polish language.
Weattempted thus, to preserve a certaindistance with regard to the language it-self, as well as the subject of conver-sation with the computer, so that theadapted solutions were of a broadercharacter and through that became com-parable with the state of research inthat field in other countries.2 .1 .The  role, wlace and structure ofthe language analysis moduleThe purpose of the language analy-sis module in the DIALOG system is tran-sformation of the user's utterance /inPolish/ into the I order logic formulae.Other formal notations such as II orderlogic formulae, FUZZY formulae, Minskyframes and even the introduction ofintensional logic elements are also con-sidered.
At present, ~e will concentrateon the process of transforming a naturalsentence into a I order logic formula.The system is equipped with twoindependent modules: deduction and database management.
The data for these mod-ules are the formulae generated by theparser.
We will present only one moduleworking on the basis of the we~( secondorder logic.The parsing system consists of thetwo closely cooperating parts: a syntac-tic analyser and a sem(nntlc interpreter.The whole was programmed with the aid o~a mechanism called CATN /Cascaded ATN//Woods 80/, /Bolc, Strzalkowskl 82a,82b//Kochut 83/, where the syntactic compo-nent plays the role of the "upper", i.e.the dominating "cascade".
For the syn-tactic analyser produces a structure ofthe sentence grammatical analysis, whichin turn undergoes a semantical verifica-tion.
In case, where the semantic inter-preter is not able to give the meaningof the sentence, the syntactic componentis activated again with the aim of pre-senting another grammatical analysis.
Ifsuch an analysis cannot be found, theinput sentence is treated as incorrect.2.2.
The syntactic analyserThe syntactic component of the par-ser produces a gra~natical analysis ofthe input sentence in Polish.
This waspossible due to a skillful programmingof rules governing the morphology andsyntax of the language.
Although, thewhole system was oriented towards a de-fined type of texts /medical/, the ac-cepted solutions make it a much moreuniversal tool.
We do not claim that thesyntactic analyser in its present fol-mis able to solve all or the majority ofproblems of the Polish language syntax.It includes, however, rather wide subsetof the colloquial language, enriched byconstructions characteristic for medicaltexts.A natural language sentence intro-duced into the parser undergoes firstlya pretreatment in a so called spellingcorrecter.
If all the words used in thesentence are listed in the system vocabu-lary then the sentence is passed for syn-tactic analysis.
Otherwise the systemattempts to state whether the speakermade a spelling error, giving him achance to correct the error and evensuggesting the proper word, or whether 11eused a word unknown to the system.
In thelast case, the user has a possibility ofintroducing the questioned word into thevocabulary but in practice it may turnout to be too troublesome for him.
Usual-ly then, the user is given a chance ofwithdrawing the unfortunate utterance orformulating it in a different way.The proper syntactic analysis beginsat the moment of activating the first"cascade" of the parser.
It consists offive ATN nets, with the aid of which thegrammar of the subset of the Polish lan-guage has been written.
The two largestnets SENTENCE /sentences/ and N0\[~-P_RR/nominal groups/ play a superiorrole inrelation to others: ADH-PT~A /adiectivegroups/~ ADV-PT~A /adverb groups2 andQ-EXPR /question phrases/.
The process ofsyntactic analysis is usually quite com-plex and uses essentially the non-deter-ministic character of orocessing in ATN.It Is justified by the-specific natureof the Polish language, which is charac-gerised by a developed in~ect ion and aSentence free word order.The result of the syntactic analysisis a grammatical analysis of the inputsentence in the form of a so calledo-form.
It is a nonflexional form ofa sentence, ordered according to a fixedkey.
The construction of the o-form canbe expressed ba the structure:<o- form~ : :=(S (questiqns) i (negation~ I (modalitie~l(predlcate/verb)l (vague~ I (subject) !~direct objectS_| (indirect object> I~(pre~.
phrase)I}"(CAUSE/RES\[~(o-forn~\]END)The stick mark "|,, is usually used as asymbol of the meta-language.
Here it isused as a symbol of the defined language.Symbols S and END comnrise a singleclause.
A clause expresses every elemen-tary activity or event expressed in the197input sentence.
Often, the o-form hasa richer structure than a classicalanalysis tree.
The elements of theo-form called ~subject~ , (direct ob-Ject~ , (indirect objectS, and ~adJect-ive phrase) can also be expressed ormodified with the use of clauses.
Thestick marks "I" separate the parts ofthe o-form and are its constatnt ele-ments.
Then transformed nuestion issubjected to semantic interpretation.The syntactic analyser manages thevocabulary, where infle?ional forms ofwords are kept.
The vocabulary defini-tion specifies the syntactic categories,to which given words belong.
It alsodescribes forms of words with the aid oflexlcalparameters: case, number, personand gender.
These parameters are of gretvalue in examining the grammatical con-struction of sentences.2.3.
The semantic interpreterWhen the syntactic analysis is suc-cessfully completed the o-form of theinput dentence is forwarded for the sem-antic interpretation.
The syntactic"cascade" is suspended, i.e.
removedfrom the operational field, leavingplace for the semantic "cascade".
Theconfiguration of the removed "cascade"is remembered thus, in case of necessityof generating an alternative grammaticalanalysis.The semantic interpreter consistsof the two main parts: a constant con-trolling part, working on the basis ofa very general pattern adjustment, andcompatible experts algorithms, wherethe knowledge of the system in the fieldof conversation has been coded.
The pro-cess of interpretation is assisted bya special vocabulary of semantic rulesand on additional vocabulary complement-ing the expert knowledge.The sentence in the o-form is for-warded directly to the controlling partof the interpreter, where such its par-ameters as time, negation, aspect ....are evaluated first.
Then the centralpredicative element of the sentence"calls for" a proper semantic rule,which from then will guide the interpre-tation process.
The rule has a form of~ pattern-concept pair /Wilensky 80/Gershman 79/, /Carbonell 81/, where ~hepattern reflects the scheme of an ele-mentary event, wheras the concept indi-cates how its meaning should be express-ed through formulae.
The semantic ruleis activated for the time of interpre-tation of a single clause.
If the pattern is adjusted to the cl~use, anatomic formula is generated, expressingthe meaning of the clause.
The meaningof the whole sentence is expressed asa logical combination of meanings of allthe o-form clauses.
The semantic rulesbring different /on the surface/ descrip-tions of the same phenomenon into a com-mon interpretation.The.general structure of formulaegenerated by the interpreter is ex-pressed by an implication:41^~2^ ...^~n-~"where ~ has been introduced from a sem-antic rule and~i  come from the systemknowledge - special compatible partsof the interpreter called the experts.Individual o-form phrases, in the con-text of the dialogue subject, are inter-preted in experts.In our system, designed for conver-sation with a phlsician, we have expertsfor names of sicknesses /SICKNESS/,names of ~rgaus /ORGAN/, internal sub-stances /oUBSTANCE/, therapies /TREAT-~NT/ ,  medicaments /MEDICAmeNT/ andnames of animate objects /ANIMATE/ andthe remaining objects foreign to thebody /PHYSOBJ/.
Experts are activatedon the request of a proper semantic rule.The controlling part of the inter~eter"instructs" the expert/s/ chosen by thepattern to interpret a notion or expres-sion.
The indicated expert can solve theproblem on its o~m or seek for the helpof other experts.
Often, one complex ex-pression has to be gualified by two orthree exprrts.All the experts, as well as thecontrolling part of the interpreter/FOR~UJLA, CASES and QWORDS nets/ havebeen recoreded in ATN formalism and forma lower "cascade" of the parser.The interpreter is also egulppedwith a mechanism of context pronominalreference solution.2.4.
Examples of transformation of amedica l text  into logical formulaeWe will present two examples oftransformation of medical sentences intoI order logic formulae.
Before that,a few words on the adopted convention offormula notation.
The symbols IMPLSYMand KONJSYM are logical operators/implication/ andS/con junct ion /  re-spectively.
Integer placed directlyafter the symbol KONJSYN indicates thenumber of conjlmction factors.
Names ofpredicates are preceded by symbols '~"7hash mark/, and an integer placed rightto the name defines the number of predi-198cate arguments.
The arguments specifytheir type /sort/, name of the variableand constant /if there is one/.Example 1Sentence :Alkehol powoduje r6wnie~ wzrost napi~-cia mi~ni6wki  dwunastnlcy./Alcohol also causes the rise of thetenlcity of the duodenum muscularcoat/o-form:(s  DC~ I I I I ~O:'IODOWAC I RO~VWIEZ IA~KOHOL I s !

The deduction and knowledge repre-sentation moduleThe deduction module is a separatepart of the whole DIALOG system.
Its maizpurpose is to collect and represent theknowledge gained by the system and alsothe ability to use the possessed infor-mation in accordance with the wishes ofthe user of the system.Our work on the achievement of theobjectives indicated above was based onthe experiences pre~ented by E.Konradand N.Klein /Konrad 76/, /Klein 78/ fromTechnical University in West Berlin.In the previous chapter we present-ed how the text, written in Polish, istransformed into I order logic formulae.This, of course, implies the way of rep-resentation of the knowledge presentedin the natural language.3.1.
Knowledge representationThe information included in thelogical formulae coming from the lan-guage module has to be stored for lateruse.
The logical formulae are then in-troduced into the data base.
The database, adequately filled with the men-tioned formulae, constitutes the knowl-edge represenlation carried through thenatural language sentences.
It is asequivalent to the text as the I orderlogic allows to convey the meaning of th~natural language sentences.Data BaseThe date base consists of three sep-arate parts: a nucleus, ~ amplifier anda filter /Konrad 76/.
Each of the partsincludes a different , from the concep-199%tional point of view, elements:A.
The nucleus includes groud literals,which represent facts occuring in thefield of knowledge represented in thebase.
E.g.the information that the pan-creas is a secretory organ is presentedas a literal(~ WYDZ-NARZAD (TRZUSTtfA)~From the system point of view there isno conceptional difference between thetee facts: the above one,and(ORGAN (\[nRZUSTKA))Thus the type /sort/ ORGAN may be re-garded as a predicate and the aboveatomic formula as true one.B.
The amplifier is a part representingthe "fundamental" knowledge of thesystem.
The formulae included in theamplifier can be devided into three cat-egories:I/ dependent formulae/i/Vx~ ~s~..VXnCS~ A~x~,.. ,x~,Ixf=~A is here any formula and n a predi-cate.

Diagram of the data basesystem /Konrad 76/Recapitulating, the nucleus repre-sents the extensional part of the know-ledge represented in the data base.
Itis the fundamental knowledge which can-not be obtained from the amalysis of thepresented text, and which is assentialto proper deduction.
The amplifierrepresents the intensional part of thedata base.
The knowledge representedthere is a co31ection of statements usedfor deduction.Each of the logical formulae iskept in a certain internal form, corre-sponding to the way of deduction, de-scribed later on.
As we have alreadymentioned, the majority of formulae isof the /i/ form.
Every such formula isconverted, at the moment of insertinginto the data base, to a pair of thefollowing form:(~conclusion~premises testing procedure)3.2.
The knowled6e extractionBecause of the menner of storingthe knowledge described in the point 3.1,the answer to the question presented tothe system does not have to be represent-ed explicite in the data base.
The de-duction module should be able to obtainall the information included in the database.The questions presented to the sys-tem are also converted to the logicalformulae.
Thus, the extraction of knowl-edge is reduced to the verification ofa given formula towards the present con-tent of the data base.The logical formula representingthe question is converted to an appro-priate LISP form.
Evaluation of sucha form is equivalent to examinationwhether the represented by it formula istrue.
This form correspond to the normalform of the logical formula /LISP func-tion AND, OR and NOT are used/.
Theliterals are tested by a TESTE functionaccording to the following algorithm:I.
Check the amplifier, trying to findthe rule with the conclusion unifi-able with the literal under proof.
Ifsuch a formula does not exist that thereis no proof of a given literal;2.
If there is such a formula then:a. if it is indicated as an indepen-dent formula then STOP with a proofb.
if it is indicated as a restrictiveformula then STOP without a proof~c.
otherwise evaluate the form asso-ciated with the conclusion; if weobtain NIT, /false in LISP/ thensearch the amplifier for anotherrule and go to 2.
If we obtainvalue different than NIL then STOP200Iwith a proof.Otherwise Stop without a nroof.It is therefore a so called backwarddeduction zystem.
The nroof goes backfrom the formula - aim ~ to the facts,applying the formulae from the amplifierin the "Backward" direction.The answer can be YES or NO or itcan be a list of constants depending onthe kind of question.The I order logic has been enrichedhere with some elements of the II orderlanguage.
Predicate variables, quantifi-cation of these variavles and retrievalof predicates as well as constants havebeen introduced.3.3.
Access to the data baseThe system communicates  with thedata base through commands of the spe-cially designed language.
These commandsenable introduction and erasing from thedata base.The basic commands serving the pur-pose of knowledge extraction are TESTand FIND:a.
TEST A- looking for the proof of a formulaA.
Answer YES/NO.b.
FIND ~1""11 'mX~xl" 'xn)  ~r~1"';x1" '~~ i  - predicate variables- retrieval of all the pairs: m-tuplepredicates and n-tuple oe constantswhich satisfy a given formula A.3.4.
ExampleThe formula presented in theexample I and a formula below have beenintroduced into the amlifier.Sentence:Wzrost napi@cia mi~dni6wki d~mnastnicymo~e by4 przyczyn~ OZT./The rise of the tonicity of theduodenum muscular coat may be thereason of acute pancreatitis/Formula:(IMPLSYM(VAC x84 ~oc))~,~LS~DW~ASTNIOA~,((~ART-OF-OROAN ~)(~Y xe~)XgO r IESHIO   A)(ORC N X88))L@szcm~;ss 4) (szc~ ?s6) (S~E X91FIZJ) (S~A~, X92~APIECIE) \[~0~\[ ~S7)))(@ OROAN 2\] (ORGAN X94) (O~Tm~ X95TRZUS~KA);\[(# ~:~/DZ-NARZAD I) (ORGAN X94)((~ SICKNESS 4) (SICK X95) (STYPE X96PATO) (SNA~:E X97 OZT)(BODY X94)))((II~$PLY 3)(INFER X85\] ~TIO X85)(SIC~<~TESS X95)))Formula corresponding to the question ispresented in the Example 2.
The ampli-fier contains the formula describingtransitivity of the predicate I~LY .Facts - ground literals - wereintroduced into the nucleus.
E.g.

The answer is of course YES.4.
ConclusionThe results obtained during thework on the system confirmed our direc-tion of research.
Our further work willconcentrate on constant improvement ofthe existing modules.
At the sere timewe will undertake attempts of enrichingthe system with better deductive modulessuch as resolution in modal logic,default reasoning /Relter/, FUZZY andMinsky frames.ACKNO~WLEDGEMENTSThe medical text was prepared bya team of physicians from the Post-graduate Education Center in Warsawunder the leadership of Prof. DrJ.Doroszewski.
