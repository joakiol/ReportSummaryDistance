In addition, wordformlexicons for each of the languages weredeveloped.
The corpus includes a parallelcomponent consisting of Orwell's NineteenEighty-Four, with versions in all six languagestagged for part-of-speech and aligned to English(also tagged for POS).
We describe the encodingformat and data architecture d signed especiallyfor this corpus, which is generally usable forencoding linguistic orpora.
We also describe themethodology for the development of aharmonized set of morphosyntactic descriptions(MSDs), which builds upon the scheme forwestern European languages developed withinthe EAGLES project.
We discuss the specialconcerns for handling the six project languages,which cover three distinct language families.Introduct ionIn order to provide resources to enable theefficient extraction of quantitative andqualitative information from corpora, severalcorpus development and distribution efforts havebeen recently established.
However, few corporaexist for Central and Eastern European (CEE)languages, and corpus-processing tools that takeinto account he specific characteristics of theselanguages are virtually non-existent.The Multext-East Copernicus projec0 (Erjavec,et al, 1997) was a spin-off of the LRE projectMultext 2(Ide and Vtronis, 1994) intended to fillthese gaps by developing significant resourcesfor six CEE languages (Bulgarian, Czech,Estonian, Hungarian, Romanian, Slovene) thatfollow a consistent and principled encodingformat and are maximally suited to easyprocessing by corpus-handling tools.
To thisend, Multext-East developed a corpus of paralleland comparable texts for the six CEE projectlanguages, together with wordform lexicons andother language-specific resources.
In thefollowing sections we briefly describe theMultext-East corpora (text, speech) and theMultext-East lexicons and language-specificresources.1 The Multext-East corpora1.1 Encoding formatBased on the principle that its corpus encodingformat should be standardized and homogeneousboth for interchange and for facilitating open-ended retrieval tasks, Multext-East adopted thelhttp://nl.ijs.si/ME2http://www.
lpl.univ-aix.fr/projects/Multext/315Corpus Encoding Standard (CES) 3 (Ide, 1998),which has been developed to be optimally suitedfor use in language engineering and corpus-based work.
The CES is an application of SGML(ISO-8879, Standard Generalized MarkupLanguage) and is based on the TEl Guidelinesfor Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange.In addition to providing encoding conventionsfor elements relevant to corpus-based work, theCES provides a data architecture for linguisticcorpora and their annotations.
Each corpuscomponent, comprising a single text and itsannotations, is organized as a hyper-document,with various levels of annotation stored inseparate SGML documents (each with a separateDTD).
Low-density (i.e., above the token level)annotation is expressed indirectly in terms ofinter-document links.
Markup for different typesof annotation (e.g., part of speech, alignment,etc.)
is described by a separate Data TypeDefinition (DTD) specifically tailored to thatinformation.1.2 The parallel corpusThe Multext-East parallel corpus consists ofseven translations of George Orwell's NineteenEighty-Four: besides the original Englishversion, the corpus contains translations in thesix project languages.
There are three versionsof each text in the parallel corpus, correspondingto different levels of annotation: a cesDocencoding (SGML markup up to the sub-paragraph level, including markup for sentenceboundaries); and a cesAna encoding, containingword-level morphosyntactic markup togetherwith links to each sentence (and in someversions, to each word) in the cesDoc version.
Afourth document, the cesAlign document, isassociated with each of the non-Englishversions, which includes links betweensentences in the cesDoc encoding for each andthe English version, thus providing a parallelalignment at the sentence level.
The cesAnaversions, which are the most linguistically3 The CES was developed in a joint effort of theEuropean projects Multext (LRE) and EAGLES (inparticular, the EAGLES Text Representationsubgroup), together with the Vassar/CNRScollaboration (supported by the U.S. NationalScience Foundation).informative, are marked up as shown below forthe English phrase "smell of bugs":<tok type=WORD from=' Oen.

All possiblemorphosyntactic interpretations of the token aregiven in the <lox> field consisting of the baseform, a morphosyntactic description (see Section2), and an associated corpus tag.
The <disamb>field contains the interpretation that has beenidentified as valid within the respective context;within this tag, the <eeag> element provides thecorresponding corpus tag (see section 2).

In this table:?
tok  = number of tokens?
words  = number of lexical items (excludingpunctuation)?
lex  = number of MSD-based interpretationsof the words in the text?
MSD/amb = average ratio of the number oflexical variants per wordThe texts from the corpora were segmentedusing the corpus annotation toolset developedwithin the Multext project, augmented bylanguage-specific resources developed byMultext-East.
The Multext segmenter is alanguage-independent and configurabletokenizer whose output includes token,paragraph and sentence boundary markers.Punctuation, lexical items, numbers, and variousalphanumeric sequences (such as dates andhours) are annotated with tags defined in ahierarchical, class-structured tagset.
Thelanguage-specific behavior of the segmenter isenabled by its engine-driven design, in which alllanguage-specific information is provided asdata.
Within Multext-East, resource data,including rules describing the form of sentenceboundaries, word splitting (cliticized formsdecomposition), word compounding, quotations,numbers, dates, punctuation, capitalization,abbreviations etc., was developed for the sixproject languages.Once the input text was tokenized, a dictionarylook-up procedure was used to assign eachlexical token all its possible morphosyntacticdescriptors (MSDs).
The ambiguously MSD-annotated texts were then hand-disambiguated(entirely for some languages and partially for theothers).
This time-consuming and error-proneprocess was sped up significantly by a specialXEMACS mode, developed within the project,which is aware of the morphosyntacticdescriptors' ignificance and allows for naturallanguage xpansion of the linear encoding of theMSDs.
The ambiguously MSD-annotated textsand the corresponding disambiguated textsprovided the basis for building the cesAnaencoded version of the multilingual parallelcorpus.The corpus also contains ix language pair-wisealignments between each of the six projectlanguages and English.
The alignments wereperformed by three different automatic aligners(Multext-aligner, "vanilla-aligner", Silfide-aligner) with accuracy ranging between 75-90%,and then hand validated.
Table 2 shows thedistribution of sentence alignments for each pairof languages.1.3 Multilingual comparable corpusMultext-East also produced a multilingualcomparab le  corpus, including two subsets of atleast 100,000 words each for each of the sixproject languages.
The texts include fiction,comprising a single novel or excerpts fromseveral novels, and newspaper data.The data is comparable across the six languages,in terms of the number and size of texts.
Theentire multilingual comparable corpus wasprepared in CES format manually or using adhoc tools.LanguagetokensB~sarian101173Czech English118102Estonian Hungarian98426Romanian Slovene100358 94906 118063 107769words 86020 79862 103997 75433 80705 101508 90792lex 156002 214368 214404 147542 111945 189695 187562VISD/amb 1.81 2.68 2.06 1.96 1.39 1.87 2.07distinct 16348 19115 9745 17870 20316 15225 17861wordsdistinct 8517 9161 7260 8873 10387 7433 7916lemmasTable 1: Corpus characteristics317Flnno-Ugric LanguagesEstonian-EnglishAlign Nr.

tocover the six Multext-East languages (Erjavecand Monachini, 1997).
Accommodating thedifferent language families represented amongthe Multext-East languages demandedsubstantial ssessment and modification of thepre-existing specifications, which wereoriginally developed for western Europeanlanguages only.For corpus morpho-lexical processing purposes,the Multext-East consortium developedlanguage-specific wordform dictionaries, which,for all languages except Estonian andHungarian, contain the full inflectional paradigmfor at least the lemmas appearing in the corpus.Each dictionary entry has the followingstructure:wordform \[TAB\] 1emma \[TAB\] MSD \[TAB\]where wordform represents an inflected form ofthe lemma, characterised by a combination offeature values encoded by a MorphosyntacticDescription (MSD).
The Multext-East lexiconsand MSDs are fully described in Tufts, Ide, andErjavec (1998).A general overview of the lexicons is shown inTable 3.
The Entries column provides thenumber of dictionary entries, that is, triplets:<wordform lemma MSD>.
The Wordformscolumn gives the number of distinct wordformsappearing in the lexicon, irrespective of theirlemma nd MSD.
The Lemma column gives thenumber of distinct lemmas in the lexicon,eliminating duplications that appear due tolemma homography.
The difference between theLemma and "=" fields provides an estimate ofthe number of homographic lemmas.
The MSDfield gives the total number of distinct MSDsused in the encoding of the lexicon stock.The last two columns in Table 3 (AMB_POSand AMB_MSD) provide information about henumber of ambiguity classification clusters.
Anambiguity classification cluster provides thenumber of ways a homographic wordform canbe classified.
AMB_POS ("part of speechambiguity") and AMB_MSD ("MSD-ambiguity") provide the classification based onthe part of speech and MSD, respectively.
Thenumber of ambiguity classes (based either onPOS or MSD) is a key figure in estimating thespace needed to construct a statistical language318model (such as HMM) useful formorphosyntactic disambiguation.
This numberwas a key factor in the tagset design.For several of the project languages and forEnglish, a set of corpus tags has also beendeveloped which are appropriate for use withstochastic disambiguators.
Where corpus tagshave been developed, mapping rules from MSDsto corpus tags (n-to-1 mapping) are alsoprovided as a resource.Language Entries Wordforms Lemmas = MSD AmbPOS AmbMSDEnglish 66469 43455 22571 25813 132 47 248Romanian 440363 347960 33259 35421 674 90 981Slovene 539213 191728 15671 15863 2044 48 1185Czech 133803 41601 14458 14684 915 35 698Bulgarian 333779 284211 18864 19071 185 42 400Estonian 130409 89180 22054 23384 563 63 101259614 46886 15838 17380 603 62 890 Hungarian\['able 3: Multilingual Lexicon OverviewConclusionThe multilingual resources (lexicons, rules,corpora) developed in Multext-East are amongof the most comprehensive r sources currentlyavailable for most of the project languages.
