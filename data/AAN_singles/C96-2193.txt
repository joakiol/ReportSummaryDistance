jpFumihiro AOYAMAObirin University3758 Tok iwa-ch5  Mach ida-sh i ,  Tokyo  194-02, JAPANAbst ractWe have constructed the IPA Lexiconof Basic Japanese Nouns (IPAL-BN),which has a hierarchical structure basedon the syntactic and semantic proper-ties of no,ms.
In our lexicon, each lex-ical entry consists of subentries, andsubentries have semantic property in-formation.
Among these elements, wefocus here on the subentry description.Conventional Japanese dictionaries onlyenmnerate various usages.
But it is alsoimportant o clarify the semantic rela-tions between subentries.
Thus we havedeveloped a method for specifying thekind of relationship between subentries,using special cognitiw~ devices such asmetaphor, metonymy, and synecdoche.After a brief review of the structure ofour lexicon, we discuss how the nlethodcan be applied to the lexical descrip-tion.1 I n t roduct ionTile Information-technology Promotion Agency(IPA) i has compiled the IPA Lexicon ofthe Japanese Language for Computers, BasicJapanese Verbs (IPAL-BV) (1987) and BasicJapanese Adjectives (IPAL-BA) (1990).
TheIPAL-BV contains 861 verbs and the IPAL-BAcontains 136 adjectives a~s lexical entries.
Theselexicons are available for public use and have beenwidely used in various mfiversity and research in-stitute projects that have yielded encouraging re-sults.
We started work on the IPAL-BN projectin 1990. hi May 1996, we released tlie third edi-tion of tile IPAL-BN, with 1,081 nouns as lexicalentries, for the public on networks with FTP  ser-vice.The IPAL project is characterized by its linguis-tic basis.
For example, the hierarchical structurei A special juridical body under the jurisdictionof the Ministry of International Tradc and Industry,Japmt.of the IPAL-BN, which consists of lexical entries,subentries, and semantic property information, re-flects our linguistic considerations concerning thesyntactic and semantic properties of nouns.
An-other example of benefits fi'om our linguisticallyinspired approach is the description of the kind ofrelationship between subentries.
Such informationwould be useful in various applications, but is notyet explicitly provided in existing Japanese dictio-naries.
In the following sections, we first brieflyintroduce the general structure of the IPAL-BN,and then describe our method for specifying thekind of relationship between subentries.
In theconcluding renlarks, we also touch on implicationsof the nlethod for tile application systems.2 St ructure  of  IPAL -BNFigure 1 shows the top-level structure of theIPAL-BN.
The H'AL-BN consists of 1,081 lexicalentries.I PAL -BNFigure 1: Basic Structure of IPAL-BNEach lexical entry is conlposed of orthographicinformation, idiomatic information, and suben-tries.
Tile idiomatic in\]ormation accommodatesthe idiomatic or proverbial uses of the noun thathave to be treated separately.
Let us take an ex-ample, Hanako-wa hana-ga takai.
This Japanesesentence has the idiomatic meaning, "Hanako isproud," in addition to the ordinary nleaning,"Hanako has a long nose."
hi the idionlatic cases,the meaning of tile whole sentence cannot be de-composed into the meaning of each word.
Thus wereserve the idiomatic information separately fi'om1082ordinary meaning sections.Then we introduce a hierarchy, subdividingeach entry that has more than one usage of theword.
Each usage is (:ailed a subentry.
The subdi-vision to subentry is based not only on semanticbut also on syntactic haracteristics.
This catego-rization process can be ilhtstrated with an exam-pie of hankyo 'echo':hant:y5 q~('he'01.
a somM t,hat is reflected off a surface such as tit(:wall of a lmilding.Bbru-no oto-ga hcya-no natca-de hankyS-suru.
(The sound of the ball echoes in the room.)02.
one's (,xpr(:ssion of an opinion about or at.tit.mh:toward som('thing.Kon, o hanashi-wa hitobito-uo kokoro-ni hwnky5-o yobiokosu darS.
(This story will arouse an echo in every man'sheart)One may note that hanky&O1 has a usage inwhich a noun t)ecomes a verb when followed by"-suru", while hanky&02 does not.
On the basisof tlfis (lifference, we divide this i20,112 into thesetwo subentries.Figure 2 giw.
's an overview of each subc, ntry.A subentry consists of subentry information andseveral pieces of semantic property information.The subentry information contains syntaeti(:, se-mantic, and morphoh)gical information co,ninonto all parts of the subentry (each selnantie prop-erty ilfforlnation section).
The semantic t)ropertyinformation in(hides syntactic and semantic in-formation.
In the case of hanky5, we use the syn-tactic information in the subentry information todescribe, tim difference in the usages (Kuwahata,1995).Subentry----I Subentry information \]s .... tic intormatk,~ ) (b)Mo,~,,o,o0,~,,,,fo,~ ) (c)ic property information /~Syn ac  ic o ma ion  .

\[,'or example, 'the letter' in ' I  read theletter' focuses oi1 tim information in the letter,whereas its counterpart in ' I  l>urned the letter' fo-cuses on the thing (i.e., piece of paper) bearingthat information.
Since we can say 'I burned theletter that I had read', the word ' letter' does nothave two meanings but rather has two aspects.Tiros a noun is consi<lere<l here to have variousaspects depending on the predicates used in thesentence containing the noun.
These aspects arecalled semantic properties (Aoyama, 1995).
In-stead of subdividing the lexical entry into multiplesubentries, we categorized the regular collocationsin each subentry in terms of semantic properties.For exan2ple, let, us take the word ha ' tooth/ teeth '  which has three semantic t)rot)erties.
Inour notation, the semantic properties are labeledby three letters in square brackets.
The phrasesha-o migaku 'l)rush one's teeth' and ha-o nuku'pull one's tooth'  refer to tooth as a concrete ob-ject \[CON\].
And the phrases ha-ga haern 'cutteetlf  and ha-ga nukeru 'h)se teeth' imply (nat-ural) phenomena \[PHE\], while the t)hrases ha-gajobu-da 'tlave sound teetlF and ha-ga guragura-suru 'a tooth feels h)ose' single out a condition ofteeth from their potential conditions \[POT\].3 Relationships of Subentries3.1 P rob lemMost, existing Japanese dictionaries merely enu-merate various usages.
But clarifying the seman-tic relations between those usages is important.For exan2ple, the noun tamago 'egg/spawn' hasthree senses:tanuulo 'egg/spawn'01.
a I l  o l ) jec~ covered wit, It a hard shell or a mem-brane, produced by a female animal.Kingffo-ga tarnago-o urtda.
(The gohlfish spawm:d.)02. a heat's egg (i.e., some kind of food).Hana~:o-wa t mago-o ichi pa~:ku katta.
(tlanako bought 1 dozen eggs.)03.
at person ~tt the Imginning of his/her carter.Hanal~o-wa isha-no tam, a.qo-da.
(Hanako is a dot:for lit the inaking.
)A hen's egg (02) ix one type of object thatix covered wittl a hard shell (01), and (03) is ametaphor with respect to the relation betweenhen's egg (02) and hen.
Our problem was to ex-plicidy (lescribe these kinds of relations betweenmeanings.3.2 ApproachIll the literat, ure, several attempts \]lave al-ready been made to analyze such senlantierelationships 2.
Yanlanasld (1995), among others,1)oints out that apt)re(taring such special cogni-tive devices as metaphor and metonymy is the2Ulhnann, 1969; Lakoff and Johrlson, 1980; Kuni-hire, 1982; Yamanashi, 1995.1083key to understanding polysemy.
We emt)loy thismethod for sI)ecifying the kind of relationship l)e-tween subentries.
Currently we note three typesof relations:?
Metaphor ,  based  on  s imi la r i t ies?
Metonymy,  based on various (:ontiguitics?
Synecdoche,  l)ase.d oil the relation betweenm(mtl)er mM (:~0;(:goryMetaphor  is the similm-ity-based instrumentfor exte,Ming the meaning of words.
At the out-set met, al)horical expressions are temporarily usedfigures of speech.
However, some metaphors conmto be fixed and pass into everyday use.
Let us takesome examples: h.on-no mushi 'a worm of books'(a person who is crazy about reading), arasofno tane 'a seed of argument'  (a cause for argu-ment), and kotoba-no kabe 'a wall of words' (alanguage barrier).
We regard these ext)ressions asflfll-fledged usages of dm nouns, and accordinglydescrihe them in the IPAL-BN, while telnporalusages are not considered fl)r description in ourlexicon.Metonyn ly  is an instrument for employing aword to refer to something that distinct front, hut,is associated in some way with, the original ref-erent of the.
word.
Tyi)ieal examples are Nabe-gaoishi, "The dish is nice;" and Ano kyateh&wa (kata-o shiteiru, "The catcher has nice shoulders(The catcher has a powerflfl throw)."
In the for-mer, the reference has shifted from the containerto the content, and in the latter, the refl~.rence hasshifted Dora the part of the body to its flmetion.Synecdoche  is the instrument hat take.s thename of a category to stand for one of its membersor taking the.
name of one ineml)er to stand for thewhole category, as shown in the above hen's eggexample: a hen's egg is one kind of object that iscovered with a hard shell.It is lint)or(ant not to confitse the colmoted re-latio,l of synecdoche with the contiguity relation\[part\]-\[whole\] of lltetollyttly.
Let 11s take all ('x-ample of the relation \[part\]-\[whole\] to show thedifference:te carln/hmtd'0l.
upl)cr limbs of a hmnan (th(: (mtire.ty, consistingof  ~r In  ~tiI(l hmtd).
"Ha.na~:o-wa ryShS-no te-o hirogcta.
"(Hmmko st)r(.
'~t(1 her arms.)02.
the (:ml of a person's arm (tit(: part consistingonly of the hand).
':Hanako-wa tc-o tataita.
"(Ilanako (:lal)I)('d her ttands.
)We do not consider the.
\[part\]-\[whole\] r lationhetween the arm (01) and t;he hand (02)to  be a l linstance of syne(:doehe.
Let us compare this ex-ample of te ' a rm/hand '  with the examph; of tam-ago 'egg.'
Besides a hen's egg, there are tmmyother sorts of eggs, such as a turtle's egg, a pi-geon's egg, mid a swallow's egg.
By contrast ofthe arln as a whole, only the hand receives thede.
',,}igiiation te.
For e.xamph'., we do not also ex-press the elbow as te ' a rm/hand. '
Hence.
we con-sider the contiguity relation \[part\]-\[whole\] to beone type of metonymy.
We distinguish it fi'om themember-category relation of synecdoche a.a .a  MethodIn this section, we will show sonm examples ofdescription.Some metaphorical expressions need some nlod-ifier and others do ttt)t.kata 'shoulder'01.
ftana~:o-wa kata-o sukumcta.
(Hanako shrugged her shouhh:rs.)02.
Sono uwagi-'no kata-wa 5l:\[.
(Thai; jacket has wide shoulders.)03.
Sono yam, a-no t:ata-ni yamagoya-ga ru.
(There is a lodge on that mountain shonhtcr.
)((}1) is a non-metaphorical use.
((}2) and (03)are metaphorical uses.
One may notice that, (02)can he used without y@zku-no 'of clothes', but((13) requires yama-no 'mountain-. '
We have theimpression that (02) is conventionalized.We.
classify metaphorical usages into two types:conventionalized and novel.
To the first group weassign expressions that can be used without be-ing modified.
Such an expression is indicated by"A = > B."
The second group is indicated by "A?
".> B."
These mean that A is original and Bin metaphorical.
We refer to the above relation,hence, as: "01 : :>  02.
01 " '>  03.
"It is hard to judge which is metaphor if bothSe l lSeS  &re  ( ;onve l l t io t la l .

Hana~:o-wa me-no mawari-ni shiwa-gadekite~:ita.
(Hanako has got wrinkles r(mnd her eyes.)02.
Hanako-wa shatsu-'no shiwa-o aitvn-denobashita.
(Hanako ironed out the wrinkles in her shirt.
)We regard (01) as non-metat)horical nd (02)as metaphorical firsl; group.Various contiguity relations cause metonymi-cal extension.
We single (),at, the relation \[part\]-\[whole\] as one.
group, and assign the other conti-guity relations to a second group.
The first groupis indicated by "A >> B" or "A << B" andthe second group is indicated by "a  \[X\] ->  \[Y\]B."
"A > > B" means extension h'om \[whole\] to\[part\] and "A < < B" lile.ans extension in the op-posite dire~cdon.
"A \[X\] - ->  \[Y\] B" me.ans thatthe relation \[X\]-\[Y\] links A to B.
These relationsinchlde \[eontainer\]-\[eontent\], \[inaterial\]-\[t)roduct\],\[,neans\]-\[act\].Here is an examl)le.aSato (1992) also dist, inguishes I)(:tw(,(m synec-doche and mctonymy.
