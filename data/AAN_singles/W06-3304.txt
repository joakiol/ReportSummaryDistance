So far, these approacheshave solely relied on the knowledge en-coded in the Gene Ontology and the geneannotations associated with the Gene On-tology database.
The goal of this paper isto demonstrate that improvements to theseapproaches can be obtained by integratingtextual evidence extracted from relevantbiomedical literature.1 IntroductionThe establishment of similarity between genes andgene products through homology searches has be-come an important discovery procedure that biolo-gists use to infer structural and functionalproperties of genes and gene products?see Changet al (2001) and references therein.
With the risinginfluence of the Gene Ontology1 (GO), new ap-proaches have emerged where the similarity be-tween genes or gene products is obtained bycomparing GO code annotations associated withthem.
The Gene Ontology provides three orthogo-nal networks of functional genomic concepts struc-1 http://www.geneontology.org.tured in terms of semantic relationships such asinheritance and meronymy, which encode biologi-cal process (BP), molecular function (MF) and cel-lular component (CC) properties of genes and geneproducts.
GO code annotations explicitly relategenes and gene products in terms of participationin the same/similar biological processes, presencein the same/similar cellular components and ex-pression of the same/similar molecular functions.Therefore, the use of GO code annotations in es-tablishing gene and gene product similarity pro-vides significant added functionality to methodssuch as BLAST (Altschul et al 1997) and FASTA(Pearson and Lipman 1988) where gene and geneproduct similarity is calculated using string-basedheuristics to select maximal segment pair align-ments across gene and gene product sequences toapproximate the Smith-Waterman algorithm(Smith and Waterman 1981).Three main GO-based approaches have emergedso far to compute gene and gene product similarity.One approach assesses GO code similarity in termsof shared hierarchical relations within each geneontology (BP, MF, or CC) (Lord et al 2002, 2003;Couto et al 2003; Azuaje et al 2005).
For exam-ple, the relative semantic closeness of two biologi-cal processes would be determined by theinformational specificity of the most immediateparent that the two biological processes share inthe BP ontology.
The second approach establishesGO code similarity by leveraging associative rela-tions across the three gene ontologies (Bodenreideret al 2005).
Such associative relations make pre-dictions such as which cellular component is mostlikely to be the location of a given biological proc-25ess and which molecular function is most likely tobe involved in a given biological process.
The thirdapproach computes GO code similarity by combin-ing hierarchical and associative relations (Posse etal.
2006).Several studies within the last few years(Andrade et al 1997, Andrade 1999, MacCallum etal.
2000, Chang at al.
2001) have shown that theinclusion of evidence from relevant scientific lit-erature improves homology search.
It is thereforehighly plausible that literature evidence can alsohelp improve GO-based approaches to gene andgene product similarity.
Sanfilippo et al (2004)propose a method for integrating literature evi-dence within an early version of the GO-basedsimilarity algorithm presented in Posse et al(2006).
However, no effort has been made so far inevaluating the potential contribution of textual evi-dence extracted from relevant biomedical literaturefor GO-based approaches to the computation ofgene and gene product similarity.
The goal of thispaper is to address this gap with specific referenceto the assessment of protein similarity.2 BackgroundGO-based similarity methods that focus on meas-uring intra-ontological relations have adopted theinformation theoretic treatment of semantic simi-larity developed in Natural Language Process-ing?see Budanitsky (1999) for an extensivesurvey.
An example of such a treatment is given byResnik (1995), who defines semantic similaritybetween two concept nodes c1 c2 in a graph as theinformation content of the least common su-perordinate (lcs) of c1 and c2, as shown in (1).
Theinformation content of a concept node c, IC(c), iscomputed as -log p(c) where p(c) indicates theprobability of encountering instances of c in a spe-cific corpus.
(1))),c p(lcs(c)),c IC(lcs(c) ,csim(c21log2121?===Jiang and Conrath (1997) provide a refinement ofResnik?s measure by factoring in the distance fromeach concept to the least common superordinate, asshown in (2).22 Jiang and Conrath (1997) actually define the distance be-tween two concepts nodes c1 c2, e.g.
)), c IC(lcs(c ) -  IC(c)  IC(c) , cdist(c 2122121 ?+=(2))),cIC(lcs(c) -IC(c)IC(c ) ,csim(c 21221121 ?+=Lin (1998) provides a slight variant of Jiang?s andConrath?s measure, as indicated in (3).
(3))  IC(c) IC(c)), c IC(lcs(c) ,csim(c2121221 +?=The information theoretic approach is very wellsuited to assess GO code similarity since each genesubontology is formalized as a directed acyclicgraph.
In addition, the GO database3 includes nu-merous curated GO annotations which can be usedto calculate the information content of each GOcode with high reliability.
Evaluations of thismethodology have yielded promising results.
Forexample, Lord et al (2002, 2003) demonstrate thatthere is strong correlation between GO-based simi-larity judgments for human proteins and similarityjudgments obtained through BLAST searches forthe same proteins.
Azuaje et al (2005) show thatthere is a strong connection between the degree ofGO-based similarity and the expression correlationof gene products.As Bodenreider et al (2005) remark, the mainproblem with the information theoretic approach toGO code similarity is that it does not take into ac-count associative relations across the gene ontolo-gies.
For example, the two GO codes 0050909(sensory perception of taste) and 0008527 (tastereceptor activity) belong to different gene ontolo-gies (BP and MF), but they are undeniably veryclosely related.
The information theoretic approachwould simply miss associations of this kind as it isnot designed to capture inter-ontological relations.Bodenreider et al (2005) propose to recover as-sociative relations across the gene ontologies usinga variety of statistical techniques which estimatethe similarity of two GO codes inter-ontologicallyin terms of the distribution of the gene product an-notations associated with the two GO codes in theGO database.
One such technique is an adaptationof the vector space model frequently used in In-formation Retrieval (Salton et al 1975), whereFor ease of exposition, we have converted Jiang?s and Con-rath?s semantic distance measure to semantic similarity bytaking its inverse, following Pedersen et al (2005).3 http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database.26each GO code is represented as a vector of gene-based features weighted according to their distribu-tion in the GO annotation database, and the simi-larity between two GO codes is computed as thecosine of the vectors for the two codes.The ability to measure associative relationsacross the gene ontologies can significantly aug-ment the functionality of the information theoreticapproach so as to provide a more comprehensiveassessment of gene and gene product similarity.However, in spite of their complementarities, thetwo GO code similarity measures are not easilyintegrated.
This is because the two measures areobtained through different methods, express dis-tinct senses of similarity (i.e.
intra- and inter-ontological) and are thus incomparable.Posse et al (2006) develop a GO-based similar-ity algorithm?XOA, short for Cross-OntologicalAnalytics?capable of combining intra- and inter-ontological relations by ?translating?
each associa-tive relation across the gene ontologies into a hier-archical relation within a single ontology.
Moreprecisely, let c1 denote a GO code in the gene on-tology O1 and c2 a GO code in the gene ontologyO2.
The XOA similarity between c1 and c2 is de-fined as shown in (4), where4?
cos(ci,cj) denotes the cosine associative meas-ure proposed by Bodenreider et al (2005)?
sim(ci,cj) denotes any of the three intra-ontological semantic similarities describedabove, see (1)-(3)?
maxci in Oj {f(ci)} denotes the maximum of thefunction f() over all GO codes ci in the geneontology Oj.The major innovation of the XOA approach is toallow the comparison of two nodes c1, c2 acrossdistinct ontologies O1, O2 by mapping c1 into itsclosest node c4 in O2 and c2 into its closest nodec3 in O1.
The inter-ontological semantic similaritybetween c1 and c2 can be then estimated from theintra-ontological semantic similarities between c1-4 If c1 and c2 are in the same ontology, i.e.
O1=O2, thenxoa(c1,c2) is still computed as in (4).
In most cases, themaximum in (4) would be obtained with c3 = c2 and c4 = c1so that  XOA(c1,c2) would simply be computed as sim(c1,c2).However, there are situations where there exists a GO code c3(c4) in the same ontology which?
is highly associated with c1 (c2),?
is semantically close to c2 (c1), and?
leads to a value for  sim(c1,c3) x cos(c2,c3)  ((sim(c2,c4)x cos(c1,c4)) that is higher than sim(c1,c2).c3 and c2-c4, using multiplication with the associa-tive relations between c2-c3 and c1-c4 as a scoreenrichment device.(4)???????????????????????????????????????
?=), c(c), c(c), c(c), c(cOincOinc,), c(c41cos42sim32cos31simXOA2413maxmaxmax21Posse et al (2006) show that the XOA similaritymeasure provides substantial advantages.
For ex-ample, a comparative evaluation of protein similar-ity, following the benchmark study of Lord et al(2002, 2003), reveals that XOA provides the basisfor a better correlation with protein sequence simi-larities as measured by BLAST bit score than anyintra-ontological semantic similarity measure.
TheXOA similarity between genes/gene products de-rives from the XOA similarity between GO codes.Let GP1 and GP2 be two genes/gene products.
Letc11,c12,?, c1n denote the set of GO codes associ-ated with GP1 and c21, c22,?., c2m the set of GOcodes associated with GP2.
The XOA similaritybetween GP1 and GP2 is defined as in (5), wherei=1,?,n and j=1,?,m.
(5) XOA(GP1,GP2) = max {XOA(c1i, c2j)}The results of the study by Posse et al (2006) areshown in Table 1.
Note that the correlation be-tween protein similarities based on intra-ontological similarity measures and BLAST bitscores in Table 1 is given for each choice of geneontology (MF, BP, CC).
This is because intra-ontological similarity methods only take into ac-count GO codes that are in the same ontology andcan therefore only assess protein similarity from asingle ontology viewpoint.
By contrast, the XOA-based protein similarity measure makes use of GOcodes that can belong to any of the three gene on-tologies and needs not be broken down by singleontologies, although the contribution of each geneontology or even single GO codes can still befleshed out, if so desired.Is it possible to improve on these XOA resultsby factoring in textual evidence?
We will addressthis question in the remaining part of the paper.27Semantic SimilarityMeasuresResnik Lin Jiang &ConrathIntra-ontologicalMolecular Function 0.307 0.301 0.296Biological Process 0.195 0.202 0.203Cellular Component 0.229 0.234 0.233XOA 0.405 0.393 0.368Table 1: Spearman rank order correlation coeffi-cients between BLAST bit score and semanticsimilarities, calculated using a set of 255,502 pro-tein pairs?adapted from Posse et al (2006).3 Textual Evidence SelectionOur first step in integrating textual evidence intothe XOA algorithm is to select salient informationfrom biomedical literature germane to the problem.Several approaches can be used to carry out thisprerequisite.
For example, one possibility is to col-lect documents relevant to the task at hand, e.g.through PubMed queries, and use feature weight-ing and selection techniques from the InformationRetrieval literature?e.g.
tf*idf (Buckley 1985) andInformation Gain (e.g.
Yang and Pedersen1997)?to distill the most relevant information.
An-other possibility is to use Information Extractionalgorithms tailored to the biomedical domain suchas Medstract (http://www.medstract.org, Puste-jovsky et al 2002) to extract entity-relationshipstructures of relevance.
Yet another possibility is touse specialized tools such as GoPubMed (Domsand Schroeder 2005) where traditional keyword-based capabilities are coupled with term extractionand ontological annotation techniques.In our study, we opted for the latter solution, us-ing generic Information Retrieval techniques tonormalize and weigh the textual evidence ex-tracted.
The main advantage of this choice is thattools such as GoPubMed provide very high qualityterm extraction at no cost.
Less appealing is thefact that the textual evidence provided is GO-basedand therefore does not offer information which isorthogonal to the gene ontology.
It is reasonable toexpect better results than those reported in this pa-per if more GO-independent textual evidence werebrought to bear.
We are currently working on usingMedstract as a source of additional textual evi-dence.GoPubMed is a web server which allows usersto explore PubMed search results using the GeneOntology for categorization and navigation pur-poses (available at http://www.gopubmed.org).
Asshown in Figure 1 below, the system offers thefollowing functionality:?
It provides an overview of PubMed search re-sults by categorizing abstracts according to theGene Ontology?
It verifies its classification by providing anaccuracy percentage for each?
It shows definitions of Gene Ontology terms?
It allows users to navigate PubMed search re-sults by GO categories?
It automatically shows GO terms related to theoriginal query for each result?
It shows query terms (e.g.
?Rab5?
in the mid-dle windowpane of Figure 1)?
It automatically extracts terms from searchresults which map to GO categories (e.g.
high-lighted terms other than ?Rab5?
in the middlewindowpane of Figure 1).In integrating textual evidence with the XOA al-gorithm, we utilized the last functionality (auto-matic extraction of terms) as an InformationExtraction capability.
Details about the term ex-traction algorithm used in GoPubMed are given inDelfs et al (2004).
In short, the GoPubMed termextraction algorithm uses word alignment strate-gies in combination with stemming to match wordsequences from PubMed abstracts with GO terms.In doing so, partial and discontinuous matches areallowed.
Partial and discontinuous matches areweighted according to closeness of fit.
This is indi-cated by the accuracy percentages associated withGO in Figure 1 (right side).
In this study we didnot make use of these accuracy percentages, butplan to do so in the future.28Figure 1: GoPubMed sample query for the ?rab5?
protein.
The abstracts shown are automatically proposed by thesystem after the user issues the protein query and then selects the GO term ?late endosome?
(bottom left) as thediscriminating parameter.Our data set consists of 2360 human proteinpairs containing 1783 distinct human proteins.
Thisdata set was obtained as a 1% random sample ofthe human proteins used in the benchmark study ofPosse et al (2006)?see Table 1.5 For each of the1783 human proteins, we made a GoPubMed queryand retrieved up to 100 abstracts.
We then col-lected all the terms extracted by GoPubMed foreach protein across the abstracts retrieved.
Table 2provides an example of the output of this process.nutrient, uptake, carbohydrate, metabolism, affect-ing, cathepsin, activity, protein, lipid, growth, rate,habitually, signal, transduction, fat, protein, cad-herin, chromosomal, responses, exogenous, lactat-ing, exchanges, affects, mammary, gland, ?.Table 2: Sample output of the GoPubMed term extrac-tion process for the Cadherin-related tumor suppressorprotein.5 We chose such a small sample to facilitate the collection ofevidence from GoPubMed, which is not yet fully automated.Our XOA approach is very scalable, and we do not anticipateany problem running the full protein data set of 255,502 pairs,once we fully automate the GoPubMed extraction process.4 Integrating Textual Evidence in XOAUsing the output of the GoPubMed term extractionprocess, we created vector-based signatures foreach of the 1783 proteins, where?
features are obtained by stemming the termsprovided by GoPubMed?
the value for each feature is derived as thetf*idf  for the feature.We then calculated the similarity between each ofthe 2360 protein pairs as the cosine value of thetwo vector-based signatures associated with theprotein pair.We tried two different strategies to augment theXOA score for protein similarity using the proteinsimilarity values obtained as the cosine of theGoPubMed term-based signatures.
The first strat-egy adopts a fusion approach in which the twosimilarity measures are first normalized to becommensurable and then combined to provide aninterpretable integrated model.
A simple normali-zation is obtained by observing that the Resnik?sinformation content measure is commensurable to29the log of the text based cosine (LC).
This leads usto the fusion model shown in (5) for XOA, basedon Resnik?s semantic similarity measure (XOAR).
(5)      Fusion(Resnik) = XOAR + LCWe then observe that the XOA measures based onResnik, Lin (XOAL) and Jiang & Conrath (XOAJC)are highly correlated (correlations exceed 0.95 onthe large benchmarking dataset discussed in sec-tion 2, see Table 1).
This suggests the fusion modelshown in (6), where the averages of the XOAscores are computed from the benchmarking dataset.
(6)      Fusion(Lin) =XOAL + LC*Ave( XOAL)/Ave(XOAR)Fusion(Jiang & Conrath) =XOAJC + LC*Ave(XOAJC)/Ave(XOAR)The second strategy consists in building a predic-tion model for BLAST bit score (BBS) using theXOA score and the log-cosine LC as predictorswithout the constraint of remaining interpretable.As in the previous strategy, a different model wassought for each of the three XOA variants.
In eachcase, we restrict ourselves to cubic polynomial re-gression models as such models are quite efficientat capturing complex nonlinear relationships be-tween target and predictors (e.g.
Weisberg 2005).More precisely, for each of the semantic similaritymeasures, we fit the regression model to BBSshown in (7), where the subscript x denotes eitherR, L or JC, and the coefficients a to h are found bymaximizing the Spearman rank order correlationsbetween BBS and the regression model.
Thismaximization is automatically carried out by usinga random walk optimization approach (Romeijn1992).
The coefficients used in this study for eachsemantic similarity measure are shown in Table 3.

Note that the lattercorrelations are lower than the one reported in Ta-ble 2 due to the small size of our sample (1% of theoriginal data set, as pointed out above).

P-values for the differences between the augmented mod-els and XOA alone are given in parentheses.An important finding from Table 4 is that inte-grating text-based evidence in the semantic simi-larity measures systematically improves therelationships between BLAST and XOA.
Not sur-prisingly, the fusion models yield smaller im-provements.
However, these improvements in theorder of 3% for the Resnik and Lin variants arevery encouraging, even though they are not statis-tically significant.
The regression models, on theother hand, provide larger and statistically signifi-cant improvements, reinforcing our hypothesis thattextual evidence complements the GO-based simi-larity measures.
We expect that a more sophisti-cated NLP treatment of textual evidence will yieldsignificant improvements even for the more inter-pretable fusion models.Conclusions and Further WorkOur early results show that literature evidence pro-vides a significant contribution, even using verysimple Information Extraction and integrationmethods such as those described in this paper.
Theemployment of more sophisticated Information30Extraction tools and integration techniques istherefore likely to bring higher gains.Further work using GoPubMed involves factor-ing in the accuracy percentage which related ex-tracted terms to their induced GO categories andcapturing complex phrases (e.g.
signal transduc-tion, fat protein).
We also intend to compare theadvantages provided by the GoPubMed term ex-traction process with Information Extraction toolscreated for the biomedical domain such as Med-stract (Pustejovsky et al 2002), and develop amethodology for integrating a variety of Informa-tion Extraction processes into XOA.ReferencesAltschul, S.F., T.
