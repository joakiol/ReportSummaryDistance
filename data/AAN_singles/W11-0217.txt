Researchers want to know whentheir colleagues are proposing theories, out-lining evidentiary relations, or explaining dis-crepancies.
We show here that sentence-levelannotation with the CISP schema adapts wellto a corpus of biomedical articles, and wepresent preliminary results arguing that theCISP schema is uniquely suited to recoveringcommon types of scientific arguments abouthypotheses, explanations, and evidence.1 IntroductionIn the scientific domain, the deluge of full-textpublications is driving researchers to find bettertechniques for extracting or summarizing the mainclaims and findings in a paper.
Many researchershave noted that the sentences of a paper play a smallset of different rhetorical roles (Teufel and Moens,1999; Blais et al, 2007; Agarwal and Yu, 2009).
Weare investigating the rhetorical roles of sentences inthe CRAFT corpus, a set of 97 full-text papers thatwe have annotated using the CISP schema.
Handalignment of the resulting annotations suggests thatpatterns in these CISP-annotated sentences corre-spond to common argumentative gambits in scien-tific writing.2 MethodsThe CRAFT corpus is a set of 97 full-text papers de-scribing the function of genes in the Mouse GenomeInformatics database (Blake et al, 2011).
Thesedocuments have already been annotated with syn-tactic information (parse trees and part-of-speechtags), linguistic phenomena (coreference), and se-mantic entities (genes, chemicals, cell lines, biolog-ical functions and molecular processes), making thecorpus a rich resource for extracting or inferring in-formation from full scientific papers.The CISP schema (Soldatova and Liakata, 2007;Liakata et al, 2009) contains 11 categories, and sev-eral of the categories describe the intentions of theauthors, making it well suited for markup of argu-mentation.
We chose to narrow these down to 9 cat-egories (excluding Model and Object) during anno-tation training; our guidelines are shown in Figure1.
We expect this schema to describe the pragmat-ics in the text well, while still offering the poten-tial for high interannotator agreement due to a man-ageable number of categories.
The process of mark-ing the sentences in the CRAFT corpus according tothe CISP guidelines took one annotator about fourmonths.3 Results and DiscussionSix of the 97 CRAFT papers do not follow the stan-dard IMRaD paper structure (one was a review ar-ticle, and five combined Results and Discussion);these documents were eliminated from this analy-sis.
Annotation of the 91 remaining CRAFT papersresulted in 20676 sentences.
The distribution of theannotated classes is shown in Table 1.Our use of the CISP schema exposes an approachfor recovering two types of explanatory arguments.The first sets the context with a sequence of Back-134Figure 1: Flow chart for CISP annotation of the CRAFT corpus.CISP Type Count PercentageHypothesis 1050 5.08Goal 992 4.80Motivation 928 4.49Background 2838 13.73Method 637 3.08Experiment 5270 25.49Result 5471 26.46Observation 1168 5.65Conclusion 2322 11.23Total 20676 100.0Table 1: Distribution of CISP sentence types annotated in91 CRAFT articles.ground sentences, followed by a Hypothesis, Moti-vation, or Goal; this echoes a motif found by Swales(1990) and Teufel and Moens (1999).
