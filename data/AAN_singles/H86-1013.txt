COMMONSENSE METAPHYSICSAND LEX ICAL  SEMANTICSJerry R. Hobbs, William Croft, Todd Davies,Douglas Edwards, and Kenneth LawsArtificial Intell igence CenterSR I  Internat iona l1 In t roduct ionIn the TACITUS project for using commonsense knowl-edge in the understanding of texts ?bout mechanical de-vices and their failures, we have been developing variouscommonsense theories that are needed to mediate betweenthe way we talk about the behavior of such devices andcausal models of their operation.
Of central importance inthis effort is the axiomatization of what might be called"commonsense metaphysics'.
This includes a number ofareas that figure in virtually every domain of discourse,such as scalar notions, granularity, time, space, material,physical objects, causality, functionality, force, and shape.Our approach to lexical semantics i then to construct coretheories of each of these areas, and then to define, or atleast characterize, ?
large number of lexical items in termsprovided by the core theories.
In the TACITUS system,processes for solving pragrnatics problems posed by ?
textwill use the knowledge base consisting of these theories inconjunction with the logical forms of the sentences in thetext to produce an interpretation.
In this paper we donot stress these interpretation processes; this is another,important aspect of the TACITUS project, and it will bedescribed in subsequent papers.This work represents a convergence of research in lexicalsemantics in linguistics and efforts in AI to encode com-monsense knowledge.
Lexical semanticist* over the yearshave developed formalisms of increasing adequacy for en-coding word meaning, progressing from simple sets of fea-tures (Katz and Fodor, 1963) to notations for predicate-argument structure (Lakoff, 1972; Miller and Johnson-Laird, 1976), but the early attempts till limitedto world knowledge and assumed only very restricted sortsof processing.
Workers in computational linguistics intro-duced inference (Rieger, 1974; Schank, 1975) and othercomplex cognitive processes (Herskovits, 1982) into ourunderstanding of the role of word meaning.
Recently, lin-guists have given greater attention to the cognitive pro-cesses that would operate on their representations (e.g.,Talmy, 1983; Croft, 1986).
Independently, in AI an ef-fort arose to encode large amounts of commonsense knowl-edge (Hayes, 1979; Hobbs and Moore, 1985; Hobbs et al1985).
The research reported here represents a conver-gence of these various developments.
By developing coretheories of several fundamental phenomena and defininglexical items within these theories, using the full powerof predicate calculus, we awe able to cope with complex-Sties of word meaning that have hitherto escaped lexicalsemanticists, within a framework that gives full scope tothe planning and reasoning processes that manipulate rep-resentations of word meaning.In constructing the core theories we are attempting toadhere to several methodological principles.I.
One should aim for characterization of concepts.rather than definition.
One cannot generally expect to findnecessary and sulBcient conditions for a concept.
The mostwe tun hope for is to find a number of necessary condi-tions and ?
number of sufficient conditions.
This amountsto ~ying that ?
great many predicates are primitive, butprimitives that are highly interrelated with the rest of theknowledge base.2.
One lhould determine the minimal structure neces-ury  for ?
concept to make sense.
In efforts to axiomatizesome area, there are two positions one may take, exem-plified by set theory and by group theory.
In axiomatiz-ing set theory, one attempts to capture xactly some con-cept one ham strong intuitions about.
If the axiomatizationturns out to have unexpected models, this exposes an in-adequacy.
In group theory, by contrast, one characterizesan abstract clam of structures.
If there turn out to beunexpected models, this is a serendipitous discovery of anew phenomenon that we can reason about using an oldtheory.
The pervffisive character of metaphor in naturallanguage discourse shows that our commonsense theoriesof the world ought to be much more like group theory thanset theory.
By seeking minimal structures in axiomatizingconcepts, we optimize the possibilities of using the theoriesin metaphorical nd analogical contexts.
This principleis illustrated below in the section on regions.
One conse-quence of this principle is that our approach will seem moresyntactic than semantic.
We have concentrated more on127specifying axioms than on constructing models.
Our viewis that the chief role of models in our effort is for provingthe consistency and independence of sets of axioms, and forshowing their adequacy.
As an example of the last point,many of the spatial and temporal theories we constructare intended at least to have Euclidean space or the realnumbers as one model, and a subclass of graph-theoreticalstructures as other models.3.
A balance must be struck between attempting tocover all cases and aiming only for the prototypical cases.In general, we have tried to cover as many cases as poe-sable with an elegant axiomatization, in line with the twoprevious principles, but where the formalization begins tolook baroque, we assume that higher processes will suspendsome inferences in the marginal cases.
We assume that in-ferences will be drawn in a controlled fashion.
Thus, everyoutr~, highly context-dependent counterexample n ed notbe accounted for, and to a certain extent, definitions canbe geared specifically for a prototype.4.
Where competing ontologies uggest hemselves in ?domain, one should attempt o construct a theory that ac-commodates both.
Rather than commit oneself to adopt-ing one set of primitives rather than another, one shouldshow how each set of primitives can be characterized interms of the other.
Generally, each of the ontologies isuseful for different purposes, and it is convenient to beable to appeal to both.
Our treatment of time iUustratesthis.5.
The theories one constructs should be richer in axiomsthan in theorems.
In mathematics, one expectsto  statehalf a dozen axioms and prove dozens of theorems fromthem.
In encoding commonsense knowledge it seems to bejust the opposite.
The theorems we seek to prove on thebasis of these axioms are theorems ?bout specific situationswhich are to be interpreted, in particular, theorems abouta text that the system is attempting to understand.6.
One should ?void falling into "black holes'.
Thereare a few "mysterious" concepts which crop up repeatedlyin the formalization of commonsense metaphysics.
Amongthese are "relevant* (that is, relevant to the task at hand)and "normative" {or conforming to some norm or pattern).To insist upon giving a satisfactory analysis of these beforeusing them in analyzing other concepts is to crom the eventhorizon that separates lexical semantics from philosophy.On the other hand, our experience suggests that to ?voidtheir use entirely is crippling; the lexical semantics of ?wide variety of other terms depends upon them.
Instead,we have decided to leave them minimally analyzed for themoment and use them without scruple in the analysis ofother commonsense concepts.
This approach will allow usto accumulate many examples of the use of these mysteri-ous concepts, and in the end, contribute to their success-ful analysis.
The use of these concepts appears below inthe discussions of the words "immediately", sample',  and"operate".We chose as an initial target problem to encode the com-monsense knowledge that underlies the concept of "wear",as in ?
part of a device wearing out.
Our aim was to define"we?.r" in ternm of predicates characterized elsewhere inthe knowledge base and to infer consequences of wear.
Forsomething to wear, we decided, is for it to lose impercepti-ble bits of material from its surface due to abrasive actionover time.
One goal,which we have not yet achieved, is tobe able to prove as a theorem that since the shape of a partof ?
mechanical device is often functional and since loss ofmaterial can result in ?
change of shape, wear of a part of?
device can result in the failure of the device as a whole.In addition, as we have proceded, we have characterized anumber of words found in a set of target texts, as it hasbecome possible.We are encoding the knowledge as axioms in what isfor the most part ?
first-order logic, described in Hobbs(1985a), although quantification over predicates i some-times convenient.
In the formalism there is a nominaliza-tion operator " ' " for reifying events and conditions, asexpressed in the following axiom schema:0'*)~(*) E (3.
)~(e, .)
^ E~ot(e)That is, p is true of z if and only if there is a condition eof p being true of z and e exists in the real world.In our implementation soEar, we have been proving sim-ple theorems from our axioms using the CG5 theorem-prover developed by Mark Stickel (1982), but we are onlynow beginning to use the knowledge base in text process-inf.2 Requ i rements  on Arguments  ofPredicatesThere is a notational convention used below that deservessome explanation.
It has frequently been noted that re-lational words in natural language can take only certaintypes of words as their arguments.
These are usually de-scribed as selectional constraints.
The same is true of pred-icJttm in our knowledge base.
They are expressed below byru in  of the formp(*, y) : .
(*, y)This means that for p even to make sense applied to r andIf, it must be the case that r is true of z and y.
The logicalimport of this rule is that wherever there is an axiom ofthe form0'*,v)p(.,y) D q(.,.
)this is really to be read as(vz, y)p(z,~) ^ r(z,,) D q(z,y)128The checking of selectional constraints, therefore, falls outas a by-product of other logical operations: the constraintr(z, y) must be verified if anything else is to be proven fromp(z, ~).The simplest example of such an r(z, If) is a conjunctionof sort constraints r,(z)  ^  r,(y).
Our approach is a gener-alization of this, because much more complex requirementscan be placed on the arguments.
Consider, for example,the verb "range".
if z ranges from If to : ,  there must bea scale s that includes It and z, and z must be a set of en-tr ies that are located at various places on the scale.
Thiscan be represented as follows:range(z, If, : )  : (3.}.eels(.}
^ If E ?^ z E ?
^ .
s t ( z )^ (vu)lu E : 3 (3v)v e ?
^ ~(n,  v)\]3 The  Knowledge  Base3 .1  Sets and GranularityAt the foundation of the knowledge base is an axiomatizwtion of set theory.
It follows the standard Zermelo-Frankelapproach, except hat there is no Axiom of Infinity.Since so many concepts used in discourse are $q'ain-dependent, a theory of granularity isalso fundamental (seeHobbs 1985b).
A grain is defined in terms of an indistin-guishability relation, which is reflexive and symmetric, butnot necessarily transitive.
One grain can be a reJ~nemealof another with the obvious definition.
The most refinedgrain is the identity grain, i.e., the one in which every twodistinct elements are distinguishable.
One possible rela-tionship between two grains, one of which is z refinementof the other, is what we call an "Archimedean relation',after the Archimedean property of real numbers.
Intu-itively, if enough events occur that are imperceptible at thecoarser grain 9* but perceptible at the ?ner grain Ih, thenthe aggregate will eventually be.perceptible at the coarsergrain.
This is an important property in phenomena 1rob.ject to the Heap Paradox.
Wear, for instance, eventuallyhas significant consequences.3.2  Sca lesA great many of the most common words in English havrescales as their subject matter.
This includes many prepmbtions, the most common adverbs, comparatives, and manyabstract verbs.
When spatial vocabulary isused metaphor-ically, it is generally the scalar aspect of space that carriesover to the target domain.
A scale is defined as a set ofelements, together with a partial ordering and a granular,.ity (or an indistinguishability relation).
The partial or-dering and the indistinguishability relation are consistentwith each other.0fz.if .z)z<yAif~z D z<zVz~zIt is useful to have an adjacency relation between points ona scale, and there are a number of ways we could introduceit.
We could simply take it to be primitive; in a scalehaving a distance function, we could define two points tobe adjacent when the distance between them is less thansome ~; finally, we could define adjacency in terms of thegrain-size:fvz, y.,}a~(z, r.') =-(3 :), ~ ,  ^ ,  ~ If ^ -,\[z ~ If\],Two important possible properties of scales are connect-edness and denseness.
We can say that two elements of ascale are connected by a chain of adj relations:(VZ.

A scale is dense if between any two pointsthere is a third point, until the two points are so closetogether that the grain-size won't let us tell what the situ-ation is.

^ ,connected(i)The relations between time intervals that Allen andKauts (1985) have defined can be defined in a straight-forward manner in the approach presented here, appliedto intervth in general.A concept closely related to Scales is that of a "cycle'.This is a system which has a natural ordering locally butcontains a loop globally.
Examples include the color wheel,clock times, and geographical locations ordered by "eastof..  %%'o have axiomatized cycles iri terms of a ternary/asfween relation, whose axioms parallel the axioms for apartial ordering.The figure-ground relationship is of fundamental impor-tance in language.
We encode this with the primitive pred-icate af.
The minimal structure that seems to be necessaryfor something to be a ground is that of a scale; hence, thisis a selectional constraint on the arguments of at.129at(z, ~} : (3 s}y ?
s ^ scale(s)At this point, we are already in ?
position to define somefairly complex words.
As an illustration, we give the ex-ample of "range* as in "z ranges from It to z":(V=, V, z)range(=, U, :) -(3 s, s|, ul, us)scale(s},^ swbscale(el, s)^bottom(y, s,} ^  top(z,s,)^"1 ?

s, A tt(u,t,}\]A very important scale is the linearly ordered scale ofnumbers.
We do not plan to reason axiomatically aboutnumbers, but it is useful in natural language processing tohave encoded a few facts about numbers.
For example, ?set has a cardinality which is an element of the numberscale.Verticality is a concept that would be most properly an-alyzed in the section on space, but it is a property thatmany other scales have acquired metaphorically, for what-ever reason.
The number scale is one of these.
Even in theabsence of an analysis of verticality, it is ?
useful propertyto have as a primitive in lexical semantics.The word "high* is a vague term that asserts an entity isin the upper region of some scale.
It requires that the scalebe a vertical one, such as the number scale.
The vertical-ity requirement distinguishes "high* from the more gen-eral term'very* ;  we can say "very hard* but not "highlyhard' .
The phrase "highly planar" sounds all right be-cause the high register of "planar* suggests a quantifiable,scientific accuracy, whereas the low register of "fiat* makes"highly fiat* sound much worse.The test of any definition is whether it allows one to drawthe appropriate inferences.
In our target exts, the phrase"high usage* occurs.
Usage is a set of using events, and theverticality requirement on "high" forces us to coerce thephrase into "a high or large number of using events".
Com-bining this with an axiom that says that the use of ?
me-chanical device involves the likelihood of abrasive vents,as defined below, and with the definition of "wear" in termsof abrasive vents, we should be able to conclude the like-lihood of wear.3.3  Time: Two OntologlesThere are two possible ontoiogies for time.
In the first, theone most acceptable to the mathematically minded, thereis a time line, which is a scale having some topologicalstructure.
We can stipulate the time line to be linearlyordered (although it is not in approaches that build ig-norance of relative times into the representation f time(e.g., Hobbs, 1974) nor in approaches using branching fu-tures (e.g., McDermott, 1985)), and we can stipulate it tobe dense (although it is not in the situation calculus).
Wetake before to be the ordering on the time line:(Vtl, ts}beforc(t,, t:) .~(3 T, <}Time-line(T} ^ order(<, T)^t ie  ~ A tzET  At l  ~t2We allow both instants and intervals of time.
Most eventsoccur at some instant or during some interval.
In thisapproach, nearly every predicate takes a time argument.In the second ontology, the one that seems to be moredeeply rooted in language, the world consists of a largenumber of more or less independent processes, or histories,or sequences ofevents.
There is a primitive relation changebetween conditions.
Thus,can.go(e,, ~} ^ p(e,, z} ^ ?
(e:, z)says that there is a change from the condition el of p beingtrue of z to the condition ez of q being true of z.The time line in this ontology is then an artificial con-struct, ?
regular sequence of imagined abstract events--think of them as ticks of a clock in the National Bureauof Standards--to which other events can be related.
Thechange ontology seems to correspond to the way we e?-perience the world.
We recognize relations of causality,change of state, and copresence among events and condi-tions.
When events are not related in these ways, judg-ments of relative time must be mediated by copresencerelations between the events and events on a clock andchange of state relations on the clock.The predicate change possesses & limited transitivity.There has been ?
change from Reagan being an actor toReagan being President, even though he was governor inbetween.
But we probably do not want to say there hasbeen ?
change from Reagan being an actor to MargaretThatcher being Prime Minister, even though the secondcomes after the first.We can say that times, viewed in this ontology as events,always have a change relation between them.
(Vti, t:Jbefore(tl,t:} ~ ehange(tl, t:)The predicate change is related to before by the axiom(re,, ca}change(e,, e:)(3 el, t:)at(el, tl )^at(es, t } ^  ks fore(t1, t:)This does not allow us to derive change of state from tern-pond succession.
For this, we need axioms of the form~?e,,q,t,,tz, m)f(e,,z) A at(e,,G)^fI(ez, z ) ^ at(ca, t=) ^  bcfore(tl,l~)chance(el, ?
:)That is, if z is p at time tl and q at a later time t:, thenthere has been a change of state from one to the other.Time arguments in predications can be viewed as abbrevi-ations:(v=,t)p(=,t} -= (3e)f(e,:) ^ ut(e, t)130The word "move', or the predica~ move, (as in "zmoves from g to z ' )  can tbe?
be defined equivale?tly interms of change(Vz, y, .

m(3 is, t,)at(z, y, t, ) ^ at(z, z, t2) ^ before(tt, f,)In English and apparently all other natural languages,both ontologies are represented i?
the lexicon.
The timeline ontology is found i?
clock and calendar terms, tensesystems of verbs, and in the deictic temporal locatives uchas "yesterday*, "today*, "tomorrow*, "last night", sad soon.
The change ontology is exhibited in mvst verbs, andin temporal clausal connectives.
The universal presenceof both classes of lexical items and grammatical mark-ers in natural languages requires a theory which can ac-commodate both o?tologies, illustrating the importance ofmethodological principle 4.Among temporal connectives, the word "while" presentsinteresting problems.
I ?
"st while e~', s2 must be an eventoccurring over ?
time interval; et must be an event andmay occur either at a point or over an interval.
One% firstguess is that the point or interval for et must be includedin the interval for ca.
However, there are cases, such asit rained while I was in Philadelphia.orThe electricity should be off while the switch isbeing repaired.which suggest the reading "h  is included in el*.
We cameto the conclusion that one can infer ?o more than thates and e, overlap, and any tigh(er constraints result fromimplicatures from background knowledge.The word "immediately* also presents a number of prob-lems.
It requires its argument e to be an ordering relationbetween two entities z and g on some scale s.immediate(e} : (3 z ,  y, s ) less- lhan' (e ,  z ,  It, s)It is not clear what the constraints on the scale are.
Tem-poral and spatial scales are okay, as i?
"immediately after'the alarm* and "immediately to the left', but the size galeis?
't:* John is immediately larger than Bill.Etymologically, it means that there are no intermediateentities between z and y on s. Thus,OP' e, z, y, s) immediate( ) ^ less-Shah'(e, z  71, s)D -~(3z)less-than(z, z, s) ^ less-than(z, 7I, s)S /  BFigure I: The simplest space.However, this will only work if we r~trict z to be a relevantentity.
For example, in the sentenceWe disengaged the compressor immediately afterthe alarm.the implication is that ?o event that could damage thecompressor ccurred between the alarm and the disengage-ment, since the text is about equipment failure.3.4 Spaces  and  D imens lon :  The  Min lma lStructureThe notion of dimension has been made precise in linear al-|ebr4.
Since the concept of a region is used metaphoricallyu well ms i?
the spatial sense, however, we were concernedto determine the minimal structure that a system requiresfor it to make sense to call it a space of more than onedimension.
For a two.dimensional space, tt~re must be ascale, or partial ordering, for each dimension.
Moreover,the two scales must be independent, in that the order ofelements o?
one scale can not be determined from theirorder on the other.

A?
u?surprising co?sequence of this definition is thatthe minima\] example of a two*dimensional space consistsof three points (three points determine a plane}, e.g., thepoints A, B, ud  C, whereA <t B, A <t C, C <, A, A <z B.This is Illustrated in Figure 1.The dimensional scales are apparently found in all nat-?
rat languages i?
relevant domains.
The familiar three-dimensional space of common sense is defined by the threescale pairs "up-down", "front-back", and "left-right'; thetwo*dimensional p ane of the commonsense conception ofthe earth's surface is represented by the two scale pairs"north-south" and "east-west".131The simplest, although not the only, way to define ad-jacency in the space is as adjacency on both scales:(?
z, y, sp)adj(z, y, sp)(B s,, .,)scale, (s,, sp) ^ sosle,(s:, sp)^adj(z,~,s,} ^ ad/(z, y, s,)A region is a subset of a space.
'I~he surface and interior ofa region can be defined in terms of adjacency, in ?
mannerparalleling the definition of a boundary in point-set opoi-og)'.
In the following, s is the boundary or surface of ?
two-or three-dimensional region ?
embedded in a space sp.
(vs, r}sur/'acc(s, r ?p) ~_(Vz )z~ r D \ [ zes(EEy}(y ?
sp ^  -,(y E r) A adj(z,y, sp))\]Finally, we can define the notion of "contact" in terms ofpoints in different regions being adjacent.
(Vr,, r,, sp)eontact(r, , r,, sp) --=disjoint(rl ,r2) A(Ez, y}(z E r, A y E r. ^ adj(z, Thsp) )By picking the scales and defining adjacency right, wecan talk about points of contact between communicationalnetworks, systems of knowledge, and other metaphoricaldomains.
By picking the scales to be the real line anddefining adjacency in terms of C-neighborhoods, we get Eu-clidean space and can talk about contact between physicalobjects.3.5 Mater ia lPhysical objects and materials must be distinguished, justas they are apparently distinguished in every natural an-guage, by means of the count noun - mass noun distinc-tion.
A physical object is not a bit of material, but ratheris comprised of a bit of material at any given time.
Thus,rivers and human bodies are physical objects, even thoughtheir material constitution changes over time.
This distinc-tion also allows us to talk about an object losing materialthrough wear and still being the same object.We will say that an entity b is a bit of material by meansof the expression material(b): Bits of material are char-acterized by both extension and cohesion.
The primitivepredication occupies(b, r t) encodes extension, saying that?
bit of material boccupies a region ?
at time t. The topol-ogy of a bit of material is then parasitic on the topology ofthe region it occupies.
A part bl of ?
bit of material b is ?bit of material whose occupied region is always ?
subregionof the region occupied by b. Point-like particles (particle)are defined in terms of points in the occupied region, dis-joint bits (disjointln't} in terms of disjointness of regions,and contact between bits in terms of contact between theirregions.
We can then state as follows the Principle of Non-Joint-Occupancy that two bits of material cannot occupythe same place at the same time:0' h, h)(di.jo~ntb~t (b,, h )D (V z, ~, b., b4)i.tcrior(b,, b,)A interior(b4, &,) A particle(z, b,)A ~rtide(y, b4)-,(Ez)(ut(~, ~} ^  .t(y, ~))At some future point in our work, this may emerge as aconsequence of a richer theory of cohesion and force.The cohesion of materials is also a primitive property,for we must distinguish between a bump on the surface ofu object tad  ?
chip merely lying on the surface.
Cohesiondepends on ?
primitive relation bond between particles ofmaterial, paralleling the role of adj in regions.
The relationattached is defined as the transitive closure of bond.
Atopology of cohesion is built up in a manner analogousto the topology of regions.
In addition, we have encodedthe relation that bond bears to motion, i.e.
that bondedbits remain adjacent and that one moves when the otherdoes, tad the relation of bond to force, i.e.
that there is acharacteristic force that breaks a bond' in a given material.Different materials react in different ways to forces ofvarious strengths.
Materials ubjected to force exhibit orfail to exhibit several invariance properties, proposed byHager (1985).
If the material is shape-invariant with re-spect to ?
particular force, its shape remains the same.If it is topologically invariant, particles that are adjacentremain adjacent.
Shape invariance implies topological in-variance.
Subject to forces of a certain strength or de-gree dl, ?
material ceases being shape-invariant.
At aforce of strength d: > dl, it ceases being topologicallyiavaxiant, and at ?
force of strength d?
_~ d:, it sim-ply break?.
Metals exhibit the full range of possibilities,that is, 0 < dl < d: < dl < oo.
For forces of strengthd < dl, the material is "hard"; for forces of strength dwhere d~ < d < d,, it is "flexible*; for forces of strengthd where d, < d < ds, it is "malleable".
Words such as"ductile" and "elastic" can be defined in terms of this vo-cabulary, together with predicates about the geometry ofthe bit of material.
Words such as "brittle" (d, = d, = da)ud  "fluid" (d, = O, d, = co) can also be defined in thesefermi.
While w?
should not expect to be able to definevarious material terms, like "metal" and "ceramic',  wecan certainly chanu:terize many of their properties withthis vocabulary.Because of its iavariance properties, material interactswith containment tad  motion.
The word "clog" illustratesthil.
The predicate clog is a three-place relation: z clogsagaiust he flow of z.
It is the obstruction by z of :%motion through It, but with the selectional restriction that?
must be something that can flow, such is  a liquid, gas,or powder.
If a rope is passing through a hole in a board,and ?
knot in the rope prevents it from going through, wedo not say that the hole is clogged.
On the other hand,there do not seem to be any selectional constraints on z.In particular, z can be identical with z: glue, sand, ormolasses can clog a passageway against its own flow.
We132can speak of clogging where the obstruction of flow is notcomplete, but it must be thought of as "nearly" complete.3.6 Other Domains3.6.1 Causal  Connect ionAttachment within materials is one variety of caumd con-nection.
In general, if two entities z and W are causallyconnected with respect to some behavior pof z, then when-ever p happens to z, there is some corresponding behaviorq that happens to y.
In the case of attachment, p and qare both move.
A particularly common variety of causalconnection between two entities is one mediated by the mo-tion of a third entity from one to the other.
(This mightbe called a *vector boson* connection.)
Photons medi-ating the connection between the sun and our eyes, raindrops connecting a state of the clouds with the wetness ofour skin and clothes, a virus being transmitted from oneperson to another, and utterances passing between peo-ple are all examples of such causal connections.
Barriers,openings, and penetration are all with respect o paths ofcausal connection.3.6.2 ForceThe concept of "force" is axiomatized, in a way consistentwith Talmy's treatment (1985), in terms of the predica-tions force(a, b, dl ) and resist(b, a, d:)--a forces against bwith strength dl and b resists a's action with strength d2.We can infer motion from facts about relative strength.This treatment can also be specialized to Newtonian force,where we have not merely movement, but acceleration.
Inaddition, in spaces in which orientation is defined, forcescan have an orientation, and a version of the Parallelogramof Forces Law can be encoded.
Finally, force interacts withshape in ways characterized by words like "stretch*, "com-press", "bend*, "twist*, and "shear".3.6.3 Systems and Funct iona l i tyAn important concept is the notion of a "system", whichis a set of entities, a set of their properties, and a set ofrelations among them.
A common kind of system is onein which the entities are events and conditions and therelations are causal and enabling relations.
A mechanicaldevice can be described ~ such a system--in a sense, interms of the plan it executes in its operation.
The functionof various parts and of conditions of those parts is then therole they play in this system, or plan.The intransitive sense of "operate', as inThe diesel was operating.involves systems and functionality.
If an entity z oper-ates, then there must be a larger system s of which z isa pap.
t. The entity z itself is a system with parts.
Theseparts undergo normative s~te  changes, thereby causing zto undergo normative state changes, thereby causing z toproduce an effect with a normative function in the largersystem a.
The concept of "normative* is discussed below.8.6.4 ShapeWe have been approaching the problem of characterizingshape from "a number of different angles.
The classicaltreatment of shape is via the notion of "similarity* in Eu-clidean geometry, and in Hilbert's formal reconstruction ofEuclidean geometry (Hilbert, 1902} the key primitive corncept seems to be that of "congruent angles*.
Therefore,we first sought to develop a theory of "orientation".
Theshape of an object can then be characterized in terms ofchanges in orientation of a tangent as one moves about onthe surface of the object, as is done in vision research (e.g.,Zahn and Roskies, 1972).
In all of this, since "shape" canbe used loosely and metaphorically, one question we areasking is whether some minimal, abstract structure can befound in which the notion of "shape* makes sense.
Con-aider, for instance, a graph in which one scale is discrete,or even unordered.
Accordingly, we have been examining* number of examples, asking when it seems right ;o saytwo structures have different shapes.We have also examined the interactions of shape andfunctionality (cf.
Davis, 1984).
What seems to be cru-cial is how the shape of an obstacle constrains the motionof a substance or of an object of a particular shape (cf.Shoham, 1985).
Thus, a funnel concentrates the flow of aliquid, and similarly, a wedge concentrates force.
A boxpushed against a ridge in the floor will topple, and a wheeli s ,  limiting case of continuous toppling.3.T Hitting, Abrasion, Wear, and Re-hated ConceptsFor z to hit If is for z to move into contact with y withsome force.The basic scenario for an abrasive vent is that there isu impinging bit of material m which hits an object o andby doing so removes a pointlike bit of material be from thesurface of o:ebr -~r (e ,  m, o, be) : mat~-/.

Thus, the link between wear andabrasion is via the common notion of abrasive vents, notvia a definition of wear in terms of abrasion.

Ifz is distributed in tl, then I/ is ?
system tad z is ?
setof entities which are located at components of y.
For thedistribution to be wide, most of the elements of a partitionof II determined independently of the distribution mustcontain components which have'elements of z at thelm.The word ` `wear" is one of a large class of other eventsinvolving cumulative, gradual oss of material - events de-scribed by words like "chip*, "corrode', "file', "erode*,"rub*, "sand", "grind*, "weather", "rust ' ,  "tarnish', "eat?
way*, "rot*, and "decay*.
All of these lexica\] items cannow be defined as variations on the definition of "wear*,since we have built up the axiomatizatioas underlying"wear".
We are now in a position to characterize the en-tire class.
We will illustrate this by defining two differenttypes of variants of "wear* - "chip" and "corrode'.
"Chip* differs from "wear" in three ways: the bit ofmaterial removed in one abrasive vent is larger (it neednot be point-like), it need not happen because of a mate-rial hitting against he object, and "chip* does not require(though it does permit) a large collection of such events:one can say that some object is chipped if there is onlyone .chip in it.
Thus, we slightly alter the definition ofabr-evenl to accommodate hese changes:i re ,  m,  o, be)ch i f  (e, m,  o, be}(3 t, b, s, be, e,, e:, e,)at(e, t)^consists-of(o, b, t) ^ surface(s, b)^ part(be, s) ^ changd(e, el, e:)^ attached'(el, be, b) A not'(e:, el )"Corrode" differs from "wear* in that the bit of materialis chemically transformed as well as being detached by thecontact event; in fact, in some way the chemical transfor-mation causes the detachment.
This can be captured byadding ?
condition to the abrasive vent which renders it?

We can then generalize the above axiom aboutabrasive vents resulting in loss of material to the followingaxiom about detaching:(re, m, o, bo, b2, e,, e:, t:)detach'(e, m, o, be)^ changd(e, eh e:} ^  attached'(ct, be, b)^ not'(ez, e,) ^ at(e:, t:)^ Consists-of(o, b:, t:)D -,(part(be, b:))4 Re levance  and the Normat iveMany of the concepts we are investigating have driven usinexorably to the problems of what is meant by "relevant*and by "normative*.
We do not pretend to have solvedthese problems.
But for each of these concepts we do havethe beginnings of an account hat can play a role in anal-ysis, if not yet in implementation.Our view of relevance, briefly stated, is that somethingis relevant o some goal if it is a part of a plan to achievethat goal.
\[A formal treatment of a similar view is given inDavies and Russell, 1986.)
We can illustrate this with anexample involving the word "sample*.
If a bit of materialz is a sample of another bit of material y, then z is a partof y, and moreover, there are relevant properties p and qsuch that it is believed that if p is true of z then q is trueof y.
That is, looking at the properties of the sample tellsus something important about the properties of the whole.Frequently, p and q are the same property.
In our targettexts, the following sentence occurs:134We retained an oil sample for future inspection.The oil in the sample is a part of the total lube oil in thelube oil system, and it is believed that a property of thesample, such as "contaminated with metal particles', willbe true of all of the lube oil as well, and that this willgive information about po~ible wear on the bearings.
It istherefore relevant o the goal of maintaining the machineryin good working order.We have arrived at the following provisional account ofwhat it means to be "normative'.
For an entity to exhibita normative condition or behavior, it must first of all be acomponent of a larger system.
This system has structurein the form of relations among its components.
A pat-tern is a property of the system, namely, the property of?
subset of these stuctural relations holding.
A norm is apattern which is established either by conventional stipula-tion or by statistical regularity.
An entity is behaving in anormative fashion if it is a component of a system and in-stantiates a norm within that system.
The word "operate"given above illustrates this.
When we say that an engineis operating, we have in mind a larger system, the devicethe engine drives, to which the engine may bear variouspossible relations.
A subset of these relations is stipulatedto be the norm--the way it is supposed to work.
We sayit is operating when it is instantiating this norm.5 ConclusionThe research we have been engaged in has forced us to ex-plicate a complex set of commonsense concepts.
Since wehave done it in as general a fashion as possible, we mayexpect that it will be possible to axiomatize a large num-ber of other areas, including areas unrelated to mechanicaldevices, building on this foundation.
The very fact that wehave been able to characterize words as diverse as "range',"immediately', "brittle', ~operate" and "wear" shows thepromise of this approach.AcknowledgementsThe research reported here was funded by the Defense Ad-vanced Research Projects AGency under Office of NavalResearch contract N00014-85-C-0013.
