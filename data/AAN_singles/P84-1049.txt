USE OF H~ru'RISTIC KN~L~EDGE IN CHINF-.SELANGUAGEANALYSISYiming Yang, Toyoaki Nishida and Shuji DoshitaDepartment of Information Science,Kyoto University,Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606, JAPANABSTRACTThis paper describes an analysis methodwhich uses heuristic knowledge to find localsyntactic structures of Chinese sentences.
Wecall it a preprocessing, because we use it beforewe do global syntactic structure analysisCl\]of theinput sentence.
Our purpose is to guide theglobal analysis through the search space, toavoid unnecessary computation.To realize this, we use a set of specialwords that appear in commonly used patterns inChinese.
We call them "characteristic words" .They enable us to pick out fragments that mightfigure in the syntactic structure of thesentence.
Knowledge concerning the use ofcharacteristic words enables us to ratealternative fragments, according to patternstatistics, fragment length, distance betweencharacteristic words, and so on.
The prepro-cessing system proposes to the global analysislevel a most "likely" partial structure.
In casethis choice is rejected, backtracking looks for asecond choice, and so on.For our system, we use 200 characteristicwords.
Their rules are written by 101 automata.We tested them against 120 sentences taken froma Chinese physics text book.
For this limitedset, correct partial structures were proposed asfirst choice for 94% of sentences.
Allowing a2nd choice_, the score is 98%, with a 3rd choice,the score is 100%.I.
THE PROBLEM OF CHINESELANGUAGE ANALYSISBeing a language in which only characters( ideograns ) are used, Chinese language hasspecific problems.
Compared to languages suchas English, there are few formal inflections toindicate the grammatical category of a word, andthe few inflections that do exist are oftenomitted.In English, postfixes are often used todistinguish syntactical categories (e.g.
transla-tion, translate; difficul!, dificulty), but inChinese it is very common to use the same word(characters) for a verb, a noun, an adjective,etc..
So the ambiguity of syntactic category ofwords is a big problem in Chinese analysis.In another exa~ole, in English, "-ing" isused to indicate a participle, or "-ed" can beused to distinguish passive mode from active.
InChinese, there is nothing to indicate participle,and although there is aword,  "~ " , whosefunction is to indicate passive mode, it is oftenomitted.
Thus for a verb occurring in a sentence,there is often no w~y of telling if it transitiveor intransitive, active or passive, participle orpredicate of the main sentence, so there may bemany ambiguities in deciding the structure itoccurs in.If we attempt Chinese language analysisusing a conputer, and try to perform thesyntactic analysis in a straightforward way, werun into a combinatorial explosion due to suchambiguities.
What is lacking, therefore, is asimple method to decide syntactic structure.2.
REDUCING AMBIGUITIES USINGCHARACTERISTIC WORDSIn the Chinese language, there is a kind ofword (such as preposition, auxiliary verb,modifier verb, adverbial noun, etc..), that isused as an independant word (not an affix).
Theyusually have key functions, they are not sonumerous, their use is very frequent, and so theymay be used to reduce anbiguities.
Here we shallcall them "characteristic words".Several hundreds of these words have beencollected by linguists\[2\],and they are often usedto distinguish the detailed meaning in each partof a Chinese sentence.
Here we selected about200 such words, and we use them to try to pickout fragments of the sentence and figure outtheir syntactic structure before we attemptglobal syntactic analysis and deep meaninganalysis.The use of the characteristic words isdescribed below.a) Category decision:Some characteristic words may serve todecide the category of neighboring words.
Forexample, words such as "~ ", "~",  "~", "4~",are rather like verb postfixes, indicating thatthe preceding word must be a verb, even thoughthe same characters might spell a noun.
Wordslike " ~ ", " ~ ", can be used as both verb andauxiliary.
If, for example, "~ " is followed bya word that could be read as either a verb or anoun, then this word is a verb and "~ " is anauxiliary.b) Fragment pickingIn Chinese, many prepositional phrases start222I fl,PPo ox xf2, #vPo 0x~ ~f5,  #VPo o ox xTranslation:?oxThe ball must run a longer distance before returningto the initial altitude on this slope.distinguish a word fremotherscharacteristical wordfragmentverb Or adjectivethe word can not he predicate of sentenceFig.iAn Example of Fragment Findingwith a preposition such as "~", "~", "~", andfinish on a characteristic word belonging to asubset of adverbial nouns that are often used toexpress position, direction, etc..
When suchcharacteristic words are spotted in a sentence,they serve to forecast a prepositional phrase.Another example is the pattern "...{ ... ~" ,  useda little like "... is to ..." in English, so whenwe find it, we may predict a verbal phrase from"~ " to "%.~", that is in addition the predicateVP of the sentence.These forecasts make it more likely for thesubsequent analysis system to find the correctphrase early.c) Role decidingThe preceding rules are rather simple ruleslike a human might use.
With a cxmputer it ispossible to use more ~ lex  rules (such asinvolving many exceptions or providing partialknowledge) with the same efficiency.
For example,a rule can not usually with certainty decide if agiven verb is the predicate of a sentence, but weknow that a predicate is not likely to precede acharacteristic word such as "~9 " or " { " orfollow a word like "~-~", "~"  or "~".
We usethis kind of rule to reduce the range of possiblepredicates.
This knowledge can be used in turnto predict the partial structure in a sentence,because the verbal proposition begins with thepredicate and ends at the end of the sentence.In the example shown in Fig.l, fragments f3and f4 are obtained through step (a) (see above),fl through (b), and f2 and f5 through (c).
Thesymbol "o" shows a possible predicate, and "x"means that the possibility has been ruled out.Out of 7 possibilities, only 2 remained.3.
RESOLVING CONFLICTThe rules we mentioned above are written foreach characteristic word independantly.
They arenot absolute rules, so when they are applied to asentence, several fragments may overlap and thusbe incrmpatible.
Several crmabinations ofcompatible fragments my exist, and frcm these wemust choose the most "likely" one.
Instead ofattempting to evaluate the likelihood of everycombination, we use a scheme that gives differentpriority scores to each fragment, and thusconstructs directly the "hest" combination.
Ifthis combination (partial structure) is rejectedby subsequent analysis, back-tracking occurs andsearches for the next possibility, and so on.Fig.2 shows an example involving conflictingfragments.
We select f3 first because it has thehighest priority.
We find that f2 , f4 and f5collide with f3, so only fl is then selected next.The resulting combination (fl,f3) is correct.Fig.3 shows the parsing result obtained bycomputer in our preprocessing subsystem.4.
PRIORITYIn the preprocessing, we determine all thepossible fragments that might occur in thesentence and involving the characteristic words.Then we give each one a measure of priority.
Thismeasure is a complex function, determined largelyby trial and error.
It is calculated by thefollowing principles:a) Kind of fragmentSome kinds of fragments, for example, com-pound verbs involving "~",  occur more often thanothers and are accordingly given higher priority223f2 , PPt" .

We distinguish 26 kinds of fragments.b) PrecisenessWe call "precise" a pattern that containsrecognizable characteristic words or subpatterns,and imprecise a pattern that contains words wecannot recognize at this stage.
For example, f3of Fig.2 is more precise than fl, f2 or f4.
Weput the more precise patterns on a higherpriority level.c) Fragment lengthLength is a useful parameter, but its effecton priority depends on the kind of fragment.Accordingly, a longer fragment gets higherpriority in some cases, lower priority in othercases.The actual rules are rather complex to stateexplicitly.
At present we use 7 levels ofpriority.tried the method on a set of mere complexsentences.
From the same textbook, out of 800sentences containing prepositional phrases, 80contained conflicts, involving 209 phrases.
Ofthese conflicts, in our test 83% ware resolved atfirst choice, 90% at second choice, 98% at thirdchoice.6.
SUMMARYIn this paper, we outlined a preprocessingtechnique for Chinese language analysis.Heuristic knowledge rules involving alimited set of characteristic words are used toforecast partial syntactic structure of sentencesbefore global analysis, thus restricting the paththrough the search space in syntactic analysis.Comparative processing using knowledge aboutpriority is introduced to resolve fragmentconflict, and so we can obtain the correctresult as early as possible.In conclusion, we expect this scheme to beuseful for efficient analysis of a language suchas Chinese that contains a lot of syntacticambiguities.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe wish to thank the members of our labora-tory for their help and fruitful discussions,and Dr. Alain de Cheveigne for help with theEnglish.REFERENCE\[i\].

PREPROCESSING EFFICIENCYThe preprocessing system for chineselanguage mentioned in the paper is in the courseof development and it is partly ~u~leted.
Theinputs are sentences separated into words (notconsecutive sequences of characters).
We use 200characteristic words and have written the rulesby I01 automata for ~ them.
As a preliminaryevaluation, we tested the system (partly by hand)against 120 sentences taken from a Chinesephysics text book.
Frem these 369 fragments wereobtained, of which 122 ware in conflict.
Theresult of preprocessing was correct at firstchoice ( no back-tracking ) in 94% of sentences.Allowing one back-tracking yeilded 98%, two back-trackings gave 100% correctness.In this limited set, few conflicting pre-positional phrases appeared.
To test theperformance of our preprocessing in this case we225
