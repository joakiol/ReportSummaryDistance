Although discourse annotations typically require much time and cost owing totheir complex nature, we realize discourse annotations in an extremely short time while retaininggood quality of the annotations by crowdsourcing two annotation subtasks.
In fact, our experi-ment to create a corpus comprising 30,000 Japanese sentences took less than eight hours to run.Based on this corpus, we also develop a supervised discourse parser and evaluate its performanceto verify the usefulness of the acquired corpus.1 IntroductionHumans understand text not by individually interpreting clauses or sentences, but by linking such a textfragment with another in a particular context.
To allow computers to understand text, it is essential tocapture the precise relations between these text fragments.
This kind of analysis is called discourseparsing or discourse structure analysis, and is an important and fundamental task in natural languageprocessing (NLP).
Systems for discourse parsing are, however, available only for major languages, suchas English, owing to the lack of corpora with discourse annotations.For English, several corpora with discourse annotations have been developed manually, consuming agreat deal of time and cost in the process.
These include the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al.,2008), RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2001), and Discourse Graphbank (Wolf and Gibson,2005).
Discourse parsers trained on these corpora have also been developed and practically used.
Tocreate the same resource-rich environment for another language, a quicker method than the conventionaltime-consuming framework should be sought.
One possible approach is to use crowdsourcing, whichhas actively been used to produce various language resources in recent years (e.g., (Snow et al., 2008;Negri et al., 2011; Hong and Baker, 2011; Fossati et al., 2013)).
It is, however, difficult to crowdsourcethe difficult judgments for discourse annotations, which typically consists of two steps: finding a pair ofspans with a certain relation and identifying the relation between the pair.In this paper, we propose a method for crowdsourcing discourse annotations that simplifies the proce-dure by dividing it into two steps.
The point is that by simplifying the annotation task it is suitable forcrowdsourcing, but does not skew the annotations for use in practical discourse parsing.
First, finding adiscourse unit for the span is a costly process, and thus we adopt a clause as the discourse unit, since thisis reliable enough to be automatically detected.
We also limit the length of each target document to threesentences and at most five clauses to facilitate the annotation task.
Secondly, we detect and annotateclause pairs in a document that hold logical discourse relations.
However, since this is too complicatedto assign as one task using crowdsourcing, we divide the task into two steps: determining the existenceof logical discourse relations and annotating the type of relation.
Our two-stage approach is a robustmethod in that it confirms the existence of the discourse relations twice.
We also designed the tagsetof discourse relations for crowdsourcing, which consists of two layers, where the upper layer containsthe following three classes: ?CONTINGENCY,?
?COMPARISON?
and ?OTHER.?

The resulting corpus consists of 10,000 documents,each of which comprises three sentences extracted from the web.
Carrying out this two-stage crowd-sourcing task took less than eight hours.
The time elapsed was significantly shorter than the conventionalcorpus building method.We also developed a discourse parser by exploiting the acquired corpus with discourse annotations.We learned a machine learning-based model for discourse parsing based on this corpus and evaluated itsperformance.
An F1 value of 37.9% was achieved for contingency relations, which would be roughlycomparable with state-of-the-art discourse parsers on English.
This result indicates the usefulness of theacquired corpus.
The resulting discourse parser would be effectively exploited in NLP applications, suchas sentiment analysis (Zirn et al., 2011) and contradiction detection (Murakami et al., 2009; Ennals etal., 2010).The novel contributions of this study are summarized below:?
We propose a framework for developing a corpus with discourse annotations using two-stage crowd-sourcing, which is both cheap and quick to execute, but still retains good quality of the annotations.?
We construct a Japanese discourse corpus in an extremely short time.?
We develop a discourse parser based on the acquired corpus.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 introduces related work, while Section3 describes our proposed framework and reports the experimental results for the creation of a corpus withdiscourse annotations.
Section 4 presents a method for discourse parsing based on the corpus as well assome experimental results.
Section 5 concludes the paper.2 Related WorkSnow et al.
(2008) applied crowdsourcing to five NLP annotation tasks, but the settings of these tasksare very simple.
There have also been several attempts to construct language resources with complexannotations using crowdsourcing.
Negri et al.
(2011) proposed a method for developing a cross-lingualtextual entailment (CLTE) corpus using crowdsourcing.
They tackled this complex data creation task bydividing it into several simple subtasks: sentence modification, type annotation and sentence translation.The creative CLTE task and subtasks are quite different from our non-creative task and subtasks ofdiscourse annotations.
Fossati et al.
(2013) proposed FrameNet annotations using crowdsourcing.
Theirmethod is a single-step approach to only detect frame elements.
They verified the usefulness of theirapproach through an experiment on a small set of verbs with only two frame ambiguities per verb.Although they seem to be running a larger-scale experiment, its result has not been revealed yet.
Hongand Baker (2011) presented a crowdsourcing method for selecting FrameNet frames, which is a part ofthe FrameNet annotation process.
Since their task is equivalent to word sense disambiguation, it is notvery complex compared to the whole FrameNet annotation process.
These FrameNet annotations arestill different from discourse annotations, which are our target.
To the best of our knowledge, there havebeen no attempts to crowdsource discourse annotations.There are several manually-crafted corpora with discourse annotation for English, such as the PennDiscourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008), RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2001), and DiscourseGraphbank (Wolf and Gibson, 2005).
These corpora were developed from English newspaper articles.Several attempts have been made to manually create corpora with discourse annotations for languagesother than English.
These include the Potsdam Commentary Corpus (Stede, 2004) for German (news-paper; 2,900 sentences), Rhetalho (Pardo et al., 2004) for Portuguese (scientific papers; 100 documents;1,350 sentences), and the RST Spanish Treebank for Spanish (da Cunha et al., 2011) (several genres;267 documents; 2,256 sentences).
All of these consist of relatively small numbers of sentences com-pared with the English corpora containing several tens of thousands sentences.270In recent years, there have been many studies on discourse parsing on the basis of the above hand-annotated corpora (e.g., (Pitler et al., 2009; Pitler and Nenkova, 2009; Subba and Di Eugenio, 2009;Hernault et al., 2010; Ghosh et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2012; Feng and Hirst, 2012; Joty et al., 2012; Jotyet al., 2013; Biran and McKeown, 2013; Lan et al., 2013)).
This surge of research on discourse parsingcan be attributed to the existence of corpora with discourse annotations.
However, the target language ismostly English since English is the only language that has large-scale discourse corpora.
To develop andimprove discourse parsers for languages other than English, it is necessary to build large-scale annotatedcorpora, especially in a short period if possible.3 Development of Corpus with Discourse Annotations using Crowdsourcing3.1 Corpus SpecificationsWe develop a tagged corpus in which pairs of discourse units are annotated with discourse relations.To achieve this, it is necessary to determine target documents, discourse units, and a discourse relationtagset.
The following subsections explain the details of these three aspects.3.1.1 Target Text and Discourse UnitIn previous studies on constructing discourse corpora, the target documents were mainly newspapertexts, such as the Wall Street Journal for English.
However, discourse parsers trained on such newspapercorpora usually have a problem of domain adaptation.
That is to say, while discourse parsers trained onnewspaper corpora are good at analyzing newspaper texts, they generally cannot perform well on textsof other domains.To address this problem, we set out to create an annotated corpus covering a variety of domains.Since the web contains many documents across a variety of domains, we use the Diverse DocumentLeads Corpus (Hangyo et al., 2012), which was extracted from the web.
Each document in this corpusconsists of the first three sentences of a Japanese web page, making these short documents suitable forour discourse annotation method based on crowdsourcing.We adopt the clause as a discourse unit, since spans are too fine-grained to annotate using crowdsourc-ing and sentences are too coarse-grained to capture discourse relations.
Clauses, which are automaticallyidentified, do not need to be manually modified since they are thought to be reliable enough.
Clauseidentification is performed using the rules of Shibata and Kurohashi (2005).
For example, the followingrules are used to identify clauses as our discourse units:?
clauses that function as a relatively strong boundary in a sentence are adopted,?
relative clauses are excluded.Since workers involved in our crowdsourcing task need to judge whether clause pairs have discourserelations, the load of these workers increases combinatorially as the number of clauses in a sentenceincreases.
To alleviate this problem, we limit the number of clauses in a document to five.
This limitationexcludes only about 5% of the documents in the original corpus.Our corpus consists of 10,000 documents corresponding to 30,000 sentences.
The total number ofclauses in this corpus is 39,032, and thus the average number of clauses in a document is 3.9.
The totalnumber of clause pairs is 59,426.3.1.2 Discourse Relation TagsetOne of our supposed applications of discourse parsing is to automatically generate a bird?s eye view of acontroversial topic as in Statement Map (Murakami et al., 2009) and Dispute Finder (Ennals et al., 2010),which identify various relations between statements, including contradictory relations.
We assume thatexpansion relations, such as elaboration and restatement, and temporal relations are not important for thispurpose.
This setting is similar to the work of Bethard et al.
(2008), which annotated temporal relationsindependently of causal relations.
We also suppose that temporal relations can be annotated separatelyfor NLP applications that require temporal information.
We determined the tagset of discourse relations271Upper type Lower type ExampleCONTINGENCYCause/Reason ???????????????????
[since (I) pushed the button] [hot water was turned on]Purpose ?????????????????????
[to pass the exam] [(I) studied a lot]Condition ?????????????????
[if (you) push the button] [hot water will be turned on]Ground ??????????????????????????
[here is his/her bag] [he/she would be still in the company]COMPARISONContrast ?????????????????????????????
[at that restaurant, sushi is good] [ramen is so-so]Concession ??????????????????????????
[that restaurant is surely good] [the price is high]OTHER (Other) ???????????????????
[After being back home] [it began to rain]Table 1: Discourse relation tagset with examples.by referring to the Penn Discourse Treebank.
This tagset consists of two layers, where the upper layercontains three classes and the lower layer seven classes as follows:?
CONTINGENCY?
Cause/Reason (causal relations and not conditional relations)?
Purpose (purpose-action relations where the purpose is not necessarily accomplished)?
Condition (conditional relations)?
Ground (other contingency relations including pragmatic cause/condition)?
COMPARISON (same as the Penn Discourse Treebank)?
Contrast?
Concession?
OTHER (other weak relation or no relation)Note that we do not consider the direction of relations to simplify the annotation task for crowdsourcing.Table 1 shows examples of our tagset.Therefore, our task is to annotate clause pairs in a document with one of the discourse relations givenabove.
Sample annotations of a document are shown below.
Here, clause boundaries are shown by ?

]3.2 Two-stage Crowdsourcing for Discourse AnnotationsWe create a corpus with discourse annotations using two-stage crowdsourcing.
We divide the annotationtask into the following two subtasks: determining whether a clause pair has a discourse relation excluding?OTHER,?
and then, ascertaining the type of discourse relation for a clause pair that passes the first stage.272Probability Number= 1.0 64> 0.99 554> 0.9 1,065> 0.8 1,379> 0.5 2,655> 0.2 4,827> 0.1 5,895> 0.01 9,068> 0.001 12,277> 0.0001 15,554Table 2: Number of clause pairs resulting from the judgments of discourse relation existence.3.2.1 Stage 1: Judgment of Discourse Relation ExistenceThis subtask determines whether each clause pair in a document has one of the following discourserelations: Cause/Reason, Purpose, Condition, Ground, Contrast, and Concession (that is, all the relationsexcept ?OTHER?).
Workers are shown examples of these relations and asked to determine only theexistence thereof.In this subtask, an item presented to a worker at a particular time consists of all the judgments ofclause pairs in a document.
By adopting this approach, each worker considers the entire document whenmaking his/her judgments.3.2.2 Stage 2: Judgment of Discourse Relation TypeThis subtask involves ascertaining the discourse relation type for a clause pair that passes the first stage.The result of this subtask is one of the seven lower types in our discourse relation tagset.
Workersare shown examples of these types and then asked to select one of the relations.
If a worker chooses?OTHER,?
this corresponds to canceling the positive determination of the existence of the discourserelation in stage one.In this subtask, an item is the judgment of a clause pair.
That is, if a document contains more thanone clause pair that must be judged, the judgments for this document are divided into multiple items,although this is rare.3.3 Experiment and DiscussionWe conducted an experiment of the two-stage crowdsourcing approach using Yahoo!
Crowdsourcing.1To increase the reliability of the produced corpus, we set the number of workers for each item for eachtask to 10.
The reason why we chose this value is as follows.
While Snow et al.
(2008) claimed that anaverage of 4 non-expert labels per item in order to emulate expert-level label quality, the quality of sometasks increased by increasing the number of workers to 10.
We also tested hidden gold-standard itemsonce every 10 items to examine worker?s quality.
If a worker failed these items in serial, he/she wouldhave to take a test to continue the task.We obtained judgments for the 59,426 clause pairs in the 10,000 documents of our corpus in thefirst stage of crowdsourcing, i.e., the subtask of determining the existence of discourse relations.
Wecalculated the probability of each label using GLAD2(Whitehill et al., 2009), which was proved tobe more reliable than the majority voting.
This probability corresponds to the probability of discourserelation existence of each clause pair.
Table 2 lists the results.
We set a probability threshold to selectthose clause pairs whose types were to be judged in the second stage of crowdsourcing.
With thisthreshold set to 0.01, 9,068 clause pairs (15.3% of all the clause pairs) were selected.
The threshold wasset fairly low to allow low-probability judgments to be re-examined in the second stage.1http://crowdsourcing.yahoo.co.jp/2http://mplab.ucsd.edu/?jake/OptimalLabelingRelease1.0.3.tar.gz273Lower type All prob > 0.8Cause/Reason 2,104 1,839 (87.4%)Purpose 755 584 (77.4%)Condition 1,109 925 (83.4%)Ground 442 273 (61.8%)Contrast 437 354 (81.0%)Concession 80 49 (61.3%)Sum of the above discourse relations 4,927 4,024 (81.7%)Other 4,141 3,753 (90.6%)Total 9,068 7,777 (85.8%)Table 3: Results of the judgments of lower discourse relation types.Upper type All prob > 0.8CONTINGENCY 4,439 3,993 (90.0%)COMPARISON 516 417 (80.8%)Sum of the above discourse relations 4,955 4,410 (89.0%)OTHER 4,113 3,753 (91.2%)Total 9,068 8,163 (90.0%)Table 4: Results of the judgments of upper discourse relation types.The discourse relation types of the 9,068 clause pairs were determined in the second stage of crowd-sourcing.
We extended GLAD (Whitehill et al., 2009) for application to multi-class tasks, and calculatedthe probability of the labels of each clause pair.
We assigned the label (discourse relation type) with thehighest probability to each clause pair.
Table 3 gives some statistics of the results.
The second column inthis table denotes the numbers of each discourse relation type, while the third column gives the numbersof each type of clause pair with a probability higher than 0.80.
Table 4 gives statistics of the results whenthe lower discourse relation types are merged into the upper types.
Table 5 shows some examples of theresulting annotations.Carrying out the two separate subtasks using crowdsourcing took approximately three hours and fivehours with 1,458 and 1,100 workers, respectively.
If we conduct this task at a single stage, it would takeapproximately 33 (5 hours / 0.153) hours.
It would be four times longer than our two-stage approach.Such single-stage approach is also not robust since it does not have a double check mechanism, withwhich the two-stage approach is equipped.
We spent 111 thousand yen and 113 thousand yen (approx-imately 1,100 USD, respectively) for these subtasks, which would be extremely less expensive than theprojects of conventional discourse annotations.For the examples in Table 5, we confirmed that the discourse relation types of the top four exampleswere surely correct.
However, we judged the type (Contrast) of the bottom example as incorrect.
Sincethe second clause is an instantiation of the first clause, the correct type should be ?Other.?
We found sucherrors especially in the clause pairs with a probability lower than 0.80.4 Development of Discourse Parser based on Acquired Discourse CorpusTo verify the usefulness of the acquired corpus with discourse annotations, we developed a superviseddiscourse parser based on the corpus, and evaluated its performance.
We built two discourse parsers usingthe annotations of the lower and upper discourse relation types, respectively.
From the annotations in thefirst stage of crowdsourcing (i.e., judging the existence of discourse relations), we assigned annotationswith a probability less than 0.01 as ?OTHER.?
Of the annotations acquired in the second stage (i.e.,judging discourse relation types), we adopted those with a probability greater than 0.80 and discardedthe rest.
After this preprocessing, we obtained 58,135 (50,358 + 7,777) instances of clause pairs forthe lower-type discourse parser and 58,521 (50,358 + 8,163) instances of clause pairs for the upper-type274Prob # W Type Document1.00 6/10 Cause/Reason ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????...

Of these, 4,024 (6.9%) and 4,410 (7.5%) instances, respectively, had one of the typesbesides ?OTHER.?
We conducted experiments using five-fold cross validation on these instances.To extract features of machine learning, we applied the Japanese morphological analyzer, JUMAN,3and the Japanese dependency parser, KNP,4to the corpus.
We used the features listed in Table 6, whichare usually used for discourse parsing.We adopted Opal (Yoshinaga and Kitsuregawa, 2010)5for the machine learning implementation.
Thistool enables online learning using a polynomial kernel.
As parameters for Opal, we used the passive-aggressive algorithm (PA-I) with a polynomial kernel of degree two as a learner and the extension tomulti-class classification (Matsushima et al., 2010).
The numbers of classes were seven and three for thelower- and upper-type discourse parsers, respectively.
We set the aggressiveness parameter C to 0.001,which generally achieves good performance for many classification tasks.
Other parameters were set tothe default values of Opal.To measure the performance of the discourse parsers, we adopted precision, recall and their harmonicmean (F1).
These metrics were calculated as the proportion of the number of correct clause pairs to the3http://nlp.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/?JUMAN4http://nlp.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/?KNP5http://www.tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/?ynaga/opal/275Name Descriptionclause distance clause distance between two clausessentence distance sentence distance between two clausesbag of words bag of words (lemmas) for each clausepredicate a content word (lemma) of the predicate of each clauseconjugation form of predicate a conjugation form of the predicate of each clauseconjunction a conjunction if it is located at the beginning of a clauseword overlapping ratio an overlapping ratio of words between the two clausesclause type a lexical type output by KNP for each clause (about 100 types)topic marker existence existence of a topic marker in each clausetopic marker cooccurrence existence of a topic marker in both clausesTable 6: Features for our discourse parsers.Type Precision Recall F1Cause/Reason 0.623 (441/708) 0.240 (441/1,839) 0.346Purpose 0.489 (44/90) 0.075 (44/584) 0.131Condition 0.581 (256/441) 0.277 (256/925) 0.375Ground 0.000 (0/12) 0.000 (0/273) 0.000Contrast 0.857 (6/7) 0.017 (6/354) 0.033Concession 0.000 (0/0) 0.000 (0/49) 0.000Other 0.944 (53,702/56,877) 0.992 (53,702/54,111) 0.968Table 7: Performance of our lower-type discourse parser.Type Precision Recall F1CONTINGENCY 0.625 (1,084/1,735) 0.272 (1,084/3,993) 0.379COMPARISON 0.412 (7/17) 0.017 (7/417) 0.032OTHER 0.942 (53,454/56,769) 0.988 (53,454/54,111) 0.964Table 8: Performance of our upper-type discourse parser.number of all recognized or gold-standard ones for each discourse relation type.
Tables 7 and 8 give theaccuracies for the lower- and upper-type discourse parsers, respectively.From Table 8, we can see that our upper-type discourse parser achieved an F1 of 37.9% for contingencyrelations.
It is difficult to compare our results with those in previous work due to the use of different dataset and different languages.
We, however, anticipate that our results would be comparable with thoseof state-of-the-art English discourse parsers.
For example, the end-to-end discourse parser of Lin et al.
(2012) achieved an F1 of 20.6% ?
46.8% on the Penn Discourse Treebank.We also obtained a low F1 for comparison relations.
This tendency is similar to the previous resultson the Penn Discourse Treebank.
The biggest cause of this low F1 is the lack of unambiguous explicitdiscourse connectives for these relations.
Although there are explicit discourse connectives in Japanese,many of them have multiple meanings and cannot be used as a direct clue for discourse relation detection(e.g., as described in Kaneko and Bekki (2014)).
As reported in Pitler et al.
(2009) and other studies,the identification of implicit discourse relations are notoriously difficult.
To improve its performance, weneed to incorporate external knowledge sources other than the training data into the discourse parsers.A promising way is to use large-scale knowledge resources that are automatically acquired from rawcorpora.2765 ConclusionWe presented a rapid approach for building a corpus with discourse annotations and a discourse parserusing two-stage crowdsourcing.
The acquired corpus is made publicly available and can be used forresearch purposes.6This corpus can be used not only to build a discourse parser but also to evaluateits performance.
The availability of the corpus with discourse annotations will accelerate the develop-ment and improvement of discourse parsing.
In the future, we intend integrating automatically acquiredknowledge from corpora into the discourse parsers to further enhance their performance.
We also aim toapply our framework to other languages without available corpora with discourse annotations.ReferencesSteven Bethard, William Corvey, Sara Klingenstein, and James H. Martin.
