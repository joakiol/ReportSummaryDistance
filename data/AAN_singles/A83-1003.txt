Examples of  ASK EnglishTo in t roduce  you to ASK, we w i l l  s ta r t  out  w i tha few examples  o f  quer ies  o f  a s imp le  data  baseconcerning ships.

The ASK Data StructuresAl though in the terminology of data basetheory, ASK can be considered as an "entity-relation" system, ASK retains its information inrecords which are interl inked in a semantic net.One reason we refer to ALE as simple is because icuses  only a few kinds of nodes in its semant icnet ,  namely:o ~lasseso ~bjectso Attributeso Relationsand the ctbvious corresponding arcs.
We speak ofthis as the COAR structure.
A~tributes are singlevalued, e.g., "father", "home port", " t i t le " ;relat ions may be mult ip le  valued, e.g., "child"~"cargo",  "author" .
The d i f fe rence  betweenattr ibutes and relat ions can be seen in thefollowing protoco l .>What is the cargo and home port of the Maru?cargo home portwheat London>The home port of Maru is Boston.London has been replaced by Boston as thehome port of Maru.>The cargo of Maru is coal.coal has been added as the cargo of Maru.>What i s  the cargo and home port of the Maru?cargo home portwheat BosConcoal - - -C.

DefinitionsTo make such a system more knowledgeable, oneneeds to be able co add def in i t ions that embodyin ter re la t ionsh ips  among the basic classes,objects, attr ibutes and relat ions of the data.The simplest form of definition is synonym:>definition:tub:old shipDefined.Although this form of definition allows one tointroduce abbreviations and many forms of jargon,more extensive forms of definition are desirable.Here are three illustrations using the same "ship"file as above.

VerbsMost verbs embody knowledge specif ic  to theapplication in which they are used, the exceptionsbeing the copula verbs.
Therefore the only verbsinitially known to the ASK System are "to be" and"to have".
The user  can add new verbs  byparaphrase.>verb:ships "go" to New York:destination ofships is New YorkDefined.>verb:ships "carry" coal from London toBoston:ships have coal as cargo, have Londonas home port and go to BostonDefined.>Each old ship carries what cargo to eachport?old ship port cargoUbu New York oilTokyo oilAlamo London wheatcoal18>What is  car r ied  by the Alamo?wheatcoal>Wheat is  car r ied  to London from what ports?New York>What c i t ies  does the Alamo carry  wheat to?London3.

INTEGRATION OF MULTIPLE OBJECT TYPESA.
Extension of COAR ~o Multiple Object TypesSo far we have i l lustrated ASK capabi l i t iesusing only two types of objects:individuals, e.g., "John Jones", "Maru"numbers,  e.g., "34.6 feet", " length ofMaru", "number of ships".ASK has been designed, however, to facilitate manykinds of objects.
This is a capability orthogonalto the simple COAR s t ructure  in that for any typesof objects there may be corresponding classes,attributes and relations.B.
An Examvle: Texts and T~xt Fi~esWe wil l  i l lustrate this mul t ip le  object typecapability with the additional object type: text.Once this new object type was added (together withprocedures to manipu late  texts, i.e., a "wordprocessor") then text classes, individual/text andtext / indiv idual  attr ibutes and relat ions wereimmediately available.
It was a small task to addan electronic mai l  system to ASK; all that wasrequired was an addit ion to the author izat ionprocedure that assigned to each newly authorizedperson a new text class as his/her mail box.>Create the text / text  re la t ion :commentThe text / text  re la t ion  co-~.ent has beenadded.>Create a file: budget correspondenceThe text class budget correspondence hasbeen added.>File the Budget Proposal in budgetcorrespondence.Budget Proposal has been added to the textclass budget correspondence.>Who have I received mail from?John SmithPeter Jackson20>Disp lay  my mai l  from John Smith .Fred,  Your Budget P roposa l  looks  good to me.Suggest  you submit  i t  as  i s .John>F i le  i t  in  my budget  cor respondence  f i l e .F i le  i t  \[my mai l  f rom John Smith \ ]  in  mybudget  cor respondence  f i l e .my mai l  f rom John Smith  has  been added cothe text  c lass  budget  cor respondence .>amm-va i t  from my mai l  box.Bemove ic \[my mai l  f rom John Smith \ ]  f rom mymai l  box.my mai l  from John Smith  has been removedfrom your mail.>Create a budget  cor respondence  named BudgetPlansPlease enter  text :S ta f f  l eve l  budget  meet ing  on Wed. a t  3 inTom's o f f i ce .

Addinz New Obiect  Ty~esA l though the  ASK System has  been  des igned  toa l low the  add i t ion  o f  new ob jec t  types ,  th i s  canbe done on ly  by an app l i ca t ion  programmer .
Themajor  obs tac le  i s  the  necess i ty  to  p rov ide  aprocedure to init ial ize instances of the newobject type and procedures that carry out theirintrinsic manipulation.
However, we expect theaddit ion of new object types to be a commonoccurrence in the applications of the ASK System.In any potential appl icaion areas, using groupshave accumulations of data already structured inspecific ways and families of procedures that theyhave developed to manipulate these structures.
InASK, they can identify these data structures as anew object type, design simple syucax for them toinvoke their procedures, and thus embed theirfamilar objects and manipulations within the ASKEnglish dialect and within the same context asother associated aspects of their tasks.
Theclass, attr ibuted and relation constructionsbecome immediately available.21Ill.

Har r i s  Exper ience  w i th  ROBOTSeveral Contexts can be based on a g iven one,and one Context can be based on several, thus ahierarchical structure of Contexts can be realized.All Contexts are directly or indirectly based uponthe BASE Context, which contains the funct ionwords and grammar  of the ASK dialect of English,the mathematical and statistical capabilities, andthe word processor.C.
T~anspo~tabilitvIt is easy and fast to apply ASK to a newdomain, given that a data base for this new domainis avai lable in machine readable form.
Thevehicle is the  ASK dialogue-driven Bulk Data Inputcapabi l i ty,  which can be cal led upon to build anexisting database into one's Context.
The resultnot only integrates this new data with thatalready in the Context and under the ASK dialectof English, but in many c i rcumstances  wi l l  makethe use of this data more responsive to users"needs.The Bulk Data Input Dia logue prompts  the userfor necessary in format ion  to (i) estab l ish  thephys ica l  s t ruc ture  of the data  base to beincluded, (2) add necessary classes and attributesas needed for the new data entries.
The user alsoindicates, using Eng l i sh  const ruct ions ,  thein format ional  re lat ionships among the fields inthe physical  records of the database file thats/he wishes carried over to the ASK Context.IV.
DIALOGUES IN ASKSome have raised the question whether naturallanguage is always the most desirable medium for auser to communicate  with the computer.
Expertsystems, for example, have tended to use computerguided dialogues.
One simple form such a dialogue22might  take  i s  i l l us t ra ted  by the  fo l low ins  inwhich a new ent ry  i s  added to the  AI B ib l iography:>New b ib l iography  i tem>Add to what b ib l iography?

For example ,  in  pos i t ion ing  cargo inthe  ho ld  o f  a sh ip ,  one wou ld  l i ke  to  be ab le  tod i sp lay  the  par t i cu la r  cargo  space ,  showing  i t scur rent  cargo ,  and ca l l  fo r  and move in to  p laceo ther  i tems that  are  to be inc luded .In  the  past ,  enab l ing  the  sys tem to respondmore  in te l l igent ly  to  the  user ' s  needs  requ i redthe  prov is ion  o f  e laborate  programs s ince  theuser ' s  tasks  may be qu i te  invo lved ,  w i th  complexdec is ion  s t ruc tures .

In the  ASK System,  the usersthemse lves  can prov ide  th i s  knowledge.
They canins t ruc t  the  system on how to e l i c i t  the  necessaryin fo rmat ion  and how to complete  the  requ i red  task .This ASK capabil i ty is quite facile, opening theway fo r  i t s  ub iqu i tous  use  in  extend ing  theknowledgeab le  respons iveness  o f  the  computer  touser ' s  immedia te  needs .

Forms Desi~nin2 DialogueThe Form is an efficient means of communicationwith which we are all familiar.
A number ofcomputer systems include a Forms package.
Formost of these, however, filling in a Form resultsonly in a document; the Form does not constitute amedium for interacting with the knowledge base orcontrol l in K the actions of the system.
The ASKForms capabil ity enlarges the roles and ways inwhich Forms can be used as a medium for userinteraction.
As the user fills in the fields of aForm, the System can make use of the informationbeing supplied to (1) check its consistency withthe data already in the knowledge base and, ifnecessary ,  respond w i th  a d iagnost i c ,  (2) f i l l  ino ther  f ie lds  w i th  data  deve loped  f rom theknowledge  base ,  (3)  extend  the  knowledge  base ,add ing  to  the  vocabu lary  and add ing  or  chang ingthe  data  i t se l f ,  (4)  f i l e  the  completed  fo rm inp rescr ibed  f i l es  or  in  those  ind icated  by the  userand a l so  ma i l  it to a spec i f ied  d i s t r ibut ion  l i s tth rough the e lec t ron ic  ma i l  subsystem.

Our work is supported by theHewlett Packard Corporation, Desktop ComputerDivision.The user must provide the system with knowledgeof a particular cask; more precisely s/he mustprogram this knowledge into the system.
Theresult of this programming will be a system guideddialogue which the user can subsequently initiateand which will then elicit the necessary inputs.Using these inputs in con junct ion  with theknowledge already available, particularly the database, the system completes the task.
It is thissystem-guided dialogue chat the user needs to beable to des ign .In the ASK System, there is a special dialoguewhich can be used co design system guideddialogues Co accomplish particular casks.
We callthis the Dialogue Designing Dialogue (DDD).
UsingDDD, the user becomes a computer-aided designer.Since DDD, in conducting its dialogue with theuser, only requires simple responses or responsesphrased in ASK English, the user need have littleprogramming skill or experience.
Using DDD, theuser alone can replace a tedious, repetitive caskwith an efficient system guided dialogue, all in anatural language environment.
The ASK DialogueDesigning Dialogue constitutes a high level,24
