Five main tasks and three support-ing tasks were arranged, and their results showadvances in the state of the art in fine-grainedbiomedical domain information extraction anddemonstrate that extraction methods success-fully generalize in various aspects.1 IntroductionThe BioNLP Shared Task (BioNLP-ST, hereafter)series represents a community-wide move towardfine-grained information extraction (IE), in particu-lar biomolecular event extraction (Kim et al, 2009;Ananiadou et al, 2010).
The series is complemen-tary to BioCreative (Hirschman et al, 2007); whileBioCreative emphasizes the short-term applicabilityof introduced IE methods for tasks such as databasecuration, BioNLP-ST places more emphasis on themeasurability of the state-of-the-art and traceabil-ity of challenges in extraction through an approachmore closely tied to text.These goals were pursued in the first event,BioNLP-ST 2009 (Kim et al, 2009), through highquality benchmark data provided for system devel-opment and detailed evaluation performed to iden-tify remaining problems hindering extraction perfor-mance.
Also, as the complexity of the task was highand system development time limited, we encour-aged focus on fine-grained IE by providing gold an-notation for named entities as well as various sup-porting resources.
BioNLP-ST 2009 attracted wideattention, with 24 teams submitting final results.
Thetask setup and data since have served as the basisfor numerous studies (Miwa et al, 2010b; Poon andVanderwende, 2010; Vlachos, 2010; Miwa et al,2010a; Bjo?rne et al, 2010).As the second event of the series, BioNLP-ST2011 preserves the general design and goals of theprevious event, but adds a new focus on variabil-ity to address a limitation of BioNLP-ST 2009: thebenchmark data sets were based on the Genia corpus(Kim et al, 2008), restricting the community-wideeffort to resources developed by a single group fora small subdomain of molecular biology.
BioNLP-ST 2011 is organized as a joint effort of severalgroups preparing various tasks and resources, inwhich variability is pursued in three primary direc-tions: text types, event types, and subject domains.Consequently, generalization of fine grained bio-IEin these directions is emphasized as the main themeof the second event.This paper summarizes the entire BioNLP-ST2011, covering the relationships between tasks andsimilar broad issues.
Each task is presented in detailin separate overview papers and extraction systemsin papers by participants.12 Main tasksBioNLP-ST 2011 includes four main tracks (withfive tasks) representing fine-grained bio-IE.2.1 Genia task (GE)The GE task (Kim et al, 2011) preserves the taskdefinition of BioNLP-ST 2009, arranged based onthe Genia corpus (Kim et al, 2008).
The data repre-sents a focused domain of molecular biology: tran-scription factors in human blood cells.
The purposeof the GE task is two-fold: to measure the progressof the community since the last event, and to eval-uate generalization of the technology to full papers.For the second purpose, the provided data is com-posed of two collections: the abstract collection,identical to the BioNLP-ST 2009 data, and the newfull paper collection.
Progress on the task is mea-sured through the unchanged task definition and theabstract collection, while generalization to full pa-pers is measured on the full paper collection.
In thisway, the GE task is intended to connect the entireevent to the previous one.2.2 Epigenetics and post-translationalmodification task (EPI)The EPI task (Ohta et al, 2011) focuses on IE forprotein and DNA modifications, with particular em-phasis on events of epigenetics interest.
While thebasic task setup and entity definitions follow those ofthe GE task, EPI extends on the extraction targets bydefining 14 new event types relevant to task topics,including major protein modification types and theirreverse reactions.
For capturing the ways in whichdifferent entities participate in these events, the taskextends the GE argument roles with two new rolesspecific to the domain, Sidechain and Contextgene.The task design and setup are oriented toward theneeds of pathway extraction and curation for domaindatabases (Wu et al, 2003; Ongenaert et al, 2008)and are informed by previous studies on extractionof the target events (Ohta et al, 2010b; Ohta et al,2010c).2.3 Infectious diseases task (ID)The ID task (Pyysalo et al, 2011a) concerns the ex-traction of events relevant to biomolecular mecha-nisms of infectious diseases from full-text publica-tions.
The task follows the basic design of BioNLP-ST 2009, and the ID entities and extraction targetsare a superset of the GE ones.
The task extendsconsiderably on core entities, adding to PROTEINfour new entity types, including CHEMICAL andORGANISM.
The events extend on the GE defini-tions in allowing arguments of the new entity typesas well as in introducing a new event category forhigh-level biological processes.
The task was im-plemented in collaboration with domain experts andinformed by prior studies on domain information ex-traction requirements (Pyysalo et al, 2010; Anani-adou et al, 2011), including the support of systemssuch as PATRIC (http://patricbrc.org).2.4 Bacteria trackThe bacteria track consists of two tasks, BB and BI.2.4.1 Bacteria biotope task (BB)The aim of the BB task (Bossy et al, 2011) is to ex-tract the habitats of bacteria mentioned in textbook-level texts written for non-experts.
The texts areWeb pages about the state of the art knowledge aboutbacterial species.
BB targets general relations, Lo-calization and PartOf , and is challenging in thattexts contain more coreferences than usual, habitatreferences are not necessarily named entities, and,unlike in other BioNLP-ST 2011 tasks, all entitiesneed to be recognized by participants.
BB is the firsttask to target phenotypic information and, as habi-tats are yet to be normalized by the field community,presents an opportunity for the BioNLP communityto contribute to the standardization effort.2.4.2 Bacteria interaction task (BI)The BI task (Jourde et al, 2011) is devoted to the ex-traction of bacterial molecular interactions and reg-ulations from publication abstracts.
Mainly focusedon gene transcriptional regulation in Bacillus sub-tilis, the BI corpus is provided to participants withrich semantic annotation derived from a recentlyproposed ontology (Manine et al, 2009) definingten entity types such as gene, protein and deriva-tives as well as DNA sites/motifs.
Their interactionsare described through ten relation types.
The BIcorpus consists of the sentences of the LLL corpus(Ne?dellec, 2005), provided with manually checkedlinguistic annotations.2Task Text Focus #GE abstracts, full papers domain (HT) 9EPI abstracts event types 15ID full papers domain (TCS) 10BB web pages domain (BB) 2BI abstracts domain (BS) 10Table 1: Characteristics of BioNLP-ST 2011 main tasks.?#?
: number of event/relation types targeted.
Domains:HT = human transcription factors in blood cells, TCS= two-component systems, BB = bacteria biology, BS =Bacillus subtilis2.5 Characteristics of main tasksThe main tasks are characterized in Table 1.
Fromthe text type perspective, BioNLP-ST 2011 gener-alizes from abstracts in 2009 to full papers (GE andID) and web pages (BB).
It also includes data collec-tions for a variety of specific subject domains (GE,ID, BB an BI) and a task (EPI) whose scope is notdefined through a domain but rather event types.
Interms of the target event types, ID targets a supersetof GE events and EPI extends on the representationfor PHOSPHORYLATION events of GE.
The two bac-teria track tasks represent an independent perspec-tive relatively far from other tasks in terms of theirtarget information.3 Supporting tasksBioNLP-ST 2011 includes three supporting tasksdesigned to assist in primary the extraction tasks.Other supporting resources made available to par-ticipants are presented in (Stenetorp et al, 2011).3.1 Protein coreference task (CO)The CO task (Nguyen et al, 2011) concerns therecognition of coreferences to protein references.
Itis motivated from a finding from BioNLP-ST 2009result analysis: coreference structures in biomedicaltext hinder the extraction results of fine-grained IEsystems.
While finding connections between eventtriggers and protein references is a major part ofevent extraction, it becomes much harder if one isreplaced with a coreferencing expression.
The COtask seeks to address this problem.
The data sets forthe task were produced based on MedCO annotation(Su et al, 2008) and other Genia resources (Tateisiet al, 2005; Kim et al, 2008).Event Date NoteSample Data 31 Aug. 2010Support.

The task is motivated by specific chal-lenges: the identification of the components of pro-teins in text is relevant e.g.
to the recognition ofSite arguments (cf.
GE, EPI and ID tasks), and re-lations between proteins and their complexes rele-vant to any task involving them.
REL setup is in-formed by recent semantic relation tasks (Hendrickxet al, 2010).
The task data, consisting of new anno-tations for GE data, extends a previously introducedresource (Pyysalo et al, 2009; Ohta et al, 2010a).3.3 Gene renaming task (REN)The REN task (Jourde et al, 2011) objective is to ex-tract renaming pairs of Bacillus subtilis gene/proteinnames from PubMed abstracts, motivated by dis-crepancies between nomenclature databases that in-terfere with search and complicate normalization.REN relations partially overlap several concepts:explicit renaming mentions, synonymy, and renam-ing deduced from biological proof.
While the taskis related to synonymy relation extraction (Yu andAgichtein, 2003), it has a novel definition of renam-ing, one name permanently replacing the other.4 ScheduleTable 2 shows the task schedule, split into twophases to allow the use of supporting task results inaddressing the main tasks.
In recognition of theirhigher complexity, a longer development period wasarranged for the main tasks (3 months vs 7 weeks).3Team GE EPI ID BB BI CO REL RENUTurku 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1ConcordU 1 1 1 1 1 1UMass 1 1 1Stanford 1 1 1FAUST 1 1 1MSR-NLP 1 1CCP-BTMG 1 1Others 8 0 2 2 0 4 2 1SUM 15 7 7 3 1 6 4 3Table 3: Final submissions to BioNLP-ST 2011 tasks.5 ParticipationBioNLP-ST 2011 received 46 submissions from 24teams (Table 3).
While seven teams participated inmultiple tasks, only one team, UTurku, submitted fi-nal results to all the tasks.
The remaining 17 teamsparticipated in only single tasks.
Disappointingly,only two teams (UTurku, and ConcordU) performedboth supporting and main tasks, and neither usedsupporting task analyses for the main tasks.6 ResultsDetailed evaluation results and analyses are pre-sented in individual task papers, but interesting ob-servations can be obtained also by comparisons overthe tasks.
Table 4 summarizes best results for vari-ous criteria (Note that the results shown for e.g.
GEa,GEf and GEp may be from different teams).The community has made a significant improve-ment in the repeated GE task, with an over 10%reduction in error from ?09 to GEa.
Three teamsachieved better results than M10, the best previouslyreported individual result on the ?09 data.
This in-dicates a beneficial role from focused efforts likeBioNLP-ST.
The GEf and ID results show thatgeneralization to full papers is feasible, with verymodest loss in performance compared to abstracts(GEa).
The results for PHOSPHORYLATION eventsin GE and EPI are comparable (GEp vs EPIp), withthe small drop for the EPI result, suggesting thatthe removal of the GE domain specificity does notcompromise extraction performance.
EPIc resultsindicate some challenges in generalization to simi-lar event types, and EPIf suggest substantial furtherchallenges in additional argument extraction.
Thecomplexity of ID is comparable to GE, also reflectedto their final results, which further indicate success-Task Evaluation ResultsBioNLP-ST 2009 (?09) 46.73 / 58.48 / 51.95Miwa et al (2010b) (M10) 48.62 / 58.96 / 53.29LLL 2005 (LLL) 53.00 / 55.60 / 54.30GE abstracts (GEa) 50.00 / 67.53 / 57.46GE full texts (GEf) 47.84 / 59.76 / 53.14GE PHOSPHORYLATION (GEp) 79.26 / 86.99 / 82.95GE LOCALIZATION (GEl) 37.88 / 77.42 / 50.87EPI full task (EPIf) 52.69 / 53.98 / 53.33EPI core task (EPIc) 68.51 / 69.20 / 68.86EPI PHOSPHORYLATION (EPIp) 86.15 / 74.67 / 80.00ID full task (IDf) 48.03 / 65.97 / 55.59ID core task (IDc) 50.62 / 66.06 / 57.32BB 45.00 / 45.00 / 45.00BB PartOf (BBp) 32.00 / 83.00 / 46.00BI 71.00 / 85.00 / 77.00CO 22.18 / 73.26 / 34.05REL 50.10 / 68.00 / 57.70REN 79.60 / 95.90 / 87.00Table 4: Best results for various (sub)tasks (recall / preci-sion / f-score (%)).

The BB task isin part comparable to GEl and involves a represen-tation similar to REL, with lower results likely inpart because BB requires entity recognition.
The BItask is comparable to LLL Challenge, though BI in-volves more entity and event types.
The BI resultis 20 points above the LLL best result, indicating asubstantial progress of the community in five years.7 Discussion and ConclusionsMeeting with wide participation from the commu-nity, BioNLP-ST 2011 produced a wealth of valu-able resources for the advancement of fine-grainedIE in biology and biomedicine, and demonstratedthat event extraction methods can successfully gen-eralize to new text types, event types, and domains.However, the goal to observe the capacity of sup-porting tasks to assist the main tasks was not met.The entire shared task period was very long, morethan 6 months, and the complexity of the task washigh, which could be an excessive burden for partic-ipants, limiting the application of novel resources.There have been ongoing efforts since BioNLP-ST2009 to develop IE systems based on the task re-sources, and we hope to see continued efforts alsofollowing BioNLP-ST 2011, especially exploringthe use of supporting task resources for main tasks.4ReferencesSophia Ananiadou, Sampo Pyysalo, Junichi Tsujii, andDouglas B.
