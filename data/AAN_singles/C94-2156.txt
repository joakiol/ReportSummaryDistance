Bell Laboratories, 600 Monntain Avenue, Murray llill, N.J. 07974evelyne@research.att.comAbstractThis paper presents the results of an experimentusiug machine-readable dictionaries (Mill)s) andcorpora for building concatenativc units for textto speech (T'PS) systems.
Theoretical questionsconcerning the nature of t)honemic data in dic-tionaries are raised; phonemic dictionary data isviewed as a representative corpus over which toextract n- gram phonemic frequencies in the lan-guage.
Dictionary data are compared to corpusdata, and phoneme inventories arc evaluated forcoverage.
A methodology is defined to computeI)honemic n-grams for incorporation into a TTSsystem.1 IntroductionThe majority of speech synthesis systems usetwo techniques: concatenation and formant-synthesis.
Building a comprehensive and intelli-gible concatenative-based peech synthesis ystemrelies heavily on the successfid choice of concate-native units.
Our results contribute to the t~sk ofdeveloping an eificient and elfective methodologyfor reducing the potentially large set of concaten-live units to a manageable size, and to chosing theoptimal set for recording and storage.The paper is aimed primarily at two audiences:one consists of those concerned with research onthe automatic use of MR.D data; the other areTTS system designers who require linguistic andlcxicographic resources to improve and streamlinesystem-building.
Issues of morphological nalysisand generation, as well as stress assigmnent basedon dictiona.ry data, are discussed.2 Using MRDs in Text toSpeechSeveral problems are addressed in this paper;one concerns tile subtle comple?itics and idiosyn-crasies ilwolved iu parsing dictionaries and ex-tracting data.
Added to this is the lack of consis-tency both within the same dictionary and acrossdictionaries which often requires ad hoc proce-dures for each- resource.
Another issue relates totile structure of the modules of a TTS system,specifically ill the grapheme-to-phoneme compo-nent; dictionary lookup depends on several factorsincluding size, machine power and storage, factorsthat have important consequences for the extrac-tion ofconcatenative nnits.
Another considerationconcerns tile nature of the language itself: a lan-guage with irregular graphcme4o-phoneme ap-ping and lexically determined stress assignment(such as English) benefits rnost from the large ex-ception list which a dictionary can provide, Thereis also the practical issue of dictionary availabil-ity, and of pronunciation field accuracy within anavailable dictionary.
Thus, decisions on the useof MRD data depend on many factors, and cansignificantly impact efficiency and accuracy of aspeech system.Since a dictionary entry consists of severalfields of information, naturally, each will bc use-rid for different applications \[1\].
Among the stan-dard fields are prommciation, etymology, sub-jcct field notes, definition fields, synonym andantonym cross references, semantic and syntacticcomments, run-on forms, conjugational class andinflectional information where relevant, and trans-lation for the I)ilingual dictionaries.
Each of thesefields has proven usefifl for different applications,such as for building semantic taxouomies \[3\], \[13\]and machine translation \[12\].
The most directlyuseflfl for TTS is the pronunciation field \[4\], \[11\].Equally usefifl for TTS, but less dir6ctly acces-971sible, are data from run-on fields, conjugationalclass information, and part-of-speech.
1To illustrate, the following partial entries fromWebster's Seventh (W7) \[15\] il lustrate typical pro-nunciation, definition, and run-on fields:(l) ha.yen/ 'h.~-v0n/  1: IIAnBOR, POLO' 2 : aplace of safety : ASYLUM haven vt(2) bi.son/'brs-on, 't>iz-/ n ...(3) ho.m,,.ge.neous /-'j~-ne-0s,-ny0s/ ...(4) den.tic.u.late/den-'tik-y0-1~t/ orden.t ic .u.
lat .ed/- , lat -od/  a jThe entry for "haven" contains one fnll pronun-ciation.
The entry for "bison" has one alterna-tive, but the user must figure out that the /on/should be appended after 't)\]z-/, as in the first pro-mmciation, in order to obtain the correct varia-tion.
Correct pronunciation for "homogeneous"relies on the pronunciation of the previous en-try, "homogeneity" , and requires the user to sep-arate and bring the prefix "homo-" from one en-try to another.
To complicate matters, the alter-native pronunciation for the suffix /n6.-as/-nyas/must also be correctly interpreted by the user.
Fi-nally, "dentieulate" has a morphologically relatedrun-on form "denticulated" in tile early part ofthe entry, and the pronunciation of that run-on isrelated to the main entry, but the user must de-cide how to strip and append the given syllables.2 While these types of reasoning are not difficultfor humans, for whom the dictionary was written,they are quite difficult for programs, and thus arenot straighforward to perform automatically.2.1 Using the MRD pronunciationfieldExtracting the prommciation field from an MRD isone of the most obvious uses of a dictionary.
Nev-ertheless, parsing dictionaries in general can be avery complex operation (\[16\]) and even the extrac-tion of one field, such as prommciation, can poseproblems.
Similar to W7, in the Robert Frenchdictionary \[9\], which contains about 89,000 entries,several pronunciations can be given for a head-word and the choice of one must be made.
More-over, because of the rich morphology of French1 Notice, however, that the fifll Collins Spanish-Englishdictionary \[7\], as opposed to the other bilinguals, does notcontain any prommciatlon i formation.
Although this israther surprising taking into account that the smaller ver-si .

.phonetic field, it could be attributed to the fact that pro-mmciation miles in Spanish are relatively predictable.\[2\] reports on the need to resyllablfy entries already syl-labified in LDOCE \[18\], since syllable boundaries for writ-ten forms usually reflect hyphenation conventions, ratherthan phonologically motivated syllabification conventionsnecessary for pronunciation.which has a rough ratio of eight morphologicallyinflected words for one baseform, Robert lists onlythe non-inflected forms of the lexical entries.
Itow-ever, if pronunciation varies during inflection ofnouns and adjectives, the pronunciation field re-flects that variation which makes the informationdifficult to extract automatically.
For example, in(5) and (6), one needs to know the nature of therule to apply in order to relate both forms of theadjective.
(5) b lanc ,  b lanche/b l~,  blbJ ' /adj ,  et n.(6) vif, r i ve /v i f ,  v iv /ad j ,  et n.In (5), the mascu l ine /b l~/ i s  obtained by remov-ing the phoneme /J ' /  from the feminine /bl~,j'/(blanche, "white" ).
In (6), the form masculinefo rnr /v i f / ( "sharp ,  qnick") is formed by strippingthe affix /ve /  and substituting the phoneme / f / .Notice that tile rules are different in nature, thefirst being a addition/deletion relation, and thesecond being a substitution.In this project, the dictionary pronunciationfield was used to start building the phonetic inven-tory of a speech synthesis ystem.
For the FrenchTTS system \[?\], the set of diphones was estab-lished by taking most of the thirty-flve phonemesfor French and coupling them with each other (352= 1225 pairs).
Then, the diphones were extractedfrom the pronunciation field for headwords in theRobert dictionary.
A program was written tosearch through the dictionary phonetic field andselect the longest word where the phoneme pairswould be in mid-syllable position.
For example,the phonemic pa i r / lo /was  found in the pronun-ciation f ield/zoolo3ik/corresponding to the head-word zoologiquc "zoologic.
"Out of 1225 phonemic pairs, 874 words werefonnd with at least one occurence of the pair.The pair \[headword_orth, headword_phon\] was ex-tracted and headword_orth was placed in a carriersentence for recording.
For instance, the speakerwould utter the following sentence: "C'est zo-ologique que je dis" where "C'est ... que je dis"is the carrier sentence.
Due to the lack of explicitinflectional information for nmms and adjectives,only the non-inflected forms of the entries were ex-tracted during dictionary lookup for building tilediphone table.
Similarly for verbs, only the infini-tive forms were used since the dictionary does notlist the inflected forms as headwords.
This exem-plifies the most simple way to use pronunciationfield data, which we have completed.
A pronun-ciation list of around 85,796 phonetic words wasobtained from the original ist of ahnost 89,000 en-tries, i.e.
96% of the entries.
The remaining 4%consist primarily of prefixes and suffixes which arelisted in the dictionary without pronunciations,972and which should not be used in isolation in artyease.2.2  Us ing  the  MRD fo r  morpho logyEven though an MRI) may not list complete in-tlectional paradigms, it contains useful inflectionalinformation.
For example in the Collins Spanish-English dictionary, verb entries are listed with anindex pointing to the conjugation chess and table,listed at the end of the dictionary.
Using this infermation, a finite-state transducer for morphologicalanalysis and generation was built for Spanish \[20\].From the original list of over 50,000 words, a fewmillion words have been generated.
These formscan then be used as tile input to the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion module, in ;t Spanish TTSsystem.2.3 Using Run-on'sA run-on is defined as a morphological variant ofa headword, included in the entry.
Run-on's areproblematic data in MRI)s \[16\], and they can befound nearly anywhere in the entry.
In example(4), the run-on occurs at the beginning of the en-try, and consists of a fitll form with suffix.
Morecommonly, run-on's occur towards the end of theentry, and tend to consist of predictable suttixa-tion, that is, class II or neutral suttixes \[19\] , suchas :hess, dy, or -er, ~s in:(7) sharp  adj .... sharp.
ly  adv sharp.hess n(8) suc.ces.s ion n .... suc.ces.s ion.al  adjsnc.ces.s ion.al .

ly/d-k(a-) le/  advThe run-on form with part-of-speech is given in.-side the entry, so it could be used for morphologi.-eel analysis, tIowever, since proton|elation is usu-ally predictable from the headword (i.e.
there isusually no stress change, and if there is a change,this is explicitly indicated) the run-on pronuncia-tion often consists of a truncated form, requiringsome logic for reconstruction of the entire pronun-ciation.
Again, this may be obvious to the humanuser, but rather complex to tigure out by l)rogram.
'l'hus, the run-on may be nsefld for Inorpl|ology,but is not ms useful h)r automatic pronunciationextraction.3 Methodo logy  and  Resu l t s3.1 Collecting DataAs stated al)ove, out of ahnost 89,000 headwordsin the dictionary, 874 phonemic pairs,which repre-sents 71% of the total, were found.
This is due tothe fact that (a) the lookup occurs only on non:inflected words, thus a limited sample of the lan-guage, (b) because the dictionary consists of a listof isolated words, it does not aceonnt for inter:word boundary phenomena.
Sitme French liaisonplays such all important role in tile phonology ofFrench, a look at phonetic data from a corpus mnstbe giw'n in order to achieve fnll coverage.
A pertion of the llansard French corpus (over 2.3 millionwords) wa.s used h)r this purpose.
Graplmme-to-phoneme software \[14\] was utilized in order to con-vert l"rench orthography into phonemes.
For thesake of comparison, both the phonetic transcrip:tion from the corpus and the one from the MRI)were converted into a unique set of i)honemes.Typical outt>ut front the dictionary looks like:ABACA \[abaka\] n. m.ABASOURI)IR \[abazuRdiR,\]; \[abasuRdiR\]AI~ASOUR1)ISSANT, ANTI" \[abazu RdisA, AtAI~NI"I'EUt{, EUSE \[abat8R, 7z\] n.ABCE'S \[absE; apsE\] n. m.ABDOMINAL, ALE, AUX \[abd>minal, el adj.ABI)OMINO-ABDUCTION \[abdyksjO\] n. f.A small sample of the tlansard followed by tileascii transcription is shown below:l)re'sident de la Compagnie d'Ame',mgement dubarreau de.X Monsieur X I)e'pute' anrien Ministre Pre'sidentdu Conseil.prezidA d& la kOpaNi d amenaZmA dy bare d&iks m&sju dis depyte Asjl ministr prezid dy kOsEjAs all experhnent, we compared triphones ex-tracted fronl dictionary data and corpora.

The levels of common-ality between the triphones of the tIansard and thedictionary (5% of commonality for the top 100 tri-phones and 15% of commonality for the top 1000triphones) is interesting to observe.Hansard  data54580 ~O 3874553948 jO* 3870747339 par 3505244328 asj 3038944065 prL 3972243288 tr~ 2909341356 &la 2878440877 put 2676639122 ~mA 2599738707 d&l 25378*z&setk>m*mEre*&pristEatHIA*Rober t  data3636 mA* 17253324 ik* 15543223 jO* 14922823 sjO 14622597 te* 14052202 *de 13912105 5sj 13892086 EFt* 13762067 aZ* 13411789 ist 1321Table 1: Twenty most frequent riphonesThe preliminary results indicate that the coar-ticulatory effects derived from the corpus data willbe usefnl, in particular for languages like Frenchwhere liaison plays a major role.
This remains tobe tested in the TTS system.3.2 Related WorkAlthough the statistical analysis of MRDs has fo-cussed primarily on definitions and translations,\[5\] used the prommciation field as data.
A dic-tionary of over 110,000 entries containing 51,219common words and 59,625 proper nouns, \[17\] wasused for selecting candidate units that were fur-ther utilized in the set of concatenative units (di-phones, triphones, and longer milts) for synthe-sis.
The phonemic string was split accordingto ten language-dependent segmentation princi-ples.
For example, the word "abacus" \['ab-o-kos\]was first transformed into cuttable units as fol-lows: \[#'a,'~b,bo,ok,ko,os,s#\].
Once each dictio-nary word was split, the duplicates were removedand the remaining units formed the set of con-catenative units.
At the end of this operation, arather long list was obtained that was pruned bymethods uch as reduction of secondary and pri-mary stress into one stress in order to keep onlyone +stress/-stress distinction.
Techniques wereshown that allow the selection of a minimal setof word pairs for inter-word junctures; every can-didate unit inside and across word sequence wasincluded.
The same strategy was replicated on theCollins Spanish-English dictionary by \[6\].
In thisfashion, the dictionary was used as a sample of thelanguage in the sense that it assnmes that most ofthe phonemic ombinations of the language werepresent.i81Hiteje*8111"bl*Miabltikst*4 L imi ta t ions  o f  MRDsThe most straightforward way, but in the longrun not the nlost flexible, is to parse the phoneticinformation out of the prommciation field.
The)ronunciation field information can generally be~onsulted by a TTS system within the grapheme-;o-phoneme module.
Additional rules for pro-:esses such as inter-word assimilation, juncture,md prosodic contouring need to be added, sincesolated word pronunciation couhl already be ban-tied by look-up table.
Although appealing, there~re two major drawbacks to this approach:(a) dictionary pronunciation fields are often not)honetically fine-grained enough for acceptablespeech output.
For example, the pronunciationfor "inquest" is given ill W7 as /'in-,kwest/, butof course the nasal will assimilate in place to thevelar, giving /i0-kwest/.
Without assimilation,the perceptual cffect is of two words: "in quest"and would be misleading.
Again, the human userwill a.ssimilatc naturally, but a text to speech sys-tem must figure out such details, since artieulatoryease is not a factor in most synthesis ystems.
Oneway to solve this problem is to impose such assim-ilation on input from the pronunciation field bya set of post-processing rules.
Although this so-lution wouht be correct in the majority of cases,blanket application of such rules is not always ap-propriate for lexical exceptions.
For example, as-similation is optional for words like "uncaring",in this case related to the morphological structureof the lexical item.
A TTS system will proba-bly already have snch rules since they are inher-ent in the graphemc-to-phoneme approach.
Thus,it could be argued that there is no need for thedictionary prommciation, since with a completeand comprehensive grapheme-to-phoneme conver-sion system, a list which requires post-processingis simply inadequate and unnecessary.
Tiffs is theapproach taken, for example, by \[14\], who makesuse of small word l ists (the main dictionary being25K stored forms) and several affix tables to recog-nize graphemic forms, which arc then transformedinto phonemic reprcsentations;(b) only a small percentage of possible wordsare listed with prommciations in a dictionary.
Forexample, Wcbster's Sevcnth contains about 70,000headwords, but is missing words like "computer-ize" and "computerization" since they came intofrequent use in the language after the 1963 publi-cation date.
Two solutions to this problem presentthemselves.
One is to expand the word list fromtile dictionary to include run-on's, as illustrated inexamples (3) and (4), and discussed in Section 2.3.The other is to build a morphological generator,974using headwords, part  of sl)eech , and other in-format ion as input, discussed in Section 2.2 thatwould be invoked when the word does not tigurein tl,e headword list.5 F ina l  RemarksAlthough l imitat ions ('lcarly constrain the use ofMRI)s in TTS, we have demonstrated in this pa-per that  it is more cost eflqcient to post processunderspecilie(l dict ionary information such as in-flection, pronunciat ion, and part-of-speech, ratherthan generate rules from scratch to arrive at thesame end point.
For speech synthesis, thc datais not always perfect, and often must be post-processed.
This paper h~us demonstrated ways wehave successfully used dictionary data in 'FTS sys-tems, ways wc have post-processed data to makeit morc useful, and ways data Camlot bc easilypost-processed or used.Of course, for any TTS system, the power ofthe dict ionary data can be found at the lexical,t)hrmqal, and idiom level.
Although any wordlist such ,-Ls a dictionary is by definition closed,whereas language is open-ended, dictionary datahas proven to be usefid from both a theoreticaland practical point of view.References\[1\] Branimir \]loguraev, Roy Byrd, Judith Klavans,anti Mary Neff.
