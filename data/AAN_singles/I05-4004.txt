However, there is no uniformspecification for defining and process-ing metadata in Chinese corpus nowa-days.
This paper introduces ametadata system we?ve proposed forChinese corpus.
46 elements are de-fined in all, which can be divided into 6classes: information about copyright,information about background of lin-guistic material creator, informationabout medium of linguistic material,information about the content of lin-guistic material, information aboutcollecting linguistic material, and in-formation about management of lin-guistic material.
To distinguish oneelement from another, or our elementsfrom someone else?s, we provide a po-tent description method, where 10 sub-sections are designed to describe thedetailed properties for each element.1 Introduction?Metadata?
is first defined in computer science.It plays an important role in the management ofelectronic resources, especially the huge infor-mation from Internet.
By cataloguing the webpages, we can obtain a better search more effi-ciently.
Nowadays, metadata becomes a populartool to describe administrative information aboutall kinds of resources.
It defines schemes forresource description, and also provides universalmechanism for resource retrieval.In corpus linguistic, metadata description hasexisted for a long time, and is generally referredto heading information.
By defining metadata,more accurate and profuse annotation contentscan be provided for corpus, such as, informationabout time, area, author and etc.
However, thereis no uniform specification for processing meta-data in Chinese corpus at present.
Thus, we de-fine a core metadata set for Chinese corpus andnormalize the description of set element.
Basingon the Dublin Core metadata, which is widelyaccepted in philology, the definition takes muchattention on the linguistic characteristics of Chi-nese corpus, and is compatible to the OLACmetadata standards as well.
Both creator andusers of the corpus can get regulations of textualdescription and annotation strategy from thisstandard.In section 2, we discuss some referencedstandards and resources, including DC andOLAC metadata.
Section 3 presents a frame-work within which we design our metadata, andlists the main problems to be solved.
Section 4summarizes our metadata description and re-ports some further development of the standard.Conclusion is drawn in section 5.2 Related metadata resources2.1 Dublin Core metadataDublin Core Metadata has been present inOCLC?NCSA ?National Center for Super-computer Applications?
Meta Workshop in1995.It?s a standard for cross-domain informa-tion resource description, and has no fundamen-tal restrictions to the types of resources to whichthe metadata can be assigned.
DC metadata de-fined 15 core elements, which are maintainedand managed by DCMI (Dublin Core MetadataInitiative).
The core elements are listed in table1.24In DC metadata, each element is described in10 property items that defined in ISO/IEC11179.They are: ?Name?, ?Identifier?, ?Ver-sion?, ?Registration Authority?, ?Language?,?Definition?, ?Obligation?, ?Datatype?, ?Maxi-mum Occurrence?
and ?Comment?.
However, 6items among them have settled value for eachelement as following:Version:1.1Registration Authority: Dublin Core Meta-data InitiativeLanguage:enObligation: OptionalDatatype: Character StringMaximum Occurrence: UnlimitedElementsabout Re-source Con-tentElementsabout Copy-rightElementsabout ExternalAttribute de-scriptionTitle Creator DateSubject Publisher TypeDescription Contributor FormatLanguage Rights IdentifierSourceRelation&RYHUDJHTable 1 Fifteen core elements in DC,which are divided into 3 classes.DC metadata is an important reference forthe definition of Chinese corpus metadata.
Thereare at least two reasons for this.
(1) Both DC and corpus metadata are designedfor large-scale users, who are not always pro-fessional catalogue person.
Thus apprehensi-ble and general are two pivotal aims toachieve.
(2) DC metadata has been mostly assigned toelectronic text from Internet webs, which areprimary source of linguistic material as well.Therefore, it?s expected that the corpus can beused directly without reannotation if they areannotated with DC metadata before.2.2 OLAC metadataThe OLAC?Open Language Archives Com-munity Metadata?metadata set is based on theDublin Core metadata set.
In order to meet thespecific needs of the language archiving com-munity, the OLAC metadata set qualifies withthree kinds of qualification: element refinement,encoding scheme, and content language.
Withthese three attributes, an element in OLAC canindicate more information than the same one inDC does.
Take the element ?Date?
in OLAC forexample, with the element refinement, it canrepresent either date of create, or date of issue,or date of modification in different occasionsThe elements in OLAC are listed in table2,and we can see that it uses all the 15 elementsin DC.
Element in OLAC are described in 5property items which are ?Name?, ?Definition?,?Comments?, ?

It?s designed for analyzingmodern Chinese.
Texts are collected from dif-ferent areas and classified according to five cri-teria: genre, style, mode, topic, and source.25Therefore, this corpus is a representative sampleof modern Chinese language.Metadata in Sinica corpus lays special emphasison describing the linguistics information of lin-guistic material, such as ?Mode?, ?Style?, ?Me-dium?, and ?Topic?.
An example of metadatadescribing in Sinica corpus is  given in table 3.2.3.2 National modern Chinese corpus meta-dataNational modern Chinese corpus is the largestbalance corpus in China at present.
The selec-tion of linguistic material follows the principlesof commonality, description and practicability.In order to reflect the panorama of modern Chi-nese, a lot of work has been done on designingbalance gene.
And the finally selected sampleshave a wide span on time, domain and medium.Metadata in National modern Chinese corpuspay much attention on copyright informationand publish information of linguistic material.Furthermore, both a global serial number and acategory number are designed to identify a cer-tain sample.2.3.3 BNC metadataThe British National Corpus (BNC) is a 100million word collection of samples of writtenand spoken language from a wide range ofsources, designed to represent a wide cross-section of current British English, both spokenand written.
Each text in BNC has a TEI headerto indicate the identification and classification ofindividual text, special details such as speakers?,and the housekeeping information.
The defini-tion of text classification is meticulous.
For spo-ken text material, age, sex, and class ofrespondent are all make sense as well as the do-main, region and type of the content.
And forwritten text material classification, age, sex, typeof author, audience, circulation, status, medium,and domain are laid emphasis on.
However,some classification were still poorly defined andpartially populated, such a ?dating?
(date of copyor date of first publication?)
and ?domain?
(hassomething different with text-type?
).2.3.4 Metadata in balanced corpusIn recent years, the awareness that text is notjust text, but that texts comes in several forms,has spread from more theoretical and literarysubfields of linguistics to the more practicallyoriented information retrieval and natural lan-guage processing fields.
As a consequence, sev-eral test collections available for researchexplicitly attempt to cover many or most well-established textual genres, or functional styles inwell-balanced proportionsIn practice, choosing balance gene is a profes-sional work that needs a scientific programmingstrategy.
Sinclair suggested a minimum set ofbalance gene for general corpus in 1991 thatindicates a popular classify principle for linguis-tic: the style of linguistic (on-the-spot record orliterature); the form of linguistic (formal or in-formal); the medium type of linguistic (frombook or magazine or paper); and the age, sex ofthe author.
From the Sinica corpus and Nationalmodern Chinese corpus we?ve discussed above,we can see that the gene of time, style, area andsubject are most in frequent use, which becomeour crucial reference for metadata designing.2.4 ISO1179 standardISO1179 is an international standard about de-veloping metadata.
There are 6 parts in thisstandard, which are considered as our basic ruleto follow.3 Framework of metadata descriptionWe describe metadata information from threeaspects, which we consider as: content structure,syntax structure and semantic structure.
Contentstructure is used to decide the elements in ametadata set.
Syntax structure introduces amodel or syntax to represent metadata, whilesemantic structure declares the significationconcourse of elements.FIG.1.The framework of develop metadataA consistent strategy is essential when thesethree structures are used to define metadata.
Ourresearch is to solve three problems especially.3.1 Element selectionElements in metadata set are used to describe aresource from different aspects.
Thus, the selec-tion or designing of elements becomes an impor-tant issue.
When the selection depends on the26experience of corpus creator rather than a nor-mative rule, it?s hard for the metadata to assertthe resource sufficiently.We referenced a lot from DC and OLACmetadata.
For the universal use of these twometadata standards and the similarity betweenDC metadata and corpus metadata we discussabove, we finally used all the fifteen elementsdefined in DC standard.
However, some ele-ments are refined or splitted into several newelements on the basis of the old definition.
Forexample, the elements ?Date?
is extended as?Indite Date?, ?Issued Date?, ?Created Date?and ?Modified Date?, thus more detailed anddefinite information of date can be obtained foreither a single sample or the whole corpus.
Andthe same case for the element ?Language?
fromDC.
We defined three kinds of informationabout language to describe both creator informa-tion and content information.To fully consider the linguistic characteristicsof Chinese corpus, we?ve introduced severalpopular metadata elements in balanced corpus,such as style, mode, medium and so on, whichare also important balance gene for corpus de-signing.Therefore, we define 46 elements in all,which can be divided into 6 classes.
They are:information about copyright, information aboutbackground of linguistic material creator, infor-mation about medium of linguistic material, in-formation about the content of linguisticmaterial, information about collecting linguisticmaterial, and information about management oflinguistic material.
Most elements we definedare intellectual metadata, while some structuralmetadata, access control metadata and criticalmetadata are included as well.3.2 Description fieldMetadata is structured data about data.
It?s usu-ally expressed with several property fields orsubsections, which is regarded as its own datastructure or syntax.
Different metadata systemmay use different way to describe and namingits elements, thus it?s hard for metadata com-munion or understanding the same element fromtwo dissimilar systems.A unified method for description is helpful,and it?s expected to be succinct, general and dis-tinguished.
Our standard has provided 10 fieldsfor a metadata description.
Some are obligatory,that is to say you must give a value to suchfields in order to confirm an element.
And someare optional for the individuation use.
Thisseems to do a better work than DC, while 6fields in it always have settled value.
We spe-cially introduce two subsections for naming anelement, thus elements can be distinguished ex-actly from either ?Name?
or ?Long Name?
field.We have exhibited such format in XML (eXten-sible Markup Language), and created the DTD(Document Type Definition) file for it as well.3.3 Semantic descriptionSemantic structure defines the detailed value ofmetadata, and finally affirms how to use it.Value land should be carefully considered toavoid confusion use.
Many famous metadatastandards have formed a maturity definition ofelements.
For example, DC use ISO 8601 to de-fine element ?date?, Dublin Core Types for ele-ment ?Resource Type?
and URL or ISBN todefine element ?Identifier?.
We took much ac-count of the linguistic characteristics of Chinesecorpus and some value are assigned refer to lin-guistics literature.4 Metadata standard4.1 Element setOur corpus metadata set is based on the DublinCore metadata set and uses all fifteen elementsdefined in that standard.
We?ve summarizedsome annotation items in other large-scale cor-pus and developed an element set listed in table4.There are 46 elements in all.
They are ex-pected to describe the resources from six aspects.4.1.1 Information about copyrightThe intellectual property right of corpus is copy-right.
According to the copyright law, corpusmust show clearly its copyright informationwhen being published or promulgated.
Metadatain this class is about corpus?
created or issuedinformation, mainly including:?Title: the title of original linguistic material,such as books, articles, webs and so on.
?Source Identifier: the tag of source linguis-tic material, such as ISBN for books andURL for webs.
? Indite Date: is used to describe the writingtime of original linguistic material, or the27recording time of the oral linguistic mate-rial.
? Issued Date: describe the publish time of agiven linguistic material.
?Copyright: show the composer, publishingcompany or the web site of the original lin-guistic material.
?Resource Type: resource?s physical typecan be various, such as papery, electronic,recordy, or kinescope.4.1.2 Information about background of lin-guistic material creatorWe pay some attention on the individual infor-mation of corpus?
creator, because it?s helpfulfor analyzing linguistics characteristic aboutcorpus.
Such information includes native lan-guage, born place, age, sex as well as creator?sname.
For corpus?
creator is not always a singleperson, we define ?Agent Type?
to clarify suchinstance, and introduce other creators in ?Con-tributor?.4.1.3 Information about medium of linguisticmaterialInformation about medium of linguistic materialprovides detailed data of publish region, influ-ence area, circulation extent and so on, whichare all important to evaluate the corpus?
balancegene.
?Medium Type: linguistic material is usuallyselected from different published mediumincluding paper, book, magazine, web orelse.
?Publish Type and Publish Area: respec-tively indicate the geographical area type orsize, such as national or local, and the idio-graphic cantons the area covers.
?Publish Period and Amount: respectivelyshow the publish frequency and copies ofthe publication.4.1.4 Information about the content of lin-guistic materialInformation about the content of linguistic mate-rial describe corpus from the point of view oflinguistics, such as mode and style.
And otherelements in this class focus on two things, that iswhat the material expressed and how it ex-pressed.
For example:?Subject: is used to express the theme of thelinguistic material, while ?Description?gives some further detail of what is talkabout.
?Markup Language: is especially defined toindicate the coding language of electronicresources.4.1.5 Information about collecting linguisticmaterialCorpus is not a simple set of corpus.
When se-lect linguistic material, many factors are consid-ered.
We discuss the information aboutcollecting linguistic material in written corpusand oral corpus respectively.In written corpus, elements mostly describethe information of material sample, such as howto abstract the sample or how long the samplelinguistic material should be.
Oral corpus has itsparticular way to collect materials, so we de-scribe them from the scene character of theinterlocution.4.1.6 Information about management of lin-guistic materialInformation about management of linguistic ma-terial record data for corpus management andfurther-processing.
Most elements are designedfor system administrator and it?s recommendedthat the data is user- sightless.
Such as Tag in-formation of linguistic material:? Identifier: defined for system to identifyeach linguistic material from this uniqueidentifier.
?Sample Name: the material title in the cor-pus .It can either be the original title of thematerial, or new name the corpus?
creatorgives afterward if it has.Log information of linguistic material process-ing are defined for corpus updating and backup,such as input type, annotate type, create date andmodified date.
And system information, such asoperation system (format.os) and CPU (for-mat.cpu) are defined to describe the running en-vironment of the corpus.28in -lecting linguistic materialTable.4.We define 46 elements in all.
They are expectedto describe the resources from six aspects.4.2 SubsectionsTo distinguish one element from another, or ourelements from someone else?s, we provide apotent description method.
Ten subsections aredefined as mutual attribute field.
Each metadataelement can be described with these subsectionsselectively or whole.4.2.1 NameUnique for each element.

It provides a very rich system todefine complex documents and data structures.As long as a programmer has the XML defini-tion for a collection of data (often called a"schema"), they can create a program to processany data format according to those rules.
We?vedefined our metadata format by using XML inseveral schema files.4.4.2 Example of schemaThe following codes define the element ?Style?,which is proposed to describe the style of articlematerial in corpus.
We defined four types ofmode in our standard: narrative writing, exposi-tory writing, argumentative writing and practicalwriting.
In the schema, they are represented as?jixuwen?, ?shuomingwen?, ?lunshuwen?, and?yingyongwen?
respectively.<?xml version="1.0" encoding="GB2312"?><schemaxmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"><annotation><documentation>CMD Schema for Article Style, seiga, 1/7/05</documentation></annotation><simpleType name="CMD-Style-Code"><restriction base="string"><enumeration value="jixuwen"/><enumeration value="shuomingwen"/><enumeration value="lunshuwen"/><enumeration value="yingyongwen"/></restriction></simpleType></schema>Code1.define element ?Mode?
in a schema5 ConclusionMetadata is ?data about data?.
In our norm, a lotwork has been done to describe such data.
Wenormalized data item, naming regulation, datatype and data width.46 metadata elements havebeen defined to register information of resource,within which 15 belong to DC Metadata, 3 be-long to OLAC Metadata, 15 belong to both DCand OLAC Metadata, and 28 are user-defined.According to this, we tag each metadata by its?DefinedIn?
item.
Corpus designers are able tochoose element during the annotation.
They canalso add new elements to satisfy various re-quirements basing on this standard.The standard use English string when de-nominating metadata element, because somesoftware cannot support Chinese variable.
Wedevelop DTD files and an assistant software(FIG.2-FIG.4) for the convenient of corpus an-notation.
By filling blanks with some metadatainformation in this software, users can directlyget the XML code of an annotated corpus.We are to do some further experiment on corpusannotation and corpus management.
With vari-ous information the metadata interpreted, moreworks may lead to resources discovery and con-tent rating.30FIG.2Interface to input the information aboutcopyright, background of linguistic materialcreator and medium of linguistic materialFIG.3Interface to input information aboutthe content of linguistic material and collect-ing linguistic materialFIG.4 Interface to input information aboutmanagement of linguistic materialReferences[1]He tingting.Study on corpus.
