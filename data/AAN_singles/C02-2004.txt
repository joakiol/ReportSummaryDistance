A Linguistic Discovery Program that Verbalizes its DiscoveriesVladimir Pericliev*Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, 04103 Leipzig, Germanypericliev@eva.mpg.de* Currently on leave from the Institute of Mathematics & Informatics, 1113 Sofia, Bulgaria  (peri@math.bas.bg).AbstractWe describe a discovery program, calledUNIVAUTO (UNIVersals AUthoringTOol),whose domain of application is the study oflanguage universals, a classic trend incontemporary linguistics.
Accepting as inputinformation about languages, presented interms of feature-values, the discoveries ofanother human agent arising from the samedata, as well as some additional data, theprogram discovers the universals in the data,compares them with the discoveries of thehuman agent and, if appropriate, generates areport in English on its discoveries.
RunningUNIVAUTO on the data from the seminalpaper of Greenberg (1966) on word orderuniversals, the system has produced severallinguistically valuable texts, two of whichare published in a refereed linguistic journal.1 IntroductionPrevious works in machine scientific discoveryhave mostly focussed on historicalreconstruction (work culminating in the book byLangley et.
al.
1987), but more recent efforts aredirected towards designing programs thatdiscover new scientific knowledge.
Suchsystems operate in disciplines as diverse asmathematics, chemistry, astronomy, medicine orlinguistics.
The field is currently very active (forrecent developments, cf.
e.g.
the special issueson discovery of the journals ArtificialIntelligence, April 1997 or Foundations ofScience 1999; the ECAI-98 Workshop onDiscovery, The International Conferences onDiscovery Science, Japan, 1998 and 1999).In this paper, we present UNIVAUTO(UNIVersals AUthoringTOol), a system whosedomain of application is linguistics, and inparticular, the study of language universals, aclassic trend in contemporary linguistics.
Thistrend was initiated by the pioneering paper ofJoseph Greenberg (1966), investigating wordorder in a database of 30 languages of widegenetic and areal coverage, described in terms of15 ordering features.
Greenberg discovered anumber of universals relating diverse orderingproperties of languages, and his example wasfollowed by attempts at similar generalizationsat other linguistic levels or across levels (for areview of the state-of-the-art, cf.
e.g.
Croft1990).UNIVAUTO was run on various datasets (word order, phonology, morpho-syntax),with very promising linguistic results.
Thepublished outcomes of UNIVAUTO so farinclude : two whole journal articles Pericliev(1999, 2000) based on data from Greenberg(1966) (with no post-editing, the first one withno disclosure of articles?
"machine origin");around 50 statistically significant phonologicaluniversals based on Maddieson?s UPSID-451database, published without post-editing at theUniversals Archive at the University ofKonstanz; the substance discovery (rather thanverbalization) part of Pericliev (2002).
To thebest of our knowledge, this is the first computerprogram to generate a whole scientific article.2 Overview of UNIVAUTOBelow is a brief description of UNIVAUTO(UNIVersals AUthoringTOol), drawing forillustration on data from Greenberg (1966).2.1 The inputUNIVAUTO accepts as input the following,manually prepared, information:(1) A database (=a table), usuallycomprising a sizable number of languages,described in terms of some properties (feature-value pairs), as well as a list of the abbreviationsused in the database.
Below is a (simplified)description of the language Berber in terms ofjust 4 features: v-order (=the position of verb,subject and object), na/an (=the position of nounand adjective), cn/pn (=the position of commonnoun and proper noun), and pref/suf (=thepresence of prefix or suffix):data(berber,[v-order=vso,na/an=na,cnpn/pncn=*,pref/suf=both]).The value "*" is special, and is used to designatethat either the feature cnpn/pncn is inapplicablefor Berber or that the value for that feature isunknown.
(2) a human agent's discoveries(represented as simple logical propositions, iforiginally formulated as complex ones); e.g.
:discovery(agent=greenberg,no=3,nonstatistical,implication(v- order=vso,pr/po=pr)).This record states that a human agent,Greenberg, has found the implicationaluniversal, relating two variables, to the effectthat for all languages, if a language has a Verb-Subject-Object order then this language hasprepositions (rather than postpositions), that thisuniversals is non-statistical (holds withoutexceptions in the studied database), and that it isstated as Universal No.
3 in the originalpublication of the human agent.Aside from these basic sources ofinformation, the input includes information on:the origin of database, if any (the full citation ofwork where the database is given); referencename(s) of database, if any; the kinds of objectsrows and columns represent; etc..2.2 The taskThe task UNIVAUTO addresses can beformulated as follows: Given the inputinformation (as described in 2.1), find thelanguage universals valid in the data, comparethem with those discovered by some humanagent, and write a report, if appropriate.E.g.
a query to the system may look like:?-discover(implication(A,B),non_statistical,positive_examples=4,compare_with=greenberg).It amounts to requesting that non-statisticalimplicational universals holding between twovariables and supported in at least 4 positiveexamples be found, the results be compared withthe findings of Greenberg, and, if judged asinteresting enough, a report of these discoveriesbe written.
Other queries may also be formulated(cf.
3.1), but currently only such involving onetype of universal and one database at a time.2.3 The outputBelow we list some excerpts from Pericliev(1999) as an illustration of the system output.The program was run on the data fromGreenberg (1966), with the query in thepreceding section.
It discovered some problemsin his analyses (which forms the bulk of the textbelow) as well as 59 novel universals of type "IfA then B, non-statistical" (as against 12 foundby Greenberg, one of which further turned out tobe wrong!).
The paragraphs have bold facenumeration to be used for later reference.Figure 1.
Illustrative output of UNIVAUTO_______________________________________[1] Further implicational universals inGreenberg's data[2] The goal of this article is to study theimplicational universals in the 30 languages sampleof Greenberg 1966 and compare the results of thetwo studies.
* <?>[3] We confirmed the validity of universals[12,13,15-a,15-b,21-a,22-a,27-a].
[4] Universal [27-b] is also true, however itviolates our restriction pertaining to the occurrenceof at least 4 positive examples in the dataset.
[27-b]is supported in 1 language (Thai).
[5] Universals [16-a,16-b,16-c] are uncertain,rather than indisputably valid in the databaseinvestigated, since they assume properties inlanguages, which are actually marked in thedatabase as "unknown or inapplicable" (notated with"*" in Table 1).
Universal [16-a] would hold only ifthe feature AuxV/VAux is applicable for Berber,Hebrew, and Maori and in these languages theinflected auxiliary precedes the verb.
Universal [16-b] would hold only if the feature AuxV/VAux isapplicable for Burmese and Japanese and in theselanguages the verb precedes the inflected auxiliary.Universal [16-c] would hold only if the featureAuxV/VAux is applicable for Loritja and in thislanguage the verb precedes the inflected auxiliary.
[6] Universal [23-a] is false.
It is falsified inBasque, Burmese, Burushaski, Finnish, Japanese,Norwegian, Nubian, and Turkish, in which the propernoun precedes the common noun but in which thenoun does not precede the genitive.
[7] We found the following previouslyundiscovered universals in the data.
[8] Universal 1.
If in a language the adjectiveprecedes the adverb then the main verb precedes thesubordinate verb.
[9] Examples of this universal are 8 languages:Fulani, Guarani, Hebrew, Malay, Swahili, Thai,Yoruba, and Zapotec.
<?>[10] Universal 59.
If a language has an initialyes-no question particle then this language has thequestion word or phrase placed first in aninterrogative word question.
** <?>*The generated text continues with description ofwhat an implicational universal is, a table ofGreenberg's 30 language sample, accompanied by theabbreviations used, and a listing of the universals hefound.
His universals, verbalized by our program, arelisted with their numeration in the originalpublication.
An alpha-numeric numeration meansthat an originally complex universal has been splitinto elementary ones of the form "If A then B".
**There follows a conclusion which is a summary ofthe results._______________________________________3 The UNIVAUTO SystemUNIVAUTO comprises two basic modules: onein charge of the discoveries of the program,called UNIV(ersals), and the other in charge ofthe verbalization of these discoveries, calledAU(thoring)TO(ol).3.1 The discovery module UNIVUNIV discovers logical patterns (=universals),including (but not limited to):?
A (absolute, non-implicational universal)?
If A1 and A2 and A3 and...An, then B(implicational universal)UNIV can compute "non-statistical"universals (holding without exceptions) or"statistical" universals (holding with some user-specified percentage of exceptions).Also, UNIV can compute (implicational)universals valid in (at least) a user-specifiednumber of positive examples (=languages), aswell as compute the statistical significance ofuniversals (based on the ?2 statistic).
A minimalset-cover subroutine may guarantee thediscovery of the smallest set(s) of universals,generating a typology (Pericliev 2002).Importantly, given the discoveries ofanother, human agent, UNIV employs adiagnostic program to find (eventual) errors inthe humanly proposed universals.
Currently, weidentify as PROBLEMS the following categories:(1) Restriction Problem: Universalsfound by human analyst that are "under-supported", i.e.
are below a user-selectedthreshold of positive evidence and/or percentageof validity (the latter applying to statisticaluniversals).
(2) Uncertainty Problem: Universalsfound by human analyst that tacitly assume avalue for some linguistic property which isactually unknown or inapplicable (marked by '*'in the database).
(3) Falsity Problem: Universals foundby human analyst that are false or are logicallyimplied by simpler universals.The DISCOVERIES of UNIV are two lists,falling into one of the types: (1) new universals(absolute or implicational, and statistical or non-statistical), and (2) problems (sub-categorized asabove).3.2 The authoring module AUTOAUTO accepts as input the discoveries made byUNIV, but also has access to the input data (cf.2.1) to make further computations, as necessary.AUTO can generally be characterized asa practical text generation system, ofopportunistic type, intended to meet the needs ofour particular task, rather than as a systemintended to handle, in a general and principledway, scientific articles' composition or surfacegeneration of a wide range of linguisticphenomena (reminiscent of earlier work ongeneration from formatted data ofmetereological bulletins (Kittredge et.al.
'sRAREAS) or stock market reports (Kukich'sAna)).
For applied NLG, cf.
e.g.
Reiter et.
al.
(1995); also Computational Linguistics 19984(23), and elsewhere.
Xuang & Fielder (1996)and later work verbalize machine-foundmathematical proofs.First, AUTO needs to know whether thediscoveries of UNIV are interesting enough forgenerating a report, and to this end,  it uses anatural and simple numeric method: UNIV'sdiscoveries (new universals+problems) arejudged worthy of generating a report if they areat least as many in number as the number of thepublished discoveries of the human agentstudying the same database.Having decided upon report generation,AUTO follows a fixed scenario for DISCOURSECOMPOSITION (scientific papers are known tofollow such fixed structure in "genre analysis").The details of this scenario, however, will varyin accordance with a number of parameters,related with the query to the system, thediscoveries made in response to this query, aswell as other considerations.
The basiccomponents of the scenario (alongside withsome minor elaboration) are given below.
Eachcomponent is structured as a separate textparagraph (possibly with sub-(sub)-paragraphs) .1.

References.
Based on data avialable frominput.Below we briefly outline component (5).This paragraph comprises 4 sub-paragraphs, inthis order: one conveying information on theconfirmed humanly found universals (Fig.
1,[3]), and the remaining on problems ofrestrictions (=under-support), uncertainty andfalsity (Fig.
1, [4,5,6]).
Each sub-paragraph startswith an intro_part, making a statement about acollection of discoveries (e.g.
"Universals[1,2,..] are under-supported/uncertain/false..").All but the first sub-paragraph (referring toconfirmed discoveries) also have a body_part,justifying why these predications hold for eachindividual discovery in the collection.The body_parts appeal either solely toexamples (as in Fig.
1, [4], where mentioning anexample of less support, appearing immediatelyafter mentioning of the required one, suffices foran explanation) or to both examples andexplanation of why these are indeed examples.The latter situation is illustrated by (Fig.
1,[5,6]).
Thus, for instance, the examples justifyingthat a universal is false are actually its counter-examples and AUTO will find thesecounterexamples as well as the reason for that(in the case of implication, antecedent true, butconsequent false).AUTO also has a limited SENTENCE-PLANNING FACILITY to decide how to split up aparagraph?s content into sentences and clauses.Assume, for the sake of illustration, that we needto verbalize an under-support body_part, likethat on (Fig.
1, par.
[4]), but, say, requiring atleast 8 supporting languages.
The input to thesentence planning facility of AUTO would looklike this (the last constituents indicating thenumber of supporting languages):[3]--is_supported--Berber,Hebrew,Maori,Masai,Welsh,Zapotec--6[12]--is_supported--Berber,Hebrew,Maori,Masai,Welsh,Zapotec--6[15-a]--is_supported--Berber,Hebrew,Maori,Masai,Welsh,Zapotec--6[27-b]--is_supported--Thai--1[13]--is_supported--Burmese,Burushaski,Hindi,Japanese,Kannada,Turkish?6AUTO will form separate sentences from thepropositions having an equal number ofsupporting evidence.
Within the framework ofeach such sentence, the system will grouptogether the propositions supported by the samelanguages, taking care that the universals withsmaller numeration appear first.
After somefurther transformations, the system outputs this:[27-b] is supported in 1 language (Thai).
[13] issupported in 6 languages (Burmese, Burushaski,Hindi, Japanese, Kannada, and Turkish), and so are[3,12,15-a] (Berber, Hebrew, Maori, Masai, Welsh,and Zapotec).For SURFACE GENERATION we use ahybrid approach, employing both templates andgrammar rules, as required by the needs at thespecific portions of text we are producing.The templates consist of canned text,interspersed with variables whose values are tobe computed.
The variables may stand either forindividual words or for more abstract entitiesthan words whose values are computed bygrammar rules.
To ensure agreement e.g.
AUTOemploys rules for agreement between subjectand predicate, noun and determiner,demonstrative, relative-marker, apposition;between noun and pronoun (for pronominalreference); external sandhi, etc.
If e.g.
a variablestands for a list of languages, it will be handledby a grammar rule for and-coordinated NP to gete.g.
"Masai, Welsh, and Zapotec".
Also, thetemplates are often  randomly chosen among aset of "synonymous" alternatives in order toincrease the variability of the produced texts.We have grammar rules to handle avariety of syntactic constructions, but the mostimportant of them are those responsible for theverbalization of universals (forming by far thelargest bulk of the produced texts).
Thedictionary part of that grammar is supplied frominput (cf.
2.1).
There are diverse ways ofexpressing implications in English (and we donot confine only to implications), and thegrammar tries to attend to this fact.
Thegrammar is a random generator, ensuring theavoidance of intra-textual repetitions in thestatement of the many universals UNIV usuallyfinds.Finally, AUTO also supports formattingfacilities, e.g.
for capitalization, correct spacingaround punctuation marks, etc.4 ConclusionWe have shown how a simple text generator canbe linked to a linguistic discovery program inorder to verbalize its discoveries.
Despite theseemingly bizarre nature of the task of articlegeneration, this work was actually inspired bythe practical need to verbalize the great numberof universals UNIV has systematically found inthe various databases we have explored, as wellas by the need to compare these with thefindings of previous researchers.
Presumably,such problems have not confronted previousdiscovery programs because they searched non-conventional spaces (necessitating additionalhuman interpretation of results), because theirsolution objects (e.g.
numerical laws inphysics/mathematics, reaction path-ways inchemistry, etc.)
are not amenable to verbalexpression or simply because the set of solutionobjects has been too small to require automatedverbalization.In sum: UNIVAUTO models scientificdomains in which a machine is likely to findnumerous and verbalizable solution objects(conceivably, low-level generalisations), and thescientific discourses in these domains arebasically limited to description of these findings.We believe that such domains are notexceptional in empirical sciences generally, andhence systems like ours are not unlikely toemerge to aid scientists in these domains.Acknowledgment.
