IntroductionThis article describes an experiment approaching syntactical analysis of l'ortuguese based onTree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) \[JOSltl 75\].
It briefly presents the TAG formalism, placingit among other description tbrmalisms used for natural language processing, and introduces aprototype which is being developed in order to validate application of this formalism toPortuguese language.The present work concerns entence analysis at syntaclical evel, which can be viewed as aprocess with two main ftmctions for natural language processing : the identification of theinput components hrough association of tree structures to sentences, and regularization of theidentified structure in order to minimize the number of trees for each sentence \[GR1StlMAN86\].Although Context-Free Grammars (CFG) have been the most studied ones in order to describenatural language, purely context-fiee granlmars are not adequate for this description \[R/Ctt91\].Context-Sensitive Grammars (CSG) are also used for description of natural languages,however they have not been proven to be a suitable tbmmlism ~br stating most grammaticalconstraints \[GRISHMAN 86\]./Z.~Categorial Grammars (CG) seem to be a tendency for natural language description, includingseveral related formalisms, all involved with the foundations of modern syntactic and semanticstheories \[STEEDMAN 93\].Among the formalisms related to Categorial Grammars we can mention Tree AdjoiningGrammars (TAGs) \[JOSHI 75\] \[JOSHI 85\], Lexical Functional Grammar \[BRESNAN 82\],Dependency Grammar \[HUDSON 82\] and Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar \[GAZDAR85\].
These grammatical formalisms and linguistic theories are based on unification andspecification of constraints for definition of the possible structures to be unified.This article is organized in four items.
After a brief introduction, we present the TreeAdjoining Grammars formalism, describing its main components and operations, We commentour steps toward construction of a syntactical analyzer for Portuguese language and makesome consideration about the prototype described.2.
Tree Adjoining GrammarsTree Adjoining Grammars were first described by \[JOSHI 75\], as a tree based system, wherethe basic component is a set of elementa,3, trees.
Each tree represents a minimal linguisticstructure and is a domain of locality.
A TAG comprises two kinds of elemental 3,trees:initial trees, which are complete structures, with pre-terminals on the leaves;auxiliary trees, which must have exactly one leaf node with the same syntactic ategoryof the root node.The elementary trees localize dependencies, like agreement, sub categorization, etc.
and musthave at least one terminal node.Sentences generated from a language defined by a TAG can be derived by the composition ofan initial tree and elementary trees, through two operations: substitution and adjunction.Substitution, as showed in Fig 1, inserts an initial tree (oi- a tree derived fiom an initial tree) ontile correspondent leaf node in the elementary tree.Adjunction, as showed in Fig 2, inserts an auxiliary tree on the correspondent node in anelementary or derived tree.
"1256SFig 1 - Substitution / \ Fig 2 - Adjunction Z~The adjunction operation can be recursive, then an auxiliary tree can receive adjunction initself.
Adjunction allows an insertion of a complete structure on a node of another completestructure.Adjunction makes TAGs a little more powerful then Context-Free Grammars (CFG), placing itin a class of grammars called Midly Context-Sensitive Grammars \[JOSHI 85\].
This operationpreserves the dependencies among unbounded structures of the sentence.3.
Portuguese analysis with TAGsSeveral research groups are working with Tree Adjoining Grammars.
There are descriptions ofgrammars for French \[ABEILLE 91\], English \[SCHABES 88\], a study for German\[RAMBOW 92\], among other languages.In order to analyze Portuguese language, there are many studies being developed, in Brazil andPortugal, which approach different formalisms.
These researches focus punctual areas aslexical analysis \[COURTIN 89\], data-base queries using natural anguage \[BIGOLIN 93\],semantic analysis \[FREITAS 93\] \[LUZ 93\], etc.In TAG tbrlnalism we can find aspects that help syntactic analysis of Portuguese, tbr example,the possibility to have unboundness dependencies, such as agreement, among nodes.Jog\[o, quc fala porhlgu~s, csluda informfitica.
lWe are working on a grammar to describe Portuguese, and we are developing a syntacticalanalyzer for this grammar.
One of the problems we t~aced was the absence of a description of7257the most common structures used for our language, something as "fimdamental Portuguese",so we selected the subset o work with.We decided by a large subset, which includes active and passive voice, relative andinterrogative clauses, auxiliary and support verbs, and clitic pronouns.The syntactical categories included are verbs, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, articlesand prepositions.
For each one of the categories there are syntactical traits associated like:concrete, abstract, number, gender, person, mode, voice, ...The grammar is organized according to the formalism, using initial trees and auxiliary trees todescribe surface structures of Portuguese language.
These study was based on Portuguesenormative grammars \[ROCHA LIMA 92\], and generative grammars \[LOBATO 86\].Example of initial trees :S / \N Vi IJo~o correSW N V NPorque Jogo estuda Intbrmfitica?Example of auxiliary trees :AdjAdj N Art NI I Lbelo gato o gato beloadj \A~UpequenoIts important to observe that each one of the nodes associated to a tree has traits used t'orunification, and can have dependency traits between unbounded nodes.
These dependencytraits are kept under an adjunction operation.The first version of the syntactical analyzer, based upon TAGs, includes the acquisition of1258elementary trees, input of the sentence to be analyzed, construction era solution tree (made byadjunctkm and substitution), and unification of the input sentence with the solution tree.
Notethat the analyzer must return all the derived trees tbr the given input sentence.The elementary trees are supposed to contain intbrmation about the hierarchy of the nodes,type of that tree (relative, interrogative,...), operations that can be made on each node, andtraits to be unifiedSyntactical analyzer input sentence comes fl'om a morphological analyzer that splits thissentence in components such as words or expressions, associating them a set of traits.Construction of the deriw,'d tree is made by adjunction and substitution operations overelementary trees.
Unification compares traits of the input sentence with the traits described onTAG trees, producing the resulting trees.Inclusion of semantic traits will allow us to upgrade this analyzer in a semantic-syntacticanalyzer, anticipating evahmtion of semantic traits to syntactical nalysis, reducing the numberof resulting trees.4.
Final remarksIn the scope of a project aiming to develop tools to treat Portuguese at morphological,syntactic and semantic levels, we started with lnorphological level, and we calne to animplementation f a robust lexical-morphological analyzer through trie trees \[STRUBE DELIMA 93\].
As a next step, we approached syntactical level looking for a tbrmalism adequate tosupport Portuguese language.
A large subset ot' this language was outlined, which should giverise to an experiment of implementation of algorithms and data structures for parsingPortuguese.This seems to be the fhst study using Tree Adjoining Granunars for Portuguese language.
Ourcontribution would state on description ol'a large subset of the language, construction of" treesthat represent syntactic structures for Pomtgucse, and development of a parser, according tothe formalism.We described around 300 inicial trees in order to cover the subset outlined, and developed abottom-up LR parser working efficiently.
We are now studying complementary data structuresas a syntactical dictionary in order to improve the parser.
This dictionary would be hcll)ful toconstruct the solution tree, searching \['astly the trees that can be used tbr a word.
We are also1259adapting the output of  the morphological analyzer in a model that fits the input o f  thesyntactical analyzer developed.Tree Adjoining Grammars formalism, to this moment, seems to present aspects that benefittreatment o f  Portuguese language in a robust way.
Acquisition of  new trees can be madeeasily, as well as describing semantic traits together with the syntactical ones.5.
