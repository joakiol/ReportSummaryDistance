LEVELS OF REPRESENTATION IN NATURAI, LANGUAGE BASED INFORMATIONSYSTEMS AND THEIR RELATION TO THE METHODOI,OGY OF COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICSG.
ZIFONUN, INSTITUT FUER DEUTSCHE SPRACHE,D-6800 MANNHEIM, FEDERAL REPUBI.IC GERMANYSummar LIn this paper the methodological ba-sis of the 'computational linguistics ap-proach' for representing the meaning ofnatural language sentences is investiga-ted.
Its adherance to principles of for-mal linguistics and formal philosophy oflanguage like the 'separation of levelsof syntactic and semantic analysis', andthe "Fregean" principle may be contrast-ed with the 'artificial intell igence ap-proach'.
A "Montague" style method ofmapping the syntax of natural languageonto the syntax of the 'semantic lan-guage' used as the means of internal re-presentation in the information systemPLIDIS is presented.
Rules for definingsubsequent levels of representation like'syntax-interpretative level', 'redundancy'free level' are given.IntroductionThe present paper presents ideasconcerning a methodology of the 'seman-tics in computational linguistics' (COL-semantics).There is the following hypothesisunderlying:In the field of COL-semantics algo-rithms and computer programs are devel-oped which deliver structures of lingui-stic analysis and representation thatcan be compared with those of formal lin-guistic semantics and satisfy the ade-quacy criteria of certain linguistic the-ories.
They therefore are suitable in-struments for developing and testing suchtheories.COL-semantics hence proceeds in away different from the semantic process-ing as it is found in the framework ofartificial intell igence (AI-semantics).AI-semantics is not so much linked tothe semantics of formal linguistics orlogic but rather to cognitive psycholo-gy, problem solving theory and the the-ory of knowledge representation which hasbeen recently put forward within AI it-self.
1 Between both branches of semanticprocessing of natural language that arerealized in computer systems there there-fore exists a difference in aims, the-ories and methods.Starting from a brief sketch ot theaims and theories of both approaches oneessential methodological principle ofCOL-semantics will be elaborated in thesecond chapter of the paper.
In the thirdchapter COL-semantic methods will be ex-emplif ied by a concrete application, theproduction of semantic representations inan information system.

In lingui-stic semantics and also in COL-semanticsmeta-l inguistic notions which refer tolanguage as a system like 'synonymy','equivalence' and (particularly in theformal linguistics based on logic)'truth'and 'entailment' are crucial; in AI-se-mantics however we have the 'behaviour'oriented conce~ts of ' inferencing','dis-ambiguating', "reasoning', 'planning'etc oA methodological principle ofCOL-semanticsA distinctive feature of lingui-stics, especially logico-l inguistic the-ories, is the separation of different"expression" and "content" levels of ana-lysis and representation and the speci--202fication of mapping rules between them(surface structure versus deep structure,syntactic structure versus semantic struc-ture).
In Montague grammar this differen-tiation between a well defined syntacticlevel and an also well defined semanticlevel of description is a methodological-ly necessary consequence of the "Fregean"principle.
The Fregean principle statesthat the meaning of an expression can bedetermined on the basis of the meaningsof its logically simple constituent ex-pressions and the syntactic structure ofthe whole expression.
This principle hasbeen revived by Montague and has ~eenre-alized in his theory of language in sucha way that the syntactic and the seman-tic structure of a natural language ex-pression are respectively represented asexpressions of formal systems (syntax andmeaning algebras) between which systemsthere exist well defined formal relation-ships (homomorphisms).When this concept is transferred tothe operationalizing of l inguistic analy-sis in a computer system it will be ex-cluded to conceive the mapping from nat-ural language into semantic representa-tion as a simple integrated pass, wherein the course of parsing a sentence thevalid semantic interpretation is assignedto each occurring item or group of itemsand where the possibil it ies of inferenceand association with stored backgroundknowledge are flocally f realized withoutever generating a full syntactic analysis.Saving an explicit level of syntactic re-presentation seems to be compatible withthe Fregean principle only under the con-dition that the algorithm incorporates agrammar (in the technical sense of a con-sistent set of generating or acceptingsyntactic rules), but for reasons of op-timization directly associates or appliessemantic 'values' or 'rules' in process-ing the corresponding syntactic 'nodes'or 'rules '4, or even allows a semanticcontrol of rule selection without leavingthe parsing mode.
This condition howeveris mostly not maintained in AI parsing ap-proaches where the one step processing isunderstood as a cognitively adequate ana-logue of human linguistic information pro-cessing and where even the terminal andnon terminal symbols of the "grammar" areinterpreted as semantic categories.5Syntactic and semantic represen-tation in an information systemThe way of processing natural lan-guage according to the principles of COL-semantics shall be demonstrated by thelinguistic component of a natural languageinformation system.
The description is o-riented at the application area and thestructure of the system PLIDIS (informa-tion system for controll ing industrialwater pollution, developed at the Insti-tut fuer deutsche Sprache, Mannheim).
6Giving only the over all structure of thesystem we have the following processingsand levels:morphological analysis of naturallanguage input ~ syntactic analysis (le-vel of syntactic representation) ~ trans-duction into formal representation lan-guage (level of semantic representation)interpretation (evaluation) against thedatabase ~ answer generationThe formal representation languageis the language KS an extended first or-der predicate calculus, where the fea-tures going beyond predicate calculus aremany sorted domain of individuals, lambda-abstraction and extended term building.
7In the following two aspects of the se-mantic representation will be treated:- the mapping between syntactical-ly analyzed natural language expressionsand their KS counterparts will be inves-tigated- a differentiation between threelevels of semantic representation will beaccounted for: (level l) syntax-interpre-tative level, (level 2) canonical level,(level 3) database-related level,All three levels follow the samesyntax, i.e.
the syntax of KS and havethe same compositional model theoretic se-mantics; they differ in their non logicalconstant symbols._Mapping_natural language into thekemantic representation l~i!g~age KSIn analogy with Montague's "theoryof translation" in "Universal Grammar"weassume that the syntactic structures ofnatural language (NL, here German) and thesemantic language (here KS) are similar,i.e.
there exists a translation functionf, such that the following holds:(l.l.)
Given the categories of acategorial grammar of NL, f is mappingfrom these categories on the syntactic ca-tegories of KS.
I.e.
If m, ~I, ..., ~n arebasic categories of German, then f(~), f(~I),..., f(#n) are syntactic categories of K$.If ~/~I/.../~n is a derived category (func-tor category) of NL, then f(~)/f(~1)/.../f(~n) is a derived category of KS.(1.2.)
If a is-an expression of ca-tegory 6 in NL (a6), then f(a) is an expres-sion of category f(6) in KS (f(a)f(6)).(1.3.)

The fol lowing intui-t ively val id synonymy postulates (meaningpostulates) can be formulated.- -205- -(1) A NL noun phrase containing n (n _> o)attributes (category O-N/NP/.../NP)I I-EYiih-gsi s  synonymous  w i th  an NP conta in ingn+\] a t t r ibutes ,  where  the  n+\ ]s t  a t -t r ibute  i s  an unspec i f ied  "p laceho lder"  a t t r ibute ,  under  the  precon-d i t ion  that  the  cent ra l  noun o f  theNP systematically admitslOn+\] attri-butes :eine Probe is synonymous eine Probe beiwith einem Betrieb('a sample ('a sample of anof sewage industr ia l  plant' )water ' )The application of this principlemay be iterated.
(2 There are verb classes the elementsof which have no descriptive meaning("non-content verbs"), in German theso called "Funktionsverben", thecopula segn and others).
In such ca-ses the NP as object or subject ofthe verb is the content bearer or'principal' NP, e.e.
it becomes thepredicate of the proposition.
Such asentence is synonymous with a cor-responding sentence containing a con-tent verb equivalent in meaning tothe content bearing NP.
For example:Arsengehalt l iegt inder Probe vor.
('There exists anarsenic content  inthe sample.
')is  synonymousw i thDie Probe enth~it Arsen.
('The sample containsarsenic.
')In such a non-content verb proposi-tion a noun phrase with a place hol-der attribute can also function as a"second order" principal NP, i.e.
itsunspecif ied attribute can be replacedby a "filler" NP, occurring as argu-ment of the non-content verb:Arsengehalt liegt bei Lauxmann in der Probevor.
is  synonymous  w i thDie Probe bei Lauxmann enthZlt Arsen.Both postulates shall be applied fortransducing the level \] representationsof NL sentences into level 2 representa-tions.
We first give a definition of'principal term', i.e.
the KS construc-tion corresponding to a 'principal NP'.(Def.)
A principal term in a formula con-taining as PRAED the translation of anoncontent verb is a term that is capable,according to its semantic and syntacticstructure, to embed other argument termso~ the translation of the non contentverb as its arguments.The operationalized version of thetwo principles is now after having shift-ed them onto the KS level:(1: maximality principle)When a NL-expres-sion has n analysis (n ~ 2J in level \]which only differ in the number of argu-ments, then the level 2 representationconsists of the 'maximal' level I expres-sion, i.e.
the expression containing thelargest number of arguments.
Any failingarguments are to be substituted by (ex-istentially bound~ variables.
(2: transformation principle)(2.1.)
When the PRAED of a formula is thetranslation of a non-content verb, atleast one of its arguments must be a prin-cipal term.(2.2.)
A formula containing the transla-tion of a non content verb must be trans-formed into an expression which containsthe PRAED of a principal term as predi-cate iff there is an unambiguous mappingof the arguments of the translation ofthe non-content verba) into arguments of aprincipal termorb) into a princapal termsuch that a wel l - formed formula of leve\]2 is obtained.We now state that PROBE and ENTHALTare 'maximal' expressions and PROBEI andENTHALTI must be mapped into them re-spectively and that further holds:VORLIEG is the translation of the non-content verb vorliegenPROBE is the PRAED of a second orderprincipal term with respect toa 'plant' argumentENTHALT is the PRAED of a principal termwith respect to a 'sample' ar-gumentThen the two examples of level I aremapped into a single representation onlevel 2:\[ENTHALT\[JOTA\[LAMBDA x\[PROBE G-L XJ\]\]AS1\]The reduction of synonymous structures inthe canonical level of representationmeets the criteria of economy as they arenecessary in a computer system.
II As wehave tried to show, however,it can bebased upon general l inguistic principlesand need not be imputed to the field of"world semantics".
On the other side ad-mitting paraphrases as natural languageinput (as our examples are) improves thesystems "cooperativeness" towards theuser.
In PLIDIS special aspects of theworld model are accounted for in the le-vel 3 representations which mirror therelational structure of the data modelto some extent.
We can not go into thedetails of the relationship between level2 and level 3 ~or reasons of space.-206Comparisonwith other approachesLanguage processing systems thatare oriented at Montague grammar or mo-del theoretic semantics are being devel-oped among others by Friedman et al,Sondheimer and the PHLIQAI group.
A the-oretical discussion of the relationshipbetween model theoretic semantics and AI-semantics can be found in Gunji and Sond-heimer cf.
also Hobbs and RosenscheinSt.
Bien and Wilks (witha contrary vlew).The methodological ideas presented hereare most closely related with the ap-proach of multi-level semantics pursuedin PHLIQAi.
But unlike the PHLIQAi ap-proach we regard the level(sJ of lingui-stic representation not only under themore formal aspect of syntax interpreta-tion but, as the last chapters show, wealso take into account aspects of seman-tics of natural language word classes andstructural synonymy.Notes1 There are certainly important inter-actions with empirial semantic workdone in the last 10 years, soOrtonyand Wilks stress the pervasive in-fluence of Fillmore.
Like any othersystematic distinction the one bet-ween formal llnguistic semantics andAI-semantics is somewhat simplifying:Within AI there are semantic approa-ches which are more or less orientedat formal logic, so the one of McCar-thy, Creary or Nash-Webber and Reiterand others.
As typical AI-semantic ap-proaches we regard the ones of Schankand his colleagues, Wi?ks or Charniak(cf.
for instance the articles inCharniak and Wilks).2 Hayes, 93 Slightly exaggerating this tendencyis formulated by Schank in Schank etal.
):"Researchers in NPL (natural lan-guage processing in AI) have becomeless and less concerned with languageissues per se.
We are more interestedin inferencing and memory models forexample."
(p. 1OO8)4 Such systems are presented for in-stance in Riesbeck, Norman and Rumel-hart, and even more programmaticallyin Schank et al, DeJong.
Also in sys-tems conceived as data base interfaceslike LIFER (Hendrix) and PLANES ~altz)"semantic"grammars are used.
A theore-tical discussion on the role of syn-tax can be found in Schank et al5 I.e.
one has to check, whether in sys-tems containlng only "part grammars"or working with a syntactic "pre-pro-cessing" the syntactic rules whichwere effectively used, can be com-bined resulting in a coherent and con-sistent grammar.
Questions of syntac-tic-semantic and purely semantic gram-mars underlying parsers are also dis-cussed from a theoretical point ofview in Wahlster.The system PLIDIS is described inKolvenbach, L6tscher and Lutz.The language KS ("Konstruktsprache")is described in Zifonun.Cresswell gives an analogous categorialdescription for verbs.
Like in thisminimal grammar in applying the ruleof concatenation phenomena of word or-der are neglected.Keenan and Faltz introduce the cate-gory of "function noun" (in our frame-work O-N/NP)10 The vague condition of "systematical-ly admitting" is made concrete inPLIDIS by prescribing a semantic"sort"for each argument of a predicate.ii This reduction is done in PLIDIS withthe help of meaning postulates whichare interpreted by a theorem prover.ReferencesBronnenberg, W.J.H.J./Bunt, H.C./Lands-bergen, S.P.J./Scha, R.J.H./Schoen-makers, W.J./van Utteren, E.P.C.
