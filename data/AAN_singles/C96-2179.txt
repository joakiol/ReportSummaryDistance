This grammaris compared to a comprehensive compu-tational grammar of English which wasimplemented using the same computerworkbench.
Although many similari-ties may be observed in the two gram-mars, there are important structural d i fferences which can be traced back to fea-tures specific to the F~'ench language, no-tably agreement and cliticization.1 In t roduct ionWe present a large-coverage computational gram-mar of French (CGF) 1 and discuss some imple-mentation aspects of' this grammar by comparingit to the Alvey Natural Language Tools Grmmmar (ANLT Grammar) (Grover et al, 1.993) whichwins also implemented using the Grammar De-velopment Environment (GDE) (Bogm'aev et al,1988).
The grammar of French was implementedas part of a larger project, the goals of which arethe development and application of GeneralizedPhrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar etal., 1985) in general and the design and implemen-tation of a comprehensive computational gram-mar for French in particular.In this paper, we highlight the many similari-ties between the two grammars but especially dif-ferences due to phenomena particular to French.This leads to a description of the major structuraldifferences between tile two grammars.We shall not justify the reasons for our choiceof GPSG but will simply point out that GPSGis a formal theory which is unification-based andhence well-suited for computational linguistics.The Grammar Development Environment is acomputer workbench for the development andevaluation of computational grammars of natural1This resem'ch is flmded by SSHRCC (40-93-0607)and by FCAR (95ERl198)language which are described in a style close tothat of GPSG.
It embodies a modified version ofGPSC which is easier to implement than its the-oretical counterpart.
The GDE was developed aspart of the Alvey Natural Language Tools projectin the UK.2 Compar i son  o f  the  twogrammarsThe ANLT grammar was used as a model and ini-tial source of inspiration for the design and imple-mentation of the grammar of l~'ench, despite obvi-ous differences between tile two languages.
Bothgrammm-s trive to account for the same t)roper-ties of natural language although they differ onpoints of detail, the differences being essentiallystructural.2.1 Similar it iesX-bar theory is used in (Gazdar et al, 1985) tocharacterize constituent structm'e.
In our gram-mar, as in the ANLT grammar, X-bar schemataare respected in general, although there are differ-ences of detail.
There is no specifier in the verbphrase (VP), thus the V2 immediately dominatesthe V; complex specifiers in noun phrases (NP)and adjectival and adverbial phrases (AdjP andAdvP) are given special treatment: there are X2level specifiers of X2 constituents, as tbr examplein:(I) N2 -4 R2\[POSS +\],  H2the man 's  black hatN2 --+ N2\ [TYPR co l l \ ] ,  H2une foule de ces 6tudiants (a c rowd of thosestudents)Fur thermore ,  some constituents have a specifierat level X1  even if there is a specifier at level X2  :(2) N2 -4 Spec, H2tous les enfants, all the childrenN2 -4 Det ,  H Iles enfants, the childrenAdjectival, adverbial and  prepositional phrasesare treated in a similar fashion in both  grammars .1024Thus in ninny respects our grammar followsclosely the ANLT grammar.2.2 Dif ferencesThe structure of tile NP and that of the VP inthe CGF differ from those in the ANLT gram-mar.
This is a reflection of phenomena which arecharacteristic of French: cliticization, present inIS"ench but not in English, and agreement, whichis more limited in English titan in l~?eneh.
Weoverview these phenomena and then examine thestructures.2.2.1 AgreementThere are nnmy more cases of agreement inFrench than in English and mmw more lexicalitems exhibit agreement fi~,atures (determiners,adjectives, past participles and conjugated verbs).In particular, two sets of rules are required to ac-count for AdvP and AdjP constituents in CGF,since only the latter is subject o agreement.
TheagreeInent patterns are more complex as well.
Inthe VP for example the past participle ('.an agreewith a direct object when it is anteposed (3), orwith its subject when it is conjugated with ~.trc(for a non-pronominal verb); otherwise it remainsinvariant.
(3) la table que Paul a faite (the table that Paulmade)il les a vus (he saw them)In quantified NPs, we examine two cases:1.
When the subject of a w:rb is an NP quanti-fied by an adverb or an adjective, the comple-ment of tile quantifier determines agreement:(4) beaucoup de garcons ont arrivds (ninnyboys have arrived(masc, pl.
))bcaucoup de filles sont m'rivdes (manygirls have arrived(ti-~m, pl.))2.
When tile subject of a verb is a collectivenoun, the verb <:an agree either with the col-lective or with the element it quantifies:(5) une foule de garcons est arrivdc (a crowdof boys has arrived(fern, sg.
))une tbule de garcons sont arrivds (acrowd of boys have arrived(masc, pl.
))2.2.2 Clit icsCliticization refers to the phenomenon where aw~rbal complement can be pronominalized and ad-joined to the verb:(6) Pierre volt le garqon (Peter sees the boy)Pierre le volt ("Peter him sees")This phenomenon is interesting because it bearsa superficial resemblance to long distance depen-dencies, which are dealt with by SLASH in GPSG.3 St ructura l  d i f fe rencesThe data relative to cliticization and agreementhave dictated the structure of the French VP andNP.3.1 The  s t ructure  of  the  F rench  VPThe structure for the VP in English developed inthe ANLT grammar corresponds to that in (Gaz-dar et al, 1982): a binary branching structurewhere each verbal element takes a VP complementof a specifc type (the "cascading structure").The same type of structure for the French VP isgenerally assumed in transformational or genera-tive grammar and also in GPSG analyses (Miller,1991).
We haw', departed from these traditionalanalyses and have implelnented a fiat structure forthe compomld tenses, while retaining the cascad-ing one for the passive.
For example, the structurefor a direct transitive verb is expressed by the rulein (7) and the passive by the rnle in (8):(7) SV --~ H\[AUX +\], V\[AUX -\], N2(8) SV -+ H\[SUBCAT ~tre \ ] ,  X2\[PRD\]In rule (8), the X2 can be realized as a p~ssiveparticiple or any predicative complement, as inthe GPSG analysis of passives.3.1.1 Arguments  for a f lat s t ruc tureThe arguments in favour of distinguishing thetwo structures are numerous.
Many have beendiscussed in (Abeill6 A Godard, 1994) and alsoin (Emirkanian A Da Sylva, 1995).
Directly rel-evant: to our discussion is the fact that only thepassive participle may be cliticized (9a)2 not theparticiple involved in compound tenses (gb):(9) a. il est aired par Marie (he is loved by Mary)il l'est ("he it is")b. il a mang~5 une poinme (he ate an apple)* il l'a ("he it has")Thus in the passive structure, the copula be-haves like control verbs such as the modal vouloir(to want) which take a V2 complement: il veutpartir (he wants to leave) yields il le veut ("he itwants" ).Our analysis of the French VP also provides anaccount of past partieilfle agreeinent.
In GPSG,agreement is handled by the Control-AgreementPrinciple (CAP).
a However, we have been unableto account for past participle agreement in Frenchusing the CAP (see (Emirkanian et al, in press)); 42With or without its eolnplements.
See (Abeill5 AGodard, 1994) for more details.aln the GDE implementation f the grammar ofEnglish (Grover et al, 1993), the CAP seems satis-factorily transposed: it is implemented by a relativelysnmll set of propagation rules, which respect he gen-erality of the CAP.aThis article shows on the other hand how, tbr thepast participle, the CAP can account for agreement inpredicative structures, for example the passive.1025the latter account makes use of other devices, suchas the Feature Cooccurrence Restrictions and theFeature Specification Defaults.3.1.2 GDE Implementat ion  of  a flat VPThe insertion of the auxiliary into the VP struc-ture to produce a flat VP is done by a metarule.However, implementing this flat structure in theGDE was found to be highly problematic.
In theGDE, grammars are pre-compiled into orderedphrase structure rules, and the number of theserules necessary to account for the VP turned outto be extremely large.
To give an idea of the sizeof the resulting grammar, consider the lexical IDrule for a verb requiring an NP and a PP comple-ments:(I0) V2 --~ H\[3\], N2, P2\[~\]Paul donne un livre ~ Marie (Paul gives abook to Mary)The following metarules operate on this ID rule:passiveS; direct object extraction (SLASH N2); di-rect object cliticization (accusative); direct objectcliticization (oblique); indirect object extraction(SLASH P2\[h\]); indirect object cliticization (da-tive); indirect object cliticization (locative); directobject extraction (SLASH N2\[de\]); adverb inser-tion; auxiliary insertion; supercompound aux in-sertion; negative adverb (pas) insertion; subjectclitic insertion.Although not all rules are compatible with eachother (in particular, no direct object extractionrule can apply to the result of the passive rule), thecombinatorics are complex: in a test grammar, wefound that the number of phrase structure rulescorresponding to this ID rule was of the order of2 la, or over 8000.
This is of course unacceptable,as the CGF comprises 45 different lexical ID rules.Not all of them give rise to so many rules, but thecompilation time and size of the output grammarmade this solution impractical.Instead, we implemented the structure of theVP as a verbal complex of the auxiliary and thepast participle which is sister to the complements.The above metarules apply either to the verbalcomplex or to the complements, thus reducingconsiderably the combinatorics.
The resultingstructure is sufficiently equivalent from a theoret-ical perspective (i.e., the past participle and itscomplements do not form a constituent) and it al-lowed us to implement the bulk of our grammar.The size of our grammar is now as follows: 185 IDrules and 81 metarules.
After compilation, these185 ID rules expand to 2630 expanded ID rulesand 3053 phrase structure rules.Let us now turn to our account of the structureof the NP.5The optionality of the agent gives rise to two IDrules from the output of this metarule.3.2 The  s t ructure  of  the  F rench  NPThe data relative to cliticization and agreementhave shaped the structure of the NP in variousways.
Our study of the French NP has been influ-enced mainly by the work of (Milner, 1978).
Wewill concentrate here oil quantitative structures(such as beaueoup d'enfants, many children) andpartitive structures (such as beaucoup de ces en-rants, many of these children).
These involve aquantifier (adverb, pronoun, collective or adjec-tive) whose "complement" contains respectively adeterminer-less NP with de (de filles) or an NPwith a definite determiner (de ces filles).The ANLT grammar's treatment of partitiveNPs such as "all of the children", akin to trois decos filles and also to beaueoup de filles, assumesa three-way branching structure, given by the fbl-lowing rule:(11) N2\[+SPEC\] --~ A2, P\ [of j ,  N2\[+SPEC\]This structure must be rejected for Frenchbased on data from cliticization: the de and whatfollows must form a constituent, which may becliticized as en like a P2 \[PFORM de\] can be(12) je parle de Marie (I speak of Mary)j'en parle ("I of-her speak")je vois beaucoup de filles (I see many girls)j'en vois beaucoup ("I of-them see many")But rather than treat this constituent as a P2,we treat it as an N2 with \[PFORM de\], becauseof agreement data: agreement features from thecomplement must be allowed to percolate upwardsto explain possible agreement patterns with it, asin une foule d'hommes ont venus (a crowd of menhave come).
This can be achieved only if the com-plement is allowed to be an N2 head of the higherNP, and not a P2 (there is no justification foragreement features on a PP in French).
(Miller ~,1991) also argues in favour of treating de and d inFrench as markers on N2, rather than as prepo-sitions, yielding N2 \[PFORM de\] and N2 \[PFORM 5\].The following rules for a subset of French quan-titative constructions highlight the prevalence ofthis N2:6(13) a. N2 \[PFORM nil\] -+ Adv2 \[+QTE\], H2 \[de\]beaucoup de filles (many girls)b. N2\[PFORM nil\] --* N2\[Coll\], H2\[de\]une foule de filles (a crowd of girls )c. N2\[PFORM nil\] -+ A2\[+QTE\] , H2\[de\]trois filles (three girls)d. N2\[PFORM nil\] -~ H2\[de\]des filles (girls)6We have omitted the description of the inter-nal structure of this g2 \[de\].
Our grammar accountsfor the absence of an explicit de in certain contexts(i.e.,trois filles) as well as its presence in extraposedcontexts ( fen ai trois, de fllles) and its contractionwith the determiner des to produce simply de (de filles- r~gle de caeophonie).1026The following examples featuring cliticizationand dislocated structures, where tim de reappears,also argue for the N2\[de\]:(14) a. il voit be.aucoup d(; filles("he sees many of gMs")il en voit l)eaucoul) ("he o f  them sees lnany")il en voit 1)eaucoul), (le filles("he o f  them sees many, of girls")(14) b. il volt une foule de lilles (he sees a crowdof girls)il en volt une fbulc, de tilles ("he of-them seesa crowd, of girls")(14) c. il volt trois filles(he sees three girls)il en voit trois ("he o f  them sees three")il en volt trois, de filles("he of-them sees three, of girls")Wc I)osit an anah)gous tructure fbr NPs withthe determiner des in rule (d), i.e., a partitivestructure where, the quantifier is not st)ecified.
In-deed, cliticization in cn is possit)te (14d).
(14) d. il voit (h;s filles (he sees gMs)il en voit ("he of-theln sees")il en voit, des filles ("he o f  them sees, girls")In all structures described above, we postulatean N2 \[de\] which may be cliticized.
In that cruse,it leaves behind a "stranded" quantifier (except inthe e;use of rule (d), where that quantifier is null).4 Conclus ionOverall, the coverage of the CGF is comparable tothat of the ANLT grammar, although some, of thephenomena treated are different.
I'resently, theCGF can parse isolated sentences using a limited,though representative, hmM-compiled lexicon.
Inorder to analyse sentences occurring in real text,a large coverage lexicon is required.
