A Computational Framework for Composition in MultipleLinguistic DomainsE lvan  GS~menComputer  Engineering Depar tmentMiddle East  Technical University06531, Ankara, Turkeyelvan@lcsl .metu.edu.trAbst rac tWe describe a computational frameworkfor a grammar architecture in which dif-ferent linguistic domains uch as morphol-ogy, syntax, and semantics are treated notas separate components but compositionaldomains.
The framework is based onCombinatory Categorial Grammars and ituses the morpheme as the basic buildingblock of the categorial lexicon.1 In t roduct ionIn this paper, we address the problem of mod-elling interactions between different levels of lan-guage analysis.
In agglutinative languages, affixesare attached to stems to form a word that may cor-respond to an entire phrase in a language like En-glish.
For instance, in Turkish, word formation isbased on suffixation of derivational nd inflectionalmorphemes.
Phrases may be formed in a similarway (1).
(1) Yoksul-la~-t~r-zl-makta-larpoor-V-CAUS-PASS-ADV-PERS'(They) are being made poor (impoverished)'.In Turkish, there is a significant amount of in-teraction between morphology and syntax.
For in-stance, causative suffixes change the valence of theverb, mad the reciprocal suffix subcategorize the verbfor a noun phrase marked with the comitative case.Moreover, the head that a bound morpheme modi-fies may be not its stem but a compound head cross-ing over the word boundaries, e.g.,(2) iyi oku-mu~ ~ocukwell read-REL child'well-educated child'In (2), the relative suffix -mu~ (in past form ofsubject participle) modifies \[iyi oku\] to give thescope \[\[\[iyi oku\]mu~\] 9ocuk\].
If syntactic omposi-tion is performed after morphological composition,we would get compositions such as \[iyi \[okumu~6ocuk\]\] or \[\[iyi okurnu~\] ~ocuk\] which yield ill-formedsemantics for this utterance.As pointed out by Oehrle (1988), there is no rea-son to assume a layered grammatical rchitecturewhich has linguistic division of labor into compo-nents acting on one domain at a time.
As a computa-tional framework, rather than treating morphology,syntax and semantics in a cascaded manner, we pro-pose an integrated model to capture the high level ofinteraction between the three domains.
The model,which is based on Combinatory Categorial Gram-mars (CCG) (Ades and Steedman, 1982; Steedman,1985), uses the morpheme as the building block ofcomposition at all three linguistic domains.2 Morpheme-based  Compos i t ionsWhen the morpheme is given the same status asthe lexeme in terms of its lexical, syntactic, andsemantic ontribution, the distinction between theprocess models of morphotactics and syntax disap-pears.
Consider the example in (3).
(3) uzun kol-lu g5mleklong sleeve-ADJ shirtTwo different compositions 1 in CCG formalismare given in Figure 1.
Both interpretations are plau-sible, with (la) being the most likely in the absenceof a long pause after the first adjective.
To accountfor both cases, the suffix -lu must be allowed to mod-ify the head it is attached to (e.g., lb in Figure 1),or a compound head encompassing the word bound-aries (e.g., 1:~ in Figure 1).3 Mu l t i -domain  Combinat ionOperatorOehrle (1988) describes a model of multi-dimen-sional composition in which every domain Di hasan algebra with a finite set of primitive operations1Derived and basic categories in the examples are infact feature structures; ee section 4.We use ~ '~ to denote the combination of categoriesx and y giving the result z.302lexical entry syntactic ategory semantic ategory~z~n n/~ Ap.Zong(p( z ))kol n Ax.sleeve(x)-l~ (~1~) \ n ~q.x~.~(y, ha~(q))g5mlek n Aw.shirt(w)uzun kol .In gJmlek(la) ?

'(lb)~z~n kol -lu g6mlekn/nlong(shirt(y, has(sleeve(z)))) = 'a long shirt with sleeves'Figure 1: Scope ambiguity of a nominal bound mor-phemeFi.
As indicated by Turkish data in sections 1and 2,Fi may in fact have a domain larger than--but com-patible with--Di.In order to perform morphological nd syntacticcompositions in a unified framework, the slash oper-ators of Categorial Grammar must be enriched withthe knowledge about the type of process and thetype of morpheme.
We adopt a representation sim-ilar to Hoeksema nd Janda's (1988) notation forthe operator.
The 3-tuple <direction, morphemetype, process type> indicates direction 2 (left, right,unspecified), morpheme type (free, bound), andthe type of morphological or syntactic attachment(e.g., affix, clitic, syntactic concatenation, reduplica-tion).
Examples of different operator combinationsare given in Figure 2.4 In format ion Structure andTact ical  Constra intsEntries in the eategorial lexicon have tactical con-straints, grammatical nd semantic features, andphonological representation.
Similar to HPSG (Pol-lard and Sag, 1994), every entry is a signedattribute-value matrix.

phon represents he phonological string.
Lex-ical elements may have (a) phonemes, (b) mete-phonemes such as H for high vowel, and D for a dentalwhose voicing is not yet determined, and (c) optionalsegments, e.g., -(y)lA, to model vowel/consonantdrops, in the phon feature.
During composition,the surface forms of composed elements are mappedand saved in phon.
phon also allows efficient lexiconsearch.
For instance, the causative suffix -DHr haseight different realizations but only one lexical entry.Every res and arg feature has an f or p (property)sign:syn 1 pLSernjsyn and sere are the sources of grammatical (gsign) and semantic (s sign) properties, respectively.These properties include agreement features uch asperson, number, and possessive, and selectional re-303strictions:"cat typeformrestr <cond>$"person "numberpossnprop caserelativeform"reflexivereciprocalcausativepassivevprop tensemodalaspectpersonformrestr <cond>gA special feature value called none is used forimposing certain morphotactic onstraints, and tomake sure that the stem is not inflected with thesame feature more than once.
It also ensures,through syn constraints, that inflections are markedin the right order (cf., Figure 3).5 Conc lus ionTurkish is a language in which grammatical func-tions can be marked morphologically (e.g., case),or syntactically (e.g., indirect objects).
Semanticcomposition is also affected by the interplay of mor-phology and syntax, for instance the change in thescope of modifiers and genitive suffixes, or valencyand thematic role change in causatives.
To modelinteractions between domains, we propose a catego-rial approach in which composition in all domainsproceed in parallel.
As an implementation, we havebeen working on the modelling of Turkish causativesusing this framework.6 AcknowledgementsI would like to thank my advisor Cem Bozsahin forsharing his ideas with me.
