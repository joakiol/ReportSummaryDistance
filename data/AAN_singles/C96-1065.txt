15D-64293 Darmstadt ,  Germany{firzlaff,  kunz}@darmstadt .gmd.deAbst ractThe focus of this article is the integra-tion of two different perspectives on lexi-cal semantics: Discourse RepresentationTheory's (DRT) inferentially motivatedapproach and Semantic Emphasis The-ory's (SET) lexical field based view.
Anew joined representation format is de-veloped which is exemplified by anal-yses of German verbs.
The benefitsthereof are on both sides.
DI/T gainsbasic entries for whole lexical fields and,furtherlnore, a systematic interface be-tween semantic and syntactic argumentstructures.
SET profits both from themuch larger semantic overage and fromthe fine grained lexical analyses whichreflect inferential behaviour.1 In t roduct ionThe construction of lexical entries is one of thecrucial and challenging tasks given in the field ofcomputational linguistics.
In the ideal case, lexi-cal entries fulfill, among others, two requirements.First, the representations are suitably fine grainedsuch that they capture lexeme-speeific distinc-tions.
Second, the lexical entries are sufficientlygeneral, for reflecting similarities between singlelexemes.
Furthermore, the information they con-tain should systematically link various levels ofdescription, e.g.
syntax and semantics as well asreferential and inferential potential.
The latter isof special interest for text analysis as opposed tosentence analysis (eft for example (Haenelt, 1994);(Haenelt and KSnyves-Tdth, 1991)).Corresponding to these requirements, we ex-ploit the specific strengths of two distinct seman-tic theories.
These theories are Discourse Rep-resentation Theory (DRT) ((Kamp and Reyle,1993); (FraCaS-DS, 1994)) and Semantic Empha-sis Theory (SET)((Kunze, 1991); (Kunze, 1993)).However, our central goal is an integration of D113'and SET.
It will be shown that this integration ispossible and of benefit to both theories as well asto the construction of lexical entries.
To achieveour overall objective, the following four points willbe exemplified by joined representations of Ger-man verbs:?
DRT profits from SET's systematic deriva-tions of thematic roles and of morpho-syntaeticfeatures on the basis of predicate-argument-structures.
These features include both gram-matical and prepositional case.?
DRT gains a purely semantically motivated ori-entation towards lexical fields.?
Dll\[l' covers much more semantic phenomenathan SET.
Therefore, DI{T offers SET the pos-sibility to test its results against a semanticbackground that e.g.
includes plurals, tenses,and attitudes.?
DRT's fine grained lexical analyses aregrounded in inferential behaviour.
These lex-ical distinctions mark possible starting pointsfor refining SET's representations.The paper is structured as follows: DRT's andSET's basic motivations, principles and formalmeans concerning lexical semantics are retraced ~nsections 2 and 3.
The new joined representationformat is introduced in section 4 by analysing theGerman verbs leihen (in its variant to lend) andverschenken (in its variant to give as a present).Moreover, section 4 provides evidence that thefour main points stated above are backed up bythe joined analyses.
Finally, directions for furtherresearch are pointed out in section 5.2 DRT - -  In fe rent ia l l y  Mot ivatedDiscourse RepT~sentation Theory (DRT) is firstand foremost a theory about discourse interpre-tation, i.e., it is essentially textually orientedin natm'e.
The meaifing of sequences of sen-tences is seen as strongly connected with their382inferential behaviour.
Therefore, work on lexi-eal seinantics in tile Dll2F frmneworl?

Consequently, lexical distinctions correlatewith non-equiwflent sets of associated inference.s.The following ('.xalnt)les illustrate that the Ger-man verb leihen (in its variant to lend) implies in(:ontrast o the German vert) versehenken (in itsvariant to give as a present) the lending t)erson'sbelief in a return of the involved object,:(la) Calvin lciht IIobbes eine Krawatte.

A detailed lexicalrepresentation f leihe'n will be given in section 4.3 S E T  - - Lexical F ield BasedSemantic Emphasis Th.eory (SET) has identifiedprincit)les that allow to link a prototypical de-scription of a situation to a number of proto-typical meaning descriptions of con(:rete lexeines383that; are suitable to refer to that situation.
Thelink is based on a set of well-defined and sys-tematically occurring mappings (cf.
(Firzlaff andKunze, 1995)) rather than on intuitive criteria.Given a basic semantic form (BSF) as a cornmonstarting point, we derive semantic and syntacticcase frames and construct prototypical meaningdescriptions of concrete lexemes by refining theBSF.
Additionally, the rule based interpretationof a BSF delivers a prototypical description of thecorresponding situation.The set of lexemes that are suitable to referto the same situation constitutes a lexical field.The field as a whole is characterized by a BSF.
ABSF is a propositional description.
It consists ofa predicate and a nmnber of arguments, each ofwhich is either a predicate-argument structure oran elementary argunlent.
In general, elementaryarguments are represented by variables that haveto be filled in by phrases which denote referenceobjects (participants of a situation).The number of arguinents, as well as the de-cision whether the arguments are elementary orpropositional, both depend on tim predicate that,directly takes these arguments.
We derive theparticipants' ttminatic roles (deep cases) in accofdance with a set of general rules.
Semant;ically,each pair of a role and the predicate directly dom-inating an elementary argument demands partic-ular selectional features for that argument.
TheBSF describing the field of change-of-possession(with one object to be transihrred) and the de-rived deep cases are given in Figure 3.CAUSE r: (agens,act)(ACT(r) p:<source,have)ET q: (goal,have)(BEC(NOT(HAVE(p,u))) u:(from-obj,have)BEC(HAVE(q,u)))) u:(to-obj,have)Figure 3.
BSF and deel) cases.From both the syntactic and the semantic pointof view, the BSF delivers the maximum case frameof the lexemes that constitute the lexical field.Some of the roles of the maximum case frame canbe put into the foreground; these are said to havecmphasis.
Some roles nmst not be verbalized ex-plicitly; these are said to be blocked.
In the subsetof roles that are not blocked there are, on the onehand, roles referring to obligatory actants and, onthe other hand, roles referring to optional actants.Which roles have emphasis and which do not haveemphasis, which are the ones that must be verbal-ized, and which are the ones that need not be ver-balized is determined according to general rules.Exploiting the field specific possibilities to makesome variables denote the same reference object(by renaming of variables) results in more specificBSFs.
These then describe partial lexical fieldslike, e.g.
to give or to take.By adding infbrmation about, emphasis andblocking of roles, a BSF is transformed into a num-ber" of prototypieal meaning descriptions.
We canthen derive systematically which are the suitablegrammatical realizations of each role.
However,there are two important points concerning thedetermination of which grammatical realizationsare possible: Firstly, the predicate that takes thecorresponding elementary argument directly and,secondly, the choice of that subset of roles of timmaximum case frame that are not blocked.
One ofthe three prototypical ineaning descriptiolm thatconstitute the partial field of to 9ire and tile gram-rnatical case assiglmmnt of verschenke,n 1 is givenin Figure 4.

Prototypical ineaning description andgrammatical case assignments.However, BSFs do not only provide the groundfor the derivation of grammatical features.
Theyare also suitable to derive prototypieal situationdescriptions.
In order to do so, instantiation rulesmust be applied to a BSF in a recursive way.The application of instantiation ruh;s has to beregarded as an interpretation of every partial de-scription in a BSF.
Some of these parts are, thenrepresented by variables that have to be filled inby objects referring to states or (;vents, and otherparts deliver relationships between these states orevents.
In addition, some of the instantiation rulesprovide temt)oral and/or spatial constraints thatare applicable to (tim corresponding parts of) aprototypical situation description, e.g., etimc is amapping fl'om the set of events or states to the setof temporal entities (etime: g -+ T).In general, tile instantiation rules provide struc-1Generally, this grammatical case assignment issuitable for about 20 verbs of the partial field to give.2More precisely, there is a mapping front the set ofvariables into the set of nominal phrases (more gener-ally, parts of speech) f: V --+ b r.384CAUSE(ACT(p)ET(BEC(N()T(nAVE(p,.)))BEC(HAVE(q,u))))Presul)l)ositions:(,.

Because of the temporal identity of e21and e2~, there are temporal overlaps between theinitial states as well as between the final states.In the axiom defining CHANGE-SIGN's prestate,so's consequences sl and s2 correspond to init(e21)and init(e22).

The pa-rameter STATE is filled in by DISP&OWN whichis added to the predicate hierarchy sketched al-ready as a specialization of the predicate IIAVF.Thereby, it is possible to distinguish between thepure disposal and the disposal thai; is accompa-nied by ownership.Furthermore, verschenken's presupposition i -cludes the semantic roles delivered by its prototyp-ical meaning description.
However, the selectionalrestrictions for discourse referents do not differfrom the restrictions given in the prototypical sit-uation description (cf.
Figure 5).
With respect othe semantic interpretation, each of source-have,goal-have, and locat-have just means is suitable asfirst ar.qument in a IIAVE-proposition.
Generally,the predicate directly determines the selectionalrestrictions of its arguments, i.e., the discoursereferents.
Furthermore, for those predicates thattake more than one argument, it is the order ofthe arguments which additionally determines theselectional restrictibns.

Therefore, the transitions'initial states precede ec (so ::)(7_ ee) and the tran-sitions' final states follow ec (ec DC st).The lexical entry of leihen (in its variant tolend) consists of an interface list, whose thematicroles are based on SET, and of semantic struc-tures, which include and extend versehenken's se-mantic components.
The inferential behaviom' ofleihen (exemplified in section 2) motivates a for-real description that contains more than the basicdistinctions provided by the partial lexical field togive.
Additionally, there is the lending person'sbelief in a return of the involved object, in otherwords, the belief that the CHANGE-SIGN from s oto s~ is temporary.
Therefore, leihen's represen-tat, ions make use of CIIANGE-SIGN's subconceptCIIANGE-SIGN-TEMP.
This subconcept entails ;ttransformation of its superconcept's prestate So(so DC ec) to its superconcept's poststate s~ (eeDC sl) as well as the new poststate s2 (ec ~ s.e),i.e.
