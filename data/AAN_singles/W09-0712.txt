The third part  details  thecomplex morphology of this language.
In thepart 4 we describe the conversion of the dictio-nary into electronic form, the inflectional ruleswe wrote and their implementation in the Noojsoftware.
Finally we present a plan for our fu-ture work.1.
The Tamajaq language1.1 Socio-linguistic situationIn  Niger,  the  official  language  is  French  andthere  are  eleven  national  languages.
Five  aretaught  in  a  experimental  schools:  Fulfulde,Hausa, Kanuri, Tamajaq and So?ay-Zarma.According to the last census in 1998, the Tama-jaq language is spoken by 8,4% of the 13.5 mil-lion people who live in Niger.
This language isalso spoken in Mali, Burkina-Faso, Algeria andLibya.
It is estimated there are around 5 millionsTamajaq-speakers around the world.The Tamacheq language belongs to the group ofBerber languages.1.2 Tamajaq alphabetThe Tamajaq alphabet used in Niger (Republicof Niger, 1999) uses 41 characters, 14 with dia-critical marks that all figure in the Unicode stan-dard (See appendix A).
There are 12 vowels: a, ?,?, ?, e, ?, i, ?, o, ?, u, ?.1.3 Articulary phoneticsConsonants Voiceless VoicedBilabial Plosive bNasal mTrill rSemivowel wLabiodental Fricative fDental Plosive t dFricative s zNasal nLateral lPharyngeal Plosive ?

2008).2 Lexicographic resourcesWe use the school editorial dictionary "diction-naire Tamajaq-fran?ais destin?
?
l'enseignementdu  cycle  de  base  1".
It  was  written  by  theSOUTEBA1 project of the DED2 organisation in2006.
Because it targets children, this dictionaryconsists only of 5,390 entries.
Words have beenchosen by compiling school books.2.1 Structure of an entryEach entry generally details :- lemma,- lexical category,- translation in French,- an example,- gender (for nouns),- plural form (for nouns).Examples:?
?bada1: sn.

2Table 2: Tamajaq lexical categories3 MorphologyThe Tamajaq language presents a rich morpholo-gy (Aghali-Zakara, 1996).3.1 Verbal morphologyVerbs are classified according to the number ofconsonants of their lexical root and then in dif-ferent types.
There are monoliteral, biliteral trilit-eral, quadriliteral verbs...Three moods are distinguished: imperative, sim-ple injunctive and  intense injunctive.Three aspects present different possible values:- accomplished: intense or negative;82- non accomplished: simple, intense or negative;- aorist  future: simple or negative.Examples :?kt?b (to write): triliteral verb, type 1.???
?n (to know): triliteral verb, type 2 (??n).
?m?l (to say): biliteral verb, type 1ak?r (to steal): biliteral verb, type 2aw?y (to carry): biliteral verb, type 3a?wu (to drink): biliteral verb, type 4aru (to love): monoliteral verb, type 2aru (to open): monoliteral verb, type 3Each class of verb has its own rules of conjuga-tion.3.2 Nominal morphologya.
Simple nounsNouns present three characteristics:- gender: masculine or feminine;- number: singular or plural;- annexation state is marked by the change of thefirst vowel.Terminology Abbreviationt?must gender tmt.yey masculine yy.t?nte feminine tnt.awd?kki singular wdk.iget plural gt.

Akku: abl??n?2.
t?must.
:  yy.
?s?fs?s.
:  ?.
Ig?t:??r?kkat?n.
?
"a?r?kka"  is  a  masculine  noun.
Its  plural  is"??r?kkat?n".
It  becomes  "?
?r?kka"  whenannexation state is expressed.The plural form of nouns is not regular and hasto be specifically listed.b.
Complex nounsComplex nouns are composed by several lexicalunits connected together by hyphens.
It could in-clude nouns, determiners or prepositions as wellas verbs.Examples:Noun +determiner + noun"eja?-n-?j?an", literally means "donkey ofbirds" (this is the name of a bird).Verb + noun"aw?y-?hu?"
literally  means  "it  followsharmattan" (kite)."ga?
?ay-t?fuk" literally means "it looks atsun" (sunflower).Preposition + noun"In-tama?"
means "the one of the tree aca-cia"  (of acacia).Verb + verb"az?l-az?l" means "run run"  (return).We counted 238 complex nouns in the studieddictionary.4 Natural  Language  Processing  ofTamajaq4.1 Nooj software (Silberztein, 2007)?
Nooj is a linguistic development environmentthat includes tools to create and maintain large-coverage lexical  resources,  as  well  as  morpho-logical and syntactic grammars.
?
This softwareis specifically designed for linguists who can useit to test hypothesis on real corpus.
?
Dictionariesand grammars are applied to texts in order to lo-cate morphological, lexical and syntactic patternsand tag simple and compound words.
?
Nooj putall possible tags for each token or group of to-kens but does not disambiguate between the mul-tiple  possibilities.
However,  the  user  can  buildhis own grammar to choose between the multiplepossible tags.
The analysis can be displayed as asyntactic tree.This software is supported by Windows.We chose to construct resources for this softwarebecause it is fully compatible with Unicode.4.2 Construction of the dictionaryWe convert  the  edited  dictionary  for  the  Noojsoftware.3,463 simple nouns, 128 complex nouns, 46 ad-jectives and 33 verbo-nouns are given with theirplural form.
Annexation state is indicated for 98783nouns, 23 complex nouns, 2 adjectives and 7 ver-bo-nouns.We  created  morphological  rules  that  we  ex-pressed as Perl  regular  expressions and also inthe Nooj format (with the associated tag).a.
Annexation state rulesThirteen  morphological  rules  calculate  the  an-nexation state.Examples:The 'A1?'
rule replaces the first letter of theword by '?'.'A1?'
ruleNooj <LW><S>?/sfssPerl ^.(.
*)$ ?
?$1Table 4: Rule 'A1?
'The 'A2 '  rule  replaces  the  second letter  of?the word by ' '.?
'A2 ' rule?Nooj A2 =<LW><R><S> /sfss?
?Perl ^(.).(.
*)$ ?
$1 $2?Table 5: Rule 'A2 '?b.
Plural form rulesWe searched formal rules to unify the calculationof plural forms.
We found 126 rules that fit from2 up to 446 words.
2932 words could be associat-ed with, at least, one flexional rule.Examples:'I4' rule deletes the last letter, adds "-?n" atthe end and "i-" at the beginning.Nooj I4=?n<LW><S>i/IgetPerl ^(.
*).$ ?
i$1?n# 446 wordsTable 6: Rule 'I4''I2' rule deletes the last and the second lettersand includes "-en" at the end and "-i-" in thesecond position.Nooj I2=<B>en<LW><R><S>i/IgetPerl ^(.).(.
*).$ ?
$1i$2en# 144 wordsTable 7: Rule 'I2''I45'  rule deletes the final letter and include"-en" at the end.Nooj I45=<B>en/IgetPerl ^(.
*).$ ?
<B>en/Iget# 78 wordsTable 8: Rule 'I45''I102'  rule deletes the two last letters and thesecond one and includes a final "-a" and a"-i-" in the second position.Nooj I102=<B2>a<LW><R><S>i/IgetPerl ^(.).(.
*)..$ ?
$1i$2a# 6 wordsTable 9: Rule 'I102'c.
Combined rulesWhen  it  was  necessary,  the  above  rules  havebeen combined to  calculate  singular  and pluralforms with or without annexation state.We thus finally obtained 319 rules.Example:I2RA2?
=:Rwdk + :I2 + :Rwdk :A2?
+ :I2 :A2?Fig.
1: Rule I2RA2?This  rule  recognizes  the  singular  form(:Rwdk),  the  plural  form  (:I2),  the  singularform with the annexation state (:Rwdk :A2?
)and  the plural form with the annexation state(:I2 :A2?
).25 words meet this rule.For  instance,  "ta?l?mt"  (accusation,  provoca-tion), is inflected in:- ta?l?mt,ta?l?mt,SN+tnt+wdk- ti?l?men,ta?l?mt,SN+tnt+Iget- t?
?l?men,ta?l?mt,SN+tnt+Iget+sfss84- t??l?mt,ta?l?mt,SN+tnt+wdk+sfssd.
Conjugaison rulesVerb classes are not indicated in the dictionary.We only describe a few conjugaison rules, just tocheck the expressivity of the Nooj softwareHere is the rule of the verb "???
?n" (to know),intense  accomplished  aspect,  represented  as  atransducer.Fig.
2: Verb "???
?n",  intense accomplished aspectWe obtain, in the inflected dictionary, the correctconjugated forms.???ana?+????n,V+accompli+wdk+1t???ana?+????n,V+accompli+wdk+2i??an+????n,V+accompli+wdk+yy+3t???an+????n,V+accompli+wdk+tnt+3n???an+????n,V+accompli+gt+1t???anam+????n,V+accompli+gt+yy+2t???anmat+????n,V+accompli+gt+tnt+2???anan+????n,V+accompli+gt+yy+3???annat+????n,V+accompli+gt+tnt+3e.
Irregular wordsFinally,  the singular  and plural  forms  of  2,457words were explicitly written in the Nooj dictio-nary because they do not follow any regular rule.Examples:Singular Plural Translationag-awnaf kel-awnaf touristaman o?

ResultThere are 6,378 entries in the Nooj dictionary.The  inflected  dictionary,  calculated  from  theabove  dictionary  and  with  the  inflectional  andconjugation rules, encounters 11,223 entries.Nooj  is  able  to  use  the  electronic  dictionarywe've created to automatically tag a text (see anexample in appendix B).4.3 Future worka Conversion into XML formatWe will  convert the inflectional dictionary intothe  international  standard  Lexical  MarkupFramework format  (Francopoulo and al.,  2006)in order to make it easily usable by other TALNapplication,.b Automatic search of rulesDue to the high morphological complexity of theTamajaq  language,  we  plan  to  develop  a  Perlprogram that would automatically determine thederivational and conjugation rules.c Completion and correction of the resourceThe linguistic resource will be completed duringthe next months in order to add the class of verbsthat are absent for the moment, and also to cor-rect the errors that we noticed during this study.d Enrichment of the resourceWe plan to construct a corpus of school texts toevaluate the out-of-vocabulary rate of this dictio-nary.
This corpus could then be used to enrichthe  dictionary.
The  information  given  by Noojwould be useful to choose the words to add.85AcknowledgementSpecial thanks to John Johnson, reviewer of this text.ReferencesAghali-Zakara  M. 1996.

U+1E9287APPENDIX B : Nooj tagging Tamajaq textNooj perfectly recognizes the four forms of theword "aw?qqas" (big cat) in the text:"aw?qqas,  iwa?san, awa?san"These forms are listed in the inflectional dictio-nary as:aw?qqas,aw?qqas,SN+yy+wdkaw?qqas,aw?qqas,SN+yy+wdk+FLX=A1a+sfssiwa?san,aw?qqas,SN+yy+igetawa?san,aw?qqas,SN+yy+iget+FLX=A1a+sfssFig.3: Tags on the text "aw?qqas, iwa san,?
awa san"?On the figure 3, we can see that the first token"aw?qqas" gets two tags:- "aw?qqas,SN+yy+wdk" (singular)- "aw?qqas,SN+yy+wdk+sfss"  (singular  andannexation state).The  second  and  third  tokens  get  a  unique  tagbecause there is no ambiguity.88
