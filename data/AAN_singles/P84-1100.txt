68Universit~ de Grenoble38402 Saint-Martin d'H~resFRANCEABSTRACTOur MT systems integrate many advanced con-cepts from the fields of computer science, linguis-tics, and AI : specialized languages for linguisticprogramming based on production systems, completelinguistic programming environment, multilevelrepresentations, organization of the lexiconsaround "lexical units", units of translation of thesize of several paragraphs, possibility of usingtext-driven heuristic strategies.We are now beginning to integrate new techni-ques : unified design of an "integrated" lexicaldata-base containing the lexicon in "natural" and"coded" form, use of the "static grammars" forma-lism as a specification language, addition ofexpert systems equipped with "extralinguistic" or"metalinguistic" knowledge, and design of a kindof structural metaeditor (driven by a staticgrammar) allowing the interactive construction ofa document in the same way as syntactic editorsare used for developing programs.
We end the paperby mentioning some projects for long-term research.INTRODUCTIONIn this paper, we assume some basic knowledgeof CAT (Computer Aided Translation) terminology(MT, M.AHT, HAMT, etc.).
The starting point of ourresearch towards "better" CAT systems is brieflyreviewed in I.
In II, we present 3 lines of currentwork : improving current second-generation metho-dology by incorporating advanced techniques fromsoftware engineering, moving toward third-genera-tion systems by incorporating expert systems, andreturning to interactive techniques for thecreation of a document.1 - IMPORTANT CONCEPTS FROM EXISTING SYSTEMSFor lack of space, we only list our majorpoints, and refer the reader to (3,4,5,6,15) forfurther details.!
- Computer science aspectsi) Use of Specialized Languages for LinguisticProgramming (SLLP), like ATEF, ROBRA, Q-systems,REZO, etc.2) Integration in some "user-friendly" envi-ronment, controlled by a conversational interface,and managing a specialized data-base composed ofwhat we call "lln~-~are" (grammars, dictionaries,procedures, formats, variables~ andcorpuses of texts (source, translated, revised,plus intermediate results and possibly"hors-textes" -- figures, etc.
).3) Analogy with compiler-compiler systems :rough translation is realized by a monolingualanalysis, followed by a bilingual transfer, andthen by a monolingual generation (synthesis).2 - Linguistic aspectsI) Only linguistic levels (of morphology,syntax, logico-semantics, modality, actualisation,...) are used, leading to some implicit understan-ding, characteristic of second-generation MTsystems.2) Hence, the extralinguistic levels (ofexpertise and pragmatics) which furnish somedegree of explicit understanding are beyond thelimits of second-generation CAT systems.3) During analysis of a unit of translation,computation of these (linguistic) levels is notdone sequentially, but in a cooperative way.Analysis produces the analog of an "abstract tre@'~namely a multilevel interface structure to repre-sent all the computed levels on the same graph(a "decorated tree").4) Lexical knowledge is organized around thenotion of lexical unit (LU), allowing for powerfulparaphrasing capability.5) The texts are segmented into translationunits of one or more paragraphs.
This allows forintersentential resolution of anaphora in somenot too difficult cases.3 - AI aspectsI) During the structural steps, the unit oftranslation is represented by the current "objecttree", which may encode several competing interpre-tations, like the "blackboard" of some AI systems.2)This and the SLLPs' control structuresallow for some heuristic programming : it ispossible to explicitly describe and process ambi-guous situations in the production rules.This is in contrast to systems based on combi-natorial algorithms which construct each interpre-tation independently, even if they represent themin a factorized way.468II - DIRECTIONS OF CURRENT WORKI - Linguistic knowledge processingThe experience gained by the development of aRussian-French translation unit of a realistic sizeover the last three years (6) has shown that main-taining and upgrading the lingware, even in anadmittedly limited second generation CAT system,requires a good deal of expertise.
Techniques arenow being developed to maintain the linguisticknowledge base.
Some of them deal with the lexicaldata-base, others with the definition and use ofspecification formalisms ("static grammars") andverification tools.Lexical knowledge processin~In the long run, dictionaries turn out to bethe costliest components of CAT systems.
Hence, weare working towards the reconciliation of "natural"and "coded" dictionaries, and towards the construc-tion of automated verification and indexing tools.Natural dictionaries are usually accessed bylemmas (normal forms).
Coded dictionaries of CATsystems, on the other hand, are accessed by morphsor by lexical units.
Moreover, the information thetwo types of dictionaries contain is not the same.However, it is highly desirable to maintain somedegree of coherency between the coded dictionariesof a CAT system and the natural dictionaries whichconstitute their source, for documentation purposes,and also because these computerized natural dictio-naries should be made accessible to the revisors.Let us briefly present the kind of structureproposed by N. Nedobejkine and Ch.
Boitet at anATALA meeting in Paris in \]983.
The central ideahere is to start from the structure of moderndictionaries, which are accessed by the lemmas, butuse the notion of lexical unit.
Each item may beconsidered as a tree structure.
Starting from thetop, selections of a "local" nature (on thesyntactico-semantic behavior in a phrase or in asentence) give access to the "constructions".
Then,more "global" constraints lead to "word senses".At each node, codes of one or more formalizedmodels may be grafted on.
Hence, it is in principlepossible to index directly in this structure, andthen to design programs to construct the codeddictionaries in the formats expected by the variousSLLP.
Up to this level, the information is monolin-gual and'usable for analysis as well as for genera-tion.
If the considered language is source in oneor more language pairs, each word sense may befurther refined, for each target language, and leadto equivalents expressed as constructions of thetarget language, with all other information contai-ned in the dictionary constructed in a similar wayfor the target language.
For lack of space, wecannot include examples.This part of the work thus aims at findinga good way of representing lexical knowledgeBut there is another problem, perhaps even moreimportant.
Because of the cost of building machinedictionaries, we need some way to transform andtransport lexical knowledge from one CAT system toanother.
This is obviously a problem of translation.Hence, we consider this type of "integrated struc-ture" as a possible lexical interface structure.Research has recently begun on the possibility ofusing classical or advanced data base systems tostore this lexical knowledge and to implement thevarious tools required for addition and verifica-tion.
VlSULEX and ATLAS (1) are first versions ofsuch tools.Gran~atical knowledge processingJust as in current software engineering, wehave long felt the need for some level of "static"(algebraic) specification of the functions to berealized by algorithms expressed in proceduralprogramming languages.
In the case of CAT systems,there is no a priori correct gran~,ar of thelanguage, and natural language is inherently ambi-guous.
Hence, any usable specification must specifya relation (not a function) between strings andtrees~ or trees and trees : many trees may corres-pond to one string, and, conversely, many stringsmay correspond to one tree.Working with B. Vauquois in this direction,S.
Chappuy has developed a formalism of static~rammars (7), presented in charts expressing therelation between strings of terminal elements(usually decorations expressing the result of somemorphological analysis) and multilevel structuraldescriptors.
This formalism is currently beingused for all new linguistic developments at GETA.Of course, this is not a completely new idea.
Forexample, M. Kay (|3) proposed the formalism ofunification grammars for quite the same purpose.But his formalism is more algebraic and lessgeometric in nature, and we prefer to use a speci-fication in terms of the kind of structures we areaccustomed to manipulating.2 - Grafting o n expert systemsSeeing that linguistic expertise is alreadyquite well represented and handled in current("closed") systems, we are orienting our researchtowards the possibility of addin~ extralinguisticknowledge (knowledge about some technical or scien-tific field, for instance) to existing CAT systems.Also, because current systems are based on trans-ducers rather than on analyzers, it is perfectlypossible that the result of analysis or of transfer(the "structural descriptors") are partiallyincorrect and need correction.
Knowledge about thetypes of errors made by linguistic systems may becalled metalinsuistic.In his recent thesis (9), R. Gerber hasattempted to design such a system, and to proposean initial implementation.
The expertise to beincorporated in this system includes linguistic,metalinguistic, and extralinguistic knowledge.
Thesystem is constructed by combining a "closed"system, based only on linguistic knowledge (a ling-ware written in ARIANE-78), and two "open"systems, called "expert corrector systems".
Thefirst is inserted at the junction between analysisand transfer, and the second between transfer andgeneration.469The control structure of a corrector systemis as follows :(1) transform the result of analysis into asuitable form ;(2) while there is some error configuration dosolve (using meta- or extralinguistieknowledge) ;i f  solving has failed then exit endif ;(4) perform a partial reconstruction of thestructure, according to the solution found ;endwhile ;(5) output the final structure in ARIANE-78 format.
(2) relies on metalinguistic knowledge only.The implementation has been done in FolI-PROLOG(8).
The lingware used corresponds to a smallEnglish-French system developed for teaching pur-poses.
Here are some examples.Example I : ADJ + N N(1) Standard free-energy change is calculated bythis equation.The analyzer proposes that "standard"modifies"change", while "free-energy" is juxtaposed to"change", hence the erroneous translation :"La variable standard d'~nergie libre est calcul~epar cette formule".In order to correct the structure, someknowledge of chemistry is required, namely that"standard free-energy change" is a ... standardnotion.
With this grouping, (1) translates as :"La variation d'finergie libre standard est calcul~epar cette formule".Example 2 : (ADJ) N and N N(2) The mixture gives off dangerous cyanide andchlorine fumes.
(2') The experiment requires carbon and nitrogentetraoxyde.Let us develop this example a little more.Sentence (2) presents the problem of determiningthe scope of the coordination.
The result of ana-lysis (tree n ?
2) groups "dangerous cyanide" andchlorine fumes", "chlorine" being juxtaposed to"fumes" (SF(JUXT) on node 12).
Hence thetranslation :"La preparation d~gage le cyanure et la vapeur dechlore dangereux".But, if we know that cyanide is dangerous asfumes, and not as crystals, we can correct thestructure by grouping "(cyanide and chlorine)fumes" (see subtree n ?
2).
The translationproduced will then be :"La preparation d~gage la vapeur dangereuse decyanure et de chlore".Of course, some more sophisticated analyzerswould (and some actually do) use the semantic mar-ker "chemical element" present on both "chlorine"and "cyanide", and then group them on the basis ofthe " semantlc density" (e.g., number of featuresshared).
But this technique will fail on (2'),because there is no "carbon tetraoxyde" in normalchemistry !
Hence, without extralinguisticknowledge, this more sophisticated (linguistic)strategy will produce :"L'expfirience demande du t~traoxyde de carbone etd'azote".instead of :"L'expfirience demande du carbone et du tfitraoxyded'azote".RESULTAT DE L'EXECUTION.

15Example 3 : Antecedent of "which"(3) The water in the beaker with which the chlorinecombines will the poisonous.The analyzer takes "beaker" instead of"water"as antecedent of "which".
The corrector may knowthat chlorine combines with water, and not with abeaker.Examples 4 & 5 : Antecedent of "it" within orbeyond the same sentence(4) The state in which a substance is depends onthe energy that it contains.
When a substance isheated the energy of the substance is increased.
(5) The particles vibrate more vigorously, and itbecomes a liquid.
(5') It melts.470In order to choose between "substance" and"state" (4), one must make some type of complexreasoning using detailed knowledge of physics --and one may easily fail in a given context : it isnot correct to simply state (as we did to solvethis particular case), that a substance may possessenergy, while a state cannot.
Here, perhaps it isbetter to rely on some (metalinguistic) informationon the typology, which may be included in a (spe-cialized) linguistic analyzer, or in the expert cor-rector system.
For (5), there are simple, butpowerful rules like : if the antecedent cannot befound in the sentence, look for the nearestpossible main clause subject to the left.3 - Aiding the creation of the source documentsLingware engineering may be compared withmodern software engineering, because it requiresthe design and implementation of complete program-ming systems, uses specification tools, and leadsto research in automatic program generation.
Star-ting from this analogy, a group of researchers atGETA have recently embarked on a project whichcould converge with still another line of softwareengineering, in a very interesting way.
The finalaim is to design and implement a syntactic~semanticstructural metaeditor that uses a static grammargiven as parameter in order to guide an author whois writing a document, in much the same manner asmetaeditors like MENTOR are used for writing pro-grams in classical programming languages.This could offer an attractive alternative tointeractive CAT systems like ITS, which require aspecialist to assist the system during the transla-tion process.
As a matter of fact, this principlei~ a sophisticated variant of the "controlledsyntax" idea, like that implemented in the TITUSsystem.
Its essential advantage is to guarantee thecorrectness of the intermediate structure, withoutthe need for a large domain-specific knowledge base.It may be added that, in many cases, the documentsbeing written are in effect contributing some newknowledge to the domain of discourse, which hen-c~cecannot already be present in the computerizedknowledge base, even if one exists.III - CONCLUSION : SOME LONG TERM PERSPECTIVESThere are many areas open for future researchThe introduction of "static grammars" suggests anew kind of design, where the "dynamic grammars"would be generated from the specifications and fromsome strategies, possibly expressed as "met~-uules".
"Multisliced decorated trees" (16) have beenintroduced as a data structure for the explicitfactorization of decorated trees.
However, thereremains to develop a full implementation of theassociated parallel rewriting rule system, STAR-PALE, and to test its linguistic practicability.Last but not least, the development of true"translation expert systems" requires an intensive(psycholinguistic) study of the expertise used byhuman translators and revisors.REFERENCES(I) Bachut D. - V~rast~gui N.
