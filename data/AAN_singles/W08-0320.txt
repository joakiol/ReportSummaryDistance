Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 147?150,Columbus, Ohio, USA, June 2008. c?2008 Association for Computational LinguisticsImproving English-Spanish Statistical Machine Translation: Experiments inDomain Adaptation, Sentence Paraphrasing, Tokenization, and RecasingPreslav Nakov?EECS, CS divisionUniversity of California at BerkeleyBerkeley, CA 94720nakov@cs.berkeley.eduAbstractWe describe the experiments of the UC Berke-ley team on improving English-Spanish ma-chine translation of news text, as part of theWMT?08 Shared Translation Task.
We ex-periment with domain adaptation, combin-ing a small in-domain news bi-text and alarge out-of-domain one from the Europarlcorpus, building two separate phrase transla-tion models and two separate language mod-els.
We further add a third phrase transla-tion model trained on a version of the newsbi-text augmented with monolingual sentence-level syntactic paraphrases on the source-language side, and we combine all models ina log-linear model using minimum error ratetraining.
Finally, we experiment with differ-ent tokenization and recasing rules, achieving35.09% Bleu score on the WMT?07 news testdata when translating from English to Span-ish, which is a sizable improvement over thehighest Bleu score achieved on that datasetat WMT?07: 33.10% (in fact, by our sys-tem).
On the WMT?08 English to Spanishnews translation, we achieve 21.92%, whichmakes our team the second best on Bleu score.1 IntroductionModern Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) sys-tems are trained on sentence-aligned bilingual cor-pora, typically from a single domain.
When testedon text from that same domain, they demonstrate?After January 2008 at the Linguistic Modeling Depart-ment, Institute for Parallel Processing, Bulgarian Academy ofSciences, nakov@lml.bas.bgstate-of-the art performance, but on out-of-domaintest data the results can get significantly worse.
Forexample, on the WMT?06 Shared Translation Task,the scores for French to English translation droppedfrom about 30 to about 20 Bleu points for nearly allsystems when tested on News Commentary ratherthan Europarl text, which was used on training(Koehn and Monz, 2006).Therefore, in 2007 the Shared Task organizersprovided 1M words of bilingual News Commentarytraining data in addition to the 30M Europarl data,thus inviting interest in domain adaptation experi-ments.
Given the success of the idea, the same taskwas offered this year with slightly larger training bi-texts: 1.3M and 32M words, respectively.2 System ParametersThe team of the University of California at Berkeley(ucb) participated in the WMT?08 Shared Transla-tion Task with two systems, English?Spanish andSpanish?English, applied to translatingNews Com-mentary text, for which a very limited amount oftraining data was provided.
We experimented withdomain adaptation, combining the provided smallin-domain bi-text and the large out-of-domain onefrom the Europarl corpus, building two phrase trans-lation models and two language models.
We furtheradded a third phrase translation model trained on aversion of the news bi-text augmented with mono-lingual sentence-level syntactic paraphrases on thesource-language side, and we combined all modelsin one big log-linear model using minimum errorrate training.
We also experimented with differenttokenization and recasing ideas.1472.1 Sentence-Level Syntactic ParaphrasesThe idea of using paraphrases is motivated by theobservation that, in many cases, the testing textcontains pieces that are equivalent, but syntacti-cally different from the phrases learned on train-ing, which might result in missing the opportu-nity for a high-quality translation.
For example, anEnglish?Spanish SMT system could have an entryin its phrase table for inequality of income, but notfor income inequality.
Note that the latter phraseis hard to translate into Spanish where noun com-pounds are rare: the correct translation in this caserequires a suitable Spanish preposition and a re-ordering, which are hard for the system to realizeand do properly.
We address this problem by gen-erating nearly-equivalent syntactic paraphrases ofthe source-side training sentences, targeted at nouncompounds.
We then pair each paraphrased sen-tence with the foreign translation associated with theoriginal sentence in the training data.
The resultingaugmented bi-text is used to train an SMT system,which learns many useful new phrases.
The ideawas introduced in (Nakov and Hearst, 2007), and isdescribed in more detail in (Nakov, 2007).Unfortunately, using multiple paraphrased ver-sions of the same sentence changes the word fre-quencies in the training bi-text, thus causing worsemaximum likelihood estimates, which results in badsystem performance.
However, real improvementscan still be achieved by merging the phrase tables ofthe two systems, giving priority to the original.2.2 Domain AdaptationIn our previous findings (Nakov and Hearst, 2007),we found that using in-domain and out-of-domainlanguage models is the best way to perform do-main adaptation.
Following (Koehn and Schroeder,2007), we further used two phrase tables.2.3 Improving the RecaserOne problem we noticed with the default recasingis that unknown words are left in lowercase.
How-ever, many unknown words are in fact named en-tities (persons, organization, or locations), whichshould be spelled capitalized.
Therefore, we pre-pared a new recasing script, which makes sure thatall unknown words keep their original case.2.4 Changing Tokenization/DetokenizationWe found the default tokenizer problematic: itkeeps complex adjectives as one word, e.g., well-rehearsed, self-assured, Arab-Israeli.
While lin-guistically correct, this is problematic for machinetranslation due to data sparsity.
For example, theSMT system might know how to translate into Span-ish both well and rehearsed, but not well-rehearsed,and thus at translation time it would be forced tohandle it as an unknown word.
A similar problemis related to double dashes ?--?, as illustrated by thefollowing training sentence: ?So the question nowis what can China do to freeze--and, if possible, toreverse--North Korea?s nuclear program.
?Therefore, we changed the tokenizer, so that itputs a space around ?-?
and ?--?.
We also changed thedetokenizer accordingly, adding some rules for fix-ing erroneous output, e.g., making sure that in Span-ish text ?
and ?, ?
and !
match.
We also added somerules for numbers, e.g., the English 1,185.32 shouldbe spelled as 1.185,32 in Spanish.3 The UCB SystemAs Table 1 shows, we performed many experimentsvarying different parameters of the system.
Due tospace limitations, here we will only describe our bestsystem, news10?euro10?par10.To build the system, we trained three separatephrase-based SMT systems (max phrase lengths 10):on the original News Commentary corpus (news),on the paraphrased version of News Commentary(par), and on the Europarl dataset (euro).
As a re-sult, we obtained three phrase tables, Tnews, Tpar,and Teuro, and three lexicalized reordering models,Rnews, Rpar, and Reuro, which we had to merge.First, we kept all phrase pairs from Tnews.
Thenwe added those phrase pairs from Teuro which werenot present in Tnews.
Finally, we added to themthose from Tpar which were not in Tnews nor inTeuro.
For each phrase pair added, we retained its as-sociated features: forward phrase translation proba-bility, reverse phrase translation probability, forwardlexical translation probability, reverse lexical trans-lation probability, and phrase penalty.
We furtheradded three new features ?
Pnews, Peuro, and Ppar ?each of them was 1 if the phrase pair came from thatsystem, and 0.5 otherwise.148BLEU Toke- News Comm.

Column 1 provides a brief description of the model used.
Herewe use euro, news and par to refer to using phrase tables extracted from the Europarl, the News Commentary, or theParaphrased News Commentary training bi-text; the index indicates the maximum phrase length allowed.
The?
oper-ation means the phrase tables are merged, giving priority to the left one and using additional features indicating whereeach phrase pair came from, while the+ operation indicates the phrase tables are used together without priorities.
Themodels using the + operation are marked with a ?
as a reminder that the involved phrase tables are used together, asopposed to being priority-merged.
Note also that the models from II.3.1.
only use the Spanish part of the Europarltraining data to build an out-of-domain language model; this is not indicated in column 1, but can be seen in column10.
Columns 2 and 3 show the testing Bleu score after applying the Default Recaser (DR) and the Improved Recaser(IR), respectively.
Column 4 shows whether the default or the new tokenizer was used.
Columns 5, 6 and 7 contain theparameters of the News Commentary training data: maximum length of the training sentences used (slen), maximumlength of the extracted phrases (plen), and order of the language model (LM), respectively.
Columns 8, 9 and 10 con-tain the same parameters for the Europarl training data.
Column 11 shows the number of iterations the MERT tuningtook, and column 12 gives the corresponding tuning Bleu score achieved.
Finally, for the WMT?08 competition, weused the system marked in bold.149We further merged Rnews, Reuro, and Rpar ina similar manner: we first kept all phrases fromRnews, then we added those from Reuro which werenot present in Rnews, and finally those from Rparwhich were not in Rnews nor in Reuro.We used two language models with Kneser-Neysmoothing: a 3-gram model trained on News Com-mentary, and a 5-gram model trained on Europarl.We then trained a log-linear model using the fol-lowing feature functions: language model proba-bilities, word penalty, distortion cost, and the pa-rameters from the phrase table.
We set the featureweights by optimizing the Bleu score directly usingminimum error rate training (Och, 2003) on the de-velopment set.
We used these weights in a beamsearch decoder to produce translations for the testsentences, which we compared to the WMT?07 goldstandard using Bleu (Papineni et al, 2002).4 Results and DiscussionTable 1 shows the evaluation results using theWMT?07 News Commentary test data.
Our bestEnglish?Spanish system news10?euro10?par10(see the table caption for explanation of the nota-tion), which is also our submission, achieved 35.09Bleu score with the improved recaser; with the de-fault recaser, the score drops to 34.85.Due to space limitations, our Spanish?Englishresults are not in Table 1.
This time, we did not useparaphrases, and our best system news10?euro10achieved 35.78 and 35.17 Bleu score with the im-proved and the default recaser, respectively.As the table shows, using the improved recaseryields consistent improvements by about 0.3 Bleupoints.
Using an out-of-domain language modeladds about 2 additional Bleu points, e.g., news10improves from 32.53 to 34.26, and news10?par10improves from 32.34 to 34.71.
The impact ofalso adding an out-of-domain phrase table is tiny:news10?euro7 improves on news10 by 0.05 only.Adding paraphrases however can yield an absoluteimprovement of about 0.6, e.g., 34.31 vs. 34.97for news10?euro7 and news10?euro7?par10.
Inter-estingly, using an out-of-domain phrase table has abigger impact when paraphrases are used, e.g., fornews10?par10 and news10?euro7?par10 we have34.71 and 34.97, respectively.
Finally, we were sur-prised to find out that using the new tokenizer doesnot help: for news10 the default tokenizer yields32.67, while the new one only achieves 32.53.
Thisis surprising for us, since the new tokenizer used tohelp consistent on the WMT?06 data.5 Conclusions and Future WorkWe described the UCB system for the WMT?08Shared Translation Task.
By combining in-domainand out-of-domain data, and by using sentence-level syntactic paraphrases and a better recaser, weachieved an improvement of almost 2 Bleu points1over the best result on the WMT?07 test data2,and the second best Bleu score for this year?sEnglish?Spanish translation of news text.In future work, we plan a deeper analysis of theobtained results.
First, we would like to experimentwith new ways to combine data from different do-mains.
We also plan to further improve the recaser,and to investigate why the new tokenizer did not helpfor the WMT?07 data.ReferencesPhilipp Koehn and Christof Monz.
