Fimdly,conclusion remarks are stated in Section 7.2 ALT-J/E: A Br ie f  Overv iewALT-.I/E, the Automatic Language Trlmslator:Japanese to English, is one of the most &dvitll(:(}dand well-recognized systems for translating ,htpaneseto English.
It is the largest such system in terms ofthe iunount of knowledge it compris(~s.
In this work,we are concerned with the li)llowing components o\['the ALT- J /E  system:1.
The Semantic lliera.rchy,2.
The Semantic Dictionary, and3.
Tile Translation l{ules.We briefly describe each of these COmln)nents be-low.
For more details al)out the AI,T-.I/E sys-tem, we refer the reader to \[lkehara et M. 1989,Ikehara et al 1990, ikehara et al 1991\].As shown in l"igam~ 1, the Semant ic  l t ie rarchyis it SOFt of colt(:el)t t}l(?SltllrtlS represented its it l;l'(?estructure in which each node is called a .SC'IIta'tttiC cat-egolw, or a (:atego'l~9 R)r siml)licity.
Edges in this struc-ture represent "is-a" relations am(rag the categories.For example, "Agents" and "P(!ople" (see Figure 1)are both categories.
Tile edge between these two (:at-egories indicates that any instance of "l)eoph~ '' is alsoan instance of "Agents".
The current version of ALT-.
l /E's Semlmtic llierarchy is :12 levels (let, I) and hasabout 3000 nodes.
The Semant ic  D ic t ionary  maps(~it(:h .\]~4pall('.sC IIOtlll to  its aI)prol)riate SeIt la l l t ic  cRt-cgories.
For example, the Selilalltic D!ctionary statesthat the noun )~!
:~ (niwatori), which meahs "chicken"OF "h011" ill English, is an instance of the categories"Meat" and "Birds".The Trans la t ion  Ru les  in AUI?-J/E associateJapanese patterns with English patterns.
Currently,ALT- J /E  uses roughly 10,000 of these rules.'
As Fig-ure 2 shows, each translation rule has a .\]apanese fret -tern its its left-hand side and all English pattern asits right-hand side.
For example, the first rule in thisfigure basically sltys that if the ,Japanese verb in asentence is ~J'~ < (yaku), its subj('(:t is an instance of"l)eople '', and its ol)ject is an instance of "lh'ead" or"Cake", then the following English pattern is to bellS(?d:Sub.jeer "l)ake" Obj(!ct.Note that in this (:~e the Japan(!se verb ~y~ ( (yaku)is transhtted into the English verb 'q)akc'".
This slune.\]aI)anes(!
yet'l) cait also be translated into the Englishverbs "roast", "broil", "crenmte" or "burn", depend-lug on the context.
These (:~Lses axe }landled by thefore" other rules given in Figure 2.Translation rules are meant only to handle basicsentences that contain just a single .\]itl)a.ltt.
'se v r}).Such sentences are called "simple selitellCeS.

of the problems fitting the design('rs of A1;I'-J/l~: is the refinement of the Smnantic lli(!rarchy.Whenever this structure is altered, the trans-lation rules mnst also t)e revised to r(qh*(:t thechange.

Anattractive approa(:h to this l)robhmi is lto resort toinductive machine learning techniques to extract thedesired translation rules fl'om examples of .laI)anescsent(m(:(~s and their English translations.

)The most important a(lvmltage of the al}ove ap-proach is that it cmt be applied to alnbiguous train-ing examl}les as they are, without the need to removethe mnbiguity explicitly as wc did with Ilaussler's al-gorithm.
Another adwmtage of using ID3 is that wedo not need to break our learning task into binaryclass learning problems ince ID3 is caI}ablc of Mu'n-ing multi-class learning concepts.6 Exper imenta l  WorkThe goad of tile experiments reI}orted here is to evalu-ate the qmdity of the partiad translation rules learnedby the two h.~m'ning methods we have just descril}ed.The comi}arison includes the folh}wing three settings:1.
Using llaussler's algorithm to learn fr{}ill trainingexaml}les ~ffter emoving the mnl)igulty.2.
Using ID3 to h;arn from training examl)les af-ter removing the ambiguity atnd performing thetransformation given in the Subsection 5.3.3.
Using ID3 to learn from tnfining examI}les afterperforming the transfi)rmation given ill tile Sub-section 5.3, trot without removing the.
ambiguity.In a sense, the first setting rellresents the lmst we cando in the absence of the ambiguity since llmlssler's al-goritl}m does at good job in exi)loiting the baekgT{mndknowledge fi-om the Selnanti{: Ilierarchy.
ComparingSetting 2 with Setting 1 tells us how successfifl ourtransformati{m of the training examl}les is in letting1D3 make use of the available I}ackground knowledge.Fimdly, comparing Setting 3 with Settir,g 2 tells nshow successful our transhn'mation is in letting 1133learn directly froin amt)igalous training examl)les.The experiments were done tbr six ditl'erent.lapanese ver/}s. '.\['able 1 shows a list of these verbs,along with the II/lltl})er of training eKaul i \ ] )h!s  l l sed ,  andthe a{:cura{:y levels obtained by each meth{}d. In thetable, "tlausslcr", "ID3 NA" and "11)3 A" de.noteSetting 1, Setting 2 and Setting 3, resl}e{:tively.
Thea(:curacy was esthnated using the leaLvt>olle-{}llt {:ross-wflidation meth{}d '| , m,d assuming that the rules {:{)m-I)osed rnamutlly by human experts are t}erfect (thatis, we are measuring how close tim learned rules areto those {:Omllosed mmmally).The i)erti}rmanee l vels of both lhmssler's alg()-rithm and ID3 when learning from unambiguous ex-amples are quite similar in Sl)ite of the fact that eachalgorithm implements a different bias and has a com-pletely diftin'ent way {}f' exl}loiting the backgroundknowledge.

In fact, for some of theverbs, the t}er for l I l~tn{:e is evelk \])etter when aml)iguityis present.
This suggests that the apl}roach we havechosen to de.al with ambiguity is effective for our task,and tl,at ext}licit retll{}vitl o\[ ambiguity is not an at-tractive strategy sim:e it is not easy to {t(}, and sinceit does not greatly improve the a(:{:m'aey anyway.The most important ll(}int here is that the ol}serveda{:cura{:y of both the.
11)3 a.lgorithm aim llaussler'salgorithm is satisfactorily high overa!.l in spite of thelimited mmfl}er of the training examl}k's used.
Sucha high level of at(:curat(:y str{mgly indicates that theuse of these algo,'ithms will provide significant aid inthe c{}l,struction of AI/.I'-J/E's trmMati{}\]t rules.7 Conc lus ionThis paper reported our work towaMs the acquisi-ti(m of,hqmnese-lCmglish translation rules through theuse of inductive machine learning techniques.
