UniversityCluj-Napoca, Romaniapalpar at gmail.comAbstractThere are relatively few entailment heuristicsthat exploit the directional nature of the entail-ment relation.
Cross-Lingual Text Entailment(CLTE), besides introducing the extra dimen-sion of cross-linguality, also requires to de-termine the exact direction of the entailmentrelation, to provide content synchronization(Negri et al, 2012).
Our system uses sim-ple dictionary lookup combined with heuris-tic conditions to determine the possible di-rections of entailment between the two textswritten in different languages.
The key mem-bers of the conditions were derived from (Cor-ley and Mihalcea, 2005) formula initially fortext similarity, while the entailment conditionused as a starting point was that from (Tataret al, 2009).
We show the results obtainedby our implementation of this simple and fastapproach at the CLTE task from the SemEval-2012 challenge.1 IntroductionRecognizing textual entailment (TE) is a key taskfor many natural language processing (NLP) prob-lems.
It consists in determining if an entailment re-lation exists between two texts: the text (T) and thehypothesis (H).
The notation T ?
H says that themeaning of H can be inferred from T, in order words,H does not introduce any novel information with re-spect to T.Even though RTE challenges lead to many ap-proaches for finding textual entailment, fewer au-thors exploited the directional character of the en-tailment relation.
Due to the fact that the entailmentrelation, unlike the equivalence relation, is not sym-metric, if T ?
H , it is less likely that the reverseH ?
T can also hold (Tatar et al, 2009).The novel Cross-Lingual Text Entailment (CLTE)approach increases the complexity of the traditionalTE task in two way, both of which have been onlypartially researched and have promise for great po-tential (Negri et al, 2012):?
the two texts are no longer written in the samelanguage (cross-linguality);?
the entailment needs to be queried in both di-rections (content synchronization).Mehdad et al (2010) presented initial research di-rections and experiments for the cross-lingual con-text and explored possible application scenarios.2 Theoretical BackgroundThe semantic similarity formula from (Corley andMihalcea, 2005) defines the similarity of a pair ofdocuments differently depending on with respect towhich text it is computed.
The formula involves onlythe set of open-class words (nouns, verbs, adjectivesand adverbs) from each text.Based on this text-to-text similarity metric, Tataret al (2009) have derived a textual entailment recog-nition system.
The paper demonstrated that in thecase when T ?
H holds, the following relation willtake place:sim(T,H)H > sim(T,H)T (1)however, the opposite of this statement is not alwaystrue, nevertheless it is likely.
In (Tatar et al, 2007)710a simpler version for the calculus of sim(T,H)T isused: namely the only case of similarity is the iden-tity (a symmetric relation) and/or the occurrence of aword from a text in the synset of a word in the othertext (not symmetric relation).Perini and Tatar (2009) used the earlier seman-tic similarity formula (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005)to derive a formula for directional text relatednessscore as follows:rel(T,H)T =?pos?Ti?WSTpos(maxRel(Ti)?
idf(Ti))?pos?Ti?WSTposidf(Ti)(2)A mathematically similar formula could be givenfor rel(T,H)H (by swapping T for H in the RHSof (2)) which would normally produce a differentscore.
In (2), maxRel(Ti) was defined as the high-est relatedness between (in this order) word Ti andwords from H having the same part of speech asTi.
The relatedness between a pair of words wascomputed by taking the weight of the highest-rankedWordNet relation that takes place between them.
Itshould be noted that the word order in the pair wasstrict and that most of the WordNet relations in-volved in the calculus were not symmetric.After defining the relatedness of two texts, whichdepends on the direction, Perini and Tatar (2009) in-troduced a new directional entailment condition, de-rived from the one in (Tatar et al, 2009):rel(T,H)T +?
> rel(T,H)H > rel(T,H)T > ?
.
(3)3 The DirRelCond3 SystemAfter having presented the necessary theoreticalbackground, in this section we give an overview ofour system for CLTE.The application was implemented in the Javaprogramming language.
XML input and outputwas performed using the DocumentBuilder and theDOM parser from Java.The first step was to tag both the English andthe foreign language sentence using the TreeTagger(Schmid, 1995), which had the advantage that it wasfast and it supported all the languages required bythis task by providing it with the necessary parame-ter file, and also had a nice Java wrapper for it (an-nolab, 2011).
The output of the tagger was used toobtain the necessary POS information needed to dis-tinguish the set of open-class words for each sen-tence.
Because the tagset used for each languagewas different, it was necessary to adapt all the differ-ent variants to the four generic classes: noun, verb,adjective and adverb.The translation step followed for the foreign lan-guage sentence, which took words only from theseclasses and translated them using two dictionariesin some cases.
The base dictionary used for wordlookup was the FreeDict (FreeDictProject, 2012),for which it was possible to download the languagefiles and use them locally with the help of a server(ktulu, 2006) and a Java client (SourceForge, 2001).The disadvantage of this dictionary was that it hadrather few headwords mainly for the Italian andSpanish languages.
A later improvement was touse an additional online dictionary as a fall-back,WordReference.com (WordReference.com, 2012),which had a very good headword count for the Ital-ian and French languages, it also provided a verynice JSON API to access it and there was a ready-to-use Java API (SourceForge, 2011) for it that sup-ported caching the results.
Although the number ofqueries per hour was limited, it was very helpful thatthey approved the caching of the results for the dura-tion of the development.
The dictionary lookup pro-cess attached to each foreign word that was foundthe set of English meanings, corresponding to eachsense that was found.The penultimate step was to compute the textrelatedness scores with respect to each sentence,rel(T,H)T and rel(T,H)H , by applying (2).
Theonly modification compared to the original formulawas that in the case of the translated word, all theobtained meanings were used and the one producingthe maximum relatedness was kept.
We have usedthe following weights (assigned intuitively) for thedifferent WordNet relations in the final word relat-edness score:?
equals: 1.0;?
same synset: 0.9;?
similar to: 0.85711?
hypernyms: 0.8;?
hyponyms: 0.7;?
entailment: 0.7;?
meronyms: 0.5;?
holonyms: 0.5;?
not in WordNet or dictionaries: 0.01.The final step was to devise a condition based onthese two text relatedness scores, similar to (3), butone that would be able to report the entailment votefor both directions:??????????
?noentail, if rel(T,H)T or rel(T,H)H < ?bidir, if abs(rel(T,H)T , rel(T,H)H) < ?forward, if rel(T,H)H > rel(T,H)T + ?backwd, otherwise(4)4 Experimental ResultsThe CLTE task provided researchers with trainingsets of 500 sentence pairs (one English, one foreign)already annotated with the type of entailment thatexists between them (?Forward?, ?Backward?, ?Bidi-rectional?, ?No entailment?).
There was one train-ing set for each French-English, German-English,Italian-English, Spanish-English language combina-tion (Negri et al, 2011).
The test set consisted in asimilarly structured 500 pairs for each language pairbut without annotations.
The mentioned entailmentjudgment types were uniformly distributed, both inthe case of the development and the test dataset.The DirRelCond3 system participated at theCLTE task with four runs for each of the above lan-guage combinations.
Regarding the results, the ac-curacies obtained are summarized in table 1 as per-centages.Figures 1, 2, 3, 4 show the precision, recall and F-measure for the ?Forward?, ?Backward?, ?No entail-ment?
and ?Bidirectional?

This is some-what expected because in this case it is more difficultto correctly judge since there could more possibilityfor error.Regarding the individual runs, run 2 addedslightly improved dictionary search in addition torun 1, by attempting to look for the lemma form ofthe word as well, that was available thanks to the712Figure 3: DirRelCond3 Italian-English pair precision, re-call and F-measure values for the different judgments.Figure 4: DirRelCond3 Spanish-English pair precision,recall and F-measure values of the different judgments.TreeTagger tool (Schmid, 1995).
In case the wordwas still not found, but the language was French orItalian and the word contained apostrophe, a lookupwas attempted for the part following it.Run 3 added another slight improvement for Ger-man, in case there was still no match for the word,tried to see if the word was a composite containingtwo parts found in the dictionary, and if so, used thefirst one.The first two runs were only using the FreeD-ict (FreeDictProject, 2012) dictionary, while start-ing with run 3, Italian and French language words,in case not found, could also be searched in the Wor-dReference (WordReference.com, 2012) online dic-tionary.The first three runs were using entailment condi-tions common to all language combinations.
Thevalues of the parameters were chosen based on theCLTE development dataset (Negri et al, 2011) andwere as follows:?
= 0.5, ?
= 0.03, ?
= 0.0.The final run used empirically-tuned conditions foreach language pair in the dataset.
The ?
thresholdneeded to be lowered for Spanish since many wordswere not found in FreeDict, which was the only onewe had available for use, so the relatedness scoreswere rather smaller.

The system was agood example of how an approach for mono-lingualtext entailment can be adapted to the new dimen-sion of cross-linguality.
It would have been possibleto use a MT tool and then do the entailment detec-tion steps all in English as was the original approach,however we expected that that would introduce morepossibility for error than translating and comparingwords with the same POS.The overall best result for each language that wehave obtained was around the median of all the sys-tem runs that were submitted to the CLTE task.
Thebest accuracy obtained by our system was for theFrench-English pair with 38.4%, but well below theaccuracy of the best systems.
Generally the resultsinvolving German and French were somewhat betterthan the other two languages.
In the case of Span-ish this could easily be caused by the significantlysmaller dictionary that was available, while for Ital-ian, after relying also on WordReference.com thiswas no longer the case.
A possiblity is that some lan-guage particularities were affecting the results (e.g.high usage of apostrophe) but perhaps the entailmentheuristic thresholds were not the best either.Finally, there are several possible improvements.713Firstly, in case the dictionary provides POS infor-mation for the translation, that could be used to re-tain only those senses that have the same POS asthe original word.
For some languages, particularlyfor Spanish, it would be helpful to rely on dictio-naries with more headwords.
Secondly, we can usethe inverse document frequency counts for words,obtained either from the CLTE development cor-pus or from web searches, because currently thatwas simply one.
Thirdly, both the empirically ob-tained conditions can be further tuned, manually orby means of learning, separately for each languagepair.
Fourthly, when computing the word relatednessscores, the weights of the WordNet relations couldbe further adjusted for each language, empirically,or again by learning.Referencesannolab.
