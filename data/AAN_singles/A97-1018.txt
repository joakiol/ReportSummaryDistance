ChinaIkc-dcs@mail.tsinghua.edu.cnAbstractChinese word segmentation a d POS tagging aretwo key techniques in many applications inChinese information processing.
Great effortshave been paid to the research in the last decade,but unfortunately, no practical system with highperformance for unrestricted texts is available upto date.
CSeg&Tagl.0, a Chinese wordsegmenter and POS tagger which unifies thesetwo procedures into one model, is introduced inthis paper.
The preliminary open tests show thatthe segmentation precision of CSeg&Tagl.0 isabout 98.0% - 99.3%, POS tagging precisionabout 91.0% 97.1%, and the recall andprecision for unknown words are ranging from95.0% to 99.0% and from 87.6% to 95.3%respectively.
The processing speed is about 100characters per second on Pentium 133 PC.
Thework of improving the performance ofthe systemis still ongoing.1.
Background and the Related IssuesIn Chinese, there do not exist delimiters, such asspacing in English, to explicitly indicate boundariesbetween words.
Chinese word segmentation istherefore proposed as the first step in any Chineseinformation processing systems.
Then we still face theproblem of part-of-speech tagging.
These two issueshave been intensively studied by the Chinese languagecomputing community in the last decade\[l-18\].Unfortunately however, no word segmenter and POStagger for Chinese with satisfactory performance intreating unrestricted texts are available so far.Two main obstacles block the progress of Chineseword segmentation: one is ambiguRy, another isunknown word.
The sentences in (I) are examples ofambiguity and the sentence (2) and (3) examples ofunknown word.
(la) ~-@~:9~P~:~\ [~.
(lb) ~_~, ~ P)i:~ ~ ~ f.-J ~,~t~ ~ ~,,.At least two explanations are possible for thefragment "(O~,P~" in (1), resulting in two differentsegmentations:correct segmentation for (1 a)this CLASSIFIER institute very famous(This institute is very famous.

For instance, ininformation retrieval, the incorrect segmentation for thefragment "/~:~P)i:" in (la) and (lb) will definitelycause improper access to the texts involving it.
Anothertypical application is in text-to-speech onversion.
Theover-segmentation f TFN1 and TFN2 in thesentence (2) will result in the synthesized speecheschoppy.
The CN in (3) may make the wordsegmentation a d POS tagging of the whole sentencetotally wrong, and further, the pronunciation of thecharacter -~ totally wrong (~- should be pronouncedas shah4 if it is referred to a surname, whereas as danlif adjective or adverb).2.
The Complexity of the TaskCombinatorial Explosion 1: Word SegmentationCandidate SpaceThe number of possible segmentations for somesentences may be rather large.
Observe:(4) ,~ 1~ r~ I~l ~ I~ ~4~4 ...totally 76 possible segmentations will be found if wesimply match the sentence with a dictionary:(segl) ,~l~?

I \[\] I ~ I ~J I ~ I~ I St I ~74 I ,..Fig.l shows the word segmentation candidatespace for the sentence (4).The situation will be even complicated asunknown words is under consideration(Fig.2).Generally, segmentation ambiguities can beclassified into three categories:(a) ambiguities among common words(refer to allarcs in Fig.
1)(b) ambiguities among unknown words(see arcsof representing candidates for Chinese place name andfor Chinese personal names in Fig.2)(c) ambiguities among common words andunknown words(see arcs across Chinese personal namecandidates "~Y_:~", "Jt~k~I:~", :E~$~I~" and the arcacross common word ":~"(Iove, like) in Fig.2)In our experience, ambiguities of type (a) willcause about 3% loss on the precision rate ofsegmentation i  the condition of making use ofmaximal matching strategy, one of the most popularmethods employed in word segmentation systems, andtype (b) and (c) about 10.0% loss if the processing ofunknown words is ignored (unfortunately, type (b)and (c) have received less attention than type (a) in theliterature).2 0 3 \ [ \ ]  s 8 ', N 9 io.

Scholars ever tried to do so.The method reported in \[1 I\] is: (a) finding out the N-best segmentation candidates explicitly in terms ofword frequency and length; (b) POS tagging each ofthe N-best segmentation candidates, resulting in the N-best tag sequences accordingly; and (c) using a scorewith weighted contributions from (a) and (b) to selectthe best solution.
Note that the model used in (a) is justword unigram, and (a) and (b) are being donesuccessively (denoted as "(a)+(b)").
It is a kind ofpseudo-integration.
More truly one, in our point ofview, should be: (a) taking all segmentationpossibilities into account; (b) expanding everysegmentation candidate of the input sentence into anumber of tag sequences one by one, deriving aconsiderable huge segmentation a d tagging candidatespace; and (c) seeking the optimal path over such spacewith a bigram model, obtaining then both wordsegmentation and POS tagging result from the path121found.
In the case, (a) and (b) are being donesimultaneously (denoted by "(a)ll(b)").
We regard thisas a basic strategy and testbed for conducting oursystem.
Obviously, a much more serious combinatorialproblem is encountered here.3.
CSeg&Tagl.0: System Architecture andAlgorithm DesignAlthough great efforts have been paid to therelated researches by Chinese information processingcommunity in the last decade, we still have not apractical word segmenter and POS tagger at hand yet.What is the problem?
The crucial reason, we believe,lies in the "knowledge".
As indicated in section 2, wemeet a very serious difficulty, without relevantknowledge, even humanbeings will definitely fail tosolve it.
The focus of the research should be no longersolely on the 'pure' or 'new' formal algorithms --  nomatter what it will be, instead, what is urgentlyrequired is on two issues, i.e., (1) what sorts of andhow many knowledges are needed; and (2) how thesevarious konwledges can be represented, extracted, andcooperatively mastered, in a system.This is also the philosophy in designingCseg&Tagl.0, an integrated system for Chinese wordsegmentation and POS tagging, which is beingdeveloped at the National Key Lab.
of IntelligentTechnology and Systems, Tsinghua University.
Theaim of CSeg&Tag is to be able to process unrestrictedrunning texts.
Fig.4 gives its architecture.Roughly speaking, Cseg&Tagl.0 can be viewedas a three-level multi-agent(the concept of "agent"means an entity that can make decision independentlyand communicate with others) system plus some othernecessary mechanisms.
They are: (1) agents at the lowlevel for treating unknown words; (2) a competitionagent at the intermediate l vel for resolving conflictsamong low level agents; (3) a bigram-based agent atthe high level for coping with all the remainingambiguities; (4) mechanisms employing the so-called"global statistics" and "local statistics" (cache); and (5)a rule base.
We will introduce them briefly in turn(thedetailed iscussion of each part is beyond the scope ofthis paper).3.1.
Agents  at  the Low Leve l  fo r  TreatingUnknown WordsThe types of unknown words CSeg&Tagl.0currently concerns include Chinese personalnames( CN), transliterated foreign personal names( TFN)and Chinese place names(CPN).
They can not beenumerated in any dictionary even with numerous size.To study unknown words systematically, we buildup there relevant banks:?
CN Bank(CNB): 200,000 samples?
TFN Bank(TFNB): 38,769 samplesCPN Bank(CPNB): 17,637 samplesThe difficulty of identifying unknown words inChinese arises from characteristics of them:(a) no any explicit hint such as capitalization inEnglish exists to signal the presence of unknown words,and the character sets used for unknown words are strictsubsets of Chinese characters(the size of the completeChinese character set is 6763), with some degree ofdecentralized distributions;CN (surname)CN (given name)TFN# of chars in char set7293345501CPN 2595(b) the length of unknown words may varyarbitrarily;(c) some characters used in unknown words mayalso be used as mono-syllabic common words in texts;(d) the mono-syllabic words identified above fallinto the syntactic ategories not only notional words butalso function words;(e) the character sets are mutually intersected tosome extent;(f) some multi-syllabic words may occur inunknown words.In our system, three agents, CNAgent, TFNAgentand CPNAgent are set up to be responsible for findingcandidates in input texts accordingly.
A candidate canbe regarded as a "guess" with a value of belief.
Threesteps are involved in all the three agents in general:Step 1: Applying MM(maximal matching)first asa pre-processing, then finding candidates over tileresulting fragments of charactersThere are two strategies for seeking candidates inthe input sentence.
One is simply viewing it as characterstring, finding candidates over whole of it in terms ofthe relevant character set:122Input Text ,- : -9  SentToBeSeg C~__.

Another way is viewing input asword string, applying MM segmentation as a pre-processing first, then trying to find candidates only overthe fragments composed of successive single characters:(5b) 2E I N I ~: I ~- I ?

(ii) structural information# nature of charactersabsolute closure characters for CNsThey will definitely belong to a Chinese surnameonce falling into the control domain of it:?
relative closure characters for CNsIn certain conditions, they function as absoluteclosure characters:(7a) i~ \ [ t  I t~  I ~,~)~CNI very clever(CN1 is very clever)(7b) i~  I~t~ \ [~, )kCN2 clever very(CN2 is very clever)?
open characters for CNsFor this sort of characters, possibilities of beingincluded in a name and excluded out of the name mustbe reserved:CNI read novel(CNI is reading a novel)CN2 like read novel(CN2 likes to read novels)# position in unknown wordsFor instance, "~"  always occurs in the firstposition of given name of CNs, illustrated as "~:~l~E~" .
The CN candidate "~r~'?"

The Competition Agent at theIntermediate Level for Resolving Conflictsamong Low Level AgentsThe candidates given independently by threeagents may contradict each other on some occasions(see Fig.2).
We observe from 497 randomly selectedsentences that low level agents generate multiple(>=2)unknown word candidates in 17.7% of them(Fig.5), and,the probability of conflicting is about 88% if candidatenumber is 2 and 100% if it is greater than 2(Fig.6).A competition agent is established to deal withsuch conflicts.
The evaluation is based on allinformation from various resources, that is:No.

The  B igram-based  Agent at the HighLeve l  for Coping with  all  the  Remain ingAmbiguit iesThe conventional POS bigram model and adynamic programming algorithm are used in this highlevel agent.
The searching space of the algorithm is thecomplete combination of all possible word and tagsequences, and the complexity of it can be theoreticallyand experimentally proved still polynomial.3.4.
Global Statistics & Local StatisticsGlobal statistics are referred to statistical dataderived from very large corpora, as mutual informationand t-test in Cseg&Tagl.0, whereas local statistics tothose derived from the article in which the inputsentence stands -- like a chche.
Both of them takecharacters as basic unit of computation, because anyChinese word is exactly a combination of characters inone way or another.
Experiments by us reveal thatthey(especially the latter) are quite important in theresolution of ambiguities and unknown words.
Referback to "~,"  and " ~ "  in (Sa) and (8b) as anexample.
The both CN candidates are reasonable giventhe isolated sentence only, but by cache, it is in fact acollection of ambiguous entities unsolved so far in thecurrent input article, the algorithm will have moreevidence to make decision.
We will discuss this indepth in another paper.3.5.
Ru le  BaseIt contains knowledge in rule form, includingalmost all word formation rules in Chinese, a numberof simple but very reliable syntactic rules, and someheuristic rules.4.
Exper imenta l  Resu l tsCseg&Tagl.0 is implemented in Windowsenvironment with Visual C++I.0 programminglanguage.
The dictionary supporting it contains 60,133word entries along with word frequencies, parts ofspeech, and various types of information ecessary forthe purpose of segmentation and tagging.
The size ofmanually tagged corpus for training the bigram modelis about 0.4 M words, and that of the raw corpus forachieving lobal statistics is 20M characters.We define:# words- correctly- segmented Seg.
precision=-# words- in - input- texts# words- correctly- tagged Tag.
precision=-# words- in - input- textsThe preliminary open tests show that forCSeg&Tagl.0, the word segmentation precision isranging from 98.0% to 99.3%, POS tagging precisionfrom 91.0 to 97.1%, and the recall and precision forunknown words are from 95.0% to 99.0% and from87.6% to 95.3% respectively.
The speed is about 100characters per second on Pentium 133.
A runningsample of Cseg&Tagl.0 is demonstrated asfollows(tokens underlined in the output are unknownwords successfully identified while those in bold arewords wrongly tagged):\[input text\]~ L ~ ?

To getour goal, i.e., developing a system with approximately99% segmentation precision and 95% tagging precisionfor any running Chinese texts in any cases, quite a lotof work is still waiting there to be done.
What we cansay now is that we believe it is possible to reach thisdestination in a not very far future, and we knowmore than before about how to approach it.
The secondround work is ongoing currently, with emphasis on twoaspects: (1) to promote the algorithm, particularly thoseassociated with agents and cache, carefully; (2) toimprove the quality of knowledge base by bothenlarging the size of the relevant resources(textualcorpora, unknown word banks, etc.)
and refining thelexicon, tagged corpus and the rule base.AcknowledgmentThis research is supported by the National NaturalScience Foundation of China and by the Youth ScienceFoundation of Tsinghua University, Beijing,P.R.China.References\[1\] N.Y.
