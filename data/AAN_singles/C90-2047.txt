Centering theory and the Italian pronominal systemBarbara  Di Eugenio*Depar tment  of Computer  and Informat ion ScienceUniversity of PennsylvaniaPhi ladelphia,  PAdieugeni@linc.cis.upenn.eduAbst rac tIn this paper, I give an account, in terms of cen-tering theory \[GJW86\], of some phenomena ofpronominalization i Italian, in particular theuse of the null or the overt pronoun in subjectposition.
After a general introduction to theItalian pronominal system, I will review center-ing, and then show how the original rules givenin \[GJW86\] have to be extended or modified.Finally, I will show that centering does not ac-count for two phenomena: first, the functionalrole of an utterance may override the predictionsof centering; second, a null subject can be usedto refer to a whole discourse segment.
This lat-ter phenomenon should ideally be explained inthe same terms that the other phenomena in-volving null subject are.1 The  I ta l ian pronomina l  sys-temIn Italian, there are two pronominM systems,characterized by a different syntactic distribu-tion: weak pronouns, that must always be cliff-cized to the verb (e.g.
\]a, \]o, li, le - respectivelyher, accusative; him, accusative; them, mascu-line, accusative; them, feminine, accusative orher, dative), and strong pronouns (lui, lei, Ioro -respectively he or him; she or her; they or them).The null subject can be considered as belongingto the system of weak pronouns.
Notice that inItalian there is no neuter gender: nouns referringto inanimate objects are masculine or feminine.The weak pronouns used in this case are those ofthe corresponding gender, while, when a strongpronoun has to be used, paraphrase or deictics*This research was supported by DARPA grant no.N0014-85--K0018.are preferred.
A strong pronoun for inanimateobjects does exist - esso for masculine, essa forfeminine, but it is not much used in current Ital-ian.Weak and strong pronouns are often in com-plementary distribution, as the following exam-ple shows - the contrast is between the use ofthe null or overt pronoun in subject position 1:Ex.
1 a)b)Quando Car lo /  ha incontrato Mar io j ,When Car lo /  has met Marioj,Oi/.j non gli.i/j ha nemmeno detto "ciao".he / / , /  not to -h im/ / , )  has even said "hi".Quando Car lo i  ha incontrato Mar io / ,When Car lo /  has met Mar io j ,lu i .
i / j  non g l i i / , j  ha nemmeno detto "ci~to'.he .
i / i  not to -h imq.
3 has even said "hi".Notice the difference between sentences a andb: in a the null pronoun in subject position refersto Carlo and therefore gli has to refer to Mario;in b reference is switched.
The overt pronounlui in subject position requires its referent o beMario, and therefore gli has to refer to Carlo.There are some syntactic accounts of coref-erence phenomena in Italian, for example Cal-abrese's \[Cal86\].
He starts from the observationthat weak pronouns are used in all those con-texts in which there is an expected referent forthe pronoun itself; he claims that we cannot usestrong pronouns in place of weak ones, and vice2 versa1?
indicates a null subject and can be translated asan unstressed pronoun in English.
In all the examples Iwill be using, if a proper name ends in -o or -i, it hasa male referent; if it ends in -a, a female referent.
Thetranslations I provide are literal and generally word byword.2Actually Calabrese classifies pronouns as unstressed/ stressed, and not as weak / strong, but I think his ter-minology may lead the reader to a wrong conclusion.In fact, while the "unstressed" pronouns can never bestressed, the "stressed" pronouns can, but not necessar-ily ~re.270 1To formalize the concept of expected referent,:he resorts to the notion of Thema, defined asthe subject of a primary predication, where x isa primary predicate of y iff x and y form a con-stituent which is either O-marked or \[+ INFL\].tie then says that a pronoun in position of' rhema is expected to have another Thema asantecedent, and that if this coindexing occurs,the pronoun must be a weak one.Through these definitions and rules he man-ages to account for a wide range of data, as faras single sentences are concerned, but when hetries to extend them to discourse, their useful-hess and predictive power is not sufficient, and,~ometimes they give the wrong prediction.
Thisis partly due to his very simplistic view of dis-course, which he considers as a conjunction ofsentences.
Even for those sentences in whichthis view is sufficient, the argument hat coref-erence depends only on the syntactic structureof the discourse and that we cannot use a weakpronoun when the theory predicts that a strongone is expected oes not hold.
Consider the fol-lowing example:Ex.
2 D1) a)b)De) a)b)Ieri Carloi ha incontrato Mario j .Yesterday Carloi has met Marioj .
?,/,j Non gli,i/j ha nemmeno detto "ciao".Hei not to-h imj  has even said "hi".Ieri Carloi ha incontrato Mariaj .Yesterday Carloi has met Mariaj .
?,ilj Non gl| i/ , j  ha nemmeno detto "ciao".Shej not to-himi has even said "hi".Calabrese's analysis correctly explains the al-lowed and disallowed coreferences in DI: Mariois not the Thema of Dl.a.
So, if we want tohave the subject of Dl .b refer to Mario, we can-.aot use a weak pronoun, but we have to use a~trong one: in fact, if we do use a null subject,it is interpreted as referring to Carlo.Let's now consider D2.
The structure of theI;wo discourses is exactly the same.
ThereforeI;he theory predicts that, if we want to refer toMaria, which is not the Thema of D2.a, we havet;o use a strong pronoun, and not a null one: in-~:vtead, D2,b is almost perfect.The reason is that in D2.b the null subject hastwo potential referents, one male and the other:lbmale.
While processing the sentence, the pos-,ibility that the null subject refers to Carlo isculed out when the clitic gli, marked for mascu-line, is found.
In fact, gli has to refer to Carlo;given that gli is not reflexive, it cannot coreferwith the subject, therefore the latter is forced torefer to Maria.This kind of disambiguation cannot be per-formed in Dl.b,  in which the null subject hastwo potential referents of the same gender.I should mention that Calabrese, at the begin-ning of his paper, says that such features \[gen-der, number and person\] allow a first selectionamong the possible refe~ents which are assignedto the pronominal.
Presumably he would usethese features as a superimposed filter to be ap-plied to the whole sentence after it ha~s beencompletely read or heard.Itowever, this could hardly fit in a model ofhow people process discourse: it is very likelythat the normal human mode of operation is in-cremental \[Ste89\].
My claim is that disambigua-tion clues have to be taken into account as soonas they are available while processing a sentence.We will see in fact that they can help to makea discourse coherent or not according to theirposition in the sentence.Notice that the issue here is to account notso much for the grammatieality or ungrammat-icality of a sentence, as pure syntactic accountsdo, but for more or less coherence in a discourse:this is exactly the purpose of centering theory.in particular, centering relates discourse coher-ence with the inference load that a certain se-quence of utterances, and especially a certainchoice of referring expressions, requires on thepart of the hearer.In the next section, I'll show how centeringtheory can be useful to explain certain uses ofItalian pronouns in discourse, and in turn, howa richer pronominal system caz~ help to refinethe rules that centering uses.2 Centering theoryIt is now widely accepted that discourse is di-vided into segments (see for example \[Web88\]);a discourse is coherent when its constituent seg-ments exhibit both local coherence - namely, co-herence among the utterances of each individualsegment, and global coherence - namely, coher-ence among the different segments.Centering is an account of local coherence: ittries to determine the entity which an utterancemost centrally concerns.
Besides, it assesses the271coherence Of a discourse in terms of the differentmoves that a speaker can do (basically, going onto talk about the same entity or switching toanother one), and in terms of how these movesare encoded, in particular as far as the choiceof referring expressions i concerned.
Accordingto \[GJW86\], discourse coherence is a measure ofthe infhrence load a certain discourse imposes ona hearer.
Notice that the view I am taking oncentering is as a theory of discourse production.From \[GJW86\], it is not very clear whether cen-tering concerns the production or the compre-hension of discourse.More technically, there are three moves thata speaker can perform, for every triple of ut-terances U~, Un+I, Un+2, belonging to the samesegment:DEF .
!Cont inuat ion :  Un and gn+l  concern  the sameentity; it is likely that Un+2 will concernit too.Retent ion :  Un and Un+x concern the same emtity, but it is not likely that U,~+2 will con-cern it.Shi f t ing:  U,~ and U~+I concern different enti-ties.To formalize these concepts, the theory de-fines ~ centers those entities that serve to linkone utterance to another in the same segment;an utterance U~ typically has a single backwardlooking center X (Cb), and a set of forward look-ing centers (Of's) {}~, ...,\]~m}.X, YI~ ..., Ym are all candidates for beingCb(U,~+I) (in fact X = ~,  for some i), andCb(U,,+I) will be constrained to belong to theset of Cf's of U~.
Both Cb(U~) and the setof Cf's(Un) correspond to linguisticaJ\]y realizedNPs in Un.The set of Cf's for a given utterance Un is par-tially ordered; the ordering relation is affectedby syntactic factors.
In \[GJW86\], the only syn-tactic element that is identified in this respectis the subject of U~: it is the most likely en-tity to be Cb(Un+l), therefore it is the highestranked Cf in U~.
This assumption is definitelyplausible, but it does not say anything aboutordering among the other Cf's.
For a more de-tailed analysis of the factors affecting Cf's order-ing, see Kameyama' s application of centering toJapanese \[Kam85\], and for more recent work onthis topic, \[WIC90\].
I will not address this prob-lem in the current paper.Given that the Cb corresponds to the en-tity that an utterance concerns, the speaker hassome choices as far as encoding the Cb goes.
In\[GJW86\] the following rule R1 is proposed:in Un+l the speaker can use?
a single pronoun, and that is the Cb(Un+l);?
zero or more than one pronoun: thenCb(U~+,)  is- Cb(U~) if Cb(Un) is realized in U~+~,-o therw ise  the highest ranked Cf(Un)which is realized in U,~+I.In order to ensure a coherent discourse, thespeaker has to apply the following rule R2 aswell:Given Cb(U~) = X, Cf(U~) = {Y~ > ... > Y,~},X = Yk, for some k, 1 < k < m:if there are pairs {Y i ,Y j} ,  with i < j ,  s.t.
both Yiand Yj are realized in Un+l, and if \]Q is realizedwith a pronoun, then Y, has to be realized with apronoun.The previous rule requires that a speaker, ifs/he chooses to use a pronoun to refer to a cer-tain Cf Yj, has to use a pronoun to refer to allthe other Cfs realized in the current utteranceand higher in the ordering than ~.This rule accounts for the unacceptabil ity ofdiscourses like (from \[GJW86\]) 3:Ex.
3 U1) Johni wanted to go for a ride ye,~terday.c~(yl) : {John}Us) Hei called up Mike 3.Cb(U~) = Joh~C:f(U~) = {John > Mike}U3) Hej  was annoyed by John i ' s  call .In U3, Mike is referred to with a pronoun; Mikewas less highly ranked than John as a Cf, there-fore, if we want to refer to John in//3, we shouldalso use a pronoun.
The fact that in Ua theproper name John is used makes the sequenceunacceptable: in fact substituting his to John'sresults in an acceptable discourse.3Notice that the first utterance of a discourse does nothave a Cb.272 3After recognizing what Cb(U~+I) is, thehearer can derive the kind of move that thespeaker has performed in the following way:DEF.
ECont inuat ion :  Cb(Un+l) = Cb(Un) andCb(U~+I) is the most highly ranked ele-ment in Cf(U,~+I).I te tent ion :  Cb(U,~+I) = Cb(Un) but Cb(U~+,)is not the most highly ranked element inCf(U~+~).Shif t ing:  Cb(Un+l) ?
Cb(U,~) 4Notice the correspondence between Def.
1and Def.
1': the notion of Un and Un+l con-cerning the same entity corresponds to Un andUn+l having the same Cb.
The notion of Un+2going on to concern still the same entity cor-responds to Cb(U=+I) being the most highlyranked Cf(Un+l).3 Center ing and Ital ian pro-nounsI now want to recast the choices that the twoItalian pronominal systems offer to a speaker interms of centering, and, at the same time, refinecentering itself.
I will get evidence from exam-ples like the following 5.Ex.
4 U~) Maria/ voleva andare al mare.Mariai wanted to go to the seaside.U~) ~bl Telefono' a Giovannij.Shei called Giovannij up.U3) a) ?i Si arrabbio' perche' ?i non Iojt rovo  ~ a CKSa.Shei got angry because shei not h|mjfind at home.b) 4'i/:j Si arrabbio'perche' Cj stava dormendo.Shei /?Hej  got angrybecause he/ was sleeping.c) Luij si arrabbio' perche' ~bj stava dormendo.Hej got angry because hej was sleeping.d) Cj Sie' arrabbiatOperche' Cj stava dormendo.4Other versions of centering provide for two differenttypes o:f shifting \[BFP87\].5I am using referents of different gender, becauseI want to show how gender and morphological mark-ings come into play when resolving reference.
Noticethat these examples would not be ambiguous in English,given that null subject is not an option available to aspeaker: the subject he/she would unambiguously pickup its referent.Hej has gotten angry(-masc.
)because h% was sleeping.Various interesting facts come out from thefour U3 variations 6.\[a\] The null subject refers to Maria, who, ac-cording to the rules in the previous ection,is Cb(U3.a), and the highest ranked ele-ment in Cf(U3.a).
U3.a thus demonstratescenter continuation.
The discourse is per-fectly coherent.\[b\] The most natural interpretation is that thenull subject in the main clause refers toMaria - the null subject in the subordi-nate clause is forced to refer to Giovannion pragmatic grounds.However, for this same pragmatic reason,on second thought the null subject in themMn clause may be interpreted as refer-ring to Giovanni, but the discourse soundsless coherent.\[el The speaker perfonas a felicitous centershifting by referring to Giovanni with anovert pronoun, given that Giovanni was notCb(U2), and not even the highest Cf(U2).\[d\] Contrast this utterance with \[b\].
Theyshould have the same effect on the hearer,namely, the null subject should be inter-preted as referring to Maria: instead in\[d\] it is felicitously interpreted as referringto Giovanni.
This happens because in \[d\]the verb is in the present perfect tense 7;the past participle agrees with the subject,and its masculine morphology forces thereferent of the null subject to be Giovanni,and not Maria.It seems to me that Ex.4 and other similarexamples point to the following generalizations:?
typically, the speaker encodes center con-tinuation with a null subject.
This agreeswith Kameyama's analysis of Japanese\[Kam85\]);~As a warning to the reader, notice that I am notworrying about the interpretation of the null snbject inthe subordinate causal clause, as it does not affect theinterpretation ofthe null subject in the main clause, andit is affected by pragmatic reasons.TThe temporal relation between the preceding dis-course and \[d\] is not right; U2 should also be in the pastperfect.
However, this temporal incoherence does not af-fect resolution of pronoun reference.4 273?
he typically encodes center retention orshift with a stressed pronoun;?
he can felicitously use a null subject incases of center etention or shift if he pro-vides Un+l with syntactic features thatforce the null subject to refer to a partic-ular referent and not to Cb(U,~).My claim is that it is the syntactic contextup to and including the verbal form(s) carryingtense and / or agreement that makes the ref-erence felicitous or not.
Consider U3.d again:it is the fact that the main verb is marked formasculine that allows the null subject to referto something different from Cb(U2).Analogous considerations hold for D2.b in Ex.2.
There the clitic g\]i precedes the verb andforces the null subject to refer to Maria.
Thefact that the clitic precedes the verb is crucial:evidence for this derives from examples involv-ing modal verbs and clitics.Ex.
5 u,)u~)Mariai  e' arrabbiata con Giorgio, :Mariai  is angry with Giorgloj :a) ?i non vuole piu' parlarglij.shei not wants any more talk-to-himj.b) * Cj non vuole piu' parlarlei.?
hej not wants any more tMk-to-heri.c) Cj non lei vuole piu' parlare.hej not to-heri  wants any more talk.Here U2.a is perfect, with the null subject re-ferring to the higher Cf(U1), namely Maria.U2.b is incoherent: the null subject is inter-preted as :referring to Maria, but when the cliticle is found, at the end of the sentence, the heareris forced to change interpretation.
The effect issimilar to a syntactic "garden path".U2.c is acceptable, for the very reason that theclitic le, that in U2.b is cliticized onto parlare,climbs in front of the modal verb vuo\[e: so thehearer is forced to exclude Maria as referent ofthe null subject.
This happens early enough sothat no "garden path" effect is registered.4 Other phenomenaThe predictions presented in the previous sec-tion are quite reliable, but there are some casesthat are not taken into account.4.1 Purpose  of  an  u t te ranceConsider the following example:Ex.
6 U~) Luisai ha lasciato suo mar i to j :Luisai has left her  husbandj .U~) ?.i/~ picchiava i bambini e si ubriacava.hej used to beat the childrenand get drunk.In this case, Cb(U2) is Luisa's husband.
U2 is fe-licitous, although the speaker uses a null subjectto achieve a shift and no syntactic lue forces thenull subject not to refer to Luisa.
It looks likeit is the function of U2, namely, explaining whyLuisa left her husband, that licenses the use ofa null subject in this case.It may even be argued that this case is out-side the purview of centering, which explicitlystates that the referential phenomena accountedfor are within a single segment: U2 may belongto a new segment, possibly much longer thanwhat is shown here, that explMns why Luisa lefther husband.On the other hand, it seems to me that theconcept of local coherence is not totally depen-dent on having two utterances belonging to thesame segment.
The transition to another seg-ment may override centering predictions; never-theless, the referential expressions found in thefirst utterance of the new segment may need tobe accounted for in terms of the Cf's of the lastutterance of the previous egment.
This may bewhat happens in Ex.6, if indeed U2 belongs to anew segment.4.2 Nu l l  sub jec t  re fe r r ing  to  a who led i scourse  segmentReference to a whole discourse segment is gen-erally achieved in Italian by means of questo /cio', both equivalent o this, but sometimes anull subject is used (on this topic, see \[DiE89\]):Ex.

Integrating theanalysis of these phenomena with centering willshed some light on the whole phenomenon ofreference.Centering ives us a vintage point of view inlooking at local coherence in discourse as em-bodied by the choice of referring expressionsthat a speaker uses.
Languages with richer mor-phological marking and agreement system thanEnglish can be very useful both to assess center-ing and to refine its rules.Acknowledgements .I would like to thank Prof. Bonnie Webber forher support and her comments on earlier ver-sions of this paper, and Prof. Aravind aoshi foruseful discussions.References\[I FP87\]\[ca86\]\[DIE89\]\[taws6\]\[Kam85\]\[Ste89\]\[Web88\]\[wic90\]Susan Brennan, Marilyn WalkerFriedman, and Carl Pollard.
