In this paper we describe CRAB ?
the first publicly available tool forsupporting the risk assessment workflow.
CRAB, currently at version 2.0, facilitates the gatheringof relevant literature via PubMed queries as well as semantic classification, statistical analysis andefficient study of the literature.
The tool is freely available as an in-browser application.1 IntroductionBiomedical text mining addresses the great need to access information in the growing body of literaturein biomedical sciences.
Prior research has produced useful tools for supporting practical tasks such asliterature curation and development of semantic databases, among others (Chapman and Cohen, 2009;Harmston et al., 2010; Simpson and Demner-Fushman, 2012; McDonald and Kelly, 2012).
In this paperwe describe a tool we have built to aid literature exploration for the task of chemical risk assessment(CRA).
The need for assessment of chemical hazards, exposures and their corresponding health risks isgrowing, as many countries have tightened up their chemical safety rules.
CRA work requires thoroughreview of available scientific data for each chemical under inspection, much of which can be found inscientific literature (EPA, 2005).
Since the scientific data is highly varied and well-studied chemicalsmay have tens of thousands of publications (e.g.
to date PubMed contains 23,665 articles mentioningphenobarbital), the task can be extremely time consuming when conducted via conventional means(Korhonen et al., 2009).
As a result, there is interest among the CRA community in text mining tools thatcan aid and streamline the literature review process.We have developed CRAB, an online system that supports the entire process of literature review forcancer risk assessors.
It is the first and only NLP system that serves this need.
CRAB contains three maincomponents:1.
Literature search with PubMed integration2.
Semantic classification of abstracts with summary visualisation3.
Literature browsing with markup of information structureThese components are described further in Section 2 below.
Version 2.0 of CRAB is freely available as anin-browser application; see Section 4 for access information.2 System description2.1 Literature searchThe first step for the user is to retrieve a collection of scientific articles relevant to their need, e.g., allarticles with abstracts that contain the name of a given chemical.
The CRAB 2.0 search page (Figure1) allows the user to directly query the MEDLINE database of biomedical abstracts.

These concepts are organised hierarchically in two main taxonomies: (1) kinds ofscientific evidence used for CRA (e.g., human studies, animal studies, cell experiments, biochemical/cellbiological effects); (2) the carcinogenic modes of action indicated by the evidence (e.g., genotoxic,nongenotoxic/indirect genotoxic, cell death, inflammation, angiogenesis).
The underlying classifier is asupport vector machine (SVM) trained on a dataset of 3,078 manually annotated abstracts.
Features usedby the SVM include lexical n-grams, character n-grams and MeSH concepts.
For more details on theconcept taxonomies, training corpus and classifier see Korhonen et al.
(2012).1http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/77Figure 3: The CRAB 2.0 information structure componentOnce each abstract in the retrieved collection has been classified, the user is presented with a summaryof counts for each concept (Figure 2a).
In a user study, risk assessors found this summary very useful forobtaining a broad overview of the literature, identifying groups of chemicals with similar toxicologicalprofiles and identifying data gaps (Korhonen et al., 2012).
The user can also request a histogramvisualisation (Figure 2b), which is produced through a call to the statistical software R.22.3 Literature browsingThe risk assessment workflow involves close reading of relevant abstracts to identify specific informationabout methods, experimental details, results and conclusions.
While it is not feasible to automate thisprocess, we have shown that automatic markup and visualisation of abstracts?
information structurecan accelerate it considerably (Guo et al., 2011).
The model of information structure incorporated inCRAB 2.0 is based on argumentative zoning (Teufel and Moens, 2002; Mizuta et al., 2006; Teufel, 2010),whereby the text of a scientific abstract (or article) is segmented into blocks of sentences that carry aspecific rhetorical function and combine to communicate the argument the authors wish to convey tothe reader.
The markup scheme used in our system labels each sentence with one of seven categories:background, objective, method, result, conclusion, related work and future work (Guo et al., 2010).
TheCRAB system incorporates preprocessing (lemmatisation, POS tagging, parsing) with the C&C toolkit3and information structure markup with an SVM classifier that labels sentences according to a combinationof lexical, syntactic and discourse features (Guo et al., 2011).
The classifier has been trained on anannotated dataset of 1,000 CRA abstracts (Guo et al., 2010).The automatic information structure markup is used to support browsing of the set of abstracts assigneda label of interest by the semantic classifier; e.g., the user can inspect all abstracts labelled genotoxic(Figure 3).
Each information structure category is highlighted in a different colour and the user can selecta single category to focus on.
To our knowledge, CRAB 2.0 is the first publicly available online tool thatprovides information structure analysis of biomedical literature.3 EvaluationIntrinsic cross-validation evaluations of the semantic taxonomy classifier and information structureclassifier show high performance: 0.78 macro-averaged F-score (Korhonen et al., 2012) and 0.88 accuracy(Guo et al., 2011), respectively.
Furthermore, user-based evaluation in the context of real-life CRA has2http://www.r-project.org/3http://svn.ask.it.usyd.edu.au/trac/candc78produced promising results.
(Korhonen et al., 2012) showed that the concept distributions produced byour classifier confirmed known properties of chemicals without human input.
Guo et al.
(2011) found thatintegrating information structure visualisation in abstract browsing helped risk assessors to find relevantinformation in abstracts 7-8% more quickly.4 UseCRAB 2.0 is freely available as an in-browser application at http://omotesando-e.cl.cam.ac.uk/CRAB/request.html.
New users can register an id and password to allow them to storeand retrieve data from previous sessions.
Alternatively, they can use an anonymous guest account (idguest@coling, password guest@coling).5 ConclusionWe have presented Version 2.0 of CRAB, the first NLP tool for supporting the workflow of literaturereview for cancer risk assessment.
CRAB meets a real, specialised need and is already being used toimprove the efficiency of CRA work.
Although currently focused on cancer, CRAB can be easily adaptedto other health risks provided with the appropriate taxonomy and annotated data for machine learning.
Inthe future, the tool can be developed further in various ways, e.g.
to support submissions in other formatsthan PubMed XML; to take into account journal impact factors, number of citations and cross referencesto better organize the literature; and to offer enriched statistical analysis of classified literature.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Royal Society, Vinnova and the Swedish Research Council.ReferencesWendy W.
