When taggers developed in one domain are used in another domain, the performance can degrade considerably.
We present a method for developing taggers for new domains without requiring POS annotated text in the new domain.
Our method involves using raw domain text and identifying related words to form a domain specific lexicon.
This lexicon provides the initial lexical probabilities for EM training of an HMM model.
We evaluate the method by apply-ing it in the Biology domain and show that we achieve results that are comparable with some taggers developed for this domain.
1 Introduction As Natural Language Processing (NLP) technol-ogy advances and more text becomes available, it is being applied more and often in specialized do-mains.
Part of Speech (POS) tagging is often a fundamental component to these NLP applications and hence its accuracy can have a significant im-pact on the application?s success.
The success that the taggers have attained is often not replicated when the domain is changed.
Degradation of accu-racy in a new domain can be overcome by devel-oping an annotated corpus for that specific domain, e.g., as in the Biology domain.
However, this solu-tion is feasible only if there is sufficient interest in the use of NLP technology in that domain, and there are sufficient funding and resources.
In con-trast, our approach is to use existing resources, andrapidly develop taggers for new domains without using the time and effort to develop annotated data.
In this work, we use the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus (Marcus et al 1993) and large amounts of domain-specific raw text to develop taggers.
We evaluate our methodology in the Biol-ogy domain and show the resulting performance is competitive with some taggers built with super-vised learning for that domain.
Also, we note that the accuracy of taggers trained on the WSJ corpus drops off considerably when applied to this domain.
Smith et al (2005) report that the Brill tagger (1995) has an accuracy of 86.8% on 1000 sen-tences taken from Medline, and that the Xerox tag-ger (Cutting et al.1992) has an accuracy of 93.1% on the same sentences.
They attribute this drop off to the fact that only 57.8% of the 10,000 most fre-quent words can be found in WSJ corpus.
This ob-servation provides further impetus to developing lexicon for taggers in the new domains.
In the next section, we discuss our general ap-proach.
The details of the EM training of the HMM tagger are given in Section 3.
Section 4 provides details of how a domain specific lexicon is created.
Next, we discuss the evaluation of our models and analysis based on the results.
Section 6 discusses related work and those works from which we have taken some ideas.
Section 7 has some concluding remarks.
2 Basic Methodology Inadequate treatment of domain-specific vocabu-lary is often the primary cause in the degradation of performance when a tagger trained in one genre of text is ported to a new domain.
The significance of out-of-vocabulary words has been noted in re-duced accuracy of NLP components in the Biology1103domain (e.g., Lease and Charniak, 2005; Smith et al 2004).
The handling of domain-specific vocabu-lary is the focus of our approach.
It is quite common to use suffix information in the prediction of POS tags for occurrences of new words.
However, its effectiveness may be limited in English, which is not a highly inflected language.
However, even for English, we find that not only can suffix information be used online during tag-ging, but also the presence or absence of morpho-logically related words can provide considerable information to pre-build a lexicon that associates possible tags with words.
Consider the example of the word ?broaden?.
While the suffix ?en?
may be utilized to predict the likelihood of verbal tags (VB and VBP) for the word during tagging, if we were to build a lexicon offline, the existence of the words ?broadened?, ?broadening?, ?broadens?
and ?broad?
give further evidence to treat ?broaden?
as a verb.
This type of information has been used before in (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 2000).
In the above example, the presence or absence of words with the suffix morphemes suggests POS tag information in two ways: 1) The presence of a suffix morpheme in a word suggests a POS tag or a small set of POS tags for the word.
This is the type of information most taggers use to predict tags for unknown words during the tagging process; 2) The presence of the morpheme can also indicate possi-ble tags for the words it attaches to.
For example, the derivational morpheme ?ment?
indicates ?gov-ernment?
is likely to be an NN and also that the word it attaches to, ?govern?
is likely to be a verb.
Inflectional and derivational morphemes don?t at-tach to words of just any POS category; they are particular.
Thus, we can propose the possibility of JJ (adjective) to ?broad?
and VB or VBP to ?gov-ern?
(based on the fact the derivational morphemes ?en?
and ?ment?
attach to them) even though by themselves they don?t have any suffix information that might be indicative of JJ and VB or VBP.
Additional suffixes (that may or may not be taken from a standard list of English inflectional and derivational morphemes) can also be used.
As an example, the suffix ?ate?
can be associated with a small set of tags: VB or VBP (?educate?, ?cre-ate?
), JJ (?adequate?, ?appropriate?
), and NN (?candidate?, ?climate?).
Note the possibility or impossibility of the addition of ?tion?
and ?ly?
can help distinguish between the verbal and adjectivalsituations.
In contrast, most taggers that use just suffix information during the tagging process will need strong contextual information (i.e., tags of nearby words) in making their prediction for each occurrence, as such suffixes can be associated with multiple tags.
To utilize such information, we need a diction-ary of words in the domain for which we are inter-ested in building a tagger.
Such a dictionary will allow us to propose possible tags for a domain word such as ?phosphorylate?.
If we can verify whether words like ?phosphorylation?, ?phos-phorylates?, and ?phosphorylately,?
are available in the domain then we can obtain considerable in-formation regarding the possible tags that can be associated with ?phosphorylate?.
But we cannot assume the availability of a dictionary of words in the domain.
However, it would suffice to have a large text corpus, which we call Text-Lex.
We use it as a proxy for a domain dictionary by obtaining a list of words and their relative frequency of ap-pearance in the domain.
Rather than using manually developed rules that assign possible tags for words based on the pres-ence or absence of related words, we wish to apply a more empirical methodology.
Since this sort of information is specific to a language rather than a domain, we can use an annotated corpus in another domain to provide exemplars.
We use the WSJ (Marcus et al 1993) corpus, a POS annotated cor-pus, for this purpose.
For example, we can see that ?phosphorylate?
in the Biology domain and ?cre-ate?
in the WSJ corpus are similar in the sense both take on ?tion?, ?ed?, and ?ing?
suffixes but not ?ly?
for instance.
Since the WSJ corpus would provide POS tag information for ?create?, we can use it to inform us for ?phosphorylate?.
The above method forms the basis for our de-termination of the set of tags that are to be associ-ated with the domain words.
However, the actual tag to be assigned for an occurrence in text de-pends on the context of use.
We capture this in-formation by using a first-order HMM tagger model.
For the transitional probabilities, we begin by using WSJ-based probabilities as a starting point and then adjust to the new domain by using a domain specific text and using EM training.
EM also allows for adjusting lexical probabilities de-rived using WSJ words as exemplars.
We call the domain specific text used for training of our HMM tagger as Text-EM.
While this could be the same1104as Text-Lex, we distinguish the two since Text-EM could be smaller than Text-Lex.
From Text-Lex, we only extract a list of words and their frequency of occurrences.
In contrast, we use Text-EM as a text and hence as a sequence of words.
In this work, the set of suffixes that we use is adapted those found in a GRE preparation web-page (DeForest, 2000).
A few additional suffixes were obtained from the online English Dictionary AllWords.com (2005).
In the future we expect to consider automatic mining of useful suffixes from a domain.
Furthermore, prefixes are also useful for our purposes.
However apart from a few prefixes used in hyphenated words, we haven?t yet incorpo-rated prefix information in a systematic way into our framework.
In this paper, our evaluation domain is molecu-lar biology.
Large amounts of text are easily avail-able in the form of Medline abstracts.
We use only about 1% of the Medline text database for Text-Lex.
Another reason for selecting this evaluation domain is that we have a considerable amount POS-annotated text in this domain, and the most recent techniques of supervised POS tag learning have been used in developing taggers for this do-main.
This allows us to evaluate our tagger using the annotated text for evaluation as well as to com-pare our tagger with others developed for this do-main.
The POS-annotated text we use is the well-known GENIA (Tateisi et al 2003) corpus that was developed at University of Tokyo.
3 Expectation Maximization Training Our tagger is a first-order Hidden Markov Model (HMM) tagger that is trained using Expectation Maximization (EM) since we do not assume exis-tence of annotated data in the new domain.1 Al-though we use the GENIA corpus, we take only the raw text and strip off the annotated information for obtaining the Text-EM.
Our HMM is based on bi-gram modeling and hence our transitional prob-abilities correspond to P(t | t?)
where t and t?
are POS tags.
The emissions that label the transition edges will be discussed in the next section and in-clude domain words as well as certain types of ?coded words?.
1 We considered a 2nd order model as well, but early work showed negligible advantage predicting to the same training set.
Following Wang and Schuurmans (2005) we chose to focus on quality of estimation over model complexity.The initial transitional probabilities are not ran-domly chosen but rather taken from the WSJ cor-pus.
If we take the transitional probabilities as a representation of syntactic preferences, then EM learning using Text-EM may be taken as adjust-ment of the grammatical preferences in the WSJ corpus to those in the new domain.
In order to ad-just the grammatical preference to the new domain, we start from smoothed WSJ bigram probabilities.
If we started from unsmoothed WSJ bigram prob-abilities, then EM would not allow us to account for transitions that are not observed in the WSJ corpus.
For example, in scientific text, transition from RRB (the right round bracket) to VBG may be possible, while it does not occur in the WSJ corpus.
Hence, we smooth the WSJ bigram prob-abilities with WSJ unigram probabilities.
We compute smoothed initial bigram probabili-ties as P(t | t?)
= ?
PWSJ(t | t?)
+ (1-?)
PWSJ(t), where ?=0.9.
We felt employing techniques sug-gested in (Brants, 2000) gave too high a preference for unigram probabilities.
The initial emit probability is obtained from the domain text Text-Lex.
The process is described in the next section.
This information is derived purely from suffix and suffix distribution, or from ortho-graphic information and does not account for the actual context of occurrences in the domain text.
We take this suffix-based (and orthographic-based) emit probabilities as reasonable initial lexical probabilities.
EM training will adjust them as nec-essary.
We made one minor modification to the stan-dard forward-backward EM algorithm.
We dampen the change in transitional and emit probabilities for each iteration.
Significant differences in lexical probabilities between the new domain and WSJ can make undue changes in transitional probabili-ties and this in turn can further lead the lexical probabilities to head in the wrong direction.
By adding a damping factor, we can prevent the unsu-pervised training to spiral out of control.
Hence we let the new transitional probability be given by  P(t | t?)
= ?
PNEW(t | t?)
+ (1-?)
POLD(t | t?)
where POLD represents the transitional probability in the previous iteration and PNEW represents the probability by standard use of forward-backward algorithm.
We use a damping factor of 0.5 for both transitional and emit probabilities.
For the emit probabilities, this has the effect of moderating POS1105preferences derived from the training data and pre-serving words and POSes from the lexicon for use in the test set.
Even with the damping factor, EM learning fol-lowed the pattern of ?Early Maximum?
described by Elworthy (1994), where with good initial esti-mates EM learning only improves accuracy for a few iterations.
For our EM training, we fixed it-eration 2 as our ?best?
EM trained model.
4 Development of the Lexicon and Initial Probabilities As noted earlier, we use a domain text, Text-Lex, to develop the initial lexical probabilities for the HMM.
The essential process is as follows.
Let a word w appear a sufficient number of times in Text-Lex (at least 5 times).
We look in Text-Lex for related words in order to assign a feature vector with this word.
Each feature is written as ?x+y, where x and y represent suffixes or the empty string (here represented as _).
Features: The feature ?x+y represents the word formed by replacing some suffix x in w by some suffix y.
Consider the word ?creation?.
??ion+_?
corresponds to the stem word ?create?
and ??ion+ion?
corresponds to the word ?creation?
itself.
The feature ??ion+ed?
captures information about the word ?created?
whereas the feature ?-_+s?
cor-responds to word ?creations?.
Now consider a word like ?history?.
While this might have non-zero values for ?-y+ic?
(historic) or ?-_+s?
(histories), we are likely to set zero value for ??ory+_?
(unless ?hist?
or ?histe?
is found in Text-Lex).
This zero value represents the fact that although ?history?
has ?ory?
as a suffix, it has no stem.
Such a distinction (whether or not there is a stem) bears much information for suffixes like ?ate?
and ?ory?.
We use suffix classes rather than actual suffixes as we believe this provides a more appropriate level of abstraction.
Given a word w with a suffix x (for a word with no suffix from our list of suf-fixes, x is taken to be _.
i.e., empty string), we ex-amine whether removal of x from w leads to an-other word by using a few basic variations that can be found in any rudimentary exposition on English morphology.
For example, for the suffix ?ed?, we attempt to replace ?ied?
with ?y?
which relates ?purified?
with ?purify?
and recognizes the spell-ing alternation of i/y.
Thus for the word ?purify?the feature ?-+ed?
represents the presence of ?pu-rified?
since ?+ed?
represents the suffix class rather than the actual suffix.
Similarly, we also consider removal of a suffix and, if necessary, add-ing an ?e?
to see if such a word exists.
This allows us to relate ?creation?
with ?create?
or ?activate?
with ?active?.
Also doubling of a few consonants is attempted to relate ?occurrence?
and ?occur?.
Finally, when a word could have two suffixes, the word is considered to always have the longer func-tional suffix.
Hence, we consider ?government?
to have ?ment?
suffix rather than ?ent?
suffix.
Feature Vectors: There are two different types of vectors we use for any word, one called Bin (for binary count) and other called RFreq (for relative frequency).
In the Bin vector associated with ?creation?, all these four features will get the value one, assuming that the four corresponding words are found in Text-Lex.
On the other hand, assuming ?creatory?
is not found in Text-Lex, the feature ?-ion+ory?
would get a zero value.
For RFreq vector, instead of ones and zeros, we first start with the frequency of occurrences of each word and then normalize so that the sum of all fea-ture values is one.
Thus, for example, a word with 4 features having non-zero frequencies of 10, 20, 30 and 40 will have the respective values set to 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4.
A word with four features having non-zero frequency, which are 1, 2, 3 and 4, will also have same 4 relative frequency values.
Our intuition is that the Bin vector is helpful in determining the set of tags that can be associated with a word and that the RFreq vector can aug-ment this information regarding the likelihood of these tags.
For example, a one for the ?-ing+_?
feature in a Bin vector (thus disqualifying a word like ?during?)
may be sufficient to predict VBG, JJ and NN tags.
However, this may not suffice to provide the ordering of likelihood among these tags for this word.
On the other hand, it seems to be the case that when the ?ing?
form appears far more often than the ?ed?
form, then the NN tag is most likely.
But if the ?ed?
form is more frequent, then VBG is most likely.
Examples in the WSJ corpus include ?smoking?, ?marketing?, ?index-ing?, and ?restructuring?
for the first kind, and ?calling?, ?counting?, ?advising?, and ?noting?
for the second kind.
Exemplars in WSJ: Given a word w from Text-Lex, we look for similar words from the WSJ cor-pus.
Even though the set of words used in this cor-1106pus may differ substantially from the domain text, our hypothesis is that words with similar suffix distribution will have similar POS tag assignments regardless of the domain.
We follow Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2000) in using the kNN method for finding similar words, but we differ in details of the construction of the feature vectors and distance computation.
For the word w we create the Bin and RFreq vectors based on distribution of words in Text-Lex.
Following the same method, we create the Bin and RFreq vectors for a word v in the WSJ corpus by using the distributions in the WSJ cor-pus.
Then we compute BinDist(w,v) as the number of features in which the two Bin vectors  differ.
A similar RFDist is defined as a weighted sum of two distances: the first distance is L1-norm dis-tance based on values of features for which both words have non-zero values for and the second distance is based on values of features for which one word has a zero value and other does not.
Thus, if the two words?
RFreq vectors are?< w1,...,wn>  and?< v1,...,vn>respectively then?RFsame(w,v) = wi?
viwi?0?vi?0?
?RFdiff (w,v) =wi?
viwi=0?
vi?0?+ wi?
viwi?0?
vi=0?and,?RFDist ( w,v ) = RFsame( w,v ) +?RFdiff ( w,v ) For RFDist(.
), we used ?
=2.
Given a word w, we find the 5 nearest neighbors from the WSJ cor-pus and use their average lexical probabilities to obtain the lexical probabilities for w. We investi-gate the use of Bin vector information and RFreq vector information for computing the distances (i.e., BinDist(.)
and RFDist(.))
as well as a hybrid measure that combines these two distances.
We also considered smoothing the lexical prob-abilities obtained in the above fashion.
Let w be a word for which the above method suggests tags t1,?,tn in order of likelihood (t1 is most probable).
Then we consider sqrt-score(ti)=?n +1?
i .
We then assign probabilities based on this score after normalizing them so that the probabilities for the n tags will sum to 1.
Thus, for example, if a word w has three possible tags, no matter what the original lexical probabilities were determined to be, if t1 isdetermined to be most probable, then P(t1|w) will be 0.418 by this method.
The second most prob-able tag will be assigned 0.341.
The intuition behind this square root smoothing method is that this smoothing may be appropriate for low frequency words, where empirical prob-abilities based purely on a kNN basis may not be entirely appropriate if the new domain is very dif-ferent.
The drawback of course is that if there is sufficient information, we lose useful information by such flattening.
And when a tag is significantly more probable for a word then we lose this vital information.
For example, the word ?high?
is mostly annotated as JJ in WSJ corpus but RB and NN are also possible.
Square root smoothing will flatten this distribution considerably.
Nevertheless, we wish to investigate whether this method of smoothing the distribution is enough in conjunc-tion with EM.
EM adjusts the probability from observing the number and context of occurrences in the domain text.2  Coded Words: No matter how large Text-Lex is, there will be words that do not appear a suffi-cient number of times (we take this number to be 5).
We aggregate such words according to their suffixes, if they correspond to one of the prede-fined suffixes.
Then each word with suffix x is considered to be an instance of a ?coded?
word SFX-x.
If a word does not have any of these suf-fixes then they fall into the coded class unknown.
For each such coded word, we assign the tags and probabilities based on similarly aggregated words in the WSJ corpus.
We have two other broad classes of words that we treat differently.
Coded words are formed based on orthographic characteristics, which include but are not limited to Greek letters, Roman numerals, digits, upper or lower case single letters, upper case letter sequences, cardinals, certain prefix words, and their combinations.
Since they are rela-tively easy to tag, we do not use the WSJ corpus for them but handle it programmatically.
Finally, if a word occurs often in WSJ or is assigned tags such as CD, FW, MD, PRP, DT, WDT, etc.
(tags which can?t be predicted by means of suffix or suf-fix-related words), we add this word together with the tags and probability into the domain lexicon that we are building.
2 We also considered linear and square functions for smooth-ing while reporting only the sqrt results in section 5.11075 Evaluation and Analysis As noted earlier, our evaluation is on molecular biology text.
For Text-Lex, we used 133,666 ti-tles/abstracts of research papers, a small fraction of the Medline database available from the National Library of Medicine.
These abstracts were con-tained in just five of the 500 compressed data files in the 2006 version of the Medline database.
These abstracts cover topics more broadly in Biomedicine and not just molecular biology.
On the other hand, we use for Text-EM, text which can be regarded to be in a subfield of molecular biology.
Text-EM is the text from the GENIA corpus (version 3.02) described in (Tateisi et al 2003).
This corresponds to about 2000 abstracts, which are annotated with POS tag information (using the same tags used in the WSJ corpus).
We use a 5-fold cross-validation, i.e., 5 partitions are formed and experiments conducted 5 times and results av-eraged.
For each test partition, the remainder parti-tions are used for ?training?.
In our case, this is unsupervised since we use EM and hence we to-tally disregard the POS tag information that is as-sociated with the words.
We note that both the text for EM training as well as for testing come from the same domain.
We first evaluate the process of building the lexicon.
This time we consider the entire GENIA corpus and not any partition.
We first considered all words in the GENIA corpus for which we can expect our kNN method to assign a tag.
Hence all words that would be treated as coded words are ignored.
For each such word, we consider the tags assigned to them in the GENIA corpus and form pairs <w,t>.
We are interested in the word type and not token and hence we will not have any mul-tiple occurrences of a pair <w,t>.
Our kNN method identifies 96.3% of these pairs; we can think of this as recall.
This makes our approach effective, espe-cially given the fact that the kNN method only as-signs 1.92 tags on an average to these words in the GENIA corpus.
Next considering all words appear-ing in the GENIA corpus, our lexicon includes a correct tag in 99.0% of the cases on a word-token basis.
These results are summarized below.
Characteristic Statistic kNN Recall (word-type) 96.3% Average Number Tags/Word 1.92 tags Lexicon Recall (word-token) 99.0%We now turn to the evaluation of the accuracy of our HMM.
As mentioned earlier, these results are based on 5-fold cross-validation experiments.
The best results (95.77%) were obtained for the case where we took the lexical probabilities directly from kNN using only RFDist and by discarding all tags assigned with probability less than 0.02.3  These results compare favorably to other taggers developed for the Biology domain.
The MedPost tagger (see Section 6) achieved an accuracy of 94.1% when we applied it to the GENIA abstracts.
The PennBioIE tagger (see Section 6) achieved an accuracy of 95.1%.
Note that output from the PennBioIE tagger is not fully compatible with GENIA annotation due to some differences in its tokenization.
Even if the differences in accuracies can be discounted due to tokenization or even sys-tematic differences in annotation between the train-ing and test corpora, our main point is that our re-sults compare favorably (our tagger competitive) with taggers that were developed for the Biomedi-cine domain using supervised training.
These results are summarized in the table below.
POS Tagger %Accuracy Our HMM (5-fold) 95.77% MedPost 94.1% PennBioIE 95.1% GENIA supervised 98.26%  MedPost seems intended to cover all of Bio-medicine, since its lexicon is based on the 10,000 most frequently occurring words from Medline and for which the set of possible tags were manually specified.
The PennBioIE tagger was developed using 315 Medline abstracts using another subfield of molecular biology.
None of these accuracies however are as high as those of the GENIA tagger (Tsuruoka et al 2005) which was trained (supervised) using GENIA cor-pus and uses a machine learning model more so-phisticated than the simple first-order HMM tagger we use.
This model considers more features includ-ing words to the right.
The best results (98.26%) were obtained when lexicon from three different sources were aggregated.
3 Banko and Moore (2004) showed only slight improvement in tag accuracy between .01 and .1 cutoffs with a lexicon built from annotated data.
We opted for the .02 cutoff because of our ?noisier?
lexicon.1108Returning to the results for our taggers, we also tried BinDist in the kNN method, with and without square root smoothing.
These results were typi-cally less than the above-mentioned result.
We also compared using a square root smooth on RFDist obtaining results approximately 1% lower than without the square root smooth.
We next present some examples that illustrate strengths and weaknesses of the current model.
An example that shows that EM training makes good adjustment to the domain is the improvement in tagging of verbal categories.
We conducted a de-tailed error analysis on one of the cross-validation partitions and noted that the accuracy on all verbal POS tags improved after EM training.
A notewor-thy case is the improvement in tagging of VBP originally misclassified as VB.
Since most English words that are VB can also be VBP, and since they are annotated more frequently in WSJ as VB, the initial lexicon usually has a higher probability as-signed to VB for most words.
As EM training pro-gresses, we noted that the frequency of VBP mistagged as VB decreases.
Similarly, misclassifi-cations of VBG as NN also drops in the final model (by 40.3% on Text-EM) as compared to the initial model based on WSJ transitional probabili-ties and initial lexicon derived using WSJ words as exemplars.
Previously, in the context of parsing Biomedical text, Lease and Charniak (2004) mention the oc-currences of sequences of multiple NN is more frequent in the GENIA corpus than in the WSJ corpus and that it could lead to parsing errors.
We didn?t observe this problem here, but rather the contrary situation where many JJs were initially mistagged as NN.
About 22% of these misclassifi-cations are corrected after EM training.
While our model adjusts well in these cases to the new domain, sometimes the drift leads to worse performance.
An example is in the misclassifica-tion of VBN as JJ.
The most frequent word for which this misclassification occurs in the word ?activated?.
These misclassifications occur in the context such as ?the activated cells?.
The use of VBN rather than JJ is hard to determine on basis of just surface features and perhaps has to do more with the meaning of the word.
In supervised set-ting, if sufficient such cases were annotated then this would be learned.
But in an unsupervised set-ting this turns out to be a problem case.
Despite the fact that RFDist predicted VBN as most probabletag for ?activated?, EM training makes this situa-tion worse.
Analysis of words with most frequent errors re-vealed many cases from orthographic coded words.
Many occurrences of single lower case letters (which could have LS, SYM or NN tags) were la-beled as LS whereas the GENIA tagging used NN.
Our model tagged ?+/-?
always as SYM whereas because of the context of use, GENIA annotations were CC.
(In fact, GENIA does not appear to use the SYM tag.)
Similarly, ?<?
and ?>?
were often mistagged as SYM by our model whereas based on context they are annotated as JJR.
6 Related Work The impact of out-of-vocabulary words on NLP applications has been noted before.
The degrada-tion in performance of components, which were trained on the WSJ corpus, but used on biomedical text has been noted (Lease and Charniak, 2004, Smith et al 2005).
Smith et al (2005) use this ob-servation in the design of their POS tagger, Med-Post, by building a Markov model with a lexicon containing the 10,000 most frequent words from Medline, and using annotated text from the Bio-medical text for supervised training.
There are many unsupervised approaches to POS tagging.
We focus now on those that are most closely related to our work and contain ideas that have influenced this work.
There have been many uses of EM training to build HMM taggers (Kupiec, 1992; Elworthy, 1994; Banko and Moore, 2004; Wang and Schuurmans, 2005).
Banko and Moore (2004) achieved better accuracy by restrict-ing the set of possible tags that are associated with words.
By eliminating possibilities that may appear rarely with a word, they reduce the chances of un-supervised training spiraling along an unlikely path.
We believe by using our approach we con-siderably reduce the set of tags to what is appropri-ate for each word.
Further, we too remove any tag associated with low probability by kNN method.
Usually these tags are noise introduced by some inappropriate exemplar.
Wang and Schuurman (2005) suggest that EM algorithm be modified such that at any iteration the unigram tag probability be held constant to the true probability for each tag.
Again, this might serve to stop a drift in unsupervised methods towards mak-ing a tag?s probability become larger than it should1109be.
However, the true probability cannot be known ahead of time and certainly not in a new domain.
While a WSJ bigram probability need not reflect the corresponding preferences in the new domain, our use of starting from WSJ probabilities and then damping changes to transition probabilities was motivated by a similar concern of not letting a drift towards making some (bigram) tags too frequent during EM iterations.
Using suffixation patterns for purposes of pre-dicting POS tags has been considered before.
Al-though as far as we know, we are the first to apply it for domain adaptation purposes.
Schone and Ju-rafsky (2001) consider clusters of words (obtained by some ?perfect?
clustering algorithm) and then compute a measure of how ?affixy?
a cluster is.
For example, a cluster containing words ?climb?
and ?jump?
may be related by suffixing operation +s to a cluster that contains words ?climbs?
and ?jumps?.
The percentage of words in a cluster that are so related provides a measure of how ?affixy?
a cluster.
This together with five other attributes of clusters (such as whether words in a cluster pre-cede those of another cluster, optionality) and lan-guage universals induce POS tags for these clusters from corpora.
This method does not use POS tagged corpora (although in the reported experi-ment the initial ?perfect?
clusters were obtained from the Brown corpus using the POS tag informa-tion).
In contrast, we use the POS tagged WSJ cor-pus to assist in the induction of tag information for our lexicon.
In this respect, our method is closer to the approach of Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2000).
Our use of the kNN method to identify tags and their probabilities for words was inspired by this work.
However, their use of kNN method was in the context of supervised learning.
The method was applied for handling words unseen in the train-ing data.
The estimated probabilities were used during the tagging process.
Instead of just applying the method for unknown words, i.e., words not present in the training data, our approach is to cre-ate the entire lexicon in the new domain.
As Lease and Charniak (2004), among others, have noted, the distribution of NN tag sequences as well as tag distributions in the Biomedical domain could differ from WSJ text.
Since our aim is to adjust to the new domain, we employed unsupervised learning in the form of EM training, unlike the supervised tagging model development approach of Cucerzan and Yarowsky.
Another significant difference isthat their method determines nearest neighbors not only on the basis of suffix-related words but also on the basis of nearby words context.
Since our motivation, on the other hand, is to move to a new domain, we didn?t consider detection of similarity on the basis of word contexts.
In contrast, we have shown that the approach of identifying words on the basis of suffixation patterns and using them as exemplars can be applied effectively even when the domain of application is substantially different from the text (the WSJ corpus) providing the ex-emplars.
7 Conclusions As NLP technology continues to be applied in new domains, it becomes more important to consider the issue of portability to new domains.
To cope with domain-specific vocabulary and also different use of vocabulary in a new domain, we exploited suffix information of words.
While use of suffix information per se has been employed in many ex-isting POS taggers, its use is often limited to an online manner, where each word is examined inde-pendently from the existence of its morphologi-cally related words.
As shown in (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 2000), such information can provide considerable information to build a lexicon that associates possible tags with words.
However, we use this information only to provide the initial val-ues.
We apply EM algorithm to adjust these initial probabilities to the new domain.
The results in Section 5 show that we achieve good performance in the evaluation domain, which is comparable with two recently developed taggers for this domain.
We also show in section 5 exam-ples of how EM unlearns some WSJ bias and ad-justs to the new domain.
While we introduce a damping factor to slow down changes in iterations of EM training, we believe there is scope for fur-ther improvement to minimize drift.
Furthermore, there is scope to improve our kNN method as dis-cussed at the end of Section 5.
In the future, we also expect to consider methods that may auto-matically mine suffixes in a new domain and use these domain-specific suffixes.
We used the kNN method to associate words in the new domain with possible POS tags.
Despite the often-stated notion that English is not morphologically rich, we find that suffix-based methods can still help make significant inroads.1110Our method offers the chance to develop good tag-gers for specialized domains.
For example, the GENIA corpus and PennBioIE corpus are speciali-zations within molecular biology, but taggers de-veloped on one corpus degrades in performance on the other.
Using our method, we could use differ-ent Text-EM for these specializations even if we retain Medline as Text-Lex.
In the same way, we could develop a tagger for the medical domain, which has a distinct vocabulary from biology.
