Commercial Implementation of Text Recognition Tools for VLCJohn RauschSenior S~fr ConsultantLexis-Nexisjohn.musch@,lexis-nexis.comResearchers typically use traditional lexical scanner and parser tools for projects requiringthe recognition of complex text elements.
The role relegated to the lexical scanner isusually the simple tokenization while the relationships of the tokens to one another isdone by the parser.
Implementation f products or features using these tools for VLC canrequire months of processing or even years.In this talk, I will describe how extending the capabilities of the lexical scanner whileoptlmi~ng its performance an allow it to complete the recognition work traditionallydone by parsers.
This technique allows for flexible reprocessing of VLC that mightotherwise not be done when improvements to algorithms are made.
I will illustrate thiswith a case study of the recognition of embedded case law citations, including anaphoricreferences, and case names.2!
