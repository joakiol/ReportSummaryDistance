A secondaspect involves optimizing the processleading to their integration in applica-tions.
With this respect, we believe thatthe production of a consensual specifica-tion on multilingual lexicons can be auseful aid for the various NLP actors.Within ISO, one purpose of LMF (ISO-24613) is to define a standard for lexi-cons that covers multilingual data.1 IntroductionLexical Markup Framework (LMF) is a modelthat provides a common standardized frameworkfor the construction of Natural Language Proc-essing (NLP) lexicons.
The goals of LMF are toprovide a common model for the creation anduse of lexical resources, to manage the exchangeof data between and among these resources, andto enable the merging of a large number of indi-vidual electronic resources to form extensiveglobal electronic resources.Types of individual instantiations of LMF caninclude monolingual, bilingual or multilinguallexical resources.
The same specifications are tobe used for both small and large lexicons.
Thedescriptions range from morphology, syntax,semantic to translation information organized asdifferent extensions of an obligatory core pack-age.
The model is being developed to cover allnatural languages.
The range of targeted NLPapplications is not restricted.
LMF is also used tomodel machine readable dictionaries (MRD),which are not within the scope of this paper.2 History and current contextIn the past, this subject has been studied and de-veloped by a series of projects like GENELEX[Antoni-Lay], EAGLES, MULTEXT, PAROLE,SIMPLE, ISLE and MILE [Bertagna].
More re-cently within ISO1 the standard for terminologymanagement has been successfully elaborated bythe sub-committee three of ISO-TC37 and pub-lished under the name "Terminology MarkupFramework" (TMF) with the ISO-16642 refer-ence.
Afterwards, the ISO-TC37 National dele-gations decided to address standards dedicated toNLP.
These standards are currently elaborated ashigh level specifications and deal with wordsegmentation (ISO 24614), annotations(ISO 24611, 24612 and 24615), feature struc-tures (ISO 24610), and lexicons (ISO 24613)with this latest one being the focus of the currentpaper.
These standards are based on low levelspecifications dedicated to constants, namelydata categories (revision of ISO 12620), lan-guage codes (ISO 639), script codes(ISO 15924), country codes (ISO 3166), dates(ISO 8601) and Unicode (ISO 10646).This work is in progress.
The two level organiza-tion will form a coherent family of standardswith the following simple rules:1) the low level specifications provide standard-ized constants;1 www.iso.org12) the high level specifications provide struc-tural elements that are adorned by the standard-ized constants.3 Scope and challengesThe task of designing a lexicon model that satis-fies every user is not an easy task.
But all theefforts are directed to elaborate a proposal thatfits the major needs of most existing models.In order to summarise the objectives, let's seewhat is in the scope and what is not.LMF addresses the following difficult chal-lenges:?
Represent words in languages wheremultiple orthographies (native scripts ortransliterations) are possible, e.g.
someAsian languages.?
Represent explicitly (i.e.
in extension)the morphology of languages where a de-scription of all inflected forms (from a listof lemmatised forms) is manageable, e.g.English.?
Represent the morphology of languageswhere a description in extension of all in-flected forms is not manageable (e.g.
Hun-garian).
In this case, representation in in-tension is the only manageable issue.?
Easily associate written forms and spo-ken forms for all languages.?
Represent complex agglutinating com-pound words like in German.?
Represent fixed, semi-fixed and flexiblemultiword expressions.?
Represent specific syntactic behaviors,as in the Eagles recommendations.?
Allow complex argument mapping be-tween syntax and semantic descriptions, asin the Eagles recommendations.?
Allow a semantic organisation based onSynSets (like in WordNet) or on semanticpredicates (like in FrameNet).?
Represent large scale multilingual re-sources based on interlingual pivots or ontransfer linking.LMF does not address the following topics:?
General sentence grammar of a language?
World knowledge representationIn other words, LMF is mainly focused on thelinguistic representation of lexical information.4 Key standards used by LMFLMF utilizes Unicode in order to represent theorthographies used in lexical entries regardless oflanguage.Linguistic constants, like /feminine/ or/transitive/, are not defined within LMF but arespecified in the Data Category Registry (DCR)that is maintained as a global resource byISO TC37 in compliance with ISO/IEC 11179-3:2003.The LMF specification complies with themodeling principles of Unified Modeling Lan-guage (UML) as defined by OMG2 [Rumbaugh2004].
A model is specified by a UML class dia-gram within a UML package: the class name isnot underlined in the diagrams.
The various ex-amples of word description are represented byUML instance diagrams: the class name is under-lined.5 Structure and core packageLMF is comprised of two components:1) The core package consists of a structuralskeleton that describes the basic hierarchy of in-formation in a lexical entry.2) Extensions to the core package are ex-pressed in a framework that describes the reuseof the core components in conjunction with addi-tional components required for the description ofthe contents of a specific lexical resource.In the core package, the class called Databaserepresents the entire resource and is a containerfor one or more lexicons.
The Lexicon class isthe container for all the lexical entries of thesame language within the database.
The LexiconInformation class contains administrative infor-mation and other general attributes.
The LexicalEntry class is a container for managing the toplevel language components.
As a consequence,the number of representatives of single words,multi-word expressions and affixes of the lexiconis equal to the number of lexical entries in agiven lexicon.
The Form and Sense classes areparts of the Lexical Entry.
Form consists of a textstring that represents the word.
Sense specifies oridentifies the meaning and context of the relatedform.
Therefore, the Lexical Entry manages therelationship between sets of related forms andtheir senses.
If there is more than one orthogra-2 www.omg.org2phy for the word form (e.g.
transliteration) theForm class may be associated with one to manyRepresentation Frames, each of which contains aspecific orthography and one to many data cate-gories that describe the attributes of that orthog-raphy.The core package classes are linked by the re-lations as defined in the following UML classdiagram:Representation FrameLexicon InformationForm SenseEntry RelationSense RelationLexical EntryDatabaseLexicon0..* 0..*0..*10..* 0..*0..*110..*1110..*11..*10..*11..*1..*1Form class can be sub-classed into LemmatisedForm and Inflected Form class as follows:Lemmatised Form Inflected FormFormA subset of the core package classes are ex-tended to cover different kinds of linguistic data.All extensions conform to the LMF core packageand cannot be used to represent lexical data in-dependently of the core package.
From the pointof view of UML, an extension is a UML pack-age.
Current extensions for NLP dictionaries are:NLP Morphology3, NLP inflectional paradigm,NLP Multiword Expression pattern, NLP Syntax,NLP Semantic and Multilingual notations, whichis the focus of this paper.6 NLP Multilingual ExtensionThe NLP multilingual notation extension isdedicated to the description of the mapping be-tween two or more languages in a LMF database.The model is based on the notion of Axis thatlinks Senses, Syntactic Behavior and examplespertaining to different languages.
"Axis" is a3 Morphology, Syntax and Semantic packages aredescribed in [Francopoulo].3term taken from the Papillon4 project [S?rasset2001] 5 .
Axis can be organized at the lexiconmanager convenience in order to link directly orindirectly objects of different languages.6.1 Considerations for standardizing multi-lingual dataThe simplest configuration of multilingualdata is a bilingual lexicon where a single link isused to represent the translation of a givenform/sense pair from one language into another.But a survey of actual practices clearly revealsother requirements that make the model morecomplex.
Consequently, LMF has focused on thefollowing ones:(i) Cases where the relation 1-to-1 is impos-sible because of lexical differences among lan-guages.
An example is the case of English word?river?
that relates to French words ?rivi?re?
and?fleuve?, where the latter is used for specifyingthat the referent is a river that flows into the sea.The bilingual lexicon should specify how theseunits relate.
(ii) The bilingual lexicon approach shouldbe optimized to allow the easiest management oflarge databases for real multilingual scenarios.
Inorder to reduce the explosion of links in a multi-bilingual scenario, translation equivalence can bemanaged through an intermediate "Axis".
Thisobject can be shared in order to contain the num-ber of links in manageable proportions.
(iii) The model should cover both transferand pivot approaches to translation, taking alsointo account hybrid approaches.
In LMF, thepivot approach is implemented by a ?SenseAxis?.
The transfer approach is implemented bya ?Transfer Axis?.
(iv) A situation that is not very easy to dealwith is how to represent translations to languagesthat are similar or variants.
The problem arises,for instance, when the task is to represent transla-tions from English to both European Portugueseand Brazilian Portuguese.
It is difficult to con-4 www.papillon-dictionary.org5 To be more precise, Papillon uses the term "axie"from "axis" and "lexie".
In the beginning of the LMFproject, we used the term "axie" but after some badcomments about using a non-English term in a stan-dard, we decided to use the term "axis".sider them as two separate languages.
In fact, oneis a variant of the other.
The differences are mi-nor: a certain number of words are different andsome limited phenomena in syntax are different.Instead of managing two distinct copies, it ismore effective to manage one lexicon with someobjects that are marked with a dialectal attribute.Concerning the translation from English to Por-tuguese: a limited number of specific Axis in-stances record this variation and the vast major-ity of Axis instances is shared.
(v) The model should allow for representingthe information that restricts or conditions thetranslations.
The representation of tests thatcombine logical operations upon syntactic andsemantic features must be covered.6.2 StructureThe model is based on the notion of Axis thatlink Senses, Syntactic Behavior and examplespertaining to different languages.
Axis can beorganized at the lexicon manager convenience inorder to link directly or indirectly objects of dif-ferent languages.
A direct link is implemented bya single axis.
An indirect link is implemented byseveral axis and one or several relations.The model is based on three main classes:Sense Axis, Transfer Axis, Example Axis.6.3 Sense AxisSense Axis is used to link closely relatedsenses in different languages, under the sameassumptions of the interlingual pivot approach,and, optionally, it can also be used to refer to oneor several external knowledge representation sys-tems.The use of the Sense Axis facilitates the repre-sentation of the translation of words that do notnecessarily have the same valence or morpho-logical form in one language than in another.
Forexample, in a language, we can have a singleword that will be translated by a compound wordinto another language: English ?wheelchair?
toSpanish ?silla de ruedas?.
Sense Axis may havethe following attributes: a label, the name of anexternal descriptive system, a reference to a spe-cific node inside an external description.6.4 Sense Axis RelationSense Axis Relation permits to describe thelinking between two different Sense Axis in-stances.
The element may have attributes likelabel, view, etc.46.6 Transfer Axis RelationTransfer Axis Relation links two Transfer Axisinstances.
The element may have attributes like:label, variation.The label enables the coding of simple inter-lingual relations like the specialization of?fleuve?
compared to ?rivi?re?
and ?river?.
It isnot, however, the goal of this strategy to code acomplex system for knowledge representation,which ideally should be structured as a completecoherent system designed specifically for thatpurpose.6.7 Source Test and Target TestSource Test permits to express a condition onthe translation on the source language side whileTarget Test does it on the target language side.Both elements may have attributes like: text andcomment.6.5 Transfer AxisTransfer Axis is designed to represent multi-lingual transfer approach.
Here, linkage refers toinformation contained in syntax.
For example,this approach enables the representation of syn-tactic actants involving inversion, such as (1):6.8 Example AxisExample Axis supplies documentation forsample translations.
The purpose is not to recordlarge scale multilingual corpora.
The goal is tolink a Lexical Entry with a typical example oftranslation.
The element may have attributes like:comment, source.
(1) fra:?elle me manque?
=>eng:?I miss her?Due to the fact that a lexical entry can be asupport verb, it is possible to represent transla-tions that start from a plain verb to a support verblike (2) that means "Mary dreams":6.9 Class Model DiagramThe UML class model is an UML package.
Thediagram for multilingual notations is as follows:(2)  fra:?Marie r?ve?

In the diagram, French is lo-cated on the left side and English on the rightside.
The axis on the top is not linked directly toany English sense because this notion does notexist in English.

The example is about English on one sideand European Portuguese and Brazilian on theother side.
Due to the fact that these two lastvariants have a very similar syntax, but withsome local exceptions, the goal is to avoid a fulland dummy duplication.
For instance, the nomi-native forms of the third person clitics are largelypreferred in Brazilian rather than the obliqueform as in European Portuguese.
The transferaxis relations hold a label to distinguish whichaxis to use depending on the target object.
: Transfer Axis Relationlabel = European Portuguese: Transfer Axis Relationlabel = Brazilian: Syntactic Behaviorlabel = let me see: Syntactic Behaviorlabel = Deixa eu ver: Syntactic Behaviorlabel = Deixa-me ver: Transfer Axis: Transfer Axis: Transfer Axis7.3 Third exampleA third example shows how to use the Trans-fer Axis relation to relate different information ina multilingual transfer lexicon.
It represents thetranslation of the English ?develop?
into Italianand Spanish.
Recall that the more general senselinks ?eng:develop?
and ?esp:desarrollar?.
Both,Spanish and Italian, have restrictions that should6be tested in the source language: if the secondargument of the construction refers to certainelements (picture, mentalCreation, building) itshould be translated into specific verbs.

In the last ver-sion of the LMF document [LMF 2006] a DTDhas been provided as an informative annex.
Thefollowing conventions are adopted:?
each UML attribute is transcoded as aDC (for Data Category) element?
each UML class is transcoded as anXML element?
UML aggregations are transcoded ascontent inclusion?

We advice the interestedcolleague to consult the technical report "Ex-tended examples of lexicons using LMF" locatedat:  "http://lirics.loria.fr" in the document area.The report explains how to use LMF in order torepresent OLIF-2, Parole/Clips, LC-Star, Word-Net, FrameNet and BD?f.10 ConclusionIn this paper we presented the results of theongoing research activity of the LMF ISO stan-dard.
The design of a common and standardizedframework for multilingual lexical databases willcontribute to the optimization of the use of lexi-cal resources, specially their reusability for dif-ferent applications and tasks.
Interoperability isthe condition of a effective deployment of usablelexical resources.In order to reach a consensus, the work donehas paid attention to the similarities and differ-ences of existing lexicons and the models behindthem.AcknowledgementsThe work presented here is partially funded bythe EU eContent-22236 LIRICS project 6 , par-tially by the French TECHNOLANGUE 7 +OUTILEX8 programs.ReferencesAntoni-Lay M-H., Francopoulo G., Zaysser L. 1994A generic model for reusable lexicons: theGENELEX project.
