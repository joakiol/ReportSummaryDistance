An English-into-Japanese translation systemnamed ATHENE based on a Heuristic Parsing Model (HPM) has beendeveloped.
The experiment shows some advantageous points suchas simplification of transforming and generating phase, semi-localization of multiple meaning resolution, and extendabilityfor future grammatical refinement.
HPM-base parsing process,parsed tree, grammatical data representation, and translationresults are also described.\].
INTRODUCTIONIs i t  true that the recipe to realize a successful machine translation is inprecise and rigid language parsing?
So far many studies have been done on rigidand detailed natural language parsing, some of which are so powerful as to detectsome ungrammatical sentences If ,  2, 3, 4\].
Notwithstanding i t seems that thedetailed parsing is not always connected with practically satisfying machinetranslations.
On the other hand actual human, even foreign language learners, cantranslate fair ly di f f icult  English sentences without going into details of parsing.They only use an elementary grammatical knowledge and dictionaries.Thu.
we have paid attention on the heuristic methods of language-learners and havedew~ed a rather non-standard linguistic model named HPM (= Heuristic ParsingModel).
Here, "non-standard" implies that sentential constituents in HPM aredifferent from those in widely accepted modern English grammars \[5\] or in phrasestructure grammars \[6\].
In order to prove the reasonability of HPM, we havedeveloped an English-into-Japanese translation system named ATHENE (= AutomaticT_ranslation of Hitachi from E_nglish into Nihongo with Editing Support)~f.

(I) To segment an input sentence into new elements named Phrasal Elements (PE)and Clausal Elements (CE),(2) To assign syntactic roles to PE's and CE's, and restructure the segmentedelements into tree-forms by inclusive relation and into list-forms by modify-ing relation.
(3) To permute the segmented elements, and to assiqn appropriate Japanese equiva-lents with necessary case suffixes and postpos~tions.The next section presents an overview of HPM, which is followed in Sec.

3 Intermediate Parsed Tree on HPM (Part 2: from "PE" to Sentence)2.1 Parsed Tree: A parsed sentence is represented in a "tree" or " l ist"  of nodeslinked by pointers.
Each node corresponds to a certain "constituent ofsentence".
"Tree (~/)" is for inclusive relation, and " l i s t  ( '~)"  is formodifying relation.2.2 Constituent: Constituents of sentence is classified into five elements uchas: Word Element, Phrasal Element, Clausal Element, Delimiting Element, andSentence.
And these elements have two values: Attribute and Syntactic Role.2.3 Word Element (WE)~ WE is the smallest consti'tuent, and therefore is an in-separable element in HPM.2.4 Phrasal Element (PE): PE is composed of one or more WE('s) which carries apart of sentential meaning in the smallest possible form.
PE's are mutuallyexclusive.
Typical examples are: "his very ski l l ful  technique (N)", "wouldnot have been doen (V)", and "for everyday production use (PNAL)".2.5 Clausal Element (CE): CE is composed of one or more PE('s) which carries apart of sentential meaning in a nexus-like form.
CE is nearly correspondingto a Japanese simple sentence such as:"'v{wa/ga/wo/no}~,{suru/dearu} \[koto\]~'CE's allow mutual intersection.
Typical examples are the underlined parts inthe following: " I t  is important for you to do so.
"2.L Sentence (SE): SE is composed of one or more CE('s) and is located at thebottom of a parsed tree.2.7 Dependency Pattern of Verb: Verb-dependency-type code is deten~ined bysimplifying Hornby's classification\[ 7\], as iSub-Attr.

Table 2).2.9 Syntactic Role (SR): SR is important o represent parsing results and togenerate Japanese sentences.
For example, the sequencWof SR such as "SUBJ +GOV + OBJ" wi l l  readily imply the Japanese sentence such as "SUBJ + {ga/wa/no} + OBJ + {wo/ni} + GOV".
This implication may be quite natural forlanguage-learners.286 Y. NITTA et al3.
TRANSLATION PROCESSFrom the viewpoint of simplicity and maintenability, i t might be desirable to des-cribe all the Grammatical Data (GD) in static pattern form.
But unfortunately,the pattern form description is lacking in the f lex ib i l i ty  to change controlstructures.
Thus we have adopted a combination of "program" and "pattern" todescribe GD.In the followings, we will describe the translation process along with the ex-amples of grara~atical data (GD) to be referred.
The essential point of the trans-lation process is "to replace some specified node pattern sequences with others,under the appropriate control with grammatical data".
This replacement process iscomposed of following twelve steps:(I) Text Input: To produce upper-most node sequence in the parsed tree.
(2) Morphological Resolution: To reduce the inflected word to root form.
(3) Lexicon Retrieval and Attribute Assignment: To assign all  possible attributesto "WE's".
(4) Ambiguity Resolution in Attributes: To select most l ikely one from amongmany possibi)ities.
(5) Segmentation i to "PE's" and Attribute Assignment: To make a PE from matchedWE group and give attribute(s).
(6) Re-retrieval of Lexicon: To find again possible WE or PE, especially for?
I I  "the separated PE" such as " take , in to  consideratlon .
(7) Syntactic Role Assignment to PE's: To determine Syntactic Role of PE's byreferring a pattern GD as in Fig.

EXPERIi4ENTAL RESULTSA pro~pe machine translation system from English in~ Japanese named ATHENE, asis sketched in Fig.
l ,  has been implemented.
The lexicons contain nearly.tenthousand words, not counting idioms and other multi-word groups, which are mainlycomposed of educational basic words (up to senior-high-school-level in Japan) andof about a thousand computer terminologies.
Our system has translated a series oft t passages extracted randomly from English readers of senior high school andc~ outer system journals.The results of the tests are encouraging on the whole.
The system can trans-late fair ly complicated sen~nces when equiped with the adequate gram~tical dataand idiomatic phrases.
Output sen~nces, even though far from eloquent style, areworth post-editing, and can be considerably improved with multiple meaningcorrection through interactive work.
Some interesting technical findings are thefollowing:(1) The ~llowing items are sometimes yntactically ambiguous to the system.
(i) ING + N (ambiguity among ADJ + SUBJ/OBJ, GOV + OBJ, and ~e like).
( i i )  To-infinitives (ambigui~ be~een adjective and adverbial).
( i i i )  Linking scope ambigui~ w.r.t .
"and", "or", "of" (A and B of C for D).
(iv) Embedded appositional phrases.
(2) Very long PE's (Phrasal Elements) appear occasionally.
(eg.
the PE nodenumbered 52 in Fig.

CONCLUDING REMARKSIn this paper we t~ to contend that machine translation should be studied frommore heuristic side, or from actual language-learner's methodology side ratherthan from purely rigid liguistical analysis side.
Researchers of ve~ "high level"linguistic analysis side, as is poin~d out by Boitet \[8\], "seem too often to con-centrate on in,rest ing high level phenomena s anaphoric re~rence, discourse288 I Y. NITTA et alstructure, causality and reasoning and to forget at the same time persisting andvery frequent lower-level difficulties .
.
.
.  "
This "frequent lower-level d i f f i -culty" is the very problem to be solved in practical machine translation, and isactually solved easily by naive foreign language learners only with the help ofelementary grammatical knowledge.
You had better recall that language-learnersmust solve the whole even though i t  is incomplete, on the other hand, purelinguists must solve completely even though i t  is very limited.In the light of this contention, we have devised a heuristic parsing model namedHPM to accommodate he machine translation to the actual human translationmethodologies, and at the same time, on HPM we have constructed a machine trans-lation system named ATHENE.
Experimental translation by ATHNE shows the follow-ing advantageous points of our heuristic approach.
(1) Contribution to the f lex ib i l i ty ,  simplicity and maintenability in grammaticaldescription.
(2) Contribution to the simplicity and transparency in transforming phase andgenerating phase.One of further problems is to extend the grammatical data heuristically, so as tointensify our machine translation system from learner's level to expert's level.Though our system can translate fair ly complex sentences, i t  s t i l l  commits learn-er's level errors when encountering difficulties such as ambiguity of preposi-tional group modification or of word linking scope for conjunction.
Heuristicaspects of semantics are also our current interests of research.
Especially thecase-grammetical idea \[9\] seems to be useful to refine our syntactic-role assign-ment process so as to improve the quality of generated Japanese sentences.
Akind of semantic ode system (or thesaurus) will also be required to be introducedin our lexicons.
Space limitation of this proceeding does not allow us to des-cribe Our linguistic model: HPM in detail.
We are planning to present he moredetailed version of HPM together with later improvement in some appropriatejournals.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe would like to thank Prof. Nagao of Kyoto University for his kind and stimulativediscussion on various aspects of machine translation.
