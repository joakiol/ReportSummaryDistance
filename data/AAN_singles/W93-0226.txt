Intentions, hffornla,tion, and Inference:Two Rhetorical Questions.Ion ()l)erlander*Centre for Cognitive Science and Human Cominunicatiotl Research Centre,University of Edinburgh1 IntroductionMoore and Pollack \[1992:540\], following Grosz and Sidner \[1986:201\] point to the possibility thatinterpreters can often infer intentional relations fi'om informational relations, and vice versa.
Ioriginally intended to explore the nn.ture of these inferences in the framework of SDRT and DICE,and show how they go through in some cases, but not in o thers )  The details of this modelling turnout to be interesting, 1)ut not wholely surprising.
I will theretbre take the inference-based model forgranted, and pose instea.d two rhetorical qttesl.ions that arose whelL working it out.
The questionsare: first, when is an intentionM relation not a.n intentional r(da.tion?
And secondly, when is aninforinational relation not an ilfforma,tional rela, tion?2 A question of intention(1) Nobody seems to ca.re al)ont any modern poet nowadays except .lohn Betjema,n, whowrites agreeably in praise of buttered toast and railway sta.tions, and bet:ame a best selleralmost By Appointment after Princess Margaret said she liked his verse.

after Princess Margaret said she liked his verse.Which relations hold between the elements of (2)?
If we are interested ill tile domain of time andcausality, the informationM relations are easy enough: the eventuality of (2a,) temporally overlapswith those of both (21)) and (2c); (2b)'s event temporally succeeds (2c)'s, a.nd is caused by it.
Butwhich intentionM relations hohl between thenV, tIn Lascarides and Oberlander \[1993\], we analysed the l)resuppositiomd beha.vi()ur of temporal con-nectives like after, and proposed a. model ill which subordinate cla.us(,s like (2(:) a.re accomntodatedvia discourse attachment.
As usual, various defeasil)le inferences go through, aad the conclusion isthat the following discourse relations hold between the SDR.Ss: Backg,vund(2a., 2c), Narlution(2c,2b), and Result(2c, 2b).
Notice: the inference process delivers not one hut l',,o discourse relationsholding between (21)) and (2c).
So it, seems tha.t we have gone a. step further than Moore andPollack: we not only agree with their Mullih'vrl cla.im; we a,lso go on to make a, Multirchttion cla,im:more than one intentiona.l-level r(,la, ti(m ca.n simulta.neously hohl Imtween l.w(~ discourse segments.In response, one could invent a new discourse relation, Narratiou'n'Rt'.~ull, which wouhl hohl injust these cases.
But its tack of independent motiva.tion, a.nd its resemblance to Knott ~rn(I Dale's\[1992:7\] inform-accidcnt-and-mcntion-fi'uit rela.tion is undermining.
Alteruately, one could arguethat the multiplicity of discourse relations arises because we alrea.dy have too many intentionalrelations, rather than too few.
On this account, we should dipose of (sa.y) Result, and make dowith the intentionM relation Narration, and various informational rela.tions, like cause, to cover thecases.
There is something to be said for this view, but I won't say it here.Rather, I would defend the Multirela.tion cla.im by observing that it is the ua.tural concomita.nt of themultiple intentions erved by single segments of discourse.
We entertain as welt as describe; impressas well as convince.
Grosz and Sidner \[198{i:178\] 1)oint out that the a,ssumption that each segmenthas but one purpose will "in the end prove too strong".
So segments erve multil)le orthogonalgoals; and this means that a. segment ma.y Ih.ll into multiple rela.tionships, (,v(,n with a single othersegment.Thus, it shouhl be no surl)rise tha.t a. discourse sl.ru(:tllre tlmoi'y can (hdiver m.r~, tha.n one intentiona.lrelation holding between two discourse segments.
Indeed, on this stt~ry, it.
is much more surprisingthat some theories do not.3 A. quest ion  of  in fo rmat ion99(4)This may seem to carry the iml)lication that the knowledge ill question is a.cquired withoutobservation.
The fact, if it be a t'a.ct, that I take lol,ger steps left l'oot forward wouhl not\]lave any bearing ()n the ca.t'e with which I might illvestiga.te the ma.tter; l might makemy measurements carelessly and gel; the wrong answer.
But where I intend something itseems to be guaranteed tha.t I couh\[ not get a wrong answer, so it seems as though wenmst know our own intentions independently of obserw~.ti(m. \[LOB G63:96-103\]a.

so it seems as though we must know our own intentions iztdependently of ohservation.Which intentionM rela.tions hold between (41)) a.lM (4c)?
(This datum is a real-liik: version of Mooreand Pollack's Bush example.)
The stra.ight|brwa.rd answer al~l)ea.rs to b(,: (.
'on.~cqu~:ucc(4b, c) andBackyround(4b , 4c) (cf.
Oberlander \[1993\]).
The (.
'on,~cque:ncc relation is an evidential relation, inwhich the first-mentioned seglnent is taken to supply evidence tot the secolM-mentioned seglnent.It's a different relation froln Evidcn, ec, because the direction of evi(h~ntial SUl)port is reversed.Now: suppose that,  like the original Bush example, our Incorrigil~le xample lacked the explicitconnective so.
What  difference would this make?
The a.nswer is: we would lose the clue as to whichof (41)) and (4c) was the directive part (of'.
Elhadad \[1992:204\], who adapting Halli(lay, distinguishesbetween directive and subordinate segments).
Thus, even with exactly the same causal structurebeneath it, the argument could be inverted: we could be mentionillg (4c) to l)rovide evidence for(41)), rather than vice versa..
But 'when wollld th(~ argument be iHverted?
In Grosz ~md Sidner\[1986:201\], there is an equivalence between the intbrmational relati(m supports and the intentionalrel;ttion Dominates.
Under DICE's inference regime, the flip I)etwe(m (,'on.~cquencc and Evidencetracks the flip in the direction of supports.But how can a doma.in rela.tion like supports "change direction"?
We agree that it's "not iml)lica-tion"; but it's not even just defeasiblt: intplication.
It's like implicatioll, in that  it concerns transferof degrees of belief; but unlike most implications, there need 1)e nothing "out there" to make onedirection right, and the other wrong.
A spea.ker and hearer may di\[:l'er as to whether p causes qor vice versa.
Only one of them will he right on each occasion.
But if they dift'er as to whetherp supports q, they can both be right; it just depends on their individual networks of prior beliefs.And if this is so, supports is not an informatio~,a.l---(lomain---rela.tiol.
