THE TRANSFER OP FINITE VERB FORMS IN A MACHINETRANSLATION SYSTEMBente MaegaardInstitut for anvendt og matematlsk lingvlstik,K~benhsvns UniversltetNJalsgade 96, DK-2300 K~benhavn S, De:m~arkThis paper i s  based on work done Jo in t ly  by Hanne Ruus, EhbeSpang-Hanssen and the author, all of the University of Copen~hagen.
The work was done within the framework of EUROTRA andsponsored by the Commission of the European Community.
Workon this paper was begun whilst the author was at ISSCO,Genev a.Throughout this paper we shall imagine a machine trans-lation system which performs the following: correct analysisof source language, correct structure of target language sent-ence, correct choice of words in the target language.
In thisenv i ro~.ent  we sha l l  d i scuss  some aspects  of  the problem ofconst ruc t ing  the cor rec t  f in i te  verba l  form.
The languages in -vo lved are the languages of the European Community.
It isobvious that it is not possible simply to use the "same"morphological form in the target language as in the sourcelanguage: verbal tenses are not the same in all languages(not even in languages as closely related as those considered)and even where the same tenses exist they do not necessarilyhave the same distribution.
So a mapping has to be defined.AS EUROTRA is in its concept ion  multilingual this mappingshould not be defined on a binary basis (between pairs oflanguages), but should rather consist in a definition of somebasic and global interpretations of the morphology of verbs inthe languages considered.- 190  -The study can .not  be res t r i c ted  to morphology proper .Meanings that  are expressed morphologically (by auxiliariesor flexives) in one language might be expressed lexically (bythe use of particular lexical units) in other languages.
As anexample~ take the progressive aspect in English: En.

ils 4crivent / ils @ont en train d'4crire, --~--~ Danish de skTiver / de sidder cg skriver / de er i f~rdwed at ~krlve.l .e.
the progressive aspect which is expressedin English by morphological mesns, is in French and Danisheither not expressed or expressed by certain lexical units.It is very important to realize the impact of this, Thereis often a tendency to think that in the analysis of languagea borderline can be drawn between morphological informationand lexioal information.
This is true to s large extent whenonly one language is considered, but it is certainly not truein a multilingual environment.
Roughly speaking, the systemshould take into account all pieces of information which canbe expressed morphologically in at least one language.The propose~ e.yetem for the representation of verbal forms.The system as such will contain the global information,i.e.
the information which has to be transferred to otherlanguages.
In this paper only the transfer of active finiteverb forms with respect to tense will be considered, i.e.modality, voice, etc.
is not taken into account.Apart from this global information the system can foreach language be expanded with all kinds of local informationwhich is useful for analysis or for generation.
Some morpho-logical phenomena are only grammatically bound and do notcarry any semantic meaning that should be coded for the useof other languages, e.g.
the use of the subjonctif in Frenchsubordinate clauses following ll faut que.
Information aboutthis subjonctif can be regarded as internal to French andshould not be expressed in the global system.The variables proposed to describe the semantic contentof tense and aspect are the following (Note that tens_.._ee is- 191  -used in  a very  genera l  meaning.

Here only a few remarks can be made.1.
The system i s  viewed as operat ing  in  a l l  languages ontwo t ime axes ,  one fo r  the tenses  that  are  anchored in  thepresent ,  and a para l le l  one fo r  the  tenses  that  are  anchoredin  the past  (NUNC and TUNC, respect ive ly ) ,2.
The RETROSPECTIVE value CONTINUOUS is used for eventsthat are still going on: F~.

He has l~.ved there  fo  r" a month w i l l  get  the samevalues: (I~NC, PROSPECT-, CONTINUOUS, null, DURATIVE).3.
More va lues  fo r  the RETROSPECTIVE var iab le  i s  to  beforeseen.4.
In English it is not possible to have the prefect tensewith an adverbial of the type TIMEWHEN.
So a rule of thegeneration ~smmar  of English will say that (~UNC, PROSPECT-,RETRO+ ..,..) + T I~WHEH -~ (TUNC, PROSPECT-, RETRO-,..,..)5.
Certain verbs in English tend to prefer the progressive- 192  -aspect.
Consequently the AKTIONSART must be expanded as to beable to express these facts:A simulation of the system made on some Community textsshows good results.A text is shown in the appednix An French (source) andin English.
Both versions are official Community texts.
Foreach verbal form which is finite in French and has a finiteequivalent in English is shown how the system works.a adopt ~ (NUNC, PROSPECT-, RETRO+, null, NON-DURATIVE) +.

the English version in fact has dropped to, but asthere is no TIMEWHEN this is not possible to obtainwith the system.
However it is possible to chooseboth translations from the French original.Note furthermore, that tombe_.__~r in the meaning "decrease"is DURATIVE, while tomber~a is NON-DURATIVE).To our knowledge no other  system has been proposed whichworks for more than one language.
Reichenbach's system is madefor English and shows deficiences even for English.
Bruce "ssystem repairs these deficiences and works for English, butrelies heavily on the structure of English verbal forms andcannot easily be brought to work for other languages as well.- 193  -The system which we have proposed seems promising, but stilla good deal of work is needed to define adequate values forthe different variables.Reference sBruce: A Model for Temporal References and Its Applicationin a Question Answering Program.

After consulting the ECSO Consultative Committee(Bull.
EC 3-1979, point 2.3.75), on 19 April the Commission ~ the annual report on the Communi~ coal market in 1978 forecasts for 1979 (OJ C 120 of 14.5.1979).At around 287 million tonnes coal consumption was about thesame in 1978 as in 1977, while consumption for-6Tectrlcitygeneration rose by about 58 to reach roughly 159 million t in1978 as oom~-~d with 151 million t the previous year.
Commun-was ity coal production in 1978"I~ma about 238 million t or some18 lower than in 1977, the features being a slight risein production in the UK and slight drops elsewhere.Price increases of Community coal have he qn moderate.
However,as world market prices expressed ih most Community cttrrencleshave been fallin~ because of the weakening of the US dollar,the competitiveness of Community coal has been deterioratin~considerably.
Nevertheless, coal imports from third countries~o bY about 1.5% to 45 million t, of which over half was alo- 195 -
