Proceedings of the First Celtic Language Technology Workshop, pages 60?65,Dublin, Ireland, August 23 2014.gdbank: The beginnings of a corpus of dependency structures andtype-logical grammar in Scottish GaelicColin BatchelorRoyal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK CB4 0WFbatchelorc@rsc.orgAbstractWe present gdbank, a small handbuilt corpus of 32 sentences with dependency structures andcategorial grammar type assignments.
The sentences have been chosen to illustrate as broad arange of the unusual features of Scottish Gaelic as possible, particularly nouns being used torepresent psychological states where more thoroughly-studied languages such as English andFrench would prefer a verb, and prepositions marking aspect, as is also seen in Welsh and, forexample, Irish Gaelic.
We provide hand-built dependency trees, building on previous work onIrish Gaelic and using the Universal Dependency Scheme.
We also provide a tentative categorialgrammar account of the words in the sentences, based largely on previous work on English.1 IntroductionScottish Gaelic (usually hereafter Gaelic) is a Celtic language, rather closely related to Irish, with around59,000 speakers as of the last UK census in 2011.
As opposed to the situation for Irish Gaelic (Lynn etal., 2012a; Lynn et al., 2012b; Lynn et al., 2013; Lynn et al., 2014) there are no treebanks or taggingschemes for Scottish Gaelic, although there are machine-readable dictionaries and databases availablefrom Sabhal M`or Ostaig.
A single paper in the ACL Anthology (Kessler, 1995) mentions Scottish Gaelicin the context of computational dialectology of Irish.
There is also an LREC workshop paper (Scan-nell, 2006) on machine translation between Irish and Scottish Gaelic.
Elsewhere in the Celtic languages,Welsh has an LFG grammar (Mittendorf and Sadler, 2005) but no treebanks.
For Breton there is a smallamount of work on morphological analysis and Constraint-Grammar-based machine translation (Tyers,2010).
Recent work on the grammar of Scottish Gaelic (for example (Adger and Ramchand, 2003; Adgerand Ramchand, 2005), but there are many more examples) has largely focussed on theoretical syntac-tic issues somewhat distant from the more surfacy approaches popular in the field of natural languageprocessing.
This paper explores grammatical issues in Scottish Gaelic by means of dependency taggingand combinatory categorial grammar (CCG), which we see as complementary approaches.
As such itis explicitly inspired by CCGbank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007), which consists of dependencystructures and CCG derivations for over 99% of the Penn Treebank.
It is hoped that this corpus will bea useful adjunct to currently on-going work in developing a part-of-speech tagset and tagger for ScottishGaelic.Section 2 describes how the corpus was prepared, sections 3 and 4 give some context for the depen-dency scheme and categorial grammar annotations respectively, and the main part of the paper is section5, which deals with language-specific features of the corpus.2 Preparing the corpusThe corpus consists of a small handbuilt selection of sentences from the transcripts of An Litir Bheag,which is a weekly podcast from the BBC written by a native speaker and aimed at Gaelic learners,example sentences from (Lamb, 2003), the BBC?s online news in Gaelic and the Gaelic column in theScotsman newspaper.

(2) Strings connected by a hyphen, for example h-Alba in Banca na h-Alba(Bank of Scotland) or t-`Oban as in an t-`Oban (the town of Oban) are always kept together.
(3) Theapostrophe is kept together with the copula where it proceeds it, for example in ?S fhearr leam (I like).
(4) Because the past tense particle do is reduced to dh?
before a vowel and before f, and this is alwaystypographically closed up, we separate out past-tense dh?
as its own token.
These rules work for thesmall dataset described here but would clearly need to be expanded for work in the wild.In this preliminary work the dependencies and types have been determined by a single, non-nativespeaker, annotator, according to a set of guidelines which were built up during the annotation process.This is clearly less than ideal, however, the guidelines are available along with the corpus and we hopeto be able to get the input of a native speaker, not least for interannotator studies.We use the CoNLL-X format (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006), leaving the POS and projective dependencyfields empty and store the categorial grammar type under field 6, FEATS.3 Dependency schemeThere are four dependency schemes that we consulted while preparing the corpus.
The initial inspirationwas provided by the C&C parser (Curran et al., 2007), which in addition to providing categorial gram-mar derivations for sentences provides a dependency structure in the GR (Grammatical Representation)scheme due to (Briscoe and Carroll, 2000; Briscoe and Carroll, 2002).
This contains 23 types and wasdeveloped originally for parser evaluation.
Another popular scheme is the Stanford Dependency scheme(de Marneffe and Manning, 2008; de Marneffe and Manning, 2013), which is more finely-grained withover twice the number of dependency types to deal specifically with noisy data and to make it moreaccessible to non-linguists building information extraction applications.
A very important scheme is theDublin scheme for Irish (Lynn et al., 2012a; Lynn et al., 2012b; Lynn et al., 2013), which is of a similarsize to the Stanford scheme, but the reason for its size relative to GR is that it includes a large num-ber of dependencies intended to handle grammatical features found in Irish but not in English.
Lastlywe mention the Universal Dependency Scheme developed in (McDonald et al., 2013), which we haveadopted, despite its being coarser-grained than the Dublin scheme, on account of its simplicity and utilityfor cross-lingual comparisons and cross-training (Lynn et al., 2014).Table 1 gives examples of the dependency relations used along with their mapping to the GR scheme.4 Categorial grammarCombinatory categorial grammar (CCG) is a type-logical system which was developed to represent nat-ural languages such as English but has subsequently been extended to other systems such as chord se-61quences in jazz (Granroth-Wilding and Steedman, 2012).
For a full description the reader is referred to(Steedman and Baldridge, 2003), but in order to follow the rest of this paper you merely need to knowthat the type N/N is a function which takes an argument of N to its right, returning N, and that the typeN\N is a function expecting an argument of N to its left and that these are combined by application,composition, where A/B combines with B/C to yield A/C, and type-raising where N is converted toT/(N\T).
Attractive features of CCG for modelling a less-well-studied language include that it is a lex-ical theory in which it is the lexicon contains the rules for how words are combined to make sense ratherthan an external grammar, that it allows all manner of unconventional constituents, which is particularlypowerful for parsing coordinated structures in English, that it is equivalent to a weakly context-sensitivegrammar and hence has the power of a real natural language.
In Steedman and Baldridge (2003) there areexamples of the application of multimodal CCG to Irish Gaelic.
However, to the best of our knowledgethis paper is the first application of CCG to Scottish Gaelic.In gdbank, there is a single hand-built CCG derivation for every sentence.
The notation is based on thatin CCGbank with a small number of adaptations for Gaelic (see next section).
The basic units that can beassembled into types are S (clauses), N (nouns), conj (conjugations), and PP (prepositional phrases).For subcategorization purposes and to help keep things clear for the annotator and the reader we markprepositional phrases with the dictionary form of the preposition.We have not yet investigated overgeneration and ungrammatical sentences, hence there is only onekind of modality in gdbank; however restricting the way words can combine to the way in which theyactually do combine in Gaelic is an obvious and essential next step.5 Language-specific featuresPrepositional phrases in Gaelic are often single-word, fused preposition?pronouns, a part-of-speechfound across the Celtic languages.
An ambiguous case of this is the token ris, which can be either ri withthe pronoun e, hence taking the CCG type PP[ri], or the pre-determiner form of ri, hence PP[ri]/N[b].The other class of fused preposition?pronoun we need to consider is that in sentences like Tha mi gadchluinntinn, ?I can hear you?, where gad is ag fused with do ?your?.
In this case it has type PP[ag]/S[n].Adjectives as in CCGbank are treated as clauses, S[adj].
The verbal noun is labelled S[n] by analogywith Hockenmaier and Steedman (2007).
In addition to declarative and interrogative clauses, S[dcl]and S[q], we take our lead from the fourfold division of preverbal particles and add negative clausesS[neg], usually introduced by cha or chan, and negative interrogative clauses, S[negq], introducedby nach.There are two verbs for ?to be?
in Scottish Gaelic, bi and is.
Bi is used for predicate statementsabout nouns, to forming the present tense and to describe some psychological states.
It does not usuallyequate two NPs, with an exception we will come to.
In the Dublin scheme the prepositional phraseheaded by ag in T?a s?e ag iascaireacht (?He is fishing.?)
is treated as being an externally-controlledcomplement of T?a (Gaelic tha) and we carry this analysis over into Scottish Gaelic where this is themost common way of expressing the present tense.
Figure 1 demonstrates this, where dhachaigh is anon-clausal modifier of dol, the verbal noun for ?to go?.
Is can be used as the copula between two NPs,and to express psychological states such as liking and preference.
To say ?I am a teacher?, the Gaelicis ?S e tidsear a th?
annam.
This, at least on the surface, equates pronoun e, with a noun described by arelative clause including the verb bi.
Fig.
1 shows our dependency tree for this.
Note that this is differentfrom the scheme in Lynn et al.
(2012b) because of a difference between the two languages.
They treatthe analogous sentence Is tusa an m?uinteoir ?You are the teacher?
as having a subject, ?the teacher?, anda clausal predicate, tusa, ?you indeed?.The most straightforward way of expressing a preference is the assertive is followed by an adjectiveor noun, a PP marking the preferrer, and then the object.
If you dislike music, you might say Is beag ormce`ol.
There are exactly analogous constructions in Irish with is + adjective + PP[le] + object, for exampleIs maith liom... ?I like...?, which in (U??
Dhonnchadha, 2009) is treated as having the prepositionalphrase as the subject and the adjective as predicate.
We modify this to use adpmod as in the UniversalDependency Scheme as shown in Fig.

To the best of our knowledge this represents the first attempt tohandle a range of real-life Scottish Gaelic sentences in such a way.
gdbank itself and the guidelinesused to build it are available from https://code.google.com/p/gdbank/ and we welcomefeedback.
We have of course only been able to illustrate a small number of constructions.
Tables 2 and3 list counts for the categorial types and dependency relations used.
In 32 sentences there are a total of406 tokens.We have not yet on the other hand attempted to deal with the morphology of Scottish Gaelic, forexample lenition and slenderization, beyond drawing the attention of the human annotator to these phe-nomena when they may affect the correct parsing of a sentence.
Clearly for automated natural-languageprocessing of Gaelic these will need to be treated programmatically.
We also disregard case and gender,although we expect that these will be dealt with as part of a rather more ambitious project, that of theLamb group at the University of Edinburgh to build a part-of-speech tagset and tagged corpus which welook forward to seeing.AcknowledgementsThe anonymous referees for their very constructive comments.Relation Count Relation Count Relation Countadpmod 58 mark 23 amod 11nsubj 47 nmod 18 advmod 9adpobj 38 ccomp 17 acomp 7det 34 prt 14 cc 6p 33 dobj 13 rcmod 4ROOT 32 xcomp 13 appos 2Table 3: Counts for dependency relations in gdbank.
