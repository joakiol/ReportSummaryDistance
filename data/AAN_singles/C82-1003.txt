The propertranslat ion rules for  funct ions and objects sure appl ied with re fe -rence te arguments of a p red loate .~ la t ion  ~ les  for  Pol ish lan-guage have been reported in  \[I\] as wel l  as their a~pl icat ion to al laxioms descr lb in~ FORTRAN.DIRECTED GRAPH AS A D~rHOD OF INSTRUCTIONAL STRUCTURE REPRESENTATIONAn assumpt ion is done that al l  knowledge to be tau6ht can be dividedto instruct ional  units.Thus the f irst step to oonstr~ot an instruc-t ional structure representat ion is to select such units /concepts/.Each of them has a name and at  least one sentence can be told aboutit /unreal  concepts are not a l lowed/ .Some introductory concepts areassumed to  be known to  the student.The next step is to specify al l  relat ions between concepts.These re-lations could be:/a /  Concept X is a part of Y,/b/  Concept X has a property~ represented by Z~~ oncept X is a reason Or  a Just i f icat ion of T,Concept X belongs to the object class represented by K,/e /  Concept X is an alternat ive of A~/ f /  Concept X is equivalent to W at least in  some circumstances.Each re lat ion corresponds with a graph, which nodes represent con-cepts from an introduced set of concepts.The composit ion of al l  ob-tained 6~aphs rerults in  a f inal  graph~whlch represents an instruc-t ional structure of the subject matter .Because of the di f ferent in-terpretat ion of the part icular  arches of this ~Taph /which are de-scr ibed by various re lat ionships/  the "superior- infer ior" re lat ionis introduced as the universal  one which represents every re lat ionbetween concepts.Thus the dlrested ~phhas  been obtained,~ith ar-rows directed to the super ior  concepts.A set of axioms is associated with each node of the concept graph.Also some other in format ion may be associated with it.ANSWERING STUDENT'S QUESTIONSThe fo l lowin~ problems have to be solved|- choice and specify in~ of classes of user 's  quer ies,which canbe answered by the ICAI system~- reco@~nition of a main  subject of the query,t ranslat ion of the query f rom natural  language to the predicatecalculus language fo rmula ,- appl icat ion of the automated theorem-provin~ techniques to re-tr ieve an answer,- generat in~ of an answer in natura~ language form.Three classes of queries have been qonsidered:/ I /  Dec is ion queries of gener~l \ form in natural  language<interrogative particle> < sentence> 7where: <interrogative part io le>/exist in~ in Pol ish/  deter-mines that a quest ion belongs to this class 9~entenoe> - indicat ive sentence,KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION lVlETHOD IN AN ICAI SYSTEM 17which require an answer in the form .Y~s, or "No"./2/  Object ive quez-lee of ~enez~al foz~ in  natuz~l lansuageWhloh ~senex~l name> <predloate~ ?whloh require to re t r ieve  an  object posessi~E some glvenfeatures as an answer.The quez 7 of this class may be tz~nsformed into the formlWhich X satisf ies a oo~Litlon: W (X) ~ A ~) ?whePez Y - an  ob jec t  to  be foundpW ~ - d i s t inc t ive  pred icate  o f  a set~ wh ich  i s  spe-c i f i ed  by  ~genez~L1 name> in  the  query ,A(X) - .

It is worth not lo ln~ that:- querles in  the natural  lar~ua~e ?orm have the threefold nature~it means they can be counted into the three ment ioned above olasses~- queries fragments in  the form of indicat ive clauses are bui ltf rom expressed in natural  language p~edloates~introduee~ in the pre-sent ed f or~alization~- in respect of quantity of expressions the language of user'squeries is comparable wi th  the laa1&~e obtained in  the process oftranslat ion of p~ed/oate calculus axioms into natural  lan~ua~e~- lan@uaGe o~ user's queries and the predloate calculus l~a~ehave a common base of basle concepts because the sorts of ob~eots~functions and pFedicates introduced in the predloate calculus lan-guage correspond with some specif ied natural  language expressions.It has been submitted that quest lon-answering problem m~y be  solvedwith an appl icat ion o~ auto~te~ theorem-pyo~,in~ teohnlques~ namelyon the base o\[ the resolut ion principle \[8\] ,This method~ based onlyon the s~rnteac o f  olauses~ doesn't require to control the proo~ pro-cedure by the user,The resolut ion prlnelple requires to convert al lformulas into the Skolem conjunctive form.
Thus each formula beco-mes a set of olauses~ each of them bei~E a d ls junot ion of l iterals,The quest ion-ans~ering procedure for  deols lon queries tries to pro-~e that a negat ion of formula ~ ob%alned after  translat ion of the qu-e r~ is false, I?
it 's so~ an answer is "Yes".
If a proo~ procedureappl ied to  the formula in  its a~firmati~/e ~or~ provides a sucoess~an answer is "NO".Some questions may be unsolvable in  the lack ofkno~le~e.The proof procedure ?or  objective queries examines a ?ormula~~x (w (x} ~ A (x))18 B. BEGIERwhich is supposed to be fa lse.The proof prroedure tries to retr ievea counter-example, if i% exists, which wi l l  be subst i tuted in theplace of X oI% has been assumed that problem queries are in the impl icat ion formafter the translat ion proeess.
Quest ion-answerin~ procedure for  thisclass of queries has been reduced to such onetwhich tries to retr ie-ve an answer f rom one axiom.
For the f i rst  subclass of problem que-ries a search is made for  an axiom in the impl icat ion form, ~hichconclusion embodies the conclusion of the formula obtained f rom thetx~ansformed query.
The premises of this axiom are an answer?
Theproof procedure appl ied to answer a quest ion of the second subclasstries to f ind an axiom~ which premises are impl ied by premises ofthe formula obtained f~om the transformed query.
The conclus ion ofthis axiom is an answer.The proper way to reduce a number  of clauses taking a part in theresolut ion process is to constr,~ct an init ia l  act ive set of clausesas a set containing only clauses of axioms concerning concepts reco-~LIzed in the query and clauses of formula obtained f rom the query.The translat ion rules,appl ied to transform axioms f rom the predica-te calculus language into the natural  language expressions t can beused also to translate the retr ieved answer to the natural  language?CONCLUSIONSDescr ibed above ~1o~le~e representat iom method based on predicatecalculus has been appl ied to the large subset of FORTRAN 1900 \[I\] .I% has been sho~n that this method satisf ies cr i ter ia required inthe ICAI system.
An appl icat ion of the predicate calculus languageto descr ibe knowledge about the programming language provides theautomated answering of student's quest ions,whlch is the main  advan-tage of this method.T~Lis method is appl icable to those domains of ~owledge ,  which canbe represented by the set of f irst or~er logic axioms, wi th  regardto their formal ized nature.REFERENCES\[J\] Begier  B.
