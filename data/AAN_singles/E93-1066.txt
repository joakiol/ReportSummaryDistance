Thedescription has been implemented using the PC-KIMMO environment (Antworth, 1990) and is basedon a root word lexicon of about 23,000 roots words.Almost all the special cases of and exceptions tophonological and morphological rules have been im-plemented.Turkish is an agglutinative language with wordstructures formed by productive affixations of deriva-tional and inflectional suffixes to root words.
Turkishhas finite-state but nevertheless rather complex mor-photactics.
Morphemes added to a root word or astem can convert he word from a nominal to a ver-bal structure or vice-versa, or can create adverbialconstructs.
The surface realizations of morphologi-cal constructions are constrained and modified by anumber of phonetic rules such as vowel harmony.2 Two-level description of TurkishmorphologyThe phonetic rules of contemporary Turkish havebeen encoded using 22 two-level rules while the mor-photactics of the agglutinative word structures hasbeen encoded as finite-state machines for verbal,nominal paradigms.
Our lexicons are based on thecomprehensive word list that we have compiled forour spelling checker developed earlier (Solak andOflazer, 1992).
We have lexicons for nouns, ad-jectives verbs, compound nouns, proper nouns, pro-nouns, adverbs, connectives, exclamations, postposi-tions, acronyms, technical words, special cases, Thereare total of 18,500 nominal (nouns + adjectives)roots and about 2,450 verbal roots.
There are about100 lexicons for suffixes.3 Example OutputHere we provide a sample output from our imple-mentation (slightly edited for proper orthography):InputMorpheme Struct.cah~manmcah~-I-mA+Hn+nHn~:a h,~-I-mA-I-nH nG lOSSEnglish meaningV(?ah~)+VtoN(ma)+2PS-POS+GENot your =ork(mg)V(?aI,~)-t-VtoN(ma)+GENo/the work(ing)N(?ocuk)+3PS-POShis/her child~OCU~U~ocuk+sH?ocuk+yHahnml~al+Hn+ymH~al+nHn+ymH,~al$m+ymH~al-t-Hn-l-mH~al-I-Hn-l-mH~ahn-t-mH~ahn-l-mH~boynuboy$un+sHboy$un+yHN(?ocuk)+ACCchild (accusative)N(al)+2PS-POS-I-NtoVO-I-NARR+3PS(it) was your red (one)N(al)+GEN+NtoVO+NARR+3PS(it) belongs to the red (one)N(al,n)+NtoVO+NARR+3PS(it) was a foreheadV(al)+PASS+VtoAdj(mis)(a) taken (object)V(al)+PASS+NARR+3PSit was takenV(ahn)+VtoAdj(mis)Can) offended (person)V(ahn)+NARR+3PSs/he was offendedN(boyun)+3PS-POS(his/her) neckN(boyun)+ACCneck (accusative)4 ConclusionsThis poster has presented a summary of the firstfull scale implementation f two-level description ofTurkish morphology.
We have been using this de-scription as a morphological parsing module in anumber of applications like LFG parsing, ATN pars-ing and semantics analysis of Turkish sentences.References\[Antworth, 1990\] Evan L. Antworth.
