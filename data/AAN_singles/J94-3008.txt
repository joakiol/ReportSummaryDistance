Commentary  on Dae lemans ,  Gil l is, and Dur ieuxPrahlad Gupta 1(Carnegie Mellon University)The article by Daelemans et al bears on an important question about the adequacy ofthe "Principles and Parameters" framework as the basis of a process account of languagelearning (exemplified, for instance, by the work of Dresher and Kaye 1990).
As Guptaand Touretzky (1991, 1994) have pointed out, a learning system based on a particularlinguistic description (of metrical phenomena, for example) can at best learn whateveris describable within that linguistic formalism; however, important aspects of real-world stress data do not appear amenable to parameter-based description, and aretherefore unlearnable for a parameter-based system.In the present work, the authors make a careful examination of main stress as-signment in Dutch, showing that the consensus (parameterized) linguistic analysis forDutch yields correct stress for only 81.1% of the words in a representative corpus.
Theproblem is that when words are represented only by their syllable weights (as requiredby metrical theory), they can be ambiguous with respect o stress assignment.A parameter-based procedure therefore can at best learn only the "regular" 81.1%of the data.
By assuming certain lexically specified exception markings, the frameworkcan be extended to allow characterization of a further 16% of the data; however,the analysis then loses its principled, parameterized form.
Furthermore, it offers noaccount of how these "irregular" data could be learned, except by rote.The authors contrast his with results they obtained using instance-based l arning(IBL); their system was trained on 90% of the corpus and tested on the other 10%.With an input representation e coding only syllable weight, IBL performed at 81.26%correct, which consisted of all the regulars but none of the irregulars, mirroring thedescriptive adequacy of the linguistic formalism based on the same representation.When the input representation encoded phonemic information (instead of syllableweight), IBL performed at 88% correct, which included most of the regulars and asubstantial proportion of the irregulars.
Rote learning would have to be invoked forthe remaining 12% of the data.
However, this is probably about the best that can bedone given the idiosyncracies of Dutch stress, and it is substantially less than the20% rote learning required in the linguistic scheme.
The difference lies in the use ofphonemic information.Choosing between these schemes i largely a matter of preference, and the authors'results do not rule out the linguistic alternative.
Rather, the importance of their worklies, first, in highlighting the inadequacy ofa parameter-based framework for characterizingand learning Dutch stress assignment, and second, in its demonstration of the utilityof phonemic information in learning about stress.
Both these results deserve to be takenseriously by metrical phonologists.ReferencesDresher, B. E., and Kaye, J. D. (1990).
