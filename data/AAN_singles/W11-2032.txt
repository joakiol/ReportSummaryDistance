In this paper, we eval-uate how native speakers of American Englishand Arabic perceive personality traits and nat-uralness of English utterances that vary alongthe dimensions of verbosity, hedging, lexicaland syntactic alignment, and formality.
Theutterances are the turns within dialogue frag-ments that are presented as text transcripts tothe workers of Amazon?s Mechanical Turk.The results of the study suggest that all four di-mensions can be used as linguistic markers ofall personality traits by both language commu-nities.
A further comparative analysis showscross-cultural differences for some combina-tions of measures of personality traits and nat-uralness, the dimensions of linguistic variabil-ity and dialogue acts.1 IntroductionEnglish has been used as a lingua franca across theworld, but the usage differs.
The variabilities in En-glish introduced by dialects, cultures, and non-nativespeakers result in different syntax and words ex-pressing similar meanings and in different meaningsattributed to similar expressions.
These differencesare a source of pragmatic failures (Thomas, 1983):situations when listeners perceive meanings and af-fective attitudes unintended by speakers.
For exam-ple, Thomas (1984) reports that usage of Illocution-ary Force Indicating Devices (IFIDs, such as ?I warnyou?, (Searle, 1969)) in English by native speak-ers of Russian causes the speakers to sometimesappear ?inappropriately domineering in interactionswith English-speaking equals.?
Dialogue systems,just like humans, may misattribute attitudes and mis-interpret intent of user?s utterances.
Conversely, theymay also cause misattributions and misinterpreta-tions on the user?s part.
Hence, taking into accountthe user?s dialect, culture, or native language mayhelp reduce pragmatic failures.This kind of adaptation requires a mapping fromutterances, or more generally, their linguistic fea-tures, to meanings and affective attributions for eachof the target language communities.
In this paperwe present an exploratory study that evaluates sucha mapping from the linguistic features of verbosity,hedging, alignment, and formality (as defined inSection 3.1) to the perceived personality traits andnaturalness across the populations of native speak-ers of American English and Arabic.Estimating the relationship between linguisticfeatures and their perception across language com-munities faces a number of methodological difficul-ties.
First, language communities shall be outlined,in a way that will afford generalizing within theirpopulations.
Defining language communities is ahard problem, even if it is based on the ?mothertongue?
(McPherson et al, 2000).
Next, linguisticfeatures that are potentially important for the adap-tation must be selected.
These are, for example,the linguistic devices that contribute to realization ofrich points (Agar, 1994), i.e.
the behaviors that sig-nal differences between language communities.
Tobe useful for dialogue system research, the selectedlinguistic features should be feasible to implement innatural language generation and interpretation mod-286ules.
Then, a corpus of stimuli that span the variabil-ity of the linguistic features must be created.
Thestimuli should reflect the context where the dialoguesystem is intended to be used.
For example, in caseof an information-giving dialogue system, the stim-uli should include some question-answer adjacencypairs (Schegloff and Sacks, 1973).
Finally, scalesshould be chosen to allow for scoring of the stimuliwith respect to the metrics of interest.
These scalesshould be robust to be applied within each of the lan-guage communities.In the remainder of this paper, we describe each ofthese steps in the context of an exploratory study thatevaluates perception of English utterances by nativespeakers of American English and Arabic.
Our ap-plication is an information-giving dialogue systemthat is used by the robot receptionists (roboception-ists) in Qatar and the United States (Makatchev etal., 2009; Makatchev et al, 2010).
In the next sec-tion, we continue with an overview of the relatedwork.
Section 3 introduces the experiment, includ-ing the selection of stimuli, measures, design, anddescribes the recruitment of participants via Ama-zon?s Mechanical Turk (MTurk).
We discuss resultsin Section 4 and provide a conclusion in Section 5.2 Related work2.1 Cross-cultural variability in EnglishLanguage is tightly connected with culture (Agar,1994).
As a result, even native speakers of a lan-guage use it differently across dialects (e.g.
AfricanAmerican Vernacular English and Standard Amer-ican English), genders (see, for example, (Lakoff,1973)) and social statuses (e.g.
(Huspek, 1989)),among other dimensions.Speakers of English as a second language displayvariabilities in language use that are consistent withtheir native languages and backgrounds.
For exam-ple, Nelson et al (1996) reports that Syrian speakersof Arabic tend to use different compliment responsestrategies as compared with Americans.
Aguilar(1998) reviews types of pragmatic failures that areinfluenced by native language and culture.
In partic-ular, he cites Davies (1987) on a pragmatic failuredue to non-equivalence of formulas: native speakersof Moroccan Arabic use a spoken formulaic expres-sion to wish a sick person quick recovery, whereas inEnglish the formula ?get well soon?
is not generallyused in speech.
Feghali (1997) reviews features ofArabic communicative style, including indirectness(concealment of wants, needs or goals (Gudykunstand Ting-Toomey, 1988)), elaborateness (rich andexpressive language use, e.g.
involving rhetoricalpatterns of exaggeration and assertion (Patai, 1983))and affectiveness (i.e.
?intuitive-affective style ofemotional appeal?
(Glenn et al, 1977), related tothe patterns of organization and presentation of ar-guments).In this paper, we are concerned with English us-age by native speakers of American English and na-tive speakers of Arabic.
We have used the featuresof the Arabic communicative style outlined aboveas a guide in selecting the dimensions of linguisticvariability that are presented in Section 3.1.2.2 Measuring pragmatic variationPerception of pragmatic variation of spoken lan-guage and text has been shown to vary acrosscultures along the dimensions of personality(e.g.
(Scherer, 1972)), emotion (e.g.
(Burkhardt etal., 2006)), deception (e.g.
(Bond et al, 1990)),among others.
Within a culture, personality traitssuch as extraversion, have been shown to haveconsistent markers in language (see overview in(Mairesse et al, 2007)).
For example, Furnham(1990) notes that in conversation, extraverts are lessformal and use more verbs, adverbs and pronouns.However, the authors are not aware of any quantita-tive studies that compare linguistic markers of per-sonality across cultures.
The present study aims tohelp fill this gap.A mapping between linguistic dimensions andpersonality has been evaluated by grading es-says and conversation extracts (Mairesse et al,2007), and by grading utterances generated automat-ically with a random setting of linguistic parame-ters (Mairesse and Walker, 2008).
In the exploratorystudy presented in this paper, we ask our participantsto grade dialogue fragments that were manually cre-ated to vary along each of the four linguistic dimen-sions (see Section 3.1).2873 ExperimentIn the review of related work, we presented some ev-idence supporting the claim that linguistic markersof personality may differ across cultures.
In this sec-tion, we describe a study that evaluates perceptionof personality traits and naturalness of utterances bynative speakers of American English and Arabic.3.1 StimuliThe selection of stimuli attempts to satisfy three ob-jectives.
First, our application: our dialogue systemis intended to be used on a robot receptionist.
Hence,the stimuli are snippets of dialogue that include fourdialogue acts that are typical in this kind of em-bodied information-giving dialogue (Makatchev etal., 2009): a greeting, a question-answer pair, a dis-agreement (with the user?s guess of an answer), andan apology (for the robot not knowing the answer tothe question).Second, we would like to vary our stimuli alongthe linguistic dimensions that are potentially strongindicators of personality traits.
Extraverts, for exam-ple, are reported to be more verbose (use more wordsper utterances and more dialogue turns to achievethe same communicative goal), less formal (Furn-ham, 1990) (in choice of address terms, for exam-ple), and less likely to hedge (use expressions suchas ?perhaps?
and ?maybe?)
(Nass et al, 1995).
Lex-ical and syntactic alignment, namely, the tendencyof a speaker to use the same lexical and syntacticchoices as their interlocutor, is considered, at leastin part, to reflect the speaker?s co-operation and will-ingness to adopt the interlocutor?s perspective (Hay-wood et al, 2003).
There is some evidence that thedegree of alignment is associated with personalitytraits of the speakers (Gill et al, 2004).Third, we would like to select linguistic dimen-sions that potentially expose cross-cultural differ-ences in perception of personality and naturalness.In particular, we are interested in the linguistic de-vices that help realize rich points (the behaviors thatsignal differences) between the native speakers ofAmerican English and Arabic.
We choose to real-ize indirectness and elaborateness, characteristic ofArabic spoken language (Feghali, 1997), by vary-ing the dimensions of verbosity and hedging.
Highpower distance, or influence of relative social statuson the language (Feghali, 1997), can be realized bythe degrees of formality and alignment.In summary, the stimuli are dialogue fragmentswhere utterances of one of the interlocutors varyacross (1) dialogue acts: a greeting, question-answerpair, disagreement, apology, and (2) four linguisticdimensions: verbosity, hedging, alignment, and for-mality.
Each of the linguistic dimensions is parame-terized by 3 values of valence: negative, neutral andpositive.
Within each of the four dialogue acts, stim-uli corresponding to the neutral valences are repre-sented by the same dialogue across all four linguisticdimensions.
The four linguistic dimensions are real-ized as follows:?
Verbosity is realized as number of words withineach turn of the dialogue.
In the case of thegreeting, positive verbosity is realized by in-creased number of dialogue turns.1?
Positive valence of hedging implies more ten-tative words (?maybe,?
?perhaps,?
etc.)
or ex-pressions of uncertainty (?I think,?
?if I amnot mistaken?).
Conversely, negative valenceof hedging is realized via words ?sure,?
?defi-nitely,?
etc.?
Positive valence of alignment corresponds topreference towards the lexical and syntacticchoices of the interlocutor.
Conversely, neg-ative alignment implies less overlap in lexicaland syntactic choices between the interlocu-tors.?
Our model of formality deploys the follow-ing linguistic devices: in-group identity mark-ers that target positive face (Brown and Levin-son, 1987) such as address forms, jargon andslang, and deference markers that target nega-tive face, such as ?kindly?, terms of address,hedges.
These devices are used in Arabic po-liteness phenomena (Farahat, 2009), and thereis an evidence of their pragmatic transfer fromArabic to English (e.g.
(Bardovi-Harlig et al,2007) and (Ghawi, 1993)).
The set of stimulithat vary along the formality are presented inTable 2.Each dialogue fragment is presented as a text on1The multi-stage greeting dialogue was developed viaethnographic studies conducted at Alelo by Dr. SuzanneWertheim.

On each page, the partici-pant is asked to imagine that he or she is one of theinterlocutors and the other interlocutor is describedas ?a female receptionist in her early 20s and ofthe same ethnic background?
as that of the partici-pant.
The description of the occupation, age, genderand ethnicity of the interlocutor whose utterancesthe participant is asked to evaluate should provideminimal context and help avoid variability due to theimplicit assumptions that subjects may make.3.2 MeasuresIn order to avoid a possible interference of scales,we ran two versions of the study in parallel.
Inone version, participants were asked to evaluate thereceptionist?s utterances with respect to measuresof the Big Five personality traits (John and Srivas-tava, 1999), namely the traits of extraversion, agree-ableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, andopenness, using the ten-item personality question-naire (TIPI, see (Gosling et al, 2003)).
In the otherversion, participants were asked to evaluate the re-ceptionist?s utterances with respect to their natu-ralness on a 7-point Likert scale by answering thequestion ?Do you agree that the receptionist?s utter-ances were natural??
The variants of such a natural-ness scale were used by Burkhardt et al (2006) andMairesse and Walker (2008).3.3 Experimental designThe experiment used a crossed design with the fol-lowing factors: dimensions of linguistic variability(verbosity, hedging, alignment, or formality), va-lence (negative, neutral, or positive), dialogue acts(greeting, question-answer, disagreement, or apol-ogy), native language (American English or Arabic)and gender (male or female).In an attempt to balance the workload of the par-ticipants, depending on whether the participant wasassigned to the study that used personality or nat-uralness scales, the experimental sessions consistedof one or two linguistic variability conditions?12or 24 dialogues respectively.
Hence valence and dia-logue act were within-subject factors, while linguis-tic variability dimension were treated as an across-subject factor, as well as native language and gen-der.
Within each session the items were presented inLanguage Country NArabic Algeria 1Bahrain 1Egypt 56Jordan 32Morocco 45Palestinian Territory 1Qatar 1Saudi Arabia 5United Arab Emirates 13Total 155American English United States 166Table 1: Distribution of study participants by country.a random order to minimize possible carryover ef-fects.3.4 ParticipantsWe used Amazon?s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to re-cruit native speakers of American English from theUnited States and native speakers of Arabic fromany of the set of predominantly Arabic-speakingcountries (according to the IP address).Upon completion of each task, participants re-ceive monetary reward as a credit to their MTurk ac-count.
Special measures were taken to prevent mul-tiple participation of one person in the same studycondition: the study website access would be re-fused for such a user based on the IP address, andMTurk logs were checked for repeated MTurk usernames to detect logging into the same MTurk ac-count from different IP addresses.
Hidden questionswere planted within the study to verify the fluencyin the participant?s reported native language.The distribution of the participants across coun-tries is shown in Table 1.
We observed a regionalgender bias similar to the one reported by Ross et al(2010): there were 100 male and 55 female partici-pants in the Arabic condition, and 63 male and 103female participants in the American English condi-tion.4 ResultsWe analyzed the data by fitting linear mixed-effects(LME) models (Pinheiro and Bates, 2000) and per-forming model selection using ANOVA.
The com-parison of models fitted to explain the personality289and naturalness scores (controlling for language andgender), shows significant main effects of valenceand dialogue acts for all pairs of personality traits(and naturalness) and linguistic features.
The resultsalso show that for every personality trait (and nat-uralness) there is a linguistic feature that results ina significant three-way interaction between its va-lence, the native language, and the dialogue act.These results suggest that (a) for both language com-munities, every linguistic dimension is associatedwith every personality trait and naturalness, for atleast some of the dialogue acts, (b) there are differ-ences in the perception of every personality trait andnaturalness between the two language communities.To further explore the latter finding, we conducteda post-hoc analysis consisting of paired t-tests thatwere performed pairwise between the three values ofvalence for each combination of language, linguis-tic feature, and personality trait (and naturalness).Note, that comparing raw scores between the lan-guage conditions would be prone to find spuriousdifferences due to potential culture-specific tenden-cies in scoring on the Likert scale: (a) perceptionof magnitudes and (b) appropriateness of the inten-sity of agreeing or disagreeing.
Instead, we comparethe language conditions with respect to (a) the rela-tive order of the three valences and (b) the binarizedscores, namely whether the score is above 4 or be-low 4 (with scores that are not significantly differentfrom 4 excluded from comparison), where 4 is theneutral point of the 7-point Likert scale.The selected results of the post-hoc analysis areshown in Figure 1.
The most prominent cross-cultural differences were found in the scoring ofnaturalness across the valences of the formality di-mension.
Speakers of American English, unlike thespeakers of Arabic, find formal utterances unnatu-ral in greetings, question-answer and disagreementdialogue acts.
Formal utterances tend to also beperceived as indicators of openness (omitted fromthe plot) and conscientiousness by Arabic speakers,and not by American English speakers, in disagree-ments and apologies respectively.
Finally, hedgingin apologies is perceived as an indicator of agree-ableness by American English speakers, but not byspeakers of Arabic.Interestingly, no qualitative differences acrosslanguage conditions were found in the perceptionof extraversion and stability.
It is possible that thiscross-cultural consistency confirms the view of theextraversion, in particular, as one of most consis-tently identified dimensions (see, for example, (Gilland Oberlander, 2002)).
It could also be possi-ble that our stimuli were unable to pinpoint theextraversion-related rich points due to a choice ofthe linguistic dimensions or particular wording cho-sen. A larger variety of stimuli per condition, and anethnography to identify potentially culture-specificlinguistic devices of extraversion, could shed thelight on this issue.5 ConclusionWe presented an exploratory study to evaluate a setof linguistic markers of Big Five personality traitsand naturalness across two language communities:native speakers of American English living in theUS, and native speakers of Arabic living in oneof the predominantly Arabic-speaking countries ofNorth Africa and Middle East.
The results suggestthat the four dimensions of linguistic variability arerecognized as markers of all five personality traits byboth language communities.
A comparison acrosslanguage communities uncovered some qualitativedifferences in the perception of openness, conscien-tiousness, agreeableness, and naturalness.The results of the study can be used to adapt nat-ural language generation and interpretation to nativespeakers of American English or Arabic.
This ex-ploratory study also supports the feasibility of thecrowdsourcing approach to validate the linguisticdevices that realize rich points?behaviors that sig-nal differences across languages and cultures.Future work shall evaluate effects of regional di-alects and address the issue of particular wordingchoices by using multiple stimuli per condition.AcknowledgmentsThis publication was made possible by the supportof an NPRP grant from the Qatar National ResearchFund.
