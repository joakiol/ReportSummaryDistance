However, comparatively littleeffort has been devoted so far to thedisambiguation of word subject do-mains.
The few existing approacheshave focused on the development of al-gorithms specific to word domain dis-ambiguation.
In this paper we explorean alternative approach where worddomain disambiguation is achieved viaword sense disambiguation.
Our studyshows that this approach yields verystrong results, suggesting that worddomain disambiguation can be ad-dressed in terms of word sense disam-biguation with no need for specialpurpose algorithms.1 IntroductionWord subject domains have been ubiquitouslyused in dictionaries to help human readers pin-point the specific sense of a word by specifyingtechnical usage, e.g.
see ?subject field codes?
inProcter (1978).
In computational linguistics,word subject domains have been widely used toimprove the performance of machine translationsystems.
For example, in a review of commonlyused features in automated translation, Mowatt(1999) reports that most of the machine transla-tion systems surveyed made use of word subjectdomains.
Word subject domains have also beenused in information systems.
For example, San-filippo (1998) describes a summarization systemwhere subject domains provide users with usefulconceptual parameters to tailor summary re-quests to a user?s interest.Successful usage of word domains in applica-tions such as machine translation and summari-zation is strongly dependent on the ability toassign the appropriate subject domain to a wordin its context.
Such an assignment requires aprocess of Word Domain Disambiguation(WDD) because the same word can often be as-signed different subject domains out of context(e.g.
the word partner can potentially be re-lated to FINANCE or MARRIAGE).Interestingly enough, word subject domainshave been widely used to improve the perform-ance of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)algorithms (Wilks and Stevenson 1998, Magniniet al 2001; Gliozzo et al 2004).
However, com-paratively little effort has been devoted so far tothe word domain disambiguation itself.
Themost notable exceptions are the work of Magniniand Strapparava (2000) and Suarez & Palomar(2002).
Both studies propose algorithms specificto the WDD task and have focused on the dis-ambiguation of noun domains.In this paper we explore an alternative ap-proach where word domain disambiguation isachieved via word sense disambiguation.
More-over, we extend the treatment of WDD to verbsand adjectives.
Initial results show that this ap-proach yield very strong results, suggesting thatWDD can be addressed in terms of word sensedisambiguation with no need of special purposealgorithms.141Figure 1: Senses and domains for the word bank in WordNet Domains, with number of occurrences in SemCor,adapted from Magnini et al (2002).2 WDD via WSDOur approach relies on the use of WordNet Do-mains (Bagnini and Cavagli?
2000) and can beoutlined in the following two steps:1. use a WordNet-based WSD algorithm toassign a sense to each word in the inputtext, e.g.
doctor  doctor#n#12.
use WordNet Domains to map disam-biguated words into the subject domainassociated with the word, e.g.
doc-tor#n#1doctor#n#1#MEDICINE.2.1 WordNet DomainsWordNet Domains is an extension of WordNet(http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) where synonymsets have been annotated with one or more sub-ject domain labels, as shown in Figure 1.
Subjectdomains provide an interesting and useful classi-fication which cuts across part of speech andWordNet sub-hierarchies.
For example, doc-tor#n#1 and operate#n#1 both have sub-ject domain MEDICINE, and SPORT includes bothathlete#n#1 with top hypernym life-form#n#1 and sport#n#1 with  top hy-pernym act#n#2.2.2 Word Sense DisambiguationTo assign a sense to each word in the input text,we used the WSD algorithm presented in San-filippo et al (2006).
This WSD algorithm isbased on a supervised classification approachthat uses SemCor1 as training corpus.
The algo-rithm employs the OpenNLP MaxEnt imple-mentation of the maximum entropyclassification algorithm (Berger et al 1996) todevelop word sense recognition signatures foreach lemma which predicts the most likely sensefor the lemma according to the context in whichthe lemma occurs.Following Dang & Palmer (2005) and Ko-homban & Lee (2005), Sanfilippo et al (2006)use contextual, syntactic and semantic informa-tion to inform our verb class disambiguationsystem.?
Contextual information includes the verbunder analysis plus three tokens found oneach side of the verb, within sentenceboundaries.
Tokens included word as wellas punctuation.?
Syntactic information includes grammaticaldependencies (e.g.
subject, object) and mor-pho-syntactic features such as part ofspeech, case, number and tense.?
Semantic information includes named entitytypes (e.g.
person, location, organization)and hypernyms.We chose this WSD algorithm as it providessome of the best published results to date, as thecomparison with top performing WSD systemsin Senseval3 presented in Table 1 shows---seehttp://www.senseval.org and Snyder & Palmer(2004) for terms of reference on Senseval3.1http://www.cs.unt.edu/~rada/downloads.html.142System Precision Fraction ofRecallSanfilippo et al  2006 61% 22%GAMBL 59.0% 21.3%SenseLearner 56.1% 20.2%Baseline 52.9% 19.1%Table 1: Results for verb sense disambiguation onSenseval3 data, adapted from Sanfilippo et al (2006).3 EvaluationTo evaluate our WDD approach, we used boththe SemCor and Senseval3 data sets.
Both cor-pora were stripped of their sense annotations andprocessed with an extension of the WSD algo-rithm of Sanfilippo et al (2006) to assign aWordNet sense to each noun, verb and adjective.The extension consisted in extending the train-ing data set so as to include a selection ofWordNet examples (full sentences containing amain verb) and the Open Mind Word Expertcorpus (Chklovski and Mihalcea 2002).The original hand-coded word sense annota-tions of the SemCor and Senseval3 corpora andthe word sense annotations assigned by theWSD algorithm used in this study were mappedinto subject domain annotations using WordNetDomains, as described in the opening paragraphof section 2 above.
The version of the SemCorand Senseval3 corpora where subject domainannotations were generated from hand-codedword senses served as gold standard.
A baselinefor both corpora was obtained by assigning toeach lemma the subject domain corresponding tosense 1 of the lemma.WDD results of a tenfold cross-validation forthe SemCor data set are given in Table 2.
Accu-racy is high across nouns, verbs and adjectives.2To verify the statistical significance of these re-sults against the baseline, we used a standardproportions comparison test (see Fleiss 1981, p.30).
According to this test, the accuracy of oursystem is significantly better than the baseline.The high accuracy of our WDD algorithm iscorroborated by the results for the Senseval3data set in Table 3.
Such corroboration is impor-tant as the Senseval3 corpus was not part of thedata set used to train the WSD algorithm whichprovided the basis for subject domain assign-2We have not worked on adverbs yet, but we expect com-parable results.ment.
The standard comparison test for the Sen-seval3 is not as conclusive as with SemCor.
Thisis probably due to the comparatively smaller sizeof the Senseval3 corpus.Nouns Verbs Adj.s OverallAccuracy 0.874 0.933 0.942 0.912Baseline 0.848 0.927 0.932 0.897p-value 4.6e-54 1.4e-07 5.5e-08 1.4e-58Table 2: SemCor WDD results.Nouns Verbs Adj.s OverallAccuracy 0.797 0.908 0.888 0.848Baseline 0.783 0.893 0.862 0.829p-value 0.227 0.169 0.151 0.048Table 3: Senseval3 WDD results.4 Comparison with Previous WDDWorkOur WDD algorithm compares favorably withthe approach explored in Bagnini and Strap-parava (2000), who report 0.82 p/r in the WDDtasks for a subset of nouns in SemCor.Suarez and Palomar (2002) report WDD re-sults of 78.7% accuracy for nouns against abaseline of 68.7% accuracy for the same dataset.
As in the present study, Suarez and Palomarderive the baseline by assigning to each lemmathe subject domain corresponding to sense 1 ofthe lemma.
Unfortunately, a meaningful com-parison with Suarez and Palomar (2002) is notpossible as they use a different data set, the DSOcorpus.3 We are currently working on repeatingour study with the DSO corpus and will includethe results of this evaluation in the final versionof the paper to achieve commensurability withthe results reported by Suarez and Palomar.5 Conclusions and Further WorkCurrent approaches to WDD have assumed thatspecial purpose algorithms are needed to modelthe WDD task.
We have shown that very com-petitive and perhaps unrivaled results (pendingon evaluation of our WDD algorithm with theDSO corpus) can be obtained using WSD as thebasis for subject domain assignment.
This im-provement in WDD performance can be used to3http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC97T12.143obtain further gains in WSD accuracy, followingWilks and Stevenson (1998), Magnini et al(2001) and Gliozzo et al (2004).
A more accu-rate WSD model will in turn yield yet betterWDD results, as demonstrated in this paper.Consequently, further improvements in accuracyfor both WSD and WDD can be expectedthrough a bootstrapping cycle where WDD re-sults are fed as input to the WSD process, andthe resulting improved WSD model is then usedto achieve better WDD results.
We intend toexplore this possibility in future extensions ofthis work.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Paul Whitney for helpwith the evaluation of the results presented inSection 3.ReferencesBerger, A., S.
