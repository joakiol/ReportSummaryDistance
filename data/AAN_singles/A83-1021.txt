We conc luded  that .
for the  shor trun at least, those successes at the right-handend would prove to be self-limiting - knowledgethat was not readily accessible to and modifiableby the medical community at large could notremain in the mainstream of medical practice.Similarly, we saw no immediate prospects for abreakthrough in the algorithmic understandingof free text.

Conceding the importantrole of zvo~-ds (rather than text) as conveyers ofmeaning in medicine, we focused on a hierarchi-ca/ nominal-attribute model, wherein nominals(e lectrons ,  cells, lungs, eta)  were "defined" inte rms  of a t t r ibutes  (spin, neoplast ic ,  congested,etc.).
Obviously, nomina ls  could be a t t r ibutes  ofo ther  h igher  level nominals ,  and a t t r ibutescould be nomina ls  at a lower level.
The principleresu l t  of this model  was the observat ion thatsome words had mean ing  only at certain levels -electrons could not be congested or neoplastic,nor  could Lungs or  cells have spin.
While theidea of "levels of descr ipt ion" is not new, suchlevels were observed to be both well separatedand powerful  determiners  of context in medi-c ine J  In turn.

A corpus of com-puter  readable disease deflmtions was seen tobe a crude instantiat ion of the model.
In thiscorpus each disease was given a name (a nomi-nal).
and defined by its (usually clinical) attri-butes - the original motivation for the corpusbeing the standardization of disease nomencla-lure.
The attr ibutes were written in a tale-graphic, but otherwise asily readable style, andorganized, for each disease, in a relatively stableformat - a form we have chosen to call s t~c-t~d ttzt.Superficially.
the corpus had but one levelof description, at t r ibutes of diseases.
But eachdisease definition was divided, explicitly, into"contexts" (etiology.
symptoms .
.
.
.
.
lab.
x-ray....).
and each disease was place in one (or.
atmost  two) "body systems" (whole body.
skin .....urogenital .
.
.
.
).
These contexts and systemswere obviously strong, if imprecise, determinersof context.Early exper iments  \[3.4\] with this corpus.the computer  eadable version of Cto-rtn2 Msd/-c,., I, tfo,',nu.~n ~ T~n~o~ (C~IT), 4?hEdition \[II\].
explored the selective and associa-tive power of the words it employed, andconfirmed our hypothesis that word use in it wasboth relatively consistent and systematic.
Wesoon realized that the sharpest  est  of the abil-ity of words to convey meaning in this contextwas to evaluate the corpus as a knowledge basefor a "diagnoses program" which would accept adescription of the patient in the form of a l ist ofwords, such as 'pain.
fever, jaundice .... '.
Thespecific diagnostic problem we addressed wasthat of formulating a "differential diagnosis ''z\[12.

which included, as alluded to by Scad-ding \[21, 5\].
diseases that a physician might notothaT~ise think of.

perhaps,  should think of.Important to our attempt to formulate adiagnostic prompting program was not only thatthe knowledge base should be readilycomprehensible, but, if the disease "prompts"were to be credible, the "reasoning" by whichdiseases were retrieved and ranked had to beequally accessible - a consultative criterionnoted by Shortlfffe and co-workers \[P~.
23\].In addition, the availability of a knowledgebase contmning in excess of 3000 diseasedescr ipt ions  has allowed us to study phenomenathat would be hard to reproduce in the contextof most "expert systems".

world.
Briefly.
RECON-SIDER benefits from the high degree of struc-ture observable in diagnostic medicine, in spiteof our ignorance in many areas, and the other-wise general ly unapprec iated stabil ity andspecificity of medical language regarding thisstructure.2.
Zxtmtetattons?Non-medical audiences hould be remindedof differing expectat ions regarding such mean-ing representat ion experiments.
As computerscientists, two of us (MST & DDS) "knew" thatmeaning could not be represented  satisfactori lyby words alone: words were ambiguous, in gen-eral.
and, besides, syntax was a partner withsemantics, and to separate the two was togrossly distort the meaning of either.
4 Weregarded early efforts as potential ly interestingfrom the point of view of statistical linquistics -how did words and contexts associate?
However.the medically trained member  of the initialteam (MSB) predicted the successful perfor-mance  of RECONSIDER once he saw the resultsof  some early word-counting experiments.Later.
SN, an internist with a background inmathematics, anticipated the performance lim-iting aspect of RECONSIDER without ever usingthe program!
(He predicted that inadequaciesin the knowledge base would be more  importantthan any shortcomings in the algorithms bywhich descriptions of patients were "matched"w~th the descriptions of the diseases.

The term "synonym" isused generously, as the dictionary is actuallyfunctioning as a kind of semant ic  net - connect-ing words with strong conceptual  Links.

The User- InterfaceRECONSIDER is an interactive user inter-face running on top of the inverted file and thesearch algorithms.
It accepts terms, searchmodifiers, and requests for one of the twomatching algorithms, formulates the appropri -ate query, searches the inverted files, computesthe score of the diseases retr ieved (ifrequested),  constructs  a body-system histogram(if requested),  ranks the diseases if appropriate,and displays any disease definitions elected forviewing or browsing by the user.5.

(Again.
CADUCEUSconsiders 300 diseases from internal medicine,and PIP considers 20 diseases featuring edema.
)While these cases were often complex, a largeamount  of clinical information was available foreach patient.5.2.
Diagnostic Pr~npt in~:  An ExampleWe believe that RECONSIDER performsbetter, and much more usefully, at an earl ierpoint in the diagnostic process, at a time priorto any extensive patient work-up, when thephysician's "cognitive span" is widest \[2\].For example, a patient presents withfindings as noted at the beginning of the appen-dix.
RECONSIDER begins by prompting forterms.
The prefix ~s/is used by the physician-user to indicate that the succeeding terms areto be searched ~or in either the s'y~npton~s, ors~\]rts portions of Lhe disease descriptions.
Thisgrouping, a union of the two vocabularies, wasnecessitated by the non-consistent usage ofterms in these contexts.
~The phrase oObdo~r~,,/pmL't will match  (given the RECONSIDER optionssetected to run this case) any co-occurrence ofthese two words (or its synonyms) within a si~giectause.
RECONSIDER responds with thesynonyms it knows for the terms entered, andsThe ~ of terms withe CMIT did not follow t~e ~dioaldo~rrm as to what was ?
~m;~om, and what w,,, a ssgn.the number  of diseases containing one of mor'eoccurrences  of each of the te rms within the ss /context.
The response =bdo.tinaL pain\[ 191+80\]indicates that the pah" abdom~n~ pen occurs  in191 diseases and that 80 additional diseaseshave been retr ieved by the synonyms for ~bdom-paL-t, namely ccL/c\[3~\], csL~ck~/~16\], endpWut /n  abdom4~48\] .
The fact that  3.5?15+48exceeds 80. and 191+35+18+48 exceeds191+180, indicates that  some d iseue  definitionscontain more than one te rm from this synonymclass.The score (a measure of selectivity) forabdom~n~ p~n is0.917 = 1 - (271/3262)where 271 is the number  of "diseaseoccurrences"  of abdomma~ p~,  and 3252 is thetotal nurnbar of diseases in CMIT.
A disease'sscore is the sum of the scores of the te rms itsdescript ion matched.Most physicians would probably concludethat  the observation that the patienL smokedwas not relevant to the patient's illness, but  thete rm smo~ was entered here to show its obvi-ous effect on the disease List (it brings n~.ott~ur,to=/?/~ and ~g ~pende.ce ,  ma=-/h~m~nearer  to the top, partly because it is so "seLec-tive").
It is not clear which 'part '  of the diseasedescr ipt ions the te rm ~wlo~g will be found in.so its search context is al l / .
and the same deci-sion is made with respect  o =e/dos.iv.
An/on gap~/dos /8  is not used in C~\]T, so we enter  themore  genera/  form.
I?
Entering swto~lk~g in thea~/context  has the disadvantage that  it bringsin a reference to smoky, which is used as anadjective.The histogram displays the body systemfrequencies for the diseases near the top of thedisease list (the top 4~, was selected by the userto include about the first "screen's  worth" of thedisease List - 8?9 diseases containing one ormore  of the te rms entered, or  their synonyms).A physic ian-user viewing the first screen-full of this ~st (the port ion shown in the appen-dix) would next formulate a strategy for resolv-ing it, assuming the diagnosis was still noLimmediately apparent.
A methodical approachwould note first that no disease matched all fiveentries (as no disease has a score of 4.738).Similarly, diseases #I, #2. and #3 would be ruledout by asking the patient appropr iate questions.

Disease #4, ec to~p~,  raises a moreinteresting issue.
RECONSIDER does not have amodel  of gender  (or of anyth ing  else), so adisease that occurs dur ing pregnancy is notautomatically ruled out when the patient ismale.

/k~l-Umr ExperienceWe have not permi t ted  RECONSIDER to beused '~iva" in a clinical context.
In addition tothe fact that evaluation of the program is notcomplete ,  the knowledge base is known to be outof date.
Nonethe less  ince we have been  able tomove RECONSIDER to the MIS-UCSF VAX 11/750runn ing  UNIX~ (Berkeley 4.1) s tudents ,  post-doctora l  fellows and some facul ty  have been ableto use the program.
The initial reaction usuallyconsists of the following three observations: (I)"Why is that disease there?"
(sometimes it'sthere  Legitimately, and somet imes  not), (2) "Howdoes such a dumb program do so well?"
(refer-ring to RECONSIDER's lack of evident reasoningpower), and (3) "What I need  to be able to do nowis ..." (1111 in your favorite interactive-knowledge-base user-feature).We to lerate  the probiem alluded to by ques-tion (I) because it is more  important, at thisstage of development, not to miss importantdiseases, and because it is easier for aphysician-user to reject totally inappropriatediseases than it is for the program to do so.Question (2) alludes to the point ra ised by thetitle of this paper.
RECONSIDER can only beconsidered an "expert"  (if at all) because itsknowledge base is so Large (relative to what aphys ic ian can keep readi ly  avai lable in his or herhead), and because of its performance.
It isobviously not  like a human "expert"  un the way ita~'~ves at the disease list.
And question (3) wetake to be a comphment  that reveals, amongother things, that occasionally the utility ofRECONSIDER is iu~uted not by the knowledge iteonteuns, but by the means  we currently have ofaccessing it through the narrow window of a 23-line CRT terminal.Question (1) deserves  fu r ther  comment .The author (MST) has observed  considerableuser-discomfort caused by CMIT hexing diseasesfrom several body systems near the top of aeUN1X is a produc~ of Ben Telephone Laboratories, ~nc.sor ted  disease list.
Apparently,  the  cognit ived issonance is usual ly  avoided by th ink ing aboutd iseases  by system,  an the discomfort can berel ieved by rest r ic t ing the  search  (and thus  thesor ted  list) to a single body sys tem.
The prob-lem with the la t ter  pract ice  is that  the  pre l im-inary results of our evaluation reveals that con-textless (0~/searches) are the most e~Lcacious.on average.
AS this is also the opposite of thebehavior predicted by our model of context in anorruna/-attribute knowled4\[e base.

In any case, it  may prove neces-sary to re-des ign the user - in tor face  to accomo-date some users '  need to view deseases  by sys-tem, within a contextless search.7.
