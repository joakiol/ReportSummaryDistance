The value t of this threshold is indivldualfor each agent in different communicative situation.The values of these indices are generated underthe influence of different psychological, ethical,pragmatical and other factors.

Hence the  va lues  o fre levancy  ind ices  may a lso  vary .We consider interpersonal communication asj o in t  ac t iv i ty  o f  LI agents  (X and  Y) .

For X another way of achieving klbased on the  va lues  o f  some other  const i tuents  o fthe  cont ract  shou ld  be chosen .3 .3 .
E lementary  cont racts  wb ich  regu la teach ievement  o f  t i le  metagoa l  k2 are  based  on thedependency  re la t ion :  (X<Y,G ' , t3 )  .

But the index BEN(Y,g~G.X)has to exceed the value t4 being determined by thelevel of cooperation between the partners.3.4.
The basic *'elations aren' t  mutuallyexclusive or interdependent: the domination of Xover Y in the class G' doesn't exclude the domina-tion of Y over X in the same class G' and doesn'tpresuppose the Y's dependency on X.
The completecontract includes decomposition of the set of poten-tial goals into classes, for each of which the givenrelations are defined on the part of X as well as onthe part of Y,4.
NEUTRALITY, COOPERATION AND CONFLICT4.l.Basie relations reflect certain social andpsychological roles of the LI agents.
The absence ofthese relations between the partners leaves themodes of achieving the metagoals to LI agents'choice.
These modes are divided into three groups,according to the degree of mutually accounting foreach other's intercs?s.
These groups determine threetypes of contracts: neutral, cooperative andconflicting ones.
There exists the follwing set ofmodes: admissibil ity/inadmissibil ity of deformationof the basic relations, possibility of reciprocalconcessions, usage of  additional informationstimulating a successful achievement of the agent'sgoal.
This stimulus may be positive (plus-stimulus)or negative (minus-stimulus).4,2 .
The neutral contract presupposes theinadmissibility of deformation of  tile basicrelations.In case of absence of domination of X over Y(X~Y,G',t2) it is necessary for X to make Y beinterested in achievement of a goal gE  G' forrealizing the metagoal k I=(E6G.Y) ,  i.e.
to make thevalue of index BEN(Y,g) > t2.
Neutral contractsallows X to use one of two possible means: a) to letY know of some information increasing the value ofthe index BEN(Y,g); and b) to let Y know of a goalg' being included in the X's system of goals, withBEN(Y,g')+BEN(Y,g)>t2.
Provided that the propositionBEN(Y,g)<t2 belongs to the set M and it isimpossible fur X to use one of the two meansmentioned above, X has to give up the meta-goal k l=(g~G.Y) .In case of (X~Y,G',t4) the neutral contractcommits X to take Y's interests into account.
X mayinclude a goal g into G.X if this goal is harmlessfor Y (INT (Y,g)>O).
If the value of the indexINT(Y,g) is negative, it is necessary for X toguarantee some compensation for presupposed damage,i.e.
to include a goal g' into G.X.
with BEN(Y,g~ G.X)+BEN(Y,g' 6 O.X)>t4.
Otherwise X has to givehis goal g up.So neutral contracts provide the accomplishmentof the metagoals by means of basic relations and byusing plus-stimuli.4.3.
Cooperative contracts are characterized byrec iproca l  "c red i t " ,  i .e .
mutua l  concess ions  areposs ib le .
Each agent  may a l low in f r ingement  o f  h i sin teres ts .
The degree  o f  in f r ingement  i s  determinedby the  leve l  o f  cooperat ion  and  i s  f i xed  in  theva lues  t i  o f  re levancy  ind ices .
Cooperat ivecont racts  a l low modi f i ca t ion  o f  bas ic  re la t ions ,  i ti s  poss ib le  fo r  any  agent  not  to  do h i s  duty  or  to230exceed,  h i s  r ights .In  case  o f  X>Y the  inc lus ion  o f  a goa l  in to  thesys tem G.Y i s  poss ib le  i f  the  va lue  o f  the  indexCST(V,g)  i s  fa r  less  than  t5  and the  va lue  o f  t i leindex BEN(X,g) is more than t6, where t5 and t6 aredetermined by the level of cooperation.
If the valueof index CST(Y,g) is more than t5 but X doesn't giveup the metagoal k l=(g~G.Y},  then X may use plus-stimulus, i.e.
compensation of presupposed damage.In case of X~Y it is possible for X to achievethe metagoal k I=(gEG.Y)  without using any stimulus,if the value of the index CST(Y,g) is less than t5Provided that CST(Y,g)>t5, X has to use plus-stimulus for including the goal g into the G.Ysystem.
The partner Y, on his turn, has to includethe goal g into his system of goals, if CST(Y,g)<t5and BEN(X,g)>t6 .Cooperat ion  permi ts  the  mod i f i ca t ion  o f  thebasic relation X<Y, it means that it is possible forX to include a goal g into his system ofgoals in spite of the value of the indexBEN(V,gQG.X)  being less than t2.
In other words, Ymay give permission for X's inclusion of the goal ginto the system G.X in spite of BEN(Y ,gE  G.X)<t2If the value of the index BEN(Y,g~G.X)  is far lessthan t2 then it is necessary for X to use plus-stimulus: to promise the inclusion of thegoal g', with BEN(Y ,gEG.X)+BEN(Y ,g~ G.Y)>t2.In case of X<?
it is necessary for X to takeinto account Y'x interests: to include a goal withINT(Y,g6G.X)>O.
Provided that INT(Y,g~G.X)<O, itis necessary for X to guarantee compensation forsuccess of the metagoal k2=(g~G.X) .
As for ?, it ispossible for him to a/low some infringement of hisinterests: X may include a goal g into G.X, if thevalue of index BEN(Y,gEG.X)  is not much less thant2.
In this case X may succeed in achievement of tilemetagoal k2=(g~G.X)  without using of plus-stimulus.4.4.
The conflicting contracts allow agents touse minus-stimulus and to break tile basic rela-tions.The break of elementary contracts based on X'sdomination over V is characterized by Y's refusal ofincluding the goal g into his system of goals inspite of X's demand, if the value of the iadexBEN(Y,g) is less than tl.As for, X it is possible for him to use aminus--stimulus for achieving the metagoal k\]=(g~ G,Y) in  both the cases X>V and X}Y. Minus-stimulus is X's promise to include a goal g' intoG.X with BEN(Y,g'E G.X) being far less than t2.
Thispromise induces Y to inclade the goal g into G.Y inorder to avoid accomplishment of the goal g'.
Undera conflict for achieving the metagoal k2=(gE  G.X) it is possible for X not to get Y'spermission for including a goal g into G.X in bothtile cases X<Y and X~V.
Conflicting contracts allow Xto include any goal without taking into account Y'sinterests.
If it is necessary for X to get Y'spermission for achieving the goal g, he may useminus-stimulus to force assent out of Y.5.
