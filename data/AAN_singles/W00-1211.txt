Significance of the research es init provides a solid foundation for theChinese parser.Keywords: Chinese base phraseidentification, parsing, statistical model1 IntroductionDecomposing syntactic analysis intoseveral phases o as to decrease its difficultyis a new stream in NIP research.
Thesuccessful POS tagging has encouragedresearchers to explore further possibility forresolving sub-problems in parsing(Zhou, etal, 1999).
The typical examples are therecognition of BaseNP in English andChinese.In English BNP (base noun phrase) isdefined as simple and non-nesting nounphrases, i.e.
noun phrases that do not containother noun phrase descendants (Church,1988).
After that researches on BNPidentification reports promising results forsuch task in English.
Observing that theChinese BNP is different form English,(Zhao & Huang, 1999) puts forward thedefinition of Chinese BNP in terms ofcombination of determinative modifier andhead noun.
According to them a BNP inChinese can be recursively defined as:BaseNP ::= Determinative modifier +Noun I Nominalized verb(NIODeterminative modifier ::= Adjective IDifferentiable Adjective(DA) I Verb I Noun ILocation I String l Numeral + ClassifierInspired by these researches, we extendthe concept of BNP to Base Phrase inChinese.
It is based on such knowledge thatthere are many structures, not only NP, inwhich the trivial components closely attachto their central words and constitute a basicphrase in a Chinese sentence.
Obviously,resolving all these base phrases will greatlybenefit Chinese parser by reliving it fromsome pre-processing (though non-trivial)and enable it focus on the most subtlesyntactic structures.Since the whole system of Chinese basephrase is still under discussing, this paperjust presents some tentative researchachievements on statistics based hybridmodel to Chinese base phrase identification.For the 7 types we considered at present, ouralgorithm turns out promising results andsmoothes the way for a better Chineseparser.2 Statistics Based Hybrid Approach toChinese Base Phrase Identification2.1 Concepts and DefmitionsIn addition to BNP, constituents ofmany local structure in Chinese centersaround a core word with certain fixed POSsequences.
Therefore their identification isslightly different from parsing in that itbears relatively simple phenomenon.
LikeBNP identification, identification of thesephenomena before parsing will provide asimpler sequence for parser, and thusdeserves a separate r search.CutTenfly, we are considering 7 Chinesebase phrases in our research, namely baseadjective phrase(BADJP), base adverbialphrase (BADVP), base noun phrase (BNP),73base temporal phrase (BTN), base locationphrase (BNS), base verb phrase (BVP) andbase quantity phrase (BMP) Thoughtheoretically definitions for these basephrases are still unavailable, Appendix I liststhe preliminary illustrations for them inBNF format (necessary account for POSannotation can also be found)..To frame the identification of Chinesebase phrases, we fm'ther develop thefollowing concepts:Definition 1: Chinese based phrases arerecognized as atomic parts of a sentencebeyond words that posses certain functionsand meanings.
A base phrase may consist ofwords or other base phrases, but itsconstituents, in turn, should not contain anybase phrases.Definition 2: Base phrase tag is thetoken representing the syntactic function ofthe phrase.
At present, base tag either falls inone of the 7 Chinese base phrases we areconsidering or not:Phrase-Tag ::= BADJP I BADVP I BNP IBr  r l Bm I BrP I BMP I lVULLDefinition 3: Boundary tag denotes thepossible relative position of a word to a basephrase.
A boundary tag for a gfven word iseither L( left boundary of a base phrase),R( right boundary of a ), I(inside a basephrase) or O(outside the base phrase).2.2 Duple Based HMM ParserBased on above definitions, we could,in view of Wojciech's proposal \[Wojeieeh andThorsten, 1998\], interpret the parsing ofChinese base phrases as the following:Suppose the input as a sequence of POSannotations T= (to, ....... t , , ) .
The task is tofind RC, a most possible sequence of duplesformed by base phrase tags and boundarytags, among the POS sequence T.RC = (<ro, co > ........ <rn, Cn>),in whil~h ri ( l  <i< =n )indicates the boundarytags, ci represents he base phrase tags.To go along with the POS taggerdeveloped previously by us, we first think ofpreserving HMM (hidden Markov Model)for parsing Chinese base phrases.
Thus thefollowing formula is usually?at hand:RC = arg max p(RC I T)= arg max p(RC)*  p (T IRC)p(T)For a given sequence of T, this formulacan be transformed into:RC = arg max p(RC IT)= arg max p(RC)*p(T  \ [RC)Essentially this model could beestablished through bigram or tri-gramstatistical training by a annotated corpus.
Inpractice, we just build our model froml O, O00 manual annotated sentences withcommon bi-gram training:p(RC p(RC , IRC  ,_,)i=1p(T  I RC ) = 1FI p (T i  I RC i)i= lIn realization, a Viterbi algorithm isadopted to search the best path.
An open teston additional 1000 sentences i  performed tocheck its accuracy.

Results for Duple Based HMM2.3 Triple Based MM ExploitingLinguistic InformationAlthough results shown in Table 1 i sencouraging enough for research purposes,it is still lies a long way for practicalChinese parser we are aiming at.
Reasonsfor errors may be account by toocoarse-grained information provided by RC.Observing the fact that the Chinese basephrase occurs more frequently with somefixed patterns, i.e.
some frozen POS chains,we decide to improved our previous modelby emphasizing the contribution given byPOS information.Adding t denoting POS in the duple (r,74c), we develop a triple in the form of (t,r,e)for the calculation of a node.
Naturally, thenew model is changed into a MM (Markovmodel) as:TRC = arg max p(TRC )= arg max I~  p(TRC i I TRC i - 1)To train this model, we still using abi-gram model.
Applying the same corpusand tests described above, we got theperformance of triple based MM identifierfor Chinese base phrases (see Table 2).Precision Precision Precisionfor R ~rC89.2% 91 .5% 84.6%88.4% 89.9% 83%CloseOpenfor BothR and CTable 2.
Result for Triple Based MM2.4 Further  Improvement Through TBEDLearningLike other statistical models, the abovemodel, whether duple based or triple based,both seem to reach an accuracy ceiling afterenlarging training set to 12, 000 or so.
Tocover the remaining accuracy, we apply thetransformation-based error driven (TBED)learning strategy described in \[Brill, 1992\]to acquired esired rules.In our module, some initial rules arefirst designed as compensation of statisticalmodel.
Applying these rules will cause newmistakes as well as make correctidentifications.
Then the module willcompare the processed texts with trainingsentences, generate new rules according topre-defmed actions and update its rule bankafter evaluation (see Fig 1.

TBED Learning ModuleThe dotted line in fig 2. will stopfunctioning if pre-set accuracy is reached bythe identifier for the Chinese base phrase.Evaluation of new rules is based on angreedy algorithm: only rule with maxcontribution (max correction and rain error)will be added.
Design of rule generation(pre-defined actions) is similar to thosedescribed in \[Brill, 1992\].Table 3 shows a significantimprovement after applying rules obtainedthrough TBED learner.

Processing ofChinese Based Phrase IdentificationHowever, the 7 types Chinese basephrases we have proposed are far l~omperfection.
Even what we have proposed forthe 7 phrases is still under test.
Furtherimprovement will focus on two aspects: oneis to discuss and add new base phrase for abroader coverage; the other is to define,theoretically or empirically, the Chinesebase phrases with more strict constraints.
Ofcourse, new techniques to improved theaccuracy of statistical model are the constantaim of our research.To sum up, Chinese base phraseidentification will reduce complexity of aChinese parser.
The successful idemifieationof the 7 base phrases clearly simplifies thestructure of the sentence.
We expect hat theresearch described in this paper will lay asolid foundation for a high-accuracyChinese parser.22(2): pp141-146\[Zhou, et al 1999\] Zhou Qiang, SunMao-Song, Huang Chang-Ning, Chunkparsing scheme for Chinese sentences,Chinese J.
