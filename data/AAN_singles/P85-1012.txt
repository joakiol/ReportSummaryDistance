The elementaryfrees are divided into gwo sets: initLll and auxiliary.
Initialwea have only terminals at their leaves.
A~///m.y we~ aredistinguished by having role non-terminal among theirleaves; the category of th/s node must be the same u the,~tegol~ of the root.

To adjoin an auxiliary tree A with reo?,-~tegory X to a in/t/a/ (or c lenv~) tree T, we first se/eczsome node of catesory X within T to be the point atwhich the adjunction is to occur.
Then (1) the subcree ofT dominated by that instance of X (carl it X') is removedfrom T, (2) the au.vili~ry ~ A is kn/t into T at thepos/tioQ where X" had beret Icelted, and (3) die sublreedetainer_..4 by X" is kn/t into A to replace the secondcgcurencu of the catego~ X at T's frontier.
The two treeshave now been merged by "up/icing" A into T, disp/acingthe subcrea of T at the pmnt of the adjunction to thefromier of A.For ~-ram~e we cmdd take the initial tree:~.

The grammar writermay specify which specific trees may be adjoined to a givennode in an elementary tree; if no specification is given thedefault is that there is no constraint and that any auxiliarytree may be adjoined to the node.2.1 Key f,_,_m~ of the theory of TAG'sA TAG tqxectfi~ mrfaee m'ucture.
There is no notionof derivation from deep structure in the theory ofTAG's- - the primitive trees are not transformed or otherwisechanged once they are introduced into a text, onlycombined with other primitive trees.
As Kmch and Jmhipoint out, this means that a TAG is incomplete ms anaccount of the structure of a natural language, e.g.
a TAGgrammar wW contain ~th  an active and a passive form ofthe same verbal sutx:ategurization pattern, without antheory-mediated escription of the very clme relationshipbetween them.To our minds this is by uo means a deficit.
Thep~c~lural  machinery that generative grammars havetraditionally carried with them to characterize relations likethat of active to passive has only gotten in the way ofemploying tho~ characterizations in processing models ofgeneration.
This is because a generation model, like anytheory of performance, has a procedural m'ucture of itsown and cannot coexist with an incompatible one, at leastnot while still operating efficiently or while retainin 5 asimple mapping from its actual machine to the virtualmachine that its authors put forward ms their ao~unt  ofpsycholinguistic data.Our own generator uses surface structure ms its onlyexpficifly represented linguistic level.
Thus grammaticalformalisms that dwell on the rules governing surface formare more useful to us than those that hide those rules in adeep to surface transformational process.A TAG Involves the manlpulatlea of very mmaildemantary m'uctures.
This is _'~'__~_use of the stipulationthat elementary trees may not include recumve nodes.
Itimplies that the sentences one ~ in everyday usage, e.g.aewpaper texts, are the result of many _o_,__e~6_ 're adjunctions.This melds nicely with a move that we have made inrecent years to view the conceptual representation fromwhich generation proceeds ms consisting of a heap of verysmall, redundantly related information units that have beendefiberately selected by a text plannin~g ~ from thetotal state of the knowledge base at the time of utterance;each such unit will correspond in the final te~ to a headlexical item plus selected thematic arguments--a linguisticentity that is easily projected onto the elementary trees of aTAG.TAG U~n7 Indudes ~ ly  ow operm~oa, mqemetlom,and otherwim .

text.
This compom well with the indefibllitympulatiou in our mode/ of gene~uion, tince adected textfragments ~ be ~ d i~y all ~ by th@ gl~mm~rwithout the need for any later transformation.
Thecomposition options delimited by the constraints onadjunction given with a TAG define a space of alternativetext forms which can correspond directly in generation toalternative conceptual relations among information units,alternatives in rhetorical intent, and alternatives in t,,~mestyle.3.
Adapt ing  TAG's  to  Generat ionThe mapping from TAG's  as a formaligm forcompetence theories of language to our formalism forgeneration is strikingly direct.
As we described in Section 5their adjunction operation corresponds to our attachmentWcgess; their constraints ou adjunction correspond to ourattachment points; their surface structure trees correspoad toour surface structure trees, t We further hypothesize thattwo quite strong correspondence claims can be made,though considerably more experimentation and theorizingwill have to be done with both formalisms before theseclaims can be c~nfirmed.I.
The primitive information units in renlizationspecifications can be realized exclusively ms one oranother elementary tree ms def'med by a suitableTAG, i.e.
linguistic criteria can be used inderermmmg the proper modularity of theconceptual structure.
22.
Convex~ly, for any textual relationship which ourgenerator would derive by the attachment ofmultiple information units into a ~ingle package,there is a correslxmding rule of adjunct/on.
Sincewe u~ attachment in the rp,~li,~tiou of nominalcompounds like "o// tanker', this has the force ofextending the domain of TAG analyses intomorphology.

1"he P lace  o f  Grammar  in a Tneory  o fGenerat /onTo understand why we are looking at TAG's  ratherthan some other formaJi~n, one must first understand therole of grammar within our ~ g  model.

To achieve this, we have restricted om~lves toa highly constrained set of representations and operations,?nd have adopced strong and mgge~ve stipulations on ourdmigu such as high locality, information encaptmlation,online qua~-realtimo rtlotime performan~, and inclelibility.

Two of themo~ important generation systems that have beendeveJoped, PROTEUS ~Davey 1974\] and NIGEL \[Mann &Manhie~en 1983\], am systemic grammar, and others,including ourselves, have been mongly influenced by it.The reasons for this entb,,tlatm are central to the specialconcerns of generation.
Systemic grammars employ afunctional vocabulary: they empha~/ze the uses to whichlanguage can be put--how languages achieve their speakers"goaLs-rather than its formal structure.
Since the generationpmcem begins with goals, unlike the comprehension processwhich begins with structure, this orientation makes systemicgrammars more immediately useful than, for example,tramffotmationai generatb,+ grammars or even procedurallyoriented AI fogmali-qa~s |of language such as ATN's.The generation researcher's primary question is why useone construction rather than another--active instead ofpa~ive, "the" instead of "a'.
"toe principle device of asystemic grammar, the "choice system", mppom thisquestion by highlighting how the constructions of thelanguage are gmupud into met of a l temativet Choicesystems pro~tde an anchoring point for the rules of atheory of language u~ tin,-,, it it natural to associate thevaziotm romantic, d i sgou~,  or rhetorical criteria that bearoa the mlection of a given ~ o n  or feature with thechoice system to which the consmmtion belongs, thusproviding the basis of a decision-Wm:edure for rejectingfrom its Listed atternatives; the NIGEL sy~em does ~ ythis in its "chooser" p~c~_~M_ures.In our formal ism ~ make tt~e o~ ttu~ saint i~l'ormatWna.?
a sy~emic grammar captures, however we have choosen tobundle it quite di f feremly.
The  maderlyiog reat~ for this isthat our concern for p~/cholinguistic modeling and efficientprocemin~ takes ~ c e  in our design decisions abouthow the facts of language and language me should berepretented in a generator.
It is thus instructive to look atthe different kinds of linguistic information that a networkof choice systems carry.
In our system we distribute the~,--to separate computational devimm.o Delx~cl?ncies among smmtutal features: A generatormust respect the constraints that dependencies impomand appgeciam ,.he impact they have on itsreafization options: for example that tomemburdinate da-,~_ can am express ten~ or modalitywhile main datum are required to; or that aj~ in l l  ~ Ob~Ol~ foN pll~de ~ e n twhile a lealcal ob~cts leaves it optiomd.96o Usage criteria.
The deei_'Moa pr~___~_mms associatedwith each choice system are not a part of theoammsLr pl~ m, althOUgh thfy ~ natllg~yasaociated with it and organized by it.
Also mosts~lra~\[lic glr'amm~ll include V~'y a ~  f~tuns  ~tehas "geneS: reference" or "completed action', which~e la te  the language's surface fennues, andthus are more controllert of why a construct is -_~_rather than consmJcu themsetva.o Coordinated mucunal  alternative=.
A teutence maybe either active or passive, either a question or astatement.
By grouping these Mternatives intosystems and using the:m systems exclusively whenconstructing a teat, one is guaranteed not to~bine  inconsistent ttruetural featun=.o Efficieat ordering of choice~ The network thata~mects choice systems p~ovides a aamral pathbetweeu decision, which if followed strictlyguarentees that a choice will not be made unlem itis required, and that it will aot be made before anyof the choices that it is it~If dependent upon,insuring that it can be made indelibly.o Typology of surface structure.
Almost by accident(since its specification is distributed throughout all ofthe systems implicidy), the stammer determines thepattern of dominance and cmtstituency relatiomhipsof the ta t .

The first symbol in,.~eh_ expression is a labet indicating the function of thatitem within the plan; embett,bM__ items appearing in anglebrackets ere in/ormatiou units from the current-eventsknowledge base.Obviously this plan must be considerably refined beforeit could mrve as a proximal toarce for the text; that iswhy we point out that it is a "toplevel" plan.
It is aspecification for the general outline of the utterance whichmum l~ flC~lhed out by rtgugsive planning OUce itsrealization has begun and the LC can mpply a linguisticcontext to further constrain the choices for the units andthe rhetorical fcatunm.For present purposes, the key fact to a l~re  aboutthis realization specification is how different it is in formfrom the surface structure.
One cannot produce the -itedtext simply by travemng and "reading oat" the dements ofthe specification as though one were de~gproduction.
S ~  rearrangements are required, andthese must be done under the coutrol of constraints whichcan only be stated in linguis~ vocabulary with terms like"subject" or "r~i~in$'.The fire unit in the qxcification, #<satin.civet.type..>,is a relation over two other units.
It indicates that acommotmiity between the two has been noticed and deemedsignificam in the underlying representation of the event.The premat LC always realize, such relatious by mergingthe realizations of the two units.
If nothing else occurred,this would give us the ta t  "Two od tanker, were ~ bymits/~r".97As it happens, however, a penclmg rhetorical constra/ntfrom the rcef i~t ion specification,~v 8wto-sotm~will force the addition of yet another information unit, 6 thereporting event by the ~ service that announced thea/edged event (e.g.
a press relce.~ from Iraq, Reuters, etc.
).In this case the "content" of the ~ event is the twowhich have already been p/armed forinclusion in the utterance as past of the "particulars" partof the specification.
L~ us look closely at how thatreportiing event unit is folded into turface mmcture.When am itself the focus of attention, aevent is typically realized u "so-and-,m said X' ,  that is, thecontent of the report is more important than the reportitsel/; whatever sigmficance the report or its source has asnewu will be indicated subtlly through which of thealternative realizations below is selected for it.

The motimportant difference of interest theoretically is that whilesystemic choice systems select among s/ogle alternativefeatures (e.g.
