However, current approaches generally require a great deal of laboriously constructed human-annotated training data.
Ideally, a computer would be able to acquire language like a child by beingexposed to linguistic input in the context of a relevant but ambiguous perceptual environment.
Asa step in this direction, we have developed systems that learn to sportscast simulated robot soccergames and to follow navigation instructions in virtual environments by simply observing sample hu-man linguistic behavior in context.
This work builds on our earlier work on supervised learning ofsemantic parsers that map natural language into a formal meaning representation.
In order to applysuch methods to learning from observation, we have developed methods that estimate the meaning ofsentences given just their ambiguous perceptual context.602
