grammar.
The syntax is dealt wi$h by matching.Jwith $emplates; the semantics by the application of semanticre$trictions to syntactically associated pairs of word meanings.To lirn~t the number of paths, all available guns, syntactic andsemantic, are brought to bear at every stage.
The output is alist of disambiguated word meanings, formed into a tree structurebut with semantic rather than syntactio relationships betweepthem.The French generation first makes appropriate tense changes,then finds the French word(s) and redistributes them ifnecessary.
This may generate a French structure radicallydifferent from the English, Then the words are sequenced andput into the correct form.The program consists of about 8,500 Fortran irlstructions andthe processing averages about 15 seconds per word on a 36.0-40.TABLE OF CONTENTSIntroduction .........................................

Conclusion 48My *banks are due to the Managers of IBM Near East and+IBMLebanon and many members of the staff of IBM Lebanon, who havehelped and encouraged me i n  every way.
I am a l s o  indebted t oY o r i c k  Wilks, Margaret K i n g  and Walther Bischoff of theFondazione dalle Molle, who have been very he3pful with their aadvice and ideas.INTfRODUCTIONThere are, I hope three reasons why CLAM will be ofinterest to computational linguists.
( 1 )  Ir; 1s a working model.
This is not a "paperf1containing ltideas".
Lt is a description of a model which works,To be more specific, it is a description of a large program,written in FORTRAN, which runs on a 960-40.
It accepts as inputEnglish $ext, carrieg out a syntactic and semantic analysis of!it, stores the result, and translates it into good French.
(2) The subset of English which it is capable of analysingis, by present standards, extremely large, The vocabulary isabout 1300 words, many of which have a variety of meanings.
Moreimportant that the size of the vocabulary is, of course, therange of syntactic structure's and, perhaps most significantly,the degree of complexity of senkences which can be dealt with,Increasing the length and complexltg of sentences does not bringlikelihood of combinat orial explosion.
The amount of workingstore and computing time required to analyse a sentence is ofthe order of the number of words in a sentence, although ofcourse it varies according to the number of meanings of the wordsand the types of syntactic structure involved.
(3) The program is continuously extensible.
Thisextensi'bility applies first t~ the subset of language which canbe analysed, secondly to the target languages into which trans-lations can be generated, and thirdly bo the uses to which theanalysis of the rext can be put.
Tn other words, I believe thatthe program embodies 3 sound method of syntactic and semanticanalysis such as must be the basis of a computer l a w a g e  model.Extension of the subset of language which can be malysedis a matter of addition and refinement.
It can be stated withconfidence that such extension can be achieved because nothingfundamentally different from what has already been achieved isinvolved.
New syntactic structures, well formed or otherwise,can be incorporated, by addition partly to the files and partlyto Ohe program.
Continual refinements can be made to the methodof finding pronoun antecedents.
This problem, which seems to begenerally accepted as the most difficult single problem inanalysis, will never be solved by one simple algorithm, and thefact that a particular program at any given stage of its develop-ment gives the wrong answer in a particular case, so far frominvalidating the prograp, rather points the way to furtherrefinements (cf.
Wilks, June 1975).
What is important is thatthe program should provide the tools which enable the refinementto be made, and CLAM does this.Extension of the target languages involves applying toother languages the same method which is used to generate French.This can be done, and indeed part of the actual program used forFrench would be generally applic3ble.
It will be interesting toattack a language outside the Indo-European group, and Arabic isthe first one I have in mind, although how soon this can be doneis a question of time and priocities,The obvious use to which the analysis can be put other than6translation is a questionLanswer system, and work on this is atpresent in hanb.
A question-answer system must be based on aneffective malyser, and it is beljeved that CLAM can providethis.
However, I do not maintain that the analyser Sb~uld beindependent of9the memory and inferencihg part of the sy$te~n.Obviously it should not be independent of the memory, since ananalyser   nu st create and use its own memory, and although itwould be theoretically possible for the analyser to have onetype of memory and the latter part of the program to haveanother, this would be a ludicrous arrangement.
The sameargument applies tp inferencing, which again has to be performed.by an analyser.
Therefore it seems that a question-answersystem should be more integrated than rnany A.1.
reseqrcher,~appear to allow.
On this score, I support the view of Wilksvis-a-vis Charniak.To create a que~tion~answer system, and, indeed, to improvethe translation program, -t;he memory and the semantics of thepresent program have to be developed.
I use the word "developed"advisedly because I believe that the ekisting memory andsemantics form a sound basis upon which a more comprehensivesystem can be built.RESULTSAssessment of the Subset of Language which the Model can AnalyseIt is normal practice when describing a language model toleave d;iscussion of the achievedents of the model until the end.First comes the description of how the model doeslor ~ o u l doperate, then, if it is actually in operation, an account ofwhat &t can do.
En this description I am reversing 3heprocedure, becauge I would not like to think of a readerploughing through details of how something is done ii hesubsequently comes to the conclusion that what was done was notworth doing anyway, Let him first sge what can be done, andthen decide whether it is w~rth the trouble of reading on todiscover how it is done.Having said this, I am immediately conYronted by the problemadrunbrated by Woods of how a reader can assess the range andscope of a particular model, and by implication, of how theprogrammer can honestly present it.
There are two standardmethods of prepentation.
One is by rather sweeping generalstatements such as "the program can cope with noun clauses.adjectival clauses, conjunction, questions" etc., according towhat claims are being made, Such generalisations are inevitablysuspect and rightly so, since no reader will believe that hecould not find, for example, adjectival clauses which the programcould not cope with.
The alternative method of presentation isto give sample sentences which the program has coped with, andhope that the reader will make for himself the type of general-isation which the programmer has scrupulously avoided.
If thefirst method is adopted, the programmer may justifiably bebranded as a charlatan.
If the second, he runs the risk ofhaving his sent-encesdismissed as "a few examples",The problem is real, and the solution far from obvious:how to define a subset of language.
Supposing that we wereconCerned only with single sentences and not longer texts; andsupposing that it were possible, which evidently it is not, $0list all the sentences of the subset: the11 how can we find adefinition which ,wou&d include a l l  the sentences which we havelisted and exc1ud.e any which we have not listed?
Two thingsare clear.
The definition would be very long, ahd it wouldcontain an agglomeration of embedded provisos, For example + thesection on relative Clauses might include something like this:Relative clauses are admissible, provided that1 .
they do not contain more Zhan seven words ;2. they do not contain a passive verbunless (a) it is a verb of Icookmgtol- (b) the clause is a vsubject' clause;3. there is no word between the noun and the relativeclause unless it is part of a supervening relativeclause;4, the noun 1s not part of a subsidiary clause unlessthe subsidiary clause is itself a relatlve clauseprovided that (a) the noun is not the object of theclauseand (b) the noun is not a 'time1 noun.All of the above provisos are of a type which could well beapplicable at any particular stage in the development of aprogram, although some may be more likely than others.
Theprogrammerls difficulty is that until he has tried an appropriatetype of sentence, he probably will not realise the existence of a9particular limitation.
The first indication of it is that thesentence doesn't work, and he then has to rack his brain tofindrout w h y  not, and alter the program to eliminate the limit-ation, thereby enlarging the subset in that particular direction(hoping that he is not at the same time being so stupid as toreduce it' in another).
Therefore if a programmer asserts thathis program can deal with e .
g , ,  relative clauses of all types,he is probably not being dishonest but m ~ r e l y  ignorant aboutthe limitations of his o m  program.
Whether such lirnitat50nsshould rightly be described as bugs, which Wood,s implies, isdubious, because that is tantamount .Q;o execting a program whichcan deal with some relative clauses to be able to deal with allrelative clauses.
and asserting that insofar as it cannot, some-thing has gone wrong.
R a t h e r  might one think of a program interms of a pool of w a t e r  spreading slowly over an area andgradually covering more and mare of that area.
The fact thatthe water covered a particular part of the area wottld carry noimplication of covering any other part, although ther'e would bea reasonable expectation of its spreading to a contiguous areanext.
This analogy, though valuable in helping to destroy amisconception, is evidently incomplete in two respec%-s.
It istwo-dimensional, whereas.language is #multi-dimensional; and theprogram would advance not continuously, like a pool of water,but by fits and starts, in discrete steps.
Each of these pointsis worth further examination,Lip service has long been paid to the multi-dimensionalnature of language, and yet the importance of this aspect inI0attempting to analyse language has rather slowly comb to berecognised, How many features are there whlch have to be talceninto account, and what are they?
How m a n y  possible relation-ships can exist between t~hiclz of t l l e ~ n ?
And, a r l u o s t i o nraised with particular force by coniputer analysers, whatcombinations of features are relevant?
As a simple esaztiple,consider two features, both as it happens syntactic althoughthe argument applies to semantic as ~ 8 1 1  as s y n t a c - t i e  features:ralative clauses, and the passive voice.
If a program cananalyse each of the features separately, does it follow thatit can analyse them in combination?
Suppose, for example, itcan arlalyse both of these sentences:1.
The man who came to dinner stole the silver.2.
The man was hit by a bus.Does it follow that it can analyse this?The man who was hit by a bus stole the silver.Alas, it does not.
It may iin fact be able to, but there is nological rule from which it can be deduced that it must be ableto.
Is the absence of' suc a rule merely a computational quirk,or does it corres~ond to some linguLstic truth?
In this case,but not necessarily in all such cases, I would say that it doesso c~rrespond.
We may asK ourselves if it is possible to imaginea language in which relative clauses e&ist, and the passivevoice exists, but in which the verb In a relative clause cannotbe in the passive.
Of course it is, and *here may for all IKnow be such languages.
It +is this absence of a logical rule ofcombination which makes the task of defining the bounds of asubset of language so appallingly difficult, especially when itis remembered that it is not merely combinations of two features,9 s  in the above example, but combinations of many features whichhave to be taken into account.
Multi-dimensiona3l.y is such acardinal characteristic of language that analysgrs dealing withtiny subsets from which this characteristic lias been removedshould probably be treated with reserve.
They may give valuableinsights, but they may also be nxisleading, I do not of courserefer to the memory oP inferencing part of microworld models,which is usually their raison dletre, but: only to their interfadewith natural language input, The designers of such models areinclined to regard the input analysis as little more than atedious chore, and would be unllikely to take exception to what Iam saying since they themselves normally make no great claimsfox this part of their models.
But ethers, commenting on themoaels, sometimes m a e  exaggerated claims on behalf of theanalysers, and these claims should be guarded against.
PerhapsChe relationship between a language and a t$ny subset of it witha stric*t;ly limited number of features should be thought of asakin to the relationship between a wall and a stone.
They arerecognisably composed of the same substance, but one hasessential characteristics which the other totally.lacks.Before leaving the shbjsa~t of multi-dimensionality, 1 wouldlike to touch briefly on the possibility, at some time in thefuture, of devising a standard method of determinine the extentof a subset of a language.
The following idea could be considered,probably to be rejected, but at least it could provide a starting-point for discussion, A fiumber of features, say n, could bedecided upon, the number varying according to the degree ofsubtlety of delineation required.
An n-dimensional array withn+l columns in each dimension (fbr the n featul~es + 1 blank)would then contain an element corresponding to ewbry combinationof these features.
Some of these qlements would be irr~levant,since they would represent impossible combinations.
The validelements could be filled or not, according to whether tHe subsetcontained the combination of features which they represented.For a programmer building up the subset which his program wascapable of analysing, such an array could provide both a measureof achievement and a guide to what was missing.To return now to the analogy of the puddle, the secondrespect in which it was incomplete Ftas that a program, as itdevelops, b e s  not advmce continuously, like water spreading,but by fits and starts, in discrebe steps.
Suppose, for example,that a programmer is testing a particurar feature like, say,relative clauses, as that is the feature we have previouslydiscussed.
Sentences containing relative clauses Uave beenentered repeatedly, and each time they have been rejected oranalysed inco~rectly.
Then at last comes the moment of triumphand relief when, for the first time, the program takes in sucha sentence and analyses it c'orrectly.
At that moment, theprogram has not merely edged forward, but it has leapt.
Interms of the array postulated in the last paragraph, not just onebut several elements will in all probability have been covered inone step.
It will not be known for certain which elements, untilmore testing has been done and more sentences tried.
B U ~  justas it would be ludicrous to suppose that because a program cananalyse one relative clause it can analyse all, i.t would beequally ludicrous not to edpect a program which can analyse onerela-t;ive clause to be able to analyse at least some others.There is a section of program common to all relative clauses,which has to work before any can be ana~ysed correctly, and oncethat section is wox3cing jn combination with ~anp feaeures, theliklghood is that it will work in combination with at least someothers.What follows from this?
Firstly, that no reliable methodat present exists for the designer of a language model ?0delineate the subset of language which his model can analyse,.Secondly, that desi"rab1e as it undoubtedly is, for the benefitof both the designers of models and those who seek to assesstheir scope, to devise such a method, it is going to be extremelydifficult to do so.
Thirdly, that in this unfortunate state ofaffairs a designer can but fall back on the established system ofpresenting a list of sentepces which his program has analysedcorrectly, and leave it to the reader to make his- own assessmentof where the bounds of the subset analysable by the model lie.To discuss the sentences as simply a few examples would be un-intelligent; equally unintelligent to see in them visions ofuniversal.ity.
Where, between these two extremes, the reader'sjudgement falls should depend upon the variety of the sent-ences,and upon their complexity.
If the program can" deal withcomplexity in any area, it should be some indication of its power,perhaps yet unrealised, to do so in other areas, It would be asign of its versatility, of its ability to disentangle elaboratepat* ern3 and resolite them into their elementary cornporls~lt s .After - k h i s  r a t h w  prolix introduction, 1 eorrle eventually tomy own "Pist of ssntenc\@st1 ellat have been successftrlly annlyssdby CLAM.
They fall into two categqries: those which have beentranglat~d into French, in which case the Frexic$l translation isgiven; and those which have sirtiply been analysed sylt actically,and semantically and reduced to a base form.
Tliis 1s  becausedurfng the last year 1 have not been working on the Frenchgenerator but concentrating on certain asyects of the ana1yser;-and so in order to save computer time, the French seneration hasbeen omitted, Thus the sentenceswithout translation have beenprocessed last.The question arises of what exactly is meant by "analwedsyntactically and semantically" and "reduced to base form".
T h swill be more fully explained in the subsequent test.
At this,stage a"t  is sufficient to say that a syntactic tree has been formedand serntxntic ambiguities resolved, and that semantic relationsbetr3een words in the tree have been determined ( e .
g .
a syntacticsubject of a passive verb is recorded as the semantic object).Singre word meanings are retained as basic units.
There is noSchankian-type resolutiun lnto semantic primitives, e x c e p t  inso-far as this is implicit in the classification system.
This isthe base form from which the French has been generated.
It hasno% so far proved necessary to go any baser.
Development, aswill be explained later, is envisaged along the lines of extendingthe network rather than breaking down the units.SAMPLE SENTENCESThe follow3.ng are samples of sentences which have beencorrectly anaW8ed by the program.

In afield in which vast amounts are being written, it is a properself-defence on the part of the reader, but in A.1.
in part-icular, it has its special dangers.When one passes from the realm of pure ideas to the- ,hardpracticalities of writing a computer program, a subtle changeof emphasis occurs, The ideas, all embracing they may haveseemed at their inception, recede into the background, andwhat becoma vital are the details, the tiny mosaic pieceswhich determine whether the program succeeds.
To Judge acomputer program by a crude classification ofi its metl~od islike judging a picture by saying that it is impressionistic.Certainly it ; is impressionistic, but is it any good?In case the reader is not convinced by t'his argument,let me say immediately that this is a multiple-path, single-pass, left-to-right, word-by-word analyser, akin to themultiple-path analyser of Oettinger and the augmentedtransitiofi~networ grammar of Woods.
In order to tackle thesemantics, and indeed also the syntactics, the meanings ofwords have been coded according to a hierarchical taxonomyThat they are coded has been largely dictated by the demandsof FORTRAN, in which the program is written, although somesystem more overtly !Like a networ could have been used.
Thatthe classification should be essentially hierarchical, withcertain necesgary refinements, has always seemed obvious.Some details of how the program works now follow.
I willstart wikh the syntactic and semantic analysis, and come laterto the generation of the French.find codesFLOWCHARTsyntactic and semantic analysis FrenchREDUCTION O F  THE PASSAGE TO BASE FORMA glance at the flowchart on the preceding page showsthat there are two main parts of the program: first, thesingle subroutine READ, and second, a,group of subroutinescomprising t h ~  syntactic and semantic analysis.READ This subroutine first transgers the base form of-the ppeceding sentence to semi-permanent store.
Then ~treads the next sentence.
It looks up each word in thedictionary file (VOCAB).
If it cannot find it at first, ittests for-certain endings such as -s, -ed, and -ing, subtractsthem and tries again.
When it finds the word it stores allthe possible codes which are associated with the word inVOCAB.
It also assembles compounds such as 'in front of1,'in order tot, or infinitives, for which there is no singlecode, Proverbs or cliches can be 'similarly treated.Coding Every possible rheaning of a word has a codenumber containing a maximum of twelve digits.
These codenumbergs are stored with the word in VOCAB and extracted inREAD, The coding is based on a straightforward classification.2 1 1 1For example the code of 'bull' is6 2 I noun concrete creature maleSuch classification is essential to reduceanimal farm cowthe number of syntactic and semantic patterns which have to beBstored.
It may be noted in passing that the system of codingcontains the elements of both syntactic and semantic class-ification.
The distinction between the two is at tlmes tenuous.Further explanation of the coding is given in the appendix.Syntactic and Semantic Analysis This is Ohe mostcomplicated part of the model, and comprises several sub-routines.
For ease of explanation, many of them are heretreated as parts of the larger routines CON, UPDT and OACR.As the flowchart shows, these three routines operate inturn on each word of' a sentence, and when the end of thesentence is reached, a fourth routine, ENDR, is called on tooperate on the complete sentence .Before giving some account of the functions of theseroutines, it is necessary to explain the term EP, and todescribe JEP and JSP, the two principle files referred t o  inthis part of the program.EP ( ~ n ~ l i s h  pattern).
Take the sentence, The man with a-long nose always snores.
The program breaks this down intofour EPs, as follows:EP 1 EP 2 EP 3 EP 4lead word snores man with nosesubsidiary word man the nose asubsidiary word always with longA n  EP contains one lead word plus a number of subsidiaries,and is classified according to the nature of the lead word.Thus W 1 is a verb EP, EPs 2 and 4 are noun EPs, and EP 3 isa preposition EP.
Man, the lead word of EP2, is a subsidiaryof EP 1 ,  so EP 2 is dependent on EP 1.
Similarly, EP 3 isdepenaent on EP 2, and EP 4 on EP 3.
Splitting a sentence intoEPs is simply forming it into a tree structure.snores/ \a longJEP This file contains the templates for all the different--t;ypes of EP.
FOT example the template for a noun EP containsvarious types of adjective in appropriate sequence, These arefollowed by the lead novn.
This is then followed byadjectives, appositional nouns, prepositions and relative pro-nouns.
In an EP certain positions, such as the lead, arenecessary, while others are optional.
In a noun EP, the onlynecessary position is the lead noun.
In a preposition EP,besides the lead preposition, the following noun is necessary.By far the most compliCated EP is of course the verb EP.
Inthis EP, later positions can be either closed, or opened, ormade necessary, by a particular class of word in a particularposi'tibn.
For example, a pre-verb subject closes a fiost-verbsubject.
A question verb makes a post-verb subject necessary.One class of verbs opens a subsequent gerund position andcloses a subsequent infinitive, Once an EP has bean started,the program tests to see if the next word could occupy anopen posi$ion on the template as far as the next necessaryposition (cf.
below).
Note that these templates are of syntacficpatterns and bear no relation to Wilkst semantic templates.JSP This file contains all the semantic patterns (SPS).-An example of an SP is 12119 21 21102.
This means that allverbs whose codes start with the digits 12119 can have assubjects any nouns whose codes start with the digits 21102.More specifically, it means that human beings read1 or write.In this case the verb would be the lead of a verb EP, and thenoun would be a subsidiary word in the subject position of theEP.
The middle group of digits in the SP specify the relation-ship between subsidiary and the lead.
In this case, 21specifies subject of verb.
Similarly, SPs govern the relation-ships between the lead verb and all other subsidiary positionsin the verb EP, and between lea9 and subsidiaries of all theother EPs.
For example, 621 2 226 means that time prepositions,whose code words start with the digits 621, can have as objectsany time nouns whose codes start with digits 226.
When decidingwhether a word is acceptable in a subsidiary position of aparticular EP, a,semantic match is made between that word andthe lead word: JSP is searched to see if an SP exists permit-ting that word to be associated in that subsidiary positionwith that lead wofd (cf.
below).Processing the Sentence The sentence is processed in asingle pass word by word from left to right.
After each word,a number of possible continuation paths are open.
The nextword is tested along each of these paths, and if no place canbe found for it that path is closed.
If no placescan be found,the path is reproduced n-1 times and the word added to each pathEach path may then have one or more  continuation^,Let us now return to th8 sentence, The man with a long nosealways snores.
The program goe's through the sentqnce word byword, starting from the first.
At the beginning, a verb EPis llapentl, Thak is to say, the program loodcs for all posltiqnswhich could start a verb EP which the first word satisfies.
Inthis case, 'the1 cannot be part of a verb El?, but only of anoun EP, so the program will skart a noun LP which is dependenton the subject position of a verb EP.
The next word 11iustcontinua the noun EP.
Therefore on going to the next word,only EP2 is "open".
,'Many is then read, and EP2 and also EP1<are updated.
At this point there are two alternativecontinuations.
Either EP2 could be continued, as in fact happens,or EP2 could be  closed" and EP1 continued.
Therefore on goingto the next word, EPs 1 aqd 2 are both open.
So the process iscontinued through the sentence.As shown in the flowchart, there are three subroutines whichoperate on each word--CON, UPIX and OACR.CON takes each EP which is open, and tests each sense of the-word against each possible continuation of the EP.
If the wordcould satisfy a position, it then looks to see whether a formmatch is necessary.
In general, in English, a form test is onlynecessary between subject and verb, when the number and personmust agree.
If this hurdle is overcome, CON then proceeds to asemantic match.
In general, the lead word of an EP must bematched semantically with every subsidiary word of that EP.For example a sub"jct must' be matched with a verb.
So i% checkis performed, to see if that particular noun taken in thatparticular sense could be the subject of that particular verbtaken in that particular sense.
Having found all the possiblesolutions, CON then gives way to UPDT.UPDT updates each EP according to the solutions found inCII_CON.
It reproduces EPs as necessary where more than onesolution has Been found, and discards EPs which have becornedefunct because no solution has been found.
It also determineswhich lqter positions of' an EP either can or m u s t  be filled asa result of the current word becoming a part of the EP.
T t  L l l e nhands over to OACR.OACR (open and Close ~outine) determines which EPs must-be kept for the next word.
It also perforrns somejuggling with EPs in certain rather tricky cases such asrelative clauses.
It then returns control to the root PTOgXaInfor the next word.When all the words of the sentence have been processed,ENDR is entered.
This examines all existing solutions.
Itdiscards any that are incomplete, and perfornls sorne housekeepingon those which: are complete in order to separate them, Infuture, it will make a choice between alternative solutions,although this part of the program has not yet been written.After ENDR, the sentence has been reduced to one (or more)sets of connecked EPs.
Within an EP, for each subsidiary wordthe relationship to the lead word ( eg.
verb/ob j e c t  , verb/time-noun, noun/article, etc.)
is specified, as are the code(s)remaining as a result of the semantic matches which that wordhas undergone during the analysis.After  t h i s  b r i e f  d e s c r i p t i o n  of t h e  func t ions  of t he  va r ioussubrout i l ies ,  a Inore d e t a i l e d  explanat ion of t h e  s e m m t i c  matchfo l lows.

There could be t w o  reasons:  e i t h e r  that theconcept of the preposition changes (which is probably nottrue here),.or that the tranaIation is different in spmetarget language.
If it is only the second case, thedistinctian could have been left for the ,program whichgeneratds the target languwe to draw.
However, it is moreeconomical to deal with it @ring the semantic ntatching.Now let us see how the disambiguation procoas works.This example is simplified because it does not shaw thesemantib matching acTOSS prepositions, between 'walked1 and'fields1, and between 'walked1 and 'Mayt.
Although sometimesnecessary for complete disambiguation, it is not so in thisexample, and as i .4;  complicates the explanation, I will omlt ithere for the sake of simplicity,After the second word, there is only one EP open.Cbde range(?
?he meaning of "codeEP 1 lead w d k  2-2range1* w i l l  appearsubject she 1 - 1  prgsently.
)The thipd word, i n 1 ,  has two syntactic classes, ad'verbor preposition.
Both are acceptable at this point in the verbEP.
So a semantic match is performed between each class of'in' and the lea4 word ' w a l k ' .Suppose that one SP gives 114 5 52,another gives 1 1 6 62,and another gives 1 1  6 63.A l l  the codes of 'in' are accepted-- code 4 by the first SP,codes 5, 6 and 7 by the second SP, and codes 8 and 9 by the thirdThe EP has to be reproduced because there are two syntacticclasses of 'in'.
We therefore have the following:code range code rangesEP 1 lead walk 2-2 EP2 lead walk 2-2 2-2subject she 1 - 1  subject she 1 - 1  1 - 1adverb in 4- 4 preposition in 5-7 819in EP2 there are two code ranges, one f o r  r;he place prepositionand one for the t i n i s  prepositiong.
EP3, a preposition EPattackled to EP2, is now opened, and for the next w o r d  thispreposition EP and EP1 are open, but EP2 is closed,The next word, 'fields', is a place noun.
It is notaccepted in EP1, which is therefore disca-rded.
It is accewtedin EP3 as the object of the preposition, so a sernantlc match ISperformed between 'in1 and 'fields',Suppose there is an SP, 62 2 2127, Codes 5-7 are thenaccepted by this SP, and EP3 then looks like this:code rangeEP 3 lead in 5-7object< field 10-10A reconciliation is now carried out between the codes of 'infin EP3 and EP2, As a result, the second code range in EP2 1 selirninat ed.The next word, 'in1 again, IS now read, and the process isrepeated, EP2 now looks like this:lead walk 2-2 2-2subject she 1-1 1 - 1preposition in 5- 7 5-7preposition in 12-14 15-16This time, on 'May', the relevant SP is 6311 2 2235.There would also be an SP like this: 63 2 223.But the first SP gives a narrower code range (16-16 insteadof 15-16), and so it is preferred.
This time, on recgnciliation,the first code range in EP2 is eliminated and the second isreduced.
So at the end, the three EPs are thus:EP2 lead walk 2-2 EP3 lead in 5-7 E P ~  lead in 16-16subject she 1 - 1  object fields 10-10 object May 17-17preposition in 5-7preposition in 16- 16We are now left with a code range for the first 'in1containing three codes, In such eases, it is the first code ofthe range which 1 s  selected.
So 'in' has been dlsambfguated to621 in the first case, and tg 6311 in the second.Syntactic Complexities Of course, it is all very well fora program to be able to digest, She walked in fields in May.But can it also cope with this?The farmers we were talking about grew, and the green-grocers, thieves and liars, sold those apples.In other words, the program must be capable of being expandedto deal with the myriad complexities and exceptions of naturallanguage.
However sound the principles underlying a programmay be, such expansion involves a deal of intricate anddetaiJ.ed work.
At every stage,, flexibility and rigidity liaveto be balmced.
The program must be flexible enough tae'nvisage possibilities, but rigid enough to exclude im-possibilities and to latch onto the right solution when itappears.
The programmer's task resembles a tailor's.
Let outan inch or two mare, taka in a couple thore.
It .c~.ould besatisfactory inaeed if an algorithm could be Pound both conciseand comprehensive which would encompass all the requirements,but language is such a barnacled growth that this seems on theface of it improbable, It would be surpri.sing if excrescencesin the program were not necessary to deal with excrescences inthe language.
In the development of this program, when thetreatment of a new structure has been added, whenever possiblethe original framework has been adapted to incorporate it,thereby avoid~ng the necessity of adding large sections ofprogram.
This is only commonsensical.
Nevertheless, the programhas grown considerably with its c~pacity to handle largerareas oflanguage.Here is perhaps a suitable point to emphasise that, sincethis is a multiple-path analyser', at sach point all the avail-able information, syntact'ic and semantic, has been deployed toeliminate incorrect paths.
This has been done not only toavoid unnecessary computatian, but also because the storagelimits have made i$ essential.
There are only 25 EPs.
Frequentlyduring testing this store overflowed, but interestingly enough~t has always been possible to bring the demand on it backwithin bounds by finding some restriction which had been over-looked and which cut out one of the paths.
It had originallybeen feared that 25 EPs would not be nearly enough.
One ofthe satisfying discoveries of the program is that it'i.3.Of course the deployment of all available information isnod &he only approach.
Most of the earlier program concentratedon the syntax and paid little heed to the semantics.
Wilks,on the other hand, is relying primarily on the semantics suzdis tbaking from the syntax only what is absolutely necessary.It will be fascinating if his research is able to deternineexackly how much of the syntax is unnecessary.
There are obviousredundancies in the form of unnecessary safe-guards in language,No one who has struggled with German case endings is ignorantof this, In English, we have the concord between subject andverb in the third perSbn of the present, patently unnecessarysince it exists only in this one instance, There are manysentences in which the semantics alone are clearly sufficient.In the sentence, "The man ate the steak with a fork,", the wordscould appear in any sequence and the meaning would be decipherable,although it might take longer to decipher.
The interestingquestion is what features of the syntax can be consistentlyignored, without occasional sentences cropping up which can onlybe deciphered with the help of these features.There now follows a description of the treatment of threenotoriotisly awkward problems-- relative clauses, pronouns, andconjunction.Relative Clauses Six cases are distinguished:1.
The man who met you.
5.
The man you met..
The man who(m) you met.
6.
The man you gave it to.3.
The rnan who (m) you gave it to.4, The man to whom you gave it.After the lead of a noun EP, a relative pronoun (94), a pre-position ( 6 ) ,  and a contact noun ( 2 ~ )  are all possiblecontinuations.lWhol has three relative pronoun codes, starting with,941, subject of relative clause,942, object of relative clause,943, object of prepositicm in relative clause,-'Whom' ~bviously only has the last two.EP1 man EP2 man EP3 man E P ~  ---the the the (man) (subject)who 9-41 who 942 who 943EP5 --- EP~--A EP7 ---(a) (object) --- (man) (preposition object)When a relative pronoun is recognised, the noun EP, EP1,is reproduced to EPs 2 and 3, and the codes 941, 942, and 943 aretoadded to separate noun EPs.
Then in OACR, new EPs 4 6 areopened dependent uppn the noun EPs.
In the case of 941 and 942,the lead of the noun EP, *mant, is Bntered in the neQ EPs,assubject and objec-k respectively.
They are marked so as to avoidtranslation, but they are necessary for semantic matching inthe relative clause.
In the case of 943, an additional newpreposition EP, EP7, is opened dependent upon the relativeclause EP, and the lead of the noun EP, 'man', is entered asthe object of this prepositiatn EP.
The relative clause EPis marked as waiting for a fldating preposition, although whena preposition comes this EP is reproduced, and in one EP thepreposition is taken as the floating preposition, while in theother EP it i s  talcen as a n o t h e r  preposition.
This is necessaryto allow for such clauses as, the man wliom you g a v e  tile bookin the end to.In the cases  of 941, 942 and 943, the only EP which is openfor the next word is the relative clause EP.
For 941 the nextnecessary word in the EP is the lead verb, while for 942 and 943the next necessary word is the subject.
In practice, one orm o r e  of these EPs is usually eliminated on the next word.When a contact noun is recognised, it is marked i n  the nounEP as being in reality a relative pronoun.
Then the procedurefor 942 and 943 above is followed; but in addition, the contactnoun is entered as the subject of the relative clause EP.When a prepusition is recognised, the noun EP is reproducedonce, because the preposition might be in the noun EP, like dogin a manger, or it might be in a relative clause.
For therelative clause path, a preposition EP and a relative clause EPare opened.
Only the preposition EP is left open for the nextword, which must be a relative pronoun,For indirect questions,I don't know which house he bought.I don't know what he lived in.
etcthe treatment is somewhat similar to that for relative clauses.Pronouns For either a translation or a questio~l-a~isweri~lgprogram, the noun which the pronoun replaces, called here thereplacement noun, has to be identified.
In a question-allawering program, the reasons are obvious enough.
I n  atranslation progrml, it is necsssary for sertiantic ~natchlng andalso because in many target languages the gender of the prohounvaries with that of the replacement noun.The replacement noun might; be in the same sentence as thepronoun, or in a previous sentence.
Therefore, in dealing withpronouns, the program must be able to refer to precedingsentences.
So after ENDR, the essential information for thesentence just processed is extracted from the first chain ofEPs and stored.
At present, th$s is only done for one chain ofE P s ,  i,e.
one solution.
This essential information consistsof a tree, containing one code for each word and the relatlonof each word to the code to which it is attached.

The previous column contains any relationshipinformation not implicit in the code itself or, in the caseof a pronoun, a pointer to the code of the replacement noun,1% is important to notice that the code itself usually doesprovide the relationship information.
For example 61, thefirst two digits of 'witht, specify with some precision therelationship of 'witht to 'man',With the preceding sentences available in this form, theprocessing of a pronoun works as fo1;lows.
When the pronounis first encountered for a semqntic match, all the possimereplacement nouns are found; that is to say, all those nounswhich agree in number and person with the pronoun and whichare either before the pronoun in the same sentende but not inthe same clause, or in a preceding.sentence.
The program onlygoes back through the preceding sentences until suitablenoun has been found, If for example there w e r B  one or moresuitable nouns in the second sentence before the current one,38it would not examine the third sentence besore the currentone.
Consider the following sentences.The man went into the shop where he had seen the raincoat.He bought a hat an4 took it away.For 'het, the only possible replacement noun is 'man' becauseit is the only noun which agrees in person.
For i t ,  theprogram firids 'hat1, 'raincoatt, and 'shopt as possible re-placement nouns, If there were a preceding sentence, itwould not bother to search it.
Semantic matches are thencarried out between 'take' and each of the three nouns and allthree nouns are accepted, so they are all entered into theEP after i t .
But the code ranges for 'shop' are morerestricted than for 'hat1 and 'raincoat1, because the physical-movement meaning of 'taker is excluded with 'shopt because'shopt is imrnoveable.
When 'away' is read and matched with'taket, all meanings of 'take' except the physical-movementmeaning are eliminated.
tShopt is now left dangling, so tospeak, and is eliminated as a possible replacement noun.
Sowhen the end of the sentence is reached, there are two possibleswviving replacement nouns, 'hat' and 'raincoat'.
There isno semantic reason for preferring one of these to the other,becaase the number of digits matched in the semantic matchwith 'take' is the same in both cases.
Therefore in ENDR achoice is made according to a formula of priorities and 'hattis selected, as; a rmre recent verb object.This "formula of prioritiesv, which is only applied ifthere is no semantic preference for one noun, is probably at3 9the moment .a rather blunt instrumeat.
It is concerned withtwo factors -- which noun occurred in a 1-ater clause, andwhich noun has the same function as the pronoun; subject,objept, preposition object, or object of the same preposition.In the majority of cases it produces the correct answer, butit is possible to think up examples in which it doesn't.With experience of use, the formula will be refined.A complication is addea ~y rhe possibility that, when asubdect, 'itt may be impersonal.
This sense is treatedessentially as one possible replacement noun.There is still work to be done in developing the for,mulaof priorities.
CLAM extracts the information required tosolve the pronoun problem.
The question is, how to use it.Conjunction No m t  of the program is more complex thanthat dealing with conjunct'fon.
The principles are clear,Qevensimple, enough; but applying them has demanded a considerableamount of care.
Consider the fragment,He cleaned the carpets in the bedroom and......When 'and1 is read, the EPs are as follows:EPI cleaned EP2 carpets EP3 in E P ~  bedroomhe the bedroom thecarpets inAll four of these EPs are alive, which is to say that the nextword might be a continuation of any of them.
On recognisinga conjunction, the program looks for nnssible continuations inall alive EPs, from the beginning of the EP up to the pointwhich has been reached.
It carries out the necessary semanticmatches, it opens a new "conjeptt or conjunctive EP for eachsolution, and it enters dummy words in both the conjep andthe EPs above it in the chain where necessary.
To clarifythis prooedure, we will consider two possible continuations.
(a) ..... and I...... '1' can only be the subject of averb EP, so the conjep., EP5, must be joined to EP1.
Theprogram adds a 5(: entry, and opens EP5 thus:EP1 cleaned EP5-----carpets EP5 is dependent on EPI at the subjectpositionK 5(b) ..... and curtains.
'Curtainsf could be joined toEP2 as the lead, or J S Y ~  as the object.
The conjep ISattached to the lower EP, EP2, but a dummy word is enteredin EP1 and the semantic match is carried out between thedummy word, 'curtains', and the lead of the  EP, 'cleanedt,EP1 cleaned EP2 carpets EP5 curtainshe the theXcarpets inEP5 is dependent on EP2 at theXcurtains K 5  lead position,'The1 r is entered as a dummy word in EP5 because it comes beforethe point at which EP5 is dependent on EP2.
A semantic matchis carried out be%w;een 'thev and 'curtainst.
'CurtainsT might also be the subject of a verb EP, soEPI is reproduced and another conjep started, attached to thereproduced EP at -%he subject position, as for.....and I......aboqe.
This path is unlikely to be correct, and will probablysoon b~ eliminated,An attempt is also made to attach curtainst to E P ~  inthe lead position, but it fails because a dummy wordcurtainsi is then put into EP3, and the semantic matchbetween 'int and 'curtains1 is tried +and fails,Now let us see what the EPs 1ookd.ike at the end of amore complex conjunctive sentence:I, you and Nellie saw, watched and greeted the men,women and tired children.EPI saw EP2 I EP5 watched E P ~  greeted EP7 menI K 3  the~4~ X youX YOU K8~ e 1 l i .
e ~  EP3 you   el lie^   el lie^ 1c9K 5  ~4 ~6 men EP8 women X~6 E P ~  Nellie X X men women theXXmen women childi-enx KgXwomen childrenX EP9 childrentiredIt will be seen that control passes from the conjeps 5and 6 up to EP1 before 'men', so that 'men' is entered as aword in EPI.
B u t  it is also entered as a dummy word in EPs5 and 6, and semantic matches are carried out with 'watched1and 'greeted1.
Also 'woment and 'children', although onlydummy words in EPI, are entered as dummy words in EPs 5 and6 as well,A c ~ n j e p  remains open, and the EP ofi which it depends42remains closed until the last necessary word up to the branchhas been filled.
If the sentence had read,1 you and Nellie saw, and 'he1 watched and greeted.,etc.EP5 would have opened with 'he'.
I ,  'you1 and 'Nellie1 wouldnot have been entered i n  it as durnrny W Q ~ ~ S .
E l ?
would flclvoremained open, and EP1 closed until arter tho lead w ~ r dtwa-l;chedlmA c o m a  is treated as a possible conjunction or as FIpossible braclcst.
Bocauso of the dual  r o l e  o f  c.i corntrln, tllcprogramming associated with it is rather awlc~qard .To sum up the treatment o f  conjunction, the possiblecontinuations from a conjunction, particularly if'there havebeen previous conj~mctions in the sentence, can be numerous.But by the strict use of dumrriy entries and their associatedsemantic matches, false continuat~ons are usually quicklynosed out and eliminated.
Also, f o r  the recordirlg of thefull meaning of a corij~uictive senterice for-  tho purpose oflater interrogation, the dummy entry system is of courseessential.
And in the special case of comparative sente~~ces,it is only by such a system that it can be clearly establishedexactly what is being compared.Summary.
I conclude this section with an assessment of whatthe analysis can and cannot achieve.
The purpose of analysismight be described as follows: to select, from among all thepossible meanings of each word in the passage, its correctmeaning in the context, and t o  determine what semanticrelationships exist between '~qhich words, CLAN can do thzswith considerable efficiency within the confines of 9 singlesentence.
It is just beginning to enlarge its horizens todeal with longer texts.To clarify this statement let us consider the aids whichenable us to select one meaning of a word raeher than another,and see which of them CLAM applies.1.
Syntactic class.
Example: "The car will work whenthe mechhic finishes his wo'rlc.
Here tho word 'worlc' isevidehtly a verb on the first occasion and 3 noun on thesecond.
CLAM can usually deal easily enough with this type ofambiguity.2.
Rules for pronoun antecedents, This has already beendiscussed at some length..
The rules are both semantic andsyntactic.
When the rules are determined, CLAM will be in aposition to apply th6m.3.
Semantic restrictions on syntactically associated pairsof'words which exclude one meaning.
Example: "He took off hisg~andmother.~ Here the two word verb 'take offt mugt me-'mimicl.
The personal subject and the existence of an objectexcludes the sense of a plane taking off, 'Grandmother1 asobject excludes the sense of taking off clothes, Suchrestrictions are the basis of CLAM'S semantic match, andambiguities of this sort are resolved as a matter of course.4.
Semantic restrictions on syntactically associatedpairs of words khich give preference to one meaning.
Example:"I killed ths man with a gun."
Here, there is a synta~tic aswell as a semantic ambiguity.
It is less straightforward thanthe previous example because the ambiguous word is 'with',whlch might be ~JI instrument preposition attached to the verbkill1, or a possessicon preposition attached to the nounVrnanl.
The semantic relationships which determine the choice,however, ~ n l y  involve 'witht i n d l  ectly.
They are between 'kill1and 'gun1 in one case, and between 'man1 and 'gun1 in theother, NormalLy tlXle preference would be for the instrunlent;interpretation because l g ~ p l '  is more strongly associated with'killt as an instrument than with 'man1 as a possession.
CLISrcIchooses the stronger association by taking the 'deepertsemadtic match, ar 2n other words the match involving theLarger number of digits.
It does this correctly, but as w eshall see in a moment, it is not always correct to do so,5, Remoter contextual environment.
Sometimes thefactors enabling a choice to be made are more remote from theword in question than In the examples given above, In orderto find these factors, a longer journey has to be made intothe environment of the word,Examples: (i) "The mayor hit the alderman so hard that hefell down."
The normal rules for selection of pronotinantecedents would prefer 'mayor' as the antecedent of 'he'because it is the subjec-tt, but in the environment of hitting,it is much more likely to be the person hit who falls downrather than t b  hitter, so 'alderman' must be preferred.
(ii) "Two men came in.
One had a gun and tho other hada knife.
I killed the man with a gun."
Here 'withT isobviously not an instrument preposition attached to lkilll,but a possession preposition attached to 'menv.
This is sobecause the definite article 'thet attached to vmpn' impliesthat 'man1 has already been defined, But in fact two menhave already been defined, and more information is needed todetermine which of them is referred to.
The only possibleadditional information which could satisfy this requirementis 'with a gunr, whioh does suffice to distinguish one of thepreviously determined men.
Therefore this phrase must beattached to 'manv,At present, CLAM could not resolve either sf theseambiguities.
In order to do so it would need, in the fix"stcase, more information about the environment of 'hitt thanis contained in the semantic restrictions now at itsdisposal, and i n  the second case, both a better memory and aroutine for dealing with definition of nouns.
Work is inprogress on these vital additions.
They will involveadding to the type and range of the semantic relationshipsbetween pairs of words referred to in the definition of thepurpose of analysis given at the beginning of this summary.At present, CLAM only holds semantic relationships be-tweenwords which are syntactically related.
This is not enough.Adding to the types of relationships held, and extending themto pairs of words which are syntactically remote, will greatlyincrease the scope of the model.GENERATION OF TFIE FIXENCFI TRANSLATIONAs shown in the flowchart, the sentence is operated onsequentially by four subroutines--TWEN, ITRN, FRORM andPRIN.
Briefly the function of each of these subroutinesis as follows.TWEN examines all the verbs.
It welds them (joinsauxiliaries to main verbs), and determines their tense inFrench.
Thls is not of course necessarily the sane as inEnglish.
Other features of the sentence often have to beexamined.
Thus, "When he arrives we will meet him", becomesin French, "When he will arrive we will meet him".
And"I have been here for five years" becomes "I am here sincefive years.!!
Gerunds, infinitives and participles are alsodealt with by T W E N ,  It may well be asked why the weld partof this routine is thus left until the French generation.Should it not be done avring the reduction of the Englishsentence to base fo'rm?
The answer is that logically itshould, and it will sooner or later be transferred, probablyto ENDR.
But at present it doesn't matter.
The part of theprogram described in the section on pronouns which stores thebase form of the last sentences is in fact performed after theFrench translation has been generated, and therefore, afterthe verbs have been welded.ITRN takes each word in the sentence in turn.
I;t findsthe code number in FRILE, the French dictionary file, andextracts the French word(s).
Sometimes of course there ismore than one, Sometimes there is zero because the Englishword does not have to be translated.
Any particular Frenchword may not have the same function in the sentence as theEnglish word.
In such cases, the French word entry in FRILEis followed by a code which specifies the word's function inx'glation to the English word being translated.
For example,if 2.32237 isl the code for 'potato', -t;hen'FR1LE entry will be212237 POMME F DE 6 TERRE 6x2.
The F after POMME shows thatit is feminine.
The 6 after DE shows that its x'unc$ion is asa plcepqsition in the EP of which POMME is the lead.
The 6x2after T E W  shows that it is the object in the EP of which DEis the lead,Sometimes it isaecessary to go up Che tree.
Fop exampleY1x5 means an adverb (5) in the verb EP (1) of which theEnglish word is a subsidiary ( Y ) .
It is thus possible togenerate a French sentdnce of a radically different shape fromEnglish.ITRY also finds a French sequence code for each word.This is a code which provides the ordering of words within anEP.
All lead words have the code 200.
A pre-noun adjectivemay have a code 140, and a post-noun adjective 350.
So thesecodes do not determine what is the actual sequence of wordsin the sentence, but they do provide the basic informationfrom which the sequence is derived in FRORM.FRORM first derives the actual sequence of words in %he,sentence.
It then takes each French word and puts it into thecorrect rorrn.
Obviously the most arduous part of this tqskis finding the forms of the verbs.
FRORM refers to tableswhich contain the verb endrings for both irregular b d  regularverbs, and the irregular feminine and plural endings fornouns and adjectives.PRIN prints the French translation, haying made any-necessary elisions.
If there is more than one solution, itprints alterna-bive translations of particular words on sub-sequen.1; linss or, if appropriate, it will print completealternative sentences.CONCLUSIONProgramming Details and Future DevelopmentsProgrammersmay be interested in some details.
The programruns on a 360-40 using 1 4 6 ~  of core store.
The program ism i t t e n  in FORTRAN IV, not an ideal choice but the bestavailable in the circumstances.
The reduction of the Englishto base form requires about 6,000 instructions, and the Frenchgeneration about 2,500.
At present all the files are 1cep-kin core store except for the two large dictionary files VOCABand FRILE, which are accessed on disk.
It will eventually benecessary to Keep JSP also on disk.At present the processing takes about 15 seconds per wordon average, of which READ takes 4076, the semantic andsyntactic analysis about 20%, and the French generation 40%.No serims attempt has y e t  been made to optimise the program andthis time could certainly be peduced.
But the reduction wouldbe offset by the eventual need to keep JSP on disk.
So asa practical proposition for translating texts, it would benecessary for the processing time to be reduced by a factorof about 10.
Presumably this will come sooner or later withimprovement in hardware.There are certain improvements which would have -bo bemade to the pogram before it could be used, apart from theextension of the vocabulary.
Most obvious:(a) there are some syntactic structures such asinversion after negatives which the program doesnot at present recognise;(b) a, selection routine must be incorporated in ENDRto choose between alternative solutions if morethan one emerges;(c) if no solution emerges the program should tryagain, selectively suppressing semantic matching,allowing words to be used outside their normal sense;(d) the sizes of some of the temporary stores wouldhave to be increased.No particular dirficulty is anticipated with any of thesedevelopments, in that they involve no methodology fundamentallydifferent from what has already been applied.
It is primarilya matter of time and priorities.
However with a fifth develop-ment, namely the extension of the memory as outlined at theend of the section o h  analysis, new ground must be covered,and work on this is at present in progress.APPENDIXCoding System : Principal Categori,esD i g k t  I s t1 verb2 noun3 pr,onoun4 adjective2nd 3rd1 intransi-tive2 noun object3 clause predicate I noun + part part.2 noun + to + i n f i n .3 noun + gerund5 noun clause4 verb sequel5 noun + clausepredicate6 complement sequel7 be (pres.

FEDERAL PRQCUREMENT FOR RESEARCH AND DEVBLOPMENT: ANEXPLANATION OF THE RFP CONTRACT MECHANISMEach year the federal government contracts for billions of dollars of work tosupport efforts deemed to  be in the national interest.
A significant percentage of the contractservices are in the form of Research and ~eve lopment  (R & D) or programmatic work whichcolleges and universities are particularly wcll-suited to  perform.
The government commits thesefunds i n  eithet of two WAYS: grants or contracts.University researchers are generally more familiar with the grant procedure than withthe contract procedure.
Under a grant program, a given federal agency is authorized to grantfunds to non-profit institutions, frequently educational institutions, for the purpose of supportingresearch or a in a given general area.
A body of general conditions are established bythe Congress and refined by the applicable agency to  set parameters for the pro$am as a whole.A specific grant for a program can be made so long as it fits within the gevral stpndards (theGuidelines) of the program and meets whatever qualitative standards for review that  have beenestablished.Since grant funds, particularly in research areas, have been inc~asingly competitivein recent years, the university community ' is turning its attention to potential support throughthe contract mechanismi.
A contract, unlike a grant, is generally awarded for the purpose ofmeeting a specific reqwrement that a federal agency has determined to be important to theachievement of .the agency:s responsibilities.
The contract will tend, therefore, to be specificin terms of the agency's needs, and in the case of research, wdl usually be for the purpose of"applied" rather than "basic" research.
The contract, also unlike the grant, can be negotiatedwith any organization that is legally constituted to do business w ~ t h  the government, whethernon-profit or profit-making.Government procurement m its present massive scope is a relatively new phenomenon,having emerged fin a s  prpscnt form in the past quarter of a century.
Each of the many federalagencies involved in procurement - and most are - developed a set of standards'and proceduresto administer the contracting process.
While the procedures used by any gven agency tend tobe relativel) orderly in terms of that agency's requirements, they will not necessarily conform tothe practices of  anoJler agency.
Looking at the federal government as a whole, however, theset of.
practices is varied, highly technical and often confusing.
The general descriptions offeredin 'this statement, therefore, are subject to the differing qualifications and refinements establishedby individd government agencies.In recent years there has been an attempt to  bring mter-agency consistency to theprocurement' process.
A speclal government task force has recommended legislation -which wouldbring uniformity in procurement policy.
Congress is considering such legislation, which will bediscussed later.Basic contractual agreements with the federal government are developed in one offour ways:A.
Sole Sotrrce I'roclrrement.
The government negotiates with one and only oneprovider on the grounds that the product or service is uniqucly provided by the organizationin question.B.
Sitlqlc Solrrco Procir r ( w l o l t  Thc governmcot ncgotlatcs with onc and onl).o n c  profidel in ir~stances whcrc tllcrc could bc cnmpctlttve Lids but becnusc of f'ictors such.IS locnnon, co~ lven ienc~  or spoc1.d urgency competitive bidding 16 unwarranted.C.

O ~ C V P  CIotrip~tlttoil.
CorltrI~cts .ue lct by open bid, u t i l i ~ i n ~  the mmdatoryprovisions for ndvcrtts~ng publlcly the availability of the contract, and ope,, solicitation ofproposals AS dcscrlbcd Intcr.In dddition to  the four types o f  contractual processes, there are special types ofcontractual arrangements for special purposes.
For university representatives, the Ope11 andNo Cost Contracts 'Ire o f  particular interest.
These contracts permit the exchange of equip-ment, p~~rticularly scientific equipment, and documents for specified purposes wlthout actualfiscal trmiaction.o f  the various contractual patterns, the Open Competition is becoming the mostcommon contract mcchanhm.
Since the government purchases goods and servlces on a dadybass and in amounts totaling blllions of dollars annually, the problem for potential investiga-tors is how to d~scover t h ~ t  a contract of interest wdl be let and whether thew organizationshave sufficiently reasonable chances of winning the contract t o  justify the extensive and un-compensatablc cffort required to apply.Each competitive contract let by the government must be announced as open tocornpetltion.
The announcement i$ in the form of a Request for Proposal ( R F P ) .
The an-nouncement must be published in the journal that has begome the pnrnary source for allcontract information the Conirnerce B~cslness Dally.
The Commerce Business Daily is p b -Lshed In Chicago as a senrice of  the Department of Commerce.
(It may be ordered fromthe Government Pnntlng Office, Washingtpn, D.C.; the subscription rate is currently 563.50per year.)
The Commerce ~ ~ r s ~ ~ z o s s  Dally has a small staff a ~ ~ d  consequently must publishRFP announcements.
as they arc written by the contributing.agency.
As a result, informa-tion t ha t  is published regarmng a gven competition is often scant and late, with proposaldeadlines somctlrnes only a matter of days away from the dare of *jpblication.
~ r aquen t l ya notice d indicate the need to send for more detailed information promded by the agencyoffering the contract.
Writing for the necessary informat~on cuts Into the short tiine avail-able fir preparation of a proposal to  meet a deadl~ne date.Alternately, most agencies provldc an additional advantage t o  prospective blddersin the form of "Bidders Lists."
All current prospective bidders on a "Bldders List" arenotified of a pen&ng RFP, generally a t  the same time the Conzmerce Business Daily is notified,thus gvlng the bidder on the list the advantage of several days.In order to be included on a "bidders list," an investigator must contact the agencyw t h  which he intends to do business and request an %pplicatim.
Most agencies now useStandard Form 129*for placegent on bidders lists.
While there is some 'inter-agency cross-llstlng of bldders, for the most part appl~cants must expect to' submit Standard Form 129separately t o  each agency for placement on a biddcrs list.There are some difficult problems in the mechanics of the contract process o$which interested college and university representatives should be aware.
For example, govern-ment agencles,have established the rule that each organizot~on on a "bidders list" must respondeither positively 01 negatively to every RFP it rccelvcs.
1f an organization falls to  respondto an RFP with at least a notice of-  intent, it is removcd from the "bidders list."
Maintain-ing status on a "bidders list" therefore can become a tedious adrnln~strative task justrfiablconly to those organizations that lare geared t o  a heavy volilmc of government contracting.The "bidders list" does permlt the applicant organization to indicate the types of proposalsin which it 1s interested and its capacities t o  perform tasks, however, so that RFP's are sentto the Grganlzation only when the RFP 1s relevant to  the organizations' capabilities.
Someof the administrative burden on prospective contractors 1s eliminated by this procedure.Even hi the best of cacumstances,'however, bidders frequently have as llttle astwo weeks to  prepare a proposal.
Gcenerally the competltlon has the same tlme constraints,,but the process does require staff who are available and who can "drop everything" in order'to meet a proposal deadline.
Pnvate research corporations and consulting firms can admin-ister their w o k  so that they may respond t o  proposal preparation on short notice; respond-mg quickly to an RFP 1s frequently 'more difficult for university investigators with heavycomkitrnents to teaching and other university-relyed activities.Except for -the time constrants under wlilch one must work, ihe preparation ofcontract ptoposals differs little ,from the preparation of grant proposals.
In one sense, thepreparation of a contract proposal IS easier\,because specific terms and objectives are generallystated in the W P .
The proposal is frequently a statement of  the methodology and proce-dures for acbiewy!
prescnbed objectives.
On the other hand, the contract leaves little lati-tude for the creative investigator to detennme'the character of  the rtisearcb to his own stan-dards.
The agency sponsoring the RFP sometimes employs qualified persollb who can statea valid set of object&ves and specifications for the contract; sometimes, however, it does not.It might be .necessary for  he response t o  ~IJ  RFP t o  contain arguments for d tenng  objectivesand specifications that diplo~atical ly demonstrate how the governments' Interests d beserved.Contracting also can take place by mean6 of an "Unsolicited Proposal."
The in-vestigator sul~mits a proposal which hk has initiated to an appropnate federal agency and theagency can respond at its discretion it the proposal meets agency needs.
Generally the un-solicited proposal rises as a result of prim informal discussions between the investigator andthe government agent.When a contract has been awarded by a gart~culnr agency, thc investigator's fiscalagent must meet with thc agency's contract off icer  to negotiate the final terms of tbc con-tract.
Thc type of negotiatiotl wll depend upon whether the contlact is i;trr~l-l'riccb or  Cuct-~ei?rrbursable.
A Fixed-Pflce contrLct is one in wlllcll thc olganizdtion and the agency agreeupon contract terms for a  re-determined fixed cost.
Once the Fixed-Price contract is signed,thc organization must rncct thc terms of  the contract for the prlce regardless of  circurnstdnccs.The fixed-price con tract is generally more appro priiltk fbr products than for services.The Cost-Reimb~mable contract is ncgot i~tcd on the basis of cost e r t im~ tc s  ofmonthly operating levels.
The tnontlily bperdting level will bc the sum of  .dlbwn6le costs ona monthly basls during thc tirne of the contract.
~t is understood that thc Rnal prlce of .lCost-~cimbursablr  contract can go up (Cost Ovcrrun) or  down from tfic original' cstimatc asa function of  cdlowablc costs actucdly incurred.Thc ~ ixcd-pr ice  contract is easier to administer and simplifies record-keepmg.The reason for this is that once the pncc IS set the government is relgtlvely unconcernedabout how contract expenditures break down by category or  line items.
With the Cost-Re-lmbursable contract, completc documcntatlon by cost category must be strictly maintainedsincc the documcntaaon is the sole basis for relrnbursement fo r  expehditures under the cok-tract The adrnlnistration of the Cost-Reimbursable contract is much more tedious, therefore,than is the case !or the Fixed-Price contract, but doos have the advantage, given adequatebook-keeping, of entallins no risk to d ~ e  contractor.Bccause the t o t ~ l  cost of a cos t -~cimbursablc  contr'1c.t is an estirndte rather thana firm figure, the <~w.irdln~ of n colnpctltlvc bid can be based on f'lctors othcr tllan the"bo t to~n  line" cost.
Clearly the level of  operational cost wlll be a significa~\t factor in deter-mination of an award, but in tlie absence of strict FixcdCost.
the way is opened for numcr-o u ~  judgment factors t o  affect the decision of c~ward.
while the government has tried toestablish safeguards agrunst4 arbitrariness and favoritism, the latitude in decision-making is stillw d e  in open competition contracting and even wlder in the other contractural forms.WHAT CONGRESS IS DOING ABOUT THE PROCUREMENT PROCESSWhat has happened over the years is that federal procurement has become abig business.
Contracts for goods, services (which include research and development), andfacilities have reached $60 billion annually.
Although no statistics are available to describethe amount of federal contracts awaded  colleges and universities, we do  know that collegeand university participation in federal research and development efforts represents approxi-mately 14% of the total federal Investment in R & D, and that an increasing amount of thatmoney is awarded by contract.What is dist urblng is that despite thc magnitude of federal cxpcnditurescontract, the govern~lieilt has n o  angle office responsible for policies to  govern the procure-ment process, and no single source to  provlde guidance and inforrnatlon about federal pro-curement laws and regulations.
In fact, the fcderal government has no clear-cut definitionfor the terms grant and contract.As a result, we have been faced wlth confusing and complicated rules, excessivepaperwork, favoritism and abuses in procurement practices, cost overruns, and many other fac-tors that led to  a thorough study of procurement practices by the Commission on Govcrn-ment Procurement.The results of the Commission's work is now demonstrated in the Congress.
Usingthe Commission's report and recommendations as a bluepnnt, Congrcss is considering 1cgisl;l-tion to address procurement problems, including two major bllls of interest to State Universityof New York.One measure, certain to brlng about fundamental changcs a necessary to irnprovcthe system, would establish a central procurerncnt policy office in the Erecutivc off ice ,which would provide overall guidance and direction for federal procurcment policy Thcoffice would establish a government-wde system of uniform procurcment regulations, coordin-ating policies* and regulations of federal agencies, and exercising leadership in monitoring andrevising future policies and procedures.
The Adml~listrator would be appointed by the Presi-dent and approved by the Senate.
dl major decisions by thc office would be approved byCongress.At this writing, a House-Senate conference committee is considering the measure.Sources inkcate that the blll should be agreed to in the near future and wJ1 bc scnt to thcPresident for his signature.The other major procurement blll (S 3514, HR 9060) now under consideration byCongressional committees hopefully would eliminate the proscnt confusion among fcdcral age~~c icin deterrninillg whether the legal Instrument used t o  support Lhc desired goods or servlces shouldbe a @wt or contract, or cooperative agreement, simply b y  defining the terms clearly.
Undcrboth House and Senate versions of the bdl, the contracts would be used whenever the principalpurpose of the agreement would be t o  purchase goods or sewces "for the direct benefit oruse of the federal government" for "ultimatc ~ u b l i c  use."
Grants would be used as the legalinstrument when the objective would be "to accomplish a public purpose authorized by federalstatute" rather than for dlrect use by the federal government.
Cooperative agreement wouldbe used t o  apply whenever the acnvlty would be authorized by federal statute but "substantialinvolvement" of the federal agency is also necessary.At this writing, the bill is under consideration by House and Scnate GovernmentOperations Committees.
Since the legslation would directly affect agreements for researchand development by State University of New York and federal agellcies, a is recommendedthat interested persons remain aware of the measure's status.11.

Developed by "a Cambridge, Massachusettsresearch firm" (name and address unknown to AJCL) , themachine is described as capable of reading almost any printedtype from newspapers, magazines, etc.It is said to be able to recognize hundreds of differenttype faces and to determine the correct pronunciation of Englishwords.
However, its intonation is said to be flat, and itspronunciation o f  some words "bizarre"The machine is to be available for institutional use in-ayear or two, and for homes in four or five years.
The priceis predicted to start initially at $25K, falling eventuallyto a fifth as much.EDITOR'S NOTE: Any reader with further information to con-tribute is invited to write to AJCL.American Journal of Computational Linguistics M i  c ro f i  che 4 9 : 9 7Sold By La Jolla FirmTranslatingDevelopedBy JA3IES GARYWoshinoton 6ureaU Ch~cf .

It also was used bythe National Aeronautics and Space Ad-ministration dunnp the recent combinedU.S.-Soviet space night.Actually, however, ~t 1s much more thana machine.
It is a sjsiem developed by DrPeter Paul Toma of L;1 JoUa, who has beenworking since 1936 to comblne the capabdl-tkes of computers wth the sclence oflinguisticsHis system is known as "Systran," anacronym formed from the ~ o r o s  ystema n d  translation, or what he calls theworld's first fully automated universalmachine translauon system.FROM THE SAN OIEGO SUN, 1 1  MARCH 1976It is now being marketed in the UnitedStates and E u ~ o p e  bq Latsec, lnc , Tonla'sLa Jolla-based finn that takes it-5 name,agaln an acroq  m, from ":angmqe trans-lat~orl sjsternq and electro:lic comrnunlca-tions.
