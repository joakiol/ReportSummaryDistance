Text miningand information extraction systems can provide animportant, low cost and timely early warning sys-tem in these circumstances by identifying the firstsigns of an outbreak automatically from online tex-tual news.
One interesting characteristic of diseaseoutbreak reports ?
which to the best of our knowl-edge has not been studied before ?
is their use ofspeculative language (hedging) to describe uncertainsituations.
This paper describes two uses of hedgingto enhance the BioCaster disease outbreak reporttext mining system.Following a brief description of the BioCastersystem and corpus (section 2), we discuss in section3 previous uses of hedging in NLP and the meth-ods used to identify hedges in the current work.
Insection 4 we describe some initial classification ex-periments using hedge features.
Section 5 describesa ?speculative?
method of tagging disease outbreakreports with a metric designed to aid users of theBioCaster system in identifying articles of inter-est.2 BioCaster System & CorpusThe BioCaster system scans online news reportsfor stories concerning infectious disease outbreaks(e.g.
H5N1, Ebola) and makes its results available toregistered users as email alerts (Collier et al, 2008).In addition to this email service, data that has beenfiltered through a topic classifier but which is stilluninterpreted is used to populate a Google Map ap-plication called the Global Health Monitor.1The BioCaster corpus consists of 1000 newsarticles downloaded from the WWW and then man-ually categorized and annotated with Named Entitiesby two PhD students.
Articles were collected fromvarious news sources (e.g.
BBC, New York Timesand ProMED-Mail2).
Each document is classifiedas either relevant (350) or reject (650).3The corpus is designed to include difficult border-line cases where more advanced understanding ofthe context is required.
For example, an article maybe about, say, polio, but not centrally concerned withspecific outbreaks of that disease.
Instead, the arti-cle could report a vaccination campaign or researchbreakthrough.3 HedgesAccording to Hyland (1998), in an extensive studyof speculative language in science writing, hedges?are the means by which writers can present a propo-sition as an opinion rather than a fact.?
More re-cently, Kilicoglu and Bergler (2008) have presenteda method for automatically identifying hedges in thebiomedical domain.
In the current work, we used ascience orientated hedge lexicon derived from Mer-cer et al (2004).
The lexicon consisted of 72 verbs(including appear, appears, appeared, appearing,indicate, indicates, indicated, indicating, and so on)and 32 non-verbs (including, about, quite, poten-1www.biocaster.org2ProMED-Mail is a human curated service for monitoringdisease outbreak reports (www.promedmail.org.

Preliminary work showedthat the frequency of hedge words differs in the twocategories of the BioCaster corpus (relevant andreject) at a highly significant level using the ?2 test(P < 0.01).
Table 1 shows the 16 most discriminat-ing hedge words in the BioCaster corpus (identi-fied using the ?2 feature selection method.
)4 Classification ExperimentThe current BioCaster system uses n-gram basedtext classification to identify disease outbreak re-ports, and reject other online news.
We used hedg-ing features to augment this classifier, and evaluatedthe results using a subset of the BioCaster cor-pus.
One binary hedging feature was used.
The fea-ture was ?true?
if and only if one of the 105 hedgelexemes identified by Mercer et al (2004) occurredin the input document within 5 words of a diseasenamed entity.
Results are shown in Table 2, where itcan be seen that the addition of a single binary hedgefeature to the unigram feature set increases accuracyby 0.8%.
The performance does not however reachthe level achieved by the ?2 9000 n-gram feature setdescribed in Conway et al (2008).5 Towards a ?Speculative?
MetricUsers of the BioCaster system would benefitfrom an indicator of how ?speculative?
each newsarticle is, as breaking news regarding disease out-breaks is characterized by uncertainty, which is en-coded using hedging.
We use the Mercer list of 105hedging words as described above, in conjunctionwith statistics derived from a 10,000 document sec-Accept (%) Reject (%)High 64.2 48.3Medium 29.5 36.7Low 6.3 15.0Table 3: Proportion of Articles in Each Categorytion of the Reuters corpus to provide a ?speculative?metric.4 We calculated total frequencies for all 105hedge words in each of the 10,000 Reuters docu-ments ?
that is, the total number of hedge wordsper document ?
then ranked these frequencies (af-ter normalizing the frequencies to take account ofdocument length).
The bottom third of documentshad hedge percentages in the range 0% - 0.2544%(LOW).
The middle third had hedge percentages inthe range 0.2545% - 1.0574 (MEDIUM).
The rangefor the top third was 1.0575% - 100% (HIGH).
Doc-uments inputted to the BioCaster system auto-matically have their proportion of hedge words cal-culated and are assigned a value according to theirposition on the scale (LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH).
Ta-ble 3 shows that a majority of the documents in theaccept segment of the BioCaster corpus can betagged as highly speculative using this method.ReferencesN.
