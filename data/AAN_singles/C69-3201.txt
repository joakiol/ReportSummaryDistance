The primary objective of this paper is to describe an experimentdesigned to investigate the semantic relationships between the threebasis components of a prepositional construct: the governor, preposi-tion and the complement.
Because of the preliminary nature of theexperiment, only simple data processing equipment, such as the keypunchand the sorter, was used.
The implementation of this approach on alarger scale, however, would necessitate the use of more sophisticatedhardware.The described procedure uses Russian prepositions because, whileworking on this problem, the author was a research staff member of theRussian-English mechanical translation group at IBM's Thomas J. WatsonResearch Center in Yorktown Heights, New York.While the described procedure presents a tentative approach,which does not offer a solution to the semantic ambiguities within pre-positional constructs in Russian, it does suggest a method for exa-mining each basic component of a given construct in relation to otherconstructs containing different types of prepositions.The data used in the model was collected mainly from the SovietAcademy of Sciences Grau~ar and, to some extent, from the Soviet Aca-demy of Sciences Dictionary.
Initially an attempt was also made tocompile data from other dictionaries.
It was found, however, that thepresentation and the classification of the data was not detailedenough for the purposes of this study.
TherefOre, only some of theprepositions not listed as such in the previously named sources wereincluded in the experiment.
The next logical step, using the arrange-ment of the data as shown below, should be the culling out of addition-al data in the case of Russian, and complete data in the case of otherlanguages~ from dictionaries, concordances and random texts.
Followingvarious sorting patterns, the results should then be tested throughgenerative processes and checked against concorded 'real life' examples.General PurposeAs stated earlier, the purpose of the proposed approach is theestablishment of patterns of sementic correlations between:I.
Given Governor and its Preposition G(----~P (left boundaries)2.
Given Preposition and its Complement P~--"')C (right boundaries)3.
Given Governor and its l>reposition's G~----~CComplementThese relationships can be diagrarmned as follows:~ ~  (C)snb lwhere sn=sematic property of any value.-2-If either of the semantic components is found to exclusivelygovern the combination of the two remaining semantic components thenit can be said that(G)sn ?
(C)sn + (P)sn = SxwhereSx = valid semantic pattern = sum of semantic properties of(G)sn(C)sn and (P)snWhere confirmed, the established semantic patterns can be incor-porated into a look-up table as an additional tool for parsing pro-cedures and for testing the validity of class-membershlp within pre-positional phrases.
Where not confirmed or where the patterns are notclear, further refinement of the semantic properties of the componentsin question must be carried out.Method of ProcedureFollowing the classification provided by the Academy of SciencesGrammar (henceforth referred to only as Grammar), prepositional cons-tructs were coded according to the grammatical category of theirgovernors and the type of relationship (henceforth referred to only asTR) with their complement.
The following governor categories wererecognized: noun, verb, adjective, adverb, numeral.Next, the governors as well as the complements were coded ac- ~cording to their semantic properties from examples provided by the-3-Grammar.
This semantic classification was, in a sense, arbitrary inthat it did not attempt to map the universe of all Russian words inthe five governor categories, but tended to accomodate only those com-plements and governors contained in the examples, and only if theircharacteristics seemed relevant.
Thus, if the Grammar provided twoexamples of the usage of the preposition and the semantic propertiesof respective governors and complements were clearly identical, onlyone example was selected.
The listing of these constructs in the fivegovernor categories is given in Appendix I.Since, in an initial study of this type, a large number of seman-tic classes might tend to obscure the existence of possible patterns,an attempt was made to keep the number of these classes at a minimum.As stated earlier~ the adoption of this approach in an extensive studyof constituents within prepositional constructs would require moreelaborate semantic mapping.
For the purposes of this study, the totalnumber of semantic classes for nouns was narrowed to 24, for verbs 9and 6 for adjectives.
(See Appendix II)The classification of numerals and adverbs as governors was aban-doned when it was discovered that, according to the examples providedby the Graummr, their semantic values in no instance effected theselection of a complement of a given semantic category.
Thus the-4-#examples citing the usage of cardinal, ordinal and indeterminatenumbers such as '~{ECKO~KO" showed that these governors may c0-occurwith a complement of any class.
A similiar phenomenon was observed inthe behavior of adverbs acting as governors.
It is possible that amore detailed study of a large corpus will reveal the existence of de-finite relationships.The total number of types of relationships (TR) abstracted fromthe Gra~mmr was 42 (see Appendix Ill).
Since some of the prepositions,especially of the compound or adverbial type, were not provided by theGrammar with an example of their usage in a given TR, the latter wasderived through transformational cross-reference from the Academy ofSciences Dictionary, and when that proved impossible, it was suppliedby the native speaker of Russian employed by the Project.In order to fit the data for each TR on a s ingle iBM card (foreasier sorting), those TRs which seemed somewhat redundant or insuf-ficiently documented were combined and the total number of TRs was re-duced to Ii.
Again, while the TRs were translated literally from theGramsmr (admitedly, some of the translations seem a little awkward, e.g.
'togetherness'), the reduction of their total number was an arbitra-ry arrangement aimed at simplifying the overall research procedure.The manner in which the 43 TRs were reduced to II is shown in AppendixIV.-5-DThe II TRs used in the final analysis are as follows:I. Attributive 7.
