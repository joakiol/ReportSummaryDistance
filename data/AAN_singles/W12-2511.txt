Workshop on Computational Linguistics for Literature, pages 78?83,Montre?al, Canada, June 8, 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsA Pilot PropBank Annotation for Quranic ArabicWajdi ZaghouaniUniversity of PennsylvaniaPhiladelphia, PA USAwajdiz@ldc.upenn.eduAbdelati Hawwari and Mona DiabCenter for Computational Learning SystemsColumbia University, NYC, USA{ah3019,mdiab}@ccls.columbia.eduAbstractThe Quran is a significant religious text written in aunique literary style, close to very poetic languagein nature.
Accordingly it is significantly richer andmore complex than the newswire style used in thepreviously released Arabic PropBank (Zaghouaniet al, 2010; Diab et al, 2008).
We present prelimi-nary work on the creation of a unique Arabic prop-osition repository for Quranic Arabic.
We annotatethe semantic roles for the 50 most frequent verbs inthe Quranic Arabic Dependency Treebank (QATB)(Dukes and Buckwalter 2010).
The Quranic ArabicPropBank (QAPB) will be a unique new resourceof its kind for the Arabic NLP research communityas it will allow for interesting insights into thesemantic use of classical Arabic, poetic literaryArabic, as well as significant religious texts.
More-over, on a pragmatic level QAPB will add approx-imately 810 new verbs to the existing ArabicPropBank (APB).
In this pilot experiment, weleverage our knowledge and experience from ourinvolvement in the APB project.
All the QAPBannotations will be made freely available for re-search purposes.1 IntroductionExplicit characterization of the relation betweenverbs and their arguments has become an impor-tant issue in sentence processing and natural lan-guage understanding.
Automatic Semantic rolelabeling [SRL] has become the correlate of thischaracterization in natural language processingliterature (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002).
In SRL, thesystem automatically identifies predicates and theirarguments and tags the identified arguments withmeaningful semantic information.
SRL has beensuccessfully used in machine translation, summari-zation and information extraction.
In order to buildrobust SRL systems there is a need for significantresources the most important of which are seman-tically annotated resources such as propositionbanks.
Several such resources exist now for differ-ent languages including FrameNet (Baker et al,1998), VerbNet (Kipper et al 2000) and PropBank(Palmer et al, 2005).
These resources have markeda surge in efficient approaches to automatic SRL ofthe English language.
Apart from English, thereexist various PropBank projects in Chinese (Xue etal., 2009), Korean (Palmer et al 2006) and Hindi(Ashwini et al, 2011).
These resources exist on alarge scale spearheading the SRL research in theassociated languages (Carreras and Marquez,2005), Surdeanu et al (2008).
However, resourcescreated for Arabic are significantly more modest.The only Arabic Propank [APB] project (Zaghoua-ni et al, 2010; Diab et al, 2008) based on thephrase structure syntactic Arabic Treebank (Maa-mouri et al 2010) comprises a little over 4.5Kverbs of newswire modern standard Arabic.
Apartfrom the modesty in size, the Arabic languagegenre used in the APB does not represent the fullscope of the Arabic language.
The Arabic culturehas a long history of literary writing and a richlinguistic heritage in classical Arabic.
In fact allhistorical religious non-religious texts are writtenin Classical Arabic.
The ultimate source on clas-sical Arabic language is the Quran.
It is consideredthe Arabic language reference point for all learnersof Arabic in the Arab and Muslim world.
Henceunderstanding the semantic nuances of QuranicArabic is of significant impact and value to a largepopulation.
This is apart from its significant differ-ence from the newswire genre, being closer topoetic language and more creative linguistic ex-78pression.
Accordingly, in this paper, we present apilot annotation project on the creation a QuranicArabic PropBank (QAPB) on layered above theQuranic Arabic Dependency Treebank (QATB)(Dukes and Buckwalter 2010).2 The PropBank modelThe PropBank model is a collection of annotatedpropositions where each verb predicate is anno-tated with its semantic roles.
An existing syntactictreebank is typically a prerequisite for this shallowsemantic layer.
For example consider the followingEnglish sentence: ?John likes apples?, the predicateis ?likes?
and the first argument, the subject, is?John?, and the second argument, the object, is?apples?.
?John?
would be semantically annotatedas the agent and ?apples?
would be the theme.
Ac-cording to PropBank, ?John?
is labeled ARG0 and?apples?
is labeled ARG1.
Crucially, regardless ofthe adopted semantic annotation formalism (Prop-Bank, FrameNet, etc), the labels do not vary indifferent syntactic constructions, which is whyproposition annotation is different from Treebankannotation.
For instance, if the example above wasin the passive voice, ?Apples are liked by John?,John is still the agent ARG0, and Apples are stillthe theme ARG1.3 Motivation and BackgroundThe main goal behind this project is to extend cov-erage of the existing Arabic PropBank (APB) tomore verbs and genres (Zaghouani et al 2010;Diab et al 2008).
APB is limited to the newswiredomain in modern standard Arabic (MSA).
It sig-nificantly lags behind the English PropBank (EPB)in size.
EPB consists of 5413 verbs correspondingto 7268 different verb senses, the APB only covers2127 verb types corresponding to 2657 differentverb senses.
According to El-Dahdah (2008) Arab-ic Dictionary, there are more than 16,000 verbs inthe Arabic language.
The Quran corpus comprisesa total of 1466 verb types including 810 notpresent in APB.
Adding the 810 verbs to the APBis clearly a significant boost to the size of the APB(38% amounting to 2937 verb types).In the current paper however we address theannotation of the Quran as a stand alone resourcewhile leveraging our experience in the APB anno-tation process.
The Quran consists of 1466 verbtypes corresponding to 19,356 verb token in-stances.
The language of the Quran is ClassicalArabic (CA) of 77,430 words, sequenced in chap-ters and verses, dating back to over 1431 years.
Itis considered a reference text on both religious aswell as linguistic matters.
The language is fullyspecified with vocalic and pronunciation markersto ensure faithful oration.
The language is poeticand literary in many instances with subtle allusions(Zahri 1990).
It is the source of many other reli-gious and heritage writings and a book of greatimportance to muslims worldwide, including nonspeakers of Arabic.Dukes and Buckwalter (2010) started the Qu-ranic Arabic Corpus, an annotated linguistic re-source which marks the Arabic grammar, syntaxand morphology for each word.
The QATB pro-vides two levels of analysis: morphological annota-tion and syntactic representation.
The syntax oftraditional Arabic grammar is represented in theQuranic Treebank using hybrid dependency graphsas shown in Figure 1.1 To the best of our know-ledge, this is the first PropBank annotation of areligious and literary style text.The new verbs added from the Quran are alsocommon verbs widely used today in MSA but theQuranic context adds more possible senses to theseverbs.
Having a QAPB allows for a more semanticlevel of analysis to the Quran.
Currently the Qu-ranic Corpus Portal2 comprises morphologicalannotations, syntactic treebanks, and a semanticontology.
Adding the QAPB will render it a uniquesource for Arabic language scholars worldwide(more than 50,000 unique visitors per day).Linguistic studies of the Quranic verbs such asverbal alternations, verb valency, polysemy andverbal ambiguity are one of the possible researchdirections that could be studied with this new re-source.
On the other hand, the Arabic NLP re-search community will benefit from the increasedcoverage of the APB verbs, and the new domaincovered (religious) and the new writing style (Qu-ranic Arabic).
Furthermore, Quranic citations arecommonly used today in MSA written texts(books, newspapers, etc.
), as well as Arabic socialmedia intertwined with dialectal writings.
This1This display is different from the other existing Arabic Tree-bank, the Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank (PADT) (Smr?et al, 2008).2http://corpus.quran.com/79makes the annotation of a Quranic style a rare andrelevant resource for the building of Arabic NLPapplications.4 MethodologyWe leverage the approach used with the previousAPB (Zaghouani et al 2010; Diab et al 2008).
Wepay special attention to the polysemic nature ofpredicates used in Quranic Arabic.
An Arabic rootmeaning tool is used as a reference to help in iden-tifying different senses of the verb.
More effort isdedicated to revision of the final product sinceunlike the APB, the QAPB is based on a depen-dency Treebank (QATB) not a phrase structureTreebank.3For this pilot annotation experiment, we on-ly annotate the 50 most frequent verbs in the cor-pus corresponding to 7227 verbal occurrences inthe corpus out of 19,356 total verbal instances.
Inthe future plans, the corpus will cover eventuallyall the 1466 verbs in the whole Quranic corpus.Ultimately, it is our plan to perform a mergingbetween the new frame files of the QAPB and theexisting 1955 Frame files of the Arabic PropBank4.1 The annotation processThe PropBank annotation process is divided intotwo steps: a. creation of the frame files for verbsoccurring in the data, and b. annotation of the ver-bal instances with the frame file ids.
During thecreation of the Frame Files, the usages of the verbsin the data are examined by linguists (henceforth,?framers?).
During the frameset creation process,verbs that share similar semantic and syntacticcharacteristics are usually framed similarly).
Oncea predicate (in this case a verb) is chosen, framer-look at an average sample size of 60-70 instancesper predicate found in the Quranic corpus in orderto get an idea of its syntactic behavior.
Based onthese observations and their linguistic knowledgeand native-speaker intuition, the framers create aFrame File for each verb containing one or moreframesets, which correspond to coarse-grainedsenses of the predicate lemma.
Each frameset spe-cifies the PropBank core labels (i.e., ARG0,3 The Propbank style of annotation are already used with otherlanguages on top of dependency Treebank structures such asthe Hindi  Treebank project (Ashwini et al, 2011).ARG1,?ARG4) corresponding to the argumentstructure of the verb.
Additionally, illustrative ex-amples are included for each frameset, which willlater be referenced by the annotators.
Note that inaddition to these core, numbered roles, PropBankalso includes annotations of a variety of modifierroles, prefixed by ARGM labels from a list of 15arguments (ARGM-ADV, ARGM-BNF, ARGM-CAU,ARGM-CND, ARGM-DIR, ARGM-DIS,ARGM-EXT, ARGM-LOC, ARGM-MNR,ARGM-NEG, ARGM-PRD, ARGM-PRP, ARGM-REC, ARGM-TMP, ARGM-PRD).
Unlike theAPB frame files creation, where no specific Arabicreference is used, for this project, an Arabic rootmeaning reference tool developed by Swalha(2011) is used by the framers to ensure that allpossible meanings of the verbs in the corpus arecovered and all various senses are taken into ac-count.
The Arabic root-meaning search tool is free-ly available online.4 The search is done by root, thetool displays all possible meanings separated by acomma with citation examples from many sourcesincluding the Quran.
Once the Frame files arecreated, the data that have the identified predicateoccurrences are passed on to the annotators for adouble-blind annotation process using the pre-viously created framesets.
Each PropBank entryrepresents a particular instance of a verb in a par-ticular sentence in the Treebank and the mappingof numbered roles to precise meanings is given ona verb-by-verb basis in a set of frames files duringthe annotation procedure.
To ensure consistency,the data is double annotated and finally adjudicatedby a third annotator.
The adjudicator resolves dif-ferences between the two annotations if present toproduce the gold annotation.
A sample Framesetand a related annotation example from the QAPBare shown in Table 1.
During the annotationprocess, the data is organized by verb such thateach verb with all its instances is annotated atonce.
In doing so, we firstly ensure that the frame-sets of similar verbs, and in turn, the annotation ofthe verbs, will both be consistent across the data.Secondly, by tackling annotation on a verb-by-verbbasis, the annotators are able to concentrate on asingle verb at a time, making the process easier andfaster for the annotators.4 Available at :<http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/cgi-bin/scmss/arabic_roots.py>80FrameSet Example Annotation ExamplePredicate: wajada?????

The frameset / Annotation of wajada4.2 ToolsFrameset files are created in an XML format.
Weuse tools used in the APB project.
The Frame Fileediting is performed by the Cornerstone tool (Choiet al, 2010a), which is a PropBank frameset editorthat allows creation and editing of PropBank fra-mesets without requiring any prior knowledge ofXML.
Moreover, we use Jubilee5 as the annotationtool (Choi et al, 20010b).
Jubilee is a recent anno-tation tool which improves the annotation processof the APB by displaying several types of relevantsyntactic and semantic information simultaneously.Having everything displayed helps the annotatorquickly absorb and apply the necessary syntacticand semantic information pertinent to each predi-cate for consistent and efficient annotation.
Bothtools are currently being modified in order to han-dle the Dependency TreeBank structure, originallythe tool was designed specifically to handle phrasestructure Tree format.
Moreover, since the fileformats and the tree formats in the dependencyTreebank are different from the previous APBeffort, a revision in the Quranic Treebank outputhad to be done.
This involves mainly a change inthe annotated data format in order to add the rolelabels in the annotation file.
For the moment, all ofthe 50 XML Frame files have been created andsome manual annotation is performed to illustratethe feasibility of the experiment.5 Cornerstone and Jubilee are available as Open Source toolson Google code.4.3 Impact of the dependency structureTreebankHaving The Quran corpus annotated using a de-pendency structure Treebank has some advantages.First, semantic arguments can be marked explicitlyon the syntactic trees (such as the Arg0 Pron.
InFigure 1), so annotations of the predicate argumentstructure can be more consistent with the depen-dency structure as shown in Figure 1.Figure 1.
Semantic role labels to the QATBSecondly, the Quranic Arabic DependencyTreebank (QATB) provides a rich set of dependen-cy relations that capture the syntactic-semanticinformation.
This facilitates possible mappingsbetween syntactic dependents and semantic argu-ments.
A successful mapping would reduce theannotation effort.It is worth noting the APB comprises 1955 ver-bal predicates corresponding to 2446 framesetswith an ambiguity ratio of 1.25.
This is in contrastto the QAPB where we found that the 50 verbalpredicate types we annotated corresponded to 71framesets thereby an ambiguity ratio of 1.42.Hence these results suggest that the QAPB is moreambiguous than the newswire genre annotated inthe APB.
By way of contrast, the EPB comprises6089 verbal predicates corresponding to 7268 fra-mesets with an ambiguity ratio of 1.19.21 verb types of the 50 verbs we annotated arepresent in both corpora corresponding to 31 frame-sets in QAPB (a 1.47 ambiguity ratio) and 25 fra-mesets in APB (1.19 ambiguity ratio).
The totalverbal instances in the QAPB is 2974.
29 verb81types with their corresponding 40 framesets occuronly in the QAPB (58% of the list of 50 verbs).This translated to a 1.38 ambiguity ratio.In the common 21 verb types shared betweenAPB and QAPB corpora we note that 12 predicatesshare the same exact frame sets indicating nochange in meaning between the use of the predi-cates in the Quran and MSA.
However, 9 of theverbal predicates have more framesets in QAPBthan APB.
None of the verbal predicates havemore framesets in APB than QAPB.
Below is anexample of a verbal predicate with two differentframesets.FrameSetExampleAnnotation ExamplePredicate: >anozal ??????

can clarifythe meaning differences between MSA and QA asused in the Quran.
Although  both APB and QAPBhave this verb, they have different senses leadingto different semantic frames.
In the QAPB thesense of revealed is only associated with religioustexts, while in MSA it has the senses of released ordropped.5 ConclusionWe have presented a pilot Quranic ArabicPropBank experiment with the creation of framefiles for 50 verb types.
At this point, our initialstudy confirms that building a lexicon and taggingthe Arabic Quranic Corpus with verbal sense andsemantic information following the PropBankmodel is feasible.
In general, the peculiarities ofthe Quranic Arabic language did not seem to causeproblems for the PropBank annotation model.
Weplan to start the effective annotation of the resourcein order to finalize the creation of a QAPB thatcovers all 1466 verbal predicates.
Once released,the data will be freely available for research pur-pose.ReferencesVaidya Ashwini, Jinho Choi, Martha Palmer, and Bhu-vana Narasimhan.
