Proceedings of the 10th Conference on Parsing Technologies, page 93,Prague, Czech Republic, June 2007. c?2007 Association for Computational LinguisticsSynchronous Grammars and Transducers:Good News and Bad NewsStuart M. ShieberSchool of Engineering and Applied SciencesHarvard UniversityCambridge MA 02138USAshieber@seas.harvard.eduMuch of the activity in linguistics, especiallycomputational linguistics, can be thought of as char-acterizing not languages simpliciter but relationsamong languages.
Formal systems for characteriz-ing language relations have a long history with twoprimary branches, based respectively on tree trans-ducers and synchronous grammars.
Both have seenincreasing use in recent work, especially in machinetranslation.
Indeed, evidence from millennia of ex-perience with bilingual dictionaries argues for syn-chronous grammars as an appropriate substrate forstatistical machine translation systems.On the positive side, some new results haveintegrated the two branches through the formal-language-theoretic construct of the bimorphism.
Iwill present some background on this integration,and briefly describe two applications of synchronousgrammars: to tree-adjoining grammar semantics andto syntax-aware statistical machine translation.On the negative side, algorithms for making use ofthese formalisms are computationally complex, per-haps prohibitively so.
I will close with a plea fornovel research by the parsing technology commu-nity in making the systems practical.93
