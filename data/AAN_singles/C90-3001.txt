JoshiUniversity of PennsylvaniaDept of Computer & Information SciencePhiladelphia PA 19104-6389joshi@linc.cis.upenn.eduAbst ractLexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) is anattractive formalism for linguistic description mainlybecause cff its extended omain of locality and itsfactoring recursion out from the domain of localdependencies (Joshi, 1985, Kroch and Joshi, 1985,Abeilld, 1988).
LTAG's extended omain of localityenables one to localize syntactic dependencies ( uchas filler-gap), as well as semantic dependencies ( uchas predicate-arguments).
The aim of this paper is toshow that these properties combined with the lex-icalized property of LTAG are especially attractivefor machine translation.The transfer between two languages, such asFrench and English, can be done by putting di-rectly into correspondence large elementary unitswithout going through some interlingual representa-tion and without major changes to the source andtarget grammars.
The underlying formalism for thetransfer is "synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars"(Shieber and Schabes \[1990\]) 1.
Transfer rules arestated as correspondences between odes of trees oflarge domain of locality which are associated withwords.
We can thus define lexical transfer ules thatavoid the defects of a mere word-to-word approachbut still benefit from the simplicity and elegance ofa lexical approach.We rely on the French and English LTAG gram-mars (Abeille \[1988\], Abeille \[1.990 (b)\], Abeilld etal.
\[1990\], Abeill6 and Schabes \[1989, 1990\]) thathave been designed over the past two years jointly atUniversity of Pennsylvania nd University of Paris7-Jussieu.1 St ra tegy  for Mach ine  Trans-la t ion  w i th  LTAGsThe idea of using grammars written with "lexical-ist" formalisms for machine translation is not new*This research was partially ftmded by ARO grantDAAG29-84-K-0061, DARPA grant N00014-85-K0018, andNSF grant MCS-82-19196 at the University of Pen nsylvania.We are indebted to Stuart Shieber for his valuable comments.We would like also to thank Marilyn Walker.1 In tlfis volume.and has been exemplified by Kaplan, et al, (1989)for LFG, Beaven etal.
for UCG (1988), Dorr for GB(1989) and Arnold et al for Eurotra (1986).
tIow-ever, our approach is more radical in the sense thatwe associate with the lexical items structures that lo-calize syntactic and semantic dependencies.
This al-lows for the possibility that an explicit semantic rep-resentation level can be avoided.
2 The claims aboutthe advantages ofan explicit semantic representationlevel need to be investigated again in the context ofthe approach proposed here.
For examples, manytraditionally difficult problems for machine transla-tion due to different divergence types (Dorr 1989)such as categorial, thematic, conflational, structuraland lexical are not problems in the approach we sug-gest, Also contrary to UCG, but like LFG, we usegrammars that have not been designed for the pur-pose of translation.The underlying formalism achieving the transferof derivations i "Synchronous Tree-Adjoining Gram-mars" (as described in a companion paper by Shieberand Schabes \[1990\]).
~ The strategy adopted formachine translation consists of matching the sourceLTAG derivation of the source sentence to a targetLTAG derivation by looking at a transfer lexicon.The transfer lexicon puts into correspondence a treefrom the source grammar instantiated by lexical in-sertion (all its nodes and their attributes) with a treefrom the target grammar.
Although the approach isnot inherently directional, for convenience we willcall the English and French grammars, the sourceand target grammars.The translation proces.s consists of three steps inwhich the generation step is reduced to a trivialstep.
First the source sentence is parsed accord-ingly to the source grammar.
Each elementary treein the derivation is now considered with the featuresgiven from the derivation through unification.
Sec-ond, the source derivation tree is transferred to a2The formalism of Synchronous Tree-Adjolning Grammardoes not prevent constructing an explicit semantic represen-tation.
In fact, in Shieber and Schabes (1990) it is shown howto construct a semantic representation, which itself is a TAG.3We assume that the reader is familiar with Tree AdjoiningGrammars.
We refer the reader to Joshi (1987) for an intro-duction to TAGs.
We also refer the reader to the companionpaper for more details on synchronous TAGs.1 1target derivation.
This step maps each elementarytree in the source derivation tree to a tree in the tar-get derivation tree by looking in the transfer lexicon.And finally, the target sentence isgenerated from thetarget derivation tree obtained in the previous tep.As an example, consider the fragment of the trans-fer lexicon given in Figure 1.o7) J hn J hnTNP0* VP f NP0+ LP  \XV NP1 ,\[, V PP, l-t , ."
t /\apparentlyFigure 1:lexiconapparemment \]Fragment of the English-French transferThe transfer lexicon consists of pairs of trees onefrom the source language and one from the targetlanguage.
Within the pair of trees, nodes may belinked (thick lines).
Whenever in a source tree, sayGot, roe, adjunction or substitution is performed on alinked node (say nso~ is linked to n,~, t ) ,  the cor-responding tree paired with tsouree, ttaraet, operateson the linked node ntaraet.
For example, suppose westart with the pair 7 and we operate the pair a onthe link from the English node NPo to the Frenchnode NPI.
This operation yields the derived pairo~1.o~ 1ve r 0+ v e/ \ r  /\ [ J  ohn V NPI$ V PP\ Inissos manque ~1 ~h JohnThen, if the pair/3 operates on the NP1-NPo in~1, the following pair ~u is generated.or2\[ S S/ I  A IJohn V NP Mary V P_P1J I I I\ missesMary manque ~1 7h JohnFinally, when the pair 6 operates on the S-S linkin a~, the pair a3 is generated.0/3$ sAdv S Adv Sapparently NP VP apparemmcmt NP VPj MalT vJohnThe source sentence is parsed accordingly to thesource grammar, then the target derivation is gener-ated by tracing the pairs stated in the transfer lex-icon.
The fragment of the transfer lexicon given inFigure 1 therefore nables us to translate:Apparently, John misses MaryApparemment, Mary manque ~ JohnIn most cases, translation can be performed incre-mentally as the input string is being parsed.The aim of this paper is to show that LTAG's local-ization of syntactic dependencies (such as filler-gap),as well as semantic dependencies (such as predicate-arguments) combined with the lexiealized propertyof LTAGs are especially attractive for machine trans-lation.We show how the transfer lexicon is stated.
Wemotivate the need for mapping trees instantiatedwith words and with the value of their features ob-tained from the derivation tree corresponding to theparse of the source sentence.
We also show that thetransfer needs to be stated at different levels: match-ing tree families (trees associated to the same pred-icate), trees, nodes and therefore their attributes,since they are associated with a node.
We show hownot only subcategorization frames but also adjunctsare transferred, and how differences of syntactic andsemantic properties are accounted for ill terms ofstructural discrepancies.
Then we illustrate how theextended omain of locality enables us to deal withthese structural discrepancies in the process of ma-chine translation.2 22 Transfer  Lex icon-  match ingtwo  LTAG Lex iconsThe transfer is stated between the English andFrench LTAG grammars in a lexicon.
We rely ongrammars built from a monolingual perspective, butthe match between them can be one to many, ormany to one.2.1 Matching elementary treesInstead\[ of matching words, we match structures inwhich words have been already lexically inserted.This provides interesting disambiguations that couldnot be obtained by a morphological match.
For ex-ample, there is one morphological English verb leave,but the structures associated with it disambiguateit between intransitive and transitive leave.
Inter-estingly, these two predicates receive two differentFrench translations: 4Or4O~ 5N2'0$ Veeave\ /The pairs a4 and c~5 will correctly give the follow-ing translations:Sohn JohnJohn l_efi Mary *-~ John a quitlg MaryBy convention, in the elementary trees, the set ofmorphological flexions of a given word is written sur-rounded by baekslashes.
For example, \ leave\ standsfor {leave, leaves, left, ...}.
For each word in a mor-phological set attributes (such as mode and agree-ment) are also specified.
When a word in a tree isnot surrounded by backslahes, it stands for the in-fleeted form and not for a morphological set.Since lexieal items appearing in the elementarystructures can be inflected words or a morphologicalset, lexieal items of the two languages are matchedregardless of whether they exhibit the same morpho-4We use standard TAG notation: '1' stands for nodes tobe substituted, '*' annotates the foot node of an auxiliary treeand the hadices hown on the nodes correspond to semanticfunctions.
The trees are combined with adjunction and sub-stitution.Our approach does not depend on the specific representationadopted ha this paper.
See Abeill6 1990 (b) for an Mternaterepresentation.logical variations or not.
For example, English adjec-tives lacking morphological variation appear as suchin the syntactic and transfer lexicons, while theirFrench counterparts are usually morphological sets.The word white is thus matched with \blanc\,  stand-ing for {blanc, blanche, blancs, blanches).Words that are not autonomous entries in the En-glish syntactic lexicon (ex: complementizers, lightverbs or parts of an idiomatic expression), are notconsidered as autonomous entries in the transfer lex-icon; for example, no rule needs to match directlytake or pay with faire, or give with pousser, in orderto get the right light-verb predicative noun combina-tions in the following sentences: 5John t.ool~ a walkJohn a fail une promenade (Danlos 1989)John pays court_ t?
Mary~, John fait ia court d Mary (Danlos 1989)John ~ ~-~ Jean a poussd un criSome words existing as autonomous entries in theEnglish syntactic lexicon do not appear as entriesin the transfer lexicon because their French coun-terpart is a morphological f exion, not a word.
Forexample, the future auxiliaries will or shall are nottranslated as such.
The tense feature they contributeis transferred (as well other syntactic features) andthe future tense French verbal form will be chosen.2.2  Match ing  nodesMatching predicates of the two languages as a wholeis not sufficient.
Correspondences between their ar-guments must be stated too as shown in the followingexample:~6~7$ VP NPa$ VP I.V .NPI$ V PP., /I x .
I7/NP0 S - - ' - ' - ' - '~  S /$ vP j---NP0$ VP / \ A t/ V  NPI$ V PP,"k . "
i / x\ ~miss\ ~ ._~manqueA r l  ~NPI~John resembles Mary *-+ John ressemble d MaryJohn misses Mary *-+ Mary manque fi John5It has long been noticed that light-verb predicative nouncombinations are highly langalage-idiosyncratic, nd word-to-word transfer rules will inevitably lead to overgeneration runnatural restrictions.3 3These examples also show that it is not correctto match trees where lexical insertion has not al-ready been made and therefore the correspondencesbetween odes cannot be made on the only basis ofthe subcategorization frame.Arguments are matched irectly by the links exist-ing between them.
Adjuncts are matched indirectlyby the links existing on the nodes, at which they ad-join.
For example, in the following correspondence,NP0 S - ' -  ~Sv y~,/~e\ A PP ~aimeA Ithe AP node in the English tree is linked to the Vnode of the French tree to account for:John is fond of musicJohn aime ia mnsiqueJohn is very fond of musicJohn aime beaucoup la musiqueThe adjective fond is associated with an AP-typeauxiliary tree which is paired with a V-type auxiliarytree corresponding to the word beaucoup.2.3 Match ing  feature  s t ruc turesSome feature structures ofthe words appearing inthetrees are transferred in the translation process, butwith the value further specified from the derivation(and not with the one from the lexical entry whichmay not be as specific).
For example, fish can beeither singular or plural and is therefore stated assuch in the lexicon.
However, it can get its numberfrom the verb-subject agreement constraints, as inthe following sentences:The fish.
swim in the pond*-+ Les poissons nagent dans I'dtang (plural)The fish is goodLe poisson est bon (singular)Agreement features of nouns are lexically matchedonly in the case of two morphological sets.
In the easeof one (or both) entry being a single inflected word,the agreement features depend only on the lexiealentry itself and are directly assigned in the transferlexicon:\boy\,g \[hum=X\] ~ \gar~on\,N \[nura= X\]luggage, N \[hum=sing\] ~ bagages, N Inure = pl\]Because of these idiosyncrasies, agreement featuresof verbs are not matched.
We will thus rightly have:My luggage .0. heavy (singular)*-* Mes bagages ont Iourds (plural)based on monolingual greement constraints betweensubject and verb.Features assigned to the sententiai yoot node (ei-ther from lexieal insertion or from S dh~e adjoined ma-,'.%," '3terial) are transferred or not depending on whetherthey are assigned autonomously !nthe target lan-guage or not.
The feature tense for example is usu-ally transferred, but not the feature~:mode becausethe latter depends on the verb of the matrix sentenceif the sentence is embedded:Jean wants Marie to leave~-* Jean veut que Marie parte (Danlos 1989)2.4 Match ing  t ree  fami l iesIn order to transfer both the predicate-argument re-lations, and the construction types such as question,passive, topicalization etc., it is necessary to be ableto refer to a specific tree in a tree family.
This is doneby matching the syntactic features by which the dif-ferent trees are identified within a tree family, forexample <passive>, <relative, NPi > or <question,NP~ >.6As has been noted, transitivity alternations ex-hibit striking differences in the two languages.
Thetrees in the two families will not necessarily bear thesame syntactic features; corresponding tree familiesmay not include the same number of trees.When a syntactic feature of a given tree familydoes not exist for the corresponding tree family inthe target language, it will be ignored.
English treesfor prepositional passives will thus be matched withtheir corresponding declarative trees in French (un-less the English prepositional rgument is matchedwith the French direct object):John was given a book by MaryMary a donnd nn livre ~ JeanSimilarly, the feature <question, NPi > will betransferred but not the feature differentiating be-tween pied-piping and preposition-stranding i  En-glish, since French always pied-pipes:Who did Mary give a book to?~ Mary a-t-elle donnd un livre?When a certain syntactic feature xists for bothtree families in the two languages, but not for bothlexical items, it is ignored as well:Advantage was taken of this affair by John?
Patti a ~td tird de cette affaire par JeanJean a tird patti de cette affaireSuch idiosyncrasies are in fact expected and han-dled in our grammars, since they have both theirconstituent s ructures and their syntactic rules iexi-calized (see Abeill6 \[1990 (a)\] for a discussion on thistopic).6NPi refers to the noun phrase being extracted, usually 0for subject, 1for first object etc..4 43 Dealing with Structural Dis-crepanciesUnits of a LTAG grammar have a large domain of lo-cality.
Discrepancies in the internal structures beingmatched are in fact expected by our strategy, and nospecial meclhanism is required for them.fi;.1 D isc repanc ies  in  const i tuents t ruc turesI1.
is not a problem when an elementary tree of acertain constituent structure translates into an ele-mentary tree with a different constituent structureix:t the target language, provided they have a simi-l~p,r argument structure.
For example: idiom ~-+ verb;idiom ~ different kind of idiom; verb ~ light-verbcombination; VP-adverb ~-~ raising verb; S-adverb ?~matrix clause ... as in:The baby j_ust fell~-+ Le bdbd ~ tomber (I(aplan et ai.

For example in the pair 0"11, adjunction ofan adjective (on N) in the English tree correspondsto an adjunction on the French VP:John gave a weak coughJohn toussa faiblemenlFurthermore lementary structures of the sourcelanguage need not exist in the target language as el-ementary structures.
For example, there is no Frenchcounterpart tothe English verb particle combination.John called Mary up ~ John a appeid Mary3.2 D isc repanc ies  in syntact i c  p rop-e r t iesSome English predicates do not have the same num-ber of arguments as their corresponding French ones.In such cases, the pair does not consists of pairs ofelementary trees but rather pairs of derived trees ofbounded size.
Since the match is performed betweenderived trees, no new elementary trees are introducedin the grammars.
This addition of pairs of boundedderived trees is the only change we have to make tothe units of the original grammars.For example, the adverb hopefully has an S argu-ment.
Since there is no corresponding French adverb,the French verb espdrer (which has two arguments,an NP and an S) combined with on will be used:hopefully, John will workon espgre que Jean travaiilera.
1O'12/ oo\hopefully I /~'~e~sp6rerk ~ S;queIn the pair 0"12, hopefully is paired with a derivedtree corresponding to on esp~re.
The English tree forhopefully is paired with the result of the substitutionof on in the subject position of the tree for esp~rer.The right hand tree in 0"12 is a derived tree.Matching agentless passive with declarative treesis done with the same device:John was given a book~ a donnd un livre h JohnSimilar cases occur for verbs exhibiting ergativityalternation i one language and but not in the other.In this case, a supplementary causative tree has tobe used for the unaccusative language (see pair 0"13):The sun melt____.As the snow* le soleil fond la neige+-+ le soleil fair fondre la neige5 50?13S SA A se Se0  veA~neltk IVI~fOndre\The right hand tree in al3 is again a derived tree.Multicomponent TAG !Joshi \[1987\]) can also beused for resolving certain other discrepancies.
Thisdevice is not a new addition, it is already a part ofthe Synchronous TAG framework.Conclus ionBy virtue of their extended omain of locality, T reeAdjoining Grammars allow regular correspondencesbetween larger structures to be stated without a me-diating interlingual representation.
The mapping ofderivation trees from source to target languages, us-ing the formalism of synchronous TAGs, makes pos-sible to state such direct correspondences.
By doingso, we are able to match linguistic units with quitedifferent internal structures.
Furthermore, the factthat the grammars are lexicalized enables capturingsome idiosyncrasies of each language.The simplicity and effectiveness of the transferrules in this approach shows that lexicMized TAGs,with their extended omain of locality, are very welladapted to machine translation.
A detailed discus-sion of this approach will be provided in an expandedversion of this paper which will include a discussionof the applicability of this method for other pairs oflanguages exhibiting some language phenomena thatdo not arise in the pair considered in this paper.ReferencesAbeill~, Anne.
