1992been found in ti~e system's lexicon.With German as the source language, the firstprohlem in the treatment of compound words arisesfrom the fact that German compounds are writtenin one word and that in many cases, the form of thewords in a compound differs front the base form inthat either a so called ~hgenelement (connecting ele-ment or juncture morpheme) is added to tl~e modify-ins word or that one or more letters are taken awayfrom the ending of these words, ht order to allowfor a correct segmentation of the compounds, a codehas to be added next to the morphological declensioncode of the entries in the analysis part of the lexiconpointing to the corresponding morpheme types.2.2 Code for the  Connect ing  E lementThe importance of the correct encoding of the con-necting elerncut is shown in the following example.Suppose a word like Arbcitsamt 'job tenter' wouhtnot have an entry in the lexicon and Arbeif would nothe encoded with the connecting morpheme 's'.
Thesystem would then decompose the unknown word intoArbeif ('job, work') which is still correct, and Semi('~el~ct'}, which is obviously not the expected sec-ond constituent (which has to be Am( ('offtce, de-partment, tenter') because the 's' is not interpreted~s a morpheme but as tile first letter of the secondconstituent.
~ For several reasons, the correct encod-ins of the connecting morphemes (l'~gen-code) in notms trivial as it might appear.
First, there are varioustypes of these elements: zero morpheme: Umweft .-~Umwell beweonng; addition of a form of the inflec-tional paradigm of the word, e.g.
the plural ending:Diskette --* Diskette+n-lanJwerk; addition of a let-ter which in not in the inflectional paradigm: Instal-laflon -~ lnstallation+s programm; deletion of theending: Schnle ~ Schnl hot, deletion of thc end-ing and addition of another letter: WeihnachtenWeihnaehl+s konzert.There are quite a lot of words, however, which cantake more than one type of connecting morpheme.
Insome cases, it is only a question of usage, dependingon the head noun, in which form the word appcars; inother cascs, the type of jura:(ere morphcme has signif-icance in meaning distinction.
The noun GeschichtcF'story/hislory') is an example fur such a case (of.leischer 19821):Geschicht+s-buch 'history book'Geschichte+n-buch 'story book'This fact which can help disambignation has to berepresented in the lexicon as a transfer constraint forcompound nouns.
The type of juncture element is notpredictable from other forntal aspects of the nonn, e.$.from gender, declension code, etc.
There are certainregularities, but they are no~ consistent enongh toallow for an automatic encoding.
It is just am littlepossible to derive the connecting elements completelyfrom existing machine readable dictionaries (MILD);as a prerequisite, all words would have to appear in anMRI) in all their possible forms as modifying elementsof compound words.~More examples can be found in(\[l,uckhstrdt/Zimmermann t991\], l l6f).The (:odes which we assigned to the connecting el-ements relate only to the form of the morpheme.
Asfar as the implementation is concerned, the formalidentity of some connecting elements and inflectionalmorphemes on the one haml is used to simplify thesegmentation algorithm, and, on the other hand, thediffcrence betwecn connecting elements which are inthe inflectional paradigm and those which are not isused to make predictions on the possible position ofa constituent in a compound word.2.$ Possible Posit ions of CompoundConst i tuentsIt is possible to draw certain conclnsions from thetype of eonnecting element on the possible positionof a constituent in a compound word.
\])ependlng onwhether the juncture morpimme has the same formas a h~rm of the in\[lectinnal paradigm of the word ornot, or whether the ending of the base form of theword is deleted or not, the word with its juncturecan be positioned as a modifying constitneut in thebeginning or in the middle of the compound, or amthe modified constituent (the head) at the end, orin any (:ombination of the mentioned positions.
Thefollowing examples will make the idea clearer.13 Words with zero jnm:ture can be at any positionill a Conlponnrt word:Import-beschrSnkung ('import restrletion')Fisch-import ('fish import')Fi$ch-lmport-belchr~nk u gE1 Words of which the connecting element is in theinflectional paradigm (:an also be al, any positionin a compound word:Parlament+s-debatte ('parliamentary debate')(der Sitz des) Btmdes-parlament+s('(the seat of the) federal parliament')\[\] Words of which the ending is deleled can onlyhc in front or middle position: Schul-.hof ('schoolyard').

Con-sidering all German ominal compounds and not onlynoun-nonn-compounds, 44.4% of tltem were trans-lated into the English noun-noun-type, sThese are the data which formed the basis for oarfirst translation strategy, namely to translate Germannominal compoumls per default into English nounnoun constructions.
Since about 50% would then notbe translated correctly, i.e.
not according to languageusage, this first approach as been augmented by cor-pus based techniques which are currently at art exper-imental evel.$.8 Corpus Based Techniques$.$.1 Selecting the Target  Construct ionRecognizing that selecting the preferred target construction for a certain compound is in part an ar-hltrary decision of each language, it seems suitableto look for the information in a target language cor-pus.
The idea is that when the English compoundwe should generate does not appear in the system'slexicon we will try to match it against he corpus andselect a preferred construction according to the infor-mation found s. It should be noted at this point thatin many cases there are several egitimate construc-tions that may be selected, ltowever, the system can-not always distinguish these cases from cases wherethere is only one legitimate choice in the specific con-text.
Therefore, it is always necessary to make a se-lection, and our strategy is to prefer the construc-tion that seems most probable for being a legitimatechoice.
This strategy has also a stylistic advantage,as it prefers the more commonly used constructions.The most simple anti accurate method to startwith is to search the corpus for explicit examplesof the complete compouml and prefer that construc-tion which is most frequent.
For instance, the Ger-man compound 'Oppositiortsgrappe' may in princi-ple be translated (according to the findings describedin the previous ection) to either 'opposilio 9 group','group of opposition', 'opposilional group' or 'opposi-lion's group '.
Consulting a corpus of 40 million wordsof The Washington Post articles enables us to preferthe first ('noun-noun) option as it occurs 89 timesin the corpus, while the second option occurs only 3times and the other options do not occur at all.
Onthe other haml, in translating tile cmnponud 'Par-lamentsdebatte ' he statistics prefer the construction'parliamentary debate' (23 occurrences), where themodifier appears in its adjectival fornL In this case,the 'noun.noun' fornt, 'parliament debate', does notoccur in the corpns~ and the form 'debate in parlia-ment'occurs 3 times.In the cases mentioned above, the corpus providesenough examples of the exact compound we are look-ing for.
The only generalization that was used is totake into accmmt he morphological inflections of thewords (e.g.
counting also occurrences of 'parliamen-SThe conirastlve studies and their results are describedin detail in \[Rackow 1992\].

This approach is apphcable for an)' natural lan~ua\[~egeuerat  on task, hence the relevance of this section Is notrestricted to the application of tnachine translation.lary debates', with the plural form of 'de6ate~.
llow-ever, many compounds are too rare anti do not oc-cur a significant number of times in the corpus.
Inthese cases it is necessary to use various generaliza-tions over the constituents of the conlpmmd in or-tier to ohtain some relevant information.
A suitablesolution in to generalize over the part of speech ofsome of the words of the compound.
For example,the compomtd 'Umwellbewegun9', may he translated(among other options) to 'eeolooy movement' or 'eco-logical movement: This compmmd occurs only oncein The Washington Post corpus, in the form 'ecolog-ical movement', but this is not significant enough tomake a selection.
In order to obtain more informa-tion we look for compmmds in which either 'ecology'or 'ecological' serves as a prenominal modifier, withno restriction on the specific word which serves am thehead noun.
This information was searched for in thefirst 100,000 sentences of the Ilansard corpus of theproceedings of the Canadian parliament, which wastagged with part of speech ushtg a stochastic tag-ger \[Merialdo 199l\].
In these sentences, the form'eeoloqieal (noan)'was ohscrved 11 times while tileform 'ecology (noun) ' only once.
Using these statis-tics we regard the adjectival form 'ecological' as thedel'ault form whenever the two alternatives are en-countered and there are not enough examples of thecomplete compooml.
For instance, this default willbe used also when translating 'Umweltproblcme' to'ecological problems' or 'Umweltreserven' to 'ecologi-cal reserve ' (and not inappropriately to 'ecology prob-lems/r'eserve~.
The use of such defaults enables usto increase the coverage of the statistical method andtreat infrequent compounds of the target language.Another important purpose for using default con-structions for single words is to save storage space.Without defaults, we would have to store in our sta-tistical data base the most frequent construction h>revery specific compound whir:it occurs in the train-ing corpus a significant number of tbnes.
This mightrequire too much space wltcn training the system onthe very large corpora which are necessary to get highcoverage and precision of the method.
On tile otherhand, if we store the default constructions for sin-glc words, then we should store specific compounds,i.e.
comhinations of words, only when the preferredconstruction for these comhinations conflicts with thedefaults for single words.This leads to the following implementation scheme:During the training phase, the (tagged) corpus willbe processed twice.
In the first pass, the defaultconstructions for single words will hc collected.
Inthe second pass, all the specific compmmds will beidentified, but only those which conflict with the de-fault constructions will be stored in an exception list.When translating a new German compound (duringthe actual translation phase), the exception list willfirst be consulted to check whether one of its itemsmatches one of the possible alternatives for transla-tion.
Only if there is no relevant item, the dcfaultsfor the single constituents will be used.I .

AUG. 23-28, 1992as a special case of the prnl)lem of target word selec(ion in machine translation (which itself is a variantof lexical disamblguation).
As such, these ambig0i-ties wilt he treated by the general method deserihudin \[Dagan et al 1991\], which uses statistical data onlexlcal cooccurrcnce within specific syntactic relationsin a target language corpus.Consider the folh)wlng example given for illustra-tion.
The German (:o~tq)ound 'Re\]ormprozefl' ( re-/orm process') has in principle 9 possible translations.
There are three possible English constructions,'1101111 f lorin I noun of  no | tat  nounrs  not|n I ~n(I threet)osslbh~ translations for the word 'Prozefl', 'process','case' and 'trial'.
Out of these 9 alternatives, thec(mlt)ound 're\]orm process'occurs 5 tintes in the firsthalf of The Washington Post corpus, while all theother alternatives ('process of reform', 'case o\] re-\]orm', 'reform case' etc.)
never occur.
Using (best:statistics, the algorithm described in \[\])agan et al1.1t91\] selects 'reJorm process'as the preferred trans-lation.
It should bc noted that the info~r\[tation whichis used for lexical disambiguation may come fi'om ei-tlter within the compound, as in this example, or fron,the surrounding context, such as using the verb whichinteracts with the compound.4 Conc lus ionsThis paper demonstrates that the translation of nouncompounds i a difficult task.
l lavlng German ms thesource language adds the problem of segmenting thecompound into its constituents, a prol)letn which doesnot exist in many o(her languages.
The solution forthese problems eems to require varloas levels of in formarion, involving morphological, syntactic, semanticand stylistic criteria.Though these levels are general for \[:very naturallanguage processing task, WE have shown how a de-tailed analysis of the specific linguistic \[)hellorneu~tcan lead to an ellicient hybrid architectnre whichuses the partial information availalde computationally.
This architecture con,1)ines formal syntactic andmnrpltologlcal rules, wherever they (:an he spe(:ifiedaccurately, with empirical data whicll reltects sorer:or the semantic and stylistic considerations.
In thissense, this paper promotes the integration of thesometimes diverging streams, natnely the use of syln-hollo, manually stipulated linguistic ruk:s versus theuse of statistical data which is extracted alltolnat-ically from corpora, ht our view, these two disci-plines complement each other and are both esscntlalto aehleve high performance in practical natural \]angllage processing systems.Acknowledgements :  We wouhl like to thankEran Amir from llai\[a, Peter t~rown from Yorktownand Mark Beers and Myriam Welsehhillig from llcidelberg h)r their Itelp and comments.References\[1\] S.
