On a different axis, languages can be ranked accord-ing to the quantity and quality of computational resources.
Not surprisingly, there are correlations be-tween these two axes: languages like English and Mandarin have substantial resources, while many of thesmallest languages are completely undocumented.
Nevertheless, the correlation is not perfect; there arelanguages with a million speakers which are more or less unwritten, and there are very large languages ?some of the languages of India, for example ?
which are relatively resource-poor.Unfortunately, what counts as resource-rich (or even resource-adequate) in computational linguistics isa moving target.
For languages to move in the direction of resource richness, considerable effort (peopleand money) have to be provided over a prolonged period of time.
One can sit back and wait for this tohappen, or give up; alternatively, one can map out a realistic way forward, building on the strengths ofeach language?s situation.Among the strengths which may prove useful to building computational resources for languages are thefollowing:?
Long traditions of grammatical and lexical description?
Traditions of literacy and literature?
Local expertise in linguistics and computing?
The world-wide community of linguists and computer experts?
Resource availability in related languagesAt the same time, there are weaknesses and other problems ?
some language specific, some more gen-eral ?
which need to be considered:?
Lack of consensus on ways of representing the language (scripts, character encoding)?
Complexities inherent in particular languages (complex scripts, complex morphologies, variantorthographies, diglossia, dialectal variation)?
Economic and educational realities in the countries where the language is spoken?
Political attitudes towards some languages, particularly minority languages?
The 'not invented here' syndrome?
Software obsolescence, and the potential obsolescence of language dataThis talk will look at ways in which the strengths enumerated above might be leveraged, while avoidingthe potential weaknesses.12
