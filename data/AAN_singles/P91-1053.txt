In t roduct ionTo resolve or not to resolve, that is the structural ambigu-ity dilemma.
The traditional wisdom is to disambiguate onlywhen it matters in terms of the meaning of the utterance, andto do so using the computationally least costly information.NLP work on PP-attachment has followed this wisdom, andmuch effort has been focused on formulating structural andlexical strategies for resolving noun-phrase and verb-phrase(NP-PP vs. VP-PP) attachment ambiguity (e.g.
\[8, 11\]).
Inone study, statistical analysis of the distribution of lexicalitems in a very large text yielded 78% correct parses whiletwo humans achieved just 85%\[5\].
The close performanceof machine and human led the authors to pose two issuesthat will be addressed in this paper: is the predictive powerof distributional data due to "a complementation relation, amodification relation, or something else", and what charac-terizes the attachments hat escape prediction?2.
P ragmat ica l ly  ambiguous  PPsAlthough structural and lexical rules alone do not suffice todisambiguate all kinds of PPs, discourse modelling is viewedas computationally costly (cf.
\[1\]).
The debate over resolu-tion strategies i not simply about practicality, but rather,at stake is the notion of what exactly it means for a PPto attach.
This paper defends discourse-level strategies byarguing that a certain PP-attachment ambiguity, sententialvs.
verb-phrase (S-PP vs. VP-PP), reflects a third kindof relation that is pragmatic in nature.
As noted in \[11\],context-dependent preferences cannot be computed a priori,so pragmatic PP-attachment ambiguities are among thosethat defy structural and lexical rules for disambiguation.Another criticism aimed at discourse-level approaches ithat pragmatic ambiguities can be left unresolved becausethey do not affect the meaning of an utterance.
In the case ofS-PPs and VP-PPs, however, the linguistic evidence pointsto significant meaning differences (section 3).
This paperoffers a unified account of the linguistic behavior of thesePPs which is expressed in a new formalism (section 4), andconcludes that the resolution of pragmatic PP-attachmentambiguity is necessary for language understanding (section5).3.
The  need to d i sambiguate3.1 L inguist ic  ev idenceLinguists have identified instrumental, locative and temporaladverbial PPs as the most structurally unrestricted, context-dependent types of PPs \[6, 10\].
These kinds of PPs often canattach either to S or VP.
Thus, Warren sang in the park canbe paraphrased as either Where Warren sang was in the parkor What Warren did in the park was sing.
Kuno argues thatthe former interpretation i volves a place-identifying VP-PP,and the latter a scene-setting S-PP.
Also, the following mean-ing differences occur:g iven-new/ theme-rheme S-PPs are given/themes, VP-PPs are new/themes.p reposab i l i ty  S-PPs can be preposed, preposed VP-PPssound awkward and often change meaning.351enta i lments  S-PP utterances have no entailments of theutterance without the PP.
For VP-PPs ,  the utterancewithout the PP is entailed only if the utterance is affir-mative.negat ion  S-PPs always lie outside the scope of negation,VP-PPs may or may not lie inside the scope of negation.These aspects of meaning cannot be dismissed as spurious.Consider Kuno's pair of sentences:?
Jim didn't visit museums in Paris,but he did in London (1).?
Jim didn't visit museums in Paris:he visited museums in London (2).Kuno assigns (1) the interpretation i which'the PPs aresentential nd two events are described: although Jim visitedmuseums only in London, he also went to Paris.
Sentence (2)is assigned the reading that Jim was not in Paris at all butwent only to London where he visited museums.
The PPsare verb-phrasal nd only one event is being talked about.3.2 A pragmat ic  re la t ionThe behavior of these adverbial PPs reflects neither a com-plementation or a modification relation.
If attachment isdictated by complementation, an instrumental PP should al-ways appear as an argument of the verb predicate in logicalform.
But this sacrifices entailments for affirmative VP-PPutterances; 'butter(toast,knife)' does not logically entail 'but-ter(toast)' \[2, 3\].
If construed as a modification relation, at-tachment is redundant with phrase structure information andcuriously depends on whether the subject, or any other con-stituent outside the VP, is or is not modified by the PP.
Theremay well be reasons to preserve these relations in the syrt-tactic structure, but they axe not the relations that desribdthe behavior of pragmatically ambiguous PPs.The linguistic evidence suggests that the S-PP vs. VP-PPdistinction reflects a pragmatic relation, namely a discourseentity specification relation where specify means to refer in amodel \[4\].
Since this relation cannot be represented by tra-ditional phrase structure trees, the meaning differences thatdistinguish the two kinds of PPs must be captured by a dif-ferent formal structure.
The proposed event formalism treatsutterances with adverbial PPs as descriptions of events andis adapted from Davidson's logical form for action sentences\[2\] using restricted quantification.4.
A uni f ied fo rmal  account4.1 Event  representat ionsDavidson's logical form consists of an existentially quanti-fied evententity variable and predication, as in (3c)(Agt(Jones, e) AAct(butter, e) A Obj(toast, e) A Inst r (kn i fe ,  e)) for Jonesbuttered the toast with the knife.
Davidson assigns equalstatus to all modifiers, thereby allowing events, like ob-jects and people, to be described by any combination oftheir properties.
This flattening of the argument structureclears the way for using restricted quantification to 'elevate'some predicates to event-specifying status.
Following \[12\],the structure 3eP restricts the range of e to those entitiesthat satisfy P, an arbitrarily complex predicate of the formAuP~(zl,tt) ^ ...  ^  P,,,(z,n,n).
In expressions of the form(3e:)~uPl(z l ,  tt)A.. .APm(zm, u))\[RI (Yl, e)A.. .ARn(yn, c)\],event-specifying predicates appear in the A-expression whilethe other predicates remain in the predication Re.
Here-after, the term event description refers to the ),-expression,and event predication to the sentence predicate Re.
The twoparts together comprise an event representation.4.2 App ly ing  the  fo rmal i smIn the formalism, (3) represents sentence (1) and (4), (2):(Be : )~uAgt(J, u) A Loc(P,u))-,\[Act(v,e) A Obj(m,e)\] A(3e : )~uAgt( J, u) A Loc(L, u) )\[act(v, e) A Obj(m, e)\] (3)-(Be : )tuAgt(J, u) A Act(v, u) A Obj(m,u))\[Loc(P,e)\] A(Be: AuAgt( J, u) A Act(v, u) A Obj(m, u))\[Loc(L, e)\] (4)In (3), the thematic S-PPs (in bold) are represented in theevent descriptions, whereas in (4), the nonthematic VP-PPsare in the event predications.
Now the well-worn given-newdistinction can be replaced by the more precise distinctionmade by the event formalism.
Event-speci~ing PPs appearin the event description and contribute to the specificationof an event entity in the discourse model.
Predication PPsappear in the event predication and convey new informationabout the specified entity.The formalism shows how preposing a VP-PP can changethe meaning of the utterance.
If the PPs in (2) are pre-posed, as in In Paris, Jim didn't visit museums: in Lon-don, he visited museums, the original reading is lost.
This isshown in the representation: --(Be : AuAgt( J, u) A Act(v, u) AObj(m, ~) ^  Loc(P,t,)) ^  (Be : XuAat(J, u) ^  Act(v,u) ^Obj(m, u)ALoc(L, u)).
Since the event descriptions conflict-one event cannot take place in two places- this sentence canno longer be understood as describing a single event.The formalism also shows different effects of negation onevent-specifying and predication PPs.
Sentence (2) deniesthe existence of any ' J im visiting museums in Paris' event,so the quantifier lies within the scope of negation in (4).
In(3) negation scopes only the event predication; sentence (1)expresses a negative fact about one event, and an affirmativefact about another.
In general, a PP that lies outside thescope of negation appears in the description Pu of a repre-sentation of form (3e : AuPu)-,\[Re\].
A PP that lies insideappears in the predication Re of form -,(3e : A,,P,,)\[Re\].Finally, the formalism lends insight into differences in en-tailments.
The following entailment relationship holds foraffirmative VP-PP sentences, where R,,(y,,, e) represents hePP predicate: (3e : AuPu)\[Rl(yl,e) ^ .
.
.
^  R,,_~(y,,-1,e) ^a .
(~.
,e ) \ ]  ~ (3e : AuP~) \ [~ l (y , ,e )^ .
.
.
^ R .
- l (y .
-1 ,e ) \ ] .A PP predicate Rn(yn,e) in a negated event predicationmay or may not be negated, so the entailment for negativeVP-PP sentences i blocked: (Be: AnPu)'~\[Ra(ya, e) A .
.
.
^Rn- i  (yn-a, e) A Sn(y,,, e)\] ~ (Be: ~uPn)-,\[R1 (Yl, e) A .
.
.
^Rn- l (y , -1 ,  e)\].
Why S-PP sentences have no entailments ia separate matter.
Eliminating an event-specifying PP froman event description yields a representation with a differentdescription.
Intuitively, it seems desirable that no entail-ment relations hold between different ypes of entities.
Theformalism preserves this condition.The proposed formalism succeeds in capturing the dis-course entity specification relation and lends itself naturallyto processing in an NLP system that takes seriously the dy-namic nature of context.
Such a system would for each utter-ance construct an event representation, search for a discourseentity that satisfies the event description, and use the eventpredication to update the information about that entity inthe discourse model.3525.
Conc lus ionA preliminary algorithm for processing highly ambiguousPPs has been worked out in \[7\].
The algorithm uses in-tonation \[9\], centering and word order information to con-struct and process event representations i  a discourse modelstructured after \[4\].
The wider applicability of the two-partevent formalism has not yet been tested.
Nevertheless, oneconclusion is that the value of resolving any structural am-biguity can only be measured in terms of the semantics ofthe structural Iormalism itsel\].
In the case of VP-PP vs.S-PP ambiguity, an NLP system must not idly wait for syn-tax to choose how a PP should pragmatically function.
Thetraditional wisdom- find the meaning and do so efficiently-instead suggests that more productive than demanding ofsyntax unreasonably diverse expressive powers is to searchfor direct linguistic orrelates of pragmatic meaning that canbe efficiently encoded in a dynamic pragmatic formalism.AcknowledgementsThe author thanks Barbara Grosz and Julia Hirschberg,who both advised this research, for valuable comments andguidance; and acknowledges current support from a Na-tional Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship.
