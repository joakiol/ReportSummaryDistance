UniversityKyoto  Japanfkomatani kawahara rito okunogkuis	kyotou	ac	jpAbstractWe address a dialogue framework that narrowsdown the users query results obtained by an information retrieval system The followup dialogue to constrain query results is signicant especially with the speech interfaces such as telephones because a lot of query results cannot bepresented to the user The proposed dialogueframework generates guiding questions based onan information theoretic criterion to eliminateretrieved candidates by a spontaneous querywithout assuming a semantic slot structure Werst describe its concept on general informationquery tasks and then deal with a query taskon the appliance manual where structured taskknowledge is available A hierarchical conrmation strategy is proposed by making use of a treestructure of the manual and then three costfunctions for selecting optimal question nodesare compared Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system helps usersnd their intended items more eciently IntroductionIn the past years a great number of spokendialogue systems have been developed Theirtypical task domains include airline informationLevin et al Potamianos et al SanSegundo et al 			 and train informationAllen et alBennacef et alSturmet alLamel et al Most of themmodel speech understanding process as converting recognition results into semantic representations equivalent to database query SQL commands and dialogue process as disambiguatingtheir unxed slots Usually the semantic slotsare dened a priori and manually The approachis workable only when data structure of the application is wellorganized typically as a relational database RDBDierent and more exible approach isneeded for spoken dialogue interfaces to access information described in less rigid formatin particular normal text database For thepurpose information retrieval IR technique isuseful to nd a list of matching documents fromthe input query Typically keywords are extracted from the query and statistical matchingis performed Call routing task ChuCarrolland Carpenter can be regarded as thespecial caseIn IR systems many candidates are usuallyobtained as a query result thus there is a signicant problem of how to nd the users intended item among them Especially either onthe telephone or electrical appliances there isnot a large screen displaying the candidates andall the query results cannot be presented to auser So it is desirable for the system to narrowdown the query results interactively Moreoverinteractive query is more friendly to novice usersrather than requiring them to input a detailedquery from the beginningIn this paper we address a dialogue strategy to nd the users intended item from theretrieved result which is initiated by a spontaneous query utterance In section  we describe a method to generate a guiding questionthat narrows down the query results ecientlyusing an example of a restaurant query taskThe question is selected based on an information theoretic criterion In section  we presenta dialogue management method for a query taskon the appliance manual where structured taskknowledge is available We propose a conrmation strategy by making use of a tree structure of the manual and dene three cost functions for selecting question nodes The methodis evaluated by the number of average dialogueturnsAlthough there are previous studies onoptimizing dialogue strategies Niimi andKobayashiLevin et alLitmanet al 			 most of them assume the tasksof lling semantic slots that are denitely andmanually dened and few focus on followupdialogue of information retrieval For exampleDenecke proposed a method to generateguiding questions by making use of a tree structure constructed by unifying retrieved itemsbased on semantic slots In this paper we donot assume any structure of semantic slots Instead we make use of distribution of documentstatistics or a structure of task knowledge Wealso investigate cost functions for optimal dialogue control by taking into account of speechrecognition errors Dialogue Strategy in GeneralInformation Query TaskInteraction in an information query task can beregarded as a process seeking a common partbetween the users request and system knowledge In order to help users to nd their intended items from the system knowledge thesystem has to carry out not only interpretingwhat users say but also showing the relevantportion of the system knowledge to themWe assume that users freely set and retractquery keys based on their preference for information query systems If many candidates stillremain even after specifying all possible hisherpreference to the system users may have diculty in narrowing down further the query result Thus the system should generate ecientguiding questions to help users nd their intended itemsIn this section we presume the system knowledge as a pair of an item and a set of keywordsFigure  We dene keywords as a set ofwords representing contents of the items andtheir categories such as place food and so onare given This is similar to indexing words ina conventional information retrieval task Notethat it is not needed that the system knowledgeis structured like an RDBKeywords are extracted from a users utterance and are matched with the system knowledge Here we adopt the following matching Restaurant AChinese noodles meat dumplingShinjuku Kabukicho EkodaRestaurant BChinese noodles meat dumplingShinjuku KabukichoRestaurant CChinese noodles meat dumplingnoodles with boiledporkribsTakadanobabaRestaurant

condenceand does not appear in many items gets higherlikelihood Ljby CMiand dfi respectivelyThen we dene amount of information thatis obtained when the system generates yesnoquestion and the user answers it Here C is acurrent query condition A is a condition thatis added by the systems question and countxis the number of items that satisfy the condition x The condition consists of the conjunction of the keywords the user specied Supposeeach item occurs by equal likelihood the following equation denotes the likelihood pAyesthat the yesno question corresponding to

question that has themaximum value of HA The question is generated using the category information of eachkeywordBecause the obtained condition A is selectedby a viewpoint of narrowing down the currentset of items eciently the selected conditionmay be unimportant for the user In such a caseit is not cooperative to force the user an armative or negative reply Our system does notforce the reluctant decision by allowing the userto say It does not matter anyhow Insteadthe system presents the second best proposalWe explain the method with the following example in our restaurant query system in theTokyo area When a user says Please tell me arestaurant where I can eat Chinese noodle andmeat dumpling in Shinjuku area three keywords are extracted Shinjuku Chinese noodle and meat dumpling As a result of thematching using these three keywords  queryresults are obtained It is not cooperative toread out all of the  query results with a TTStexttospeech system Here the expected values of amount of information HA are calculated for each condition that corresponds to keywords included in the matched items except forthe three keywords Shinjuku Chinese noodle and meat dumpling Then we select thekeyword noodles with boiledporkribs thathas the maximum value HA By generating aquestion like Would you like one which servesnoodles with boiledporkribs and obtaininga reply from the user the system adds the newcondition and narrows down the candidates efciently If the user thinks that the conditionnoodles with boiledporkribs is not important and tells the system so for example Either will do the system can show the secondbest proposal Would you like one located inKabukicho area Thus the query result canbe narrowed down without forcing the user unnatural yesno answers Dialogue Strategy for Query onAppliance ManualsIn this section we present another ecient solution in the case that the structure or hierarchyof task knowledge is available The task hereis to nd the appropriate item in the manualof electric appliances with a spoken dialogue interface Such an interface will be useful as therecent appliances become complex with manyfeatures and so are their manuals In the appliances such as VTR Video Tape Recorderand FAX machines there is not a large screento display the list of matched candidates to beselected by the user Therefore we address aspoken dialogue strategy to determine the mostappropriate one from the list of candidatesAn alternative system design is the use of directory search as adopted in voice portal systems where the documents are hierarchicallystructured and the system prompts users to select one of the menu from the top to the leafThe method is rigid and not userfriendly sinceusers often have trouble in selection and wantto specify by their own expression The proposed system allows users to make queries spontaneously and makes use of the directory structure in the followup dialogue to determine themost appropriate one System OverviewAn overview of the system is illustrated in Figure  It consists of following processes Keyword spotting from user utterances using an ASR automatic speech recognitionsystem Kawahara et alA natural spoken language query

dialogue to determine the mostappropriate one from the list of candidatesAs a result of the matching many candidates are usually found They may includeirrelevant ones because of speech recognition errors But it is not practical to readout all of them in order with a TTS texttospeech system Therefore dialogue isinvoked to narrow down to the intendedone This dialogue is restricted to

shouldmake conrmation on it When there are manycandidates with similar condence and theycan be hierarchically grouped into several categories we had better rst identify which category the intended one belongs to In this workwe make use of the section structure of the manual ie section is the rst layer subsection isthe secondlayer and so on The tree structureis automatically
