1We present in this paper a morphological nalyzer andgenerator for French that contains a dictionary of700,000 inflected words called DELAF 1, and a full two-level system aimed at the analysis of new derivatives.Hence, this tool recognizes and generates both correctinflected forms of French simple words (DELAF look-up procedure) and new derivatives and their inflectedforms (two-level analysis).
Moreover, aclear distinctionis made between dictionary look-up processes and newwords analyses in order to clearly identify the analysesthat involve heuristic rules.We tested this tool upon a French corpus of1,300 ,000  words with significant results(Clemenceau D. 1992).
With regards to efficiency, sincethis tool is compiled into a unique transducer, itprovides avery fast look-up procedure (1,100 words persecond) at a low memory cost (around 1.3 Mb inRAM).Enhancing a large scale dictionarywith a two-level systemDavid Clemenceau & Emmanuel RocheLADL: Latxaatoire d'Automatique Documentaire et LinguistiqueUniversit6 Paris 7; 2, place Jussieu, 75251 Paris cedex 05, Francee-mail: roche@ max.ladl.jussieu.frI n t roduct ion  \[Trans((Pref * DELAS) c~ SaC) c~ Rules\] u \[rans(Pref?

Eachentry defines apartial function, as in:inculpons ~ inculper , V&P l pwhich corresponds to the first person plural in thepresent tense of the verb inculper (to charge someone).The union of these 700,000 partial functions leads tothe transducer DELAF stored in 1Mb with a look-upprocedme of 1,100 words per second.The 70 two-level rules that describe the waycharacteas te changed when prefixes or suffixes are addedto words are themselves transducers (Karttunen et al,1992).
The two following two-level rules generate thetwo surface forms co\[nculper and co-inculper whenadding the prefbt co- to the verb inculper:i:i ?

Ourtransducer analyzed 75% of these graphical forms, whichis 3% more that the transducer of DELAF alone, at aspeed of 1,100 words per second.
Hence, more than 97%of the word occurrences of our corpus have beenanalyzed in the following way:algorithmisation ~ algorithme,N*iser,V*Ation,N* f*.sReferences\[Clemenceau, 1992\] David Clemenceau.
