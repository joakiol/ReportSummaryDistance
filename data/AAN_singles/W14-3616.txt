In Ara-bic, there are some typical common errorsbased on letter errors, such as confusing inthe form of Hamza ???
?, confusion betweenDaad ???
and Za ??
?, and the omission dotswith Yeh ???
and Teh ???
.So we propose in this paper a system de-scription of a mechanism for automaticcorrection of common errors in Arabicbased on rules, by using two methods, alist of words and regular expressions.Keywords: AutoCorrect, spell checking, Arabiclanguage processing.1 IntroductionSpell check is the most important functions ofcorrect writing, whether manual or assisted byprograms, it detects errors and suggests correc-tions.Conventional spelling checkers detect typ-ing errors simply by comparing each token of atext against a dictionary of words that areknown to be correctly spelled.Any token that matches an element of thedictionary, possibly after some minimal mor-phological analysis, is deemed to be correctlyspelled; any token that matches   no element isflagged as a possible error, with near-matchesdisplayed as suggested corrections (Hirst,2005).2 Auto-correctionAn auto-correction mechanism watches out forcertain predefined ?errors?
as the user types,replacing them with a ?correction?
and givingno indication or warning of the change.Such mechanisms are intended for un-doubted typing errors for which only one cor-rection is plausible, such as correcting acco-modate* to accommodate (Hirst, 2005).In Arabic, we found some common errorstypes, like the confusion in Hamza forms, e.g.the word Isti'maal (???????
*) must be written bya simple Alef, not Alef with Hamza below.This error can be classed as a kind of errorsand not a simple error in a word (Shaalan,2003, Habash, 2011).Spellchecking and autocorrection are widelyapplicable for tasks such as:?
word- processing?
Post-processing Optical CharacterRecognition.?
Correction of large content site likeWikipedia.?
Correction of corpora.?
Search queries?
Mobile auto-completion and autocor-rection programs.3 Related worksCurrent works on autocorrection in Arabicare limited; there are some works on improv-ing spell checking to select one plausible cor-rection especially for correcting large texts likecorpus.
In English, Deorowicz (2005) hadworked on correcting spelling errors by model-ing their causes, he propose to classify mis-127takes causes in order to improve replacementsuggestion.In Arabic, Microsoft office provides an au-tocorrect word list of common errors, which islimited and not studied.Google search engine had improved itssearch algorithm for Arabic query by usingsome rules on letters which can be mistaken,for better words split based on letters proper-ties, for example if we type [??????????????
]*, theengine can give results for  ?Rae'at alJamaal?[??????????????
]*and [?????
??????].
, some otherexample: ?Altarbia wa alta'lim?, ?Google?,?Jaridat alahraam?,  [ ?????[?
]*????????????
*[ ?]????????????????
]*.Google Arabia says in its blog, that ?thisimprovement which looked very simple, en-hance search in Arabic language by 10%which is in real an impressive change?
(Ham-mad, 2010).4 Our approachWe have launched our first project about au-tocorrection for a special objective to enhanceWikipedia article spell checking.
Wikipedia isa large text database written by thousands ofpersons with different language skill levels andwith multiple origins, which make a lot of mis-takes.
The idea is to provide an automaticscript which can detect common errors by us-ing regular expressions and a word replace-ment list1.This objective can be extended to answerother needs for users in office, chat, tweets,etc.The idea is to use a non-ambiguous regularexpressions or word list, to prevent commonerrors, while writing or as an automated scriptfor large texts data.As we say above, our method is based on:- Regular expressions which can be used toidentify errors and give one replacement.- Replacement list which contains the mis-spelled word, and the exact correction for thiscase, this way is used for cases which can't bemodeled as regular expression.4.1 Regular ExpressionsWe use regular expression pattern to detect.errorsin words by using word weight (Wazn) and affixes.For example we can detect that words with the1 The script is named AkhtaBot, which is appliedto arabic wikipedia, the Akhtabot is availableon http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/??????

?, So we resort to build a list ofcommon misspelled words.To build an autocorrect word list, we sup-pose to use statistical extraction from a corpus,but we think that's not possible in Arabic lan-guage, because the common mistakes can havecertain pattern and style, for example, peoplewho can't differentiate between Dhad and Zah,make mistakes in all words containing theseletters.
Mistakes on Hamzat are not limited tosome words, but can be typical and occur ac-cording to letters not especially for somewords.For this reason, we propose to build a wordlist based on Attia (2012) spell-checking wordlist, by generating errors for common letterserrors, then filter resulted word list to obtain anautocorrect word list without ambiguity.How to build generated word list:1- take a correct word list2- select candidate words:?
words start by Hamza Qat' or Wasl.?
words end by Yeh or Teh marbuta.?
Words contain Dhad or Zah.3- Make errors on words by replacing can-didate letters by errors.4- Spell check the wordlist, and eliminatecorrect words, because some modified wordscan be correct, for example, if we take theword  ???
Dhalla ?
then modify it to   ??
Zalla ,the modified word exists in the dictionary, thenwe exclude it from autocorrect wordlist, andwe keep only misspelled modified words.words modified Spellcheck Add toword list??????

?The following list (cf.
Table  5 ) shows thenumber of words in each type of errors,Words count  Error type101853 words started by Hamza Qat'700198 words ended by Yeh152210 words ended by Teh marbuta396506 words contained Dhad94395 words contained Zah1445162 TotalTable 5 Errors categories in wordlistThe large number of words is due to the mul-tiple forms per word, which avoids the mor-phological analysis, in such programs.Customized WordlistLarge number of replacement cases in gener-ated autocorrect list encourages us to make animprovement to generate customized list forspecific cases in order to reduce list length.We apply the following algorithm to generatecustomized list from large text data set:1.
Extract misspelled words from datasetby using Hunspell spellchecker.2.
Generate suggestions given by Hun-spell1293.
Study suggestions to choose the bestone in hypothesis that words havecommon errors on letters according tomodified letters.4.
Exclude ambiguous cases.The automatically generated word list is usedto autocorrect the dataset instead of defaultword list5  Tools and resourcesIn our program we have used the followingresources:?
Arabic word list for spell checking con-taining 9 million Arabic words, from Attiaworks (2012).?
a simple Python script to generate errors.?
Hunspell spellchecker program withAyaspell dictionary (Hadjir 2009, Zer-rouki, 2013).
and Attia spellcheckingwordlist (2012).?
our autocorrect program named Ghalatawi2( cf.

A script to select best suggestion fromHunspell correction suggestions to gener-ate customized autocorrect list.ExampleFigure 1 Ghalatawi program, autocorrectionexample6 EvaluationIn order to evaluate the performance of auto-matic correction program, we used the data setprovided in the shared task test (Behrang,2014).
After that autocorrect the texts by Ga-latawi program based on regular expressionsand a wordlist.For this evaluation we have used two auto-correct word lists:- a generic word list generated from Attiawordlist, this wordlist is used for general pur-2 The Ghalatawi autocorrect program is availableas an open source program athttp://ghalatawi.sourceforge.netposes.
This word list is noted in evaluation as?STANDARD?.- a customized wordlist based on dataset, bygenerating a special word list according to dataset, in order to improve auto correction andavoid unnecessary replacement.
this wordlist isnoted in evaluation as ?CUSTOMIZED?.The customized autocorrect word list is builtin the same way as STANDARD, by replacingthe source dictionary by misspelled wordsfrom QALB corpus (Zaghouani, 2014).How customized list is built from dataset?1- Hunspell detects 3463 unrepeated mis-spelled word in the dataset, like????

?3- the script can select all words with one sug-gestion, and words with near suggestion as acommon error.
The script has select only 1727non ambiguous case (not repeated).The customized autocorrected list is used intest as CUSTOMIZED.We got the following results (cf.
