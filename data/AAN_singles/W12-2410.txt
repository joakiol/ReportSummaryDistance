The BioNLP?11 SharedTask extended the event extraction approachto sub-protein events and relations in the Epi-genetics and Post-translational Modifications(EPI) and Protein Relations (REL) tasks.
Inthis study, we apply the Turku Event Ex-traction System, the best-performing systemfor these tasks, to all PubMed abstracts andall available PMC full-text articles, extract-ing 1.4M EPI events and 2.2M REL relationsfrom 21M abstracts and 372K articles.
Weintroduce several entity normalization algo-rithms for genes, proteins, protein complexesand protein components, aiming to uniquelyidentify these biological entities.
This nor-malization effort allows direct mapping ofthe extracted events and relations with post-translational modifications from UniProt, epi-genetics from PubMeth, functional domainsfrom InterPro and macromolecular structuresfrom PDB.
The extraction of such detailedprotein information provides a unique textmining dataset, offering the opportunity to fur-ther deepen the information provided by ex-isting PubMed-scale event extraction efforts.The methods and data introduced in this studyare freely available from bionlp.utu.fi.1 IntroductionBiomedical domain information extraction has in re-cent years seen a shift from focus on the extractionof simple pairwise relations (Pyysalo et al, 2008;Tikk et al, 2010) towards the extraction of events,represented as structured associations of arbitrarynumbers of participants in specific roles (Ananiadouet al, 2010).
Domain event extraction has been pop-ularized in particular by the BioNLP Shared Task(ST) challenges in 2009 and 2011 (Kim et al, 2009;Kim et al, 2011).
While the BioNLP ST?09 em-phasized protein interactions and regulatory rela-tionships, the expressive event formalism can alsobe applied to the extraction of statements regardingthe properties of individual proteins.
Accordingly,the EPI (Epigenetics and Post-Translational Modi-fications) subchallenge of the BioNLP ST?11 pro-vided corpora and competitive evaluations for thedetection of epigenetics and post-translational mod-ification (PTM) events, while the REL (Entity Re-lations) subchallenge covers structural and complexmembership relations of proteins (Ohta et al, 2011b;Pyysalo et al, 2011).
The complex membershipsand domains define the physical nature of an indi-vidual protein, which is closely linked to its func-tion and biological activity.
Post-translational mod-ifications alter and regulate this activity via struc-tural or chemical changes induced by the covalentattachment of small molecules to the protein.
Inepigenetic regulation, gene expression is controlledby the chemical modification of DNA and the his-tone proteins supporting chromosomal DNA.
All ofthese aspects are important for defining the biologi-cal role of a protein, and thus the EPI and REL tasksenable the development of text mining systems thatcan extract a more complete picture of the biomolec-ular reactions and relations than previously possible(cf.
Table 1).
Furthermore, previous work has shownpromising results for improving event extraction by82integration of ?static?
entity relations (Pyysalo et al,2009), in particular for the previously only availablePTM event, phosphorylation (Van Landeghem et al,2010).Information on protein modifications is avail-able in general-purpose protein databases such asUniProt, and there are also a number of dedicateddatabase resources covering such protein modifica-tions (Wu and others, 2003; Lee et al, 2006; Li etal., 2009).
While the automatic extraction of PTMsfrom text has also been considered in a number ofearlier studies, these have primarily involved singlePTM reactions extracted with special-purpose meth-ods (Hu et al, 2005; Yuan et al, 2006; Lee et al,2008).
The EPI task and associated work (Ohta etal., 2010) were the first to target numerous PTM re-actions in a general framework using retrainable ex-traction methods.
The automatic detection of mod-ification statements using keyword matching-basedmethods has been applied also in support of DNAmethylation DB curation (Ongenaert et al, 2008;Fang et al, 2011).
However, as for PTM, the EPItask and its preparatory efforts (Ohta et al, 2011a)were the first to consider DNA methylation using thegeneral event extraction approach.
To the best of ourknowledge, the present study is the first to extend theevent extraction approach to PTM and DNA methy-lation event extraction to the scale of the entire avail-able literature.The Turku Event Extraction System (TEES), firstintroduced for the BioNLP ST?09 (Bjo?rne et al,2009), was updated and generalized for participa-tion in the BioNLP ST?11, in which it had the bestperformance on both the EPI and REL challenges(Bjo?rne and Salakoski, 2011).
With an F-score of53.33% for the EPI and 57.7% for the REL task, itperformed over 16 pp better than the next best sys-tems, making it well suited for our study.
We applythis system to the extraction of EPI events and RELrelations from all PubMed abstracts and all PMCopen access articles, using a pipeline of open sourcetext mining tools introduced in Bjo?rne et al (2010).We further process the result using a recentlycreated bibliome-scale gene normalization dataset1.This normalization effort connects protein and genementions in text to their database IDs, a prerequi-1Data currently under review.site for effective use of text mining results for mostbioinformatics applications.
In addition to proteinnames, the EPI and REL challenges refer to theprotein substructures, modifications and complexes,which we also need to normalize in order to deter-mine the biological context of these events.
In thiswork, we develop a number of rule-based algorithmsfor the normalization of such non-protein entities.With both proteins and other entities normalized,we can align the set of events extracted from theliterature with biological databases containing an-notations on protein features, such as UniProt.
Wecan determine how many known and unknown fea-tures we have extracted from text, and what percent-age of various protein feature annotations our textmining results cover.
This association naturally alsoworks in the other direction, as we can take a gene orprotein and find yet unannotated post-translationalmodifications, domains, or other features from sci-entific articles, a promising use case for supportingbiomedical database curation.2 Methods2.1 PMC preprocessingPMC full texts are distributed in an XML format thatTEES cannot use directly for event extraction.
Weconvert this XML into a flat ASCII text format witha pipeline built on top of BioNLP ST?11 supportingresource tools (Stenetorp et al, 2011).
This process-ing resolves embedded LATEX expressions, separatesblocks of text content (titles, sections, etc.)
fromothers, maps non-ASCII characters to correspondingASCII sequences, and normalizes whitespace.
Re-solving non-ASCII characters avoids increased errorrates from NLP tools trained on ASCII-only data.2.2 Event ExtractionWe use the Turku Event Extraction System for ex-tracting both REL relations and EPI events.
TEES isa modular event extraction pipeline, that has recentlybeen extended for all the subtasks of the BioNLP?11ST, including EPI and REL (Bjo?rne and Salakoski,2011).
TEES performs all supported tasks usinga shared graph scheme, which can represent bothevents and relations (Figure 1 D).
The system alsoprovides confidence scores enabling selection of themost likely correct predictions.

TEES handles all these preprocessingsteps via a pipeline of tool wrappers for the GE-NIA Sentence Splitter (Kazama and Tsujii, 2003),the BANNER named entity recognizer (Leaman andGonzalez, 2008), the McClosky-Charniak-Johnson(McCCJ) parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Mc-Closky, 2010) and the Stanford tools (de Marneffeet al, 2006).
For a detailed description of TEESwe refer to Bjo?rne and Salakoski (2011) and for thecomputational requirements of PubMed-scale eventextraction to Bjo?rne et al (2010).2.3 Entity normalizationThe extraction of events and relations as described inthe previous sections is purely text-based and doesnot rely on any domain information from externalresources.
This ensures generalizability of the meth-ods to new articles possibly describing novel inter-actions.
However, practical use cases often requireintegration of text mining results with external re-sources.
To enable such an integration, it is crucial tolink the retrieved information to known gene/proteinidentifiers.
In this section, we describe how we linktext mining data to biomolecular databases by pro-viding integration with Entrez Gene, UniProt, Inter-Pro and the Protein Data Bank.2.3.1 Protein annotationsA crucial step for integrating statements in do-main text with data records is gene name normaliza-tion As part of a recent PubMed-scale effort,2 gene2Data currently under review.84normalizations were produced by the GenNorm sys-tem (Wei and Kao, 2011), assigning unique EntrezGene identifiers (Sayers and others, 2010) to am-biguous gene/protein symbols.
The GenNorm sys-tem represents the state-of-the-art in gene normal-ization, having achieved first rank by several evalua-tion criteria in the BioCreative III Challenge (Lu andothers, 2011).For practical applications, the Entrez Gene iden-tifiers have been mapped to UniProt (The UniProtConsortium, 2011) through conversion tables pro-vided by the NCBI.
As Entrez Gene and UniProtare two of the most authoritative resources for geneand protein identification, these annotations ensurestraightforward integration with other databases.2.3.2 Complex annotationsThe REL task Subunit-Complex relations all in-volve exactly one protein complex and one of itssubunits, but the same complex may be involved inmany different Subunit-Complex relations (Pyysaloet al, 2011).
A key challenge for making useof these relations thus involves retrieving a uniqueidentification of the correct complex.
To identifyprotein complexes, we use the Protein Data Bank(PDB), an archive of structural data of biologicalmacromolecules (Berman et al, 2000).
This re-source currently contains more than 80,000 3-Dstructures, and each polymer of a structure is anno-tated with its respective UniProt ID.To assign a unique PDB ID to an entity involvedin one or more Subunit-Complex relations, thereis usually no other lexical context than the proteinnames in the sentence, e.g.
?the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1complex?.
Consequently, we rely on the normal-ized protein names (Section 2.3.1) to retrieve a listof plausible complexes, using data downloaded fromUniProt to link proteins to PDB entries.
Ambiguityis resolved by selecting the complex with the high-est number of normalized proteins and giving pref-erence to so-called representative chains.
A list ofrepresentative chains is available at the PDB web-site, and they are determined by clustering similarprotein chains3 and taking the most confident onesbased on resolution quality.Each assignment of a PDB identifier is annotatedwith a confidence value between 0 and 1, express-3Requiring at least 40% sequence similarity.ing the percentage of proteins in the complex thatcould be retrieved and normalized in text.
For ex-ample, even if one out of three UniProt identifiers iswrongly assigned for a mention, the correct complexmight still be assigned with 0.66 confidence.2.3.3 Domain annotationsProtein-Component relations define a relation be-tween a gene/protein and one of its components,such as a gene promoter or a protein domain.
Toidentify at least a substantial subset of these di-verse relations, we have integrated domain knowl-edge extracted from InterPro.
InterPro is a rich re-source on protein families, domains and functionalsites, integrating data from databases like PROSITE,PANTHER, Pfam, ProDom, SMART and TIGR-FAMs (Hunter and others, 2012).
Over 23,000 dis-tinct InterPro entries were retrieved, linking to morethan 16.5 million protein identifiers.To assign an InterPro ID to an entity involved inone or more Protein-Component relations, a set ofcandidates is generated by inspecting the InterProassociations of each of the proteins annotated withthat domain in text.
For each such candidate, thedescription of the InterPro entry is matched againstthe lexical context around the entity by comparingthe number of overlapping tokens, excluding gen-eral words, such as domain, and prepositions.
Theamount of overlap is normalized against the lengthof the InterPro description and expressed as a per-centage, creating confidence values between 0 and 1.Additionally, a simple pattern matching algorithmrecognizes statements expressing an amino acid in-terval, e.g.
?aristaless domain (aa 527-542)?.
Whensuch expressions are found, the intervals as anno-tated in InterPro are matched against the retrievedinterval from text, and the confidence values expressthe amount of overlap between the two intervals.2.3.4 PTM site normalizationSix of the eight4 EPI event types refer topost-translational modification of proteins.
Theseevents are Hydroxylation, Phosphorylation, Ubiq-uitination, Glycosylation, Acetylation and (Protein)Methylation.
To evaluate the events predicted4As we are interested in PTM sites, we make no distinc-tion between ?additive?
PTMs such as Acetylation and their ?re-verse?
reactions such as Deacetylation.85from text, we compare these to annotated post-translational modifications in UniProt.
UniProt isone of the largest manually curated databases forprotein knowledge, and contains annotations corre-sponding to each of the EPI PTM event types.We use the reviewed and manually annotatedUniProtKB/Swiss-Prot dataset (release 2012 02) inXML format.
We take for each protein all featureelements of types modified residue, cross-link andglycosylation site.
Each of these feature elementsdefines the site of the modification, either a singleamino acid, or a sequence of amino acids.
We selectonly annotations based on experimental findings,that is, features that do not have a non-experimentalstatus (potential, probable or by similarity) to avoide.g.
features only inferred from the sequence.The modified residue feature type covers the eventtypes Hydroxylation, Phosphorylation, Acetylationand Methylation.
We determine the class of the mod-ification with the UniProt controlled vocabulary ofpost-translational modifications5.
The descriptionattribute is the ID attribute of an entry in the vocabu-lary, through which we can determine the more gen-eral keyword (KW) for that description, if defined.These keywords can then be connected to the corre-sponding event types in the case of Hydroxylation,Phosphorylation, Acetylation and Methylation.
ForUbiquitination events, we look for the presence ofthe string ?ubiquitin?
in the description attribute ofcross-link features.
Finally, features correspondingto Glycosylation events are determined by their fea-ture element having the type glycosylation site.The result of this selection process is a list of in-dividual modification features, which contain a typecorresponding to one of the EPI PTM event types,the UniProt ID of the protein, and the position andamino acid(s) of the modification site.
This data canbe compared with extracted events, using their type,normalized protein arguments and modification sitearguments.
However, we also need to normalize themodification site arguments.PTM sites are defined with a modification typeand the numbered target amino acid residue.
In EPIevents, these residues are defined in the site argu-ment target entities.
To convert these into a formthat can be aligned with UniProt, we apply a set5http://www.uniprot.org/docs/ptmlist/Event Type Extracted PMC (%)Hydroxylation 14,555 34.17Phosphorylation 726,757 44.00Ubiquitination 74,027 70.46DNA methylation 140,531 52.27Glycosylation 154,523 42.31Acetylation 114,585 69.40Methylation 122,015 74.86Catalysis 45,763 67.86Total EPI 1,392,756 51.53Protein-Component 1,613,170 52.59Subunit-Complex 537,577 51.18Total REL 2,150,747 52.23Table 2: Total number of EPI events and REL relationsextracted from PubMed abstracts and PMC full-text arti-cles, with the fractions extracted from PMC.of rules that try to determine whether a site is anamino acid.
We start from the main site token, andcheck whether it is of the form AA#, where AA is anamino acid name, or a one or three letter code, and# an optional site number, which can also be in a to-ken following the amino acid.
For cases where thesite entity is the word ?residue?
or ?residues?, welook for the amino acid definition in the precedingand following tokens.
All strings are canonicalizedwith removal of punctuation, hyphens and parenthe-sis before applying the rules.
In total, of the 177,994events with a site argument, 75,131 could be nor-malized to an amino acid, and 60,622 of these to aspecific residue number.3 ResultsThe source for extraction in this work is the set of 21million PubMed abstracts and 372 thousand PMCopen-access full-text articles.
From this dataset,1.4M EPI events and 2.2M REL relations were ex-tracted (Table 2).
For both tasks, about half of theresults were extracted from PMC, confirming thatfull-text articles are an important source of infor-mation for these extraction targets.
The total num-bers of events and relations are considerably lowerthan e.g.
the 21.3M events extracted for the GENIAtask from PubMed abstracts (Bjo?rne et al, 2010;Van Landeghem et al, 2012), likely relating to thecomparatively low frequency with which EPI andREL extraction targets are discussed with respect tothe basic GENIA biomolecular reactions.86Event type UniProt Events Match Coverage Events (site) Match CoverageHydroxylation 1,587 14,555 1,526 19 4,298 130 5Phosphorylation 57,059 726,757 286,978 4,795 86,974 9,732 748Ubiquitination 792 74,027 4,994 143 10,562 54 20Glycosylation 6,708 154,523 18,592 897 22,846 68 31Acetylation 6,522 114,585 15,470 764 25,689 158 30Methylation 1,135 122,015 2,178 113 27,625 36 10Total 73,803 1,206,462 329,738 6,731 177,994 10,178 844Table 3: PTM events.

Column # shows the number of extractedevents, followed by the event with the highest confidence score and the PubMed abstract or PMC full-text article it hasbeen extracted from.873.1 Extracted PTMs compared to UniProtThe EPI PTM events were compared to annotatedPTMs from UniProt (Table 3).
The majority of ex-tracted PTM events (85%) have only a protein ar-gument, and no information about the modificationsite, so these can only be compared by the proteinid and PTM type.
For the subset of proteins thatalso have a site, which can be normalized to anamino acid position, we can make a detailed com-parison with UniProt.
Finding a match for thesenormalized amino acids is more difficult, and forboth categories, only a small fraction of proteinsfrom UniProt is covered.
In part this may be dueto the limitations of the gene name normalization, asfinding the exact species-specific protein ID remainsa challenging task (Lu and others, 2011).
How-ever, even if the overall coverage is limited, well-known protein modifications can be assigned to spe-cific residues, as we show in the next section.3.2 Extracted PTMs for a single proteinFor an in-depth example of PTM modifications, westudy the protein p53, a central tumor suppressorprotein that is the subject of many studies.
p53 isalso among the proteins with the most UniProt PTMsites for which EPI events were predicted, making ita good example for a case study (see Table 4).We take from UniProt all known p53 PTMs corre-sponding to our EPI event types and list the numberof predicted events for them (see Table 4).
Whenthe number of predicted events is high, the mostconfident prediction is usually a correctly extracted,clear statement about the PTM.
All events for PTMsknown in UniProt are correct except for the typeof K386.
For events not in UniProt, the two S15ones are false positives, and K372 acetylation, whilecorrectly extracted, is most likely a typo in the arti-cle.
For the PTMs for which no event was extracted,we checked the reference article from UniProt an-notation.
K291, K292 ubiquitination, and K305 arefrom abstracts, and thus missed events.
S183, S269and T284 are from a non-open access PMC article,while S99, K292 acetylation, K305, S314 and K381are from Excel or PDF format supplementary tables,sources outside our extraction input.In total, we have extracted 561 PTM events re-lated to p53, 554 of which correspond to a PTM an-Item PubMeth Extracted RecallPMID+UPID 2776 1698 61.2%UPID 392 363 92.6%PMID 1163 1120 96.3%Table 5: Evaluation of DNA methylation event extractionrecall against PubMeth.notated in UniProt.
Of the 28 EPI-relevant PTMs onp53, 17 have at least one predicted event.
The high-est confidence events are about equally often fromabstracts as from full texts.3.3 DNA methylation analysisTwo recently introduced databases, PubMeth (On-genaert et al, 2008) and MeInfoText (Fang et al,2011) provide manually curated information onDNA methylation, primarily as it relates to cancer.To evaluate the coverage of DNA methylation eventextraction, we focus here on PubMeth, as the fullcontent of this database could be directly used.
EachPubMeth DB record provides the primary name ofthe methylated gene and the PMID of the publica-tion supporting the curation of the record.
We usedthese two pieces of information to evaluate the recall6 of DNA methylation event extraction.We mapped PubMeth entries to UniProt iden-tifiers (UPIDs), and extracted all unique (PMID,UPID) pairs from both PubMeth and the automat-ically extracted DNA methylation/demethylationevents.
The results of comparison of these sets ofID pairs are given in Table 5.
We find that for over60% of PubMeth entries, the system is able to re-cover the specific (document, gene) pair.
This resultis broadly in line with the recall of the system asevaluated in the BioNLP ST.
However, if the match-ing constraint is relaxed, asking either 1) can the sys-tem extract the methylation of each gene in PubMethsomewhere in the literature or, inversely, 2) can thesystem detect some DNA methylation event in eachdocument included in PubMeth as evidence, recallis over 90%.
In particular, the evaluation indicatesthat the system shows very high recall for identify-ing documents discussing DNA methylation.6As PubMeth does not aim for exhaustive coverage, preci-sion cannot be directly estimated in this way.
For example, Pub-Meth covers fewer than 2,000 documents and DNA methylationevents were extracted from over 20,000, but due to differencesin scope, this does not suggest precision is below 10%.88REL Type Extracted Match (p) Match (e)Prot-Cmp 1613.1K 561.8K 150.7KSU-Cmplx 537.6K 226.5K 99.6KTable 6: Numbers of extracted entity relations, with theprotein (p) or both protein and entity (e) identified.3.4 REL statisticsTable 6 presents the amount of extracted entity re-lations and the coverage of the normalization algo-rithms assigning protein, domain and complex iden-tifiers.
From a total of 537.6K Subunit-Complex re-lations, 226.5K (42%) involve a protein that could beunambiguously identified (Section 2.3.1).
From thissubset, 99.6K relations (44%) could be assigned to aPDB complex identifier (Section 2.3.2), accountingfor 3800 representative 3D protein structures.The Protein-Component relations are much morefrequent in the data (1.6M relations) and here 35%of the relations (561.8K) involve a normalized pro-tein mention.
The assignment of InterPro domainsto these Protein-Component relations (Section 2.3.3)further covers 150.7K relations in this subset (27%),identifying 5500 distinct functional domains.
Thevast majority of these annotations (99%) are pro-duced by matching the lexical context against theInterPro descriptions, and only a few cases (200)matched against the amino-acid pattern.4 ConclusionsWe have combined state-of-the-art methods forgene/protein name normalization together with thebest available methods for event-based extractionof protein post-translational modifications, reactionsrelating to the epigenetic control of gene expres-sion, and part-of relations between genes/proteins,their components, and complexes.
These methodswere jointly applied to the entire available litera-ture, both PubMed abstracts and PMC full-text doc-uments, creating a text mining dataset unique in bothscope and breadth of analysis.
We further performeda comprehensive analysis of the results of this au-tomatic extraction process against major biologicaldatabase resources covering various aspects of theextracted information.
This analysis indicated thattext mining results for protein complexes, substruc-tures and epigenetic DNA methylation provides al-ready quite extensive coverage of relevant proteins.For post-translational modifications, we note thatcoverage still needs to be improved, but concludethat the extracted events already provide a valuablelink to PTM related literature.
In future work wehope to further extend the event types extracted byour PubMed-scale approach.
