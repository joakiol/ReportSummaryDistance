MID Tower, 2-1-61 Shiromi,Higashi-ku, Osaka 540 JapanAbstractA method of generating a Japanese sentence byinferring function words from content words usingvalency pa~terns is presented.A procedure for selecting an appropriate functionword, on the assumption that correct content words havebeen selected for a given phrase lattice, is described.
Amethod ol ~ inferring a correct verb when verbs arerecognized less accurately than nouns by the speechrecognition system is described.
Sentences are producedfrom content words as inputs by using the valencypatterns ohtained from collected dialogue sentences in arestricted 1ask domain.
Using the semantic features ofpreceding nouns and valency patterns allow a \[airlyrestricted number of candidate verbs to be inferred.This method eliminates possible errors at theinterface between speech recognition and machinetranslation (component technologies of an AutomaticTelephone Interpretation system) and selects the mostappropriate candidate from a lattice of typical phrasesoutput by 1he speech recognition system.1 Background and problemsAn Automatic Telephone Interpretation system is afacility which enables a person speaking in one languageto communicate readily by telephone with someonespeaking another.
Three constituent technologies arenecessary for such a system: speech recognition, machinetranslation, and speech synthesis.Basic research in each of these technologies todevelop an interpretation system between Japanese andEnglish has already started.
For this purpose, however, aneffective interface between speech recognition andmachine translation is vital because output from thespeech recognition module will inevitably contain errorswhich the machine translation module cannot accept.This paper proposes a method of generatinq aJapanese sentence by inferring function words fromcontent words using valency patterns.
This technique isaimed at the selection of the most appropriate candidatefrom a typical phrase lattice that may result from a speechrecognition system.2 Basic assumptionsIn this study the following restrictions relevant tothe interface problem are assumed:(1) A Japanese sentence usually consists of a certainnumber of noun phrases followed by a verb phraseat the end.
The basic unit of speech recognition isassumed to be a continuously uttered phrase, sothat any input to the machine translation module isa 'phrase lattice', i.e., a set of phrase candidateshypothesized by the speech recognition module.

('When is the deadline for a manuscript?
')Usually a Japanese phrase begins with a jiritsugo-word (J-word for short) such as a noun or verb, and endswith a sequence of fuzokugo-words (E-words for short)such as postpositional particles or auxiliary verbs.
In theabove notation, boundaries between J-words and F-words are explicitly indicated by hyphens, and all F-wordsare italicized.Figure 1 shows an example of a phrase lattice forthis sentence obtained as the result of speech recognition.Notice that there are candidates for both J-wordsand F-words together with a recognition score of theprobability that the word is correct.
The problem is toselect the most appropriate candidate from this phraselattice.3.2 Selection-by-generation approachAttention is focused on candidates for F-words,assuming that J-words have already been correctlyselected by a suitable method.The assumption that J-words have been correctlyselected is realistic if the task domain is limited enough toa l low a high recogni t ion rate for J-words and aknowledge-base, etc.
is available for the limited taskdomain.
Techniques related to this procedure are nowbeing studied.
Of the J-words, the predicate atthe end ofa sentence is less accurately recognized by the speechrecognition module than nouns.
A method to solve thisproblem will be discussed in the second half of this paper.In Figure 1, for instance, it is assumed that asequence of J-words:'c)enkou' 'shimekiri' 'itsu'(manuscript') ('deadline') ('when')has been correctly selected according to the recognitionscores.
Corresponding to these J-words, there are threesets of candidates for F-words in the phrase lattice:'wo '  'wa '  'desuka''too' ' ga" "deshita ''no'  "bekika'.Our major concern here isthe subproblem of selecting themost appropriate one in each of these sets.This sub-problem is characteristic of the Japaneselanguage.
In fact, as easily seen in the above example,frequently used F-words, specifically those indicatinggrammatical cases such as 'ga', "wo', "ni', etc., are tooshort to be recognized correctly.
Their recognition scoresare much lower than those of J-words.
But in Japanese itis often possible to infer the meaning of a given sentencefrom the sequence of J-words when the task domain isnarrow.2P)2Our method of selecting the correct F-words iscomposed of two steps: 1) generate a meaningfu lsentence by inferring suitable F-words for a givensequence of J-words, and 2) compare these inferred F-words with the candidates in the phrase lattice to selectthose most appropriate.This idea of 'selection-by-generation' distinguishesthis approach from previous ones: Hayes et al \[1\] forEnglish or Niedermair \[2\] for German.
In this paper onlyStep 1, which is considered the key step, will be discussed.4 Generating a sentence by inferring F-wordsThe task domain is restricted to inquiries about aninternational conference, and therefore the dialogue isbasically a repetition of simple questions and answers.This increases the probability of inferring the correct F-words for each phrase.4.1 Key information for the inferenceThe fol lowing types of information are used to inferF-words.
The information is described in a lexicon of J-words.
(1) Semantic features of nouns and valency patternsFirst, two types of semantic features are set up fornouns appearing in the restricted task domain.
One is ageneral type of semantic feature, independent of the taskdomain, such as abstract, action, concrete, human,location, time, number and diversity.
The other is aspecific type of semantic feature dependent on the taskdomain.
Table 1 shows examples of such features.Using these semantic features valency patterns ofthe basic predicates necessary in the task domain aredefined.
As an example, the predicate 'okuru' ('send' inEnglish) is given the fol lowing valency patterns:N\[con/ - t ra\ ] 'wo'  + V,N\[con/ - t ra\ ] 'wa'  + N\[ Ioc\] 'ni '  + V,N\[con/ - t ra\ ] 'wa'  + N\ [hum\] 'n i '  + V,N\[con/-tra\] 'wa" + N\ [ t im/pro \ ] 'maden i '  + V,N\[ t im/pro \ ] 'madeni"  + N\[con/ - t ra \ ] 'wo'  + V,N \ [hum\] 'n i '+  N\[con/ - t ra\ ] 'wo'  + V,N \ [hum\] 'ga '+ N\[con/-tra\]'wo' + V,N\[hum\]'ga' + N\[con/-tra\]'wo' + N\[hu m/-pro\]'ni' + V,N\[hum/-pro\]'wa' + N\[con/-tra\] 'wo '  + N\[h um\]'ni'+ V,etc..The first valency pattern in this list, for instance, specifiesthat the predicate V ('okuru') can take one noun phraseconsisting of a noun with the general semantic feature'concrete' / specific semantic feature non-'transport' andF-word 'we' .In this way the valency patterns summarize the basicJ-word and F-word relationships, and thus give the mostessential information for inferring F-words from a givensequence of J-words.gener___a/abstractTable 1 Semantic featuresspecific examplelogic 'riron'(theory), 'houhou'(method)state 'yousu'(state), 'baai'(case)'language 'nihongo'(Japanese), 'eigo'(English)learning 'bunya'(field), 'senmon'(specialty)intention 'kyoumi'(interest), 'kibou'(hope)value 'hitsuyou'(necessity)sign 'namae'(name)labor 'youken'(business)concrete document 'genkou'(manuscript),'youshr(form)transport 'basu'(bus), 'tikatetsu'(subway)article 'syashin'(photograph).___money.

If necessary, certain modifications such asomission of the nominative case, modification of theword sequence or of the F-words, and addit ion ofinterrogative pronouns are carried out.
In dialoguesentences, the nominative case such as 'watashi' (T) or?anata' ('you') is seldom used; hence, the nominative caseis usually not included in the valency patterns.
To describethe modification of the two valency patterns for 'okurU'('send'):N\[tingpro\]'madeni" + N\[con/-tra\]'wo' + V (a)N\[con/otra\]'wa' + N\[tim/pro\]'madeni' + V (b)If the noun N\[con/-tra\] of the valency pattern (a) becomesthe subjec% the F-word is replaced with 'wa'and the wordsequence is changed, often resulting in the valencypattern (b).
Interrogative pronouns are added to producevalency patterns specific to interrogative sentencesbecause a large number of questions occur in this taskdomain.In a \]imited task domain, even individually optionalcases behave in a similar way to the obligatory case foreach predicate.
Therefore,  the opt iona l  cases aredescribed in these valency patterns.
When valencypatterns were prepared for  65 words work ing  aspredicates, an average of about 11 valency patterns wereproduced for each predicate.
Details wi l l  discussed inChapter 5.
(2) Connection of two nouns by F-word 'no"it is inferred that nouns which cannot be processedthrough valency patterns are likely to be connected withthe F-word 'no' (roughly corresponding to 'of' in English)in the form 'A no B', where A and B denote nouns.
For agiven noun A, the other noun B can also be specifiedthrough the semantic features.
For instance, the noun'kaigr ('conference') can be joined with other nouns asfollows:'kaigi' + 'no' + N\[hum/hum\],'kaigi' + "no' + N\[abs\],'kaigi' + 'no' 4.
N\[tim/tirn\],'kaigi' + 'no' + N\[Iodins, pos\],N\[abs\] + 'no' + 'kaigi',N\[num/amo\] + "no' + 'kaigi', etc..As shown above, whether or not to insert the F-word "no" is automatically determined by presettingwhich nouns are to be connected with the F-word "no'.
(3) Syntactic informationPure syntactic knowledge is also useful in thisprocess.
It is known that, in Japanese, no F-word can beattached to an adverb or a conjunction, and that a verb inconditional form can be connected with an adjective viaF-words such as'ba'.In addit ion,  the fo l lowing  rules are used, forexample:Continuative verb form + F-word + verb--> conjunctive particle 'te',Conclusive verb form + F-word + verb-~ conjunctive particle 'to',Continuative verb form + F-word + adjective-~ conjunctive particle 'te',conjunctive particle " temo ',Attributive verb form + F-word + noun--7 no F-word, etc..4.2 Outline of the process of inferring F-wordsFigure 2 (a) illustrates a process of inferring F-wordsin a Japanese sentence:'kaijyou-de kaigi-no yousu-worokuonshi-temo ii,desuka',(May I record the speech of the conferenceatthe hall?
).In this case it is assumed that J-words 'kaigi', 'yousu','rokuonshi', and 'ii' are correctly recognizable.The inference proceeds as fol lows: 1) syntacticinformation can connect 'rokuonshi' and 'ii' with F-words'te" or "temo' and 'desuka' to generate the phrases' rokuonshi - te '  or ' rokuonshi - temo'  and "ii.desuka',' 293respectively, 2) considering the semantic features of thefirst three J-words, and taking the fourth J-word'rokuonsuru' as V, the valency pattern:N\[Ioc\]'de' + N\[act,abs\]'wo' + V,can be applied to them, 3) there are two possibleconnections: 'kaigi-no yousu' and 'kaijyou-no kaigi', and4) considering both 2) and 3) together, sentences:'kaijyou-(de, no) kaigi-no yousu-worokuonshi-(te, temo) ii-desuka',can finally be derived.In a similar way, (b) shows how the fo l lowingsentence is to be processed:'genkou-wa itsu-madeni okure.bayoroshii-desuka ',(By what time may I send the manuscript ?
).Here, 1) 'okure' is combined with 'yoroshii' by the F-words'ha' and 'desuka', to yield 'okure-ba yoroshii-desuka', 2)analyzing the semantic features of the nouns 'genkou'and 'itsu' and the presence of the verb 'okuru', thefollowing valency pattern is applied:N\[conl-tra\]'ha" + N\[timlpro\]'madeni' + V.3) Since the nouns 'genkou' and ' i tsu'  cannot beconnected by the F-word "no', 4) the following sentence:'genkou-wa itsu-madeni okure-bayoroshii-desuka',is finally obtained.5 An experiment to produce sentences from valencypatternsUsing the valency patterns obtained from collecteddialogue sentences, we carried out an experiment ofproducing sentences.
Of the total of 256 interrogativesentences, 146 were used in determining valencypatterns.
The number of verbs was 65 and that of nounswas 229.
In total, 669 valency patterns were prepared(10.7 patterns for each verb on the average).In addition to the collected dialogue sentences, weprepared 70 test questions.
For these interrogativesentences, we carried out a sentence-producingexperiment.

For example, the number 7 shownfor the first trial in the line corresponding to 5 candidatesentences means the number of candidate sentences was5~ and that 7 of the 70 test sentences were correct ones.The lower half of Table 2 shows the number of testsentences in'tr ials where no candidate sentence wasproduced or where none of the candidate sentencesproduced were correct.The figures for the second and subsequent trials inTable 2 show the change' in the correct answer rate whenadditional valency patterns were used to increase theinc idence o f  correct sentences.
In this experiment, enoughvalency patterns were added so th'at the sixth trial alwaysproduced correct sentences.AI~ elf the  test  sentences used in the aboveexper iment  were simple interrogat ive sentences.
Asshown in Table 2, t i le Use of ~alency patterns allows easyproduction of a complete sentence from a given sequenceof J-words.6 Inferring an omi t ted  verbThe verb in a given sequence of J-words has animportant  role in this method because it a l lows theselection of a correct valency pattern.
It would he difficultto proceed by this method if the verb is omitted for somereason, such as speech recognition failure, or if it wereor ig inal ly  omi t ted  as is of ten the case in Japanesedialogue.However, in this restricted domain,  nouns w i thpart icu lar  semantic features are o f ten re lated toparticular verbs.
For example, as shown in Figure 3, insentences which contain a noun w i th  the semanticfeature of concrete/document, he noun + F-word 'wo'tends to be accompanied by the verb 'okuru'('send'),'kaku'('write') or 'motsu'('have'), and the noun + F-word'h i '  tends  to  be accompan ied  by the  verb'kinyuusuru'('enter').This suggests the possibility of inferring an omittedverb from the nouns by inversely applying a suitablevalency pattern.
In fact, the def in i t ion  of a valencypattern can be generalized as follows:N\[sem Iglsem Is\] + N\[sem2glsem2s\] -t .... + V\[v-class\],where V\[v-class\] denotes a verb belonging to verb class 'v-class'.
This valency pattern can be used to infer a verb V\[v-class\] associated wi th  a set of nouns N\[semlglsemls\] ,N\[sem2glsem2s\], etc..This is schematically illustrated in Figure 4.
Whenthere is a verb group A (consisting of verbs which areinferred when a certain F-word is added to noun A) and averb group B (consisting of verbs which are inferred whena certain F-word is added to noun B),the common area ofthese two groups indicates the verbs which are inferredfrom the valency pattern containing noun A and noun B.For example, in a sentence which contains a noun'setsumeisyo' ~ e r b'genkou' ~ ~ ~ )\[concreteldocument "l )'tourokuyoushi' ~ ~/erb ~ ....... \' '~sh i 'Figure 3 Frequent combinationsof r~ouns and verbs295'moushikomiyoushi''temoto'\[somontic  eoturoA J /  oncrete,do  meot'WO''ni''aru'a'Figure 4 Verbs defined by multiple nounswith the semantic features of concrete/document and anoun with the semantic features of location/position,verbs such as 'aru'('be') and 'motsu'('have') tend to beselected, and F-words specific to these verbs are chosen.Table 3 shows the number of verbs which areinferred from a given sequence of nouns using thevalency patterns described in Chapter 5.
Since valencypatterns were prepared for 65 verbs, the verbs areinferred -from these 65.The columns in Table 3 Show the number of verbsinferred.
The lines in the same table show the number ofnouns in the valency patterns.
For example, when thenumber of inferred verbs is 5, there are 6 valency patternswhere 5 verbs are inferred; and of these 6 patterns 1 hasone noun, 4 have 2 nouns, 1 has 3 nouns and none have 4nouns.In counting the number of inferred verbs, only verbshaving a valency pattern consistent with given valencypatterns are counted.
When the noun of a valencypattern bears a specification as to the upper-level generalsemantic features but no specification as to the lower-task~dependent semantic features, the verbs of thevalency patterns bearing a specification as to the  lower-evel semantic features are counted.
Conversely, forvalency patterns where the lower-level semantic featureis specified, the verbs bearing no specification as to theIower.-levei semantic features are not counted.
Forexample, in the fo l lowingtwo valency patterns, the #erbsVl and V2 are inferred from the pattern (a), while onlythe verb V2 is inferred from the pattern (b).N\[con\] + N\[Ioc\] + Vl  (a)N\[con/doc\] + N\[Ioc\] + V2 (b)As can be seen in Table 3, only one verb was inferredin more than 50% of the valency patterns.
Irl 90% of theremaining valency patterns where multiple verbs werein~erred, the number c~f verbs i~fe~rred was 6 o~ le~s.
