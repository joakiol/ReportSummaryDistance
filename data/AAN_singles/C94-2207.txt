R. ChinaAbstractThis paper introduces a semantic theo-ry I)I,PW, l)ynamic l,ogic with PossibleWorld, which extends Groenendijk's I)PI,and Cresswell's Indices Semantics.
Thesemantics can interpret the temporal andmodal sense and anaphora.Key words:  Semantic Model, Dynamicl,ogic, Possible Worlds.?
1 In t roduct ionAt present here are three main aspectsin semantical field:1.
Transformation of' sentences or dis-courses into formulas in high order logic.2.
Semantic interpretation of the logicalformulas.3.
Semantic ambiguity.This paper presents the semantics,dynamic logic with possible world, whichcombines DPI J  3~ with Indices semantics r'~and extends the theories, the theory can beused to interpret the temporal and modalsense and anaphoric connection.
For thelimitation of space we only give the defi-nitions and examples concerned rather thanpresent a formalization which should inc-lude the axioms and rules concerned like uI)pL TMFollowing Montague semantics, the dis-cussion on meaning of a sentence startedwith predicate formula, high order logicalformual with lambda terms, which is trans-lated from a sentence S by means of a set ofrules and reduced to a f rs t  order predicateformula A finally.Problem= given an expression A, meani-ngEA~=?
Assume that a model M is anordered pair (D, F) where D is a domain, anon-empty  set and F an interpretationfunction assigning a semantic value to eachnon- log ica l  constant of the language.
Avalue assignment g is a function assigning amember of D to each variable of the lan-guage.
W is a possible world.
The inten-sion of the expression A is Int\['A~-----IIAII M*.
The extension of the expression A isExt EA, W\ ]=Int  EA\](W)= IIAII .

.Some semantic evaluations are as fol-lows :I. Montague Semantics, given M, W,evaluates extension IIA IIM'W'~.2.
Possible World Semantics (M. J. Cre-sswell), given M, W, finds the set ofpossible worlds which satisfy the extensionof h.  i .e .
,  {Wl\[lAl\[M'W~-=True}.3.
I)ynamic Predicate I,ogic (J. Groenendi-jk), given M, W, finds dynamic changesbetween the value assignments:\]lAll~'W= {(g~.,, go,,tS}.4.
Dynamic Logic with Possible World,given M, finds dynamic changes betweenthe ordered pairs of value assignment andworld: IIAII u=: r t(G~,,, G,,~}lG,~=(gi~, W~,,},(L,,= <g .... w,,o0}.The evaluations 1, 2 above are in staticsense and for use of interpretation ofsentences without anaphora, while evalu-1267ations 3, 4 above in dynamic sense and foruse of interpretation of anaphoric connec-tion.?
2 DLPW, Anaphor ic  Connect ionIn this section we hope that DLPW canoffer a successful application to anaphoricconnection like the intepretation of thefamous donkey sentence in Groenendijk'sDPL TM.
The sentence(1) There was a key, it is lost.can be formalized as(2) P-~key(x)  & NOW lost(x) (in thehope that) having the same semantic inter-pretation as the formula(3) PB~(key(x) & NOW lost(x)).The idea will come true by means ofdynamic logic DLPW.
A state, denoted by n(=<a, g)), may be a pair of a sequence oftime a(a=-{a(O), a(1)}) and a value assign-ment g.There are revisions of semantic de-finitons of operators concerned.

(8) II{0(x)ll={<~,, ~DI~,=~,g~= g2, g,(x)~F(ep)}.Where F(~0) is a set of individuals, F isthe function in a model M. {p is an atomicformula.
Here obviously, conjunction istreated like composition ( i.e., compoundstatement {S~, S~}).
Intuitively, the con-junction is treated in the sequential sense.The meanings of the formulas a,\[ l /0\] ,?l\[term t/0\], g,\[x\] follow the statements inthe preceding section.Assume that initially for all i, j,ai(j)~t0 and a~, gi in n~ denoted componentsconcerned.
