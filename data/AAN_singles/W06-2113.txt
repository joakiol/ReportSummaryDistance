English prepositions are trans-lated to Bengali by attaching appropriateinflections to the head noun of the prepo-sitional phrase (PP), i.e., the object of thepreposition.
The choice of the inflectiondepends on the spelling pattern of thetranslated Bengali head noun.
Furtherpostpositional words may also appear inthe Bengali translation for some preposi-tions.
The choice of the appropriate post-positional word depends on the WordNetsynset information of the head noun.Idiomatic or metaphoric PPs are trans-lated into Bengali by looking into a bi-lingual example base.
The analysis pre-sented here is general and applicable fortranslation from English to many otherIndo-Aryan languages that handle prepo-sitions using inflections and postposi-tions.1 IntroductionPrepositions have been studied from a variety ofperspectives.
Both linguistic and computational(monolingual and cross-lingual) aspects ofprepositions have been contemplated by severalresearchers.
Jackendoff (1977), Emonds (1985),Rauh (1993) and Pullum and Huddleston (2002)have investigated the syntactic characteristics ofpreposition.
Cognitive theorists have examinedthe polysemous nature of prepositions and ex-plored the conceptual relationships of thepolysemy, proposing the graphical mental im-ages (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980; Brugman, 1981,1988; Herskovits, 1986; Langacker, 1987; Tylerand Evans, 2003).
Fauconnier (1994) and Visettiand Cadiot (2002) have canvassed the pragmaticaspects of prepositions.
A practical study of theusage of prepositions was carried out for the pur-pose of teaching English as a second language(Wahlen, 1995; Lindstromberg, 1997; Yates,1999).
The deictic properties of spatial preposi-tions have been studied by Hill (1982), while thegeographical information provided by them wasan interest of computational research (Xu andBadler, 2000; Tezuka et al, 2001).In the fields of natural language processing,the problem of PP attachment has been a topicfor research for quite a long time, and in recentyears, the problem was explored with a neuralnetwork-based approach (Sopena et al, 1998)and with a syntax-based trainable approach (Yehand Vilain, 1998).
Although past research hasrevealed various aspects of prepositions, there isnot much semantic research of prepositionsavailable for computational use, which requires avigorous formalization of representing the se-mantics.
A recent semantic study of prepositionsfor computational use is found in (Voss, 2002),with a focus on spatial prepositions.
Spatialprepositions are divided into three categories ac-cording to which one of the two thematic mean-ings between place and path they acquire whenthey are in argument, adjunct and non-subcategorized positions of particular types of89verbs.
The semantics of spatial prepositions dealtwith in (Voss, 2002) is not lexical but thematic.There are some prepositions (e.g., over, with),which have many senses as preposition.
By mak-ing use of the semantic features of the Comple-ments (reference object) and Heads (verb, verbphrase, noun or noun phrase governing a preposi-tion or a PP), the meaning of the polysemousprepositions can be computationally disambigu-ated.
The different meanings of over call for dif-ferent semantic features in its heads and com-plements [Alam, 04].Prepositional systems across languages vary toa considerably degree, and this cross-linguisticdiversity increases as we move from core, physi-cal senses of prepositions into the metaphoricextensions of prepositional meaning  (metaphoror rather, idiomaticity is one of the main realmsof usage with prepositions) (Brala, 2000).The present study focuses on the lexical mean-ings of prepositions rather than on the thematicmeanings because it is intended for use in anEnglish-Bengali machine translation (MT) sys-tem, where the meaning of a sentence, a phraseor a lexical entry of the source language must bepreserved in the target language, even though itmay take a different syntactic form in the sourceand target languages.
Bengali is the fifth lan-guage in the world in terms of the number of na-tive speakers and is an important language inIndia.
It is the official language of neighboringBangladesh.
There is no concept of prepositionin Bengali.
English prepositions are translated toBengali by attaching appropriate inflections tothe head noun of the PP, i.e., the object of thepreposition.
The choice of the inflection dependson the spelling pattern of the translated Bengalihead noun.
Further postpositional words mayalso appear in the Bengali translation for someprepositions.
The choice of the appropriate post-positional word depends on the WordNet (Fell-baum, 1998) synset information of the headnoun.
Idiomatic or metaphoric PPs are translatedinto Bengali by looking into a bilingual examplebase.A brief overview of the English-Bengali MTSystem is presented in Section 2.
Different typesof English prepositions and their identification inthe MT system are described in Section 3.
Inflec-tions and postpositions in Bengali are outlined inSection 4.
Translation of English prepositions toinflections and postpositions in Bengali are de-tailed in Section 5.
The conclusion is drawn inSection 6.2 A Brief Overview of the English-Bengali MT SystemThe handling of English prepositions duringtranslation to Bengali has been studied with re-spect to an English-Bengali MT system (Naskarand Bandyopadhyay, 2005) being developed.
Inorder to translate from English to Bengali, thefirst thing we do is lexical analysis of the Englishsentence using the WordNet, to gather the lexicalfeatures of the morphemes.
During morphologi-cal analysis, the root words / terms (includingidioms and named entities), along with associ-ated grammatical information and semantic cate-gories are extracted.
A shallow parser identifiesthe constituent phrases of the source languagesentence and tags them to encode all relevantinformation that might be needed to translatethese phrases and perhaps resolve ambiguities inother phrases.
Then these phrases are translatedindividually to the target language (Bengali) us-ing Bengali synthesis rules.
The noun phrasesand PPs are translated using Example bases ofsyntactic transfer rules.
Verb phrase translationscheme is rule based and uses Morphologi-cal Paradigm Suffix Tables.
Finally, those targetlanguage phrases are arranged using someheuristics, based on the word ordering rules ofBengali, to form the target language representa-tion of the source language sentence.3 Prepositions in EnglishA preposition is a word placed before a ?noun?to show in what relation the noun stands withregard to the other noun and verb words in thesame sentence.
The noun that follows a preposi-tion, i.e., the reference object is in the accusativecase and is governed by the preposition.
Preposi-tions can also be defined as words that beginprepositional phrases (PP).
A PP is a group ofwords containing a preposition, an object of thepreposition, and any modifiers of the object.Syntactically, prepositions can be arrangedinto three classes ?
simple prepositions (e.g., at,by, for, from etc.
), compound prepositions andphrase prepositions.
A compound preposition ismade up of a set of words which starts with andacts like a preposition (e.g., in spite of, in favorof, on behalf of etc.).
A phrase preposition is asimple preposition preceded by a word from an-other category, such as an adverb, adjective, orconjunction (e.g., instead of, prior to, because of,according to etc.
).Frequently prepositions follow the verbs to-gether forming phrasal verbs and remain sepa-90rate.
A word that looks like a preposition but isactually part of a phrasal verb is often called aparticle.
E.g.
?Four men held up the bank.?
Hereheld up is a verb [?to rob?].
Therefore, up is nota preposition, and bank is not the object of apreposition.
Instead, bank is a direct object of theverb held up.
A particle may not always appearimmediately after the verb with which it makesup a phrasal verb (e.g., Four men held the bankup.
).An idiomatic (metaphoric) PP starts with apreposition, but its meaning cannot be ascer-tained from the meaning of its components.
Ex-amples of idiomatic PPs are: at times, by hook orcrook etc.All these syntactical characteristics are used toidentify prepositions in the English-Bengali MTsystem.
Moreover, the inventory of prepositionsin English is a close set.
So, identification ofprepositions is not much of a problem in English.A simple list serves the purpose.
The preposi-tions, compound prepositions, phrase preposi-tions and idiomatic PPs are identified duringmorphological analysis.
Some of the phrasalverbs (when the phrasal verb appears as a whole)are identified during the morphological analysisphase and some during parsing (when the parti-cle does not accompany the verb).However, there are some words that act asprepositions and fall into other POS categories aswell.
For example, the word before can be usedas an adverb (e.g., I could not come before),preposition (e.g., He came before me) or a con-junction (e.g., He came before I came).
Simi-larly, the word round can be used as an adjective(e.g., Rugby is not played with a round ball),noun (e.g., Rafter was knocked out of the tour-nament in the third round), adverb (e.g., Theyhave moved all the furniture round), preposition(e.g., The earth revolves round the sun) and verb(e.g., His eyes rounded with anger).
But depend-ing on the POS of the neighboring words/terms,the parser easily identifies the correct POS of theword in the particular context.A preposition is usually placed in front of (is?pre-positioned?
before) its object, but some-times however may follow it (e.g., What are youlooking at?).
The preposition is often placed atthe end when the reference object is an interroga-tive pronoun (e.g., Where are you comingfrom?)
or a relative pronoun (e.g., My grandfa-ther was a collector of coins, which we used tofight over).
In such cases, the system finds outthat the preposition is not a particle and is notfollowed by a noun either, so it must be astranded preposition.
It searches the pronoun(relative or interrogative) that appears at its leftand relates the stranded preposition to the pro-noun.
Thus during translation, the followingconversion takes place.
(1) Where are you comingfrom?
??
From where are youcoming?
(2) My grandfather was acollector of coins, which weused to fight over.
??
Mygrandfather was a collectorof coins, over which we usedto fight.But if the pronoun is missing, then the systemhas to find out the elliptical pronoun first.
(3) I am grateful to the manI have spoken to.
?
I amgrateful to the man [whom] Ihave spoken to.
?
I amgrateful to the man to[whom] I have spoken.Prepositions represent several relations withthe nouns governed by them.
Spatial and tempo-ral prepositions (which indicate a place or timerelation) have received a relatively in-depthstudy for a number of languages.
The semanticsof other types of prepositions describing manner,instrument, amount or accompaniment largelyremain unexplored.
In case of an MT system,when a preposition has different representationsin the target language for different relations indi-cated by it, identification of the relation is neces-sary.
The WordNet synset information of thehead noun of the PP, i.e., the object of the prepo-sition serves to identify the relation.4 Inflections and Postpositions in Ben-galiIn Bengali, there is no concept of preposition.English prepositions are handled in Bengali us-ing inflections (vibhaktis) to the reference objectsand/or post-positional words after them.
Inflec-tions get attached to the reference objects.
Aninflection has no existence of its own in the lan-guage, and it does not have any meaning as well.There are only a few inflections in Bengali: ?
(null), -?#(-e), -?^ (-y), -?
?^ (-ye), -?T?
(-te), -?#?T?
(-ete), -?E?
(-ke), -??[?
(-re), -?#??[?
(-ere),-?[?
(-r) and -?#?[?
(-er) (an inflection is repre-91sented as a word with a leading ?-?
in this paper).The placeholder indicated by a dashed circlerepresents a consonant or a conjunct.
For exam-ple, if -?# inflection is attached to the word[??L??[?
(bazar [market]) the inflected word is[??L???[?
(bazar-e [market-to]).
On the other hand,post-positional words are independent words.They have meanings of their own and are usedindependently like other words.
A post-positionalword is positioned after an inflected noun (thereference object).
Some examples of the post-positional words in (colloquial) Bengali are: ?V?
?^(diye [by]), ?U?E?
(theke [from]), LX?
(jonno[for]), E????K?
(kachhe [near]), a?
]?X  (samne [infront of]) etc.5 Translating English prepositions toBengaliWhen an English PP is translated into Bengali,the following transformation takes place: (prepo-sition) (reference object) ??
(reference object)[(inflection)] [(postpositional-word)].
The corre-spondence between English prepositions andBengali postpositions (inflections and post-positional words) is not direct.
As far as the se-lection of the appropriate target language repre-sentation of a preposition is concerned the refer-ence object plays a major role in determining thecorrect preposition sense.
Deciding whether thepreposition is used in a spatial sense, as opposedto a temporal or other senses, is determined bythe semantics of the head noun of the referenceobject.
A noun phrase (NP) denoting a placegives rise to a spatial PP.
Similarly, an objectreferring to a time entity produces a temporalexpression.
These relationships can be estab-lished by looking at the WordNet synset informa-tion of the head noun of the PP.5.1 Translating English prepositions usingInflections in BengaliThe translation of the three English prepositions'in', 'on', and 'at' involves identifying the possibleinflection to be attached to the head noun of thePP.
No postpositional words are placed after thehead noun for these prepositions.
The threeprepositions 'in', 'on', and 'at' (which are bothspatial and temporal in nature) can be translatedinto the Bengali inflections '-?#' (-e), '-?T??
(-te),-?#?T?
(-ete) and '?^ '  (-y).
Any of these 4 Bengaliinflections can be placed after the reference ob-ject for any of these 3 English spatial and tempo-ral prepositions.
The choice depends on the spell-ing of the translated reference object.
The rule is:if the last letter of the Bengali representation ofthe reference object is a consonant, ??#?
(-e) or -?#?T?
(-ete) is added to it (e.g., at/in market?[??L???[?
[bazar-e / bazar-ete]), else if the last let-ter of the Bengali word is a matra (vowel modi-fier) and if the matra is ?#??
(-a), any of ??T??
(-te), or  '?^ '  (-y) can be added to the Bengali ref-erence word (e.g., in evening?
a?????T?
/ a????
?^[sandhya-te / sandhya-y]), otherwise '?T??
(-te) isadded to it (e.g., at home?
[???Q???T?
[badi-te]).When translating the temporal expressions, if?on?
is followed by a day (like Sunday, Mondayetc.)
or by a date in English, null inflection isadded.To translate this type of PPs, we take the helpof an example base, which contains bilingualtranslation examples.
Here are some translationexamples from the example base (TLR ?
targetlanguage representation of the reference object).

Totranslate this type of PPs, we take the help of anexample base, which contains bilingual transla-tion examples.
Here are some translation exam-ples from the example base (TLR ?
target lan-guage representation of the reference object).
(1) before (artifact) ??
(TLR) - ?

Y??[??
[ - ( r / er/ yer ) pare ](5) since (place / physicalobject / time) ??
(TLR) ?U?E?
[theke]The choice of inflection depends on the spell-ing of the translated reference object as said be-fore.
If the translated reference object ends witha vowel, ??^?[?
is added to it; else if ends with aconsonant, ?#?[?
(er)is added to it; otherwise (itends with a matra) ?[?
(r)is appended with it.
Thepostpositional word is placed after the inflectedreference object in Bengali.
The choice of thepostpositional word depends on the semanticinformation about the reference objects as col-lected from the WordNet.
In cases with onepostpositional word, there is no need to know thesemantic features of the reference objects.
Forexample, ?since?, as a preposition, is alwaystranslated as ?U?E?
(theke) in Bengali, irrespec-tive of the reference object.
Again in some cases,this semantic information about the referenceobject does not suffice to translate the preposi-tion properly.Consider the following examples that includethe preposition before in two different senses.
(1) He stood before thedoor.
??
?a V?[?L??[?
a?
]?X V??Q??
?_(se [he] darja-r samne [thedoor before] dandalo[stood])(2) He reached before eve-ning.

?a L?X?[?
%?
?G ?Yg??K?
?_ (se [he]jan-er age [John before]pouchhalo [reached])From the WordNet, the system acquires thesemantic information that ?door?
is a hyponym of?artifact?, whereas ?evening?
and ?me?
(whichrepresents a person) are not.
Thus ?with?
is trans-lated to Bengali as - ?[?

?G insentence (2) and (3).As there is no ambiguity in the meaning ofcompound prepositions and phrase prepositions,a simple listing of them (along with their Bengalirepresentations) suffices to translate them.
Wehave prepared a list that contains the phraseprepositions and compound prepositions in Eng-lish along with their Bengali translations.English Bengaliin spite of a???

Thesimplest way to tackle them is to maintain a list-ing of them.
A list or a direct Example Base isused which contains idioms, which start withprepositions, along with their Bengali transla-tions.
Such an idiom is treated like any other PPduring the word-reordering phase.
Here are someexamples of them:(1) at times ??

(matratirikto)6 ConclusionIn the present study, the handling of Englishprepositions in Bengali has been studied withreference to a machine translation system fromEnglish to Bengali.
English prepositions are han-93dled in Bengali using inflections and / or usingpost-positional words.
In machine translation,sense disambiguation of preposition is necessarywhen the target language has different represen-tations for the same preposition.
In Bengali, thechoice of the appropriate inflection depends onthe spelling of the reference object.
The choiceof the postpositional word depends on the se-mantic information about the reference objectobtained from the WordNet.AcknowledgementsOur thanks go to Council of Scientific and In-dustrial Research, Human Resource Develop-ment Group, New Delhi, India for supportingSudip Kumar Naskar under Senior Research Fel-lowship Award (9/96(402) 2003-EMR-I).ReferencesAlam, Yukiko Sasaki.
