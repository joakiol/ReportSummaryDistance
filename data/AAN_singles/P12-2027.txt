However, while themotivations for borrowing are well studied, includ-ing e.g.
the need to express concepts that do not havecorresponding expressions in the recipient language,and the social prestige associated with the other lan-guage (Hock and Joseph, 1996), the dynamics of thisprocess are poorly understood.
While mainstreampolitical debates often frame borrowing as evidenceof cultural or linguistic decline, it is particularly per-vasive in youth culture, which is often heavily influ-enced by North American trends.
In many countriesaround the globe, hip hop fans form communities inwhich novel, creative uses of English are highly val-ued (Pennycook, 2007), indicative of group mem-bership, and relatively frequent.
We therefore studywhich factors contribute to the uptake of (hip hop-related) anglicisms in an online community of Ger-man hip hop fans over a span of 11 years.2 The MZEE and Covo corporaWe collected a ?12.5M word corpus (MZEE) of fo-rum discussions from March 2000 to March 2011on the German hip hop portal MZEE.com.
A man-ual analysis of 10K words identified 8.2% of thetokens as anglicisms, contrasting with only 1.1%anglicisms in a major German news magazine, theSpiegel (Onysko, 2007, p.114).
These anglicismsinclude uninflected English stems (e.g., battle, rap-per, flow) as well as English stems with English in-flection (e.g., battled, rappers, flows), English stemswith German inflection (e.g., gebattlet, rappern,flowen ?battled, rappers, to flow?
), and English stemswith German derivational affixes (e.g., battlema?ssig,rapperische, flowendere ?battle-related, rapper-like,more flowing?
), as well as compounds with oneor more English parts (e.g., battleraporientierter,hiphopgangstaghettorapper, maschinengewehrflow?someone oriented towards battle-rap, hip hop-gangsta-ghetto-rapper, machinegun flow?).
We alsocollected a ?20M word corpus (Covo) of English-language hip hop discussion (May 2003 - November2011) from forums at ProjectCovo.com.3 Identification of novel anglicismsIn order to identify novel anglicisms in theMZEE corpus, we have developed a classifierwhich can identify anglicism candidates, includ-ing those which incorporate German material (e.g.,mo?chtegerngangsterstyle ?wannabe gangster style?
),with very high recall.
Since we are not interested inwell-established anglicisms (e.g., Baby, OK), non-English words, or placenames, our goal is quitedifferent from the standard language identificationproblem, including Alex (2008)?s inclusion classi-fier, which sought to identify ?foreign words?

Our finalsystem consists of a binary classifier augmentedwith dictionary lookup for known words and tworoutines to deal with German morphology (affixa-tion and compounding).The baseline classifier We used MALLET (Mc-Callum, 2002) to train a maximum entropy classi-fier, using character 1- through 6-grams (includingword boundaries) as features.
Since we could notmanually annotate a large portion of the MZEE cor-pus, the training data consisted of the disjoint sub-sets of the English and German CELEX wordlists(Baayen et al, 1995), as well as the words usedin Covo (to obtain coverage of hip hop English).We tested the classifier using 10-fold cross valida-tion on the training data and on a manually anno-tated development set of 10K consecutive tokensfrom MZEE.
All data was lowercased (this improvedperformance).
We excluded from both data sets4,156 words shared by the CELEX wordlists (suchas Greek/Latin loanwoards common to both lan-guages and homographs such as hat), 100 commonGerman and 50 common English stop words, all 3-character words without vowels and 1,019 hip hopartists/label names, which reduced the developmentset from 10K tokens, or 3,380 distinct types, to 4,651tokens and 2,741 types.Affix-stripping Since German is a moderately in-flected language, anglicisms are often ?hidden?
byGerman morphology: in geflowt ?flowed?, the En-glish stem flow takes German participial affixes.
Wetherefore included a template-based affix-strippingpreprocessing step, removing common German af-fixes before feature extraction.
Because of thepossibility of multiple prefixation or suffixation(e.g.
rum-ge-battle (?battling around?)
or deep-er-en(?deeper?
)), we stripped sequences of two prefixesand/or three suffixes.

flow|maschine|ma?ssig (?like a flow ma-chine?)c.
Rap|vollpfosten (?rap dumbasses?
)Since these contain features that are highly indica-tive of German (e.g.
-lich#, a?, and pf ), we devised acompound-cutting procedure for words over lengthl (=7): if the word is initially classified as German,it is divided several ways according to the param-eters n (=3), the number of cuts in each directionfrom the center, and m (=2), the minimum length ofeach part.
Both halves are classified separately, andif the maximum anglicism classifier score out of allsplits exceeds a target confidence c (=0.7), the orig-inal word is labeled a candidate anglicism.
Parame-ter values were optimized on a subset of compoundsfrom the development set.Dictionary classification When applying the clas-sifier to the MZEE corpus, words which occur ex-clusively in one of the German and English CELEXwordlists are automatically classified as such.
Thisimproved classifier results over tokens and types, asseen in Table 1 in the comparison of token and typeprecision for the dict/nodict conditions.Evaluation We evaluated our system by adjustingthe classifier threshold to obtain a recall level of 95%or higher on anglicism tokens in the development set(see Table 1).
The final classifier achieved a per-token precision of 70% (per type: 67%) at 95% re-call, a gain of 7% (9%) over the baseline.Our system identified 1,415 anglicism candidatetypes with a corpus frequency of 100 or greater, out136of which we identified 851 (57.5%) for further in-vestigation; 441 (31.1%) were either established an-glicisms, place names, artist names, and other loan-words, and 123 (8.7%) were German words.4 Predicting the fate of anglicismsWe examine here factors hypothesized to play a rolein the establishment (or decline) of anglicisms.Frequency in the English Covo corpus We firstexamine whether a word?s frequency in the English-speaking hip hop community influences whetherit becomes more frequently used in the Germanhip hop community.
We aligned four large (>1Mwords each) 12-month time windows of the Covoand MZEE corpora, spanning the period 11-2003through 11-2007.
We used the 851 most fre-quent anglicisms identified in our system to find106 English stems commonly used in Germananglicisms, and compute their relative frequency(aggregated over all word forms) in each Covoand MZEE time window.
We then measure cor-relation coefficients r between the frequency ofa stem in Covo at time Tt, fEt (stem), and thechange in log frequency of the corresponding an-glicisms in MZEE between Tt and a later time Tu,?

U?w and T?ware estimated from a bag-of-words model approxi-mating a Poisson process.We apply Altmann et al?s model to study the dif-ference in word dynamics between anglicisms andnative words.
Since we are not able to lemma-tize the entire MZEE corpus, this study uses the851 most common anglicism word forms identifiedby our system, treating all word forms as distinct.We split the MZEE corpus into six non-overlappingwindows of 2M words each (T1 through T6), cal-culate DUt (w), DTt (w) and log10 ft(w) within eachtime window Tt.
We again measure how wellthese variables predict the change in log frequency?
log10 ft:u(w) = log10 fu(w) ?
log10 ft(w) be-tween the initial time Tt and a later time Tu, withu = t + 1, ..., t + 3.When measured over all words excluding angli-cisms, log10 ft, DUt , and DTt at an initial time arevery weakly (0.0309 < r < 0.0692), but sig-nificantly (p < .0001) positively correlated with?
log10 ft:u.
However, in contrast to Altmann etal.
?s findings that DU and DT serve better than fre-quency as predictors of word fate, for the set of an-glicisms (Table 3), all correlations were both nega-tive and stronger, and initial frequency log10 ft (notdissemination) is the best predictor, especially as thetime spans increase in length.
That is, while mostwords?
frequency change cannot generally be pre-dicted from earlier frequency, we find that, for an-glicisms, a high frequency is more likely to lead to adecline, and vice versa.1.1A set of 337 native German words frequency-matched tothe most common 337 anglicisms in our data set patterns withthe superset of all words (i.e., is not well predicted by any of the137?

log10 f becomes longer, i.e., frequency and dis-semination effects on frequency change do not oper-ate as strongly in immediate time scales.2.5 ConclusionIn this study, we examined factors hypothesized toinfluence the propagation of words through a com-munity of speakers, focusing on anglicisms in a Ger-man hip hop discussion corpus.
The first analysispresented here sheds light on the lexical dynamicsbetween the English and German hip hop commu-nities, demonstrating that English frequency corre-lates positively with change in a borrowed word?sfrequency in the German community?this result isnot shocking, as the communities are exposed toshared inputs (e.g., hip hop lyrics), but the strengthof this correlation is highest in a two-year timespan,suggesting a time lag from the frequency of hip hopterms in English to the effects on those terms in Ger-man.
Future research here could profitably focus onthis relationship, especially for terms whose successin the English and German hip hop communities ishighly disparate.
Investigation of those terms couldsuggest non-frequency factors which affect a word?svariables) in this regard.2An analysis which truncated the forms in the first twotimespans to match the N of the third confirm that this increaseis not simply an effect of the number of cases considered.success or failure.The second analysis, which compared three mea-sures used by Altmann, Pierrehumbert, and Mot-ter (2011) to predict lexical frequency change, foundthat log10 f , DU , and DT did not predict frequencychange well for non-anglicism words in the MZEEcorpus, but that log10 f in particular does predict fre-quency change for anglicisms, though this correla-tion is inverse; this finding relates to another analysisof loanwords.
In a diachronic study of loanword fre-quencies in two French newspaper corpora, Chesleyand Baayen (2010, p.1364-5) found that high initialfrequency was ?a bad omen for a borrowing?
andfound an interaction effect between frequency anddispersion (roughly equivalent to dissemination inthe present study): ?As dispersion and frequency in-crease, the number of occurrences at T2 decreases.
?A view of language as a stylistic resource (Cou-pland, 2007) provides some explanation for thesecounter-intuitive findings: An anglicism which isused less often initially but survives is likely to in-crease in frequency as other speakers adopt it for?cred?
or in-group prestige.
However, a highlyfrequent anglicism seems to become increasinglyundesirable?after all, if everyone is using it, it losesits capacity to distinguish in-group members (con-sider, e.g., the widespread adoption of the term blingoutside hip hop culture in the US).
This circum-stance is reflected by a drop in frequency as the wordbecomes passe?.
This view is supported by ethno-graphic interviews with members of the German hiphop community: ?Yeah, [the use of anglicisms is]naturally overdone, for the most part.
It?s targetedat these 15, 14-year-old kids, that think this is cool.The crowd!
Ah, cool!
Yeah, it?s true?the crowd, evenI say that, but not seriously.?
-?Peter?, 22, beatboxerand student at the Hip Hop Academy Hamburg.In summary, the analyses discussed here lever-age the opportunities provided by large-scale cor-pus analysis and by the uniquely language-focusednature of the hip hop community to investigate is-sues of sociohistorical linguistic concern: what sortof factors are at work in the process of linguis-tic change through contact, and more specifically,which word-extrinsic properties of stems and word-forms condition the success and failure of borrowedEnglish words in the German hip hop community.138AcknowledgementsMatt Garley was supported by the Cognitive Sci-ence/Artificial Intelligence Fellowship from theUniversity of Illinois and a German Academic Ex-change Service (DAAD) Graduate Research Grant.Julia Hockenmaier is supported by the National Sci-ence Foundation through CAREER award 1053856and award 0803603.
