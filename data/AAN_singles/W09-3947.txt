We will present find-ings from a data collection carried out inthe DICO project1, where the dialogue be-haviour under high cognitive load is anal-ysed, and present a novel theory of howto distinguish between different types ofworkload.1 IntroductionIn-vehicle dialogue systems demand dialoguemanagement that takes the cognitive workload ofthe driver into consideration.
The primary task isthe driving, and therefore it is necessary to developa dialogue system that interferes as little as pos-sible with the driving task.
However, the driver?scognitive workload might increase for various rea-sons, and it is important to distinguish betweenworkload that is driving-induced (i.e.
due to, forexample, a heavy traffic situation) and workloadthat is dialogue-induced (i.e.
due to a complicateddialogue).
If the workload is driving-induced it isprobably necessary to pause the dialogue to enablefor the driver to concentrate on the driving task,whereas if the workload is dialogue-induced it isinstead necessary to facilitate the dialogue task,for example by reformulating a question.1www.dicoproject.org2 Data collectionDICO is a project that aims to develop a proof-of-concept demo system, showing how a spoken dia-logue system can be an aid for drivers.
To studyhow an additional distraction or increase in thecognitive load would affect a driver?s dialogue be-haviour, a data collection has been made.
The goalwas to elicit a natural dialogue (as opposed to giv-ing the driver a constructed task such as for exam-ple a math task) and make the participants engagein the conversation.The participants (two female and six male) be-tween the ages of 25 and 36, drove a car inpairs while interviewing each other.
The inter-view questions and the driving instructions weregiven to the passenger, hence the driver knew nei-ther what questions to discuss nor the route in ad-vance.
Therefore, the driver had to signal, implicitor explicit, when she wanted driving instructionsand when she wanted a new question to discuss.The passenger too had to have a strategy for whento change topic.
The reasons for this setup was toelicit a natural and fairly intense dialogue and toforce the participants to change topic and/or do-main (e.g.
to get driving instructions).The participants changed roles after 30 minutes,which meant that each participant acted both asdriver and as passenger.
The cognitive load of thedriver was measured in two ways.
The driver per-formed a Tactile Detection Task (TDT (van Win-sum et al, 1999)) 2, and workload was also mea-sured by using an IDIS system 3.2When using a TDT, a summer is attached to the driver?swrist.
The driver is told to push a button each time the sum-mer is activated.
Cognitive load is determined by measuringhit-rate and reaction time.3IDIS determines workload based on thedriver?s behaviour (for example steering wheel322The participants were audio- and videotaped,and then transcribed with the transcription toolELAN4, using an orthographic transcription.
Theannotation scheme was designed to enable analy-sis of utterances with respect to topic change foreach domain.Domain and topic was defined as:?
interview domain: discussions about the in-terview questions where each interview ques-tion was defined as a topic?
navigation domain: navigation-related dis-cussions where each navigation instructionbelonging to the same row in the given routewas defined as a topic?
traffic domain: discussions about the trafficsituation and fellow road-users where eachcomment not belonging to a previous eventwas defined as a topic?
other domain: anything that does not fitwithin the above domains where each com-ment not belonging to a previous event wasdefined as a topicTopics change has been coded as follows:?
begin-topic: whatever?
topic A (new)?
end-topic: topic A (finished)?
whatever?
interrupt-topic: topic A (unfinished) ?whatever?
resume-topic: whatever ?
topic A (unfin-ished)?
reraise-topic: whatever?
topic A (finished)Cognitive load has been annotated as:?
reliable workload: annotated when work-load is reliably high according to the TDT(reliability was low if response button waspressed more than 2 times after the event).?
high: high workload according to IDIS?
low: low workload according to IDISmovements or driver applying the brake).
Seehttp://www.roadsafe.com/news/article.aspx?article=2104http://www.lat-mpi.eu/tools/elan/Silence, regardless of length, has been coded asa pause.The annotation schema has not been tested forinter-coder reliability.
While full reliability test-ing would have further strengthened the results,we believe that our results are still useful as a basisfor future implementation and experimental work.2.1 High workload0%?5%?10%?15%?20%?TDT?

TDT+IDIS?Workload?Figure 1: Percentage of annotated workload time.Figure 1 shows workload measured uniqely byIDIS, uniqely by the TDT and annotations madeby IDIS and TDT jointly.The difference in annotation time can be ex-plained by the fact that IDIS analyses driving be-haviour while the TDT measures the driver?s re-action time.
IDIS is developed to decide whenit is suitable to show alarms that are non-critical(such as the indicator for low level of wind screenwasher fluid).
Since showing the alarm is nottime critical, IDIS does not measure the individualdriver?s workload directly.
Taking this into con-sideration, IDIS measurements alone might be toogeneral and approximate when it comes to adapt-ing a dialogue system to the driver?s cognitiveload.
However, neither IDIS nor TDT in isolationsay anything about what is causing the high cog-nitive load, only that something makes the driverunable to pay full attention to the task at hand.These differences can be used to decide what typeof workload the driver is experiencing, which willbe explained next.3 Workload managementTo determine type of workload, the dialoge man-ager could be extended with a Cognitive LoadManager (CLM) which has access to two work-load detectors, a Speech Analyser (SA) and a Vehi-cle State Analyser (VSA), see figure 2.Since the driver is talking to a dialogue sys-tem the most convenient method for determining323Speech?analyser?Vehicle?state?analyser?Cogni?e ?load?manager?ASR?Dialogue?manager?Figure 2: Architecture of the cognitive load man-ager.workload level would be to analyse the speech.Studies have for example shown that an increasednumber of disfluencies such as deletions can in-dicate increased workload (Shriberg, 2001; Lind-strom et al, 2008).
The driver might also makesudden changes of domain, e.g.
talk as if address-ing fellow road-users, to indicate that she is busysorting out a difficult traffic situation (Villing etal., 2008).
There are no commercial SA systemspresent today, however research has shown thatit is possible to detect workload by analysing thespeech signal (Yin et al, 2008).The VSA analyses the driving behaviour to findsigns of increased workload.
Variants of VSA-likemodules are a reality in the vehicle industry today.For example, if the driver puts the brake on, makesa left turn or manages the radio or the fan, it isassumed that the workload is high.The CLM collects data from the detectors anddetermines type of workload based on the com-bined signals from the SA and the VSA.
Type ofworkload can be set to driving-induced (workloadthat is affecting the driving performance, detectedby the VSA) or dialogue-induced (workload thatis not affecting the driving performance, detectedby the SA) based on four assumptions, shown inTable 1.4 Results4.1 High workload annotationsFigure 3 shows the number of instances ofhigh workload detected by IDIS alone (possi-bly driving-induced), by TDT alone (dialogue-induced) and by both IDIS and TDT jointly(driving-induced) for each domain.

The most frequent topic changes areshown in Figure 4.
Most interview related top-ics are discussed during dialogue-induced work-load, while traffic related topics are discussedduring driving-induced workload.
During possi-bly driving-induced workload the topics are fairlyequally spread.
These results are further discussedin (Villing, 2009).0%?20%?40%?60%?80%?100%?Dialogue?induced?Possibly?driving?induced?Driving?induced?Figure 4: Topic shift during high workload.Figure 5 shows the average duration of thedriver?s pauses.Figure 6 shows that the majority of driver utter-ances are produced during low workload.5 DiscussionFigure 5 and 6 shows that an analysis of the speechcan give clues about workload level.
The dura-tion of the pauses is increasing during high work-load, and especially during driving-induced work-load.
This supports our hypothesis that the dia-logue system should pause when the driver needsto concentrate on the driving task.
This trend canalso be derived from Figure 6, since the number324SA + VSA SA VSAdriver speaking driving-induced dialogue-induced false alarmdriver not speaking - - possibly driving-inducedTable 1: CLM output based on information from the SA and the VSA.0?0,2?0,4?0,6?0,8?1?1,2?1,4?1,6?1,8?Low?workload?

The driver seems to make fewest utterancesduring driving-induced workload.Looking at Figure 3, it seems like the VSA-like systems present today would benefit from co-operating with a system that is able to make adeeper analyse of the cognitive load of the driver.For example, the traffic domain holds almost nodialogue-induced workload annotations but sec-ond most driving-induced, supporting the theorythat people often make comments about the traf-fic situation to signal that they have to concentrateon the driving task.
The results, although tenta-tive, can be seen as an indication that it is possi-ble to distinguish between different types of cogni-tive load by analysing both driving behaviour andspeech, and that different types of workload de-mand different dialogue strategies.6 Future workNext we will analyse the DICO material regardinginterruptions, to find a relevant interruption placein the dialogue, i.e.
a place where it is most suit-able to pause in order to disturb the driver as littleas possible.The resumption behaviour will also be analysedto see who takes the initiative to resume the dia-logue and how it is done.
The findings will form abasis for a theory of in-vehicle dialogue manage-ment.ReferencesAnders Lindstrom, Jessica Villing, Staffan Lars-son, Alexander Seward, Nina Aberg, and CeciliaHoltelius.
