+81-492-96-6006AbstractThe paper presents a computational theoryfor resolving Japanese zero anaphora, basedon the notion of discourse segment.
We seethat the discourse segment reduces the do-main of antecedents for zero anaphora ndthus leads to their efficient resolution.Also we make crucial use of functional no-tions such as empathy hierarchy and mini-mal semantics thesis to resolve reference forzero anaphora \[Kuno, 1987\].
Our al)proachdiffers from the Centering analysis \[Walkeret al, 1990\] in that the resolution worksby matching one empathy hierarchy againstanother, which makes it possible to dealwith discourses with no explicit topic andthose with cataphora \[Halliday and Hassan,1990\].The theory is formalized through thedefinite clause grammar(DCG) formalism\[Pereira and Warren, 1980\],\[Gazdar andMellish, 1989; Longacre, 1979\].Finally, we show that graphology i.e., quo-tation mark, spacing, has an important ef-fect on the interpretation of zero anaphorain Japanese discourse.1 In t roduct ionOver the past years, schemes like Focusing and Cen-tering have dominated computational approachesto resolving anaphora \[Sidner, 1983; Walker et al,1990\].
Their success derives from the utility theyhave in identifying salient discourse ntities uch astopic and thereby locating the antecedent for ananaphor.
But they all suffer from the problem ofdirectionality; they process the text (the list of sen-tences) from left to right, picking out focus alongthe way and see if a anaphor corefers with a focusalready encountered.
With the one-way processing,forward-looking pronouns (cataphora) are not pos-sible to resolve.
Since Japanese has great tolerancewith forward reference, a proper theory of zero pro-nouns should meet the problem of directionality.In what follows, we discuss ome points about dis-course segment and zero pronoun in Japanese.
Webegin by introducing the idea of discourse segment.Consider the pair:(1) Taro-go sara<i>-wo dasi, Hanakonora plate ace prepare-and-go 02<i> ryori -wo morituketa.nora food acc arrangedTaro prepared the plates, Hanako arranged foodon them.
(2) Taro -ga sara<~> -wo dasi, Hanako<i> -watop01<i> 02<k> ryori-wo morituketa.Taro prepared the plates, Hanako arranged food.Here, 02 represents a suppressed expression.
It actsas an indirect object of the verb moritsuketa.
1 1and 2 are morphologically identical except that 1has ga (nominative marker) where 2 has wa (topicmarker).
But they differ widely in meaning:l im-plies that Hanako arranged food on the plates thatTaro prepared, the reading 2 does not imply; in 2,1Here and throughout, we intend the term 01 to rep-resent a zero pronoun for the subject, 02 for the indirectobject, and 03 for the direct object.315Hanako could have arranged food on plates some-body other than Taro prepared.
Now locating thedifference will involve the notion of discourse seg-ment.
A discourse segment is defined as a set ofsentences which appear in some region of text andwhich is delimited by a topic-particle wa.
Thus 2breaks up into two segments, a clause with Taro-gaand one with Hanako-wa;1, containing no wa-markedelement, forms a segment by itself.
Section 2.1 pro-vides syntactic definitions for the discourse segment.Another important feature of discourse segment isthat of complying with the Minimal Semantics The-sis (MST) \[Nomoto, 1992\], a functional property thatmakes a segment cohere.
The MST says, 'Assumeas identical any pair of zero pronouns if it is partof some segment and does not occur as argumentsfor the segment's predicate.'
Thus any pair of zeropronouns that fall into the domain of discourse seg-ment are taken to be coreferential, unless they occurfor the same predicate.
2 Significantly, the MST isamenable to syntactic treatment.In addition, we make use of ~he empathy hierarchyto choose between coreference relationships admittedby the MST.
We specify a predicate for the empathyhierarchy and resolve zero anaphora by unifying onepredicate's empathy hierarchy with another whichoccurs in the same segment.
Since unification is anon-directional operation, we are able to treat for-ward as well as backward reference.2 Theory2.1 Genera lA discourse segment (DS) is a two-part structureconsisting of head and body; a head is a nominalwith a wa marking; a body is a set of sentences, whichend with a period.
Note that an adjunctive clauseis not a sentence here, since it ends with connectiveslike .node because, .kara because/after, .to and-then,etc.
Formally, we assume sentence has the followinganalyses, which are given in the DCG formalism.
(3) S -> C+, N(pp:1~a).S -> C*, N(pp:~a) ,C+.S -> C+.c+ denotes one or more occurrences of clause, C* zeroor more occurrences of clause, and N (pp : wa) denotesa wa-marked nominal;pp:wa specifies that the at-tribute pp (for postposition) has wa for the value.3Letus define discourse segment by:2 \[Hobbs, to appear\] talks about the cognitive conomyin understanding discourse: it says in effect that coher-ence is the result of minimizing the number of entities indiscourse.3We take a wa-marked nominal to be a sentence adver-bial.
Thus our approach differs from the tiaditional gapanalysis of topic construction \[Kuroda, 1965; Inoue, 1978;Kitagawa, 1982; Gunji, 1987\], which assumes that a wa-(4) D -> S+.and text by(5) T -> D+.As discussed in section 1, we choose to restrict D tocontaining at most one ~1 (pp:wa).
We implement therestriction by way of some additions to the rule set3.
(6) a S(head:X) -> C+, N(morph:X,pp:wa).b S(head:X) -> C*, N(morph:X,pp:,a),C+.Here, the 6 rule takes care of inverted sentence andthe 6 rule non-inverted sentence.
The rule set 6enforces unification between the head value and themorph value, morph represents the morphology of thenominal; thus morph: ta ro  specifies that the associ-ated nominal has the morphology " ta ro" .Notice that unification fails on a multiply headedsegment.
A head attribute, once instantiated tosome value, will never unify with another.
Unifi-cation, therefore, acts to limit each segment in thediscourse to a single head.
Note also that an non-headed discourse, that is, discourse with no headedsegments, has a legitimate DS analysis, for unifica-tion is possible between empty heads.
The followinglists the rules for DS Grammar.
(7) T -> D+(head:_).D(head:X) -> S+(head:X).S(head:X) -> C+,N(morph:X,pp:wa).S(head:X) -> C*,N(morph:X,pp:wa),C+.S(head:_) -> C+.2.2 Headed vs. Non-Headed D iscourseThe discourse can he perfectly intelligible withoutan explicit topic or wa-nominal, which implies thata discourse segment may not be headed at all.
Itappears, however, that a discourse segment alwayscomes out headed except when there is no head avail-able in the text.
In fact, a segment associates witha head nominal regardless of where it occurs in thatsegment.

Ol<i> chotto terekusa katta.say pass slightly embarrased copnominal is dislocated from the sentence and leaves a gapbehind.
In fact the analysis meets some difficulty in ac-counting for the wa-nominal having semantic ontrol overa set of period-marked sentences.
cf.
\[Mikami, 1960\].Ours, however, is free from the problem, as we see below.316Because Taro gave him/her a favor of giving aseat, he/she thanked Taro, who was slightly em.barrassed.

Taro<i> -wa01<i> chotto terekusak -attn.Because Taro gave him/her a favor o/ givinga seat, he/she thanked Taro, who was slighauembarrassed.8, 9 and 10 each constitute a discourse segmentheaded with Taro.
4 A discourse can be acceptablewithout any head at all:(11) 01<i> 02<j> seki wo uzutte ageta node,seat ace give favor because01</> 02<j> orei -wo iwar eta.
01<i>thanks ace say passchotto terekusa kattaslightly embarassed copBecause he/she gave him/her a favor of giving aseat, he/she thanked him/her, who was slightlyembarrassed.The speaker of 11, or watashi I would be the mostlikely antecedent for the elided subjects here; who-ever gave the favor was thanked for the kindness.Let us say that a discourse is headed if each of itssegments i headed, and non-headed, otherwise.
Ourassumption is that a discourse is either headed ornon-headed, and not both (e.g.
figure 1, figure 2).
5Formally, this will be expressed through the valuefor the head attribute.
(12) T -> D(head:empty).An  empty-headed discourse expands into one seg-ment; its head value will be inherited by each of theS-trees down below.
Note that unification fails on4The Centeringalgorithm is not equipped to deal withcases like 9 and 10, where the backward-looking centerTaro refers back to an item in the previous discourse.sit is interesting to note that a multiple-head is-course may reduce to a single-head iscourse.
This hap-pens when discourse segments (DS) for a discourse, sharean identical head, say, Taro and head-unifies with eachother.
In fact, such a reduction is linguistically possibleand attested everywhere.
Our guess is that a repeateduse of the same wa-phrase may help the reader to keeptrack of a coreferent for zero anaphora.T / \D DI IslFigure 1: Unacceptable DS-tree.

.The rule says that each of the segments has a non-null specification for the head attribute.2.3 M in imal  Semant ics  Thes isMinimal Semantics Thesis (MST) concerns the wayzero pronouns are interpreted in the discourse seg-ment; it involves an empirical claim that the seg-ment's zeros are coreferential unless considerationson the empathy hierarchy (section 2.4) dictate to thecontrary.

Thenput in salt.
Add meat after 5 rain.We see that 14 constitutes a single discourse segment.According to the minimal semantics thesis, all of thezeros in the segment are interpreted as coreferential,which is consistent with the reading we have for theexample.
Here is a more complex discourse.317(15) Taro-wa 01<i> machi-niitte, 01<i> hukutop town to go cloth-wokatta.

Masakogot it for her birthday present and she was veryhappy.The first two zeros refer to Taro and the last two referto Masako.
But this is exactly what the MST pre-dicts; 15 breaks up into two discourse segments, onethat starts with Taro-wa and the other that startswith Masako-wa, so zeros for each segment becomecoreferential.2.4 Empathy  H ierarchyIt appears to be a fact about Japanese that thespeaker of an utterance mpathizes or identifies morewith the subject than with the indirect object; andmore with the indirect object than with the directobject \[Kuno, 1987; Kuno and Kaburaki, 1977\].
Infact, there are predicates in Japanese which are lexi-tally specified to take an empathy-loaded argument;yaru give and kureru receive are two such.
For yaru,the speaker empathizes with the subject, hut withthe indirect object, in the case of kureru.The relevance of the speaker's empathy to the reso-lution problem is that an empathized entity becomesmore salient than other elements in the discourseand thus more likely to act as the antecedent foran anaphor.
(16) Taro-ga Masako<j> -ni hon -wo kattenom to book acc buy-kureta.
Imademo 01<i> sono hon -wohelped still that book accdaijini siteiru.care keepTaro gave Masako a favor in buying her a book.She still keeps it with care.In 16, 01, subject of the second sentence, corderswith the indirect object Masako in the first sen-tence, which is assigned empathy by virtue of theverb kureta.Formally, we define the empathy hierarchy as afunction with three arguments.
6empathy(Z1, Z2, Z3)6The definition is based on the observation thatJapanese predicates take no more than three argumentroles.With the definition at hand, we are able to formulatethe lexical specification for kureru:V(empathy(hrg2, Argl, Arg3),subject : hrgl, obj ect2 : Arg2,object :Arg3) -> \[kureru\].yaru has the formulation like the following:V(empathy(hrgl, Arg2, hrg3),subj oct : hrgl, obj ect2: Arg2,object :Arg3) -> \[yarun\].Further, let us assume that variables in the em-pathy hierarchy represent zero pronouns.
If a vari-able in the hierarchy is instantiated to some non-zeroitem, we will remove the variable from the hierarchyand move the items following by one _position to theleft; we might call it empathy shift ing/  Now considerthe discourse:(17) 01</> 02<i> hon -wo yatta -node,book acc favored because01<k> 02<a> orei -wo iwareta.gratitude ace say cop'Because he/she gave a book to him/her, he/shewas thanked for it.
'(18) a empathy(01<i>, 02<j>, _)b empathy(01<k>, 02<9 >, _)18(1) corresponds to the empathy hierarchy for thefirst clause in 17; 18(b) corresponds to the hierarchyfor the second clause.
Unifying the two structuresgives us the correct result: namely, 01<i> - 01<k>,and 02<i> = 02<9 >.
Notice that zero items in thesegment are all unified through the empathy hierar-chy, which in effect realizes the Minimal SemanticsThesis.
As it turns out, the MST reduces the numberof semantically distinct zero pronouns for a discoursesegment to at most three (figure 3).

He got oneyesterday again and didn't go to school.Masako stays in a good health and has neverbeen sick with fin.
I often see her playingoutdoors."
Father said with a smile on hisface.Here are the facts:(a) zero anaphora occurring withinthe quotation (internal anaphora) are coreferentialeither with Taro or with Masako; (b) those occurringoutside (external anaphora), however, all refer to chi-chioya; (c) chichioya has an anaphoric link whichcrosses over the entire quotation; (d) syntactically,the quoted portion functions as a complement forthe verb -to itta.
It appears, moreover, that an in-ternal anaphor associates itself with Taro in case itoccurs in the segment headed with Taro, and withMasako in case it occurs in the segment headed withMasako.
Then, since the quoted discourse consists ofa set of discourse segments, it will be assigned to aT-structure.
But the structure does not extend overthe part 01 itta, which completes the discourse, forthe 01 corders with chichioya, and neither with Taroor Masako.
This would give us an analysis like onein figure 4.S Here and below we call a tree rooted at T a 'T-structure' and one rooted at D a 'D-structure'.TFigure 4: embeddingThe following discourse shows that the T-structurecan be discontinuous:\[a\] ~Masako<i> -ga kinou s igoto-wonora yesterday work accyasun'da -n'desuyo."

"Did she catch a cold f ", askedFather.01<i> corders with Masako, so \[c\] forms a T-structure with \[a\].
But the two are separated bya narrative \[b\].
Similarly, the coreference between03<k> and Hahaoya gives rise to a T-structure thatspans \[d\] and \[b\], but there is an interruption by nar-rative \[c\] (figure 5).TTTFigure 5: interleaving3.2 P rob lemThere is a curious interaction between a paragraph-break and a T/D-structure.
\[Fujisawa et al,1993\], for instance, observes a strong tendency thatJapanese zero anaphora are paragraph-bounded.The following is from Nihon Keizai Shinbun, aJapanese conomics newspaper.Kawamata Hideo<i>.

Therest appears as it does in the paper.\] From the waysame-index anaphora are distributed over the dis-course, it seems rather obvious that a paragraphbreak has an effect of marking a segment for thediscourse.
9 The present heory, however, fails to dealwith the situation like this; it simply assigns a singleDS structure to the discourse in question, giving awrong interpretation that zero anaphora present areall coreferential.
As it stands, nothing in the theoryprovides for treating graphological marks such as aparagraph break.
Yet, it is unclear to us whether aparagraph break is a signal for a I"- or D-structure.4 ConclusionWe have developed a computational theory for re-solving zero anaphora in Japanese, drawing on theresults from previous works on Japanese discourse\[Kuno, 1987; Kuno and Kaburaki, 1977\], etc).
A ma-jor departure from the traditional analyses of zeroanaphora lies in the reduction of the space of an-tecedents for zero anaphora.
This has been madepossible by adopting ideas like Discourse Segment,Minimal Semantics Thesis and Empathy Hierarchy.In particular, we have shown that the Minimal Se-mantics Thesis leads to reducing the number of an-tecedents for a segment to at most three.
Also shownin the paper is that the resolution of zero anaphorais part of parsing text, so no additional mechanism is9 We may note that a recursive mbedding of discourseof the sort we have discussed above is effected throughthe explicit use of quotation marks; their absence wouldlead to the outright nngrammaticality.needed.
Furthermore, the present heory comparesfavorably with the previous schemes like Focusingand Centering in that it is able to deal with forward-and backward-looking anaphora by virtue of the wayunification operates on the empathy hierarchy.Part of our discussion has touched on the effect ofgraphology on the semantics of discourse.
To date,no significant research has been done on that areaof academic interests.
The literature suggest hat inthe written language, texts, i.e., cohesive discourses,are marked through a variety of linguistic and non-linguistic means: non-alphanumeric characters (quo-tation marks, brackets, parentheses), graphic devicest indentation, tabulation, itemization), and so on Nunberg, 1990; Halliday and I-Iassan, 1990\].
Thusa discourse segment might qualify for the texthoodsince it has the property that zero pronouns are re-solved internally.
Its indicator is, of course, the topicparticle wa.
But for the T-structure, it is far fromclear whether it is anyway cohesive, and if it is, whatits indicators are.
(Quotation mark and paragraphbreak are possible candidates.
)Some of the technical as well as linguistic detailsare yet to be worked out; we have not talked abouthow the topic comes to be associated with one ormore zero pronouns in the segment.
Considerationson empathy may well influence the choice of pro-nouns to be matched with.Re ferences\[Fujisawa et al, 1993\] Shinji Fujisawa, Shigeru Ma-suyama, and Shozo Naito.
