A col locat ional  based approach to sal ience-sensit ivelexical select ionLeo WannerGMD/Institut ffir Integrierte Publikations-und InformationssystemeDolivostrafie 15D-6100 Darmstadt, W. Germanye-mail: wanner@ipsi.darmstadt.gmd.dbp.deAbstractIn this paper we address the organization and use of thelexicon giving special consideration tohow the salienceof certain aspects of abstract semantic structure maybe expressed.
We propose an organization of the lex-icon and its interaction with grammar and knowledgethat makes extensive use of lexical functions from theMeaning-Text-Theory f Mel'~uk.
We integrate this ap-proach with the architecture of the PENMAN text gen-eration system, showing some areas where that archi-tecture is insufficient, and illustrating how the lexiconcan provide functionally oriented guidance for the gen-eration process.IntroductionIn natural language generation, the lexicon can beviewed, generally, as containing information for theverbalization of meanings.
This information rangesover both the static organization of vocabulary - -including lexical knowledge, often handled separatelyas "lexical semantics" (see, e.g., \[Pustejovsky, 1988;Nirenburg and Raskin, 1987\]) or "structural semantics"- -  and the process of lexical choice.
To make allowancefor this latter dynamic aspect of the lexical organiza-tion we will henceforth use the term lexis common insystemic linguistics \[Hasan, 1987; Matthiessen, 1988\]instead of "lexicon".
Lexis thus represents lexical infor-mation at various different levels of abstraction (strata)and mapping structures that provide for the conversionbetween those levels.
In this paper we address the or-ganization of lexis giving special consideration to theexpresssion and choice of appropriate expressions as afunction of the desired salience or prominence ofseman-tic elements.
The choice set of possible configurationsof prominence we call the perspectives ofthe semanticstructure.These have been addressed rarely in approaches ingeneration so far: for example, \[Jacobs, 1985\] discussesthe verbs give and take as two different expressions ofthe same event; \[Nirenburg and Nirenburg, 1988\] sug-gest an approach to open-class lexical item selection forrealization of conceptual input; and \[Iordanskaja et al,John A. BatemanUSC/Information Sciences Institute4676 AdmirMty WayMarina del ReyCA 90292-6695, U.S.A.e-mail: bateman@isi.edu1988\] propose an approach to linguistic paraphrasingby adapting the Meaning-Text-Theory (MTT) \[Mel'~ukand Zholkovsky, 1970\] and its paraphrasing rules.
Here,we make more extensive use of the MTT in order toprovide a richer organization oflexis and its interactionwith grammar and knowledge than has been proposedpreviously.
Moreover, we develop this approach in thecontext of a concrete generation environment, the PEN-MAN system \[Mann and Matthiessen, 1985\], showingsome areas where the existing architecture is insufficientand how the richer organization oflexis we propose canhelp.The following set of examples gives an impression ofthe variety of linguistic phenomena that we include un-der the term perspective.
1 All the sentences can be in-terpreted as verbalizations ofa single abstract semanticstructure with differing aspects of that structfire beinggiven emphasis in each case.
For example, in (4), thereader is made salient as a participant of the propo-sition; in (5), the 'manner of achievement' of the 'in-dication' is made salient; in (7), a particular temporalaspect of the process, namely the beginning, is madeprominentput; and in (8), the intended purpose of theagent is made salient as a 'making clear'.
While thevariation that can be seen between (1), (2), and (3) canalready be treated in, for example, the current PEN-MAN system by exercising meaning options available inthe grammar (i.e., (2) exhibits passivization and (3)nominalization f 'use'), the variation shown in the re-maining examples cannot be functionally motivated aspossible alternate grammatical realizations of the basesemantic form.1.

the adjective "elec-tronic" as an indication that the dictionarses are deeplydedicated to computers.Some of the phenomena running through these ex-amples have been treated as lexleal eooeeurrenee\[Apresjan et al, 1969\] or collocation \[Firth, 1957;Halliday, 1966; Hausmann, 1985\]).
Most extensivelythey are handled by I. Mel'~uk et al in the scope ofthe Meaning-Text-Theory b  means of lexleal func-tions (LFs).
Our approach to generating this rangeof variation takes its starting point, therefore, fromthe notion of lexical cooccurrence r lations addressedby Mel'~uk.
There is a large body of descriptive workbased on the notion of LFs which has been carried outfor different languages \[Mel'~uk and Zholkovsky, 1984;Mel'~uk et al, 1988; Zholkovsky, 1970; Reuther, 1978;Janus, 1971\] and we will suggest how this body ofknowledge can now provide significant input to workon text generation.In the next section we give an introduction to LFs asthe means by which lexical cooccurrence dependenciesare expressed within the MTT; we then describe someproblems with the existing organization of LFs as de-fined by Mel'~uk eta/.
and show how that organizationcan be developed further to be used for the modeling ofvarious perspectives.
In the section following, we thendiscuss the influence of lexis, when enriched by perspec-tives, on the generation process and, subsequently, wepresent a detailed example of the guidance this pro-vides.The Nature and Organization of LexicalFunctionsLexical cooccurrence in the scope of MTT is providedin terms of lexical functions which Mel'~uk defines asfollows \[Mel'~uk and Polgu6re, 1987\]:aA lexical ~_nction f is a dependency that associates withlexeme L, called the argument of f, another iexeme(or a set of (quasi.
)synonymous iexemes) L' which ex-presses, with respect to L, a very abstract meaning ( .
.
.
)and plays a specific syntactic role.
For instance, tor anoun N-denoting an action, the LF Opera specifies averb ( .
.
. )
which takes as its grammatical subject thename of the agent of the said action and as its directobject, the lexeme N itself.The values for any particular application of a LF to alexeme are provided by an Explanatory Combina-torial Dict ionary (ECD); dictionaries of this type fora number of languages have already been compiled byMTT researchers.
Thus, for example, the ECD for En-glish provides for the following applications of the LFOperl:Operl (influence) = exertOperl (punishment} = administerThese give lexical verbs appropriate for use when theargument is to appear as a direct object o form a com-bination where an agent (optionally) acts upon somepatient; e.g.
: He exerted influence on P .
.
.
,  He ad-ministered a punishment .
.
.
,  but not, * he exerted apunishment .
.
.
,  * he administered an influence .
.
.
.Cooccurrence r lations of this kind are pervasive innatural anguage and need to be captured in the rep-resentation of a language's lexical resources.
Such co-occurrence relations can be rather arbitrary and so areunlikely to be supportable by, for example, distinctionsmaintained in the knowledge base.
Their meaning isnot, however, arbitrary.
An important claim of MTT isthat each LF represents a particular abstract meaningwhich remains invariant across its various applications.Thus, for example, further LFs include: Fuse0 withthe meaning 'something takes place' (Func0 (accident)= {occur, happen}, as in the sentence: The accidentoccured two hours ago.
); Result standing for a statefollowing the process addressed (Result (study) = mas-ter, as in the sentence: John mastered his subject.
); andLiqu expressing an active process termination.
Thislatter LF is often used in so called composed LFs wherea number of LFs are combined in a predefined order(LiquFunc0 (Fire) = {extinguish, put out}, as in thesentence: The fire brigade could put out the fire quickly).MTT classifies LFs into two general types: lex-ieal parameters,  which provide syntagmatie r la-tionships (e.g., Operi with i = 1,2,...), and lexi-eal substitutes, which provide paradigmatic relation-ships (e.g., Gener - -  a specific generalization rela-tion) \[Mel'~uk and Zholkovsky, 1970\].
However, sinceLFs typically correspond to knowledge at varying lev-els of abstraction in addition to lexical information,these classes are still very heterogenous.
Previous ap-roaches that have made use of LFs in generation (e.g.,ittredge and Mel'~uk, 1983; Iordanskaja et al, 1988;Bourbean et al, 1989\]) have been hindered by this.
Inorder to exploit the notion of LFs in generation moreextensively, we need further organizational principlesthat emphasize the meanings distinct LFs possess.Work in progress at IPSI suggests that the large num-ber of heterogeneous LFs used within MTT can be or-ganized coherently in terms of the functions and seman-tic distinctions that they represent.
Based on this, wehave defined part of a general model of lexis with ataxonomic organization underlying it, within which themost general structures provide the representations oflexical semantics and the most delicate ones lexicaliza-tion.
For the purposes of this paper, we will restrictattention to the organization of LFs that are particu-larly relevant for modeling situation perspectives a il-lustrated in our examples above.
In Figure 1 we set out32in network form general distinctive features that clas-sify the meaning that the LFs we discuss here cover.
2The network explicates LFs by classifying each of themaccording to a particular set of semantic features.
Thegeneral function of the network is thus to relate partic-ular LFs to the functional conditions for their applica-tion.
This defines the meaning that any LF expressesand so provides a functionally organized key into theLF-oriented ictionaries being developed within MTT.The network also shows the hierarchical arrangementlying behind the meaning of LFs and so reflects therelation of perspectives to one another.We will now briefly describe in semantic terms a rep-resentative set of the LFs covered by the network, show-ing how the network relates perspectival presentationdecisions to choices of LFs.
3 Then, with the organiza-tional network of perspectives in place and motivated,we show how it can be used to guide the generationprocess to produce the kinds of variation illustrated in(1)-(9).S i tuat ion  in t roduct ionOne of the basic terms used in the scope of MTT isthat of abstract situations, circumscribed, roughly, assomething that takes place.
In the sense of Mel'~uk,abstract situations are defined by key  te rms and theparticipants of the situations; the key term is designatedby the LF So, the participants as Si (i-th participantof the situation).
We view this construct here as anabstract semantic partial specification of what is to beexpressed linguistically.
Thus, looking at the situationof teaching, the ECD for English offers us:So (teaching) = teaching,$1 (teaching) = teacher,SO (teaching) = pupil.The notion of situational key terms is closely related toterm of processes in the tradition of Systemic FunctionalGrammar \[tlalliday, 1985; Steiner et al, 1987\].When a situation is introduced, this may be done re-specting a number of varying attributions Of saliencee.g., the salience of particular participants of a situationor the situation itself.The selection of particular combinations of processand participants for the realization of abstract situa-2The notation of Figure 1 follows that used within theNIGEL grammar of the PENMAN system for the specificationof grammar possibilities.
Names in capitals represent thenames of choice points, and names in lower case featureswhich may be selected: one from each choice point; alsosquare brackets represent disjunction of features and bracesconjunction.
Such networks can be readily expressed ina number of distinct formalisms, e.g., FUG (cf.
\[Kasper,1988\]), LOOM (cf.
\[Kasper, 19895\]).3In the full version of this network, the consequences ofeach possible selection of features for LF selection is spec-ified; space precludes a detailed discussion at this point,although examples are given below.tions according to differing attributions of salience isthen provided in the scope of the ECD by LFs of vari-ous groups.
For example: Func, which has the effect ofattributing salience to the term labeling the situation;Oper ,  which has the effect of attributing salience toone of the participants; and Labor  which has the ef-fect of attributing salience to a combination of the par-ticipants.
The selection of these broad groups is madein the network by the choices available under SITUA-TIONAL ORIENTATION, by the features 'situation ori-ented' (Func) and 'participant oriented' (Oper, Labor).These are further differentiated according to whichparticipants are affected; e.g.
: Operl makes the 'first'participant of the situation salient (i.e., the participantfor which the LF $1 provides a lexeme) and Oper2 the'second' (i.e., the participant for which the LF $2 pro-vides a lexeme): Oper2 (influence) = be under.
Simi-larly, Func0 makes the key term of the situation itselfsalient, while Func: introduces the situation with par-ticular respect o the first participant: Func0 (problem)= exist, FUnCl (problem) = come \[from\].
Labor12 makesthe first and the second participant salient, the firstmore then the second, Labor21, on the contrary, makesthe second participant more salient, e.g.
: Laborl2 (pres-sure) = bring to bear \[on\], Labor21 (pressure) = get\[from\].
These options are controlled by the further se-lections of participants to be accorded salience in thechoice points SITUATION ORIENTATION and PARTICI-PANT ORIENTATION.Finally, the third option in the SITUATIONAL ORIEN-TATION system, 'process orientation' is responsible forthe neutral LF V0, which provides the most direct lex-ical verb for realizing the key term of a situation; e.g.,Vo ( i.lzuence) = \[to\] influence.Tempora l  dependencyLFs also address the global arrangement ofa process onthe temporal axes by the definition of its preceding andsucceeding processes.
These considerations are reachedin the network by a feature selection of {global tempo-ral oriented, .
.
.
,  } from the alternatives of the TEMPO-RAL ORIENTATION choice point.
These alternatives callfor the application of the LFs P rox  and Perf ;  exam-ples of which from the ECD for English are: ProxFunc0(storm) = brew, Perf (storm) = subside.
In addition,the internal temporal aspects of a process, representedby its stages, axe reflected by the corresponding tripleof "phasal" LFs: Incep  for the beginning, Cont  forcontinuing, and F in  for the termination stage.
Thesemeanings are reached via the features under the 'stageoriented' option in the choice point PROCESS STAGESORIENTATION in the network.Resu l ts  and  consequencesSituations can also he expressed so as to give salienceto their results.
The treatment of this requires a con-sideration of the intended result of the situation33~CAUSALITYORI~TATIONCAUSATIONS ~ c~m~oa~ ~  ~'  cmmmicmsrruATIONAL I" ,~m,~-qalORm~rrATION |sn'OATION |II....

These options are found underthe  choice po int  INTERNAL ORIENTATION and RESULTORIENTATION.
If the result of the process was the in-tended result (i.e., the ~purpose' of the carrying outthe process), then the Real~, Labrealo, and Factsgroups of LFs are applicable; in the opposite case, theAntiReal~, AntiLabrealo,  and AntiFacti groups ap-ply.
Each of these groups provide further the salienceeither of the key term of the situation itself or of thevarious participants of the situation as determined bythe simultaneous selections of features made under (inthis sense Reali and AntiReali correspond to Operl,Labreal 0 and AntiLabrealff to Laboro, and Fact~ andAntiFactl to Funci).
For example: Real2 (order) =obey, AntiReal2 (order) = def~.Causa l i tySituations can also be expressed so as to make thecausality relationships that the situation enters into ex-plicit or not; these options are considered by the choicepoint CAUSALITY ORIENTATION, which is responsiblefor application of either the LF Caus or Perm.?
The Cans function provides an active causation of thesituation, as in the case of problem; e.g., CansFunc0(problem) = pose.?
Perm presupposes a 'permission', or allowance or ac-ceptance, of the occurrence of the situation; e.g.,PermPunco (problem) = tolerate.34Guiding the Generation Process byLexisThe concrete generation system in which we are realiz-ing organizational structures of lexis in order to sup-port the emphasis of various salience aspects of se-mantic structures is the PENMAN system \[Mann andMatthiessen, 1985\].
The linguistic core of PENMAN i8a large systemic-functional grammar of English, theNIGEL grammar \[Matthiessen, 1983\].
The semantic in-terface of NIGEL is defined by a set of inquiries whichmediate the flow of information ,between the grammarand external sources of information.
PENMAN providesstructure for some of these external sources of informa-tion, including a conceptual hierarchy of relations andentities, called the Upper Model (UM) \[Bateman et aL,1990; Bateman, 1990\]; the UM hierarchy classifies con-cepts according to their possibilities for realization innatural language and may be used as an interface be-tween the organizational structures of Domain Knowl-edge (DK) and the grammar's inquiries.
PENMAN ac-cepts demands for text to be generated in the notationof the PENMAN Sentence Plan Language (SPL) \[Kasper,1989a\].
SPL specifications are partial semantic repre-sentations of what is to be realized through the gram-matical resources of NIGEL.
More formally, SPL expres-sions are lists of terms describing the types of entitiesand the particular features of those entities that are tobe expressed in English.
The features of SPL termsare either semantic relations to be expressed, which aredrawn from the upper model or from domain conceptssubordinated to the upper model, or direct specifica-tions of responses to NIGEL'S inquiries.
4To generate any of the sentences (1)-(9) above usingPENMAN, therefore, we must define appropriate SPL in-put.
However, as mentioned in the introduction, theseinput specifications do not, at present, capture the gen-eralization that these sentences share significant aspectsof their meaning.
To capture this, while still maintain-ing complete functional control of the generator, we in-troduce a more abstract input specification, from whichparticular SPL specifications are constructed dependingon additional salience-oriented semantic distinctions.These semantic distinctions are specified in terms of thehierarchical organization of the meanings of LFs shownin the network of Figure 1.
This organization providesa statement of semantic feature interdependencies thatrepresents he perspectives available and the functionalmotivations for choosing one perspective over another.Each of the decision points in this network may placeconstraints on the mapping between the abstract in-put level and SPL.
These decisions themselves need tobe made by a text planning component - -  the networkrepresents the capability of generating variation under4For full details of the PENMAN system and its com-ponents, see the PENMAN documentation \[The PenmanProject, 1989\].control rather than the control process itself.
In thissense, lexis as the stratum containing perspective infor-mation provides a controlling mechanism for the gener-ation process entirely analogously to the grammaticalnetwork defined by NIGEL.Example of perspective-guidedgenerationWe now illustrate the realization of some chosen per-spectives in detail.
Consider the clauses (1), (4), (6),and (7) given above.
The SPL input specifications nec-essary to generate ach of these clauses are set out inFigure 2.
5 As we can see, there is no connection be-tween these since the generalization that they refer tothe same situation is captured neither within the gram-mar, nor the upper model.
Our new level of abstract in-put to the generation process, which corresponds morewith Mel'~uk's conception of 'abstract situation' intro-duced above, provides this connection as follows.
Ab-stract situations are represented in terms of a generaltype and a set of participants drawn from the lexemesdefined with respect o the Domain Knowledge; for ex-ample, the abstract input for the situation underlyingsentences (1), (4), (6), and (7) may be set out thus: 6SO useT $1 weT $2 adjective ' lectronic'So indicationT $2 readerTS3 \ [So(deep)  dedication\]T Ss T $1 dictionariesT $2 computersIn order to generate sentences from this specification,we need to construct appropriate SPL expressions.
Thiswe achieve by following the semantic alternatives madein the LF network of Figure 1, applying the constraintsthat it specifies to compose a mapping between the ab-stract input and SPL.Thus, for example, consider the context of use wherea text planner has determined, in addition to express-ing the situation shown in the abstract input, thatthat situation is to be presented textually as one inwhich the process is introduced neutrally, without re-spect for what preceded or succeeded, and with the pro-cess and the first participant (we: $1) made relativelymore salient.
This corresponds to the set of LF net--work features {non-causal oriented, non-stage oriented,global temporal oriented, current process, introductionoriented, process-oriented, 1st participant processual).5Note that in this figure, in order to save space, we sharethe vaxables re,  N1, A1, ASl across the distinct SPL spec-ifications; this would not normally be done.OThe notation T Si is used to indicate that the valuegiven is not the value of the LF Si itself, it is rather thevalue of the role that the LF delivers; i.e., $1 (use) is user.35(Cl / use:actor:actee:purpose(C2 / get :actor(C3 / illustrate(C4 / c reate(we / person)(N1 / ad jec t ive:name e lec t ron ic )(A1 / ind icate: ac tor  we: 8ubj ec t  -matt  e r(AS1 / dedicate:domain (dictionaries / thing):range (computers.

The ECD for the language then sup-plies a candidate lexical item - -  in this case, the processUSe.We integrate the information from the ECD by re-quiring lexical items to be linked to concepts which aresubordinated to the PENMAN upper model.
It is thenpossible to determine, by inheritance, the particular setof upper model/semantic role relations that are appro-priate for a process of any type.
The concept for useis classified as a nondirected-acf io,  in the upper modeland so the role-set :ac tor ,  :actee  is inherited.
Thefillers of these roles are then selected from the orderedset of participants specified in the abstract input under$1, $2.
The process then recurses for the complex fillerof $3 - -  filling, in this case, the :purpose upper modelrelation - -  and the SPL given in Figure 2 for sentence(1) is constructed.
7If the text planning component had determined thata different set of presentational LF features were neces-sary, then a different LF would be selected for applica-tion to the key-term of the abstract input.
Thus, withthe selection of the features {non-causal oriented, non-stage oriented, global temporal oriented, current pro-cess, result oriented, result intended, participant ori-ented, 1st participant oriented}, which expresses the7The association of the abstract situational roles S~ andthe roles drawn from the upper model in fact offers anothersignificant source of presentation variability which may alsobe addressed in terms of LFs.
We do not discuss this furtherwithin the confines of the present paper however.intended effect of the process use with salience on itsfirst participant, he LF Real1 is selected and, here, theECD gives the process illustrate.
This term is then,again, selected as the main term in the correspondingSPL specification and, as before, since it is also linkedinto the upper model, we know that the relevant roleset is :ac tor ,  :ac tee ,  :moans.
The further mappingof situational roles Si to available UM-roles then pro-vides the necessary fillers for the slots in the SPL.
Thisgives the SPL for sentence (6).In sentences (4) and (7), the interaction between thelexical network and the situation subordinated underSs in the abstract input is shown, s For the situation of'indication', then, when the LF features: {non-causaloriented, non-stage oriented, global temporal oriented,current process, introduction oriented, participant ori-ented, 2nd participant oriented} are required, express-ing that the situation is introduced with emphasis on itsinternal composition and participants and that the sec-ond of those participants i the more salient, then theLF Oper2 is selected for application to the filler of T $3(i.e., indication).
The ECD in this case supplies get.Note that here, the LF Oper2 also has consequences forthe latter mapping between situational roles and uppermodel roles; the key-term itself, So, is now associatedwith the role :actee.
This provides the SPL specifica-tion for sentence (4).SWork elsewhere (e.g., \[Bateman and Paxis, 1989\]) hasshown that propositionally embedded components of an in-put specification can be linguistically realized under certaintextual conditions as unembedded, or as dominating, con-stituents.
This is the case here, although space precludes amore thorough discussion.36Finally, with the selection of LF features {non-causaloriented, stage oriented, beginning, participant ori-ented, 1st participant oriented, global temporal ori-ented, current process, introduction oriented}, the LFIncepOperl is selected.
When this is applied to indica-tion, the ECD gives the process create and the SPL forsentence (7) is set up accordingly.ConclusionWe have shown how lexical cooccurrence r lations canbe used to express the salience of particular aspects ofabstract semantic structures and how their underlyingmeaning and communicative function can be organizedin order to influence the generation process.
A spec-ification of perspectival presentatation features as de-fined in the network of Figure 1 makes it possible togenerate rather varied surface realizational forms.
Wecan view this network as a candidate for the textualorganization \[Matthiessen, 1988\] of lexis - -  which com-plements the more traditional 'propositional' organiza-tion found in lexical discrimination ets (e.g., \[Gold-man, 1975\]) and thesauri.
The textual/communicativefunctional meanings of LFs we propose, although ar-guably inherent in the MTM, have not formerly beenextracted as an explicit principle of organization.
Wesuggest hat this kind of organization may substan-tiMly enhance the information collected by MTM re-searchers.
Finally, although we have restricted our-selves in this paper to details that are particularly rel-evant for modeling situation perspectives, we are work-ing towards a general model of lexis including, e.g., asemantically motivated classification of verbs, relations,etc.
as proposed by, for example, \[Matthiessen, 1988;Hasan, 1987\] and pursued in a computational contextby \[Fawcett and Tucker, 1989\].
For this we also use aset of further LFs represented on various levels of ab-straction.Acknowledgments.
