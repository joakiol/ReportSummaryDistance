Clustering MeSH Representations of Biomedical LiteratureCraig A. Struble, Chitti DharmanollaDepartment of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer ScienceMarquette UniversityMilwaukee, WI 53201-1881{craig.struble,chittithall.dharmanolla}@marquette.eduAbstractBiomedical literature contains vital informa-tion for the analysis and interpretation of ex-periments in the biological sciences.
Hu-man reasoning is the primary method for ex-tracting, synthesizing, and interpreting the re-sults contained in the literature, yet the rate atwhich publications are produced is exponen-tial.
With the advent of digital, full-text pub-lication and increasing computational power,automated techniques for knowledge discov-ery and synthesis are being developed to assisthumans in making sense of growing literaturedatabases.We investigate the use of ontological informa-tion provided by the Medical Subject Head-ings (MeSH) project to discover groupingswithin a collection of medical literature storedin PubMed.
Vector representations of docu-ments based on MeSH terms are presented.
Re-sults of agglomerative hierachical clustering ontwo collections of biomedical literature, the RatGenome Database and Tourette?s Syndrome re-lated research, suggest novel and understand-able groupings are obtainable.1 IntroductionIn recent years the amount of online documents hasgrown tremendously that poses challenges for informa-tion retrieval from this vast collection.
Text mining is theapplication of techniques of machine learning in conjunc-tion with natural language processing, information ex-traction and algebraic/mathematical approaches to com-putational information retrieval (Berry and Pottenger,2003).Two major subfields of text mining are document clas-sification and document clustering.
Document classifica-tion is the automated assignment of textual data to groupsor classes.
Supervised machine learning techniques, suchas neural networks or nearest neighbor classifiers, are of-ten employed in document classification.
Document clus-tering identifies groups of similar documents based onshared features, typically words contained in the docu-ments.
This differs from document classification in thattopic areas are unknown before clustering.An important consideration for document classifica-tion and document clustering is the representation of thedocuments for analysis.
Traditional approaches repre-sent documents by extracting features from the full-textcontents of each document.
These features may undergotransformations such as weighting or dimension reduc-tion with the goal of improving classification accuracy,improving clustering quality, or data reduction.Our goal is to explore Medical Subject Headings(MeSH), a controlled vocabulary for describing medicalliterature (National Library of Medicine, 2003), as fea-tures for document representation.
Exploring this use ofMeSH is important for two reasons.
First, MeSH termsare assigned to papers by trained indexers, thus many is-sues involved with natural language processing may beavoided.
Second, insights gained with MeSH based rep-resentations may be applied to other ontologies under de-velopment such as the Gene Ontology (The Gene Ontol-ogy Consortium, 2000).In this paper, we focus on the interplay between MeSHbased representations and document clustering.
Our ap-plication of document clustering is to identify and sum-marize potential topics within collections of medical lit-erature.
The outline of the rest of the paper is as fol-lows.
Section 2 discusses methods for obtaining docu-ment collections.
Representations of documents, includ-ing our proposed MeSH representations are described inSection 3.
Section 4 outlines the document clustering ap-proach used in our study.
Results from a comparativestudy and an exploratory study are presented in Section 5.Section 6 contains a survey of related work.
Conclusionsand future opportunities are discussed in Section 7.Association for Computational Linguistics.Linking Biological Literature, Ontologies and Databases, pp.
41-48.HLT-NAACL 2004 Workshop: Biolink 2004,2 Document CollectionsCollections of documents can be obtained by severalmeans.
In the simplest situation, any sample of docu-ments contained in PubMed can be obtained for the pur-poses of document clustering.
Such a sampling may pro-vide insight into the whole of PubMed, but is most likelynot useful for specific text mining tasks.A more useful approach for targeted text mining is tobuild a query or collection of queries centered around aconcept.
For example, in studying prostate cancer, thequery string prostate cancer is given to PubMed.
Thedocuments matching the query for prostate cancer areretrieved and processed for document clustering.
Theidentified clusters represent potential topics contained inprostate cancer research.
This approach has been used tobuild concept profiles for several text mining tasks (Srini-vasan and Wedemeyer, 2003; Srinivasan, to appear).Other possible methods for obtaining document col-lections exist as well.
In obtaining documents for agenome database, such as the Rat Genome Database(RGD) (Twigger et al, 2002), human curators combinequeries of PubMed with an exhaustive reading of a lim-ited number of journals.
This may be viewed as anotherform of a concept-based collection.
In this case, however,the collection captures several ill defined concepts; onesthat cannot be specified with a small number of PubMedqueries.This investigation considers both methods of obtainingdocument collections.3 Document RepresentationsRepresenting documents for clustering and other textmining tasks is a fundamental step in the knowledge dis-covery process.
The ability to derive useful informationfrom a document collection may be entirely determinedby the attributes used to describe the documents.
A com-monly used representation in text mining and informationretrieval is the vector representation.
A summary of vec-tor representations is presented below and refer the readerto a text on information retrieval (Korfhage, 1997) for amore detailed description.Suppose D is a collection of documents and T ={t1, t2, .
.
.
, tn} is the collection of unique terms appear-ing in at least one document in D. Obtaining T is typi-cally accomplished by extracting individual words (e.g.,characters between spaces) from the text (e.g.
titles, ab-stracts, and body) of each paper, although more sophisti-cated parsing may occur.
Individual words may be furtherprocessed by stop word removal, the removal of wordswithout inherent meaning such as articles or pronouns,and stemming, the removal of suffixes to extract only rootwords.
This term processing often generates better clas-sification and information retrieval results.Given T , a document d ?
D is represented as a vectorvd = ?w1, w2, .
.
.
, wm?, (1)where wi is called the weight of term ti within docu-ment d. Weights are defined based on specific applicationneeds.Two examples of commonly used weighting schemesare term frequency (TF) and term frequency inverse doc-ument frequency (TFIDF).
Let |ti| be the number of timesti appears in a document d, |D| be the number of docu-ments in the document collection, and ni be the numberof documents in D containing ti.
The TF scheme is de-fined by wi = |ti|.
The TFIDF scheme is defined bywi = |ti|/ log2(|D|/ni).Consider a document collection D with term collec-tion T = {cancer, diagnosis, medical, viral}.
If a docu-ment d contains three occurences of the term cancer, oneoccurence of the term diagnosis, four occurences of theterm medical, and no occurences of the term viral.
Therepresentation of d using TF weighting isvd = ?3, 1, 4, 0?.3.1 MeSH RepresentationsThis investigation builds on the vector space representa-tion of documents described above.
Instead of obtaininga term collection T from the full text of titles, abstracts,or content of a paper, T is built from the MeSH assign-ments for each document.
A summary of MeSH is givenbelow.Medical literature is indexed by MeSH terms by theNational Library of Medicine (NLM) for the purposeof subject indexing and searching of journal articles inPubMed (an online literature database that contains cita-tions from more than 4,600 biomedical journals).
MeSHterms are assigned to medical literature by human index-ers.MeSH consists of two ontologies: descriptors or head-ings are a collection of terms for primary themes or topicscontained in the literature; and qualifiers or subheadingsare terms combined with descriptors to indicate the spe-cific aspect of a descriptor.
Formally, a MeSH term is atuple (d, q) where d is a descriptor and q is a qualifier (qmay be empty if d is unqualified).
There exist 21975 de-scriptors and 83 qualifiers in the 2003 MeSH ontology,which was used in this study.Both descriptors and qualifiers are organized in di-rected acyclic graphs (DAGs), where the parent of a de-scriptor or qualifier is considered more general than theterm itself.
A descriptor (or qualifier) may have multi-ple parents, representing that the descriptor (or qualifier)includes multiple concepts in the MeSH ontology simul-taneously.
For example, in the 2003 MeSH ontology, de-scriptors have an average of approximately 1.8 parents.1Viral Diseases Bacterial Infections and Mycoses Parasitic Diseases Animal DiseasesSepsisInfection ZoonosesSepticemiaViremiaDiseases21111100 0Figure 1: A portion of the MeSH descriptor ontology.The numbers indicate the term weighting if Virema is as-signed to a document d.embryologyabnormalitiesanatomy & histology etiologyblood supplyFigure 2: A portion of the MeSH qualifier ontology.Portions of the descriptor and qualifier ontologies are dis-played in Figures 1 and 2.In MeSH representations, weights are derived from thestructure of MeSH.
Documents are represented as vec-tors where the term collection T consists of descriptorsonly, qualifiers only, or combined descriptors and quali-fiers (this will be further referred to as the combined rep-resentation).
Weights are defined bywi =??
?0 if term ti is not assigned1 if term ti is inferred2 if term ti is assigned.A term is inferred if one of its descendants in the MeSHhierarchy is assigned, but the term itself is not assigned.Consider d with the term Viremia assigned.
The de-scriptors only representation isvd = ?0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0?,where the columns correspond to Animal Diseases,Bacterial Infections and Mycoses, Diseases, Infection,Parasitic Diseases, Sepsis, Septicemia, Viral Diseases,Viremia, and Zoonoses respectively.
The relationshipbetween the MeSH hierarchy and the values assigned isdemonstrated in Figure 1.
In essence, the DAG structureis flattened, but allowable vectors for document represen-tation are restricted to the structure imposed by MeSH.4 Document ClusteringMany clustering algorithms have been proposed for doc-ument clustering.
In this study, AGNES (Kaufman andRousseeuw, 1990), an agglomerative hierarchical cluster-ing algorithm, with average linking was employed.
Usingthis algorithm has two advantages for this study.
First,dendrograms, a visualization of the substructures con-tained in a document collection, are produced.
Second,AGNES computes an agglomerative coefficient a. Letmd be the height at which d is first merged, and M is theheight of the final merge, thena = meand?D(1 ?mdM).Intuitively, the agglomerative coefficient measures the av-erage similarity of d to the members of the first clustercontaining d, normalized to a [0, 1] range.
For documentcollections of approximately equal size, a larger a indi-cates better clustering quality (Kaufman and Rousseeuw,1990).4.1 Dimension ReductionThe number of unique terms in document collection istypically large (> 1000), resulting in very high dimen-sional data.
Dimension reduction is commonly employedin text mining before further analysis.Principal components analysis (PCA) and related ap-proaches are methods for dimension reduction (Jolliffe,1986).
A full discussion of PCA is beyond the scope ofthis paper.
Several guidelines exist for PCA to determinethe number of dimensions to use.
In this study, principalcomponents are selected in descending order until 25%of the variation in the data is captured.4.2 Document SimilarityMany clustering algorithms require a measure of similar-ity between two documents be defined.
Euclidean dis-tance is one measure used in clustering applications.
An-other measure, used in information retrieval, is the cosinemeasure (Korfhage, 1997), which measures similarity bycalculating the cosine of the angle between the vector rep-resentation of two documents.
Cosine distance is used inthis paper.4.3 Cluster Identification and SummarizationFor MeSH representations, clusters are identified andsummarized to find interesting groups in the documentcollection.
Individual clusters are identified by cuttingthe dendrogram at different heights.
The clusters are thensummarized by computing the cluster center, a vectorconsisting of the mean term weights across constituentdocuments, using the full dimensional representation.Terms are ranked in descending order according to theresulting mean weight.5 Experiments and ResultsTwo document collections were analyzed using docu-ment clustering: documents in RGD (Twigger et al,2002), and documents retrieved by the PubMed query?Tourette?s Syndrome.?
Each data set is described inmore detail below.The following procedure was employed for each col-lection.1.
Documents are encoded in a vector representation.The term collection T is derived from terms in ab-stracts and titles, MeSH descriptors, MeSH qual-ifiers, or a combination of MeSH descriptors andqualifiers.For full-text, terms from abstracts and titles were ob-tained using rainbow with stop word removal andstemming options (McCallum, 1996).
TF weightingwas used.For the MeSH descriptors and qualifiers, the assign-ments were obtained from PubMed XML entries,and inferring was determined by the 2003 MeSH.2.
PCA was performed on the represented documents,and principal components capturing 25% of the datavariance were selected.
The documents were pro-jected onto the selected components.3.
The reduced dimension representation was clusteredby AGNES using average linking.
The cosine dis-tance measure was used for document similarity.4.
Clusters were identified and summarized.Computations were performed using R version1.7.1 (R Development Core Team, 2003).
Clustering wasaccomplished using the agnes function in the clusterpackage.
PCA calculations used the prcomp function inthe mva package.5.1 Rat Genome DatabaseThe Rat Genome Database (RGD) is a NIH (NationalInstitutes of Health) project developed at Medical Col-lege of Wisconsin (MCW) whose main objective is tocollect, consolidate and integrate data generated from ratresearch (Twigger et al, 2002).
Rat is the dominant pre-clinical model organism used to study human diseases in-volving heart, lung, kidney, blood and vasculature, suchas hypertension and renal failure.
Researchers at MCWcurate approximately 200 articles from 30 journals everymonth.
This is a small portion of the 1200 articles pub-lished on rat research every month.
The concepts embod-ied by this document collection are ill defined.
Severalconversations with the RGD curators resulted in no clearspecification of interests or search terms.Document Representaion# Descriptors Qualifiers Combined Full-text1 0.9575034 0.9999974 0.9920269 0.91839852 0.9568182 0.9999954 0.9919998 0.91967603 0.9575754 0.9999963 0.9926404 0.92166384 0.9597954 0.9999977 0.9926714 0.92194555 0.9594162 0.9999967 0.9923353 0.92123696 0.9574500 0.9999971 0.9920885 0.91926357 0.9570196 0.9999883 0.9921626 0.91692838 0.9561051 0.9999972 0.9920506 0.91684679 0.9567221 0.9999963 0.9923461 0.917611410 0.9591231 0.9999945 0.9921960 0.919766011 0.9557686 0.9999958 0.9922536 0.919687512 0.9552862 0.9999971 0.9922055 0.916524913 0.9567133 0.9999963 0.9918659 0.919034114 0.9557888 0.9999955 0.9917869 0.915764815 0.9583430 0.9999974 0.9926036 0.917708416 0.9590242 0.9999968 0.9929164 0.920005617 0.9568303 0.9999974 0.9920061 0.918759418 0.9554807 0.9999956 0.9922523 0.916083819 0.9566919 0.9999966 0.9923793 0.918745320 0.9592093 0.9999971 0.9925647 0.9240020Table 1: Agglomerative coefficients from 20 bootstrapsamples.A comparative study of full text (abstracts and titles),MeSH descriptors, MeSH qualifiers, and a combinedMeSH descriptors and qualifiers representation was per-formed.
The document collection consists of 2713 pa-pers.
The term collection T for the full-text representa-tion contained 17177 unique terms after stemming andstop word removal; and for the MeSH representations,T contained 5013 descriptors and 64 qualifiers.
AfterPCA, the number of principal components used for thedescriptors, qualifiers, combined, and full-text represen-tations are 16, 2, 62, and 37 respectively.The clustering quality of each representation was eval-uated using 20 bootstrap samples (i.e., sampling with re-placement) of size 2713 from the 2713 documents.
Eachsample was represented and clustered.
The resulting ag-glomerative coefficients were tabulated (Table 1).
Toshow a significant difference in the agglomerative coef-ficients obtained between MeSH representations and thefull-text representation, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, anon-parametric version of the paired t-test, was applied.The p-values in Table 2 indicate that each of the MeSHrepresentations are significantly different than the full-text representation.
By observing that larger agglomer-ative coefficients indicate higher quality clustering, weconclude that MeSH representations offer higher qualityclustering than the full-text representation.The full text and combined MeSH representations arefurther explored.
Dendrograms for the full text represen-tation (Figure 4) and combined representation (Figure 3)show the structure of the document collection.

Furthermore, the tree con-tains several small and tight clusters at a low height, indi-cating the existence of possible subconcepts.
In contrast,the resulting tree for the full text representation does notreveal the same structure, suggesting subconcepts are notclearly identified.Depicted in Figures 5 and 6 are two dimensional scat-terplots of the documents projected on the first two princi-pal components of the combined representation and full-text representation respectively.
These plots also showa structure with the descriptors and qualifiers represen-tation, there are two distinguished clusters with few out-liers.
The two clusters in the dendrogram of the combinedrepresentation correspond to the left and right groupsseen in the scatterplot.Table 3 presents summary description of the clustersfound for the combined representation.
Terms with aweight > 0.5 are included.
The summary describes thetwo major groups of papers: one related to sequence andmolecular techniques; the other related to metabolism,biochemical phenomena and physiology.5.2 Tourette?s SyndromeA second, exploratory study was performed on a docu-ment collection about the disease Tourette?s Syndrome.Only the results of using the combined representation arepresented here.Tourette?s syndrome is neurological disorder charac-0.00.20.40.60.81.0Figure 4: Dendrogram using full-text representation, av-erage linking, and cosine distance.

Chromosomes 2, 7, 11, and 18 have beenimplicated in causal effects of the disease (OMIM, 2003).The collection was obtained using the query?Tourette?s Syndrome?
on PubMed, resulting in2241 papers.
The term collection for the combinedrepresentation consists of 6524 MeSH descriptors and76 MeSH qualifiers.
Only 8 principal components wererequired to capture 25% of the variance in the data set.Figure 7 contains the resulting dendrogram.
Three dis-tinct clusters of documents exist at a height of 1.0.
Theleftmost cluster in the tree could be split again at a heightof approximately 0.9.
The clusters at lower heights arenot as tightly defined as those in the RGD study, indicat-ing more diversity in the document contents.Summaries of the three clusters are given in Table 4.In all three clusters, terms associated with Tourettes Syn-drome appear with a weight > 0.5 in the cluster center.Documents in the left cluster appear to focus on the psy-chology and diagnosis associated with the disease, dis-cussing all age groups and genders.
The middle clus-ter consists of papers associated with the genetics andphysiopathological diagnosis of Tourette?s Syndrome.
Ofparticular interest is the lack of age and gender terms,meaning the papers do not represent consistent themes inages or genders.
Papers associated with drug therapy andpharmacological studies comprise the right cluster, againspanning all age groups and genders.
It should be notedthat Tourette?s Syndrome patients show a therapeutic re-sponse to Haloperidol (OMIM, 2003).The three identified clusters are represented by 1, 2(in the bottom center of the plot), and 3 in Figure 8, ascatterplot projected onto the first two principal compo-nents.

The scatterplot sug-gests the existence of smaller clusters, which agrees withthe hierarchical clustering results.6 Related WorkSrinivasan has extensively investigated the use of MeSHfor classification and text mining (Srinivasan, 2001; Ruizand Srinivasan, 2002; Srinivasan and Rindflesch, 2002;Ruiz and Srinivasan, 2003; Srinivasan and Wedemeyer,2003; Srinivasan, to appear).
Of particular interest is thework on concept profiles to provide targeted summariesof document collections.
In comparison to our work, con-cept profiles provide a global insight into a document col-lection, whereas document clustering can provide insightinto important groups within a document collection.Document clustering of medical literature in full-textrepresentations has been used for functional annotationof gene products (Renner and Aszo?di, 2000) and conceptdiscovery (Iliopoulos et al, 2001).
In the latter paper, theauthors ignore MeSH, arguing that it is not updated ormay not capture the document contents.
In our study, wefound MeSH indexed documents without abstracts, sug-gesting that clustering with MeSH terms is complemen-tary work.
MeSH descriptors have been considered as ad-ditional features in document clustering (Wilbur, 2002),but the hierarchical relationships of MeSH are not used.Ontology-based clustering has been considered (Hothoet al, 2001).
In this work, terms are selected from theontology based on frequency, employing the parent-childrelationships.

The vertical axis rep-resents the intercluster distance, or height, at which theclusters are merged.esting.A distance measure using MeSH has been introducedas part of an algorithm to assign MeSH terms (Ontrup etal., 2003).
The distance measure considers a tree basedrepresentation; the tree induced by assigned MeSH terms.To overcome combinatorial issues, representative sub-trees are constructed.
Distance is measured via comple-ments and overlaps of representative subtrees.Transitive relationships between genes and diseasewith MeSH terms have also been explored (Hristovskiand Peterlin, 2002; Perez-Iratxeta et al, 2002), using as-sociation rules and fuzzy logic models, respectively.7 Conclusions and Future WorkThe presented results indicate that MeSH representationsare useful for document clustering.
MeSH representa-tions provide better quality AGNES clustering than fulltext representations using TF weighting.
Furthermore,clusters are easily summarized and the summaries can bereadily interpreted in the context of the document collec-tion.It is quite surprising that using principal componentscovering only 25% of the variance provides such obviousstructure.
Even the first two principal components elicitsstructure in the two document collections tested here.Many directions exist for improving MeSH represen-tation.
The representations may lose information em-bedded in the DAGs, since relationship between descrip-tors (or qualifiers) and their parents are not strictly main-tained.
Explicit associations between qualifiers and de-scriptors were removed to simplify representation; theseshould be reintroduced.

The x and y axesare the first two principal components.porated.The summarization approach is straightforward, butpresents terms that are not insightful.
For example, Ratsis frequently a term with high ranking, bus is not informa-tive in the RGD context.
Similar observations have beenpreviously made (Kankar et al, 2002).
Term weightingand more flexibility in summarization should help.MeSH representations have disadvantages comparedto full text.
The manual curation process requires severalweeks for indexing.
Yearly revision of MeSH impliessystems must adapt to changes.
Full text in abstracts andpapers contain more precise information.
We feel, how-ever, that combining ontology and full text representa-tions should be beneficial.8 AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Susan Bromberg and the RatGenome Database team for document information, dis-cussions of curation tasks, and visitation space.ReferencesMichael W.
