Using a textual representational level component in the context ofdiscourse or dialogue generationFranck Panaget*Centre National d'Etudes des T@l@communications (CNET)LAA/TSS/RCPRoute de Tr@gastel -- 22300 Lannion - Franceemail: panaget@lannion.cnet.fr / tel: +33 96.05.28.52 / fax: +33 96.05.35.30Abst ractA natural language generation system is typically con-stituted by two main components: a content planningcomponent (e.g., text planner or dialogue act planner)and a linguistic realization component.
But, this is notsufficient since, on the one hand, the message built by thecontent pldnning component is generally not adequatelydetailed in order to control the many possibilities for itsexpression and, on the other hand, the content plannercannot influence the way in which the message will beverbalized.Generation systems require a third component, calledthe micro-planning (or sentence planning or phrasing)component, which acts as an intermediary between thepragmatico-semantic level and the purely syntactic level.The micro-planner is responsible for transforming themessage into a textual structure.
For this transformationto be achieved, grammatical nd lexical resources mustbe selected.1 In t roduct ionTraditionally, the architecture of a generation system iseither pipelined (e.g., TEXT \[McKeown 85\]), interleaved(e.g., PAULINE \[Hovy 90\]) or integrate.d (e.g., KAMP\[Appelt 85\]).
Whatever the approach, the system is di-vided into two main components: a message planningcomponent and a linguistic realization component.
Theformer is responsible for the selection and organizationof the information to be conveyed; it builds a structureoften called message.
The latter involves the formula-tion of the message in grammatically correct sentences.In a context of discourse, the message planning compo-nent is a text planner and the message is a text  p lan*This work was realized at the lstituto per la Ricerca Scientificae Tecnolo#ica (IRST) in Trento (Italy).
(e.g., see \[Maier & Not 93\]).
In a context of dialogue, themessage planner is a 'fictitious' component consisting of adialogue act planner, which precedes the generation sys-tem, and a planner for surface linguistic acts, which is acomponent of the generation system.
The dialogue actplanner builds plans of dialogue acts.
A plan of dialogueacts is a tree-like structure in which non-leaf nodes are.macro-acts (e.g., "disjunction" or "sequence" of dialogueacts) and leaf nodes are dialogue acts (see \[Sadek 91\]).A dialogue act conveys information about its type (e.g.,"inform", "yn-question" or "confirm"), its propositionalcontent (i.e., a semantico-conceptual representation f theinformation to be communicated), and the interlocutors.The surface linguistic act planner transforms a plan ofdialogue acts into a p lan of  surface l inguist ic acts(i.e., the message).
In particular, the dialogue act typeis transformed into a surface linguistic act type such as"assertion", "answer" or "question", and the semantico-conceptual content into a semantic propositional content(cf.
figure 1 and section 3).One of the problems which appear in traditional gen-eration systems concerns the message itself: it is under-specified with respect o the language.
On the one hand,the message planner cannot influence the way in whichthe message will be verbalized, and, on the other hand,the message is not detailed enough for the many possibil-ities for its expression to be controlled.
Figure 1 showsseveral messages (a text plan and three surface linguisticacts corresponding to the same dialogue act) and theirdifferent verbalizations.A second problem is related to the fact that most gen-eration systems produce texts successfully since they im-plicitly ensure that the messages are expressible.
Forinstance, in the case where the message is a text plan,each atomic unit in the message must be a proposition,and thus can always be realized as a clause.
Each unitcan be independently translated into the language us-ing the linguistic realization component, since there are1277th International Generation Workshop ?

In particular,clauses can be connected with coordinate or subordinateconjunctions or can be simply realized as separate sen-tences.
However, this kind of approach does not use thefull expressive power of the language in which units maybe much more tightly composed.
Moreover, as arguedin \[Hovy 92\], a two-component generation system is notsatisfactory in producing 'good quality' texts since toomany phenomena re ignored or processed in a simplis-tic way, for example, anaphora planning, choice of lexicalitems, aggregation of clauses and noun phrases, selectionof grammatical constructions (e.g., the choice of the verbvoice), and segmentation i to sentences (i.e., single sen-tence vs. separate sentences, hypotaxis vs. parataxis,and determination of clause order).
The main difficultyin taking these phenomena into account is due to the factthat they are"supra-grammatical but not really related to con-tent selection and organization" \[Hovy 92, p. 2\].In fact, Hovy argues that these phenomena should betreated after the message planning and before the lin-guistic realization.A third problem is related to the fact that in a two-component generation system the conceptual decisionsare taken by the message planner and the the linguis-tic decisions by the realization component.
Since concep-tual and linguistic decisions are dependent on each other(see \[Danlos 87\]), the two components should be able tocommunicate with each other.
On the one hand, the defi-nition of such a communication is a complex task, due tothe gap between the two activities (see \[Meteer 92\]).
Onthe other hand, all the grammatical details that can beprovided by a linguistic realizer may not be useful to takethese decisions.
We think that, in a first step, it is use-128!7th International Generation Workshop * Kennebunkport, Maine * June 21-24, 1994sem-cat named-object unique-object --object instance-of-a-kind .

Forexample, it is useful to know that a present participialclause can verbalize the rhetorical relation "result", butit is not useful to know (in a first step) that a presentparticipial clause is formed by adding "ing" at the end ofthe stem of a verb.2 Micro-planning componentIn order to solve the above mentioned problems, a compo-nent can be added between the message planner and thelinguistic realizer (e.g., see \[Levelt 89\] or \[Hovy 92\]).
Therole of this third component, called the micro -p lannerin \[Levelt 89\], is to plan the best informational perspec-tive that can be given to the message.
The componentoften uses an intermediate r presentation level.
For ex-ample, in the system Epicure \[Dale 88\], a recoverable se-mantic structure, which specifies the underlying contentof the utterance to be generated, and an abstract syntac-tic structure, which is much closer to the surface syntaxof the linguistic form which will be produced, are used.Dale also shows how the two levels of representation playa role in the generation of elisions and one-anaphoric ex-pressions.
However, the abstract syntactic level of mostgeneration systems is often hazy and dependent on thesyntactic formalism used by the linguistic realization com-ponent.Our intermediate structure, which we call tex tua l  1s t ructure ,  is expressed in terms of abst ract  l inguis-t ic resources \[Meteer 92\] 2.
These resources are abstrac-tions over concrete resources of language (e.g., syntacticstructures, words, and grammatical features); they reflectlinguistic onstraints while abstracting away from syntac-tic details.
They are useful for generation systems inceallowing a generation system to select the con-crete resources.., makes available many moredegrees of freedom than the language actuallypermits \[Meteer 92, p. 67\].Abstract linguistic resources become the terms in whichthe micro-planning component takes its decisions andthat way they constrain the system to only do what is ex-pressible in the language since it is not allowed to choosethem independently.
We made some modifications ontwo kinds of abstract resources defined by Meteer: weimproved her semantic categories by using perspectivesfrom systemic functional linguistics (cf.
section 2.1) andwe extended the notion of resource trees (cf.
section 2.2).l"Textual" is used in the sense of the textual metafunc-tion in the systemic functional theory (see below).
For pre-sentations of systemic functional inguistics, see \[Halliday 85\] or\[Matthiessen & Bateman 91\].2Meteer used the abstract linguistic resources to build a struc-ture which she called text structure.
We do not use the same namebecause Meteer's tructure could exist at the same level of rhetor-ical structure theory (i.e., tile message planning level) whereas ourstructure is complementary to this level.1297th International Generation Workshop ?
Kennebunkport, Maine ?
June 21-24, 1994Moreover, we explicitly defined lezical resources (cf.
sec-tion 2.3).2 .1  Semant ic  h ie rarch iesSemantic ategories (cf.
figure 2) reflect pertinent combi-nations of linguistic features (e.g., syntactic features andlexical items).
For example, the five sub-categories ofob jec t  s are specified from definiteness (i.e., definite orindefinite) and number (i.e., singular or plural).
Thesecategories constrain the composition of the utterance bydefining what kinds of constituents can be extended andhow they can be composed.
For example, an adjunctconstituent of type manner  can be added to an event(e.g., Peter suddenly decided to go to the beach) whereasan adjunct of type proper ty  cannot (e.g., *Peter impor-tantly decided to go to the beach4); a process -event  canbe composed with a durat ive -adverb ia l  (e.g., Karenwatched TV for an hour) whereas a t rans i t ion -eventmay be composed of a f rame-adverb ia l  (e.g., Karensolved the problem in one hour).On the one hand, we think that according to sys-temic linguistic theory s, the hierarchy of semantic cat-egories mikes ideational constraints and textual con-straints; both are semantic, but semantic of rather dif-ferent kinds.
Thus, while it is correct hat the categoriesevent,  manner, and proper ty  are semantic (ideational)categories, taking an event perspective on something is atextual decision, e.g.,"The ship sank.
"is an ideational event,  and it is textually presented withinan EVENT-PERSPECTIVE.
"The sinking of the ship"is still an ideational event,  but it is now presented withinan OBJECT-PERSPECTIVE.
Even clearer are cases suchas definite and indefinite noun phrases.
Thus the dif-ferences between "a man" and "the man" can be char-acterized as follows.
They are both ideational of cate-gory PERSON.
The noun phrase '% man" presents a dis-course entity of that ideational semantic ategory whichis textually UNIDENTIFIABLE.
This is a category drawnfrom textual semantics.
Textual semantic lassificationsof discourse ntities change as a text develops.
The nounphrase "the man" is classified textually as IDENTIFI-ABLE.
The former is realized grammatically (largely on3The semantic categories are noted in typewriter text.4FoUowing the general convention i  linguistics, we use "*" tomark magrarrmaatical sentences.sin this theory, language is organized functionally according tothree metafunctions, concerned with the representation f experi-ence (ideational), symbolic interaction between interlocutors (in-terpersonal), and presentation f information as text in context(textual).the basis of the textual semantic lassification) as an in-definite noun phrase, the latter as a definite noun phrase.In this way, ideational semantics and textual semanticsare complementary to each other and both help constraingrammatical realization.On the other hand, we think that the textual part ofMeteer's hierarchy is too abstract to treat phenomenathat need syntactic information such as anaphora plan-ning and selection of grammatical constructions ( ee alsothe other examples of linguistic phenomena given in sec-tion 1); in particular, syntactic information such as gen-der or verb voice is missing.In order to solve these problems, we propose to re--place the hierarchy with two constituent hierarchies: anideational semantic hierarchy and a textual semantic hi-erarchy.
The former is based on the Upper Model de-fined in \[Bateman et al 90\].
The latter was developedby ourselves; we call it the hierarchy of textual semanticcategories.
These two hierarchies are not incompatiblesince\[a\] language.., embodies a multiplicity of con-stituent hierarchies, coexisting in different partsof the system.
They are not unrelated: on thecontrary, lhey are all different facets of the samephenomenon.
\[...\] At the same time, each ofthese hierarchies is independent of the others,and lhere are infinite possibilities of matchingthem up in a meaningful way \[Halliday 85, p.18\].The Upper  Mode l  provides a domain-independent,general and reusable conceptual organization which isused to classify the world knowledge when linguistic pro-cessing is to be performed.
This general semantic taxon-omy can also be seen as an inheritance hierarchy thatorganizes concepts according to how they can be ex-pressed (cf.
figure 3).
The Upper Model also'expresses(ideational) semantic restrictions on arguments requiredby entities it involves.
For example, the realization-event 6requires two participants: an agent that must be an an-imate and a patient hat must be a product.
The UpperModel also provides the type of qualities which may beascribed to particular concepts.
For example, the Up-per Model expresses that the destination relation relatesa place object to an event.The h ie rarchy  of  textua l  semant ic  categor iesis a property inheritance network that represents tex-tual knowledge of the target language.
Figure 4 showsa part of our hierarchy; the whole hierarchy containsabout eighty categories.
The definition of the textualsemantic categories is based on an analysis of French\[Bescherelle 90\] and of English \[nalliday 85, Shinghal 92\].6'rhe ideational semantic ategories are noted in italic text.1307th International Generation Workshop ?

Complex-clauses 7 are realizedas sentences.
The sub-hierarchy of clause represents dif-ferent linguistic forms of clause; in particular, the time-anchored-event is realized as a finite clause, the activityas a non finite clause and the object-perspective as clausenominalization.
The clause-nucleus sub-hierarchy classi-fies different kinds of verbs (e.g., transitive and intransi-tive verbs) and verb voice.
The other-argument is realizedas verb argument hat has no specific grammatical  func-tion, whereas the three other clause-nucleus-argumentsare realized as constituents whose grammatical  functionis subject, direct object or indirect object.
For exam-ple, the verb "to get to" requires two arguments: onesubject-argument (realized as the subject) and one other-argument which represents the destination.
The textual-object is realized as a noun phrase, and, in particular,the unidentifiable-object as an indefinite noun phrase andthe identifiable-object as a definite one.
The hierarchy oftextual-object-nucleus corresponds to nouns; it representsvarious linguistic forms of nouns with respect o their gen-der and number.
The modifiers are realized as adjectives,adverbs, prepositional phrases, and subordinate clauses.2 .2  Resource  t reesResource trees are primitive trees from which textualstructures are built.
In particular, they indicate the wayin which a constituent (i.e., a textual structure node) canbe expanded, that is, what are its sub--constituents, or ex-gended, that is, what kind of additional sub-constituentscan be added.
They are defined from elementary trees.Meteer distinguished two basic forms of elementary trees:the kernel tree and the composite tree.
These two treesrepresent Halliday's distinction between the multivariateand the univariate structure, respectively \[Halliday 85\].The kernel tree (i.e., the HEAD-ARGUMENT structure) isan atomic structure, that means, it cannot be modified in-dependently from the whole structure.
Essentially, it rep-resents a predicate/argument structure.
The compositetree is an incremental structure, that is, new child nodescan be added at any t ime of the expansion of the mothernode.
Meteer distinguished the COMPOSITE-MATRIX-ADJUNCT structure, which corresponds to the hypotac-tic relation (i.e., the relation between dependent ele-ments and their dominating node), and the COMPOSITE-COORDINATE structure, which represents the paratacticrelation (i.e., the relation between elements of equal sta-tus).
Meteer defined resource trees as follows:(define-composite-tree complex-event-tree(matrix &rest adjunct)7The textual semantic categories are noted in sans serif text.
:constructor-function build-complex-event-tree:matrix-restrictions (state event):adjunct-restrictions (manner location))This definition expresses that the complex-event  re-source tree is a COMPOSITE tree whose MATRIX hasto be of type s ta te  or event  and ADJUNCTs of typeraarmer or locat ion .
It also specifies a constructor func-tion which builds the tree.We think that the language for defining resource treesis not powerful enough.
For instance, it must be explic-itly specified that a composite tree only has one matrixnode or that an ac t iv?~y does not have an explicit sub-ject.
In order to solve this problem, a more powerful an-guage had to be defined.
In particular, the restriction ondaughter nodes is more precise.
In addition, we introducethe notions of relevance and constraints.
Restrictions areexpressed by using a specific language which expressesquantities (e.g., "one" or "several") and description ofthe daughter constituents.
In particular, each daughterconstituent is described by a structure, which we call ab-s t rac t  const i tuent ,  which specifies the ideational andtextual semantic ategories of the constituent, its struc-tural relationship with the mother node, and its rele-vance.
The re levance  is the link between textual struc-ture nodes and parts of the message; it indicates the partof the message verbalized by the mother node and its childnodes.
Const ra in ts  are conditions which must be satis-fied by the textual structure.
For example, constraintscan express that the subject-argument of an infinitive-activity will not explicitly appear in the final text.
Figure5 shows the definition of the "infinitive-activity" resourcetree s, which is a composite tree whose mother node hasthe textual category infinitive-activity.
The tree has oneand only one matrix node of the ideational category pro-cess and of the textual category clause-nucleus, and ad-ditional adjunct nodes of the ideational category circum-stance and of the textual category clause-modifier.
It spec-ifies a constraint which states that the subject-argumentmust be implicit.
It also indicates that the mother nodeand its daughter nodes correspond to the same part ofthe message, that is, they have the same relevance (cf.the variable X in figure 5) 9.2 .3  Lex ica l  resourcesLexical items, i.e., words, are lexical resources of the lan-guage.
We represent heir meaning by associating eachof them with entities of the Upper Model and of the tex-8Meteer's resource trees axe expressed in terms of semantic cat-egories whereas our resource trees axe defined in terms of textualcategories.9 The variable of the field "relevance" is unified with the relevanceof a textual structure's node during the expansion of the node withthe resource tree.1327th International Generation Workshop ?

For example, the lexical resourcewhich corresponds to the direct transitive verb "to write"is defined as follows:\ ["to-write" \](direct-transltive-nucleus)(write-action)A lexical resource can be linked to more than one textualcategory; for example, the following resources"article" \](slngular-neuter-nucleus pl ral-neuter-nucleus)(a icle)"quick" \](object-modifier clause-modifier)(quick)correspond to the nouns "article" and "articles" and tothe adjective "quick" and the adverb "quickly", respec-tively.
A lexical resource can also be associated withseveral ideational categories; for example, the followingresource\[ \] (clause-modifier)(purpose enablemen~}can be used to verbalize a rhetorical relation "purpose"or "enablement".2.4 Textua l  s t ruc tureThe textual structure is a tree-like structure built fromresource trees.
It represents the constituency of theutterance (each node is a complete constituent of theutterance), the structural relations among constituents(head-argument, composite-matrix-adjunct, composite-coordinate), the ideational and textual categories, the rel-evance and the restriction of each node, and the lexemes.In addition, a marker which describes the lexical cohe-sion of the text (see \[Halliday & Hasan 76\]) is associatedto each lexeme.
The textual structure provides linguisticinformation which is required for treating specific linguis-tic phenomena such as anaphora planning (see section 1).For example, in figure 6 (only the main information con-tained in each node is depicted), the textual structureindicates that the domain instance "Stock" correspondsto a male and will be verbalized as a singular masculineproper name (named-object + singular-masculine-name).Several textual structures can be built to verbalize onemessage.
The structure which is selected is the one whichhas the higher cohesive score.
This score is obtained bysumming the scores of lexical cohesion of all lexical re-sources used in the textual structure.
The score of eachresource is obtained as follows:?
if the lexical resource appears in the local context (efthistory of dialogue acts) then the lexical cohesion isscored 3;?
if the lexical resource appears in the active set of thehistory of linguistic resources then the score is 2;?
if the lexical resource appears in the open set of thehistory of linguistic resources then the score is 1;* otherwise, the score is 0.3 Utterance generation in thecontext of dialogueA plan of dialogue acts is verbalized by transforming itinto two successive representational levels: surface lin-guistic acts and textual representations.

Each item of this list provides informationon the dialogue act itself, the way in which conceptualentities that appear in its propositional content were re-alized with respect o the lexical semantics and the listof linguistic resources used.
This information constitutesa local context  during the verbalization of the answer.The h i s to ry  of  conceptua l  ent i t ies contains informa-tion on the conceptual entities (e.g., "arrival-airport") al-ready verbalized in the dialogue and the way in whichthey were realized with respect o lexical semantics.
Thishistory is used for the verbalization of all surface linguis-tic acts, except for "answers" (the semantic realizationof conceptual entities that appear in an "answer" is con-strained by the local context retrieved from the historyof dialogue acts).
The h i s to ry  of  objects  involves in-formation on the instances of conceptual entities (e.g.," JFK") mentioned in the dialogue.
It is used to retrieveobjects that are required from the lexical semantics pointof view during the surface linguistic act planning (cf.
theideational semantic restrictions on arguments of entitiesof the Upper Model).
It also provides information that isuseful during anaphora planning, such as the informationstatus (given or new) of objects.
Finally, the h is tory  ofl inguist ic-resources indicates which abstract linguisticresources have been used in the dialogue.
It is divided intotwo sets: an active set and an open set.
The act ive setcontains the linguistic resources used in the last sentenceof the dialogue, and the open  set the resources used inthe preceding sentences.
In particular, this history is usedto evaluate the cohesion of textual structures.We will take an example to show how the generationsystem deals with these histories in order to verbalize aplan of dialogue acts.
We will assume that the interlocu-tor (i.e., the user) uttered the following question duringthe dialogue:The 10:00 flight goes to which airport?The dialogue act planner builds a dialogue act of inform-ing that the airport is " JFK "1?
(this act is shown in fig-ure 1).
Since there is a request in the history of dia-logue acts that corresponds to the dialogue act, the sur-face linguistic act planner decides to build an "answer"surface linguistic act.
Then, it uses the local context pro-vided by this history in order to transform the semantico-conceptual content into a semantic ontent.
In particular,it builds a propositional content expressing a destination-event whose theme is "the 10:00 flight" and whose desti-nation is "JFK" ~cf.
content 1 in figure 1).
Finally, theconstructed linguistic act is passed to the micro-planningcomponent.
This component builds at least two textualstructures representing the cases where the des~ination-even~ is verbalized by "to go" or "to arrive".
Since "to go"1?The way in which dialogue acts and plans of dialogue acts arebuilt is explained in \[Sadek 91\].appears in the local context, the selected textual struc-ture is the one corresponding to the following utterance:The 10:00 .flight goes to JFK.According to the content of the history of objects, themicro-planner can introduce anaphoric expressions.
Inthat case, the built textual structure corresponds to:It goes to JFK.Finally, using the history of linguistic resources, the plan-ner can produce llipsis, in which case, the textual struc-ture built corresponds to:To JFK.4 Concluding remarksIn this paper we described a component of a natural an-guage generation, called the micro-planner, which is situ-ated between the message planner and the linguistic real-ization component.
Its role is to bridge the gap betweenthe two traditional components in order to avoid someof the problems which arise in two-component genera-tion systems.
In order to achieve this, the micro-plannertransforms the message built by the message planner intoan intermediate structure, which we call textual struc-ture.
This structure represents an abstract grammaticalorganization of the final text.
In particular, it providessemantic and syntactic information, which is useful tohandle linguistic phenomena such as anaphora planning.This new representational level is based on the notion ofabstract linguistic resources \[Meteer 92\].
We made twomain modifications.
Firstly, Meteer's semantic ategoryhierarchy was substituted by two distinct semantic hier-archies: an ideational semantic hierarchy (i.e., the UpperModel \[Bateman et al 90\]) and a textual semantic hier-archy.
Secondly, we increased the expressibility of theresource tree definition language.
Moreover, we defineda simple mechanism to represent lexical resources of thelanguage.In a three-component generation system, the micro-planner makes the linguistic decisions (e.g., the selectionof syntactic structures and the choice of lexical items)that are usually taken by the linguistic realizer in atwo-component generation system.
The advantages are,firstly, taking a decision is simpler since the micro-plannerde~ls with abstract linguistic knowledge, secondly, themicro-planner is closer to the message planner than thelinguistic realizer, and, thirdly~ the linguistic realizationcomponent is simplified since it no longer has to take lin-guistic decisions.
Such a component appears in the gen-eration system of \[Danlos 87\]: the strategic componenttakes conceptual and linguistic decisions, and the tacti-cal component only applies grammar ules.

June 21-24, 1994linguistic realization component only deals with syntacticdetails uch as agreement and complete surface order andmorphology.Our micro-planning component is currently being in-tegrated in a text generation system developed at IRST(see \[Maier & Not 93, Panaget 94\]).
A previous version(\[Panaget 92\]) was implemented in order to be integratedin a human-computer oral dialogue systefn developed atCNET \[Sadek et al 94\].
For the former case, the linguis-tic realization component \[Pianesi 91\] is based on the gov-ernment and binding theory and a head-driven bottom-up generation algorithm.
The component consists of anintegrated system for editing, modifying and maintain-ing unification-based grammars.
For the latter case, thelinguistic realizer is based on Tree Adjoining Grammar\[Joshi 87\].
In particular, the textual structure is trans-formed into a derivation tree (i.e., a tree which specifiesa derived tree through a bottom-up traversal), which isthen 'executed' by the linguistic component in order tobuild a derived tree (i.e., a syntactic tree).AcknowledgementsI am extremely grateful to John Bateman, ElisabethMaier, Elena Not, David Sadek and Oliviero Stock fortheir helpful comments on early versions of this paper.References\[Appelt 85\] Appelt D.E., Planning english sentences;Cambridge University Press, 1985.\[Bateman et al 90\] Bateman J.A., Kasper R.T., MooreJ .D .
