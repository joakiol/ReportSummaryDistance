Thetreebank is based on deep LFG (Lexical-Functional Grammar) grammars that weredeveloped within the framework of theParGram (Parallel Grammar) effort.
Thegrammars produce output that is maxi-mally parallelized across languages andlanguage families.
This output forms thebasis of a parallel treebank covering adiverse set of phenomena.
The treebankis publicly available via the INESS tree-banking environment, which also allowsfor the alignment of language pairs.
Wethus present a unique, multilayered paral-lel treebank that represents more and dif-ferent types of languages than are avail-able in other treebanks, that representsdeep linguistic knowledge and that allowsfor the alignment of sentences at sev-eral levels: dependency structures, con-stituency structures and POS information.1 IntroductionThis paper discusses the construction of a paralleltreebank currently involving ten languages thatrepresent several different language families, in-cluding non-Indo-European.
The treebank is basedon the output of individual deep LFG (Lexical-Functional Grammar) grammars that were deve-loped independently at different sites but withinthe overall framework of ParGram (the ParallelGrammar project) (Butt et al, 1999a; Butt et al,2002).
The aim of ParGram is to produce deep,wide coverage grammars for a variety of lan-guages.
Deep grammars provide detailed syntacticanalysis, encode grammatical functions as well as550other grammatical features such as tense or aspect,and are linguistically well-motivated.
The Par-Gram grammars are couched within the linguis-tic framework of LFG (Bresnan, 2001; Dalrymple,2001) and are constructed with a set of grammati-cal features that have been commonly agreed uponwithin the ParGram group.
ParGram grammars areimplemented using XLE, an efficient, industrial-strength grammar development platform that in-cludes a parser, a generator and a transfer sys-tem (Crouch et al, 2012).
XLE has been devel-oped in close collaboration with the ParGramproject.
Over the years, ParGram has continu-ously grown and includes grammars for Ara-bic, Chinese, English, French, German, Georgian,Hungarian, Indonesian, Irish, Japanese, Mala-gasy, Murrinh-Patha, Norwegian, Polish, Spanish,Tigrinya, Turkish, Urdu, Welsh and Wolof.ParGram grammars produce output that hasbeen parallelized maximally across languages ac-cording to a set of commonly agreed upon uni-versal proto-type analyses and feature values.
Thisoutput forms the basis of the ParGramBank paral-lel treebank discussed here.
ParGramBank is con-structed using an innovative alignment methodol-ogy developed in the XPAR project (Dyvik et al,2009) in which grammar parallelism is presup-posed to propagate alignment across different pro-jections (section 6).
This methodology has beenimplemented with a drag-and-drop interface aspart of the LFG Parsebanker in the INESS infras-tructure (Rose?n et al, 2012; Rose?n et al, 2009).ParGramBank has been constructed in INESS andis accessible in this infrastructure, which also of-fers powerful search and visualization.In recent years, parallel treebanking1 has gainedin importance within NLP.
An obvious applica-tion for parallel treebanking is machine transla-tion, where treebank size is a deciding factor forwhether a particular treebank can support a par-ticular kind of research project.
When conduct-ing in-depth linguistic studies of typological fea-tures, other factors such as the number of in-cluded languages, the number of covered phe-nomena, and the depth of linguistic analysis be-come more important.
The treebanking effort re-ported on in this paper supports work of the lat-ter focus, including efforts at multilingual depen-dency parsing (Naseem et al, 2012).
We have1Throughout this paper ?treebank?
refers to both phrase-structure resources and their natural extensions to depen-dency and other deep annotation banks.created a parallel treebank whose prototype in-cludes ten typologically diverse languages and re-flects a diverse set of phenomena.
We thus presenta unique, multilayered parallel treebank that rep-resents more languages than are currently avail-able in other treebanks, and different types of lan-guages as well.
It contains deep linguistic knowl-edge and allows for the parallel and simultane-ous alignment of sentences at several levels.
LFG?sf(unctional)-structure encodes dependency struc-tures as well as information that is equivalent toQuasi-Logical Forms (van Genabith and Crouch,1996).
LFG?s c(onstituent)-structure provides in-formation about constituency, hierarchical rela-tions and part-of-speech.
Currently, ParGramBankincludes structures for the following languages(with the ISO 639-3 code and language fam-ily): English (eng, Indo-European), Georgian (kat,Kartvelian), German (deu, Indo-European), Hun-garian (hun, Uralic), Indonesian (ind, Austrone-sian), Norwegian (Bokma?l) (nob, Indo-European),Polish (pol, Indo-European), Turkish (tur, Altaic),Urdu (urd, Indo-European) and Wolof (wol, Niger-Congo).

They bootstrap phrasal alignments overa sentence-aligned parallel corpus of English,French, German and Spanish and report concretetreebank annotation work on a sample of sen-tences from the Europarl corpus.

possible scheme in that itconsists solely of a bracketing for a sentence ina language (where only those units that play therole of a semantic argument or modifier in a largerunit are bracketed) and a correspondence relationof the constituents across languages.Klyueva and Marec?ek (2010) present a smallparallel treebank using data and tools from twoexisting treebanks.
They take a syntactically an-notated gold standard text for one language andrun an automated annotation on the parallel textfor the other language.
Manually annotated Rus-sian data are taken from the SynTagRus treebank(Nivre et al, 2008), while tools for parsing the cor-responding text in Czech are taken from the Tec-toMT framework (Popel and Z?abokrtsky?, 2010).The SMULTRON project is concerned with con-structing a parallel treebank of English, Germanand Swedish.
The sentences have been POS-taggedand annotated with phrase structure trees.
Thesetrees have been aligned on the sentence, phraseand word level.
Additionally, the German andSwedish monolingual treebanks contain lemma in-formation.
The treebank is distributed in TIGER-XML format (Volk et al, 2010).Megyesi et al (2010) discuss a parallel English-Swedish-Turkish treebank.
The sentences in eachlanguage are annotated morphologically and syn-tactically with automatic tools, aligned on thesentence and the word level and partially hand-corrected.3A further parallel treebanking effort is Par-TUT, a parallel treebank (Sanguinetti and Bosco,2011; Bosco et al, 2012) which provides depen-dency structures for Italian, English and Frenchand which can be converted to a CCG (Combina-tory Categorial Grammar) format.Closest to our work is the ParDeepBank, whichis engaged in the creation of a highly paral-lel treebank of English, Portuguese and Bulgar-ian.
ParDeepBank is couched within the linguisticframework of HPSG (Head-Driven Phrase Struc-ture Grammar) and uses parallel automatic HPSGgrammars, employing the same tools and imple-mentation strategies across languages (Flickingeret al, 2012).
The parallel treebank is aligned onthe sentence, phrase and word level.In sum, parallel treebanks have so far fo-cused exclusively on Indo-European languages3The paper mentions Hindi as the fourth language, butthis is not yet available: http://stp.lingfil.uu.se/?bea/turkiska/home-en.html.
(with Turkish providing the one exception) andgenerally do not extend beyond three or fourlanguages.
In contrast, our ParGramBank tree-bank currently includes ten typologically differ-ent languages from six different language families(Altaic, Austronesian, Indo-European, Kartvelian,Niger-Congo, Uralic).A further point of comparison with ParDeep-Bank is that it relies on dynamic treebanks, whichmeans that structures are subject to change dur-ing the further development of the resource gram-mars.
In ParDeepBank, additional machinery isneeded to ensure correct alignment on the phraseand word level (Flickinger et al, 2012, p. 105).ParGramBank contains finalized analyses, struc-tures and features that were designed collabora-tively over more than a decade, thus guaranteeinga high degree of stable parallelism.
However, withthe methodology developed within XPAR, align-ments can easily be recomputed from f-structurealignments in case of grammar or feature changes,so that we also have the flexible capability ofallowing ParGramBank to include dynamic tree-banks.3 ParGram and its Feature SpaceThe ParGram grammars use the LFG formalismwhich produces c(onstituent)-structures (trees)and f(unctional)-structures as the syntactic anal-ysis.
LFG assumes a version of Chomsky?s Uni-versal Grammar hypothesis, namely that all lan-guages are structured by similar underlying prin-ciples (Chomsky, 1988; Chomsky, 1995).
WithinLFG, f-structures encode a language universallevel of syntactic analysis, allowing for crosslin-guistic parallelism at this level of abstraction.
Incontrast, c-structures encode language particulardifferences in linear word order, surface morpho-logical vs. syntactic structures, and constituency(Dalrymple, 2001).
Thus, while the Chomskyanframework is derivational in nature, LFG departsfrom this view by embracing a strictly representa-tional approach to syntax.ParGram tests the LFG formalism for its uni-versality and coverage limitations to see how farparallelism can be maintained across languages.Where possible, analyses produced by the gram-mars for similar constructions in each language areparallel, with the computational advantage that thegrammars can be used in similar applications andthat machine translation can be simplified.552The ParGram project regulates the features andvalues used in its grammars.
Since its inceptionin 1996, ParGram has included a ?feature com-mittee?, which collaboratively determines normsfor the use and definition of a common multilin-gual feature and analysis space.
Adherence to fea-ture committee decisions is supported technicallyby a routine that checks the grammars for com-patibility with a feature declaration (King et al,2005); the feature space for each grammar is in-cluded in ParGramBank.
ParGram also conductsregular meetings to discuss constructions, analy-ses and features.For example, Figure 1 shows the c-structureof the Urdu sentence in (1) and the c-structureof its English translation.
Figure 2 shows the f-structures for the same sentences.
The left/upperc- and f-structures show the parse from the En-glish ParGram grammar, the right/lower ones fromUrdu ParGram grammar.4,5 The c-structures en-code linear word order and constituency and thuslook very different; e.g., the English structure israther hierarchical while the Urdu structure is flat(Urdu is a free word-order language with no evi-dence for a VP; Butt (1995)).
The f-structures, incontrast, are parallel aside from grammar-specificcharacteristics such as the absence of grammati-cal gender marking in English and the absence ofarticles in Urdu.6(1) ?

?With parallel analyses and parallel features, maxi-mal parallelism across typologically different lan-guages is maintained.
As a result, during the con-struction of the treebank, post-processing and con-version efforts are kept to a minimum.4The Urdu ParGram grammar makes use of a translitera-tion scheme that abstracts away from the Arabic-based script;the transliteration scheme is detailed in Malik et al (2010).5In the c-structures, dotted lines indicate distinct func-tional domains; e.g., in Figure 1, the NP the farmer and theVP sell his tractor belong to different f-structures: the formermaps onto the SUBJ f-structure, while the latter maps onto thetopmost f-structure (Dyvik et al, 2009).
Section 6 elaborateson functional domains.6The CASE feature also varies: since English does notdistinguish between accusative, dative, and other obliquecases, the OBJ is marked with a more general obl CASE.Figure 1: English and Urdu c-structuresWe emphasize the fact that ParGramBank ischaracterized by a maximally reliable, human-controlled and linguistically deep parallelismacross aligned sentences.
Generally, the result ofautomatic sentence alignment procedures are par-allel corpora where the corresponding sentencesnormally have the same purported meaning asintended by the translator, but they do not nec-essarily match in terms of structural expression.In building ParGramBank, conscious attention ispaid to maintaining semantic and constructionalparallelism as much as possible.
This design fea-ture renders our treebank reliable in cases whenthe constructional parallelism is reduced even at f-structure.
For example, typological variation in thepresence or absence of finite passive constructionsrepresents a case of potential mismatch.
Hungar-ian, one of the treebank languages, has no produc-tive finite passives.
The most common strategy intranslation is to use an active construction with atopicalized object, with no overt subject and with3PL verb agreement:(2) A fa?-t ki-va?g-t-a?k.the tree-ACC out-cut-PAST-3PL?The tree was cut down.
?In this case, a topicalized object in Hungarian hasto be aligned with a (topical) subject in English.Given that both the sentence level and the phraselevel alignments are human-controlled in the tree-bank (see sections 4 and 6), the greatest possibleparallelism is reliably captured even in such casesof relative grammatical divergence.553Figure 2: Parallel English and Urdu f-structures4 Treebank Design and ConstructionFor the initial seeding of the treebank, we focusedon 50 sentences which were constructed manu-ally to cover a diverse range of phenomena (tran-sitivity, voice alternations, interrogatives, embed-ded clauses, copula constructions, control/raisingverbs, etc.).
We followed Lehmann et al (1996)and Bender et al (2011) in using coverage ofgrammatical constructions as a key component forgrammar development.

Currently, theselanguages are: English, Georgian, German, Hun-garian, Indonesian, Norwegian (Bokma?l), Polish,Turkish, Urdu and Wolof.
The translations weredone by ParGram grammar developers (i.e., expertlinguists and native speakers).The sentences were automatically parsed withParGram grammars using XLE.
Since the pars-ing was performed sentence by sentence, our re-sulting treebank is automatically aligned at thesentence level.
The resulting c- and f-structureswere banked in a database using the LFG Parse-banker (Rose?n et al, 2009).
The structures weredisambiguated either prior to banking using XLEor during banking with the LFG Parsebanker andits discriminant-based disambiguation technique.The banked analyses can be exported and down-loaded in a Prolog format using the LFG Parse-banker interface.
Within XLE, we automaticallyconvert the structures to a simple XML format andmake these available via ParGramBank as well.The Prolog format is used with applicationswhich use XLE to manipulate the structures, e.g.for further semantic processing (Crouch and King,2006) or for sentence condensation (Crouch et al,2004).5545 Challenges for ParallelismWe detail some challenges in maintaining paral-lelism across typologically distinct languages.5.1 Complex PredicatesSome languages in ParGramBank make extensiveuse of complex predicates.
For example, Urdu usesa combination of predicates to express conceptsthat in languages like English are expressed witha single verb, e.g., ?memory do?
= ?remember?,?fear come?
= ?fear?.
In addition, verb+verb com-binations are used to express permissive or as-pectual relations.
The strategy within ParGram isto abstract away from the particular surface mor-phosyntactic expression and aim at parallelismat the level of f-structure.
That is, monoclausalpredications are analyzed via a simple f-structurewhether they consist of periphrastically formedcomplex predicates (Urdu, Figure 3), a simpleverb (English, Figure 4), or a morphologically de-rived form (Turkish, Figure 5).In Urdu and in Turkish, the top-level PREDis complex, indicating a composed predicate.
InUrdu, this reflects the noun-verb complex predi-cate sTArT kar ?start do?, in Turkish it reflects amorphological causative.
Despite this morphosyn-tactic complexity, the overall dependency struc-ture corresponds to that of the English simple verb.

?The f-structure analysis of complex predicatesis thus similar to that of languages which do notuse complex predicates, resulting in a strong syn-tactic parallelism at this level, even across typo-logically diverse languages.5.2 NegationNegation also has varying morphosyntactic sur-face realizations.
The languages in ParGramBankdiffer with respect to their negation strategies.Languages such as English and German use inde-pendent negation: they negate using words such asFigure 3: Complex predicate: Urdu analysis of (4)Figure 4: Simple predicate: English analysis of (4)adverbs (English not, German nicht) or verbs (En-glish do-support).
Other languages employ non-independent, morphological negation techniques;Turkish, for instance, uses an affix on the verb, asin (6).555Figure 5: Causative: Turkish analysis of (5)(6) du?g?me-ye bas-mabutton-Dat push-Neg.Imp?Don?t push the button.
?Within ParGram we have not abstracted awayfrom this surface difference.
The English not in(6) functions as an adverbial adjunct that modifiesthe main verb (see top part of Figure 6) and infor-mation would be lost if this were not representedat f-structure.
However, the same cannot be said ofthe negative affix in Turkish ?
the morphologicalaffix is not an adverbial adjunct.
We have there-fore currently analyzed morphological negation asadding a feature to the f-structure which marks theclause as negative, see bottom half of Figure 6.5.3 Copula ConstructionsAnother challenge to parallelism comes from co-pula constructions.
An approach advocating a uni-form treatment of copulas crosslinguistically wasadvocated in the early years of ParGram (Butt etal., 1999b), but this analysis could not do justice tothe typological variation found with copulas.
Par-GramBank reflects the typological difference withthree different analyses, with each language mak-ing a language-specific choice among the threepossibilities that have been identified (Dalrympleet al, 2004; Nordlinger and Sadler, 2007; Attia,2008; Sulger, 2011; Laczko?, 2012).The possible analyses are demonstrated herewith respect to the sentence The tractor is red.The English grammar (Figure 7) uses a raising ap-proach that reflects the earliest treatments of cop-ulas in LFG (Bresnan, 1982).
The copula takesa non-finite complement whose subject is raisedto the matrix clause as a non-thematic subject ofthe copula.
In contrast, in Urdu (Figure 8), theFigure 6: Different f-structural analyses for nega-tion (English vs. Turkish)copula is a two-place predicate, assigning SUBJand PREDLINK functions.
The PREDLINK functionis interpreted as predicating something about thesubject.
Finally, in languages like Indonesian (Fig-ure 9), there is no overt copula and the adjective isthe main predicational element of the clause.Figure 7: English copula example556Figure 8: Urdu copula exampleFigure 9: Indonesian copula example5.4 SummaryThis section discussed some challenges for main-taining parallel analyses across typologically di-verse languages.
Another challenge we face iswhen no corresponding construction exists in alanguage, e.g.
with impersonals as in the EnglishIt is raining.
In this case, we provide a translationand an analysis of the structure of the correspond-ing translation, but note that the phenomenon be-ing exemplified does not actually exist in the lan-guage.
A further extension to the capabilities ofthe treebank could be the addition of pointers fromthe alternative structure used in the translation tothe parallel aligned set of sentences that corre-spond to this alternative structure.6 Linguistically Motivated AlignmentThe treebank is automatically aligned on the sen-tence level, the top level of alignment within Par-GramBank.
For phrase-level alignments, we usethe drag-and-drop alignment tool in the LFG Parse-banker (Dyvik et al, 2009).
The tool allows thealignment of f-structures by dragging the indexof a subsidiary source f-structure onto the indexof the corresponding target f-structure.
Two f-structures correspond if they have translationallymatching predicates, and the arguments of eachpredicate correspond to an argument or adjunct inthe other f-structure.
The tool automatically com-putes the alignment of c-structure nodes on thebasis of the manually aligned corresponding f-structures.77Currently we have not measured inter-annotator agree-ment (IAA) for the f-structure alignments.
The f-structurealignments were done by only one person per language pair.We anticipate that multiple annotators will be needed for thisThis method is possible because the c-structureto f-structure correspondence (the ?
relation) isencoded in the ParGramBank structures, allow-ing the LFG Parsebanker tool to compute which c-structure nodes contributed to a given f-structurevia the inverse (?
?1) mapping.
A set of nodesmapping to the same f-structure is called a ?func-tional domain?.
Within a source and a targetfunctional domain, two nodes are automaticallyaligned only if they dominate corresponding wordforms.
In Figure 10 the nodes in each func-tional domain in the trees are connected by wholelines while dotted lines connect different func-tional domains.
Within a functional domain, thickwhole lines connect the nodes that share align-ment; for simplicity the alignment is only indi-cated for the top nodes.
The automatically com-puted c-structural alignments are shown by thecurved lines.
The alignment information is storedas an additional layer and can be used to ex-plore alignments at the string (word), phrase (c-)structure, and functional (f-)structure levels.We have so far aligned the treebank pairsEnglish-Urdu, English-German, English-Polishand Norwegian-Georgian.
As Figure 10 illustratesfor (7) in an English-Urdu pairing, the English ob-ject neighbor is aligned with the Urdu indirect ob-ject (OBJ-GO) hamsAyA ?neighbor?, while the En-glish indirect object (OBJ-TH) tractor is alignedwith the Urdu object TrEkTar ?tractor?.
The c-structure correspondences were computed auto-matically from the f-structure alignments.

The analyses in ParGram-Bank are the output of computational LFG Par-Gram grammars.
As a result of ParGram?s cen-trally agreed upon feature sets and prototypicalanalyses, the representations are not only deepin nature, but maximally parallel.
The representa-tions offer information about dependency relationsas well as word order, constituency and part-of-speech.In future ParGramBank releases, we will pro-vide more theory-neutral dependencies along withthe LFG representations.
This will take the form oftriples (King et al, 2003).
We also plan to providea POS-tagged and a named entity marked up ver-sion of the sentences; these will be of use for moregeneral NLP applications and for systems whichuse such markup as input to deeper processing.8One reviewer inquires about possibilities of linking(semi-)automatically between languages, for example usinglexical resources such as WordNets or Panlex.
We agree thatthis would be desirable, but unrealizable, since many of thelanguages included in ParGramBank do not have a WordNetresource and are not likely to achieve an adequate one soon.Third, the treebank will be expanded to include100 more sentences within the next year.
We alsoplan to include more languages as other ParGramgroups contribute structures to ParGramBank.ParGramBank, including its multilingual sen-tences and all annotations, is made freely avail-able for research and commercial use under theCC-BY 3.0 license via the INESS platform, whichsupports alignment methodology developed in theXPAR project and provides search and visualiza-tion methods for parallel treebanks.
We encouragethe computational linguistics community to con-tribute further layers of annotation, including se-mantic (Crouch and King, 2006), abstract knowl-edge representational (Bobrow et al, 2007), Prop-Bank (Palmer et al, 2005), or TimeBank (Maniand Pustejovsky, 2004) annotations.ReferencesMohammed Attia.
