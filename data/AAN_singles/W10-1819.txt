Theclinical PropBank is created on top of apreviously existing dependency treebankannotated in the Stanford Dependency(SD) scheme and covers 90% of all verboccurrences in the treebank.We establish that the PropBank schemeis applicable to clinical Finnish as wellas compatible with the SD scheme, withan overwhelming proportion of argumentsbeing governed by the verb.
This allowsargument candidates to be restricted to di-rect verb dependents, substantially simpli-fying the PropBank construction.The clinical Finnish PropBankis freely available at the addresshttp://bionlp.utu.fi.1 IntroductionNatural language processing (NLP) in the clini-cal domain has received substantial interest, withapplications in decision support, patient man-aging and profiling, mining trends, and others(see the extensive review by Friedman and John-son (2006)).
While some of these applications,such as document retrieval and trend mining,can rely solely on word-frequency-based methods,others, such as information extraction and summa-rization require a detailed linguistic analysis cap-turing some of the sentence semantics.
Among themost important steps in this direction is an analysisof verbs and their argument structures.In this work, we focus on the Finnish lan-guage in the clinical domain, analyzing its verbsand their argument structures using the PropBankscheme (Palmer et al, 2005).
The choice of thisparticular scheme is motivated by its practical,application-oriented nature.
We build the clinicalFinnish PropBank on top of the existing depen-dency treebank of Haverinen et al (2009).The primary outcome of this study is thePropBank of clinical Finnish itself, consisting ofthe analyses for 157 verbs with 2,382 occurrencesand 4,763 arguments, and covering 90% of allverb occurrences in the underlying treebank.
ThisPropBank, together with the treebank, is an impor-tant resource for the further development of clini-cal NLP applications for the Finnish language.We also establish the applicability of thePropBank scheme to the clinical sublanguage withits many atypical characteristics, and finally, wefind that the PropBank scheme is compatible withthe Stanford Dependency scheme of de Marneffeand Manning (2008a; 2008b) in which the under-lying treebank is annotated.2 The PropBank schemeOur annotation work is based on the PropBank se-mantic annotation scheme of Palmer et al (2005).For each verb, PropBank defines a number offramesets, each frameset corresponding to acoarse-grained sense.
A frameset consists of aroleset which defines a set of roles (argumentsnumbered from Arg0 onwards) and their descrip-tions, and a set of syntactic frames.
Any elementthat occurs together with a given verb sufficientlyfrequently is taken to be its argument.
Arg0 is gen-erally a prototypical Agent argument and Arg1 isa prototypical Patient or Theme argument.
Theremaining numbered arguments have no consis-tent overall meanings: they are defined on a verb-by-verb basis.
An illustration of a verb with twoframesets is given in Figure 1.
In addition to thenumbered arguments, a verb occurrence can havea number of modifiers, labeled ArgM, each modi-fier being categorized as one of 14 subtypes, suchas temporal, cause and location.137kesta?a?.0: ?tolerate?
kesta?a?.1: ?last?Arg0: the one who tolerates Arg1: the thing that lastsArg1: what is being tolerated Arg2: how long it lastsFigure 1: The PropBank framesets for kesta?a?

The text of the treebank compriseseight complete patient reports from an intensivecare unit in a Finnish hospital.
An intensive carepatient report describes the condition of the pa-tient and its development in time.
The clinicalFinnish in these reports has many characteristicstypical of clinical languages, including frequentmisspellings, abbreviations, domain terms, tele-graphic style and non-standard syntactic structures(see Figure 2 for an illustration).
For a detailedanalysis, we refer the reader to the studies by Laip-pala et al (2009) and Haverinen et al (2009).The treebank of Haverinen et al is annotatedin the Stanford Dependency (SD) scheme of deMarneffe and Manning (2008a; 2008b).
Thisscheme is layered, and the annotation variant ofthe treebank of Haverinen et.
al is the basic vari-ant of the scheme, in which the analysis forms atree.The SD scheme also defines a collapsed de-pendencies with propagation of conjunct depen-dencies variant (referred to as the extended vari-ant of the SD scheme throughout this paper).
Itadds on top of the basic variant a second layerof dependencies which are not part of the strict,syntactic tree.
In particular, the xsubj dependencymarks external subjects, and dependencies involv-ing the heads of coordinations are explicitly dupli-PatientPotilas allowedsaanut to_haveottaa juicemehua andja breadleip??

The dasheddependencies denote the external subjects andpropagated conjunct dependencies that are onlypart of the extended variant of the scheme.

The verbjuonut (drank) is marked with its frameset, in thiscase the frameset number 0.
This frameset spec-ifies that Arg0 marks the agent doing the drink-ing and Arg1 the liquid being consumed.
TheArgM-tmp label specifies that Aamulla is a tem-poral modifier.
The example can be translated asIn the morning patient drank a little juice.cated also for the remaining coordinated elementswhere appropriate.
The extended variant of the SDscheme is illustrated in Figure 3.Due to the importance of the additional depen-dencies for PropBanking (see Section 5 for discus-sion), we augment the annotation of the underly-ing treebank to conform to the extended variant ofthe SD scheme by manual annotation, adding a to-tal of 520 dependencies.The PropBank was originally developed on topof the constituency scheme of the Penn Tree-bank and requires arguments to correspond to con-stituents.
In a dependency scheme, where there isno explicit notion of constituents, we associate ar-guments of a verb with dependencies governed byit.
The argument can then be understood as theentire subtree headed by the dependent.
The an-notation is illustrated in Figure 4.4 PropBanking clinical FinnishWhen annotating the clinical Finnish PropBank,we consider all verbs with at least three occur-rences in the underlying treebank.
In total, weanalyze 157 verbs with 192 framesets.

The dashed dependencies labeled with the tech-nical dependency type xarg signify arguments and modifiers not in a syntactic relationship to the verb.These arguments and modifiers, as well as those associated with a conj or sdep dependency (ArgM-csqin this Figure), are only marked in the 100 sentence sample for quantifying unannotated arguments andmodifiers.
The sentence can be translated as Furesis did not help, stopped for now.mation, we identify all verbs and verbal participlesusing the FinCG1 analyzer, which gives a verbalreading to 2,816 tokens.
With POS tagging er-rors taken into account, we estimate the treebankto contain 2,655 occurrences of verbs and verbparticiples.
Of these, 2,382 (90%) correspond toverbs with at least three occurrences and are thusannotated.
In total, these verbs have 4,763 argu-ments and modifiers.Due to the telegraphic nature of clinical Finnish,omissions of different sentence elements, evenmain verbs, are very frequent.
In order to be ableto analyze the syntax of sentences with a missingmain verb, Haverinen et al have added a so callednull verb to these sentences in the treebank.
Forinstance, the clinical Finnish sentence Putkestanestetta?
(Liquid from the drain) lacks a main verb,and the insertion of one produces Putkesta *null*nestetta?.
In total, there are 428 null verb occur-rences, making the null verb the most commonverb in the treebank.In the clinical PropBank annotation, we treat thenull verb in principle as if it was a regular verb,and give it framesets accordingly.
For each nullverb occurrence, we have determined which reg-ular verb frameset it stands for, and found that,somewhat surprisingly, there were only four com-mon coarse senses of the null verb, roughly cor-responding to four framesets of the verbs olla (tobe), tulla (to come), tehda?
(to do) and laittaa (toput).
The 26 (6%) null verb occurrences that didnot correspond to any of these four framesets wereassigned to a ?leftover frameset?, for which no ar-guments were marked.1http://www.lingsoft.fi5 Annotating the arguments on top ofthe SD schemeIn contrast to the original PropBank, where anysyntactic constituent could be marked as an argu-ment, we require arguments to be directly depen-dent on the verb in the SD scheme (for an illustra-tion, see Figure 5).
This restriction is to consider-ably simplify the annotation process ?
instead ofall possible subtrees, the annotator only needs tolook for direct dependents of the verb.
In addition,this constraint should naturally also simplify pos-sible automatic identification and classification ofthe arguments.In addition to restricting arguments to direct de-pendents of the verb, coordination dependenciesconj and sdep (implicit coordination of top levelindependent clauses, see Figure 5) are left outsidethe annotation scope.
This is due to the nature ofthe clinical language, which places on these de-pendencies cause-consequence relationships thatrequire strong inference.
For instance, sentencessuch as Patient restless, given tranquilizers wherethere is clearly a causal relationship but no explicitmarker such as thus or because, are common.Naturally, it is necessary to estimate the effectof these restrictions, which can be justified onlyif the number of lost arguments is minimal.
Wehave conducted a small-scale experiment on 100randomly selected sentences with at least one verbthat has a frameset assigned.
We have providedthis portion of the clinical PropBank with a full an-notation, including the arguments not governed bythe verb and those associated with conj and sdepdependencies.
For an illustration, see Figure 5.There are in total 326 arguments and modifiers(169 arguments and 157 modifiers) in the 100 sen-tence sample.
Of these, 278 (85%) are governedby the verb in the basic SD scheme and are thus ina direct syntactic relationship with the verb.
Fur-139ther 19 (6%) arguments and modifiers are gov-erned by the verb in the extended SD scheme.
Outof the remaining 29 (9%), 23 are in fact modi-fiers, leaving only 6 numbered arguments not ac-counted for in the extended SD scheme.
Thus,96% (163/169) of arguments and 85% (134/157)of modifiers are directly governed by the verb.Of the 23 ungoverned modifiers, all are eithercause (CAU) or consequence (CSQ)2.
Of the sdepand conj dependencies only a small portion (9/68)were associated with an argument or a modifier,all of which were in fact CAU or CSQ modifiers.Both these and the CAU and CSQ modifiers notgoverned by the verb reflect strongly inferred rela-tionships between clauses.Based on these figures, we conclude that anoverwhelming majority of arguments and modi-fiers is governed by the verb in the extended SDscheme and restricting the annotation to depen-dents of the verb as well as leaving sdep and conjoutside the annotation scope seems justified.
Ad-ditionally, we demonstrate the utility of the con-junct dependency propagation and external subjectmarking in the extended SD scheme.6 Related workMany efforts have been made to capture meaningsand arguments of verbs.
For instance, the VerbNetproject (Kipper et al, 2000) strives to create abroad on-line verb lexicon, and FrameNet (Rup-penhofer et al, 2005) aims to document the rangeof valences of each verb in each of its senses.
ThePropBank project (Palmer et al, 2005) strives fora practical approach to semantic representation,adding a layer of semantic role labels to the PennTreebank (Marcus et al, 1993).In addition to the original PropBank by Palmeret al, numerous PropBanks have been devel-oped for languages other than English (e.g.
Chi-nese (Xue and Palmer, 2003) and Arabic (Diabet al, 2008)).
Also applications attempting toautomatically recover PropBank-style argumentshave been proposed.
For example, the CoNLLshared task has focused on semantic role labelingfour times, twice as a separate task (Carreras andMa`rquez, 2004; Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2005), andtwice in conjunction with syntactic parsing (Sur-deanu et al, 2008; Hajic?
et al, 2009).2CSQ is a new modifier subtype added by us, due tothe restriction of only annotating direct syntactic dependents,which does not allow the annotation of all causal relation-ships with the type CAU.In semantic analysis of clinical language, Paeket al (2006) have experimented on PropBank-based machine learning on abstracts of Random-ized Controlled Trials (RCTs), and Savova etal.
(2009) have presented work on temporal rela-tion discovery from clinical narratives.7 ConclusionIn this paper, we have presented a PropBank ofclinical Finnish, building a new layer of annotationon top of the existing clinical treebank of Haver-inen et al (2009).
This PropBank covers all 157verbs occurring at least three times in the treebankand accounts for 90% of all verb occurrences.This work has also served as a test case for thePropBank annotation scheme in two senses.
First,the scheme has been tested on a highly specializedlanguage, clinical Finnish, and second, its compa-tibility with the SD syntactic scheme has been ex-amined.
On both accounts, we find the PropBankscheme a suitable choice.In general, the specialized language did notseem to cause problems for the scheme.
For in-stance, the frequent null verbs could be analyzedsimilarly to regular verbs, with full 94% belongingto one of only four framesets.
This is likely due tothe very restricted clinical domain of the corpus.We also find a strong correspondence betweenthe PropBank arguments and the verb dependentsin the extended SD scheme, with 96% of argu-ments and 85% of modifiers being directly gov-erned by the verb.
The 15% ungoverned modifiersare cause-consequence relationships that requirestrong inference.
This correspondence allowed usto simplify the annotation task by only consideringdirect verb dependents as argument candidates.The new version of the treebank, manuallyanonymized, including the enhanced SD schemeannotation and the PropBank annotation, is freelyavailable at http://bionlp.utu.fi.AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to Helja?
