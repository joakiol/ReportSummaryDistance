INTERPRETING TEMPORAL ADVERBIALS*Chung Hee Hwang & Lenhart K. SchubertDepartment ofComputer Science, University of RochesterRochester, New York 14627-0226AbstractWe take for granted that sentences describe situations \[2, 12\].
Oneof the most important properties of situations are then their tempo-ral locations, which are indicated by tense and aspect and temporaladverbials in the surface form.
In \[10, 22\], we offered a formal the-ory for English tense and aspect and an algorithm that computes thetemporal relationships between the situations implicitly introducedby a text.
In the present paper, we propose asystematic approach totemporal adverbials, fully integrated with our tense-aspect theory andthe inte~retive algorithms, using the Episodic Logic (EL) formalism\[9, 11, 12, 211.1.
INTRODUCTIONPrevious theoretical work on temporal adverbials has mostlyconcentrated onadverbials specifying temporal locations (e.g.,"yesterday"), durations (e.g., "for a month") and time spans(e.g., "in three hours").
It appears that interest in the first kindof adverbial originated from the desire to correct he erroneousanalyses provided by Priorean tense logics, in particular, theirtreatment of the interaction between time adverbials and tense.The second and third kinds of adverbials were often consid-ered in connection with the aspectual c asses of the vPs or sen-tences those adverbials modify (e.g., durative adverbials maymodify only stative sentences, whereas adverbials of time spanmay modify only accomplishment sentences).
However, otherkinds of temporal adverbials have received little attention, in-cluding ones specifying repetition:The engineer shut down the motor twice yesterday.The engine frequently broke down.The operator checked the level of oil every half hour.The inspector visits the lab every Monday.On our analysis, these sentences describe complex events,consisting of a sequence of subevents of specified types, andthe given adverbials modify the structure of these complexevents: the cardinality of component events ("twice"), thefrequency or distribution pattern of component events ("fre-quently," "regularly," "every half hour," etc.
), and the temporallocation of cyclic events that occur synchronously with otherrecurrent time frames or events ("every Monday" or "everytime the alarm went off'').Other issues that deserve further investigation are the interac-tions between multiple temporal adverbials, and various kindsof aspectual class shift due to aspectual class constraints onthe use of adverbials (occurring singly or jointly with others).The following sentences illustrate these issues.

The authors benefited from example sentences byGreg Carlson and Phil Harrison.John ran for half an hour every morning for a month.John stepped out of his office for fifteen minutes.Mary is going to Boston for three days.Mary won the competition for four years.John saw Mary twice in two years.Our aim is to provide a uniform analysis for all kinds of tem-poral adverbials.
Our approach is compositional in that thelexicon supplies meanings at the word level (or possibly at themorpheme l vel, e.g., for '- ly' adverbs), and the meanings ofadverbials are computed from the lexical entries by our GPSG-like grammar rules.
The grammar rules take care of aspectualcompatibility of adverbials with the VPs they modify.
The re-suiting indexical logical form is then "deindexed" (convertedto an explicit, context-independent form) by a set of recursiverules.
The resultant episodic logical form (ELF) is formally in-terpretable and lends itself to effective inference.
We now con-sider the syntax and the semantics of temporal adverbials.
Wefirst show logical form representations of temporal adverbials,in both indexical and deindexed form, and how to obtain themfrom the surface structure, together with a brief discussion ofsemantics.
Then, we discuss an extension of our system thataccommodates aspectual class shifts to properly handle the in-teraction between temporal adverbials and aspectual classes.2.
SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS OFTEMPORAL ADVERBIALSWe first discuss the basic interpretive mechanism, using yes-terday as an example, and then generalize to other types oftemporal adverbials.2.1.
The Basic MechanismAs indicated in the following fragment of a GPSG-like sentencegrammar, we treat all adverbial adjuncts as VP-adjuncts at thelevel of syntax.
1 (Aspectual feature agreement is assumed, butnot discussed till section 3.
)NP ~- Mary ; MaryV\[lbar, past\] ~ left ; <past leave>VP ~ V\[lbar\] ; V'VP ~ VP ADVL\[post-VP\] ; (ADVL" VP')S ~---NPVP; \[NP" VP'\]However, despite this surface syntax, the semantic rule(ADVL' VV), specifying functional application of the ADVL-translation to the VP-translation, may lead to either predicatemodification or sentence modification at the level of immedi-ate logical form.
In particular, manner adverbials (e.g., withlIn sentences like "Yesterday Mary left," we treat the proposed ADVL astopicalized, i.e., as "extracted" from post-VP position.
However, we may wantto treat modal and attitude adverbials (as in "Oddly, Mary left") as sentence-modifying.
This does not affect our discussion here.138a brush, hastily, etc.)
are uniformly interpreted as predicatemodifiers at the level of immediate LF, while temporal (andlocative) adverbials are all interpreted as sentence modifiers.How such sentence-modifier interpretations are formed fromVP adjuncts is easily seen from rules such as the following:NP\[def-time\] ~ yesterday ; YesterdayPP\[post-VP\] (-- NP\[def-time\] ; (during NP')ADVL (-- PP\[e-mod, post-Ve\] ; APZx((adv-e PP3 \[x P\]).
(adv-e stands for 'episode-modifying adverbial'.
2 More onthis later.)
From these rules it is clear that the logical transla-tion of yesterday, as an adverbial adjunct, isZPZx((adv-e (during Yesterday)) Ix P\]).In the interpretation f a sentence such as "Mary left yester-day," this A-abstract would be applied to predicate leave (ini-tially paired with unscoped tense operator past), yieldinglx((adv-e (during Yesterday)) \[x <past leave>\]),and this in turn would be applied to term Mary (translating theNP Mary), yielding the formula((adv-e (during Yesterday)) \[Mary <past leave>\]).Here, (during Yesterday) is a 1-place predicate (the result ofapplying the 2-place predicate during to the indexical con-stant Yesterday, allowable in the"curried function" semanticsof EL).
adv-e maps this 1-place preedicate into a sentence mod-ifier; i.e., (adv-e (during Yesterday)) denotes a function fromsentence meanings to sentence meanings.
In the present case,the operand is the sentence \[Mary <past leave>\], written in thesquare-bracketed, infixed form that is the preferred sentencesyntax in EL.
3The above indexical (context-dependent) logical form is ob-tained quite directly as a byproduct of parsing, and is subse-quently further processed-- first, by scoping of ambiguouslyscoped quantifiers, logical connectives, and tense operators,and then by applying a set of formal deindexing rules, whichintroduce xplicit episodic variables into the LF, and tempo-rally relate these based on tense operators, temporal adver-bials, and context structures called tense trees.
These tensetrees, described in \[10, 22\], supply "orienting relations" be-tween episodes introduced by different clauses, such as therelation that exists between successively reported events in anarrative.
We should emphasize that our treatment of time ad-verbials is fully compatible and integrated with the treatmentof tense, but we will neglect ense o~rators and tense treesherein as far as possible.
We do need to mention, though, thattense operators are generally assumed to take wide scope overadverbials in the same clause.
Thus, after scoping, we get2Certain feature principles are assumed in the grammar--namely, certainversions of the head feature principle, the control agreement principle, and thesubeategorization principle.
Notice that in our system, features are treated astrees; e.g., the subtree rooted by feature mod-vp has daughters pre-vp andpost-vp, and the subtree rooted by feature -rood has daughters temp-loe,dur, t ime-span, freq, card, eyc-t ime, etc., where temp-loe in turn hasdaughters def-t ime, indef- t ime,  etc.3In general, \['r.
n: 1:1 ... 'r~l\] is an equivalent way of writing Or x, ...
'r.
),Which is in turn equivalent to 6.- ((g lrl)x2) ... "rn).
See \[9, 11\].
(past ((adv-e (during Yesterday)) \[Mary leave\])).Since the deindexing rules "work their way inward" on a givenindexical LF, starting with the outermost operator, the pasttense operator in the sentence under consideration will alreadyhave been deindexed when the adv-e construct isencountered.In fact we will have(2e1: \[el before ul \]\[((adv-e (during Yesterday)) \[Mary leave\]) T ** eli),where ul denotes the utterance vent for the sentence con-cerned, and T denotes the current ense tree.
Note that we userestricted quantitiers of form (Qa: ?
it0, where Q is a quanti-tier, a is a variable, and restriction ?
and matrix ~P are formu-las.
At this point the following deindexing rule for adv-e isbrought to bear (we omit the second half of the rule, specifyingthe transformation f the tense tree T ; see \[9, 11\]):For lr a monadic predicate, and ?
a formula,adv-e: ((adv-e g) ~)r  ~ \[VlrT ^ ~r-T\]This rule essentially splits the formula into a conjunction oftwo subformulas: one for the adverbial itself, the other forthe sentence modified by the adverbial, much as in Dowty'ssystem \[4, 5\].
To provide an intuitive xplanation of how thisworks, we need to mention the operators ' . '
and '**', whichare central to EL.
Roughly, \[~ ?
77\] means that ?
is true inepisode rI (or, 4~ describes rl), and \[el, ** 7/\] means that el,,and only O, is true in episode 71 (or, ?
characterizes 7/).
(Fordetails, see \[9, 11, 12\].)
Now the expression "nT on the RHS ofthe deindexing rule for adv-e is a sentential formula (formedfrom predicate ~T) which Can be read as "~T is true of thecurrent episode (i.e., the one at which vg T is evaluated)."
Inview of this, the combination\[Vnr ^  ~,~.r\] ** 7/\]is equivalent to \[\[\[71 ~T\] ^  @~.T\] ** 71\].
Note that nT is nowpredicated irectly of episode 71.
In the example above, weobtain(3e1: \[el before ud\[\[\[el during Yesterdayr\] A \[Mary leave\]\] ** ed),and this leaves only Yesterdayr to be deindexed to a spdcificday (that is, (yesterday-rel-to uO).To make the semantics of ,v, , , .
,  and'**' a little more precise,we mention two clauses from the truth-conditional semantics:1.
For ?
a formula, and rl a term,~ ?
7/\]\] s = 1 only if Actual (~rl~, s) and \ [ \ [~n~ = 1 ;= 0 only ifNonactual(lrl\],s) or IIO\]\] ~n\] ~ 1,where these conditionals become biconditionals (iffs)for s an exhaustive (informationally maximal) situation.2.
For s e S, and lr a predicate over situations,l\[V~ "= I\[~"', i.e., ~lr~(s)(s),where S is the set of possible situations.Also, a few relevant axioms are (for lr, rr" 1-place predicates,71 a term, and ?
a formula):139\[\] 13~ ** 7/\]~-~ \[\[~ * 7/\] A --1 (3e: \[e proper-subep-of 7/\] \ [ *  ?
e\])\]\[\] \["re A "re'\] ~ VZe\[\[e r \] A \[e re'\]\]\ [ \ ]  \[lYre ^ ~\ ]  ** 77\] ~ \[\[\[7/re\] A ~\]  ** 7/\]2.2.
Adverbials of Duration, Time-span, and RepetitionLike adverbials of temporal location, durafive adverbials arealso translated as (adv-e re).
For instance, "John slept for twohours" becomes (with tense neglected)((adv-e (lasts-for (K ((num 2) (plur hour))))) \[John sleep\]).Like dur ing,  las ts - fo r  is a 2-place predicate.
Here it hasbeen applied to a term (K...), leaving a 1-place predicate.
Justas in the case of (during Yesterday), the deindexed LF willcontain a predication stating that the episode characterized byJohn sleeping lasts for two hours.
(The details of the term(K...), denoting the abstract kind of quantity, two hours, neednot concern us here.
K as used here corresponds to K1 in\[9, 11\].)
Time-span adverbials (as in "John ran the race intwo hours") are treated in much the same way, using predicatein-span-of.The translation of cardinal and frequency adverbials involvesthe sentence-modifying construct (adv- f  re).
re is a predicatewhich applies to a collection of temporally separated episodes.It may describe the cardinality of the episodes or their fre-quency (i.e., their relative density), periodicity or distributionpattern.
So, for instance, we have((adv-f ((num 2) (plur episode))) \[John see Movie3\])for "John saw the movie twice," and((adv-f ((attr frequen0 (plur episode))) \[John call Mary\])for "John called Mary frequently."
(num is an operator thatmaps numbers into predicate modifiers, and p lur  ('plural') isa function that maps predicates applicable to individuals intopredicates applicable to collections; cf., Link \[13\].
agt r  ('at-tributive') is an operator that maps predicates into predicatemodifiers.)
Table 1 shows lexical rules and PP and ADVL ruleshandling large classes of frequency adverbials, including pe-riodic ones such as every two hours and synchronized cyclicones such as every spring.The deindexing rule for adv- f  is as follows:For re a monadic predicate, and cb a formula,adv- f :  ((adv-f re) ~)T ~ \["rer ^ (mult On.T)\]As illustrated in Table 1, re could take various forms, mult onthe RHS side of the rule is a function that transforms entenceintensions, and is defined as follows.For r 1 an episode, and ~ a formula,O \[(mult ~) ** 7/\]\[\[7/(plur episode)\] ^(Ve: \[e member-of ri\]\[\[~ ** e\] ^  ~ (3e" \[\[e" ~e\] ^  \[e" member-of ~/\] ^\[e" overlaps eli)\])\],Table 1: GPSG Fragment (Adverbials)% VP Adjunct RulesADVL ~-- PP\[e-mod, post-VP\] ; APAx((adv-e PP') \[x P\])ADVL <-- ADV\[e-mod, mod-VP\] ; APAx(ADV" Ix P\])VP ~--- VP ADVL\[mod-vp\] ; (ADVL', VP')% Temporal ADV, PP RulesNP\[def-fime\] ~ yesterday; YesterdayPP\[post-VP\] ~-- NP\[def-time\] ; (during NP')e.g., yesterday" =APAx((adv-e (during Yesterday)) \[x P\])N\[time-unit, plur\] ~-- hours; (plur hour)ADJ\[number, plur\] ~--- two; (num 2)N\[lbar, time-length\] ~ ADJ\[number\] N\[time-unit\] ; (ADJ" N')NP ~ N\[lbar, time-length\] ; (K N')P\[dur\] ~---for ; lasts-forP\[span\] ~-- in; in-span-ofPP\[e-mod, post-VP\] ~ P NP\[time-length\] ; (P' NP')e.g.,for two hours" = gPAx((adv-e (lasts-for(K((num 2) (plur hour))))) Ix P\])e.g., in two hours" = J!.PAx((adv-e (in-span-of(K ((num 2) (plur hour))))) \[x P\])ADV\[card, post-VP\] ~-- tw/ce; (adv-f ((num 2) (plur episode)))N.B.

EPILOG \[20\], the computer im-plementation of EL, makes inferences very efficiently, basedon such ELFs and world knowledge, aided by a "time special-ist."
For instance, given "There is a train to Boston every twohours," "A train left for Boston at 2:30," and appropriate ax-ioms, EPILOG Can infer that the next train would be at 4:30.
54This constraint on the Saturdays under consideration is assumed to beadded by the deindexing process for time- or event-denoting ominals, buthas been omitted from (5c).5The following kind of meaning postulates are assumed:a.
(Vs: \[s ((attr periodic) (plur episode))\](~n: \[In number\] ^ \[n ~ 2\]\] Is ((hum n) (plur episode))\]))A periodic ollection of episodes has at least wo component episodes.This kind of reasoning is very important in the TRAINS project\[1\], one of our target applications.We also have a tentative account of adverbials uch as con-secutively and alternately, and some non-PP adverbials, butcannot elaborate within the present space limitations.3.
AN EXTENSION: TEMPORAL ADVERBIALS ANDASPECTUAL CLASS SHIFTSSo far, we have assumed aspectual category agreement be-tween temporal adverbials and VPs they modify.
We now dis-cuss our aspectual class system and our approach to apparentaspectual class mismatch between vPs and adverbials, basedon certain aspectual class transformations.We make use of two aspectual class feature hierarchies,stativeness and boundedness as be low:  6st at ivene s s boundedne s si 'I I I I ifactual star telic unbounded boundedAtemporal (or, unlocated) sentences whose truth value doesnot change over space and time are assigned the featurefac tua l .
Every tensed English sentence, e.g., "Mary leftbefore John arrived," in combination with a context, isconsidered factual.
Untensed sentences may be stative ortelic, depending on the type of the preedicate (i.e., achieve-ment/accomplishment versus state/process predicates) and onthe object and subject (e.g., count versus mass).
Sentencesdescribing states or processes are assigned the feature s tar ,while those describing achievements or accomplishments areassigned the feature te l ie .By a co-occurrence restriction, factual formulas are un-bounded, and telics are bounded.
Statives are by default un-bounded.
Intuitively, a formula is bounded if the episodeit characterizes terminates in a distinctiveresult s ate (resultstates are formally defined in \[11\].)
This is a property we as-cribe to all telie episodes as well as to some stative episodes(such as an episode of John's being ill, at the end of which heb.
(Vk: \[k kind-of-timelength\] (Ve: \[\[e pisode\] ^ \[\[e lasts-for k\]\](3t: \[\[t time\] a \[(timelength-of 0 = k\]\] \[e throughout t\])))An episode lasting for a certain length of time means there is a timeof that length such that the temporal projections of the time and theepisode are identical.c.
(Ve(Vs: \[Is ((attr periodic) (plur episode))\] ^ \[s throughout e\]\](Vp: \[(period-of s )=p\ ]  (Vel: \[el member-of s\]\[\[(3e2:\[e2 irnmed-suecessor-in el s\]\[(dist (begin-of el)  (begin-of e2)) = p\]) v\[(dist (begin-of e1) (end-of e)) < p\]\] ^\[(3e3:\[e3 immed-predecessor-in el s\]\[(dist (begin-of ?
1) (begin-of e3)) = p\]) v\[(dist (begin-of el)  (begin-of e)) < p\]\]\]))))A component episode of a sequence of episodes with periodp has animmediate predecessor/successor that is apart from it by p unless it isthe firstllast element of the sequence.
The distance between the first/lastelement and the begirdend point of the episode the sequence permeatesis less than p.6Our aspecmal class system resembles Passonneau's \[18\] in that it makesuse of two orthogonal feature hierarchies, although the actual division of fea-tures is different from hers.141is not ill).
Conversely, a formula is unbounded if the episodeit characterizes does not terminate in a distinctive result state.For instance, was ill in "John was ill when I saw him last week"is unbounded as the sentence does not entail that John was notill right after the described episode.
However, when we say"John was ill twice last year," we are talking about bounded"ill" episodes.
7As has been discussed by many authors (e.g., in \[3, 6, 15, 17,26, 27\]), vPs and temporal adverbials may not arbitrarily com-bine.
Normally, durative adverbials combine with unboundedVPs; cardinal and frequency adverbials with bounded VPs; andadverbials of time-span with telic VPs.
Thus, for instance,Mary studied for an hour.
s*Mary finished the homework for a second.Mary called John twice I repeatedly  every five minutes.Mary wrote the paper/n two weeks.Note, however, that we also sayMary sneezed for Jive minutes.Mary stepped out of her office for \]fve minutes.Mary was ill twice \[ repeatedlyl every two months.The latter group of sentences show that VPs often acquire aninterpretation derived from their original, primitive meaning.More specifically, when "stative" adverbials are applied totelic VPs, usually iteration is implied, as in the first sentence.However, in the case of the second sentence, the preferredreading is one in which the adverbial specifies the duration ofthe resultant episode, i.e., "the result state of Mary's steppingout of her office" (i.e., her being outside of her office), ratherthan a reading involving iteration.
Next, when cardinal or fre-quency adverbials (i.e., "bounded" adverbials) are applied tounbounded-stative VPs, those VPs are interpreted as bounded-statives.
Thus, the third sentence above means that the kindof episode in which Mary becomes ill and then ceases to be illoccurred twice, repeatedly, etc.To be able to accommodate such phenomena, the syntacticparts of our grammar use s ta t  and bounded as agreement fea-tures.
The semantic parts introduce, as needed, operators foraspectual class transformation such as resu l t - s ta te ,  i te r(iteration), bounded, etc.
(In place of i te r ,  we may some-times use a habitual operator, It.
)Adverbials of temporal location like yesterday or last weekmay combine with either bounded or unbounded formulas(with unbounded ones, these imply a throughout reading; withbounded ones, a sometime during reading).
For instance, in"John left last month," the "leaving" episode took place some-time during last month, but in case of "Mary was ill lastmonth," Mary's "ill" episode may be either sometime during7Semanticany, stativeness and boundedness play an important rolewith respect to the persistence of a formula.
In general, stafive formulas areinward persistent (modulo granularity), and bounded formulas are outwardpersistent.
(Polarized ones are exceptional, however.)
See \[11\] for furtherdiscussion.SHowever, *Mary resembled her mother for five years, even though "re-sembling" is a typical stafive VE This indicates that compatibility betweenpredicates and adverbials involves more than just the aspeetual class compat-ibility; that is, pragmaties and world knowledge need to be considered.or throughout last month (corresponding to bounded and un-bounded readings of the VP).
Synchronized cyclic adverbialslike every spring or every time I saw Mary may combine withbounded or unbounded formulas.Secondly, an application of certain temporal adverbials of-ten induces shifts in the aspectual classes of the resultantVPs.
Frequency adverbials transform bounded sentencesinto unbounded-stative ones, while durative adverbials nor-mally yield bounded VPs and synchronized cyclic ones yieldunbounded-statives.
Thus,John {{was ill twice} in three years}.
?John { {was ill twice} for three years}.John { {was frequently ill} for three years}.
?John {{was frequently ill} in three years}.John { {worked for five hours} three times} last week.We now rewrite the VP adjunct rules introduced earlier to ac-commodate the interaction between vPs and adverbials andpossible shifts in aspectual classes.
9 We also show VP rulesthat perform aspectual class shifts.
Note that aspectual classfeatures (s tat ,  bounded, etc.)
are head features.VP <-- VP\[stat, unbounded\] ADVL\[dur\] ; (ADVL' VP')VP\[bounded\] ~ VP\[stat, unbounded\] ADVL\[dur\] ; (ADVL' VP')VP ~ VP\[bounded\] ADVL\[span\] ; (ADVL" VP')VP ~ VP\[bounded\] ADVL\[card\] ; (ADVL" VP')VP\[stat, unbounded\] ~ VP\[bounded\] ADVL\[freq\] ; (ADVL' VP')VP\[stat, unbounded\] ~ VP ADVL\[cye-time\] ; (ADVL' VP')VP\[bounded\] ~--VP\[stat, unbounded\] ; (bounded VP')VP\[stat, unbounded\] ~-- VP\[bounded\] ; (iter VP')VP\[stat, unbounded\] ~ VP\[telic\] ; (result-state VP')These rules allow transitions in aspectual class and VP-adverbial combinations somewhat too liberally.
We assume,however, that undesirable transitions and combinations may beruled out on semantic grounds.
We now show some additionalsentences and their initial translations (with tense neglected)to illustrate the above rules.

; and third, there is no one who slept dailyfor 8 hours for a week.
(9b), (9c) and (9d) provide these threereadings (distinguished by the scope of the quantifier No andthe adverbial for a week).
Note now that in (9a), the inner du-rative adverbial for eight hours transforms the unbounded VPto a bounded one.
Being another durative adverbial, however,the outer for a week requires that its argument be unbounded.This is not a problem as shown in ELFs (9b, c, d).
That is,in (9b), the argument is a negated formula which is normallyconsidered to be stative-unbounded, and in (9c) and (9d), theiter operator produces tative-unbounded formulas.4.
CONCLUSIONMuch theoretical work has been done on temporal adverbials(e.g., \[4, 5, 7, 14, 16, 19\]).
There is also some computation-ally oriented work.
For instance, H0bbs \[8\] provided sim-ple rules for some temporal adverbials, including frequencyones.
Moens and Steedman \[15\], among others, discussed theinteraction of adverbials and aspectual categories.
Our workgoes further, in terms of (1) the scope of syntactic overage,(2) interaction of adverbials with each other and with tenseand aspect, (3) systematic (and compositional) transductionfrom syntax to logical form (with logical-form deindexing),(4) formal interpretability of the resulting logical forms, and(5) demonstrable use of the resulting logical forms for infer-ence.Our initial focus in the analysis of temporal adverbials hasbeen PP-adverbials.
Remaining work includes the analysisof clausal adverbials.
Also, interactions with negation andaspect (perfect and progressive) have not been completelyworked out.
Negations of statives are statives, but negationsof bounded sentences may be either bounded or unbounded(cf., "We haven't met for thre e years" versus "I have friends Ihaven't met in three years").
The interaction between presentperfect and multiple adverbials of temporal location also cre-ates some subtle difficulties.
E.g., in "Mary has jogged {atdawn} {this month}," the inner time adverbial modifies the"jogging" episode, while the outer one modifies the intervalthat contains the "jogging" episode as well as the utterancetime.
See \[11\] for some relevant points.
Another issue thatrequires thought is adverbials involving implicit anaphoricreferents.
Consider, e.g., "Shortly, Mary came in," "Johncame back in ten minutes," and "After three years, John pro-posed to Mary."
These adverbials involve an implicit refer-ence episode.
Such implicit referents may often be identi-fied from our tense trees, but at other times require inference.Another important remaining issue is the interaction betweenevent nominals and frequency adjectives (along the lines of\[25\]).1?Here, iterated sleep is understood asdaily sleep--something that mustbe determined bypragmaties.References1.
