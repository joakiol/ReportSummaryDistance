Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Hybrid Approaches to Translation (HyTra) @ EACL 2014, page 96,Gothenburg, Sweden, April 27, 2014. c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsHow to overtake Google in MT quality - the Baltic caseAndrejs VasiljevsTilde CompanyVienibas gatve 75aLV1004 RigaLATVIAAndrejs@Tilde.lvAbstractMotivation of the language technology company Tilde is to improve quality of machine translationfor lesser resourced languages such as the languages of Baltic countries.
Generic MT solutions likeGoogle Translate perform poorly for these complex languages.
To compensate the shortage oftraining data and to deal with rich morphology we are applying different approaches in combiningstatistical methods with linguistic rules.
We will present the strategies applied and the results ofvarious experiments.
We will discuss application of the production systems that show significantlybetter translation quality comparing to the Google Translate.
We will also outline how this workcontributes to creation of the European infrastructure for automated translation.96
