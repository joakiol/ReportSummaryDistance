AN AUTOMATIC TRANSLATION SYSTEM OF NON-SEGMENTED KANA SENTENCES INTO KANJI-KANA SENTENCESHiroshi MakinoFaculty of Engineering Science, Osaka UniversityMachikaneyama-eho, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, JAPANand Makoto KizawaUniversity of Library and Information ScienceYatabe-machi, Tsukuba-gun, Ibaraki-ken 305,JAPANSum~laryThis paper p resents  the a lgor i thms to  so lvethe two main problems comprised in  the automaticKana-KanJi t rans la t ion  system, in which theinput  sentences in Kana are t rans la ted  in toord inary  Japanese sentences in  Kanj i  and Kana :the segmentat ion of  non-segmented sentences in toBunsetsu and the word ident i f i ca t ion  from homo-nyms.
Employing this algorithm, non-segmentedKana input sentences could be automaticallytranslated into KanJi and Kana output sentenceswith 96.2 per cent success.IntroductionIn the computer processing of the Japaneselanguage informations, the input method is muchmore difficult than in other Indo-Europeanlanguages because thousands of kinds of charac-ters in mainly two classes, KanJi(ideograms) andKana(phonograms), are used together in writingregular sentences.Conventional Japanese typewriters areequipped with least 2000 KanJi(Chinese charac-ters) which are frequently used in daily use.A typewrite of this sort is difficult for us tohandle and its typing speed is much lower thanthat of alphabetic typewriters because operatorsmust look for characters one by one.One of the most promising inputmethods toovercome this intrinsic input difficulty isKana-KanJi translation system, in which all thesentences are input with Kana only using aregular 44-Key keyboard and then translated intoregular KanJi-Kana sentences automatically inthe computer.The automatic translation system consists oftwo processes; the segmentation and the wordidentification processes.The problem 9 iP Kana-Kap~i translationThe problems in Kana-KanJi translation are:(a) segmentation of input sentences.
(b) word identification from homonyms.These problems are basic in the processingof Japanese sentences as language informations.Japanese sentences in KanJi and Kana have nospaces between words as English ones do.
However,in order to make the computer process Kanasentences easy, it would be necessary to put aspace as a segmental symbol between words orsome units in sentences.
Therefore, some spacingmethods, listed in Fig.l(concluding non-segment-ed sentence for convenience), was already adopt-13  ed in Kana-Kanji translation systems.

(i) segmented between words(2) segmented between an independent wordand a sequence of dependent words(3) segmented between Bunsetsu(4) segmented between KanJi and Kana(5) non-segmentedFig.1 Examples of segmentations in a Japanesesentence.However, these pre-editing methods of wordsegmentation or unit segmentation are not onlyan too laborious for most of the Japanese peoplewho are not accustomed in segmenting each sen-tence into words but also apt to be erroneous.It is, therefore, necessary in Kana-KanJi trans-lation system to segment the Kana strings intowords or other units automatically.The number of different syllables in Japa-nese is much less than in English or in Chinese,while the number of KanJi is much more.
Conse-quently, there are many groups of KanJi whichhave the same pronunciation.
This fact makesword identification more difficult in Kana-KanJitranslation since there is no one-to-one corre-spondence between KanJi and Kana.
For example,Kana strings '= ~ ~ y'corresponds to 25 words inan ordinary dictionary and a part of these areshown below.Example.Kana KanJi a meaning~ a battle~ a resistance~ an iron ship--295~ a bea .~ a public electionH~ a commission~ a mineral springThe segmentation processBunsetsuA Japanese sentence is composed of the sequencesof syntactic units called Bunsetsu pronouncedwithout pausing.
Bunsetsu usually consists oftwo parts: an independent part and a dependentpart.
The independent part consists of an inde-pendent word or its derivative, and the de-pendent part consists of a sequence of dependentwords, given as follows:Bunsetsu=(independent part).
(dependent part)independent part=\[prefix\].
(independent word).\[suffix\]dependent part=\[dependent word\]*independent word=noun/pronoun/adverbs/verb/adjective/verbal adjective/attributive/conjuction/interjectiondependent word=auxil iary verb/particle orpostpositionHere, brackets indicate optionality, the aster-isk indicates one or more repititions or non-existing and the slants indicate alternatives.The independent words('J iritsugo') aredivided into two main groups: inflected wordswhich consist of verbs, adjectives and verbaladjectives('keiyodoshi'), and non-inflectedwords which consist of nouns, pronouns andothers.
On the other hands the dependent wordsconsist of particles and auxiliary verbs whichhave their inflections.There are grammatical connectabilities be-tween a preceding word and its succeeding wordin Bunsetsu.
This is explained using an examplein Fig.2.ikanakerebanaranakatta (had to go)V AUX P AUX AUX AUXV:verbs, AUX:auxiliary verb, P:particleFig.2 An example of BunsetsuAn indicative form 'ika' of a verb 'iku' can beconcatenated not only by inflectional form'nakere' of auxiliary verb 'nai' in this examplebut also by all of inflectional forms of 'nai'.And the particle 'ba' is preceded by the con-ditional form of 'nai'.
Thus, these propertiesare decided upon each inflectional form of thepreceding word(if the word is an inflected word)and its succeeding word.
These connectabilityfeatures in Bunsetsu constitute the basis of thesegmentation of Kana strings described in latersections.The lonsest string-match method of two BunsetsuFor segmentation, each independent word is,in the order of length, first separated bycomparing the Kana strings with the vocabularyof a word dictionary, and is stored with theinformations such as parts of speech andinflectional forms if necessary for furthermorhological analysis.Then, the dependent words in the rest of thestrings are recognized using the dependent-wordlist and grammatical connectabilities betweenthe dependent word and the independent word areexamined.
This analysis is continued until nosucceeding word is found in the successive Kanastrings.
Thus, the candidates of a Bunsetsu areextracted from Kana strings as below.Example.souiuzassiwo ... (a part of strings)sou i  .
.
.
(noun)sou.iu ... (adverb.auxiliary verb)sou ... (verb)The same analysis as mentioned above is exe-cuted for the rest of the strings from whicheach candidate of Bunsetsu is separated.Consequently, the sequence of two candidatesof Bunsetsu is extracted from Kana strings, andthen the Bunsetsu in the sentence is appropri-ately identified so as to make the total lengthof two consecutive strings of their candidatesmaximum.
This algorithm decides only the bounda-ry between two consecutive Bunsetsu.
In otherwords, the preceding Kana strings and these con-stituents for the Bunsetsu are recognized.
Onthe other hand, the decisions for succeedingBunsetsu are tentative at this stage.These processes named as the longest string-match method of two Bunsetsu 4 are executedsentence by sentence and at length the inputsentences are converted into Bunsetsu and homo-nyms in Bunsetsu are stored.
An example isillustrated in Fig.3.souiuzasshiwo...i) souiu zasshiwo...2) soul...3) soui iu...Fig.3 Segmentation process of Kanastrings by the longest string-match method of two Bunsetsu.The successive candidates of Bunsetsu in i) and3) are compared since the succeeding Kanastrings are not analyzed in 2).
As the totallength of two analyzed strings in i) is longerthan that in 3), the segmentation in i), namelythe Bunsetsu 'souiu' is decided as the result.296The proccessin5 of unknown wordsThe longest string-match method of twoBunsetsu is based on the grammatical character-risties of the words, and so is not applicableto unknown words to the word dictionary.
Hence,it would be easily expected that the appearanceof an unknown word in a sentence makes thesegmentation impossible.
Therefore, it is neces-sary in non-segmented sentences to take accountof the processing of unknown words.The dependent words are divided into twomain groups by their connectability character-istics.
One is the word class, named is A, thatis preceded by nouns or non-inflected words.
Theother is the word class that is preceded by in-flected words and is further sub-divided intofour sub-classes, named as B, C, D and E, ac-cording to the preceding word conjugations whichare of indefinite form, conjunction form, finalform and conditional form, repectively.
The de-pendent words and their classes of connect-abilities are given in Table i.Table i Classification onconnectability of dependent words.words class words classnonitewohatagadadetomonaimasukaradesuhekabamadeAACAACAAAAABCAAAAEAyaunadodakeZUdemoyorinagarataran'tarishirashiibekinakubakarishikataruABAACAACCBCDADCAAANow, suppose that the search for the worddictionary fails.
Then, the word in the abovedependent word list is searched for the rest ofthe strings without being segmented.
If a de-pendent word is found and its preceding Kanacorresponds to an inflected word-ending suc-ceeded by it vowels of inflectional endingsof indefinite, conjunction, final and condition-al forms are '-a', '-i' or '-e', '-u' and '-e',respectively, then the dependent word is recog-nized and its succeeding Kana strings are ana-lyzed morphologically as mentioned in the pre-ceding section.
Consequently, the dependent wordsequences are extracted and utilized for nextsegmentation.The word identification process among homon~L~As mentioned above, a part of words in inputsentences is identified in grammatical or.mor-phological analysis, But there are still manyhomonyms which have the same grammatical charac-teristics in general.
Therefore, further wordidentification will need for syntactical andsemantical analyses in a given sentence.The usage dictionaryThe usage dictionary contains the infor-mations of word uses which play an importantrole on word identification from homonyms.Informations of word uses would be dividedinto two groups: colloqual information of wordssuch as derivatives, compound words and ideoms,and semantic informations such as "semanticpattern" representative of nouns and verbs.Case relations accompanied with verbs in asentence are explicitly marked with particlesattached by nouns.
Usually, the particles 'ga','wo' and 'ni' indicate nominative, objective anddative respectively, whose case relations arefundamental, and so these are called 'ga' case,'wo' case and 'ni' case, respectively.Accordingly, the so-called case frame of eachverb has been studied with an emphasis on theseparticles.Example.\[watashi\] ga aruke \[I\] walk\[hon\] wo yomu read \[book\]\[mono\] ni sawaru touch \[thing\]where, Ix\] means a semantic feature or semanticcategory of x.One of difficulties of doing the work is thesemantic classification of each word.
To avoidthis burden, the semantic category of each wordis identified according to the system of "TheWord List by Semantic Principles" edited by theNational Language Research Institute, in whichabout 32,600 words are divided into 798 semanticcategories.5The particle 'ni' also occurs after locativenoun which mean the location.
However, it isempirically assumed that either locative nounsor dative nouns occur with each verb in a simplesentence.
The example is given as follows,\[hito\] ni \[ie\] ni itta...said to the men to the house......wentThe above example is unusual and this factmeans that semantic features of nouns with 'hi'are derived from surface structures ofsentences.The case frame 6 of each verb is different,and so semantic categories of nouns and standardparticles used as semantical "identifiers" aredescribed in the usage dictionary.297Example.Kaku : \[hito\] ga \[ji\] wo \[kami\] ni \[dougu\] dewrite ~ HUMAN LETTER PAPER INSTRUMENTiku : \[hito\] ga \[basho\] kara \[basho\] hego : HUMAN LOCATION LOCATIONThe particles 'de', 'kara', and 'he' withrespective semantic categories are filled up inthe usage dictionary in the above example.For adjectives and verbal adjectives, seman-tic categories of nominative nouns are onlyfilled up in the usage dictionary.
The exampleis given as follows:utsukushii : \[hana\] gabeautiful : FLOWERkireida : \[hana\] gapretty : FLOWERWhere, 'kireida' is a verbal adjective in Japa-nese which corresponds to an adjective inEnglish.
As a result, we have investigated"semantic pattern" for 3421 inflected wordswhich consist of verbs, adjectives, verbaladjectives and verbs conjugated with 'suru'which are called 'sahenmeishi', since their wordstems are regarded as nouns in Japanese.
Thesewords are extracted from the vocabulary frequen-cy table edited by ~he National LanguageResearch Institute.
rOn the other hand, informations about nouns,namely, their derivatives composed with prefixesand suffixes, compound words and idioms are col-lected from an ordinary dictionary.UThe exampleof a part of the usage dictionary is i l lustlatedin Fig.4.i n d teem prefix 'suffix !
compound case word, idiom ~a wo ni others!\[Fig.4 A part of the usage dictionaryThe parsingAfter segmenting sentences into Bunsetsu,the parsing phase begins, in order not to takeout so-called tree structures but to extract thesyntactic relations between Bunsetsu or words.The parsing of the sentence is executed on thebasis of the Kskariuke relations(something likethe dependency relations) between Bunsetsu.
TheKakariuke is the term in Japanese traditionalschool grammar.Characteristics of Kakariuke relations in asentence are given as follows:(i) A final word or an inflectional form in aBunsetsu decides what kinds of words tomodify, on the other hand each of theindependent words decides how to bemodified.
(2) Each Bunsetsu as a dependent always appearsbefore its governor in a sentence.
(3) Kakariuke relations between any two Bunsetsudo not cross with each other in a sentence.For simplicity of the parsing, we adoptedthe following two assumptions that would be cor-rect in most sentences.
(4) A Kakariuke relation is decided on thesmallest distance between a dependent andits probable governors.
(5) Each Bunsetsu can be a dependent of only oneBunsetsu appearing after it except theBunsetsu at the end of a sentence.The relations among Bunsetsu are searchedtaking account of the following three factors:five conditions mentioned above, final word asa dependent and an independent word class as agovernor.
The term noun phrase is used forBunsetsu in which an independent part is a noun,and similarly a verb phrase for Bunsetsu con-sisting of a verb and its dependent part.
But,for the phrase of the form of a noun and some ofauxiliary verbs, which are called as copulas('desu', 'da' etc.
), it is necessary to regardthe phrase as a predicate in a sentence.Examplekano~o ~ / watashi 7-n?
/ musume~ des~(She is my daughter.
)In the above example, an underline denotes aword and a slant does a segmental symbol betweenBunsetsu.
An arrowed line denotes the Kakariukerelation between Bunsetsu.
Usually, theKakariuke relation between Bunsetsu, 'watashino'and 'musamedesu', is determined by the particle'no' and the noun 'musume', on the other handthe relation between 'kanojowa' and 'musumedesu'is determined by the particle 'ha' and the aux-iliary verb 'desu'.The pre-processin6 for the word identificationIn Japanese, the different semantic re-lations are reduced to the same syntactic re-lations of verbs with nouns intermediated byparticles in active voice as in passive voice.The passive or causative voice is representedexplicitly by the attachment of auxiliary verbs('reru, rareru') or auxiliary verbs('seru,saseru') to inflectional forms of verbs.Accordingly, the semantic normalization isnecessary in the cases below.298(i) passive:Ni ga N2 ni V+reru(or rareru).--~ N2 ga N1 ni V.(ii) causative:N1 ga N2 ni N3 wo V+seru(or saseru).N2 ga N3 wo V.where Ni, N2 and N3 denotes a noun and V denotesa transitive verb.
The auxiliary verbs (reru andseru) are used for the consonant conjugationverbs(godan katsuyo doshi), on the other handthe auxiliary verbs(rareru and saseru) for thevowel conjugation verbs(ichidan katsuyo doshi).The meaning of independent part whichconsists of an independent and a suffix issubstituted for the meaning of its suffix.Similarly, the meaning of the numbor that con-sists of the set of the numeral plus counter isrepresentative of the meaning of its counter.Example\[nihon+jin\] ---~\[Jin\]\[lO0+nin\] __,\[nin\]where,'jin'and'nin' are a suffix and a counter,respectively that mean the word "human".The dependent part composed of more than twodependent words are substituted for a dependentword representing a case in order to consult theusage dictionary in next steps.ExampleTokyo.he.mo itta ~ Tokyo.he itta(went to Tokyo, too) (went to Tokyo)Word selections from homonymsWord selections from homonyms an executedusing both colloqual informations and infor-mations about cases with verbs.Word selection based on noun-to-verb relationWord selections from homonyms are executedparticle attached to each noun.
At that time,each particle is converted into the "standardparticle" in the preprocessing phase.
And so,each semantic category of homonyms (nouns) iscompared with the corresponding semantic cate-gory code in the usage dictionary, and the mostmatched word is selected.
When homonyms areverbs, the verb and the nouns as case elementsof the verb are selected taking account of thenumbers of case found in the sentence.
Thenouns related with verbs intermediated by theparticle 'no' are referredto the nominativenouns.
As it is assumed that the noun attachedby copulas such as 'desu' are in the synonymousrelation to nominative nouns, each pair isselected from homonyms.As it is difficult to estimate the case re-lations between verbs and nouns modified bytheir verbs because of no occurrence of parti-cles, the reference to the case elements notidentified yet are tried.
In the example below,the words 'hon' are examined whether they arenominative or objective elements of the verb'morau'.Kare ni moratta hon (book received from him )- - - r -m- - r -hon ga morauhon wo morauWord selection based on noun-to-noun relationsFor the Bunsetsu composed of prefixes and/orsuffixes and independent words, the derivativeis decided according to their prefixes andsuffixes in the usage dictionary.When the successive nouns are found, eachregistration is examined, and the registeredword in the usage dictionary is selected if any.Informations as for idioms are also, re-ferred for nouns and verbs in the Kakariuke re-lation because ~heir words are identified incolloqual expressions.
In the sequence of twonouns, either of which is 'sahenmeishi', it isoften assumed that the semantical relation be-tween two nouns is based on the case relationbecause 'sahenmeishi' also have the character-istics as verbs.Examplejouhou shori (information processing)Jouhou wo shorisuru (... process infor-mations...)The semantic category of alternative nouns'jouhou' are compared with semantic categoriesof case elements of a verb 'shori + suru' are so"~$~' is selected from homonyms(-kJY~J~, etc.
)As it is assumed that two nouns intermedi-ated by the conjunctive particles('to', 'ya','dano', 'nari', etc.)
are in the relation of thesame or similar semantic categories.The pair of nouns is selected, whosesemantic category codes are close to each other.A synonym and antonym are included in the samesemantic category as shown in the followingexample.ExampleSensei to reiju( absolutism and slavery )The most frequent word is selected for homo-nyms undetermined by the analysis of word uses.DictionariesImplementatio,n- 299The dictionaries for this Kana-Kanji trans-lation system are given in Table.2 with a briefexplanation.

At a re-sult, the output sentence is acquired in (III).Experimental ResultIn order to evaluate translation efficiency,2592 Bunsetsu in 214 sentences were chosen fromvarious literatures, magazines, articles etc.Results of the experiment is shown inTable 3.Table 3 Experimental resultsegmentation translationcorrect 98.8 % 96.2 %error 1.2 % 3.8 %Translation errors are classified intosegmentation errors and word selection errors.Segmentation errors are divided into errorscaused by the longest string-match method of twoBunsetsu, unknown word and grammatical incom-pleteness, whose examples are denoted at (i),(2) and (3) in Table 4, respectively.Errors by the longest string-match methodof two Bunsetsu occurred on seven boundaries ofBunsetsu in the data.On the other hand, word selection errors areapparently due to the uses of word frequencies.However, the true causes of errors are due toincompleteness of homonym analysis.
They aregiven as follows; not taking account of thesegmentical relation underlying between nounsformed with the noun phrase pattern"noun + 'no'+ noun", not identifying the meaning of pronounin context, not identifying the ambiguitiesbetween case relations and other semantic re-lations, for example, such as adverbial re-lation for verbs, Their examples in the dataare illustrated in (4), (5) and (6) of Table 4,respectively.

Moreover, an experimentalsystem was constructed to make sure of theirefficiency.
As a result of experiments 96.2 percent of the whole Bunsetsu in input sentenceswere seccessfully translated into Kanji wherethey should be.For promoting applicabilities of thissystem, we are going to prepare the dictionaryincluding about 30,000 words in daily use.The difficulties in Kana-Kanji translationis based on ambiguities about the utterance,accordingly, further studies on understandingsentences would be needed for overcoming thesedifficultes.Acknpwled@ementsWe would like to thank Mr. Masakazu Okadafor his cooperation in this work.The research described in this paper waspartially supported by the Ministry of Edu-cation Science and Culture in 1979.References\[i\] I.
