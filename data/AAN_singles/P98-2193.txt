uni-stuttgart, deAbst ractThis paper studies and evaluates disambigua-tion strategies for the translation of tense be-tween German and English, using a bilingualcorpus of appointment scheduling dialogues.
Itdescribes a scheme to detect complex verb pred-icates based on verb form subcategorization a dgrammatical knowledge.
The extracted verband tense information is presented and the roleof different context factors is discussed.1 I n t roduct ionA problem for translation is its context depen-dence.
For every ambiguous word, the part ofthe context relevant for disambiguation must beidentified (disambiguation strategy), and everyword potentially occurring in this context mustbe assigned a bias for the translation decision(disambigt, ation information).
Manual con-struction of disambiguation components i  quitea chore.
Fortunately, the task can be (partly)automated if the tables associating words withbiases are learned from a corpus.
Statisticalapproaches also support empirical evaluation ofdifferent disambiguation strategies.The paper studies disambiguation strategiesfor tense translation between German and En-glish.
The experiments are based on a corpusof appointment scheduling dialogues counting150,281 German and 154,773 English word to-kens aligned in 16,857 turns.
The dialogues wererecorded, transcribed and translated in the Ger-man national Verbmobil project that aims todevelop a tri-lingual spoken language transla-tion system.
Tense is interesting, since it oc-curs in nearly every sentence.

(1) a. Ich habe ihn gestern gesehen.I have him yesterday seenI saw him yesterday.b.
Ich schlage Montag vor.I beat Monday forwardI suggest Monday.c.
Ich mSchte mich beschweren.I 'd like to myself weigh downI'd like to make a complaint.For translation, the discontinuous words mustbe amalgamated into single semantic items.Single words or pairs of lemma and part ofspeech tag (L-POS pairs) are not appropriate.To verify this claim, we aligned the L-POS pairsof the Verbmobil corpus using the completelylanguage-independent method of Dagan etal.
(1993).

Present sehenwas frequently translated into perfect discover.11833 Par t ia l  Pars ingA full syntactic analysis of the sort of unre-stricted spoken language text found in the Verb-mobil corpus is still beyond reach.
Hence, wetook a partial parsing approach.3.1 Complex  Verb  Pred icatesBoth German and English exhibit complex verbpredicates (CVPs), see (2).
Every verb and verbparticle belongs to such a CVP and there is onlyone CVP per clause.
(2) He would not have called me up.The following two grammar fragments describethe relevant CVP syntax for English and Ger-man.
Every auxiliary verb governs only oneverb, so the CVP grammar is basically 2 regu-lar and implementable with finite-state devices.S --+ ... VP .. .VP --+ hd:V (to) VPVP --+ hd:V .. .

(3) Versuchen h/itte ich es schon gerne wollen.try 'd have I it liked toI'd have liked to try it.3.2 Verb  Form Subcategor i za t ionAuxiliary verbs form a closed class.
Thus, theset sub(v) of infinite verb forms for which anauxiliary verb v subcategorizes can be specifiedby hand.
English and German auxiliary verbsgovern the following verb forms.?
infinitive e.g.
will?
to-infinitive (T) e.g.
want?
past participle (P) e.g.
get?
P V T e.g.
have?
present participle V P V T e.g.
be?
infinitive (I) e.g.
miissen?
zu-infinitive (Z) e.g.
scheinen?
perf.part, with haben (H) e.g.
bekommen?
H V I e.g.
werden?
H V I V Z e.g.
haben?
perf.part, with sein V H V I V Z e.g.sein3.3 TransducersTwo partial parsers (rather: transducers) areused to detect English and German CVPsand to translate them into predicate argumentstructures (verb chains).
The parsers presup-pose POS tagging and lemmatization.
A database associates verbs v with sets mor(v) of pos-sible tenses or infinite verb forms.Let m = \[{mor(v) : Verb vi i  andn  = I{sub(v):Verb v }\[.
Then the English CVP parser needsn + 1 states to encode which verb forms, ifany, are expected by a preceding auxiliary verb.Verb particles are attached to the precedingverb.
The German CVP parser is more compli-cated, but also more restrictive as all verbs ina verb complex (VC) must be adjacent.
It op-erates in left-headed (S) or right-headed mode(VC).
In VC-mode (i.e.
inside VCs) the orderof the verbs put on the output tape is reversed.In S-mode, n + 1 states again record the verbform expected by a preceding finite verb Vfi n-VC-mode is entered when an infinite verb formis encountered.
A state in VC-mode records theverb form expected by Vii n (n + 1), the infiniteverb form of the last verb encountered (rn), andthe verb form expected by the VC verb, if theVC consists of only one verb (n + 1).
So thereare m ?
(n + 1) 2 states.
As soon as a non-verb isencountered in VC-mode or the verb form of theprevious verb does not fit the subcategorizationrequirements of the current verb, a test is per-formed to see if the verb form of the last verb1184i00000 I00000i0000I000I00i010pluperf.preterite perfectI I Ipast perfect ?past -~- - -  Afuture past -G - - -  /, xpresent perfect "~( ...... /' "xpresent -~" - ' , .

If itdoes or there is no such finite verb, one CVP hasbeen detected.
Else Vfin forms a separate CVP.In case the VC consists of only one verb thatcan be interpreted as finite, the expected verbform is recorded in a new S-mode state.
Sep-arated verb prefixes are attached to the finiteverb, first in the chain.3.4 Al ignmentIu the CVP alignment, only 78 % of the turnsproved to have CVPs on both sides, only 19 %had more than one CVP on some side.
CVPswere further aligned by maximizing the trans-lation probability of the full verbs (yielding16,575 CVP pairs).
To ensure correctness, turnswith multiple CVPs were inspected by hand.In word alignment inside CVPs, surplus tense-bearing auxiliary verbs were aligned with atense-marked NULL auxiliary (similar to theEnglish auxiliary do).3.5 Alignment ResultsThe domain biases the corpus towards the fu-ture.
So only 5 out of 6 German tenses and12 out of 16 English tenses occurred in the cor-pus.
Both will and be going to were analysed asfuture, while would was taken to indicate con-ditional mood, hence present.?

Precision figuresgive the proportion of source tense tokens tsthat the strategy correctly translates to targettense tt, recall gives the proportion of source-target tense pairs that the strategy finds out.
(4) precisiontr(ts, tt) =P (T  = ttl S = ts, tr(ts) = tt)recalltr ( ts, tt ) =P(tr ( ts)  = ttl S = ts, T = tt)Combined precision and recall values are formedby taking the sum of the frequencies in numer-ator and denominator for all source and targettenses.
Performance was cross-validated withtest sets of 10 % of all CVP pairs.4.1 BaselineA baseline strategy assigns to every sourcetense the most likely target tense (tr(ts) =arg maxttP(tt\[ts),  strategy t).
The most likelytarget tenses can be read off Figures 1 and 2.Past tenses rarely denote logical past, as dis-cussion circles around a future meeting event,they are rather used for politeness.
(5) a. Ich wollte Sie fragen, wie das aussieht.I wanted to ask you what is on.b.
iibermorgen war ich ja auf diesem Kon-gref~ in Ziirich.the day after tomorrow, I'll be (lit: was)at this conference in Zurich.4.2 Full Verb InformationThree more disambiguation strategies condi-tion the choice of tense on the full verb ina CVP, viz.
the source verb (tr(ts,vs) --arg maxttP(tt l ts ,vs) ,  strategy vs), the targetverb (tr(ts,vt),  strategy vt), and the combina-tion of source and target verb (tr(ts, (vs,vt)),strategy vst).
The table below gives preci-sion and recall values for these strategies andfor the strategies obtained by smoothing (e.g.Vst, Vs, Vt, t is Vst smoothed first with vs, thenwith vt, and finally with t).
Smoothing with tresults in identical precision and recall figures.tVsVtVstVst, Ut, VsVst, Vs, VtG~Eprec.

Translation pairs approx-imate the verb semantics better than singlesource or target verbs.
The full verb contexts oftenses can also be used for verb classifications.Aspectua l  classif ication: The aspect of averb often depends on its reading and thus canbe better extrapolated from an aligned corpus(e.g.
I am having a drink (trinken)).
Germanallows punctual events in the present, Englishprefers present perfect (e.g.
sehen, finden, fest-stellen(discover, find, see), einfallen (occur, re-member);  treffen, erwischen, sehen (meet)).Wor ld  knowledge:  In many cases perfectmaps an event to its result state.finishforgetdenken ansich verabredensich vertunsettle a question4.3 Subordinating=~ fertig sein=~ nicht mehr wissen=~ have in mind=~ have an appointmentbe wrong(the question) is settledConjunctionsConjunctions often engender different mood.?
In conditional clauses English past tenses usu-ally denote present enses.
Interpreting hypo-thetical past as present increases performanceby about 0.3 %.1186* In subjunctive nvironments logical future isexpressed by English simple present.
The verbsvorschlagen (suggest) (in 11 out of 14 cases) andsagen (say) (2/5) force simple present on verbsthat normally prefer a translation to future.
(6) I suggest hat we meet on the tenth.. Certain matrix verbs 3 trigger translation ofGerman present o English future.4.4 Representation of TenseTense can not only be viewed as a single item(as sketched above, representation rt).
In com-positional analyses of tense, source tense S andtarget tense T are decomposed into compo-nents (S1 , .
.
.
, Sn) and (T1,... ,Tn).
A disam-biguation strategy tr is correct if Vi : tr(Si) =T,.One decomposition is suggested by the en-coding of tense on the surface ((present/past,O / will/ be going to/werden, O/ have/ haben/ sein,0/be), representation rs).
Another widelyused framework in tense analysis (Reichenbach,1947) ( (E</~/>R,  R</~/>S,  ?progr), repre-sentation rr) analyses English tenses as follows:R~S R<S R>SE~R present pastE<R present perf.
past perf.

The pertaining disambiguation i forma-tion learned from the corpus is put into actionin the symbolic transfer component of the Verb-mobil system (Dorna and Emele, 1996).The only other empirical study of tense transla-tion (Santos, 1994) I am aware of was conductedon a manually annotated Portuguese-Englishcorpus (48,607 English, 43,492 Portuguese wordtokens and 6,334 tense translation pairs).
It nei-ther gives results for all tenses nor considers dis-ambiguation factors.
Still, it acknowledges thesurprising divergence of tense across languagesand argues against the widely held belief thatsurface tenses can be mapped directly into aninterlingual representation.
Although the find-ings reported here support this conclusion, itshould be noted that a bilingual corpus can onlygive one of several possible translations.Re ferencesIdo Dagan, Kenneth W. Church, and William A.Gale.
