Tuples, Discontinuity, and Gapping in Categorial Grammar*Glyn Morril l  t & Teresa Solias ttDepartament de Llenguatges i Sistemes InformgticsUniversitat Polit~cnica de CatalunyaEdifici F I B, Pau Gargallo, 508028 Barcelonae-maih morrill@lsi.upc.estDepartamento deFilologfa Espafiola (Lingfiistica)Universidad e ValladolidFacultad e Filosoffa y Letras, Plaza de la Universidad, s/n47001 Valladolide-mail: solias@cpd.uva.esAbstractThis paper solves some puzzles in the for-malisation of logic for discontinuity in cat-egorial grammar.
A 'tuple' operation intro-duced in \[Solias, 1992\] is defined as a modeof prosodic combination which has associ-ated projection functions, and consequentlycan support a property of unique prosodicdecomposability.
Discontinuity operatorsare defined model-theoretically b  a resid-uation scheme which is particularly arn-menable proof-theoretically.
This enablesa formulation which both improves on thelogic for wrapping and infixing of \[Moort-gat, 1988\] which is only partial, and resolvessome problems of determinacy of insertionpoint in the application of these proposalsto in-sits binding phenomena.
A discontin-uons product is also defined by the residu-ation scheme, enabling formulation of rulesof both use and proof or a 'substring' prod-uct that would have been similarly doomedto partial logic.We show how the apparatus enables char-acterisation of discontinous functors suchas particle verbs and phrasal idioms, andbinding phenomena such as quantifier ais-ing and pied piping.
We conclude by show-ing how the apparatus enables asimple cat-egorial analysis of (SVO) gapping using thediscontinuity product and the wrapping op-erator.
*The work by Glyn Morrill was for the most part car-ried out under the support of the Ministerio de Edu.caciJn V Ciencia, Madrid, in the form of visting scholar-ship grant SB90 P413308C.1 IntroductionIn \[Lambek, 1958\] the suggestive r cursive fractionalcategorial notations of \[Ajdukiewicz, 1935\] and \[Bar-Hillel, 1953\] were provided with a foundational set-ting in mathematical logic.
This takes the form of amodel theory interpreting category formulas in alge-braic structures.
A Gentzen style sequent proof the-ory for which there is a Cut-elimination result meansthat a decision procedure is provided on the basis ofsequent calculus.The category formulas are freely generated fromatomic category formulas (e.g.
N for referring nom-inals, S for sentences, CN for common nouns, .
.
.
)by binary operators \ ('under'), / ('over') and ?('product').
The interpretation is in semigroups,i.e.
algebras (L, +) where + is a binary operationsatisfying the associativity axiom sl + (s~ + s3) =(sl + s2) + s3.
(In the non-associative formulationof \[Lambek, 1961\], this condition is withdrawn.)
Wemay in particular consider the algebra obtained bytaking the set V* of strings over a vocabulary V;then L is V* - {t} where t is the empty string.
Eachcategory formula A is interpreted as a subset D(A) ofL.
Given such a mapping for atomic category formu-las it is extended to the compound category formulasthus:D(A\B)  = {sirs' ~ D(A),s'  + s E D(B)} (1)D(B/A)  -- {slVd E D(A),s + s' E D(B)}D(A*B) = {sl + s213Sl e D(A),s2 e D(B)}In general we may define L in terms of a semigroupalgebra (L*, +, t) where f E L is an identity element,i.e.
an element such that s + t = t + s -- s; thenL is L* - {t}.
In the sequent calculus of \[Lambek,1958\] a sequent is of the form A1,.
.
.
,  An =~ A wheren > 0,1 and is read as asserting that for any elements1The requirement n > 0 blocks the inference from287s l , .

?, An respectively, sl + ... + Sn isin A.
Thus the relevant prosodic operations are en-coded by the linear ordering of antecedents in thesequent, and structural rules of permutation, con-traction, and weakening are not valid.
The calculusis as follows.
The notation P(A) represents an an-tecedent containing a subpart A.a. ~ .
id  r =~ A A(A) =~ B (2)A =~ A Cuta(r) Bb.
r =~ A A(B) =~ C A, r ==~ B\ L  ~Raf t ,  A\B)  :=~ C r ::~ A \BC.
r =~ A A(B) ==~ C r,  A =~ B?
/L B /A /R  A(B/A,  r )  =~ C rd.
F(A,B) ~ C r ~ A A =~ B?
L .Rr(A.B) ~ C r, A =t~ A .BAs is normal in sequent calculus, each operator hasa L(eft) rule of use and a R(ight) rule of proof.
Cut-free backward chaining proof search is terminatingsince in every proof step going from conclusion topremises, the total number of operator occurrencesis reduced by one.The original development of categorial grammargrew from semantic oncerns, and as is well known,the formalism embraces compositional type-logicalsemantics.
In particular, division categories A\Band B/A can be seen as Fregean functors: incom-plete Bs the meanings of which are abstracted overA argument meanings.
Complete (or: saturated) ex-pressions bearing primary meanings belong to atomiccategories.
Given some basic semantic domains (e.g.truth values {0, 1}, a set of entities E, .
.
. )
a hi-erarchy of spaces for a type-logicai semantics maybe generated by such operations as function forma-tion (r\[2: the set of all functions from r2 into rl)and pair formation (rl x r~: the set of all orderedpairs comprising a rl followed by a r2).
Each cat-egory formula A is associated with a semantic do-main T(A).
Such a type map T for atomic categoryformulas (e.g.
T(N) = E,T(S)  = {0, 1},T(CN) ={0, 1} E) is extended to compound category formulasby T(A\B)  = T(B/A)  = T(B) T(A) and T(A*B) =T(A) x T(B).
Each category formula A is now inter-preted as a set of two dimensional 'signs': a subsetD(A) of L x T(A).
Such an interpretation for atomiccategory formulas is extended to one for compoundA =~ A to =~ A/A which as a theorem would assert hatthe identity element  is a member of each category ofthe form A/A (similarly for A\A).
Since we have definedcategories to be interpreted as subsets of a set L whichdoes not necessarily contain an identity element, such atheorem would not be valid, and it is prevented by defin-ing sequents as having at least one antecedent formula.category formulas by: 2D(A\B)D(B/A)D(A.B)= {(s,m)IV(s',m') e D(A), (3)(s' + m(m')) e D(B)}- -  {(s,m)lV(s',m') e D(A),(, + e, m(m')) e O(B)}=(st, ml) ?
D(A), (s2, ms) ?
D(B)}Proofs can be annotated to associate typed semanticlambda terms with each theorem \[Moortgat, 1988\].A sequent has the form zi:A1,...,xn:An ::~ ?
:Awhere n > 0, no semantic variable is associated withmore than one category formula, and ?
is a typedlambda term over (free) variables {xl,..., x,}.
It isto be read as stating that the result of applying theprosodic operation implicit in the ordering, and thesemantic operation represented explicitly by ?, tothe prosodic and semantic components of any signsin At,..., An yields a sign in A.
This system is un-derstood as observing the type map in the obviousway, and is an instance of the Curry-Howard corre-spondence between (intuitionistic) proofs and typedlambda terms.
It was first employed in relation tocategorial grammar in \[van Benthem~ 1983\]; for gen-eralisation to other connectives see \[Morrill, 1990b;Morrill, 1992a\]2 Prosodic LabellingAs we shall see, the implicit coding of prosodic op-erations in the ordering of a sequent is not expres-sive enough to represent the logic of discontinuityconnectives.
In this connection, \[Moortgat, 1991b\]employs \[Gabbay, 1991\] notion of labelled deductivesystem (LDS).
When we label for prosodics as wellas semantics, a sequent has the form al - zi: At, ...,am - x, :Am ::~ a - ?
: A where n >_ 0, no prosodic orsemantic variable is associated with more than onecategory formula, c~ i s a prosodic term over variables{al,..., an} and ?
is a typed lambda term over (free)variables {zl,..., Zn}.
The prosodically and seman-2A general preparation for such multidimensionalcharacterisation is provided by \[Oehrle, 1988\] which ef-fectively refines Montague's program in order to pro-vide a more even-handed treatment of linguistic dimen-sions.
But note that Oehrle anticipates only functions asprosodic and semantic objects.
Here the prosodic alge-bra is not marie up of functions, and nor are functionsthe only kind of semantic object.
The symmetric treat-ment of prosodies and semantics concurs with the con-temporary trend for 'sign-based' grammatical formalismssuch as HPSG \[Pollard and Sag, 1902\], though this latteronly goes so fax as recursively defining a relation betweenprosodic and semantic forms, i.e.
representations.
By in-terpreting categories in the way set out in \[Morrill, 1992a\]as pairings of prosodic and semantic objects we make di-rect reference to their properties as defined in terms ofmathematical models, and use forms only in the meta-theory.288tically labelled calculus is as follows.

D(B)}As a consequence the following laws hold (see \[Lam-bek, 1958; Lambek, 1988; Dunn, 1991; Moortgat,1991a; Moortgat and Morrill, 1991\]: 4A ::t, C/riB HF- A.nB =~ C Hk B ::V A\nC (6)The LDS logic directly reflects this interpretation.
Italways has the following format, together with labelequations in accordance with the axioms of the alge-bra of interpretation.a.
(7)"ida:A :=~ a:Ab.We are free to manipulate labels according tothe equations they satisfy.
In the case of asso-ciative Lambek calculus there is the assoeiativity c.law; in the case of non-associative Lambek calcu-lus there would be no equations on labels.
Ob-serve that with prosodic labelling, the structuralrules permutation, contraction, and weakening are d.valid.
In our labelling, we maintain the conventionthat antecedent formulas are labelled with prosodicand semantic variables.

Other f.versions of labelling allow labelling antecedent for-mulas with prosodic and semantic terms in general.However such labelling constrains the value of the el-ements to which the theorems apply by reference to g.the terms that represent them.
In relation to gram-mar, this would mean conditioning rules on the se-mantic and/or prosodic form of the input.
For in-stance, with respect o semantics, this would consti- h.tute essential reference to semantic form in the waywhich Montague grammar deliberately avoids.
Weadvocate xactly the same transparency in relation3In prosodic and semantic terms we allow omission ofparenthesis under associativity, and under a conventionthat unary operators bind tighter than binary operators.F =~ a:A a:A,A ::t,/5(a): BCutr,  ~ ~ ~(a): BF::~a:A b:B,A:o7(b):Cr,d:A\nB, a =~ 3"(a +.

deterministic ternaxy relations.289The semantic interpretation with respect o func-tion and Cartesian product formation can also be ap-plied uniformly, with systematic labelling as in theprevious ection.4 D iscont inu i tyElegant as such categorial grammar is, it is moresuggestive of an approach to computational linguis-tic grammar formalism, than actually representa-tive of such.
Amongst he various enrichments thathave been proposed (see e.g.
\[van Benthem, 1989;Morrill et al, 1990; Barry et al, 1991; Morrill, 1990a;Morrill, 1990b; Moortgat and Morrill, 1991; Morrill,1992a; Morrill, 1992b\]), \[Moortgat, 1988\] advancedearlier discussion of discontinuity in e.g.
\[Bach, 1981;Bach, 1984\] with a proposal for infixing and wrap-ping operators.
The operators not only provide scopeover these particular phenomena but also, as indi-cated in e.g.
\[Moortgat, 1990\], seem to provide anunderlying basis in terms of which operators for bind-ing phenomena such as quantification and reflexivisa-tion should be definable.
The coverage of pied pipingin \[Morrill, 1992b\] would also be definable in termsof these primitives, but all this depends on the reso-lution of certain technical issues which have been todate outstanding.Amongst he examples we shall be able to treat bymeans of our present proposals are the following.a.
Mary rang John up.
(8)b. Mary gave John the cold shoulder.c.
John likes everything.d.
for whom John works.e.
John studies logic, and Charles, phonetics.In the particle-verb construction (8a) and discontin-uous idiom (8b), the object 'John' infixes in discon-tinuous expressions with unitary meanings.
In (8c)the quantifier must receive sentential semantic scope,and in (Sd) the pied piping must be generated, withthe semantics of 'whom John works for'.
In (Be), thesemantics of the verb gapped in the second conjunctmust be recovered from the first conjunct.Binary operators T and ~ are proposed in \[Moort-gat, 1988\] such that BTA signifies functors that wraparound their A arguments to form Bs, and BIA sig-nifies functors that infix themselves in their A argu-ments to form Bs.
Assuming the semigroup algebraof associative Lambek calculus, there are two possi-bilities in each case, depending on whether we arefree to insert anywhere (universal), or whether therelevant insertion points are fixed (existential).
Weleave semantics aside for the moment.Existential (9)D(BT~A) = {s\]3sl, s2\[s = Sl + s2 A Vs' ?

D(A), Vsl, s2\[s' = sl + s2 ---* Sl + s' + s2 ?
D(S)\]}Inspecting the possibilities of ordered sequent pre-sentation, of the eight possible rules of inference (useand proof for each of four operators), only TjR andIvL are expressible:a. rl,A,r~ =~ B (11)r l ,  F2 =~ BT~A TJFtb.
El,F2 =?, A A1,B, A2 ::~ CIvLA1, El, BIvA, F2, A2 =?, CThis is the partiM logic of \[Moortgat, 1988\].
Notethat the absence of a rule of use for existential wrap-ping means that we could not generate from discon-tinuous elements uch as ring up and give the coldshoulder which we should like to assign lexical cat-egory (N\S)TsN.
(Evidently Tv would permit incor-rect word order such as *'Mary gave the John coldshoulder'.)
The problem with ordered sequents isthat the implicit encoding of prosodic operations i oflimited expressivity.
Accordingly, \[Moortgat, 1991b\]seeks to improve the situation by means of explicitprosodic labelling.
This does enable both rules fore.g.
~v but still does not enable the useful TjL: theremaining problem is, as noted by \[Versmissen, 1991\],that we need to have an insertion point somehow de-terminate from the prosodic label for an existentialwrapper in order to perform a left inference.In \[Moortgat, 1991a\] a discontinuity product isproposed, again implicitly assuming just a semigroupalgebra: 5D(A ?
B) = {sl + s2 +dl \]Sl + st e D(A), (12)s2 E D(B)}As for the discontinuity divisions, ordered sequentpresentation cannot express rules of both use andproof: only ?R can be represented:r l ,  F2 ::~ A A =~ B (13)'?RF1,A,F2 =~ A?BEven using labelling, the problem for ?L remainsand is the same as that above: there is no propermanagement of separation points.In \[Moortgat, 1991a\] it is observed how thequantifying-in of infix binders such as quantifierSThe version given is actually just the existential caseof two possibilities, existential and universal, as before.No rules for the universal version can be expressed inordered sequent calculus, or labelled sequent calculus.290F ,a -  x:A =:~ 71 +a+72 -?

And if this definability could be main-tained, it would enable these operators to simulatethe account of pied piping in \[Morrill, 1992b\].
Noneof the interpretations above however enable the ex-pression of the requirement that the positions re-ferred to by the two operator occurrences are thesame.
Our proposals will facilitate this definability,and also admit of a full (labelled) logic.5 Tuple Control of Insertion PointsThe present innovation rests on extending theprosodic algebra (L*,+,t) as above to an algebra(L*, +, t, (., .
), 1, 2) where (., .)
is a binary operationof tuple formation (introduced in \[Solias, 1992\]), withrespect o which 1 and 2 behave as projection func-tions.
Thus the algebra satisfies the conditions:l(sl, s2) = sx 2(sl, 82) = 82 (14)(Is, 2s) -" sWe may in particular think of the algebra of elementsV* obtained from disjoint sets V and {\[, ;, \]} by clos-ing V under two binary operations: concatenation+, and pairing \[.
; .\] where pairing can be defined asconcatenation with delimitation and marking of in-sertion point.The proposal can be related to \[Moortgat andMorrill, 1991\] which also considers algebras withmore than one adjunction operation (each either as-sociative or non-associative), and defines divisionsand products with respect to each by residuation.Note however that firstly, our tuple prosodic oper-ation is not simply that of non-associative Lambekcalculus which is characterised by the absence of anyaxiom (associative or otherwise), since the projec-tion axioms entail specific conditions not imposedin the non-associative case: we might describe thetuple system as unassociative.
Tupling is bijectiveand a prosodic object s formed by tupling recordsa separation point between two objects ls and 2swhereas a prosodic object formed by non-associativeadjunction has no such recoverable separation point.Secondly, we are not primarily interested here in di-visions and products based on tupling but in thecombined use of the associative and unassociativeoperations to define discontinuity operators.
(Notehowever that residuation with respect o tupling, asproposed in \[Solias, 1992\], would define operatorssuitable for verbs regarded as head-wrappers suchas 'persuade'.)
This brings us to the essence of thepresent proposals with respect to wrapping and infix-ing.
The prosodic interpretation for the discontinuityoperators is to be as follows:D(BTA) ={s\[Vs' e D(A), ls + s' + 2s e D(B)} (15)D(BIA)  = {siVa' e D(A), ls' + s + 28' G D(B)}D(A ?
B) = {181 + 82 + 282\[81 ?
D(A),82 ?
D(B)}It can be seen that the operators are the residuationdivisions with respect o a binary prosodic opera-tion I defined by szIs2 = 181 + s2 + 281 just as theLambek operators are the residuation divisions withrespect o +.
Use of the tuple operation collapsesthe former distinction between existential and uni-versal in (9) and (10).
Because pairing is bijectiveand tuples express a unique insertion point, there isa unique decomposition of tupled elements.
Exis-tential and universal wrappers collapse into a singlewrapper and existential and universal infixers col-lapse into a single infixer.Turning to include the semantics, the type mapis as is to be expected for functors and for product:T(BTA) = T(BIA)  = T(B) T(A) and T(A @ B) =T(A) x T(B), and as usual a category formula A isinterpreted as a subset of L x T(A).D(BTA) = {(s,m)\[V(s',m') ?
D(A), (16)(ls + 8' + 2s, m(m')) ?
D(S)}D(B~A) = {(s, rn)\]V(s',rn') ?
D(A),(Is' + s + 28', m(m')) ?
D(B)}D(A?B)  = {( lS l+S2+2sl , (ml ,m2)) \ [(sl, rnl) ?
D(A), (s2, m2) ?
D(B)}The full prosodically and semantically abelled logicis given in Figure 1.
In TL lc and 2c pick out thefirst and second projections of the prosodic object cin the same way that projections pick out the com-ponents of a semantic object in the eL rule of (4g);291likewise in ~l~ for the projections la and 2a.
Theresulting prosodic forms are only simplifiable whenthe relevant objects are tuples.
66 D iscont inu i ty  Examples6.1 Phrasal  VerbsAs a first example of discontinuity consider the parti-cle verb case 'Mary rang John up' and the discontin-uous idiom case 'Mary gave John the cold shoulder'.The meaning of the particle verb and the phrasal id-iom resides with its elements together, which wraparound their object.
The lexical assignments re-quired are:(rang, up) - r ing-up (17):= (N\S)TN(gave, the + cold + shoulder) - give-tes:= (N\S)TNA derivation is given in Figure 2.
The lexical prosod-ies and semantics of the proper names may be as-sumed to be atoms.
For 'Mary rang John up', substi-tution of the lexical prosodies thus yields (18) whichsimplifies as shown.Mary + 1(rang, up) + John + 2(rang, up)Mary -t- rang + John + up(18)Similarly, substitution of the lexical semantics gives(19).
((ring-up john) mary) (19)For 'Mary gave John the cold shoulder', substitutionof the lexical prosodies yields:Mary + l(gave, the + cold + shoulder) q- John+ 2(gave, the + cold + shoulder) .,zMary + gave + John + the + cold + shoulder(20)The semantics i :((gave-tcs john) mary) (21)?Having the projection functions defined for allprosodic objects rather then just tuple objects allowsus to consider the prosodic algebra to be untyped (or:unsorted).
Consequently, there is no need to check forthe data type of prosodic objects such as by pattern-matching on antecedent terms (see comment above ontransparency ofrules).
It may be possible to develop thepresent proposals by adding sort structure to the prosodicalgebra in a manner analogous to the typing of the seman-tic algebra.
Such sorting could be essential to defininga model theory with respect o which the calculus canbe shown to be complete.
Recursive nesting of infixationpoints does not appear to be motivated linguistically, andthe present calculus does not support it.
A sorted modeltheory which excludes the recursion might provide an in-terpretation with respect to which the present calculus isboth sound and complete.6.2 Quantif ier RaisingIn Montague grammar quantifying-in s motivatedby the necessity to achieve sentential scope forall quantifiers and quantifier-scope ambiguities.Quantifying-in allows a quantifier phrase to ap-ply as a semantic functor to its sentential context.Quantifying-in at different sentence levels enablesa quantifier to take scope accordingly, and alterna-tive orderings of quantifying-in enable quantifiers totake different scopings relative to one another.
In\[Moortgat, 1990\] a binary operator ~ is defined forwhich the rule of use is essentially quantifying-in, sothat a Montagovian treatment of quantifier-scopingis achieved by assignment of a quantifier phrase like'something' to N~S, and assignment of determinerslike 'every' to (N~S)/CN.
In \[Moortgat, 1991a\] hesuggests that a category such as A ~ B might be de-finable as B~(BTA), but notes that this definabilitydoes not hold for his definitions, for which, further-more, the logic is problematic.
On the present formu-lation however, these intuitions are realised.
The cat-egory S~(STN) is a suitable category for a quantifierphrase such as 'everything' or 'some man', achiev-ing sentential quantifier scope, and quantificationalambiguity.Assume the lexical entry (22).everything - XzVy(x y) := SI(SI"N) (22)For 'John likes everything' there is the derivation inFigure 3.
In this derivation, and in general, ines areincluded showing explicit label manipulations underequality in the prosodic algebra, in such a way thatall rule instances match the rule presentations.
Sub-stitution of the lexical prosodies and semantics as-sociates John + likes + everything with (23) whichsimplifies as shown.
(AzVy(x y) Ac((like c) john)) --* (23)Vy((like y) john)In this example the' quantifier is peripheral in thesentence and a category (S/N)\S could have beenused in associative Lambek calculus.
However, an-other category S/(N\S) would be needed to allow thequantifier phrase to appear in subject position, andfurther assignments still would be required for post-verbal position in a ditransitive verb phrase, andso on.
Some generality can be achieved by assum-ing second-order polymorphie categories ( ee \[Emms,1990\]), but note that the single assignment we havegiven allows appearance in all N positions withoutfurther ado, and allows all the relative quantifierscopings at S nodes.6.3 Pied PipingIn \[Moortgat, 1991a\] and and \[Morrill, 19925\] athree-place operator is considered which is like AB, except hat quantifying-in changes the category ofthe context expression.. \[Morrill, 1992b\] shows thatthis enables capture of pied piping.

As a result, the treatment of \[Morrill, 1992b\]can be presented in these terms.Consider the example 'for whom John works'.
Therelative pronoun is lexically assigned as follows whereR is the common oun modifier category CN\CN.whom - w) ^  (u (x (24):-- (R/(STPP))~(PPTN)There is the derivation in Figure 4.
The result ofprosodic substitution isfor + whom + 0'ohn + works, t) (25)The result of semantic substitution is((A~AYAzAwC(z w) ^  (Y (x w))\] (26)As(for a)) Ah((work h) john)) -,~AzAw\[(z w) A ((work (for w)) john)\]As for the quantification, this example is potentiallymanageable in just Lambek calculus.
But an exam-ple where the relative pronoun is not peripheral inthe pied piped material, such as 'a man a brother ofwhom from Brazil appeared on television' would beproblematic for the same reasons as quantification.The solution, in terms of infixing and wrapping, isthe same in the two cases, but pied piping has beena more conspicuous problem for categorial grammarbecause while the scoping of quantifiers can be playeddown, the syntactic realisation of pied piping is onlytoo evident.
In the phrase structure tradition, piedpiping has been taken as strong motivation for fea-ture percolation (see \[Pollard, 1988\]).
We have seenhere how discontinuity operators challenge this con-strual.Categorial grammar is well-known to provideOSSibilities for 'non-constituent' coordination (seeteedman, 1985; Dowty, 1988J) less accessible in thephrase structure/feature p rcolation approach.
Weturn now to another example which is glaringly prob-lematic for all approaches, gapping.
It is entirelyunclear how feature percolation could engage such aconstruction; but as we shall see the discontinuityapparatus ucceeds in doing so.7 GappingThe kind of examples we want to consider are:John studies logic, and Charles, phonetics.
(27)The construction is characterised by the absencein the right hand conjunct of a verbal element,the understood semantics of which is provided bya corresponding verbal element in the left handconjunct.
Clearly, instanciations of a coordinatorcategory schema (X\X)/X will not generate suchcases of gapping.
The phenomenon has attracted afair amount of attention in categorial grammar (e.g.\[Steedman, 1990; Raaijmakers, 1991\]).The approach of \[Steedman, 1990\] aims to reducegapping to constituent coordination; furthermore itaims to do this using just the standard ivision op-erators of categorial grammar.
This involves pecialtreatment of both the right and the left conjunct.
Wepresent our discussion in the context of the presentminimal example of gapping a transitive verb TV.With respect to the right hand conjunct, the initialproblem is to give a categorisation at all.
Steedmandoes this by reference to a constituent formed bythe subject and object with the coordinator.
Thisconstituent is essentially TV\S but with a feature293a-a:N =~a-a:N c-c:PP =~c-c:PP/Lf-f:PP/N, a-a:N ~f+a-(fa):PPf-f:PP/N, a-a:N =~f+a+t-(fa):PP-Trtf-f:PP/N =~(f,t)-~a(fa):PPTNj-j:N =~j-j:N k-k:S =~k-k:S\Lh-h:PP =~h-h:PP j-j:N, i-i:N\S =~j+i-(ij):Sj-j:N, w-w:(N\S)/PP, h-h:PP =~j+w+h-((wh)j):S/Lj-j:N, w-w:(N\S)/PP, h-h: PP =~j+w+h+t-((wh)j):STRj-j:N, w-w:(N\S)/PP =?,(j+w, t)-),h((wh)j):STPP g-g:R =~g-g:R/Ld-d:R/(STPP), j-j:N, w-w:(N\S)/PP =~d+(j+w,t)-(d),h((wh)j)):RILf-f:PP/N, o-o:(R/(SI"PP))I(PPTN), j-j:N, w-w:(N\S)/PP =~f+o+t+(j+w,t)-((o~a(fa))~h((wh)j)):Rmf-f:PP/N, o-o:(R/(STPP))I(PPTN), j-j:N, w-w:(N\S)/PP =~f+o+(j+w,t)-((o),a(fa)))~h((wh)j)):RFigure 4: Derivation for 'for whom John works'both blocking ordinary application, and licensing co-ordination with a left hand conjunct of the samecategory.
The blocking is necessary because 'andCharles, phonetics' is clearly not of category TV\S:'Studies and Charles, phonetics' is not a sentence.Now, with respect o the left hand conjunct, Steed-man invokes a special decomposition of 'John stud-ies logic' analysed as S, into TV and TV\S.
Thereis then constituent coordination between TV\S andTV\S.
Finally the coordinate structure of categoryTV\S combines with TV on the left to give S.Although this treatment addresses the two prob-lems that any account of gapping must solve, cate-gorisation of the right hand conjunct and access ofthe verbal semantics in the left hand conjunct, it at-tempts to do so within a narrow conception of cate-gorial grammar (only division operators) that neces-siates invocation of distinctly contrived mechanisms.We believe that the radical reconstruals of grammarimplicated by this analysis are not necessary giventhe general framework including discontinuity oper-ators we have set out.
We address for the momentjust our minimal example.Within the context of categorial grammar we haveestablished, the right hand conjunct is characteris-able as STTV.
It remains to access the understoodverbal semantics from the sentence that is the lefthand conjunct.
In order to recover from the lefthand side the information we miss on the right handside, we would like to say that this information,the category and semantics of the verb, is madeavailable to the coordinator when it combines withthe left conjunct.
In accordance with the spirit ofSteedman, we can observe that the left hand con-junct contains a part with the category SI"TV of theright hand constituent, but it is discontinuous, be-ing interpolated by TV.
But this is precisely whatis expressed by the discontinuous product category(STTV)?TV.
Furthermore, an element of such a cat-egory has as its semantics a pair the second pro-jection of which is the semantics of the TV.
Conse-quently gapping is generated by assignment of 'and'to the category (((STTV)?TV)\S)/(STTV) with se-mantics ~x~y\[(rly r2y) A (x 7r2y)\].The complete derivation for (27) is as in Figure 5,where TV abbreviates (N\S)/N.
When we substitutethe lexical prosodics (here each just a prosodic con-stant) for the prosodic variables in the conclusion,we obtain the prosodic form (28).John + studies + logic + and (28)+ ( Charles, phonetics)Similarly substituting the lexical semantics (all se-mantic constants except for the coordinator seman-tics as above), we obtain the associated semantics(29) which evaluates as shown.^ (29)Aw((w phonetics) charles))(As((s logic) john), studies)) -,~\[((studies logic) john)A((studies phonetics) charles)\]Some generalisation to cover different categoriesof gapped element and different categories of coor-dination is given by straightforward schematisation.In general, gapping coordinator categories have theform ((Z ?
Y) \X) /Z  where Z is XTY.
In thisscheme, X is the category of the resulting coordinatestructure and Y is the category of the gapped mate-riM.
This allows interaction with other coordinationphenomena such as node raising.
For example, areferee pointed out that gapping can occur withinincomplete sentences thus: 'John gave a book andPeter, a paper, to Mary'.
Such a case would be cov-ered by the instanciation where Y is the ditransitiveverb category and X is S/PP.For generalisation i cluding multiple gapping (sev-eral discontinuous segments elided) see \[Solids, 1992\],which employs in addition operators formed by resid-uation with respect o tupling.
That approach ascertain affinities with \[Oehrle, 1987\], and makes itpossible to begin to address examples of Oehrle's re-lating to scope and Boolean particles.

tinuity.8 ConclusionWhen \[Moortgat, 1988\] introduced iscontinuity op-erators for categorial grammar, he noted that or-dered sequent calculus was an inadequate mediumfor the representation f a full logic.
In \[Moortgat,1991b\] the LDS formalism was invoked, but as wehave seen, the LDS format alone is not enough.
Thepresent paper has argued that a different view is re-quired on the model theory of discontinuity han thatsuggested by interpretation i  just a semigroup alge-bra.
This view is provided by adding to the algebraof interpretation the tuple operation of \[Solias, 1992\].Not only does this clear up some vagueness with re-spect o existential nd universal formulations, it alsoadmits of a full labelled logic.
This has brought us toa stage where it is appropriate to address uch issuesas completeness and Cut-elimination.AcknowledgementsWe thank the following for comment on an earlier ab-stract: Juan Barba, Alain Lecomte, Michael Moort-gut, Koen Versmissen, and three anonymous EACLreviewers.
