CurranSchool of ITUniversity of SydneyNSW 2006, Australiajames@it.usyd.edu.auAbstractAt present, most biomedical InformationRetrieval and Extraction tools process ab-stracts rather than full-text articles.
The in-creasing availability of full text will allowmore knowledge to be extracted with greaterreliability.
To investigate the challenges offull-text processing, we manually annotateda corpus of cited articles from a MolecularInteraction Map (Kohn, 1999).Our analysis demonstrates the necessity offull-text processing; identifies the articlesections where interactions are most com-monly stated; and quantifies both the amountof external knowledge required and the pro-portion of interactions requiring multiple ordeeper inference steps.
Further, it identi-fies a range of NLP tools required, including:identifying synonyms, and resolving coref-erence and negated expressions.
This is im-portant guidance for researchers engineeringbiomedical text processing systems.1 IntroductionIt is no longer feasible for biologists to keep abreastof the vast quantity of biomedical literature.
Evenkeyword-based Information Retrieval (IR) over ab-stracts retrieves too many articles to be individuallyinspected.
There is considerable interest in NLP sys-tems that overcome this information bottleneck.Most bioNLP systems have been applied to ab-stracts only, due to their availability (Hirschman etal., 2002).
Unfortunately, the information in ab-stracts is dense but limited.
Full-text articles havethe advantage of providing more information andrepeating facts in different contexts, increasing thelikelihood of an imperfect system identifying them.Full text contains explicit structure, e.g.
sectionsand captions, which can be exploited to improveInformation Extraction (IE) (Regev et al, 2002).Previous work has investigated the importance ofextracting information from specific sections, e.g.Schuemie et al (2004), but there has been little anal-ysis of when the entire document is needed for accu-rate knowledge extraction.
For instance, extractinga fact from the Results may require a synonym to beresolved that is only mentioned in the Introduction.External domain knowledge may also be required.We investigated these issues by manually anno-tating full-text passages that describe the functionalrelationships between bio-entities summarised in aMolecular Interaction Map (MIM).
Our corpustracks the process Kohn (1999) followed in sum-marising interactions for the mammalian cell MIM,by identifying information required to infer facts,which we call dependencies.
We replicate the pro-cess of manual curation and demonstrate the neces-sity of full-text processing for fact extraction.In the same annotation process we have identi-fied NLP problems in these passages which must besolved to identify the facts correctly including: syn-onym and hyponym substitution, coreference reso-lution, negation handling, and the incorporation ofknowledge from within the full text and the domain.This allows us to report on the relative importanceof anaphora resolution and other tasks to the prob-lem of biomedical fact extraction.As well as serving as a dataset for future tool de-velopment, our corpus is an excellent case study pro-viding valuable guidance to developers of biomedi-cal text mining and retrieval systems.171Figure 1: Map A of the Molecular Interaction Map compiled by Kohn (1999)2 Biomedical NLPFull-text articles are becoming increasingly avail-able to NLP researchers, who have begun inves-tigating how specific sections and structures canbe mined in various information extraction tasks.Regev et al (2002) developed the first bioIR sys-tem specifically focusing on limited text sections.Their performance in the KDD Cup Challenge, pri-marily using Figure legends, showed the importanceof considering document structure.
Yu et al (2002)showed that the Introduction defines the majority ofsynonyms, while Schuemie et al (2004) and Shah etal.
(2003) showed that the Results and Methods arethe most and least informative, respectively.
In con-trast, Sinclair and Webber (2004) found the Methodsuseful in assigning Gene Ontology codes to articles.These section specific results highlight the infor-mation loss resulting from restricting searches to in-dividual sections, as sections often provide uniqueinformation.
Furthermore, facts appearing in dif-ferent contexts across various sections, will be lost.This redundancy has been used for passage valida-tion and ranking (Clarke et al, 2001).There are limited training resources for biomedi-cal full-text systems.
The majority of corpora con-sist of abstracts annotated for bio-entity recognitionand Relationship Extraction, such as the GENIA(Kim et al, 2003) and the BioCreAtIvE corpora.However, due to the lack of full-text corpora, manycurrent systems only process abstracts (Ohta et al,2006).
Few biomedical corpora exist for other tasks,such as coreference resolution (Castan?o et al, 2004;Vlachos et al, 2006), and these are very small.
Inthis paper, we estimate the importance of these tasksin bioNLP systems, which will help determine whichtasks system developers should focus effort on first.Despite limited full-text training corpora, compe-titions such as the Genomics track of TREC, requiresystems to retrieve and rank passages from full textthat are relevant to question style queries.3 Molecular Interaction MapsKohn (1999) constructed a Molecular InteractionMap (MIM) based on literature describing 203 dif-ferent interactions between bio-entities, such as pro-teins and genes, in mammalian cells (Figure 1).
In-teractions in the MIM are represented as links be-tween nodes labelled with the bio-entities.
Each linkis associated with a description that summarises theevidence for the interaction from the literature, in-cluding citations.
For example, Table 1 containsthe description passage for interaction M4 (on theright of the Myc Box at grid reference C10 in Fig-ure 1).
Although MIM interactions may be men-tioned in other articles, the articles cited by Kohn(1999) document the main biomedical research lead-ing to the discovery of these interactions.172c-Myc and pRb enhance transcription from the E-cadherin promoter in an AP2-dependent manner in epithelial cells (mechanismunknown) (Batsche et al, 1998).
Activation by pRb and c-Myc is not additive, suggesting that they act upon the same site,thereby perhaps blocking the binding of an unidentified inhibitor.
No c-Myc recognition element is required for activation ofthe E-cadherin promoter by c-Myc.
Max blocks transcriptional activation from the E-cadherin promoter by c-Myc, presumablybecause it blocks the binding between c-Myc and AP2.Table 1: MIM annotation M41.
M4 Subfact: Activation of E-cadherin by pRb and c-Myc is not additive, suggesting they act on thesame sitea) However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which RB, Myc, and AP-2 cooperate to effect transcriptional activation ofE-cadherin requires further study.

(Intro)Table 2: Example instances depending on synonym factsIn creating our corpus we have attempted to re-verse engineer and document the MIM creation pro-cess for many of the interactions in Kohn (1999).
Weexhaustively traced and documented the process ofidentifying passages from the cited full-text articlesthat substantiate the MIM interactions.
This allowsus to identify and quantify the amount of informa-tion that is unavailable when systems are restrictedto abstracts.4 Corpus CreationThe first stage of corpus creation involved obtainingthe full text of the articles cited in the MIM descrip-tions.
There are 262 articles cited in Kohn (1999),and we have manually extracted the text from 218 ofthem; we have abstracts for the other 44 which havenot been included in the analysis presented here.Currently, the annotated part of the corpus con-sists of passages from 101 full-text articles, support-ing 95 of the 203 MIM descriptions.
A biomedi-cal expert exhaustively identified these passages bymanually reading each article several times.
30% ofthese articles support multiple MIM descriptions andso passages from these articles may appear multipletimes.
We restricted the corpus to the cited articlesonly.
This allows us to quantify the need for externalresources, e.g.
synonym lists and ontologies.
Thecorpus collection involved the following:1.
Each sentence in a MIM description is a calleda main fact.2.
For each main fact we annotated every passage(instance) that the fact can be derived from.These include direct statements of the fact andpassages the fact can be implied from.3.
Main facts are often complex sentences, com-bining numerous facts from the article.
Pas-sages from which part of a fact can be de-rived are also annotated as instances.
A subfactis then created to represent these partial facts.This may be repeated for subfacts.4.
Many instances cannot be directly linked totheir corresponding fact, as they depend on ad-ditional passages within the full text or exter-nal domain knowledge.
New facts are formedto represent the dependency information ?
syn-onym and extra facts.
Instances of these are an-notated, and a link is added between the origi-nal and dependency facts.5.
Each instance is annotated with its locationwithin the article.
Linguistic phenomena, in-cluding anaphora, cataphora, and negated ex-pressions which must be resolved to derive thefact are identified.Tables 1 and 2 show an example of this pro-cess.
One of the main facts of interaction M4 (Ta-ble 1) is Activation by pRb and c-Myc is not additive.

blocking the binding of an unidentified inhibitor.An instance supporting part of this fact, the subfactin Table 2 Activation of E-cadherin by pRb and c-Myc is not additive .

, 1.a), was identified.
This in-stance requires the resolution of two synonymy de-pendencies, only one of which appears in the article.1732.
E13 Main Fact: HDAC1 binds to the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and p130 and in turn is recruited toE2F complexes on promotersa) The experiments described above indicate that p107 and p130 can interact with HDAC1.
We thus reasoned that they couldrepress E2F activity by recruiting histone deacetylase activity to E2F containing promoters.
(Results)Extra: HDAC1 is a histone deacetylaseb) We have previously shown that Rb, the founding member of the pocket proteins family, represses E2F1 activity by recruitingthe histone deacetylase HDAC1.
(Abstract)Table 3: Example instances depending on extra facts3.
N4 Main fact: RPA2 binds XPA via the C-terminal region of RPA2Mutant RPA that lacked the p34 C terminus failed to interact with XPA, whereas RPA containing the p70 mutant (Delta RS)interacted with XPA (Fig.
2).
(Results)4.
C9 Subfact: Cyclin D1 degraded rapidly by phosphorylation at threonine-286Although ?free?
or CDK4-bound cyclin D1 molecules are intrinsically unstable (t1/2< 30 min), a cyclin D1 mutant (T286A)containing an alanine for threonine-286 substitution fails to undergo efficient polyubiquitination in an in vitro system or invivo, and it is markedly stabilized (t1/2 approximately 3.5 hr) when inducibly expressed in either quiescent or proliferatingmouse fibroblasts.
(Abstract)Table 4: Example instances with negated expressions5 DependenciesIn our corpus, an instance of a fact may depend onadditional facts (dependencies) to allow the fact tobe derived from the original instance.
Dependenciesmay occur elsewhere in the document or may not bementioned at all.
We consider two types of depen-dencies: synonym facts and extra facts.5.1 Synonym FactsThe frequent use of synonyms, abbreviations andacronyms in biomedical text is a common sourceof ambiguity that is often hard to resolve (Sehgalet al, 2004).
Furthermore, synonym lists are dif-ficult to maintain in rapidly moving fields like bi-ology (Lussier et al, 2006).
There has been recentinterest in developing systems to identify and extractthese (Ao and Takagi, 2005; Okazaki and Anani-adou, 2006).In our corpus we group all of these synonyms, ab-breviations, acronyms and other orthographic varia-tions as synonym facts.
For example, the synonyms(1) E2F4, (2) E2F-4 and (3) E2F1-4 in our cor-pus refer to the same entity E2F4, however term (3)also includes the entities E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3.In Table 2, an instance supporting subfact 1. isshown in 1.a).
The bio-entity pRb mentioned in thesubfact does not appear in this instance.
Thus 1.a)depends on knowing that pRb is equivalent to RB,and so we form a new synonym fact.
This synonymis undefined in the article and cannot be assumed asRB is also a homograph for the gene ruby (rb), ru-bidium (Rb) and Robertsonian (Rb) translocations.Instance 1 also depends on a second synonym ?c-Myc and Myc are used interchangeably, wherethe protein Myc is referred to by its gene name,c-Myc.
Metonymy is common in biology, and aninstance supporting this synonym fact was found inthe article, 1.b).5.2 Extra FactsExtra facts include all assertions (excluding syn-onym definitions) which are necessary to make avalid inference from an instance to a fact or subfact.These extra facts must be found within the same ar-ticle.
Many extra facts are descriptions or classesof bio-entities and hyponym relationships.
Accord-ing to Ne?dellec et al (2006), a clearer distinc-tion between entities and their classes/descriptionsis needed in bioNLP corpora.Example 2 in Table 3 is an instance which de-pends on an extra fact, 2.b), to derive the main fact.The class of proteins histone deacetylasein sentence 2 must be linked to the specific pro-tein HDAC1 in sentence 1, since the sortal anaphorthey in sentence 2 refers to the antecedents p107and p130, and does not include HDAC1.
This extrafact is identified in the apposition the histonedeacetylase HDAC1 in instance 2.b).1745.
C11b Subfact: p19ARF induces cell cycle arrest in a p53-dependent mannerINK4a/ARF is perhaps the second most commonly disrupted locus in cancer cells.
It encodes two distinct tumorsuppressor proteins: p16INK4a, which inhibits the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein by cyclin D-dependent kinases, and p19ARF, which stabilizes and activates p53 to promote either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
(Intro)6.
C36 Main fact: Cdc25C is phosphorylated by Cyclin B-cdk1In this work, we examine the effect of phosphorylation on the human cdc25-C protein (Sadhu et al,1990).
We show that thisprotein is phosphorylated during mitosis in human cells and that this requires active cdc2-cyclin B.
(Intro)Table 5: Example instances with cataphora and event anaphora6 Negated ExpressionsTo quantify the importance of lexical and logicalnegations we have annotated each instance involv-ing one or more negated expressions that must beresolved to derive the fact.
In biomedical literature,negated expressions are commonly used to describean abnormal condition, such as a mutation, and itsresulting abnormal outcome, such as cancer, fromwhich the normal condition and outcome can be in-ferred.
This typically requires two or more negatedexpressions to be processed simultaneously.Table 4 shows examples of instances with negatedexpressions.
In the subject NP of instance 3, the lex-ical negative form of RPA (Mutant RPA) is fol-lowed directly by a logical negative detailing thefunction it failed to perform.
These two negative ex-pressions support the positive in the main fact.
Thisimplicit reporting of results expressed in terms ofnegative experimental outcomes is very common inmolecular biology and genetics.Example 4 requires external domain knowl-edge.
Firstly, the amino acid alanine cannotbe phosphorylated like threonine.
Secondly,polyubiquitination triggers a signal for aprotein (cyclin D1) to be degraded.
Thereforefrom this negated pair the positive fact from interac-tion C9 can be inferred.The context surrounding potential negative ex-pressions must be analysed to determine if it is in-deed a negative.
For example, not all mutations re-sult in negative outcomes ?
the mutation of p70 ininstance 3 did not have a negative outcome.7 Coreference ExpressionsIn biomedical literature, coreference expressions areused to make abbreviated or indirect references tobio-entities or events, and to provide additional in-formation, such as more detailed descriptions.To quantify the importance of coreference expres-sions, instances in our corpus are annotated withpronominal, sortal and event anaphoric, and cat-aphoric expressions, including those extending be-yond one sentence.
Instances 4?6 in Tables 4?5, each contain annotated pronominal or sortalanaphoric expressions.
Instance 5 also involvesa cataphoric expression, where suppressorproteins refers to p16INK4a and p19ARFEvent anaphora refer to processes and are quitecommon in biomedical text.
We have annotatedthese separately to pronominal and sortal anaphora.Our event anaphora annotations are different toHumphreys et al (1997).
They associate sequentialevents, while we only refer to the same event.An example is shown in instance 6 (Table 5)where the additional sortal anaphor complicates re-solving the event anaphor.
The third this refersto the phosphorylation event, phosphorylated,and not the protein cdc25-C like the second this.8 Locating FactsThe key facts and results are generally repeated andreworded in various contexts within an article.
Thisredundancy can be used in two ways to improve sys-tem precision and recall.
Firstly, the redundancy in-creases the chance of an imperfect system identify-ing at least one instance.
Secondly, the redundancycan be used for fact validation.
By annotating everyinstance that supports a fact we are able to measurethe degree of factual redundancy in full-text articles.We have also annotated each instance with its lo-cation within the article: which section (or structuresuch as a title, heading or caption) it was containedwithin and the number of the paragraph.
Using thisdata, we can evaluate the informativeness of eachsection and structure for identifying interactions.Using our detailed dependency annotations wecan also determine how many instances need addi-175Location Main Fact Subfact Synonym ExtraTitle 3.3 ( 0.2) 1.9 ( 0.7) 0.0 ( 0.0) 0.8 ( 0.8)Abstract 19.1 (10.1) 9.3 ( 5.1) 36.2 (21.7) 25.8 (14.8)Introduction 11.3 ( 5.2) 8.3 ( 3.4) 30.4 (17.4) 17.2 ( 7.8)Results 31.0 (13.8) 37.6 (16.1) 20.3 (15.9) 32.0 (12.5)Discussion 21.8 ( 7.3) 19.5 ( 6.6) 2.9 ( 1.4) 9.4 ( 3.1)Figure Heading 5.0 ( 0.6) 10.7 ( 3.8) 1.4 ( 1.4) 2.3 ( 0.0)Figure Legend 3.1 ( 1.3) 4.8 ( 2.0) 0.0 ( 0.0) 7.0 ( 4.7)Table Data 0.0 ( 0.0) 0.2 ( 0.0) 0.0 ( 0.0) 0.0 ( 0.0)Methods 0.2 ( 0.0) 0.1 ( 0.1) 0.0 ( 0.0) 4.7 ( 0.8)Conclusion 0.6 ( 0.4) 0.1 ( 0.0) 0.0 ( 0.0) 0.0 ( 0.0)Footnotes 0.0 ( 0.0) 0.0 ( 0.0) 5.8 ( 2.9) 0.0 ( 0.0)Headings 4.8 ( 0.6) 7.5 ( 2.7) 2.9 ( 1.4) 0.8 ( 0.8)Full-text 100.0 (39.4) 100.0 (40.6) 100.0 (62.3) 100.0 (45.3)Table 6: Instances found excluding (including) all dependenciesFact Type # Created # Found # InstancesMain Fact 170 156 523Subfact 251 251 1196Synonym 155 62 69Extra 152 87 128Total 728 556 1916Table 7: Distribution of fact types in corpustional knowledge outside of the current section tosupport a particular fact.
This demonstrates how im-portant full-text processing is.9 Corpus AnalysisHaving described the corpus annotation we can nowinvestigate various statistical properties of the data.Table 7 shows the distribution of the various anno-tated fact types within the corpus.
There are a to-tal of 728 different facts identified, with 556 (76%)found within the documents.
We have annotated1916 individual passages as instances, totally 2429sentences.
There were 14 main facts that we foundno instances or subfact instances for.The most redundancy occurs in main facts andsubfacts, with on average 3.35 and 4.76 instanceseach respectively, whilst synonym facts have almostno redundancy.
Also, a large proportion of synonymand extra facts, 60% and 43% respectively, do notappear anywhere in the articles (Table 7).This high level of redundancy in facts demon-strates the significant advantages of processing fulltext.
However, the proportion of missing synonymInstances Synonym ExtraMain Fact 46.8 (10.9) 26.2 (18.9)Subfact 36.9 ( 8.2) 26.7 (15.4)Synonym 8.7 ( 2.9) 7.2 ( 4.3)Extra 25.0 ( 0.0) 13.3 (10.9)Table 8: Instances with (all found) dependenciesand extra facts shows the importance of external re-sources, such as synonym lists, and tools for recog-nising orthographic variants.9.1 Locating FactsTable 6 shows the percentage of instances identifiedin particular locations within the articles.
The bestsections for finding instances of facts and subfactswere the Results and Discussion sections, whereassynonym and extra facts were best found in the Ab-stract, Introduction and Results.
The later sectionsof each article rarely contributed any instances.
In-terestingly, we did not find the Figure headings orlegends to be that informative for main facts.
Figureheadings are restricted in length and thus are rarelyable to express main facts as well as subfacts.The proportion of main facts and subfact in-stances found in the abstract is quite small, furtherdemonstrating the value of full-text processing.If we take into account the additional dependencyinformation, and restrict the instances to those fullysupported within a given section, the results dropdramatically (those in parentheses in Table 6).
In176Depth Fact Subfact Synonym Extra0 35.2 45.1 87.0 64.81 53.9 44.2 13.0 26.62 9.6 9.5 0.0 7.03 1.3 0.9 0.0 1.64 0.0 0.3 0.0 0.0Table 9: Maximum depth of instance dependenciesBreadth Fact Subfact Synonym Extra0 35.2 45.1 87.0 64.81 36.5 35.5 7.2 29.72 22.6 15.7 5.8 4.73 4.6 2.9 0.0 0.84 0.8 0.6 0.0 0.05 0.2 0.2 0.0 0.0Table 10: Breadth of instance dependenciestotal, the number of instances drops to 39.4% and40.6%, for main facts and subfacts, respectively.This again demonstrates the need for full-text pro-cessing, including the dependencies between factsfound in different sections of the article.9.2 DependenciesOur corpus represents each of the facts and subfactsas a dependency graph of instances, each which inturn may require support from other facts, includingsynonym and extra facts.Table 8 shows the percentage of instances whichdepend on synonym and extra facts in our corpus.46.8% of main fact instances depend on at least onesynonym fact, but only 10.9% of main fact instanceswhich depend on at least one synonym were com-pletely resolved (i.e.
all of the synonyms were foundas well).
Interestingly, synonym and extra facts of-ten required other synonym and extra facts.Our corpus contains more synonym than extra factdependencies, however more extra facts were de-fined in the articles.
The large proportion of mainfacts and subfacts depending on synonyms and extrafacts demonstrates the importance of automaticallyextracting this information from full text.Since the inference from an instance to a fact maydepend on other facts, long chains of dependenciesmay occur, all of which would need to be resolvedbefore a main fact could be derived from the text.Expressions InstancesNegated 4.3Anaphora 13.2Event Anaphora 6.6Cataphora 2.7Table 11: Distribution of annotated expressionsTable 9 shows the distribution of maximum chaindepth in our dependency graphs.
The maximumdepth is predominately less than 3.
Table 10 showsthe distribution of the breadth of dependency graphs.Again, most instances are supported by fewer than 3dependency chains.
Most instances depend on someother information, but luckily, a large proportion ofthose only require information from a small numberof other facts.
However, given that these facts couldoccur anywhere within the full text, extracting themis still a very challenging task.9.3 Negated & Coreference ExpressionsTable 11 shows the percentage of instances anno-tated with negated, anaphoric and cataphoric ex-pressions in our corpus.
We have separated eventanaphora from pronominal and sortal anaphora.There are fewer cataphoric and negated expressionsthan anaphoric expressions.
Therefore, we wouldexpect the greatest improvement when systems in-corporate anaphora resolution components, and lit-tle improvement from cataphoric and negated ex-pression analysis.
However, negated expressionsprovide valuable information regarding experimen-tal conditions and outcomes, and thus may be ap-propriate for specific extraction tasks.10 ConclusionThis paper describes a corpus documenting the man-ual identification of facts from full-text articles bybiomedical researchers.
The corpus consists of arti-cles cited in a Molecular Interaction Map developedby Kohn (1999).
Each fact can be derived from oneor more passages from the citations.
Each of theseinstances was annotated with their location in thearticle and whether they contained coreference ornegated expressions.
Each instance was also linkedwith other information, including synonyms and ex-tra knowledge, that was required to derive the partic-ular interaction.
The annotation task was quite com-177plex and as future work we will increase the relia-bility of our corpus by including the annotations ofother domain experts using our guidelines, and usethis resource for tool development.
The guidelinesand corpus will be made publicly available.Our corpus analysis demonstrates that full-textanalysis is crucial for exploiting biomedical litera-ture.
Less than 20% of fact instances we identifiedwere contained in the abstract.
Analysing sectionsin isolation reduced the number of supported factsby 60%.
We also showed that many instances weredependent on a significant amount of other informa-tion, both within and outside the article.
Finally, weshowed the potential impact of various NLP compo-nents such as anaphora resolution systems.This work provides important empirical guidancefor developers of biomedical text mining systems.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the CSIRO ICT Cen-tre and ARC Discovery grants DP0453131 andDP0665973.ReferencesHiroko Ao and Toshihisa Takagi.
