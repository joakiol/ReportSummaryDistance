Chomsky has famously argued that this is a flawed hypothesis, because of the existence ofsuch phenomena as ambiguity.
Furthermore, he argues that the kinds of things that people tend to sayare not short and simple, as would be predicted by communication theory.
Contrary to Chomsky, mygroup applies information theory and communication theory from Shannon (1948) in order to attemptto explain the typical usage of language in comprehension and production, together with the structureof languages themselves.
First, we show that ambiguity out of context is not only not a problem for aninformation-theoretic approach to language, it is a feature.
Second, we show that language comprehen-sion appears to function as a noisy channel process, in line with communication theory.
Given si, theintended sentence, and sp, the perceived sentence we propose that people maximize P (si|sp), which isequivalent to maximizing the product of the prior P (si) and the likely noise processes P (si?
sp).We show that several predictions of this way of thinking of language are true:1. the more noise that is needed to edit from one alternative to another leads to lower likelihood thatthe alternative will be considered;2. in the noise process, deletions are more likely than insertions;3. increasing the noise increases the reliance on the prior (semantics); and4.
increasing the likelihood of implausible events decreases the reliance on the prior.Third, we show that this way of thinking about language leads to a simple re-thinking of the P600 fromthe ERP literature.
The P600 wave was originally proposed to be due to people?s sensitivity to syntacticviolations, but there have been many instances of problematic data in the literature for this interpretation.We show that the P600 can best be interpreted as sensitivity to an edit in the signal, in order to make itmore easily interpretable.Finally, we discuss how thinking of language as communication can explain aspects of the origin ofword order.
Some recent evidence suggests that subject-object-verb (SOV) may be the default word orderfor human language.
For example, SOV is the preferred word order in a task where participants gestureevent meanings (Goldin-Meadow et al.
2008).
Critically, SOV gesture production occurs not only forspeakers of SOV languages, but also for speakers of SVO languages, such as English, Chinese, Spanish(Goldin-Meadow et al.
2008) and Italian (Langus and Nespor, 2010).
The gesture-production tasktherefore plausibly reflects default word order independent of native language.
However, this leaves openthe question of why there are so many SVO languages (41.2% of languages; Dryer, 2005).
We proposethat the high percentage of SVO languages cross-linguistically is due to communication pressures over anoisy channel.
We provide several gesture experiments consistent with this hypothesis, and we speculatehow a noisy channel approach might explain several typical word order patterns that occur in the world?slanguages.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.
