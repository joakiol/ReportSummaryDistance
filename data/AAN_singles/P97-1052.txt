ukAbst rac tWe describe a method for interpreting ab-stract fiat syntactic representations, LFG f-structures, as underspecified semantic rep-resentations, here Underspecified DiscourseRepresentation Structures (UDRSs).
Themethod establishes a one-to-one correspon-dence between subsets of the LFG andUDRS formalisms.
It provides a modeltheoretic interpretation and an inferen-tial component which operates directlyon underspecified representations for f-structures through the translation imagesof f-structures as UDRSs.1 In t roduct ionLexical Functional Grammar (LFG) f-structures(Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982; Dalrymple t al., 1995a)are attribute-value matrices representing high levelsyntactic information abstracting away from the par-ticulars of surface realization such as word orderor inflection while capturing underlying eneraliza-tions.
Although f-structures are first and foremostsyntactic representations they do encode some se-mantic information, namely basic predicate argu-ment structure in the semantic form value of thePRED attribute.
Previous approaches to provid-ing semantic omponents for LFGs concentrated onproviding schemas for relating (or translating) f-structures (in)to sets of disambiguated semantic rep-resentations which are then interpreted model the-oretically (Halvorsen, 1983; Halvorsen and Kaplan,1988; Fenstad et al, 1987; Wedekind and Kaplan,1993; Dalrymple t al., 1996).
More recently, (Gen-abith and Crouch, 1996) presented a method forproviding a direct and underspecified interpretationof f-structures by interpreting them as quasi-logicalforms (QLFs) (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992).
The ap-proach was prompted by striking structural similar-ities between f-structure\['PRED ~COACH ~\]SUBJ NUM SG/SPEC EVERYPRED 'pick (T SUB J, T OBJ)'\[PRED 'PLAYER'\]L?B: iN'M s/ J LSPE?and QLF representations?Scope : pick (t erm(+r, <hUm= sg, spec=every>,coach, ?Q, ?X),term (+g, <num=sg, spec=a>,player, ?P, ?R) )both of which are fiat representations which allowunderspecification f e.g.
the scope of quantifica-tional NPs.
In this companion paper we show thatf-structures are just as easily interpretable asUDRSs(Reyle, 1993; Reyle, 1995):coach(x) layer(y)I pick(x,y) IWe do this in terms of a translation function r fromf-structures to UDRSs.
The recursive part of the def-inition states that the translation of an f-structure issimply the union of the translation of its componentparts:'F1 71...T( PRED I-\[(~ rl,...,l l~n) )r, .

uWhile there certainly is difference in approach andemphasis between f-structures, QLFs and UDRSs402the motivation foi" flat (underspecified) representa-tions in each case is computational.
The details ofthe LFG and UDRT formalisms are described atlength elsewhere: here we briefly present the verybasics of the UDRS formalism; we define a languageof wff-s (well-formed f-structures); we define a map-ping 7" from f-structures to UDRSs together with areverse mapping r -1 and we show correctness withrespect o an independent semantics (Dalrymple tal., 1996).
Finally, unlike QLF the UDRS formal-ism comes equipped with an inference mechanismwhich operates directly on the underspecified rep-resentations without the need of considering cases.We illustrate our approach with a simple exampleinvolving the UDRS deduction component (see also(KSnig and Reyle, 1996) where amongst other thingsthe possibility of direct deductions on f-structures idiscussed).2 Underspec i f ied  D iscourseRepresentat ion  S t ructuresIn standard DRT (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) scope re-lations between quantificational structures and op-erators are unambiguously specified in terms of thestructure and nesting of boxes.
UDRT (Reyle, 1993;Reyle, 1995) allows partial specifications of scoperelations.
Textual definitions of UDRSs are basedon a labeling (indexing) of DRS conditions and astatement of a partial ordering relation between thelabels.
The language of UDRSs is based on a setL of labels, a set Ref  of discourse referents and aset Rel of relation symbols.
It features two types ofconditions: 11.
(a) i f /E  L and x E Ref then  l : x is a condition(b) if 1 E L, R E Rel a n-place relation andXl, .
.
,Xn E Ref  then l : P(Xl, ..,Xn) is acondition(c) if li, lj E L then li : '~lj is a condition(d) if li, lj, Ik E L then li : lj ::?, l~ is a condition(e) if l, l l , .
.
.
, l n  E L then l :  V( l l , .
.
.
, ln)  is acondition2.
if li, Ij E L then li < lj is a condition where _< isa partial ordering defining an upper semi-latticewith a top element.UDRSs are pairs of a set of type 2 conditions witha set of type 1 conditions:?
A UDRS /C is a pair (L,C) where L = ( i ,<)is an upper semi-lattice of labels and C a set ofconditions of type 1 above such that if li : ~lj E1The definition abstracts away from some of the com-plexities in the full definitions of the UDRS language(Reyle, 1993).
The full language also contains type 1conditions of the form 1 : a( l l , .
.
.
, ln )  indicating that(/1,..., In) are contributed by a single sentence tc.C then l j  :< li E ?
and ifl i : lj ~ lk E C thenlj < li,lk < li E ?.2The construction of UDRSs, in particular the speci-fication of the partial ordering between labeled con-ditions in ?, is constrained by a set of meta-levelconstraints (principles).
They ensure, e.g., thatverbs are subordinated with respect to their scopeinducing arguments, that scope sensitive elementsobey the restrictions postulated by whatever syn-tactic theory is adopted, that potential antecedentsare scoped with respect o their anaphoric potentialetc.
Below we list the basic cases:?
Clause Boundedness: the scope of genuinelyquantificational structures is clause bounded.If lq and let are the labels associated with thequantificational structure and the containingclause, respectively, then the constraint lq < letenforces clause boundedness.?
Scope of Indefinites: indefinites labeled li maytake arbitrarily wide scope in the representa-tion.
They cannot exceed the top-level DRS IT,i.e.
li < IT.?
Proper Names: proper names, 7r, always endup in the top-level DRS, IT.
This is specifiedlexically by IT : rThe semantics i defined in terms of disambiguations& It takes its cue from the definition of the conse-quence relation; in the most recent version (Reyle,1995) with correlated isambiguations 8tV61( r~, D M')resulting in a conjunctive interpretation of a goalUDRS.
3 In contrast to other proof systems theUDRS proof systems (Reyle, 1993; Reyle, 1995;Kbnig and Reyle, 1996) operate directly on under-specified representations avoiding (whenever possi-ble) the need to consider disambiguated cases.
43 A language o f  we l l - fo rmedf - s t ruc turesThe language of wff-s (well-formed f-structures) isdefined below.
The basic vocabulary consists of fivedisjoint sets: GFs (subcategorizable grammaticalfunctions), GF,~ (non-subcategorizable grammaticalfunctions), SF  (semantic forms), ATR (attributes)and ATOM (atomic values):2This closes Z: under the subordination relations in-duced by complex conditions of the form -~K and Ki =~Kj.38 is an o~eration mapping a into one of its disam-biguations c~ .
The original semantics in (Reyle, 1993)took its cue from V~i3/ij(F 6i ~ v~ 6j) resulting in a dis-junctive semantics.4 Soundness and completeness results are given for thesystem in (Reyle, 1993).403?

Tags are used to represent reentranciesand will often appear vacuously.
The definition cap-tures f-structures that are complete, coherent andconsistent.64 An  f - s t ruc ture  - UDRS re turn  t r ipIn order to illustrate the basic idea we will first givea simplified graphical definition of the translation rfrom f-structures to UDRSs.
The full textual defini-tions are given in the appendix?

Because of lackof space here we can not consider non-subcategorizablegrammatical functions.
For a treatment of those ina QLF-style interpretation see (Genabith and Crouch,1996).
The notions of substructure occurring in an .f-structure and dom(~o) can easily be spelled out formally.The definition given above uses textual representationsof f-structures.
It can easily be recast in terms of hier-archical sets, finite functions, directed graphs etc.quantificational NPs and indefinite NPs.

Thisestablishes a one-to-one correspondence betweensubsets of the UDRS and LFG formalism.
Note that7" -1 is a partial function on UDRS representations.The reason is that in addition to full underspecifica-tion UDRT allows partial underspecification f scopefor which there is no correlate in the original LFGf-structure formalism.5 Correctness of the Translat ionA correctness criterion for the translation can be de-fined in terms of preservation of truth with respectto an independent semantics.
Here we show correct-ness with respect o the linear logic (a)s based LFGsemantics of (Dalrymple t al., 1996):\ [ r (~) \ ]  --- \ [~(~) \ ]Correctness is with respect to (sets of) disambigua-tions and truthfl{ulu = 6(r(~))} - {ll~(~ ) ~,  l}where 6 is the UDRS disambiguation and b'u the lin-ear logic consequence relation.
Without going intodetails/f works by adding subordination constraintsturning partial into total orders.

Again,in the absence of scope constraints this results inn!

Everything else be-ing equal, this establishes correctness with respectto sets of disambiguations.6 A Worked  ExampleWe illustrate our approach in terms of a simple ex-ample inference.
The translations below are ob-tained with the full definitions in the appendix.\[~ Every coach supported a player.Smith is a coach.Smith supported a player.Premise ~ is ambiguous between an wide scope anda narrow scope reading of the indefinite NP.
From \[-fland \[\]  we can conclude Ii\] which is not ambiguous.Assume that the following (simplified) f-structures!a\[~\], ?

(KSnig and Reyle, 1996)amongst other things further explores this issue andproposes direct deduction on LFG f-structures.
Wehave formulated a reverse translation from UDRSsback into f-structures and established a one-to-onecorrespondence between subsets of the LFG andUDRT formalisms.
As it stands, however, the levelof f-structure representation does not express thefull range of subordination constraints available inUDRT.
In this paper we have covered the most basicparts, the easy bits.
The method has to be extendedto a more extensive fragment to prove (or disprove)its mettle.
The UDRT and QLF (Genabith andCrouch, 1996) interpretations of f-structures invitecomparison of the two semantic formalisms.
With-out being able to go into any great detail, QLFand UDRT both provide underspecified semanticsfor ambiguous representations A in terms of sets{col, .
.
.
,  COn } of fully disambiguated representationsCOi which can be obtained from A.
For a simple corefragment (disregarding dynamic effects, wrinkles ofthe UDRS and QLF disambiguation operations/)~and 79q etc.)
everything else being equal, for a givensentence S with associated QLF and UDRS repre-sentations Aq and A~, respectively, we have thatDq(Aq) = {COl,..., q CO~} and "D~,(Au) = {CO?,..., CO,I}and pairwise \[CO/q \] = \[\[CO u\] for 1 < i < n andcol 6 ~)q(Aq) and COl' e 7)~(A=).
That is-the QLFand UDRT semantics coincide with respect o truthconditions Of representations in corresponding setsof disambiguations.
This said, however, they differwith respect to the semantics assigned to the un-derspecified representations Aq and An.
\[\[Aq~ is de-fined in terms of a supervaluation construction over{CO q .

In (Reyle, 1995):+' A +')(where IE e+ =COi E :D,,(\]E)) which implies that a goalUDRS is interpreted conjunctively:\[A~,~ 95 = 1 ifffor all CO u E 7:)~,(A~,), \[COr~ 9s = 1\[Au\]gs = 0 otherwisewhile the definition in (Reyle, 1993):+' Aresults in a disjunctive interpretation:406\ [A.\]  93 = 1 ifffor some O}' E V.(A,~), \[0~\]93 = 1\[Au\]\]93 = 0 otherwiseIt is easy to see that the UDRS semantics \[o~\] 95and\[\[od\] 93 each cover the two opposite nds of the QLFsemantics \[\[%\]\]: [o=\] 95 covers definite truth while\[\[Ou\] 93covers definite falsity.On a final note, the remarkable correspondence b -tween LFG f-structure and UDRT and QLF repre-sentations (the latter two arguably being the ma-jor recent underspecified semantic representationformalisms) provides further independent motiva-tion for a level of representation similar to LFG f-structure which antedates its underspecified seman-tic cousins by more than a decade.8 AppendixWe now define a translation r from f-structures toUDRSs.
The (U)DRT construction principles distin-guish between genuinely quantificational NPs, indef-inite NPs and proper names.
Accordingly we have?
~(\[pRED n(t r l , .

T~\](\[PRED l-I 0 \ ]~)  :={tT : xm,tT : n(xm),lmo _< l~}The first clause defines the recursive part of thetranslation function and states that the translationof an f-structure is simply the union of the trans-lations of its component parts.
The base cases ofthe definition are provided by the three remainingclauses.
They correspond irectly to the construc-tion principles discussed in section 2.
The first onedeals with genuinely quantificational NPs, the sec-ond one with indefinites and the third one withproper names.
Note that the definitions ensureclause boundedness of quantificational NPs {l\[/\] <l\[\] } , allow indefinites to take arbitrary wide scope{1\[\]\] <_h-} and assign proper names to the top levelof the resulting UDRS {iv : z~, /v  : H(zffj)} as re-quired.
The indices are our book-keeping devices forlabel and variable management.
F-structure reen-trancies are handled correctly without further stipu-lation.
Atomic attribute-value pairs can be includedas unary definite relations.For the reverse mapping assume a consistent UDRSlabeling (e.g.
as provided by the v mapping) anda lexically specified mapping between subcategoriz-able grammatical functions in LFG semantic formand argument positions in the corresponding UDRTpredicates:II( gel, ~g2, . '

It assumes proper UDRSs, i.e.
UDRS whereall the discourse referents are properly bound.
Thus thedefinition implements the "garbage in - garbage out"principle.
It also assumes that discourse referents in"quantifier prefixes" are disjoint.
It is straightforwardto extend the definition to take account of subordina-t~ion constraints if that is desired but, as we remarkedabove, the translation image (the resulting f-structures)cannot in all cases reflect the constraints.407{la, : Th,la, : II(rh)} U {.~ < l?,,l()~ < la,) E E} if T/i e RefO(o~,/~):= {l,~, l,~.Voil~,,~,l,~,, : ?,,1,~.

T- I ({ IT  : X, IT : I I (x )}~S~b) :=\[PREp n0 \]\[\]Note that r -1 is a partial function from UDRSs tof-structures.
The reason is that that f-structures donot represent partial subordination constraints, inother words they are fully underspecified.
Finally,note that r and r -1 are recursive (they allow for ar-bitrary embeddings of e.g.
sentential complements).This may lead to structures outside the first-orderUDRT-fragment.
As an example the reader maywant to check the translation in F igure  3 and fur-thermore verify that the reverse translation does in-deed take us back to the original (modulo renamingof variables and labels) UDRS.9 AcknowledgementsEarly versions of this have been presented at Fra-CaS workshops (Cooper et al, 1996) and at \]MS,Stuttgart in 1995 and at the LFG96 in Grenoble.We thank our FraCaS colleagues and Anette Frankand Mary Dalrymple for discussion and support.Re ferencesH.
