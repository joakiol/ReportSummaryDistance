Paraphrasing Using Given and New Informationin a Question-Answer SystemKathleen R. McKeownDepartment of Computer and Information ScienceThe Moore SchoolUniversity of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa. 19104ABSTRACT: The design and implementation of a paraphrasecomponent for a natural language questlon-answer system(CO-OP) is presented.
A major point made is the role ofgiven and new information in formulating a paraphrasethat differs in a meaningful way from the user'squestion.
A description is also given of thetransformational grammar used by the paraphraser togenerate questions.I ?
INTRO~IONIn a natural language interface to a database querysystem, a paraphraser can be used to ensure that thesystem has correctly understood the user.
Such aparaphraser has been developed as part of the CO-OPsystem \[ KAPLAN 79\].
In CO-OP, an internalrepresentation of the user's question is passed to theparaphraser which then generates a new version of thequestion for the user.
Upon seeing the paraphrase, theuser has the option of rephrasing her/his questionbefore the system attempts to answer it.
Thus, if thequestion was not interpreted correctly, the error can becaught before a possibly lengthy search of the databaseis initiated.
Furthermore, the user is assured that theanswer s/he receives is an answer to the question askedand not to a deviant version of it.The idea of using a paraphraser in the above way is notnew.
To date, other systems have used canned templatesto form paraphrases, filling in empty slots in thepattern with information from the user's question\[WALTZ 78; CODD 78\].
In CO-OP, a transformationalgrammar is used to generate the paraphrase from aninternal representation of the question.
Moreover, theCO-OP paraphraser generates a question that differs in ameaningful way from the original question.
It makes useof a distinction between given and new information toindicate to the user the existential presuppositionsmade In her/his question.II.
OVERVIEW OF THE CO-OP S~"3-rEMThe CO-OP system is aimed at infrequent users ofdatabase query systems.
These casual users are likelyto be unfamiliar with computer systems and unwilling toinvest the time needed to learn a formal query language.Being able to converse naturally in English enables suchpersons to tap the information available in a database.In order to allow the question-answer process to proceednaturally, CO-OP follows some of the "co-operativeprinciples" of conversation \[GRICE 75\].
In particular,the system attempts to find meaningful answers to failedquestions by addressing any incorrect assumptions thequestioner may have made in her/his question.
When thedirect response to a question would be simply "no" or"none", CO-OP gives a more informative response bycorrecting the questloner's mistaken asstm~tlons.The false assumptions that CO-OP corrects are theexistential presuppositions of the question.
* Sincethese presuppositions can he computed from the surfacestructure of the question, a large store of semanticknowledge for inferenclng purposes is not needed.
In*For example, in the question "Which users work onprojects sponsored by NASA?
', the speaker makes theexistential presupposition that there are projectsmpommred by NASA.67fact, a lexicon and database schema are the onlyitems which contain domain-specific information.Consequently, the CO-OP system is a portable one; achange of database requires that only these twoknowledge sources be modified.III.
THE CO-OP PARAP~%~SERCO-OP's paraphraser provides the only means oferror-checking for the casual user.
If the ?,ser isfamiliar with the system, s/he can ask to have theintermediate results printed, in which case the parser'soutput and the formal database query will be shown.
Thenaive user however, is unlikely to understand theseresults.
It is for this reason that the paraphraser wasdesigned to respond in English.The use of English to paraphrase queries creates severalproblems.
The first is that natural language isinherently ambiguous.
A paraphrase must clarify thesystem's interpretation of possible ambiguous phrases inthe question without introducing additional ambiguity.One particular type of ambiguity that a paraphraser mustaddress is caused by the linear nature of sentences.
Amodifying relative clause, for example, frequentlycannot be placed directly after the noun phrase itmodifies.
In such cases, the semantics of the sentencemay indicate the correct choice of modified noun phrase,but occasionally,, the sentence may be genuinelyambiguouS.
For example, question (A) below has twointerpretations, both equally plausible.
The speakercould be referring to books dating from the '~0s or tocomputers dating from the '60s.
(A) Which students read books on computers datingfrom the '60s?A second problem in paraphrasing English queries is thepossibility of generating the exact question that wasoriginally asked.
If a grammar were developed to simplygenerate English from an underlying representation ofthe question this possibility could be realized.Instead, a method must be devised which can determinehow the phrasing should differ from the original.The CO-OF paraphraser addresses both the problem ofambiguity and the rephrasing of the question.
It makesthe system's interpretation of the question explicit bybreaking down the clauses of the question and reorderingthem dependent upon their function in the sentence.Thus, questlon (A) above will result in ei therparaphrase (B) or (C), reflecting the interpretation thesystem has chosen.
(B) Assuming that there are books on computers(those computers date from the '60s), whichstudents read those books?
(C) Assuming that there are hooks on computers(those hooks date from the '~Os), which studentsread those books?~1~e method adopted guarantees that the paraphrase willdiffer from the original except in cases where norelative clauses or prepositional phrases were used.
Itwas formulated on the basis of a distinction betweengiven and new information and indicates to the user thepresuppositions s/he has made in the question (in the"assuming that" clause), while focussing her/hisattention on the attributes of the class s/he isinterested in.IV.
LINGUISTIC 8ACI~ROUNDAs mentioned ear l ie r ,  the lex icon and the database arethe sole sources of  world knowledqe for  CO-OP.
Whilethis design increases CO-OP's portability, it means thatl i t t le  semantic information is ava i lab le  for theparaphraser's use.
Contextual information is  a lsolimlte~ since no running history or context  ismaintained for a user session in the current version.The input the paraphraser receives from the parser  i sbasically a syntactic parse tree of the question.
Usingthis information, the paraphraser must reconstruct  thequest ion to obtain a phrasing d i f fe rent  from theor ig ina l .
The fol lowing quest ion must there fore  beaddressed:What reasons are there for choosing one syntacticform of express ion over another?Some l ingu is ts  maintain that  word order is  a f fected byfunct iona l  ro les elements p lay w i th in  the sentence.
*Terminology used to describe the t~pes of  ro les that  canoccur var ies  wide ly .
Some of  the d l s t inc tons  that  havebeen described include given/new, topic/comment,theme/theme, and presupposition/focus.
Definitions ofthese terms however, are not consistent (for example,see \[PRINCE ?9\] for a discussion of various usages of"given/new" ) .Nevertheless, one inf luence on expression does appear tobe the in teract ion  of  sentence content and the be l ie fsof the speaker concerning the knowledge of  the l i s tener .Some elements in the sentence funct ion in conveyinginformation which the speaker assumes is  present in the"consciousness = of the listener \[CHAFE ?fi\].
Thisinformation is said to be contextually dependent, eitherby virtue of its presence in the preceding discourse orbecause i t  i s  part  of the shared world knowledge of thedialog participants.
In a question-answer sys~,shared world knowledge refers to information which thespeaker assumes is present in the database.
Informationfunct ioning in the ro le  jus t  descr ibed has been termed"given".
"New" labels all information in the sentence which ispresented as not re t r ievab le  from context .
In thedeclarative, elements functioning in assertinginformation What the listener is presumed not to knoware called new.
In the question, elements funci:ioningin conveying what the s~eaker wants to know ( i .e .
-  whats/he doesn ' t  know) represent  information which thespeaker presumes the l i s tener  i s  not already aware o f .Flrbas identifies additional functions in the question.Of these, ( i i )  i s  used here .to aug~mt thein terpreta t ion  of new informat ion.
He says:"( i )  it ind icates the want of  knowledge on the par tof the inqui rer  and appeals to the informant osatisfy this want.

IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEWThe paraphraser's first step in processing is to build atree structure from the representation it is given.
Thetree is then divided into three separate treesreflecting the division of given and new information Inthe question.
The design of the tree allows for asimple set of rules which flatten the tree.
The finalstage of processing in the paraphraser is translation.In the translation phase, labels In the parser'srepresentation are translated into their correspondingwords.
During this process, necessary transformationsof the grammar are performed upon the string.Several aspects of the implementation will not bediscussed here, but a description can be found in\[MCKEOWN 791.
The method used by the paraphraser tohandle conjunction, disjunction, and limitedquantification is one of these.
A second function ofthe paraphraser is also descr ibed In \[MCKEOWN 79\].
Theset of procedures used to paraphrase the user's querycan also be used to generate an English version of theparser's output.
If the tree is not divided into givenand new information, the flattening and transfor,mtlonalrules can be applied to produce a question that is notin the three-part form.
rn CO-OP, generation is used toproduce corrections of the user's mistakenpresupposi tions.
* This example, as well as all sample questions andparaphrases that follow, were, =aken from actual sessionswith the paraphraser .
Quest ion  (A)mad its possibleparaphcases (B) and (C) are the only examples that werenot run on the paraphraser .A.
THE PHRA.qE STRUCTURE TREEIn its initial processing, the paraphraser transformsthe parser's representation into one that is moreconvenient for generation purposes.
The resultantstructure is a tree that highlights certain syntacticfeatures of the question.
This initial processing givesthe paraphraser some independence from the CO-OP system.Were the parser's representation changed or thecomponent moved to a new system, only the initialprocessing phase need be modified.The paraphraser's phrase structure tree uses the mainverb of the question as the root node of the tree.
1"Nesubject of the main verb is the root node of the leftsubtree, the object (if there is one) the root node ofthe right subtree.
In the current system, the use ofbinary relations in the parser's representation (see\[KAPLAN 79\] for a description of Meta Query Language)creates the illusion that every verb or preposition hasa subject and object.
Tne paraphraser's tree does allowfor the representation of other constructions should theincccning language use them.Each of the subtrees represents o ther  clauses in thequestion.
Both the subject and the object of the mainverb will have a subtree for each other clause itparticipates in.
If a noun in one of these clauses alsoparticipates in another clause in the sentence, it willhave subtrees too.As an example, consider the question: "~Fnlch activeusers advised by Thomas Wirth work on projects in area3?".
The phrase structure tree used in the paraphraseris shown in Figure I.
Since "work" is the main verb, itwill be the root node of the tree.
"users" is root ofthe left subtree, "projects" of the right.
Each nounparticipates in one other clause and therefore has onesubtree.
Note that the adjective "active" does notappear as part of the tree structure.
Instead, it isclosely bound to the noun it modifies and is treated asa property of the noun.+7\users projectsadvised by/ ~ inThomas wlrth areaobject objectFigure iB.
DIVIDING THE TREETne constructed tree is computatlonslly suited for thethree-part paraphrase.
The tree is flattened after ithas been divided into subtrees containing giveninformation and the two types of new information.
Thesplitting of the tree is accomplished by firstextracting the topmost smallest portion of the treecontaining the wh-item.
At the very least, this willinclude the root node plus the left and right subtreeroot nodes.
This portion of the tree is the strippeddown question.
The clauses ~hlch define the particularaspect frora which the question is asked are found bysearching the left and right subtrees for the wh-ltem orquestioned noun.
The subtree whose root node is thewh-item contains these clauses.
Note that this may bethe entire left or right subtree or may only be asubtree of one of these.
The remainder of the treerepresents given information.

TRANSFORMATIONSThe graewar used in the paraphraser is atransformat ional  one.
In addition to the basicf la t ten ing  rules descr ibed above, the fol lowingtransformations are used:~an~ -fr?ntingation~.do-support(~subject-aux i nvers ion~f  flx-hoppingkcontrsctionhas de le t ionThe curved l ines  ind icate  the order ing res t r i c t ions .There are two connected groups of t ransformat ions .
Ifwh-fronting applies, then so will do-support,subJect-aux inversion, and affix-hopplng.
The secondgroup of transformations is invoked through theapplication of negation.
It includes do-support,contraction, and affix-hopping.
Has-de le t ion  i s  notaffected b 7 the absence or presence of othertranafomations.
A description of the transformationrules follo~.
The rules used here are based onanalyses descr ibed by \ [~ IAN and ~ 75\] andanalyses described by \[CULLICOV~ 76\].The rule for wh-fronting is specified as follows, whereSD abbreviates structural description and SC, structuralchange:SD: X - NP - Yi 2 3SC: 2+i 0 3condition: 2 dominates whThe first step in the implementation of wh-fronting is asearch of the tree for the wh-item.
A slightlyd i f fe rent  approach is used for paraphrasing than i s  usedfor  generat ion.
The d i f fe rence  occurs because in theoriginal question, the NP to  be fronted may be the headnoun of some re la t ive  c lauses or p repos i t iona l  phrases.When generating, these clauses must be fronted alongwith the heed noun.
Since the clauses of the or ig ina lque~ion  are broken down for  the paraphrase,  i t  w i l lnever he the case when pars~hrss ing that  the NP to befronted also dominates re la t ive  c lauses or p repos i t iona lphrases.
For th i s  reason, when paraphrase mode is  used,the app l i cab i l i ty  of wh-front ing is  tas ted  for and isappl ied in the f la t ten ing  process of the s t r ipped downquest ion.
I f  i t  app l ies ,  only one word need be moved tothe in i t ia l  pos i t ion .When generation is being done, the appl icab i l i ty  ofwh-fronting is tested for immediately before f lattening.If the transformation app l ies ,  the tree is split.
Thesubtree of which the wh-itmn is the root is flattenedseparstely from the remair~er of the tree and isattached in fronted position to the string resultingfrom flattening the other part.After wh-fronting has been appl led, do-support isinvoked.
In CO-OP, the underlying representation of theq~aat ion does not  conta in  mudals o r  aux i l i a ry  verbs .Thus, fronting the wh-item necessitates supplying anauxiliary.
The following rule is used for do-support:SD: NP - NP - tense - V - X1 2 3 4SC= 1 do+2 3 4condi t ion= 1 dominates whSubJect-aux inversion is activated immediatelyafterwards.
Aqaln, if wh-frontlng applied, subject-auxinversion will apply also.
The rule is=SD: NP - NP - AUX - XI 2 3 4SC: I 3+2 0 4condition: i dominates whAffix-hopping follows subject-aux inversion.
In theParaphraser it is a combination of what is commonlythought of as afflx-hopplng and number-agreement.
Tenseand number are attributes of all verbs in the Parser'srepresentation.
When an auxiliary is generated, thetense and n~nber are "hopped" from the verb to theauxiliary.
Formally:SD: X - AUX - Y - tense-nua~-V - Zi 2 3 4 5 6SC: 1 2+4 3 0 5 6Some transformational analyses propose that wh-frontlngand subJect-aux inversion aPPly to the relative clauseas well as the question.
In the CO-OP Paraphraser, theheed-noun is properly positioned by the flatteningprocess and wh-frontlng need not be used.
Subject-auxinversion however, may be applicable.
In cases wherethe head noun of the clause is not its subject,subject-aux inversion results in the proper order.?
The rule for negation is tested during the translationphase of execution.
It has been formalized as:SD: X - tense-V - NP - Y1 2 3 4SC: i 2+no 3 4condition: 3 marked as negativeIn Ehe CO-OP representation, an indication of negationis carried on the object of a binary relation (see\[KAPLAN 79\] ).
When generating an English representationof the question, it is possible in some cases to expressnegation as modification of the noun (see question (H)below).
In all cases however, negation can be indicatedas Part of the verb (see version (I) of question (H)).Therefore, when the object is marked as negative, theParaphraser moves the negation to heroine Part of theverbal  element.
(R) which s tudents  have no adv isors?
( I)  Which students don ' t  have advisors?In English, the negative marker is attached to theaux i l i a ry  of the verbal element and therefore,  as wasthe case for  questions, an aux i l i a ry  must be generated.Do-support is used.
The rule used for do-support afternegation differs from the one used after wh-frontlng.They are presented this way for clarity, but could havebeen combined into one rule.SD: X - tense-V-no - Y1 2 3SC: 1 do+2 3Affix-hopping, as described above, hops the tense,number, and negation from the verb to the auxiliaryverb.
The cycle of t rans format ions  invoked thruappl icat ion  of negation is completed with thecontract ion transformation.
The statement of thecontraction transformation Is"SD: X - do+tense -no - Y1 2 3 4SC: I #2+n* t# 0 4where # indicates that the result must he treated as aunit for  fur ther  transformations.VII.
CONCLUSIONSThe paraphraser  described here is  a sy l l tact ic  one.whi le th i s  work has examined the reasons for  d i f fe rentforme .
)f express ion ,  add i t ions  must be made in the areaof semantics.
The substitution of synonyms, phrases, oridioms for portions or all of the question requires anexamination of the effect of context on word meaning andof the intentions of the speaker on word or phrasechoice.
The lack of a rich semantic base and contextualinformation dictated the syntactic approach used here,but the paraphraser can be extended once a wider rangeof information becomes available.The CO-OP paraphraser has been designed to bedomain-independent and thus a change of the databaserequires no charges in the paraphraser.
Paraphraserswhich use the template form hbwever, w i l l  require suchchanges.
This is because the templates or patterns,which const i tute  the type of question that  can be asked,are necessari ly dependent on the domain.
For d i f fe rentdatabases, a d i f fe rent  set of templates must be used.The CO-OP Paraphraser also d i f fe rs  from other systems inthat i t  generates the question using a transformationalgrammar of questions.
It addresses two specificproblems involved in generating paraphrases-"I. ambiguity in determining which noun phrases arelative clause modifies2.
