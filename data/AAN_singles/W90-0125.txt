rNarrated  An imat ion :  A Case for Generat ionNorman Badler Mark SteedmanDepartment of Computer and Information ScienceUniversity of PennsylvaniaPhiladelphia PA 19104-63891Bonnie Lynn Webber1 In t roduct ionOur project rests on the belief that computer animation in the form of narrated animatedsimulations can provide an engaging, effective and flexible medium for instructing agents ofvarying capabilities to perform tasks that make varying demands in workplaces of varying layout.To this end, we have been designing and implementing an integrated system which combines?
animated agents which can demonstrate the behavior to be emulated;?
automatic generation of appropriate Natural Language narration which can explain whatis being done and why.To date, our primary concern with Natural Language has been as input to the system, inline with the strong claim we make in \[1\] that moving task animation beyond direct graphicalmanipulation forces one to Natural Language as the only instruction source accessible to otherusers than the current community of manually skilled (or programming-wise) animators.
(Tothis end, we have been analysing constructions commonly found in NL instructions, in terms oftheir representational requirements \[3\].However here our point of discussion is NL Generation.
What makes us such eager con-sumers of advances and technology in this area is that animated simulations without narration(ultimately, spoken narration) is only half the story.
As researchers studying plan inferencehave shown \[2\], it may be well-nigh impossible to infer an agent's intentions imply by observinghis or her actions alone.
2 And we know that the ability to perform an action effectively in arange of environments requires understanding its intention, not just the physical motions usedin some performance.
Thus, communicating intentions is as important o effective task instruc-tion as demonstrating physical skills.
Sharing the burden of communication between NaturalLanguage and graphics, as Feiner and McKeown have noted \[4\], takes advantage of the best ofboth possible worlds.While some parts of our system are further along than others, no work at all has yet beendone on generation.
However, we have tried to take account of the needs of generation indesigning the system, so that we will not have painted ourselves in a hole from the start.
Weclearly and hope to get further ideas and direction from this meeting.
Basically, the system hasbeen designed so that the generator will receive information from three sources (see Figure 1.

the basic animation commands (for particulars of what's happening "now")?
the visualization plan (for what can the viewer see).The resulting narrative is thus meant to satisfy the joint communicative goals of providingan overall context in which to view the events on the "screen" and explaining the reasons forparticular events that are happening, thereby transcending the merely visible portion of anyevent, to augment and reinforce observable behavior.
