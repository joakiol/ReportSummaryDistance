In this cam-paign, we explore Chinese personal namedisambiguation in news.
In order to examine howwell disambiguation technologies work, we con-centrate on news articles, which is well-formattedand whose genre is well-studied.
We then design adiagnosis test to explore the impact of Chineseword segmentation to personal name disambigua-tion.1 IntroductionIncorporating semantic understanding technolo-gies from the field of NLP becomes one of furtherdirections for information retrieval.
Among them,named entity disambiguation, which intends touse state-of-the-art named entity processing toenhance a search engine, is a hot research issue.Because of the popularity of personal names inqueries, more efforts are put on personal namedisambiguation.
The personal name disambigua-tion used both in Web Personal Search (WePS1)and our campaign is defined as follow.
Givendocuments containing a personal name in interest,the task is to cluster them according to which en-tity the name in a document refers to.WePS, which explores English personal namedisambiguation, has been held twice (Artiles et al,1http://nlp.uned.es/weps/2007, 2009).
Compared to the one in English, per-sonal name disambiguation in Chinese has specialissues, such as Chinese text processing and Chi-nese personal naming system.
Therefore, we holdChinese personal name disambiguation (CPND) toexplore those problems.
In this campaign, wemainly examine the relationships between Chineseword segmentation and Chinese personal namedisambiguation.Moreover, from our experiences in WePS(Chen et al, 2007, 2009), we notice that webpagesare so noisy that text pre-processing that extractsuseful text for disambiguation needs much effort.In fact, text pre-processing for webpages is rathercomplicated, such as deleting of HTML tags, thedetection of JavaScript codes and so on.
Therefore,the final system performance in the WePS cam-paign sometimes does not reflect the disambigua-tion power of the system, and instead it shows thecomprehensive result of text pre-processing aswell as disambiguation.
In order to focus on per-sonal name disambiguation, we choose newsdocuments in CPND.The paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 de-scribes our formal test including datasets andevaluation.
Section 3 introduces the diagnosis test,which explores the impact of Chinese word seg-mentation to personal name disambiguation.
Sec-tion 4 describes our campaign, and Section 5presents the results of the participating systems.Finally, Section 6 concludes our main findings inthis campaign.2 The Formal Test2.1 DatasetsTo avoid the difficulty to clean a webpage, wechoose news articles in this campaign.
Given afull name in Chinese, we search the character-based personal name string in all documents ofChinese Gigaword Corpus, a large Chinese newscollection.
If a document contains the name, it isbelonged to the dataset of this name.
To ensurethe popularity of a personal name, we keep only apersonal name whose corresponding dataset com-prises more than 100 documents.
In addition, ifthere are more than 300 documents in that dataset,we randomly select 300 articles to annotate.
Fi-nally, there are totally 58 personal names and12,534 news articles used in our data, where 32names are in the development data and 26 namesare in the test data, as shown Appendix Table 4and 5 separately.From Table 4 and 5, we can find that the ambi-guity (the document number per cluster) distribu-tion is much different between the developmentdata and the test data.
In fact, the ambiguity var-ies with a personal name in interest, such as thepopularity of the name in the given corpus, thecelebrity degree of the name, and so on.2.2 EvaluationIn WePS, Artiles et al (2009) made an intensivestudy of clustering evaluation metrics, and foundthat B-Cubed metric is an appropriate evaluationapproach.
Moreover, in order to handle overlap-ping clusters (i.e.
a personal name in a documentrefers to more than one person entity in reality),we extend B-Cubed metric as Table 1, where S ={S1, S2, ?}
is a system clustering  and R = {R1,R2, ?}
is a gold-standard clustering.
The finalperformance of a system clustering for a personalname is the F score (?= 0.5), and the final per-formance of a system is the Mac F score, the aver-age of the F scores of all personal names.Moreover, Artiles et al (2009) also discussthree cheat systems: one-in-one, all-in-one, andthe hybrid cheat system.
One-in-one assigns eachdocument into a cluster, and in contrast, all-in-oneput all documents into one cluster.
The hybridcheat system just incorporates all clusters both inone-in-one and all-in-one clustering.
Although thehybrid cheat system can achieve fairly good per-formance, it is not useful for real applications.
Inthe formal test, these three systems serve as thebaseline.FormulaPrecision??

In order to explore the relationshipbetween personal name disambiguation and wordsegmentation, we provide a diagnosis data whichattempts to examine the impact of word segmenta-tion to disambiguation.Firstly, for each personal name, its correspond-ing dataset will be manually divided into threegroups as follows.
The disambiguation systemthen runs for each group of documents.
The threeclustering outputs are merged into the final clus-tering for that personal name.
(1) Exactly matching: news articles contain-ing personal names that exactly matchthe query personal name.
(2) Partially matching: news articles contain-ing personal names that are super-stringsof the query personal name.
For instance,an article that has a person named with?????
(Gao Jun Tian)  is retrievedfor the query personal name ????
(GaoJun).
(3) Discarded: news articles containingcharacter sequences that match the querypersonal name string and however in factare not a personal name.
For instance, anarticle that has the string ????????
(Zui Gao Jun Shi Fa Yuan: suprememilitary court) is also retrieved for thepersonal name ????
(Gao Jun).This diagnosis test is designed to simulate therealistic scenario where Chinese word segmenta-tion works before personal name disambiguation.If a Chinese word segmenter works perfectly, aword-based matching can be used to retrieve thedocuments containing a personal name, and arti-cles in Groups (2) and (3) should not be returned.The personal name disambiguation task that islimited to the documents in Group (1) should besimpler.Moreover, in this diagnosis test, we propose abaseline based on the gold-standard word segmen-tation as follows, namely the word-segment sys-tem.1) All articles in the ?exactly matching?group are merged into a cluster, and allarticles in the ?discarded?
group aremerged into a cluster.2) In the ?partially matching?
group, enti-ties exactly sharing the same personalname are merged into a cluster.
For ex-ample, all articles containing ?????
(Gao Jun Tian) are merged into a cluster,and all articles containing????
(GaoJun Hua) are merged into another cluster.4 Campaign Design4.1 The ParticipantsThe task of Chinese personal name disambigua-tion in news has attracted the participation of 10teams.
As a team can submit at most 2 results,there are 17 submissions from the 10 teams in theformal test, and there are 11 submissions from 7teams in the diagnosis.4.2 System descriptionsRegarding system architecture, all systems arebased on clustering, and most of them comprisetwo components: feature extraction and clustering.However, NEU-1 and HITSZ_CITYU develop adifferent clustering, which in fact is a cascadedclustering.
Taking the advantage of the propertiesof a news article, both systems first divide thedataset for a personal name into two groups ac-cording to whether the person in question is a re-porter of the news.
They then choose a differentstrategy to make further clustering for each group.In terms of feature extraction, we find that allsystems except SoochowHY use word segmenta-tion as pre-processing.
Moreover, most systemschoose named entity detection to enhance theirfeature extraction.
In addition, character-basedbigrams are also used in some systems.
In Ap-pendix Table 6, we give the summary of wordsegmentation and named entity detection used inthe participating systems.Regarding clustering algorithms, agglomerativehierarchical clustering is popular in the submis-sions.
Moreover, we find that weight learning isvery crucial for similarity matrix, which has a bigimpact to the final clustering performance.
Be-sides the popular Boolean and TFIDF weightingschemes, SoochowHY and NEU-2 use differentweighting learning.
NEU-2 manually assignsweights to different kinds of features.
So-ochowHY develops an algorithm that iterativelylearns a weight for a character-based n-gram.5 ResultsWe first provide the performances of the formaltest, and make some analysis.
We then present anddiscuss the performances of the diagnosis test.5.1 Results of the Formal testFor the formal test, we show the performances of11 submissions from 10 teams in Table 2.
Foreach team, we keep only the better result exceptthe NEU team because they use different tech-nologies in their two submissions (NEU_1 andNEU_2).From Table 2, we first observe that 7 submis-sions perform better than the hybrid cheat system.In contrast, in Artiles et al (2009), only 3 teamscan beat the hybrid system.
From our analysis,this may attribute to the following facts.1) Personal name disambiguation on Chinesemay be easier than the one on English.
Forexample, one of key issues in personal namedisambiguation is to capture the occurrencesof a query name in text.

More efforts areput on the exploration directly on disam-biguation, not on text pre-processing.
Fur-thermore, most of systems extract featuresbased on some popular NLP techniques, suchas Chinese word segmentation, named entityrecognition and POS tagger.
As those toolsusually are developed based on news corpora,they should extract high-quality features fordisambiguation in our task.We then notice that the NEU team achieves thebest performance.
From their system description,we find that they make some special processingjust for this task.
For example, they develop a per-sonal name recognition system to detect the occur-rences of a query name in a news article, and acascaded clustering for different kinds of persons.5.2 Results of the Diagnosis testWe present the performances of 8 submissions forthe diagnosis test from 7 teams in Table 3 as theformat of Table 2.
Meanwhile, we use the word-segment system as the baseline.Comparing Table 2 and 3, we first find that theword-segment system has a lower performancethan the hybrid cheat system although the word-segment system is more useful for real applica-tions.
This implies the importance to develop anappropriate evaluation method for clustering.From Table 3, five submissions achieve betterperformances than the word-segment system.Given the gold-standard word segmentation onpersonal names in the diagnosis test, from Table 3,our total impression is that the top systems takeless advantages, and the bottom systems takemore.
This indicates that bottom systems sufferfrom their low-quality word segmentation andnamed entity detection.
For example,BUPT_pris01 increases ~22% F score (from52.81% to 74.25%).6 ConclusionsThis campaign follows the work of WePS, andexplores Chinese personal name disambiguationon news.
We examine two issues: one is for Chi-nese word segmentation, and the other is noisyinformation.
As Chinese word segmentation usu-ally is a pre-processing for most NLP processing,we investigate the impact of word segmentation todisambiguation.
To avoid noisy information fordisambiguation, such as HTML tags in webpageused in WePS, we choose news article to work onso that we can capture how good the state-of-the-art disambiguation technique is.ReferencesArtiles, Javier, Julio Gonzalo and Satoshi Sekine.2007.The SemEval-2007 WePS Evaluation: Establishinga benchmark for the Web People Search Task.
