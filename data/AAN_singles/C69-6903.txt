IbyPaul SchveigerWe start with Chomsky's definition of the lexical entryas the whole of the phonological, semantic and syntactic distinc-tive features.
This definition is interpreted matricially.
Theiexical entry's matrix contains semantic re ferrences  to the senseand signification of the linguistic objects - the words.Introducing the matrixes of the lexical entries - whichare grouped in a senSence - in its (the sentence's) matrix, westudy vectorially the elements of the structural description(the Dase component and the Transformational component of theGrammar).
The different gra~natical and semantic categories -which determine the relations in the sentence - have differentvectors (theoretically the vectors are of unitary dimension andare considered as free and s i tuated in  the same plane) in thesystem of calculus.In short is dealt also with the problem of referentials:but this problem is not solved exhaustively.
