In this poster we describe the elements of the annota-tion schema and provide results of an initial annotation study on a document set compris-ing six different types of clinical reports.1 Introduction Distinguishing between historical and recent con-ditions is important for most tasks involving re-trieval of patients or extraction of information from textual clinical records.
Various approaches can be used to determine whether a condition is historical or recent.
Chapman et al (2007) developed an al-gorithm called ConText that uses trigger terms like ?history?
to predict whether a condition is histori-cal.
Studies of ConText show that this approach is inadequate for determining whether a condition is historical, achieving recall of 67% and precision 74% on emergency department reports.
Temporal modeling methods commonly reason about the temporality of an event with respect to absolute time and other temporally related events (Zhou et al, 2006; Chambers et al, 2007).
Knowing the relative or absolute time the condition occurred can be useful in determining whether the condition is historical.
However, we hypothesize that many clinical conditions in clinical reports are not modi-fied by explicit temporal references.
To test this hypothesis and explore other types of information that may be useful in automatically distinguishing historical from recent clinical condi-tions in dictated clinical records, we developed a temporal annotation schema that accounts for ex-plicit temporal expressions, temporal trigger terms,and clinical reporting acts described in reports.
Three annotators applied the schema to six types of reports.
We measured inter-annotator agreement scores and obtained prevalence and distribution figures for the three annotation types.2 Methods 2.1 Dataset Our dataset is comprised of 24 clinical reports of six types dictated at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center during 2007: discharge summaries, surgical pathology, radiology, echocardiograms, operative gastrointestinal, and emergency depart-ment reports.
A physician pre-annotated the 518 clinical conditions in the reports and marked each one as recent or historical.
We developed our annotation schema using one of each report type (six reports).
Annotators (authors HH, DM and WC) annotated the remain-ing 18 reports as described below.
2.2 Annotation Schema  For our temporal annotation study, each pre-annotated clinical condition was annotated with three types of information: temporal expression, trigger term, and clinical reporting act.
The set of temporal expressions (TEs) is taken from Zhou et al (2006) and includes categories such as DATE AND TIME for explicit TEs and KEY EVENTS for TEs relative to significant clinical events.
A given clinical condition is annotated with the category of the TE it is modified by.
For exam-ple, in the sentence ?The stroke occurred on 1/5/2000?, the condition ?stroke?
is annotated with category DATE AND TIME.
There is also a category NO TEMPORAL EXPRESSION for annotating condi-tions that are not linked to a TE.
Trigger terms (TTs) are explicit signals (words and phrases) in text other than TEs that indicate106whether a condition is recent or historical (Chap-man et al, 2007).
If a condition co-occurs with a TT, it is annotated with TRIGGER: YES.
For exam-ple, ?pneumonia?
in the sentence ?Films indicate pneumonia, which is new for this patient?
is anno-tated as TRIGGER: YES because ?new?
is a TT.
Error analyses of our previous studies indicate that the context in which a condition is mentioned in a report is potentially useful for prediction of a condition as recent or historical.
Clinical reports consist of statements that group into segments ac-cording to the clinical reporting act (CRA) they describe, such as noting a past history and consid-ering a diagnosis.
CRAs are tightly correlated with report sections; however, sections are not consis-tent, and different CRAs can occur within a single section.
We distinguish 16 CRAs.
Each clinical condition is annotated with one CRA.
For exam-ple, the condition ?smoker?
in the sentence ?She was a smoker?
is annotated SOCIAL HISTORY.
2.3 Analysis  To establish the level of inter-annotator agreement, we iteratively annotated groups of six reports (one of each type).
After each iteration, we refined our annotation schema and guidelines.
We analyzed annotations, overall and by report type, in the fol-lowing way: 1) calculate inter-annotator kappa score, 2) measure prevalence of TT and TE catego-ries, and 3) observe distribution of CRAs.
3 Results and Discussion As shown in figure 1, average inter-annotator scores as measured by Cohen's kappa for TE, TT, and CRA (.68, .82 and .72 respectively) reached acceptable levels after three iterations and are ex-pected to rise further with increased annotation experience and understanding of the guidelines.
Table 1 shows the prevalence of TEs and TTs across six report types, where prevalence is defined as the frequency of TE or TT found in a given re-port.
Use of TEs across report types ranged from 0% to 52% whereas TTs were found less often at 0% to 34% by report genre.
Table 2 plots the cor-relation between the CRA assigned to a clinical condition and the condition's classification as re-cent or historical.
We found that there is a strong correlation for the most commonly occurring clini-cal reporting acts (PH, PR, and PO).
We are there-fore optimistic that CRAs can serve as aninformative feature for a statistical recent/historical classifier.kappa011 2 3i t e r a t i o nTETTCRAFigure 1.

The finding that many conditions are associated with neither a TE nor a TT and study of ConText?s limitations with such categories at the scope of the sentence suggests that additional features are nec-essary to discern a condition as recent or historical.
Whereas temporality in discourse may follow a sequential chronology as narrative unfolds, refer-ences to past instances within clinical text are not easily resolved.
We are optimistic that CRAs may help this issue and will focus our study to evaluate whether these three features are sufficient together.
