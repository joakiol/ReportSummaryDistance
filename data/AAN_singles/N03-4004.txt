TAP-XL: An Automated Analyst?s AssistantSean Colbath, Francis KubalaBBN Technologies, 10 Moulton Street, Cambridge, MA 02138scolbath@bbn.com, fkubala@bbn.comAbstractThe TAP-XL Automated Analyst?s Assistant isan application designed to help an English-speaking analyst write a topical report, cullinginformation from a large inflow of multi-lingual, multimedia data.
It gives users theability to spend their time finding more datarelevant to their task, and gives themtranslingual reach into other languages byleveraging human language technology.1 System DescriptionThe TAP-XL system exploits language technology tomonitor the user?s interactions with the system andprovide suggestions of relevant information to analysts,maximizing time spent reading relevant documents andwriting reports.
Any document, passage, or fact that auser saves in a report is deemed to be valuable, and theTAP-XL system then proactively suggests relatedinformation that is located in the stream of documents.Rather than force the user to learn a suite of distincttools, this ?suggestion?
metaphor is employedthroughout TAP-XL: all language technologies pulltogether to bring value to the user through data, ratherthan via additional tools, interfaces, and metaphors thatmust be learned separately.2 Use ModelThe user interacts with the TAP-XL system via atraditional word processor (Microsoft Word), with anadditional web-based user interface.The user writes a report based on an initial problemstatement.
The problem statement includes names ofpeople, locations, and organizations relevant to a topic,as well as hypotheses about events involving theseentities that are to be corroborated or refuted in thereport.Suggestions appear in a window to the left of theword processor.
The initial set of suggestions isgenerated from the text of the problem statement.
Eachsuggestion leads to a document or collection of docu-ments.
Passages from a document deemed relevant bythe user can be cited in the report via a ?create citation?button.
This places the selected excerpt in the report,along with a hyperlink to the original source document.It also triggers the TAP-XL system to provide additionalsuggestions relevant to the passage the user selected, aswell as documents relevant to any entities included inthe citation.
Suggestions deemed not relevant can bedeleted.
A screenshot of the TAP-XL system in use maybe seen in Figure 1.In addition to the suggestion mechanism, users mayemploy a traditional keyword-based query mechanismto locate documents in the system.The process of system suggestion ?
citation ?additional suggestions results in a feedback loopbetween the TAP-XL system and the user?s report.
Thisfeedback loop is designed to allow many differenthuman-language technologies to contribute relevantinformation to the user.3 System ArchitectureThe analytical portion of TAP-XL is a distributed,component-based system.
Components include MachineTranslation (Arabic to English), Document Clustering,Multi-document Summarization, and Fact Extraction.The components are distributed across the Internet,using a custom web service technology called the TAPConnector.
The TAP Connector uses industry-standardweb protocols to communicate between a requester anda provider, allowing distributed computation across theInternet with unpredictable data flows and latencies.All metadata produced by the components is stored ina central data repository, making it available to otherdownstream technologies.The system currently processes approximately 1,000English newswire documents per day from acommercial source, as well as 150 documents per dayfrom Arabic newspapers, obtained via web harvesting.All Arabic documents are translated to English viaMachine Translation.
The total flow of documents isthen exposed to all the other downstream technologies(Fact Extraction, Document Clustering, and Multi-document Summarization).Edmonton, May-June 2003Demonstrations , pp.

TAP-XL System in Use4 Recent DevelopmentsThe TAP-XL system has been under development sinceNovember of 2002, and was recently used by more than12 analysts in an Integrated Feasibility Experiment(IFE) under the DARPA TIDES program.
The results ofthis IFE will be used to guide future enhancements ofthe TAP-XL system, including user interfaceenhancements, use model improvements, and additionallanguage component technology.5 ReferencesFrancis Kubala, Sean Colbath, Daben Liu, AmitSrivastava, and John Makhoul.
