P.Larousse9#241 Malakoff - FranceABSIPACTThis paper describes an implemented utoring system (2),designed to help students to generate clitic-constmctions i  French.While showing various ways of converting a given meaning structureinto i ts  corresponding surface expression, tbe system helps not on-ly to discover what data to process but also h~_~ this informationprocessing should take_place.
In other words, we are concerned withefficiency in verbal planning (performance).Recognizing that the same result can be obtained by variousmethods, the student should find out ~dch one is best suited tothe circumstances (what is kr~n, task demands etc.
).
Infon~atio-hal states, hence the preeesser's needs, may vary to a great ex-tent, as may his strategies or cognitive styles.
In consequence, inorder to become an efficient processor, flu student }\]as to acquirenot only S\]RUCilRa_ or RULE-KNOWLEDGE but also PROCEDLI~-~_EIX~(skill).With this in mind we have designed three modules in orderto foster a reflective, experimental ttitude in the learner, hel-ping him to discover insightfully the ,Dst efficient strategy.i .
~T IONIt is well known that the same output can be achieved byseveral methods.
For example, a given set of sentences or texts canbe generated by a variety of equivalent but different grammars.Any of U~se grammars can be used in numerous ways.Grammars are generally noutra\] with respect to processing(3).
They pertain only to competence and performance factors suchas memory load, focus of attention, etc.
lie out of their scope.lh3oc~\] different granmars may be equivalent in terms of their pro-duct -they a l l  produce the same result, i.e.
the same set of sen-fences- they certainly d i f fer  in te,~ns of the processing, that isto say in terms of their  relative efficiency (speed, memory load,etc.
).Whereas most scholars werking in the domain of generationde not deal with strategies (4) -they consider but one way to reachthe solution- ~e will be concerned by the procedural inlolicationsof using a given gra, mar in a variety of ways.Instead of having co,loeting grammars, we will take one ofthem (5) and l~elate its efficiency to the way it is used.
\]\]\]is per-fotmanoe-orionted approadl seems just i f ied on theoretical as wellas on practical grounds (economy and f lex ib i l i ty  of processing).Let us take, for example, a student who ~uld  l ike to be-cone fluent in French.
Obviously, he would have to learn not onlywhat to process, but also how to process in order to ef f ic ient lyconver t  a given meaning (conceptual graph) into i t s  correspondingexpression (seetenee).
In oN~er werds, our student has to learnnot only a set of gcammatical rules but also a set of strateqiesor operating principles (6) powerful and f lexible enough to getfrom a given input (meaning) to the output (sentence) in the mosteconomic way, i.e.
with the fewest operations, with the least sto-rage, and wiN\] the minimum amount of transformations.2.
PROCE55, FUNCTION OF STRUCTL~:I t  is  a well known fact that students learning French have di f -f ienl t ies  in producing fluently sentences with 2 pronoun ccmplomentssuch as:Dis-le moi V-OO-lO Tell me (tell me it)Ne le lui dis pas!
neg-DO-lO-V-neg Don't el l  him (that)!I i  te le donnora S-IO-DO-V He'l l  (.live i t  to youIi le lui deonera S-DO-IO-V He'll give it to himJe te pr6sente ~ elle S-DO-V-prep-lO I ' I i  pres~\]te you to herI t  is interesting to find out why these constructions are sod i f f i cu l t  to learn and to process.
We believe that there are threebasic reasons for this:i) the structural idiesyneraeies oF the French system:mor~\]ology and syntax are interdep~ant;2) the procedural implications of this structure:many morphemes have an embedded structure (see below);3) the resource limitations of the l~mn processor:being a serial processor, the learnor can focus his attentionon but one thing at a time.2.1 STRUCIIP#~ PARTICIIARITIES:French pronoun constructions are complicated because syntaxand morphology are interrelated, form as well as position dependingupon each other.
Their generation implies that one is capable ofdete~nLning at least three things:- the fom\] of a given referent:for example, the concepts SPEAKER or 3d PERSON can be realizedin any of the following forms:SPEAKER: je, me, moi3d PERSON: i l ,  e\].le, ils, dies, on, se, sol,le, la, ies, lu i ,  lent, cux;- its position:In the affinnative mode there are three positions or sentence-frames:a) 5-10-DO-V i l  me le pr4sente (he presents him to me)b) S-DO--IO-V i l  l-e lui  pr4sente (he presents him to her)c) S-DO-V---prep-I_O0 i l  me ~sonte  ~ elle(he presents me to her)- ~letber the preposition, inherent in the base, should be madeexplicit or not.
As the examples (b) and (c) clearly show, thesame verbeonstmction may or may not require elision of the pre-position.
Either one affects form as ~ell as position (7).It should be noted that while most verbs allow only for twopatterns in the.
declarative mode ('a' and 'b'), those with an ani-mate object such as 'pr6scnter' (to present) allow also for 'c'.5662.2 I-I~OCE1)LI~L \]M~tICATION~:~tm l i r~dst tc  constraints operate on a l l  levels: phono\].~ji-caI,  mrphol(~jical and syntact.i.cal.a) H~onoloqi~il constraints:lhe detemdnation of ~)rpbology general ly requires three ope-rat ions (porsen, case, nLraber and so~Keimes gender), yet: pronounsare n~nosyl.labie.
\]in c~isequencc, one cannot plan tl~ i~xt pronounwhile uttering tl~ eut'rc~lt one as the pronoun uttered is ton shortand the time needed for planning the next ~e being too long.b)  Morphological.
om~straints:There are number of cases where the indirect object has anembedded structure, i.e.
U~.
morl~ology of' the indirect object d e-p~Js upon information cx~dng from the direct ~_~t  (8).
This im-plies intercupLion of a routine.
Suppose that the sentence:3d~ presents Paul to Maryi s  to be.
prononinalized.
Tile problem is  ttk~ detemdnat i~ of formand position of Lt~ prc~)nos, referr ing respect ively to "Paul" ar~Jto "Mary".
The indi rect  ob~ (Mary) lex ica l i zes  e i ther  as LUIor as EI?E, dopending upon ~,ther  the direct  ~ .
(Paul) rcl)re-sents the sgeaker / l i s ter~r  or a 3d person, in th i s  la t te r  ense (e)the verb follows the indirect object, va~ereas in the forrmr (d) i.tprecedes it.
(d) il me prgsenbe ~ EI_LE (he presents ~m to her)(e) il le LUI pr4sento (he presents him to her)e) 5Vntactical constraints:lhe l i r~r  order of tile corlstitoents carl general ly not beestablished, u~til both objects are known.
In cons~ce,  at leastone of the.
t~o elements bas to be stored in werkLng nmmory.
(f)  i.1 le \]ui  donne he give~s i t  to him (S-DO-IO-V)(g) i l  me ie donne he gives i t  to me (S-IO-DO-V)Suppose that the.
direct  object has been processed right af-ter U~ subject.
In that ease one I<nows its form but not tlcce~sa-rily its position ('f' or 'g ') .
This latter de~x~nds upon the vah~of the indirect object.
If U~ indirect object is in tlm first orsecond person it precedes the dit'ect objeet (g), otherwise i t  Pol-.lows i t  ( f ) .
Should ~e start by processing the indirect object be-fore the direct one, we might have to keep tl~e fommr in workingmemory, lhis is precisely the case of "f" ~ere the indirect ob-ject is in U~e third person and not tmflexive.
As one can see, inbeth sih~tions one is faced with unwanted storage problems.Obviously these structural particularities of tlm Frend~pron(xm system have implication~ not only for U~e process of lear-ning but also for the process of generation, namely:they exclude any ~ord-to-word processing, andthey *~@Jire a certain amount of prepl~dng orl ook -a lg ld .~lat is needed tl~n, in order tO avoid false starts or cor-reetions (bad<tracking), i.s global planninc~ on Um clause levelrat)mr than local pl.annlnc~ on the word level.In the light of tl~-~se facts one has to ad~t that gm tree-ration of p ro~m constructions in Frend~ is i~ot all that simple.Althe~jh the relevant features (rules) are simple in nature, theirinteraction is highly conlolex.
It is U~s not surprising that stu-dents take a \].ong t i .~  to understand al l  U~ i n t r i cac ies  of thesystem, ~ ieh  would allow U~-ml eventually to integrate the rulesinto an eff ic ient  prccess-modei.3.

SOC~IIC IvE~OD:The system guides the student in the form of a dialogue,by ~lowing him ~hat and }low to process in order to get from aninput to the outpuC.

)\]he qualities of this socratic dialogue \].ie in the visuali-zation of the whole process.
The system demonstrates which infor-mation should be processed and in what order.
I t  also shows under~hat conditions movement of constituents are necessary.
These per'-mutations are g~own on the screen, so that the user can learn ~dehfeatures control those movements.
Furthermore, the results of theprocessed date are shown on-line, i.e.
the form and position ofthe ~ord determined are shown instantaneously.
Finally the systemtells ~hether the newly determined item can be articulated rightaway or not.
The system is thus explicit with respect to ruleknowledge and optimal in temm of processing.
The result is ob-tained in the most economic way.The disadvantage of this sys~-dr ivm processing reside inthe fact that the solution, or more precisely, the method used toarrive at the solution, is shown but not discovered.
Moreover, on-ly one method is considered, hence the procedural knowledge remainsimplicit.
Tim student will not even envisage other methods.
He maythus know how to convert meaning into sentences, bat this knowledgebeing implicit, he will not know how to transfer it to other si-tuations.5,2  GUIDED DISCOVERYThe system s t i l l  controls the nature of the operations but nolonger controls their order.
The latter is controlled, via stra-tegies, by the user.
He decides in what order to process tlm data,Having determined the subject, whose positions is  invariable, onecan choose from three strategies:- a syntactical one (syntactic-driven processing),- and two morphological ones (le~ical-ddven processing).If priority is given to syntax, no reordering of constituentsis meant to take place, i.e.
all information pertaining to ~rdorder is processed.
The result  is an ordered eategoriai structureor syntactical frame (h) @rich wil l  be f i l led in by the merpholo-gicai values determined later (i),  for ex~lole:he gives i t  to her(h )  sentence frame: Stl3~CT - DI~CT OBfCT - IN ) ,  0B~CT - VERB(i) morpholo9~: i l  le lu i  - donne568I f  pr ior ity is given to morphelogy (lexically-driven generation),the form is determined before U~e relative order of the constituentelemeats.
In this ease two strategies are possible: either one pro-eesses the direct or the iodi.rect object.The efficiency of these three strategies is of course not thesame.
It is precisely the user's task to find out whidl of thesestrategies is tlm most efficient.
The system invites him to comparethese methods by applying certain performance cr i ter ia:- oumher of steps necessary to generate the sentence,- what is kno~ when ?
(form/position),- congruence of inpet/output order (are permutations necessary?LIFO/FIFO)- are there any conceptual disruptions ?
(9)This experimental method should make the student aware of thefact that several strategies can be used to arrive at the solution.Ha should compare them with respect o certain cr i ter ia  and reachhis conclusions.5.3  USER DRI~_N EtPERIMENTATION:This method, l ike the previous one, is empirical.
By playingwith the system the student may gain certain insights about pro-cessing order,A matrix appears on the screen, ~ose blank spaces have to bef i l led in by the student.
The herizontal l ine ~lows the syntacticinformation given with tim input (verb, subject, object, preposi-tion), -more inforfmltion is needed about those elements- tlm vert i -cal line shows the nature of the information necessary to arriveat the output.Thus the processing once again consists of tlm specificationof the values of a llst of attributes.
However there is a funda-mental differences between this approach and tlm former, namely,the system has an inference mechanism.
Each item of informationgiven to the system is considered for its meaning potential, i.e.the system tr ies to fi.nd out whether some new facts can be inferredfrom the old fact.I t  should be noted that the inference power varies with thenature of the data as ~ l l  as with their  order, lhere are eases~mre a single fact enables 3 other faet~ to he deduced (reflexives).A given inference ,my allow further deductions (inference-chain,knowledge propagation).
This has of course an effect on Um process,tamely, tim greater the inference power, the greater tlm ecmowof precessing.
This speaks for the following operating principle:the greater the inference power of a given pieceof information, tim ear l ier  i t  should be processed.\]his method is interesting in that, by testing different itemsand different order~ it makes possible to watch on the screen whichitems allow what inferences.
Sinee those inferences depend uponthe nature of the input as ~ell  as on tim moment at ~hieh that in-formation is  given, we believe that th is  module is particularlyuseful in helping discover the best possible order of processing.Furthermore we think that this method has another virtue, na-mely that i t  can simulate l i te ra l l y  any knowledge state, thus me-king i t  possible, by experimental means to disoover the shortestpath bet~en a given information state (input) and the solution(output).6.

There are a few exceptions like Robinson's (1975), Carrol's(1980) or I<ml0en &Fbenk~'s (1982) approad~.#o See for  example: Davey (1978), Mc Donald (1983), Mc i<eo~)(1982), Mann (1983), Sewa (\]983), Danlos (1985).5 ?
Oar gr~m~r is  basically a lexical-functional grammar (seeKay, 1979)6 ?
~Dng those operating principles are the following:- avoid disruptions by grouping together ~at  belongs c~ep-tual ly toge~r ;- start  with the most informative items(feature hierarchy: PERS~, CASE_, NLM~R, GE~I~_R);- avoid unnecessary storage - start  wi.th the le f i~st  item.7 ?
lhe fact that prepositions have marphological reflexes hasbeen readily recognized by l inguists.
~at  has not been sho~ate the conditions under which a preposition has to be expli-cited or not, but that is  the kind of knowledge a speaker musthave.8 ?
This is generally r~t made xp l ic i t  in l ingeist lc  descriptions.9 ?
