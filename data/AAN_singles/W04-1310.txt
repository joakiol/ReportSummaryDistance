69On a possible role for pronouns in the acquisition of verbsAarre Laakso and Linda SmithDepartment of Psychology1101 E. 10th StreetBloomington, IN 47408{alaakso,smith4}@indiana.eduAbstractGiven the restrictions on the subjects andobjects that any given verb may take, it seemslikely that children might learn verbs partlyby exploiting statistical regularities in co-occurrences between verbs and noun phrases.Pronouns are the most common NPs in thespeech that children hear.
We demonstratethat pronouns systematically partition severalimportant classes of verbs, and that a simplestatistical learner can exploit theseregularities to narrow the range of possibleverbs that are consistent with an incompleteutterance.
Taken together, these resultssuggest that children might use regularities inpronoun/verb co-occurrences to help learnverbs, though whether this is actually soremains a topic for further research.1 IntroductionPronouns stand for central elements of adultconceptual schemes?as Quine pointed out,pronouns ?are the basic media of reference?
(Quine, 1980, p. 13).
In fact, most syntacticsubjects in spontaneous spoken adult discourseare pronouns (Chafe, 1994), and English-speakingmothers often begin with a high-frequencypronoun when speaking to their children, with youand I occurring most frequently (e.g., Valian,1991).
Parents use the inanimate pronoun it farmore frequently as the subject of an intransitivesentence than of an transitive one (Cameron-Faulkner et al, 2003, p. 860).
As Cameron-Faulkner et al note, this suggests that intransitivesentences are used more often than transitives fortalking about inanimate objects.
It also suggests,we would note, that the use of the inanimatepronoun might be a cue for the child as to whetherthe verb is transitive or intransitive.
Similarly,Lieven and Pine (Lieven et al, 1997; Pine andLieven, 1993) have suggested that pronouns mayform the fixed element in lexically-specificframes acquired by early language learners?so-to-speak ?pronoun islands?
something likeTomasello?s (1992) ?verb islands.
?Many researchers have suggested that word-word relations in general, and syntactic framesspecifically, are particularly important forlearning verbs (e.g., Gleitman, 1990; Gleitmanand Gillette, 1995).
What has not been studied, toour knowledge, is how pronouns specifically mayhelp children learn verbs by virtue of systematicco-occurrences.
We have begun to address thisissue in two steps.
First, we measured thestatistical regularities among the uses of pronounsand verbs in a large corpus of parent and childspeech.
We found strong regularities in the use ofpronouns with several broad classes of verbs.Second, using the corpus data, we trained aconnectionist network to guess which verbbelongs in a sentence given only the subject andobject, demonstrating that it is possible inprinciple for a statistical learner to use theregularities in parental speech to deduceinformation about an unknown verb.2 Experiment 1The first experiment consisted of a corpusanalysis to identify patterns of co-occurrencebetween pronouns and verbs in the child?s input.2.1 MethodParental utterances from the CHILDESdatabase (MacWhinney, 2000) were coded forsyntactic categories, then subjected to clusteranalysis.
The mean age of target childrenrepresented in the transcripts that were coded forthis experiment was 3;0 (SD1;2).2.1.1 MaterialsThe following corpora were used: Bates, Bliss,Bloom 1970, Brown, Clark, Cornell, DemetrasWorking, Gleason, Hall, Higginson, Kuczaj,MacWhinney, Morisset, New England, Post,Sachs, Suppes, Tardiff, Valian, Van Houten, VanKleeck and Warren-Leubecker.
Coding wasperformed using a custom web application thatrandomly selected transcripts, assigned them tocoders as they became available, collected coding70input, and stored it in a MySQL database.
Theapplication occasionally assigned the sametranscript to all coders, in order to measurereliability.
Five undergraduate coders were trainedon the coding task and the use of the system.2.1.2 ProcedureEach coder was presented, in sequence, witheach main tier line of each transcript she wasassigned, together with several lines of context;the entire transcript was also available by clickinga link on the coding page.
For each line, sheindicated (a) whether the speaker was a parent,target child, or other; (b) whether the addresseewas a parent, target child, or other; (c) thesyntactic frames of up to 3 clauses in theutterance; (d) for each clause, up to 3 subjects,auxiliaries, verbs, direct objects, indirect objectsand obliques.
Because many utterances weremulti-clausal, the unit of analysis for assessingpronoun-verb co-occurrences was the clauserather than the utterance.The syntactic frames were: no verb, question,passive, copula, intransitive, transitive andditransitive.
These were considered to be mutuallyexclusive, i.e., each clause was tagged asbelonging to one and only one frame, according towhich of the following frames it matched first: (1)The no verb frame included clauses ?
such as?Yes?
or ?OK?
?
with no main verb.
(2) Thequestion  frame included any clause using aquestion word ?
such as ?Where did you go??
?
orhaving inverted word order ?
such as ?Did you goto the bank??
?
but not merely a question mark ?such as ?You went to the bank??
(3) The passiveframe included clauses in the passive voice, suchas ?John was hit by the ball.?
(4) The copulaframe included clauses with the copula as themain verb, such as ?John is angry.?
(5) Theintransitive frame included clauses with no directobject, such as ?John ran.?
The transitive frameincluded clauses with a direct object but noindirect object, such as ?John hit the ball.?
(6) Theditransitive  frame included clauses with anindirect object, such as ?John gave Mary a kiss.
?All nouns were coded in their singular forms,whether they were singular or plural (e.g., ?boys?was coded as ?boy?
), and all verbs were coded intheir infinitive forms, whatever tense they were in(e.g., ?ran?
was coded as ?run?
).In total, 59,977 utterances were coded from 123transcripts.
All of the coders coded 7 of thosetranscripts for the purpose of measuringreliability.
Average inter-coder reliability(measured for each coder as the percentage ofitems coded exactly the same way they werecoded by each other coder) was 86.1%.
Given thenumber of variables, the number of levels of eachvariable (3 speakers, 3 addressees, 7 frames, and 6syntactic relations), and the number of coders (5),the probability of chance agreement is very low.Although there are some substantive errors(usually with complex embedded clauses or otherunusual constructions), many of the discrepanciesare simple spelling mistakes or failures to trimwords to their roots.We only considered parental child-directedspeech (PCDS), defined as utterances where thespeaker was a parent and the addressee was atarget child.
A total of 24,286 PCDS utteranceswere coded, including a total of 28,733 clauses.More than a quarter (28.36%) of the PCDSclauses contained no verb at all; these wereexcluded from further analysis.
Clauses that werequestions (16.86%), passives (0.02%), andcopulas (11.86%) were also excluded from furtheranalysis.
The analysis was conducted using onlyclauses that were intransitives (17.24% of totalPCDS clauses), transitives (24.36%) orditransitives (1.48%), a total of 12,377 clauses.2.2 ResultsThe most frequent nouns in the corpus?bothsubjects and objects?are pronouns, as shown inFigures 1 and 2.
The objects divided the mostcommon verbs into three main classes: verbs thattake the pronoun it and concrete nouns as objects,verbs that take complement clauses, and verbsthat take specific concrete nouns as objects.
Thesubjects divided the most common verbs into fourmain classes: verbs whose subject is almostalways I, verbs whose subject is almost alwaysyou, verbs that take I or you almost equally assubject, and other verbs.
The verbs divided themost common object nouns into a number ofclasses, including objects of telling and lookingverbs, objects of having and wanting verbs, andobjects of putting and getting verbs.
The verbsalso divided the most common subject nouns intoa number of classes, including subjects of havingand wanting verbs, and subjects of thinking andknowing verbs.05001000150020002500youI we it he theyshethatwhatMommyFigure 1: The 10 most frequent subjects in PCDSby their number of occurrences710200400600800100012001400(clause)it thatyouthemonewhatthismehimFigure 2:  The 10 most frequent objects in PCDSby their number of occurrences.2.2.1 Verbs that take it as an objectThe verbs that take it as their most commonobject include verbs of motion and transfer, asshown in Table 1.2.2.2 Verbs that take complement clausesMost verbs that did not take it as their mostcommon object instead took complement clauses.These are primarily psychological verbs, as shownin Table 2.2.2.3 Verbs that take concrete nouns as objectsMost remaining verbs in the corpus took uniquesets of objects.
For example, the most commonobject used with read was book, followed by itand story; the most common object used with playwas game, followed by it, block, and house.2.2.4 Verbs that take I as a subjectVerbs whose most common subject is I includebet (23 out of 23 uses with a subject, or 100%),guess (21/22, 95.4%), think (212/263, 80.6%), andsee (95/207, 45.9%).

These verbs are being usedto indicate the deontic status of a subsequentclause, including disposition or inclination,volition, and compulsion.2.2.6 Verbs that take you or I as a subjectVerbs that take I and you more or less equallyas subject include mean (15 out of 32 uses, or46.9%, with I and 12 of 32 uses, or 37.5%, withyou), know  (I: 159/360, 44.2%; you: 189/360,52.5%), and remember  (I: 9/23, 39.1%; you:12/23, 52.2%).Verb Total it (#) it (%)turn 56 33 58.9throw 36 20 55.5push 25 13 52.0hold 42 19 45.2break 36 16 44.4leave 27 12 44.4open 36 15 41.7do 256 105 41.0wear 25 10 40.0take off 24 9 37.5put 276 93 33.7get 348 74 21.3take 106 22 20.8put on 42 8 19.0buy 50 9 18.0give 85 14 16.5have 340 26 7.6Table 1: Verbs most commonly used withobject it.Verb Total <clause>(#)<clause>(%)think 187 179 95.7remember 31 23 74.2let 78 57 73.1know 207 141 68.1ask 29 17 58.6go 55 32 58.2want 317 183 57.7mean 25 14 56.0tell 115 45 39.1try 51 18 35.3say 175 53 30.3look 48 14 29.2need 64 18 28.1see 266 73 27.4like 123 32 26.0show 36 9 25.0make 155 23 14.8Table 2:  Verbs most commonly used withcomplement clauses.Verb Total I (#) I (%) you(#)you(%)bet 23 23 100 0 0guess 22 21 95.4 0 0think 263 212 80.6 38 14.4see 207 95 45.9 50 24.1mean 32 15 46.9 12 37.5know 360 159 44.2 189 52.5remember 23 9 39.1 12 52.2like 134 20 14.9 86 64.2want 270 34 12.6 192 71.1need 65 5 7.7 33 50.8Table 3:  Some verbs commonly used withsubject I or you.722.2.7 Objects of tell and look atThe objects me, us, Daddy and Mommy formeda cluster in verb space, appearing frequently withthe verbs tell and look at.2.2.8 Objects of put and getThe objects one, stuff, box, and toy occurredmost frequently with get, and frequently with put.The objects them, h i m, h e r , bed, and mouthoccurred most frequently with put and, in somecases, also frequently with get.2.2.9 Objects of have and wantThe objects cookie, some, money, coffee, milk,and ju ice  formed a cluster in verb space,appearing frequently with verbs such as have andwant, as well as, in some cases, give, take, pour,drink, and eat.2.2.10 Subjects of think and knowThe subject I appeared most frequently with theverbs think and know.2.3 DiscussionAlthough pronouns are semantically ?light,?their particular referents determinable only fromcontext, they may nonetheless be potent forces onearly lexical learning by statistically pointing tosome classes of verbs as being more likely thanothers.
The results of Experiment 1 clearly showthat there are statistical regularities in the co-occurrences of pronouns and verbs that the childcould use to discriminate classes of verbs.Specifically, when followed by it, the verb islikely to describe physical motion, transfer, orpossession.
When followed a relatively complexcomplement clause, by contrast, the verb is likelyto attribute a psychological state.
Finerdistinctions may also be made with other objects,including proper names and nouns.
Verbsfollowed by me, us, Daddy, and Mommy are likelyto have to do with telling or looking.
Verbsfollowed by one, stuff, them, him, or her are likelyto have to do with getting or putting.
Verbsfollowed by certain concrete objects such ascookie, milk, or juice are likely to have to do withhaving or wanting.
Fine distinctions may also bemade according to subject.
If the subject is I, theverb is likely to have to do with thinking orknowing, whereas if the subject is you, she, we,he, or they, the verb is likely to have to do withhaving or wanting.
This regularity most likelyreflects the ecology of parents andchildren?parents ?know?
and children ?want?
?but it could nonetheless be useful indistinguishing these two classes of verbs.The results thus far show that there arepotentially usable regularities in the statisticalrelations between pronouns and verbs.
However,they do not show that these regularities can beused to cue the associated words.3 Experiment 2To demonstrate that the regularities in pronoun-verb co-occurrences in parental speech to childrencan actually be exploited by a statistical learner,we trained an autoassociator on the corpus data,then tested it on incomplete utterances to see howwell it would ?fill in the blanks?
when given onlya pronoun, or only a verb.
An autoassociator is aconnectionist network that is trained to take eachinput pattern and reproduce it at the output.
In theprocess, it compresses the pattern through a smallset of hidden units in the middle, forcing thenetwork to find the statistical regularities amongthe elements in the input data.
The network istrained by backpropagation, which iterativelyreduces the discrepancies between the network?sactual outputs and the target outputs (the same asthe inputs for an autoassociator).In our case, the inputs (and thus the outputs) aresubject-verb-object ?sentences.?
Once thenetwork has learned the regularities inherent in acorpus of complete SVO sentences, testing it onincomplete sentences (e.g., ?I ___ him?)
allows usto see what it has gleaned about the relationshipbetween the given parts (subject ?I?
and object?him?
in our example) and the missing parts (theverb in our example).3.1 Method3.1.1 DataThe network training data consisted of thesubject, verb, and object of all coded utterancesthat contained the 50 most common subjects,verbs and objects.
There were 5,835 suchutterances.
The inputs used a localist codingwherein there was one and only one input unit outof 50 activated for each subject, and likewise foreach verb and each object.
Absent and omittedarguments were counted among the 50, so, forexample, the utterance ?John runs?
would have 3units activated even though it only has 2words?the third unit being the ?no object?
unit.With 50 units each for subject, verb and object,there were a total of 150 input units to thenetwork.
Active input units had a value of 1, andinactive input units had a value of 0.3.1.2 Network ArchitectureThe network consisted of a two-layer 150-8-150unit autoassociator with a logistic activationfunction at the hidden layer and a three separatesoftmax activation functions (one each for thesubject, verb and object) at the output layer?see73Figure 3.
Using the softmax activation function,which ensures that all the outputs in the bank sumto 1, together with the cross-entropy errormeasure, allows us to interpret the networkoutputs as probabilities (Bishop, 1995).
Thenetwork was trained by the resilientbackpropagation algorithm (Riedmiller andBraun, 1993) to map its inputs back onto itsoutputs.
We chose to use eight units in the hiddenlayer on the basis of some pilot experiments thatvaried the number of hidden units.
Networks withfewer hidden units either did not learn theproblem sufficiently well or took a long time toconverge, whereas networks with more than about8 hidden units learned quickly but tended tooverfit the data.Figure 3:  Network architecture3.1.3 TrainingThe data was randomly assigned to two groups:90% of the data was used for training the network,while 10% was reserved for validating thenetwork?s performance.
Starting from differentrandom initial weights, five networks were traineduntil the cross-entropy on the validation setreached a minimum for each of them.
Trainingstopped after approximately 150 epochs oftraining, on average.
At that point, the networkswere achieving about 81% accuracy on correctlyidentifying subjects, verbs and objects from thetraining set.
Near perfect accuracy on the trainingset could have been achieved by further training,with some loss of generalization, but we wantedto avoid overfitting.3.1.4 TestingAfter training, the networks were tested withincomplete inputs corresponding to isolated verbsand pronouns.
For example, to see what a networkhad learned about it as a subject, it was tested witha single input unit activated?the onecorresponding to it as subject.
The other inputunits were set to 0.
Activations at the output unitswere recorded.
The results presented below reportaverage activations over all five networks.3.2 ResultsThe networks learn many of the co-occurrenceregularities observed in the data.
For example,when tested on the object it (see Figure 4 on page7 below), the most activated verbs are get, hold,take  and have , which are among the mostcommon verbs associated with it in the input (seeTable 1).
Similarly, tell, make  and say are themost activated verbs when networks are testedwith the clause  unit activated in the objectposition (figure not shown), and they are alsoamong the verbs most commonly associated witha clause in the input (see Table 2).However, the network does not merely learn therelative frequencies of pronouns with verbs.
Forexample, the verbs most activated by the subjectyou  are have  and get (see Figure 5 on page 8below), neither of which appears in Table 3.
Thereason for this, we believe, is that the subject youis strongly associated with the object it (note thestrong activation of it in the right column ofFigure 5), and the object it, as mentioned in theprevious paragraph, is strongly associated with theverbs h a v e  and get .
The difference may beobserved most clearly when the network isprompted simultaneously with you as the subjectand clause as the object (see Figure 6 on page 8below).
In that case, the verb want is stronglypreferred and, though get still takes second place,t e l l  and k n o w  rank third and fourth,respectively?consistent with the results in Table1.
This demonstrates that the network model issensitive to high-order correlations among wordsin the input, not merely the first-order correlationsbetween pronoun and verb occurrences.These results do not depend on using anautoassociation network, and we do not claim thatchildren in fact use an autoassociation architectureto learn language.
Any statistical learner that isable to discover higher-order correlations willproduce results similar to the ones shown here.
Anautoassociator was chosen only as a simple meansof demonstrating in principle that a statisticallearner can extract the statistical regularities fromthe data.4 ConclusionWe have shown that there are statisticalregularities in co-occurrences between pronounsand verbs in the speech that children hear fromtheir parents.
We have also shown that a simplestatistical learner can learn these regularities,including subtle higher-order regularities that arenot obvious in a casual glance at the input data,and use them to predict the verb in an incompletesentence.
How might this help children learn74verbs?
In the first place, hearing a verb framed bypronouns may help the child isolate the verbitself?having simple, short consistent, and high-frequency slot fillers could make it that mucheasier to segment the relevant word in frames like?He ___ it.?
Second, the information provided bythe particular pronouns that are used in a givenutterance might help the child isolate the relevantevent or action from the blooming, buzzingconfusion around it?in English, pronouns canindicate animacy, gender and number, and theirorder can indicate temporal or causal direction orsequence (e.g., ?You ___ it?
versus ?It ___ you?
).Finally, if we suppose that the child has alreadylearned one verb and its pattern of correlationswith pronouns, and then hears another verb beingused with the same or a similar pattern ofcorrelations, the child may hypothesize that theunknown verb is similar to the known verb.
Forexample, a child who understood ?want?
but not?need?
might observe that ?you?
is usually thesubject of both and conclude that ?want,?
like?need,?
has to do with his desires and not, forexample, a physical motion or someone else?sstate of mind.
The pronoun/verb co-occurrences inthe input may thus help the child narrow down theclass to which an unknown verb belongs, allowingthe learner to focus on further refining her graspof the verb through subsequent exposures.Whether children are actually sensitive to theseregularities remains an open question.
To theextent that children have actually picked up on theregularities, two predictions should follow.
Thefirst is that children?s utterances should exhibitroughly the same co-occurrence patterns as wefound in their parents?
speech to them.
Therefore,the next step in our research is to determinewhether children are using pronouns and verbstogether with roughly the same frequencies thatthey hear in their parents?
speech.
This is thesubject of research in progress using the codedcorpus data from Experiment 1.
Because ourhypothesis concerns broad-class verb acquisition,we are focusing on children younger than the ageof 3, by which time most children can produce themost common verbs (Dale and Fenson, 1996).The second prediction that follows from thehypothesis that children might be sensitive to theregularities demonstrated in this paper is thatchildren?s comprehension of ordinary verbsshould be better when they are used in frames thatare consistent with the regularities in the inputthan when they are used in frames that areinconsistent with those regularities.
Assessingwhether this is true requires an experiment testingchildren?s comprehension of real but relativelyinfrequent verbs in two conditions: a ?consistent?condition (in which the verb is used with nouns orpronouns that are consistent with the regularitiesin the corpus) and an ?inconsistent?
condition (inwhich the verb is used with nouns or pronounsthat are inconsistent with the regularities in thecorpus).
This experiment is in the planning stages.Even if children are sensitive to the regularities,this knowledge might not help them learn newverbs.
That is, whether these regularities actuallyplay a role in language acquisition also remains anopen question.
To the extent that they do, a thirdprediction follows: children should be better ableto generalize comprehension of novel verbs whenthey are presented in frames consistent with theseregularities.
We are designing an experiment totest this hypothesis.The argument that the frequency of pronounsand their co-occurrences with verb classes play arole in the acquisition of verbs could bestrengthened by showing that it is true in manylanguages.
The present study considered onlyEnglish, which is a relatively noun-heavylanguage in which argument ellipsis is rare.
Someother languages, by contrast, tend to emphasizeverbs and frequently drop nominal arguments.
Weare especially keen to find out what sorts of cueschildren might be using to identify verb classes insuch languages.
Hence, work is underway tocollect comparable data from Japanese and Tamil,verb-heavy languages with frequent argumentdropping and case-marked pronouns reflectingvarious degrees of social status.5 AcknowledgementsThis research was supported by NIMH grantnumber ROI MH 60200.
