Con-straints on world model elements erve as heuristics on thecooccurrence of lexical and other meanings in the text, facil-itating both natural anguage understanding and generation.Propositional meanings (defined in the lexicon in terms oflinks to the world model) trickle down to the text meaningrepresentation as instances of world model entities.
Our pri-mary objective in world modeling is to support multilingualapplications, o constructing a language-independent ontol-ogy is crucial.
The word sense view of ontology buildingleads to proliferation of concepts whenever words in differentlanguages do not "line-up" (see EDR 1990), while using acore set of "primitives" is limited for large-scale applications,if shades of meaning are to be captured.
In our environment,concept acquisition is guided by examining cross-linguisticevidence and representational trade-offs.
In other large-scaleontology projects, the separation of lexical from conceptualknowledge is not always clear, as in the Cyc project at MCC,a knowledge base containing millions of facts about he world(Lenat and Guha, 1990), or the KT system (Dahlgren, 1988),which classifies commonsense knowledge for English words.In the DIONYSUS project at CMU, the world model, the lex-icon and the text meaning representation are closely intercon-nected, in terms of their content and format.
World modelingis supported by the ONTOS system, which consists of a) a con-straint language, b) an ontology, or set of general concepts, c)a set of domain models and d) an intelligent knowledge acqui-sition interface.
The basic features of the ONTOS constraintlanguage are as follows (see Carlson & Nirenburg, 1990, fordetails).
A world model is a collection of frames.
A frameis a named set of slots, interpreted as an ontological concept(voluntary-olfactory-event, geopolitical-entity).
A slot rep-resents an ontological property (temperature, caused-by) andconsists of a named set of facets.
A facet is a named set offillers.
Facets refer to the status of property values, e.g.
:value actual values of property(e.g., for concept instances)default typical value of a propertysem set of"legal" values;akin to selectional restrictionsA filler is a symbol, number, range, etc.
A symbolic filler(prefixed by "*") names an ontological concept: (ALL (SUB-CLASSES (value *property *object *event))).2 Ontology Building in Context: ScalarAttributesIn the ONTOS system, a mechanism relating scalar attributes(AGE, TEMPERATURE) to measuring units (TEMPORAL-UNIT, THERMOMETRIC-UNIT) allows scalar informationto be converted into a standard format for interlingua rep-resentation.
The DOMAIN slot of a scalar attribute de-fines the types of concepts the attribute can describe.
In theATrRIBUTE-RANGE slot, the sem facet specifies an abso-lute constraint on the range of numerical values the attributecan have, while the measuring-unit facet designates a standardunit for interpreting the constraint:(AGE(DOMAIN (sem *object))(ATTRIBUTE-RANGE (sem (> 0))(measuring-unit *second) ) )Ontology building has never been a totally independentproject in our environment.
World knowledge in DIONYSUShas been acquired with the express purpose of using it in a nat-ural language processing system.
Knowledge representationrequirements of such a system include, in addition to ontol-ogy specification, a representation for a lexicon entry and alanguage for recording the meaning of input text.
The inter-action between these static knowledge sources and a naturallanguage analyzer is illustrated in Figure 1.World modeling decisions about scalar attributes are influ-enced by the way the lexicon is built and vice versa.
Inthe DIONYSUS system, relative scalar terms like very old,or high~low are not given a separate ontological status.
In-stead, lexical entries for such words are associated with on-tologically motivated constraints on scalar attributes.
Thelanguage-specific relationship between word-modifier and thelanguage-independent r lationship between concept-propertyis illustrated using the example of fresh-brewed coffee.
In theontology, the concept COFFEE appears as follows:(COFFEE(IS-A (value *beverage))(AGE (sem (> 0))(default (<> 0 4))(measuring-unit *hour)))The default facet of the AGE slot expresses a typical rangeof values for the age of COFFEE, which can be overridden, as2353.- .

The numbered links in the figure are interpreted in thefollowing manner, h ontological concepts are represented in theON'rOS constraint language.
2, 3, 4: portions of the ONTOS constraintlanguage, the lexicon entry formal and TAMERLAN are shared.
5:lcxical entries are represented in the lexicon entry format.
6, 7:lexical entries have pointers to information in TAMERLAN and/orinformation i  the ontology.
8: TAMERLAN is a formal anguage forrepresenting the meaning of NL texts.
9: source text is suppliedto the analyzer for processing.
10, 1 h part of the analysis processinvolves accessing and retrieving syntactic, semantic and pragmaticinformation storedin thelexicon.
12" theoutputofsemantic analysisis the representation f text meaning (interlingua text), expressed inTAMERLAN.long as the absolute constraint isnot violated.
The measuring-unit facet selects an appropriate measuring unit from the classTEMPORAL-UNIT.In the lexicon, the link between a word sense and an onto-logical concept is established in the SEM zone of an entry (seeMeyer et al 1990).
In the simplest case, there is a direct link,e.g., between the lexeme + c o f f e e -  n 2 (the sen se of coffee,the beverage), and the concept COFFEE.
However, adjectiveslike fresh-brewed, old, etc., which represent relative informa-tion about age, are linked indirectly to an ontological concept,via a constraint on the default range of the AGE property fora given class of objects.
For example, the SEM zone of lex-ical entry +fresh-brewed-nl establishes the followinglinkage:instance-of :  ' ~COFFEE or TEA''age: (range < 0.I)The range function calculates a default value for fresh-brewed coffee, namely, less than 10% of the ontologicallyspecified efault range for the AGE of COFFEE.Lastly, we demonstrate informally the interdependence oflexicon, ontology and text meaning representation in DIONY-SUS for the sentence I smelled the fresh-brewed coffee.
First,we identify the predicate-argument structure, and record thesyntactic pattern information i  the SYN-STRUC zone of thelexical entry for smell:smell  (the sense of 'vo luntary  percept ion' )ent i ty  that per forms a vo luntaryperceptua l  event: I (SUBJ)ent i ty  that is the target  of avo luntary  perceptua l  event:coffee (OBJ)Next, links between word sense and ontological conceptare created for the open-class lexical items in the sentence.These links are recorded in the SEM zone of the lexical entry,where a correspondence is established between semantic andsyntactic roles:smell ---+VOLUNTARY-OLFACTORY-EVENTAGENT: ANIMAL (^$varl); l inks to the SUBJ roleTHEME: PHYS ICAL-OBJECT (^$var2); l inks to the OBJ  roleThe A$varl retrieves the meaning of the lexeme bound tothe variable $varl during syntactic parsing, places it in theAGENT role of VOLUNTARY-OLFACTORY-EVENT, andchecks to make sure that the ontologically specified constraint(AGEN'I2.
ANIMAL) is satisfied.Finally, we illustrate the key components of the text mean-ing representation for a sentence:clausehead: vo luntary -o  i fac tory -event_ laspect  :phase : enddurat ion : p ro longedi terat ion:  s inglevo luntary-o i fact or y -event_ lagent: speakertheme: cof fee 1cof fee iage: < 0.4 hour3 ConclusionsWe have addressed some of the issues that arise when worldmodeling is viewed as.a component of knowledge support fornatural anguage processing.
In DIONYSUS, the interdepen-dence of ontology, lexicon and text meaning representation issuch that ontology acquisition ever proceeds in an isolatedfashion.
The discussion presented here regarding scalar at-tributes is just one example of ontological decision making incontext.
