However some GSRs are  more soph is t i ca ted .3 .1 .
The grammar par t  o f  GSRs has much in  common wi thSurface Syntactical Relations (3SR) of /1/.
Indeed the GSRshad been insp i r i ted  by SSRs.GSRs differ from SSRs in two aspectsz first, they system-atioally use semantic information!
second, GSRs usually dealwith a deeper syntax level!
e,g, if the grammar part of GSRpostu la tes  a "d i rec t -ob jec t  re la t ion" ,  i t s  descr ip t ion  maycover  ac t ive  and pass ive  verba l ,  par t i c ip ia l  and nominaloonst ruc t ionsz" t0  wr i te  a le t te r " ,  "a le t te r  i s  wr i t ten" ," the  le t te r  wr i t ten  by .

When NL text  has been t ransformed in to  a se t  ofp roper ty  l i s t s ,  fe tched  from the  vocabu lar ies  and augmented bymorpholog ica l  preeoan,  there  are many ways to o rder  the app l i c -a t ion  of  the re levant  GSRs, fo r ,  wh i le  each GSR i s  descr ibedprocedura l ly ,  the descr ip t ion  as a whole i s  dec la ra t ive .

The out l ined  approach demands a c lass i f i ca t ion  ofwords d i f fe rent  from one based on grammatical  c lasses .S ign i f i cant  words are devided in to  c lasses  depending onthe  ro le  they  p lay  in  n~ing  cor responding not ions .

in  the second one the word "son" inc ludes  are fe rence  to some "parent" ,  the most probably - Peter  ( i .e .the denotat  of  "Peter" ) .Def iu i  t ion :A word i s  Substant ia l  A t t r ibute  i f  i t  re fe rs  an ob jec tby naming i t s  re la t ion  to some other  ob jec t  or  s i tuat ion .In  text  Substant iona l  A t t r ibute  ac t fas  i f  i t  were boundby posese ive  re la t ion  to a "v i r tua l  pronoun" of  appropr ia tesemantic  c lass .
For example, these  two phrases can be yiewed8~and"The t ra in  goes to the cap i ta l  Eo f -count ry""Peter  gave hi_.ss son an apple"In  the f i r s t  phrase "1o f -count ry"  s tands fo r  such a"v i r tua l  pronoun".
In  the second one, "v i r tua l  pronoun" occas -iona l ly  turned to be a rea l  one; whi le  in  Eng l i sh  i t s  use i squ i te  natura l ,  in  Russian the use of  posess ive  pronoun wouldhave an emphatic meaning.The anaphora reso lu t ion  fo r  such "v i r tua l  pronouns"iS done in  the same way as fo r  rea l  ( lex ica l l y  expressed)  pro -nouns.
However, i t  i s  poss ib le  to take benef i t  of  the fac t ,- 53  -that  "v i r tua l  pronoun" re fers  an ins tance  of spec i f ied  not ion ,whi le fo r  rea l  pronoun only  grammatical  va lues  ere known.Another example:"President and wife came to capital"(Articles and pronouns ere dropped to reflect Russian),This phrase is processed as"President roof-country with xhis wife came to capital Eof-country".Indeed the wife i s  the wife of th i s  p res ident ,  and theycame to the c i ty ,  which i s  the cap i ta l  of the count ry  of whichhe i s  the pres ident .
To in fe r  th i s  from the phrase no ext ra --linguistic deduction is needed.4.3 ,  The experiments have shown, that treating SAs astwo words: one refering an object and another a "virtual pro-noun", is helpful in analysis oriented on extraction of mean-Ing of the text.
In fact It deals with a more general questionof the limits between "language knowledge" and "knowledge ofworld".References:I.
