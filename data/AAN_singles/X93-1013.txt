TASKSThe information extraction tasks for the ARPA TIP-STER program center on automatically filling object-ori-ented data structures, called templates, with informationextracted from free text in news stories (for discussion oftemplates and objects, see "Template Design for Informa-tion Extraction" in this volume).
With text as input, theTIPSTER systems first detect whether the text contains rel-evant information.
If so, the systems extract specificinstances of generic types of information that correspond toeach slot in the template and output hat information by fill-ing the template slots in an appropriate data representation.These slots are then scored by using an automatic scoringprogram with templates produced by human analysts thatserve as answer keys.
Human analysts also prepared evel-opment set templates for each domain, which served astraining models for system developers (for discussion ofthe data preparation effort, see "Corpora nd Data Prepara-tion for Information Extraction" in this volume).With the TIPSTER program goal of demonstratingdomain and language-independent algorithms, extractiontasks for two domains (joint ventures and microelectronicschip fabrication) for both English and Japanese were identi-fied.
The selection criteria for this pair of languagesincluded linguistic diversity, availability of on-lineresources, and availability of computer support resources.The four pairs include EJV, JJV, EME, and JME, abbrevi-ated to reflect he language (E or J) and the domain (JV orME).
The tasks, domains and languages used for the infor-marion extraction portion of the TIPSTER program werealso used for the Fifth Message Understanding Conference(MUC-5).
In MUC-5, non-TIPSTER participants couldchoose to perform in one of the domains in Japanese and/orEnglish.
Of the TIPSTER participants, three performed inall four pairs, and the fourth in both domains but only inEnglish.2.
THE JO INT  VENTURE DOMAINThe reporting task for the domain of Joint Venturesinvolves capturing information about business activities ofentities (companies, governments, individuals, or otherorganizations) who enter into a cooperative agreement for aspecific project or purpose.
The partnership formedbetween these ntities may or may not result in the creationof a separate joint venture company to carry out the activi-ties of the agreement.
In many cases, a looser cooperativearrangement between partner entities (called a 'tie up') isestablished; information about fie ups is also captured aspart of the JV task.
A tie up may involve joint productdevelopment, market share arrangements, technologytransfer, etc.
The terms 'tie up' and 'joint venture' aresometimes used interchangeably in describing the JointVenture domain.
In addition to reporting information aboutnew joint ventures, the JV task also involves capturinginformation from reports of the activity of existing jointventures or about changes in any joint venture agreements.In other words, any discussion of joint ventures in anynews article is to be reported, so long as enough informa-tion is presented to meet he minimal reporting conditions,namely, that at least wo entities are involved in a two-waydiscussion about forming a joint venture, or have enteredinto such an agreement, and that at least one piece of iden-tifying information is known about each involved entity,such as its name, nationality, or location.The JV template consists of eleven different objecttypes, which together capture ssential information aboutjoint venture formation and activities (the canonical who,what, where, when, and why).
The TIE-UP-RELATION-SHIP object captures the most basic information about atie up or joint venture discussed in a particular document,including who the tie-up partner ENTITYs are, and whothe joint venture (or "child") company is, if one is formed.Additionally, for the TIE-UP-RELATIONSHIP,  theSTATUS of the joint venture is recorded, along with infor-mation about OWNERSHIP  and ACTIVITYs associatedwith the tie up.
The ACTIVITY involves information123TEMPLATETIE-UP-RELATIONOWNERSHIP ENTITY ACTIVITYENTITY-REI.ATION/PERSONFACILITYREVENUEINDUSTRYTIMEFigure 1: Joint Venture template object ypes (and pointers)about what the joint venture will be doing, including whatINDUSTRYS the tie up will be involved in, where theactivity will take place, when it will start and end, and howmuch REVENUE is expected from the venture.
TheINDUSTRY of the joint venture is captured in categoricalterms (MANUFACTURING, RESEARCH, SALES, etc.
),and also coded as one or more Standard Industrial Classifi-cation categories (see Section 4 below) linked with thespecific words in the text that define the business.Figure 1 illustrates the object ypes and the interrela-tions among them in the Joint Ventures domain.
Note thatmultiple interrelations may be represented by one arrow;for example, the T IE -UP-RELAT IONSHIP  object hastwo possible interrelationships with ENTITY objects, i.e.,either identification ofthe parents in a tie up, or identifica-tion of the joint venture child company itself.
The relativecomplexity of the template design mirrors the intricaciesinherent in the tie-up event itself.Appendix A gives a straightforward example from theEnglish Joint Venture domain, including an excerpt from anEJV article, along with its corresponding filled-out em-plate.
There is one tie up in this article, triggered by theannouncement that "Bridgestone Sports Co .... has set up ajoint venture in Taiwan."
This tie up has three parent orpartner companies CBridgestone Sports Co.," "Union Pre-cision Casting Co.," and "Taga Co.") and a child company("Bridgestone Sports Taiwan Co.") that will be engaged inthe production of golf clubs.
Although there is only oneTIE-UP in this article, multiple tie ups in a single articleare common in the English and Japanese corpora.
In thediagram in Figure 3, note the different labels on the ares;e.g., the TIE-UP-RELATIONSHIP has two types of arcspointing to ENTITYs, reflecting the two types of interrela-tionships discussed above, namely, "parent company" and"joint venture child company.
"In Appendix C, an example is given from the Japanese124Joint Venture domain.
The excerpted article references anew activity about o get underway in the financial arena,namely, issuing of a new credit card.
This new product isthe result of a recent ie up between "Daimaru" and "sixcompanies of the VISA Card Group, including "SumitomoCredit Service."
In accordance with the JJV fill rules (see"Corpora nd Data Preparation for Information Extraction"in this volume), the tie up is instantiated between Daimaruand Sumitomo Credit Service, which is regarded as thegroup leader for the VISA Card Group, because it is theonly group member explicitly mentioned in the text.
Thetemplate indicates a single ACTIVITY, with an INDUS-TRY type FINANCE, and product/service string "issuingthe Daimaru Excel VISA card."3.
THE MICROELECTRONICS DOMAINThe reporting task in the domain of Microelectronicsinvolves capturing information about advances in fourtypes of chip fabrication processing technologies: layering,lithography, etching, and packaging.
For each process, thisinformation relates to process-specific parameters that typ-ify advancements.
For example, the introduction of a newtype of film used in layering (that is, adding material to thesubstrate of a chip) or an increase in the resolution possiblein lithography both indicate new developments in fabrica-tion technology.
To be reported, each process must be asso-ciated with some identifiable ntity that is manufacturing,selling, or distributing equipment, or developing or usingprocessing technology.The MICROELECTRONICS-CAPABIL ITY  templateobject links together information about he four fabricationtechnologies (LITHOGRAPHY, LAYERING, PACKAGING,and ETCHING) with the ENTITYS, typically companies,associated with one of the technologies as its DEVELOPER,MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR, or PURCHASER_-USER.
Additionally, the template captures informationabout he specific EQUIPMENT used, developed, or sold, aswell as information about the type of chips or DEVICEsthat are expected to be produced by that technology.
Thereare nine objects in the domain.Figure 2 illustrates the object types captured in theMicroelectronics template.
Appendix B provides an exam-ple from the Microelectronics domain, including an excerptfrom an EME article, along with its corresponding filled-out template.
There are two microelectronic capabilities inthis example.
The first capability is succinctly representedin the first sentence with the identification of a lithographyprocess ("a new stepper") associated with an entity ("NikonCorp.")
as the manufacturer and distributor ("to market") ofa piece of equipment that implements a lithographic pro-cess.
Note also that the technology will be used to producea device ("64-Mbit DRAMs"), which satisfies the reportingcondition requirement for technology connection to inte-grated circuit production.
Additional information about heprocess and equipment occurs in the text.
The second capa-bility stems from information in the second sentence (i.e.,"compared to the 0.5 micron of the company's latest step-per").
The need to interpret this segment within the contextof the discourse demonstrates the level of text understand-ing required in this domain.4.
DOMAIN D IFFERENCESThe JV and ME domains differ in the focus of theirtask, type of complexity, and level of technicality.
The focusof the JV task is the tie-up formation and the correspondingactivities of the resulting agreement.
Thus, to a large extent,the task is event-driven.
The information to be extractedincludes the participants in the event, the economic activityof the event, and adjunct information about he event, suchas time, facilities, revenue, and ownership.
Entities are cen-tral, specifically within the context of the tie-up relation-ship.
In addition, relationships also dominate in that the tie-up event presents a cohesive collection of linked objects,e.g., persons and facilities linked to entities, entities linkedto other entities, industries linked to activities, and so on.The overarching task is fitting together the interrelatedpieces of the single tie-up event.The focus of the ME task is the four microelectronicschip fabrication processes and their attributes.
The task isnot triggered by a particular event, as in JV; the focus is onmore static information.
The information to be extractedincludes the processes with their attributes and associateddevices and pieces of equipment.
Processes are central inME, whereas entities are in some sense auxiliary.
Althoughclearly the information about processes must be associatedwith an entity to be relevant, he task design centers on theprocesses themselves and their attributes.
Essentially, thedomain fractures into four separate sub-tasks, one for eachprocess.
Linking attributes to a process, like film or temper-ature to the layering process, involves defining the processin terms of key characteristics nherent in the process itself.Both devices and pieces of equipment are also associatedwith processes, but in quite different and indirect ways.Equipment represents the implementation of a process,whereas devices represent the application of a process.
Nosingle overarching task applies for the ME domain; rather,there are four separate, concurrent subtasks in which associ-ated characteristics of processes are identified.The two domains also differ in the nature of their com-plexity.
The complexity of the JV domain lies not in the pre-dominance of technical jargon but in the intricacies of theinterrelationships within a tie-up event.
These intricacies125TEMPLATEMICRO-CAPABILITY ENTITYLAYERING ETCHING LITHOGRAPHY PACKAGINGDEVICE I I EQUIPMENTFigure 2: Microelectronics template object ypes (and pointers)cover a broad range of activities that legitimately fall withinthe domain of joint business ventures.
Since there is no sin-gle way to create a business relationship of the sort cap-tured in this domain, there can be many points at whichinterpretation r judgment comes into play.
Although thisinterpretation can be minimized by specification (some-times arbitrary) in the frill rules, the open-endedness, and insome ways potential for creativity, in how a tie-up is real-ized results in domain complexity.
For example, determin-ing whether or not a text has enough information to warrantreporting atie up, or whether there is sufficient evidence fora tie-up activity, may require a substantial mount of judg-ment on the part of the analyst.
Initially, there was a widevariation in interpretation f these issues among the JV ana-lysts for each language.
However, through frequent meet-ings, these differences in interpretation were narrowed overtime, and there was a convergence of viewpoints on whatinformation to extract from a given JV document and howto represent i in the template.
The fill rules were continu-ally modified and updated to incorporate the heuristicsdeveloped by the analysts for determining when a valid tieup or activity existed.The resolution of coreferences, which also contributesto domain complexity, is a key task in the Joint Venturesdomain.
In particular, the entities in the JV documents weretypically referenced in multiple ways.
The EJV example inAppendix A illustrates one case where each of the E1vrI-TYs is referred to at least hree times in the text, and each ofthose multiple (and differing) references may contributeadditional information to the ENTITY objects.
For exam-ple, the phrase "the Japanese sports goods maker" needs tobe coreferenced with "Bridgestone Sports Co." in order toidentify the nationality of Bridgestone.
Of equal importancein the JV domain is event-level coreference determination,in other words, determining which joint ventures are uniqueamong a set of multiple apparent joint ventures in the text.For example, the article~in Appendix A has multiple para-graphs, each discussing a joint venture, and event-levelcoreference r solution is required to determine that they are126all discussing the same joint venture, not four differentones.
This coreference layering problem at both entity andevent levels makes extraction difficult in this domain.In comparison, the ME domain derives complexitynot from interrelationships, but from its composition.
Thereare four sub-domains, one for each process.
Each sub-domain corresponds to a process with attributes, two ofwhich can be devices or pieces of equipment.
In addition,entities are associated with these processes in one of fourdifferent capacities: developer, manufacturer, distributor, orpurchaser/user.
Adding complexity to the ME domain is thepre-requisite to connect he technology to integrated chipproduction.The third area of domain difference is the level oftechnicality, namely, the extent o which highly technicalterms and knowledge are used.
The JV domain lies withinthe financial/economic area, and the articles are typical ofgeneral business news.
The one element of the JV domainthat relies more on technical jargon or specific technicaldescriptions i the product or service that the joint venturewill be involved in.
This information, in addition to beingreported as an exact string fill from the text, also is reportedin the JV template as a two-digit code, according to theStandard Industrial Classification manual of the U. S.Office of Management and Budget.
These strings mayinvolve technical terms; for example, "ignition wiring har-ness" is classified under SIC 36, which includes electronicand other electrical equipment and components.In contrast, the ME domain lies within the scientificand technical arena with a corpus composed of productannouncements and reports on research advances.
The textsare loaded with domain-specific technical terms, at timesdetailing chip fabrication methodology.
The fill rules pro-vide a resource for this technical terminology, which essen-tially provides hooks into the text for extracted information.These hooks mean that in the pre-processing stage, some ofthe extracted information can be identified as discretetagged elements and then confirmed for extraction i  laterstages of processing.
This "bias for keywording" is less-ened to some extent by the higher percentage of irrelevantdocuments in the ME corpus than the JV corpus and by tworequirements in the reporting conditions (i.e., a processmust be associated with an entity in one of four roles andthe application for the process must be related to integratedcircuits).5.
LANGUAGE DIFFERENCESAlthough the Japanese and English tasks are appar-ently identical (other than the language of the texts andtemplates), subtle differences emerge with closer scrutinyof the corpora, template definitions, and fill rules (see "Cor-pora and Data Preparation for Information Extraction" inthis volume) for each of the two languages.
The corpora forEnglish and Japanese differ, in that the two English corporaare drawn from more than 200 sources each, and have afairly low percentage of irrelevant documents in the set,whereas the Japanese corpora have a limited set of sources,but a higher percentage of irrelevant documents.Over the ,course of the data preparation task, differ-ences between the English and Japanese texts were gradu-ally identified and strategies for dealing with them wereincorporated into the fill roles.
A major difference betweentexts in the JV domain is the fact that in the JJV corpus, themost typical relationship involves two entities joiningtogether in a tie up where no joint venture company is cre-ated, whereas in EJV, the typical relationship involves onein which two entities form a joint venture company as partof the agreement.
In EJV, texts which were produced byJapanese news sources (in English) could also reflect hetype of tie-up arrangement typical of the Japanese texts, i.e.,where no joint venture company is formed.Differences between Japanese and English are alsoreflected in minor discrepancies in the Japanese and Englishtemplate definitions and more substantial divergences in thecorresponding fill rules.
While every attempt was made tokeep the template definition for each domain identicalacross languages, there are some differences.
Thus,although the English and Japanese templates have the sameobjects and slots for each domain, there are cases where thecontent or format of the fills for a particular slot vary fromone language to the other, reflecting differences in the twocorpora.In the JJV and EJV templates, an example of a contentdifference in fillers is seen in the FACILITY object'sFACILITY-TYPE slot, which is a set fill for both EIV andJJV.
However, for EJV the fillers include COMMUNICA-TIONS, SITE, FACTORY, FARM, OFFICE, MINE,STORE, TRANSPORTATION, UTILITIES, WAREHOUSE,and OTHER, whereas in JJV, the fillers are (translated):STORE, RESEARCH_INSTITUTE, FACTORY, CENTER,OFFICE, TRANSPORTATION, COMMUNICATIONS,CULTURE/LEISURE, and OTHER.
The fillers weredefined and selected by the analysts to reflect he types ofinformation most commonly found in the corpora.A format difference in slot fills between languages (forboth \]V and ME) is exhibited in the ENTITY object's NAMEslot, where English requires a normalized form for theentity name, based on a standardized list of abbreviationsfor corporate designators, including more familiar ones likeINC (incorporated) and LTD (limited), as well as some spe-127cifically used by foreign firms, such as AG (for Aktienge-sellschaft - Germany), EC (for Exempt Company --Bahrain), and PERJAN (for Perusuhan Jawatan -- Indone-sia).
For Japanese, such a list of designators was not avail-able, and in the corpus itself, most companies are indicatedby the ending sha or kaisha, so it was decided that a stringfill would be more appropriate for this slot filler.The JJV fill rules give detailed decision trees fordetermining who the tie-up partners are.
This reflects thefact that in the JJV corpus, the texts often begin by men-tioning a tie up between two groups.
For example, the twogroups might be Mitsubishi Group and Daimler Group, butthen, ha the second paragraph, one learns that the actual tieup is between Mitsubishi Shoji and Dairnler Benz.
The JJVfill rules explicitly address this type of situation, since itoccurs frequently in the corpus.
The fill rules stipulate thatin cases of tie ups between groups, the group leaders are tobe taken as the tie-up partners, if they are mentioned in thetext.
The EJV fill rules address a slighdy different problem,namely, of how to represent tie-up partners if the text states"Four Malaysian finance firms announced a joint ven-ture...," in which case a tie up between two (not four) iden-tical partner entities would be created.
This situation did nottypically arise in the JJV corpus.As with the JV domain, the two ME corpora highlightsignificant differences.
First, there are basically three newssources for the JME corpus, the same set of sources as forthe JJV corpus.
The EME corpus, on the other hand, isselected from a business and trade database with more than200 different sources.
Second, the J/VIE corpus (30%) con-tains a higher percentage of irrelevant documents than theEnglish corpus (20%).
Third, even though the relative pro-portion of the four process types is similar, there is a dis-tinct difference between languages in the type ofinformation available for the PACKAGING object.
Not onlyis there considerably more information available for allPACKAGING slots for English, there is also clear evidencethat information for the BONDING and UNITSPER_-PACKAGE slots is infrequently available in Japanese.English texts are also more likely than Japanese texts tocontain two or more PACKAGING objects, which may par-dally explain anecdotal reports that PACKAGING textswere considered ifficult to code for the English analysts,but easy for the Japanese analyst.There are actually no substantive differences reflectedin the two sets of fill rules for the ME domain.
However,differences between languages are indicated in the type ofinformation available for extraction.
For example, some setfill choices in the template simply do not occur in Japanese,like some of the hierarchical set fill choices for the PACK-AGING object's TYPE slot in ME.
Also the keywords,"gate size" and "feature size" that indicate granularity forthe LITHOGRAPHY object do not occur in the Japanesecorpus.
Other minor differences are also indicated in the fillrules as to how the information is represented in the Englishand Japanese texts.
To illustrate, in contrast to the EME fillrules, the Japanese fill rules are more likely to fist relevantkeywords in the text associated with ENTITY roles and toidentify relevant stereotypic format clues for location infor-mation.
This approach suggests the greater likelihood ofidentifiable patterns within the Japanese text.
Another illus-tration of the dissimilarity in information presentation is theJapanese inclusion of English within the Japanese text, forexample in layering or packaging types or in entity names.128APPENDIX  A: Example from Engl ish Joint VenturesSource document sections: (Note the SGML tags delimiting document and headers.
