aodology and Ver i f iabi l i ty  in Rontague GrammarSeiki AkamaFujitsu Ltd.2-4-19,Sin-Yokohama, Yokohama, 222,Japan.AbstractNethodological problems in Men\[ague Grammar arediscussed.
Our observations show that amodel-theoretic approach to natural language semanticsis inadequate with respect to its ver i f iab i l i ty  fromlogical point of view.
But, the formal att i tudes seemto be of use for the development in computationallinguistics.O..introductlonIn this paper we discuss the methodology ofver i f iab i l i ty  taken by  researchers on model-theoreticsemantics for natural language such as ~ontague ~rammar.Though Montague grammar (hereafter MG) has beendeveloping since the publication of Montague\[lO\], therehas been few serious studies of i ts  'sense' andmethodology.Ne take the purpose of semantics to be as follows.I ?
, (a) To define a meanLng .
(b) To define a 'meaning' of certain l inguist-itexpressions.
(c) To generalize a 'meaning' referred as (h) inconnection with internal world (human) andexternal world.ltere (a) is so abstract that i t  must he dicussed ingeneral l inguist ic terms rather than in MG.
But i t  isno doubt that the methodologies in ~G are based on theassumption (c).
The problem (c) is central to MG. InMG semantic structure corresponding to syntacticstructure of natural language is realized by means ofits methodologies.The problem (c) is closely related with pragmatlcsand epistemology thus HG includes parts of them.
AsChomsky's early transformational grammar was obliged tochanges of the system for the sake of autonomous syntaxhypothesis, the problem is important in MG. lntensionaland possible-world semantic~ could solve parts ofthe problems.
But i t  is d i f f i cu l t  to ~ay that MG is asystem facilitating (c).
And methodological problems ofMG including (c) are mainly ascribed to model theorjunderlying MG. Ne shall focus on the point and discuss~G's methodology.
Ezpecially following problems areinvestigated.
(1) Is in\[arts\[anal logic necessary?
(2) Can modal (tense) logic express a modality(tense) in natural language?
(3) Is first-order logic necessary?
(4) Is there a possibility of natural logic?
(bO Are there appropriate methods for theinterpretation of logical form?
(6) Is there a dist inct ion between logical wordsand content ~rds in natural language?~, MG and ~ode\[ Thepr2The purpose of model theory is to investigate therelationships between a true statement in some formallanguage and i ts  model.
Namely, i t  is to define aconcept of 'truth' in some mathematical structures.
Inmathematical logic Tarski\[14\] f i r s t  attempted to studythe idea of model.
In his paper Tarski mainly concernedhimself with the definit ion of truth (the correctdef init ion of a true sentence), lie confined hisdiscussions to the object in the framework of predicatelogic in the sense modern logic, lie despaired to definea true sentence in natural langufige.
Since we areobliged to face to paradoxes for the sake ofuniversal ity of natural language.
But he suggested thatthere exists a possibi l i ty of application of the resutt~for model theory, which he gave to the language hecalled 'formalized language', to natural language.88About forty years after the publication, Hontague, whois a disciple of his, could give a model theory fornatural language.
Moatague regarded intensional logicas a basis of his theory so as to overcome complexitiesof natural language.
He was able to solve paradoxes,that Frege and others faced, by means of intensionallogic.F i rs t  we consider the problems of intensionallogic.
The model of intenslonal logo comes to be morecomplicated because it has a greater descriptive powerthan predicate logic in general.
As Gall\[hi3\] pointedout, valid formulas in intensiona\[ logic fail toconstitute a recurs\[rely enumerable set since it isessentially based on type theory.
Thus we have noaxiomatization for this logic.
For this reason, we mustrestrict the scope of sentences in natural languagecapable of being treated by intensional logic.
But thenotation of intens~onal logic used in PTfi such as '"and '~' work efficiently for analysis, For example,consider the following sentences.Every man loves a man.
(1-1)We have two interpretations for the sentences, namely,(every man)(loves a man.)
(I-2)(every man loves)(a man.)
(i-3)In general we call (i-2) de dicte reading, (I-3) de rereading, and obtain the following translationsrespectively,Vx(man' (x) --> love' (x,'~Q~y(~oman' (y) A Q{y})).
(1-4)By(woman' (5,) AVx(man' (x) --> love' (x, *~PP{y}))).
(I-5)Seen from the above formulas, in (1-2) that everyman loves is not an individual 'woman' bat a property ofproperty of a individual 'woman'.
Ihat is, the meaningof individuals (inteesion) is considered as a mappingfrom possible-worlds to a reference (extension).
If t.edefine a possible-world as a set of indices, anddetermine the value for each index, then some extensionis defined.
But we doubt that an intenslon defined inintensional logic properly represents a meaning.In MS individuals and truth values are assumed assemantic primitives.
Using possible-world semantics wecan extend predicate logic.
This extension causes theatructure of model to be more complex, and produces lotsof contradictions as natural language semantics.
Aboveall the problems of logical enuivalence is serious.
Forexample, assume a and h for logically equivalentformulas, that is, a and b are true in same indices.Then it is a valid inference from doubt(p,'a) todoubt(p,'b).
If we doubt a, we would doubt b logicallyequivalent to a from the standpoint of logicallyequivalence thus for p, a and b have differerntmeanings.
To put it more correctly, the meaning of'doubt' in a and b is dif ferent unless p knows thecorrect sense of logically equivalence between a and b.Such a statement fails to be explained in tradltonallogic.
This is nothing but a l imitation of ordinarymode\[ theory.
Researchers such as geenan\[8\],Thomason\[15\] and Turner\[1G\] tried to extend tntensionailogic from various viewpoints.
Thomason addedintensional logic to third type of propositions, whichis a denotation of a sentence.
Thus we clearly need adomain containing at least two propoaitiona of a modelfor intone\[anal logic.
Eeenan introduced the concept of9ntple~ ca ly perfection, that is, the element of theontology are poasible denotatona for extensions forexpressions, by means of Boolean algebra.
~ismotivation is to restrict a domain of intenslonal logic.Thus the set of possible world is defined in terms of~Oxlmally conslstent sot of propositions, sentencedenotations.Turner\[16j extended intenslonai 1ogle in the senseof type-free theory in which a self-annlication ispermitted for the treatment of nominalizations.
We arevery intere:;ting in such strategies since in Scott-typedenotational semantics we have no intermediate languageas in PTQ.
Thus we can obtain semantic interpretationof a sentence directly.
We have an idea for types ofnatural language, namely, polvmorohic types, which canhave various types.
These types are essentiallyconsidered as a subset of type-free theory.Above mentioned tr ials are restr ict ions to a mode\[for intensional logic.
But such perplexed constructionsmuct cause us more difficulties in reality.
Hunt wegive up thi.
'~ logic?
It is certain though intensionailogic has the sides against our intuitions, i t  canprovide a powerful model for some phenomena.
Forexample, consider the following sentences referred to as~ s a d o x .
(I) The temperature is ninety.
(2) The temperarure ises.
(3) Ninety rises.The~e are translated into formulas in intensional logicas :(I) ~y(Vx(temerature' (x) <--> x=y) ^ "y=n)(2) ~y(Vx(temerature' (x) <--> x-y) .~rise' (y))(3) rise' ('n) .
(I-7)As seen from (?)
Hontague dealt with noun phrases asobjects which have intensions and extensions.
In theexamples, intensions are represented as functions thatdenote some number at each index, and extensions arerendered as particular number such as 90 at certainindex.
Namely, the truth value of sentence (2) in (1-6)depends not on extension but on intension.
For thisreason verbs such as ' r i se '  referred to as intensionalverb...~.
But such for~lisms eem to be recaputuiated inthe framework of predicate logic.
If so, i t  iseffective from not only intuitive but also computationalpoint of views.
~Such formalisms are divided into b#oapproaches.
One is an approach that is an extension ofpredicate logic to intensional logicusing some devicesas in Schubert and Pelletier\[13\].
Another is anapproach that intensionnI logic is interpreted as aprogramming language such as LISP as in Hobbs andRosenschein\[G\].
Schubert and Pelletier stated thatpredicate logic is suitable from the viewpoint of A\[systems.
According to them, the  expressions inintensional logic are not comprehensive to human being.For example, i t  is better understandable to capturedefinite noun phrases as individuals than a set ofproperties.
Slot representations conquest gaps tointensional.
In this formulation a proper name isrepresented as a constant, a common oun as a monadlcpedicate and a transit ive verb as a binary predicate.
'Hary' =:> Hary I'boy' "=> (Ili boy) (I-8)'loves' ~:> (lit loves tt2)ltere ~n is called argument slot that is f i l led fromhigher number in turn.
The sentence (i-2) and (i-3) aretranslated as follows.de dlcto:for al I (~I man) ((~I loves 112) (for some (112 woman)))==> YX(X man) =-> (xlovesA-~y(y woman))) (i-9)de re:for som.
(l;~ woman)(Ill oves ltg)(for a l l ( i l l  man))"=>~y((y woman) A(Vx(x man) --> x loves y)) (i-I0)These translations are similar to the formulas inpredicate logic, ltere slot representations enable us tooperate a scoplng of noun phre~es.
This device seems tohave some simulating with combinators in combinatorylogic.Ilobbs and Rosenschein tried to convert intensionallogic to S-expressions in LISP.
The lambda expressionsare considered as the pure LISP thus the conversion isplausible.
Such expressions are exemplified as follows.
(constant) -:> (QUOTE ~()m(a variable of type <s,b> for any b) ==> (\[IUOTE~()"W "> (LIST(QUOTE QUOTE,S) ( i - \ [ i )"~ ,-> EVAL o(The sentence (l) in (I-7) is translated inninety ==> (L,~BDA(Q) ((g~) (INT* 90))be ==> (L,1NBDA (P) (LA,~BDA ix) ((P*) (INT~(LA~BDA (y)(EOU~L (X*) (YD)))))))the temperature ==> (LAHBDA (P)(FOR SO,'IEENTITY-COYCEPTS (LAY, BDA (Y) (FOR ALLE,~IT ITY-CONCEPTS (LA,'iBDA (X)(At~D(IFF(TEHP X)(EQUAL X Y))((P~)Y)))))))the temperature is ninety==> ((TIIE (FUNCTIO~I TEHP))(INT~(BE (INT~(FUNCTION NUIETT))))INT ~ (L,~HBDA (G) (LAHBDA (*) G)) (i-12)Here we may assume there is a variabIe named * to thevalue of which are applied to produce the correspondingextensions.
Above two trials are for approximating thefunctions of lntensional logic by means of simpler~ystem in order to reduce inherited complexities in thislogic.
In any case deficiencies of intensionaI logicare ascribed to model theory, and even if we take itoff, i t  is doubtful that intension formulated inintensional logic corresponds to the meaning ofl inguist ic expressions.Next we consider tense logic and modal logic.
Asboth logic.~ are based on possible-world semantics wecome to face tbe name problems in genera1, tlere ~Jediscuss the problems involved in direct app\[ications tonatural language.
In tense logic the operators P and Tare able to apply infinitely in principle but inpractlce the scope of tense has some boundary.
Thus i tis not easy to solve tense in natural language only bythese t~o operators.
Bauerle\[2~ introduced thirdoperator T ( it  is the case on .
.
.
that .
.
. )
so as toovercome shortcomings of traditional tense logic as inthe axiomatization by Priori13\].
In tense logic thefollowing relations hold.FF ~ --> F~ (1-13)PP P--> P@ (1-14)The~e formulas are proved by means of the transit lvltyof <.
Such relations assume all forms of the past(future) tense as quantification over times past(future).
But to avoid the infinite application oftense operators we must take a strategy that tense canbe considered as a point of reference by Reichenhach.That is, we can regard past tense as direct reference tosome particular past time, not universal quantification.Similarly in modal ogic it is doubt that the t~ooperators enable us to explain the modality of naturallanguage.
First of all modalities are divided into theo~.ct ive and the su___bb\]ec__tive.
And modal logic canmanage only objective modaliLy.
Suppose the folloNingexamples.John cannot be a Japanese.
(1-I5)It is impossible John is a Japanese.
(1-16)If we translate these sentences into formulas in~G we obtain the one in only (I-16).~QJapanese' (j) (= I:I~Japanese' ( j ))  (I-17)In other words the sentence in (1-15) belong to thecategory of snbjective modality thus it is impossiblethat the subject is a logical connection of the functionto each constihmnt (namely content word) in thestatement rather than some kind of operation to thestatement (namely truth value).
Unfortunately, most ofthe modalities in natural language belong to objectivemodality.
We can state that semantic", in logic is notalways l inguistically valid.
Chomsky\[3\] called HG atype of descriptive semantic~ except that he thlnk~ itis not semantics really, in the sense that i t  does notdeal with the classical questions of semantics such asthe relation between language and the world.The situations do not change even if we restr ic tlogic to predicate logic.
And if we want predicatelogic to be psychologically real, though we will discussthin in section 2 in detai l ,  we wi l l  reply in negativedue to Lowenheim-Skolem'n theorem.When we interpret he so-called logical forms, ifwe depend on the idea of intensional ogic, i t  happens alot of i r ra t iona l i t ies .
Namely, the interpretation isnothing but a decision procedure of truth condition.Since ~G is based on F r ~ ,  the truth value89of a sentence is a function of the one of parts and itis d i f f icu l t  to add interpretation of l inguisticconstralnt~ to the system of formal logic.
Thus NaturalLogic was proposed.
Lakoff\[9\] said that the semanticstructure of natural language co~responds to thegrammartlcal structure and that Natural Logic must beable to explain logical inferences in natural language.Thus it is possible to consider that Natural Logicpossesses similar framework to TG rather than HG.
Fromthe standpoint of Gg theory in TG, IIornstain\[?\]pur:ueted logical forms, lie claimed that semanticsshould also he exp\[ained from the same hypotheses(hmateness) as syntax.
We think that his approach ismore rea l is t ic  and rational theory if such theories areto be formalized in view of psycho\[egg.
We can find asimilar approach, though it may be more ambitious, inJohnson-Laird\[8!.
Necessity of Natural Logic seems tobe derived from the drawbacks of formal logic owing toits ar t i f ica l l ty .
As we take up the sixth problembefore, there is a clear distinction between logicalwords and content words, and we faced s t r i c t  typeconstraints.
~ost inferences in natural language areexecuted by means of logical words.
In an extreme terms,we can infer only if ~e know inference rules.
But ourdaiIy inferences eem to depend on the property ofcontent words.We therefore need the counterpart of inferencerules in logic for inferences depended on content ~ords.The abuse of mean{as postulates at lexicaI levelprovide no solution.
Since Natural Logic is based onthe principle of universal grammar in grammarticaltheory.
But if Natural Logic adopts predicate logic as adevice for logical forms, i t  is impossible that thelogic overcome its d i f f icul t ies.2.
~ and tln~uisti?
Theor',Finally we shall investigate into philosophlcalaspects of ~g.
We can find fen research involved in theissues of methodology and philosophy in HG.
?
Theexception is Partee\[l l \] .
She tried to just i fytheoretical validity of MG in connection withpsychological reality.
Hen\[ague himself apprared toreconstruct l inguistics oa the basis of the samemethodo\[ogy in mathematics, thus there ex\[sta nopsychological factor here.
Dowty\[~\] also stands in theposition that semantics is a f ield handling thereIationships between l inguistic exprssioas and externalworlds.
Are there hypotheses in ~G in different placefrom our mind?
We hard to receive such radicalopinions.
Even if we discover reality in ~G, it isdoubtful whether theoretical validity of HG is verified.For example, we have the assumption that individualsand truth values are semantic primitives in ~G.
What isan individual?
At a f i r s t  glance individuals aregrasped at ease, but we can never clarify what it is.The assumption of model theory says that a set ofindividuals is never empty in some structure.
Suppose apossible-~orld that consists of only humans as itselements.
Even if this set has countably inf initepower, i t wi l l  be empty someday because humans aremortal.
This contradict: the assumption.
Hare doubtfulfact is tm~ individuals corresponding to dead humans arerepresented in a model.
And, by Lowenheim-Skolem'sthereto there exists a countable model if a model exists.This impties that we have d i f f icu l t ies  to identify aset of individuals in its model.
Can ~e findver i f iabi l l  ty and reality in such concepts?Now we cannot deny a human semantic competence.Partee derided level of semantics into t~o parts andinsisted that semantics in lexica\[ level ia a mentalpar~.
The claim sho~s that it is improper to advancemodel-theoretic approaches in ~g to l inguistic lever.llere we recognize many problems in her insistence?According to her argument, i t  is real ist ic  to chooseappropriate individuals and possible-worlds in models ofintensional ogic and Hontague's attempt is to definenot a unique intensional modot but a family of models.We believe human can never recounize such models in his90mind.
She said that human need not know allpossible-worlds and choose opt\[mai world by means of themechanisms as \[nductiou.
This idea'is very suspiciousbut we do not know how to verify it now.
That is, thespecification of a particular actual model, $dlich shecalled, cannot be ' rea l i s t i c '  if we use model theoreticsemantics as intensional (or predicate) logic.From above considerat\[ons, we Nl l l  conclude thefollowing.
Lingulstic~ is a part of philosophy rathe:"than psychology.
Since psychology has not completesystems, we do not intend to say psychology i~ anincomplete study, the object of semantics is bo~h humaa~ourselves and external worlds.
Of course we can mentionthat methodology in ~G is a small part of our internalworld.
~e want to insist  that we ought to unifypragmatics as ~G provided the ~ay unifying syntax andsemantics.
~ethodology in ~G must be a foothold of it .At that time it  does not matter whether there exists areal ity in the methodology.
The important hing is thatsuch a methodology can constitute a part of real ist icl inguistic theory.
\[n other words, logical forms may beinterpreted both more logically and psychologically.After all  we can oniy see the worlds through tintedglasses, namely our language.
To make matters worse, wenever take off our glasses.
Living things such as beesand birds may look the ~orlds in more effective ways.And we want to know abner the worlds more.
To do so, wecome to set down our tinted lense.
In the case of ~Gits settings are performed by model theory.
If thedegree of lense sl ip down we will look at the world instrayed eyes.
If we fall into the case, we shouldref lect  on ourselves again.
This reflection MII causeus to find the way hew to know natural language better.~eference~1.
