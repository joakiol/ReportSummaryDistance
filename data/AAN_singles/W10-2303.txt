Particularly, we look at the influenceof frequency on the process of lexical acquis i-tion and use.
We examine data obtained frompsycholinguistic action naming  tasks per-formed by children and adults (speakers ofBrazilian Portuguese), and analyze some cha-racteristics of the verbs used by each group interms of similarity of content, using Jaccard?scoefficient, and of topology, using graphtheory.
The experiments suggest that youngerchildren tend to use more frequent verbs thanadults to describe events in the world.1 IntroductionThe cognitive influence of frequency has beenproven strong in the learning process of bothsense and nonsense words (Howes and Solomon,1951; Solomon and Postman, 1952).
Frequencyhas also been shown to highly correlate with se-mantic factors, endorsing its importance, throughthe so called ?light verbs?
(Goldberg, 1999).In this study, we investigate whether wordsthat are more frequent have a higher chance ofearlier acquisition.
For this purpose, we com-pare data from children and adults, native speak-ers of Brazilian Portuguese, on an action namingtask, looking at lexical evolution, using statisticaland topological analysis of the data modeled asgraphs.
Our approach innovates in the sense thatit directly simulates the influence of a linguisticfactor over the process of lexical evolution.This paper is structured as follows.
Section 2describes related work.
Section 3 presents thematerials and methods employed.
Section 4presents the results and section 5 concludes.2 Related WorkSteyvers and Tenenbaum (2005), use some prop-erties of language networks to propose a modelof semantic growth, which is compatible with theeffects of age of acquisition and frequency, insemantic processing tasks.
The approach pro-posed in this paper follows Steyvers and Tenen-baum in the sense of iterative modifications ofgraphs, but differs in method (we use involutionsinstead of evolutions) and objective: modifica-tions are motivated by the study of frequencyinstead of production of a topological arrange-ment.
It also follows Deyne and Storms (2008),in directly relating linguistic factors and graphtheory metrics, and Coronges et al (2007), incomparing networks of different populations.This study also follows Tonietto et al (2008)in using data from a psycholinguistic action nam-ing task.
However, the analysis is done in termsof graph manipulation, instead of pure statistics.3 Materials and Methods3.1 The DataThe action naming task was performed by differ-ent age groups: 55 children and 55 young adults.Children?s data are longitudinal; partic ipants ofthe first data collection (G1) aged between 2;0and 3;11 (average 3;1), and in the second collec-tion (G2), between 4;1 and 6;6 (average 5;5) asdescribed by Tonietto et al (2008).
The adultgroup is unrelated to the children, and aged be-tween 17;0 and 34;0 (average 21;8).
Participantswere shown 17 actions of destruction or division(Tonietto et al 2008) and asked to describe it.19Data processing and justification of the chosendomain are described in Germann et al (2010).The answers given by each participant werecollected and annotated with two frequencyscores, each calculated from a different source.The first, Fscore, is the number of occurrences ofthe verb in the ?Florian?polis?
corpus (Scliar-Cabral, 1993; MacWhinney, 2000).
The second,Yscore, is the number of given results searchingfor the infinitive form of the verb in the ?Ya-hoo!"
Searcher (http://br.yahoo.com).
In the ad-vanced settings, ?Brazil?
was selected as countryand ?Portuguese?
as language.
Information aboutthese two scores for each group is shown in Ta-ble 1.G1 G2 G3Averagetype Fscore 44.05 35.92 17.84Averagetoken  Fscore43.44 35.71 21.22Averagetype Yscore15441904 18443193 10419263Averagetoken Yscore 10788194 9277047 8927866aTable 1: Type and token scores1.All scores but type Yscore, decrease as age in-creases, which is compatible with the hypothesisinvestigated.3.2 Simulation DynamicsLinguistic production of each group was ex-pressed in terms of graphs, whose nodesrepresent the mentioned verbs.
All verbs utteredfor the same video were assumed share semanticinformation, and then linked together, forming a(clique) subgraph.
The subgraphs were then con-nected in a merging step, through the words ut-tered for more than one video.To investigate the influence of frequency onthe language acquisition process, we used it tochange the network over time.
Network involu-tion, the strategy adopted, works in the oppositeway than network growth (Albert and Barab?si,2002).
Instead of adding nodes, it takes an oldergroup graph as the source and decides on thenodes to iteratively remove (taking the youngergroup graph only as a reference for comparison).Verbs were ranked in increasing order of fre-quency.
At each step of graph involution, the lessfrequent verb was selected to be removed, and1 Given the measure magnitude, values of Yscore were pre-sented without the decimal fraction.the resulting graph was measured.
Results arereported in terms of the averages of 10-foldcross-validation (because ties imply in randomselection).Graph theory metrics were used to measurestructural similarity: average minimal path length(L), density (D), average node connectivity (k)and average clustering coefficient (C/s)2.
In theinvolution, k and D, measure semantic share,since that is what relations among nodes are sup-posed to mean (see above).
L and C/s are in-tended to measure vocabulary uniformity, sincegreater distances and lower clusterization arerelated to the presence of subcenters of meaning.In order to compare the contents of each graphas well, we employed a measure of set similarity:Jaccard?s similarity coefficient (Jaccard, 1901).Given two sets A and B, the Jaccard?s coefficientJ can be calculated as follows:,where ?x?
is the number of elements in both Aand B, ?y?
is the number of elements only in A,and ?z?
is the number of elements only in B.4 Simulation ResultsAs we remove the verbs with lower frequencyfrom the graph of an older group, the overallstructure should approximate to that of a youngergroup, and both should get more similar concern-ing content.
Therefore, the most relevant part ofeach chart is the begging: the first removed verbsare expected to be those that differentiate graphs.4.1 Network Involution TopologyThe graph theory metrics are shown in Figures 1and 2 in terms of 2 lines: network involution (a)by using the selected criterion, and (b) by usingrandom selection (10-fold cross validation).
Inaddition, each figure also shows the measure forthe younger group as reference (a dashed,straight, thick line).In Figure 1, columns represent a graph theorymetric, and rows represent the use of a differentscore.
Each legend refers to all charts.The results for the simulations from G2 to G1,(Figure 1) show that the four metrics are clearlydistinct from random elimination from the be-ginning, indicating that frequency plays a role inthe process.
C/s is particularly distinct from ran-2 We adopted the local clustering coefficient of Watts andStrogatz (1998), but as the graphs may become discon-nected during network modification, this value is furtherdivided by the number of disconnected subgraphs.20dom: while the former remains constant almostto the end, indicating a highly structured (clus-tered) graph, the later shows effects of graph par-titioning.
The remaining metrics presented theirgreatest approximations to the reference line be-fore the middle of the chart, suggesting that theinitial verbs were actually the ones differentiat-ing both graphs.
These results suggest an initialincrease in semantic share, as k and D increase,and in uniformity, as nodes get closer to oneanother (L) and remain clustered (C/s).
In Figure2, the same tendencies are maintained, althoughnot as clearly as the previous results.
The great-est approximations of k and D happen in the firsthalf of the chart, but in a smoother way.
C/s stillbehaves steadily, remaining stable during mostof the simulation.
Yscore resembles Fscore (thesame way as in Figure 1), and was not presenteddue to space restrictions.4.2 Network Involution Set SimilarityIn the Jaccard?s coefficient charts, a rise or stabi-lization means that ?different verbs?
(presentonly in the older graph) were eliminated (in-creasing set similarity), and a descent means that?common verbs?
(present in both graphs) wereeliminated instead.Charts for ?excluded different?
and ?excludedcommon?
verbs (and their random counterparts)are presented in percentage.
By doing so, it ispossible to measure the exact evolution of both,despite the proportion between them (there aremuch more ?common?
than ?different?
verbs).
Arise in the ?Excluded Different?
line means thatsets are getting similar, while stabilization (des-cents are not possible) means that they are get-ting different.
The opposite applies to the ?Ex-cluded Common?
line.In the figures, charts are arranged in columns(the score being used) and rows (the parameterbeing measured).
Each legend is particular toeach row (one to Jaccard?s coefficient and anoth-er to the excluded verbs).Both simulation sets (Figures 3 and 4) confirmthe expected pattern in general: an initial in-crease in the proportion between "different" and?common?
verbs.
In Figure 3, Yscore presents anunexpected descent just before the middle, fol-lowed by a sharp rise.
Since the greatest descenthappens just in the end, we interpret this middledescent as data noise.
In Figure 4, Fscorepresents an almost random result, indicating thatthe score had low impact in content similarity forthis simulation.
Fscore in Figure 3 and Yscore inFigure 4 behaved as expected, with most ?differ-Figure 1.

Jaccard?s coefficient follows the samepattern.5 Conclusions and Future WorkThis study has investigated the influence of fre-quency on verb acquisition and organization us-ing both graph and set theory metrics.
In general,results from the topological analysis showed atendency towards the reference value, and thegreatest similarities were mostly collected in thebeginning, pointing for a preference of childrento use verbs more frequently perceived in thelanguage.
So we conclude that both the model ofinvolution and the given analysis are appropriatefor linguistic studies concerning vocabulary evo-lution3.3 Since the measures were taken from the whole graph, it isnot possible to determine a measure of significance.
How-ever, the comparisons with random elimination can be seenFor future work, we intend to apply the sameapproach to other parameters, such as concrete-ness, and syntactic complexity (and combina-tions, and to investigate lexical dissolution in thecontext of pathologies, such as Alzheimer?s dis-ease, and in larger data sets, in order to furtherconfirm the results obtained so far.AcknowledgmentsThis research was partly supported by CNPq(Projects 479824/2009-6 and 309569/2009-5),FINEP and SEBRAE (COMUNICA project FI-NEP/SEBRAE 1194/07).
