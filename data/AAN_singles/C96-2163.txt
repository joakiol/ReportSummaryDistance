jpAbst ract\[n the field of statistical analysis ofnatural language data, the measure ofword/class association has proved to bequite useful for discovering a meaning-tiff sense cluster in an arbitrary levelof the thesaurus.
In this paper, weapply its idea to the sense classifica-tion of Japanese verbal polysemy in caseframe acquisition from Japanese-Englishparallel corpora.
Measures of bilin-gual class~class association and bilingualclass/frame association are introducedand used for discovering sense clustersin the sense distribution of English pred-icates and Japanese case element nouns.In a small experiment, 93.3% of the dis-covered clusters are correct in that noneof them contains examples of more thanone hand-classified senses.1 In t roduct ionIn corpus-based NLP, acquisition of lexical knowl-edge has become one of the major research topics.Among several research topics in this field, acqui-sition from parallel corpora is quite attractive (e.g.Dagan et al (1991)).
The reason is that paral-lel sentences are useful for resolving both syn-tactic and lexical ambiguities in the monolingualsentences.
Especially if the two languages havedifferent syntactic structures and word meanings(such as English and Japanese), this approachhas proved to be most effective in disambigua-tion (Matsumoto et al, 1993; Utsuro et al, 1993).Utsuro et al (1993) proposed a method for ac-quiring surface case frames of Japanese verbsfrom Japanese-English parallel corpora.
In thismethod, translated English verbs and case labelsare used to classify senses of Japanese polysemousverbs.
Clues to sense classification are found us-ing English verbs and case labels, as well as thesense distribution of the Japanese case element*The author would like to thank Prof. Yuji MAT-SUMOTO for his valuable comments on this research.This work is partly supported by the Grants from theMinistry of Education, Science, and Culture, Japan,~07780326.nouns.
Then, a human instructor judges whetherthe clues are correct.
One of the major disadvan-tages of the method is that the use of English in-formation and sense distribution of Japanese caseelement nouns is restricted.
Only surface forms ofEnglish verbs and case labels are used and sensedistribution of English verbs is not used.
Also, thethreshold of deciding a distinction in the sense dis-tribution of Japanese case element nouns is prede-termined on a fixed level in a Japanese thesaurus.As a result, the human instructor is frequentlyasked to judge the correctness of the clue.In the field of statistical analysis of naturallanguage data, it is common to use measuresof lexical association, such as the information-theoretic measure of mutual information, to ex-tract useful relationships between words (e.g.Church and Hanks (1990)).
Lexical associationhas its limits, however, since often either thedata is insufficient o provide reliable word/wordcorrespondences, or the task requires more ab-straction than word/word correspondences per-mit.
Thus, Resnik (1992) proposed a useful mea~sure of word/class association by generalizinginformation-theoretic measure of word/word asso-ciation.
The proposed measure addresses the lim-itations of lexical association by facilitating sta~tistical discovery of facts involving word classesrather than individual words.We find the measure of word/class associa-tion of Resnik (1992) is quite attractive, since itis possible to discover a meaningful sense club-ter in an arbitrary level of the thesaurus.
Wethus expect that the restrictions of the previ-ous method of Utsuro et al (1993) can be Over-come by employing the idea of the measure ofword/class association.
In this paper, we de-scribe how this idea can be applied to the senseclassification of Japanese verbal polysemy in caseframe acquisition from Japanese-English parallelcorpora.
First, sense distribution of English pred-icates and Japanese case element nouns is repre-sented using monolingual English and Japanesethesaurus, respectively (sections 2 and 3).
Then,the measure of the association of classes of En-glish predicates and Japanese case element nouns,i.e., a measure of bilingual class~class associa-tion, is introduced, and extended into a measureof bilingual class/frame association (section 4).968Using these measures, sense clusters are discov-ered in the.
sense distribution of English predicatesand ,lapanese ease element nouns.
Finally, ex-amples of a Japanese polysemous verb collectedfrom ,/apanese-l'\]nglish parallel corpora are cli-vided into disjoint clusters according to those dis-covered sense clusters (section 5).
The results of asmall experiment are presented and the proposedmeasure is evaluated (section 6).2 Bil ingual Surface Case StructureIn the framework of verbal case frame acquisitionfi'om parallel corpora, bilingually matched surfacecase structures (Matsumoto eta\[ .
,  1993) are col-lected and surface case frames of Japanese verbsare acquired ti'om the collection, in this paper,each bilingually matched surface case structure is(:ailed a bilingual surface case structure, and rep-resented as a feature structure:p'red : vasemu : SEMi ,pl : sere : SEMal:P'" : sere : ,5'EMa,~vj  in(licat(~s the verb in the Japanese sentence,P l , .

When a .Japanese noun n j i  tins severalsenses, it may appear in several eaf classes in the,lapanese thesaurus.
Thus, St' ;Mai is representedas a. set of" those classes, and is referred to as a se-mant ic  label.

In Roget's Thesaurus, the verb "han.q"has four senses.
In BGH, the nouns "watash, i"and "uwagi" have only one sense, respectively, and"kagi" has four senses.3 Monolingual ThesaurusA thesaurus is regarded as a tree in which eachnode represents a class.
We introduce ~ as thesuperordinate-subordinate relation of closes.

We define -/ so that a semantic label SEM={c l , .

Roget's l hesalrus has a seven-layered abstraction hierarchy and over 100,000words are allocated at the leaves a.
In Roget's The-saurus, sense classification is preferred to part ofspeech distinction.
Thus, a noun and a verb whichhave similar senses are assigned similar classes inthe thesanrus.4 C lass -based Assoc ia t ion  Score4.1 Word/Class Association ScoreThe measure of word/class association ofResnik (1992) can be illustrated by the problemof finding tile prototypical object classes for verbs.Let )2 and A/" be the sets of all verbs and norms,respectively.

First ,  we assume that  for any polyse-mous Japanese verb v j ,  there exists a case markerp which is most effective for sense classificationof v j .
Given the collection of bil ingual surfacecase structures for v j ,  we introduce the bilingualclass/class association score for measuring the as-sociation of a class cE of English predicates and aclass c j  of Japanese case element nouns for a casemarker p.Let Eg(vg,p) be the set of bil ingual sur-face case structures collected fronl the Japanese-English paral lel  corpora,  each element of whichhas a Japanese verb v j  and a Japanese casemarker p. Among the elements of Eg(vj,p), letEg(vj,p,c~) be the set of those whose seman-tic label SEME of the English predicate satisfiesthe class c~, i.e., SEME ~ cE, and Eg(vj ,p/c j )be the set of those whose semantic label SEMjof the Japanese case element noun for the casemarker p satisfies the class c j ,  i.e., SEMjcj .
Let l ' ;g(vj,cE,p/cj) be the intersection ofEg(vj, p, c~i) and Eg(vj, p/cj).
Then, condit ionalprobabi l i t ies Pr(cE Ira,p),  Pr (c j  I va,p), andPr(cE,cj I vj ,p) are defined as the ratios of thenumbers of the elements of those sets:\[Eg(vJ,p, cE)\[pr(c  -Pr(,:,, I v J ,p)  -IE (v ,p)IPr(cE,cJ I vj,p) = \]Eg(v ,p) lThen, given v j  and p, the associat ion scoreA(c~,., cj I v j ,p )  of cE and c j  is defined asA(cE,cj \[ vj,p) =Pr(cs, c~ I v j ,p )Pr(e~,c j  I v.l,p)log Pr(cE \[vj,p)Pr(cj I vj,p)This definition is sl ightly different from that  ofthe word/c lass associat ion score in that  it onlyneeds the set Eg(vj,p) for a Japanese verb vyand a Japanese case marker  p, but not the whole3apanese-Engl ish parallel corpora.
This is be-cause our task is to discover strong associat ion ofan English (:lass and a Japanese class in Eg(vj,p),rather than in the whole Japanese-Engl ish paral-lel corpora.
Besides, as the first term for mea-snring the general ity of the association, we usePr(cE,cj \[ vj ,p) instead of Pr(c,, I v j ,p,  cl~) orPr(c~ \ [vj ,p/cj)  below:*IEg/- , IPr(cz \[ v j ,p ,  cE) =Pr(cE \[ vj,p/cj) =4.3 Bilingual Class/Frame AssociationScoreIn the previous section, we assume that  for anypolysemous Japanese verb v j ,  there exists a casemarker  p which is most effective for sense classi-fication of verbal polysemy v j .
However, it canhappen that  a combinat ion of more than one easemarker  characterizes a sense of the verbal poly-senly v j .
Even if there exists exact ly one casemarker  which is most effective for sense classifi-cation, it is necessary to select the most effectivecase marker  automat ica l ly  by some measure.
Forexample, using some measure, it is desirable toautomat ica l ly  discover the fact that,  for the taskof sense classification of verbal polysenry, subjectnouns are usually nlost effective for intransit iveverbs, while object  nouns are usual ly most effec-tive for transit ive verbs.This section generalizes the previous defini-t ion of bilingual class/class association score, andintroduces the bilingual class/frame associationscore.
In the new definition, we consider everypossible set of pairs of a Japanese case markerp and a Japanese noun class c j ,  instead of pre-determining the most effective case marker.
Thebilingual class/frame association score measuresthe associat ion of an English class c~ and a set ofpairs of a Japanese case marker  p and a Japanesenoun class cs marked by p. By searching for alarge associat ion score, it becomes possible to findany combinat ion of case markers which character-izes a sense of the verbal polysemy vs.4.3.1 Japanese  Case-C lass  F rameFirst ,  we introduce a data  structure which rep-resents a set of pairs of Japanese case marker p anda Japanese noun class cj marked by p, and call it;Japanese case-class frame.
A Japanese case-classframe can be represented as a feature structure:Pm : CJm4pr(cd \[ v j ,p,  cE) and Pr(eE I v j ,p/cd)  are toolarge in lower parts of the thesaurus, since we focusoi1 examples which have a Japanese verb v.l and aJapanese case marker p. When we used the averageof Pr(ej  I vJ,p, cE) and Pr(e~ \[ vj,p/cj) instead ofPr(eE, cj \] vj,p) in the experiment d section 6, mostdiscovered clusters consisted of only one example.9704.3.2 Subsumption RelationNext, we introduce subsuraption relation ~/ 'o f  ~a bilingual surface case structure  and a Japaneseease-class frame fa:e ~f f3 iff.
for each case marker p in f's andits noun class c's, there existsthe same case marker p in e andits semantic babel SEMj  is sub-ordinate to ca, i.e.
SEM'S ~ caThis definition can be easily extended into a sub-snmption relation of Japanese case-class frames.4.3.3 Bilingual Class/Prame AssociationScoreLet Eg(va) be the set of bilingual surface casestrnctures collected from the Japanese-Englishparallel corpora, each element of which has aJapanese verb va.
Among the elements e ofEg(va), let Eg(va,cE) be the set of those whosesemantic label SEME of the English predicatesatisfies the class cE, i.e., SEME ~ cE, andEg(vj,  fd) be the set of those which satisfy theJapanese case-class frame fa, i.e., e ~f  f j .
LetEg(vj,cf,;, fa) be the intersection of Eg(va,cE)and Eg(va, fa).
Then, conditional probabilities1','(c~: Iv j) ,  Pr ( fa  ira), and I ' r (cm f j i va)  are de-fined as the ratios of the numbers of the elementsof those sets:\[)I'(CE I V J) -- \ ]~(V j ) lt',.
(S's I v , )  - iEv(~'s) IPr(c~:, f's I~a) =Then, given va, the association score A(cE, fa lV'S) of cg and f j  is defined asA(cF,, f,, Iv,s) =PI"(CE, f'S I~'s)Pr(es,:, f,, Iva) log Pr(c~ I v's)Pr(f's I v's)As well as the case of the bilingual class/classassociation score, this definition only needs theset Eg('va) for a Japanese verb va, not the wholeJapanese-English parallel corpora.5 Sense Classi f icat ion of VerbalPo lysemyThis section explains how to classify the elementsof the set l')g(va) of bilingual surface case struc-tures according to the sense of the verbal poly-scaly va, with the bilingual class/frame associ-ation score defined in the previous section, hithis classification process, pairs of an English classcz,: and a Japanese case-class frame f j  which givelarge association score A(cE, fa ira) are searchedfor.
It is desirable that the set Eg(vj)  be dividedinto disjoint subsets by the discovered pairs of cuand fa.
The classification process proceeds ac-cording to the following steps:1.
First, the index i and the set of examples Egare initialized as i ~- \] and Eg *- Eg(va).2.
For the i-th iteration, let cE and fa be a pairof an English class and a Japanese case-classframe which satisfy the following constraintfor all the pairs ofcEj and f j j  ( l< j< i -  1.
):csu is not subordinate nor superordinate tocEj (i.e., cF, ~ cEj and cEj ~ cE), or fa is notsubordinate nor superordinate to faj (i.e.,fJ 74 1 faj and f j j  Z f  fa).
Then, amongthose pairs of c~ and f j, search for a paireel and fJi which gives maximum associationscore max A(cE, fa Iv j), a and collect the ele- cE ,fjments of Eg which satisfy the restrictions ofCEi and fJi into the set Eg(va, eel, f.'i).3.
Subtract the set Eg(va, cu~, fJi) from Eg asEg +-- Eg - Eg(va, eel, fal).
If Eg 7~ O, thenincrement he index i as i +-- i + 1 and go tostep 2.
Otherwise, set the number k of thesubsets as k +- i and terminate the class/flea-.t/on process.As the result of this classification process, theset Eg(vj)  is divided into disjoint subsets Eg(vj ,cNl, fdl), ..., Eg(v2, cEk, fak).
6 For example, ifa Japanese polysemous verb vg has both intran-sitive and transitive senses, pairs with the sub-ject case like (era, \[subj : Cjl\]),... , <CEk, \[s~l.bj :oak,\]) will be discovered for intransitive senses,while pairs with the object case like (cEk,~ l, \[obj:Cdk, ,q \ ] ) , .
.
.
,  (cEk, \[obj :csk\]) will be discovered fortransitive senses.Given tile set Eg(va), the iterations of the as-sociation score calculation is O(IEg('oa)t) ~.
Sincethe classification process can be regarded as sort-ing the calculated association score, its COnlputa-tional complexity can be O(IEg(vj) I log IEg(~j)l )if efficient sorting algorithms such as quick sortare employed.6 Exper iment  and Eva luat ionThis section gives the results of a small exper-5The association score A(CS~,fjIvj) is calculatedfrom the whole set Eg(v's), not Eg.6Although the classification process itself guaran-tees the disjointness of Eg(va, eel, f'sl), ..., Eg(vj,CEk, fJk), the subordinate-superordinate constraint ofc,,~, and f j  in the step 2 also guarantees the disjoint-ness of the example sets which satisfy the restrictionsof me p~irs (c~,DJ,.

As a Japanese-English parallel corpus, weuse a corpus of about 40,000 translation exam-ples extracted h'om a machine readable Japanese-English dictionary (Shimizu and Narita, 1979).6.1 Example  of  kauFirst, we show the result of classifying 75 examples(represented as bilingual surface ease structures)of the Japanese polysemous verb kau.As the result of searching for pairs of an Englishclass and a Japanese case-class frame with a largeassociation score, the wo case (the accusative case)is preferred as the most effective case for senseclassification.
15 pairs of an English class and aJapanese case-class frame are found and the setof the 75 examples are divided into 15 disjointclusters (Table 1).
Each cluster is represented asa pair of the class c~ of the English predicates andthe class ca of the Japanese case element nouns ofwo case, along with the level of the class in thethesaurus and the example word.
English classesare taken from Roget's Thesaurus and Japaneseclasses fi'om BGH s. In both thesauri, leaf classesSThe classes of BGH are represented as numer-correspond to one word.For the evaluation of the results, we hand-classified the 15 clusters into four groups, eachof which corresponds to only one sense of kau 9.Most hand-classified clusters for kau consist ofmore than one clusters found by maximizing theassociation score.
However, these clusters are cot-rect in that none of them contains examples ofmore than one hand-classified senses of kau.6.2 Examples  of In t rans i t i ve /Trans i t i veD is t inct ionFor four Japanese verbs haru, hiku, hiraku, andkanau, Table 2 shows examples of classifying in-transitive/transitive senses by the proposed senseicM codes, in which each digit denotes the choiceof the branch in the thesaurus.

(;77 Conc lus ionThis pal)er proposed a t)ilingual class-basedmethod for sense classification of verbal i)olysemy,which is based on the maximizat ion of the bilin-gual c lass/ f rame associat ion score.
It achievedfairly high accuracy, although it is necessary tofarther merge the clusters so that  exactly one clus--ter corresponds to one hand-classif ied sense.
Weare planning to make exper iments on sense classi-f ication without bi l ingual information to evaluatethe e.lt'ectiveness of such bil ingual information.li'or 9 verl)s, we made an ext)eriment on senseclassification of verbal polysemy.
We comparedthe result with the hand-classif ication a d checkedwhether each cluster contained examples of onlyone hand-classit ied sense (Table 3).
In the ta-ble, 'CI. '
and 'lEg.'
indicate the numbers of ellis=ters and examples, respectively.
The column 'OneSense (J luster' means that  each cluster containsexamples of only one hand-classif ied sense, andthe sub-eohmms 'CI. '
and 'Eg. '
list the number ofSlLch (:lusters and the sum of examples containedin such clusters, respectively.
We ewduated theaccuracy of the method am the rate of the num-ber of examples contained in one sense clustersas in the 'Eg. '
sub-eohmm.
This achieved 100%accuracy for four verbs out of the 9 verbs, and93.3% in average.
The coluinn 'Total  C1./Hand-Classif.'
indicates the ratio of the total  number ofclusters to the number of hand-classif ied senses,correspoading to the average number of clnstersinto which one hand-classif ied sense is divided.
Itsa, verag% median, and standard deviat ion are 2.46,1.80, and 1.06, respectively.The result of the exper iment indicated that  thet)r<)posed sense classif ication method has achievedalmost pure classification, while the result seems al ittle liner than hand-elassit ieation.
This is mainlycause<l by the Net that  clusters which correspondto the same hand-classif ied sense are separatelylocated in the human-made thesaurus, and it isnot easy to find exact ly one representat ive classin the thesaurus (Utsuro, 11995).
It is necessaryto further merge the clusters so that  exact ly onecluster corresponds to one hand-classif ied sense.ReferencesK.
