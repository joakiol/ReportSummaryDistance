A se t  of labels isassociated with each segment of the string, and several func-tions permit control of the number of alternative labels.CETA simulates a transformatianal grammar.
It uses a set o fgrammars with conditional linkages.
The applicabili&y of atransformation can be determined in p a r t  by conditions on theresulting t ree.Computer processing 3f natural languages requires more orless polished algorithmic models.
The two systems presentedhere represent a choice of a large class among the algorithmsproposed in recent years to solve these problems.
The prin-c ipa l  choice determined by these systems l i e s  in the formal useof labeled trees ( arborescences ) .
Freedom of choice of thesela-bels and possible structures gives these systems broad fieldsof applications in several domains and notably in that of theautomatic processing of natural languages.
The ATEF system hasthe purpose of transformFng a string of words into a tree whichis manipulable by the CETA system.
The definition of labeledtrees determines what objects CETA can manipulate and the objec-ti'ves of ATEF.
This note therefore begins with the definitionof labeled trees.
To obtain a tree of this type beginning withan input string, ArEF uses a dictionary and a finite-state gram-mar.
The result of this system can be manipulated by CETA inorder to obtain the desired type of structure.
T h e  example ofanalysis given here shows the  possibilities of the CETA systemw?th two different manipulative strategies: search for consti-tuent or dependency structure .1, LABELED TREESA rree is a set of points with which is associated a struc-ture, that is to say a relation having the properties:The relation between two points is directed (onepoint depends on the other )A point Cannot depend on a point belonging to itsown descent set (the descent set of a point is theset of points that depend on it, the points thatdepend on them, etc.
)A unique point descends from no other.It is possible to draw a tree placing below a point all of itsdescendants, linked by lines.
(See the example on the nextframe.
)A labeled tree is a tree such that with each of its pointsis associated a lab-el This label IS formed of a set of data.The figure below represents a labeled tree.fernthe,-nom commurr feminin, sin&ul.ierune, article irresisxible jeur~e r o u s s eindef ini, f eminin adjectif, fcr-ir,iri adjectif, feminin adjectif,couleursingulier singu*ier singulier f5minin,singulier.derivationnegative duverbe resistervers  I adjemlf7: T - E  ATEF SYSTEMThe purpose of the ATEF system is to transform an inputsming of words i n t o  a labeled t r e e ,  each word in the stringp o s s i b l y , l e a d i n g  to one or several points in the final tree(ambiguity).
The determination of the label originating in aninput word results from its analysis.
This analysis proceedsby segme~tation of the input  word according t o  elements f r o md i f f e r e n t  dictional:  ies .
A correct segmentation therefore gives.a label for a p o i n t  of the  f i n a l  tree .
Tn advance of any.analysis, the definition of the elements employed in the compo-sition of different labels is required and is supplied by twoEiles called variable declaration files.A label will consist of a set bf variables.
Each variablemust be defined with its set of possible values.
Thus if onedefines the variable "category" the set of "categories" thatcan be used must be specified.
The set is writ tencategory = (NOUN, ARTICLE, PRONOUN, ADJECTIVE, VERB, .
.
.
)(A constraint requires that the name of a variable must not belonger than 7 characters.
Thus the preceding var2able could bewritten, for example, CAT = (NN, ART, Pm, ADJ, VRB, .
.
. )
)The definitdon of a particular label consists in an enume-ration of the variables relevant to the  label.
A se t  of labelscan be predefined and is collected in a so-called format file.The ATEF system analyzes the words and thus employs dictionariesA dictionary is a set of segments (character strings), ~ t h  eachof which is associated a label, a processing pointer, and alexical unit pointer.
The processing pointer specifies the par-ticular process which must be associated with the segment.The analysis of the input word by the ATEF system residesat first in a label processing, that is to say in an evolutionof the empty label toward a final label characteristic of theanalyzed word This evolution is controlled by the grammar,which at each moment has access to two labels.
the label beingdeveloped (noted by the symbol C) and the  label associated w i t hthe segment which was read in the dictionary (noted by A) Theanalysis of a word aims to produce a segmentation of t h e  worusimultaneously compatible with the segments of the di f ferentdictionaries (the word must be an assembly of dictionary seg-ments) and compatible with a correct evolution of the grammarThus the segmentation of the input ~ o r d  is tighcly bound tothe evolution of the grammar which controls the coherence ofthe segmentation In the course of a segmentation operationthe state of the system takes into account for the analyzedwordthe  label resuLting from the analysis of thesegments a l ~ e a d y  obtarned for this wordthe label associated with  the segment foundin a dictlonarythe remaining characters of the input wordthe complete form of the i n p u t  wordThus for example in the course of the analysis of theword irresistible and after analysis of the segment " ib le"and in the course of reading the segment 'resist1' thefollowing erements are obtainedC the label resulting from the analysis of "ible"This label contains for example the v a r i a b l ederivation with value verb-adj, the variablegender with value masculine and feminine, thevariable number with value singular.A the label associated with  the segment''resistT h i s  label coatains notably the lexical unit"resister", the varlable category with value verbThe character$ IRThe complete form IRRESISTIBLEThe purpose of the grammar is to permit or prevent theevolution of label C starting wlth label A Here, the l abe lwill evolve and obtaln the variable category wlth value adjec-tive.
A rule associated with the segment "resist" by means ofits pointer will therefore describe this evolution of the labelC.
When no evolution of the label C is possible, the corres-ponding segmentation is blocked and considered nonsignificant.The set of labels plays a fundamental role in this systemand forms the s e t  of s t s ~ t e s  o f  the f i n i t e  state transducercorresponding to the l og i ca l  model of the system Each coherentsegmentation of a word (a word can have several coherent segmen-tations leading to ambiguities) provides a labeled point in thefinal tree Three elements are fundamental to the systemthe choice and evolution of the segmentationthe calculation of the set of labels associatedwith a wordthe positioning of the labeled points created bythe analysis of a word in the final treeThe choice and evolution of the segmentation has to do withthe sequence of input characters.
The segmentation forces,above all, a prior linguistic choice.
Thus with the segment "UN"two possibilities can be conceivedeither accept "UN E" as a coherent segmentationor have the segment "Ul?E" in the dictionary andrefuse the segmentation "UN El'For each initial form several segmentations are possibleto arrive at the same results arid only a linguie tic study ofthe phenomena permits a decision on the strategy to be adopted.In any event, this stLategy is left to the user of the systemIn the course of a segmentation the system can operate d~rectlyon the nonsegmented chatacters in order to force them into a"canonical'!
form.
Thus in the case of the word reel severalpossib~lities arise to accept a word like realiteput the segment "real" in a dictionary as well asthe segmenf "reel", the former will generate wordslike realite, irrealite, e t c .put the single segment "reel" in the dictionary andthe analysis of the word realite Qill follow theschemarealit& => 1st segment found "lte", remainder "real"mddificat&on r ea l  ->r&el => 2nd segment found "reel"segmentation .
"riSel it&"N B In thls analysis, it is to be noted that thesearch for successive segqents is performed fromleft to right ?ox the input word.
This depends onthe strategy adopted and, for a given use, thedirection of the segmentatson of a word can be eitherleft to right or right to l e f t .To avoid a proliferation of possible segmentations and there-fore of possible solutions, several functions provide for inter-vention in the segmentation A first possibility is offered b : ~the management of  the dictionaries In fact, the system includesseveral dictionaries and after isolation of each segment theI I system can open" or "close" a dictionaryThis method makes it easy to avoid, for example, looking?or two consecutive prefixes.
Another mode of interventionuhich is more d i r e c t ,  i s  peovided by the presence of functionsacting on the enumeration procedures by which the system counts~ f f  solutions.
For example, t h e  system analyzes a l l  possiblesegmentations starting with a given segment beginning with thesegmentations containing most characters.
An intervention atthis level makes i t  possible h o t  t o  analyze but to reject sub-segmentations of P segment.
The analysis of the segment "UNE"can, for example, r e j e c t  the analysis of the  subsegment "UN E"(Observe that the segmentation of the word "chacune" will thenbe obtained as G A C  UNE because th8 segmentation CHACUN E will.
berejected as a subsegmentation of "UNE" This problem can easilybe resolved because these  functions appear in the  rules of thegrammar and are consequently conditional.
One can at the sametime f"orbid the subsegmentation "UN E-" in the word "UNE" andaur;horize this.
segmentatian in the word "CHACUNE")The calculation of the set of labels associated ~ i t h  a wordis produced and controled by the grammar.
This calculation cor-responds above all with a conditianal modification of the label Cor current state starting from the label A or argument state.The condition f o r  the  evolution of t h i s  label is such that if noevolution is possible then the corresponding segmentation Lsrejected.
This condition can refer to the labels of the pre-ceding analyzed words and can condition its result on the analysisof the following form.
Thus for example in the course of theanalysis of the word "LA" in the sequence "il la voit", thesegmentation taking "la" as art ic le  can be rejected.
The t rans-fer of information to di f fe ren t  labels can be realized througha s s i g n m e n t t o t h e  following label S .
When this label has beenassigned in  the course of the  analysis of a word the analysisof the follow'ing word w i l l  begin with the assigned label insteadef the null l a b e l .The final result of the system i s  a labeled tree.
With nosupplementary specification i n  the course o f  analysis, this treeappears in the following form:0'w ---- 4 3  w n Au .p - -- A fi, A >*s o l u t i o n  1 I s o l u t i o n  &phrase I p h ~ a s e  I phrase p phrase pThe solution for a sentence ( ~ h r a s e )  consists of a stringof labe l s  (one f o r  each word of the sentence), each of whichrepresents an interpretation of a ward of th i s  sentence.
Inthis case, the sentence is not structured; simply the ambiguitiesare sepa~ated.
Th t h e  course of the analysis  of the words, afirst sketch of a construct5an can be made and give as r e s u l t  am o r e  developed tree.
These functions spec i fy  the pos i t ion  thatthe point t o  which t h e  calculated mask applies must take in thefinal tree.
This position is determined in a l l  cases below ap o i n t  w, and is relative to the  root ( f i r s t  p o i n t  on the l e f tbelow wi) and to the rightmost p o i n t  of the tree already con-structed.
Thus this point can become itself the root, therightmost leaf, etc.With, for example, the  analysis of the string "une bellemaison", we can.
have1 1  during the analysis  of une", no t reeduring the analysis of "belle", the tree eontains thesingle point "une".
A function can render the point"belle" as root and give b e l l euneduring the analysis of "maison", if the constructedtree is belle,.
a function can provide for swappingw ethe root with t he  occurrence i n  work and give the treeune belle.In this case, the result f o r  the system w i l l  beune belle5 ,  THE CETA SYSTEMThe CETA system provides for writing and s5mulating atransformational grammar.
This system manipulates l a b e l e d  treesof the type described above ( l abe l ed  trees produced by the ATEFor other system).
To construct a transformational grammar withthis system two complementary elements are necessary:the set of rules used defines the s e t  of prfmitivesof the system for a given applicationThe set of grammars and the d e f i n i t i o n  of t he i rlinkage defines the mode of use of the primitivesThe definition of a transformation rule defines a mode ofpotential transformation of the tree considered.
A rule is de-fined by a le'fthand part representing the subtree to be modi-f i e d  and a righthand part defining the resulting subtree.

In t h e  example taken here, thei n p u t  tree is not very "deep" and most often only one-level treesare applicable.
However, in t he  course of development of a corn-plete structure, tshe considered tree is arbitrary and the defini-tion of a complex transformation constructed beginning withseveral subtrees is very refined.
The subtrees defined in arule can likewise be considered.

COCTA has organized panels atmany polirical science and socialogy associations, includingits formal, association with the C mparative InterdisciplinaryStudies Section of the International Studies Association asthe Internet on Conceptual and Terminological Analysis.
Overthe half-decade of its existence, COCTA has developed sever31separate stages of concepmal analysis including special focion metalinguistics, concept construction and reconstruction,and clarification of the theoretical usages of concepts.
Under-lying these and other interebts is a prerequisite need for aninventory of concepts-in-use.
The rationale for attempting todevelop the inventory, and discussion of its potential usages,are fully stated in my Commencement of a S y s t e m a t i c  C o n c e p tCOCTACozlection This statement sets  f o r t h  the description of theresulting official COCTA Concept inventory2.The inventory is a rather ambitious project that willdepend upon the contributions of interested scholars.
It willbegin with special focal points within political science andsociology as a pilot project.
The logic of this pilot collec-tion, however, is to provide a framework within which che col-lection can be expanded into other social sciences and relatedfields in the humanities.
The immediate task is to commencethe collection of social science concepts-in-use and to demon-strate the inventory's utility.
Since the inventory can becommenced on ly  by volunteers, the aid of scholars from severaldisciplines is essential to its success.
Any concepts can belisted by interested scholars.The present proceduxes for entering concepts into the in-ventory are simple.
Scholars in the fields record conceptsand related information according to the inventory's formatand mail them .tro me.

About 100 persons from Germany, Great Britain,Italy, Holland, Denmark, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway,Israel, Canada, and Japan attended.
They were teachers, stu-dents, or researchers with various fields of interest and1.UTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICSbackground: linguist$cs, psychology, philosophy, automatictranslation, computer science, social sciences, engineering.,etc.
The courses offered embraced a wide range of topics  re-l a t e d  t o  semantics.
Some of t h e m  w e r e  inrroductory courses,others were survey courses including the lecturers' own scien-tXic results and discussions of these in relation to recentresearch.
This variety of fields taught at different levelswas well su i t ed  to the audience.Below we will account for the lectures chronologically,describing at greater length those which were most relevantto usPARSING ENGLI S-H - Y o r i c k  WilksA survey and comparison of some of the better known A1systems, t h i s  course began with certain fundamental conceptsand general characteristics of relevance for all the-systemsin question.
A principal issue is parsing.
Wilks defined itas "prooedural ascription of structures to sentences, wherethe structures are pot smtactic at all, but semantic.
1 IParsing may be done in two different ways: TOP-DOWN or BOTTOM-UP.
Bottom up is the more straightforward way.
The words ofthe sentence are listed and each word is replaced by its cate-gory Then pairs o f  category symbols (for instance Verb + NP)are rewritten by reversing the grammar's rewrite rules (Verb +NP - - >  VP) until the final sentence symbol S is reached.
Thelines of the derivation can then be considered as the parsing.T U T O R I A L  ON COMPUTATIONAL S E M A N T I C S .Top-down parsing is the reverse procedure starting with thegenerations and continuing from left to right until the lastword is reached.
Another important pair of teahnical terms isBREADTH-FIRST and DEPTH-FIRST.
Breadth-f i rs t  is the para l le ltreatment of all possible alternative structures at a giventime, none of which is given precedence.
In depth-first pafses,,the akternative structures are treated sequentially.
So farthe description may apply to any kind of parsing, but it wasWilks's aim t o  demonstrate pars ing  procedures where the struc-tures are not syntactic but semantic.
He described his ownview of semantics as a version of the "meaning is procedures"attitude, i e. the procedures of its application give a pgrsedstructure its s-ignificance.After mentioning what he called the "problem of naturallang~sge", by which he meant the problem of systsmatic ambiguity,Wilks gave a brief historical sketch of the first approaches tomachine translation, the failure J ?
which he put down to theambiguity problem.Terry Winograd has proposed a distinction between "first"and "second" generation CI language systems.
This distinctionthat seems no* to be wfdely acceptad also lies behind the surveybelow, where the systems of Winograd and Woods are consideredfirst-generation and those of Simmons, Schank, Charniak, and Wilksbelong to the second ge~eration.
Winograd's well-known dialoguesystem SHRDLU operates in a closed world o f  colored blocks  andTUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIOhAL SEMANTICS 50pyrdmids.
The gratnmatj of SHRDLU is not the conventional listof rules but s ~ l l  subprograms that actually represent proceduresfor imposing the desired grammatical structure.
In terms of: thenotions set out earlier, Winograd's parsing is top-down anddepth-first.
After the syntactic parsing a number of "semanticspecialistst1 attach semantic structvres to specific syntacticstructures.
These semantic structures can then be used by thedeductive component of the system.
Woods's system, tob, isconsidered first-generation, but both Woods and Winograd haveargued that their systems are essentially equivalent, which isthe reason why Wilks described only one of them in detailWhat the second-generation systems have in common is theassumption that understanding.
systems-must be able to manipulatevery complex linguistic abjects, or semantic structures, and thatno simplistic approach to understanding language with computersrill work.
A common Peature in connection with second-generationsystems is what Rinsky (1974) c a l l s  a FRAME.
It is describedas a data-structure representing a stereotyped.
situation andattempting to specify in advance what is going to be said, andh~w.the world encountered is going to be structured.Colby s system, too, is a dialogue system, by which aninterview between a doctor and a paranoid patient called PARRYis carried out.
The input text is segmented by a heuristicthat breaks it at any occurrence of key words.
Patterns arethen matched with each word string segment.
Stored in the sameformat as the patterns are rules expressing the conseque-xesTUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS.f o ~  the 2atient of detecting aggression and overfriendliness inthe interviewer's questions and remarks.
The matched patternsare then tied directly, or via these inference rules, to cheresponse patterns which are generated.
A very interesting as-pect of the PARRY system is the fact that the answers of thesystem cannot be distinguished from those of a human patientThis fact suggests that many people on many occasions seem tounderstand the information they receive in the same way thatPARRY does.Schank's is a rich system of semanti.
: representation.
Itconsists of the following three components:1. an ANALYZER of English, due to Riesbeck2 .
a SEMANTIC MEMORY Component, due to Rieger3 .
a GENERATOR OF ENGLISH, due to GoldmanThe aim of Schank's system is to provide a representation ofmeaning in terms of which different kinds of analysis andmachine translation can be carried out; a representation, more-over, that is independent 0.f any particular language ,.
and ofsyntax, and, indeed, of all traces o f  surface structureAfter a detailed description of Schank's so-called CONCEP-TUALIZATIONS, built up by conceptual categories, primitive acts,cases, etc., Wi-lks gave his own comments an Schank's system.Like that of Schank, Wilks's system has a uniform represen-tation, in the shape of structures and primitives, for thecontent of natural language.
I t  is uniform in that t heTUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 52information that might conventionally be considered syntactic,semantic or factual is all represented within a single struc-ture of complex entities (called FORMULAS and P A R A P L A T E S ) ,  allof which are in turn constructed from 80 primitive semanticentities.
The formulas are tree structures of semantic primi-tives, stored in the dictionary of the system.
The main elementin any formula is its "head", i. e. t h e  fundamental category t owhich the  formula belongs.
Sentences and their parts are repre-sented by the socalled TEMPLATE STRUCTURES, built up as networksof formulas.
Templates always consist of an agent node, anaction node, and an object node, and other nodes that may begoverned by these.
A formula o r ,  say, the noun.
"drinkl' canbe thought of as an entity at a template action node, selectinga liquid object, that is to say a formula with FLOW STUFF asits head, to be put at the object node of the template (sentencestructure).
This seeking is preferential in that formulas notsatisfying a given requirement will be accepted, but only ifnothing satsifying it can be found.
The template ultimatelyestablished for a fragment of text is the one in which the mostformulas have their preferences satisfied.
This preferenceprinciple is of essential importance in connection with solvingthe many ambiguity problems in natural language texts.
Whenthe local.
inferences have been done that s e t  up the agentraction-object templates for fragments of input text, the systemattempts to tie these templates together so as to provide anoverall initial structure for the inaut called a CASE TIE.TUTORIAL ON CUMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 53Case ties are made with the aid of angther class of orderedstructures called PARAPLATES, each of which is a string offunctions that seek inside templates for information.
Thelast step in the parsing is the inference procedure in whichcommonsense inference rules attempt by a simple strategy toconstruct the shortest possible chain of rule-linked templateforms, on the principle of preference.The other main section of this course was a comparison ofthe parsing systeps described, including Charniak's system.This,comparison was based on the following principal aspects:LEVEL O F  REPRESENTATION.
At this point there qre two Op-posite views: that language can be realized or represented atdifferent levels depending on the subject matter, or that theappropriate level of computation for inferences about naturallanguage has to be to some degree reduced.
The different levelattitude is supported mainly by Colby and Charniak, whileSchank and Wilks hold that a certain primitivization is necessaryCENTRANTY OF INFORMATION.
This aspect concerns the degreeof s p e c i f i c i t y  of the information required.
Some systems, IikeCharniak's, are based on in fomat ion  highly specific to particu-lar situations, while the sorts of information central toSohank's and Wilks's systems are of a much niore general nature,consisting mainly of partial assertions about hman wants,expectations, and so on.
This problep of centrality is ofgreat theoretecal importance, which Wflks illustrated by anexample: A person might know nothing of a particular type ofTUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 54situation, for instance a birthday party, but could not forthis reason be accused of not understanding the language.
Yet,if he did not have available some very general inference suchas for instance people gettihg sleepy at night, then it ispossible that his failure to understand quite srmple sentenceswould cause observers to think that he did not know the lan-guage.
Wilks went on:An interesting and difficult question that thenarises is whether those who concentrate on centraland less central areas of discourse could, in principle,weld their bodies of inference together in such a wayas to create a wider system; whether, to put the matteranother way, natural language is a whole that can bebuilt up f r ~ m  parts.PHENOMENOLOGICAL LEVEL.
This is a question of degree ofexplicitness.
Here Schank s system is distinctive.
Wilks'sopinion is that the amount of detailed inference that a systemmay perform must be llmited not to go beyond 'commpn sense'..As an example he mentioned Schank's analysis of the action ofeating (performed by moving the hands to the mcuth) and de-1 scribed it as Ugoing too far from the meaning' of eating,whatever that may be, towards generally true informationabout the act which, if always inferred about all acts a?eating, will carry the system unmanageably far.
.
.
.
Thereclearly is a danger of taking inferences to a phenomenologicallevel beyond that of common sense," he concluded.TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 55DEGOUPLING.
The issue is whether the actual parsing oftext fnto an understanding system i s  essential.. Charniak andMinskr believe that this  initial parsing can be decoupled.In Wilks's opinion this is not so, because he belkeves semanticanalysis to be fundamental and because many of the later infe-rences would actually have to be done already, i n  order t o  haveachieved the initial parsing.
Also the problem of systematicambiguity may be met much more e f f i c i e n t l y  w i t h  a system thatdoes not decouple the parsing from r he  inference procedure.AVAILABILITY OF SURFACE STRUCTURE.
In first and secondgeneration systems it is generally accepted that word-sense isa.closely associated w i t h  the surface structure of the sentence,but Schank has made a point of the-nonavailability of thesurface structure, on the grounds that an i d e a l  representationshould be t o t a l l y  independent of the input surface structnreand words.
In connection with this claim of Schank's, Wilkspointed out two things: in many cases the order of the sentencesin .a  text is part of its surface structure, and this informationshould be available in some way.
The other point conceined theform of =epresentation employed Wilks was not sure that astructure of primitlves.
is sufficient for specifying and distin-guishing word senses adequateLy without transferring informationspecifically associated with the input word.APPLICATION.
This concerned the way in which different sys-tems display, in the structures they manipulate, the actualprocedures of application-of those structures to input text orTUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICSdialogue Here the most distinctive.
system is that of Wfnogradwhere the procedural notation, by its nature, tends to makeclear the way in which the structures are applied.
In h i 6  view,as stated in some of his more recent writings, the controlstructure of an understanding program is itself of theoreticalsignificance, for only with a control structure, he believes,can natural language programs of great size and complexityremain perspicuous.FORWARD INFERENCE.
IS it neaessary to make massive for-ward inferences as one goes through a text., as Charniak andSchank do, or can one adopt some laziness hypothesis' aboutunderstanding and generate deeper inferences only qhen thesystem is unable to solve, say, a referential problem by moresuperficial methods?
Charniak's argument is that, unless for-ward inferences are made during the analysis, the s y s t e m  willnot in general be able to solve ambiguity or reference problemsthat arise later.
Wilks had some theoretical difficulties.
tnarguing against this  v i e w ,  and he admitted the d i f f i c u l t y  ofdefining a degree of forward inference that aids the solutionof later semantic problems without going i n t ~  unnecessary depthTHE JUSTIFICATION OF SYSTEMS.
Finally Wilks tried tocontrast.
the different modes of justification implicitlyappealed to in terms of the power of the inferential systememployed, of the provision and"formalizatfon, of a system'sactual performance, and of the linguistic or psychological.plausibility of the proffered system of representation.TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 57In his conclusion Wilks concentrated on those areas wherethe greatest problems within the field of A1 are found.
Thefollowing needs seem to be the most pressing ones the needfor a good memory model (stressed by Schank), the need for anextended procedural theory of texts and for a more sophisticatedtheory of reasons, causes, arid motives for use in a theory ofunderstanding.
Wilks ended his survey by stressing the factthat there is an AI paradigm of language understanding whichembraces first and second generation approaches and goes backto a considerable amount of earlier work in computationallinguisticsINFERENCE AND KNOWLEDGE - Eugene CharniakWhy do we make inferences?
We do when w e  use language andwhen we decode the information conveyed by language, i .
e. in thecase of structural disambiguation as well as in word-sense dis-ambiguation, reference determination, question answering, trans-lation, s m a r i z f n g ,  etc., everywhere a thing not stated expli-citly has to be assumed.
In so doing we are looking Eor a pieceof information, for knowledge beyond the given text or situationCharniak poses five questions about how knowledge is used tomake inferences:1 What c o n c e p t s ,  and in w h a t  combinations, d o  w eneed t o  record our impres s ions  of t h e  w g r l d ?

@hat is the k n o w l e d g e  that we have of the world thatenables us to understand language?
( c o n t e n t )After this program had been put forth, Charniak presented ~ w wpartial answers to the questions the  first orde r  predicatecalculus (FOPC) and the p r o g r a m i n g  language PLANNER.FOPC consists of a+ language for expressing facts and rulesfor deriving new facts from old.
The language consists ofconstants, variables, predicates, functions, logical connectives,and quantifiers.
There are rules for inference.
Charniak thenoutlined RESOLUTION THEOREM PROVING.
It is a system for settingup proofs for dec id ing  which rule of inference to use.
Charniakproceeded to look a t  the five questions he h a d  set forth andexamined what answers.
FOPC provides to them.
He concluded thatFOPC is primarily a theory ot inference mechanism,, but that itsays very little about semantic representation.
As FOPC dogsnot tell how one is to locate the facts which are to be usedto prove the derived result, theoretically we come up againsta huge amount af possibilities when we combine the number ofp o s s i b l e  clauses.with the number of possible resolutions.
Thisis called the "combinatorial explosion'" and is a serious problemin most inference systems, not only far FOPC.Charniak then examined the ~roblern of when we make infe-rences.
There are two obvious occasions when we may make one:TUTORIAL O N  COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS1.
When a question is asked which requires aninference to be made (question time)2.
When the system has been given edough inputi-nformation to  make t h e  inference (read time)Although the inference making r e s t r i c t ed  to question t i m e  wouldseem to be more ,economical since inference .

g .
psy-c h ~ l o g i c a l  experiments on recall of texts).
Furthermore, it isnot possible to do word sense or steuctural disambiguation.withovt making inferenc-es.
Wilks makes a d i s t i n c t i ~ n  between'broblem occasioned" and "nonproblem occasioned" inference.
Atypical example of the latter i s  given i n  -"Janet shook nerpiggy-bank.
There was no sound.. " We assurnel that there isnothing In the piggy-bank although the problem has not yetarisen in the story.
Charniak believes that to do questionanswering on complex stories the system must perform nonproblemoccasioned inference.
ne glves examples rrom children's storieswhere persons lie about things and where the system has to.guesswhy the person is lyingAn alternative t o  FOPC is t o  use the natural p r o p e r t i e sof some programming language to make inferences.
BertramRaphael (1968) did this .ih the system S I R  when he used LISP toconstruce a data base.
Another way is making the programinglanguagesmore suited to the needs of inference making.
Sucha system has t&rl designed bu t  not implemented: PLANNERTUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 60( H e w i ' t t  1969)  I n  this system we are able to pick up anassertion by knowing parts of it If no appropriate assertioncan be made, we can t r y  to have theorems ( i .

PLANNER has the a b i l i t y  t o  choosewhich theorems t o  use on the basis of the i r  patterns.
This isc a l l e d  PATTERN DIRECTED INVOCATION.
Furthermore, the systemcan back up to see if any earlier choices night be changed.This feature is somewhat controversial, since it might encouragethe construcLi0n of programs which depend on b l i n d  search.PLANNER'S advantage over FOPC is that it offers several built-inorganizational features, tne primary one being pattern directedinvocation.
A disadvantage about it as t heory  of knowledge andinference is thar: it is too vague Charniak (197.2-) illustratesthe pros and cons of PLANNER using children's s tor ies .
Givena piece of simple narration, the system should be able t oanswer reasonable quegtions about it.
Charniak Stresses theneed for looking ahead in t h g  story to make inferences  Forthis he uses.
an anteceden~ theorem or a "demon".
The routineswhich are  available to set up demons he calls ensE ROUTINES.In addition- he makes u s e  BOOKKEEPING f o r  updat ing the as-s e r t i ons  and of Consequent theorems pealled FACTFI-NDERS: t h ebasic idea  behind faetfinders is that they are used to e s t a b l i s hfacts w h i e h - a r e ' n o t  too important  so that w e  do not want toTUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL .SEMANTICSnssert t h e w  and store them in the data base..
The main advan-tage of this system is that it provides a good theory ofsrganization.
It states in particular that "given a particularassertion.
the way we find those facts which we should use tonake inferences from the assertion is to 'look in two places-.first the base routine for assertions of that form, & secondfor any demons.which happen to have been activated which arelooking for assertions of that ford" '  Charniak concluded hislectures by examining the recent works of three scholars:1.
McDermott ' s system TOPLE (1.974) is rnalnly concernedwith the problem of 'beliefs, describing a simple world con-sisting of a monkey and an experimenter in a single room.
Theprogram listens to a present-tense account of what is happeningin the zoom; it tries to understand why things happen and whatcan be sxpected to happen as the story poas on.
It tells us a tt.he end of every sentence what new assertions it has assumedas a rbesult of hearing.
TOPLE's restrictions are the following:it does not answer questibns, it does not handle actual naturallanguage but rather a formal-looking input language.
On theotrrer hand, it tries to visualize concretely a situation.
Itis based on a "multiple wo.rld structure"2.
Rieger (1974) is the first to have attempted to useSchank's conceptual dependency theory within a theory af infe-rence and knowledge.
Rieger!~ program has as its main purposetc make reasonable inferences from the input it is given.
TheTUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 62input i s  expressed i n  a suitable formalism, i.e.
conceptual de-pendency representation.
It is also designed to understandstories, engage in dialogues, figure out references and word-sense ambiguity, answer questions about the way the worldnormally is3.
Minsky ' s (1974) frames are reinterpreted by Charniakas "a collect-ion o r  questions to be asked about a hypotheticalsituation.
Frames specify issues to be raised and methods tobe used in dealing with t h e m .
I tCharniak also gave a double lecturn on SYNTAX I N  LINGUISTICS.This was an introduction t o  generative g r a m m a r  for those who hadnot had a. formal course in linguistics.MEMORY MODELS - Greg W -  Scraqg.After introducing SEMANTIC NETS, Scragg discussed t h e i rmost important properties and compared several systems indlud-ing some with partial semantic nets, some with partiallyquantitied semantic nets, some with fully quantified semanttcnets, and some with executable semantic nets.He compared semantic net representations and predicatecalculus tepresentations.Attempts to construct proofs in the predicate calculus willshow the difficulty CXE sklecting the relevant infqrrnation formaking a par t i cu la r  deduction f r o m  a specif-ic fact.
The tech-niques currently employed in theborem proving programs are evenless efficient,a.t selecting the most relevant material.TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICSIn comparison 3f predicate calculu-s and semantic nets,most problems center around the question of quantification.How does one quantify relations in a semantic net?
Scraggmentions three different approaches.1.
There are six possible quan~~ficatio~s fur a two-placepredicate Pxyvxv yPxy , ZxVyPxy , 3yVxPxy, Vz3yPxy, *VyIIxPxy, 3?$3yPxyIn Scragg (1973) the claim is made that #the first three formsare so rare in everyaay (nonscientif?~) s-ituations that theymay be ignored.
The rematning ones may be distinguished witha type-token flag.2.
palme (1973) tries to represent quantification byintroducing a third quantifier, ITS (meanins spme-thing like thepossessive pronoun "its").
With three quantifiers, he now camdefine six separate  relations for each pwvious relation:Quantifying with FOR-ALL or EXISTS on the Left and FOR-ALL.,EXISTS, or ITS on the r-ight of the old relation.
One disadvan-t age  of t h i s  i s  that he potentially has six times as manyrelations to work with and has to keep erack of the relationshipsbetween each of the six versions of the same-relation.3.
Schubert- (1975) treats quantifiers in a different way.He first puts the predicate calculus representation of thestatement into SKOLEM FORM (a form which has no existentialquantifiers and with all- universal quantlfiers outside 05 thebody of t h e  express-ion), Any node that is existentiallyTUTORItAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 64quantified but dependent an a universally quantified node isconnected to that governing node.
An event is asserred if andonly if there is no arrow pointing to that node in the diagram.The semantic net structures here tend to become very complex.~---~~"--""--------"----"""""i.iiiiii"iiiiiiiii" 1 .., a"".

.-----It is not clear that any of the three approaches givereally practical (or int~~tively satisfying) results.What we need at present is a theory of more conplex actions.For example, how do we link the descriptions of the varioussubsteps of the pro.cess of cake making into a single desciiptionof the overall action of making a cake?There arb those who claim that a l l  knowledge is stored inthe form of procedures and there are those who clraim that it isstored as a collection of facts.Scragg ( 1 9 7 4 ;  see also Nonuan 1973 and Norman et a1 1975)takes an intermediate approach by making use of ambiguous (dataor procedure) representat-ions to store information about actions.The system knows how to simulate various human actions-such astoasting bread, making spaghetti sr cleaning up the kitchen.The information a b ~ u t  how to perform these siinulatibns is:stored as procedures.
However, these procedures can be usedas data by other parts o f  the system to answer such questicms.as "'HOW do you make a ham and cheese sandwtich?

B u t  this s l t b -t i o n  1s not  typical.One of t h e  basic usages of formulae conSist's of namingby formula A s o m e  individual object a belonging tos o m e  class b of objects such t h a t  there  exists  s o m e  nounblock C l ( A )  that names b.For example, i'n the expression 'set R' the formula*R' names some individual s e t  belonging to the class of%etsN-.
N o u n  block @seta (consisting in this case- of asingle -noun) names this class.So herec ~ ( R )  = *sete.Consider some diff icultAes arising in translationbecause of the  absence in a source sentence of the Cl(f)f o r  a formula E.L e t  US try to translate from, Engllcsh-to 'Russian thesentencen\yn -- W c i r s t  find an x m e n t  r of R v .

We can ascribe this meaning to t he  formula* R n  [.governed by the prep~s i t iorr  'of'):---*We first f ind  element r R + genitive'.
(Syntactical links are also shown).At ^this point, the process of translation is suspendeabecause of the fact  t h a t  in Russian two non-coordinateformulae cannot depend on the s a m e  now.Similar examples are provicted by other languages:.German : In jeder Umgebung V von o X* .A human interpreter does not usually hesitate toproperly translate such expressions only because he under-stmnds their meaning from a general background or vastcontext.
We can point out some characteristic construe--t ions  in mathematical t e x t s  that are sufficient as con-t e x t s  in such cases.
Consider, f o r  example, such a con-text.(i.e.

( 5 )The "direct* translation of ( 5 )  to Russian:'Qpredeltm j i k putjorn j = m + n; k = m - n bis not smooth enough; the translation:'Opredelim J i k s pomosh ju so~tn~shenij3 = m  + n; k -= m - n*,(*We ikefine j and k by correspondences j = m + n;k = m - n") is much better.~ l ( f ]  can be sometimes defined f r o m  the very formulaf.

'Tous l e s  ensembles Li d indices lnferieursa un nombre donne IS@ ( c ~ ( L ~ )  is underlined).In this case we can reduce C1(L ) to only one word i*ensembles*.
But in rare cases such reduction will pro-duce absolutely inadequate translations,Example tIn the expression'Pour les fonctlons x ( t )  de Lgw i t h  a context,La partie cornwe L de tous l es  ensembles Li '(Cl(L) is underlined),we cannot reduce C 1 ( , L )  to only one w o r d  upartlee, whichI s  i ts  syntactical governor,'St is very difficult to formulate a general Pule tadiscriminate between cases of typee (6) and (7 ) .The expression.

The computability of such synonyms can, of course,be questioned,Now we shall consider s o m e  p r o D l e m s  a r i s i ng  in trans-lation of Russian mathematical texts into European andother  languages.The constructionin Russian has t w o  syntactical meanings,(a) appositive:,(b) genitive:'The cause of thls difficulty is the  omission ofCl(f) in r;ne surfaoe syntactical structure of s o m eRussian sentences:lpodmnozhestvo mnozhestva Bv- 'podrnozhestvo B p"SubseT (of 1 s e t  B" "Subset (of) B n .In such cases m e  qenitive link is rare ( 5 %  ofnall occurrences of constructions of type N f, i .
e mseveral-dozen occurrences in a mathematical article).The task of automatic cho1c.e here is very d i f f i c u l t .
Itwas solved o n l y  partially.
We can c h ~ o s e  from the t e x tof an article about 70% of all occurrences of t h e  appo-s i t i v e  links and a l so  sowe occurrences of geni't-ivelinks, The rest of occurrences remain ambiguous.The proposed procedures w e r e  checked in exhaustingmanual experiments, hue their aaaptation f o r  computer isquite  feasible.C h o i c e  of appositive l i n k sLet us consider the following empirically statedax h o m s  val id :( A  ) In t he  same Russian t e x t  every t w o  different 1occurrences o f  t.he same expsre,ssion of type.- N f are or both appositive or bothSo, if we have s-ucceeded in clarifying the meaning of alink in one occurreme of a construction, we can ascribethis meaning to every occurrence of t h e  same construction.
( A ~ )  In a.construction of the typewhere fl and f2 are two syntactt;cally co-_T~rdinate formulae, the t w o  l inks  are  bothappositive or both qenitive.For example, havirlg a construction( " s e t s  A and BH or '@se ts  of and 13")and knowing that in'mnozhesf va Amt h e  link is appositiye, we can consider t h e  link in*mnozhestva Beto also be appositive (1.e.
"sets A and B").
( A  ) Let us call constructions of the type 3f jest' N*and*oboznachim N cherez f *( I * ~ e t  us desiqnate N by f")introductory construotions.
Every introductory construc-tion ascr-ibes the meanizg to the formula which It in t ro-duces.nIn every construc,ti.on N f, for which m. lntro-ductory construct ion exists i n  the same t e x t .
the( A  ) Sometimes the meaning is ascribed to a formu- 4la without any introductory con.struction.The l i n k  in an occurrence r of a constructiono f t  e N  f L f  t h e  expressionf has not occurred in the t e x t  berore.
r,.In this case the formu3.a f must also not occur beforer as any coherent part (subformula) of some other formulaF,  Because t -Re  meaning can be ascribed to a formula f byits place In F tsee above).
Sut t o  use t h e  distinctionbetween a coherent and a non-coherent part  of a formula(Cf.
'a + b' in '(a + b)/d8 and in 'ca +bd9), we needa calculus of' all mathematical symbolic notations, of whichonly small portions exist (Cf.
arithmetic expresssionS 0fprograhming languages ) .
Becaus-e of this Ah was formu1.a-ted in the above form).
(A ) Sometimes there  occur in mathematical t e x t s  5expressions where verbal and symbolic parts are interwovenso that irl syntactic analysis a s-ymbolic insertion appearsno t  as a single unit but as a complex construction havingi t s  own struct'ure.
Some p a r t s  of tr formula can have linksof their o m  wish t h e  external verbal parts of the sen-tence.Examples :( tmFunotion L H ( I 1 ) "  ).He re * is the predicate of .the sentence, 'Funs-tidn9 is iks subject and C H ( R ) *  - an indi~ect object,The sentence Can be read as' 'F.unction L b e l o n ~ s  toH ( E I ) ' *( "For every 1 6 B".. .
)Here is anmattribute *of 1 and can be read as'belonging to'.3.
'funktsija L E  H(R) opredeljajetsjam..,.
"Function LO H(R) is defined by*... )Here @ H ( R )  @ is an attribute of *Function9, and @t9 isan apposition modif-ying the same word.
B u t  the wholestring L E H(R) can a l s o  be corlsidered an appositionmodifying t h e  w o r d  'functioh' .
So, w e  can formulate a ru le :m If the link in some construction of t h e  type N -A f I sapposiCt;'ve, then the link of t h e  same N w i t h  the formula-f R-- f * .

is a (coherent) p a r t  of theformula f R f' Ls a l s o  appositive.The  inverse also holds t r u e .Using the axioms A1 to A5 c y c l i c l y  , we receivet h e  70% mentioned above.Example :Let us assume that the fo l lowing Russi.an expresslionsbelong to the  same mathematical tex t  (and the p r e l i m i -nary syntactical analysis has already been done):(I) @Oboenachim e tu  tsepochku cherea A'("Let us designate ths iS  s t r ing by A" ) ;( 2 )  'tsepochki A i B = D @("strings.

)U s i n g  axioms A 3 9  A=, A 2 9  kg* A19 Az and A1 wecan ascribe the meaning "appositive" to the link in (4) .Assuming t h a t  In a t e x t  expressions (2), 3 and(4 )  are present, and thar; the occurrence of @ in ( 4 )  1sthe f1rs.t; occurrence of this formula, w e  Can ascri3e to t h e1 ink'tsepachkl A'in ( 2 )  the meaning "appositive" with the a i d  of axioms A4,A1 A ,  A5 and A2 .So, we receive f o r  expressio2s ( 3 )  to ( 4 )  translations:"strings - A  and B = DM; *stxings B and FH ; *string F*It is worthwhile to mention t h a t  the same formulamay occur in a t e x t  being linked appositively to severald%ffe,rent n o m s ,  for example,and 'mno~oobrazi je it (l'manlfold a R* ) .-f Different N in expressions of t h e  type N(with the s a m e  f) can r'ef'er to each other as genus andspecies or can name obdects f o r  which the  f a c t  of theiridentlty has been proven in the t e x t .
Using tho  axiom A4we can (very r a r e l y )  make an error.
An error can occur ina case where the f ~ r m u l a  has the meaning specified onceand f o r  all independently from t he  text .
So, wit,haut anyprevious definition of the meaning in an introductory con-struction or in a construction w f t n  tne apposftive link, aformula can at once be linked ~ e n i t 1 v e l .

'&',@ $ '  in common Enqlish) and n o t  a freely chosen notation.Such a word must be storea in the dictionary (wlth the8 4epecific m e a n i n g  ascribed to it).
For example, 'dx/dyW is'derivativeq.Using Cl (f ) in every case of occurrence of e-yeryformula, authors  of mathematical cexts  w o u l d  nake the aboveprocedures unnecessary.
