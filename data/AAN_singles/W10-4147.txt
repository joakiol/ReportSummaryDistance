Technical Report of the CCID System for the 2th Evaluation onChinese ParsingGuangfan SunChina Center for Information Industry Development, Beijing, 100044morgan2001_sun@163.comAbstractThis paper gives an overview of ChinaCenter for Information Industry Devel-opment(CCID) participating in the 2thEvaluation on Chinese parsing.
CCIDhas taken part in the subtask of theanalysis of complete sentences.
The sys-tem participating in the above Evaluationis a rule-based Chinese parser, and itsbasic information is described in the pa-per, and its experimental situation for theEvaluation has been analyzed.1 IntroductionParsing is one of key issues in natural languageprocessing, and its main task is to automaticallyidentify the syntactic structure of sentences (syn-tactic units and their syntactic relations betweenunits).
The study of parsing is of critical impor-tance for machine translation, natural languageunderstanding, information extraction and auto-matic summarization of natural language proc-essing systems.
Syntactic analysis methods in-clude methods of use of corpus annotation in-formation in syntactic analysis and the rule-based methods such as: Shift-Reduce Parsingand Chart Parsing technology to study the Chi-nese syntactic structure[1].
In this paper, theChinese parser which China Electronic Informa-tion Industry Development (CCID) uses to par-ticipate in the 2th Evaluation on Chinese Parsingis described.2 SystemThe Chinese parser which CCID uses toparticipate in the 2th Evaluation on ChineseParsing serves as a component of a practicalChinese-English machine translation system,and uses rule-based method, and uses statisticalapproach for unknown word recognition.
TheChinese parser includes the following threemodules: 1) Chinese word segmenting, 2)Chinese POS tagging, 3) Chinese parsing.
Theform of rules in the Chinese parser is productionrule.
The rules include general rules and specificrules.
The general rules are indexed by POS orphrase types, and specific rules are indexed byChinese word or Chinese phrase.
There aremulti-passes during Chinese parsing, and theresult of the parsing of a Chinese sentence is aChinese syntactic tree.
The CCID?s Chineseparser includes 1,930,000 entries in the basicdictionaries and 6,000 rules in knowledge base.Parts of speech and syntactic elements of theoutput of the CCID?s Chinese parser are markedby its own set of markup symbols, and thesemarkup symbols are mapped to parts of speechtags and syntactic component tags defined byCIPS-ParsEval-2009 by a conversion function.The CCID?s tag set is mainly same as the set ofCIPS-ParsEval-2009 except the used tagcharacters.
For example, in the CCID?s tag set,the tag of noun phrase is NP, and the tag of verbphrase is VP, and the tag of preposition phrase isIP; for the tags in CIPS-ParsEval-2009, the tagof noun phrase is np, and the tag of verb phraseis vp, and the tag of preposition phrase is pp.3 ExperimentCCID participated in the 2th Evaluation on Chi-nese Parsing, and timely submitted parsing out-put of test sentences of the syntactic analysis.The Test Group returned to a very unfortunatemessage: "find that the results presented in theoriginal segmentation of data are automaticallymerged, so can not give the appropriate evalua-tion of data.

?and some other entries have already existedas separate entries in the basic dictionaries of theCCID?s Chinese parser.
In parsing, these entriesact as separate entries and the results also showup as separate entries.
This occurs because of thelarger basic dictionary(1.93 million entries), andthese entries have the corresponding Englishtranslations on the expression.
For a practicalChinese parser, a large number of phrases thatalready exist in the basic vocabularies can re-duce the burden of parsing, and are useful forimproving the success rate of Chinese syntacticanalysis.
But this adds extra burden to evaluationprograms.
When participating in the next Chi-nese parsing evaluation, some phrases that haveexisted in the basic dictionaries of Chineseparser will be divided to further analyze theirinternal syntactic structures to facilitate theevaluation process.After receiving the notice that a re-evaluationcan be done by the Evaluation Group to helpCCID to evaluate the effectiveness of the modi-fication of the parsing model, the following stepsare carried out for the convenience of the evalua-tion programs:1) Compare all words in the test task withCCID?s Chinese parser, and find out theinformation for the words from CCID?sChinese parser, and delete all otherwords from the Chinese parser to avoidthe situation that some Chinese wordsare combined when parsing.2) Modify parsing rules that contain opera-tions of deleting words to avoid the de-letion of Chinese words in the parsingresults.3) Re-parse Chinese sentences in the testtask.4) Submit the result of the parsing to theEvaluation Group to evaluate.The re-evaluation result is as the following:Performance Report for Task 2-2pos accuracy:  72.98% (19253/26381)average of F1 of dj_sum and fj: 26.87 (%)Label #Auto #Gold #Correctdj  3826 2290 1156vp  5954 7397 3090ap  532  432 267np  5778  5199 3478sp  0  433 0tp  0  381 0mp 443  614 341mbar 47  45 29dp  782  65 42pp  1263      1191 546bp  0  1 0total 18625 18048 8949Label Precision  Recall   F1dj   30.21    50.48     37.80vp   51.90    41.77     46.29ap   50.19    61.81     55.39np   60.19    66.90     63.37sp   0.00    0.00     0.00tp   0.00    0.00     0.00mp  76.98    55.54     64.52mbar  61.70    64.44     63.04dp   5.37    64.62     9.92pp   43.23    45.84     44.50bp   0.00    0.00     0.00total 48.05    49.58     48.80Label #Auto #Gold #Correctfj  450 1251 42Label Precision  Recall      F1fj  9.33(%)    3.36(%)   4.94(%)4 DiscussionChinese parsing is an important basic researchfor Chinese information processing research, andgets the attention of many researchers.
Currentresearch focuses on the research on syntacticknowledge acquisition based on the corpus, andits goal is to use statistical methods from a goodtree bank annotation to learn the parsing neededknowledge, and the trained parser also promotesthe work of automatic/semi-automatic annota-tion to corpus.
Statistical methods have an ad-vantage for fine-grained knowledge of the lan-guage than the rule method, and can automati-cally learn knowledge from the annotated corpus,and is attractive and worthy of research.Meanwhile, many Chinese parsers that havethe background for the practical application usethe rule-based approach, and, in addition to theaccumulation of knowledge in the process ofmanual knowledge acquisition, also use statisti-cal methods to help get the phrases from thecorpus, and also include the translation equiva-lents acquired automatically for machine transla-tion.
An important direction of development forthese systems is to find ways to learn a lot ofphrase knowledge from the corpus, which cangreatly reduce the difficulties encountered in theambiguity resolution to improve the accuracy ofsyntactic analysis.
For Chinese-English machinetranslation system, the difficulty will be signifi-cantly lower after adding a large number ofphrases and their translation to the system, andas a result, some syntactic structure ambiguitiesare eliminated, and many phrases are translatedas a whole and the readability of the translationalso are improved.An important development trend of naturallanguage processing is that corpus is consideredas processing objects and sources of knowledgeacquisition.
Rule approach has proven to be dif-ficult to the task of processing large-scale realcorpus, so the researchers turn to the help of sta-tistical methods, and many experiments provethat statistical methods indeed have made greatprogress.
But the statistical method has its inher-ent shortcomings, and statistical methods alonecan hardly reach expectations of the perfect goalof natural language processing.
Thus, Many re-searchers begin to explore ways of combinationof statistical methods and rules, and have madesome progress, but there is still a long way to gofrom the ultimate goal of natural language proc-essing (computer can fully understand the natureof human language).
The current trend of inte-gration of empiricism and rationalism in naturallanguage processing is a significant phenomenon,and its development will produce a lot of valu-able results, and natural language processingresearch and applications will benefit from it.The CCID?s future research will focus onmethods of automatically extracting knowledgeof Chinese phrases and their translations.
Thesemethods will be mainly statistical methods,combining with some of the rules means to fa-cilitate access to single-language knowledge andimprove the correct translation rate.
Progress ofthe research in this regard will be helpful for ourpractical machine translation system to improvethe quality of translation.
At the same time, ithas a direct role in improving the quality of Chi-nese parser.The paper is funded by National Natural Sci-ence Foundation of China, and the project num-ber is: 60872118.ReferencesFeng Zhiwei.
