With this object,we give two contrasting examples of de-scriptions of two Aboriginal languages fi-nite verb forms morphology: ArgentineanQuechua (quichua santiaguen?o) and Toba.The description of the morphology of thefinite verb forms of Argentinean quechua,uses finite automata and finite transducers.In this case the construction is straight-forward using two level morphology andthen, describes in a very natural way theArgentinean Quechua morphology usinga regular language.
On the contrary, theToba verbs morphology, with a system thatsimultaneously uses prefixes and suffixes,has not a natural description as regular lan-guage.
Toba has a complex system ofcausative suffixes, whose successive ap-plications determinate the use of prefixesbelonging different person marking pre-fix sets.
We adopt the solution of Crei-der et al (1995) to naturally deal with thisand other similar morphological processeswhich involve interactions between pre-fixes and suffixes and then we describe thetoba morphology using linear context-freelanguages.1.1 IntroductionIt has been proved (Johnson, 1972; Kaplan andKay, 1994) that regular models have an expre-1This work is part of the undergraduate thesis Finitestate morphology: The Koskenniemi?s two level morphologymodel and its application to describing the morphosyntaxisof two native Argentinean languagessive power equal to the noncyclic componentsof generative grammmars representing the mor-phophonology of natural languages.
However,these works make no considerations about whatclass of formal languages is the natural for de-scribing the morphology of one particular lan-guage.
On the other hand, the criteria of classi-fication of Amerindian languages, do not involvecomplexity criteria.
In order to establish crite-ria that take into account the complexity of thedescription we present two contrasting examplesin two Argentinean native languages: toba andquichua santiaguen?o.
While the quichua has a nat-ural representation in terms of a regular languageusing two level morphology, we will show that theToba morphology has a more natural representa-tion in terms of linear context-free languages.2 Quichua Santiaguen?oThe quichua santiaguen?o is a language of theQuechua language family.
It is spoken in the San-tiago del Estero state, Argentina.
Typologicallyis an agglutinative language and its structure is al-most exclusively based on the use of suffixes and isextremely regular.
The morphology takes a domi-nant part in this language with a rich set of valida-tion suffixes.
The quichua santiaguen?o has a muchsimpler phonologic system that other languages ofthis family: for example it has no series of aspi-rated or glottalized stops.Since the description of the verbal morphologyis rich enough for our aim to expose the regular na-ture of quichua santiaguen?o morphology, we haverestricted our study to the morphology of finiteverbs forms.
We use the two level morphologyparadigm to express with finite regular transduc-ers the rules that clearly illustrate how naturallythis language phonology is regular.
The construc-tion uses the descriptive works of Alderetes (2001)and Nardi (Albarrac?

The subsetsabbreviations are: V (vowel), Vlng (underlyingvowel).Valt (high vowel),VMed (median vowel),Vbaj (bass vowel) , Ftr (trasparent to medializa-tion phonema), Cpos (posterior consonant).ALPHABETa e i o u p t ch k q s sh ll mn l r w y b d g gg f h x r rrA E I O U W N Q Y + ?NULL 0ANY @BOUNDARY #SUBSET C p t ch k q s sh ll mn l r w y b d f hx r rr h QSUBSET V i e a o u A E I O USUBSET Vlng I E A O USUBSET Valt u i U ISUBSET VMed e o E OSUBSET Vbaj a ASUBSET Ftr n y r Y NSUBSET Cpos gg q QWith the aim of showing the simplicity of thephonologic rules we transcribe the two-level ruleswe have implemeted with the transducers in thethesis.

This description of the morphophonologywas implemented using PC-KIMMO (Antworth,1990)3 The Toba morphologyThe Toba language belongs, with the languagespilaga, mocovi and kaduveo, to the guaycurulanguage family (Messineo, 2003; Klein, 1978).The toba is spoken in the Gran Chaco region(which is comprised between Argentina, Boliviaand Paraguay) and in some reduced settlementsnear Buenos Aires, Argentina.
From the point ofview of the morphologic typology it presents char-acteristics of a polysynthetic agglutinative lan-guage.
In this language the verb is the morpho-logically more complex wordclass.
The grammat-ical category of person is prefixed to the verbaltheme.
There are suffixes to indicate plurals andother grammatical categories as aspect, location-direction, reflexive and reciprocal and desidera-tive mode.
The verb has no mark of time.
As anexample of a typical verb we can considerate thesanadatema:Example 1 .s- anat(a) -d -em -a1Act- advice 2 dat ben?
I advice you?2One of the characteristics of the toba verb mor-phology is a system of markation active-inactiveon the verbal prefixes (Messineo, 2003; Klein,1978).
There are in this language two sets or ver-bal prefixes that mark action:1.
Class I (In):codifies inactive participants, ob-jects of transitive verbs and pacients of in-transitive verbs.
.2.
Class II(Act): codifies active participants,subjects of transitive and intransitive verbs.2abrev: Act:active, ben:benefactive, dat:dative,inst: intru-mental,Med: Median voice, pos: Posessor, refl: reflexive110q0q1q2q3q4q5q6q7q8q9q10q11q15q16q17q18q20q21Caus?ModI?Tr3?|Refl?Tr2?Tr1?Actor?PlO2FutFutFutO2ModII?ModIIO?ModII?Pas?Pas?Pas?Ag23Ag13Ag123CondGenTopFigure1:Schemaoftheverbalmorphologyofthequichuasantiaguen?o.Thesupraindices?indicatepossiblenulltransitions.Abrev.

.The toba has a great quantity of morphologicalprocesses that involve interactions between suf-fixes and prefixes.
In the next example the suffix-ation of the reflexive (?l?at) forces the use of theactive person with prefixes of the voice mediumclass because the agent is affected by the action.Example 2 .
(a) y- alawat3Activa -kill?
He kills?
(b) n- alawat -l?at3Med- kill -refl?
He kills himself?The agglutination of this suffix occurs in thelast suffix box (after locatives, directional andother derivational suffixes).
Then, if we modelthis process using finite automata we will addmany items to the lexicon (Sproat, 1992).
Thederivation of names from verbs is very productive.There are many nominalizer suffixes.
The result-ing names use obligatory possessing person nom-inal prefixes.Example 3 .l- edaGan -at3pos write instr?his pencil?The toba language also presents a complex sys-tem of causative suffixes that act as switching thetransitivity of the verb.
Transitivity is specially ap-preciable in the switching of the 3rd person prefixmark.
In section 3.2 we will use this process toshow how linear context free grammars are a betterthan regular grammars for modeling agglutinationin this language, but first we will present the for-mer class of languages and its acceptor automata.3.1 Linear context free languages andtwo-taped nondeterministic finite-stateautomataA linear context-free language is a language gen-erated by a grammar context-free grammars G inwhich every production has one of the three forms(Creider et al, 1995):1.
A ?
a, with a terminal symbol2.
A ?
aB, with B a non terminal symbol anda a terminal symbol.3.
A ?
Ba, with B a non terminal symbol anda a terminal symbol.Linear context-free grammars have been stud-ied by Rosenberg (1967) who showed that thereis an equivalence between them and two-tapednondeterministic finite-state automata.
Informally,a two-head nondeterministic finite-state automatacould be thought as a generalization of a usualnondeterministic finite-state automata which hastwo read heads that independently reads in two dif-ferent tapes, and at each transition only one tapemoves.
When both tapes have been processed, ifthe automata is at a final state, the parsing is suc-cessful.
In the ambit that we are studying we canthink that if a word is a string of prefixes, a stemand suffixes, one automata head will read will theprefixes and the other the suffixes.
Taking intoaccount that linear grammars are in Rosenberg?sterms: ?
The lowest class of nonregular context-free grammars?, Creider et al (1995) have takenthis formal language class as the optimal to modelmorphological processes that involve interactionbetween prefixes and suffixes.3.2 Analysis of the third person verbalparadigmIn this section we model the morphology of thethird person of transitive verbs using two-taped fi-nite nondeterministics automata.
The modeling ofthis person is enough to show this description ad-vantages with respect to others in terms of regularlanguages.
The transitivity of the verb plays an im-portant role in the selection of the person markerClass.
The person markers are (Messineo, 2003):1. i-/y- for transitive verbs y and some intra-sitive subjects (Pr AcT).2. d(Vowel) for verbs typically intransitives (PrActI).3. n: subjets of medium voice (Pr ActM).The successive application of the causativeseems to act here, as was interpreted by Buckwal-ter (2001), like making the switch in the originalverb transitivity as is shown en Example 4 in thenext page.112Example 4 .IV de- que?e he eatsTV i- qui?
-aGan he eats(something)IV de- qui?
-aGanataGan he feedsTV i- qui?
-aGanataGanaGan he feeds(a person)IV de qui?
-aGanaGanataGan he command to feedIf we want to model this morphological processusing finite automata again we must enlarge thelexicon size.
The resulting grammar, althoughtcapable of modeling the morphology of the toba,would not work effectively.
The effectivenessof a grammar is a measure of their productivity(Heintz, 1991).
Taking into account the productiv-ity of causative and reflexive verbal derivation wewill prefer a description in terms of a context-freelinear grammar with high effectivity than anotherusing regular languages with low effectivity.To model the behavior of causative agglutina-tion and the interaction with person prefixes us-ing the two-head automata, we define two pathsdetermined by the parity of the causative suffixeswich have been agglutinated to the verb.
We havealso to take into consideration the optative pos-terior aglutination of reflexive and reciprocal suf-fixes wich forces the use of medium voice personprefix.
From the third person is also formed thethird person indefinite actor from a prefix, qa -,which is at left and adjacent to the usual mark ofthe third person and after the mark of negation sa-.
Therefore, their agglutination is reserved to thelast transitions.
The resulting two-typed automatashowed in Figure 2 also takes into account the rel-ative order of the boxes and so the mutual restric-tions between them (Klein, 1978).4 Future ResearchIt is interesting to note that phonological rules intoba can be naturally expressed by regular FiniteTransducers.
There are, however, many SouthAmerican native languages that presents morpho-logical processes analogous to the Toba and somecan present phonological processes that will havea more natural expression using Linear FiniteTransducers.
For example the Guarani languagepresents nasal harmony which expands from theroot to both suffixes and prefixes (Krivoshein,1994).
This kind of characterization can havesome value in language classification and the mod-eling of the great diversity of South American lan-guages morphology can allow to obtain a formalconcept of natural description of a language..ReferencesLelia Albarrac?
