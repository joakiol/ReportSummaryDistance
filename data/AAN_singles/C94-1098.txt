A PARSER COPING WITH SELF-REPAIRED JAPANESEUTTERANCES AND LARGE CORPUS-BASED EVALUATIONYuji Sagawa Noboru Ohnishi Noboru SugieDept.
of Information Engineering, Nagoya University, JapanINTRODUCTIONSelf-repair(Levelt 1988) is a repair of ut-terance by speaker him/herself.
A trumanspeaker makes self-repairs very frequently inspontaneous peedt.
(Blackmer and Mit-ton 1991) reported that self-repairs are madeonce every 4.8 seconds in dialogues takenfi'om radio talk shows.Self-repair is one ldnd of "permissible ill-formedness", that is a human listener canfeel ill-formedness in it hut he/she is able torecognize its intended meaning.
Thus yourpartner does not need to interrupt dialogue.Itow do you feel if your partner interruptsdialogue very 5 seconds to ask "What do youmean?"
or so?
You will give up dialogue orchoose means of writing.
Speaking withoutself-repair is the most difficult modality ofnatural anguage communication.The goal of our work is to make a di-alogue system coping with self-repaired ut-terances.
In this paper we propose aparser called SERUP(SElf-Repaired Utter-ance Parser), which plays a major part in un-derstanding a self-repaired utterance.
Thatis, because our approach is to translate aself-repaired utterance (Ex.1) into a well-formed version that does not contain self-repair (Ex.2) and parse the well-formed one,we do not need to change the subsequent pro-cesses.\[Ex.1\] And fi'om green left to pink,er, from blue left to pink (from(Levelt 1988))\[Ex.2\] And fi'om blue left to pinkSERUP uses some linguistic clues to trans-late utterances, those include a repetition, anunknown word and/or an isolated word.
Wedescribe how SERUP uses these clues.To evaluate SERUP, we analyze a largecorpus that contains spontaneous dialoguesover telephone.
From the result, we estimatethat SI';RUP works well with 88.1% of 1,082self-repairs in the corpus.I~ELATED WORKS(Hindle 1983) and (Langer 1990) proposedparsers coping with self-repaired utterances.But they assumed that an interruption pointhas already been detected.
Hindle thoughtprosodic cues carl be used in detection, butit is not clear if they can always succeed.Langer thought editing expressions can beused, but they are not always used in self-repair.Recently, (Shriberg, Bear, and l)owdlng1992) proposed a pattern matching methodand used it ill GEMINI system(Dowdinget al 1993).
Tills is similar to our method,but the corpus(MADCOW 1992) used is lessspontarleous than ours.
(Subjects pressed abutton to begin speaking to the system)(Nakatani and Hirschberg 1993) proposeda speech-first method in which prosodic uesare used mainly.
We also think prosodic uesare important.
But wc think people use lin-guistic cues mainly because they can under-stand self-repaired utterances in transcripts.All these works are done on English.
(Langer also treats Germany) Because thereare many syntactic differences (e.g., leftl)ranching v.s.
right branching), it is not593clear if their approach is applicableJapanese.OUTL INE  OF SEt ,UPtoFig.1 shows the outline of SERUP.Normal Parser is a parser that parses well-formed utterances.
When Normal Parserfails to parse an utterance, the utterance ispassed to SR-reconstructor that detects aself-repair in it and translates it into well-formed version.
The translated utterance isreturned to Normal Parser and parsed again.Because an utterance can contain two ormore self-repairs, translation is repeated un-til Normal Parser succeeds in parsing ortranslation fails.
In the latter case, the utter-ance has another ill-formedness or self-repairthat the SR-reconstructor cannot cope with.There are two main problems in trans-lation.
One is to det, errnine an interrup-tion point, and the other is to determine areparandum.
If these two problems can besolved, then the process of translation is car-ried out as follows.1.
Remove editing expressions uch as er,rio, I mean.2.
Supersede the reparandum with repairpart.For more detail of SERUP, see (Sagawa,Ohnishi, and Sugie 1993).CLUES TO TRANSLAT IONIn this dlapter, we will describe a classifi-cation of self-repaired utterances.

Cate-gories printed in italics have no clue, i.e.,SERUP fails to parse utterances in those cat-egories.with repetit ionA self-repair is mostly made in a way to re-pair a word or a phrase just before an inter-ruption(Levelt 1988).
So words or phrasesaround an interruption are in the same cate-gory.
For example, in \[Ex.l\] speaker epairs aprepositional phrase "from green left to pink"to "from blue left to pink", It is rare thathe/she just repairs a noun "green" to "blue".In such self-repairs, a repetition of a wordor a phrase often exists.
In self-repairs whichare intended to correct an error (such as\[Ex.1\]), words or phrases around the errormay be repeated..In \[gx.1\], "from" and "left to pink" are re-peated.
In sell-repairs which are intended toadd some information to the item just men-tioned, the item may be repeated as in \[Ex.a\].\[Ex.3\] \[ want a fight, one way flight(from (Shrlberg, Bear, and l)owd-ing 1992))ILl this example a word "flight" is repeated.A repetition is made with the same con-stituent or an item in tile same category, suchas "orange" with "apl)le".There are four possible structures aroundan int, errupl, ion of a self-repa.ir with a repet;i-tion.

2: Possible structures around interrup-tion594A is a case of a simple repetition.
B, Cand l) are cases in which some words ex-ist between repetition.
With cases II andC, positions of repetition directory indicatewhere an interruption occurs and which is areparandum, but with D case, do not.SERUI ~ can cope with cases A, tt and C.with syntactic breakA self-repalr comes with an interruption ofutterance.
Because an interruption may oc-cur anywhere in an utterance (even within aword), self-repaired utterance can contain asyntactic break.If this 1)reak can be detected, we can iden-tify an interruption point.same f l ' agment  repet i t ionWhen a sl)eaker interrupts an utterancewithin a word, a fl'agment of the interruptedword is left.
But he/she sometimes starts therepair with a word that begins with the slunefragment as in \[Ex.4\].\[F,x.4\] ten, tenji tanntou ,m kata t,o'.l'his can be treated as A repetition, butto investigate a within-word interruption~ wetreated it as a separate category.In this case, an interruption point is justafter a repeated fragment.
And if within-word interruptions are only made to repairan interrupted word, a rtq)armldum can beidentified as the repeated f ragmentw i th  unknown wordSometimes a fi'agment left clm be detectedas an unknown word.
For example, if a word"ketueki(blood)" is interrul)ted and a fi'ag-meat "ketue" is left, this fragment (:an bedetected because there is no Japanese word"ketue' .In this case, an interruption point is justafter an unknown word.
And the repa.ran-dum can be determined if the same conditionas the above case is sufficed.w i th  i so lated wordA fragment left by a within-wor.
'l interrup-tion is not alwa.ys detected as the same fl:a,g~meat repetition or an unknown word.
Forexample, it fragment "hen" can be left when"hontou"(real) is interrupted, but this stringcan l)e a wor(1 meaning "book".But such a word is always "isolated", tluttis, both two subtree.s in fig'l fail.In this (:as(.
', an interruption point is justafter an isolated word.
An(l repara.ndum canbe determined if the same condition as theabove ('ase is sufficed.w i thout  repet i t ion  of a s temBecause Japanese inflectional morphologyis complicated, speakers often make inflectionerrors.
To rel)alr such errors a speaker oftenstarts a relmi," without repetition of a stemas i,, \[l':x..q ,,or as i,, \[I,:?.6\].\[ICx.5\] itada i, ker ,  ,o  ka\[F,x.f;\] itada i, ita.da keru ,o  knIn these examph'.s, "ita.da" is it stem andthe Sl:)eak(w first tries to say "itada ita" or"ita(la i re" and then changes to "ita(la keru".I,t the case of \[l';x.6\], a repetition of a stemcan be used as a (:lue.

3: An isolated word595othersSERUP cannot cope with utterances of allthese categories.changed to wel l - formedA self-repaired utterance is occasionallyparsed successfully as a well-formed utter-ance that has a meaning that the speakerdoes not intend.
For example, in \[Ex.7\],a fragment "kyou" of a word "kyousan"(cosponsorship) is treated as a word "kyou"(today), and parsed successfully but themeaning of it is "cosponsor today".\[Ex.7\] kyou, kyonsan suruSome of these utterances can be detectedas an error in semantic interpreter.
And wcthink prosodic cues can be used effectively,because a fragment "kyou" and a word "kyou" is pronounced ifferently.
So far, SERUPcannot cope with such utterances, because ituses well-formed first method.dividing wordIn \[Ex.8\] the speaker starts repair withinword.\[Ex.8\] junji, bi ni desu neThe speaker tries to say "junbi ni desu ne",but makes a lexical error "junji".
IIe startsthe repair with a fragment "bi" of "junbi',instead of a complete word "junbi".
This isa very rare case.repet i t ion with different cate-gorySpeakers occasionally repair with differentcategory of words.
A human listener candraw some inference and find relation be-tween words, but automatic detection is dif-ficult.ambiguous repairIn \[gx.9\], it is ambiguous what kind of self-repair is made.\[gx.9\] apointo wo, nl, er, suuzitutyuu niThe speaker may repair a particle "wo"with "ni", or repair a fragment "ni" of aword "nisanniti" that has the same meaningof "suuzltu"(some days).
We cannot solvethis anablguity automatically.LARGE COI l .PUS-BASEDANALYS ISTo investigate ffectiveness of SERUP weanalyzed a large corpus called ADD(Eharaet al 1990).
ADD contains one million wordsof dialogues about registration to an inter-national conference over telephone.
ADD iscreated at ATR Interpreting Telephony Lab-oratories.There are 1.,082 self-repairs in the corpus.With these self-repairs, we investigate thecategories they belong to.
Table 1 shows theresult.DISCUSSIONIn sum, SERUP seems to cope with953(88.1%) of self-repairs.
We think SERUPis effective to Japanese self-repaired utter-&rices.Most of utterances that SERUP cannot~ope with are in tile category "Changed towell-formed".
As we mentioned, these utter-ances might be processed successfully withsemantic onstraints or prosodic cues.
If wecould implement hem, SERUP would copewith 1,064(98.3%) self-repairs.CONCLUDING 1-I.EMARKSWe proposed SERUP, a parser coping withself-repaired Japanese utterances.
SERUPuses some linguistic clues and translates aself-repaired utterance into well-formed ver-sion and parses it.
The result of large corpus-based analysis suggests that 88.1% of 1,082self-repairs can be processed by SERUP.Our future directions are to test the sys-tem with large grammar and lexicon and toincorporate prosodic processing.596Table 1: The result of ananlsysWith repetitionA repetitionB repetitionC repetitionD repetitionsame constituent repetition 141(13.0%)same category repetition 108(10.0%)same constituent repetition 96(8.9%)same category repetition 2(0.2%)same constituent repetition 136(12.6%)same category repetition 3(0.3%)same constituent repetition 4(0.4%)same category repetition 0(0%)With syntactic break.....
