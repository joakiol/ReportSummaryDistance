Systematicity and the Lexicon in Creative MetaphorTony VealeDepartment of Computer Science,University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 6, Ireland.Tony.veale@UCD.ieAbstractAptness is an umbrella term that covers amultitude of issues in the interpretation andgeneration of creative metaphor.
In this paperwe concentrate on one of these issues ?
thenotion of lexical systematicity  ?
and exploreits role in ascertaining the coherence of creativemetaphor relative to the structure of the targetconcept being described.
We argue that all elsebeing equal, the most apt metaphors are thosethat resonate most with the way the targetconcept is literally and metaphoricallyorganized.
As such, the lexicon plays a key rolein enforcing and recognizing aptness, insofar asthis existing organization will already havebeen lexicalized.
We perform our exploration inthe context of WordNet, and describe howrelational structures can be automaticallyextracted from this lexical taxonomy tofacilitate the interpretation of creativemetaphors.1   IntroductionWhen one considers the aptness of creativemetaphor and how one might measure it, one findsa whole range of issues lurking between theapparent unity of this umbrella term.
Thiscomplexity is compounded by the fact thatmetaphors operate at several different levels ofrepresentation simultaneously: the conceptuallevel, or the level of ideas; the lexical level, or thelevel of words; and the pragmatic level, or thelevel of intentions.
A metaphor may fall at any ofthese hurdles, either through a poor choice of asource concept, a poor choice of words incommunicating this concept, or in a failure toobserve the expectations of the context in whichthe metaphor is expressed.Some degree of aptness is afforded bymetaphors that compare semantic neighbors,inasmuch as the existence of a common taxonomicparent suggests that the source and target are in thesame, or at least similar, domains (e.g., see Way,1991).
For instance, metaphors that comparepoliticians to architects, or even geneticists tocartographers, derive some measure of aptnessfrom the fact that in each case the source and targetare sub-categories of the Profession category.However, since the most creative of metaphors arethose that make the greatest semantic leapsbetween the source and target concepts, suchcategory-hopping metaphors do not have theluxury of comparing concepts that are alreadydeemed similar in taxonomic terms, as evidencedby a common superordinate concept, but mustinstead establish a new basis for conveyingsimilarity that is not itself taxonomic.
Consider forinstance a corollary of the above metaphor inwhich ?
genomes are maps?
.
The aptness of thesesimilarity-creating metaphors is instead a measureof the isomorphism between the relationalstructures of the source and target, so that theconcepts with the greatest structural overlap willoften produce the most apt metaphors.
In thisrespect, metaphoric aptness is a function of whatGentner terms the systematicity of a structure-mapping.
According to (Gentner, 1983) and thestructure-mapping school of thought (e.g., see alsoVeale and Keane, 1997), the best interpretations ofa metaphor or analogy are those that systematicallypair-off the greatest amount of connected relationalstructure in each concept.
We refer to this kind ofstructural aptness as internal systematicity, sinceany sense of aptness arises out of a coherencebetween the internal structures of the conceptsbeing mapped.Lakoff and Johnson (1980) also place a strongemphasis on metaphoric systematicity, but in theirhands the notion is construed in more externalterms.
To L&J, systematicity is a measure of thegenerativity of a metaphoric schema, so that thesame schema (such as Life is a Journey) can serveas the deep structure for a wide variety of different,but mutually systematic, surface metaphors (suchas ?
my job has hit a rocky patch?
and ?
my careerhas stalled?
).
In this view, systematicity is ameasure of how much a metaphor resonates andcoheres with existing metaphors for thinking aboutthe target concept, so that when viewedcollectively, they together suggest the operation ofa common underlying schema.
This view ofsystematicity is external to the concepts involvedsince it predicates their aptness to each other onthe existence of other structures (metaphorschemas) into which they can be coherentlyconnected.In this paper we argue that the lexicon is centralto the determination of both kinds of systematicity,internal and external, especially if one is anadherent of the generative lexicon view of wordmeaning as championed by (Pustejovsky, 1991).
Insuch a lexicon we can expect to find precisely thekind of relational structure needed to performstructure mapping and thereby measure the internalsystematicity of a metaphor like ?
a passport is atravel diary?
.
In addition, we can expect to find thelexicalized metaphor structures that represent thesurface manifestations of existing modes ofthought, and it is against these structures that theexternal systematicity of an interpretation can bemeasured.This research is conducted in the context ofWordNet (Miller, 1995; Fellbaum, 1998), acomprehensive lexical knowledge-base of English.The structure of WordNet makes explicit some ofthe relationships needed to construct a generativelexicon, most obviously the formal (taxonomic)and constitutive (meronymic) aspects of wordmeaning.
But to truly test a model of metaphoricinterpretation on a large-scale, it is necessary toaugment these relationships with the telic andagentive components that are not encoded directlybut merely alluded to in the textual glossesassociated with each sense entry.
In the sections tofollow we describe a mechanism for automatingthe extraction of these relationships (in the samevein as (Harabagiu et al 1999), and for using themto generative apt interpretations for metaphorsinvolving WordNet entries.2   Qualia Extraction from GlossesIn a generative lexicon, the core elements of wordmeaning are represented by a nexus of relationscalled a qualia structure, which ties together theformal (i.e., hierarchical relations), constitutive(i.e., meronymic), telic (i.e., functional) andagentive (i.e., construction/creation) aspects of aword.
For instance, a diary is formally a kind of?book?
that constitutes a ?collection of personalwritings?
whose telic purpose is to ?record?
theobservations of the agent that ?compiles?
it.
Whena word like ?
diary?
is used metaphorically, thisrelational nexus provides the structure fordetermining the internal systematicity of anyinterpretation.
For instance, it is apt to describe apassport as a kind of travel diary since both arekinds of book (formal) that record (telic) travelexperiences.We describe here an approach to qualia extraction from WordNet glosses that balances coverage with quality: by attempting to extract a relatively narrow slice of the relational structure inherent in WordNet glosses, we can be confident of quite high levels of competence.
Nevertheless, eventhis narrow slice yields a significant amount of qualia structure, since WordNet aleady encodes formal and constitutive relations in its taxonomic and meronymic links between synsets.
We thus concentrate our efforts on the extraction of telic (i.e., goal-oriented) and agentive (activity-oriented) lexical relations.
We exploit the fact that the agentive and telic aspects of lexico-conceptual structure are often expressed using nominalized verbs that implicitly encode relational structure.
A small number ofhighly productive morphology rules1 can thus be used to connect ?observe?
to ?observer?
and ?observation?
(and vice versa), ?specialize?, to ?specializer?
and ?specialization?, and so on.
For example, the WordNet concepts  {botanist} and {philologist} are both defined with glosses that explicitly employ the term ?specializing?, thus evoking the concept {specializer} (a hyponym of {expert}) Now, because {specializer} is compatible with the concepts {botanist} and {philologist} by virtue of being a hyponym of {person}, this in turn suggests that {botanist} and {philologist}  should be seen as hyponyms of {specializer}, making specializer_of is an appropriate telic relation for each.
Thus, using a combination of derivational morphology and simple taxonomic reasoning, the relational structure specializer_of:specializationcan be associated with each concept.
Since this structure is not already encoded in WordNet, it provides an additional dimension of similarity in any metaphoric mapping.
Broad clues as to the syntactic form of the gloss (such as the use of the passive voice) are also a valuable source of extraction information, especially when they can be robustly inferred from a simple combination of keyword analysis and inflectional morphology.
For example, the passive voice should cause an extracted relation to be inverted, as in the case of {dupe}, whose WordNet gloss is ?a person who is swindled or tricked?.
The resulting relational structure is thus:1The developers of WordNet have recently announced thathand-coded morpho-semantic links will be added to futureversions of WordNet, to make explicit the relationshipbetween verbs and their nominal forms, thus obviating theneed for such rules while making the extraction task evenmore reliable.
{dupe} ?
of_swindler:swindler ?
of_trickster:tricksterNote that the extraction process is too shallowto do very much with the disjunctive ?
or?
presentin the gloss of {dupe}, as this is more a process ofinformation extraction than full natural-languageparsing.
Thus, it simply conjoins any relationshipthat can be reliably extracted with morphologicalcues into an overall relational structure.
Thisstructure is simply a bag of relations at present,which we choose to present here as connected viaconjunction.
Future versions of the extractionprocess may attempt to impose a more elaborateinter-connecting structure on the relationships thatare extracted, but for the present, an unstructuredbag is sufficient to support a consideration ofmetaphor in WordNet.Since morphology alone is not a sufficientlyreliable guide for extraction purposes, the approachcrucially requires the WordNet taxonomy to act asa vital sanity-check for any extracted relationship.
In general, it is sensible to associate a relation r with a concept c if the nominalization of r denotes a concept that belongs to the same taxonomic category as c; thus, it is sensible to ascribe a specializer_of relation to {botanist} only because {specializer} and {botanist} each specify a sub-category of {person}.
However, this broad injunction finds an important exception in metonymic contexts.
Consider the WordNet gloss for {diary, journal},  ?a daily record of (usually private) experiences and observations?, which yields the extracted relationships of_diarist:diarist, of_experience: experience, recorder_of:recordingand observer_of:observation.
A taxonomic sanity-check reveals that {diary, journal}, as a sub-category of {communication}, is not compatible with either {recorder} or {observer}, both sub-categories of {person}.
However, it is taxonomically compatible with the objects of these relations, {recording} and {observation}, which suggests that a diary is both the object of, and a metonym for, the diarist as observer and recorder.
This metonymy is most evident in the familiar address ?dear diary?, in which the diary is conceived as a personified counterpart of the observer.
The concept {diary, journal} therefore yields the modified relational structure:{diary, journal} ?
*observer_of:observation?
*recorder_of:recording?
of_experience:experienceThe (*) here signals that the observer_of and recorder_of relations hold metonymically rather than literally.
The presence of these relationships facilitate creative uses of the concept {diary} that follow the general pattern whereby artifacts are viewed from an intentional stance.
For example, consider that the WordNet gloss for the concept {witness, spectator} is ?a close observer?, so that the following relational structure is extracted:{witness, spectator}    ?
observer_of:observationIt now becomes apt to metaphorically consider a diary to be a witness to one?s life experiences.
In structure-mapping terms, this aptness is reflected in the internal systematicity of finding a key relationship,  observer_of:observation, common to each of the concepts {diary} and {witness, spectator}.3   Internal SystematicityBecause purely taxonomic interpretations arecreated on the basis of commonalities, they tend tobe highly symmetric, as in the case of similes suchas ?
credit unions are like banks?
and ?
gamblers arelike alcoholics?
.
In contrast, the most creativemetaphors are asymmetric (Ortony, 1991), sincethey impose the highly-developed relationalstructure of the source concept onto that of  theless-developed target (see Lakoff and Johnson,1980; Gentner, 1983; Veale and Keane, 1997).Without this imposition of relational structure,metaphor can be used only to highlight existingsimilarities rather than to actually create new ones,and is thus robbed of its creative function.
The projection of relational structure can be performed either literally or figuratively.
In a literal interpretation, the relational structure of the source is simply instantiated with the target concept, so for example, a literal ?travel diary?
is a diary that contains travel recordings and travel observations.
In contrast, figurative interpretations first attempt to find a target domain correspondence for thesource concept, and then project the relational structure of the source onto this counterpart (Gentner, 1983).
For instance, WordNet contains a variety of concepts that are formally similar to {diary, journal} and which also mention ?travel?
in their glosses, such as {travel_guidebook} and {passport}.
?travel?+  {diary, journal}   ?
{passport}  +  *observer_of:travel:observation?
*recorder_of:travel:recording?
of_experience:travel:experienceProjecting the relational structure of {diary, journal} onto {passport} causes the latter to be seen as a journal of travel observations and experiences, and indeed, many travelers retain old passports for this very purpose.
Metaphors are most apt when projection highlights a latent relational structure that already exists in the target concept (Ortony, 1979).
For example, the compound ?pastry surgeon?
can be understood taxonomically as referring to {pastry_cook},  since like {surgeon} it is a sub-category of {person}.
But to fully appreciate why {surgeon} is more apt than other hyponyms of {person}, like {astrologer} say, one must look to the shared relational structure that is highlighted by the metaphor.
WordNet 1.6 defines a surgeon as a ?physician who specializes in surgery?, while a pastry cook is glossed as ?a chef who specializes in pastry?.
Both {surgeon} and {pastry_cook} thus become associated with the relationship specializer_of:specialism.
This common relational structure facilitates the measurement of what we have termed ?internal systematicity?
(in the Gentner sense).
Thus, {surgeon} is seen as an apt vehicle for {pastry_cook} as both are people that specialize in a particular field.
Instantiation of the shared structure leads to the following interpretation:?pastry?
+ {surgeon} ?
{pastry_cook} + specializer_of: pastry:surgeryOne can reasonably argue that much moresophisticated interpretations are available tohuman readers of this metaphor, e.g., that pastrycooking and surgery are both delicate operationsinvolving special training, both are performed withspecialized instruments in very clean surroundings,etc.
But given the inherent limitations of workingwith an existing semi-structured knowledge sourcesuch as WordNet, as opposed to a dedicated, hand-crafted knowledge-base, ?
pastry specialist?
mustsuffice as a generalization for these richerinterpretations.
Alternately, one might argue that itis ?
pastry?
rather than ?
surgeon?
that undergoesmetaphoric reinterpretation, so that the phrasedenotes a literal surgeon that operates onmetaphoric pastries, such as movie starlets orsupermodels.
In this current work we choose tofocus on the relational potential for the head wordto metaphorically denote a relationally similar, ifsometimes semantically distant, referent, whileacknowledging that this illuminates just one partof the picture.Nonetheless, interpretations like ?
pastryspecialist?
can be given more credibility if onedelves deeper into its metaphoric ramifications toconsider the recursive sub-metaphors that itimplies.
For instance, as stated in the analysisabove,  ?
pastry surgeon?
implies the plausibility ofa meaningful interpretation for ?
pastry surgery?
.This choice to delve deeper, and recursivelydetermine an appropriate interpretation of ?
pastrysurgery?
, is left to the comprehender, who mayinstead choose to read the metaphor as a simplerequest to view pastry chefs as specialists.
But thisraises the question of how much structure must beshared for an interpretation to appear apt ratherthan merely inept.
For example, one can equallywell say ?
pastry linguist?
or ?
pastry geologist?
tohighlight the specialist nature of pastry chefs, since{geologist}  and {linguist} are also associated withan extracted specializer_of relationship.
Whatmakes these alternate metaphors seem clumsy isthe difficulty in assigning appropriateinterpretations to the recursive metaphors that theyimply: ?
pastry geologist?
implies the metaphor?
pastry geology?
, while ?
pastry linguist?
impliesthe metaphor ?
pastry linguistics?
.(?)
?pastry?
+ {linguist} ?
{pastry_cook} + specializer_of:pastry:linguisticsThere is little that can be done to put a sensible interpretation on ?pastry linguistics?
in WordNet, given the taxonomic and relational structure of {pastry} and {linguistics}.
In contrast, ?pastry surgery?
has more potential for meaningful interpretation using WordNet structures.
There exists a sense of surgery that denotes a discipline in the natural sciences, and from {pastry} a broad search will find the concept {dietetics}, another discipline of the natural sciences dedicated to food preparation.
This analogue of {surgery} can be found by first considering all concepts associated with ?pastry?, then all concepts associated with ?baked goods?, then ?foodstuff?
and ?food?, until an appropriately similar candidate is found.
{dietetics}    ?
the scientific study of food preparation and intakeThis is not a particularly well-known concept, so it would be difficult to argue that this forms the cornerstone of an easily understood metaphor like ?pastry surgeon?.
However, the concept {dietetics}does at least concretize, in WordNet terms, the idea that one can take a precise, scientific view of food preparation, and it is the plausibility of this notion that allows us to make sense of pastry preparation as a surgical activity.
There is no true substitute for situated experience of the world, but when it comes to metaphor interpretation using lexical resources like WordNet, we should be willing to use any lexical precedent we can find.As an alternate strategy, we can seek to recruit a sub-category of surgery that can be modified in some way to accommodate the concept {pastry}.
One such category is {plastic_surgery}, whose gloss reveals a concern with the reformation of body tissue.
{plastic_surgery}  ?
surgery concerned with therapeutic or cosmetic reformation of tissue?
?pastry?
+ {surgery} ?
{plastic_surgery}  + reformation_of: pastry:tissueThis interpretation requires that an existing form ofsurgery is recruited and adapted so as toaccommodate the concept {pastry} .
In taxonomicterms, {plastic_surgery} is perhaps mostappropriately adapted for this purpose, since{tissue} and {pastry}  are both hyponyms of{substance} in WordNet.
Of course, the intendedsense of ?
tissue?
in the above gloss is not {tissue,tissue_paper} but {tissue} as a hyponym of{body_part} .
However, creative metaphors ofteninvolve a degree of domain incongruence, wherebya given word has a different meaning in the sourceand target domains (Ortony, 1979).
In fact, onemight say that domain incongruence is essential tocreative metaphor, since interpretation willnecessitate the grafting of structure from radicallydistant parts of the concept ontology, and suchgrafts may fail if the features involved maintaintheir strict, source-dependent definitions.4   External SystematicityMetaphors appear more apt when theysystematically evoke, or connect into, establishedmodes of metaphoric thought.
This is systematicityconsidered from an external vantage as describedby (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980).
For example,when processing the metaphor ?
politicalmechanic?
, several concepts can be reached from?
political?
that prove to be taxonomicallycompatible with {mechanic}, among them{political_leader} , {political_scientist} and{machine_politician}.
However, closer inspectionof the projected structure suggests that the last,{machine_politician}, is the most systematic:?political?
+ {mechanic}?
{machine_politician}    + machinist_of: political:machineBecause the extracted qualia structure for{mechanic} hinges on the relationshipmachinist_of:machine, there is a suggestive lexicalsystematicity with the concept{machine_politician}.
Furthermore, theinstantiated structure creates a fortuitous pairingpolitical:machine, which already exists inWordNet as the lexicalized metaphor{political_machine}.
This marks ?
politicalmechanic?
as a systematic outgrowth of theestablished metaphor schema Political System AsMachine (whose corollary is Political Operativesas Fixers).
The same schema comes into playwhen interpreting the metaphor ?
politicaldraftsman?
, whose WordNet gloss also evokesimages of machinery.Lexicalized metaphors like {political_machine},{political_science} and {political_campaign} actas the recognizable landmarks in the search spaceof possible interpretations for novel metaphors.
Soif an interpretation can be generated that connectsinto an established metaphor, it has a greaterprovenance than one that stands alone.
Here aresome further examples:{torchbearer}  ?
a leader in a campaign or movement?
?political?
+ {torchbearer} ?
{political_leader} + campaigner_of:political:campaign{missionary}  ?
someone who attempts to convert   others to a [...]  program?
?political?
+ {missionary} ?
{political_commissar} + programmer_of: political:program{sociologist}  ?
a social scientist who studies [...] human society?
?political?
+ {sociologist} ?
{political_scientist} + scientist_of: political:scienceThese examples are fortuitous in the sense that the instantiation of qualia structure directly suggests an existing WordNet concept.
In most cases, however, the external systematicity becomes visible only upon recursive consideration of the instantiated structure as a source of metaphor in itself.
Consider the metaphor ?genetic cartographer?, for which {geneticist} is retrieved as a thematically similar concept:{cartographer}    ?
a person who makes maps{geneticist}      ?
a person who specializes in genetics?
?genetic?
+ {cartographer} ?
{geneticist} + mapper_of: genetic:mappingThere is no denotation for ?
genetic mapping?
inWordNet, so at first blush the above interpretationfails to connect into an existing lexicalizedmetaphor.
However, when we recursively considerthe combination ?
genetic mapping?
as a metaphorin itself, we obtain the following interpretation:?genetic?
+ {mapping} ?
{chromosome_mapping}??
the process of locating genes   on a chromosomeThis allows us to recognize ?genetic mapping?
as an alternate way of denoting the concept {chromosome_mapping}, while the fact that a mapping metaphor has already been lexicalized in the genetics domain allows us to recognize the external systematicity inherent in the interpretation of ?geneticist as cartographer?.
This WordNet entry serves to ground the sub-metaphor of genetic mapping in an existing concept, allowing the recursive analysis of sub-metaphors to halt at this point.
A ?genetic cartographer?
is thus a geneticist that performs a specialized kind of map-making called chromosome mapping, where the terrain that is mapped is biological and information-theoretic rather than geological or geographic.
Though chromosome mapping is itself a metaphor, its independent existence in WordNet means that it does not need to be justified in the context of an interpretation of ?genetic cartographer?, and for the purposes of analysis can be treated as a literal stopping-point.5   The Challenge of AptnessI suspect we can all agree that aptness involves a complex interaction of different issues that arise from lexical and conceptual choice.
The real question is the degree to which each of these issues influences a particular interpretation, and the weighting, if any, that is to be given to each component of aptness in an algorithmic model.
Take the metaphor ?political surgeon?
: by considering the concepts in the semantic neighborhood of {surgeon} reachable via the thematic cue ?political?, we find the following competing interpretations:{political_scientist}  ?
a social scientist specializing in the study of government{spin_doctor}      ?
a spokesperson for a political partyor candidate who tries to forestall negative publicityThe first of these interpretations,{political_scientist}, is apt for reasons of internalsystematicity, as both it and {surgeon} have anextracted qualia structure that contains aspecializer_of:specialization relationship.
Thisleads to the following interpretation:?political?
+ {surgeon}?
{political_scientist}+ specializer_of:political:specializationThe second interpretation, {spin_doctor}, does notexhibit the same internal systematicity, but it doesexhibit an external systematicity of sorts: the headof this compound term, ?
doctor?
, denotes aconcept {doctor, physician} that is a hypernym ofthe metaphoric vehicle, {surgeon}.It would seem a matter of personal choice as towhich interpretation should be privileged here, asdifferent listeners may attach more weight to thepresence of internal systematicity in{political_scientist} than to the suggestion ofexternal systematicity in {spin_doctor}, and viceversa.
This suggests that the problem of aptnessdetermination involves a great deal of hiddenparameters yet to be made explicit in any model ofinterpretation.
As researchers interested incomputational treatments of metaphor, our goalthen should be to explicate what factors we can inalgorithmic and representational terms, to providethe basic inventory of components needed toproceed with our investigation into this elusive andconsiderably vexing phenomenon.
In this paper wehave argued that the natural place to compile thisinventory is the lexicon, since this acts as thebridge between word and world knowledge andaptness is a phenomenon that hops freely betweenboth.ReferencesGeorge Lakoff and Mark Johnson.
