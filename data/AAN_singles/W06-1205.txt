CPs are particularlypervasive in Hindi and other Indo-Aryan languages, but an usage accountdriven by corpus-based identificationof these constructs has not beenpossible since single-language systemsbased on rules and statisticalapproaches require reliable tools (POStaggers, parsers, etc.)
that areunavailable for Hindi.
This paperhighlights the development of firstsuch database based on the simple ideaof projecting POS tags across anEnglish-Hindi parallel corpus.
The CPtypes considered include adjective-verb(AV), noun-verb (NV), adverb-verb(Adv-V), and verb-verb (VV)composites.
CPs are hypothesizedwhere a verb in English is projectedonto a multi-word sequence in Hindi.While this process misses some CPs,those that are detected appear to bemore reliable (83% precision, 46%recall).
The resulting database listsusage instances of 1439 CPs in 4400sentences.1 IntroductionA "pain in the neck" (Sag et al, 2002) forNLP in languages of the Indo-Aryan family(e.g.
Hindi-Urdu, Bangla and Kashmiri) is thefact that most verbs (nearly half of allinstances in Hindi) occur as complexpredicates - multi-word complexes whichfunction as a single verbal unit in terms ofargument and event structure (Hook, 1993;Butt and Geuder, 2003; Raina and Mukerjee,2005).
Moreover, most of these languagesbeing resource-poor, even a proper corpus-based characterization of such CPs hasremained an elusive goal.In this paper we construct the first corpus-based lexicon of CPs in Hindi based onprojecting POS tags across parallel English-Hindi corpora.
While such approachessometimes leave out some CPs, the ones thatare identified are seen to be quite robust.
As aresult, this appears to be a good first approachfor identifying the majority of CPs along withusage data.
Moreover, since the languagespecific input in the procedure is minimal, itcan be easily extended to other languages withsimilar multi word expressions.2 Complex PredicatesCPs are characterized by a predicate or host -typically a noun (N), adjective (A), verb (V),or adverb (Adv) - followed by a light verb(LV),  a grammaticalized version of a mainverb, which contributes little telic significanceto the composite predicate.
As an example, theEnglish verb "describe" may be rendered inHindi as the Noun-Verb complex ??????
+??
?, varNan kar, "description + do".
Analysisbased on a non-CP lexicon might assign theverbal head as kar (do), whereas functionalaspects such as the argument structure aredetermined by the noun host varNan"description".
An example of a V-V CP may28be ???
+ ??
?, kar de "do+give", where the lightverb de ?give?
imposes a completive aspect onthe action kar ?do?.Identifying such constructs is a significanthurdle for NLP tasks ranging from phrasalparsing (Ray et al, 2003, Shrivastava et al,2005), translation (where each complex maybe treated as a lexical unit in the targetlanguage), predicate-argument analysis, tosemantic delineation.
In addition to thecomputational aspects, a mere listing of allCPs occurring in the corpus would provide animportant resource for tasks such asconstructing WordNets (Narayan et al,2002)and linguistic analysis of CPs (Butt andGeuder, 2003).Rule-based approaches to identifying CPsare not very effective since there do not seemto be any clear set of rules that can be used todistinguish CPs from non-CP constructs(contrast, for example, the composite CP???????
???
anumati de "permission+give" withthe non-composite N-V structure ??????
??
?kitaab de "give the book").
Even where suchrules do exist, they depend on semanticproperties such as the fact that book is aphysical object which can be given in thephysical sense (Raina and Mukerjee, 2005).However, in the translated form, the formermay show up as a verb, whereas the latterinvariably will be a N+V, so the tag projectionwould rule out the latter as a CP.Here we adopt a parallel corpus-basedapproach to creating a database of complexpredicates in Hindi.
The procedure canpotentially be duplicated to most Indo-Aryanlanguages.
The motivation is that a CP may betranslated as a direct verb in other languages,and POS Projection across Parallel Corporathen project a tag of Verb for this expression inthe source language.
Additional linguisticconstraints are used to determine if the multi-word cluster qualifies as a CP.
These include acheck list of LVs that can occur with A, N, Vand Adv constituents of a multi wordpredicate.Let us consider some examples from the CPlexicon constructed from the EMILLE parallelcorpus (McEnery et al, 2000) of 200,000words, collected from leaflets prepared by theUK government for immigrants.
Examples ofthese different complexes may be:(1) N+V:  ?????

varNan kar?description + do?:?????
??
???????

?29Of the four classes cited above, the NV andAV classes are the most productive.
The AdvVclass is highly restricted, confined to a fewadverbs.
The VV class is highly selective forits constituents, apparently driven by semanticconsiderations.Identifying CPs in text is crucial toprocessing since it serves as a clausal head,and other elements in the phrase are licensedby the complex as a whole and not by theverbal head.
The semantic import of the host-verb complex varies along a composabilitycontinuum, at one end of which we havepurely idiomatic CPs, while at the other end,the CPs may be recoverable from itsconstituents.
For example, ?????????+??
?,vyavhaar kar, "behave+do" has a sense of"use,treat" in English, reflecting clearly anidiomatic usage.Detecting CPs is made difficult by thediffering degrees of productivity for differentclasses of open-class host, which reflects theapplicability of unrestricted rules.
Also, verbsparticipating in CPs are very selective; e.g.
inNV and AV CPs the verb is typically restrictedto ho, kar and the like, whereas in VVconstructs ho reflects auxiliary usage, but adifferent set of verbs appear.
The open classword (host) tends to be uninflected, and onlythe light verb (LV) carries tense, agreementand aspect markers.
Even the host Vparticipating in a VV CP is always uninflected.As an instance of the difficulty in detectingCPs, consider the so called permissive CP(Hook, 1993; Butt and Geuder, 2003), as in thekarne+de ?do-nom +give?
example here,where the host verb appears to be  inflected:(5)  Raam ne sitaa ko   kaam  karne     diyaaRam-erg  sita-acc  work  do-nom  give-past?Ram let Sita do the work?However, this does not actually reflect CPusage, and is better parsed as:(6) [S [NP raam ne] [VP [NP sitaa ko][VP kaam karne] [V  diyaa] VP] S]Another challenge for CP identification isthat the constituents may be separated ?sometimes quite widely.3 CPs from Parallel ProjectionIdentifying MWEs from corpora is clearlyan area of increasing research emphasis.
Forresource-rich languages, one may use a parsetree and look for mutual information statisticsin head-complement collocations, and alsocompare it with other "similar" collocations todetermine if something is unusual about agiven construct (Lin, 1999).
As of nowhowever, even POS-tagging remains achallenge for languages such as Hindi, therebymaking it necessary to seek alternate methods.Parallel corpus based approaches toinducing monolingual part-of-speech taggers,base noun-phrase bracketers, named-entitytaggers and morphological analyzers forFrench, Chinese and other languages haveshown quite promising results (Yarowsky etal., 2001).
These approaches use minimallinguistic input and have been increasinglyeffective with the growth in the availability oflarge parallel corpuses.
The algorithmessentially attempts to word-align the targetlanguage sentences with the source languagesentences and then use a probabilistic modeltry to project the linguistic information fromthe source language.
Since these are statisticalalgorithms, the accuracy of results depends onthe size of the corpus used.In our approach, we first use a similarapproach to word-align an English-Hindiparallel corpus.
The English sentences aretagged and the tags are projected to Hindisentences.
We observe that words which aretagged as verbs by projection and have POStag as N, A, Adv or V in the Hindi lexicon, andare followed by an LV, are usually CPs.Clearly the CP detection is limited to thoseinstances where a CP in the target language istranslated as a single verb in English.
Forexample, a phrase such as ????
?
?, jawaab de,"answer give", may be rendered in Englisheither as the verb ?answer?
or as the EnglishCP "give answer".
In the latter case (anexample appearing quite frequently in thiscorpus), the correct POS projection wouldlabel jawaab as [N answer], thus failing todetect the CP.
While this may not besignificant in certain tasks (e.g.
translation), itmay be relevant in others (e.g.
semanticprocessing).30Furthermore, the POS tagging process isinherently biased towards projecting tags forfrequently encountered constituents first, andthis may lead to some constituents in certainCPs being flagged with their normal POS tags,resulting in missed CPs.
However, this doesnot result in false positives, since non-CPconstructs often fail on other criteria (e.g.
listof LVs).For reasons discussed above, many CPs arenot identifiable through parallel corpusmethods.
Some examples include ???????????
?, ?????
????
?, ?????
?????.
Our databaseis therefore correspondingly thin for thesetypes of CPs.With VV CPs, it is difficult to distinguishbetween CPs and other related structures suchas the passive construct or serial verbs.
Theseare illustrated below.
(7) Passive???
??
??
????
??
??
?????
??
?Aisa   bhii    ho   saktaa   hai      ki      credit  noteIt     emph   be    can     aux     that   credit  note?????
???
??
????
?
??
???
??
?siraf      kuch    hii      dino         tak    kaam     meonly       few    emph   days       for     use       in????
??
????
??
?laaya     jaa     sakta     hobring    go       can       be?It is quite possible that the credit note can beput to use only for a few days.?
(8) Serial verb??
????
????
????
?????
??
???
?voh   laDkaa   mujhe  apni   kitaab     de   gayaaThat    boy      me       own    book    give  go-past?That boy gave me his book and went away.
?It appears that passive can be reliably ruledout using the root verb criterion for VVs, sincethe main verb in passive is always in aninflected form.
No comparable formal criterionexists for the serial verb, where also the POStagger will identify both constituents as verbs.However, these verbs are relatively rarecompared to CPs.4 Hindi-English POS Projection4.1 Data Resources and PreprocessingWe used the EMILLE1 corpus Hindi-Englishparallel corpus, with approximately 200,000words in non-sentenced aligned translations inUnicode 16 format (McEnery et al, 2000).
Thetexts consist of different types of informationleaflets originally in English, along withtranslations in Hindi, Bangla, Gujarati and anumber of South Asian languages.
Closeranalysis of the corpus reveals that the corpus isnot completely sentence aligned and also thatthe translations are not very correct in manycases.
Hindi versions of the manuals tend to bemore verbose than their English translations.For the word alignment algorithm weneeded a sentence aligned corpus but due tothe small size of the parallel corpus, thestandard sentence alignment systems did notgive very high accuracy levels.
Therefore, thewhole data was manually sentence aligned toproduce a sentence aligned parallel corpus ofabout nine thousand sentences and 140thousand words which is used in this work.4.2 Word alignmentWe have used IBM models proposed byBrown (Brown et al, 1993) for word aligningthe parallel corpus.
The IBM models havebeen widely used in statistical machinetranslation.
Given a Hindi sentence h, we seekthe English sentence e that maximizes P(e | h);the "most likely?
translation.Now P (e | h) = P (e) * P (h | e) / P (h)argmax-e P(e | h) = argmax-e P(e) * P(h | e).P (e) is modeled by the N-gram model .We areinterested in P (h | e).
We used the Giza++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2000), based on theExpectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, tocalculate these probability measures.
At theend of this step, we have a word-to-wordmapping between the English and Hindisentences.
A "NULL" is used in the Englishsentences to account for the unaligned Hindiwords from the corresponding Hindi sentence.1 http://bowland-files.lancs.ac.uk/corplang/emille/31Figure 1.
Example of projection of POS tags from English to Hindi.
Here the phrase "shikaayat kar" is projectedfrom the English "complain" and is tagged as V+V.
Since shikaayat is a N in the Hindi lexicon, this phrase isidentified as an CP of N+V type.4.3 Tagging English SentencesThe English sentences are POS-tagged usingthe Brill Tagger (Brill, 1994), a rule basedtagger which uses more or less the same tagsas the Penn Treebank project (Marcus, 1994).Since for our purposes, we did not need a verydetailed subcategorization of the tag set forHindi, the English tag set was reduced bymerging the subcategorization tags of a fewcategories.
Thus  all noun distinctions in thePen Treebank tagset based on number, personetc  were merged in our treatment of the Nounclass.
Similarly in the case of verbs, wemerged distinctions based on tense, person,aspect and participles etc.
Subclasses ofadverbs and case forms of pronouns were alsomerged.
Rest of the POS categories wereretained.
The ?NULL?
word in the Englishsentences, used for unaligned Hindi words inthe parallel corpus, was given a ?NULL?
tag.4.4 Projection of Tags to HindiThe reduced English tags were projected toHindi words based on the word alignmentsobtained earlier.
A sample alignment andtagged projection is shown in Figure 1.
As thefigure shows, postpositional markers, whichare relatively more frequent in Hindi aremapped to the ?NULL?
word in the Englishsentence.Since the amount of training data is verysmall, the statistical word alignment algorithmis not adequate enough to align all wordscorrectly.
To overcome this weakness, weapply some filtering conditions to removealignment errors, especially in smallersentences.
This filtering is based on twoparameters: a) Fertility count (rf), which isdefined as the number of Hindi words anEnglish word maps to, and b) Acceptance level(k), defined as the number of words acceptablein a sentence with fertility count greater thanequal to rf.
These two parameters are selectedto minimize errors in the groundtruth sample-set, and the resulting filtering heuristics usedare presented in Table 1.Table-1.
Filtering CriteriaSentenceLengthFertilityCount(rf)AcceptanceLevel(k)1.
1-5 2 12.
5-10 3 23.
10-15 3 34.
15-20 4 35.
20-25 4 36.
25-35 4 37.
35+ 4 34.5 Identification of CP?sAfter the filtering is done we observe that theCP?s are usually translated as a direct verb inEnglish.
So if the projected tag of a Hindiword is Verb and the normal POS tag of theword in the Hindi dictionary is N, A, V or Advand the word is followed by one of themembers from the LV set, then we classify themulti word expression as N+V, A+V, V+V, orAdv+V CP respectively.4.6 Fragments of the CP LexiconA sample fragment of the CP lexicon is shownin Figure-2.
The whole corpus is availableonline2.
Since we do not have a verycomprehensive Hindi dictionary we are notable to classify many CP?s that are identifiedin their respective class.
On a test with 4400sentences we identified a total of 1439 CPs2 The lexicon is available online athttp://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/language/CP-database.htm32Figure 2.
Example of the CP lexicon for ?shikaayat kr?with the following distribution:  N+V: 788,A+V: 107, Adv+V: 18 and V+V: 526.4.7 Errors in CP identificationCP identification in the test data setinvolved certain ground truth decisions such asexcluding verbal composites with regularauxiliary verb ?
?, hai corresponding to theEnglish finite verb ?be?
and the progressive?????
raha ?-ing (progressive)?.
CPs withidiomatic usage were included, and so were theCPs with a passive verb, although the latterwere not counted in computational scores.
Thetesting was done on a small set of about 120groundtruth sentences in which the CP?s werecarefully identified manually.
We get aprecision of about 82.5% and a recall of 40%with our CP finding algorithm.
If the idiomaticCPs is not considered the recall goes upto46%.Several types of errors are observed in thecorpus-derived results.
A False Negative(missed CP) error arising due to the Englishcomplex predicate is shown in Figure 3.
Anumber of False Positives arise due toinadequacy in the Hindi dictionary ?
the onlinedictionary of Hindi we used was missing manylexemes.
A further problem is homography ?e.g.
the word kii (do-past) appears both as anpossessive marker, as well as the past-tenseform for the verb kara (do), occurringfrequently (with jaa, go) in adjectival clauseconstructions.
This has been mis-tagged inabout one in ten instances (approx 0.2% cases),with hosts such as shikaayat (complaint), baat(talk), dekhvaal (looking-after), madad (help)etc.
Similarly, the word un can appear as anoun (wool) or a pronoun (he).
Furthermore,while considerable care was taken to manuallysentence align the parallel corpus, a number oftypos and other problems remain, some ofthem show up as false positives.4.8 Discontinuous CP identificationIn the results above, we have made noattempt to identify discontinuous CPs, i.e.,instances where other phonological materialintervenes between the constituents of a CP,As an example, consider(9) ????
?
?, jaanch ho, ?inspection-be????
???
??
????
????
??
?
?agar   kaar  kii    jaanch    pahale   hii       hoif       car  poss  inspection earlier emph happen????
??
,   ??
???????
??????
?chuki       hai         to      report      mangiyecomp.
be-present  then  report    ask-imp-hon?If the car has already been inspectedplease ask to see the report.
?These separated multi-word expressionsconstitute some of the most difficult problemsfor any language ?
for example, one maycompare these with English phrasal verbs like?give up?, which can sometimes occur indiscontinuity.
However, owing to the relativelyfree word order in Hindi, the discontinuousCPs in Hindi are separated by a variety ofstructures ranging from simple emphatic orfocal particles and negation markers  to clausal33Figure 3.
Here the projection process fails to detect the CP "shikaayat karna" since the English translation is alsoCP "make complaint".
Improvements in MWE detection in English can possibly help reduce such errors.Figure 4.
A verb in the source language, ?inspected?
projects to jaanch (inspection)+ ho (be) + chukaa hai (aux),although they are separated by the phrase pahale-bhi (already).
Thus, using source and target languagestogether.
the parallel projection method may have the potential for discovering discontinuous CPs as well.constituents.
How these structures are to beencoded in a computational lexicon is acomplex matter that takes us beyond CPidentification (Villavicencio et al 2004).
Butwhile rule-based identification of suchconstructs is problematic, we feel that POS-tagprojection holds considerable promise in thisdirection.In the algorithm above we have onlyconsidered the target language (Hindi) tagsafter the parallel tagging is completed.
If inaddition, we also consider the source languagetag and its radiation the CP probabilities maybe redefined in a manner that helps capturesome discontinuous CPs as well.
Thus, ifEnglish ?complain?
radiates to shikaayat andkara, the inherent CP can be detected even inthe presence of an intermediate phrase.
Anexample from the POS-tagged data exhibitingdiscontinous CP detection is presented inFigure 4.5 ConclusionIn this work we have presented apreliminary approach to a corpus-basedlexicon of CPs in Hindi based on projectingPOS tags across parallel English-Hindicorpora.
Since the approach involves minimallinguistic analysis, it is easily extendable toother languages which exhibit similar CPconstructs, provided the availability of a POSlexicon.Clearly, a number of problems will remainwith any such approach.
The limitiations ofthe parallel POS tagging is that certain kinds ofmaps may never be found (as in parallel CPs insource and target languages).
On the otherhand, some of our accuracies, we feel, wouldimprove considerably given a larger parallelcorpus and more refined use of a Hindilexicon.In addition to the handling of discontinuousCPs hinted at above, another aspect that wewould like to consider next is to tune some ofthe parameters of the parallel taggingalgorithm, such as specifically tuning thedistortion and fertility probabilities insituations (e.g.
English verbs) that are likely tomanifest CPs in Hindi.We feel that beyond the usefulness of thisinitial approach, the database of CPsconstructed in this work may in itself be animportant linguistic resource for Hindi.Furthermore, the approach can possibly beused to detect MWEs that radiate to a singlelexical structure in another language, e.g.phrasal verbs in English.Acknowledgements We acknowledge acomment from an anonymous reviewerregarding discontinuous CPs which led us toinvestigate them (Figure 4 above).
However, itwas not possible to report this importantexception for the entire database.34ReferencesEric Brill.1994.
