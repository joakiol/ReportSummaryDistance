This model is realized by usingfour typed plans which are categorized into threekinds of universal pragmatics and a ldnd of task-dependent knowledge related to common actionh ierarch ies .
The exper imenta l  sys tem ischaracter i zed  by h igher  modu lar i ty  andcomputational efficiency through defining ah ie rarch ica l  usage order  between theseknowledges.
The system can grasp a dialoguestructure making it possible to solve problemsrelated to spoken dialogue interpretation.1.
INTRODUCTIONAn efficient, and smooth communicat ionbe'~ween humans is generally realized in spokendialogues.
This fact is mainly supported byvarious el l ipsis exp:?essions concerning oldinformation, the dialogue participants, zero-pronouns - especially in dapanese, substitutionalverbs and so on.
Ass  result, each utterance isfragmental.
A sequence of these ut terancesgenerally construct a whole dialogue step bystep.
\['ragmental utterance comprehension by ahearer can be achieved using knowledge of thedialogue sitamtion, context intbrmation, domaindependent knowledge, especially the donmindependent  ac t ion  h ie rarchy \ [L i tman871,universal pragmatics concerning how to advancea dialogue, mainta in  dialogue cooperat ionbetween d ia logue par t i c ipants ,  etc.
,  andlanguage specific pragmatics \[Levinson831.
Suchellii;sis-resolution-is one of the main problems indiscourse understanding.
Several approacheswere proposed and implemented in \[fiendrix781,\ [Sh imazu79\ ] ,  \ [Carbonel1831,  etc.
Theseresearchers used various heuristic rules and didnot make a clear distinction between domain~pecific knowledge and pragmat ics .
As aconsequence,  the user  in ter face  becameinflexible because the system basically handledexpected utterance patterns.
*(1) :A discourse goal is characterized by a discourseexpectation which dialogue participants mutually believeas an expectation.
Therefore, a discourse goal is very vaguebecause a expectation depends on various attentions orempathies and the participant's knowledge,*(2) :Allowing embedded turn-takings.
*(3):A communicative act is basically defined as anabstract action, one that effects the bearer's thinking ordeci,qiommaking and which can be described by a planschema (cf.
Cohen84).Recent ly ,  a p lan -based  d ia logueunderstanding approach was developed using akind of pragmatics metaplan: a 'discourse plan'incorporated with domain knowledge, 'domainplan' \[Litnmn871.
This approach was based onAllen & Perrault's plan recognition strategies\[AllenS0\], \[PerraultS0\], [Allen871.
By way ofcontrast ,  a pragmat ic-based approach wasproposed in order to understand intersententialelliptical fragments \[Carberry891.
She claimedLitnmn's st rategies  could not recognize asurprise o rs  doubt conveyed by an ellipticalfragment, for example "$10,000 ":",.
which is not acomplete sentence including postulated speechacts 'request' or 'inform'.
In addition, she alsoc la imed that  metap lans  represent ingcommunicat ive goals should be dealt  withadequately.
She newly introduced 'discourseexpectat ion'  rules for grasping interact ionbetween an in fo rmat ion -seeker  and aninformation-provider and 'discourse goal' rulesfor ident i fy ing  an in fo rmat ion -seeker ' sconversational or communicat ive goa\[*(l).These rules are heuristics for interpreting anelliptical fragment which explicitly indicates nolinguistic clues to interpreting speech act.s.
Onthe other hand, in order to make the generalunderstanding mechanism clear, a surprise or adoubt fragment such as mentioned above, mustbe understood from recognizing an irregularmeaning from the view of gaps between commonsense (a certain prerequisite ondition) and thedeclarat ion.
Fur thermore ,  studying how toexpress a query, an answer, a confirmation, asurprise or a doubt in a context and a dialoguesituation is necessary.In considerat ion of mak ing  a d ia logueunders tand ing  model  inc lud ing  such anunderstanding process, a method to handlepragmaties and utterance or dialogue must bes tud ied .

lhe pragmat lcs  aredescribed by a 'dialogue plan', 'communicationplan' and 'interaction plan'.2.
THREE TYPED PRAGMATICSThree types of universal pragmat ies  (el.LevinsonS3) can be classified and described bythe following plans: Interaction-Plan - a planbasically eharaeter ized by a dialogue turn-taking*(2) which descr ibes  a sequence  ofcommunicative acts*(3), Communication-Plan -a plan which determines how to execute or370achieve an utterance goal or dialogue goals, andDialogued:qan : a plan for establ ishing adialogue construction, e.g.
a cooperativedialogue*(4).For example, in order to achieve the goal ofregistering for the conference tim followingsequer, ce must usually be performed (Domain-Plan}: obtain a registration form, fill out theform and return it to the secretariat.
In such atelephone dialo}'ue, if something is needed toexecute the gore action, a request o send it canbe made, or it wil l  be of fered to you(Co:mmunication-t) lan).
To complete thecooperative infbrnmtion-seeking, thehearer willresl)ond to the speaker's request*(5) (Interaction-Plan).
Beiorc building a whole dia loguestructure, the speaker should utter the openingsection of the dialogue, especial ly on thetelephone.
Furthermore when the dialogue isfinished, the speaker should wide up thedialogue (Dialogue-Plan).Each plan is described in terms of a schemaformulation (plan-schema).A plan-schema has various lots to describe bothan action's inner properties, e.g.
HEADER and41 r~ ,l ?
?
PI{LI) ICAIE&CASES, and re lat ionstt lpsbetween the act ion and prerequ is i testates/actions, effects, etc., e.g.
PREREQUISITE,DECOMPOSITIONS,  CONSTRAINTS,EFFECTS.A definite hierarchical order among theseplans is available as follows;Interaction-Plan > Communication-Plan >Domain-Plan > Dialogue-Plan.3.
DIALOGUE ANALYSISThere are several linguistic phenomenawhich are hard to interpret, such as ellipses,re fer r ing  pronouns and subst i tu t iona lexpressions.
Both in format ion  from theestablished context and expectations from thecurrent dialogue situation are required toresolve such problems.
In order to get theseinformation a dialogue structure which indicatesthe goal hierarchy of utterances in a dialoguemust be constructed.
A dialogue analysis isrequired and it is necessary todetermine ;(1) how to infer each goal of an utterancewithin a dialogue,(2) how to make clear the relationshipsbetween goals within the dialogue.For the first problem, a plan recognitioninference method is adequate for identifying anutterance intention because the intention can beinferred by recognizing the speaker's plan bychaining communicative acts regarded as speechacts in a specific domain \[Allen80), \[Perrault80\],\[Litman 87\].
For the second problem, the*(4) :A dialogue global construction usually has an openingsection and closing section.
I lere, such a linguisticphenotmnon is regarded as language-universal.
*(5) :On the other hand, in order to complete the cooperativeinteraction, when the speaker imparts information, thehearer will confirm what the speaker has said according tothe speaker's belief in the hearer's intention.
*(6) An active chart parser has been developed forJapanese dialogue analysis on a unification based grammar,which is based on IIPSG and JPSG \[Pollard88), \[Gunji87\],\[Kogure89\].
Furthermore, many discourse entities can beidentified by using NP Identification Method \[Nogaito88\].domain..specific, knowledge is related to theaction and objects, especial ly the act ionhierarchy which is used to grasp the utterance~ oal, and three kinds of pragmatics between unmns involved in a spoken dialogue are usedto grasp the dialogue development.3A Communicative ActsFirst, in order to recognize the speaker'splan, it is necessary torecognize the turn-takingpatterns.
Communicative acts \[Cohen84\] areint roduced .
In F ig .
l ,  an example  ofcommunicative acts in a cooperative task-oriented ialogue, e.g.
'queries and explanationsregarding registration for an internationalconference' is shown.A communicative act in the demand classand a corresponding act in the response classmake a turn-taking pair.
This is recognized bythe interaction plan.
A communicative act is adecomposition element of an interaction plan.Denmnd Class Response ClassAsk-value Inform-value"Whet, is the deadline?

"Eig.1 At) Example oi' Commurticative Acts3.2 Inference Mechanism'An utterance meaning is represented byillocutionary speech act types and propositionalcontents  obtained from a t lead-Dr ivenunification-based active chart parser*(6) forJapanese dialogues.
The parsing result  isdescribed by a feature structure and tim systeminput is modified into a communicative act withpropositional contents.
These consist of a certainpredicate, an 'utterance type', and somevariables, in particular, 'speaker', hearer', and'topic'.
'Topic' is, on a surface level, an NPmarked with the Japanese special particle, 'wa',or the compound particle 'nituite'.The plan recognizer (1) assumes a goal.
(2) Ifa particular goal cannot be found, then stop elsegoto next (3).
(3) Infer a chaining path from aninput to the goal.
If success, stop.
Else return tothe first process (1) in order to try to find the nextcandidate.
The chaining process between plansgenerally finds a candidate plan from thecurrent state (IIEADER) to an action listrepresented in I)ECOMPOSITtON.
Ilowever ifthis fails, the chaining will be continued inaccordance with PREREQUISITE and EFFECT.In order  to manage the cur rentunderstanding state, the system uses two slacks.UN1)ERSTANDING-IAST stores completedplans as the current understanding state, andGOAL-IAST mainta ins  incomplete plansregarded as possibilities and expectations for-2- 371fu ture  goals .
An overv iew of  a d ia loguestructure construction process is shown in Fig.2.4.
AN EXPERIMENTAL  SYSTEMThis analysis model is realized by using lout"typed plans which are categor ized into Ulreetypes of universal  pragmatics and a type o?
task-dependent knowledge related to common actionhierarchies.
The system has been implementedin Symbolics Common Lisp.
A dialogue structureis represented  by both completed p lans  andincomplete  p lans  s tored in the two stacks.Therefore,  the system can understand ialoguemeanings and can offer a dia logue s t ructureusing the contents of both stacks.
Four  modeldialogues regarding an internat ional  conferenceregistrat ion taken from slightly modified inter-keyboard  d ia logues  in Japanese  have beenapplied.
For example, the system can understanda Japanese substitutional expression,  e.g.
"O-isog-i kudasa i"  ( l i tera l  t rans la t ion  : 'Hur ryplease') which shows no agent, no object and noverb, because the current  topic which is focusedon an action in the domain plan is known in thesystem and the omitted verb (e.g.
'Return-Form')can be identified under the scope dominated bythe topic.5.
CONCLUSIONLitman & Allen introduced a set of discourseplans, each one corresponding to a par t i cu la rway that an utterance can relate to a discoursetopic.
They dist inguish discourse plans from aset of domain plans.
The dia logue s t ructureanalysis model basically follows the above ideaand  uses  new three  typed pragmat ics :in teract ion  p lan,  communicat ion  p lan  anddialogue plan.
By introducing these plans, themech~mism for construct ing a dialogue structurebecomes - c lear  because of the way a sur faceutterance is connected with both pragmatics andthe domain-specif ic knowledge, and by reducingthe search space using a hierarchical  order  ofapplying knowledge, computat ional  efficiency isimproved.AcknowledgementThe authors  would  l ike  to thank  ThePres ident  Dr. Akira Kurematsu  and our otherco l leagues  at  ATR In terpret ing  Te lephonyResearch Laborator ies for their  encouragementand thought-provoking discussions.REFERENCES\[Allen 801 Allen, J.
