Comunica.tions servicesare the means by which scientists and engineers are able tob u i l d  upon the results of p r i o r  work even though that work mayhave been done at a distant place or in a different discipline.Many prestigious committees and study groups have analyzed theinformation problems of scientists and engineers and offered abroad range of recommendations for improvement.
But very littlehas changed.
This symposium will review the problems with, andneeds for, co~unications services by the scientific communityand suggest new approaches to the problem of maintaining an eco-nomically viable and user responsive scientific and technicalcomunications enterprise in the U.S.
Speakers will deal witha variety of specific questions including: What is the role ofinformation in science and engineering?
How much progress havew e  made in improving information services during the last 10years?
What are the current problems in financial support, or-ganization, and management of the scientific communication enter-prise?
What can be done to improve the extisting situation andenhance the value of scientific and technical information ser-vices to users engaged in scientific research?ARRANGED BY RUTH M. DAVIS ,  DIRECTOR,  INSTITUTE F O R  COMPUTERSCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY, NATIONAL BUREAU O F  STANDARDS, ANDJOEL 0.

HOEMANNBowling Green S t a t e  UniversityOhio 43403Stokoe (1960) has des igned  a model of the structure of theAmerican Sign Language (ASL) which is amenable to computer si-mulation.
He has proposed that signs comprising the ASL lexi-con are composed of three basic aspects, location (TAB), handconfiguration I (DEZ) , and movement (SIG) .
He has identified afinite number of each of these elements, and he has proposedthat they may be combined in various ways to constitute recog-nizable and meaningful signs.
Recent reformulations have ven-t u r ed  some modifications ( e .
g .
,  Stokoe, 1972), but the basicapproach remains the same.Such a conceptualization of ASL implies that if a computer werefurnished a set of each of these types of elements, it ought  toAcknowledgments.

Our principal apparatus was an Owens-IllinoisDigivue Plasma Display Unit attached to a Nova 1220 minicomputerThe Digivue Display Unit is an electronic device with a gas-filled display matrix and activating circuitry.
An electr icalsignal is passed through each of two very f i n e  wires at rightangles to one another .
When the gas is activated, it lights upat the poiat of intersection.
There a r e  512 g r i d  lines in eachd i r e c t i o n ,  making a t o t a l  of 262,144 addressable points.
Pointscan be written or erased at the rate of 50,000 dots p e r  second.The program language used was Graphic Basic, a version of DataGeneral Corporation's time-shared BASIC, modified for use wi ththe Digivue Display Unit (Fulton, 1974).
Access to the computerwas gained through the Digivue keyboard and through a teletype-writer.
Paper tape output from the teletypewriter providedpermanent storage of previously written programs.PROCEDURE.
AS a concession to storage limitations, t h e  p ro j ec twas, a t  f i r s t ,  limited to one-handed signs located on or nearthe face.
An oval shape with stylized browline, nose, andmouth was stored in memory and served as the reference for anysign which the computer was r e q u i r e d  to generateHand c o ~ ~ f i g u r a t i o n s  (DEZ) were constructed by jo in ing  coordinatep o i n t s  with line segments.
The points were s t o r e d  in t h e  memoryof t h e  computer, and g r a p h i c  commands were i s sued  t o  form t h el i n e  segments.As a program was f ed  i n t o  the  computer, it s t o r e d  in memory in-formation about t h e  DEZ and t h e  initial TAB while t h e  face wasdrawn on the  screen.
Another series of subroutines drew theDEZ in its initial TAB and moved it to another TAB so as t o  re-present a movement (SIG).
I f  the sign required a change of DEZ,the program could call the new DEZ up from memory and place itin the sign's final p o s i t i o n .VALIDATION.
The adequacy of the simulated signs rests witht h e i r  intelligibility.
Deaf and hearing persons who were fluentusers of ASL were t e s t e d  to verify that the  graphic  displayy i e l d e d  signs t h a t  could be recognized as par t  of t h e  ASL lex icon.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThus far 11 DEZ, 8 TABs, and 7 SIGs have been programed ands t o r e d  on a single paper tape.
I f  d i s c  storage and the necessaryinterface were added to our  Nova, it is likely t h a t  we couldrepresent all 12 TABs, 19 DEZ, and 24 SIGs identified by Stokoeas primes  of his model.
Meanwhile, the subset of structuralfeatures programed thus f a r  constitute a suitable feasibilitystudy of a computer simulation of ASL.
The following resultshave been achievedIt has been ver i f ied  that t h e  features of ASL identified byStokoe as structural elements may also function as distinctivefeatures.
The same DES and SIG executed with different TABsmay result in signs with d i f f e r e n t  meanings ( f a t h e r  and mother,s u m m e r  and d r y  in our data).
The same TAB and SIG executed withd i f f e r e n t  DEZ may a l so  result in signs with different meanings(who and lipread in our data).
Finally, the same DEZ and TABwith di f fe ren t  SIGs may a l s o  result in signs with d i f f e ren tmeanings (summer and w i s e ,  face and who in our data) .Secondly ,  i f  any one of these aspects (TAB, DEZ, or SIG) of asign is altered, the resulting sign compiled by the computer is1) likely to be nonsense" in ASL.
In our data, the 11 DEZ,  8TABs, and 7 SIGs yield potentially 11 x 8 x 7 or 616 signs.Over 600 of them are nonsense.
This indicates that most signsin ASL differ from one a n o t h e r  i n  more than one distinctive fea-ture.
Also, since many signs change DEZ and involve more thanone SIG, there is a low probability of confusing one sign withanother, even when the signs are presented out of con tex t .Finally, our data indicate that the orientation of the handsa l so  constitutes a distinctive feature i n  ASL.
Inappropriatehand orientation can disrupt intelligibility even when the o the rthree aspects are compiled correctly.
Stokoe's model seems tobe sufficiently robust t o  assimilate t h e  required revision with-out altering h i s  basic approach.This computer simulation of ASL was l i m i t e d  t o  t he  structuralfeatures o f  individual s i g n s ,  and it corresponds t o  a study ofthe  phonological structure of spoken languages.

rfIse of .Th i :-; i n : ;e d  "I In t roduc t ionIn t h i s  paper we describe a new programming language which is designedto facilitate the writing of natural language grammars.
A s i m p l e  structuralanalysis program using this language is given as an example.
There are twokey issues in analyzing natural language by computer: 1) how to representknowledge (semantics, pragmatics) and t h e  state (context) of the  world, and2) how to advance the programming technology appropriate for syntactic-semantic, syntactic-contextual interface.
The point in designing a programminglanguage is  to make this kind of programming less painful.T r a d i  t i m a 1  systems whi.ch r e p r e s e n t  grammars as  a set  of rewrit ingrules ust ia l ly  'have poor c o n t r o l  mechanisms, and flexible in teract ion  betweenthc syntac t  LC and other con~ponents is not  possible.

I t  i s  p o s s i b l e  t o  impose various types of semant ic  and pragmat icc o n d i t i o n s  on the branches  between s ta tes .
By doing  this, c l o s e  i n t e r a c t i o n sbetween the s y n t a c t i c  and other components can be  e a s i l y  accomplished.However ATN h a s  the f o l l o w i n g  shor tcomings ,  e s p e c i a l l y  when we a p p l yi t  to the p a r s i n g  of Japanese s e n t e n c e s :1.

An ATN model e s s e n t i a l l y  performs a k ind  of top-down analysls ofs e n t e n c e s .
Therefore  recovery f ronl f a i l u r e s  in predic t f .on  is most d1.f f i c u l t .Consider ing these fac tors ,  w e  d e v e l o p e d  PLATON (a ProgrammingLhnguage f o r  Tree-Ol>cratioN), which is based  on the A1'N model and has v a r i o u sa d d i t i o n a l  c a p a b i l i t i e s  such as pattern-matching, f l e x i b l e  back t rack ing ,  andso  on.
As in S y s t e w Q  and LINGOL, PLATON's pat tern-matching fac i l i ty  makesi t  e a s y  to write rewriting r u l e s .
Moreover, i t  extracts s u b s t r u c t u r e s  fromthe i n p u t s  and invokes a p p r o p r i a t e  semant ic  and  c o n t e x t u a l  checking func t ions .31These may be arbitrary LISP functions def ined  by t h e  user, the arguments ofw h i ~ n  are the  extracted substructures.A backtracking mechanism is a l so  necessary for l a n g u ~ e  understandingas in other fields of a r t i f i c i a l  intelligence.
During t h e  analysis, varioussorts of h e u r i s t i c  information should be u t i l i z a b l e .
A t  any s tage ,  analysisbased on criteria which may re la te  t o  syntactic, semantic or contextualconsiderat ions taken separately may be unre l iable .
The result which f u l f i l sall the criteria, however, w i l l  b e  a correct one.
The program shou ld  b edesigned such  that i t  can choose the most satisfactory rule from manycand ida te s  according t o  the criteria at hand.
In further processing, i f  thechoice i s  found to  b e  wrong by other criteria, the  program must be able tobacktrack to  the p o i n t  at which the .relevant decision w a s  made.
In PLATONwe can e a s i l y  set  up arbitrary numbers of dec i s ion  po int s  in t h e  program.Then, i f  subsequent processing resu l t s  i n  some failure, control w i l l  comeback t o  the points relevant t o  the cause of the f a i l u r e .11.
Pattern-matchingBefore proceeding to  the detailed description of  PLATON, w e  w i l lexplain the  r e p r e s e n t a t i o n  schema for i n p u t  sentences and parsed trees.
Theprocess of analyzing a sentence, roughly speaking, may be regarded as theprocess of transforming an ordered list of words t o  a tree s tructure ,  whichshows e x p l i c i t l y  the interrelationships of each word in the input  sentence.During the process, trees which correspond to the parts already analyzed, and1 h t s  which have not been processed y e t ,  may c o e x i s t  together i n  a s i n g l es tructure .
We therefore wish to represent such a coexisting structure o ftrees and lists.
A l ist  structure is a s tructure  i n  which the order of elementi s  not changeable.
On the other hand, a tree structure cons i s t s  of a singleroot node and several nodes which are tied t o  the root node by d i s t inguishablere lat ions .
Because relations between the root and the  other nodes aree x p l i c i t l y  spec i f ied ,  t he  order  of nodes in a tree is changeable except forthe root node which is placed in the leftmost posit ion.
Different matchingschemas w i l l  be a p p l i e d  to  trees and lists.The formal definition of such coexisting structures is as f o l l o w s .<structure> i s  the fundamental data-structure into which a l l  data processedby PLATON must be transformed.
Hereafter we refer to  this  as the "structure"The formal definition of <structure) is:(list) ::= ($ ts tructures> )(structures> : := 1 <structure> ( structures ><tree> : := ( node, I ( (node) < branches) )<branches> : := (brancl~) 1 (branch, branches )(branch) ::= ( < r e l a t i o n >  (tree, )( node, : := C l i s  t > I !UBITRARY LISP-ATOM< relation > : := ARBITRARY LISP-ATOMA simple example is shown in Figure 1.Coexisting Structure ofTrees and ListsCorresponding Expressioni n  PLATONFigure 1 Expression of Structure i n  PLATONTwo lists which have the same elements but dif ferent  orderings (for example,( X  A B C) and ($ A C B)) , should be regarded as different structures.
Onthe other hand, two tree structures such  as ( A ( R1 B ) ( R2 C ) )  and( A ( R2 C ) (  R1 B ) )  are regarded as i d e n t i c a l .
Besides the usual rewriterules which treat such s tr ings ,  s tructural patterns  which contain variableexpressions are permitted in PLATON.
The PLATON-interpreter matchesstructural patterns containing variable expressions against the structureunder process and  checks whether the s p e c i f i e d  p a t t e r n  is found in it.
Atthe same time, the variables in the pattern are bound t o  the correspondingsubs tructurzs .Variables  i n  patterns are indicated as :X (X i s  an arbitrary LISPatom).
The following can be expressed by variables in the above definition(1) arbitrary numbers of < structures> , that i s  to say, l i s t  elements inthe definition of < list > (Figure  2, Ex.
1).
We can also specify theStructural Pat terns Structures Resul ts  o f  MatchingExample 1SUCCESSI n  A :KC CExample 2SUCCESSSUCCESSFigure 2 Illustration of Matching3 4number of l ist  elements by i n d i c a t i n g  variables as :X+number.

By using the samevariable several times i n  a p a t t e r n ,  we can express a structure i n  which  t hesame sub-structure appears i n  two o r  more different places.

is represen ted  as ad i r e c t e d  graph with labeled states  and branches.
There is one state d i s  tin-guished as the Start State  and a s e t  of sta tes  called F i n a l  States.
Eachbranch is a rewriting r u l e  and has the fol lowing elements:(1) applicability condi t ions  of t h e  rule, typical ly  represen ted  asa  structural p a t t e r n(2)  a c t i o n s  which must be executed, i f  the r u l e  is a p p l i c a b l e(3) a s t r u c t u r a l  pa t tern  i n t o  which the i n p u t  s t r u c t u r e  should  bet ransformed.Each s ta te  has  several branches ordered according t o  the preference  of thorules.
When the control jumps to  a state ,  i t  checks t h e  rules associatedwith the state  one-by-one until it finds an appl i cab le  rule.
If such a ruleis found, the i n p u t  s t r u c t u r e  is transformed i n t o  another  s t r u c t u r e  s p e c i f i e dby t h e  r u l e  and the control makes the s t a t e  t r a n s i t i o n .35In addit ion to  the above basic mechanism t h e  system i s  provided withpush-down and pop-up operations.
The push-down operat ion  is such that i n  t h eprocess of a p p l y i n g  a rule ,  several substructures  are extracted from thewhole s t r u c t u r e  by v a r i a b l e  binding mechanisms of pattern-matching.
Then eachi s  analyzed from a dif ferent  state.

Aru l e  i n  PLATON f i n d s  particular s y n t a c t i c  c lues  by i ts  s t r u c t u r a l  desc r ip t ion( strx> ; and a t  the same time, extracts  substructures from the inputst'king From the structural description i t  i s  predicted that the substructuresmay have particular constructions, that is ,  t h e y  may comprise noun phrases,relative clauses or whatever.
It is-necessary to transfer the subst~r~cturest o  s t a t e s  appropriate f o r  analyzing these constructions predicted and to returnthe analyzed structures back into the appropriate places In PLATON, theseoperations can be described in the Ctrans > -part o f  a rule.
For example,suppose the <trans >-part of a rule is( ( (  Sl :K :K ) )  ( (  S2 ( :I : J ) / R E G  ) )  )When the cantrol interprets t h i s  statement, the substructures correspondingto  the v a r u b l e  :K and ( :I : J ) are transferred t o  the s t a t e s  S1 and S 2respectively If the process ings  starting from these s t a t e s  are normallycompleted (by a POP-type r u l e ) ,  then the resu l t s  are stored i?
the variable:K and the regzster /REG.
In this manner, by means of the push-down andpop-up mechanisms, substructures can be analyzed from appropriate states.Processing from kese s t a t e s ,  however, may sometimes result in failure,That is ,  predictions that certain relationships w i l l  be  found among theelements of  substructures may not be f u l f i l l e d .
In such instances the pusheddown state  w i l l  send an error-message appropriate t o  the cause of the failureby an W t y p e  rule.
An FM-type rule points o u t  that a certain error hasoccurred in the processing.
If NEXTB-type rules were used i n  the previousprocessing a t  this l e v e l ,  control w i l l  go back to  the most recently usedNEXTB-type r u l e .
If NEXTB-type rules were not used at this  processing leve l ,tne error-message specif ied by the FM-type rule w i l l  be sent t o  the <trans>part of the rule which directed this push-down operation ( see  Figure 4)Higher levelLower level pprocessing-------------// \/ \I \/ \r o c e s s i n g ~  \---I -I\I\ i\/ NExTB-type rules werenot a p p l i e d  in this l eve lLower level processingc--------/This r u l e  will be applied n e x t .Figure 4 Illustration of Backtracking43According t o  these error-messages, control-flow can be changedappropriately.
For example, w e  can direct  processings by describing the4 trans > -part i n  the following way.
( ( (  s l  :K :K ) (  ERR1 ( EXEC ( (  S5 :K :K 1) (( 56 ( :I :J ) /REG ) ) ) )( ERR2 ( T U N S  ( S8 / ) ) I( ( S 2  (j6 : I  :J ) /REG ) )  )I n  t h e  above example, the processing of the substructure :K from the s t a t eS1 will produce one of the  fo l lowing  three results .
According to thereturned value, the appropriate  step w i l l  b e  taken:(1) Normal return: the processing of :K is ended by a POP-typerule.
The resul t  i s  s t o r e d  i n  the variable  :K and the n e x t  push-downperformed, that i s  : I  : J ) w i l l  be  transferred t o  the state S2.
(2) Return w i t h  an error-message: t h e  processing of :K results ina f a i l u r e  and an FM-type r u l e  sends up an error-message.
If the  message isERR1, them :K and :f :J ) w i l l  b e  analyzed from the states S5 and S6respectively (EXEC-type).
If i t  is  ERRS, the interpreter  w i l l  give up theapplication o f  the present  rule, and pass the control to another state  S8(TRANS- type) .
If it is neither ERRl nor ERR2, the  same s t e p  as (3) w i l l  betaken(3)  Re turn w i t h  the value NIL: the processing Prom t h e  state S1w i l l  send up the value NIL if it runs into a blind alley, that is, there are noappl icable  r u l e s .
The interpreter w i l l  give up the a p p l i c a t i o n  of the presentrule and proceed to the next rule attached t o  th is  state .Mechanisms, such that control flow can be appropriately changedaccording to the error-messages from lower level processings are n o t  found inWoods ATN parser, We can obtain flexible backtracking f a c i l i t i e s  by combiningthese mechanisms wi th  NEXTB- type rules.V A Simple  ExampleWe are now developing a deduc t ive  question-answering sys tern withn a t u r a l  language i n p u t s  -- Japanese  sentences.
The i n t e r n a l  data-base isassumed t o  be a set  o f  deep case s t r u c t u r e s  o f  i n p u t  sen tences .
We a d o p t e dand m o d i f i e d  Fillmore's (1968) case grammar t o  analyze the i n p u t  of Japanesesen tences .
Japanese is  a t y p i c a l  example o f a n  SOV-language i n  which t h eo b j e c t  and o t h e r  c o n s t i t u e n t s  governed by a verb usually appear before  :heverb i n  s sentence.
A typical c o n s t r u c t i o n  of a Japanese sentence is  shownin Figure  5.Figure 5 T y p i c a l  Construction of aJapanese SentenceA verb may govern several noun phrases preceding it.
A relative clausemodifying a noun may appear  i n  t he  form -- verD + noun -- The r i g h tboundary of t h e  clause is easily identified by f i n d i n g  the verb.
The leftboundary i s  o f t e n  much more d i f f i c u l t  t o  i d e n t i f y .
I n  Figure  5, t h e  nounphrase N P k r  is a c a s e  element of t he  verb V On the o t h e r  hand, t h e  nounphrase NPi is governed by the  verb Va Because the  r u l e  of p r o j e c t i o n s  holdsi n  JaFnese as i n  o t h e r  languages, a l l  the noun phrases between NP c'+ I andV are governed by V , and the noun phrases b e f o r e  NP,: are governed by VAHowever, i n  the cou.rse of a n a l y s i s ,  such boundaries cannot be determineduniquely.
The analysis program fixes a temporary boundary and proceeds t othe next s t e p  i n  process ing I f  the temporary boundary is not correct,  thesucceeding processing w i l l  f a i l  and the con t ro l  w i l  come back to t he  po in ta t  which the temporary boundary was fixed.Now we w i l l  show a simple example of structural ana lys i s  by PLATONThe example explains how the backtracking f a c i l i t y  is  used i n  analyzingJapanese sentences.
Because we want t o  v i sua l i ze  t h e  operations of PLATONw i t h o u t  bo the r ing  w i t h  microscopic d e t a i l s  of Japanese sentences, we w i l ltake an imaginary problem as an example.
The parser which is written inPLATON is described in another paper by M Nagao and J. T s u j i i  (1976)An input s t r i n g  is assumed to be a l i s t .
The elements of the  listare in tegers  and trees are i n  the form of ( X (SUM 0)).
Here 'X' may beregarded as a term modif ied  by 'SUM 0' These two kinds of elements arearranged i n  an arbitrary order, except that the last element i s  the tree(X(SUM 0)).
The following is an example of an  i n p u t  s t r i n g :( 5 2 1 3  (x ( S r n  0)) 3 1 (X (SUM 0)) 2 2 ( x (SUM 0)) )Figure 6 An Example String t o  be AnalyzedThe result of the transformation is  expected to be i n  the following fotm:( ( X  (Sm4)) (XSm6)) (X (Sm9)) 1This result is regarded as representing the following relationships betweenintegers and 'X' .The number associated with  an 'X' by the relation 'SUM' shows the sum ofthe integers which are governed by the X .
We can look upon the relationsr between integers and an X' as the re la t ions  between noun phrases and the verbi n  Japanese sentences.
The resul t  of the analysis  is assumed to satisfythe following conditions.46(1) Governor-governed re la t ionsh ips  between in tegers  and an 'X' must obeythe project ion rule (i.e., clauses  do not  over lap) .

By applying t h e  f irst  ruleof t h i s  s t a t e  repeatedly on the above structure the fol lowing structure isobtained.
(j( ( x SUM 4 ) )  150However this result does not s a t i s f y  the  con textual restriction.So the application of t h e  second ru le  of SLJMl.JP f a i l s  because the  funct ionCONTEXTCHECK used i n  <con ) -part returns  the value NIL (SUMUP -2-, con)That is :con textcheck [(  (X (SUM 6 )  ) (X (SUM 9) ) ) : (X ( S U M  4 ) )  1 = N I LThe third rule, therefore, w i l l  be  a p p l i e d  next.
Because t h i s  rule is a%type r u l e  ( S U M U P  -3-, end) ,  it causes  an error and c o n t r o l  comes back t othe  point at which a NEXTB-type r u l e  w a s  appl i ed  most recently.
The savednv iro~ment  is restored.
This is:/REG: = ( 5 3 1 )/RESULT: = ( (X (SUM 6 ) )  )s t r u c t u r e  under processing: = (* (X (SUM 9) )  2 2 (X (SUM 0)) )Then by applying the second rule of BACKTRACK, the governor-governedr e l a t i o n s h i p  e s t a b l i s h e d  l a s t l y  in the previous process  i s  c a n c e l l e d .
Thes t r u c t u r e  and the  r e g i s t e r  /REG are changed as below (BACKTRACK -2-, act) :/REG: = ( 3 1 )structure  under process ing:  ( 5 ( X  (SUM 4)) 2 2 (X (SUM 0 ) )  )Control enters the  BACKTRACK state again.
The application of thefirst r u l e  saves the e n v i r o n ~ w n t  :content of /REG = ( 3 1 )content of /RESULT = ( (X (SUM 6 ) )s tructure  under processing = (1< 5 ( X (SUM 4)) 2 2 (X (SUM 0 ) )  )That is,  the  r e l a t i o n s h i p  indicated by t h e  dotted l i n e  i n  the fol lowing iscance l l ed:Control t r a n s i t s  t o  t h e  s t a t e  SUMUP (BACKTRACK -I-, end) and asimilar process i s  performed.
However, because the governor-governedrelationship between t h e  i n t e g e r  5 and t h e  second 'Xr i s  c a n c e l l e d ,  t h e  sumof the i n t e g e r s  governed by the  f i r s t  'X', ( 2 1 3 ) ,  i s  g r e a t e r  than t h a tof the second ' X' , ( 3 1 ) .
The contextual cond i t i on ,  t h e r e f o r e ,  is  no tfulfilled, and the a p p l i c a t i o n  of the second r u l e  of SUMUP will n o t  succeed.So the t emporar i ly  established relationships w i l l  be c a n c e l l e d  one-by-one asfollows.After  these r e l a t i o n s h i p s  have been cance l l ed ,  the desired r e s u l t  is  obta inedby the f o l l owing  sequence.52A t  t h e  final stage of the  processing, the  f o u r t h  r u l e  of S W  aPOP-type r u l e ,  i s  a p p l i e d  and r e t u r n s  the  value( (X (SUM 4 ) )  CX (SUM 6)) (X  (SUM 9) 1V I  ConclusionWe have described a programming language c a l l e d  PLATON f o r  n a t u r a llanguage processing.
The language has s e v e r a l  a d d i t i o n a l  capabilities beyondthe ATN parser of W. Woods.Grammars written i n  t h e  language n o t  only maintain c l a r i t y  ofrepresentation but a l s o  provide adequately a n a t u r a l  i n t e r f a c e  between thes y n t a c t i c  component and o t h e r  components.
By means of t h e  pa t te rn-matchingfacility, w e  can write grammars i n  a quite n a t u r a l  manner.
And because ofthe  PLATON v a r i a b l e  b inding mechanism, semantic and con tex tua l  LISP f u a c t i o n sa e a s i l y  incorpora ted  i n  s y n t a c t i c  patterns.Flex ib l e  backtracking mechanisms and push-down opera t ions  make com- ,r, Acatecr non-de te rmin i s t i c  processing possible i n  a very simple way.We a r e  now deveLoping an analysis program f o r  Japanese using t h i slanguage.
The program can accept  f a i r l y  complicated s e n t e n c e s  i n  a textbookof elementary chemistry It can u t i l i z e  t h e  lexical and contextual  informationof chemistry adequately during the  analysis.
Such in format ion  i n  our systemis expressed i n  the form of a semantic network s i m i l a r  t o  that of R. F. Simmons(1973 ) .Perhaps,  PLATON i t s e l f  must be e q u i p p e d  w i t h  more semantics andcontext-oriented o p e r a t i o n s  such as specified lexical d e s c r i p t i o n s  and funct ionsus ing  them.
However, what desc r ip t ion  method is most efficient, and moreover,what semantic information must be stored i n  the lexicon, a r e  not y e t  entirelyclear.
So, as the f i r s t  s t e p ,  PLATON leaves many p a r t s  of these  problems f o r53the user t o  spec i fy  by LISP programs.
PLAMN is written in LIS1'1.5 andimplemented on a FACOM 230-60 a t  the Kyoto University computing center and aTOSBAC-40 mini-computer in our laboratory.

A d i r e c t o r y  ofmembers also appeared.Early in 1975, the Journal announced an experimental procedurefor review of submiesions; the author could submit a 600-wordsummary f o r  distribution t o  a l l  members of the  E d i t o r i a lBoard, ?If the  l a s t  30 submissions, 1 5  have used this proce-dure.

Anent the decision as to whereto go from here, I have a very strong recommendation to make.
Ithink you're in a pioneering position on something very important,and should stick with it, certainly for at least two o r  threemore years if at a l l  possible.
The major difficulty and sourceof o b j e c t i o n s ,  I think, is not any of the arguments againstmicrofiche that you outline, but simply the difficulty peoplehave in adopting radical ly  new habits in such a fundamental ac-t i v i t y  as reading.Which Srings me to the second point.
I think that a s  a pioneer,the E d i t o r i a l  Board of the  AJCL has a responsibility to try tomake the experiment- succeed, and not  just sit back and watch.Specifically, I think it's v e r y  important to make available tosubscribers a microfiche reader which works reasonably well, isnot t e r r i b l y  expensive, and most importantly, is easy to acquire.I would bet  that if you arranged with a manufacturer or dealerto supply a small, practical reader in the $25-$35 price range,which people could order  simply by writing their name and addresson an addressed, postage-paid return card included in an M C Lpacket, at l ea s t  a hundred would be sold within a month Youwbuld have done your readers a service, and would alsb havebroadened the base of those who are in a position to make use ofthe micro?
iche format.There are a var ie ty  of d e t a i l s  t o - b e  considered in implementingsuch a plan, for instance, that .
the supplier should be preparedt o  make exchanges f o r  defective units, but I ' m  sure that themembers of the Editorial Board are  as a l e r t  to these as I am.
Iwould appreciate hearing what reaction people have to thissuggestion.Paul G. ChapinNational Science FoundatioaWashington, D.C. 20550I am quite pleased  at receiving the AJCL on microfiche and wouldhope that other organizations to which I belong would at leastoffe r  optional microfiche subscriptions to their journals.
Ifind myself inundated w i t h  prfnted publications and am runningout of space to store these valuable documents; I do not want myof f i ce  or my home turned into a library.When I receive a copy of the AJCL, I read through the opaquecards looking for paper summaries that interest me.
When I f i n dsuch a paper, I use the department's microfiche reader to browsethrough it.
Occasionally I have the l ibrary  make a paper copyfor me so that I can study papers without access to a microficheviewer.One service which I think might be useful for ATCL subscriberswithout such convenient access to hard-copy microfiche machineswould be an opaque card which one could use to order paper copiesof selected articles.James R. RhyneDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity o f  Houston, Texas 77004The microfiche journal i s  the b e s t  thing ACL has g o t  going f o rit.
In che las t  couple of years, I've been letting my member-s h i p s  in a number of organizations lapse.
One of the p r i n c i p a lreasons is that I simply can't cope with the f l o o d  of paperwhich results from memberships.
My house and o f f i c e  get c l u t -tered up with stacks of magazines that can't be chucked becauseone article in a dozen looks as if it ought t o  be read some time.It's gotten to the point where new issues go straight from themailbox t o  the recyclery.
For this "servfce", one pays extra.Microfiche solves that;  I 've  got two years' worth of ACL outputin a 6" x 6%'' metal box, and there's room far two  more years.If I ever run out of room for metal boxes, I can cull out se-lected cards.1 1  By a l l  means, make your experiment" permanent!AnonymousMore notes on your questionnaire!
(1) I have been getting IEEE Computer, IEEE Computer Transactions,and IEEE Spectrum since 1969 on microfiche.
I no longer havepaper copies of these earlier issues.
I bought a cheap micro-f i c h e  reader in 1969.
(2) I bought a Realist (Xerox 320) l.fi .rears ago.
(3 )  1 also g e t  now AJCL Journal (yours), Scientific American(Bell & Howell) , IEEE Software Engineering regularly on micro-fiche.
( 4 )  I buy selected t i t l e s  from NTIS and University Microfj-Lms(Micromedia--kids books) .
1 subscribe to NTIS computer xeeklyabstracts @$3O/yr.
No company reimbursement.
(5) After a years research I have produced my f i r s t  amateurmicrofiche at home which dops on a Bruning.
(So I now will bea publisher!
)(6) I am a microfilm/microEiche COM expert in Management Systemsa t  work (only part t ime) .
I am a systems analyst on data centermanagement software .
(7) Being an engineer and an analyst AJCL is currently a peri-pheral area of interest.
I would not have joined your organi-zation if your journal was only on paper.
I got into microfilmingbecause I was running out of space.
(8) I believe I will be able to keep a tremendously large numbero f  journals, magazines, professional or pleasure reading books ifthey are on microfiche.
By keeping good inventories in a safe tydeposit  box I will have good insurance and replacement in case off i r e .49) Able t o  m i c r o f i l m  (fiche) myself I will be able t o  archive(and back u p  against f i r e )  any book or paper I work on.
It wouldbe easier to correspond and exchange papers with someone aroundthe world or U.S. Lower postage.
(10) I would like to see a l l  hard bound and paper back books,all magazines available on microfiche.
The savings for theLibrary of Congress and copyright o f f  ice would be tremendous.These fiche should also  be available to individuals from t hepublishers.
(11) I also get the ACM Communications, and ACM Surveys on f i cheI trust I will see the results  of your survey, and maybe my let-t e r ,  in the next AJCL Newsletter.Neil R. Karl21425 Duns ScotusSauthfield, Michigan 48075Your recent questionnaire on the AJCL format invited additionalcomment I may be biased but I think micropublication of ourjournal is a superb answer t o  t h e  twin problems of skyrocketingpublication/distribution costs  and the need to disseminate moreinformation to students of this growing field.No serious student or scholar should be without a microf ichereader.
Good compact readers from $100 (the Bell & HowellBrief CaS e reader) to $214 (the Washington Scientific IndustriesMini-Cat) are available.
Surely a modest investment for alife-time of use.I do think, however, that you can more effectively package themicrofiche for increased user convenience.
There are two basicapproaches: 1) Bind f i c h e  envelopes and the eye-legible cardstogether before they are distributed to subscribers or 2) providesubscribers with a conyenient microfiche binder file.Thomas F .
Deahl, Microdoc8 I 5 P a r n o n t ~ r  T.ane Phi Iarlelnhia 19119" - H I  r --- -.a ----- I - -------- r---- - - - - -It is my opinion that far from being a disadvantage, microficheis a positive advantage.
Already a large amount of my home andoffice space is devoted to storing technical journals which Ihave saved over the years, and as time passes t h e  problem willonly get worse.
I only hope that you will continue to distributeAJCL on fiche, and that other journals will follow your example.I do,  h o w e v e r , f i n d  the  small s i z e  of the opaque cards to be in-convenient.
Perhaps you could combine a l l  the opaque cards ineach issue i n t o  one or two 85x11" sheets, which could be fo ldedwhen m a i l e d ,  then spread open and c o l l e c t e d  in a looseleaf orother book when received.Norman Haas35-20 Leverich St ree tJackson Heights, N .Y.
11372While having the freedom to publish very d e t a i l e d  accounts ofl a r g e  programs is useful I think that a more space consciousmedium would encourage more concise descriptions.
The freedom tobe verbose does not strike me as a good idea  in t h i s  f i e l d !Also, it is difficult to judge the effect  of the microfiche formaton soliciting manuscripts because the journal is new and thus hasno developed prestige.UnsignedAlthough I do not object to microfiche format, I f i n d  the orga-nization of opaque cards and f i c h e  sometimes confusing and eas i l ydisordered .UnsignedI ' d  like to see ACL offer--at a good price--a fiche reader.My intuitive requirements are 1) "book-page" size image, 2) stow-a b l e ,  3) transportable, 4 )  under $100.

iche , 2) arrange to sell inexpensive readers to subscribersthrough ACL (or widely publ ic ize  where and for how much readersare available) 3)  offer hard copy versions of articles by indi-vidual order.UnsignedI am a computer programer by profession and my interest in lin-guis tics extends only to those areas which are directly applica-ble to computers.
Even there my interest is more concerned w i t hthe practical  s ide  rather than with  esoteric theory.
Since mostof what you print can only be considered a s  future referent mate-r ia l  by m e ,  your printing o f  the journal on microfiche is eminentlysatisfying to me; in fact ,  if you switched entirely to paper, Iwould have to seriously consider my continued receiving of thej ournal .Robert D. Kluto2179 Pacific AvenueSan Francisco, California 94115SHORT COMMENTSGeneralFiche is good for scanning and storing info where only occasionalreference is needed.
Paper copy needd  for the few papers offrequently needed reference.It didn't even reach me until Jan. 5. probably due to a poorlyregistered address label.
(I bet il l o t  don't make it if they'reall a s  bad as mine.
)I am a student and could not afford AJCL publications in  p r i n t e dform.You might make the microfiche envelope larger (to contain theopaque copy) and use face of envelope to print information on itYou should  have asked how long I was a member to interpret t h i sstuff.Sorry this is late One of my major reasons f o r  subscribing toAJCL is tha t  it is published in microfiche.For $10 a year I am very satisfied.
