jpAbst rac tWe exploit and extend the Generative Lexicon The-ory to develop a formal description of adnominalconstituents in a lexicon which can deal with linguis-tic phenomena found in Japanese adnominal con-stituents.
We classify the problematic behavior into"static disambiguation" and "dynamic disambigua-tion" tasks.
Static disambiguation can be done usinglexical information i a dictionary, whereas dynamicdisambiguation requires inferences at the knowledgerepresentation level.1 In t roduct ionNatural anguage processing must disambiguate pol-ysemous constituents in the input sentences.
A gooddescription of information ecessary for disambigua-tion in the lexicon is crucial in high quality NLP sys-tems.
This paper discusses the treatment of linguis-tic phenomena in Japanese adnominM constituentsand it focuses on how to generate the same semanticrepresentation from different syntactic structures,and how to generate different semantic representa-tions from a semantically ambiguous sentence.
Weexploit and extend the Generative Lexicon Theory(Pustejovsky, 1995; Bouillon, 1996) to develop a for-mal description of adnominal constituents in a lexi-con which can offer a solution to these problems.We classify the problematic behavior of Japaneseadnominal constituents into "static disambiguation"and "dynamic disambiguation" tasks.
Whereasstatic disambiguation can be done using the lexicalinformation in a dictionary, dynamic disambigua-tion needs inferences at the knowledge representa-tion level.
This paper mainly discusses dynamic dis-ambiguation.2 C lass i f i ca t ion  of  the  Usage  o fJapanese  Adnomina l  Const i tuentsOn consideration f the syntactic relations betweenadnominal constituents and their head nouns, wefind that some adnominal constituents can appearboth in the attributive and predicative positions(Sakuma, 1967; Martin, 1975; Makino and Tsutsui,1986).
However, some adjectives express differentmeanings when they appear in one or the other po-sition and some adjectives can appear only in one ofthese two positions (Hashimoto and Aoyama, 1992).We have classified the semantic relations betweenadnominal constituents and their modified nouns,based on whether the paraphrasing from attributiveposition to predicative position is possible or not.There are three possibilities:(Type A)A  paraphrase can be made withoutchanging the modifying relations emantically.Ad.
+ N - ,  N $~ (ga) Ad.
(N is Ad.)Ad.
= Adnominal constituentN = Head noun of noun phrase whichis modified by Ad.
(Type B) A paraphrase can be made only when anoun is restricted by its context: the presenceof modifiers or determiners, e.g., articles.Ad .
+ N --* ~:?
)(sono) N F~ (wa) Ad.
(that N is Ad.
)(Type C) A paraphrase cannot be made at all, i.e.,only the attributive position is available.Ad.
+ N --~ *none.We can classify semantic relations between ad-nominal constituents and their head nouns into threetypes by the use of paraphrase.
Paraphrases xist forboth Type A and Type B, however, a paraphrasecannot be made at all for Type C. This differenceis based on the fact that adnominal constituents intypes A and B modify the referents of their mod-ified nouns, while adnominal constituents in TypeC do not modify their head nouns directly.
TypeC adnominal constituents modify (a) only a part ofthe meanings which their modified nouns allow, (b)the contents of the referents of their modified nouns,or (c) the states of being of the referents of theirmodified nouns.
In this paper, we do not describethe semantic relations of (b) in detail but discuss489the semantic relations of (a) and (c) in the followingsection.There is a set of adnominal constituents whichhas the function of both adnominal and adverbialconstituents (Teramura, 1991), and the third re-lation (c) above is the adverbial semantic relationwhich holds between adnominal constituents andtheir head nouns.3 Classification of ProblematicBehavior of Japanese AdnominalConst i tuentsIt is important for the analysis of adjectives to con-sider what its head noun denotes in the sentence(Bouillon, 1996).
Also, when we analyze word mean-ings, it is important o take both context and ourworld knowledge into account (Pustejovsky, 1995;Lascarides and Copestake, 1998).
In this section,the behavior of Japanese adnominal constituents iclassified into three types, depending on how the se-mantic representation f noun phrases is generatedfrom information in the lexicon (Kanzaki and Isa-hara, 1997; Kanzaki and Isahara, 1998).The types are: (1) the type where one must inferthe attribute of the modified noun which is expressedby the adnominal constituent, (2) the type whichnecessitates inferences that change the structures ofthe semantic representation, and (3) the type whoseadnominal constituents do not add information tothe modified nouns but constrain the relations be-tween constituents in the text.
These types are ex-plained in this section.
Both semantic types A andB correspond to syntactic types 1 and 2.
Type Ccorresponds to type 3.3.1 Adnomina l  Const i tuents  that  Expressthe At t r ibutes  of  the Modi f ied  Noun\[Static d isambiguat ion\ ]This is the case where an adnominal constituentmodifies a head noun semantically.
Adnominal con-stituents modify nominals yntactically and most ofthese modify their head nouns semantically.
Here,the "analysis" of the relationship between adnomi-nal constituents and their head nouns concerns thechoice of the particular attribute of the nouns whichadnominal constituents modify.
There are two typesof inferences for disambiguation.3.1.1 Adnomina l  Const i tuents  that  ExpressUnique  Inherent  At t r ibutes  o f  theModi f ied  NounThis is the case in which the relation between theadnominM constituent and its modified noun, i.e.,what slot of the modified noun the modifier fills, canbe predicted.In Example 1, F@$~P~Tk (yuruyaka_na, gen-tle)_l is the attribute value of an instance of theconcept I -~  t (keisha, slope)J .
The instance \[-{~~r (keisha, slope)J involves a unique inherent at-tribute, i.e., "the angle (degree) of the slope," there-fore r@~-~,~ (yuruyaka_na, gentle)J is takento be a value on the scale of the slope.
The noun inthis example has a unique inherent attribute whosevalue is number or intensity.Example  1yuruyaka_na keisha ,gentle slopeJapanese pronunciationliteral translation3.1.2KEISHA (slope) YURUYAKA_NA (gentle) \]degree IAdnomina l  Const i tuents  that  ExpressOne of  the  Ma jor  At t r ibutes  o f  theMod i f ied  NounThis is the case in which the NLP system must iden-tify the slot of the modified noun which is filled bythe modifier.
Most nouns do not have a uniqueinherent attribute but have several attributes thatadnominal constituents may embody.
In Example2, \[-:~1 (otoko, man)J has several major attributes,e.g., name, age, character, and physique.
An un-derstanding system must choose a suitable attribute(i.e., physique in this example) to plug informationin from these attributes.Example  2oogara_nalargeotokomanOTOKO (man) ~,~age \[ I " -  OOGARA_NA (large)name I ' ~._1"phys ique/  v J  ,character ~ \[ \]These types of adjectives can appear both in thepredicative position and in the attributive positionwithout changing their meanings (Sakuma, 1967;Teramura, 1991; Hashimoto and Aoyama, 1992).r:gk:~: (oogara_na, large)J in Example 2 can ap-pear in predicative position, i.e., I -~:?
)~IJ~Jk:~(sono otoko wa oogara_da, that man is large)_l , withthe same meaning that the man has a big physique.We cannot decide on one particular attribute ofthe head noun without suitable semantic informa-tion.
Also, still another problem remains here, that490is to identify whether the sentence needs a genericreading or whether it represents an instance of theconcept.3.2 Adnomina l  Const i tuents  that  ExpressAt t r ibutes  of  the S i tuat ion In ferredf rom the Modi f ied Noun \ [Dynamicd isambiguat ion  1\]In some cases, adnominal constituents do not modifyinstances of nouns themselves, but modify, instead,instances of events, situations, or knowledge that areinferred from (the context of) the modified noun.3.2.1 The Case in which New E lementsmust be Infered in the Semant icRepresentat ionThere are cases in which we have to  infer new ele-ments in the semantic representation so as to rep-resent semantic relations between adnominal con-stituents and their modified nouns.In Example 3, the adjective modifies ome eventparticipated in by the household members.
A housecannot have a temporal scale as an attribute, how-ever, an event, in this example, spring-cleaning, canbe inferred from the context and therefore the ad-jective F~w (hayai, early)J can modify the event,e.g., the beginning time of spring-cleaning.However, its computational implementation is notso simple, because there are metonymic extensionsgoing on in this example.
For example, even if anNLP system can find "spring-cleaning" in the con-text as an event whose "begining-time" is "early,"the system must infer the people living there from"house" and identify him/her as an agent of thespring-cleaning.Some of these inferences are done using syntacticstructure in English, however , that is not possible inJapanese.
Such metonymic extensions are essentialfor determining the nature of the modifier/modifiedrelationships in Japanese (Matsumoto, 1993).Example  3(oosoji_no) hayai ie(spring-cleaning) early house"The house whose member begins spring-cleaningearly.
"OOSOJI HAYAI (early) (spring-cleanin~) , \[I beginning-time --------~- II 'HITO(  on)IE (house) I\]member \] ..--13.2.2 The Case in which a Concept mustbe Conver ted  into a Set of ConceptsAdnominal constituents sometimes do not modifynouns as a whole but modify only specific features ofa noun.
Example 4 is ambiguous.
The "as a whole"interpretation is that this person likes something andhe/she is abnormal as a whole, i.e., this person hassome mental disorder.
The "specific" interpretationis that this person likes something abnormally, i.e.,the way this person likes something is abnormal, i.e.,this person is crazy about something x. Ambiguitiesof \ [ '~ ,~ (ijo_na, abnormal)_l in Example 4 willbe discussed systematically below.Example  4ijo_na sensei-jutsu_no aikoshaabnormal astrology enthusiast, one wholikes something verymuchAs a whole interpretationIJO AIKOSHA SENSEI-JUTSUabnormal) (enthusiast) (astrology)ISpecific interpretationIJO AIKO-SURU SENSEI-JUTSU(abnormal) (like) (astrology)object object ~ \[To treat the "specific" interpretation, the systemhas to perform the concept conversion (Isahara andUchida, 1995) shown in Figure 1.As for the "as a whole" interpretation, an adnomi-nal constituent modifies an extension of the modifiee(e.g., what is abnormal is a person who is an astrol-ogy enthusiast).
Therefore, the object slot of (aninstance of) "abnormal" is filled by (an instance of)"enthusiast."
In the "specific" interpretation, how-ever, an adnominal constituent modifies part of theintensions to which the modifiee refers (e.g., what isabnormal is the way that person likes something).An analysis module converts the semantic structure(Figure 1) and the object slot of (an instance of)"abnormal" is filled by (an instance of) "like" whichis extracted by the concept conversion.1There is one more interpretation that "an enthusiast wholikes abnormal astrology," however, this interpretation is oddin this example.491AIKOSHA (enthusiast) somethingConceptConversionAIKO-SURUlike) somethingob jec t~ 'lagent----\[-\] \[ \]~HITO (perTn)"enthusiast" JFigure 1: Concept ConversionThe concept conversion is, in a sense, a paraphraseof the original expression.
The concept conversionis also useful in analyzing Example 5.Example 5sensei-jutsu_no i jo_na aikoshaastrology abnormal enthusiastExample 5 is not ambiguous, i.e., the only inter-pretation is % person who likes astrology abnor-mally," because the "as a whole" interpretation isnot possible.
Example 5 can be paraphrased intothe phrase shown in Example 6.
If I -~  (sensei-jutsu, astrology)A is semantically an object of r~~-"f B (aiko_suru, like)A, r~$~c (ijo_ni, abnor-mally)2 cannot modify r~ (mono, person)J , be-cause the dependencies in this interpretation crosseach other.Example 6sensei-julsu_wo ijo_ni aiko_suru monoastrology abnormally like personExample 7 exhibits the adnominal constituentF~?~ (ijo, abnormal)J in a predicative position.Using the extension of the Late Closure strategy(Frazier, 1979), only the "as a whole" interpretationis possible.Example 7aikosha_ga ijo_daenthusiast abnormal"The enthusiast is abnormal.
"3.3 Adnomina l  Const i tuents  that  Constra inthe Relations between Const i tuents  inthe Text \[Dynamic d isambiguat ion 2\]3.3.1 Adnomina l  Const i tuents  that  do notAdd Informat ion to their Modif iedNouns DirectlyAdnominal constituents mostly modify nouns syn-tactically and also semantically.
However, someadnominal constituents work differently, i.e., theymodify nouns syntactically but not semantically.Japanese nominal adjectivals F~:  (junsui_na,pure)A, F~.~::~: (kanzen_na, perfect/complete).\]and \[-:~ < (mattaku, entire).\] are typical examplesof this type.1-i~4~ (junsui_na, pure)A in Examples 8-10 and\ [ -~.~: (kanzen_na, complete)_l in Examples 11-13play different semantic roles.Example 8junsui_napure"pure water"Example  9t~atekkyo_wabordertransgressionmizuwaterjunsui_na seiji_bomei datta.pure political (copula,flight past)"The border transgression was a pure politicalflight.
"Example 10junsui_na churitsu_wa mutsukashii.pure/strict neutrality difficult"Strict neutrality is difficult.
"Example 11kanzen_na shisutemu dewa nai.complete system (copula) (negation)"This is not a complete (perfect) system.
"Example 12nousakumotsu_wa kanzen_na syohizai dearu.farm products complete consumer (copula)products"Farm products are nothing but consumerproducts.
"Example  13kanzen_na mujin_no yakalacomplete uninhabited house"absolutely uninhabited house"492In Example 8, F i~ (junsuLna, pure)J de-scribes the purity of water, i.e., it describes ome-thing within the "water" concept.
The adnominalconstituent I-gk:~Tz (oogara_na, large)J , in Exam-ple 2, expresses a value of an attribute of the modi-fiednoun, i.e., \[-~ (oloko, man)J .
In contrast, theadnominal constituent \ [ -~  (junsui_na, pure)J ,in Example 8, does not express a value of an at-tribute of the modified noun, i.e., FT\]( raizu, wa-ter)\] , but expresses the way some values fill at-tributes of this modified noun.
That is "nothing butwater is a filler of an attribute of the referent."
InExample 11, F-~_/k (kanzen_na, complete)\] de-scribes the completeness of a system as well, i.e.,it describes omething within the "system" concept,e.g., the function of the system.
(Case 1)In Example 9, F i~  (junsuLna, pure).l doesnot add information as to the purity of this polit-ical flight, however, it describes that there is onlyone purpose (or motivation), i.e., political flight, forthis "border transgression."
In other words, there isno other motivation, such as sightseeing or economicreasons, which would explain this action.
{ -~,~:(junsui_na, pure)J describes omething outside ofthe "political flight" concept.
In Example 12, r~:~.~ (kanzen_na, complete)J plays a very similarrole to that in Example 9.
It notes that there isonly one purpose, i.e., consumer products, whichdescribes "farm products."
In other words, thereare no other usages, such as raw materials, for theseproducts.
(Case 2)Both referents in Examples 8 and 9 are still "wa-ter" or "political flight" even if they are not "pure,"however, Example 10 means that strict neutrality isdifficult, and "not pure" neutrality is not a neutral-ity in the strict sense of the word.
\ [ '~4~ (jnn-suLna, pure)3 describes the concept "neutrality"itself.
As for Example 13, "not absolutely" unin-habited is not uninhabited in the strict sense of theword, as well.
(Case 3)There are similar phenomena involving manyother adnominal constituents in Japanese.
Formaltreatment of these phenomena will be discussed inSection 4.1.3.3.2 Adnomina l  Const i tuents  whichRepresents a State of BeingSome adnominal constituents, e.g., F:~/:~(rippa_na, splendid)\] can be used in attributive po-sition so as to express the state of the modified noun.In Example 14, the adnominal constituent \ [ -3~(rippa_na, splendid)J does not describe aspectsof an island itself, but the nature of what is requiredfor it to be considered an island.
In other words"this really is an island, not a large rock.
"Example  14rippa_na sh~ma(splendid) (island)"Once this ocean mountain is elevated, or aswe described above, its top appears above theocean from the sea level falling, it will be areal island.
"Whereas adnominal constituents in Examples 8and 11 can appear both in the attributive posi-tion and in the predicative position without chang-ing their meanings, and Examples 9, 10, 12 and13 cannot appear in the predicative position with-out changing their meanings, when this F~&(rippa_na, splendid)J occurs in a predicative posi-tion, i.e., F~h~ "?t:_~7~ (shima ga rippa_da)J, itmeans that "the island is splendid," a state of theisland s.As \ [ - -0 :~ (rippa_na, splendid) ~ (shima, is-land)J without context has two interpretations, i.e.,describing aspects of an island itself, "the island issplendid," and describing the nature of what is re-quired for it to be considered an island, when anNLP system analyzes this noun phrase, the systemhas to choose a suitable interpretation from thesetwo possibilities in the context of the semantic re-lations between adnominal constituents and theirmodified nouns.
Furthermore, in order to inter-pret the semantic relations between adnominal con-stituents and their modified nouns, it is sometimesnecessary to infer instances of newly introduced con-cepts using both contextual and world knowledge.Example 3, I - -~  (hayai, early) ~ (ie, house)_\] ,in Section 2.2.I illustrates this.
It is important fora lexical semantic system to take both context andour world knowledge into account.
We should ana-lyze semantic functions of lexical items from severalpoints of View.4 Formal Treatment of ProblematicPhenomena of JapaneseAdnominal  Const i tuentsIn this section we discuss the formal treatment of thephenomena described in Section 3.3.1, i.e., Cases 1,2 and 3.4.1 Hypothes is  and Def in i t ionTo handle these phenomena, we have established thefollowing hypothesis and definition.2 "Real" is a similar example in English.
"A real friend"means "true friend" and "His friend is real" means "his friendis not imaginary.
"493\[HYPOTHESIS\](a) There is something which can be shared bya plural number of constituents, e.g., thereis some semantic definition which can con-tain/represent/embody/refer to various items.
(b) Fi~IC~Z (junsui_na, pure)J works to constrainthis number to one.Extending the Generative Lexicon format, some-thing pure is represented asAz\[stg(x) A Telic = !1 Ae\[~oa,~ob, ~c,...\]\]Here, '!1' is a function which restricts the number ofits element o one.\ [DEF IN IT ION\ ]F~Z Uunsui_na, pure)3 is represented aspure ~ ASemN.ANewArg.\[p(SemN, NewArg)\](1)Here, SemN and NewArg are underspecified types.In syntax, an adnominal constituent takes a nounas a syntactic argument and returns the same syn-tactic category (i.e., a noun).
Semantically, it takesthe semantics of the noun first, and returns the se-mantics of a one-place function, that is it narrowsthe semantic definition of the noun.Starting from (1), suppose we define 'p' as follows:Case 1 (SemN is constitutive/mass materialtherefore NewArg is too.
):p ~ Vy.\[~(SemN(y)) --~ ~(y E NewArg)\]This is logically equivalent to the following:p ~ ~3y.\[~(SemN(y)) A (y e UewArg)\](3)In Example 8, F i~:  Ounsui_na, pure) ;t~(mizu, water)J , SemN is water and NewArgis some liquid referred to by this example sen-tence.
That is "anything that is not water doesnot exist in this liquid.
"Case 2 (SemN is individual entity/event.
):p VU.\[- (u=SemN)--~ ~(view( NewArg, y))\](4)In Example 9, Fi~i~#-J: (ekkyo_wa, bordertransgression) ~ (junsui_na, pure) ~'~I:~(seiji_bomei, political flight) f~-9 f~o ( datta,(copula, past))3 , SemN is "a political flight.
"The sentence refers to the fact that "the bordertransgression is a pure political flight."
Thus, itis associated with the interpretation fNewArg,that is there is only one view of this action (bor-der transgression), i.e., "political flight.
"It seems that the semantics of "pure" shares thebasic logical structure as seen in (2), (4), however,case 3 requires a different reatment.Case 3 (SemN is predicate/state.
): If SernN is apredicate/state P, NewArg is generated as asortal array of P and ~P.
The binary predi-cate is coerced into a polar predicate.As for Example 10, neutrality is originally a bi-nary sortal predicate, that isVP\[neutrality(P) V neutrality(~P)\].In this case, neutrality is coerced into two polarpredicates, i.e., c~ which denotes "strictly neu-tral" and/3 which denotes "strictly not neutral.
"'~  a '  and '~  fl' denote "not strictly" neutral,or a range of situation which can be consideredas neutral.4.2 Adnorninal  Const i tuents  and Adverb ia lConstituentsJapanese nominal adjectivals, uch as F~ (junsui,pure)_l , are inflected as follows 3.F~(2~CZ (junsui_na, pure)J , adnominalFEW- OunsuLni, purely)_l , adverbialF~2~ (junsuLsa, purity)J < nominalThe nominal adjectival Fi~d~ (junsui, pure(ly))Jmodifies F i~g: :~ (seiji-bomei, political flight)Jsyntactically in Example 15 (adnominal) and mod-ifies Ffg-gfc (datla, (copula, past))J syntacticallyin Example 16 (adverbial).
These two sentences havedifferent syntactic structures, however, they have al-most the same meaning 4.
Descriptions in a lexi-con of nominal adjectivals, such as F~I~ (junsui,3These expressions belong to the same syntactic ategory,nominal adjectival.
In English, on the contrary, the adnomi-hal constituent "pure" is an adjective and the adverbial con-stituent '~purely" is an adverb.4Readers might think that the Japanese copula in gen-eral syntactically takes a noun and returns ome kind of verbphrase.
Then, as in the ease of the English copula, the se-mantics of the Japanese copula is "transparent."
Thus, thefunction of 'tpure" taking either the adnominal or the adver-bial form should apply to the semantics of the common oun,494pure(ly))J , must be able to explain this kind of lin-guistic phenomena.Example  15junsui_na seiji-bomei dalta.pure political flight (copula, past)Example  16~ ~ ~ ~ ~ojunsui_ni seiji-bomei datta.purely political flight (copula, past)Example  17~ ~ "~ ~ osezjimbomei da~ta.political flight (copula, past)A nominal refers to an extension of a thing withone or several intension(s).
A copula refers to an in-stance of a state, which is a subconcept of an event.This state also has one or several extension(s) ofevents.
The meanings of Examples 15, 16 and 17are a function (or mapping) from extensions, i.e.,"the border transgression," to intensions, i.e., "al-ternative views about a certain event."
Then, Ex-ample 17, "the border transgression was a politicalflight" without "pure," corresponds to alternativeviews about "the border transgression," where theparticular view as "political flight" is positively as-serted and others are left unstipulated.
Then, Ex-ample 17 can be represented as follows;statel(views= extensionl(views = political flight,intensionl2, ...)extension2(views = intension21,intension22, ...)extension3(views = intension31,intension32, ...)...)I '~  (junsui, pure(ly))3 in its adnominal usage(Example 15) corresponds to the views of an exten-sion and constrains the number of intensions to oneby using the function '!1' introduced in Section 4.1as shown in the following;which is indistinguishable from other one-place verbs.
How-ever, some Japanese adjectives, e.g., r~,~ (akai, red)2 canbe used only as an adnominal constituent.~,w (akai, red (adnominal)) ~ (hako, box) E (da, (copula))*~< (akaku, red (adverbial)) ~i (hako, box) E (da, (copula))The copula in Examples 15-17 has a meaning similar to theverb "exist," therefore, it is not "transparent."
Thus, it isnecessary to analyze ach of these sentences differently as wewould sentences with ordinary verbs.extensionl(views = intensionl,intension2,extensionl(views = intensionl).
.
.
)Then Example 15 is represented as follows;statel(views= extensionl(views = political flight)extension2(views = intension21,intension22 .
.
.
.
)extension3(views = intension31,intension32 .
.
.
.
)...)\ [ ' i~  (junsui, pure(ly))_l in its adverbial usage(Example 16) corresponds to a state and singles outone extension using the function '!
1' as the followingshows;statel(views = extensionl,extension2, .
.
.
)statel(views = extensionl)Then Example 16 is represented as follows;statel (views= extensionl(views = political flight,int ension21 .
.
.
.  )
)Strictly speaking, these three example sentencesrepresent different meanings.
However, one tends totake no notice of this difference in daily conversation.Here, we introduce a new hypothesis to explainthe similarity of these representations.\ [HYPOTHESIS \ ]Extensions and intensions which are not men-tioned by overt expressions are not stressed in thecontext.
They contribute little to the interpretationof a sentence.Therefore, Examples 15, 16 and 17 can be repre-sented similarly as follows;statel(views= extensionl(views = political flight))The above simplification for Example 17 was alldone following the above hypothesis, however, partsof the simplifications for Example 15 and 16 were de-pendent on the presence of "pure."
Therefore, thereliability of these simplifications i different.
To dis-cuss this interesting fact further is, however, beyondthe scope of this paper.4955 ConclusionThis paper discussed the treatment oflinguistic phe-nomena in Japanese adnominal constituents and itfocused on how to generate the same semantic rep-resentation from different syntactic structures, andhow to generate different semantic representationsfrom a semantically ambiguous sentence.In this paper, we classified the characteristics ofadnominal constituents.
That is (1) the type whereone must infer what attribute of the modified nounis expressed by adnominal constituents, (2) the typenecessitates inferences that change the structures ofsemantic representation, and (3) the type where theadnominal constituents do not add information totheir modified nouns but constrain the relations be-tween constituents in the text.To achieve good results in natural anguage pro-cessing, e.g., high-quality machine translation, wehave to consult lexicons based on concepts and sowe exploited a concept representation method basedon the Generative Lexicon Theory and a conceptconversion module.
Using these techniques, we ex-plained how the semantic ambiguities of adnominalconstituents can be dealt with by analyzing the mod-ification relations between adnominal constituentsand their modified nouns.For a more precise explanation of adnominal ex-pressions within our framework, it would be neces-sary to treat (1) the scope of negation, (2) negationand position of adnominal constituents, i.e., attribu-tive and predicative position, and (3) disambigua-tion with regard to the context and the position ofadnominal constituents.H.
