and dar ?give?
and causative operator verb (VopC) constructions involving these sameverbs, in Brazilian Portuguese (BP), which form a complex set of relations: (i) both verbs arethe support verb of the same noun (SVC); (ii) dar is the standard (active-like) SVC while teris a converse (passive-like) SVC; and (iii) dar is a VopC, operating on a ter SVC.
In this paperwe have systematically studied these complex relations involving SVC and VopC for BP, whichconstitute a challenge to Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, and have been often ig-nored in related work.
The paper proposes a lexically-based strategy to implement SVC in afully-fledged, rule-based parsing system, yielding an adequate semantic structure of the events(predicates) denoted by predicative nouns in SVC.1 Introduction: basic concepts and a little historyThe notion of support verb has been in use for a long time, under many different theoretical perspectivesand various terminologies.
In this paper, we adopt the Zellig S. Harris?s (1991) transformational operatorgrammar framework.
As early as 1964, Harris (1964, p.216-7) proposed the concept and named thisparticular type of construction as ?U operator?
nominalizations, linking sentences such as He studieseclipes = He makes studies of eclipses.
It was, however, M. Gross (1981) who first provided the definitionof support verb we will rely upon here.
The support verb make (in the example above) can be seen asa sort of an auxiliary of the predicative noun studies, in charge of carrying the grammatical values oftense and person-number agreement that the noun is morphologically unable to express.
In many cases,support verbs are practically devoid of meaning.
For lack of space, we cannot detail further the propertiesof SVC, and only the briefest outline is provided here; a good overview can be found in (Gross, 1996;Gross, 1998; Lamiroy, 1998).One of the most important theoretical contribution of the notion of support verb came from the factthat it provides a natural framework to adequately include in the kernel sentences of the language thelarge number of ?abstract?
nouns, which do not have neither a verbal nor an adjectival counterpart; thatis, they are isolated or autonomous nouns, lacking any nominalizations (in a synchronic perspective,at least).
This phenomenon is particularly evident in Romance languages (French, Italian, Portuguese,Romanian and Spanish): FR: Jean a fait gr`eve ?Jean did strike?
; IT: Giovanni ha fatto sciopero ?id.?
;PT: O Jo?ao fez greve ?id.?
; RU: Ioan a f?acut grev?a ?id.?
; SP: Joan hizo huelga ?id.?
; cp.
EN: *John didstrike, John was on strike).Finally, nominal constructions are unlike any other predicative part-of-speech by the fact that predica-tive nouns can present more than one construction with different support verbs, while still expressing thesame semantic predicate.
Hence, for example, greve ?strike?
can have a SVC with both fazer ?to make?
(as above) and estar em ?to be in?
: O Jo?ao est?a em greve ?Jo?ao is on strike?
(Ranchhod, 1990).
EachSVC has its own specific properties, e.g.
only SVC with fazer can undergo passive, while the generalpredicate remains the same.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

a causative operator verb (VopC), which adds a new element to an elementary sentence; this ele-ment has an easily identifiable meaning: CAUSE; distributionally, this element suffers very looseconstraints (and we define this as a distributionally non constraint position (Nnr)); if the base sen-tence under the operator is a support verb construction 1, the VopC may ?absorb?
the support verband it may also introduce some formal changes in that sentence 1;(1) Isso d?a # Max tem (fome + medo + sede).1?This gives # Max has (hungry + fear + thirst).?
(2) Isso d?a (fome + medo + sede) em Max.
?This gives Max (hungry + fear + thirst).
?In (2), the support verb ter is absorbed under the operator dar and its subject becomes a dative, indirectcomplement, though the semantic roles of subject of dar (CAUSE) and of the subject of the predicativenoun (EXPERIENCER), after this restructuring, remain the same.?
a linking operator-verb (VopL), which hardly modifies the meaning of the underlying sentence; italso adds an argument to the base sentence 1, but this is not a new one since it is bounded linked toa noun complement of the base sentence 1 (Ranchhod, 1990).
(3) Max tem # Ana est?a sob o controle do Max.
?Max has # Ana is under Max?s control.?
(4) = Maxitem Ana sob o (seui+ *meu + *teu) controle.
?Maxihas Ana under (hisi+ *my + *your)control.
?This paper reports an ongoing research to systematically classify the predicative nouns built with thesupport verbs dar and ter in Brazilian Portuguese (Rassi and Vale, 2013; Santos-Turati, 2012).
Similarwork has already been developed for the European variety (Vaza, 1988; Ranchhod, 1990; Baptista, 1997;Baptista, 2005).
For many languages, including Portuguese, the studies on support verb constructionsand causative constructions use a lexical approach, aiming at building dictionaries or lists of predicativenouns or at identifying those constructions (semi)automatically, e.g.
for Portuguese (Hendrickx et al.,2010; Duran et al., 2011), for English (Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995), for German (Hanks et al., 2006;Storrer, 2007) and many other languages.
As far as we could ascertain, no implementation of these SVCconstructions has been made yet in NLP systems, particularly in parsers.
Most systems considering theseconstructions just treat them as multiword expressions, ignoring their internal syntactic structure.In this paper, we will show the complex set of relations involved in these SVC, where these verbscan function not only as support but also as operator verbs, thus rendering their description remarkablycomplex, particularly in view of Natural Language Processing.
We aim at capturing the syntactic de-pendencies involved in these expressions, not as multiword, fixed strings, but as analyzable syntacticstructures.The paper is structured as follows: Next, Section 2 presents the current state of the collection andclassification if these SVC in Brazilian Portuguese; Section 3 illustrates the syntactic-semantic relationsbetween different constructions of ter and dar; Section 4 proposes a strategy for implementing the data ina rule-based parsing system; and, finally, Section 5 presents some concluding remarks and perspectiveson future work.2 Support verb constructions with ter ?have?
and dar ?give?The predicative nouns in this paper select the support verbs dar ?give?
and ter ?have?, and were retrievedfrom previous lists of predicative nouns in European Portuguese (Vaza, 1988; Baptista, 1997) and fromthe PLN.BR Full corpus (Bruckschein et al., 2008).
This corpus contains 103,080 texts, with 29 milliontokens, consisting of news pieces from Folha de S?ao Paulo, a Brazilian newspaper (from 1994 to 2005).All these constructions were validated in real data, and in some cases also ressourcing to the web.1In the examples, elements between brackets and separated by the ?+?
sign can all appear in that given syntactic slot.
Thesymbol ?#?
delimits clauses, while the ?*?
mark signals the sentence as unacceptable.
Correferent elements are linked bycorreference indexesi.
For clarity, all support verbs will be shown without italics in the examples.
An approximate translationof Portuguese examples is provided, but its acceptability is irrelevant for the paper.932.1 Nominal predicates with support verb ter ?have?We adopted several criteria that allowed us to constitute lexical-syntactic, relatively homogeneous,classes.
These criteria were inspired in those taken from previous classifications, developed in theLexicon-grammar framework of Maurice Gross (1975; 1988; 1996), for both Portuguese and other lan-guages.
The main classification criteria can be summarized as follows: (i) the number of arguments,considering constructions with a subject and one or two essential complements as arguments; (ii) thepossibility of a noun admitting a sentential construction (in subject or complement position); (iii) thedistributional nature of the arguments: if they are obligatorily human or allow for non-human nouns; (iv)the property of symmetry2between the arguments.Following these criteria, we have so far classified around 1,000 nominal constructions from a list with3,000 candidates of predicative nouns censed in the corpus (Santos-Turati, 2012).
The already classifiednominal predicates that select the support verb ter ?have?
in Brazilian Portuguese were divided into 9classes (Table 1)3.Class Structure Example/Gloss CountTH1 Nhum0ter Npred Ana tem uma beleza impressionante 465?Ana has an amazing beauty?TNH1 N-hum0ter Npred A tinta tem um tom escuro 138?The paint has a dark tone?TR1 N?hum0ter Npred (Ana + a m?usica) tem um ritmo contagiante 139?

(Rassi and Vale, 2013), thoughtwo differences were considered: (i) the constructions with a body-part noun (Npc) as argument weredistinguished as a special class for their particular properties; and (ii), no symmetric constructions werefound.
We classified 900 support verb constructions with verb dar ?give?
in Brazilian Portuguese into11 classes (Table 2).3 Relations between ter ?have?
and dar ?give?First of all, it is necessary to distinguish three different kinds of relations established between verb darand verb ter constructions.
The first type of relation considers the verbs dar ?give?
and ter ?have?
assynonymous and classified as standard support verb constructions.
The verb dar can replace the verb terwithout any changes in the meaning of the sentence or in the selection restrictions of the arguments:2The notion of symmetry in verbal constructions was initially presented by Borillo (1971) for French verbs - Paul rencontreson fr`ere ?Paul meets his brother?
/ Paul et son fr`ere se rencontrent ?Paul and his brother meet?.
In the case of the Portuguesenominal constructions, symmetry was presented in Ranchhod (1990) and Baptista (2005), who described the nominal predicateswith the support verbs estar com and ser de, respectively.3In Table 1 and Table 2, the left column shows the conventional codes for designating each class; and the second columnrepresents its syntactic structure, indicated as follows: Nhum and N-hum for human and non-human noun respectively; N?humfor both human or non-human noun; Npc for body-part noun; the indexes ?0?
and ?1?
indicate the subject and the complementposition, respectively; Npred stand for the predicative noun; Prep for preposition; QueF for completive.94Class Structure Example/Gloss CountDH1 Nhum0dar Npred Ana deu uma pirueta 133?Ana gave a pirouette?DNH1 N-hum0dar Npred O bal?ao deu um estouro 20?The baloon gave a burst?DR1 N?

?Ana (gave + had) (a + an) (tantrum + hissy fit + outburst + shiver + thing).
?The second type of relation concerns the transformation named Conversion by G. Gross (1982; 1989),in which the predicative noun is maintained and their arguments change their relative position, without,however, changing their semantic roles.
In these constructions, the sentence with AGENT subject iscalled the standard construction, while its equivalent sentence with the reversed argument order is calledthe converse construction.
Usually, the support verbs of the standard and the converse construction aredifferent, as it is also the preposition introducing the converse complement:(6) Ana deu algum apoio ao Max.
?Ana gave some support to Max.?[Conv.]
= Max teve algum apoio da Ana.
?Max had some support from Ana.
?The third kind of relation linking the sentences with the verb ter and the verb dar is the causativeoperator construction (already mentioned in ?1):(7) Isso deu # Ana tem coragem.
?This gave # Ana has courage.
?= Isso deu coragem `a Ana.
?This gave courage to Ana.
?These three types of relations are presented in the table below, with an example and the respectivenumber of constructions in each type.
From the intersection between the list of predicative nouns con-structed with verb ter ?have?
and those with verb dar ?give?, we found 693 predicative nouns, distributedas shown in Table 3.dar ?give?

586Table 3: Comparative table with syntactic relations953.1 Verbs dar and ter in standard SVCAround 4.8% of the predicative nouns (35 constructions) accept both support verbs dar and ter in stan-dard constructions, such as:(8) A empresa (d?a + tem) atenc?
?ao ao cliente.
?The company (gives + has) attention to the client.?
(9) O rem?edio (d?a + tem) um efeito positivo no organismo.
?The medicine (gives + has) a positive effecton human body.?
(10) O resultado (deu + teve) um impacto significativo para o time.
?The result (gave + had) a significantimpact to the team.
?In Brazilian Portuguese, around 35 predicative nouns, such as febre ?fever?
and dengue ?dengue?,besides having both dar and ter as their support verb also allow dar as a causative operator on them(examples taken from the web):[VopC]: [Sua lic?
?ao de casa:] ?agua parada d?a dengue.
?[...]
still water gives (= causes) dengue.?
[CVS dar]: Inclusive, a vizinha tamb?em deu dengue.
?Inclusive, the neighbour gave (= had) dengue.?
[CVS ter]: O meu esposo j?a teve dengue.
?My husband already had dengue.
?A few nouns (around 10), such as amor ?love?, confianc?a ?trust?
and respeito ?respect?, besidesadmitting the two support verbs in their basic construction, also admit ter in a converse construction:(11) O filho d?a respeito `a m?ae.
?The son gives respect to the mother.
?= O filho tem respeito pela m?ae.
?The son has respect for the mother.?[conv.]
= A m?ae tem o respeito do filho.
?The mother has respect from her son.
?3.2 Verb dar as standard SVC and ter as converse SVCAround 10.4% of the predicative nouns (72 constructions) admit the verb dar in the standard constructionand the verb ter in a converse construction, but not ter as a standard support.
In Brazilian Portuguese,predicative nouns constructed with the support verb dar in a standard construction accept other converseverbs beyond the verb ter ?have?, such as receber ?receive?, ganhar ?gain?, levar ?get?
and tomar?take?4.
(12) Ana deu protec?
?ao ao Max.
?Ana gave protection to Max.
?= Max (teve + recebeu) a protec?
?ao da Ana.
?Max (had + received) the protection from Ana.?
(13) Ana deu uma ajuda ao Max.
?Ana gave a help to Max.
?= Max (teve + ganhou) uma ajuda da Ana.
?Max (had + gained) a help from Ana.?
(14) Ana deu uma resposta no Max.
?Ana gave an answer to Max.
?= Max (teve + levou) uma resposta da Ana.
?Max (had + got) an answer from Ana.?
(15) O policial deu uma multa ao Max.
?The officer gave a fine to Max.
?= Max (teve + tomou) uma multa do policial.
?Max (had + took) a fine from the officer.
?3.3 Verb dar as VopC and ter as SVCAround 84.8% (586 predicative nouns) of the elementary constructions with the support verb ter ?have?also allow the causative operator verb dar ?give?
; some of these nouns constitute relatively homogenoussemantic sets, e.g.
the predicative nouns that express <feeling>, <sensation>, <emotion> or those thatindicate <disease> (this semantic classification is just approximative):4For European Portuguese equivalent converse constructions, see Baptista (1997); for a comparison between the two lan-guage variants, see Rassi et al.
(2014).96(16) Ana tem alegria.
?Ana has happiness.?
(Z?e + A vinda do Z?e + O fato de Z?e ter voltado + Isso) deu alegria `a Ana.?
(Z?e + Z?e?s coming + The fact of Z?e has came + That) gave happiness to Ana.?
(17) Ana tem c?olica.
?Ana has colic.?
(O chocolate + O fato de ter comido chocolate + Isso) deu c?olica na Ana.?
(The chocolat + The fact of she has eaten chocolat + That) gave a colic in Ana.
?These predicative nouns allow a particular (impersonal?)
construction with dar, in which the argumentin subject position is not explicit, so the CAUSE element is also absent, and the sentence has the sameoverall meaning of the SVC with verb ter standard, but with an inchoative aspect; notice that the verbdar must be in the 3rdperson singular, and it does not agree with the predicative noun:(18) (Deu + *Deram) (uma) (alegria + c?olica) na Ana.
?Gives/gave (a) (hapiness + colic) in Ana.
?= Ana teve (uma) (alegria + c?olica).
?Ana had (a) (hapiness + colic).?
(19) (Deu + ?
*Deram) umas (palpitac?
?oes + c?olicas) na Ana.
?Gives/gave some (palpitations + colics) inAna.
?= Ana teve umas (palpitac?
?oes + c?olicas).
?Ana had some (palpitations + colics).
?3.4 Formalization into the Lexicon-GrammarBecause of the complex relations and the different syntactic status that the verbs dar and ter may show,these constructions are essentially determined by the lexicon, i.e., they depend on the specific predicativenoun.
It is only natural that a lexically-based approach be taken in order to describe this properties, partic-ularly in view of the implementation of such type of expressions in NLP systems.
The Lexicon-Grammarframework constitutes such a methodological setting, as it presupposes the extensive and systematicalsurvey and formal representation of the lexicon properties.In the Lexicon-Grammar, a systematic description of linguistic phenomena is usually presented inthe form of binary matrices: the lines contain the lexical entries while the columns represent syntactic-semantic properties of each entry.
For example, for each predicative noun, distributional constraintson the arguments are represented; the elementary support verb and the main variants of this verb areencoded; the possibility of accepting conversion and the converse support verbs are explicitly provided;and all these syntactic-semantic informations are specified for each predicative noun.
Besides its intrinsiclinguistic interest, the main purpose for this formalization requirements is the application of the data inNLP.
In the next section, we present a preliminary proposal for the implementation problems of thesetype of SVC in a rule-based parsing system of Portuguese.4 Towards the implementation of SVC in a NLP systemBesides its linguistic interest, one of the goals of the formal representation of the lexical properties ofpredicative nouns and SVC into a Lexicon-Grammar such as described above (?3.4) is to allow for theimplementation of these data in NLP systems.
In this section an outline of the strategy adopted forits implementation specifically into a rule-based system, namely STRING (Mamede et al., 2012)5, ispresented.
This is still an on-going work, so in the next lines we briefly sketch the system?s architecture(?4.1.)
and then (?4.2.)
we present the strategy that we intend to implement for the adequate parsing ofSVC with ter and dar, having in mind the complex structures and relations mentioned in ?3.4.1 STRING architectureSTRING is an NLP chain with a modular structure that executes all the basic processing tasks, namely:tokenization and text segmentation, part-of-speeh tagging, morphosyntactic disambiguation, shallowparsing (chuking) and deep parsing (dependency extraction).
The parsing stage is performed by therule-based parser XIP (Xerox Incremental Parser) (Mokhtar et al., 2002).
XIP identifies the elementary5http://string.l2f.inesc-id.pt/97constituents of a sentence, such as noun phrases (NP) or prepositional phrases (PP), and then these arestructured by binary dependencies between them, corresponding to the syntactic relations, such as sub-ject (SUBJ), direct complement (CDIR) or modifier (MOD).
STRING also extracts Named Entities,performs time expressions identification and normalization, Anaphora Resolution and some Word-Sensedisambiguation (WSD).At the final stages of parsing, the system extracts the text events (or predicates) and their participants(arguments).
The system currently extracts the EVENT structure for all full verbs and predicative nouns.In the case of verbs, it associates the events to their participants and circumstances, identifying theircorresponding semantic roles (Talhadas, 2014), based on the sentence parse and the information availableon the Portuguese full verbs Lexicon-Grammar (Baptista, 2012)6.
Hence, for a sentence such as (20),the system parser extracts the event structure by way of the following dependencies:(20) Max costuma ler o jornal no caf?e `as sextas-feiras.
?Max uses to read the newspaper at the caff?ee onFridays.
?EVENT AGENT(ler,Max)EVENT OBJECT(ler,jornal)EVENT LOC-PLACE(ler,caf?e)EVENT TIME-FREQUENCY(ler,a as sextas-feiras)4.2 StrategyIn the case of a predicative noun in a SVC, one would want the predicative noun also to be captured as anEVENT, but not the support verb, since its role is basically that of an auxiliary of the noun.
However, sincethe support verb conveys several important grammatical information, particularly the standard/converseorientation of the predicate7, a SUPPORT dependency is first extracted, so in sentences such as in (21)one would get the dependency shown below:(21) Max deu um beijo na Ana.
?Max gave a kiss in Ana.
?SUPPORT STANDARD(beijo,deu)To do so, one needs to provide the system with the information that dar is the (basic) standard supportverb of the predicative noun beijo ?kiss?.
It is also necessary to know that in this construction, thepredicative noun is the direct complement (CDIR) of the support verb and that the dative complementcan be introduced, in Brazilian Portuguese, by preposition em ?in/on?.
The following rules illustrate (ina simplified way8) the functioning of the rule-based system:if (CDIR(#1[lemma:dar],#2[lemma:beijo]) & ?SUPPORT(#2,#?
))SUPPORT[vsup-standard](#1,#2)if (SUPPORT(#1,?
))EVENT[OTHER=+](#1).if (SUPPORT[vsup-standard](#1[lemma:beijo],#2) &EVENT[other](#1) & SUBJ(#2,#3))EVENT[agent-generic=+](#1,#3).if (SUPPORT[vsup-standard](#1[lemma:beijo],#2) & EVENT[other](#1) &?MOD(#2,#3) & PREPD(#3,?
[lemma:em]) )COMPL(#1,#3),EVENT[patient=+](#1,#3).6This semantic role information is still not available for the predicative nouns, but it is currently being encoded.7The support verb can convey aspectual, modal and even stylistic values, which are encoded in the lexicon and remainavailable in the system?s output, even if not necessarily visible in the EVENT representation.8The rule system should also take into account the distributional constraints on the argument slots, but, for simplicity, wedismissed it in this paper.98if (SUPPORT[vsup-standard](#1[lemma:beijo],#2) & EVENT[other](#1) &(?MOD[dat](#2,#3) || ?CLITIC(#2,#3[dat]) ) )CINDIR[dat=?
](#1,#3),EVENT[patient=+](#1,#3).The rules read as follows: First, a SUPPORT dependency with the feature VSUP-STANDARD isextracted when the noun beijo ?kiss?
is the direct complement of the verb dar ?give?
(and no othersupport verb was extracted yet for that noun); based on this dependency, an EVENT (unary) dependencyis extracted for the predicative noun; then, the subject of the standard support verb is assigned theagent semantic role (agent-generic in STRING?s terminology); next, the prepositional phrasemodifying (MOD) the support verb and introduced by preposition em ?in?
is converted into a complement(COMPL) of the predicative noun and assigned a semantic role of patient; a similar procedure isused for the dative complement, when reduced to a dative pronominal form, but in this case, insteadof COMPL the CINDIR (indirect complement) dependency is used.
All these rules are automaticallyproduced for each predicative noun, from the information in the Lexicon-Grammar.
The correspondingEVENT structure is represented below:SUPPORT VSUP-STANDARD(beijo,deu)EVENT AGENT(beijo,Max)EVENT PATIENT(beijo,Ana)For the converse construction 4.2, while the EVENT structure remains the same, the SUPPORT depen-dency is:(22) Ana ganhou um beijo do Max.
?Ana got a kiss from Max.
?SUPPORT VSUP-CONVERSE(beijo,ganhou)The converse construction entails the ?swapping?
of the arguments?
syntactic function, while keepingtheir respective semantic roles.
The detection of the converse construction triggers a set of rules thatalso swap the semantic roles associated to the predicative noun?s syntactic slots.
In the case where thesame verb is both the standard and the converse support of a predicative noun, they are both extracted, atfirst, and then the presence of prepositional complements or the determiner of the noun can be used fordisambiguation.
This will be part of future work as, for the moment, whenever this happens, the converseconstruction is discarded.
The assigning of semantic roles to the predicative noun?s arguments is thenmade only once, and by general rules, both in the standard and in the converse constructions.The situation is somewhat similar in the case of a causative-operator verb 4.2:(23) Essa not?
?cia deu estresse no Max.
?This news gave stress in Max.
?In this case, since the Lexicon-Grammar has encoded that the verb dar can be an operator on ter,and since the predicative noun estresse ?stress?
does not allow for dar to be its support, a general rulecan apply, extracting the CAUSE relation expressed by the VopC, in a similar way as for the SUPPORTdependency.
The EVENT structure is thus construed as shown below:VOPC(estresse,deu)EVENT(estresse,other)EVENT EXPERIENCER(estresse,Max)EVENT CAUSE(estresse,not?
?cia)However, when the same verb can be both a support and an operator verb, in the absence of tell-taleprepositional complements or other syntactic evidence, the detection of the adequate structure can not bedone at this stage.
We found only 35 predicative nouns which can be associated to the verb dar ?give?with both categories, i.e.
as a support and a VopC.
It is also possible that both dependencies SUPPORTand CAUSE be extracted in order to disambiguate them at a later stage.995 Conclusions and future workIn the near future, we intend to use the data encoded in the Lexicon-Grammar of these predicative nounsand build a SVC identification module for STRING.
For the moment, the identification of all the syn-tactic phenomena, constituting as many different parsing cases as possible, is underway, in order tofully automatize the processing of converting the Lexicon-Grammar tables into the STRING, with XIP-compliant rules, in a similar way as it has already been done for the verbs (Baptista, 2012; Travanca,2013; Talhadas, 2014).
After implementing all the data in STRING we also intend to evaluate the systemin order to check the extraction of the dependencies involving the support verbs and predicative nouns.An important task ahead is the systematic comparison of the structures and properties here describedagainst those of European Portuguese.
First of all, the set of nouns available in each variant is not exactlythe same, even if the concepts are shared; for example, carona in BP corresponds to the EP boleia ?ride?
;in other cases, the choice of the nominalization suffixes differ: in BP one uses the term parada card?
?aca,while its equivalent in EP is paragem card?
?aca ?cardiac arrest?.
False-friends are also common: in BP,chamada ?rebuke?
is unrelated to EP chamada ?phone call?
(but, in this sense, it is also used in BP);the set of support verbs for each noun are different: as a synonym of rebuke we find the pair dar-levar(only in BP), while as equivalent to phone call the basic support verbs are fazer-receber (the same inBP and EP).
Naturally, much in both variants is quite similar, though some patterns begin to emerge:the different choice of prepositions for the complement, mostly the alternation between em ?in?
