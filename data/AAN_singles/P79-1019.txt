Xn this paper,we report on some ?tudle?
we are doing on reportdialogues.
We describe two kinds of phenomena we haveident i f ied ,  outl ine a preliminary process model thatin t ?g ra t ?

the report generation with the processesthat are generating the actions being reported upon,and spec i fy  a systemat ic  methodology For ext rac t ingrelevant evidence bearing on these phenomena t~om texttrenscrlpts of talk about doing to use in evaluatingthe model.~ O Z W ~ WReports of  problm solving actions are often used a?evident?
about the und?rlying cognit ive processesinvolved in generating a problem solution, as "problemsolving protocols"  (Howell & Simon, 1972).
However,these reports ere obviously a kind of languageinteract ion in the i r  own r ight ,  in which the subject i ?reportlns on hls/hor own actions to the experimenter.We have analyzed problem solving protocols of peoplesolving a puzzle called "Hlsslonaries and Cannibals"and have found that  in the i r  repor t ?
,  people adopt ??
point or view" with respect to the problan, through ?con?latent use of spat ia l  detxts, For example, when asubject lays:" .
.
,  X can't send another cannibal across withanother alssioflary or he w i l l  he outnumbered when hegets to the other side .
.
,  "the deix is  In her report places her as speaker off the?
from" side of the considered action, This isindicated both by the choice of the verb "send" and bythe description of "the other side".
?he same suhjeotindicated the "to n slde as her point or view in anotherpart or her protocol:" , .
. '
cause  you've gotta have one person to h r i~back the boat .
.
. "
4Here, both the verb "br ing" and the adverb "back"indicate "point ot  view".Although people almost always unmmbiguoualyspecify ?
"point of  view" within the problem they aresolving in thei r  reports, they also deny awareness oftakAn| such ?
point cF view, However, th is  point orview is important to the underlying problem solvingprocesmas.
The strongest evidence for this  comes ~omthe hi |h correlat ion ~etween Point or view and errorsin problem solv ing actions.
Subjects in the~tlsslonarles and Cannibals task can make er rors  byCabin| act ions  that  v io late  the const ra in ts  or thetask.
Host of these errors  occur on the side away f rmtheir  current "point s t  view", even theuah the i r  pointof view changes From one physical side to the otherduring the course or solving the pun le ,  mreinterest ing is  that most of the "undetected" errorsemcur on the side ?way from their  point or view.
Someerrors arm spontaneously detected by the subject~mmediately otter askant the action that leads to ?violation!
others ere "undetected".
After theexperimenter interrupts topo ln t  out these undetectederrors, the subjects often switch point of view so thatthe v io la t ion  condition is  now on the same side a?
thesubjects' point of view.We see the point of view indicated by ?patlaldelxls In the report of problem solving as reflec~ir~an underlying allocation of effort (or attention).
Pewerrors occur with problem elements that ?re givenprocessing effort, while constraints that ?re givenlittle attention are more often violated.%n this way, these reports are reflecting changes Znthe organization of the problem element?
that occurover the course of reaching a solution.
We have alsoident i f ied other ways in which report ?
embody the useof d i f ferent  conceptual organizations of the problem,inc luding org ?n l za t lons  that  vary from abst rac t  toconcrete and from perception oriented to actionoriented.JUSTZrZCATZON~~There ?re multi-utterance structures that occurregular ly  in problem solving ta lk  that we ca l l?
justltAoatlon argument structures."
These structureshave the form of:(did ) (do ) (since )(could)+(not do)+(aot ion) .
(bsc ?use)->(Just i t loat lon(w i l l )  argument)(A l ternat ive ly ,  these two segments san he reversed inorder, by using connectiv?s l i ke  "theretora" or "so".
)For example, these kinds of  dialogue units occur inmany ot the protocols studied by Newall & Simon (1972):"hen  letter has one and only one numerical value,e .
'(\[: One numerical value.)
There are ten differentletters and each of them has one numerloal value.Therefore, Z san, iooklng at the Wo D's each D is5; therefore, T is zero."
(Hewell& 8Amen,1972:230-231)Zn studying our problem solving protocols tram the~tseionarles and Cannibals puzzle, we have Identltiedseveral kinds of argument structures, depending on whatkinds of problem solving approach ?
?oh subject took tothe problem at each point An time.
For example, onecommon justification argument structure is the?

For exmmp/.e, wehave been able to treAn ooder8 I:o reZAsbly de~erm?ne a80"point of view" for a problem solver at each point inthe problem solving from a record of the problemsolving report and a record of moves made.
Then, weuse this extracted trace to evaluate our model of therole of point of view in problem solving.SUMMARYWe have reported here a three pronged approach tothe study of problem solving action and report: I) thecollected of data on problem solving and talk aboutproblem solving, 2) development of a process model ofthese behaviors, and 3) use of coding techniques toextract traces of "critical phenomena" from thetranscripts for evaluating the model.
So far, we havefocussed our efforts on two types of problem solvingphenomena: the changes in the problem solver'sorganization of the problem ("point of view"), andsystematic multl-utterance structures used to expressthe forms of inference used to solve the problem("Justificatlon argument structures").Ericsson, K.A., & Simon, H.A.
