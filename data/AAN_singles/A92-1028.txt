Zero Pronoun Resolution in aMachine Translation System by usingJapanese to EnglishVerbal Semantic Attributes.Hiromi Nakaiwa and Satoru IkeharaNTT Network Information Systems Laboratories1-2356 Take Yokosuka-Shi Kanagawa 238-03 JapanAbst rac tA method of anaphoral resolution of zero pronounsin Japanese language texts using the verbal semanticattributes is suggested.
This method focusesattention on the semantic attributes of verbs andexamines the context from the relationship betweenthe semantic attributes of verbs governing zeropronouns and the semantic attributes of verbsgoverning their referents.
The semantic attributes ofverbs are created using 2 different viewpoints:dynamic haracteristics of verbs and the relationshipof verbs to cases.
By using this method, it is shownthat, in the case of translating newspaper a ticles, themajor portion (93%) of anaphoral resolution of zeropronouns necessary for machine translation can beachieved by using only linguistic knowledge.Factors to be given special attention whenincorporating this method into a machine translationsystem are examined, together with suggestedconditions for the detection of zero pronouns andmethods for their conversion.
This study considersfour factors that are important when implementingthis method in a Japanese to English machinetranslation system: the difference in conceptionbetween Japanese and English expressions, thedifference in case frame patterns between Japaneseand English, restrictions by voice and restriction bytranslation structure.
Implementation of theproposed method with due consideration of thesepoints leads to a viable method for anaphoralresolution of zero pronouns in a practical machinetranslation system.1 IntroductionIn all natural anguages, components hat can be easilydeduced by the reader are frequently omitted f~om expressionsin texts.
In Japanese in particular, the subject and object areoften omitted.
These phenomena cause problems inmachine translation because components not overtlyindicated in the source language (i.e.
Japanese) becomemandatory elements in the target language (i.e.
English).Thus, in Japanese to English Wanslation systems itbecomesnecessary to identify corresponding case elements omittedfrom the Japanese original (these are referred to as "zeropronouns") to be translated into English expressions.Therefore, the technique of zero pronoun resolution is anextremely important function.Several methods have been proposed with regard to thisproblem.
Grotz et al proposed the method of resolvingdefinite noun phrases by using a centering algorithm.Kameyama expanded this concept by introducing propertysharing constraints and applied it to zero pronoun resolutionin Japanese.
This method relies on the types ofpostpositional particle and whether there are any empathy-loaded verbs to exercise control over priority rankings for thefocus of discourse segments.Yoshimoto suggested a method that uses topics from adialogue.
This method has focused attention on thecharacteristic of the Japanese language where the case for thesentence isdetermined by the type of postpositional particle(e.g.
"ha" (pronounced "wa"), "ga", "wo" and "hi" indicatethe theme, subject, direct object and indirect objectrespectively).
The method uses case elements accompaniedby the postpositional particle "ha" and case dements becomethe theme or subject matter through expressions governed bya special sentence structure pattern.Kuno classified zero pronouns into two categories(pseudo-zero, real-zero) and suggested separate resolutionmethods for each category.
This method handles pseudo-zeropronouns (omitted by across-the-board discourse deletion)and real-zero pronouns (topicalized noun phrase or a nounphrase existing in a dialogue scene which can become areferent, somewhat resembling personal pronouns in theEnglish language) separately from the point of the referentdetection method.The foregoing methods of anaphoral resolution can bedivided into two major groupings.
One uses comparativelysuperficial information such as the types of postpositionalparticles or the existence / non-existence of interjections.The other introduces the concepts of plans and scripts.When considering application to machine translation, theformer leads to problems in the precision of resolutionsbecause it is restricted to using specified information.
Thelatter needs common knowledge and world models and todevelop a translation system handling texts over a broadfield, the volume of knowledge to be prepared beforehand isso large that this method can be regarded as impossible torealize.Thus in this paper, attention has been focused on verbalsemantic attributes.
We propose a method of resolving zero201pronouns common in Japanese discourse.
The method usesthe dynamic haracteristics of verbs and the relationshipbetween verbs.
The rules needed by this method areindependent of the fields of the source text.
Therefore,anaphora resolution may be conducted with a relativelysmall volume of knowledge, so the proposed method is verysuitable for machine translation.2 Zero P ronouns  as v iewed f rom MachineTrans la t ionZero pronouns are very common in Japanese discourse, butthe number of zero pronouns that actually require resolutionvaries according to the purpose for which analysis results areto be used.
For example, the case of a question and answersystem involving a task such as replying to questions froma user who has just read a sentence.
The questions, whichcan come from several points of view, must be anticipated,and practically all of the zero pronouns in the sentence willrequire resolution.
In contrast, in the case of machinetranslation of text, depending on the translation languages,zero pronouns requiring resolution tend to limited.
Thispaper considers the task of extracting zero pronouns in aJapanese to English text machine translation system.
Wefirst examine the four basic factors important inimplementing such a system.2.1 The difference in conception betweenJapanese and English expressionsWhen extracting zero pronouns in machine translation,whether the zero pronouns require resolution analysis or notneeds to be decided.
For example, in the sentence.
(1)X-sha ha 2-gatsu-l-nichi, ha-dodhisuku-shouchi woCompanyX TOP February 1 hard disc device OBJhatsubai-suru.place on sale"Company X will put on sale the hard disc device fromFebruary 1.
"asubj aobj tsuki-4OO-dai seisan-suru.400 units per month produce"They produce 400 units of it per month.
"The second sentence has a structure that is centeredaround the verb "seisan-suru(produce)" and the subject andobject have become zero pronouns.
But to translate thesentence into natural English, there is a need to rewrite itinto a predicate noun sentence ("da" sentence, so calledbecause of the original Japanese "Gessan wa 400 dai da") tolead(2) Gessan ha 400-dai da.Monthly production TOP/SUBJ 400 units is"Monthly production is 400 units".To translate the expression in this form, referentialanalysis of the zero pronouns of the subject and object of theverb "produce" is no longer necessary.
When translatingthis type of expression, the syntactic/semantic structure ofthe sentence to be translated is first converted into anEnglish type structure in the source language (This is makesthe Japanese-Japanese conversion) in an analysis phase.Selection of only zero pronouns whose referent needs toresolved becomes possible.2.2 The difference in case frame patternsbetween Japanese and EnglishThere are verbs, the case elements of which are mandatory inJapanese but optional when translated into English.
Forexample, an expression such as,(3) X (facility) de Y (animals) wo kau.X at Y OBJ keep"At Y(facility), X(animals) are being kept.
"in which there is no subject in Japanese, it would bepossible to translate this by using the expression," X raiseY".
In cases uch as this, it would be useful to prepare casepatterns to be used for syntactic analysis for each and everytranslation of English verb form and designate the Englishcase structure when analyzing the Japanese.
Elements whichdo not become mandatory cases in English will then not bemandatory cases in Japanese ither.
Thus deciding whichzero pronouns must be analyzed can be done accurately.2.3 Restrictions by VoiceElements which have become zero pronouns in Japanesewill, if the voice can be changed to give natural English, notneed to be resolved.
For example,?
A sentence originally in the passive voiceIn this case, converting the English expression to passivevoice will limit the zero pronouns for which the referentmust be identified.?
Sentences containing verbs which take the passive voicein Japanese become active in English.
For example, theexpression,(4)A ga B (document) ni keisai-sareru.A OBJ B in publish-PASSIVE" A is published in B.
"is the passive expression of "osubj publishes A in B" inwhich the subject has become a zero pronoun.
In English,however, even though there is no subject in Japanese, it ispossible to translate this to the expression "A appears in B".In cases such as this, case frame patterns must be preparedby modifying the English language to be used in syntacticanalysis.
When analyzing the Japanese, it is possible tolimit the number of zero pronouns which must be resolvedby limiting mandatory case patterns to those instances thatare accompanied by passive aspects which are mandatorycases in the English case pattern.2.4 Restriction by translation structureIn the expression,(5)X-sha ha haadodhisuku-souchi wo hatsubai-suru.Company X TOP hard disc device OBJ place on sale"X Company will place on sale the hard disc device,"202osub sofuto wo OS ni Kumikomu-kow desoftware OBJ OS into incorporate-EMBEDDED bysetsuzoku-daisuu wo fuyasi-tanumber of units to be connected OBJ increase-PAST"They increased the number of units to be connected byincorporating the software into the OS.
"the verbs "incorlxnate" and "increase" have tamed the subjectinto a zero pronoun.
The sentence with "Kumikomu-koto(incorporate-EMBEDDED)" is structured as an"embedded sentence" modifying the action "koto".Translated into English, the portion "koto de" becomes themethodical case "by incorporating software into the OS" andassumes a gerund phrase xpression.
That is the embeddedsentence in Japanese becomes a prepositional phraseaccompanied by a gerund phrase.
Because different sentencestructures are generated between Japanese and English, zeropronouns need to be extracted by converting the Japaneseoriginal to an English like syntactic/semantic structure.In a Japanese to English machine translation system, itis important to classify zero pronouns with dueconsideration of the factors outlined above.3.
Appearance  o f  Zero  P ronouns  inNewspaper  Ar t i c lesWith due consideration of the conditions as presented inChapter 2, we examine where troublesome zero pronounsand their referents appear in newspaper articles.
Newspaperarticles generally tend to use compressed forms ofexpressions.
Thus, declinable words are frequently turnedinto nouns by compressing the declinable suffixes.
Thus,more often than not, it is impossible to determine the zeropronoun's referent merely by relying on postpositionalparticle information, themes or the types of empathy-loadedverbs.
For example,(6) NTT ha1WIq" TOP"NTr willshingata-koukanki wo dounyuu-sita.new model switchboard OBJ introduceintroduce a new model switchboard.
"esubj fiko-shindan-kinou wo wusai,self checking function OBJ equip"The new model switchboard is equip with self checkingfunction and"esubj 200-shisutemu wo secchi-suru yotei-da.200 systems OBJ install be-planning-to"NTI" is planning to install 200 systems.
"In the first sentence, the subject is topicalized, but in thesecond sentence, the subject of the first portion of thesentence and the subject of the latter portion of the sentenceare zero pronouns.
Of the two zero pronouns, in the formercase, the "shingata-koukanki"(new model switchboard),which is the object of the former sentence, and in the lattercase, "NTT", which is the subject of the former sentencebecome the referents.
Thus, when there are elements whichhave been topicalized, and there are no other elements thatcan be topicalized, it cannot be taken for granted thattopicalized elements will become the resolution elements forzero pronouns.
Under such circumstances, there is a need forinformation other than whether the element has beentopicalized or not, such as further semantic restrictions.The lead paragraphs in 29 newspaper articles, totaling102 sentences in all, were examined for zero pronouns andtheir referents, and the results are shown in Table 1.
Therewere 88 cases of zero pronouns.
According to this study,the case where elements topicalized by the postpositionalparticle "ha" in the first sentence became the referents of zeropronouns when being made the subject in the secondsentence, was most common, with 45 instances (51%).Furthermore, zero pronouns having referents in the firstsentence, totalled 76 instances (86%).
With newspaperarticles, the fast sentence contains information that gives anoutline of the entire article and thus the case element tendsto become the referent.
There were 67 instances (74%) ofzero pronoun referents in the second and following sentencesbeing used by the first sentence amounted to 67instances(74%) which strongly suggests the importance ofthe first sentence.ent/~earl~tlon*1st SUBJsent- OBJence2nd SUBJSentenoe OBJand after !

)* "Ha"(pronounced "Wa"),"Ga","Wo", which are postpositional particles in Japanese,respectively indicating thetheme, subject, direct object.203Moreover, there were 12 instances (14%) where thereferent was neither the theme nor the subject; the zeropronoun is the subject.
From this, it can be observed thatit would be inappropriate o rely solely on the technique ofselecting the referent from case elements that have beentopicalized or of determining the order of priorities forresolution elements from the type of postpositional particle.These 12 instances were studied further and found to containverbs that included the referent.
Such verbs were"hatsubaisuru" (sell), "kaisetsusuru" (establish),"kaihatsusuru" (develop) and other such words intended tointroduce new object elements.
Verbs for zero pronouns tendto be a noun predicate as in "LAN da" (That is LAN) -- \[InEnglish, it would correspond to the expression, "o be<noun>"\] or, to words such as "belong to" indicatingattributes.
To resolve this type of zero pronoun, it wouldappear essential that verb attributes be categorized and thezero pronoun referent be determined from the relationships ofverbal semantic attributes.4 C lass i f icat ion of  Verbal  Semant icAttributesAs mentioned in the preceding chapter, the resolution ofcertain types of zero pronouns that could not be dealt withby conventional methods, may now be resolved by usingsemantic information.
Therefore, in this chapter, the verbalsemantic attributes will be categorized for the purpose ofresolving zero pronouns using only linguistic knowledge(i.e.
not world knowledge), The referent of zero pronounswill be determined by the relationship between attributes.Japanese verbs will be categorized using the following 2viewpoints.Verb Categorization Standards?
Dynamic Characteristics of VerbsCategorization based on the inherent concepts of verbsand the reaction brought about o discourse situation bythe verbsEx.
"motsu"(to have) --- Possession"kaihatsusuru"(to develop) --- Production?
Relationship of Verbs to CasesEx.
"kanseisuru":SUBJ becompleted->SUBJ be produced"kaihatsusuru":SUBJ develop OBJ->SUBJ produce OBJThe conceptual system of verbs as categorized by thesestandards i shown in Figure 1.Next, we consider the relationship between verbs, byexamining the information regarding the relationshipswithin sentences containing zero pronouns and assesswhether this information will be furnished anew to sentencescontaining the referent.
The verbal semantic attribute (VSA)between verbs governing the referent and the verb governingthe zero pronoun can be summarized in the form shown inTable 2.
The use of this relationship will make it possibleto make an assumption of verbal relationship and todetermine the referential e ements of zero pronouns based onthe relationship of the two factors of verbal semanticattributes.As mention,ed in Chapter 3, the first sentence of the leadparagraph in a newspaper article often consists of adiscourse structure that presents an outline of the contents ofthe entire article.
Here, we shall refer to a unit sentence ofthis type as a "topicalized unit sentence", and based on itssemantic attributes, the referents of zero pronouns insentences that follow will be selected.By relying on the categorization of verbal semanticattributes, and observing the rules for determining thereferential elements of zero pronouns as described by itsattribute value, we find that it is possible to describe multi-purpose anaphora resolution analysis rules which do not relyon the target domain of the analysis.
Thus because, theinformation that is required for analysis is contained withinthe scope of linguistic knowledge, anaphora resolution elzero pronouns using this method can be applied to machinetranslation.EVENTi - - '1SUBJ  exist2 SUBJ not  ex is t  EX lStance /ATTRibuteABSTracti RELat ion  POSSession--STATE ~ RELat ionPERCEPtual STateMENTalSTate EMOTive STateNATURe THINKing STateI ' -1 from SUBJ to 01-Phys ica l  TRANSfer ~ SUBJ TRANS 0BJPOSSessive r -  1 SUBJ accepted-- PHYSical - - TRANSfer - -  2 SUBJ provides OBJ2ACTion ATTRibute- TRANSfer .

.Table 2 Rules for Determining Resolution Elementsby Verbal Semantic Categories2045 Format of Anaphorai  Resolution5.1 AlgorithmThe structure of the system for resolution of zero pronounsusing verbal semantic attributes i  shown in Figure 2.
TheJapanese sentence to be analyzed has already undergonemorphological nalysis, syntactic/semantic analysis, and theresults are input to context analysis.
In context analysis,anaphora resolution of zero pronouns is conducted asfollows.
(Step 1) --Detection of zero pronouns.If they exist, examine whether there are referentswithin the same sentence.If they exist, and resolution is concluded, proceedto Stcp 4Resolution of referents within the same sentence relies ontwo types of methods.1) Anaphoral resolution of zero pronouns based on the typeof conjunction2) Anaphoral resolution based onverbal semantic attributesThe f irst method usesconstraints where anaphoralelements determine the syntacticstructure depending on the type ofpostpositional particle and ofconjunctions.
A portion of therules for determining anaphoralelements depending on the type ofconjunctions is shown in Table3.
"to'(when)The second method is when, withinthe same sentence, anaphoralelements cannot be determinedbased on conjunctions (for example,when three or more types of unitsentences exist within the samesentence), anaphoral resolution isthen conducted using VSA.
(Step 2)--When they do not existwithin the samesentence,referent candidates are selected fromamong the case elements of topicalized unitsentences that are retained within the contextualinformation stage sector, The standard forselection will be based on the relationshipbetween VSA of verbs governed by zero pronounsand VSA of topicalized unit sentences and on therules for designating verbs given in Table 2.When constraints by verbs are satisfied, anaphoralrelationships become valid and proceed to Step 4.
(Step 3)--When the referent cannot be detected, handle as"processing impossible".Based on the semantic restrictions imposed on thezero pronoun by the verbs, conjecture anaphoralelements.
(Step 4)--From the knowledge base for sentence structurecontrol, use the rules for extraction of topicalizedunit sentences determined by relying on thesentence structure of target field of analysis 1 toselect the topicalized unit sentence and have thecontext information retaining sector retain thesentence.Proceed to the next sentence.Sentence Structure Control \] \]I(no,ledge base I IRule~o~%a~r~ez'i?in' ~ \[ IVerbal Semantic Information?

"Tooicalized Unit Sentence:(introduce (VSA (POSS-TRANS2 & START))(SUBJ "NTI")(OBJ "new model switchboard"))1In the case of newspaper articles, the first sentence in thearticle becomes the topicalized unit sentence.
When the firstsentence consists of a number of unit sentences, et an order ofpriority for the topicalized unit sentence depending on the typeof conjunction used.
Specifically, in the case of compoundsentences, rules such as the main sentence taking precedencewill be applied205~subj jiko-shindan-kinou wo wusai,self checking function OBJ equip"The new model switchboard is equipped with a selfchecking function and"(equip (VSA (POSS))(SUBJ eSUBJ) (OBJ "self checking function"))~SUBJ= "new model switchboard"~subj 200-shisutemu wo secchi-suru yotei-da.200 systems OBJ install be-planning-to"NTT is planning to install 200 systems.

In example (7), thefirst sentence is structured from the unit sentence and theresult of analysis is stored in the context information storagesector as the topicalized unit sentence.
Next, from theanalysis results of the second sentence, it can be understoodthat the subjects of "tousaisuru (is outfitted with or equippedwith)" and "yoteida (is planning to)" have been converted tozero pronouns.
Since there are no referents within the samesentence, the case element within the topicalized unitsentence becomes the referent candidate.
The VSA of"tousaisuru" and "yoteida" are respectively, "POSS","THINK-ACT", and the VSA of topicalized unit sentenceverb are "POSS-TRANS2" and "START".
Thus, accordingto the rules given in Table 2, "Detailed explanation" and"Policy decision" are established as the verbal semanticrelationships and the object and subject of the topicalizedunit sentence respectively, and become the referents.6 Implementation in a Machine TranslationSystemThe following is an outline of the processing undertaken bythe Japanese to English machine translation system, ALT-J/E (See Figure 3).
First, a morphological nalysis of theinput Japanese sentence is conducted, followed by adependency analysis of elements in the sentence.
Unitsentences 2 are extracted based on results of the relationshipsbetween verbs, and from these a simple unit sentence 3 isextracted.
Subjective expression information such as2a unit sentence is a part of the sentence in which the treestructure is centered around one predicate in the sentence; thereare occasions when embedded sentences are included in a unitsentence.3a simple unit sentence is one where a unit sentence has beenparsed to the level where it has only one predicate..(Ex.
(in English)"This is the only paper that contains the news" <- unit sentence"This is the only paper", "the only paper contains the news"<- simple unit sentences )modality, tense and aspect is extracted from the simple unitsentence to yield the objective simple unit sentence.
Thisobjective simple unit sentence, as shown in Figure 4, iscollated with two types of pattern dictionaries havingpredicates as index words (the idiomatic expression transferdictionary and the semantic valentz pattern transferdictionary).
When there is no appropriate pattern, a generalpattern transfer rule is applied.
This determines the syntacticand semantic structure pattern that is used in Japanese toEnglish conversion.

If numerous interpretations remain at this point,a single and final interpretation is decided on, based on theresults of interpretation of the pattern at the objective simpleunit sentence level.
Also, as seen in (1) and (7) of Chapter2, when there is a wide difference between the structures inJapanese and English, converting the Japanese structureresulting from analysis to a structure as close as possible tothe English expression can make it possible to avoidreferential analysis; only the zero pronouns that are used inthe English translation need to be treated.
If, after theforegoing analysis, zero pronouns still remain, anaphoraresolution using the context is conducted as shown inChapter 5.
At this stage, the sentence pattern used ingenerating the unit sentence is established and all thatremains is to use this to generate the backbone xpression inEnglish, adding other relevant information such as modality,tense and conjunction.
In doing so, care should be taken toavoid the situation where extracting zero pronouns aftercorrespondence analysis results in verbose English.
In thiscase elliptical pronouns and definite articles should be used.7.
Eva luat ionThe 102 sentences from 29 newspaper articles' leadparagraphs, as introduced in Chapter 3, were used as targetsentences; the results of  processing zero pronouns,appearances, and rate of resolution in analysis, are shown inTable 4.

SummaryThis paper has suggested a powerful method for anaphoralresolution using VSA to deal with the zero pronounsappearing in Japanese texts.
With previously suggestedmethods, it was difficult to realize pronominal resolution ofzero pronouns in a practical translation system due to thehuge volume of knowledge necessary (common sense andworld knowledge).
In contrast, he proposed method, whichutilizes semantic attributes of categorized verbs, makes itunnecessary todescribe rules unique to various fields.
Witha comparatively imited volume of knowledge, it is thuspossible to anaphorically resolve zero pronouns.
Thismethod has been realized in the machine translation systemALT-J/E.
ALT-J\]E was assessed by processing commonJapanese newspaper articles.
It was found that 93% of theJapanese zero pronouns requiring anaphoral resolution hadtheir referents determined correctly.One possible application of this method in contextprocessing would be to generate an abridged text based on astructural analysis of sentences in the entire article andcategorization of contents of the articles focusing on theVSA of the fwst sentence in each text.In this report, the target sentences were limited tonewspaper article lead paragraphs and comparatively shortsentences.
In the future, studies need to be made on changesin topic and sentences with a complicated iscoursestructure.ReferencesSusumu Kuno.
