Automatic extraction of subcorpora based on subcategorizationframes from a part-of-speech tagged corpusSusanne GAHLUC Berkeley, Department of LinguisticsICSI1947 Center St, Suite 600Berkeley, CA 94704-1105gahl@icsi.berkeley.eduAbstractThis paper presents a method for extractingsubcorpora documenting different subcate-gorization frames for verbs, nouns, andadjectives in the 100 mio.
word BritishNational Corpus.
The extraction tool consistsof a set of batch files for use with the CorpusQuery Processor (CQP), which is part of theIMS corpus workbench (cf.
Christ 1994a,b).A macroprocessor has been developed thatallows the user to specify in a simple input filewhich subcorpora re to be created for a givenlemma.The resulting subcorpora can be used (1) toprovide evidence for the subcategorizationproperties of a given lemma, and to facilitatethe selection of corpus lines for lexicographicresearch, and (2) to determine the frequenciesof different syntactic ontexts of each lemma.IntroductionA number of resources are available forobtaining subcategorization i formation, i.e.information on the types of syntacticcomplements associated with valence-bearingpredicators (which include verbs, nouns, andadjectives).
This information, also referred toas valence information is available both inmachine-readable form, as in the COMLEXdatabase (Macleod et al 1995), and in human-readable dictionaries (e.g.
Hornby 1989,Procter 1978, Sinclair 1987).
Increasingly,tools are also becoming available for acquiringsubcategorization i formation from corpora,i.e.
for inferring the subcategorization framesof a given lemma (e.g.
Manning 1993).None of these resources provide immediateaccess to corpus evidence, nor do they provideinformation on the relative frequency of thepatterns that are listed for a given lemma.There is a need for a tool that can (1) findevidence for subcategorization patterns and(2) determine their frequencies in largecorpora:1.
Statistical approaches to NLP rely oninformation not just on the range ofcombinatory possibilities of words, butalso the relative frequencies of theexpected patterns.2.
Dictionaries that list subcategorizationframes often list expected patterns, ratherthan actual ones.
Lexicographers andlexicologist need access to the evidencefor this information.3.
Frequency information has come to bethe focus of much psycholinguisticresearch on sentence processing (see forexample MacDonald 1997).
Whileinformation on word frequency is readilyavailable (e.g.
Francis and Kucera(1982)), there is as yet no easy way ofobtaining information from large corporaon the relative frequency of complemen-tation patterns.None of these points argue against the use-fulness of the available resources, but theyshow that there is a gap in the available in-formation.To address this need, we have developed a toolfor extracting evidence for subcategorizationpatterns from the 100 mio.
word BritishNational Corpus (BNC).
The tool is used aspan of the lexicon-building process in theFrameNet project, an NSF-funded projectaimed at creating a lexical database based onthe principles of Frame Semantics (Fillmore1982).4281 Infrastructure1.1 Too lsWe are using the 100 mio.
word BritishNational Corpus, with the following corpusquery tools:?
CQP (Corpus Query Processor, Christ(1994)), a general corpus query processorfor complex queries with any number andcombination of annotated informationtypes, including part-of-speech tags,morphosyntactic tags, lemmas andsentence boundaries.?
A macroprocessor for use with CQP thatallows the user to specify whichsubcorpora re to be created for a givenlemma.The corpus queries are written in the CQPcorpus query language, which uses regularexpressions over part-of-speech tags, lemmas,morphosyntactic tags, and sentenceboundaries.
For details, see Christ (1994a).The queries essentially simulate a chunkparser, using a regular grammar.1 .2  CoverageA list of the verb frames that are currentlysearchable is given in figure 1 below, alongwith an example of each pattern.
Thecategories we are using are roughly based onthose used in the COMLEX syntacticdictionary (Macleod et al 1995).intransitive 'worms wiggle'np 'kiss me'np_np 'brought her flowers'np_pp 'replaced it with a new one'np_Pvping 'prevented him from leaving'np_pwh 'asked her about what it allmeant'np_vpto 'advised her to go'np_vping 'kept them laughing'np_sfin 'told them (that) he was back'np_wh 'asked him where the moneyWas'np_ap 'considered him foolish'np_sbrst 'had him clean up'ap 'turned blue'figure 1: searchableIn our queries for nouns and adjectives astargets, we are able to extract prepositional,clausal, infinitival, and gerundial complements.In addition, the tool accomodates searches forcompounds and for possessor phrases (myneighbor's addiction to cake, my milk allergy).Even though these categories are not tied tothe syntactic subcategorization frames of thetarget lemmas, they often instantiate semanticarguments, or, more specifically, Frameelements (Fillmore 1982, Baker et alforthcoming).1 .3  Method1.3.1 OverviewWe start by creating a subcorpus containing allconcordance lines for a given lemma.
We callthis subcorpus a lemma-subcorpus.
Theextraction of smaller subcorpora from thelemma subcorpus then proceeds in two stages.During the first stage, syntactic patternsinvolving 'displaced' arguments (i.e.
'leftisolation' or 'movement' phenomena) areextracted, such as passives, tough movementand constructions involving WH-extraction.The result of this procedure is a set ofsubcorpora that are homogeneous with respectto major constituent order.
Following this, theremainder of the lemma-subcorpus ispartitioned into subcorpora based on thesubcategorization properties of the lemma inquestion.PPPP-PPPvpingPwhintrans, part.np_particleparticle_pp:particle_wh:vpingsfinsbrstvptodirectquoteadverbcomplement'look at the picture''turned from a frog into aprince''responded by nodding herhead''wonder about how ithappened''touch down', 'turn over''put the dishes away','put away the dishes''run off with it''figured out how to get there''needs fixing''claimed (that) it was over''demanded (that) he leave''agreed to do it over''no, said he', '"no", 'he said','he said: "no"''behave badly'types for verbs4291.3.2 Search strategies: positive and negativequeriesFor the extraction of certain subcategorizationpatterns, it is not necessary to simulate a parseof all of the constituents.
Where an explicitcontext cue exists, a partial parse suffices.
Forexample, the query given in figure 2 below isused to find \[_ NP VPing\] patterns (e.g.
keptthem laughing).
Note that the query does notpositively identify a noun phrase in the~osition followinencoding\[$search_b,,\]\[pos!="V.*lCJCICJSICJTIPRFIPRPIPUN"\] { 1,5}\[pos ="VVGIVBGIVDGIVHG"\]within s;verb.descriptiontarget lemmagerundexamplekeptthemcomingwithin asentencefigure 2: A query for \ [NP  VPing\]1.3.3Searches driven by subcategorizationframesApplying queries like the one for \[NP VPing\]"blindly", i.e.
in the absence of anyinformation on the target lemma, wouldproduce many false hits, since the query alsomatches gerunds that are not subcategorized.However, the information that the target verbsubcategorizes for a gerund dramaticallyreduces the number of such errors.The same mechanism is used for addressingthe problems associated with prepositionalphrase attachment.
The general principle isthat prepositional phrases in certain contextsare considered to be embedded in a precedingnoun phrase , unless the user specifies that agiven preposition is subcategorized for by thetarget lemma.
For example, the of-phrase in asequence Verb - NP - of-  NP is interpreted aspart of the first NP (as in met the president ofthe company), unless we are dealing with averb that has a \[_NP PPof\] subcategorizationframe, e.g.
cured the president of his asthma.1.3.4 Cascading queriesThe result of each query is subtracted from thelemma subcorpus and the remainder submittedto the next set of queries.
As a result, earlierqueries pre-empt later queries.
For example,concordance lines matching the queries forpassives, e.g.
he was cured of his asthma arefiltered out early on in the process, so as toavoid getting matched by the queries dealingwith (active intransitive) verb + prepositionalphrase complements, such as he boasted of hisachievements.Another example of this type of preemptionconcerns the interaction of the query forditransitive frames (brought her flowers) withlater queries for NP complements.
A propername immediately followed by anotherproper name (e.g.
Henry James) is interpretedas a single noun phrase except when the targetlemma subcategorizes for a ditransitive frame t.An analogous trategy is used for identifyingnoun compounds.
For ditransitives, trings thatrepresent wo consecutive noun phrases arequeried for first.
Note that this methodcrucially relies on the fact that thesubcategorization properties of the targetlemma are given as the input to the queryprocess.2 Examples2 .1  NPsAn example of a complex query expression ofthe kind we are using is given in figure 3.
Theexpression matches noun phrases like "thethree kittens", "poor Mr. Smith", "all three","blue flowers", "an unusually large hat", etc.

The text files are5 Limitations of the approachOur tool relies on subcategorization i forma-tion as its input.
Hence it is not capable ofautomatically learning subcategorizationframes, e.g.
ones that are missing in diction-2 Our macroprocessor was developed by Collin Baker (ICSI-Berkeley) and Douglas Roland (U of Colorado, Boulder).431aries or omitted in the input file.
The toolfacilitates the (manual) discovery of evidencefor new subcategorization frames, however, aspotential complement patterns are saved inseparate subcorpora.
Indeed, this is one of theways in which the tool is being used in thecontext of the FrameNet project.Some of the technical imitations of the exist-ing tools result from the fact that we areworking with an unparsed corpus.
Thus, manytypes of 'null' or 'empty' constituents 3 are notrecognized by the queries.
Ambiguities inprepositional phrase attachment are anothermajor source of errors.
For instance, of theconcordance lines supposedly instantiating a\[_NP PPwith\] frame for the verb heal, severalin fact contained embedded PPs (e.g.
\[_NP\], asin heal \[children with asthma\], rather than\[_NP PPwith\], as in healing \[arthritis\] \[with acrystal ball\]),Finally, the search results can only be as accu-rate as the part-of-speech tags and other an-notations in the corpus.7 Future directionsFuture versions of the tool will includesearches for predicative (vs. attributive) usesfor adjectives and nouns.
For verbs, thesearches will be expanded to cover the entireset of complementation patterns described inthe COMLEX syntactic dictionary.ConclusionWe have presented an overview of a set of toolsfor extracting corpus lines illustrating subcate-gorization patterns of nouns, verbs, and adjec-tives, and for determining the frequency ofthese patterns.
The tools are currently used aspart of the FrameNet project.
