UTILIZING DOMAIN-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR PROCESSING COMPACT TE~TElaine MarshL lngu ls t l c  Str ing ProjectNee York Univers i tyNee York, Nee YorkABSTRACTThis paper Ident i f ies  the types of sentencefragments found In the text  of two domains: medicalrecords and Navy equipment status messages.
Thefragment types are re lated to fu l l  sentence formson the basis of the elements which were regu lar lydeleted.
A breakdown of the fragment types andthe i r  d i s t r ibut ions  In the two domains Ispresented.
An approach to reconstruct ing thesemantic class of deleted elements In the medicalrecords Is proposed which is based on the semanticpatterns recognized In the domain.I.
INTRODUCTIONA large amount of natural language Input,whether to text processing or questlon-answerlngsystems, conslsts of shortened sentence forms,sentence nfragmentsn.
Sentence fragments are foundin informal technical communlcatlons, messages,headlines, and In te legraphic  camunlcat lons.Occurrences are characterized by the l r  brev l ty  andInformational nature.
In a l l  of these, i f  peopleare not res t r i c ted  to using complete, grammaticalsentences, as they are In formal wr i t ings i tuat ions ,  they tend to leave OUt the parts of thesentence which they bel leve the reader w i l l  be ableto reconstruct.
Thls is especia l ly  true i f  thewr i te r  deals wlth a special ized subject matterwhere the facts are to be used by others in thesame f ie ld .Several approaches to such hi l l - formed,,natural language Input have been fol lowed.
TheLIFER system \[Hendrlx, 1977; Hendrlx, et a i .
,  1978\]and the I~_ANES system \[Waltz, 1978\] both accountfor fragments In procedural terms; they Co notrequire the user to enumerate the types offragments which w i l l  be accepted.
The L ingu is t i cStrlng Project has characterlzed the regular lyoccurring ungrammatical constructions and made thempert of the parsing grammar \[Anderson, et e l .
,1975; Hlrschman and Sager, 1982\].
Kwasny andSondhe!mer (10R1) have used error-handl ingprocedures to re late  the I l l - formed input ofsentence fragments to well-formed structures.While these approaches d i f fe r  in the way theydetermine the structure of the fragments and thedeleted mater ia l ,  for the most pert they relyheavi ly,  at some point,  on the recognit ion ofsemantic word-classes.
The purpose of th is  paperIs to describe the syntact ic  character is t ics  ofsentence fragments and to l l l us t ra te  how thedomeln-speclf lc Information embodied In thecooCcurrence patterns of the semantic word-classesof a domain can be u t i l i zed  as a powerful tool forprocessing a body of compact text ,  I .e.
tex t  thatcontains a large percentage of sentence fragments,I I .
IDENTIFICATION OF FRAGMENT TYPESThe Nee York Unlversl~y L ingu is t i c  Str ingProject  has developed a computer program to analyzeccmpact text In special Ized subject areas using ageneral parsing program and an Engl Ish grammaraugmented by procedures spec l f l c  to  the subJectareas.
In recent years the system has beenta i lo red  for  computer analysis of f ree - text  medicalrecords, which are characterized by numeroussentence fragments.
In the computer-analysis andprocessing of the medical records, re la t lve ly  fewtypes of sentence fragments suff lced to describethe shortened forlas, a l though such fragmentsccmprfsed fu l l y  49% of the natural language inputCMarsh and Sager, 1982\].
Fragment types can bere lated to fu l l  forms on the basis of the elementswhich are regular ly  delirfed.
Elements deleted fr~nthe fragments are fr~a one or more of the syntact icpos l t lons:  subject,  tense, verb, obJect.
The s ixfragment types Ident l f led  in the set of medicalrecords are shown In Table 1 as types i -V l .A feature of fragment types that Is notImed la te ly  obvious ts the fact  that they arealready known In the ful I grammar as parts offul l e t  construct ions.
The fragment types re f lec tdelet ions found in syntact i ca l l y  dist inguishedposit ions wlth in fu l l  sentences, as I l l us t ra ted  inTable 2.
For e~ample, In normal English, a sentencethat contains tense and the verb be can occur asthe object  of verbs l i ke  f ind (e.g.
She found thatthe sent~ce was ~ ) .
In the sameenvironment, as obJect of f ind,  a reduced sentencecan occur \[n which the tense and verb be have beenomitted, as In fragment type I (e.g.
She found thesentence ~ l l l J ;~) .
In the same manner, otherreduced forms ref lected in fragment types alsorepresent constructions general ly found as ~arts ofregular English sentences.The fact  that the fragment types can bere lated to fu l l  English forms makes I t  possible tov Iee thee as Instances of reducedSURJECT-VEI~-(~JECT patterns free which par t i cu la rcomponents have been deleted.
Fragments of type Ican be represented as having a deleted tense andverb be, of type II as having a deleted subject,tense, and verb be, etc.
This makes it relativelystra ightforward to add thee to the parslng grammar,99!i !

When the fragment typesfound In medical records were compared wlth thoseseen In a smell sample of Navy equipment statusmessages, f i ve  of the s lx  types found in themedlcal records were also found In the Navymessages.
Only one addit ional  fragment type wasrequired to cover the Navy messages.
This typeappears In Table I as type Vll, in which twosubjects have been deleted (Reauest advisefor Dick ~Q.
).While the number of fragment types Isre la t ive ly  constant, the d i s t r ibut ion  of fragmenttypes varies according to the domain of the text .Table 3 shows d i s t r ibut ions  for each of thefragment types Ident i f ied  in Table 1.
For e~ample,In Table 3, while fragment type IV, from whichsubject, tense, and verb have been deleted, is mostfrequent In medical records, I t  is a much lessfrequent type In the Navy messages.
On the otherhand, type VI, from whlch a subject has beendeleted, Is re la t ive ly  Infrequent In medicalrecords, but much more frequent in Navy messages.In addit ion,  the d i f fe rent  sections of theinput d i f fe r  with respect to the ra t io  of fragments1-o whole sentences and in the types of fro~ments101they contain.
For e~unple, the d i f fe rent  sectionsof the medical records that  were analyzed (e.g.HISTORY, EXAM, LAB-DATA, IMPRESSION, COURSE INHOSPITAL) were dist inguished by differences in thed i s t r ibut ion  of the fragment types.
The EXAMparagraph of the medical texts ,  In which thephysician describes the resu l ts  of the pat ient ' sphysical  eK~lnat lon ,  contained a relatively largenumber of fragments of type I11, espec ia l lyadjective phrases.
The COURSE IN HOSPITALparagraph contained a larger number of completesentences than the other paragraphs.TABLE \] .

RECONSTRUCTION OF DELETIONSThe de let ions  which re la te  fragment types tothe i r  fu l l  sentence forms fa l l  Into two mainclasses:  ( I )  those found v i r tua l ly  In a l l  tex ts  andI l l )  those spec l f l c  to the domain of the text .Just as the fragment types can be viewed asIncomplete rea l i za t ions  of syntac-Nc S-V-Os t ruc tures ,  the semantic pat terns  In sentencefragments can be considered Incomplete rea l l za t lonsof the semantic S-V-O pat terns .
In general terms,the s t ruc ture  of Informat ion In technical  domainscan be spec i f ied  by a set  of semantlc c lasses,  thewords and phrases which belong to  these classes,and by a spec l f l ca t lon  of the pal'~erns theseclasses enter  in'to, l .e .
the syntact i cre la t ionsh ips  among the members of +he classes\[Grlshmen, e t  e l .
,  1982; Sager, 1978\].
In +he caseof the medical sublenguage processed by theL lngu ls t l c  StTlng Pro jec t ,  the medical subclasseswere der lved through techniques of d i s t r ibut iona lana lys is  \[Hlrschmen and Sager, 1982\].
SemantlcS-V-O pet-I'erns were then der ived from thecomblnatory proper t ies  of the medical classes inthe text  \[Marsh and Sager, 1982\]; +he semanticpat~rerns Ident i f ied  In a text  are spec i f i c  to  thedomain of +he text .
Whlle they serve to formulatesublanguage const ra in ts  which ru le  out  incor rec tsyntact i c  analyses caused by s t ruc tura l  or l ex lca lambiguity/, these re la t ionsh ips  among classes cana lso prov ide a means by which deleted elements incompact text  can be reconstructed.
When a fragmentIs recognized as an Instance of a given semanticpat tern ,  I t  Is +hen poss ib le  to speci fy  a set  ofthe semantic classes from which the medicalsublanguage class of +he deleted element can beselected.On a super f l c la l  l eve l ,  the de le t ions  of be Infragment types Ic - f  and I l i a -b ,  for  example, can bereconstructed on purely  syntac~'lc grounds byf l l l l ng  In the l exical  Item be.
However, I t  Isa lso poss ib le  to prov ide fu r ther  Informat ion andspeci fy  the semantic class of the lex lcal Item beby reference to the semantlc S-V-O pat-ternmanifested by the occurr ing subject  and ob jec t .For e~emple, In type If fragment skin no ~ruot lons,skin has the medical subclass BODYPART, anderunt lons  has +he medlcal subclass SIGN/SYMFrrOM.The semantic S-V-O pat-tern In which these classesplay a par t  Is=BODYPART-SHOWVERB-SIGN/SYMPTOM(as In Skln showed no erunt lons ) .
Be can then beassigned the semantic c lass SHOWVERB.
p ro te in  ~,type I t ,  enters Into the semantic pal-~ern:TEST-~STVERB-TES13~ESULTand be can be assigned the class TESI~/ERB, whichre la tes  a TEST sub ject  wl th  a TESllRESULT ob jec t .Assigning a semantic c lass to  the reconstructed bemaximizes I ts  In format ional  content .In add i t ion  to  reconst ruct ing  a d l s t lngu lshedl ex lca l  Item, l i ke  +he verb be, along with  I tssemantic c lasses,  I t  Is a lso  poss ib le  to  spec i fythe set  of semantic classes for  a deleted element,even +hough a l ex lca l  Item Is not Immediatelyreconst ructab le .
For e~emple, the fragment Torecelv9 fo l l c  ~,J.~o of Type VI,  conta ins a verb ofthe PI~/ERB" c lass and a MEDICATION-obJect, but thesub ject  has b~n de leted.
The only semanticpad-tern which permits a verb and ob jec t  wl th  thesemedical subclasses Is the S-V-O pat tern :PATIENT-PTVERB-MEDICATIONThrough recogn{t lon  of the semantic pat tern  inwhich +he occurr ing elements of the fragment play aro le ,  the semantic c lass PATIENT can be spec i f iedfo r  +he deleted sub ject ,  p~t lent  Is one of thed i s t ingu ished  words In the domain of nar ra t ivemedical records which are o f ten not exp l i c i t l ymentloned In the text ,  although they play a ro le  Inthe sementlc pat terns .The S-V-O re la t ions ,  of which the fragmenti~/pes are Incomplete rea l i za t ions ,  form the basisof a procedure which spec i f ies  the semantic c lassesof de leted elements In fragments.
Under the bestcond i t ions ,  the set  of semantic classes fo r  thedeleted form conta ins only one element.
I t  Is a lsoposs ib le ,  however, for  the set to conta in  more thanone semantic c lass.
For example, the t~fpe lafragment Pain also noted }n hands ~ knees, whenregu lar i zed  to normal ac t ive  S-V-O word order  asnoted oaln In hands and knees, has a de letedsub ject .
The set of poss ib le  medical classes forthe deleted subject  cons ists  of ~PATIENT, FAMILY,OocrrOR}, s ince ?
fragment wi th  a verb of theOBSERVE c lass,  such as note, and an ob jec t  of theSIGN/SYMPTOM class,  such as oaln,  can enter  ~rtcSUBJECT VERB OBJECTFAMILY OBSERVE SIGN/SYMPTOMPATIENT OBSERVE SIGN/SYMPTOMDOCTOR OBSERVE SIGN/SYMPTOM(MO~ ~SERV~ F~ER.

EXN~IPLES OF SUBJECT-VERB-CBJECT PAl-FERNS102any of the S-V-O patterns In F igure I ,  The choiceof one subclass for  the deleted element from amongelements of the set of poss ib le  subclasses Isdependent on several factors .
F i r s t ,  proper t ies  ofparagraph s t ructure  of the text  place res t r i c t ionson the se lect ion  of semantic class for  a deletedelement.
The fragment noted oaln In  h~ds  andknees would se lect  a DOCTOR subject I f  wr i t ten  Inthe IMPRESSION or EXAH paragraph of the text ,  but,In the HISTORY paragraph, a PATIENT or FAMILYsubJect could not be excluded.
A second fac tor  Isthe presence of an antecedent having one of thesemantic classes spec i f ied fo r  the deleted element.I f  a poss ib le  antecedent having the same sGmsntlcclass can be found, subJect to  res t r l c t lons  onchange of top ic  and discourse s t ruc ture ,  then thedeleted element can be f i l l ed  In by Its antecedent,res t r i c t ing  the sementlc class of the deletedelement to that  of the antecedent.
Hoaever, anantecedent search may not always be successful ,s ince the antecedent may not have been exp l l c \ [ t l ymentioned In the text .
The antecedent may be oneof a class of d is t inguished words In thesublanguage, such as nat lent  and .
~ ,  which maynot be previous ly  mentioned In the body of thetext .Thus, semantic patterns der ived fromd ls t r lbut \ [ona l  analys is  permit  the spec i f i ca t ion  ofa set of semantic classes for  deleted elements Intexts  cheracter lzed by a large propor t ion  ofsentence fragments.
This spec l f l ca t lon  canfac i l i ta te  the reconstrucf fon of deleted elementsby l im i t ing  choice among poss ib le  antecedents.IV.
CONCLUSIONIn th i s  paper, seven de le t ion  patterns foundIn technical  compact text  have been Ident i f ied .The number of fragment types Is re la t ive ly  l im i ted .F ive of the seven occur In the fu l l  grammar ofEnglish as subparts of fu l le r  s t ructures .
Thesesyntact i c  fragment types can be vlewed asIncomplete rea l i za t ions  of syntact i cSUBJ ECT-VERB-ORJECT s t ructures ;  the semanticpatterns In sentence fragments are found to beIncomplete rea l l za t lons  of the semanticSUBJECT-VER\]-OBJECT pal-ferns found In fu l lsentences.
Semantic classes can be spec l f led fordeleted elements In sentence fragments based onthese semantic patterns.AC~N~/L EDGIqENTSThls research was supported In part  byNational Science Foundatlon grant  numberIS1-/9-20788 frcm the D iv is ion  of InformationScience and Technology, and in part  by NationalL ibrary  of Hedlclne grant  number 1-RO1-LM03953awarded by the National Ins t i tu te  of Health,Oepert~ent of Health and Human Servlces.REFERENCESAnderson, B.,  Bross, I .O.
