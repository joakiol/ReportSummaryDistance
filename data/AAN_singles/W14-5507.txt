We thusspeculate that RBMT (Rule Based Machine Translation) can fill the gap for these languages.1 IntroductionIn this paper, we present an ongoing work that aims at assessing the relevance of specific methods to reach?quick and quality?
machine translation for under-resourced languages.
These methods include working inparallel  on several  languages,  reusing software and linguistic  resources,  relying on a  pivot  architecture,opening our linguistic sources and letting any group of users the possibility to ?do it themselves?.
We alsochose to adopt the old fashioned RBMT approach.More  concretely,  we  are  applying  Vauquois?
methodology  [Vauquois  and  Chappuy,  1985]  to  thedevelopment of analysers for Khmer, Lao, Thai and Hindi, which we plan to ?connect?
to existing and opensource syntheses of French and English through three means: deep transfer, deep hybrid transfer and UNLpivot representation.
In order to elaborate easy-to-understand guidelines for new comers, we chose to createa primer methodological step involving the small novel of Saint-Exup?ry ?The Little Prince?, which hasbeen translated into 270 languages and dialects.
Doing so, the principles for developing dictionaries andgrammars that follow Vauquois?
methodology become much simpler to understand.2 Tools and methodology2.1 The Heloise RBMT frameworkThe RBMT framework we are using is calledHeloise.
It  has  been  presented  at  COLING2012 [Berment and Boitet, 2012].
Heloise is anonline  environment  available  to  anyonewishing to design his or her own operationalexpert  MT  system,  especially  for  under-resourced  pairs  of  languages.
It  is  upward-compatible with Ariane-G5?s languages, so theopen-source  modules  developed  under  thisenvironment can be reused in any new system.For example, in order to add a new languageX, an existing generation of French languagecan  be  taken  as  such  for  a  new  X-Frenchsystem,  limiting  the  effort  to  an  analyser  oflanguage X and to a transfer from X to French.Figure 1 represents the usual phases involvedin a development under Ariane-G5.FIGURE 1 ?

The abstractrepresentation is a multi-level structure (m-structure) ideally containing the logic (predicate-argument) andsemantic data that are the most language-independent computed in this approach.
As this deep level is notalways reached, two other (lower) levels are borne by the m-structure: the syntagmatic level and the syntacticdependency level, so the translation system will output the best it can do.As one can see in Figure 1, the development is made of modules corresponding to the different steps of thetranslation.
If we concentrate on the analysis (the systems we are working on are X-French and X-Englishsystems  so  firstly  on  analysers  for  the  X  languages),  the  work  consists  in  developing  monolingualdictionaries containing all the information necessary for the analysis, as well as structural analysers.
As suchlinguistic descriptions are rather complex, one first needs to specify what will be programmed, especially forthe structural part.
G?TA?s answer to this issue consists in making a list of the different structural phenomenafound in the language, each one being represented as a correspondence between a string and its abstractrepresentation (?charts?
), and establishing links between the charts so the charts can include references toother charts.
One can think it roughly as derivation rules in formal grammars in which terminal elements areclasses of words and non-terminal elements are charts.
For example, a noun phrase (the string) such as[adjective+noun] can be represented as NP(AP,noun) where AP refers to a chart of general adjective phrases,possibly containing adverbs as in ?a very cute cat?.
The formalism for those charts has initially been called?static grammar?
and later SCSG (Static Correspondence Specification Grammar).3 Parallel work on Khmer, Hindi, Lao and Thai languagesThis work aims at elaborating an efficient and simple methodology for developing MT systems for groups ofunder-resourced languages.
We are using for that purpose a small corpus consisting in Saint-Exup?ry?s LittlePrince in Khmer, Hindi, Lao and Thai which are our source languages, and our target languages are Frenchand English.
Two of the authors, Guillaume de Mal?zieux and Vincent Berment, are working on Khmer andLao, as two other persons, Jennifer Wong and Satenik Mkhitaryan, are working on Thai and Hindi.3.1 Reuse of existing linguistic modulesThe  systems  developed  under  Ariane-G5  are  made  of  linguistic  module  dedicated  to  each  step  of  thetranslation  process  (analysis,  transfer,  generation).
In  G?TA?s  approach,  analyses  are  independent  fromgenerations so an analyser for a specific language can be used with a generation of any other language.
AsFrench an English modules are available under BSD licence (among many others), we are using them for ourwork so the analysers and the transfers have to be developed.3.2 Segmentation and POS taggingIn the case of Khmer, Lao and Thai, one needs to segment into words first, as the writing systems do notinclude  spaces  between  words.
This  is  done  by  Motor,  a  segmenter  performing  a  maximum matchingalgorithm.
It is currently available for Burmese, Khmer, Lao, Thai and Tibetan.
Within the limits of our smallcorpus, the obtained segmentation is 100% correct (the figure reached for general corpora is significantlylower).
In order to create the first step called ?morphological analysis?
in Figure 1, we need a list of wordswith a number of features that will be used for the analysis.
To achieve that, we fill an Excel file with therequired  data.
The  following figure  is  an  extract  of  the  Excel  file  that  describe  a  noun phrase  with  apossessive attribution.
Note that Hindi is not completed and was not included is this paper.FIGURE 2 ?
Khmer, Lao and Thai data used in the ?morphological analysis?We  used  parts  of  speech  often  found  in  G?TA systems:  V  verb,  N  noun,  A adjunct,  R  pronoun,  S51subordination (preposition,  subordinating conjunction and linking word),  C coordinating conjunction.
InFigure 2, LU stands for Lexical Unit, which is a generalisation of lemma that groups together words derivingfrom the same base such as build, building, builder, etc.
That notion is very useful,  for example duringtransfers where it eases paraphrasing.The  example  in  Figure  2  is  an  ideal  casewhere  the  three  languages  involved  arealigned  word  for  word.
When  it  is  not  thecase, we have different lines for the parts inthe  different  languages  that  are  not  alignedand we mark them as ?similar?
thanks to acolour given to those parts.
That is used laterwhen  specifying  the  structural  analysers  asblocks  of  words  that  are  not  aligned  mayshare  common  structures  (see  the  nextsection).After the Excel file is completed, we can thengenerate  automatically  the  ?morphologicalanalysis?
source  code  written  in  ATEFlanguage, thanks to a tool we developed forthat  aim.
Note  that  segmenting  and  POStagging  have  their  own  dictionaries  so  aspecial  care  is  needed  to  ensure  theirconsistency.FIGURE 3 ?

(Khmer)3.3 Structural analysisIn order to perform the structural analysis of a text, one needs a formal description of the language.
Thisdescription,  that  we  call  a  specification,  will  be  written  according  to  the  formalism given  by  BernardVauquois  and Sylviane Chappuy [Vauquois  et  Chappuy,  1985]  and mentioned in  section  2.2:  the  staticgrammars.
After we get such specification, we can start programming the analyser in the Ariane-G5 languagecalled ROBRA, which performs tree transformations.Now let us have a closer look at what a static grammar is like.
It is a series of charts, each chart describing afamily of strings by associating it to a tree.
The charts may refer to each other.
For example in order torecognise a  complex noun phrase such as ?gaz reaction?,  the two nouns have to be first  recognised asseparate valid noun phrases (for example, ?gaz?
is a word that makes sense on its own) so that then they canbe gathered into the same tree in order to take a new meaning.
So that means the chart describing complexnoun phrases refers to the chart describing simple noun phrases.
As a consequence, all the charts have to beorganised in the grammar so that the ones describing elementary phrases, that are the ones that do not needreferring to another chart, come first.
Then come the charts describing simple phrases, because they can onlyrefer to lower charts in this hierarchy.
At last come the charts for complex groups, they can refer to any chartin the grammar.Now to write the charts, we need a list of variables to gather all the information we need.
They can be ofdifferent types, but for the purpose of our study, we will only need basic information.
Because we use thelimited vocabulary of the Little Prince, we won't have to work much on disambiguation.
So for now we areonly using POS information, with some refinements to recognise mass nouns from countable nouns, andsome subcategories  of verbs.
As an example,  we will  present  the  chart  describing  the possession nounphrases, that are built identically in the three languages: noun + particle ?of ?
+ personal pronoun.
Here inorder to write a chart that could apply to Lao, Thai and Khmer languages at a time, we will use the variableOF to refer to ????
in Khmer, ???
in Thai, and ???
in Lao.
A static chart is divided into three zones.
Thefirst  one  is  a  string-tree  correspondence,  describing  the structure  to  be recognised.
Each node and leafreceives a number.
In FIGURE 4, the root node of our noun phrase is the number 1.
Numbers 2, 3 and 4 arethe leaves, and each cross below represents a word of the string.
The square brackets around number 3 meanthat it is optional.
The last two lines at the bottom of the tree give information about the words.
For exampleleave 2 is a noun, and more precisely a common noun, leave 3 is a subordinating and its LU is the particleOF, and at last, leave 4 is a personal pronoun.
One particularity in this tree is the fact that the node 3 is not52linked to the root.
This is because although the particle needs to be taken into account during the analysis, wechose not to have it appear into the tree.
All the information it carries will be transferred into other nodes.Zone 2 of the static chart provides complementary information on the condition necessary for the structure tobe correct.
This could be semantic information on one of the nodes, or the presence of one node excludinganother, etc.
But we do not need any information of this type in the chart we are studying.
At last, it is inzone 3 that we present the actions to be taken on the tree.
In our case, we store in a variable the possessionrelation.
We also assign the noun of leave 2 to be the governor, that is to say the head, of the phrase.FIGURE 4 ?

Example of structural analysis for a Lao phrase3.4 Lexical transferIn transfers, we transform the Lexical Units and their variables from the source to the target lexical spaces.As we found lexical similarities between Thai, Lao and Khmer languages ?
ULs are between 50% and 70%common ?, a large part of the transfers is also common to those languages.4 ConclusionIn this paper, we presented an ongoing work.
A lot remains to be done but we already observe that workingin parallel  on several  languages brings a  lot of  advantage.
For example,  when a question raises  on themethodology, on how we can build a specific static chart, etc., people working on any language can answer.For  this  purpose,  the  Ariane/Heloise  community  has  set-up  a  Web  site  and  enriches  it  continuously:lingwarium.org.
Also, as for the structural phases, we noted that many structures were common betweenKhmer Lao and Thai (Hindi development is late because of the few common features shared with the otherlanguages), thus reducing the effort for making the static grammars.
We also noted that the time to developthe transfers were dramatically reduced as a large part of them were common to the three languages.
Thatremains to be further evaluated but we are already convinced it is a way that will help reaching ChristianBoitet?s prediction that 600 languages will have access to machine translation [Boitet, 2013].AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Jennifer Wong and Satenik Mkhitaryan for their contribution, as well as MichelAntelme who helped a lot for the work on the Khmer language.53ReferencesBachut  D.,  Le projet  EUROLANG :  une  nouvelle  perspective  pour  les  outils  d?aide  ?
