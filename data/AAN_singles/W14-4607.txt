Proceedings of the First Celtic Language Technology Workshop, pages 50?54,Dublin, Ireland, August 23 2014.Irish National Morphology Database: a high-accuracy open-sourcedataset of Irish wordsMichal Boleslav M?churaNew English-Irish Dictionary ProjectForas na GaeilgeDublin, Irelandmmechura@forasnagaeilge.ieAbstractThe Irish National  Morphology Database is  a  human-verified,  Official  Standard-compliantdataset containing the inflected forms and other morpho-syntactic properties of Irish nouns,adjectives, verbs and prepositions.
It is being developed by Foras na Gaeilge as part of theNew English-Irish Dictionary project.
This paper introduces this dataset and its accompanyingsoftware library Gramad?n.1 IntroductionThe Irish National Morphology Database is a side product of the New English-Irish Dictionary projectat Foras na Gaeilge.
During work on the dictionary, a requirement arose to include rich morphologicalinformation on the target (Irish) side of the dictionary.
It has been decided to build a separate morpho-logical dataset that translations in the dictionary would link to.
The result can be viewed at http://fo-cloir.ie/ where clicking a grammatical label next to a translation opens a window listing the inflec-ted forms and other morphological properties of the word.
The same data can also be viewed separ -ately at http://breis.focloir.ie/en/gram/.2 Database designThe Irish National Morphology Database has been compiled semi-automatically from several sourcesavailable to Foras na Gaeilge, including a machine-readable version of Focl?ir P?ca and grammaticaldata extracted from WinGl?acht and focal.ie.
All data resulting from this process have been proof-readand corrected by editors working on the New English-Irish Dictionary project.
Therefore, we describethe database as a high-accuracy dataset: it does not come with a known margin of error and it is meantto have normative force.
The language data complies with the Official Standard for Irish (An Caigh-de?n Oifigi?il 2012).At time of writing, the database contains 6,736 nouns, 983 adjectives, 1,239 verbs and 16 preposi-tions.
New entries are being added continuously.Each entry has a unique identifier consisting of the lemma followed by a grammatical label, such asbainis_fem2.
In cases where the grammatical label is not sufficient to distinguish between homonyms,the identifier contains a ?disambiguator?, such as gl?in_fem2_cos (the noun gl?in ?knee?
with pluralgl?ine) versus gl?in_fem2_aois (the noun gl?in ?generation?
with plural gl?nta).
The disambiguators(cos  ?leg?, aois ?age?)
are purely mnemotechnic: no attempt is being made to expose the semantics ofthe lemmas, only that two different lemmas exist with two different sets of inflected forms.The database structure allows for variation everywhere.
Every inflected form (for example, everycombination of case and number) is in essence a list of variants which can contain zero, one or moreThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Thus we can accommodate cases when the OfficalStandard allows for variation, such as the two genitives of talamh ?land?
(masculine talaimh and fem-inine  tal?n).
On the other hand, an empty list of variants implies the form does not exist (or is notknown), for example when a noun has no plural.The entries are encoded in XML.
Every entry comes in two shapes: a minimal format which con-tains the smallest necessary set of forms and properties, and an expanded format intended for present-ation to humans.
For example, in the case of nouns, the minimal entries contain only one form for eachnumber and case (e.g.
bainis ?wedding?
in singular nominative) while, in the expanded entry, these are?expanded?
to include definitiveness (bainis ?a wedding?,  an bhainis ?the wedding?).
The expandedentries are then transformed with XSL into HTML and displayed to human users.
The minimal entriesare intended as a machine-readable resource that can be re-used for other purposes in language techno-logy, such as for building spellcheckers or for query expansion in fulltext search.Minimal entries are converted into expanded entries using Gramad?n, a custom-built software lib-rary written in C#.
Gramad?n provides functions for performing grammatical operations such as initialmutations,  constructing  noun  phrases  from nouns  and  adjectives,  constructing  verb  phrases  fromverbs, and so on.
The process of converting a minimal entry into an expanded entry is in essence anexercise in natural language generation (where syntactic structures are serialized into strings),  andGramad?n is in essence a software library for natural language generation in Irish.2.1 NounsListing 1 shows a typical noun entry (abhainn ?river?
)1 in minimal format, Listing 2 shows the sameentry in expanded format.
Notice that each form (sgNom being singular nominative,  sgGen singulargenitive and so on) consists of a string (the default attribute) with form-specific properties: singularforms have gender while plural forms do not, the plural genitive has strength (a property which signalswhether the form is weak or strong).
Notice that we have decided to treat gender as a property of aword form, not a property of the whole lemma.
This makes it possible to deal with cases like talamh?land?
which has two singular genitives, one masculine and one feminine.2.2 AdjectivesListing 3 shows a typical adjective entry (b?n ?white?
)2 in minimal format, Listing 4 shows the sameentry in expanded format.
The forms of an adjective are less evenly distributed than those of a noun:there is one singular nominative, two singular genitives (for agreement with masculine and femininenouns) and only one plural form for all cases (the singular nominative is used for agreement withweak-plural genitive nouns).
This is sufficient information for Gramad?n to generate the forms neededfor agreement with all kinds of nouns in all numbers and cases, as can be seen in the expanded format.The minimal format also contains a graded form which is used by Gramad?n to generate comparativesand superlatives in the past and present.2.3 VerbsListing 5 shows an extract from a typical verb entry (bagair ?threaten?
)3 in minimal format, Listing 6shows a corresponding extract from the same entry in expanded format.
Verbs are more complicatedthan nouns and adjectives in the sense that they contain many more forms.
In the Irish National Mor -phology Database, a verb has forms for up to six tenses (past, past continuous, present, present con-tinuous, future, conditional) and two moods (imperative, subjunctive).
Note that we treat the condi-tional as a tense because it has the properties of a tense, even though grammar books traditionally cat -egorize it as a mood.The difference between a tense and a mood is that a tense can generate forms that are either declar -ative or interrogative, while a mood can only generate declarative forms (bagair!
?threaten!
?,  n?
ba-gair!
?don?t threaten!?).
Consequently, every tense form in the minimal format is labelled as beingeither dependent or independent, while mood forms have no such distinction.
The dependent and in-dependent forms are identical for many verbs, but different for some irregular ones (e.g.
d?an ?make?1 For a user-friendly presentation of the noun, see http://breis.focloir.ie/en/gram/abhainn2 For a user-friendly presentation of the adjective, see http://breis.focloir.ie/en/gram/b?n3 For a user-friendly presentation of the verb, see http://breis.focloir.ie/en/gram/bagair51in the past tense: independent rinne, dependent dearna).
The independent forms generate positive de-clarative forms (rinne m?
?I made?
), the dependent forms generate all others (n?
dhearna m?
?I didn?tmake?, an ndearna m??
?did I make?
?, nach ndearna m??
?didn?t I make??
)Additionally, every tense and mood form is assigned to a person, which in our analysis is a confla-tion of person, number and other features: there is a ?base?
person from which analytic forms are gen-erated (rinne ?made?
?
rinne muid ?we made?
), there are singular/plural first/second/third persons forsynthetic forms (rinneamar ?we made?
), and there is an ?autonomous?
person for passive forms of theverb (rinneadh ?was made?
).A typical verb has, in its minimal format, about 60 individual forms.
This is the set from whichGramad?n can generate a verb phrase in any tense or mood, person, number, polarity (positive or neg-ative) and shape (declarative or interrogative).
Unlike other parts of speech where the rules for gener-ating an expanded entry from a minimal one are completely regular, the verbal component in  Gra-mad?n has some hard-coded exceptions for a small number of irregular verbs.
Also, the verb b?
?be?
isquite exceptional as it is the only verb that has both a present tense ( t?
?is?)
and a continuous presenttense (b?onn ?habitually is?
); other verbs only have a continuous present tense (their non-continuouspresent tense is built analytically from the verbal noun).
Finally, the Irish National Morphology Data -base does not include the copula is, as we do not think it is as a verb.3 More about Gramad?nThe tool used for processing data in the Irish National Morphology Database,  Gramad?n, deservesseparate mention.
Besides converting entries from minimal to expanded format, Gramad?n has addi-tional features both below and above the level of words.Below the level of words, for nouns and adjectives that have not been included in the Irish NationalMorphology Database yet, Gramad?n is able to derive their forms and properties from knowing whichinflection class they belong to.
Unlike the traditional inflection classes found in Irish dictionaries,Gramad?n  uses a radically different  system,  inspired by Carnie (2008), where singular and pluralclasses are separate.Above the level of words, Gramad?n can be used as a realisation engine in an NLG (natural lan-guage generation) setting.
Gramad?n is able to use data from the Irish National Morphology Databaseto construct noun phrases, prepositional phrases and rudimentary clauses while respecting the rules ofgender and number agreement, initial mutations, case inflections and so on.
This aspect of Gramad?nis in development and the goal is, eventually, to cover all the basic syntactical phenomena of Irish in-cluding the construction of clauses containing the copula and the construction of  numbered  nounphrases (noun phrases with cardinal and ordinal numerals).While many of Gramad?n?s features are used for processing the Irish National Morphology Data-base, it is an independent software tool which has potential applications beyond it.4 Future plansThe Irish National Morphology Database is work in progress and will continue to be developed byForas na Gaeilge along with other outputs from the New English-Irish Dictionary project.
Once thedatabase structure has been finalized and detailed documentation has been produced, the whole dataset(along with its accompanying tool,  Gramad?n) will  be released under an open-source licence andmade available for download on the Internet.
In the longer term, we plan to develop the natural lan-guage generation aspect of  Gramad?n  and to use it as a basis for assistive language technology, aswell as to inform applied research into Irish morphosyntax.ReferencesAn Caighde?n Oifigi?il [the Official Standard].
