In particular we address thesemantic representation f syntactically unex-pressed arguments.We put forward a treatmentof this kind of optional complements in a frame-work that combines HPSG syntax and the se-mantic approach in GL (Pustejovsky, 1995).1 In t roduct ionIn this paper we address the representation fnouns having complex argument structures likedeverbal nominalisations (and other nouns withcomplements).
These classes of nominals veryoften appear in the surface string without theircomplements, even if they are semantically im-plied.
Such semantic implications are oftenshown in discourse, so that anaphoric referencescannot be accounted for without taking theminto account.
We put forward a treatment ofunexpressed complements o nouns in a frame-work that combines HPSG syntax and the se-mantic approach in GL (Pustejovsky, 1995).In the next section we present some data con-cerning the semantic implications of syntacti-cally unexpressed complements.
Our data arebasically from Catalan, but the discussion isclearly applicable to other languages includingEnglish.
In the third section we discuss the de-ficiencies of the standard treatments of option-ality of complements.
Finally, in section fourwe put forward our proposal.
We concentrateon the representation f deverbal nominalisa-tions, but we discuss some other kinds of op-tional complements o nouns.2 DataMost predicative nouns (i.e., those having com-plements) may or may not have their comple-merits present in the sentence.
1 In other wordsmost complements o nouns are optional (in anappropriate context): 2(1) a. Avui he vist el pare delToday have(l-s) seen the father of-theJoanJoanb.

Even withinthe context of verbal complements he discus-sions in the literature show that the distinctionsbetween classes of complements are far from ob-vious.
At the simplest level a twofold distinction1Here and throughout this paper we use the term"predicative noun" to refer to nouns that can have com-plements, thus including deverbal nd adjectival nomi-nalisatioas and relational nouns.2In the following a-examples the complements ofnouns that are omitted in the b-examples are writtenin bold face.
Note that the contexts usually have to bedifferent.may be proposed between (obligatory) comple-ments and (optional) adjuncts.
This howeverdoes not comply with the facts since it groupstogether very different classes of optionality:grammatically induced elision (4), optionalitywith semantic implications (5), as a pure ad-junct (6)... 3(4) a. Avui s' ha comentat la novel-laToday ReflPr has commented the novelb.

Avui he estat pintantToday have(I-s) been paintingThese very simple examples how that thepresence or absence of complements o predica-tive heads is not uniform from a semantic pointof view.
There are complements which are se-mantically external to the predication, whereasthere are others that are internal (that is to say,that contribute some entity to the relation de-noted by the predication).
And complementsmay or may not be present according to their se-mantic relation to the head.
Most external com-plements (i.e., adjuncts) are always optional:they may be present or absent irrespective oftheir particular elation.
4 But there are manyinternal complements hat can be optional andsome cannot be present except under very spe-cific circumstances; these are the complementsdescribed as default- and shadow-arguments re-spectively in Pustejovsky (1995:63f):3Some authors have proposed a graded classificationconsisting of 5 to 7 classes (Somers, 1987).4However there are a few cases where one might wantto say that there are obligatory adjuncts, as for examplein: this suit washes easily.
(7) a. D-Arg: John built the house out ofbricksb.
S-Arg: Mary buttered her toast with anexpensive butterWhen dealing with a purely syntactic gram-mar (or lexical representation) all these as-pects boil down to determine the degree of op-tionality of the complement and to deal withthe variation in syntactic behaviour accord-ingly.
That is to say in many implementationsof syntax some optionalities are dealt with bygeneral rules or principles (this is clearly thecase of the optionality of the logical subject,which is either accounted for by a passivisa-tion/impersonalisation rule of the grammar orby a lexical operation) and some are accountedfor by listing them as different entries (or justas subentries of the same entry).
But except forthe cases where a grammatical relation clearlyexists that applies to most lexical items of aparticular class (as passivisation to transitives),the optionality of complements is dealt with bylisting all the options in the dictionary.
Further-more such a treatment does not include someof the complements hat are allowed only un-der certain very specific circumstances (e.g.
D-Arg, S-Arg) since these can only be spelt outin semantic terms.Not surprisingly the application of these no-tions of obligatory and optional complements(developed for VPs and Ss) to NPs has not beensuccessful: too many arguments in the NP areoptional and there is too little grammatical con-trol (such as the one we find in passivisation)for general, syntactically based treatments tobe successful.
Note that even the simple dis-tinction between objective and subjective com-plements cannot be made operative on syntac-tic terms in Catalan and other languages (i.e.,without taking into account heir semantics):(8) a. l' estudi de les plantesthe study of the plantsb.
la soluci6 dels estudiantsthe solution of-the studentsc.
1' avaluaci6 dels inspectorsthe evaluation of-the inspectorsBut in addition there are strong reasons toconsider that a semantic approach has to betaken to predicate-complement representationif we consider discourse factors, such as coher-ence, anaphora and the recovering of implica-tions.
Consider the following examples:(9) a.

Of course thesubject of acabada (9a) and natural  (9b and 9c)is only recoverable as the result of the decorat-ing and translat ing act respectively; and the useof definite specifiers el seu and I in (9d) and (9e)is allowed by the "hidden" complement of mareand amanir .3 Standard  t reatment  in  a rguments t ructureThe standard treatment of syntactically ori-ented representations introduces ome level ofabstract description of argument structure insyntax, so that  general grammatical  relationscan be accounted for in a straightforward way.Thus, content relations can be stated betweenarguments and their heads that differ from thesurface syntactic ones.
In HPSG,  for example,control relations are expressed as coindexationbetween syntactic and argument values, in sucha way that a single valence element realises twoargument slots; and passive is (lexically) dealtwith as a change in the correlation between va-lence elements and argument ones.
5But  this level where argument structure isusually represented is a direct project ion (al-though neither simple, nor one-to-one) of thesurface structure.
That  is to say there are dif-ficulties in incorporating new argument slotswhen no correponding syntactic slot exists.
Andthis is so simply because the argument valuesare not thought as full semantic representationsbut simply as the deep representation f syntac-tic structure.
6Being syntactically oriented, the standardtreatments of argument structure can only rep-resent the types of complements that  corre-pond to the simple twofold dist inction men-tioned in the previous section: strongly re-stricted obligatory complements and optionaladjuncts.
~Nonetheless, there are at least threeaspects that are not considered in a satisfac-tory way: complements to verbs and to nounswhich are not linked with a strong syntact ic andsemantic relation, but cannot be treated as or-dinary adjuncts, i.e., intersectively (as for in-stance the kind of complements mentioned infootnote 4); complements to nouns generally,because they usually are optional (as in (1)to (3) above); and some complements to verbswhich are manifestly optional (as in (5)).
This isso because in the standard typing of arguments5Recall that the syntactic valence is expressed inHPSG as a list of descriptions ofthe complements whichinclude their semantics, and that the argument struc-ture is obtained by coindexing the semantic part of thatdescription with the appropriate argument slot.6In HPSG there is some ambiguity here, since theargument structure is embedded within the content partof the sign, where a lot of terminolgy is used that comesfrom situation semantics.7In HPSG for example the representation forthe for-met is strictly based on the coindexation between syntac-tic and argument values, whereas the treatment for thelatter assumes an event structure for predication and in-tersects itwith the optional adjunts (see Badia & Colom-inas (1996)).there is no way to introduce arguments (or otherkind of slots) that are not induced syntactically(or grammatically) in a restrictive way.
A fulltheory of lexical semantics is needed to do so ina consistent way.
For example, in Badia (1997)a particular case is considered and solved in anad hoc way: the nominal translation (as in 9babove) is said to have an extra argument (tothose inherited from the verb) so that its re-sult reading can have its denotation properlyderived.
This of course is only adequate for asmall class of the complements we have here inmind (see examples in (8) and (9) above) anddoes not derive from a general theory of argu-ment structure.Such optional complements have only beentreated in standard treatments by creating dis-tinct lexical entries, where the omitted com-plement is either just not present in the argu-ment structure representation r represented byan abstract existential quantification (without acorrespondence to any syntactically realised el-ement).
However this treatment neither eflectsthe relation between the different lexical entriesthat exist for a single word, nor is adequate inavoiding lexical redundancy.
An alternative op-tion that could be considered is to treat thosecomplements as adjuncts.
However the treat-ment of adjuncts has not been fully developedyet, so that most of the proposals at hand areonly adequate for intersective adjuncts.
8Furthermore, complements o nouns are par-ticularly difficult.
From a semantic (and argu-ment structure) point of view many of them arelike complements to verbs, in that they con-tribute entities to the relation denoted by thenoun; thus an adequate treatment might intro-duce a particular number of arguments for ev-ery relation class denoted by nouns (just as it isdone for verbs) (Badia & Colominas, 1996).
Butfrom the syntactic point of view the difficultyarises because they cannot be simply introducedin the valence lists (as verbal complements are).And a simple treatment as adjuncts is not verysatisfactory either since it would increase thecomplexity of the semantic alculations.8Non intersective adjuncts cannot be easily treated,particularly those that contribute a new entity involvedin the relation denoted by the predicate (for someof them quite complex proposals have been developedwithin HPSG: e.g., Kaspers, 1994).4 Proposed  t reatmentIn the following we attempt o account for someoptional complements of predicative nouns inHPSG, by enlarging the semantic informationand representing these complements in an in-formation level distinct from the valence lists.With regards to our semantic representationproposal, we maintain the referential informa-tion level in HPSG, expressed by means of theINDEX attribute.
However we follow Puste-jovsky (1995) in enriching the argument struc-ture information level (expressed in HPSG asthe RESTRICTION attribute and adapted here asARGUMENT-STRUCTURE (ARGSTR)), SO that D-and S-Args can be represented (in addition tothe strictly obligatory ones).
Furthermore wealso introduce the EVENT-STRUCTURE (EVSTR)and QUALIA levels of information estipulated inPustejovsky (1995).
The latter describes thelexical semantics of the entity and its related ar-guments, whereas the former displays the eventproperties of the expressed eventuality.
As willbe seen below, the argument structure level actsas interface between the mechanisms that allowfor the syntactic realisation of the complementsand the rich lexical semantics -constituted bythe EVSTR and QUALIA levels.
9Let us now consider the syntactic treatmentof D- and S-Args.
Due to their optionality, theHPSG standard treatment of obligatory com-plements by means of valence lists is not ade-quate for them.
Nonetheless a recent proposalby Sanfilippo (1998) gives a good insight intohow they can be treated.
For independent rea-sons he proposes that some complements aretreated as real adjuncts from a syntactic pointof view, even if they are thematically bound tothe relation denoted by the head.
We adoptthis mechanism and represent D- and S-Args asthematically bound adjuncts, introduced as setmembers at the nonlocal (NONLOC) informationlevel.
Thus the basic structure of the sign is asfollows: l?9In fact our implementation follows the lines devel-oped by Copestake (1992), Johnston (1996), among oth-ers.
Particularly we follow the formalisation of Puste-jovsky's semantics in feature structures developed inJohnston (1996).

It is anominalization from the verb construir ('build'),which subcategorises for two obligatory comple-ments: the agent and the result of the buildingprocess.As indicated in Pustejovsky (1995) this verbhas also a third argument expressing the ma-terial, a D-Are, which is syntactically optionalbut participates in the logical expression of theevent (see example (7a) above).
In the rep-resentation for that verb (figure 1), the firsttwo complements are expressed in the valencelists, whereas the latter is treated according toSanfilippo's proposal for thematically bound ad-juncts; that is, as a member at the nonlocal in-formation level.
In figure (2) we show the pro-cess nominalisation of construir where not onlythe D-Are but also ARG1 and ARG2 are not de-clared in the valence lists but included in thenonlocal set.
Recall that we treat them like D-Ares.For our implementation we use LKB (Copes-take, 1993).
We first derive the process readingof the nominal from the verbal exical entry: thenominal representation for the process reading(in figure 2) is obtained by (non-locally) inher-iting from the already existing lexical entry ofthe verb (in figure 1).
11 And secondly the lex-ical entry for the result sense of construcci6 iscreated by means of a lexical rule that replacesthe EVSTR head value and removes the ARG2attribute, the value of which is now declaredas the index value.
ARG2 has to be removedsince, as it expresses the entity resulting fromtribute in the rest of the structures in the paper.nThis is expressable in LKB by using the verballexical entry as a pseudo-sort (psort) (see Copestake(1993:23)).

Both kinds of ar-gument are logically implied by the semanticsof the predicate (verb or noun) but are syntac-tically optional.
They are distinguished fromPustejovsky's True-Arguments (T-Arg) - thatis, the syntactically realized parameters of thelexical items (Pustejovsky, 1995:63)- by meansof the syntactic level at which they are declared:in the valence list or in the set of nonlocal ele-ments.In order to show that other types of nominalscan also be treated in this way, consider for in-nRecall that creation ominals do not allow the resultnominalisation with the thematic argument: *la con-strucci6 de la casa ds molt sblida ('the building of thehouse is very robust').2ATSEM"HEADVALENCE"INDEXEVSTRARGSTRQUALIAnounSUBJCOMPS\ [ \ ]"EVENT1EVENT2RESTRHEAD"D-ARG1D-ARG2D-ARG3FORMAGENNONLOC \[ INHER \[ SLASH<o\[~\] process\ [ \ ]  state\[~ animate-ind\]\[\] artifact |\[~ material JRELN ~s 1 ARG1EVENTHEAD --{PP\[\], NP\[de\]\[\], PP\[\]}Figure 2: construccid (process reading)stance redescription nominalizations.
They dif-fer from standard creation predicates in thattheir process reading cannot express syntacti-cally the argument denoted by the result nomi-nalization.Consider the noun decoracig ('decoration'),derived from the verb decorar ('decorate').
Westart by assuming three arguments o that pred-icate: a first one corresponding to the agent, asecond one that expresses the theme (i.e., theobject being decorated), and finally a D-Argreferring to the material.
The agent and thetheme arguments are subcategorized as T-Argsby the verb, but realized as thematically boundadjuncts when appearing in a nominalization.As opposed to construir, the direct object ofdecorar does not denote the object resultingfrom the decoration act, but the object beingdecorated.
As a consequence both nominalisa-tion of decorar (process and result) allow theCATSEM"HEADVALENCE"INDEXEVSTRARGSTRQUALIANONLOC I INHER l SLASHnounI SUBJ COMPS55\]'EVENT1EVENT2RESTRHEAD"D-ARGID-ARG2D-ARG3(\[~\] process'\ [ \ ]  state\[K\]\[~ animate-ind\[\] phys-obj\[\] materialARG IFORM EVENT\[HEAD --"RELN decor-actARGI \[~\]ARG2 \[\] AGENARG3 \[\] artifEVENTHEAD +RELN part-O iCONST ARGi \[~\]\[ARG2 \[\]PPm, NP\[de\]\[\], PPEFigure 3: decoracid (process reading)complement that corresponds to the direct ob-ject of the verb (recall that this is not possiblein the case of result readings of creation predi-cates).
Therefore the presence of the objectivecomplement of decoraci6 is not useful for dis-ambiguating between the two readings.
Thusnominalizations like construcci6 and decoraci6with the objective complement differ in that thefirst one does not accept he two possible sensesappearing together, while the second one does.Following the treatment of Pustejovsky's dot-ted types in Buitelaar (1997), this fact leads usto conceive construccid as an open dotted type,and decoracid as a closed dotted type.The treatment we propose for decoracid is6CAT;EMHEAD nounSUBJVALENCECOMPSINDEX \[~3EVENT1EVENT2EVSTR !

Note that it is adequateto deal with facts such as the ones exemplifiedin (9a).
In this example the redescription omi-nal (decoraci6) expresses the process reading inthe first clause, and in the second one it is re-ferred to as denoting the object resulting fromthe process.
In the representation of the nomi-nal decoraci6 in figure (3) this is allowed by thethird argument of the AGENTIVE qualia, whichis not bound by any argument in the ARGSTR,just because it cannot be syntactically realisedin any case as an argument.
Note that argumentstructure acts as an interface between the richsemantic representation (i.e., the QUALIA andEVSTR structures) and the surface mechanismsthat allow for complements of the predicate (va-lence lists and non-local set).
Only semantic ar-guments that may be syntactically realised arepresent in the argument structure (either as T-Args or as D- or S-Args).
On the other hand the7rich semantic structure allows to express eman-tically implied arguments, and thus provides atreatment for semantically motivated iscoursefactors (such as the ones shown in (9) above).The proposal outlined here provides an ap-propriate treatment for the traducci6 example(9b).
Instead of the ad hoc solution adopted inBadia (1997) the treatment proposed here de-rives from a general and systematic approach tothe semantic structure of predicates and theirnominalisations.
To make things concrete wepresent in figure (4) the full lexical entry of theprocess reading of the nominal traduccid.
Thisrepresentation is able to deal with anaphoric ref-erence to the unexpressed result semantic argu-ment of the process reading (9b).
Note thata parallel verbal lexical entry also gives an ac-count of the anaphoric relation allowed by theverb traduir in (9c), and that a similar treat-ment is applicable to the verbs menjar andamanir of examples (5) and (9e).Of course this treatment applies in a generalway to other redescription predicates, like es-tudi ('study'), soluci6 ('solution') and avaluaci6('evaluation') in (8).
Notice as well that the richsemantic information we use allows us to dealin a natural way with the distinction betweensubjective and objective complements in thesedata.
In (Sa), for instance, estudi does not allowplantes ('plants') as the agent of the event sincetha agent has to be an animate individual: 13Other types of nouns with semantically im-plied (optional) complements can be similarlytreated; for example non deverbal nouns thatexpress a relation with another entity, likenouns denoting partition or sets (full 'sheet' in(2) and grup 'group' in (3)) or relational nouns(mare 'mother' in (9d)).
The arguments of fullor grup can be treated as D-Args because theyare not strictly obligatory but their semanticsis implied.
However the semantics of the syn-tactically realised complement need not corre-spond exactly to the semantic implication.
Forexample, the implication of .full realised with-out a complement is that it is a piece of paper;however the complement may denote any sim-*aNote that in the figure for estudi the HEAD values ofEVSTR and QUALIA levels are underspecified, similarly tothe value of the INDEX attribute, thus letting the entryunderspecified between the process and the result inter-pretation~ATSEMHEAD nounVALENCE \[SUBJL COMPS"INDEX index'EVENTiEVENT2EVSTR RESTR\[HEAD'D-ARGID-ARG2 ARGSTRQUALIAFORMALAGENTIVE<\ [ \ ]  process\[~\] stateel)ent\[\] animate-ind\]\[\] top jRELNARG iEVENTHEAD"RELNARG IARG2ARG3EVENTHEADstudy-act"\[\]\[\]\[\]\ [ \]:hNONLOClXNHERISLASH {PPm' NP\[de\]\[\])Figure 5: estudiilar class of material (card, cardboard, tissuepaper...) (Sauri, 1998).
We account for thisdifference by means of a lexical rule that over-writes the implied semantics of the complementwhen necessary.This treatment however is not adequate forrelational nouns, like mare ('mother') or pare('father').
These nouns do not allow the surfacerealisation of the semantic implication unless itis more specific:(10) a.

Ha vingut el pare de la JoanaHas come the father of the JoanaThis kind of complement can be seen asshadow arguments (S-Arg) of Pustejovsky's.
Inour proposal they are treated as D-Args becausethey are optional: their syntactic realisation iscontrolled via the non-local set and the semanticimplication is expressed in the FORMAL qualia.However a restriction has to be formulated uponthe semantics of the syntactic element withinthe non-local set: namely that it be more spe-cific than the semantic implication (see figure(6)).
