Metonymy as a Cross-lingual PhenomenonWim PetersNLP GroupDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of SheffieldRegent Court211 Portobello StreetSheffield S1 4DPU.K.w.peters@dcs.shef.ac.ukAbstractThe question of whether metonymy carries across languages has always been interesting for languagerepresentation and processing.
Until now attempts to answer this question have always been based onsmall-scale analyses.
With the advent of EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998), a multilingual thesaurus coveringeight languages and organized along the same lines as WordNet (http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/)we have a unique opportunity to research this question on a large scale.
In this paper we systematicallyexplore sets of concepts comprising possible metonymic relations that have been identified in WordNet.The sets of concepts are evaluated, and a contrastive analysis of their lexicalization patterns in English,Dutch and Spanish is performed.
Our investigation gives insight into the cross-linguistic nature ofmetonymic polysemy and defines a methodology for dynamic extensions of semantic resources.1.
IntroductionViewed traditionally, metonymy is a non-literal figure of speech in which the name ofone thing is substituted for that of anotherrelated to it.
It has been described as acognitive process in which one conceptualentity, the vehicle, provides mental access toanother conceptual entity (Radden 1999).
Inits basic form, it establishes a semanticrelation between two concepts that areassociated with word forms.
The semanticshift expressed by the relation may or maynot be accompanied by a shift in form.
Thesemantic relation that is captured bymetonymy is one of semantic contiguity, inthe sense that in many cases there aresystematic relations between metonymicallyrelated concepts that can be regarded as slotsin conceptual frames (cf.
Fillmore 1977).For example, in the sentence ?The coloniesrevolted against the crown.?
crown is used asa symbol for the monarchy as well asdenoting the traditional head ornament wornby the monarch.
As the example aboveshows, polysemy is a common way in whichmetonymically related concepts manifestthemselves in language.It is to be expected that any systematicsemantic relations between conceptsexpressed by these sense distinctions arelexicalized, i.e.
they are explicitly listed indictionaries and independent of a pragmaticsituation.
For example, university is on theone hand an institution and on the other abuilding.
The semantic relation between thetwo senses is ?is housed in?.Regular polysemy is a subset of metonymythat covers the systematicity of the semanticrelations involved.
It can be defined as asubset of metonymically related senses ofthe same word displaying a conventional asopposed to novel type of semantic contiguityrelation.
This relation holds for relatedsenses of two or more words (Apresjan,1973), i.e.
is a lexicalized pattern, not anonce formation (a pragmatically definednovel metonymy), and can therefore becalled regular.
It is this subtype ofmetonymy that we concentrate on in thispaper.2.
Regular polysemy across languagesThe question whether regular polysemy is across-linguistic phenomenon has until nowonly been approached by small scaleanalyses.For instance, Kamei and Wakao (Kamei,1992) approached the question from theperspective of machine translation andconducted a comparative survey of theacceptability of metonymic expressions inEnglish, Chinese and Japanese consisting of25 test sentences.
The results they reportshow that in some cases English andJapanese share metonymic patters to theexclusion of Chinese, but that in othersEnglish and Chinese team up.
(Seto1996) performed a study into thelexicalization of the container-contentschema in various languages (Japanese,Korean, Mongolian, Javanese, Turkish,Italian, Germanic and English).
This patternis lexicalized in English by ?kettle?:1.
A metal pot for stewing or boiling;usually with a lid2.
The quantity a kettle will holdHis observation was that the pattern isobservable in all languages, and can beconsidered cross-linguistic.
This small studyseems to indicate that the regular polysemicpattern extends over language familyboundaries to such an extent that it almostseems universal.
This could suggest that thepattern is rooted in general humanconceptualisation, and reflects an importantnon-arbitrary semantic relation betweenconcepts or objects in the world.
Indeed, ifwe describe the relation between containerand content in terms of Aristotle?s qualiastructure (Pustejovsky 1995), we see that itis the function of a container to hold anobject or substance (telic role) and that acontainer is normally brought into existencefor this purpose.More small-scale studies like the onesdescribed above have been performed,mostly relying on introspection and small-scale dictionary analysis.
A limited numberof patterns that are valid in more than onelanguage have been identified such ascontainer/content and producer/product(Peters 2000).
With the availability ofWordNet and EuroWordNet it has becomepossible to investigate the cross-linguisticnature of metonymy on a large scale.3.
EuroWordNetEuroWordNet (EWN) (Vossen 1997; Peters1998) is a multilingual thesaurusincorporating wordnets from eightlanguages: English, Italian, Dutch, German,Spanish, French, Czech, Estonian.
Thewordnets have been built in various ways.Some of them have been created on the basisof language specific resources and matchedonto the original Princeton WordNet(Fellbaum 1998) when the interlingualrelations were created.
They therefore reflectthe language specific lexicalization patternsand semantic organization.
Others have beenbuilt from the start on the basis of a matchbetween WordNet and bilingual dictionaries.In this case the conceptual structure is lesslanguage specific but can be regarded as theconceptual overlap between the structure ofthe English WordNet and the ontologicalstructure associated with that particularlanguage.EuroWordNet gives us for the first time theopportunity to examine the question of thelanguage independence of regular polysemyin a more systematic and automatic way.4.
MethodologyThe following methodology has beenfollowed:First, the hierarchy of WordNet1.6 wasanalysed in order to obtain Englishcandidates for regular polysemic patterns(section 4.1).
Then a process we call lexicaltriangulation was applied to these datawithin EuroWordNet (section 4.2).
Theresults were then manually evaluated.4.1 Automatic candidate selectionA technique was developed (Peters 2000)for identifying sense combinations inWordNet where the senses involvedpotentially display a regular polysemicrelation, i.e.
where the senses involved arecandidates for systematic relatedness.In order to obtain these candidate patternsWordNet (WN) has been automaticallyanalysed by exploiting its hierarchicalstructure.
Wherever there are two or morewords with senses in one part of the hierar-chy, which also have senses in another partof the hierarchy, then we have a candidatepattern of regular polysemy.
The patternsare candidates because there seems to be anobserved regularity for two or more words.This follows the definition of (Apresjan1973) mentioned in the introduction.An example can be found in Figure 1 below.fabric       covering   hypernym combination(something made by weaving or   (a natural object that covers or envelops)felting or knitting or crocheting natural orsynthetic fibers)fleece  words whose senses occur under both hypernymshairtapawoolFigure 1: words in WordNet covered by the pattern fabric/coveringWe have restricted our experiments to caseswhere the related meanings are of the samesyntactic class (nouns).
The procedure doesnot discover all regular polysemy rela tions,because the outcome is heavily dependenton the consistency of the encoding of theseregularities in WordNet.4.2 Lexical triangulationIn order to determine whether regularpolysemy is indeed a cross-linguisticphenomenon, one needs to comparelanguages, preferably from differentlanguage families.Data will depend heavily on vocabularycoverage in various languages, and until theadvent of EuroWordNet no serious lexicaldata sets were available for analysis.
TheEuroWordNet database is the mostcomprehensive multilingual thesaurus todate.
This resource not only provides us withan appropriate amount of lexical informationin terms of vocabulary coverage, but alsohas the additional advantages that itstaxonomic building blocks are identical forall languages involved and the languagespecific concepts are all linked to aninterlingua which is based on the full set ofthe original Princeton WordNet  (version1.5), and is referred to as the interlingualindex (ILI).We started with a comparative analysis ofGermanic and Romance languages.
Themain reason for this is that the size of thecorresponding wordnets is large enough toyield significant results.
For our analysis weused three languages: English, Dutch andSpanish, hence the term for this process:lexical triangulation.Singling out areas where three language-specific lexicalization patterns convergeenabled us to identify metonymic patternsthat supported the hypothesis that certainmetonymic relationships have a higherdegree of universality.We extracted the sense combinations ofSpanish and Dutch words that participate inany of the potential regular polysemicpatterns from the initial large set describedin section 4.1.
In other words, weconcentrate here on lexicalization patterns inthree different languages: sensecombinations that are lexicalized by onelanguage-specific word in English, Spanishand Dutch.The first step in this process was thereduction of the search space for regularpolysemic patterns in EuroWordNet.
Firstwe determined the conceptual overlap fornouns between the English, Dutch andSpanish wordnets.
Table 1 below shows thenumber of nouns in the three wordnetsinvolved.Table 1: conceptual coverage of English, Dutch and Spanish wordnetsThe conceptual overlap between thesewordnets is computed simply bydetermining the intersection of ILI nounconcepts covered by each of the wordnets.The total overlap is 17007 ILI concepts.There are 920 English polysemous nounswith two senses or more within synsetslinked to this set of ILI concepts.
Theirsenses have identical language specificlexicalizations in Spanish and Dutch.
Forexample, the English word church has onesense that is a building and another that is aninstitution.
The same sense distinctionsapply to the Spanish iglesia and the Dutchkerk .
The senses in the different wordnetsare linked through the ILI concepts bymeans of equivalence synonymy or near-synonymy relations (Vossen 1997).The second step was to map these nounsenses onto the results from the wordnetanalysis described in section 4.1, and then toevaluate the cross-linguistic validity of theregularpolysemic patterns that have been projectedfrom the English monolingual wordnet ontothe Dutch and Spanish wordnets.5.
EvaluationThe cross-linguistic filter yields a subset ofthe monolingual analysis data described insection 4.1.
It covers 404 distinct Englishnouns out of a total of 8062 (5%).This original filter considered nounssatisfying the criteria of Apresjan  (cf.section 1), i.e.
they are one of at least 2words with sense distinctions that exhibit aparticular relationship.The percentage covered by the cross-linguistic data compared to the originalanalysis gradually varies from a 100% forthe very small potential classes of regularpolysemy (2-3 words) to 1-2% for middlesized (30-50 words) and large classes (100+words).In order to create a set for manualevaluation, the set of 404 English nouns wasreduced by strengthening the Apresjancriterion and requiring that a word beconsidered only if it was one of at least athree word set illustrating the regularpolysemy (RP).
We will refer to this as athree-word RP class.
The rationale behindthis was that two word candidate RP classesintroduce noise because of the increasedlanguage Number ofnoun synsetsNumber ofcorresponding ILIconceptsEnglish 66025 66025Dutch 28352 26779Spanish 24073 24087probability of a fortuitous coincidence ofsenses belonging to a set of just two words.This step reduced the number ofparticipating words to 394.
At this point,177 words were randomly chosen from thisset for manual evaluation.
The evaluationconsisted of examining the hypernym pairsthat reflect a candidate regular polysemicrelation.1  The criteria used in this step aresemantic homogeneity (the semantic relationthat defines the candidate RP class shouldapply to the majority of the participatingwords) and specificity of the pattern (thelower the position of the hypernymic pair inthe hierarchy, the more specific the semanticrelation).109 of these words displayed valid regularpolysemic patterns (62%), 68 did not (38%).This means that by means of this automaticfiltering method we have a 62% success ratefor identifying valid regular polysemicpatterns.
Below are a few examples of cross-linguistic RP classes that have satisfied thecriteria of the evaluation.Hypernymic Pair: Control (the activity ofmanaging or exerting control oversomething) ?
Trait (a distinguishing featureof one's personal nature)English RP class (7 total): abstinence,sobriety, inhibition, restraint, self-control,self-denial, self-disciplineDutch RP class (2 total): zelfcontrole,onthoudingSpanish RP class (3 total): autodiscipline.abstinencia, abnegaci?n, inhibici?nCoverage of the intersection between allthree languages: 36% of set derived fromWordNetHypernymic Pair: Fabric (something madeby weaving or felting or knitting or1 A complication arises because manycombinations of hypernym pairs can beconsidered for the same set of words.
(In fact thepossibilities are the Cartesian product of theancestors of each of  the hypernyms in the pair).If all hypernymic combinations were taken intoaccount this amounts to an average of 17 classesper word.crocheting natural or synthetic fibers) -Covering (a natural object that covers orenvelops)English Rp class (4 total): wool, hair,fleece, tapaDutch RP class (1 total): wolSpanish RP class (1 total): lanaCoverage of the intersection between allthree languages: 25% of set derived fromWordNetHypernymic Pair: Plant (a living organismlacking the power of locomotion) - Ediblefruit (edible reproductive body of a seedplant especially one having sweet flesh)English RP class (159 total): apple,boxberry, blackcurrant, banana, fig  .

Universality of regular polysemyIt is possible to view these results as anindication of the cross-linguistic validity ofthe regular polysemic patterns and theirlevel of universality relative to the languagefamilies represented by the wordnets.
Thehypothesis is that if a metonymic patternoccurs in several languages, there is strongerevidence for a higher level of universality ofthe regular polysemic pattern.Of course there is interference with thecoverage of the wordnets in EuroWordNet.Since the Dutch and Spanish wordnets areonly half the size of the English wordnetonly limited coverage can be expected.
Still,the coverage seems to be consistently low inmost cases, often not more than 2-5%.
Onthe basis of wordnet size only one wouldexpect a higher coverage.There are other explanations for the lack ofidentical lexicalizations in other targetlanguage wordnets:1.
The metonymic pattern is languagespecific, and is not realised as apolysemous word in the target language.For example, the Dutch kantoor issynonymous to the English office in thesense ?where professional or clericalduties are performed?, but its sensedistinctions can not mirror the regularpolysemic relation in English with ?a jobin an organization or hierarchy?.2.
The pattern is unattested in the targetlanguage in terms of usage but forms apotential sense extension in thatlanguage.
For instance, the Spanishiglesia and the Dutch kerk  both mean?building for worship?
and ?a serviceconducted in a church?.
The Spanishwordnet has an additional systematicallyrelated sense for iglesia (?institution toexpress belief in a divine power?)
that isnot shared by its Dutch counterpart butis a valid new sense.3.
The missing sense can in fact only belexicalized by another word orcompound or derivation related to theword with the potentially missing sense.For example, the Dutch vereniging hasthe sense (an association of people withsimilar interests).
The Englishequivalent is club, for which there isanother sense in Wordnet (a buildingoccupied by a club).
This is not afelicitous sense extension for the Dutchvereniging, because the favouredlexicalization is the compoundverenigingshuis (club house).4.
The metonymic pattern is in fact attestedin the language, but one or more sensesparticipating in the patterns has not yetbeen captured in the wordnet.
One of thereasons could be the sense granularity ofthe resource on the basis of which thewordnet has been built.
For example ,embassy has one sense in WordNet (abuilding where ambassadors live orwork).
The Dutch translationalequivalent ambassade has an additionalsense denoting the people representingtheir country.
This sense can beprojected to the English WordNet as aregular polysemy pattern that is alsovalid in English.
In fact, LDOCE(Procter,1978) only lists the sense whichis missing in WordNet.7.
Coverage and extendibilityThere are many RP classes whose Englishword members do not all have a Dutch orSpanish counterpart.
We wanted to evaluatethe universality of the regular polysemicrelations by testing native speaker intuitionsabout these regular polysemic gaps.
Thiswas done by projecting the senses of theparticipating English words in an RP classonto Dutch and Spanish, and to assesswhether the missing senses were adequateadditional senses in these two languages.The experiment we conducted was verysmall.
We intend to perform moreexperiments of this kind in the future.
Thepattern we examined is the hypernymiccombinationoccupation (the principal activity in yourlife) ?
discipline  (a branch of knowledge).This RP class has five members.
Two Dutchand two Spanish native speakers were askedto judge the felicitousness of the senses thatare missing in the Dutch and Spanishwordnets.
Below is a short discussion ofeach member.interior design1.
the trade of planning the layout andfurnishings of an architectural interior2.
the branch of architecture dealing with theselection and organization of furnishings foran  architectural interiorThe corresponding Dutch wordbinnenhuisarchitectuur has only one sensewhich is linked to both WordNet senses bymeans of a near-synonymy relation.
Thismeans that the Dutch wordnet isunderspecified for the distinction of thesemetonymically related senses and can beextended with the specific sense distinctions(see explanation 4 above).
This coincidedwith the verdict of the Dutch jury.The Spanish WordNet has a separatetranslation for each sense: interiorismo(corresponding to interior design 1) anddeseno de interiores (corresponding tointerior design 2).
The latter translationalequivalent was considered to also have apossible trade reading.law1.
the learned profession that is mastered bygraduate study in a law school and that isresponsible for the judicial system4.
the branch of philosophy concerned withthe lawThe Dutch ?rechtswetenschap?
has onlyone sense, which is linked to both WordNetsenses by means of a near-synonymyrelation.
This again means that the Dutchwordnet is underspecified for the distinctionof these metonymically related senses andcan be extended with the specific sensedistinctions (see explanation 4 above).
Thiscoincided with the verdict of the Dutch jury.The Spanish equivalent of law 4 isjurisprudencia , whereas law 1 does not havea correspondence in the Spanish wordnet.The profession reading was not considered afelicitous additional sense for this word.Both subjects remarked that another wordcaptures both meaning: leyes, which is notpresent in the Spanish wordnet.literature:1. the profession or art of a writer2.
the humanistic study of a body ofliteratureThe Dutch letterkunde is only linked up tosense literature no.
2.
Sense no.
1 was notconsidered to be a straightforward new sensefor this word by the judges.The Spanish literatura lacks a professionreader in the Spanish wordnet.
This sensewas considered as valid by one subject, butrejected by the other subject.politics1.
the profession devoted to governing andto political affairs2.
the study of government of states andother political unitsThe Dutch word politicologie also has onlyone sense that is linked to both WordNetsenses by means of a near-synonymyrelation.
This again means that the Dutchwordnet is underspecified for the distinctionof these metonymically related senses andcan be extended with the specific sensedistinctions.
The Dutch subjects, however,were not happy with the profession reading.The Spanish pol?tica lacks a professionreading in the Spanish wordnet.
The Spanishsubjects considered this a valid sense for thisword.theology1.
the learned profession acquired byspecialized courses in religion (usuallytaught at a college or seminary2.
the rational and systematic study ofreligion and its influences and of the natureof religious truthThe Dutch theologie  has no professionreading.
This reading was considered validby the Dutch subjects.The Spanish teolog?a has both senses in theSpanish wordnet, and this coincides with thesubjects?
intuition.The results are summarized in table 2below.
Overall, the projection of the wordsenses onto the Dutch wordnet yields asense extension for one word out of apossible two.
For the Spanish wordnet thesame process creates valid new senses fortwo out of four words.Table 2: experimental results summary8.
ConclusionWe have described a methodology forsystematically and automaticallyinvestigating the question of whether or notcertain kinds of metonymic relationshipshold across languages.
We usedEuroWordNet as the test bed for thisinvestigation, although the technique is notlimited to EuroWordNet and will apply toany multilingual resource that captureshypernymic relationships and has somenotion of correspondences amonglanguages.
Our manual evaluation showsregular polysemy patterns to be valid acrossthe three languages examined, and indicatesthat regular polysemy has a certain level ofuniversality.
Also, the results of theexperiment indicate a potential forenhancing the semantic compatibility andconsistency of wordnets.
Wordnets areautomatically extendable on the basis ofregular polysemic information availablefrom other wordnets.
In our smallexperiment 50% of the Dutch and Spanishwords that do not display a WordNet-derived regular polysemic pattern weresuccessfully semantically enriched with thispattern.
Future work will involve furtherexperimentation.AcknowledgementThis work was supported by the UKEngineering and Physical Sciences ResearchCouncil under grant M73521 (MALT).Sensesavailable inNLSensepossible inNLSensesavailable inESSensepossible inESinteriordesignlumped intoone sense+ - +law lumped intoone sense+ - -literature - - - +/-politics lumped intoone sense- - +theology - + + +ReferencesApresjan, J.
