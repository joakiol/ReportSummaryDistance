We describe the features ofthe book and the method by which wedeciphered it.1.
Features of the TextFigure 1 shows a portion of an enciphered bookfrom the East Berlin Academy.
The book hasthe following features:?
It is 105 pages long, containing about75,000 handwritten characters.?
The handwriting is extremely neat.?
Some characters are Roman letters (suchas a and b), while others are abstractsymbols (such as 1 and <).
Romanletters appear in both uppercase andlowercase forms.?
Lines of text are both left- and right-justified.?
There are only a few author corrections.?
There is no word spacing.There are no illustrations or chapter breaks, butthe text has formatting:?
Paragraphs are indented.?
Some lines are centered.?
*This material was presented as part of an invitedtalk at the 4th Workshop on Building and UsingComparable Corpora (BUCC 2011).?
Some sections of text contain a double-quote mark (?)
before each line.?
Some lines end with full stop (.)
or colon(:).
The colon (:) is also a frequentword-internal cipher letter.?
Paragraphs and section titles alwaysbegin with Roman letters (in capitalizedform).The only non-enciphered inscriptions in thebook are ?Philipp 1866?
and ?Copiales 3?, thelatter of which we used to name the cipher.The book also contains previewfragments (?catchwords?)
at the bottom of left-hand pages.
Each catchword is a copy of thefirst few letters from the following (right-hand)page.
For example, in Figure 1, the shortsequence 3A^ floats at the bottom of the left page,and the next page begins 3A^om!...
In earlyprinting, catchwords were used to help printersvalidate the folding and stacking of pages.2.
TranscriptionTo get a machine-readable version of the text,we devised the transcription scheme in Figure 2.According to this scheme, the line>Ojv-</E3CA=/^Ub2Gr@Jis typed as:pi oh j v hd tri arr eh three c. ahni arr lam uh b lip uu r o.. zs2Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora, pages 2?9,49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,Portland, Oregon, 24 June 2011. c?2011 Association for Computational LinguisticsFigure 1.
Two pages from the Copiale cipher.The transcription uses easy-to-reach keyboardcharacters, so a transcriber can work withouttaking his/her eyes off the original document.There are approximately 90 cipherletters, including 26 unaccented Roman letters,a-z.
The letters c, h, m, n, p, r, s, and x havedotted forms (e.g., C), while the letter i also hasan un-dotted form.
The letters m, n, r, and uhave underlined variants (e.g., B), and thevowels have circumflexed variants (e.g., A).
Theplain letter y does not appear unaccented untilpage 30, but it appears quite frequently with anumlaut (y).The four Roman letters d, g, n, and zappear in both plain (d, g, n, z) and fancy forms(L, K, Y, J).
Capitalized Roman letters are usedto start paragraphs.
We transcribe these with A-Z, though we down-case them before countingfrequencies (Section 3).
Down-casing D, G, N,and Z is not trivial, due to the presence of bothplain and fancy lowercase forms.The non-Roman characters are aneclectic mix of symbols, including some Greekletters.
Eight symbols are rendered larger thanothers in the text: 9, @, #, %, 2, *, ?, and ?.We transcribed a total of 16 pages(10,840 letters).
We carried out our analysis onthose pages, after stripping catchwords anddown-casing all Roman letters.3.

Columnsalternate between the cipher letters and theirtranscriptions.The full digraph counts revealinteresting patterns among groups of letters.
Forexample, letters with circumflexes (A, E, I, O, U)have behaviors in common: all five tend to bepreceded by z and >, and all five tend to befollowed by 3 and j.
To get a better handle onletter similarities, we automatically clustered thecipher letters based on their contexts.
The resultis shown in Figure 4.
We did the clustering asfollows.
For each distinct letter x, we created aFigure 3.

For thesame letter x, we created another vector thatcaptures the distribution of letters than follow x,e.g., [0, 0, 7, 2, ?].
Then we concatenated thetwo vectors to create v(x) = [12, 0, 4, 1, ?, 0, 0,7, 2, ?].
We deemed two letters a and b to besimilar if the cosine distance between v(a) andv(b) is small, indicating that they appear insimilar contexts.
We used the Scipy software(http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~eads/cluster.html) toperform and plot a clustering that incrementallymerges similar letters (and groups of letters) in abottom-up fashion.The cluster diagram confirms thatcircumflexed letters (A, E, I, O, U) behavesimilarly.
It also shows that the unaccentedRoman letters form a natural grouping, as dounderlined letters.
Merges that happen low inthe cluster map indicate very high similarity, e.g.,the group (y, !, Y).4.
First Decipherment ApproachBuilding on the self-similarity of Roman letters,our first theory was that the Roman letters carryall the information in the cipher, and that allother symbols are NULLs (meaningless tokensadded after encipherment to confusecryptanalysis).
If we remove all other symbols,the remaining Roman letters indeed follow atypical natural language distribution, with themost popular letter occurring 12% of the time,and the least popular letters occurring rarely.The revealed sequence of Roman lettersis itself nonsensical, so we posited a simplesubstitution cipher.
We carried out automaticcomputer attacks against the revealed Roman-letter sequence, first assuming German source,then English, then Latin, then forty othercandidate European and non-Europeanlanguages.
The attack method is given in[Knight et al 2006].
That method automaticallycombines plaintext-language identification withdecipherment.
Unfortunately, this failed, as no5language identified itself as a more likelyplaintext candidate than the others.We then gave up our theory regardingNULLs and posited a homophonic cipher, witheach plaintext letter being encipherable by anyof several distinct cipher letters.
While a well-executed homophonic cipher will employ a flatletter frequency distribution, to confoundanalysis, we guessed that the Copiale cipher isnot optimized in this regard.We confirmed that our computer attackdoes in fact work on a synthetic homophoniccipher, i.e., it correctly identifies the plaintextlanguage, and yields a reasonable, if imperfect,decipherment.
We then loosed the same attackon the Copiale cipher.
Unfortunately, allresulting decipherments were nonsense, thoughthere was a very slight numerical preference forGerman as a candidate plaintext language.5.
Second Decipherment ApproachWe next decided to focus on German as the mostlikely plaintext language, for three reasons:?
the book is located in Germany?
the computer homophonic attack gave a veryslight preference to German?
the book ends with the inscription ?Philipp1866?, using the German double-p spelling.Pursuing the homophonic theory, our thoughtwas that all five circumflexed letters (A, E, I, O,U), behaving similarly, might represent the sameGerman letter.
But which German letter?
Sincethe circumflexed letters are preceded by z and >,the circumflexed letters would correspond to theGerman letter that often follows whatever z and >stand for.
But what do they, in turn, stand for?From German text, we built a digraphfrequency table, whose the most strikingcharacteristic is that C is almost always followedby H.  The German CH pair is similar to theEnglish QU pair, but C is fairly frequent inGerman.
A similar digraph table for the cipherletters shows that ?
is almost always followed by-.
So we posited our first two substitutions: ?=Cand -=H.
We then looked for what typicallyprecedes and follows CH in German, and whattypically precedes and follows ?- in the cipher.For example, ?-^ is the most frequent ciphertrigraph, while CHT is a common Germantrigraph.
We thus hypothesized the furthersubstitution ^=T, and this led to a cascade ofothers.
We retracted any hypothesis thatresulted in poor German digraphs and trigraphs,and in this way, we could make steady progress(Figure 5).The cluster map in Figure 4 was of greathelp.
For example, once we established asubstitution like y=I, we could immediately addY=I and !=I, because the three cipher lettersbehave so similarly.
In this way, we mapped allcircumflexed letters (A, E, I, O, U) to plaintext E.These leaps were frequently correct, and wesoon had substitutions for over 50 cipher letters.Despite progress, some very frequentGerman trigraphs like SCH were still drasticallyunder-represented in our decipherment.
Also,many cipher letters (including all unaccentedRoman letters) still lacked substitution values.A fragment of the decipherment thus far lookedlike this (where ???
stands for an as-yet-unmapped cipher letter):?GEHEIMER?UNTERLIST?VOR?DIE?GESELLE?ERDER?TITUL?CEREMONIE?DER?AUFNAHMEOn the last line, we recognized the two wordsCEREMONIE and DER separated by a cipherletter.
It became clear that the unaccentedRoman letters serve as spaces in the cipher.Note that this is the opposite of our firstdecipherment approach (Section 4).
The non-Roman letters are not NULLs -- they carryvirtually all the information.
This also explainswhy paragraphs start with capitalized Romanletters, which look nice, but are meaningless.We next put our hypothesizeddecipherment into an automatic German-to-English translator (www.freetranslation.com),where we observed that many plaintext wordswere still untranslatable.
For example,ABSCHNITL was not recognized as atranslatable German word.
The final cipherletter for this word is colon (:), which we hadmapped previously to L.  By replacing the finalL in ABSCHNITL with various letters of thealphabet (A-Z), we hit on the recognized word6Figure 5.
Progress of decipherment.
The main grid shows plaintext (German) letters across the top andciphertext letters down the left side.
The ciphertext letters are grouped into clusters.
To the right of themain grid are frequent German trigraphs (der, und, ein, ?)
and frequent cipher trigraphs (?-^, C:G, HC|,?
), with the two columns being separated by hypothesized trigraph decipherments.ABSCHNITT (translated as ?section?).
We thenrealized that the function of colon (:) is to doublethe previous consonant (whether it be T, L, F, orsome other letter).
Old German writing uses astroke with the same function.The cipher letter T was still unknown,appearing in partially deciphered words likeTAFLNER, TNUPFTUCHS, and GESELLTAFLT.We tried substituting each of the letters A-Z forT, but this did not yield valid German.
However,we found GESELLSCHAFLT in a Germandictionary, so we concluded that T stands forSCH.
This opened the door for other multi-plaintext-letter substitutions.Finally, we brought full native-Germanexpertise to bear, by taking hypothesizeddecipherments (hyp) and correcting them (corr):ey/t+Nc-ZKGQOF~PC|nMYC5]-3Cy/OnQZMEX?g6Ghyp:  is  mache ebenfals wilhuhrlise  bewegungecorr:  ich mache ebenfals wilk?hrliche bewegungen7a></b+!^Kz)jvHgzZ3gs-NB>vhyp:  dos  mit der andern handcorr:  doch mit der andern handrzjY^:Ig|eGyDIjJBY+:^b^&QNc5p+!^f>GKzH=+Gchyp:  dritlens einer n mlt tobach mit de  daumecorr:  drittens einer ?

Three cipher lettersremained ambiguous:?
[ could represent either SS or S?
5 could represent either H or K?
G could represent either EN or EMHowever, these three symbols are ambiguousonly with respect to deciphering into modernGerman, not into old German, which useddifferent spelling conventions.The only remaining undecipheredsymbols were the large ones: 9, @, #, %, 2, *,?, and ?.
These appear to be logograms,standing for the names of (doubly secret) peopleand organizations, as we see in this section: ?the9 asks him whether he desires to be 2?.6.
ContentsThe book describes the initiation of ?DERCANDIDAT?
into a secret society, somefunctions of which are encoded with logograms.Appendix A contains our decipherment of thebeginning of the manuscript.7.
ConclusionWe described the Copiale cipher and itsdecipherment.
It remains to transcribe the restof the manuscript and to do a careful translation.The document may contain further encodedinformation, and given the amount of work itrepresents, we believe there may be otherdocuments using the same or similar schemes.Plaintext (German) CiphertextA P N H 0*?
