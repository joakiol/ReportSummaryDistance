2.Hungary  I\[ - 6722Abst rac tThe purpose  of this cont r ibut ion  is tofo rmulate  ways in wh ich  the homonymy of so-ca l led  'Modal  Par t i c les '  and the i r  e tymonscan be handled.
Our aim is to show that noton ly  a s t ra tegy  for  this type of homonymycan be worked  out, but a lso a fo rmal i za t ionof in fo rmat ion  beyond propos i t iona l  contentcan be in t roduced  w i th  a v iew to its MT ap-p l i ca t ion .1.
In t roduct ionDur ing  the a lmost  40 years  of its ex is t -ence mach ine  t rans la t ion  has undergone  a con-s iderab le  re f inement  in the f ie lds  of bothsyntact i c  pars ing  and semant ic  representa -tion.
The deve lopment  of MT can be seen as atendency  to incorporate  more  and more l in-gu is t i c  knowledge  into \[:he fo rmal i za t ion  oft rans la t iona l  p rocesses .
Formal i za t ion  hasthus become a keyword  for MT and has had sev-era l  ma jor  imp l i ca t ions .
F i rs t ly ,  it re fersto the hypothes is  that  everyth ing  re la ted  toa g iven  language is s t r u c t u r e d inone way or another.
Secondly ,  fo rmal i za t ionis an o b j e c t i v e m e a n s of tes-t ing the va l id i ty  of the l ingu is t ' s  hypoth -eses about  l ingu is t i c  phenomena.
Th i rd ly ,  itinvo lves  the l ingu is t ' s  h o p e that  any-th ing that has to do w i th  language can infact  be fo rmal i zed .At present ,  there are severa l  semant ictheor ies  wh ich  cou ld  be labe l led  " formal  se-mant ics" .
They are preoccup ied  w i th  exp lo -r ing  the propos i t iona l  content  of d i f fe renttext -un i t s  and they do not deal  w i th  thephenomenon of "sub jec t iv i ty" .
Sub jec t iv i ty ,or se l f -express ion ,  as \]Lyons /1981, 240/ haspo in ted  out, "cannot  be reduced  to the ex-p ress ion  of p ropos i t iona l  knowledge  and be-l iefs".
If we th ink of MT in its ideal  form,i.e.
not as an abst rac t ing  device,  but as asys tem produc ing  automat ic  t rans la t ion ,  thenthe inadequacy  of res t r i c t ion  to propos i -t iona l  content  wi \ ] l  be ev ident?The present  paper  sets out to show thatthe express ion  of lex ica l  sub jec t iv i ty ,  con-veyed by moda l  par t i c les ,  should,  and can,be accounted  for in the process  of MT.2.

A rndt  1960/.These words  represent ,  in Arndt ' s  term,a granunatical no -man 's - land ,  a l though in thepast  ten years  there has been a cons iderab lein teres t  towards  moda l  par t i c les .59Words l ike the Engl ish ~ or the Ger-man nur present two problems from the pointof v iew of machine translat ion.
On the onehand, they are ambiguous and their homonymy1~/st be resolved.
On the other hand, whensuch lexemes are used as modal part ic les,their "translat ion" causes serious problemssince we can rarely translate the modalinto German as nut, or, say, into Hungar ianas csak.3.
Resolut ion of Homon?myAs far as homonymy is concerned, clear-ly the task is to set up formal rules forthe categor izat ion of a given word as op-posed to its a l ternat ive morpholog ica l  andsyntact ic status.The impl icat ion of the ass ignat ion ofsuch homonymous lexemes to certain classesof words is by no means a matter  of "simple"select ion restr ict ion at surface level.
Eachmodal part ic le  has preserved much of itsetymon's syntact ic and semantic propert ies.Given this, it fol lows that the ambiguitymay be resolved by construct ing small "sub-grammars" for each of these part icles, so asnot only to set them apart from their homo-nyms, but also to take into cons iderat ionthe whole co~nunicat ive content of the sen-tence.Thus, a subgrammar recogniz ing on l \ [  -either as a logical operator, with its re-str ict ive meaning, or as a modal particle,with its vague and, in a sense, antonymousmeaning -- would have to be capable of manipu-lating informat ion from di f ferent levels.
Bycompar ing sentences /la/ and /ib/ it couldbe concluded that, say, ~ is an operatorwhen it precedes an NP /e.g.
Det + Adj + N/and is a part ic le when fol lowed by too.
Butthis assumption can readi ly be proved faultyby cons ider ing /6/:/6/ I f  ~ you had come, you could  havesaved me a lot of trouble.It is commonly held that, in order toparse sentences, one needs strategies forlocat ing verbs and their complements,  assign-6Oing words to var ious categories,  dependingon context /Lehrberger 1982, 102/.
The rec-ogni t ion of part ic les can be done main ly  bystart ing from semantic representat ions  whichshould contain informat ion concerning boththe propos i t iona l  content of sentences andtheir extrapropos i t ional ,  or subject ive mo-dal content.
Thus, ass igning ~ to par-t icles would imply an a lgor i thm roughly de-f ined as: "If the lexeme ~ is used with aword that has no restr ict ive component  inits meaning, then it is a part ic le;  other-wise it is an operator".Pars ing along these l ines would mean avery compl icated presentat ion of d i f ferentparts of speech, inc luding not only NPs,made up of adject ives,  nouns, but also ad-verbs, pronouns and even phrases to accountfor ~n~ construct ions  l ike /6/.
In addition,a very sophist icated and precise def in i t ionof the res t r i c t ion /non- res t r i c t ion  opposi-t ion would have to be set up.Obviously, the d i f f i cu l ty  of ass igninghomonymous lexemes to modal  part ic les,  onthe one hand, and to operators,  intensi f iers,adverbs,conjunct ions,  and the like, on theother, l ies in the fact that the former beara re lat ionship  to the overal l  meaning of thesentence, whi le the latter add their meaningto the global meaning only via some lowerlevel of semantic structure.From the above cons iderat ion it fol lowsthat it would be a fair ly tedious and prob-ably unreasonable  task to attempt to resolvethis kind of  homonymy by the a lgor i thmiza-tion of abstract  sense-components.Instead, it might  be suff ic ient  to con-struct a subgran~ar to check ~ and otherhomonyms solely by reason of their  being aparticle.
One way to make the informat ioncontained in the subgrammar avai lable to theparser may be to indicate, in the d ic t ionaryentry of the homonym, all the cases in whichthe given word could poss ib ly  appear as apart ic le.In English, or French, the reso lut ionof ambiguity would mean sett ing up as few as6-10 subgrammars, whi le in German, Russianor Hungar ian there are scores of homonymouspart ic les and, consequently,  subgrammars.
Inaddition, the latter languages make quitef requent use of part ic le  combinat ions whichdo not, as a rule, der ive their  meaningsf rom a complement of the two /or more/ par-ticles, but have some di f ferent  meaning, cf./7/ Csak hem fdztdl meg?/8/ Yx ~e npocmyCunc~ nu m~?Nevertheless,  there seems to be no reasonwhy these combinat ions could not be inc ludedin the subgrammar under one or the other  dic-t ionary entry.4.
Trans lat ion of Modal  Part ic lesWhi lst  intensi f iers,  conjunct ions,  oper-ators, pronouns, or adverbs have meaningswhich may be cons idered more or less "univer-sal", the semantics of part ic les takes usinto a f ie ld speci f ic  to a part icu lar  lan-guage.
In other words, using ~ as an oper-ator is "almost" ident ical  to using, say,nur~ or seulment, or csah etc.
as an Oper-ator in German, French or Hungar ian respect-ively.
But when it comes to part icles, wemay exper ience d i f f icu l t ies  in preserv ingthe operator  equiva lent  of onl~ in the trans-lation of sentences like /ib/ into any otherlanguage.One poss ib le solution, as with lots ofd i f ferent  types of translat ion,  would  simplybe to consider  these words i r re levant fromthe point  of v iew of propos i t ional  contentmatching.
However, it would seem more plaus-ible to try to f ind equivalents  to these par-t icles in the target language since, depend-ing on the type of context to be translated,the express ion of subject iv i ty  may play amajor  role in produc ing the actual co~nuni-cative message.Funct ional  equiva lence is a not ion fre-quent ly  used in l inguist ic  theory /Arnol 'd1976; Sanders 1980/, and it can be appl iedas a yardst ick  in part ic le  match ing /Fig.
i/.A study of modal  part ic le  t rans lat ion is nowbeing undertaken in Szeged Univers i ty 's  Eng-l i sh-Hungar ian MT project  and it is basedon funct ional  equivalence.Those researchers who study MT in re-str icted semantic domains might over lookthe problem of the subject iv i ty  of the dif-ferent texts.
It should be noted, however,that "most of the unexpected structures onefinds in a sublanguage text can be associ-ated not so much with a shift in semanticdomain as with a shift  /usual ly quite tem-porary/ in the att i tude which the text pro-ducer takes towards his domain of discourse"/Kittredge 1982, 135/.
But even with aca-demic papers it happens to be the case thatdur ing their  t rans lat ion one should be awareof the appearance of some subject ive over-tone lest some mist rans lat ion  should ensue.In this respect, consider the fo l lowing twoexamples with on/\]/ as a particle:/9/ Onl?
too often have far-reaching con-clusions been drawn from inadequatedata col lected from a limited numberof languages.
/U l lmann:Semant ic  Uni-versals,  1966, p. 218//\].0/ Similarly, it is ~nl~_ natural thatverbs for "snoring" should in manylanguages contain an /r/... /Op.
