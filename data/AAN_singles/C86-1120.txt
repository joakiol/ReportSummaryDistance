Japanese Honorifics and Situation SemanticsR.SugimuraInst itute for New Generation Computer Technology (ICOT) Japan.ABSTILACTA model of Japanese honorific expressions ill situation semantics isproposed.
Situation semantics provides considerable power for analyzingthe complicated structure of Japanese honorific expressions.
The mainfeature of this model is a set of basic rules for context switching inhonorific sentences.
Mizutani~ theory of Japanese honorifics is presentedand incorporated in the model which has been used to develope anexperimental systom capable of analyzing honorific context.
Stonefeatures of this system are described.1.
Introduct ionTile Japanese language, like Korean and many nonoEm'opeanlanguages, contains a grmmnaticalized system of Ironer)tic forms.
It is wellknown that the use of honor)ties is closely connected to context, inehatingaspects like relatiw, social standing.
No effective mechanisms have heendeveloped to deal with this problem.
Situation Semantics (SS) IBarwise1982,1984a,1984b,1985a, 1985b,1985c,1985d,1985ell Barwise & Perry1983\] \[l,experaneeJ\[Pollard 1985HCreary & Pollard\] is a ttmory of contextused here to construct a nmdel of honorific sentences to analyze therelationship tmtween sentence and context.About Japanese, we call make use of Mizutani's theory of honor)lies\[Mizutani 1983a,1983b\].
This theory dees tackle tire relation betweencontext and sentence, but it seems that SS can describe context moveusefldly than Mizutani's theory.
In this palter, SS is used to reconstruct thecontext given by Mizutani's theory.
Ilonorifie forms arc analyzed and basicrules flu' context switching are established.Table 1 gives the relation between Mizutani's theory of honorifles andthe model.
This model can be divided into two parts.
The first part describesbasic context features and the second describes lexical rules based onMizutani's Jal)anese grammar, along with some basic mechanisms of"context switching.

= - =I~ is very easy to reln'esent some context features in discourse in SS, butcontext involves ome very difficult problems like "focusing."
We want toanalyze this in future research.
In this paper only enough elements forcontext required in Mizutani's theory are set up.The main concern here is the second part of the model which deals withthe relationship between contextual elements and lexical elements, attdespecially the mechanism of"context switching" on honor)tics.Mizutani's theory of honorific exltression i Japanese is described first.Then the model in ~{S is presented.
The context feature of relative socialstatus in Mizutani'n theory is realized in the first part of the model.
This isfollowd by explanal:ion ef some basic features designed to handle themechanism of context switching in the second part.
Finally, auexperimental system based on this model is given.
Tiffs system wasimplemented in CfL (Complex Indeterminate Imnguage)\[Mukai 1985a,1985b1.
Results from some experiments processing Japanese honorificexpressions are given at the end of the paper.2.
Mizutani's theory of Japanese honorific expression2.1.
Honorific Statustlonorific relations are represented as vectors in an abstracttwod imens iona l  henorifie space.
In the honorific space the speaker in timdiscourse is set as tile origin.
Other individuals like hearer and agents wireare presented in the sentence of discourse are represented by vectors as inthe following example.An honorific attitude is defined as tile vector between these points.
Forexample, the honorific attitude from tim speaker (1) to the hearer (Y) isdefined as a vector fi'om I{0,0) to Y(yl ,y2).
The honorific attitude fi'mn theEx .

)to,0)Illonorifie Spacehearer Y to agent2 is defined as the vector fi'om (yl,y2) to (a21, a22), i.e.,the vector (a2l-yl, a22-y2).Next, we define the honorific wlluc and the dh'ection in the followingway,Definition 1 Honorific valueFor t = <at ,a2>,honor i f ievalueof<t> - a2i f fa l  = 0;0 i ffal \= 0;Definition2 Honorific directionl) Up <1> > 0, 3) Flat <t> = 0Aal  = 0,2)\])own <t> <0,  4)Across <t> =0Aa l \=0,We represent the "flat" honor,fie relation between agents explicitly,but the "across" relation is represented as in which there is no need toexpress the honor,fie relation explicitly.
For conventional use, we definethe following direetlons.5) anyl up or down or flat.
6) any2 up or down or flat or acrossTe analyze ttte sentence uttered, definitions of tile following honorificrelations are necessary,Definition.3 First order honorific relationThe honer,fie attitude of the speaker to tim hearer.IYDefinition4 Second order honorific relationThe honorific attitude of tl,e ,;peaker or tile hearer toward the agent inthe sentence of discourse.
In this case the original point of tile vector shouldbe tile point of the hearer or sl)eaker, whichever is higher.

Before looking at this honorificrelation, we will show the small oumber of Japanese grammar rules used fodefine the structure of sample Japanese seutenees.

(like "Mr.")tu his theory, Mizutani attaches Japanese terms to each terminal andnon terminal node.

Model  of the honor i f ic  sentenceIn this section, we present our model in SS.
Readers who are famil iarwith SS can skip Section 3.1.3.1.
F i rs t  Par t  on Context  Features3.1.1.
Model  of d i scourseIn the theory of situation senmntics, discourses are represented withinsituations and constraints.
In formal representation the sentence andcontext are expressed in the form "d,c \[sentence\[s, e".
d stands for discoursesituation (l)U), c is the speaker's connection (CS), s is abe sett ing and e isthe described situation.
There is another situation called a resourcesituation in this theory.
In our model we define a resource situation for eachindividual.
(I) Dhcourse Situation (I)U)l Iere is an example of the representation f a sentence in discourse.Ex 2.
John said "Tom met Jane" to J im.el  : = loc, 10 ; yes saying John ; yesaddressing John, J im ; yes utter ing "Tom met Jane" ; yesl0 < ld (ld means discourse location)Discourse situations are represented in the following form as series ofterms expressing relations between speaker A, hearer B and utteredsentence \]\[alpha\]\].
in SS, spatio4emporal location is defined in discoursesituations, but we have no effective way to formalize it in our model, sospatio-temporal location is not represented.DU : = speaking A;yes addressing,A,B;yes saying,A,alpha;yes(11) Speaker's Connection (CS)The speaker's connection is a series of the following types.
A is theactual object and \[AI is the word that represents A.CS : = speaking A;yes refers A \[A\] ; yes(111) Resource Situation(RS)A resource situation is defined for each individual in a discourse; itcontains many events and constraints.RS : = agent A;yeshas ; {SOAs,Constraints Necessary,Nomic,ConventionalEvent type,,,,}3.1.2.
Honor i f ic  context  in the sentence(I) Honorific Attitude Event typeWe introduce an "honorific att i tude event type (Eh)" which stands foran honorific att itude in Mizutani's theory.Formula 1) represents the mind status (HE) of the speaker towards Eh.A denotes the individual and "Itr" indicates that in the nfind of theindividual A, the honorific event type Eh is "represented."
Eh shows theexternal honorific event including social honorifics.Formulas 2) through 5) represent he basic honorific att i tude eventtypes (Eh).
In Mizutani's theory, this event ype is represented as a vector,but we represent i in the form of a binary relation.
For one example, in 2)"honor-up" denotes the honorific relation between individuals t and t'.
"indt __ ; yes" denotes that t is an individual which can be represented in"  "asits name.Frame of Mind1 ) i lE := Itr, A, Eh ;yes o f t , _ ;yes  oft',.r_;yes2) Eh : = honor up t,t';yes ind t , _ ;yes  ind t ,__ ;yes3) Eh : = honor down t,t';tyes ind t, __ ;yes ind t',__ ;yes4) Eh honor~across t,t ;yes ind t, __ ;yes ind t '  ;yes5) Eh : = honor eq t,t';yes ind t, _ ;yes ind t' _ ;yes(11) Conditional Constraint on Word SelectionIn Section 2.3. we described the relation between honorific context andgrammatical  rules.
This section corresponds to Section 2.3.In Japanese there are many honorific words, and some interest ingphenomena are to be found in daily life.For example, a secretary in the company president's office should havemany honorific words in his resource situation (RS) because he always hasto be careful to use the appropriate honorific expression in his wm'k.
On theother hand university students will have a poor stock of honorific words forthere is no need to express honorific status, except o teachers.A constraint is required which determines the relation between thehonorific event type (Eh) and word representation.
This is the "conditionalconstraint on word selection (Cw)."
Mizutani's rules for f irst order throughthird order honorific relations given in 2.3. correspond to this constraintCw.
Word representation should be an event type called "honorific wordselection event (HW)", and if a person does not have this event type in hisresource situation, he or she will have a poor range of honorifics.
Werepresent these Cw and HW in formula 6).In formula 6), "Cwl(Eh,~q" denotes the conditional constraint of wordselection Cw which has Eh and anchor "f" as its conditional schema.
Anchor"f" determines the relation between indeterminates in Eh and objects l iketaro and hanako.
See Barwise's work for details.
6) is read : i fEb  is factualand Cw is satisfied, then ItW is actual.6) Cwl(Eh,f} := Involve Eh, l lW ;yesConditional constraint on word selection has an honorific event typeand its anchor as its scheme.
In Japanese honorific expressions, if Eh and fare given, the word representation will follow very easily.
Some instancesof thls are given in formulas 7) through 15).
For example, formula 7) can beread : if Eh is actual and the anchor f anchors t to individual J (J is thespeaker or the hearer) or t' to A1 in the agent case, then hw is actual so thatwhen refering to t' honorific form tairen-go (np) is added to the descriptionAI.7) Eh(0f ( t )=J , f ( t ' )=A1 bw:=re fer t ' , \ [A l \ ] \ [np inh- fo rm\ ]8) Eh{f) f it)= J, f(t') = A2 hw refer t', \[A2\]\[np in h-form\]9) Eh(f) f(t) = J, fit') = AI hw : = refer R, \[Rl\[vp in h-form\]10) Eh(f) f(t) = Al,f(t') = A2 hw : = refer R, \[R\]\[vp in h-form\]11) Eh(f) fit) = I, fit'} = Y law refer E ,  \[E Hps in h-form\]12) Eh(f) fit) = 1, f(t') = A 1 bw : = refer t', \[t\]13) Eh(f) f(t) =l ,  f(t') = A2 law:= refer t', \[t\]3.2.
Second Par t  on The Re lat ion  between Context  Features  and theSentence3.2.1.
C1L as bas ic  languageBefore going into the representation of lexical rules which give thecorrespondence between honorific word expressious and sentences, andcontext switching on honorific sentences, we describe CIL used in thedescription of lexical rules.
Accurate accounts of C1L can be found in\[Mukai 1985a,1985b\].
l lere only the part needed to understand the lexicalrules in section 3.2.2 is describe(\[.CIL (Complex Indeterminate Language) can be represented by thefollowing formula.C IL  =Pro log  + Parameter l zedTypes  +Freeze=Pro log  + Frame +Freeze .C1L has the unique data structure called "complex indeterminate.
"This data structure can be regarded as a frame and represented as in thefollowing example.
(1) te rm((Xwi tha := X,b:= YwhereX = Y)).
(2) > term(Z),a!Z = abc,b!Z = abc.yes.Formula (1) is the specification of the data type and this can be used informula (2).
"a := X" means assign value X to slot a.
"X=Y"  denotes thecondition part.
If this condition is not satisfied the unification "term(X)" in(2) will fail.
Formula (2) uti l izes the complex indeterminate and unifies"abc" to each slot value.3.2.2.
DCG Rules for honor l f ies(I) First order bonorifics As Rule 1 in Section 2.3. shows, first orderhonorifics affect "ps."
This is i l lustrated by the following examples.Ex.3 This corresponds toEh in 11) in section 3.1.2.ps(\[talX\],X,Context) <-dsolve(hono!((agent!(ds!Context))!(rs!Context),eq(speaker\](ds!Context),object!
(lex!Context))).,,< 2, denotes the operator ":-" in Prolog \[Bowen 1982\].
"\[ta\]X\],X" is theDCG parsing mechanism.
"Context" is a complex indeterminate variablefor the context for this parsing part.
"dsolve" is a Prolog predicate with thefollowing mechanism.dsolve(X,Y).
X is a l ist l ike \[a,b,c,dl which contains Prolog atmns or terms.Y is a Prolog atom or term.1) Search l ist X for Y.2) If there is a term in X with the same argumentsbut different erm name, fail and return.3) if  Y is not in X, then add Y to list X,succeed and return.4) l fY  is in X, succeed and return."hono!((agent!(ds!Context))!
(rs!Cantext))" r presents a list of honorificevent types in the resom'ce situation of the agent of discourse.
"object!
(lex!Context))" represents the lexical object in this parsing stage.
This508notation for lexical items has its origin in Lexical Functional GramrnartKaplan & Bresnaul, so this expression can be represented like (~object) inthe LFG manner.This example states that if"ps" = |taL then there should he honorificinformation i  the resource situation of the individual who is the speaker.If the speaker's RS contains two or nmre different erms expressing thehonorific relationship between the same agents, fail.
Thus, themechanism of2) in dsolve is very important because it shows that in thehonorific information of one individual there should not be differentinformation about the binary honorific relation between two individuals.
(11) Second order honorifics Lexieal rules for second order lmnorifiescan be represented asin following example program.Ex.4 This corresponds to Eh in 7) and 8) in Section 3.1.2.np(X0,X2,Context) <-n(X0,XI ,Context),sub3(X 1,X2,Context),dsolve(honn!((agent!(ds!Context))!(rs!Context),up(agenl,!(ds!X),obj!(lex!X))).
(Ill) Third order honorifics Lexical rules for third order honorifics can berepresenl;ed as in the following example program.Ex.5 This corresponds to Eh in 10) in section 3.1.2.vp(X0,X2,Context) <-v(X0,Xl ,Context),suM(X, ,X2,Context),dsolve(hono!((agent!(ds!Context))!(rs!Context),up(agenti(lex!X),obj!
(lex!X))).3.2.3 Context switching in honorific sentencesWhen we utilize the contextual elements like I)S and RS in discourseit is very difficult to decide the context for each sentence.
A sentence indiscourse can be represented by the expression "I)S,CS,I\[alptm\]\]S,E", butthen how do we nmp contexts like DS and CS to complex sentences ?Mizutani's theory of honorific forms does not go into context switching ina complex sentence.
So we have expanded his grammar and propose a basicmechanism for contcx~ switching.Consider sentence l) below uttered by individual S to R which means"individual T said that individual U said that Taro met llanako."
In thisexample, we establish relations a) through j) among S, T, U, Taro andltanako.
The operater > denotes the situation in which tim left hand sidehonm's the right hand side, < denotes the situation in which the right hadside hmmrs the left hand side, and = denotes the situation in which there isno need to use honerifics between left hand side and right hand side.The main point in utterances of this fm'm is that honorifics in thesesentence change according to the form of speech, such as direct orindirect speech.
BuL in the Japanese discourse there are no markers like"'" and "'", so in order to process these sentences correctly, we need themechanism of"context switching."
Without his mechanism, all sentenceswonld be parsed with one context, but this cannot explain the reason whyhonorifics change in complex sentences.1) In S's utterance he said to R( "T said, U said, Taro met tlanako")"taro sama ga hanako sama ni ai nasa( ta' to U ga iware ta' to T ga iu ta.InRSofS a) S>Taro  b) S>i lanakoc)S>T d) S> Ue) taro > hanakoIn I{S ofT f) T < U g) !l' = Taro h) T < Ilanakoi) Taro < tlanakoIn RSofU j) U < Taro k) U < \[lanakol)Taro > ftanakoThese are the parsing rules used to analyze utterances.IA) sentence--> an(X), ds!X = Y, agent!Y = s, ohilY = r,at!Y = L,/* a,b,c,d,e */ honoi(s!
(rsiX)) = \[down(s,taro),down(s,hanako),down(s,t),down(s,u),down(taro,hanako)\],/* f,g,h,i */ honoi(ti(rs!X)) = \[up(t,u),eq(t,taro),up(t,hanalm),up(taro,hanako)\],/*j,k,I */ hono!(u!

(ds!Y) = agent\[Z,ds!X = ds!Z,obj!
(ds!Y) = obj!Z.LS) sn(X) --> sn0(Y),\[to\],sn0(Z),agent!
(ds!Y) = agent!Z,dsiX = ds!Z,obj!
(dsIY) = ob.i!Z.LI) and L2) are fornml rules to start the process, while L3),L4} and LS) arebasic rules for determining context switch in sentences of discourse.LI) specifies the initial stage for parsing.
In 1) above S tells R somethingso this context is set in the slot denoted by ds!X.L2) states that all of the features of sn0 are transfered to sa to meet arequirement of Mizu(ani's grammar.
This is done easily by unification.1,3) means that all of the featnres in sn0 are transfered to sn.
Thismechanism corresponds to indirect speech.L4) means that there should be context switch.
As the discourse situationfor sn0, set agent of discourse of sn0 to agent of Z who utters sn0 and setobject of diseom'se ofsn0 to object of Z who hears this utterance.L5) means that in a sentence with no marker, there cat) be contextswitch, so if a parsing failed because of the context ofhonorifics, use thisrule.Sentence 1) is analyzed using rule 1,5) and the mechanism of contextswitch is dcerived fi'om phase (I) to phase 010.
(I) Parsing really starts with the rule 3) estimating that there is nocontext switching.
But at point *1, a conflict between S's resource situationand honorific expression occurs.
In S's resource situation, the honorificrelation between S and Taro is down(S, taro), but \[taro,samal requests thehonorific relation up(S,taro), so context switch occurs at *2.
Rule 5)switches the agent of discourse fi'om S to U.
Context switch does not occurat this point again.
We use the notation I)S(S) to state that the agent ofdiscourse is S. The symbol --> means the context of left hand side ischanged to the context of the right hand side as the result of context switch.

Ch and Cw509Now, we have come to the main point of our model, but there remains aninteresting feature of Cw.
This constraint is not verified so with sometrepidation we touch on it briefly here.For example, when a worker "Suzuki" refers to his friend "Tanaka" withcontempt, he will intentionally use a polite word to refer to him such as"Tanaka sensei" (Mr.Tanaka).
When the hearer (Y)bears this politeexpression,he d cides on honorific event types but finds conflicts betweenthese types and the normal social event ypes in his resource situation.Ex.6expression \[Tanaka sensei\] where Eh : = at h honor up,Suzuki,Tanakaexpression \[Tanaka sensei\] where Eh : = at l: honor down,Suzuki,Tmml~ain RS of Yl IE := I ir Y,Eh;yesEh := at lu: honor eq,Tanaka,Suzuki--> hearer find conflict and the hearer wonders why \[!Then the hearer (Y) wonders why he broke the universal honorificevent.
Finally, he comes to the conclusion that Suzuki intends either topraise Tanaka or berate him.
We can go no further on this problem here.There are other aspects to Eh.
If the sentence is given first, Eh will becalculated for each word and there remains a possibility of conflict betweenhonorific event ypes Eh in a simple sentence.
In a complex sentence themechanism of context switch will be used, but in a simple sentence thismechanism is not effective.
When the hearer tries to deal with thisconflict, he or she will assume that the speaker has some illegal honorificconstraint Ch'.
We have implemented this mechanism in our model system.4.
System ConfigurationOur experimental system written in C1L runs on the DEC 2060 andutilizes Prolog as the basic programming environment, which enables us touse CIL.
C1L is now compiled and runs very fast on DEC 2060.
Next, wewant to run this I)CG parser on the Bottom Up Parser \[Matsumoto 1983\],\[Matsumoto,Kiyono,1984\].5.
Some Other Examples\[n tiffs section, we give some examples which have no relation tocontext switching.1) Sentence without honorific expression.A sentence without honorifics is parsed.
Those are resource situationsfro" this type of sentence.I ?- parse(\[taro,ga,hanako,ni,at,tal,\[J,Context).RS ......\ [ i1855 ::anchor: = 1857,re lat ion:  = rs,agent: =,r,has:=\[ 1626, 34221 3885\]\[__1624= anchor: = 1626,  relation: --honor, spec: = equiagentl: = s, agent2: =taro3420: :  anchor: = 3422,  relation: = bonor,spec: = equiagentl: = s,agent2: = hanako \] l2) Sentence with illegal honorific expressionThe following is an sentence with conflict between honorific wordexpressions.
|taro\] is a word witbour honorifics but \[o,ai,nasat\] are wordswith honorifics fi'om the speaker to Taro.
In a simple sentence, thereshould not he conflict between honorific relations.
If there is, then thehearer R gets information that the speaker S has some trouble withhonorific word expression.\[?- parse(l)S,RS,CS,\[taro,ga,hanako,ni,o,ai,nasat,ta\],\[\]).RS ......\[ 1870 :: anchor:= 1872,re lat ion:=rs ,agent :=r ,has:=\[__1641, 3437, 4555\[ 5330\]\[ 1639::anchor: = 1641,re lat ion:  = honor,spec: =equi,agentl: = s,agent2: =taro3435::anchor:  = 3437,re lat ion:  = honor,spec: = equi,agentl: = s,agent2: =hanako4553::anchor:  = 4555,re lat ion:  = honor,spec: = up,agentl : = s,agent2: =taro\],5688: :  anchor: = 5690,re lat ion:  = rs,agent: =r,has:=\[ 5812\[ 5620\]\[ 5810::anchor: = 5812,re lat ion:  = i l legal,argl: = bonor,arg2: = s\]3) Complex caseThis example sentence contains ninny honorific expressions.

ConclusionIt is easy to model honorific context in situation semantics.
But wedon't know how this context is represented in the human mind.
Thisrequires further esearch.This treatment of the context switching mechanisms of honorifics isa first step toward analyzing more complicated phenomena.
The maincontribution ~)f this model derives from the fact that in any complexsentence, there will probably be context switching on honorifics..But thismodel shows context switching in a complex sentence only and tttereremains more complicated phenomena like the following.S tlanako soma ni aLta' \[ttanako sama\] isa honorific fm'm(1 met Ilanake.
)R "llanako samattc dare?'
(Who is "Ilanako"?
)I--- $1 - IS 'Tanaka Ilanako' (tlanako Tanaka)R 'Aa, hona no yatsu ka' \[hana\] is nonhonorific form(Oh, liana!
)$1 is the direct speech act and ttmre should be a context switchbecause when R knows who llanako is, he refers to her with thenonhonorific "liana."
But we do not formalize the context switch whichdecides who is the agent of sentence $1.
To solve this problem, we shoulduse an "anaphora mechanism for the honorific context" and in order tobuild a firm model of this mechanism, study not only of the anaphoramechanism I Barwise 1985c1 but also the focusing mechanism \[Sidner\] isrequired.
These also are topic for filrtbcr research.ACI(NOWlA~\]DGEMEN'rS1 would like to thank Mr.Mukai of \[COT for his comments on contextswitching and Mr.Yokoi, the lleod of the Second Research Laboratory atICOT, for his encouragement and for allowing nm ample time for thiswork.I{EI~ERENCE\[Barwise 19821 Barwise, J., "Some Computational Aspects of SituationSemantics", ACt,(1982),pp.
