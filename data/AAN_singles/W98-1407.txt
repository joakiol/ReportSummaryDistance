frAbst ractA frequently encountered problem in urban life is navigation.
In order to get to some placewe use private means or public transportation, and if we lack clear directions we tend to askfor help.
We will deal in this paper with the descriptions of subway routes and their automaticgeneration.
In particular, we will try to show how the relative importance of a given piece ofinformation can effect not only the message but also the form.1 In t roduct ion :  the problemA frequently encountered ?problem in urban life is the use of ?public transportation: we have toget from here to there and quite so often we dori't know how.
As it is not always possible to gethelp from a person (be it because nobody is available, or able to speak our language), we mightappreciate assistance of a machine.In order to convey to the user "useful information", we must define what "usefulness" means.For example, if we ?tell someone how to get from one place to another, we hardly ever specify allthe intermediate steps, in particular if there is no ambiguity.
Also, not all information is of equalweight.
Yet, as we ?will show ' the notion of "relative importance" of information is gradual in nature?
rather than discrete , that is a simple binary Value (important vs. unimportant) 1.?
All this reflects, of course, in the content and form of the final text.
Relative importance is sig-naled by different means at the text level (headers, paragraphs, etc.)
and at the sentence l vel (wordchoice, ?syntactic structure: main clause versus subordinate clause, topic-comment ?structures).?
Concerning the prominence status (i.e.
relative importance of a piece of information), semi-oticians and text linguists have reached a similar conclusion by distinguishing between the 'Yore-ground/background" or "primary/secondary level" of a text \[Bar66, vD77, AP89, Com92\].
Ac-cording to Combettes \[Com92\], the "primary level" deals with the core meaning, i.e.
events andfacts that make the text progress, while th e "secondary level" deaIs ?with descriptions, evaluations,comments, and:reformulati0ns. "

: : :The distinction of levels, with information Of varying shades (salience gradation), implies thatit should be possible to identify corresponding linguistic "markers" for each one of them.
Yet,as Combettes has pointed out \[Com92\], the means used for marking the relative importance ofinformation may vary ?from one type of text to another.
Nevertheless, certain markers do ?holdlln this respect we cieviate from:most,.

!regardless of the text type.
This is particularly true for certain syntactic devices uch as subordinateclauses, appositions, nominalization, all of which are, according to Combettes, markers of thesecondary level, unlike main clauses which mark the primary level.Analyzing a corpus of route descriptions in French we have identified correlations between thesalience status of specific conceptua !
chunks (landmarks, segment distance, etc.)
and linguisticstructures (independent vs. subordinate clauses).
In section 2, we will reveal how the saliencestatus of some types of information may affect the content and form of the final text.
In section 3we will illustrate our use of these data in a generator of subway route descriptions.2 A case study: subway route descr ipt ionsRoute descriptions are interesting for at least two reasons: first of all, as navigation aids in generalthey help to solve a real world problem; second, despite their apparent simplicity, especially w i thregard to surface form, they require the solution of a number of non trivial linguistic and discourseproblems, problems which are intimately rooted in human cognition,Our analysis is based on a corpus containing 30 subway route descriptions in French.
The datawere collected from ten subjects via e-mail.
Each one of them had to describe three routes in theParisian subway.
These routes differ in terms of length and complexity.
The first route involves 9stops and one transfer.
It is the longest.
The second one contains 4 stops and no transfer.
It is thesimplest.
The third route, though very short (4 stops), is the most complex one as it involves twotransfers.2.1 Ana lys i s  of  the  under ly ing  contentThe information contained in subway route descriptions can be divided into two broad categories:"global" and "local" information.
We describe each one of them below, illustrating particularinformation types with examples taken from the corpus.Global informat ion:?
identification of the route by specifying departure and destination,eg.
Po~r aller de Saint-Lazare 5 Jussieu... / To go from Saint-Lazare to Jussieu...?
comments concerning the complexity of the whole route,eg.
C'est simple et rapide, pas de changement.
/ It's simple and fast, no transfer.?
information concerning the distance of the whole trip,eg.
~a doit faire 7 ou 8 stations en tout.
/ This should make 7 or 8 stops for the whole trip.Local informat ion:?
stop of departure, eg.
ii partir de Jussieu, tu prends... / Starting from Jussieu, you take..."?
destination, eg.
tu arrives h Gate de Lyon / you arrive at Gate de Lyono?
lines to take, eg.
prendre Ia ligne 5 / take the line number 5?
transfers, eg.
changer h Opdra / change at Opera?
directions to take, eg.
tu prends la direction Gallieni / you take the direction Gallieni?
partial distances to cover, eg.
il y a une seule station / there  is only one stop59 ~'According to Wunderlich and Reinelt \[WR82\], "local information" is the core of route descrip-tions, while "global information" is additional as it serves mainly interactional purposes.
?
In theremainder of our analysis we will concentrate on the "local route information" and the way it isexpressed in the domain of subway route descriptions, the objective being to determine whethersome information is obligatory or not.
Of course, we could have defined on a priori grounds what\ .
?
?
should be mentioned explicitly and what not.
Yet, we preferred to ground our work on empmcaldata.We assume that "obligatory information" is information that is contained in all descriptions ofthe corpus, whereas "optional information" occurs only occasionally 2.
We have also tried to findexplanations for the omission o f  optional information.
For example, the stations of departure anddestination could be considered as optional, since they are already known by the "questioner" (eitherbecause they are a part of the question, or because they are given with the context/situation ).Indeed, our  data reveal that, while the destination stop is always mentioned, the  departure ismentioned only in 50%of  the cases (eg.
/ i  Jussieu, tu  prends... / At Jussieu, you take...).
In thelight of these data we conclude that it is useful to make a distinction between given and new, orknown and unknown information.
The problem concerning the "known" information is to decidewhether to make it explicit or not .
This is not a conceptual problem, - the known information mustalready be present at the conceptual level, - the choice is pragmatic in nature (what informationshould be conveyed, because it is really useful?
), with possible stylistic side effects.
For example, thefact that the destination (known information) is mentioned systematically in the corpus seems to bebased on "stylistic" considerations: if it were not, the description would look like being incomplete.On the other hand.
: decisions concerning "new" information do involve conceptual choices.
Theyconsist in determining whether to include a given piece of information in the message or not, andin determining its degree of salience.The rest of our paper deals only with the analysis of "new" information, since we are mainlyinterested in the choices at the Conceptual level and their consequences on the linguistic form.
Asthe data show, information concerning transfer stations and directions of lines is obligatory!
bothtypes of information systematically occur in the corpus.
The corpus also reveals that informationconcerning partial distances (number of stops to travel on a given line) and the names of the lines(eg.
"line 7" or "orange line")is optional.It should'be noted, that partial distance may be represented in two ways in the domain of subwayroute descriptions: either as the length of a route segment (eg.
"two stops"), or as the result of thenumber of stops counted (eg.
"second stop"), This kind of information is not mentioned at all in30% of the cases.
We have noticed that the inclusion/exclusion f information concerning partialdistances depends on contextual factors such as the "value" of the distance itself (one stop vs.several) and the position on the route (last route segment or not).
A "one-stop distance" is moreimportant han a segment containing several stops.
Also, the distance of the last segment seemsto be more important han the distances of the intermediate segments (unless they are equal toone stop).
Other strategies concerning information on partial distances have been observed: somesubjects have mentioned all of them in each one of their description, regardless of the number ofstops and the relative position of the segment, while others did not mention them at all.
Anotherkind of optional information are the names of the lines to take.
This may vary from place to place,but at least in Paris it is the direction (final destination) of the train that tells the user whichtrain to take.
The names of the lines, represented by numbers, were omitted in one third of  thedescriptions in the corpus.In the next section we describe the results of our linguistic analysis.
We will show what spe-2Of course, this poses the problem of completeness and representativeness of the corpus.60IIIII!1,ILiIIcific linguistic resources (independent clauses vs. sufiordinate structures) are used for expressingobligatory or optional parts of information.2.2 Cor respondence  between ?
conceptua l  sa l iency  and  l ingu is t i c  resourcesIt  comes as no surprise that independent ?
clauses are the major syntactic structure used.
Theirfunction is to convey information of primary importance.
Our analysis of the corpus Shows thatindependent clauses are mostly used in order to convey "obligatory" information, namely informa-tion specifying the names of the stations where to get off  and directions to take.
This is the casein example 1 below 3, where only these two chunks of information are contained in the independentclauses.Ex.
1 ,~ Saint-Lazare, prendre la direction GaIlieni.
Descendre ~ Opdra (deux stations plus loin).
Ps'endrealors la direction Mairie d'lvry/Villejuif jusqu'~ Jussieu (7-~me station).At Saint-Lazare, take the direction Gallieni (two stops ahead).
Then take the direction Mairie d'lvry/Villejuif untilJussieu (Tth stop).However, independent clauses may also convey optional information.
Ill this case, we considerit as a way of signaling prominence.
For example, in our corpus there are cases where a "one-stopdistance" (distance being optional information) is expressed by an independent clause:Ex.
2 A Bastille, prendre le m~tro n 1 direction Chhteau de Vincennes et descendre &la prochaine stationqui est la Gate de Lyon.At Bastille, take the line number 1, direction Chateau de Vincennes, and get off at the next stop which is Garede Lyon,Tile names of the lines (optional information), together with information concerning tile di-rection (obligatory information), are also quite frequently mentioned in independent clauses (seeexample 3).
Again, we consider this as a sign for signaling high prominence:Ex.
3 A Saint-Lazare , prendre la ligne 3 direction Gallieni et changer h Opera.
Prendre ensuite la iigne 7direction Mairie d'Ivry et descendre h Jussieu.At Saint kazare, take the line 3 direction Gallieni and change at Opera.
Then, take the line 7 direction Mairied'lvry and get off at Jussieu.Subordinate structures are generally used to convey optional information or information of minorimportance.
This is in our case information concerning partial distances and names o f  lines.
Inexample 4 below, the information concerning partial distance is included only for the last segment,which is expressed by an "anaphoric lause".
Example 5illustrates a strategy whereby prominenceof the names of the lines is decreased: they are expressed in bracketed appositions.Ex .
4 A Saint-Lazare prendre le m~tro n 3 direction Gallieni, changer b.
OPera et prendre le m~tro n 7direction Mairie d'Ivry/Villejuif et descendre ~t Jussieu (c'est la 7-~me station).At Saint-Lazare take the number 3, direction Gallienl, change at Opera and take the number 7 direction Mairied'lvry/Villejuif anti get off at Jussieu (it's the 7th stop).Ex.
5 Prendre direction Gallieni (ligne 3).
Sortir b.
Opera (2 stations).
Prendre direction Mairie d'Ivry(ligne 7).
Descendre h Jussieu (7-~me station).Take direction Gallieni (line 3) and change at Opera (2 stops).
Take the direction Mairie d'lvry (line 7) and getoff at Jussieu (7th stop).aExamples from the corpus are followed by their English equivalents.?
?
61We distinguish between two cases of subordinate structures: subordinate clauses and apposi-tions.
The former include relative clauses (eg.
"descends ?
Opera qui est la 2-~me station" / "getoff at Opera, which is the second stop") and anaphoric clauses (eg.
"tu prends la direction Mairied'Ivry, c'est la ligne 7" / "you take direction Mairie d'Ivry, it's the line 7").
We divide apposi-tions into nominal and prepositional appositions: Nominal appositions occur after an independentclause and may be used with various punctuation devices uch as comma, colon, or brackets.
Inour corpus, they generally occur in brackets, for example; "descendre ~Gare de Lyon (stationsuivante)" / "get of at Gare de Lyon (the following stop)".
Prepositional appositions occur before.an independent clause.
They are used to mention "known" information like "get-on stations" (the"departure station" or a "get-on station" that has been mentioned before as a "get-off" or "transferstation"), for example: "Descendre ~Bastille.
De Bastille, prendre.
, . "
/ "Get  off at Bastille.
FromBastille take...".
: In order to be able to  automatically generate route descriptions in line with these linguisticdata, we have defined a set of rules that map the relative salience of a given piece of informationonto one or several syntactic structures (cf: section 3 below, table 1 and table 2).3 A subway route descript ion generator based on empirical dataAs we have shown, when people give directions the)' tend to use specific strategies for signalingthe relative importance of a given piece of information.
These strategies have been encoded in aprogram, written in GNU Emacs Lisp, that generates subway route descriptions.
The generator is,at its present state,operational for two subway networks: Paris and Montreal.
The examples usedto illustrate our approach deal with a route in the subway of Montreal.The generator is composed of two main modules: a referential module and a discourse module.The former computes the fastest route between two stations, while the latter generates the corre-sponding text.
The discourse module is divided into two Components.
Th e first one divides theroute given?
by the referential module into conceptual clusters, whereas the second one plan's thetextual structure of the description.The conceptual structuring consists in dividing a route into segments and landmarks \[Maa93\].Landmarks are defined in terms of attribute-value pa!rs of relevant "places" and "paths" which,inour  application, correspond respectively tO "stops" (stations) and to ?
"portions of subway linesin a given direction".
The output of the conceptualizer takes the form Of a list of attribute-valuepairs, representing landmarks for route segments and for stops.
Examples of such representationsand their corresponding texts are given in section 3.1.Information concerning partial distances i  represented ither as an attribute of path landmarks(dimension) or as an attribute of stop landmarks (order) ?
.
The relative importance of this infor-mation is represented by the attributes degree-dim and degree-order.
The names of the linesare represented by the path-landmark's ?attribute name, and their importance is specified by theattribute degree-name.The fun ctiort creating the conceptual representation (the message) takes as input two "prag-matic" parameters.
The first onespecifies the relative importance (with values ranging from 0 to3) of partial distances (represented by the attributes dimension and order), while the second onespecifies the relative importance (possible values: 0=-2) of the names of the lines (attribute name).The values of the attributes degree-dim and degree-order,  which express the "local importance"of partial distances, are computed on the basis of the value of the "global importance", as specifiedby the input parameters, and by looking at a given segment's distance (one stop vs. several) andchecking the segment of the route currently processed (the last one or not).
The obtained values of62!!
"local importance" (i.e.
values of the attributes degree-d im and degree-order )  allow for makinglater on certain choices at the text level.
Table 1 shows the rules for making these choices: the mostimportant information (value 3) is expressed by an independent clause, the next highest (value 2)is expressed by a relative or anaphoric lause, while the least important information (value 1) isexpressed by a bracketed apposition.\Global import .

This value (between 0 and 2) determines whether and how to expressthe information inthe final text.
The rules presented in table 2 are simpler than the ones given for partial distances(table 1).
This is so because the names of the lines are either included or not in a description,and this is valid for all the segments described.
The relative importance of this information showsup at the text level via its linguistic form: independent clauses ignaling higher prominence thanappositions.Global import .
Conditions of inclusion Local import.0 not included none1 included 12 included 2Textual real izationnoneapposition between brackets'independent clauseTable 2:' Correspondences between the saliency of names of the lines and linguistic forms.The text module relies on schemata which, for a given conceptual input, specify the possiblelinguistic forms on a local and global level 4 It should be noted though that, even if the global andlocal choices depend fairly much on one another and on the  conceptual input, there is still quitesome freedom for "stylistic" variation: the way the schemata re defined allow us to generate awhole class of texts for a given conceptual input.3.1 Examples  and  ana lys i s  o f  resu l t sIn this section, ?~ve illustrate through automatically generated examples how the relative importanceof partial distances and line names lead to quite different exts.The examples given below refer to the route from "Charlevoix" to "Acadie" in the subway .ofMontreal (see figure 1).
As the route contains two transfers (one at "Lionel-Groulx" and another one4The reason why we believe in the virtue of a "schema-driven approach" is based on the observation that peopleoperate on larger "chunks" rather than on atomic units such as words or concepts \[Zoc96\].53at "Snowdon"), we divide it into three segments, the distances of each segment being respectivelyone, four and five stops.Ligne : bleueDirection : Saint-MichelLigne : orangeDirection : C6te-VertuC6te-des-NeigesVilla-MariaVend6me?

of a given piece of information and its linguistic counterparts: according to its relative importance,an  attribute is either expressed by an independent clause (salience high) or by a subordinatestructure (salience low).
We have also noticed that different subordinate devices vary in terms oftheir status of importance.
For example, relative clauses eem to be used for signaling information.of higher prominence than bracketed appositions.We have applied the results of our analysis to a generator that can automatically produc esubway?
route descriptions in French.
By taking into account he relative importance of information, weare able to get a better :ontrol than otherwise over the use of linguistic resources observed in the66IIIIiil!corpus.
This enables us to generate route descriptions which are in line with the ones produced bypeople.While our work is not the only one dealing with route descriptions (see, for example, \[Kle82,WR82, May90, Maa93, GL95\]), it is original in that it is, according to our knowledge, the only: attempt to show how the notion of "relative importance" of route information maps onto linguisticform.
\The results obtained so far are encouraging.
Yet, they have to be evaluated i)y users, in orderfor us to see to what extent and with respect o what particular needs different versions of texts?
produced by our generator are helpful for navigating in the subway.
We will also investigate possible?
extensions of the generator to other types of routes.AcknowledgmentWe would like to thank the Programme Franco-Qugbdcois de coopdration scientifique t technique,th&ne: "Inggnierie linguistique de la connaissance'for their financial Support, and Wojtek Fraczakfor helping us during the implementation.References\[AP89\] J .
