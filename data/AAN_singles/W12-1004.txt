Exploring Framenet InformationDana Dann?llsSpr?kbankenDepartment of SwedishUniversity of Gothenburg, Swedendana.dannells@svenska.gu.seLars BorinSpr?kbankenDepartment of SwedishUniversity of Gothenburg, Swedenlars.borin@svenska.gu.seAbstractToday museums and other cultural her-itage institutions are increasingly stor-ing object descriptions using seman-tic web domain ontologies.
To makethis content accessible in a multilin-gual world, it will need to be conveyedin many languages, a language gen-eration task which is domain specificand language dependent.
This paperdescribes how semantic and syntacticinformation such as that provided in aframenet can contribute to solving thistask.
It is argued that the kind of in-formation offered by such lexical re-sources enhances the output quality ofa multilingual language generation ap-plication, in particular when generat-ing domain specific content.1 IntroductionToday museums and other cultural her-itage institutions are increasingly storing ob-ject descriptions using structured informa-tion representation formats, such as seman-tic web domain ontologies.
To make suchcultural heritage content accessible to differ-ent groups and individuals in a multilingualworld, this information will need to be con-veyed in textual or spoken form in many lan-guages, a language generation task which isdomain specific and language dependent.Generating multilingual natural languagetexts from domain specific semantic repre-sentations, such as semantic web domain on-tologies, is a task which involves lexicaliza-tion and syntactic realization of the discourserelations.
This paper deals with the syntac-tic realization problem, which is best illus-trated with an example.
Consider the pos-sible formulations of the semantic relationCreate_representation that has been lexicalizedwith the English verb paint:1.
Leonardo da Vinci painted this scene.2.
The lovely Sibyls were painted in the last cen-tury.3.
The Gerichtsstube was painted by Kuhn in1763.The syntactic structure of each sentencediffers in terms of the semantic roles of theverb arguments and other constituents of thesentence.
The first sentence contains the se-mantic roles Creator and Represented, the sec-ond sentence contains Represented and Time,and in the third sentence we find Creator, Rep-resented and Time.As the examples show there are severalways of semantically characterizing the sit-uation expressed by a verb, with implica-tions for the syntactic realization of that verb.When generating natural language from se-mantic web ontologies it is important to findgeneric strategies that allow us to identifythe semantic elements of a verb and associatethem with the appropriate argument realiza-tion of that verb.
This is particularly relevantin multilingual settings because the semanticand syntactic behavior of verbs will vary de-pending on the target language, both in theconstructions found and in their distribution.Previous work on natural language gener-ation of cultural heritage information fromsemantic web ontologies has relied on alarge amount of specially tailored manuallinguistic information to produce descrip-tions that are targeted to a specific group ofreaders (Androutsopoulos et al, 2001; Dan-18n?lls, 2008; Konstantopoulos et al, 2009).
Al-though valuable information for generatingnatural languages is found in computationallexical-semantic resources such as the Berke-ley FrameNet (section 3) which exist today inseveral languages (Erk et al, 2003; Subiratsand Petruck, 2003; Ohara et al, 2003; Borin etal., 2010), there has been little emphasis onhow to manage digitized data from digitallibraries using these open source resources.In this paper we demonstrate how the infor-mation available in such electronically avail-able resources can be exploited for generat-ing multilingual artwork descriptions.In the remainder of this paper we describea case study on English and Swedish that un-derscores the importance of using a lexicalresource such as a framenet (section 2).
Wepresent the kind of information that is offeredby two existing framenets (section 3).
Wedemonstrate how a domain specific naturallanguage generator can benefit from the in-formation that is available in both framenets(section 4).
We end with a discussion andpointers to future work (section 5).2 Data Collection and Text Analysis2.1 Corpus DataTo identify the semantic and syntactic con-structions that characterize object descrip-tions in the cultural heritage domain, wehave collected parallel texts from Wikipediain two languages: English and Swedish.
Intotal, we analyzed 40 parallel texts that areavailable under the category Painting.
Addi-tionally, we selected object descriptions fromdigital libraries that are available through on-line museum databases.
The majority of theSwedish descriptions were taken from theWorld Culture Museum,1 the majority of theEnglish descriptions were collected from theMet Museum.22.2 Semantic AnalysisThe strategy we employed to analyze thetexts follows the approach presented byMcKeown (1985) on how to formalize prin-1<http://collections.smvk.se/pls/vkm/rigby.welcome>2<http://www.metmuseum.org>ciples of discourse for use in a computationalprocess.
Seven frame elements have been ex-amined, these include: Location (L), Creator(CR), Representation (RE), Represented (R), De-scriptor (D), Time (TI), Type (T).
The text anal-ysis has shown that the following combina-tions of these major frame elements are themost common:1.
RE, T, CR, TI, L, D, R2.
RE, T, CR, R, TI, L, D3.
RE, TI, T, CR, D, L, R4.
RE, TI, CR, D, R, LThe listed semantic combinations reflectthe word order that we have found in thetext analysis for the two languages.
How-ever, since many of the analyzed sentencesthat begin with the object in focus (the Rep-resentation) appear in the passive voice, i.e,was painted by, was created by, the word or-der of these combinations may vary.
Further-more, not all of the listed semantic elementsare mandatory in the object descriptions.
Forexample, although corresponding to the firstcombination of semantic elements, the sen-tence De Hooch probably painted this picturein the early 1660s only contains the frame el-ements CR, RE and TI.2.3 Syntactic AnalysisThe texts have been syntactically annotatedusing the Maltparser (Nivre et al, 2007).

While in the English sen-tence the verb was painted is followed by apreposition phrase (PP), the Swedish verbm?lades (the passive form of ?paint?)
is fol-lowed by a cardinal number without a prepo-sition (which could be analyzed as an NP).3 Framenets3.1 The Berkeley FrameNetThe Berkeley FrameNet (BFN)3 (Fillmore etal., 2003) is an electronic lexical resourcebased on the notion of Frame Semantics (Fill-more, 1985); we know the meaning of a wordthrough prototypical situations (scenarios) inwhich the word (called a lexical unit, LU) oc-curs.
A frame can be described with the helpof two types of frame elements (FEs) that areclassified in terms of how central they are toa particular frame.
A core element is one thatinstantiates a conceptually necessary com-ponent of a frame while making the frameunique and different from other frames.
Onthe other hand, a peripheral element does notuniquely characterize a frame and can beinstantiated in any semantically appropriateframe.
For example, table 1 describes the lex-ical units and the frame elements appearingin the frame Create_representation, which hasthe following definition (from the BFN web-site):A Creator produces a physical objectwhich is to serve as a Representationof an actual or imagined entity orevent, the Represented.Each lexical unit appearing in the framecarries information about its related frame el-ements (semantic valency) and their syntac-tic realizations (syntactic valency).
Examplesof the valency patterns that are found for theverb paint are listed in table 2.4Examples of sentences that can be formedwith these semantic and syntactic represen-tations are:3http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/4The abbreviations in table 2 and table 4 follow theBFN annotation scheme: Dependent (Dep), ExternalArgument (Ext), Object (Obj), Constructional null in-stantiation (CNI).Create_representationLUs carve.v, cast.v, draw.v, paint.v,photograph.v, sketch.vFEsCore Creator (C), Represented (R)Peripheral Depictive (D),Depictive_of_represented (DR),Means (ME), Instrument (IN),Iteration (I), Material (MA),Manner (M), Place (P),Purpose (PU),Representation (RE),Role (RO), Time (T)Table 1: LUs and FEs in the frame Cre-ate_representation in BFN.Creator (CR) Represented (R) Time (TI)NP.Ext NP.Obj PP[at].DepPP[by].Dep NP.Ext PP[in].DepTable 2: FEs and their syntactic realizations foundin the Create representation frame for the verbpaint.1.
The Gerichtsstube was painted by Kuhn in1763.2.
The youngest girl had her portrait painted byhim .3.
He painted her at least fourteen times.3.2 The Swedish FrameNetBFN has formed the basis for the de-velopment of computationally orientedfreely available framenets for a number oflanguages (Boas, 2009), among these theSwedish FrameNet (SweFN) (Borin et al,2010).5SweFN takes its conceptual backbone fromBFN, i.e., the core and peripheral elementsare exactly the same for frames appearingin both framenets.
Each frame also containssemantically annotated example sentencesfrom which we can extract syntactic informa-tion.
The most notable differences betweenthe frames can be seen from a comparison oftable 1 and table 3.The lexical units in each SweFN frame arelinked to the Swedish lexical-semantic re-source SALDO (Borin et al, 2008).
SweFN isalso organized into a domain hierarchy, witha general domain and at present the two spe-5http://spraakbanken.gu.se/swefn/20Create_representationvb: avbilda..1, avportr?ttera..1,filma..1, fotografera..1,kn?ppa..5, pl?ta..1,portr?ttera..1, skissa..1,LUs skissera..1, skulptera..1;;vbm: m?la_av..1;;nn: framst?llning..1, teckning..1,pennteckning..1, skiss..1,sk?mtteckning..1,tuschteckning..1,frihandsteckning..1Domain Gen/ArtSem Type Symbolic_creationCompound Manner+LU,Representation+LUTable 3: LUs and FEs in the frame Cre-ate_representation in SweFN.cialized domains Art and Medicine.
In addi-tion, each frame in SweFN is associated witha semantic type and a list of compounds in-stantiating part of a frame configuration.Syntactic valency information is obtainedfrom the Swedish Simple and Parole lexicons(Lenci et al, 2000).
The encoding of this va-lency information is different from the oneprovided in BFN.
For example, for the verbavbilda ?depict?
we find the following syntac-tic valency:S_NP_A/x [vb] DO_NP_B/yS denotes the subject of the sentence, DOdenotes direct object.
Both are realized as ei-ther animate (A, B) or inanimate (x, y) NPs.In addition, it is possible to extract almostthe same information about semantic andsyntactic valency from the example sentencesfor the verb avbilda (table 4).
It is important tonote that the syntactic annotation in SweFNdoes not follow the BFN model, although weuse the same annotation scheme here to facil-itate comparison.Examples of sentences that can be formedusing the semantic and syntactic representa-tions listed in table 4 are:Creator (CR) Represented (R) Time (TI)NP.Ext NP.Obj AVP.DepCNI NP.ExtTable 4: FEs and their syntactic realizations foundin the Create representation frame for the verb av-bilda ?depict?.1.

?4 Multilingual Language Generationof Museum Object Descriptions4.1 The Language Generator ToolWe have developed a domain specific gram-mar application to generate multilingual art-work descriptions from domain specific on-tologies.
The application is developed in theGrammatical Framework (GF) (Ranta, 2004).The key feature of GF is the distinction be-tween an abstract syntax, which acts as asemantic interlingua, and concrete syntaxes,representing linearizations in various targetlanguages, natural or formal.
The grammarcomes with a resource library which aids thedevelopment of new grammars for specificdomains by providing syntactic operationsfor basic grammatical constructions (Ranta,2009).The information available in BFN andSweFN on semantic elements and their pos-sible syntactic realizations with specific lex-ical units has guided the (manual) develop-ment of the generation grammars.
Below wepresent the abstract and the concrete gram-mars of English and Swedish for the seman-tic elements RE, CR, TI and R.In the abstract grammar we have a list ofdiscourse patterns (DPs), encoded as func-tions that specify the semantic roles appear-ing in the pattern.DP1: representation creator timeDP2: creator represented timeIn the concrete grammars, patterns are lin-earized differently for each language.
Seman-tic elements listed in each DP are expressed21linguistically with the resource grammarconstructors.
In the examples below we findsix of the GF constructors: mkPhr (Phrase),mkS (Sentence), mkCl (Clause), mkNP (NounPhrase), mkVP (Verb Phrase), mkAdv (VerbPhrase modifying adverb).
The lexiconswhich we use to lexicalize the verbs and thesemantic elements are the OALD for Englishand SALDO for Swedish.DP1representation creator time =str : Phr = mkPhr(mkS pastTense(mkCl (mkNP representation)(mkVP (mkVP (passiveVP paint_V2)(mkAdv by8agent_Prep (mkNP creator))(mkAdv in_Prep (mkNP time))))));DP1representation creator time =str : Phr = mkPhr(mkS pastTense(mkCl (mkNP representation)(mkVP (mkVP (passiveVP maala_vb_1)(mkAdv by8agent_Prep (mkNP creator))(mkAdv noPrep (mkNP time))))));When used for generating sentences, theabove grammatical representations will yieldsyntactic trees with the structures exempli-fied in figure 1 above.4.2 Linguistic Realisations fromFramenetsThe advantage of the implementation strat-egy presented in section 4.1 is that we canbuild different syntactic trees for each lan-guage to form a description regardless of theorder of the semantic elements.Let us consider the lexical-semantic infor-mation provided in tables 2 and 4.
This infor-mation could be embedded in the applicationgrammar to compute the following linguisticspecifications.DP2creator represented time =str : Phr = mkPhr (mkS(mkCl (mkNP represented)(mkVP (mkVP (mkVP paint_V2))(mkAdv by8agent_Prep (mkNP creator))(mkAdv in_Prep (mkNP time)))));DP2creator represented time =str : Phr = mkPhr (mkS(mkCl (mkNP creator)(mkVP (mkVP avbilda_vb_1_1_V)(mkNP (mkCN represented(mkAdv noPrep (mkNP time)))))));These specifications can in turn be used togenerate sentences like the following:1.
[Captain Frans Banning Cocq]R painted [byRembrandt van Rijn]CR [in 1642]TI .2.
[Rembrandt van Rijn]CR har avbildat [KaptenFrans Banning Cocq]R [1642]TI .
?Rembrandt van Rijn has depicted CaptainFrans Banning Cocq 1642.?The discourse patterns can be automati-cally modified to compute a variety of lin-guistic specifications that are acquired fromlexical-semantic frames.5 SummaryThis paper has demonstrated the differencesin the syntactic realization of verbs in twolanguages.
We described what kind of se-mantic and syntactic valency can be obtainedfrom the information given in two framenetsto improve syntactic realizations of object de-scriptions from particular sets of semantic el-ements.The cultural heritage domain is a potentialapplication area of a framenet, which we ar-gue is an essential open source resource forgenerating multilingual object descriptions.We believe it is possible to establish more ef-ficient processing if the framenet is domain-specific and thereby offers linguistic struc-tures that are specific to the domain, in ourcase the art domain.
Even though our gen-eration grammars at the moment have beenmanually constructed using the framenet in-formation, we hope that we have shown theutility of being able to draw on a framenetin developing such applications.
The nextlogical step will be to attempt to generate(partial) grammars automatically from theframenet information directly.
We also intendto increase the grammars to handle a largerset of semantic frames.22ReferencesIon Androutsopoulos, Vassiliki Kokkinaki, Agge-liki Dimitromanolaki, Jo Calder, Jon Oberl, andElena Not.
