THE LIMITS OF UNIFICATIONRobert  J. P. Ingr iaBBN Systems and Technolog ies  Corporat ion10 Mou l ton  Street, Mai lstop 6/4CCambr idge,  MA 02138Intemet:  ingr ia@BBN.COMABSTRACTCurrent complex-feature based grammars use a sin-gle procedure--unification--for a multitude of pur-poses, among them, enforcing formal agreementbetween purely syntactic features.
This paperpresents evidence from several natural anguages thatunification--variable-matching combined with variablesubstitution--is the wrong mechanism for effectingagreement.
The view of grammar developed here isone in which unification is used for semantic interpre-tation, while purely formal agreement involves onlya check for non-distinctness---i.e, variable-matchingwithout variable substitution.1 In t roduct ionIn recent years, a great deal of attention has been de-voted to complex-feature based grammar formalisms--i.e.
grammar formalisms in which syntactic elementsare not atomic symbols, but rather complex elements,such as value-attribute or term structu~s; see Shieber(1986) for an overview.
Typically such formalisms usea single mechanism--variable substitution--for allpur-poses, and the most widely used variable substitutionmechanism is unification) Such complex-feature basedgrammars, then, axe viewed as systems in which partialfeature structures are built up, by the process of unifica-tion, into successively more specified structures.
Whileit is formally elegant o use a single mechanism for anumber of purposes, this theoretical elegance is real-ized in practice only if the mechanism does not requirethe other modules of the system to be complicated toachieve this "elegance".
Currently, unification is usedfor at least four puq3oses:1 In the rest of this paper, for convenience I will use the term"unification" instead of "variable substitution", since it is the mostcommonly used type of variable substitution, but it should be bornein mind that the point being made here holds for variable substitution,in general.?
to enforce formal agreement between purely syn-tactic features?
to "percolate" features between apre-terminal cat-egory and the phrase which it heads?
to pass features between a dislocated element--such as a WH-phrase--and its trace?
to build up semantic representationsThis paper will focus on the use of unification toenforce agreement and will present evidence from sev-eral natural anguages which argues against its use inthe case of purely formal syntactic features: when suchfeatures are lexically or morphologically underspecified,they remain so, even under agreement, contrary to thepredictions of a system using unification for agreement.Moreover, it is worthwhile stressing at the outset hatthe main argument of this paper is not that there arecertain constructions that present aproblem for unifica-lion, and, hence, require some technical solution.
Thepoint is much stronger:, even if some elaborate analy-sis can be devised that allows unification to be used toeffect agreement, this would be the wrong tack to take.Rather, the argument will go, using unification to effectagreement is incorrect both for theoretical reasons--itpresents a view of language which is contradicted bythe facts--and for practical reasons---using unificationto effect agreement can impede a system's robustnessand transportability.2 The  ParadoxA typical paradigm thin is presented to show the almosttransparent application of unification to agreement phe-nomena is the following:(I) a.
The sheep is ready.b.
The sheep are ready.c.
The sheep is there.d.
The sheep are there.e.
*The sheep that is ready are there.194Sentences (la) through (ld) are taken to indicatethat "sheep" is underspecified with regard to number;, itcan be either singular or plural.
(le), on the other hand,shows that "sheep" cannot be both singular and pluralat the same time.
In the relative clause, "is" is markedas singular, and "sheep", interpreted as its subject viathe relative connector "that", must also be singular.
Onthe other hand, "are" in the matrix clause is markedas plural, and "sheep", its subject, must also be plural.Under a unification analysis, these facts are explainedin the following way: "sheep" is syntactically unspeci-fied for the feature number.
The process of subject-verbagreement is effected by unification.
Therefore, when"sheep" appears as the subject of a finite verb, unifica-tion will fix its number as singular or plural (unless thefinite verb itself is ambiguous).
(le) is ungrammatical,then, since the values singular and plural cannot unifyand the fact that "sheep" must agree with both "is" and"are" in number would require their unification.This illegal feature configuration is shown in (2).
(2) IV \[num:sg\]\] --.
\[N \[num:{sg,pl}\]\] ,-- IV \[num:pl\]\]("is") ("sheep") ("are")Here, the arrows indicate the notional flow of informa-tion under agreement, but have no theoretical status.They indicate that agreement between "sheep" and "is"would set "sheep" 's number feature to singular, whileagreement with "axe" would set it to plural More gen-erally, the unification approach to agreement rules outthe following configuration:(3) *\[X \[F:a\]\] -~ \[36 \[F:{a, ;3}\]\] #- \[Z \[F:~\]\]Here \[F : z\] denotes feature F, with value z, and\[F : {z,g}\] indicates feature F with value either z orV, z and Y distinct.
Thus, this schema indicates that acategory which is specified for the values a and B forfeature F cannot simultaneously agree in this featurewith categories that specify distinct values for F. In therest of this section, I will show cases of constructionswhich match this schema but are still grammatical.2.1 Case  1: German Free  Re la t ivesIn German, as Groos and van Riemsdijk (1979) demon-strate, free relative clauses require that the relative pro-noun agree in Case both with the position of the rela-five clause as a whole and also with the position withwhich the relative pronoun is construed (i.e.
with thegap which the relative pronoun fills).
This is shownin (4) and (5), where the matrix verb and the verb inthe flee relative are annotated with the Case the relativepronoun must bear in that clause.
(4) a. Wer nicht stark ist, muss klug sein.who not strong is must clever beNOM NOM NOM'whoever isn't strong must be clever.'b.
*Wen Gott schwach geschaffen hat, muss klug sein.Ace  ACC NOM*Wer Gott schwach geschaffen hat, muss klug sein.NOM ACC NOMwho God weak created has must clever be'Who(m)ever God has created weak must be clever.
'(5) a. Ich nehme, wen du mir empfiehlst.I take who you me recommendACC ACC ACC'I take whomever you recommend to me.'b.
*Ich nehme, wen du vertraust.ACC ACC DAT*Ich nehme, were du vertraust.ACC DAT DATI take who you trust' I take whomever you trust.
'Assuming that "Case assignment" is actually a formof agreement between a verb and a noun phrase that itgoverns, the data in (4)-(5) seems to fit nicely intoa unification approach.
However, the neuter fee  rel-ative pronoun was, which is both nominative and ac-cusative, can seemingly agree with both nominative andaccusative Case assigning elements at the same time:(6) Was du mix gegeben hast, ist p~chtig.What you me given have is wonderfulNOM/ACC ACC NOM'What you have given to me is wonderful.
'(7) Ich habe gegessen was noch tlbrig war.I have eaten what still left wasAce  NOM/ACC NOM'I ate what was left.
'Note that sentences (6) and (7) are precisely in-stances of schema (3), just as (le) is.
Hence, if theexplanation of the ungrammaticality of (le) is correct,we should expect (6) and (7) to be ungrammatical.

2 Assume that Case in German is not asingle-valued feature, but rather an array of the differ-ent Cases of the language, each of which takes on oneof the values T or NIL.
We can then handle the dataabove with the following feature specifications.
(The(a) representations use a "path" notation, consisting ofattribute-value pairs, like that in Shieber (1986); whilethe (b) representations u e a term notation, with posi-tional features, like that in Definite Clause Grammars(Pereira and Warren (1980)).

(CASE ?val ?val ?val T)(14) vertraust:a.

(CASE ?val ?val T ?val)Similarly, the Case specification for nominativeCase assignment, whether this is a property of syntacticstructures or of particular lexical items, would be:(15) a.
\[case: \[nom: T\]\]b.
(CASE T ?val ?val ?val)This solution works, then, because was,  and noother free relative pronouns, specifies the value T for2This possibility was pointed out to me by Andy Haas.more than one element in its Case array and becauseverbs and other Case "assigning" elements only specifya value for the Case they "assign", and for no others.This solution of factoring out seemingly contradictoryvalues for a single feature into values of different fea-tures allows us to get around the superficial violation ofthe schema in (3).
However, there axe other construc-tions which are harder to decompose in this fashion.2.2 Case  2: Hungar ian  WH Movementand  Top ica l i za t ionLet us now turn to a more complicated example, fromHungarian, described in Szamosi (1976).
In Hungarian,WH words, like full NPs, are marked as either definiteor indefinite.
The verb in Hungarian is also marked asdefinite or indefinite, in agreement with its complement.When the complement is an accusative noun phrase, thedefiniteness marking on verb and noun phrase is thesame.
(16) a. Akart egy kOnyvet.he-wanted a book-DEF  -DEFb.
*Akarta egy kSnyvet.he-wanted a book+DEF -DEF'He wanted a book.'c.
*Akart a k0nyvet.he-wanted the book-DEF  +DEFd.
Akarta a kSnyvet.he-wanted the book+DEF +DEF'He wanted the book.'e.
Egy k0nyv amit akarta book which he-wanted-DEF  -DEFf.
*Egy kt~nyv arnit akartaa book which he-wanted-DEF  +DEF'A book which he wantedg.
*Ez az a k0nyv amelyiket akartthis that the book which he-wanted+DEF -DEFh.
Ez az a k0nyv amelyiket akartathisthat hebook which he-wanted+DEF +DEF'This book is the one which he wanted.
'When the complement is a finite clause, the verb bearsdefinite agreement.196(17) a. J/lnos akarta, hogy elhozzak egy k0nyvet.John wanted that I-bring a book+DEF +DEFb.
*Janos akart, hogy elhozzak egy kOnyvet.John wanted that I-bring a book-DEF +DEF'John wanted me to bring a book.
'Finally, WH phrases and topicalized constituents inHungarian typically appear immediately preceding theverb; verb and WH word or topic~ized noun phrasemust agree in definiteness.
3 From these constraints, itfollows that WH phrases and topicalized noun phrasesextracted from complement clauses must be markeddefinite.
Since the clausal complement forces the verbto bear definite agreement, and since the WH word ortopicalized N-P must agree with the verb in definiteness,the WH word or topicalized NP can only be definite.This is shown in the following examples:b.
\ [NP \[def.
'-\] --, IV \[def.-{+,-}\] ,-- \[c \[def:+\]("egy kt~nyv") ("akartam') ("hogy")Let us consider the consequences of expanding outthe definiteness feature into an array of separate values,analogous to the German example.
First, this wouldrequire the underspecified verb forms to be representedas in (23).
(23) akam{u~,akartam:a.
\[definiteness: \[definite: T\] \[indefinite: T\]\]b.
(DEFINITENESS T T)Next, it would require that the WH pronouns be speci-fied as in (24) and (25):(24) amelyiket:a.
\[definiteness: \[definite: T\]\]b.
(DEFINITENF~S T ?val)(25) amit(18) Ez az a k/~nyv amelyiket akartathis that thebook which he-wanted that I-bring+DEF +DEF +DEF +DEF'This is the book which he wanted me to bring.
'(19) *Egy k0nyv amit akarta hogy elhozzak.a book which he-wanted that I-bring-DEF +DEF +DEF-DEF'A book which he wanted me to bring.
'However, certain Hungarian verb forms 4 bear anending which is ambiguous between definite and indef-inite.
In sentences involving such verbs, the WH wordmay be indefinite.
(20) A k0nyv amit akarn~mk, hogy elhozzon.the book which we-would-want that he-brings-DEF ~DEF +DEF-DEF'The book which we would want him to bring.
'(21) Egy kOnyv akartam, hogy elhozzon.a book 1-wanted that he-brings-DEF +DEF +DEF-DEF'It was a book that I wanted him to bring.
'Once again, the grammatical (20) and (21) matchthe prohibited schema (3) Cc" = "complementizer"):(22) a.

\[definiteness: \[indefinite: T\]\]b.
(DEFINITENESS ?val T)Note that when either of these pronouns appearedwith an underspecified definite and indefinite verb, suchas those in (23), it would wind up with the definitenessspecification i  (23).
This would totally neutralize thedefiniteness~ndefiniteness contrast in such cases.
But,in fact, no such ambiguity of interpretation is reported:a definite or indefinite WH phrase or topicalized nounphrase that appears in the suitable configuration withone of these ambiguously definite or indefinite verbs isinterpreted as uniquely definite or indefinite, as is con-sistent with its overt maddng, and not as ambiguousbetween definite and indefinite, as the proposed unifi-cation analysis would require.
Thus, this unificationbased solution to a problem of a morphological mbi-guity entails an ambiguity of interpretation that is notattested.Moreover, aside from the empirically incorrect pre-dictions about semantic interpretation, there is a morefundamental problem with the unification account ofagreement.
As was pointed out above, treating agree-ment as unification implies that structures meeting theschema in (3) should be superficially ungrammatical.
Infact, this seems to be universally false: in every case innatural language in which an element does not molpho-logically distinguish between two or more values of afeatureqa situation often referred to as morphologicalneutralization---it behaves as if this distinction is alsoneutralized for purposes of agreement.
That is, insteadof the configuration i (3) being universally ruled out,197it is universally attested.
This creates a paradox, sincethe ungrammaticality of (le) seems to depend on theungrammaticality of structures matching the configura-tion in (3).
To demonstrate hat this seeming paradox issupported by the data, in the rest of this section, otherexamples will be presented to show that the configura-tion ruled out in (3) recurs again and again across thelanguages of the world.2.3 Case  3: Ob jects  o f  Con jo ined  VPsIn French, as Kayne (1975) points out, it is possible toconjoin past participles following the past auxiliary anda weak Cclitic") object pronoun which is the commonobject of the conjoined participles, under the require-ment hat the verbs of the conjuncts assign the pronounthe same Case.

There seemsto be evidence, in the form of ungramatical utterancessuch as (le), that the configuration in (3) is ungram-matical.
However, the rest of  the section presentedevidence from different constructions and different lan-guages which strongly indicates that (3) is the stan-dard agreement configuration throughout the languagesof the world.
In this section, I will resolve this paradoxby proposing that agreement is not effected by unifi-cation and but rather by a test for non-distinctness offeature values.3,1 Neut ra l i za t ion  versus  Ambigu i tyFirst, let us return to example (le), repeated here forconvenience(38) *The sheep that is ready are there.Recall that the analysis of this utterance which arguedfor the ungrammaticality of configuration (3) was basedon the assumption that "sheep" is unspecified or under-specified for number.
Note that this analysis is tenableif syntactic features alone are considered: syntactically,it seems plausible that "sheep" either has no numberfeature or that it has a variable, rather than a constant,as the value of this feature.
However, when the ramifi-cations of this analysis for semantics are considered, itbecomes less tenable: while syntactic frameworks havebeen constructed in which features can take on under-specified values, most semantic frameworks require fea-tures such as singular/plural to be fully specified.
Thatis, semantically, "sheep" can denote an individual ora set of individuals 5 but it cannot denote somethingindeterminate.
This suggests that "sheep" is not un-derspe?ified, or vague, but rather ambiguous.
That is,there is not a single representation for "sheep", whichis underspecified for number, but rather two distinctentries, fully specified for number in both its syntacticand semantic aspects.
I f  this is the case, the reason that(38) is ungrammatical is not that unification has filledin the underspecified value for number, but rather thatsubject-verb agreement disambiguates which of the twosenses of "sheep" has been encountered and once one of5Nothing in the present argument hinges on this being the correctUeatrnent ofthe singular/plural distinction.
Itdoes not matter whichof the various proposals about the semantic interpretation of umber ischosen.
All that matters i that semantic theories require that singularand plural have different denotations, and do not allow indeterminaterepresentations.the fully specified entries is chosen, it naturally cannotagree with a constituent which bears a distinct number.Once utterances like (38) are analyzed as not match-ing the agreement configuration in (3), it is possibleto handle all the cases of  morphological neutralizationdiscussed in the previous ection.
Note that the featureinvolved in each example of neutralization discussed--Case in German and French, and definiteness on verbsin Hungarian---is either inherently formal, without se-mantic content (Case) or a feature that does not haveany semantic ramification for the category in which itis neutralized: definiteness does affect the interpretationof noun phrases, but it serves purely as a formal agree-ment marker on verbs.
If this observation is correct,then the solution to the apparent paradox runs alongthe following lines:?
Syntactic features which have semantic ramifica-tions, such as number on nouns, tense on verbs,degree on adjectives, are never neutralized (under-specified).
They are always fully specified anditems which seem to be underspecified with re-gard to them are, in fact, ambiguous items withdistinct, fully specified representations.
(But seethe discussion in the Section 4.)?
Purely formal syntactic features, on the other hand,can be neutralized, producing truly underspecifiedrepresentations, either through the use of  value dis-junction or through the use of  a variable, ratherthan a constant, as a feature value.
6?
Agreement is effected not by unification but ratherby a non.distinctness check.That is, since we can view unification as logicallycomposed of two parts---variable checking and variablesubstitution---agreement should be analyzed as involv-ing only variable-matching, but not variable substitu-tion.
This would explain why constituents hat neutral-ize a syntactic feature distinction are universally able tobehave as if they are simultaneously marked for all thevalues of the feature that they neutralize: since agree-ment only involves variable matching, but not variablesubstitution, the original, underspecified representationis always available for agreement.To make this proposal clearer, I will present ananalysis of the German and Hungarian facts, 7 using a6Pullum and Zwicky (1986, p. 766) make a similar distinction be-tween features "freely chosen" vs. those "syntactically imposed...byrules of agreement ... or govemmenf'.7For concreteness, I have analyzed nominative Case assignmentas being a property of verbs in German.
It is possible that his is a199term structure type notation, and adding the :OR op-erator, which introduces disjunctions of variable-freeterms, sGerman:Item: Case:wer (nom)wem (dat)wen (arc)was (:or (nora) (acc))empfiehlst... (arc)vertraust (dat)ist,war... (nom)Hungarian:Item: Definite:amit ( - )amelyikethogy(+)(+)akart ( - )akarta (+)akarn@~k,akartam ?valThese representations are matched by a non-distinctness check, which performs the same tests asunification.
However, the non-distinctness check dif-fers from unification in what it returns.
Unification,when applied to two expressions, typically returns ei-ther a distinguished symbol, such as Fai l ,  i f  they do notunify, or a single substitution expression, which is themost general unifier of its input; see e.g.
Pereira andShieber (1987, pp.
63-64).
When two expressions areidentical, this substitution expression is empty, since nosubstitutions need to be performed.
In this case, then,unification effectively leaves its input unchanged.
Thus,unification can be viewed as returning a single indicatorof failure and an unbounded set of substitution expres-sions.
Non-distinctness checking, on the other hand,returns a single indicator of failure but also a singleindicator of success--an empty substitution expression.Alternatively, non-distinctness checking may be view-ing as determining that two expressions are unifiable,without actually unifying them.The following table contrasts the behavior of  unifi-cation (U) and non-distinctness (~):property of structures instead; however, the Case specification f theappropriate structure would be the same as here.
A similar consider-ation holds for Hungarian, where the property of a direct sententialcomplement triggering definite verb agreement might be either a lex-ical or structural property.SFor a full discussion of the issues involved in adding disjunctionto complex-fealm'e based formalisms, ee Karttamen (1984), Kasperand Rounds (1986), Kasper (1987), and Iohnson (1989).Case:1. z, y are variable-freeand non-disjunctive:a. z=yb.

otherwise: Fail Failwhere MGU(z,  y) is the most general unifier of z, y;NIL is the empty substitution expression;and (a ,--- t )  indicates a substitution expression inwhich fl substitutes for a.
9In examples (4) and (5) in German, and (16) - -(19) in Hungarian, clause 1 applies.
Since the termsinvolved in the agreements in all these examples arevariable-fi'ee, the results are identical under the unifi-cation and non-distincmess analyses.
In the Germanexamples (6) and (7), which involve was, clauses 4 and5 are the relevant ones, and it is here that the differencebetween the unification approach to agreement and thenon-distinctness approach is apparent.
Under the unifi-cation approach, once the disjunctive Case feature valueassociated with was unifies with a fully specified Casefeature, a substitution list is produced that replaces thedisjunction with one of its values:(39) (:or (nom) (arc)) U (nom)((:or (nom) (arc)),--(nom))On the other hand, the non-distincmess check returns anull subsitution, so that the disjunction remains, allow-ing the Case feature of was to agree with distinct valuesof Case on different applications of non-distinctness.
(40) a.
(:or (nom) (acc)) ~ (nom)) =~ NILb.
(:or (nom) (acc)) ~ (arc)) => NIL9Note that his is an extension of the standard conception ofsub-stitution" in systems without disjunction, in which a term substitutesfor a variable, but not for a variable-free term.
However, the additionof disjunction requires such an extension.200A similar analysis holds for examples (20) and (21)in Hungarian; in these cases, it is clause 2 which isrelevant.The treatment of the conjoined verb phrase facts inSection 2.3 is analogous to that of the cases already dis-cussed.
However, one point is worth discussing here.It has not yet been made clear how it is that the objectof the conjoined verb phrase is able to agree separatelywith each verb in the conjunct.
While it might be pos-sible to handle this mechanically by postulating somespecial percolation rule that combines the features ofthe conjuncts together into some underspecified or dis-junctive form, there is a much more straightforwardsolution, namely, to postulate that the examples in Sec-tion 2.3 are generated by ellipsis.
Certainly, given thestrong lexical thrust of recent grammatical frameworks,in which syntactic structures, such as verbal comple-ment structures, are projected from lexical representa-tions, it is hard to see how such examples could not beanalyzed as cases of ellipsis, at least in conligurationallanguages.
Thus, example (28) would be analyzed asin (42) rather than (41).
(41) nous a \[vP \[vp frappe\] et\[vP donn~ des coups de pied\]\](42) \[vP \[vP nous a frapp4\] et\[vF, \[xP e\] \[v e\] donn4 des coups de pied\]\]In non-configurational l nguages, since comple-ments may not be localized in any fixed position, someother mechanism for associating a head with its com-plements i  needed, independent of these neutralizationfacts.
In an active-objects approach to syntax, such asthat outlined in Ingria and Pustejovsky (1990), message-passing would be the logical way of associating a headwith its complements and would extend to the conjunc-tion cases, as well.
In any event, whatever mechanismis operative in the non-conjunctive case should also ap-ply to the conjoined case.3.2 Re la ted  WorkThis paper is not the first to consider the problem thatneutralization facts pose for theories of agreement.
Inparticular, Zaenen and Karttunen (1984) and Pullumand Zwicky (1986) consider data of the type presentedin Sections 2.3 and 2.4.
However, the analysis of agree-ment proposed here seems more general in a number ofways.
1?loin all fairness, Zaenen and Karttunen and Pullum and Zwickyalso consider aspects of conjunction and agreement that fall outsidethe scope of the present paper.While the earlier analyses only considered neutral-ization in the context of conjoined structures, as in Sec-tions 2.3 and 2.4, this paper has examined the problemin general.
In particular, the solutions proposed by Za-enen and KartOmen and Pullum and Zwicky cruciallydepend on the neutralized item standing in an agreementrelation with a conjunction and, hence, cannot extend tocases of neutralization that do not involve conjunction.While Zaenen and Karttunen and Pullum andZwicky agree with the present analysis in associatingthe neutralized constisment with each conjunct of theconjunction directly, rather than through the conjunc-tion as a whole, both of their analyses require this asso-ciation to be stated as a separate principle.
If the briefsketch presented at the end of the preceding section iscorrect, no such stipulation is necessary.
Rather, thebehavior of neutralization with respect o conjunctionfollows from the interaction of the general agreementprocedure with the way in which heads are associatedwith their complements.Zaenen and Karttunen leave the bulk of the ques-tion of what features can be neutralized as a researchtopic.
Pullum and Zwicky, on the other hand, limitneutralization to those features imposed by agreement.This is essentially the position argued for here, althoughthere are subtle differences between the two proposalsand some problematic data (which we will return to inSection 4).
However, this proposal does seem to befundamentally correct, and, combined with the view ofagreement as non-distinctness, yields a more empiri-cany valid theory of agreement than one which equatesunification with agreement or which limits the effectsof neuWalization to conjoined structures.Moreover, this view of agreement should contributeto the portability of natural anguage systems acrosslanguages.
While it might be possible to reconcile thetype of agreement behavior discussed here with a for-realism in which unification is used for agreement bythe use of arrays of feature values or some even morebyzantine mechanism, such an approach would increasethe fragility of any system embodying it.
In a theorysuch as the one here, it should be possible to distin-guish cases of ambiguity firom cases of neutralizationstraightforwardly and to assign the appropriate repre-sentation accordingly.
In a system that tried to maintainthe use of unification for agreement by means of elab-orated representations, the designer of a grammar for anew language would be faced with the problem of eitherusing the elaborated representation for all cases of mor-phological underspecification, a d, perhaps, blowing upthe size and complexity of the grammar, or reserving201the elaborated representation for just those forms whichenter into an agreement relation.
This would require athorough study of all the morphological forms of thelanguage and the constructions they enter into beforefeature structures could be designed and might entaillarge scale changes later if previously unnoticed casesof neutralization were discovered.3.3 The  P lace  o f  Un i f i ca t ion  in GrammarThe proposal that agreement is not effected by unifica-tion does not, however, mean that unification plays norole in grammar.
On the contrary: in most complex-feature based systems, semantic features axe also full-fledged parts of syntactic representations and unifica-tion is used to build up more complex terms out ofsimpler or less specified terms and to build up formu-las out of terms, n There is no argument at all in thedata presented here that unification does not continueto play this role.
In fact, there is a certain histori-cal niceness in the picture of grammar that has beendeveloped here: variable matching (non-distinctness) iused to effect agreement, and variable substitution (uni-fication) is used to build up semantic representations.The reason why this view is historically satisfying isthat it corresponds to views of agreement and seman-tic interpretation that were independently developed intheoretical and computational linguistics.
In the ear-liest forms of generative grammar, it was recognizedthat certain constructions, uch as the various types ofellipsis, depended on a notion of identity.
Over theyears, this notion of identity was refined into one ofnon-distinctness.
Two linguistic representations agreeif they are non-distinct from one another;, they do notneed to be identical (see Chomsky (1965, p. 181)).The view of agreement presented here accords with thiswell-established view.
The use of unification for build-ing up semantic representations, in turn, is based onRobinson's (1965) work on resolution theorem proving.Thus, using unification to build up semantic represen-tat'ions, but not for agreement, returns it to somethingclose to its original use.There are two other places where unification mayplay a role in grammar, although other mechanisms arealso possibile in these cases.
The first is feature per-colation and the second is the use of empty categories,such as traces.
Whereas agreement has been used hereto mean matching of features between sister nodes, typi-11S?e Percira nd Warren (1980), Shieber (1986), and Pereira ndShieber (1987) for more detailed discussion ofsemantic interpretationin complex-feature based grammars.cally of distinct categories, feature-percolation nvolvesthe matching of features between one constituent anda constituent which it dominates, where the dominat-ing constituent is a projection of the dominated, in thesense of the X-Bar theory of phrase structure (Chore-sky (1970), lackendoff (1977)).
For example, a nounphrase has the same person and number features as itshead noun, a verb phrase, the tense and mood of itshead verb, etc.
Unification has typically been used toeffect feature-percolation a d nothing in the data pre-sented here suggests that it is wrong to use unificationfor this purpose.
And while the proposal that agreementand feature-percolation arehandled by different mecha-nisms is not usual in complex-feature based grammars,it is also not unprecedented.
Ross's (1981) Local Gram-mar formalism is a complex-feature based grammar inwhich feature percolation and agreement are distinct.Finally, unification has been used to "pass" fea-tures between a "dislocated" element and its trace.
Hereagain, unification remains a viable mechanism.
How-ever, there are alternatives mechanisms for both thesefunctions, such as inheritance and delegation, whoseuse should probably be investigated.4 Future  ResearchThere are a number of theoretical and practical issuesthat the analysis presented here raises.
Their discussionwill conclude this paper.First of all, there is the question of how the non-distinctness test for agreement can be incorporated intoa system in which unification is used for semantic in-terpretation and other purposes.
Since non-distinctnessreturns a subset of the values returned by unifica-tion, interaction between non-distinctness and unifica-tion should be straightforward.
However, a system us-ing both these mechanisms would also need to containsome method for specifying which features of whichconstituems are subject to unification and which aresubject to non-distinctness.
This suggests the neces-sity of some sort of type declaration system, in whichfeatures are declared as semantically relevant or notfor a particular category.
The BBN ACFG formalism(Boisen 1989a,b), a form of Definite Clause Grammar,already includes a type declaration system, which hasproven very useful for maintaining the consistency oflarge grammars.
It should be possible to extend thiskind of type system to the degree of delicacy requiredby a system incorporating both unification and non-distinctness.202A more problematic ssue is the exact specificationof the features which can be neutralized and those whichcan be ambiguous, and their contexts.
In Section 3.1, itwas suggested that semantically relevant features enterinto ambiguity relations, while all others produce neu-tralization.
However, the notion of semantic relevancemay need to be refined.
Zaenen and Kartunnen (1984)produce examples uch as the following:(43) der Antrag des oder der Dozententhe petition the or the docent(s)SG PL GEN-SG/GEN-PL'the petition of the docent or docents'(44) *Ich have den Dozenten gesehen und geholfen.I have the docent(s) seen and helpedA-SG/D-PL ACC DAT'!
have seen the docent and helped the docents.
'Example (44), which by the account presented herewould involve the attempted neutralization of number,a semantically relevant feature, is ungrammatical, justas is predicted.
However, (43), which also seems toinvolve the attempted neutralization of number, is un-expectedly grammatical.
Zaenen and Karttunen alsopresent an example from Finnish parallel to (43):(45) He luldvat hanen uusimman _jaThey read his newest andGEN-SGme hanen parhaat _ kirjansa.we his best book(s)NOM-PL GEN-SG/NOM-PL'They read his newest book and we his best books.
'Here again, number, a semantically relevant feature,appears to be neutralized.
Although Zaenen and Kart-tunen's treaUnent of neutralization is different from thatsuggested here is several respects, they suggest a cru-cial difference between (43) and (45) on the one handand (44) on the other that may carry over.
In (44), theconstitutent level at which neutralization is attempted isthat of the phrase (N-P), whereas in (43) and (45) it is atthe level of the pre-tenninal (N).
Zaenen and Karttunen(1984, p. 317) suggest that the neutralization is possibleat the one level but not the other because "reference isassigned to noun phrases, not to common nouns."
Or,in the terms we have been using here, number is se-mantically relevant for noun phrases, but not nouns.
12Clearly, more research needs to be done to determine12In our work on the BBN AC l~ system (Boisen 1989e, b), wehave also found that features such as number, degree, and tense seemto have their semantic effect at the phrasal level, rather than that ofif the proposed istinction is valid or not.
Moreover, ifit is valid, the theory of feature percolation eeds to bemodified to allow number to be neutralized at the levelof N, but to produce ambiguity at the level of NP.Finally, one issue that has not yet been mentionedis that of speaker preferences.
While the discussionin Section 2 treated constructions involving the neu-tralized forms as perfectly grammatical, variation inspeaker judgement has been reported.
Thus, Zaenen andKarttunen (1984) comment that some Icelandic speak-ers reject (30b) as well as (30a).
Pullum and Zwicky(1986) present similar sorts of judgements for other con-sU'uctions.
Moreover, there axe also judgements in theopposite direction.
For example, Modern Greek, unlikeGerman, does not require that the relative pronoun in afree relative clause have a Case compatible with both itssource and superficial positions; see, for example Mack-ridge (1985, pp.
259ff) for discussion.
This meansthat the Modem Greek equivalents of (4b) and (5b) aregrammatical.
Nevertheless, ome speakers 13, while ac=cepting such sentences as grammatical, report hat sen=tences containing a free relative pronoun which neu-tralizes the abstract Case conflict are somewhat moreacceptable.
These facts set us a broader esearch goal:that of proposing a theory of agreement which does notproduce simple binary grammaticality statements butone which is capable of estimating degrees of relativegrammaticality.
Since the necessity of such a finer-grained theory of grammaticality is becoming more andmore obvious in computational linguistics as a whole,it is no surprise to find it appearing in the study ofagreement, as well.5 AcknowledgmentsThe work reported here was supported by the AdvancedResearch Projects Agency and was monitored by theOffice of Naval Research under Contract No.
