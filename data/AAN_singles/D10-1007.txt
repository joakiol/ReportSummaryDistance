In the first stage, weuse an unsupervised probabilistic approach tomodel and extract multiple viewpoints in text.We experiment with a variety of lexical andsyntactic features, yielding significant perfor-mance gains over bag-of-words feature sets.In the second stage, we introduce Compara-tive LexRank, a novel random walk formula-tion to score sentences and pairs of sentencesfrom opposite viewpoints based on both theirrepresentativeness of the collection as well astheir contrastiveness with each other.
Exper-imental results show that the proposed ap-proach can generate informative summaries ofviewpoints in opinionated text.1 IntroductionThe amount of opinionated text available online hasbeen growing rapidly, increasing the need for sys-tems that can summarize opinions expressed in suchtext so that a user can easily digest them.
In this pa-per, we study how to summarize opinionated text ina such a way that highlights contrast between multi-ple viewpoints, which is a little-studied task.Usually, online opinionated text is generated bymultiple people, and thus often contains multi-ple viewpoints about an issue or topic.
A view-point/perspective refers to ?a mental position fromwhich things are viewed?
(cf.
WordNet).
An opin-ion is usually expressed in association with a partic-ular viewpoint, even though the viewpoint is usually?Now at Johns Hopkins University (mpaul@cs.jhu.edu).not explicitly given; for example, a blogger that isin favor of a policy would likely look at the positiveaspects of the policy (i.e., positive viewpoint), whilesomeone against the policy would likely empha-size the negative aspects (i.e., negative viewpoint).Moreover, in an opinionated text with diverse opin-ions, the multiple viewpoints taken by opinion hold-ers are often ?contrastive?, leading to opposite po-larities.
Indeed, such contrast in opinions may be amain driving force behind many online discussions.Futhermore, opinions regarding news events andother short-term issues may quickly emerge and dis-appear.
Such opinions may reflect many differ-ent types of viewpoints which cannot be modeledby current systems.
For this reason, we believethat a viewpoint summarization system would ben-efit from the ability to extract unlabeled viewpointswithout supervision.
Even if such clustering has in-accuracies, it could still be a useful starting point forhuman editors to select representative excerpts.Thus, given a set of opinionated documents abouta topic, we aim at automatically extracting and sum-marizing the multiple contrastive viewpoints implic-itly expressed in the opinionated text to facilitatedigestion and comparison of different viewpoints.Specifically, we will generate two types of multi-view summaries: macro multi-view summary andmicro multi-view summary.
A macro multi-viewsummary would contain multiple sets of sentences,each representing a different viewpoint; these differ-ent sets of sentences can be compared to understandthe difference of multiple viewpoints at the ?macrolevel.?
A micro multi-view summary would con-tain a set of pairs of contrastive sentences (each pair66consists of two sentences representing two differentviewpoints), making it easy to understand the differ-ence between two viewpoints at the ?micro level.
?Although opinion summarization has been exten-sively studied (e.g., (Liu et al, 2005; Hu and Liu,2004; Hu and Liu, 2006; Zhuang et al, 2006)), ex-isting work has not attempted to generate our envi-sioned contrastive macro and micro multi-view sum-maries in an unsupervised way, which is the goal ofour work.
For example, Hu and Liu (2006) rank sen-tences based on their dominant sentiment accordingto the polarity of adjectives occuring near a productfeature in a sentence.
A contradiction occurs whentwo sentences are highly unlikely to be simultane-ously true (cf.
(Marneffe et al, 2008)).
Althoughlittle work has been done on contradiction detection,there are a few notable approaches (Harabagiu et al,2006; Marneffe et al, 2008; Kim and Zhai, 2009).The closest work to ours is perhaps that of Ler-man and McDonald (2009) who present an approachto contrastive summarization.
They add an objectiveto their summarization model such that the summarymodel for one set of text is different from the modelfor the other set.
The idea is to highlight the keydifferences between the sets, however this is a dif-ferent type of contrast than the one we study here ?our goal is instead to make the summaries similar toeach other, to contrast how the same information isconveyed through different viewpoints.In this paper, we propose a two-stage approachto solving this novel summarization problem, whichwill be explained in the following two sections.2 Modeling ViewpointsThe first challenge to be solved in order to generatea contrastive summary of multiple viewpoints is tomodel and extract these viewpoints which are hiddenin text.
In this paper we propose to solve this chal-lenge by employing the Topic-Aspect Model (TAM)(Paul and Girju, 2010), which is an extension of theLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model (Blei et al,2003) for jointly modeling topics and viewpoints intext.
While most existing work on such topic models(including TAM) has taken a topic model as a gen-erative model for word tokens in text, we propose totake TAM as a generative model for more complexlinguistic features extracted from text.
These aremore discriminative than single word tokens and canimprove the accuracy of extracting multiple view-points as we will show in the experimental results?section.
Below we first give a brief introduction toTAM and then present the proposed set of features.2.1 Topic-Aspect Model (TAM)LDA-style probabilistic topic models of documentcontent (Blei et al, 2003) have been shown to offerstate-of-the-art summarization quality.
Such mod-els also provide a framework for adding additionalstructure to a summarization model (Haghighi andVanderwende, 2009).
In our case, we want to addmore structure to a model to incorporate the notionof viewpoint/perspective into our summaries.When it comes to extracting viewpoints, recent re-search suggests that it may be beneficial to modelboth topics and perspectives, as sentiment may beexpressed differently depending on the issue in-volved (Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Paul and Girju,2010).
For example, let?s consider a set of productreviews for a home theater system.
Content topicsin this data might include things like sound qual-ity, usability, etc., while the viewpoints might bethe positive and negative sentiments.
A word likespeakers, for instance depends on the sound topicbut not a viewpoint, while good would be an exam-ple of a word that depends on a viewpoint but notany particular topic.
A word like loud would dependon both (since it would be considered positive senti-ment only in the context of the sound quality topic),while a word like think depends on neither.We make use of a recent model, the Topic-AspectModel (Paul and Girju, 2010), which can modelsuch behavior with or without supervision.
Underthis model, a document has a mixture over topics aswell as a mixture over viewpoints.
The two mix-tures are drawn independently of each other, andthus can be thought of as two separate clustering di-mensions.
A word is associated with variables de-noting its topic and viewpoint assignments, as wellas two binary variables to denote if the word de-pends on the topic and if the word depends on theviewpoint.
A word may depend on the topic, theviewpoint, both, or neither, as in the above example.The generative process for a document d underthis model can be briefly described as follows.
Foreach word in a document:671.
Sample a topic z from P (z|d) and a viewpoint vfrom P (v|d).2.
Sample a ?level?
` ?
{0, 1} from P (`|d).
Thisdetermines if the word will depend on the topic (topicallevel) or not (background level).3.
Sample a ?route?
r ?
{0, 1} from P (r|`, z).
Thisdetermines if the word will depend on the viewpoint.4.
Sample a word w from P (w|z, v, r, `).The probabilities are multinomial/binomial dis-tributions with Dirichlet/Beta priors, and thus thismodel falls under the standard LDA framework.
Thenumber of topics and number of viewpoints are pa-rameters that must be specified.
Inference can bedone with Gibbs sampling (Paul and Girju, 2010).TAM naturally gives us a very rich output touse in a viewpoint summarization application.
Ifwe are doing unsupervised viewpoint extraction,we can use the output of the model to computeP (v|sentence) which could be used to generatesummaries that contain only excerpts that stronglyhighlight one viewpoint over another.
Similarly,we could use the learned topic mixtures to generatetopic-specific summaries.
Futhermore, the variablesr and ` tell us if a word is dependent on the view-point and topic, and we could use this informationto focus on sentences that contain informative con-tent words.
Note that without supervision, TAM?sclustering is based only on co-occurrences and thepatterns it captures may or may not correspond withthe viewpoints we wish to extract.
Nonetheless, weshow in this research that it can indeed find mean-ingful viewpoints with reasonable accuracy on cer-tain data sets.
Although we do not explore this inthis paper, additional information about the view-points could be added to TAM by defining priors onthe distributions to further improve the accuracy ofviewpoint discovery.2.2 FeaturesPrevious work with TAM used only bag of wordsfeatures, which may not be the best features for cap-turing viewpoints.
For example, ?Israel attackedPalestine?
and ?Palestine attacked Israel?
are iden-tical excerpts in an exchangable bag of words rep-resentation, yet one is more likely to come from theperspective of a Palestinian and the other from an Is-raeli.
In this subsection, we will propose a variety offeature sets.
We evaluate the utility of these featuresto the task of modeling viewpoints by measuring theaccuracy of unsupervised clustering.2.2.1 WordsWe have experimented with simple bag of wordsfeatures as baseline approaches, both with and with-out removing stop words, and found that the accu-racy of clustering by viewpoint is better when re-taining all words.
This supports the observationthat common function words may have importantpsychological properties (Chung and Pennebaker,2007).
Thus, we do not do any stop word removalfor any of our other feature sets.
We find that we getbetter results by stemming the words, so we applyPorter?s stemmer to all of our features described.2.2.2 Dependency RelationsIt has been shown that using syntactic informationcan improve the accuracy of sentiment models (Joshiand Rose?, 2009).
Thus, instead of representing doc-uments as a bag of words, we will experiment withusing features returned by a dependency parser.
Forthis, we used the Stanford parser1, which returns de-pendency tuples of the form rel(a, b) where rel issome dependency relation and a and b are tokens ofa sentence.
We can use these specific tuples as fea-tures, referred here as the full-tuple representation.One problem with this representation is that weare using very specific information and it is harderfor learning algorithms to find patterns due to thelack of redundancy.
One solution is to generalizethese features and rewrite a tuple rel(a, b) as twotuples: rel(a, ?)
and rel(?, b) (Greene and Resnik,2009; Joshi and Rose?, 2009).
We will refer to this asthe split-tuple representation.2.2.3 NegationIf a word wi appears in the head of a neg rela-tion, then we would like this to be reflected in otherdependency tuples in which wi occurs.
For a tuplerel(wi, wj), if either wi or wj is negated, then wesimply rewrite it as ?rel(wi, wj).An alternative would be to rewrite the individualword wi as ?wi.
However in our experiments thisrepresentation produced worse accuracies, perhapsbecause this produces less redundancy.1http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/682.2.4 PolarityWe also hypothesize that lexical polarity informa-tion may improve our model.
If we are using thefull-tuple representation, then a tuple becomes moregeneral by replacing the specific word with a + or?.
In the case that both words are polarity words,we use two tuples, replacing only one word at atime rather than replacing both words with their po-larity signs.
To determine the polarity of a word,we simply use the Subjectivity Clues lexicon (Wil-son et al, 2005) and as polarity values, positive (+),negative (-), and neutral (*).
Under our split-tuplerepresentation, this becomes more specific by re-placing the ?
with the polarity sign.
For example,the tuple amod(idea, good) would be representedas amod(idea,+) and amod(?, good).
We collapsenegated features to flip the polarity sign such that?rel(a,+) becomes rel(a,?
).2.2.5 Generalized RelationsWe also experimented with backing off the rela-tions themselves.
Since the Stanford dependenciescan be organized in a hierarchy2, we will representthe relations at more generalized levels in the hi-erarchy.
For example, both a direct object and anindirect object are a type of object.
For a relationrel, we define Rrel as the relation above rel inthe hierarchy ?
for example, Rdobj = obj.
Wemake an exception for neg which has its own im-portant properties that we wish to retain, so we letRneg = neg.
Thus, when using these features, werewrite rel(a, b) as Rrel(a, b).3 Multi-Viewpoint SummarizationAs a computation problem, extractive multi-viewpoint summarization would take as input a setof candidate excerpts3 X = {x1, x2, ..., x|X|} withk viewpoints and generate two types of multi-viewcontrastive summaries: 1) A macro contrastive sum-mary Smacro consists of k disjoint sets of excerpts,X1, X2, ..., Xk ?
X with each Xi containing repre-sentative sentences of the i-th view (i.e., Smacro =(X1, ..., Xk)).
The number of excerpts in each Xican be empirically set based on application needs.2The complete hierarchy can be found in the Stanford de-pendencies manual (Marneffe and Manning, 2008).3An ?excerpt?
refers to the smallest unit of text that willmake up our summary such as a sentence.2) A micro contrastive summary Smicro consistsof a set of excerpt pairs, each containing two ex-cerpts from two different viewpoints, i.e., Smicro ={(s1, t1), ..., (sn, tn)} where si ?
X and ti ?
X aretwo comparable excerpts representing two differentviewpoints.
n is the length of the summary, whichcan be set empirically based on application needs.Note that both macro and micro summaries can re-veal contrast between different viewpoints, thoughat different granularity levels.To generate macro and micro summaries basedon the probabilistic assignment of excerpts to view-points given by TAM, we propose a novel extensionto the LexRank algorithm (Erkan and Radev, 2004),a graph-based method for scoring representative ex-cerpts to be used in a summary.
Our key idea is tomodify the definition of the jumping probability inthe random walk model so that it would favor ex-cerpts that represent a viewpoint well and encour-age jumping to an excerpt comparable with the cur-rent one but from a different viewpoint.
As a re-sult, the stationary distribution of the random walkmodel would capture representative contrastive ex-cerpts and allow us to generate both macro and mi-cro contrastive summaries within a unified frame-work.
We now describe this novel summarizationalgorithm (called Comparative LexRank) in detail.3.1 Comparative LexRankLexRank is a PageRank-like algorithm (Page et al,1998), where we define a random walk model ontop of a graph that has sentences to be summarizedas nodes and edges placed between two sentencesthat are similar to each other.
We can then scoreall the sentences based on the expected probabilityof a random walker visiting each sentence.
We usethe short-hand P (xj |xi) to denote the probability ofbeing at node xj at a time t given that the walkerwas at xi at time t ?
1.
The jumping probabilityfrom node xi to node xj is given by:P (xj |xi) =sim(xi, xj)?j?
?X sim(xi, xj?
)(1)where sim is a content similarity function definedon two sentence/excerpt nodes.Our extension is mainly to modify this jumpingprobability in two ways so as to favor visiting con-trastive representative opinions from multiple view-69points.
The first modification is to make it favorjumping to a good representative excerpt x of anyviewpoint v (i.e., with high probability p(v|x) ac-cording to the TAM model).
The second modifica-tion is to further favor jumping between two excerptsthat can potentially form a good contrastive pair foruse in generating a micro contrastive summary.Specifically, under our model, the random walkerfirst decides whether to jump to a sentence of thesame viewpoint or to a sentence of a different view-point.
We define this decision as a binary variablez ?
{0, 1}.
Intuitively, if we can force the ran-dom walker to move back and forth between view-points, then the final scores will favor sentences thatare similar across both viewpoints.We define two different modified similarity func-tions for the two possible values of z.
The first one,sim0 (corresponding to z = 0) scales the similarityby the likelihood that the two x?s represent the sameviewpoint, and the second one, sim1 (for z = 1)scales the similarity by the likelihood that the x?scome from different viewpoints.sim0(xi, xj) = sim(xi, xj)k?m=1P (v = m|xi)P (v = m|xj)sim1(xi, xj) = sim(xi, xj)??m1,m2?
[1,k],m1 6=m2P (v = m1|xi)P (v = m2|xj)where P (v|x) denotes the probability that the ex-cerpt x belongs to the viewpoint v, and in general,can be obtained through any multi-viewpoint model.A special case of this is when the labels for view-points are known, in which case P (v|x) = 1 for thecorrect label and 0 for the others.In our experiments, P (v|x) comes from the out-put of TAM, and we define sim(xi, xj) as the cosinebetween the vectors xi and xj , although again anysimilarity function could be used.
The conditionaltransition probability from xi to xj given z is then:P (xj |xi, z) =simz(xi, xj)?j?
?X simz(xi, xj?
)(2)Using ?
to denote P (z = 0) and marginalizingacross z, we have the transition probability:P (xj |xi) = ?P (xj |xi, z = 0)+ (1??
)P (xj |xi, z = 1)The stationary distribution of the random walkgives us a scoring of the excerpts to be used in oursummary.
It is also possible to score pairs of ex-cerpts that contrast each other.
We define the scorefor a pair (xi, xj) as the probability of being at xiand transitioning to xj or vice versa, where xi andxj are of opposite viewpoints.
Specifically:P (xi)P (xj |xi, z = 1) + P (xj)P (xi|xj , z = 1) (3)3.2 Summary GenerationThe final summary should be a set of excerpts thathave a high relevance score according to our scoringalgorithm, but are not redundant among each other.Many techniques could be used to accomplish this(Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; McDonald, 2007),but we use a simple greedy approach: at each stepof the summary generation algorithm, we add theexcerpt with the highest relevance score as long asthe excerpt?s redundancy score ?
the cosine similar-ity between the candidate and the current summary?
is under some threshold ?.
This is repeated untilthe summary reaches a user-supplied length limit.Macro contrastive summarization: A macro-levelsummary consists of independent summaries foreach viewpoint, which we generate by first using therandom walk stationary distribution across all of thedata to rank the excerpts.
We then separate the top-ranked excerpts into two disjoint sets according totheir viewpoint based on whichever gives a greatervalue of P (v|x), and finally remove redundancy andproduce the summary according to our method de-scribed above.
We refer to this as macro contrastivesummarization, because the summaries will contrasteach other in that they have related content, but theexcerpts in the summaries are not explicitly alignedwith each other.Micro contrastive summarization: A candidateexcerpt for a micro-level summary will consist ofa pair (xi, xj) with the pairwise relevance score de-fined in Equation 3.
We can then rank these pairs andremove redundancy.
It is possible that both xi and xjin a high-scoring pair may belong to the same view-point; such a case would be filtered out since we aremainly interested in including contrastive pairs inour summary.
We refer to this as micro contrastivesummarization, because the summaries will allowus to see contrast at the level of individual excerptsfrom different viewpoints.704 Experiments and Evaluation4.1 Experimental SetupEvaluation of multi-view summarization is challeng-ing as there is no existing data set we can use.
Weleverage the resources on the Web and created twodata sets in the domain of political opinion.Our first dataset is a set of 948 verbatim responsesto a Gallup R?
phone survey about the 2010 U.S.healthcare bill (Jones, 2010), conducted March 4-7,2010.
Responses in this set tend to be short and of-ten incomplete or otherwise ill-formed and informalsentences.
Respondants indicate if they are ?for?
or?against?
the bill, and there is a roughly even mix ofthe two viewpoints (45% for and 48% against).We also use the Bitterlemons corpus, a collectionof 594 editorials about the Israel-Palestine conflict.This dataset is fully described in (Lin et al, 2006)and has been used in other perspective modeling lit-erature (Lin et al, 2008; Greene and Resnik, 2009).The style of this data differs substantially from thehealthcare data in that documents in this set tend tobe long and verbose articles with well-formed sen-tences.
It again contains a fairly even mixture of twodifferent perspectives: 312 articles from Israeli au-thors and 282 articles from Palestinian authors.Moreover, for the healthcare data set, manuallyextracted opinion polls are available on the Web,which we further leverage to construct gold stan-dard summaries to evaluate our method quantita-tively.
The data and test sets are available athttp://apfel.ai.uiuc.edu/resources.html.4.2 Stage One: Modeling ViewpointsThe main research question we want to answer inmodeling viewpoints is whether richer feature setswould lead to better accuracy than word features.We used our various feature sets as input to TAMand measured the accuracy of clustering documentsby viewpoint.
This evaluation serves both to mea-sure how accurately this type of clustering can bedone, as well as to measure which types of featuresare important for modeling viewpoints.We found that the clustering accuracy is improvedif we measure the accuracy of only the subset ofdocuments such that P (v|doc) is greater than somethreshold (we used 0.8).
Thus, the accuraries pre-sented in this section are measured using this confi-dence threshold.
We will use this approach for thesummarization task as well, as it ensures we are onlysummarizing documents where we have high confi-dence about their viewpoint membership.There are several parameters to set for TAM.Since our focus is on comparing linguistic featureswith word features, we simply set these parame-ters to some reasonable values: We used Dirich-let pseudo-counts of 80.0 for P (` = 0), 20.0 forP (` = 1), uniform pseudo-counts of 5.0 for P (x),0.1 for the topic and aspect mixtures, and 0.01 forthe word distributions.
We tell the model to use 2viewpoints as well as 5 topics for the healthcare cor-pus and 8 topics for the Bitterlemons corpus.There is high variance in the accuracies depend-ing on how the Gibbs samplers were initialized.
Wethus repeated the experiments many times to obtainrelatively confident measures ?
200 times for thehealthcare set and 50 times for the Bitterlemons set,with 2000 iterations each time.
A natural way to se-lect a model is to choose the model that gives thehighest likelihood to its input.
To evaluate how wellthis selection strategy would work, we measured thecorrelation between accuracy and likelihood.The results are shown in Table 1.
We can makeseveral observations.
(1) In all cases, the proposedlinguistic features yield higher accuracy than theword features, supporting our hypothesis that forviewpoint modeling, applying TAM to these featuresimproves performance over using simple word fea-tures.
Since virtually all existing work on topic mod-els assumes word tokens as data to be modeled, ourresults suggest that it would be interesting to exploreapplying generative topic models to complex fea-tures for other tasks as well.
This may be because byadding additional complex features to the observeddata, we artificially inflate the data likelihood to em-phasize modeling co-occurrences of such features,which effectively biases the model to capture a cer-tain perspective of co-occurrences.
(2) The increase is substantially greater for theBitterlemons corpus, which may be due to the factthat the parsing accuracy is likely better because thelanguage is formal.
The split-tuple representationis very significantly better for the healthcare corpus,but it is not clear which is better for the Bitterlemonscorpus.
It is also not clear how the generalized rela-tions affect the performance.71Healthcare Corpus Bitterlemons CorpusFeature Set Mean Med Max MaxLL Corr Mean Med Max MaxLL Corrbag of words 61.12 +/- 0.76% 61.01 72.17 52.92 0.187 68.22 +/- 3.31% 69.26 88.27 84.94 0.39- no stopwords 60.58 +/- 0.79% 60.50 72.18 62.58 0.154 61.29 +/- 3.05% 57.69 91.34 82.91 0.33full-tuples 62.42 +/- 0.88% 62.47 74.04 63.37 0.201 80.89 +/- 3.45% 85.40 94.07 92.10 0.34+ negation 63.67 +/- 0.81% 64.54 74.07 69.25 0.338 80.60 +/- 3.88% 88.07 95.61 91.32 0.66+ neg.

(3) It appears that adding polarity helps the full-tuple features (by making them more general) buthurts the split-tuple features (by making them morespecific).
Negation significantly improves the full-tuple features in the Bitterlemons corpus, but it isnot clear if it helps in the other cases.
It should benoted that capturing negation and polarity is a verycomplex and difficult task, and it is not expected thatour simple approaches will accurately capture theseproperties.
Nonetheless, it seems that these simplefeatures may help in certain cases.4.3 Stage Two: Summarizing ViewpointsFor the second stage (i.e., the Comparative LexRankalgorithm), we mainly want to evaluate the qualityof the generated contrastive multi-viewpoint sum-mary and study the effectiveness of our extensionto the standard LexRank.
Below we present exten-sive evaluation of our summarization method on thehealthcare data.
We do not have an evaluation setwith which to compute quantitative metrics on theBitterlemons corpus, so we will instead perform asimple qualitative evaluation in the last subsection.4.3.1 Gold Standard SummariesThe responses to the Gallup healthcare poll aredescribed in an article4 which gives a table of themain responses found in the data along with theirprominence in the data.
In a way, this represents anexpert human-generated summary of our database,and we will use this as a gold standard macro con-trastive summary against which the representative-4http://www.gallup.com/poll/126521/Favor-Oppose-Obama-Healthcare-Plan.aspxness of a multi-viewpoint contrastive summary canbe evaluated.
The reasons given in this table willbe used verbatim as our reference set, excluding theother/no-reason/no-opinion reasons.
A sample ofthis table is shown in Table 2.We also want to develop a reference set for microcontrastive summaries, where we are mainly inter-ested in evaluating contrastiveness.
To do this, weasked 3 annotators to identify contrastive pairs inthe ?main reasons?
table described above.
Each pairmust contain one reason from the ?for?
side and onereason from the ?against?
side, though we do not re-quire a one-to-one alignment; that is, multiple pairsmay contain the same reason.
We take the set ofpairs that were identified as being contrastive by atleast 2 annotators to be our gold set of contrastivepairs.
Because these pairs come from the gold sum-mary, they are still representative of the collection asa whole, rather than fine-grained contrasts.The macro reference set contains 9 ?for?
reasonsand 15 ?against?
reasons.
The micro reference setcontains 13 annotator-identified pairs composed of 9unique ?for?
reasons and 8 unique ?against?
reasons.4.3.2 Baseline ApproachesGraph-based algorithms: The standard LexRankalgorithm can also be used to score pairs of sen-tences according to Equation 3.
We will thus com-pare our new LexRank extension to the unmodifiedform of this algorithm.
When ?
= 1, the randomwalk model only transitions to sentences within thesame viewpoint, and thus in this case our modifiedalgorithm produces the same ranking as the unmod-ified LexRank.
This will be our first baseline.72For AgainstPeople need health insurance/Too many uninsured 29% Will raise costs of insurance/Make it less affordable 20%System is broken/Needs to be fixed 18% Does not address real problems 19%Costs are out of control/Would help control costs 12% Need more information/clarity on how system would work 8%Moral responsibility to provide/Obligation/Fair 12% Against big government/Too much government involvement 8%Table 2: Some of the top reasons given along with their prominence in the healthcare data, as analyzed by Gallup.
This is a sample of what willserve as our gold set.
The highlighted cells show an example of a contrastive pair identified by our annotators.Model-based algorithms: We will also compareagainst the approach of Lerman and McDonald(2009) who introduce their contrastiveness objectiveinto a model-based summarization algorithm.
Thebasic form of this algorithm is to select a set of sen-tences Sm to minimize the KL-divergence betweenthe models of the summary Sm and the entire collec-tion Xm for a viewpoint m. The objective functionis: ?
?km=1KL(L(Sm)||L(Xm)) where L is an ar-bitrary language model.
We define L(A) simply asthe unigram distribution over words in the collectionA, a method also evaluated by Haghighi and Vander-wende (2009).
This is the fairest comparison to ourLexRank experiments, where sentences are also rep-resented as unigrams.
(We do not do any modelingwith TAM in our quantitative evaluation.
)Lerman and McDonald introduce an additionalterm to maximize the KL-divergence between thesummary of one viewpoint and the collection of theopposite viewpoint, so that each viewpoint?s sum-mary is dissimilar to the other viewpoints.
We bor-row this idea but instead do the opposite so that theviewpoints?
summaries are more (rather than less)similar to each other.
This contrastive version of ourmodel-based baseline is formulated as:?k?m1=1KL(L(Sm1)||L(Xm1)) +(1k?1?m2?
[1,k],m1 6=m2KL(L(Sm1)||L(Xm2)))Our summary generation algorithm is to iterativelyadd excerpts to the summary in a greedy fash-ion, selecting the excerpt with the highest score ineach iteration.
Note that this approach only gen-erates macro-level summaries, leaving us with theLexRank baseline for micro-level summaries.4.3.3 MetricsWe will evaluate our summaries using a variant ofthe standard ROUGE evaluation metric (Lin, 2004).Recall that we have two different evaluation sets?
one that contains all of the reasons for each view-point, and one that consists only of aligned pairs ofexcerpts.
Since the same excerpt may appear in mul-tiple pairs, there would be significant redundancy inour reference summary if we were to include everypair.
Thus, we will restrict a contrastive referencesummary to exclude overlapping pairs, and we willhave many reference sets for all possible combina-tions of pairs.
There is only one reference set for therepresentativeness criterion.Our reference summaries have a unique propertyin that the summaries have already been annotatedwith the prominence of the different reasons in thedata.
A good summary should capture the moreprominent statements, so we will include this in ourscoring function.
We thus augment the basic ROUGEn-gram recall score by weighting the n-gram countsin the reference summary according to this percent-age.
This is a generalization of the standard ROUGEformula where this percentage would be uniform.For evaluating the macro-level summaries, wewill score the summaries for the two viewpoints sep-arately, given a reference set Refi and a candidatesummary Ci for a viewpoint v = i.
The final scoreis a combination of the scores for both viewpoints,i.e.
Srep = 0.5S(Refi, Ci)+0.5S(Refj , Cj) whereS(Ref,C) is our ROUGE-based scoring metric.
Itwould also be interesting to measure how well aviewpoint?s summary matches the gold summaryof the opposite viewpoint, which will give insightsinto how well the Comparative LexRank algorithmmakes the two summaries similar to each other.
Wewill measure this as the inverse of the above metric,i.e.
Sopp = 0.5S(Refi, Cj) + 0.5S(Refj , Ci).Finally, to score the micro-level comparative sum-maries (recall that this gives explicitly-aligned pairsof excerpts), we will concatenate each pair (xi, xj)as a single excerpt, and use these as the excerpts inour reference and candidate summaries.
The scor-ing function is then Sp = S(Refpairs, Cpairs).
Notethat we have multiple reference summaries for the73?

Note that ?

MB andMC refer to our model-based baselines described in Subsection 4.3.2.Bold scores are significant over all baselines according to a paired t-test.micro-level evaluation due to overlapping pairs inthe evaluation set.
In this case, the ROUGE scoreis defined as the maximum score among all possiblereference summaries (Lin, 2004).We measure both unigram (removing stop words,denoted S-1) and bigram (retaining stop words, de-noted S-2) recall, stemming words in all cases.4.3.4 Evaluation ResultsIn order to evaluate our Comparative LexRankalgorithm by itself, in this subsection we will notuse the output of TAM as part of our summariza-tion input, and will assign excerpts fixed values ofP (v|x) = 1 for the correct label and 0 otherwise.We constructed our sentence vectors with unigrams(removing stop words) and no IDF weighting.We set the PageRank damping factor (Erkan andRadev, 2004) to 0.01 and tried combinations ofthe redundancy threshold ?
?
{0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2}with different values of ?, the parameter which con-trols the level of contrastiveness.
For each value of?, we optimized ?
on the original data set accordingto Srep?Sopp so that we can directly compare thesescores, and then we tuned ?
separately for Sp.
Thesummary length is 6 excerpts.
To obtain more ro-bust results, we repeated the experiment 100 timeson random half-size subsets of our data.
The scoresshown in Table 3 are averaged across these trials.In general, increasing ?
increases Srep, whichsuggests that tuning ?
behaves as expected, andhigh- and mid-range ?
values indeed produce sum-maries where the summaries of the two viewpointsare more similar to each other.
Similarly, mid-range?
values produce substantially higher values of Sp-1,the unigram ROUGE scores for the micro contrastivesummary, although there is not a large difference be-tween the bigram scores.
An example of our micro-level output is shown in Table 4.As for our model-based baseline, we show resultsfor both the basic algorithm (denoted MB) in addi-tion to the contrastive modification (denoted MC).We see that the contrastive modification behavesas expected and produces much higher scores forSopp, however, this method does not outperform ourLexRank algorithm.
It is interesting to note that inalmost all cases where a contrastive objective is in-troduced, the scores for the opposite viewpoint Soppincrease without decreasing the Srep scores, sug-gesting that contrastiveness can be introduced into amulti-view summarization problem without dimin-ishing the overall quality of the summary.
It isadmittedly difficult to make generalizations aboutthese methods from experiments with only one dataset, but we have at least some evidence that our al-gorithm works as intended.4.4 Unsupervised SummarizationSo far we have focused on evaluating our viewpointclustering models and our multi-view summariza-tion algorithms separately.
We will finally show howthese two stages might work in tandem in unsuper-vised summarization of the Bitterlemons corpus.Without a gold set, it is difficult to perform anextensive automatic evaluation as we did with thehealthcare data.
Instead we will perform a sim-ple qualitative evaluation to see if the algorithm ap-pears to achieve its goal.
Thus, we asked 8 peopleto guess if each viewpoint?s summary was writtenby Israeli or Palestinian authors.
To diversify thesummaries, for each annotator we randomly spliteach summary into two equal-sized subsets of thesentence set.
Thus each person was asked to labelfour different summaries, which were presented ina random order.
If humans can correctly identifythe viewpoints, then this would suggest both that theTAM accurately clustered documents by viewpointand the summarization algorithm is selecting sen-tences that coherently represent the viewpoints.We first ran TAM on our data using the same pro-cedure and parameters as in Subsection 4.2 using thefull-tuple features.
We repeated this 10 times andused the model that gave the highest data likelihoodas our model for summarization input.
We then gen-74For the Healthcare Bill Against the Healthcare Billthe government already provides half of the healthcare dollars in the government is too much involvement.united states [...] [they] might as well spend their dollars smartermy kids are uninsured.

We used ?

value on the healthcare data.Only one of these sentences was clustered incor-rectly by TAM.
The human judges correctly labeled78% of the summary sets, suggesting that our sys-tem accurately selected some sentences that couldbe recognized as belonging to the viewpoints, butis not perfect.
Unsupervised micro-level summarieswere less coherent.
Many of the sentences are mis-labeled, and the ones that are correctly labeled arenot representative of the collection.This is not surprising, and indeed exposes thechallenge inherent in our problem definition: clus-tering documents based on similarity and then high-lighting sentences with high similarity but oppositecluster membership are almost conflicting objectivesfor an unsupervised learner.
Such contrastive pairsare perhaps the most difficult data points to model.A good test of a viewpoint model may be whether itcan capture the nuanced properties of the viewpointsneeded to contrast them at the micro level.5 DiscussionThe properties of the text which we attempt to sum-marize in our work are related to the concept offraming from political science (Chong and Druck-man, 2010), which is defined as ?an interpretation orevaluation of an issue, event, or person that empha-sizes certain of its features or consequences?
focus-ing on ?certain features and implications of the issue?
rather than others.?
For example, someone in favorof the healthcare bill might focus on the benefits andsomeone against the bill might focus on the cost.However, our approach is different in that ourcontrastive objective encourages the summaries toinclude each point as addressed by all viewpoints,rather than each viewpoint selectively emphasizingonly certain points.
In a sense, this makes our sum-mary more like a live debate, where one side mustdirectly respond to a point raised by the other side.For example, someone in favor of healthcare reformmight cite the high cost of the current system, butsomeone against this might counter-argue that theproposed system in the new bill has its own highcosts (as seen in the last row of Table 4).
The idea isto show how both sides address the same issues.Thus, we can say that we are summarizing thekey arguments/issues/points from different opinions.Futhermore, our models and algorithms are definedvery generally, and while we tested their viability inthe domain of political opinion, they may also beuseful for many other comparative tasks.In conclusion, we have presented steps toward atwo-stage system that can automatically extract andsummarize viewpoints in opinionated text.
First, wehave shown that accuracy of clustering documentsby viewpoint can be enhanced by using simple butrich dependency features.
This can be done withinthe framework of existing probabilistic topic modelswithout altering the models simply by using a ?bagof features?
representation of documents.Second, we have introduced ComparativeLexRank, an extension of the LexRank algorithmthat aims to generate contrastive summaries both atthe macro and micro level.
The algorithm presentedis general enough that it can be applied to anynumber of viewpoints, and can accomodate inputwhere the viewpoints are either given fixed labels,or given probabilistic assignments.
The tradeoffbetween contrast and representation can flexibly betuned to an application?s needs.75ReferencesDavid M. Blei, Andrew Y. Ng, and Michael I. Jordan.2003.
