Towards  a proper  t reatment  o f  coerc ion  phenomena *Dani~le GodardCNRS, Universit6 Paris 7, UFRLcase 7003, 2 Place Jussieu75005 Paris Francegodard@parisT.jussieu.frJacques JayezEHESS-CEL ITH54 Boulevard Raspai l75006 Paris Francejayez~divsun.un ige .chAbstractThe interpretation of coercion construc-tions (to begin a book) has been recentlyconsidered as resulting from the operationof type changing.
For instance, a phrase oftype o (object) is coerced to a phrase of typee (event) under the influence of the predi-cate.
We show that this procedure ncoun-ters empirical difficulties.
Focussing on thebegin/commencer ase, we show that the co-ercion interpretation results both from gen-eral semantic processes and properties ofthe predicate, and we argue that it is bestrepresented at the lexical level.
The solu-tion is formulated in the HPSG formalism,where the lexical description of heads in-cludes a specification of the argument andarticulates yntax and semantics.
We pro-pose that the properties attached to thecomplement remain the same as they areoustside the construction, but that the se-mantics of the predicate is enriched to in-clude an abstract predicate of which thecomplement is an argument.1 IntroductionPredicates require that their arguments be of a giventype.
However, as is well-known, certain acceptableconstructions exhibit a mismatch between the typeof the argument, as constructed from a possible para-phrase, and the type that the argument has outside*We are indebted to Anne Abeilld, Nicolas Asher,Michel Aurnague, Andrde Borillo, Annie Delaveau, JeanMarie Marandin, Jean-Pierre Mantel, Alex Lascarides,Patrick Saint-Dizier, Annie Zaenen and our referees forhelpful comments, criticisms and suggestions.the construction.
This traditionM problem has beenrecently rephrased within type theory, where types(like e for events, p for material objects, ~?
for kinds,etc.)
classify the domain of entities (cf.
\[Bach, 1986;Carlson, 1977; Chierchia, 1984\]).
Pustejovsky pro-poses in particular that the mismatch is solved by theoperation of "type coercion" (cf.\[Pustejovsky, 1991;Pustejovsky and Anick, 1988; Boguraev and Puste-jovsky, 1991\]).
In essence, it confers to the predicatethe ability to change the argument ype.
For ex-ample, the sequence in (1) is accounted for in thefollowing way:(1) John began the book.The predicate associated with begin requires that theargument corresponding to the complement be anevent (type e).
Since the type associated with bookis different (we will suppose it is "material object",p) it is coerced to e. Accordingly, (1) is given anevent reading, which, in this case, is associated withtwo possible interpretations: "John began to readthe book", and "John began to write the book".This is an interesting way of looking at the phe-nomenon, and typing certainly plays a crucial rolein building a coercion interpretation.
However, thehypothesis of type coercion itself is not supportedby linguistic evidence, and is not sufficiently con-strained to account for the impossibility of some com-binations.
Instead of type change on the argument,we propose an enrichment of the semantics of thepredicates which give rise to coercion interpretation.Predicates may be finitely polymorphic; for instance,begin combines with arguments of type p as well asof type e. The correct interpretation is obtained atthe interpretive l vel, where it results both from gen-eral processes and specific semantic properties of thepredicate.
When begin has a complement of type168It, the interpretation makes use of a morphism be-tween events and objects (\[Krifka, 1992\]); this mor-phism itself is not noted in the grammar, but theresult of its being resorted to can be noted, as wellas the semantic properties of the item commencer.Thus, the phenomenon will be correctly expressed atthe lexical level.
More precisely, we will use lexicalrules in the HPSG format (\[Pollard and Sag, 1987;Pollard and Sag, 1993\]).
We illustrate the phe-nomenon in French and focus on the commencer (be-gin) example, which is a very clear case of a pred-icate allowing coercion interpretations.
We provideglosses, NOT English translations.2 Linguistic evidence2.1 Preservat ion  of  the  or iginal  typeAnaphora, relativization, and coordination are threephenomena which involve identity of type.
If thecoerced complement had acquired a new type, wewould expect it to behave like a phrase with thisnew type.
But it does not: le livre (the book) incommencer ie iivre (to begin the book) has proper-ties of phrases of type It, not of type e (the type ofentities with temporal constitution).That the antecedent and the anaphoric NP must be-long to the same type (\[Milner, 1982\]) is exemplifiedbelow: an NP of type "individual" may not have atype n (the type of kinds) as its antecedent.
(2) Le cheval est herbivore.
11 a quatre pattesThe horse is herbivorous.
It has four legs(3) Je ne connais pas ce cheval.
II a d~ s'gchapperd'un barns.I do not know this horse.
It must have escaped from astud farm.
(4) * Le cheval est herbivore.
11 a dTi s'gchapper d'unharas.The horse is herbivorous.
It must have escaped from astud farm.Quitter (to leave) takes a complement of type It, note: quitter la table vs *quitter sa lecture (to leave thetable, one's reading).
Yet, the clitic complement ofquitter in (5) can have le livre, the coerced comple-ment of commencer, as its antecedent.
(5) Jean a commencd son livre ~ 10 heures et ne l'apas quittg de la nuit.John began his book at ten and did not leave it all night.Conversely, the complement of arr~ter is of type e,not p: arr~ter de life, arr~ter sa lecture vs *arr~terun livre (to stop reading, one's reading, a book).
Itusually takes a null complement anaphora, which canrefer to an event complement; it cannot refer to ielivre as complement of commencer.
(6) Jean a commencd sa lecture it 10 heures et n'apas arr~t~ de la nnit.John started his reading at ten and did not stop all night.
(7) q.
q."
Jean a commencd son livre ~ 10 heures et n'apas arr~tg de la nuit.Similarly, the antecedent of a relative clause andthe relativized NP may not belong to different ypes(\[Godard, 1992\]).
(8) ~ Le cheval, qui a da s'gchapper d'un haras, estherbivoreThe horse, which must have escaped from a stud farm,is herbivorousIn this structure also, ie livre, complement of com-mencer etains its type It and does not acquire typee .
(9) Jean a commencg la lecture de ce livre, qui dur-era deux heuresJohn has begun the reading of this book, which will taketwo hours(10) Jean a commencd un iivre qui est dnormeJohn has begun a book which is huge(11) * Jean a commencd un iivre qui durera deuxhenresJohn has begun a book which will last two hoursFinally, it is well-known that conjoined categoriesare of the same type: the violation of this require-ment can give rise to the rhetorical zeugma (dit- i l  enlui-m~me et en anglais, he said, speaking to himselfand in English).
Conjunction of a coerced comple-ment with an NP which has the type expected fromthe predicate is certainly very strange, if the speakerdoes not want to produce some stylistic effect.
(12) ??
L'dtd dernier j 'a i  commencd mon dernierroman et la r~novation de la maison.Last summer I began my last novel and the refurbishingof the houseConversely, the complement of manger (to eat) is oftype It; yet, manger can share its complement withcommencer.
(13) Jean a commencd et f inalement mangg lesaumonJohn has begun, and finally eaten the salmon2.2 Asymmetry  between subjects  andobjectsIf coercion means type change operated by a predi-cate on its arguments, it is difficult to see why it doesnot apply to subjects in the same way as it does tocomplements, with identical or closely related pred-icates.
Commencer, as an intransitive verb relatedto transitive commencer, combines with subjects oftype e; thus, we would expect it to combine with co-erced subjects having a different original type, butthis is not the case.
(14) La confgrence a commencd ?t I0 heures.The lecture began at ten(15) ~ Le livre a commencg la semaine derni~re.The book began last weekAs examples of predicates which coerce their subjectarguments, \[Pustejovsky, 1991\] offers psychological169predicates uch as frighten, upset, please, etc.
Butin fact there is little evidence of coercion sentencessuch as (16).
(16) Mary bores meThis class of verbs seems rather not to constrain thetypes of the subject: even if paraphrases are taken tobe correct indications as to type, they cannot be usedto show that the subject of bores in (16) is coerced toan event, since we have a series of acceptable para-phrases for the subject like "her face, her chatter",as well as "listening to her, that she stays here", etc.Confirmation that psychological predicates are poly-morphic as regards their cause argument is given bythe following coordination (cf.
\[Copestake and Bri-scoe, 1991\]):(17) John ate and enjoyed the salmonIf eat selects a p complement and enjoy coerces a/~complement to an e, then it is difficult to see howthey can share the same complement.
The prob-lem disappears if enjoy is dimorphic, and the type ofsalmon is p.2.3 In terpreta t ion  is not  type  changingThe interpretive process which fills in information isuch cases as commencer le livre does not ENTAIL atype change.
This is shown by well-known examplesinvoked by proponents of coercion, such as a longbook.
While we agree that one reading for this NPis "a book which it takes a long time to read" (see\[Briscoe t al., 1990\]), it is clear that it is not associ-ated with a phrase coerced to an event.
Achcter doesnot allow a complement of type e, while combiningeasily with the above NP.
(18) * Jean a achetd une sdance de cindma.John bought a movie performance(19) Jean a achetd un long romanJohn bought a long novelIn the same way, the fact that the salmon in (17) is oftype p does not prevent he construction of the inter-pretation "John ate the salmon and enjoyed eatingit".
Thus, one must find an account of the interpre-tive phenomenon illustrated in (1) which does notappeal to type change.3 Properties of the phenomenonThere are three main properties which point towardsthe desirability of a lexical treatment.
(i) The phe-nomenon is lexically driven rather than a generalprocess; (it) for each lexical item, it is possible to ex-press general constraints on interpretation; (iii) theproperties of the coerced complement which play acrucial role in the acceptability of the constructionor on its range of interpretation are selected by thepredicate.
The complement of commencer must be(i) "bounded" and (it) intentionally controlled.3.1 Coerc ion is lexical ly dr ivenThe notion of coercion owes much of its attractive-ness to its potential generality: having a separategeneral set of rules able to generate a set of accept-able interpretations would significantly alleviate thetask of storing and handling semantic information.This program, at least in this strong form, encoun-ters empirical difficulties.
For instance, it is not thecase that the class of aspectual verbs which subcate-gorize for an NP of type e behaves uniformly.
Com-mencer, flair, se mettre h allow for coercion, but notcesser or arr~ter.
(20) Jean a arr~td sa lecture/* son livreJohn stopped his reading/his bookSimilarly, the temporal prepositions avant, aprds,depnis may coerce their complement, but not pen-dant.
(21) Apr~s trois martinis, Jean se sentait bienAfter three martinis John was feeling well(22) * Pendant son martini, Jean a aperfu MarieDuring his martini John saw MaryAs we have seen, the adjective long in a long novelmay be interpreted as modifying a reading event, butthe adjective intermittent does not apply to novel.
(23) Jean a commencd nn livre long/* nn livre in-termittent.John has begun a long/intermittent book3.2 Lexical information and paraphraseA VP like commencer la salle de bains (to begin thebathroom) can be understood as meaning, for exam-ple, "to begin to build/to paint/to refurbish/to cleanthe bathroom".
However, this does not imply thatsuch paraphrases should be present in the descrip-tion of the V or the VP.
It is clear that the eventsdenoted by these paraphrases share a feature: theyare all events of modification of the p complement, ofwhich they constitute a specification; it is this com-mon interpretation which is part of the semantic on-tent of the lexical item commencer.
Thus, the rele-vant distinction here is between abstract constraints,which are part of the semantic ontent, and para-phrases which exploit these constraints by checkingtheir consistency with additional information.
Anabstract constraint for commencer, when it combineswith an argument of type/~, is that the reconstructedevent should be some kind of modification.The question whether the additional information,from which the more specific paraphrase is con-structed in a given linguistic and situational environ-ment, is purely lexical, depends on world knowledge,or has some intermediate status, is philosophicallyand computationally important, but is not relevantto the coercion problem.
One could perfectly usethe qualia structure proposed by eustejovsky (\[1991\])and consider accordingly that bathroom is equippedwith a set of roles such as constitutive or formal roles,170which help to retrieve such verbs as paint, for in-stance, as far as they are consistent with the generalconstraint.3.3 Const ra in ts  on  the  NP  complement  ofcommencer3.3.1 BoundednessThe very possibility of a coercion construction de-pends on the compatibility between semantic prop-erties of the predicate and of the complement.
Look-ing more precisely at the case of commencer, we ob-serve the following requirements on the complement:the complement must refer to a "bounded" entityas opposed to an "amorphous" one.
The data arethe following.
The complement of commencer is ei-ther an infinitival VP or an NP denoting an event oran object.
In the latter case, partitives (with massnouns) or indefinite plurals (with count nouns) arenot allowed 1.
Although it appears that NPs whichdenote an event function in the same way as NPswhich denote objects, we will leave the event caseaside because of its complexity.
(24) Jean a commenc( le fromage/*du fromageJohn has begun the cheese/(of the) cheese(25) Jean a commenc~ un livre/?
?des livres cet ~t~John has begun a book/(of the) books this summerTo account for (24)-(25), we propose that the par-titive complement has the property of being amor-phous, while the complement of commencer must bebounded.
We define this predicate using Krifka'sapproach (\[Krifka, 1992\]) to the aspectual predicatetelic/atelic, whose relevance to linguistic phenomenahas been stressed by Vendler (\[Vendler, 1967\]).
In-tuitively, the idea is the following.
All events havea terminal point, but telic events (as well as objectsdenoted by count constructions) have a set termi-nal point, while atelic events (and objects denotedby mass constructions) lack a set terminal point.To this distinction, we add a new distinction be-tween bounded entities, which have a terminal point,and amorphous entities, which do not.
Krifka de-fines telic/atelic as a predicate of predicates; the lat-ter have objects as well as events in their domains,and, linguistically, they are nominal as well as ver-bal predicates.
In the same way we define amor-phous/bounded as a predicate of predicates whosedomain comprises events as well as objects.
But wewill not assume that nominal and verbal predicatesbehave in a totally parallel fashion.Let us first summarize Krifka's model and his defini-tion ofatelicity or strict cumnlativity (str.
cum. )
andtelicity or quantization (qua).
Let P be a predicatedefined on X, a complete join semi-lattice withouta bottom element, where X can be the domain ofevents (E), or objects O.
The po C of the lattice isviewed as a "part-of" relation.
P is cumulative (wrt1Further investigation is necessary for generic NPswhich exhibit restrictionsX) iff P holds for z t_l y whenever P holds for x andy in X.
A predicate is singular on X iff it holds forexactly one element of X.
A predicate is str.
cum.when it is cumulative and not singular.
A predicateis qua.
iff, when it applies to z E X, it does not ap-ply to any proper part of z.
Let T be the domain oftimes, and r an homomorphism E ~ T preservingII.
The notion of terminal point of an event (TP)  isdefined by:Ve, t(TP(e) = t ?~ (t E TAt  E r(e)AVt'(t' C r(e)t' < t))).A predicate has a set terminal point iff, for any evente to which it applies, any subevent of e to which itapplies has the same terminal point as e. Note thatall events have a terminal point (given by r), but onlya subclass of predicates, telic or qua.
predicates, im-pose a set terminal point to the events they denote.Str.
cum.
predicates which apply to at least two dif-ferent events with different erminal points have noset terminal point.
On the other hand, qua.
predi-cates have a set terminal point.
Assuming that ver-bal predicates like eat and nominal predicates likebread are (strictly) cumulative, Krifka shows thatconstructions like to eat bread are (strictly) cumula-tive.
On the other hand, constructions such as toeat the bread, which use the qua.
nominal predicatethe.bread, are demonstrably quantized.
Such an ap-proach accounts for well-known contrasts like to eatbread for ten minutes/* in ten minutes vs to eat thebread * for ten minutes/in ten minutes.
Althoughstr.
cure.
characterizes French partitives and indef-inite plurals, it appears that another distinction isneeded when one takes the full range of the comple-ments of commencer into account.
Such NPs corre-spond to str.
cum.
predicates, ince when they applyto two objects or groups of objects they apply totheir join.
Thus predicates uch as manger du pain,gcrire des livres are str.
cum.,  while manger le painand ~crire un livre are qua..
The contrast observedin English translates directly into French (eft \[Bo-rillo, 1989\]): manger du pain pendant dix minutes/*en dix minutes, gcrire des livres pendant plusieursannges/* en plusieurs annges vs manger le pain *pendant dix minutes/ca diz minutes, gcrire un livre??
pendant une semaine2/en une semaine.Nevertheless, it would be wrong to use Krifka's dis-tinction to account for (24)-(25): commencer takesVP complements which can be either str.
cum.
orqua.
(26) Jean a commenc~ manger du pain/le painThus, there is nothing in the meaning of commencerwhich prevents its combining with str.
cum.
comple-ments.
We introduce an aspectual predicate labelled"amorphous" (vs bounded).
Amorphous entails str.cure.
; bounded predicates may be either str.
cum.or qua.2We exclude here the partitive interpretation "to writesome part of a book".171AMORPHOUS I BOUNDED \]STRICT.
CUM.
I QUANTIZEDIntuitively, an event or an object are amorphouswhen they have no temporal or spatial bounds, andin particular no initial or terminal point.
Althoughamorphousness applies to both events and objects,we need two different definitions.
The intrinsic or-dering relation (E or "part-of") on the event domainE is one-dimensional, so that the mapping to thetemporal linear order is straightforward.
For objects(most notably spatial objects) we must allow for anindefinite number of dimensions.Bounded events do not satisfy AMORPHOUS andbelong to the domain of the function TP .
The con-straint for events is as follows:AMORPHOUS(P)  =ez Ve(P(e) =v -~Bt(t U_ r(e) A((Vt'(t' E ~(e) ~ t < t')) v ((Vt'(t' E r(e) ~ t' __.t)))))For a single object z, there are usually several waysof "moving through" x, along different paths.
For agiven path p the proper parts of x can be mutuallylocalized wrt a linear order <p.
This gives us a newconstraint for AMORPHOUS when P is applied toobjects:AMORPHOUS(P)  =~ Vx(P(x)  =?, -~3z',p(x' EA E ?
x" % E ?x' _%Linguistically, the predicate AMORPHOUS is as-sociated with partitive and indefinite plural deter-miners.
It is interesting to note that such NPs havea characteristic property: they may not occur as thesubjects of predication s(27) * Du pain est toujours boa h manger(Of the) bread is always good to eat(28) ??
Des livres sont toujours utiles(Of the) books are always useful(29) ??
Do pain m'a rdconfortd(Of the) bread cheered me up(30) ??
Des livres m'ont beaucoup aidd(Of the) books were of great help to meIf there is no equivalent operator on verbal predi-cates, it follows that they cannot be amorphous.
Ifadditional evidence confirms this line of reasoning, itsuggests that, in spite of strong aspectual similaritiesbetween verbal and nominal predicates (e.g.
\[Bach,1986; Krifka, 1992\])i some important distinction(s)must be made.It is easy to see now why the meaning of commencerrequires that the complement be bounded.
As a func-tion on events, commencer returns the initial part ofits argument (or is undefined): we will associate tocommencer the function f irst_part_of = ~e( I P(e) ),I P  being the initial point of the event e. As a func-tion on objects 4, f irst_part_of returns the initial3see \[Galmiche, 1986\] on the role of contextual factors.4 For simplicity, we will ignore here the "non coercive"use of commencer as "be the first part of", to which wereturn in the last section.part of any event which is associated with the ob-ject by the interpretive procedure described in sec-tion 4.
This procedure xploits the fact that thereis a morphism between parts of objects and partsof time, as noted in \[Krifka, 1992\].
It requires thatthe beginning of the event correspond to the "ini-tial" part with respect to some order, usually spa-tial.
Since amorphous objects have no initial partthe procedure fails, even if a plausible vent has beenfound (e.g.
manger for commencer dn fromage).
Foreach object x, we must have an event e and a pathp in x such that the models (O~, <p) and (Te, <),where O~ and Te are the restrictions of O and T tox and e, are isomorphic.
Then (by basic model the-ory) they are elementarily equivalent, and e satisfiesAMORPHOUS,  which means that e has not initialpoint and that f irst_part_of is undefined for e. Itfollows that commencer cannot apply to amorphouspredicates, which lack any initial part.3.3.2 I n tent iona l  contro lThe second constraint on the complement of com-mencer in its coercion use is interpretive: the recon-structed event is an event in which the object de-noted by the NP is controlled by the entity denotedby the subject of commencer.
This results from twofactors: (i) the subject of commencer retains the in-terpretation which it has when the complement is anNP of type e, and (ii) there is nothing to constructthe event from, except he NP of type o itself.The controller of an event is the entity which triggersand causally maintains it (for a general analysis ofcontrol, causality and related notions see \[Brennen-stuhl, 1982; Croft, 1991\]).
When the complementNP denotes an event, the subject is an intentionalcontroller of the event, as the following observationsindicate.
First, this NP must denote an event, thatis, an entity which allows for a controller: nomi-nals denoting psychological states and properties areexcluded 5(31) * Ace  moment Jean a commencd an grandmdpris pour les politicienAt that moment John began a great contempt for politi-cians(32) * Jean a commencd une honn~tetd remarqnableJohn has begun a remarkable honestySecond, it is not enough that the subject denote theinitiator of the event, who simply triggers it, or theinanimate cause.
It must be a full-fledged inten-tional controller.
Thus (33) is not acceptable, sincethe referee signals the beginning of a match, even hasthe power to stop it, but does not control its devel-opment5There is a restricted ass of complements, denotingcommon diseases as in commencer une grippe, un rhume,with which the subject is not interpreted as a controller.This seems to be a marginal use which we leave asidehere.172(33) ??
L'arbitre a commencg le match a 14 heuresThe referee began the match at 14 h(34) Les gquipes oat commencg le match fi 14 heures.The teams began the match at 14 hSimilarly, (35) isodd, although the acid is consideredas the cause of the event.
(35) * L 'acide a commencg la destruction du marbreThe acid has begun the destruction of the marbleFurthermore, it is not enough that the subject bethe controller of some process related with the mainevent.
For instance, commencer la conf#rence (to be-gin the lecture) may not be understood as "to beginto listen to the lecture", it means "to begin to de-liver the lecture": listening to a lecture is an activity,of which the agent may be said to be the controller,but it does not causally impinge on the process oflecturing itself.
It should be noted that these re-strictions do NOT characterize commencer when ittakes a verbal complement.
The subject does nothave to be an intentional controller, and may evenbe non-referential s in l'acide a commencg it atta-quer (corrode) le marbre or il a commencg it pleuvoir(it began to rain).Turning now to the coercion interpretation, we seethat it is necessary, but not sufficient, to say thatthe subject is interpreted as the controller of someevent in which the object is involved.
For instance,the two following interpretations are excluded:(i) the interpretation i  which the object undergoes achange of position under the action of the controller:commencer la pierre, la voiture (the stone, car) maynot mean "to begin to move the stone, to drive theear".
Yet, moving an object and driving a car arecausal processes, causally controlled by human be-ings.
(it) The interpretation i which the subject changesits position along a path denoted by the complement;in Dowty's terms (\[Dowty, 1991\]), the  complementcannot be an "incremental path": commencer ie tun-nel, le dgsert de Gobi (the tunnel, the desert of Gobi)do not mean "to begin to go through the tunnel, thedesert of Gobi".Thus, it would be a mistake to simply state thatthe reconstructed event is any event associated withthe object (as in the qualia structure for instance),even adding the condition that the subject of com-mencer must be a controller.
The complement doesnot get a default interpretation either.
In this easeone would expect the patient interpretation, giventhat the subject is a controller, which is a strongform of agentivity.
But the interpretations in (i) and(it) are instances of what Dowty calls the "proto-patient" interpretation.The requirement is stronger: not only must the sub-ject be a controller of the event, it must control theobject itself.
Driving a ear, rolling a stone, goingthrough a tunnel, or crossing a desert do not af-fect the object in any significant way.
In fact thisrequirement follows directly from the semantics ofcommencer and the only information which is avail-able, that is, the type of the object.
The subject maybe a controller in an event thoroughly constructedfrom an NP of type o only if it controls the object.When this obtains, the event is in most cases a mod-ification of the object.
The object comes into be-ing (commencer une maison = "to begin to build ahouse"), is consumed (commencer le v in= "to beginto drink the wine"), or undergoes a definite changeof state (commencer la salle de bains = "to beginto paint/clean the bathroom").
In other words, weaccept hat the information associated With the lex-ical items in the qualia structure helps to specifythe interpretation i a given context, as mentionnedabove, but it does not contribute to the semantics ofthe construction itself.
The only information whichcontributes to the semantics is borne by the lexicaliten commencer: (i) commencer is a "function" whichapplies to an event and returns its initial part, (it)the subject of commencer with an NP complement isthe controller of the event, (iii) the event is denotedby the complement e or constructed by isomorphismfrom the complement o.
However, there is a classof objects which seem to raise difficulties.
We haveconsidered material objects; there are also objectswhich me may call informational, and which occuras complements of commencer.
At first sight, theirinterpretation does not involve a modification.
Suchare a book, a list, a story, a student's paper, a mag-azine, a listing, etc.
Consider (1) again.
As noted in\[Pustejovsky, 1991\] commencer le livre/to begin thebook does not only mean "to begin to write the book"but also "to begin to read the book", an activitywhich is not immediately seen as an event of modifi-cation of the book.
This example contrasts with com-mencer une symphonic/to begin a symphony whichmay mean "to begin to compose/perform a sym-phony", not to "to begin to listen to a symphony".The problem is the following: why does the book al-low the interpretation "to read" while the symphonydoes not allow the interpretation "to listen"?
Wepropose that in fact "to read a book" is a modifica-tion of the book while "to listen to a symphony" is"not a modification of the symphony: there is no par-allelism between reading and listening.
Reading is aprocess by which the reader interprets an organizedsequence of signs, thus adding to the material objecta new informational layer.
This layer does not existindependently of the reading operation, which is to-tally controlled by the reader.
On the other hand,listening does not modify the music: nmsical soundsare not signs, they are stimuli, i.e.
they provoke re-actions but are not systematically associated withinformation according to some definite set of rules(at least in our culture).
The difference between ma-terial modification and informational modification isthat in the first case the result is objectivized, whileit is internal in the latter.1734 Lex ica l  descr ip t ionsOur treatment is twofold.
On one hand, we proposelexical descriptions in accordance with the precedinganalysis, which do not use type change and containan abstract pattern, allowing for coercion interpre-tation.
On the other hand, we must make sure thatour approach meets basic requirements of computa-tional tasks.
Coercion phenomena can raise prob-lems for understanding or generation systems, sincethey need to interpolate predicates to issue correctinterpretations or syntactic forms (\[Gerstl, 1992\]).An understanding system should be able to interpreta sentence like Jean prit ses pinceauz et commenfala porte (John took his paint-brushes and began thedoor) as "John took his brushes and began to paintthe door".
Similarly, a generation system should beable to contract commencer ~ life le livre into com-mencer le livre.We will briefly address here the problem of match-ing potential paraphrases with a phrase of form com-mencer + NP.
For instance, a sound system shouldaccept o match commencer la porte and commencerpeindre la porte (to paint the door), while it shouldforbid the pairing of commencer le t~l@hone withcommencer ~ ntiliser le t~l@hone (to begin to usethe telephone).
Our pairing system will use the typeconstraints present in the descriptions of the lexicalitems which allow for coercion interpretation, andsupposes that the candidate verbs are already there.A more ambitious system would start from a phrasecommencer + NP and retrieve all the candidate verbs(e.g.
the candidate phrase peindre from the phrasecommencer la porte).4.1 The lexical descript ion of  commencerUsing HPSG-style feature structures, we propose thetwo following descriptions of commencer with a nom-inal complement:CATSUBJCOMPCONTCATSUBJCOMPCONTcommencer1NPNPOUTP Ie(z))~)ARG \ [~ T 0.RELN' T ~rARG2 ARG 1 ' 0.1ARG 2 ' 0"2commencer2v>NPREL I INPOUTPARG I \ [~  T ~xARG2 12\[ I" 0.2The type of I P  is e --~ c A o --* o.
The function ~b is~zC{y : y = ZPCz) A y = \[~))In this structure the atomic arguments of relationsare typed (sorted).
Let EAT be an alphabet ofatomic types and E be the set of boolean or func-tional (--~) combinations ofelements of EAT; we usez T ~, where ~ E E to say that any value of z mustbe of type ~ (other notations would use xq).
We willsuppose that we have at our disposal a boolean lat-tice (E, _<) on E.As shown in section 3.3, commencer with a coercedinterpretation is the same lexical item as commencerwith a complement NP of type e. There are fourpossible patterns for a form \[NP commencer NP\],the first three of which realize the same lexical itemcommencer 1.pattern 1: Jean commence la con f6rence (lecture)pattern2: Jean commence la chambre (room)pattern3: Jean commence ie iivre (book)pattern4: Ce mot (word) commence la phrase ( sen-tence) or son num6ro (performance) commence lespectacle (show)Each pattern exhibits dependencies between thetypes of its elements.pattern h ~1 = animate, ~2 = e A bounded, ~ =executepattern 2:~1 = animate, ~2 = material A bounded,= modi fy  A intentionalpattern 3:~1 = human, el2 = in fo  A sequential Abounded, a = signprocesspattern 4:~1 = oVe, a2 = alAsequentialAbounded,= positional A part_ofThe type hierarchy is as follows (T denotes the topof the lattice):T > o, e,propertyo > material, info,  animateanimate >_ humane >_ controlcontrol >_ execute, mod i fymod i fy  >_ produce, internal_change, sign_processproperty >_ amorphous, positional, sequential,part_of, intentionalThe hierarchy obeys the constraint -,(e A o) =- .
(material A human) = - , ( info A human) = T.bounded is short for -,amorphous.Here modi fy  is intended to mean any sort of internaland durable change affecting the object (thus redec-orating and refurbishing a house are modifications,but not hanging up a picture or moving aheavy pieceof furniture).
Sequential accounts for the contrastbetween commencer un livre (book) vs *commencerun plan (map) in pattern 3 (it may mean "to beginto draw a map" not "to read a map").It should be noted that we do not equate the mean-ing of commencer with the function f irst_part_of(Ax lP(x) ) ,  which is in fact only an element of it.The notion of type change relies partly on a more di-rect association between a lexical item and a typedfunction.
Instead of changing the argument type,174we enrich the semantic structure associated with thepredicate itself.
This solution is in the same spiritas that proposed by \[Pollard and Sag, 1993\] to treata similar problem concerning the control interpreta-tion in infinitival complement sentences.Pattern 4 is an instance of commencer2.
As in thepreceding case, the meaning of commencer is a com-plex structure, but the value of ARG2 is not itselfcomplex, and the type of ARG1 subsumes the typeof ARG2.
This is necessary since the value of thefunction first_part_of is identified with the value ofARG1.4.2 The match ing  procedureThe input to the procedure is a pair (H1, H2) whereH1 is the value of ARG2 in commencerl and H2 is a\[ RELN uTa3 \]structure of form: ARG 1 u' T a4ARC2 u" T ascorresponding to the semantic part of a full lexicaldescription for a a verb.The procedure succeeds onlyif the values of RELN, ARGI',  ARG2' for HI andthose of RELN, ARG1, ARG2 for H2 unify respec-tively for some given pattern.
Consider the /-/2 forpeindre.\[ RELN peindreT(modifyAintentional) x ,humanARG2 Y T (material A bounded)In this case, since human < animate, the unifica-tion succeeds for pattern 2.
It would fail in thecase of ddplacer (move) which has a RELN slotddplacer T (control A intentional A ",modify).One cannot reasonably suppose that we have lexi-cons containing the right information at our disposal.The importance of enriching the semantic structurefor exploiting on-line information has been rightlyemphasized in \[Anick and Bergler, 1991\] and \[Puste-jovsky el al., 1992\].
Unfortunately, it seems difficultto exactly parallel the techniques decribed there, be-cause they have been devised mainly for nouns andadjectives.
Consider the entry chambre (room) in amedium size French dictionary (\[RM, 1987\]): for thecurrent meaning corresponding to bedroom, the def-inition is pidce oa l'on couche (a room where onesleeps).
The entry for ranger (to tidy) mentionsranger sa chambre as an illustration of the mean-ing mettre/remetlre d l'ordre dans un lieu (to put aplace in order).
So the verb ranger, which is a goodcandidate for matching, is available from the dictio-nary itself.
However, this is only one facet of theinformation which is necessary to control the match-ing efficiently: we need to know that ranger has thecorrect feature modify, to put it in the matchersset, and that chambre is not an info (to avoid toput coucher dans in the marchers et).
Let us sup-pose that the second problem is resolved simply "byfailure", i.e.
by failing to find any relevant connec-tion with terms which exhibit the info feature.
Thefirst problem would get a satisfying solution if wecould put mettre de l'ordre dans un lien into corre-spondence with a structure as the following:of_type (ACTION, act ionl)ACTOR(actionl, i) PATIENT(actionl, j)CONTENT (actionl, control1)of_type (CONTROL, control 1)CONTROLLER (contro11, i)CONTROLLED (controll, transit ionl)of_type (TRANSITION, trans it ion1 )STARTS (transitionl ,statel)ENDS (trans itionl, star e2)of_type (STATE, star e I ) of_type (STATE, star e2)CARRIER(statel, j) CARRIER(state2, j)This in turn would require that we link mettre del'ordre ("put .
.
.
in  order") with an action of controlover a transition from a state (of disorder) to a newone (order).
The carrier of these states would bethe relevant place (a bedroom in our example).
Itis not clear how this information could be extractedfrom standard ictionaries in this case.
Other cases,where classifiers are present in the definition, seemmore amenable to general procedures of extraction.Such difficulties are lucidly acknowledged and com-mented upon in \[Pustejovsky el al., 199.2\].
Sinceaccessing the needed feature is unrealistic in somecases, a natural question is whether we can resort toother strategies.
We note that the features combina-tions are few, which allows to list some of the verbsand nouns which exhibit them, and to check whethera given verb is an hyperonym of some member in thelist.
A temptative list for commencer is:Verbs = (consommer, ranger, construire, ddtruire,rdparer, life, interpr6ter, exdcuter, crder)Nouns = (nourriture, boisson, texte, lieu, appareil,b~timent, veuvre, matidre)Starting from a pair (commencer + NP, V) we mayobtain a first rough diagnosis by searching the Verbsand Nouns lists for NP and V, or hyperonyms ofthem, as indicated in dictionaries like \[du Chaz-aud, 1989; Delas and Demon, 1989\].
This simpletest would capture normal matchings, uch as (com-mencer le charbon (coal), braler (to burn)).
This isbecause br~ler is is an hyperonym of consommer (toconsume) in \[du Chazaud, 1989\].
If the procedure issensitive to simple preferences, it should dismiss de-viant pairs as (commencer le charbon (coal), manger(to eat)).Yet, it would not filter out abnormal candidatesas (commencer le charbon (coal), ranger (to tidy)).There is no preference violation, since it is perfectlypossible to put some heap of coal in the right place.The problems tems from the violation of the se-mantics for modification mentionned in our previ-ous analysis: moving an object does not count asan internal change.
Thus, it is necessary to capturethe relevant features at the level of pairs of elementsof Verbs and Nouns.
In this case ranger should bepaired with lieu (place).
This agrees with the factthat b~timents (buildings), which are hyponyms of175lieu can be tidied up.We propose the following pairing for the sake of il-lustration (we do not take it to be the one and truepairing):consommer nourriture, boisson, matidreranger lienconstrnire, ddtrnire appareil, lienrdparer, nettoyerlife, interpreter texteex~cuter, crier oeuvreOdd examples like commencer une symphonic, withthe "begin to listen to" interpretation, will be ex-cluded if symphonie is classified as an hyponym ofoeuvre (work).
On the other hand the interpreta-tion "begin to play" will be accepted if joner (toplay) is related to exdcuter (to perform).
Thesauriare usually better tools than synonyms dictionariesfor checking the existence of such connections.
E.g.\[Delas and Demon, 1989\] allows the following path:symphonic ::~ musiqne ~ joner.Such examples point to the desirability of exploitingexisting thesauri.
However, a good deal of restruc-turing will be necessary to exploit them in a prin-cipled way.
This is a general problem which is farbeyond the limits of this paper.4.3 Apr~sLet us briefly consider the interpretation f the nomi-nal complement of aprds (after), ignoring cases wherethis complement is simply an event (this is the stan-dard temporal case), and cases of parallelism, wherethe NP complement is understood as sharing withan NP in the S the same predicate and the same ar-gument slot wrt this predicate 6.

The predicates which are ex-cluded with commencer are equally impossible orclumsy here.
The NP is not simply understood asa proto-patient:(38) ??

(40) * Apr~s la chambre, tu travaiilerasAfter (cleaning) the room you will workIn fact, the only possible predicates point to bringingan object into existence or to making it disappear.Furthermore, the connection between the two eventsis not strictly temporal: succession is not enoughto make coercion acceptable: eventl (reconstructedfrom the NP) must be understood as the cause ofevent2 (denoted by the S):(41)??

phenomena pertainingto metaphor, metonymy, and coercion, there is noagreement on the best way to attack them.
We haveaddressed here the problem of coercion, which seemsto entail a "strong" type shift (from o to e), whilemetonymy is more properly analyzed as a codifiedfacet shift inside complex structures, and metaphor isgenerally conceived as based over analogy.
The verynature of coercion phenomena suggests that taskssuch as studying types hierarchies and methods forpositioning lexical items in these hierarchies are pre-requisites for an acceptable treatment.
It is likelythat the use of thesauri, and more generally of lex-ical descriptive tools, will prove helpful.
Our futureresearch is oriented in this direction.
We do not ex-176pect to find "rules" in a strong sense, that is, fixedprocedures that would lend themselves to a simplealgorithmic adaptation, but rather complex systemsof constraints, whose study should allow to organizethe descriptive tools in a more rigorous and princi-pled way.Re ferences\[/knick and Bergler, 1991\] P.
