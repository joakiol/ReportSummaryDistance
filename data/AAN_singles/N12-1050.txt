2012 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 456?465,Montre?al, Canada, June 3-8, 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsFine-Grained Focus for Pinpointing Positive Implicit Meaningfrom Negated StatementsEduardo Blanco and Dan MoldovanLymba CorporationRichardson, TX 75080 USA{eduardo,moldovan}@lymba.comAbstractNegated statements often carry positive im-plicit meaning.
Regardless of the seman-tic representation one adopts, pinpointing thepositive concepts within a negated statementis needed in order to encode the statement?smeaning.
In this paper, novel ideas to revealpositive implicit meaning using focus of nega-tion are presented.
The concept of granular-ity of focus is introduced and justified.
Newannotation and features to detect fine-grainedfocus are discussed and results reported.1 IntroductionSemantic representation of text is an important steptowards text understanding.
Current approaches arebased on relatively shallow representations and ig-nore pervasive linguistic phenomena such as nega-tion and metaphor.
Despite these weaknesses, shal-low representations have been proven useful for sev-eral tasks, e.g., coreference resolution (Kong et al,2009), machine translation (Wu and Fung, 2009).Consider statement (1) The company won?t shipthe new product to the United States until next year.Existing approaches to represent the meaning of (1)either indicate that the verb ship is negated or disre-gard the negation altogether.
Semantic role labelerstrained over PropBank would link n?t to ship withMNEG (i.e., negate the verb); any system based onFrameNet and more recent unsupervised proposals(Poon and Domingos, 2009; Liang et al, 2011; Titovand Klementiev, 2011) ignore negation.In order to represent the meaning of (1), one mustfirst ascertain that the negation mark n?t is actuallynegating the TEMPORAL context linked to ship andnot the verb per se; more specifically, n?t is negatingexclusively the preposition until.
Only doing so onecan aim at representing the actual meaning of (1):The company will ship the new product to the UnitedStates during next year.
Note that the verb ship, andits AGENT, THEME and LOCATION (i.e., The com-pany, the new product and to the United States) arepositive, as well as the temporal anchor next year.Regardless of the semantic representation one fa-vors (logic forms, predicate calculus, semantic re-lations, semantic frames, etc.
), we argue that pin-pointing the numerous words that contribute to im-plicit positive meanings within a negated statementis a required subtask to obtain it.
This paper aimsat extracting specific positive implicit meaning fromnegated statements.
The main contributions are:(1) interpretation of negation using fine-grained fo-cus; (2) fine-grained focus of negation annotationover a subset of PropBank; (3) feature set to de-tect fine-grained focus of negation; and (4) modelto retrieve precise positive implicit meaning fromnegated statements.2 Related WorkNegation has been widely studied from a theoreti-cal point of view.
The seminal work by Horn (1989)presents the main thoughts in philosophy and psy-chology.
Work in linguistics has studied the in-teraction of negation with quantifiers and anaphora(Hintikka, 2002), as well as the role in reasoning(Sa?nchez Valencia, 1991; Dowty, 1994): one canperform downward (but not upward) monotone in-ference with negative statements.
Zeijlstra (2007)analyzes the position and form of negative ele-456ments and negative concords; concepts such as intraand inter-domain negation and strength of negation(Ladusaw, 1996), syntactic and semantic negation(Lo?bner, 2000) have been discussed in the extensiveliterature, although we do not use them.In computational linguistics, negation has mainlydrawn attention in sentiment analysis (Wilson et al,2009; Wiegand et al, 2010) and the biomedical do-main.
Recently, two events (Morante and Sporleder,2010; Farkas et al, 2010) targeted negation mostlyon those subfields.
Among many others, Moranteand Daelemans (2009) and Li et al (2010) proposescope detectors using the BioScope corpus.
Consid-ering scope is indeed a step forward, but focus mustalso be taken into account to represent negated state-ments and detect their positive implicit meanings.Regarding corpora, BioScope annotates negationmarks and linguistic scopes exclusively on biomed-ical texts.
It does not annotate focus and it pur-posely disregards negations such as the reactionsin NK3.3 cells are not always identical (Vincze etal., 2008), which carry the kind of positive meaningwe aim at extracting (the reactions in NK3.3 cellsare sometimes identical).
Recently, Morante et al(2011) present scope annotation in two Conan Doyleworks, but they dismiss focus and positive meaningextraction.
As stated before, PropBank (Palmer etal., 2005) treats negation superficially and FrameNet(Baker et al, 1998) regrettably disregards negation.Blanco and Moldovan (2011) introduce a seman-tic representation of negation using focus detection.They target verbal negation and work on top of Prop-Bank, selecting as focus the role that correspondsto the focus of negation.
Simply put, they proposethat all roles but the one corresponding to the fo-cus are actually positive.
Their approach, however,has a major drawback: selecting the whole role oftenyields too coarse of a focus and the positive implicitmeaning is not fully specified (Section 3.1).Focus-Sensitive Phenomena.
The literature usesthe term focus for widely distinct phenomena; spacepermits only a cursory review.
Within functionalgenerative grammars, focus is defined as what is be-ing asserted about the topic (Hajic?ova?
et al, 1995).The term is also used in pragmatics (Glanzberg,2005), and in phonetics and phonology (Xu and Xu,2005; Beaver et al, 2007).In linguistics, focus is largely associated with thetheory presented in Mats Rooth?s dissertation (1985)and posterior publications (Rooth, 1992).
He ana-lyzes the effect of focus in diverse phenomena, e.g.,questions and answers, reasons and counterfactu-als, conversational implicature, bare remnant ellip-sis.
His alternative semantics (e.g., they didn?t orderthe right parts implies that some alternative of theform they ordered X is true) (Rooth, 1997) was aninspiration for this work.
However, Rooth does notdiscuss how to detect focus of negation or its granu-larity and only provides simple made-up examples.3 Scope and FocusNegation has both scope and focus and they are keyto capture its meaning.
Scope is the part of themeaning that is negated.
Focus is that part of thescope that is most prominently or explicitly negated(Huddleston and Pullum, 2002).
All elements whoseindividual falsity would make the negated statementstrictly true belong to the scope.
Focus is the ele-ment of the scope that is intended to be interpretedas false to make the overall negative true.Consider (1) We didn?t get an offer for more than$40 and its positive counterpart (2) We got an offerfor more than $40.
The truth conditions of (2) are:(a) somebody got something; (b) we got; (c) an of-fer was gotten; and (d) the offer was for more than$40.
In order for (2) to be true, (a?d) have to betrue.
Conversely, the falsity of any of them is suffi-cient to make (1) true: (1) would be true if nobodygot anything, we didn?t get, an offer wasn?t gottenor the offer wasn?t for more than $40.
Thus, all fourstatements (a?d) are inside the scope of (1).The focus is often more difficult to identify.
Textunderstanding is needed and context plays an impor-tant role.
The most probable focus for (1) is morethan, which corresponds to the interpretation we gotan offer for $40 or less.
Another possible focus isfor more than $40, which yields we got an offer, butnot for more than $40.
A third possible focus is anoffer for more than $40, which yields we got some-thing, but not an offer for more than $40.
Section3.1 discusses coarse versus fine-grained focus.Both scope and focus are primarily semantic,highly ambiguous and context-dependent.
More ex-amples can be found in Table 1 and 3, and (Huddle-ston and Pullum, 2002, Chap.
9).457No.

Usingcoarse-grained focus (wavy underline) would yield a much more generic, less preferred interpretation.3.1 Granularity of FocusIn this paper, we refer to the focus considered byBlanco and Moldovan (2011) as coarse-grained andindicate it with a wavy underline; we refer to thefocus we work with as fine-grained and indicate itwith a regular underline, e.g., We didn?t get:::an:::::offer:::for::::::::::more than::::$40.
Whereas coarse-grained focus isrestricted to include all words belonging to a verbargument (as per their definition and annotation, fo-cus is the full text of a semantic role in PropBank),fine-grained focus is not.
This allows us to narrowdown the actual negative meaning and pinpoint morepositive implicit meaning.Considering fine-grained focus is a substantialstep towards a comprehensive semantic representa-tion of negation.
Following with the example above,encoding that we got something, but not an offer formore than $40 (coarse-grained) is useful, but encod-ing we got an offer for $40 or less (fine-grained) ispreferred.
Several examples of coarse versus fine-grained focus and the benefits of using the latterover the former are provided in Table 1.
In all state-ments, using coarse-grained focus yields an interpre-tation with all words underlined with a wavy under-line negative and the rest positive, e.g., statement (8)would be interpreted as I believe in something be-cause of the high degree of public interest, but notthat in this business you can be totally laissez-faire.Selecting the elements that belong to the fine-grained focus is a difficult task.
In example (1), bothcoarse and fine-grained foci are the same and yieldthe same interpretation.
In the rest of examples andin the vast majority of negations we annotated (Sec-tion 4), fine-grained focus comprises fewer wordsand yields more specific interpretations.The coarse-grained focus in statements (1, 2) isan adverbial phrase.
In (1) coarse-grained focus isa single word and thus fine-grained focus is triviallythat word.
In statement (2), fine-grained focus al-lows us to keep the comparison between the new andold group in the interpretation.Examples (3, 4) correspond to statements whosecoarse grained focus is a prepositional phrase.
Sim-ple rules based on part-of-speech tags are not suit-able here, deep understanding of text is needed.
Thefine-grained focus in example (3) is the preposition,but that is not the case in (4).
Fine-grained focusin these statements allows us to obtain more com-plete interpretations, namely spell out the location(metaphorically speaking) were the games ended in(3) and the quantity sold in (4).Examples (5?8) correspond to statements whosecoarse-grained focus is a subordinate clause.
Notethat a verb is contained in the coarse-grained focusin these examples.
In statement (5), the fine-grainedfocus is the first word, a preposition.
However, thatis not the case in (8), where the MANNER of theverb within the subordinate clause (i.e., totally) isselected as fine-grained focus.
In (6), the phrasalverb give away is the fine-grained focus.
Statement(7) is specially interesting because it contains a dou-ble negation and fine-grained focus is the negationmark within the coarse-grained focus.Note that interpreting statements using coarse-grained focus is by no means wrong, but it is notoptimal.
The interpretation using fine-grained focusentails the one using coarse-grained focus.
For ex-ample, in (2), The new group is doing equal or worsethan the old one (fine) entails The new group is do-ing, but not any better than the old one (coarse).458Node # Negations % NegationsNP 1,051 39.93PP 570 21.65ADVP 415 15.75SBAR 323 12.30S 202 7.67ADJP 33 1.26Other 38 1.43Table 2: Syntactic nodes for coarse-grained focus.4 Annotating Fine-Grained FocusWe have annotated fine-grained focus of negation ontop of the coarse-grained focus annotated by Blancoand Moldovan (2011).
In this paper, we concen-trate on negations whose coarse-grained focus is aprepositional phrase (PP), adverbial phrase (ADVP)or subordinate clause (SBAR).
Excluding cases inwhich the verb is the coarse-grained focus, thesesyntactic nodes correspond to 49.70% of negations(Table 2).
When a verb is the coarse-grained focus,it is not advantageous to consider fine-grained focusbecause both of them are always the same.
e.g., Weurge our citizens not to:::::wait until it is too late [inter-pretation: we urge out citizens to act].
An exampleof NP being coarse-grained focus is They realizedthey didn?t order::the::::::right:::::parts.We chose PP, ADVP and SBAR over nounphrases (NP, the most common syntactic realiza-tion) because they offer a variety of lexical and syn-tactic realizations, and thus allow us to tackle thetask of fine-grained focus prediction in an assort-ment of constructions (as opposed to target exclu-sively NP).
As we shall see, ADVP are shorter andeasier, whereas PP and SBAR often contain complexsyntactic (and semantic) structures and are tougher.Annotation is done at the word level.
Each wordbelonging to the coarse grained focus is marked if italso belongs to the fine-grained focus.
This allowsus to narrow down the actual negative meaning andreveal the most positive implicit meaning.
In somecases (32%, Table 4), coarse and fine-grained fociinclude the same words (e.g., It doesn?t:::::::always hurt[interpretation: it hurts sometimes]).
However, fine-grained focus usually (68%) comprises fewer words.Annotators were first trained with examples sim-ilar to the ones in Table 1.
In a first round,they were asked to select as fine-grained focus thewords within the coarse-grained focus that they be-lieved were intended to be negated.
These instruc-tions were purposely vague to analyze disagree-ments and allow us to define detailed guidelines.Inter-annotator agreement (exact match) was 41%.This number is low, but the task is challenging anda mismatch of one token (potentially a noncontentword (the, a, etc.)
or even a punctuation mark(comma, dash, etc.)
is counted as disagreement.Conflicts were resolved and their causes analyzed.In a second round, sentences were annotated follow-ing the improved guidelines (Section 4.1).
In bothrounds, annotators were presented with plain text;they did not have access to any other information.4.1 Annotation GuidelinesWe aim at annotating fine-grained focus in order topinpoint the numerous positive concepts within anegated statement.
All concepts but the ones belong-ing to the fine-grained focus should be interpretedpositive.
Our annotation criteria is succinctly sum-marized by the following principles:1.
We annotate fine-grained focus of negation toreveal specific positive implicit meaning; we donot strictly follow any theory of focus.2.
We assume that fine-grained focus is containedwithin the coarse-grained focus.3.
Decisions are made taking into account the cur-rent sentence and context.
Context is limited tothe previous and next sentence.4.
World knowledge is taken into account.
Thus,sentences are fully interpreted to identify posi-tive implicit meaning.5.
In case of ambiguity, we prioritize:(a) fine-grained focus that yields novel mean-ing over foci yielding meaning alreadystated elsewhere;(b) narrow over wide fine-grained focus.
Thenarrower the focus, the more specific thepositive meaning revealed.
(c) the fine-grained focus that reveals themost obvious positive implicit meaning,i.e., meaning requiring the least worldknowledge and assumptions to hold.6.
If there are two options for fine-grained focusyielding semantically equivalent positive im-plicit meanings, we select the fine-grained fo-cus occurring earlier within the sentence.459No.

]Table 3: Examples of annotation (and relevant context) exemplifying the annotation guidelines.4.2 Examples of AnnotationIn this section, we exemplify our annotation guide-lines with the statements in Table 3.
When example(1) is interpreted in context [criterion 3], we obtainat most half of the students will be admitted strictlyby academic criteria.
Word knowledge [criterion 4]allows us to determine that if 40?50% of studentsare admitted a certain way, at most half of studentsattending will be admitted this way (a student admit-ted may not enroll).
Word knowledge is also used inexample (2): however strong the chain is, one couldcut it with a stronger tool than bolt cutters.Statement (3) implicitly states that it is growingfast enough for other parties.
Thus, we chooseenough [interpretation: it is growing insufficientlyfast for us] since it reveals novel positive meaning[criterion 5a].
Another option discarded is us [inter-pretation: it is growing fast enough for someone, butnot us].
Note that revealing novel positive implicitmeaning is not always possible, e.g., statement (4).There are several options for statement (5): (5a) adefendant?s failure to testify [interpretation: a prose-cutor can comment, but not on a defendant?s failureto testify]; (5b) a defendant?s [a prosecutor can com-ment on somebody?s failure to testify, but not thedefendant?s]; and (5c) testify [a prosecutor can com-ment on the defendant?s failures to do something,but not to testify].
We prefer (5c) since it reveals themost specific positive meaning [criterion 5b].
Notethat narrowing down the coarse-grained focus is notalways possible as exemplified in example (6): onecannot tell if the reason relates to another skill or tosomething else (e.g., economy, weather).In example (7), we choose the fine-grained focusthat reveals the most obvious implicit positive mean-#FGF %(CGF = FGF) #FGF/#CGFPP 5.53 1.17% 0.44ADVP 1.38 89.19% 0.94SBAR 9.79 14.79% 0.32All 5.25 32.41% 0.57Table 4: Numeric analysis: average number of wordsin fine-grained focus, percentage of negations in whichcoarse and fine-grained focus are the same and averageratio of words in fine versus coarse-grained focus.ing [criterion 5c], very much [interpretation: an eco-nomic slowdown would harm the major investmentmarkets a little].
Another option is slowdown, yield-ing the plausible but less felicitous interpretation re-sponders think that an economic recession/turmoil(but not a slowdown) would harm the major invest-ment markets very much.
A third option is major[responders think that an economic slowdown wouldharm minor investment markets very much].
Thelast two options are plausible but less likely.Finally, statement (8), there are two semanti-cally equivalent options: (8a) in [interpretation: thegames finished below the top 10] and (8b) 10 [in-terpretation: the games finished in the top X, whereX is larger than 10].
We choose the former since itoccurs earlier in the sentence [criterion 6].4.3 Annotation AnalysisThe three syntactic realizations of coarse-grained fo-cus we aim at narrowing down have significantly dif-ferent characteristics.
Table 4 summarizes some ba-sic numeric analysis.
Intuitively, ADVPs are fairlyeasy (they are short and coarse-grained and fine-grained foci are often the same).
On the other hand,PP and SBAR are longer and only 44% and 32% ofwords belonging to the coarse grained focus belongto the fine-grained focus respectively.460Baseline P R FCOARSEPP 1.96 1.89 1.92ADVP 92.86 92.86 92.86SBAR 15.38 13.33 14.29All 29.52 27.93 28.70FIRST-WORDPP 33.33 32.08 32.69ADVP 92.86 92.86 92.86SBAR 35.29 20.00 25.53All 51.04 44.14 47.34FIRST-JJPP 29.82 32.08 30.91ADVP 92.86 92.86 92.86SBAR 15.38 13.33 14.29All 52.34 42.34 42.34BASICPP 54.17 49.06 51.49ADVP 92.86 92.86 92.86SBAR 45.00 30.00 36.00All 63.54 54.95 58.94Table 5: Precision, recall and f-measure of baselines.5 Learning Fine-Grained FocusWe follow a standard supervised learning approach.Each token from each annotated negation becomesan instance.
The decision to be made is whether ornot an instance is part of the fine-grained focus.
Theannotated sentences (comprising several instances)were divided into training (70%), held-out (15%)and test (15%).
The held-out portion was used totune the feature set and results are reported for thetest split only, i.e., using unseen instances.Detecting fine-grained focus is similar to textchunking.
Text chunking consists of dividing textinto syntactically related nonoverlapping groups ofwords (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000).
Onthe other hand, we aim at dividing the words withina negated statement into belonging or not belong-ing to the fine-grained focus.
Our problem can beredefined as detecting one type of chunk indicatingthe fine grained focus (FGF).
We use the standardBIO notation, in which the first element of a chunkis prefixed by B- (beginning) and other elements ofthe chunk are preceded by I- (inside).
The label Ois used to indicate tokens outside any FGF chunk.Baselines.
We have implemented four baselines topredict fine-grained focus from the elements withinthe coarse-grained focus:?
COARSE: select all words.?
FIRST-WORD: select the first word.?
FIRST-JJ: select the first adjective; if none isfound, apply FIRST-WORD.?
BASIC: same as system in Section 5.2 but usingfeatures POS-tag, word and coarse-chunk.Table 5 shows the performance of these base-lines.
All of them obtain the same performancefor ADVPs, and BASIC yields the best results.FIRST-WORD successfully predicts fine-grained fo-cus mostly in cases in which the fine-grained focusis a preposition positioned at the beginning of thecoarse-grained focus (e.g., Table 3, statement 8).5.1 Selecting FeaturesWe use a mixture of features proposed for standardtext chunking, semantic role labeling and novel fea-tures characterizing negation (Table 6).
We onlyprovide more details for the non-obvious ones.Features 1?5 characterize the current token withan emphasis on negation.
Neg-prefix indicates ifa word is an adjective, starts with a negation prefixand the reminder of it is a valid adjective.
We con-sider the following negation prefixes: a-, an-, anti-,dis-, il-, im-, in-, ir-, non- and un- and check whetherthe reminder is a valid adjective querying WordNet.This successfully allows us to detect irrelevant (pre-fix ir-; relevant is a valid adjective) and disregard ad-jectives that just happen to start with a negated pre-fix, e.g., artistic, intelligent.
Any-prefix indicatesif a word starts with any (e.g., anytime).
Huddle-ston and Pullum (2002, p.823) refer to these wordsas ?any class of items?
and include them in thenegatively-oriented polarity-sensitive items (NPIs).Features signaling other NPIs (until, dare, yet, etc.
)did not bring an improvement on the developmentset.
Ly-suffix typically signals an adverb indicat-ing the manner in which something happened.Features 6?18 describe the coarse-grained focus.Coarse-path corresponds to four features indicat-ing paths of length 1?4 from coarse-node to thetoken.
Including the full path did not yield an im-provement on the development set.
Coarse-headis calculated following (Collins, 1999).Finally, features coarse-verb and sem-roleare useful in cases in which the token is not only partof the semantic role corresponding to the coarse-grained focus (i.e., a role of verb pred-word), butalso a role of a verb within the coarse-grained focus(i.e., a role of verb coarse-verb).
For example inTable 3, example (7), for token slowdown we haveword = slowdown, pred-word = think, coarse-role= A1, coarse-verb = harm and sem-role = A0.461No.

If a feature is especially useful for a particularsyntactic node, we indicate so between parenthesis in the right hand side of column 1 (otherwise it is useful for all).5.2 Experiments and ResultsWe have carried our experiments using Yamcha (Ku-doh and Matsumoto, 2000), a generic, customizable,and open source text chunker1 implemented usingTinySVM2.
Following Yamcha?s design, we distin-guish between static and dynamic features.
Staticfeatures are the ones depicted in Table 6 for a fixedsize window.
Dynamic features are the predictedclasses for a fixed set of previous instances.
Whereasvalues for static features are considered correct, val-ues for dynamic features are predictions of previousinstances and therefore may contain errors.
Varyingwindow size effectively varies the number of fea-tures considered, the larger the window the more lo-cal context is taken into account.Window sizes are defined using ranges betweeninstances.
The instance to be predicted has index?0?, the previous one ?
?1?, the next one ?1?, and soon.
The range [i..j] indicates we take into accountfrom the ith to the jth instances to predict the cur-rent instance.
Ranges for dynamic features can onlycontain instances preceding the current one.The best performing system was obtained using awindow including the current and two previous in-stances, and taking into account dynamic features.This system uses a total of 68 features: 66 static fea-tures (22?3 = 66, 22 features per instance, windowcontains 3 instances) and 2 dynamic features.1http://chasen.org/ taku/software/yamcha/2http://chasen.org/ taku/software/TinySVM/Window SizeP R Fstatic dynamic[-1..0]none 59.20 66.67 62.71[-1..-1] 68.27 63.96 66.05[-1..1]none 66.04 63.06 64.52[-1..-1] 70.10 61.26 65.38[0..1]none 57.85 63.06 60.34[-1..-1] 63.92 55.86 59.62[-2..0]none 60.00 62.16 61.06[-2..-1] 71.15 66.67 68.84[-2..2]none 62.96 61.26 62.10[-2..-1] 68.42 58.56 63.11[0..2]none 60.00 59.46 59.73[-2..-1] 64.21 54.95 59.22[-3..0]none 55.65 62.16 58.72[-3..-1] 68.93 63.96 66.36[-3..3]none 62.62 60.36 61.47[-3..-1] 67.01 58.56 62.50[0..3]none 57.80 56.76 57.27[-3..-1] 64.13 53.15 58.13Table 7: Results using different window sizes.Table 7 provides results on the test split for severalwindow sizes considering and not considering dy-namic features.

Win-dows not considering the i next instances yield bet-ter performance when using dynamic features (i.e.,[?i..0] is superior to [?i..i]).

Larger and discontinuous win-dows (e.g., [-4..-3, -1..-1]) did not bring an improve-ment during development and were discarded.Finally, we report detailed results for the best per-forming system in Table 8.6 Limitations and Future WorkThe work presented here effectively extracts specificpositive implicit meaning from negated statements.We depict below some limitations and shortcomingsthat could be targeted as future work.Types of negation.
We only targeted verbal,clausal and analytic negation (Huddleston and Pul-lum, 2002).
Analyzing other types (e.g., synthetic,non-verbal: I ate nothing, Nobody liked the party) isneeded for a more comprehensive approach.All positive meanings.
Not all implicit positivemeanings are always detected.
For example, If thepayment isn?t received::by::::::today, an eviction noticewill be send out [interpretation: If the payment isreceived after today, an eviction notice will be sendout].
Our proposal fails to detect that if no paymentis received, the notice will also be send.
Allowingmultiple fine-grained foci seems a valid solution.Fine-grained within coarse-grained.
In a few ex-amples, interpreting a negated statement using fine-grained focus requires modifications in other parts ofthe sentence as well.
For example, That increase inthe money supply would not have happened:::::::without:::the::::::::consent:::of:::the::::::::Federal:::::::::Reserve.
The interpreta-tion is That increase would have happened with theconsent of the Federal Reserve.
This is not wrong,but a better option is to remove the modal would inthe positive interpretation: the increase did happen(with the consent of the Federal Reserve).Overall Interpretation.
A complete semantic rep-resentation for a statement (not only the verbalnegation within) may require the same conceptwith two polarities.
Consider [::::::::::In the past]TEMPORAL,[you]AGENT just wore an unknown brand and didn?t[care]verb.
The verbal negation is correctly inter-preted now you care, but in the past remains as is(i.e., positive) for the verb wore [interpretation: inthe past you just wore an unknown brand].
Strictlyspeaking, this is not a limitation but something totake into account to obtain a semantic representationof the whole statement.
Our proposal successfullyretrieves positive implicit meaning.7 ConclusionsIn this paper, we have argued that negated statementsoften carry positive implicit meaning and that its de-tection is key in order to capture their semantics, re-gardless of the semantic representation one favors(e.g., predicate calculus, semantic relations).We have introduced the concept of granularity offocus of negation.
Going beyond previous work,considering fine-grained focus allows us to revealnarrow positive implicit meaning.
In the majorityof cases (68%, Table 4) we are able to detect morepositive implicit meaning than previous work con-sidering a coarse-grained focus.
We do not imposeany syntactic restriction on which parts of a sen-tence might belong to the fine-grained focus.
Theannotation was done selecting words without takinginto account any syntactic or semantic information.This approach effectively marks only the words thatshould be negated, but arguably makes predictionmore difficult since fine-grained focus often does notcorrespond to a single node in the syntactic tree.We have approached the task of fine-grained fo-cus detection as a chunking problem in which wepredict one chunk, FGF.
The best model obtains anf-measure of 68.84, calculated by considering exactmatches between chunks.
In other words, unless themodel predicts as fine-grained focus exactly the ac-tual fine-grained focus, it is considered wrong whencalculating performance.
We believe this is the hon-est way of evaluating performance, even though par-tial matches could be useful for an actual applica-tion.
For example, in The U.S.?s largest suppliershaven?t been filling their quotas:to::::::::the full::::::extent [in-terpretation: they have been fullfilling their quotasto a partial extent], if the model predicts full as theonly word belonging to fine-grained focus we countit wrong even though it successfully detects the mostimportant part of it, i.e., the adjective full.463ReferencesCollin F.
