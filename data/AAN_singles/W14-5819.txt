However, little attention hasbeen paid on this issue.
No Chinese corpus is available by now with all different types of sen-tences annotated with their main functionalities in terms of modality, speech act or event.
Thispaper describes a Chinese corpus with all the information annotated.
Based on the five eventtypes that are usually adopted in previous studies of event classification, namely state, activi-ty, achievement, accomplishment and semelfactive, we further provide finer-grained categories,considering that each of the finer-grained event types has different semantic entailments.
To d-ifferentiate them is useful for deep semantic processing and will thus benefit NLP applicationssuch as question answering and machine translation, etc.
We also provide experiments to showthat the different types of sentences are differentiable with a promising performance.1 IntroductionEvent classification is a fundamental task for NLP applications, such as question answering and ma-chine translation, which need deep understanding of the text.
Previous work (Siegel, 1999; Siegel andMcKeown, 2000; Palmer et al., 2007; Zarcone and Lenci, 2008; Cao et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2000)aims to classify events into four categories, namely state, activity, accomplishment and achievement, i.e.Vendler?s framework adopted from linguistic studies (Vendler, 1967; Smith, 1991).
High performancewas reported on the classification, however based on the assumption that all sentences describe an even-t, which is not case in real text.
Modalities and speech acts are not considered and no finer-grainedclassification is proposed.The aim for aspectual classification for a specific language is to build verb classes.
In such framework,viewpoint aspect in terms of perfective vs. imperfective is not considered.
For example, he is eating asandwich and he ate a sandwich are all instances of accomplishment.
However, we argue that thisframework is not enough for more accurate event processing.
It is obvious that the two sentences havedifferent meanings and different consequences.
The situation described by the first sentence is still goingon at the speech time, while the second sentence implies that the event has finished.
So, in the perspectiveof event processing, it is necessary and important to discriminate the two different aspects.Another important issue is that not all sentences describe events.
For example, Austin (1975) discrim-inated two different types of sentences: constative and performative.
Sentences that report or describeevents are in the first category.
Sentences of the performative category mainly refer to speech (illocu-tionary) acts, actions that are done by speech.
For example, by uttering the sentence I declare that thenew policy will take effect from now on, the authorized speaker brings a new policy into effect.
In thiscase, uttering the sentence itself is an event.
Discriminating speech acts are especially useful in speechcorpora, e.g.
(Avila and Mello, 2013).Modality is important due to its interaction with factuality and truth of the embedded propositions.
Forexample, he can eat two sandwiches describes a dynamic modality about the subject?s ability of eating.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Modality has been considered in modeling speaker?sopinions (Benamara et al., 2012), machine translation (Baker et al., 2012), etc.Sauri et al.
(2006; 2012) proposed a framework for modeling modalities.
However, their definition ofmodality is a little different from that used by linguists.
The main motivation of their work is to predictthe factuality of a proposition.
As a result, all factors that may affect the factuality of propositionsare regarded as modalities.
In our framework, we will adopt the definition in linguistic studies thatmodality expresses a speaker?s belief or attitude on an embedded proposition (Palmer, 2001).
Factualityis determined by many factors other than modalities.
However, we don?t want to mix all the factorstogether in linguistic perspective.In this paper, we will describe a Chinese corpus in which different sentence types are discriminated.Finer-grained event types are also incorporated with a theory proposed in (Xu and Huang, 2013).
Thedetails of the framework will be discussed in the next section.The remaining of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 introduces the theoretical framework weshall adopt for our annotation.
Section 3 describes a Chinese corpus we annotated with some statisticalinformation.
Section 4 describes a classification experiment based on the annotated corpus.
Section 5 isthe conclusion and our future work.2 The Annotation FrameworkIn this section, we will give an introduction to the theoretical framework from a linguistic perspective.There are two main levels for the classification.
Sentences are first discriminated according to their mainfunctions, e.g.
constative and performative (Austin, 1975).
Constative sentences are further divided intomodality which mainly expresses the addresser?s propositional attitude and event which is a descriptionor report of a real situation without the speaker?s attitude.
One basic assumption is that one sentence onlyhas one main function in terms of expressing speaker?s modality, speech act or describing an event.
So,there is no overlap among the three types of sentences.2.1 ModalitySentences denoting modalities are different from the sentences reporting events in that the former onlyrefers to a proposition upon which the speaker expresses his attitude its truth value, while the later is afact without incorporating speakers?
opinions but only speaker?s perception.
It is possible that speakerscan make mistakes in their perceptions.
However it is beyond the linguistic level and there is no way topredict the correctness based on the surface of the sentence.
Thus, it is another issue out of the discussionof this paper.
We adopt the modal theory by Palmer (2001).
According to him, modality could be dividedinto epistemic, deontic and dynamic.Epistemic modality expressed the speaker?s opinion on the truth of the embedded proposition in termsof necessity and possibility.
Informally, epistemic modality expresses what may be in the world.
Forexample, ta1 ken3ding4 zai4 ban4gong1shi4 ?he must be in his office?
describes an epistemic modalityof the speaker that he is sure about the truth of the embedded proposition.Deontic modality expresses what should be in the world, according to speaker?s expectations, certainrules, laws and so on.
For example, ni3 bi4xu1 zun1shou3 gui1ze2 ?You must obey the rules?.Dynamic modality describes the abilities of a subject, such as ta1 hui4 you2you3 ?he can swim?, wo3de0 ban4gong1shi4 ke3yi3 kan4jian4 da4hai3 ?you can see the ocean from my office?.Evaluation is also treated as a modality in our framework.
Evaluation describes the speaker?s opinionon a proposition.
It is different from epistemic in that it suggests rather than makes judgment on the truthof a proposition.
For example, ta1 suan4shi4 shi4jie4shang4 zui4hao3 de0 ge1shou3 le0 ?he should bethe best singer in the world?.
Evaluative sentences only refer to those that contain explicit markers, e.g.suan4shi4 ?should be?.
The sentence ta1 shi4 shi4jie4shang4 zui4hao3 de0 ge1shou3 ?he is the bestsinger in the world?
is not treated as evaluation.
In this sense, evaluative is not equivalent to subjective.158Exclamation is treated as a subset of evaluation.
Take nian2qing1 ren2 a0 !
?Young people!?
forexample, it mostly expresses an implicit evaluation, e.g.
only young people could do crazy things ofsome kind, based on which the exclamation is expressed by the speaker.2.2 Speech actFor speech act (illocutionary act), we adopt the theory by Searle (1976), where five different categoriesare proposed, namely assertive, expressive, directive, commissive and declaration.
In addition, we alsoput interrogative sentences under this category.
Speech act sentences only refer to those sentences thatare explicit utterances, e.g.
the sentences quoted in text.Assertive is to commit the speaker (in varying degrees) to something?s being the case or the truth ofthe expressed proposition.
For example, wo3 zheng4ming2 ta1 shi4 xue2sheng1 ?I certify that he is astudent?.Expressive expresses the psychological state specified in the sincerity condition about a state of af-fairs specified in the propositional content.
Verbs for expressive speech act includes xie4xie4 ?thank?,bao4qian4 ?apologize?, huan1ying2 ?welcome?, dui4bu4qi3 ?sorry?
etc.
For example, xie4xie4bang1mang2 ?Thanks for your help?.Directive is usually a command or requirement of the speaker to get the hearer to do something.
Forexample, ni3 guo4lai2 yi1xia4 ?Come here please?.Commissive is to commit the speaker (in varying degrees) to some future course of action.
For exam-ple, wo3 hui4 bang1 ni3 ?I shall help you?.Declaration is to bring about the correspondence between the propositional content and reality.
Suc-cessful performance guarantees that the propositional content corresponds to the world.
For example,wo3 xuan1bu4 ben3 ci4 hui4yi4 zheng4shi4 kai1mu4 ?The conference now start?.Interrogative is an illocutionary act of the speaker that requires the hearer to provided some infor-mation.
For example, ni3 jiao4 shen2me0 ming2zi4 ?
?What?s your name??
and ni3 qu4 ting1 na4 ge4jiang3zuo4 ma0 ?
?Will you attend the speech??
Interrogative sentences are usually with a question mark???.
However, not all sentences with question mark are interrogative.
For example, rhetorical questionsusually don?t need the answer from the hearer.
Instead, it actually expresses the speaker?s evaluation ona situation.
For example, the sentence wo3 zen3me0 ke3yi3 bu4 jin4xin1 zhao4gu4 ?
?How could I nottake care of him carefully??
should be labelled as evaluative modality rather than interrogative speechact.2.3 EventsHere, we describe a new framework by incorporating finer-grained event categories as described in (X-u and Huang, 2013).
Each of the finer-grained categories corresponds to only one of the five coarsecategories.
So, it is an extension of and is compatible with the Vendler?s framework.2.3.1 Primitive EventsAccording to Xu and Huang (2013), there are three event primitives, namely static state (S), dynamic state(D), and change of state.
Static state is equivalent to the previous notion state, which is a homogeneousprocess, where all subparts are of the same kind of event.
Dynamic state refers to an ongoing dynamicprocess, e.g.
running, eating etc., that is perceived like a state.
Change of state is then defined as a changefrom one state, either static or dynamic, to another state.Change of state actually refers to the previous notion achievement.
Theoretically, there are four type-s of changes: static-static change (SS), static-dynamic change (SD), dynamic-static change (DS) anddynamic-dynamic change (DD).
In detail, SD change is somewhat equivalent to inceptive achievement,and DS change is somewhat equivalent to terminative or completive achievement.159Event Type Representation ExampleStatic State ?- ta1 hen3 gao1 he is tallDynamic State ????
ta1 zai4 pao3bu4 he is runningSS Change ?|?
ta1 bing4 le0 he got illSD Change ?|???
ta1 kai1shi3 pao3bu4 le0 he started runningDS Change ???|?
ta1 ting2zhi3 pao3bu4 le0 he stopped runningDD Change ???|???
dian4nao3 qi3dong4 hao3 le0 the computer finished startupTable 1: Primitives of Events.Table 1 shows the extended event primitives with some illustrative examples.
We use ???
and ?????
todenote static state and dynamic state respectively.
?|?
is used to denote a temporal boundary.
In case ofchange of state, the temporal boundary overlap with the logical boundary, i.e.
the change.Negations usually denote static state.
In Chinese, there are two negation adverbs, bu4 ?not?
andmei2you3 ?not?.
However, they are different in that the former negates a generic event meaning thatsuch event doesn?t happen, while the latter negates the existence of an event instance.
For example, ta1bu4 he1jiu3 ?he doesn?t drink?
describes an attribute of the subject, which is intrinsically a static state.ta1 mei2you3 he1jiu3 ?he didn?t drink?
describes a fact that there is no event instance of his drinking,which is also a static state.
Negation of a modality is still a modality.
For example, ta1 bu4 ke3neng2zai4 ban4gong1shi4 ?he cannot be in his office?
still describes an epistemic modality.2.3.2 Complex EventsBased on the primitives, we can compose complex events.
Delimitative describes a temporal boundedstatic state that has a potential starting point and ending point, within which the static state holds, e.g.
ta1bing4 le0 yi1 ge4 xing1qi1 ?he was ill for one week?.
Process describes a temporal bounded dynamicstate that has a potential starting point and ending point, within which the dynamic state holds, e.g.ta1 pao3 le0 yi1 ge4 xiao3shi2 ?he ran for one hour?.
Semelfactive is different from Process in that itsdurations is quite short and is usually perceived as instantaneous.
In other words, the temporal boundariesof semelfactive is usually naturally determined.
For example, ta1 qiao1 le0 yi1 xia4 men2 ?he knockedthe door once?.
There is no way to length the duration of the knocking action.
However, a series ofiterative semelfactives could form dynamic process.
For example, ta1 qiao1 le0 yi1 ge4 xiao3shi2 de0men2 ?he knocked the door for an hour?
gives a reading of iterative knocks.For static state and dynamic state, we can only refer to their holding at a certain time point.
In otherwords, delimitative and process describe the life cycle of a state.
For example, ta1 bing4 zhe0 ne0 ?he isill?
and ta1 wan3shang4 jiu3dian3 de0 shi2hou0 zai4 pao3bu4 ?He was running at 9:00pm?.
It is alsopossible to claim that in a certain period, which for some reason became the focus of a conversation, astate holds.
For example, ta1 na4 liang3 tian1 dou1 bing4 zhe0 ?he was ill in that two days?
and ta1wan3shang4 jiu3dian3 dao4 shi2dian3 de0 shi2hou0 zai4 pao3bu4 ?From 9:00pm to 10:00pm, he wasrunning?.
In this case, they are also state rather than delimitative or process.
The difference is that thereis no information about the starts and the ends, while delimitative and process do.Accomplishment is composed by a process with a final state.
For example, ta1 xie3 le0 yi1 feng1 xin4?he wrote a letter?
describes an accomplishment composed by a writing process with a final state, i.e.the existence of the letter.
The final state of an accomplishment could also be dynamic.
For example, ta1ba3 dian4nao3 qi3dong4 le0 ?he started up the computer?
describe an accomplishment with a dynamicfinal state, i.e.
the normal working of computer.Some Resultative Verb Compounds (RVCs) in Chinese can denote achievements.
However, they areeasy to be confused with accomplishment.
Based on the representation, the difference of them is thataccomplishment encodes the start of the dynamic process, while achievement doesn?t.
For example, ta1xie3 wan2 le0 na4 feng1 xin4 ?He (write-)finished the letter?
describes a DS change.
To differentiatethem, we can use the yi3qian2 ?before?
test.
As in this example, ta1 xie3 wan2 na4 feng1 xin4 yi3 qian2?before he finished the letter?
refers to the period that includes the writing process.
This means that160RVCs only focus on the final culminating point and are thus achievements.
On the other hand, ta1 xie3na4 feng1 xin4 zhi1 qian2 ?before he wrote the letter?
refers to the period before the writing process.
So,ta1 xie3 le0 yi1 feng1 xin4 ?he wrote a letter?
is then an accomplishment.There is a counterpart for accomplishment, which is composed by an instantaneous dynamic process(semelfactive) with a final state.
RVCs can also denote instantaneous accomplishment.
For example, ta1da3sui4 le0 yi1 ge4 bei1zi0 ?he hit and broke a cup?
is an accomplishment composed by a semelfactivehitting action with a final state, i.e.
the broken of the cup.
Similarly, the final state could also bedynamic.
For example, in ta1 tan2zhuan4 le0 yi1 ge4 shai3zi0 ?He flicked and putted a spin on thedice?, the predicate tan2zhuan4 ?flick-spin?
is a compound that combines the predicate tan2 ?flick?
andzhuan4 ?spin?.
The whole event is composed by a semelfactive flicking and a final dynamic state of thedice?s spin.Table 2 shows the seven event types with examples.
Theoretically, there could be unlimited numberof complex events.
However, the notions listed here are important in that they are the lexicalized unitswhich reflect the human?s cognition of real world events.
For the perspective of computational linguis-tics, discriminating all these linguistic events will be a fundamental step for deeper natural languageunderstanding.2.3.3 The Neutral AspectSome sentences don?t include an explicit viewpoint aspect, e.g.
without any aspectual markers.
Forexample, ta1 kan4 xiao3shuo1 ?he read novel?
can possibly denote different event types in differentcontexts.
yi3qian2, ta1 kan4 xiao3shuo1 ?he read novel before?
denotes an attribute of the subjectthat he reads novels, while da4jia1 dou1 hen3mang2, xiao3hai2er0 xie3 zuo4ye4, ta1 kan4 xiao3shuo1?Everyone is busy, children are doing homework, he is reading novels?
describes a dynamic state.
Theaspects of these examples are given by the specified contexts.
Such sentences are usually called withNEUTRAL aspect (Smith, 1991).
In our framework, such sentences are ignored for now, unless thecontext can help the annotator to figure out the aspectual information.Semelfactive |?| ta1 qiao1 le0 qiao1 men2 ?he knocked the door?Delimitative |?-| ta1 bing4 le0 yi1 ge4 xing1qing1 ?he was ill for one week?Process |???
?| ta1 pao3 le0 yi1 ge4 xiao3shi2 ?he ran for an hour?Instantaneous |?|?
ta1 da3sui4 le0 bei1zi0 ?he broke the cup?Accomplishment |?|???
ta1 tan2zhuan4 le0 yi1 ge4 shai3zi0 ?He putted a spin on the dice?Accomplishment |????|?
ta1 xie3 le0 yi1 feng1 xin4 ?he wrote a letter?|????|???
ta1 ba3 dian4nao3 qi3dong4 le0 ?he started up the computer?Table 2: Complex event types that are composed by more than one primitives.The overall hierarchy is shown in Figure 1.
Some traditional notions are kept in use e.g.
accomplish-ment and achievement.
However, they now refer to event types rather than verb classes.3 Annotating a Chinese Corpus3.1 Data SelectionFor annotation, we choose Sinica Treebank 3.0 (Huang et al., 2000), which contains more than 60,000trees.
Sinica Treebank is a subset of Sinica Corpus (Chen et al., 1996), which is a balanced corpus thatcontains different genres of materials, including news, novels and some transcripts of spoken Chinese.Sinica Treebank is annotated based on the Information-based Case Grammar (Chen and Huang, 1990).The annotated syntactic and semantic information is kept for further studies, e.g.
feature evaluation andselection.For annotation, we only select the sentences that are labeled as S and end with punctuation of period??
?, exclamation ??
?, semicolon ???
and question mark ???.
After removing duplicate sentences, weget 5612 sentences Table 3 shows the detailed information of the raw corpus.
There are 45728 tokensfrom 11681 types in the corpus.
For the heads of the sentences, there are 2127 different verbs.161Figure 1: Sentence type hierarchy.Sentences Different Verbs Different Words Tokens Characters5612 2127 11681 45728 75960Table 3: Distribution information of the corpus for annotation.3.2 Annotation ResultEach sentence is labeled as one specific finer-grained category from the 23 categories described in Sec-tion 2.
Whenever an example could not be decided by the annotator, it is discussed with another twolinguistic experts to make the final decision.
However, we also did agreement test, which will be dis-cussed later.Finally, we annotated 1044 instances in modality, 764 speech act instances and 3811 event instances.The distribution information is shown in Table 4.
We can see that some event types, although theoreticallyexist, don?t encounter any examples, such as the instantaneous accomplishment with dynamic finalstate: |?|??
?.Static state contains more than 40% instances.
We think that it reflects the real distribution of eventtypes as we don?t make any bias for selecting data.
Static state can be further divided into severalsubcategories, e.g.
attributive, relational, habitual, etc., which will be our future work.Type No.

2Table 4: Distribution of different event types in the annotated corpus.Table 5 shows the number of the main verbs regarding howmany event types they can denote excludingmodality and speech act.
We can see that more than 200 verbs correspond to more than one category.This shows that the verbs alone sometimes could not determine the event type.162No.

all the 2000 examples.3.3 Agreement EvaluationIn order to test the reliability of the annotation, we randomly select 2000 examples from the corpus andlet another two linguists annotate them.
Each of the linguists annotate half of them.
The annotationresults are then compared with the main annotator.
The agreements between the main annotator and theother two annotators in terms of accuracy, F1 measure and Kappa value are shown in Table 6.
The F1measures are calculated based on the assumption that the main annotator?s result is the gold standard.
Theresult shows a very high agreement which means that our new framework for event type classification isreliable and easy for annotation.4 Automatic Classification of Chinese Sentences and Event TypesIn this section, we conduct two classification experiments.
The first is to discriminate the three sentencetypes regarding their main functions, speech act, modality and event.
The second is the classificationwith the finer-grained categories.
Before the experiments, we will first discuss the features that may helpfor the classification.4.1 FeaturesAs suggested in previous literatures (Siegel, 1999; Siegel and McKeown, 2000; Zhu et al., 2000; Cao etal., 2006), the following features are considered as important for event type classification.Main verbs and their complements including argument structure are the most important indicators toan event type.
Negation of the main verb is a strong indicator for static state, as discussed above.Aspectual markers, ?
zhe0 ?ZHE?, ?
le0 ?LE?, ?
guo4 ?GUO?
and some aspectual light verbs,e.g.
?
zai4 ?be doing?, ??
kai1shi3 ?start?, ??
ji4xu4 ?continue?, ??
ting2zhi3 ?stop?, ?
?wan2cheng2 ?finish?, are strong indicators for different event types.Temporal adverbials are also important features, which could potentially disambiguate neutral sen-tences, e.g., yi3qian2, ta1 kan4 xiao3shuo1 ?he read novel before?
as discussed above.Frequency adverbs, such as??
jing1chang2 ?often?,??
ou3er3 ?sometimes?, etc., are indicatorsfor habitual states.
For example, ta1 jing1chang2 qu4 he1jiu3 ?he often goes for drinking?
is a habitualstate rather than a specific event.Modalities could be expressed by auxiliaries, adverbs, sentence final particles etc.
in Chinese.
Adverbsthat modify the main verb, such as ??
ke3neng2 ?possibly?, are important features for identifyingmodalities.
Sentence final particles (SFP) and punctuation marks are also good indicators to evaluativemodality.Since we don?t maintain a dictionary for the above indicators, we use a general feature set includingthe dependency structure and the combinations of the dependent constituents.
We suggest that the abovelinguistic rules could be reflected by the dependency structures, which could be captured by the classi-fiers.
Meanwhile, the experiment result here is only to serve as a baseline for future comparisons.
In all,the features are listed in Table 7 with some examples.163ID Feature Examplef1Head head:word:kan4, head:pos:verb,head:subj:word:ta1, head:subj:pos:pron,head:obj:xp:NP, head:obj:xp:noun-nounf2Dependency dep:word:ta1, dep:pos:pron,dep:word:bu4, dep:pos:adv,dep:word:xiao3shuo1, dep:pos:noun,dep:word:le0, dep:pos:particle,f3COMB subj:word:ta1-head:word:kan4-obj:xp:noun-noun,subj:pos:pron-head:pos:verb-obj:xp:NP,Table 7: Feature template we use for our classification of event types.

Instead, weuse the Stanford word segmenter (Tseng et al., 2005) and Stanford parser (Chang et al., 2009) to get thesyntactic structure of the sentences.
All the experiment are results of 5-fold cross validation with a SVMclassifier implemented in LibSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011).The result of the coarse level classification for modality, event and speech act is shown in Table 8.We can see that the overall performance is reasonable.
The F-Measure for modality is not as good asthe others.
This is due to the fact that the modal markers and operators are quite critical for identifyingmodalities, which may be sparse in our corpus.
We suggest that maintaining a comprehensive dictionaryof modal operators could benefit the identification of the modalities.
We can also see that the feature setf3harms the performance, which is also caused by the feature sparseness problem.For finer-grained classification, we use two different ways.
The first way is to use a hierarchicalclassification scheme.
An instance is first classified as event, modality or speech act.
According to theresult of the first round classification, the instance is put into the corresponding finer-grained model forfurther classification.
The second way is to classify all instances all at once based on a model trained onall finer-grained categories.Considering that some categories contain only few examples, which will provide unreliable evaluationof the performance, we combined accomplishments with static final state and dynamic state, so does forinstantaneous accomplishment.
We use ?=?
to denote a general state, which could be either static or dy-namic.
Static state and delimitative are combined together, while dynamic state, process and semelfactiveare combined.
Expressive, declarative and DD change are ignored in the experiments.
The classificationresults with feature sets f1and f2are shown in Table 9.
The hierarchical classification is slightly betterthan the all-at-once classification.
Meanwhile, the accuracy for hierarchical classification is 0.621, whichis much better than the predominant guess 0.443.We should note that parsing accuracy will significantly affect the result of event type classification.This is true in the sense that the semantic content of words and their syntactic relations are all critical164All-At-Once HierarchicalPrecision Recall F1 Precision Recall F1?

Besides the parsing problem, there are other linguistic issues behind.
Many modaloperators could result in different modalities, such as??
ying1gai1 ?should?,?
hui4 ?will/can/may?,?
yao4 ?want/will/should/must?
etc.
Sometimes, it is hard to decide which meaning is correct in acontext.
There may be also other linguistic issues that we have not discovered yet.
This corpus thuscould be used for both linguistic study and computational applications, e.g.
event processing.5 ConclusionIn this paper, we present a Chinese corpus annotated with modalities, speech acts and finer-grained even-t types.
We also provide experiments on classification in different levels of categories with a generalfeature set.
The experimental result is acceptable concerning the difficult linguistic issues behind.
In fu-ture, we would like to continue our research work on improving the corpus and exploring more semanticinformation including lexical semantic structures and lexical relations such as WordNet to improve theperformance of the classification.AcknowledgementsThe work is supported by a General Research Fund (GRF) sponsored by the Research Grants Council(Project no.
