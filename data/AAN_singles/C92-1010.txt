In this example, one wordm Turkisll corresponds to a fllll sentence in English.Each suitix has a certain flmction and modifies thesemantic information in the steni preceding it.
In ourexample, the root mori'~heme ~EKOSLOVAKYA isthe nalne of the country Czechoslovakia and the suffix- /,I converts the meaning into Czechoslovakian, whilethe following suffix LA~ makes a verb from the pre-vious stem meaning to become a Czechoslovakian, t,and so o11.2.1.
Turk ish  Phonet ic  Mode lBeing phonetic, the Turkish language can be adal)tedt.o a number of different alphabets.
In the, past, var-ious alphabets haw~ been used to transcribe Turkish,e.g., Arabic.
Since 1928, Latin characters have beenused.
The Turkish alphabet consists of 29 letters ofwhich 8 (A, E, I, L O, (3, U, (~) are vowels, and 21(B ,C ,C~,D,F ,G , (L  H, J ,K ,  L ,M.N,P ,R ,S , ,q , ,q, V, Y, Z) are consonants.Turkish word formation uses a number of phoneticharlrlony rules.
Vowels and COltSOllants change in cer-tain ways when a suffix is apl)ended to a root, so thatsucll harnlony constraints are not violated.2.1.1.
Vowcl  Change iti Suff ixesAhnost all suffixes in Turkish ilse one of two basicvowels and their allophones.
We have denoted thesesets of allophones with braces around the main vowelsA and 1. as {A} and {I}.
The allophones of {At  are Aand E, where {It represents I, i, U, or {r. The vowelsO and (} are only used in root inorl)hemes (especiallyin the first syllable) of Turkish words.
~The vowel harltlOllV rtlies require thai vowels in a silt Lfix challge according to certain rules whell they are af-fixed to a stem.
The first vowel in thr suftix changesaccording to the last vowel of the sl.em.
Succeedingvowels ili tile suffix change according to the vowel pre-reding it.
If we denole the preceding vowel (lie it inthe sten, or in the suffix) by v then {At is resolved asA if r is A, 1.
O. or U. otherwise it is resolved as E.OiL the other band, {I} is resolw~d as \[ if e is A or 1. asi i fe i sEor i ,  as U if t: is O or U. and as 0 if v is (3 orU.
For examl)le the word "YAPMAYACAI,7.TINIZ"can be broken htto sutiixes as:YA I ' /M  {A)/\[Y\]: '{ A )C{A} { t'~)4/{l)}S {I}/N {I}Zi \[qom nm~ on.

w~" have con-structed a legular expression and a corresponding finile stale automaton for validating if a word matchesthe syl lablestructttre ules of Turkish \[18\] This reg+/llar t?xpr0ssiOll is tised as a heuristic ill oltr spellingchecker.
The input word is first processed with theregular expression.
It is reported as misspelled if itssyllaMe structure can not be mat.ched wilh this ex-pression, i.e., tile phonemes of Ihe word do no!
formvalid sequences accordiug to Turkish syllable struc-iurcs.
()n tile other hand, if it.
can lie matched, it, isflu'ther analyzed as it.
tuay still be a non-Turkish or amisspelled word.With th(- hell> of tile syllal)ificat.ion cheek, most of thetypographical e.rrors Call be detected.
For examph~.if the word YAPMAI(  (to make) were typed as YP-.\I,\I,2 or YAPMKA.
the word would not be matchedby the expression and its spelling wouhl be reportedincorrect.
On tile other hand, ifil, wew written asYAPMEI( ,  where a vowel harmony error is made, itwould pass the syllabification cheek, but would lie re-porled as misspelled during morl/holJhonemic checks.3.3 .
Root  Determinat ionBefore analyzing the morpholAmnenfic and morphological structures of a Tm'kish word, the root has tobe determined.
If \[he word passes the syllabificationcheck, its root is searched in the dictionary rising amaxilnal match algorithm.
In this algorithm, lirst; \[he list of all \[lags can Im hmnd in Solak \[2(1\].AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO6-r 1992 42the whole word is searched in the dictionary, If itis found then the word has no suffixes and thereforeits spelling is correct.
Otherwise, we remove a letterfrom tile right and search tile restllting substring.
Wecontinue this by removiug letters from the right untilwe find a root.
If no root can be found although thefirst letter of the word is reached, tile word is reportedas misspelled.The max imum length substring of the word that ispresent in tile dictionary is riot always its root.
Iffin't.her analyses how that the word is misspelled, anew root is searched m the dictionary, this time re-moving letters from the end of the previous root.. Ifa Ilew root can be found the same operations are re-peated, otherwise tile word is reported &s misspelled.Root determination presents some dittieulties wheuthe root of the word is deformed.
For the root wordswhich have to be deformed during certain aggluti-nations, a flag indicating that property is set in thedictionary.
For example, the root of the word ,~EHRE(to the city) must be found as ~jglt iR (city).
In orderto determine it correctly, when the substring SEHR isnot found in the dictionary, considering that it illaybe a deforined root by vowel ellipsis, the vowel I isinserted between the consonants 11 and R, and theword ~EHIR is searched in the dictionary.
When itis fotmd, tile flag corresponding to vowel ellipsis ischecked.
Since it is set for this word, the root of theword S,'I';IIRE is dcterlnined as ~EI I iR,  and remain-ins analyses are contiuued.
If that word were writtenas .~EHiRE, we should report it ms incorrect although~Elt iR + dative ease suffix form looks correct.
For allother root defin'mations, the real root of the word canbe fotnld by u/aking such cheeks and some necessarychauges (see \[20\]).For some roots both of the refills above are valid.For example, both METN\[  (accusative of text) andMETiN\]\[ (accusative of strong) are correct althoughthe root of both words is MET\[N (text, strong) be-catlse this word call be used in twodifferent meanings.3.4 .
Morphophonemic  CheckTurkish words obey vowel and COllSOll~lllt harmouyrules during agglutination (see sections :3.2.1 and3.2.2).

As a re-sub, the number of parsers developed for agghitina-five languages, and particularly for Turkish, is quitelimit.ed, and they have certain shortcomings.
We havesolved most of the problelns encountered in the previ-ous parsers by lnaking a detailed and careful researchon Turkish word formation rules and their exceptions\[20\].
These results may hopefully be helpful for fu-ture researchers on Turkish linguistics.
