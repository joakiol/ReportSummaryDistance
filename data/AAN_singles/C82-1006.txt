Error-free and fast analysis, partial interpretationab i l i ty ,  man-machine dialogue trend, different semantic envi-ronment adaptability and natural language usage are its maincharacteristics.
All of these features are supported by atechnique of input re l iab i l i ty  evaluation.
Particular atten-tion is devoted to the description of the knowledge internalrepresentation and of the mechanism that manages, at diffe-rent points of the analysis, the whole process.I.
PARSER QUALIFICATIONSThe parser to be described performs its analysis starting from an intr ins ical ly  un-reliable input that is the result of an isolated word speech recognizer.
The lackof certainty on the single items of the input sentence is one of the main problemsin such a vocal parser.
The representation of each uttered word, following the re-cognition stage, is, in fact, an ordered l i s t  of possible interpretations with as-sociated dissimilarity measures.
As a consequence, i t  is possible to have doubtsnot only about every single word of the sentence, but also on complete sentenceparts.
Moreover, irrecoverable recognition errors may require the capability ofparsing incomplete sentences.Spoken Sentences: TOGLI TUTTO DALLA STANZAParsing Input :word dis word d is  ~ord dis word disI ~IOgLI I32.

IFigure lEXAMPLE OF A TYPICAL INPUT OF THE PARSERFig.
1 shows an example of a typical parsing input where each input word is repla-ced by a complete l i s t  of possible alternatives with associated distance score.
I t3738 L. BORGHESI and C. FAVARETOis interest ing to notice that not only the sentence that was actual ly  spoken "TO-GLI TUTTO DALLA STANZA" (= remove everything from the room), is reported but, inthis case, also some other correct sentences can be found by the parser ( for ex-ample "COSTRUISCI UN TAVOLO QUADRATO" (bui ld a square table) .An e f f i c ient  parser must also be able to solve other problems not s t r i c t ly  connec-ted to a part icu lar  kind of input.
In fact i t  should, of course, achieve fast ope-rat ions;  that requires the ab i l i ty  to minimize the number of a l ternat ive  parses\[l\].Furthermore the parser should be designed in such a way as to sat is fy  the "genera-l i ty "  expectations; that is i t  should be easi ly  adaptable to any semantic domain atleast in the l imited semantic domain cases.
Since the parser results should be followed by the execution of some operation in any practical appl icat ion i t  is requi Tred that i t  produced t rusty  results and, in part icu lar ,  that i t  always included ther ight  sentence interpretat ion within a l l  the output ones.F ina l ly ,  to allow a graceful dialogue with i ts  users the parser must be able toanalyse also part ia l  sentences ( for  example e l l ip t i ca l  or fragmentary ones), thus ma Zking i t  possible to use natura l ly  expressed sentences C2\].2.
MAIN PARSER'S CHARACTERISTICSThe main features of our parser, that permit to sat is fy  the above mentioned requi-rements, are the fol lowing:I )  representation of the language in terms of a network whose elements are syn-tact ic  groups and syntactic features;2) de f in i t ion  of a confidence measure of the recognition results and i t s  exten-sion also to groups of words (syntactic groups);3) adoption of a recursive working strategy which anchors the parsing on themost re l iab le  words in a f i r s t  step and on the most re l iab le  groups in a se-cond one.We selected the furnishing of a l i v ing  room as the discourse domain and we defineda vocabulary of a I16 words.This vocabulary, although l imited,  leads to a tota l  number of over 10 5 possiblesentences that include commands for constructing or moving pieces of furn i ture ,  as-signment of labels,  d e f ~ o f  unit  lengths, inquir ies about mutual distances~--e-TCT.2.1.
Language representationWe describe each sentence of the language by a sequence of syntactic groups.
A sy~tact ic  group is defined as a sentence part with a well precise semantic meaning.Often, but not necessary, a syntactic group corresponds to a classical grammaticalobject.
For example, we defined the verb, the d i rect  object,  the location object,etc.In this way (see Fig.
2) each sentence of the langudge can be described by a se-quence of some of these groups.On the whole we introduced only 9 groups; in our opinion this set of syntacticgroups is enough to describe, at a syntactic leve l ,  a l l  the possible sentences pe~tain ing to this semantic environment.FLEXIBLE PARSING OF DISCRETELY UTTERED SENTENCES 39o.< Verb >< Location Obj.>< Indirect Obj.>< Dimension Obj.> I~/ <Ouant.> IIIII < s ec.

So the present voca-bulary can be easily increased to a certain degree within the semantic domain, without any change in the grammar.2.2.
Reliability evaluationThe doubts connected with the vocal input suggested the need for a tool that mea-sured the goodness of each word recognition.
To this purpose a method to evaluatethe rel iabi l i ty of recognition results was defined \[3\].40 L BORGHESlandC.
FAVARETOBy this method every word, in the ordered l i s t ,  is associated with a confidencescore indicating its probability of being the correct one (see Fig.

The same re l iab i l i ty  score is also used toevaluate the syntactic groups found and to decide which, among alternative groups,is the most probable one.2.3 Island driven workin 9 strategyAll the operations of the parser are centered around the concept of re l iab i l i tyscore.
In fact, in a f i rst  step, the parser anchors its analysis to the most re-liable word of the sentence (that we named "guide word") and searches, both to theright and to the left o f i t fo ra l l  the syntactic groups that include the features as-sociated to the guide word.
Each of these syntactic groups is named "island".Not only the f i rst  word in the ordered l i s t  can be used for this aim, but sometimesalso the second and the third ones are taken into consideration.
For each islanda cumulative re l iab i l i ty  score, function of the single word scores, is computed.The same procedure is then applied to the remaining words unt i l the whole sentencehas been examined and there are no more guide words; at this point a lattice ofisland, possibly overlapping, is obtained.In a second step the parser, in an almost identical fashion as before, searches forthe most reliable island (that we named "guide island"), anchoring to i t  the explo-ration of the language network to get a match with one of the possible sentences.When this is not possible, because of very unreliable recognition of a whole syn-tactic group, the partial sentence recovered is proposed in output together with ahypothesis about the missing constituent.At this point a module for graceful man-machine interaction could be activated, inorder to obtain the needed information by meansofan appropriate dialogue.In addition there are some parameters, specifying the number of retained alternati-ves at various points of the parsing, that allow to control parser's performanceboth in terms of speed and confidence.
These parameters allow the parser to workwith different degrees of f lex ib i l i ty  and so, they must be carefully selected, ac-cording to the application, i.e.
according to the risk that can be tolerated whenaccepting an acoustically unclear sentence.FLEXIBL~ PARSING OF DISCRETELY UTTERED SENTENCES 4\]3.
RUNNING EXAMPLESIn Fig.

?THE CHAIR .40 |islandsINTO THE ROOM ,31 J ON THE TABLE ,11INTO THE ROOMThe input sentence is: PUT THE ROUND TABLE INTO THE ROOM.
In the f i r s t  step, star-ting respectively from the I st, 2 nd and 3rd guide word (PUT, ROUND, THE), the par-ser finds some possible islands with associated re l iab i l i ty  score.
In a secondstep, starting from the guide island the parser searches a match between a path inthe language network and the islands.
The final result is the correct interpreta-tion of the sentence even i f  there were three recognition errors.Sometimes the parser outputs are not univocal as in the previous example.
In fact,i f  the re l iab i l i ty  score of a whole island is too low, the parser provides an out-put in which, instead of a detailed word-by-word interpretation, an hypothesisabout the type of the missing syntactic group appears as shown in the example be-low:PUT < direct object > IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOMI f ,  on the contrary, tnere are two or more words with approximately the same reliab i l i ty  score and the same syntactic role, then the parser supplies in the output -those alternatives with their associated re l iab i l i ty  scores and the whole decisionwil l  be deferred to a following pragmatic module or dialogue component.
For exam-ple we can have an output l ike this one:PUT THE I TABLE CHAIR .32.29 I NUMBER TWO IN FRONT OF THE DOOR4.
RESULTSThe present parser has been tested on a'set of 50 sentences spoken by three diffe-rent speakers (two males and one female).
A poor word recognizer was adopted in order to stress parser's capabilities.
We compare in table l the parser performanceTand those of the recognizer a~one.
For each speaker the f i rs t  column reports thepercent of success of the recognizer alone, i .e.
how many times all the words of asentence were in the f i r s t  position.
The second column reports the percent of suc-ces of the parser ( i .e.
how many times the parser was able to interpret the sen-tence).Each row corresponds to a case in which there are, respectively, none,l, 2, and 3lost islands whose re l iab i l i ty  was not sufficient to take any decision.42 L. BORGHESI and C. FAVARETOWe want to notice that for the I st speaker the parser locates the correct sentencein the 92% of the cases and achieves a 96% correct interpretation i f  i t  assumesthat there is one lost island.
For the 2 nd speaker these values increase more slowly because of a very unreliable input (10% of success for the recognizer).However the main result is that the parser never took a decision that did not con-tain the correct interpretation.I ; I .

CONCLUSIONSWe have described a parser of spoken sentences in which the design decisions takenare a necessary step to satisfy the requirements of a voice interactive system.In fact the choice of using features instead of vocabulary entries and of descri-bing the sentences in terms of syntactic groups agrees with the needs of improvingthe analysis speed, of making the semantic environment representation oriented toa partial interpretation analysis and of allowing the adaptability to different semantic environments.Finally we want to notice the characteristics that make this parser oriented to agraceful man-machine interaction.
They are its ab i l i ty  to provide in the outputmore than one choice with its associated re l iab i l i ty  score and its ab i l i ty  to in-terpret alo partial input.The f i rs t  characteristic, in fact, allows a pragmatic module to make a choice amongvarious alternatives, looking at their re l iab i l i ty  score or, i f  in doubt, to acti-vate a dialogue module which requests the needed information.
The second charac-ter ist ic  permits the management of a dialogue in which also e l l ipt ica l  sentencesare allowed or, anyhow, the maximum freedom of expression is permitted.REFERENCES:Ell Woods W.A., Syntax, semantics and speech, in: Reddy D.R.
