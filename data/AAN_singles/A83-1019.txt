INTRODUCTIONA.
Overview of the PaperIn an age of increased attention to theproblems of database organization re t r ieva lproblems and query languages, one o f  the majoreconomic problems of  many potent ia l  databasesremains the entry of the original information intothe database.
A large amount of such informationis currently available in natural language text,and some of that text is of a higi~ly stylizednature, with a restricted semantic domain.
It isthe task of specialized information extract ion(SIE) systems to obtain information automaticallyfrom such texts  and place i t  in the database.
Aswith any system, it is desirable to minimizeerrors and human intervention, bur a total absenceof either i s  not necessary for the system to beeconomically viabl~.

Box 3554, Gaithersburg,Maryland 20278.109In ~his paper, we will first discuss somegeneral characterlstics of SIE systems, thendescr ibe  the  deve lopment  of an experimental sys temto assist in the coastructlon of a database ofchemical reaction information.
Many Journals,such as the Journal of Or~anlc Chemistry, haveseparate experimental sections, in which ~heprocedures  fo r  p repar ing  chemica l  compounds aredescr ibed .
I t  i s  des i red  to ext rac t  cer ta inin fo rmat ion  about  these  react ions  and p lace  i t  inthe  database .
A react ion  in fo rmat ion  form (RIF)was deve loped  in another  p ro jec t  to conta in  thedes i red  information.
The purpose of the system istO eliminate the necessity in a majority ofcases ,  fo r  a t ra ined  reader  to read the text andenter  the  P.IF in fo rmat ion  in to  the  mach ine .B.
Some Termino logyIn the discussion below, we shall use theterm ~rammmr to mean a system conslstin 8 of alexicon s a s~ntax, a meanin~ representation lan-guage, and a z~nt lc  mapping.
The lexiconconsists of the ~st  of words in the language andone or more grammatical categories for each word.The syntax specifies the structure of sentences inthe language in terms of the  grammar icalcategories.
Morphological procedures may specifya "syntax" within classes of words and therebyreduce the size of the lexicon.
A discourses t ruc ture ,  or extrasentential syntax, may also beinc luded.The semantic mapping provides ~oc eachsyntact ical ly correct sentence a meaning repre-sentation in  the  meaning representat ion  language,and it is the  crux of the  whole system.
~f thesemantic mapping is fundamentally straightforward,then the syntactic processing can often bereduced, as well.
This is one of the virtues o~SIt systems: Because Of the specialized sub jec tmatter, one can simplify syntactic process \ [n~through the  use of ad hoc procedures  (e i theralgorithmic or heuristic).
In many ca~es ,  t:heknowledge that allows this is nonlinguist icknowledge, which may be encoded tn frames.Although this is not always the sense in which"frame" is used, this is the sense in which weshall use the term in our discussion below:Frames encode non l tngu ls t i c  "expectat ions"  brouRhtto bear on the task.
~n this light, it is inter-esting to ~xplore the subject of case-slot Iden-tity, as raised by Charnlak (\[981).
if the slotsare components of framesmand cases are names forarguments of a predicate, then the slots in anypractical language understanding system may notcorrespond exactly co the cases in a language.
\[nfact.
the predicates may not  correspond to theframes.
On the other hand, if the language iscapable of expressing all of the dlstinctio~m thatcan be understood in terms of the frames, onewould expect them to grow closer and closer as thesystem became less specialized.
The decision asto whether to maintain the distinction betweenpredlcat e/case and frame/slot has a "Whor flan"flavor to it.
We have chosen to maintain thatdis c Inct ion.Despite the general decision with regardsto predicates and slots, some of the grammaticalcategories in our work do not correspond preciselyto conventional grammatical categories, but arespecialized for the reaction information project.An example i s  "chemical name", This illustratesanother reason that SIE systems are more practicalthan  more general language understanding systems:One can use certain ad hoc categories based  uponthe characteristics of the problem (and of theunderlying meanings represented).
This idea wasadvocated several years ago by Thompson (\[966) andused in the design of a specialized database querysystem ( DFACON).
Its problem in more generallanguage processing appllcac ions - that thecategories may not extend readily from one domainto another and may actually complicate the generalgrammar - does not  cause as much difficulty in theSIE case.
The danger of using ad hoc categoriesis, of course, that one can lose extensibility,and must make careful decisions in advance as tohow specialized the SIE system is going to be.II.
SPECIALIZED INFORMATION EXTRACTIONA.
Characteristics of the SIr TaskThe term "specialized information extrac-tion" is necessarily a relative one.
Informationextraction can range from the simplest sorts oftasks like obtaining all names of people men-Cloned in newspaper articles, to a full under-standing of relatively free text.
The simplest ofthese require of the program little linguistic orempirical knowledge, while the most complexrequire more knowledge than we know how to lye.But when we refer to an SIE task, we will mean onethat.
"(l) Deals with a restricted subjectmatter(2)  Requires Information chat can beclassified under a limited number ofdiscrete parameters, and(3) Deals with language of a specializedtype, usually nar ra t ive  reports.SIE programs are more feasible thanautomatic translation because the restrictionslessen the ambiguity problems.
This is even truein comparison to other tasks with a restrictedsubject matter, such as natural language computerprogrammln 8 or database query.
Furthermore, theselatter tasks require a very low error rate inorder co be useful, because users will nottolerate either ineorrect results or constantqueries and requeSts for rewording from theprogram, while SIr programs would be successful ifthey produced results in, say, 80% of cases andrequired that the information extraction be doneby humans In the ochers.
Even small rat:es ofundetected errors would be tolerable in manysicuatlons, though one would wish co minimizethemThe lessened syntactic variety in SIEtasks means that the amount of syntactic analysisneeded is lessened, and also the complexity of themachinery for the semantic mapping.
At the sametime, the specialized semantic domain allows theuse of empirical knowledge to increase theefficiency and effectiveness of analysis proce-dures (the lessening of ambiguity being only oneaspect of this).The particular cases of SIr that we havechosen are highly structured paragraphs, describ-ing laboratory procedures for synthesizing organicsubstances which were taken from =he experimentalsection of articles in J. Or\[.
Chem.
Our feelingis that the full text of chemical articles isbeyond the state of the SIr art, if one wants toextract anything more than trivial information;hut the limited universe of discourse of theexperimental paragraphs renders SIr on themfens i b le.l lOB.
The En~lneer ins  of SIE STsteawS ince the  days of the  ear ly  mechan ica lt rans la t ion  e f fo r ts ,  the  amount of s tudy  ofnatura l  l anguage phenomena, both  from the  po in t  ofv iew of  pure theory  and of determin ing  spec i f i cfac ts  about languages ,  has been substant ia l .S imi la r ly ,  techn iques  fo r  dea l ing  w i th  languagesand o ther  sor ts  of complex in fo rmat ion  by computerhave been cons iderab ly  extended and the  work hasbeen fac i l i ta ted  by the  prov is ion  of h igher - leve lprogramming languages  and by the  ava i lab i l i ty  offas ter  machines and increased  s torage .

Fa i l ing  to have a complete  grammar ofthe  language over  which one w ishes  to have STE,one uses heur i s t i cs  to determine  features  that  onewants .
At the  same t ime,  one uses the  sc ient i f i cknowledge ava i lab le ,  inso far  as that  i s  feas ib le .One bu i lds  and tes ts  model or  p i lo t  sys tem toexp lore  problems and techn iques  and t r ies  coext rapo la te  the  exper ience  to  product ion  sys tems,which themselves are likely ~o have to be"incrementally developed".In any engineering rout  ext, eva luat ionmeasures a re  impor tant .
These measures  a l low oneCo set criteria for acceptability of designs whichare likely always to be imperfect, and to comparealternative systemS.
The ultimate evaluation~easure on which management decisions rest isusually cosc/benefi~ ratio.
This can be decer-mined only after examining the h,~an alternativesand their effectiveness.
It is important to beable Co quantify these alternatives, and this isoften not done.
For instance, it is common toassume chat an automaclc system should not produceerrors, whereas humans always do; so the percent-age of errors should be determined experimentallyin  each case  and compared.For the  eva luat ion  of SIE sys tems,  wewould l i ke  to  propose  three  measures ;(1)  Robustness  - the  percentage  ofinputs  hand led .
Most rea l  SIE sys -cm wi l l  re jec t  cer ta in  inputs ,  sothe  rob~tness  ~r l l l  be one minus theparc4n~ags  re jec ted .
(2) Accuracy the  percentage  ofthose  inputs  hand led  which are  cor -rec t ly  hand led .
(3) E r ro r  ra te  - the  percentage  ofe r ronao~ ent r ies  w i th in  incor rec t lyan  hand led  input .P robab ly  the  most d i f f i cu l t  aspect  of SIEeng inear inE  i s  the  prov is ion  of a sa fe ty  fac tor  -an  ab i l i ty  o f  the  sys tem to recogn ize  inputs  thati t  cannot  hand le .
I t  i s  c lear  that  one can c reatea sys tem that  i s  robust  and acceptab ly  accuratewhich has unacceptab le  e r ror  ra tes  fo r  cer ta ininputs .
I f  the  sys tem i s  to be use fu l ,  i t  must beposs ib le  aueOmaeica l l~  to determine  which docu-ments conta in  unacceptab le  e r ror  ra tes .
I t  doesno good to determine  th i s  manua l ly ,  s ince  chac~ould nan  assent ia l l y  redo ing  a l l  of  the in fo r -: sc ion  ext rac t ion  m~nual 1y, and the  space of'doc, ments Is not su f f i c ient ly  uniform or con-t inuous thaC sampling methods would do any good.I t  appears, then,  that  the only way that  one isgoing to be able co provide a safety  fac tor  is tohave a system chat understands enough about thelinguistic and nonllngulstlc aspects of the textsto know when it is not understanding (at leastmost of the time).
We shall have more co sayabout the safety factor when we discuss our systembelow.One suggestion often made for "int el-l Igenc" systems is thac they be given someprovision for improving their performance by"learning".
Generally the problem with chlssuggestion is chat the complexity of the learningprocess is greater than chac of the originalsystem, and it is also unclear in many cases whatthe machine needs to learn.
It nevertheless seemsfeasible for SIE systems to learn by Interactionwith people who are dolng information extractiontasks.
The simplest case of this would be .~u 8-mentinK the lexicon, but ochers should be pos-sible.
The first step in chls process would be coI I Ibuild in a sufficient sa fe ty  factor that  mostincorrectly handled doc~anents can be explicitlyrejected.
The second would be Co localize thefactors that caused the rejection sufficiently tobe ab le  to ask fo r  help from the  person  doing themanual ext rac t ion  process .
A l though we havecons idered  th i s  aspect  of SIE development,  we haveoct  made any at tempt  to implement i t .A.
The Descr ip t ion  of ChmLtcal React ionsA par t i cu la r  task  that  would appear  to bea cand idate  fo r  STY, under the c r i te r ia  g ivenabove,  l s  the ext rac t ion  of in fo rmat ion  on chemi-cal  react ions  from exper imenta l  sect ions  of  chemi-ca l  Journals.
The Journal chosen for ourexperimental work was the Journal of Or~anlcChemistry,.
Two examples of reaction descriptionsfrom this Journal are shown in Figure 1.
Both ofthese examples have a particular type of discoursestructure, which we have called the "simplemodel".
The paragraphs  in the figure (hut not inthe actual texts) are div ided into four com-ponents: a heading, a synthesis, a work-upm and acharacterization.
Usually, the heading names thesubstance that is produced in the reaction, thesynthesis porclon describes the steps followed inconducting the reaction, the work-up poL~londescribes the recovery  of the substance from thereaction mixture, and the characterization portionpresents analytical data suppoL~Ing the structureassignment.
Most of the information that we wishto obtain Is in the synthesis port l on, whichdescribes the chemical reactants, reaction con-dltlons and apparatus.Figure 2 shows the Reaction InformationForm (R/F) designed to hold the required reactioninformation, with information supplied for the twoparagraphs illustrated in Figure 1.
One point tonotice i s  that not every piece of data is con-tained in every reaction description.
Thus thereare blanks Ln both examples, corresponding to\[nformar~.~,~ l~Ct u~speclfled in the correspondingr'~.rt~.~* des~:rlptions (those shown in Figure L).B.
An ~I~ S~5t~n for Reaction Information\[.
General Or~anlzationThe chemical reaction SIE is written inPL/I and runs on a 370/168 under TSO.
The t~stlngof certain of the algorithms and heuristics hasbeen done using SNOBOLA (SPITBOL) running underUNIX on a POP L I /70 .
The cho ice  of PL/ I  on the370 was d ic ta ted  by pract i ca l  cons iderat ionsinvolving the availability of textual m~Cerl~l ,the unusual format of that material, and theava i lab i l i ty  of ex is t ing  PL / I  rout ines  to dealwith  that  fo rmat ,The prosraum comprising each stage of thesystem are implemented modularly.
Thus the lexi-ca l  s tage  invo lves  separate  passes  fo r  ind iv idua ll ex ica l  ca tegor ies .
In  some cases, these are notorder-lndependent.
In the syntactic phase, theindividual modules are "word experts", and in thelast (extraction) phase ,  they are individual"frames" or components of f rames ,2.
The Lex ica l  StaGeIn the lexical stage, both dictionarylookup and morphological analysis are used toclassify words.
Morphological analysis proceduresinclude suf fix normalization, stemming and rootword lookup and analysis of internal p,mc~itation.Chemical substances may be identified by complexwords and phrases, and are therefore surprisinglydifficult to isolate&Both lexical and syntactic means are usedto isolate and tag chemical names.
In  the lexlcalstage, identifiable chemical roots, such as "benz"and terms, such as "Iso-" are tagged.
In thesyntactic stage, a procedure uses clues such asparenthetical expressions, internal commas and theoccurrence of Juxtaposed chemical roots to iden-tify chemical names.
This is really morphology,of course.
It also uses the overall syntax of thesentence to check whether a substance name isexpected and to dellmlt the chemical name.3.
The Syntactic StaseChemical substances which comprise thereactants and the products of a chemical reaction,as well as the reaction conditions and yield, areidentified by a hierarchical application of proce-dures.
The syntactic stage of the system has beenimplemented by application of word exper t  p roce-dures  to the data structures built durittg thelex~cal  stage.The word experts are based upon the !~sof Rieger and Small (1979) but It has not hfound to be necessary to ';~?

Two react ion  ?nformat ion  {ot i s ,  p roduced (manua l ly )  ?rom {:he descr tp -Cions of F igure i.i13turned out to resemble a s tandard  procedura limp lementat ion  (Wlnograd, 1971) (based most ly  onpar t i cu la r  words or  word categor ies ,  however) .The i r  funct ion  is  to determine the ro le  of a wordtaking lexical and syntactic context into con-sideration.
The word expeL'l: approach was ini-tially chosen because it enables the implemen-tation of fragments of a grammar and does notrequ i re  the development of a comprehens ive  gram-mar.
S ince i r re levant  por t ions  can be ident i f iedby reliable heuristics and eliminated, thisattribute is partlcularly useful in the SIE con-text.
The procedures also allow the incorporationof heuristics for isolat Ing cer~aln items ofinterest.In this context, it might be maintainedthat the interface between the syntax and thesemantic mapping is even less clean than in cer-tain other systems.
This is intentional.
BecauSeof the specialized nature of the process, we haveimplemented the "semantic counterpar~ of syntax"concept, as advocated by Thompson (1966), where wejudged that it would not impair the generality ofthe system within the area of reaction descrip-tions.
We have tried not to make decisions thatwould make it difficult to extend the system todescriptions of reactions that do not obey the"simple model".
The advantages of this approachwere discused in Sect ion  I .The system pays particular attention to verbarguments, which are generally marked byprepositions This "case" type analysis givespretty good direct clues to the function of itemswithin the meaning representation.
Sentencustructure is  relatively regular, though ext raposedphrases and a few types of clauses must be dealtwith.
Fortunately, the results, in terms offunction of chemicals and reaction conditions, arethe same whether the verb form is in an embeddedclause or the ~ain verb of the sentence.
Zn otherwords, we do not have to deal with the nuancesimplied by higher predicates, or with implicativeverbs, presuppositions, and the llke.4.
The Semantic Sta~eThe semantic mapping could be directly tothe components of the react ion  information form,and that is the approach that was implemented inthe first programs.
This gave reasonable resultsin some tes t  cases, but appeared co be less exten-slble to other models of reaction description thanIL4was desirable.
A SNOBOL4 version maps the syntaxto a predicate-arg,.ment formalism, with a caseframe for each verb designating the posslbte~rguments for each pred icate .5, The Extraction Sta~eThe meaning representat ion  gives a pret tyc lear  ind icat ion  of the  funct ion  of i tems w i th inthe RIF in  the s imple  model .
S ince we wadted toexperiment wlth generality in this system, wewished to separate general knowledge from linguis-tic knowledge, and fo r  that  reason ,  the  ac tua lext rac t ion  of i tems i s  done us ing  the  frame tech-n ique (Minaky, 1975; Charn iak ,  1975).In the literature, frames and similardevices vary both in their format and in theirfunction.
Tn some cases, the information thatthey encode is still linguistic, at  least in part.We are using them in the "nonllngulstlc" sense, asdiscussed in Section I.
~n our system, framesencode the expectations that  a trained readerwould brin E to the task of extracting informationfrom synthetic descriptions, involving the usualstructure of these descriptions.A frame is being developed initially forthe simple model.
This frame looks for the syn-thesis section, dlsc~ rd ing work-up and charac-r ,~ ' .?

~.L r .hen  focuses  onthe synthesis, whe -~' subframes correspond to theparticular entrle~ :~eeded in the RIF.As one example, the "time" frame expectsto find a series of re~=tlon step times in thedescription.
These are already labelled "time",and the frame will know that it has to total them.making approximations of such time expressions as"overnight" and indicating that the total tS thenapproximate.
Another example is the "temperature"frame, which expects a series of temperatures, andmust calculate the minimum and maximum, in orderto specify a range.
Again, a certain amount ofspecialized knowledge, such as the temperatureindicated by an ice water bat~, is necessary.C.
Evaluation of the S~s~emAs of the date of this paper, we have onlyexperimented with the version of the system thatmaps directly from the syntax into componu.
: ~the react ion  coding form.
As noted above, th i svers ion  does not have the genera l i ty  that  wedes i re ,  but  gives a pret ty  good ind icat ion  of thecapabilities of the system, as now Implemented.Am a tes t  of the system, we ran i t  onf i f ty  synthet ic  paragraphs  from the exper imenta lsect ions  of the J ourna l  of 0rsan ic  Ch ,~st ry ,  andth i r ty -s ix  were processed sat i s fac tor i l y .
Fourhad c lear ,  detectab le  problems,  so the  robustnesswas 92%, but the accuracy was only 78%, since tenof the paragraphs did not follow the simple model,and were never the less  processed .
Since these  werefu l l  of e r rors ,  we did not t ry  to compute a f igurefo r  average er ror  ra te .Although the ob jec t ive  of  bu i ld ing  th i sexper imenta l  system was only to deal  wi th  thes imple  model,  the exerc i se  has made c lear  to usthe importance of the sa fe ty  fac tor  in making asystem such as thls useful.
We in tend to continuawork with the present system only for a few weekS,meanwhile considering the problems and promises ofextending i t .fall within chi.~ paradigm include one constructedby the Operating Systems Division of Logicon(Silva, Montgomery and Dwiggins, 1979), which aimstO "atodel the cognitive activities of the htananana lys t  as he reads and unders tands  message text ,distilling i t s  contents Into information items ofinternst to him, and building a conceptual modelof the ln fo rmgt ion  conveyed by the meBsase," Inthe area  of miss i le  and sate l l i te  repor ts  anda i rc ra f t  ac t iv i t tu .

RELATION TO SOME OTHER SIE SYSTEMSThe problem chat we have had concerningthe safety factor is one chat is likely to befound in any $IE system, but i?
is soluble wefeel.
Even though we have not completed work onthis experimental system as of the time of writingthis paper (we have found more syntactic andsemantic procedures ro be implemented), we alreadyhave ideas as ?o how to build in a better safetyfactor.
Generally, these can be characterized asusing some of the information chat can be gleanedby a comblnat ion of llnguls tic and chemicalknowledge which we had ignored as redundant.While It is redundant in "successful" cases, itproduces conf l i c ts  tn other cases, ind icat ing  thatsomething is wrong, and that  the document shouldbe processed b?
hand.If the safety Eactor can be improved, SIEsystems offer a promising area of application ofcomputational  ?
