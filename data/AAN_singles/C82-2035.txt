SYNTACTIC PRIVILEGEMichael B. KaoDept.
of Linguistics, University o f~esota ,  Einneapolis,Minnesota 55455 USAThis paper i s  addressed to the view of  Schank and B i rn -baum (1981) that  syntax has no "pr iv i leged 'pos i t ion  in  pars -ing .
Ev ident ly  what i s  meant i s  (a)  that  syntact i c  pars inghas no logical or temporal priority over semantic processing,and (b) that  syntax has been as@igned attention far out ofproportion to its interest or distinctiveness.
(The latter isnot asserted outright, but seems implicit in the overall toneof the discussion.)
In the view of the authors (henceforth"SB'), syntactic considerations come into play in sentenceu~derstandi~E only where it is needed to resolve indeterminac-ies.
It is this view that I wish to subject to scrutiny.Part of the case for the position that syntacting pars-ing is not a prerequisite to semantic analysis lies ix~ thefact that there are sentences which can be understood withouta~y invocation of syntactic considerations at all.
Such acase is( 1 ) John ate lunch.since it is intrinsic to the concept of eating that it is anaction carried out by animate beings; thus, since only J=o~_~denotes such a being in (I), it denotes the actor, leavinglunch to be understood as denoting whatever was ingested.
Onthe other hand, since animate beings are themselves i~gestib-le, one would presumably have to invoke at least low-level- 150  -syntact i c  cues to  cor rect ly  parse(2)  The oanmiba ls  a te  the  Rev.
Dr. Abercrombie .It is possible, however, that SB would deny that syntax mustbe called even in this case since world knowledge might becapable of sorting out the roles.
One might suppose that thereis a script called ,~CANNI3AL which includes a soeDario in-volvi~E putting missionaries in pots of boiling water andthen eating them; assumil~ that there is no other world know-ledge to suF~eet that missionaries typically return the favor,then (2) can be parsed asyntaotically as well.
If this is so,however, then there is a problem with(3) The Rev.
Dr. Abercombie ate the cannibals.No speaker of ED~lish would interpret (3) as synonymous with(2); thus, even if (2) is parsed asyntactically, (3) couldnot  be.
But g iven  that  the  amount of  p r io r  semant ic  in fo rmat -ion  ( i .e .
ind iv idua l  word meanings)  i s  exact ly  the  same inboth  cases ,  how i s  a dec is ion  to  be made to  ca l l  the  syntaxin  the  case  of  (3) but  not  in  the  case  of  (2)?
Comparableprob lems w i l l  f requent ly  a~ise  w i th  f igurat ive  language;  so,fo r  example,(4)  The ta i l  wagged the  dog.i s  a way of  say ing  that  some expected  re la t ionsh ip  was revers -ed;  and yet  ~ i s  a good case  of  an asy~etr io  p red icate ,requ i r ing  that  one o f  i t s  arguments  re fer  to  a body par t  o rextens ion  thereof  ( such  as  a f lag)  wh i le  the  o ther  denote  anan imate  be ing  of  some k ind .
In  a case l i ke  (4 ) ,  there  i s  noindeterminacy  on pure ly  semant ic  grounds as  to  which NP shou lddenote  which,  but  the  resu l t  that  would ensue from process ing(4)  in  para l le l  fash ion  to(5)  The dog wagged h is  ta i l .i s ,  in  e f fec t ,  over ru led  by the  syntax .
I t  i s ,  indeed,  on lyfrom th is  over ru l ing  that  one would know that  one was dea l ing- 151  -with  f igurat ive  language.
Assuming that  (4) i s  parsed s rsntac -t ioa l l7  but not  (5) ,  we are then fo rced  onto the fo l low ingdilemma: syntax i s  ca l led  only where i t  i s  needed to over ru lethe consequences of  an asTntact i c  pa~se; but the cond i t ionsunder wh?ch such a ca l l  need be made themselves  depend on sTn-taottc~ in fo rmat ion  ( in  th i s  case word order  cues) ,  s ince  theword - leve l  semantic  in fo rmat ion  (a l l  e l se  that  i s  ava i lab le )cannot distinguish (4) from (5).What SB have done here::  i s  to  confuse redundancy andsuper f lu i ty .
Cases l i ke  (1) and (5) show that  syntax i s  some-t imes redundant ;  but  s ince  word - leve l  semsnt i~  does not  p ro -v ide  a way of  d is t J~ l&~Lsh i~ when i t  must be ca l led  and whenit need not  be, syntax  must be ca l led  ind isor imJ~te l~.
Wemight ca l l  th i s  the " fa i l - sa fe"  concept ion  o f  the in teract ionof  syntax  and semant ics .Nonethe less ,  SB might we l l  answer, there  i s  ev idencethat  human language users  ac tua l ly  do parse asyntaot i ca l l y .They c i te  the fac t  that  someone w i th  imper fec t  knowledge of  afo re ign  language may nonethe less  be ab le  to  read wr i t ten  ma-te r ia l s  in  the language,  us ing  noth i~ but word meaning andwor ld knowledge as a gu ide .
But wh i le  there  i s  no doubt thathuman be ings  are  capable  o f  doing th i s ,  i t  does not  fo l lowthat  th i s  i s  what they would do i f  they were not  fo rced  to?
Tosay that  one o f ten  doesn ' t  need a cer ta in  k ind o f  knowledge toCaZT7 OUt a g iven  task  does not  imply that  one ignores  i t  t fone has i t .I would l i ke  f ina l l7  to  ca l l  a t tent ion  to  a problem thati s  not  addressed a t  a l l  by SB, but which i s  a t  the very centero f  concern in  the des ign  o f  adequate natura l  language under -standing systems?
As SB present it, the problem of languageunderstanding comes down to that of ascertalnlng the meaningsof 11~u/stio expressions and then interrelatlng them in appro-priate w~.Ts.
No mention is made, however, of the problem ofknowlng what the expressions are to begin with.
How does one- 152  -know, for example, that Kreen aDDle is an expression denotingthe object of perception in (6a) but not in (6b)?
(6) a. John saw the ~reen apple.b.
John saw the green apple tree.Examples of this kind can be multiplied in many dlrections.Pot example, in(7) a. I watched John and Mary run to the police station.b.
I watched John and Mary ran to the police station.John and Mar~ is an expression denoting the performers of theact of running in (7a), but not in (To), The kinds of examplesdiscussed by 3B involve few multi-word constituents, and thosethat do arise seem to be of a kind that can be handled by rath-er local recognition meohanis~s; but cases like (7) show theneed in  some cases  to take g loba l  syntact i c  context  in toaccount as we l l .
The problems that  a r i se  in  th i s  regard  arenot  t r i v ia l ,  and as long as they ex is t ,  syntax w i l l  remain"Pr iv i leged"  a t  leas t  in  the sense that  i t  w i l l  make a majorc la im on the a t tent ion  of  some invest igators  and thus cont i -nue tO have a life of its own.Reference :Schank, R. and L.
