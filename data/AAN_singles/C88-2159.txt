Identifying Zero Pronouns in Japanese DialogueKei YOSHIMOTOA TR Interpreting Telephony Research LabsMID Tower Twin 2 I, 2-1-61 5hiromi Higashi-ku, Osaka 540, JapanAbstractJapanese dialogue containing zero pronouns is analyzedfor the purpose of automatic Japanese-English conver-sation translation.
Topic-driven Discourse Structure isformalized which identif ies mainly non-human zeropronouns as a by-product.
Other zero pronouns are handledus ing cognit ive and sociol inguist ic  informat ion inhonorific, deictic, speech-act and mental predicates.
Theseare integrated into the model.1.
IntroductionAn approach is proposed to automatical ly  analyzeJapanese dialogue containing zero pronouns, the mostfrequent type of anaphora which corresponds in fimction topersonal pronouns in English.
Zero pronoun is defined asan obligatory case noun phrase that is not expressed in theutterance but can be understood through other utterancesin the discourse, context, or out-of-context knowledge.Gaps identifiable by syntactico-semantic means, such asthose in relative clauses and a certain type of subordinateverb phrase, are excluded.
The input  discourse isconversation carried out in Japanese by typing at computerterminals, a type of conversation which has been proved tohave the thndamental characteristics ommon to telephoneconversation (Arita et al 1987).The key idea of the model is topic, something beingtalked about in the discourse.
This notion derives from thestudy of theme and theme by the Prague School (Firbas1966).
In the following, it is discussed that mainly non-human zero pronouns can be identified by means of topic,and, to do so, a discourse structure on the basis ofrecursively appearing topics is formalized.
Other zeropronouns, mainly human ones, are ident i f ied usingcognitive and sociolinguistie information conveyed byhonorific, deictic, and speech-act predicates as to how theomitted cases are related to the speaker or hearer.
The co-occurence restriction between subject and predicate thatexpresses a mental activity is also utilized.
Finally, theinteraction among these different factors in zero pronounidentification is discussed, and a model integrating them isproposed.
This is to constitute a part of a machinetranslation system being developed at the ATR which dealswith Japanese-Engl ish telephone and inter- terminaldialogue.2.
Zero prm~oun's role in discourseAn investigation of simulated Japanese inter-terminaldialogues (94 sentences, 2 dialogue sequences) and theirEnglish t~anslation has revealed that out of 53 occurrencesof personal pronouns in the English translat ion,  51correspond to zero pronouns in the original Japanese text.Though the size of the data is limited, this coincides wellwith our intuition about Japanese zero anaphora that itperforms discourse-grammatical functions including thoseplayed by personal pronouns in English (for a discussion tothe same effect, see Kameyama 1985).In the same Japanese dialogue data, out of 15 Zeropronouns coreferent with non-human antecedents, 14 referto one of the current opics in the discourse.
Out of 74 zeropronouns corresponding to the first and second persons, 55can be identified by means of cognitive and sociolinguisticinformation in honorific, deictic, speech-act, and mentalpredicates.
The other 19 examples were either set phrasesfor identifying the hearer, explaining one's intention, andresponding, etc., or cases understandable only in terms ofthe total context and situation.
Besides an approach basedon heuristic rules, the only possible solution to these wouldbe one with planning and/or script.
I will here concentrateon the major portion of zero anaphora cases that areidentifiable by topic continuity or predicate information asto honorificity, deixis, speech act, or mental activity.N.B.
Unlike italian, Spanish, etc., in Japanese predicatesgrammatical information such as person, gender and number is notindicated morphologically.
This is one of the reasons we mustemphasize pragmatic and discourse-grammatical factors inretrieving information referred to by zero anaphora.3.
Topic-based identification3.1.
PSG treatment of topic and zero pronounThe Japanese  topic has the fo l lowing  majorcharacteristics: (i) The topic is marked with a postpositionwa and usually, but not always, preposed.
(ii) More thanone topic can appear in a simple sentence.
(iii) With acertain type of subordinates, the subordinate predicate iscontrolled obligatorily by a topicalized matrix subject, butnot by an untopicalized one.
(iv) The topic represents whatis being talked about in the discourse.In the following an intrasentential treatment of (i) to(iii), a modified version of Yoshimoto (1987) is explained.It is based on Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar(HPSG) by Pollard & Sag (1987) and Japanese PhraseStructure Grammar (JPSG) by Gunji (1987).Topic is represented as a value in the TOPIC featurethat corresponds tothe semantics of topicalized NP(s).
TheTOPIC is a FOOT feature that derives from the lexicaldescription of wa.
To deal with multi-topic sentences, thevalue of TOPIC is a stack that enables embedding of topics.For the type of subordinate whose predicate is controlled bya topicalized matrix subject, the subordinate-head particle(to be more exact, ADV head) is g iven a featurespecification to the effect that the subordinate subjectunifies with a topicalized matrix subject, but not with anuntopicalized one.This topic description along with other parts of the779'fundamental grammar of Japanese was implemented on aunifica{ion-based parser built up by my colleagues KiyoshiKogure and Susumu Kat6 (Maeda et al 1988).The anlysis of (l-l-a) is given as (l-l-b).

Following JPSG, subcatego-rized-for NPs are assigned to the category P (therefore, tobe more exact, they are PPs), because all (at least written)Japanese case NPs are followed by postpositions.3.2.
Top ic -dr iven  d iscourse s t ructureBased on the intrasentential specification oftopicalizedsentences given in the previous ection, a discourse-leveltopic structure is formalized, with zero anaphora beingidentified at the same time.In (1), the zero pronoun "W' in A1-2 coincides withsightseeing tour, a topic in QI-1.
However, a naivealgorithm of finding the most recent opic fails because ofthe topics' recursive structure: the zero indirect object in780Q3-1 refers to the "higher" topic sightseeing tour in QI-1, notthe "lower" one hiy6 in Q2-1.

Syntactically, TDS iscomposed of the following single basic structure:(2) Co --" 01 ... On (n >= 1)The intrasentential analysis result of each sentence,except a multi-topic one, unifies with a C. ?Each C has afeature TOP that indicates a discourse-level topic value indistinction from TOPIC, an intrasentential topic feature.N.B.
A sentence with n topics unifies with an a-time deep verticaltree in which a single C is dominated by another.
The leaf node is aC whose TOP value is a stack with all the topics in the sentence,and each non-terminal node C has a TOP stack containing that ofthe immediately dominated C minus the first member.
Forexample, a sentence with three topics tl, t2, t8 (in order ofappearance) orresponds to the tree:C\[TOP <tl> \]ICETOP <tz, tl>\]IC\[TOP <t3, t2, tl>\]In (2), the value of the TOP of each of the C1 ..... Cn on theright-hand side is a concatenation f its TOPIC value andthe TOP value of the left-hand side C.<i TOP> = append(</ TOPIC>, <0 TOP>)(1 -< i<n)N.B.
The rule is stated in an extended version of PATR-II notation.
"< >" is used to denote a fqature structure path, and "=" to denotea token identity relation between two feature structures.Between the first value of the TOP of Co and that of Ci awhole-part relation holds.
This is stipulated by theknowledge base.The value of TOP of Ci is set as default o that of Ci_l:<i TOP> =d <i-1 TOP> (2 -< i -< n)%J i /El\[TOP <?tl sightseeing tour'7>\] C2\[TOP <?tl >\] C3\[TOP <?tl >\] C4\[TOP <?I1 >\] CT\[TOP <?tl >\](QI-I) (AI.0 (AI-2) .

If none of the pairs are unifiable, then therule does not apply.The analysis tree of discourse xample (1) is shown asFigure l.. Sentences QI-I, ALl, A1-2, and Q3-1 share thecommon topic .sightseeing tour, and Q2-1 and A2-1 sharehiy() (expense).
The latter is a subtopic of the tbrmer.There are two syntactic possibilities tbr Q3-1's location:it can be either in coordination with QI-I, At-I, and A1.2, orwith Q~.-I at)d A2-1.
Itere the former are chosen as itscoordinates because the knowledge base presents theinfbrmation ~hat Q3.1's predicate mdsihotnu (reserve) iscompatible vcith sightseeing tour, but not with hiy~(expense).
Note that, while discourse (1) is being analyzed,zero pronou~Js in At-2, A2-1, and Q3-1 are also identified.

)This topic-based approach is in contrast to Kameyama's,Japanese version (Kameyama 1985, Kameyama 1986) of"tbcus-based spproach to anaphora by Grosz et al 1983.
Inher framewock, subjecthood and predicate deixis play theprincipal role, and the fact that topic provides the mostimportant clue to anaphora identification i actual spokenJapanese discourse isnot utilized explicitly.,-L3~ Extension of topic introduct ionOne of the p~'ob\]ems with the topicobased approach isthat topics re?erred to by zero pronouns are not alwayse:~'pli('itiy marked by the topic postposition wa.
Sometimes,the NPs a*'e never fi)und in discourse in s~rictly the sametbr~.,.~s a they a,'c ~'ecovered.
To deal with all possible cases,ihrtt~er elaboration i  the inter-field omain of semantics,p~~t_~matic~, anddiscourse grammar is needed.
Here I willlimit my attentio,l to cases analyzable by extending the(:urn'eat method.First, a certain type of series of words whose function is,like wa, to introduce topics into the discourse, such as no h5ga, ni tuite desu ga, no ken desu l~,a, and no koto desu ga, arehandled in the same way as wa both syntactically anddiscourse-grammatically.Second, more complicated cases of topic introductionsentence patterns are also treated.

(He ...)As illustrated in (3), the sentence pattern <NP gaVEXISTENTIAL u/no desu ga> is employed to implicitlyintroduce the NP as a topic into the discourse.
To meetsuch cases, the lexical description of the topic-introductoryADV head ga is specified so that the SEM value of thesubject of the subcategorizcd-fbr existential verb unifieswith the (implicit) topic of the whole sentence.4.
Identif ication by means of predicate informat ion4.1.
Honorif ic predicateJapanese has a rich grammatical system of honorlfics.Among them, expressions related to the discussion here aresubject-honorific and object-honorific predicates.
Subject-honorific predicate is a form of predicate used to expressrespect o the person referred to by the subject of thepredicate.
Object-honorific predicate is used to expressrespect to the direct or indirect object of the predicate whosesubject.-agent is the speaker or his/her in-group member.In conversation, the omitted subject of subject-honorificpredicate is typically the hearer.
And, conversely, thesubject of this type of predicate is usually omitted whenreferring to the hearer, as in (4).
This is evidently in orderto avoid the redundancy, in case there is no one else worthpaying respect to, of the speaker being explicitly indicatedas subject while at the same time the subject identity isvirtually limited to the speaker by the predicate's honorificinformation.
Likewise, the direct or indirect object ofobject.-honorific predicates i typically the hearer and thesubject is typically the speaker, and the two NPs areusually omitted when this holds, as in example (5).

Tixe omitted subjectof (4) and the omitted indirect t)bjeet of (5) may be someoneelse worthy of respect, and the omitted subject of" (5) may bethe speaker's in-group member.
A mechanism is neededwhich identifies the omitted subject of the subject-honorificpredicate and the object of the object-honorific predicatewith the hearer, a~d the omitted subject of the object-honorific predicate with the speaker  by default ,  andotherwise (when specific information is given) identif iesthem with a person explicitly given in the context,.Lexical descriptions of honorific verbs and auxil iariezmust meet the condition above.
For example, the lexicaldescription of a subject-honorific auxi l iary reru is as follows(the feature specification depends on that for honorifics byMaeda et al 1988)(DEFI_EX re VSTEM ()\[\[HEAD \[\[POS V\]\[crYPE VOW(vowel-st,)m-type, i .e.

Tile feature structure of the verbal stem of the auxiliary isgiven above.
Conjugational endings are specified separately andare utilized in analyzing the auxiliary.
The CTYPE value in theSUBCAT specifics the conjugation type eI' the subcategorizcd V, i.e.consonant-stem-type and suru4ype (Vs with other conjugationtypes are subcategorized-for by rareru, an allomorph of reru).
TheMODL is used to impose conditions on the possibility of mutualsubcategorization between different ldnds of Vs.
In order to meetthe unorderedness of Japanese case phrases, the value of theSUBCAT feature is a set (Gunji 1987) instead of an ordered listadopted in the HPSG English gramrnar (Pollard & Sag 1987).
Theset is expressed by a rule reader into its cm'responding possibleordered list descriptions.The semantic value of the subject (?X) is restricted bythe PRAG feature (the feature for describing the pragznaticconstraint) to be someone being respected by the speaker.782/When it is not filled by the analy,(~is depend'e;~i~ on explicitinlbrmation, it deihult~ to the speaker by means of" == d".This lexical description is embedded into the total zeropronoun identification mechanism by revising TSIJ:l op ic  Supp lementat ion  Principle (2nd Version)1.

For object-honorific auxiliaries and verbs, empathy degree isalso specified.
Sec Sections 4.2. and 5.4.2.
Deictic predictsreOne of the major features of spoken Japanese discourseis its f requent use of" deict ic predicates,  i.e.
forms ofpredicates which change according to the empathic relatio~between tb.e persen~s involved.
The most easily understoodexamples are go and come in Engl ish.
Besides the i rcmmterparts iku and huru, Japanese has a trichotomoussystem of donatory verbs, inc. yaru (give), hureru (give), andmorau (receive).
Kurer~ is used when the receiver is Uhespeaker or his/her in-group member (e.g.
his/her ihm\[iy)oOtherwise yarn is used ~o express give.
These forras arealso employed as ao.~iliarics on the same deictic conditionwhen the action expressed by the main verb involves givingor receiving of laver.
They appear frequently in spokenJapanese dialogue as constituents of speech-act~relatedcomplex predicates.

There aretwo possibilities fbr this: (1) ?X1 is identified with the topicsyssyd (Prime Minister) according to the first rule of TSP.795(2) ?X2 is identified with syusyS.
Among these, only (2) canfill both ?X1 and ?X2.
That is, if ?X2 unifies with syusy5and ?X1 with ?SPEAKER (this is further to be set to ag loba l  var iab le  *ANSWERER*  at  the  d i scourserepresentation level) by the default rule deriving from thelexical description of i tadaku (see Sections 4.1 and 4.2).Here, there is nothing wrong with the PRAG features.On the other hand, if (1) is chosen and ?X1 is set tosyusyO and ?X2 unifies with ?HEARER as default (as isstipulated by the lexical description of i tadaku), then thePRAG has as one of its RESTRS members\[\[RELN EMPATHY-DEGREE\]\[MORE syusy6'\]\[LESS ?HEARER\]\]that  is not uni f iable with the fol lowing part  of theknowledge base\[\[RELN EMPATHY-DEGREE\]\[MORE ?HEARER"\[LESS syusy6'\]\].................................because of the st ipulation \[\[RELN EMPATHY-DEGREE\]\[MORE ?X\]\[LESS ?Y\]\] A \[\[RELN EMPATHY-DEGREE\]\[MORE ?Y\]\[LESS ?X\]\] =1..Likewise, the zero pronouns "~SBJ" in QI and "OSBJ" ofo-kosi i tadakemasen i  AI are identified with the speaker.The in tegrat ion  of the d i f fe rent  approaches  arei l lustrated in Figure 2.
The figure reflects the orderedrelation among the three components: what intrasententialsyntax cannot  d isambiguate  is handled by the topicstructure,  and then the rest  goes to the pred icateinibrmation component.N.B.
Anaphora identification (beth zero and explicit anaphora) ismade more effectively and widely if a model of objects appearing inthe discourse with their linguistically expressed and default PRAGfeatures is formalized.
This was partly done by Maeda et al 1988by means of Discourse Representation Theory.6.
ConclusionTDS (Topic-driven Discourse Structure), a Japanesedialogue discourse structure that resolves zero anaphorareference, was proposed on the basis of topic structure.Inlbrmation carried by predicates on honorificity, deixis,speech act and menta l  act iv i t ies  is also ut i l i zed  i~connection with TDS.
The method conforms well with theway zero anaphora actually functions in spoken Japanesediscourse.
Of the zero pronouns in the inter- terminalconversation data, 79.8% were cases identifiable by thisapproach.AcknowledgmentI would like to thank Dr. Akira K urematu, president ofATR Interpreting Telephony Research Labs, Dr. TeruakiA izawa,  head of Natura l  Language Unders tand ingDepartment, and my other colleagues for their encourage-ment and thought-provoking discussions.ReferenceArita, H. et al, 1987, "Media ni izonsuru kaiwa no ySsiki."
