We de-scribe the semantic tagging process and acorpus experiment.1 IntroductionBridging anaphora represents a special part of thegeneral problem of anaphor resolution.
As a spe-cial case of anaphora, it has been studied and dis-cussed by different authors and for various lan-guages.
There are many problems in develop-ing such studies.
First, bridging is not a regu-lar class, it seldom contains cases of associativeand indirect anaphora (defined in the sequence);lexical resources such as Wordnet are not avail-able for every language, and even when availablesuch resources have proven to be insufficient forthe problem.
In fact, different sources of lexi-cal knowledge have been evaluated for anaphoraresolution (Poesio et al, 2002; Markert and Nis-sim, 2005; Bunescu, 2003).
At last, corpus stud-ies of bridging anaphora usually report resultson a reduced number of examples, because thiskind of data is scarce.
Usually bridging anaphoraconsiders two types: Associative anaphors areNPs that have an antecedent that is necessaryto their interpretation (the relation between theanaphor and its antecedent is different from iden-tity); and Indirect anaphor are those that havean identity relation with their antecedents but theanaphor and its antecedent have different head-nouns.
In both associative and indirect anaphora,the semantic relation holding between the anaphorand its antecedent play an essential role for res-olution.
However, here we present an evalu-ation of the semantic tagging provided by thePortuguese parser PALAVRAS (Bick, 2000)(http://visl.sdu.dk/visl/pt/parsing/automatic) as alexical resource for indirect anaphora resolution.We focus on indirect anaphors for two reasons,they are greater in number and they present betteragreement features concerning human annotation.2 Semantic Annotation with PrototypeTagsAs a Constraint Grammar system, PALAVRASencodes all annotational information as wordbased tags.
A distinction is made between mor-phological, syntactic, valency and semantic tags,and for a given rule module (or level of analysis),one tag type will be regarded as primary (= flaggedfor disambiguation), while tags from lower lev-els provide unambiguous context, and tags fromhigher levels ambiguous lexical potentialities.Thus, semantic tags are regarded as secondaryhelp tags at the syntactic level, but will have un-dergone some disambiguation at the anaphora res-olution level.
The semantic noun classes wereconceived as distinctors rather than semantic de-finitions, the goal being on the one hand to cap-ture semantically motivated regularities and rela-tions in syntax, on the other hand to allow to dis-tinguish between different senses, or to chose dif-ferent translation equivalents in MT applications.A limited set of semantic prototype classes wasdeamed ideal for both purposes, since it allows atthe same time similarity-based lumping of words(useful in structural analysis, IR, anaphora reso-lution) and context based polysemy resolution foran individual word (useful in MT, lexicography,alignment).
Though we define class hypernymsas prototypes in the Roschian sense (Rosch, 1978)76as an (idealized) best instance of a given class ofentities, we avoided low level prototypes, using<Azo> for four-legged land-animals rather than<dog> and <cat> for dog and cat races etc.
).Where possible, systematic sub-classes were es-tablished.
Semiotic artifacts <sem>, for instanceare sub-divided into ?readables?
<sem-r> (book-prototype: book, paper, magazine), ?watchables?<sem-w> (film, show, spectacle), ?listenables?etc.
The final category inventory, though devel-oped independently, resembles the ontology usedin the multilingual European SIMPLE project(http://www.ub.es/ gilcub/SIMPLE/simple.html).For the sake of rule based inheritance reasoning,semantic prototype classes were bundled using amatrix of 16 atomic semantic features.
Thus,the atomic feature +MOVE is shared by the dif-ferent human and animal prototypes as well asthe vehicle prototype, but the vehicle prototypelacks the +ANIM feature, and only the bun-dle on human prototypes (<Hprof>, <Hfam>,<Hideo>,...) shares the +HUM feature (humanprofessional, human family, human follower of atheory/belief/conviction/ideology).
In the parser,a rule selecting the +MOVE feature (e.g.
for sub-jects of movement verbs) will help discard com-peting senses from lemmas with the above proto-types, since they will all inherit choices based onthe shared atomic feature.
Furthermore, atomicfeatures can themselves be subjected to inheri-tance rules, e.g.
+HUM ?> +ANIM ?> +CON-CRETE, or +MOVE?> +MOVABLE.
In Table 1,which contains examples of polysemic institutionnouns, positive features are marked with capitalletters, negative features with small letters1.
Thewords in the Table 1 are ambiguous with regardto the feature H, and since it is only the <inst>prototype that contributes the +HUM feature po-tential, it can be singled out by a rule selecting?H?
or by discarding ?h?.
The parser?s about 140prototypes have been manually implemented for alexicon of about 35.000 nouns.
In addition, the?HUM category was also introduced as a selec-tion restriction for 2.000 verb senses (subject re-striction) and 1.300 adjective senses (head restric-tion).While the semantic annotation of commonnouns is carried out by disambiguating a givenlemma?s lexicon-listed prototype potential, thisstrategy is not sufficient for proper nouns, due1furn=furniture, con=container, inst=institutionEe = entities (?CONCRETE)Jj = ?MOVABLEHh = ?HUMAN ENTITYMm = ?MASLl = ?LOCATIONpolysemy spectrumEe j Hh m Ll faculdadeE H L <inst> univ.

Intwo recent NER projects, the parser was aug-mented with a pattern recognition module and arule-based module for identifying and classify-ing names.
In the first project (Bick, 2003),6 main classes with about 15 subclasses wereused in a lexeme-based approach, while thesecond adopted the 41 largely functional cate-gories of Linguateca?s joint HAREM evaluationin 2005 (http://www.linguateca.com).
A lexicon-registered name like Berlin would have a stabletag (<civ> = civitas) in the first version, whileit would be tagged as either <hum>, <top> or<org> in the second, dependent on context.
Atthe time of writing, we have not yet tagged ouranaphora corpus with name type tags, and it isunclear which approach, lexematic or functional,will work best for the resolution of indirect andassociative anaphora.3 Indirect Anaphora ResolutionOur work was based on a corpus formed by 31newspaper articles, from Folha de Sa?o Paulo, writ-ten in Brazilian Portuguese.
The corpus was au-tomatically parsed using the parser PALAVRAS,and manually annotated for anaphoricity usingthe MMAX tool(http://mmax.eml-research.de/) .Four subjects annotated the corpus.
All annota-tors agreed on the antecedent in 73% of the cases,in other 22% of the cases there was agreement be-tween three annotators and in 5% of the cases onlytwo annotators agreed.
There were 133 cases of77definite Indirect anaphors (NPs starting with def-inite articles) from the total of 1454 definite de-scriptions (near to 10%) and 2267 NPs.The parser gives to each noun of the text (or tomost of them) a semantic tag.
For instance, thenoun japone?s [japanese] has the following seman-tic tags ling and Hnat, representing the features:human nationality and language respectively.<word id="word_28"><n can="japone?s" gender="M" number="S"><secondary_n tag="Hnat"/><secondary_n tag="ling"/></n></word>The approach consists in finding relationshipswith previous nouns through the semantic tags.The chosen antecedent will be the nearest expres-sion with the largest number of equal semantictags.
For instance, in the example below, theanaphor is resolved by applying this resolutionprinciple, to japone?s - a l?
?ngua.O Eurocenter oferece cursos de japone?s em Kanazawa.Apo?s um me?s, o aluno falara?
modestamente a l?
?ngua.The Eurocenter offers Japanese courses in Kanazawa.
Af-ter one month, a student can modestly speak the language.As both expressions (japanese and language)hold the semantic tag ?ling?
the anaphor is re-solved.
For the experiments, we considered as cor-rect the cases where the antecedent found automat-ically was the same as in the manual annotation(same), and also the cases in which the antecedentof the manual annotation was found further up inthe chain identified automatically (in-chain).
Wealso counted those cases in which the antecedentof the manual annotation was among the group ofcandidates sharing the same tags (in-candidates),but was not the chosen one (the chosen being thenearest with greater number of equal tags).Indirect anaphoraResults # % of TotalSame 25 19%In-chain 15 11%Total Correct 40 30%In-candidates 9 7%Unsolved 40 30%Error 44 33%Total 133 100%Table 2: Indirect anaphor resolutionTable 2 shows the results of the indirect anaphorresolution.
In 19% of the cases, the system foundthe same antecedent as marked in the manual an-notation.
Considering the chain identified by thesystem the correct cases go up to 30%.
The greatnumber of unsolved cases were related to the factthat proper names were not tagged.
Consideringmainly the tagged nouns (about 93 cases), the cor-rect cases amount to 43%).
This gives us an ideaof the quality of the tags for the task.
We furthertested if increasing the weight of more specificfeatures in opposition to the more general oneswould help in the antecedent decision process.
Asemantic tag that is more specific receives a higherweight The semantic tag set has three levels, level1, which is more general receives weight 1, level 2receives 5, and level 3 receives 10.
See the exam-ple below.<A> 1 Animal, umbrella tag<AA> 5 Group of animals<Adom> 10 Domestic animalIn this experiment the chosen candidate is thenearest one whose sum of equal tag values hashigher weight.
Table 3 shows just a small im-provement in the correct cases.
If we do notconsider unsolved cases, mostly related to propernames, indirect anaphors were correctly identifiedin 46% of the cases (43/96).Indirect anaphoraResults # % of TotalSame 24 18%In-chain 19 14%Total Correct 43 32%In-candidates 6 5%Unsolved 40 30%Error 44 33%Total 133 100%Table 3: Indirect anaphor - weighting schemaSince there is no semantic tagging for propernames as yet, the relationship between pairs suchas Sa?o Carlos - a cidade [Sa?o Carlos - the city]could not be found.
Regarding wrong antecedents,we have seen that some semantic relationships areweaker, having no semantic tags in common, forinstance: a proposta - o aumento [the proposal -the rise].
In some cases the antecedent is not aprevious noun phrase but a whole sentence, para-graph or disjoint parts of the text.
As we con-sider only relations holding between noun phrases,these cases could not be resolved.
Finally, thereare cases of plain heuristic failure.
For instance,establishing a relationship between os professores78[the teachers], with the semantic tags H and Hprof,and os politicos [the politicians], with the seman-tic tags H and Hprof, when the correct antecedentwas os docentes [the docents], with the semantictags HH (group of humans) and Hprof.4 Final RemarksPrevious work on nominal anaphor resolution hasused lexical knowledge in different ways.
(Poe-sio et al, 1997) presented results concerning theresolution of bridging definitions, using the Word-Net (Fellbaum, 1998), where bridging DDs en-close our Indirect and Associative anaphora.
Poe-sio et al reported 35% of recall for synonymy,56% for hypernymy and 38% for meronymy.
(Schulte im Walde, 1997) evaluated the bridg-ing cases presented in (Poesio et al, 1997), onthe basis of lexical acquisition from the BritishNational Corpus.
She reported a recall of 33%for synonymy, 15% for hypernymy and 18% formeronymy.
(Poesio et al, 2002) considering syn-tactic patterns for lexical knowledge acquisition,obtained better results for resolving meronymy(66% of recall).
(Gasperin and Vieira, 2004)tested the use of word similarity lists on resolv-ing indirect anaphora, reporting 33% of recall.
(Markert and Nissim, 2005) presented two ways(WordNet and Web) of obtaining lexical knowl-edge for antecedent selection in coreferent DDs(Direct and Indirect anaphora).
Markert andNissim achieved 71% of recall using Web-basedmethod and 65% of recall using WordNet-basedmethod.
We can say that our results are very sat-isfactory, considering the related work.
Note thatusually evaluation of bridging anaphora is madeon the basis of a limited number of cases, becausethe data is sparse.
Our study was based on 133examples, which is not much but surpasses someof the previous related work.
Mainly, our resultsindicate that the semantic tagging provided by theparser is a good resource for dealing with the prob-lem, if compared to other lexical resources such asWordNet and acquired similarity lists.
We believethat the results will improve significantly once se-mantic tags for proper names are provided by theparser.
