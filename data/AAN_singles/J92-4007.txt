A Problem for RST: The Need forMulti-Level Discourse AnalysisJ ohanna D. Moore*University of PittsburghMar tha  E. Po l lack*University of PittsburghRhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1987), argues that in mostcoherent discourse, consecutive discourse lements are related by a small set of rhetor-ical relations.
Moreover, RST suggests that the information conveyed in a discourseover and above what is conveyed in its component clauses can be derived from therhetorical relation-based structure of the discourse.
A large number of natural lan-guage generation systems rely on the rhetorical relations defined in RST to imposestructure on multi-sentential text (Hovy 1991; Knott 1991; Moore and Paris 1989; Ros-ner and Stede 1992).
In addition, many descriptive studies of discourse have employedRST (Fox 1987; Linden, Cumming, and Martin 1992; Matthiessen and Thompson 1988).However, recent work by Moore and Paris (1992) noted that RST cannot be used asthe sole means of controlling discourse structure in an interactive dialogue system, be-cause RST representations provide insufficient information to support the generationof appropriate responses to "follow-up questions."
The basic problem is that an RSTrepresentation f a discourse does not fully specify the intentional structure (Grosz andSidner 1986) of that discourse.
Intentional structure is crucial for responding effectivelyto questions that address a previous utterance: without a record of what an utterancewas intended to achieve, it is impossible to elaborate or clarify that utterance.
1Further consideration has led us to conclude that the difficulty observed by Mooreand Paris stems from a more fundamental problem with RST analyses.
RST presumesthat, in general, there will be a single, preferred rhetorical relation holding betweenconsecutive discourse lements.
In fact, as has been noted in other work on discoursestructure (Grosz and Sidner 1986), discourse elements are related simultaneously onmultiple levels.
In this paper, we focus on two levels of analysis.
The first involves therelation between the information conveyed in consecutive elements of a coherent dis-course.
Thus, for example, one utterance may describe an event that can be presumedto be the cause of another event described in the subsequent utterance.
This causal re-lation is at what we will call the informational level.
The second level of relation resultsfrom the fact that discourses are produced to effect changes in the mental state of thediscourse participants.
In coherent discourse, a speaker is carrying out a consistentplan to achieve the intended changes, and consecutive discourse lements are relatedto one another by means of the ways in which they participate in that plan.
Thus,one utterance may be intended to increase the likelihood that the hearer will come to* Department ofComputer Science and Intelligent Systems Program, University of Pittsburgh,Pittsburgh, PA 15260. e-mail: jmoore,pollack@cs.pitt.edu1 In addition, intentional structure isneeded to make certain types of choices during the generationprocess, e.g., how to refer to an object (Appelt 1985).
@ 1992 Association for Computational LinguisticsComputational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4believe the subsequent u terance: we might say that the first utterance is intended toprovide evidence for the second.
Such an evidence relation is at what we will call theintentional level.RST acknowledge s that there are two types of relations between discourse le-ments, distinguishing between subject matter and presentational relations.
According toMann and Thompson, "\[s\]ubject matter elations are those whose intended effect is thatthe \[hearer\] ecognize the relation in question; presentational re ations are those whoseintended effect is to increase some inclination in the \[hearer\]" (Mann and Thompson1987, p. 18).
2 Thus, subject matter elations are informational; presentational relationsare intentional.
However, RST analyses presume that, for any two consecutive le-ments of a coherent discourse, one rhetorical relation will be primary.
This means thatin an RST analysis of a discourse, consecutive elements will either be related by aninformational or an intentional relation.In this paper, we argue that a complete computational model of discourse structurecannot depend upon analyses in which the informational nd intentional levels ofrelation are in competition.
Rather, it is essential that a discourse model include bothlevels of analysis.
We show that the assumption of a single rhetorical relation betweenconsecutive discourse lements i one of the reasons that RST analyses are inherentlyambiguous.
3 We also show that this same assumption underlies the problem observedby Moore and Paris.
Finally, we point out that a straightforward approach to revisingRST by modifying the definitions of the subject matter elations to indicate associatedpresentational analyses (or vice versa) cannot succeed.
Such an approach presumes aone-to-one mapping between the ways in which information can be related and theways in which intentions combine into a coherent plan to affect a hearer's mentalstate--and no such mapping exists.
We thus conclude that in RST, and, indeed, in anyviable theory of discourse structure, analyses at the informational nd the intentionallevels must coexist.To illustrate the problem, consider the following example.An ExampleExample 1(a) George Bush supports big business.
(b) He's sure to veto House Bill 1711.A plausible RST analysis of (1) is that there is an EVIDENCE relation betweenutterance (b), the nucleus of the relation, and utterance (a), the satellite.
This analysisis licensed by the definition of this relation (Mann and Thompson 1987, p. 10):Relat ion name: EVIDENCEConstraints on Nucleus:  H might not believe Nucleus to a degreesatisfactory to S.Constraints on Satellite: H believes Satellite or will find it credible.2 Mann and Thompson analyzed primarily written texts, and so speak of the "writer" and "reader."
Forconsistency with much of the rest of the literature on discourse structure, we use the terms "speaker"and "hearer" in this paper, but nothing in our argument depends on this fact.3 It is not the only reason for ambiguity in RST analyses, but it is the only one we will comment on inthis paper.
Another well-known problem involves the underspecificity of the rhetorical relationdefinitions.538Johanna D. Moore and Martha E. Pollack A Problem for RSTConstra ints  on  Nuc leus  + Satel l i te combinat ion:  H's comprehendingSatellite increases H's belief of Nucleus.Effect: H's belief of Nucleus is increased.However, an equally plausible analysis of this discourse is that utterance (b) isthe nucleus of a VOLITIONAL CAUSE relation, as licensed by the definition (Mann andThompson 1987, p. 58):Relat ion name:  VOLITIONAL-CAUSEConstra ints  on Nuc leus:  presents a volitional action or else a situationthat could have arisen from a volitional action.Constra ints  on Satel l i te: none.Constra ints  on Nuc leus  + Satel l i te combinat ion:  Satellite presents asituation that could have caused the agent of the volitional action inNucleus to perform that action; without he presentation of Satellite, Hmight not regard the action as motivated or know the particularmotivation; Nucleus is more central to S's purposes in putting forth theNucleus-Satellite combination than Satellite is.Effect: H recognizes the situation presented in Satellite as a cause for thevolitional action presented in Nucleus.It seems clear that Example I satisfies both the definition of EVIDENCE, a presenta-tional relation, and VOLITIONAL CAUSE, a subject matter elation.
In their formulationof RST, Mann and Thompson ote that potential ambiguities such as this can arise inRST, but they argue that one analysis will be preferred, depending on the intent hatthe analyst ascribes to the speaker:Imagine that a satellite provides evidence for a particular proposi-tion expressed in its nucleus, and happens to do so by citing an at-tribute of some element expressed in the nucleus.
Then.
.
.
the condi-tions for both EVIDENCE and ELABORATION are fulfilled.
If the ana-lyst sees the speaker's purpose as increasing the hearer's belief of thenuclear propositions, and not as getting the hearer to recognize theob jec t :a t t r ibute  r lationship, then the only analysis is the one withthe EVIDENCE relation (Mann and Thompson 1987, p. 30, emphasisours).This argument is problematic.
The purpose of all discourse is, ultimately, to affecta change in the mental state of the hearer.
Even if a speaker aims to get a hearer torecognize some object :a t t r ibute  relationship, she has some underlying intention fordoing that: she wants to enable the hearer to perform some action, or to increase thehearer's belief in some proposition, etc.
Taken seriously, Mann and Thompson's strat-egy for dealing with potential ambiguities between presentational (i.e., intentional) andsubject matter (i.e., informational) relations would result in analyses that contain onlypresentational relations, since these are what most directly express the speaker's pur-pose.
But, as we argue below, a complete model of discourse structure must maintainboth levels of relation.539Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 42.
The Argument from InterpretationWe begin by showing that in discourse interpretation, recognition may flow from theinformational level to the intentional level or vice versa.
In other words, a hearer maybe able to determine what the speaker is trying to do because of what the hearerknows about the world or what she knows about what the speaker believes about theworld.
Alternatively, the hearer may be able to figure out what the speaker believesabout the world by recognizing what the speaker is trying to do in the discourse.
Thispoint has previously been made by Grosz and Sidner (1986, pp.
188-190).
4Returning to our initial exampleExample 1(a) George Bush supports big business.
(b) He's sure to veto House Bill 1711.suppose that the hearer knows that House Bill 1711 places stringent environmentalcontrols on manufacturing processes,  From this she can infer that supporting bigbusiness will cause one to oppose this bill.
Then, because she knows that one wayfor the speaker to increase a hearer's belief in a proposition is to describe a plausiblecause of that proposition, she can conclude that (a) is intended to increase her beliefin (b), i.e., (a) is evidence for (b).
The hearer easons from informational coherence tointentional coherence.Alternatively, suppose that the hearer has no idea what House Bill 1711 legislates.However, she is in a conversational situation in which she expects the speaker tosupport the claim that Bush will veto it.
For instance, the speaker and hearer arearguing and the hearer has asserted that Bush will not veto any additional bills beforethe next election.
Again using the knowledge that one way for the speaker to increaseher belief in a proposition is to describe a plausible cause of that proposition, thehearer in this case can conclude that House Bill 1711 must be something that a bigbusiness supporter would oppose-- in  other words that (a) may be a cause of (b).Here the reasoning is from intentional coherence to informational coherence.
Notethat this situation illustrates how a discourse can convey more than the sum of itsparts.
The speaker not only conveys the propositional content of (a) and (b), but alsothe implication relation between (a) and (b): supporting big business entails oppositionto House Bill 1711.
6It is clear from this example that any interpretation system must be capable ofrecognizing both intentional and informational relations between discourse lements,and must be able to use relations recognized at either level to facilitate recognitionat the other level.
We are not claiming that interpretation always depends on therecognition of relations at both levels, but rather that there are obvious cases whereit does.
An interpretation system therefore needs the capability of maintaining bothlevels of relation.4 In Grosz and Sidner (1986), dominates and satisfaction-precedence are the intentional relations, whilesupports and generates are the informational relations.5 The hearer also needs to believe that it is plausible the speaker holds the same belief; (see Konoligeand Pollack 1989).6 This is thus an example of what Sadock calls modus brevis (Sadock 1977).540Johanna D. Moore and Martha E. Pollack A Problem for RST3.
The Argument from GenerationIt is also crucial that a generation system have access to both the intentional andinformational relations underlying the discourses it produces.
For example, considerthe following discourse:S:H:(a) Come home by 5:00.
(b) Then we can go to the hardware store beforeit closes.
(c) We don't need to go to the hardware store.
(d) I borrowed a saw fromJane.At the informational level, (a) specifies a CONDITION for doing (b): getting to thehardware store before it closes depends on H's coming home by 5:00.
7 How should Srespond when H indicates in (c) and (d) that it is not necessary to go to the hardwarestore?
This depends on what S's intentions are in uttering (a) and (b).
In uttering (a),S may be trying to increase H's ability to perform the act described in (b): S believesthat H does not realize that the hardware store closes early tonight.
In this case, S mayrespond to H by saying:S: (e) OK, I'll see you at the usual time then.On the other hand, in (a) and (b), S may be trying to motivate H to come homeearly, say because S is planning a surprise party for H. Then she may respond to Hwith something like the following:S: (f) Come home by 5:00 anyway.
(g) Or else you'll get caught in the stormthat's moving in.What this example illustrates is that a generation system cannot rely only oninformational level analyses of the discourse it produces.
This is precisely the pointthat Moore and Paris have noted (1992).
If the generation system is playing the roleof S, then it needs a record of the intentions underlying utterances (a) and (b) in orderto determine how to respond to (c) and (d).
Of course, if the system can recover theintentional relations from the informational ones, then it will suffice for the systemto record only the latter.
However, as Moore and Paris have argued, such recoveryis not possible because there is not a one-to-one mapping between intentional andinformational relations.The current example illustrates this last point.
At the informational level, utterance(a) is a CONDITION for (b), but on one reading of the discourse there is an ENABLEMENTrelation at the intentional level between (a) and (b), while on another eading there isa MOTIVATION relation.
Moreover, the nucleus/satellite structure of the informationallevel relation is maintained only on one of these readings.
Utterance (b) is the nucleusof the CONDITION relation, and, similarly, it is the nucleus of the ENABLEMENT relationon the first reading.
However, on the second reading, it is utterance (a) that is thenucleus of the MOTIVATION relation.7 See Mann and Thompson (1987) for definitions ofthe RST relations used throughout this example.541Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4Just as one cannot always recover intentional relations from informational ones,neither can one always recover informational relations from intentional ones.
In thesecond reading of the current example, the intentional level MOTIVATION relation isrealized first with a CONDITION relation between (a) and (b), and, later, with an OTH-ERWISE relation in (f) and (g).4.
DiscussionWe have illustrated that natural anguage interpretation and natural anguage genera-tion require discourse models that include both the informational and the intentionalrelations between consecutive discourse lements.
RST includes relations of both types,but commits to discourse analyses in which a single relation holds between each pairof elements.One might imagine modifying RST to include multi-relation definitions, i.e., def-initions that ascribe both an intentional and an informational relation to consecutivediscourse lements.
Such an approach was suggested by Hovy (1991), who augmentedrhetorical relation definitions to include a "results" field.
Although Hovy did notcleanly separate intentional from informational level relations, a version of his ap-proach might be developed in which definitions are given only for informational (or,alternatively, intentional) level relations, and the results field of each definition is usedto specify an associated intentional (informational) relation.
However, this approachcannot succeed, for several reasons.First, as we have argued, there is not a fixed, one-to-one mapping between inten-tional and informational level relations.
We showed, for example, that a CONDITIONrelation may hold at the informational level between consecutive discourse lementsat the same time as either an ENABLEMENT or a MOTIVATION relation holds at theintentional level.
Similarly, we illustrated that either a CONDITION or an OTHERWISErelation may hold at the informational level at the same time as a MOTIVATIONALrelation holds at the intentional level.Thus, an approach such as Hovy's that is based on multi-relation definitions willresult in a proliferation of definitions.
Indeed, there will be potentially n x m relationscreated from a theory that initially includes n informational relations and m intentionalrelations.
Moreover, by combining informational and intentional relations into singledefinitions, one makes it difficult to perform the discourse analysis in a modularfashion.
As we showed earlier, it is sometimes useful first to recognize a relation atone level, and to use this relation in recognizing the discourse relation at the otherlevel.In addition, the multi-relation definition approach faces an even more severe chal-lenge.
In some discourses, the intentional structure is not merely a relabeling of theinformational structure.
A simple extension of our previous example illustrates thepoint:S: (a) Come home by 5:00.
(b) Then we can go to the hardware store beforeit closes.
(c) That way we can finish the bookshelves tonight.A plausible intentional level analysis of this discourse, which follows the secondreading we gave earlier, is that finishing the bookshelves (c) motivates going to thehardware store (b), and that (c) and (b) together motivate coming home by 5:00 (a).Coming home by 5:00 is the nucleus of the entire discourse: it is the action that S542Johanna D. Moore and Martha E. Pollack A Problem for RSTwishes H to perform (recall that S is planning a surprise party for H).
This structureis illustrated below:motivationmotivationb cAt the informational level, this discourse has a different structure.
Finishing thebookshelves i  the nuclear proposition.
Coming home by 5:00 (a) is a condition ongoing to the hardware store (b), and together these are a condition on finishing thebookshelves (c):conditionacThe intentional and informational structures for this discourse are not isomorphic.Thus, they cannot be produced simultaneously by the application of multiple-relationdefinitions that assign two labels to consecutive discourse lements.
The most obvious"fix" to RST will not work.
RST's failure to adequately support multiple levels of anal-ysis is a serious problem for the theory, both from a computational nd a descriptivepoint of view.AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to Barbara Grosz, KathyMcCoy, C6cile Paris, Donia Scott, KarenSparck Jones, and an anonymous reviewerfor their comments on this research.Johanna Moore's work on this project isbeing supported by grants from the Officeof Naval Research Cognitive and NeuralSciences Division and the National ScienceFoundation.ReferencesAppelt, Douglas E.
