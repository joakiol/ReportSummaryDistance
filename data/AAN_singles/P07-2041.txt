The adoptedlinking methodology, the software tooldevised and implemented for this purposeand the results of the first mapping phaseregarding 1stOrderEntities are illustratedhere.1 IntroductionThe mapping and the integration of lexicalresources is today a main concern in the world ofcomputational linguistics.
In fact, during the pastyears, many linguistic resources were built whosebulk of linguistic information is often neither easilyaccessible nor entirely available, whereas theirvisibility and interoperability would be crucial forHLT applications.The resources here considered constitute thelargest and extensively encoded Italian lexicalsemantic databases.
Both were built at the CNRInstitute of Computational Linguistics, in Pisa.The ItalWordNet lexical database (henceforthIWN) was first developed in the framework ofEuroWordNet project and then enlarged andimproved in the national project SI-TAL1.
Thetheoretical model underlying this lexicon is basedon the EuroWordNet lexical model (Vossen, 1998)which is, in its turn, inspired to the PrincetonWordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).PAROLE-SIMPLE-CLIPS (PSC) is a four-levellexicon developed over three different projects: the1 Integrated System for the Automatic Language Treatment.LE-PAROLE project for the morphological andsyntactic layers, the LE-SIMPLE project for thesemantic model and lexicon and the Italian projectCLIPS2 for the phonological level and theextension of the lexical coverage.
The theoreticalmodel underlying this lexicon is based on theEAGLES recommendations, on the results of theEWN and ACQUILEX projects and on a revisedversion of Pustejovsky?s Generative Lexicontheory (Pustejovsky 1995).In spite of the different underlying principles andpeculiarities characterizing the two lexical models,IWN and PSC lexicons also present manycompatible aspects and the reciprocalenhancements that the linking of the resourceswould entail were illustrated in Roventini et al,(2002); Ruimy & Roventini (2005).
This hasprompted us to envisage the semi-automatic link ofthe two lexical databases, eventually merging thewhole information into a common representationframework.
The first step has been the mapping ofthe 1stOrderEntities which is described in thefollowing.This paper is organized as follows: in section 2the respective ontologies and their mapping arebriefly illustrated, in section 3 the methodologyfollowed to link these resources is described; insection 4 the software tool and its workings areexplained; section 5 reports on the results of thecomplete mapping of the 1stOrderEntities.
Futurework is outlined in the conclusion.2 Mapping Ontology-based Lexical ResourcesIn both lexicons, the backbone for lexicalrepresentation is provided by an ontology ofsemantic types.2 Corpora e Lessici dell'Italiano Parlato e Scritto.161The IWN Top Ontology (TO) (Roventini et al,2003), which slightly differs from the EWN TO3,consists in a hierarchical structure of 65 language-independent Top Concepts (henceforth TCs)clustered in three categories distinguishing 1stOrderEntities, 2ndOrderEntities and 3rdOrderEntities.
Their subclasses, hierarchically ordered bymeans of a subsumption relation, are alsostructured in terms of (disjunctive and non-disjunctive) opposition relations.
The IWNdatabase is organized around the notion of synset,i.e.
a set of synonyms.
Each synset is ontologicallyclassified on the basis of its hyperonym andconnected to other synsets by means of a rich set oflexical-semantic relations.
Synsets are in mostcases cross-classified in terms of multiple, nondisjoint TCs, e.g.
: informatica (computer science):[Agentive, Purpose, Social, Unboundedevent].
Thesemantics of a word sense or synset variant is fullydefined by its membership in a synset.The SIMPLE Ontology (SO)4, which consists of157 language-independent semantic types, is amultidimensional type system based onhierarchical and non-hierarchical conceptualrelations.
In the type system, multidimensionality iscaptured by qualia roles that define the distinctiveproperties of semantic types and differentiate theirinternal semantic constituency.
The SOdistinguishes therefore between simple (one-dimensional) and unified (multi-dimensional)semantic types, the latter implementing theprinciple of orthogonal inheritance.
In the PSClexicon, the basic unit is the word sense,represented by a ?semantic unit?
(henceforth,SemU).
Each SemU is assigned one single semantictype (e.g.
: informatica: [Domain]), which endowsit with a structured set of semantic information.A primary phase in the process of mapping twoontology-based lexical resources clearly consistedin establishing correspondences between theconceptual classes of both ontologies, with a viewto further matching their respective instances.The mapping will only be briefly outlined herefor the 1stOrderEntity.
More information can befound in (Ruimy & Roventini 2005; Ruimy, 2006).The IWN 1stOrderEntity class structuresconcrete entities (referred to by concrete nouns).
Itsmain cross-classifying subclasses: Form, Origin,3 A few changes were in fact necessary to allow the encodingof new syntactic categories.4 http://www.ilc.cnr.it/clips/Ontology.htmComposition and Function correspond to the fourQualia roles the SIMPLE model avails of toexpress orthogonal aspects of word meaning.
Theirrespective subdivisions consist of (mainly) disjointclasses, e.g.
Natural vs. Artifact.
To each classcorresponds, in most of the cases, a SIMPLEsemantic type or a type hierarchy subsumed by theConcrete_entity top type.
Some other IWN TCs,such as Comestible, Liquid, are instead mappableto SIMPLE distinctive features: e.g.
Plus_Edible,Plus_Liquid, etc.3 Linking MethodologyMapping is performed on a semantic type-drivenbasis.
A semantic type of the SIMPLE ontology istaken as starting point.
Considering the type?sSemUs along with their PoS and ?isa?
relation, theIWN resource is explored in search of linkingcandidates with same PoS and whose ontologicalclassification matches the correspondences establishedbetween the classes of both ontologies.A characteristic of this linking is that it involveslexical elements having a different status, i.e.semantic units and synsets.During the linking process, two different typesof data are returned from each mapping run:1) A set of matched pairs of word senses, i.e.SemUs and synset variants with identical string,PoS and whose respective ontological classificationperfectly matches.
After human validation, thesematched word senses are linked.2) A set of unmatched word senses, in spite of theiridentical string and PoS value.
Matching failure isdue to a mismatch of the ontological classificationof word senses existing in both resources.
Suchmismatch may be originated by:a) an incomplete ontological information.
Asalready explained, IWN synsets are cross-classifiedin terms of a combination of TCs; however, casesof synsets lacking some meaning component arenot rare.
The problem of incomplete ontologicalclassification may often be overcome by relaxingthe mapping constraints; yet, this solution can onlybe applied if the existing ontological label isinformative enough.
Far more problematic to dealwith are those cases of incomplete or littleinformative ontological labels, e.g.
1stOrderEntitiesas different as medicinale, anello, vetrata(medicine, ring, picture window) and onlyclassified as ?Function?
;162b) a different ontological information.
Besidesmere encoding errors, ontological classificationdiscrepancy may be imputable to:i) a different but equally defensible meaninginterpretation (e.g.
: ala (aircraft wing) : [Part] vs.[Artifact Instrument Object]).
Word senses fallinginto this category are clustered into numericallysignificant sets according to their semantic typingand then studied with a view to establishing furtherequivalences between ontological classes or toidentify, in their classification schemes, descriptiveelements lending themselves to be mapped.ii) a different level of specificity in theontological classification, due either to thelexicographer?s subjectivity or to an objectivedifference of granularity of the ontologies.The problems in ii) may be bypassed byclimbing up the ontological hierarchy, identifyingthe parent nodes and allowing them to be taken intoaccount in the mapping process.Hyperonyms of matching candidates are takeninto account during the linking process and play aparticularly determinant role in the resolution ofcases whereby matching fails due to a conflict ofontological classification.
It is the case for sets ofword senses displaying a different ontologicalclassification but sharing the same hyperonym, e.g.collana, braccialetto (necklace, bracelet) typed as[Clothing] in PSC and as [Artifact Function] inIWN but sharing the hyperonym gioiello (jewel).Hyperonyms are also crucial for polysemous sensesbelonging to different semantic types in PSC butsharing the same ontological classification in IWN,e.g.
: SemU1595viola (violet) [Plant] andSemU1596viola (violet) [Flower] vs. IWN: viola1(has_hyperonym pianta1 (plant)) and viola3(has_hyperonym fiore1 (flower)), both typed as[Group Plant].4 The Linking ToolThe LINKPSC_IWN software tool implemented tomap the lexical units of both lexicons works in asemiautomatic way using the ontologicalclassifications, the ?isa?
relations and somesemantic features of the two resources.
Since the157 semantic types of the SO provide a more fine-grained structure of the lexicon than the 65 topconcepts of the IWN ontology, which reflect onlyfundamental distinctions, mapping is PSC ?
IWNoriented.
The mapping process foresees thefollowing steps:1) Selection of a PSC semantic type and definitionof the loading criteria, i.e.
either all its SemUs oronly those bearing a given information;2) Selection of one or more mapping constraints onthe basis of the correspondences establishedbetween the conceptual classes of both ontologies,in order to narrow the automatic mapping;3) Human validation of the automatic mapping andstorage of the results;4) If necessary, relaxation/tuning of the mappingconstraints and new processing of the input data.By human validation of the automatic mappingwe also intend the manual selection of thesemantically relevant word sense pair(s) from theset of possible matches automatically output foreach SemU.
A decision is taken after checkingrelevant information sources such as hyperonyms,SemU/synset glosses and the IWN-ILI link.Besides the mapping results, a list of unmatchedword senses is provided which contains possibleencoding errors  and polysemous senses of theconsidered SemUs (e.g., kiwi (fruit) which isdiscarded when mapping the ?Animal?
class).
Someof these word senses proceed from an extension ofmeaning, e.g.
People-Human: pigmeo, troglodita(pygmy, troglodyte) or Animal-Human verme,leone (worm, lion) and are used with differentlevels of intentionality: either as a semantic surplusor as dead metaphors (Marinelli, 2006).More interestingly, the list of unmatched wordsalso contains the IWN word senses whose synset?sontological classification is incomplete or differentw.r.t.
the constraints imposed to the mapping run.Analyzing these data is therefore crucial to identifyfurther mapping constraints.
A list of PSC lexicalunits missing in IWN is also generated, which isimportant to appropriately assess the lexicalintersection between the two resources.5 ResultsFrom a quantitative point of view three main issuesare worth noting (cf.
Table 1): first, theconsiderable percentage of linked senses withrespect to the linkable ones (i.e.
words withidentical string and PoS value); second, the many163cases of multiple mappings; third, the extent ofoverlapping coverage.SemUs selected 27768Linkable senses 15193 54,71%Linked senses 10988 72,32%Multiple mappings 1125 10,23%Unmatched senses 4205 27,67%Table 1 summarizing dataMultiple mappings depend on the more finegrained sense distinctions performed in IWN.
Theeventual merging of the two resources would makeup for such discrepancy.During the linking process, many otherpossibilities of reciprocal improvement andenrichment were noticed by analyzing the lists ofunmatched word-senses.
All the inconsistencies arein fact recorded together with their differences inontological classification, or in the polysemytreatment that the mapping evidenced.
Somemapping failures have been observed due to adifferent approach to the treatment of polysemy inthe two resources: for example, a single entry inPSC corresponding to two different IWN entriesencoding very fined-grained nuances of sense, e.g.galeotto1 (galley rower) and galeotto2 (galleyslave).Other mapping failures are due to cases ofencoding inconsistency.
For example, when a wordsense from a multi-variant synset is linked to aSemU, all the other variants from the same synsetshould map to PSC entries sharing the same semantictype, yet in some cases it has been observed thatSemUs corresponding to variants of the same synsetdo not share a common semantic type.All these encoding differences or inconsistencieswere usefully put in the foreground by the linkingprocess and are worthy of further in-depth analysiswith a view to the merging, harmonization andinteroperability of the two lexical resources.6 Conclusion and Future WorkIn this paper the PSC-IWN linking of concreteentities, the methodology adopted, the toolimplemented to this aim and the results obtainedare described.
On the basis of the encouragingresults illustrated here, the linking process will becarried on by dealing with 3rdOrder Entities.
Ourattention will then be devoted to 2ndOrderEntitieswhich, so far, have only been object of preliminaryinvestigations on Speech act (Roventini 2006) andFeeling verbs.
Because of their intrinsiccomplexity, the linking of 2ndOrderEntities isexpected to be a far more challenging task.ReferencesJames Pustejovsky 1995.
