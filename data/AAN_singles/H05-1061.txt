Proceedings of Human Language Technology Conference and Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural LanguageProcessing (HLT/EMNLP), pages 483?490, Vancouver, October 2005. c?2005 Association for Computational LinguisticsMining Key Phrase Translations from Web CorporaFei Huang       Ying Zhang       Stephan VogelSchool of Computer ScienceCarnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213{fhuang, joy, vogel}@cs.cmu.eduAbstractKey phrases are usually among the mostinformation-bearing linguistic structures.Translating them correctly will improvemany natural language processing appli-cations.
We propose a new framework tomine key phrase translations from webcorpora.
We submit a source phrase to asearch engine as a query, then expandqueries by adding the translations oftopic-relevant hint words from the re-turned snippets.
We retrieve mixed-language web pages based on the ex-panded queries.
Finally, we extract thekey phrase translation from the second-round returned web page snippets withphonetic, semantic and frequency-distance features.
We achieve 46% phrasetranslation accuracy when using top 10 re-turned snippets, and 80% accuracy with165 snippets.
Both results are signifi-cantly better than several existing meth-ods.1 IntroductionKey phrases such as named entities (person, loca-tion and organization names), book and movie ti-tles, science, medical or military terms and others1, are usually among the most information-bearinglinguistic structures.
Translating them correctlywill improve the performance of cross-lingual in-formation retrieval, question answering and ma-chine translation systems.
However, these keyphrases are often domain-specific, and people con-1 Some name and terminology is a single word, which couldbe regarded as a one-word phrase.stantly create new key phrases which are not cov-ered by existing bilingual dictionaries or parallelcorpora, therefore standard data-driven or knowl-edge-based machine translation systems cannottranslate them correctly.As an increasing amount of web information be-comes available, exploiting such a huge informa-tion resource is becoming more attractive.
(Resnik1999) searched the web for parallel corpora while(Lu et al 2002) extracted translation pairs fromanchor texts pointing to the same webpage.
How-ever, parallel webpages or anchor texts are quitelimited, and these approaches greatly suffer fromthe lack of data.However, there are many web pages containinguseful bilingual information where key phrases andtheir translations both occur.
See the example inFigure 1.
This example demonstrates web pagesnippets2 containing both a Chinese key phrase ?????
and its translation, ?Faust?.We thus can transform the translation probleminto a data mining problem by retrieving thesemixed-language web pages and extracting theirtranslations.
We propose a new framework to minekey phrase translations from web corpora.
Given asource key phrase (here a Chinese phrase), we firstretrieve web page snippets containing this phraseusing the Google search engine.
We then expandqueries by adding the translations of topic-relevanthint words from the returned snippets.
We submitthe source key phrase and expanded queries againto Google to retrieve mixed-language web pagesnippets.
Finally, we extract the key phrase trans-lation from the second-round returned snippetswith phonetic, semantic and frequency-distancefeatures.2A snippet is a sentence or paragraph containing the keyphrase, returned with the web page URLs.483Figure 1.
Returned mixed-language web page snip-pets using source queryWe achieve 46% phrase translation accuracywhen using 10 returned snippets, and 80% accu-racy with 165 snippets.
Both results are signifi-cantly better than several existing methods.The reminder of this paper is organized as fol-lows: cross-lingual query expansion is discussed insection 2; key phrase translation extraction is ad-dressed in section 3.
In section 4 we present ex-perimental results, which is followed by relevantworks and conclusions.2 Retrieving Web Page Snippets throughCross-lingual Query ExpansionFor a Chinese key phrase f, we want to find itstranslation e from the web, more specifically, fromthe mixed-language web pages or web page snip-pets containing both f and e. As we do not know e,we are unable to directly retrieve such mixed-language web page using (f,e) as the query.Figure 2.
Returned mixed-language web page snip-pets using cross-lingual query expansionHowever, we observed that when the author of aweb page lists both f and e in a page, it is verylikely that f' and e' are listed in the same page,where f?
is a Chinese hint word topically relevantto f, and e?
is f?s translation.
Therefore if we knowa Chinese hint word f?, and we know its reliabletranslation, e?, we can send (f, e?)
as a query to re-trieve mixed language web pages containing (f, e).For example, to find web pages which containtranslations of ?????
(Faust), we expand thequery to ????+goethe?
since ????
(Goethe)is the author of ?????(Faust).
Figure 2 illus-trates retrieved web page snippets with expandedqueries.
We find that newly returned snippets con-tain more correct translations with higher ranks.To propose a ?good?
English hint e' for f, first weneed to find a Chinese hint word f' that is relevantto f. Because f is often an OOV word, it is unlikelythat such information can be obtained from exist-ing Chinese monolingual corpora.
Instead, we484query Google for web pages containing f. From thereturned snippets we select Chinese words f' basedon the following criteria:1. f' should be relevant to f based on the co-occurrence frequency.
On average, 300Chinese words are returned for each queryf.
We only consider those words that occurat least twice to be relevant.2.
f' can be reliably translated given the cur-rent bilingual resources (e.g.
the LDCChinese-English lexicon 3  with 81,945translation entries).3.
The meaning of f' should not be too am-biguous.
Words with many translationsare not used.4.
f' should be translated into noun or nounphrases.
Given the fact that most OOVwords are noun or noun phrases, we ig-nore those source words which are trans-lated into other part-of-speech words.
TheBritish National Corpus4 is used to gener-ate the English noun lists.For each f, the top Chinese words f' with thehighest frequency are selected.
Their correspond-ing translations are then used as the cross-lingualhint words for f. For example, for OOV word f =???
(Faust), the top candidate f's are ???
(Goethe)?, ?
??
(introduction)?, ???(literature)?
and ???(tragedy)?.
We expandthe original query ?????
to ????
+goethe?, ????
+ introduction?, ????
+ lit-erature?, ????
+ tragic?, and then query Googleagain for web page snippets containing the correcttranslation ?Faust?.3 Extracting Key Phrase TranslationWhen the Chinese key phrase and its English hintwords are sent to Google as the query, returnedweb page snippets contain the source query andpossibly its translation.
We preprocess the snippetsto remove irrelevant information.
The preprocess-ing steps are:1.
Filter out HTML tags;3http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2002L274 http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/2.
Convert HTML special characters (e.g.,?&lt?)
to corresponding ASCII code (?>?);3.
Segment Chinese words based on a maxi-mum string matching algorithm, which isused to calculate the translation probabilitybetween a Chinese key phrase and an Eng-lish translation candidate.4.
Replace punctuation marks with phrase sepa-rator ?|?;5.
Replace non-query Chinese words withplaceholder mark ?+?, as they indicate thedistance between an English phrase and theChinese key phrase.For example, the snippet?
<b>????
</b>?
(the bridges ofmadison county)[review].
???
?anjing |????
?2004-01-25 ???
02:13 | ?????
?is converted into| <b> ?
?
?
?
</b> |the_bridges_of_Madison_county | review |++ + | anjing | ++ ++  | 2004-01-25 +++ 0213 | + + ++ ++,where ?<b>?
and ?</b>?
mark the start and endpositions of the Chinese key phrase.
The candidateEnglish phrases, ?the bridges of madison county?,?review?
and ?anjing?, will be aligned to thesource key phrase according to a combined featureset using a transliteration model which captures thepronunciation similarity, a translation model whichcaptures the semantic similarity and a frequency-distance model reflecting their relevancy.
Thesemodels are described below.3.1 Transliteration ModelThe transliteration model captures the phoneticsimilarity between a Chinese phrase and an Eng-lish translation candidate via string alignment.Many key phrases are person and location names,which are phonetically translated and whose writ-ten forms resemble their pronunciations.
Thereforeit is possible to discover these translation pairsthrough their surface strings.
Surface string trans-literation does not need a pronunciation lexicon tomap words into phoneme sequences; thus it is es-pecially appealing for OOV word translation.
Fornon-Latin languages like Chinese, a romanization485script called ?pinyin?
maps each Chinese characterinto Latin letter strings.
This normalization makesthe string alignment possible.We adopt the transliteration model proposed in(Huang, et al 2003).
This model calculates theprobabilistic Levinstein distance between a roman-ized source string and a target string.
Unlike thetraditional Levinstein distance calculation, thecharacter alignment cost is not binary (0/1); ratherit is the logarithm of character alignment probabil-ity, which ensures that characters with similar pro-nunciations (e.g.
`p` and `b`) have higheralignment probabilities and lower cost.
Theseprobabilities are automatically learned from bilin-gual name lists using EM.Assume the Chinese phrase f has J Chinesecharacters, , and the English candidatephrase e has L English words, .
Thetransliteration cost between a Chinese query andan English translation candidate  is calculated as:Jfff ,..., 21Leee ,...,, 21fewhere is the pinyin of Chinese character ,is the i th letter in , and and are theiraligned English letters, respectively.is the letter transliteration probability.
The translit-eration costs between a Chinese phrase and anEnglish phrase is approximated by the sum of theirletter transliteration cost along the optimal align-ment path, which is identified based on dynamicprogramming.jy jfijy , jy jae ),( ijae)|( ,),( jiji yep3.2 Translation ModelThe translation model measures the semanticequivalence between a Chinese phrase and an Eng-lish candidate.
One widely used model is the IBMmodel (Brown et al 1993).
The phrase translationprobability is computed using the IBM model-1 as:where is the lexical translation probabili-ties, which can be calculated according to the IBMmodels.
This alignment model is asymmetric, asone source word can only be aligned to one targetword, while one target word can be aligned to mul-tiple source words.

The frequency-distance model meas-ures this correlation.Suppose S is the set of returned snippets forquery , and a single returned snippet isf Ssi ?

We empiri-cally choose m=2 in our experiments.
Thismeasure indicates how good the English phrase e iscompared with other candidates based on translit-eration model.

While trl?

represent the rela-tive rank of the current candidate among all com-pared candidates, C and  indicate itsabsolute likelihood, which is useful to reject thetop 1 incorrect candidate if the true translation doesnot occur in any returned snippets.trl transC4 ExperimentsWe evaluated our approach by translating a set ofkey phrases from different domains.
We selected310 Chinese key phrases from 12 domains as thetest set, which were almost equally distributedwithin these domains.
We also manually translatedthem as the reference translations.
Table 1 showssome typical phrases and their translations, whereone may find that correct key phrase translationsneed both phonetic transliterations and semantictranslations.
We evaluated inclusion rate, definedas the percentage of correct key phrase translationswhich can be retrieved in the returned snippets;alignment accuracy, defined as the percentage ofkey phrase translations which can be correctlyaligned given that these translations are included inthe snippets; and overall translation accuracy, de-fined as the percentage of key phrases which canbe translated correctly.
We compared our approachwith the LiveTrans5 (Cheng et.al.
2004) system, anunknown word translator using web corpora, andwe observed better translation performance usingour approach.4.1 Query Translation Inclusion RateIn the first round query search, for each Chinesekey phrase f, on average 13 unique snippets werereturned to identify relevant Chinese hint words f?,and the top 5 f's were selected to generate hintwords e?s.
In the second round f and e?s were sentto Google again to retrieve mixed language snip-pets, which were used to extract e, the correcttranslation of f.Figure 3 shows the inclusion rate vs. the numberof snippets used for three mixed-language webpage searching strategies:5 http://livetrans.iis.sinica.edu.tw/lt.htmlTable 1.

Search any web pages containing f (Zhangand Vines 2004);?
Only search English web pages6 contain-ing f (Cheng et al 2004);?
Search any web pages containing f andhint words e?, as proposed in this paper.The first search strategy resulted in a relativelylow inclusion rate; the second achieved a muchhigher inclusion rate.
However, because such Eng-lish pages were limited, and on average only 45unique snippets could be found for each f, whichresulted in a maximum inclusion rate of 85.8%.
Inthe case of the cross-lingual query expansion, thesearch space was much larger but more focusedand we achieved a high inclusion rate of 89.7%using 32 mixed-language snippets and 95.2% using165 snippets, both from the second round retrieval.6 These web pages are labeled by Google as ?English?

Alignment accuracies using different featuresThese search strategies are further discussed in thesection 5.4.2 Translation Alignment AccuracyWe evaluated our key phrase extraction model bytesting queries whose correct translations were in-cluded in the returned snippets.
We used differentfeature combinations on differently sized snippetsto compare their alignment accuracies.
Table 2shows the result.
Here ?Trl?
means using the trans-literation model, ?Trans?
means using the transla-tion model, and ?Fq-dis?
means using Frequency-Distance model.
The frequency-distance modelseemed to be the strongest single model in bothcases (with and without hint words), while incor-porating phonetic and semantic features providedadditional strength to the overall performance.Combining all three features together yielded thebest accuracy.
Note that when more candidatetranslations were available through query expan-sion, the alignment accuracy improved by 30%relative due to the frequency-distance model.However, using transliteration and/or translationmodels alone decreased performance because ofmore incorrect translation candidates from returnedsnippets.
After incorporating the frequency-distance model, correct translations have themaximum frequency-distance weights and aremore likely to be selected as the top hypothesis.Therefore the combined model obtained the high-est translation accuracy.4.3 Overall Translation QualityThe overall translation qualities are listed in Table3, where we showed the translation accuracies ofNo Hints(Inc = 44.19%)With Hints(Inc = 95.16%)Table 3.
Overall translation accuracythe top 5 hypotheses using different number ofsnippets.
A hypothesized translation was consid-ered to be correct when it matched one of the ref-erence translations.
Using more snippets alwaysincreased the overall translation accuracy, and withall the 165 snippets (on average per query), ourapproach achieved 80% top-1 translation accuracy,and 90% top-5 accuracy.We compared the translations from a researchstatistical machine translation system (CMU-SMT,Vogel et al 2003) and a web-based MT engine(BabelFish).
Due to the lack of topic-relevant con-texts and many OOV words occurring in the sourcekey phrases, their results were not satisfactory.
Wealso compare our system with LiveTrans, whichonly searched within English web pages, thus withlimited search space and more noises (incorrectEnglish candidates).
Therefore it was more diffi-cult to select the correct translation.

Key phrase translation from web mining and a MT engine489space and translation extraction features.
Figure 4illustrates three different search strategies.
Supposewe want to translate the Chinese query ?????.
(Cheng et al 2004) only searched 188 English webpages which contained the source query, and 53%of them (100 pages) had the correct translations.
(Zhang and Vines 2004) searched the whole55,100 web pages, 10% of them (5490 pages) hadthe correct translation.
Our approach used queryexpansion to search any web pages containing ?????
and English hint words, which was a largersearch space than (Cheng et al 2004) and morefocused compared with (Zhang and Vines 2004),as illustrated with the shaded region in Figure 4.For translation extraction features, we took advan-tage of machine transliteration and machine trans-lation models, and combined them with frequencyand distance information.Figure 4.
Web search space strategy comparison6 Discussion and Future WorkIn this paper we demonstrated the feasibility ofthe proposed approach by searching for the Englishtranslation for a given Chinese key phrase, wherewe use punctuations and Chinese words as theboundary of candidate English translations.
In thefuture we plan to try more flexible translation can-didate selection methods, and apply them to otherlanguage pairs.
We also would like to test our ap-proach on more standard test sets, and compare theperformance with other systems.Our approach works on short snippets for queryexpansion and translation extraction, and the com-putation time is short.
Therefore the search en-gine?s response time is the major factor ofcomputational efficiency.7 ConclusionWe proposed a novel approach to mine key phrasetranslations from web corpora.
We used cross-lingual query expansion to retrieve more relevantweb pages snippets, and extracted target transla-tions combining transliteration, translation and fre-quency-distance models.
We achieved significantlybetter results compared to the existing methods.8 ReferencesP.
