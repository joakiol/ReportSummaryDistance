A Linguistic and Computational Analysis of the German"Third Construction"*Owen RambowDepartment of CIS, University of PennsylvaniaPhiladelphia, PA 19104, USArambow@linc, cis.
upenn, edu1 The Linguistic DataFor German, most transformational lingusitic theories uchas GB posit center-embedding as the underlying word orderof sentences with embedded clauses:Weft ich \[das Fahrrad zu reparieren\] versprochen habeBecause I the bike (ace) to repair promised haveBecause I promised to repair the bikeHowever, far more common is a construction i which theentire subordinate clause is extraposed: Weil ich ti ver-sprochen habe, \[das Fahrrad zu reparieren\]i.
In addition,a third construction is possible, which has been called the"third construction", in which only the embedded verb, butnot its nominal argument has been extraposed: Weil ich dasFahrrad ti versprochen habe \[zu reparieren\]i,A similar construction can also be observed ff there aretwo levels of embedding.
In this case, the number of pos-sible word orders increases from 3 to 30, 6 of which areshown in Figure 1.
Of the 30 sentences, 7 are clearly un-grammatical (marked "*"), and 3 are extremely marginal,but not "flat out" (marked "?*").
The remaining 20 areacceptable to a greater or lesser degree (marked "ok" or"?").
No attempt has been made in the linguistic or com-putational literature to account for this full range of data.2 A Linguistic TAG AnalysisFollowing \[den Besten and Rutten 1989\], \[Santorini andKroch 1990\] argue that the third construction, ratherthan being a morphological effect of clause union, isin fact a syntactic phenomenon.
The construction de-rives from two independently motivated syntactic oper-ations, scrambling and (remnant) extraposition.
In thiswork, I have implemented this suggestion in a variant ofmulti-component TAG (TIC-TAG, \[Weir 1988\]) defined in\[Lee 1991\], which I will call SI-TAG.
In SI-TAG, as inMC-TAG, the elementary structures are sets of trees, whichcan be initial or auxiliary trees.
Contrary to the regular MC-'lAG, in SI-TAG the trees can also be adjoined into trees*This work was supported by the following grants: ARODAAL 03-89-C-0031; DARPA N00014-90-J-1863; NSF IRI 90-16592; and Ben Franklin 91S.3078C-1.
I would like to thank BobFrank and Aravind Joshi for fruitful discussions relating to thispaper.from the same set (set-internal djunction).
Furthermore,the trees can be annotated with dominance constraints (or"links"), which hold between foot nodes of auxiliary treesand nodes of other trees.
These constraints must be metwhen the tree set is adjoined.The following SI-TAG accounts for the German data.
Wehave 5 elementary sets: for the two verbs that subcategorizefor clauses, versuchen 'to try" and versprechen 'to promise',there are two sets each, representing the center-embeddedand extraposed versions.
For reparieren 'to repair', thereis only one set.
Sample sets can be found in Figure 2.
Thedominance links are shown by dotted lines.. .

\[iversuchen}Figure 2: Sample tree sets for versprechen 'to promise',and versuchen 'to try' with extraposed subordinate clauseThis analysis rules out those sentences that are ungram-matical, since the dominance constraints would be circularand could not be satisfied.
Derivations am possible forthe sentences that are acceptable.
However, the analysisalso provides derivations for the three sentences that areextremely marginal, but not ungrammatical.
Since thesesentences can be derived by a sequence of 3 licit steps, thecombination of any two of which is also licit, a syntacticanalysis cannot insightfully rule them out.
Instead, I wouldlike to explore a processing-based analysis.
A processingaccount holds two promises: first, it should account forthe differences in degree among the acceptable sentences;second, it should rule out the extremely marginal sentences.297(i)(iv)(xvi)(xxiii)(xxv)(xxvii)Weil ich des Fahrrad zu reparieren zu versuchen versproehen habe okWeil ich das Fahrrad zu versuchen zu reparieren versprochen habe 7Well ich versprochen babe, zu versuchen, das Falurad zu reparieren okWeil ich zu versuchen versprochen habe, das Fahrrad zu reparieren 7Weft ich das Fahrrad zu versuchen versprochen habe zu reparieren 7*Weil zu versuchen ich das Fahrrad versprochen habe zu reparieren *Figure 1: An excerpt from the data3 A Processing Account Based onBottom-Up EPDAs\[Joshi 1990\] proposes to model human sentence process-ing with an Embedded Pushdown Automaton (EPDA), theautomaton that recognizes tree adjoining languages.
Hedefines the Principle of Partial Interpretation (PPI), whichstipulates that structures are only popped from the EPDAwhen they are a properly integrated predicate-argumentstructure.
Furthermore, it requires that they be popped onlywhen they are either the root clause or they are the immedi-ately embedded clause of the previously popped structure.Before extending this approach to the extraposition cases,I will recast it in terms of a closely related automaton, theBottom-up EPDA (BEPDA) ~.
The BEPDA consists of afinite-state control and of a stack of stacks.
There are twotypes of moves: either an input is read and pushed onto anew stack on top of the stack of stacks, or a fixed num-ber of stacks below and above a designated stack on thestack of stacks is removed and a new symbol is pushedon the top of the designated stack, which is now the topstack (an "unwrap" move).
The operation of this automatonwill be illustrated on the German center-embedded sentenceN1N2N3VzVzVI 2.
The moves of the BEPDA are shownin Table 3.
The three nouns are read in, and each is pushedonto a new stack on top of the stack of stacks (steps 1-3).When V3 is read, it is combined with its nominal argumentand replaces it on the top stack (Step 4).
The PPI preventsV3** from being popped from the automaton, since V3** isnot the root clause and V2 has not yet been popped.
V2 isthen read and pushed onto a new stack (Step 5a).
In thenext move (5b), N2, V~ ?
and I/"2 (i.e., V2 and its nominaland clausal complements) are unwrapped, and the com-bined V2** is placed on top of the new top stack (the oneformerly containing V3**).
A similar move happens in steps6a and 6b.
Now, Vx *?
can be popped from the automatonin accordance with the PPI.
(Recall that V~ *?
contains itsclausal argument, V2 *?, which in turn contains its clausalargument, V3 *?, so that at this point all input has been pro-cessed.).
In summary, the machine operates as follows: itcreates a new top stack for each input it reads, and unwrapsaI am indebted to Yves Schabes for suggesting the use of theBEPDA.2I will abbreviate the lexemes o that for example sentence(i) will be represented asN1N3V3VzV1.
As in \[Joshi 1990\], anasterisk (e.g., V~*) denotes a verb not lacking any overt nominalcomplements.
In extension to this notation, a circle (e.g., 111")denotes averb not lacking any clausal complements.1 \[Na2 \[Na \[N23 (Na \[N24 (N~ (N25a \[N1 \[N25b \[N~ \[W*6a \[N1 \[1/2"*6b \[W*INs\[W*\[W\[v1\[?Figure 3: BEPDA moves for N1 N2 Na Va V21"1whenever and as soon as this is possible.Using a BEPDA rather than an EPDA has two advan-tages: first, the data-driven bottom-up automaton repre-sents a more intuitive model of human sentence processingthan the top-down automaton; second, the grammar thatcorresponds to the BEPDA analysis is the TAG grammarproposed independently on linguistic grounds, as shown inFigure 4 a.
The unwrap in move 5afo corresponds to theadjunction of tree /~2 to tree ota at the root node of ~3(shown by the arrow), and the unwrap in Move 6a/b to theadjunction of tree/31 to tree/~2.S ~ S ~  S ~-mmmN 3 V 3 N 2 S N 1 SS V 2 S V 1Figure 4: Derivation for German Center-EmbeddingLet us consider how the BEPDA account can be ex-tended to the extraposition cases, such as sentence (xxiii),NtV2V1N3Va.
If we simply use the BEPDA for center-embedding described above, we get the sequence of movesin Figure 5.
In move 3a, we can unwrap the nominal ar-gument and verb of the matrix clause, which is popped inmove 3b in accordance with the PPI.
In move 3c, the clauseof V2" can also be popped.
Then, the remaining noun andverb are simply read and popped.If we use any of the metrics proposed in \[Joshi 1990\](such as the sum of the number of moves that input el-ements are stored in the stack) we predict that sentence3In the interest of conciseness, VP nodes and empty categorieshave been omitted.2981 \[~rl2 \[~q \[W3a \[Aq \[W \[v~3b \[V?
W3c \[W4 \[I~35 Iv3"Figure 5: BEPDA moves for N1VzVtNaV3(xxiii) is easier to process than sentence (i), which appearsto be correcL It is easy to see how this analysis extendsto sentence (xvi).
Its processing would be predicted to bethe easiest possible, and in fact it is the word order by farpreferred by German speakers.Now let us turn to the third construction cases.
If weassume the PPI, the only way for a simple TAG to derivethe relevant word orders (e.g., N1N2V1V2) is by an analy-sis corresponding to verb raising as employed in Dutch.In Section 2, I mentioned linguistic evidence against averb-raising analysis for German.
Processing considera-tions also speak against his approach: we would have topostulate that German speakers can either use the Germancenter-embedding strategy, or the Dutch verb-raising strat-egy.
This would mean that German speakers hould be asgood at cross-serial dependencies a at center-embedding.However, in German at levels of embedding beyond 2, thecenter-embedding construction is clearly preferred.
We areleft with the conclusion that we must go beyond simpleTAGs, as was in fact proposed in Section 2.
Therefore, asimple BEPDA will not handle such cases either, and wewill need an extension of the automaton.
This extensionwill be explained by way of an example, sentence (iv).N1, Na, V2 and Va are read in and placed on new topstacks (moves 1 - 4a).
(Popping I/2" would violate thePPI.)
Now we unwrap V2* and combine it with 1/3".
Thisyields 1/2?
: while formerly V2* did not lack any nominalarguments (since it has none of its own), \]/2?
now has itsclausal complement, but it is lacking a nominal comple-ment (namely Va's) 4.
The reason why Na and V3 can'tbe unwrapped around V~ is that Va does not subcatego-rize for a clausal complement.
We then unwrap N3 aroundV~ and get V~** in step 4c.
We can then unwrap and popthe matrix clause, and then pop Vz** in the usual manner.The grammar corresponding to the BEPDA of Figure 6 isshown in Figure 7 (the arrows again show the sequence ofadjunctions): we see that the deferred incorporation of Nacorresponds to the use of a tree set for the clause of V3.Finally, let us consider the extremely marginal sentence(xxv), N1NaV2V1Va.
Here, the automaton as defined sofar would simply read in the input elements and push themon separate stacks.
At no point can a clause be unwrapped(because both verb/noun pairs are too far apart), and theextension proposed to handle the third construction, thedeferred incorporation ofnominal arguments, cannot apply,4This operation can be likened to the operation of functioncomposition i a categorial framework.1 \[Na2 \[N1 \[Ns3 \[Na \[N~4a IN1 IN34b \[Na \[JV3a?

The automaton rejects the string, as desired.4 Current  and Future  WorkIn summary, the linguistic analysis correctly predicts whichsentences are ungrammatical, and the processing analy-sis shows promise for correctly ruling out the extremelymarginal sentences, and for accounting for the differencesin acceptability among the remaining sentences.
Immediatefurther goals include testing the coverage of this approach,and exploring the relation between the proposed extensionto the BEPDA and the form of the SI-TAG grammar.References\[Besten and Rut~n 1989\] Besten, Hans den and Rutten,Jean, 1989.
