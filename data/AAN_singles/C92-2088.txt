Our approaclL to solvethese difficulties is to make use of translation exam-pies in two distinct languages that have (lnite differentsyntactic structures and word meanings.
The roe.sonwe took this at)preach is that in many cases both syn:tactic aLrd semantic ambignitics arc resolved by com-paring analyzed resnlts from botb languages.
In thispaper, we propose a method Ibr resolving the syntac-tic ambiguities of translation cxaml>lcs of bilingualcorpora and a method for acquiring lexical knowl-edge, such as ease frames of verbs and attribute setsel noons.1 In t roduct ionIt has become widely accel)ted that developing a largescale semantic dictionary is indispensable to futurenatural language research.
ILL recent years, severalresearch activities for compiling selnantic dictionar-ies tot natural anguage processing have been uudcr-taken One of the approaches in this research is at-tempts to compile dictionaries by band.

Most of the works undertake shallowanalysis of texts and they extract only superticial lex-ical information.For the development of tile techniques of knowledgeacquisition from natural anguage texts, it is very im-portant to improve the httter approach of cornpilingsemantic dictionaries by comimter l)rograuL~.
Ilow-ever, there are at least two basic difficulties in thisat)preach1.
Tire i~robh~m (ff syntact ic  ambigui t iesWhen analyzing a sentence., syntactic ambiguitiesoften remain.
So i~ is not easy to obtain correctparsed results automatically.2.
The, probh~rrr of polyue,myit often happens that one word has several mean-ings and corre.sponrls to ,~cveral concepts.
So it isnot easy to associate one sm'fa~e word with ollecorrect conceptHal item.Our approach to solve these diiliculties is to makeuse of translatitm cxarnples in two distinct languagesthat have quite different syntactic structures andword mf~anings (such as English and Japanese), andto c(nnt~are analyzed results from each language, h|many (:asc~, the two languagcs }Lave different ypesof syntactic ambiguities, anti comparison of syntacticstructures of both bmguagcs helps to resolve the am-biguities.

\["or example, in tire caseof the translation example given in Example 1, bothsyntactic and semantic ambiguities are resolved.Example 1E: I hung my coat on the hook.J: ~:L (I) ;~ (topic) ~2~ (coat) ~ (ca.se-m~trker)~'5" (hook) lZ (case-marker) zi'$~'f: (hung)o1.
Syntact i c  d i sumbiguat ionThe English sentence in Example 1 is syntacti-cally ambiguous because the prepositional phrase"on the hook" can modify both the verb "hung"aad tim noun phrase "my coat" using grammat-ical knowledge only.
On the other band, in theJapanese sentence, the phrase "7)~ ', Is_" can mod-ify nothing but the verb "~t ; t f : " .
Thus, ifknowledge about word equivalence pairs such as( I, ~, ), (hung, ~'~t : ), (coat, _t-.
;a ), (hook, ~' g )are available from bilingual dictionaries, the ambi-guity of pp-attachment is resolved by syntacticallymatching the structures of the two sentences.2.
Semant ic  d i sambiguat ionThe verb "~)~l~ "  in tile Japanese sentence is atypical Japanese polyserny.
This verb has six sub-entries in a Japanese dictionary that has about70,000 entries, and ten English equivalent verbs( "hang", "spend", "play", etc.)
in a Japanese-English dictionary that has about 50,000 entries.So, it is not easy to associate the surface word"~qJ '~"  with its exact meaning.
Ilowever, withthe translation examl)le , the corresponding En-glish verb such ms "hang" helps to find the mean-irrg of the Japanese verb "7~19 ~,5''.In this paper, we propose a method for resolvingthe syntactic ambiguities of translation examples inbilingual corpora and a method for acquiring lexi-cal knowledge, such as case frames of verbs and at-tribute sets of nouns.
In our framework, first a pairof sentences of both languages are syntactically ana-lyzedtand translated into feature descriptions, whichrepresent dependency structures of the pbrases in thesentences.
Although feature descriptions are gener-ated by grarnmatical knowledge only, they are quitesuitable to represent case frames of verbs.
Then thesefeature descriptions of the two languages are com-pared, or unified, using knowledge about word equiv-alence from bilingual dictionaries.
In this matchingprocess, one word in the English sentence could beeqnivalent to several words in the translated Japanese1Tbe Japanese morphological analyT~r lm.s 14 part of apeechand about 36,000 words.

Also one word in the Japanese sentencecould be equivalent to several words in the translatedEnglish sentence.
In order to realize the matchingprocess between two languages including these sev-eral word equivalence cases, we introduce a unifica-tion algorithm based on sets of compatible pairs ofatomic values and feature labels in Chapter 2.In Chapter 3, we statistically evaluated the processof syntactic disambiguation.
The success ratio of dis-ambiguation is about 63~68 % for translation exam-pies in a Japanese-English dictionary.
At present, wehave already collected about 50,000 translation exam-pies from a machine readable Japanese-English dic-tionary (Kodansha Japanese-English Dictionary \[10\])and an English learners' textbook.
We have extractedcase frames for several verbs as a simple experiment.The results are described in Chapter 4.2 Un i f i ca t ion  o f  Feature  De-sc r ip t ions  o f  Two Languages2.1  Unification based on Sets of Com-patible Pairs of Features and Val-uesIn our framework of sentence analysis, a sentence ineach language is parsed and translated into featuredescriptions, which represent dependency structuresof the phrases in the sentence.
Ill this section, we ba-sically use and extend Kasper and Rounds' notationof feature description logic (FDL \[6\]) to describe ourunification algorithm of feature descriptions, exceptthat we don't use path equivalence.When unifying feature descriptions of two lan-guages, knowledge about word equivalence takenfrom bilingual dictionaries i used to decide whetherall atomic value of one language is compatible withan atomic value of the other language.
This is alsothe casc with feature labels.
Knowledge about wordequivalence from bilingual dictionaries can be re-garded as knowledge about compatibility of atomicvalues and feature labels of feature descriptions.From this standpoint, we introdnce a unification al-goritlHn based on sets of compatible pairs of atomicvalues and feature labels.Data  S t ruc tureLet A and L be sets of symbols used to denote atomicvalues and feature labels.

That  is, each feature label pair (li,lj)in CL has a probability plj(O < Pij <_ 1) calculatedfrom statistical data.
This Pij represents the proba-bility that the semantic role of feature Ii in a specificfeature description of one lamguage is the same asthat of feature l.i ill another specific feature descrip-tion of the other language.

These ex-ceptional pairs are not contained ill CL, i.e., tlmirprobabilities are 0.

So in this ease, the upperone is regarded as tile correct ease frame example fortile pair (write, ~" < ).3 Syntact i c  D isambiguat ion :Exper iment  and  Eva luat ionin order to evaluate how well syntactic ambiguities oftranslation examples are resolved, we made all exper-iment of syntactic disambiguation using 189 transla-tion examples extracted from a J apanese-English dic-tionary.
Firstly, each sentence of a translation exam-pie is syntactically analyzed and translated into fea-ture descriptions.
For 44 translation examples, syn-tactic analysis of tile Japanese or English sentenceis faile.d.
For those which are successfully analyzed,the average number of feature descriptions generatedfrom one scntcncc is 4.4 for Japanese and 17.1 for En-glish.
Secondly, these feature descriptions are unified.After this process of syntactic disamhiguation, from86 translation examples, a uniquc ee~sc framc of theunified verb pair of Japanese and English is acquired.Calculating from this result, the success ratio of ac-quiring unified case frames of verbs, (the number oftranslation examples uch that a unique unified caseframe of verbs is acquired from each translation exam-pie)/ (tile uumher of translation examples uch thateach sentence is successfully analyzed), is 86/145 =59.3%.
And the success ratio of syntactic disambigua-tion, (tile number of sentences uch that a uniqueease frame of the verb is acquircd from more thanone feature descriptions)/ (tile number of sentencessuch that more than one feature descriptions are orig-inally generated), is 70/103 = 68.0% for Japanese,and 84/133 = 63.2% for English.4 Lexica l  Knowledge Acqu is i -t ion  o f  Verbs4.1  Acqu i r ing  Case  F rames  o f  VerbsAs described ill 2.2, a feature description unified be-tween English aud Japanese is as below.pred : (write, ~ < )tense : pastobj ?~ pred : (letter ~5.\]~ )F pred <p,,,ea, ) I ( h -c ) /.wt t  , " : L spec  : a JThis feature description tells that tile verbal con-cept represented hy tile pair of the English verb"tv~te" and the Japane~qe verb "~ <" have at leastthree eases that are marked by some syntactic in-formation mid some surface functional words suchas (subj, *2 ), (obj, ~ ), (with,  T' ).
it also tells thateach case takes a certain nominal coueept representedby tile pair of English and Japanese words, such asU, *h >, <fetter, ~;:~ ), (pe,leit, ~ ).
Once a largeamount of this kind of data  is collected, statisticaldata ahout case frames of verbs eaal he extracted,making use of a thesaurus of nominM concepts 7.
Inthe remainder of this section, we will illustrate a gen-eral procedure for acquiring case frames of verbs.Lct us start with a collection of a large amountof unified feature descriptions like above for a specificJapanesc verb V~.
Suppose that we want to get possi-ble case frames of this verb.
By a case frame, we meansomething tikc a feature description for this verb, con-sisting of surface cases each of which is marked hy apostpositional particlc p~ and some specific semanticcategories taken from a thesaurus like BGI\[.
Usually,a verh has several distinct case frames.
However, it isnot easy to extract those case frames automatical lyonly from the collected unified feature descriptions.So the system finds critical points to distinguish pos-sible case frames for a verh using some heuristics,then it asks tile human instructor whether the dis-tinctions of ease frames arc correct.
These heuristicsand human interactions arc smmnarized as follows.7At present, ~m oiL-line thesaurus called 'Bunrui GoiHyou'(BGH)\[8\] is available for Japanese.
BGII has a six-layered abstraction hierarchy mrd more t|mat 60,OOO words areassigned at the leaves.
At the presettt stage, it is ntot cer-tain whether this the~sautim s reliable enouglt for our initialresearch target of acquiring case frames of verbs.

Semantic Categor'y in a ThesaurusFirst, collect the nouns marked by pj in a fea-ture description of the verb Vj from the set ofunified feature descriptions.
Then mark each col-lected noun in the thesaurus.
If the most specificcommon layer of the marked nouns is low enough,then we assume that the case marked by pj takesa noun of the semantic ategory that correspondsto that layer.
But if the most specific commonlayer is higher than a predetermined layer s, theinformation provided by that layer is too generalfor tile semantic ategories of the case marked bypj.
For instance, it is quite rare that both an ani-mate concept and an abstract concept can be thesubject of a certain verb.
Such a case stronglysuggests that the verb has at least two distinctconceptual meanings or two distinct case frames.It then becomes necessary to classify the markednouns in the thesaurus.2.
Bilingual Intersection of ConceptsSome of the heuristics come from the advan-tages of bilingual intersection of concepts, whichwe have already shows in Chapter 1 as seman-tic disambiguation.
For a Japanese verb Vj andits case marked by a postpositional particle p j ,suppose that unified feature descriptions uchas \[ pred:(VEl ,Vj )  , ( IE I ,p j ) :{NE1,NJ I )  \] and\[ pred:(VE2 , Vj), ( IE2,pJ):(NE2,NJ2) \] are oh-tained.
Both of these two feature descriptionshave a feature label pj for Vj.
llowever, if VE1and V~2 are different verbs or IEl and IE2 aredifferent feature labels, these two feature descrip-tions may be classified into different case framesof the verb Vj.3.
Correlation of CasesAnother heuristics are related to sentence pat-terns of verbs.
Sometimes the ease marked bypj has a correlation with other eases in sentencepatterns.
If the correlations between cases are de-tected, then it helps tile classification, and somesentence patterns (or c0.se frames) of the verb Vjwill be aeqnired.Human Interact ionsAs described above, the system can find critical pointsto distinguish possible case frames for a verb by thoseheuristics.
The system, however, cannot determinethe distinction only with positive data collected fromexamples.
The main purpose of human interactionis to obtain negative xamples.
The system asks thehuman instructor whether a case marked by p J1 andanother case marked by P J2 call co-occur or not.

In or-der to acquire stable lexicat knowledge base, we de-cided to limit hmnan interactions to yes-no type ofquestions and answers, such that the system asks thehuman instructor whether something is true or falseso that he can answer only yes or no.4 .2  Examples  and  Eva luat ionsWc have collected about 50,000 translation exam-pies from a machine readable dal)anese-English dic-tionary and an English learners' textbook.

NO.The postpositional particle "~:" is used to mark twodifferent cases of the verb "~ < (write)" in Japm~esesentences.
One of them represents things on whichsmnething is written like in "wrile something on ,sh~:et of paper", and the other reI)resents someone towhom a correspondence is written, like ill "wtalc aletter to a lover".
The difference of these two usagesis clear by tit(: bilingual feature label pairs (on, ~= )and (to, {~ ).
'File human instructor answers that onlythese two ease slots cannot co-occur.
Then two caseframes are obtained as in Table 3.This simple experiment suggests that it is quitepossible to acquire case frames of verbs from bilingualcorpora if enough translation examples are available.Actually, on tim assumption that 200 translation ex-amples arc necessary for acquiring case framcs of oncverb, 100,000 translation examples are necessary for70 verbs.
If a bilingual corpus of 1,000,000 transla-tion examples is obtained, it is possible to compilea semantic dictionary with the same scale as IPAI,through a little interaction with a human instructorfor each verb.
Wc think it possible to construct abilingual corl)us of that scale or more in the near fit-lure,5 Conc lud ing  RemarksWe haw~ proposed a method for resolving the syntac-tic ambiguities of translation examples of bilingualcorpora and a method for acquiring case frames ofverbs.
At present, we are extending our prototypesystem for acquiring case frames of verbs, attd thedetail of the extended system will be reported in thefuture.
We believe that the I)roposed method is appli-cable to sew:ral otller problenrs as well.
One of themis to acquire features of nominal concepts.
We are atthe moment looking at some specitie nominal expres-sion "A q) B" in Japanese, corresponding literally to"I1 of A" in English.
That  expression specifies a vari-ety of relationships of noun phrases, which are oftenstated in different expressions in English.
They willhelp to acquire typical attr ibutes of nominal conceptsfl'om bilingual corpora.
Our ntethod is also useful tocollect parsed traamlation examples tbr example-basedtranslation \[9\] attd to acquire translation patterns be-tween two languages.References\[l\] \[h'cnt, M.: "Automatic Acquisition of Subcatego-rization Frames from Untagged Text", f>roc, of the29th Anuual Meeti.9 of the AUL, 1991.\[2\] l)ag;~n, I., ltai, A. and Schwall, IJ.
