Our project aims atintegration of a Knowledge Base (KB) in a MATsystem and studies the integration principles as wellas the internal interface between language and know-ledge.
The paper presents ome related work, rel~)rtsthe solutions applied in our project and tries to gene-raiize our evaluation of the selected MAT approach.1.
Introduct ionThe notion of MAT comprises approaches where - incontrast o MT - the human user keeps the initiativein translation.
MAT ranges between intelligent exteditors and workbenches aiming at user modellingand partial MT.
A principal problem, however, is thesupport of domain knowledge since it affects the qua-lity of the translated text.
Moreover, the time spentfor domain familiarization is estimated as 30-40% ofthe total translation time (KiWi90).This paper discusses an innovative approach toknowledge based MAT: a KB is systematicallyintegrated in a fr,'unework providing linguistic as wellas domain knowledge support.
I,inguistic support isassured by relevant resources: gl','unmatic~d and lexicaldata.
Domain expl~mations are generated from a KBof Conceptual Graphs (CGs) (Sow84).
The systeminterface offers a standard ialog: while translating,the user highlights words/texts, chooses queries frommenus and receives NL answers from where newreqnests can be started.
The results reported here wereachieved in the joint Germ,m-Bulgarian project DB-MAT 2 (vHa91, vHAn94).Depending on the viewpoint, DB-MAT can be com-pared to various approaches and/or systems: (i) enco-ding of term's meaning: - to lexicons and tennbanks(see 2.1) and knowledge based termbanks (see 2.2);(ii) generation of explanations allowing follow-upquestions and cl,'u'ifications - e.g.
IDAS (see 2.3);(iii) NL generation from CGs (Bon96, AnBo96).Below we present related approaches and the DB-MAT paradigm.
Our opinion about he costs and be-nefits of the knowledge based MAT is clearly stated.1 Current: University of Sheffield, Department ofComputer Science, Regent Court, 211 Portobello Str.,Sheffield S14DP, e-mail K.Bontcheva@dcs.shef.ac.uk2 Funded by Volkswagen Foundation (Germany) in1993-1995.

Related WorkSome approaches ,are now discussed with commentson file rationale of a knowledge based MAT design.2.1.
Lexicons and TermbanksIll (machine-readable) terminological lexicons domainknowledge is contained in text definitions.
A concep-tu,'d hierarchy is sometimes sketched by pointers like"see.." in the definition: the super- and sister-con-cepts ,are related to the lexic~d entry, i.e.
to the deno-ted concept.
An intuitive unification of the lexicalunits and their implicit knowledge items is assumed.Concept-oriented termbanks upport a hierarchicalskeleton of underlying concepts and thus the know-ledge cm~ be treated fonnalty during its construction,use and up&lting.
Text definitions, however, are writ-ten mmmally; the progress is that the lexical entriesand conceptmd elements are encoded independently.
Inmonolingual tcnnbanks, the tenn is a concept labelas well as a lexicon item (e.g.
Co,'Mn93).
In cases ofbilingualism (e.g.
Fis93) every NL has its own con-ceptual structure and translation equivalents are map-pings of one conceptmd structure onto another.An evaluation for "domain lolowledge in translation"reveals knowledge content, organization ,'rod usage :(1) conceptual knowledge is encoded in textdefinitions, written manually in multilingualenvironment.
Domain facts are not included in anydefinition although they ,are very important for theunderstanding of technical texts; (2) knowledge isartifici,'dly segmented into text fragments, organizedalphabetically around lexical entries.
The thne-consu-ruing search for semantically related terms is to beperformed by the reader; (3) the user gets the wholebulk of inlormation without any opportunity to filterfor relevant aspects.
The "inheritance of features"~dong the hierarchy is to be made by the reader.2.2.
Terminological Knowledge BasesThe term meanings are encoded in formal anguagesinstead of text definitions.
Briefly we mention: (1)COGNITERM (MSBE92): the term meaning is rep-resented in a frmne-like structure which is accessibleby names of concepts or their characteristics.
For anew NL, another KB is built up "based on the tran-slation equiwdents provided tbr concepts in the sour-ce language KB" (SkMe90); (2) Translators' Work-Bench (TWB): the meanings of each term are descri-bed by CGs.
A concept is related to several terms viasynonyms and foreign NL equivalents (HoAh92).The available xamples present disconnected, thoughformal definitions of meanings.
However, there is (1)1016no coherent, homogenous knowledge source for asystematic conceptual evaluation; (2) no access by acontext sensitive user interface; (3) no theoreticallysound solution for multilingmd systems.2.3.
Generat ion  of  Exp lanat ionsThere are similarities between DB-MAT and otherNL generation systems, e.g.
IDAS which producestechnical documentation l~om a domain KB andlinguistic and contextual models (RMLe95).
in asense IDAS builds an on-line user interface to KBsand provides ystem mmwers by NL generation.
Thesystem generates hypertext nodes (both text andlinks) with relevant follow-up questions.
Thefollowing particularities however display tiledifferences between the systems: (1) IDAS is a full-scale application, its KI,-ONE like KB contains moredomain information and the proper system evaluationcan be performed; (2) the hypertext links act asvisuM hints for the available relevant information,while the user should "guess" that in DB-MAT; (3)the DB-MAT KB pretends to be arbitrary, i.e.
we in-vestigated the integration of arbitrary domain KB intoapplications in the humanities; as a contrast theIDAS KB contains fixed number of (rusk-adequate)"conceptmd relations" mtd supports fixed query types;(4) the systems cert~dnly have diflcreut interface de-sign oriented towards dilfbrent go~ds and user types.3.
Benefits of the Knowledge Based MATThe optimal separation of domain knowledge as anindependent source facilitates its structuring and pro-cessing and makes its theoretic~d l'oundation sound.KBs seem difficult to acquire (compared to informaltextual exicons), but this is not true with respect oformal and heterogeneous lexicon structures.
More-over, formal descriptions are built up increasinglyboth for research and industrial applications, e.g.formal specifications iu'e developed by wuious acqui-sition tools.
Thus DB-MAT aims at the reuse of KBsin a MAT system.Keeping knowledge in a separate structure nables itsprocessing with h)nnal operations.
Especially li)nnalconsistency and semantic coherency can be bestachievexl in a well-defined representation lmlguagc.
InDB-MAT the NL explanation semantics is kept asCGs as long its possible: we tailor the explanation tothe users' expectatious by the formal operationsprojection mid join.
By inheritance the adequatedegree of detailness in the generated answer isprovided (AuBo96).In multilinguM MAT, the CG type hierarchy provedto be particularly useful in case of e.g.terminological gaps.
For missing translationequivalents, the type hierarchy provides NLexplanations about the "relative position" of thehighlighted term.
The attributes of the node areverbalized in the source language to facilitateparaphrases in the target one (WiAn93).4.
DB-MATDB-MAT is a knowledge-bm;ed TWB providing lin-guistic as well as domain knowledge support.
Thesystem has a user-fliendly interface, with a main win-dow separated into two scrollable regions lor the so-urce and target exts.
The mmslator selects the expla-nation language (Gern~ln, Bulgarian) mid Om detail-uess of the generated explanations (Less, More) withradio buttons.
DB-MAT provides figures as well, tofacilitate the user's undcrstandiug of the domain.Currently all figures are associated to lexicon entries.4.1.
Ma in  menuExcept File and Edit with their stmtdard functionali-ty, the mmn menu contains three t~sk-spccific lems:- tinder Note the user selects flags (<Check later>,<Gap>, etc.)
to be inserted in the text as reminders;- In format ion  provides mouolingual support andaccess to awfilable figures.
(\]rmnmaticld data fromthe lexicon is shown to the user.
Under the submenuExplanat ions,  a NL explanation is generated forterms while for non-terms a textual definition isgiven instead (the user should always get somethingwithout bothering fl-om whcm the answer comes);- Mult i l ingual offers bilingual data.Under T ran-slations the lexicon correspondences are presented.The other subitems are Idioms and Examples.4.2.
The LexiconI)B-MAT uses one lexicon, i.e.
general vocabularyand terms arc distinguished by checking whether textdcfinitinns or KB-pointers arc avifilablc.
There is oneentry per meaning.
Special links contained in andconsists of (Fig.l, "crossref" of Ids #35, 29, 40),acquired scant-automatically, provide precise mapp-ings of tile chosen text segments out() lexicon items.The lexicon contains (BoEu95): (1) moq)hologicaldata organized in morpho-groups (part of speech, inflection class, verb types, etc); (2) syntactic informa-tion - syntax groups used by the NL generator onlyand some text striugs (e.g.
list of collocations); (3)synonyms (Ids #29, 40), antonyms, abbreviations;(4) text definitions for general vocabulary (e.g.
ld#17); (5) relbmnces for bilingmd correspondences.4.3.
The KB and the Query Mapper  (QM)The KB consists of concepts, a type hierarchy andconceptual graphs.
Each graph is either a semanticdefinition of a term or contains certain f~tctualknowledge.
The QM, our "what to say" component,extracts as temporary graphs (by CG projection)knowledge fragments to be verbalized.
There is nofixed prcdefined schema mapping a user request osome knowledge fragments.
Given a highlighted term(i.e.
its KB concept), and the user request for domainknowledge, the QM searches the KB on the fly andextracts all relevant facts according to the conceptualrelations.
Depending on the detailncss level, allattributes mid char, tcteristics are inherited fl'om a moregeneric n(xle.For each query type, the QM m,-dntains a list of rele-vant conceptual relations.
So far, the QM has a fixedscope of extraction: for most of the conceptual relati-1017er FREYL1T Minerali31- und RestNabscheider dient zur ~ser  queries.,/bscheidung von ~ und Feststoffen aus I Typ~s of...bwasserstr6men.

Generation of explanations: 1 - a synonym from the lexicon; 2 - the supertype from the KBtype hierarchy, 3 - definite article because \[OIL FRAGMENT\] is already present in the context; 4 - thecharacteristic \[DENSITY\]; 5,6 - the attributes \[FLOATING\] and \[ROUGHLY DISPERSED\]; 7 - a re-lative clause for \[LIGHTER THAN WATER\] since it cannot be verbalised as an adjective; 8 - the secondgraph with focused \[OIL FRAGMENT\], in passive voice because the graph is traversed against he arcs.ons it is "one step around" the selected concept.
Nes-ted graphs (e.g.
situations) are extracted as unbreakab-le knowledge fragments due to their specificmeanings.
The explanation semantics i under certaincontrol: the QM does not allow trivial answers like"Oil separator is a non-animated physical object" etc.Detailed iscussion is given in (AnBo96).4.4.
The Generator (EGEN)The generation algorithms are strongly influenced bysome features of the CGs and their well-definedoperations.
An important asset of the CGs proved tobe their non-hierarchical structure, allowing for thegeneration to start from any KB node without anygraph transformations.
Thus EGEN may select thesubject and the main predicate of each sentence froma linguistic perspective rather than being influencedby the structuring of the underlying semantics (aswith the frequently used tree-like notations).EGENs input is: (1) the relevant knowledge pool;(2) the explanation language; (3) the highlightedconcept(s) (the corresponding term(s) will become theglobal focus of the generated explanation); (4) thequery type (necessary for the selection of an appropri-ate text-organisation schema); (5) all iterative callflag indicating arequest for fuaher clarification.In order to produce a coherent explanation, EGEN or-ders the CGs by applying a suitable text organisationschema (AnBo96) - definition, similarity or difference(similar to those in McKe85).
Afterwards the genera-tor breaks some CGs into smaller graphs or joinssimilar ones into a single graph to ensure that eachCG is expressible in a single sentence.
FinallyEGEN verbalizes the CGs by applying the utterancepath approach - the algorithm searches for a cyclicpath which visits each node and relation at least once.If a node is visited several times then grammar ulesdetermine when and how it is verbalized.
As proposed1018in (Sow84), concepts are mapped into nouns, verbs,adjectives and adverbs, while conceptual relations aremapped into "functional words" or syntactic ele-ments.
The Sowa's algorithm is extended (AnBo96)to: (1) process extended referents (e.g.
measures,conjunctive and disjunctive sets, etc.
); (2) grouprelevant features together (e.g.
first utter all"dimension" attributes, then all "weight" attributes,etc.
instead of mixing them up); (3) introducerelative clauses mtd conjunctions; (4) generate asentence tree allowing Ibr future transformations.
TheAPSG grammar used by EGEN is implemented inProlog.Additionally, EGEN keeps all uttered concepts in astack and later refers to them using a definite articleor a pronoun.
This stack is cleared in the end of theexplanation, unless there is an iterative request.A request for definition ("What is?")
of "Olphasen" isgiven on Fig.
1.
Some relevant lexicon entries ,arepresented.
The QM extracts the supertype and theconceptual relations ATTR, CHAR and RESULT(AnBo96).
The extracted temporal graphs ,are shownin linear notation.
They contain ,all occurrences of the"highlighted" concept and rite necessary conceptualrelations.
The QM has applied the type contractionoperation in order to "simplify" the graphs.
Thusthere are complex concepts like \[LIGHTER THANWATER\] which have corresponding type definitions.5.
Costs of the knowledge based MATIt is difficult o acquire the interrelated lexicon/KBalthough once the KB is acquired, the reuse effectwill decrease tile costs of adding a new NL to thesystem.
In DB-MAT we used special lexiconacquisition tools and we plan to develop tools withrestricted NL interlace for future KB acquisition.
Ourestimation is that DB-MAT resources ,are not morecomplicated than the lexicons in sophisticated MTsystems, e.g.
the KBMT lexicon and ontology(GoNi91).
However, tile proper use of AI-methodsrequires additional study, design efforts and evalualionexpcrhnents oriented towards knowledge bxsed NLP.6.
Implementation and ConclusionThe DB-MAT demo is implemented in LPA MACProlog32.
Special exicon acquisition ttxlls were de-veloped.
The German lexicon contains about 900entries.
The KB (about 300 concept nodes and 30conceptual relations) was manually acquired from atextbook and encyclopedias in admixture separation.The lexicon covers a demo text but any MacPrologreadable file demonstrates the DB-MAT features if itcontains the basic terminology (enabling requests lordomain explanations).DB-MAT studies one of the possib!e applications ofKB-methods to computational terminology and trans-lation aid tools.
Further esearch is aimed at: (1)building a larger KB; (2') development of a generalmethodology relating the terminology to the corres-pouding conceptual knowledge; (3) expefimeuts withthe role of negation; (4) improvement of thegeneration to ensure more elaborate and coherentoutput combining textual and graphical information.Acknowledgments: We are grateful to the DB-MAT project leader Prof. Dr. Walther yon Halm(Hamburg University) for his support during allproject stages.
