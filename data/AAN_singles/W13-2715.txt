Previous work on multilingualaccess to cultural heritage informa-tion has shown that at least two dif-ferent problems must be dealt withwhen mapping from ontologies to nat-ural language: (1) mapping multilin-gual metadata to interoperable knowl-edge sources; (2) assigning multilin-gual knowledge to cultural data.
Thispaper presents our effort to deal withthese problems.
We describe our expe-riences with processing museum dataextracted from two distinct sources,harmonizing this data and making itscontent accessible in natural language.We extend prior work in two ways.First, we present a grammar-based sys-tem that is designed to generate co-herent texts from Semantic Web on-tologies in 15 languages.
Second, wedescribe how this multilingual systemis exploited to form queries using thestandard query language SPARQL.
Thegeneration and retrieval system buildson W3C standards and is available forfurther research.1 IntroductionAs the amount of cultural data available onthe Semantic Web is expanding (Dekkers etal., 2009; Brugman et al 2008), the demandof accessing this data in multiple languagesis increasing (Stiller and Olensky, 2012).There have been several applications thatapplied Natural Language Generation (NLG)technologies to allow multilingual access toSemantic Web ontologies (Androutsopouloset al 2001; O?Donnell et al 2001; Androut-sopoulos and Karkaletsis, 2005; Androut-sopoulos and Karkaletsis, 2007; Davies, 2009;Bouayad-Agha et al 2012).
The above au-thors have shown it is necessary to havean extensive lexical and syntactic knowl-edge when generating multilingual natu-ral language from Semantic Web ontologies.However, because previous applications aremainly concerned with two or three lan-guages, it is still not clear how to minimizethe efforts in assigning lexical and syntacticknowledge for the purpose of enhancing au-tomatic generation of adequate descriptionsin multiple languages.This paper presents our work on mak-ing Cultural Heritage (CH) content avail-able on the Semantic Web and accessible in15 languages using the Grammatical Frame-work, GF (Ranta, 2011).
The objective ofour work is both to form queries and toretrieve semantic content in multiple lan-guages.
We describe our experiences withprocessing museum data extracted from twodifferent sources, harmonizing this data andmaking its content accessible in natural lan-guage (NL).
The generation and retrieval sys-tem builds on the World Wide Web Consor-tium (W3C) standards and is available forfurther research.1The remainder of this paper is structuredas followed.
We present the related work inSection 2.
We describe the underlying tech-1The generation and retrieval system is availableonline: http://museum.ontotext.com/107nology in Section 3.
We provide a detaileddescription of the data and present the ap-proach taken to make this data accessible inthe Linked Open Data (LOD) in Section 4.
Weoutline the multilingual approach and dis-cuss the challenges we faced in Section 5.We discuss the results in Section 6.
We endwith some conclusions and pointers to futurework in Section 7.2 Related workLately there has been a lot of interest in en-abling multilingual access to cultural her-itage content that is available on the Se-mantic Web.
Androutsopoulos et al(2001)and O?Donnell et al(2001) have shown thataccessing ontology content in multiple lan-guages requires extensive linguistic data as-sociated with the ontology classes and prop-erties.
However, they did not attempt to gen-erate descriptions in real time from a large setof ontologies.Similar to Bouayad-Agha et al(2012), oursystem relies on a multi-layered ontology ap-proach for generating multilingual descrip-tions.
In contrast to Dekkers et al(2009) andBrugman et al(2008) whose systems makeuse of Google translation services, which aredata driven, our system is grammar driven.Moreover, we present a multilingualgrammar-based approach to SPARQL(SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Lan-guage) (Garlik and Andy, 2013).
The methoddiffers from the verbalization methods pre-sented by Ngonga Ngomo et al(2013) andEll et al(2012) in that it realizes the ontologycontent rather than the ontology axioms.Thus providing a more natural realization ofthe query language.3 The technological infrastructureAlthough the architecture of the SemanticWeb and Linked Open Data provides accessto distributed data sets,2 many of the re-sources available in these sets are not accessi-ble because of cross-language meta-data.
Toovercome this limitation, the knowledge rep-resentation infrastructure adopted in our ap-proach is designed as a Reason-able View of2http://linkeddata.orgthe Web of Data.
The Reason-able View is acompound dataset composed of several Re-source Description Frameworks (RDFs).
Toquery such a compound dataset, the user hasto be intimately familiar with the schemataof each single composing dataset.
That iswhy the Reason-able View approach is ex-tended with the so called ontological refer-ence layer, which introduces a unification on-tology, mapped to the schemata of all singledatasets from a given Reason-able View andthus provides a mechanism for efficient ac-cess and navigation of the data.3.1 Museum Reason-able View (MRV)The Museum Reason-able View is an as-sembly of cultural heritage dominated RDFdatasets (Danne?lls et al 2011).
It is loadedinto OWLIM-SE (Bishop et al 2011) with in-ference preformed on the data with respect toOWL Horst (ter Horst, 2005).3.2 The ontological reference layerThe Museum Reason-able View gathers:(a) datasets from LOD, including DBpe-dia;3 (b) the unification ontology PROTON,4an upper-level ontology, consisting of 542classes and 183 properties; (c) two culturalheritage specific ontologies: (i) CIDOC-CRM(Crofts et al 2008),5 consisting of 90 classesand 148 properties; (ii) Museum ArtifactsOntology (MAO),6 developed for mappingbetween museum data and the K-samso?kschema.7 It has 10 classes and 20 properties;(d) the Painting ontology,8 an application on-tology developed to cover detailed informa-tion about painting objects in the framework3DBPedia, structured information from Wikipedia:http://dbpedia.org.4http://www.ontotext.com/proton-ontology5http://www.cidoc-crm.org/6It is just a coincidence that this ontology has thesame name as the Finnish MAO (Hyvyonen et al2008), which also describes museum artifacts for theFinnish museums.7K-samso?k http://www.ksamsok.se/in-english/), the Swedish Open Cultural Her-itage (SOCH), provides a Web service for applicationsto retrieve data from cultural heritage institutions orassociations with cultural heritage information.8http://spraakdata.gu.se/svedd/painting-ontology/painting.owl108of the Semantic Web.
It contains 197 classesand 107 properties of which 24 classes areequivalent to classes from the CIDOC-CRMand 17 properties are sub-properties of theCIDOC-CRM properties.3.3 Grammatical Framework (GF)The Grammatical Framework (GF) (Ranta,2004) is a grammar formalism targeted to-wards parsing and generation.
The key fea-ture of GF is the distinction between an ab-stract syntax, representing the domain, andconcrete syntaxes, representing lineariza-tions in various target languages, natural orformal.GF comes with a resource grammar li-brary (RGL) (Ranta, 2009) which aids thedevelopment of new grammars for specificdomains by providing syntactic operationsfor basic grammatical constructions (Ranta,2011).
More than 30 languages are availablein the RGL.
Our application targets 15 ofthose, including: Bulgarian, Catalan, Dan-ish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, Hebrew,Italian, German, Norwegian, Romanian, Rus-sian, Spanish, and Swedish.4 Cultural heritage dataThe data we have been experimenting withto enable multilingual descriptions of mu-seum objects and answering to queries overthem is a subset of the Gothenburg City Mu-seum (GCM) database,9 and a subset of theDBpedia dataset.
Because these two datasetsare very different in size and nature, the pre-processing of each set differs substantially.
Inthe following we describe each of the sets andthe pre-processing steps in more details.4.1 Gothenburg City Museum (GCM)The set from the GCM contains 48 paintingrecords.
Its content, both the metadata anddata that were originally in Swedish, weretranslated to English.
An example of a recordfrom GCM is shown in Table 1.4.2 DBpediaThe set from DBpedia contains 662 paintingrecords, the data covers at least 5 languages,9http://stadsmuseum.goteborg.se/wps/portal/stadsm/englishRecord field ValueField nr.

An example of arecord from DBpedia is shown in Table 2.4.3 Transition of data to the MRVMaking the museum data available throughthe knowledge infrastructure required trans-lations of the record fields and values, andmapping to a unified ontology.
This processalso required pre-processing of the free textfields such as Description and History (see Ta-ble 1) to enrich the data content.To make the DBpedia data accessiblethrough the knowledge infrastructure, it re-quired some preprocessing, cleaning, andmapping to the Painting ontology for dataconsistency.
This unification was needed touse a consistent SPARQL queries from whereNL descriptions could be generated.Firstly, we attempted to clean data noiseand results that would make a single paint-ing reappear in the query results.
Then, wetransformed year and size strings into onlynumbers.
For each painter, museum andpainting literal we had a single representa-tion in the data.
All names were normalized,for example, Salvador Dal??
was converted109<result><binding name=?painting?><uri>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virgin of the Rocks</uri> </binding><binding name=?museum?><literal xml:lang=?en?>Muse?e du Louvre</literal> </binding><binding name=?author?><literal xml:lang=?en?>da Vinci, Leonardo</literal> </binding><binding name=?height?><literal datatype=?http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int?>190</literal> </binding><binding name=?width?><literal datatype=?http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int?>120</literal>mateva </binding><binding name=?title?><literal xml:lang=?en?>London version</literal> </binding><binding name=?type?><literal xml:lang=?fr?>Huile sur panneau</literal> </binding><binding name=?year?><literal datatype=?http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int?>1495</literal> </binding> </result>Table 2: A painting object representation fromDBpediato Salvador Dal .
For different Uniform Re-source Identifiers (URIs) pointing to the samepainting, we used the OWL (W3C, 2012)construct owl:sameAs.
With this construct wewere able to keep the data linked in the othergraphs in the LOD cloud.5 Multilingual linked dataOur application is targeted towards lay userswho wish to formulate queries and retrieveinformation in any language.
Such users donot have any knowledge about ontologies orsemantic data processing.
For us it was there-fore necessary to enable interactions in a sim-ple use.The work towards making Semantic Webdata accessible to different users requiredlexicalizations of ontology classes, proper-ties and individuals (literal strings associatedwith a certain class).Following the GF mechanism, lexicaliza-tions is accomplished through linearizationsof functions.
Linearization of functions variesdepending on the language.5.1 Lexicalizations of classes andpropertiesMost of the ontology classes defined in ourgrammar are linearized with noun phrasesin the concrete syntaxes.
These were trans-lated manually by a native speaker of thelanguage.
Examples from four languages areshown below.
In the examples we find thefollowing RGL constructions: mkCN (Com-mon noun) and mkN (Noun).Class: PaintingSwe.
mkCN (mkN "ma?lning");Fre.
mkCN (mkN "tableau");Fin.
mkCN (mkN "maalaus");Ger.
mkCN mkN "Bild""Bilder" neuter;Class: PortraitSwe.
mkCN (regGenN "portra?tt"neutrum);Fre.
mkCN (mkN "portrait");Fin.
mkCN (mkN "muoto"(mkN "kuva"));Ger.
mkCN (mkN "Portra?t""Portra?ts" neuter);Two of the ontology classes that are notlinearized with a noun phrase are: Year andSize.
These are linearized with prepositionalphrases in which the preposition is languagedependent.
Below are some examples whichshow how the Year string, i.e.
YInt function, isrealized in six languages.
In the examples wefind the following RGL constructions: mkAdv(Verb Phrase modifying adverb), Prep (Prepo-sition) and symb (Symbolic).Bul.
YInt i = mkAdv prez_Prep(symb (i.s ++ year_Str));Fin.
YInt i = mkAdv (prePrepnominative "vuonna") (symb i);Fre.
YInt i = mkAdv en_Prep (symb i);Ger.
YInt i = mkAdv in_Prep (symb i);Swe.
YInt i = mkAdv noPrep(symb ("a?r" ++ i.s));Rus.
YInt i = mkAdv in_Prep(symb (i.s ++ godu_Str));The ontology properties are defined withoperations in the concrete syntaxes.
Because110Table 3: The amount of lexicalized literals in asubset of the MRVClass literalsTitle 662Painter 116Museum 104Place 22an ontology property is linearized differentlydepending on how it is realized in the targetlanguage, these operations are of type: verbs(e.g.
paint V2), adverbs (e.g.
painted A) andprepositions (e.g.
Prep).
Examples from threelanguages are shown below.Swe.
paint_V2 : V2 = mkV2 "ma?la";painted_A : A = mkA "ma?lad";at_Prep = mkPrep "pa?"
;Fin.
paint_V2 = mkV2 "maalata";painted_A = mkA "maalattu";Ger.
paint_V2 : V2 = mkV2(mkV "malen");painted_A : A = mkA "gemalt";at_Prep = in_Prep ;The above functions correspond to threeontological properties, namely painted by,painted and created in.
This approach to ontol-ogy lexicalization permits variations regard-ing the lexical units the ontology propertiesshould be mapped to.
It allows to make prin-cipled choices about the different realizationsof an ontology property.5.2 Lexicalizations of literalsThe part of the MRV to which we providetranslations for consists of 906 individuals,their distribution across four classes is pro-vided in Table 3.
The lexical units assigned topaining titles, painters and museum literalsare by default the original strings as they ap-pear in the data.
The majority of strings aregiven in English.
However, because withouttranslations of the name entities the resultscan become artificial and for some languagesungrammatical, we run a script that trans-lates museum literals from Wikipedia auto-matically.Automatic translation was done by:(1) curling for Web pages for a museumstring; (2) extracting the retrieved trans-Table 4: The number of automatically translatedmuseum names from WikipediaLanguage Translated namesBulgarian 26Catalan 63Danish 33Dutch 81Finnish 40French 94Hebrew 46Italian 94German 99Norwegian 50Romanian 27Russian 87Spanish 89Swedish 58lated entry for each string; (3) reducingthe retrieved list by removing duplicatedand ambiguous entries.
This process wasrepeated for each language.As a result of the translation process, alist of lexical pairs was created for each lan-guage.
Museum literals were then linearizedautomatically by consulting the created listfor each language.
In the cases where notranslation was found, the original string, asit appears in the dataset was used.Unfortunately, the amount of the trans-lated museum names was not equal for alllanguages.
The distribution of the translatednames is given in Table 4.
Below follow someexamples of how museum names are repre-sented in the grammar:Swe.
MGothenburg_City_Museum =mkMuseum "Go?teborgs stadsmuseum";MMus_e_du_Louvre =mkMuseum "Louvren";Ita.
MGothenburg_City_Museum =mkMuseum"museo municipale di Goteburgo";MMus_e_du_Louvre =mkMuseum "Museo del Louvre";Fre.
MGothenburg_City_Museum =mkMuseum"muse?e municipal de Go?teborg";MMus_e_du_Louvre =mkMuseum "Muse?e du Louvre";Cat.
MGothenburg_City_Museum =mkMuseum "Gothenburg_City_Museum";MMus_e_du_Louvre =111mkMuseum "Museu del Louvre";Ger.
MGothenburg_City_Museum =mkMuseum "Gothenburg_City_Museum";MMus_e_du_Louvre =mkMuseum "Der Louvre ";Where the construct mkMuseum has beendefined to build a noun phrase from a givenstring.
A special case of mkMuseum appearsin four languages: Italian, Catalan, Spanishand French, where a masculine gender is as-signed to the museum string to get the cor-rect inflection form of the noun.5.3 Realization of sentencesTo generate sentences from a set of classeswe had to make different judgements abouthow to order the different classes.
Below weprovide an example of a sentence lineariza-tion from four languages.
The sentence com-prises four semantic classes: Painting, Mate-rial, Painter and Year.
In the examples we findfollowing RGL constructors: mkText (Text),mkS (Sentence), mkCl (Clause), mkNP (NounPhrase), and mkVP (Verb Phrase).Ita.
s1 : Text = mkText (mkS(mkCl painting (mkVP (mkVP (mkVP(mkVP dipinto_A) material.s)(SyntaxIta.mkAdv by8agent_Prep(title painter.long))) year.s))) ;Fre.
s1 : Text = mkText(mkS anteriorAnt(mkCl painting (mkVP (mkVP (mkVP(passiveVP paint_V2) material.s)(SyntaxFre.mkAdv by8agent_Prep(title painter.long))) year.s))) ;Ger.
s1 : Text = mkText(mkS pastTense(mkCl painting (mkVP (mkVP(mkVP (passiveVP paint_V2) year.s)(SyntaxGer.mkAdv von_Prep(title painter.long))) material.s)));Rus.
s1 : Text = mkText(mkS pastTense(mkCl painting (mkVP (mkVP (mkVP(passiveVP paint_V2)(SyntaxRus.mkAdv part_Prep(title painter.longmasculine animate)))material.s) year.s))) ;Some of the distinguishing differences be-tween the languages are: in Finnish the useof an active voice, in Italian, present tense,in French, past participle, in Spanish, presentsimple.
The order of the categories is also dif-ferent.
In German the material string appearsat the end of the sentence as opposed to theother languages where year is often the laststring.5.4 Realizations of textsThe text grammar has been designed to gen-erate a coherent natural language descrip-tions from a selected set of the returnedtriples.
More specifically, our grammar cov-ers eight concepts that are most commonlyused to describe a painting, including: Title,Painter, Painting type, Material, Colour, Year,Museum and Size.
In the grammar mod-ule called TextPainting they are defined ascategories and are captured in one functionDPainting which has the following represen-tation in the abstract syntax.DPainting :Painting -> Painter ->PaintingType -> OptColours ->OptSize -> OptMaterial ->OptYear -> OptMuseum -> Description;In the function DPainting five argumentshave been implemented as optional, i.e.OptColour, OptSize, OptMaterial, OptYear andOptMuseum.
Each of these categories can beleft out in a text.In the current implementation we limitedthe length of a description to three sentences.A minimal description consists of only onesentences.
Below follow some examples oftexts generated in English to exemplify thedifferent descriptions we are able to generatefrom one single function call with a varyingnumber of instantiated parameters.?

As a con-sequence, to retrieve semantic content fromthe knowledge base the user must: 1. mas-ter SPARQL, the query language for RDF;2. have knowledge about each integrateddataset in the knowledge base.Ngonga Ngomo et al(2013) have shownthat realizations of SPARQL queries in natu-ral language enhance the user understandingof the formulated queries and the retrievedresults.We have implemented an extra SPARQLmodule that allow us to map from anyof the 15 supported languages to SPARQLand from SPARQL to any of the 15 sup-ported languages.
The grammar reuses amore generic query module that allows toform both domain specific and domain in-dependent queries.
Some examples of thequeries that can be formulated with themultilingual grammar and transformed toSPARQL are:1.
Some X2.
All About X3.
Show everything about X4.
All X painted by Y5.
Some X painted on Y6.
What is the material of X7.
Show everything about all X that are paintedon YIn GF, realization of SPARQL queries isdone by introducing new parameters, for ex-ample:QPainter p = {wh1 = "?author";prop = p ;wh2 ="painting:createdBy ?painter.
?painter rdfs:label ?author ."}
;The function QPainter defined to formulatea query such as who painted Mona Lisa?
hasbeen added two additional parameters, i.e.wh1 and wh2.
With these parameters it is pos-sible to formulate SPARQL queries such asthe one below.SELECT ?authorWHERE {?painting rdf:typepainting:Painting ;painting:createdBy ?painter ;rdfs:label ?titleFILTER (str(?title)="Mona_Lisa").
?painter rdfs:label ?author.
}113Figure 2: Multilingual generation results5.6 Multilingual text generationOur approach allows different texts to begenerated depending on the information thatis available in the ontology.
A minimal de-scription consists of three classes: a title, apainter and a painting type.
A complete de-scription consists of nine classes, as illus-trated in Figure 1.
With only one functionDPainting our system is able to generate 16different text variants.
Figure 2 illustrates ageneration results in 15 languages.6 DiscussionThe majority of the challenges in the produc-tion of the CH data pool stemmed from thevery nature of the Linked Open Data.
Thedata in the LOD cloud are notoriously noisyand inconsistent.The multilingual labels from the FactForgedatasets and more precisely from DBpedia,are not always available in all the supportedlanguages.
Although DBpedia in its largepool of data provides access to multilingualcontent, it is inconsistent.
Many of the entriesit contains are missing translations.
There is amixture of numeric and string literals.
Thereare many duplications, most of them occurbecause the same ID appears in different lan-guages.
The content of the data is verbose, forexample place-names and museum-namesare represented with one string, for example:?Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam?, instead of twodifferent strings linked by two separate con-cepts, i.e.
Museum and Place.
This kind of in-consistent data representation had an impacton the translation of museum names.Another problem was that not all art ob-jects are uniformly described with the sameset of characteristics.
For instance, somepaintings were missing a title or a paintername.
Because we constructed the grammarin such a way that disallows absence of thisinformation, we had to replace titles withid numbers and empty painter names withthe string unknown.
Moreover, the data con-tained many duplications.
This occurred be-cause some of the property assertions werepresented with different strings and trig-gered many RDF triples.We also faced many linguistic challengeson different levels.
Lexicalizations of ontol-ogy classes and properties regarding useof compounds, variations of verbs, adverbsand prepositions.
On sentence level, order ofclasses, variations of tense and voice.
On bothsentence and discourse levels, aggregationvariations and use of coreference elements.7 ConclusionsWe presented an ontology-based multilin-gual application developed in the Gram-matical Framework and a cross-language re-trieval system that uses this application forgenerating museum object descriptions inthe Semantic Web.The generation and retrieval system buildson W3C standards.
It covers semantic datafrom the Gothenburg City Museum databaseand DBpedia.
The grammar enables descrip-tions of paintings and answering to queriesover them, covering 15 languages for base-line functionality.114AcknowledgmentThis research has been supported byMOLTO, the European Union?s SeventhFramework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)under grant agreement FP7-ICT-247914.ReferencesS.
