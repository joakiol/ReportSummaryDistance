Zero Anaphors in Chinese Discourse ProcessingChin -Chuan ChengC i ty  Un ivers i ty  of  Hong Kongc tcheng@ci tyu .edu .hkAbst rac tIn Chinese, zero anaphors occur frequently.
This talk discussesseveral issues in identification of zero anaphors.
Syntactic tagging ofwords in a running text for detection of anaphora requires pecificationof argument structure for verbal elements.
Verbs requiring a subject oran object can be used to locate the position of zero anaphors.
Typicalargument structures for verbs, however, often do not take into accountthe expansion of the structure in discourse such as placing the instru-ment in object position.
Once the place of a zero anaphor is located,the discourse processor will attempt o recover the entity.
There maybe more than one entity in the previous context hat can fit in theargument structure of the verb.
It has been discussed in the literaturethat the recovery of zero anaphors requires extra-linguistic knowledge.However, I will discuss two recovery principles that utilize linguisticinformation as given in the text.
The opening statement of a topiccontinuity normally provides the element for ellipsis in the statementsthat follow.
So the first principle is to return to the opening statementfor recovery.
Perceptive verbs, on the other hand, often trigger thesearch of anaphors in the most recent element.
This recency principlecan be broken by certain adverbial expressions that mark the turn ofthe event.
These principles apply within a topic continuity.
The sizeof a topic continuity is empirically determined to be about 50 wordswith some variation.146
