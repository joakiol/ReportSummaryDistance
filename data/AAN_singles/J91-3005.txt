Erratum to: A Statistical Approach toMachine TranslationPeter E BrownStephen A. Della PietraFredrick JelinekRobert L. MercerJohn CockeVincent J. Della PietraJohn D. LaffertyPaul S. RoossinIn Section 6 of "A statistical approach to machine translation" (Computational Linguis-tics 16(2), 79-85), we reported the results of two experiments in which we estimatedparameters of a statistical model of translation from English to French.In the first experiment, he English and French vocabularies each consisted of9,000 common words, and the model parameters were estimated from 40,000 pairs ofsentences 25 words or less in length.
Words outside the 9,000-word vocabularies inthese sentences were mapped to special unknown words.In the second experiment, the vocabularies were limited to 1,000 common Englishwords and 1,700 common French words, and the model parameters were estimatedfrom 117,000 pairs of sentences 10 words or less in length that were completely coveredby the respective vocabularies.In Figures 4, 5, and 6 of the paper, we erroneously presented parameter estimatesfrom the 1,000-word experiment, while claiming in the text that they were from the9,000-word experiment.
The parameter stimates for these two experiments differ con-siderably because of the restriction of the training corpus in the 1,000-word experimentto short, covered sentences.

This difference is due to the factthat the sentence pair (Hear, hear!
\[ Bravo!)
is extremely common in our data and iscompletely covered by the 1,000-word and 1,700-word vocabularies.Figures 4, 5, and 6 contain the parameter estimates from the 9,000-word experi-ment.
Only probabilities greater than or equal to .01 are reported.1 We thank Ken Church for pointing out that this estimate is not consistent with the frequency withwhich hear translates to bravo in other data from the same source.326
