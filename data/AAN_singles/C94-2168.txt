A ims  o f  the  pro jec tThe general aim of our project is to improve the qualityof existing systems extracting knowledge from texts byintroducing refined lexical semantics data.
Theconlribution of lexical ~mantics to knowledge xtractionis not new and has already been demonstrated in a fewsystems.
Our more precise aims are to:- propose and show feasability of more radical semanticclassifications which facilitate lexical descriptions byfactoring out as much information as possible,enhancing re-usability of linguistic ressources.
Weshow how the different linguistic ressources can beorg~mized and how they interact,- investigate different levels of granularity in thesemantic descriptions and their impact on the quality ofthe extracted knowledge.
In our system, granularity isconsidered at two levels: (1) linguistic: linguisticknowledge representations may be more or less precise,(2) functional: most modules of our system can workindependently and thus can be used ~pamtely,- evaluate different algorithms for extracting knowledge,taking into account efficiency aspects,- evaluate the costs of extending our system to largersets of texts anti to differeut application domains.Our prqiect is applied to research projects descriptions(noted hereafter as RPD) where the annual work ofresearchers atthe DER of EDF (Direction des Etudes etdes Rechcrches, Electricit6 de France) is described interms of research actions.
The extracted knowledge mustbe sufficiently accurate to allow for the realization of thefollowing Imrposes: (1) evaluation of the importance ofthe use of techniques, procedures anti equipments, (2)automatic distribution of documents in different services,(3) interrogation, e.g.
who does what anti what kind ofresults are available, (4) identification of relations ofvarious types between projects, (5) construction ofsynthesis of research activities on precise topics, and (6)creation of the 'history' of a project.About 2.000 RPD are produced each year, each of about200 words hmg.
The total vocabulary is about 50.000different words.
Texts include fairly complex linguisticconstructs.
We also use the EDF thesaurus (encoding fornouns: taxonomies, associative relations, and synonyms,in a broad sense).In this document, we first introduce the linguisticorganization of our project, present the general form oftexts and identify the type of information which mnst beextracted out of them.
Next, we present a semanticrepresentation for the extracted knowlexlge, and study inmore depth the extraction of information under the formof predicate-argument andpredicate-modifier st uctures(Jackendoff 87a, Ka~ and Fodor 63).2.
The  overa l l  o rgan izat ion  of  thel ingu is t i c  sys temLet us first introduce the way linguistic knowledge isorganized.
Due to space limitation, we just outline themain elements of the system, tiere are the differentlinguistic omponents of our system:surface forms: | detemfines basic syntactic Thematic Roles :1~ ~ + selec, restrictionslfead - form~ and prepositionsComplements,1~ detenuines| c*,~lnplexI syntactic| behavior/ (alternations)\[ according to/ general\] granmmtical\[ l)rincil )lestyping rok;s \] of solne derived fromB conceptual \[ argum-representa- I ents \] of \],CS tions ~ rept.Verb Semantic \] I,CSClasst~s(B.

priinitivt~s .Fig.
t The General l,inguistic OrganizalionThematic roles (Dowty 89), (Dowty 91) paired withselectional restrictions and semantic information allowfor the production or recognition of surface formscorresponding to 'b,'ksie' sentential forms.
More complexforms will be treated by a system of alternations, derivedfrom the semantic lassification of verbs defined by(l,evin 93).In our approach, we consider a set of primitiveelements, either general or related to our applicationdomain, which includes notions uch as being in contactwith, being in spatial motion, or being the cause of.This set of primitives is designed so that it correspondsto those needed for the definition of the semantic lassesof verbs, where the syntactic behavior of a verb (and thusthe different ways the ,arguments can be distributed andshould be analysed by the parser and put at the right placein the semantic representation) essentially depends on theverb's emantic nature.
This approach allows for a reallycomprehensive tr atment ofpredicate-argument structuresbecause it complements he basic syntactic mappingsrealized from thematic roles specifications.
Furthermore,this approach requires very economical lexical means10.
'39since it removes a lot of idiosyncracies previouslyencoded in lexical entries.We are reformulating B. Levin's work for a subset ofverbs of French.
Although our study is quite general, wefocus primarily on verbs found in applications.
Verbs ofa given class have almost identical thematic distributionswhich are predictable from their semantics.
For each ofthe semantic lasses we have considered, we have defineda relatively small set of thematic grids, which define the'regular' thematic distributions.From a different perspective, we also consider that asubset of the semantic primitives we have identified arethose used in the LCS, which we use in a slightlysimplified way, since we do not consider for ourapplication its deepest refinements.
The efficient use ofLCS for practical applications has been shown in anumber of works, including (Dorr 93).3.
Semantic typology of  the RPD textsLet us first illustrate the type of text we are dealingwith.
Here is a standard text:"Los mesures destructives (ou assimilables) posenttoujours des probl~mes concernant le faible nombre dedonn6es disponibles ou encore leur coot qui s'associegan6ralement ~ la nacessita d'une bonne pracision.

"3.1 General organization of textsA global study of these texts shows a great regularityin their overall organization.
We have identified fourmajor facets in most texts, called articulations.
Thesearticulations are not necessarily present altogether in atext.
We have the following articulations:- THEME, which characterizes the main purpose of thetext.
This articulation includes the topic of the text, andthe domain on which engineers are investigating,- MOTIVATIONS, which relate the main objectives, theneeds, the goals and which explains the development ofthe current project.- PROBLEMS, which correspond to the difficultiesrelated to the current state of the art or to the limitationsof certain equipments or methods.- REALIZATIONS, which describe the different asksrequired for the achievement of the project.Articulations may cover one or more fragments of asentence, a whole sentence or a set of sentences.
They donot necessarily appear in the order they have been definedhere.
The decomposition of texts in articulations definesthe pragmat ic  level.
We view the articulations asdefining semantic fields.
The above text can bedecomposed asfollows:\[t h e m e lies mosuros destructives\] \],\ [mot ivat ion , ,  \[optimisor los campagnes de mesurepour mieux analyser les incertitudes de mesure, et,Iorsque cela est possible, reduire les coots induits.\] \],\[problems \[\[posent toujours des problemesconcernant le fatble hombre de donn~es disponibles ouencore leur coot qui s'associe generalement ~.
lanecessit~ d'une bonne precision\], \[probl~mes sentd'autant plus difficiles gt traiter que les param~tres en jeuont des comportements non-lin~aires.\] \],\ [ real izat ions \[~tudier les m~thodes permettant deprendre en compte cette non-lin~arit~.\]\]\].For this level, we have implemented a method whichpermits the identification of the different articulations ofa text.
This problem is divided into two sub-problems:(1) identification of the articulations, and (2) extraction ofrelevant sentence fragments from the original text.A study of the RPD texts has shown that these fourarticulations can relatively easily be identified by meansof specific terms or constructions.
Let us call these termsor constructions articulation triggers.
Articulationtriggers belong to different linguistic domains:(1) lexical, where triggers are just words, e.g.
'devotedto', 'in the context of', 'propose', for THEME,(2) grammatical, where triggers can be phrases, orrelated to grammatical information (such as tense andaspect, e.g.
'in the past years', 'since 1989', forTHEME), or verbs or nouns of certain semantic lass,e.g.
verbs of volition, of creation (Levin 93),(3) discursive, where triggers are mainly propositionalconnectors such as 'therefore', 'because', etc.,(4) pragmatic, where the relative positions of sentencesand more generally, the physical form of texts (e.g.enumerations) can determine articulations.The next stage is to extract those portions of textwhich are relevant for the articulation considered.
Sincethe linguistic treatements of this first level arenecessarily superficial, we must carefully discardirrelevant portions of texts.
This approach has beenmodelled by means of extraction rules, which specifywords and constructions toskip and which delimit zonesof texts to be extracted.
Evaluation of results is given infig.
2 in the annex.3.2 Identification of knowledge to beextractedLet us now concentrate on the nature of the semanticinformation which should be extracted by the system.
Wehave identified three types of information:- general nominal terms (e.g.
'methods', data'), andspecific nominal terms belonging to technical domains,- states or actions in which these terms are involved,- general roles played by these terms in actions orstates.Roughly speaking, the first class identifies arguments,the second class defines predicates, while the third oneintroduces the notion of semantic roles such as thematicroles.
This latter level is of a crucial importance inknowledge xtraction because it avoids making incorrectinterpretations on the role of an argument with respect othe action or slate being described.
This level is calledthe linguistic level.The level of granularity we are considering in thisproject suggests t,s to group predicates with a close1040meaning into a class and to represent them by the samepredicate name, viewed as a primitive term.
For example,we have terms which express the notion of definition(e.g.
define, specify, describe, identify, qualify, represent)or the notion of building (e.g.
assemble, build, compile,develop, forge) as defined in B. Leviu's work.
Howcver,for a relatively small number of classes, in particular forthose classes of predicates which denote complex actionsand for those which exhibit a high degrcc ofincorporation (Baker 88), where incorporated knowledgeneeds to be made more explicit, it may be necessary touse a more conceptual type of representation.
We wantto investigate the use the Lexical Conccptual Structures(LCS) (Jackendoff 87, 90) whicln match very well withthe planned uses of the extracted knowledge on the onehand, and with the notion of thematic roles on the otherhand.
Let us call it the conceptual  level.
This paperbeing mainly devoted to the linguistic levcl, this levelwill not be investigated here.4.
The  l ingu is t i c  level4.1 Identification of predicative termsPredicative terms characterize states or actions.
The goalat this stage is to be able to determine in a way which isas systematic as possible which terms are predicative inthe RPD texts.
A priori, verbs denoting states or actionsand prepositions are considered to be predicative terms.Nouns are slightly more difficult to treat.
The EDFdictionary includes the specification of nouns derivedfrom verbs.
We consider that these nouns are predicative.A few nouns, not derived from verbs are also predicative,such as algorithm, sort or departure, these are identifiedso far by hand.
They may be later semantically classifiedas describing, for example, actions or evenls.4.2 Identi f icat ion of re levant predicates andarguments in textsThe second aspect of the linguistic level is theidentification of predicates and related argmnents whicharc sufficiently relevant to be extracted.
Relevance can bedefined a priori and once for all or may depend on thetext.
The relevance of a term can be defined according toseveral criteria:(1) genericity, terms defining a research action, arealization, or a problem such as: define, improve,implement, test, evaluate and explore are of muchinterest.
At this level, it is most useful to use B.Levin's verb classification to determine relevance.
(2) specialization, corresponding to very precise termsdescribing a material, an equipment, a method or asystem.
Specialized terms can be defined a priori fromthe thesaurus by extracting the most stx~cialized terms.
(3) localimportance, where importance in a text isexplicitly marked, for example, by a construction suchas 'it is important to...' or by a negation.4.3 Represent ing predicate a rguments  andmodifiers by means of thematic rolesThe relationship between a predicate and one of itsarguments can be represented by a thematic role.Thematic roles do confer a much stronger meaning topredicate structures, in particular when thenmtic roleshave a relatively preci~ meaning.
Thematic roles c~m bedefined in a more refincd way than the usual definitions.From that perspective, our claim is that thematic rolescan form the basis of a good and stable generaldescriptive semantics of prc~licate-~u'gument r lationships.Thematic roles have then a conceptual dimension, andnot only a linguistic one.
However, they must not beconfused with the conceptual abels of the LCS.Thematic roles must remain general; they form a bridgebetween conceptual representations and syntax.
Fig.
3shows the thematic roles we consider.We consider here an extended use of thematic rolessince they are also assigned to predicate modifiers,realized as prepositional phrases or as propositions, inorder to represent in a more explicit and uniform wayessential arguments and modifiers, since they all play animportant role in the semantics of a proposition.The general form of a semantic representationintroduces two functions for thematic roles:(1) an argument typing function:predicate_name( .... ~ i :  {argi } .
.
.
.
)(2) a predicate mochfier typing function, where a prod icateis marked by a thematic role, if the modifier is apredicate:r_gJg_l j : predicate_name( .... r__0~l k : \[arg k } .. .
.
)The arg i are fragments of texts (NPs and PPs), whichmay be further analyzed in a similar way, if necessary.
}"or exanlple, a sentence such as:John got injured by changing a wheelis represented by:injured h(.t.h.e._m~ : {john}) ^  causal theme :change( itg~_nJ,: {john} , ~ : {wheel}).If in an articulation, we only extract an NP, it isrepresented asan argument as fi)llows:arg( { fragments of text corresponding tothe NP }).and uo thematic role is assigned to it.
The generalrepresentation f an articulation is tben:\ [art iculat ion_name,\[extracted text from pragmatic level\],partial predicate-arg epresenlatkm\]The result of the parse of our sample text is given below.\[\[ t h e m e \[los mesures destructives (ou assimilables)\]arg: {mesures destructives} \] ,\[ mot ivat ions  \[optimiser los carnpagnes de mesurepour mieux connaitre, voire ameliorer, los incertitudes demesure, et, Iorsque cela est possible, reduire les cootsinduits.\]opdmi~( _ ,  Incremental beneficiary theme:{campagnes dexnesure}) ^'(g~2: (analyze( _ ,  holistic theme:{incerlitudes de mesare}) ^reduce(__,incremenlal victim theme:{cofits})) \ ] ,\[ p rob!ems \[\[posent toujours des problemesconcernant le faible hombre de donnees disponibles ouencore leur coot qui s'associe generalement gt lanecessita d'une bonne precision.\] \[problhmes sentd'autant plus difficiles ~t traiter que les parametres en1041jou ont des comportements non-lineaires.\]arg: ( { faible nombre de donnE~s}, {cofit},{comportements non-lintaires}) \] ,\[ rea l i za t ions  \[6tudier los m6thodes permettant deprendre en compte cette nonqin6arite.\]study(_, general theme: {methods} ) \]\].4.4 Parsing and assigning thematic rolesLet us now show how our parser works and howthematic roles are concretely assigned to ,arguments.
Forthat purpose, we introduce three main criteria:(1) the semantic lass of the predicative term wherethematic grids are given,(2) the semantic type of the preposition, if any, whichintroduces the argument, we also have defined thematicgrids for prepositions,(3) the general semantic type of the head noun of theargument NP.
Semantic types are mainly defined fromthe semantic fields given in the EDF thesaurus.These criteria re summarized infig.
4 at the end of thisdocument.
These criteria re implemented by means ofthematic role assignment rides.The parsing of the RPD texts works independently oneach fragment of text associated with each articulation(referencial spects will be considered later).
We have thethree following stages:(1) Identification ofpredicates and arguments: due to thecomplexity of texts, a partial analysis is the onlypossible and efficient solution.
We have a grammar thatidentifies basic verbal constructions, nominalconstructions.
The parser works bottom-up andidentifies maximal structures which are not ambiguous.
(2) Thematic role assignement: The assignmentprocedure considers each thematic role in a thematic gridand searches for a nominal or propositional structure towhich the thematic role can be assigned.
Thisassignment is based on the thematic role assignementrules.
The general form of a thematic role assignmentrule is the following:assign_role(<name of role>,<grammatical form of predicate>,<grammatical form of argument>) :- <unification orsubsumption constraints on semantic features>.This is illustrated as follows, where grammatical forms(xp) are given in Login form (A'R-Kaqi and Nasr 86),following the TFS approach:assign_role(effective_agent,xp(syntax => syn(cat => v), semantics =>sem( pred => yes, relevance => yes)),xp(syntax => syn(cat => n), semantics =>sem( pred => no,sere_type => tsem( semp => X )))) :-subsumed(X, \[human, technical\]).This process can be applied recursively on thosearguments which contain predicates.
The depth ofrecursion is a parameter ofthe system.
(3) Semantic representation construction.
At this level,deeper representations (such as the LCS) can be used.Conc lus ionThe novelty of our approach with respect to knowledgeextraction can be summarized asfollows:(1) We have defined three levels of knowledgerepresentation (pragmatic, linguistic and conceptual),which are homogeneous, expressed within a single,incremental formalism, incremental in the sense thatknowledge extracted atan outer level is refined at a deeperone, and that representations support partial information.
(2) We have defined simple methods for extractingrelevant tern~ in texts, using a thesaurus.
(3) We show that the syntactic alternations given inLevin's work complement the basic syntactic formsgenerated from thematic roles.
These semantic lasses ofverbs, because of their semautic basis and because of theway they are defined are a very powerful tool forassigning correctly thematic roles to predicate argumentin a large number of syntactic forms.
(4) The different types of data and the level of granularityat which they are considered establishes linguistic levelsof descriptions which correspond to a certain descriptivereality anti to a certain autonomous and homogeneouslevel of semantic representation.AcknowledgementsWe are very grateful to Marie-Luce Herviou, PahniraMarrafa and Sophie Daub~ze for discussions on thisproject.
