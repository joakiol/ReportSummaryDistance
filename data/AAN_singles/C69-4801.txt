CONTEXTUAL GRAMMARS- Solomon Marcus -InsUtutul de MatematicaStr, Mihal Eminescuo 47BuchareSt 9, ROMANIAIn the following, we shall introduce a type of generativegrammars, called contextual grammars.
They are not comparablewith regular grammars- But every language generated by a con-textual grammar is a context-?ree language.
Generalized con-textual grammars are introduced, which may generate non-cox,-text-free languages.Let V be a finite non-void set ; Vlary.
Every finite sequence of elements inia called a vocnbu-V is said to be as t r ing  on  V. G iven  a s t r ing  x = a la2 .

Any set  o f  s t r ings  on Vi s  ca l led  a language on  V. The set  o f  a l l  s t r ings  on V ( thenu l l - s t r ing  inc lus ive ly ) i s  ca l led  the  un iversa l  language on  V.By a n- we denote the string a...a, where a is iterated ntimes.Any ordered pair (u,v~ of strings on V_ is said to be acontex~ on V. The string x is admitted by the context<u,v> With respect to the language L if u~ G L.Let .~  be a finite set of strings on the vocabulary V~and le t@be a finite se@ of contexts on V. The triple(v,~, ~)) (1)is said to be a contextual l~rammar ; V is the vocabulary ofthe grammar, ~ is the ba_s_e_ of the grammar and ~ is  the co  m~,--2 -textual ccmoonent of the grammar.Let us denote by ~ the contextual grammar defined by(1).

Eyer~ finite language is a cont~ua l  lan-Proo__f.
Let V be a vocabulary and let ~ be a finite lan.guage on V. It is obvious that the contextual grammar (V,L4jO),where 9 dauotes the void set of contexts, gauerates the lan-guage L I.
The same language may be gamerated by means of the.g ?

If we put, in the proof Of Proposition 2, L I -Vinstead of h =~'  then the grammar (V_ ,h ,@)  does not ge-nerate the universal language on V, since the language it ge-nerates dDes not contain the nu/l-strlng.In order to illustrate the activity of the grammar (V ,~,~def ined  in the of let consider the proof proposition 2, USparticular case when the vocabulary iS formed by two elementsonly : V =(a .b~.

In order to generate the stringx, we start with the null.string @@ and we apply i l  times thecontext ~ ,a~ .

The language of Curry is a contextual lan-gu~eoproof.
The considered language is generated by the grammar(V ,L I ,~)  , where V= ~a.b~ , I~ =~a 3 -nd~ ~<~,b~.We recall that a language is Said to be regular if it maybe generated by means of a finite aatoma$on (or, equivalently,by means of a finite state grammar in the sense of Ohomsky).Proposition 4.
There exis$~ a contextual language which isProof.
Let us consider the language L = ~a-nb n} (n=l,2,...)If we put V = {a?b} , L 1 = ~ab~ and ~ ~<a.b>} , then it iseasy to see that L is  generated by the con~extuai grammar (V,LI, ~ .
On the other hand, L is n~t a regular language.
Thisfact was assel~ed by Ghomsky in \[3~ and\[~\],  but the proof hegives is wrong.
A correct proof of this assertion and a.discus-sion of Chomsky' s proof were given in \[~\].
and ~.Propositions 2,3 and # show that there are many infinitelanguages w~ioh are oontextual.
This fact may be explained bymeans ofP~posi~ion 5.
If the set ~ is non-void and if the set~contains at least one non-nu/1 contex~ I ~hen the contextual gram-ma___r_r (V.Ll, ~ ~enerate s an infinite language.Proof.

Thus, ~his language is infinite.The converse of Proposition 5 is true.
Indeed, we have//-5 -Proposition 6.
If the contextual 6rammar (V, L I~  gau~rates an infillite language, then ~Ll.

Let L be the language generated by ~V)L I~.
I fis void, L is void too, hence it cannot be infinite.
Ifcontains no non-null context, we have L = L I.
But ~d is in anyease flni~e ; ~hus, L is finite, in contradictiom With the h vpo-thesis.Since there are contextual language which are not regular(see Proposition 4 above), it would be interesting to  establishwhether all contextual languages are context-free ls~guages.
Theamswer is affirmative :Proposition 7.

Let b be a contextual language.
If L is finite,it is a regular language.
But i~ is well knowm that every regu-lar language is a context-free language.
Therefore, L is acontext-free language.
Nowe let us suppose that L is infinite.Deao~e by G = (V,,L l, a contextual grammar which generatesthe language L, In view of Proposition 6, L I is non-void,whe-ream there exists an integer i, l~ i~p  , such that the con-~ext ~ui,vi~ is non-nu~ Joe.

The terminal vocabulary of ~ is V. The non-terminal vocabulary of ~ contains one element only- denoted byS - which is, of course, the axiom of the grammar ~ .

Among the non-terminal rules, there is one at least which is non-trivial : itis the rule S ---> UiS v~.

The ge-neral form of this generation involves sev(ral consecutive ap-plications of non-terminal rules (the number of these applica-tions may be eventually equal to zero) followed by one and onlyone application of a terminal rule.
It is easy to see that theresult of this generation ?

For instance, ~he l~-~uage of K leene~an~ (m=~,2,...), the first example of an infinitelanguage which is not regular, is a very simple example of ~contextual language.

Indeed, we haveProoositiou 8.
There exists a. cont e.~-free language which isnot a contextual language.Proof.
Let V = ~a,b~.
In view of a theorem of Gru~Lkl ~~__.-----~there exists, for every positive integer _n~ a context-freelanguage I~ on V, such that every context-free grammar of I~contains at least n non-terminal symbols.
But, as we can see inthe proof of Proposition 7, every contextual language may be gene-rated with a context-free grammar containing only one non-~erminalsymbol.
Therefore, if _n ~ 2, ~ is not a contex~usl l~guage.Proposition 8 suggests the natural question whe~bsr ~bereexist regular languages which are not contextual lan~ages.
The?I-9 -answer is affirmative :Pronosition 9- There exists a regular language which is not acontext ual language.Proof~ Let us consider the laugaage L = {abm-~c~a.~ n,) ~ ,n==1,2,...), which was used b~ H.B.Curry \ [5 \ ] ,  in order to  descrlbethe set of mathematical (true or not) propositions.

This means that ul,~2,.... ?
----,_Un , Vl,Y2,-..,v ~ in the expression (3) are formed only bythose elements of V whnse number of occurences in the strings ofL is unlimited.
Only h satisfies this requirement.
It followsthat in any string of .L both occurrences of sand  the occurenceof ~ are terms of the string x in (3).
But this implies thatthe intermediate terms between the occurrences of a are termsof x, hence we can f ind two strings y and, m lThe string y is obvioasly .the null-string ~othe  fo rm 1~.

Therefore, since- l o -X6~ , it follows that ~ is an infinite se~ of mtrimgs.
Thisfact contradicts the assus~tion concern_tug G !
v, is ~t  a con-textual language and Proposition 9 is proved.The contextual grammars may be generalized in order to ge-nerate some lauguages which are not context-free.A generalized contextual ~r~mmar is a quadruple G =~ ,,L2, ~ , where V, L I and ~have  the same mea l~g as inbhe definition of a contextual grammar, whereas J'2 is a finiteset of strings on the vocabulary V .
We define the language L Ggenerabed by G in the following way : Y~ is a language on Va~d xe~ if and only if we may e~press x in the form.

We may consider the language L = ~sbmc_abn-} (~,n==1,2,...) used in the proof of Proposition 9.
It was showed inthe proof of Proposition 9 that L is regular.

But thlsmeans that ~ eontain~ infinitely ma~ str ips.
This fact con...tradicts the definition of a generalized contextu~ grammar.
It/L- 13  -follows that L is not a generalized contextual language,It is to be expected ~hat every generalized contextual lan-guage is a contex~-s~it ive language.
But the construction ofthe corresponding context-sensitive grammar seems to be verycomplicated, if we thin~ to the generation of the language~u.A.~reider has introduced a new type of grammars, calledgralamatlkl) and defined i~ neighborhood ~ira~.L~ars (okrestnostnye 'the following way (\[4o); see ~ 4 \ ] .
Our presentation is somewhat different).
Given a finite set V called vocabulary, twostrings x and y on V, and a context <u,v> on V, We saythat the pair ~u .v> ,y) is a neighborhood of y with respectto x if we can find two strings z and w, such that x=zu~vw.Every pair of the i or~ ~<u,v> , ~\] , where ~u,v> is a context on~, Whereas y is a string on V, is called a neighborhood onV.
Let us consider an element e which does not belong to V ;G will be called the bo~3dary element.
A neighborhood grammar isa triple of the form ~ V, e ,~ ,  where V is a vocabulary,is the boundary element and ~ is  a finite set of neighborhoodson the vocabulary VU(e}  .
Let L be a l~aguage on V. 2e saythat L is generated by the considered neighborhood grammar if~i every string x of the form x =~ye (with ymL) .and  onlyin such strings - there ~ is ts  in ~,  far every tera a i ofX=~la2...a s , a neighborhood of a i with respect to x.Neighborhood gray, mrs are closely related to the notion ofcontext, since this notion occurs in the definition of a neigh-borhood.
There is another notion, due to Ja.p.L.Vasilevski~ and- 14  -~.V.Ghom~ak6v (see ~he refermnce in~2\],p,~o), which e~la insthis fact.
Following these authors, a grammar of contexts (thisname is imp_roper, since no context occurs among its objects) isa triple <V,  e ,9> , where  .V and @ have the s-me meaning asin the definition of a neighborhood grammar, whereas Q is afinite set of strings on the vocabulary Vt3{e~ ?
This grammargenerates the language _L on V in the following way : x6if and only if for every s t r ing  y and a~y strings z and wfor which there exist strings u and v such that @ x@ == uzyuv we have eitherl) y = rasp , where sE Q, whereas the strings m and pmay be eventuallyor2) (~x@ = urynt, where qr = z , n t = w mad ryn is astring be long~g to Q.A string belonging to Q is said to be closed from t ~le~ (from the right) if its first (last) term is @ .
A stringbelonging to  Q is said to be ~ if it is closed bosh fromthe left and f~m the right.A grammar of contexts is said ~o be k-bounded if everynon-closed string of _~ is of length _k, whereas every Clesedstring of ~ is of length not greater than _kjAn important theorem of Bor?~ev asserts the equivalancebetween languages generated by neighborhood grammars and lan -guages generated by k-bounded grammars of con~s (~?3,p.4o).Since grammars of contexts and contextual grammars have somesimilarities in their definitions, it i s  Interesting to esta-blish more ~xac~ly the relation b~een them.v- 15  -Proposition 14.
There exists a contextual language ~hiohis regular, but which is not a neighborhood language.Proof.
Let us consider the language L = ~a~n~ (n=l,2,...).This language is regular, since it is generated by the regulargrammar consisting in the rules S ~ ~a, T-- ->Ua , U--->Ta,--->a, where ~ is the start symbol, La~ is the terminal vo-cabulary, whereas {S,T,U} is the non-terlainal vocabulary.
Letus consider the contextual gramnu~r G =~ {a} ,{CO}, {~a,a>~.I@ is easy to see that G generates the language ~ $ thereforeL is a contextual language.We shall show that L is not a neighborhood language.
Inthis respect, our method will be the following.
We shall considerall systems of possible neighborhoods of the terms of ~he string0aae and we shall show t~}at every such sysbem is either asystem of aeighborhoods of the ~erms of every string Cane (n== 2,3,4,...) or it is not a system of nei@\]borhoods of the terms0t the string ea@e .
It is easy to see that the first ~erm ofthe string @aa@ admits ~he following neighborhoods : 1 )e  ,2) Ca ,  3) @aa, ~) eaa~ .
The second term has the neigh-borhooas : l) G_a,~)-a~) aa , 4) ~e .
,  5) e_a_a , 6) e_~ae.The neighborhoods of the third term are : i) e@a , .
2) aa ,  -~)  a, ~)  _ae , 5) eaa8 , 6)_aaE) .
The lass term has theneighborhoods - 1) 8 , 2) _a~_ , 3) a a@_ , 4) @aa~ .
The no-ration _u_xv.
represents hier the ne ighborh~d {<u,v> ,x} .It is easy to see that the fourth neighborhood of the firs~and of the lass term c~t  b'e a neighborhood of e with respect@o @g48 .
On She other hand, a is a neighborhood of .aa withrespect to ea~@ for every n = 1,2, .
.
.
.
It follows that no- 16  -ne ighborhood  grammar of L = ~a2ZX 3 may contain one of She neigh.borhoods _0a2@ , Q a2~ and a.
Thus, if a neighborhood gram-mar of \]~ exists, it contains at leas~ one neighborhood fromevery group of the following four groups of neighborhoods :~) _0 , _~a, _ea 2 .~) e_a, _aa, _aae , G~a , ~.aaO.b') 6~-~, aa,  ..aO , ea_a~ , agO.We shall consider all possible combinations betweau a neigh-borhood of the group ~ and a neighborhood of the group E .
Bymn we shall denote the combination formed by the m.th neigh-borhood of ~ and the n-th neighborhood of ~ .
It is easy to seeChat every neighborhood grammar containing one of the combina-tions 12, 22, 23, 25, 42 generates a language whioh eontain~every string a n with n $ 2.
On the other hand~ every neigh-borhood grammar containing one of the combinations ll, 13, 14,15, 21, 24, 31, 32, 33, ~ ,  35, 41, 43, 44, 45, 51, 52, 53, 5~,55 generates a language which either does not contain the stringa 4 or contains every string a n with n~ 2 ?
(This depends onthe fact if the neighborhoods aa  or aa  belong or not to theconsidered neighborhood grammar).
Thus, there exists no neigh-borhood grammar which generates the language ~2n 3.But the definition of (generalized) contextual grammars,though adequate to the investigation of the generative power ofpurely contextual operations, does not correspond to ~he situa-tion existing in real (natural or artificial) l~guages,  whereevery string is admired only by some contexts and every o~u~/- 17 -admits only some strings.
Let us try to obtain a type of grammarcorresponding to this more complex situation.
We define a con___y -textual grammar with choice as a system G_ =<V,L ,~ ,~o>, whereV, L1 and~are  the objects of a contextual grammar, whereasis a mapp i~ defined on the universal language on V and hav i~the values in the set of subsets o f~.
We define the languagegenerated by G as the smallest language L having the follow-1 ?
~ L l x ~ L 2 ?
ing properties : If x , !
If ye L, <u,y>6 ~(y)and Z&~l ,  then u~L,  z v~L  and ~L .
Thus, every strin~chooses some contexts and every context chooses some strings.
Wedefine a contextual language with choice a language which is ge-nerated by a contextual grammar w i t~o ioe .
The investigationof these grammars and languages would better show the generativepower of contextual operations, in a manner which corresponds tothe situation existing in real languages.- -~$  -Referencesi.
