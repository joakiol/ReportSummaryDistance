A Real-time Integration of Concept-based Search andSummarization on Chinese WebsitesJoe F Zhou and Weiquan Liulntel China Research Center100020 Beijing, China~/oe.f.zhou; louis.liu}@intel.comAbstractThis paper introduces an intuitive searchenvironment for casual and novice Chineseusers over Internet.
The system consists of fourcomponents, a concept network, a queryreformulation model, a standard search engine,and an automatic summarizer.
When the userenters one or more fairly general and vagueterms, the search engine returns an initialanswer set, and at the same time pipes the queryto the concept network that connects thousandsof conceptual nodes, each referring to a specificconcept for a given domain and pointing to anumber of associated conceptual terms.
If theconcept is located in the network, the relatedconceptual terms are displayed.
The user has theoption of using one or more of these specificterms to reformulate he next round of searches.Such search iterations continue until the user' sultimate information seeking goal is reached.For each search iteration, auto summarizerpresents the main theme of the documentretrieved and an optional text-to-speech enginecan read out the output summary if the userprefers.1.
IntroductionInternet is changing the world, and at the sametime changing people' s information seekingbehaviour.
Traditionally, information searchersare trained professionals working in libraries orother special technical or scientific fields.
Theyhave developed a variety of  techniques andheuristics for addressing information seekingdifficulties in the environment typicallydominated by Boolean query formula.
TheseBoolean information retrieval systems arenormally commercial and non-interactivesystems and the searches conducted in suchsettings are exact-match and set-based retrievalfrom databases of indexed citations andabstracts of documents (Koenemann and Belkin,1996).
With the dramatic explosion ofinformation sources over Internet, current userpopulation isno longer estricted to' professionalsearchers.
Practically it includes everyone inlife.
The majority of these users, however, areeither casual or novice or both.
Casual users,such as browsers of news stories, look forinteresting information rather than informationrelevant o a specific need (Stadnyk and Kass,1992).
Novice users may have a specificinformation topic, but due to little or no trainingin search and retrieval, they don' t know howto make best use of the available operators andtools.
On the whole, query formulation is oneproblem facing both types of information users(Turtle, 1994).
Internet users all have difficultyin mapping their intent to any logical querystructure.
They prefer limiting their searches toone or a simple list of terms, while seeking helpfrom the system to guide them to achieve theirultimate information goal.In this paper we introduce an integrated systemthat combines a standard search system with aquery reformulation model, a pre-constructedconcept network, an automatic documentsummarizer, and an optional text-to-speech(TTS) engine.
Together, these intelligentcomponents provide intuitive humanintelligence to the Chinese users over Internet.The integrated system not only guides andnavigates the user to perform searches in ahumanly conversational way, but also makesand delivers the retrieved information back tothe user in a simple, succinct, and easilycomprehensible manner.2.
System ConfigurationFigure 1 and Figure 2 present the overall systemconfiguration and data flow of the integratedsystem.
The system consists of four maincomponents: a concept net, a query148reformulation model, a standard search engine,and a summarizer.
There is also an optionalcomponent, i.e., if the user chooses, she canlaunch a text-to-speech (TTS) engine to read outthe automatically generated summary.The concept net is a network of conceptualterms.
It is normally constructed for a specificdomain with certain amount of humanintervention.
A link connects each pair ofrelated concepts in the network, specifying thesemantic relationship between them.
For thecurrent economic news domain, the main typesof relationships include, but not limited to,canonical form of, synonym of, hyponym of,hypernym of, part of, product of, member of,etc.The system accepts users' queries expressed inChinese natural language.
The query maycontain the terms that are already stored in theconcept network.
Unlike professional searchers,Most of Chinese web users have little training ininformation retrieval or have no priorknowledge or experience in it.
They may noteven know where to search and how to search.To perform an initial search, they tend to useone or more very general or vague terms.
Undersuch circumstances the system guidance andnavigation are extremely important.
One uniquefunctionality of this integrated system is tointuitively lead a casual or novice user from amore general search to a more specific searchuntil the user becomes satisfied with thereturned information.For each search conducted, the queryreformulation model looks up the conceptnetwork for more specific terms that are relevantto the more general terms in the earlier query.For example, if a general term is a company' sname, then its subsidiaries, its products, its stocksymbol, its industrial code, etc.
are consideredto be specific information about the company.The query reformulation model either replacesor expands the original query with these relatedterms and formulates them into a standardizedformat.
Search operators, such as AND, OR,NOT, NEAR, etc.
are used to connect the termsselected.
Assigned to each individual term is adifferent weight so as to reshape a new searchemphasis.The standard search engine performs the searchagainst the targeted database using thereformulated query with N relevant documentsreturned in an order of  the relevance to thequery (N is a number defined by the user and itis 10 by default).
At the same time, the conceptterms in the original query and thecorresponding specific terms extracted from theconcept network are also displayed.
The webinterface is designed in a way that makes eachof the specific terms searchable.
The user hasthe choice to select any of these specific termsto form a new query.
The search engine takesthe new query to perform the next round ofsearch, actually a more specific search based onthe user' s intention.
The iteration continues -the more specific search while using morespecific terms, the closer the user will be to hisdesired information - though he can stopanytime after each search iteration to examinethe retrieved ocuments.A text summarizer automatically generates thesummaries for the documents each searchiteration returns (Liu and Zhou, 2000).
Togetherwith the output summary, a selection panel thatincludes the key-word list (average 3 to 6words), the headline, and the leading text(usually the first 100 characters) of thedocument is displayed.
The selection panelprovides the user with an ability of examiningthe retrieved information more efficiently.
Byglancing over the key words, the user should beable to grasp the main idea of the document.
Hecan make a decision whether to skip thedocument or continue to learn more about it.
Ifhis choice is the latter, he can move up to theheadline or the leading text that offer moreabout he document content.
He can, of course,move further to look at the summary that issupposedly a mini-document of the original.
I fthe user decides to move further to read theentire document, then he will click on thehyperlinked title or headline of the document.The integrated system will go directly online,usually a specific website, to grab the documentfor the user.Associated with the summarizer is an optionaltext-to-speech (TTS) engine.
The user canchoose either to read the document himself orget relaxed by simply listening to the system' svoice output.149Query__~ QueryreformulationI Standardt~ search engine SummarizerFig.

2 System Data Flow3.
An ExampleSummarizationSearch andIn this section we use an example to illustratehow the integrated system works.Suppose that here is a Chinese user who has noexperience in search over Internet, neither hasany idea regarding where or how to do it.
Hejust heard some news about F~ (Legend, oneof the biggest computer manufacturingcompanies in China) and wants to find it outfrom Internet.
When we make our integratedsearch and summarization system available tohim, the only word in his mind is the name ofthe company ~,~ (Legend).
So, he enters thisfairly general term as his fast search query andpresses the Go button (see Figure 3 (a)).Figure 3 (b) shows what the integrated systemreturns to the user in response to his initial150search.
In addition to the top 10 most relevantdocuments, two more specific terms areextracted from the pre-constructed conceptnetwork, i.e., t I~ \ [ \ ]  (Legend Corporation)and I~,flgJ\]~ (Legend computer).
In theconcept network these two terms are found to beclosely associated with the initial searchtermF~,~., (Legend).
When the user examinesthe top relevant document returned, he fmds thata selection panel is displayed on the interfacethat is associated with this (or each) returneddocument.
If looking up from the last row, henotices three key words that are extracted fromthe document, i.e., ~ \ [ \ ]  (LegendCorporation), ?d,-T:~_~ B\](electronic company),~1~ ~)~- (internationally well-knownbrand).
By putting these three key wordstogether the user should be able to grasp themain idea expressed in the document(something like "Legend Corporation is anelectronic company who has someinternationally well-known brand names" ).
I fthe user wants to know more about thedocument, he can move up to click the buttonf l~3~J  (automatic summarization) or readthe leading text (in this case the first 50characters from the document are extracted).
Ifthe user wants to refer to the entire document,he can do it by clicking on the headline.
Theintegrated system will go live to Internet oretrieve the entire original text.But, what if the user is not satisfied with thecurrent answer set?
Then, he has an option ofkicking off another ound of  search.
To do thathe may want to narrow down his search bychoosing between ~o~,~-,~ \[\] (LegendCorporation) and I~f~ f l~  (Legendcomputer) - the two relatively speaking, morespecific terms associated with his initial queryI~  (Legend).
Let us suppose that the userdecides to select 1~?3.~ \[\]  (LegendCorporation) to conduct a new but morespecific search.
The search can be activated bysimply clicking on this selected term.
Figure 3(e) shows the results of this search iteration.Again, in addition to the top 10 most relevantdocuments returned, more than 20 related termsare extracted in this round from the conceptnetwork that are considered to be conceptuallyrelevant o the search termID~,~..,~\[\] (LegendCorporation).
These terms represent even morespecific concepts comparing to the two specificterms returned in the first round.
A detailedexamination of these terms reveals that theyrepresent the following conceptual categories:first, more specific news or information aboutthe company, such as ~\ [ \ ] IT~3 l r  (the head ofChinese 1T), ?P~-T~'~f3~~" (No.
1 of thefirst 100 most powerfil electronic companies inChina), \ ]~L~ (Joint venture of Legendand CA) and ~ t ~  (Happy Family, asoftware kit); the products of LegendCorporation, such as F~*~;{~ (Legendmotherboard), ~,~..~'f~ (Legend software),~ ~  (Legend Chinese card); themanagement of Legend company, such asF~,~,~J~ (president of Legend), I~,~,~lJ,~,~(vice-president of Legend); and other relatedcorporations, such as ~i~:.~ll~\[~ (businesscorporation), ~f13~ (electroniccorporation), I.~L~ \[\] (industrialcorporation), and ~ /~ \[\] (HaierCorporation).
At this point, the user has anotheroption.
He can go through the selection panelassociated with each retrieved ocument to seewhich document contains the information hewants.
If so, his search iteration will terminate.If  not, he can reformulate his next search byselecting any one or more terms from thespecific term list.
In this particular case, the usermay go for the first choice since the topdocument retrieved turns out to be identical forthese two search iterations conducted so far.
Thedocument entitled J.~ZJ~ll/kJl~!~3-~qF0~~1~I~~ (Reorganization of LegendCorporation to welcome the joining of WTO)receives the relevance rate of 100% in bothsearches.
This is probably the news aboutLegend Corporation the user is looking for.As mentioned above, even if the user hasobtained the information he desires, he still canreformulate or expand his next search for morespecific news about ~ (Legend Corporation).Also, the user can launch a completely newsearch for another company.
Remember~J~/F~\[\] (Haier Corporation), another mostpowerful company in China, appears in thespecific term list.
By clicking on this term, theuser will be able to locate the latest news orother information about a new company.151Chinese  Web News Summadzer  ant i  R, .Enter  a genera l  te rm,  say ,"Legend", the name of a; ........... 0"  ...................... 7 - . "

ConclusionThis paper presents an intuitive search systemfor casual or novice Chinese users on specificwebsites.
Instead of describing the algorithmicportions of each component, we focus onillustrating the overall system design and howthe integrated system works and serves the end-users.
The presented system provides humanintelligence to the user who desires to seekrelevant information over Interact.
It does notassume that the user receives any training insearch and retrieval or has any prior experiencein using Internet.
The user can start his searchwith a general and vague term or idea.
Theintegrated system will guide the user from ageneral search to a series of more specificsearches until he is fully satisfied with theinformation returned.
Our survey states that theexisting search systems, especially those in theChinese market, are still dominated by key termsearch mechanism.
This integrated systempresents a new paradigm.
It provides a concept-driven search environment that allows the userto manipulate the semantic relationshipsbetween the original query terms with itsassociated terms.
We have so far built twoapplications based on two specific domains.
Thepreliminary results have demonstrated that theintegration of a concept network, a queryreformulator, a standard search algorithm, anauto summarizer, and an optional TTS engineindeed suits the current information seekingbehavior and make search activities in websitesmore intuitive, as well as productive.ReferencesBrandow et al Brandow R.
