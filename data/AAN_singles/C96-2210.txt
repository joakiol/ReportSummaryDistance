Whenone works with a general anguage andnot a sublanguage, there are differentcases of ambiguities at difterent classi-cal levels; and more particularly whenone works on COml)lex language t)henom-ena analysis (coordination, ellipsis, nega-tion...) it is ditfic.ult o take into accountall the different ypes of these construc-tions with a general grammar.
Indeed,the inconvenience of this approach is thepossible risk of a combinatory explosion.So, we have defined the TALISMAN ar-chitecture that includes linguistic agentsthat corrost)ond either to classical ev-els in linguistics (morI)hology, syntax, se-mantic) or to coml)lex language phcnoln-ena analysis.1 Int roduct ionTile goal of this paper is to show that complexlinguistic phenomena like coordination, ellipsis ornegation, call be defined and processed in andistributed architecture.
In tile processing of avery large corpus, the problem is to find an ap-t)roach allowing tile best interaction between dif-ferent knowledge levels (morphological, syntactic,semantic...) in order to reduce the generation oftile ambiguities, that occur within any general sys-tem of sequential analysis.Most NLP systems use a sequential architec-ture embodying classical linguistic layers.
Amongthem one can find systems for English analysissuch as ASK \[Thomson 85\], LOQUI \[Binol, & al85\], TEAM \[Pereira 85\] and for Prench analysissuch as SAPHIR \[Erli 87\] or LEADER \[Benoit& el.
86\].
Due to l;he necessity for cooperationbetween differents modules, we have turned our-selves to the technics of multi-agents systems fortile construction of TALISMAN architecture \[Ste-fanini 93\].
This system also uses linguistic modelsof the CRISTAL system \[MMI2 89\].
Tile TAMS-MAN architecture includes linguistic agents thatcorrespond either to classical evels in linguistics(morphology, syntax, semantic) or to complex lan-guage phenomena analysis (coordination, ellipsis,negation...).2 Ambigu i t ies  in text  analysis2.1 Examples of ambiguities at differentlevels in the CR ISTAL  system:In NLP, when on(', works with a general languageand not a sublanguage, there are different cases ofambiguities at different classical levels.Preprocessing: the characters are standardizedand tile text is cut; into forlns.
So, tile lmnctua-lions can be ambiguous.
For example, a fllll stop(:all indicate an abbreviation or the end of the sen-tence.
M. Clavier (prot)cr noun/common noun)Morphology: the text forlns are processed in-dividually by the morphological nalyser \[Aho &Corasick 1975\] that attributes one or more inter-pretations to each in terms of a pair (lexical entry,category).One of the difficulties is to find tile verb intile homonymous sequence with D/Y (determi-nant/preverbal) F/V (noun/verb).
It is possibleto predict either the beginning of a noun phrase(SN) or a verbal phrase (SV).Exalnple: Pilots (l) like (2) flying (3) planes (1)can (1) be dangerous.
(1) Pilots, planes, can are either be verbs (topilot/to plane) or nouns (a pilot/a t)lane/a (:all ofbee,-) (v/F).
(2) like is either a verb (to like) or a preposition(like) (V/P).
The cooperation between agents inthe Talisman system is detailled in \[Koning & al9q.Syntax: A general grammar has rules whichinterfere with other rules.
For example: N"->N"N" enat)les to tmilt N" resulting fi'om the con-catenation of two N (noun or adjective)".
Thisrule allows to construct he juxtaposition of nounphrases.
Example: Le lyee Louis (F(nom,ppr) LeGrand.
But this rule also is applied in tile follow-ing example: On associe h \[chaque gtudiant\]SN1151fun num&o de carte\]SN.Semantics: there are notions of ambiguity andparaphrase.
The inodals can be paraphrasedin a variety of ways.
Example: he may come/ it's possible that he comes/will come/I per-mit/authorize/empower him to come.2.2 Disambiguisation methodsAn ambiguity appears when several solutions arepossible for the same problem.
These ambiguitiesare produced by a module or are the consequenceof different analysis modules.2.2.1 Local grammars fordisambiguisation:We advocate the use of local grammars for somedisambiguisation f several solutions produced bya module.
For example, we can use contextuallaws for some morphological disambiguisation.
In-deed, the following laws are always valid for writ-ten fi'ench analysis:- Law 1: Determiner+ (Noun or Verb) > De-terminer(D) + Noun(F)English example : "the address ..."- Law 2: Pronoun + (Noun or Verb) > Pro-noun(Y) + Verb(V)English example: "I address ..."These laws can be viewed as partial sohttionsfor combinatory explosion.2.2.2 Interactions for disambiguisation:In some cases, the interactions between differentmodules allow a faster disaInbiguisation.
Indeed,an agent can use tile knowledge of another agentwhen needed.For example, during the morphological nd syn-tactical analysis of the sentence "I(Y) want(V)the(D) c-mail(F) address(F or" V)", interactionsbetween MORPH and SYNT are useful.
MORPHwill send all the sure morphological informationsto SYNT; MORPH will propose tile two morpho-logical interpretations for "address".
SYNT willimmediatly reject the "address" = Verb solutionin this sentence, thanks to its knowledges.In other cases, cooperation between agents isneeded when two agents produce different solu-tions for the same problem.
For example, the formand can be viewed as a syntagm coordinator or asa proposition coordinator.3 D is t r ibuted  approach  forNatura l  Language Process ingBlackboards have been applied in linguistics toSpeech Understanding Systems \[Erman 80\] andmore recently to the analysis of written French(HELENE \[Zweigenbaum 89\], CARAMEL \[Sabah90\]) and documentary research \[Mekaouche 91\].The global control of these systems is fully cen-tralized: the distribution of the reasoning capa-bilities enforces the maintenance of a global rep-resentation that is c.oherent and thus requires theuse of belief revision mechanisms.
Architecturesbased on direct communication between agents al-low complete distribution of both knowledge con-trol and distribution of partial results.We will briefly report, on the agent and on agent;society concepts as they are defined in \[Stefanini93\].
A linguistic agent; can be divided into twomain parts: its knowledge representation a d itsknowledge processing.
Knowledge and goals canbe given or acquired through coInmunication withother agents.At present, the society in the TALISMAN ap-plication is represented by the following linguis-tic agents: PRET for preprocessing, MORPH formorphological analysis, SEGM for splitting intoclauses \[Maegaard & Spang Hanssen 78\], SYNTfor syntactic analysis, TRANSF for transforma-tions of utterances (interrogatives, imperatives,etc...) in declarative clauses, COORD for coor-dinations, NEGA for negations and ELLIP for el-lipses.
These agents arc describe.d in details iil\[Stefanini 93\].
There are different ypes of decom-position: Knowledge decomposition by abstrac-tion (PRET, MORPH, SEGM, SYNT...), task de-composition by type of input (COORD, NEGA),task decomposition by type of output (ELLIP).Tile TALISMAN system is based on direct con>munication between agents and thus uses mail-boxes for sending messages with an asynchronousmode of communication.
Speech acts \[Searle 69\]are usually used to comnmnieate in a Multi-AgentSystem.
Intentions of the sender are expressed ina common eomnmnication language.
The possibh;interactions between agents during a conversationhave to be regulated, this is clone by means ofinteraction protocols.In the TALISMAN system, tile communicationlanguage and the interaction protocols are basedon the work of Sian \[Sian 90\].3.1 MessagesIn the systetn, an agent willing to send a messagewill use the following message format:((sender, receiver(s)), (performative, for(:(;),content).Tile name of tile sending agent enhances themessage understanding and the answer.
Thesender should determine the addressee agent(s)with the help of its knowledge about the otheragents; if he has none, he will send the message toevery agent in tile system.The performative of the message is either asimple sending information, a request or a reply.However, these types of messages do not suffice toexpress all tile intentions agents may have.
We1152have "used" the.
comnnmieation language (level-oped by Sad Sian because it is adapted to theeomlnulfication neetts of the system.
This com-munication language figures out 9 forces : propose,modify, assert, agree, disagree, noopinion, confirm,accept and withdraw.We will not use the force.
"accept" that requiresthe agreement of every agents.
We also did notuse the forces "agreed" and "disagreed" becauseour agents only have reliable information.The l)ropositional content is tbrmulated in theknowledge ret)reselfl;ation language of the agellt.3.2 Cmninun icat ion  I)rotocolsAn interaction i)rotoeol is a set of rules contain-ing t;he 1)ossible intt:ractions during a conversa-tion; it provides trategies for t)rol)leln solving dueto the co-existence of several agents in tile samesystem.
For the (:ooperatioi~ t)etween agents, wehave adapted the protocol of Sian to the neetls ofa natural anguage processing syst(;m for writtenfrent:h.Our i)rotocols will use tit(: language communi-cation detined al)ove.

It will tind: "I (Y) should (V) cor-re.ct (V) the (i)) paper (Fnoun) and (C(intra /inter)) address (Fnoun,V)him (Y)?"
The cooper-ation between the morphological nd synt;mticalleve.ls can start; Morph send first, all the sure in-t'orinal;ions:SEND (Morph, Synt; In-form, Assert; \["I:--Y","shouhl= V", "(:orrect---V","the--D", "paper = F", "and = C", "him =Y"I)Then, the coordinator "and" can be viewed bythe segmentation (Segm) as a proposition coor-dinator (inter-prol)osition coordination) and bythe coordination (Coord) as a nominal syntagln(noted SN) coordinator (intra-proI)osition coordi-nation), l/ut, after the disamt)iguisaton f "ad-dress" the Coord agent will change his I)oint ofview.
The sending of messages can be done likebillowing:1- R1 SEND (Morph, (Coord, Seam); Re.quest,/; \["and"=C(intra/inter)\])2- Ill SEND (Mol't)h , Synl;; Request, Propose;\[" address" :F ,V \ ] )3- R2 SEND (Seam, Morph; Ih'.quest, /;\[nb_verb_(:onj ug --- ?\] )4- 11.2 SEND (Morph, Seam; Answer, Assert;\[nb_verb_con.i ug -- 2\])5- 1/.1 SEND (Seam, Morph; Answer, Assert;\["and"=C(inter)\])6- I1 SEND (Segln, (Synt, Coord, Ellip); In-form, Assert; \["aild":C(inter)\])7- I2 SEND (Synt, (Coord, Segm); hfform, As-sert; \["the paper"=SN\])8- H1 SEND (Synt, Morph; Answer, Assert;\["address" =V,F\])9- I3 SEND (Synt, (Se.gln, Coord); hfform, As-sert; \[" address" =V,F\])10- I4 SEND (Ellip, (Synt, Seam); Inforin, As-sert; \[eJlips_subjeet ="I"\])11- I5 SEND (Ellip, (Synt, Segm); Inform, As-se.rt; \[ellips_c.o.d="The paper"\])12- R1 SEND (Coord, Morph; Answer, Assert;\[" and"< > C(intra)\])13- 16 SEND (Coord, (Seam, Ellip, Synt); In-form, Assert; \["and"<>C(intra)\])1153Legend: Hi : is the hypothesis  on which theagents have to work.Ri : is the information request i at which theagents have to answer.Ii : is the information sending i.In fact, this is an example of a possible devel-opment of the interaction protocols by the agentsconcerned by the coordination phenomena.
Butthe use of pseudo-parallelism and asynchronoussending of messages can provide different sendingof messages.5 Conc lus ionIn this paper, we have proposed a method tosolve some ambiguities and some complex lin-guistic phenomena in a TALISMAN Multi-AgentSystem.
To allow cooperation and resolution ofconflicts, we have developed interaction protocolsadapted to the needs of a natural anguage pro-cessing system for written french.
These interac-tion protocols allow cooperation and resolution ofconflicts that appear at one time in the system,particularly during complex linguistic phenomenatreatment.Currently, we are integrating the prototype lin-guistic agents (which implement different types ofcoordination, egation and ellipsis) in order to val-idate the developed protocols.
The implementa-tion is realized with Prolog II+ on an IBM Work-station.
After the implementation, wewill be ableto evaluate and possibly refine the cooperationand conflicts resolution methods that have beendeveloped.ReferencesBenoit P., Rincel P., Sabatier P., Vienne D. Auser-friendly natural anguage interface to or-acle.
