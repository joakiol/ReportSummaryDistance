The t reatment  of Scope and  Negat ionin Ro~etta *Etly van MunsterPhilips Research LaboratoriesP.O.
Box 80.000, 5600 JA Eindhoven, The NetherlandsA bst, rac tThis paper deals with the treatment of Scope and, inparticular, Negation in Rosetta, aMachine Translation:~ystem which translates between Dutch, English andSpmfish (Spanish only as a target language).
It will be~u-gued ~hat the SOV- versus SVO-character of a lan~guage has important consequences for its possibilitiesof reflecting scope through word order.
A descriptionwill be given of the problems that arise translating fromone type of language (the SOV-language Dutch) to theother (the SVOo.lar~guages English and Spanish).
Theextent o wtfich these problems can be solved will beout;lined.The paper has been divided into two main sections.In section one the phenomena are described linguistiocally, in section two a general idea is given of how thesephenomena are dealt with in Rosetta.~.
L ingu is t i c  phenomena1o:~ :Expression of Scope3cope beaxing elements ea~l be divided into two classes:1) NEG, containing both the adverbs niet(Dutch)/not(English)~ noCSpanish)and quazltifiers with mor-phologically incorporated negation, such as nicts(D.)/~o,hi,g(n.)/nada(S.).2) NPs and adverbials containing a quantifier (fromnow on Q-elements)', like reel kinderen(D.)/ many chil-drea(E.)/ touches nir~os($.
), een vis(D.)/ a fish(E.)/.n pe~(s.), ,a~k(D.) /  o/ten(nO~ m,,chas ~ee~,(S.), in~o,,,~i~e ge,omnCD.
)/ in ,omc ca,es(S.)/ ~n olg~o,casos(S.), etc.The question I am concerned with is how the scope or-der of Q-elements and NEG can be determined.
Ina Montague GraJnmar of the PTQ type, (1) wouldhave two interpretations, one with Every man havingwide scope mid one with two women having wide scope/Montague 19~3/, Dowry 1981/:(1) Every man loves two women.~This paper condenses part of the content of the author's~,heai~, /Van Munster 1985/I extended with the results offurther esearch.
This research was partially sponsered byNehem (Nederiandse Herstructureringsmaatschapplj).XIn thin paper 1 limit myself to Q-NPs~ although a par-allel can be drawn between Q-NPs and Q-Adverbials (in- "eluding Q~PPs).
Furthermore only extensional contexts aretaken into consideration; i tensional contexts are ignored.However, the interpretation with Every man llavirLgwide scope is far more natural.
Therefore, in actor-.dance with Jackendoff's principle~ /Jackendoff 1972/~I make the simplifying assumption that sur/ac~ orderin principle represents the most plausible sFope orderof Q-.elementa azld NEG in the following sense:"A Q/NEG element has scope over ~he Q/NEG el~me~d,on its right and is itself iuside the scope of the Q/NEGelements on its lefl".Stat ing ii'om this principle implies that other impor~taut factors are not taken into consideration, such as:o Intonation, which is not visible in a written teXtoTherefore sentences are considered raider neutralstress and intonation.Context.
Currently Qnly isolated sentences ~cetaken into consideration.Essential for translation is that, even if we assume that(1) is ambiguous between two scope readings, the se~l-tence in the target language will have this same ambleguity as long as the Q-elements have the same surfaceorder as in the source language.
~n'thermore, bothsentences will have the same 'most plausible reading'?\]\[.2 SVO versus SOVRosetta translates between two types of languages,namely the SOV-type (Dutch) and the SVOotype(Spanish and English).
This SOV- versm~ SVOocharacter has important consequences for the expres?sion of scope.
I claim that in both types of languagesthe position of NEG is as close to the left-hand sideof the verb as possible: it only precedes possible Q~elements that are wlthin the scope of NEG/Van Munoster 1985/.Consider the following scheme:Dutch: S O-(O) NEG-VEnglish/Spanish: S NEG-V 0 - (0 )In an SOV-language the verb (in basic position) is insentence-final position, while in an SVOdangaage theverb is in second position.
Consequently, in a~a SVO..language only two elements (one in subject po~itionand one in 'zhift-position~, i.e.
the position to the left ofthe subject) s can precede NEG; the objects are to theright of NEG in basic position?
~L an SOV-languagelike Dutch, however, the objects axe to the left of NEGin basic position.
In principle there is no restriction tothe number of elements that can appear to the left ofNEG.In genera\[ it can be said that, especially if the sentence442contains a NEG, an SOV-language is more 'suited' toexpress scope through word order than is an  SVO-language.This basic difference between Dutch and Span-ish/English can cause problems when translating fromone type of language into the other.
Consider e.g.
(2),where (2)a cannot be translated into (2)b since therelative order of NEG and the Q-NP is not the same:(2) a De kinderen aten reel snoepjes niet op.
'The-children-at e-many-sweeten.not 'b The children didn*t eat many sweets.~u the :English sentence the object has to be topicaUzedin urde~ *o get the correct scope relations:(2) c lvfany sweets the children didn't eat.
)L2i Subd iv i s ion  o f  Quant i f ie rsl: argue that the following subdivision of NPa can bemade:IA) Qo)~Ps oenuttive to scope, i.e.
the surface orderof Q-NPs mid NEG is crucial for the interpretation.
(Dutch: iemand ('everybody'), ten N ('a N'), reel N('many N'), alle N ('all N'), twee N ('two N'); English:many Ill; meet; Spanish: muehos ( 'many'), dos N ('two~'), etc.).E.g.
(3)a does not mean the same as (3)b:(3) a Niet reel mensen houden van vis.~Not-many-people-like-fish'b Veel menses houden niet van vis.~Many-people--llke~not -fish'IS) Q.:,NPs not  senstt lve to scope,  i.e.
the sur-face order of Q-NPs and NEG is not crucial tot theinterpre~,ation; these NPs always have wide scope, ir-respective of their position.
(e.g.
sommige N ('saline'),most N, alguien ('someone'), something, etc.)
Sincethese NPs do contain a quantifier, however, there is astrong preference for a surface order which reflects thescope.
Therefore, (4)b is a much more natural wordorder than (4)a, although both sentences have in factthe same meaning.
(NB.
For some speakers (4)a is evenout).
(4) a )Niemand gelooft sommige opmerkingen.~Nobody-believes-some-remaxks 'b 3ommige opmerkingen gelooft niemand.~Some-remarks-believes-nobody'2) deflxdte iqPs  (e.g.
Jan (' John'), her boek ('thebook*), the maay linguias, etc.).
Surface order is ir-relevant for scope-interpretation.
If in (4)a and (4)b2Another term would be *topicaliv.ation-posltion'.
How-ever, thin term can cause confusion since in Rosetta dis-~inct ion is made between 'scope-shift' ( reated in this paper;the sentence still ha~ a neutral intonation), and ' topical iza-t ion ~ (th0~ sentence has a non-neutral intonation; not thesurface order but the original position of the topiealizedQ-elemettt reflects the scope.}
Both types of shift go toaM#-po~'tfo~ Scopeoshift isa transformation, Topicalizationrule.
(For these terms ave section 2.1).,ommige is rephced by the de .
re  d~,  (~) ~nd (b)not only have the same meaning but there is no dif-ference in naturalness either.
Definite NPs have thefeat.~e \[-q\].1A and 1B together are the NPs traditionally calledquantifiers.
I will indicate tile two types with resp.the features \[+S\] and \[-S\].Note that the subdivision of Q-NPs is language spe?tide, e.g.
iemand in Dutch is scope-sensitive, whilethe Spanish and English equivalents (resp.
alguien axialsomeone) are not.Spanish and English seem to have much more \[-S\] ele~ments than Dutch does, which, as I claim, relates to thefact that they are less suited to express cope throughword order (see section 1.2).1.4 Two approaches  to  scopeIn TG-oriented theories a distinction is often made be-.tween different ypes of negation: S~negation and V}?~negation (e.g./Jackendoff 1972/, /Las~ik 19'n/, a.o.
Lwith the speciM addition of TVP- and Vonegation forDutch (e.g./Hoekstra 1985/) s. To illustrate brieflywhat is meant by the different ypes of' negation~ letme give an example of each:(5) a Jan heeft geen boek gelezen.'
John--has-no-book-read'(S-negation)b Niet reel menses, hebben een boek geleze~?
'Not-many-people-have-a-b ook-read'(S-negation)c Iemand heeft niet gereisd.
'Somebody-has-not-travelled'(VP~negation)d Veel menses hebben geen boek gelezen.
'Many-people--have-no-bo k-r cad'(TVP-negation)e Jan heeft veel mensen lets niet verteld.
~' John-has-many-people-something-not-t old'(V-negation)It is assumed that the constituents o the right of 1NEG,including the verb, are within the scope of NEG.
In (a)NEG follows the subject, but since Jan is definite, S-negation is equivalent to VP-negation: as a general rulethe position of NEG is after a definite (unless the sen-tence is eontrastive).
Both (a) and (b), however, cartbe paraphrased by 'it is not the case that ...' which isa proof of S-negatlon /Jackendoff 1972/.
In (c) NEGhas scope over the VP containing an intransitive verb,in (d) over the VP containing a transitive verb plus di-rect object and in (e) merely over the transitive verb.In logical terms, however, these sentences merely diI-fer in the relative scope order of NEG and Qoelement~t(i.e.
of scope operators).

the argument structure of the verb),in order to express the correct scope relations in thesentence.
Consider e.g.
(9):(9) Veel boeken leest iedereen.
'Mmly-bo ks-reads-everyb ody'Recall that in analysis the Q-arguments are substitutedfrom left to right (cf.
section 2.2), i.e.
reel boeken (=x2) before iedereen (= xl).
Now, the output of thegenerative rules is as follows:Rst~trt: x l  x2 lezenRsubst,xl: (blocked)Rsubst,:rl has to apply first but is blocked since thereis a free VAR (x2) to the right.This type of switch also occurs in translating from onelanguagv into the other, namely if the verb in the TLhas a different order of arguments than the verb in theSL.
Consider e.g.
the following verbpatterns:Sp~aish: x l  dar x2 x3Dutch: x l  x3 x2 gevenAgain a~suming that surface-order reflects cope order,(10)a aud (10)b are not a correct translation of eachother:(10) a Jan geeft iedereen een boek.'
John-gives-everybody-a( ='some')-book'b Juan da un libro a todo el mundo.'
John-glves-a('cer t aln')-book-to-everybody'The order of Q-NPs in the Spanish sentence has to beawitr~_mmchaw~SNEG is introduced syncategorematically, lthough itcould have been a basic expression as well.2.2.2 SOV/SVO prob lemsIf a sentence containing a NEG-element has to betranslated from an SOV-language (like Dutch) intoan SVO-language (like English/Spanish) problems mayarise.
Recall that the position of NEG is closely relatedto the position of the verb (cf.
scheme in section 2).In principle no problems arise if NEG does not followa Q-object in Dutch.
( l l )a  and (12)a can simply betranslated into ( l l )b  and (f2)b respectively:(11) a Niet iedereen komt.b Not everybody comes.
(12) a Veel mensen krijgen geen kado.b Many people don't get a present.However, as I explained in section 1.2, in Dutch (anSOV-language), NEG may occur to the right of a non-topicalized Q-object, as in (13):(13) Wij stelden veel vragen niet.
'We-asked-many-questions-not'The corresponding syntactic derivation tree is as fol-lows (since the Dutch and English trees are isomorphic,I only give the English or target one):/Rsubst,  xl/ \Rsubst, x2 We/ \Rneg many quest ?ons/Rstart/ I \ask xl x2Schematically, the output of the rules is:Dutch:Rstart: xl  x2 stellen1L~eg: xl  x2 niet stellenRsubst,x2: xl veel vragen niet stellenRsubst,xl: Wij veel vragen niet stellenEnglish:Rstart :  xl ask x2P..neg: (blocked)Since x2 is to the right of the verb (and thus of theNEG-position), Rneg is blocked.
Note that this block-ing is justified: without blocking the result of applyingthe English rules would be (14), which is not a correcttranslation of (13):(14) We didn't ask many questions.In other words, the wrong output is blocked but howcan a correct translation be obtained?4452.2 .3  Genera l  s t ra tegy  fo r  a so lu t ionIn \]I{osetta two types of VAR~ are distinguished,namely \[+Q\] and f-Q\].
Later on a Substitution rulecan only substitute a \[+Q\] NP for a \[+QI VAR and af--Q\] NP for a \[-QI VAR'9 The following general strat-egy is followed:Ira the Mffft-transformations, where VARs are shifted,\[+Q\] VARs are shifted to shift-position under certaincondltions, x?
Since there is only one shift-position,only one VAR can be shifted at a time.
These trans-formations precede the substitution-rules.The shift-transformations can be subdivided into twoCa, ses:1.
A VAR is shifted over a \[+Q\] VAR.For (9), (in which both arguments are \[q-q\]), thismeans that the shift-transformations render twosurface orders of VARa:(path i) xl  x2 lezen(path ii) shift/x2 x l  lezenLater on, in the Substitution rules, only (ii) of-fers the correct input for a succesful applicationof Substitution rules, since VAR1 has to be sub-stituted first (right-left generation).
This type ofshift is only meant to get the correct scope rela-tions in a sentence, both when translating Dutch-Dutch and Dutch-Engl ish/Spanish (see also note2).2.
A VAR.
is shifted over a f-Q\] VAR, under one ofthe following conditions:a.
There are two \[+Q\] VARs in the VP.
The leftone can shift over the f-Q\] NP (subject).b.
There is one \[+Q\] VAR in the VP; a negation-rule has to follow.Although the conditions for both Dutch and Span-ish/English are the same, the motivation for the shiftover a f-Q\] NP in both types of languages (i.e.
SOVvs.
SVO) is different:For SVO-languages this shift is necessary in order toput a \[+Q\] argument in a position to the left of NEG,i.e.
to get the correct scope relations.Consider again the output of the English rules for (13)(V = 'to ask'):Rule OutputRstart: x l  V x2Tshift: (i) x l  V x2(ii) shift/x2 x l  VRneg: (i) (blocked)(ii) shift/x2 x l  not VRsu,x2: (ii) many (IS x l  not VRsu,xl:  (ii) many qs we not -V(Final result: - Mazly questions we did not ask)o This is the theoretical pproach.
In order to avoid manywrong paths in the derivation process, the implementationiB slightly different: it is possible to extract informationabout the substituent from the derivation tree and assignthe correct Q-value to the VAR, before the generative rulesapply.1?The shift-transformations also shift WH-elements andIrelatives.4/46;For Dutch, being an SOVqanguage, this type of shiftis not necessary for scope, since all Q-NPs can pre-cede NEG without shift (see section 1.2).
However,this type of shift should be done anyway in order togenerate both (15)a and (15)b as paraphrases of eachother:(15) a Jan geeft reel kinderen een snoepje.'
Jo lm-gives-many-chi ldren-a-sweet'b Veel kiuderen geeft Jan een snoepje.
'Many-chilclren-gives- John-a-swe t '(16)a and (16)b are also paraphrases of each other, but(17)a and (l~)b are not, considering condition 2b TM(16) a Jan heeft veel boeken niet gelezen.'
Jotm-has-many-books-not-read'b Veel boeken heeft Jan ulet gelezen.
'Many-bo ks-has- Jo lm-not-read'(17) a Jan heeft veel boeken gelezen.'
J olm-has-many-b o ok s-re ad 'b Veel boeken heeft Jan gelezen.
'Many-books-has- John-read'2.2 .4  Loosen ing  cond i t ionsAs I explained earlier (sect.ion i.3), in the SOV-language Dutch it is easier to express scope throughword order than in English and Spanish, especially ifthe sentence contains a negation.
In this section I willexplain how the conditions (a) and (b), stated in secotion 2.1 can be loosened in order to be able to translatea Dutch sentence with more than two VARs to the leftof NEG into Spanlsh/Euglish.In general it can be stated that Rneg and Rsubst canapply freely even if there is a free VA.R.
to the right, ifthis VAR is \[-S\].
Now there are two possibilities:- The VAI~ is definite.
The rules apply withoutrestrictions, x2- The VAR is a \[-S I Q-VAR.
In this case the surfaceorder which rejects scope order is pre/erred (of.
(4)).Now, this preference wil l  be handled in Rosetta bymeans of a so-called bonus system.
Every output ofa rule has a bonus 0.
Application of a rule can changethis value.
If there is more than one output, the bonusmerely determines the order in which the output sen-tences appear.XXThe reason behind these facts is that only an NP that isnot the focus, can topicalize without changing the meaning(or the theme/rheme relations~ /Suffer 1982/) of the sen-tence.
However, since a theory about focus is not availableyet in Rosetta, this is a way of either avoiding or makingcertain paraphrases of a sentence.
In fact, (17)b is a cor-rect paraphrase of (17}a in case vee/bo~ke~ is not focus, butnot in all cases.
In short, under the conditions given only aparaphrase is given if the topicalized argument has to be anon-focus element, namely in case the negation is the focus((16)b as paraphrase of (16)a) and in case another argu-ment as the one topicalized is focus ((15)b as paraphrase of(l~)a).x2R-L gsnsration in case of deflnitea is merely done forefficiency, in order to avoid unwanted ambiguities.Let me illustrate this process with an example.

The limit of scope~translation has been reached.3 Conc lus ionsIn this paper I showed how in Rosetta translation probolems with respect o scope can be solved to a certainextent by means of shift-transformations.
Since a solu..tion is not 'always possible if we want to strictly main~rain the surface order of Q-elements (and since on theother hand sentences are ambiguous anyway, particu-larly in SVO-languages like English and Spanish), rule~which break scope-order prescriptions apply anywaybut assigu a lower bonus.
This bonus has influence onthe output order of sentences.Acknowledgement  sI would like to thank the members of the Rosetta teamwho ga~'e their constructive comments on earlier ver~sions of this paper.ReferencesA.ppelo~ L. and Fellinger, C. and Landsbergen, J.
