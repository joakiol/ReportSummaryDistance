NARA: A Two-way Simultaneous Interl3retation Systembetween Korean and Jal~anese -A methodological study-\[lee Sung Chung and Tosiyasu L. KuniiDepartment of" Information ScienceFaculty of Science, University of Tokyo7-3-I Ilongo, Bunkyo-ku Tokyo, 113 JapanAbstr_~This paper presents a new computing model for con-structing a two-way simultaneous interpretation systembetween Korean and Japanese.
We also propose severalmethodological approaches to the construction of atwo-way simultaneous interpretation system, and real-ize the two-way interpreting process as a model unify-ing both linguistic competence and linguistic perfor-mance.
The model is verified theoretically andthrough actual applications.I.
IntroductionOur goal is to develop a two-way simultaneous in-terpretation system between Korean and Japanese.
Inorder to achieve this goal, we have designed a specif-ic computing model, which is a computer program basedon the a\]gorithll that formalizes the mechanism oftwo-way simultaneous interpretation and the correspon-dence of the two languages.
Our computational ap-proach consists of two parts?
First, build an explicitcomputational model, then sh(m the practical applica-biIity and theoretical validity of the model?
Themost significant advantage of using a formal descrip-.tion to represent our" system is in that the descrip-tive contents of the representative algoritb~ do notdepend upon the conventJ.orml approaches to machinetranslation?
~.Jc have also implemented a prototypint~system .\[~AR~.., a two-way simultaneous interpretationsystem between Korean and Japanese.
In this paper, weoutline the features of the system without \[4oin\[~ intothe details.2.
Methodologythe adjusted grammar with the interpretation mechan-ism: a representation, an a\]goritb~l, and a complexitymetric.
We take the following items as the subjects ofc;lethodological study.
(I) The theory of grammarWe require an adjusted grammar to be suitable fordescription of the two languages as input and output.It is intuitiw}ly clear that the more cc~,municatablethe adjusted gralr~imr is, expressed by a powerful for-real system, the more efficiently is the grammar inter-prcted.
We adopt general ized phrase structuregrarl,~lar (GPSG) framework\[\]{\].
(2) The notion of direct realization of interpretationBecause we need to connect competence and performanceas directly as possible, one of the goals of our studyis to identify rules of the grammar with the manipula-tive unit of interpretation in a one-to-one fashion?Thus we carefully distinguish between the grammar andthe rules of interpretation.
For this, we adopt thefollowing notions as the methodological principles ofour system:I) Equivalence of grammar\[5\]~ 2) gralfmlar cover' andgrarmlar modif:ieation\[6\]5 3) type transparency\[2\], and4) an invariant of forma\] languages\[4\].
(3) The notion of complexity measurefhe direct association between unit interpretationtime cost and the complexity of a sequential operationduring interpretation can be measured.Our approach is intuitively motivated by Cha~mky'shypothesis\[l\]: hc~logeneous communication by the samelinguistic performance is possible among those whohave the same linguistic competence.
We take a perfor-mance theory to be the study of real time processingof languages.
The performance theory cannot bedeveloped without a c~apetence theory.
This hy-pothesis suggests that a key point of contact betweenthe theory of grab, mr  and the interpretation controlis the natural link between the theory of knowledgerepresentation and the theory of knowledge proeessing.That is, for two classes of languages to be interpret-able by humaln being, there exists an interpreting pro-cedure.
Consequently, if we can show that there is anadjusted grab,far for the two languages plus an ade-quate interpreting procedure to predetermine themechanism of' our two-way simultaneous interpretation,then we have some support for our methodology.
Inorder to guarantee two-way simultaneous interpreta-tion, there are several subareas to be inquired.
Thefirst is the type of representation constructed duringthe interpretation.
The second is the method of util-izing the representation during the interpretation.The third is the measure of c~nputational complexityduring the interpretation.
These three components of acomplete c(~aputational model are necessary for linking3.
Linguistic Data Structure and Computing Modelin order to investigate the correspondence betweenthe two languages, we partition a grammar into in-dependent components: segmented words, the word order,morphology, syntax, and semantics.
The partition of agrammar constitutes an important step of modulardecomposition into the interpretation subsystems.3.1 Interpretation strategy of segmented word com-ponent3.1.1 Data structureIn comparison with other symbol system, every hmlanlanguage has a remarkable characteristics; namely, thestructure of segmented words.
The utterance as a seg-mented word conveys a message regarding some matter,and communicates the information concerning thematter.
A se\[~nented word is a word or an ordered pairof words.
Using some criteria: positional transforma-tion, substitution and insertion, we can specify asegmented word of Korean or Japanese.3.1.2 Word order in a segmented word of Korean orJapanese325Between Korean and Japanese, some common propertiesare observed, such as an agglutinative language struc-ture and the identical word order(SOV).
In addition,we sight three corresponding word order properties ofsegmented words between the two languages:For some (kl, k2) e:Sk and (jl, j2) eSj, where Sk andSj are a set of Korean segmented wordsj a set ofJapanese segmented words, respectively, and I a binaryrelation (interpretation) :\[Property I\] reflexivity(kl,k2) <I> (jl,j2).e.g.
0~ W <I> 4-~I q~l (our nation)\[Property 2\] synlnetry(jl,j2) <I> (k2,kl).e.g.~55 --/~<I> ~,}.~,,!
~1 (one more time)\[Property 3\] transitivity(jl,no,j2) <I> (k l , k2) .e.g.
Bako X <I> %t-t'~ ~ (a Japanese)~mong above properties, Property 3 depends upon Koreanpragmatic information.3.1.3 Computing modelThe production form of a se\[{nented word of Koreanor Japanese can be described in the rule forms in aregular granmar, and it is right linear.
Since alanguage L generated by some right linear grammar G isregular, there exists a finite automaton which acceptsL.
If L is a context-free language and s is a substi-tution map such that for every a e V(a fixed vocabu-lary), s(a) is a context-free language, then s(L) is acontext-free language.
A type of substitution mapthat is of special intcrest is a hc~mmorphiaa.
If' Li s  a regu lar  language and h i s  a hom~rJorphia~l, thenthe range of tile inverse homomorphism ff~(L) is alsoregular language.
And, for two given regular grammarsG and G', if L(G) : L(G'), there is a sequenceequivalence.
Two sequences generate the same word ord-er in the increasing length order.3.2 Interpretation strategy of Norphological component3.2.1.
Data structureThe study of the structure of words occupies an im-portant place within linguistics, sandwiched betweenphonology and syntax.
Horphemes may also be parti-tioned into lexical and grammatical classes.
Lexicalmorphemes are generally free, while many of the gram-matical morphemes are bound.3.2.2 C~nputing modelIn a given Korean-Japanese (or Japanese-Korean) dic-tionary, let Dk be the set of morphemes of Korean, andDj be the set of morphemes of Japanese.
A mapping Ibetween the sets is defined as follows.I(Dk) = Djimplying that the image of Dk is D j; taking the in-verse mapping,I(Dj) : Dk.By generalizing the relation and the mapping betweenthe two sets, we may consider the set of Korean wordsto be a domain, and the set of Japanese words a range.~ssuming the same cardinality for both, Dk and Dj maybe partitioned as shown below.
Here we suppose{I<I, k2,..kn}eDk, {jl, j2,..jm}eDj:(I) one-to-one (ki,ji) e DkxDj .

Interpretation ofthese relations depends on various factors: allomorph,synonym and homonym.
Thus, as for the interpretationwhich is dependent on synonymy or polysemy, we charac--terize the interpretation by specifying the canonicalform, or the semantic feature instantiation, respec-tively.3.3 Syntax level interpretation strategyWe examine the syntactic structure of the twolanguages.
Frcn~ the correspondence in a segTaented wordand word order, it is seen intuitively that they arestrongly equivalent.
And there is a sufficientlinguistic evidence for it based on the study of ex-perimental comparative linguistics\[2\].
~ phrase struc-ture preserves each lexical semantic feature of a con-stituent structure, and a parse tree describes theconstruction of syntactic representation of a sen-tence.
Horeover~ a partial tree in the whole parsetree plays a role of adjusting semantic and syntacticinterpretation.
Let us compare the examples of twoparse tree constructions(Fig I):VP VP.

This implies that two given languages, Koreanand Japanese, do not generate the same set of senten-tial forms.
Furthermore, there is no algorit~n fordeciding whether or not two given context-free gram-mars generate the same sentential forms.
This is thereason why we adopt the covering grar~ar technique toparse the source language for interpretation.3.4 Semantics, pra~aatics and ambiguitySemantics and pragmatics also play an importantrole in generating the well-formed target language.
Inthe interpretation between Korean and Japanese, thereexist several kinds of inherently ambiguous sentenceswhich are generated only by the ambiguous gralrmars of326both languages.
(see 5?Fragments of interpretation)4.
K-J Gr~nmarWe design the K-J (or J-K) grammar which elgninatessyntactical and semantical ambiguity of' both languagesfor interpretation?
This gra~m~mr corresponds to theccxnmunicative c~npetence for the interpretationbetween Korean and Japanese.
The K-J (J-K) grammar ismotivated by grammar modification and the coverinl\]grammar.ALGORITHM" irregularity categories removal or adjust-ment and semantic features insertion.Input: a 5-tuple phrase structure grammar G :(N,Tk,Tj, P,S).Output: an equivalent 5-tuple phrase structure gram-mar G' : (N',Tk'\[semj\],Tj',P',S').Method: entpirical and heuristic method?llere N and I~' are nontermina\].s, Tk, Tj, Tk' ancl T o 'are terminals, sem~ is semantic features, P and P' areproduction rules, ~nd S and S' are the start symbols?The J-K granmmr is designed analogously.
In theframc~vorl,: of the generalized phrase structure grammar,the semantic features are accepted by a special phrasestructure rule, that is a linking rule, which causesthe relevant information about the phrase to be passeddown the tree as a feature on the syntactic nodes.Therefore, interpretation procedure is constructed bya succinct algorithn founded on the K-J(J-K) grammar.5.
Fragments of IrlterpretationIn this section, we exhibit the frap~nents of ourintcrpretatJon system: how phrase structure rules andsemantic ?eatures interact in the interpretation pro-cedure aceordJ.ru;; to the K-.J(J-K) grai~lt/iai".5.1 \[Iomonymous constructionThere are some kinds of construction types providedby syntax relations of each constituent.
Among them,modificatiorl is a construction type related to Headand Attributes.
Coordination imp\].ies that more thantwo subconstituents have syntactical coordination re-.lation.
Let us consider the following Japanese utter-anoes :I )  t~2~.I-~,~ \[T\] ~>~<~o (modification"(Someone) goes to school, and eats bread.2) ~>99:< \[-c\] g*~-~9<o (coordination"(Someone) eats \[)read and goes to school.
'The two utterances imply the semantic notions ofmodification and coordination, respectively, but havethe same conjunction morpheme \[tel.
Semantically,they are represented in Korean by the outcome of in-terpretation as follows:I) ~d;,~?ll d*l ~'~~z '~#4=*:I.
(modification)2) ,,~.~-,-'\].,L q;,'-ol\] ",\]'-l. (coordination)Al l  such morpheme ambigu i t ies  induce not only  lex iea lsemantic ambiguity but sentential ambiguity, in orderto interpret such ambiguous utterances, we c~nploy se-mantic feature specification as the discipline of thesemantic conjunction schemata.
The foilowin{~ rulesaccount immediately for the sentences in the example.Here we use the GPSG notations:(I) modification schemaS-> \[l\[sem~0 , Conj *l \], lt\[\]semc~ 1\]where~Y~\[ (0,1),  (O,O) \](2) eoordinat:i .on schemaS -> \[i\[semrm , Conj .,'- \], II\[sem~l \]where~,(:{ (I,0), (1,1) \]5.2 Missing constructionKorean and Japanese allow one of" the constituentsof a sentence not to be explicitly stated when it isunderstandable fr~ll the context.

K - J ( J - k )  systemIn order  to de f ine  a two-way in terpretat ion  systemmore formally, we formulate the internal interfaee(K-Jsystem) for the interpretation.
This interfacecorresponds to the transducer of interpretation.
Wecan define the K-J(J-K) syster,; as a 3-tuple grammarG:(wj,k(or j),wk ), wherewk and w i are Korean words andJapanese words, respectively, and k(j) : Wi-~Wk ( Wk--~Wj )is a homomorphism.
The K-J(J-K) system G defines thefollowing sequence preserving the word order:w~-k(wD, w~w~=k(wDk(w~),.
....It also defines the languageL(Gk) = {ki(wi)li>O}.As mentioned above, the K-J(J-K) systel;L constitutes asimple device for interpretation.
A language definedby the K-J(J-K) systom corresponds to the targetlanguage.
Inversely, the mapping j of w~ into w i is suchthat the inverse homc{i~orphi~ij (wO = {wi lk (w i )  =w~} , j : kexists.
Thus, we define the two-way simultaneous in-terpretation system ~ by:j(Lk) :k ~(Lk) = {wilk(wj) eLk}.We can define our system ~ using the extended no-tion; the inverse homo~\]orphism can be replaced by thedirect operation of a finite substitution.
Considera gra\[~ar(e.g.
Korean) GK" = (Nk, Tk, Pk, Sk) and let jbe a finite substitution, defined on the vocabulary(Nk u Tk)*, such that j(w) is a finite(possibly empty)set of word for each word A.
We denotej(Nk) = \[~j, j(Tk) = Tj, PjDj(Pk), Sjnj(Sk).
Then,the gray, nat (e. g. Japanese)Gj = (Nj, Tj, Pj, Sj)is an interpretation of Gk.
If I(Gk), I(Cj) are thesets of all interpretation of Gk and G j, respectively,then I(G#') = I(Gj), and I is an invariant for Gk andGj.7.
Complexity of System NARAThe complexity of the algorithm is usually measuredby the growth rate of its time and space requirements,as a function of the size of its input (or the lengthof input string) to which the algorithm is applied.
Weadopt a finite state transducer as a computing modelwhich governs the fundamental interpretation control.Since we do not count the time it takes to read theinput, finite state languages have zero complexity.
Ifreading the input is counted, then finite languageshave time complexity of exactly A (the length of inputstring).
Such languages are interpretable in exactlytime it, and then called real-time languages.
The in-terpretation which is accompanied by co-occurrencedependency cannot be done in general without relyingon arbitrary look-ahead or rescanning of the output.However, the nature of on line interpretation is un-changeable.
Consequently, our system \]~R_& is inter-preted in real-time.8.
Concluding RemarksOur approach for constructing this system has bothlogical view and experimental view; the former isgiven by mathematical formalization, the latter by thecorrespondence of two languages.
In the view of compu-tational linguistics, we separated the mechanism ofour two-way simultaneous interpretation system intothe levels of abstract theory, algorit~ii, and imple-mentation to carve out the results at each level iramore independent f'ashion.
In order to do so, we speci-fied four important levels of description; the lowestlevel is morphology, the second level is se~lentedword, the third level is syntax and semantics, and thetop level controls the computing model of each level.Hence, we could determine the range of correspondencebetween internal representations of both grammars, andthe basic architecture of the machinery actually in-stantiates the algorithn.
Consequently, our model pro-duces the extra power by the proposed theory with mul-tiple levels of representation and systematic mappingbetween the corresponding levels of two languages, be-cause interpretation efficiency requires both func-tional and mathematical discussions.
Nevertheless, thecomplete pragmatic interpretation still remains quiteobscure.
Finally, we confront the proble~,~ whether itis possible to construct a two-way simuitaneous in-terpretation system between other two differentlanguage systems such as Japanese and English.
Wepresuppose that the key point of problem-solving is inthe study of universality and individuality betweentwo given languages.Acknowled  ~F~ientsWe are  deep ly  grate fu l  to Prof .
