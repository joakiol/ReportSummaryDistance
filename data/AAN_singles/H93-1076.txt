Speech and Text-Image Processing in DocumentsMarcia A. BushXerox Palo Alto Research Center3333 Coyote Hill RoadPalo Alto, CA 94304ABSTRACTTwo themes have volved in speech and text image processing workat Xerox PARC that expand and redefine the role of recognition tech-nology in d~ument-oriented appficafions.
One is the developmentof systems that provide functionality similar to that of text proces-sors but operate directly on audio and scanned image data.
A second,related theme is the use of speech and text-nnage r cognition to re-Irieve arbitrary, user-specified information from documents with sig-nal content.
This paper discusses three research initiatives at PARCthat exemplify these themes: a text-image editor\[I\], a wordspotterfor voice editing and indexing\[12\], and a decoding framework forscanned-document content retrieval\[4\].

INTRODUCTIONResearch on application of spoken language processing todocument creation and information retrieval has focused onthe use of speech as an interface to systems that operate pri-marily on text-based material.
Products of such work includecommercially available voice transcription devices, as wellas DARPA-sponsored systems developed to support speechrecognition and database interaction tasks (e.g., the ResourceManagement\[9\] andAir Travel Information Systems\[8\] tasks,respectively).
Similarly, work on text image processing hasfocused primarily on optical character recognition (OCR) asa means of transforming paper-based documents into manip-ulable (i.e., ASCH-based) electronic form.
In both cases, theparadigm is one of format conversion, in which audio or im-age data are converted into symbolic representations that fullydescribe the content and structure of the associated documentor query.Over the past few years, two themes have evolved in speechand text image processing work at Xerox PARC that expandand redefine the role of recognition technology in document-oriented applications.
The first of these is the developmentof systems that provide functionality similar to that of textprocessors but operate directly on audio and scanned imagedata.
These systems represent alternatives to the traditionalformat conversion paradigm.
They are based on a principle of1 Thanks to S. Bagley, R Chou, G. Kopec and L W'dcox for agreeing tohave their work discussed here.
"Ibis work ~ts  a sample, rather than a~!1 survey, of relevant speech and text-image research at PARC.partial document modeling, inwhich only enough signal anal-ysis is performed to accomplish the user's goal.
The systemsare intended to facilitate authoring and editing of documentsfor which input and output medium are the same.
Examplesinclude authoring of voice mail and editing of facsimile-baseddocument images.A second, and related, research theme is the use of speechand text-image r cognition to retrieve arbitrary, user-specifiedinformation from documents with signal content.
The focusis again on partial document models that are defined in onlyenough detail to satisfy task requirements.
Depending uponapplication, format conversion may or may not be a desiredgoal.
For example, in retrieving relevant portions of a lengthyaudio document via keyword spotting, a simple time indexis sufficient.
On the other hand, extracting numerical datafrom tabular images to facilitate on-line calculations requiresat least partial transcription i to symbolic form.This paper discusses three research initiatives at PARC thatexemplify these themes: atext-image editor\[l\], a wordspotterfor voice editing and indexing\[12\], and a decoding frameworkfor scanned-document content retrieval\[4\].
Overviews of thethree systems are provided in Sections 2 through 4, respec-tively; concluding comments are contained in Section 5.
Thediscussion focuses on key concepts embodied in the researchthat enable novel signal-based document processing function-ality.
Technical details of the individual efforts are describedin the associated references.2.
TEXT IMAGE EDITING: IMAGEEMACSImage EMACS is an editor for scanned ocuments in whichthe inputs and outputs are binary text images\[I\].
The primarydocument representation in Image EMACS is a set of imageelements extracted from scanned text through simple geomet-rical analysis.
These elements consist of groupings of con-nected components (i.e., connected regions of black pixels)\[2\]that correspond roughly to character images.
Editing is per-formed via operations on the connected components, usingediting commands patterned after the text editor EMACS \[11\].Image EMACS supports two classes of editing operations.376The first class is based on viewing text as a linear sequence ofcharacters, defined in terms of connected components.
Tradi-tional "cut and paste" functionality is enabled by a selectionof insertion and deletion commands (e.g., delete-character,kill-line, yank region).
As with text, editing is typically per-formed in the vicinity of a cursor, and operations toadjust cur-sor position are provided (e.g., forward-word, end-of-buffer).Characters can also be inserted by normal typing.
This isaccomplished by binding keyboard keys to character bitmapsfrom a stored font or, alternatively, to user-selected characterimages in a scanned ocument.
Correlation-based matchingof the character image bound to a given key against succes-sive connected-component groupings allows for image-basedcharacter search.The second class of operations supported by Image EMACSis based on viewing text as a two-dimensional arrangement ofglypbs on an image plane\[l\].
These operations provide typo-graphic functionality, such as horizontal nd vertical characterplacement, interword spacing, vertical line spacing, indenta-tion, centering and line justification.
Placement of adjacentcharacters i accomplished using font metrics estimated foreach character directly from the image\[5\].
These metricsallow for typographically acx.eptable character spacing, in-eluding character overlap where appropriate.Taken together, Image EMACS commands are intended toconvey the impression that the user is editing a text-baseddocument.
In actuality, the system is manipulating imagecomponents rather than character codes.
Moreover, whilethe user is free to assign character labels to specific imagecomponents, editing, including both insertion and search, isaccomplished without explicit knowledge of character iden-tity.
This approach enables interactive t xt-image editing andreproduction, i dependent of font or writing system.Figures 1 and 2 show an example of a scanned mnltilingualdocument before and after editing with Image EMACS.
Theexample demonstrates the results of image-based insertion,deletion, substitution and justification, as well as intermin-gling of text in several writing systems and languages (para-gapbs 4 through 7).
2 Such capabilities are potentially achiev-able using a format-conversion paradigm; however, this wouldrequire more sophisticated OCR functionality han currentlyexists, as well as access to fonts and stylistic information usedin rendering the original document.3.
AUDIO EDITING AND INDEXINGA second example of signal-based doeurnent processing isprovided by a wordspotter developed to support editing andindexing of documents which originate and are intended toremain in audio form\[12\].
Examples include voice mail, die-2Syntax and semantics are  not  neeessmily preserved in the example,thanks to the user's lack of familiarity with most of the languages involved.tated instructions and pre-recorded radio broadcasts or com-mentaries.
The wordspotter can also be used to retrieve rel-evant portions of less structured audio, such as recorded lec-tures or telephone messages.
In contrast with most previouswordspotting applications (e.g., \[15, 10\]), unconstrained key-word vocabularies are critical to such editing and indexingtasks.The wordspotter is similar to Image Ernacs in at least threeways: 1) it is based on partial modeling of signal content; 2) itrequires user specification fkeyword models; and 3 ) it makesno explicit use of linguistic knowledge during recognition,though users are free to assign interpretations to keywords.The wordspotter is also speaker or, more accurately, sound-source dependent.
These constraints allow for vocabularyand language independence, aswell as for the spotting ofnon-speech audio sounds.The wordspotter is based on hidden Markov models (HlVlM's)and is trained in two stages\[13\].
The first is a static stage, inwhich a short segment of the user's peech (typically 1minuteor less) is used to create a background, or non-keyword,HMM.
The second stage of t r ig  is dynamic, in that key-word models are created while the system is in use.
Modelspecification requires only a single repetition of a keywordand, thus, to the system user, is indistinguishable from key-word spotting.
Spotting is performed using a HMM networkconsisting of a parallel connection of the background modeland the appropriate keyword model.
A forward-backwardsearch\[13\] is used to identify keyword start and end times,both of which are required to enable diting operations suchas keyword insertion and deletion.The audio editor is implemented on a Sun MicrosystemsSparcstation a d makes use of its standard audio hardware.

DOCUMENT IMAGE DECODINGDocument image decoding (DID) is a framework for scanneddocument recognition which extends hidden Markov model-ing concepts to two-dimensional image data\[4\].
In analogywith the HMM approach to speech recognition, the decodingframework assumes a communication theory model based onthree dements: an image generator, a noisy channel and animage decoder.
Tbe image generator consists of a messagesource, which generates a symbol string containing the infor-marion to be cornrnunicated, and an imager, which formatsor encodes the message into an ideal bitmap.
The channeltransforms this ideal image into a noisy observed image byintroducing distortions associated with printing and scanning.The decoder estimates the message from the observed im-age using maximum a posteriori decoding and a Viterbi-likedecoding algorithm\[6\].377A key objective being pursued within the DID framework isthe automatic generation ofoptimized ecoders from explicitmodels of message source, imager and channel\[3\].
The goalis to enable application-oriented users to specify such modelswithout sophisticated knowledge of image analysis and recog-nition techniques.
It is intended that both the format and typeof information returned by the document decoder be under theuser's control.
The basic approach is to support declarativespecification of a priori document infomation (e.g., page lay-out, font metrics) and task constraints via formal stochasticgrarnmars.Figures 3 through 5 illustrate the application of DID to theextraction of subject headings, listing types, business namesand telephone numbers from scanned yellow pages\[7\].
Aslightly reduced version of a sample scanned yellow pagecolumn is shown in Figure 3 and a finite-state op-level sourcemodel in Figure 4.
The yellow page column includes asubjectheading and examples of several different listing types.
These,in turn, are associated with branches of the source model.
Thefull model contains more than 6000 branches and 1600 nodes.Figure 5 shows the result of using a decoder generated from themodel to extract the desired information from the yellow pagecolumn.
Automatically generated decoders have also beenused to recgnize avariety of other document types, includingdictionary entries, musical notation and baseball box scores.5.
SUMMARYThe speech and text-image r cognition i itiatives discussedin the preceding sections illustrate two research themes atXerox PARC which expand and redefine the role of recog-nition technology in document-oriented applications.
Theseinclude the development of editors which operate directlyon audio and scanned image data, and the use of speechand text-image r cognition to retrieve arbitrary informationfrom documents with signal ccontent.
Key concepts embod-ied in these research efforts include partial document models,task-oriented document recognition, user specification andintepretation f recognition models, and automatic genera-tion of recognizers from declarative models.
These conceptsenable the realization of a broad range of signal-based dec-ument processing operations, including font, vocabulary andlanguage-independent editing and retrieval.References1.
