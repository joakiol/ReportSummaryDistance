IntroductionThe main problems arising with thedevelopment of an information retrieval systemfor the Japanese text are the need for, savingman-power, standardizing information storage,and the realization of efficient retrieval.In the case of the English text, the stop-wordremoving method for automatic keywordextraction has been put to practical use.However, in the case of the Japanese text whichconsists of KanJi and Kana characters, akeyword extraction method utilizing statisticalword frequency data has been reported by aKyoto University group.3 This paper proposesa new method of automatic keyword extractionand "role" setting for Japanese newsinformation retrieval.
The "role" characterizessemantic identification of each keyword in asentence and is classified into six categories,i.e., human subject, human object, time, place,action, and miscellaneous importantinformation.The main features of Japanese sentences can becharacterized as follows:(I) The structure of a sentence is determinedby the noun-predicate verb dependency.
(2) The case indicating words(kaku-joshi) playan important role in deep case structure.Taking these features into account, D.G.Hays'sdependency grammar I and C.J.
Fillmore's casegrammar 2 arc utilized in the sentencestructure analysis.
The sentence pattern tablecontaining a noun-predicate verb dependencyrelationship plays an important function inthe analysis.
By utilizing the meaning of anoun as it depends on each predicate verb,restricted semantic processing becomespossible.
An automatic indexing system5,equipped with a man-machine interactiveerror-correcting function, has been developedbased on the method described.
Evaluation ofthe system has been done by applying it in newsinformation retrieval.2.
Role Settin~ CriteriaThe employed criteria for the role settingof each keyword in a news sentence are asfol lows :(I) "Action"(A for short) is assigned to verbswhich express movement and are elementsof the "predicate" set.
(2) "Time"(T for short) can be assigned withoutambiguity.
(3) "Human subject"(ES for short), "humanobject"(EO for short), "place"(P for short)and "miscellaneous important information"(Y~I for short) arc assigned to noun wordsaccording to the following criteria:(a) Words which express humans or organizationshave either role "HS" or "riO".
Thedistinction can be made by examining thesubsequent kaku- joshi.
(b) Words which express things withoutconsciousness have role "If!".
(c) A country name has role "HS" if it ispresumed to have consciousness as anorganization.
It has role "P" if itmeans territory.
(d) An airplane or a ship have role "IIS"when they are personified together withthe driver, role "P" when they expressthe place, and role "MI" when they meanthings.
(e) Ambiguities in item (c) and (d) areremoved by knowing which predicate verbthe word depends on and this determinewhich human, organization, place ormiscellaneous matter it expresses.514To clarify the description, some exa~uplesare given below:ex.1) "State A"ga "State B"wo shihai.suru.HS HO A (control)<State A controls State B.>In this sentence "ga" and "wo" arekaku-joshis.ex.2) '~tate A"ga "H-Sea"wo shihai-suru.HS P A<State A controls M-Sea.>ex.3) "StateA"ga "petroleum'h~oHS MIshihai-suru.A<State A controls petroleum.>ex.4) ".~solationism"ga "State A"woMI IlOshihai-suru.A<Islationism controls State A.>(4) As mentioned above the "role" of a nounword is determined by considering thefollowing three elements: i.e.,(a) the predicate verb whieh the noun worddepends on(b) the meaning of the noun word(c) the kaku-joshi which is concatenated tothe noun word3.
Japanese Sentence Structure AnalysisThe basic Japanese sentence pattern isexpressed as "NFINF2--NFnPV" , whereNFi, which is called "meishi-bunsetsu", iscomposed of a noun word and case indicatingwords, and where PV is a predicate verb.The Japanese sentence structure ischaracterized by the following points, i.e.,(I) The predicate verb is put at the end ofthe sentence?
(2) The position of a "meishi-bunsetsu" in asentence is not fixed.
(3) A "meishi-bunsetsu" could be omitted ina discourse which consists of severalsentences.Utilizing D.G.
Hays's dependency grammar,noun-predicate verb dependency relationshipsare formulated.
In this formulation therelationships between nouns are irrelevant.Therefore, the Japanese sentence structurebecomes independent of noun-word order, anda word omission is expressed in terms of thepresence of a dependency relationship in thesentence.
Since "role" is semanticidentification of a word, by applyingC.J.Fillmore's case grammar 2, it can beassigned to each keyword by clarifying the casestructure of the predicate verb.
(Figure I) InJapanese sentence structure analysis, thepredicate verb is identified first and thendependent noun words are determined in orderof nearness to the predicate verb.
The sentenceis parsed by using top-down analysis.
Thebottom-up method is not adopted because itcauses much ~nbiguity in the parsing of wordswhich do not directly depend on the predicateverb.
The need for classification of noun wordsin terms of their meaning is mentioned inchapter 2.
Noun words are classified into sevensemantic classes in order to analyzenoun-predicate verb dependency relationshipsefficiently and to set "role"s to them, i.e.,(i) Organization (ii) Person(iii) Literature (iv) Place (v) Action(vi) Name of matter, Abstract idea, etc.
(vii) TimePredicate verbs are classified by taking intoaccount the meaning of the dominated words andtheir cases.
(Figure 2) The sentence patterntable is constructed based on this predicateverb classification.
(Figure 3)In the news retrieval system, about 5600predicate verbs are classified into 586classes; this classification is calledcase-information(A4-code).
The sentencepattern table contains 1686 patterns.
ASentence pattern in the table is composed offour triplets at most.
Elements of the tripletare the semantic class identification code ofthe noun word, kaku-joshi, and the "role" whichis determined in terms of the values of thefirst two elements.For example "shihai-suru"(control) and"kogeki-suru"(attaek) belong to No.46 category.The predicate verb of this category has sixsentence patterns and each sentence patternhas two triplets.
The first sentence patternhas triplets (ga,A, 1) and (wo, I,2).
The firstcode of the triplet is "kaku-joshi", the secondI) Freedom in the position of "meishi-bunsetsu"Japanese Surfase 2) Omissibility of "meishi-bunsetsu" in a discourseSentence Characteristics 3) "Meishi-bunsetsu" is composed of a noun-word and case indicatingwor ds ?Surfase Sentence Structure <meishi-bunsetsu> I ..... <meishi-bunsetsu>n<predicate verb>Happing(=role) I I  uman Su \~ ~bject  ~ laceDeep Case Structure \] Case Relation (\[Agentive\],\[Objectivo\],\[Locative\] ......... )Figure I Relationship between Surfase Case Structure and Deep Case Structure in Japanese Sentence--515code is the semantic classification code of thenoun word, and the third code is the "role".Semantic classification code "A" expressesorganization or person.Sentence analysis and "role" setting areperformed referring to this sentence patterntable.~., Automatic Indexin~ SystemAn automatic indexing system has beendeveloped based on the method described.

Evaluation of the SystemThe system has been evaluated by applyingit to news information retrieval.
The resultsof this application show, that, based on theassumption that the content word dictionaryand the sentence pattern table cover 90% ofthe processed words and processed sentencepatterns, 85 to 90% of the keywords and 80 to85% of the set roles extracted are estimatedto be correct.
Also, the time required forindexing is only one third of that requiredfor conventional manual inde~ng, and theretrieval precision-ratio is improved by 20to 30% without affecting the recall-ratio~ Withthis method the turn- arround time forinformation storage is reduced to half of thatof the conventional manual method.
