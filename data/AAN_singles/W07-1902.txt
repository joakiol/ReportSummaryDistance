readiness to en-gage in collaborative elaboration of jointlyconstructed proposals.1 IntroductionBackchannel utterances are one of the representa-tive phenomena characterizing conversational inter-actions.
We can find backchannel utterances in ev-ery natural conversation in every culture.
Differ-ent languages have different repertoire of expres-sions that work as backchannels.
In terms of whatfunctions they serve in conversations, it has widelybeen acknowledged that backchannels, by convey-ing the hearer feedback to the speaker, serve to con-tribute to informational coordination between con-versational participants, through conversational flowmanagement in terms of both common groundingand smooth turn-taking.
It has also been acknowl-edged, perhaps less explicitly, that backchannelsserve to contribute to affective coordination by pro-moting rapport between conversational participants.It is still unclear how these two contrasting views onbackchannels can be integrated.
How are the infor-mational and the affective coordination functions ofbackchannels inter-related?
What factors determinerelative salience of these two functions in certain us-age of backchannels?
Are there any categories ofconversational interactions that promote one or theother functions?
Are there cultural differences inbackchannel usages?We focus, in this paper, on the use of Japanesebackchannels, aiduti, in multi-party conversations.Based on the analysis of how aiduti utterances areemployed in experimentally captured multi-partydesign conversation data, we argue that aiduti ut-terances in Japanese have, on top of the informa-tional coordination functions of common-groundingand turn-management, the function of expressing thereadiness, a positive attitude, on the part of a partic-ipant to engage in the joint construction of an ongo-ing proposal currently under discussion, which thenleads to affective coordination.2 Backchannels in DialoguesBackchannel utterances were conceived initiallyin two-party dialogues with one speaker and onehearer.
Schegloff (1982) picked up hearer?s shortutterances such as ?uh, huh?
produced in responseto the speaker?s main utterances, and character-ized them as backchannels, whose functions are toconvey backward messages from the hearer to thespeaker indicating that the hearer is attending to, lis-tening to, understanding, and expecting to continuethe production of the speaker?s main message.Heritage (2006) provides a broader conception ofbackchannels and lists the following four functions9Figure 1: Meeting archiver equipment MARC usedin data collectionfor backchannel utterances.?
Provide Acknowledgments to prior locutionsby the speaker?
Projection of further talk in turn taking?
Recipient epistemic states triggered by thespeaker?s message?
Recipient affiliative attitude, how the recipientis aligned with speaker?s messageMaynard (1986) compared Japanese and Amer-ican dialogues, and observed that Japanese dia-logues have almost twice as much aizuti as Ameri-can backchannel utterances.
This observation sug-gests that significance of backchannels and theirfunctions in conversational interactions may dependon social groups, types of activities and other socialor task related parameters.3 Multi-party Conversation3.1 Varieties of multi-party conversationsWewill focus on aiduti utterances in Japanese multi-party design conversations.
In order to locate thetype of activity we?ve been working on within thebroad range of interaction activities collectively cat-egorized as multi-party conversations, we first try tolist up potential parameters that might influence theFigure 2: Setting for multi-party design conversationcapturestructure and organization of conversational interac-tions.Number of participantsWe call a conversation between more than twopeople a multi-party conversation.
A conversationbetween three people and a conversation between 10people are not the same in their conversational orga-nization.
It has been observed (Fay et al, 2000) thatconversations with a small number of participantstend to be homogeneous that contain a number ofequal status pairwise interactions, whereas conver-sations with a large number of participants tend tobe more hierarchical with a central control personworking as a chairperson.Types of activitiesConversational interactions are often embedded inlarger activities, and the type of embedding activitiesmakes a difference in the organization of conversa-tions.
(a) PurposeOne-way information transfer in lectures andjoint problem solving in a group of people haveboth fixed but different types of goals.
Whenpeople chat for socialization, having a conver-sation itself becomes its own purpose.
Thesedifferent types of goals could produce differentorganizational structures in conversations.
(b) Rigidity of purposeEven within joint problem solving activities,10Sp Utterance Sp UtteranceD: ??

: (convert speech into text)Figure 3: Aiduti in design conversationwe can conceive of different degree of rigid-ity of problem goals conversational participantsare working on.
In one extreme lies a pursuitof a fixed goal such as mathematical problemsolving, in which a problem with a clearly de-termined answer is given to the group.
In otherextreme lies a problem solving under a looselystated goal such as floor planning of an apart-ment for the group, in which the only require-ment is to reach an agreement, and factors toconsider must be made explicit in the course ofconversation.
The design conversation we?velooked at belong to the latter category.

(d) Use of objectsUse of physical objects, particularly informa-tional artifact such as whiteboard and projec-tors, changes the use pattern of multi-modalsignals: gaze, gestures and body postures, andneeds to be taken into account in experimentaldata collection.Characteristics of participants(a) Participant propertiesDifferences in capabilities such as in knowl-edge and in expertise, and dispositional proper-ties, such as preferences, beliefs, and personal-ities of participants greatly contribute to shapethe interaction.
(b) Participant roles11Start -End Sp Utterances243.1950-243.7450 F: are-wo- (that)244.2075-246.1200 F: tatoeba keitai-wo nakusita toki-nosono- (when you lose your mobile phone)246.6300-247.9800 F: timei-tekina doai-wa- (how fatal it will be)248.2725-248.8850 F: nn daibu- (big)248.7550-249.7350 B: un:249.3000-250.0200 E: un:249.5150-249.8225 D: un:250.1250-254.8225 F: un:are ikko otosityattaraironna houmen-no raihu-rain-ga soredakede tataretyautte iunogaatte- (if you lose one, your life line willbe cut out in a lot of ways)Figure 4: Aiduti overlapConversation setting often dictates certain roleassignment to each participant, which in turndetermines the shape of interactions that takesplace between people under those participantroles.
Instructor and follower in instruction giv-ing tasks, and clerk and customer in commer-cial transactions are typical examples.
The roleof chairperson also is significant in determiningthe structure of conversations.
(c) Participant relationshipsAge and social status often provide a fixed basefor dominance relationship among conversa-tional participants.
Affiliative familiarity be-tween participants are less fixed but still stablerelationships.
Sharing of opinions is temporaryand can change quite quickly during the courseof a conversation.3.2 Multi-party design conversationWe have been collecting data on multi-party designconversation in Japanese.
Multi-party design con-versation is a type of joint problem solving conversa-tion, in which participants engage in a discussion tocome up with an agreement on the final design plan.The design goal, however, is only partially specified,and participants need to jointly decide on evaluativecriteria for the design goal during the course of thediscussion.Start -End Sp Utterance781.5050-781.6100 C: ?781.7750-782.7050 C: ???????????

1.
MARC is equipped with an ar-ray of 6 cameras together with an array of 8 mi-crophones, and it captures panoramic video withup to 15 frames/sec.
and speaker-separated speechstreams with 16kHz sampling rate.
A meeting cap-ture scene is shown in Fig.
2.The data we examine in this paper consists of one30 minutes conversation conducted by 5 males and1 female.
Even though we did not assign any roles, achairperson and a clerk were spontaneously electedby the participants at the beginning of the session.4 Aizuti in multi-party design conversation4.1 Aiduti types and amountsWe first looked at how frequent people produceaiduti in the conversation.
Table 1 shows the numberof utterances and aiduti utterances for each of the sixspeakers, both in terms of the number of inter-pausalunits (IPUs).
Table 2 indicates expressions identifiedas aiduti utterances.
Positive responses to questionsand requests are not included in aiduti, even if theyshare the surface forms of Table 2.
Reduplicatedforms of each of the aiduti expressions in Table 2are also frequently observed, and they were countedas one aiduti occurences.We can see that a sizable portion of utterances,about 30% to 40%, were actually aiduti utterancesin our data.
An example excerpt demonstrating theabundance of aiduti is shown in Fig.
3, where aidutiutterances are marked by bold characters.4.2 Conversation flow managementOverlapping aidutiOne reason why multi-party conversation con-tains a lot of aiduti is that there are more hearers,potential backchannel producers.
Fig.
4 shows anexample in which three hearers B,E, and D producedaiduti almost simultaneously to the speaker F?s ut-terance.
The fact that these three aiduti were over-lapping shows that they are independently directedto the speaker F?s preceding utterance.
This type ofaiduti response is expected to increase in numbers asthe number of conversation participants increases.Aiduti for turn-holdingIn the same example in Fig.
4, the speaker F pro-duced aiduti ?un?
after all aiduti utterances by hear-ers B, E, and D, and immediately before he con-tinued his turn.
This type of speaker aiduti can betaken to serve the turn-holding function.
It gives anacknowledgment to all the acknowledgments fromhearers collectively and signals that the speaker isgoing on producing his own message.Aiduti for floor transitionA relatively clear structure was observed in theconversation we analyzed.
The conversation con-sisted of a sequence of idea proposals produced by13Aiduti?Floor NumAiduti speaker becomes the next floor main speaker 53non-Aiduti speaker becomes next floor main speaker 17Total 70Table 3: Aiduti and floor transitiondifferent speakers.
We identified a stretch of conver-sation as a floor in which one main speaker makesa proposal on his or her ideas.
As long as the spe-cific proposal is being discussed as the conversationtopic, other participants may contribute clarificationor elaboration utterances within the same floor.
Anexample of a sequence of floors is shown in Fig.
5.C first talks about the difference in people?s expectedresponse between mobile mails and PC mails in thefirst floor.
B then brings about in the second floora suggestion on some functionality similar to drivemode which indicates to the original sender that therecipient is not available at the moment.
D in thethird floor follows on by mentioning Yahoo messen-ger.
We extracted 71 floors total from the 30 minuteconversation data.Table 3 indicates the relationship between the pro-duction of aiduti in one floor and the claiming ofthe main speaker-hood in the next floor.
The tableshows that many of the main speaker of a floor hadproduced aiduti as a non-main speaker in the preced-ing floor.
This suggests that aiduti utterances fromnon-main speakers indicate their readiness to makea positive contribution to the joint task, by taking thenext floor and by contributing a proposal for the taskwhen they find a suitable opportunity.4.3 Collaborative elaboration of proposalsWhen we take a closer look into floors, we find pos-itive collaborative behaviors from non-main speakerparticipants.
Typical behaviors of non-main speakerparticipants of a floor include giving aiduti, pro-viding (positive) evaluations to the idea proposed,and inserting clarification questions.
On top ofthese behaviors, it was often observed in a floor thatnon-main speaker participants try to make positivecontributions to the idea currently on the table, byadding new elements of ideas or providing concreteideas to part of the proposal that heretofore remainedvague at the time.

Collaborative elaboration can be a suc-cess or a failure.
Figures 6 and 7 show two con-trasting examples.
In the example in Fig.
6, non-main speaker participants C and B successfully con-tribute to the idea proposal by the main speaker D oncombining PC and Skype functionalities, by explic-itly pointing out the concrete merit, e.g., free phonecall, as a support of the proposal.
In the example inFig.
7, on the other hand, a non-main speaker par-ticipant B first tried to make a contribution, the ideaof local data backup, to the proposal produced bythe main speaker C, storage of data in the network,but gave up after a non-positive response from C andretracted his additional proposal.Table 4 shows the relationship between collab-orative evaluation and aiduti utterances in a floor.Aiduti utterances were observed in almost everyfloor.
Collaborative elaboration is also rather fre-quent.
It takes place in about 40% of all floors.
Fi-nally, the table shows that participants who performcollaborative evaluation in a floor are likely to pro-duce aiduti utterances in the same floor.
This sug-gests, again, that aiduti utterances from non-mainspeaker participants of a floor indicate their readi-ness to make a positive contribution to the joint task,by improving on the proposal currently being dis-cussed.5 DiscussionsFrequency of aiduti utterancesWe observed that multi-party conversations con-tain a high rate (30?40%) of aiduti utterances.
agreat number of aiduti utterances were produced bythe chairperson among all the participants.
Saft(2006), based on the analysis of Japanese TV dis-cussion programs, pointed out that chairperson pro-15duces a large portion of aiduti among all the discus-sion participants.
These findings appear to confirmthe idea that aiduti utterances have functions to man-age the flow of conversations, and chairpersons ex-ploit these functions in discussion sessions.
But, ex-act conversation flow management function of aidutimay not be unique.
According to Saft (2006), thechairperson in the particular TV discussion programuses aiduti to claim their addressee-hood in order toprevent the discussion from free-floating and out ofcontrol.
In our design conversation data, it appearsthat the chairperson frequently inserts aiduti in or-der to encourage other participants to engage in thediscussion and to make the session more lively.Floor structureIt may not always be a good strategy for ev-erybody to produce aiduti as acknowledgment in amulti-party conversation, since with a lot of hearersit can be a nuisance for the speaker to get too manyaiduti in every possible grounding point.
It followsthat the fact that a certain participant produces aidutiat a certain timing in a multi-party conversation canhave significance other than the grounding of themessage just produced.
It is interesting to note thateven though at the level of turn-taking, an aiduti ut-terance works as a continuer, a turn-yielding signal,at the level of floor, aiduti utterances seem to indi-cate positive involvement attitude of the participanttoward the joint problem solving activity.Collaborative elaborationWe observed a number of instances of joint con-struction of proposals through collaborative elabo-ration in our design conversation data.
It was alsoobserved that in most of the cases of collaborativeelaboration, aiduti utterances were accompanied byparticipants engaging in collaborative elaboration.These facts seem to imply that aiduti utterances bothsignal and produce among conversation participantsan affiliative awareness toward joint construction ofthe proposal for the problem at hand, through theexchange of readiness signal, among all the groupmembers, toward making positive contributions tothe ongoing joint problem solving activity.
We be-lieve that these contribution readiness and affilia-tive awareness are the basis of affective functions ofaiduti in Japanese conversations.6 ConclusionsAn analysis of aiduti utterances, Japanese backchan-nels, in a Japanese multi-party design conversationwas conducted.
It was argued, based on the analysis,that, in addition to the two major functions, signal-ing acknowledgment and turn-management, aidutiutterances in multi-party conversations are involvedin joint construction of design plans through man-agement of the floor structure, and display of par-ticipants?
readiness to engage in collaborative elab-oration of jointly constructed proposals.
It was alsosuggested that these additional functions eventuallylead to affective functions of aiduti.AcknowledgmentThe work reported in this paper was partially sup-ported by Japan Society for the Promotion ofScience Grants-in-aid for Scientific Research (B)18300052.ReferencesFutoshi Asano and Jun Ogata.
