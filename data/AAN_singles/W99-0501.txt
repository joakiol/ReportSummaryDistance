complementary methods (a)heunstms, (b) conceptual dens,ty, and (c) staus-tins on large corpora The first two methods relyenurely on the mfolmaUon contained m WordNet,while the th,rd one uses other

entrance#3,  the head of the fiist phrase, is ahype~n)m of zntruszon, thus we pick sense 3 ofnoun entrance (The senses in Wo2dNet a2e ,ankedacco, dmg to then frequency ot occmrence m theBrown corpus, ent rance#3 means sense 3 of wo, dentrance )2 Class Lmgmst lc  Paral lehsmIt 2s hkel?

In %?ordNet 1 6 there is a synset {scuff#l, drag},thus verb scuff Is dlsamblguated4 Class.

\[wlrw2\] ---- \[force way\] The gloss of {way#9}contains the example (2 'I had xt my way' '), pro-vldmg the lexlcal relation \[w3rw2\] = \[have way\]?
Noun way is dxsamblguated (sense 9), and verbshave#7 and fo rce#9 have a common hypernym,therefore verb fo rce  ~s also dlsambiguated5 C lass  Co l locat ionsNouns representing actions ate nommahzatmns ofsome verbs If a verbal collocation contains a noun,and is also a s~ nonym of some mo, phologmally re-lated verb, then ,t is likely to be the nommahza-tlon source The verb from the gloss of a synonymdescribing an actmn, ff not the source of the noml-nahzaUon is hkely to belong to the same hmtarchyas the true nommahzatlon source, since they mustshare some propertiesEzample Let s = {escape ,  f l ight} ,  with thegloss ( the ac t  of escap ing  phys ica l ly )?
The ~erb escape Is morphological ly identical tothe noun escape  from synset s?
Sense 1 of verb escape  has a hypernym collocationusmg noun f lxght  from s, thus is selected6 C lass  Lex~cal Re la t ,ons%.

We have \[wlrw2\] - \[ald to slave\]?
The gloss of {ald#4} is (ald to someone)?
