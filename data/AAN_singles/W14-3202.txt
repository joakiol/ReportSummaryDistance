Thisnew setting is a departure from face-to-face therapy, and offers both a challengeand an opportunity ?
it is not yet knownwhat features or approaches are likely tolead to successful outcomes in such a dif-ferent medium, but online text-based ther-apy provides large amounts of data for lin-guistic analysis.
We present an initial in-vestigation into the application of compu-tational linguistic techniques, such as topicand sentiment modelling, to online ther-apy for depression and anxiety.
We findthat important measures such as symptomseverity can be predicted with compara-ble accuracy to face-to-face data, usinggeneral features such as discussion topicand sentiment; however, measures of pa-tient progress are captured only by finer-grained lexical features, suggesting thataspects of style or dialogue structure mayalso be important.1 IntroductionMental illnesses such as depression and anxietyhave been called ?the biggest causes of miseryin Britain today?
(Layard, 2012).
The main av-enue of treatment for such conditions is talkingtherapies, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy(CBT); however, there is far greater demand thancan currently be met, and currently only 25% ofsufferers in the UK receive treatment.
Therapy istherefore increasingly being delivered online: this?This work was partly supported by the ConCreTe project.The project ConCreTe acknowledges the financial supportof the Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) programmewithin the Seventh Framework Programme for Research ofthe European Commission, under FET grant number 611733.helps to improve access and reduce waiting times,and is just as effective as standard therapy (Kessleret al., 2009).
However, this new online settingprovides a challenge of evaluation and optimisa-tion (Hanley and Reynolds, 2009; Beattie et al.,2009).
Online therapy is a significant departurefrom face-to-face therapy, and it is not yet knownexactly what features or approaches are likely tolead to successful outcomes, or help identify neg-ative outcomes such as risk to the patient or oth-ers.
Current methods (e.g.
controlled studies) areexpensive and time-consuming; we need fast, ac-curate methods to ensure treatment can be madeeffective and efficient in this new context.Professional communication varies widely(McCabe et al., 2013b) and aspects of doctor-patient interaction and language are known toinfluence outcomes such as patient satisfaction,treatment adherence and health status (Ong etal., 1995; McCabe et al., 2013a).
For therapists,automated methods to analyse therapist-clientcommunication are of interest as there is littleknown about how the quality of communicationinfluences patient outcome.
Identifying patternsof effective communication ?
both in termsof what is spoken about and how it is spokenabout ?
would help guide training of therapists.Moreover, it may assist in identifying successfultherapy and perhaps, more importantly, wherecommunication is not therapeutic and patients arefailing to improve.
This may warrant a different ormore intensive therapeutic intervention.
Applyingcomputational linguistic techniques to therapydata could therefore offer potential to producetools which can aid clinicians in predicting out-comes, diagnosing severity of symptoms and/orevaluating progress.
Recent work on spokentherapy dialogue has shown promising results in arange of mental health tasks, including diagnosisof post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) anddepression (DeVault et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013),7and prediction of outcomes in schizophreniatreatment (Howes et al., 2013).Online therapy data provides a new challenge?
language and interaction styles differ to face-to-face ?
but also an opportunity in the availabil-ity of large amounts of text data without the needfor automatic speech recognition or manual tran-scription.
Here, we present an initial investiga-tion into the application of computational linguis-tic techniques to online therapy for depression andanxiety.
We find that important measures such assymptom severity can be predicted with compara-ble accuracy to face-to-face data, and that generalaspects such as discussion topic and sentiment areuseful predictors; and suggest some ways in whichtechniques can be adapted for improved perfor-mance in future.2 Background2.1 Computational analysis & mental healthResearch into computer-based diagnosis in mentalhealth goes back at least to the 1960s ?
see (Over-all and Hollister, 1964; Hirschfeld et al., 1974)amongst others ?
but most systems rely on doctor-or patient-reported data rather than naturally oc-curring language.
Much recent work similarlyuses self-reported clinical and socio-demographicdata, e.g.
to predict treatment resistance in depres-sion (Perlis, 2013).
Some recent natural languageprocessing (NLP) research examines features ofthe language used by patients when discussingconditions or treatment, e.g.
discovering topicsand opinions from online doctor ratings (Paul etal., 2013) or social media (Paul and Drezde, 2011).However, aspects of the communication dur-ing treatment itself are also associated with pa-tient outcomes (Ong et al., 1995).
In the mentalhealth domain, recent work suggests that, for pa-tients with schizophrenia both conversation struc-ture (how communication proceeds in therapy),and content (what is talked about), can affect out-comes (McCabe et al., 2013a; John et al., underreview).
NLP research has now begun to examineboth.
Wallace et al.
(2013) model speech acts tocharacterise doctor-patient consultations on medi-cation adherence; Angus et al.
(2012) use unsuper-vised topic models to visualise shared content inclinical dialogue; Cretchley et al.
(2010) use a sim-ilar approach for a qualititative analysis of topicand communication style between patients withschizophrenia and carers.
DeVault et al.
(2013)use features of speech, and Yu et al.
(2013) mul-timodal features, from video-mediated dialogue todetect depression and PTSD with promising accu-racies (0.66 to 0.74 depending on condition andtask).
In face-to-face therapy for schizophrenia,Howes et al.
(2012; 2013) use a combination ofsupervised and unsupervised approaches to pre-dict a range of diagnostic and outcome measures,including future adherence to treatment (accuracy0.70); fine-grained lexical features gave reason-able accuracy, with more general topic featuresgiving weaker prediction of some outcomes.2.2 Topic modellingOne focus of research for mental health is there-fore on methods for analysing content (what istalked about).
Traditional methods, while ef-fective, involve time-consuming hand-coding ofdata (Beattie et al., 2009; John et al., under re-view); NLP techniques can reduce this require-ment.
Unsupervised probabilistic models (e.g.
La-tent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Blei et al.
(2003)and variants) have been widely applied to learntopics (word distributions) from the data itself,connecting words with similar meanings and evendistinguishing between uses of words with mul-tiple meanings (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007).Such techniques have been applied successfullyto structured dialogue e.g.
meetings and tuto-rials (Purver et al., 2006; Eisenstein and Barzi-lay, 2008), and more recently to dialogues in theclinical domain (Cretchley et al., 2010; Howes etal., 2013), with topics found to identify importantthemes within therapy conversation such as medi-cation, symptoms, family and social issues, and tocorrelate with outcomes.2.3 Sentiment and emotion analysisOne aspect of conversation process and style isthe affect or emotion present.
NLP research hasgenerally approached this via the task of senti-ment detection, distinguishing positive from neg-ative (and sometimes neutral) stance (Pang andLee, 2008).
Methods generally take either aknowledge-rich approach (relying on e.g.
dictio-naries of sentiment-carrying words (Pennebakeret al., 2007)), or a data-rich approach via (usu-ally supervised) machine learning over datasets ofsentiment-carrying text (e.g.
Socher et al.
(2013)).The former can provide deeper insights, but areless robust in the face of unexpected vocabulary,unusual or errorful spelling; the latter are more ro-8bust but require training from large datasets.
Re-cent research has attempted finer-grained distinc-tions, e.g.
detecting specific emotions such asanger, surprise, fear etc; again, approaches canbe characterised as dictionary-based or machine-learning-based (Chuang and Wu, 2004; Seol et al.,2008; Purver and Battersby, 2012; De Choudhuryet al., 2012).
The resulting sentiment or emotionratings have been widely used to determine as-pects of personality and mental state in various do-mains.
In social media text, Quercia et al.
(2011;2012) found correlations between sentiment andlevels of popularity, influence and general well-being; O?Connor et al.
(2010) with measures ofpublic opinion.
Closer to our application, Liakataet al.
(2012) show that these methods can be ap-plied to analyse emotion in suicide notes.2.4 Research questionsHere, similar to (DeVault et al., 2013; Howes etal., 2013), our primary question is whether theseapproaches can be usefully applied to diagnoseconditions and predict outcomes, but in a newmodality ?
online text-based therapy ?
which mayrequire different and/or more robust methods.
Inaddition, we would like to gain some insight intowhich features of language and interaction mightbe predictive, in order to help clinicians improvetherapeutic methods, and to assess how generaland transferable any model might be.
Our mainquestions here are therefore:?
What features of text-based online therapy di-alogue might help predict symptoms and/oroutcomes?
Specifically, how predictive areconversation topic and emotional content??
Can we detect them accurately and reli-ably, using approaches generalisable to largedatasets, across different subjects and condi-tions??
Can the features provide any insights into thetreatment process and/or the online modality?3 Method3.1 DataThe data used in this study consisted of the tran-scripts from 882 Cognitive Behavioural Ther-apy (CBT) treatment dialogues between patientswith depression and/or anxiety and their ther-apists using an online text-based chat system.The transcripts are from online CBT providedby Psychology Online, who deliver ?live?
therapyfrom a qualified psychologist accessed via the in-ternet (http://www.psychologyonline.co.uk).
Of the 882 transcripts, 837 are betweentherapists and patients who were in an ongoingtreatment program or had completed their treat-ment by the time our sample was collected.
Thereare 167 patients in this sample (125 females and42 males), with 35 different therapists (for 2 pa-tients the identity of the therapist is unknown).The number of transcripts per patient ranges from1 to 14, with a mean of 5.011 (s.d.
2.73).
For allof the measures based on the transcripts, as out-lined below, we included all text typed by both thetherapist and the patient.
In addition to the tran-scripts themselves, each patient normally filled outtwo questionnaires prior to each session with theirtherapist.
These are described below.3.2 OutcomesPatient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) Thisis a self-administered diagnostic instrument forcommon mental disorders (Kroenke and Spitzer,2002).
The PHQ-9 is the depression module,which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as ?0?
(not at all) to ?3?
(nearly every day).
A higherscore indicates higher levels of depression, withscores ranging from 0-27.
It has been validatedfor use (Martin et al., 2006).Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7)Similarly, the GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006) is abrief self-report scale of generalised anxiety disor-der.
This is a 7-item scale which scores each of theitems as ?0?
(not at all) to ?3?
(nearly every day).A higher score indicates higher levels of anxiety.Outcome measures For the data in our sam-ple, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were highly correlated(r = 0.811, p < 0.001) so for the results re-ported below we focus on PHQ-9.
As each patientfilled in the PHQ-9 before each consultation, weused two different outcome measures: PHQ now?
the PHQ-9 score of the patient for the question-naire completed immediately prior to the consulta-tion; and PHQ start-now ?
the difference betweenthe PHQ-9 score prior to any treatment and PHQnow, i.e.
a measure of progress (how much bet-ter or worse the patient is since the start of theirtreatment).
Although these two measures are nu-merical, one of the general aims of our researchis to identify patients at risk.
We therefore bina-rised the outcome measures and treated our task9as a categorisation problem to identify the groupof interest.
For PHQ now, these were patients withmoderate to severe symptoms; for PHQ start-now,patients whose PHQ score had not improved.3.3 TopicsThe transcripts from the 882 treatment consulta-tions were analysed using an unsupervised proba-bilistic topic model, using MALLET (McCallum,2002) to apply standard Latent Dirichlet Alloca-tion (Blei et al., 2003), with the notion of docu-ment corresponding to a single consultation ses-sion, represented as the sequence of words typedby any speaker.
Stop words (common wordswhich do not contribute to the content, e.g.
?the?,?to?)
were removed as usual (Salton and McGill,1986), but the word list had to be augmented fortext chat conventions and spellings (e.g.
unpunc-tuated ?ive?).
Additionally, common mispellingswere mapped to their correctly spelled equivalentsusing Microsoft Excel?s in-built spellchecker.
Thiswas due to the nature of text chat, in contrast totranscribed speech or formal text ?
the word ?ques-tionnaire?, for example, was found to have beentyped in 21 different ways.
Following (Howes etal., 2013) we set the number of topics to 20,1usedthe default setting of 1000 Gibbs sampling itera-tions, and enabled automatic hyperparameter opti-misation to allow an uneven distribution of topicsvia an asymmetric prior over the document-topicdistributions (Wallach et al., 2009).As Howes et al.
(2013) did in face-to-face ther-apy, we found most topics were composed of co-herent word lists, with many corresponding tocommon themes in therapy e.g.
family (Topic 12),symptoms (16), treatment process (2, 14), and is-sues in work and social life (19, 5) ?
see Table 5.3.4 Sentiment and emotion analysisEach turn in the transcripts was then annotated forstrength of positive and negative sentiment, andlevel of anger.
We compared three approaches: thedictionary-based LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2007)and two machine learning approaches, the Stan-ford classifier based on deep neural nets and parsestructure trained on standard text (Socher et al.,2013), and one based on distant supervision oversocial media text, Sentimental (Purver and Bat-1An arbitrary decision, but Howes et al.
(2013) chose itto match the number defined by manual coders in a therapydomain.tersby, 2012).2None are specifically designed fortherapy dialogue data; however, given the unortho-dox spelling and vocabulary used in text chat, weexpect machine-learning based approaches, andtraining on ?noisy?
social media text, to providemore robustness.We used each to provide a posi-tive/negative/neutral sentiment value; for LIWC,we took this from the relative magnitudes of theposemo and negemo categories.
Two humanjudges then rated the 85 utterances in one tran-script independently.
Inter-annotator agreementwas good, with Cohen?s kappa = 0.66.
Agreementwith LIWC was poor (0.43-0.45); with Stanfordbetter (0.51-0.54); but best with Sentimental(0.63-0.80).
For anger, LIWC gave only oneutterance a non-zero rating, while Sentimentalprovided a range of values.
We therefore usedSentimental in our experiments.
Raw valuesper turn were scaled to [-1,+1] for sentiment(-1 representing strong negative sentiment, +1strong positive), and [0,1] for anger; we thenderived minimum, maximum, mean and standarddeviation values per transcript.3.5 Classification experimentsWe performed a series of experiments, to inves-tigate whether various features of the transcriptscould enable automatic detection of patient re-sponses to the PHQ-9.
The full range of possiblefeatures were calculated for each transcript ?
seeTable 1.
As well as topic, sentiment and emotionfeatures as detailed above, we include raw lexi-cal features to characterise details of content, andsome high-level features (amount of talk; patientdemographics; and therapist identity, known to af-fect outcomes).In each case, we used the Weka machine learn-ing toolkit (Hall et al., 2009) to pre-processdata, and a decision tree classifier (J48), a logis-tic regression model and the support vector ma-chine implementation LibLINEAR (Chang andLin, 2001) as classifiers.
PHQ now was bina-rised based on the classification in Kroenke andSpitzer (2002), whereby scores of 10 or over aremoderate to severe and scores of less than 10 aremild.
PHQ start-now was binarised according towhether there was an improvement (reduction) inthe PHQ score or not.
Positive scores indicate2Available from liwc.net, nlp.stanford.eduand sentimental.co respectively.10Feature set DescriptionAgentID Identity of the therapistHigh level Client gender; client age group; sessionnumber; client/agent number of words andturns used; proportion of all words per par-ticipantTopic Probability distribution of topics per tran-script (one value per topic per transcript)Sentiment Overall sentiment mean, standard devi-ation, minimum and maximum; overallanger mean, standard deviation, minimumand maximumWord Unigrams, for all words that appeared inat least 20 of the transcripts, regardless ofspeaker; the features were the normalisedcounts of each wordN-gram As word, but including unigrams, bigramsand trigramsTable 1: Feature sets for classification experimentsan improvement; scores of 0 or lower indicate nochange or a worsening of PHQ score.
Each out-come indicator was tested with different featuresets using 10-fold cross-validation.34 Results4.1 CorrelationsFirst, we examined statistical associations be-tween our four outcome measures and our avail-able features (see Section 3).
R-values are shownfor all significant correlations (at the p < 0.05level) in Tables 2-4.
For the PHQ now measure,a positive correlation means a greater value of thefeature is associated with a greater value of thePHQ score (i.e.
a higher level of symptoms).
Forthe PHQ start-now measures, a positive correla-tion means that a greater value of the feature is as-sociated with a greater improvement in the PHQscore since the start of treatment.
Correlationsgreater than ?0.2 are shown in bold.High-level With patients with a worse (higher)PHQ score (PHQ now), more words and turns aretyped by both participants.
Better overall progressscores are also weakly associated with the amountof talk, with fewer turns typed by both participantsif patients?
PHQ score has improved by a greater3We partition the data into 10 equal subsamples, and useeach subsample as the test data for a model trained on theremaining 90%.
This is repeated for each subsample (the 10folds), and the test predictions collated to give the overall re-sults.
This partitioning is done by transcript: different tran-scripts from the same patient may therefore appear in trainingand test data within the same fold; our use of low-dimensionaltopic/sentiment features should minimise over-fitting, but fu-ture work will investigate the extent of this effect.amount since the start of their treatment program(see Table 2).Sentiment As shown in Table 3, more negativesentiment expressed in the transcripts (mean andminimum), a higher variability of sentiment be-tween negative and positive (s.d.
), and greater lev-els of anger (mean and maximum) are associatedwith worse PHQ scores.
More positive sentiments(mean and maximum) are also associated with bet-ter progress.Topic Topics 2, 6, 9, 10, 16 and 17 are neg-atively correlated with PHQ scores, i.e.
higherlevels of these topics are associated with betterPHQ (see Table 4).
Some of these topics involvewords related to assessing the patient?s progressand feedback, e.g.
topic 2 includes session, goalsand questionnaires, and topic 17 includes good,work and positive.
Others relate to specific con-cerns of the patient, e.g.
topic 6 (worry, worryingand problem) and topic 16 (anxiety, fear and sick).The top twenty words assigned to each topic byLDA, and the direction of significant correlationsare shown in Table 5.Conversely, topics 4, 5, 7, 8, 11 and 18 arepositively correlated with PHQ scores, meaningmore talk assigned to these topics is associatedwith worse PHQ.
Several of these topics relate tospecific issues, such as topic 5 (sleep, bed, night)and topic 18 (eating, food, weight).
Some of thesetopics display overlap with the previous group(e.g.
topics 2 and 4 both contain words reviewingprogress such as session, week, next and last); thissuggests that some topics (e.g.
progress or particu-lar issues) are discussed in importantly (and recog-nisably) different ways or contexts (possibly dif-ferent emotional valences ?
see below), and thesedifferences are being identified by the automatictopic modelling.Similarly, greater amounts of talk in topics 2, 15and 17 are weakly associated with better progress.These are the topics identified above as involvingwords related to assessing progress, and feedback.Greater amounts of talk in topic 8 (checking, OCD,anxiety, rituals) is associated with worse progress.Cross-correlations between topic and senti-ment features Previous work has hypothesisedthat automatically derived topics may differ fromhand-coded topics in picking up additional factorsof the communication such as valence (Howes etal., 2013).
To explore this on a global level (i.e.11Measure PHQ now PHQ start-nowAgent number of words 0.231Client number of words 0.195Agent number of turns 0.149 -0.080Client number of turns 0.193 -0.071Table 2: Significant correlations of high-level features and outcomesMeasure PHQ now PHQ start-nowSentiment mean -0.237 0.119Sentiment s.d.

0.074Anger minimumAnger maximum 0.192Table 3: Significant correlations of sentiment features and outcomesat the level of the transcript, rather than at thefiner-grained level of the turn) we examined cross-correlations between sentiment and topic.
Thisinitial exploration offers support for this hypoth-esis, as can be seen in Table 6.
For example, top-ics 3 and 4 both contain words relating to feel-ings and thoughts, but topic 3 is positively corre-lated with sentiment, while topic 4 is negativelycorrelated.
These correlations indicate a complexrelationship between topic and sentiment whichshould be explored further in future research; ajoint topic-sentiment model might be appropriatee.g.
(Paul et al., 2013).
Although some topicspattern consistently with sentiment (e.g.
topic 12,with words about relatives and relationships, is as-sociated with negative sentiments and higher lev-els of anger) some do not (e.g.
topic 19 is asso-ciated with more positive sentiment, but greateranger).
Examination suggests that this topic in-volves discussions about feelings of anger, but notnecessarily expressing anger, and also may includetalk on how to deal with such feelings (with wordslike assertive).
These observations may indicatethat in this domain, in which people explicitly talkabout their feelings, fully accurate sentiment andemotion analysis may require a different approachthan in domains such as social media analysis.4.2 Classification experimentsResults of classification experiments on differentfeature sets are shown in Tables 7-9.
For each ex-periment, the weighted average f-score is shown,with the f-score for the class of interest shownin brackets.
For PHQ now the class of interestis patients with high (moderate to severe) PHQ-9scores; for PHQ start-now we are concerned withpatients who are not getting better.
As a baseline,the proportion of the data in the class of interest ineach case is shown in the first column in Table 7 ?note that these are not exactly 50%, but reflect theactual proportions in the data (see Section 3.5).High-level As can be seen in Table 7, if we usea feature set consisting of high-level features andAgentID, we are able to predict PHQ now andPHQ start-now reasonably well (> 0.7).
How-ever, given the nature of the data, it is uncommonfor a therapist to have many clients of the sameage group and gender; these features can thereforeact as a reasonable proxy for identifying individ-ual patients, meaning that this result is somewhatspurious.
Also, although identity of therapist is animportant factor in therapeutic outcomes (McCabeet al., 2013a; McCabe et al., 2013b), we wouldlike to identify aspects of the communication thatexplain why particular therapists are more success-ful than others, and generalise our findings to newtherapists.
AgentID was therefore removed in allsubsequent experiments.Sentiment and topic As shown in Table 8, us-ing the proportions of derived topics by transcriptas features does allow us to predict whether a pa-tient has a high PHQ now score reasonably well;but sentiment alone performs poorly.
Combiningsentiment and topic features, however, allows usto predict PHQ now with scores of around 0.7 (i.e.approaching the accuracy achieved using high-level and AgentID features above).
Prediction ofthe progress measure is less effective.Words and n-grams For the symptom mea-sure, using words and n-grams gives f-scores in12Measure PHQ now PHQ start-nowTopic 2 -0.157 0.112Topic 4 0.124Topic 5 0.176Topic 6 -0.117Topic 7 0.217Topic 8 0.093 -0.126Topic 9 -0.077Topic 10 -0.149Topic 11 0.140Topic 12 0.080Topic 15 0.072Topic 16 -0.112Topic 17 -0.211 0.079Topic 18 0.121Table 4: Significant correlations of topic features and outcomesTopic PHQ+/-Sentiment+/-Anger+/-keywordsTopic 0 - + good thought re well also mindfulness hw thoughts now vc maybe prob message neg just wk one self bitTopic 1 people good others self evidence thought enough wrong negative esteem thinking say confidence beliefs person true someone belief situationTopic 2 - + - session send goals next week last sent read great think questionnaires also homework goal appointment set time cbt ableTopic 3 + thoughts thinking unhelpful helpful look thought behaviours go feelings may think anxiety negative try aware behaviour agenda start selfTopic 4 + - feel think like just good really week now know last session next say felt people thoughts going feeling bitTopic 5 + - + sleep bed day week work get night mood time diary see better much sleeping activity house routine done activitiesTopic 6 - worry worrying worries bit stop train worried problem go example idea control hierarchy driving exposure home happen worst carTopic 7 + - help feel gp depression thank understand therapy now feeling life today think problems able little message medication sorry makeTopic 8 + check checking ocd thoughts anxiety try something difficult danger brain week sense threat helpful away rituals anxious elephant imagesTopic 9 - - think time like much way sure see though know look lot sounds well also right thing sorry sense differentTopic 10 - + thought thoughts anxiety really situation situations one week next example social experience record great emotions thanks notice see makeTopic 11 + + things get time go need like want now just something feel know one work good day going give nextTopic 12 + - + mum relationship husband life family dad parents never love feelings children said years mother much hard way told sisterTopic 13 really week think appointment homework however lets teeth questions great just ready start may dentist set end sure therapyTopic 14 + - great right sure appointment just thank well tonight loo lol good say really cool get going sorry transcript absolutelyTopic 15 + - things like get bit good sounds feeling also something really great today think idea send week useful anything makeTopic 16 - - anxiety panic breathing get anxious feeling going go attack fear physical control try happen sick symptoms times cope distractionTopic 17 - + - good work well positive back help really time still last much weeks use thanks session better keep done thingsTopic 18 + eating eat food weight day week meal lunch dinner pie energy good mum put table public walk believe ateTopic 19 + + work job anger angry school stress thanks wife team stuff issues also boss year assertiveness assertive meeting kids timesTable 5: Top 20 words per topicline with those using only the reduced dimen-sionality of sentiment and topic.
This is surpris-ing; one might expect finer-grained lexical fea-tures (which provide more information via a muchhigher-dimensional feature space) to increase pre-dictivity, as per Howes et al.
(2013); on the otherhand, it is also promising as it suggests that mean-ingful generalisations can be drawn out of this datausing NLP techniques.For the progress measure, on the other hand, n-gram features perform better than topic/sentiment(though not as well as on the symptom measures);this suggests that there are aspects of the com-munication that can assist in predicting patientprogress, but that they are not captured by the topicand sentiment information as currently defined.This suggests that dialogue structure or style mayplay a role; one possibility for exploration is tolook at topic and/or sentiment at a finer-grainedlevel and examine their dynamics (e.g.
are posi-tive sentiments expressed near the start or end of aconsultation linked to better progress)?5 DiscussionStandard topic, sentiment and emotion modellingcan be usefully applied to online text therapy dia-logue, although care is needed choosing and ap-plying a technique suitable for the idiosyncraticlanguage and spelling.
The resulting informationallows us to predict aspects of symptom sever-ity and patient progress with reasonable degreesof accuracy (similar to those achieved with face-to-face data (DeVault et al., 2013; Howes et al.,2012)), without requiring knowledge of thera-pist identity.
