NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT NOW:IDENTIFYING CUE PHRASES INTONATIONALLYJulia HirschbergAT&T Bell LaboratoriesMurray Hill, New Jersey 07974Diane LitmanAT&T Bell LaboratoriesMurray Hill, New Jersey 07974ABSTRACTCue phrases are words and phrases such as now and by theway which may be used to convey explicit informationabout the structure of a discourse.
However, while cuephrases may convey discourse structure, each may also beused to different effect.
The question of how speakersand hearers distinguish between such uses of cue phraseshas not been addressed in discourse studies to date.
Basedon a study of now in natural recorded discourse, we pro-pose that cue and non-cue usage can be distinguished into-nationally, on the basis of phrasing and accent.I.
IntroductionCue phrases are linguistic expressions -- such as okay, but,now, anyway, by the way, in any case, that reminds me --which may, instead of making a 'semantic' ontribution toan utterance (i.e., affecting its truth conditions), be usedto convey explicit information about the structure of adiscourse \[4\], \[16\], \[5\].
1 For example, anyway can indi-cate a topic return and that reminds me can signal a digres-sion.
The recognition and generation of cue phrases is ofconsiderable interest o research in natural language pro-cessing.
The structural information conveyed by thesephrases is crucial to tasks such as anaphora resolution \[6\],\[5\], \[16\] and the identification of rhetorical relationsamong portions of a text or discourse \[11\], \[8\], \[16\].
Ithas also been claimed that the incorporation of cue phrasesinto natural language processing systems helps reduce thecomplexity of discourse processing \[21\], \[4\], \[10\].Despite the recognized importance of cue phrases, manyquestions about how they are defined both individuallyand as a class -- and how they are to be represented, gen-erated, and recognized -- remain to be examined.
Forexample, in the general case, each lexical item that canserve as a 'cue phrase' also has an alternate interpreta-tion.
2 While the 'cue' interpretation provides explicit1.
Previous literature has employed the terms 'clue word', 'discoursemarker' or 'discourse particle' for these items \[16\], \[4\], \[14\], \[18\].More recently Grosz and Sidner \[5\] have proposed the term cuephrase for these items, which we will adopt in this paper.2.
If 'non-lexical' items such as uh are classed as cue phrases, thenthis generalization may not hold for all cue phrases.
However,information about the structure of a discourse, the 'non-cue' interpretation provides quite different information,such as conjunction (but) or adverbial modification (any-way).
Distinguishing between these two uses is critical tothe interpretation of discourse.
In this paper, we addressthe problem of how this distinction might be made: Wepropose that, in speech, this distinction is made intona-tionally.
We support our hypothesis by an analysis of cueand non-cue uses of the item now in recorded naturallyoccurring discourse.In Section 2 we discuss the general problem of distinguish-ing between cue and non-cue usage and consider possiblealternatives to our hypothesis.
In Section 3 we presentrelevant aspects of the theory of English intonationassumed here for our analysis \[13\], \[9\].
Section 4describes our data, presents the results of our analysis,and along with Section 5, discusses the implications of ourresults for the identification of cue phrases in general --both in speech and in written text.2.
The ProblemPrevious definitions of cue phrases as a class have beenextensional and definitions of particular cue phrases pro-cedural.
For example, now signals a 'push' or 'pop' \[5\] ofthe attentional stack or 'further development' of a previ-ous context \[16\].
Despite some recognition \[5\] that cuephrases are not always employed as cue phrases, noattempt has been made to discover how 'cue' uses of cuephrases are distinguished from 'non-cue' uses.
When doesnow, for example, function as a discourse marker andwhen is it deictic?Roughly, the non-cue or deictic use of now makes refer-?nce to a span of time which minimally includes the utter-ance time.
This time span may include little more thanmoment of utterance, as in I, or it may be of indeter-minate length, as in 2.
3even uh appears to have both 'cue' and 'non-cue' uses; i.e., it maysignal a digression or interruption, or it may simply serve as apause filler.3.
These and other examples are taken from a radio call-in program,Harry Gross's "Speaking of Your Money" \[15\].
The corpus will bedescribed in more detail in Section 4.1631.Fred: Yeah I think we'll look that up and possiblyuh after one of your breaks Harry.Harry: OK we'll take one now.
Just hang on Billand we'll be right back with you.oHarry: You know I see more coupons now than I'veever seen before and I'll bet you have too,In contrast, the cue use of now signals a return to a previ-ous topic, as in the two examples of now in 3, or intro-duces a subtopic, as in 4..Harry:Fred whatta you have to say about this IRAproblem?Fred: Ok. You see now unfortunately Harry aswe alluded to earlier when there is adistribution from an IRA that is taxable...{discussion of caller's beneficiary status}...Now the the five thousand that you'realluding to uh of the --4.Doris: I have a couple quick questions about theincome tax.
The first one is my husband isretired and on social security and in '81 hefew odd jobs for a friend uh around theproperty and uh he was reimbursed for thatto the tune of about $640.
Now wherewould he where would we put that on theform?While the distinction between cue and non-cue now seemsfairly clear in the above examples, other cases are moredifficult.
Consider 5:5,Ethel: All right I have just retired from a positionthat I've been in for forty some odd years.
Ihave -- I earned in 1981 about thirtythousand dollars.
Now I have a profitsharing coming to me.
My  problem is shall Itake the ten year averaging...From the transcription alone, either a cue or a non-cueinterpretation is plausible.
The caller might have a profitsharing due her at the moment of utterance (non-cue).Or, she might be using now to mark profit sharing as asubtopic (cue) -- leaving the time of the profit sharingunspecified.How then do hearers distinguish cue from non-cue uses?One might propose that hearers use tense to delimit casesin which deictic now is vossible.
That is, it would seemreasonable to propose that deictic now occurs only whenthe verb modified by now (or the main verb of the clauseso modified) is temporally compatible -- i.e., non.past.For example, using the past tense in 1 -- we took one now-- seems distinctly odd.
However, we took one just now isclearly felicitous.
So, both cue and non-cue now are possi-ble when the main verb is in the past tense.
As examples1- 3 above illustrate, both are also possible when the mainverb is in the present tense.
So, tense is clearly inade-quate to distinguish between cue and non-cue uses of now.Another possible diagnostic for non-cue now might besome notion of the general felicity of temporal referencein an utterance -- which might correspond to the felicity ofsubstituting other temporal adverbials for now.
For exam-ple, we'll take one in an hour would be felicitous in 1, aswould I see more coupons these days in 2.
Substitutingother temporals for now in either example 3 (Today the thefive thousand that you're alluding to...) or example 4 (Mon-day where would he where would we put that on the form?
)would be infelicitous.
However, this is only a necessary --but hot a sufficient -- test for deictic now.
While a tem-poral adverbial may be substituted for now in 5 (e.g.,Today I have a profit sharing coming to me), both cue andnon-cue interpretations appear equaliy plausible from thetranscription, as noted above.
In fact, listeners have nohesitation in labeling this a cue now.A third possibility is that hearers use surface order posi-tion to distinguish cue from non-cue uses.
In fact, mostsystems that generate cue phrases assume a canonical (usu-ally first) position within the clause \[16\], \[21\].
However,without intonational information, surface position mayitself be unclear.
Consider Example 6:,Evelyn: I see.
So in other words I will have to paythe full amount of the uh of the tax nowwhat about Pennsylvania state tax?
Can yougive me any information on that?Although a cue reading is possible, most readers wouldassign now a non-cue interpretation if it is associated withthe preceding clause, I will have to pay the full amount ofthe...tax now -- but a cue interpretation if it is associatedwith the succeeding clause, Now what about Pennsylvaniastate tax?.
The actual recording of 6 clearly supports thelatter interpretation: the strong intonational boundarybetween tax and now identifies the clausal boundary --and, thus, indirectly, the surface position of now within itsclause.
Similarly, 7 would be ambiguous between a cuereading, Well now, you've got another point, and a deicticreading, Well, now you've got another point -- without into-national cues:1647,Fred: You stand up for your rights.
Whatever yougive to charity you claim.Linda:(laughs) I don't want the hassle of an of anFred: Well now you've got another point and Ithink at at times the service counts on thefact that people don't want the hassle --and maybe we as Americans have to standup a little bit more and claim what's due us.Here it is clear from the recording that Fred intended thedeictic use.
Later, we will present evidence from ourcorpus that cue now can appear clause-finally, and non-cuenow, clause.initially.
So, surface position also appearsinadequate to distinguish cue from non-cue now.Finally, hearers might use syntactic information todiscriminate between cue and non-cue usage.
At least fornow, this seems unlikely.
Both cue and non-cue now's arecommonly classed as adverbials.
So syntactic categorydoes not differentiate.
Furthermore, both can be attachedat the sentence level.
While non-cue now may also modifyVP, it is difficult to imagine attaching cue now at thatlevel -- since, by definition, it can make no 'semantic' on-tribution to either S or riP.
However, this potentialattachment distinction does not provide a means of distin-guishing cue from non-cue now -- rather, attachment possi-bilities must be based on the prior cue/ non-cue distinc-tion.
So, syntactic structure provides no useful clues tothe identification of cue versus non-cue usage in this case.In summary, neither tense, nor the 'appropriateness' oftemporal modification (or lack thereof), nor surface posi-tion, nor syntactic structure provides adequate informationfor distinguishing between cue and non-cue now.
As  we.will show in the remainder of this paper, however, intona-tional features do provide such information.3.
Phrasing and Accent In EnglishThe importance of intonational information to the com-munication of discourse structure has been recognized in avariety of studies \[7\], \[20\], \[2\], \[17\], \[1\].
However, justwhich intonational features are important and how theycommunicate discourse information is not well understood.Under-utilization of objective measures of intonationalfeatures in empirical research and the lack of a sufficientlyexplicit system for intonational description have made itdifficult to compare and evaluate specific claims.
For ourstudy we have examined fundamental frequency (F0) con-tours produced using an autocorrelation pitch trackerdeveloped by Mark Liberman.
As a system of intona--tional description, we have adopted Pierrehumbert's \[13\]theory of English intonation.In Pierrehumbert's ystem, intonational contours aredescribed as sequences of low (L) and high (H) tones inthe F0 (fundamental frequency) contour.
A well-formedintermediate phrase consists of one or more pitch accents,which are aligned with stressed syllables (with alignmentindicated by *) on the basis of the metrical pattern of thetext and signify intonational prominence, and a simplehigh (H) or low (L) tone that represents the phraseaccent.?
The phrase accent controls the pitch between thelast pitch accent of the current intermediate phrase and thebeginning of the next -- or the end of the utterance.
Into-national phrases are larger phonological units, composedof one of more intermediate phrases.
At the end of anintonational phrase, a boundary tone, which may also beIt  or L and is indicated by '%' ,  falls exactly at the phraseboundary.
So, each intonational phrase ends with aphrase accent and a boundary tone.A phrase's tune, or melody, has as its domain the intona-tional phrase.
It is defined by the sequence of pitchaccent(s), phrase accent(s), and boundary tone of thatphrase.
For example, an ordinary declarative pattern witha final fall is represented as H* L L% -- that is, a tunewith H* pitch accent(s), a L phrase accent, and a L%boundary tone.
Consider the pitch track in Figure 1representing a simple intonational phrase composed of oneintermediate phrase and with a typical declarative contour.
(For ease of comparison of intonational features here, wepresent pitch contours of synthetic speech, produced withthe Bell Labs Text-to-Speech System \[12\].
The analysiswe will present in Section 4 is based upon recorded naturalspeech.

A Simple Declarative ContourAll the pitch accents in this phrase, including the nuclearaccent -- the primary stressed syllable -- are high (H*).The phrase accent is L and the boundary tone is also low(L%).A given sentence may be uttered with considerable varia-tion in phrasing.
For example, in Figure 1 Now let's talkabout 'now' was produced as a single intonational phrase,whereas in Figure 2 Now is set off as a separate phrase.1651.

Two PhrasesThe occurrence of phrase accents and boundary tones,together with other phrase-final characteristics such aspauses and syllable lengthening, enable us to identifyintermediate and intonational phrases in natural as well asin synthetic speech.Pitch accents, peaks or valleys in the F0 contour whichfall on the stressed syllables of lexical items, make thoseitems intonationally prominent.
In Figure 3, the firstinstance of now has no pitch accent, while the secondreceives nuclear stress.
(In our notation, the absence of aspecified accent indicates that a word is not accented.

Deaccenting 'Now'Contrast Figure 3 with Figure 1.
In Figure 3, the first f0peak occurs on let's; in Figure 1, the first peak occurredon now.A pitch accent consists either of a single tone or anordered pair of tones, such as L*+H.
The tone alignedwith the stressed syllable is indicated by a star (*); thus, inan L*+H accent, the low tone (L*) is aligned with thestressed syllable.
There are six pitch accants in English:two simple tones -- H and L -- and four complex ones --L*+H, L+H*, H*+L, and H+L*.
The most commonaccent, H*, comes out as a peak on the accanted syllable(as, on Now in Figure 1).
L* accants occur much lower inthe pitch range than H* and are phonetically realized aslocal f0 minima.

An L+H* AccentNote that there is a peak on now (H*) -- as there was inFigure 1 -- but now a striking valley (L) occurs just beforethis peak.While other intonational features, such as overall tune orp i tch  range, 4 may also provide information about cuephrase interpretation, so far we have found the most signi-ficant results by comparing accent and phrasing for cueand non-cue now.1664.
Intonational Characteristics of Cue and Non-Cue NowTo investigate our hypothesis that cue and non-cue uses ofLinguistic expressions can be distinguished intonationally,we conducted a study of the cue phrase now in recordednatural speech.
Our corpus consisted of recordings of fourdays of "The Harry Gross Show: Speaking of YourMoney", recorded during the week of I February 1982\[1S\].
In this Philadelphia radio call-in program, Grossoffers financial advice to callers; for the 3 February show,he was joined by an accountant friend, Fred Levy.
Thefour shows provided approximately ten hours of conversa-tion between expert(s) and callers.We chose now to begin our study of cue phrases forseveral reasons.
First, our corpus contained numerousinstances of both cue and non-cue now (approximately 350in all).
In contrast, phrases such as anyway,  anyhow,therefore, moreover,  and fur thermore appear fewer than tentimes each.
A second reason for our choice of now is thatnow often appears in conjunction with other cue phrases(as with well  in 7, or I see now,  now another thing, ok now,right now.)
This allows us to study how adjacent cuephrases interact with one another.
Third, now has anumber of desirable phonetic characteristics.
As it ismonosyllabic, possible variation in stress patterns do notarise to complicate the analysis.
Because it is completelyvoiced and introduces no segmental effects into the f0 con-tour, it is also easier to analyze pitch tracks reliably.4.1 Sample OneOur first sample consisted of 48 occurrences of now -- allthe instances from two sides of tapes of the show chosenat random.
5 The 48 tokens were produced by fifteen dif-ferent speakers; 22.9% were produced by Harry Grossand 77.1% by other speakers.We analyzed this data in the following way: First, threepeople (including the authors) determined by ear whetherindividual tokens were cue or non-cue.
We then digitizedand pitch-tracked the intonational phrase containing eachtoken, plus (where same speaker) the preceding andsucceeding intonational phrases.
For this study we com-pared cue and non-cue uses along several dimensions: 1)We examined whether each instance of now was accentedand, if so, noted the type of accent employed.
2) Weidentified differences in phrasing, including in particularwhether or not now represented an entire intermediate orintonational phrase.
3) We noted where now occurredpositionally in its intonational and its intermediate phrase,4.
The pitch range of an intonational phrase is deemed by its topline- roughly, the highest peak in the f0 contour of the phrase - andthe speaker's baseline - the lowest point the speaker ealizes innormal speech, measured across all utterances.
Since the baselineis rarely realized in an utterance, pitch ranges may be comparedfor a given speaker by comparing toplines.5.
Two instances were excluded from this sample since the phrasingwas unavailable due to hesitation or interruption.whether first, not first but preceded only by other cuephrases, last, or none of these.
4) We looked at the typeof intonational contour used over the phrase in which nowoccurred.
5) We noted when now occurred with (linearlyadjacent o) other cue phrases.
6) We identified the posi-tion of the phrase containing now with respect to speakerturn.
Of  these, (1-3) turned out to distinguish betweencue and non-cue now quite reliably.
That is, accent typeand phrasing distinguished between all 48 of the tokens inthe sample.Just over one-third of our sample (17) were determined tobe non-cue and just under two-thirds (31) cue.
The firststriking difference between the two appeared in phrasing,as illustrated in Table I: Of all the non-cue uses of now,none appeared as the only item in an intonational or inter-mediate phrase, while fully 42.0% of cue now representedentire intonational or intermediate phrases.
(Of these 13cue now's, 8 were t~c only lexical item in a full intona-tional phrase.)
A X test of association between cue/non-cu~ status and phrasing shows significance at the .005 level(X~(I)--9.8).
6 So, this sample suggests that now's whichINPHRASE WHOLEPHRASENON-CUE 17 0CUE 18 13Table 1.
Phrasing for Cue and Non-Cue Noware set apart as separate intermediate or intonationalphrases are very likely to be cue news.Another clear distinction between cue and non-cue now'sin this sample emerged when we examined the position ofnow within its intermediate phrase.
As Table 2 illustrates,all 31 cue now's  were 'first' (30 were absolutely first andFIRST LAST  OTHERNON-CUE 3 I0 4CUE 31 0 0Table 2.
Position within Intermediate Phrase6.
The ?2 test measures the degree of association between two vari-ables by calculating the probability (.p) that the disparity betweenexpected and actual values in each cell is due to chance.
The valueof X 2 itself for (n) degrees of freedom (d.f.)
is an overall measureof this disparity.
The data show in Table 1 have ?2 = 9.8 for 1d.f., p < .005.
That is, there is less than a .5% probability thatthis apparent association is due to chance.
Roughly.
p < .01 orbetter isgenerally accepted as indicating 'statistical significance'; p> .01 becomes more controversial; p > .05 is generally considerednot statistically significant; and p > .2 is good indication of a lackof discernible association between two variables.
So, the data inTable 1, which are significant at the .001 level, appear very reli-ably associated.167one followed another cue phrase) in their phrase.
Not onlywere these first in intermediate phrase -- they were alsofirst in their (larger) intonational phrase.
Only threenon-cue now's  occupied a similar position (again, with onefollowing a cue phrase).
However, I0 non-cue now's(58.8%) were last in their intermediate phrase -- and halfof these were last in their intonational phrase.
Again, thedata show a very strong association (?
"(2)=36.0, p <.001).
So, once intonational phrasing is determined, cueand non-cue now are generally distinguishable by positionwithin the phrase, with cue now's  tending to come first inintonational phrase and non-cue now's  last (at least inintermediate phrase and often in intonational phrase aswell).Finally, cue and non-cue occurrences in this sample weredistinguishable in terms of presence or absence of pitchaccent -- and by type of pitch accent, where accented.Because of the large number of possible accent ypes, andsince there are competing reasons to accent or deaccentitems, ./ we might expect these findings to be less clearthan those for phrasing.
In fact, although their interpreta-tion is more complicated, the results are equally striking.The overzll results of the 46 occurrences from this samplefor which accent ype could be precisely determined 8 arepresented in Table 3:DEACCENTED H*orCOMPLEX L*NON-CUE 2 15 0CUE 13 10 6Table 3.
Accenting of Cue and Non-Cue NowNote first that large numbers of cue and non-cue tokenswere uttered with a H* or complex accent (34.5% of cueand fully 88.2% of non-cue), The chief similarity herelies in the use of the H* accent ype, with 9 cue uses and8 non-cue (and 2 other non-cue tokens are either H* orcomplex).
Note also that cue now's  were much morelikely overall to be deaccented (44.8% vs. 13.3%).
Nonon-cue now was uttered with a L* accent -- although 6cue now's  were.An even sharper distinction in accent ype is found if weseparate out those now's  which form entire intermediate orintonational phrases from the analysis.
(Recall that thesetokens are all cue uses.
These now's  were alwaysaccented, since each such phrase must contain at least onepitch accent.)
Of the 11 cue phrases representing entirephrases (and for which we can distinguish accent ype pre-cisely), 9 bore H* accents.
This suggests that one similar-ity between cue and non-cue now .- the frequent H* accent7.
Such as, accenting to indicate contrastive stress or dcaccenting toindicate an item is already salient in the discourse.8.
2 cue now's were either L* or H* with a compressed pitch range-- might disappear if we limit our comparison to thosenow's  forming part of larger intonational phrases.
In fact,such is the ease, as illustrated in Table 4:DEACCENTED H*orCOMPLEX L*NON-CUE 2 15 0CUE 13 0 5Table 4.
Accenting of Now's  in Larger Intonational PhrasesA  a i n ,  these results arc significant at the .001 level, (2)=28.1.
The great majority (88.2%) of non-cue now'sforming part of larger intonational phrases received a H*or complex pitch accent, while the majority (72.2%) ofcue now's  forming part of larger intonational phrases weredeaccented.
Since all other cue now's  forming part oflarger intonational phrases received a L* accent, only twonow's  forming part of larger intonational phrases are notdistinguishable in terms of accent type -- the two deac-cented non-cue now's.
So, those cue now's not distinguish-able from non-cue by being set apart as separate intona-tional phrases were generally so distinguishable in terms ofaccenting.
Since neither of the deaccented non-cue now'sappeared at the beginning of an intonational phrase -- asall cue now's  did -- all of the instances of now in our sam-ple were in fact distinguishable ascue or non-cue in termsof their position in phrase, phrasal compostion, andaccent.We also examined whether cue and non-cue now patterneddifferently in terms of appearance with other cue phrases,with the following results:ALONE WITHCUENON-CUE 9 8CUE 22 9Table 5.
Occurrence with Other Cue PhrasesSomewhat counter-intuitively, non-cue now tended toappear more frequently than cue now with other cuephrases -- although generally these other cue phrases werealso used in their non-cue sense, e.g., right now.
Theco~ecurrence is not, however, statistically significant(?
(1)=1.6, p > .2), At any rate, the possibility thatlisteners identify cue now by its co-occurrence with othercue phrases receives no support from our data.
Examina-tion of the intonational contour used with phrases contain-ing cue and non-cue now, and of the location of thesephrases within speaker turn also produced no significantresults.So, we were able to hypothesize from this sample that cueand non-cue now are characterizable in the following ways:168Non-cue now forms part of larger intonational phrases andtends to be accented and to receive a It* or complex pitchaccent.
All non,cue uses in the sample did form part oflarger intonational phrases and all but two .- which weredeaccented -- were accented with a It* or complex accent.Cue now seems to form two classes: One class is generallyset apart as a separate intermediate or intonational phrase.Something under half of our sample fell into this category.The other class, which constituted just over half of oursample, forms part of a larger intonational phrase and iseither deaccented or uttered with a L* accent.
Bothclasses share the property of appearing in initial intona-tional phrase position.In summary, non-cue now is always distinct from cue nowin our sample in terms of a combination of accent type,position in intonational phrase, and overall composition ofthe intermediate or intonational phrase.
Thus wehypothesize that hearers might be able to distinguishbetween the two uses of now in three'ways: by notingwhether now formed a separate intermediate (orintonational) phrase, by locating now positionally withinits intonational phrase, and by identifying the presence orabsence of a pitch accent on now and the type of suchaccent where present.
To test the validity of thesehypotheses, we replicated our study with a second samplefrom the same corpus.4.2 Sample TwoFor our second sample, we examined the first 52 instancesof now taken from another four randomly chosen sides oftapes.
9 This sample included tokens from fifteen speak-ers, with exactly half produced by the host and half byothers.
I0 This time, six people (including the authors)determined whether instances were cue or non-cue beforewe analyzed the intonational features.
We next examinedphrasing and accent used with these tokens to test thehypotheses derived from our first sample.Again, just over one third of our sample (20) were deter-mined to be non-cue and just under two-thirds (32) cue.The striking differences in phrasing noted between cue andnon-cue now in sample one were again present in sampletwo: Again, around 40% (13) of cue now's formedseparate intermediate (8) or intonational (5) phrases; onlyone of the 20 non-cue now's formed a separate intermedi-ate phrase and none a separate intonational phrase.
Theseresults were significant at the .005 level -- again strongevidence of association between cue/non-cue status andphrasal composition.
When we tested position of nowwithin its intonational phrase in sample two, we againfound that cue now generally began the intonationalphrase: All but one cue now (this ended its phrase) began9.
We excluded 2 tokens from these tapes because of lack of availableinformation about phrasing or accent and 5 others because ourinformants were unable to decide whether the now was cue ornon-cue.10.We speak to this issue below.its phrase; again, most (60%) non-cue now's came last inphrase, with two first.
These results were significant atthe .001 level.Finally, our hypotheses about accent ype were also borneout by our second study: The division of all cue and non-cue now's by accent ype appears even more pronounced inthe second study: Of 20 non-cue now's,  85% of non-cuewere H* or complex and the rest deaccented; while of 31cue now's,  58.1% were deaccented, 19.4% H* or complex,and 22.6% L*.
So, while non-cue now's are almost identi-cal to those in the first sample, cue now's are more dis-tinguished here from non-cue.
When instances of nowforming entire intermediate or intonational phrases areremoved.from the second sample, the accenting of cue andnon-cue now is even more distinct: All cue now's formingpart of a larger phrase are deaccented, while only 15.8%of non-cue now are; the rest of the non-cue now's receivea H* or complex accent (p < .001).
So, our second sam-ple confirmed our hypotheses that cue and non-cue nowcan be differentiated intonationally in terms of positionwithin intonational phrase, composition of intermediate orintonational phrase, and choice of accent.4.3 Speaker IndependenceAlthough our second sample did confirm our initialhypotheses, the preponderance of tokens in both samplesfrom one (professional) speaker might well be of concern.To test this, we compared characteristics of phrasing andaccent for host and non-host data over the combined sam-ples (n=lO0).
The results showed no significant differ-ences between host and caller tokens in terms of thehypotheses proposed from our first sample and confirmedby our second: First, host (n=37) and callers (n=63) pro-duced cue and non-cue tokens in roughly similar propor-tions -- 40.5% non-cue for the host and 34.9% for his call-ers (p > .5).
Similarly, there was no distinction betweenhost and non-host data in terms of choice of accent ype,or accenting vs. deaccenting (p > .I).
Our hypothesisabout the significance of position within intonationalphrase holds for both host and non-host data with signifi-cance at the .001 level in each case.
However, in ten-dency to set cue now apart as a separate intonational orintermediate phrase, there was an interesting distinctionbetween host and caller: While callers tended to choosefrom among the two options for cue now in almost equalnumbers (48.8% of their cue now's are separate phrases),the host chose this option only 27.3% of the time.
Whileanalysis of data for callers and for all speakers hows thatthe relationship between cue use and separate phrase issignificant at the .001 level, this relationship is notsignificant for the host data.
However, although ost andcaller data differ in the proportion of occurrences of thetwo classes of cue now which emerge from our data as awhole, the existence of the classes themselves are con-firmed.
Where the host did not produce cue now's setapart as separate intonational or intermediate phrases, healways produced cue now's which were deaccented oraccented with a L* accent.
So, while individual speakers169may choose different strategies to realize cue now, theyappear to choose from among the same limited number ofoptions.
In sum, the hypotheses proposed on the basis ofour first sample are borne out by our analysis of thesecond -- and remain significant even when we eliminatethe host from our sample.4.4 Distinguishing Cue and Non-Cue Usage in TextOur conclusion from this study that intonational featuresplay a crucial role in the distinction between cue and non-cue usage in speech clearly poses problems for text.
Doreaders use strategies different from hearers to make thisdistinction, and, ff so, what might they be?
Are thereperhaps orthographic correlates of the intonational featureswhich we have found to be important in speech?
As afirst step toward resolving these questions, we examinedthe orthographic features of the transcripts of our corpus(which were prepared without particular consideration ofintonational features) and made a preliminary examinationof two sets of typescript interactions.We examined transcriptions of all tokens of now in bothour samples to determine whether phrasing was indicatedorthographicaUy.
II Of all those instances of now (n--60)that were absolutely first in their intonational phrase,56.7% (34) were preceded by punctuation -- a comma,dash, or end punctuation.
28.3% (17) were first inspeaker turn, and thus othographicaUy 'marked' by indica-tion of speaker name.
It should be noted that these unitsso distinguished were not necessarily syntactically well-formed units.
So, in 85% (51) of cases, first position inintonational phrase was marked in the transcription ortho-graphically.
No now's that were not absolutely first in.their intonational phrase (in particular, none that weremerely first in intermediate phrase) were so marked.
Ofthose 23 now's coming last in an intermediate or intona-tional phrase, however, only 60.9% (14) are immediatelyfollowed by a similar orthographic clue.
Finally, of the 13instances of now which formed separate intonationalphrases, only 2 were so marked orthographically -- bybeing both preceded and followed by some punctuation.None of the now's forming only complete intermediatephrases were so marked.These findings suggest hat only the intonational feature'first in intonational phrase' has any clear orthographiccorrelate.
However, since this feature does characterize90.1% of the 63 cue now's in our spoken data (mergingboth samples) -- and since 85.0% of these cue now's arealso orthographically marked for position as well (so that80.1% of cue now's can be orthographically distinguished)-- it seems that this correlation between intonation andorthography may be a useful one to pursue.
It is also pos-sible that a perusal of text, rather than transcribed speech,might indicate more orthographic lues to cue/non-cuedisambiguation.
We are currently examining two sets of11.No instances of capitalization or other othographic marking ofnuclear stress appear in any of the transcripts.typescripts 12 of task-oriented text interactions.5.
ConclusionsOur study of the cue phrase now strongly suggests thatspeakers and hearers can distinguish between cue andnon-cue uses of cue phrases intonationaUy, by making ornoting differences in accent and phrasing.
Cue and non-cue now in our samples are reliably distinguished in termsof whether now forms a separate intermediate or intona-tional phrase, whether it occurs first in its intonationalphrase, and whether it is accented or not -- and, ifaccented, the type of accent it bears.
In the absence ofakernate known means of distinction between cue andnon-cue use, we propose that speakers and hearers do dif-ferentiate intonationally.
Our next step is to extend ourstudy to other cue phrases, including anywm), well, f irst,and right.
We also plan to examine the relationshipbetween cue usage and pitch range manipulation \[7\],another indicator of discourse structure.
The goal of ourresearch is both to provide new sources of linguistic infor-mation for work in plan inference and discourse under-standing, and to permit more sophisticated use of intona-tional variation in synthetic speech.AcknowledgementsThanks to Janet Pierrchumbert and Jan van Santen forhelp in data analysis, to Don Hindle, Mats Rooth, andKim Silverman for providing judgements, and to DavidEtherington, Osamu Fujimura, Brad Goodman, KathyMcCoy, Martha Pollack, and the ACL reviewers for theirhelpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.12.
