TEMPORAL RELATIONS IN TEXTS AND TIME LOGICAL INFERENCESJ0rgen KunzeCentral  Inst itute of L inguist icsAcademy of Sciences of GDRDDR-1100 Berl inAbstract: A calculus is presented whichal lows an ef f ic ient  treatment of the fol low-ing components: Tenses, temporal conjunc-tions, temporal adverbials (of "definite"type), temporal  quant i f icat ions and phases.The phases are a means for structur ing theset of t ime-points t where a certain propo-sit ion is valid.
For one proposit ion theremay exist several "phase"-perspect ives.
Thecalculus has integrat ive propert ies,  i. e.all f ive components are represented by thesame formal means.
This renders possible arather easy combinat ion of all informationsand condit ions coming from the aforesaidcomponents.I.
Prerequis i tsWe assume that proposi t ions are replaced byphase-sets:  A proposi t ion R is somethingwhich is true or false at each point t of thetime axis U:Value(R,t) = T(rue) or F(alse).A phase is an interval (span or moment) pon the time axis, which a truth value(denoted by q(p)) is ass igned to:q(p) = T: p is an aff i rmative (main-)phase.q(p) = F: p is a decl in ing (secondary) phase.A phase-set  P is a pair \[P~,q\]: P~ is a setof intervals p and q is an evaluat ion func-tion ass igning a truth value to each p6 P~.The subst i tut ion of proposi t ions R byphase-sets P is not unequivocal ,  but alsonot arbitrary.
Some necessary condit ionsfor the re lat ionship between R and its"surrogate" P have been introduced anddiscussed elsewhere (Kunze 1986).
Oneessential  point is that the simple "momentlogic" becomes an "interval logic".This is also connected with quest ions asexpressed by the di f ferent def in i t ions ofHOLD, OCCUR and OCCURING in Al len 1984.Another fact connected with phases is theunsymmetry in the case of a negation:(I) The museum is open today.+ The museum is open all day today.
(2) The museum is closed today.= The museum is closed all day today.The proposi t ion R is supposed to befixed and given.
P is considered as var iableand provides a formal counterpart  ofd i f ferent phase-perspect ives for a certainproposit ion.
The German sentence(3) Thomas raucht.has at least two of them (and consequent lytwo meanings):  "Thomas is a smoker" and"Thomas is smoking".
Furthermore the use ofphases enables us to consider some parts ofT(R) as unimportant,  accidental  or excep-tional.
These parts form decl in ing phasesof R. The af f i rmat ive phases of R need notbe disjunct, and they need not be containedin T(R).
It is also possible to introducenested phases, so that rather compl icatedcourses may be rcpresented.2.
Some formal def in it ions?
= p~ Let PI \[ i' qi \] (i : 1,2) be two phase-sets with P~ : P~.
Then PI and P2 may beconnected by means of sentential  logic:For any functor "o" (e. g. "... and ..."and "if , then . ")

one def inesP~ o P2 D~f \[P~, ql o q21 with P~ : p~ : p~.Phase-operators  connect arbi t rary phase-sets.
As an example we take the phase-operator OCC:\[P~q\] = P : OCC(PI ,P 2) means P~ = PI andI T, if q1(p) = T and there is a p26P2 q(p)= with q2(P2 ) = T and p ~ P2 % @' F otherwise."
" " ~ P2"  If one replaces pnp2 # ~ by p = ,one gets the def in i t ion of P = PER(PI,P2) .P = OCC(PI ,P 2) means "P2 happens during PI"'P = PER(PI'P2) "P2 happens throughout PI"The important point is that these relat ion-ships between PI and P2 are not representedby a Yes-No-decis ion,  but again by a phase-set P: OCC(PI,P2) selects from the T-phasesof the first argument those p for which thecharacter ist ic  condit ion (= there is a P2350with  q2(P2 ) = T and p ~ P2 % @) is fu l f i l l ed .The phase-operator  OCC is not the sameth ing  as OCCUR or OCCURING in A l len  1984.There  are at least  three d i f fe rences :  OCCURis a Yes -No-pred icate ,  has as f i rs t  a rgumentan event  and as second an in terva l land  thearguments  are no sets as in our  case.
Itmakes  at any rate d i f f i cu l t ies  to genera l i zesuch a Yes -No-proper ty  for sets as a rguments .This  is one reason  for our de f in i t ions .
Moreimpor tant  is that  e. g. OCC(P I ,P  2) may beused as a rgument  in another  phase-operator .This  enab les  us to express  qu i te  eas i ly  theessent ia l  t ime re la t ion  in "In Ju ly  there areeven ing-p lanes  on Tuesday  and Fr iday . "
.One needs  some other  operat ions :G iven  P = \[P~,q\], then alt(P) conta insexact ly  those phases  wh ich  one gets by jo in-ing al l  phases  of P wh ich  are not seperatedf rom each  o ther  and have the same q -va lue( induct ive ly  unders tood) .If one des ignates  by U ?
the phase-setcons is t ing  on ly  of U as in terva l  (withq(U) : T) , then alt(P) = U O means that  theun ion  of al l  T -phases  of P covers  thet ime axis  U, i. e. "P is a lways  true".In sect?
I. we a l ready  sketched  how torepresent  p ropos i t ions  R by phase-sets  P.We wr i te  P = <R>.
Now we have to exp la inthe same for tempora l  adverb ia l s :  <tuesday>is a phase--set P, whose  in terva ls  p are thedays, and exact ly  the Tuesdays  have theq -va lue  T. In <day> al l  in te rva ls  (: day)have the q -va lue  T. <1982> is a phase-setw i th  years  as in terva ls ,  but on ly  one(:"1982") has the q -va lue  T. Obv ious lyx<tuesday> is a s ing le  unspec i f ied  Tuesday,x<day> an unspec i f ied  day.3.
ExamplesNow we are ready  to give some examples .Let be R = " John goes to see Mary".
<R> : Pis obv ious ly  the set of a l l  v i s i t s  of Johnto Mary.
Then  we have:(4) In 1982 John want  to see Mary  everyTuesday.is represented  by the fo l low ing  cond i t ion(,,~" for "if ..., then ...") :(5) a l t (<1982> ~ PER (<year> , ...a l t (<tuesday> -~ OCC(<day>,P) ) ) )  : U ?This  has to be read as: It is t rue.

Is R = "Mary be l ievesin John 's  p romise  of marr iage"  and <R> = P,so351(14) a l t (PER(a l t (<tuesday>OCC(<day>,P)) ,P))  = U ?is the corresponding expression for (12).
Ifwe take (13) as ~, (5) becomes(15) alt(<1982> ~ PER(<year>,~)) = U ?and (14) becomes(16) alt(PER(~,P)) = U ?.Using the def in i t ion of PER one gets(17) alt(<~982> ~ PER(<year>,P)) = U ?,which can be paraphrased as(18) During 1982 Mary bel ieved in John'spromise of marriage.This answers a second general question: Timelogical inferences may be based on theseexpressions which represent phase-sets.Another quest ion concerns quant i f icat ion.The expressions avoid the (always trouble-some) quant i f icat ion and render it possibleto per form the inferences rather simply.The quant i f icat ions are "hidden" in thefol lowing sense: The expression(19) Vx3y alt(OCC(XPl ,YP2))  # ~ U ?
(for every T-phase Pl of Pl there is a T-phase P2 of P2 such that P2 happens duringpl ) is equivalent to(20) alt(P I ~ OCC(PI,P2)) = U ?
(an expression without formal quant i f ica-tion!).
It can be proved, that for every ex-pression with ( l inguist ical ly reasonable)quant i f icat ion there is an equivalent  ex-pression without expl ic i t  quant i f icat ion.The expressions ref lect in fact astructure of texts.
The const i tuents ofthis structure belong to two categories:"proposit ional"  and "temporal", where thesecond includes some quant i f icat ions(ever~ Tuesday, ~ on Tuesdays),frequencies (three times), measures (forthree days), (21) gives a s impl i f iedversion of this structure for (12):John want to see Mary p.every Tuesday t. pshe bel ieved ... p.So we have three types of structures (if werestr ict  ourselves to the sentence- level) :(a) the syntact ic structure (e.g.
adependency tree),352(b) the macrostructure as in (21), which hassome features of a const i tuent  tree, butreminds more of categor ia l  grammar, ifone considers the problem thoroughly,(c) the structure of the express ion (14) for(12) .They may be used as interface structures fortwo steps of analysis.
The step from (b) to(c) has to apply rules, which we alreadyused for (5):(22) P every Tuesdayalt(<tuesday> -, OCC(<day>,P))(23) as long as P , P ~ alt(PER(P,P))etc.
It should be noted, that the threeessent ia l  temporal  parts in (21) are ex-pressed by total ly di f ferent means:Tuesday : phase-setevery : ... ~ PO(.. .
