Intentions, rhetoric, or discourse relations ?- a case from mult i l ingual document generationDietmar RSsner**Pro jec t  backgroundThe TECHDOC system \[R5sner, Stede 92b\] is an implemented prototypethat starts from a domain knowledge base about maintenance plans, objectsand actions involved, potential hazards etc.
and delivers simultaneouslygenerated instruction texts in - at the moment - three supported languages(English, German and French).
Our approach is best characterized as anattempt o demonstrate he feasibility of multilingual document generationfrom a kb as an alternative to MT approaches starting from a source text.Empi r i ca l  invest igat ions :  How usefu l  is RST  ?\[n the analysis phase of the project we carefully worked through a cor-pus of multilingual documents: primary focus was on automobile main-tenance manuals.
This work was supplemented by instructional texts forother technical objects (for end consumers as well as technicians, e.g.
air-craft maintenance), software documentation a d other multilingual material(e.g.
tourist information leaflets).
1One of the issues was the question whether an RST 2 representation fdocument structure could serve as intermediate, still language independentlevel mediating 'between' the knowledge base and the texts rendered illdifferent languages.The answer was somewhat of a 'Yes, but ...'.
As reported in more de-tail in \[RSsner, Stede 92a\] it was possible to assign identical RST analysesto corresponding manual sections in English and German, a result againestablished in recent work with the French versions.
This result is not toosurprising iven the fact that multilingual technical documents ypically em-anate from the (more or less adequate) translation of a completely organizednmnolingual 'master copy'.In order to achieve this welcome 'parallelism' some claims of RST hadto be abandoned (cf.
\[R5sner, Stede 92a\]).
One point was the question**c/o FAW, P.O.Box 2060, D - 89010 Ulm, Germany;email: roesner~faw.uni-ulm.de1In addition, we have analyzed a number of German texts taken from press releasesand advertisements, cf.
\[RSsner, Stede 93\].2As others we see the 'rhetoricM' in RST as a misnomer (cf.
e.g.
\[Dale, this volume\])and prefer to talk about 'discourse r lations'.106of 'min imal  un i t s '  of a,.

\[Moser & Moore, this vo\[l|ll|e\]107In tent ions  in technical  documents  ?Technical documentation is provided on purpose: in order to fullill lega.lrequirements (e.g.
EC 1)roduct relia.bility act), a.s a marketing a.id, as aservice to the customer, etc..
In addition to such global motivations otherintentions influence the strategic and ta+ctical decisions of 'What  should becommunicated ?'
and 'How shouhl this be done ?
'.The l)rimary strategic intention is 'ENABLEMENT to A(~T'.
The bestway to t'ultill this is to provide all information that enables the customerto make best use of the product, to maintain or troul)leshoot i , to avoidhazards, etc.. As a tactica.1 issue this information shall I>e orga.niz(,d toenhance nntlersta\]tda.bility and ease of a.ccess, it shall I)e pres(,nted il, a.concise manner, but nevertheless l>e complete (at lea.st when ta.king 'norma.l'inferences into account).Some of these intentions (e.g.
ea.se of processing and ul,h,rsl, anding) seemto be 'compiled' into the c(mventiona+l, schema.tized way l.t~ urga.nize mainte-nance ma.nu;tl texts.
A very obvious exa.mple is tha.t steps to I)e lmrl'ormedare mentioned in the texts in the order of their exet'utitm, s Among otheraspects this allows to easily synchronize reading tlm text and performingthe actions; although other orders are imaginal)le thes(, would demand iorexplicit signalling a.nd thus increase the efl'ort for both writer a.nd reader.Discuss ion:  Towards a unif ied v iew ?Although \[Mann and Thompson 87\] rel)ort tha.t 'virtually every text ha.s anRST ana.lysis' (p. 20), they fi'a.nkly admit that 'certai\]l text types cha.ra.
('-teristica.lly do not have RST a.na.lyses'.
But wha.t, if merely being assignedan R.ST analysis is not a sufficient account for a text '.~As ln;tterial tbr the discussion, see the following short l~a,ragral)h fi'om aDOS user guide:"The  IBM personal  COmlmtvr di,~k opera.ling ,~y,~tem (DOS) controls themovement  ot' intbrnJation tm the ('ollll~llter.

No other example of the well known lists of discourse rela.tions eelnsto be adequate nough.
But what would we gain fl'om such a.n a.lm.lysis ?We have to look at the example fl'om another angle: the introductionof the anMogy is functional for the writer's intention that the reader bestunderstands on a high level what DOS is intended ior.
To put it ia otherwords: There is no reason based on mere content o talk about DOS and totalk about a policeman directing traffic.
Only the pedagogical intentions ofmaking the text understa.ndM)le give a reason to make up the analogy andto transfer the analogy 1):Lck to the main topic.In this sense discourse relations houhl be interl)reted a.s rea.lizi,lg under-lying intentions and they a.re best discussed as a, 'repertoire' tha.t a.llows tol)ursue intentions.
