Evaluating WordNet-based Measuresof Lexical Semantic RelatednessAlexander Budanitsky?University of TorontoGraeme Hirst?University of TorontoThe quantification of lexical semantic relatedness has many applications in NLP, and manydifferent measures have been proposed.
We evaluate five of these measures, all of which useWordNet as their central resource, by comparing their performance in detecting and correctingreal-word spelling errors.
An information-content?based measure proposed by Jiang andConrath is found superior to those proposed by Hirst and St-Onge, Leacock and Chodorow, Lin,and Resnik.
In addition, we explain why distributional similarity is not an adequate proxy forlexical semantic relatedness.1.
IntroductionThe need to determine semantic relatedness or its inverse, semantic distance, be-tween two lexically expressed concepts is a problem that pervades much of naturallanguage processing.
Measures of relatedness or distance are used in such applica-tions as word sense disambiguation, determining the structure of texts, text sum-marization and annotation, information extraction and retrieval, automatic indexing,lexical selection, and the automatic correction of word errors in text.
It?s importantto note that semantic relatedness is a more general concept than similarity; similarentities are semantically related by virtue of their similarity (bank?trust company), butdissimilar entities may also be semantically related by lexical relationships such asmeronymy (car?wheel) and antonymy (hot?cold), or just by any kind of functional rela-tionship or frequent association (pencil?paper, penguin?Antarctica, rain?flood).
Computa-tional applications typically require relatedness rather than just similarity; for example,money and river are cues to the in-context meaning of bank that are just as good astrust company.However, it is frequently unclear how to assess the relative merits of the manycompeting approaches that have been proposed for determining lexical semantic re-latedness.
Given a measure of relatedness, how can we tell whether it is a goodone or a poor one?
Given two measures, how can we tell whether one is bet-ter than the other, and under what conditions it is better?
And what is it thatmakes some measures better than others?
Our purpose in this paper is to comparethe performance of a number of measures of semantic relatedness that have beenproposed for use in applications in natural language processing and informationretrieval.?

2006 Association for Computational LinguisticsComputational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 11.1 Terminology and NotationIn the literature related to this topic, at least three different terms are used by differ-ent authors or sometimes interchangeably by the same authors: semantic relatedness,similarity, and semantic distance.Resnik (1995) attempts to demonstrate the distinction between the first two by wayof example.
?Cars and gasoline?, he writes, ?would seem to be more closely relatedthan, say, cars and bicycles, but the latter pair are certainly more similar.?
Similarityis thus a special case of semantic relatedness, and we adopt this perspective in thispaper.
Among other relationships that the notion of relatedness encompasses are thevarious kinds of meronymy, antonymy, functional association, and other ?non-classicalrelations?
(Morris and Hirst 2004).The term semantic distance may cause even more confusion, as it can be usedwhen talking about either just similarity or relatedness in general.
Two concepts are?close?
to one another if their similarity or their relatedness is high, and otherwisethey are ?distant?.
Most of the time, these two uses are consistent with one another,but not always; antonymous concepts are dissimilar and hence distant in one sense,and yet are strongly related semantically and hence close in the other sense.
We wouldthus have very much preferred to be able to adhere to the view of semantic distanceas the inverse of semantic relatedness, not merely of similarity, in the present paper.Unfortunately, because of the sheer number of methods measuring similarity, as wellas those measuring distance as the ?opposite?
of similarity, this would have madefor an awkward presentation.
Therefore, we have to ask the reader to rely on contextwhen interpreting what exactly the expressions semantic distance, semantically distant,and semantically close mean in each particular case.Various approaches presented below speak of concepts and words.
As a means ofacknowledging the polysemy of language, in this paper the term concept will refer to aparticular sense of a given word.
We want to be very clear that, throughout this paper,when we say that two words are ?similar?, this is a short way of saying that they denotesimilar concepts; we are not talking about similarity of distributional or co-occurrencebehavior of the words, for which the term word similarity has also been used (Dagan2000; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999).
While similarity of denotation might be inferredfrom similarity of distributional or co-occurrence behavior (Dagan 2000; Weeds 2003),the two are distinct ideas.
We return to the relationship between them in Section 6.2.When we refer to hierarchies and networks of concepts, we will use both the termslink and edge to refer to the relationships between nodes; we prefer the former termwhen our view emphasizes the taxonomic aspect or the meaning of the network, andthe latter when our view emphasizes algorithmic or graph-theoretic aspects.
In runningtext, examples of concepts are typeset in sans-serif font, whereas examples of wordsare given in italics; in formulas, concepts and words will usually be denoted by cand w, with various subscripts.
For the sake of uniformity of presentation, we havetaken the liberty of altering the original notation accordingly in some other authors?formulas.2.
Lexical Resource?based Approaches to Measuring Semantic RelatednessAll approaches to measuring semantic relatedness that use a lexical resource construethe resource, in one way or another, as a network or directed graph, and then base themeasure of relatedness on properties of paths in this graph.14Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic Relatedness2.1 Dictionary-based ApproachesKozima and Furugori (1993) turned the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English(LDOCE) (Procter 1978) into a network by creating a node for every headword andlinking each node to the nodes for all the words used in its definition.
The 2851-word controlled defining vocabulary of LDOCE thus becomes the densest part of thenetwork: the remaining nodes, which represent the headwords outside of the definingvocabulary, can be pictured as being situated at the fringe of the network, as they arelinked only to defining-vocabulary nodes and not to each other.
In this network, thesimilarity function simKF between words of the defining vocabulary is computed bymeans of spreading activation on this network.
The function is extended to the restof LDOCE by representing each word as a list W = {w1, .
.
.
, wr} of the words in itsdefinition; thus, for instance,simKF(linguistics, stylistics)= simKF({the, study, of, language, in, general, and, of, particular,languages, and, their, structure, and, grammar, and, history},{the, study, of, style, in, written, or, spoken, language})Kozima and Ito (1997) built on this work to derive a context-sensitive, or dynamic,measure that takes into account the ?associative direction?
of a given word pair.
Forexample, the context {car, bus} imposes the associative direction of vehicle (close wordsare then likely to include taxi, railway, airplane, etc.
), whereas the context {car, engine}imposes the direction of components of car (tire, seat, headlight, etc.
).2.2 Approaches Based on Roget-structured ThesauriRoget-structured thesauri, such as Roget?s Thesaurus itself, the Macquarie Thesaurus(Bernard 1986), and others, group words in a structure based on categories within whichthere are several levels of finer clustering.
The categories themselves are grouped intoa number of broad, loosely defined classes.
However, while the classes and categoriesare named, the finer divisions are not; the words are clustered without attempting toexplicitly indicate how and why they are related.
The user?s main access is throughthe index, which contains category numbers along with labels representative of thosecategories for each word.
Polysemes are implicitly disambiguated, to a certain extent,by the other words in their cluster and in their index entry.
Closely related conceptsmight or might not be physically close in the thesaurus: ?Physical closeness has someimportance .
.
.
but words in the index of the thesaurus often have widely scatteredcategories, and each category often points to a widely scattered selection of cate-gories?
(Morris and Hirst 1991).
Methods of semantic distance that are based on Roget-structured thesauri therefore rely not only on the category structure but also on theindex and on the pointers within categories that cross-reference other categories.
Inpart as a consequence of this, typically no numerical value for semantic distance canbe obtained: rather, algorithms using the thesaurus compute a distance implicitly andreturn a boolean value of ?close?
or ?not close?.Working with an abridged version of Roget?s Thesaurus, Morris and Hirst (1991)identified five types of semantic relations between words.
In their approach, two words15Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1were deemed to be related to one another, or semantically close, if their base formssatisfy any one of the following conditions:1.
They have a category in common in their index entries.2.
One has a category in its index entry that contains a pointer to a categoryof the other.3.
One is either a label in the other?s index entry or is in a category of theother.4.
They are both contained in the same subcategory.5.
They both have categories in their index entries that point to a commoncategory.These relations account for such pairings as wife and married, car and driving, blind andsee, reality and theoretically, brutal and terrified.
(However, different editions of Roget?sThesaurus yield somewhat different sets of relations.)
Of the five types of relations,perhaps the most intuitively plausible ones ?
the first two in the list above ?
werefound to validate over 90% of the intuitive lexical relationships that the authors used asa benchmark in their experiments.Jarmasz and Szpakowicz (2003) also implemented a similarity measure with Roget?sThesaurus; but because this measure is based strictly on hierachy rather than the indexstructure, we discuss it in Section 2.4 below.2.3 Approaches Using WordNet and Other Semantic NetworksMost of the methods discussed in the remainder of Section 2 use WordNet (Fellbaum1998), a broad coverage lexical network of English words.
Nouns, verbs, adjectives,and adverbs are each organized into networks of synonym sets (synsets) that eachrepresent one underlying lexical concept and are interlinked with a variety of relations.
(A polysemous word will appear in one synset for each of its senses.)
In the first versionsof WordNet (those numbered 1.x), the networks for the four different parts of speechwere not linked to one another.1 The noun network of WordNet was the first to be richlydeveloped, and most of the researchers whose work we will discuss below thereforelimited themselves to this network.2The backbone of the noun network is the subsumption hierarchy (hyponymy/hypernymy), which accounts for close to 80% of the relations.
At the top of the hier-archy are 11 abstract concepts, termed unique beginners, such as entity (?somethinghaving concrete existence; living or nonliving?)
and psychological feature (?a feature ofthe mental life of a living organism?).
The maximum depth of the noun hierarchy is16 nodes.
The nine types of relations defined on the noun subnetwork, in addition tothe synonymy relation that is implicit in each node are: the hyponymy (IS-A) relation,1 We began this work with WordNet 1.5, and stayed with this version despite newer releases in orderto maintain strict comparability.
Our experiments were complete before WordNet 2.0 was released.2 It seems to have been tacitly assumed by these researchers that results would generalize to the networkhierarchies of other parts of speech.
Nonetheless, Resnik and Diab (2000) caution that the properties ofverbs and nouns might be different enough that they should be treated as separate problems, and recentresearch by Banerjee and Pedersen (2003) supports this assumption: they found that in a word-sensedisambiguation task, their gloss-overlap measure of semantic relatedness (see Section 6.1 below)performed far worse on verbs (and slightly worse on adjectives) than it did on nouns.16Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic Relatednessand its inverse, hypernymy; six meronymic (PART-OF) relations ?
COMPONENT-OF,MEMBER-OF and SUBSTANCE-OF and their inverses; and antonymy, the COMPLEMENT-OF relation.In discussing WordNet, we use the following definitions and notation: The length of the shortest path in WordNet from synset ci to synset cj(measured in edges or nodes) is denoted by len(ci, cj).
We stipulate aglobal root root above the 11 unique beginners to ensure the existenceof a path between any two nodes. The depth of a node is the length of the path to it from the global root,i.e., depth(ci) = len(root, ci). We write lso(c1, c2) for the lowest super-ordinate (or most specificcommon subsumer) of c1 and c2. Given any formula rel(c1, c2) for semantic relatedness between twoconcepts c1 and c2, the relatedness rel(w1, w2) between two words w1and w2 can be calculated asrel(w1, w2) = maxc1?s(w1),c2?s(w2 )[rel(c1, c2)] (1)where s(wi) is ?the set of concepts in the taxonomy that are senses of wordwi?
(Resnik 1995).
That is, the relatedness of two words is equal to that ofthe most-related pair of concepts that they denote.2.4 Computing Taxonomic Path LengthA simple way to compute semantic relatedness in a taxonomy such as WordNet is toview it as a graph and identify relatedness with path length between the concepts:?The shorter the path from one node to another, the more similar they are?
(Resnik1995).
This approach was taken, for example, by Rada and colleagues (Rada et al 1989;Rada and Bicknell 1989), not on WordNet but on MeSH (Medical Subject Headings),a semantic hierarchy of terms used for indexing articles in the bibliographic retrievalsystem Medline.
The network?s 15,000 terms form a nine-level hierarchy based on theBROADER-THAN relationship.
The principal assumption of Rada and colleagues wasthat ?the number of edges between terms in the MeSH hierarchy is a measure ofconceptual distance between terms?.
Despite the simplicity of this distance function,the authors were able to obtain surprisingly good results in their information retrievaltask.
In part, their success can be explained by the observation of Lee, Kim, andLee (1993) that while ?in the context of .
.
.
semantic networks, shortest path lengthsbetween two concepts are not sufficient to represent conceptual distance betweenthose concepts .
.
.
when the paths are restricted to IS-A links, the shortest path lengthdoes measure conceptual distance.?
Another component of their success is certainlythe specificity of the domain, which ensures relative homogeneity of the hierarchy.Notwithstanding these qualifications, Jarmasz and Szpakowicz (2003) also achievedgood results with Roget?s Thesaurus by ignoring the index and treating the thesaurusas a simple hierarchy of clusters.
They computed semantic similarity between twowords as the length of the shortest path between them.
The words were not explicitlydisambiguated.17Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1Hirst and St-Onge (1998; St-Onge 1995) adapted Morris and Hirst?s (1991) seman-tic distance algorithm from Roget?s Thesaurus to WordNet.3 They distinguished twostrengths of semantic relations in WordNet.
Two words are strongly related if one ofthe following holds:1.
They have a synset in common (for example, human and person).2.
They are associated with two different synsets that are connected by theantonymy relation (for example, precursor and successor).3.
One of the words is a compound (or a phrase) that includes the other and?there is any kind of link at all between a synset associated with eachword?
(for example, school and private school).Two words are said to be in a medium-strong, or regular, relation if there exists anallowable path connecting a synset associated with each word (for example, carrot andapple).
A path is allowable if it contains no more than five links and conforms to oneof eight patterns, the intuition behind which is that ?the longer the path and the morechanges of direction, the lower the weight?.
The details of the patterns are outside ofthe scope of this paper; all we need to know for the purposes of subsequent discussionis that an allowable path may include more than one link and that the directions oflinks on the same path may vary (among upward (hypernymy and meronymy), downward(hyponymy and holonymy) and horizontal (antonymy)).
Hirst and St-Onge?s approach maythus be summarized by the following formula for two WordNet concepts c1 = c2:relHS(c1, c2) = C ?
len(c1, c2) ?
k ?
turns(c1, c2) (2)where C and k are constants (in practice, they used C = 8 and k = 1), and turns(c1, c2) isthe number of times the path between c1 and c2 changes direction.2.5 Scaling the NetworkDespite its apparent simplicity, a widely acknowledged problem with the edge-counting approach is that it typically ?relies on the notion that links in the taxonomyrepresent uniform distances?, which is typically not true: ?there is a wide variabilityin the ?distance?
covered by a single taxonomic link, particularly when certain sub-taxonomies (e.g., biological categories) are much denser than others?
(Resnik 1995).For instance, in WordNet, the link rabbit ears IS-A television antenna covers an intuitivelynarrow distance, whereas white elephant IS-A possession covers an intuitively wide one.The approaches discussed below are attempts undertaken by various researchers toovercome this problem.2.5.1 Sussna?s Depth-relative Scaling.
Sussna?s (1993, 1997) approach to scaling isbased on his observation that sibling-concepts deep in a taxonomy appear to be moreclosely related to one another than those higher up.
His method construes each edge3 The original ideas and definitions of Hirst and St-Onge (1998) (including those for the direction oflinks ?
see below) were intended to apply to all parts of speech and the entire range of relations featuredin the WordNet ontology (which include cause, pertinence, also see, etc.).
Like other researchers, however,they had to resort to the noun subnetwork only.
In what follows, therefore, we will use appropriatelyrestricted versions of their notions.18Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic Relatednessin the WordNet noun network as consisting of two directed edges representing inverserelations.
Each relation r has a weight or a range [minr; maxr] of weights associated withit: for example, hypernymy, hyponymy, holonymy, and meronymy have weights betweenminr = 1 and maxr = 2.4 The weight of each edge of type r from some node c1 isreduced by a factor that depends on the number of edges, edgesr, of the same typeleaving c1:wt(c1 ?r) = maxr ?maxr ?
minredgesr(c1)(3)The distance between two adjacent nodes c1 and c2 is then the average of the weightson each direction of the edge, scaled by the depth of the nodes:distS(c1, c2) =wt(c1 ?r) + wt(c2 ?r?
)2 ?
max{depth(c1), depth(c2)}(4)where r is the relation that holds between c1 and c2 and r?
is its inverse (i.e., the relationthat holds between c2 and c1).
Finally, the semantic distance between two arbitrarynodes ci and cj is the sum of the distances between the pairs of adjacent nodes alongthe shortest path connecting them.2.5.2 Wu and Palmer?s Conceptual Similarity.
In a paper on translating English verbsinto Mandarin Chinese, Wu and Palmer (1994) introduce a scaled metric for what theycall conceptual similarity between a pair of concepts c1 and c2 in a hierarchy assimWP(c1, c2) =2 ?
depth(lso(c1, c2))len(c1, lso(c1, c2)) + len(c2, lso(c1, c2)) + 2 ?
depth(lso(c1, c2))(5)Note that depth(lso(c1, c2)) is the ?global?
depth in the hierarchy; its role as a scalingfactor can be seen more clearly if we recast equation 5 from similarity into distance:distWP(c1, c2) = 1 ?
simWP(c1, c2)=len(c1, lso(c1, c2)) + len(c2, lso(c1, c2))len(c1, lso(c1, c2)) + len(c2, lso(c1, c2)) + 2 ?
depth(lso(c1, c2))(6)2.5.3 Leacock and Chodorow?s Normalized Path Length.
Leacock and Chodorow(1998) proposed the following formula for computing the scaled semantic similaritybetween concepts c1 and c2 in WordNet:simLC(c1, c2) = ?
loglen(c1, c2)2 ?
maxc?WordNetdepth(c)(7)Here, the denominator includes the maximum depth of the hierarchy.4 Sussna?s experiments proved the precise details of the weighting scheme to be material only infine-tuning the performance.19Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 12.6 Information-based and Integrated ApproachesLike the methods in the preceding subsection, the final group of approaches that wepresent attempt to counter problems inherent in a general ontology by incorporating anadditional, and qualitatively different, knowledge source, namely information from acorpus.2.6.1 Resnik?s Information-based Approach.
The key idea underlying Resnik?s (1995)approach is the intuition that one criterion of similarity between two concepts is ?theextent to which they share information in common?, which in an IS-A taxonomy canbe determined by inspecting the relative position of the most-specific concept thatsubsumes them both.
This intuition seems to be indirectly captured by edge-countingmethods (such as that of Rada and colleagues; section 2.4 above), in that ?if the minimalpath of IS-A links between two nodes is long, that means it is necessary to go high in thetaxonomy, to more abstract concepts, in order to find a least upper bound?.
An examplegiven by Resnik is the difference in the relative positions of the most-specific subsumerof nickel and dime ?
coin ?
and that of nickel and credit card ?
medium of exchange, asseen in Figure 1.In mathematical terms, for any concept c in the taxonomy, let p(c) be the probabil-ity of encountering an instance of concept c. Following the standard definition frominformation theory, the information content of c, IC(c), is then ?
log p(c).
Thus, we candefine the semantic similarity of a pair of concepts c1 and c2, assimR(c1, c2) = ?
log p(lso(c1, c2)).
(8)Notice that p is monotonic as one moves up the taxonomy: if c1 IS-A c2 then p(c1) ?
p(c2).For example, whenever we encounter a nickel, we have encountered a coin (Figure 1),so p(nickel) ?
p(coin).
As a consequence, the higher the position of the most-specificsubsumer for given two concepts in the taxonomy (i.e., the more abstract it is), the lowertheir similarity.
In particular, if the taxonomy has a unique top node, its probabilitywill be 1, so if the most-specific subsumer of a pair of concepts is the top node, theirsimilarity will be ?
log(1) = 0, as desired.Figure 1Fragment of the WordNet taxonomy, showing most-specific subsumers of nickel and dime and ofnickel and credit card.
Solid lines represent IS-A links; dashed lines indicate that some interveningnodes have been omitted.
Adapted from Resnik (1995).20Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic RelatednessIn Resnik?s experiments, the probabilities of concepts in the taxonomy were esti-mated from noun frequencies gathered from the one-million-word Brown Corpus ofAmerican English (Francis and Kuc?era 1982).
The key characteristic of his countingmethod is that an individual occurrence of any noun in the corpus ?was counted asan occurrence of each taxonomic class containing it?.
For example, an occurrence ofthe noun nickel was, in accordance with Figure 1, counted towards the frequency ofnickel, coin, and so forth.
Notice that, as a consequence of using raw (non-disambiguated)data, encountering a polysemous word contributes to the counts of all its senses.
So inthe case of nickel, the counts of both the coin and the metal senses will be increased.Formally,p(c) =?w?W(c) count(w)N (9)where W(c) is the set of words (nouns) in the corpus whose senses are subsumed byconcept c, and N is the total number of word (noun) tokens in the corpus that are alsopresent in WordNet.Thus Resnik?s approach attempts to deal with the problem of varying link distances(see Section 2.5) by generally downplaying the role of network edges in the determi-nation of the degree of semantic proximity: Edges are used solely for locating super-ordinates of a pair of concepts; in particular, the number of links does not figure in anyof the formulas pertaining to the method; and numerical evidence comes from corpusstatistics, which are associated with nodes.
This rather selective use of the structureof the taxonomy has its drawbacks, one of which is the indistinguishability, in terms ofsemantic distance, of any two pairs of concepts having the same most-specific subsumer.For example, in Figure 1, we find that simR(money, credit) = simR(dime, credit card), be-cause in each case the lso is medium of exchange, whereas, for an edge-based methodsuch as Leacock and Chodorow?s (Section 2.5.3), clearly this is not so, as the number ofedges in each case is different.2.6.2 Jiang and Conrath?s Combined Approach.
Reacting to the disadvantages ofResnik?s method, Jiang and Conrath?s (1997) idea was to synthesize edge- and node-based techniques by restoring network edges to their dominant role in similarity com-putations, and using corpus statistics as a secondary, corrective factor.
A completeexegesis of their work is presented by Budanitsky (1999); here we summarize only theirconclusions.In the framework of the IS-A hierarchy, Jiang and Conrath postulated that thesemantic distance of the link connecting a child-concept c to its parent-concept par(c)is proportional to the conditional probability p(c | par(c)) of encountering an instance ofc given an instance of par(c).
More specifically,distJC(c, par(c)) = ?
log p(c | par(c)) (10)By definition,p(c | par(c)) = p(c&par(c))p(par(c))(11)21Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1If we adopt Resnik?s scheme for assigning probabilities to concepts (Section 2.6.1),then p(c&par(c)) = p(c), since any instance of a child is automatically an instance ofits parent.
Then,p(c|par(c)) = p(c)p(par(c))(12)and, recalling the definition of information content,distJC(c, par(c)) = IC(c) ?
IC(par(c)) (13)Given this as the measure of semantic distance from a node to its immediate parent,the semantic distance between an arbitrary pair of nodes was taken, as per commonpractice, to be the sum of the distances along the shortest path that connects the nodes:distJC(c1, c2) =?c?Path(c1,c2 )lso(c1,c2 )distJC(c, par(c)) (14)where Path(c1, c2) is the set of all the nodes in the shortest path from c1 to c2.
The nodelso(c1, c2) is removed from Path(c1, c2) in (14)), because it has no parent in the set.
Ex-panding the sum in the right-hand side of equation (14), plugging in the expression forparent?child distance from equation (13), and performing necessary eliminations resultsin the following final formula for the semantic distance between concepts c1 and c2:distJC(c1, c2) = IC(c1) + IC(c2) ?
2 ?
IC(lso(c1, c2)) (15)= 2 log p(lso(c1, c2)) ?
(log p(c1) + log p(c2)) (16)2.6.3 Lin?s Universal Similarity Measure.
Noticing that all of the similarity measuresknown to him were tied to a particular application, domain, or resource, Lin (1998b)attempted to define a measure of similarity that would be both universal (applicableto arbitrary objects and ?not presuming any form of knowledge representation?)
andtheoretically justified (?derived from a set of assumptions?, instead of ?directly by aformula?, so that ?if the assumptions are deemed reasonable, the similarity measurenecessarily follows?).
He used the following three intuitions as a basis:1.
The similarity between arbitrary objects A and B is related to theircommonality; the more commonality they share, the more similar they are.2.
The similarity between A and B is related to the differences between them;the more differences they have, the less similar they are.3.
The maximum similarity between A and B is reached when A and B areidentical, no matter how much commonality they share.Lin defined the commonality between A and B as the information content of ?theproposition that states the commonalities?
between them, formallyIC(comm(A, B)) (17)22Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic Relatednessand the difference between A and B asIC(descr(A, B)) ?
IC(comm(A, B)) (18)where descr(A, B) is a proposition describing what A and B are.Given these assumptions and definitions and the apparatus of information theory,Lin proved the following:Similarity Theorem: The similarity between A and B is measured by the ratio betweenthe amount of information needed to state their commonality and the informationneeded to fully describe what they are:simL(A, B) =log p(comm(A, B))log p(descr(A, B))(19)His measure of similarity between two concepts in a taxonomy is a corollary of thistheorem:simL(c1, c2) =2 ?
log p(lso(c1, c2))log p(c1) + log p(c2)(20)where the probabilities p(c) are determined in a manner analogous to Resnik?s p(c)(equation (9)).3.
Evaluation MethodsHow can we reason about and evaluate computational measures of semantic related-ness?
Three kinds of approaches are prevalent in the literature.The first kind (Wei 1993; Lin 1998b) is a (chiefly) theoretical examination of a pro-posed measure for those mathematical properties thought desirable, such as whetherit is a metric (or the inverse of a metric), whether it has singularities, whether itsparameter-projections are smooth functions, and so on.
In our opinion, such analysesact at best as a coarse filter in the comparison of a set of measures and an even coarserone in the assessment of a single measure.The second kind of evaluation is comparison with human judgments.
Insofar ashuman judgments of similarity and relatedness are deemed to be correct by definition,this clearly gives the best assessment of the ?goodness?
of a measure.
Its main drawbacklies in the difficulty of obtaining a large set of reliable, subject-independent judgmentsfor comparison ?
designing a psycholinguistic experiment, validating its results, and soon.
(In Section 4.1 below, we will employ the rather limited data that such experimentshave obtained to date.
)The third approach is to evaluate the measures with respect to their performancein the framework of a particular application.
If some particular NLP system requires ameasure of semantic relatedness, we can compare different measures by seeing whichone the system is most effective with, while holding all other aspects of the systemconstant.In the remainder of this paper, we will use the second and the third methodsto compare several different measures (Sections 4 and 5 respectively).
We focus onmeasures that use WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) as their knowledge source (to keepthat as a constant) and that permit straightforward implementation as functions in a23Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1programming language.
Therefore, we select the following five measures: Hirst andSt-Onge?s (Section 2.4), Jiang and Conrath?s (Section 2.6.2), Leacock and Chodorow?s(Section 2.5.3), Lin?s (Section 2.6.3), and Resnik?s (Section 2.6.1).5 The first is claimed asa measure of semantic relatedness because it uses all noun relations in WordNet; theothers are claimed only as measures of similarity because they use only the hyponymyrelation.
We implemented each measure, and used the Brown Corpus as the basis forthe frequency counts needed in the information-based approaches.64.
Comparison with Human Ratings of Semantic RelatednessIn this section we compare the five chosen measures by how well they reflect humanjudgments of semantic relatedness.
In addition, we will use the data that we obtainin this section to set closeness thresholds for the application-based evaluation of eachmeasure in Section 5.4.1 DataAs part of an investigation into ?the relationship between similarity of context andsimilarity of meaning (synonymy)?, Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) obtained?synonymy judgements?
from 51 human subjects on 65 pairs of words.
The pairsranged from ?highly synonymous?
to ?semantically unrelated?, and the subjects wereasked to rate them, on the scale of 0.0 to 4.0, according to their ?similarity of mean-ing?
(see Table 1, columns 2 and 3).
For a similar study, Miller and Charles (1991)chose 30 pairs from the original 65, taking 10 from the ?high level (between 3 and4.
.
.
), 10 from the intermediate level (between 1 and 3), and 10 from the low level(0 to 1) of semantic similarity?, and then obtained similarity judgments from 38 sub-jects, given the same instructions as above, on those 30 pairs (see Table 2, columns 2and 3).74.2 MethodFor each of our five implemented measures, we obtained similarity or relatedness scoresfor the human-rated pairs.
Where either or both of the words had more than one synsetin WordNet, we took the most-related pair of synsets.
For the measures of Resnik, Jiangand Conrath, and Lin, this replicates and extends a study by each of the original authorsof their own measure.5 We also attempted to implement Sussna?s (1993, 1997) measure (Section 2.5.1), but ran into problemsbecause a key element depended closely on the particulars of an earlier version of WordNet; see(Budanitsky 1999) for details.
We did not include Wu and Palmer?s measure (Section 2.5.2) because Lin(1998b) has shown it to be a special case of his measure in which all child?parent probabilities are equal.6 In their original experiments, Lin and Jiang and Conrath used SemCor, a sense-tagged subset of theBrown Corpus, as their empirical data; but we decided to follow Resnik in using the full and untaggedcorpus.
While this means trading accuracy for size, we believe that using a non-disambiguated corpusconstitutes a more-general approach, as the availability and size of disambiguated texts such as SemCoris highly limited.7 As a result of a typographical error that occurred in the course of either Miller and Charles?s actualexperiments or in its publication, the Rubenstein?Goodenough pair cord?smile became chord?smile.Probably because of the comparable degree of (dis)similarity, the error was not discovered and thelatter pair has been used in all subsequent work.24Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic RelatednessTable 1Human and computer ratings of the Rubenstein?Goodenough set of word pairs (part 1 of 2).# Pair Humans relHS distJC simLC simL simR1 cord smile 0.02 0 19.6 1.38 0.09 1.172 rooster voyage 0.04 0 26.9 0.91 0.00 0.003 noon string 0.04 0 22.6 1.50 0.00 0.004 fruit furnace 0.05 0 18.5 2.28 0.14 1.855 autograph shore 0.06 0 22.7 1.38 0.00 0.006 automobile wizard 0.11 0 17.8 1.50 0.09 0.977 mound stove 0.14 0 17.2 2.28 0.22 2.908 grin implement 0.18 0 16.6 1.28 0.00 0.009 asylum fruit 0.19 0 19.5 2.28 0.14 1.8510 asylum monk 0.39 0 25.6 1.62 0.07 0.9711 graveyard madhouse 0.42 0 29.7 1.18 0.00 0.0012 glass magician 0.44 0 22.8 1.91 0.07 0.9713 boy rooster 0.44 0 17.8 1.50 0.21 2.3814 cushion jewel 0.45 0 22.9 2.28 0.13 1.8515 monk slave 0.57 94 18.9 2.76 0.21 2.5316 asylum cemetery 0.79 0 28.1 1.50 0.00 0.0017 coast forest 0.85 0 20.2 2.28 0.12 1.5018 grin lad 0.88 0 20.8 1.28 0.00 0.0019 shore woodland 0.90 93 19.3 2.50 0.13 1.5020 monk oracle 0.91 0 22.7 2.08 0.18 2.5321 boy sage 0.96 93 19.9 2.50 0.20 2.5322 automobile cushion 0.97 98 15.0 2.08 0.27 2.9023 mound shore 0.97 91 12.4 2.76 0.49 6.1924 lad wizard 0.99 94 16.5 2.76 0.23 2.5325 forest graveyard 1.00 0 24.5 1.76 0.00 0.0026 food rooster 1.09 0 17.4 1.38 0.10 0.9727 cemetery woodland 1.18 0 25.0 1.76 0.00 0.0028 shore voyage 1.22 0 23.7 1.38 0.00 0.0029 bird woodland 1.24 0 18.1 2.08 0.13 1.5030 coast hill 1.26 94 10.8 2.76 0.53 6.1931 furnace implement 1.37 93 15.8 2.50 0.18 1.8532 crane rooster 1.41 0 12.8 2.08 0.58 8.8833 hill woodland 1.48 93 18.2 2.50 0.14 1.5034 car journey 1.55 0 16.3 1.28 0.00 0.0035 cemetery mound 1.69 0 23.8 1.91 0.00 0.0036 glass jewel 1.78 0 22.0 2.08 0.14 1.8537 magician oracle 1.82 98 1.0 3.50 0.96 13.5838 crane implement 2.37 94 15.6 2.76 0.27 2.9039 brother lad 2.41 94 16.3 2.76 0.23 2.5340 sage wizard 2.46 93 22.8 2.50 0.18 2.5341 oracle sage 2.61 0 26.2 2.08 0.16 2.5342 bird crane 2.63 97 7.4 3.08 0.70 8.8843 bird cock 2.63 150 5.4 4.08 0.76 8.8844 food fruit 2.69 0 10.2 2.28 0.22 1.5045 brother monk 2.74 93 19.2 2.50 0.20 2.5346 asylum madhouse 3.04 150 0.2 4.08 0.99 15.7047 furnace stove 3.11 0 20.5 2.08 0.13 1.8548 magician wizard 3.21 200 0.00 5.08 1.00 13.5849 hill mound 3.29 200 0.00 5.08 1.00 12.0850 cord string 3.41 150 2.2 4.08 0.89 9.2551 glass tumbler 3.45 150 5.9 4.08 0.79 11.3452 grin smile 3.46 200 0.0 5.08 1.00 10.4153 serf slave 3.46 0 19.8 2.28 0.34 5.2854 journey voyage 3.58 150 5.2 4.08 0.74 7.7125Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1Table 1(cont.

and the ratings of the Rubenstein?Goodenough andMiller?Charles word pairs produced by (our implementations of) the Hirst?St-Onge,Jiang?Conrath, Leacock?Chodorow, Lin, and Resnik measures of relatedness are givenin Tables 1 and 2, and in Figures 2 and 3.84.4 DiscussionWhen comparing two sets of ratings, we are interested in the strength of the linear asso-ciation between two quantitative variables, so we follow Resnik (1995) in summarizingthe comparison results by means of the coefficient of correlation of each computationalmeasure with the human ratings; see Table 3.
(For Jiang and Conrath?s measure, thecoefficients are negative because their measure returns distance rather than similarity;so for convenience, we show absolute values in the table.
)94.4.1 Comparison to Upper Bound.
To get an idea of the upper bound on perfor-mance of a computational measure, we can again refer to human performance.
Wehave such an upper bound for the Miller and Charles word pairs (but not for thecomplete set of Rubenstein and Goodenough pairs): Resnik (1995) replicated Miller and8 We have kept the original orderings of the pairs: from dissimilar to similar for the Rubenstein?Goodenough data and from similar to dissimilar for Miller?Charles.
This explains why the two groupsof graphs (Figures 2 and 3) as wholes have the opposite directions.
Notice that because distJC measuresdistance, the Jiang?Conrath plot has a slope opposite to the rest of each group.9 Resnik (1995), Jiang and Conrath (1997), and Lin (1998b) report the coefficients of correlation betweentheir measures and the Miller?Charles ratings to be 0.7911, 0.8282, and 0.8339, respectively, which differslightly from the corresponding figures in Table 3.
These discrepancies can be explained by possibleminor differences in implementation (e.g., the compound-word recognition mechanism used in collectingthe frequency data), differences between the versions of WordNet used in the experiments (Resnik), anddifferences in the corpora used to obtain the frequency data (Jiang and Conrath, Lin).
Also, thecoefficients reported by Resnik and Lin are actually based on only 28 out of the 30 Miller?Charles pairsbecause of a noun missing from an earlier version of WordNet.
Jarmasz and Szpakowicz (2003) repeatedthe experiment, obtaining similar results to ours in some cases and markedly different results in others; intheir experiment, the correlations obtained with their measure that uses the hierarchy of Roget?s Thesaurusexceeded those of all the WordNet measures.26Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic RelatednessTable 2Human and computer ratings of the Miller?Charles set of word pairs.# Pair Humans relHS distJC simLC simL simR1 car automobile 3.92 200 0.0 5.08 1.00 8.622 gem jewel 3.84 200 0.0 5.08 1.00 14.383 journey voyage 3.84 150 5.2 4.08 0.74 7.714 boy lad 3.76 150 5.3 4.08 0.72 8.295 coast shore 3.70 150 0.9 4.08 0.96 11.126 asylum madhouse 3.61 150 0.2 4.08 0.99 15.707 magician wizard 3.50 200 0.0 5.08 1.00 13.588 midday noon 3.42 200 0.0 5.08 1.00 15.969 furnace stove 3.11 0 20.5 2.08 0.13 1.8510 food fruit 3.08 0 10.2 2.28 0.22 1.5011 bird cock 3.05 150 5.4 4.08 0.76 8.8812 bird crane 2.97 97 7.4 3.08 0.70 8.8813 tool implement 2.95 150 1.1 4.08 0.91 6.2014 brother monk 2.82 93 19.2 2.50 0.20 2.5315 lad brother 1.66 94 16.3 2.76 0.23 2.5316 crane implement 1.68 94 15.7 2.76 0.27 2.9017 journey car 1.16 0 16.3 1.28 0.00 0.0018 monk oracle 1.10 0 22.7 2.08 0.18 2.5319 cemetery woodland 0.95 0 25.0 1.76 0.00 0.0020 food rooster 0.89 0 17.4 1.38 0.10 0.9721 coast hill 0.87 94 10.9 2.76 0.53 6.1922 forest graveyard 0.84 0 24.6 1.76 0.00 0.0023 shore woodland 0.63 93 19.3 2.50 0.13 1.5024 monk slave 0.55 94 18.9 2.76 0.21 2.5325 coast forest 0.42 0 20.2 2.28 0.12 1.5026 lad wizard 0.42 94 16.5 2.76 0.23 2.5327 chord smile 0.13 0 20.2 1.62 0.18 2.2328 glass magician 0.11 0 22.8 1.91 0.07 0.9729 rooster voyage 0.08 0 26.9 0.91 0.00 0.0030 noon string 0.08 0 22.6 1.50 0.00 0.00Charles?s experiment with 10 subjects and found that the average correlation with theMiller?Charles mean ratings over his subjects was 0.8848.
While the difference betweenthe (absolute) values of the highest and lowest correlation coefficients in the ?M&C?column of Table 3 is of the order of 0.1, all of the coefficients compare quite favorablywith this estimate of the upper bound; furthermore, the difference diminishes almosttwofold as we consider the larger Rubenstein?Goodenough dataset (column ?R&G?
ofTable 3).10 In fact, the measures are divided in their reaction to increasing the size ofthe dataset: the correlations of relHS, simLC, and simR improve but those of distJC andsimL deteriorate.
This division might not be arbitrary: the last two depend on the samethree quantities, log p(c1), log p(c2), and log p(lso(c1, c2)) (see equations (16) and (20)).
(In fact, the coefficient for simR, which depends on only one of the three quantities,log p(lso(c1, c2)), improves only in the third digit.)
However, with the present paucity ofevidence, this connection remains hypothetical.10 None of the differences in either column are statistically significant at the .05 level.27Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 14.4.2 Differences in the Performance and Behavior of the Measures.
We now examinethe results of each of the measures and the differences between them.
To do this, we willsometimes look at differences in their behavior on individual word pairs.Looking at the graphs in Figures 2 and 3, we see that the discrete nature of theHirst?St-Onge and Leacock?Chodorow measures is much more apparent than that ofthe others: i.e., the values that they can take on are just a fixed number of levels.
This is,of course, a result of their being based on the same highly discrete factor: the path length.As a matter of fact, a more substantial correspondence between the two measures canbe recognized from the graphs and explained in the same way.
In each dataset, theupper portions of the two graphs are identical: namely, the sets of pairs affording thehighest and second-highest values of the two measures (relHS ?
150, simLC > 4).
Thishappens because these sets are composed of WordNet synonym and parent-child pairs,respectively.11Further down the Y-axis, we find that for the Miller?Charles data, the two graphsstill follow each other quite closely in the middle region (2.4?3.2 for simLC and 90?100 forrelHS).
For the larger set of Rubenstein and Goodenough?s, however, differences appear.The pair automobile?cushion (#22), for instance, is ranked even with magician?oracle (#37)by the Hirst?St-Onge measure but far below both magician?oracle (#37) and bird?crane(#42) by Leacock?Chodorow (and, in fact, by all the other measures).
The cause of sucha high ranking in the former case is the following meronymic connection in WordNet:automobile/.
.
.
/car HAS-A suspension/suspension system (?a system of springs or shockabsorbers connecting the wheels and axles to the chassis of a wheeled vehicle?
)HAS-A cushion/shock absorber/shock (?a mechanical damper; absorbs energy of suddenimpulses?
).Since relHS is the only measure that takes meronymy (and other WordNet relationsbeyond IS-A) into account, no other measure detected this connection ?
nor did the hu-man judges, whose task was to assess similarity, not generic relatedness; see Section 4.1).Finally, at the bottom portion of these two graphs, the picture becomes very dif-ferent, because relHS assigns all weakly-related pairs the value of zero.
(In fact, it is thiscut-off that we believe to be largely responsible for the relatively low ranking of thecorrelation coefficient of the Hirst?St-Onge measure.)
In contrast, two other measures,Resnik?s and Lin?s, behave quite similarly to each other in the low-similarity region.
Inparticular, their sets of zero-similarity pairs are identical, because the definitions of bothmeasures include the term log p(lso(c1, c2)), which is zero for the pairs in question.12 Forinstance, for the pair rooster?voyage (M&C #29, R&G #2), the synsets rooster and voyagehave different ?unique beginners?, and hence their lso ?
in fact their sole commonsubsumer ?
is the (fake) global root (see Section 2.5.3), which is the only conceptwhose probability is 1:cock/rooster (?adult male chicken?)

The two datasetsat hand, however, do not contain any instances from these categories.12 Again (cf.
footnote 11), the former set actually constitutes a proper subset of the latter, as simL(c1, c2)will also be zero if either concept does not occur in the frequency-corpus (see equation (20)).
However,no such instances appear in the data.28Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic RelatednessFigure 2Human and computer ratings of the Rubenstein?Goodenough set of word pairs, with sparsebands marked (see text).

IS-A global root.Looking back at the high-similarity portion of the graphs, but now taking into con-sideration the other three measures, we can make a couple more observations.
First, thegraphs of all of the measures except Resnik?s exhibit a ?line?
of synonyms (comprisingfour points for the Miller?Charles dataset and nine points for Rubenstein?Goodenough)at the top (bottom for Jiang and Conrath?s measure).
In the case of Resnik?s measure,simR(c, c) = ?
log p(lso(c, c)) = ?
log p(c) (see equation (8)), and hence the similarity ofa concept to itself varies from one concept to another.
Second, these ?lines?
are notcontinuous, as one might expect from the graphs of the human judgments: For theMiller?Charles set, for instance, the line includes pairs 1, 2, 7, and 8, but omits pairs3?6.
This peculiarity is due entirely to WordNet, according to which gem and jewel (#2)and magician and wizard (#7) are synonyms, whereas journey and voyage (#3), boy and lad(#4), and even asylum and madhouse (#6) are not, but rather are related by IS-A:voyage (?a journey to some distant place?)

).31Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1Although, as we saw above, already for two measures the details of their medium-similarity regions differ, there appears to be an interesting commonality at the level ofgeneral structure: in the vicinity of sim = 2, the plots of human similarity ratings forboth the Miller?Charles and the Rubenstein?Goodenough word pairs display a veryclear horizontal band that contains no points.
For the Miller?Charles data (Figure 3),the band separates the pair crane?implement (#16) from brother?monk (#14),13 and for theRubenstein-Goodenough set (Figure 2), it separates magician?oracle (#37) from crane?implement (#38).On the graphs of the computed ratings, these empty bands correspond to regionswith at most a few points?no more than two points for the Miller?Charles set andno more than four for the Rubenstein?Goodenough set.
These regions are shown inFigures 3(b)?
(f) and 2(b)?(f).
This commonality among the measures suggests that ifwe were to partition the set of all word pairs into those that are deemed to be relatedand those that are deemed unrelated, the boundary between the two subsets for eachmeasure (and for the human judgments, for that matter) would lie somewhere withinthese regions.4.4.3 The Limitations of this Analysis.
While comparison with human judgments is theideal way to evaluate a measure of similarity or semantic relatedness, in practice the tinyamount of data available (and only for similarity, not relatedness) is quite inadequate.But constructing a large-enough set of pairs and obtaining human judgments on themwould be a very large task.14Even more importantly, there are serious methodological problems with this ap-proach.
It was implicit in the Rubenstein?Goodenough and Miller?Charles experimentsthat subjects were to use the dominant sense of the target words or mutually triggeringrelated senses.
But often what we are really interested in is the relationship between theconcepts for which the words are merely surrogates; the human judgments that we needare of the relatedness of word-senses, not words.
So the experimental situation wouldneed to set up contexts that bias the sense selection for each target word and yet don?tbias the subject?s judgment of their a priori relationship, an almost self-contradictorysituation.155.
An Application-based Evaluation of Measures of RelatednessWe now turn to a different approach to the evaluation of similarity and relatednessmeasures that tries to overcome the problems of comparison to human judgments thatwere described in the previous section.
Here, we compare the measures through the13 For some reason, Miller and Charles, while generally ordering their pairs from least to most similar, putcrane?implement (#16) after lad?brother(#15), even though the former was rated more similar.14 Evgeniy Gabrilovich has recently made available a dataset of similarity judgments of 353 English wordpairs that were used by Finkelstein et al (2002).
Unfortunately, this set is still very small, and, as Jarmaszand Szpakowicz (2003) point out, is culturally and politically biased.
And the scarcely larger set ofsynonymy norms for nouns created by Whitten, Suter, and Frank (1979) covers only words with quiteclosely related senses, and hence is not useful here either.15 In their creation of a set of synonymy norms for nouns, Whitten, Suter, and Frank (1979) observedfrequent artifacts stemming from the order of presentation of the stimuli that seem to be due to thepractical impossibility of forcing a context of interpretation in the experimental setting.32Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic Relatednessperformance of an application that uses them: the detection and correction of real-wordspelling errors in open-class words, i.e., malapropisms.While malapropism correction is also a useful application in its own right, it isparticularly appropriate for evaluating measures of semantic relatedness.
Naturallyoccurring coherent texts, by their nature, contain many instances of related pairs ofwords (Halliday and Hasan 1976; Morris and Hirst 1991; Hoey 1991; Morris and Hirst2004).
That is, they implicitly contain human judgments of relatedness that we coulduse in the evaluation of our relatedness measures.
But, of course, we don?t know inpractice just which pairs of words in a text are and aren?t related.
We can get aroundthis problem, however, by deliberately perturbing the coherence of the text ?
that is,introduding semantic anomalies such as malapropisms ?
and looking at the ability ofthe different relatedness measures to detect and correct the perturbations.5.1 Malapropism Detection and Correction as a TestbedOur malapropism corrector (Hirst and Budanitsky 2005) is based on the idea behind thatof Hirst and St-Onge (1998): Look for semantic anomalies that can be removed by smallchanges to spelling.16 Words are (crudely) disambiguated where possible by acceptingsenses that are semantically related to possible senses of other nearby words.
If all sensesof any open-class, non?stop-list word that occurs only once in the text are found to besemantically unrelated to accepted senses of all other nearby words, but some sense ofa spelling variation of that word would be related (or is identical to another token in thecontext), then it is hypothesized that the original word is an error and the variation iswhat the writer intended; a user would be warned of this possibility.
For example, if nonearby word in a text is related to diary but one or more are related to dairy, we suggestto the user that it is the latter that was intended.

is a parameter to the algorithm, as is the precise definition of spelling variation;see Hirst and Budanitsky (2005).This method makes the following assumptions: A real-word spelling error is unlikely to be semantically related to thetext.17 Frequently, the writer?s intended word will be semantically related tonearby words. It is unlikely that an intended word that is semantically unrelated to allthose nearby will have a spelling variation that is related.While the performance of the malapropism corrector is inherently limited by theseassumptions, we can nonetheless evaluate measures of semantic relatedness by com-paring their effect on its performance, as its limitations affect all measures equally.Regardless of the degree of adequacy of its performance, it is a ?level playing field?
for16 Although it shares underlying assumptions, our algorithm differs from that of Hirst and St-Onge in itsmechanisms.
In particular, Hirst and St-Onge?s algorithm was based on lexical chains (Morris and Hirst1991), whereas our algorithm regards regions of text as bags of words.17 In fact, there is a semantic bias in human typing errors (Fromkin 1980), but not in the malapropismgenerator to be described below.33Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1comparison of the measures.
Hirst and Budanitsky (2005) discuss the practical aspectsof the method and compare it with other approaches to the same problem.5.2 MethodTo test the measures in this application, we need a sufficiently large corpus ofmalapropisms in their context, each identified and annotated with its correction.
Sinceno such corpus of naturally occurring malapropisms exists, we created one artificially.Following Hirst and St-Onge (1998), we took 500 articles from the Wall Street Journalcorpus and, after removing proper nouns and stop-list words from consideration,replaced one word in every 200 with a spelling variation, choosing always WordNetnouns with at least one spelling variation.18 For example, in a sentence beginningTo win the case, which was filed shortly after the indictment and is pending in Manhattanfederal court .
.
.
, the word case was replaced by cage.
This gave us a corpus with 1,408malapropisms among 107,233 candidates.19 We then tried to detect and correct themalapropisms by the algorithm outlined above, using in turn each of the five measuresof semantic relatedness.
For each, we used four different search scopes, i.e., window sizes:just the paragraph containing the target word (scope = 1); that paragraph plus oneor two adjacent paragraphs on each side (scope = 3 and 5); and the complete article(scope = MAX).We also needed to set a threshold of ?relatedness?
for each of the measures.
Thisis because the malapropism-detection algorithm requires a boolean related?unrelatedjudgment, but each of the measures that we tested instead returns a numerical valueof relatedness or similarity, and nothing in the measure (except for the Hirst?St-Ongemeasure) indicates which values count as ?close?.
Moreover, the values from the dif-ferent measures are incommensurate.
We therefore set the threshold of relatedness ofeach measure at the value at which it separated the higher level of the Rubenstein?Goodenough pairs (the near-synonyms) from the lower level, as we described in Sec-tion 4.4.2.5.3 ResultsMalapropism detection was viewed as a retrieval task and evaluated in terms of preci-sion, recall, and F-measure.
Observe that semantic relatedness is used at two differentplaces in the algorithm ?
to judge whether an original word of the text is related toany nearby word and to judge whether a spelling variation is related ?
and success inmalapropism detection requires success at both stages.
For the first stage, we say thata word is suspected of being a malapropism (and the word is a suspect) if it is judgedto be unrelated to other words nearby; the word is a correct suspect if it is indeed amalapropism and a false suspect if it isn?t.
At the second stage, we say that, given asuspect, an alarm is raised when a spelling variation of the suspect is judged to berelated to a nearby word or words; and if an alarm word is a malapropism, we saythat the alarm is a true alarm and that the malapropism has been detected; otherwise,it is a false alarm.
Then we can define precision (P), recall (R), and F-measure (F) for18 Articles too small to warrant such a replacement (19 in total) were excluded from further consideration.19 We assume that the original Wall Street Journal, being carefully edited text, contains essentially nomalapropisms of its own.34Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic Relatednesssuspicion (S), involving only the first stage, and detection (D), involving both stages,as follows:Suspicion:PS =number of correct suspectsnumber of suspects(21)RS =number of correct suspectsnumber of malapropisms in text(22)FS =2 ?

All the comparisons that we make below, exceptfor comparisons to baseline, are performed with the Bonferroni multiple-comparisontechnique (Agresti and Finlay 1997), with an overall significance level of .05.5.3.1 Suspicion.
We look first at the results for suspicion ?
just identifying words thathave no semantically related word nearby.
Obviously, the chance of finding some wordthat is judged to be related to the target word will increase with the size of the scope ofthe search (with a large enough scope, e.g., a complete book, we would probably finda relative for just about any word).
So we expect recall to decrease as scope increases,because some relationships will be found even for malapropisms (i.e., there will be morefalse negatives).
But we expect that precision will increase with scope, as it becomesmore likely that (genuine) relationships will be found for non-malapropisms (i.e., therewill be fewer false positives), and this factor will outweigh the decrease in the overallnumber of suspects found.Table 4 and Figure 4 show suspicion precision, recall, and F for each of the 5 ?
4combinations of measure and scope.
The values of precision range from 3.3% (Resnik,scope = 1) to 11% (Jiang?Conrath, scope = MAX), with a mean of 6.2%, increasing withscope, as expected, for all measures except Hirst?St-Onge.
More specifically, differencesin precision are statistically significant for the difference between scope = 5 and scope =MAX for Leacock?Chodorow and between 1 and larger scopes for Lin, Resnik, andJiang?Conrath; there are no significant differences for Hirst?St-Onge, which hence ap-pears flat overall.
The values of recall range from just under 6% (Hirst?St-Onge, scope =MAX) to more than 72% (Resnik, scope = 1), with a mean of 39.7%, decreasing withscope, as expected.
All differences in recall are statistically significant, except betweenscope = 3 and scope = 5 for all measures other than Resnik?s.
F ranges from 5% (Hirst?St-Onge, scope = MAX) to 14% (Jiang?Conrath, scope = 5), with a mean of just under35Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1Table 4Precision (PS), recall (RS), and F-measure (FS) for malapropism suspicion with five measures ofsemantic relatedness, varying the scope of the search for related words to 1, 3, or 5 paragraphsor the complete news article (MAX).Measure Scope PS RS FS?????????????????????

Even though values at the lower ends of these ranges appear small, they arestill significantly (p < .001) better than chance, for which precision, recall, and F areall 1.29%.
Moreover, the value for precision is inherently limited by the likelihoodthat, especially for small search scopes, there will be words other than our deliberatemalapropisms that are genuinely unrelated to all others in the scope.Because it combines recall and precision, we focused on the results for FS bymeasure and scope to determine whether the performance of the five measures wassignificantly different and whether scope of search for relatedness made a significantdifference.Scope differences.
For Jiang?Conrath and Resnik, the analysis confirms only thatthese methods perform significantly better with scope 5 than scope 1; for Lin, thatscope 3 is significantly better than scope 1; for Leacock?Chodorow, that 3 is significantlybetter than 1 and MAX better than 3; and for Hirst?St-Onge, that MAX is significantlyworse than 3.
(From the standpoint of simple detection of unrelatedness (suspicion inmalapropism detection), these data point to overall optimality of scopes 3 or 5.
)Differences between measures.
Jiang?Conrath significantly outperforms the others inall scopes (except for Leacock?Chodorow and Lin at scope MAX, where it does betterbut not significantly so), followed by Lin and Leacock?Chodorow (whose performancesare not significantly different from each other), in turn followed by Resnik.
Hirst?St-Onge, with its irregular behavior, performs close to Lin and Leacock?Chodorow forscopes 1 and 3 but falls behind as the scope size increases, finishing worst for scope MAX.36Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic RelatednessFigure 4Precision (PS), recall (RS), and F-measure (FS) for malapropism suspicion by measure and scope.37Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1Thus the Jiang?Conrath measure does best for the suspicion phase (and is optimal withscope = 5).5.3.2 Detection.
We now turn to the results for malapropism detection.
During thedetection phase, the suspects are winnowed by checking the spelling variations of eachfor relatedness to their context.
Since (true) alarms can only result from (true) suspects,recall can only decrease (or, more precisely, not increase) from that for suspicion (cf.equations (22) and (25)).
However, if a given measure of semantic relatedness is good,we expect the proportion of false alarms to reduce more considerably ?
far fewer falsesuspects will become alarms than correct suspects ?
thus resulting in higher precisionfor detection than for suspicion (cf.
Equations 21 and 24).Table 5 and Figure 5 show precision, recall, and F for each of the 5 ?
4 measure?scope combinations, determined by the same method as those for suspicion.
Thevalues of recall range from 5.9% (Hirst?St-Onge, scope = MAX) to over 60% (Leacock?Chodorow, scope = 1).
While these values are, as expected, lower than those for suspi-cion recall ?
RD for each measure?scope combination is from 1 to 16 percentage pointslower than the corresponding RS ?
the decline is statistically significant for only 3out of the 20 combinations.The values of precision range from 6.7% (Hirst?St-Onge, scope = MAX) to just under25% (Jiang?Conrath, scope = MAX), increasing, as expected, from suspicion precision;each combination increases from 1 to 14 percentage points; the increase is statisticallysignificant for 18 out of the 20 combinations.
Moreover, the increase in precision out-weighs the decline in recall, and thus F, which ranges from 6% to 25%, increases by 7.6%on average; the increase is significant for 17 out of the 20 combinations.

(See Hirst and Budanitsky (2005) fordiscussion of the practical usefulness of the method.
)Scope differences.
Our analysis of scope differences in F shows a somewhat differentpicture for detection from that for suspicion: There are significant differences betweenscopes only for the Hirst?St-Onge measure.
The F graphs of the other four methods thusare not significantly different from being flat ?
that is, scope doesn?t affect the results.
(Hence we can choose 1 as the optimal scope, since it involves the least amount of work,and Jiang and Conrath?s method with scope = 1 as the optimal parameter combinationfor the malapropism detector.
)Differences between measures.
The relative position of each measure?s precision,recall, and F graphs for detection appears identical to that for suspicion, except forthe precision and F graphs for Hirst?St-Onge, which slide further down.
Statisticaltesting for F confirms this, with Jiang?Conrath leading, followed by Lin and Leacock?Chodorow together, Resnik, and then Hirst?St-Onge.5.4 Interpretation of the ResultsIn our interpretation, we focus largely on the results for suspicion; those for detectionboth add to the pool of relatedness judgments on which we draw and corroborate whatwe observe for suspicion.The Resnik measure?s comparatively poor precision and good recall suggest that themeasure simply marks too many words as potential malapropisms?it ?under-relates?,being far too conservative in its judgments of relatedness.
For example, it was the onlymeasure that flagged crowd as a suspect in a context in which all the other measuresfound it to be related to house: crowd IS-A gathering / assemblage SUBSUMES house /household / family / menage.20 Indeed, for every scope, Resnik?s measure generates moresuspects than any other measure?e.g., an average of 62.5 per article for scope = 1,compared to a range of 15 to 47, with an average of 37, for the other measures.
TheLeacock?Chodorow measure?s superior precision and comparable recall (the formerdifference is statistically significant, the latter is not), which result in a statistically-significantly better F-value, indicate its better ability at discerning relatedness.The same comparison can be made between the Jiang?Conrath and Lin measures.Even though both use the same information-content?based components, albeit in differ-ent arithmetic combinations, and show similar recall, the Jiang?Conrath measure showssuperior precision and is best overall (see above).
The Lin and Leacock?Chodorowmeasures, in turn, have statistically indistinguishable values of F and hence similarratios of errors to true positives.Finally, the steady downward slope that distinguishes the F-graph of Hirst?St-Ongefrom those of the other four measures in Figure 4 evidently reflects the corresponding20 It is debatable whether this metonymic sense of house should appear in WordNet at all, though given thatit does, its relationship to crowd follows, and, as it happens, this sense was the correct one in the contextfor this particular case.40Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic Relatednessdifference in precision behavior: The Hirst?St-Onge suspicion precision graph is statis-tically flat, unlike the others.
Ironically, given that this measure is the only one of thefive that promises the semantic relatedness that we want rather than mere similarity,this poor performance appears to be a result of the measure?s ?over-relating?
?
it isfar too promiscuous in its judgments of relatedness.
For example, it was the onlymeasure that considered cation (a malapropism for nation) to be related to group:cation IS-A ion IS-A atom PART-OF molecule HAS-A group / radical (?two or more atomsbound together as a single unit and forming part of a molecule?).
Because of itspromiscuity, the Hirst?St-Onge measure?s mean number of suspects for scope = 1 is15.07, well below the average, and moreover it drops to one-ninth of that, 1.75, atscope = MAX; the number of articles without a single suspect grows from 1 to 93.
Bycomparison, for the other measures, the number of suspects drops only to around athird or a quarter from scope = 1 to scope = MAX, and the number of articles with nosuspect stays at 1 for both Leacock?Chodorow and Resnik and increases only from 1 to4 for Lin and from 1 to 12 for Jiang?Conrath.6.
Related Work6.1 Other Applications of WordNet-based MeasuresSince the first publication of the initial results of this work (Budanitsky and Hirst 2001),Pedersen and his colleagues (Pedersen, Patwardhan, and Michelizzi 2004) have madeavailable a Perl implementation of the five WordNet-based measures (plus Wu andPalmer?s and their own; see below) that has been used by a number of researchers inpublished work on other NLP applications.
Generally, these results are consistent withour own.
For example, Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) found Jiang?Conrath to be thebest measure (out of ?several?, which they do not list) for their task of pattern inductionfor information extraction.
Similarly, Kohomban and Lee (2005) found Jiang?Conraththe best (out of ?various schemes?, which they do not list) for their task of learningcoarse-grained semantic classes.
In word-sense disambiguation, Patwardhan, Banerjee,and Pedersen (2003) found Jiang?Conrath to be clearly the best of the five measuresevaluated here, albeit edged out by their own new ?Lesk?
measure based on glossoverlaps;21 and McCarthy et al (2004) found that the Jiang?Conrath and Lesk measuresgave the best accuracy in their task of finding predominant word senses, with the resultsof the two being ?comparable?
but Jiang?Conrath being far more efficient.
On the otherhand, Corley and Mihalcea (2005) found little difference between the measures whenusing them in an algorithm for computing text similarity.6.2 Measures of Distributional Similarity as Proxies for Measuresof Semantic RelatednessIn Section 1.1, we mentioned that the lexical semantic relatedness or similarity thatwe have dealt with in this paper is a notion distinct from that of lexical distributional21 Patwardhan et al?s measure is based on the idea, originally due to Lesk (1986), of measuring the degreeof relatedness of two words by the number of string overlaps in their dictionary definitions or glosses.Patwardhan et al extend this idea by also including overlaps with definitions of words that are oneWordNet edge away from the comparison words.
It is thus a hybrid method, with characteristics ofboth dictionary-based and network-based methods (see Sections 2.1 and 2.3 above).41Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1or co-occurrence similarity.
However, a number of researchers, such as Dagan (2000),have promoted the hypothesis that distributional similarity can act as a useful proxyfor semantic relatedness in many applications because it is based on corpus-deriveddata rather than manually created lexical resources; indeed, it could perhaps be usedto automatically create (first-draft) lexical resources (Grefenstette 1994).
It is thereforenatural to ask how distributional-similarity measures compare with the WordNet-basedmeasures that we have looked at above.Formally, by distributional similarity (or co-occurrence similarity) of two wordsw1 and w2, we mean that they tend to occur in similar contexts, for some definition ofcontext; or that the set of words that w1 tends to co-occur with is similar to the set thatw2 tends to co-occur with; or that if w1 is substituted for w2 in a context, its ?plausibility?
(Weeds 2003; Weeds and Weir 2005) is unchanged.
The context considered may be asmall or large window around the word, or an entire document; or it may be a syntacticrelationship.
For example, Weeds (2003; Weeds and Weir, 2005) (see below) took verbsas contexts for nouns in object position: so they regarded two nouns to be similar tothe extent that they occur as direct objects of the same set of verbs.
Lin (1998b, 1998a)considered other syntactic relationships as well, such as subject?verb and modifier?noun, and looked at both roles in the relationship.Given this framework, many different methods of measuring distributional similar-ity have been proposed; see Dagan (2000), Weeds (2003), or Mohammad and Hirst (2005)for a review.
For example, the set of words that co-occur with w1 and those that co-occurwith w2 may be regarded as a feature vector of each and their similarity measured asthe cosine between the vectors; or a measure may be based on the Kullback?Leibler di-vergence between the probability distributions P(w |w1) and P(w |w2), as, for example,Lee?s (1999) ?-skew divergence.
Lin (1998b) uses his similarity theorem (equation (19)above) to derive a measure based on the degree of overlap of the sets of words withwhich w1 and w2, respectively, have positive mutual information.22Words that are distributionally similar do indeed often represent semantically re-lated concepts, and vice versa, as the following examples demonstrate.
Weeds (2003),in her study of 15 distributional-similarity measures, found that words distributionallysimilar to hope (noun) included confidence, dream, feeling, and desire; Lin (1998b) foundpairs such as earnings?profit, biggest?largest, nylon?silk, and pill?tablet.
It is intuitivelyclear why these results occur: if two concepts are similar or related, it is likely thattheir role in the world will be similar, so similar things will be said about them, and sothe contexts of occurrence of the corresponding words will be similar.
And conversely(albeit with less certainty), if the contexts of occurrence of two words are similar, thensimilar things are being said about each, so they are playing similar roles in the worldand hence are semantically similar ?
at least to the extent of these roles.
Nonetheless,the limitations of this observation will become clear in our discussion below.Three differences between semantic relatedness and distributional similarity areimmediately apparent.
First, while semantic relatedness is inherently a relation on con-cepts, as we emphasized in Section 1.1, distributional similarity is a (corpus-dependent)relation on words.
In theory, of course, if one had a large-enough sense-tagged corpus,one could derive distributional similarities of word-senses.
But in practice, apart fromthe lack of such corpora, distributional similarities are promoted exactly for applications22 Do not confound Lin?s distributional similarity measure with his semantic relatedness measure, simL,which has been discussed in earlier sections of this paper; but observe that both are derived from thesame theorem.42Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic Relatednesssuch as various kinds of ambiguity resolution in which it is words rather than sensesthat are available (see Weeds (2003) for an extensive list).Second, whereas semantic relatedness is symmetric, distributional similarity is apotentially asymmetrical relationship.
If distributional similarity is conceived of assubstitutability, as Weeds and Weir (2005) and Lee (1999) emphasize, then asymme-tries arise when one word appears in a subset of the contexts in which the otherappears; for example, the adjectives that typically modify apple are a subset of those thatmodify fruit, so fruit substitutes for apple better than apple substitutes for fruit.
Whilesome distributional similarity measures, such as cosine, are symmetric, many, such as?-skew divergence and the co-occurrence retrieval models developed by Weeds andWeir, are not.
But this is simply not an adequate model of semantic relatedness, forwhich substitutability is far too strict a requirement: window and house are semanticallyrelated, but they are not plausibly substitutable in most contexts.Third, lexical semantic relatedness depends on a pre-defined lexicographic or otherknowledge resource, whereas distributional similarity is relative to a corpus.
In eachcase, matching the measures to the resource is a research problem in itself, as thispaper and Weeds (2003) show, and anomalies can arise.23 But the knowledge sourcefor semantic relatedness is created by humans and may be presumed to be (in a weaksense) ?true, unbiased, and complete?.
A corpus, on the other hand, is not.
Imbalancein the corpus and data sparseness is an additional source of anomalous results evenfor ?good?
measures.
For example, Lin (1998b) found ?peculiar?
similarities that were?reasonable?
for his corpus of news articles, such as captive?westerner (because in thenews articles, more than half of the ?westerners?
mentioned were being held captive)and audition?rite (because both were infrequent and were modified by uninhibited).We now turn to the hypothesis that distributional similarity can usefully stand in forsemantic relatedness in NLP applications such as malapropism detection.
Weeds (2003)considered the hypothesis in detail.
She carried out a number of experiments using datagathered from the British National Corpus on the distribution of a set of 2000 nounswith respect to the verbs of which they were direct objects, comparing a large numberof proposed measures of distributional similarity.
She applied ten of these measures tothe Miller and Charles word-pairs (see Section 4.1 above); the absolute values of thecorrelations with the Miller and Charles human judgments was at best .62 (and at worst.26), compared with .74 to .85 for the semantic measures (Table 3 above).
Weeds alsocompared these measures on their ability to predict the k words that are semanticallyclosest to a target word in WordNet, as measured by Lin?s semantic similarity measure,simL.
She found performance to be ?generally fairly poor?
(page 162), and underminedby the effects of varying word frequencies.Last, Weeds experimented with distributional measures in real-word spelling cor-rection, much as we have defined it in Hirst and Budanitsky (2005) and in Section 5.1above, but replacing the semantic relatedness measures with distributional similaritymeasures.
However, she varied the experimental procedure in a number of ways, withthe consequence that her results are not directly comparable to ours: her test data wasthe British National Corpus; scope was measured in words, not paragraphs; and relat-edness thresholds were replaced by considering the k words most similar to the targetword (and k was a parameter).
The most significant difference, however, arose from the23 We have already remarked in Section 5.4 above on the promiscuity of the Hirst?St-Onge measureand its tendency to find connections such as cation?group.
Similarly, one of the poorer measures thatWeeds experimented with returned this list as the ten words most distributionally similar to hope:hem, dissatisfaction, dismay, scepticism, concern, outrage, break, warrior, optimism, readiness.43Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1limitations due to data sparseness that are inherent in methods based on distributionalsimilarity: the very small size of the set of words that could be corrected.
Specifically,only malapropisms for which both the error and the correction occurred in the set of2,000 words for which Weeds had distributional data could be considered; and the abil-ity to detect and correct the malapropism depended on other members of that set alobeing within the scope of the target word.
It is therefore not surprising that the resultswere generally poor (and so were results for simL run under the same conditions).
Thissevere limitation on the data means that this was not really a fair test of the principlesunderlying the hypothesis; a fair test would require data allowing the comparison ofany two nouns (or better still, any two words) in WordNet, but obtaining such data forless-frequent words (possibly using the Web as the corpus) would be a massive task.7.
ConclusionOur goal in this paper has been to evaluate resource-based measures of lexical semanticdistance, or, equivalently, semantic relatedness, for use in natural language processingapplications.
Most of the work, however, was limited to the narrower notion of mea-sures of similarity and how well they fill the broader role, because those measures arewhat current resources support best and hence what most current research has focusedon.
But ultimately it is the more-general idea of relatedness, not just similarity, that weneed for most NLP methods and applications, because the goal, in one form or another,is to determine whether two smaller or larger pieces of text share a topic or some kindof closeness in meaning, and this need not depend on the presence of words that denotesimilar concepts.
In word sense disambiguation, such an association with the contextis frequently a sufficient basis for selecting or rejecting candidate senses (Banerjeeand Pedersen 2003); in our malapropism corrector, a word should be considered non-anomalous in the context of another if there is any kind of semantic relationship at allapparent between them.
These relationships include not just hyponymy and the non-hyponymy relationships in WordNet such as meronymy but also associative and ad hocrelationships.
As mentioned in the introduction, these can include just about any kindof functional relation or frequent association in the world.24For the last century, many researchers have attempted to enumerate these kindsof relationships.
Some elements from a typical list (that of Spellman, Holyoak, andMorrison (2001)) are shown in Table 6.
Morris and Hirst (2004, 2005) have termed thesenon-classical lexical semantic relationships (following Lakoff?s (1987) non-classical cat-egories), and Morris has shown in experiments with human subjects that around 60%of the lexical relationships that readers perceive in a text are of this nature (Morris2006).
There is presently no catalogue of instances of these kinds of relationships letalone any incorporation of such relationships into a quantification of semantic distance.Nonetheless, there are clear intuitions to be captured here, and this should be a focusfor future research.But lists of such relationships can never be exhaustive, as lexical relationships canalso arise ad hoc in context (Barsalou 1983, 1989) ?
in particular, as co-membershipof an ad hoc category.
For example, Morris?s subjects reported that the words sex,drinking, and drag racing were semantically related, by all being ?dangerous behaviors?,in the context of an article about teenagers emulating what they see in movies.
Thus24 Don?t confound ?frequent association in the world?
with the lexical co-occurrences that underlie thedistributional similarity of Section 6.2.44Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic RelatednessTable 6From Spellman, Holyoak, and Morrison?s (2001) list of associative semantic relations.Name Example???????????????
?IS-USED-TO bed?sleepWORKS-IN judge?courtLIVES-IN camel?desertIS-THE-OUTSIDE-OF husk?cornlexical semantic relatedness is sometimes constructed in context and cannot always bedetermined purely from an a priori lexical resource such as WordNet.25 It?s very unclearhow ad hoc semantic relationships could be quantified in any meaningful way, let alnecompared with prior quantifications of the classical and non-classical relationships.However, ad hoc relationships accounted for only a small fraction of those reportedby Morris?s subjects (Morris 2006).
The fact of their existence does not underminethe usefulness of computational methods for quantifying semantic distances for non?ad hoc relationships, and the continued development of such methods is an importantdirection for research.AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported financially bythe Natural Sciences and Research Council ofCanada, the Ontario Graduate ScholarshipProgram, and the University of Toronto.
