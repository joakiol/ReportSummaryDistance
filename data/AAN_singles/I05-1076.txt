This paper discusses verb information items in the grammaticalknowledge dictionary of Tibetan language.
The verb information items includemorphology, word-formation and syntax, in which the core is the verbclassification with syntactic and semantic features.
So the influences on clausestructures of 12 types of verbs have been discussed.
Also the paper designs aninformation table to compile the verb items and their related knowledge, inwhich most of the details of verbs have been described.
At last some newly-found phenomena have been discussed and the paper therefore proposes thatthere are still some special tokens or constructs need to be mined out in Tibetan.1   The Background of Constructing a Grammatical KnowledgeDictionarySegmentation is one of the important tasks of text-processing in Tibetan.
In order togain satisfactory results we have proposed a suggestion, in which most of chunks canbe identified with markers of chunks, and words can be segmented within chunks.Although the proposal achieved well in our sample of small scale data,[1] yet thewrong match and ambiguous phenomenon still obstruct our future work in the realtexts.
The reasons, we think, are in two aspects.
One is lack of a perfect Tibetangrammatical system which is now still not constructed for information processing.Another is deficient in useful resources, especially a Tibetan knowledge dictionary ofhigh quality with morphological and syntactic information.A grammatical knowledge dictionary means a base with some essentialinformation of the morphological and syntactic grammar, including pragmatic andrhetorical information as well.
With such a dictionary, most phenomenon of mistakenword matching and recognizing, to some extent, may perhaps be eliminated duringthe word-segmenting.
As to Tibetan, there are three main types of lexical information.Firstly, the lexical item itself is a kind of grammatical functional markers, such as, thegenitive markers; secondly, the lexical item serves as a formal marker of somegrammatical sections, such as, in sku gdung ?Buddha?s bone?, ?sku?
acted as theprefix morpheme of the honorific words can construct amounts of honorificvocabulary;[2] last, the grammatical function of words may be ascertained after beinganalyzed, such as the verb yid ches byed ?trust?
belongs to the cognition verbs, whichThe Verbal Entries and Their Description in a Grammatical Information-Dictionary 875specify case markers for their subjects and objects.
Nevertheless, no matter whichinformation types, they all need previously be tagged as information attributives in agrammatical knowledge dictionary.It should be pointed out, all the above information of lexical types may regard asthe principle to construct a grammar knowledge dictionary.
No matter how widely anitem is used or how many its function includes, each item is equal in information.That is to say, equal attention should be paid to every lexical item with filling itsinformation contents in every field of the dictionary, no matter much or fewphenomenon of items involve.Finally, the source of information attributives of Tibetan grammatical dictionaryshould be mentioned.
Generally speaking, all the information of lexical items stemfrom language material or real texts.
But the information contents and informationattributives of each lexical item should be ascertained through the Tibetangrammatical system.
So, we will take verbs as examples and discuss informationcontents of lexical items in our Tibetan grammatical system, which we call GIDCT (aGrammatical Information-Dictionary of Contemporary Tibetan).2   Grammatical Features of VerbsThe most important features of Tibetan verbs embodied three dimensions, themorphology, word-formation and syntax.
These three dimensions influence each otherand condition each other.
So the relationship and the forms of grammaticalrepresentation among them need to be ascertained gradually.2.1   Morphological FeaturesThe morphological features only refer to the forms of tense and mood remained fromthe ancient original forms of Tibetan monosyllabic verbs.
That is to say, eachmonosyllabic verb may have four forms, the present tense form (also named proto-form), future tense form, past tense form and imperative mood form.
However, theparadigm of Tibetan monosyllabic verbs, by no means, only adds the affixes orexhibits the regular inflection to construct.
From the following examples, we canclearly comprehend the morphological conception of Tibetan verbs in table 1.Obviously, the paradigm is of irregularity, as is the irregular change of verbs inEnglish.
It is quite difficult to analogize for this reason.
But on the other hand, thereare amount of Tibetan verbs which never change their forms.
Related with the syntax,those sentences with prospective aspect markers always use the future tense forms ofverbs, and sentences with realis markers always use past tense forms.
That meansmorphology and syntax restrictively interacts each others.
In addition, according toH.A.J?schke?s views[3], the present and the future forms always appear together withthe negative particle ?mi?, and the past and imperative forms with negative particle?ma?, which also have influences on the orders words.
From the above, we know thatthe morphological features of Tibetan monosyllabic verbs still remain somerestrictions on the syntactic function in the contemporary Tibetan, though Tibetanverbal morphemes are the remains of ancient times.876 D. Jiang, C. Long, and J. ZhangTable 1.

Tibetan polysyllabicverbs have stronger regularity in word-formation.
They consist of nouns and verbs oradjectives and verbs.
Among them, most of the verbal morphemes in compounds arecommon verbs without substantive sense.
Please observer the following words intable 2.Table 2.

Because of the productivity ofcompound verbs, dictionaries always fall behind.
So it is possible to resolve theproblem of recognition of verbs if verbal morphemes be regarded as morphologicalmarkers and rules of compound word-formation be built up in compounds.Taking ngal gso rgyag ?relax?
as an example, it is always viewed as a phrase, sothe compound word and the likes can not enter into A Tibetan-Chinese Dictionary[4].In this case, the segmentation of the word may be ngal-gso/ rgyag with the dictionary,in which the former is a noun with meaning ?relaxation?, the latter is a monosyllabicverb with not-thorough-going meaning ?doing, making?.
The real reason led to such agrammatical conception is that many compound verbs can be inserted some othergrammatical constituents, such as ngal-gso yag-po rgyag ?take a good rest?, ngal-gsotog-tsham rgyag ?take a short break?.
In our opinion, Tibetan polysyllabic compoundverbs are still in progress and not yet fall into a pattern in mind.
Anyway, whenThe Verbal Entries and Their Description in a Grammatical Information-Dictionary 877engaged in computer processing, we can not give up an undertaking on account of asmall obstacle.
So while we put compound verbs in the dictionary we make someother rules to process the verbal phrases with inserted constituents.Quite few are another type of common disyllabic compound verbs in Tibetan,which are non-productive in word-formation.
For instance, ha go ?understand?, khanor ?make an indiscreet remark?, ngo tsha ?be shy?, blo?gel ?trust in?, khas?che?promise?, ha las ?amaze?, ya mtshan ?be strange at?.
Those words were formedfrom phrases in history and are unmarked forms.
So we can put them all into thedictionary directly without morphological analysis.2.3   Syntactic FeaturesThe Tibetan verb syntactic features cover many categories.
Such as, whether or notthey take objects, what kind of objects they take, which types of case markers theyrequire to subject and object constituents, and so on.
On the other hand, Theattributions of verbs themselves are very important, which determine the quantity ofarguments and the frame of sentences, such as attribution of human verbs, of volitionverbs, of controllable verbs, causative verbs, and so on.
In addition, some othersyntactic features are also of importance.
e.g.
the formal markers of normalization foreach verb, and the position relationships between verbs and adverbial modifiers andso on.In our project, an effective way to analysis Tibetan verb syntax has been foundthat is classification for verbs according to the types of syntactic features andsemantic features of verbs.
With this method we can describe those grammaticalinformation for each verb and compile verbs into the knowledge dictionary indifferent types.
The following are some description of 12 types of verbs.
[5]Verbs of possession: This type of verbs indicates those which contain themeaning ?to possess, to gain, to come being to, to form?
and so on.
For example, yod/dug ?have?, vthob ?gain?, byung/ yong ?take place?, rag ?obtain?, ?dzams ?belongto?, ?chor/ shor ?appear, emerge?
and so on.
The basic format of verbs of possessionis ?NP+[POS]+NP+V(VOP), which requires that the subjects take possessive casemarkers, and that the objects take absolutive case marker (zero form).
So the syntacticinformation items of verbs of possession are like these {V(VOP), NP(S)+POS,NP(O)+?}.
Also, most of the verbs of possession possess the characteristic of{HMN}(subjects are human being).Existential verb: This type of verbs expresses the meaning of someone orsomething being somewhere.
For instance, yod/ ?dug/ yog red ?exist, be?.
Existentialverbs demand the subjects take absolutive case marker, and the objects take locativecase marker.
The basic syntactic format of existential verbs is ?NP+NP+[LOC]+VP(EXI)?.
Existential verbs and verbs of possession do not obligatorily demand thecharacteristics of {HMN} and {CTR}(subjects can control actions) for subjects.
Thegrammatical information items of existential verbs include {V(EXI), NP+LOC}.Verbs of change: The verbs of change indicate those which take resultantcomplement constituents.
Such as sprul ?change?, sgyur ?make to change?, ?gyur?turn to?, ?gro ?change?, ?dul ?domesticate?
and so on.
The basic format of the verbsof change is ?NP+VP(adj/ v)+[COP]+VP(CHA)?.
That means verbs of change requirecomplements of adjectives or verbal phrases which express the results of verb878 D. Jiang, C. Long, and J. Zhangchanges and there is a complement particle between complement constituents(COP)and verbs.
So in the information dictionary, the characteristics of {V(CHA), VP+COP}should be described.Perception verbs: This type of verbs indicates responses and feelings humanbeing perceives from things or events by sight, by hearing and by aesthesia.
Such as,mthong ?see?, go ?hear?, ha go ?understand?, dran ?remember?, brjed ?forget?, ngoshes ?recognize?
and so on.
Perception verbs possess the characteristic of {HMN}and {INV}(non-volition).
Except of a few words such as brjed ?forget?, the actionoutcome of the perception verbs can not be controlled by human being withconsciousness.
So they are non-controllable verbs.
The basic format of the perceptionverbs is ?NP+[AG]+NP+VP(PER)?.
That means the subject may take an agentive casemarker.
So the information items in the dictionary are {V(PER), NP(S)+AG, HMN,UCT(=non-control)}, but the information items for verbs like brjed ?forget?
are{V(PER), NP(S)+AG, HMN, CTR}.Directional verbs: This type of verbs indicates those which express movingaction concepts or staying status concepts.
The common verbs are ?gro ?go?, phyin?go?, yong ?come?, phebs ?come?, bsdad ?stay?, bzhag ?lay up?
and so on.
Thedirectional verbs can construct directional-predicate structure: ?NP+VP(DIR)?, orconstruct directional complement: NP+VP+VP(DIR), in which the verbs are calleddirectional constituents, or construct serial verbal phrases: NP+VP+[TAP]+VP(DIR).The information items of directional verbs in the dictionary are {V(DIR), VP+V(DIR),VP+TAP+VP(DIR)}.
There are no obligatory demands on the characteristics of{HMN}, {CTR}, or {VOL} for subjects in directional verb structures.Cognition verbs: This type of verbs indicates those which express non-actionpsychological activity.
The common verbs are brtsi ?jog byed ?respect?, dga?
zhenbyed ?like?, ngo tsha ?be shy?, sems shor ?be infatuated with?, mthong tchung byed?belitter?, ngo rgol byed ?be object to?, dogs ?be suspicious of?
and so on.
The basicsyntactic structure of the cognition verbs is NP+[AG]+NP +[OBJ]+VP(COG), namelythe subjects can take agentive case markers, and objects can take objective casemarkers.
The information items of cognition verbs is {V(COG), NP(S)+AG, NP(O)+OBJ}in the dictionary.Narrate verbs: The narrate verbs indicate the verbs expressing the meaning ofcitation and thinking in mind.
Such as bshad ?say?, zer ?speak?, ?dri ?ask?, lan slog?answer?, bsam ?think?, dgongs ?think over?, shes ?know?
and so on.
The narrateverbs require clausal objects or objects of normalization phrases, the basic structuresare ?NP+[AG]+[NP+VP]+VP(NAR), or [NP+VP] +NP +[AG]+VP(NAR), in which theclausal objects of citation verbs unusually attaches clause particle ?se?.
Theinformation items of narrate verbs in the dictionary include {V(NAR)}.Interrelation verbs: This type of verbs indicates those which interconnect two ormore things or events on logic, or social rules, or common senses, which correspondor subordinate each other.
For instance, ?dre ?mix up?, ?gal ?violate?, mthun ?be inconsensus?, kha bral ?separate?, stun ?fit?, kha thug rgyag ?meet?.
The syntacticformat of the interrelation verbs is NP+NP+[ITP]+VP(REL), namely the interrelationverbs need attach an interrelation case marker ?dang?
to the nouns related.
Thereforethe information items of interrelation verbs should include {V(REL), NP+ITP}.Causative verbs: The causative verbs include the meaning of ?cause to do?, suchas bcug ?let to do?, byed ?let to do, make sth.
appear?, bzo ?make sb.
do?
and so on.The Verbal Entries and Their Description in a Grammatical Information-Dictionary 879Generally, the subjects of causative verbs attach agentive case marker to subjects, andsometimes possessive case marker to subjects in object-clause.
Usually, there is acausative particle ?ru?
between the object-clause and the causative verbs.
The basicsyntactic structure of causative verbs are ?NP+[AG]+NP+[POS]+(NP+)VP+[CAU]+VP(CAV)?.
The information items of causative verbs in the dictionary are{V(CAV), NP(S)+AG, NP(PCC)+POS, PCC+CAV}.Stative verbs: This type of verbs indicates those which express the state ofactions.
Such as shi ?die?, bzi ?drunk?, snyun ?be ill?, yal ?disappear?
and so on.
Thebasic syntactic structure of the stative verbs is ?NP+?
NP+?
VP(STA)?, namely thesubject and object should be with absolutive case marker.
The information items ofthe stative verbs in the dictionary are {V(STA)}.Action verbs: Action verbs include several types.
Some express the meaning ofrendering and take two objects, some express the meaning of objects changing andtake a result object.
The objects?
types of action verbs include accusative objects,indirect objects, resultative objects.
The subject of action verbs are often attached anagentive case marker.
Action verbs can be divided into transitive and intransitiveverbs.
The basic syntactic structure of intransitive action verb is ?NP+VP(ACT)?, andthat of transitive is ?NP+NP+VP(ACT)?, or that of bi-objects is ?NP+NP+[DAT]+NP+VP?, or that of resultative objects is ?NP+[AG]+NP+NP+[FAT]+VP(ACT)?.Copula: Copula denotes verbs yin / red ?be?
which express the classes ofgrammatical subjects.
The basic structure of copula is ?NP+NP+VP(COU)?, namelyboth of the subject and the object use absolutive case marker.
[6]As space is limited, the above description about verbal syntax and semantics isquite simple.
We believe more and more grammatical information phenomena will bemined out and be collected into grammatical information dictionary one by one in ourfuture work.3   Descriptions of the Information Items Related to Verbs andSome SamplesIn this section, we will describe the information items of verbs which are in ourGIDCT.
For the sake of a clear statement, we will illustrate some representativesamples as well.<Number>, it denotes the order location of a word entry in GIDCT.<Word form>, it denotes Tibetan characters (orthography) of written words, e.g.<Transliteration of Word Form>, it denotes transliteration forms of Tibetanwords with roman letters according to a scheme designed.
E.g.
rlung langs.<Lhasa pronunciation>, it denotes the phonetic transcription of words accordingto Lhasa pronunciation.
E.g.
lungf langw or lu?55 la?132.<Meaning(Chinese)>, it denotes the basic meaning of entries with Chinese or otherlanguages, this sample is ?anger, rage?.<Homograph>, it denotes the homographs of entries, namely dividing apolysemous word into different words, then giving their other meanings here.E.g.
?blow?.880 D. Jiang, C. Long, and J. Zhang<Variant>, it provides a different entry forms in spelling.
There is no variant forthis sample.<Syllabic Numbers of Entries>, There are about 1300 monosyllabic verbs, andabout 100 disyllabic verbs in Tibetan, which are classic forms.
A number of modernTibetan verbs are polysyllable with a noun and a monosyllabic verb, which shows thevalue and importance of the syllabic numbers in computer processing.
This sample isa two syllabic verb.<Types of word-formation>, it let choose one item from the four: mono-morphemic words, non-productive compounds, productive compounds, reduplicativecompounds.
Mono-morphemic verbs are monosyllabic verbs; non-productivecompound verbs are classic disyllables, both of which are unmarked.
Compoundverbs are polysyllabic verbs with verbs serving as markers.
Reduplicative compoundverbs are too complicated, which have been discussed in another paper.
[7] For thissample, word-formation type is a non-productive compound.<Word-formation structure>, it let choose one from types of subject-predicate,predicate-object (verb-object), modifier-head, complement-verb, and co-ordinationconstituents.
Different structures of word-formation of compound verbs have effectson syntactic structures in processing, as in the case of compound verbs withaccusative objects.
In the format of ?noun +noun+ (monosyllabic)verb?
(namely:N1+N2+V), the ?N1?
may be an object of compound verb ?N2+V?, or a part of thecompound verb.
On the other, the difference of the inner structure of compound verbsmay cause different object types.
Such as, the subject-predicate compound verbsusually require accusative objects with zero marker, and verbs of predicate-objecttype generally require objective objects with objective marker.
Therefore, the innerstructural relationship of compound verbs may produce influence on the objects andtheir types.
[8] This sample is a non-productive compound verb.<Word-formation productivity>, it denotes the ability of monosyllabic verbsserving as verbal morpheme in word-formation.
The chosen items are strong one,weak one, and null.
E.g., classic disyllabic compound verbs possess no capability ofcombining new-type compound verbs, which are null.
The sample is null.<Classic Tense form>, it denotes the forms of classic monosyllabic verbs, someof which show different forms survived from old time.
One of the four forms can bechosen from present form, past form, future form, and imperative form.
The sample ispresent form.<Formative structure>, it denotes the reduplicative form of verbs only.
Thesample is not reduplicative form.<Root>, it let write down directly the transliteration forms of verb root or stem.The sample is ?rlung?.<Meaning of verb root 1>, it let write down directly the meaning in Chinese orother language.
The sample is ?air, wind?.<Meaning of verb root 2>, it let write down directly the meaning in Chinese orother language.
The sample is null.<Word-formation or formative morpheme>, it let write down the transliterationform of word-formation morpheme.
The sample is ?langs?.<Meaning of word-formation or formative morpheme>, it let write down themeaning of the word-formation or formative morpheme.
The sample is ?happen?.The Verbal Entries and Their Description in a Grammatical Information-Dictionary 881<Honorific form>, it let write down the honorific forms of some verbs.
Thesample is null.<Parts of Speech>, it defines parts of speech of every verb entry, in which thereare two main types: transitive and intransitive.
The sample is transitive one.<Verbal Types of syntax and semantics>, it defines the syntactic and semantictypes of verbs, and choose one from following: stative verb, action verb, cognitionverb, perception verb, verb of change, directional verb, narrate verb, copula, verb ofpossession, existential verb, interrelation verb, causative verb.
The sample iscognition verb.<Person>, it denotes the agreement between person and copula verbs orexistential verbs.
The sample is null.<HMN/UMN>, it denotes whether a verb is a human verb or not.
The sample isHMN.<CTR/NTR>, it denotes whether a verb is a controllable verb or not.
The sampleis CTR.<VOL/NOL>, it denotes whether a verb is a volitional verb or non-volitionalverb.
The sample is volitional verb.<CAV/NAV>, it denotes whether a verb is a causative or non-causative verb.The sample is NAV.<Subject case type>, it denotes what type of case markers the verb requires for asubject (including absolutive /agentive/ possessive).
The sample is agentive (AG).<Object case type>, it denotes what type of case markers the verb requires forobject (including accusative / objective / resultative).
The sample is objective one.<Indirect object case type>, it denotes what type of case markers the verbrequires for indirect objects.
The sample is null.<Cases for noun phrases>, it denotes what type of case markers the verbdemands for specific noun phrases (including locative, ablative, allative, instrumental,comparative, exclusive, genitive, factitive and so on).<Argument value>, it denotes the quantity of arguments the verb refers to.
Thesample is 2.<Negative form and the position>, it let choose one from the two negative forms(mi, ma), and ascertain the distributing position in verb phrases, before verbs, orfollowing verbs, or between syllables of verbs.
The sample is between two syllables.<Normalization marker>, it let write down the form of normalization markers ofthe verb.
The sample is ?mkhan, dus?.As to the examples, it is better to collect one or more phrases or clauses asexamples from real texts, which can illustrate morphological or syntacticphenomenon.<Example>, sku rlung ma gnang          ?Don?t be angry.?
(honorific)pha-ma-s    nga-r     rlung-langs-song.
?My parents are angry with me.

Although the data bulk is still not large,some special problems of data has appeared which are somewhat difficult to enterGIDCT base.
For instance, ngal rtsol byed gi yod mdog mdog byed ?to pretend towork?, in which mdog originally means ?color?, after being reduplicated, it means?false appearance?.
But it can not be used alone, it is the same with the verb form ofmdog mdog byed which is constructed by reduplicating form plus verb form.
And itsobject is always a clause (e.g.
grwa pa yin mdog mdog byed ?pretend to be a lama?
)or a verb phrase (e.g.
mi shes pa shes mdog mdog byed ?pretend to know when onedoes not know?).
There is not any markers between the verb and clause-objects orverb-phrase-objects.
Obviously, when processing this kind of forms, we should addsome new information items of morphology to the dictionary, such as verbal boundforms or non-absolute verb phrase structures.
In addition, some scattered phenomenoncan not be overlooked, because as information items of the dictionary, they are of thesame value.Professor Yu Shiwen has made very careful annotation for Chinese word items inThe Grammatical Knowledge-base of Contemporary Chinese.
[9] By contrast, GIDCTis impossible to reach such depth for the time being.
There are many reasons, but theessential one is still lack of extensive and thorough researches on grammaticalinfrastructures.
On the other hand, Tibetan language information processing is quitedifferent from Chinese, it is not suitable to make a dictionary by copying thedescription method of Chinese grammar simply.
Take Chinese resultative verbs for anexample, this type of verbs always extend to syntactic resultative phrases, such as ??
(remember-fixed) ?remember?
to ?
?
?
(remember-able-fixed) ?able toremember?.
Yet the type of verbs only contains some of Chinese verbs, so it is worthto list their information in the dictionary.
For Tibetan polysyllabic compound verbs,nearly all of them can accept modifiers or complements between nominal and verbalmorphemes, it is difficult to compile them or describe them in the dictionary.In true texts, there are close connection among verbs and other constituents,especially predicate endings, including aspect markers, evidential markers and moodmarkers.
But these information may list separately in GIDCT, which is quite differentfrom Yu?s GKBCC, in which Chinese ?
?zhuo, ?le, ?guo?
are listed as verbs?information items.
[10] Also, some other information, such as information of verbs884 D. Jiang, C. Long, and J. Zhangmodified by adverbs and of the relations with auxiliary verbs, etc, have not yet beendescribed in GIDCT temporarily.
All in all, it will be an important task to mineinformation as much as possible in Tibetan grammatical information dictionaryconstruction.Now the infrastructure of languages and construction of electronic dictionarieshas been attached more and more great importance to, including classifying syntaxdictionary and semantic dictionary.
[11][12] The GIDCT is also a good beginning toTibetan natural language processing.AcknowledgementThis research is supported by NSFC of China.
