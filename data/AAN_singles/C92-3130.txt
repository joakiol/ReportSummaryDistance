jpAbstractThis paperdescribes the framework for a new ab-straction method that utilizes event-tmits writtenin sentences.
Event-units are expressed in Lan-guage Information Structnrc (LIS) form and theprojection of LIS from a sentence is f)cffonnedby a semantic engine.
ABEX (ABstraction EX-traction system) utilizes the LIS outpttt of thesemant ic  eng ine .
ABI ' ;X  can extract  events  f romsentences and classify them.
Since ABEX andthe L IS  fo rm nsc only  l im i ted  knowledge , thesys tem need not const ruct  or  n la inta in a largeamount  o f  knowledge.1 Int roduct ionAutomatic abstraction, a lnajor natural auguagc \]n'uecss-ing application, is difficult to achieve.
Luhn\[5\] developeda very simple extraction method that searches for thekeywords ill each sentence.
This type nf abstraction iseasy to accomplish, but its quality is poor.
Other abstrac-tion methods\[6, 31 utilize natural anguage unders~ding(NLU).
However NLU is still in the development s age.For achieving ood practical performance, it is necessaryto treat the thformation expressed in a tlocument uni-formly so that it can be analyzed with only a small fixedamount of knowledge.We propose tile L.IS form which allows inlormatinnabout events tO Lvd uni lo l ln ly treated, t;urt\[lcl~nore, thesemantE engine only uses abstract words, this reduces thcsize of the knowledge.
So the semuntic engine projectsa sentence to a LIS form within a lmdted anloant ofknowledge.In abstraction, classification is the first step.
Classifica-tion is performed using unilorln approach, the LIS lkmn.LIS event representation ullow us to select and classifysentences,2 A semant ic  engine2.1 What is the l,anguage InformationStrncture(LIS) form?The LIS form expresses the inlormation structure thatpernlits commnnication between individuals.
If two inodividuals communicate about one that happened (willhappen) m the real world, the core inlormation is theevent.
Sometm~es a pe,aker will atulche an attitude to theevent.
So information al~ml real world is expressed bythe event and the attitude of tile speaker.2.2 L1S fo rmIn the LIS form, there are two types of feature-structure,word feature-strncture and event feature-structure.
Al-most all slots of tile word feature-stxucture are filled withappropriate values and lew slots of the event feature-structure are empty.
The semantic engine tries to fill allslots of lhe feature-structure.2.2.1 Event feuture-str uctureEvent has one leature-structure, the role lkkqture.
The sen-tence conlilins one or more events and die event feature-structure indicates the role of words or phrases in theevent.
The role feature is either essential or extensional.Seven essential roles have been created: as AGENT, OB-JECT, ACTION, LOCATION, TIME, FROM, and TO.These roles are defined not for verbs but for events.
Thisis quite diflerent li'om Fillmore's cases \[2\].
Therefore, theaction ill the event is represented by the ACTION slot,which c~ln be lilled by verbs, nouns, gerunds, and so oil.It is not necessary to fill the ACTION slot by a verb.l:or exulnple, tile phra.sc " a laud tmrchase agreement"is dealt with as one event in the LIS, and the ACTIONslot-value is "agreement".
Other slots, such as AGENT,OBJECT, LOCAI'ION, TIME, FROM and TO slots areahoost he same as in Fillmore's cases of 'agent', 'object','location', 'time', 'source', and 'goal (or experiencer)'.It is important that our role model deals with the roles ofwords (or pltrases) in an event, not word meaning.Using just seven essential roles, it is difficult to assigna talc to a word (or a phrase).
To overcome this problem,AcrEs DECOL1NG-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOl~f 1992 8 7 5 PROC.
OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992we introduce xtensional roles which allow to be moditiedby the addition of "/constraint".2,2.2 Word feature-structureWord has six features.
These are semantic lizature (DDF)slot, numerical-value slot, date slot, constmtint slot, modal-ity slot, and word string slot.Using the semantic feature, the event feature-structurewill be determined during semantic interpretation process.Six classes of semantic features are defined, such as INDI-VIDUAL, ELEMENT, THING, ACTION, LOCATION,and TIME These classes are instantiated to the DomainDependent semantic Features (DDF) when tile domain isdecided.The constraint fcmure restricts the feature-su'ucturc ofbrother words or t)hrases.
FurthcrlllOre, tile constraintfeature determines the relations betweell word feature-structure and event feature-structure, ht Japanese lan-guage, a word which have a ACTION DDF usually hasthe constraint feature that determines tile slots of eventfeature-structure.The numerical-value slot expresses numerical value ofa word ; 0, 1 , 2, - -  (one) , ?i (hundred) , :1"- (thousand), and so on.
The calculation of countthg up and downis necessary, so all figures are separated.
The nmnerical-value feature will be expressed as folh)ws.
(Onr notationof a feature-structure is ~eature-name =feature-value\].
)\[numerical-value= \[s~icr')~!
!dTidg~it .

.
\] \]The date slot expresses event occurrence time and isexpressed by the Christian era.
In the Christian era, daysare counted by numbers, so that date slots arc calculatednsing the numerieal-value f ature.
The date slot has aminute slot, a second slot, a hour slot, a day slot, a monthslot, and a year slot.
Eacll slot is expressed in nmnericalvalue.The modality slot is classilied into three c,'ttcgories;tense, aspect, and uqood.
Since tile tense and aspect arelinguistically Iixed, we use an ordinary categorization.However, mood is needed to be categorized ifferently,because the information unit used this system is an event.So we categorized mood as a combination of Bratman'sBelief-Desire-lnten lion model\[ 1 \] and modal ogic.
That isthe skate of event is expressed hy modal logic (necessaryoperator, possible operator, and negation sign) and theattitude of speakers cart tx~ cthssiliod into belief, desire,and intention.
For example, a seurence I think it tspossible to construct a plant there will be expressed asBelief(Possibleli', where E means an event;constructa plant there, that is, the individual believes that E ispossible.Furthermore, it is necessary to consider u situation inwhich information is transferred.
In tfie newspaper, itis created by journalists who get information from otherservices (person or company information bureau), ht thissituation, the event aml the attitude of file inforumtionpossessor (IP) is transported to a speaker (SP);journalist.The journalist hen reexpresses the information to reflecthis attitude.
If the modality of IP and SP are expressed asM odalit ~,/se (), M odalit Yl v (), respectively, informationin newspaper is expressed as,M odalitys p ( M odality, e( E V E N T) ) ).If the target document is newspaper, the LIS formincludes the modality of speaker (Modalitysp) and themodality of information possessor (Modalitylp).2.3 Projection MechanismParsing is done using Morphological analysis and De-pendency zmalysis\[4\] attd yields a syntactic tree for asentence,After the parsing, we search a feature-structure dictio-nary to extract feature-structures of all words related tothe domain.
To perform semantic analysis with limitedknowledge, word feature-structures are prepared only forabstract words.
The registration of proper nouns are leftto the user.
The semantic engine infers the semanticmeaning of words or phrases from the system default anduser registrations held in the dictionary.
This means thesemantic engine do not need all knowledge of words forsemantic interpretation.
Thus only a small amount ofwords need to be maintained.After attaching the appropriate word feature-structure toall important words, semantic interpretation can proceed.From the type of propagation for the feature-structure ina parsing tree,there are two types of features.
One is thesynthesized type whose value is calculated from sons tofatber relationship of the parsing tree.
The other is theinherited type that are calculated from father or brothers.Word string, DDF, numerical-value, date, and modalityfeatures are synthesized type and other features, such asconsmdnt and role are inherited type.
The propagation erafeature-structure is accomplished by unification calculus,but the grammar is different.For DDF features, the grammar is as follows.Ii'.I)DF ::= iml~ fini~eN.DDI'" ::= NI .l)l)Fq~ N2.DDFq,... N,.DDFN.I)DF ::= individaal(company)lelement(corapm~y) lmoneylmanlproductlaction(company)llocation\[timeNote: Uncapitalized words mean terminate and capitalized wordsmean nonterminate.
E means EVENT node structure andN means other node structure and N.DDF means DDFfeature-value in node 'N'.
Symbol 'n' is the number ofnodes.
Operator ,~ means unification operator.For the constraint feature,E,constraint ::= ~ (NI.DDF@ E)i=l,...,nN ...... t,'aint ::= ~ (N).DDF@N)j= l , .

.Tile calculation of number aud date features is donelike a stack.
The nmnerical-value f ature has one stackand date feature has six stacks.For example, lbr the number 1992, all die numbers, 1.2. and 9, are expressed as follows,1 ~ \[numerical-value = (oval (push-number-stack 111\]2 ~ \[numerical-value =(eval (push-nuulber-sluck 2))\]9 ~ \[numerical-vulue = (oval (pusll-numbur-stack 9))}Note: Symbol 'oval' i/lealis ltlal next \[oi112 will be evaluated byCommon-lisp, Symbol 'push-stuck' is the lunction Ihatputs the argumem wdue ou the top el tile stuck,The equation lot tile nun/eric/l-value of 1992 is,1992.numerical-value ={\[numerical-value = ( wtl (push-number-stack 1))\]~\[numerical-vuluc =(ovid (push-number-stack 9))\]~\[numerical-value = ( wil (push-number-stack 9))\](9\[numerical-value =(eval (push-number-stack 2))\]Jwhich, after evaluation, gives as the value of 1992 asfollwing expressions,touting ri ht to left, tirst digit being2.
second digit begin 9, and so on,first-digit =: 2 \]second-digit 91992.numerieal-value = third-digit 9fourth-digit 1If we process the phrase, 1992 ~q".
(year 19921, theequation becomes,1992 ~.date :{ 1992.numerical- value ,\],date : (eval(ifSELFnumerical-value )(push-year-stack SELF.numerical.value))) jNote: Nonteriifinate 'SELF' refers to the sell leaturc-structureSymbol 'push-year-stuck' is the functiou that places theargument value to tile year stack ill lhe date feature.Then and we get the time feature-structure as,\[ 1992t, F..date = \[ year  = 1992\]  \]The grammar for modality is quite simple,E.modal i ty ::= Nl.modal ity ~l, N~.modality it,?

There is no node that has agent(company)in DDF, but there are nodes which satisfy the constraint,such as the ~action,_object, and _time which are boundedto nodes n3, n2, hi,respectively.Finally we get the event feature-structure of top noden-top,shown in figure 2.3 An abstraction using the LIS form3.1 The basic method of the abstractionIn tile abstraction, we utilize classification of the LISouqmt.
First, a sentence is put into the LIS form by thesemantic engine.TIle LIS output is used to commence the abstractionprocedurc.
To extract information from sentence, wethink classilicaUon is tile best way.
The semantic engineanalyzes sentence in fixed domain, after the semanticattalysis.
Sentences tire classilied whether an event or not,artd tile system extracts the events which are related to thedomain.Finally, ABEX provides a abstraction.
One abstractionproposed here is the classification of event occurrencetime and similarity of event.
This classification reveals therelationships of each event.
Individual event occurrencetimes will be determnined from value of the time featureand the similarity of events is calculated by comparingevent feature-structure slots.Tile other method is classification by the modality ofinformation.
Front the view point of Modal i ty tp ,  we canclassify an event according to the modality of informationpossessor (1P).
If there is no modality in the event, weclassify it as 'fact'.
Others are classified using modalityfeature.
This classification of tile event's modality revealsthe attitude of the information possessor.ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTF~S, 23-28 Ao~r 1992 8 7 8 Pate.
