the automatic analysis of text us-ing the theory of frame semantics.
We dis-cuss how the FrameNet lexicon and frame-annotated datasets have been used by sta-tistical NLP researchers to build usable,state-of-the-art systems.
We also focus onfuture directions in frame-semantic pars-ing research, and discuss NLP applicationsthat could benefit from this line of work.1 Frame-Semantic ParsingFrame-semantic parsing has been considered asthe task of automatically finding semanticallysalient targets in text, disambiguating their se-mantic frame representing an event and scenarioin discourse, and annotating arguments consistingof words or phrases in text with various frame el-ements (or roles).
The FrameNet lexicon (Bakeret al., 1998), an ontology inspired by the theoryof frame semantics (Fillmore, 1982), serves as arepository of semantic frames and their roles.
Fig-ure 1 depicts a sentence with three evoked framesfor the targets ?million?, ?created?
and ?pushed?with FrameNet frames and roles.Automatic analysis of text using frame-semantic structures can be traced back to the pi-oneering work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002).
Al-though their experimental setup relied on a prim-itive version of FrameNet and only made useof ?exemplars?
or example usages of semanticframes (containing one target per sentence) as op-posed to a ?corpus?
of sentences, it resulted in aflurry of work in the area of automatic semanticrole labeling (M`arquez et al., 2008).
However, thefocus of semantic role labeling (SRL) research hasmostly been on PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005)conventions, where verbal targets could evoke a?sense?
frame, which is not shared across targets,making the frame disambiguation setup differentfrom the representation in FrameNet.
Further-more, it is fair to say that early research on Prop-Bank focused primarily on argument structure pre-diction, and the interaction between frame and ar-gument structure analysis has mostly been unad-dressed (M`arquez et al., 2008).
There are excep-tions, where the verb frame has been taken into ac-count during SRL (Meza-Ruiz and Riedel, 2009;Watanabe et al., 2010).
Moreoever, the CoNLL2008 and 2009 shared tasks also include the verband noun frame identification task in their evalua-tions, although the overall goal was to predict se-mantic dependencies based on PropBank, and notfull argument spans (Surdeanu et al., 2008; Haji?cet al., 2009).The SemEval 2007 shared task (Baker et al.,2007) attempted to revisit the frame-semanticanalysis task based on FrameNet.
It introduced alarger FrameNet lexicon (version 1.3), and also alarger corpus with full-text annotations comparedto prior work, with multiple targets annotated persentence.
The corpus allowed words and phraseswith noun, verb, adjective, adverb, number, deter-miner, conjunction and preposition syntactic cat-egories to serve as targets and evoke frames, un-like any other single dataset; it also allowed targetsfrom different syntactic categories share frames,and therefore roles.
The repository of semanticrole types was also much richer than PropBank-style lexicons, numbering in several hundreds.Most systems participating in the task resortedto a cascade of classifiers and rule-based modules:identifying targets (a non-trivial subtask), disam-biguating frames, identifying potential arguments,and then labeling them with roles.
The systemdescribed by Johansson and Nugues (2007) per-formed the best in this shared task.
Next, we focuson its performance, and subsequent improvementsmade by the research community on this task.26Figure 1: A partial depiction of frame-semantic structures taken from Das et al.
(2014).
The words in bold correspond to targets,which evoke semantic frames that are denoted in capital letters.
Above each target is shown the corresponding lexical unit,which is a lemma appended by a coarse part-of-speech tag.
Every frame is shown in a distinct color; each frame?s argumentsare annotated with the same color, and are marked below the sentence, at different levels.

The first section shows results on theSemEval 2007 shared task.
The best system in the task, presented by Johansson and Nugues (2007) was later outperformedby SEMAFOR, a system described by Das et al.
(2010).
Both systems use a rule-based module to identify targets.
On theFrameNet 1.5 data, Das et al.
(2014) presented additional semi-supervised experiments using gold targets, which was recentlyoutperformed by an approach presented by Hermann et al.
(2014) that made use of distributed word representations.2 Current State of the ArtJohansson and Nugues (2007) presented the sys-tem that resulted in the best F1score on the Se-mEval 2007 task of collectively identifying frame-evoking targets, a disambiguated frame for eachtarget, and the set of role-labeled arguments foreach frame.
The system contained a set of rule-based heuristics to identify targets followed by acascade of three learned models as mentioned in?1.
Das et al.
(2010) presented a tool called SE-MAFOR,1which improved upon this system witha similar framework for target identification, butonly used two probabilistic models, one for frameidentification, and one for predicting the argu-ments.
The frame identification subpart involveda latent-variable log-linear model, which intendedto capture frames for unseen targets, many ofwhich appeared in the test data.
Moreover, the fea-ture sets in both the models were sufficiently dif-ferent from prior work, resulting in improvements.Table 1 shows results on the SemEval 2007 datafor these two systems.The FrameNet project released more annota-tions and a larger frame lexicon in 2010; Das et al.
(2014) used this dataset, and presented a variety ofexperiments improving upon their prior work, set-ting the new state of the art.
A few salient aspects1See http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/SEMAFOR.of this updated version of SEMAFOR involvedhandling unseen targets using a graph-based semi-supervised learning approach and improved infer-ence using a dual decomposition algorithm.
Sub-sequently, Hermann et al.
(2014) used a very simi-lar framework but presented a novel method usingdistributed word representations for better frameidentification, outperforming the aforementionedupdate to SEMAFOR.
Table 1 shows the perfor-mance in terms of F1score for frames and ar-guments given gold targets.
Recent work on theFrameNet corpora, including the aforementionedtwo papers have used gold targets to measure theperformance of statistical methods because thedistribution of annotated targets in the data variedsignificantly across documents and domains, mak-ing it difficult to build a learnable system for targetidentification.The aforementioned papers focused on thetask of sentence-internal frame-semantic analysis.There have been some investigation of finding im-plicit arguments of frames that may be present inother parts of a document, outside the sententialcontext.
Although there has not been extensiveresearch on this topic, a shared task at SemEval2010 focused on this problem (Ruppenhofer et al.,2010).2Moreover, there has been significant effort2Related work on the analysis of implicit arguments for27in developing unsupervised techniques for induc-ing frame-semantic structures (Modi et al., 2012),to induce FrameNet-like lexicons from weak su-pervision, such as syntactic parses.3 ApplicationsShallow semantic analysis based on FrameNetdata has been recently utilized across various nat-ural language processing applications with suc-cess.
These include the generation of meetingsummaries (Kleinbauer, 2012), the prediction ofstock price movement using (Xie et al., 2013), in-ducing slots for domain-specific dialog systems(Chen et al., 2013), stance classification in debates(Hasan and Ng, 2013), modeling the clarity of stu-dent essays (Persing and Ng, 2013) to name a few.There is strong potential in using frame-semantic structures in other applications such asquestion answering and machine translation, asdemonstrated by prior work using PropBank-styleSRL annotations (Shen and Lapata, 2007; Liu andGildea, 2010).4 Future DirectionsGiven the wide body of work in frame-semanticanalysis of text, and recent interest in using frame-semantic parsers in NLP applications, the futuredirections of research look exciting.First and foremost, to improve the quality of au-tomatic frame-semantic parsers, the coverage ofthe FrameNet lexicon on free English text, and thenumber of annotated targets needs to increase.
Forexample, the training dataset used for the state-of-the-art system of Hermann et al.
(2014) containsonly 4,458 labeled targets, which is approximately40 times less than the number of annotated targetsin Ontonotes 4.0 (Hovy et al., 2006), a standardNLP dataset, containing PropBank-style verb an-notations.
This comparison is important becauseFrameNet covers many more syntactic categoriesthan the PropBank-style annotations, and featuresmore than 1,000 semantic role labels compared to51 in Ontonotes, but severely lacks annotations.
Amachine learned system would find it very hardto generalize to new data given such data sparsity.Increasing the quantity of such annotations re-quires exhaustive inter-annotator agreement stud-ies (which has been rare in FrameNet corpora gen-eration) and the development of annotation guide-nominal targets in NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004) has beeninvestigated recently (Gerber and Chai, 2012).lines, such that these annotations can be producedoutside the FrameNet project.Other than increasing the amount of labeleddata, there is a necessity of automatically aligningpredicate-level semantic knowledge present in re-sources like FrameNet, PropBank, NomBank andVerbNet (Schuler, 2005).
These lexicons share alot of knowledge about predicates and current re-sources like Ontonotes do align some of the infor-mation, but a lot remains missing.
For example,alignment between these lexicons could be donewithin a statistical model for frame-semantic pars-ing, such that correlations between the coarse se-mantic role labels in PropBank or NomBank andthe finer labels in FrameNet could be discoveredautomatically.Finally, the FrameNet data is an attractive testbed for semi-supervised learning techniques be-cause of data sparsity; distributed word represen-tations, which often capture more semantic infor-mation than surface-form features could be ex-ploited in various aspects of the frame-semanticparsing task.AcknowledgmentsThe author thanks Desai Chen, Andr?e Martins,Nathan Schneider and Noah Smith for numerousdiscussions and several years of collaboration onthis topic at Carnegie Mellon.
