INTRODUCTION.In this paper I describe ~ system for the on-linesemantic analysis of texts of up to paragraph length.
Itwas programmed o~d applied in Q32 LISP 1.5 to material oftwo sorts: newspaper editorials and passages of c lass ic~philosophical argument.
The immediate purpose of theanalysis was to resolve the word-sense mmbiguity of thetexts: to tag each word of the texts to one and only oneof its possible senses or meanings, and to do so in sucha way that anyone could judge the output's success orfailure without knowing the coding system.
The systemtackles texts of up to paragraph length because I take itas a working hypothesis that many word-sense ambiguitiescannot be resolved within the bounds of the conventionaltext sentence~ there simply isn't enough context available.The system attempts to detect semantic forms (which Icall templates ) directly in coded text, and not by meansof a conventional syntax analysis.
This restrictionsets the present approach apart from the bet ter -kno~ ones.However, s~ approach like the present one still has to showhow to obtain the information contained in a conventionalsyntax analysis, and I shall do that below?
For eachparagraph of text examined the systez derives a nestedstructure of the semantic templates, which can be thoughtof as its semantic representation.
As I shsX1 show, it maybe necessary for the system to enlarge its own dictionary inan on-line mode in order to obtain such a representation.From a representation, a word-sense resolution o~ the textis read off and printed out, since the representation containsone and only one sense representation for each constituentword of the text.21The basic item, tha template, is intended to express, incoded form, the message content of an elementary clause orsentence.
Thus, if we had to analyse the sentence "The oldpostman is angry", I would expect to match with it a templatethat could be interpreted as "A certain kind of man is ina certain state".
Similarly, if analysing thQ clause "Thewicked wizard", I would expect to match with it a tsmplatethat could be interpreted "a man is of a certain kind".
Themain hypothesis of the system of sense analysis is that onecan build up a 'proper semantic sequence' of such templatesas a representation of "semantically compatible" fragmentsof text.
At the end of the paper I shall discuss thepossibility of ex~lig.at~n~ the difficult notion of "meaningfullan~age" .
But at the beginning I am assuming that, if atext is meaningful then its parts must cohere together insome structured way, and that "semantic compatibility" mightexpress that way.
This working hypothesis will also meanthat the word-senses that can participate in such a propersequence will be the appropriate ones.
By "appropriatesenses" I ~ean simply the dictionary word-senses that atranslator of the text would wish to distinguish from theinappropriate ones.By way of example, I shall consider the semanticcompatibilities of the fragments of a p~ro~raph to befound in a'Tizes editorial in December 1966.
As givenbelow it has been frag~_e~e~ by functions whose operationsI shall describe - ,:, but I shall assume that it iscomprehensible as a sequence of.twelve items:*note.I23~4t.. 56\[V-8f9~-10L12((BRITAINS TP~'~SPORT SYSTE~4S ARE CI~NGING)(~d~D WITH IT TIYE TRAVELLING PUBLICS HJ~BITS)(IT IS THE OLD PEP~IANENT WAY)(~'/HICH ONCE MORE IS EZ~RGING)(AS T~ PACE~a~)(~I~LLINES LATELY HAVE BEEN LOSING TP~d~FIC)(TO MODERNIZED P~%ILWAYS)(RAILWAYS AT LAST ~E BEGINNING)(TO TAKE SO~ CI~S(OFF THE CONGESTED SYSTE2,iS TO T j~ THE WEIGHT)(IF THE NEW IDE~S ARE FORWI~D PRESSED)(COM!~'~.

A paragraph in fragment form and it's semanticcompatibilities.Let's now look at possible semantic compatibilitiesbetween fragments of the paragraph (marked with braces inthe left hand margin of the figure above).Fragments I & 2 are semantically compatible (bethessentially assert that a structure is of a certain sert:(I) that a system is changing, (2) that a structure is thepublic's.)
This requires that one takes "to be of a certainsort" in its usual wide logical sense to cover such notionsas change and movement:.
~  are semantically compatible (both essentially assertthat something is moving in some way).7&8 are semantically compatible (both essentially assertthat the railways are near to us in time in some way).are semantically compatible (both essentially assertthat something is taking or removing something)..31 & 12 are semantically compatible (both essentially assertthat s~me structure is changing or about to change).Notice that semantic parallelisms of this sort betweenfragments are sufficient to resolve at least one ambiguityin each of the pairs of fragments: for examplethe correctsense of "habits" for fragment 2 is "structure of behaviour",rather than the less-common "articles of dress".
Thu_~spointing out this parallelism is also selecting the appropriatesense of "habits".2.
THE TEXTS AND SEF~NTIC DICTIONARYTen paragraph length texts were chosen for analysis: fivefrom randomly chosen Times~'editorials (data texts); and fivefrom the works of philosophers, Descartes, Leibniz, Spinoza,Hume and Wittgenstein.
The reason for the choice of ~histype of material will emerge in the discussion.
Each paragraphwas stored as a list of sentences on a LISP file, and analphabetical concordance for the texts was obtained with theaid of standard routines.
From this the semantic dictionarywas written.The information stored for each dictionary entry word isa list of pairs, each member of which consists of a left-handmember which is a semantic formula such as (((THIS POINT) TO)SIGN) THING), and a right-hand member~which is a sensedescription of the meaning of the corresponding formula, suchas (COIv~AS8 AS INSTRUMENT POINTING ~O~TH).
Each such pair(called a sense-pair) corresponds to one sense of the dictionaryentry word.
The sense description (right-hand member of pair)serves only to explain to the operator, in ordinary languageprint-out, which particular sense of the word is beingoperated on at any give~ stage of the procedure.
The sense.descriptions are not used as data for computation, except forlooking at their first item to get the ne~e of the word inquestion.The purpose of the formulae is to encod%and so d is t in~ishthe different sense~ of natural language words: one would expectto assigm a different formula to each major sense of a wordthat a good dictionary distinguishes.
Formulaeconsists  ofleft and right parentheses and ~!ements, where an element isone of the following 53 primitive semantic classifiers ormarkers;BE BEAST CAN CAUSE CHANGE COUNT DO D0h-E FEEL FOLKFOR FORCE FROM GRAIN HAV~ HOW IN KInD LET LIFE LIkELINE ~AN MAY MORE MUCH MOST ONE PAIR P~RT PLA~TPLEASE POINT Sf~E SELF SENSE SIGN SPREf~ STUFF THINGTHINK THIS TO TRUE UP USE WANT ~EN WHERE WHOLEWILL WORLD ~RAP.These elements constitute the major categories of theclassification of word-senses.
The whole class of elementsis not chosen at r~ndom; though as with ~o~ny system ofsemantic markers it is difficult to justify its membershipin detail on theoretical grounds (though see 4).
I shallassume here only that one has to choose some set of markersto work with, and anyone's set of markers is always open todetailed objection.
The markers are the basic elements interms of which all the others in this system (templates,formulae etc.)
are defined.
So they cannot themselves befurther defined, except by means of ~ table of 'scope notes:which gives the dictionary maker some indication of themarker elements.
The table contains entries like:GRAIN~ (II,IV,~-I) any kind of structure or pattern.
(III) structural or pattern-like.6.The Roman numerals refer to the six types of bracketgroups used by the dictionary maker in constructing formulae.They are, in order, Adverbial Group, Adverbial Clause,Adjunctive Group, Nominal Group, Operative Group, OperativeClause.
The first two, for example, can be illustrated asfollows:I. Adverbial Group.
((TRUE I, gCH) HOW)--equivalent for "enough" used asan adverb; same function as "rather nicely" inEnglish; can end with element HOW.II.
Adverbial Clause(FLA FROM)--same function as "out of sight" inEnglish; cannot end with any of the elements ofD4 below, and hence a II type cannot be a well-formed formula (see below) by itself.All these six types of sub-parts of formulae canthemselves be interpreted (as can the formulae) so that eachleft-part is dependent on the corresponding right-part.
Thisis a non-intuitive order in LISP but is an aid to reading theformulae for English speakers.
This is best explained by meansof an exe~ple.
Thus, to take a sense-pair at r~mdom, sayKIND)(COLOURLESS AS NOT H~VING THE PROPerTY OF COLOUR)))).i~u explanation would be; "Colourless" is a sort; a sortindicating that something does Dot possess some property;the property is an abstract sensuous property of a certainsort; that certain sort has to do with spatialft is not difficult to see that that is what (in right-left order) the formula conveys..Formulae are defined recursively as follows:D.I.
A formula is a binarily bracketted string of formulaeand atoms.D.2.
An atom is an element, or an element immediatelypreceded by "NOT".It follows from this that an element is not a formula.Not all formulae can be assignGd to sense-pairs, but onlywell-formed formulae:D.3.
The head of a formula is its last atom.
(and so is theopposite of the usual notion of 'head' in LISP 1.5).D.4.
A well-formed formtul a (wff) is (a) a formula, and (b)such that its head is one of the following elements:HOW KIND FOLK GAIN N~ Pf~T SIGN STUFF THING WHOLEWOP~LD BE Cf~SE CH~IGE DO ~EEL H~VE PLELSE PAIR SENSEW~T US~ THIS.7.
IN IT I~ ~GM~NTLT ION OF THE TEXTS.~ initiol set of functions breaks each sentence of aparagraph up into strings of words, and, in certain circum-stances, reforms discontinuous sub-strings into whole strings.The output from this process is a sentence in the form of alist of "sentence fragments", each of which (if it is not asingle word) is either an elementary sentence, a complexnoun phrase, or a clause introduced by a marker (such as apreposition).
* So for example, the first paragraph of textis returned as on p.2 above by a function which applies thes e ~ g ~ ~  to each of the sentences of a paragraph inturn, and returns the paragraph as a single list of such sub-strings, thus obliterating the original s~ntence boundaries.
* These markers are largely derived from Earl ?
(3)8.It can be seen from the example paragraph above that thefunctions described do not simply segment sentences in alinear manner.
They also 'take out' certain kinds of clausefrom within a sentence and append them as separate sub-strings.An example of this 'taking out' and reforming can be seen inthe example paragraph reproduced above.
The first two fragmentsread ((BRITAINS TRZnNSP0~T SYSTEm,S ,~E CH/~,fGING)(~D WITH IT THETRLVELLING PUBLICS H~BITS)).These are produced Irom a sentence that originally read "Brit~ine~ransport system and with it the travelling publics habits arecheJ~ging".
This sort of break-up leads to ~ apparent grammat-ical 'howler', namely a singular subject for a plural verb.~ut for the purposes of semantic analysis by the present systemthat is not a disadvantage: it is more than outweighed byhaving the text cut into sezanticelly acceptable units (seeHall iday(4~ for the attachment of templates to them.The fragmonted paragraphs are not passed directly to thetemplate-matching procedure, but are first processed by a setof re-ordering functions.
These inspect the fragmented outputfor a parag, raph and seek for qualifying phrases beginningwith m~ker  words like 'of' and 'for'.
These are delimitedat their other end by the character 'fo', and are placed as.
as area whole before the word they qual i fy/adject ives before thepreceding noun and so on.
0nly after this rearrs~ugement arethe fragments passed on to the matching functions.
The reasonfor the re-ordering is that when a template has been matchedwith a fragment, the subsequent routines seek for the qualifiersof a noun or verb only to the left of it.
Thus a phrase "abook of rules" goes to the matching routines as "a of rulesfo book".9.The purpose of the fragment unit is to define a unit ofcontext between the word ~aqd thc sentence, as usually under-stood.
I shall call "internal" those semantic routines whichoperate wholly within fragments, and "external" those whichscan text outside\]particular fragment in order to resolve it,~&.
.word-senses.$.
THE SYSTEM OF S~?
'~TTIO ~L~LYSIS.Production of single bare templatesThe present system replaces each fragment of text by anumber of strings of formulae (fra~es) constructed from th~formulae for the words of the fragment.
It then searches eachframe and replaces it by a number of matchinj templates, ormeaning structures.
One can display these procedures schemat-ically as follows:TEXTTenpla_t es.... i (structured selectionsFrames :.
'..,~_-~-~ from the form-strings)Fragments ~__.~-"/ (of fo rmulae~ ~---''/ (of text) ~ .Fig.
2.
Attac.hment of text to templates.In the course of these procedures, therefore, each fragment oftext is tagged to a number of templates, and so each suchtemplate is tagged to ~ome n~.r~cul,'ir sei~c~ion of the word-senses for the words of a fragm,+~:~:~.
The purpose of thesubsequent procedures -is to re4u.

,.
,~" so specifying a p~rt-icular s~-~ of worO,sensec .,.r '-h ~.
wo~.~ of the whole text.10.The intuitive goal is that there should be just one stringof templates in the set, and hence a unique ambiguity res-olution of the text.
However, the possibility of a numberof independent resolutions cannot be excluded a priori.Thus the outcome of applying these procedures to atext is either nothing, or a string of sense-explanationsfor the words of the text.
In the case where the outcomeis nothing, further procedures are defined whereby the systemreturns, as it were, to the beginning, adjusts one or moredictionary entries in a determinate way and then tries againto resolve the text.
Thus the positive outcome describedmay be achieved after any one of a finite number of tries.As will be seen, there is a limit to the number of possibletries; and after it has been exhausted, the system has toconclude that the text cannot be resolved by this particularmethod.The procedures of resolution can be put in the form ofa set of phrase-structure rules which produce a nesting offrames of formulae from an initial paragraph symbol P. Therules are given in their generative rather than their analyticform, but I give the "lowest-level" rules first, because theyare the ones applied at the first stage 0f an~ys is .
Thepresentation will thus end up, rather than start, with highestlevel rules P?..., where P is a "paragraph symbol" analogousto the sentence marker, S, in conventional gram~.ar.IFollowing what has been said above:D.5.
A frame for a fragment is a string of formulae such thateach word of the fragment that has a (non-null) dictionaryentry is represented by oue and only one formula, and thatformula has the same linear order in the as the11.corresponding word in the fragment.
Thus the set of allframes consistent with this definition (and with the dictionaryentries for the words of some fragment) constitutes an initialrepresentation of a fragment in the system.We can now define the fundamental notion of template.D.6.
A bare template is any concatenated triple of elementsthat can be produced by Rules I-6 below.

This order we call the standard order,and templates are always considered and compared in thisorder even if located in fragments in other (nonstandard)orders, or in "debilitated forms.

The latterrules produce actual text-items, in the sense of heads (offormulae) to bo located in the frames that represent fragmentsof text directly.In order to produce templates that can plausibly beinterpreted as meaning structures for fragments - in thatthey correspond to the heads and fr~nes for the correct word-senses of the fragments - it is necessary that classes oftemplates be produced in a given order.
There are four suchranks of classes, as shown by the following table:R~/~E TE~T- ITE~ STI/TD~/d9 I~ORMIIIIIIVNI+V NI+V+THISV+NI THIS+V+NIN I +V+N2 NI+V~N2V+N I +N 2 N I +V+N 2NI +N2+V NI +V+N2KIND+NI NI +BE+KINDNI +V+KIND NI +V+KINDN I +KIND+V N I +V+KIhrDV+N I+KIND NI +V+KINDNI +KIND NI+BE+KINDNI +N2 NI +BE+KINDV+KIND THI S+V+KINDV THI S+V+THISNI THI S+BF,+N IKIND T HI S+ V+KINDPig 3- Preference table for bare templates.14.Since Rules 1-11 are nonrecursive, there is no problemabout ordering the Iroductions in this way.
Apart from t heforms given in the table, there are only vacuous cases suchas @+@+~.The above table is intended to make clear the relationbetween the various standard forms (in the rightmost column)and the corresponding "items in frames" produced or recognized(middle column).
Thus in the generative mode, text items areproduced from the standard forms by transposition and deletion.In the analytic mode the text~items are recognized in the rankorder shown, and then transposed and augmented with dummy BEand THIS elements so as to be in standard form fo - fur thercomputation.The actual function of the rank choice is best explainedby example, particularly as regards the composition of Rank I,since the ranks lower than I clearly consist of "debilitatedforms" and it is intuitively plausible to produce fuller formsfirst.
This ordering is one example of the general rule whichenables template matching to do (at least) the work of aconventional grammar; namely, pack the f rame astightly as possible, or, in other words, produce thefullest possible template.The presence in Rank I of the debilitated form KIND+NIcan be understood by considering, for example, the fragment:(THE OLD TR~,TSPORT SYSTEM).To simplify matters I shall cohsider only (i) the frameconsisting of representations of the appropriate senses of thewords in that fragment, and (ii) the frame identical with thefirst except that it contains representations of OLD assubstative (noun = "the old people") and the active (verb)15.form of TRANSPORT.
Thus, by the semantic coding systemdescribed above, those two ~ will contain thefollowing heads, and in the order shown:i .
.
.
.
.
.
.
KIND) ...KIND) ...GRAIN) , andii .
.
.
.
.
.
FOLK) ..... DO) ...GPJ~IN) .Now the above rules generate both(FOLK+DO+GR~N) and (KIND+GRAIN)as strings of text-items; the latter by deletion from(NI+BE+KIND) and (KIND+N1).
It is clear that if the formKIND+NI were not in Rank I with forms like (NI+V+N2) whichyield (FOLI~+DO+GiIAIN), then a substantive phrase like thisone would never receive a proper interpretation, since Rank I(without the form (KIND+NI)) would always look for an active(verb) sense for"trans~o~t"and having found one, would besatisfied.As I have described the process so far both bare templateforms (FOLK+DO+GRAIN) and (GRAIN+BE+KIND) would be produced.I shall show in the next section the additional procedureswhich produce the second of these in preference to the firstProduction of single full templates.Further production rules limit the templates actuallyproduced, and these require the notion of full template,defined as follows:D.IO.
A full template is two triples of formulae such thatthe heads of the first triple constitute a bare template, sndthe second triple can be produced from the first by the rules12-16.D.11.
The six formulae constituting a ~ull template arecalled text-values.16.The six formulae so defined give content to thecorresponding bare template (expressed by the heads ofthree of the formulae).
The rules 12-16 specify the otherthree formulae in such a way that each of them c~m be thequalifier of one of the formulae with a head defining partof the bare template.
The rules 12-16 (not given here forreasons of space) are, in effect, rules producin~ an orderedpair of formulae such that the first is ~m appropriatequalifier for the second.
'Thus rule 13i produces an adjectivetype of formula (one ending in KIND) before a noun-type offormula, and so on.The full templates are the items with which the systemreally operates.
They can be illustrated by contrast withbare templates by considering fragment 3 of the paragraphexamined earlier.
That fragment was "It is the old permanentway".
Among the bare templates produced for it by thesystem are the following two:( ( IT IS THE OLD P'Ei~I';~NENT WAY)((THn~G BE SIGN)(((THIS THING) (IT .,S IN.~TII, X~TE Pi<ONOUN))((BE BE) (IS AS HAS THE P~0P'~RTY))( ( ( (l~d~ FOR) ( (~I~<E POINT) Fi<OM) ) (LINE SIGN) )(w~Y -',s P:.T~ o~ a0UTE))))((THING BE SIGN), (((THIS THING) (IT AS IN/~NI~L.TE PI?0NOUN))((BE BE) (IS ~S H~,S THE PROPFAITY))( (((THIS THING) (TRUE USE) ) SIGN) (',~,~Y AS ME,~NS))) )IThe fragment here is tied to two items, each of whichiS a bare template triple followed by the three formulae inthe sense frame which locate it (their last elements are thesame as thosaof the t~mplate triple A point of17.interpretation should be added here for speakers of .nneries~English: all speakers of British English interpret "way" inthis fragment as having its "path or route" sense in thiscontext.The two bare templates are now expanded to full templatesas follows:((IT IS THE OLD PER~E~TT NAY)((THING BE SIGN)(((0NE THING) (I~ ~,S IN~.~I~TE P~0NOUN))((BE BE) (IS LS m~S THE P~OPERTY))((((THIS THING) (TI<UE USE)) SIGN) (WAY AS ~m~ms))NIL NIL ((NOTOH~,NGE KIND) (P~ENT AS UNCHi~GING)))((THING BE SIGN)(((ONE THING) (IT AS INI,NI~TE PRONOUN))((BE BE) (IS 4S H~S THE mOPm~TY))((((WHERE IN) ((WHERE POINT) N~OI~)) (LINE SIGN))(WAY AS PATH O~ ROUTE))NIL NIL ( (NOTCH~GE KIND) P~h~ENT AS UNCHanGING)))These two items are the expanslons (in fr~\]es of sensepairs) of the two bare templates.
They consist of the sameitems as the bare template plus three for~lulae which are thequalifiers of the first three, (the fourth of the six is thequalifier of the first of the six and so on).
In this the'it' and 'is' have no qualifiers, hence the LISP 'NIL's inthose positions.
Bare templates other than these two worematched onto the fragment, but only these two could beexpanded in this way.
Hence these two were the 'survivors'and the others were rejected from !hrther consideration.When expanding in this way to prodrce fuXl templatesfrom bare ones the following met~,~rule (i15) is applied18.
"Produce preferentially those full templates in which asmany elements as possible are developed by the rules R12-RI4J' This means producing if possible those full templatesin which each element of the bare template has a formallyappropriate predecessor.
By means of a further rule (R16)an attempt is made to produce not only full templates withformally appropriate internal relations, but ~lso ones withsemantically close internal relations as well.
That is tosay, full templates such that the triple of qualifyingformulae are semantically close to the formulae they respect-ively precede.
Where,D.12.i)ii)iii)Two formulae are said to be semantically close if:they share a common pair of elements~ orthey have one or more of the following elements incommon: ONE, COUNT, WOI~D, WHOLE, LIFE, LINZ, ~IUST,SELF, SPReaD, TRUE, ~R~P, ~EN,  WH~-~E, THINK; orTheir cores are such that they are identical, oreither is a member of the other in the sense of alist-member, or the left or right hand member ofeither core is a member of the other.Rules producing more than one templateI can now consider the production of concatenations ofthe full templates described so far.D.13.
A paragraph string is any string of templates producedIby the rules 17 & 18 from the part, graph symbol P.R17.
P -~ Tr+T sif Tris a full template written as a string ofsix formulae thus,{where FrlPr2 is a verb type,on, then19.FI I ~I Irl + Frl + Fr2 + Fr2 + r3 + Fr3 Jis a noun type; F I its qualifier (adjective type); rlF I its qualifier (adverb type) and so r2I I I(T s ~ Fs I + Fsl + Fs2 + Fs2 + Fs3 + Fs3) T s~ (~1 + Ftl + F~2 + Ft2 + F~3 + ?

.+(F I + + Flu2 +&2 + Fd 31 + &3 ),where the values cf the two template forms produced aresemantically close.D.14.
Two full templates T r T s are semantically close if(with the above notation for full templates) at least two ofthe following pairs of formulae are (i) such that the headof the second is identical with, or in the negationaclassof, the first:(Frl Fsl), (Frl ~s3), (Fr2 Fs2 ), (Fr3 Fsl), Fr3 Fs3); and(ii) either they, or their qualifier formulae, are semanticallyclose.
These ten possible directions of connection betweentwo full templates can be shown schematically as follows:r I + Fr I Fr 2 + Fr 3 + Fr3qualifier N TYPE V TYPE qualifier N TYPE4 !?

The ~La~hand form of rule writing isnow being extended to mean that when T s has been rewrittenas Fs1+ ....... +Ps3' then the latter nay be rewritten as theright-hand side of the second arrow.This "expansion-concatenation" rule can be recursivelyapplied to the initial productions ffam F .~us  at any stagein the process a paragraph string of full templates isproduced.
At any point the string can be considered terminaland with the aid of the dictionary of words and sense-pairs,the paragraph string of templates can be converted tca  stringof frames and so to a text of words.
This is Pmalagous tothe introduction of the lexicon in any standard phrase-structure gr~r .
The dictionary entries themselves c~be put in phrase structure for1~l.
For example, if a word W nhas two sense pairs $I and $2 in its dictionary entry, thenthe sense-pairs themselves c~m be put in the form $I ~W nand $2 ~W n respectively.
This form of the dictionary entriesis useful in representing the self-~odification of the systemdescribed below.~o APPLICATION OF THE SYSTEM TO TEXTS.Matchin~ bare templates onto fragments.Rules I-6 above define the matching of bare templatesonto a fragmented text, one bare template onto each textfragment.
TEMPO is the main (top level) function that doesthis: it examines in turn all the frames of sense pairs fora fragment, and so on for all the fragments of a paragraph.21.It takes as its argument a frame of sense-pairs, one foreach word of a given fragment.
TEMPO scans each suchcombination in turn, starting with the frame containing ellthe main senses of the words in the fragment (the first onesin the dictionary entry for each word).
TEF~O searches fortriplets of heads in the order of preference given in fig.3,above.
For example, if it finds type I templates it doesn'tlook for any of types II-IV and so on.
Each type of templateis collected on a list which is the value of a differentfree LISP variable.
If TEMPO finds nothing till it reachesthe debilitated N+N forM, it replaces the N+N by N+BE+N (BEbeing the "dummy verb").
Similarly V+N and N+V are replacedby THIS+V+N ~nd N+V+THIS respectively (THIS being the "d~mysubstantive").
The function of thes~ dulmny features is tosupply a general form of template for subsequent processing,even when it is not wholly present in the text.
Suppose, forexample, a fragment consisted not of an assertion form, butof a noun phrase like "the black wizard" j where the headsof the appropriate codings for "black" and "wizard" would b ,KIND and ~h~N respectively.
As there is no verb, a debilitatedtemplate of the N+N form would match onto these two heads,and that would then be converted into ~'~+BE+~IND.
whichis the intuitively correct interpretation (WIZ2~D is BLACK).The dummy verb is added in the way d~scribed; and in caseslike this, where the first head is the predicate KIND, theorder of the two heads is reversed, so as to give the I~:~+BE+KIND form.
This transposition is defined by R11i.The internal rejection functions (matchin~ full temFlates )Earlier I distinguished between internal and externalprocedures.
Internal rejections are those procedures whichcast out matchint~ templates I.~ means of the22.expansion from bare to full templates.
The n~in functionwhich does this is PICKUP.
It takes a fragment name asargument and constructs the TEMPO value for it.
PICI<UPmakes a decision in the case of each template whether or notto reject it ~om further consideration.
Those that surviveare then considered further by the external rejectionprocedures.
The survivors from PI0i(UP represent a s Bage ofazbiguity resolution beyond that given by TEMPO?
If, forex~mple, PICI(UP examines a template that has been matchedonto a fragment containing the wordsround box, where ~template head had been attached to a formula for box, then,hopefully, PICI~-P keeps at least the template in which roundis coded by its "spatic~ property sense" and bo~'is coded byits "container" sense.Inside PICIGIP the function REFINE returns as its valuea list of five sub-lists of full templates: its first sublistcontains those form-close internally in four ways (as definedby rules 12-15), down to the last sub-list containing tT~osewith ~P such closeness.
PICKUP takes the first non-emptysub-list of REF INEand of that~returns as its value the~fulltemplates that are se~uantically close as well (if any).The 'semantic p~rser'; resolving a paragraph.The top-level function P:~RSP/~P~'~ takes as its argumenta llst of fragments, pro~uces the PICLzUP value for each (inthe full template form given on p.14) and then parses thesefull templates using rules 17 &' 18.
A nesting of templatesthat satisfies these rules is ~_u interpretation for thepara~raph, and its word-sense content is read off and printedout( since a nesting of full templates is simply a \ selectionof the possible word-sense assignr.~ents for a text:) Fulltemplates which cannot be parsed with those for other23.fragments are simply rejected .~ is  is the ~ternal rejectionprocedure referred to earlier.Functions called FIT ~nd JAM express rule 18: theytest for semantic closeness between two full templates and,if such closeness is found, the two full templates arereplaced by a single item with the form of a full template.Or - to put it in terms of the two function names - if thefull templates ~IT, they are then JAMmed.
If the threemain formulae in a full template are related to the threemain formulae of another template by any three of theconnectivities expressed in fig.4, above, then the twotemplates FIT (s~e semantically close).
The function JAMbuilds up a representation of the two templates based ontheir connectivities.
PIT and JAM work with message-pairs,which are to a fragment what a sense pair is to a word.D.15.
A me.ssa~e-pair is a two-item list: one item is alist of the first three sense-pairs of some full template,the other item is a list containir~g the name of some fragmentwith which the full ~mplate ~e~tches.Pi~ISP~a~J~ constructs the PICIqUP value (full templates)for its list of fragments, and then builds uD all possibleframes of message-pairs for the peoragraph.
Each frame ofmessageopairs is now a possible meaning representation forthe whole paragraph, PI~RSPI~R~'~ then scans each frame inturn to see if it can find a right-left contiguous pair ofmess~e-pai rs  satisfying FIT.
If it c?~ it deletes thefirst message-pair and replaces the ,~ ~cond by a message-pairconsisting of (I) the JAM value of the !~ro 'parsed' fulltemplates, and (2) a list of the names of he fitting fragments.?

~.irst two frs~@ments of the resolved output for e.text paragraoh.The original Englis~ for the first two fragments of thatparagraph was "Britain's transport system and with tt thetravelling public's habits are cha~i~Ig".The sense constructor" procedure.A procedure was built in to the system to deal with the26.cases where the system returned (NO RESOLUTION ALL PATHSBLOC~D)  at the teletype.
This situation could arise for anumber of reasons; the text fragments did not cohere togethersufficiently; a vital word sense had been left out of thedictionary; or a word in the text was being used in a newand original sense.
An obvious suggestion for tacklingthis is to allow the word dictionary to enlarge itself:to supply an additional sense entry for the word that isholding the procedure up, if it can be found.
Such a const-ruction could thought of as adding a new rule F - a, whereP is a formula and a word name, and so expanding to a newrule system as the system adjusts to the particular text.In practice PARSPARA examined the value of a freevariable BESTPARS each time it failed to parse a framecompletely.
It stored as th8 value of BESTPARS the parsingtree containing the templat~ that had been rewritten least.It seemed a good first guess at the recalcitrant word thati t  was in template that 'cohered' least with its neigbours.If all the frame blocked PARSPARA would print (CONSTRUCTER MODE)and evaluate a function of no variables called C0~TSTRUCTER.This function controls all subsequent operations via theREAD and PRINT functions at the teletype.
CONSTRUCTER looksa~ the value of the recalcitrant template in BESTPA~S andsuggested that a word in the corresponding fragment have itsdictionary of sense pairs enlarged by identifying the recalci-trant word with the most 'semantically close' word in theparagraph.
If the operator accepts the system's suggestionat the teletype, the system is rerun with the enlargeddictionary to try and get a resolution.
In such a case (orif none of the system's suggestions are acceptable to theoperator) the system returns to the normal operating mode.This procedure was not called upon for the newspaperparagraphs, but it produced some interesting suggestions inthe case of two of the philosophical paragraphs.27.In CONSTRUCT:~ MODE dialogues like the following are possible:( CONSTRUCT~R MODE)((NO RESOLUTION ALL PATHS BLOC~2ED)(BEST PARSING CONTAINS)((( ((KIND SIGN) (ATTRIBUTE AS A PARTICULAR KIhrD OFPROPERTY) )((BE BE) (DUm~))((S.m~ KIND) (S:fl:~ AS IDENTICAL) )((',~IHOLE (MUST (KIND SIGN)))(N_~TD-i~E .~S ESSENCE 0It ESSENTI~ P~{0P~RTIES))NIL NIL)(I{ECiILCITR~T TEMPLf..TE IS ~0ii)(THE SI~,~ f.~TIY~{E OR ATTRIBUTE)(CONTINUE YES 0f~ NO)YES(SUGGEST 4TTiIIBUTE ..S N~TUI~E (SH~LL I TRY IT YES 0A NO))YES(((IP THZAE W~E TWO C~{ ~iOf~E DISTINCT SUBST~NCES)((W0\]~DS ~{ESOL~@U~D IN ~R.~GMh~T)((THERE AS AT i, POINT)(OR L8 DISJUNCTION)(~lOt~ A5 I~ A~ J IITCRE/.ZED I~k~NNE~R) "(DISTINCT i~S DIFFE~L~'~T) (SU~ST~ICES "a SO~TS 0FTHDTG) ) )((WORDS NOT f~ESOLV-~D IN ~RAGMI~\]NT)(T~0(((COUNT SIGN) (TWO AS L NUEBER))((COUNT KIND) (TWO ,~S m'XING T~ P~OPmTY 0~ TWOITY)))))fig.

Dialogue in CONSTRUGT...F~T{ MODE together with first partof subsequent resolution.28.6 DISCUSSIONOne of the main difficulties in coding for, andevaluating, a system like this one is the necessary vaguenessof some of the sense-entries (especially evident in wordslike 'it' and 'is').Noh~th~rcbs'I claim, that the presentsystem could constitute a tentative criterion for meanin6-fulness: a text is meaningful if and only if a system like ~h~present one can resolve it.
It is easy enough to get anecessary criterion on the ground that one needs to be ableto tell in what senses the words of a text are being used inorder to call it me~uingful.
I have ar~ed at length else-where that it is possible also to justify the correspondingsufficient one (8).
The establishment of such a criterionwould be of some interest in the cases of the five philosophicalparagraphs, since it was texts like these that Carn~ (2) andthe 'Logical ~yntax' school generally, said could be shownto be meaningless on the basis of a system cf analytic rules,though they never in fact constructed such a system.
Thecriterion suggested here would only be one of degree (in termsof the number of applications of the sense-constructerprocedure a text required for resolution).
That is perhapsthe only acceptable form that a criterion of meaningfulnesscould take, as there seems something absurd about an attemptto set an absolute bound to the meaningful.Another speculative interest of the present system mightbe its application to the speec~ patterns of schizophrenics.Schizophrenic discourse seems (6) to be meaningft~1 withinthe boundaries of units of the same order of length as theclause or phrase.
The trouble is that these units don'tseem to fit together in a coherent ~ay in the schizophrenic's29~speech pattern; ~; system of the present sort, which triesto make such items cohere, might conceivably provide ameasure of "sem~tic  disorder" in such cases.~ number of connexions can be made also between thesemantic structure assigned to a text by the present systemand that assigned by formal logic.
These connexions havebeen invest~ai:e4 in the cases of the five philosophicalparagraphs, which have a form sufficiently like the one requiredby formal logic?
These connexions are of some interest inview of the almost total neglect of the sense-~biguity ofnatural language words by formal logic.One can, for example, interpret the present system soas to create a notion of "valid ~d useful" argument.
Ithas long been recognise~ tha~ an argument can be formallyvalid (and even hmve true premiss~s) ~d yet bc completelyuseless.
This is usually due to a genuine ~o~mbiguity in thearg~ment~ For exs~ple, the followin~ is perfectly valid:"~ l  kings wear crowns, all crowns are coins, th6refore allkings wear coins".
~ndjwithln the context of each premiss,each premiss is true.
(In the "numismatic world of discourse",for examDle, the second is true).2Da argument could be deemed "valid and useful" if it isformally valid an__~d if the present system assigns to it aconsistent and  comDlete interpretation?
I am us i~ the terms?
0 'conslstenl" and 'complete' in a way similar to Bobrow's (I)use of them: an interpretation is complete  if the systemassigns an interpretation to each key term in the argument,and 'consistent-if .,it .a.ssi~ns the same inte.rpretation(wor d-sense) to every occp.rre.ncG of a term.
Thus the arg~unent abovewould not pass the 'usefulness' criterion, since a properambiguity-resolver would assign different ~nterpretatign ~to the two occurrences of the key term 'crown'.3!
