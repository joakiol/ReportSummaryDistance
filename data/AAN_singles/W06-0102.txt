TsouLanguage Information Sciences Research CentreCity University of Hong KongTat Chee Avenue, Kowloon, Hong Kong{rlolivia,rlbtsou}@cityu.edu.hkAbstractThis paper reports on an initial and nec-essary step toward the construction of aPan-Chinese lexical resource.
We inves-tigated the regional variation of lexicalitems in two specific domains, financeand sports; and explored how much ofsuch variation is covered in existing Chi-nese synonym dictionaries, in particularthe Tongyici Cilin.
The domain-specificlexical items were obtained from subsec-tions of a synchronous Chinese corpus,LIVAC.
Results showed that 20-40% ofthe words from various subcorpora areunique to the individual communities,and as much as 70% of such unique itemsare not yet covered in the Tongyici Cilin.The results suggested great potential forbuilding a Pan-Chinese lexical resourcefor Chinese language processing.
Ournext step would be to explore automaticmeans for extracting related lexical itemsfrom the corpus, and to incorporate theminto existing semantic classifications.1 IntroductionMany cities have underground railway systems.Somehow one takes the tube in London but thesubway in New York.
In a more recent editionof the Roget?s Thesaurus (Kirkpatrick, 1987),subway, tube, underground railway and metroare found in the same semicolon-separated groupunder head 624 Way.
Similarly if one looks upWordNet (http://wordnet.princeton.edu; Miller etal., 1990), the synset to which subway belongsalso contains the words metro, tube, under-ground, and subway system; and it is further in-dicated that ?in Paris the subway system is calledthe ?metro?
and in London it is called the ?tube?or the ?underground??.
Such regional lexicalvariation is also found in Chinese.
For instance,the subway system in Hong Kong, known as theMass Transit Railway or MTR, is called ??
inChinese.
The subway systems in Beijing andShanghai, as well as the one in Singapore, arealso known as ?
?, but that in Taipei is knownas ??.
Their counterpart in Japan is written as???
in Kanji.
Such regional variation, as partof lexical knowledge, is important and useful formany natural language applications, includingnatural language understanding, information re-trieval, and machine translation.
Unfortunately,existing Chinese lexical resources often lacksuch comprehensiveness.To fill this gap, Tsou and Kwong (2006) pro-posed a comprehensive Pan-Chinese lexical re-source, based on a large and unique synchronousChinese corpus as an authentic basis for lexicalacquisition and analysis across various Chinesespeech communities.
For a significant worldlanguage like Chinese, a useful lexical resourceshould have maximum versatility and portability.It is not sufficient to target at one particularcommunity speaking the language and thus coveronly language usage observed from that particu-lar community.
Instead, such a lexical resourceshould document the core and universal sub-stances of the language on the one hand, and alsothe more subtle variations found in differentcommunities on the other.
As is evident from theabove example on the variation of subway, re-gional variation should be captured for the lexi-cal resource to be useful in a wide range of ap-plications.In this study, we investigate and compare theregional variation of lexical items from two spe-9cific domains, finance and sports, as an initialand necessary step toward the more importantundertaking of building a Pan-Chinese lexicalresource.
In addition, we make use of an exist-ing Chinese synonym dictionary, the TongyiciCilin (Mei et al, 1984) as leverage, and exploreits coverage of such variation and thus the poten-tial for enriching it.
The lexical items understudy were obtained from a synchronous Chinesecorpus, LIVAC, which will be further introducedin Section 4.
Corpus data from four Chinesespeech communities were compared with respectto their commonality and uniqueness, and alsoagainst Cilin for their coverage.
Results showedthat 20-40% of the words extracted from the cor-pus are unique to the individual communities,and as much as 70% of such unique items are notyet covered in Cilin.
It therefore suggests thatthe synchronous corpus is a rich source formining region-specific lexical items, and there isgreat potential for building a Pan-Chinese lexicalresource for Chinese language processing.In Section 2, we will briefly review existingresources and related work.
Then in Section 3,we will briefly outline the design and architec-ture of the Pan-Chinese lexical resource pro-posed by Tsou and Kwong (2006).
In Section 4,we will further describe the Chinese synonymdictionary and the synchronous Chinese corpusused in this study.
The comparison of their lexi-cal items will be discussed in Section 5.
Futuredirections will be presented in Section 6, fol-lowed by a conclusion.2 Existing Resources and Related WorkThe construction and development of largelexical resources is relying more and more oncorpus-based approaches, not only as a result ofthe increased availability of large corpora, butalso for the authoritativeness and authenticityallowed by the approach.
The CollinsCOBUILD English Dictionary (Sinclair, 1987) isamongst the most well-known lexicographic fruitbased on large corpora.For natural language applications, much of theinformation in conventional dictionaries targetedat human readers must be made explicit.
Lexicalresources for computer use thus need consider-able manipulation, customisation, and supple-mentation (e.g.
Calzolari, 1982).
WordNet(Miller et al, 1990), grouping words into synsetsand linking them up with relational pointers, isprobably the first broad coverage general compu-tational lexical database.
In view of the intensivetime and effort required in resource building,some researchers have taken an alternative routeby extracting information from existing machine-readable dictionaries and corpora semi-automatically (e.g.
Vossen et al, 1989; Riloffand Shepherd, 1999; Lin et al 2003).Compared to the development of thesauri andlexical databases, and research into semanticnetworks for major languages such as English,similar work for the Chinese language is lessmature.
This gap was partly due to the lack ofauthoritative Chinese corpora as a basis foranalysis, but has been gradually reduced with therecent availability of large Chinese corpora in-cluding the LIVAC synchronous corpus (Tsouand Lai, 2003) used in this work and further de-scribed below, the Sinica Corpus (Chen et al,1996), the Chinese Penn Treebank (Xia et al,2000), and the like.An important issue which is seldom addressedin the construction of Chinese lexical databasesis the problem of versatility and portability.
Fora language such as Chinese which is spoken inmany different communities, different linguisticnorms have emerged as a result of the individual-istic evolution and development of the languagewithin a particular community and culture.
Suchvariations are seldom adequately reflected in ex-isting lexical resources, which often only drawreference from one particular source.
For in-stance, Tongyici Cilin (?????)
(Mei et al,1984) is a thesaurus containing some 70,000Chinese lexical items in the tradition of the Ro-get?s Thesaurus for English, that is, in a hierar-chy of broad conceptual categories.
First pub-lished in the 1980s, it was based exclusively onChinese as used in post-1949 Mainland China.Thus for the subway example above, the closestword group found is ?
?, ??
(train) only, letalone the subway itself and its regional variations.With the recent availability of large corpora,especially synchronous ones, to construct an au-thoritative and timely lexical resource for Chi-nese is less distant than it was in the past.
Alarge synchronous corpus provides authentic ex-amples of the language as used in a variety oflocations.
It thus enables us to attempt a com-prehensive and in-depth analysis of the corecommon language in constructing a lexical re-source; and to incorporate useful informationrelating to location-sensitive linguistic variations.103 Proposal of a Pan-Chinese ThesaurusThe Pan-Chinese lexicon proposed by Tsou andKwong (2006) is expected to capture not only thecore senses of lexical items but also senses anduses specific to individual Chinese speechcommunities.The lexical database will be organised into acore database and a supplementary one.
Thecore database will contain the core lexical infor-mation for word senses and usages which arecommon to most Chinese speech communities,whereas the supplementary database will containthe language uses specific to individual commu-nities, including ?marginal?
and ?sublanguage?uses.A network structure will be adopted for thelexical items.
The nodes could be sets of near-synonyms or single lexical items (in which casesynonymy will be one type of links).
The linkswill not only represent the paradigmatic semanticrelations but also syntagmatic ones (such as se-lectional restrictions).We thus begin by investigating in depth theregional variation of lexical items, especiallydomain-specific words, among several Chinesespeech communities.
In addition, we explore thepotential of enriching existing resources as a start.In the following section, we will discuss theTongyici Cilin and the synchronous Chinese cor-pus used in this study in greater details.4 Materials and Method4.1 The Tongyici CilinThe Tongyici Cilin (?????)
(Mei et al,1984) is a Chinese synonym dictionary, or moreoften known as a Chinese thesaurus in the tradi-tion of the Roget?s Thesaurus for English.
TheRoget?s Thesaurus has about 1,000 numberedsemantic heads, more generally grouped underhigher level semantic classes and subclasses, andmore specifically differentiated into paragraphsand semicolon-separated word groups.
Similarly,some 70,000 Chinese lexical items are organizedinto a hierarchy of broad conceptual categories inthe Tongyici Cilin.
Its classification consists of12 top-level semantic classes, 94 sub-classes,1,248 semantic heads and 3,925 paragraphs.4.2 The LIVAC Synchronous CorpusLIVAC (http://www.livac.org) stands for Lin-guistic Variation in Chinese Speech Communi-ties.
It is a synchronous corpus developed by theLanguage Information Sciences Research Centreof the City University of Hong Kong since 1995(Tsou and Lai, 2003).
The corpus consists ofnewspaper articles collected regularly and syn-chronously from six Chinese speech communi-ties, namely Hong Kong, Beijing, Taipei, Singa-pore, Shanghai, and Macau.
Texts collectedcover a variety of domains, including front pagenews stories, local news, international news, edi-torials, sports news, entertainment news, and fi-nancial news.
Up to December 2005, the corpushas already accumulated about 180 million char-acter tokens which, upon automatic word seg-mentation and manual verification, amount toover 900K word types.For the present study, we make use of the sub-corpora collected over the 9-year period 1995-2004 from Hong Kong (HK), Beijing (BJ),Taipei (TW), and Singapore (SG).
In particular,we focus on the financial news and sports newsto investigate the commonality and uniqueness ofthe lexical items used in these specific domainsin the various communities.
We also evaluatethe adequacy of the Tongyici Cilin in terms of itscoverage of such domain-specific terms espe-cially from the Pan-Chinese perspective, andthus assess the room for its enrichment with thesynchronous corpus.
Table 1 shows the sizes ofthe subcorpora used for this study.Subcorpus Overall(rounded to nearest 0.01M)Financial News(rounded to nearest 1K)Sports News(rounded to nearest 1K)Word Token Word Type Word Token Word Type Word Token Word TypeHK 14.39M 0.22M 970K 38K 1041K 39KBJ 11.70M 0.19M 232K 20K 443K 28KTW 12.32M 0.20M 254K 22K 657K 33KSG 13.22M 0.21M 621K 28K 998K 34KTable 1  Sizes of individual subcorpora114.3 ProceduresWord-frequency lists were generated from thefinancial and sports subcorpora from each indi-vidual community.
For each resulting list, thesteps below were followed to remove irrelevantitems and retain only the potentially useful con-tent words:(a) Remove all numbers and non-Chinese words.
(b) Remove all proper names, including thoseannotated as personal names, geographicalnames, and organisation names.
Propernames have been annotated in the corporaduring the process of word segmentation.
(c) Remove function words.
(d) Remove lexical items with frequency 5 orbelow.The numbers of remaining items in each sub-corpus after the above steps are listed in Tables 2and 3 for the two domains respectively.
Thelexical items retained, which are expected to con-tain a substantial amount of content words, arepotentially useful for the current study.
The listsin each domain (from the various subcorpora)were compared in terms of the items they shareand those unique to individual communities.Their unique items were also compared againstthe Tongyici Cilin to investigate its adequacyand explore how it might be enriched with thesynchronous corpus.Subcorpus All After (a) After (b) After (c) After(d)HK 37,525 27,937 20,422 17,162 5,238BJ 20,025 17,361 14,460 12,134 2,791TW 22,142 19,428 16,316 13,496 3,088SG 28,193 22,829 16,863 13,822 3,836Table 2  Number of word types remaining after various data cleaning steps for the financial domainSubcorpus All After (a) After (b) After (c) After(d)HK 39,190 35,720 25,289 21,502 6,316BJ 27,971 26,049 19,799 16,598 3,878TW 32,706 30,231 20,361 17,248 4,601SG 34,040 31,974 19,995 16,780 5,120Table 3  Number of word types remaining after various data cleaning steps for the sports domain5 Results and Discussion5.1 Lexical Items from LIVACThe four subcorpora of the financial domaindiffer considerably in their sizes, and slightly lessso for the sports domain.
Despite this, we ob-served for both domains from Tables 2 and 3 thatin general about 40-50% of all word types arenumbers, non-Chinese words, proper names, andfunction words.
Of the remaining items, about20-30% have frequency greater than 5.
Theseseveral thousand word types from each subcor-pus are expected to be amongst the more interest-ing items and form the ?candidate sets?
for fur-ther investigation.5.2 Commonality among Various RegionsComparing the candidate sets from various sub-corpora, which reflect the use of Chinese in vari-ous Chinese speech communities, Tables 4 and 5show the sizes of the intersection sets amongdifferent places for the two domains respectively.The intersection set for all four places containsslightly more than 1,000 lexical items in the fi-nancial domain.
A quick skim through thesecommon lexical items suggests that they contain,on the one hand, the many general concepts inthe financial domain (e.g.
??
company, ?
?market, ??
bank, ??
invest / investment, ??
business, ??
develop / development, ?
?corporation, ??
stock shares, ??
shareholder,??
capital, etc.
); and on the other hand, manyreportage and cognitive verbs often used in newsarticles (e.g.
??
express, ??
reckon, ?
?appear, ??
reflect, etc.
).In the sports domain, more than 1,700 lexicalitems were found in all of the four subcorpora.Like its financial counterpart, we found manygeneral concepts at the top of the list (e.g.
?
?player, ??
team, ??
match, ??
competi-12tion, ??
league, ??
coach, ??
opponent,??
champion, etc.
).The numbers of overlaps in Tables 4 suggestthat lexical items used in Mainland China (asevident from BJ data) seem to have the least incommon with the rest.
For instance, compared tothe overlap amongst all four regions (i.e.
1,039),the overlap has increased most when BJ was notincluded in the comparison; and when we com-pare any two regions, the overlap between BJand TW is smallest.
Nevertheless, such unique-ness of BJ data is less apparent in the sports do-main.
In particular, the difference betweenHK/BJ and BJ/TW is even slightly less than thatin the financial domain.If we look at the individual regions, HK ap-parently shares most (about 50%) with SG, andvice versa (about 68%), in the financial domain.At the same time, BJ also shares more with HKthan with the other two regions, and so does TW.But surprisingly, BJ has over 60% overlap withSG and about 55% with TW in the sports domain.The overlaps of TW with HK and with BJ differby more than 20% in the finance domain, butonly by about 10% in the sports domain.
Allthese patterns might suggest lexical items in thefinancial domain are more versatile and havemore varied focus in different communities,whereas those in the sports domain reflect themore common interests of different places.Regions Overlap Proportion to individual lists (%)HK BJ TW SGHK / BJ / TW / SG 1039 19.84 37.23 33.65 27.09HK / BJ / TW 1126 21.50 40.34 36.46HK / BJ / SG 1327 25.33 47.55  34.59HK / TW / SG 1581 30.18  51.20 41.21BJ / TW / SG 1092  39.13 35.36 28.47HK / BJ 1609 30.72 57.65HK / TW 1912 36.50  61.92HK / SG 2607 49.77   67.96BJ / TW 1250  44.79 40.48BJ / SG 1505  53.92  39.23TW / SG 1795   58.13 46.79Table 4  Commonality amongst various regions for the financial domainRegions Overlap Proportion to individual lists (%)HK BJ TW SGHK / BJ / TW / SG 1668 26.41 43.01 36.25 32.58HK / BJ / TW 1782 28.21 45.95 38.73HK / BJ / SG 2047 32.41 52.78  39.98HK / TW / SG 2249 35.61  48.88 43.93BJ / TW / SG 1864  48.07 40.51 36.41HK / BJ 2318 36.70 59.77HK / TW 2693 42.64  58.53HK / SG 3305 52.33   64.55BJ / TW 2124  54.77 46.16BJ / SG 2554  65.86  49.88TW / SG 2709   58.88 52.91Table 5  Commonality amongst various regions for the sports domain5.3 Uniqueness of Various RegionsNext we compared the lists with respect to whatthey have unique to themselves.
Table 6 showsthe numbers of unique items found in each list,together with examples from the most frequent20 unique items in each case.Again, taking the size difference among thecandidate sets into account, about 40% of thelexical items found in HK data are unique to theregion, which re-echoes the versatility and wide13coverage of interests of HK data.
This is espe-cially evident when compared to only about 20%of the candidate sets for SG are unique to Singa-pore.1Looking at the unique lexical items found inindividual regions, it is not difficult to see theregion-specific lexicalisation of certain concepts.For instance, in terms of housing, ??
(housingunder the Home Ownership Scheme) is a specifickind of housing in Hong Kong, ??
is a specificterm in Singapore (as seen in SG data), whereashousing is generally expressed as ??
inMainland China (as seen in BJ data).
Similarly,??
(HK) and ??
(BJ) both refer to training,but may relate to different practice in the twocommunities.
Such regional variation lendsstrong support to the importance of a Pan-Chinese lexical resource.The lists of unique items also suggest the vari-ous focus and orientation in different Chinesespeech communities.
For example, while HongKong pays much attention to the real estate mar-ket and stock market, Mainland China may befocusing more on the basic needs like water,farming, poverty alleviation, etc., and Singaporeis relatively more concerned with local affairslike port management.
The passion for baseball,among other more popular sports like soccer, ismost obvious from the unique lexical itemsfound in TW data.5.4 Comparison with Tongyici CilinAs mentioned earlier, the Tongyici Cilin containssome 70,000 lexical items under 12 broad se-mantic classes, 94 subclasses, and 1,428 heads.It was first published in the 1980s and was basedon lexical usages mostly of post-1949 MainlandChina.
In this section, we discuss the results ob-tained from comparing the unique lexical itemsfound from individual subcorpora with Cilin,which are shown in Table 7.On the one hand, Cilin?s collection of wordsmay be considerably dated and obviously willnot include new concepts and neologisms arisingin the last two decades.
On the other hand, thedata in LIVAC come from newspaper materialsin the 1990s.
So overall speaking, for each of theunique word lists, much less than 50% are cov-ered in Cilin.1 Upon further analysis, on average about 60% of these?unique?
items were actually found in one or more of theother regions, but with frequency 5 or below.
Since thedifference in frequency is quite large for most items, we canreasonably treat them as unique to a particular community.Nevertheless, there is still an apparent gap be-tween Cilin?s coverage of the unique items fromvarious places.
About 40% of the unique itemsfound in BJ for both domains are covered; butfor other places, the coverage is more often lessthan 30% in either or both domains.
Again, thiscould be considered a result of Cilin?s bias to-ward lexical usages in Mainland China.In addition, while almost 40% of the uniqueitems in BJ data are found in Cilin, many ofthese unique items covered are amongst the mostfrequent items.
On the contrary, even thoughabout 560 unique items in HK data are alsofound in Cilin, only 3 out of the 20 most frequentitems are amongst them.
In addition, the appar-ent coverage does not necessarily suggest thecorrect match of word senses.
For instance, ?
?is found under head Bn1 together with otheritems like ?
?, ?
?, etc., all of which only re-fer to the general concept of housing, instead ofthe housing specifically under the Home Owner-ship Scheme as known in Hong Kong.
Also,coverage of words like ?
?, ??
and ??
inthe sports domain does not match their actualusages which refer to team names.
A more inter-esting example might be ?
?, which is used inthe basketball context in TW data, and in no wayrefers to the literal ?hot pot?
sense.Results from the above comparisons thus sup-port that (1) different Chinese speech communi-ties have their distinct usage of Chinese lexicalitems, in terms of both form and sense; (2) suchvariation is found in different domains, such asthe financial and sports domain; (3) existinglexical resources, the Tongyici Cilin in particularas in our current study, should be enriched andenhanced by capturing lexical usages from a va-riety of Chinese speech communities, to repre-sent the lexical items from a Pan-Chinese per-spective; and (4) lexical items obtained from thesynchronous Chinese corpus can supplement theexisting content of the Tongyici Cilin, with morecontemporarily lexicalised concepts, as well asvariant expressions of similar and related con-cepts from various Chinese speech communities.Hence it remains for us to further investigatehow the related lexical items obtained from thesynchronous corpus should be grouped and in-corporated into the semantic classification of ex-isting lexical resources; and to further explorehow they might be extracted in a large scale byautomatic means.
These will definitely beamongst the most important future directions asdiscussed in the next section.146 Future WorkIn the current study, we have investigated theregional variation of lexical items from the fi-nancial and sports domain, and the coverage ofthe Tongyici Cilin for such variation.
The resultssuggested great potential for building a Pan-Chinese lexical resource for Chinese languageprocessing.
Our next step would thus be to fur-ther investigate more automatic means for ex-tracting the near-synonymous or closely relateditems from the various subcorpora.
To this end,we would explore algorithms like those used inLin et al (2003).
Of similar importance is themechanism for grouping the related lexical itemsand incorporating them into the semantic classi-fications of existing lexical resources.
In thisregard we will proceed with further in-depthanalysis of the classificatory structures of indi-vidual resources and fit in our Pan-Chinese ar-chitecture.Apart from the Tongyici Cilin, there are otherexisting Chinese lexical resources such asHowNet (Dong and Dong, 2000), SUMO andChinese WordNet (Huang et al, 2004), as wellas other synonym dictionaries from which wemight draw reference to build up our Pan-Chinese lexical resource.7 ConclusionIn this paper, we have investigated the regionalvariation of lexical items in two specific domainsfrom a synchronous Chinese corpus, and ex-plored their coverage in a Chinese synonym dic-tionary.
Results are encouraging in the sensethat 20-40% of the candidate words from varioussubcorpora are unique to the individual commu-nities, and as much as 70% of such unique itemsare not yet covered in the Tongyici Cilin.
Ittherefore suggests great importance and potentialfor a Pan-Chinese lexical resource which we aimto construct.
The synchronous corpus is a valu-able resource for mining the region-specificexpressions while existing synonym dictionariesmight provide a ready-made semantic classifica-tory structure.
Our next step would be to exploreautomatic means for extracting related lexicalitems from the corpus, and to incorporate theminto existing semantic classifications.AcknowledgementsThis work is supported by Competitive Ear-marked Research Grant (CERG) of the ResearchGrants Council of Hong Kong under grant No.CityU1317/03H.
