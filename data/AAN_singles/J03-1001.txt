Wang?City University of Hong KongUniversity of California at BerkeleyIn this study, optimization models using genetic algorithms (GAs) are proposed to study theconfiguration of vowels and tone systems.
As in previous explanatory models that have beenused to study vowel systems, certain criteria, which are assumed to be the principles governingthe structure of sound systems, are used to predict optimal vowels and tone systems.
In mostof the earlier studies only one criterion has been considered.
When two criteria are considered,they are often combined into one scalar function.
The GA model proposed for the study of tonesystems uses a Pareto ranking method that is highly applicable for dealing with optimizationproblems having multiple criteria.
For optimization of tone systems, perceptual contrast andmarkedness complexity are considered simultaneously.
Although the consistency between thepredicted systems and the observed systems is not as significant as those obtained for vowelsystems, further investigation along this line is promising.1.
IntroductionStudies of the universal characteristics of sound systems in human languages can bepursued according to two different approaches, an inductive approach and a deductiveone.
The inductive approach involves analyzing the database built from a survey ofa large number of languages to arrive at a list of ?universal?
features that can bewidely observed in the database.
The deductive approach hypothesizes a number ofprinciples related to speech production and perception processes and predicts possiblesystems using these principles.
These two approaches, however, are often interwoven.The principles hypothesized by the deductive approach are modified or falsified bycomparing the predictions with the results from the inductive analysis of real languagesystems.
At the same time, the ultimate aim for inductive analysis is to seek intrinsicmechanisms and principles of human speech to explain the universals found in realsystems.For the inductive approach in phonological studies, there are two large-scaledatabases available.
One is the Stanford Phonology Archiving (SPA) Project (Vihman1977), which initially included 196 languages and was extended to 209 languages in?

The other is the Phonological Segment Inventory Database (UPSID) (Maddieson1984) at the University of California at Los Angeles, which initially included 371 lan-guages and was later extended to 451 languages (Maddieson and Precoda 1990; Lade-foged and Maddieson 1996).
Many typological studies have been carried out based onthese two databases.
For example, in studying vowel systems, Crothers (1978) reportedan analysis using the SPA database.
Ladefoged and Maddieson (1990) and Schwartzet al (1997b) reported comprehensive analyses for the vowels systems in UPSID.Along with typological studies of the languages in these databases, explanatorymodels, which attempt to explore the intrinsic reasons for structures and universals,have also been proposed.
In the study of vowel systems, the principle of maximal per-ceptual contrast has a long tradition in linguistics (Jakobson 1941; Wang 1968).
Thisprinciple suggests that a vowel system tends to achieve a maximum contrast among thevowels in the system.
A number of numerical studies adopting this principle have beenproposed (Liljencrants and Lindblom 1972; Crothers 1978; Lindblom 1986).
Lindblom(1986) proposed the sufficient perceptual contrast principle, under which more sys-tems are predicted to be consistent with natural systems than is predicted by the max-imal perceptual contrast principle.
Boe?, Schwartz, and Valle?e (1994) and Schwartz etal.
(1997a) added a new consideration called the focalization principle that is based onthe observation that vowels with strong formant convergence would be perceptuallypreferred.
More recently, de Boer (1997, 2000, 2001) proposed a synthesized model inwhich agents interact with each other through iterative imitation games.
With explicitoptimization, agents can develop coherent vowel systems that are close to real systems.All of the works cited above are concerned with vowel systems.
Far fewer studiesare reported on other components of a sound system, including consonants, tones (intone languages), and pitch accent (in non?tone languages), than on vowels.
Lindblomand Maddieson (1988) reported a study on phonetic universals in consonant systemsusing data from UPSID.
They proposed that the structure of consonant systems doesnot arise from a single principle such as the maximization of perceptual contrast.
In-stead, articulatory factors interact with perceptual factors.
According to their proposal,consonant inventories tend to evolve so as to achieve maximal perceptual distinctive-ness at minimum articulatory cost.There are some inductive studies on the universals of tone systems as well.
Forexample, Maddieson (1978) reviewed the phonological universals of tones by analyz-ing data from SPA.
Also, Cheng (1973) reported a detailed analysis of the tone systemsin Chinese dialects.
We have not, however, found any explanatory models that applya deductive approach for tone systems in the way that such an approach has beenapplied for vowel systems.More recently, Redford, Chen, and Miikkulainen (2001) reported their studies onthe universal and variations of syllable structures (i.e., the combinations of vowelsand consonants).
They developed a computational model based on a version of thegenetic algorithm (GA) (Holland 1975) to simulate the emergence of syllable systemsin a language.
A set of functional constraints related to perceptual distinctiveness andarticulatory ease are taken into account as optimization objectives.In this study, we report some optimization models using GAs to study optimalvowel and tone systems.
In these models, the optimal systems are derived from themodels based on various explicit optimization criteria and compared with observedsystems.
First, in the study of vowel systems, we compare two sets of criteria, oneconsidering only the principle of maximal perceptual contrast (Liljencrants and Lind-blom 1972), and the other considering both the intervowel perceptual distance and theintravowel spectral salience, that is, the dispersion-focalization principle proposed bySchwartz et al (1997a).
In the second set of criteria, the two objectives, that is, inter-3Ke, Ogura, and Wang Optimization Models of Sound Systems Using GAvowel perceptual distance and the intravowel spectral salience, are combined into ascalar function.
In comparing our results with those of earlier studies, we find that theGA models demonstrate the effectiveness of the GA method in identifying the optimalvowel systems based on the above criteria.Second, we apply the GA method to study tone systems.
In our application, twoobjectives (maximum perceptual contrast and minimum markedness complexity) aretaken into account to predict the ?optimal?
tone systems.
Instead of combining thetwo objectives into one fitness function, we use a multi-objective GA (MOGA) modelin which a Pareto ranking method is applied for the fitness function.
For comparison,we also try a simple GA model that uses only perceptual distance as the optimizationcriterion.
The predicted systems are compared with the real systems for the two setsof criteria.In the following parts of the article, Section 2 gives a brief introduction to a simpleGA and a MOGA.
Section 3 reports the simulation we performed for vowel systemsand comparisons with previous reports.
Section 4 introduces our models for tone sys-tems, together with a new analysis of an available tone systems database.
Conclusionsand discussion are given in Section 5.2.
Introduction to Genetic Algorithms2.1 Simple Genetic AlgorithmGAs were first proposed by John Holland in the 1960s (Holland 1975) and have becomewidely used in various disciplines.
The original goal of Holland?s GAs was to study thephenomena of adaptation formally by importing the mechanisms of natural adaptationinto computer simulation models.
Most of the current applications of GAs, however,are used for specific optimization problems in which the focus is on the derivation ofoptimal solutions to the problem rather than the process of adaptation.The basic idea of GAs is based on ?natural selection,?
the principle of ?survivalof the fittest,?
which assumes that the individual that is better fitted to a particularenvironment produces more offspring than others in that environment that are lesswell suited for it; its ?fit?
genes are then transmitted to the next generation.
A GAoperates on a population of chromosomes, each generating a potential solution tothe studied problem.
The process of a traditional simple GA is as follows: At thebeginning of the algorithm, a population is randomly initialized, and the fitness ofeach chromosome is evaluated according to an objective function (also called a fitnessfunction).
A number of chromosomes are selected as parents from the populationaccording to their fitness, and parents then undergo crossover and mutation to produceoffspring with certain probabilities.
Offspring with better fitness are then inserted intothe population, replacing the inferior chromosomes in the previous generation.
Withthis replacement, usually the population size is kept constant.
This cycle is repeatedfor a given number of generations, or stopped when a solution obtained is deemedoptimal.
This process leads to the evolution of a population in which the individualsare more and more suited to their environment, just as in natural adaptation.
Becauseof its global search mechanism, a GA model usually can find global optimal solutionsin a more efficient way than traditional optimization methods.2.2 Multi-objective Genetic AlgorithmIn a traditional GA, the fitness function deals only with one optimization objective.Many practical problems, however, are concerned with several equally important (andusually conflicting) objectives.
These types of problems are called multi-objective ormulticriteria optimization problems (MOPs) (Stadler 1988).4Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 1Human language is an instance of an MOP.
A language system is constrained bymany demands and requirements.
We can consider the current language system to bethe product of an optimization process based on such constraints.
The constraints canbe divided mainly into three categories?the speaker constraint, the listener constraint,and the learner constraint?which often lead to different directions of development forthe system.
For example, for a sound system, the requirements that arise from speakingand listening often conflict with each other.
A sound that is easy for a speaker toproduce may not be easy for the listener to perceive.
Similarly, perceptually distinctivesounds may be difficult to pronounce.
A system with a high perceptual contrast mayhave a high production cost at the same time, as is the case with the consonant set[ k?
ts  m r ] suggested by Ohala in questioning the effectiveness of the principleof maximum perceptual difference in explaining consonant universals (Lindblom andMaddieson 1988).We can see the effects of such a tug-of-war between conflicting requirements invarious aspects of a language system.
For example, in the perception of tones, a com-pletely level tone is the easiest, from a psychophysical viewpoint, to differentiate fromnonlevel tones.
It requires much effort on the part of a speaker, however, to produce aperfectly level tone.
As a consequence of accommodating a speaker?s effort, the listen-ers will shift their linguistic perception boundary between level and rising tones awayfrom the psychophysical boundary, to allow the speaker some freedom in articulation(Wang 1976).Also, in syntax, a language with free word order may give the speaker a highdegree of flexibility in constructing sentences; however, it places the burden on thelistener to figure out the relationships among the words.
This is solved by signalingthe roles of words by various case markers.
If the case marking system is too complex,however, it will be hard for children to learn as they acquire the language.
Thereforethere may exist a balance point among the three different constraints involved.The most distinctive characteristic of an MOP is that it does not have one singularoptimal solution, but rather a set of nondominated,1 alternative solutions, which isoften called the Pareto-optimal set.
Recently a set of algorithms, called multi-objectivegenetic algorithms, have been developed specifically to solve such multi-objectiveproblems.
MOGAs have received much attention, and many scientific and engineer-ing applications employing them have been reported (Fonseca and Fleming 1998; VanVeldhuizen and Lamont 2000).The simplest and most common way to tackle an MOP is to combine its severalobjectives into one scalar function as the fitness function.
Different objectives in theproblem are given different weights based on some a priori knowledge (Stadler 1988).
(Early studies on sound system optimization with multiple criteria, such as Redford,Chen, and Miikkulainen [2001] and Schwartz et al [1997a], adopted this approach.
)Such knowledge is very often unavailable, however, and most of the time the weightsare chosen by trial and error.
Thus the performance of the algorithm usually is sensitiveto or biased by the weights assigned to the objectives.Within the GA approach, another method called Pareto ranking is often used inthe fitness evaluation.
The several objective values of a particular chromosome aremaintained as a vector, instead of being combined by means of a scalar function intoone single fitness value.
The fitness of a chromosome is determined by its ranking1 Assuming a minimization problem with p objectives, dominance is defined as follows: x1 is said todominate x2 (or x2 to be inferior to x1), if the fitness of x1, f (x1), is partially less than the fitness of x2,f (x2), that is, fi(x1) ?
fi(x2), ?i ?

A nondominatedsolution is a solution such that there are no other solutions whose objectives are all better than its.5Ke, Ogura, and Wang Optimization Models of Sound Systems Using GAA(1)C(1)B(1)E(2)F(2)G(3)f2 D(1)f1Figure 1An illustration of Goldberg?s Pareto ranking method.

There are many methods for ranking the objective vectors of chromosomes, andin this study we use the one proposed in Goldberg (1989).
Goldberg?s method assignsranks according to the following procedures.
First, the nondominated chromosomesfrom the whole population are found, rank 1 is assigned to them, and they are removedfrom further consideration in the ranking process.
Then, another set of chromosomesis found from the remaining population that is now nondominated (because of theremoval of those assigned rank 1) and is assigned rank 2, and so forth.
To illustrate thealgorithm, Figure 1 gives an example.
Points A, B, C, D, E, F, and G represent candidatesolutions to a problem whose goal is to minimize two objectives.
The objective valuesof the solutions are shown in the f1-f2 plane.
According to Goldberg?s method, solutionsA, B, C, and D are all nondominated and therefore assigned rank 1 and removed.Solutions E and F are now nondominated, so both have rank 2; G has rank 3, theworst rank.3.
Optimization Model for Vowel SystemsIn this study, we use a simple GA model to search for the optimal configuration ofsystems of simple vowels.
We apply various optimization criteria proposed by earlierstudies (Liljencrants and Lindblom 1972; Lindblom 1986; Schwartz et al 1997a) inour GA model and compare the predictions produced under the various criteria.
Wealso use two sets of vowel inventories to provide another type of comparisons.
Thepredictions are also compared with observed systems.3.1 Implementation of the GA ModelThe GA model consists of a population with a number of chromosomes, each repre-senting a possible vowel system.
Each vowel is encoded according to the three pri-mary parameters of vowel articulation, that is, tongue height, tongue backness, andlip roundness.
The first two articulatory parameters are supposed to be continuouswithin the range of [0,1], whereas the last parameter is a binary value.
Though thisencoding method allows an infinite number of vowels, following previous studies(Lindblom 1986; Schwartz et al 1997a), we assume there is a limited inventory of pro-totypes from which the system can select candidate vowels.
Only normal plain vowelsare considered.
The encoding of the prototypical vowels is designed according to the6Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 1Figure 2The F1 and F?2 diagram of prototypical vowels.

position as shown in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) vowel chart.Although the IPA vowel chart is better interpreted as an acoustic chart than as anaccurate projection of the real articulation of vowels, the chart can still be assumed toreflect the relative positions of different vowels for articulation.Two inventories of vowel prototypes are used, denoted as INVL and INVS, respec-tively.
The former consists of 18 vowels from a set of 19 vowels given in Lindblom(1986).2 The latter set includes 24 vowels extracted from the set of 33 vowels givenin Schwartz et al (1997a).
Figure 2 shows the two inventories in terms of the vowels?first formants (F1) and transformed second formants (F?2) (Fant 1966) (see Section 3.2for further explanation), both expressed in terms of the Bark scale (Hartmann 1997).In the GA model, one-point crossover and one-point mutation are used.
Take thesimulation of three-vowel systems as an example.
Two chromosomes are selected fromthe population as parents, as shown in Figure 3.
Parent 1 includes three vowels: , ?,and ?, represented by [0.0 0.5 1], [0.3 0.1 1], and [0.7 0.2 0], respectively.
And the threevowels , , and  are included in parent 2, represented by [0.0 1.0 0], [0.5 0.5 0],and [1.0 1.0 0], respectively.
Crossover is randomly chosen to take place between twovowels, say, the second and the third vowel in the example, and the two chromosomesexchange their vowels.
Next, at random, a mutation occurs in the third vowel in thesecond offspring: [?]
is changed to [?].
So the two offspring generated from the pairof parents are [, ?, ] and [, , ?
].2 The original inrounding front vowel [y] is deleted, as it is not a common primary vowel, and theoutrounding [u?]
is changed to symbol [y] to conform with the IPA transcription.7Ke, Ogura, and Wang Optimization Models of Sound Systems Using GAThe crossover and mutation rates are both set to 1.0 in order to give GA a highefficiency in searching for the optimal solution.
If the genetic operations generate anoffspring with the same vowel occurring more than once in a system, this offspring isremoved from the population, and a new chromosome is randomly generated.
Theseoffspring with higher levels of fitness than those that have been removed are theninserted into the population to keep the population size constant.3.2 Fitness Evaluation FunctionsTwo sets of criteria are taken into account in evaluating fitness of the candidate vowelsystem.
One considers only the principle of maximal perceptual contrast (Liljencrantsand Lindblom 1972), and the other considers both the intervowel perceptual distanceand the intravowel spectral salience related to the proximity of formants (i.e., thedispersion-focalization principle proposed by Schwartz et al [1997a]).For the first criterion, the objective is to minimize the following fitness function:F1 =n?1?i=1n?j=i+11d2ij(1)where dij is the perceptual distance between vowels i and j.
Various metrics for cal-culating perceptual distance between vowels have been proposed based on percep-tual experiments manipulating different combinations of formants and amplitudes ofspeech signals (Schwartz et al 1997a).
Usually the acoustic parameters, that is, thehigher formants (F2, F3, and F4), are first combined and transformed into an ?equiva-lent second formant?
F?2, and the auditory distance between two vowels is calculated asthe weighted Euclidean distance in the space of F1 and F?2, where the weight betweenF1 and F?2 is determined by ?
:dij =?

F?2j)2 (2)In this study, two methods of calculating F?2 are tried, one proposed in Fant (1966),and one given in Schwartz et al (1997a), to examine the effect of different metrics ofcalculating perceptual contrast.
Therefore, we will have two fitness functions regardingthe first criterion, perceptual contrast, denoted as F1F and F1S, with the latter basedon Schwartz?s method and the former based on Fant?s.The second criterion includes another objective in addition to the above F1, theintravowel formant convergence:Fc =n?i=1?1(F2i ?

F2i)2+n?i=1?1(F4i ?

and ?
are crucial for the prediction.

0.09 and 0 ?

0.4.
In our experiments, wechoose the values ?
= 0.0625 and ?
= 0.3, which are within the above ranges.3 Note that the ?
in our formula 2 corresponds to ?2 in Schwartz et al (1997a); the range of ?
istherefore modified accordingly.8Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 1Table 1Frequent vowel systems in UPSID and predicted vowel systems using different inventoriesand fitness functions.N Observed systems Predicted systemsINVS INVL3 [i, a, u](14)F1F:F1S:F2:S0:[i, a, u][i, a, u][i, a, u][i, a, u][i, a, u][i, a, u][i, a, u]4[i, ?e?, a, u](14)[i, a, u, ](5)[i, a, ?o?, u](2)[e, a, o,](2)F1F:F1S:F2:S0:[i, ?, a, u][i, ?, a, u][i, ?e?, a, u][i, ?e?, a, u][i, ?, a, u][i, ?, a, u][i, ?, a, u]5 [i, ?e?, a, ?o?, u](97)[i, ?, a, u, ](3)F1F:F1S:F2:S0:[i, ?, a, ?o?, u][i, ?, a, ?o?, u][i, ?, a, ?o?, u][i, ?e?, a, ?o?, u][i, ?, a, 	, u][i, ?, a, 	, u][i, ?, a, 	, u]6[i, ?e?, a, ?o?, u, ](26)[i, ?e?, a, ?o?, u, ](12)[i, ?e?, ?, , ?o?, u](12)[i,e, a, 	, o, u](4)F1F:F1S:F2:S0:[i, e, ?, a, ?o?, u][i, e, ?, a, o, u][i, e, ?, a, ?o?, u][i, ?, a, ?o?, u, ][i, ?, a, 	,u, ][i, ?, a, 	, u, ?

The predicted systems arelisted in Table 1, together with the commonly observed systems found in the UPSIDdatabase, as given in Schwartz et al (1997a), and the predictions given in Schwartz etal.
(1997a) using the same parameters as those for F2 here (listed as S0).First, we compare the predictions resulting from experiments using the same vowelinventory but different fitness functions.
The two perceptual distance metrics (F1F andF1S) produce the same predictions for systems of small sizes (i.e., three-, four- andfive-vowel systems), but different predictions for larger systems (i.e., six- and seven-vowel systems), which means that predictions for larger systems are more sensitive tothe transformation of F?2.
That transformation used in Schwartz et al (1997a) producesa more spread perceptual space in the F?2 dimension, and especially [i] has a muchlarger F?2 than Fant?s transformation.
It is hard to give an overall evaluation of whichperceptual distance metric gives better predictions based on the results we obtained.F1S predicts a symmetric six-vowel system, whereas F1F does not, when INVS is usedas the vowel inventory; when INVL is used as the vowel inventory, however, F1Spredicts a strange six-vowel system with a front rounded vowel ?
that is rarely attestedin primary vowel systems, whereas F1F predicts a system close to the second frequentobserved system in natural languages.From the comparison of the two fitness functions F1S and F2, we can see thatthe predictions they make in most cases are the same.
There are some exceptions(i.e.
in those experiments using INVS in four-, six- and seven-vowel systems and in9Ke, Ogura, and Wang Optimization Models of Sound Systems Using GAthose using INVL in six-vowel systems).
Predictions given by F2 differ from thosegiven by F1S only in some small variations between ?
and ?e?, ?o?
and o, 	 and ?o?.
F2does not predict more nonperipheral vowels than F1S, inconsistent with the proposalof Schwartz et al (1997a), although the parameters are set within the optimal rangesuggested by them.
The discrepancies between our results and Schwartz et al (1997a)may need further examination, because our experiment using the same F2 and INVSas those in Schwartz et al (1997a) produced different predictions of optimal five-, six-and seven-vowel systems than those they reported (reproduced as the list of S0 in thetable), given ?
= 0.0625 and ?
= 0.3.
When ?
is set to 0.09 for the five-vowel system,however, and when ?
= 0.025 and ?
= 0.1 for the six-vowel system, the predictionsare the same as those in Schwartz et al (1997a).Second, we compare predictions resulting from experiments employing the samefitness function but different inventories.
Though the original data set from whichINVS is selected is said to be carefully controlled to sample the acoustic space asevenly as possible (Schwartz et al 1997a), we do not see much difference betweenINVS and INVL for predicting small-sized systems.
If we consider the vowel ?
inLindblom?s inventory to be equivalent to the vowel ?e?
in Schwartz et al (1997a), 	 tobe equivalent to ?o?, and  to be equivalent to , then the predictions resulting fromthe two inventories are almost the same.
This is not surprising, since we can see fromFigure 2 that the peripheral vowels in the two vowel inventories are almost the same inthe F1-F?2 plane.
However, for the six-vowel system produced in combination with anyof the three fitness functions and the seven-vowel systems produced in combinationwith the first fitness function (F1F), there are some big differences between the twovowel inventories.
This may be mainly because the nonlow unrounded back vowelsare much farther away from rounded back vowels in INVS than in INVL.Comparing the predicted systems with the observed systems, we find that onlythe most frequently observed three- and four-vowel systems are predicted, and thatother predictions do not match the observed systems.
The reasons for these resultsmay include the following: First, the vowel inventories, especially INVL, do not pro-vide enough prototypes for predicting vowel systems, such as ?e?
and ?o?, which arenot included in INVL; second, the perceptual distance metric used in the study mayhave not perfectly reflected the actual human perception mechanism; and third, onlyone optimal system can be identified using the current simple GA model.
Furtherconsiderations of the optimization criteria for the GA model that include the sufficientperceptual contrast principle proposed by Lindblom (1986) instead of the maximalperceptual contrast principle may lead to more consistent predictions.
Also the centralvowel , which occurs often in large vowel systems, may call for another optimiza-tion criterion in addition to the current ones (Schwartz et al 1997a).
GA models arepromising in carrying out such investigations in which multiple optimization criteriaare addressed simultaneously.
The following study on the optimal tone systems issuch an experiment.4.
Optimization Model for Tone SystemsA tone language is a language having lexically contrastive pitch on each syllable (Pike1948).
Tone languages are found in many parts of the world (Wang 1991).
Thoughtone is as fundamental a constituent in tone languages as are vowels and consonants,to our knowledge, there has been no explanatory or numerical model proposed toenable studies of the universal structure of tone systems comparable to those beingconducted for vowel and consonant systems.
In this section, we extend the GA modelsreported above for vowel systems to study the configuration of tone systems from the10Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 1Level5544332211Falling51534231Rising15352413535424313353242131Falling-rising Rising-fallingFigure 4Numeric and corresponding graphic representation of the 19 tones proposed in Gandour(1983).
Tones not found in Wang (1967) are underlined.optimization perspective.
Two different sets of criteria are investigated.
The first setconsiders only the perceptual contrast between tones, as in the study of vowel systemsin Section 3; the second takes both perceptual contrast and markedness complexity intoaccount.
The predicted systems are analyzed and compared with those reported fromempirical studies.4.1 Tone Inventory and Chromosome RepresentationIn a procedure similar to the one we used for the simulation of vowels, we first choosea tone inventory from which a system selects individual tones.
Wang (1967) suggested13 idealized tones in his study of the phonological features of tones, including fivelevel (11, 22, 33, 44, and 55), two rising (35 and 13), two falling (53 and 31), twofalling-rising (535 and 313), and two rising-falling (353 and 131).4 These 13 tones areconsidered to represent the maximum contrasts found between tones in any language.In a later tone perception experiment, Gandour (1983) used an extended set of 19tones, adding to Wang?s list two rising tones (15 and 24), two falling tones (51 and42), and two complex tones (424 and 242).
In this study, we take Gandour?s 19 tones,shown in Figure 4, as the inventory.In the model, a chromosome is represented by a number of tones, each of whichis selected from among the 19 tones of the inventory.
Each tone is described by threenumerals representing its shape.
The genetic operations and parameters are the sameas those in the vowel models.4.2 Fitness Evaluation Functions4.2.1 The First Objective.
It is assumed that tone systems tend to have a maximumperceptual contrast within the system, much like that proposed for vowel systems.
Asin the study of vowel systems, we need to derive a method to calculate the perceptualdistance between tones.
In this study, we use the experimental results from Gandour(1983) to develop such a metric to measure this perceptual distance.Gandour?s experiment was designed to investigate the perceptual dimension oftone and the effect of linguistic experience on a listener?s perception of tone.
Gandour4 Tones are represented according to Chao?s (1930) conventional five-level transcription system.11Ke, Ogura, and Wang Optimization Models of Sound Systems Using GA5335333445535535244241513313242111312242 51 31Dim 1Dim2Figure 5Dimensions 1 and 2 of the two-dimensional INDSCAL tone space (adapted from Gandour[1983]).synthesized speechlike monosyllables [wa] with the 19 types of tones superimposedon them.
Four groups of participants who were from four tone languages (Cantonese,Mandarin, Taiwanese, and Thai) and one group from a nontone language (English)made judgments about the degree of dissimilarity between paired stimulus tones.
Thecollected data were analyzed by an INDSCAL (individual differences scaling) model,and the perceived perceptual dissimilarity among the 19 tone types is presented in aperceptual space in Figure 5.
Using these results, we design a metric for calculatingthe perceptual distance between a pair of tones i and j as their Euclidean distance inthe perceptual plane:dij =?
(Dim1i ?
Dim1j)2 + (Dim2i ?
Dim2j)2 (5)where Dim1i and Dim2i represent the two coordinates of tone i in the perceptual plane.Similarly to the method used in the vowel systems, the perceptual contrast within atone system is measured by the total perceptual distance for all pairs of tones.
Thefitness function is therefore the same as the F1 given in Section 3.2.4.2.2 The Second Objective.
Following the first objective of considering perceptualcontrast, the second consideration would naturally be determining the cost of produc-ing various tones.
Various mechanisms for controlling the tension of vocal cords andsubglottal air pressure and their effect in regulating pitch change have been proposed(Ohala 1978).
Different laryngeal muscles, such as the cricothyroid, sternohyoid, andsternothyroid muscles, are found to perform various actions in raising or loweringvocal pitch.
An asymmetry is found in the maximum speed of rises as compared tofalls in pitch change, which suggests that falling tones may in some sense be easierto produce than rising tones (Collier 1984; Ohala 1978).
Level tones are found to beuniversally preferred to contour tones, and simple contour tones to complex contourtones (Maddieson 1978), which may be due to the different production cost of varioustypes of tones.
It is hard, however, to quantify these differences, and no systematicmeasurements have been made available yet.Because of the lack of data measuring the effort required to produce differenttones, we chose another criterion as the second objective: the markedness complexity,which is based on a study of phonological features of tones proposed in Wang (1967).Each tone is assigned a complexity value based on the analysis of tones with features12Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 1Table 2Relative complexity of tones as defined by marking conventions (adapted from Wang [1967]).55 11 44 22 33 35/15 13/24 53/51 31/42 535 313/424 353 131/242CONTOUR u u u u u m m m m m m m mHIGH + ?

In the table, ?m?
stands for the markedspecification, which is the favored specification, and ?u?
for unmarked.
As there isno empirical ground for favoring either +HIGH or ?HIGH, or RISING or FALLING,the features of [HIGH], [RISING] and [FALLING] are only analyzed by its presenceor not by assigning + or ?, instead of specifying their markedness.
We note that theassignment of + and ?
may need further justification or modification with regard toour discussion above on rising and falling tones.
In this study, however, we still adoptthis analysis presented in the table for our simulation.
The specifications ?m,?
?+,?
and???
each add one unit to the complexity of a particular tone, whereas ?u?
does not.Although we have maintained in Table 2 the original complexity assignment forthe 13 typical tones given in Wang (1967), we have incorporated the six additionaltones proposed by Gandour (1983).
It is assumed that tone pairs such as 35 and 15,13 and 24, 53 and 51, 31 and 42, 313 and 424, and 131 and 242 are of the samecomplexity.
As far as we are aware, there is no tone system having more than twofalling or rising contrasts that all provide lexical distinctions.
Those transcriptions oftone systems that do incorporate more than two rising or two falling tones may bedue to overdifferentiation within a single tone paradigm, as suggested in Wang (1967).Markedness is a method of representing the linguist?s knowledge of a phonolog-ical system.
This knowledge derives primarily from observations of three sorts: thefrequency of distribution of the sounds in the languages of the world, the patternsof historical change in sound systems, and the acquisition of sounds in children andthe dissolution of sounds in linguistic pathology.
Therefore the complexity assigned totones based on markedness may reflect an integrated effect of perception, production,and learnability.The two objectives, perceptual distance and markedness complexity, are takeninto account in a MOGA model using the Pareto ranking method, as introduced inSection 2.2, to predict optimal tone systems.
Simulation results are shown in Section 4.4.4.3 Empirical Data AnalysisBefore reporting the results of our simulation, we report our analysis of an availabledatabase of observed tone systems with which we can compare our predictions.
Toour knowledge, there is no large database for tone systems of the same scale as SPAor UPSID for vowel and consonant systems.
We have been able to find, however, acomputer database consisting of 737 entries from various dialect5 locations in China5 The ?dialects?
we used here are referred to as the various languages such as Mandarin, Cantonese,Min dialect, and Wu dialect.13Ke, Ogura, and Wang Optimization Models of Sound Systems Using GATable 3Frequencies of occurrence of the 19 tone types in the normalized Cheng database.Tone 31 53 55 42 35 24 313 44 33 13Frequency 326 294 291 281 262 248 241 219 185 167Tone 11 51 22 424 353 242 131 15 535Frequency 86 78 66 27 12 8 8 6 1Table 4Frequencies of occurrence and different sizes of tone system in both the original and thenormalized Cheng database.Size 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 TotalFrequency(original) 26 497 105 91 10 7 1 737Frequency(normalized) 22 448 86 79 4 2 641Types(normalized) 19 162 72 60 4 2 319compiled by Cheng (1973).
Some of the 737 entries are from the same location, butfrom different reports or at different times.
They are considered individual systemsin our analysis since they were obtained independently and we want to consider asmany systems as possible in our analysis, though it is possible that our analysis maybe contaminated by the unequal quality of the entries.To make comparison with predicted systems possible, we normalize nontypicaltones in Cheng?s database to the 19 typical ones.
For example, tones 54, 12, and 324are converted to 53, 13, and 313, respectively.
Such normalization also provides someadvantage in dealing with different types of transcription of the same system.
Veryoften different researchers have their own individual strategies of transcription, anddifferent informants employed for the same dialect also have individual differencesin their speech.
Therefore controversies often arise, such as whether a particular tonein Cantonese is 13 or 23.
By normalizing the tones in Cheng?s database into the 19typical tones, some such controversies will be resolved.
Table 3 shows the frequenciesof occurrence of the 19 types of tones in the normalized database.
When the changesin the database as a result of normalization create a situation in which the same toneoccurs more than once in one system, that system is excluded from the normalizeddatabase for further analysis.
The original database includes 737 systems with 606different tone types.
After normalization, there were 641 systems of 319 different tonetypes.
Table 4 shows the frequencies of different sizes of tone system in both theoriginal and the normalized database.
Systems with four tones are by far the mostfrequent type.Figure 6 shows the tone types occurring in the four-tone normalized systems.Frequencies of occurrence are indicated beside each tone.
We can see that tones areheavily clustered in three areas in the perceptual plane: the upper right (includingtones 42, 51, 31, 22, 11, 131) (cluster 1), the lower right (24, 13, 424, 313, 15) (cluster 2),and the middle left (55, 44, 35, 53, 33, 353, 242) (cluster 3).
Tone 535, although it doesnot occur in the normalized four-tone systems, can also be classified in cluster 3, asinferred from Figure 5.
When we calculate the frequencies of occurrence of tones inthese three areas for three-, four-, and five-tone systems, as shown in Table 5, we findthat most of the systems tend to select tones from each of the three individual clusters,14Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 1cluster 3cluster 2cluster 153(60)353(6)33(37)44(50)55(66)35(59)24(55)424(11)15(4)13(37)313(56)242(1)11(17)131(4)22(23)42(68)51(26)31(68)Figure 6Frequency of tone occurrence in observed four-tone systems shown in the perceptual space(total 162 systems).Table 5Number of tones in the three clusters in perceptual space and percentage of systems havingtones from each of the three clusters.Percentage ofsystems havingtones from eachNumber of Number of Number of Number of of the threesystems tones in C1 tones in C2 tones in C3 clustersThree-tone system 19 19 17 21 73.7Four-tone system 162 206 163 279 75.0Five-tone system 72 107 91 162 74.3rather than selecting tones from only one or two clusters.
The percentages of systemshaving tones from each of the three clusters are shown in the last column of Table 5.We can infer from the data in Table 5 that there tends to be a great deal of perceptualcontrast within the systems, since the tones from separate clusters often have largerperceptual distances between them than tones in the same cluster.
Furthermore, four-and five-tone systems do not employ tones from the three clusters evenly.
It is obviousthat cluster 2, which includes most of the rising tones (except high rising tone 35, whichis contoured in cluster 3), contributes fewer tones to four- and five-tone systems thanthe other two clusters.
This implies that rising tones are less preferred in the observedsystems.4.4 Simulation Results and Comparison with Observed SystemsTables 6, 7, and 8 give the predicted ?optimal?
three-, four- and five-tone systemsobtained from the GA model.
A number of tone systems that occur frequently inthe normalized database are also given in the tables for comparison.
The frequencieswith which the tone systems were observed in the normalized database are given inparentheses besides the tones.For a system of a given size, the model using only the first objective (maximalperceptual contrast) predicts only one optimal system, which is indicated with aster-isks in the tables.
This optimal system has the maximum perceptual contrast but thelargest markedness complexity.
On the other hand, the two-objective model predicts anumber of optimal systems besides the optimal one predicted by the single-objective15Ke, Ogura, and Wang Optimization Models of Sound Systems Using GATable 6Predicted optimal and frequent observed three-tone systems.Predicted systems Observed systemsPerceptual Complexity t1 t2 t3 Perceptual Complexity t1 t2 t3distance distance (frequency)*14.41 9 55 31 15 12.97 9 55 31 424(3)13.77 7 55 22 15 11.52 12 42 35 13(1)13.97 6 55 11 31 8.84 11 33 53 313(2)Table 7Predicted optimal and frequent observed four-tone systems.Predicted systems Observed systemsPerceptual Complexity t1 t2 t3 t4 Perceptual Complexity t1 t2 t3 t4distance distance (frequency)*24.63 12 55 11 31 15 22.42 14 44 53 31 13(21)24.55 10 55 11 31 15 22.02 13 55 42 31 24(27)23.67 9 44 22 11 15 21.98 13 55 53 31 24(17)23.24 8 55 44 11 13 21.03 13 55 51 35 313(20)Table 8Predicted optimal and frequent observed five-tone systems.Predicted systems Observed systemsPerceptual Complexity t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 Perceptual Complexity t1 t2 t3 t4 t5distance distance (frequency)*39.20 17 55 53 31 15 13 35.90 13 55 44 22 31 13(1)38.44 14 55 11 53 15 13 35.82 17 55 42 31 24 313(4)38.60 12 55 44 11 31 15 34.54 15 55 44 42 24 13(1)38.17 10 55 44 22 11 15 32.33 12 55 22 11 31 24(1)32.15 10 55 44 33 11 24(1)28.12 17 11 51 53 42 24(2)27.09 18 44 53 42 31 35(3)model.
These optimal systems, like the points A, B, C, and D shown in Figure 1, forma Pareto-optimal set.
They are equally good in terms of the overall fitness includingthe two objectives (large perceptual contrast and small markedness complexity).
Thetwo-objective model may be viewed as a possible implementation of the sufficientperceptual contrast proposed for the study of optimal vowel systems by Lindblom(1986).We can observe in the predicted systems characteristics similar to those in theobserved systems, particularly the uneven utilization of the three clusters in the per-ceptual space.
If we assume that tones within the same cluster are interchangeable,then we can see that most of the predicted optimal systems have corresponding ob-served systems, except one prediction for a three-tone system (55, 11, 31), which doesnot include a tone from cluster 2.The predicted systems seem to exploit more tones in the outer area of the per-ceptual space, such as 55, 11, 31, and 15, whereas in the observed systems, tones in16Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 1the relative inner area, such as 35, 53, 42, 24, and 313, are more frequent.
High risingtone 15 occurs often in predicted systems because of its high salience in the perceptualspace.
In the observed systems, however, tone 15 is very infrequent (only six occur-rences among the 641 systems observed).
In the observed systems, pairs of contrastingtones, such as 24 and 42, 13 and 31, occur quite often.
These contrasting pairs are notclear in our prediction.
Tone 31 co-occurs more frequently with tone 15 than with tone13, which again is due to the perceptual salience of tone 15.The observed systems include more tones close to the center of the perceptualspace, whereas the predicted systems prefer tones located in its periphery.
This patternis similar to one observed in a long-standing problem in the study of vowel systems(Liljencrants and Lindblom 1972).
In observed vowel systems, especially the largersystems, central vowels commonly occur (examples can be seen in Table 1), whereasthe proposed optimal vowel systems predict them only rarely.
The utilization of fewerperipheral areas in observed systems than in predicted ones suggests that the role ofmaximizing perception contrast in the models may need to be adjusted or that moreoptimization criteria in addition to the perceptual contrast and markedness complexityshould be added.Moreover, the markedness complexity we hypothesize is an abstract measure thatincorporates many factors, including perception and production.
Thus the considera-tion of perception contrast may have been duplicated in the fitness function.
This maybe another reason for the discrepancy mentioned in the preceding paragraph.
Whenmore empirical studies in the physiology of tone production are available, we mayconsider tone production as an individual objective in the fitness function, which wewould expect to allow better predictions.5.
Conclusions and DiscussionIn this article, we apply optimization models using GAs to study the configurationof vowels and tone systems.
The approach we use is similar to that in previous ex-planatory models that have been used to study vowel systems.
Certain criteria, whichare assumed to be the principles governing the structure of sound systems, are usedto predict optimal systems.
In most of the previous studies (Liljencrants and Lind-blom 1972; Crothers 1978; Lindblom 1986), only one criterion has been considered.When two criteria have been considered, the two objectives are combined into a sin-gle weighted function (Boe?, Schwartz, and Valle?e 1994).
In our study of vowel systems,the simple GA model we use also adopts a weighted function to combine two crite-ria, perceptual contrast and focalization.
In our study of tone systems, however, weapply a MOGA model that uses a Pareto ranking method to consider two criteria,perceptual contrast and markedness complexity, simultaneously, without combiningthem into a scalar function.
A priori knowledge of the weights of the two criteria arenot necessary.Another advantage of an MOGA is that we can obtain a set of Pareto-optimalresults, instead of only one.
An MOGA model generates more optimal predictionsthan a single-objective model, and therefore it is more likely to predict more systemsthat are close to the systems actually observed.
Although the consistency betweenthe predicted systems and the observed systems in the current study is not as sig-nificant as that obtained for vowel systems, further investigation along this line ispromising.Following the deductive approach pursued in this study, we can design variouscriteria to predict optimal systems.
The deductive approach provides convenience andfreedom in the manipulation of different parameters in the models, such as the param-17Ke, Ogura, and Wang Optimization Models of Sound Systems Using GAeters ?
and ?
in Schwartz et al (1997a), to test different hypothesized mechanisms.
It isnecessary, however, to seek explanations for such parameters in terms of physiologicalor cognitive constraints.Studies taking the deductive approach must not be pursued independent of theinductive approach.
For example, in the study of tone systems, few comprehensivetone databases are available.
The resources on which our investigation of tone sys-tems relies, including the experiment in Gandour (1983) and the database in Cheng(1973), are based mostly on the observation of tone languages found in Asian.
Theincorporation of data from other types of tone languages in Africa and America isexpected to help in refining our explanatory hypothesis about the configuration of thesystems.Lastly, we would like to point out that although in this study we apply optimiza-tion to predict vowel and tone systems, we do not imply that there exist any explicitand/or global optimization processes in the formation of such systems.
We have nogrounds to believe that speakers are aware of what sounds will provide maximal per-ceptual contrast or require the least production effort and therefore deliberately choosethose sounds.
Optimization must be an emergent property from the interactions of lan-guage users (de Boer 2000, 2001).
Each individual speaker has certain physiologicaland cognitive constraints which limit the sounds it is possible for him to make andassign preference to certain of those sounds over others.
These constraints, however,provide only a range of possible sounds.
It is the interactions among individuals thatdetermine precisely which systems among those that are possible will emerge.
This iswhy different configurations of sound systems, even suboptimal ones in the sense ofsome hypothesized criteria, can be observed in real systems.
Research including mod-eling from this perspective is promising and may lead to more realistic predictions ofsound systems.AcknowledgmentsThis research is supported in part by twogrants from the City University of HongKong, nos.
