"*~Trans fer  Apprpach to Machine TranslationWe are currently restricting the domain oftranslation to abstract papers in scientific andtechnological, fields.
The system is based on atransfer approach and consists of three phases;analysis, transfer and generation.In the first phase, morphological analysisdivides sentence into lexical items, then syntacticanalysis is carried out by syntactic and semanticanalyses of' Case Grammar in Japanese.
In the secondt rans fer  phase, lex ica l  features  are t rans fer red  andat, the seine time, the syntact i c  s t ruc tures  aretransferred by maldn{,; them match tree patternsbetween Japanese and English, Here, we use semanticfeatures  Lo se lec t  words for  t rans la t ion  intoEngl ish.

Concept of a.
Dependency Structure baaed onCase Grammar in Japanese;In Japan, we \[lave come to the cone\] usion thatcase grammar is the most effective one for" Japanesesyntactic analysis in machine translation systems.This type of grammar has been proposed and studied byJapanese linguists before Fillmore's presentation.As the word order" is heavily restricted inF~iglish syntax, ATNG(Au~nented Transition NetworkGrammar) based on CFG(Context Free Grammar) isadequate for syntactic; analysis.
However, Japaneseword order is almost unrestricted and Kok~j_q ,~hi(postpositonal case particle) play an important roleas deep eases in Japanese sentences.
Therefore, casegrammar is the most effective method for Japanese* This project was carried out with the aid of a special grant for the pronlotion of science and technologyfrom the ~-ience and Technology Agency of the Japanese Government.13syntactic and semantic analyses.In Japanese syntactic structure, the word orderi s  unres t r i c ted  except for  p red icates (verbs  or verbphrases)  which w i l l  be located  a t  the  end o fsentences .

We set  up fourconcepts  :in he ighest  leve l  ; "Concrete ob jec ts" ,"Abst rac t  concepts" ,  "Phenomena", and "llumanactions".
Concrete  ob jec ts  are  the selfsame objectsin the world.
Abstract concepts are the standardswhich fix intellectual activities of hunlankind.Phenomena include both social, phenomena and naturalphenonlena.
\[\[unlan ac t ions  a re  the  se l f same acted  byhumans.

cateqorya facet \[facet nameFigure 5, I Relationship between Facet and~em_ant ie Mm:kerN2)  SubclassJfication of  FacetsFacets, for example, were subclassified intoslots as follows, the facet of Animate objects wassubclassified as semantic slots ?humans", "animals ~ ,and "plants ?
The facet of Phenomena wassubelassified as slots "natural phenomena", "physicalphenomena ?
, "power and energies", "physiologicalphenomena", ?soc ia l  phenomena ?
and "soc ia l  systemsand customs'.
We then set up an "others" slot in eachfacet, for these words which cannot he assigned toany slot.
The use of these slots is explained insection 5.3.
We will study "others" slots throughsemantic analysis for nouns; new slots or facets mayhave to be assigned.These semantic slots and facets are namedsemant ic  markers .
The System of Semant ic  Markers forNouns i s  shown in f igure  5.2.
The system of semant icmarkers  for  nouns i s  made up of  13 conceptua l  facetsinc lud ing  ~Others ?
markers ,  and 49 f i i i a l  s lo ts  asterm i nal  s.We a l so  use Special.
Semant ic  Markers for" funct iona l  words" which represent  some pat terns ,syntact i c  or semant ic  in fo rmat ion .
For exmnple, theword "comparison" presupposes  more than twonouns(arguments ) ;  compar i son  between "A" and "B ?
.Then, "WK(Relation)" as a spec ia l  semant ic  marker i sa t tached  to the word ?compar ison".
The word "t ime ?assumes time case.
These features suggest  aneffective dev ice  for semantic analysis.5.2  Concept e f  ~mant .

The f i r s t  problemi s  s imple mistakes made by humans.
The second problemi s  a f luc tuat ion  of semantic ana lys i s  due to a largeamount of  data.
So i t  i s  necessary to develop anautomatic marking system to save time and to improveefficiency.P) When assigning semantic markers to nouns, weattached them without considering the relationshipbetween nouns and verbs.
That is, we attachedsemantic markers simply based on noun concepts.
Thisis not adequate to handle nouns which areintrinsically related to verbs.
One of the solutionsto this problem will be to study the correlationmatrix of the semantic markers for nouns in relationto the case frame of verbs.3) Our system of semantic markers for nouns hasbeen designed for Japanese nouns.
We have to design asyst~, of semantic mgrkers for English nouns.
Sincerecognition for its concept in an Enlish word is verydifficult for the Japanese, we are also studying amethod of evaluation test to handle these data.4) Our system of semantic markers for nounssimply consists of the tree structure of facets andslots.
Subclassification for these structures withdeep tree structure is a significant problem in orderto analyze the concept of nouns more in detail, butsuch a semantic marking operation will bec~ne morec~nplex and difficult for I), 2) problems.5) We suppose that a concept system for words isnot a static structure, but various semantic networksconstructed dynamically according to a given sUory.We must give thorough consideration to thisprospective problems.~efereBces!n  Enfl tLsh(1) Sakamoto, Y., SaLoh, M. and Ishikawa, T.:Lexicon Features for Japanese Syntactic Analysis inMu .Project JE, COTING84, Stanford, 1984.
