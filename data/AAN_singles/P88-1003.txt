MULTI-LEVEL PLURALS AND DISTRIBUTIVITYRemko Scha and David StallardBBN Laboratories Inc.10 Moulton St.Cambridge, MA 02238U.S.A.ABSTRACTWe present a computational treatment of thesemantics of plural Noun Phrases which extends anearlier approach presented by Scha \[7\] to be able todeal with multiple-level plurals ("the boys and thegirls", "the juries and the committees", etc.)
1 We ar-gue that the arbitrary depth to which such plural struc-tures can be nested creates a correspondingly ar-bitrary ambiguity in the possibilities for the distributionof verbs over such NPs.
We present a recursivetranslation rule scheme which accounts for this am-biguity, and in particular show how it allows for theoption of "partial distributivity" that collective verbshave when applied to such plural Noun Phrases.1 INTRODUCTIONSyntactically parallel utterances which containplural noun phrases often require entirely differentsemantic treatments depending upon the particularverbs (or adjectives or prepositions) that these pluralNPs are combined with.
For example, while the sen-tence "The boys walk" would have truth-conditions ex-pressed by: 2Vxe  BOYS: WALK\[x\]the very similar sentence "The boys gather" could notbe translated this way.
Its truth-conditions would in*stead have to be expressed by something like:GATHER\[BOYS\]since only a group can "gather', not one person byhimself.It is common to call a verb such as "walk" a"distributive" verb, while a verb such as "gather" (or"disperse ~ or intransitive "meet*) is called a~The wod( presented here was supported unOer DARPA contracts#N00014-85-C-0016 and #N00014-87.C-0085.

The collective/distributive distinctionraises an important issue: how to treat the semanticsof plural NPs uniformly.An eadiar paper by Scha ("Distributive, Collectiveand Cumulative Quantification" \[7\], hereinafter "DCC")presented a formal treatment of this issue which ex-ploits an idea about the semantics of plural NP'swhich is due to Bartsch \[1\]: plural NP's are a lwaysinterpreted as quantifying over sets rather than in-dividuals; verbs are correspondingly always treated ascollective predicates applying to sets.
Distributiveverbs are provided with meaning postulates which re-late such collective applications to applications on theconstituent individuals.The present paper describes an improved and ex-tended version of this approach.
Two importantproblems are addressed.
First, there is the problemof ambiguity: the need to allow for more than onedistribution pattern for the same verb.
Second, thereis the problem of "multi-level plurality': the con-sequences which arise for the distributive/collectivedistinction when one considers conjoined plural NPssuch as "The boys and the girls".Both issues are addressed by a two-level systemof semantic interpretation where the first level dealswith the semantic consequences of syntactic structureand the second with the lexically specific details ofdistribution.The treatment of plural NPs described in thispaper has been implemented in the Spoken Lan-guage System which is being developed at BBN.
Thesystem provides a natural language interface to adatabase/graphic display system which is used to ac-cess information about the capabilities and readinessconditions of the ships in the Pacific Reet of the USNavy.The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-lows:Section 2 discusses previous methods of handlingthe distributive/collective distinction, and shows theirlimitations in dealing with the problems mentionedabove.Section 3 presents our two-level semantics ap-proach, and shows how it handles the problem of am-biguity.17Section 4 shows how a further addition to the two-level system - recursive enumeration of lexical mean-ings - handles the multi-level plural problem.Section 5 presents the algorithm that is used andSection 6 presents conclusions.2BACKGROUND2.1 An Approach  to Dist r ibut iv i tyOne possible way to generate the correct readingsfor "The boys walk" vs. "The boys gather" is due toBennett \[2\].
Verbs are sub-categorized as either col-lective or distributive.
Noun phrases consisting of"the" + plural then have two readings; a *sat" readingif they are combined with a collective verb and auniversal quantification reading if they are combinedwith a distributive verb.Scha's "Distributive, Collective, and CumulativeQuantification" ('DCC') showed that this approach,while plausible for intransitive verbs, breaks down forthe two-argument case of transitive verbs \[7\].
Con-sider the example below:"The squares contain the circles"\[3This sentence has a reading which can be ap-proximately paraphrased as "Every circle is containedin some square" so that in the world depicted abovethe sentence would be considered true.The truth-conditions which Bennett's approachwould predict, however, are expressed by the formula:Vx e SQUARES: V.R CIRCLES: CONTAIN\[x,y\]which obviously does not correspond to the state ofaffairs pictured above.
"DCC" avoids this problem by not generating adistributive translation directly.
Noun phrases, regard-less of number, quantify over sets of individuals: asingular noun phrase simply quantifies over asingleton set.
Nouns by themselves denote sets ofsuch singleton sets.
Thus, both "square" and"squares" are translated as:SQUARES*in which the asterisk operator "*" creates the set ofsingleton subsets of "SQUARES'.Verbs can now be uniformly typed to accept setsof individuals as their arguments.
Thecollective/distributive distinction consists solely inwhether a verb is applied to a large set or to asingleton set.Determiner translations are either distributive orcollective depending upon whether they apply thepredicate to ,the constituent singletons or to theirunion.
Some determiners are unambiguously distribu-tive, for example the translation for "each':(;~X: (~.P.
Vx E x: P(x)))Other determiners - "all', "some" and "three" - areambiguous between translations which are distributiveand translations which are collective.
Plural "the', onthe other hand, is unambiguously collective, and hasthe translation:(X,X: (~.~./:'(U(,X))))where "U" takes a set of sets and delivers the setwhich is their union.The following is a list of sentences paired withtheir translations under this scheme:The boys walkWALK(BOYS)Each boy walksVx e BOYS': WALK(x)The boys gatherGATHER(BOYS)The squares contain the circlesCONTAIN(SQUARES,CIRCLES)For "the" + plural NP's we thus obtain analyses whichare, though not incorrect, perhaps more vague thanone would desire.
These analyses can be furtherspelled out by providing distributive predicates, suchas "WALK" and "CONTAIN', with meaning postulateswhich control how that predicate is distributed overthe constituents of its argument.
For example, themeaning postulate associated with "WALK" could be:WALK\[x\] - \[#(x) ?
t3\] ^  \[rye x': WALK\[y\]\]which, when applied to the above translation"WALK\[BOYS\]', gives the result:\[#(BOYS) > 0\] ^  \[Vy ~ BOYS*: WALK\[y\]\]which represents the desired distributive truth-conditions.The meaning postulate for "CONTAIN" could be:CONTAIN\[u,v\] - Vy ~ v': 3xe u': CONTAIN\[x,y\]This meaning postulate may be thought of as ex-pressing a basic fact about the notion of containment;namely that one composite object is "contained" byanother if every every part of the first is contained insome part of the second.
Application of this meaningpostulate to the translationCONTAIN\[SQUARES,CIRCLES\]gives the final result:Vy ~ SQUARES*: 3x E CIRCLES': CONTAIN\[x,y\]which expresses the truth-conditions we originally18desired; namely those paraphrasable by "Every circleis contained by some square'.In general, it is expected that different verbs willhave different meaning postulates, corresponding tothe different facts and beliefs about the world thatpertain to them.2.2 P rob lemsConjuncbve Noun Phrases"DCC" only treated plural Noun Phrases (such as"the boys" and "some girls'), but did not deal withconjunctive Noun Phrases ('John, Peter and Bill', "theboys and the girls", or "the committees and thejuries").
It is not immediately clear how a treatment ofthem would be added.
Note that a PTQ-style 3 treat-ment of the NP "John and Peter":~.P: P(John' ) ^  P(Peter' )would encounter serious difficulties with a sentencelike "John and Peter carried a piano upstairs'.
Here itwould predict only the distributed reading, yet a col-lective reading is the desired one.It would be more in the spirit of the treatment in"DCC" to combine the denotations of the NPs that areconjoined by some form of union.
For example, "Johnand Peter', "The boys and the girls" might be trans-lated as:;LP: P({John' ,Peter' ))~.P: P(BOYS U GIRLS)For a sentence like "The boys and the girls gather"this prevents what we call the "partially" distributive"reading - namely the reading in which the boys gatherin one place and the girls in another.For this reason, it seems incorrect to assimilate allNP denota~ons to the type of sets of individuals.Noun phrases like "The boys and the girls" or "Thejuries and the committees', are what we call "multi-level plurals': they have internal structure which can-not be abolished by assimilation to a single seLNote that the plural NP "the committees" is amulti-level plural as well, even though it is not a con-junction.
The sentence "The committees gather" hasa partially distributive reading (each committe gathersseparately) analogous with the partially distributivereading for "The boys and girls gather" above.Ambiguity and Discourse EffectsThe final problem for the treatment in "DCC" hasto do with the meaning postulates themselves.
Thesealways dictate the same distribution pattam for anyverb, yet it does not seem plausible that one couldfinally decide what this should be, since the beliefsand knowledge about the world from which they arederived are subject to variation from speaker tospeaker.Variability in distribution might also be imposed bycontext.
Consider the sentence "The children ate thepizzas" and a world depicted by the figure in 2.1where the squares represent children, and the circles,pizzas.
Now there will be different quantificationalreadings of the sentence.
The question "What did thechildren eat?"
might be reasonably answered by "Thepizzas'.
If one were to instead ask "Who ate thepizzas?"
(with a view, perhaps, to establishing in-dividual guilt) the answer "The children" would not beas felicitous, since the picture includes one square(child) not containing anything.It is to these problems with meaning postulatesthat we now turn in Section 3.
The solution presentedthere is then used in Section 4, where we present oursolution to the NP-conjunction/multi-level pluralproblem.3 THE AMBIGUITY PROBLEM3.1 The  Prob lem wi th  Mean ing  Postu la tesThat certain predicates may have different dis-tributive expansions in different contexts cannot becaptured by meaning postulates: since meaning pos-tulates are stipulated to be true in all models it islogically incoherent to have several, mutually incom-patible meaning postulates for the same constant.
4An alternative might be to retreat from the notionof meaning postulates per se, and view them insteadas some form of conventional implicatures which are"usually" or "often" true.
While it is impossible to havealternative meaning postulates, it is easier to imaginehaving alternative implicatures.For a semantics which aspires to state specifictruth-conditions this is not a very attractive position.We prefer to view these as alternative readings of thesentence, stemming from an open-ended ambiguity ofthe lexicai items in question - an ambiguity which hasto do with the specific details of distributions.Since this ambiguity is not one of syntactic type itdoes not make sense (in either explanatory or com-putational terms) to multiply lexical entries on its be-half.
Rather, one wants a level of representation inwhich these distributional issues are left open, to beresolved by a later stage of processing.3We use the worn "style" because Montague's original paper\[6\] only conjoined term phrases with "or'.
The extens~n to "and',however, is straJghtforward.4One might fi to combine them into a single meening postulate byIogr,,al disjunction.
We have indicated Oefo~re \[9\] why this approach isnot satisfactory.193.2 Two Levels of Semantic InterpretationTo accommodate this our system employs twostages of semantic interpretation, using a techniquefor coping with lexical ambiguity which was originallydeveloped for the Question-Answering SystemPHLIQA \[3\] [8\].
The first stage uses a context-freegrammar with associated semantic rules to producean expression of the logical language EFL (forEnglish-Oriented Formal Language).
EFL includes adescriptive constant for each word in the lexicon,however many senses that word may have.
HenceEFL is an ambiguous logical language; in technicalterms this means either that the language has amodel-theory that assigns multiple denotations to asingle expression \[5\], or that its expressions areviewed as schemata which abbreviate sets of possibleinstance-expressions.
\[g\]The second stage translates the EFL expressioninto one or more expressions of WML (for WorldModel Language).
WML, while differing syntacticallyfrom EFL only in its descriptive constants, is un-ambiguous, and includes a descriptive constant foreach primitive concept of the application domain inquestion.
A set of translation rules relates each am-biguous constant of EFL to a set of WML expressionsrepresenting its possible meanings.
Translation ofEFL expressions to WM/expressions is effected byproducing all possible combinations of constant sub-stitutions and removing those which are "semanticallyanomalous", in a sense which we will shortly define.EFL and WML are instantiations of a higher-orderlogic with a recursive type system.
In particular, if (xand I~ are types, then:sets(.)sets(sets(=))sets(sets(sets(.
)))fun(~ 13)fun(sets(c?),~)fun(sets(.),sets(13)).
.
.
oare all types.
The type "sets(,)" is the type of setswhose elements are of type eL The type =FUN((x,~)"is the type of functions from type o~ to type 13.Every expression has a type.
which is computedfrom the type of its sub-expressions.
Types havedomains which are sets; whatever denotation an ex-pression can take on must be an element of thedomain of its type.
Some expressions, being con-structed from combinations of sub-expressions of in-appropriate types, are not meaningful and are said tobe "semantically anomalous".
These are assigned aspecial type, called NULL-SET, whose domain is theempty set.For example, if =F" is an expression of typefun(o?,~) and "a" is an expression of type 7. whosedomain is disjoint from the domain o f .
,  then the ex-pression "F(a)" representing the application of "F" to"a" is anomalous and has the type NULL-SET.For more details on these formal languages andtheir associated type system, see the paper byLandsbergen and Scha \[5\].3.3 Translation Rules Instead of MeaningPostulatesWe are now in a position to replace the meaningpostulates of the "DCC" system with their equivalentEFt.
to WML translation rules.
For example, theoriginal treatment of "contain" would now berepresented by the translation rule:CONTAIN ->Zu, v: Vy E v': 3x E u': CONTAIN' Ix.Y\]Note that the constant "CONTAIN'" on the right-handside is a constant of WML.
and is notationallyseparated from its EFL counterpart by a prime-mark.The device of translation rules can now bebrought to bear on the problem mentioned in section22.
namely the distributional ambiguity (in context) ofthe transitive verb "eat*.
The reading which allows anexception in the first argument would be generated bythe translation rule:EAT -> ~.u, v: Vy ett :  :ix E u*: EAT' \[x,y\]while the reading which allows no such exceptionwould be:EAT ..>ZU.V: \[VX E V': : ly e u': EAT' \[y,x\]\] ^\[Vx E U': : lye I/': EAT' Ix,Y\]\]We call this a "leave none out* tran~ation.
Whenapplied to the sentence "The children ate the pizzas"this generates the reading where all children areguilty.By using this device of translation rules a verbmay be provided with any desired (finite) number ofalternative distribution patterns.The next section, which presents this paper'streatment of the multiple plurals problem, will makeuse of a slight modification of the foregoing in whichthe translation rules are allowed to contain EFL con-stants on their right-hand sides as well as their left,thus making the process recursive.4 MULTIPLE LEVELS OF PLURALITY4.1 OverviewAs we have seen in Section 2.2. utterances whichcontain multi-level plurals sometimes give rise tomixed collective/distributive r adings which cannot beaccounted for without retaining the separate semanticidentity of the constituents.20Consider, for instance, the sentence "The juriesand the committees gather".
This has three readings:one in which each of the juries gathers alone andeach of the committees gathers alone as well(distribution over two levels), another in which all per-sons who are committee members gather in oneplace and all persons who are jurors gather in anotherplace (distribution" over one level), and finally a third inwhich all jurors and committee members unite in onelarge convention (completely collective).
It seems in-escapable, therefore, that the internal multi-levelstructure of NPs has to be preserved.Indeed.
it can be argued that the number of levelsnecessary is not two or three but arbitrary.
AsLandman \[4\] has pointed out.
conjunctions can be ar-bitrarily nested (consider all the groupings that arepossible in the NP "Bob and Carol and Ted andAlice"!).
Therefore.
the sets which represent collec-tive entities must, in principle, be allowed to be ofarbitrary complexity.
This is the view we adopt.Allowing arbitrary complexity in the structure ofcollective en~ties creates a problem for specifying thedistributive interpretations of collective predicates:they can no longer be enumerated by finite lists oftranslation rules.
An arbitrary number of levels ofstructure means an arbitrary number of ways to dis-tribute, and these cannot be finitely enumerated.In order to handle these issues it is necessary toextend the ambiguity treatment of the previous sub-section so that.
as is advocated in \[9\], it recutsivelyenumerates this infinite set of alternatives.
In order todo this we must allow EFL constants to also appearon the right-hand side of translation rules as well ason the left.In the next sub-section we present such a recur-sive EFL constant.
Its role in the system is to dealwith distributions over arbitrarily complex plural struc-tures.4.2 The  PARTS Funct ionFor any complex structure there is generally morethan one way to decompose it into parts.
For ex-ample, the structure{ {John,Peter,Bill},{Mary,Jane,Lucy) }can be viewed as either having two parts - the sets'{John,Peter.Bill)' and '{Mary,Jane,Lucy}' - or six - thesix people John,Peter,Bill,Mary,Jane, and Lucy.These multiple perspectives on a complex entityare accommodated in our system by the EFL functionPARTS.
This function takes a term, simple or com-plex, and returns the set of "parts" (that is, mathemati-cal "parts") making it up.
Because there is in generalmore than one way to decompose a composite entitityinto parts, this is an ambiguous term which can beexpanded in more than one way.
In addition, becausethe set-theoretic structures corresponding to plural en-titles can be arbitrarily complex, some expansionsmust be recursive, containing PARTS itself on theright-hand side.The expansions of PARTS are:1.
PARTS\[x\] -> x (where x an individual)2.
PARTS\[s\] => (for: s, collect: PARTS)(where s a set)3.
PARTS\[s\] -> U(for: s. collect: PARTS)(where s a set)4.
PARTS\[x\] ,,> F\[x\]Rule (1) asserts that any atomic entity is indivisible,that is, is its own sole part (remember, we are talkingabout mathematical, not physical parts here).
Rules(2) and (3) range over sets and collect together theset of values of PARTS for each member; rule (3)differs in that it merges these into a single set with theoperator 'U'.
'U' takes a set of sets and returns theirunion.
In rule (4) "F" is a descriptive function.
Thisrule is included to handle notions like membership ofa committee, etc.Suppose PARTS is applied to the structure:{ {John,Peter,Bill),{Mary~Jane,Lucy} )corresponding, perhaps, to the denotation of the NP"The boys and the gids'.
The alternative sets of partsof this structure are:(1) {John,Petar,BilI,Mary,Jane,LucY }(2) { {John,Peter,Bill},{Mary,Jane,Lucy} }Let us see how these ~-re produced by recursivelyexpanding the funclion PARTS.
Suppose we invokerule (3) to begin with.
This produces:U(for: { {John,Peter,Bill},{Mary,Jane,Lucy} },collect: PARTS)Now suppose we invoke rule (2) on this, resulting in:U(for: { {John,Peter,Bill),{Mary,Jane,Lucy} },collect: ~.x: (for: x, collect: PARTS))In the final step, we invoke rule (1) to produce:U(for:{ {John,Peter.Bill},{Mary,Jane,Lucy) }collect: Zx:.
(for: x,collect: ~.x: x)This expression simplifies to:{John,Peter,BUI.Mary,Jane,Lucy)which is just the expansion (1) above.Now suppose we had invoked rule (2) to startwith, instead of rule (3).
This would produce the ex-pansion:for: { {John.Petar,Bill},{Mary,Jane,Lucy) ),collect: PARTSThe rest of the derivation is the same as in the first21example.
We invoke rule (2) to produce the expan-sionfor: { {John,Peter, Bill},{Mary,Jane,Lucy} },collect: ~.x:.
(for: x, collect: PARTS)Rule (1) is then invoked:for: { {John,Peter.Bill},{Mary,Jane,Lucy} },collect: ~.x:.
(for: x,collect: ~.x:.
x)There are now no more occurrences of PARTS left.This expression reduces by logical equivalence to:{ {John, Peter,Bill},{Mary,Jane,Lucy} }which is just the expansion (2).We now proceed to the distributing translationrules for verbs, which make use of the PARTS func-tion in order to account for the multiple distributionalreadings economically.4.3 The Distr ibut ing Trans lat ion RulesThe form below is an example of the new schemefor the translation rules, a translation which can copewith the problem originally posed in section 2.1, "Thesquares contain the circles'.
"sCONTAIN ->~.u,v : Vx ?
PARTS\[{v}\]:3y ?
PARTS\[{u}\]: CONTAIN' \[y,x\]This revised system can now cope with multi-levelplural arguments to the verb "contain".
Suppose weare given "The squares contain the circles andtriangled'.
The initial translation is then:Vx ?
PARTS\[{{CIRCLES,TRIANGLES}}\]:3y ?
PARTS\[{SQUARES}\]:CONTAIN' \[y,x\]The ranges of the quantifiers each contain an occur-rence of the PARTS function, so it is ambiguous as towhat they quantify over.
Note, however, that theWML predicate CONTAIN' is typed as being ap-plicable to individuals only.
Inappropriate xpansionsfor the quantifier anges therefore result in anomalousexpressions which the translation algorithm filters out.The first range restriction:PARTS\[{{CIRCLES,TRIANGLES}}\]is expanded to:U(for: {{CIRCLES.TRIANGLES}},collect: ~.x: U(for: x,collect: Zx (for: x, collect: ~.x.
x)))by a sequence of expansion rule applications(3),(3),(2),(2), and (1).
This final form is equivalent o:SNote one othe?
modification with rescNmt to the t re~lentpresented in section 2.1: predicates transiting verbs are now al-Iowe~ to operate on individuals instea?l of sets onlyU(CIRCLES,TRIANGLES)The other restriction, 'PARTS\[{SQUARES}\]', isreduced by similar means to just 'SQUARES'.
Wehave, finally:Vx E U(CIRCLES,TRIANGLES):3y ?
SQUARES: CONTAIN' \[y,x\]which expresses the desired truth-conditions.4.4 Part ial  D is t r ibut ion  of Col lect ive VerbsLet us take up again the example "The juries andcommittees gather*, Recall that this has three read-ings: one in which each deliberative body gathersapart, another in which the various jurors combine in agathering and the various committee members com-bine separately in another gather, and finally, one inwhich all persons concerned, be they jurors or com-mittee members, come together to form a singlegathering.These readings are accounted for by the followingtranslation rule for GATHER:GATHER => ;Lx:.
Vy ?
PARTS\[{x}\]: GATHER' \[y\]Applying this rule to the initial translation:GATHER\[{{JURIES,COMMITrEES}}\]produces the expression:Vy ?
PARTS\[{{JURIES,COMMITTEES}}\]:GATHER' \[y\]The various readings of this now depend upon whatthe range of quantification is expanded to.
This mustbe a set of sets of persons in order to fit the type ofGATHER', which is a predicate on sets of persons.We will now show how the PARTS functionderives the decompositions that allow each of thesereadings.
Because of the collective nature of theterms "jury" and "committee" ,we will use rule (4),which uses an arbitrary descriptive function to decom-pose an element.Suppose that 'JURIES' has the extension '{Jl ,J2,J3}'and 'COMMITTEES' has the extension '{Cl,C2,C3}'.Suppose also that the the descriptive function'MEMBERS-OF' is available, taking an organizationsuch as a jury or committee onto the set of peoplewho are its members.
Let it have an extension cor-responding to:Jl "-~ {a,b,c}J2 -'>' {d.e.f)J3 ~ {g,h,i}c 1 ~ {j,k,I}c 2 --+ {m,n,o}c 3 --+ {p,q,r}where the letters a,b,c, etc.
represent persons.The derivation (3),(3),(2),(4) yields the first of thereadings above, in which the verb is partially dis-22.tributed over two levels.
The range of quantificationhas the extension:{ {a,b,c},{d,e,f},{g,h,i},{j,k,I},{m,n,o},{p,q,r}This is the reading in which each jury and committeegathers by itself.The derivation (3),(2),(3),(4) yields the secondreading, in which the verb is partially distributed overthe outer level.
The derivation produces a range ofquantification whose extension is:{ {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i},{j,k,l,m,n,o.p,q,r} }This is the reading in which the jurors gather in oneplace and the committee members in another.Finally, the derivation (2),(3),(3),(4) yields the thirdreading, which is completely collective.
This deriva-tion produces a range of quantification whose exten-sion is:{ {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r} }This is the reading in which all persons who are eitherjurors or committee members gather.5 OTHER PARTS OF SPEECHIn this section we discuss distributional considera-tions for argument-taking parts of speech other thanverbs - specifically prepositions and adjectives.Prepositions in our system are translated as two-placepredicates, adjectives as one-place predicates.
Thedistributional issues they raise are therefore treatableby the same machinery we have developed for tran-sitive and intransitive verbs.5.1 P repos i t ionsPrepositions are subject to distributional con-siderations that are analogous to those of transitiveverbs.
Consider:The books are on the shelvesGiven facts about physical objects and spatial loca-tion, the most plausible meaning for this sentence isthat every book is on some shelf or other.
This wouldbe expressed by the translation rule:Zu, v : Vx?
PARTS(u): :ly~ PARTS(v): ON' (x,y)Note the similarity with the translation rule for"CONTAIN".
from which it differs in that the roles ofthe first and the second argument in the quantifica-tional structure are reversed.5.2 Adject ivesThe treatment of adjectives in regular form is ex-actly analogous with that given intransitive verbs suchas "walk".
Thus, for the adjective "red", we may havethe translation rule:RED => Zu : Vxe PARTS(u): RED(x)A more interesting problem is seen in sentences con-taining the comparative form of an adjective, as in:The frigates are faster than the cardersWhat are the truth-conditions of this sentence?
Onemight construe it to mean that every frigate is fasterthan every carrier, but this seems unneccesarilystrong.
Intuitively, it seems to mean something a littleweaker than that, allowing perhaps for a few excep-tions in which a particular carrier is not faster than aparticular frigate.On the other hand, another requirementeliminates truth-conditions which are too weak.
For if"The gates are faster than the carders" is true, itmust surely be the case that "The carriers are fasterthan the frigates" is false.
This requirement holds notonly for "faster", but for the comparative form of anyadjective.The treatment of comparative forms in the SpokenLanguage System can be illustrated by the followingschema:(~.x,y: larger(<uf>(x),<uf>(y)))in which '<uf>' is filled in by an "underlying function"particular to the adjective in question.
For the adjec-tive "fast", this underlying function is "speed".The requirement of anti-symmetry for the distribu-tions of comparatives is now reduced to a requirementof anti-symmetry for the distributional translation ofthe EFL constant "larger'.
In this way, the anti-symmet~/ requirement is expressed for all compara-tives at once.Obviously anti-symmetry is fufilled for theuniversal-universal translation, but, as we havepointed out, this is a very strong condition.
There isanother, weaker condition which fufills anti-symmeW:larger, ->~.u,v:.
Vx ~ PARTS\[u\]~y ?
PARTS\[v\]: larger' \[x,y\] ^Vx ?
PARTS\[v\]: 3y ?
PARTS\[u\]: larger, \[y,x\]When applied to the sentence above, this conditionsimply states that for every frigate there exists a car-tier that is slower than it.
and conversely, for everycarrier there exists a frigate that is faster than it.This is anti-symmetric as required.
For if there issome frigate that is faster than every carrier, therecannot be some carrier that is faster than everyfrigate.6 THE ALGORITHMThe algorithm which applies this method is an ex-tension of the previously-mentioned procedure ofgenerating all possible WML expansions from an EFLexpression and weeding out semantically anomalousones.
The two steps of generate and test are nowembedded in a loop that simply iterates until all EFL-level constants, including 'PARTS', are expanded23away.
This gives us a breadth-first search of thepossible recursive expansions of 'PARTS', one whichnevertheless does not fail to halt because seman-tically anomalous versions, such as those attemptingto quantify over expressions which are not sets, orthose applying descnptive relations to arguments ofthe wrong type, are weeded out and are not pursuedany further in the next iteration.We can now define the function TO-WML, whichtakes an EFL expression and produces a set of WMLexpressions without EFL constants.
It is:TO-WML(exp) "clefexpansions <- (exp}until ~(3e e expansions: EFL?
(e))dobecjinexpansions <- U(for: expansions,collect: ~.e for: AMBIG-TRANS(e)collect: SIMPLIFY)expansions <- {e e expansions: TYPEOF(e)=NULL-SET)endThe function AMBIG-TRANS expands the EFL-levelconstants in its input, and returns a set of expres-sions.
The function EFL?
returns true if any EFLconstants are present in its argument.
The functionTYPEOF takes an expression and returns its type; itreturns the symbol NULL-SET if the expression issemantically anomalous.
Note that if a particular ex-pansion is found to be semantically anomalous it isremoved from consideration.
If no non-anomalousexpansion can be found the procedure halts and theempty set of expansions {\] is returned.
In this casethe entire EFL expression is viewed as anomalousand the interpretation which gave rise to it can berejected.7 CONCLUSIONSWe have shown how treatments of thecollectJve/dis~butive distinction must take into ac-count the phenomenon of "partial distributivity', inwhich a collective verb optionally distributes over theouter levels of structure in what we call a "multi-level"plural.
Multiple levels of structure must be allowed inthe semantics of such plural NPs as "the boys and thegirls", "the committees", etc.We have presented a computational mechanismwhich accounts for these phenomena through aframework of recursive translation rules.
This.
'ramework generates quantifications over alternativelevels of plural structure in an NP, and can handleNPs of arbitrarily complex plural structure, It iseconomical in its means of producing arbitrary num-bers of readings: the multiple readings of the sen-tence such as "The juries and the committeesgathered" are expressed with just one translation rule.References\[1\] Bartsch, R.The Semantics and Syntax of Number andNumbers.In Kimball, J.P.
