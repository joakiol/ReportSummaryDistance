As a first stepto construct ~ large scale semantic dictionary (lexical knowledgebase) the authors of this paper have inspected a machine read-able ordinary English dictionary LDOCE, Longrnan l)ictionaryof Contempo,:ary English, 1.978 edition \[Procter 1987\].Extr~m{ing semantic information ti'om an ordinary dictionaryis ~n interesting research topic.
One of the o~ims of automatic ex--traction is to produce a thesaurus.
No'~l, for example, proposedthe idea of thesaurus production fl'om LDOCE in \[No~l 1982\].Amsler also showed the result of automatic thesaurus productionfrom a techniaeal encyclopedia \[Amsler 1987\].
Boguraev and AI--shawi have st ~ldied the.
utilization of LDOCE for natural languageproce~,:sfing re'.
;earches in geuerM \[Alshwai 1987,Bognraev 1987\].in this paper, the automatic extraction of scntantic reh~tion-ships between words l?om I,DOCE is described.
For the ex--traction, the m~gnctic tape version of 1,1)OCE is loaded intorelational d~.tabase system.
Developc~ extraction programs ana-lyze the definition sentence in LDOCE with a pattern matddngba~d algorithm.
Since this algorithm is not perfect, the resultof the extrac;;ion ha'~ been compared with semantic information(sem~mtic markers) which the magnetic t~pe version of bDOCF,co~rtains.
The result of comparison is also discussed ibr evaluat-ing the reliaLility of such ~n automatic extraction.,~ ~,DB Vers ion  of  LDOCEhi genera.l, a dictionary consists of a complex dat~ structure:various relationships between words; grammatical information;usage l~otes, etc.
'\['here.fore, we need a special database ma.nage-mer*t sy.~tem to handle dictionary data.
l, br inst~nme, \[Nag~m 1980\]shows mlch a system for retrieving a Japanese dictionary.
In thispa.per, however, the anthors are mainly interested in tile defini-tion and tile sample sentence parts of I,I)()(?E, ira;read of com-plex relati, ms among inlbrmation in the dictionary.For the sake of efticiency (including the cost of sy:;i.cm dcvetopment) of \[,DOCE retrieval, we have decided to u,';e a cowventional relational databa.~;e management system (I{I)BM).
'iFheIi.DBM which we use is running on the rnaiafr~mm eomputel ofKyoto University Data Proce~ing Center (Fujitsu M782, (),q/IVl"4 MSP, FACOM AIM/RDB).For loading the magnetic version of LDOCE into this t\[I)li/i\[VI,we have extracted the following fields from I,I)OCI,;:1.
IIead Word (IIW); 2.
Part-.of-Speech (PS); 3.
Deft-nition Number (DN); 4.
Grammar (?ode (GC); 5.
BoxCode (BC); 6.

"1'o automaticallyproduce the thesaurus from LDOCE, two programs have beendcveloped:1.
Key Verb extraction progra m.'2.
Key Noun and Function Noun extraction program.These programs and the result of extraction are discussed in thissection.3 .
i  Key  Verb  Ext rac t ion  P rogramMost of the definitions of verbs in LDOCE are described as:to VERB ...Usually VERB in tlfis pattern expresses a 'key concept' of thedefined verb.
Therefore, we c,.U this VERB a Key Verb.For example, the verbs semantically related to the verb t0 hithave the tollowing definitions:e strike: to hitTable 2: DefinitionHW | PS DN/ abandon v 1 abandon v 1 abandon v 2abandon v 3abandon v 4!abandon n 0abandon n 0abandoned adj 0Table {LDB.D2) of LDOCE/RDBDFto leave completely and fQr everdesertto leave (a relation o~ I~iend) in a though~less or cruel wayto give up, esp.

Ilowever, several 'loops' are found.
A 'loop'exprea~es a cyclic definition: ~o welcome is defined by t0 greet,and to greet is defined by lo welcome.
In the network, six typicalcyclic definitions are:do :  do (the verb to do does not have a key verb.
)cha~tge: dtange, move~ come, become~ go: go, leaveget: get, receivestop:: stop, ceaseo let: let, allow, permitNote that there are many other cyclic definitions in the network.However, most of them have a link to another verb; at least oneof the verb in a cyclic definitions is defined by another verb.Since no reader of LDOCE cml understand the meaning ofthese verbs only from the dictionary, these may be a kind of bugof the dictionary.
However, these cyclically defined verbs seem tocorrespond to semanlic primitives, which are first introduced toAI works by \[Sehank 1975\].
Semantic primitives may be definedoutside of linfuislic words.
Details of the result of extraction arediscussed in \[Nakamura 1986\].3o2 Key  Noun and  Funct ion  Noun Ext rac t ionP rogramWe cau apply a similar algorithm to definitions of nouns, al-though the pattern of definitions of nouns is mo~e complex thanthat of verbs, ln~ct ing  definitions with LDOCE/ttDB, mostof them a~e, classified into two forms:1.
{determiner} {adjective}* \]Key Noun {adjective phrase}*2.
{determiner} {adjective}* le-hnction Noun of Key Noun{adjective phrase}*The first one is a simple form and many of them express is-arelations between a defined:noun and a key noun.
For example,abandon: the w~aSe when one's feelings sad actionsaxe u;acontroIledshows thatabandon is-a slate.The second form expresses more complex ~mantic relationsbetween ouns.abbey: the group of people living in such a buildingshows thatabbey is-a-group-of people.A function noun, therefore, explicitly expresses the semantic re-lation between a head word and a key noun.With terras of a semantic network, defined nouns aml keynouns are nodes in a semantic network, and function nouns(when function noun is empty, its function noun is regared ~kind) expre~ the name of a link between odes.
The followingnouns (41 nouns, in total) are considered to be function nouns,which are mannally extracted.is-a: kind, type, ...o part-of:  part, side, top, ...member~shlp:  set, member, group, class, family, ...?
action: act, way, action, ...state: state, condition, ...amount :  amount, sum, measure, ...degree:  degree, quality, ...?
form: form, shape, ...A program to extract key nouns and function nouns from thedefinitions of nouns is developed, rl~ble 5 shows a part of the keynoun and fmtction noun table in the LI)OCE/RI)B (LDBN.D2)generated by this program.As shown in table 6, the key noun of highest frequency isperson (2174 times) and for function noun is type (1064 times)except null function noun (pattern 1).
'lYaversing is-a relation, for example, a thesaurus has beenobtained \[Nakamura 1987\].
Table 7 shows a part of the autmnat-ically obtained thesaurus, whose 'root' word is person: actor isa-kind-of person; comedian, ezlra, ham, and mime are a-kind-ofactor; comedienne is a-kind-of comedian.4 Comparison between Result  of Ex-tract ion and BOX CodeThe thesmlrus produced from LDOCE by the key noun and keyverb extraction programs is all approximate one, and, obviously,contains everal errors.
The key noun of abbreviation 1, for ex-ample, is shorler in table 5, because the current program ignoresing-formed words.
However, it should be making.
(Even if we(:hanged the extraction algorithm, still we have a problem thatmaking is not a simple noun, but a gerund.
We need to definenoun-verb semantic relations.)
To evaluate the quality of theproduced thesaurus, the noun part of the thesaurus has beencompared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.461.Table(LDBN.D2, part)l lW )Nabandon 0al)~udon 0abbey 1M)bey 1~,bbey 2M)bey 3abbreviation tal)brcviatiou 25: Definition, Key Noun*J?.

~Nouns rdated to the concept animate have a relatively rumplest,nctnre in the thesaurus, us auimat~ is often used ~s an example(:d ~?

In the definitionof cro~b','eed (table 9), the produced thesaurus only uses planta~ v. key nom~, and ingores a~lffmal.

The~e function nouns classify abstract nouns.For example, there are 597 nouns whose function noun is ilct,and 584 nouns (97%) of them are marked as 'abstract'; there are398 nouns whose function noun is state, and 391 nouns (98%)of them are 'abstract.'
The distinction between <state' and 'act',h)r instance, is useful for natural anguage processing in general.4.4 Nouns  Marked  as ' Inan imate 'Some 'Inanimate' nouns are correctly identified in the producedthesaurus (table 11).
Especially, 39% of nouns under the nounliquid have 'Liquid' markers, and 56~ of nmms under the noungas have 'Gas' markers.However, many <Inanimate' nouns are defined by substancein LDOCE.
Sub-classification f these noun is expr(~sed with acompound word (or an adjective) as shown in table 11: coke is asolid substance; f luorine is a non-metallic substance.
Since thecurrect extraction program does not handle a compound word,the thesaurus cannot express these classification.4.5 Other  Typ ica l  NounsSeveral typical nouns in the produced thesaurus are also com-pared with markers of LDOCE.
Because the current system can.-not distinguish senses of nouns, nouns which have several differ-ent senses causes a problem.
A typical example is found in thedefinitions whose key noun is case.
As shown in table 12, altacheease and tesl ease are both defined by case; these expr~ses cornpletely different concept.
In 30 nouns whose key noun is case,Table 11: Examples ofRWhydrogenwatercokefluorineB1 KNL liquidS substanceG'  substanceNouns Marked as 'Inanimate'DFa gas that is a simple substance(ELEMENT), without colour orsmell, that is lighter than Mr andthat burns very emsiiythe most common liquid,' withoutcolour, taste, or smell, wtlk:h fallsfrom the sky as rain, forms rivers,lakes, and seas, and is drunk by peo-ple and animalsthe solid substance that remains af-ter gas has been removed from coalby heatinga non-metallic substance, na~l, inthe form of a poisonous palegreenish-yellow gas463Table 12: Nouns whose key noun is caseHW B1 I KN DFattache case J case ryinga thinpapershard c se with a handle, for car-test case T case a case in acourt of law which establishesa particular principle and is then as astandard against which other eases canbe judgedHWCaUVaSdenimsergetweedJSJSTable 13: Nouns related the noun clothL FF DFstrong rough cloth used for tent, sails, bags,etc.a strong cotton cloth used esp.

'Difficulity of semantic marking is also found.
For example,lexicographers could not mark 'movable (J)' and 'Solid' system-atically.
For example, some nouns whose key noun is cloth aremarked as 'Solid', and others are marked as 'movable (J)' (ta-ble 13).
This is a problem in gathering of semantic informationitself.5 ConclusionThe extraction of semantic relations between verbs and nounsfrom LDOCE is discussed.
Data from the magnetic version ofLDOCE is first loaded into a relational database system for sim-plicity of retrieving.
For the extraction of semantic relations,programs to find key verb, key noun, and function noun havebeen developed.
Using these programs, the thesaurus i  auto-matically produced.?
b evaluate the quality of the noun part of the produced the-saurus, it is compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.
Al-though the produced thesaurus has several problems such as thedifficulty of expressing disjunctive concepts, the comparison be-tween the produced thesaurus and semantic markers in LDOCEshows the possibility of sub-classifiCation of 'abstract' nouns.AcknowledgementsThe authors grateful to Prof. Jun-ichi Tsujii for his fruitful com-ments on.
