We measured timing and intra- andinter-annotator agreement for three types ofsubjective evaluation.
We measured the cor-relation of automatic evaluation metrics withhuman judgments.
This meta-evaluation re-veals surprising facts about the most com-monly used methodologies.1 IntroductionThis paper presents the results for the shared trans-lation task of the 2007 ACL Workshop on StatisticalMachine Translation.
The goals of this paper aretwofold: First, we evaluate the shared task entriesin order to determine which systems produce trans-lations with the highest quality.
Second, we analyzethe evaluation measures themselves in order to try todetermine ?best practices?
when evaluating machinetranslation research.Previous ACL Workshops on Machine Transla-tion were more limited in scope (Koehn and Monz,2005; Koehn and Monz, 2006).
The 2005 workshopevaluated translation quality only in terms of Bleuscore.
The 2006 workshop additionally included alimited manual evaluation in the style of NIST ma-chine translation evaluation workshop.
Here we ap-ply eleven different automatic evaluation metrics,and conduct three different types of manual evalu-ation.Beyond examining the quality of translations pro-duced by various systems, we were interested in ex-amining the following questions about evaluationmethodologies: How consistent are people whenthey judge translation quality?
To what extent dothey agree with other annotators?
Can we im-prove human evaluation?
Which automatic evalu-ation metrics correlate most strongly with humanjudgments of translation quality?This paper is organized as follows:?
Section 2 gives an overview of the shared task.It describes the training and test data, reviewsthe baseline system, and lists the groups thatparticipated in the task.?
Section 3 describes the manual evaluation.
Weperformed three types of evaluation: scoringwith five point scales, relative ranking of trans-lations of sentences, and ranking of translationsof phrases.?
Section 4 lists the eleven different automaticevaluation metrics which were also used toscore the shared task submissions.?
Section 5 presents the results of the shared task,giving scores for each of the systems in each ofthe different conditions.?
Section 6 provides an evaluation of the dif-ferent types of evaluation, giving intra- and136inter-annotator agreement figures for the man-ual evaluation, and correlation numbers for theautomatic metrics.2 Shared task overviewThis year?s shared task changed in some aspectsfrom last year?s:?
We gave preference to the manual evaluation ofsystem output in the ranking of systems.
Man-ual evaluation was done by the volunteers fromparticipating groups and others.
Additionally,there were three modalities of manual evalua-tion.?
Automatic metrics were also used to rank thesystems.
In total eleven metrics were applied,and their correlation with the manual scoreswas measured.?
As in 2006, translation was from English, andinto English.
English was again paired withGerman, French, and Spanish.
We additionallyincluded Czech (which was fitting given the lo-cation of the WS).Similar to the IWSLT International Workshop onSpoken Language Translation (Eck and Hori, 2005;Paul, 2006), and the NIST Machine TranslationEvaluation Workshop (Lee, 2006) we provide theshared task participants with a common set of train-ing and test data for all language pairs.
The majorpart of data comes from current and upcoming fullreleases of the Europarl data set (Koehn, 2005).2.1 Description of the DataThe data used in this year?s shared task was similarto the data used in last year?s shared task.
This year?sdata included training and development sets for theNews Commentary data, which was the surprise out-of-domain test set last year.The majority of the training data for the Spanish,French, and German tasks was drawn from a newversion of the Europarl multilingual corpus.
Addi-tional training data was taken from the News Com-mentary corpus.
Czech language resources weredrawn from the News Commentary data.
Additionalresources for Czech came from the CzEng Paral-lel Corpus (Bojar and Z?abokrtsky?, 2006).
Overall,there are over 30 million words of training data perlanguage from the Europarl corpus and 1 millionwords from the News Commentary corpus.
Figure 1provides some statistics about the corpora used thisyear.2.2 Baseline systemTo lower the barrier of entrance to the competition,we provided a complete baseline MT system, alongwith data resources.
To summarize, we provided:?
sentence-aligned training corpora?
development and dev-test sets?
language models trained for each language?
an open source decoder for phrase-based SMTcalled Moses (Koehn et al, 2006), which re-places the Pharaoh decoder (Koehn, 2004)?
a training script to build models for MosesThe performance of this baseline system is similarto the best submissions in last year?s shared task.2.3 Test DataThe test data was again drawn from a segment ofthe Europarl corpus from the fourth quarter of 2000,which is excluded from the training data.
Partici-pants were also provided with three sets of paralleltext to be used for system development and tuning.In addition to the Europarl test set, we also col-lected editorials from the Project Syndicate web-site1, which are published in all the five languagesof the shared task.
We aligned the texts at a sentencelevel across all five languages, resulting in 2,007sentences per language.
For statistics on this test set,refer to Figure 1.The News Commentary test set differs from theEuroparl data in various ways.
The text type are ed-itorials instead of speech transcripts.
The domain isgeneral politics, economics and science.
However, itis also mostly political content (even if not focusedon the internal workings of the European Union) andopinion.2.4 ParticipantsWe received submissions from 15 groups from 14institutions, as listed in Table 1.

Not all groups participated in all translation directions.increase over last year?s shared task where submis-sions were received from 14 groups from 11 insti-tutions.
Of the 11 groups that participated in lastyear?s shared task, 6 groups returned this year.This year, most of these groups follow a phrase-based statistical approach to machine translation.However, several groups submitted results from sys-tems that followed a hybrid approach.While building a machine translation system is aserious undertaking we hope to attract more new-comers to the field by keeping the barrier of entryas low as possible.
The creation of parallel corporasuch as the Europarl, the CzEng, and the News Com-mentary corpora should help in this direction by pro-viding freely available language resources for build-ing systems.
The creation of an open source baselinesystem should also go a long way towards achievingthis goal.For more on the participating systems, please re-fer to the respective system description in the pro-ceedings of the workshop.3 Human evaluationWe evaluated the shared task submissions using bothmanual evaluation and automatic metrics.
Whileautomatic measures are an invaluable tool for theday-to-day development of machine translation sys-tems, they are an imperfect substitute for humanassessment of translation quality.
Manual evalua-tion is time consuming and expensive to perform,so comprehensive comparisons of multiple systemsare rare.
For our manual evaluation we distributedthe workload across a number of people, includingparticipants in the shared task, interested volunteers,and a small number of paid annotators.
More than100 people participated in the manual evaluation,with 75 of those people putting in at least an hour?sworth of effort.
A total of 330 hours of labor was in-vested, nearly doubling last year?s all-volunteer ef-fort which yielded 180 hours of effort.Beyond simply ranking the shared task submis-sions, we had a number of scientific goals for themanual evaluation.
Firstly, we wanted to collectdata which could be used to assess how well au-tomatic metrics correlate with human judgments.Secondly, we wanted to examine different types ofmanual evaluation and assess which was the best.A number of criteria could be adopted for choos-ing among different types of manual evaluation: theease with which people are able to perform the task,their agreement with other annotators, their reliabil-ity when asked to repeat judgments, or the numberof judgments which can be collected in a fixed timeperiod.There are a range of possibilities for how human139evaluation of machine translation can be done.
Forinstance, it can be evaluated with reading compre-hension tests (Jones et al, 2005), or by assigningsubjective scores to the translations of individualsentences (LDC, 2005).
We examined three differ-ent ways of manually evaluating machine translationquality:?
Assigning scores based on five point adequacyand fluency scales?
Ranking translated sentences relative to eachother?
Ranking the translations of syntactic con-stituents drawn from the source sentence3.1 Fluency and adequacyThe most widely used methodology when manuallyevaluatingMT is to assign values from two five pointscales representing fluency and adequacy.
Thesescales were developed for the annual NIST MachineTranslation Evaluation Workshop by the LinguisticsData Consortium (LDC, 2005).The five point scale for adequacy indicates howmuch of the meaning expressed in the referencetranslation is also expressed in a hypothesis trans-lation:5 = All4 = Most3 = Much2 = Little1 = NoneThe second five point scale indicates how fluentthe translation is.
When translating into English thevalues correspond to:5 = Flawless English4 = Good English3 = Non-native English2 = Disfluent English1 = IncomprehensibleSeparate scales for fluency and adequacy weredeveloped under the assumption that a translationmight be disfluent but contain all the informationfrom the source.
However, in principle it seems thatpeople have a hard time separating these two as-pects of translation.
The high correlation betweenpeople?s fluency and adequacy scores (given in Ta-bles 17 and 18) indicate that the distinction might befalse.

translationsAnother problem with the scores is that there areno clear guidelines on how to assign values to trans-lations.
No instructions are given to evaluators interms of how to quantify meaning, or how manygrammatical errors (or what sort) separates the dif-ferent levels of fluency.
Because of this many judgeseither develop their own rules of thumb, or use thescales as relative rather than absolute.
These areborne out in our analysis of inter-annotator agree-ment in Section 6.3.2 Ranking translations of sentencesBecause fluency and adequacy were seemingly diffi-cult things for judges to agree on, and because manypeople from last year?s workshop seemed to be usingthem as a way of ranking translations, we decided totry a separate evaluation where people were simply140asked to rank translations.
The instructions for thistask were:Rank each whole sentence translationfrom Best to Worst relative to the otherchoices (ties are allowed).These instructions were just as minimal as for flu-ency and adequacy, but the task was considerablysimplified.
Rather than having to assign each trans-lation a value along an arbitrary scale, people simplyhad to compare different translations of a single sen-tence and rank them.3.3 Ranking translations of syntacticconstituentsIn addition to having judges rank the translationsof whole sentences, we also conducted a pilotstudy of a new type of evaluation methodology,which we call constituent-based evaluation.
In ourconstituent-based evaluation we parsed the sourcelanguage sentence, selected constituents from thetree, and had people judge the translations of thosesyntactic phrases.
In order to draw judges?
attentionto these regions, we highlighted the selected sourcephrases and the corresponding phrases in the transla-tions.
The corresponding phrases in the translationswere located via automatic word alignments.Figure 2 illustrates the constituent based evalu-ation when applied to a German source sentence.The German source sentence is parsed, and vari-ous phrases are selected for evaluation.
Word align-ments are created between the source sentence andthe reference translation (shown), and the sourcesentence and each of the system translations (notshown).
We parsed the test sentences for each ofthe languages aside from Czech.
We used Cowanand Collins (2005)?s parser for Spanish, Arun andKeller (2005)?s for French, Dubey (2005)?s for Ger-man, and Bikel (2002)?s for English.The word alignments were created with Giza++(Och and Ney, 2003) applied to a parallel corpuscontaining 200,000 sentence pairs of the trainingdata, plus sets of 4,007 sentence pairs created bypairing the test sentences with the reference transla-tions, and the test sentences paired with each of thesystem translations.
The phrases in the translationswere located using techniques from phrase-basedstatistical machine translation which extract phrasepairs fromword alignments (Koehn et al, 2003; Ochand Ney, 2004).
Because the word-alignments werecreated automatically, and because the phrase ex-traction is heuristic, the phrases that were selectedmay not exactly correspond to the translations of theselected source phrase.
We noted this in the instruc-tions to judges:Rank each constituent translation fromBest to Worst relative to the other choices(ties are allowed).
Grade only the high-lighted part of each translation.Please note that segments are selected au-tomatically, and they should be taken asan approximate guide.
They might in-clude extra words that are not in the actualalignment, or miss words on either end.The criteria that we used to select which con-stituents were to be evaluated were:?
The constituent could not be the whole sourcesentence?
The constituent had to be longer three words,and be no longer than 15 words?
The constituent had to have a correspondingphrase with a consistent word alignment ineach of the translationsThe final criterion helped reduce the number ofalignment errors.3.4 Collecting judgmentsWe collected judgments using a web-based tool.Shared task participants were each asked to judge200 sets of sentences.
The sets consisted of 5 sys-tem outputs, as shown in Figure 3.
The judgeswere presented with batches of each type of eval-uation.
We presented them with five screens of ade-quacy/fluency scores, five screens of sentence rank-ings, and ten screens of constituent rankings.
Theorder of the types of evaluation were randomized.In order to measure intra-annotator agreement10% of the items were repeated and evaluated twiceby each judge.
In order to measure inter-annotatoragreement 40% of the items were randomly drawnfrom a common pool that was shared across all141http://www.statmt.org/wmt07/shared-task/judge/do_task.phpWMT07 Manual EvaluationRank SegmentsYou have judged 25 sentences for WMT07 German-English News Corpus, 190 sentences total taking 64.9 seconds per sentence.Source: K?nnen die USA ihre Besetzung aufrechterhalten, wenn sie dem irakischen Volk nicht Nahrung, Gesundheitsf?rsorge und anderegrundlegende Dienstleistungen anbieten k?nnen?Reference: Can the US sustain its occupation if it cannot provide food, health care, and other basic services to Iraq's people?Translation RankThe United States can maintain its employment when it the Iraqi people not food, health care and otherbasic services on offer?.1Worst2 3 4 5BestThe US can maintain its occupation, if they cannot offer the Iraqi people food, health care and other basicservices?1Worst2 3 4 5BestCan the US their occupation sustained if it to the Iraqi people not food, health care and other basicservices can offer?1Worst2 3 4 5BestCan the United States maintain their occupation, if the Iraqi people do not food, health care and otherbasic services can offer?1Worst2 3 4 5BestThe United States is maintained, if the Iraqi people, not food, health care and other basic services canoffer?1Worst2 3 4 5BestAnnotator: ccb Task: WMT07 German-English News CorpusInstructions:Rank each constituent translation from Best to Worst relative to the other choices (ties are allowed).

Shared taskparticipants were excluded from judging their ownsystems.Table 2 gives a summary of the number of judg-ments that we collected for translations of individ-ual sentences.
Since we had 14 translation tasks andfour different types of scores, there were 55 differ-ent conditions.2 In total we collected over 81,000judgments.
Despite the large number of conditionswe managed to collect more than 1,000 judgmentsfor most of them.
This provides a rich source of datafor analyzing the quality of translations produced bydifferent systems, the different types of human eval-uation, and the correlation of automatic metrics withhuman judgments.32We did not perform a constituent-based evaluation forCzech to English because we did not have a syntactic parserfor Czech.
We considered adapting our method to use Bojar(2004)?s dependency parser for Czech, but did not have the time.3The judgment data along with all system translations areavailable at http://www.statmt.org/wmt07/4 Automatic evaluationThe past two ACL workshops on machine trans-lation used Bleu as the sole automatic measure oftranslation quality.
Bleu was used exclusively sinceit is the most widely used metric in the field andhas been shown to correlate with human judgmentsof translation quality in many instances (Dodding-ton, 2002; Coughlin, 2003; Przybocki, 2004).
How-ever, recent work suggests that Bleu?s correlationwith human judgments may not be as strong as pre-viously thought (Callison-Burch et al, 2006).
Theresults of last year?s workshop further suggested thatBleu systematically underestimated the quality ofrule-based machine translation systems (Koehn andMonz, 2006).We used the manual evaluation data as a means oftesting the correlation of a range of automatic met-rics in addition to Bleu.
In total we used elevendifferent automatic evaluation measures to rank theshared task submissions.
They are:?

It flexibly matches wordsusing stemming and WordNet synonyms.
Itsflexible matching was extended to French,Spanish, German and Czech for this workshop(Lavie and Agarwal, 2007).?
Bleu (Papineni et al, 2002)?Bleu is currentlythe de facto standard in machine translationevaluation.
It calculates n-gram precision anda brevity penalty, and can make use of multi-ple reference translations as a way of capturingsome of the allowable variation in translation.We use a single reference translation in our ex-periments.?
GTM (Melamed et al, 2003)?GTM general-izes precision, recall, and F-measure to mea-sure overlap between strings, rather than over-lap between bags of items.
An ?exponent?
pa-rameter which controls the relative importanceof word order.
A value of 1.0 reduces GTM toordinary unigram overlap, with higher valuesemphasizing order.4?
Translation Error Rate (Snover et al, 2006)?4The GTM scores presented here are an F-measure with aweight of 0.1, which counts recall at 10x the level of precision.The exponent is set at 1.2, which puts a mild preference towardsitems with words in the correct order.
These parameters couldbe optimized empirically for better results.TER calculates the number of edits required tochange a hypothesis translation into a referencetranslation.
The possible edits in TER includeinsertion, deletion, and substitution of singlewords, and an edit which moves sequences ofcontiguous words.?
ParaEval precision and ParaEval recall (Zhouet al, 2006)?ParaEval matches hypothesis andreference translations using paraphrases thatare extracted from parallel corpora in an unsu-pervised fashion (Bannard and Callison-Burch,2005).
It calculates precision and recall using aunigram counting strategy.?
Dependency overlap (Amigo?
et al, 2006)?This metric uses dependency trees for the hy-pothesis and reference translations, by comput-ing the average overlap between words in thetwo trees which are dominated by grammaticalrelationships of the same type.?
Semantic role overlap (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez,2007)?This metric calculates the lexical over-lap between semantic roles (i.e., semantic argu-ments or adjuncts) of the same type in the thehypothesis and reference translations.
It uni-formly averages lexical overlap over all seman-tic role types.143?
Word Error Rate over verbs (Popovic and Ney,2007)?WER?
creates a new reference and anew hypothesis for each POS class by extract-ing all words belonging to this class, and thento calculate the standardWER.We show resultsfor this metric over verbs.?
Maximum correlation training on adequacy andon fluency (Liu and Gildea, 2007)?a lin-ear combination of different evaluation metrics(Bleu, Meteor, Rouge, WER, and stochastic it-erative alignment) with weights set to maxi-mize Pearson?s correlation with adequacy andfluency judgments.
Weights were trained onWMT-06 data.The scores produced by these are given in the ta-bles at the end of the paper, and described in Sec-tion 5.
We measured the correlation of the automaticevaluation metrics with the different types of humanjudgments on 12 data conditions, and report these inSection 6.5 Shared task resultsThe results of the human evaluation are given in Ta-bles 9, 10, 11 and 12.
Each of those tables presentfour scores:?
FLUENCY and ADEQUACY are normalized ver-sions of the five point scores described in Sec-tion 3.1.
The tables report an average of thenormalized scores.5?
RANK is the average number of times that asystem was judged to be better than any othersystem in the sentence ranking evaluation de-scribed in Section 3.2.?
CONSTITUENT is the average number of timesthat a system was judged to be better than anyother system in the constituent-based evalua-tion described in Section 3.3.There was reasonably strong agreement betweenthese four measures at which of the entries was thebest in each data condition.
There was complete5Since different annotators can vary widely in how they as-sign fluency and adequacy scores, we normalized these scoreson a per-judge basis using the method suggested by Blatz et al(2003) in Chapter 5, page 97.SYSTRAN (systran) 32%University of Edinburgh (uedin) 20%University of Catalonia (upc) 15%LIMSI-CNRS (limsi) 13%University of Maryland (umd) 5%National Research Council of Canada?sjoint entry with SYSTRAN (systran-nrc)5%Commercial Czech-English system (pct) 5%University of Valencia (upv) 2%Charles University (cu) 2%Table 3: The proportion of time that participants?entries were top-ranked in the human evaluationUniversity of Edinburgh (uedin) 41%University of Catalonia (upc) 12%LIMSI-CNRS (limsi) 12%University of Maryland (umd) 9%Charles University (cu) 4%Carnegie Mellon University (cmu-syntax) 4%Carnegie Mellon University (cmu-uka) 4%University of California at Berkeley (ucb) 3%National Research Council?s joint entrywith SYSTRAN (systran-nrc)2%SYSTRAN (systran) 2%Saarland University (saar) 0.8%Table 4: The proportion of time that participants?entries were top-ranked by the automatic evaluationmetricsagreement between them in 5 of the 14 conditions,and agreement between at least three of them in 10of the 14 cases.Table 3 gives a summary of how often differ-ent participants?

The complete set of results for the auto-matic evaluation are presented in Tables 13, 14, 15,and 16.
An aggregate summary is provided in Table4.
The automatic evaluation metrics strongly favorthe University of Edinburgh, which garners 41% ofthe top-ranked entries (which is partially due to thefact it was entered in every language pair).
Signif-icantly, the automatic metrics disprefer SYSTRAN,which was strongly favored in the human evaluation.6 Meta-evaluationIn addition to evaluating the translation quality ofthe shared task entries, we also performed a ?meta-evaluation?
of our evaluation methodologies.6.1 Inter- and Intra-annotator agreementWe measured pairwise agreement among annotatorsusing the kappa coefficient (K) which is widely usedin computational linguistics for measuring agree-ment in category judgments (Carletta, 1996).
It isdefined asK =P (A)?

For theranking tasks we calculated P (A) by examining allpairs of systems which had been judged by two ormore judges, and calculated the proportion of timethat they agreed that A > B, A = B, or A < B.For intra-annotator agreement we did similarly, butgathered items that were annotated on multiple oc-casions by a single annotator.Table 5 gives K values for inter-annotator agree-ment, and Table 6 gives K values for intra-annoatoragreement.
These give an indication of how oftendifferent judges agree, and how often single judgesare consistent for repeated judgments, respectively.The interpretation of Kappa varies, but according toLandis and Koch (1977) 0?
?.2 is slight, .21?
?.4is fair, .41?
?.6 is moderate, .61?
?.8 is substantialand the rest almost perfect.The K values for fluency and adequacy shouldgive us pause about using these metrics in the fu-ture.
When we analyzed them as they are intended tobe?scores classifying the translations of sentencesinto different types?the inter-annotator agreementwas barely considered fair, and the intra-annotatoragreement was only moderate.
Even when we re-assessed fluency and adequacy as relative ranks theagreements increased only minimally.14500.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080  10  20  30  40  50  60numsentencestakingthislong(%)time to judge one sentence (seconds)constituent ranksentence rankfluency+adequacy scoringFigure 4: Distributions of the amount of time it tookto judge single sentences for the three types of man-ual evaluationThe agreement on the other two types of man-ual evaluation that we introduced were considerablybetter.
The both the sentence and constituent rankinghad moderate inter-annotator agreement and sub-stantial intra-annotator agreement.
Because the con-stituent ranking examined the translations of shortphrases, often times all systems produced the sametranslations.
Since these trivially increased agree-ment (since they would always be equally ranked)we also evaluated the inter- and intra-annotatoragreement when those items were excluded.
Theagreement remained very high for constituent-basedevaluation.6.2 TimingWe used the web interface to collect timing infor-mation.
The server recorded the time when a set ofsentences was given to a judge and the time whenthe judge returned the sentences.
We divided thetime that it took to do a set by the number of sen-tences in the set.
The average amount of time that ittook to assign fluency and adequacy to a single sen-tence was 26 seconds.6 The average amount of timeit took to rank a sentence in a set was 20 seconds.The average amount of time it took to rank a high-lighted constituent was 11 seconds.
Figure 4 showsthe distribution of times for these tasks.6Sets which took longer than 5 minutes were excluded fromthese calculations, because there was a strong chance that anno-tators were interrupted while completing the task.These timing figures are promising because theyindicate that the tasks which the annotators were themost reliable on (constituent ranking and sentenceranking) were also much quicker to complete thanthe ones that they were unreliable on (assigning flu-ency and adequacy scores).
This suggests that flu-ency and adequacy should be replaced with rankingtasks in future evaluation exercises.6.3 Correlation between automatic metrics andhuman judgmentsTo measure the correlation of the automatic metricswith the human judgments of translation quality weused Spearman?s rank correlation coefficient ?.
Weopted for Spearman rather than Pearson because itmakes fewer assumptions about the data.
Impor-tantly, it can be applied to ordinal data (such as thefluency and adequacy scales).
Spearman?s rank cor-relation coefficient is equivalent to Pearson correla-tion on ranks.After the raw scores that were assigned to systemsby an automatic metric and by one of our manualevaluation techniques have been converted to ranks,we can calculate ?
using the simplified equation:?
= 1?6?d2in(n2 ?
1)where di is the difference between the rank forsystemi and n is the number of systems.
The pos-sible values of ?
range between 1 (where all systemsare ranked in the same order) and?1 (where the sys-tems are ranked in the reverse order).
Thus an auto-matic evaluation metric with a higher value for ?
ismaking predictions that are more similar to the hu-man judgments than an automatic evaluation metricwith a lower ?.Table 17 reports ?
for the metrics which wereused to evaluate translations into English.7.
Table7 summarizes the results by averaging the correla-tion numbers by equally weighting each of the dataconditions.
The table ranks the automatic evalua-tion metrics based on how well they correlated withhuman judgments.
While these are based on a rela-tively few number of items, and while we have notperformed any tests to determine whether the dif-ferences in ?
are statistically significant, the results7The Czech-English conditions were excluded since therewere so few systems146are nevertheless interesting, since three metrics havehigher correlation than Bleu:?
Semantic role overlap (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez,2007), which makes its debut in the proceed-ings of this workshop?
ParaEval measuring recall (Zhou et al, 2006),which has a model of allowable variation intranslation that uses automatically generatedparaphrases (Callison-Burch, 2007)?
Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) which alsoallows variation by introducing synonyms andby flexibly matches words using stemming.Tables 18 and 8 report ?
for the six metrics whichwere used to evaluate translations into the other lan-guages.
Here we find that Bleu and TER are theclosest to human judgments, but that overall the cor-relations are much lower than for translations intoEnglish.7 ConclusionsSimilar to last year?s workshop we carried out an ex-tensive manual and automatic evaluation of machinetranslation performance for translating from fourEuropean languages into English, and vice versa.This year we substantially increased the number ofautomatic evaluation metrics and were also able tonearly double the efforts of producing the humanjudgments.There were substantial differences in the resultsresults of the human and automatic evaluations.
Wetake the human judgments to be authoritative, andused them to evaluate the automatic metrics.
Wemeasured correlation using Spearman?s coefficientand found that three less frequently used metricswere stronger predictors of human judgments thanBleu.
They were: semantic role overlap (newly in-troduced in this workshop) ParaEval-recall and Me-teor.Although we do not claim that our observationsare indisputably conclusive, they again indicate thatthe choice of automatic metric can have a signifi-cant impact on comparing systems.
Understandingthe exact causes of those differences still remains animportant issue for future research.metric ADEQUACYFLUENCYRANKCONSTITUENTOVERALLSemanticrole overlap.774 .839 .803 .741 .789ParaEval-Recall.712 .742 .768 .798 .755Meteor .701 .719 .745 .669 .709Bleu .690 .722 .672 .602 .6711-TER .607 .538 .520 .514 .644Max adequ-correlation.651 .657 .659 .534 .626Max fluencycorrelation.644 .653 .656 .512 .616GTM .655 .674 .616 .495 .610Dependencyoverlap.639 .644 .601 .512 .599ParaEval-Precision.639 .654 .610 .491 .5981-WER ofverbs.378 .422 .431 .297 .382Table 7: Average corrections for the different auto-matic metrics when they are used to evaluate trans-lations into Englishmetric ADEQUACYFLUENCYRANKCONSTITUENTOVERALLBleu .657 .445 .352 .409 .4661-TER .589 .419 .361 .380 .437Max fluencycorrelation.534 .419 .368 .400 .430Max adequ-correlation.498 .414 .385 .409 .426Meteor .490 .356 .279 .304 .3571-WER ofverbs.371 .304 .359 .359 .348Table 8: Average corrections for the different auto-matic metrics when they are used to evaluate trans-lations into the other languages147This year?s evaluation also measured the agree-ment between human assessors by computing theKappa coefficient.
One striking observation isthat inter-annotator agreement for fluency and ad-equacy can be called ?fair?
at best.
On the otherhand, comparing systems by ranking them manually(constituents or entire sentences), resulted in muchhigher inter-annotator agreement.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported in part by the EuroMa-trix project funded by the European Commission(6th Framework Programme), and in part by theGALE program of the US Defense Advanced Re-search Projects Agency, Contract No.
