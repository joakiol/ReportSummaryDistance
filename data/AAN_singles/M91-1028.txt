NEW YORK UNIVERSIT YDESCRIPTION OF THE PROTEUS SYSTEM AS USED FOR MUC-3Ralph Grishman, John Sterling, and Catherine Macleo dThe PROTEUS Projec tComputer Science Departmen tNew York University715 Broadway, 7th FloorNew York, NY 10003(grishman,sterling,macleod)@cs .nyu.eduHISTORYThe PROTEUS system which we have used for MUC-3 has three main components : a syntactic analyzer, asemantic analyzer, and a template generator .The PROTEUS Syntactic Analyzer was developed starting in the fall of 1984 as a common base for all th eapplications of the PROTEUS Project.
Many aspects of its design reflect its heritage in the Linguistic Strin gParser, previously developed and still in use at New York University .
The current system, including the RestrictionLanguage compiler, the lexical analyzer, and the parser proper, comprise approximately 4500 lines of CommonLisp.The Semantic Analyzer was initially developed in 1987 for the MUCK-I (RAINFORMs) application ,extended for the MUCK-II (OPREPs) application, and further revised for the current evaluation .
It currently con-sists of about 3000 lines of Common Lisp (excluding the domain-specific information) .The Template Generator was written from scratch for the MUC-3 task; it is about 1200 lines of Commo nLisp.
.STAGES OF PROCESSIN GThe text goes through the five major stages of processing : lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, semanti canalysis, reference resolution, and template generation (see Figure 1) .
In addition, some restructuring of the logica lform is performed both after semantic analysis and after reference resolution (only the restructuring after referenc eresolution is shown in Figure 1) .
Processing is basically sequential : each sentence goes through lexical, syntactic ,and semantic analysis and reference resolution ; the logical form for the entire message is then fed to template gen-eration .
However, semantic (selectional) checking is performed during syntactic analysis, employing essentiall ythe same code later used for semantic analysis .Each of these stages is described in a section which follows .LEXICAL ANALYSISDictionary Forma tOur dictionaries contain only syntactic information : the parts of speech for each word, information about thecomplement structure of verbs, distributional information (e .g ., for adjectives and adverbs), etc .
We follow closelythe set of syntactic features established for the NYU Linguistic String Parser .
This information is entered in LIS Pform using noun, verb, adjective, and adverb macros for the open-class words, and a word macrofor other parts of speech :(ADVERB "ABRUPTLY" :ATTRIBUTES (DSA) )(ADJECTIVE "ABRUPT" )(NOUN :ROOT "ABSCESS" :ATTRIBUTES (NCOUNT) )183Knowledge SourcesTextDictionaryGramma rSemantic ModelsConcept Hier.Lexical Analysi sSyntax Analysi sSemantic Analysi sReference Resolutio nMapping Rules LF TransformationTemplate Generation- Template sFigure 1 .
Structure of the Proteus System as used for MUC- 3(VERB :ROOT "ABSCOND" :OBJLIST (NULLOBJ PN (PVAL (FROM WITH))) )The noun and verb macros automatically generate the regular inflectional forms .Dictionary FilesThe primary source of our dictionary information about open-class words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, an dadverbs) is the machine-readable version of the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary ("OALD") .
We have writ-ten programs which take the SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) version of the dictionary, extrac tinformation on inflections, parts of speech, and verb subcategorization (including information on adverbial parti-cles and prepositions gleaned from the examples), and generate the LISP-ified form shown above .
This is supple-mented by a manually-coded dictionary (about 500 lines) for closed-class words and a few very common words .184For MUC-3 we used several additional dictionaries .
There was a dictionary (about 800 lines) for Englis hwords not defined in the OALD, or not adequately defined or too richly defined there .
In addition, we extractedfrom the text and templates lists of organizations, locations, and proper names, and prepared small dictionaries fo reach (about 2000 lines total) .LookupThe text reader splits the input text into tokens and then attempts to assign to each token (or sequence oftokens, in the case of an idiom) a definition (part of speech and syntactic attributes) .
The matching proces sproceeds in four steps: dictionary lookup, lexical pattern matching, spelling correction, and prefix stripping .
Dic-tionary lookup immediately retrieves definitions assigned by any of the dictionaries (including inflected forms) ,while lexical pattern matching is used to identify a variety of specialized patterns, such as numbers, dates, times ,and possessive forms .If neither dictionary lookup nor lexical pattern matching is successful, spelling correction and prefix strippin gare attempted .
Based on an analysis of the errors we found, we have used for MUC-3 a rather conservative spel-ling corrector, which identifies an input token as a misspelled form of a dictionary entry only if one of the two has asingle instance of a letter while the other has a doubled instance of the letter (e .g ., "mispelled" and "misspelled") .
1The prefix stripper attempts to identify the token as a combination of a prefix and a word defined in the dic-tionary .
We currently use a list of 17 prefixes, including standard English ones like "un" and MUC-3 specials like"narco-" .If all of these procedures fail, the word is tagged as a proper noun (name), since we found that most of ourremaining undefined words were names .FilteringIn order to avoid full processing of sentences which would make no contribution to the templates, we per -form a keyword-based filtering at the sentence level : if a sentence contains no key terms, it is skipped.
This filter-ing is done after lexical analysis because the lexical analysis has identified the root form of all inflected words ;these root forms provide links into the semantic hierarchy .
The filtering can therefore be specified in terms of asmall number of word classes, one of which must be present for the sentence to be worth processing .SYNTACTIC ANALYSISSyntactic analysis involves two stages of processing : parsing and syntactic regularization.
At the core of thesystem is an active chart parser.
The grammar is an augmented context-free grammar, consisting of BNF rules plu sprocedural restrictions which check grammatical constraints not easily captured in the BNF rules .
Most restrictionsare stated in PROTEUS Restriction Language (a variant of the language developed for the Linguistic String Parser )and translated into LISP; a few are coded directly in LISP [1] .
For example, the count noun restriction (that singu-lar countable nouns have a determiner) is stated asWCOUNT = IN LNR AFTER NVAR :IF BOTH CORE Xcore IS NCOUNT AND Xcore IS SINGULA RTHEN IN LN, TPOS IS NOT EMPTY .Associated with each BNF rule is a regularization rule, which computes the regularized form of each node i nthe parse tree from the regularized forms of its immediate constituents .
These regularization rules are based onlambda-reduction, as in GPSG.
The primary function of syntactic regularization is to reduce all clauses to a stan-dard form consisting of aspect and tense markers, the operator (verb or adjective), and syntactically marked cases .For example, the definition of assertion, the basic S structure in our grammar, i s<assertion>: := <sa> <subject> <sa> <verb> <sa> <object> <sa >:(s !
(<object> <subject> <verb> <sa*>)) .Here the portion after the single colon defines the regularized structure .The more standard corrector we used for MUCK-2, which allowed for any single insertion, deletion, transposition, or substitution, gav etoo many incorrect matches .185Coordinate conjunction is introduced by a metarule (as in GPSG), which is applied to the context-free com-ponents of the grammar prior to parsing .
The regularization procedure expands any conjunction into a conjuntio nof clauses or of noun phrases .The output of the parser for the first sentence of DEV-0099, "POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT TER-RORISTS TONIGHT BOMBED THE EMBASSIES OF THE PRC AND THE SOVIET UNION . "
, is(SENTENCE(CENTERS(CENTER(ASSERTION (SUBJECT (NSTG (LNR (NVAR (N "POLICE")))) )(VERB (LTVR (TV "HAVE")) )(OBJECT(VENO (LVENR (VEN "REPORTED") )(OBJECT(THATS ("THAT" "THAT" )(ASSERTION (SUBJECT (NSTG (LNR (NVAR (N "TERRORISTS")))) )(SA (SA-VAL (NSTGT (NSTG (LNF: (NVAR (N "TONIGHT")))))) )(VERB (LTVR (TV "BOMBED")) )(OBJECT(NSTGO(NSTG(LNR (LN (TPOS (LTR (T "THE")))) (NVAR (N "EMBASSIES") )(RN(RN-VAL(PN (P "OF" )(NSTGO(NSTG(LNR(LNR (LN (TPOS (LTR (T "THE"))) )(NVAR (NAMESTG (LNAMER (N "PRC")))) )(CONJ-WORD ("AND" "AND") )(LNR (LN (TPOS (LTR (T "THE"))) )(NVAR (NAMESTG (LNAMER (N "SOVIET" "UNION")))))))))))))))))))))) )(ENDMARK (" ."
" ")) )and the corresponding regularized structure is(S PERF REPORT (SUBJECT (NP POLICE PLURAL (SN NP1227)) )(OBJECT(S PAST BOMB (SUBJECT (NP TERRORIST PLURAL (SN NP1238)) )(OBJECT(NP EMBASSY PLURAL (SN NP1242) (T-POS THE )(OF(AND (NP PRC SINGULAR (SN NP1231) (T-POS THE) )(NP USSR SINGULAR (SN NP1235) (T-POS THE))))) )(PREP (NP TONIGHT SINGULAR (SN NP1237))))) )The system uses a chart parser operating top-down, left-to-right.
As edges are completed (i .e., as nodes ofthe parse tree are built), restrictions associated with those productions are invoked to assign and test features of th eparse tree nodes .
If a restriction fails, that edge is not added to the chart .
When certain levels of the tree are com-plete (those producing noun phrase and clause structures), the regularization rules are invoked to compute a regu-larized structure for the partial parse, and selection is invoked to verify the semantic well-formedness of the struc-ture (as noted earlier, selection uses the same "semantic analysis" code subsequently employed to translate the tre einto logical form) .One unusual feature of the parser is its weighting capability .
Restrictions may assign scores to nodes ; theparser will perform a best-first search for the parse tree with the highest score .
This scoring is used to implementvarious preference mechanisms :186?
closest attachment of modifiers (we penalize each modifier by the number of words separating it from it shead)?
preferred narrow conjoining for clauses (we penalize a conjoined clause structure by the number of words i tsubsumes)?
preference semantics (selection does not reject a structure, but imposes a heavy penalty if the structure doe snot match any lexico-semantic model, and a lesser penalty if the structure matches a model but with som eoperands or modifiers left over) [2,3 ]?
relaxation of certain syntactic constraints, such as the count noun constraint, adverb position constraints, an dcomma constraints?
disfavoring (penalizing) headless noun phrases and headless relatives (this is important for parsin gefficiency)The grammar is based on Harris's Linguistic String Theory and adapted from the larger Linguistic Strin gParser (LSP) grammar developed by Naomi Sager at NYU [4] .
The grammar is gradually being enlarged to cove rmore of the LSP grammar .
The current grammar is 1200 lines of BNF and Restriction Language plus 300 lines ofLisp; it includes 150 non-terminals, 365 productions, and 103 restrictions .Over the course of MUC-2 and MUC-3 we have added several mechanisms for recovering from sentence sthe grammar cannot fully parse ; these are described in our site report.SEMANTIC ANALYSIS AND REFERENCE RESOLUTIONThe output of syntactic analysis goes through semantic analysis and reference resolution and is then added t othe accumulating logical form for the message .
Following both semantic analysis and reference resolution certai ntransformations are performed to simplify the logical form .
All of this processing makes use of a concept hierarch ywhich captures the class/subclass/instance relations in the domain .Semantic analysis uses a set of lexico-semantic models to map the regularized syntactic analysis into asemantic representation.
Each model specifies a class of verbs, adjectives, or nouns and a set of operands ; for eac hoperand it indicates the possible syntactic case markers, the semantic class of the operand, whether or not theoperand is required, and the semantic case to be assigned to the operand in the output representation .
For example ,the model for "<explosive-object> damages <target> " is(add-clause-model :id 'clause-damage-3:parent 'clause-any:constraint 'damage:operands (list (make-specifie r:marker 'subject:class 'explosive-objec t:case :instrument )(make-specifier:marker 'object:class 'target-entity:case :patient:essential-required 'required)) )The models are arranged in a shallow hierarchy with inheritance, so that arguments and modifiers which are share dby a class of verbs need only be stated once .
The model above inherits only from the most general clause model ,clause-any, which includes general clausal modifiers such as negation, time, tense, modality, etc .
Theevaluated MUC-3 system had 98 clause models, 14 nominalization models, and 31 other noun phrase models, atotal of about 2000 lines .
The class explosive-object in the clause model refers to the concept in the con -cept hierarchy, whose entries have the form :(defconcept explosive-object :typeof instrument-type )(defconcept explosive :typeof explosive-objec t:muctype explosive )(defconcept grenade :typeof explosive )(defconcept explosive-charge :typeof explosive18 7:alias (dynamite-charge) )(defconcept bomb:typeof explosive-objec t:muctype bomb )(defconcept 'VEHICLE BOMB':typeof explosive-objec t:muctype 'VEHICLE BOMBI )(defconcept car-bomb:typeof 'VEHICLE BOMBI )(defconcept bus-bomb:typeof 'VEHICLE BOMBI )(defconcept dynamite:typeof explosive-objec t:alias tnt:muctype DYNAMITE )There are currently a total of 2098 concepts in the hierarchy, of which 1439 are place names .The output of semantic analysis is a nested set of entity and event structures, with arguments labeled by key-words primarily designating semantic roles .
For the first sentence of DEV-0099, the output is(EVENT:TENSE-ASPECT (PERF ):IDENTIFIER E000000008 5:TOP-LEVEL-FLAG T:PREDICATE REPORT:AGENT (ENTITY:SN NP1227:SET T:IDENTIFIER N000000008 6:CLASS POLICE ):EVENT (EVENT:TENSE-ASPECT (PAST ):IDENTIFIER E000000008 7TOP-LEVEL-FLAG NI LPREDICATE BOMB-EVENT:AGENT (ENTITY:SN NP123 8:SET T:IDENTIFIER N000000008 9:CLASS TERRORIST ):PATIENT (ENTIT Y:NATIONALITY (ENTITY:IDENTIFIER N000000009 3:CLASS (COUNTRY-NAME COUNTRY ):SET T:MEMBERS ((ENTIT Y:SN NP123 1:IDENTIFIER N000000009 1:CLASS PRC )(ENTITY:SN NP123 5:IDENTIFIER N000000009 2:CLASS USSR)) ):SN NP124 2:SET T:IDENTIFIER N000000009 0:CLASS EMBASSY )INSTRUMENT (ENTITY:ZEROED-P T:IDENTIFIER N000000008 8:CLASS EXPLOSIVE-OBJECT ):DATE (ENTITY188:SN NP123 7:IDENTIFIER N000000009 4:CLASS TONIGHT)) )Reference ResolutionReference resolution is applied to the output of semantic analysis in order to replace anaphoric noun phrases(representing either events or entities) by appropriate antecedents .
Each potential anaphor is compared to priorentities or events, looking for a suitable antecedent such that the class of the anaphor (in the concept hierarchy) isequal to or more general than that of the antecedent, the anaphor and antecedent match in number, the restrictiv emodifiers in the anaphor have corresponding arguments in the antecedent, and the non-restrictive modifiers (e .g .
,apposition) of the anaphor are not inconsistent with those of the antecedent .
Special tests are provided for names(people may be referred to a subset of their names) and for referring to groups by typical members ("terrorist force ".
.
.
"terrorists").
Some further discussion of reference resolution and the subsequent process of template merging i sincluded in a separate paper on discourse analysis in this volume ("Computational Aspects of Discourse in the Con -text of MUC-3") .Logical Form TransformationsThe transformations which are applied after semantic analysis and after reference resolution simplify andregularize the logical form in various ways .
For example, if a verb governs an argument of a nominalization, th eargument is inserted into the event created from the nominalization: "x conducts the attack", "x claims responsibil-ity for the attack", "x was accused of the attack" etc .
are all mapped to "x attacks" (with appropriate settings of th econfidence slot) .
For example, the rule to take "X was accused of Y" and make X the agent of Y i s(((event :predicate accusation?event:agent ?agent- 1:event (event :identifier ?id-1 .
?R2 ).
?R1 )(event :identifier ?id-1 .
?R4) )->((modify 2 '( :agent ?agent-1 :confidence [SUSPECTED OR ACCUSEDI) )(delete 1)) )Transformations are also used to expand conjoined structures .
For example, the rule to take "<entity> of(<country-1> and <country-2>)" and expand it to "(<entity> of <country-1>) and (<entity> of <country-2>)" i s(((entity:nationality(entity:members(?P1 ?P2).?R1).
?R2) )->((modify 1 '( :nationality ni l:set t:members((entity :nationality ?P1:set nil.
?R2 )(entity :nationality ?P2:set nil.
?R2))))))This rule is used in message TST1-0099, for example, to expand THE EMBASSIES OF THE PRC AND THESOVIET UNION into THE EMBASSY OF THE PRC AND THE EMBASSY OF THE SOVIET UNION .There are currently 32 such rules .
These transformations are written as productions and applied using a sim-ple data-driven production system interpreter which is part of the PROTEUS system .TEMPLATE GENERATOROnce all the sentences in an article have been processed through syntactic and semantic analysis, the result-ing logical forms are sent to the template generator.
The template generator operates in four stages .
First, a framestructure resembling a simplified template (with incident-type, perpetrator, physical-target, human-target, date ,location, instrument, physical-effect, and human-effect slots) is generated for each event .
Date and locatio nexpressions are reduced to a normalized form at this point .
In particular, date expressions such as "tonight", " las tmonth", "last April", "a year ago", etc .
are replaced by explicit dates or date ranges, based on the dateline of th earticle.
Second, a series of heuristics attempt to merge these frames, mergin g18 9o frames referring to a common target?frames arising from the same sentence?
an effect frame following an attack frame (e .g ., "The FMLN attacked the town.
Seven civilians died . "
)This merging is blocked if the dates or locations are different, the incident types are incompatible, or the perpetra-tors are incompatible.
Third, a series of filters removes frames involving only military targets and those involvin gevents more than two months old .
Finally, MUC templates are generated from these frames .REFERENCE S[1] Grishman, R .
