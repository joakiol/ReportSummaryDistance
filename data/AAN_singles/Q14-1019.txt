Entity Linking meets Word Sense Disambiguation: a Unified ApproachAndrea Moro, Alessandro Raganato, Roberto NavigliDipartimento di Informatica,Sapienza Universita` di Roma,Viale Regina Elena 295, 00161 Roma, Italy{moro,navigli}@di.uniroma1.itale.raganato@gmail.comAbstractEntity Linking (EL) and Word Sense Disam-biguation (WSD) both address the lexical am-biguity of language.
But while the two tasksare pretty similar, they differ in a fundamen-tal respect: in EL the textual mention can belinked to a named entity which may or may notcontain the exact mention, while in WSD thereis a perfect match between the word form (bet-ter, its lemma) and a suitable word sense.In this paper we present Babelfy, a unifiedgraph-based approach to EL and WSD basedon a loose identification of candidate mean-ings coupled with a densest subgraph heuris-tic which selects high-coherence semantic in-terpretations.
Our experiments show state-of-the-art performances on both tasks on 6 differ-ent datasets, including a multilingual setting.Babelfy is online at http://babelfy.org1 IntroductionThe automatic understanding of the meaning of texthas been a major goal of research in computationallinguistics and related areas for several decades,with ambitious challenges, such as Machine Read-ing (Etzioni et al., 2006) and the quest for knowl-edge (Schubert, 2006).
Word Sense Disambiguation(WSD) (Navigli, 2009; Navigli, 2012) is a historicaltask aimed at assigning meanings to single-word andmulti-word occurrences within text, a task which ismore alive than ever in the research community.Recently, the collaborative creation of large semi-structured resources, such as Wikipedia, and knowl-edge resources built from them (Hovy et al., 2013),such as BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012a),DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007) and YAGO2 (Hoffartet al., 2013), has favoured the emergence of newtasks, such as Entity Linking (EL) (Rao et al., 2013),and opened up new possibilities for tasks such asNamed Entity Disambiguation (NED) and Wikifi-cation.
The aim of EL is to discover mentions ofentities within a text and to link them to the mostsuitable entry in a reference knowledge base.
How-ever, in contrast to WSD, a mention may be partialwhile still being unambiguous thanks to the context.For instance, consider the following sentence:(1) Thomas and Mario are strikers playing in Munich.This example makes it clear how intertwined thetwo tasks of WSD and EL are.
In fact, on the onehand, striker and play are polysemous words whichcan be disambiguated by selecting the game/soccerplaying senses of the two words in a dictionary; onthe other hand, Thomas and Mario are partial men-tions which have to be linked to the appropriate en-tries of a knowledge base, that is, Thomas Mu?llerand Mario Gomez, two well-known soccer players.The two main differences between WSD and ELlie, on the one hand, in the kind of inventory used,i.e., dictionary vs. encyclopedia, and, on the otherhand, in the assumption that the mention is completeor potentially partial.
Notwithstanding these differ-ences, the tasks are similar in nature, in that theyboth involve the disambiguation of textual fragmentsaccording to a reference inventory.
However, the re-search community has so far tackled the two tasksseparately, often duplicating efforts and solutions.In contrast to this trend, research in knowledgeacquisition is now heading towards the seamless in-231Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2 (2014) 231?244.

c?2014 Association for Computational Linguistics.tegration of encyclopedic and lexicographic knowl-edge into structured language resources (Hovy et al.,2013), and the main representative of this new direc-tion is undoubtedly BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto,2012a).
Given such structured language resources itseems natural to suppose that they might provide acommon ground for the two tasks of WSD and EL.More precisely, in this paper we explore the hy-pothesis that the lexicographic knowledge used inWSD is also useful for tackling the EL task, and,vice versa, that the encyclopedic information uti-lized in EL helps disambiguate nominal mentions ina WSD setting.
We propose Babelfy, a novel, uni-fied graph-based approach to WSD and EL, whichperforms two main steps: i) it exploits random walkswith restart, and triangles as a support for reweight-ing the edges of a large semantic network; ii) it usesa densest subgraph heuristic on the available seman-tic interpretations of the input text to perform a jointdisambiguation with both concepts and named enti-ties.
Our experiments show the benefits of our syn-ergistic approach on six gold-standard datasets.2 Related Work2.1 Word Sense DisambiguationWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the task ofchoosing the right sense for a word within a givencontext.
Typical approaches for this task can be clas-sified as i) supervised, ii) knowledge-based, and iii)unsupervised.
However, supervised approaches re-quire huge amounts of annotated data (Zhong andNg, 2010; Shen et al., 2013; Pilehvar and Navigli,2014), an effort which cannot easily be repeatedfor new domains and languages, while unsupervisedones suffer from data sparsity and an intrinsic diffi-culty in their evaluation (Agirre et al., 2006; Brodyand Lapata, 2009; Manandhar et al., 2010; Van deCruys and Apidianaki, 2011; Di Marco and Nav-igli, 2013).
On the other hand, knowledge-basedapproaches are able to obtain good performance us-ing readily-available structured knowledge (Agirreet al., 2010; Guo and Diab, 2010; Ponzetto and Nav-igli, 2010; Miller et al., 2012; Agirre et al., 2014).Some of these approaches marginally take into ac-count the structural properties of the knowledge base(Mihalcea, 2005).
Other approaches, instead, lever-age the structural properties of the knowledge baseby exploiting centrality and connectivity measures(Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007; Tsatsaronis et al., 2007;Agirre and Soroa, 2009; Navigli and Lapata, 2010).One of the key steps of many knowledge-basedWSD algorithms is the creation of a graph repre-senting the semantic interpretations of the input text.Two main strategies to build this graph have beenproposed: i) exploiting the direct connections, i.e.,edges, between the considered sense candidates; ii)populating the graph according to (shortest) pathsbetween them.
In our approach we manage to unifythese two strategies by automatically creating edgesbetween sense candidates performing Random Walkwith Restart (Tong et al., 2006).The recent upsurge of interest in multilingualityhas led to the development of cross-lingual and mul-tilingual approaches to WSD (Lefever and Hoste,2010; Lefever and Hoste, 2013; Navigli et al., 2013).Multilinguality has been exploited in different ways,e.g., by using parallel corpora to build multilingualcontexts (Guo and Diab, 2010; Banea and Mihalcea,2011; Lefever et al., 2011) or by means of ensemblemethods which exploit complementary sense evi-dence from translations in different languages (Nav-igli and Ponzetto, 2012b).
In this work, we presenta novel exploitation of the structural properties of amultilingual semantic network.2.2 Entity LinkingEntity Linking (Erbs et al., 2011; Rao et al., 2013;Cornolti et al., 2013) encompasses a set of similartasks, which include Named Entity Disambiguation(NED), that is the task of linking entity mentionsin a text to a knowledge base (Bunescu and Pasca,2006; Cucerzan, 2007), and Wikification, i.e., theautomatic annotation of text by linking its relevantfragments of text to the appropriate Wikipedia arti-cles.
Mihalcea and Csomai (2007) were the first totackle the Wikification task.
In their approach theydisambiguate each word in a sentence independentlyby exploiting the context in which it occurs.
How-ever, this approach is local in that it lacks a collectivenotion of coherence between the selected Wikipediapages.
To overcome this problem, Cucerzan (2007)introduced a global approach based on the simulta-neous disambiguation of all the terms in a text andthe use of lexical context to disambiguate the men-tions.
To maximize the semantic agreement Milne232and Witten (2008) introduced the analysis of the se-mantic relations between the candidate senses andthe unambiguous context, i.e., words with a singlesense candidate.
However, the performance of thisalgorithm depends heavily on the number of linksincident to the target senses and on the availabil-ity of unambiguous words within the input text.
Toovercome this issue a novel class of approaches havebeen proposed (Kulkarni et al., 2009; Ratinov et al.,2011; Hoffart et al., 2011) that exploit global andlocal features.
However, these systems either relyon a difficult NP-hard formalization of the problemwhich is infeasible for long text, or exploit popular-ity measures which are domain-dependent.
In con-trast, we show that the semantic network structurecan be leveraged to obtain state-of-the-art perfor-mance by synergistically disambiguating both wordsenses and named entities at the same time.Recently, the explosion of on-line social network-ing services, such as Twitter and Facebook, havecontributed to the development of new methods forthe efficient disambiguation of short texts (Ferrag-ina and Scaiella, 2010; Hoffart et al., 2012; Bo?hm etal., 2012).
Thanks to a loose candidate identificationtechnique coupled with a densest subgraph heuristic,we show that our approach is particularly suited forshort and highly ambiguous text disambiguation.2.3 The Best of Two WorldsOur main goal is to bring together the two worlds ofWSD and EL.
On the one hand, this implies relaxingthe constraint of a perfect association between men-tions and meanings, which is, instead, assumed inWSD.
On the other hand, this relaxation leads to theinherent difficulty of encoding a full-fledged senseinventory for EL.
Our solution to this problem is tokeep the set of candidate meanings for a given men-tion as open as possible (see Section 6), so as to en-able high recall in linking partial mentions, whileproviding an effective method for handling this highambiguity (see Section 7).A key assumption of our work is that the lexico-graphic knowledge used in WSD is also useful fortackling the EL task, and vice versa the encyclopedicinformation utilized in EL helps disambiguate nom-inal mentions in a WSD setting.
We enable the jointtreatment of concepts and named entities by enforc-ing high coherence in our semantic interpretations.3 WSD and Entity Linking TogetherTask.
Our task is to disambiguate and link allnominal and named entity mentions occurringwithin a text.
The linking task is performed by asso-ciating each mention with the most suitable entry ofa given knowledge base.1We point out that our definition is unconstrainedin terms of what to link, i.e., unlike Wikification andWSD, we can link overlapping fragments of text.For instance, given the text fragment Major LeagueSoccer, we identify and disambiguate several dif-ferent nominal and entity mentions: Major LeagueSoccer, major league, league and soccer.
In contrastto EL, we link not only named entity mentions, suchas Major League Soccer, but also nominal mentions,e.g., major league, to their corresponding meaningsin the knowledge base.Babelfy.
We provide a unified approach to WSDand entity linking in three steps:1.
Given a lexicalized semantic network, we as-sociate with each vertex, i.e., either concept ornamed entity, a semantic signature, that is, a setof related vertices (Section 5).
This is a prelim-inary step which needs to be performed onlyonce, independently of the input text.2.
Given a text, we extract all the linkable frag-ments from this text and, for each of them, listthe possible meanings according to the seman-tic network (Section 6).3.
We create a graph-based semantic interpreta-tion of the whole text by linking the candidatemeanings of the extracted fragments using thepreviously-computed semantic signatures.
Wethen extract a dense subgraph of this represen-tation and select the best candidate meaning foreach fragment (Section 7).4 Semantic NetworkOur approach requires the availability of a wide-coverage semantic network which encodes struc-tural and lexical information both of an encyclope-dic and of a lexicographic kind.
Although in prin-ciple any semantic network with these properties1Mentions which are not contained in the reference knowl-edge base are not taken into account.233could be utilized, in our work we used the Babel-Net2 1.1.1 semantic network (Navigli and Ponzetto,2012a) since it is the largest multilingual knowl-edge base, obtained from the automatic seamlessintegration of Wikipedia3 and WordNet (Fellbaum,1998).
We consider BabelNet as a directed multi-graph which contains both concepts and named en-tities as its vertices and a multiset of semantic rela-tions as its edges.
We leverage the multilingual lex-icalizations of the vertices of BabelNet to identifymentions in the input text.
For example, the entityFC Bayern Munich can be lexicalized in differentlanguages, e.g., F.C.
Bayern de Mu?nich in Spanish,Die Roten in English and Bayern Mu?nchen in Ger-man, among others.
As regards semantic relations,the only information we use is that of the end points,i.e., vertices, that these relations connect, while ne-glecting the relation type.5 Building Semantic SignaturesOne of the major issues affecting both manually-curated and automatically constructed semantic net-works is data sparsity.
For instance, we calculatedthat the average number of incident edges is roughly10 in WordNet, 50 in BabelNet and 80 in YAGO2,to mention a few.
Although automatically-built re-sources typically provide larger amounts of edges,two issues have to be taken into account: conceptswhich should be related might not be directly con-nected despite being structurally close within thenetwork, and, vice versa, weakly-related or even un-related concepts can be erroneously connected by anedge.
For instance, in BabelNet we do not have anedge between playmaker and Thomas Mu?ller, whilewe have an incorrect edge connecting FC BayernMunich and Yellow Submarine (song).
However,this crisp notion of relatedness can be overcome byexploiting the global structure of the semantic net-work, thereby obtaining a more precise and higher-coverage measure of relatedness.
We address thisissue in two steps: first, we provide a structuralweighting of the network?s edges; second, for eachvertex we create a set of related vertices using ran-dom walks with restart.2http://babelnet.org3http://www.wikipedia.orgStructural weighting.
Our first objective is to as-sign higher weights to edges which are involved inmore densely connected areas of the directed net-work.
To this end, inspired by the local cluster-ing coefficient measure (Watts and Strogatz, 1998)and its recent success in Word Sense Induction(Di Marco and Navigli, 2013), we use directed tri-angles, i.e., directed cycles of length 3, and weighteach edge (v, v?)
by the number of directed trianglesit occurs in:weight(v, v?)
:= |{(v, v?, v??)
: (v, v?
), (1)(v?, v??
), (v?
?, v) ?
E}|+ 1We add one to each weight to ensure the highest de-gree of reachability in the network.Random Walk with Restart.
Our goal is to cre-ate a semantic signature (i.e., a set of highly relatedvertices) for each concept and named entity of thesemantic network.
To do this, we perform a RandomWalk with Restart (RWR) (Tong et al., 2006), that is,a stochastic process that starts from an initial vertexof the graph4 and then, for a fixed number n of stepsor until convergence, explores the graph by choos-ing the next vertex within the current neighborhoodor by restarting from the initial vertex with a given,fixed restart probability ?.
For each edge (v, v?)
inthe network, we model the conditional probabilityP (v?|v) as the normalized weight of the edge:P (v?|v) = weight(v, v?)?v??
?V weight(v, v??
)where V is the set of vertices of the semantic net-work and weight(v, v?)
is the function defined inEquation 1.
We then run the RWR from each ver-tex v of the semantic network for a fixed number nof steps (we show in Algorithm 1 our RWR pseu-docode).
We keep track of the encountered ver-tices using the map counts, i.e., we increase thecounter associated with vertex v?
in counts everytime we hit v?
during a RWR started from v (seeline 11).
As a result, we obtain a frequency distri-bution over the whole set of concepts and entities.To eliminate weakly-related vertices we keep onlythose items that were hit at least ?
times (see lines16?18).
Finally, we save the remaining vertices inthe set semSignv which is the semantic signatureof v (see line 19).4RWR can be used with an initial set of vertices, however inthis paper we use a single initial vertex.234Algorithm 1 Random walk with restart.1: input: v, the starting vertex;?, the restart probability;n, the number of steps to be executed;P , the transition probabilities;?, the frequency threshold.2: output: semSignv , set of related vertices for v.3: function RWR(v, ?, n, P, ?

We now turn to the candidateidentification and disambiguation steps.6 Candidate IdentificationGiven a text as input, we apply part-of-speech tag-ging and identify the set F of all the textual frag-ments, i.e., all the sequences of words of maximumlength five, which contain at least one noun and thatare substrings of lexicalizations in BabelNet, i.e.,those fragments that can potentially be linked to anentry in BabelNet.
For each textual fragment f ?
F ,i.e., a single- or multi-word expression of the inputtext, we look up the semantic network for candidatemeanings, i.e., vertices that contain f or, only fornamed entities, a superstring of f as their lexical-ization.
For instance, for sentence (1) in the intro-duction, we identify the following textual fragments:Thomas, Mario, strikers, Munich.
This output is ob-tained thanks to our loose candidate identificationroutine, i.e., based on superstring matching insteadof exact matching, which, for instance, enables us torecognize the right candidate Mario Gomez for themention Mario even if this named entity does nothave Mario as one of its lexicalizations (for an anal-ysis of the impact of this routine against the exactmatching approach see the discussion in Section 9).Moreover, as we stated in Section 3, we allowoverlapping fragments, e.g., for major league werecognize league and major league.
We denote withcand(f) the set of all the candidate meanings offragment f .
For instance, for the noun league wehave that cand(league) contains among others thesport word sense and the TV series named entity.7 Candidate DisambiguationSemantic interpretation graph.
After the identi-fication of fragments (F ) and their candidate mean-ings (cand(?
)), we create a directed graph GI =(VI , EI) of the semantic interpretations of the inputtext.
We show the pseudocode in Algorithm 2.
VIcontains all the candidate meanings of all fragments,that is, VI := {(v, f) : v ?
cand(f), f ?
F}, wheref is a fragment of the input text and v is a candidateBabel synset that has a lexicalization which is equalto or is a superstring of f (see lines 4?8).
The setof edges EI connects related meanings and is pop-ulated as follows: we add an edge from (v, f) to(v?, f ?)
if and only if f 6= f ?
and v?
?
semSignv(see lines 9?11).
In other words, we connect twocandidate meanings of different fragments if one isin the semantic signature of the other.
For instance,we add an edge between (Mario Gomez, Mario) and(Thomas Mu?ller, Thomas), while we do not add onebetween (Mario Gomez, Mario) and (Mario Basler,Mario) since these are two candidate meanings ofthe same fragment, i.e., Mario.
In Figure 1, we showan excerpt of our graph for sentence (1).At this point we have a graph-based representa-tion of all the possible interpretations of the inputtext.
In order to drastically reduce the degree of am-biguity while keeping the interpretation coherenceas high as possible, we apply a novel densest sub-graph heuristic (see line 12), whose description wedefer to the next paragraph.
The result is a sub-graph which contains those semantic interpretationsthat are most coherent to each other.
However, thissubgraph might still contain multiple interpretationsfor the same fragment, and even unambiguous frag-ments which are not correct.
Therefore, the final235(Toma?s Milia?n, Thomas)(Thomas Mu?ller, Thomas)(forward, striker)(striker, striker) (FC Bayern Munich, Munich)(Munich, Munich)(Mario Adorf, Mario)(Mario Basler, Mario)(Mario Gomez, Mario)Figure 1: An excerpt of the semantic interpretation graph automatically built for the sentence Thomas and Mario arestrikers playing in Munich (the edges connecting the correct meanings are in bold).step is the selection of the most suitable candidatemeaning for each fragment f given a threshold ?

), (v, f)) ?

1The rationale behind this scoring function is totake into account both the semantic coherence, us-ing a graph centrality measure among the candidatemeanings, and the lexical coherence, in terms of thenumber of fragments a candidate relates to.Finally, we link each f to the highest ranking can-didate meaning v?
if score((v?, f)) ?
?, where ?
isa fixed threshold (see lines 14?18 of Algorithm 2).For instance, in sentence (1) and for the fragmentMario we select Mario Gomez as our final candidatemeaning and link it to the fragment.Linking by densest subgraph.
We now illustrateour novel densest subgraph heuristic, used in line 12of Algorithm 2, for reducing the level of ambiguityof the initial semantic interpretation graph GI .
Themain idea here is that the most suitable meanings ofeach text fragment will belong to the densest area ofthe graph.
For instance, in Figure 1 the (candidate,fragment) pairs (Thomas Mu?ller, Thomas), (MarioGomez, Mario), (striker, striker) and (FC Bayern5We denote with deg(v) the overall number of incoming andoutgoing edges, i.e., deg(v) := deg+(v) + deg?

Our adapted strategy for selecting a densesubgraph of GI is based on the iterative removalof low-coherence vertices, i.e., fragment interpreta-tions.
We show the pseudocode in Algorithm 3.We start with the initial graph G(0)I at step t = 0(see line 5).
For each step t (lines 7?16), first, weidentify the most ambiguous fragment fmax, i.e., theone with the maximum number of candidate mean-236Algorithm 3 Densest Subgraph.1: input: F , the set of all fragments in the input text;cand, from fragments to candidate meanings;G(0)I , the full semantic interpretation graph;?, ambiguity level to be reached.2: output: G?I , a dense subgraph.3: function DENSSUB(F, cand,G(0)I , ?

Next, we discardthe weakest interpretation of the current fragmentfmax.
To do so, we determine the lexical and seman-tic coherence of each candidate meaning (v, fmax)using Formula 2 (see line 10).
We then removefrom our graph G(t)I the lowest-coherence vertex(vmin, fmax), i.e., the one whose score is minimum(see lines 11?13).
For instance, in Figure 1, fmaxis the fragment Mario and we have: score((MarioGomez, Mario)) ?
33 ?
5 = 5, score((Mario Basler,Mario)) ?
13 ?
1 = 0.3 and score((Mario Adorf,Mario))?
23 ?
2 = 1.3, so we remove (Mario Basler,Mario) from the graph since its score is minimum.We then move to the next step, i.e., we set t :=t + 1 (see line 16) and repeat the low-coherence re-moval step.
We stop when the number of remainingcandidates for each fragment is below a threshold?, i.e., |{v : ?

F (seelines 8?9).
During each iteration step t we com-pute the average degree of the current graph G(t)I ,i.e., avgdeg(G(t)I ) = 2|E(t)I ||V (t)I |.
Finally, we select asthe densest subgraph of the initial semantic interpre-tation graphGI the graphG?I that maximizes the av-erage degree (see lines 14?15).8 Experimental SetupDatasets.

GETALP (Schwab et al., 2013) which uses anAnt Colony Optimization technique togetherwith the classical measure of Lesk (1986).We also compared with UKB w2w (Agirreand Soroa, 2009), a state-of-the-art approach forknowledge-based WSD, based on PersonalizedPageRank (Haveliwala, 2002).
We used the samemapping from words to senses that we used in ourapproach, default parameters7 and BabelNet as theinput graph.
Moreover, we compared our systemwith IMS (Zhong and Ng, 2010), a state-of-the-art supervised English WSD system which uses anSVM trained on sense-annotated corpora, such asSemCor (Miller et al., 1993) and DSO (Ng andLee, 1996), among others.
We used the IMS modelout-of-the-box with Most Frequent Sense (MFS) asbackoff routine since the model obtained using thetask trial data performed worse.We followed the original task formulation andevaluated the synsets in three different settings, i.e.,7./ukb wsd -D dict.txt -K kb.bin --ppr w2w ctx.txtwhen using BabelNet senses, Wikipedia senses andWordNet senses, thanks to BabelNet being a super-set of the other two inventories.
We ran our sys-tem on a document-by-document basis, i.e., disam-biguating each document at once, so as to test itseffectiveness on long coherent texts.
Performancewas calculated in terms of F1 score.
We also com-pared the systems with the MFS baseline computedfor the three inventories (Navigli et al., 2013).Coarse-grained WSD.
For the SemEval-2007task 7 we compared our system with the two top-ranked approaches, i.e., NUS-PT (Chan et al., 2007)and UoR-SSI (Navigli, 2008), which respectivelyexploited parallel texts and enriched semantic pathsin a semantic network, the previously describedUKB w2w system,8 a knowledge-based WSD ap-proach (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010) which exploitsan automatic extension of WordNet, and, as base-line, the MFS.Fine-grained WSD.
For the remaining fine-grained WSD datasets, i.e., Senseval-3 andSemEval-2007 task 17, we compared our approachwith the previously described state-of-the-artsystems UKB and IMS, and, as baseline, the MFS.KORE50 and AIDA-CoNLL.
For the KORE50and AIDA-CoNLL datasets we compared our sys-tem with six approaches, including state-of-the-artones (Hoffart et al., 2012; Cornolti et al., 2013):?
MW, i.e., the Normalized Google Distance asdefined by Milne and Witten (2008);?
KPCS (Hoffart et al., 2012), which calcu-lates a Mutual Information weighted vector ofkeyphrases for each candidate and then uses thecosine similarity to obtain candidates?

KORE and its variants KORELSH?G andKORELSH?F (Hoffart et al., 2012), based onsimilarity measures that exploit the overlap be-tween phrases associated with the consideredentities (KORE) and a hashing technique to re-duce the space needed by the keyphrases asso-ciated with the entities (LSH-G, LSH-F);?

Note that we could not use supervised sys-tems, as the training data of AIDA-CoNLL coversless than half of the mentions used in the testingpart and less than 10% of the entities considered inKORE50.
To enable a fair comparison, we ran oursystem by restricting the BabelNet sense inventoryof the target mentions to the English Wikipedia.

We used the out-of-the-box RESTful API available at http://spotlight.dbpedia.org9 ResultsMultilingual WSD.
In Table 1 we show the F1performance on the SemEval-2013 task 12 for thethree setups: WordNet, Wikipedia and BabelNet.Using BabelNet we surpass all systems on Englishand German and obtain performance comparablewith the best systems on two other languages (UKBon Italian and UMCC-DLSI on Spanish).
Using theWordNet sense inventory, our results are on a parwith the best system, i.e., IMS.
On Wikipedia ourresults range between 71.6% (French) and 87.4% F1(English), i.e., more than 10 points higher than thecurrent state of the art (UMCC-DLSI) in all 5 lan-guages.
As for the MFS baseline, which is knownto be very competitive in WSD (Navigli, 2009), webeat it in all setups except for German on Wikipedia.Interestingly, we surpass the WordNet MFS by 2.9points, a significant result for a knowledge-basedsystem (see also (Pilehvar and Navigli, 2014)).Coarse- and fine-grained WSD.
In Table 2, weshow the results of the systems on the SemEval-2007 coarse-grained WSD dataset.
As can be seen,we obtain the second best result after Ponzetto andNavigli (2010).
In Table 1 (first two columns), weshow the results of IMS and UKB on the Senseval-3and SemEval-2007 task 17 datasets.
We rank secondon both datasets after IMS.
However, the differencesare not statistically significant.
Moreover, Agirre etal.
(2014, Table 5) note that using WordNet 3.0, in-stead of 1.7 or 2.1, to annotate these datasets cancause a more than one percent drop in performance.239System F1(Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010) 85.5Babelfy 84.6UoR-SSI 84.1UKB w2w 83.6NUS-PT ?82.3MFS 77.4Babelfy unif.

(?2,p < 0.05).Entity Linking.
In Table 3 we show the results onthe two Entity Linking datasets, i.e., KORE50 andAIDA-CoNLL.
Our system outperforms all otherapproaches, with KORE-LSH-G getting closest, andTagme and Wikifier lagging behind on the KORE50dataset.
For the AIDA-CoNLL dataset we obtain thethird best performance after MW and KPCS, how-ever the difference is not statistically significant.We note the low performance of DBpedia Spot-light which, even if it achieves almost 100% preci-sion on the identified mentions on both datasets, suf-fers from low recall due to its candidate identifica-tion step, confirming previous evaluations (Derczyn-ski et al., 2013; Hakimov et al., 2012; Ludwig andSack, 2011).
This problem becomes even more ac-centuated in the latest version of this system (Daiberet al., 2013).
Finally, UKB using BabelNet obtainslow performance on EL, i.e., 19.4-10.5 points belowthe state of the art.
This result is discussed below.Discussion.
The results obtained by UKB showthat the high performance of our unified approachto EL and WSD is not just a mere artifact of the useof a rich multilingual semantic network, that is, Ba-belNet.
In other words, it is not true that any graph-based algorithm could be applied to perform bothEL and WSD at the same time equally well.
Thisalso shows that BabelNet by itself is not sufficientfor achieving high performances for both tasks andthat, instead, an appropriate processing of the struc-tural and lexical information of the semantic net-work is needed.
A manual analysis revealed that themain cause of error for UKB in the EL setup stemsSystem KORE50 CoNLLBabelfy 71.5 82.1KORE-LSH-G 64.6 81.8KORE 63.9 ?80.7MW ?57.6 82.3Tagme 56.3 70.1KPCS 55.6 82.2KORE-LSH-F 53.2 81.2UKB w2w (on BabelNet) 52.1 71.8Illinois Wikifier 41.7 72.4DBpedia Spotlight 35.4 34.0Babelfy unif.

(?2, p < 0.05).from its inability to enforce high coherence, e.g., byjointly disambiguating all the words, which is in-stead needed when considering the high level of am-biguity that we have in our semantic interpretationgraph (Cucerzan, 2007).
For instance, for sentence(1) in the introduction, UKB disambiguates Thomasas a cricket player and Mario as the popular videogame rather than the two well-known soccer play-ers, and Munich as the German city, rather than thesoccer team in which they play.
Our approach, in-stead, by enforcing highly coherent semantic inter-pretations, correctly identifies all the soccer-relatedentities.In order to determine the need of our loose candi-date identification heuristic (see Section 6), we com-pared the percentage of times a candidate set con-tains the correct entity against that obtained by anexact string matching between the mention and thesense inventory.
On KORE50, our heuristic retrievesthe correct entity 98.6% of the time vs. 42.4% whenexact matching is used.
This demonstrates the inad-equacy of exact matching for EL, and the need fora comprehensive sense inventory, as is done in ourapproach.We also performed different ablation tests by ex-perimenting with the following variants of our sys-tem (reported at the bottom of Tables 1, 2 and 3):?
Babelfy using uniform distribution during theRWR to obtain the concepts?
semantic sig-natures; this test assesses the impact of ourweighting and edge creation strategy.240?
Babelfy without performing the densest sub-graph heuristic, i.e., when line 12 in Algorithm2 is G?I = GI , so as to verify the impact ofidentifying the most coherent interpretations.?
Babelfy applied to the BabelNet subgraph in-duced by the entire set of named entity ver-tices, for the EL task, and that induced by wordsenses only, for the WSD task; this test aims tostress the impact of our unified approach.?
Babelfy applied on sentences instead of onwhole documents.The component which has a smaller impact onthe performance is our triangle-based weightingscheme.
The main exception is on the smallestdataset, i.e., SemEval-2007 task 17, for which thisversion attains an improvement of 2.5 percentagepoints.Babelfy without the densest subgraph algorithmis the version which attains the lowest performanceson the EL task, with a 9% performance drop on theKORE50 dataset, showing the need for a speciallydesigned approach to cope with the high level of am-biguity that is encountered on this task.
On the otherhand, in the WSD datasets this version attains almostthe same results as the full version, due to the lowernumber of candidate word senses.Babelfy applied on sentences instead of on wholedocuments shows a lower performance, confirm-ing the significance of higher semantic coherenceon whole documents (notwithstanding the two ex-ceptions on the SemEval-2007 task 17 and on theSemEval-2013 German Wikipedia datasets).Finally, the version in which we restrict oursystem to named entities only (for EL) and con-cepts only (for WSD) consistently obtains lower re-sults (notwithstanding the three exceptions on theSpanish SemEval-2013 task 12 using BabelNet andWikipedia, and on the SemEval 2007 coarse-grainedtask).
This highlights the benefit of our joint useof lexicographic and encyclopedic structured knowl-edge, on each of the two tasks.
The 3.4% per-formance drop attained on KORE50 is of particu-lar interest, since this dataset aims at testing perfor-mance on highly ambiguous mentions within shortsentences.
This indicates that the semantic analysisof small contexts can be improved by leveraging thecoherence between concepts and named entities.10 ConclusionIn this paper we presented Babelfy, a novel,integrated approach to Entity Linking andWord Sense Disambiguation, available athttp://babelfy.org.
Our joint solution isbased on three key steps: i) the automatic creationof semantic signatures, i.e., related concepts andnamed entities, for each node in the referencesemantic network; ii) the unconstrained identifica-tion of candidate meanings for all possible textualfragments; iii) linking based on a high-coherencedensest subgraph algorithm.
We used BabelNet1.1.1 as our multilingual semantic network.Our graph-based approach exploits the semanticnetwork structure to its advantage: two key featuresof BabelNet, that is, its multilinguality and its in-tegration of lexicographic and encyclopedic knowl-edge, make it possible to run our general, unified ap-proach on the two tasks of Entity Linking and WSDin any of the languages covered by the semantic net-work.
However, we also demonstrated that Babel-Net in itself does not lead to state-of-the-art accu-racy on both tasks, even when used in conjunctionwith a high-performance graph-based algorithm likePersonalized PageRank.
This shows the need for ournovel unified approach to EL and WSD.At the core of our approach lies the effective treat-ment of the high degree of ambiguity of partial tex-tual mentions by means of a 2-approximation algo-rithm for the densest subgraph problem, which en-ables us to output a semantic interpretation of theinput text with drastically reduced ambiguity, as waspreviously done with SSI (Navigli, 2008).Our experiments on six gold-standard datasetsshow the state-of-the-art performance of our ap-proach, as well as its robustness across languages.Our evaluation also demonstrates that our approachfares well both on long texts, such as those of theWSD tasks, and short and highly-ambiguous sen-tences, such as the ones in KORE50.
Finally, abla-tion tests and further analysis demonstrate that eachcomponent of our system is needed to contributestate-of-the-art performances on both EL and WSD.As future work, we plan to use Babelfy for in-formation extraction, where semantics is taking thelead (Moro and Navigli, 2013), and for the valida-tion of semantic annotations (Vannella et al., 2014).241AcknowledgmentsThe authors gratefully acknowl-edge the support of the ERC Start-ing Grant MultiJEDI No.
