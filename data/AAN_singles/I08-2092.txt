Although some English dictio-naries have their own defining vocabulary,no Japanese dictionary has such vocabu-lary as of yet.
As the first step towardbuilding a Japanese defining vocabulary, weranked Japanese words based on a graph-based method.
In this paper, we introducethe method, and show some evaluation re-sults of applying the method to an existingJapanese dictionary.1 IntroductionDefining all words in a dictionary by using a lim-ited number of words (defining vocabulary) is help-ful in language learning.
For example, it wouldmake it easy for children and second-language learn-ers to understand definitions of all words in the dic-tionary if they understand all words in the definingvocabulary.
In some English dictionaries such asthe Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English(LDOCE) (Proctor, 2005) and the Oxford AdvancedLearner?s Dictionary (OALD) (Hornby and Ashby,2005), 2,000-3,000 words are chosen and all head-words are defined by using the vocabulary.
Such dic-tionaries are widely used for language learning.Currently, however, such a dictionary in whicha defining vocabulary is specified has not beenavailable in Japanese.
Although many studies forJapanese ?basic vocabulary?
have been done (Na-tional Institute for Japanese Language, 2000), ?ba-sic vocabulary?
in the studies means a vocabularywhich children or second-language learners have (orshould learn).
In other words, the aim of such stud-ies is to determine a set of headwords which shouldbe included in a Japanese dictionary for children orsecond-language learners.We think that there is a difference between ?defin-ing vocabulary?
and ?basic vocabulary?.
Althoughbasic vocabulary is usually intended for learning ex-pression in newspaper/magazine articles, daily con-versation, school textbook, etc, a defining vocabu-lary is intended for describing word definition in adictionary.
Some words (or phrases) which are of-ten used in word definition, such as ?...
??
(ab-breviation of ...)?, ????
(change/shift)?
1, ???(thing/matter)?
etc, are not included in some kindsof basic vocabulary.
Additionally only one word in aset of synonyms should be included in a defining vo-cabulary even if all of them are well-known.
For ex-ample, if a word ???
(use)?
is included in a defin-ing vocabulary, synonyms of the word, such as ?????
?, ??????
and ????
?, are not needed.A goal of this study is to try to build a Japanesedefining vocabulary on the basis of distributionof words used in word definition in an existingJapanese dictionary.
In this paper, as the first step ofthis, we introduce the method for ranking Japanesewords, and show some evaluation results of applyingthe method to an existing Japanese dictionary.
Also,we compare the results with two kinds of basic vo-1It is a kind of conjunction used to describe a new meaningcomes out of the original meaning.679Word definitionHeadword??

(Kasahara et al, 2004).
Thelexicon contains the most familiar 28,000 Japanesewords, which are determined through question-naires.
All words in the lexicon are defined by using16,900 words in the same lexicon.
However, the sizeof the vocabulary seems to be too large compared tothe size of the defining vocabularies used in LDOCEand OALD.
We also think that whether a word is fa-miliar or not does not always correspond to whetherthe word is necessary for word definition or not.Gelbukh et al proposed a method for detectingcycles in word definitions and selecting primitivewords (Gelbukh and Sidorov, 2002).
This methodis intended for converting an existing ?human-oriented?
dictionary into a ?computer-oriented?
dic-tionary, and the primitive words are supposed not tobe defined in the dictionary.Fukuda et al adopted an LSA-based (latent se-mantic analysis) method to build a defining vocab-ulary (Fukuda et al, 2006).
The method would beanother solution to this issue although only a smallevaluation experiment was carried out.3 MethodOur method for building a Japanese defining vocab-ulary is as follows:1.
For each headword in an existing Japanese dic-tionary, represent the relationship between theheadword and each word in the word definitionas a directed graph (word reference graph).2.
Compute the score for each word based on theword reference graph.3.
Nominate the high ranked words for theJapanese defining vocabulary.4.
Manually check whether each nominated wordis appropriate as defining vocabulary or not,and remove the word if it is not appropriate.In the rest of this section, we introduce our methodfor constructing word reference graph and comput-ing score for each word.3.1 Word Reference GraphA word reference graph is a directed graph repre-senting relation between words.
For each headwordin a dictionary, it is connected to each word in theword definition by a directed edge (Figure 1).
Nodesin the graph are identified by reading, base form(orthography), and parts-of-speech because somewords have more than one part-of-speech or reading(???
(the reading is ?amari?)?
has two parts-of-speech, noun and adverb, and ????
has two read-ings, ?shousetsu?
and ?kobushi?).
Postpositions,auxiliary verbs, numbers, proper names, and sym-bols are removed from the graph.3.2 Computing The Score for Each WordThe score of each word is computed under the as-sumption that1.
A score of a word which appears in many worddefinitions will be high.2.
A score of a word which appears in the defini-tion of a word with high score will also be high.680If a word is included in a defining vocabulary, wordsin the word definition may need to be included inorder to define the word.
The second assumptionreflects the intuition.
We adopt the algorithm ofPageRank (Page et al, 1998) or LexRank (Erkan andRadev, 2004), which computes the left eigenvectorof the adjacency matrix of the word reference graphwith the corresponding eigenvalue of 1.4 Evaluation4.1 Experimental SetupWe used the Iwanami Japanese dictionary corpus(Hasida, 2006).
The corpus was built by annotatingthe Iwanami Japanese dictionary (the 5th edition)with the GDA tags (Hasida, 2004) and some othertags specific to the corpus.
Although it has manykinds of tags, we focus on information about theheadword (hd), orthography (orth), part-of-speech(pos), sentence unit in word definition (su), and mor-pheme (n, v, ad, etc.).
We ignore kind of addi-tional information, such as examples (eg), grammat-ical explanations (gram), antonyms (ant), etymology(etym), references to other entries (sr), etc, sincesuch information is not exactly ?word definition?.Words in parentheses, ????
and ???
?, are alsoignored since they are used to quote some words orexpressions for explanation and should be excludedfrom consideration of defining vocabulary.Some problems arose when constructing a wordreference graph.1.
Multiple ways of writing in kanji:For example, in the Iwanami Japanese dictio-nary, ???
?, ???
?, ???
?, ???
?, ????,????
and ????
appear in an entry of averb ?hiku?
as its orthography.
If more thanone writing way appear in one entry, they aremerged into one node in the word referencegraph (they are separated if they have differentpart-of-speech).2.
Part-of-speech conversion:While each word in word definition was an-notated with part-of-speech by corpus annota-tors, part-of-speech of each headword in thedictionary was determined by dictionary edi-tors.
The two part-of-speech systems are differ-ent from each other.
In order to resolve the dif-ference, we prepared a coarse-grained part-of-speech system (just classifying into noun, verb,adjectives, etc.
), and converted part-of-speechof each word.3.
Word segmentation:In Japanese, words are not segmented by spacesand the word segmentation policy for corpusannotation sometimes disagree with the pol-icy for headword registration of the JapaneseIwanami dictionary.
In the case that two con-secutive nouns or verbs are in word definitionand a word consisting of the two words is in-cluded as a headword in the dictionary, the twowords are merged into one word.4.
Difference in writing way between a head-word and a word in word definition:In Japanese language, we have three kindof characters, kanji, hiragana, and katakana.Most of the headwords appearing in a dictio-nary (except loanwords) are written in kanji asorthography.
On the other hand, for example,??
(matter)?
is usually written in hiragana (????)
in word definition.
However, it is diffi-cult to know automatically that a word ???
?in word definition means ??
?, since the dictio-nary has other entries which has the same read-ing ?koto?, such as ??
(Japanese harp)?
and ???
(ancient city)?.
We merged two nodes inthe word reference graph manually if the twowords are the same and only different in thewriting way.As a result, we constructed a word reference graphconsisting of 69,013 nodes.We adopted the same method as (Erkan andRadev, 2004) for computing the eigenvector of theadjacency matrix (score of each word).
Dampingfactor for random walk and error tolerance are set to0.15 and 10?4 respectively.4.2 ResultTable 1 shows the top-50 words ranked by ourmethod.
Scores are normalized so that the score ofthe top word is 1.681Table 1: The top-50 wordsScore Reading Orthography POS Meaning1 1.000 aru ?

(meaning)?, ???
(thing/matter)?, ??
(change/shift)?.On the other hand, some words in the top rankedwords, such as ?A?
and ?B?, seem not to be appro-priate for defining vocabulary.
These words appearonly in word definition and are not included in theIwanami Japanese dictionary as headwords (i.e.
un-registered words) 3.
The score of an unregisteredword tends to be higher than it should be, since thenode corresponding to the word has no edge to othernodes in the word reference graph.Figure 2 shows word coverage, i.e.
percentageof words appearing in word definition which wereranked in the top-n. From the result (solid line),we can find that the increase in coverage aroundn = 10, 000 is low and the coverage increases sud-denly from n = 15, 000.
This is because all un-registered words were ranked in the top-15000.
Ifall unregistered words are removed, the increase incoverage gets gradually lower as n increases (dottedline).In construction of a word reference graph, 9,327words were judged as unregistered words.
The rea-son is as follows:1.
Part-of-speech mismatch:In order to solve the difference between thepart-of-speech system for annotation of head-words and the system for annotation of wordsin the definition of each headword, we pre-3In some word definitions, roman letters are used as vari-ables.682pared a coarse-grained part-of-speech systemand converted part-of-speech of each word.However, the conversion failed in some cases.For example, some words are annotated withsuffix or prefix in word definition, while theyare registered as noun in the dictionary.2.
Mismatch of word segmentation:Two consecutive nouns or verbs in word def-inition were merged into one word if a wordconsisting of the two words is included asa headword in the Iwanami Japanese dictio-nary.
However, in the case that a compoundword is treated as one word in word defini-tion and the word is not registered as a head-word in Iwanami Japanese dictionary, the wordis judged as an unregistered word.3.
Error in format or annotation of the corpus:Since the Iwanami Japanese dictionary corpushas some errors in format or annotation, weremoved entries which have such errors be-fore construction of the word reference graph.Headwords which were removed for this reasonare judged as unregistered words.4.
Real unregistered words:Some words in word definition are not regis-tered as headwords actually.
For example, al-though a noun ???
(English language)?
ap-pears in word definition, the word is not regis-tered as a headword.Unregistered words should carefully be checkedwhether they are appropriate as defining vocabularyor not at the third step of our method described insection 3.4.3 ComparisonIn order to look at the difference between the resultand so-called ?basic vocabulary?, we compared theresult with two types of basic vocabulary: one wasbuilt by the National Institute for Japanese Language(including 6,099 words) and the other was built bythe Chuo Institute for Educational Research (includ-ing 4,332 words) (National Institute for JapaneseLanguage, 2001).
These two types of vocabulary areintended for foreigners (second-language learners)01020304050607080901000 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 60000 70000Recall (%)The top-n wordsAll words (NIJL)All words (CIER)Only headwords (NIJL)Only headwords (CIER)Figure 3: Comparison with two types of basic vo-cabularyTable 2: High-ranked words out of the two basic vo-cabulariesRank Reading Orthography POS Meaning51 tenjiru ???

As in the case of word coverage, the in-crease in recall around n = 10, 000 is low if unreg-istered words are not removed (solid lines).
If thesame number of headwords as the size of each basicvocabulary are picked up from our result, it can befound that about 50% of the words are shared witheach basic vocabulary (dotted lines).Some of the high-ranked words out of the two ba-sic vocabularies and some of the low-ranked wordsin the vocabularies are listed in Table 2 and 3.
Al-though it would be natural that the words listed inTable 2 are not included in the basic vocabular-ies, they are necessary for describing word defini-tion.
On the other hand, the words listed in Table 3may not be necessary for describing word definition,while they are often used in daily life.683Table 3: Low-ranked words in the two basic vocab-ulariesRank Reading Orthography POS Meaning20062 taifuu ??

Conj but/however5 ConclusionIn this paper, we introduced the method for rankingJapanese words in order to build a Japanese definingvocabulary.
We do not think that a set of the top-n words ranked by our method could be a definingvocabulary as is.
The high ranked words need tobe checked whether they are appropriate as definingvocabulary or not.As described in section 1, defining all words witha defining vocabulary is helpful in language learn-ing.
In addition, we expect that the style of writingword definitions (e.g.
which word should be used,whether the word should be written in kanji or hira-gana, etc.)
can be controlled with the vocabulary.This kind of vocabulary could also be useful forNLP researches as well as language learning.
Ac-tually, defining vocabularies used in LDOCE andOALD are often used in some NLP researches.The future work is the following:?
The size of a defining vocabulary needs to bedetermined.
Although all words in LDOCE orOALD are defined by 2,000-3,000 words, thesize of a Japanese defining vocabulary may belarger than English ones.?
Wierzbicka presented the notion of conceptualprimitives (Wierzbicka, 1996).
We need to lookinto our result from a linguistic point of view,and to discuss the relation.?
It is necessary to consider how to describe worddefinition as well as which word should be usedfor word definition.
Definition of each word ina dictionary includes many kinds of informa-tion, not only the word sense but also historicalbackground, grammatical issue, etc.
Only wordsense should be described with a defining vo-cabulary, since the other information is a littledifferent from word sense and it may be diffi-cult to describe the information with the samevocabulary.ReferencesGu?nes?
