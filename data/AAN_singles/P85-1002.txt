These rules are used for inter-preting the text, Ln particular, embiguities,as well as for generating the final output~f the NLFS.3This partial parse of the sentence followsJackendoff's X-bar theory \[Jackendoff 77},which ts discussed in \[Obe rmeier 84, 851; romannumerals indicate the number of bars assignedto each phrase, Comments to the parse weremade after the actual run of the program.10If a doctor were given a patient's casehistory (see Figure l), he would read the textand try to extract the salient pieces of infor-mation which are necessary for his diagnosis.In this particular text type, he would be in-terested in the sign, symptoms, and laboratorydata, as well as the medical history of thepatient.
The crucial point hereby is thetemporal information associated with theoccurrences of these data.
In general, hewould try to cluster certain abnormalmanifestations to form hypotheses which wouldresult in a coherent diagnosis.
The clusteringwould be based on the temporal succession ofthe information in the text.
Each manifestationof abnormalities \[ will refer to as an "event".Each event is defined and related to otherevents by means of temporal informationexplicitly or implicitly provided in the text.An important notion which \[ use in my programis chat of a key event 4.
"Events are or~anize~around key events  (which are domain-specificin the medical domain, some of the importantones are 'admission', 'surgery', 'accident',etc.
), so that ocher events are typically statedor ordered with respect to these key events"\[Micra\[ 82\].3.0  KNi~IrLF.DCE-BASED PARSING3.1 Se lec t ion  and OwganizaCion for  the KnowledgeBase\[ have characterized the task of a doctorreading a patient's case history as findingkey domain concepts (e.g., sign, symptom,laboratory data), relating them to temporalindicators (e.g, seven veers a~o), and orderingthe events resulting from assignin R temporalindicators co key concepts with respect toa "key event" (e.g., at admission, at surgery).

Certain symptomshave to be further defined: swellin~ needsa characterization as to where it occurs.
Paincan be characterized by its location, intensity.and nature (e.g., "shooting").Signs: abnormalities found by the phys ic iansuch as fever, jaundice, or swelling.4The notion of "key event" is furtherdiscussed in 4.3 "Key Events".Whether "fever" is a sign or a symptomis indicated by the verb.
Therefore, the verbshave features which indicate if the followingis a sign or a symptom.

The"key event" at admission is mentioned explicit lyand must be recognized as a concept by thesystem.After selecting the facts on the basisof about 35 case descriptions as well as previousresearch of the medical sublanguage \[Hirschman83\] 5 , \[ organized them into schemas based onwhat is known" about the particular text type.\[n \]Bonnet 79\], a medical summary ischaracterized as "a sequence of episodes thatcorrespond Co phrases, sentences, or groupsof sentences dealing with a single topic.
Theseconstitute the model and are represented bvschemas" \[Bonnet 79, 80\].
Schemas for themedical domain in Bonnet's system are $PATIENT-iNFORMATION (e .g .
,  sex,  job) ,  SSICNS (e .g .
,\ [ever ,  jaund ice) .
\[n GROK, l use the schemasSREPORT-SICN, SREPORT-SYMPTOM, SREPORT-LAB-DATA,SPATIENT-\[NFO.
Each of  my schemas ind icates"who reports, what co whom, and when".
The$REPORT-SYMPTOM schema has the following ele-ments: verb(unknown), subject(patient), object-(symptom), indirect object(medic), time(defaultis admission).After selecting the facts on the basisof the domain, and organizing them on the basisof the text-type, \[ add one fact for puttingthe information into the target representation.The target representation consists of a temporalindicator attached to a domain-specific factwhat \[ had referred to in as "event".
Theevent structure contains the following elements:name of domain-specific concept, referencepoint, duration (known or unknown), and relationto reference point (e.g., before, after).51 use ten types  o f  domain -spec i f i c  fac ts :s ign ,  symptom, lab data ,  body-par t ,  e tc .
,  Iuse s ix  tempora l  fac ts :  month, year ,  day,  week,duration, period, i.e., "for how long".113.2 The F low o f  Cont ro lIn addition to domain-specif ic knowledge,a person reading a text also uses his linguisticknowledge of the English grammar.
The problemfor a NLPS is how to integrate linguistic andextra linguistic knowledge.
The dominantparadigm in computational linguistics usessyntactic and morphological information beforeconsidering extra linguistic knowledge; i fextra linguistic knowledge is used at all.Considering syntactic knowledge beforeany other type of knowledge has the followingproblems which are avoided if enough contextualinformation can be detected by the knowledgebase of the NIPS:?
global ambiguities cannot beresolved (e.g., Visitin~relatives can be bortn~)?
word-class ambiguities (e.g.,bank) and structural ambiguitiescause mult ip le  parses (e.g.
,\[ saw the man on the hill withthe  telescope).Moreover, psycholinguistic experimentshave shown \[Marslen-Wilson 75, Marslen-Wilson78, Marsten-Wilson 801 that the syntactic.,nalvsis of a sentence does not precede higherlevel processing bu~ interacts with seman=icand pragmatic information.
These findingsare, to some extent, controversial, and notaccepted  by a l l  psvcho l inRu is ts .In  my sys tem,  knowledge about  the  domain ,the  text - type ,  and the  ta rRet  representat ionis used before and together with syntacticinformation.
The syntactic information helpsto select the interpretation of the sentence.Syntax functions as a filter for processinginformation.
\[t selects the constituents ofa sentence, and groups them into larger "chunks",called phrases.
The phrase types noun phrases\[NP\] and verb phrase \ [VP I  contain proceduresto form concepts (e.g.
,  "abdominal pain").
Theseconcepts are combined by function special ists.Function specialists consists of proceduresattached to function words (e.~., prepositions,determiners), fnflectional morphemes, andboundary markers (e .g .
,  comma, period).Technically, \[ distinguish between phrase~pecialists and function specialists.
Thephrase  ~pecialists interact with extra\[tnguisticknowledge to determine which concepts are ey-pressed in a text, the function specialistsde~ermine locally what relation these conceptshave to each other.
So in general, the phrasespecialists are activated before the functionspecialists.To illustrate this process, consider thesentence:(3) The patient complained of shoottn~ painacross the flanks for three days beforeadmission.The NP-specialist combines the and patientinto a phrase.
The central processing componentin the sentence ls the VP-specialist.
Itstask is to find the verb-particle construction(complain of), and the object (e.g., shootin~pain).
The VP-specialist also looks at thesyntactic and semantic characteristics ofcomplain o__f_f.
It notes that complain o f  expectsa symptom in its object position.
Theexpectation of a symptom invokes the schema"report-symptom".
At this point, the schemacould fill in missing information, e.~.
,  ifno subject had been mentioned, it could indicatethat the patient is the subject.
The schemaidentifies the current topic of the sentence,vlz., "symptom".CROK next encounters the word shootin~.This word has no further specif ication besidesthat of bein~ used as an adjective.
The headnoun pain points to a more complex entity "pain"which expects further specif ications (e .~.
,location, type).
It first tries to find anyfurther specifications within the :malvzedpart of the NP.
\[t finds shootin~ and addsthis characteristic to the entity "pain".
Since"pain" is usually specified in terms of i t slocation, a place adverbial is expected.
Uponthe eqtry of across, the entity "pain" includes"acro~s" as a local ion marker, expect in~ asthe  next word a body-part.
The next word,flank is a body-part, and the "pain" entityis  completed.
Note here ,  that the attachmentof the preposition was ~uided by the informationcontained in the knowledge base.The next word for is a function word whichcan indicate duration.
To determine whichadverbial for Lntroduces, the system has towait for the information from the followingNl'-specialist.
After the numeric value "three",the temporal indicator "dav" identifies fo ras a duration marker.Exp l i c i t  ~empora l  ind icators  such as day ,week,  o r  month ,  under  cer ta in  cond i t ions  in -t roduce  new events.
As soon as GROK veri-fies that a temporal indicator started an event,it fills in the information from the "report-:<xx" ,~chema.
The new event representationi nc ludes  the  s ign ,  symptom, or  laboratory  data ,and the temporal indicator.
The last two wordsin the sample sentence before adm?ssion, pro-vide Khe missing information as to what "keyevent" the ~ewly created event \[s related to.Once a new event frame or domain-specificframe is instnntiated) GROK can use the in for -mation associated with each event frame (e.g.
)duration, key-event), together with the in for -mation from the domain-specific f rame (e.g.
,the pain frame contains slots for specifyingthe location, intensity, and type of pain) tointerpret the text.124.0  TEMPORAL \[NFO\[~ATION PROCESSINC4.1 Prob lemsThe inherent problems of text comprehensionfrom an information processing viewpoint arehow to deal with the foremost problems incomputational NLP (e.g., ambiguity, anaphora,ellipsis, conjunction), including the foremostproblems in temporal information processing(e.g., implicit time reference, imprecisionof reference).Within A\[ and computational linguistics,only a few theories have been proposed forthe processing of temporal information \[Kahn77, Hirschman 8\[, Kamp 7g, Allen 83l.
in parti-cular, a theory of how a NLP can comprehendtemporal relations in a written text is  stillmissing.
\[n my research, \[ present a theoryfor processing temporal information in a NLPSfor a well-defined class of technical descrip-tive texts.
The texts dea l  with a specificdomain and tasks which require the processingof linguistic information into a chronologicalorder of events.
The problems for processingthe temporal information contained in the textinclude:?
a NLPS has to work with impli-cit temporal information.ALthough in ( I ) ,  no explicittemporal re ference  is  p resent ,the NLPS has to detect theimplied information from thecontext and the extra Linguis-tic knowledge available.?
a NLPS has to work with fuzzyinformation.
The referencetO fo r  many years  in (} )  isfuzzy, and yet a NiPS has torelate it to the chrono logyof the case.?
a NLPS has to order the eventsin their chronology althoughthey are not temporally orderedin the text.4.2 So lut ionsHv solution to the problems discussedin the previous section lies within thecomputat iona l  parad igm as opposed co theChomskyan generative paradi~m.
The comFutationaLparadigm focuses nn how the comprehension pro-cesses are organized whereas within the gener-ative parad iRm,  l ingu is t i c  per fo rmance  is  ofless importance for a Linguistic theory thanLinguistic competence.
Within the computationalparadigm, the representation and use of extra-Linguistic knowledge is a maior part of studyingLinguistic phenomena, whereas generative lin-guists separate  linguistic phenomena whichfa l l  w i th in  the  rea lm o f  syntax  f rom othercogn i t ive  aspects  \[W~nograd 83 ,  21 \ ] .Functionality is the central theoreticalconcept upon which the design of GROK rests.What is important for comprehending languageis the function of an utterance in a givensituation.
Words are used for their meaning,and the meaning depends on the use in a givencontext.
The meaning of a word is subjectto change according to the context, which isbased on the function of the words that makeup the text.
Therefore, my approach to buildinga NLPS focuses on modeling the context of atext in a particular domain.
\[ am primarilyconcerned with the relationship between writer-text-reader, rather than with the relationshipbetween two sentences.
The use of the contextfor parsing requLres a knowledge representationof the domain, and the type of text, in additionto linguistic and empirical knowledge.In contradistinction to NLPSs which usesyntactic information first \[Thompson 8\[\],and which possibly generate unnecessarystructural descriptions, mv system uses higher\ [eve \ [  in fo rmat ion  (e .~.
,  domain ,  text - type)before and together with usuaLLv a smalleramount o\[ syntactic information, in GROK,the syntactic information selects betweencontextually interpretations o\[ the text~untax  acts  as  ~ i l l=or  for the N\[.IJS.in contradistinction to NLPSs which useconceptual information first \[Schank 75\], GROK,partially due to the limited information pro-cessin?
task and the particular domain, startsout with a small knowledge base and buildsup datastructures which are used subsequentlyin the processing of the text.
The knowledgebase of my system contains only the informationit absolutely needs, whereas Schankian scriptshave problems with when to activate scriptsand when to exit them.4.3 Key EventsTempora l  in fo rmat ion  in a text  is  conveyedby exp l i c i t  tempora l  ind icators ,  imp l i c i ttemporal relations based on what one knowsabout written texts (e.g., "time moves forward"),and "key events".
\[ define a key event asa domain-specif ic concept which is used roorder  and group events  a round a par t i cu la rkey event .
\[n my theorv ,  tempora l  p rocess ingis based on the identification of key eventsfar a parti=uLar domain, and their subsequentreco~uition bv the NLPS in the text.Tempora l  ind icators  .

The tense  mark in?on the  verb  has been the  Least  in f luent ia l{'or f i l l i ng  in the  event  s t ructure .
For  theprogram,  the  most impor tant  sources  areadverb ia l s .The l inear  sequence o f  sentences  alsocont r ibutes  co the  seE-up  o f  the  conf igurat ionso f  events .
My program makes use o f  two genera l lyknown heur i s t i cs ;  t ime moves fo rward  in  anar ra t ive  i f  not  exp l i c i t l y  s ta ted  o therwise ;J13the temporal  reference of the subordinate c lauseis o rd inar i ly  the same as that in the mainclause.
"Key events"  are s igni f icant  since theyare used to relate events to one another.
\[nmy theory of text processing,  key events bui ldup the temporal  s t ructure of a text.
\[f keyevents for other  domains can be identi f ied,they could be used to expla in  how a NLPS can"comprehend"  the texts of the domain in question.The representat ion  of temporal  in format ionis s igni f icant  \[n my theory.
\[ def ine an eventas the result of the ass ignment  of a temporalvalue to a domain-spec i f i c  concept.
Thestructure of an event is Renera l i zab le  to otherdomains.
An event consists  of a domain-spec i f i cconcept,  a key event, a re lat ion to ke~ event,and a durat ion.
\[n the medica l  domain, theinstant iated event conta ins  informat ion abouthow long, and when a symptom or sign occurred,and what the kev event of the instant iatedevent  was., \par t  from the  tempora l  i ssue ,  my researchhas shown that \[f the domain and the task ofthe NLPS are suf f ic ient ly  constra ined,  theuse of frames as a knowledge representat ion~cheme is ef f ic ient  in implement ing CROK.
in,nv program, \[ f lare used individual  frames torepresent single concepts  (e.g., pain).
Theseconcepts  help the NLPS to access thedomain -spec i f i c  knowledge base.
To?ether  withthe temporal  indicators,  the information fromtne knowledge base is then t ransferred to thetopmost event frame.
Procedures are then usedto relate var ious event frames to each other.The restr ic t ions  and checks on the instant iat ionof the individual  frames preclude an erroneotlsact ivat ion of a frame.The v iab i l i ty  of this approach shows thatthe idea of s tereotyp ica l  representdL\ [on ofinformation is useful  for NLPS \[f proper lyconstra ined.
Mv program checks for the access-abi l i ty  of the var ious levels of the knowledgerepresentat ion whenever  new information iscoming in.
This mul t i laver  approach constra insthe ~nstant iat ton of the event frame suff i -c ient ly  in  o rder  to prevent erroneous eventtnstant iat ion.4.4 Compar ison  to  Extant  Theor ies  on Tempora lP rocess inRThe overal l  ideas of GROK .is they re\[are~,r d i f fer  from ~he extant theories and svstemsare introduced by looking at four major  issuesconcern ing  temporal proces:~ing.?

problems: how is imprecis ion,fuzziness, and incompletenessof data handled??
test ing: how can the systembe tested; by queries,  proofs,etc.?
Does it have a cons is tencychecker?In GROK, \[ use an interva l -based approachto temporal  informat ion processing.
An eventis def ined as an ent i ty  of f inite durat ion.As in IKamp 79, 3771, event st ructures  aret ransformed into instants by the Russe l l -Wienerconstruct ion.\[n GROK, the NLPS processes temporal(nformat\[on by first assoc ia t ing  a conceptwith a temporal  reference, then eva luat ingthe extens ion  of this event.
The eva luat ioncons iders  syntact ic  (e.~., adverb ia ls )  andpragmat ic  information (current time focus).Each event is represented in the knowledgebase with information about when, for how long,and what occurred.The parser whi le ana lyz ing  the sentences,orders these events accord ing to a "key event".The single events contain information aboutthe tempora l  indicator which is at tached toa domain -soec~f ic  fact.
The single eventsare connected to the respect ive "key event".
"Key events"  are domain-spec i f i c .

GROK d i f fe rs14from Hirschman's system in that GROK usesdomain-specif ic and other extra linguisticinformation for analyzing the text, whereasHirschman relies primarily on available syntacticinformation.
Therefore, Hirschman's systemas presented in \[Hirschman 81\] can neitherhandle anaphoric references to continuous s ta tesnor represent imprecision in time specification.4.5  State of  \[=q~tememtatiouGROK is a h igh ly  exploratory program.The limitations of the current implementationare in three areas:?
The parser itself does notprovide the  capabil ity of achart parser since it willnot give differentinterpretations of a structurallyambiguous sentences.
Thistype of structural ambiguity,where one constituent can belongto two or more differentconstructions, would not bedetected.?
The knowledge base does nothave a fully implemented framestructure.
Each ~eneric framehas a certain number of slotsthat define the concept.
Ageneric concept  (e.g., sign)must have slots which containpossible attributes of thespecific frame (e .g .
,  whereis  the  s ign  found;  how severeis i t s  manifestation).
Theseslots have not yet beenimp lemented .
The number o fframes is strictly i /m i redto the temporal f rames anda few exemplary ~eneric framesnecessary to process the text.?
The range of phenomena isl im i ted .
Only "before-admission"references are recogn ized  bythe system.

A pragmat ic  theory  focuses  onthe in fo rmat ion  from the context  (e .g .
,  co - text ,discourse situation, intentions of interlocutors)to  exp la in  linguistic behavior.I have shown how an integration oflinguistic and extra linguistic knowledgeachieves a form of comprehension, wherecomprehension i s  characterized as a conversionof information based on knowledge from onrepresentation into another.
\[ have also shownhow this approach leads to a parsing techniquewhich avoids corm~on pitfalls, and, at the sametime, is consistent with results inpsycholinguistic research.
\[ have further-more shown that such a procedural approachis a basis for an event-based theory for temporalinformation processing.In particular, the findings implementedin GROK show the shortcomings of the orthodoxrule-based approach to language processingwhich reduces words to tokens in a larger contextwhile overemphasizing the role of the phraseand sentence level.
It does this by providinga temporal knowledge representation andalgorithms for processing pragmatic informationwhich are applicable to a wider range ofphenomena than most of the notable computationalNL theories within the field of A\[ Schank8\[, R/eger 79, Wi lks  75I, or  linguistics Marcus801.\[n particular, my research shows that?
NL can be processed  realisticallyby a deterministic algorithmwhich can be interpreted ina mental model.
A realisticNLPS tries to emulate humanbehavior.
A deterministicparser works under the assumptionthat ( \ [ )  a human NLPS makesi r revocab le  decisions duringprocessing and (2) that humansare  not unconstrained"wait-and-see-parsers" {Kac821.
A mental model providesan i n te rna l  representat ionof the state of affairs thatare described in a given sentence\[ J ohnson-La  i rd  8 \ [ I .?
