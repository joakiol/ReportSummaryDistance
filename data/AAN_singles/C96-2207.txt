conce.l)t el(:oh(,renc(~ in knowledge rel)res(mtation for naturallanguage discourses and to pose tim first founda-tions tk)r formal rel)re.sentation and autotrmtic pro.cessiug of coherence.We must emphasiz(: tirst that coherence in natmral language disc()urses may result from incoherentparts : a t)arL o\[ 'a discern:st may 1)c contradictorywith what is said in other parts without questiou--ing the coh(.
'rencc of the whoh~.
For examI)le, a (li--gression, a sut)p(/sition, an invalid hypothesis maybe inehlded as a part of a dis(;om:se and ruled outl)y what folh)ws.
So, a "lapse of memory" el)cr-ates often in text coml)rehension arid \[)rotecl,s thetext \['rein dee\]) incoherence.
This means, of course,that coherence in natural language discourses isquite diffecent from tim consistency in a mat|w,-matit:al theory, which has Lo be consistent in eacho\[' its sets of i)rol)ositions.
So, a cohcr(mce theoryfor natural  language representation systenls musttake into account this fact and limit the c()herencevcril ication to parts of texts actually asserted.At a de('q) level at least, we pose the hypothe-sis that a text is generally coherent.
So the llrob-\]era we address to is to try to detect incoher-ence.
Though the incoherence of a text may resultfrom a lot of phenomena, we restri(-t ourselves inthis communicat ion to incoherence stemming fromnegal, ions.
But surface negations must lie inter.l)r(d;ed in the t\]'amework of linguistics theory : thisis the Iirst l)art of our work (not included here duo.to lack of space.).
This study shows that negationis very sehlom at the origin of incoherct,:c. Thelast paN; of the communicat ion is (levot(~d to thetaldng into acc.ount of negatioll in a st)celtic cas(:of knowledge in our of l?tJowl('.

Tim framework of the rllo(h'.lis linguistic pragmatics : wc want to represent helinguistic marks of 1)ragmaties (and not the prag-matics of ail al)l)lieation ).
Thus, the knowledge as-sociated to a discourse is represented at two levels:a knowledge representation of the npplication do--main (which is outside Lira llaturaI languag(!
systom) and the model we are concerned wit\]l here,and which is the (h'.c:t)('.st level of our natured lan-guage analysis (the pragmatic level).
These con-strainLs cxt)lain wily the existing knowledge rel)re-.Selltal;ioll systeHts al'e tlO\[, COllVel'li,eiII; \['()r ollr putpose : the information is sl)ecific and, at)eve all,the reasonings to l)er\['(/rni are t/rOl)('r (,o naturallanguage discom:ses.
'l'he prototype ()\[ these rea--sonings is the at)du(-tiv(: one, in which, from aproperty asserted in the text we infer an object,which t)ossesses this property ~m(\[, then, we con-sider all the characteristics of tile selected objectas valid for I;he text.2.2 Outl ine of the  re i ) resentat ion  mo(h~lThe knowledge rcpres(;ntation rno(h'.\] is an object()\[IC, expross(.~d ill a particular logic forntalisrn.The underlying logic is that of M'\]SNII ';WSKI'slogical systems \[Lesniowski, \] 989\], \[Midvi Ih;, 1984\],\[ILouault, \[991\].
In those systems, the primitivt'sof an oh jet.l, model correspond to the "is-a" of l;\]w(3aleulus of Names and t;he ingredient \['unctor o1"the.
Mereology \[Achou/)a nd Rouault, 198!)\].
Wehave th us a h)gic;d basis for the primitives of mostobject models and a framework for the.
inductivepart of the system.1139'l'he individuals of the knowledge base are ob-jects.
This base is divided into worlds.
A worldis a structured set of objects which is coherent :the exceptions, change of meanings are taken intoaccount by a change of world.
A world is dividedinto two universes : its intension and its exten-sion.
The intension contains those objects whoserepresentation is supposed valid for speakers andsituations related to discourse nunciation aitd tothe application dolnain : there exists a consen-sus between the speakers of the discom:se aboutthese objects, which reflects "general" backgroundknowledge (77~e dog is a stupid and spiteJ)U ani-mal), The intensional objects are then kinds of"logical" concepts in their world.
The extensionof a world contains objects which are particularto a specific situation, a specific time, ... (Peter'sdog barked all night long).
There is inheritancefrom intension to extension of the same world, butthe extensions of two different worlds do not com-municate.
In case of change of world, a complexinheritance procedure must transmit only knowl-edge which insures the coherence of the new worldfrom the.
old intension to the new one (This, alsostresses tit(; necessity to be able to detect incoher-ence in a discourse).There are three kinds of objects in the model(and hence in any world and universe) : the in-dividual objects, the action schemata \[Gallo andRouault, 1992\] and the state schemata.2.3 The  ind iv idua l  ob jectsIn our model, art individual object has the follow-ing structure:\[Rouault, 1992\]StatusWorldUniverseCardinalityDetinitional partDenominationOther-namesStructuralFunctive2.3.1 StatusThis part imticate the conditions of validity of anobject.
It be composed of several objects:Wor ld  A discourse cart generate worlds.
For eachobject, the system must specify in what world itmust be introduced, where it is valid and wherewe can make inferences that bring it into play.
Wetherefore pose:M e World (I)I is tit(', name of the described object.
"world" isthe formative functor of name, the variable M isthe value of the world that the discourse created.When the knowledge coming from the discourse isincoherent with the knowledge base, there is worldchange.
This change can come equally from a dif-ference of view points between spe.akers expressedin the discourse \[Fredj, :1992\].Universes An universe denotes to a couple (I,I{)formed of an intension (I) and an extension (1{,).The object is defined in the world by a forma-tive %nctor of name, from I \[Berrendonner andRenault, 1991\].U 5 Universe (l)U takes the vahie Inl or Ea:t.Ind iv idua l  and ('lass An object can be an indi-vidual or a class.
This distinction is based on thesingular \[ plural opposition.
The individuality isdefined by a forlnative fimctor of name, from l:In ?
ind~v (I)in takes the value Ind or CI2.3.2 Definit, ional par t  of an ob jectHere, we discovered two kind of sub-objects: thosewhich are part of the described object and thosewhich relate the object descl:ibed a.nd others ob-jects of the world.
The name of an ob.iect repre-sents the sub-object of the denomination.N c de'aomin, al, ion (\[)We also call associate to a name of an object othersynonyms.
These sub-objects arc defined by theformative flmetor of nalne whose the argument isthe name of object.Ni g other-names (I)St ructura l  sub-ob jects  represent he part o\['ingredience, "part-all", in the sens of" the mere-elegy.
It means tltat it describe.s the.
relation be-tween an object and its constitive parts.
They areof the form:I e in~ir (,UObject I i s  a part of objecl, J. i.e.
The 'wheel is aparl of the bike.Functive.
It indicates a relation between the ob-ject considered and another object.
This relationis marked on the surface by a verb or normalisedverbal form \[Berrendonner and al, 1992\].
A func-tive has the following form:f (s; ,J)Where I is the object described and J is the objectwith which i is connected by the functivc f2.4 Pred icat ive  obje('.tsThe functives of an individual object act as rela-tions between objects.
We have to pose the prop-erties of such relations : depending on if they re-fer to  an action or a state, a relation is definedby an action schema or a state schema.
An actionschema contains the following sub-objects \[Galloand Renault, 1992\] : the  name(s) of the action,1140the nature of the arguments,  the state(s) even-l;ually entai led by the action (result, pro(|uct, ...)and the scenario associated to the i)rocess, whi('itdepends on the discourse <lo,min.2.5 S t ructur ing  o f  the  knowledge baseIn the intensional universe of a world, the in(li-viduals (also named types) are nodes of a latt ice(the latt ice o1" types),  the hierarchy l)eing rep-resente.d by t;he ingredient(  fun(tot.
The typesare also l inked by their stru('tura\] and fun(t i resub=ol<jects.
Of course, the extensional objects arc,lmke(\[ also/>y their structural  and functives sub-obje(:ts.
And each such object  is in accord with itsun<lerlying tyl>e.3 Negations in the object-basedknowledge representation model3.1 Negations and objects'\]'\]m aim of the mo(l(;l is to rot)resent dynamical lythe knowledge associated with a (l ist(mrs( at agiven point (t ime) of its progression.
Thus, eachobject  may (;hang( during this progress : we mustthen (l istinguish betwe(:n this "punctu&l" represenCation and the history of objects (which ig isnecessary to maintain in the (:as( of a dialogue,for exaniple).
We are concerned here only withthe updat ing of a knowledge/)ase containing theknowledge valid for a discourse at a given time ofits progression.Un(ier ~his restrict ion, the knowledge stored inthe base is posit ive : when the discern:s( asserts anegat iw ~, fact (Do(is arc not slupid), this presttp-l)OScs that the posit ive corresponding fiu:t (Doqsarc slupid) has ah:e~dy been asserted (exl)l icitly orimpl ic i t ly)  nnd that  a eonl, radict ion may arise.
Ina mono-sl)eaker discourse (text),  the general sit-uat ion seems to be : tim assertion of a negativefact s imply (:rases the positive one (of course, thiserasing is virtual  when the posit ive fact is onlyl>resul)posed).
In a mult i -speaker discourse (dia-logue, for example,  a negot iat ion is sell(able to det ide which of the two possibi l i t ies (the positive orthe negative fact) is to be incht(h~ in the knowledgebase.
In all these cases, we have to be able to inferpropert ies about objects from negative assertions;which in tttrtt, need to re.present the formal prop-erties o\[" different kinds of negations operat ing onsub-objects of an object.3.2  Negat ion  on  typesAs indicate(l  )reviously, only the intensional ob-jects (the types) haw.'
a " h)gical" behaviour : theyrepresent generM knowledge valid in the discourse.The infer('.n(:0~ rules about negations are valid onlyit, the intensional universe.
We then have to de-fine what are the types of negations involved inthe type rel)resentation.3.2.1.
Negat ion  about  the  worhtThe type is negated in the present worhl but mq>posed valid elsewhere.For the linguists, the negation is not a simple problemFor tit(: mathematical logiciau, a negation is a simpleproblemStarting from a worhl where the negation is a, sim-ple problem (which, \[or example, is matheTnatieal lo-gician), thc previous assertion entails tim opening ofa new world, in which the new fact is asserted (7'hencgation is uot a simple problem).
When a discourseis expressed by mono-speaker, the assertion <)f a pos-itive fact (the ncgation is not a simple fact) provokea contradiction i  the same world.
This contradi<:tioncan 1)e based at least on the dill'create betwec.n sub-objects of type: 'is ~, 'is not'.
The solution seeminglysubstitutes a positive fact by a negative fa.ct one.3.2 .2  Negat ion  about  t im un iverseA fact preserLted as a type is negated as such andrelated to extensional objects (or the converse) : 7'hcdoq is not a stupid animal, but Fctcr's is.3.2 .3  Negat ion  about  the  card ina l i tyit is sitnply a change of v;Jtte elf tile, eardinality value.3.2 .4  Negat ion  about  denominat ionsNegation can focus on the "denominations" a.nd"others-names" sub-objects, l)enyi,g a "denomina-tion" or "other- natncs", means to denying a propertyof the object.
\[n this (:a.se, a new prop(~rty is sld)stit,edto a s.b-object.

'The cow docs not cat' is the negation of 'The.
cowcats'2.
'The cow does not ('.at meat' is generally not thenegation of the property 'The cow eats meat amon~t1141other kinds of food)' but the assertion of '27tc cow catssomething' and (,he negation of the choice of meat asfood.
Ifere we still refer to another type having withmeat the satne generic class (food) in the lattice oftypes.3.
We have the same situation in:The cow does not eat with a knifeThe cow does not cat grass with a knifcThc cow does not eat meat in ParisIn these examples, only the choice of the last argumentseems to bc concerned by the negation.3.3 Negat ion  o f  extens iona l  ob jec tsA type underlies extensional objects : a change in theproperties of a type entails the same change in the as-sociated extensional objects.
Of course, the reverse isnot true : an extensionM object may have propertiesnot possessed by the underlying type.
From this it re-salts that the only coherence for an extensional objectis internal : it can not have contradictory sub-objects.Note that ~n extensional object may be an individ-ual or a (:lass ; of course, all the elements of the classmust have the same properties.
\]n fact, class and in-dividual always coexist.
Therefore, it is legal to infera class of type T when the discourse introduces artindividual of type '\['.
This is obvious in 'It is one ofthe neighbour's dogs' and also in ' l ie does not havechildren, only one'.
The last example shows that thenegation of a property about a class may have twointerpretation: the ordinary one, in which the prop-erty is negated for tit(', individual of the class attd thenegation of the (:lass itself (or, conversely, of the in-dividual) to pose the property about an individual (a(:lass).lit the sentence : ' Only Peter came ', we pose a prop-erty Mmttt Peter; then 'only' introduces the class and,of the same time, indicates that the class contains onlyPeter.
This entails that tit(', negation may focus on only(negation that the class contains only one individnM)or on the property (Pcter caste), then asserted about'only Peter'.Another interesting example is 'All students suc-ceed' : we assert a property about the class studentand, then, specify that the class is studious, that is :the property is valid for all individuals of the (:lass.
inother words, that the class is the extensional projec-tion of the type student: As in previous example, (,henegation can operate on all (the class is not studious)or on tire property asserted about ,~11 students.4 CONCLUSIONIn this paper, we have presented an object-basedknowledge representation model that allows to extractand to represent knowledge in the knowledge basefrom discourse.
This model can be used in the contextof man-machine dialogue or for information retrieval.We have posed the problem of coherence as regard-ing the knowledge represented in the knowledge base,taking into account he apparent contradictions withindiscourse.
The incoherence can be result fi:om a lot ofphenomena but we restrict ourselves in this commu-nication to incoherence stemming from negation.
Allthe cases treated (among others) show that a surfacenegation does not always fit a deep negation and, infact, seldom entails ~n incoherence.
Consequently, thenegation cart have art effect in object-based knowledgerepresentation model such as to update properties ofobjects but it rztrely provobe ~n incoherence betweenthe objects of discourse and the objects of knowledgebase,ReferencesAchouba S., Rouault J.
