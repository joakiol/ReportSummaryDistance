These tasks require large-scale language re-sources (LRs) developed either manually or semi-automatically.
Building them from scratch, however,is a laborious and costly task, and re-using and repurposing already existing ones is a solution to thisbottleneck.
We hereby present work aimed at the extension and enrichment of existing general-purposeLRs, namely a set of computational lexica, and their integration in a new emotion lexicon that would beapplicable for a number of Natural Language Processing applications beyond mere syntactic parsing.1 IntroductionThe abundance of user-generated content over the web has brought about the shift of interest to theopinion and emotion expressed by people or groups of people with respect to a specific target entity,product, subject matter, etc.
The task of sentiment analysis involves determining the so-called privatestates (beliefs, feelings, and speculations) expressed in a particular text or text segment as opposed tofactual information.
More precisely, it is focused on the following: (a) identification of sentiment ex-pressions in textual data and their classification as appropriate, and (b) recognition of participants inthe private state, as for example, the entities identified as the Source and Target of the emotion.
Morerecently, aspect-based sentiment analysis has also been in the focus of research (Wilson, 2008).Traditionally, classification of sentiment expressions is usually attempted in terms of the generalnotion of polarity defined as positive, negative and neutral.
Traditional approaches to text classifica-tion based on stochastic methods are quite effective when applied for sentiment analysis yielding quitesatisfactory results.
However, certain applications require for more fine-grained classifications of sen-timent i.e.
the identification of emotional states such as anger, sadness, surprise, satisfaction, etc.
inplace of mere recognition of the polarity.
Such applications might be the identification of certain emo-tions expressed by customers (i.e., satisfaction, or dissatisfaction) with respect to some product or ser-vice, or the analysis of emotions and feelings described by users in blogs, wikis, fora and social media(Klenner at al., 2009).
In this respect, stochastic approaches fail to recognize multiple or even conflict-ing emotions expressed in a document or text segment.
In these cases, linguistic (syntactic and seman-tic knowledge) is necessary in order to assess the overall polarity of a clause and or the feeling ex-pressed in it.The paper is organised as follows: In section 2 we present the aims and scope of the specific work;section 3 gives an overview of related work on affective LRs, whereas section 4 gives an account ofthe LRs developed within the framework of Lexicon ?
Grammar.
Our efforts towards enriching theexisting resources with semantic information and re-purposing them are presented in sections 5 and 6respectively, while section 7 outlines our conclusions and prospects for future research.2 Aims and scopeWe present work aimed at extending, enriching and re-purposing existing LRs, the ultimate goal beingThis work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

In specific, a suite of computational lexica developedwithin the framework of Lexicon ?
Grammar (LG) and treating verbal and nominal predicates denot-ing emotion were used.
These resources were initially constructed manually as a means to describegeneral language, and they bear rich linguistic information that would be otherwise difficult to encodein an automatic way, namely (a) subcategorisation information, (b) semantic and distributional proper-ties, and (c) syntactic transformations of the predicates.
Within the current work, semantic informationthat is meaningful for sentiment analysis was also added to lexicon entries.
The final resource wasthen used to bootstrap a grammar of emotions.
This grammar is a rule-based approach to sentimentanalysis aimed at capturing and modeling linguistic knowledge that is necessary for the task at hand.The work presented here was based on a previous study (Giouli et al., 2013), making further exten-sive use of the Hellenic National Corpus (HNC), a large reference corpus for the Greek language(Hatzigeorgiou et al, 2000).
Additionally, a suite of specialized corpora that were developed to guidesentiment studies in multimodal (Mouka et al., 2012) and in textual (Giouli and Fotopoulou, 2013)data was used.
Thus, the resulting Greek Sentiment Corpus, that amounts to c. ~250K tokens, com-prises audiovisual material (movies dialogues), and texts selected manually from various sources overthe web.
More particularly, the online edition of two newspapers along with a news portal weresearched on a daily basis for the identification and selection of commentaries dealing with a set ofpredefined topics; Greek blogs and fora were also used as sources for text collection.
The afore-mentioned corpus was annotated at the sentence and phrase level for opinion and emotion, and wassubsequently used to populate the sentiment lexicon under construction.
Moreover, initial steps weremade towards creating a rule-based system for the identification of sentiment expressions in texts andcomputing the overall phrase polarity in context on the basis of corpus evidence.3 Related workA number of large-scale lexica appropriate for sentiment analysis have been developed either manual-ly or semi-automatically.
These range from mere word lists to more elaborate resources.
General In-quirer (Stone et al.
1966), the Subjectivity lexicon integrated in OpinionFinder (Wiebe et al., 2005),and SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani 2006) are examples of such affective lexica.
On the otherhand, WordNet-Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti 2004), an extension of WordNet Domains, is linguis-tically oriented as it comprises a subset of synsets that are suitable to represent affective concepts incorrelation with affective words.
A set of A-labels is used to mark concepts representing emotions oremotional states, moods, eliciting emotions situations, and emotional responses.
Finally, EmotiNet(Balahur et al, 2011) is a knowledge base (KB) for representing and storing affective reaction to real-life contexts and action chains described in text.From a purely linguistic perspective ?
yet with a view to Natural Language Processing - substantialwork has been devoted to the semantic classification of verbal predicates denoting emotion in(Mathieu, 1999).
In this work, verbs denoting emotional states and evaluative stances should also beclassified according to the so-called semantic field?.
Verbs were, thus, categorized into homogenoussemantic classes which share common syntactic properties; this classification is claimed to facilitatesemantic interpretation.Statistical approaches to sentiment analysis feature a ?bag-of-word?
representation (Hu and Liu,2004).
Rule-based systems, on the other hand, exploit linguistic knowledge in the form of syntac-tic/lexical patterns for computing polarity in context.
In most cases, negative particles and modalityare reported as the most obvious shifters that affect sentiment polarity (Polanyi and Zaenen 2006, Jiaet al.
2009, Wiegand et al.
2010, Benamara et al., 2012).
Finally, compositionality features have beenexplored for the computation of multiple or conflicted sentiments on the basis of deep linguistic analy-sis (Moilanen and Pulman, 2007), (Neviarouskaya et al., 2009), (Klenner et al., 2009).4 Lexicon ?
Grammar tables4.1 Lexicon ?
Grammar frameworkThe Lexical Resources hereby exploited were initially constructed in accordance with the Lexicon-Grammar (LG) methodological framework (Gross 1975), (Gross 1981).
Being a model of syntax lim-ited to the elementary sentences of the form Subject ?
Verb ?
Object, the theory argues that the unit of40meaning is located at the sentence rather than the word level.
To this end, linguistic analysis consistsin converting each elementary sentence to its predicate-argument structure.
Additionally, main com-plements (subject, object) are separated from other complements (adjuncts) on the basis of formal cri-teria; adverbial complements (i.e., prepositional phrases) are considered as crucial arguments only inthe case that they characterize certain verb frames:(1)  John removed the cups from the table.To cater for a more fine-grained classification, and the creation of homogenous word classes, thisformal syntactic definition is further coupled with distributional properties associated with words, i.e.,types of prepositions, features attached to nouns in subject and complement positions, etc.
A set oftransformation rules, construed as equivalence relations between sentences, further generate equivalentstructures.
It becomes evident, therefore, that the resulting resources are rich in linguistic information(syntactic structure, distributional properties and permitted transformational rules), which is encodedformally in the so-called LG tables.4.2 The Lexicon ?
Grammar of verb and noun predicates denoting emotionWithin the LG framework, 130 noun predicates denoting emotions (Nsent) in Modern Greek were se-lected and classified into 3 classes, according to their syntactic and distributional properties(Fotopoulou & al., 2008).
The 1st class comprises nouns of interpersonal relations with an obligatoryprepositional complement and a conversed construction, as for example ?????????
(= admiration).The 2nd class are indicative of an external cause including a non obligatory prepositional complement,as for example ?????
(= fear).
The 3rd class without complements have a static character, as for ex-ample ???????
(= happiness).
Identification of the specific light verbs (or support verbs, Vsup) theyselect for was also performed.
Furthermore, their distributional properties and their co-occurrence withspecific verbs expressing diverse modalities (aspect, intensity, control, manifestation or verbal expres-sion) have also been encoded in a formal way.
These properties reveal the restrictions nouns imposeon the lexical choice of verbs.Furthermore, 339 Greek verbal predicates denoting emotion (Vsent) have been selected from vari-ous sources (i.e.
existing reference lexicographic works and corpora) and were subsequently classifiedin five LG tables.
Classification was performed on the basis of the following axes: (i) syntactic infor-mation (i.e, subcategorisation information); (ii) selectional restrictions (+Hum/ -Hum) imposed overtheir Subject and Object complements; and (iii) transformation rules.
More precisely, as far as syntac-tic structure is concerned, the predicates under consideration were identified to appear in both transi-tive and intransitive constructions being represented as ?0 V N1 and ?0 V respectively.
Certain verbsalso allow for a prepositional phrase complement represented as ?0 V Prep N11 configurations.
Aclose inspection over the data revealed the relationship between the N0 or N1 complements that de-note the Experiencer of the emotion (i.e., the entity feeling the emotion).
In two of the resulting clas-ses the Experiencer is projected as the structural Subject of the verb, whereas the Theme or Stimulus isprojected as their structural object.
Similarly, the remaining 3 classes realize the Theme/Stimulus as thesubject and the Experiencer as their object, their distinguishing property being their participation inunaccusative and middle constructions, the latter being linked to the implicit presence of an Agent(middle) and the absence of an Agent (unaccusative).
These properties have been checked for thewhole range of lexical data based on both linguistic introspection and corpus evidence.A number of Harrisian constructions and transformations (Harris, 1951; 1964; 1968) have been ex-tensively utilized within the LG formalism to define syntactically related and semantically equivalentstructures.
Apart from passivisation and middle alternation constructions - also relevant to emotionpredicates - the restructuring transformation has been accounted for (Guillet and Lecl?re, 1981):(2) ?

A number of semantically equivalent paraphrases of the verbs with the morphologi-cally related nouns and adjectives were also encoded in the tables.Finally, following the same methodology, a set of 2,500 verbal multi-word expressions denotingemotions were identified from corpora and classified in 13 categories according to their syntacticstructure.
The final resource comprises a total of ~3000 entries, organized in 21 LG tables with lem-mas inter-connected via the tables relative to verbs.5 Semantic classification of emotion predicatesSemantic classification of the verbal predicates has also been performed on the basis of their underly-ing semantics.
In this way, the syntactic and distributional properties encoded in the LG tables havebeen coupled with semantic information that defines an affective taxonomy.
These properties wereadded as columns in the tables that describe the verb predicates.
Our goal was to group together predi-cates that are synonyms or near synonyms and to create an affective taxonomy hierarchical organized.To this end, certain abstractions and generalizations were performed where necessary for definingclasses of emotion types.Initially, 59 classes of emotion-related-senses were identified.
At the next stage, a number of itera-tions followed aimed at grouping together senses that are semantically related.
This procedure resultedin the identification of a set of senses that may be used as taxonomy of emotions.
Following practicesadopted in similar endeavours (i.e., Mathieu, 1999), each class was further assigned a tag that uniquelyidentifies the respective class.
The following classes (19 classes) were identified: anger, fear, sadness,disgust, surprise, anticipation, acceptance, joy, love, hate, disappointment, indifference, shame, envy,jealousy, relaxedness, respect, resentment, and remorse.Next, each entry was further specified as regards the specific relation that holds between the entryand the emotion type it belongs to.
A set of properties were then defined for which each entry was thenexamined, namely: FeelEmotion, EmotionManifestation, Behaviour, and EntailsEmotion.At a more abstract level, entries were further assigned a value for the semantic property polarity.Following previous works (Mathieu and Fellbaum, 2010), the encoding caters for the apriori polarityof the emotion denoted which subsumes one of the following values: (a) positive, i.e.
predicates whichexpress a pleasant feeling; (b) negative, i.e., predicates which express an unpleasant feeling; (c) neu-tral, and (d) ambiguous, i.e., predicates expressing a feeling the polarity of which is context-dependent(e.g., surprise).Moreover, to better account for the semantic distinction between near synonyms that occur within aclass such as ???????
(= I am scared), ??????????????
(=panic), etc., entries are further coupled withthe feature intensity with possible values: low, medium, high, uncertain.
Intensity was attributed to thelexical items on the basis of linguistic introspection and the definitions of lexical entries.6 Transforming Lexicon-Grammar tables to a grammar of emotionsBeing initially developed to serve as a means of linguistic description, this framework has, never-the-less, been proved to be applicable for the construction of robust computational lexica.
And although ithas been claimed (Mathieu, 2008) that the information is not directly exploitable for NLP applicationsdue to the fact that certain pieces of information are not formally encoded or are implicit, a number ofworks (Hathout and Namer 1998, Danlos and Sagot 2009) have successfully managed to reformat LGtables in efficient large-scale NLP lexica.To this end, we have tried to exploit information available in the tables and make the mappings thatare necessary for the task of sentiment recognition.
On the one hand, subcategorisation informationwith respect to selectional restrictions imposed over the Subject and Object of the verbal predicateswas exploited.
Once a verbal predicate has been identified, the constituent either in Subject or Object42position that is also assigned a (+Hum) property corresponds unambiguously to the Experiencer of theemotion depending on the class it belongs to (i.e., SubjectExperiencer or Object Experiencer).
Simi-larly, the NP in Object position of verbs that pertain to the 2nd class ?????
(=love) corresponds to theTarget of the emotion.
All other constituents correspond to the Trigger or Cause.On these grounds, initial steps towards building a rule-based component that identifies emotion ver-bal and nominal predicates in texts along with the participating entities, namely the Experiencer andTarget of the emotion expressed have been performed.
To this end, a library of local grammars (Con-stant, 2003) for emotion predicates has been constructed modeling structures in the annotated corpus.Local grammars (also referred to in the literature as graphs) are algebraic grammars formulated ascombinations of sequences of grammatical symbols in the form of regular expressions that describenatural language.
In this sense, they are a powerful tool to represent the majority of linguistic phenom-ena in an intuitive manner.
Moreover, they are compiled into finite state transducers that transforminput text by inserting or removing special markers.
Rules are sequentially applied to the text usinglongest match.
We made use of the UNITEX platform (Paumier, 2013) for creating the graphs andthen compiling them into finite state transducers.
UNITEX consists of three modules, namely, corpushandling, lexicon development and grammar development that are integrated into a single intuitivegraphical user interface.
Based on the Lexicon-Grammar tables developed for the verbal predicates(c.f.
section 2 above), we initially created five parameterized graphs manually; these graphs depict thesyntactic and semantic properties of the predicates.
At the next stage, a set of graphs was constructedautomatically using UNITEX, each one representing the syntactic and semantic properties of a givenpredicate.It should be noted, however, that LG tables provide descriptions at an abstract level.
To remedy thisshortcoming, a number of graphs and sub-graphs describing a wide range of syntactic phenomena(noun phrase, coordination, modifiers, negation, and valency shifters) were constructed manually.
Theset of graphs comprises a grammar applied to the text as a cascade for the identification of the emotivepredicate, being either verbal or nominal, its polarity and the participants of the emotion event that canbe identified from the underlying structure ?
namely the Experiencer and the Theme and the Cause.7 Conclusions and future workWe have described work aimed at enriching, re-purposing and re-using already available LRs for anew task, namely identification of emotion expressions in texts.
The existing lexica carry rich linguis-tic information which has been mapped onto categories that are meaningful for the task.
Our effortshave been oriented towards developing a rule-based system that efficiently will eventually recogniseemotion expressions in texts and the participants in the emotion event.Future work has been planned already, consisting of the exploitation of other properties that are en-coded in the LG tables, as for example the restructuring property as a facet of the aspect-based senti-ment analysis and the conversion of the enriched LG tables to a standardised lexical format.
Finally,the validation of the final resource is due against the manually annotated corpus.AcknowledgmentsThe research within the project LangTERRA: Enhancing the Research Potential of ILSP/?Athena?R.C.
