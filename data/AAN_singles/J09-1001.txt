Letter to the EditorDear Editor:I foundmyself in agreement with your recent (Dec. 2008) enumeration of the difficultieswith ACL conferences, and the general problem posed by a field whose primary meansof communication is the conference paper.
I want to point out another problem withthis state of affairs: conference papers entail conference travel.
A humble linguisticsprofessor at a California State University campus has essentially no funding and arelatively low salary, so the opportunity to jet-set around the world to an ACL meetingis hardly available.I would much prefer a computational linguistics research community whose primarymeans of communicating completed research is the journal paper, not the conferencepaper.
The expectation that one presents at conferences is fundamentally elitist, asit effectively excludes those of us without grants or funding.
It would be foolish toassume that all such individuals are busy performing ?bad?
research.
Yet without asubstantial increase in the number of available journal pages in our field, there will belimited opportunity in the near future for those in less wealthy surroundings to see theirresearch in print.Sincerely,Sean Fulop, PhDAssistant Professor of LinguisticsCalifornia State University Fresno?
