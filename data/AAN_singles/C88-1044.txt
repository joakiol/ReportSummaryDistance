INTRODUCTIONThe primary purpose of this paper is to present aset of necessaryand sufficient conditions for the use of demonstrative expressionsin English, based on a corpus of naturally occurring discoursefrom a variety of spoken and written genres.
We propose acomprehensive s t of constraints on demonstrative use and sug-gest how they can be incorporated into a computational pro-cessing model which integrates the local centering and global fo-cusing aspects of discourse structure.
Finally we show how ourproposed algorithm for demonstratives can account for stressedpronouns as well.Existing computational work on demonstratives has beenbased on examples from only three genres: experimentally-elicited apartment descriptions (Linde 1979), technical dialogues(Reichman-Adar 1984), and scientific textbooks (Sidner 1983).Testing computational gorithms against multiple genres ofnatural discourse is important, especially given the universalscope of current frameworks (cf.
Grosz and Sidner 1986).
Wehave chosen to systematically examine texts from a broad rangeof genres, which vary in spoken versus written medium, numberof participants, degree of pre-planning, and formality of situa-tion.
These genres include informal conversation, partially-spontaneous televised discussion, newspaper articles, andplanning and technical documents.2.
REVIEW OF THE LITERATUREDemonstratives have generally been considered to be one type ofdeictic expression.
Most of the linguistic literature on deixis hasconcentrated on classifying deictic expressions according tovarious parameters such as the linguistic or extralinguistic statusof the referent.
For example, Buhler (1982) distinguishes be-tween demonstratio ad oculos, anaphora, and deixis at phan-tasma, whose intended referents are respectively found in the ex-tralinguistic ontext, the linguistic context, or in memory orimagination.
Similarly, Fillmore (1975) distinguishes gestural,anaphorie and symbolic uses of deictic expressions; and Lakoff(1974) distinguishes spatio-temporal, discourse, and emotionaldeixis.
Such distinctions have been useful as a basis for descrip-tive classification of various uses of demonstrative expressions,but we do not feel that they are relevant for an explanatory ac-count of demonstrative function and so shall not elaborate furtheron them here.
For the same reason we also will not discuss at-tempts to show that discourse deixis and/or anaphora is derived?
from or less prototypical than spatio4emporal deixis (of., Lyons1977; Fillmore 1982).
Our account is more compatible with the*The work presented here was partially supported under Control DataCorporation Grant #86M102 and a grant from the University of MinnesotaGraduate School (Jeanette Gundel, Larry Hutchinson and Michael Kac,Principal Investigators).

It is this view which most closelyreflects the assumptions underlying computationaUy explicitmodels of focus-constrained discourse processing (e.g., Linde1979; Reichman 1985; Grosz and Sidner 1986).We turn now to a presentation f specific claims aboutdemonstratives which have been made in the literature.Focus shift.a.
That but not it may be used to refer to an item no longer infocus (Linde 1979).
That marks the end of a discoursesection (Reichman 1984, 1985).
This but not that signalsfocus movement, except when this occurs in the scope ofa quantifier or when its head noun is not identical to thehead noun of an existing immediate focus (Sidner 1983).b.

That may be used to indicate conwast, even for items cur-rently in focus (Linde 1979).
When this and that are usedtogether contrastively ('copresent' use), this specifies theprimary, continuing focus and that specifies a secondary,temporary focus (Sidner 1983).Prox imity .a.
This is used to denote objects relatively close to thespeaker and that for objects relatively far from the speakeror relatively close to the hearer.

Both this and that may corefer with elements in the pre-ceding linguistic ontext, but only th& may eorefer withelements in the following linguistic ontext.
(Fillmore1975, 1982; HaUiday and Hasan 1976; Lakoff 1974).c.
Both this and that can be used to comment upon aspeaker's own prior remarks, with this often signallinggreater speaker involvement or continued iscussion.Only that may be used to comment upon the remarks ofanother speaker (Halliday and Hasan 1976; Lakoff 1974;Sidner 1983).d.
The interval denoted by a determiner this used with a timeexpression includes the speech time.
(Fillmore 1975).That tends to be associated with a past time referent andthis with one in the present or future.
(Fillmore 1975;Halliday and Hasan 1976).Special effects.a.
Demonstratives often have subtle emotional effects uchas solidarity, distancing, sympathy, anger, irony, etc.
(Lakoff 1974, Fillmore 1982; Halliday mad Hasan 1976).b.
Unstressed determiner this has an indefinite specific usein colloquial narrative speech, (Lakoff 1974); sharedattention and experience (Halliday and Hasan 1976);topicality (Prince 1981a)c. Unstressed determiner that phrases have a first-mentionuse for expected shared referents.

CONSTRAINTS ON DEMONSTRATIVE USEThe basic concepts which we take to be crUcial for any adequatedescription of demonstxatives are ones which are central to a the-ory of reference in general.
These are concepts uch as topic, fo-cus and various types of givenness.
Since these concepts con-cern the cognitive status of a referent, definitions have often beeniough and iatuitive, bv.
:dcatiy con'ect but ~tot sufflcieLitly precisefor eonlput~;ikmal iu plcmctmttion.
On the oilier hand, because ofthe conlpledty of these concepts, attempts to ihrnish ntore pre-cise opcrallonal definitions, e.g.
on the basis of surlhce line.

(1) i couldn't sleep last night.
My neighbors have thisdog that kept me awake.We will be primarily concerned hete with definite nounphrases, where the speaker expects the addressee to uniquelyidentify the mlin'cnt on tile basis of the description in question.Th,e rcfe,e~lts of such expressions have often been characterizedas 'given'.
tlowevcr, as pointed out by Gundcl (1978a, 1978b)and l'rince (1981h), givcnness is not a mfitary concept.
Therearc diil'ereat senses of givenness each of which is relevant to theRn'm of reicc,'ittg expr,-ssions, but in different ways.hletttil iabitity.
In the weakest sense of givcnness, the slmakerexpects the addressee to uniquely identify the referent, but thebasis for th: identification is iiTelevant.
Not only can it be lin-guistic or extralingttistic, based on entities in immediate or longterm memory, but it need not he based on any previous haredexperience ;:it all (cf.
lIawkins 1978).
The basis/'or the identifi-cation may be enc~led in lhe form itselt, as in (2).
(2) I couldn't sleep last night.
The ne ig l tboes dogkept me awake.This type of givenness, which we rctisr to as identitiability, isboth necessary and Slffficient ot the use of deliniie articles.Shared t'alailiarity.
Most identifiable ntities are identifiablebecause of some shared experience between speaker and aft.dressec; again this may be linguistic or exlralinguistic, based onlocal colRext or hmg term menuLly associated with shared culturalor personal expt:rienct:.
It is tiffs slattls which we claint is neces-sary for the use of demonstrative expressions (with the exceptionof indcfinit,~ this ).
Thus, (3) unlike (2), is li:licitous only if theaddressee has prior knowledge of the dog in question.
(3) I couldn't sleep last night.
That  dog next doorkept me awake.ActilzatioJii.
Entities which are fantiliar on the basis of presencein the imnlcdiate discourse context (either linguistic or extralin-gnistic) are not only shared but 'in awareness.'
This sense ofpjvcmless, which wc reler to as 'activated,' (of.
Chafe 1976,Gundel 1978b, Haji~fov;i and Vrbovfi 1982) is necessary torpronominal reference, including pronominal demonstratives.Thus, that' in (4) could only r~:li:r to the bmkiog of a dog if this\[lad lrg;eu ac~ivaR;d b) r the hnnu-diatc discourse context:(4) 1 couldn't sleep last night.
That kept me awake.Activation is also a necessary condition for determiner this.Demonstcative this, both pronominal and definite determiner, hasthe additional condition that it not only be activated but speaker-activated, either linguistically or extralinguistically b virtue of itsinclusion in the speakers context space, as in (5):(5) A: Have you seen the neighbors new dog?B: Yes, and that dog kept me awake all night.B': ?
?Yes, and this dog kept me awake all night.\[r~ focus.
Finally, the most highly activated entities are not onlyin the speaker's arid ltearer's awareness but are the center ofattention at ;t particular point in the discourse.
We refer to thisstatus as 'in focus.'
Entities in .focus 1always include at least thetopic of the sentence as well as any higher level discourse topicswhich may not be overtly represented in the sentence itself.
Un-der certain conditions, they may also include other elements suchas the reference of the linguistic focus.
Thus a shift in focus al-ways entails a shift in topic but not vice versa.
The status 'in to-otis' is a necessary condition for unstressed pronomlnals and alsofor zero anaphora (cf.
Gundel 1978b).The rehtlionship between tile various (definite) referentialstatuses and the forms that colTelate with them is shown in (6).These statuses are in a unidirectional implication rclation such thatany status on lhe hierarchy implies all statuses higher on the hier-urchy but not vice-.versa:(6) G IVENNESS I I IERARCI IY :in focus --> act ivated --> slmred --> identif iableit that, this fllat N the Nthis N40 CRIT IQUE OF CLAIMS IN TI lE L ITERATURE.Focus Shift.
Observations regarding the focus shift functiou ofdemonstratives follow naturally from the theory outlined abovegiven two additional, but uncontroversial ssumptions -- thatpronominal it is necessarily unstressed and that the overwhelmingmajority of definite noun phrases are not only uniquely identifi-ahle, but shared.
As noted above, the prinlary distinction betweendemonstrative pronouns and unstressed personal pronouns is thatthe referents of the latter must not only be activated, but in focus.A pronominal whose referent is not currently in focus isnecessarily stressed (cf.
Hirschbcrg and Pierrehumbert 1986).Since it is necessarily nnstressed, the only third person singularneuter pronominals available for focus shift are the demonstra-tives that and this.
This accounts for the distribution of that ver-sus it noted by Linde (1979) as well as the uses of that noted byReichman.
Use of that in referring to previous tatements (alsonoted by both these authors) is just a special case of focus shift,since the focus of attention at the point "after a statement is made istypically not the statement i self.
However, our data does notsupport Sidner's (1983) claim that this but not that is used forfocus movement.
Exatnplcs illustrating the focus shift functionof pronominal this and that include the following:(7) K i: And..So what he DID was ...came in, set up thefree...2: and then he nlade wassail, with rum in it'?3: And..made it in coffee cans and heated it on thestove in the graduate lounge.A 4: Oh, gee.K 5: And  this was the solstice tree.lu (7), tile topic and hence the focus of attention in K5 is the tree,which is activated by its mention in K1 thus licensing tilelThere is some confusion in tile literature resulting from the fact that tileterm 'focus' has been used in two distinct and at least partly opposite ways (cfIlaji~.bv~ 1987).
We use 'in focus' to refer to tile psychological notion offocus of attention (tlaji~ovgs focUSAl) and 'linguistic focus' to lefer to tilepoint of linguistic prominence in tim sentence (the comment).2117use of a pronominal.
However, since it is not in focus in K2,K3, and A4, the reference to it in K5 constitutes a focus shiftand thus requires aslxessed emonstrative form.
Note that sincethe tree was speaker activated, either this or that could be used.
(8) N 1: I like the poor dog who was buried six times inone day!K 2: Oh.
That must, that must be a story that comesfrom the Second Minnesota history,3: because that didn't appear in the, in the ah di-ary,4: so it must have come from somewhere,In (8), the topic and hence focus of K2 is the story.Since the story is activated but not in focus in N1 (the focus ofattention in N1 is stories that N likes), reference to the story inK2 constitutes a focus shift and thus requires a stresseddemonstrative.
Note that the story continues to be topic (in focus)in K3 and K4 and that in K3, an unstressed pronominal it couldhave been used instead of that.
(9) N 1: "Bob loves Mary",2: and someone lse wrote "Mary loves Jim"3: and I wrote "Jim loves Bob"!
(laughter)4: It was three different handwritings, three differ-ent people.K 5: Yeah, that's good.
(9) illustrates the use of that to refer to a previous tatement orutterance.
Since that refers to the topic of K5, the story activatedin N1-4 (but not in focus), use of that constitutes a focus shift.The focus shift function of determiner that (cf.
Reichman1984) can be explained as a consequence of Grice's maxim ofquantity, specifically don't be more informative than necessary(cf.
Grice, 1975).
Since the overwhelming majority of definitenoun phrases refer to entities that are shared, use of a demon-strative determiner as opposed to the less restrictive definite arti-cle in most instances carries little additional information.
Thus ademonstrative d terminer is generally used only when the sig-nalling of shared familiarity has some additional communicativefunction.
This is the case when there is a shift in focus, as in(10) and (11), since a focus shift always entails a shift in topicand topics are necessarily shared (cf.
Gundel 1985).In the particular case of (10), there is not enough infor-mation encoded in the noun phrase itself to allow the addressee touniquely identify the referent.
Thus a demonstrative (as opposedto a definite article) is required in order to link the referent upwith entities hared as a result of immediate discourse context.
In(1 lb) on the other hand, the demonstrative functions imply tosignal a focus shift and therefore a definite article would beequally appropriate.
(10) a. John, this speech was a magnificent triumph for thePresident.
He showed he could stay awake fortwelve whole minutes.
He showed that he couldspeak every word off of his teleprompter, even thelong ones.
But the speech doesn't have any chanceof putting the scandal behind him, because thescandal is not about mistakes, as he said, and it'snot about mismanagement, as the Tower Commis-sion said.
It is about a betrayal of principles, it'sabout lying, and it's about breaking the law.b.
And those issues remain.
\[McLaughlin 3/6/87\].
(11) a.
These incredibly small magnetic bubbles are thevanguard of a new generation of ultradense mem-ory-storage systems.b.
These systems are extremely rugged:c. they are resistant to radiation and are nonvolatile.Contrast.
The contrastive function of demonstratives, like thefocus shift function, is related to the fact that contrast is markedby stress and pronominal it cannot carry stress.
Moreover, con-trast may be just a special case of focus shift, since a eontrastivenoun phrase always brings into focus other entities with which itis being contrasted, as illustrated in (12):(12) a.
In both cycle steal mode and DPC, the attachmenifeature...responds with a condition code.b.
For commands that do not require interrupts (that is,commands executed under DPC), the eonditi~mcode provides current device status information.c.
For commands that require xecutiou in cycle stealmode followed by an inten'upt request, this firstcondition code provides information concerningacceptance of the command by the attachmentfeature.d.
Upon interrupt servicing by the processor, the a ttachment feature provides a second conditioncode and an interrupt word.Thus, the referent of thisfirst condition code in (12c) is alreadyin focus since it is also the topic of (12b).
However, ,dnce theuse of this noun phrase brings into tbcus contrasting conditioncodes (cf.
a second condition code in (12d)) it is not onlycontrastive, but constitutes an implicit focus shift as wellProximity.
The speaker-activated condition on this predictscorrectly that both this and that can comment upon a speaker'sown prior remark as in examples (7) and (10) respectively, butonly that can be used to comment upon the remarks of anotherspeaker, as illustrated by example (9).The same condition also explains why this is used for ex-tralinguistic objects relatively close to the speaker and that forthose relatively further away as in (13), and why the interval de ~noted by determiner this includes peech time, while that tends tobe associated with some time prior to speech time as in (14)This is so because speaker-activated means not only linguisticallyactivated but activated within the speaker's context space.
(13) N: This tastes like water.
This tastes like THAT!Waita minute--the stuff that's $1.99 for two quartshastes a- the same as one that's $2.07 for a fifth.
(14) K: There he was that  hairy hound from Buodapest/Never leaving us alone./Never have I everknown/a ruder pestSpecial Effects.
As seen in the diagram in (6), each of thereferential statuses i also correlated as a necessary condition fora different ype of definite reference.
Since the statuses areimplicationally related, reference with a particular form willgenerally imply appropriateness of reference with all forms asso-ciated with a status higher on the hierarchy, but not vice-versa.Thus, pronominal that in (13) may be replaced with that wine andthese systems in ( l lb)  can be replaced with the systems.However, not all cases of the N are replaceable with that N, asillustrated in (2) and (3); and not all cases of that N arereplaceable with that., as illustrated in (3) and (4).The maxim of quantity would dictate that speakers willuse the strongest possible form, i.e.
will signal the most infor-mation as is relevant regarding the givenness status of the entityin question.
The same maxim predicts that speakers would notuse a stronger form than necessary in a given situation, i.e.
theywill not signal more information than is appropriate.
Violation ineither direction will often result in a special effect or implicature,as in (15), where the use of this as opposed to the equallyappropriate he conveys an effect of solidarity:(15) Gov.
D (from videotapel: I've got the energy to ranthis marathon, the slrength to run this country,the experience to manage our government, and thevalues to lead our people.
\[McLaughlin, 3/20/871We already noted that use of a demonstrative d termineroften has a special effect, such as signalling a topic shift, becausevirtually all definite NPs are also shared, and thus demonstrativedeterminers do not normally convey much more infommtion thanwould be conveyed by the definite article.
Similarly, in caseswhere the referent is not activated, eterminer that acts as an ove~signal to the addressee to search long term memoxy for thereferent, as in (16):218(16) A: Yet* can get those little magic f i~ger jnbbiesihat tell you when ~o water  ~t.

Demonstrat ives ik~ casual eo~versat ionsOther Speaker 's  Remarks?
A large proportion of pronom-inal that in the casual conversations is due to its use for refer..ence to an immediately preceding contribution of another conver-sational pardcipm~t.
For an example see 0 )  above.As noted above, pronominal and determiner this requirethat the referent be speaker-activated.
Thus we would expect ofind that used extensively in any nmltiple-participant discourse,such as casaal conversation.
While, we do have five exceptionsto this gene,:alization, where this is used to refer to an entity acti-vated by tt,: addressee, all of these are clarification questions requesting re:,'erent identification, perhaps conveying polite inten-tion to not iaten'upt, as in (17):(17) iq: So yesterday I finished up the day's work and put itin gear and nothing happened.

Typically such phrases include a relative clausespecifying additional information to aid in the search and areoften embedded in a request for confirmation that the referent gasindeed been located..
Since the referent is shared but not acti-vated, it frequently occurs in left-dislocated constructions whichhave tile lunction of introducing or reintroducing a topic into thediscourse.

Demonstratives in televised discussionsDiscourse topic this.
The televised iscussions aredistinguished from the casual conversations by the frequent useof this to refer to non-speaker activated entities.
Such usescontradict our claim that this" must be speaker-activated.
Toaccount for such examples, we suggest that a distinction be madebetween inclusive and exclusive speaker space, in the case oflocal discourse segments, peaker space often excludes the ad-dressee, but with higher-level discourse topics, which are oftenshm'ed, speaker space includes the addressee.
In such cases,which are characteristic of highly sl'uctured interactions, this' maybe used for something which was not initially activated by thespeaker.
In (20), reference is made to the explicit discourse topicof' tlm segment, Gorbachev's decision ot to cancel the smnnfit:1The categories Same Speaker and Other Speaker include only referentswhich are locally activated in the immediately preceding utterance.
Thus,they ate rnutually exclusive with the category of discourse topic.219(20) G: The business of trying to play Kremlinologist onthis decision, I think it's simpler than that.
I re-ally think that Reagan looked very, very vulnerableat that time.
It was the thing for Gorbacbev to do,and he just misread it.
\[McLaughlin, tO/30/87,21\]5.3  Planned, non- interact ive genres.
Tables 4-6 showthe distribution of demonstratives in newspaper stories (NewYork Times "Week in Review" section, 6-11/87); a University ofMinnesota dministrative planning document; and an electronicspecification document supplied by Control Data Corporation.A characteristic of these non-interactive, written genres isa relatively high percentage of determiner this.
This may be part-ly attributable tothe fact that everything that is activated is speak-er activated.
In addition, there are malay time expressions withthis in the newspaper articles and metadiscourse references suchas this document in the planning document.
Unlike thediscourse-topic use in the televised iscussions, referents ofdeterminer this in the written genres are typically activated in tileimmediately preceding sentence and constitute a focus shift.that that N this this N Totaln-0 t 3 1 1 3 8n-1 9 11 3 12 35n-2+ -- 2 1 15 18Time-Person-Place -- 2 1 17 2 0Forward .

Demonst ra t ives  in specif ication documentInformative this.
A use of determiner this expressions whichis found exclusively in the non-interactive g nres is to informa-tively redescribe a referent.
In the newspaper stories, these aretypically redescriptions of topical referents (already in focus)which would have been specifiable with an unstressed pronoun ifthe extra material had not been included, as in (22).
Althoughspeakers generally use the strongest possible form of referringexpression, here a weaker form is being used for a specialreason, namely to introduce new information i  the noun part.
(22) Nearly lost in the polemic was Judge Kennedyhimself.
That was ironic, because in many waysthis former small-city lawyer with the sta-ble marriage and three attractive childrenand the fine reputatiou appears to personify justthose values that made the image of Ronald Reaganso attractive after the convulsions of the 1960's and1970's.
\[New York Times, 11/15/87, 4:llInformative this is used in the electronic specificationdocument for obligatory demonstrative reference to the referent ofa heading which is activated but not yet in focus, as in (24).Note that here an unstressed pronoun would not be possible.1The rows n-0, n-I and n-2+ refer to the distance between the demonstrativeexpression a d its antecedent.

IMPL ICAT IONS FOR ALGORIT I tMSThe previous sections Woposed constraints on demonstrativesand discussed their use in different genres.
This section outlinescomponents of a natural language system that would capture therelevant notions of shared familiarity, activation and form; andexplores possibilities for incorporating these into current dis~.course-processing al orithms.
1Shared familiarity.
At minimum, a computational rrtodel ofshared familiarity requires maintenance of a user discourse his-.tory in which a record is maintained of all entities referenced inconversations with a particular user.
Thus, for any entity in itsknowledge base, the natural anguage system knows whether/batentity has been discussed before (shared familiarity) or not(familiarity unknown).
Only in the former case can a definitedemonstrative expression be used.
The recognition of discourseunits (e.g.
speech acts of Allen 1983) and the aelations betweenthem, e.g.
conversational moves (Reichman 1985), rhetoricalpredicates (McKeown 1985, Mann and Thompson 1986) are alsoimportant in demonstrative r solution.
These require a so-phisticated user model which keeps a record of beliefs and inten-tions of discourse participants.
While such a model could be in-corporated into existing discourse structure frameworks (e.g.Grosz and Sidner 1986), no specific proposals to account forshared familiarity have yet been advanced (but see Sparck Jones1986).Activation.
An adequate model of activation must isolate thatsubset of shared entities which is activated at any given point inthe discourse.
This subset includes entities referenced in the im-mediately preceding sentence, ntities present in the immediatespatio-temporal context of the discourse, and beliefs and inten-tions relevant o the cmTent discourse segment.
Many curremdiscourse algorithms which function at the local level of  dis-course structure can be used to model activation due to the imme-diately preceding sentence.
For example, Haji~ov~i (1987) pointsoat that elements in McKeown's (1985) potential focus list can beequated with activated elements.
Similarly, in the currentcentering paradigm (Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein 1986, Brennan,Friedman and Pollard 1987) elements in the set of forward look-ing centers can also be considered activated.
At the global level,Sidner and Grosz (1986) describe a model of discourse structurewhich indicates currently activated beliefs and intentions at any?
given point in a discourse.In Focus.
Elements in focus are those which are most highlyactivated.
2 These always include at least the topic of the sen-tence, any high-level topics (including those not overtly repre-sented in the sentence), and under certain as yet poorly under-stood conditions, the referent of the linguistic focus.
In the cut'-.rent centering paradigm, the topic of the sentence isequated to thebackward looking center (ef.
Joshi and Weinstein 1981).
In thisl Kryk (1987) presents an algorithur for demo~lstrative int rpretation inPolish and English based on Sidner's 1983 algorithms.
Kryk's algorithm,bowever, does not appear to be explicit enough to serve as a basis forimplementation.
Moreover, some of the algorithm's predictions, forexample that the demonstrative that is never used fbr non-copresentextralinguistic reference whereas non-copresent this is u,':ed only forexla'alinguistic reference, are inaccurate.2Although our notion of activation is similar to Haji~ovlt (1987), it differsin that she considers the linguistic f~us to be more highly activated tha~t thetopic.
We feel that our assumptions about iegrces of activation me morecompatible wifli the fact, noted also by llaji~"ovfi, that topic maintains iir~activation longer than does the referents of the linguistic focus.
'2 2 Oparadigm nns~essed pronouns are viewed as preferring an ex-isting bacl~wards-lookhlg center as antecedent.
We have sug-gested that use of a demonstrative expression or stressed pronounsignals that the option to shift the backwards-looking center hasbeen selected over the otherwise-preferred option of continuingan existing backwards-looking center.
Brennan, Friedman andPollard (1987), in fact, mention in passing that stressed pronounsin oral discourse could be used to unambiguously signal one suchtype of cer~ter shift.
(cf.
Sgall (1984), who remarks that demon-stratives c~Jn be used to unambiguously specify reference to thelinguistic fi~cus of the irmnediately preceding sentence.
)Genre differences.
A final application of our constraints i inthe atea of discourse genre variation.
We have shown that boththe form and function of demonstrative expressions varies be-tween diffi;rent spoken and written discourse genres.
Our finalsuggestion is that these and other genre differences hould befurther explored, so that it will eventually be possible to designmaximally-efficient discourse-processing al orithms which dif-ferentially e, xploit such genre distinctions.7o REFERENCESAllen, James.
