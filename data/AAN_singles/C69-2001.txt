Level-Oriented Systems in Computational L inguist icsA new model for computational l inguistic perfor-m~,~ has recently been proposed by the Czechoslovakgroup of workers at Charles Unlverslty~ Prague~ underthe direction of Po Sgall (lp 2).
This model has Slg-ni f icant theoretlcal impllcations, since it offersan alternative to transformational ly based solutionsof the problems encountered in automatic syntacticanalysis t and consequently~ to the transformatlona~model itselfo In particular, the new model claims tocompete favorably with the transformational one ~>generative power and structural characterlzatio~; .Jsentences.Central to this model is the notion of a "multi- level"or "stratif ied" grammar.
The generation of a sentenceat the highest ("deepest") level of the grammar pro-ceeds by a set of context-free (CF) rules| the outputof these rules is then transduced to lower levels bya series of pushdown store automata.
The output of thefinal transduction is some "surface" representat ionof the sentence to be generated.Me?

CF-Preservatlon under TransductionThe whole system des?ribed in the preceding section issaid to be "weakly equivalent to a CF phrase structuregrammar" (1:148, 221).
This assertion is claimed toderive from theorems formulated by N. Chomsky and RoJ.
Evey (3; 4), which maintain that the output of apushdown store transducer (pdt) is equivalent to theset of CF languages (i:109; 2:2.2.5).However, the original theorems about this equivalenceconcerned pushdown store acceptors (pda), not trans-ducers (pdt as defined by Ginsburg (5:102)); for pdt(as used by Sgall and his group) t CF-preservation isknown not to obtain in general (5:104).The condition under which pdt will preserve CF langua-ges is stated by Ginsburg in Th.
3.5.1.
(5:104)'.given a pda M t a pdt S, L - T(M),S(L) is CF Iff M and S are associated, i.e.
S is ob-tained by adding outputs to M, the pda that accepts L.For the case of the Czechoslovak "battery" of trans-ducers, this condition could actually be fulfilled,although the authors never say so, explicitly?
I amMey 4referr ing to their extra condit ion on the system,as formulated in "the existence of inverse automatafor the single levels of the pushdown part \[of thegrammar, JM\] " (1:146).
Hence the impreciseness ofthe Czechoslovak proposal may amount to no more thana matter of incomplete formulation.In a recent article, however,- Ginsburg and Rose (6)have shown that the earl ier theorem on which theybased CF-preservatlon condit ions for pdt is false?
(And~ by the same tokenp so are the original theoremof Evey's (4:2?6?6) and an earl ler theorem by Ginsburgand Rose (7:3.2)).
According to the 1968 revised ver-sion of the latter ~heorem by Ginsburg and Rose (6:3?2~)~ CF~p~eserva~ion is made dependent upon an addl-tlona~ condit ion on the pdt~ n~m~y~ that o~ ~est~Ict-ing its ou~pu~ %o '~hese strings that are produced bythe device when it ends up in an accepting (oz final)state, In all other cases~ the language generated bythe pdt will not be equivalent to the set of CF lan-guages, but simply constitute a ~ecurs lvely enumer -ab le  se%~Mey 53.
Practical Consequences for the Prague SystemFor the case under consideration, the new insight re-ferred to in the preceding section has two slgnlfl-cant consequences:first, the worries of the Czechoslovak group to ensureCF preservation may well have been in vainf unlessthe new condition can be incorporated into their sys-temo Otherwiset a device that is practically equlva-lent to a Turlng machine is not very exciting to workwith in computatlonal linguistic theory or its imple-mentation.Second~ one of the advantages inherent in the use ofCF-preservlng transducers is the guaranteed existenceof a whole bevy of working recognition routines (e.g.,the Cocke-Roblnson algorithm, the parser developedby Kay I or the predictive analyzer by Kuno, etc.
)This advantage becomes illusory if the pdt batteryproduces a recursively enumerable languaget ioe.
onethat cannot be guaranteed to be recognized by a CF-recognition routine.If we think of the Czechoslovak system as part of aMey 6machine translation proposal, where the route fromsource to "Interl lngua" consists of essential ly thesame flow (but in the opposite direction) as thatfrom "interl lngua" to target language, it appearsthat the consequences of an incorporation of theGinsburg-Rose adjustment are far-reaching.
Such anincorporation could take place in two ways: eitherone could check the output of a part icu lar  (~-th)device, transducing from a higher (~-th) to a lower(~ - lth) level, or from a lower (~-th) to a higher(~ ?
lth) level~ to see whether or not this outputcorresponds to an accepting state (where "higher"and'~oweE" are understood to refer to deeper andmore superficial structures respectively); oft al-ternatively, a built- ln checking device could preventoutput from being generated unless the transducerreached an accepting state after reading the inputstring.
So far t Sgall and his group have not sugges-ted ways to handle this problem.Quite another matter is that the Prague group's p?o-posal to let the output of the ~- th  de,ice be ?
p ro -per  s~bset of the input of the ~ + Ith~ ~ - IthMey 7transducer respectively, does not seem to be fruitful,or even feasibleo Naturallyp the first question thatarises is: what about the remaining input, where doesit all come from?
It is certainly true, as the authorsremark (2:2o2o5)~ that "the output language of thewhole descr ipt ion is not necessar i ly  context-free"oAS shown above, it simply never is under the givencondit ions.
Hence the reason given in the rest of thequote is trivial: "since ?..
it is only a proper sub-aet of the context- free languages of the last pushdowntransducer" (ibld.
)o While it is always possible totame a prope~ subset of a CF language and obtain alanguage tha% i~ not C2~ or maybe not even reguiar~that c leaxly i~ not the point here.
The authors in~ndtheir output language to be CF~ for reasons l lk~ theones ment ioned above?
As long as it can be shown (asI have done here) that the system in no case is (evenweakly) equivalent to a CF grammar~ the quest ion ofthe restr ict ions on the input to the subsequent trans-ducers is t of course, i rrelevant to the CF characterof the system as a whole.Mey 84.
Some theoretical implicationsThe proponents  o f  the Prague model have repeated lyasserted that their system has certain advantagesover other models of linguistic performance and, inparticular t that their grammar is superior (or atleast equivalent) to transformational grammar.The claim that the level-based model is superior toothers because of easy CF-recognitlon has been.
dispro-ved in the preceding sections.
Another claim, that ofgreater naturalness inherent in the level-orlentedmodel, is also often made (sometimes implicitly byreference to the model's stance in tlme-honored lin-guistic tradition).
It should be observed t however~that such a claim does not concern the formal charac-ter of any system.
As Chomsky has pointed out (in hisdiscussion of Fillmore's case theory (8:14-16)) I itis vacuous to discuss different formal systems interms of which is the more "direct" representationof natural language; unless a formal system is inter-preted 0 it slmply cannot be compared to another onefor "~Lrectneee" of expression.But how about transformational grammar itself withMey 9respect to sentence recognit ion?
It has been kno~for a long time that there is no way of establ lshinga universal automatic recognit ion procedure for at r~s format lona l  grammar that is not in some waysrestr icted?
This was precisely the Prague group'smot ivat ion for proposing their system as a (superior)a l ternat lve to TGo Now that their clalms have beende-substant lated on theoretlcal grounds, it may seeml ike a meagre consolat ion to the Prague ~oup that TGitself  is in the same boat, theoret ical ly speaking.In an important recent study~ Peters and R i tch le  havedemonstrated that a context-sensltlve (CS) basedtransformational  grammar~ unless restr icted in somerespecta~ generates a recurs lvely enumerable language~and conversely, for any recurslvely enumerable languagethere is a CS based TG that will generate it (9:4.1).As the authors point out (ibido:33), it is imperativeto set out and f ind condit ions under which a TG willgenerate only recurslve languages.
One such condit ionwould be to restr ict  the base of a TG to be CF; however tt-nls will sti l l  not guarantee recurslv l ty (9:4.2)?This is preclsely the problem that the CzechoslovakIworkers will have to solve in o rder  to make thelr systemvlable and to val ldate their claims.Mey 10References(I) Po Sgall, Generativn~ Po_o~Jazvka  a ~esk~ Dek~inace,Prague 1967.
