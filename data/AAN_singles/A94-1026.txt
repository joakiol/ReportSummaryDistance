jpAbstractJapanese texts frequently suffer from thehomophone errors caused by the KANA-KANJIconversion eeded to input the text.
It is critical,therefore, for Japanese revision support systemsto detect and to correct homophone errors.
Thispaper proposes a method for detecting andcorrecting Japanese homophone errors incompound nouns.
This method can not only detectJapanese homophone errors in compound nouns,but also can find the correct candidates for thedetected errors automatically.
Finding the correctcandidates i one superiority of this method overexisting methods.
The basic idea of this methodis that a compound noun component places omerestrictions on the semantic ategories of theadjoining words.
The method accuratelydetermines that a homophone is misused in acompound noun if one or both of its neighbors inot a member of the semantic set defined by thehomophone.
Also, the method successfullyindicates the correct candidates for the detectedhomophone errors.1 IntroductionWe have been using morphological nalysis to developREVISE, a revision support system that corrects Japaneseinput errors (Ikehara, Yasuda, Shimazaki, and Takagi,1987; Ohara, Takagi, Hayashi, and Takeishi, 1991).REVISE can detect and correct various types of errors,such as character deletion, character insertion and somegrammatical errors, using knowledge bases that describethe characteristics of each error type (see figure 1).Homophone errors are one of the error types that can bedetected and corrected in REVISE.Most Japanese texts are made with Japanese wordprocessors.
As Japanese texts consist of phonograms,KANA, and ideograms, KANJI, lapanese word processorsalways use KANA-KANJI conversion in which KANAsequences (i.e.
readings) input through the key board areconverted into KANA-KANJI sequences.
Therefore,Japanese texts suffer from homophone errors caused byerroneous KANA-KANJI conversion.
A homophone erroroccurs when a KANA sequence is converted into thewrong word which has the same KANA sequence (i.e.the same reading).
Therefore, detecting and correctinghomophone errors is an important topic.Japanese sentencewire errorsMorphglogiealAn~ysls\[ Error Detection ~?
~~nowKnowl~~\[Error Correction \[~'- ' --~Lor Variofis Errors J\[,Display\[User chooses correct candidateFigure 1: Processing flow of REVISE.Previous research into detecting homophone rrorswith revision supportsystems used two approaches;(a) using correct-wrong word pairs (Kuga, 1986),Co) using KWIC (Key Word In Context) lists (Fukushima,Ohtake, Ohyama, and Shutoh, 1986; Suzuki andTakeda, 1989).Previous research into correct homophone selection inKANA-KANJI conversion used the following twomethods;(c) using collocation of words (Nakano, 1982; Tanaka,Mizutani, and Yoshida, 1984; Makino and Kizawa,1981).
(d) using case frame grammar (Oshima, Abe, Yuura, andTakeichi, 1986).Method (a) has a drawback in that only pre-defined wrongwords in correct-wrong word pairs are detected.
Method(b) only indicates which words are in the KWIC list.Therefore, method (b) cannot automatically detect if theword is misused.
Method (c) demands the creation of ahuge dictionary which must describe all possible wordcollocations.
Method (d) can select he correct homophoneby using the semantic restriction between a verb and itscases based on case frame grammar.
It is difficult,however, to use method (d) for detecting the homophone156errors in compound nouns because it mainly depends onJOSHI (i.e.
Japanese postpositions) which are absent incompound nouns.
Furthermore, it is difficult, if notimpossible, for existing methods, (a)~(d), to correcthomophone errors.This paper describes a method for detecting andcorrecting homophone errors in compound nouns usedin REVISE.
The idea underlying this method is that acompound noun component semantically restricts thesemantic ategories of adjoining words.
Using semanticcategories reduces dictionary size; moreover, this methodneeds no syntactic information such as case frames.
Msodescribed are the experimental results made to certifythe validity of this method.2 Definition of key termsKey terms used in this paper are defined as follows:?
Japanese compound noun;A noun that consists of several nouns, none of whichhave JOSHI (i.e.
Japanese postpositions).?
Homophone;A word that sounds the same as another but has differentspelling (i.e.
KANJI sequence) and meaning.?
Homophone error;An error that occurs when a KANA sequence isconverted into the wrong word which has the sameKANA sequence (i.e.
the same reading) as the correctone.?
Semantic ategory;A class for dividing nouns themselves into conceptsaccording to their meaning.
For example, both "~t .~.'.
"and "~/'~,."
belong to the same semantic ategory\[nature\].3 A variety of homophone rrorsIt is necessary to use semantic information, such as thesemantic restriction between words in a sentence, tohandlehomophone errors.
We note that it is difficult, if may notimpossible, to handle all homophone errors uniformly.For example, within a compound noun, the semanticrestriction is mainly seen between adjacent words.
Thecase frame semantic restriction encompasses the wholesentence.
Therefore, the discussion of this paper focuseson the detection and correction of homophone errors incompound nouns.4 A method for handling homophoneerrorsTanaka and Yoshida (1987) pointed out that thecollocation of words in compound nouns is restrictedsemantically.
This means that the existence of compoundnoun component "X" semantically restricts the set ofwords that can appear next to "X".
In order to describethis set, we use semantic ategories instead of the wordsthemselves to significantly reduce dictionary size.Namely, if a word is to be accepted as an immediateneighbor of "X", its semantic ategory must be withinthe set defined by "X".Compound nounNo~ ' -~es  o ..at"Indicate correct candidates I~l~"for the error \]\] Display candidates II User Selection \]%endFigure 2: Flow diagram of handling homophone errors.Figure 2 shows the flow diagram of handling homophoneerrors.
Handling consists of two processes: error detectionand error correction.
In the error correction process, thecorrect candidates for detected homophone errors can beindicated to the user automatically.
The user is responsiblefor the final selection of the correct homophone fromamong the indicated candidates.
Semantic restrictions,which are used in both processes, are described in asemantic restriction dictionary using semantic ategories.4.1 Detecting homophone rrors in compoundnounsThe compound noun that includes only one homophone,h i, is represented as;wp hiw?,where up, Wo are words that have no homophones.
Theset of words with the same reading as h i isH= { hl, h 2, "", hl, "", hm }.PS i is the set of semantic ategories that can appearimmediately before homophone h i. NS i is the set ofsemantic ategories that can appear immediately after h i.Here, we assume that each semantic restriction foreach word in set H is exclusive.
That is, for every i, j,esi n P% =NS i {q NSj = #, --- (1)iq=j, i,j = 1 ,2 , ' " ,m.In the compound noun wp h i w n, when h i is the correcthomophone, the semantic ategories of wp and w, satisfythe semantic restrictions of h,, i.e.,157the semantic category ofwp e PS~ andthe semantic category of w, e NS ~ ".
(2)On the other hand, when h i is the wrong homophone,semantic ategories of wp and w, do not satisfy thesemantic restriction for h i, i.e., from (1) and (2);the semantic category ofwp 4E PS i and/orthe semantic category of w. ~ NS ~ -'- (3)Therefore, we can detect homophone errors in compoundnouns based on (2) and (3).4.2 Insufficient semantic discriminationIt is possible that set H contains two or more wordswhose PSs and/or NSs overlap, such that the semanticsets do not yield sufficient discrimination performance.Namely, several semantic restrictions for words in set Hdo not satisfy formula (1), i.e., for the semantic categoriesof several words in set H,PSi fq PSi 4: 4,NS i CI NS i 4: 4, "'" (4)iIn this case, semantic ategories which do not belong toPS i CI PS i or NS t CI NS i can also be used for detectinghomophone errors based on (2) and/or (3).
The wordswith semantic ategories belonging to PS i N PS i or NS~CI NSi, however, fail to distinguish i and h becausesuch categories satisfy both semantic restrictions in termsof h i and h i .It is very difficult to construct a semantic ategorysystem that would satisfy formula (1) for all words.Therefore, in REVISE, when a word whose semanticcategories belong to PS i N PS i or NS i N NS i adjoin h~or h i in compound nouns, h i or h i is detected as ahomophone rror.
This may wrongly indicate correcthomophones a  errors but no error will be missed.
Thisis a basic requirement ofany text revision support systemand/or any text proofreading system.4.3 Correct ing homophone errors incompound nounsThe correct homophone in a compound noun should satisfythe semantic restrictions established by its adjoiningwords.
The semantic ategory for the adjoining word ofthe homophone error should be included in the sets ofsemantic categories that can appear immediatelybefore/after the correct homophone.
Namely, it is thecorrect candidates for the detected homophone error thatsatisfy formula (2) and that have the same KANAsequence (i.e.
the same reading) as the error.
When thesemantic ategory sets of homophones partially overlapand the category of the adjoining word falls into theoverlap region, the homophone is detected as erroneouseven if it is correct, as described above in 4.2.
In thiscase, the detected homophone itself is 'also indicated asone of the correct candidates if it satisfies formula (2).To indicate only candidates which satisfy formula (2)leads us to a shortened correction process because thecorrect homophone will be included in the candidates.4.4 Semantic restriction dictionaryThe semantic restriction dictionary describes whichsemantic ategories can adjoin, either before or after,each homophone.
Figure 3 shows the format of thesemantic restriction dictionary.
A record consists of thefollowing four items;?
homophone r ading: the semantic restriction dictionaryis retrieved by the homophone reading in the errorcorrection process, to find the correct candidates forthe detected homophone error.?
KANJI homophone spelling: the dictionary is retrievedby the KANJI homophone spelling in the error detectionprocess, to determine whether the homophone ismisused in the compound noun or not.?
information whether semantic restrictions in this recordapply to the preceding or following word.?
semantic restrictions: this is the set of semanticcategories that can adjoin the homophone.
Semanticcategories which are included in two or more sets ofthe homophones are marked as to show insufficientsemantic discrimination.Ways of using the semantic restriction dictionary inboth processes, error detection and error correction, willbe described using examples in the next section.preceding I reading spelling or semantic restrictionsfollowingFigure 3: The format of the semantic restriction dictionary.4.5 Examples  of  handling homophone r ro rsAn example of detecting homophone rrors in thecompound noun "~1.~ ' ,~" ,  which includes thehomophone "~-~-(chemistry)" is shown in figure 4.

As shown in figure4, semantic ategory \[nature\] is not included in the setthat represents the semantic restriction on the possibleprior neighbors of "'\[~-~-".
Therefore, "~j~:" is detectedas a homophone error in the compound noun "~ ~\ [~-~" based on formula (3).

Therefore,"~"  in the compound noun "SE~d~ " is detected asthe error, and the correction process is invoked.

According to formulae (2) and (3), only "g\]\[~" and"-~-~" are indicated as correct candidates.
Although thecorrect homophone is detected as the error, that he correcthomophone (the original homophone) will be a candidateshortens the correction process.5 ExperimentsThe validity of this method was confirmed withexperiments in detecting and correcting homophoneerrors.
We assumed that he input compound nouns werealready segmented into component words and that heirreading and semantic categories were already added.Table 1: Homophones u ed in experiments.readingukikaikiseikyoukoukyousoukyoudogenkakougaikougyoukoutaikounaikouhyou\[ saiteishitenshougakushoukyakui shomeijiteni senshintaikouchikateigakudenkitoshinaizouI nihonninkihanmenfuyoubunhokenspellingM~~:Fa ~,~ ~,~m~~T ~NN gA~ ~N95.1 Experimental data?

The semantic ategory system:The semantic ategory system used in the experimentswas constructed by referring to BUNRUI-GOI-HYOedited by the National Language Research Institute(1964) and RUIGO-SHIN-JITEN written by Ono andHamanishi (1981), which are the most famous emanticcategory systems for the Japanese language.
Thesemantic system has about 200 nodes and covers about35,000 words.?
The semantic restriction dictionary:Compound nouns including all homophones in table 1,were collected from newspaper a ticles over a 90 dayperiod, and the semantic restriction dictionary was madebased on the semantic restrictions between thehomophones and the adjoining words in compoundnouns.5.3 Exper imenta l  resultsGenerally speaking, the performance ofan error detectionmethod can be measured by two indices: the detectionrate indicates the percentage oferrors correctly determinedand the misdetection rate indicates the percentage ofcorrect words that are erroneously detected as errors.The detection rate is defined as;Detection rate = the number of errors detected actual number ofwrong compounds in the sample.160The misdetection rate is defined as;Misdetection rate=the number ofhomophones misdetectedactual number ofcorrect compounds in the sample.The experimental results are shown in table 3.
Thedetection rate is over 95%.
This value is much higherthan the 48.9% rate previously reported (Suzuki andTakeda, 1989).
On the other hand, the misdetection rateis less than 30%.
This value shows that the proposedmethod determined that over 70% of the correcthomophones in compound nouns were correct.
This meansthat the confirmation process can be significantlyshortened because fewer correct compounds are presentedfor confirmation.
Moreover, in the correction process,for more than 80% of detected errors, the correcthomophone was a candidate.
These results show thatthis method can detect and correct homophone errors incompound nouns successfully.Table 3: Experimental results.misdetection rate \[%\] detection rate \[%\]:lata set 1 27.1 - - -  -data set 2 28.3clata set 3 ' - -  ' 96.3data set 4 - -  - 97.15.4 DiscussionWe analyzed the experimental results and determinedthat misdetection is caused by two factors;(a) imperfect semantic restriction dictionary,Co) semantic ategories that belong to sets that can adjoinwords having the same reading.The number of compound nouns used to make the semanticrestriction dictionary was different for each word reading.When the number of compound nouns used to constructthe dictionary is large enough, misdetection caused byfactor (a) will be minimized.
Factor (b) can be offset byoptimizing the semantic ategory system to improvesemantic discrimination.
This problem will be researchedin the future.6 ConclusionThis paper has described a method for detecting andcorrecting Japanese homophone rrors in compoundnouns used in a revision support system for Japanesetexts; REVISE.
The underlying concept of this methodis that a compound noun component can restrict he setof semantic ategories of words that can adjoin thecomponent.
The method accurately determines that ahomophone is misused in a compound noun if one orboth of its neighbors is not a member of the set definedby the homophone.
Also, the method successfullyindicates the correct candidates for the detectedhomophone errors automatically.
Experiments indicatethat he detection rate is over 95% and that the misdetectionrate is less than 30%.
These results conf'mn the validityof this method in detecting and correcting Japanesehomophone errors in compound nouns.References:Fukushima, Toshikazu; Ohtake, Akiko; Ohyama, Yutaka;and Shutoh, Tomoki (1986).
