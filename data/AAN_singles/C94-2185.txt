Fordousha with ha (Table 2), compared with Table 1,very l>w referents are located in the same sentence,and most of the referents are in the subject position.For both occurrences of dousha, a considerable num-ber of the referellts appear two or more sentelice8beR)re, and a few of them show up even two or threeparagraphs before.3 THREE HEURIST IC  METHODSTESTED3.1 Three  Heur i s t i c  MethodsOile simple and two heuristic iilethods to fill(I the rcl Lerents of dousha are described below.
The lirst, thesimple method, is to take the closest COml/any name,(the one which appears most recently before dousha),as its referent (SilnI)le C losest  Method  or SCM).It is used ill this paper to indicate the t)~Lseline pcr-lbrmance tbr reference resolution of dousha.The second method is a modified Siml)le ClosestMethod for dousha with ca.
It is basically the sameas SCM except hat:?
i f  there is (tile or there, conlpany l iaine hi thesairie seiltellce before the dousha, take |.lie clos-est COllipally nanw.
as the referent.?
if there is a conipany llaille inllnediately fol-lowed by ha, ca, deha, or niyorulo somewherebel5re dousDa, use the closest such companyname as the referent.?
if the previous sentence nds with a cOral)anyll;_~llle, thus l )utt ing aii enlphasis on the COlll-pal ly liaine, make it the rcl\]2relit.?
if there is a pattern "COli lpai ly l iame lie h l l l l ia l il ialI le t i t le.

(equivalent to <'title hi i l l la i i  l ialnoof cOUll)any elaine..." in I'\]nglish) in the prove-Oils SOlltellce, then iiso the COllipaliy n~iliie astim reforelit.
Typ ica l  tit les are sh.achou (presi-dent) alld kaichou (Chairinan uP I/oard).The theM heuristic method is used t~r dousha with hacases.
It is also based on SCM except the followingpoints:?
if there is a company name innnediately tbLlowed by ha, ga, deha, or uiyoruto somewhere.before dousha, use the closest such colnl)anyname as the referent.
* if the previous sentence nds with a companyname, thus putting an eniphasis Oil the coin-liany nalne, make it the reli'~rent.?
if there is a pattern "coral)any nanie no humanname title..." (equivalent to "title human nameof company name..." in English) in the prove-mils seiltelice~ theil /ise the cowilialiy Ilanie asthe refi;rent.The third method is in fact a set of the secondmethod, and both of them use semantic information(i.e.
company name, human name., title), syntacticpatterns (i.e.
where a conll)any name, a human name,or a title appears in a sentence) and several specificlexical items which come immediately after tim com-pany Ilallies.3.2  Test  Resu l tsThe three lnethods haw'.
heen tested on the develop-merit data from which the lnethods were producedand on the set.
of unseen test data.3.2.1 Aga ins t  the  dew; lo lmient  dataAs mentioned in section two, there are 42 cases ofdousha with ga and 66 cases of dousha with ha.For the dousha with ga rases, the Simple Clos-est Method identifie.s the referents 67% correctly (27correct out of 42), and the second inethod does so90% (38 out of 42) correctly.
,qCM misses a numberof referents whMi appear iii previous entences, andmost of those which appear two or inore sentelicespreviously.For the cases of dousha with ha, SCM identitiesthe referents correctly only 52% (34 correct out of66), however, the third heuristic method correctlyideiltilies 94% (62 out of 66).3.2.2 Aga ins t  the  test; dataThe test data was taken front Japanese newspaperarticles on micro-electronics.
There are 1078 arti--c.les, and 51 cases of dousha with ga and 250 cases ofdousha with ha.
The test has been conducted againstthe.
all get cases (51 of them) and the first t O0 Bet cases.For the dousha with ga cases, the Simple Clos-est Method identifies the referents 80% correctly (4 Icorrect out of 51), and the second method does so96% (49 out of 51) correctly.For the c~Lses of dousha with ha, SCM identifiesthe referents correctly only 83% (83 correct out of100), however, tl,e third heuristic method correctlyide.ntifies 96% (96 out of 100).The following table, Table 3, shows the summaryof the test.

This means that partial semantic parsing(in which key semantic information such as companyname, human name, and title is marked) is snfli-cient for reference resolution of important referentialexpressions such as dousha in Japanese.
Moreover,since the two modified methods are simple, they willbe easily implemented by computationally inexpen-sive finite-state pattern matchers (Hobbs el aL 1992;Cowie ct al.
1993).
Therefore, they will be suitablefor large scale text processing (Jaeobs 1992; Chinchorel al.
1993).One important point to realize is that the sec-ond and third methods, although they are simple toimplement, achieve something that is rather compli-cated and may be computatlonally expensive other-wise.
For example, in order to find the correct refer-ent of a given dousha, you may have to skip one entireparagraph and find the referent wo paragraphs be-fore, or you may have to choose the right companyname from several possible company names which ap-pear before the given dousha.
The modified methodsdo this correctly most of the time without worryingabout constructing sometimes complicated syntacticstructures of the sentences in the search window forthe possible referent.Another important point is that the modifiedmethods make good use of post-nominal particles,especially ha and ga. For example, if the referent islocated two sentences or more before, then the ref-erent (the company name) comes with ha ahnost allthe time (35 out of 38 such cases for both dousha).It seems that if tile referent of the dousha in consid-eration is more than a certain distance before, twosentences in this case, then tile referent is markedwith ha most of the time.
Kitani also uses this haor ga marked company names as key information ihis reference resolution algorithm for dousha (Kitani1994).5 CONCLUSIONThe locations and contexts of tile referents of doushain Japanese Joint-Venture articles are determined byhand.
Three henristic methods are proposed andtested.
The methods which use semantic informa-tion in the text and its patterns how high accuracyin finding the referents (96% for dousha with ga and96% for dousha with ha for the unseen test data).
Thehigh success rates snggest hat a semantic pattern-matching approach is not only a valid method butalso an ef\[icicnt method for reference resolution inthe newspaper article domains.
Since the Japaneselanguage ishighly case-inflected, case (particle) infofmation is used effectively in these methods for refer-ence resolution.
-How much one can do with semanticpattern matching for reference resolution of similarexpressions such as "the company" or "tile Japanesecompany" in English newspaper articles is a topic forfllture research.6 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTI would like to thank tile Tipster project group at theCRL for their inspiration and suggestions.
