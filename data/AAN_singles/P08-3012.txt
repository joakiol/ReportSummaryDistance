Prelim-inary experimental result on the 2007 Com-putational Medicine Challenge data shows ahierarchical TC system has achieved a micro-averaged F1 value of 86.6, which is compara-ble to the performance of state-of-the-art flatclassification systems.1 IntroductionThe task of assigning meaningful categories to freetext has attracted researchers in the Natural Lan-guage Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval(IR) field for more than 10 years.
However, it hasonly recently emerged as a hot topic in the clinicaldomain where categories to be assigned are orga-nized in taxonomies which cover common medicalconcepts and link them together in hierarchies.
Thispaper evaluates the effectiveness of adopting a hi-erarchical text categorization approach to the 2007Computational Medicine Challenge which aims toassign appropriate ICD-9-CM codes to free text ra-diology reports.
(Pestian et al, 2007)The ICD-9-CM 1, which stands for InternationalClassification of Diseases, 9th Revision, ClinicalModification, is an international standard which isused for classifying common medical concepts, suchas diseases, symptoms and signs, by hospitals, insur-ance companies, and other health organizations.
The2007 Computational Medicine Challenge was set in1see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd9.htma billing scenario in which hospitals claim reim-bursement from health insurance companies basedon the ICD-9-CM codes assigned to each patientcase.
The competition has successfully attracted 44submissions with a mean micro-averaged F1 perfor-mance of 76.70.
(Pestian et al, 2007)To the best of our knowledge, the systems re-ported were all adopting a flat classification ap-proach in which a dedicated classifier has been builtfor every targeted ICD-9-CM code.
Each classifiermakes a binary decision of True or False accordingto whether or not a clinical note should be assignedwith the targeted ICD-9-CM code.
An incomingclinical note has to be tested against all the classi-fiers before a final coding decision can be made.
Theresponse time of a flat approach therefore grows lin-early with the number of categories in the taxonomy.Moreover, low-frequency ICD-9-CM codes sufferthe data imbalance problem in which positive train-ing instances are overwhelmed by negative ones.A hierarchical system takes into account relation-ships among categories.
Classifiers are assignedto both leaf and internal nodes of a taxonomy andtraining instances are distributed among these nodes.When a test instance comes in, a coding decision ismade by generating all possible paths (start from theroot node of the taxonomy) where classifiers alongpath return favorable decisions.
In other words, anode is visited only if the classifier assigned to itsparent returns a True decision.
This strategy signif-icantly reduces the average number of classifiers tobe used in the test stage when the taxonomy is verylarge.
(Liu et al, 2005; Yang et al, 2003)672 Related WorksMost top systems in the 2007 ComputationalMedicine Challenge have benefited from incorpo-rating domain knowledge of free-text clinical notes,such as negation, synonymy, and hypernymy, ei-ther as hand-crafted rules in a symbolic approach,or as carefully engineered features in a machine-learning component.
(Goldstein et al, 2007; Farkasand Szarvas, 2007; Crammer et al, 2007; Aronsonet al, 2007; Patrick et al, 2007)Aronson et al (2007) used a variant of NationalLibrary of Medicine Medical Text Indexer (MTI)which was originally developed for discoveringMedical Subject Headings (MeSH) 2 terms for in-dexing biomedical citations and articles.
The outputof MTI was converted into ICD-9-CM codes by ap-plying different approaches of mapping discoveredUnified Medical Language System (UMLS) 3 con-cepts into ICD-9-CM codes, such as using synonymand built-in mapping relations in UMLS Metathe-saurus.
This approach can easily adapt to any sub-domain of the UMLS Metathesaurus since it onlyrequires very little examples for tuning purposes.However, MTI performed slightly behind an SVMsystem with only bag-of-words features, which sug-gests the difficulty of optimizing a general purposesystem without any statistical learning on the tar-geted corpus.
By stacking MTI, SVM, KNN and asimple pattern matching system together, a final F1score of 85 was reported on the official test set.Farkas and Szarvas (2007) automatically translatedefinitions of the ICD-9-CM into rules of a sym-bolic system.
Decision tree was then used to modelthe disagreement between the prediction of the sys-tem and the gold-standard annotation of the trainingdata set.
This has improved the performance of thesystem to a F1 value of 89.
Goldstein et al (2007)also reported that a rule-based system enhanced bynegation, synonymy, and uncertainty information,has outperformed machine learning models whichonly use n-gram features.
The rules were manuallytuned for every ICD-9-CM code found in the chal-lenge training data set and therefore suffer the scal-ing up problem.On the other hand, researchers tried to encode do-2http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/3http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Total radiology records 1,954Total tokens 51,940Total ICD-9-Codes 45Total code instances 2,423Table 1: Statistics of the data setmain knowledge into machine learning systems bydeveloping more sophisticated feature types.
Patricket al (2007) developed a variety of new feature typesto model human coder?s expertise, such as negationand code overlaps.
Different combination of fea-ture types were tested for each individual ICD-9-CMcode and the best combination was used in the finalsystem.
Crammer et al (2007) also used a rich fea-ture set in their MIRA system which is an onlinelearning algorithm.Figure 1: Distribution of ICD-9-CM codes in the chal-lenge data set.3 The CorpusThe corpus used in this study is the official dataset of the 2007 Computational Medicine Challenge.The challenge corpus consists of 1,954 radiology re-ports from the Cincinnati Children?s Hospital Med-ical Center and was divided into a training set with978 records, and a test set with 976 records.
Thestatistics of the corpus is shown in Table 1.Each radiology record in the corpus has two sec-tions: ?Clinical History?
which is provided by anordering physician before a radiological procedure,and ?Impression?
which is reported by a radiologistafter the procedure.
A typical radiology report isshown below:68786Symptoms involving respiratory systemand other chest symptoms(0/698)786.0Dyspnea and respiratory abnormalities(0/98)786.1Stridor(0/0)786.2Cough(529/529)786.5Chest pain(69/71)786.05Shortness of breath(6/6)786.07Wheezing(85/85)786.09Other(7/7)786.59Other(2/2)Figure 2: A part of the ICD-9-CM taxonomy: the tree covers symptoms involving respiratory system and other chestsymptoms.
There are two figures shown in each node: the first figure is the number of positive instances assigned tothe current node, and the next figure shows the number of all the instances in its subtree.Clinical historyPersistent cough, no fever.ImpressionRetained secretions vs atelectasis in theright lower lobe.
No infiltrates to supportpneumoniaThree different institutions were invited to assignICD-9-CM codes to the corpus.
The majority codewith at least two votes from the three annotators wasconsidered as the gold-standard code for the record.Moreover, a clinical record can be assigned withmultiple ICD-9-CM codes at a time.The general guideline of assigning ICD-9-CMcodes includes two important rules:?
If there is a definite diagnosis in text, thediagnosis should be coded and all symptomand sign codes should be ignored.?
If the diagnosis is undecided, or there is nodiagnosis found, the symptoms and signsshould be coded rather than the uncertaindiagnosis.According to the guideline, the above radiologyrecord should be assigned with only a ?Cough?
codebecause ?Atelectasis?
and ?Pneumonia?
are not cer-tain, and ?Fever?
has been negated.There are 45 ICD-9-CM codes found in the cor-pus and their distribution is imbalanced.
Figure 1shows a pie chart of three types of the ICD-9-CMcodes found in the corpus and their accumulated cat-egory frequencies.
The 20 low-frequency (less than10 occurrences) codes account for only 3% of the to-tal code occurrence in the challenge data set.
Thereare 19 codes with a frequency between 10 and 100and altogether they account for 34% total code oc-currence.
Finally, the most frequent six codes ac-count for over 60% of total code instances.4 Hierarchical Text CategorizationFrameworkIn a hierarchical text categorization system, cate-gories are linked together and classifiers are as-signed to each node in the taxonomy.
In the trainingstage, instances are distributed to their correspond-ing nodes.
For instance, Figure 2 shows a populatedsubtree of ICD-9-CM code ?786?
which covers con-cepts involving respiratory system and other chestsymptoms.
Nodes in grey box such as 786.2 and786.5 are among 45 gold-standard codes found inthe challenge data set.
Nodes in white box such as786 and 786.0 are internal nodes which have non-69empty subtrees.
For instance, the numbers (0, 698)of ?786?
suggest that the node is assigned with zeroinstances for training while there are 698 positiveinstances assigned to nodes in its subtree.
The node?786.1?
is in dotted box because there is no instanceassigned to it, nor any of its subtrees.
In the ex-periment, all nodes (such as ?786.1?)
with empty in-stance in its subtree were removed from the trainingand testing stage.When training a classifier for a node A in the tree,all the instances in the subtree rooted in the parent ofA become the only source of training instances.
Forinstance, code ?786.0?
in Figure 2 uses all the 698 in-stances rooted in node ?786?
as the full training dataset.
The 98 instances rooted in node ?786.0?
itselfare the positive instances while the remaining 600instances in the tree as the negative ones.
This hier-archical approach of distributing training instancescan reduce the size of training data set for most clas-sifiers and minimize the data imbalance problem forlow-frequency codes in the taxonomy.In the test stage, the system starts from the root ofthe ICD-9-CM taxonomy and evaluates an incomingclinical note against classifiers assigned to its chil-dren nodes.
The system will then visit every childnode which returns a positive classification result.The process repeats recursively until a possible pathends by reaching a node that returns a negative clas-sification result.
This strategy enables the sytem toassign multiple codes to a clinical note by visitingdifferent paths in the ICD-9-CM taxonomy simulta-neously.5 Methods and Experiments5.1 Experiment SettingsIn this study, Support Vector Machines (SVM) wasused for both flat and hierarchical text categoriza-tion.
The LibSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001) packagewas used with a linear kernel.5.1.1 Hierarchical TCA tree of ICD-9-CM taxonomy was constructedby enquiring the UMLS Metathesaurus.
Duringeach iteration of 10-fold cross-validation experi-ment, the training instances were assigned to theICD-9-CM tree and all nodes assigned with zerotraining instance in its subtree were removed fromthe tree.
This ended with an ICD-9-CM tree witharound 100 nodes for each training and test iteration.Nodes in the tree were uniquely identified bytheir concept id (CUI) found in the UMLS Metathe-saurus.
However, two ICD-9-CM codes (?599.0?and ?V13.02?)
were found to share the same CUI inthe UMLS Metathesaurus.
As a result, 44 uniqueUMLS CUIs were used as the gold-standard codesin the experiment for the original 45 ICD-9-CMcodes.In the test stage, the hierarchical system returnsthe terminal nodes of the predicted path.
Moreover,if the terminal ends in an internal code which is notone of the 44 gold-standard UMLS CUI found in thetraining corpus, the system should ignore the wholepath.5.1.2 Flat TCIn a flat text categorization setting, 44 classifierswere created for each UMLS Metathesaurus CUIfound in the corpus.
Each classifier makes a binarydecision of ?Yes?
or ?No?
to a clinical record accord-ing to whether or not it should be assigned with thecurrent code.5.2 PreprocessingThe corpus was first submitted to the GENIA tag-ger (Tsuruoka et al, 2005) for part-of-speech tag-ging and shallow syntactic analysis.
The result wasused by the negation finding module and all the iden-tified negated terms were removed from the corpus.The cleaned text was used by the MetaMap (Aron-son, 2001) for identifying possible medical conceptsin text.
The MetaMap software is configured to re-turn only concepts of ICD-9-CM and SNOMED CTwhich is another comprehensive medical ontologywidely used for mapping concepts in free-text clini-cal notes.5.3 EvaluationThe main evaluation metric used in the experimentis the micro-averaged F1 which is defined as the har-monic mean between Precision and Recall:F1 =2 ?
Precision ?
RecallPrecision + Recallwhere70Precision =?i TP (Codei)?i TP (Codei) +?i FP (Codei)Recall =?i TP (Codei)?i TP (Codei) +?i FN(Codei)In the above equation, TP (Codei), FP (Codei),and FN(Codei) are the numbers of true posi-tives, false positives, and false negatvies for the ithcode.
The micro-averaged F1 considers every sin-gle coding decision equally important and is there-fore dominant by the performance on frequent codesin data.
Moreover, a hierarchical micro-averagedF (hierarchical)1 is also introduced by adding all an-cestors of the current gold-standard code into cal-culation.
The F (hierarchical)1 value helps to evaluatehow accurate a system predicts in terms of the gold-standard path in the ICD-9-CM tree.5.4 FeaturesThe feature set is descibed in Table 2.?
Bag-of-wordsBoth unigram (F1) and bigram (F2) were used.?
Negation and Bag-of-conceptsAn algorithm similar to NegEx (Chapman etal., 2001) was used to find negations in text.A small set of 35 negation keywords, such as?no?, ?without?, and ?no further?, was compiledto trigger the finding of the negated phrasesin text based on the shallow syntactic analy-sis returned by GENIA tagger.
After removingnegated phrases in text, MetaMap was used tofind medical concepts in text as new features ina bag-of-concepts manner (F3 and F4).Different combination of feature types (F5, F6,and F7) were also used in the experiment.
Infor-mation gain was used to rank the features and thefeature cut-off threshold was set to 4, 000.6 Result and DiscussionThe 10-fold cross-validation technique was used inthe experiments.
The 1,954 radiology reports wererandomly divided into ten folds.
In each iteration ofthe experiment, one fold of data was used as the testset and the other nine folds as the training set.The experimental results are shown in Table 2.The flat TC system has achieved higher F1 scoresthan a hierarchical TC system in all experimentalsettings.
However, paired t-test suggests the differ-ences are not statistically significant at a (p < 0.05)level in most cases.
This suggests the potential ofadopting a hierarchical TC approach in the task.
Theeffectiveness of the system is not sacrificed while thesystem now has the potential to scale up to muchlarger problems.Similarly, the hierarchical TC system has betterF hierarchical1 scores than the flat TC system whilethis difference is still not statistically significant ata (p < 0.05) level in most cases.
This is partlydue to the current strategy of not allowing unknownICD-9-CM codes to be assigned in the system.
As aresult, many originally predicted internal nodes wereremoved in a hierarchical TC system.Both the flat and hierarchical systems using bag-of-words feature set F1 have achieved a F1 scoreabove 0.85.
Adding bigram features into F2 hasshown minimum impact on the performance of bothsystems.
Using a bag-of-concepts strategy in F3and F4 has lowered the performance of the system.However, adding F3 and F4 into bag-of-words fea-ture set has improved the performance of both sys-tems.
Finally, the best performance were reportedon using feature set F5 which combines unigram andICD-9-CM concepts returned by MetaMap softwareon the preprocessed text where negated terms wereremoved.7 Conclusion and Future WorkCompared to a flat classification approach, a hier-archical framework is able to exploit relationshipsamong categories to be assigned and easily adaptsto much larger text categorization problems wherereal-time response is needed.
This study has pro-posed a hierarchical text categorization approach tothe task of encoding clinical notes with ICD-9-CMcodes.
The preliminary experiment shows that a hi-erarchical text categorization system has achieved aperformance comparable to other state-of-the-art flatclassification systems.Future work includes developing more sophisti-cated features, such as synonym and phrase-levelparaphrasing and entailment, to encode the knowl-71Feature Description Flat TC Hierarchical TCF1 F (hierarchical)1 F1 F(hierarchical)1F1 Unigram 85.90 ?

How to manage a rich fea-ture set in a hierarchical TC setting would be anotherbig challenge.
Moreover, this work did not use anythresholding tuning technique in the training stage.Therefore, a thorough study on the effectiveness ofthreshold tuning in the task is required.AcknowledgmentsI would like to thank Prof. Jon Patrick for his sup-port and supervision of my research, and Mr. YefengWang for providing his codes on negation finding.
