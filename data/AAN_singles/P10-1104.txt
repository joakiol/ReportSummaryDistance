Proceedings of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 1019?1029,Uppsala, Sweden, 11-16 July 2010. c?2010 Association for Computational LinguisticsCombining data and mathematical models of language changeMorgan SondereggerUniversity of ChicagoChicago, IL, USA.morgan@cs.uchicago.eduPartha NiyogiUniversity of ChicagoChicago, IL, USA.niyogi@cs.uchicago.eduAbstractEnglish noun/verb (N/V) pairs (contract,cement) have undergone complex patternsof change between 3 stress patterns forseveral centuries.
We describe a longitu-dinal dataset of N/V pair pronunciations,leading to a set of properties to be ac-counted for by any computational model.We analyze the dynamics of 5 dynamicalsystems models of linguistic populations,each derived from a model of learning byindividuals.
We compare each model?s dy-namics to a set of properties observed inthe N/V data, and reason about how as-sumptions about individual learning affectpopulation-level dynamics.1 IntroductionThe fascinating phenomena of language evolutionand language change have inspired much workfrom computational perspectives in recent years.Research in this field considers populations of lin-guistic agents, and asks how the population dy-namics are related to the behavior of individualagents.
However, most such work makes littlecontact with empirical data (de Boer and Zuidema,2009).1 As pointed out by Choudhury (2007),most computational work on language changedeals with data from cases of change either not atall, or at a relatively high level.2Recent computational work has addressed ?realworld?
data from change in several languages(Mitchener, 2005; Choudhury et al, 2006; Choud-hury et al, 2007; Pearl and Weinberg, 2007; Da-land et al, 2007; Landsbergen, 2009).
In the same1However, among language evolution researchers therehas been significant recent interest in behavioral experiments,using the ?iterated learning?
paradigm (Griffiths and Kalish,2007; Kalish et al, 2007; Kirby et al, 2008).2We do not review the literature on computational studiesof change due to space constraints; see (Baker, 2008; Wanget al, 2005; Niyogi, 2006) for reviews.spirit, we use data from an ongoing stress shiftin English noun/verb (N/V) pairs.
Because stresshas been listed in dictionaries for several centuries,we are able to trace stress longitudinally and atthe level of individual words, and observe dynam-ics significantly more complicated than in changespreviously considered in the computational litera-ture.
In ?2, we summarize aspects of the dynamicsto be accounted for by any computational model ofthe stress shift.
We also discuss proposed sourcesof these dynamics from the literature, based on ex-perimental work by psychologists and linguists.In ?3?4, we develop models in the mathemati-cal framework of dynamical systems (DS), whichover the past 15 years has been used to modelthe interaction between language learning and lan-guage change in a variety of settings (Niyogiand Berwick, 1995; Niyogi and Berwick, 1996;Niyogi, 2006; Komarova et al, 2001; Yang, 2001;Yang, 2002; Mitchener, 2005; Pearl and Weinberg,2007).We interpret 6 aspects of the N/V stress dy-namics in DS terms; this gives a set of 6 desiredproperties to which any DS model?s dynamics canbe compared.
We consider 5 models of languagelearning by individuals, based on the experimen-tal findings relevant to the N/V stress shift, andevaluate the population-level dynamics of the dy-namical system model resulting from each againstthe set of desired properties.
We are thus able toreason about which theories of the source of lan-guage change ?
considered as hypotheses abouthow individuals learn ?
lead to the population-level patterns observed in change.2 Data: English N/V pairsThe data considered here are the stress patterns ofEnglish homographic, disyllabic noun/verb pairs(Table 1); we refer to these throughout as ?N/Vpairs?.
Each of the N and V forms of a pair canhave initial (???

stress.
We use the notation {Nstress,Vstress}to denote the stress of an N/V pair, with 1=???,2=???.
Of the four logically possible stress pat-terns, all current N/V pairs follow one of the 3patterns shown in Table 1: {1,1}, {1,2}, {2,2}.3No pair follows the fourth possible pattern, {2,1}.N/V pairs have been undergoing variation andchange between these 3 patterns since Middle En-glish (ME, c. 1066-1470), especially change to{1,2}.
The vast majority of stress shifts occurredafter 1570 (Minkova, 1997), when the first dictio-nary listing English word stresses was published(Levens, 1570).
Many dictionaries from the 17thcentury on list word stresses, making it possible totrace change in the stress of individual N/V pairsin considerable detail.2.1 DynamicsExpanding on dictionary pronunciation data col-lected by Sherman (1975) for the period 1570?1800, we have collected a corpus of pronunci-ations of 149 N/V pairs, as listed in 62 Britishdictionaries, published 1570?2007.
Variation andchange in N/V pair stress can be visualized byplotting stress trajectories: the moving average ofN and V stress vs. time for a given pair.
Someexamples are shown in Fig.
1.
The corpus isdescribed in detail in (Sonderegger and Niyogi,2010); here we summarize the relevant facts to beaccounted for in a computational model.4Change Four types of clear-cut change betweenthe three stress patterns are observed:{2,2}?
{1,2} (Fig.1(a)) {1,2}?{1,1}{1,1}?
{1,2} (Fig.
1(b)) {1,2}?
{2,2}However, change to {1,2} is much more com-mon than change from {1,2}; in particular,{2,2}?
{1,2} is the most common change.
When3However, as variation and change in N/V pair stressis ongoing, a few pairs (e.g.
perfume) currently have vari-able stress.
By ?stress?, we always mean ?primary stress?.All present-day pronunciations are for British English, fromCELEX (Baayen et al, 1996).4The corpus is available on the first author?s home page(currently, people.cs.uchicago.edu/?morgan).change occurs, it is often fairly sudden, as inFigs.
1(a), 1(b).
Finally, change never occurs di-rectly between {1,1} and {2,2}.Stability Previous work on stress in N/V pairs(Sherman, 1975; Phillips, 1984) has emphasizedchange, in particular {2,2}?
{1,2} (the most com-mon change).
However, an important aspect ofthe diachronic dynamics of N/V pairs is stability:most N/V pairs do not show variation or change.The 149 N/V pairs, used both in our corpus andin previous work, were chosen by Sherman (1975)as those most likely to have undergone change,and thus are not suitable for studying how stablethe three attested stress patterns are.
In a ran-dom sample of N/V pairs (not the set of 149) inuse over a fixed time period (1700?2007), we findthat only 12% have shown variation or change instress (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010).
Most pairsmaintain the {1,1}, {2,2}, or {1,2} stress patternfor hundreds of years.
A model of the diachronicdynamics of N/V pair stress must explain how itcan be the case both that some pairs show varia-tion and change, and that many do not.Variation N/V pair stress patterns show bothsynchronic and diachronic variation.Synchronically, there is variation at the pop-ulation level in the stress of some N/V pairs atany given time; this is reflected by the inclusionof more than one pronunciation for some N/Vpairs in many dictionaries.
An important questionfor modeling is whether there is variation withinindividual speakers.
We show in (Sondereggerand Niyogi, 2010) that there is, for present-dayAmerican English speakers, using a corpus of ra-dio speech.
For several N/V pairs which havecurrently variable pronunciation, 1/3 of speakersshow variation in the stress of the N form.
Metricalevidence from poetry suggests that individual vari-ation also existed in the past; the best evidence isfor Shakespeare, who shows variation in the stressof over 20 N/V pairs (Ko?keritz, 1953).Diachronically, a relevant question for mod-eling is whether all variation is short-lived, orwhether stable variation is possible.
A particu-lar type of stable variation is in fact observed rela-tively often in the corpus: either the N or V formstably vary (Fig.
1(c)), but not both at once.
Stablevariation where both N and V forms vary almostnever occurs (Fig.
1(d)).Frequency dependence Phillips (1984) hypoth-10201700 1800 1900 200011.21.41.61.82 concertYearMoving averageof stressplacement(a) concert1700 1800 1900 200011.21.41.61.82 combatYearMoving averageof stressplacement(b) combat1700 1800 1900 200011.21.41.61.82 exileYearMoving averageof stressplacement(c) exile1850 1900 1950 200011.21.41.61.82 rampageYearMoving averageof stressplacement(d) rampageFigure 1: Example N/V pair stress trajectories.

Solid lines=nouns, dashed lines=verbs.esizes that N/V pairs with lower frequencies(summed N+V word frequencies) are more likelyto change to {1,2}.
Sonderegger (2010) showsthat this is the case for the most common change,{2,2}?
{1,2}: among N/V pairs which were{2,2} in 1700 and are either {2,2} or {1,2} today,those which have undergone change have signif-icantly lower frequencies, on average, than thosewhich have not.
In (Sonderegger and Niyogi,2010), we give preliminary evidence from real-time frequency trajectories (for <10 N/V pairs)that it is not lower frequency per se which triggerschange to {1,2}, but falling frequency.
For exam-ple, change in combat from {1,1}?
{1,2} around1800 (Fig.
1(b)) coincides with falling word fre-quency from 1775?present.2.2 Sources of changeThe most salient facts about English N/V pairstress are that (a) change is most often to {1,2}(b) the {2,1} pattern never occurs.
We summa-rize two types of explanation for these facts fromthe experimental literature, each of which exem-plifies a commonly-proposed type of explanationfor phonological change.
In both cases, there is ex-perimental evidence for biases in present-day En-glish speakers reflecting (a?b).
We assume thatthese biases have been active over the course ofthe N/V stress shift, and can thus be seen as pos-sible sources of the diachronic dynamics of N/Vpairs.55This type of assumption is necessary for any hypothesisabout the sources of a completed or ongoing change, basedon present-day experimental evidence, and is thus common inthe literature.
In the case of N/V pairs, it is implicitly made inKelly?s (1988 et seq) account, discussed below.
Both biasesdiscussed here stem from facts about English (Ross?
Gener-alization; rhythmic context) that we believe have not changedover the time period considered here (?1600?present), basedon general accounts of English historical phonology duringthis period (Lass, 1992; MacMahon, 1998).
We leave morecareful verification of this claim to future work.Analogy/Lexicon In historical linguistics, ana-logical changes are those which make ?...relatedforms more similar to each other in their phonetic(and morphological) structure?
(Hock, 1991).6Proposed causes for analogical change thus ofteninvolve a speaker?s production and perception ofa form being influenced by similar forms in theirlexicon.The English lexicon shows a broad tendency,which we call Ross?
generalization, which couldbe argued to be driving analogical change to {1,2},and acting against the unobserved stress pattern{2,1}: ?primary stress in English nouns is fartherto the left than primary stress in English verbs?
(Ross, 1973).
Change to {1,2} could be seenas motivated by Ross?
generalization, and {2,1}made impossible by it.The argument is lent plausibility by experimen-tal evidence that Ross?
Generalization is reflectedin production and perception.
English listenersstrongly prefer the typical stress pattern (N=???
orV=???)
in novel English disyllables (Guion et al,2003), and process atypical disyllables (N=???
orV=???)
more slowly than typical ones (Arciuli andCupples, 2003).Mistransmission An influential line of researchholds that many phonological changes are basedin asymmetric transmission errors: because of ar-ticulatory or perceptual factors, listeners systemat-ically mishear some sound ?
as ?, but rarely mis-hear ?
as ?.7 We call such effects mistransmis-sion.
Asymmetric mistransmission (by individu-6?Forms?
here means any linguistic unit; e.g.
sounds,words, or paradigms, such as an N/V pair?s stress pattern.7A standard example is final obstruent devoicing, a com-mon change cross-linguistically.
There are several articula-tory and perceptual reasons why final voiced obstruents couldbe heard as unvoiced, but no motivation for the reverse pro-cess (final unvoiced obstruents heard as voiced) (Blevins,2006).1021als) is argued to be a necessary condition for thechange ???
at the population level, and an ex-planation for why the change ???
is common,while the change ???
is rarely (or never) ob-served.
Mistransmission-based explanations werepioneered by Ohala (1981, et seq.
), and are thesubject of much recent work (reviewed by Hans-son, 2008)For English N/V pairs, M. Kelly and collabo-rators have shown mistransmission effects whichthey propose are responsible for the directionalityof the most common type of N/V pair stress shifts({1,1}, {2,2}?
{1,2}), based on ?rhythmic con-text?
(Kelly, 1988; Kelly and Bock, 1988; Kelly,1989).
Word stress is misperceived more oftenas initial in ?trochaic-biasing?
contexts, where thepreceding syllable is weak or the following syl-lable is heavy; and more often as final in anal-ogously ?iambic-biasing?
contexts.
Nouns occurmore frequently in trochaic contexts, and verbsmore frequently in iambic contexts; there is thuspressure for the V forms of {1,1} pairs to be mis-perceived as ??
?, and for the N forms of {2,2} pairsto be misperceived as ??
?.3 Modeling preliminariesWe first describe assumptions and notation formodels developed below (?4).Because of the evidence for within-speakervariation in N/V pair stress (?2.1), in all modelsdescribed below, we assume that what is learnedfor a given N/V pair are the probabilities of usingthe ???
form for the N and V forms.We also make several simplifying assumptions.There are discrete generations Gt, and learners inGt learn from Gt?1.
Each example a learner in Gthears is equally likely to come from any memberof Gt?1.
Each learner receives an identical num-ber of examples, and each generation has infinitelymany members.These are idealizations, adopted here to keepmodels simple enough to analyze; the effects ofrelaxing some of these assumptions have been ex-plored by Niyogi (2006) and Sonderegger (2009).The infinite-population assumption in particularmakes the dynamics fully deterministic; this rulesout the possibility of change due to drift (or sam-ple variation), where a form disappears from thepopulation because no examples of it are encoun-tered by learners in Gt in the input from Gt?1.Notation For a fixed N/V pair, a learner in Gthears N1 examples of the N form, of which kt1 are???
and (N1-kt1) are ???
; N2 and kt2 are similarlydefined for V examples.
Each example is sampledi.i.d.
from a random member of Gt?1.
The Ni arefixed (each learner hears the same number of ex-amples), while the kti are random variables (overlearners in Gt).
Each learner applies an algorithmA to the N1+N2 examples to learn ?
?t, ?
?t ?
[0, 1],the probabilities of producing N and V examplesas ???.
?t, ?t are the expectation of ?
?t and ?
?t overmembers of Gt: ?t = E(?
?t), ?t = E(??t).
?
?t and?
?t are thus random variables (over learners in Gt),while ?t, ?t ?
[0, 1] are numbers.Because learners in Gt draw examples at ran-dom from members of Gt?1, the distributionsof ?
?t and ?
?t are determined by (?t?1, ?t?1).
(?t, ?t), the expectations of ?
?t and ?
?t, are thusdetermined by (?t?1, ?t?1) via an iterated map f :f : [0, 1]2 ?
[0, 1]2, f(?t, ?t) = (?t+1, ?t+1).3.1 Dynamical systemsWe develop and analyze models of populations oflanguage learners in the mathematical frameworkof (discrete) dynamical systems (DS) (Niyogi andBerwick, 1995; Niyogi, 2006).
This setting allowsus to determine the diachronic, population-levelconsequences of assumptions about the learningalgorithm used by individuals, as well as assump-tions about population structure or the input theyreceive.Because it is in general impossible to solve agiven iterated map as a function of t, the dynam-ical systems viewpoint is to understand its long-term behavior by finding its fixed points and bi-furcations: changes in the number and stability offixed points as system parameters vary.Briefly, ??
is a fixed point (FP) of f if f(??)
=??
; it is stable if limt??
?t = ??
for ?0 sufficientlynear ?
?, and unstable otherwise; these are alsocalled stable states and unstable states.
Intuitively,??
is stable iff the system is stable under small per-turbations from ?
?.8In the context of a linguistic population, changefrom state ?
(100% of the population uses {1,1})to state ?
(100% of the population uses {1,2})corresponds to a bifurcation, where some systemparameter (N ) passes a critical value (N0).
For8See (Strogatz, 1994; Hirsch et al, 2004) for introduc-tions to dynamical systems in general, and (Niyogi, 2006) forthe type of models considered here.1022N<N0, ?
is stable.
For N>N0, ?
is unstable,and ?
is stable; this triggers change from ?
to ?.3.2 DS interpretation of observed dynamicsBelow, we describe 5 DS models of linguistic pop-ulations.
To interpret whether each model hasproperties consistent with the N/V dataset, wetranslate the observations about the dynamics ofN/V stress made above (?2.1) into DS terms.
Thisgives a list of desired properties against which toevaluate the properties of each model.1.
?
{2,1}: {2,1} is not a stable state.2.
Stability of {1,1}, {1,2}, {2,2}: These stresspatterns correspond to stable states (for somesystem parameter values).3.
Observed stable variation: Stable states arepossible (for some system parameter values)corresponding to variation in the N or Vform, but not both.4.
Sudden change: Change from one stress pat-tern to another corresponds to a bifurcation,where the fixed point corresponding to theold stress pattern becomes unstable.5.
Observed changes: There are bifurcationscorresponding to each of the four observedchanges ({1,1}??
{1,2}, {2,2}??
{1,2}).6.
Observed frequency dependence: Change to{1,2} corresponds to a bifurcation in fre-quency (N ), where {2,2} or {1,1} loses sta-bility as N is decreased.4 ModelsWe now describe 5 DS models, each correspond-ing to a learning algorithm A used by individuallanguage learners.
Each A leads to an iteratedmap, f(?t, ?t) = (?t+1, ?t+1), which describesthe state of the population of learners over succes-sive generations.
We give these evolution equa-tions for each model, then discuss their dynamics,i.e.
bifurcation structure.
Each model?s dynam-ics are evaluated with respect to the set of desiredproperties corresponding to patterns observed inthe N/V data.
Derivations have been mostly omit-ted for reasons of space, but are given in (Son-deregger, 2009).The models differ along two dimensions, cor-responding to assumptions about the learning al-gorithm (A): whether or not it is assumed thatthe stress of examples is possibly mistransmitted(Models 1, 3, 5), and how the N and V probabil-ities acquired by a given learner are coupled.
InModel 1 there is no coupling (?
?t and ?
?t learnedindependently), in Models 2?3 coupling takes theform of a hard constraint corresponding to Ross?generalization, and in Models 4?5 different stresspatterns have different prior probabilities.94.1 Model 1: MistransmissionMotivated by the evidence for asymmetric mis-perception of N/V pair stress (?2.2), suppose thestress of N=???
and V=???
examples may be mis-perceived (as N=???
and V=???
), with mistrans-mission probabilities p and q.Learners are assumed to simply probabilitymatch: ?
?t = kt1/N1, ?
?t = kt2/N2, where kt1 is thenumber of N and V examples heard as ???
(etc.
)The probabilities pN,t & pV,t of hearing an N or Vexample as final stressed at t are thenpN,t = ?t?1(1?
p), pV,t = ?t?1 + (1?
?t?1)q (1)kt1 and kt2 are binomially-distributed:PB(kt1, kt2) ?(N1kt1)pN,tkt1(1?
pN,t)N1?kt1?(N2kt2)pV,tkt2(1?
pV,t)N2?kt2 (2)?t and ?t, the probability that a random memberof Gt produces N and V examples as ??
?, are theensemble averages of ?
?t and ?
?t over all membersof Gt.
Because we have assumed infinitely manylearners per generation, ?t=E(?
?t) and ?t=E(?
?t).Using (1), and the formula for the expectation of abinomially-distributed random variable:?t = ?t?1(1?
p) (3)?t = ?t?1 + (1?
?t?1)q (4)these are the evolution equations for Model 1.Due to space constraints we do not give the (morelengthy) derivations of the evolution equations inModels 2?5.Dynamics There is a single, stable fixed pointof evolution equations (3?4): (?
?, ??)
= (0, 1),corresponding to the stress pattern {1,2}.
Thismodel thus shows none of the desired propertiesdiscussed in ?3.2, except that {1,2} correspondsto a stable state.9The sixth possible model (no coupling, no mistransmis-sion) is a special case of Model 1, resulting in the identitymap: ?t+1 = ?t, ?t+1 = ?t.10234.2 Model 2: Coupling by constraintMotivated by the evidence for English speak-ers?
productive knowledge of Ross?
Generaliza-tion (?2.2), we consider a second learning modelin which the learner attempts to probability matchas above, but the (?
?t, ?
?t) learned must satisfy theconstraint that ???
stress be more probable in theV form than in the N form.Formally, the learner chooses (?
?t, ?
?t) satisfyinga quadratic optimization problem:minimize [(?
?kt1N1)2 + (?
?kt2N2)2] s.t.
?
?
?This corresponds to the following algorithm, A2:1.
If kt1N1< kt2N2, set ?
?t =kt1N1, ?
?t =kt2N2.2.
Otherwise, set ?
?t = ?
?t = 12 (kt1N1+ kt2N2)The resulting evolution equations can be shown tobe?t+1 = ?t +A2, ?t+1 = ?t ?A2(5)where A =?k1N1> k2N2PB(kt1, kt2)(kt1N1?kt2N2).Dynamics Adding the equations in (5)gives that the (?t, ?t) trajectories are linesof constant ?t + ?t (Fig.
2).
All (0, x)and (x, 1) (x?
[0, 1]) are stable fixed points.1.01.000Figure 2: Dynamicsof Model 2This model thus has sta-ble FPs corresponding to{1,1}, {1,2}, and {2,2},does not have {2,1} asa stable FP (by construc-tion), and allows for sta-ble variation in exactlyone of N or V. It doesnot have bifurcations, orthe observed patterns ofchange and frequency de-pendence.4.3 Model 3: Coupling by constraint, withmistransmissionWe now assume that each example is subject tomistransmission, as in Model 1; the learner thenapplies A2 to the heard examples.
The evolutionequations are thus the same as in (5), but with ?t?1and ?t?1 changed to pN,t, pV,t (Eqn.
1).Dynamics There is a single, stable fixed point,corresponding to stable variation in both N and V.This model thus shows none of the desired prop-erties, except that {2,1} is not a stable FP (by con-struction).4.4 Model 4: Coupling by priorsThe type of coupling assume in Models 2?3 ?
aconstraint on the relative probability of ???
stressfor N and V forms ?
has the drawback that thereis no way for the rest of the lexicon to affect apair?s N and V stress probabilities: there can be noinfluence of the stress of other N/V pairs, or in thelexicon as a whole, on the N/V pair being learned.Models 4?5 allow such influence by formalizing asimple intuitive explanation for the lack of {2, 1}N/V pairs: learners cannot hypothesize a {2, 1}pair because there is no support for this pattern intheir lexicons.We now assume that learners compute the prob-abilities of each possible N/V pair stress pattern,rather than separate probabilities for the N and Vforms.
We assume that learners keep two sets ofprobabilities (for {1, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 1}, {2, 2}):1.
Learned probabilities:~P=(P11, P12, P22, P21), whereP11 =N1?kt1N1N2?kt2N2, P12 =N1?kt1N1kt2N2P22 =kt1N1kt2N2, P21 =kt1N1N2?kt2N22.
Prior probabilities: ~?
= (?11, ?12, ?21, ?22),based on the support for each stress pattern inthe lexicon.The learner then produces N forms as follows:1.
Pick a pattern {n1, v1} according to ~P .2.
Pick a pattern {n2, v2} according to ~?3.
Repeat 1?2 until n1=n2, then produce N=n1.V forms are produced similarly, but checkingwhether v1 = v2 at step 3.
Learners?
production ofan N/V pair is thus influenced by both their learn-ing experience (for the particular N/V pair) and byhow much support exists in their lexicon for thedifferent stress patterns.We leave the exact interpretation of the ?ij am-biguous; they could be the percentage of N/V pairsalready learned which follow each stress pattern,for example.
Motivated by the absence of {2,1}N/V pairs in English, we assume that ?21 = 0.1024By following the production algorithm above,the learner?s probabilities of producing N and Vforms as ???
are:?

{2,2}, {2,2}??{1,2}).
For example, sup-pose the system is at stable FP (1, 1) (correspond-ing to {2,2}) in region 2.
As ?22 is decreased, wemove into region 1, (1, 1) becomes unstable, andthe system shifts to stable FP (0, 1).
This transi-tion corresponds to change from {2,2} to {1,2}.Note that change to {1,2} entails crossing thehyperplanes ?12=?22 and ?12=?11.
These hy-perplanes do not change as N1 and N2 vary, so0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0?110.00.20.40.60.81.0?

Numbers areregions of parameter space (see text).change to {1,2} is not frequency-dependent.
How-ever, change from {1,2} entails crossing the hy-perplane R=1, which does change as N1 and N2vary (Eqn.
10), so change from {1,2} is frequency-dependent.
Thus, although there is frequency de-pendence in this model, it is not as observed inthe diachronic data, where change to {1,2} isfrequency-dependent.Finally, no stable variation is possible: in everystable state, all members of the population cate-gorically use a single stress pattern.
{2,1} is nevera stable FP, by construction.4.5 Model 5: Coupling by priors, withmistransmissionWe now suppose that each example from alearner?s data is possibly mistransmitted, as inModel 1; the learner then applies the algorithmfrom Model 4 to the heard examples (instead ofusing kt1, kt2) .
The evolution equations are thusthe same as (8?9), but with ?t?1 and ?t?1 changedto pN,t, pV,t (Eqn.
1).Dynamics (0, 1) is always a fixed point.
Forsome regions of parameter space, there can be onefixed point of the form (?, 1), as well as one fixedpoint of the form (0, ?
), where ?, ?

(?, 1).The parameter space is again split into theseregions by three hyperplanes: ??11=?
?12, ??22=??12,andR?=1.
As in Model 4, the bifurcation structureimplies all 6 possible changes between the threeFPs.
However, change to {1,2} entails crossingthe hyperplanes ??11=?
?12 and ??2=?
?12, and is thusnow frequency dependent.In particular, consider a system at a stable FP(?, 1), for some N/V pair.
This FP becomes un-stable if ?
?22 becomes smaller than ??12.
Assumingthat the ?ij are fixed, this occurs only if N1 fallsbelow a critical value, N?1 = (1??22?12(1?
p))?1;the system would then transition to (0, 1), the onlystable state.
By a similar argument, falling fre-quency can lead to change from (0, ?)
to (0, 1).Falling frequency can thus cause change to {1,2}in this model, as seen in the N/V data; Fig.
4 showsan example.Unlike in Model 4, stable variation of the typeseen in the N/V stress trajectories ?
one of N or Vstably varying, but not both ?
is possible for someparameter values.
(0, 0) and (1, 1) (correspondingto {1,1} and {2,2}) are technically never possible,but effectively occur for FPs of the form (?, 0) and(?, 1) when ?
or ?
are small.
{2,1} is never a sta-ble FP, by construction.This model thus arguably shows all of the de-sired properties seen in the N/V data.PropertyModel1 2 3 4 5?

Models includingasymmetric mistransmission (1, 3, 5) generally donot lead to stable states in which the entire pop-ulation uses {1,1} or {2,2}.
(In Model 5, sta-ble variation very near {1,1} or {2,2} is possi-ble.)
However, {1,1} and {2,2} are diachroni-cally very stable stress patterns, suggesting that atleast for this model set, assuming mistransmissionin the learner is problematic.
Models 2?3, whereanalogy is implemented as a hard constraint basedon Ross?
generalization, do not give most desiredproperties.
Models 4?5, where analogy is imple-mented as prior probabilities over N/V stress pat-terns, show crucial aspects of the observed dynam-ics: bifurcations corresponding to the changes ob-served in the stress data.
Model 5 shows changeto {1,2} triggered by falling frequency, a patternobserved in the stress data, and an emergent prop-erty of the model dynamics: this frequency effectis not present in Models 1 or 4, but is present inModel 5, where the learner combines mistransmis-sion (Model 1) with coupling by priors (Model 4).5 DiscussionWe have developed 5 dynamical systems modelsfor a relatively complex diachronic change, foundone successful model, and were able to reasonabout the source of model behavior.
Each modeldescribes the diachronic, population-level conse-quences of assuming a particular learning algo-rithm for individuals.
The algorithms considered1026were motivated by different possible sources ofchange, from linguistics and psychology (?2.2).We discuss novel contributions of this work, andfuture directions.The dataset used here shows more complex dy-namics, to our knowledge, than in changes previ-ously considered in the computational literature.By using a detailed, longitudinal dataset, we wereable to strongly constrain the desired behavior ofa computational model, so that the task of modelbuilding is not ?doomed to success?.
While allmodels show some patterns observed in the data,only one shows all such properties.
We believe de-tailed datasets are potentially very useful for eval-uating and differentiating between proposed com-putational models of change.This paper is a first attempt to integrate detaileddata with a range of DS models.
We have onlyconsidered some schematic properties of the dy-namics observed in our dataset, and used theseto qualitatively compare each model?s predictionsto the dynamics.
Future work should considerthe dynamics in more detail, develop more com-plex models (for example, by relaxing the infinite-population assumption, allowing for stochastic dy-namics), and quantitatively compare model pre-dictions and observed dynamics.We were able to reason about how assump-tions about individual learning affect populationdynamics by analyzing a range of simple, relatedmodels.
This approach is pursued in more depthin the larger set of models considered in (Son-deregger, 2009).
Our use of model comparisoncontrasts with most recent computational work onchange, where a small number (1?2) of very com-plex models are analyzed, allowing for much moredetailed models of language learning and usagethan those considered here (e.g.
Choudhury et al,2006; Minett & Wang, 2008; Baxter et al, 2009;Landsbergen, 2009).
An advantage of our ap-proach is an enhanced ability to evaluate a range ofproposed causes for a particular case of languagechange.By using simple models, we were able to con-sider a range of learning algorithms correspond-ing to different explanations for the observed di-achronic dynamics.
What makes this a useful ex-ercise is the fundamentally non-trivial map, illus-trated by Models 1?5, between individual learn-ing and population-level dynamics.
Although thetype of individual learning assumed in each modelwas chosen with the same patterns of change inmind, and despite the simplicity of the modelsused, the resulting population-level dynamics dif-fer greatly.
This is an important point given thatproposed explanations for change (e.g., mistrans-mission and analogy) operate at the level of in-dividuals, while the phenomena being explained(patterns of change, or particular changes) are as-pects of the population-level dynamics.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Max Bane, James Kirby, and threeanonymous reviewers for helpful comments.ReferencesJ.
