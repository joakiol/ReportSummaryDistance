Proceedings of the BioNLP Workshop on Linking Natural Language Processing and Biology at HLT-NAACL 06, pages 120?121,New York City, June 2006. c?2006 Association for Computational LinguisticsExtracting Protein-Protein interactions using simple contextual featuresLeif Arda NielsenSchool of InformaticsUniversity of Edinburghleif.nielsen@gmail.com1 IntroductionThere has been much interest in recent years on thetopic of extracting Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI)information automatically from scientific publica-tions.
This is due to the need that has emerged toorganise the large body of literature that is gener-ated through research, and collected at sites suchas PubMed.
Easy access to the information con-tained in published work is vital for facilitating newresearch, but the rate of publication makes manualcollection of all such data unfeasible.
InformationExtraction approaches based on Natural LanguageProcessing can be, and are already being used, to fa-cilitate this process.The dominant approach so far has been the useof hand-built, knowledge-based systems, workingat levels ranging from surface syntax to full parses(Blaschke and Valencia, 2002; Huang et al, 2004;Plake et al, 2005; Rebholz-Schuhmann et al, 2005;Yakushiji et al, 2005).
A similar work to the onepresented here is by (Sugiyama et al, 2003), but itis not possible to compare results due to differingdatasets and the limited information available abouttheir methods.2 DataA gene-interaction corpus derived from the BioCre-AtIvE task-1A data will be used for the experiments.This data was kindly made available by Jo?rg Haken-berg1 and is described in (Plake et al, 2005).
Thedata consists of 1000 sentences marked up for POS1See http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/ haken-ber/publ/suppl/sac05/tags, genes (both genes and proteins are marked as?gene?
; the terms will be used interchangeably inthis paper) and iWords.
The corpus contains 255relations, all of which are intra-sentential, and the?interaction word?
(iWord)2 for each relation is alsomarked up.I utilise the annotated entities, and focus only onrelation extraction.
The data contains directionalityinformation for each relation, denoting which entityis the ?agent?
and which the ?target?, or denoting thatthis distinction cannot be made.
This informationwill not be used for the current experiments, as mymain aim is simply to identify relations between en-tities, and the derivation of this information will beleft for future work.I will be using the Naive Bayes, KStar, and JRipclassifiers from the Weka toolkit, Zhang Le?s Maxi-mum Entropy classifier (Maxent), TiMBL, and Lib-SVM to test performance.
All experiments are doneusing 10-fold cross-validation.
Performance will bemeasured using Recall, Precision and F1.3 ExperimentsEach possible combination of proteins and iWordsin a sentence was generated as a possible relation?triple?, which combines the relation extraction taskwith the additional task of finding the iWord to de-scribe each relation.
3400 such triples occur in thedata.
After each instance is given a probability bythe classifiers, the highest scoring instance for eachprotein pairing is compared to a threshold to decide2A limited set of words that have been determined to be in-formative of when a PPI occurs, such as interact, bind, inhibit,phosphorylation.

Correct triples are those that match theiWord assigned to a PPI by the annotators.For each instance, a list of features were used toconstruct a ?generic?

The system achieves a peak per-3These patterns are in regular expression form, i.e.

This particular patternmatches sentences where a protein is followed by an iWord thatis a verb, with a maximum of n words between them, and fol-lowing this by m words maximum is another protein.
