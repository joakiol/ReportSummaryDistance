The St ructure  of  User -Adv iser  D ia logues :  Is there  Method  in the i r  Madness?Raymonde GuindonMicroeleetronies and Computer Technology Corporation - MCCPaul SladkyUniversity of  Texas, Austin 8J MCCHans Brunner Joyee ConnerHoneywell - Computer Sciences Center MCCABSTRACT FOCUSING AND ANAPHORA RESOLUTIONNovice users engaged in task-oriented dialogues with anadviser to learn how to use an unfamiliar statisticalpackage.
The users', task was analyzed and a taskstructure was derived.
The task structure was used tosegment the dialogue into subdialogues associated withthe subtasks of the overall task.
The representation fthe dialogue structure into a hierarchy of subdialogues,partly corresponding to the task structure, wasvalidated by three converging analyses.
First, thedistribution of non-pronominal noun phrases and thedistribution of pronominal noun phrases exhibited apattern consistent with the derived dialogue structure.Non-pronominal noun phrases occurred more frequentlyat the beginning of subdialogues than later, as can beexpected since one of their functions is to indicate topicshifts.
On the other hand, pronominal noun phrasesoccurred less frequently in the first sentence of thesubdialogues than in the following sentences of thesubdialogues, as can be expected since they are used toindicate topic continuity.
Second, the distributions ofthe antecedents of pronominal noun phrases and ofnon-pronominal noun phrases showed a patternconsistent with the derived dialogue structure.
FinMly,distinctive clue words and phrases were found reliablyat the boundaries of subdialogues with differentfunctions.INTRODUCTIONThe goal of this paper is to find evidence for the notion ofdialogue s t ructure  as it has been developed in computationallinguistics (Grosz, 1977; Sidner and Grosz, 1985).
The role of twohypothesized determinants of discourse structure will be examined:i) the structure of the task that the user is trying to accomplishand the user's goals and plans arising from the task; 2) thestrategies available to the user when the user is unable to achievethe task or parts of the task (i.e., meta-plans).
The study ofdialogue structures i important because computationally complexphenomena such as anaphora resolution have been theoreticallylinked to the task and dialogue structures.D ia logue  St ructure :  A Key  to  Comput ing  FocusGiven the computational expense of searching, of inferentialprocessing, and of semantic consistency checking required toresolve anaphors, restricting the search a priori to a likely set ofantecedents seems advantageous.
The a priori restriction on theset of potential antecedents for anaphora resolution has been calledfocusing (Grosz, 1977; Guindon, 1985; Reichman, 1981; Sidner,1983).
Grosz defines a focus space as that subset of theparticipant's total knowledge that is in the focus of attention andthat is relevant o process a discourse segment.Task-oriented dialogues are dialogues between conversantswhose goals are to accomplish some specific tasks by exchanginginformation through the dialogues.
Task-oriented ialogues arebelieved to exhibit a structure corresponding to the structure ofthe task being performed.
The entire dialogue is segmented intosubordinated subdialogues in a manner parallel to thesegmentation f the whole task into subordinated subtasks.
Grosz(1977) assumes that the task hierarchy imposes a hierarchy on thesubdialogue segments.
As a subtask of the task is performed (andits corresponding subdialogue is expressed), the different objectsand actions associated with this subtask come into focus.
As thissubtask is completed (and its corresponding subdialogue), itsassociated objects and actions leave focus.
The task of which thecompleted subtask is a part then returns in focus.
Thesegmentation of a dialogue into interrelated subdialogues isassociated with shifts in focus occurring during the dialogue.Detailed task structures for each problem given in this study canbe found in Guindon, Sladky, Brunner, and Conner (1986).A cognitive model of anaphora resolution and focusing isprovided in Guindon (1985) and Kintsch and van Dijk (1978).Human memory is divided into a short-term emory and a long-term memory.
Short-term memory is divided into a cache and abuffer.
The cache contains items from previous entences and thebuffer holds the incoming sentence.
Short-term memory can onlycontain a small number of text items and its retrieval time is fast.Long-term memory can contain a very large number of text itemsbut its retrieval time is slow.
During the integration of a newsentence, the T most important and R most recent items in short-term memory are held over in the cache.
Items in focus are theitems in the cache and are more rapidly retrieved.
Items not infocus are items in long-term memory and are more slowlyretrieved.
Because the cache contains important items that arenot necessarily recent, pronouns can be used to refer to items thathave been mentioned many sentences back.
An empirical studydemonstrates the cognitive basis for focusing, topic shifts, the useof pronominal noun phrases to refer to antecedents in focus, andthe use of non-pronominal noun phrases to refer to antecedents notin focus.224Gross and Sidner (1985) distinguishes three structures in adiscourse structure: 1) the structure of the sequence of utterances,2) the structure of the intentions conveyed, and 3) the attentionalstate.
Distinguishing these three structures gives a better accountof discourse phenomena such as boundary markers, anaphors, andinterruptions.
This paper will cover mainly the second structureand will attempt o find evidence linking the dialogue structure tothe task structure.
The main point is that the structure of theintentions conveyed in the discourse should mirror to some extentthe task structure (but see the next section).
The first structure ofthe dialogue, the structure of the sequence of utterances, willactually be examined with the pronominal and non-pronominalnoun phrase distributions, the antecedent distribution, and theboundary marker analyses.
We expect that these three analyseswill support the derived dialogue structure, the intentionalstructure.
The last structure, the attentional structure, is notdiscussed here but has been discussed in Guindon (1985).
',\The main point of "focusing" theories of anaphora resolutionis that the discourse structure, based on the task structure, is acrucial determinant of which discourse ntities are held in focusand are readily accessible for anaphora resolution.
Subdialoguesthat are in focus are contexts that are used to restrict the searchfor antecedents of anaphors.Task  S t ructure  Can  On ly  Par t ia l l y  DetermineD ia logue  St ructureIn any case, the task structure can only partially determinethe goals and plans of the novice user and, indirectly, the dialoguestructure.
This is because the novice user does not have a goodmodel of the task and is in the process of building one and becausethe adviser only has a partially correct model of what the noviceuser knows about the task.
The verbal interaction between theuser and the adviser is not just one of execution of plans andrecognition of plans but rather one of situated actions anddetection and repair  of imperfect unders tand ing  (Suchman,1985).As a consequence, the dialogue structures from our datacontained subdialogues that functioned as clarification (i.e.,request of information) to correct imperfect understanding or asacknowledgement o verify understanding between theparticipants.
The notion of meta-plans allows us to account forthe presence of clarification and acknowledgement subdialogues(see Litman and Allen, 1984).RESEARCH GOALSThere are many unanswered questions about the nature ofdialogue structures, about the validity and usefulness of theconcept of a dialogue structure, about the role of the taskstructure in determining dialogue structure, and in thecontribution of the task structure to focusing and anaphoraresolution.
For example, the precise mechanisms to determine theinitial focus and to update it on the basis of the dialogue structureare still unknown (Sidner, 1983).The goal of this paper is to find evidence for the validity ofthe notion of discourse structure derived from the task structureby: 1) describing a technique to derive the structure of dialoguesand 2) validating the derived dialogue structure by threeindependent converging analyses: a) the distribution of non-pronominal and pronominal noun phrases b) the distribution ofantecedents of pronominal and non-pronominal naphors, and c)the presence of subdialogue boundary markers,If complete subdialogucs get into and out of focus and ifsubdialogues are conceived as contexts restricting the set ofantecedents o be searched and tested during anaphora resolution,identifying the appropriate unit of discourse corresponding tothese subdialogues is crucial.One phenomenon that should have correspondence to thedialogue structure is the distribution of non-pronominal andpronominal noun phrases.
Non-pronominal noun phrases can beused to introduce new entities in the dialogue or to reinstate intofocus a previous dialogue entity out of focus.
In other words, non-pronominal noun phrases are used to indicate topic shifts.
As aconsequence, they should tend to occur more frequently at thebeginning of the subdialogues than later in the subdialogues.
Onthe other hand, pronominal noun phrases are used to refer toentities currently in focus.
In other words, pronominal nounphrases are used to indicate topic continuity.
As a consequence,they should tend to occur less frequently in the first sentence of asubdialogue but more frequently in subsequent sentences.Empirical evidence for these claims are presented in Guindon(1985).
She found that anaphora resolution time is faster forpronominal noun phrases whose antecedents are in focus than forthose whose antecedents are not in focus.
On the other hand, shefound faster anaphora resolution time for non-pronominal nounphrases whose antecedents were not  in focus than for those whoseantecedents were in focus.
In other words, the form of theanaphor signals whether the antecedent is in focus (as when theanaphor is pronominal) or not in focus (as when the anaphor isnon-pronominal).
Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983) have madesimilar claims about the role of non-pronominal definite nounphrases and pronominal definite noun phrases.In linguistics, Clancey (cited in Fox, 1985) found that the useof definite non-pronominM noun phrases was associated withepisode boundaries.
Psychological evidence has shown the specialstatus in memory for certain sentences in discourse found at thebeginning of paragraphs.
Sentences which belong to themacrostructure (i.e.
gist) of the discourse have been shown to berecognized with more accuracy and faster than sentences belongingto the microstructnre (Guindon and Kintsch, 1984).Macrostructure sentences are by definition more abstract andimportant than microstructure sentences.
They express asummary of the or part of the discourse.
The macrostructuresentences tend to be the first sentences in paragraphs and becomposed of non-pronominal definite noun phrases (van Dijk andKinstch, 1983).Linde (1979) observed the distribution of it  and that indescriptions of houses or apartments.
She found that shifts infocus were associated with change in the room described.
Thepronoun it  was used to describe objects in focus either associatedwith the room then described or to the entire apartment evenwhen the apartment itself had not been mentioned for manysentences.
The pronoun that was used either to refer to an objectoutside the focus or to an object in focus when the descriptionof the object was in contrast with another description.
Grosz(1977) observed a similar use of the pronoun it  in her dialogues tothe use of it  in Linde's dialogues.225In summary, the most important sentences, often at thebeginning of new paragraphs, tend to be composed of full definitenoun phrases.
These sentences often introduce a new discourseentity or reinstate a former one which was out of focus, creating atopic shift.
Sentences which are nsubordinatedh to the mostimportant sentence in the paragraph tend to be composed ofpronouns and signal topic continuity.Another clue to dialogue structures is the distribution ofantecedents of anaphors.
Given that pronominals are used to referto important or recent concepts (Guindon, 1985), the distributionof antecedents of pronominal anaphors should cluster in thecurrent subdialogue (i.e.
recency or importance), its parent (i.e.importance and recency), and the root subdialogue (i.e.importance).
On the other hand, because non-pronominalanaphors are more informative than pronominal anaphors theymay refer to antecedents that are more widespread in the dialogue,that is, antecedents that are not as recent or as important.Another obvious clue is the presence of reliable boundarymarkers  for different subdialogue types.
Some of these markershave been reported by Grosz (1977), Reichman (1981), and Polanyiand Scha (1983).
The boundary markers found in oursubdialogues should agree with those found in these previousanalyses and extend them.Der ivat ion  of  a dia logue s t ructure  on the  bas iso f  the  task  st ructureAn important prerequisite in the interpretation of user-adviserdialogues is to analyze the task the users are trying to perform.
Atask analysis is a detailed description of the determinants of theuser's behaviors arising from the task context.
The first step inperforming task analysis is to identify the objects involved in thetask.
In our case, these objects are vectors, matrices, rows,columns, variables, variable labels, etc.
The second step is toidentify all the operators in the task which when applied to one ormore objects changes the.
state of the completion of the task.
Inour case, these operators are function calls (e.g.
mean, variance,sort), subsetting values from vectors, listing of values, etc.
Ofcourse, not every operator applies to every object.
A third step isto identify the sequence of operators which would produce adesired state (the goal - e.g.
the problem solved) from an initialstate.
Such a task analysis can be performed at many levels ofabstraction, from high-level conceptual operators to low-levelphysical operators.
The desired level of abstraction depends uponthe level of abstraction of the behaviors that one wants to accountfor.
Usually, the more complex or cognitive the task modelled, themore abstract or coarse the operators elected.
In such case, theoperators will reflect the specifics of the task environment, such as,vectors, matrices, screen, keyboard.
The finer the grain ofanalysis, the more the operators are associated with basic motor,perceptual, or cognitive mechanisms.
Since the task we are tryingto model is quite cognitive in nature - solving statistical problemswith an unfamiliar statistical package - an appropriate level ofanalysis seems to be at the level of the so-called GOMS model(Card, Moran, and Newell, 1983).
GOMS stands for: (1) a set ofCoals; 2) a set of Operators; 3) a set of Methods for achieving thegoals; 4) a set of Selection rules for choosing among competingmethods for goals.In the notation used in our examples, we have used a slightlydifferent terminology and have used the term action instead ofoperator and use the term plan instead of method.
We have alsoused the terms prerequisites, constraints, and meta-plans fromartificial intelligence.
The notion of meta-plans allowed us toaccount for the presence of clarification and acknowledgementsubdialogues (see Litman and Alien, 1984) that could not beaccounted irectly by the task structure.We will now describe how the task structure was used inderiving the dialogue structure.
Goal or plan subordination arisesfrom the plan decomposition i to subplans or from unsatisfiedprerequisites.
In a task structure, plans are composed of otherplans themselves, leading to a hierarchical structure.
In otherwords, a subgoal to a goal can arise from a plan decompositioninto subplans or from the prerequisite conditions which must holdtrue before applying the plan.
Here are the coding decisions usedin deriving the dialogue structure:?
If the user initiated a subdialogue consisting of thestatement of a plan or of a goal, the subdialogue wouldbe "inserted" in the task structure at the location ofthe plan described.?
If the user initiated a subdialogue consisting of thestatement of a subplan within the decomposition of itsparent plan, the subdialogue would be "inserted" inthe appropriate daughter subplan of the parent plan inthe task structure.?
If the user initiated a subdialogue consisting of asubplan arising from an unsatisfied prerequisite of aplan, then the subdialogue would be "inserted" as adaughter of the subdialogue associated with the plan.Clarification subdialogues arise from the restrictions on themeta-p lans  that the participants can use when they cannotachieve one of their plans: In our study, they must ask help to theadviser aloud.
The meta-plan, ASK-ADVISER-HELP, itself hasprerequisites, one of them being that the linguistic communicationbe successful.
This leads to the linguistic clarification subdialoguesthat occur when there are ambiguities in the message that need tobe resolved by requesting disambiguating information from theadviser.
Another consequence of the meta-plan ASK-ADVISER-HELP is the presence of acknowledgement subdlalogueswhereby participants ensure that the communication is successfulby acknowledging that they have understood the message.Let's continue describing the coding scheme:?
The clarification subdialogues are subordinated to thesubdialogue mentioning the concept for whichclarification is requested (e.g., goal, plan, term).?
The acknowledgement subdialogues are subordinated tothe subdialogue mentioning the acknowledged concept.?
The linguistic clarification subdialogues are alsosubordinated to the subdialogue containing theutterance for which clarification is requested.?
Since we are not fully modeling the user's task,subdialogues regarding the participants' behaviors as asubject in a study were ignored.226?
Since knowing the required statistical formula andknowing how to use the console were required to solveall the problems, these prerequisites were not alwaysencoded explicitly in the task structure.
Nevertheless,the clarification and acknowledgement subdialoguesregarding statistics and the use of the console weresubordinated to the subdialogue associated with theplan for which these clarifications were necessary toobtain.DATA COLLECT IONOverv iew of  Data  Co l lect ion  MethodThree novice users had basic knowledge of statistics.
Theyhad to use an unfami l iar  statistical package to solve five simpledescriptive statistics problems.
There were two main restrictionsimposed on the strategies employed to solve the problems: 1) theonly source of information was the adviser; 2) all requests forinformation had to be said aloud.
These restrictions wereconsidered as restrictions on the mcta-plans available to theparticipants when unable to solve the problems.
The participant,the adviser sitting to his/her right, and the console werevideotaped.Cod ing  of  the  D ia loguesEach subdialogue was segmented into subdialogues whichappeared to be the execution of a plan to satisfy a goal of the useror the adviser on the basis of the task structure.In addition to segmenting the dialogue into subdialogues, therelations between subdialogues were determined.
One source ofsuch relations is the decomposition of a total task into subtasks tobe performed in some order.
This decomposition is called the taskstructure (see Grosz, 1977) as described previously.
Twoimportant relations are subord inat ion  and enablement.Consider a dialogue occurring while performing a task, such asbaking a cake, composed of three subtasks, (1) measureingredients, (2) mix ingredients, (3) put the mixed ingredients inthe oven.
Subtasks 1, 2, and 3 are said to be subord inated  tothe task of baking a cake.
Moreover, subtask 2 must precedesubtask 3.
Subtask 2 is said to enable subtask 3.
Thesubdialoguss that would be instrumental to the execution of thesesubtasks would stand in the same relations.However, the decomposition of the task structure was not theonly source of subordination and enablement relations betweensubdialogues.
Clarification and acknowledgement subdialogucseven though they did not correspond to a subtask in the taskstructure were subordinated to the subdialogue introducing theclarified and acknowledged concept respectively.The coder then analyzed the distribution of non-pronominalnoun phrases and pronominal noun phrases throughout thedialogue.
The coder also noted words and phrases occurring at theboundaries of the subdialogues and mapped the distribution of theantecedents of pronominal and non-pronominal naphors.ANALYS IS  OF THE D IALOGUESANALYSIS OF THE USERS' TASKThree main types of subdialogues have been encounteredassociated with each aspect of the task described above :1.
Plan-goal s ta tement  subdlalogues occur when theuser describes a goal, or a plan, or the execution ofactions composing the plan This type of subdialoguemay be an adjunct to the goal or plan becauseexpressing them verbally might not be essential fortheir satisfaction or realization (though expressingthem verbally helps the adviser understand the user).2.
Clarif ication subdialogues occur when the userrequests information from the adviser so that the usercan satisfy a goal.
In this study, these subdialoguesarise from the constraints on the type of meta-plansavailable, ASK-ADVISER-HELP.
There are two maintypes of clarification subdialogues: 1) those concerningthe determination of goals and  plans of the user(e.g., "What  should I do next?
", "How do I access avector?
"); 2) those concerning the arguments  (orobjects) in goals and  plans (e.g., "What  is avector?").
In some cases, the clarification subdialoguesarise from the prerequisite on the recta-plan, that is,assure mutual understanding.
For example, the userwill verify that he/she has identified the correctreferent for an anaphor in the adviser's utterances.3.
Acknowledgement  subdialogues occur when theuser informs the adviser that he/she believes thathe/she has understood an explanation.
They arise fromthe prerequisite on the recta-plan, that is, assuremutual understanding.A small subset of the graphical representation of a simplifiedsubtask structure and of dialogue segmentation and structure isgiven in Figure 1 to show how the task structure partiallyinfluences the dialogue structure.\[TSZ S I DaLOGUE s'rRuCrUACC~l  "~aff'i ; .

Since new subdialogues areassumed to correspond to topic shifts, one can predict that non-pronominal noun phrases will tend to occur more frequently at thebeginning of subdialogues than later in the subdialogues.
On theother hand, pronominal noun phrases play a role in indicating andrealizing topic continuity in a dialogue.
Since new topics areintroduced at the beginning of new subdialogues and developed inthe following sentences, one can predict that pronominal nounphrases will tend to occur more frequently after the first sentencein the subdialogues.
As can be seen in Table 1, there is a cleartrend for the number of non-pronominal noun phrases to decreaseas the subdialogue progresses, especially for the most frequentsubdialoguc lengths (i.e., 2 and 3 sentences), but less marked forthe most infrequent subdialogue lengths (i.e., 4 and 5 sentences).Moreover, there is a clear increase in the number of pronominalnoun phrases from the first sentence to the second sentence in thesubdialogues, though again less reliable for the least frequentsubdialgue lengths (i.e., 4 and 5 sentences).
A complete statisticalanalysis of these data is presented in Guindon, Sladky, Brunner,and Conner (1986).Table 1: DISTRIBUTION OF NOUN PHRASESNON-PRONOMINALNOUN PHP.~n~r  SUBDL~GA)GUELENGTB ~ $ENTF~C~2 3 4 5$1 234 99 30 28$2 114 76 49 21$3 46 30 22$4 29 20$5 11PRONOMINAl, NOUN PHRASE~S?m?~ SUBDIALOGUE LENGTH IN SF.IqI~NCES~mbcr2 3 4 5,S1 13 2 5 0$2 24 15 4 5$3 9 11 2$4 6 4$5 8The observed istributions o?

Because this analysis was performedindependently of the dialogue segmentation and subordination, itis a converging analysis and it supports the derived dialoguestructure on the basis of the task structure and the users' andadviser's plans and goals.
This analysis upports the value of theconcept of a dialogue structure and also support our proposedscheme to derive such dialogue structures.D ISTR IBUT ION OF  THE ANTECEDENTSOF  ANAPHORSThe subdialogues were indexed as shown in Table 2.
Thecurrent subdialogue, labelled N, is the location of the anaphor tobe resolved.
All subdiMogues are indexed relative to the currentsubdialogue N. Thus, the node N-1 immediately dominates N, thenode N-2 dominates N-I, and so on.
The nodes subordinate toeach of the nodes dominating N are indexed beginning with theleft-most node and proceeding rightward.
Thus, if N-1 is the firstnode dominating N, the left-most node subordinate to N-1 will beN-l/L1 and each sibling to the right will be N-l/L2, N-l/L3, etc.N-3 N-3 N-2L1 L2 -2 N ~ -  -N-3 N-3 N 1(L1) I  ( L 1 ) 2 ,  / / ~  L2 ~ ~N-3 N-2 N-2 N-1 N-1( (L i ) l ) l  (L1) I  (L1)2 L1 L2Table 2: INDEXING OF THE SUBDIALOGUESAnaphor ic  - P ronomina l  Noun PhrasesPronominal anaphors are used to refer to discourse ntitiesthat are in focus.
Such entities should be either recent or ofprimary importance in the dialogue, Figure 2 representsgraphically the distribution of the antecedents of pronominal nounphrases with a band, with highest frequencies hown with thewidest bands.
For sake of brevity, the exact frequencies are notreported here but can be found in Guindon, Sladky, Brunner, andConner (1986).Figure z shows that the majority of pronominal antecedentsare located in the current subdialogue, with their frequencydecreasing as distance from the anaphor increases.
The currentsubdialogue contains recent antecedents.
Then, they are mostfrequently found in the parent subdialogue which containsimportant and recent antecedents.
Finally, a few pronominalanaphors (i.e.
it) have their antecedent (i.e., the statisticalpackage) found in the root subdialogue which contains importantantecedents.
Grosz (1977) also observed the use of it to refer to animportant concept that had not been mentioned for manysentences.

?PrunominM Noun Phrase Non-prtmominalNoun PhraseFigure 2: ANTECEDENT DISTRIBUTIONpronominal anaphors: most antecedents are located in the currentsubdialogue or in its immediate superordinate and a fewantecedents co-specifying the main topic(s) of the dialogue arelocated at the root of the dialogue.228These data strongly suggest hat recency plays a role withinthe current subdialogue, but also that another factor must beinvoked to explain the high frequency of antecedents observed inN-1 and in the root subdialogue.
This other factor is topical ityor importance (Guindon, 1985; Kintsch and van Dijk, 1978).A parent subdialogue describes information that is importantto the information described in a subordinate subdialogue.Moreover, the antecedent statistical package was located at the"root" subdiMogue of the dialogue structure.
In other words, itwas one of the most important concepts mentioned in the dialogueand because of its importance stayed in the user's and adviser'sshort-term memory during the complete dialogue and could bereferred to by using a pronoun.
The allocation of short-termmemory during discourse comprehension corresponds to theconcept of attentional state (Grosz and Sidner, 1985) and isdescribed in more detail in Guindon (1985).The task structure and the user's meta-plans correspond to theintentional structure described by Grosz and Sidner (1985).
Notethat the segmentation of the task into subtasks direct thesegmentation of the dialogue into subdialogues and is also adeterminant of focus shifts and the attentional state.
Theantecedent distribution for pronominal anaphors i consistent withthe dialogue structure derived from the user's plans and goals anddescribe principled and psychologically valid constraints on the useof pronominal anaphors over an extended dialogue.
As aconsequence, the validity of the derived dialogue structure isincreased.Anaphor ic  - Non-pronomina l  Def in i te  NounPhrasesSelecting the proper antecedent for a non-pronominal definitenoun phrase anaphor is less difficult than for pronominal anaphorsince more semantic information is provided for matching thedescription of the antecedent.
For this reason we would expect hedistribution for antecedents of non-pronominal definite nounphrases to be far less constrained than the distribution forpronominal noun phrases.
Figure 2 shows that this is the case.Definite noun phrase antecedents range over every dominant nodeN-1 through N-5 and over a few left-branching subordinate nodes.Nevertheless, there is a strong tendency for antecedents to belocally positioned in N and N-1.
Their distribution is consistentwith the derived dialogue structure on the basis of an analysis ofthe task and an analysis of the users' and adviser's plans andgoals.BOUNDARY MARKERSThe analysis of boundary markers revealed reliable indicatorsat the opening of subdialogues in adviser-user dialogues.
This isshown in Table 3.
The determined boundary markers wereconsistent with those found by Grosz (1977), Reichman (1981), andPolanyi and Scha (1983).
The boundary markers can help identifythree major types of subdialogues: I) plan-goal statement; 2)clarification; 3) acknowledgement.
Acknowledgement subdialoguesoccur very frequently at the end of clarification subdialogues, alsoacting as closing boundary markers for clarification subdialogues.A more detailed analysis of the boundary markers is given inGuindon, Sladky, Brunner, and Conner (1986).A small subset of these markers for each type of discourse actis given in Table 3 (the symbol ~ > means optional, "or" isindicated as \[ ( ) ( ) I, and ACTION means an instance from aclass of actions).Subdialogue Types Boundary Markers.

Both analyses are consistent with thederived dialogue structure on the basis of the task structure andthe users' and adviser's plans and goals and they increase thevalidity of the derived dialogue structure.
Both analyses also showthat shifts in focus during discourse comprehension can besignalled in the surface form of the conversants' utterances.
As aconsequence, they can be capitalized upon by natural languageinterfaces.CONCLUSIONThree independent converging analyses upport the dialoguestructure derived on the basis of the task structure and the users'and adviser's plans and goals.
The distribution of the non-pronominal noun phrases hows that they occur more frequently atthe beginning of subdialogues than later in the subdialogues, asshould be expected if non-pronominal noun phrases introduce newentities in the dialogue or reinstate previous ones.
Thedistribution of the pronominal noun phrases how that they occurless frequently in the first sentence than in the second sentence ofthe dialogue, as can be expected if they act as indicator of topiccontinuity.
The distribution of pronominal antecedents shows thatspeakers are sensitive to the organization of a dialogue into ahierarchical structure composed of goal-oriented subdialogues.Antecedents of pronominal noun phrases tend to occur in thecurrent subdialogue, in its parent, or in the root subdialogue.
Inparticular, concepts mentioned in the current subdialogue, itsparent, or in the root subdialogue tend to be in focus.
In the caseof non-pronominM definite noun phrase anaphors, while it ispossible for antecedents o be much more widely spread across thedialogue, they also tend to be located in the current subdialogue orits parent.
As a consequence, it would be possible to restrict andorder the search for the antecedents of pronominal and non-pronominal definite noun phrases on the basis of the type ofdialogue structure exemplified in this paper.
The analysis ofboundary markers reveals reliable and distinctive surface linguisticmarkers for different ypes of subdialogues.229The notion of a dialogue structure based on the task structurehas been empirically supported.
The notion of focusing and itsrelation to the segmentation of the dialogue into subdialogues hasalso been supported, especially by the antecedent distribution ofthe pronominal and non-pronominal noun phrases.
The results ofGuindon (1985) showing different anaphora resolution times fordifferent ypes of anaphors with antecedent in or out of focus alsosupport he refocusing" theories of anaphora resolution.
This givesan impetus to include a model of the dialogue structure and afocusing mechanism in natural language interfaces.
However,much further work has to be done to define precisely how thedialogue structure could be computed from the task structure andthe meta-plans of the conversants and how precisely the anaphoraresolution process would capitalize on this structure.REFERENCESFox, A.B.
