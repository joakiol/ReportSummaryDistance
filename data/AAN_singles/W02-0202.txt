At the Hong KongPolytechnic University, we are attempting todescribe the communicative role of intonation inHong Kong English.
By uncovering the similaritiesand differences of intonation patterns betweennative and Hong Kong speakers of English, wewill be in a position to describe how Hong Kongspeakers make use of intonation to communicatemeanings, and find out whether or not there is asystematic pattern which we can name ?TheIntonation system of Hong Kong English?.
Thefindings will hopefully better inform ourunderstanding of Hong Kong English and help thedevelopment of English language learning andteaching materials directed at discourse intonation.2 Our DataSpoken discourses between native speakers ofEnglish and Hong Kong Chinese have beenrecorded as a first step to build up the Hong KongCorpus of Spoken English (HKCSE).
The HKCSEis divided into four sub-corpora: conversations,business discourses, academic discourses andpublic discourses.
Each sub-corpora consists of 50hours of naturally-occurring discourses.
Theparticipants are monitored in terms of age, gender,nationality, occupation, educational backgroundsand residence overseas.3 The Transcription SystemData collected are first orthographicallytranscribed.
The intonation system proposed byDavid Brazil (1997) known as the Brazil System isbeing used for the prosodic transcription of datamanually.
This is a discourse-based system thatsuits our need of describing Hong Kong intonationalong with discourse features.
Below are the labelsadopted from the Brazil System of intonation:Prominence: Capitalised lettersTone: p (fall), r (fall-rise), p+ (rise-fall), r+(rise), o (level), u (unfinished utterances)Key and termination: hl and ll, stands for highkey /termination andlow key/termina-tionrespectivelyTone unit boundaries: //Prominence refers to the stressed syllables.Tone is the tonic or nucleus in a tone unit (i.e.
thelast prominent syllable of a tone unit), and eitherthe letters are capitalised or underlined, the latter isfor cases in which more stressed syllables followthe tonic.
Key and termination refer to the key ofthe first stressed syllable and the tonic respectively.Philadelphia, July 2002, pp.

Association for Computational Linguistics.Proceedings of the Third SIGdial Workshop on Discourse and Dialogue,A system for computer labelling has also beendeveloped:Fig 1.
Computer speech file of sampleconversation between a male native speaker andmale non-native speakerThe program used for the purpose of computertranscription is ?xwaves?, a package developed as aresearch tool for all kinds of acoustic analysis.
Therecording process is followed by this computerlabelling using Brazil?s paradigm along with theorthographic transcription.
As can be seen from theabove speech file, orthographic transcriptions areput in alternate columns, with the intonationnotations above.
Only the capitalised onset syllable(the first prominent syllable of the tone group) andthe tonic (indicated by p, p+, r, r+ or o) of eachtone unit are inserted.Statistical analysis has also been carried out forpart of the conversation sub-corpus ofconversations:Table 1: Crosstabulation of tones used by nativespeakers (NS) and Hong Kong speakers (NNS)Tone p r p+ r+ o u* TotalNS 308 90 92 142 208 35 875NNS 559 25 24 106 796 43 1543Total 867 105 116 248 1004 78 2418* unfinished utterancesIt can be seen that there is a dominant use ofthe level tone o and proclaiming tone p amongHong Kong speakers of English.
Contrast is alsoseen in the use of the referring tone r between thetwo parties.
Native-speaker data show moreinstances of the referring tone.
Another referringtone r+ has more or less the same frequency ofoccurrence in the two different sets of data.
Allthese will be viewed along with representativeexamples extracted from the data concerned in thesections that follow.4 Description of Tone ChoicesIn Brazil?s (1997) system of native-Englishintonation, R and P stand for the referring and theproclaiming tone respectively.
They are furthersubdivided into r and r+ (for R), and p and p+ (forP).A: What will you do on your day off?B: // r WHEN i?ve prepared my LECture // rif there?s any TIME left // p i shall GO intoTOWN // r and AFter THAT // p it willdePEND on the WEAther // p perHAPS ishall play TENnis// r if its FINE // r and ifthere?s anyone aROUND // r OTHerwise //p i?ll WRITE some LETters // (Brazil1997:73)This example shows the use of a fall-rise r toindicate negotiated information/assumed commonground, and p to signal new information.
Thisstands for the P/R opposition proposed by Brazil(Brazil, 1997).5.
Preliminary FindingsPreliminary results from the conversation sub-corpora show that the level tone is dominant and isused in almost half of the tone units.
Below is atypical example:A: // p WHAT?s the REAson // p for reCORdingus//b: // p YEA // p SHE is DOing a phD PROject //o ON ER // u ENglish // o ER// p TEAching //o in FACT ER // u IT IS ON THE aNAlysisOF THE // p for eXAMple // o converSAtion //o HOW USually ER er CHINESE // p ER theUSE of WORDS // o FOR the ORdinaryconverSAtion // u and THEN THE // o er i ithink it?s MAINly THE // o ER // p ENglishUsage // u MAYBE SHE is GOing TOanaLYSE MY ER // o in ONE SENTENCE //p ER how i STRUCture MY WORDs //At points where the speaker is obviouslysignaling shared information, or informationalready present in the consciousness of the twoparties (e.g.
conversation, ordinary conversation,in one sentence), the speaker uses the level tone oinstead of the referring fall-rise r.The use of proclaiming tone is also dominant.The next example presents us with a series of falls(p):a: // o beCAUSE // r IN PRINciple // p we shouldASK the conTRACtor // p PROjectconTRACtor // p the MAIN conTRACtor // oto DO it// p to TOUCH up ALL THESEFAULTs //The ?contractor?
mentioned in the abovechunks should be understood as already present inthe consciousness of the hearer, for theconversation parties have been discussingconstruction matters.
Subsequent ?contractors?would become old information which should beused with a referring tone according to Brazil.
Buthere they are all said with a proclaiming tone p.5.1 The Intonation of QuestionsIt is claimed by Brazil that when native Englishspeakers echo what they have just heard or ask tohave an assumed common ground confirmed orrefuted, they use either a fall p or a rise r+.
Beloware examples from the Hong Kong English data: (a:Hong Kong male speaker, b: Hong Kong femalespeaker)E (echoing questions)b: // r+ CHANging techNOlogy //a: // p JUST ONCE or TWICE TIMEs //a: // r+ caSIno GROUP //a: // p two DAUGHters // p in UK //b: //r+ not BAD //a: // p you WANT to GET an ANSwer //A (assumed common ground)b: // r+ your GOOD friend //a: // p so you you you will GO as WELL //a: // p OH // r+ you LIKE THIS er // p you LIKEthis //a: // r+ say LIKE er RUSsel STREET //b: // p YOU?re NOT REALly INteresTED inLEAving HONG KONG //a: // r+ IT?S BETter //Preliminary results show that Hong Kongspeakers use both p and r+ in asking questions asnative speakers do.Further, we have examined examples of yes/noquestions and information questions.
This time theP/R opposition in terms of information statuscomes into play.
According to Brazil (1997), p isused when the question content is not yet thenegotiated common ground.
On the other hand, rand r+ are used when the question is put forwardas a presumed assumption.
Some examples of thetranscribed data are as follows (Q stands for?genuine questions?, meaning the speaker is askingfor information unknown to him/her:Q (Information questions including Wh-questions):a: // p HOW to SPEND // r+ toNIGHT // o HOWto SPEND // r+ to SPEND toNIGHT // p HOWto SPEND toNIGHT // (Q)a: // p YEA // o WHAT // p what KIND ofPROblem // (Q)b: // o and you?ll be LEAVing TO // o UK // p asWHEN //b: // o HOW about the overALL // o UM // pPASSing RATE // p for THIS YEAR //Q (Yes/no questions)a: // r+ DO you // r+ DO YOU // o LIKE //r toEAT the INside BODY // p I MEAN the // pAnimal INside BOdy // r+ DO you GET theMEAning //b: // r CAN you suGGEST a CLEver WAY TO //p to FIgure OUT //b: // o BUT UM // o do you MIND if // p weJUST SPEND FIVE or TEN MInutes //b: // o SO // o JACK // p have YOU SEEN THISONE //b: // o HOW aBOUT THE // u ORgaNI- // r+ ASa COMmiTEE MEMber //P: (including declarative mood questions)b: // o is IT BE BEcuase DUE TO the // r+ ALLTHE CRACKS //a: // p and HOW?S GOing with the ONE thatYOU you TALKED about LAST TIME // r+that is the (.)
LIKE er INStitutional BUILdingsis it //a: // r+ WORK DOing IN // r+ DOing FOR // oyou MEAN //b: // r+ your GOOD friend //a: // r+ IT?S BETTER //One point worth noting is the fact that speakerstend to use a fall p more often in Wh-questions.This is in line with Brazil?s (1997) proposal thatthis type of question is asked using a fall becausethe speaker has no idea about the answer.
A rise r+is associated with a considerable number ofquestions that carry presumed assumptions.However, as a general picture, it is not yet clearwhether Hong Kong speakers actually manipulatethe P/R opposition in asking questions as nativespeakers do, since we do have instances of both theP and R tone within the same category of questions.This matter is further complicated by theoverwhelming use of level tones (Please refer totable 1 above) which are frequent in questions aswell:a: // o DO you LIKE CHInese GOOD //a: // o ARE you also WORKING FIVE DAYPER WEEK //b: // u WILL IT AUTO // o AUTOMAtically // oER CAN GO TO THE // o TO THE SOUTHAfriCA CONferENCE //Use of the fall rise r is emphasised particularlyby Brazil (1997) as a means to indicate a presumedcommon ground in asking questions.
But r rarelyoccurs in our Hong-Kong-speaker data.
Theproclaiming tone p and the rising tone r+ are thedominant tones for questions.6 ConclusionPreliminary results suggest that Hong Kongspeakers do use the full variety of tones inspeaking English.
However this pattern of usageseems to differ from that of NS (e.g.
r is muchrarer and the level and proclaiming tones aredominant).
They seem to manipulate the choice inthe same way as native speakers in some of thesub-categories (e.g.
Wh-questions).
However, wehave yet to establish whether Hong Kong speakersmake the same conscious distinction between pand r. NNS?s frequent use of r+ in questions, forexample, may be due to a non-native speakerintuition that a rise is the normal ?question tone?
inEnglish.
Also, if future results reveal that there isan overwhelming use of a fall p and a level o inwhatever situation, then we have no reason tobelieve that there exists a native-like distinction.On top of the main concern regarding whetherHong Kong Chinese speakers deviate from nativespeakers in terms of the use of tones (and if so,how), it will be interesting to investigate alsowhether Hong Kong Chinese speakers havedeveloped a Hong Kong English intonation system.If so, it will better inform us the way to designteaching materials geared towards discourseintonation in English.AcknowledgementsThe work described in this paper was substantiallysupported by a grant from the Research GrantsCouncil of the Hong Kong Special AdministrationRegion (Project No.
