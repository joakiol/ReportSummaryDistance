Proceedings of NAACL HLT 2009: Tutorials, pages 13?14,Boulder, Colorado, June 2009. c?2009 Association for Computational LinguisticsVerbNet overview, extensions, mappings and applications(Karin Kipper Schuler, Anna Korhonen, Susan Brown)Abstract:The goal of this tutorial is to introduce and discuss VerbNet, a broad coverage verb lexiconfreely available on-line.
VerbNet contains explicit syntactic and semantic information for classesof verbs and has mappings to several other widely-used lexical resources, including WordNet,PropBank, and FrameNet.
Since its first release in 2005 VerbNet is being used by a largenumber of researchers as a means of characterizing verbs and verb classes.The first part of the tutorial will include an overview of the original Levin verb classification;introduce the main VerbNet components, such as thematic roles and syntactic and semanticrepresentations, and present a comparison with other available lexical resources.During the second part of the tutorial, we will explore VerbNet extensions (how new classeswere derived and created through manual and semi-automatic processes), and we will presenton-going work on automatic acquisition of Levin-style classes in corpora.
The latter is useful fordomain-adaptation and tuning of VerbNet for real-world applications which require this.The last part of the tutorial will be devoted to discussing the current status of VerbNet;including recent work mapping to other lexical resources, such as PropBank, FrameNet,WordNet, OntoNotes sense groupings, and the Omega ontology.
We will also present changesdesigned to regularize the syntactic frames and to make the naming conventions moretransparent and user friendly.
Finally, we will describe some applications in which VerbNet hasbeen used.Tutorial Outline:VerbNet overview:- Original Levin classes- VerbNet components (roles, syntactic and semantic descriptions)- Related work in lexical resourcesVerbNet extensions:- Manual and semi-automatic extension of VerbNet with new classes- On-going work on automatic acquisition of Levin-style classes in corpora13VerbNet mappings and applications:- Mappings to other resources (PropBank, FrameNet, WordNet, OntoNotes sensegroupings, Omega ontology)- Current status of VerbNet- Ongoing improvements- VerbNet applicationsShort biographical description of the presenters:Karin Kipper SchulerUniversity of Coloradokipper@verbs.colorado.eduKarin Kipper Schuler received her PhD from the Computer Science Department of theUniversity of Pennsylvania.
Her primary research is aimed at the development andevaluation of large-scale computational lexical resources.
During the past couple ofyears she worked for the Mayo Clinic where she was involved in applications related tobio/medical informatics including automatic extraction of named entities and relationsfrom clinical data and development of knowledge models to guide this data extraction.Anna KorhonenUniversity of Cambridgealk23@cam.ac.ukAnna Korhonen received her PhD from the Computer Laboratory of the University ofCambridge in the UK.
Her research focuses mainly on automatic acquisition of lexicalinformation from texts.
She has developed techniques and tools for automatic lexicalacquisition for English and other languages, and has used them to acquire large lexicalresources , extend manually built resources, and help NLP application tasks (e.g.
parsing,word sense disambiguation, information extraction) .
She has applied the techniques todifferent domains (e.g.
biomedical) and has also used them to advance on research inrelated fields (e.g.
cognitive sciences).Susan BrownUniversity of Coloradosusan.brown@colorado.eduSusan Brown is currently a PhD student in Linguistics and Cognitive Science at theUniversity of Colorado under Dr. Martha Palmer?s supervision.
Susan?s research focuseson lexical ambiguity, especially as it pertains to natural language processing tasks.
Herresearch methodologies include psycholinguistic experimentation, corpus study, andannotation analysis.
She has also been involved in the development of large-scalelexical resources and the design and construction of a lexically based ontology.14
