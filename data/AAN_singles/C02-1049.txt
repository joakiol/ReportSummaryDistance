As a result, identifying words isdifficult, because of segmentation ambiguitiesand occurrences of unknown words.Conventionally unknown words were extractedby statistical methods because statisticalmethods are simple and efficient.
However thestatistical methods without using linguisticknowledge suffer the drawbacks of lowprecision and low recall, since character stringswith statistical significance might be phrases orpartial phrases instead of words and lowfrequency new words are hardly identifiable bystatistical methods.
In addition to statisticalinformation, we try to use as much informationas possible, such as morphology, syntax,semantics, and world knowledge.
Theidentification system fully utilizes the contextand content information of unknown words inthe steps of detection process, extraction process,and verification process.
A practical unknownword extraction system was implemented whichonline identifies new words, including lowfrequency new words, with high precision andhigh recall rates.1 IntroductionOne of the most prominent problems incomputer processing of Chinese language isidentification of the word sequences of inputsentences.
There is no blank to mark wordboundaries in Chinese text.
As a result,identifying words is difficult, because ofsegmentation ambiguities and occurrences ofunknown words (i.e.
out-of-vocabulary words).Most papers dealing with the problem of wordsegmentation focus their attention only on theresolution of ambiguous segmentation.
Theproblem of unknown word identification isconsidered more difficult and needs to be furtherinvestigated.
According to an inspection on theSinica corpus (Chen etc., 1996), a 5 millionword Chinese corpus with word segmented, itshows that 3.51% of words are not listed in theCKIP lexicon, a Chinese lexicon with more than80,000 entries.Identifying Chinese unknown words from adocument is difficult; since1.
There is no blank to mark word boundaries;2.
Almost all Chinese characters and words are alsomorphemes;3.
Morphemes are syntactic ambiguous and semanticambiguous;4.
Words with same morpho-syntactic structure mighthave different syntactic categories;5.
No simple rules can enumerate all types of unknownwords;6.
Online identification from a short text is even harder,since low frequency unknown words are notidentifiable by naive statistical methods.It is difficult to identify unknown words in atext since all Chinese characters can either be amorpheme or a word and there are no blank tomark word boundaries.
Therefore without (oreven with) syntactic or semantic checking, it isdifficult to tell whether a character in aparticular context is a part of an unknown wordor whether it stands alone as a word.
Compoundwords and proper names are two major types ofunknown words.
It is not possible to list all ofthe proper names and compounds neither in alexicon nor enumeration by morphological rules.Conventionally unknown words were extractedby statistical methods for statistical methods aresimple and efficient.
However the statisticalmethods without using linguistic knowledgesuffer the drawbacks of low precision and lowrecall.
Because character strings with statisticalsignificance might be phrases or partial phrasesinstead of words and low frequency new wordsare hardly identifiable by statistical methods.Common statistical features for unknownword extraction are mutual information (Church90), entropy (Tung 94), association strength(Smadja 93, Wang 95) and dice coefficients(Smadja 96) etc.
Chang etc.
(Chang etc.
97)iteratively apply the joint character associationmetric, which is derived by integrating abovestatistical features.
Their performance is recallrate:81%, precision rate: 72% in disyllabicunknown word, recall rate:88%, precision rate:39% in trisyllabic unknown word, and recallrate:94%, precision rate: 56% in four-syllabicunknown word.Chang etc.
(1994) used statistical methods toidentify personal names in Chinese text whichachieved a recall rate of 80% and a precisionrate of 90%.
Chen & Lee (1994) usedmorphological rules and contextual informationto identify the names of organizations.
Sinceorganizational names are much more irregularthan personal names in Chinese, they achieved arecall rate of 54.50% and a precision rate of61.79%.
Lin etc.
(1993) made a preliminarystudy of the problem of unknown wordidentification.
They used 17 morphological rulesto recognize regular compounds and a statisticalmodel to deal with irregular unknown words,such as proper names etc.. With this unknownword resolution procedure, an error reductionrate of 78.34% was obtained for the wordsegmentation process.
Since there is no standardreference data, the claimed accuracy rates ofdifferent papers vary due to differentsegmentation standards.
In this paper we use theSinica corpus as a standard reference data.
Asmentioned before, the Sinica corpus is aword-segmented corpus based on the Chineseword segmentation standard for informationprocessing proposed by ROCLING (Huang et al1997).
Therefore it contains both known wordsand unknown words, which are properlysegmented.
The corpus was utilized for thepurposes of training and testing.From the above discussion, it is known thatidentification of unknown words is difficult andneed to adopt different methods in identifyingdifferent types of unknown words.
The objectiveof this research is to find methods to extractunknown words from a document and identifytheir syntactic and semantic categories.Although both processing are interrelated, forlimiting scope of this paper, we will focus ourdiscussion on the extraction process only andleave the topics of syntactic and semanticcategory predictions to other papers.2 Steps to Identify Unknown WordsIn addition to statistical information, we try touse as much information as possible, such asmorphology, syntax, semantics, and worldknowledge, to identify unknown words.
Theidentification system fully utilizes the contextand content information of unknown words ineach three steps of processes, i.e.
detectionprocess, extraction process, and verificationprocess.
The detection process detects theoccurrences of unknown words for betterfocusing, so that on the next step extractionprocess, it needs only focus on the places whereunknown were detected.
In addition, it alsohelps in identifying low frequency unknownwords, which hardly can be identified byconventional statistical extraction methods.
Theextraction process extracts unknown words byapplying morphological rules and statisticalrules to match for different types of unknownwords.
As usual, tradeoff would occur betweenrecall and precision.
Enriching the extractionrules might increase recall rates, but it alsoincreases the ambiguous and false extractionsand thus lowers the precision.
The finalverification process comes to rescue.
It resolvesambiguous and false extractions based on themorphological validity, syntactic validity, andstatistical validity.3 Unknown Word DetectionConventionally a word segmentation processidentifies the words in input text by matchinglexical entries and resolving the ambiguousmatching (Chen & Liu, 1992, Sproat et al 1996).Hence after segmentation process the unknownwords in the text would be incorrectlysegmented into pieces of single character wordor shorter words.
If all occurrences ofmonosyllabic words are considered asmorphemes of unknown words, the recall rate ofthe detection will be about 99%, but theprecision is as low as 13.4% (Chen & Bai, 1998).Hence the complementary problem of unknownword detection is the problem of monosyllabicknown-word detection, i.e.
to remove themonosyllabic known-words as the candidates ofunknown morphemes.
A corpus-based learningmethod is proposed to derive a set of syntacticdiscriminators for monosyllabic words andmonosyllabic morphemes (Chen & Bai, 1998).The following types of rule patterns weregenerated from the training corpus.
Each rulecontains a key token within curly brackets andits contextual tokens without brackets.
For somerules there may be no contextual dependencies.The function of each rule means that in asentence, if a character and its context match thekey token and the contextual tokens of the rulerespectively, this character is a proper word (i.e.not a morpheme of an unknown word).
Forinstance, the rule ?
{Dfa} Vh?
says that acharacter with syntactic category Dfa is a properword, if it follows a word of syntactic categoryVh.Rule type               Example=================================char   {?
}word char  ?
{?
}char word  {?}
?
?category   {T}{category} category {Dfa} Vhcategory {category} Na {Vcl}char category  {?}
VHcategory char  Na {?
}category category char Na Dfa {?
}char category category {?}
Vh T===================================Table1.
Rule types and ExamplesRules of the 10 different types of patternsabove were generated automatically byextracting each instance of monosyllabic wordsin the training corpus.
Every generated rulepattern was checked for applicability andaccuracy.
At the initial stage, 1455633 ruleswere found.
After eliminating the lowapplicability rules, i.e.
frequency less than 3,there are 215817 rules remained.
At next stage,the rules with accuracy greater than 98% areselected for better recall rate.
However theselected rules may subsume each other.
Shorterrule patterns are usually more general than thelonger rules.
A further screening process isapplied to remove the redundant rules.
The finalrule sets contain 45839 rules and were used todetect unknown words in the experiment.
Itachieves the detection rate of 96% and theprecision rates of 60%.
Where detection rate96% means that for 96% of unknown words inthe testing data, at least one of its morphemewas detected as part of unknown word.
Howeverthe boundaries of unknown words are still notknown.
For more detail discussion, see (Chen &Bai 1998).
For convenience, hereafter we use (?
)to mark detected morphemes of unknown wordsand () to mark the words which are not detectedas morphemes of unknown words.4 Unknown Word ExtractionAt detection stages, the contextual rules wereapplied to detect fragments of unknown words,i.e.
monosyllabic morphemes.
The extractionrules will be triggered by the detectedmorphemes only.
The extraction rules arecontext, content, and statistically constrained.Rule-design targets for high recall rate and try tomaintain high precision at the mean time.
It ishard to derive a set of morphological rules,which exactly cover all types of unknown words.Our approach is that if morphological structuresof certain types of unknown words are wellestablished, their fine-grain morphological ruleswill be designed.
Otherwise statistical rules aredesigned without differentiate their extractedword types.
Redundancy is allowed to achievebetter coverage.
Both morphological rules andstatistical rules use context, content andstatistical information in their extraction.4.1  Morphological rulesSince there are too many different types ofunknown words, we cannot go through the detailextraction processes for each different type.
Itwill be exemplified by the personal nameextraction to illustrate the idea of using differentclues in the extraction process.
First of all thecontent information is used, each different typeof unknown words has its own morphologicalstructure.
For instance, a typical Chinesepersonal name starts with a last name andfollowed by a given name.
The set of last namesis about one hundred.
Most of them are commoncharacters.
Given names are usually one or twocharacters and seldom with bad meaning.
Basedon the above structure information of Chinesepersonal names, the name extraction rules aredesigned as shown in Table 2.
Contextinformation is used for verification anddetermining the boundary of the extracted word.For instance, in the last rule of Table 2, it usescontext information and statistical information toresolve ambiguity of the word boundary.
It isillustrated by the following examples.1) after detection   : ?(?)

Rule types of Chinese personal nameIn the examples 1), there are two possiblecandidates of personal names, ??
and ??
?.By context information, the bi-gram (NAME,?)
is less freguent than (NAME, ?)
in thecorpus, so without considering statisticalconstraints, it would suggest that ???
is acorrect extraction instead of ??.
However, thelocality of the keywords is very important cluefor identification, since the keywords of a textare usually unknown words and they are veryfrequently reoccurred in the text.
The statisticalinformation is used here for verification.
Forinstance, if an another sentence which is like ?(?)
?
(?)
?
() ?
() occurs in the samedocument, it suggests ??
is the correctextraction, since the statistical constraintrejects???.
( 1| <??
?documentprob4.2  Statistical RulesIt is well known that keywords often reoccur ina document (Church, 2000) and very possiblethe keywords are also unknown words.Therefore statistical extraction methods utilizethe locality of unknown words.
The idea is thatif two consecutive morphemes are highlyassociated then combine them to form a newword.
Mutual information-like statistics are veryoften adopted in measuring association strengthbetween two morphemes (Church & Merser,1993, Sproat et al 1996).
However such kind ofstatistic does not work well when the samplesize is very limited.
Therefore we propose to usereoccurrence frequency and fan-out numbers tocharacterize words and their boundaries (Chien,1999).
12 statistical rules are derived to extractunknown words.
Each rule is triggered bydetected morphemes and executed in iteration.The boundaries of unknown words might extendduring iteration until no rule could be applied.Following are two examples of statistical rules.Rule id       Pattern          Statistical constraint==========================================R1         Lm(?)

?LmRmPRmLmPLmRmFreqandLmRmPRmLmP==========================================Table 3.
Two examples of statistical rulesThe rule R1 says that Lm and Rm will becombined, if both conditional probabilityP(Lm|Rm)>=0.8 and P(Rm|Lm)>=0.8 hold andthe string LmRm occurred more than once in theprocessed document.
Conditional probabilitiesconstrain the fan-out number on each side ofmorpheme, i.e.
the preceding morpheme of Rmshould almost be limited to Lm only and viceversa.
The threshold value 0.8 is adjustedaccording to the experimental results, whichmeans at least four out of five times thepreceding morpheme of Rm is Lm and viceversa.
However the statistical constraints aremuch loose when the right morpheme Rm is alsoa detected morpheme, as exemplified in R2.
Youmay notice that it also accepts the unknownwords occurred only once in the document.Conventional statistical extraction methodsare simple and efficient.
However if withoutsupporting linguistic evidences the precision ofextraction is still not satisfactory, since a highfrequency character string might be a phrase or apartial phrase instead of a word.
In addition tostatistical constraint, our proposed statisticalmethod requires that a candidate string mustcontain detected morphemes.
In other words, thestatistical rules are triggered by detectedmorphemes only.
Furthermore themorphological structure of extracted unknownword must be valid.
A validation process will becarried out at the different stages for allextracted unknown words.5  VerificationTo verify a correct extraction depends on thefollowing information.1.
Structure validity: the morphological structure of aword should be valid.2.
Syntactic validity: the syntactic context of anidentified new word should be valid.3.
Local consistency: the identified unknown wordsshould satisfy the local statistical constraints, i.e.
noinconsistent extension on the morphological structures.For instance, a new word was identified by the patternrules, but if it violates the statistical constraints, asexemplified in 1), will be rejected.Each extracted candidate will be evaluatedaccording to the validity of above three criteria.For the candidates extracted by the statisticalrules, their structure validity and syntacticvalidity are checked after extraction.
On theother hand, for the unknown words extractedaccording to the morphological rules, theirstructure validity and syntactic validity arechecked at extraction stage and their localstatistical consistency is checked after extraction.To verify the structure validity and syntacticvalidity of the unknown words extracted bystatistical methods, their syntactic categories arepredicted first, since statistical rules do notclassify unknown word types.
The predictionmethod is adopted from (Chen, Bai & Chen,1997).
They use the association strengthbetween morpheme and syntactic category topredict the category of a word.
The accuracy rateis about 80%.
Once the syntactic category of anunknown word is known its contextual bi-gramwill be checked.
If the bi-grams of (precedingword/category, unknown word category) and(unknown word category, followingword/category) are syntactically valid, i.e.
thebi-gram patterns are commonly occurred in thecorpus, the extracted word is considered to be avalid word.
Otherwise this candidate will berejected.5.1  Final SelectionIt is possible that the extracted candidatesconflict each other.
For instance, in thefollowing example, both candidates are valid.???
?, Bennet?
is extracted by name rules and???
?, lawyer-class?
is extracted by suffixrules.name  ==>  ??
??
??
???
?
?An-jan company lawyer Bennett said,suffix  ==>  ??
??
???
?
?
?
?An-jan company lawyer-class is pecial said,The extracted new words will form a wordlattice.
The selection process finds the mostprobable word sequence among word lattice asthe final result.
In the current implementation,we used a very simple heuristics of maximizingthe total weights of words to pick the mostprobable word sequence.
The weight of a wordw is defined to be freq(w)*length(w), wherefreq(w) is the occurrence frequency of w in thedocument and length is the number of charactersin w. For the above example, ???
?, Bennett?occurred 5 times and ???
?, lawyer-class?occurred twice only in the document.
Thereforethe final result is??
??
??
?
?
?An-jan company lawyer Bennett said ,?Bennett, the lawyer of An-jan company, said?
?6  Experimental ResultsIn the current implementation, themorphological rules include the rules forChinese personal names, foreign transliterationnames, and compound nouns.
In addition to themorphological rules, twelve constrainedstatistical rules were implemented to patch theunder coverage of the morphological rules.Although the current implementation is notcomplete, morphological rules of many othertypes of unknown words were not included, suchas rules for compound verbs.
The experimentresults still show that the proposed methodswork well and the morphological rules and thestatistical rules complement each other in theextraction and verification.The Sinica balanced corpus provides themajor training and testing data.
The training datacontains 8268 documents with 4.6 million words.We use it to train the detection rules andmorphological rules.
We randomly pick 100documents from rest of the corpus as the testingdata, which contain 17585 words and 1160unknown word types.A word is considered as an unknown word,if neither it is in the CKIP lexicon nor it isidentified as foreign word (for instance English)or a number.
The CKIP lexicon contains about80000 entries.The precision and recall rates are provided.The target of our approach is to extract unknownwords from a document, so we define ?correctextractions?
as unknown word types correctlyidentified in the document.
The precision andrecall rate formulas are as follows:idocument in  sextractioncorrect  ofnumber NCi =idocumentin    typesrdunknown wo extracted ofnumber NEi =idocumentin    typesrdunknown wo reference ofnumber NRi =?

It counts less than 6%of the total unknown words.Correct# Extract# Precision RecallMorphological rules 541 590 92% 47%Statistical rules 455 583 78% 39%Total system 791 890 89% 68%Table 4.

The performance on the set of unknownwords with frequency <3 in a documentRecall rate of total unknown word types is notvery high, because not all of the morphologicalrules were implemented and some of the wordtokens in the testing data are arguable.
Theexperiment results in Table 6 show that theproposed methods work well on low frequencyunknown word identification.7  Conclusions and Future WorksUnknown word extraction is a very hard task.In addition to statistical information, it requiressupporting knowledge of morphological,syntactic, semantic, word type specific andcommon sense.
One important trend is to lookharder for sources of knowledge and managingknowledge that can support unknown wordidentification.
A word segmented and taggedcorpus is essential for the success of the wholeresearch.
The corpus provides the major trainingand testing data.
It also supports plenty ofunknown words and their contextual data toderive extraction rules.
In this work we aremanaging to use the structure information, thecontext environment, and statistical consistencyof the unknown words and to increase the recalland precision of the extraction process.
Thesyntactic and semantic classifications forunknown words are executed in parallel with theextraction process.
Both classification processesare very hard and need further researches.8  ReferencesChang J. S.,S.D.
