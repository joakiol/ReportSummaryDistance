A Block-Based Robust Dependency Parser for UnrestrictedChinese Text,Ming ZhouMicrosoft Research China,Sigma Centre, 49#, Zhichun Road,100080, Beijing, Chinamingzhou@microsoft.comAbstractAlthough substantial efforts have been madeto parse Chinese, very few have beenpractically used due to incapability ofhandling unrestricted texts.
This paperrealizes a practical system for Chineseparsing by using a hybrid model of phrasestructure partial parsing and dependencyparsing.
This system showed goodperformance and high robustness in parsingunrestricted texts and has been applied in asuccessful machine translation product.IntroductionSubstantial efforts have been made to parsewestern languages uch as English, and manypowerful computational models have beenproposed (Gazdar, et al 1987, Tomita, M, 1986).However, very limited work has been done withChinese.
This is mainly due to the fact that thestructure of the Chinese language is quitedifferent from English.
Therefore thecomputational model in processing English maynot be directly applied to the Chinese language.Lin-Shan Lee et al(1991) proposed a Chinesenatural language processing system with specialconsideration of some typical phenomena ofChinese.
Jinye Zhou et al(1986) presented adeterministic Chinese parsing methodologyusing formal semantics to combine syntactic andsemantic analysis.
However, most of theproposed approaches were realized onsmall-scale lexicon and rule base (usuallythousands words and tens or hundreds rules).
Itis still an open issue whether these models willwork on real texts containing variousungrammatical phenomena.
A parser capable ofhandling real text should have not only largelexicon and big rule base, but also highrobustness in coping with different kinds ofungrammatical phenomena.
Therefore, it isimportant to design a grammar scheme whichnot only is capable of representing the uniquegrammar structures which are different withEnglish, but also qualified of handlingunrestricted text.Phrase structure scheme is usually used inEnglish parsing models to represent sentencestructures, but it is not convenient and not strongenough to express Chinese sentence by phrasestructure in some occasions.
For examples:Sentence-1 ~t~f f \ ] i~~.Fig.
1 phrase structureSOCFig.2 dependency structureI This work was mainly done while the author visited Kodensha Ltd, Japan during 1996.-199978Sentence-1 is a pivot sentence(~gd'f~3), i.e.
"~1~" is not only the object of "i,W" butalsothe subject of " Ik~" .
But this phrase structurecannot indicate the relations clearly as shown inFig.1.
However, the grammar structure isclarified if it is represented in dependencystructure (Fig.
2).
Therefore, it is believed thatdependency grammar sebeme is more suitablethan phrase structure to represent Chinesestructures (Zhou, Huang, 1994).
However,traditional Dependency gammar realizes thedependency relations between any of twospecific words, then numerous word baseddependency knowledge should be constructed,this is a time-consuming task.
Fortunately,knowledge for phrase structure parsing has beenaccumulated for Chinese for many years and itshould be re-used to compensate the lack ofknowledge of word-based ependency parsing.Therefore, to combine the advantages of phrasestructure parsing and dependency parsing, wepropose a new parsing strategy, called"block-based dependency parsing".A "block" means a basic component ofsentence, for example, there are six blocks forsentence 1:\]Another example:Sentence 2: ~:~_12q::~IJ~Af\]i~ ~ ~ ~n~Blocks:\[If~.J2q:\] \[~t~'ff\]\] \ [~\ ]  \ [~ l~:~:~t~: \ ]\]A block represents an information unit incommunications.
For example, inChinese-Japanese machine translation,translations of the members within a block in aChinese sentence usually are in a same blocks inthe Japanese translation.
Furthermore, it is clearto represent block with phrase structure, while itis rather complicated with dependency structure.This block-based ependency parsing processworks like follows.
For an input sentence, basiccomponents of sentence, i.e., "blocks" are firstidentified by an ATN-like partial parsingprocedure, which produces a clear skeleton ofthe sentence structure.
In our phrase structureanalysis, we don't try to deduce the wholesentence into root S, instead, we only try to getthe components, namely blocks.
This partialparsing strategy guarantees high robustness.Then dependency parsing is applied in order tobuild dependency relations among blocks.
Thedependency parsing skips ungrammaticalportions it encounters.
This strategy confinesungrammatical portion and avoids errors to be?
propagated globally.
By partial parsing and skipstrategy, this parser can handle long,complicated, or even faulty sentences.
Theexperiments show that this parser is very robustand powerful.
A parser constructed based on thisapproach has been developed, with 220,000words, 5,000 part-of-speech tagging rules, over1,000 block parsing rules and 300 dependencyparsing rules.
This parser has been applied in aChinese-Japanese machine translation product(Zhou, 1999).
To the author's knowledge, thisparser is one of the largest scale Chinese parserever implemented in the world.The outline of this paper is as follows.
Insection 1, we present our special solution topart-of-speech tagging which significantlyaffects the Chinese parsing.
Section 2 describesin details the block-based ependency parsingapproach.
We then explain the dependencyparsing algorithm in section 3.
The experimentand its analysis are given in section 4.
Theconclusion is given in section 5.1 Rule-based part-of-speech taggingThe Chinese language has many specialsyntactic phenomena substantially different fromEnglish (Chao, 1981; Huang, 1982, Wu and Hou,1982).
One of the biggest problems is that thereis no morphological change for a verb, whetherthe verb functions as the predicate, subject,object, or modifier of a noun.
For instance:vhv r,rl(\[i igCN  V\] NP)Chinese linguistics literature insists that thosewords are verbs, and should be marked as "V ' ,regardless of what context hey are in.
In thissense, there will be phrase structure rules fornoun phrase like:NP->N+VNP->V+N79However, there must be some rules for VP, Slike:S->N+VVP->V+NTherefore the Conflict of rules becomes veryserious.
It means that part-of-speech informationin Chinese is too weak to support Chinesesyntactical analysis.
To solve this problem, wepropose that in the part-of-speech tagging stage,the real grammar features of this kind of wordsare determined directly as N, instead of V. To dothis, we describe all possible word categoryinformation for a word in the lexicon, forexample:~ V/N/F/A//V: verb; N: noun; F: adverb; A: adjectiveA set of rules with comprehensive contextconstraints i designed to determine the specificpart-of-speech of a word in a context.
Forexample:1.
X(NIR~J3(VINIFIA) + X(V*)->~(F) + X(V)2.
~+~(VINIFIA) + X(~) ->~+~f lq )  + X(N)3.
~+~(VINIFIA ) + X(VFN)->~+~J(A ) + X(N)4. iE~+~J3(VINIFIA) + X(~V)->iE:~+~J3(V)X(NIR): a word X, whose word category mayincludes N,R, or others.R: Pronoun;* ?
any part-of-speeches;V* having V category;-V  having no V category;It is ideal if we have a large corpus which hasbeen tagged with thins kind of word categoryinformation, so that we can obtain tagging rulesor obtained n-gram model by training.
However,at present, we can't find a Chinese corpus taggedwith this kind of part-of-speech information asthe training data.
We had to write thepart-of-speech disambiguation rules manually.Currently, over 5,000 linguistics rules have beendesigned.2 Block-based Chinese dependency analysisAs indicated in Fig.
3, block-based ependencyanalysis consists of four modules, i.e., wordsegmentation, part-of-speech tagging, blockanalysis and dependency analysis.
Abi-directional heuristic longest matching methodis applied to decide the optimal word sequence.A set of manually compiled linguistic rules isapplied to decide the optimal word categorysequence.
In a partial parsing process, first, localstructures ( uch as duplication, prefix and suffix)are identified by a set of word formation rules,and proper names are identified by a set ofconstruction rules.
This kind of local structuresare called meta-blocks.
Then frame structures(DP), which have paired starting word andending word, such as "~'"'.
"I~", "~ ' " ' .
"qa"  ete are identified, but its internalstructure analysis is delayed.
Then ATN networkis used to identify the basic blocks, calledlevel-1 blocks (these blocks don't contain IP, LPand DP).
Then we use a set of heuristic rules toidentify the boundaries of IP and LP.
Then ATNnetwork will use again to identify thecomplicated blocks, called level-2 blocks, whichmay contain LP, DP, IP as its components.
Thena sequence of blocks obtained is then transportedto dependency parser, which will generatedependency relations among blocks.
ARer that,we will recursively parse the internal parts of IP,ChineseSentences lw?rsegment-ationpart-of- identifica-speech tiontaggingI T~gesging 1 \[ ATNJ Dependency~ depend- treeencyparsing\] \[ Depe21deenCy \]Fig.

Since the ATN approaches can befound in the literatures (Allen, 1995), we willnot describe this algorithm in details here.
In thenext section, we will focus on a new efficientalgorithm for Chinese dependency parsing.3 Dependency analysisText For an Input: S = blockl, b lock2, .

These kind ofblocks are called "predicate candidates".2) Decide the predicate from these s blocks,denoted as blockj3) If s=0, return; //need not analysis;4)For any case of S, S=1,2,... (S>0),dependency parsing respectively;doA sentence may contain s predicate candidates.For each case, we defined a detailed analysisalgorithm.
Up to now, the parser is designed tohave ability to treat with sentences containing upto 7 predicate candidates.
In case a sentence hasmore than 7 predicate candidates, it will bepartitioned into two parts, and then doinganalysis in turn.Suppose the predicate block is blockj ,  thenumber of "predicate candidates" is denoted as s.We explain the dependency parsing by thefollowing two simple cases.Case 1: s=l?
For all block k before b lock j ,  buildsdependency relations of(b lock k , block~,suB),( b lock k , b lock i,ADv),( b lock k , blocks ,G), ( b lock k , blockj ,TOP);?
For all block k after blocks ,buildsdependency relations of( block k , blocks ,COMP),( block k , b lock i ,OBJl), ( block k , block~ ,OBJ2), etc.Case 2: s=2, Let's say the another predicatecandidate is blockj?
For all block k before blockj ,buildsdependency relations of( b lock k , block~ ,suB), ( block k , blocks ,Ape),(block k ,blockt,G), (b lock k ,blockj ,TOP);For all block k after blockj  ,buildsdependency relations of( b lock k , b lockj  ,COMP),( b lock k , b lockj  ,osJD,(block k ,b lockj  ,OBJ2), etc.?
For blocks between block i and b lock j ,Conducts detailed analysis based on theverb categories of block i and blocky?
Determines the dependency relationbetween blockj and blockj824 ExperimentsA parsing system was implemented andextensive experiments have been performed.The system is written in C and tested onPentium PC.
A total of over 1,000 phrasestructure rules and over 3,00 dependency ruleswere used for block-based parsing.
We built alarge lexicon of 220,000 word entries, with wordcategory information and necessary syntacticaland semantic features.
This approach as beenincorporated as Chinese parsing model in asuccessful commercial Chinese-Japanesemachine translation system J-Beijing (Zhou,1999).This system accepts Chinese text and outputthe parsing result for each sentence.
Each inputsentence is defined as a word string ending withperiod, comma, question mark, semicolon,exclamation mark.We evaluated the parsing result with twocorpus: (~) "primary school textbook ofS ingapore"(~:~l~J~:Jx~),  a corpus consistsof single sentences of modern Chinese,including 1842 sentences, which not only coversmost Chinese sentence types, but also includesvarious of morphological phenomena, such asword duplication, affix, suffix, etc.
(~)Somenews articles collected from People'sDaily(1998,1999,2000).
The sentences are realtext, so there are lots of unknown words (mainlyproper nouns), long sentences, complicatedsentences, ellipsis, etc.
The evaluation results arelisted in table 3.TestcorpusPrimaryschooltextbook,SingaporePeople'sDaily#sentence1842Averagesentencelength(words)7.34Analysisprecision90.4%1400 14.52 67.7%Table 3 Evaluation resultAlthough this model has producedsatisfactory initial results, some naturaldifficulties for the Chinese language still remain,such that further improvement is highly desired.Through mistake analysis, we found that someof main issues affecting the system performanceseriously, as is listed below.1) Word segmentation/~ / ,~fg J~/_k~/o  //~ .~,~/~/~/_1=~/o  /"~l~"  can not only function as single word, butalso function as two words with totally differentmeaning.2) Part-of-speech tagging(1,~,R) (2,~,I) (3,/0IT,R) (4,~J,I) (5.J~.N) (6,~1~~'~.-~,N) (7,~)~,E) (8,fF,V) (9,I~J,E) (10,4~7~,F) (H,~.7~.F) (12,~,V,P)  (13 ,~,N)  (14,~,V,C)(15. ,P)3) Compound nounSince compound nouns cannot exhaustivelynumerated, errors will be inevitable.4) Identification of proper noun(1,~TzI~J~\],N) (2 ,~,V,P)  C3,~.A) :4...-~.,N) (5,~i~,v,c) (6,~,~ (7 ,~,~ (8,,~,~,~5) Syntactical ambiguity(l,~i~.,V,P) (2,an,N) (3,\]~I-----~,N) (4,~{~;,N) (5.//~.V.C) (6jz-~.A.D) (6,'~)~,N) (7,~-~,A) (8,0(f.-~,N)(9,~-~,A) ( IO ,~,N)  (11,o ,P)For pattern of "V+A+N', there are usuallytwo kinds of reduction methods:\[\[V+A\]vp+~ ~.A~/~\[V+\[A+N\]np\] ~ j~z~All of these problems need furtherimprovements in the future.ConclusionIn this paper, a practical Chinese parser ispresented.
The block-based ependency parsingstrategy is a novel integration of phrase structurepartial approach and dependency parsingapproach.
The partial parsing approach anddependency parsing approach can cope with83ungrammatical or faulty, or complicatedsentences, therefore making the system highlyrobust.
Furthermore, our top-down strategy ofidentifying the Chinese special structures uchas frame structures, preposition structures,post-preposition structures produces a simplifiedsentence skeleton, thereby improving theefficiency of parsing.Although this model has shown satisfactoryinitial results, some natural difficulties for theChinese language still remain, and further workwill be needed.
We currently determine the wordcategory by a set of linguistics rules compiled byhuman which limits the precision ofidentification precision.
Therefore, otherapproaches such as statistical approach or somekind of hybrid approach will be adopted in thefuture.
In addition, new methods in handlingambiguous word segmentation, proper noun andcompound noun identification, block analysis,predicate identification and dependency analysiswill be studied.Jingcun Wu, Xuechao Hou, Modem ChineseSyntactical Analysis, Beijing University Press,1982.Zhengsheng Luo, Changiian Sun, Cai Sun (1995), AnApproach to the Recognition of predicated in theautomatic analysis of Chinese sentence patterns,Advances and applications on ComputationalLinguistics, Tsinghua University PressChao, Y.R.
