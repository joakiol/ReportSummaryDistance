PassonneauDepartment of Computer ScienceColumbia UniversityNew York, NY 10027becky@cs.columbia.edu1 In t roduct ionEach utterance of a discourse ither bears a semantic relation to a preceding utterance, or constitutesthe onset of a new semantic unit.
Thus, a critical task in discourse understanding is determining howto relate each new utterance to the current representation f the discourse, Sequences of semanticallyrelated utterances are referred to as segrnents.
The discourse intentions of the speaker provide onebasis for determining which utterances belong within one segment \[Grosz and Sidner, 1986\].
Asdiscussed in \[Passonneau nd Litman, 1993\], we are conducting an empirical study of the relationbetween discourse segments and intentions.
We have estabfished that naive subjects can reliablyidentify the same discourse segment boundaries, using a commonsense notion of speaker intention asthe segmentation criterion.
Briefly, Section 2 describes our study, and Section 3 presents our resultsthat agreement among subjects on discourse segment boundaries is highly statistically significant.Taking these results as a starting point, we ask in Section 4 whether subjects also agree on theintentions they associate with segments.
Exa.mination of our data suggests that subjects do agree onthe semantic labels they associate with segments.
In Section 5 we discuss the question of how relationsamong segments are recognized by looking at a class of cases in which ;m earlier suspended segmentis resumed (i.e., discourse pops).
We hypothesize that in spontaneous oral discourse, relations amongsegments are often not directly signaled, but must be inferred.2 The  StudyOur corpus consists of 20 narrative monologues a,bout tile sa.lue movie (~bout 14,000 words total),taken from Chafe's "Pe;tr Stories" \[Chafe, 1980\].
Seven subjects I)er na.rrative were presented witha verl)a.tim transcript, 1 such that each line of the transcript corresponded to one prosodic phrase(sentence-final or phrase-final contour, see Chafe \[1980\] for details).
Subjects were instructed toidentify sequential chunks, 2 each representing a single intention.
Subjects were also instructed todescribe the speaker intention for each discourse segment.
Intention was explained in common senseterms and by example.
Subjects were restricted to placing boundaries between prosodic phrases.
Anexcerpt from the instructions i shown in Figure 1.Figure 2 illustrates a portion of an intention-based segmentation produced by 7 subjects.

Our pilot study a.~ well ms the work of Rotondo\[1984\] indicated that more COml)lex segmentation ta.sks were too cumbersome given our ;Lverage narrative l ngth.
Hearst\[1993\] also examines linear segmentation, l)~ed on a notion of topic change.60You should think of each movie narrat ion as resulting from many decisions made by the speaker about  what to do next.

At each potential boundary site, i.e., between each pair of prosodic phrases, the numberand identity of subjects who classified the site as a boundary is indicated.
The segmentation shownin Figure 2 contains 1 boundary proposed by all 7 subjects, 1 bounda.ry proposed by 5 subjects, and2 boundaries proposed by 1 suhject.1 SUBJECT (g)13.1 Because hei 's  looking at the girl.1 SUBJECT (f}14.1 \[.75\] {ZERO-PRONOUN~ } Falls over,5 SUBJECTS (a, b, c, d, e)14.2 \[1.5 \[1.35\] uh\] there's no conversation i this movie.15.1 \[.6\] There's sounds,15.2 you know,15.3 like the birds and stuff,15.4 but there., the humans  beings in it don't  say anything.7 SUBJECTS (a, b, c, d, e, f, g)16.1 \[I.0\] Hei falls over,Figure 2: Portion of Segntentation from Narrative 6Subject Annotat ion of Narrat()r's httentionDigression to describe s .uml  trackNo verbal communicat ion \[i.e.,speaker describes lack thereof\]Describes that it is a silent moviewith only nature soundsSpeaker describes ound techniquesused in tnovieExplain that there is no speakingi l l  n lovieFigure 3: Segment spanning 1,1.2 through 15.43 Discourse Segment BoundariesIn \[Passonneau and Litman, 1993\], we show that our subjects agree with one another at levelsthat are statistically significant, thus demonstrating the reliability of intention as a segmentationcriterion.
Percent agreement is defined in \[Gale et al, 1992\] as the ratio of observed agreements withthe majority opinion to possible agreements with the majority opinion.
We use percent agreementto measure the ability of subjects to agree with one anotlter on whether there is ~ segment boundarybetween two adjacent prosodic phrases.
We find that the average agreement across the 20 narrativeson the status of all potential boundary locations is 89% (with a range from 82%-92%).
We then UseCochran's test \[Cochran, 1950\] to deternfine if these levels of agreement are statistically significant.Cochran's test compares the observed number of subjects placing a boundary at every potentialsite with the number predicted by a random distribution; it is aSSulned that the total number ofboundaries assigned by any one subject is given by that subject's actual pertbrmance.
The greaterthe difference from randomness, the more unlikely is the observed istribution.
For the 20 narratives,the probabilities of the observed boundary distributions ranged from p = .1 ?
10 -6 to p < .6 ?
10 -9,all very highly significant.We Mso show why we consider bound~tries agreed upon by a majority of subjects to be empiricallyvalidated.
By partioning Cochran's tatistic, we find the threshold for significance across all subjectsand all narratives to be when at least 4 of 7 subjects agree.
Using this threshohl, we can derive a single61discourse segmentation for each narrative.
For the excerpt in Figure 2, this gives two empiricallyvalidated boundaries, represented as ordered pairs of prosodic phrases: (14.1,14.2) and (15.4,16.1).4 Discourse Segment IntentionThe 5 prosodic phrases from 14.2 through 15.4 constitute a segment, which we represent as \[14.2,15.4\].From Figure 2, we see that 5 different subjects i(lentified exactly this segment.
Inspection of sub-jects' descriptions of speaker intention shows that in such cases of agreement on segments, subjectsalso generally agree on the narrator's intentions for the segment.
Figure 3 presents the intentionsattributed to the narrator by the 5 subjects for \[14.2,15.4\].
The 5 subjects who agreed on the seg-ment (n-e) all indicate that the speaker's intentions pertain to describing the audio characteristicsof the movie.
The other 2 subjects (f,g) included one or two preceding phrases in the segment (of.Figure 2).
Subject f characterized the segment 1)urpose as techniques used in the movie, and thusidentifies essentially the same intentional structure.
Subject g, who began the segment with 13.1,characterized the intention as when the boy falls no one else cares about him.
Subject g thus notonly identifies a different segment boundary, but also a different overall purpose.Presumably, the 5 subjects depicted in Figure 3 abstract from the th.ct that the three full clausesin the segment all refer to auditory characteristics, as signaled by the lexical items conversation ithe first clause, sounds in the second, and say in the third.
Here we have generalized further fromthe subjects annotations to note that each asserts omething about the movie's auditory character.In general, for segments delimited by high agreement I)oundaries, a single formulation of speakerpurl)ose can be generalized from the data provided by the 7 sul)jects.
We believe that such dataprovides evidence that when asked to, subjects perform the same kinds of abstraction across relatedutterances described in \[Polanyi, 1988\] and elsewhere.5 Discourse Segment PopsIn Figure 2, one of tile main characters of tile movie (a boy on a bicycle) is referred to in phrases 13.1and 14.1.
The speaker suspends her description of the boy's activities throughout the next segment(\[14.2,15.4\]), but resumes reference to the boy in the first utterance of the following segment (16.1)using a third person definite pronoun subject (he).
This illustrates a specific class of discourse pops,in which a segment resumes an earlier suspended segment.
In particular, this class of resumptionsegments begins with an utterance in which a third person definite pronoun refers to an entity that isnot in the focus space \[Grosz and Sidner, 1986\] associated with the intervening segment.
Processinga clause that signals this type of discourse pop involves several tasks.
Resolving the prononn in theinitial clause of the resumption seglnent requires shifting the attentional state \[Grosz and Sidner,1986\], since the active focus space (correspon(ling to the intervening segment) does not contain arepresentation of the referent.
This shift depends on recognizing the termination of the interveningsegment, and a continuation relation between the resulni)tion and suspended segments, so that theentities in focus in the suspended segment are again in focus for the resumption segment.There are 8 discourse pops of the type in Figure 2 in the 10 narratives that we have coded forreferential relations (coding described in \[Passonneau, 1993\]).
These 8 examples exhibit variousstructural and semantic relations to the presumed discourse mo(lel.
For example, they containintervening segments that provide more detail, provide general background, or are digressions.
In 7cases, the resumption segment begins with a word that can flmction as a, cue word, 3 but in 4 casesthe cue word is and, a word whose discom'se usage is hard to distinguish and which provides very:~We a.~sume that different uses of cue l)hra~es can be discriminated; cf.
\[Hirschberg and Litman.
1993\].62little semantic inforlnation.
The cue words in the relnaining 3 cases are so, all right and then, noneof which clearly signal attentional change \[Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993\].Non-lexical signals (e.g., uh, tsk, false starts) precede the initial clause of the resumption segmentin 5 cases, and relatively long pauses (> 1.5 see.)
in 6 (cf.
\[Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992\]).
Thissuggests that in spontaneous oral discourse, instead of giving explicit indicators of the structuraland semantic relations among segments, peakers provide non-lexical and pausal cues to breaks insegmental structure, relying on the hearer to infer the abstract structural and semantic relations.For example, the semantics of the I)l'edication fidl over at the onset of the resuml)tion segment isarguably very dissimilar to the predications occurring in the intervening seglnent, possibly supportingthe inference that the new clause is unrelated to the intervening segrnent.
In contrast, the twoclauses which end the suspended segnlent (at 14.1) and begin the resulnption segment (at 16.11are semantically identical and structurally parallel, supporting the inference that 16.1 resuntes thesegment containing 14.1.6 Conc lus ionOur study establishes that a naive notion of speaker intention serves as a reliM)le criterion foridentifying discourse segments.
Qualitative analysis of annotations of speaker intention supportsthe conclusion that where subjects agree on segment boundaries, they also agree on the segment'sintention.
Using the empirically validated seglnents, we can begin to ask specific questions about therelation between segments and their abstract representation in an evolving discourse model.
We notethat for spontaneous oral narrative, discourse pops 1nay not lie explicitly signaled by cue words, andthat structural and semantic relations among distinct segnlents may instead require inference, ht\[Passonneau nd Litman, 1993\], we directly address how explicit devices such as pauses, cue wordsand referential noun phrases correlate with seglnental structure in order to posit constraints betweensurface structure choices and intentional and seglnental structure.References\[Chafe, 1980\] W.
