This paper introduces a newtechnology for collocation extraction in Chinese.Sketch Engine (Kilgarriff et al, 2004) hasproven to be a very effective tool for automaticdescription of lexical information, includingcollocation extraction, based on large-scalecorpus.
The original work of Sketch Engine wasbased on BNC.
We extend Sketch Engine toChinese based on Gigaword corpus from LDC.We discuss the available functions of theprototype Chinese Sketch Engine (CSE) as wellas the robustness of language-independentadaptation of Sketch Engine.
We conclude bydiscussing how Chinese-specific linguisticinformation can be incorporated to improve theCSE prototype.1.
IntroductionThe accessibility to large scale corpora, atone billion words or above, has become both ablessing and a challenge for NLP research.
Howto efficiently use a gargantuan corpus is anurgent issue concerned by both users and corporadesigners.
Adam Kilgarriff et al (2004)developed the Sketch Engine to facilitateefficient use of corpora.
Their claims are twofolded: that genuine linguistic generalizationscan be automatically extracted from a corpuswith simple collocation information providedthat the corpus is large enough; and that such amethodology is easily adaptable for a newlanguage.
The first claim was fully substantiatedwith their work on BNC.
The current paper dealswith the second claim by adapting the SketchEngine to Chinese.2.
Online Chinese Corpora: The State ofthe Arts2.1 Chinese CorporaThe first online tagged Chinese corpus isAcademia Sinica Balanced Corpus of ModernChinese (Sinica Corpus), which has beenweb-accessible since November, 1996.
Thecurrent version contains 5.2028 million words(7.8927 million characters).
The corpus data wascollected between 1990 and 1996 (CKIP,1995/1998).
Two additional Chinese corporawere made available on line in 2003.
The first isthe Sinorama Chinese-English Parallel TextCorpus (Sinorama Corpus).
The SinoramaCorpus is composed of 2,373 parallel texts inboth Chinese and English that were publishedbetween 1976 and 2000.
There are 103,252 pairsof sentences, composed of roughly 3.2 million48English words and 5.3 million Chinesecharacters 1 .
The second one is the modernChinese corpus developed by the Center forChinese Linguistics (CCL Corpus) at PekingUniversity.
It contains eighty-five million(85,398,433) simplified Chinese characterswhich were published after 1919 A.D.2.2 Extracting Linguistic Information fromOnline Chinese Corpora: Tools and InterfacesThe Chinese corpora discussed above areall equipped with an online interface to allowusers to extract linguistic generalizations.
BothSinica Corpus and CCL Corpus offerKWIC-based functions, while Sinorama Corpusgives sentence and paragraph aligned output.2.2.1 String Matching or Word MatchingThe basic unit of query that a corpus allowsdefines the set of information that can beextracted from that corpus.
While there is nodoubt that segmented corpus allows more preciselinguistic generalizations, string-basedcollocation still afford a corpus of the robustnessthat is not restricted by an arbitrary word-list orsegmentation algorithm.
This robustness is ofgreatest value when extracting neologism orsub-lexical collocations.
Since CCL Corpus isnot segmented and tagged, string-based KWIC isits main tool for extracting generalizations.
Thiscomes with the familiar pitfall of word boundaryambiguity.
For instance, a query of ci.yao ???secondary?
may yield the intended result (la), aswell as noise (1b).1a.
?????
?dan zhe shi ci.yao debut this is secondary DE1http://cio.nist.gov/esd/emaildir/lists/mt_list/msg00033.html?But this is secondary?b.
????????
!ta ji ci yao.qiu ta da.fuhe several time ask her answer?He had asked her to answer for several times?Sinica Corpus, on the other hand, is fullysegmented and allows word-basedgeneralizations.
In addition, Sinica Corpus alsoallows wildcards in its search.
Users specify awildcard of arbitrary length (*), or fixed length(?).
This allows search of a class of wordssharing some character strings.2.2.2 Display of Extracted DataFormal restriction on the display ofextracted data also constraints the type ofinformation that can be obtained from thatcorpus.
Sinica Corpus allows users to changewindow size from about 25 to 57 Chinesecharacters.
However, since a Chinese sentencemay be longer than 57 characters, Sinica Corpuscannot guarantee that a full sentence is displayed.CCL Corpus, on the other hand, is able to show afull output sentence, which may be up to 200Chinese characters.
However, it does not displaymore than a full sentence.
Thus it cannot showdiscourse information.
Sinorama Corpus withTOTALrecall interface is most versatile in thisrespect.
Aligned bilingual full sentences areshown with an easy link to the full text.In terms of size and completeness ofextracted data, Sinica Corpus returns all matchedexamples.
However, cut and paste must beperformed for the user to build his/her dataset.CCL Corpus, on the other hand, limits data to500 lines per page, but allows easy download ofoutput data.
Lastly, Sinorama/TOTALrecallprovides choices of 5 to 100 sentences per page.492.2.3 Refining Extracted Information: Filterand SorterBoth Sinica Corpus and CCL corpus allowsusers to process extracted information, usinglinguistic and contextual filter or sorter.
The CCLcorpus requires users to remember the rules,while Sinica Corpus allows users to fill in blanksand/or choose from pull-down menu.
Inparticular, Sinica Corpus allows users to refinetheir generalization by quantitativelycharacterizing the left and right contexts.
Thequantitative sorting functions allowed includeboth word and POS frequency, as well as wordmutual information.2.2.4 Extracting Grammatical InformationAvailability of grammatical informationdepends on corpus annotation.
CCL andSinorama Corpus do not have POS tags.
SinicaCorpus is the only Chinese corpus allowing usersto access an overview of a keyword?s syntacticbehavior.
Users can obtain a list of types anddistribution of the keyword?s syntactic category.In addition, users can find possible collocationsof the keyword from the output of MutualInformation (MI).The most salient grammatical information,such as grammatical functions (subject, object,adjunct etc.)
is beyond the scope of thetraditional corpus interface tools.
Traditionalcorpora rely on the human users to arrive at thesekinds of generalizations.3.
Sketch Engine: A New Corpus-basedapproach to Grammatical InformationSeveral existing linguistically annotatedcorpus of Chinese, e.g.
Penn Chinese Tree Bank(Xia et al, 2000), Sinica Treebank (Chen et al,2003), Proposition Bank (Xue and Palmer, 2003,2005) and Mandarin VerbNet (Wu and Liu,2003), suffer from the same problem.
They areall extremely labor-intensive to build andtypically have a narrow coverage.
In addition,since structural assignment is theory-dependentand abstract, inter-annotator consistency isdifficult to achieve.
Since there is also no generalconsensus on the annotation scheme in ChineseNLP and linguistics, building an effectiveinterface for public use is almost impossible.The Sketch Engine offers an answer to theabove issues.3.1 Initial Implementation and Design of theSketch EngineThe Sketch Engine is a corpus processingsystem developed in 2002 (Kilgarriff andTugwell, 2002; Kilgarriff et al, 2004).
The maincomponents of the Sketch Engine are KWICconcordances, word sketches, grammaticalrelations, and a distributional thesaurus.
In itsfirst implementation, it takes as input basic BNC(British National Corpus, (Leech, 1992)) data:the annotated corpus, as well as list of lemmaswith frequencies.
In other words, the SketchEngine has a relatively low threshold for thecomplexity of input corpus.The Sketch Engine has a versatile querysystem.
Users can restrict their query in anysub-corpus of BNC.
A query string may be aword (with or without POS specification), or aphrasal segment.
A query can also be performedusing Corpus Query Language (CQL).
Theoutput display format can be adjusted, and thedisplayed window of a specific item can befreely expanded left and right.
Most of all, theSketch Engine produces a Word Sketch(Kilgarriff and Tugwell, 2002) that is anautomatically generated grammatical descriptionof a lemma in terms of corpus collocations.
Allitems in each collocation are linked back to theoriginal corpus data.
Hence it is similar to a50Linguistic Knowledge Net anchored by a lexicon(Huang et al, 2001).A Word Sketch is a one-page list of akeyword?s functional distribution and collocationin the corpus.
The functional distributionincludes: subject, object, prepositional object,and modifier.
Its collocations are described by alist of linguistically significant patterns in thelanguage.
Word Sketch uses regular expressionsover POS-tags to formalize rules of collocationpatterns, e.g.
(2) is used to retrieve theverb-object relation in English:2.
1:?V?
?(DET|NUM|ADJ|ADV|N)?
* 2:?N?The expression in (2) says: extract the datacontaining a verb followed by a noun regardlessof how many determiners, numerals, adjectives,adverbs and nouns preceding the noun.
It canextract data containing cook meals and cooking afive-course gala dinner, and cooked the/his/twosurprisingly good meals etc.The Sketch Engine also produces thesauruslists, for an adjective, a noun or a verb, the otherwords most similar to it in their use in thelanguage (Kilgarriff et al 2004).
For instance,the top five synonym candidates for the verb killare shoot (0.249), murder (0.23), injure (0.229),attack (0.223), and die (0.212).2 It also providesdirect links to the Sketch Difference which liststhe similar and different patterns between akeyword and its similar word.
For example, bothkill and murder can occur with objects such aspeople and wife, but murder usually occurs withpersonal proper names and seldom selects animalnouns as complement whereas kill can take fox,whale, dolphin, and guerrilla, etc.
as its object.The Sketch Engine adopts Mutual2 The similarity is measured and ranked adoptingLin?s (1998) mathematics.Information (MI) to measure the salience of acollocation.
Salience data are shown against eachcollocation in Word Sketches and other SketchEngine output.
MI provides a measure of thedegree of association of a given segment withothers.
Pointwise MI, calculated by Equation 3,is what is used in lexical processing to return thedegree of association of two words x and y (acollocation).3.
)()|(log);(xPyxPyxI3.2 Application to Chinese CorpusIn order to show the cross-lingualrobustness of the Sketch Engine as well as topropose a powerful tool for collocationextraction based on a large scale corpus withminimal pre-processing; we constructed ChineseSketch Engine (CSE) by loading the ChineseGigaword to the Sketch Engine (Kilgarriff et al,2005).
The Chinese Gigaword contains about1.12 billion Chinese characters, including 735million characters from Taiwan?s Central NewsAgency, and 380 million characters from China?sXinhua News Agency3.
Before loading ChineseGigaword into Sketch Engine, all the simplifiedcharacters were converted into traditionalcharacters, and the texts were segmented andPOS tagged using the Academia Sinicasegmentation and tagging system (Huang et al,1997).
An array of machine was used to processthe 1.12 million characters, which took over 3days to perform.
All components of the SketchEngine were implemented, includingConcordance, Word Sketch, Thesaurus andSketch Difference.In our initial in-house testing of thisprototype of the Chinese Sketch Engine, it does3http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2003T0951produce the expected results with an easy to useinterface.
For instance, the Chinese Word Sketchcorrectly shows that the most common andsalient object of dai.bu ??
?to arrest?
isxian.fan ??
?suspect?
; the most commonsubject jing.fang ??!?police?
; and the mostcommon modifier dang.chang?
?.The output data of Thesaurus correctlyverify the following set of synonyms from theChinese VerbNet Project: that ren.wei ???tothink?
behaves most like biao.shi ??
?toexpress, to state?
(salience 0.451), while yi.wei??
?to take somebody/something as?
is more likejue.de??
?to feel, think?
(salience 0.488).
Thesynonymous relation can be illustrated by (4) and(5).4a.
????????????????????????????????????
?ta ren.wei dao hai.wai tou.zi you yi ge guan.nianhen zhong.yao, jiu shi yao zhi.dao dang.di deyou.xi gui.ze?He believes that for those investing overseas,there is a very important principle-one must knowthe local rules of the game, and accept them.?b.
?????????????????????????
!zhi.zheng.dang ye biao.shi, you.yu gong.shizheng.yi tai da, kong.pa wu.fa quan.li zhi.chi?The KMT also commented that due to the manycontroversies surrounding PTV, it could notwholeheartedly support it either.?5a.
????????????????????????????
?he.jia.ju jiu ren.wei?
?dian.shi you ji.ben yu.yanhe wen.fa, yao jiang.jiu mai.dian he shi.chang??
?Ho Chia-chu says, "Television has its ownfundamental language and grammar.
You mustconsider selling points and the market."?b.
???????????????????????????????
?ta biao.shi?
?wo xi.wang fuo.jiao.tu neng liao.jie,fu.quan she.hui yu jue.wu de she.hui shi buxiang.he de??
?She says "I hope that followers of Buddhism canrealize that a patriarchal society is incompatiblewith an enlightened society.
"?The above examples show that ren.wei andbiao.shi can take both direct and indirectquotation.
Yi.wei and jue.de, on the other hand,can only be used in reportage and cannotintroduce direct quotation.Distinction between near synonymous pairscan be obtained from Sketch Difference.
Thisfunction is verified with results from Tsai et al?sstudy on gao.xing??
?glad?
and kuai.le??!?happy?
(Tsai et al, 1998).
Gao.xing ?glad?specific patterns include the negative imperativebie?
?don?t?.
It also has a dominant collocationwith the potentiality complement marker de?(e.g.
ta gao.xing de you jiao you tiao ????????
?she was so happy that she cried anddanced?).
In contrast, kuai.le ?happy?
has thespecific collocation with holiday nouns such asqiu.jie ??
?Autumn Festival?.
The SketchDifference result is consistent with the accountthat gao.xing/kuai.le contrast is that inchoativestate vs. homogeneous state.4.
Evaluation and Future DevelopmentsAn important feature of the prototype of theChinese Sketch Engine is that, in order to test therobustness of the Sketch Engine design, theoriginal regular expression patterns were adoptedwith minimal modification for Chinese.
Eventhough both are SVO languages with similarsurface word order, it is obvious that they differsubstantially in terms of assignment ofgrammatical functions.
In addition, the Sinicatagset is different from the BNC tagset and52actually has much richer functional information.These are the two main directions that we willpursue in modification and improvement of theChinese Sketch Engine.4.1 Word Boundary RepresentationWord breaks are not conventionalized inChinese texts.
This poses a challenge in Chineselanguage processing.
The Chinese Sketch Engineinserted space after segmentation, which helps tovisualize words.
In the future, it will be trivial toallow the conventional alternative of no wordboundary markups.
However, it will not be trivialto implement fuzzy function to allow searchesfor non-canonical lemmas (i.e.
lemmas that aresegmented differently from the standard corpus).4.2 Sub-Corpora ComparisonThe Chinese Gigaword corpus is markedwith two different genres, story and non-story.
Astill more salient sub-corpus demarcation is theone between Mainland China corpus and Taiwancorpus.
Sketch Difference between lemmas formtwo sub-corpora is being planned.
This wouldallow future comparative studies and would havewide applications in the localization adaptationsof language related applications.4.3 Collating Frequency Information withPOSOne of the convenient features of SketchEngine that a frequency ranked word list islinked to all major components.
This allows avery easy and informative reference.
Sincecross-categorical derivation with zeromorphology is dominant in Chinese, it wouldhelp the processing greatly if POS information isadded to the word list.
Adding such informationwould also open the possibility of accessing thePOS ranked frequency information.4.5 Fine-tuning Collocation PatternsThe Sketch Engine relies on collocationpatterns, such as (2) above, to extractcollocations.
The regular expression formatallows fast processing of large scale corpora withgood results.
However, these patterns can befine-tuned for better results.
We give VNcollocates with object function as example here.In (6), verbs are underlined with a single line,and the collocated nouns identified by EnglishWord Sketch are underlined with double lines.Other nominal objects that the Sketch Enginemisses are marked with a dotted line.6.a.
In addition to encouraging kids to ask, think anddo, parents need to be tolerant and appreciative toavoid killing a child's creative sense.b.
Children are taught to love their parents,classmates, animals, nature .
.
.
.
in fact they aretaught to love just about everything except tolove China, their mother country.c.
For example, the government deliberately chosenot to teach Chinese history and culture, norcivics, in the schools.d.
At the game there will be a lottery drawing for amotorcycle!
And perhaps you'll catch a foul ballor a home run.The sentences in (6) show that the current SketchEngine tend to only identify the first object whenthere are multiple objects.
The resultantdistributional information thus obtained will bevalid given a sufficiently large corpus.
However,if the collocation patterns are fine-tuned to allowtreatment of coordination, richer and moreprecise information can be extracted.A regular expression collocation patternalso runs the risk of mis-classification.
Forinstance, speech act verbs often allow subject tooccur in post-verbal positions, and intransitive53verbs can often take temporal nouns inpost-verbal positions too.7.
a.
?you can say goodbye to your competitivecareer.b.
`No,' said Scarlet, `but then I don't notice much.'8.
a.
Where did you sleep last night?b.
?it arrived Thursday morning.c.
From Arty's room came the sound of anaccordion.9.
`I'll look forward to that.'
`So will I.
'Such non-canonical word orders are even moreprevalent in Chinese.
Chinese objects often occurin pre-verbal positions in various pre-posingconstructions, such as topicalization.10.
??????????
?quan.gu mian.bao, chi le hen jian.kangwhole-grain bread, eat LE very healthy?Eating whole-grain bread is very healthy.?11a.
?????????????????
?you ren chang.shi yao jiang zhe he.hua fen.lei,que yue fen yue leisomeone try to JIANG the lotus classify, but moreclassify more tired?People have tried to decide what category thelotus belongs in, but have found the efforttaxing.?b.
?????????
?wo yi.ding yao ba lao.da chu.diaoI must want BA the oldest (son) get rid of?I really want to get rid of the older son.
?When objects are pre-posed, they tend to staycloser to the verb than the subject.
Adding objectmarking information, such as ba?, jiang?, lian?
would help correctly identify collocatingpre-posed objects.
However, for those unmarkedpre-posed structures, closeness to the verb maynot provide sufficient information.
Several ruleswill need to be implemented jointly.The above example underlines a criticalissue.
That is, whether relative position alone isenough to identify positional information.
TheSketch Engine is in essence a powerful toolextracting generalizations from annotated corpusdata.
We have shown that it can extract usefulgrammatical information with POS tag alone.
Ifthe corpus is tagged with richer annotation, theSketch Engine should be able to extract evenricher information.The Sinica Corpus tagset adapts to the factthat Chinese has a freer word order than Englishby incorporating semantic information with thegrammatical category.
For instance, locationaland temporal nouns, proper nouns, and commonnouns each are assigned a different tag.
Verbs aresub-categorized according to activity andtransitivity.
Such information is not available inthe BNC tagset and hence not used in theoriginal Sketch Engine design.
We will enrich thecollocation patterns with the annotated linguisticinformation from the Sinica Corpus tagset.
Inparticular, we are converting ICG lexicalsubcategorization frames (Chen and Huang 1990)to Sketch Engine collocation patters.
These ICGframes, called Basic Patterns and AdjunctPatterns, have already been fully annotatedlexically and tested on the Sinica Corpus.
Weexpect their incorporation to improve ChineseSketch Engine results markedly.6.
ConclusionIn this paper, we introduce a powerful toolfor extraction of collocation information fromlarge scale corpora.
Our adaptation proved thecross-lingual robustness of the Sketch Engine.
Inparticular, we show the robustness of the SketchEngine by achieving better results throughfine-tuning of the collocation patterns viaintegrating available grammatical knowledge.54ReferencesChen, Keh-Jiann and Huang, Chu-Ren.
