The paper summarizes an ongoing investiga-tion of the discourse planning tasks concerned with the se-quencing of utterances and their parts.
Content selectionprovides some important constraints on sequencing, mostnotably those derived from the preconditions and effects ofplanning operators.
However these operators underconstralnsequencing, especially below the granularity at which theyinterface with a domain knowledge source.
Further con-straints are available from the integrative processes of theheaxer or reader and from working memory \]imlts.
Applica-tion of these constraints i a matter for discourse planningbecause the choices relate to one's communicative goals.
Theplanning task is one of translating functionally relevant re-lationships between units to be ordered into ordering con-straints.
A collection of strstegies for this task are presented.Some of the strategies were used in an earlier implementedsystem; many are justified by prior psycholinguistic research.Also discussed include current efforts to extend the work tofocus structure in general, and to address the handling ofconflicts between strategies.In t roduct ionThe extent o which the components of a text or utter-ance succeed in carrying out their intended function de-pends in part on the sequence in which they are realized.For example, a critical aspect of understanding an ex-planation is to integrate the concepts and propositionsin the explanation with existing knowledge.
Sequenc-ing decisions hould attempt o facilitate this integra-tion and otherwise nhance the intended functionalityof the segments of the explanation.
Superficially, the"sequential structure = of discourse is simply the orderin which its elements are positioned in a linear medium.However, some of the ordering may be arbitrary.
In atheoretical analysis, it is more useful to define the se-quent ia l  s t ruc ture  of discourse as a partial orderingthat has specific justifications.
This paper provides acollection of such justifications in the form of strate-gies for translating functionally significant relationshipsbetween discourse lements into palrwise ordering I con-straints between those elements.We begin with a discussion of the nature of the se-1 "Ordering" and "sequencing" are used interchangeably.quencing task and the advantages of explicit operatorsfor this task.
A number of strategies for the coher-ent ordering of an explanation are then presented, someof which were used in an earlier implemented system\[Suthers 1993a\], and many of which are justified byprior psycholinguistic research.
Directions for furtherresearch are also discussed, including current efforts toextend the work to focus structure in general (i.e., sub-ordination structure as well as sequential structure),and to address the handling of conflicts between strate-gies (e.g., between centering theory and McKeown's fo-cus preferences).Approaches  to  the  Sequenc ing  TaskPrevious work in generation has handled sequencing de-cisions in a number of ways.
Schematic approaches spec-ify allowable orderings implicitly in terms of the tran-sitions of finite state automata \[McKeown 1985\].
Non-determinism in these automata has been addressed us-ing focus preferences for selecting from a content pool,these preferences being embodied in a selection mecha-nism.
Other approaches exploited the structure of do-main knowledge with mechanisms for traversing datastructures representing this knowledge \[Paris & McK-eown 1986, Sibun 1992\].
Planning approaches initiallyutilized more local yet still schematic specifications ofordering, expressed as preconditions or optional satel-lites for plan operators \[Cawsey 1989, Hovy 1988, Moore1989\].
More recently, partial order causal ink (POCL)planning is being applied to discourse planning, withpartial ordering derived in a principled manner from therelationships between preconditions and postconditionsof plan steps \[Young et gl.
1994\].Content selection processes provide some importantconstraints on sequential structure, most notably in theform of satisfaction-precedence relations derived fromthe preconditions and effects of discourse planning op-erators.
However these processes underconstraln se-quential structure.
This is especially true below thegranularity at which the operators interface with a do-main knowledge source, because the latter is partiallyresponsible for providing collections of related contentthat can't be specified by domain-independent opera.tors.
For example, a specification that some distinguish-297th International Generation Workshop ?
Kennebunkport, Maine * June 21-24, 1994ing attributes of an entity should be expressed mightbind to several nonexclusive alternatives, or a specifl-cation for a description of the constituents of an ob-ject or process might result in retrieval of a collectionof propositions.
Some sequencing decisions above thegranularity of access to domain knowledge may be un-derconstrained aswell, for example the order in whichto express a list of multiple reasons for a conclusion.Further constraints are available, for example from rea-soning about the integrative processes of the hearer orreader and the impact of working memory limits onthese processes.
Application of these constraints i amatter for discourse planning because the choices relateto one's communicative goals, as discussed below.
Se-quential structure is too important to treat arbitrarilyand too context-sensitive to treat in a schematic man-ner.Overall, ordering heuristics have not typically beenmade explicit as causally efficacious plan operators.
Ex-plicit ordering operators facilitate the expression andstudy of alternate theories of sequential structure, andhave benefits for planning as well.
For example, theyenable a p|A=~er to tell whether it can achieve a com-municative goal by ordering its utterances in a certainway, and they provide a handle for changing strategiesin different discourse situations.
Suthers \[1993a\] treatedsequencing as a distinct planning task and used sequenc-ing operators that derived ordering constraints from rel-evant relationships between the elements being ordered.However, prior planning approaches (including that justcited) have not made the effects of ordering decisions ex-plicit.
Effects can help choose between conflicting oper-ators, and must be considered in reasoning about whatcommunicative goals are achieved by particular order-ings.Choice Between Confl icting Operators.
Whenordering operators conflict, the operators express prin-cipled reasons for choosing between alternate sequentialstructures.
The choice is a matter for discourse planningbecause it relates to one's goals.
The intended effectsof conflicting ordering operators can he used to selectbetween them provided that these effects can be relatedto contextual factors such as superordinate goals andstylistic preferences \[DiMarco & Hirst 1993, McCoy &Cheng 1991, Hovy 1990\].
For example, a common con-~ict is between a sequential structure that makes a sin-gle entity salient and a sequential structure that flowssmoothly from one entity to another (~dovetailing~).Entity salience might be preferred when the entity inquestion is a topic of the current segment, while dove-tailing might be preferred when communicating a re-lational structure among equally important entities orto make a transition to a new topic.
(A definition of~topic ~is forthcoming.)
Or consider the ordering of ex-amples with respect o the generality they exemplify.
Ifthe examples are presented first, the reader has an op-portunity to engage in inductive inference towards thegenerality, yet may fail to see the relevance of the ex-amples.
Presented after a generality, examples provideconcrete instances under which the generality may beindexed.
The choice depends on whether the speakeror writer is trying to get the hearer or reader to engagein active induction or trying to ease the comprehensionprocess.Achieving Communicat ive Goals by SequentialStructure.
Some planners (e.g., POCL planners) cannotice when a goal can be achieved by actions that havealready been planned.
However, these planners can onlytake advantage ofexisting actions when the explicit ef-fects of a single action meets the goal in question.
Itshould be possible to extend these planners to use or-dering operators in an opportunistic manner to identifyways in which goals can be achieved by feIicltous or-dering of multiple actions, e.g., to achieve communica~rive goals by implicit relations \[Lascarides & Oberlander1992, Mann & Thompson 1983\].
If an operator's effectmatches to an active unsatisfied goal and the opera~tor's constraints match existing utterance componentsor planning can satisfy these constraints with new utter-ances, then mere installation of the ordering constraintcan be used to achieve the communicative gc~al.
Forexample, suppose a discourse planner has the goals ofdescribing a number of events and the causal relationsbetween them.
Communication f the causal relationsmight be achieved implicitly by describing the events intheir causal order.Sequencing as Exploit ing Relationships.
The se-quencing of two elements of a discourse can only bedecided if there exists some relationship between theelements which has implications for their order of ex-pression.
The sequencing task is relational, not merelyselective.
Approaches that treat sequencing as a se-lective task, for example by using predicates that se-lect the most preferred element out of a set of remain-ing candidates, are forced to generate a full ordering(the sequence of selected items).
The structural as-pects of sequencing are not a natural consequence ofthe model.
When sequencing is treated as the accumu-lation of explicit constraints between elements, partialorderings can be constructed.
Derivation of these con-straints from relationships between the elements to beordered addresses the structural aspect of sequencingdirectly.The remainder of this paper will present a number ofsequencing strategies that illustrate how relationships307th Intemational Generation Workshop ?
Kennebunkport, Maine * June 21-24, 1994between elements yield sequencing constraints.
But firstsome notational preliminaries are required.Notat ion  fo r  Order ing  S t ra teg iesTwo aspects of sequential structure are distinguished:precedence and juxtaposition.
Precedence indicatesthat one segment should occur sometime before anothersegment.
Precedence is significant when prior commu-nication of the contents of one segment facilitate theintended functionality of the contents of another seg-ment.
For example, in technical writing definitions ofterms usually precede their use.
Juxtapos i t ion indi-cates that one segment should occur nest to anothersegment in the sequential realization of the explana-tion.
Juxtaposition is significant when the contents ofboth segments must be in focus of attention at the sametime in order for the segments to fulfill their intendedcommunicative function.
For example, statements ofsimilarity and difference are usually juxtaposed whenmaking a comparison so that the relative significanceof the similarities and differences can be weighed.
Anyconstraint on sequential structure must involve one ofprecedence or juxtaposition.
Succession indicates thesimultaneous presence of both constraints (i.e., that onesegment should occur immediately before and ~ezt toanother segment).Sequential constraints are placed between text planelements at three granularities.
Inter- lntent lonalconstraints are placed between intentions to performrhetorical and communicative acts \[Suthers 1993a\],and constrain the ordering of the utterance segmentsthat achieve these intentions.
For example, an inter-intentional constraint would be used to ensure that adescription of the structure of a device precede an ac-count of how the device carries out its function.
Inter-proposit ional  constraints are placed between proposi-tions and constrain the ordering of sentences, adjectives,relative clauses, and other surface realizations of thepropositions.
For example, an inter-propositlonal prece-dence constraint between (Parallel plates-l) and (Made-of plates-1 metal-l) would allow any of "parallel metalplates," Uparal|el plates made of metal" or "The platesare parallel.
The plates are made of metal."
but not"metal parallel plates," metal plates that are parallel,"or ~The plates are made of metal.
The plates are paral-lel."
(Clearly, this constraint leaves other realization de-cisions open.)
Intra-proposlt ional  constraints, placedbetween roles of a proposition, controls voice (i.e., whichrole filler is expressed as the subject of a clause).
~ Forexample, an intra-propositional precedence constraint2I.u the implemented system of Sut\]aers \[1993a\], subjects werealways surface-initial.
Subject and su.rface-inltial re not con-fiatecl in forthco~.ing revisions.could select between C'The plates are made of metal."vs.
"Metal is what the plates are made of."
Juxta-position constraints between role fillers discourage theinsertion of a subordinate clause between the realizationof the role fillers.The ordering strategies areexpressed in the form ofrules for translating other kinds of relationships intoordering relations.
The general form of the rules is:If $1 bears relation R to $2 then 51 ~'~ $2where $1 and $2 are segments and S, ~'~ $2 is one ofthe following:$1 ~ $2 for precedence ($1 occurs sometime befores2),$1 \]~,=t $2 for juxtaposition ($1 and 52 are next toeach other in either order), and$1 suc~ 52 for succession ($1 and $2 are juxtaposedand $1 precedes $2).Propositions are denoted by (P rl r2 *) where P is apredicate, the ri are role fillers, and * denotes 0or moreadditional role fillers.
No ordering of rl, r2, and ?
isimplied by this notation; in particular ?
may representother ole fillers that can be expressed before or betweenrl and r~ as well as after them.
The notation for intra-propositional ordering is(P r, =d - ~  1, 2 *).This constrains the realizations of the fillers of rl andr~ to be sequenced in a manner especting relation ord.~re~ For example, if (P r, r2) is expressed as a clause,then rl will be the surface-initial subject, sTwo predicates and a function are needed to expresssome of the ordering strategies:End-p(P) ,  true when P is a proposition at the end ofa chain of ordered propositions:p~ ~'~ ...P. ~'~ p.Toplc-p(t), true when t is the argument of or a con-stituent of the argument of a rhetorical goal scopingover the propositions to be ordered.

)Table 1 lists the strategies.
Selected strategies are dis-cussed below.Supp lementa l  Const ra in tsThe most obvious constraints on sequential structureare those derived from the inclusion of supplementalmaterial.
Supplemental material facilitates the under-standing or acceptance of other segments of an ex-planation in specific ways, the success of which is of-ten affected by order of presentation.
Suthers \[1993a\]used a collection of supplemental  relations, these be-ing Urhetorical" relations that are primarily intentionalrather than informational \[Moore & Pollack 1992\] andin which one can pre-identify a "nucleus" that is moreessential to the goals of the discourse than the other re-lata.
Ordering strategies are associated with each sup-plemental relation in Table 1.
Some relations give rise toan unambiguous ordering, and thus have only one rulein the table.
The ordering implications of others arecomplicated by possible differences in tutorial strategyand individual differences in learning style.
One advan-tage of separating ordering decisions from supplementalrelationships i  the ability to model stylistic differencesby changing ordering strategies independently of sup-plemental strategies.Background.
Background material is that whichfunctions to enable the comprehenaion f nuclear fore-ground material.
Thus background functions best if itprecedes the foreground.
Succession is not necessary aslong as the delay between background and foregroundis small enough that the background will not have beenforgotten when the foreground is encountered.327th International Generation Workshop ?

June 21-24, 1994Exemplif ication.
Strategic variation is possible inthe ordering of examples and illustrations.
An explainercan encourage a questioner to engage in inductive in-ference by giving examples before the generalizationsor concepts that they exemplify, as expressed by theE ~-e~ G constraint of version b of the rule.
Alternately,the example can be given immediately after the con-cept or generalization being exemplified, as expressedby the G ,~ef E constraint of version a.
Under thisstrategy, the questioner does not have to guess the gen-eralization and will appreciate why the example was in-troduced.
When multiple examples are present otherordering strategies are available for inter-exemplar o -dering: see Mittal & Paris \[1993\] and Rissla~d \[1978\].Motivation.
A motivation segment is intended topoint out the utility of another segment of an expla-nation so that the hearer will appreciate the relevanceof the motivated segment enough to take it seriously.Motivation to attend doesn't work retroactively, sothemotivating segment should occur prior to the motivatedsegment.
Succession is preferred, but not necessary.Previews and Summaries.
By definition, a previewprecedes the main body of an explanation.
To serve thefunction of preparing the questioner for the sequenceof utterances to follow, a previewed text should be theimmediate successor of the preview, because a previewsets up an expectation that the subsequent segmentswill be those mentioned in the preview.
Violation of thisexpectation with intervening material can cause confu-sion.
A summary is similar to a preview in that bothprovide skeletal characterization f the main body of anexplanation, though summaries can refer back to con-tent that was not available at the time of a preview.The pedagogical utility of a summary is in repetitionand consolidation.
Succession is not as important forsummaries.
In fact, a summary might be used becausethere is some extra material between the segments re-lated by the summary relation: the summary functionsto refocus on the main points after the digression.Memory and Processing ConstraintsThe ordering operators of this section rely on a few pro-cessing assumptions that have been supported in thepsycholinguistic l terature.
Memory (retention and re-trieval) is better for "integrated" items, i.e.
those thatthe subject can relate to other prior knowledge \[Keenanet al 1984, Kintsch & van Dijk 1978\].
New integrativelinks are constructed in a limited working memory dur-ing comprehension \[Kintsch & van Dijk 1978\].
There isa cost (allocation of attention, probability of error) asso-ciated with changing the contents of this working mere-ory, and the longer an item is kept in working memorythe more likely it is to be encoded in long term mem-ory.
Finally, subjects attempt to identify thematicallycentral entities and use these as the default locus ofintegration when attempting to integrate new material\[Carpenter & Just 1977\].Comments on "topic" and "theme" may be helpfulat this point.
Lavid & Hovy (unpublished working pa-per) define "theme" as "that element that informs thelistener as discourse unfolds how to relate the incom-ing information to what is already known."
The topicpredicate isnot intended as a generally applicable defini-tion of thematic elements outside its use in the orderingrules.
It merely provides candidates for being made the-matic dements though appropriate ordering and otherdevices.When a questioner asks a question, the topics of thequery are brought into the focus of attention.
Their fo-cal status motivates the relevance of assertions madeand concepts introduced by the explainer in the re-sponse.
If assertions or concepts that had no apparentrelation to the topics were introduced, the questionermight be unable to integrate them and could becomeconfused ue to the conversational implicature of theapparent change in subject.
For example:"What killed the dinosaurs?
""Many rocks at the KT-boundary have an un-usual concentration f iridium ...(The iridium poisoned tltemf The speakerdoesn't want to talk about dinosaur dentisef)"In contrast, the following explanation changes focus ofattention from the question's topic to other conceptsand propositions in a well connected manner:"The dinosaur extinctions may have beencaused by a huge meteorite.
Evidence for sucha meteorite is provided by an unusual con-centration of iridium found in KT-boundaryrocks .
.
.
.
"This example illustrates the next three rules: the re-sponse starts with a proposition about the topic, thetopic is in the subject position, and new concepts areintroduced by their relation to prior concepts.Topic Init ial  and Topic as Subject.
The "topicinitial" rule specifies that propositions involving a topicentity t are to be expressed before propositions not in-volving a topic.
As illustrated above, in situations wherethe topic has been pre-identified, this rule ensures con-tinuity with the recipient's expectations.
In other situ-ations, first-mention aids the subject's identification ofthe topic \[Kieras & Boviar 1981, Gernsbacher & Harg-reaves 1988\], helping to ensure that facts about a partic-ular entity among the many mentioned are remembered.337th International Generation Workshop * Kennebunkport, Maine * June 21-24, 1994The "topic as subject" rule marks the topic as thesurface-initial subject of any clause it occurs in.
Repe-tition in the subject position is another way to facilitatethe bearer's or reader's identification ofthe topic \[Kieras& Boviar 1981\].
This rule can also help smooth over vi-olations of the following "dovetailing" rule by returningto a concept hat is presumably easy to reactivate.Dovetail ing.
This strategy relies on a combinationof "argument overlap" \[Kintsch & van Dijk 1978\] and"given-new" \[Haviland & Clark 1974\].
The inter-propositional P1 ,~,c~ P2 constraint introduces a propo-sition P2 when it involves concept or proposition thathas been brought into immediate focus of attention byanother ordering decision to express P1 (i.e., there is ar-gument overlap).
The intra-propositional y ~re?
, z con-straint makes the surface-initial subject of each propo-sition be the role flUer by which it was introduced (i.e.,proceeds from given to new).
Dovetailing is intendedto minimize working memory changes and maintainthe connectedness of the subject's evolving conceptualmodel or "text base.
"Dovetailing can be iterated on z in P2 to producechains.
However, overapplication of dovetailing risksobtaining stream-of-consciousness t xts which lack the-matic development.
Topic salience and dovetailing canbe in conflict.
One manifestation of this conflict isthe conflict between McKeown's \[1985\] preference of"change" over "maintain" over "return" in order toavoid having to reintroduce entities one has more to sayabout (based on Sidner \[1979\]) and Gordon et a/'s \[1993\]preference of "continuing" over "retaining" over "shift-ing" in order to maintain local coherence.
Further workis required to identify how the choice of one strategyover the other depends on register and task demands,and to examine the interaction with other factors uchas location in the discourse.
For example, the authorexpects that topic salience will be preferred in contextswhere the theme is being established (e.g., early in adocument, paragraph, or other new discourse segment)while dovetailing might be preferred once the theme isestablished and a transition to a subordinate theme isneeded.Domain Knowledge ConstraintsNow we consider constraints derived from relationshipsin the domain knowledge being expressed.Natura l  Orderings.
Temporal and causal relationsare normally experienced in a particular direction, forexample from prior to posterior events or from cause toeffect.
The assumption that our cognitive apparatus iadapted to more easily use these relations in the ~for-ward" direction suggests that predicates categorized as"natural orderings" \[Bienkowski 1986\] be expressed withthe prior event or cause as the subject, for example ``Xcaused y" is preferred to "y is caused by z," all otherthings being equal.
This strategy isconsistent with psy-cholingulstic evidence indicating that reverse causal andtemporal ordering inhibits comprehension \[Irwin 1980\]and disrupts thematic processing \[Townsend 1983\].
Italso facilitates the hearer's identification of implicitlyexpressed temporal relations \[Lascarides & Oberlander1992\].
Related strategies are available for spatial de-scriptions \[Linde 1974, Sibun 1992\].Differentia nd Context.
The "differentia" relationholds between two propositions when one proposition(P s .)
differentiates a ubclass from other subclassesof a class c. An explainer chooses the statement (P s *)from amongst all the possible predicates one could applyto s because P distinguishes s from the other subdivi-sions of e that the questioner might know about.
Thequestioner cannot recognize or assess this significanceof (P s *) unless he or she has been informed of the"contrast class" against which the claim (P s *) is be-ing made.
This rule suggests that the contrast class cbe introduced first, for example:"An electric field is a kind of force field thatapplies a force to a charged object.
"is preferred overUAn electric field applies a force to a chargedobject and is a kind of force field.
"Mere precedence is insufficient because the genus pro-vides the context in which the differentia is meaning-ful.
Succession places them both in focus of attentionat once.
This strategy can be generalized to the levelof sibling communicative acts or rhetorical intentions\[Suthers 1993a\], and to other context/statement rela-tionships, as suggested by the "Context" rule in Table 1.
"Epistemic Context" ConstraintsSuthers \[1993a,b\] discusses how the "epistemic context"(the knowledge available to the explainer and questionerand the knowledge shared in prior dialogue) influencesthe choice between alternate domain models on whichto base an explanation.
Some of the "preferences" pre-sented in these publications address equential concerns.For example, when preferences to "say something new,""minimize new propositions," and "elaborate on focalmodels" are applied together in a dialogue about somephenomenon, incremental construction of increasinglyelaborate domain models of the phenomenon will result\[Suthers eta/.
1992\].
In general, the epistemic ontext347th International Generation Workshop * Kennebunkport, Maine * June 21-24, 1994provides important constraints on sequential structureacross multiple xchanges but has less impact on se-quential structure within a single utterance.
This pa-per does not discuss constraints across exchanges.
Onlyone constraint originating in assumptions about hearerfamiliarity is discussed.FAm;llar First.
New concepts can be introduced inrelation to familiar ones using any domain relation.Suppose concept f is familiar and n is new.
Thenany proposition (P f n .)
will do the job, providedthe predicate P itself is familiar.
(An unfamiliar pred-icate won't be much help in integrating an unfamiliarconcept.)
The strategy assumes an ordering of famil-iarity levels.
If f is more familiar than n, it installsan intra-propositional constraint that fl should be ex-pressed surface-initial, yielding expressions of form "Fis P-related to n." (not "n is P-X-related to .f').
Oncefamiliar-first has been applied, dovetailing can be usedto introduce other unfamiliar concepts.The assumption behind familiar-first is that it is eas-ier to retrieve s known concept and integrate a newconcept in relation to it than it is to construct a newconcept from scratch and subsequently retrieve a knownconcept o which it can be integrated.
However, at andbelow the clause level the delay between the introduc-tion of r~ and f may be so small that this strategy doesnot have a discernible ffect.
Also, if n is a topic, "topicas subject" may be more relevant to the speaker's goals.These are questions for empirical work.C los ing  CommentsThe sequencing of expository texts and speech shouldbe chosen to enhance the intended functionality ofeachtextual unit and to facilitate the questioner's integra-tion of the communicated information.
This aspect ofthe planning task is usefully seen as one of translat-ing functionally relevant relationships between textualunits into ordering constraints.
The strategies presentedin this paper were derived from examination of exam-ple explanations and found to be necessary to enable anautomated explanation generator to produce coherentlysequenced explanations \[Suthers 1993a\].
(Space con-straints necessitate l aving a full example to the workjust cited.)
Many of the strategies were subsequentlyfound to correspond to results in the psycholinguisticliterature.As discussed previously, the strategies can conflict.Suthers \[1993a\] handled conflicts with a simple pref-erence ordering.
This approach is inadequate becauseconflict resolution is expected to depend on contextualfactors such as the speaker or writer's goals and the re-lationships of the elements to be ordered with respectto discourse segment boundaries.
The author is cur-rently planning psycholinguistic experiments o test theimpact of the strategies through reading time and re-call studies, with particular concern for how the resolu-tion of conflicts between topic salience and other heuris-tics should be sensitive to discourse context.
Anotherquestion for future work is the extent o which the se-quencing task fits top-down models of planning such asDPOCL \[Young eta/.
1994\] vs. requiring s distinctmechanism for the application of conflicting heuristics.The modeling of working memory limits and memorydecay in DPOCL operators would require generalizingthe POCL notion of a %hreat" to be a matter of de-gree rather than absolute.
The author suspects thatimportant generalities will be easier to capture if fac-tored out and expressed as explicit sequencing operatorsrather than manifested in variations of multiple decom-positional operators.The foregoing work is being extended to include thesubordination structure Of an utterance as well as itssequential structure.
"Focus trees" \[McCoy & Cheng1991, Hovy & MCCoy 1989\] will be used to represent thecombined sequential nd subordination structure, withpartial orderings placed between siblings at each level ofthe hierarchy.
The nodes of a focus tree represent unitsof a text at various granularities ranging from inten-tionally defined segments of the sort discussed by Grosz& Sidner \[1986\] down through clausal propositions topredicates and entity references.
"Focusing operators,"including versions of the sequencing heuristics of this pa-per rewritten in the focus tree notation, wiU manipulatethe tree structure by subordinating one or more subtreeto another or by installing cross-links between siblingsto constrain possible traversals.
This reformulation isexpected to be an improvement for several reasons.
Itallows the expression of heuristics for the subordina-tion aspects of focus structure, not just sequencing, andthematic development can take place at multiple gran-ularities.
Only one ordering relation, precedence, is re-quired.
Juxtaposition is handled by grouping withina subordinate structure rather than by a different or-dering relation that requires pecial interpretation.
Anavailability metric can be defined in terms of distanceto search back through the tree.
Finally, the notationcan be used in the analysis of texts, and promises tosupport application of the sequencing heuristics to textrevision as well as text generation.AcknowledgementsThis research was conducted while supported by grantMDR-9155715 from the National Science Foundation Ap-plications of Advanced Technology program.
