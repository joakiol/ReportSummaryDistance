Julia HirschbergAT&T Bell LaboratoriesMurray Hill, New Jersey 07974Comparing the questions -proposed for this discourse panel with those identified for the TINLAP-2panel eight years ago, it becomes clear that some progress has been made in discourse studies.While TINLAP-2's questions eem concerned with identifying an ideal model of discourse (e.g.,what constitutes an appropriate model of discourse, how domain-dependent must such models be,what makes discourse coherent, and how can relationships between utterances best be character-ized), TINLAP-3's questions reflect the debates which have attended individual attempts to definesuch models (e.g., are current discourse theories testable, are plan-based theories really feasible,how are processing theories defined and what have their authors failed to take into account, andwhat aspects of discourse study are really subsumed by more general problems of general commun-ication or knowledge representation).
However, in one area -- the role of speech in discourseresearch -- the questions posed at TINLAP-3 appear remarkably similar to those posed atTINLAP-2: essentially, do we need to study speech as well as text to study discourse?
While asimple 'yes' is probably no more controversial now than it would have been in 1978, I think we canmake an even stronger claim today: that while one may still study text in silence, one cannot studydiscourse without taking speech into account.Before providing support for this claim, I should admit to some bias.
For the past two and one-half years I have been interested in intonation and its contribution to utterance and discourseinterpretation.
It is significant hat, for much of this time, this was more of a hobby than a profes-sional interest: both in Linguistics and in Natural Language Processing, intonation has commonlybeen seen as 'the edge of language'.
More recently, however, this attitude seems to be changing --witness the speech session at ACL86, for example.
I think much of the reason for this change inNLP arises from the fact that the study of spoken language promises to help overcome critical obs-tacles to progress in better-established areas of the field.881.
Speaker IntentionsFirst, prosody provides help in identifying speaker intentions.
It is now widely accepted that thecontour or tune a speaker employs in an utterance can communicate semantic or pragmatic infor-mation.
However, since there are few particular tune types for which we can specify with any con-fidence just what the meaning might be, it has been difficult to generalize about what type of infor-mation tunes in general can convey.
But from those whose 'meaning' is better understood --namely, declarative, yes-frO "question, surprise~redundancy, rise-fall-rise, and continuation rise con-tours -- it seems (Hirschberg & Pierrehumbert 1986) that tunes convey two sorts of inforation:first, propositional attitudes the speaker wishes to associate with an utterance and, second, speakercommitment to some structural relationship holding between utterances.
In the first case, thespeaker may convey via choice of tune that s/he knows x, believes x, does not believe x, is uncer-tain about x, or is ignorant of x.
Consider 'I'm the Easter Bunny.'
intoned declaratively, interro-gatively, incredulously, or with rise-fall-rise, for example.
In the second case, tunes can conveyspeaker commitment to some intentional relationship holding between utterances.
We have pro-posed that continuation rise, for example, can convey that a subordination relationship holdsbetween the (interpretation of a) phrase uttered with continuation rise (a) and the succeeding utter-ance (b), which we gloss informally as 'b completes a'.Intonational contours also provide information about speaker intentions by helping to distinguishbetween direct and indirect speech acts (Sag & Liberman 1975).
'Can you read the bottom line?
'when uttered with a declarative pattern is more likely to be taken as an indirect request han whenit is uttered with yes-no question intonation.
Furthermore, when 'can' and 'you' are deaecented,the indirect request interpretation appears even more favored.2.
Semantico-Syntactie DisambiguationAt an even more basic level, accent and phrasing can affect utterance interpretation by helpinghearers disambiguate among potential syntactic parses (Marcus & Hindle 1985) or logical forms.89For example, when 'only' associates with intonational focus in an utterance, varying the focussed(stressed) element can affect the truth conditions of the underlying sentence (Rooth 1985).
Con-sider: 'Bill only INTRODUCED Mary to John.'
(He didn't do anything else); 'Bill only introducedMARY to John' (He didn't introduce anyone else to John); and 'Bill only introduced Mary toJOHN' (He didn't introduce Mary to anyone else).
Phrasing can similarly influence hearers'interpretation f the scope of negation.
Compare 'John doesn't drink because he's unhappy.'
(Johndrinks for some other reason) with 'John doesn't drink, because he's unhappy.'
(John is toounhappy to drink).
It also appears that some form of intonational boundary in otherwise ambigu-ous conjoined structures can influence disambiguation: If there is a boundary between 'old' and'men', for example, in 'old men and women', it appears more likely that 'old' will modify theentire conjunct; if there is a boundary between 'men' and the conjunction, this interpretation is lesslikely.
Finally, phrasing, accent, and pauses may distinguish metalinguistic disjunction from truedisjunction (Ball 1986).
'Nominate George or the person you most admire.'
may propose a choiceof nominees or convey that George is admired by the hearer, depending upon intonational cues.While speakers do not always provide intonational cues in cases such as these, and while suchcues, when provided, frequently do not force one interpretation over another, theories of syntaxand semantics cannot afford to ignore them.3.
Information StatusIt is commonly accepted in linguistic pragmatics that so-called 'contrastive stress', or accent, canindicate an item's information status (Chafe 1976, Schmerling 1976).
In 'John hit BILL', 'Bill'probably represents 'new' information; whereas in 'JOHN hit Bill', John does.
In addition, theaccenting of prowords can alter reference resolution: Consider 'John hit Bill and then HE hitHIM.'
or compare 'John called Bill a Republican and then he insulted him' with 'John called Bill aRepublican and then HE insulted HIM'.
While, in the first and third sentences, referents to enti-ties clearly not new information are in fact accented, the simple association of given informationwith deaccented items and new with accented can be salvaged by postulating that position in9Opredicate-argument structure is also information subject to the given/new distinction.
The pro-nouns in the first sentence, for example, can be accented to indicate that they represent new instan-tiations of the arguments to 'hit', distinguishing 'hit(HE\[Bill\],HIM\[John\])' from 'hit(John,Bill)'.However, if one is trying to construct a general theory of appropriate accenting -- say, for spokentext generation -- the simple association of old or given information with deaccented items and newwith accented is not so easily retained.
In particular, choice of overall tune appears to influencefelicity of accenting of old information.4.
Discourse StructureFinally, there are several ~vays in which intonational features can indicate the structure of adiscourse.
Diane Litman and I have been looking at the relationship between so-called 'clue'words and phrases 1 and their 'non-clue' uses.
Recently, we have been studying the intonationaldistinction between clue and non-clue uses.
From a pilot study of 'now' in natural speech, ~e havefound that clue uses can often be distinguished by the following characteristics: they usuallyrepresent separate intonational phrases, they are generally accented, and they frequently are givenlow accents.
Non-clue uses are frequently deaccented and rarely represent fuU intonationalphrases.
We are also comparing the examining the interaction between the use of clue words tosignal discourse structure and other cues, such as pitch range manipulation.Janet Pierrehumbert and I have proposed (Hirschberg & Pierrehumbert 1986) that speakers canmanipulate pitch range and final lowering ratios to signal the topic structure of a discourse.
Whenspeakers increase their pitch range, they can signal various degrees of topic change~ they can returnto a prior topic level by return to a roughly similar pitch range.
Similarly, degree of final loweringin an utterance can be used to signal the 'level' of topic which that utterance concludes; maximumfinal lowering signals the conclusion of major topics, for example.
In both cases, of course, it isI.
Words and phrase such as 'now', 'anyway', 'by the way', which can signal the structure of a discourse.
See (Reichman1985, Cohen 1983).91the relationship of pitch ranges and final lowering ratios employed, rather than any absolutevalues, that is at issue.
While we developed these hypotheses in the course of synthesizingprepared text, 2 we are currently testing them empirically by presenting subjects with ambiguousanaphora resolution tasks which can be disambiguated according to the perceived structure of thediscourse.
Other pilot studies under way 3 also report encouraging results on the role of pitchrange, final lowering, speech rate, and pausal duration in perceived iscourse structure.$.
Some ConclusionsSo, intonational studies provides a fertile field for researchers in many areas of NLP by suggestingpotentially simpler answers to questions uch as how hearers recognize and communicate discoursestructure, relational predication, goals, and speech acts.
To date we have only begun to explorewhat prosody can convey.
Since better tools are currently available for speech analysis and syn-thesis, it is to be hoped that more.
researchers will join in the task.
Speech synthesizers like Dec-talk, Prose, and the Bell Labs Text-to-Speech system allow us to vary intonational features in aprincipled way to examine what sounds bad as well as what sounds good.
The commercial vaila-bility of such synthesizers makes it quite possible that the end result of a text generation systemcan be spoken.
Software for the analysis of natural speech (pitch trackers and wave form editors,for example) is faster and more precise, allowing us to examine intonational contours and measuredurations of natural data and of speech elicited during empirical studies.Despite this increased accessibility of tools for speech research, it does seem likely that studies ofintonation and discourse will proceed more rapidly if they are interdisciplinary in nature.
We neednot become phonologists or psychologists o work in this field, but we have a golden opportunitynow to collaborate toward common ends.
Furthermore, the empirical tradition in speech studiesmakes it imperative that our hypotheses be tested rigorously before they are incorporated into2.

In conclusion, it is rela-tively easy now to take the position that prosody presents information crucial to NL generation andunderstanding.
However, the consequences of taking this position, the need for interdisciplinarycollaboration and for empirical testing, may be more controversial -- and will increase the magni-tude of the task.93REFERENCESBall, C. N. 1986.
