However, Ara-bic Question Answering is still not in themainstream.
The challenges of the Arabiclanguage and the lack of resources havemade it difficult to provide Arabic QA sys-tems with high accuracy.
While low accu-racies may be accepted for general purposesystems, it is critical in some fields such asreligious affairs.
Therefore, there is a needfor specialized accurate systems that targetthese critical fields.
In this paper, we pro-pose Al-Bayan, a new Arabic QA systemspecialized for the Holy Quran.
The sys-tem accepts an Arabic question about theQuran, retrieves the most relevant Quranverses, then extracts the passage that con-tains the answer from the Quran and itsinterpretation books (Tafseer).
Evaluationresults on a collected dataset show that theoverall system can achieve 85% accuracyusing the top-3 results.1 IntroductionNowadays, the Web has become the main sourceof information where lots of terabytes of data areadded every day in all fields.
With this increaseof data on the Web, there is a critical need for ad-vanced search facilities that satisfy users?
demandswith high accuracy.
This leads to several problems:the first problem is that most of the available searchengines provide users with documents that are rel-evant to their demands; however, the users shouldtake the trouble of searching for the answers in-side each document.
This increased the need forQuestion Answering (QA) systems that provide theusers with direct answers to their questions.
Whilegreat efforts have been made to provide reliable QAsystems for different languages, very few attemptshave been made to investigate QA for the Arabiclanguage.The second problem is the quality of the data.The development of social networks made the usersnot only encouraged to search on the Web but alsoto post their opinions and knowledge.
Althoughthis is an advantage for sharing knowledge in differ-ent fields and massively increasing the data on theWeb, it is critical for religious affairs where usersmay post untrusted or false information.
Observ-ing the Arabic Web, we found that this problemis very common for the Holy Quran, where largeamount of incorrect data is published on differentsites which may provide a spurious view of theIslamic religion.The third problem is the challenges of the Ara-bic language.
Arabic is highly inflectional andderivational, which makes its morphological anal-ysis a complex task.
Derivational: where all theArabic words have a three or four characters rootverbs.
Inflectional: where each word consistsof a root and zero or more affixes (prefix, infix,suffix).
Arabic is characterized by diacriticalmarks (short vowels), the same word with dif-ferent diacritics can express different meanings.Diacritics are usually omitted which causes ambi-guity.
Absence of capital letters in Arabic is anobstacle against accurate named entities recogni-tion.
Finally, the lack of Arabic resources, suchas corpora, makes Arabic NLP research more chal-lenging.In this paper, we propose our solutions to theseproblems.
We introduce Al-Bayan: a new Ara-57bic QA system specialized for the Quran.
Al-Bayan aims at understanding the semantics of theQuran and answering users questions using reliableQuranic resources.
Mainly, we use the Quran andits interpretation books (Tafseer) of trusted Quranicscholars as our sources of information.
Our maincontribution can be summarized in the followingpoints:1.
Building a Semantic Information Retrievalmodule that retrieves the semantically relatedverses to user?s questions.2.
Increasing the accuracy of question analysisby applying a highly accurate Arabic tool formorphological analysis and disambiguationand by using a state of the art classifier, i.e.Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classifyquestions.3.
Extracting the ranked answers to the inputquestions from the retrieved verses and theirinterpretation with high accuracy.The rest of the paper is organized as follows:Section 2 shows some of the work related to oursystem.
Section 3 shows the details of the systemmodel.
Section 4 shows the datasets that we usedto build the system.
In Section 5, we show some ofthe initial results.
Finally, we conclude the paperand give directions to future work in Section 6.2 Related WorkOur work is related to prior work in both Quranicresearch and Question Answering systems.
(a) Quranic Research: Several studies havebeen made to understand the Quranic text and ex-tract knowledge from it using computational lin-guistics.
Saad et al.
(2009) proposed a simplemethodology for automatic extraction of conceptsbased on the Quran in order to build an ontology.
In(Saad et al., 2010), they developed a framework forautomated generation of Islamic knowledge con-crete concepts that exist in the holy Quran.
Qurany(Abbas, 2009) builds a Quran corpus augmentedwith a conceptual ontology, taken from a recog-nized expert source ?Mushaf Al Tajweed?.
QuranicArabic Corpus (Atwell et al., 2011) also builds aQuranic ontology of concepts based on the knowl-edge contained in traditional sources of Quranicanalysis, including the sayings of the prophetMuhammad (PBUH), and the Tafseer books.
Khanet al.
(2013) developed a simple ontology for theQuran based on living creatures including animalsand birds that are mentioned in the Quran in orderto provide Quranic semantic search.
AlMaayah etal.
(2014) proposed to develop a WordNet for theQuran by building semantic connections betweenwords in order to achieve a better understandingof the meanings of the Quranic words using tradi-tional Arabic dictionaries and a Quran ontology.Other attempts for text-mining the Quran wereproposed such as: QurAna (Sharaf and Atwell,2012) which is a corpus of the Quran annotatedwith pronominal anaphora and QurSim (Sharaf andAtwell, 2012) which is another corpus for extract-ing the relations between Quran verses.b) Question Answering (QA) Systems: Al-though a large number of QA systems were pro-posed for the English language such as the workproposed by Fleischman et al.
(2003), Ittycheriahand Roukos (2006), Kaisser (2012), the ArabicQA research is still limited in terms of accuracy.Some Arabic systems have been proposed suchas: QARAB (Hammo et al., 2002) which is a QAsystem that takes factoid Arabic questions and at-tempts to provide short answers.
ArabiQA (Bena-jiba et al., 2007) which is fully oriented to the mod-ern Arabic language.
It also answers factoid ques-tions using Named Entity Recognition.
However,this system is not completed yet.
DefArabicQA(Trigui et al., 2010) presents a definitional QA sys-tem for the Arabic language.
Arabic QA4MRE(Trigui et al., 2012) introduced the Arabic languagefor the first time at CLEF.
This system proposeda new approach which can answer questions withmultiple answer choices from short Arabic texts.However, its overall accuracy is 0.19.
Also, allthese systems target the modern standard Arabic.To the best of our knowledge, no previous researchwas proposed for the Quranic classical Arabic ques-tion answering.3 System ModelAl-Bayan system architecture is shown in Figure1.
The input question passes mainly through threestages.
The first stage is Question Analysis, wherethe input question is preprocessed and classified toget the expected answer type.
The preprocessedquestion then enters the second stage, Informa-tion Retrieval.
In this stage, the semantically rele-vant verses are retrieved using offline preprocessedQuranic data.
Finally, the expected answer typeand the retrieved verses are fed to the Answer Ex-58QuestionClassificationQuestionpreprocessing Retrieve theversescontainingthe answerInformation RetrievalQuestionAnalysis Extract theanswerAnswerExtractionArabic NERQuestion AnswerOffline PreprocessingQuranic OntologyOfflineOnlineQuran Verses Weighted Vector of Concepts of Each VerseFigure 1: System Architecturetraction module which extracts the answer from theobtained verses and their Tafseer using a set of fea-tures.
We first present the preprocessing operationsthat are used in online and offline phases.
Then, wepresent the different modules of the system.3.1 Preprocessing OperationsText preprocessing is done by applying morpho-logical analysis to identify the structure of textsuch as: morphemes, roots, affixes, stems, partof speech (POS) tags, etc.
The Arabic languageis, morphologically, one of the most complex andrich languages.
Moreover, the Quranic Arabic ismorphologically more complex, since each wordmay have more that one meaning and a word mayhave more than one POS tag.
Also, the Arabictext of the Quran is fully diacritized, while mostof the questions are written without diacritics.
Forpreprocessing, we used MADA (MorphologicalAnalysis and Disambiguation for Arabic) (Habashet al., 2009) which is one of the most accurate Ara-bic preprocessing toolkits.
MADA can derive ex-tensive morphological and contextual informationfrom raw Arabic text, and then use this informationfor high-accuracy part-of-speech tagging, diacriti-zation, lemmatization, disambiguation, stemming,and glossing in one step.
Each term in the inputtext will be represented by its stem and POS tag, inthe following format (stem:POS) using Buckwaltertransliteration (Buckwalter, 2002).
We remove pro-nouns, prepositions, conjunctions and other POStypes, since these words are stopwords and mustnot affect the information retrieval indexing.
Inour system, we apply MADA preprocessing in twodifferent phases: on the Quran and its Tafseer inthe offline phase, and on the input question in theonline phase.3.2 Question AnalysisThe system first takes the Arabic question which ispreprocessed to extract the query that will be usedin the Information Retrieval module.
The questionis also classified to get the type of the question,and consequently the type of its expected answer,which will then be used in the Answer Extractionmodule.3.2.1 Question PreprocessingThe preprocessing operations discussed in Section3.1 are applied to the input question.
The prepro-cessed question is represented by a vector of termswhere each term consists of a stem and a POS tag.3.2.2 Question ClassificationWe classify the question to the anticipated type ofthe answer.
This information would narrow downthe search space to identify the correct answer.
Themost straight forward question classification is theRule-based approach; where a set of rules is usedto derive the answer type (for example: the answerof Who/Whom is of type person).
The derivationof expected answer types is often carried out bymeans of machine learning approaches, such as thework of Li and Roth (2002).
This task relies onthree parts: taxonomy of answer types into whichquestions are to be classified, a corpus of questionsprepared with the correct answer type classification,and an algorithm that learns to make the actual pre-dictions given this corpus.
We use an SVM classi-fier for this purpose and construct its training data.We also introduce a new taxonomy built speciallyfor our system.
More details about our dataset andtaxonomy are mentioned in Section 4.Unlike Rule-based classifies, our SVM classifiercan classify questions in which the question wordis omitted.
For example the two questions: (Wheredid Allah talk to Moses?)
and (What is the nameof the mountain at which Allah talked to Moses?
),both have the same answer type (Location).
How-ever, the Rule-based classifier cannot determine thecorrect answer type of the second question sincethe question word (Where) is omitted.
Our SVMclassifier, on the other hand, learns that a moun-tain name is of type location, therefore it correctlyclassifies the two questions.593.3 Information Retrieval (IR)The preprocessed question is now fed to the In-formation Retrieval module that retrieves the mostsemantically related verses from the Quran andits interpretation books (Tafseer).
Our approachis based on the explicit semantic analysis ap-proach (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) thataugments keyword-based text representation withconcept-based features, automatically extractedfrom massive human knowledge repositories suchas Wikipedia.
However, instead of using Wikipediaas ontology, we build our Quranic ontology of con-cepts which classifies the Quran verses accordingto their topics.
Details of building our Quranicontology are shown in Section 4.
We use machine-learning techniques to build a Semantic Interpreteras in (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) that mapsfragments of natural language text into a weightedvector of Quranic concepts.
Each leaf concept inthe ontology has a list of verses, which are relatedto this concept.
For each leaf concept Ci, a docu-ment Diis constructed, where Diis a documentof verses and their Tafseer that belong to Ci.
Thenpreprocessing on Diis applied and finally an in-dex on Diis created using Lucene Indexer1.
EachQuranic concept will be represented by a vector ofterms that occur in the corresponding document.Entries of this vector are assigned weights usingthe TFIDF scheme.
These weights quantify thestrength of association between terms and concepts.To speed semantic interpretation, we build an in-verted index which maps each term into a list ofconcepts in which it appears.
Using the SemanticInterpreter in a way similar to that in (Gabrilovichand Markovitch, 2007), a weighted vector of con-cepts is generated for each verse in the Quran andstored in our database.
This is done in the offlinephase.
Similarly, the vector of the input query iscalculated in the online phase.
To select the top-scoring verses that are semantically related to theuser question we compute the cosine similarity be-tween the concept vector of the input query and theconcept vector of each verse in the Quran.3.4 Answer ExtractionAfter the relevant verses are retrieved, these verses,their Tafseer and the expected answer type are fedinto the Answer Extraction stage to extract the finalanswer to the input question.
We define the answeras the phrase which contains the expected answer1http://lucene.apache.org/type (a named entity or a description of a namedentity).
The Answer extraction stage consists ofthe following steps: First, the named entities in theinput question are identified.
Then, several featuresare extracted which are used to rank each candidateanswer.3.4.1 Arabic Named Entity RecognitionNamed Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask ofinformation extraction, where each proper name inthe input passage - such as persons, locations andnumbers - is assigned a named entity tag.
We buildthe training data as shown in Section 4, then use itto feed LingPipe tool2which constructs the NERmodel.
The NER model is then used in the onlinephase to tag the input text.3.4.2 Feature ExtractionOnce we have the preprocessed question Q taggedwith named entities, we divide the relevant versesand their Tafseer into passages such that each pas-sage is a candidate answer.
For each candidateanswer A, we get the probability of correctnessC given the question Q and the candidate answerA.
Then, the few candidate answers that have thehighest probability of correctness are returned.
Aset of features are used to calculate the probabilityof correctness as mentioned by (Wang, 2006), suchas:(a) Maximum number of matched words betweenthe input question and the candidate answer.
(b) The type of the question?s expected answerif it matches with the extracted named entityin the answer passage in case of factoid ques-tions.
(c) Is-A relationship in case of definitional ques-tions, in the form: ?NE?
is a ?description?.
(d) The maximum count of named entity typesthat occurred in the question occurring in thecandidate answer.
(e) The minimum distance between matchedterms in the passage.4 DatasetsIn this section, we describe the datasets that weused in different modules of the system.2http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/60Quranic Ontology and Tafseer Books:We integrated the Quranic Corpus Ontology(Atwell et al., 2011) and the Qurany Ontology(Abbas, 2009), to form the Quranic conceptualontology that we use in our system.
The QuranicCorpus Ontology uses knowledge representationto define the key concepts in the Quran, and showsthe relationships between these concepts usingpredicate logic.
The Qurany Ontology is a treeof concepts that includes all the abstract conceptscovered in the Quran.
It is imported from ?MushafAl Tajweed?
list of topics.
This integration wasdifficult since we had to resolve the overlappingbetween the two ontologies.
There were also somemistakes in the Qurany Concept Tree.
So, we hadto manually revise the 1200 concepts and theirverses.The Holy Quran consists of 6236 verses.
In ourQuranic ontology, each verse must be classifiedto one or more concepts depending on thesemantics of this verse.
After adding QuranicCorpus ontology, there were 621 verses withoutconcepts, so we added them under their mostsuitable concepts to complete the ontology using asimilarity measure module.
This module measuresthe similarity between classified and unclassifiedverses to determine the concepts of unclassifiedverses.
Now, our final ontology contains 1217 leafconcepts and all verses of the Quran.
Under eachconcept in our ontology, we save the related verseswith their Tafseer, that is used to build the invertedindex.
We use two Tafseer books: (Ibn-Kathir,1370) and (Al-Jaza?iri, 1986), which are two of themost traditional books used by Islamic scholars.
Itis possible to add other books to enrich our corpusdata.
We also use the Tafseer books to extract thecandidate answer passages.NER Data:To train our NER module, we need a new annotatedcorpus specialized for the Quran.
Fortunately,Quranic Arabic corpus provides NE annotationsfor the Quran.
This corpus is a hierarchical concepttree that has about 14 main classes.
We mappedthese classes to 5 categories and also manuallyadded a new class for Numbers.
We used a bookcalled ?Numbers and Ratios in Quran?
(Ali, 2008)to tag the numbers in the Quran.
Table 1 shows thefinal classes and their members.
(a) CoNLL 2002(b) Al-BayanFigure 2: Format of the NER training file.
Eachnamed entity is tagged with its beginning or contin-uing token picked out with tags B-class and I-classrespectively.
If the word is not named entity it istagged with 0.Our training data was annotated to have thesame format of CoNLL 2002 corpora3as shown inFigure 2.Question Classification Data:We built a new taxonomy for Question Classifica-tion based on the NE categories discussed above.We also had to construct the training and test datasuitable for this taxonomy.
Our data consists of230 classified questions collected randomly fromforums or some common Quranic questions, di-vided into 180 questions used for training and 50questions used for testing.
The questions are classi-fied according to their answer types into: (Creation,Entity, Physical, Location, Number, Description),where the first 5 classes are the named entitiesdetected by the NER module, and the last classdiscriminates the definitional questions.
The dis-tribution of the questions among these classes isshown in Table 25 EvaluationWe evaluated the different modules of our systemas well as the overall system accuracy.5.1 NER ModuleWe evaluated this module using LingPipe evalua-tor.
The training data is divided into 3 folds andthe overall Precision, Recall and F-measure arecalculated.
Results are shown in Figure 3.3http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2002/ner/61Al-Bayan NERclassesMembersCreation Human - Angels - jinn.

We used180 questions for training.
The overall accuracyof the classifier using 3-folds cross-validation is77.2%.
The precision, recall and F-measure of the 6classes is shown in Figure 4.
We also evaluated theclassifier using an independent set of 50 questions.The accuracy of the classifier on this set is 86%.5.3 Overall System EvaluationEvaluating our overall system is not an easy task,since we do not have a gold-standard for the Quranquestions to compare with our results.
Humanshave the ability to judge the semantic relatednessof texts.
Human judgments can be considered agold standard against which computer algorithmsare evaluated.
Therefore, we asked some experts inQuran to judge our system accuracy.
The systemwas evaluated by 5 Quran experts, using 59 ques-tions.
The output of our system for each questionwas the top-3 answers and the top-5 related verses.Each expert marked each verse or answer as rightor wrong.Figure 5 shows some examples of the evaluationquestions with the answers retrieved by Al-Bayansystem.
For the first question (Who is the Queenof Sheba?
), although the answer (Bilkis) is notexplicitly mentioned in the Quran, the system wasable to extract the correct answer from the Tafseerof the related verses.
For the second question (Howmany months is the period of waiting of widows?
),the system elegantly extracts the complete answerwhich includes different conditions of the pregnantand non-pregnant widows.
The third and fourthquestions are examples of definitional questions.We used the TopN accuracy (Manning et al.,2008) to evaluate the overall system.
TopN accu-racy of correct answers is calculated as the numberof questions in which at least one of the top Nanswer candidates is correct, divided by the totalnumber of questions.
We also calculate the preci-62IRModuleTop-1 0.692Top-5 0.847Precision 0.57(a)OverallSystemTop-1 0.650Top-3 0.854Precision 0.73(b)Table 3: Experts Evaluation Resultssion when the system outputs 5 related verses and3 answer passages.
Table 3a shows the results ofthe verses retrieved from the IR module and Ta-ble 3b shows the results of the overall system.
Wenotice that the Top-3 results of the overall systemis better than Top-1 results, that is why we returnTop-3 answers to the user to increase the probabil-ity of correct answers.
We also noticed that theresults of the overall system is better than infor-mation retrieval results, which shows that answerextraction module improves the accuracy of theoverall system.6 Conclusion and Future WorkIn this paper, we proposed a novel Question An-swering system for the Quran, that takes an Arabicquestion as an input and retrieves semantically rele-vant verses as candidate passages.
Then an answerextraction module extracts the answer from the re-trieved verses accompanied by their Tafseer.
Wealso proposed a new taxonomy for Quranic NamedEntities and constructed an Arabic Question Clas-sifier based on state-of-the-art techniques.
Our ini-tial results evaluated by Quranic experts show thefeasibility of constructing an accurate QA systemspecialized for the Quran.In the future, we plan to explore more complexquestions such as: list-type questions.
In order toimprove the accuracy of the system, we plan to useactive learning techniques which are appropriatewhen the gold-standard is scarce or expensive toobtain.
Thus, Quran experts can give their feedbackabout the answers and the system would learn fromthis feedback and improve its results.
Finally, weplan to make the proposed system publicly avail-able to the research community.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Dr. Noorhan Hassan Abbasand Prof. Dr. Eric Atwell from University of Leedsfor providing us with the Qurany Ontology files.ReferencesAbdul-Baquee M. Sharaf and Eric Atwell.
