are analyzed, with the conclusion, that the description ofa natural language should have ~ a creative and a trans-ductive part.
As a system meeting the principal known conditions,a sequence of pushdown store transducers, interpreted as a stra-t~f~cational language descrlption~is proposed.Sgall 2I.I In the works of N. ~homsky, P.M.Postal, J.J.Katz andothers there are formulated three zeneral aims of generativegrammar:a) the grammar generatesf all and only the grammatical senten-ces of the doscribed languase, in the senBe of a mathem,~ticalenumeration of the set of grammatical sentences;b) the grammar automatically ascribes to each generated sentencea structural d~scription, not contradictory to the intuitiveevidence of native speakers~ if the same sentence is generatedby the grammar in ~ different ways, ~ different structuraldescriptions a~e ascribed to it~c) the grammar is a description of the mechanism the user of thelanguage has internalized and uses in the process of langua-ge co~2.unication (as a speaker, hearer etc.
).There are, of course, other aims or conditions laid upongenerative grammars, e.g.
those concerning degrees of grmmmati ~calness of sentences.
But our main point here concerns the threeconditions cited; we assume that these a~e actually three diffe-rent conditions, in particular that ~ and ~ are not identlca~being implied by ~, so that a grammar can exist, which satisfiesthe conditions A and ~, but not ~.I~2 If we examine the new version of transformationaldescript-i~n~from that point of view, we see that there aredifficulties concerning the ccndition ~.
Of course, we are nowapplying the conditions not only to the grammar, but to thewhole description, including its semantic component.
~e are notcertain, however, that the mutual relations of the thyee componentsof this description have been characterized quite correctly.
Thereis one creative component, (A), whose output is interpreted bySgall 5both (B), i.e.
semantics, and (C); but then - in my opinion - (A)ig the basis (including lexical rules), and the transformationaland phonological parts 0elong to (C).
Whether this is the case ornot, the formulation of the new shape of the transformationaldescription is a further and important step in overcoming the one-sidedness of descriptivism.
An adequate basis for fulfilling theconditions g and ~ may be considered to have been reached in ~hisway.But our question remains: can this system really be consideredto describe the mechanism used in speech communication?J.J.Katz writes (/5/, p.4; similarly in /6/): "The wholeprocess may be pictured as follows: the speaker, for reasons thatare biographically relevant but linguistically not, chooses amessage he wants to convey to the hearer .
.
.
.
This message istranslated into syntactic form by the selection of a syntacticstructure whose semantic interpretation is this message~' Of course,the question, why a particular message has been chosen, is not alinguistic one.
But if the mechanism used by the speaker to trans-late the message into syntactic form were to be described as adevice for translating, not just for selection, this other des-cription would be preferable, as to that point.1.3 The generative description is neutral to the speaker andto the hearer, i.e.
to the production and understandlng of senten-ces.
But in a sense the generation is nearer to the production,just as the recognition procedure is nearer to the understandingof sentences.
That is, the sentence appears as an output string inthe generative description and in the process of production, whereasin the recognition routine and in the process of understanding itappears as an input string.N.C~omsky introduced the distinction of the competence and theperformance of language users;~ the methodological importance ofSgall 4this distinction is undeniable.
But it is not evident whetherthe generative grammar is the same as the description of thecompetence of both speaker and hearer; it is not clear whethera recognition grammar belongs to the realm of performance (CfoHays /4Tp.8/) , or to the realm of competence, also (cf~ catego-rical and other grammars, formulated as recognition grammars,e.g.
/I/, but not intended as models of the hearer's activity).One sees, of course, that the actual programs for random genera-tion of sentences /17,9/ are not models of the speaker's activity,either.
But that is not due, perhaps, to their being related togenerative grammars.So our questions are: Has a description of the user'scoz~petence to be neutral with regard to the speaker and thehea~er?
(Or, better: Are all the differences between the speaker'sand the he~rer's activity due only to their performance, are thereno differences which should be respected in a description of theircompetence, of the mechanism they have internalized?)
And, further:If the generative description is neutral in this respect, is therecognition description also neutral?
- ~f we assume that the setof grammatical ~entences is a recursive one, then why should weprefer ~eneration as the form af the description of lanA~age, andnot recognition?2.1.
The mechanism internalized by the user of a languageenables him (I) to choose a message as such, (II) to formulatethis message, i.e.
to translate it from its "semantic" form toone of the corresponding phonetic forms, (IIl) to "interpret" ,or understand a sentence, i.e.
to translate it f~om its phoneticform to an~ of the corresponding "semantic" forms, (IV) to choosethe most appropriate form, while translating in either direction.The parts (I) and (IV) cannot be fully described by linguisticSgall 5means alone.
As to parts (II) and (III), we see that they areessentially translating procedures.
They may include some blockingor checking sub parts, but we should try to describe at least theirmain parts as tr~msducers or in some similar way (or, alternatively,to show that this is impossible).The vast and heterogeneous field presystematically called4semantics should be analyzed from such a point of view; there areelements in it which belong to the "transductive" part of themechanism and are purely linguistic;~ the relations between levelsor strata of the l~n~uage system can be described as "semantic"relations (relations of"representation", with the so-called"assymetrical2 dualism", i.e.
generally manyvj- toz  many relations/~,I~.
On the other hand, there are othe~ quite distinct, "semantic"problems, concerning the manner of choice of a message itself, and\of these only some are intrinsically linguistic (e.g.
questionsconcerning anal~contradiction).2.2 Even if the mechanism briefly outlined above could beintegrally described, it ~ould be a description of the competence,not of the perfd~mance of a user of language.
It would not describe,particularly, the relations connected with restrictions of memoryand other faculties of individual speakers, nor v~rious possibleshort-cuts used during the process of speech.
It would hardly bepossible to de~cyibe, by linguistic means, the conditions underbywhich a construction is being built upVthe speaker during the actof speech, and the conditions under which it is delivered as a wholeby the memory~ only extreme eases, where there is only the latter~possibility, are distinguished explicitly by the grammar; the formerconstructions are, e.g.
"analytical" forms of newly coined oraccepted words formed "by analogy"; at the other extreme are idioms,"irregular" forms and other "exceptions", which have to be listedSgall 6by the grammar.
In most cases, there are both possibilities, andit is not one of the purposes of linguistics to say whether (or,under what conditions) the spe~ker chooses the first or the second.We can say, then, that the distinction between competence andperformance is independent from that between speaker and hea~er.If the description contains some part(s) used only by the speaker,and others used only by the hearer, it does not follow that it isno longer a description only of their competence.2.3.
If I understand correctly the words of J.J.Katz, citedin 1.2, then he defines the message as a unit of the semantic level(the message is a semantic interpretation of a sentoid).
Enumerationof all possible messages (of a language) is a necessary part (orprerequisite, perhaps) of a description of a language, and it is,ofcourse, preferable that the mechanism of this enumeration shouldascribe structural descriptions to the generated messages (seein 1.1).
But it is not elear whether the transformational descrip-tion really can serve as such an enumeration.
If so (e.g.
if thesemantic component does not, as a filter, block an infinite numberof sentoids), then it would be possible to reverse the semanticcomponent in some way (to discover its inverse machine), and usethis inverted procedure as the description of the mechanism thespeaker uses while translating the message to its syntactic form.If there is no such possibility, then the semantic component in itspresent form is not satisfactory, either.On th~ other hand, it is not necessary, in a linguistic descrip-tion, to ~enerate the set of messages by a system which could serveas a model of the mechanism internalized by the users of a language(1.1.~).
Bearing in m~nd, that the description of the complicatedrelations between the semantic and phonetic levels, and not theselection of the message, belongs to the classical aims of linguis-tics, we can model not the .
:~echanism used by the speaker and theSgall 7 ?hearer, but %~used by the translator, who has to discover the~K"meaning(s) pertaining to a certain phonetic string and vice versa,Ibut not to choose the meaning itself.
(But cf.3.3.
)~ Of course,we have to distinguish here between cases where translationproceeds only as an operation on texts, without using other thanlinguistics knowledge and knowledge obtained from the translatedtext itself, and cases, where the translator has to obtain fromexternal sources information not contained in the text butD ~ 1 " " ~'~ ~e ~eq, ired by the grammar of the output lan~uag (in cases as "kingJohn's son" tran~l~ted to German "ein Sohn des K6nigs J."
or"der Sohn. "
of./13/) We are concerned here only with transla- " ?
3 ?tion in the narrow sense;, the mechanism descrioed does not enablethe translator to select one of the possibilities in the caseswhere such external information is necessary.3.1?
Viewed?
in this way, the generative system should have~,htwQ parts: a purely generative one, serving to enumerate possiblemessages, or meanings of messages, and another "transductive" part,describing the tr~nslation of messages from one level to another.The message can be composed, of course, of many sentences, but,as is usual today, we take no account of the difference andspeak of sentences onl~ in the Sequel.This sjstem should not be more elaborate than necessary, butthere are some known conditions it has to fulfil.
As to weak gene-rative power , it has to generate not only the sets of strings gene-2ated by a context-free phrase structure grammar, but also at leastset of all strings of the form xa_~x, where ~ is a symbol o~he theoutput vocabulary and ~ is any string of such symbols not containing~; cf., in a somewhat different formulation, /12/.
As to stronggenerative power, the system has to ascribe not only taxonomicalstructural descriptions, i.e.
there must be a possibility of having' Sga l l  8structural descriptions not just for sentences, but for several le-vels of sentence structure, such as the deep structure and thesurface structure.3.2.
One possible system meeting these conditions is asequence of pushdown store transducers /11;3/, interpreted as astratificational description /8;14/.
Its first, generative and recur-sire part would be a context-free phrase structure grammar or a sys-T~r~ ~\]r tem .... ~.ly equivalent to it, enumerating the "sentence meanings "~in such a way that the output string itself serves as the descrip-tion of the sentence structure at this level.
This string ist~mslated then by an other pushdown store transducer 6r o ther~a~transducers)to the level of "surface stA'ucture" (a l&nearizedtreeversion Of the dependency m x ~  of the sentence), and furt-her to the morphological level.
For a ~ o f  such a system, see/15; 16/.We can formulate the first part of this system so as to gene-rate all strings of the form xa_._xx" and only them (where ~" is thereflection of ~), and the second part can consist of the followingrules (symbolized here as done by Evey, with some simplification;denotes any symbol of the input alphabet other than ~ ):input p inn.
- -@ inn.
pstate stateb 1 1a 1 2b 2 Z b3 stop!outputb8bSgall 9The output of this translator would be x ax, whenever xa__.xx warits input string.
So the first condition of 3.1. is fulfilled.
Itshould be noted that we are not u~3ing the word "translate" in thetechnical sense used by R.J.Evey; the input language of our trans-lator contains the set of the strings xax" as its proper sub~.~et.There is still a possibility that, at least for some languages, adescription would be adequate where the input language of eachtranslator is the same as the output language of its predecessorin the sequence of machines.
Th@ weak generative power of such asystem would then equal that of a context-free phrase structurel~mguage (cf./13/, theorem 2:6.6).As to the socond condition, concerning stror~ generative power,our system, as a stratificational one, shares the main property oftransformational description and cannot be held to be taxonomic.There ~re three levels or strata (not to speak of phonology amdphonetics; but the question of the nmmber of strata is an empiricalone and it is possible that typologically different languages donot coincide in this respect; we are working v~ith inflectedlanguages, such as Czech or ~ussian): the tectogrammatical or"semantic" level (Lo) , the phenogrammatical level (surface structure,L1) , and the morpholo ical level (L2).
The sequence of representationsof a sentence on each of these levels, s member of L~ L IXL  2~ulfilling the condition that each of its elements is derivableby the transducer system (from its predecessor in the sequence, ifShore is any), is a structural description of that sentence.
Acomplete derivational history is not needed here, because the symbolsuseful for the structural description appear in the terminal stringsof the transducers, so that these strings (or some of them, as asequence of two transducers is generally needed to translate thesentence f~m one level to a~other)themselves serve as theSga l l  I0representations of sentences at the corresponding level.So, not a unique description of the ss~actic structure isascribed to a sentence (with no homonymy) but, rather, two dis-tinct descriptions (elements of L 0 and L1, respectively), whosemutual relation can be compared with that of Chomsky's deep struc-ture and surface structure.
In cases such as questions, grammati-cally conditioned change of word order apparently disturbing theconstituent structure of the ~entence, nominalizations etc., therules of our system are to a great extent parallel to those of thetr~nsformational description.
But cases such as the passive orlexical synonyL~ and honlonymy are handled in our system in such a%way that the representation of the sentence at the tecto~rammaticallevel is unique for the synonymous expressions (and distinct, ofcourse, for the homonymous ones).The third level of our system, the morphological, includescategories of "rectlon" and concord, not included in the "syntac-tic" levels.3.3.
The recursive component of our system, w~th the initialsymbol ~ and the gradual derivation of the terminal string firstby rules of expansion and then by rules of selection, does not_ _ ~, stated in 2.3 , it is not necessa- Wulfil condition c o,?
1.I.
But,  ?ry that a linguistic description should contain a description of themecl~nism used by the speaker in that part of his activity.
Rossiblythis gap can be filled in the future by reformulation of the gene--ration routine.There are other difficulties in this component, concerning thecondition ~.
The main point here is the formulation of contextrestrictions relevant to the selection of terminal symbols; wethink that it is possible to define various partitions on thevocabulary of this component, so that we can work with rule schemataSgall 11not only as with a conventional simplification of notatien~ butalso as with an intrinsic part of the system;~ the weak equivalencewith a context-free phrase structure grammar should not be lost bythis.Another remark concerns the confronYation of the tectogra-mmatical levels of two language% necessarily made by a translator.An ideal case of translation would be the full coizcidence of boththese levels.
Generallyj the translator, if he is to translatecorreG~ly, is supposed to use (as a part of the mechanism interna-lized) some routine converting strings of the tecto&Tammaticallevel of the input language to those of the output language.
Thispart of the mechanism is not as yet described by our system, as weconsider one language only, i.e.
a translator translating fromhis mother tongue to the some l~nguage.
But elaboration of thispart of the system is needed, and is directly relevant to MachineTranslation as well as to general linguistic theory.3.4.
The transducers have to fulfil certain special conditions,so that the existence not only of an inverse machine ~bir each ofthem but also of a recognition routine for the whole system isensured as well.
These conditions, which we shall not present herein full, are parallel to the absence of deletion rules in a phrasestructure grammar under similar circumstances.
We can say, infor-mally, that no symbol re~d in the input is deleted by the rulesof a transducer, except in cases where that symbol can be determineduniquely by the resulting output.
Free deletions are confined totransduction from the morphonological to the phonological level,or from the phonological to the phonetic level.
At those stages,the existence of a recognition routine is given by the fact thatthe corresponding transducers are finite state#.The system can serve then, in its transductive part, as aSgall 12description of a part of the translator's competence, as well asa basis for translation al~orithmus.
As to the actual performance,as well as the actual algorithms, here various digressions fromthe process defined by the transducer system can be found, as wellas restrictions due to the finite memory etc.
A hearer performing(mostly in an unconscious way, probably) the process of understan-ding a sentence, does not have to follow the rules of the abpvementioned inverse machines punctually.
He can use various short-cuts or trial-and-error methods, checking the results (cf.Matthews,/I0/).
But t~at may also be true for the speaker, as far as we know.3.5.
With regard to terminology, it is possible to distinguishseveral pairs of notions concerning routines of both kinds:the sentence (its phoneticrepresentation) isin the outputenumeration~enerationin the inputdecisionrecognitionsynthesis analy sisproduction understandingnotedefinition of a set...combined with automatica~3cribing of structuraldescription...interpretable as thedescription of the mecha-nism used by the translator...process of performance4.
So we arrive at the conclusion that the connection bwtweenthe theory of grammar and the purposes of Machine Translation is anintrinsic one.
It is of importance to practical research (whereresearch on MT, using the findings of the theory of grammar andalgebraic linguistics, makes possible through study of its empiricalSgall ISquestions and testing of its working hypotheses).
Moreover, therelation~ship between the theory and the purposes of tr~Lnslationhas a bearing on the understanding of the theoretical co~epts them-selves.
And the importance of this a~pect Will increase, probably,as theory proceeds from the study of individual l~nguages to the~escription of language universals and other relations betweennatural lsngu~%es, and to the description of language in generaloSgall 14r%A~ L ITE  ATURA./I/ Y.Bar-Hillel, Language and Information, Je~"usalem- Re~ding-London, 1964/2/  N.Chomsky, Catego~'ies and Y<elations in Syntactic Theory (mimeo~jr.for the Conference on Structural Linguistics, ~lagdeburg,1964)/3/ R.J.Evey, The Theory and Applications of Pushdown Store ~%achi-nes, Mathematical Linguistics and Automatic Translation~Report No.
