Roles, Co-Descriptors, and theFormal Representation of Quantified English ExpressionsWil l iam A. Mar t in  1Laboratory for Computer ScienceMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyCambridge, Massachusetts 02139A scheme is proposed for representing the logical form of English sentences, whereinthe meaning of a network node depends on how it is related through "role-in" links tonodes representing more aggregate entities.
It is argued that roles are a natural device forcapturing many linguistic and philosophic distinctions, and that they are convenient forcomputational processing.
In particular, it is shown how role-in links may be advantageous-ly used in lieu of quantifier scope to represent quantificational dependencies.1.
IntroductionIn representing the semantics of English sentences,it is traditional to distinguish "logical form" from se-mantic content.
Chomsky \[2\], for instance, introducesLF (his version of logical form) as a linguistic level ofrepresentation between syntax (phrase structure) andsemantics.Representations of logical form, which are typicallybased on predicate calculus or lambda calculus, mustbe carefully chosen for empirical adequacy as well ascomputational convenience.
There are at least threegeneral ways in which predicate or lambda calculusmight be carried over into representations of logicalform:( la)  directly (as by a theorem prover);( lb)  by replacing quantification with dynami-cally scoped iteration procedures (as inWoods \[30\]); or1 This paper was substantially revised after Professor Martin'sdeath by a group of his colleagues to satisfy length constraints andto take advantage of the reviewers' extensive and thoughtful com-ments.
We wish to thank the editor and reviewers for their cooper-ation under these unfortunate circumstances.

( lc)  by translating into a semantic networkformalism (as in Hendrix \[10\]).The second and third are more process-oriented; thatis, they more closely relate elements of the representa-tion and states in the interpretation process.
In myview, a process orientation is needed if issues of effi-ciency are to be discussed at all.
2 One key to efficien-cy is the delaying of decisions as long as possible.This is easier to achieve when differences betweenalternative interpretations are minimized.The two process-oriented approaches noted abovediffer in their treatment of scope dependencies.
Forexample, we can model "each bottle" in(2) Each cork is fastened to each bottle by asmall wire basket.with a quantifier like (?x: bottle), and then translatethat into an explicit FOR loop clause.
Alternatively,we can employ Skolem functions, with "wire" and"basket" modeled as functions of a variable rangingover "bottle".
These functions and variables can thenbe represented in a semantic network, along the linesdiscussed in "What's in a Link?"
\[29\].I choose to adopt a particular semantic networkapproach wherein it is more appropriate to view mean-ings of nodes decompositionally (i.e., as dependentupon what they are constituents of) rather than com-positionally (i.e., as fully determined by the meanings2 It is unclear how to pose efficiency questions in a non-process-oriented framework, where even effectiveness may berejected as a desideratum.Copyright 1981 by the Association for Computational Linguistics.

More specifically, the meaningof a network node depends (decompositionally) onhow it is related though "role-in links ''3 to nodes rep-resenting more aggregate ntities.
The decomposition-al view is preferable for explaining a number of lin-guistic phenomena.
I will show, in this paper, thatmany important linguistic and philosophical distinc-tions can be analyzed as differences in role-in linkag-es.
Among these are the intensional/extensional ,referential/attr ibutive, and distributive/collective dis-tinctions.My approach turns out to be more complex thansome, but I will argue that it captures ubtle cases in amore natural way and that it is superior for computa-tional purposes.
Indeed it has been my experience (asin the development of MACSYMA \[13\]) that a repre-sentational formalism with more constructs often per-mits more efficient processing than a formalism basedon a smaller set of more primitive operators.
I suspectthat this experience will strike home with many read-ers familiar with the difficulties encountered bypredicate-calculus-based theorem provers.t~1 generic node?

RolesFigures la - l c  illustrate the sort of semantic net-work I use.
(In these and subsequent figures, onlythose nodes and links are shown that are relevant tothe issues under discussion.
By convention, l inks with-out arrowheads are to be taken as directed upwards.
)The networks shown in this figure have two kindsof nodes, generic and individual, and three kinds oflinks, inherits-from, may-be-described-as, nd role-in.Generic nodes (e.g.
ARCH)  represent generic objects;individual nodes (e.g.
ARCH-1 and ARCH-2)  repre-sent instances of generic objects.
Inherits-from linksare used to say that the individuals ARCH-1  andARCH-2  inherit properties from the generic ARCH.May-be-described-as links are used to indicate that anARCH is a STRUCTURE.
4 Finally, role-in links areused to indicate that R1 and R2 are parts of the gen-eric ARCH.
The "meaning" of a node depends prima-rily upon role-in links that connect it to nodes repre-senting more aggregate ntities.My representation is similar to several in the litera-ture.
Generic nodes correspond to Minsky frames \[16\]and roles (parts of generic objects) correspond to slots(parts of frames).
One can also draw analogies withset theory.
May-be-descr ibed-as links and inherits-from are similar to set inclusion and set membership.3 Role-in links could be viewed logically as Skolem dependen-cies.4 May-be-descr ibed-as nd inherits-from are similar to "is-a"links.Figure lb.

I consider the intension/extension distinc-tion extremely important, because intensional repre-sentations appear to be more natural for certain sen-tenees.
5My representation does not deal with contextualproblems by assuming a set of objects called contexts(or partitions) and then somehow stipulating a contextlink for each node.
Instead, I argue that roles allow amore natural modeling of the context phenomena.
Forexample, Figure 2 shows how Hendrix \[10\] representsthe fact that legal persons can own physical objects.Rectangles (and squares) represent partitions(contexts).
An individual or set is in a partition if itsrepresenting circle is in the rectangle representing thatpartition.
In this figure, the individual I is an implica-tion that any individual owning X has an individualagent Y, which is a legal person; an individual objectZ, which is a physical object; an individual start-timet 1, which is a time; and an individual end-t ime t 2,which is also a time.This same information is shown in Figure 3, usingthe notation presented here.
Figure 3 eliminates theindividuals I and X, the implication node, the contextsurrounding I, and the context surrounding Y, Z, t 1,and t 2.
Some of these are replaced in Figure 3 with aricher variety of node types; I believe these types havebetter linguistic and philosophical motivations thanHendrix's abstract individuals, contexts, and implica-tions.3.
Reference and Definite DescriptionsRussell's \[22\] analysis of a singular definite descrip-tion required the existence of a unique object satisfy-ing the description in order for the expression to de-note anything, and hence it fails to account for thesuccessful reference of a noun phrase like "the clock"in(5) Did you wind the clock?Strawson \[25\] views these definite descriptions inrelativistic terms: even when the referent cannot bedetermined in an absolute sense, as a particular clockfor example, the description still has some meaningrelative to whatever the context turns out to be.
(6) When shall we say that a hearer knows whatparticular is being referred to by a speaker?Consider first the following case.
A speakertells a story which he claims to be factual.
Itbegins, "A man and a boy were standing bya fountain," and it continues: "The man hada drink".
Shall we say that the hearer knows5 1 choose to avoid the question of formal adequacy becausealmost all systems, intensional as well as extensional, are formallyadequate in the sense that they are capable of representing all(effective) functions.
A much more interesting question is whetherthey are capable of representing all functions in a natural way.which or what particular is being referred toby the subject expression in the second sen-tence?
We might say so.
For, of a certain_ range of two particulars the words "the man"serve to distinguish the one being referred to,by means of a description which applies onlyto him.
But though this is, in a weak sense,a case of identification, I shall call it only astory-relative or, for short, a relative identifi-cation.
For it is identification only relativeto a range of particulars (a range of twomembers)  which is itself identified only asthe range of particulars being talked aboutby the speaker.
That is to say, the hearer,hearing the second sentence, knows whichparticular creature is being referred to of thetwo particular creatures being talked about bythe speaker; but he does not, without thisqualification, know what particular creatureis being referred to.
The identif ication iswithin a certain story told by a certainspeaker.
It is identification within his storybut not identification within history.Following this line of thought, sentence (5) mightbe represented as follows, where clock-1 describes aparticular clock and the-clock-1 describes the clockrelative to the discourse.

1 real-worlddid-you-win6\[the-clock-1 I the-clock-1e.3.1 Referential and Attributive Use ofDefinite DescriptionsDonnellan \[3\] has suggested that definite descrip-tions like "the clock" have two uses: referential andattributive.
Attributive use asserts something about"whoever or whatever is the so-and-so";  referentialuse is intended to allow the hearer to identify at once,in his own terms, who or what is being talked about.
(10) I will call the two uses of definite descrip-tions I have in mind the attributive use andthe referential use.
A speaker who uses adefinite description attributively in an asser-tion states something about whoever orwhatever is the so-and-so.
A speaker whouses a definite description referentially in anassertion, on the other hand, uses the de-scription to enable his audience to pick outwhom or what he is talking about and statessomething about that person or thing.
In thefirst case the definite description might besaid to occur essentially, for the speakerwishes to assert something about whatever orwhoever fits that description; but in the ref-erential use the definite description is merelyone tool for doing a certain job - -  calling at-tention to a person or th ing- -  and in generalany other device for doing the same job, an-other description or a name, would do aswell.
In the attributive use, the attribute ofbeing the so-and-so is all important, while itis not in the referential use.To illustrate this distinction, in the case ofa single sentence, consider the sentence,"Smith's murderer is insane".
Suppose firstthat we come upon poor Smith foully mur-dered.
From the brutal manner of the killingand the fact that Smith was the most lovableperson in the world, we might exclaim,"Smith's murderer is insane".
I will assume,to make it a simpler case, that in a quite or-dinary sense we do not know who murderedSmith (though this is not in the end essentialto the case).
This I shall say, is an attrib-utive use of the definite description.The contrast with such a use of the sen-tence is one of those situations in which weexpect and intend our audience to realizewhom we have in mind when we speak ofSmith's murderer and, most importantly, toknow that it is this person about whom weare going to say something.For example, suppose that Jones has beencharged with Smith's murder and has beenplaced on trial.
Imagine that there is a dis-cussion of Jones's odd behavior at his trial.We might sum up our impression of his be-havior by saying, "Smith's murderer is in-sane".
If someone asks to whom we are ref-erring, by using this description, the answerhere is " Jones".
This, I shall say, is a refer-ential use of the definite description.The distinction is brought out nicely by the follow-ing pair of sentences from Moore \[17\] and their corre-sponding semantic net representations (Figures 4 and5).
(1 la) The President has been marriedsince 1945. referential( l lb )  The President has lived in theWhite House since 1800. attributiveSentence ( l l a )  refers to the person who is currentlyPresident, while sentence (1 lb)  refers to whoever waspresident at each point in time since 1800.
The truthof ( l lb )  is not dependent on who is filling the role ofPresident.
In fact, we can go even farther.
In thepast the President has been killed and it has taken awhile to swear in the new President.
During this timethere is no President, yet ( l lb )  is still true.
In ( l l a ) ,by contrast, the referent of "the President", president-1, is not a role in "the President is married", as shownin Figure 4.
Therefore, we are not at liberty to havethe referent change with time.6The referent ia l /attr ibut ive distinction might havebeen ascribed to differences of scope in quantif iedexpressions.
(12a) (the p : president) (?
t since 1945) p hasbeen married at time t. referential(12b) (V t after 1800) (the p : president) p haslived in the white house at time t. attributive(13a) ((~ (p) (true-at-t ime (married p)(every (t) (after t 1945))))(the (y) (pres y))) referential(13b) (true-at-t ime (live-in (the (y)(pres y)) white-house)(every (t) (after t 1800))) attributive6 A method for the sequential binding of quantified variablesin determining the truth of an expression was introduced by Hintik-ka \[11\].
Although he was working with predicate calculus, heobviously had in mind the same general strategy proposed here.American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981 141Wi l l iam A.

Attributive use of the president.My representation, in contrast, makes it easy for theinterpreter to delay the decision because it minimizesthe difference between the two cases.
It is also possi-ble for the interpreter never to decide which reading isintended.
For example, in a sentence such as, "Thepresident has owned a terrier since February,"  thelistener will not be able to distinguish between the tworeadings.
If a later sentence requires the listener tomake a distinction, only a minimal alteration to therepresentation is required.
Partee \[19\] makes an argu-ment that further supports this approach.
(14) ... having a particular individual in mind(the "referential" case) and knowing nothingabout an individual other than some descrip-tive phrase (the "attr ibutive" case) may bejust two extremes on a continuum of"vividness".
One may consider, for instance,the case of a detective tracking down a crim-inal and obtaining more and more clues, in-cluding fingerprints, voice recordings, photo-graphs of varying clarity, etc.
It is not at allclear at what point the detective, who maybe described as "looking for the man whodid so-and-so" stops looking for "whoever itis that did so-and-so" and starts looking fora particular individual.3.2 Subject Co-Descriptors (Verb Phrase Deletion)Both Figures 4 and 5 employ co-description be-tween the-President and subject-of-x, where x is thesentential predicate.
Sentences (15a) and (15b) fromSag \[23\] offer further support for this convention.
(15a) The chickens are ready to eat, and thechildren are too.
(15b) John likes flying planes, and Bill does too.In these examples, the subject plays the same role inboth conjuncts.
That is, if the chickens are ready tobe eaten, then the children are also ready to be eaten,and if the chickens are ready to do the eating, then thechildren are ready to do the eating.
However,  (15a)cannot mean that the chickens are ready to be eatenand the children are ready to do the eating.
Sentence(15b) illustrates the same point.
It is ambiguouswhether John likes to fly planes himself or whether hewould prefer someone else do the flying, but whichev-er way he likes the flying done, Bill will want it donethe same way.The following sentence from Partee \[20\] has thesame sort of ambiguity as (15a) and (15b) above; Iwill use it to illustrate how such ambiguities are dealtwith in my scheme of representation.
(16) The prosecutor believed that he wouldwin the case, and so did the defenseattorney.The missing verb phrase can be understood in twoways, either that the defense attorney would win orthat the prosecutor would win.
This can be explainedin terms of my representation, as shown in (17a) and(17b) below.
Note that he-1 is co-descriptive with thesubject role in (17a) and with the-prosecutor-1 in(17b).
Thus (17a) represents the sloppy attributiveinterpretation where he-1 refers to whatever the sub-ject happens to be, whereas (17b) represents the non-sloppy referential interpretation where he~l refers tothe-prosecutor-1 in both conjuncts.142 Amer ican  Journa l  of Computational Linguistics, Vo lume 7, Number  3, Ju ly -September  1981Will iam A.

(18a) My uncle, who is 70, is bald.
non-restrictive(18b) My uncle who,is 70 is bald.
restrictiveSentence (18a) has a non-restrictive relative clause,"who is 70", modifying, "my uncle".
That is, "who is70" is not used to pick out the uncle who is bald, butjust to give extra information about him.
This sen-tence is equivalent to the conjunction, "My uncle isbald & my uncle is 70."
By contrast, in the restrictivereading (18b), "who is 70" picks out a particular un-cle.
The distinction between (18a) and (18b) can becaptured as follows.
( 19 a ) n on- restrictive/IlK discourse-1/ t I %.~I I I ~/ i my-uncle-my-uncle-1 subject-of my-uncle-is-bald-1" Q ,, 'who-is-70'-1II % %who-1 subject-of- 'who-is-70'-1(19b) ..~ discourse.1 restrictive/ I 1t I/ It Iuncle-1 /my-uncle-who-is-70-1my-uncle-1//JS'/my-uncle-J ~ is-bald-1IIi subject-ofmy-uncle-is.bald-1%,.Q who-is-70-1//J/twho-1 subject-of-'who-is-70'-1Note that the head of the relative clause must beeither attributive or referential for both main and rela-tive clauses.
It is not possible to have (20), for exam-ple.
This argues that the relative pronoun "who"should be treated as a co-descriptor of a sentence roleof the main clause, not a discourse role.
(20) *The President, who has been marriedsince 1945, has lived in the White Housesince 1800.4.
Discourse I terat ionWe have seen that explicit nesting of structuraldescriptions can explain the referential/attributivedistinction, sloppy binding, and restrictive/descriptiverelative clauses.
This section will show that quantifierinterpretation can also be explained in a similar man-ner.
Consider sentence (21),  which is three waysambiguous, as shown in (22a)-(22c).

In each case, want-a-lion must be true foreach boy.
In (22a), a-lion-1 is attributive: it can bepicked as needed for each wanting.
In (22b), a-lion-1is referential, but it refers to a role in an iteration ofwanting at the discourse level.
(Not surprisingly, giv-en my account, this is a difficult reading for people toconstruct.)
Finally, (22c) gives the by-now-familiarreferential case where every boy is constrained towanting the same lion.
7 Let us now turn to a discus-sion of the discourse iteration construct used in (22b).
(23a) (FOR EVERY X / CLASS : (P X) ; (Q X))Every X in CLASS that satisfies Palso satisfies Q.
(23b) (FOR SOME X / CLASS : (P X) ; (Q X))Some X in CLASS that satisfies Palso satisfies Q.
(23c) (FOR GEN X / CLASS : (P X) ; (Q X))A generic X in CLASS that satisfies Palso satisfies Q.
(23d) (FOR THE X / CLASS : (P X) ; (Q X))The single X in CLASS that satisfies Palso satisfies Q.The FOR statement applies the filter P(x) in turn toeach element in the CLASS, and then applies Q(x) tothose elements that pass the filter.
The key wordsEVERY, SOME, GEN, THE, and so on, specify aparticular enumeration function.I prefer to represent quantified phrases in terms ofrole-in links (interpretable as Skolem dependencies)rather than iteration procedures, and to use predicateson intensions and sets in addition to predicates onindividuals.
By converting Woods' FOR construct omy notation, the difference between the two referen-tial readings of "every boy wants a lion" can bespelled out in more detail as shown in (24a) and (24b)below.
(Note that (24a) is a slight elaboration of(22b), and that (24b) is identical to (22c)).
(24a)captures both the EVERY and GENeric options.
Inboth cases, lions are individuated by the boys whowant them.
The individuating is represented by therole-in link (Skolem modification) from lion-1 towant-boy-l ion- 1.
(24a) Every boy wants his own lion.4.1 Procedura l  Representat ion  of  KnowledgeBy procedural representation of  knowledge, I meanknowledge in the form of procedures.
For example,the knowledge that every boy wants a lion could becast in the form "if one were to check every boy inquestion and count those who want lions, then thecount of those who want lions would be equal to thecount of the boys checked".
Woods \[30\] introduced aFOR iteration construct for representing knowledge ofquantified propositions procedurally.
8 Examples of theuse of this construct are:7 Partee \[19\] points out that this type of sentence and thoseof the previous ection pose a problem for the analysis of the indef-inite article in terms of the features +specific \[7\].
Something moreis needed to produce all the readings.
Features can be used asfollows: if a hearer has decided a node is definitely attributive itcan be marked +attributive, if it is referential the co-descriptor isshown.

Sincelions are not individuated with respect o boys, there isno motivation to introduce an iteration (or SkolemdePendency).
On this reading, "every boy wants alion" can be conceptualized just like "a boy wants alion".4.2 Collectives, Distr ibutives, and Pluralit iesIn applying predicates to pluralities, we must becareful not to confuse a predicate on a plurality with apredicate on a collective.
If a process, like wanting, isdone by a plurality, then a plurality of wantings oc-curs.
This contrasts with a collective, which acts as asingle unit.
Fauconnier \[5\] demonstrates this distinc-tion with (25).
(25a) The men {gathered, united, quarreled}, collective(25b) The men took off their hats.
distributive(25c) The men carried the couch, pluralityAs a further example, observe that in(26) Everybody gave $1000 to many of the men.we must decide whether the men receiving moneyreceive $1000 apiece or just participate in a groupreceiving $1000.
We must also decide whether"everybody" acted individually or collectively.
Notethat one cannot personally receive $1000 if $1000 isgiven to a group he is in, but one can be personallytold the news if the news is told to a group he is in.From this we see that the distributive reading may ormay not require a separate instance of some state orprocess for each individual.A plural noun group may be understood in any ofthe three ways.
Vendler \[27\] gives examples intendedto show that the choice between "each" and "every"influences our preferences.
(27) Suppose I show you a basket of apples and Itell you, "Take all of them".
If you startedto pick them one by one I should be sur-prised.
My offer was sweeping: you shouldtake the apples, if possible, "en bloc".
Had Isaid, "Take every one of them," I should notcare how you took them, provided you donot leave any behind.
If I say, "Take each ofthem," one feels that the sentence is unfin-ished.
Something like, "Take each of themand examine them in turn," is expected.Thus I expect you to take them one after theother not missing any.
"All" favors collective interpretation, but permits dis-tributive interpretation.
"Every"  favors distributiveinterpretation.
"Each" strongly favors distributiveinterpretation and favors distinct actions for each indi-vidual.4.3 Mult ip le  IterationsThe previous sections suggested that an iterationneed be constrUcted only when two descriptions in thesentence are related in a special way, e.g., where oneis individuated by the other.
Otherwise, predicates oncollectives or pluralities provide an adequate descrip-tion.
In this way, I avoid iteration, which "is relativelyexpensive from a computational  perspective.
Thereare other ways to eliminate iterations.
For example,the apparent double iteration in sentence (28a) can bereduced to a single iteration.
Formula (28b) repre-sents the natural reading where each cork is associatedwith one bottle.
It might appear that it requires twonested FOR loops as in (28c), but in fact, it can beimplemented with a single loop (28d).
(28a) Each cork is fastened to each bottle by asmall wire basket.
(28b) (?x) (Vy) if x is a cork & y is a bottle& x is the cork in bottle ythen x is fastened to y by a smallwire basket.
(28c) Forall x in corks do two nested loopsForall y in bottlesif x is the cork in bottle y thenx is fastened to y by a small wire basket.
(28d) Forall y in bottles do single looplet x = the cork in bottle yx is fastened to y by a small wire basket.Most people understand this sentence by iterating overbottles and individuating the corks by the bottles.
Thesingle loop implementation can be derived straightfor-wardly from my representation.
In some other repre-sentation, it may require a very clever compiler optimi-zation, such as "loop jamming".Sentences (29a) and (29b) are similar to (28a) inthis respect.
(29a) All the boys kissed all the girls.
(29b) Each man and each woman will be joinedin marriage here tonight.These sentences provide evidence that a quantifier like"each" doesn't necessarily set up an iteration.
It usu-ally does, and therefore these sentences are a bit odd.But these sentences are understood when each distrib-uted quantif ied expression has a discourse co-American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, Ju ly -September 1981 145William A. Martin Roles, Co-Descriptors, and the Formal Representation of Quantified English Expressionsdescription which participates in an iteration.
Settingup an iteration in (29a) and (29b) expresses the spe-cific dependence of boys on girls, and of each manand woman on each other.
(34)sail-boat motor-boat4.4 Human Processing of Quant i f ied  ExpressionsIn the previous example we could have had eachman married to each woman!
Indeed, it is not alwaysobvious how an iteration should be constructed.When someone hears the statement(30) A requirement for the course is the carv-ing of a block of wood into each of the12 designs.his reasoning might be as follows: "Well, let's see.We take the wood and carve the first design.
(Hepursues the distributive referential reading with oneblock.)
Oh!
Oh!
Now how do we carve a second de-sign, the block is used up.
Well, maybe we could fitthe twelve designs on one block, or we could cut theblock into twelve pieces.
Or maybe I should abandonthe referential reading and use twelve blocks."
Therecan be no doubt that world knowledge (pragmatics) isrequired to choose between such readings.
Considernow the following pair of sentences.
(31a) Everybody at MIT knows a dialect of LISP.
(31b) Everybody at I JCAI  knows a dialect of LISP.Everyone at a university might conceivably know thesame specific dialect, while everyone at an internation-al conference might not.Van Lehn \[26\] reports that when people are givena sentence like(32) A quick test confirmed that every drugwas psychoactive.they claim they understand it, but are then unable tostate whether there was one test per drug or only onetest for all.
This ambiguity can be expressed in predi-cate calculus using quantifiers.
(33a) (\] test) (V drug) C(test, drug)(33b) (?
drug) (3 test) C(test, drug)But in my representation, the ambiguity is representedby the presence or absence of a role-in link, whichmakes it easy to delay disambiguation.
There is noshuffling of quantifiers to shift between the two inter-pretations; instead, disambiguation is achieved by sim-ply inserting a role-in link, when and if appropriate.4.5 Ambiguity and GeneralityThe problem with (32) arises in part because of thedifficulty of distinguishing between a general expres-sion and an ambiguous one.
For example,illustrates that both a sail boat and a motor boat canbe described by the general expression boat.
Thiscontrasts with(35) = = pronoun-mine mineral-minewhere there is no generalization of the pronoun-mineand mineral-mine senses of "mine".
Finally,(36) A quick test confirmed?
th~t every drug// / / /%', , , , , ,~,~ psy c h o act iveforall drugs forsome testforsome test forall drugspoints out that it is uncertain whether "a quick testconfirmed that every drug was psychoact ive" has ageneral sense.
The general sense of "boat"  is resolvedsemantically - -  by choosing between more specificconcepts such as "sailboat" or "motorboat" .
If (35)does have a general sense it might be resolved seman-tically, but it might also be resolved pragmatically - -by binding the concept into the discourse structure indifferent ways.
Philosophers have largely ignored thisissue since they have been interested in formal lan-guages whose terms are logically unambiguous.
VanLehn's results would tend to indicate that people dohave a general sense of this expression.The advantage of the representational scheme pro-posed here is that it allows the resolution of ambiguityby incremental ly adding to what is already present.We have discussed many reasons why scoping deci-sions should be delayed, ranging from computationaleff iciency to Van Lehn's  empirical observations.Role-in links provide a simple way to accomplish this.5.
Conclus ion:  The Asymmetry  of RolesRoles introduce a very interesting asymmetry.
Inmy representation, the meaning of a node depends onits roles in more aggregate entities, not just on itsconstituents.
For example, I use role-in links as Sko-lem modifiers where others have employed quantifierscope.
In this way, I can represent quantificationaldependencies a8 role-in links to nodes representingmore aggregate ntities.
I have argued that roles are anatural device for explaining many linguistic and philo-sophical distinctions, and they are convenient for com-putational processing.Section 3 showed how roles can help representreferring expressions.
The referential /attr ibutive dis-146 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981Will iam A. Martin Roles, Co-Descriptors, and the Formal Representation of Quantified English Expressionstinction was formulated in terms of roles so that theattributive use asserts something as a role in such-and-such whereas the referential use asserts something asbeing the such-and-such without a role dependency.
Ichoose to use roles where others (e.g.
Moore) haveemployed scope dependencies, because the ambiguitypersists even when the scoping context is unavailable,as in "The president has owned a terrier since Febru-ary".
In this way, I can delay the binding decisionbecause I can represent the dependencies (or lackthereof) without hypothesizing an outer context.Furthermore, I have argued that verb phrase dele-tion provides additional support for the claim that roledependencies are associated with references, not withcontexts.
That is, in a sentence like "The prosecutorbelieved that he would win the case, and so did thedefense attorney",  there are two ways to interpret"he": as a co-descriptor of the subject or as a co-descriptor of the prosecutor.
Note that whichever wayit is taken in the first conjunct, it will be taken thesame way in the second.
There is a natural explana-tion for this if the co-description dependency is associ-ated with the reference "he",  whereas in a systemwhere this dependency was associated with the con-text, an ad hoc stipulation would be required.Section 4 argued that quantif ier dependenciesshould be associated with references as opposed tocontexts.
My approach leads to a natural representa-tion for collectives, distributives, and pluralities.
Byminimizing the differences in the representation ofthese three cases, an interpreter is in a better positionto delay binding decisions.
This is consistent with VanLehn's empirical observations.
Furthermore collec-tives and pluralities can be interpreted without itera-tion, saving considerable processing effort.References  and Related Work1.

Mar t inWilliam A. Martin, Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering andComputer Science and in the Sloan School of Management at MIT and a long-timemember of the Association for Computational linguistics, died Tuesday, June 2, 1981,after an extended illness.
He was 43.Bill Martin managed to crowd into an all-too-short life three distinct researchcareers.
After receiving his doctorate from MIT, he, in association with Joel Moses, ledthe MACSYMA development project.
MACSYMA, a computer system for appliedmathematicians, has become one of the few large applied-AI systems that have ever-growing user communities.
He then switched into the field of automatic programming,where he was responsible for developing the PROTOSYSTEM automatic programmingsystem.
This effort culminated in the development of HIBOL, a high-level business-oriented language.
Changing fields once again, Bill became an expert in computationallinguistics, concentrating on problems in parsing and knowledge representation.Bill's involvement with computational linguistics was triggered by the need heperceived for a natural language interface to PROTOSYSTEM.
His early efforts in thisarea began with an investigation of the structure of dialogues.
This led to the develop-ment of first MAPL and later OWL as formal languages for representing knowledge ofEnglish, of the application domain, and of PROTOSYSTEM's procedures.
Subsequent-ly, the problems of English language processing came to be the focal point of his work,motivating his full concentration on computational linguistics during the last few years.Bill's foremost alents were his ability to acquire an immense knowledge of both themost significant and the most intricate problems of any domain that he chose to focuson and his ability to forge and maintain a large coherent research project.
His attentionhas alternated between these two somewhat dissimilar motifs, as individual researcherand as project head.
He was a first-rate engineer throughout, one who believed and putinto practice the notion that good engineering principles could be used to resolve allscientific and application problems.
Believing in the notion of a "small infinity," Billdemonstrated, on many occasions, that seemingly unbounded problems will succumb tothe careful analysis of their hundreds of cases, when the "infinity" of their complexity isindeed only on the order of hundreds.Bill was a native of Oklahoma City, graduating from Northwest Classen High School,where he made his mark as a wrestler as well as a student.
He was an Oklahoma statewrestling champion, and continued his active interest in athletics as an undergraduate atMIT, where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity.
He received the bachelor's,master's, and PhD degrees from MIT in 1960, 1962, and 1967, respectively, all inelectrical engineering, and was appointed to the MIT faculty in 1968.He survived by his wife, Susan Y. Forbes Martin; three children, Jamie, Tad, andJon; his parents Earl and Barbara Martin of Oklahoma City; and a sister Jane AnneSlane, also of Oklahoma City.
A memorial fund has been established in ProfessorMartin's name by the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science atMIT.
It will award an annual prize for the best MIT undergraduate hesis in computerscience.148 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981
