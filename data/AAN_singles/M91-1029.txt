PRC Inc:DESCRIPTION OF THE PAKTUS SYSTEM USED FOR MUC- 3Bruce LoatmanPRC In c1500 Planning Research Driv eMcLean, VA 22102loatman_bruce@po.gis.prc .comBACKGROUNDThe PRC Adaptive Knowledge-based Text Understanding System (PAKTUS) has been under development as a nIndependent Research and Development project at PRC since 1984 .
The objective is a generic system of tools ,including a core English lexicon, grammar, and concept representations, for building natural language processin g(NLP) systems for text understanding.
Systems built with PAKTUS are intended to generate input to knowledg ebased systems or data base systems .
Input to the NLP system is typically derived from an existing electroni cmessage stream, such as a news wire .
PAKTUS supports the adaptation of the generic core to a variety of domains :JINTACCS messages, RAINFORM messages, news reports about a specific type of event, such as financia ltransfers or terrorist acts, etc., by acquiring sublanguage and domain-specific grammar, words, conceptual mappings ,and discourse patterns .
The long-term goal is a system that can support the processing of relatively long discourse sin domains that are fairly broad with a high rate of success .APPROACHPAKTUS may be viewed from two perspectives .
In one view it is seen as a generic environment for buildin gNLP systems, incorporating modules for lexical acquisition, grammar building, and conceptual templatespecification.
The other perspective focuses on the grammar, lexicon, concept templates, and parser alread yembedded within it, and views it as an NLP system itself .
The early emphasis in developing PAKTUS was on thos ecomponents supporting the former view.
The grammar and lexicon that form the common core of English, as wel las the stock of generic conceptual templates, entered PAKTUS primarily as a side effect of the testing of extension sto the NLP system development environment.
More recent work has focused on extending the linguistic knowledg ewithin the overall architecture, such as prepositional phrase attachment, compound nominals, temporal analysis, an dmetaphorical usage, and on adapting the core to particular domains, such as RAINFORM messages or news reports .The first step in this project was an evaluation of existing techniques for NLP, as of 1984 .
This evaluatio nincluded implementing rapid prototypes using techniques as in [1], [2], [3], and [4] .
Judging that no one techniquewas adequate for a full treatment of the NLP problem, we adopted a hybrid approach, breaking the text understandingprocess into specialized modules for text stream preprocessing, lexical analysis, including morphology, syntacti canalysis of clauses, conceptual analysis, domain-specific pattern matching based on an entire discourse (e .g., a new sreport), and final output-record generation .Knowledge about word morphology was drawn from [5] and is represented as a semantic network, as is lexica land semantic knowledge in general .
The grammar specification has been based on our analysis of message text, an ddraws from [5], [6], and [7] .
It was first implemented as an augmented transition network (ATN), using a linguisti cnotation similar to that in [4] .
This implementation relies on an interactive graphic interface to specify and debuggrammar rules.
More recent investigations focus on alternative formalisms .Our conceptual analysis combines aspects of conceptual dependency [1], [8], case grammar [9], semanti cpreferences [10], and psychology [11] .
We provided a feedback loop from the conceptual analyzer to the syntacticparser for faster, more accurate analysis .
We have found empirically that the current parser usually runs in lineartime (on a Sun 3/260, about 0 .1 second per word, regardless of sentence length) .
This is a result of the feedbacktogether with "look ahead" tests at critical decision points .
Those infrequent sentences requiring more time areterminated by the parser, which returns the longest parsed substring, or a run-on analysis .
The resultant loss o frecall is more than compensated for in increased system throughput .
MUC-3 corpus sentences that PAKTUS parse scompletely (about 47% of the total corpus) average about two seconds of parse time, compared to about ten second seach for partial and run-on parses (about 51% of the total corpus) .Our first version of the domain-specific discourse pattern matcher was based on [2], but a more versatile version ,based on specification-by-examples, was added during MUCK 2 development .
This uses clause, sentence, and noun191phrase semantic and syntactic patterns, and was used again in MUC-3 .
We have begun implementing discourse-leve lpattern matching (somewhat like scripts), but this was not sufficiently developed for use in MUC-3 .In addition to these functional NLP components, PAKTUS has a broad set of development tools, includin ggrammar construction tools and debugger, a lexical acquisition interface, conceptual specification tools, domai npattern builders, and some automatic learning capabilities .
These greatly facilitated adaptation of the system to th eMUC-3 task.System ArchitecturePAKTUS integrates a variety of methods that have had some success in the past .
The architecture of th ePAKTUS-based NLP system used for MUC-3 is shown in Figure 1 .Bracketin gPhraseNormalizedSentencesPreprocessorHEADE RWords/SentencesSYNTACTI CSTRUCTURESConceptua\ConceptualCONCEPTUALTemplatesAnalysisFRAMESDiscourse Analyst:Matche rinstantiated PattemUnification, Formattin g& editin g"Unknown rootMorpholog yWildCardTemplateFigure 1 : PAKTUS Architecture used for MUC-3 .Processing begins with the arrival of an electronic stream of text, such as the MUC-3 corpus .
The first functionperformed is the decomposition of the stream of characters into individual messages, message segments, sentences ,and strings of words, based on document format specifications contained in a MUC-3 document specificatio ntemplate .
The words identified by the preprocessor are mapped into entries in the lexicon which contain informatio nabout their syntax and semantics, as illustrated in Figure 2 for the word "knows" .
The lexicon, contained in fivedatabases, contains separate information for root words ("words" in Figure 2), concepts, and surface forms o r"tokens" .
The latter are mapped into data structures based on the roots .
These mappings are contained the "parses "database of Figure 2.
Compound words and idioms are first mapped into synthetic tokens, and then processed likeother surface forms.
All this information is organized in memory in two networks : a lexical net and a concept net .These two networks are linked by conceptual associations, as illustrated in Figure 2 .
The words, concepts, an dassociations are brought into memory only as needed in processing text .
PAKTUS includes an object-oriente dDBMS that performs these lexicon operations [12] .When words are encountered that have never been seen previously by PAKTUS, it tries to analyze thesemorphologically .
The morphology module has information about approximately 250 affixes, one of which, -en, i sillustrated in Figure 3 .
It analyzes words in terms of known roots and the affixes, although some words can beadequately analyzed without any knowledge of the root (e .g., any word not in the lexicon that ends in "ology"192denotes an "information domain") .
It derives both syntactic information and semantic information, producing a ninternal PAKTUS representation .
In addition, for MUC-3, we added morphological heuristics for guessing syntacti cand semantic information in many cases, even when the root is unknown (e .g., an unrecognized word ending in"ation" might be an abstract noun) .
If all of this fails to identify the word, the system deduces as much as it canfrom the syntactic and semantic context during parsing .FXICAL DATABASES0.

The conceptual analyzer then maps the syntactic configurations into conceptua lframes (concept structures with roles filled by phrase constituents), usually resolving much ambiguity in th eprocess .
If the syntax cannot be mapped into any conceptual frame, it is rejected and the syntactic parser trie salternatives .
The first two levels of the conceptual network are shown in Figure 4 .
The conceptual roles used i nPAKTUS are shown in Figure 5 .The discourse analyzer collects all the conceptual frames for an entire narrative (i .e ., an entire news report for theMUC-3 application) and produces application-specific structures that represent the information that is to be extracte dfrom the document, based on the discourse template specifications .
These structures are then reformatted intosimulated MUC-3 data base updates (i .e ., filled templates) .
An example is given below .There are important feedback points in this process, as shown in Figure 1 .
For example, the conceptualanalyzer may notify the syntactic parser that a proposed parse is semantically unacceptable, signalling that a nalternative parse should be attempted .
This semantic testing is always invoked at the clause level, and sometime ssooner .
In addition, when confronted with two computationally expensive paths, "look ahead" procedures tha tquickly scan the sentence are invoked to decide which to try first.
For example, a past participle following a nou n193may or may not signal the beginning of a relative clause in which the noun is the direct object .
In this case, apartial conceptual analysis quickly determines whether the noun can be mapped into any concept associated with th everb.
If it cannot, the relative clause path is not pursued.

Due to the modular design of PAKTUS, these areclearly delineated and were performed by different people .
Some tasks must be initiated in sequence, but may becascaded as the corpus of text is processed, so that, except for a brief period at the beginning of the task, workproceeded in parallel .
The number of changes to various knowledge bases is summarized in Figure 6 .
The five taskswere:?Build a template specifying the formats of the input streams (dev-muc3, tstl and tst2) .
This was easy andrequired about a day to perform .
?Read in the documents and update the lexicon using the PAKTUS interactive graphic interface .
This wasrelatively easy for those words (typically nouns) that only require categorization, but not conceptual mappin gspecifications (as verbs do).
The latter has often been done successfully by relying on PAKTUS default values .
?Adapt the grammar to the sublanguage of the application .
Actually changing the grammar is easy with thePAKTUS interactive graphic tools for this, but determining what is the grammar of the sublanguage may b equite difficult, requiring much linguistic knowledge and study of the corpus .
Changes for MUC-3 were minor .
?Define the application-specific discourse templates .
This is the least developed component of PAKTUS, and th eone that will receive the most attention in continuing work, such as for MUC-4 .
For MUC-3, phrase an dsentence-level patterns were defined .
A function unified these and mapped them into the 18-slot MUC- 3templates .Specify and implement the interface to the application system (the MUC-3 template fills) .
This was tedious ,but easy compared to the other tasks .
It is strictly conventional software engineering .Before MUC-3 Added for MUC-3Words (Stems) 5448 3565Tokens 8552 4307Compounds 102 426Idioms 45 22Concepts 386 0Subconcepts 15 0Verb categories 16 0Nominal categories 398 8Adverb categories 10 0Closed categories 41 0Figure 6 : Knowledge structures added to PAKTUS for MUC-3Example of MUC-3 Document ProcessingMessage number 99 from the "testl" set, which is reprinted in Appendix H, will be used to illustrat ePAKTUS's operation for MUC-3 .
PAKTUS processes text sequentially, first stripping off the document header ,then identifying sentences, which are processed syntactico-semantically one at a time, after which all the results arepassed to the discourse component .Figure 7 shows the raw, unprocessed text of the first sentence, followed by the preprocessed sentence, in whic hword boundaries have been identified .
Note that "Soviet Union" is treated as a single word, since it names an entit yrepresented in the lexicon .The lexical analysis of this sentence is shown in Figure 8 .
Each word has one or more senses, represented as aroot symbol, which is generally the concatenation of the English token, the " A" character, and the PAKTUS lexicalcategory (e .g., "ReportA Monotrans"), or as a simple structure involving a root, lexical category, inflectional mark ,and sometimes a conceptual derivation (e .g .
the structure "(Report^Monotrans L^Effect-mark Base C^It-got) "represents the adjective sense of "reported") .
For each word, all senses in the PAKTUS lexicon are fetched or derive dat this time; disambiguation is generally delayed until the syntactic and semantic phases.
An exception in this195example is the word "tonight" which has been replaced by the date from the dateline of this MUC-3 news report .The syntactic and conceptual analyses of this sentence are shown in Figures 9 and 10, respectively .
Note thatconceptual structures are produced for some nouns (e .g ., "embassies"), not just for verbs.I*** raw sentence :POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT TERRORISTS TONIGHT BOMBED TH EEMBASSIES OF THE PRC AND THE SOVIET UNION .

It is fairly representative of our work focus in MUC-3, in that some slots are filled in correctly, someincorrectly (e .g., location), and some ignored (e .g ., perpetrators), due to the limits of our development in thi sapplication.POLIE HAVE REPORTED THAT TERRORISTS TONIGHT BOMBED THE\EMBASSIES OF THE PRC AND THE SOVIET UNION.

This shows the syntactic analysis of a sentence from one of the "test2" reports .It contains three words that can not be derived from the PAKTUS lexicon: "Estevez", "MPTL", and "supposed" .PAKTUS made assumptions about each word, based on morphology and syntactico-semantic context.
It was able toproduce a reasonably accurate parse, by guessing that "Estevez" is a Spanish name, and recognizing that "MPTL" i sa noun in apposition with the preceding noun phrase, and that "supposed" must in this case be a passive voic emonotransitive verb.POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT TERRORISTS TONIGHT BOMBED TH EEMBASSIES OF THE PRC AND THE SOVIET UNION .Conceptual frame :(CAAssert ("RAAgentO9" (F409 ( " Head1 0" Police^Specialist)) )("RAProposition93 "(CA Damage ("RA AgentO5" (F405("Head06" (Terro rAEmotion LAUser SAS C AUses))) )("R AAffected95 "(CAAttend ( "Head03" (EmbassyABuilding LABuilding S AS) )("RAFocus96 "(F396 ("Head01" ChinaANation)("Conj97" (F397 (" Head98" RussiaANation)))("Conjoiner00" AndAConj)))(" RAPlace95" "@F395") (" R APlace95" "@F395")) )("RAOpponent95 "(CAAttend ("Head03" (Embass yABuilding LABuilding S AS))("RAFocus96"(F396 ("Head01" ChinaANation )( "Conj9 7 " (F397 ( "Head9 8 " RussiaANation)) )("ConjoinerOO" AndAConj)) )("RAPlace95" "@F395") ("RAPlace95" "@F395")))("RAWhen-adv94" ("25-Oct-1989" LATime-date Base)))) )Figure 10: Conceptual analysis of the first sentence .
