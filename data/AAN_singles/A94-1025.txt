beAbst ractIn this paper, we want to describe the ar-chitecture and some of the implementationissues of a large scale category guesser forDutch medical vocabulary.
We Mso providenumerical data on the precision and cover-age of this category guesser, which has tocover for the moment only the vocabularyof the cardiology domain.
The categoryguesser uses non-morphologic information(endstring matching) as well as truly mor-phologic knowledge (inflection, derivationand compounding).
Since we deal witha sublanguage some linguistic features areeasier to handle (Grishman and Kittredge,1986), (Sager et al, 1987).
Subsequentlywe will describe in detail the differentsparts which interact o successfully identifyunknown medical words.1 In t roduct ion1.1 NLP in medic ineMedical patient reports consists mainly of free text,combined with results of various laboratories.
Whilenumerical data can easily be stored and processed forarchiving and research purposes, free text is ratherdifficult to be treated by computer, although it con-tains the most relevant information.
Several authorsput forward the hypothesis that Natural LanguageProcessing (NLP) and Knowledge Representation(KR) of medical discharge summaries have becomethe key-issues in the domMn of intelligent medical in-formation processing (Baud et al, 1992), (Gabrieliand Speth, 1987), (McCray, 1991).
However, only afew NLP-driven systems have actually been imple-mented (Friedman and Johnson, 1992) .
For Dutch,a limited prototype has been developed (Spyns,1991), (Spyns and Adriaens, 1992).
A broader sys-tem covering a larger part of the Dutch grammar andmedical vocabulary is currently under development?150This activity forms part of the MENELAS-project 1?
This project comprises a morphological, syntactic,semantic and pragmatic analysis of the medical sub-language for Dutch, English and French (Spyns etal., 1992).
The project also focuses on KnowledgeRepresentation (by means of Conceptual Graphs)(Sowa, 1984), (Volot et al, 1993) and ProductionSystems (Bouaud and Zweigenbaum, 1992).1.2 The Category Guesser for DutchMedical LanguageThis paper focuses on the morphological and lex-ical component of the system, which is a combi-nation of a database application and a Prolog ruleinterpreter.
This component is already functioningand is used continuously during the current exten-sion of the coverage of the Dutch grammar (Spynset al, 1993).
The importance of morphologic analy-sis of medical vocabulary has been widely recognised(Wingert, 1985), (Wolff, 1984), (Dujols et al, 1991),(Pacak and Pratt, 1969) (Pacak and Pratt, 1978),(Norton, 1983)?In the following sections, we will describe the dif-ferent parts which interact o identify the word formsof a given sentence?
The various stages of the anal-ysis of the word forms are described?
A major dis-tinction can be made between forms "known by thesystem" (= stored in the dictionary cf.
section 2) andunknown forms whose linguistic characteristics needto be computed and are hypothetical.
The lattercan be based on morphologic knowledge (section 3)or other heuristics (sections 4, 5 ~z 6).
Each sectionis illustrated by an example or some implementationdetails.
A schematic overview of the architecture ofthe category guesser is presented in section 7.
Thesubsequent section (8) is devoted to the evaluation,which will guide the further elaboration of the heredescribed category guesser.
The paper ends with aconclusion and discussion (section 9).1The MENELAS-project (AIM #2023) is financed bythe Directorate General XIII of the European Commu-nity (Zweigenbaum and others, 1991).\ [ lex :geprobeerd ,n l lu :geprobeerd ,cat :n ,nb :s ing ,pers :3 \ ]\ [ lex :geprobeerd ,n l~u:geprobeerd ,cat :ad j ,ad j type :ord ,ad j~:no \ ]\[lex:geprobeerd,nllu:proberen,cat:v,pers:nil,nb:nil,tense:nil,vform:pastpart\]\[lex:geprobeerd,nllu:proberen,cat:adj,adjtype:papa,adj~:no\]\[~ex:gepr~beerd~n~u:gepr~beerden~ca~:v~pers:ni~nb:ni~tense:ni~vf~rm:pastpart\]\[lex:geprobeerd,nllu:geprobeerden,cat:adj,adjtype:papa,adj~:no\]\[lex:geprobeerd,nllu:geproberen,cat:adj ,adjtype:papa,adj~:no\]\[lex:geprobeerd,nllu:geprobeerden,cat:v,pers:1,nb:sing,tense:pres,vform:finite\]Figure 1: Example of Cohort for "geprobeerd"2 Fu l l  Form D ic t ionaryThe lexical database for Dutch was built using sev-eral resources: an existing electronic valency dic-tionary and a list of words extracted from a medi-cal corpus (cardiology patient discharge summaries).The already existing electronic dictionary (resultingfrom the K.U.
Leuven PROTON-project (Dehaspeand Van Langendonck, ) and the newly coded entrieswere converted and merged into a common represen-tation in a relational database (Dehaspe, 1993).It is intended to use the category guesser (cf.
infra)as little as possible.
To that extent, the dictionary isconceived as a full-form dictionary.
Currently, thereare some 100.000 full forms in the lexical database(which is some 8000 non inflected forms).
How-ever, since an exhaustive dictionary is an unrealisticassumption, a category guesser handles all the un-known word forms.The unknown words trigger a set of rules to iden-tify the surface form, to attribute syntactic cate-gories to it, and to calculate the possible canoni-cal form(s).
The category guesser can also enhancethe robustness of the larger NLP-system since mis-spelled words can receive, to a certain extent, cor-rect syntactic features.
To reach this aim, the cat-egory guesser combines morphologic (3) as well asnon morphologic knowledge (sections 4 & 6).3 Morpho log ica l  Ana lys i s3.1 P re l iminary  RemarksThe morphological nalyser consists mainly of threesections, which correspond more or less to the threelinguistic operations on words: inflection, derivationand compounding.
However, from an implementa-tional point of view, the boundaries between deriva-tion and compounding are defined in a different way.The compounds, created by agglutination or com-bined by means of a hyphen are computationallytreated as non-compounds.
This implies that thesame segmentation routine can be used for the com-putation of derivations and monolithical compounds(Spyns and De Wachter, 1995).1513.2 In f lec t ionThe inflection analyser produces one or more bun-dles of morphosyntactic feature value pairs for eachsubmitted surface form (= cohort).
The generatedfeature bundles comprise, among other features, thesurface form (lex), the supposed canonical form(nlAu) as well as its category (cat) 2 A reducedexample of the cohort produced for "geprobeerd"(Eng.
: "tried")follows (see figure 1).The initial cohort will later on be reduced as muchas possible (the ideal result in most cases being a sin-gle feature bundle).
Therefore, a cascading prioritysystem has been defined.
The attribute "mort" ex-presses the quality of the analysis, possible valuesbeing segm, suffix, string or guess with segm > suf-fix > string > guess.
More details on this will begiven below.Only the feature bundles of supposed nouns,verbs, adjectives and adverbs (i.e.
the open cate-gories) are admitted in the initial set of hazardousanalyses or cohort.3.3 Segmentat ionDerivation and monolithical compounding are usedto try and identify as many as possible of the canon-ical forms computed by the inflectional analyser.The starting principle here is that the right partof the computed canonical form usually constitutesthe grammatical head of the whole word.
Thewhole word thus inherits the feature-bundle associ-ated with its right part (Selkirk, 1982, p.150) 3In opposition to William (Williams, 1983) &Selkirk (Selkirk, 1982), we do not allow inflectionalsuffixes to be heads.
The right part can be found inthe dictionary (monolithical compounding) or in alist of suffixes (derivation).
In the current segmen-tation program, the major part of this list containsmedical suffixes, which constitute a clearly definable2v for verbs, adj for adjectives and n for noun; othersare nb \[sing or phr\] for number, pers \[1, 2, 3 or nil\] forperson.3We are fully aware that linguistic reality is morecomplex: e.g.
some derivations (f.i.
Dutch diminutifscf.
(Ritchie et al, 1992)) are regarded as left headed.Maybe they should be treated computationally by theinflectional analyser.set that is fairly regular in its (morphological ndsyntactic) behaviour (Dujols et al, 1991).
Below(see figure 2) one can find an extract of the suffixlist.su f f i x  ( \[a, r ,  i ,  s \ ] ,  \ [cat  : ad j ,  nb: sing\] ) .su f f i x  ( \[a, a, 1 \ ] ,  \ [cat  : adj,nb : sing\] ) .suff ix ( \[i, e\] , \[cat : n, nb: s in~ ).Figure 2: Examples of Suffixes with Feature BundleThe computed canonical form is scanned and seg-mentated from right to left.
All possible solutionsare generated by a failure driven loop (no exclusivelongest match principle).
The segmentation rou-tine which tries to identify a right part (head:dict orhead:suffix) and then tries to recognize the remain-ing left part.
If this succeeds, the segmentation iscomplete (morf:segm).
Otherwise, it is only partial(morf: suffix).At the moment, only noun noun compounds aretreated.
Many medical noun noun compounds com-bine a medical non head part with a non medicalhead part (f i .
hartziekte- Eng.
: heartdisease).Only those feature bundles of the cohort are keptthat are compatible (by means of graph-unification)with the feature bundle associated with the headpart (suffix or dictionary entry).
At this stage offiltering, the feature cat (syntactic ategory) plays amost prominent role.4 Endstr ing MatchingWhen nothing can be predicted by means of mor-phology, another heuristic will be applied to reducethe set of remaining possible morphological nalyses.This stage will focus more on the general anguagewords.
It is based on a series of endstrings (not lim-ited by morphological boundaries) which determinethe category of a word.
Only the open syntacticclasses are taken into account (noun, verb, adjectiveand adverb).
Some endstrings uniquely identify thecategory of a word while others are more equivocal.The latter are correlated with two or even three cat-egories.
The necessary linguistic knowledge to builda list of non-inflected endstrings and their associ-ated category (or categories) was found in Lemmens(Lemmens, 1989).
Some combinations of an end-string and its category are shown below (see figure3).When a computed lexical form is presented tothe endstring matcher, the above mentioned list ischecked to see if an endstring constitutes the endpartof the submitted word.
In fact, the surface form aswell as the hypothetical canonical form of the fea-ture bundle are submitted to the endstring matcher.Only the categories resulting of both matching pro-cesses (= the intersection) are finally retained.

Below(see figure 4) the result of endstring matching ap-plied to the verb "geprobeerd" (Eng.
: "tried") isshown (rule with ending -eerd applies) 4The inflection rules were able to produce a canon-ical form together with its category which the end-string matcher considers correct.
This implies thatthe inflection rule was correctly triggered and ap-plied.
As a corollary, the other syntactic informationin such a validated feature bundle (with morf:string)is supposed to be correct as well.
However, manysyntactic features are underspecified 55 Default or Catch All RuleIf none of the aforementioned cases apply, the com-puted canonical forms and its corresponding gram-matical features are pure guesses.
The complete co-hort is retained and each of its feature bundles isextended with one extra feature morf: guess.6 F inal  select ion of the  set ofso lut ionsAfter the stages mentioned above, only a subset offeature bundles of the cohort will contain the fea-ture morf.
All of these feature bundles contain mor-phosyntactic information that is validated by thementioned heuristics (cf.
supra) 6 This subset isretained and passed to the syntactic parser.
Whensegmentations of both types (complete versus par-tial) are produced, the latter (morf:suffix) are dis-carded in favour of the former (morf:segm).
In thatcase, endstring matching nor the catch all rule isapplied.7 Schematic OverviewBelow, one can find a more formal description anda schematic overview (see figure 5) of the categoryguesser.4We assume of course that the verb does not appearin the dictionaries.5The Syntactic analyser requires the presence of somelinguistic features - -  even when underspecified - -  in thefeature bundle.SWhen the default rule applied, the subset will beidentical to the complete cohort.
Validation is a toostrong word in this case.\[lex:geprobeerd,cat:adj,nllu:proberen,adjtype:papa,adj~:no,morf:string\]\[lex:geprobeerd,cat:adj ,nllu:geproberen,adjtype:papa,adj~:no,morf:string\]\[lex:geprobeerd,cat:v,nllu:proberen,vform:pastpart,vtype:main,morf:string\]\[lex:geprobeerd,cat:v,nllu:geproberen,vform:pastparZ,vtype:main,morf:string\]Figure 4: Endstring Matching Applied to "geprobeerd"Input:Data :Functioh:\[lex:W\] the unknown surface form WFDAG: the linguistic information (feature bundle) associated with FFDAG = \[nl_lu:W', cat:x, nb:y, ...\]DDAG: the dictionary entry of a canonical form W'DDAG = \[nl_lu:W', cat:x, frame:z, ...  \]EDAG: the linguistic information (feature bundle) associated with an endmorphemeEDAG = \[cat:x, head:dict,...\] or EDAG = \[cat:x, head:suffix,...\]RDAG: the category provided by the endstringmatcherRDAG = \[cat:x\]~" : maps W to a hypothetical canonical form W' (inflection rule)H : unifies two feature bundles81: segmentates W'  in a left part (L) and endmorpheme (E)82: segmentates L in several morphemes (L1,.. .

The to-tal number of unknown words was 2832.
Manualcategorisation revealed the presence of 679 adjec-tives, 2056 nouns, 82 verbs.
The 2832 unique un-known forms lead to the generation of 6342 supposedanalyses, which means that for every unknown form2.4 possible canonical forms are retained.
We con-sider the case when an unknown surface form re-ceives more than two different categories as a guess.Guesses are always interpreted as bad.
If the cate-gory guesser is not able to attribute a correct cate-gory, the result is regarded as bad.
Once a correctcategory, even concurrently with an incorrect one,is assigned to the submitted word, the outcome isperceived as good.
7 As the main concern lies withthe syntactic haracteristics, we did not consider anerroneously calculated canonical form as a reason toreject the complete feature bundle.
Manual exami-nation of the results permits us to state that 83.4 %of the unknown forms are correctly identified.
Weconsider the result as fairly good and are convincedthat refinements can lead to an even better result.The linguistic coverage can be still be improved byadding rules in order to treat comparatives and su-perlatives.9 DiscussionA choice was to be made between keeping more po-tential analyses likely to be correct versus restrict-ing the cohort to one (or a limited set of) analy-sis which may be incorrect.
As a general strategy,we prefer to restrict as early as possible the searchspace on all the levels of the language understandingsystem.
Otherwise useless hypotheses will be prop-agated through the whole system causing a combi-natorial explosion.
However, this attitude can leadto the rejection of valid solutions and, in the worstcase, can be responsible for a complete failure of thelanguage understanding system.A possible optimisation resides in the storage ofthe medical suffixes and endstrings in their inflectedforms.
They could be integrated in the already ex-isting full form dictionary.
In order to acceleratethe decomposition phases, the morphemes or stringscould be stored in reversed order.These reorganisations of the data structures alsoinfluence the high level algorithm (cf.
section 7).Since all the words, suffixes and endstrings would bestored in the database as full forms, the inflectionalanalyser (cf.
section 3.2) would be merely needed for7Sometimes the surface form alone does not permitan unequivocal categorization (f.i.
in principle, a Dutchnoun formally equals the first person singular present ofa regular verb).the computation of a hypothetical canonical formand its syntactic characteristics when applying thecatch all rule.
This leads without any doubt to afaster execution of the category guesser as a whole.As a corollary, the overall architecture of the entirecomponent becomes impler and more homogeneous.ReferencesR.H.
