Machine Translation for MonolingualsMary McGee WOODDepartment ofComputer ScienceUniversity of ManchesterManchester M13 9PL U.K.Brian J. CHANDLERCentre for Computational LinguisticsUMISTManchester M60 1QD U.K.andInternational Computers LimitedAbstractWe describe sister machine translation prototypes, Ntran, anEnglish to Japanese system developed at UMIST, and Aidtrans,Japanese to English, at Sheffield, both designed for use by anEnglish monolingual.
Aidtraus uses extensive and sophisticatedcollocational analysis radically to reduce the need forconventional post-editing.
Ntran offers interactive query at threestages: on-line dictionary update, syntactic disambiguation, andJapanese lexical selection.
The second of these is described andillustrated in particular detail, and the underlying philosophy ofmonolingual interaction discussed.1.
BackgroundUnder the Alvey Directorate's research programmein natural language processing, an English-Japanese machinetranslation project was carried out at the Centre forComputational Linguistics, University of Manchester Instituteof Science and Technology and the Centre for JapaneseStudies, University of Sheffield.
The project ran from October1984 to December 1987, and was also funded by InternationalComputers Limited (ICL).
The UMIST group, led by PeterWhitelock, have developed an English-to-Japanese prototype(Ntran), while Jiri Jelinek's group at Sheffield have beenworking from Japanese into English (Aidtrans).The two prototypes, although very different insome aspects of their linguistic and computational pproaches,share an important and distinctive design philosophy.
Both areinteractive, and, unlike present commercially available machine(aided) translation systems, both are designed for end use by amonolingual speaker of English.
This paper will discuss themeans by which each system achieves this, and the issuesinvolved in tailoring a system for use by a target language orsource language speaker.2.
Aidtrans: the Sheffield Japanese-to-English systemThe Aidtrans Japanese-to-English prototype(implemented in C, and running on a Sharp Unix-basedmicrocomputer) is an implementation of a comprehensive,highly detailed and sophisticated algorithmic grammar ofJapanese developed by Dr. Jiri Jelinek as a teaching tool forrapid intensive instruction in technical Japanese (Jelinek 1978).The core of this grammar is its Integrated Dictionary System(IDS).
The philosophy of IDS is to incorporate as much aspossible of the grammar and the analysis heuristics in thedictionary.
This is done in an explici.tly language-specific, and,as applied to translation, language-parr specific form, allowinggreat accuracy and precision (at some inevitable cost inadaptability).
The dictionary of the finished prototype containsentries for some 6,000 words.While committed to the maximum use of lexiealresources, Aidtrans also sees translation as a relation overwhole texts rather than individual words or even sentences.
Thepurpose of each act of translation is to retain the global sense,rather than the concatenation of word-meanings, of a text its it760is reformulated in a different language.
To achieve this, it isclearly not enough to produce one acceptable translation foreach separate sentence of a text and adjoin them.
Just as asyntactic parser will produce alternative analyses of anambiguous sentence from which the one intended must beselected, so Aidtrans produces alternative translations of eachpart of the input text, from which the translation mostappropriate to the context must be selected.Such selection from among possible translationequivalents i familiar from human translation or post-editing.Here, however, much of the selection, or rejection, is cmTiedout by the system itself.
A text-type-specific linear predictivemodel is the basis for determining priorities or preferencesamong the possibilities.
Patterns can be recognized at thegeneral level of syntactic onfiguration and at the more specificlevel of individual exical items and collocations; at present hesystem recognizes well over 200 different types ofjuxtapositional linkage.
In other words, the selectional functionin Aidtrans is driven by a generalization of valency, augmentedwith priority weightings for the possible valency values.3.
Ntran: the UMIST English-tu-Japanese systemNtran - its design inspired by Rod Johnson, anddeveloped and first implemented largely by Peter Whitelock - isless target-specific than Aidtrans.
The prototype is implementedin Prolog for the sake of rapid and perspicuous development;versions now exist in Cprolog, New Improved (Edinburgh)Prolog, and Quintus.
During the course of development,versions have been run on a DEC MicroVax II, an ICL PERQ,and most recently a Sun 3/50 workstation.Through a system of nested menus, Ntran functionson three levels: as a system development system, a grammardevelopment system, and a translation system proper.
Eachlevel offers specific facilities for the writing, testing anddebugging of appropriate areas of program code.
(For details,see Whitelock et al1986).Although both prototypes give the maximumweight and information content o the lexicon, another point ofdifference between them is that Ntran is committed to theprinciple of translation as linguistics (cf.
Johnson 1987), anddesigned and implemented as an explicit embodiment ofcontemporary lexicalist linguistic theory.
The English analysisgrammar is based on Lexical-Functional Grammar (Bresnan, ed.1982) and Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (Gazdar et al1985), the Japanese generation grammar on CategorialGrammar (Steedman 1985, Whitelock 1987).In analysis, words are first looked up in an Englishmorpho-syntactic dictionary which specifies grarmnaticalcategory and morphologically determined features uch as tenseand number.
The entries in this, as in all dictionaries, arecompacted by "feature co-occurrence r strictions" which factorout any feature-values which are predictable on the basis ofothers.
These derive largely from the fcrs of Generalized PhraseStructure Grammar (Gazdar et al1985).
In English, forexample, any lexical item which has tense must be finite and averb.
In a lexical entry assigning any value to "tense", thespecification of finiteness and verb-hood would be redundant,and can be supplied by a generalized rule of the formft.~t(te, lse=_,\[thl=linite, stemtyp--verb\]).Shktilarly, a~ any verb has no noun features, but sets (possiblyemp!~) of Inepositional complements and adjuncts, and as any'4ng form i~ a progressive finite verb, we have rulestct (ca t=verb,\[nounfeat.s=\[\],peomp=setC),adj unct=setC)\] ).fer(nffonn-~ing,\[stemtyp=verb,aspect=progress,inf=no\]).Osiilg thi,~ l~mited information, the parser builds all possible"functional structures" (the "f-structures" of LFG), which .serveat an hlterawAiate representation abstracting away ficom surfaceconstituent structm~, a particularly valuable level when~ta~liating between a configarational language such as Englishaid a non--configurational one such as Japanese.~ second stage of lookup in the English "subeat"dictionmy, which holds possible subeategorization patterns,elinilnates spurious f-slxuctures, and provides a semanticirtterpretatioo ("s-structure") for those which remain.
(Cf Woodut al 1.987.)
S-structure forms the basis for transfer, driven bybilingual dictionaries, the only component to hold contrastiveinfol-mation.
The resulting Japanese s-structure is the basis forgeneration of a Japanese f-structure, using syntactic informationheld in the bilingual and Japanese dictionaries in the form ofthe eomple?
categories and combination rules of a unificationcatcgorild grammar (see Whitelock 1988 for details).
Surfaceordering of the Japanese output is finally carried out by linearprecedence rules.
"lTae role and form of user interaction will bediscussed below.4.
Techniques for interactive translationAs mentioned earlier, both Aidtrans and Ntran aredesigned for an English monolingual end-user.
This approach -reflected in the joint project's Alvey title, "Read and writeJapanese without knowing it" - distinguishes them fromcun'ently commercially available machine (aided) translationsystems~ and has led to a nmnber of distinctive designdecisions.4ol Aidtcanslu the case of Aidtrans, the intention was, whileleaving the lhml selection of the exact translation to the end-user, to prod,ace output of greater accuracy and coherence thanis generally Jbund in current post-editing systems.
The strategyof multiple l;eneration produces a set of complete alternativetranslations, 3uther than one which nmst be amended piecemealby a posteditur, while the text-type-based predictive model andpreference-weighted linkages cut down greatly on the rangeactually offeled to the end-user, and group those which surviveinto semantically and stylistically coherent wholes.
Thus, whilea conventional posteditor needs access to the source text tocheek the accuracy of raw output and as a guide to its revision,hexv~ enough information is available in the output to form thebasis of the end-user's final selection.4.2 NtranThe facilities for, or demands on, the end-user ofNtran me somewhat more complex: both the complexity of thetask and the inner ariienlation of the system are greater, givingboth the ne~d and the opportunity for a variety of interactions(~1' Jotmson & Whitelock 1987).
'lb ensure to an Englishmor, olinl~al technical writer file output of accurate andacceptable ~vpanese, the conventionalstrategy would be pre-editing, passing to the mactgut~ only text in a restricted sub-lalguag~ known to be with~ its translation capacity.
Oursystem ca)uk~ perhaps be said to offer interactive pre-editinghatedeavCd with translation, rather than interactive translationpaotscr, as ~o contcastive or bilingual information is presentedto the end user hi the interaction.
The restricted input sub-language, however, is simply grammatical English, which ifa~nbig~ons must be disambiguated.
This should be seen not asa constraint c~n a technical writer but as a desideratum.The Ntran prototyl~ is designed to offer threetorms of interactive query: onYlfiae dictionary creation, syntacticdisambiguadon of English input, and Japanese lexieal selectionin transfer.4.2.1 Dictionary updateWhen a word is found in an input text for whichno dietionaly entry yet exists, the user is offered the option ofcreating an entry for it immediately.
This is done using a tree-structured question procedure, eliciting the category of theEnglish word and its values for the features associated with thatcategory, such as mass/count and animacy for nouns, valencyand aspectual type for verbs, gradability for adjectives, and soon.
The on-line dictionary building routine, although itincorporates a reasonable range of information about an Englishword, does not ask for Japanese translation equivalents.
Instead,entries created in this way are held in a separate dictionary file,where they are aceessible to the analysis component, but alsoset aside for later completion by a bilingual inguist.Until this is done the English word is at presentsimply passed into the Japanese output in its original form,marked off by a special delimiting character.
We intend toimplement in a fnrther developed version of the system afacility for passing through such words in katakanatranscription.
Given a reasonable core dictionary, most newwords will be specialized technical terms, for which this will infact be the correct rendering.4.2.2 Syntactic disambiguationSyntactic ambiguities in the English input are alsoreferred to the user for dismnbiguation.
The parser fnrst builds asurface syntactic dependency structure, or functional structure,which is then mapped to a deep or semantic structure, and arecord kept of the mappings ('obj', for example, is mapped to'argO').
During this mapping stage, a record is also kept, foreach well-formed s-structure produced, of the set of mappingsentailed by the subeategofization requirements of the lexicalitems involved.
Each mapping records the derived semanticrelation which is assigned between a constituent and its parent.Examples of "maptrace" are given with the examples below.The disanlbiguation module then computes a set ofdifferences among all the recorded mapping sets and builds aset of all those relations which are true for only a subset of theparses.
These are then presented to the user, after conversion ofsome of the internal semantic relation names to external nameswhich are intended to be more immediately understandable.The generator for the user-form representation f mappings is:deseribeas(map(X,Y,Z),\[X,' is ' C,' of ',Z\]) :-logtocase(Y,C),!.logtocase(argO,objec0.logtocase(argl,agen0.logtocase(ben,beneficiary).logtocase(loc,location).logtocase(rep,representation).logtocase(instr,instmment).logtocase(adj unet,modifier).logtocase(X,X).It should be noted that this mechanism suceesfully representsboth purely structural ambiguities uch as prepositional phraseattachment, and also subeategorization ambiguities, as in "writeon the deck of the ship", where "deck" could be either thelocation or object of "write".The alternatives are presented as a set of statementsdistinctively characterizing thepossible semantic interpretations,as can be seen in the examples below.
The user responds withthe number of  any statement which is true, or 'T' followed bythe number of any statement which is false.761Because of a technical implementation detailcons'tituents are at present referred to only by their heads: thus,in this example set of queries, "and is object of active" means"(workstations and terminals) is object of active".
Obviouslythis aspect of the presentation could be improved in a morefully developed system.
One could also present he alternativesin quite different ways, by paraphrases of alternative readings,for example, or dependency trees or some other graphicalinterface, generated by the same underlying mechanism.4.2.3 Japanese lexical selectionFinally, ambiguities, or alternatives, may arise inthe selection of a Japanese translation equivalent for an Englishwo,d or expression.
Interactive systems standardly offer suchalternatives directly to the user, who must have somecompetence in the target language to be able to make ritechoice.
Ntran's Japanese dictionary entdes include Englishglosses, and the user will be offered these to chose between,rather than the Japanese head-words.
This facility is not yetfully implemented.5.
The system as translator and the monolingual ,~.sex ~Clearly, ensuring reliable ti'anslafion tbr ~monolingual user in either direction requires a system dt:sig~lcarefully tuned to the task.
In the ease of "import ranslation",translating into the user's language, the information content ofthe output text must be sufficiently rich that, in cases ofuncertainty, reference to the source text (the traditional recourseof the post-editor) is adequately replaced by reference to the setof coherent possibilities offered in that output.
This is exactlythe strategy implemented in Aidtrans.In the case of "export ranslation", when the user isa speaker of the source language, the system can ,'equestadditional information at a number of stages in the translationchain, to supplement the information inherent in the stafaceform of the input text, if that proves insufficient for syntacticanalysis, serrmntie interpxetafion, and/or target language lexicalselection.
(Although the obvious, and ultimate, source of suchsupplememtary information is the human end-user, we envisagethe long-teml possibility of referring queries first to intelligent,world-knowledge-based modules within the system, leaving thehuman user as a progressively less often needed safety net)Ntran's modularity of design isolates the stages of the processclearly from each other, while our commitment o theimplementation of linguistic theory offers formats for thepresentation of choices by the system and the input or'iuformation by the user which are transparent toboth.
