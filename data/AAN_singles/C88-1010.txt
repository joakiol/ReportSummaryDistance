The system of Czech-to-Russian MTsystem called RUSLAN is conceived ruimilarlyas all l inguistical ly based MT systems) as amodular system consisting (in brief) of asource language parser, a tranfer and a syn-thesis of the target language.
The task is totranslate texts from the domain of computers,in particular manuals of operating systems.Since in RUSLAN the source language is close-ly genetical ly related to the target one,some of the modules of the system could havebeen considerably simplified, not leaving outof consi4eration the theoretical l inguisticframework on which t\]~e system is based (de-pendency and stratif icatlonal approach).
Thesimplif ications concern, first of all, thetransfer phase, so that the system cannot beunderstood as including a complete transfer.2.
The effort towards a maximally effec-tive procedure has also resulted in s impl i f i -cations in the 2arser.
This was made possiblei.a.
by the similarity of cases of syntacticambiguity in the source and the target lan-guage.
For example, with sequences of thetype Verb Noun I Noun 2 ... Nouni, where eachNounj stands for a nominal or a preposit ionalgroup serving as a free modifier, the surfaceorder can general ly be preserved, which factmakes unnecessary a detailed identi f icat ionwhether any of the Noun~'s modif ies the Verbor one of the precedin~ Nouns.
This can bei l lustrated by the output Russian sentence"Vo vremja svoej raboty programma mo~et po-trebovat' tak~e pomo~6" sistemy pri obrabotkefailer dannych."
(Lit.
"In course of-lts workprogram can need also help of-system in pro-cessing of-fi les of-data.
"), where the group"pri obrabotke ..." can be analyzed (in bothlanguages) as modifying the verb "potrebovat "'or the nouns "pomo~5"" or "sistemy".
If theorder of the nominal groups is preserved, thetranslation also preserves the structuralambiguity of the original.
Also nominal lza-tions can be translated independently oftheir underlying structure (e.g.
, "Indeksno-posledovaternyje faJly neobchodimo do obra-botki preobrazovat'."
- llt. "
Index-sequentialfiles have-to-be before ~rocessi__~ transfor-med.
", or  "P rogrammy,  napisannye na JazykeAssembler v ramkach pred\[du~6e~ versi i ,  ne-obchodimo snova translirovat'."
- lit.
"Pro-grams written in language Assembler in frame-work-of ~ version have-to-be againcompiled.
").Such an approach made it possible, atfirst, to minimize the transfer phase in thedesign of the project, and then, in the pro-cess of realization, the articu\].ation oftransfer operations into the pax'ser and thesynthesis, which may lead to an impressio~that  RUSLAN works  complete \ ] .y  withouttransfer, i.e., as a direst binary NT system?In principle, it can be said that the minim:\[-zation of the transfer reflects the empiricalfast that the two languages have a lot el ~common features.3.
A great role is played in RUSLAN bythe lexicon.
The lexical entry contains maxi -~mum of information, which is then projectedto the syntactic rules; only the most generalbehaviour of words is rendered purely bymeans of syntax.The rules of choice of lexical equiva-lents include different types of information?Along with the data on parts of speech andmorphemics, semantic features are listed, and(esp.
with verbs) also the valency (subcate-gorization) frame; the valency slots are ac.--companled by information on their Czech mor-phemic form as well as that of the corres-ponding Russian items (as an example of theirdiscrepancy might serve the pair "u~ivatn~co(acc.)"
vs. "po~zovat~Ja ~em(instr?)"
--"to use stg."
).
Where pasivization is possi~ble, it is indicated which of the slots(mostly, but not always expressed by aecusa-~tire) is selected as the passive surface sub-Ject, expressed then by nominative.
With eachof the slots, the semantic features requiredor excluded for the filler of that slot areindicated.
These features help to identifythe fi l lers, especial ly in cases of ambigui ~ty, e.g.
in Czech "V~stupnl za~izenl nastavi~,dkov&nl na po~adovanou hodnotu."
(lito"Output device sets l ine-spaclng at requiredvalue ") the verb "nastavit" ("set") has thefol lowing valency frame: Actor (nom/nom~+Human ,+Device) , Objective (ace/ace ,~-Con-cr,+Result-of-process,-}luman), where "+ de ~notes semantic features such that at leastone of them has to be prescott with the fillerof the respective slot, " " denotes semanticfeatures excluded with the fil ler, and bold-print denotes Czech/Russian morphologicalforms.
In this way, the ambiguity of morphe-mic case with "~&dkov~ni" and "za~Izeni" (inboth cases between non and ace) can be solvedon the basis of semantic features of the "twonouns .3.1 The choice of the Russian equivalentsfor Czech lexical units should reflect also46structura\]  d i f fe rences  between the two lan-guageso These d i f ferences  concern also syn-tac ' i i f c  pat ' ; ;e rns ;  at least 'the fo l lowing casesshould be d ist inguished:as Adj Ad j NoUil -?~ AdJ Nouncxo:  d~,,';;ov,9 f ' fd ic~ p~ikaz-..> uprav l ja ju \ [ \ [ i j  operator\ ] .

)47The preposit ion "o" with locative in Czech iskept also in Russian or, with nouns havingthe feature Time, translated as "vo vremja"with genitive.Differences in preposit ional construct-ions are found also with the fol lowing pairs:c. Czech:Price n_~a programu pokrabuj l  i v tomto roce.Russian:Raboty nad programmoj prodol~ajuts ja i v f, tomgodu.
(The works on the program continue also thisyear.
)d.  Czech:Prhee na fakult~ pokra~uj~ i v %omto rote.Russian:Raboty na faku~tete prodol~ajuts ja i v 6tomgodu.
(The works at the faculty continue also thisyear.
)These examples cannot be fully accounted forby means of lexieal information, neither canthey be included into the general scheme ofsyntactic rules.
It is necessary to have alist of such differences.4.3 In translat ing Czech subordinateclauses introduced by such conjunctions as"zda" ,"-li" ("whether") , " jestl i~e" ("if") ,"kdy~" ("when"), "dokud" ("ti l l"), "dokud he"("until") , "pokud" ("as long as") , some ofwhich are ambiguous, the text can be treatedas relat ively homogenous.
The functioning ofa clause introduced by "zda" or "-li" as asubject can be identif ied on the basis of thevalency of the verb in superordinated clause,where it is marked whether the verb may takea subordinated clause as its Actor or Objec-tive.
In the other cases, suitable or atleast acceptable translat ions of the conjunc-tions are as follows: Czech "zda"," - l i " ,"po-kud" ,"jestli~e" as Russian "esli"; Czech "do-kud" ,"dokud he" as Russian "poka","poka ne" ,Czech "kdy~" as Russian "kogda".It follows that while it is necessaryto work "to a certain degreewith the under -lying structure, in'the major i ty of cases theequivalent can be chosen just in accordancewith the conjunct ions themselves.4.4 The Czech verb "btt" ("to be") hasseveral Russian equivalents: the copula"byt TM , verbs "est TM , " javl jat~Ja",  "naehodit usja", "imet~ja".
The select ion of the equiva-lent depends on the syntactic context: if thenominal predicate in Czech is in instrumentalease, then a form of the verb " javl jat~ja" ispreferred; if a local adverbial is present,then the translat ion "nachodit~ja" is at pla-ce, otherwise the appropriate form of thecopula is chosen; Of course, another pointconcerns the translat ion of "btt" withinidioms ("byt'v porjadke", but "imet~ja v ras-porja~enii").4.5 The surface behaviour of negat ion isnot the same in Czech and Jn Russian: inCzech, even partial negation is often expres-sed as a prefix of the verb, which gives riseto an ambiguity absent in Russian, where %hlsdist inct ion is always transparent.
Some ofthe examples from our texts are:ao Czech:To ant system p~esn~ nev~.Russian:~togo da~e sistema to,no ne znaet.
(Th~s even the system does not know exactly?)b.
Czech:Tabu lka  nen~ u lo~cna na pevn6m m~st~ vpam6ti.Russian:Tahl ica pome~aets ja  ne na postojannom mestev pamjati.
(The matrix is not placed in a fixed posit ionin the stbrage.
)4.6 We assume that the surface order issubstant ial ly the same in the two languages;the dif ferences concern only such specificcases as, e.g., the positions of parts of thecomplex verb forms or those of certain pro~-nouns and particles which have the characterof el it ics in Czech, but usual ly fol low theverb in Russian:a .
Czech:... vypadal by tak, ~e ~ tabulka obsahovalafldaje ...Russian:... vygl jadel by tak, 5to tabl ica soder{ala~Z dannye ...(... he would look as if the matrix con--tained(eond.)
data ...)b. Czech:Budeme se v opera~n~ch syst6mech sna~it ...Russian:V operacionnych sistemach budem s~aratsb/a~,' ' ' ..
.
(In the operating systeme~ we shall try ...)The dif ferences described in this section donot concern the structural order, and thereis no danger that ambiguity might arise.
Thedis location of function words and particlescan be described by general rules.4.7 In 4.1 through 4.6 we wanted to showwhat the problems of parsing are if the cor~respondences in the underlying structure, insurface syntax and in the surface order ofmorphemes are to be made use of, while thedif ferences are solved; we also wanted to il~lustrate the narrowed, but nonetheless neces--sary role of transfer.5.
We wanted to point out that, on the onehand, the closeness of the two languagesmakes it relat ively easy to find a strategyfor an MT system, since the most complex pro-blems of ambiguit ies might be part ia l ly a-voided, although, on the other hand, compara-tive empirical research in the domains oflexicon and of syntax is necessary also forsuch a pair of languages.
Results of such anapproach may be useful in MT, and also in thecontext of a contrastive comparison of cog-nate languages.References:Kirschner Z.: On a Device in Dict ionaryOperal ions in Machine Translat ion,in proceedings of Col ing "82, PraguePanevovA J.: Formy a funkce ve stavb~ ~esk8v~ty, Academia,  Prague, 198048
