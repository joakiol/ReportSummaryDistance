A Method of Utilizing Domain and Language specificConstraints in Dialogue TranslationMasami SUZUKIATR Interpreting Telephony Research Laboratories2-2 Hikaridai, Seika-cho, Soraku-gun, Kyoto 619-02 JAPANsuzuki@at r-la.at r.co.j pAbst rac tOne of the characteristics of dialogue translation isthat it is strongly dependent on the situation or thecommunicative goal where the utterance is spoken.Moreover, the distance between the language pairis great, the possibilities of the transfer diverse andit would be difficult to guarantee the equivalence oftranslation.In this article, we propose a method of utilizing do-main and language specific constraints from the view~point of transfer phase in a dialogue translation sys-tem.
q~ansfer processing sometimes requires variouskinds of information: e.g., domain knowledge for el-lipsis resolution, language dependent communicativestructures(focus, theme, rheme, ...).Our standpoint is that there are certain languagespecific strategies on producing utterances in commu-nication.
As steps towards clarifying those stratcgies,we first discuss tim issue of typical idiosyncratic gapsbetween two language pairs.
Next, to resolve suchproblems we suggest a new framework of incorporat-ing domain and language specific knowledge a.s trans-fer rides for dialogue translation from the viewpointof transfer phase.
Finally we will mention related is-sues and further investigation.1 In t roduct ionThe difficulty of translating spoken dialogues betweentwo languages i often greater than that of translat-ing written text.
This is because translation of certainexpressions in a source language are affected by pre-vious context or couununicative goals tinder conllnonknowledge for dialogue participauts.
If the two lan-guages are quite different from each other, possibleexpression candidates increase.
This further compli-cates tile problems of producing utterances in dia-logue translation.In the author's recent work\[12\], tbe factors whichaffect lexical choices aud setting the default transla-tion considering those factors were discussed for se-lecting appropriate verbs.
Of course the selection ofan appropriate verb in given situations is only a smallpart of the great theme of translation i  various levelsof expressiou: e.g., selection of modality corresponding to illocutionary forces, correct choice of articles,etc.
The problem, however, includes important as-pects of linguistic phenomena related to other levels.In that article, some examples of relationships be-tween Japanese and English verbs were investigatedusing a dialogue corpus translated by human inter-preters.
Through comparing corresponding verbs inJapanese and English, some tendencies were envis-aged concerning the characteristics specific to dia-logue translation.Ill another work\[13/, we discussed the issue of trans-lating dialogue utterances through a partitioned se-mantic network, part of which is actually lexicalized.A method was proposed for managing the semanticnetwork, i.e.
re-partitioning of the network, whichyields a more natural translation of utterances.
Weassumed three kinds of partitions: theme vs. theme,old vs. new information, and fore- vs. back-ground.The prodncing of target utterances starts with pro-ceasing along the lines suggested by the source lan-guage, and then the given partition can be reparti-tioned according to properties of the target language.Along this examination, we started to describe ac-tual transfer ules for certain kinds of Japanese ut-terance that seem to be ditficult to translate directlyinto Euglish, because of lacking substantial words inJapanese.
This is the background and the motivationof the current study.Our presuppositions are as follows.?
The  ana lys is  of input  u t terances  are  l im-i ted in the source  language.Basically, dctinite/indetinite or plural/singularmarkers are not indicated in Japanese xplicitly.Moreover, various kinds of arbitrary/obl igatoryellipses of subjects/objects/predicates (occasion-ally) are difficult to resolve within sentential in-tormation.?
A t rans lbr  p rocess ing  is per fomned be-tween lal~guage dependent  feature  s t ruc-t l lres.The analysis module outputs a. feature struc-tnre, which indicates the relationships betweenpredicates and their complements and other in-formation including some pragmatic features.See tile examllles in the next page.AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOt\]T 1992 7 $ 6 PROC.
OF COLING-92, NANTEs, AUG. 23-28, 19922 Idiosyncratic Gaps betweentwo Languages2.1 The Prob lemFor instance, in Japanese a verb may have certainnumber of complements (or the verb has its own valency).
Those complements are often eliminated ifthey are already known as old information.
Whenhonorific expressions (respective, condescend, polite)are used, a certain kind of the ellipses (zero-pronounsreferring the speaker or the hearer) can be resolvedby using these key expressions in many cases.
\[I\]However, there are another sort of utterances whichlack substantial words and are difficult to understandindividually.
As a target of our examinations, we se-lected an expression called "dr-expression".
Thoughthere are a lot of variations for da-expressions\[14\],we consider one of their types that has a structure: Copula(A, B).
It means that A and B is identi-cal (in a certain sense).
In many cases, we cannottranslate such a dr-expression without knowing thecontext where the utterance is spoken.Our current arget domain for dialogue translationis "conference registration task".

Accordingly a certain way ofeomplementation is required.
There can be severalalternatives and it might be difficult to choosc oneappropriate xpression among them.
For instance,J2 could be translated in various ways if such a eom-p\]ementation is performed.E2a: The payment should be made by bank-transfer.E2b: Please pay by bank-transfer.E2e: Would you please pay by bank-transfer?\[agen !X73\[obje !X6\[\[parm !X4\[\]\]\[restr \[\[reln SANKARYOU-a\]\[entity !X4\] \] \ ] \ ] \ ]\[mann !X9\]\]\]\]333\]\]FS-J1.

OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992There are some Japanese expressions (typically"da-expreasions") which lack a substantial word(s)known for tile dialogue participants.
In the previ-ous example sentence J2, the substantial words are :sankaryou(fee) and ginkou-furikomi(bank-transfer).The word sankaryou is the Theme 2 of this utteranceand it is already known (old information) in theprevious utterance.
And the word "shiharau" doesnot appear in J2, while it appeared in J1 .
.12 is atypical da-expression (a kind of copula sentence) inJapanesefl\[14\]The Rheme 2 of the sentence J2 is obviously ginkou-furlkoml (bank-transfer) and it meets the focus ofthe previous question J1.
Accordingly the utteranceJ2 satisfies the Grice's maxim of informativity.
InEnglish, however, we can't say "The fee is hank-transfer."
Wc have to elaborate the utterance withsome substantial or functional words.Generally such kinds of knowledge for elaborationhave been provided with domain knowledge which arecommonly accessed by respective processing modules.We propose that the concept of Mel'~uk's lcxieal func-tions can be extended for designing special sets ofdomain-dependent lexieal functions.
This idea is asfollows.2 .2 How to  e laborate  an  e l l ip t i ca l  sen-tence?1,br introducing our methodology, we use the following predicate-complements no ation (hereafter PS).\[\[Pred Predicate-symbol\]\[Case-labell Complement i\]\[Cas e-label2 Complement2\]\[Case-label3 Complement3\]?

corresponding to J2If we transfer it into English, we have to modifytile structure using definite semantic relationships.\[\[Prod PAY\]\[Agen \[\] \]\[Obj e FEE\]\[Mamt BANK_TRANSFER\]\]PS-E2.

lot of vaa'iations of cla expre~qiolm observed inour dialogue corpus.The structure PS-E2 could yield two sentences :The fee  is  paid by bank- t rans fer .You pay the fee by bank-transfer.lIowever, it is still unnatural because the speaker'sintention doesn't appear in these sentences.
There-fore another elaboration is needed for producing amore sophisticated utterance.The previous utterance J 1 is apparently a questionthat demands a value referred with the interrogative"donoyouni" (how).
During our pre-transfer phase,an Illocutionary Force Type ( IFT)  of tile given sen-tence is extracted.t7\] In this case, the IFT of J1 isdetermined ~us QUEST IONREF.So far the assignment of IFTs was decided withmatching surface expressions.
Accordingly tile IFTof J2 is first recognized ms INFOI1.M (default IFT),becanse the predicate DA-identlcal (colmla) does notspecify any explicit intention.\[ lIFT QUESTIONREF\]\[Agen *SPEAKER*\]\[Recp *HEARER*\]\[Ob2e HOW(!X) \[\[Pred PAY\]\[Modal OBLIGATION\]\[Obj e SANKARYOU\]\[Mann !X\]\]\]\]PS-E1.

Wc observe several frequent verbs with specif-ically Ciominant eooccurrenee of nouns.
Thougb thesenouns do not always appear explicitly, we carl as-sume their existence in the background of utterances.l'br example, we can describe preferable candidatesof complements which have strong relationships witha verb "pay" in our target domain, 5 The italic lettersymbols indicate eoneeptnal categories.pay object - (attendance) fee, amoun~ of moneypay agent dialogue pavticipanl(speaker / imarer)pay manner -- bank-transfer, credit card, in cashpay - time-destination - date, deadlineHere we define a set of domain dependent knowl-edge after tim notation of lexical fimctions proposedby Mel'~uk\[8\].Obje(pay) ::?.

Such kiudsof knowledge can be extracted semi-automaticallyfrom our dialogue corpus, to'u certain extent.,3.2 Language spec i f i c  s t ra teg ies  o fp roduc ing  ut terancesIt is natural to consider that there exist eertaiu lan-guage specific strategies of producing ut*erances, il>tuitively fro|n the prevk)us example dialogue, inother words, sonic Iangue*ge dependent co Innn lu ica -tive structures are recognized.
Pragmatic onstraintsare derived from the difference of eommunieatiw~strategies with languages.
So far, this importancehas been relatively less regarded eonlpared with otherlinguistic aspects in trauslation.\[2\]5Thongh we do  llOt ment.

Ilowew~r, the following exam-pies includes some special nuances in their final ex-pressions.
Both of them are quite natural as responsesto the qnestion J 1.J2a: sankaryou wa g inkou- fur ikomito  naZte oriraasu, (polite da-expression)J2b: sankaryou wa ginkou-fur?kom?de onega i  sh imasu.
(polite request)We think that these Japanese utterances are equiv-alent under the given situation (or tile communicativegoal).
In any cases, the method of payment is designated.
The point is how it should bc communicated.We can assume the attitnde of the speaker is keptconsistent in principle.
The translation shonld alsofollow this rule, especially in ca.ue of the utterancesby the secretary of the conference.
It couhl affectthe style of expressions.
In faet, we found many 1N-FORM utternces really mean indirect REQUEST.The indirectness i remarkable in Japanese (usingda-expressious) and a direet translation can be abrut)tor not informative, partly because there seems to beno polite copula expressions in Ellglish.
Therefore, acertain transfer of IFT might be required.We have to consider some constraints for al)plyingsuch a rule.

23-28, 1992Each rewriting rule has its specific application con-straiuts(AC).
When the ACs unify with the RE in acertain phase, the appheation of the rule fires.
Thus,the transfer process is procedurally performed, ac-cording to the REs.
This allows individual rules tobe rather declarative and include few procedural de-cisions for lexical choice.We implemented the rules that contain domain andlanguage specific constraints, extending this RWS.Several example rule are shown below.

Transfer  rule for I FTTA concise description for notation of rewriting(tra~mfer)rules: The first line of a rule indicates the target feature pathof rewriting, followed by Application Constraints with combi-nations of pm'a~neters and their values; e.g.
:Type :GenerahThe patterns in = ... and out = ... indicate the input and theoutput (sub)feature stntcture r~pectively.
Some additionalconditions can be described using if sentences.
For referring afeature value, a feature path i~a tot~to-down direction can beused like as Input.Obje.PredNote that the above mfle~ are partly modified for explanationusing PSs instead of FSs.The explanation for the rules is described as fol-lows, though the allowed space precludes the detail.The whole transfer process are composed of severalsub-procedures according to the Rewriting Environ-meats designated by the main rule (the top level rule).The general framework is as follows.First, the rewriting of ellipsis resolution processprovides the missing zero-pronouns referring thespeaker or the hearer.
Then an Illocutionary ForceType is given to ttle top level of tile feature struc-ture.
After this a kind of normalization is performed(so called Japanese-to-Japanese transfer) in order tomake the (Japanese-to-English) transfer easier.
Theprocessing of these sub-procedures are regarded as apre-transfer phase.The main transfer phase contains 3 sub-procedures: idiomatic, general and default.
The Rule-1 is anexample of simple general transfer ules.After the main transfer phase, the transfer withinthe English feature structures is performed.
TheRule-2 and the Rule-3 are applied in this phase.Using ttle Rule-2, a Copula predicate structure istransferred to another substantial predicate struc-ture.
When this rule is applied, a local parameter isset to the Rewriting Environment.
After this, underthe new RE the transfer of cases (e.g.
lden -~ Mann)is carried out with another ewriting rule includingdomain knowledge.The Rule-3 designates a rewriting of IFT from IN-FORM to REQUEST under certain conditions.
Asmentioned in tile previous section, such a transferyields a more natural utterance.At present he flexibility of the system is still in-sufficient from the viewpoint of context, processing.Iiowever, it is possible to control apllying rules bymeans of local parameter setting (like :status :com-plement), to a certain extent.3 .4  Other  Examples  and  the  cur rents ta tusThe following examples were described as domainand language specific knowledge for translating typ-ical "da-expressions" that appear in our target dc~maim The frequency of "da-expressions" iu ATRDialogue Database is as follows.
This investigation(by Tomokiyo) recognized about 200 different wordsequences as da-expressions in predicate parts of sen-tences in the conference registration dialogues.The occurrence of da-express ions:  1,845The occurrence of a l l  p red icates :  5,200(approximat ely )The numbers of sentences and words appeared thecorpus are respectively 1,666 and 38,258.
The rateof da-expressions is roughly 35 %.
Though tile exactpercentage of copula da-expressions is not yet calcu-lated, it is estimated at 150 ~ 200.
Besides, we envisage some copula expressions which are *tot includedin the above investigation, like "to natte orimasu"(mentioned in the subsection 3.2).
The current askACqES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOUq" 1992 7 6 0 PROC.
OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992is to classify the types of copula expressions which re-quire certain complementation f substantial words.Among them, two typical examples are shown as follows.aa: Tsugi no iinkai wa ikkagetsu go desK.E3: The next committee will be held afterone month.J4: XXX-hotoru wa ZZZZ-yen to natte orimasu.E4: As for XXX-hotel, it(the room charge)costs ZZZZ yen.Both of tire above Japanese sentences lack substan-tial predicates: e.g.
corresponding to "will be held" or"costs".
For translation of 33, an associative knowl-edge(a kind of common sense) is required:committee time location ~ be heldIn this example, J 3 is the answer for the question thatdemands the date of the next committee.
Whether ornot a substantial predicate indicating the event  leadby tire committee and the date(interrogation) appearsin the previous utterances, that kind of associativeknowledge (relatively specific to the target domain)is applicablE.As fbr ,14, an implicit comparison (actually thelocal topic of the dialogue is "the expense of hotelrooms") is underlying.
In this case, the key to com-plemental,on can bE obtained from tile preceding ut-terances.
It implies that the XXX hoteru with topicnmrker "wa" (it seems to be the subject of the sen-tence like aa) only designates the f ie ld of the copulaequation.
In our current h'amework of analysis ofsentence by sentence, it is impossible to distinguishthe difference between J3 and a4.
Thereh)re certaindomain klmwledge is required.
For achieving a suit-able translation, it should be comlected with the lawguage specitic constraint of producing (discourse) ut-terances.

Concerning the issue ofidentifying Japanese zero pronouns, we have someprevious works.
A theoretical foundation was givenby Yosbimoto\[15\] and an implementation was per-formed by Dohsaka\[1\], in which zero pronouns re-ferring dialogue participants (speaker/hearer) areidentified based on tile usage of honor'tics and thespeaker's territory within a sentence.
As such ellipsesoccnr ahnost obligatorily in dialogue, tim formaliza-tion seems to be relatively simple.
Of course, theresolution of some phenomena requires more complexinformation from the context.Kudo\[5\] showed that another kind of ellipsis indi-cating objects in the previous sentence could be r~solved with local cohesive knowledge xtracted fromactual corpora.
This knowledge consists of pmr tern--plate patterns of successive two se.ntences and enablescertain eomplementation f elliptical objects.
Thevalue of iris work is to bave proposed a method ofsenti-automatic acquisition of such knowledge fromreal dialogue corpora.r6\]The primary objectiw~ of these approaches was toresolve ellipses.

23-28, 19924.2 Future DirectionsAccording to Narita\[9\], we can aSsulne two kinds ofsyntactic systems for ally languages.
The first is acore syntactic structurc that is generally recognizedas a universal system of syntax.
Tbe second syntacticstructure is rather language dependent and periph-eral.
Ilowever, this does not mean that tile secondsyntactic system is unimlrortant.
Though it is dif-ficult to translate into other languages, the secondsyntactic system just reflects the characteristics of acertain langnage.
It includes many favorite expres-sions ill the language.
This issue is quite interestingalso froln tile standpoint of soeioliuguistics and crosslanguage omlnunieation.From tile viewpoint of translating dialogues, if anexl)ressi(m of a source language is peril)heral andthere is no corresponding structures in a target language, the source struetoure could be transforlned intoa universal structure before translation.
In orderto perforln this idea, such a transformation shouldbe possible to be formalized.
1,'urtherlnore, certainimplicit (domain- and language-specific) knowledgemight be needed ill sonic cases.Tile target expression in this article, a certain kindof "da-expressions', is regarded as a typical secondsyntactic structure described above.
Our fnture ef-forts will be directed to investigating various struc-tures and for refining and extending the methodologyproposed here.5 Conc lus ionIn order to lirovide a effective method of translatinga kind of copnla sentences lacking some substantialwords, a lnetAlod of utilizing domain and languagespecific constraints are proposed.
