A Part-of-Speech-Based Alignment AlgorithmKuang-hua  Chen and t ls in- I  Isi ChenDepartment  of  Computer  Science and Information Engineer ingNational Ta iwan UniversityTaipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.e-mail: hh chen@csie.ntu.edu.twAbstractTo align bilingual texts becomes a crucial issuerecently.
Rather than using length-based ortranslation-based criterion, a part-of-speech-basedcriterion is proposed.
We postulate that source textsand target exts should share the same concepts, ideas,entities, and events.
Simulated annealing approach isused to implement this aligmnent algorithm.
Thepreliminary experiments how good performance.Most importantly, the experimental objects areChinese-English texts, which are selected fromdifferent language families.1.
I n t roduct ionReal texts provide the alive phenomena, usages, andtendency of langnage in a parlictflar space and time.This recommends us to do the researches on thecorpora.
Recently, many rese~{rchers timber claimthat "two languages art more informative than one"(Dagan, 1991).
They show that two languages coukldisambigna.te each other (Gale e?
al., 1992); bilingualcorpus could form a bilingual dictionary (Brown et al,1988) and terminology correspondence bank (Eijk,1993); a refined bilingual corpus could be formed theexamples for machine translation systems (Sumita etal., 1990).
To do such kinds of researches, the mostimpmlant task is to align the bilingual texts.Many length-based alignment algorithms havebeen proposed (Brown et al, 1991; Gale and Church,1991a).
The correct rates are good.
However, thelanguages they processed belong to occidental family.When these algorithms are applied to other rtmningtexts from different families, will the performancekeep on tile same level?
Other translation-basedalignments (Kay, 199l; Chen, 1993) show thedifficulty in determining the word correspondence andare very complex.In tiffs paper, we will introduce a part-of-speech(POS)-based alignment algorithm.
Section 2 willtouch on the level of alignment and define thesentence terminators.
In Section 3, we will proposetile criterion of critical POSes and investigate thedistribution of these POSes in the Chinese-Englishtexts.
Section ,l will describe a fifir and rigorousmethod for evaluating performance.
Then, we applysimulated annealing technique to conductingexperiments and show tile experimental results inSection 5.
Section 6 will give a brief conclusion.2.
A l ignment  P rob lemAlignment has three levels: 1) paragrapll; 2) sentence;and 3) word.
Paragraph level is sometimes calleddiscourse level.
Many efforts are involved in senlencelevel and fewer researchers louch on the word level(Gale and Clmrch, 1991b).
To do sentence alignment,we should first define what a sentence is.
ILl English,tile sentence terminators are fifll stop, question mark,and exclamation mark.
\[\[owever, tim usage ofpunctuation marks is unrestricted in Chinese and thetypes of punctuation marks are numerous (Yang,1981).
Nevertheless, in order to parallel the languages,we define that tile sentence markers are fldl slop,question mark, and exclamation mark over alllanguages.
Therelbre, an alignment of two texts is tofind a best sequence of sentcnce groups, which arcended with one of tile sentence t rnlillalors.Following Brown el al.
(1991), we use tile termbead.
A bead contains ome sentences of source andlargct texls.
Thus, alignment can be defined as (1).
(I) An alignment is to find a bead sequence undersome crileria.If Ihe applied criteria are significant, he performancewill be good.
Finding significant criteria is tile core ofthis research.3.
Criteria of Al ignmentALLy aligmnenl algorilhm has its own criteria.
Forexample, many alignment algorithms are based onsentence lengfl~ and word correspondence.
Here, wcpropose aPOSes-based crilerion.
(2) Alignment Crilerion:"File numbers of critical part of speeches (POSes)of a langt,age pair in an aligned bcad are close.166Now, the problem ix what forms the critical POSes.Following many gr~,mmar formalisms (Sells, 1985),the content words will be the good indicalors.Therefore, we think nouns, verbs, and adjectives as thecritical POSes.
In addition, we inch,de mm~bers andquotation marks in the critical POSts due to intuition.The English tagging system used in this work followsthat of the LOB Corpus (Johansson, 1986).
TheChinese tagging system follows that of the BDCCorpus (BDC, 1992) but with some modilications.The BI)C COrlms docs not assign tags to Imnctualionmarks.
We adopl Ihe same philosophy of I,OB Corpusto assign the tags of the punctuation marks asthemselves.
These critical POSes in English and inChinese arc listed in Table 1.

On the onehand, the POSes may be changed within an alignment;on the other hand, a sequence of English words maycorrespond to a Chinese word.
These phenomenamake the alignment much harder.
HowEver, Table 2shows that these POSes are good indicators foralignment.4.
How to Eva luate  the Per formanceBefore proceeding the experiment, another importantissue is how to ewfluate the correct rate for analignment.
No literatures tonch on this issue.
We justfind in literatures what performance is rather than howto evaluate it.
Note that aligmnent has the orderconstraint.
On the OnE hand, when an error occurs,the performance should drop quickly.
On the otherband, the error will not broadcast to the nextparagraph.
That is to say, the error will be limitcd in arange.
Our criterion for evaluating performance takescare of the two factors.For a given text, we could manually find the realalignment.
This alignment consists of a sequence ofbeads, as mentioned previously.
We call the sequenceof beads Real Bead Sequence (RI?S).
In contrast, wemay apply any alignment algorithm to finding analignment.
We call this aligmnent Contputed HeadSequence (CIL'?
).Ill order to evahlate the perforlnancc of tilealignment algoritlun, WE filrthcr define thelncrentental Bead A'eqHence (II}S).
(3) hTcremental Bead Sequence 1BS of a givenbead sequencc BS is a bead scquence, suchthat \[lead \]fli in IBN is snmmation of 15(0 _<.
j .<_ i - 1) in IJS.Therefore, two possible II3Ses, 1RBS and /C\]IS, aregenerated under this consideration.
We defineperformance for an alignment as(4) Performance =nutnber of common beads in IRI3S and ICBSnumber of beads in IRBSTable 3 demonstrates how to calculate lhcperformancE.
Two beads, (3,3) and (10,10), areshared by II?BS and ICI}S. The total numllcr of beadsin IReS is 10.
Therefore, the performance is 20%.
Inthe following experiment, we will use this method toevahmte performance.Tahle 3.

A l ignment  Algor i thmThe alignment algorithms proposed in the pastliteratures try to find an optimal alignment which Iresthe largest alignment probability.
Due to llle verylarge search space, they all consider only five types ofbeads: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,11, and (1,0).
Afterexamining our corpus, we can find other types ofbeads such as (1,3) and (1,4).
Furthermorc, bcad type(2,4) is also found.
Table 4 lists tile distribution ofbead types in the testing lexts.
Eiphl bead types appearin tile bilingual texls.
Bead type ( l , l )  is the majority(63.9%).
Bead types (1,31, 0,4), and (2,4), which :irenot treated in other papers, occupy 8.2%.
If thealignment algorithm did not dcal with these bead types,the correct rate would be bound to 91.8%.Tahle 4.

5.63 2.25 0.28 l{}O168It shows tile difficulty of tile alignment ask.
If weallow various types of beads and adopt the optimalsearch, tile processing cost is too high to stand.
Agood algorithm should satisfy tile following twoconditions:It is a general local search algorithm.It allows the unlinfited bead types in thealigning process.Under this consideration, simulated annealingapproach (Aarts and Korst, 1989) is used to align texts.The idea of annealing comes from condensed matte,"physics.
It involves two steps: 1) increasingtemperature of matter; 2) decreasing temperaturegradually until the matter in the ground configuration.Simulated annealing is to sinudate the almealingprocess.
Therefore, a simnlated annealing mechanistnis composed of four parts: configuration, (ransitionfimction, energy fimction, and annealing schedule.
Ifwe take an alignment as a configuration, the possiblealignmenls constitute tile configuration space.
Inaddition, every configuration is associated with anenergy.
The optimal configuration is tile one whichhas tile lowest energy.
Simulated annealing is to findtile optimal configuratio,i from an initial configurationby generating a sequence of configurations under acontrol parameter.For our application, we introduce anothercomponent, Transition Vector.
The five componentsare defined as follows.
(5) Configuration (C): An alignment is aconfiguration naturally.
For example, apossible bead sequence, {(1,21, (I,1), (1,1),(1,2), (1,1)}, is a configuration.
(6) 7)'ansition l,'unction (T): Given aconfiguration, this fimction is responsible forgenerating its next configuration.
Atransition vector is generated ill random, alldthen tile transition ftmction moves oneconfiguration to another configurationaccording to the transition vector.
(7) 7}'ansition I/ector (TV): A transition vectorconsists of 4 components (H, N, IV, D).B denotes the identification (counted from 01of a selected bead.N specifies whether to generate a new beador not.
I fN  equals to 0, no new bead ixgenerated.
If N equals to 1, a new bead isgenerated.IV represents which language ill tile selectedbcad should be moved ont.
If W equals to 0,one of the marginal sentences of tile firstlanguage should bc moved out.
Otherwise,one of tile marginal sentences of the secondlanguage should be moved out.I) represents he moving direction.
0 denotesthe left marginal sentence of the selectedbead is moved left, and 1 denotes the rightmarginal sentcnce of the selected bead ismoved right.For example, transition fimclion will transita configuralion {(1,2), (1,1), (1,1), (1,21,(1,1)} to {(1,2), ( l , l ) ,  tO, l), (1,0), (1,2),(1,1)) according to tile transition vector TV- (2 ,  1,(1, l).
(s) lOwrev I,)mclion (E): Assume each sentencehas a weight, which is measured by tilenmnber of critical POSes.
The weightdifference of a bead is the difference betweenthe weighls of respective sentences in onebead.
The energy of a configuration is thesum of weight differences of all beads in aconfiguration.
(9) Annealing Sclwdule (AS): When a newconti~,uu'ation (" is generated, twoalternatives are considered: move to the newconfiguration C' or retain tile currentconfiguration C'.

This is the well-known Metropolis('rileri(m. The CPk is Ihc control parameter,which will be reduced gradually in tilea,mealing process.Now, we apply tile simulated annealing to aligningthe texts, CE 01 to CE 10.
Tile initial controlparameter cpk is 1.0 and initial nm length L k is I000.Wc reduce the control parameter with 0.5% after eachrim.
Tile initial configuration is randomly generated.Wc conduct two cxpcriments, 1) without usingparagraph markers; 2) with using paragraph markers.

Comparison of Aligmnent PErformanceThe correct rates without and with using paragraphmarkers are 78.9% and 94.4%, respectively.
Thelatter result (94.4%) is better than the botmd eorreclrate (91.8%) mentioned before.
It shows that thosedifficult bead types are resolved in our approach.Comparing Tables 5 and 6, we conclude Ihat when theparagraph markers are used, the performanceincreases significantly.
Fig.
1 shows the significanceof paragraph markers.
In other words, if an alignmenlalgorithm could use any reliable anchor points in IhEtexts, the performance will incrEasE sharply.In fact, the pErlbrmancc of alignmcnt is depcndenlon the naturc of the texts.
When aligning a noisy textswithout rcliablc anchor points, we will definitely do abad job.
However, the simulated annealing approachcould reduce the risk, and the performance will keepover 78% in our experiment.6.
Conc lus ionA new criterion to aligning texts is proposed in thispaper.
The criterion is based on an observation thatthe source texts and thc target texts should share thesame concepts, entities, ideas, and events.
Sentencelength (no matter word-based or character-based)(Brown, el al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991a), is notso critical on languages across different languagefamilies.
Translation-based crilcrion (Kay, 1991;ChErt, 1993) is very.
uscfifl, but il is also very complex.Surely, to decide word correspondences is difficull.Our criterion provides a tradcoff between the length-based criterion and the translation-based criterion.The elucs of critical POSes are parlially syntactic andpartially statislic~d.ThE performance of simulated annealing approachto alignment is 94% in our Experiment, if we use theparagraph markers.
Without paragraph marker, thevalue drops lo 78%.
GEnerally speaking, it works wellfor languages across different language families.The main conlribntion of lhis work is to provide analignment algorithm for aligning oriental langvageswith occidental languages.
The fitture work shouldfocus on the large experiment, normalizing the weightof critical POSes and other search techniques.170AcknowledgementsResearch on this paper was partially supported byNational Science Council grant NSCg,l-(}40g-l~002-005.ReferencesAarts, E. and J. Korst (1989).
