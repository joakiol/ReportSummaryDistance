of Linguistics, University of Lnnd,Helgonabacken 12, S+223 62 LUND, SwedenSUMMARY:The paper presents aprocedure for interpre-tation of English compounds and lkn" automatictranslation of such compounds into Slaviclanguages and French.
In tile target languages,a compound nominal is as a role to be renderedby an NP with an adjective or genitive attri-bute, or with an attrilmtive participle construc-tion.
The model is based on Bierwisch's theoryof word formation, which in turn is inspired bycategorial grammar.
The procedure is appliedto a specific domain (asthma research).0.
INTItOI)UCTIONThe need of a component interpretingcomplex lexical items in an MT systemtranslating fl'om Germanic languages into e.g.French or Slavic languages is obvious.
Manyrules (or patterns) of word fo,'mation are highlyproductive, which makes it impossible to storeall complex lexical entries in a static lexicon.An effective MT system rnust also be able tomatch the interpretation f a complex entry withthe correct morphosyntactic pattern in the targetlanguage.
For example, a program translatingfrom German into Polish must distinguish therelations between the parts of a compound likeUniversitiitslehrer (university teacher) \['rotll therelations holding between Musik and Lehrer inMusiklehrer (teacher el + music).
The first men-tioned compound is to be translated as a nounfollowed by an adjective (nattczyciel tmiwersy-tecki-'teacher university+adjective ending'), thelater one its a noun and a genitive attribute (,za-ttczyciel mttzyki-'teacher music+gen').
Similarproblems occur when translating into French orCzech: cf.
Musikabend-Fr.
soim;e mtt.s'icah' (na), Cz.
hudebn( ve&~r (a n), Mttsiklehrer-Fr.pro.fiesseur de musique (n prep n), Cz.
tlEitelhudbv (n n+gen).Tile models for compound interpretation a dgeneration proposed by general inguists (of.Lees 1960, Selkirk 1982, Fanselow 1988,Bierwisch 1989) require as a rule several modi-fications in order to be applicable ill an MTsystem.
Since, in our opinion, a model aimedto serve as an efficient tool for NLP and MTmnst be linguistically valid, we will discuss anumber of theoretical questions and relate ourmodel to general inguistics beRn'e presentingour experimental procedure t'or domain-restricted compound translation.1.
Till,; STATUS OF WORI) FORMATIONRUIA,;S1.1.
'Where 's  nmrpho logy?
'The above question, put by StephenAnderson 1982, is still waiting for a definitiveanswer.
Word for,nation rules have beenclaimed to obey syntactic principles and hencebeing a part of UG (Lees 1960, Pesetsky1985), to form a grammatical level on their own(Di Sciullo & Williams 1987), to be explainablein semantic terms solely (Fanselow 1988) or tobelong to the lexicon (Chomsky 1970, Jacken-doff 1975, Bierwisch 1989).We will propose a quite simple answer toAnderson's question: morphology shall be seen;is a component of the grammar, tim notion'grammar' to be understood as an integratedfnodel where no borders are drawn betweensyntax, morphology, and semantics.1.2.
Towards an integrat ion of syntax,semantics and morphologyFanselow (1985, 1988)argues, on tile basisof psycholinguistic evidence, for treating wordfornmtion rules not ;is generative processes, butas a 'primitive' process of co,acatcnating mor-phematic items, a very easily learnable proce-dure.
His argumentation is restricted to morph-ology in the traditional sense of tim term.
Wewould like to go even further and clailn that tilegralnmal" as a whole can be regarded as a set ofpat terns  {'of concalolVdtion or COOCllITellCe oflexical items, each concatenatio,~ pattern asso-ciated with principles of semantic interpretation.This approach is to some extent inspired by (butfar l'ronl identical to) categorial grammar andgierwisch's lexicon theory (P, ierwisch 1989).At tile same time, it is in its very essence notincompatible with Constraint Grannnar (Karls-son 1990, Koskenniemi 1990).1.3.
Compounds as col locationsEnglish compounds provide an argument in\['avour of our approach to grammar.
It seemsimpossible to draw a clear-cut borderlinebetween strings traditionally labelled its4,5compounds and those classified as nounphrases.
Cf.
:the following examples, takenfrom a corpus of medical abstracks:ragweed allergic dffnitishouse-thtst-allergic a,vthmahouse chtst asthmapatient daily symptom diary cardsfluticasone propionate aqueous nasal sprayIn most grammatical descriptions, stringsconsisting of nouns (like house dust asthma)are treated as compound nouns, whereas acomplex including an adjective followed by a'noun is normally labelled as an NP.
The aboveexamples show, however, that such adistinction is not unproblcmatic.
Phrases likehouse-dust-allergic asthma and.fluticasonepropionate aqueous nasal spray may beanalysed either as NPs containing a compoundadjective and a head noun, or as compoundsincluding optional adjective constituents (hottsedust asthma nd fluticasone ,wray are perfectlywell-formed).
Furthermore, parts of an Englishcompound may provide referents for ellipticconstructions, asin the following examples:The variations in provocation concentrations ...were small during both placebo aml activedrug treatmentthe d~fference between a single al lergenprovocation and continltotts exposure...Thus, a noun included in a compound can stillhave a referent on its own, an ability normallyassociated with nominal phrases.
Such facts in-dicate that there is no absolute distinction to bedrawn between compound nominals and com-plex nominal phrases in English.
It seems moreappropriate otalk about morn or less lexicalizedcollocations.
However, in the following the tra-ditional term 'compound' will be used.2.
AUTOMATIC INTIqlPilETATION ANDTRANSLATION OF COMPOUNi)S2.1.
The theoretical foundationBierwisch (1989; cf also Olsen 1991)regards the process of compounding as afunctional application, where one of thethematic roles of the head noun becomes'absorbed'.
For example, a noun like payer issupposed to have the following interp,'etation:)~y)~x\[zINST\[xPAYy\]\],where y is the external theta-role, x the internalone, mad z represents he 'referential role'.
In acompound like bill payer, the internal role ofpay becomes instantiated:)vx\[zINST\[xPAY BILL\]\].Our analysis of compounds is notincompatible with Bierwisch's approach.However,  for the purpose of MT, aclassification of valency in terms of three kindsof theta roles only (external, internal andreferential) seems insufficient.
A procedure forcompound interpretation must also take intoaccount optional thematic roles, e.g.
location(tmive~wio, teacher).
It must in addition be ableto deal with compounds that do not includedeverbal components.
IIence, we decided tomodify the theory proposed by Bierwisch attwo main points:a. the valency of a verbal stem is to be repre-sented not in terms of external and internal themroles, but in terms of the components of theevent or situation the verb may refer tob.
the interpretation of compounds that do notcontain deverbal elements is based on morpho-semantic patterns pecifying the default read-ings of combinations that include members ofdilTferent semantic ategories.2.2 An experimental  procedure forunderstanding derived nouns andcompoundsIn an experimental program, implemented inLPA MacProlog, we structured a very restrictedlexicon of Swedish stems and affixes (basallexical ent,'ies, BI.A) according to the approachoutlined above.
Each verbal stem was providedwith a list of elements of its typical event refer-ent, e.g.
:lex(\[ l~ir\],m(teach,stem),v,vt,\[ agent,sem_object,domain,place,time,resultl,\[\]).Affixes were specified with respect o the fol-lowing features:0 the category or categories of stems the affixmay be combined with0 the resulting category, including the morpho-syntactic specification0 the default semantic interpretation f the affix.For example, the Swedish agcntive suffix -arewas represented as:slex(\[ arel,su ff(n,agr(sg,re,inde f)),v,agent,\[\]).Underived nouns got a quite simplified seman-tic specifcation formulated in tradilional termslike 'human', 'animate', 'abstract', concrete','potential location' etc.
On this basis, the inter-prctation procedure tried to match the semanticspecification of the affix or of the noun andassociate the morphcmaiic entries attached to theverb stem with the most probable lements of46the stem's semantic valency.
The program dis-tinguished correctly between coml+ounds likegrammatikliimre (teacher of gl'itllllllal') and toli-vetwitetslih'are (university teacher), as shown inthe following outprint.
:- analym(\[grammatikl;,iraml)m(Idomain(grammar),head (m (I agen t(su ff),head(teach) l) l)category: n agr(sg, re, indel +)constituents \[grammatik, 1;,irate, \[\]fir, :tre tl:- analyse(\[universitetsl;,irarel)m(\[ place(university),head(m(\[agent(suff),head(teach)\]))l)category: n agr(sg, re, indef)constituents \[universitet, l?irare, I I~ir, atollThe program wits also able to interpretsomewhat unusual, but I'ully possil+lecompounds like ttniversitervmi)rdare (universitykiller).
In the case of 'university killer', threealternative interpretations were given, all ofthem acceptable in Swedish: l) a person whokills in university buildings, 2) somebody whocauses destruction of a university, 3) somehodywho uses a university for destructive purposes.The flexibility of the quite simple interpretationprocedure and its ahility to 'undcrst:md' evenunusual complex words encouraged us to applythe method tested by means ol7 the toy programfflr a more serious goal, viz.
for interpretationand translation of rncdical abstracts dealing withasthma nd allergy research.2.3.

Domain-re lated requ i rementsIn order to construct a domain specificlexicon and to design apl)ropriate parsing andtranslation algorithms, we investigated a corpusof about 140 medical abstracts.
Already thepreliminary inspecticm provided evidence forthe need of a special procedure for COmlmundinterpretation.
The frequency of compounds inthe texts was extremely high.
Cf.
the followingsample:A large-scale mttlticenter investigationwas undertaken in 3 cities with c'Oml)aral.~lepollen seasons and atmospheric pol lenconcentrat ions in order to obtain+ moredell'nile it~flormatiot7 about the sa/'ety and+q\[icacy o\['cromolyn sodium in the treatmentof pollen-induced seasonal rhinitis.Complex names of chemical substances, ascromolyt~ soditm,, do not pose especially greatprohlems to an MT system, since chemicalsymbols may be efficiently used as interlingualrepresentations.
Highly lexicalized and highlyidiosyncratic ompoutv, ls, like airways or hayfi, ver, may also he stored in tim basic lexicon.The rnain difficulty lies rather in the translationof productive compounds referring to differentallergic syudroms, types of medical treatmentand patient groups (ragweed pollen asthma,late-stmtmer rhinilis, Jhmisolide test,.lhmisolMepatient group etc.).
In different exts, tile samesyndrom may be referred to by differentphrases, e.g.
ragweed asthma, ragwood-in-dttced asthnla, ra,~wood pollen asttuna, rag-wood-allergic asthma etc.
A correct interpreta-tion of the semantic relations between tile con-stituents of such collocations is necessary forcorrect translation.
Otherwise, a phrase likechild/~ood o.vthma \vcmhl be translated intoFrench itot its asthme des etfrmts, bttt as ?tsthmeinchtit par el!/?race (lit.
asthma induced by child-hood-by analogy to e.g.
pyrethrltm asthma-ctslhme induit \]mr \]~yr+;thrines).
A procedure forinterpretation of compounds and complex NPsmust therefore include a kind ol' domain know+lc?lge, preferably encoded in the lexicon.2.3.2.
The lexiconAn MT system aimed at translatkm ofscientific texts should give tile user a possibilityel" adding new entries to the lexicon in a simpleway.
A system for medical abstract translationwould n{~t be really useful, if the user could notintroduce names of new medicines, new termsdenoting syndroms, symptoms, treatment me-.thods etc.
Since the users of such a .systemwould, with a high degree of probability, be anon-linguist, the linguist designing the methodfor lexicon extension lntlst adapt the form ofinteractions to the expected competence of theI .
iser.It would be naive to helive that a non-linguistcould manage to specify tile lexical items interms of internal and external theta~roles.
Eventerms like agent, theme and semantic objectwould prohably cause confusion, l-lence, itseems most reasonable to fornmlate the se,nan-tic classification i  do,nain-spccific texts (in ourcase, in terms like allergen, syndrom, body-partetc.).
There are actually linguistic reasons forthis solutiotl, as scientific sublanguages differsemantically from each other as well as from theeveryday conversation language.
For a botanist,pyrethrum is primarily +a plant belonging to thechrysanthemum family, whereas an allergy re-47searcher regards pyrethrum as an allergy-induc-ing factor, having much in common with grasspollen and house dust.In the preliminary model of the lexicon deve-loped until now we classify nouns as membersof the following categories:- syndrom (as thma,  rhinitis)- symptom (sneezing, irritation)- allergen (pyrethrum, ragweed)- body  part (airways, skin)- body function (inhalation)- chemical substance:medic ine  (ant ih i s tamine)  ornot  used  as  med ic ine  (h i s tamine)- medical treatment (injection)- scientific method (measurement, test)- time period (season, childhood)- lmman: patient or not (the later distinction isneeded for con'ect interpretation f e.g.asthma patient and asthma researcher)- amount: mass or countable (dose, group)- others: concrete or abstract2.3 .3 .
In teract ive  lex icon  extensionTim user has tim possibility to classify newnouns to be added to the lexicon by marking thedesired alternative in an interaction window.The same entry may be marked as belonging toseveral categories.
For example, inhalation maybe regarded as both body function and medicaltreatment (house dust inhalation~steroid inha-lation).
When adding a compound, the user isasked to specify its constituents according to thecategory list above.
New words may be typedin by the user or read in fl'om a text file.It is assumed that the lexical entries to beadded will belong to open lexical classes:nouns, verbs and adjectives.
To distinguishbetween these three classes is not an impossibletask for a non-linguist, especially if anappropriate instruction is provided.
Adjectivesare classified in a way similar to nouns, e.g.nasal, bronchial-denoting body part; stttf\[iv,rttnny (as in sttt\[\[iy nose)-dcnoting symptomand attribute of body part.A user-adapted classification of ve,'bs ismore difficult to achieve.
In our preliminarymodel, tim user is presented questionscombined with example patterns, for instance:'Does tim verb take an object, like investigatethe effects'?'
Does it also take a complementwith a certain preposition like: shield the patientfrom house dust?'
'What preposition isrequired?'
If the verb in question turns out to betransitive, a further question is asked about hesemantic category of the typical object,according to the standard category list.
Thespecification of verbs takes more time than theone of nouns and adjectives.
However, theneed of introducing new verbs is ~su:dly not asgreat as the need o17 adding new nouns.2.3.4.
Compound interpretat ion andgenerat ion  o f  ta rget  equivalentsThe present program covers the mostfrequent types of compounds found in thecorpus.
After having filtered out the most fl'e-quent verbs (:mxiliaries, medals) and items be-longing to closed lexical classes (pronouns, art-icles, prepositions etc.
), we first investigatedword frequencies, and then the (unfiltered)environment of about the thirty most frequentwords.
On this basis, we could state that themost usual compounds containing the mostfrequent nouns (disregarding names of chemicalsubstances) display the following patterns:i.
(attribute, concretc)-allergcn-(adj)-synd,'omhouse dust (allergic) asthma(grass) pollen (seasonal) asthmaii.

The decision has to be made by theuser.Translation of frequent compounds of thetype noun+past participle (allergen-shielded,allergen-tested, placebo controlled) is handledin a way similar to the one used in the prototypeprogram when translating compounds like uni-versity teacher and univetwity killer.
The seman-tic category of the noun is compared with the~mantic specification of the wdency of the verbstem and the noun is associated with the mostprobable verbal argument.
Thus, allergenshielded tvom is interpreted as 'a rooin shieldedfi'om allergen', while allergen tested skin getsthe reading 'skin tested by exposure to aller-gen'.3.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMP I .

Remaining problemsThe method proposed here has so far led togood translation results.
However, the problemlies not only in interpreting a COlnp(mnd, butalso in identifying an English word sequence itsa compound.
For the time heing, we use a pars-ins procedure based on a combination of depen-dency grammar and categorial grammar.
Themain parsing difficulty, when dealing with anEnglish input, is to decide whether a lexicalstem functions as a finite predicate or as a noini-nal.
We try to remove the ambiguity by startingthe parsing by a procedure called 'verbfinder',searching for possible candidates for the predi-cate function.
The function o1" ambiguous items,like result, control etc., may often be identifiedon tim basis of their evironmeut: if tile word inquestion is immediately preceded by a preposi-tion and/or an article, it can be easily identifiedas a nominal element.
The parsing proceduremay still be made more efficient by utilizing re-stilts of statistic investigations of tile corpus(Steier & Below 1991, Johansson 1993).3.2.
Future plansTim advantage of the model outlined herelies in the fact that the general approacll to thegrammar underlying the translation system maybe adapted to differei~t domains withoutviolating any theoretical assumptions, tlow-ever, the theory solely does not guarantee ahigh-quality translation.
The preliminary sys-tem outlined above is to be developed and im-proved along the following lines:0 statistical methods will be used in order toreduce ambiguities and to discover coocurrencepatterns on tile basis of larger corpora0 the medical vocabuhu'y will be enlarged byusing hirge compui,'ltional medical data-bases(e.g.
MEDLINE) and by consnlting specialistswho are native speakers o1" the languages in-volved in the system0 the interactive procedures will be evaluatedl.lud refined by testing their tiselTuh~ess in expe-riments with non-linguists.The results of the corpus investigations andthe experiments with translation of abstracts amto be used in a system for automatic abstractingand multilingual bstract generation.REI,'I:A~I,~N CI,~S:Anderson, S. 1982.
