We present a method of chunking in Korean texts using conditionalrandom fields (CRFs), a recently introduced probabilistic model for labelingand segmenting sequence of data.
In agglutinative languages such as Koreanand Japanese, a rule-based chunking method is predominantly used for its sim-plicity and efficiency.
A hybrid of a rule-based and machine learning methodwas also proposed to handle exceptional cases of the rules.
In this paper, wepresent how CRFs can be applied to the task of chunking in Korean texts.
Ex-periments using the STEP 2000 dataset show that the proposed method signifi-cantly improves the performance as well as outperforms previous systems.1   IntroductionText chunking is a process to identify non-recursive cores of various phrase typeswithout conducting deep parsing of text [3].
Abney first proposed it as an intermedi-ate step toward full parsing [1].
Since Ramshaw and Marcus approached NP chunkingusing a machine learning method, many researchers have used various machine learn-ing techniques [2,4,5,6,10,11,13,14].
The chunking task was extended to the CoNLL-2000 shared task with standard datasets and evaluation metrics, which is now a stan-dard evaluation task for text chunking [3].Most previous works with relatively high performance in English used machinelearning methods for chunking [4,13].
Machine learning methods are mainly dividedinto the generative approach and conditional approach.
The generative approach relieson generative probabilistic models that assign a joint probability p(X,Y) of pairedinput sequence and label sequence, X and Y respectively.
It provides straightforwardunderstanding of underlying distribution.
However, this approach is intractable inmost domains without strong independence assumptions that each input element isindependent from the other elements in input sequence, and is also difficult to usemultiple interacting features and long-range dependencies between input elements.The conditional approach views the chunking task as a sequence of classificationproblems, and defines a conditional probability p(Y|X) over label sequence giveninput sequence.
A number of conditional models recently have been developed foruse.
They showed better performance than generative models as they can handlemany arbitrary and overlapping features of input sequence [12].A number of methods are applied to chunking in Korean texts.
Unlike English, arule-based chunking method [7,8] is predominantly used in Korean because of itswell-developed function words, which contain information such as grammatical156 Y.-H. Lee, M.-Y.
Kim, and J.-H. Leerelation, case, tense, modal, etc.
Chunking in Korean texts with only simple heuristicrules obtained through observation on the text shows a good performance similar toother machine learning methods [6].
Park et al proposed a hybrid of rule-based andmachine learning method to handle exceptional cases of the rules, to improve theperformance of chunking in Korean texts [5,6].In this paper, we present how CRFs, a recently introduced probabilistic model forlabeling and segmenting sequence of data [12], can be applied to the task of chunkingin Korean texts.
CRFs are undirected graphical models trained to maximize condi-tional probabilities of label sequence given input sequence.
It takes advantage of gen-erative and conditional models.
CRFs can include many correlated, overlapping fea-tures, and they are trained discriminatively like conditional model.
Since CRFs havesingle exponential model for the conditional probability of entire label sequence giveninput sequence, they also guarantee to obtain globally optimal label sequence.
CRFssuccessfully have been applied in many NLP problems such as part-of-speech tagging[12], text chunking [13,15] and table extraction from government reports [19].The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 gives a simple introductionto CRFs.
Section 3 explains how CRFs is applied to the task of chunking in Koreantexts.
Finally, we present experimental results and draw conclusions.2   Conditional Random FieldsConditional Random Fields (CRFs) are conditional probabilistic sequence modelsfirst introduced by Lefferty et al[12].
CRFs are undirected graphical models, whichcan be used to define the joint probability distribution over label sequence given theentire input sequence to be labeled, rather than being directed graphical models suchas Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs) [11].
It relaxes the strong inde-pendence assumption of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), as well as resolves thelabel bias problem exhibited by MEMMs and other non-generative directed graphicalmodels such as discriminative Markov models [12].2.1   Fundamentals of CRFsCRFs may be viewed as an undirected graphical model globally conditioned on inputsequence [14].
Let X=x1 x2 x3 ?xn be an input sequence and Y=y1 y2 y3 ?yn a label se-quence.
In the chunking task, X is associated with a sequence of words and Y is asso-ciated with a sequence of chunk types.
If we assume that the structure of a graphforms a simple first-order chain, as illustrated in Figure 1, CRFs define the condi-tional probability of a label sequence Y given an input sequence X by the Hammer-sley-Clifford theorem [16] as follows:?????
?= ??
?i kiikk iXyyfXZXYp ),,,(exp)(1)|( 1?
(1)where Z(X) is a normalization factor; fk(yi-1, yi, X, i) is a feature function at positions iand i-1 in the label sequence; k?
is  a weight associated with feature kf .Chunking Using Conditional Random Fields in Korean Texts 157Fig.

and k?
are parame-ters to be estimated from training data.
The parameters k?

play similar roles tothe transition and emission probabilities in HMMs [12].
Therefore, the most probablelabel sequence for input sequence X is Y* which maximizes a posterior probability.

(4)It is not possible to analytically determine the parameter values that maximize thelog-likelihood.
Instead, maximum likelihood parameters must be identified using aniterative technique such as iterative scaling [12] or gradient-based methods [13,14].Lafferty et al proposed two iterative scaling algorithms to find parameters forCRFs.
However, these methods converge into a global maximum very slowly.
To158 Y.-H. Lee, M.-Y.
Kim, and J.-H. Leeovercome this problem of slow convergence, several researchers adopted modernoptimization algorithms such as the conjugate-gradient method or the limited-memoryBFGS(L-BFGS) method [17].3   Chunking Using Conditional Random Fields in Korean TextsWe now describe how CRFs are applied to the task of chunking in Korean texts.Firstly, we explore characteristics and chunk types of Korean.
Then we explain thefeatures for the model of chunking in Korean texts using CRFs.
The ultimate goal of achunker is to output appropriate chunk tags of a sequence of words with part-of-speech tags.3.1   Characteristics of KoreanKorean is an agglutinative language, in which a word unit (called an eojeol) is a com-position of a content word and function word(s).
Function words ?
postpositions andendings ?
give much information such as grammatical relation, case, tense, modal,etc.
Well-developed function words in Korean help with chunking, especially NP andVP chunking.
For example, when the part-of-speech of current word is one of deter-miner, pronoun and noun, the following seven rules for NP chunking in Table 1 canfind most NP chunks in text, with about 89% accuracy [6].Table 1.
Rules for NP chunking in Korean textsNo Previous eojeol Chunk tag of current word1 determiner I-NP2 pronoun I-NP3 noun I-NP4 noun + possessive postposition I-NP5 noun + relative postfix I-NP6 adjective + relative ending I-NP7 others B-NPFor this reason, boundaries of chunks are easily found in Korean, compared toother languages such as English or Chinese.
This is why a rule-based chunkingmethod is predominantly used.
However, with sophisticated rules, the rule-basedchunking method has limitations when handling exceptional cases.
Park et al pro-posed a hybrid of the rule-based and the machine learning method to resolve thisproblem [5,6].
Many recent machine learning techniques can capture hidden charac-teristics for classification.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, the rule-based methodhas recently been outdone by the machine learning method in various classificationproblems.3.2   Chunk Types of KoreanAbney was the first to use the term ?chunk?
to represent a non-recursive core of anintra-clausal constituent, extending from the beginning of constituent to its head.
InChunking Using Conditional Random Fields in Korean Texts 159Korean, there are four basic phrases: noun phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP), adverbphrase (ADVP), and independent phrase (IP) [6].
As function words such as postposi-tion or ending are well-developed, the number of chunk types is small compared toother languages such as English or Chinese.
Table 2 lists the Korean chunk types, asimple explanation and examples of each chunk type.Table 2.

([wow] [this] [very] [is delicious])Like the CoNLL-2000 dataset, we use three types of chunk border tags, indicatingwhether a word is outside a chunk (O), starts a chunk (B), or continues a chunk (I).Each chunk type XP has two border tags: B-XP and I-XP.
XP should be one of NP,VP, ADVP and IP.
There exist nine chunk tags in Korean.3.3   Feature Set of CRFsOne advantage of CRFs is that they can use many arbitrary, overlapping features.
Sowe take advantage of all context information of a current word.
We use words, part-of-speech tags of context and combinations of part-of-speech tags to determine thechunk tag of the current word,.
The window size of context is 5; from left two wordsto right two words.
Table 3 summarizes the feature set for chunking in Korean texts.Table 3.

An example of the STEP 2000 datasetThe STEP 2000 dataset consists of 12,092 sentences.
We divide this corpus intotraining data and test data.
Training data has 10,883 sentences and test data has1,209 sentences, 90% and 10% respectively.
Table 4 summarizes characteristics ofthe STEP 2000 dataset.
Figure 2 shows an example sentence of the STEP 2000 data-set and its format is equal to that of CoNLL-2000 dataset.
Each line is composed of aword, its part-of-speech (POS) tag and a chunk tag.4.2   Evaluation MetricThe standard evaluation metrics for chunking performance are precision, recall and F-score (F?=1) [3].
F-score is used for comparisons with other reported results.
Eachequation is defined as follows.1STEP is an abbreviation of Software Technology Enhancement Program.
We download thisdataset from http://bi.snu.ac.kr/~sbpark/Step2000.

(7)4.3   Experimental ResultsExperiments were performed with C++ implementation of CRFs (FlexCRFs) onLinux with 2.4 GHz Pentium IV dual processors and 2.0Gbyte of main memory [18].We use L-BFGS to train the parameters and use a Gaussian prior regularization inorder to avoid overfitting [20].Table 5.

As shown in Table 5, the performances ofmost chunk type are 96~100%, very high performance.
However, the performance ofNP chunk type is lowest, 94.27% because the border of NP chunk type is very am-biguous in case of consecutive nouns.
Using more features such as previous chunk tagshould be able to improve the performance of NP chunk type.Table 6.

We add theexperimental results of the chunking methods using HMMs-bigram and CRFs.In Table 6, F-score of chunking using CRFs in Korean texts is 97.19%, the highest2Performances of all methods except HMMs and CRFs are cited from the experiment of Parket al[6].
They also use the STEP 2000 dataset and similar feature set.
Therefore, the compari-son of performance is reasonable.162 Y.-H. Lee, M.-Y.
Kim, and J.-H. Leeperformance of all.
It significantly outperforms all others, including machine learningmethods, rule-based methods and hybrid methods.
It is because CRFs have a globaloptimum solution hence overcoming the label bias problem.
They also can use manyarbitrary, overlapping features.Figure 3 shows the performance curve on the same test set in terms of the preci-sion, recall and F-score with respect to the size of training data.
In this figure, we cansee that the performance slowly increases in proportion to the size of training data.Fig.

The performance curve respect to the size of training dataIn the experiment, we can see that CRFs can help improve the performance ofchunking in Korean texts.
CRFs have many promising properties except for the slowconvergence speed compared to other models.
In the next experiment, we have triedto analyze the importance of each feature and to make an additional experiment withvarious window sizes and any other useful features.5   ConclusionIn this paper, we proposed a chunking method for Korean texts using CRFs.
We ob-served that the proposed method outperforms other approaches.
Experiments on theSTEP 2000 dataset showed that the proposed method yields an F-score of 95.36%.This performance is 2.82% higher than that of SVMs and 1.15% higher than that ofthe hybrid method.
CRFs use a number of correlated features and overcome the labelbias problem.
We obtained a very high performance using only small features.
Thus,if we use more features such as semantic information or collocation, we can obtain abetter performance.From the experiment, we know that the proposed method using CRFs can signifi-cantly improve the performance of chunking in Korean texts.
CRFs are a good frame-work for labeling an input sequence.
In our future work, we will investigate howCRFs can be applied to other NLP problems: parsing, semantic analysis and spamfiltering.
Finally, we hope that this work can contribute to the body of research inthis field.Chunking Using Conditional Random Fields in Korean Texts 163AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the KOSEF through the Advanced Information Technol-ogy Research Center (AITrc) and by the BK21 Project.References1.
