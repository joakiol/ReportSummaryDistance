Proceedings of COLING 2014, the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers,pages 109?120, Dublin, Ireland, August 23-29 2014.Query-by-Example Image Retrievalusing Visual Dependency RepresentationsDesmond Elliott, Victor Lavrenko and Frank KellerInstitute of Language, Communication, and ComputationSchool of InformaticsUniversity of Edinburghd.elliott@ed.ac.uk {vlavrenk,keller}@inf.ed.ac.ukAbstractImage retrieval models typically represent images as bags-of-terms, a representation that is well-suited to matching images based on the presence or absence of terms.
For some informationneeds, such as searching for images of people performing actions, it may be useful to retain dataabout how parts of an image relate to each other.
If the underlying representation of an imagecan distinguish between images where objects only co-occur from images where people are in-teracting with objects, then it should be possible to improve retrieval performance.
In this paperwe model the spatial relationships between image regions using Visual Dependency Represen-tations, a structured image representation that makes it possible to distinguish between objectco-occurrence and interaction.
In a query-by-example image retrieval experiment on data setof people performing actions, we find an 8.8% relative increase in MAP and an 8.6% relativeincrease in Precision@10 when images are represented using the Visual Dependency Represen-tation compared to a bag-of-terms baseline.1 IntroductionEvery day millions of people search for images on the web, both professionally and for personal amuse-ment.
The majority of image searches are aimed at finding a particular named entity, such as JustinBieber or supernova, and a typical image retrieval system is well-suited to this type of information needbecause it represents an image as a bag-of-terms drawn from data surrounding the image, such as text,manual tags, and anchor text (Datta et al., 2008).
It is not always possible to find useful terms in the sur-rounding data; the last decade has seen advances in automatic methods for assigning terms to images thathave neither user-assigned tags, nor a textual description (Duygulu et al., 2002; Lavrenko et al., 2003;Guillaumin and Mensink, 2009).
These automatic methods learn to associate the presence and absenceof labels with the visual characteristics of an image, such as colour and texture distributions, shape, andpoints of interest, and can automatically generate a bag of terms for an unlabelled image.It is important to remember that not all information needs are entity-based: people also search for im-ages reflecting a mood, such as people having fun at a party, or an action, such as using a computer.
Thebag-of-terms representation is limited to matching images based on the presence or absence of terms,and not the relation of the terms to each other.
Figures 1(a) and (b) highlight the problem with usingunstructured representations for image retrieval: there is a person and a computer in both images but only(a) depicts a person actually using the computer.
To address this problem with unstructured represen-tations we propose to represent the structure of an image using the Visual Dependency Representation(Elliott and Keller, 2013).
The Visual Dependency Representation is a directed labelled graph over theregions of an image that captures the spatial relationships between regions.
The representation is inspiredby evidence from the psychology literature that people are better at recognising and searching for objectswhen the spatial relationships between the objects in the image are consistent with our expectations ofthe world.

The gold-standard action annotation isshown in the yellow bounding box.and Keller (2013) showed that encoding the spatial relationships between objects in the Visual Depen-dency Representation helped to generate significantly better descriptions than approaches based on thespatial proximity of objects (Farhadi et al., 2010) or corpus-based models (Yang et al., 2011).
In thispaper we study whether the Visual Dependency Representation of images can improve the performanceof query-by-example image retrieval models.
The main finding is that encoding images using the VisualDependency Representation leads to significantly better retrieval accuracy compared to a bag-of-termsbaseline, and that the improvements are most pronounced for transitive verbs.2 Related Work2.1 Representing ImagesA central problem in image retrieval is how to abstractly represent images (Datta et al., 2008).
A bag-of-terms representation of an image is created by grouping visual features, such as color, shape (Shiand Malik, 2000), texture, and interest points (Lowe, 1999), in a vector or as a probability distributionover the features.
Image retrieval can then be performed by trying to find the best matchings of termsacross an image collection.
Spatial Pyramid Matching is an approach to constructing low-level imagerepresentations that capture the relationships between features at differently sized partitions of the im-age (Lazebnik et al., 2006).
This approach has proven successful for scene categorisation tasks.
Analternative approach to representing images is to learn a mapping (Duygulu et al., 2002; Lavrenko et al.,1102003; Guillaumin and Mensink, 2009) between the bags-of-terms and object tags.
An image can then berepresented as a bag-of-terms and image retrieval is similar to text retrieval (Wu et al., 2012).In this work, we represent an image as a directed acyclic graph over a set of labeled object regionannotations.
This representation captures the important spatial relationships between the image regionsand makes it possible to distinguish between co-occurring regions and interacting regions.2.2 Still-Image Action RecognitionOne approach to recognizing actions is to learn appearance models for visual phrases and use thesemodels to predict actions (Sadeghi and Farhadi, 2011).
A visual phrase is defined as the people and theobjects they interact with in an action.
In this approach, a fixed number of visual phrase models aretrained using the deformable parts object detector (Felzenszwalb et al., 2010) and used to perform actionrecognition.An alternative approach is to model the relationships between objects in an image, and hence thevisible actions, as a Conditional Random Field (CRF), where each node in the field is an object and thefactors between nodes correspond to features that capture the relationships between the objects (Zitnicket al., 2013).
The factors between object nodes in the CRF include object occurrence, absolute position,person attributes, and the relative location of pairs of objects.
This model has been used to generate novelimages of people performing actions and to retrieve images of people performing actions.Most recently, actions have been predicted in images by selecting the most likely verb and object pairgiven a set of candidate objects detected in an image (Le et al., 2013a).
The verb and object is selectedamongst those that maximize the distributional similarity of the pair in a large and diverse collection ofdocuments.
This approach is most similar to ours but it relies on an external corpus and, depending onthe text collections used to train the distributional model, will compound the problem of co-occurrenceof objects instead of the relationships between the objects.The work presented in this paper uses ground-truth annotation for region labels, an assumption similarto (Zitnick et al., 2013), but requires no external data to make predictions of the relationships betweenobjects, unlike the approach of (Le et al., 2013a).
The directed acyclic graph representation we proposefor images can be seen as a latent representation of the depicted action in the image, where the spatialrelationships between the regions capture the different types of actions.3 Task and BaselineIn this paper we study the task of query-by-example image retrieval within the restricted domain ofimages depicting actions.
More specifically, given an image that depicts a given action, such as using acomputer, the aim of the retrieval model is to find all other images in the image collection that depict thesame action.
We define an action as an event involving one or more entities in an image, e.g., a womanrunning or boy using a computer, and assume all images have been manually annotated for objects.
Thisassumption means we can explore the utility of the Visual Dependency Representation without the noiseintroduced by automatic computer vision methods.
The data available to the retrieval models can be seenin Figure 1, and Section 5 provides further details about the different sources of data The action label -which is only used for evaluation - is shown in the labelled bounding box, and the Visual DependencyRepresentation - not used by the baseline model - is shown as a tree at the bottom of the figure.The main hypothesis explored in this paper is that the accuracy of an image retrieval model willincrease if the representation encodes information about the relationships between the objects in images.This hypothesis is tested by encoding images as either an unstructured bag-of-terms representation oras the structured Visual Dependency Representation.
The Bag-of-Terms baseline represents the queryimage and the image collection as an unstructured bags-of-terms vector.
All of the models used to testthe main hypothesis use the cosine similarity function is to determine the similarity of the query imageto other images in the collection, and thus to generate a ranked list from the similarity values.1114 Visual Dependency RepresentationThe Visual Dependency Representation (VDR) is a structured representation of an image that captures thespatial relationships between pairs of image regions in a directed labelled graph.
The Visual DependencyGrammar defines eight possible spatial relationships between pairs of regions, as shown in Table 1.The relationships in the grammar were designed to provide sufficient coverage of the types of spatialrelationships required to describe the data, and are mathematically defined in terms of pixel overlap,distance between regions, and the angle between regions.
The frame of reference for annotating spatialrelationships is the image itself and not the object in the image, and angles and distance measurementsare taken or estimated from the centroids of the regions.
The VDR of an image is created by a trainedhuman annotator in a two-stage process:1.
The annotator draws and labels boundaries around the parts of the image they think contribute todefining the action depicted in the image, and the context within which the action occurs;2.
The annotator draws labelled directed edges between the annotated regions that captures how therelationships between the image convey the action.
In Section 4.1, we will explain how to automatethe second stage of the process from a collection of labelled region annotations.In addition to the annotated image regions, a VDR also contains a ROOT node, which acts as a place-holder for the image.
In the remainder of this section we describe how a gold-standard VDR is createdby a human annotator.
The starting point for the VDR in Figure 1(a) is the following set of regions andthe ROOT node:ROOT Lamp Picture Girl Laptop BedFirst, the regions are attached to each other based on how the relationship between the objects con-tributes to the depicted action.
In Figure 1(a), the Girl is using the Laptop, therefore a labelled directededge is created from the Girl region to the Laptop region.
The spatial relationship is labelled as BESIDE.ROOT Lamp Picture Girl Laptop BedbesideThe Girl is also attached to the Bed because the bed supports her body.
The spatial relation label isABOVE because it expresses the spatial relationship between the regions, not the semantic relationshipON.
ROOT is attached to the Girl without an edge label to symbolize that she is an actor in the image.ROOT Lamp Picture Girl Laptop BedbesideaboveNow the regions that are not concerned with the depicted action are first attached to each other if thereis a clear spatial relationship between them (for an example, see Figure 1(b), where the laptop is attachedto the table because it is sitting on the table), and then to the ROOT node to signify that they do not playa part in the depicted action.
In this example, neither the Lamp nor the Picture are related to the actionof using the computer, so they are attached to the ROOT node.112X?

Tosimplify explanation, all regions are circles, where X is the grey region and Y is the white region.
Allrelations are considered with respect to the centroid of a region and the angle between those centroids.ROOT Lamp Picture Girl Laptop BedbesideaboveThis now forms a completed VDR for the image in Figure 1(a).
This structured representation ofan image captures the prominent relationship between the girl, the laptop, and the bed.
There is noprominent relationship defined between the girl and either the lamp of the picture, in effect these regionshave been relegated to background objects.
The central hypothesis underpinning the Visual DependencyRepresentation is that images that contain similar VDR substructures are more likely to depict the sameaction than images that only contain the same set of objects.
For example, the VDR for Figure 1(a)correctly captures the relationship between the people and the laptops, whereas this relationship is notpresent in Figure 1(b), where the person is playing a trumpet.4.1 Predicting Visual Dependency RepresentationsWe follow the approach of Elliott and Keller (2013) and predict the VDR y of an image over a collectionof labelled region annotations x.
This task is framed as a supervised learning problem, where the aim isto construct a Maximum Spanning Tree from a fully-connected directed weighted graph over the labelledregions (McDonald et al., 2005).
Reducing the fully-connected graph to the Maximum Spanning Treeremoves the region?region edges that are not important in defining the prominent relationships betweenthe regions in an image.
The score of the VDR y over the image regions is calculated as the sum of thescores of the directed labelled edges:score(x, y) =?
(a,b)?yw ?
f(a, b) (1)where the score of an edge between image regions a and b is calculated using a vector of weighted featurefunctions f .
The feature functions characterize the image regions and the edge between pairs of regions,and include: the labels of the regions and the spatial relation annotated on the edge; the (normalized)distance between the centroids of the regions; the angle formed between the annotated regions, which is113mapped onto the set of spatial relations; the relative size of the region compared to the image; and thedistance of the region centroid from the center of the image.The model is trained over i instances of region-annotated images xiassociated with human-createdVDR structures yi, Itrain= {xi, yi}.
The score of each edge a, b is calculated by applying the featurefunctions to the data associated with that edge, and this is performed over each edge in a VDR to obtaina score for a complete gold-standard structure.
The parameters of the weight vector w are iterativelyadjusted to maximise the score of the gold-standard structures in the training data using the MarginInfused Relaxation Algorithm (Crammer and Singer, 2002).The test data contains i instances of region-annotated images with image regions xi, Itest= {xi}.The parsing model computes the highest scoring structure y?ifor each instance in the test data by scoringeach possible directed edge between pairs of regions in xi.
This process forms a fully-connected graphover the image regions, from which the Maximum Spanning Tree is taken and returned as the predictedVDR.We evaluate the performance of this VDR prediction model by comparing how well it can recoverthe manually created trees in the data set.
This evaluation is performed on the development data in a10-fold cross validation setting where each fold of the data is split 80%/10%/10%.
Unlabelled directedaccuracy means the model correctly proposes an edge between a pair of regions in the correct direction;Labelled directed accuracy means it additionally proposes the correct edge label.
The baseline approachis to assume no latent image structure and attach all image regions to the ROOT node of the VDR; thisachieves 51.6% labelled and unlabelled directed attachment accuracy.
The accuracy of our automaticapproach to VDR prediction is 61.3% labelled and 68.8% unlabelled attachment accuracy.4.2 Comparing Visual Dependency RepresentationsIt remains to define how to compare the Visual Dependency Representation of a pair of images.
The mostobvious approach is to use the labelled directed accuracy measurement used for the VDR predictionevaluation in the previous section, but we did not find significant improvements in retrieval accuracyusing this method.
We hypothesise that the lack of weight given to the edges between nodes in the VisualDependency Representation results in this comparison function not distinguishing between object?objectrelationships that matter, such as PERSON????
?beside BIKE, compared to ROOT ??
TREES.
The formeris a potential person?object relationship that explains the depicted event, whereas the latter is only abackground object.The approach we adopted in this paper is to compare Visual Dependency Representations of imagesby decomposing the structure into a set of labelled and a unlabelled parent?child subtrees in a depth-firsttraversal of the VDR.
The decomposition process allows use to use the same similarity function as theBag-of-Terms baseline model, removing the confound of choosing different similarity functions.
Thesubtrees can be transformed into tokens and these tokens can be used as weighted terms in a vectorrepresentation.
An example of a labelled transformation is shown below:Girl Bed ?
Girl above BedaboveWe now demonstrate the outcome of comparing images represented using either a vector that con-catenates the decomposed transformed VDR and bag-of-terms, or a vector that contains only the bag-of-terms.
In this demonstration, each term has a tf-idf weight of 1.
The first illustration (Similar) comparesimages that depict the same underlying action: Figure 1 (a) and (c).
The second illustration (Dissimilar)compares images that depict different actions: Figure 1 (a) and (b).Similar : cos(VDRa,VDRc) = 0.56 > cos(Baga,Bagc) = 0.52Dissimilar : cos(VDRb,VDRa) = 0.201 cos(Bagb,Baga) = 0.4It can be seen that when the images represent the same action, the decomposed VDR increases thesimilarity of the pair of images compared to the bag-of-terms representation; and when images do not114represent the same action, the decomposed VDR yields a lower similarity than the bag-of-terms repre-sentation.
These illustrations confirm that Visual Dependency Representations can be used to distinguishthe difference between presence or absence of objects, and the prominent relationships between objects.5 DataWe use an existing dataset of VDR-annotated images to study whether modelling the structure of animage can improve image retrieval in the domain of action depictions.
The data set of Elliott and Keller(2013) contains 341 images annotated with region annotations, three visual dependency representationsper image (making a total of 1,023 instances), and a ground-truth action label for each image.
Anexample of the annotations can be seen in Figure 1.
The image collection is drawn from the PASCALVisual Object Classification Challenge 2011 action recognition taster and covers a set of 10 actions(Everingham et al., 2011): riding a bike, riding a horse, reading, running, jumping, walking, playing aninstrument, using a computer, taking a photo, and talking on the phone.Image DescriptionsEach image is associated with three human-written descriptions collected from untrained annotatorson Amazon Mechanical Turk.
The descriptions do not form any part of the models presented in thecurrent paper; they were used in the automatic image description task of Elliott and Keller (2013).
Eachdescription contains two sentences: the first sentence describes the action depicted in the image, andthe second sentence describes other objects not involved in the action.
A two sentence description ofan image helps distinguish objects that are central to depicting the action from objects that may bedistractors.Region AnnotationsThe images contain human-drawn labelled region annotations.
The annotations were drawn using theLabelMe toolkit, which allows for arbitrary labelled polygons to be created over an image (Russellet al., 2008).
The annotated regions were restricted to those present in at least one of three human-written descriptions.
To reduce the effects of label sparsity, frequently occurring equivalent labels wereconflated, i.e., man, child, and boy?
person; bike, bicycle, motorbike?
bike; this reduced the objectlabel vocabulary from 496 labels to 362 labels.
The data set contains a total of 5,034 region annotations,with a mean of 4.19 ?
1.94 annotations per image.Visual Dependency RepresentationsRecall that each image is associated with three descriptions, and that people were free to decide how todescribe the action and background of the image.
The differences between how people describe imagesleads to the creation of one Visual Dependency Representation per image?description pair in the dataset, resulting in a total of 1,023 instances.
The process for creating a visual dependency representationof an image is described in Section 4.
The annotated dataset comprises a total of 5,748 spatial relations,corresponding to a mean of 4.79 ?
3.51 relations per image.
Elliott and Keller (2013) report inter-annotator agreement on a subset of the data at 84% agreement for labelled directed attachments and95.1% for unlabelled directed attachments.Action LabelsThe original PASCAL action recognition dataset contains ground truth action class annotations for eachimage.
These annotations are in the form of labelled bounding boxes around the person performing theaction in the image.
The action labels are only used as the gold-standard relevance judgements for thequery-by-example image retrieval experiments.6 ExperimentsIn this section we present the results of a query-by-example image retrieval experiment to determinethe utility of the Visual Dependency Representation compared to a bag-of-terms representation.

For each query we compute average precision and Precision@10 of the ranked list, and use theresulting values to test the statistical significance of the results.The training set is used to train the VDR prediction model and to estimate inverse document frequencystatistics.
During the training phase, the VDR-based models have access to region boundaries, regionlabels and three manually-created VDRs for each training image.
In the test set, all models have access tothe region boundaries and labels for each image.
Each image in the test set forms a query and the modelsproduce a ranked list of the remaining images in the test collection.
Images are marked for relevanceas follows: a image at rank r is considered relevant if it has the same action label as the query image;otherwise it is non-relevant.
The dev set was used to experiment with different matching functions andto optimise the feature functions used in the VDR prediction model.6.2 ModelsWe compare the retrieval accuracy of three approaches: Bag-of-Terms uses an unstructured representa-tion for each image.
A tf-idf weight is assigned to each region label in an image, and the cosine measureis used to calculate the similarity of images.
This model allows us to compare the usefulness of a struc-tured vs. unstructured image representation.
Automatic VDR is a model using the VDR predictionmethod from Section 4.1, and Manual VDR uses the gold-standard data described in Section 5.

The MAP of the Automatic VDR model increasesby 8.8% relative to the Bag-of-Terms model, and a relative improvement up to 10.1% would possible ifwe had a better structure prediction model, as evidenced by Manual VDR.
Furthermore, if we assume auser will only view the top results returned by the retrieval model, then P@10 increases by 8.6% when wemodel the structure of an image, relative to using an unstructured representation; a relative improvementof up to 9.4% would be possible if we had a better image parser.To determine whether the differences are statistically significant, we perform the Wilcoxon SignedRanks Test on the average precision and P@10 values over the 1011 queries in our cross-validationdata set.
The results support the main hypothesis of this paper: structured image representations allowus to find images depicting actions more accurately than the standard bag-of-terms representation.
Wefind significant differences in average precision and P@10 between the Bag-of-Terms baseline and bothAutomatic VDR (p < 0.01) and Manual VDR (p < 0.01).
This suggests that structure is very useful inthe query-by-example scenario.
We find a significant difference in average precision between AutomaticVDR and Manual VDR (p < 0.01), but no difference in P@10 between Automatic VDR and ManualVDR (p = 0.442).6.4 Retrieval Performance by Type of Action and VerbWe now analyse whether image structure is useful when the action does not require a direct object.
Theanalysis presented here compares the Bag-of-Terms model against the Automatic VDR model becausethere was no significant difference in P@10 between the Automatic and Manual VDR models.
Table 3shows the MAP and Precision@10 per type of action.
Figure 3 shows the precision/recall curves for (a)transitive verbs, (b) intransitive verbs, and (c) light verbs.In Figure 3(a), it can be seen that the actions that can be classified as transitive verbs benefit fromexploiting the structure encoded in the Visual Dependency Representation.
The only exception is for theaction to read, which frequently behaves as an intransitive verb: the man reads on a train.
The consistentimprovement in both the entirety of the ranked list and at the top of the ranked list can be seen in theMAP and P@10 results in Table 3.Figure 3(b) shows that there is a small increase in retrieval performance for intransitive verbs comparedto the transitive verbs.
We conjecture this is because there are fewer objects to annotate in an image whenthe verb does not require a direct object.
The summary results for the intransitive verbs in Table 3 confirmthe small but insignificant increase in MAP and P@10.Finally, the light verbs, shown in Figure 3(c), exhibit variable behaviour in retrieval performance.
Onereason for this could be that if the light verb encodes information about the object, as in using a computer,then the computer can be annotated in the image, and thus it acts as a transitive verb.

VDR is the Automatic VDR model and Bag is theBag-of-Terms model.
It can be seen that the Automatic VDR retrieval model is consistently better thanthe Bag-of-Terms model on both MAP and Precision@10.
?
: the Automatic VDR model is significantlydifferent than Bag-of-Terms at p < 0.01.118the light verb conveys information about the outcome of the event, as in the action take a photograph,the outcome is rarely possible to annotate in an image, and so no improvements can be gained fromstructured image representations.6.5 DiscussionIn our experiments we observed that all models can achieve high precision at very low levels of recall.
Wefound that this happens for testing images that are almost identical to the query image.
For such images,objects that are unrelated to the target action form an effective context, which allows this image to beplaced at the top of the ranking.
However, near-identical images are relatively rare, and performancedegrades for higher levels of recall.It is surprising that image retrieval using automatically predicted VDR model is statistically indistin-guishable from the manually crafted VDR model, given the relatively low accuracy of our VDR predic-tion model: 61.3% by the labelled dependency attachment accuracy measure.
One possible explanationcould be that not all parts of the VDR structure are useful for retrieval purposes, and our VDR predictionmodel does well on the useful ones.
This observation also suggests that we are unlikely to achieve betterretrieval performance by continuing to improve the accuracy of VDR prediction.
We believe a morepromising direction is refining the current formulation of the VDR, and exploring more sophisticatedways to measure the similarity of two structured representations.7 ConclusionIn this paper we argued that a limiting factor of retrieving images depicting actions is the unstructuredbag-of-terms representation typically used for images.
In a bag-of-terms representation, images thatshare similar sets of regions are deemed to be related even when the depicted actions are different.
Weproposed that representing an image using the Visual Dependency Representation (VDR) can preventthis type of misclassification in image retrieval.
The VDR of an image captures the region?region re-lationships that explain what is happening in an image, and it can be automatically predicted from aregion-annotated image.In a query-by-example image retrieval task, we found that representing images as automatically pre-dicted VDRs resulted in statistically significant 8.8% relative improvement in MAP and 8.6% relativeimprovement in Precision@10 compared to a Bag-of-Terms model.
There was a significant differencein MAP when using manually or automatically predicted image structures, but no difference in the Pre-cision@10, suggesting that the proposed automatic prediction model is accurate enough for retrievalpurposes.
Future work will focus on using automatically generated visual input, such as the output ofthe image tagger (Guillaumin and Mensink, 2009), or an automatic object detector (Felzenszwalb et al.,2010), which will make it possible to tackle image ranking tasks (Hodosh et al., 2013).
It would also beinteresting to explore alternative structure prediction methods, such as predicting the relationships usinga conditional random field (Zitnick et al., 2013), or by leveraging distributional lexical semantics (Le etal., 2013b).AcknowledgmentsThe anonymous reviewers provided valuable feedback on this paper.
