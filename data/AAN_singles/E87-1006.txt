A GENERATIVE GRAMMAR APPROACH FOR THE MORPHOLOGIC ANDMORPHOSYNTACTIC ANALYSIS OF ITALIANMarina RussoIBM Rome Scientific Centervia del Giorgione, 12900147 Rome ItalyABSTRACTA morphologic and morphosyntactic analyzer for the Italianlanguage has been implemented in VM/Prolog 131 at the IBM RomcScientific Center as part of a project on text understanding.Aim of this project is the development of a prototype whichanalyzes hort narrative texts (press agency news) and gives a formalrepresentation f their "meaning" as a set of first order logicexpressions.
Question answering features are also provided.The morphologic analyzer processes every word by means of acontext free grammar, in order to obtain its morphologic andsyntactic haracteristics.It also performs a morphosyntactic analysis to recognize fixedand variable sequences of words such as idioms, date cxpressi{~ns,compound tenses of verbs and comparative and superlative form~ ofadjectives.The lexicon is stored in a relational data base under thc controlof SQL/DS \[2\], while the endings of the grammar are stored in thcworkspace as Proiog facts.A friendly interface written in GDDM \[11 allows the uscr tointroduce on line the missing lemmata, in order to directly ulxlatc thcdictionary.IntroductionAbout thirty years ago, the development of decripting tccniquesmade computer scientists be involved for the first time in the field ofLinguistics, especially in automatic translation matters.The failure of most of these projects contributed to a generalsensibilization towards natural language problems, and gave rise to avariety of formal theories for their treatment.In the last few years, one of the main research objectives ix-camethe design of systems able to acquire knowledge directly from fcxts.using natural language as an interface between man and machine.At the IBM Rome Scientific Center a system has been developedfor processing Italian texts.
The task of the system is to?
analyze short narrative texts (press agency news) on a restricteddomain (Economics and Finance),?
give the formal representation f their "meaning" as a set of firstorder logic expressions, tored in a knowledge base,?
consult this knowledge base in order to answer any qucstlonabout he contents of analyzed texts.The system consists of:?
a mmphologie analyzer based on a context-free logic grammarwith the "word" as axiom and its possible components asterminal nodes.
It.includes a lexic9n of about 7000 elementarylemmata, structured in a table of a relational data base under thecontrol of SQL/DS.
* a morphosyntaetic analyzer ealized by three regular grammars,recognizing respectively compound tenses of verbs (e,g.
ha.~ beensigned), comparative and superlative forms of adjectives (e.g.
Ihemost interesting) and compound numbers (e.g.
three billions .~64millions 234.000).
This module reduces the number of possiblesyntactic relations among the words of the sentence in order tosimplify the task of the syntax.
* a syntactic parser developed by means of a meta-analyzcr \[6\[which aUows to write production rules for attribute gntmmars,and generates from these the corresponding top-down parser.
Agrammar has been written to describe the fragment of Italianconsider.~l.?
a semantic la'oe~sm ?
based on the Conceptual Graphs formal;sin\[10\] and provided, with a semantic dictionary containing atpresent about 350 concepts.
Its task is to solve syntacticambiguities and recognize semantic relations between the wordsof the sentence 191.This paper deals in particular with the structure of the lexiconadopted in tht: system and with the morhologic and morhosynlacticanalyzer.In this system the morphology and the lexicon are strictlycombined; for this reason this lexicon does not contain semanlicinformation.
In the approach of Alinei \[4\], on the contrary, lexiconstructures contain semantic information in order to describe everyword also in te~qns of its "meaning"Another possible approach is the one adopted by Zampolli whodeveloped a frequency lexicon of Italian language at tileComputational Linguistic Institute in Pisa \[5\].
The lexicon realizedby ZampoUi's working group containes morphologie hints in order toguide directly the analysis of every word, without the support of amorphologic p~ rser.in most of the works referring to English language morphology isconsidered onl) as a part of the syntactic parser.
On the contrary.Italian morpho'ogy requires to be previously analyzed because it ismore complex: there are more rules than in English and these ridespresent many exceptions.For this reason, in the last few years Italian researchers began toface systematically these problems beside a purely linguistic onlcxkA procedural approach is the one followed by Stock in thedevelopment of a morphologlc analyzer realized for lhe"Wednesday2" parser I 11\[.A different approach makes use of formal grammars to describethe rules of Italian morphology.
This morhologic analyzer is basedon a context free grammar describing the logic rules for the wordgeneration.
Other two morphologic systems have been developedaccording to the ATN formalism (Augmcuted Transition Network).The fast one has been realized at the CNR Institute of I'is~ byMorreale, Campagnola and MugeUesi, as a research tool for teachingItalian morphology, with applications in automatic processin?
of32natural anguage and knowledge representation 18\].
The second onehas been realized by Delmonte, Mian, Omologo and Satta, as part ofa system for the development of a reading machine for blind people.171.In the first section of this paper there is a brief discussion atx, utmorphologic problems and about the possible approaches to theirsolution.The next section describes the structure adopted for the lexiconand the other sets of data.The third section deals with a preanalyzer, which simplifies thework of morphologie analysis by recognizing standard sequences ofwords, as idioms and date expressions.In the fourth section the morphologic analyzer is described andin the last one the morphosyntactic analyzer, both realized by meansof context free grammars.The problemThe aim of morphology is to retrieve from every analyzed wordthe lemma it derives from, its syntactic ategory (e.g.
verb, .
.un,adjective, conjunction .
.
.
.  )
and its morphologic catego~ (e.g.masculine, singular, indicative .... ).A possible approach to the problem is to store in a data base alist of all the declined forms for every lemma of the language, as wellas their morphologic, syntactic and semantic haracteristics.The size of such a list would be enormous, because a commondictionary contains about 50000-100000 lemmata and each lemmagives rise to several derived words and each word may be declined indifferent ways.Such a large data base is hard to enter and to update, and it islimited by the fixed size of its words list.In Italian, the creation of words is a generative proces~ ~hatfollows several roles like, for instance:HANO(hand)---> verbalization ---> HAN-EGGIARE(to hand-le)---> composition ---> PALLA-MANO(hand-ball)---> olitlcization ---> RI-MAN-EGGIARE(to re-hand-le)In English, rules like composition or cliticization are not strictlymorphologlc, because they often involve more than a word.
InItalian, on the contrary, they modify the single word, producing newwords like, for instance:- - ->  a l te ra t ion  - - ->  CART-ACCIA(waste paper)CARTA ---> composition ---> CARTA-MONETA(paper) (paper money)---> cliticization ---> IN-CART-ARE(to wrap in paper)These rules make the set of Italian words potentially unlimiled,and sometimes make insufficient even a common dictionary.A different approach takes two different lists: one containing thelemmata of the language and the other the logic rules of derivations,from which all the correct Italian words can be produced startingfrom the lemmata.These rules can be easily described by means of a context-freegrammar, in which every "word" results from the concatenation ofthe "stem" of a lemma with alterations, affixes, endings and enelities.This grammar can both generate from a given lemma all thecurrent Italian words deriving from it and analyze a given word bygiving all the possible lemmata it derives from.The backtracking mechanism of Prolog directly allows to obtainall the solutions.This morphologic analyzer can also provide further informationabout some linguistic peculiarities, like, for instance:compound namesmodal verbsaltered namespelle-rossa (red-skin), which has as pluralpeUi-rosse.which take another verb as object (1 cango)foglia (leaf) can be altered in fogli-olina(leaf-let), whose meaning is piccola foglia(small leaf).Data structureA correct morphologie analysis requires not only knowledgc onthe language lemmata, but also on the word components asalterations, affixes, endings and enclitics.
This information might hcrepresented in form of Prolog facts.
In this way, data mighl bedirectly accessed by the program, because the homogeneity of theirstructure.
The disadvantage is a performance degradation when thesize of data increases, since Prolog is not provided with efficientsearch algorithms.Hence it seemed convenient to draw a distinction between data:on one hand the set of lemmata, and on the other the sets of affixes,alterations, endings and enclitics.
The former (which is the mostrelevant and needs to be continuously updated), has been struclurcdas a relational data base table, managed by the SQI,/DS.
Theadvantage is that this system is directly accessible from VM/Prolog(the string containing the query is processed by SQI., which returnsthe answer as a Prolog list).
The latter (which have fixed lenghl andare not so large), have been stored in the Prolog workspace i, f ,  rmof Prolog facts.The set of lemmata is a table with five attributes:1. the fu'st is the lemma.2.
the second is the stem (the invariable part of the lemma): this isthe access key in the table.3.
the third is the name of the "class of endings" associated withevery lemma.
A class of endings is the set of all the endingsrelated to a given class of words.
For example, each of theregular verbs of the first conjugation has the same endings; hencethere exists a class named dv_leonjug containing all and onlythese endings.
Generally each irregular verb is related to differentclasses of endings: andare (to go), for example, admits twodifferent stems, vad (go) and and (went); so there exist twosubclasses of endings named respectively dvl andare anddr2 andare.4.
the fourth attribute is the syntactic ategory of the lemma: Iorexample, the information that to have is an auxiliary transitiveverb.5.
the fifth is an integer identifying the type of analysis Iobcperformed:I the analysis can be performed completely2 the lemma can neither be altered nor affixed (this isthe case for example of prepositions andconjunctions)3 only the longest analysis of the lemma is considered(this is the case of the false alterated nouns:mattino (morning) is not a little matto (mad), suchas in english outlet is not a little out!

andar?
v.intran.simple IThe other sets of data are contained in the Prolog workspace andare structured as tables of a relational data base.The set of the classes of endings is a table with three attributes:l .2.3.the first is the name of the class and it is the access key in thetable.the second is one of the endings belonging to the classthe third is the morphologic ategory associated with the ending:for example, the class dn..oggetto contains the two endings whichare used in order to inlleet al the masculine nouns behaving likethe word oggetto (object): o for the singular (oggett-o), and i forthe plural (oggett-O.eading..da~ ending morph_categdn_oggctto o mas.sing.dn_oggetto i mas.phir.The affixes can be divided in la'eflxcs preceding the stem of thelemma, and suffixes following the stem of the lemma.The prefixes are simply listed by means of a one attribute table.In this way it is not necessary to list the prefixed words in thelexicon: they are obtained by chaining the prefix with the originalword.
For example, from the verb to handle with the prefix re weobtain the verb to rehandle.
Morphologlc and syntacticcharacteristics remain the same; for the verbs only, the prefixed verbdiffers sometimes from the previous one in the syntactic atlribules(transitive/intransitive, simple/modal).The set of suffixes is a table with four attributes:I.2.3.4.the first is the suffix itselfthe second is the stem of the suffix (the access key to the table)the third is the ending class of the suffixthe fourth is the syntactic lass of the suffix.
Suffixcs, in fact,differently from prefixes, changes both morphologic and syntacticcharacteristics of the original word: they change verbs into namesor adjectives (deverba/suff'oces), names into verbs or adjectives(denominal suffixes), adjectives into verbs or names (deadje:tivalsuffixes).
The first attribute is chained to the stem of the originallemma in order to obtain the derived lemma: for example, fromthe stem of the lemrna mattino (morning), which is a noun, withthe suffix iero, we obtain the new lemma mattin-iero (earlyrising), which is an adjective, and from the second stem of thelemma andare (to go), which is a verb, with the suffix amento,we obtain the new lemma and-amento (walking), which is anoun.suffixieroamentostem !
endingdamier da belloament I dn_oggettosynt_catcgadj.qualific.noun.commonThe set of alteration is a table with three attributes:1. the first is the stem of the alteration (the access key in the tablc l2.
the second is the ending class of the alteration3.
the third is the semantic type of the alteration.
Alterationschange the morphologic and semantic characteristics of thealtered word, but not its syntactic athegory: for example, thelemma easa (house) can be altered in casina (little house),easona (big house), easaeeia (ugly house), and so on:stem endinLda.~ seman categin da belle diminutiveon dn_cosa augmentativeacc da_~bio  pejorativeThe cnclitics are pronouns linked to the ending of a verb: forexample va li" (go there) can be expressed also in the form vaeei (ci isthe ?nclitic, the c is duplicated according with a phonetic rule).The set of the enclitics is a table with two attributes: the first isthe maclitic (this is the access key to the table) and the second is themorphologlc haracteristic of the encfitic.
The analy-zer divides theverb from the enclitic, so that it becomes a different word, taking themorphologlc characteristic stated in the table and the syntacticcategory of pronoun.Other two sets of data have been defined in order to handle fixedsequences of words, such as proper names and idioms.The set of the most common italian idioms has been structuredas a table with two attributes: the first one is the idiom itself, whilethe second is the syntactic ategory of the idiom.
In this way it ispossible to recognize the idiom without performing the analysis ofeach of the component words.
For example, di mode che (in such away as) is an idiom used in the role of a conjunction, and a mane amatzo (little by little) is used in the role of an adverb.The set of proper names belonging to the context of Economicsand Finance is a table with three attributes: the first is the propername, the second its syntactic ategory and the third its moq~hologiccategory.proper  n~llrlelunedi' (monday)synt_categ morph_catcgmas.sing.

To analyze this sequence of words it is not necessary toknow that in is a preposition, such is an adjective, a an article, and soon: the only useful information is that this sequence takes the role ofconjunction.
Other fixed sequences of words are proper names: it isnecessary to know, for example, that Montepolimeri Montedi.wn orVittorio Ripa di Meana are single entities.Idioms and proper names are recognized by means of a patternmatching algorithm: the comparison is made between the lll|,tllsentence and the first attribute of the tables of idioms and propernames.
When the comparison fails, backtracking evaluates anotherhypothesis.
Every recogniz~ed sequence of words is written on anappropriate fde and then removed from the input sentence.Date expressions, as lunedi' 13 agosto (monday, august tile /3rd),arc considered as single entities, in order to simplify the work ofsyntax.
They are recognized by means of a context-free grammar,34whose axiom is the "date':I DATE --> <name_proper_wday> <DAI>2 DATE --> <DAI>3 DATE --> <DA2>4 DAI --> <number(<31)> <nameproper_month>5 DAI --> <number(<31)> <DA2>6 DA2 --> <nameproper_month> <number>Figure I.
The grammar for the DATENumbers are recognized by the library function numb(*) and bymeans of a context-free grammar translating strings into numbers.
Inthis way it is possible to evaluate in the same way expressions suchas 1352 and milletreeentoeinquantadue (one thousand three hundredand fifty two).i NUMBER --> <NUMI>2 NUMBER --> <'mille'>3 NUHBER --> <'mille'> <NUHI>4 NUMBER --> <NUHI> <'mlla'>5 NUMBER --> <NUHI> <'mila'> <NUHI>6 WdH1 - -><NUH2>7 NUH1 - -><NL~3>8 ICu~ll - -> <NUH4>9 NUH2 - -> <uni ts> <NUH3>I0 NUH3 --> <'cento'>11 NUM3 --> <'cento'> <NUM4>12 NUM4 --> <units>13 NUH4 --> <tens>14 NUH4 --> <tens> <units>Figure 2.
The grammar for the NUMBERThe morphologic analyzerThis is the main module of the whole system.
Its task is toanalyse ach element (word) of the list received from the preanalyserand to produce for every form analyzed the list of all itscharacteristics:I. the lemma it derives from2.
its syntactic haracteristics3.
its morphoiogic characteristics (none for invariable words)4. the list of alterations (possibly empty)5. the list of enclitics (possibly empty).For example the form sono (the ist sing.
and the 3rd plur.

This is preceded by one ormore prefixes, and followed by one or more suffixes and alterati,,ns,by an ending and, as far as the verbs are concerned, by one or moreenclitics.This structure has been described by means of a context-freegrammar in which the "word" is the axiom and all its comlxmcntsthe endings.1 WORD --> {prefix'} n <stem> <REM>2 REM --> {suffix)'* {alteration}  <TALL>3 REM --> <ending> {suffix}" {alteration}" <TAl l .>4 TAIL --> <ending> {enclitic} nFigure 3.

The rules for the plural of Compound NounsSome examples of compound nouns are:singular pluralpassa-porto (pass-port) passa-portiporta-cenere (ash-tray) porta-cenerecava-tappi (cork-screw) cava-tappirule1234567sali-seendi (door-late~t) sali-mendibanco-nota (bank-note) banco-notcbasso-rilievo (bas-relieJ) basso-rilievicassa-forte (steel-safe) casse-fortiThe task of this part of the morphology is to:reeoguize all the "well-formed" words of Italian language.The analyzer parses the words from left to right, splitting theminto elementary parts: prefix(es), the stem(s) of the appropriatelemma(ta) of derivation (retrieved from a restricted dictionaryreporting only the "elementary lemmata') suffix(es), alteration(s),ending(s), enclitic(s).
Each hypothesis is checked by verifyingthat all the conditions for a right composition of those parts aresatisfied.2.
submit every word not recognized to the user, who can statewether:?
the word is really wrong, because of- an orthographic error: for example squola instead of scuola(school).- a composition error: for example serviziazione is wrong as'iazione' is a deverbal suffix and 'serviz" is the stem of thenoun 'servizio' (service) and the corresponding verb does notexist.a the word derives from a lemma which is not reported in thelexicon.
In this case the user can recall a graphic interface,allowing him/her to update directly the lexicon.3.
perform, if requested by the user, an inspection in the list of the"currently used" words.
In this way, for example, the user knowsthat coton-~eio (cotton-mill) and coton-iera re two well-formedItalian words, but that only the first one is commonly used.The morphosyntactic analyzerThe aim of the morphosyntactic analyzer is to perform theanalysis of the contiguous words in the sentence, in order torecognize regular structures uch as compound tenses of verbs andcomparative and superlative forms of adjectives.Compound tenses of verbs are described by means of a regulargrammar, whose rules are applied any time the analyzer finds in thesentence the past participle of the verb.
These rules arc:I C0MP:ZNSZ2 COMP TENSE3 REM4 REM5 REM--> <v.tran.aux.><v.
tran.(past.part.

The grammar for the COMPOUND TENSEs of verbsWhen a rule is successfully applied the morphologic ategories ofthe verbs are changed and the attribute 'active'/'passive' can bcspecified correctly.
For example, after the morphosyntactic analysis.the phrase io suno chiamato (I'm called)( ( io .

The form is passive, as "chiamare" (to call) is atransitive verb (the auxiliary verb for the active form is to have).
In36this case morphosyntactic analysis has solved an ambiguity: only aninterpretation will be analyzed by syntax.The following figure shows the task of the grammar, applied anytime the parser finds the past participle of a verb in the sentence.?
If the verb is transitive the parser looks at the word BF.FOREthe verb:- if the word is a tense of the verb to be, the resulting verb isSIMPLE PASSIVE (the rules applied are the 2nd and the4th);- if the word is a tense of the verb to have, the resulting verb isCOMPOUND ACTIVE (the rule applied is the lst).u If the verb is intransitive the parser looks at the word AF'I'FRthe verb:- if it is the past participle of another verb the resulting vcrh isCOMPOUND PASSIVE (the rules appfied are the 2nd andthe 3rd);- otherwise it is COMPOUND ACTIVE (the rules applied arcthe 2nd and the 5th).pIIIT IMATImlq8 li ' - -  i I " -  i2,4  1 2.3 2.8Figure 9.
Compound tenses of verbsThe grammar for the comparative and supcrlativc forms ofadjectives is applied any time the analyzer finds thc words piu'(more), meno (less) followed by a qualificative adjective.
In this wayit is possible to recognize and to distinguish expressions like piu'interessante (more interesting) and il pin' interessante (the mostinteresting).
Remark that in English there is the use of more, most tomake cleat the distinction between the comparativc and thesuperlative form of the adjective.1 SUPERL REL --> <art.determ.> <COMPARATIVE>2 C0MPAI~TIVE --> <'piu"> <adj.qualific.>3 COHPARATIVE --> <'meno'> <adj.quallflc.>Figure 10.
The grammar for the SUPERLATIVE and COMPARATIVEform of adjectivesIn the same manner it is possible to recognize mixed numericexpressions like three billions 564 millions 234000 and to cwduatethcrn into their equivalent numeric form (3564234000).

The grammar for COMPOUND NUMBERsConc lus ionsThis approach presents the advantage of a higher flexibilily in theanalysis of words.
Moreover such a method has requested a stronginitial effort in the formalization of the rules (with all theirexceptions) for the morphologic treatment of words, but has largelysimplified the work of classification of every Italian word.The lexicon stores about 7000 elementary lemmata, derived froma list of about 20000 different Italian forms.
They correspond toabout 15000 ordinary lemmata (entries of a common dictionary).References\[1\] Graphical Data Display Manager, Application ProgrammingGuide, SC33-0148-2, IBM Corp., 1984.\[2\] SQL/Data System, Terminal User's Reference, SII24-5fU7-2,IBM Corp., 1983.\[3\] VM/Programming in Logic, Program Description/OperationManual, SH20-6541-0, IBM Corp., 1985.\[4\] M.Alinei, La struttura del lessico, ed.
