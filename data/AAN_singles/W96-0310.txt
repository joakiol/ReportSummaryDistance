eduAbstract.
This work belongs to a family of research efforts, called microtheories andaimed at describing the static meaning of all lexical categories in several languages in theframework of the MikroKosmos project on computational semantics.
The latter also in-volves other static microtheories describing world knowledge and syntax-semantics map-ping as well as dynamic microtheories connected with the actual process of text analysis.This paper deals with the microtheory of adjectival semantics in one specific aspect,namely, the optimization and facilitation of the lexical entries for deverbal adjectives withthe help:of lexical rules deriving such entries from those of the corresponding verbs.
De-verbal adjectives turn out to be the largest single subclass in the adjective l xical category.Unlike scalar and relative adjectives, which are anchored in property and object concepts,respectively, in the underlying ontology, deverbal adjectives are based on process con-cepts.
While acquisition with lexical rules is necessary, universal and efficient for the classof deverbal adjectives, our research shows that, often in spite of the strong appearance tothe contrary, such acquisition isneither fully automatic nor cost-free.
The work was basedon the set of over 6,000 English and about 1,500 Spanish adjectives obtained from task-oriented corpora.
The findings are largely language-independent, and only English exam-ples are Used throughout the paper.1.
IntroductionThe general toPic of this paper is the information about adjectival meaning which should be includ-ed in a computational lexicon.
Having addressed this general topic elsewhere (Raskin and Niren-burg 1995), we focus here on a more specific topic of the meaning of deverbal adjectives and, evenmore specifically, on the lexical rules used to derive the meanings of such adjectives from those ofthe corresponding verbs.An extensive literature review in Raskin and Nirenburg (1995: 3-20) has demonstrated a focus ona number of issues that the non-computational linguistics of adjectives has deemed important.These include adjective taxonomies, usually on the basis of more or less consistent external crite-ria, the dichotomy between predicating and non-predicating adjectives and the related ichotomybetween qualitative and relative adjectives, the order of adjectives modifying the same noun, thedegrees of comparison and scalability, and the substantivization f adjectives.We have shown also (Raskin and Nirenburg 1995: 24-27) that computational lexicography andcomputational semantics impose totally different parameters of relevance on these issues.
We dis-covered that developing adjective semantics for an application modifies many popular views onthe subject.
It becomes clear, for instance, that?
many adjectives do not modify semantically the nouns that they modify syntactically;?
adjectival (attributive) meanings may be delivered by other parts of speech, and thus the se-1 Also of Natural Language Processing Laboratory, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907.89mantics of adjectives only partially reflects their possible syntactic distinctions;?
the major distinction among adjectives i scalar vs. non-scalar;?
the attributive/predicative distinction, dominating the current scholarship on the adjective,has virtually no semantic significance, thus essentially crushing any hope to derive mean-ing from deep syntactic analysis;?
there is a significant gap in our knowledge about relations between truly relative adjectives(as well as nominal modifiers in English) and the nouns they modify;?
the typology of scales for gradables emerges as the dominant issue in adjective semanticsand lexicography.Most importantly for this paper, the crucial taxonomic riterion for each adjective is its anchoringin the underlying ontology.
Whether such an anchor is a property, object, or process concept de-fines the adjective as truly scalar, relative (denominal), or deverbal, respectively.The existing literature on adjectives also shows a predictable scarcity of systematic semantic anal-yses or lexicographic descriptions of adjectives.
The quantifier adjectives, being the closest naturallanguage comes to formal ogic, have been privileged in this respect--see, for instance, Jackendoff(1983), McCawley (1988: 594-630), Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet (1990: 406-430), Frawley(1992: 464-480).
The second luckiest category is adjectives of measure, especially spatial and, toa lesser degree, temporal, which are also seen as being more logically structured (see Bierwisch1967, 1989, Greimas 1966, Teller 1969, Zhurinskiy 1971, Dowty 1972, Siegel 1976:107-149 and1979, Spang-Hanssen 1990, Spejewski 1995, and others).Obviously, the semantic analysis of adjectives hares many problems with the semantic analysisof anything in natural language.
One specific problem, noted by very few scholars, is what Marx(1983--see also Marx 1977 and Szalay and Deese 1978) refers to as the "plasticity" of adjectivalmeaning, namely that the same adjective can emphasize a different property of a noun in a differentcontext.
Lahav (1989), working loosely in the Keenan and Faltz (1985) paradigm, presents thesame property as the non-compositionality of adjectives.
If, he argues, red birds, red houses, andred books mean all different kinds of redness--and they do--how can one derive the meaning of anAdj N combination from the meaning of the adjective and the noun?
In other words, each noun, hebelieves, influences the meaning of the adjective.
Katz (1972: 752), analyzing the meaning ofgood, is virtually the only author to have come up with a specific, even if definitely not completeaccount of how this works.
Certain classes of nouns, he asserts, offer specific properties for goodto work on:"It\]he respects inwhich evaluations of things c,,an be made differ with differences in the other semanticfeatures of the words that refer to those things.'
(Artifact) permits evaluation ofuses; (Component ofasystem) functions; (Role) duties; (OrnamentaUon) purposes; (Food) pleasurability and healthfulness; thereare many others.
"This situation, in which semantic analyses and lexicographic descriptions of adjectives (and othercategories) are rare, is bound to change rapidly.
As computational semantics moves to large-scalesystems erving non-toy domains, the need for large lexicons with entries of all lexical categoriesin them is becoming increasingly acute, and the attention of computational semanticists and lexi-cographers i turning more towards uch previously neglected or avoided categories as the adjec-tives.
Recently, there have appeared some first indications of this attention--see, for instance,Smadja (1991), Beckwith et al (1991), Bouillon and Viegas (1994), Justeson and Katz (1991,1995), Pustejovsky (1995: 20-23).
This research is a step in the same direction.902.
The Ontology-Based Approach to Adjectival Semantics and LexicologyIn this section, we briefly review the basis of our approach to adjectival meaning and illustrate iton three examples of adjectival lexicon entries, i.e., one each for the three major classes of adjec-tives.2.1 The Ontological ApproachOur work on adjectives forms a microtheory used by the MikroKosmos emantic analyzer.
The ar-chitecture of MikroKosmos is described in Onyshkevych and Nirenburg 1994 and Beale et al1995.
The MikroKosmos project is a component ofa knowledge-based machine translation system(see Nirenburg et al 1992).
The purpose and result of the MikroKosmos analysis process is a ren-dering of the source language text into an interlingua text.
The interlingua l nguage is called the"text meaning representation" (TMR) language, and the TMR of a text is its representation in thisparticular type of interlingua.
TMRs are realized in a frame-based language, where frame namestypically refer to instances of ontological concepts and slots are usually filled with values of prop-erties of those concepts.
An ontology is, thus, a necessary prerequisite for building a TMR lan-guage.
"An ontology for NLP purposes i  a body of knowledge about he world (or a domain) that a) is arepository of primitive symbols used in meaning representation; b) organizes these symbols in atangled subsumption hierarchy; and c) further interconnects these symbols using a rich system ofsemantic and discourse-pragmatic relations defined among the concepts" (Mahesh and Nirenburg1995: 1).
The function of the ontology is to supply "world knowledge to lexical, syntactic, and se-mantic processes" (ibid).The lexicon in MikroKosmos "mediates between the TMR and ontology" (Onyshkevych andNirenburg 1994: 2).
Lexicon entries for most open-class lexical items represent word and phrasesenses, which can be either directly mapped into ontological concepts or derived by locally (thatis, in the lexicon entry itself) modifying constraints on property values of concepts used to specifythe meaning of the given lexical item.
In the following section, we briefly illustrate the structureof those parts of the lexicon entry in MikroKosmos which bear on the description of the three typesof adjectival meaning, scalar, denominal, and deverbal.2.2 The Ontological Approach to the Meaning of Adjective Types2.2.1 Scalar AdjectivesOur microtheory associates the meaning of a typical truly scalar adjective with a region on a scalewhich is defined as the range of an ontological property.
The contribution that the adjective makesto the construction of a semantic dependency structure (TMR) typically consists of inserting itsmeaning (a property-value pair) as a slot in a frame representing the meaning of the noun whichthis adjective syntactically modifies.Thus, in big house, big will assign a high value as the filler of the property slot SIZE of the framefor the meaning of house (see also Raskin and Nirenburg 1996).
(1) is a partial lexical entry for big,with just two of the 13 lexical zones represented:(1) (big(big-Adj ~CAT adj)91(SYN-STRUC(1 ((root Svarl)(cat n)(mods ((root $var0)))))(2 ((root $var0)(cat adj)(subj ((root $varl)(cat n))))))(SEM-STRUC(LEX-MAP((1 2) (size-attribute(domain (value ^ $varl)(sem physical-object))(range (value (> 0.75))(relaxable-to (value (> 0.6))))))))))SIZE is an ontological concept of  the SCALAR-PHYSICAL-OBJECT-A'FrRIBUTE-PROPERTY type, withthe term 'scalar' used here, as it is customari ly, primari ly in the sense of 'gradable.'
Big  is, ofcourse, a typical gradable adjective, and as such, has a numerical  scale associated with it the mi-crotheory.
Each numerical scale can be measured in actual measuring units, such as linear-size infeet, yards, or mil l imeters, or t ime in seconds.
But often natural anguage xpressions do not referto absolute magnitudes but rather to abstract relative ones, as in the case of b ig .
We assume a 0 to1 numerical range for such abstract scales.
For abstract references to size, the fillers in Engl ish canbe:(2)0y  y 1Big  will, then, get something like a '> 0.75' value on the SIZE scale (1).
These values are a crucialpart of  the lexical mapping (LEX-MAP) included in the semantics (SEM-STRUC) "zone" of  a scalar-adjective lexical entry.
2.Equally crucial is the syntactic-semantic mapping between the syntactic-structure (SYN-STRUC)and SEM-STRUC zones with the help of special variables.
In the former, there are two subcategori-zation patterns, marked 1 and 2, l isted in SYN-STRUC of (1).
The former pattern corresponds to theattributive use of  the adjective: the noun it modif ies is assigned the variable $var l ,  and the adjec-tive itself the variable $var0 in the modif ier  position.
The latter pattern presents the noun, boundto $varl ,  in the subject posit ion and the adjective in the predicative position.
In the SEM-STRUCzone, instead of variables which are bound to syntactic elements, the meanings of  the elements re-2 Similar values are assigned to any scale based on a property concept.
It should be noted, however, that nu-merical values like these correspond tothe feature of gradability, which extends beyond scalarity: all scalaradjectives are gradable but not all gradable adjectives are true scalars.
The two features are typically con-fused in the literature.
This is why we distinguish ere between true scalars, i.e., those adjectives whosemeanings are based on a scale that is a property concept in the ontology, and all the other adjectives whichare gradable and may be also loosely referred to as "scalars."
Thus, many denominal nd deverbal adjectives,in fact, most adjectives, can form a comparative or superlative degree form with the help of more __  ormost  .
.
.
.
respectively, e.g., more medica l  (3ii), more aeronaut ica l  (4), more employable  (6), more abusive(9-10).
All of these adjectives are, therefore, gradable.
Now, none of them is anchored in a scale-type proper-ty concept, however, which makes them all, technically, non-scalars but, in more practical and customaryterms, non-true scalars.92ferred to by these variables (and marked by a caret, '^') are used.
That is, ^ $varl reads as "themeaning of the element to which the variable $varl is bound."
Among the constraints listed in theSEM-STRUC zone of an entry, are selectional restrictions (the noun must be a physical object) andrelaxation information, which is used for treatment of unexpected ("ill-formed") input during pro-cessing.Thus, an entry like (1) should be read as follows:?
first, the entry is the specification of a single sense, while the superentry is the set of such en-tries;?
the second line assigns a sense number to the entry;?
next, the adjective is assigned to its lexical category;?
the first subcategorization pattern in the SYN-STRUC zone describes the Adj-N construction;the second subcategorization pattern describes the N-Copula-Adj construction;?
the LEX-MAP part of the SEM-STRUC zone defines the lexical semantics of the adjective by as-signing it to the class of SIZE adjectives, that is, anchoring it in the ontological property-type concept SEE and stating that it is applicable to physical objects and that its meaning isa high-value range on the SIZE scale/property.In the case of continuous scales, like SIZE, the acquisition of all the adjectives served by this scaleis greatly facilitated and expedited after the first one of them gets a lexical entry: each new adjec-tive needs only an appropriate range assigned to it, and the rest of the information in the semanticzone of the entry, as indeed in all the other zones as well, remains the same.
We will recall thismethodological circumstance shortly, in Section 3.2.2.2 Denominai AdjectivesThe most general case of a denominal adjective-entry and its connection to that of the corre-sponding noun is demonstrated in (3):(3) (i) (medicine(medicine-N1)(CAT n)(SYN-STRUC(root Svar0)(cat n)))(SEM-STRUC(LEX-MAPmedicine))))(ii) (medical(medical-Adj)(CAT adj)(SYN-STRUC(1 ((root $varl)(cat n)(mods ((root $var0)))))(2 ((root $var0)(cat adj)(subj ((root $varl)(cat n))))))(SEM-STRUC(LEX-MAP(^$varl(pertain-to medicine))))))The formula of transition from the noun entry to that of the adjective is simple and transparent,and it remains constant for this type of adjective.
In Raskin and Nirenburg (1995: 39-41), we dis-cuss the desirability, feasibility, and usefulness of replacing the catch-all "pertain-to" dependency93with a more specific and informative one, and while we demonstrate s veral of those, we argue forstaying at this generic level of granularity in a significant number of cases.Denominal adjectives are relative, and, as such, are expected to be non-scalar and non-predicating.A true relative adjective cannot indeed be used predicatively and or comparatively, but, practically,it is hard to come up with an example which is guaranteed against that.
After all, (4i-ii) are not re-ally ill-formed, and it is hard to imagine a more truly-relative adjective than aeronautical 'relatedto aeronautics.
'(4) (i)(ii)His approach to the problem was aeronautical.His approach to the problem was much more aeronautical than mine.Clearly, a productive semantic process, a shift, takes place here, probably along the lines of (5),and, therefore, a dynamic rule exists which creates adjective ntries for these predicating, pseudo-scalar, pseudo-qualitative senses of the seemingly perfectly relative adjectives.
Their one tellingdifference from the truly qualitative, predicating, scalar adjectives is that the relative adjectivescannot make the qualitative shift in the attributive position.
(5) Pertaining to \[noun meaning\] --->Pertaining more to \[noun meaning\]The difficulty of finding a relative adjective which would be absolutely resistant to a predicativeshift of meaning is similar to the difficulties Katz (1972: 753) had, looking for a noun which couldnever be used with good.2.2.3 Deverbal Adjectives: First GlimpseA large class of adjectives whose meanings are derived from those of verbs also straddle the scalar/ non-scalar divide.
The event-related scalars (actually, gradables--see fn.
2) do not really differfrom true scalars in terms of their gradability (6); the event-related non-scalars can acquire grad-ability at the cost of a meaning shift or marginal acceptability (7).

Both the verb entry and the adjective ntries are much more complex thanthose for nouns and denominal entries.

Attitudel means that the beneficiary or.
more appropriately, thevictim, of the process, i.e., the abused person and/or the speaker evaluate(s) the theme of the abuse,i.e., the contents of what is said, as bad; attitude2 means that the agent of abuse-V1 thinks of thebeneficiary pretty poorly.To derive the semantics zone of an adjectival entry from that of the corresponding verbal entry,one must first identify the case, or thematic role (such as agent, theme, beneficiary, etc.)
filled bythe noun modified by the adjective in question.
What is abusive is either the event (E) itself, as inabusive speech or abusive behavior, or the agent (A) of the event, as in abusive man or abusiveneighbor.
AbusivelE (9) is then the eventive sense of the adjective formed from abuse-V1 (8), andabusive lA (10) is the agentive sense of the adjective in the same sense of abuse.
There may, in fact,be at least 4 more senses, and entries, for the adjective, but we will come back to them shortly, inSection 4.1.3.
Lexical RulesIn this section, we introduce our notion of lexical rules (LRs), place their origin in the descriptivemethodology and heuristics of large-scale l xical acquisition, and establish some usability param-eters for them.The "transition formulae" from a noun lexical entry (3i) to that of a denominal adjective (3ii) orfrom a verb lexical entry (8) to those of deverbal adjectives (9-10) are examples of LRs in whichwe are interested here.
Each LR takes a ready entry (El) and creates another entry (E2) out of itautomatically:(11) LR (El) = E 2Typically, each E 1 is produced "manually," that is, by a qualified human on the basis of all theavailable heuristics for the lexical acquisition process (see Raskin andNirenburg 1995: 41-57).These include methods of reducing unnecessary polysemy, gauging the optimal grain size, and de-termining the meaning, not the least of which is selecting the ontological concept in which the entryis anchored.
These methods are, of course, captured in an array of semi-automatic ools of onto-logical and lexical acquisition developed for the MikroKosmos project (see, for instance, Mahesh1996 and Viegas and Raskin 1996).These tools stemmed from a pilot project, in which templates for types of lexical entries were de-96veloped truly manually and rapidly propagated on the basis of such obvious paradigmatic relationsas synonymy and partial synonymy, antonymy, and hyper-/hyponymy, and much less obvious re-lations of partial overlap, such as exemplified above in connection with the lexical entry for big (1)and its easy adaptation toall the other SIZE adjectives by modifying the numerical value on the SIZErange (2), if necessary.
The corpus of 6,000 English adjectives (an intersection of LDOCE and acorpus of 1987-99 Wall Street Journal articles) yielded some 250 S/ZE adjectives, all of them prop-agated from the same template that underlies (1).
The least rivial relationship to establish involvedconstrains on the modified noun, thus recognizing an adjective like well-endowed ascharacterizingthe size of a certain part of human male anatomy, a different part of human female anatomy, or theamount of money available to an institution.The discovery and use of such relationships and rapid propagation methods based on them lay thefoundation for LRs.
In fact, each such relationship and related method is a LR.
Because we are en-gaged in massive lexical acquisition, we are obviously interested in LRs, which are:?
easily discoverable;?
massively productive;?
exception-free.Perhaps the most easily discoverable LRs involve E l/E2 pairs which are morphologically related,especially if their share the roots.
Some of these rules are transcategorial, i.e., E 1 and E2 belong todifferent lexical categories.
Obviously, the denominal adjective LR and the deverbal adjective LR(12i-ii, respectively), exemplified in (3) and (8-10), are precisely such LRs.
(12) (i)ii)LRNA (N entry) = Adj entryLRvA (V entry) = Adj entryThe additional attraction for using (12i-ii) in massive acquisition is the facilitation of the least riv-ial element of lexical semantic heuristics, namely, the discovery of the ontological concept onwhich the lexical entry should be based.
While a relatively small class of true scalars is more orless easily associated with certain property concepts, there are many more process and object con-cepts, and it is much easier to relate the meaning of a verb or a noun to one of those.
Besides, it isprecisely the denominal and deverbal adjectives which are very hard to relate to a property conceptdirectly, so the LRs come in quite handy.Several of the LRs discovered manually in the pilot project urned out to be "large," in the senseof their massive productiveness (see, for instance, Viegas et al 1996), such as the comparative-degree LR, applicable to every one of the 4,000-plus gradable adjectives.
Given the paucity of rel-ative adjectives:in English (because of the adjectival use of nouns), the denominal adjective LR(12i) produces around 300 entries in our English corpus.
The deverbal adjective LR falls in be-tween, with an output of almost 1,000 entries.We have foundlvirtually no LR to be exception-free, and that reduces, of course, the degree towhich a large LR can be used fully automatically, thus raising the cost of their application.4.
Deverbal Adjectives: A Full(er) ViewIn this section, we offer a bird's eye view of large-scale acquisition of deverbal adjectives with thehelp of LRvA, both in the general, common case, with its non-trivial complications, deviations, andexceptions, and in the particular case of the single largest and seemingly most regular subclass of97deverbal adjectives, namely, those ending in -able/-ible.
The review is conducted from the perspec-tive of highly desirable full automation vs. the reality and unavoidability of exceptions requiringmanual treatment.4.1 LRvA: Common Cases and ComplicationsThe common case of deverbal adjective acquisition includes most deverbal adjectives, and it is dis-cussed first.
The most statistically and conceptually significant complications, deviations, and ex-ceptions from the common case are briefly sketched next.4.1.1 Common CaseThe 950 or so deverbal adjectives in our English corpus have received their entries as a result ofthe application of the deverbal adjective LR (12ii).
The LR exists in at least these 6 forms, corre-sponding to the event or its semantic ases/thematic roles:?
event-itself (E), e.g., abusive in (9): abusive behavior;?
agent-of-event (A), e.g., abusive in (10): abusive husband;?
beneficiary-of-event (B), e.g.,free in free bird;?
theme-of-event (T), e.g., automatic in automatic elevator;?
instrument-of-event (I), e.g., poisonous in poisonous food;?
location-of-event (L), e.g., international in international company.As exemplified in (9-10), each case-related sub-LR operates in a well-defined way, placing ^ $varlin the SEM-STRUC zone in the value slot of the appropriate case of the event frame.
Similarly, LR E,the event-itself sub-LR places ^ $varl in the event position.
Obviously, then:(13) (i)(ii)LR E (abuse-V1) = abusive-lE (9)LR A (abuse-V1) = abusive-lA (10)Abuse has two more senses, abuse-V2 "violate a law or a privilege" and abuse-V3 "assault physi-cally."
Abusive can inherit all of those senses, both in the eventive and agentive varieties, thus add-ing 4 more senses to its superentry.
Abusive is indeed a pretty typical and "easy" example of LRvA.Even so, there are several aspects of its application which require human judgment.4.1.2 Selective Semantic CasesThe first obvious complication is that not all of its semantic ases of a verb are usable for the LR--in fact, only one of the three semantic ases of abuse, namely, agent is but beneficiary and themeare not.
This throws the first monkey's wrench into making the LR fully automatic.
Here, as inmany similar cases in side and outside of this LR, we face a dilemma.
We can either try and dis-cover a rule which marks some semantic ases as participating in the LR and others as not partic-ipating in it.
Such a principle is not immediately clear and may:?
not exist at all;?
be very hard to research;?
be cumbersome and involve a complicated procedure;?
be exception-ridden, thus coming with a possibly lengthy list or several different lists;?
be not machine-tractable.The other alternative is to check each verb manually, i.e., by a qualified human.
We will see that98there are other factors which push this latter decision forward.4.1.3 Selective Meanings in Polysemous VerbsIt is interesting to note that the sense distinctions in abusive seem to be less significant than inabuse.
Typical of many cases of polysemy, this may be an indication that the distinctions in thedictionaries may be disposable (see the Spanish verb dejar reduced from 52 dictionary meaningsto 7 in Nirenburg et al 1995).
Perhaps less so in the case of abuse than in the case of abandon di-rectly below, it is reasonable to suggest that, in many cases of dictionary polysemy, it is the singlesense of the verb modified by different ypes of nouns that can fill its case slots.
Such cases arecandidates for reducing polysemy as part of the heuristics procedures mentioned above (see alsoRaskin and Nirenburg 1995: 41-45).A human must decide whether the adjective inherits all the senses of a polysemous verb because itis not always the case that it does--unlike abusive.
Thus, impregnable has only the figurative senseof impregnate, Out of the 5 senses of abandon:?
abandon-V1: "stop trying" (aspectual);?
abandon-V2: "leave somebody or something at location";?
abandon, V3: "withdraw support";?
abandon-V4: "give up claim";?
abandon-V5: "yield to emotion"--abandoned has 6 senses corresponding tojust three of the senses (some examples below may haveother meanings along with the one exemplified):I?
abandoned-2B, e.g., abandoned friend;?
abandoned-2T, e.g., abandonedparcel;?
abandoned-3B, e.g., abandonedprotdg~;?
abandoned-3T, e.g., abandonedproject;?
abandoned-4B, e.g., abandoned child;?
abandoned-4T, e.g., abandonedproperty--and 1, possibly no longer existing sense corresponding toanother sense of the verb:?
abandoned-5T, e.g., John was abandoned to his grief (theme is used here in the experiencermode).4.1.4 Adjectives and ParticiplesAbandoned can, of course, be a participle as well, but we have discovered no reason whatsoever totreat participles differently from deverbal adjectives.
Surely, participles may have syntactic depen-dents and be used postpositively in English--more so than adjectives, but this is easily accountedfor in the appropriate patterns (not demonstrated) in the adjective SYN-STRUC zone.
An adjective,just as a participle, is a device to raise a proposition into a higher one.
In fact, we suggest that allclearly participial adjectives must be treated exactly as we are proposing here, that is, with the helpof LRvA: the only alternative isunfolding them into full-fledged clauses, and this is something MTshould, and usually can, avoid dealing with--on the basis of the practical effability principle (Niren-burg and Raskin 1995: 45-47).
That the difference between participles and adjectives may be agrammatical rtifact--or that, at least, it is of no significance for computational semantics--can beindirectly but rather convincingly supported by the case of Russian, where the grammarians havebeen trying to prop up the distinction by insisting on the doubling of the spelling of n in the suffixof the past participle but not of the related adjective, as in ranennyy v ruku boetz "fighter wounded99in the arm" and ranenyy boetz "wounded fighter": the speakers reject his distinction both in pro-nunciation, where no consonant doubling is detectable, and in spelling, where the two forms areuniversally confused.4.1.5 Accidental GapsCases like impregnable above raise another significant issue.
The treatment of negation in deverbaladjectives i not very difficult: the negative quantifier can, in most cases, be simply added to thenon-negative adjective, and this applies to all of the negative prefices, such as un-, in- (ira-, etc.),dis-.
But impregnable, like quite a few other negative deverbal adjectives, does not have a non-neg-ative counterpart, which looks like an accidental gap.
In fact, the non-existence of a deverbal ad-jective, positive or negative, from the physical meaning of impregnate "make pregnant" is also anaccidental gap.
And, of course, a further complication is that im- in the verb is not negative whilein the adjective it is: this is, apparently, the reason for the non-existence of the positive adjective,but this reason is itself an accidental gap.Gaps of this kind abound throughout the corpus.
Why, for instance, there is perishable but not rot-table.
As we will see below, the former is a somewhat rare bird among the deverbal adjectives end-ing in -ble, but, on the face of it, there is no difference between food products rotting and foodproducts perishing--in fact, the former sounds more natural than the latter.
Nevertheless, rottablesounds less acceptable than perishable.4.1.6 SuppletivismMany deverbal adjectives in the corpus derive their lexical entries from verbs which are not mor-phologically related to them (14).
The LR, however, works with the same ease as in typical, mor-phologically derivative cases.
An even stronger case of suppletivism involves processes which donot have single-word verbs denoting them.
Nevertheless, it often makes ense--and this is a humanjudgment--to construct such verbs out of the appropriate ontological concept with necessary con-straints, because this is still the easiest way to construct lexical entries for some adjectives (15).Obviously, this kind of supersuppletivism would be impossible and arbitrary if implemented out-side a justified situated ontology.
(14)(15)(i) ablaze < burn(ii) audible < hear(iii) awful-2 < fear(i) affectionate < show-affection(ii) possible < can-happen(iii) brainy < show-intelligence4.1.7 SyncretismRelated to suppletivism, we discover quite a few deverbal adjectives "shared" by several verbs ona synonymous sense.
This, abandoned-2 is a deverbal of both abandon-V2 (see Section 4.1.3above) and leave in the same sense of "leave somebody or something at location" because the lat-ter's "own" deverbal, eft, is not comfortable in adjectival use, especially attributively:(16) (i)(ii)I abandoned a friend in Hope, AR--I have an abandoned friend in Hope, ARI left a friend in Russell, KS--*I have a left friend in Russell, KS!oo4.2 Adjectives Ending in .bleA large subclass of deverbal adjectives are adjectives that end in able/ible (cf.
Kjellmer 1986 andalso Hall 1877, Jespersen 1942, Marchand 1960, Abraham 1970, Meus 1975, for a discussion ofsuch adjectives in English, even though much of the discussion sheds little light on the semanticand lexicographic ssues in hand).
Just about all of them mean 'something than can be \[verb\]-ed':thus, readable means 'something that can be read.'
In other words, a typical -able entry is derivedfrom the lexical entry of the appropriate verb, with the positive potential attitude added, and in ei-ther the beneficiary or theme role, depending on the animateness/inanimateness of $varl, respec-tively (17i-ii).
(17) (i)(ii)(replaceable (replaceable-Adj 1B(CAT adj)(SYN-STRUC(1 ((root $varl)(eat n)(mods ((root $var0)))))(2 ((root Svar0)(cat adj)(subj ((root $varl)(cat n))))))(SEM-STRUC(LEX-MAP(replace(benef (value ^$varl))(m?dalit}t e( tvYa~uee 1.0) potential)(scop.e replace)(attributed-to *speaker*))))))(readable (readable-Adj 1T(CAT adj)(SYN-STRUC(1 ((root $varl)(cat n)(mods ((root $var0)))))(2 ((root $var0)(cat adj)(subj ((root $varl)(cat n))))))(SEM-STRUC(LEX-MAP(read(modality(theme (value ^$varl))(type ~.od~ntial )(value(scope read)(attributed-to *speaker*))))))The modality in the entries above corresponds, of course, to 'can' in the informal formula above.On the surface of it, these adjectives seem to be the best candidates for a fully automatic LR, espe-cially if the beneficiary/theme distinction can be taken care of on the basis of the animateness orinanimateness of the modified--and this can be done.
The problem is, however, that the beneficia-ry/theme combination of semantic ases for these deverbal adjectives, while accounting for a hugemajority of such adjectives in the corpus (close to 270 out of the 300 or so), is only one of the 17possible semantic-case combinations:(18) (i) A able-2 < be-able101(ii) A E culpable < do-bad(iii) E disreputable <feel-shame(iv) T E comprehensible < understand-1(v) can+A perishable < perish-2(vi) can+A can+E audible < hear(vii) can+B acceptable-2 < accept-1(viii) can+B can+T definable < define-l-3(ix) can+B can+T can+A adjustable < adjust-l-2(x) can+L livable < live-1(xi) can+T actionable < sue(xii) not+A incapable-2 < be-able(xiii) not+can+A inviable < live-1(xiv) not+can+B unacceptable-2 < accept-1(xv) not+can+B not+can+T undefinable < define-l-3(xvi) not+can+L uninhabitable < live-1(xvii) not+can+T impassable < pass-l-4Stripped of 'can' and 'not,' there are still 9 different types, and because 'can' and 'not' do not "ap-ply" universally, their presence or absence are not trivial.
Except for types (viii) and (xv), most ofthe types have few examples in the corpus, and perishable is alone in its type (v).
What it means,again, is that human judgment is necessary in deciding which, if any, case form of LRvA to applyto each verb.5.
ConclusionIn this paper, we have:?
introduced an ontological semantic approach to the lexical semantics of adjectives;?
described and exemplified two relevant zones from lexical entries of adjectives;?
demonstrated three major classes of adjectives, true scalars, denominals and deverbals;?
explained our notion of lexical rules and their importance to acquisition;?
discussed the lexical entries for deverbal adjectives and the role lexical rules play in their ac-quisition;?
focussed on the issue of full automation of lexical rules in large-scale acquisition;?
argued for a significant place for human judgment in the process.We believe, therefore, that LRs are worth discovering and activating only if they are clearly mass-productive, such as LRvA, which is central to this paper.
Otherwise, the human cost of manualchecking every verb entry before applying the rule to it would render each adjective ntry obtainedwith the help of the LR more--or at least no less--expensive than if it were produced manually"from scratch.
"Another important trade-off is between the cost of discovery and the productivity of the rule.
It ispleasant and challengeable for a linguist o think that each pragmatic relation is worth discoveringand activating in lexical acquisition.
It is equally interesting to attempt to discover a rule for eachand every exception and complication mentioned in Section 4.
The Young-Grammarian pproachto language was that every single fact had a rule attached to it.
This is probably true but not prac-tical.
Neither is the current postmodern approach that there are nice rules and then an area of chaos"because language is that way."
Our practical view is that a LR is useful for lexical acquisition if102it is easily discoverable and very productive.
We do not expect any such LR to be exception-free,and our methodology is comfortable dealing with those exceptions.AcknowledgmentThe research reported in this paper was supported by Contract MDA904-92-C-5189 with the U.S.Department ofDefense.
