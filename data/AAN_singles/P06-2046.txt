Thispaper discusses the lexical knowledge ofidioms for idiom recognition.
The chal-lenges are that idioms can be ambiguousbetween literal and idiomatic meanings,and that they can be ?transformed?
whenexpressed in a sentence.
However, therehas been little research on Japanese idiomrecognition with its ambiguity and trans-formations taken into account.
We pro-pose a set of lexical knowledge for idiomrecognition.
We evaluated the knowledgeby measuring the performance of an idiomrecognizer that exploits the knowledge.
Asa result, more than 90% of the idioms in acorpus are recognized with 90% accuracy.1 IntroductionRecognizing idioms in a sentence is important tosentence understanding.
Failure of recognizing id-ioms leads to, for example, mistranslation.In the case of the translation service of Excite1,it sometimes mistranslates sentences that containidioms such as (1a), due to the recognition failure.

(1b) is the mistranslationof (1a), in which the idiom is interpreted literally.In this paper, we discuss lexical knowledge foridiom recognition.
The lexical knowledge is im-plemented in an idiom dictionary that is used byan idiom recognizer we implemented.
Note thatthe idiom recognition we define includes distin-guishing literal and idiomatic meanings.2 Thoughthere has been a growing interest in MWEs (Saget al, 2002), few proposals on idiom recognitiontake into account ambiguity and transformations.Note also that we tentatively define an idiom as aphrase that is semantically non-compositional.
Aprecise characterization of the notion ?idiom?
isbeyond the scope of the paper.3Section 2 defines what makes idiom recognitiondifficult.
Section 3 discusses the classification ofJapanese idioms, the requisite lexical knowledge,and implementation of an idiom recognizer.
Sec-tion 4 evaluates the recognizer that exploits theknowledge.
After the overview of related worksin Section 5, we conclude the paper in Section 6.2 Two Challenges of Idiom RecognitionTwo factors make idiom recognition difficult: am-biguity between literal and idiomatic meaningsand ?transformations?
that idioms could un-dergo.4 In fact, the mistranslation in (1) is causedby the inability of disambiguation between the twomeanings.
?Transformation?

Weconcerned only whether a phrase is used as an idiom or not.3For a detailed discussion of what constitutes the notionof (Japanese) idiom, see Miyaji (1982), which details usagesof commonly used Japanese idioms.4The term ?transformation?
in the paper is not relevant tothe Chomskyan term in Generative Grammar.353lation.
Sentences in (2) and (3a) contain an idiom,yaku-ni tatu (part-DAT stand) ?serve the purpose.?
(2) Kare-wahe-TOPyaku-nipart-DATtatu.stand?He serves the purpose.?
(3) a. Kare-wahe-TOPyaku-nipart-DATsugokuverytatu.stand?He really serves the purpose.?b.
?He stands enormously in part.
?Google?s translation system5 mistranslates (3a) asin (3b), which does not make sense,6 though it suc-cessfully translates (2).
The only difference be-tween (2) and (3a) is that bunsetu7 constituents ofthe idiom are detached from each other.3 Knowledge for Idiom Recognition3.1 Classification of Japanese IdiomsRequisite lexical knowledge to recognize an idiomdepends on how difficult it is to recognize it.
Thus,we first classify idioms based on recognition diffi-culty.
The recognition difficulty is determined bythe two factors: ambiguity and transformability.Consequently, we identify three classes (Figure1).8 Class A is not transformable nor ambigu-ous.
Class B is transformable but not ambiguous.9Class C is transformable and ambiguous.
Class Aamounts to unambiguous single words, which areeasy to recognize, while Class C is the most diffi-cult to recognize.
Only Class C needs further clas-sifications, since only Class C needs disambigua-tion and lexical knowledge for disambiguation de-pends on its part-of-speech (POS) and internalstructure.
The POS of Class C is either verbalor adjectival, as in Figure 1.
Internal structurerepresents constituent words?
POS and a depen-dency between bunsetus.
The internal structure5http://www.google.co.jp/language tools6In fact, the idiom has no literal interpretation.7A bunsetu is a syntactic unit in Japanese, consisting ofone independent word and more than zero ancillary words.The sentence in (3a) consists of four bunsetu constituents.8The blank space at the upper left in the figure implies thatthere is no idiom that does not undergo any transformationand yet is ambiguous.
Actually, we have not come up withsuch an example that should fill in the blank space.9Anonymous reviewers pointed out that Class A and Bcould also be ambiguous.
In fact, one can devise a contextthat makes the literal interpretation of those Classes possible.However, virtually no phrase of Class A or B is interpretedliterally in real texts, and we think our generalization safelycaptures the reality of idioms.AmbiguousUnambiguousTransformableUntransformableClass Byaku-nipart-DATtatustand?serve the purpose?- Verbal- AdjectivalClass Chone-obone-ACCorubreak?make an effort?- Verbal- AdjectivalClass Amizu-mowater-TOOsitatarudrip?extremely handsome?- Adnominal- Nominal- AdverbialMore DifficultFigure 1: Idiom Classification based on theRecognition Difficultyof hone-o oru (bone-ACC bone), for instance, is?

abbreviated as ?
(N/P V).
?Then, let us give a full account of the furtherclassification of Class C. We exploit grammaticaldifferences between literal and idiomatic usagesfor disambiguation.
We will call the knowledge ofthe differences the disambiguation knowledge.For instance, a phrase, hone-o oru, does not al-low passivization when used as an idiom, thoughit does when used literally.
Thus, (4), in which thephrase is passivized, cannot be an idiom.
(4) hone-gabone-NOMo-rarerubreak-PASS?A bone is broken.
?In this case, passivizability can be used as a dis-ambiguation knowledge.
Also, detachability ofthe two bunsetu constituents can serve for disam-biguating the idiom; they cannot be separated.
Ingeneral, usages applicable to idioms are also ap-plicable to literal phrases, but the reverse is notalways true (Figure 2).
Then, finding the disam-Usages Applicable to Only Literal PhrasesUsages Applicable to BothIdioms and Literal PhrasesFigure 2: Difference of Applicable Usagesbiguation knowledge amounts to finding usagesapplicable to only literal phrases.Naturally, the disambiguation knowledge for anidiom depends on its POS and internal structure.354As for POS, disambiguation of verbal idioms canbe performed by the knowledge of passivizability,while that of adjectival idioms cannot.
Regardinginternal structure, detachability should be anno-tated on every boundary of bunsetus.
Thus, thenumber of annotations of detachability depends onthe number of bunsetus of an idiom.There is no need for further classification ofClass A and B, since lexical knowledge for them isinvariable.
The next section mentions their invari-ableness.
After all, Japanese idioms are classifiedas in Figure 3.
The whole picture of the subclassesof Class C remains to be seen.3.2 Knowledge for Each ClassWhat lexical knowledge is needed for each class?Class A needs only a string information; idiomsof the class amount to unambiguous single words.A string information is undoubtedly invariableacross all kinds of POS and internal structure.Class B requires not only a string but alsoknowledge that normalizes transformations id-ioms could undergo, such as passivization and de-tachment of bunsetus.
We identify three types oftransformations that are relevant to idioms: 1) De-tachment of Bunsetu Constituents, 2) Predicate?sChange, and 3) Particle?s Change.
Predicate?schange includes inflection, attachment of a neg-ative morpheme, a passive morpheme or modalverbs, and so on.
Particle?s change represents at-tachment of topic or restrictive particles.
(5b) is anexample of predicate?s change from (5a) by addinga negative morpheme to a verb.
(5c) is an exampleof particle?s change from (5a) by adding a topicparticle to the preexsistent particle of an idiom.
(5) a. Kare-wahe-TOPyaku-nipart-DATtatu.stand?He serves the purpose.?b.
Kare-wahe-TOPyaku-nipart-DATtat-anai.stand-NEG?He does not serve the purpose.?c.
Kare-wahe-TOPyaku-ni-wapart-DAT-TOPtatu.stand?He serves the purpose.
?To normalize the transformations, we utilize adependency relation between constituent words,and we call it the dependency knowledge.
Thisamounts to checking the presence of all the con-stituent words of an idiom.
Note that we ignore,among constituent words, endings of a predicateand case particles, ga (NOM) and o (ACC), sincethey could change their forms or disappear.The dependency knowledge is also invariableacross all kinds of POS and internal structure.Class C requires the disambiguation knowl-edge, as well as all the knowledge for Class B.As a result, all the requisite knowledge for id-iom recognition is summarized as in Table 1.String Dependency DisambiguationClass A ?Class B ?
?Class C ?
?
?Table 1: Requisite Knowledge for each ClassAs discussed in ?3.1, the disambiguationknowledge for an idiom depends on which sub-class it belongs to.
A comprehensive idiom recog-nizer calls for all the disambiguation knowledgefor all the subclasses, but we have not figured outall of them.
Then, we decided to blaze a trail todiscover the disambiguation knowledge by inves-tigating the most commonly used idioms.3.3 Disambiguation Knowledge for theVerbal (N/P V) IdiomsWhat type of idiom is used most commonly?
Theanswer is the verbal (N/P V) type like hone-o oru (bone-ACC break); it is the most abundant interms of both type and token.
Actually, 1,834 outof 4,581 idioms (40%) in Kindaichi and Ikeda(1989), which is a Japanese dictionary with morethan 100,000 words, are this type.10 Also, 167,268out of 220,684 idiom tokens in Mainichi newspa-per of 10 years (?91?
?00) (76%) are this type.11Then we discuss what can be used to disam-biguate the verbal (N/P V) type.
First, we exam-ined literature of linguistics (Miyaji, 1982; Morita,1985; Ishida, 2000) that observed characteristicsof Japanese idioms.
Then, among the characteris-tics, we picked those that could help with the dis-ambiguation of the type.
(6) summarizes them.10Counting was performed automatically by means of themorphological analyzer ChaSen (Matsumoto et al, 2000)with no human intervention.
Note that Kindaichi and Ikeda(1989) consists of 4,802 idioms, but 221 of them were ig-nored since they contained unknown words for ChaSen.11We counted idiom tokens by string matching with inflec-tion taken into account.
And we referred to Kindaichi andIkeda (1989) for a comprehensive idiom list.
Note that count-ing was performed totally automatically.355RecognitionDifficultyPOSInternalStructureJapanese IdiomsClass CVerb(N/P V)hone-obone-ACCorubreak?make an effort?

(Someone) breaks his bone.
?That is, the Genitive Phrase Prohibition, (6aII), isin effect for the idiom.
Likewise, the idiom doesnot allow its case particle o (ACC) to be substi-tuted with restrictive particles such as dake (only).Thus, (8) represents only a literal meaning.
(8) hone-dakebone-ONLYorubreak?
(Someone) breaks only some bones.

represents those verbal expres-sions of order, request, permission, prohibition, and volition.This means the Restrictive Particle Constraint,(6b), is also in effect.
Also, (4) shows that thePassivization Prohibition, (6cI), is in effect, too.Note that the constraints in (6) are not alwaysin effect for an idiom.
For instance, the Causativi-zation Prohibition, (6cII), is invalid for the idiom,hone-o oru.
In fact, (9a) can be interpreted bothliterally and idiomatically.

?3.4 ImplementationWe implemented an idiom dictionary based on theoutcome above and a recognizer that exploits thedictionary.
This section illustrates how they work,and we focus on Class B and C hereafter.The idiom recognizer looks up dependencypatterns in the dictionary that match a part of thedependency structure of a sentence (Figure 4).
Adependency pattern is equipped with all the req-uisite knowledge for idiom recognition.
Roughsketch of the recognition algorithm is as follows:1.
Analyze the morphology and dependencystructures of an input sentence.2.
Look up dependency patterns in the dictio-nary that match a part of the dependencystructure of the input sentence.3.
Mark constituents of an idiom in the sentenceif any.13 Constituents that are marked areconstituent words and bunsetu constituentsthat include one of those constituent words.13As a constituent marker, we use an ID that is assigned toeach idiom in the dictionary.356Inputyaku-ni-wapart-DAT-TOPmattakutotallytat-anaistand-NEGMorphology &DependencyAnalysisDependencyMatchingyakupart/ niDAT/ waTOPmattakutotallytatustand/ naiNEGOutputyakupart/ niDAT/ waTOPmattakutotallytatustand/ naiNEGIdiomRecognizerIdiomDictionary?

Dependencymatching is performed by TGrep2 (Rohde, 2005),which finds syntactic patterns in a sentence or tree-bank.
The dependency pattern is usually gettingcomplicated since it is tailored to the specifica-tion of TGrep2.
Thus, we developed the Depen-dency Pattern Generator that compiles the patterndatabase from a human-readable idiom dictionary.Only the difference in treatments of Class B andC lies in their dependency patterns.
The depen-dency pattern of Class B consists of only its depen-dency knowledge, while that of Class C consistsof not only its dependency knowledge but also itsdisambiguation knowledge (Figure 6).The idiom dictionary consists of 100 idioms,which are all verbal (N/P V) and belong to eitherClass B or C. Among the knowledge in (6), theSelectional Restriction has not been implementedyet.
The 100 idioms are those that are used mostfrequently.
To be precise, 50 idioms in Kindaichiand Ikeda (1989) and 50 in Miyaji (1982) wereextracted by the following steps:141.
From Miyaji (1982), 50 idioms that were14We counted idiom tokens by string matching with inflec-tion taken into account.

?00) were extracted.2.
From Kindaichi and Ikeda (1989), 50 idiomsthat were used most frequently in the newspa-per of 10 years but were not included in the50 idioms from Miyaji (1982) were extracted.As a result, 66 out of the 100 idioms were ClassB, and the other 34 idioms were Class C.154 Evaluation4.1 Experiment ConditionWe conducted an experiment to see the effective-ness of the lexical knowledge we proposed.As an evaluation corpus, we collected 300 ex-ample sentences of the 100 idioms from Mainichinewspaper of ?95: three sentences for each id-iom.
Then we added another nine sentences forthree idioms that are orthographic variants of oneof the 100 idioms.
Among the three idioms, onebelonged to Class B and the other two belonged toClass C. Thus, 67 out of the 103 idioms were ClassB and the other 36 were Class C. After all, 30915We found that the most frequently used 100 idioms inKindaichi and Ikeda (1989) cover as many as 53.49% of alltokens in Mainichi newspaper of 10 years.
This implies thatour dictionary accounts for approximately half of all idiomtokens in a corpus.357Dependency PatternDisambiguationKnowledge?AdnominalModification Cs?Topic/RestrictiveParticle Cs?Detachment C?Voice Cs?Modality CsDependencyKnowledge?

Note that the rec-ognizer made fewer errors due to the employmentof the disambiguation knowledge.The result shows the high performances.
How-ever, there turns out to be a long way to go to solvethe most difficult problem of idiom recognition:drawing a line between literal and idiomatic mean-ings.
In fact, the precision of recognizing idiomsof Class C remains less than 70% as in Table 3.Besides, the recognizer successfully rejected only15 out of 42 negative sentences.
That is, its suc-cess rate of rejecting negative ones is only 35.71%4.3 Discussion of the DisambiguationKnowledgeFirst of all, positive sentences, i.e., sentences con-taining true idioms, are in the blank region of Fig-ure 2, while negative ones, i.e., those containingliteral phrases, are in both regions.
Accordingly,the disambiguation amounts to i) rejecting nega-tive ones in the shaded region, ii) rejecting nega-tive ones in the blank region, or iii) accepting pos-itive ones in the blank region.
i) is relatively easysince there are visible evidences in a sentence thattell us that it is NOT an idiom.
However, ii) andiii) are difficult due to the absence of visible evi-dences.
Our method is intended to perform i), andthus has an obvious limitation.Next, we look cloosely at cases of success orfailure of rejecting negative sentences.
There were15 cases where rejection succeeded, which corre-spond to i).
The disambiguation knowledge thatcontributed to rejection and the number of sen-tences it rejects are as follows.161.

1This shows that the Adnominal Modification Con-straints, 1. and 2. above, are the most effective.There were 27 cases where rejection failed.These are classified into two types:16There was one case where rejection succeeded due to thedependency analysis error.358Class B Class C AllRecall 0.975 (195200) 0.939 (6266) 0.966 (257266)Precision 1.000 (195195) 0.697 (6289) 0.905 (257284)F-Measure 0.987 0.800 0.935Class B Class C All0.975 (195200) 0.939 (6266) 0.966 (257266)1.000 (195195) 0.602 ( 62103) 0.862 (257298)0.987 0.734 0.911Table 3: Performances of the Recognizer (left side) and the Baseline System (right side)1.

221. and 2. correspond to i) and ii), respectively.We see that the Selectional Restriction would havebeen as effective as the Adnominal ModificationConstraints.
A part of a sentence that the knowl-edge could have rejected is below.
(10) basu-gabus-NOMtyuu-nimidair-DATui-tafloat-PAST?The bus floated in midair.
?An idiom, tyuu-ni uku (midair-DAT float) ?remainto be decided,?
takes as its argument somethingthat can be decided, i.e., ?1000:abstract?
ratherthan ?2:concrete?
in the sense of the Goi-Taikeiontology (Ikehara et al, 1997).
Thus, (10) has noidiomatic sense.A simplified example of 2. is illustrated in (11).
(11) ase-osweat-ACCnagasi-teshed-andhuku-oclothes-ACCkiru-yorimo,wear-rather.than,hadaka-ganudity-NOMgouriteki-darational-DECL?It makes more sense to be naked thanwearing clothes in a sweat.
?The phrase ase-o nagasu (sweat-ACC shed) couldhave been an idiom meaning ?work hard.?
It iscontextual knowledge that prevented it from beingthe idiom.
Clearly, our technique is unable to han-dle such a case, which belongs to ii), since no vis-ible evidence is available.
Dealing with that mightrequire some sort of machine learning techniquethat exploits contextual information.
Exploringthat possibility is one of our future works.Finally, the 42 negative sentences consist of 15sentences, which we could disambiguate, 5 sen-tences, which Selectional Restriction could havedisambiguated, and 22, which belong to ii) and arebeyond the current technique.
Thus, the real chal-lenge lies in 7% ( 22309) of all idiom occurrences.4.4 Discussion of the Dependency KnowledgeThe dependency knowledge failed in only fivecases.
Three of them were due to the defectof dealing with case particles?
change like omis-sion.
The other two cases were due to the nounconstituent?s incorporation into a compound noun.
(12) is a part of such a case.
(12) kaihuku-kidou-nirecovery-orbit-DATnori-hajimeruride-begin?
(Economics) get back on a recovery track.
?The idiom, kidou-ni noru (orbit-DAT ride) ?get ontrack,?
has a constituent, kidou, which is incorpo-rated into a compound noun kaihuku-kidou ?re-covery track.?
This is unexpected and cannot behandled by the current machinery.5 Related WorkThere has been a growing awareness of JapaneseMWE problems (Baldwin and Bond, 2002).
How-ever, few attempts have been made to recognize id-ioms in a sentence with their ambiguity and trans-formations taken into account.
In fact, most ofthem only create catalogs of Japanese idiom: col-lecting idioms as many as possible and classifyingthem based on some general linguistic properties(Tanaka, 1997; Shudo et al, 2004).A notable exception is Oku (1990); his id-iom recognizer takes the ambiguity and transfor-mations into account.
However, he only usesthe Genitive Phrase Prohibition, the DetachmentConstraint, and the Selectional Restriction, whichwould be too few to disambiguate idioms.17 Aswell, his classification does not take the recogni-tion difficulty into account.
This makes his id-iom dictionary get bloated, since disambiguationknowledge is given to unambiguous idioms, too.Uchiyama et al (2005) deals with disambiguat-ing some Japanese verbal compounds.
Thoughverbal compounds are not counted as idioms, theirstudy is in line with this study.17We cannot compare his recognizer with ours numericallysince no disambiguation success rate is presented in Oku(1990); only the overall performance is presented.359Our classification of idioms correlates looselywith that of MWEs by Sag et al (2002).
Japaneseidioms that we define correspond to lexicalizedphrases.
Among lexicalized phrases, fixed expres-sions are equal to Class A.
Class B and C roughlycorrespond to semi-fixed or syntactically-flexibleexpressions.
Note that, though the three subtypesof lexicalized phrases are distinguished based onwhat we call transformability, no distinction ismade based on the ambiguity.186 ConclusionAiming at Japanese idiom recognition with am-biguity and transformations taken into accout, weproposed a set of lexical knowledge for idioms andimplemented a recognizer that exploits the knowl-edge.
We maintain that requisite knowledge de-pends on its transformability and ambiguity; trans-formable idioms require the dependency knowl-edge, while ambiguous ones require the disam-biguation knowledge as well as the dependencyknowledge.
As the disambiguation knowledge,we proposed a set of constraints applicable to aphrase when it is used as an idiom.
The experi-ment showed that more than 90% idioms could berecognized with 90% accuracy but the success rateof rejecting negative sentences remained 35.71%.The experiment also revealed that, among the dis-ambiguation knowledge, the Adnominal Modifi-cation Constraints and the Selectional Restrictionare the most effective.What remains to be done is two things; one isto reveal all the subclasses of Class C and all thedisambiguation knowledge, and the other is to ap-ply a machine learning technique to disambiguat-ing those cases that the current technique is unableto handle, i.e., cases without visible evidence.In conclusion, there is still a long way to go todraw a perfect line between literal and idiomaticmeanings, but we believe we broke new ground inJapanese idiom recognition.Acknowledgment A special thank goes toGakushu Kenkyu-sha, who permitted us to useGakken?s Dictionary for our research.18The notion of decomposability of Sag et al (2002)and Nunberg et al (1994) is independent of ambigu-ity.
In fact, ambiguous idioms are either decomposable(hara-ga kuroi (belly-NOM black) ?black-hearted?)
or non-decomposable (hiza-o utu (knee-ACC hit) ?have a brain-wave?).
Also, unambiguous idioms are either decomposable(hara-o yomu (belly-ACC read) ?fathom someone?s think-ing?)
or non-decomposable (saba-o yomu (chub.mackerel-ACC read) ?cheat in counting?
