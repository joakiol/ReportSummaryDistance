We consider this prob-lem in the context of the so called ontology-lexicon interface, which attempts to capture thesemantics of words by reference to an ontology in description logics or some other, typicallyfirst-order, logical formalism.
The use of first order logic (hence also description logics), whileeffective for nouns and verbs, breaks down in the case of adjectives.
We argue that this is primar-ily due to a lack of logical expressivity in the underlying ontology languages.
In particular, be-yond the straightforward intersective adjectives, there exist gradable adjectives, requiring fuzzyor non-monotonic semantics, as well as operator adjectives, requiring second-order logic formodelling.
We consider how we can extend the ontology-lexicon interface as realized by extantmodels such as lemon in the face of the issues mentioned above, in particular those arising in thecontext of modelling the ontological semantics of adjectives.
We show howmore complex logicalformalisms that are required to capture the ontological semantics of adjectives can be backwardengineered into OWL-based modelling by means of pseudo-classes.
We discuss the implicationsof this modelling in the context of application to ontology-based question answering.1 IntroductionOntology-lexicon models, such as lemon (Lexicon Model for Ontologies) (McCrae et al., 2012) modelthe semantics of open class words by capturing their semantics with respect to the semantic vocabularydefined in a given ontology.
Such ontology-lexica are built around the separation of a lexical layer, de-scribing how a word or phrase acts syntactically and morphologically, and a semantic layer describinghow the meaning of a word is expressed in a formal logical model, such as OWL (Web Ontology Lan-guage) (Deborah L. McGuinness and others, 2004).
As such, the modelling is based around a lexicalentry which describes the morphology and syntax of a word, and is linked by means of a lexical senseto an ontology entity defined in a given ontology described in formal logic.
It has been shown that thisprinciple known as semantics by reference (Buitelaar, 2010) is an effective model that can support thetask of developing question answering systems (Unger and Cimiano, 2011) and natural language gen-eration (Cimiano et al., 2013) over backends based on Semantic Web data models.
The Pythia system,which builds on the lemon formalism to declaratively capture the lexicon-ontology interface, for exam-ple, has been instantiated to the case of answering questions from DBpedia (Unger and Cimiano, 2011).However, as has been shown by the Question Answering over Linked Data (Lopez et al., 2013, QALD)benchmarking campaigns, there are many questions that can be asked over this database that require adeeper representation of the semantics of words, adjectives in particular.
For example, questions suchThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.
Page numbers and proceedings footerare added by the organisers.
Licence details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/198as (1a) require understanding of the semantics of ?high?
in a manner that goes beyond the expressivity ofOWL.
The formalization of this question as an executable query formulated with respect to the SPARQLquery language is provided in (1b).
In particular, the interpretation of this question involves the formalinterpretation of the word ?high?
as relating to the property dbo:elevation, including ordering andsubset selection operations.1.
(a) What is the highest mountain in Australia?
(b) SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {?uri rdf:type dbo:Mountain .
?uri dbo:locatedInArea res:Australia .
?uri dbo:elevation ?elevation .}
ORDER BY DESC(?elevation) LIMIT 1In the above query, we select an entity denoted by the query variable ?uri that has the propertiesthat i) the entity?s type is a mountain, ii) it is located in Australia, and iii) it has an elevation bound tothe variable ?elevation.
We then sort the query in descending order by the value of the elevationand limit so the query returns only the first result, in effect choosing the largest value in the data set.It has been claimed that first-order logic and thus by extension description logics, such as OWL, ?faildecidedly when it comes to adjectives?
(Bankston, 2003).
In fact, we largely agree that the semantics ofmany adjectives are difficult or impossible to describe in first-order logic.
However, from the point ofview of the ontology-lexicon interface, the logical expressivity of the ontology is not a limiting factor.
Infact, due to the separation of the lexical and ontology layers in a model such as lemon, it is possible toexpress the meaning of words without worrying about the formalism used in the ontology.
To this extent,we will first demonstrate that adjectives are in general a case where the use of description logics (DL)breaks down, and for which more sophisticated logical formalisms must be applied.
We then considerto what extent this can be handled in the context of the ontology-lexicon, and introduce pseudo-classes,that is OWL classes with annotations, which we use to express the semantics of adjectives in a mannerthat would allow reasoning with fuzzy, high-order models.
To this extent, we base our models on thepreviously introduced design patterns (McCrae and Unger, 2014) for modelling ontology-lexica.
Finally,we show how these semantics can be helpful in practical applications of question answering over theDBpedia knowledge base.2 Classification of adjectivesThere are a number of classifications of adjectives.
First we will start with the most fundamental dis-tinction between attributive and predicative usage, that is the use of adjectives in noun phrases (?X is aA N?)
versus as objects of the copula (?X is A?).
It should be noted that there are many adjectives forwhich only predicative or attributive usage is allowed, as shown in (3a) and (3).2.
(a) Clinton is a former president.
(b)?Clinton is former.3.
(a) The baby is awake.
(b)?The awake baby.One of the principle classifications of the semantics of adjectives (for example (Partee, 2003; Bouillonand Viegas, 1999; Morzycki, 2013b)) is based on the meaning of adjective noun compounds relative tothe meaning of the single words that form the compound.
This classification is as follows (where ?denotes entailment).Intersective (X is a A N ?
X is A ?
X is a N ) Such adjectives work as if they were another nounand indicate that the compound noun phrase is a member of class denoted by the noun and the classdenoted by the adjective.
For example, in the phrase ?Belgian violinist?
it refers to a person in theclass intersection Belgian ?
V iolinist(X), and hence we can infer that a ?Belgian violinist?
is asubclass of a ?Belgian?.
Furthermore, we could conclude that if the same person were a surgeon,he/she would also be a ?Belgian Surgeon?.199Subsective (X is a AN ?
X is a N , but X is a A N ??
X is A) Such adjectives acquire their specificmeaning in combination with the noun the modify.
For example, a ?skilful violinist?
is certainly inthe class V iolinist(X) but the described person is ?skilful as a violinist?, but not skilful in general,e.g.
as a surgeon.Privative (X is a A N ??
X is a N ) These adjectives modify the meaning of a noun phrase to create anoun phrase that is potentially incompatible with the original meaning.
For example, a ?fake gun?is not a member of the class of guns.Another important distinction is whether adjectives are gradable, i.e.
whether a comparative or su-perlative statement with these adjectives makes sense.
For example, adjectives such as ?big?
or ?tall?
canexpress relationships such as ?X is bigger than Y ?.
However it is not possible to say that one individ-ual is ?more former?.
Most gradable adjectives are subsective (e. g.?a big mouse?
is not ?a big animal?
(Morzycki, 2013a)).Finally, we consider operator or property-modifying adjectives.
They can be understood along thelines of privative adjectives but differ in that they represent operators that modify some property in thequalia structure (Pustejovsky, 1991) of the class.
For instance, we may express the adjective ?former?
inlambda calculus as a function that takes a class C as input and returns the class of entities that were amember of C to some prior time point t (Partee, 2003):?C[?x?tC(x, t) ?
t < now]Such adjectives have not only a difference in semantic meaning but can also frequently have syntacticimpact, for example in adjective ordering restrictions, as they may be reordered with only semanticimpact (Teodorescu, 2006), e.g.,4.
(a) A big red car.
(b)?A red big car.5.
(a) A famous former actor.
(b) A former famous actor.Finally, we define object-relational adjectives as those adjectives which have a meaning that expressesa relationship between two individuals or events1, for example:6.
He is related to her.7.
She is similar to her brother.8.
This is useful for something.3 Representation of adjectives in the ontology-lexicon interfaceIn general it is assumed that adjectives form frames with exactly one argument except for extra argumentsprovided by adjuncts, typically prepositional phrases.
Most adjectives are thus associated with a pred-icative frame, which much like the standard noun predicate frame (X is a N ) is stereotyped in Englishas:X is AThe attributive usage of an adjective is associate to a stereotypical frame where the N?
argument isnot semantically bound, but can instead be obtained by syntactic unification to a noun predicate frame:X is A N?As such, when we encounter the attributive usage of an adjective such as in 9, we understand this asthe realization of two frames, given in 10.9.
Juan is a Spanish researcher.10.
(a) Juan is a researcher.
(b) Juan is a Spanish N?Note that we do not provide modelling for adjectives where the meaning is unique for a particularnoun phrase, such as ?polar bear?, which we would capture as a normal noun phrase with meaning ursusmaritimus.1Our definition of relational here is borrowed from the idea of relational nouns (De Bruin and Scha, 1988) as a word that requiresan argument.
Our definition is also different from the one for ?relational adjectives?
as proposed by (Morzycki, 2013a).200Figure 1: Modelling of an intersective adjective ?Belgian?
in lemon3.1 Intersective adjectivesIntersective adjectives are the most straightforward class, as in many cases they can be modelled es-sentially as a noun or verb (e.g.
deverbal adjectives such as ?broken?).
Intersective adjectives take oneargument and can thus be modelled as unary predicates in first-order logic or classes in OWL, as de-scribed by McCrae and Unger (2014).
For practical modelling examples, we will use the lemon model,since it is the most prominent implementation of the ontology-lexicon interface.The primary mechanism of modelling the syntax-semantics interface in the context of lemon is bymeans of assigning a frame as a syntactic behaviour of an entry and giving it syntactic arguments, whichcan then be linked to the lexical sense, which stands proxy for a true semantic frame in the ontology.
Forexample, the modelling of an adjective such as ?Belgian?
can be achieved as follows (depicted in Figure1)2.lexicon:belgian a lemon:LexicalEntry ;lemon:canonicalForm belgian:Lemma ;lemon:synBehavior belgian:AttrFrame ,belgian:PredFrame ;lemon:sense belgian:Sense .belgian:Lemma lemon:writtenRep "Belgian"@eng .belgian:AttrFrame lexinfo:attributiveArg belgian:AttrSynArg .belgian:PredFrame lexinfo:copulativeArg belgian:PredSynArg .belgian:sense lemon:reference [ a owl:Restriction ;owl:onProperty dbpedia:nationality ;owl:hasValue dbpedia:Belgium ] ;lemon:isA belgian:AttrSynArg , belgian:PredSynArg .In this example, the word ?Belgian?
is associated with a lemma with representation ?Belgian?, twoframe objects and a lexical sense.
The frame objects describe the attributive and predicative usage,and are associated with an attributive and copulative argument respectively.
The sense links the wordto the anonymous ontological class for objects that have ?Belgium?
as the value of their ?national-ity?
property and furthermore the arguments of each frame are linked to the sense in order to estab-lish a correspondence between the ontology class and the syntactic frames.
Note that here we usethe external vocabulary defined in the LexInfo ontology (Cimiano et al., 2011) to define the mean-ing of the arguments of the frame as the attributive argument, corresponding to the frame stereo-type ?X is A N??
and the copulative argument for the frame stereotype ?X is A?.
Furthermore, the2We assume that the namespaces are defined for the lexicon as lexicon, e.g., http://www.example.org/lexiconand for the entry, e.g., belgian is http://www.example.org/lexicon/belgian#.
Other namespaces are as-sumed to be as usual.201class of Belgians is not named in our reference ontology DBpedia, so we introduce an anonymousclass with the axiomatization, i.e.
?
nationality .Belgium.
It is in fact common that the referent ofan adjective is not named in an ontology.
An obvious choice is thus to model denominal adjec-tives as classes of the form ?
prop.Value, where Value is an individual that represents the seman-tics of the noun from which the adjective was derived.
This modelling is so common that it has al-ready been encoded as two design patterns, called IntersectiveObjectPropertyAdjectiveand IntersectiveDatatypePropertyAdjective (see (McCrae and Unger, 2014)).
Simi-larly, most deverbal adjectives refer to an event, and as such a common modelling is of the form?
theme?1.EventClass.
For example, ?vandalized?
may be ?
theme?1.VandalismEvent.3.2 Gradable adjectives and relevant observablesGradable adjectives have a number of properties which differentiate them from intersective adjectives:?
They occur in comparative constructions, in English with either ?-er?
or ?more?
(Kennedy and Mc-Nally, 1999), e.g.
?smaller?
and ?more frequent?, as opposed to intersectives such as ?
*less geologi-cal?
and ?
*more wooden?.?
Gradable adjectives can be defined as ?scalar?, since their value can ideally be measured on a scaleof set degrees?
They have a context-dependent truth-conditional variability, meaning that their positive form is un-derstood in relation to the class of the object modified by the adjective.
For example, an ?expensivewatch?
has a different price scale to an ?expensive bottle of water?.?
They are frequently fuzzy (or vague) (Kennedy, 2007).?
There may be a minimum or maximum of the adjective?s scale, which can be determined by, forexample, whether they can modified by adverbs such as ?completely?
or ?utterly?.As such, we define gradable adjectives relative to a particular property.
These adjectives are alsocalled ?observable?
(Bennett, 2006)3as they are related to some observable or measurable property, e.g.size in the case of ?big?.
However, a specification of the observable property is clearly not sufficient todifferentiate between the meaning of antonyms such as big and small.
Thus, we introduce the notions ofcovariance and contravariance, which specify whether the comparative form indicates a higher propertyvalue for the subject or the object.
In this sense ?big?
is covariant with size, as bigger things have ahigher size value, and ?small?
is contravariant with size.4We also introduce a third concept, i.e.
the oneof absolute gradability, which expresses the fact that the degree of membership in the denotation of theadjective is stronger the more it approaches a prototypical or ideal value.
A common example of this iscolours, where we may say that some object is redder than another if it is closer to some ideal value ofred (e.g., RGB 0xff0000).While these notions can handle the comparative structure of the semantics of adjectives, the predicativeand superlative usage of adjectives is complicated by three factors that we will outline below.
We noticethat gradable classes are not crisply defined like in the case of many intersective adjectives.
In fact, whilewe can clearly define all people in the world as ?Belgian?
or ?not Belgian?, according to whom holdsa Belgian passport or not, it is not easy to split the world?s population into ?tall?
and ?not tall?
(This isknown as sorites paradox (Bennett, 2006)).
Furthermore, while it may be easy to say that someone withheight 6?6?
(198cm) is ?tall?, it is not clear whether someone with height 6?
(182cm) is ?tall?, althoughcompared to an average (different) height for a man, they are ?taller?.
As such, one frequently used wayto deal with this class of vague adjectives (and nouns) is via fuzzy logic (Goguen, 1969; Zadeh, 1975;Zadeh, 1965; Dubois and Prade, 1988; Bennett, 2006).
Secondly, we notice that these class boundariesare non-monotonic, that is that with knowledge of more instances of the relative class we must reviseour class boundaries.
This is especially the case for superlatives, as the discovery of a new tallest person3Note that in many cases the property is quite abstract such as in ?breakable?.4The use of these terms is borrowed from type systems, and resembles the concept of ?converse observables?
as introduced by((Bennett, 2006):42).
As stated by the author, adjectives often come in pairs of polar opposites (e. g. conv(tall) = short, andboth refer to the same observable (in this case size).
Some observables analogously hold converse relationships with otherobservables (e. g. conv(flexibility) = rigidity or conv(tallness) = shortness).202in the world would remove the existing tallest person in the world from the class of tallest person in theworld.
This non-monotonicity also affects the class boundaries of the gradable class itself.
For example,in the 18th century, the average height of a male was 5?5?
(165cm)5; as such a male of 6?
would haveclearly been considered tall.It follows from this that each instance added to our ontology might lead to a revision of the classboundaries of a gradable class, hence leading to the fact that gradable adjectives are fundamentally non-monotonic.
We must also notice that gradability can only be understood relative to the class that we wishto grade.
Thus, while it is a priori unclear whether 6?
is tall for a male, it is clear that 6?
is tall for afemale given the current average height of a female being about 5?4?
(162cm).We can therefore conclude that gradable adjectives are fuzzy, non-monotonic and context-sensitive, allof which are incompatible with the description logic used in OWL.Pseudo-classes in lemonOILSCurrently there are only limited models for representing fuzzy logic in the context of the Web (Zhao andBoley, 2008).
In order to capture the properties of gradable adjectives, we introduce a new model whichwe name lemonOILS (The lemon Ontology for the Interpretation of Lexical Semantics)6.
This ontologyintroduces three new classes:?
CovariantScalar, indicating that the adjective is covariant with its bound property?
ContravariantScalar, indicating that the adjective is contravariant with its bound property?
AbsoluteScalar, indicating that the property represents similarity to an absolute valueIn addition, the following properties are introduced to enable the description of gradable adjectives.Note that all these properties are typed as annotation properties in the OWL ontology, so that they donot interfere with the standard OWL reasoning.?
boundTo indicates the property that a scalar refers to (e.g., ?size?
for ?big?)?
threshold specifies a sensible minimal value for which the adjective can be said to hold?
absoluteValue is the ideal value of an absolute scalar?
degree is specified as weak, medium, strong or very strong, corresponding to approxi-mately 50%, 25%, 5% or 1% of all known individuals?
comparator indicates an object property that is equivalent to the comparison of the adjective(e.g., an object property biggerThan may be considered a comparator for the adjective classbig)?
measure indicates a unit that can be used as a measure for this adjective, e.g., ?John is 175 cen-timetres tall?.Using such classes we can capture the semantics of gradable adjectives syntactically but not formallywithin an OWL model.
As such, we call these introduced classes pseudo-classes.
An example of mod-elling an adjective such as ?high?
is given below (and depicted in Figure 2).lexicon:high a lemon:LexicalEntry ;lemon:canonicalForm high:Lemma ;lemon:synBehavior high:PredFrame ;lemon:sense high:Sense .high:Lemma lemon:writtenRep "high"@eng .high:PredFrame lexinfo:copulativeArg high:PredArg .high:Sense lemon:reference [rdfs:subClassOf oils:CovariantScalar ;oils:boundTo dbpedia:elevation ;oils:degree oils:strong ] ;lemon:isA high:PredArg .5https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_height6http://lemon-model.net/oils203Figure 2: An example of the modelling of ?high?
in lemonAs an example of a logic in which these annotations could be interpreted, we consider MarkovLogic (Richardson and Domingos, 2006), which is an extension of first-order logic in which each clauseis given a cost.
The process of reasoning is thus transformed into an optimization problem of findingthe extension which minimizes the summed weight of all violated clauses.
As such, we can formulatea gradable adjective based on the number of known instances.
For example, we can specify ?big?
withrespect to size for some class C as in (11).11.
?x ?
C, y ?
C : size(x) > size(y) ?
bigC(x) : ?
?x ?
C, y ?
C : size(x) < size(y) ?
?bigC(x) : ?In this way, the classification of an object into ?big?
or ?small?
can be defined as follows.
For an individualx ?
C, the property bigC(x) holds if and only if:|{y ?
C, size(y) > size(x)}|?
< |{y ?
C, size(y) < size(x)}|?where the values of ?
and ?
are related to the degree defined in the ontology.We see that ?big?
defined in this way has the three properties outlined above: it is non-monotonic (inthat more individuals may change whether we consider an individual to be ?big?
or not), it is fuzzy (givenby the strength of the probability of the proposition bigC(x)), and it is context-sensitive (as whether anindividual counts as big or not depends on the class C).
Furthermore, our definition does not rely ondefining ?big?
for a given class, but instead is inferred from some known number of instances of thisclass.
This eliminates the need to define a threshold for each individual class, or even to define thepredicate bigCon a per-class basis.The supervaluation theory and SUMOAnother way to capture the meaning of these vague terms can be achieved by supervaluation semantics.Through supervaluation theory, the modelling or positioning of sorites vague concepts is grounded in ajudgement or meaning that lies on arbitrary thresholds, but these thresholds are based on a number ofrelevant objective measures (Bennett, 2006).A recent extension of the SUMO ontology (Niles and Pease, 2001, Suggested Upper Merged On-tology)7includes default measurements (currently amounting to 300+) added to the Artifacts,Devices and Objects enlisted in the ontology (and marked with capitals).
The compilation ofdefaultMeasurements in SUMO has been just conducted on observables, not on predicates.
Givenfor instance an Artifact such as Book, the compilation of its default measurements would look like:;;Book(defaultMinimumHeight Book (MeasureFn 10 Inch))(defaultMaximumHeight Book (MeasureFn 11 Inch))(defaultMinimumLength Book (MeasureFn 5.5 Inch))(defaultMaximumLength Book (MeasureFn 7 Inch))(defaultMinimumWidth Book (MeasureFn 1.2 Inch))(defaultMaximumWidth Book (MeasureFn 5.5 Inch))7www.ontologyportal.org204The example for Book shows that the default measurements for the observable reflect a standard kindof book, i.e., one of the most commonly known kinds of the same artifact.
As for this case, SUMOimplies Book to be a physical object with a certain length, height and width (and possibly weight).
Aweakness here is that the there is no systematic connection between the defaultMinimumHeightand Height or Width, since these physical properties have been defined in SUMO just in terms offirst-order logic, and have not been assigned default measurements yet.
With lemonOILS we can add thisinformation as follows:sumo:Book oils:default [oils:defaultFor sumo:height ;oils:defaultMin "10in" ;oils:defaultMax "11in" ] .Then, if we understand a lexical entry ?high?
as referring to a scalar covariant pseudo-class forsumo:height, it is possible to understand that a ?high?
object exceeds the default minimum set es-tablished for the same object and owns at the same time a value for ?high?
which does not go beyond theestablished default maximum.
A further weakness of this approach is captured by the following example:12.
Avery Johnson is a short basketball player.Here, we see the difficulty in interpreting the sentence, as Avery Johnson is in fact of average height(5?10?)
but for the class of basketball players he is unusually short.
While SUMO has some very specificlistings of subsets for the same Artifact8, SUMO does not provide a well-structured subset net fore.
g. Person.As a way to address this bottleneck, we could introduce default values for every subclassof Person, as well as to introduce default values for the same Artifact in conjunction with a predicateor adjective (e. g. BigPerson, BulkyPerson).
The creation of such ad hoc subclasses is not feasiblein general, as we would have to introduce a new class into the ontology for every combination of anadjective and a noun.
On the other side though, the SUMO default measurements serve the purposethey were originally conceived for, namely to be an arbitrary, yet computable approximation of physicalmeasures.3.3 Operator adjectivesOperator adjectives are those that combine with a noun to modify the meaning of the noun itself.
Thereare two primary issues with the understanding of the adjective in this manner.
Firstly, the referenceof the lexical item does not generally refer to an existing item in the ontology, but rather is novel andproductive, in the sense that it generates a new class.
Secondly, the compositional nature of adjective-noun compounds is no longer simple, as in the cases of intersective and gradable adjectives.
This meansthat, in order to understand a concept such as a ?fake gun?, we must first derive a class of FakeGunsfrom the class of Guns.
Thus the modified noun phrase must be an argument of the operator adjective.To this extent we claim that it is not generally possibly to represent the meaning of an operator adjectivewithin the context of an OWL ontology.
Instead, following Bankston (Bankston, 2003), we claim that thereference of an operator adjective must be a higher order predicate.
If we assume that there are operatorsof the form of a function, then the argument of an operator is the attributed noun phrase.
As such, weintroduce a frame operator attributive, that has one argument which is the noun.
Thus we understandthat the interpretation of ?fake gun?
is by means of an operator fake, which is a function that takesa class and produces a new class, i.e., [fake(Gun)](X).
Capturing such an operator lies beyond theexpressivity of first-order logic.
To fully capture the semantics of such an operator adjective, formalismsbeyond first-order logic are thus clearly needed.3.4 Object-relational adjectivesObject-relational adjectives are those that require a second argument, such as ?known?, which can onlybe understood as being ?known?
to some person, in comparison to ?famous?.
Thus, the modelling of therelational adjective known is quite similar to the semantics of the corresponding verb know.
It can bemodelled for instance via the frame ?X is known to Y ?
and reference foaf:knows as:8For example, some of the subsets Car are: CrewDormCar, GalleryCar, MotorRailcar, FreightCar, BoxCar,RefrigeratorCar, FiveWellStackCar, and more.205lexicon:known a lemon:LexicalEntry ;lemon:canonicalForm known:Lemma ;lemon:sense known:Sense ;lemon:synBehavior known:Frame .known:Lemma lemon:writtenRep "known"@eng .known:Frame lexinfo:attributeArg known:Subject ;lexinfo:prepositionalObject known:Object .known:Sense lemon:reference foaf:knows ;lemon:subjOfProp known:Subject ;lemon:objOfProp known:Object .known:Object lemon:marker lexicon:to .4 Adjectives in question answeringIn this section we empirically analyze the adequacy of the modelling proposed in this paper with respectto the QALD-49dataset, a shared dataset for Question Answering over Linked Data.
The 250 trainingand test questions of the QALD-4 benchmark contain 76 adjectives in total (not counting adjectives innames such as ?Mean Hamster Software?
).18 of the occurring adjectives do not have a semantic contribution w.r.t.
the underlying DBpediaontology, or at least none that is separable from the noun, as exemplified in the noun phrases in (13) and(14).1013.
(a) [[official website]] = dbo:website(b) [[national anthem]] = dbo:anthem14.
(a) [[official languages]] = dbo:officialLanguages(b) [[military conflicts]] = dbo:battleOtherwise, the most common kinds of adjectives among them are gradable (27) and intersective (13)adjectives.All intersective adjectives denote restriction classes that are not explicitely named in DBpedia, incorrespondence with the modelling proposed in Section 3.1 above, for example:15.
(a) [[Danish]] = ?dbo:country .res:Denmark(b) [[female]] = ?dbo:gender .res:Female(c) [[Methodist]] = ?dbo:religion .res:MethodismIn some cases these intersectives have a context-dependent and highly ontology-specific meaning,often tightly interwoven with the meaning of the noun, as in the following examples:16.
(a) [[first president of the United States]] = ?dbo:office .
?1st President of the United States?
(b) [[first season]] = ?dbo:seasonNumber .
1All gradable adjectives that occur in the QALD-4 question set can be captured in terms of lemonOILSas CovariantScalar (e.g.
?high?)
or ContravariantScalar (e.g.
?young?)
(cf.
Section 3.2above), bound to a DBpedia datatype property (e.g.
elevation or birthDate).
The positive formof those adjectives only occurs in ?how (much)?
questions, denoting the property they are bound to, forexample:17.
(a) [[deep]] = dbo:depth in ?How deep is Lake Placid??
(b) [[tall]] = dbo:height in ?How tall is Michael Jordan??9http://www.sc.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/qald/10[[?]]
stands for ?denotes?
and the prefixes dbo and res abbreviate the DBpedia namespaceshttp://dbpedia.org/ontology/ and http://dbpedia.org/resource/, respectively.206The comparative form denotes the property they are bound to, together with an aggregation operation,usually a filter invoking a term of comparison that depends on whether the adjective is covariant orcontravariant.18.
(a) [[Which mountains are higher than the Nanga Parbat?]]
=SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {res:Nanga_Parbat dbo:elevation ?x .
?uri rdf:type dbo:Mountain .
?uri dbo:elevation ?y .FILTER (?y > ?x)}Finally, the superlative form denotes the property they are bound to, together with an aggregationoperation, usually an ordering with a cut-off of all results except the first one, as exemplified in (19).
Insome cases, the superlative property is already encoded in the ontology, e.g., in the case of the propertydbo:highestPlace.19.
[[What is the longest river?]]
=SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {?uri rdf:type dbo:River .
?uri dbo:length ?l .}
ORDER BY DESC(?l) OFFSET 0 LIMIT 1There are three instances of operator adjectives.
Examples are ?former?, as in 20, which does notrefer to an element in the DBpedia ontology but is instead a disambiguation clue in the given query, and?professional?, which refers to the property dbo:occupation, see 21.20.
[[the former Dutch queen Juliana]] = res:Juliana21.
[[professional surfer]] = ?dbo:occupation .res:SurfingFinally, there were 8 remaining adjectives totalling 15 occurrences, which do not correspond to mean-ing in an ontology, but instead are part of the discourse structure, each ?same?, ?other?.5 Related workThe categorization of adjectives in terms of formal semantics goes back to Montague (1970) andVendler (1968).
However, one of the most significant attempts to assign a formal meaning was car-ried out in the Mikrokosmos project (Raskin and Nirenburg, 1995).
The approach to adjective modellingin the Mikrokosmos provided one of the first computational implementations of a microtheory of adjec-tive meaning.
The modelling of adjectives presented in this paper is clearly inspired by the modellingof adjectives adopted in the Mikrokosmos project.
In particular, scalar adjectives in the Microkosmosproject are modeled by association with an attribute and a range, e.g., ?big?
is described as being >0.75(i.e., 75% of all known instances) on the size-attribute.
Still, these classifications do not clearlyseparate meaning and syntax and also require a separate modelling of comparatives and class-specificmeanings for many adjectives.Amoia and Gardent (2006) handled the problem of adjectives in the context of textual entailment.
Theyanalyzed 15 classes that show the subtle interaction between the semantic class (e.g., ?privative?)
and theissues of attributive/predicative use and gradability.
Abdullah and Frost (2005) focused on the modellingof privative adjectives by arguing that these adjectives modify the underlying set itself in a manner thatis naturally second-order.
Similarly, Partee (2003) proposed a limited second-order model by means ofthe ?head primary principle?
requiring that adjectives are interpreted within their context.
Bankston?sanalysis (2003), however, shows that the fundamental nature of many adjectives is higher-order, and pro-vides a very sophisticated formal representation framework for adjectives.
A more thorough discussionof non-gradable, non-intersective adjectives is given by Morzycki (2013a).
Bouillion and Viegas (1999)consider the case of the French adjective ?vieux?
(?old?
), which they interprete as selecting two differ-ent elements in the event structure of an attributed noun, that is whether the state, e.g., ?being a mayor?for ?mayor?, is considered old or the individual itself.
In this way, the introduction of two senses for?vieux?
is avoided, however it remains unclear if such reasoning introduces more complexity than the207extra senses.
In his analysis of adjectives, Larson (1998) suggests that many adjectives denote propertiesof events, rather than of simple heads or nouns (which does not fall very far from the statement, madeabove, that relational adjectives denote properties of kinds).
Pustejovsky (1992; 1991) and Lenci (2000)state that lexical and semantic decomposition can be achieved generatively, assigning to each lexical itema specific qualia structure.
For instance, in an expression like:22.
The round, heavy, wooden, inlaid magnifying glass?
?round?
represents the Formal role (giving indications of shape and dimensionality)?
?heavy?
and ?wooden?
related to the Constitutive role and indicate the relation between theobject and its parts (e. g. by specifying weight, material, parts and components)?
?inlaid?
is the Agentive role of the lexical item, denoting the factors that have been involved inthe generation of the objects, such as creator, artifact, natural kind, and causal chain?
?magnifying?
describes the Telic role of ?glass?, since it shows its purpose and functionFinally, Peters and Peters (2000) provide one of the few other practical reports on modelling adjectiveswith ontologies, in the context of the SIMPLE lexica.
This work is primarily focussed on the categoriza-tion of by means of intensional and extensional properties, rather than due to their logical modelling.6 ConclusionIn this paper we have proposed an approach to model the semantics of adjectives in the context of thelexicon-ontology interface with a focus on the ontology-lexicon model lemon.
We have argued that thesemantics of adjectives, in particular gradable and privative adjectives, is beyond what can be expressedin first-order logics, OWL in particular.
Instead, capturing the semantics of such adjectives requiresformalisms that are non-monotonic, second-order and can represent fuzzy concepts.
We have proposedan extension of lemon by the lemonOILS vocabulary that adds ?syntactic sugar?
that allows us to representthe semantics of adjectives in a way that abstracts from the actual representational formalism used.
Thiswork has been used in the construction of lexical resources to support a question answering system,and we found that this framework is sufficient to enable tractable computation of natural language toSPARQL mapping over at least a small but varied set of test questions used in the QALD evaluationtask.
Future work will show whether this model is scalable and applicable to most adjectives as well asdomains and natural languages.ReferencesNabil Abdullah and Richard A Frost.
