For exami)h; ~the correspondence between the.English word 'often' :rod the intuitively correspondingaa>nese word is not ebvhms.
This paper proposesa conceptual representat;ion to describe a wide rangeof linguistic phenomelul, which are rehtted to degreeconcepts in natural language.1 Int roduct ionDegree words in natural l;mguage, which are exempll-lied by the tbllowing, exist across p~rts of speech andacross specific languages.

S()llle interesting characteristics.First, quantities in the real workl which can be represented by degree words w~.ry pragmatically, dependingon speakers, situa.tions, etc.
(Fauconnier, 1.975).
Thismeans that degree words do not have denotations inthe rea,1 world.
IIowever, lllalty degreL' expressions areused in daily life and it; is not tblt thai, they are par-ticula.rly incomprehensil~le.
The authors do not thinkthaC to underst~md the lneanhtgs of degree words is tounderstan(\[ tit(; rea.l quantities in the real world.Second~ it is difficult to compare: degree words in dif-ferent languages, in the case of the English non-degreeword ~dog, ~ we may think that the word semanticallycorresponds to the ;lapanese word 'iml' because thesetwo words reli!r to ~he same object 'clog' in the realworld.
However, this correspondence is not true of de-gree words.
Tim English woM %ften' intuitively cor-responds to Lit('.
Japanese word %hitmshib% ~but thiscorrespondence is not ol)vious.
'Fhat is because thesewords do not have.
denota.tions in the real world.These chttra.cteristics a, re related to the b~vse of Ma-chine Tr~tnslation and its dietionaries.
Even when thereal quantity, which is reti?rred to by ~t degree word in~t ext, is not clearly understood, it is usually believedthat it is possible to translate the word into ~tnotherlanguage.
When building bi-lingual dictiomtries, it isnecessary to consider the correspondence b tween (lmgree words in each htnguage.
A new reference frame-work is needed by which to investigate to what extentthe two words correspond to each other.
These issuesare.
also related to conceptual descriptions in btrge scaleknowledge l)aae projects, wlfieh have started recently.Third, degree words tuwe some ch~racteristics whichare indepelMent from in~rts of speech.
One of the phe-nomena degree words have in comnlon is modificationrestrictions between degree words and rlegree intensi.-tiers.
Each degree word ha.s its own modification re-striction (Bolinger, 1972; Quirk, 1985; Kamei, 1988,1990).
For example, %IP and qm ~ can be modifiedby 'Minos(,' but 'tall,' 'short,' hnany~' and 'few' can-not usually be so h~mdled.
On the other hand, %all,'%hort,' many,' and 'ihw' rail be modified by ~ve.ry,' but'all' a,nd %0' cannot.
'Some' trod 'sometimes' cannotbe modified by either %ery' or ~ahnost.
'Previous researchers pointed out a lot of importantlinguistic phenonmna~ which ~re related to degree wordsbut, the issues described abow ~.
were left uninw~stigated.Barwise trod Cooper (1981) investigate relations I)c~taween determiners in English and ge,mrMized quantl-tiers in logic.
Howew.
'r, they did not focus so much ondegree words, such ~s ~tdjeetiw'.s and adverbs in gen-eral.
it is still undetermined how to fully comprehendsuch words as 'ma.ny' and % i'ew.'
Oazdar (1979) andIIirsehberg (1985) introduced ideas of a linear orderingof degree words and treated ~ wide range of phenom-elut related to degree words.
However, they directlyhtmrlled real words and treated ~positive words ~ suchas %11' and hnany,' ~nd qmgative words ~ such as flew'and %o ~ separ~ttely.
Relations between the positive andnegative words were not clear.
In order to con,prehendthese, unsolwM linguistic phenomena~ the authors pro-pose a semantic model of degree, concepts.7752 D isc re te  Degree  Pr imi t ivesand a List Express ionThis section introduces discrete degree priinitives anda list expression 'co represent mea.nings of degree con-cepts.
From the perspective of quantities in the realworld, hnany' and 'some' are sfmilar.
However, Themodification restriction be.tween degree words and de-gree intensifier shows that e~mh word is normally mod-ified by intensifiers electively.
This suggests the exis-tence of DISCILETE degree concept primitives, whichare independent from parts of speech.
The authorsintroduce five basic semantic primitives (~A,' ~M,' ~S ,''F,'  and 'N') indicating degree that are abstracted fromthe meanings of %.11,' hnany,' some,' ~fcw,' and ;no.'
Alist of degree primitives is used to describe meaningsof degree words in terms of relative positions in the listexpression.
{A, M, S, l>, N}The list expression above is a basic list of the discretemodel.
The ,utthors divide meanings of degree wordsinte two parl;s. For example, 'tall' and %hort' can bedivided into the semantic axis regarding 'tallness' andthe degree concepts 'many (much)' ~md 'few (little).
'Tables 2 and 3 represent the htter  part of meanings ofdegree words.
In these lists, ' - '  means that the valuein that pa.rtict,la.r position is lacking.Table 1: List Examples (1)Basic list {A, M, S, F, N}~dl, always {A, - ,  - ,  - ,  --}many, often { - ,  M, - ,  - ,  -- }some, sometimes {- ,  - ,  S, - ,  -}few, seldonl { .

It istrue that quantities in the real world, which are ex-pressed by degree words, are continuous, tIow('.ver, theauthors think that language treats degree concepts ina discrete way.
T~d)le 3 shows modificatiou restrictionson degree intensifiers using the primitives.
In this ta-ble, % '  shows that the intensifiers can lnodify the (le-gree primitives, and ' - '  shows the intensifiers cannotmodify the prinfitives.
Note that these primitives arenot real words and that they consistently describe re-lationships that are independent from parts of speech.These are important differences between this modeland previous research reports.Table 3: Modification Restriction of Degree Prinfitivesand IntensifiersIntensifiersBoosterCompromlserl)iminisherApproximatorMaximizerExamplesvery, extremelypretty, somewhata little, slightlyahnost~ nearlyabsolutelyDegree  Pr imi t ivesA M S P N- + - + -- + - + -- + - + -+ ++ +3 A Dua l  List Express ion  of  De-gree ConceptIt is pointed out that degree words convey non-literal'conversational' meanings when they are used.
The digference between a literati meaning and a converst~tionalmeaning is called 'CouversationM Imf)licature' (Grice,1967).
This section explains how this model treats thisaspect of degree concepts.3.1  Quest ion  and  Answer(17o exemplify Conversational Implicature, let us con-sider the following sentence, which includes a number.
(3) I solved three of the problems.A natural interpretation of this sentence i s "I solvedjust three of the prol)lems, not all or four or two orone or none of them."
Kowever, in a logical way, thisstatement is true, when "I solved FOUR of them."
Forexample, if the border line between success and failureof a test is three, this sentence is naturally spoken, evenwhen, in fact, the person solved four of the i)roblems(Chomsky, 1972; Ota, 1980; Ikeuehi, 1985).
The fol-lowing is a Yes/No question corresponding to sentence(3) and its answers.
Interestingly, both of the answersbelow are possible in this case.
(4) A: Did you solve three of the problems ?B: - Yes, in fact i solved four.- No, I solved four.In order to handle these phenomena, more complexstates than just 'three' for the meaning of the nu,nberthre.e are needed.
The authors think that five statesare a.ctually needed fbr clarity: (1) All problems aresolved.
(2) The mmlber of solwxl problems exceedsthe number which aI)pears in the sentence (=three inthis case).
(3) The number of solved problems is ex-actly the number which appears.
(4) The number of776solved problems does not total tilt: mnnber which ap-pears.
(5) No l)roblenls are solved.
The authors intro-duce the five primitives, 'A,' '>n\ ]  ~: 1 h' ' In , '  and 'N,'corresponding t/) these five states, respec.tively.
A listexpression is introduced as follow.

Sentence(7) is a negative smite,we which correslmnds to sen-tence (3).
A negative sentence like this tuus several in-terpretations which previous research as pointed outbut has not been able to treat satisNctorily.
Thismodel calculates all the possible interpretations of anegative sentence fi'om the representation f the origi-na.l Mlirmative sentenc.e.
(7) 1 didn't solve three of tile problems.One possible interpretation of sentence (7) is thatthere ~rc three problems that "i (lid uot solve" (Inter-pretation A).
In tllis interprets.lion, the n/tmber %hree ~is not under the influence of the negation; the numberin out of the scope of negation.

This i,~terpretation f the negativesentence is consistent with the negations of both thedirect meaning and the possible implic~tion.

This interpretation usually im-plies that there are some solved problems.
This meansthe negation usually does not deny the.
existence of tilesolw~d prol)lems, ttowever, in a logical way, no prob-lem being solved is a possible situation.
Step 3 realizesthis condition.

This means that the interpreta-tion is consistent with only the negation of tile directmeaning, and does not satisfy the negation of the pos-sibh."

Step 2 realizes this condition.
Thisexemplifies that the Conversational Implicature can becanceled.
In speech~ stress is put on THREE and ALLin this interpret,~tion, and this linguistic phenomenonis accounted for in Step 2.4 Negat ion  of Degree  Expres-sions in Natura l  LanguageIn this section~ the dual list representation a d the op-erations introduced in the previous ection are appliedto degree words other than numbers.4.1 'All,' ~no,' ~some,' and ~not all'Here, we will apply the same model to the relationsbetween 'all/~some~' 'no,' and blot all' in natural an-guage.
Sentence (10-1) logically entails sentence (10-2).
Sentence (10-2) usually implies senteuce (10-3).Itowever, sentence (10-3) contradicts the original sell-fence (10~1).
A careless mixture of logical implicationand usmd implication in language makes the inferenceof (10-3) from (10-1) unreasonable (t-Iorn, 1972; Ota,1980; McCawley 1981).
(10-1) All students are intelligeut.
(10-2) Some students are intelligent.
(10-3) Some students are NOT intelligent.The discrete model is ~ usethl tool for describingthese relations.
List (11) is used to express relations1)etween 'all,' 'some,' 'no,' ~tnd 'not all (= some ...not).'
In this case, only three primitives are used.
(H) {a, s, N}In this list, the w~lue ~S' corresponds to the statewherein there are SOME students who are intelligentand SOME other students who are NOT intelligent.The me,~nings of these words are also expressed with adual list.

Instead~ the authors clMm thatpeople comprehend degree concepts in a discrete way,and that degree concepts are identified by their rela-tlw~ positions in the fl'amework of understanding.

However,sentence (13) shows th~tt 'several' means more thanone in this case.
Previous researchers have not beensuccessflfl in describing the diflhrence between 'sevend'and 'a few.'
The authors think that 'sew.
'ral' shouldbe in a list including 'several' and 'one,' while 'a few'should be in a list which contains 'a few' ~tnd 'many.
''Several' implies 'not one,' while '~ few' implies 'notmany.'
An important point is that the ditference be-tween 'several' and ~a few' is not the exact quantityinvolved, but a framework of understanding, that is,the set of vahms in the lists and their relative posi-tions.4.3 'OR'  in Natura l  Language andNegat ionIt has been shown that the logical operator ~OR'has characteristics similar to degree concepts (Gazdar,1979).
This is because 'o f  in natural anguage gener-ally has two interpretations, the 'inclusive or' and the'exclusiw'.
or.'
This section applies the same model fordegree concepts to a logical operator 'OIL' and 'or' innatural anguage.It is difficult to conceptualize the ne.gation of 'or' innatural anguage, in a usual sense, although negationof 'and' is easy.
Logically, however, the negation of thelogical operation 'OR' (that is, 'Inclusive or') is 'NOR.
'However, in a sense in natured language, 'AND' insteadof 'NOR' can also be a negation of 'Oil..'and or nor{ (+ +), (+-4 -+) ,  ( -  -)  }( ( - - , (+- /  +) , :}Exc .
