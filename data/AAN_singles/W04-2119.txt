Application Adaptive Electronic Dictionary with Intelligent InterfaceSvetlana SheremetyevaCopenhagen Business School,LanA ConsultingMadvigs Alle, 9, 2Copenhagen, Denmark, DK-1829lanaconsult@mail.dkAbstractThe paper presents an electronic dictionarythat can be adapted to the needs of differentNLP applications.
It suggests some ways tosave on software customisation andacquisition effort through an intelligentdeveloper interface.
The emphasis is made onthe flexibility of data representation, handlingand access speed.1 IntroductionIn this paper we try to contribute to the problemof electronic dictionaries with a case study, -TransDict, - a multilingual lexicon for a family ofpatent-related NLP applications, such as AutoPat,APTrans and AutoRead1.
TransDict thus conformsto the ?Multilingual-Specialized?
dictionaryparadigm (S?rasset, 1993), but it can also be usedas a stand alone tool and adapted for otherlanguage related tasks, e.g., training computationallinguists.The motivation to focuse on application tuneddictionaries is that though developing reusable full-sized knowledge bases for NLP systems is highlydesirable this process is extremely expensive andtime consuming, and  reusability is not guaranteed.If an NLP system uses a restricted sublanguage,and, thus, can operate with smaller-scaledictionaries, the scope of acquisition anddevelopment effort will decrease correspondingly.Dictionary software should be adaptable to thespecificity of sublanguages.The languages that are currently covered areEnglish and Danish but TransDict can easily beextended to a multiple number of other languages.TransDict features a powerful environment foracquisition, editing, browsing, defaulting andcoherence checking.
It is implemented in C++ asan integral part of 32-bit Windows applications forWindows 95/98/2000/NT.1AutoPat, APTrans, AutoRead, - computer systemsfor authoring, translation and improving readability ofpaten claims, correspondingly (Sheremetyeva, 2003)2 Related workA vast amount of research in the field ofelectronic dictionaries concentrate on dataunification, representation, organization andmanagement with the major focus onmultilingual dictionaries as, for example, in(Wong, 2000; Boitet et al,2002).Multilingual electronic dictionaries ofteninclude a database of cross-referenced unilingualdictionaries with the use of interlingua such asontology (Onyshkevich and Nirenburg, 1994))or a pivotal language (Boitet et al,cf.
).The architecture of such dictionaries normallyinclude a lexical database and a set of tools fordata management, - visualisers, editors,defaulters, etc.
(Khatchadourian, 1992).
Auser-friendly interface is one of the major issuesstill uderdeveloped (Bilac and Zock, 2003).XML and SGML data representationlanguages (Boitet et al, cf.)
have been asuccessful approach to facilitate the export ofelectronic dictionaries to different applicationsthough many dictionaries use their own internaldata representation formats (Fedder, 1992).Finally, it is desirable for electronicdictionaries to be stand-alone modules withdefined interfaces for interaction with otherlinguistic applications (Pointer project report,http://www.computing.surrey.ac.uk/ai/pointer).3 Overview of TransDict3.1 Feature spaceTransDict is originally built over a set of featuresrelevant for the patent  applications including:Semantic features: SEM_Cl - semantic class,CASE_ROLEs, - a set of case-roles associatedwith a lexeme, if any).Syntactic features: FILLERs, - sets of mostprobable fillers of case-roles in terms of types ofphrases and lexical preferences.Linking features: PATTERNs, - linearizationpatterns of lexemes that code both the knowledgeabout co-occurrences of lexemes with their case-roles and the knowledge about their linear order.Figure 1.
An overall architecture of TransDict.Morphological features: POS, - part of speech,MORPH, - wordforms, number, gender, etc.
; thesets of parts of speech and wordforms are domainand application specific (Sheremetyeva, cf.
).Rank feature: RANK, - corpus-based frequencywithin one semantic class.
The more frequent is alexeme, the less its rank.3.2 Organization and architectureTransDict includes cross-referencedmonolingual lexicons for every language.
Amonolingual dictionary consists of a set of entries.An entry identifies lexical information for onemeaning of a lexeme of a given language.
Everyentry is maximally defined as a tree of features:SEM-CL[Language[POS RANK[MORPH CASE_ROLE  FILLER  PATTERN]The CASE_ROLE , FILLER and  PATTERNfeatures might not be specified in certain entries,e.g., for nouns-physical objects.A maximal entry has the following fields:entry::=semantics SEM_CLlanguage LANGUAGEpart of speech POSmajor-form string TAGother-forms {string TAG}+case-frame {CASE_ROLE}+filler {CASE_ROLE{FILLER}+}+patterns {PATTERN}+frequency  RANKtranslation{cross-linguistic equivalent entryindex}+TAG is a label to code several features: POS,number, inflection type and semantic class:object, event, etc., providing for powerful tagging.The architecture of TransDict is shown inFigure 1.
All information is stored in TransDictinternal formats: in data files and index files.
Thedeveloper works with the Main Dictionary File(MDF) visualised by the interface (Figure 2).Figure 2.
A screenshot of the TransDict interface displaying the entry for the lexeme ?connected?When the lexicographer saves the data multipleextractions from MDF are automatically created.These extractions contain different data subsetsrelevant for different processing steps (tagging,disambiguation, transfer and generation).
Theextractions are created for every language and forevery pair of languages.
They are linked toapplications by special DLL (dynamic linklibrary) functions that access only one of thedictionary extractions for every processing step.This approach gives a significant increase inaccess speed and processing, which is crucial forreal world systems.
This and the fact thatTransDict is implemented for PC motivated ourchoice not to use the SQL database and XML(which would have slowed down the applicationperformance).
It does not mean, however, thatTransDict could not be used in the on-line regime.An interface and a dll can be written for thispurpose.4 Supporting toolsWe developed the following TransDict tools:Data importer/merger imports wordlists and/orfeature values from external files and applications.For example, the tool is pipelined to a tagger andto AutoPat and AutoTrans user interfaces, toautomatically import unknown words.Defaulter automatically assignes entrystructures and some of feature values to entries.Editor a) edits feature values in an entry and b)edits dictionary settings, - languages, semanticclasses, parts of speech, wordforms and their tags.Any change of settings automatically propagatesto corresponding entries.Morphological generator automaticallygenerates wordforms for a given word base form.Content and format checker reveals incompleteand/or bad formatted entries.Look-up tool performs wild card search andsearch on any combination of specifiedparameters.5  Interface designA lexicographer interacts with the lexicon by anextemely user-friendly interface (Figure2).
Theleft pane of the interface screen contains ascrollable list of lexeme base forms2 in a selectedlanguage.
A click on a language bookmark over2For convenience other wordforms are not includedin this list but can be displayed on mouse click.Figure 3.
A fragment of English and Danishequivalent entries as shown in the interface.the morphological zone displays an entry in theselected language equivalent to a highlightedword in the left column.
All supporting tools areaccessed  through the interface menus.The ?Add?
button calls pop-up menus wherethe developer is prompted to select a semanticclass and part-of speech.
This done, an entry witha relevant structure, tags and default values willbe displayed.
After the user types in a base formall other wordforms are automatically generatedon mouse click.
The developer is to review thedefault knowledge and edit it if necessary.
Thecontent and format checker take care of correctdescriptions with different kinds of alert messagesand rewriting support.
Powerful search can bedone both in a look-up and edit mode.Changing the dictionary settings can easilychange a base form status of a  wordform, thestructure of the entry and other specificationparameters.
Figure 3 shows how the default nounentry with two slots for its morphological forms:singular and plural, is reset for Danish wheredefiniteness is expressed morphologically, thusduplicating the number of members of the nounparadigm compared with English.6 ConclusionIn this paper we described an on-going projecton developing a multilingual electronicdictionary, - TransDict, integrated with patentdomain applications.
We focused on such effortsaving strategies as knowledge organization,access, reusability, support tools and interfacedesign.
As of now (April 2004) the dictionaryprogram including intelligent application adaptiveinterface integrated with supporting tools andexternal applications, - AutoPat, AutoTrans,AutoRead (Sheremetyeva, cf.)
is fullyimplemented and tested.
This ?shell?
can now beused to create any number of dictionaries withdifferent feature spaces.The TransDict patent domain knowledge basecurrently contains about 60,000 completedEnglish entries and around 100 equivalent Danishentries that are directly used in testing analysis,transfer and generation modules for the English-Danish machine translation system.
We plan toincrease the English-Danish knowledge base to aproduct size level by December 2004.TransDict (with patent domain or otherknowledge) can be used as a stand-alone tool, forother applications e.g., for training computationallinguists.ReferencesS.Bilac and M.Zock.
