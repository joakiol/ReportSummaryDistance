Proceedings of HLT/EMNLP 2005 Demonstration Abstracts, pages 8?9,Vancouver, October 2005.MindNet: an automatically-created lexical resourceLucy Vanderwende, Gary Kacmarcik, Hisami Suzuki, Arul MenezesMicrosoft ResearchRedmond, WA 98052, USA{lucyv, garykac, hisamis, arulm}@microsoft.comAbstractWe will demonstrate MindNet, a lexical resourcebuilt automatically by processing text.
We willpresent two forms of MindNet: as a static lexicalresource, and, as a toolkit which allows MindNetsto be built from arbitrary text.
We will also intro-duce a web-based interface to MindNet lexicons(MNEX) that is intended to make the data con-tained within MindNets more accessible for explo-ration.
Both English and Japanese MindNets willbe shown and will be made available, throughMNEX, for research purposes.1 MindNetA MindNet is a collection of semantic relationsthat is automatically extracted from text data usinga broad coverage parser.
Previous publications onMindNet (Suzuki et al, 2005, Richardson et al,1998, Vanderwende 1995) have focused on theeffort required to build a MindNet from the datacontained in Japanese and English lexicons.Semantic RelationsThe semantic relations that are stored in MindNetare directed, labeled relationships between twowords; see Table 1:Attributive Manner SourceCause Means SynonymGoal Part TimeHypernym Possessor TypicalObjectLocation Result TypicalSubjectTable 1: A sampling of the semantic relations stored inMindNetThese semantic relations are obtained from theLogical Form analysis of our broad coverageparser NLPwin (Heidorn, 2000).
The LogicalForm is a labeled dependency analysis with func-tion words removed.
We have not completed anevaluation of the quality of the extracted semanticrelations.
Anecdotally, however, the quality variesaccording to the relation type, with Hypernym andgrammatical relations TypicalSubject and Typi-calObj being reliable, while relations such as Partand Purpose are less reliable.
By making MindNetavailable, we solicit feedback on the utility of theselabeled relationships, especially in contrast to sim-ple co-occurrence statistics and to the heavily usedhypernymy and synonymy links.
Furthermore, wesolicit feedback on the level of accuracy which istolerable for specific applications.Semantic Relation StructuresWe refer to the hierarchical collection of semanticrelations (semrels) that are automatically extractedfrom a source sentence as a semrel structure.
Eachsemrel structure contains all of the semrels ex-tracted from a single source sentence.
A semrelstructure can be viewed from the perspective ofeach unique word that occurs in the structure; wecall these inverted structures.
They contain thesame information as the original, but with a differ-ent word placed at the root of the structure.
An ex-ample semrel structure for the definition ofswallow is given in Figure 1a, and its inversion,from the perspective of wing is given in Figure 1b:swallow           wingHyp bird           PartOf birdPart wing             Attrib smallAttrib small          HypOf swallowFigure 1a and b: Figure 1a is the semrel structure for thedefinition of swallow1, Figure 1b the inversion on wing.2 MNEXMNEX (MindNet Explorer) is the web-based inter-face to MindNet that is designed to facilitatebrowsing MindNet structure and relations.
MNEXdisplays paths based on the word or words that the1Swallow: a small bird with wings (LDOCE).
Definitionabbreviated for purposes of exposition.8user enters.
A path is a set of links that connect oneword to another within either a single semrel struc-ture or by combining fragments from multiplesemrel structures.
Paths are weighted for compari-son (Richardson, 1997).
Currently, either one ortwo words can be specified and we allow somerestrictions to refine the path search.
A user canrestrict the intended part of speech of the wordsentered, and/or the user can restrict the paths toinclude only the specified relation.
When twowords are provided, the UI returns a list of thehighest ranked paths between those two words.When only one word is given, then all paths fromthat word are ranked and displayed.
Figure 2shows the MNEX interface, and a query requestingall paths from the word bird, restricted to Nounpart of speech, through the Part relation:Figure 2: MNEX output for ?bird (Noun) Part?
query3 Relation to other workFor English, WordNet is the most widely usedknowledgebase.
Aside from being English-only,this database was hand-coded and significant effortis required to create similar databases for differentdomains and languages.
Projects like EuroWord-Net address the monolingual aspect of WordNet,but these databases are still labor intensive to cre-ate.
On the other hand, the quality of the informa-tion contained in a WordNet (Fellbaum et al,1998) is very reliable, exactly because it wasmanually created.
FrameNet (Baker et al, 1998)and OpenCyc are other valuable resources for Eng-lish, also hand-created, that contain a rich set ofrelations between words and concepts.
Their use isstill being explored as they have been made avail-able only recently.
For Japanese, there are alsoconcept dictionaries providing semantic relations,similarly hand-created, e.g., EDR and NihongoGoi-taikei (NTT).The demonstration of MindNet will highlightthat this resource is automatically created, allowingdomain lexical resources to be built quickly, albeitwith lesser accuracy.
We are confident that this isa trade-off worth making in many cases, and en-courage experimentation in this area.
MNEX al-lows the exploration of the rich set of relationsthrough which paths connecting words are linked.4 ReferencesBaker, Collin F., Fillmore, Charles J., and Lowe, JohnB.
