M?rovsk?Charles University in Prague                         Charles University in PragueFaculty of Arts                                Faculty of Mathematics and Physics[magdalena.rysova@post.cz]                                [mirovsky@ufal.mff.cuni.cz]AbstractThe paper introduces a possibility of new research offered by a multi-dimensional annotation ofthe Prague Dependency Treebank.
It focuses on exploitation of the annotation of coreference forthe annotation of discourse relations expressed by multiword expressions.
It tries to find which as-pect interlinks these linguistic areas and how we can use this interplay in automatic searching forCzech expressions like despite this (navzdory tomu), because of this fact (d?ky t?to skute?nosti)functioning as multiword discourse markers.1 IntroductionThe aim of the paper is to introduce possibilities of interplay between two linguistic phenomena ?
dis-course1 and coreference relations ?
annotated in the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT).
The paperdemonstrates how the annotation of coreference relations (finished in 2011) may facilitate automaticsearching for alternative lexicalizations of discourse connectives like due to this fact (kv?li t?to skute?nos-ti), in addition to this (krom?
toho) in the corpus that offers annotation of several linguistic phenomena atonce.
In other words, the paper tries to show how we can build on existing annotation of coreference toimprove another level of annotation ?
discourse.1.1 Annotation of Discourse Relations in the Prague Dependency TreebankThe Prague Dependency Treebank is a corpus of almost 50 thousand sentences of Czech journalistic textsthat offers linguistic data manually annotated on three layers ?
it interlinks morphological, syntactic andcomplex semantic (or tectogrammatic) annotation (Haji?
et al., 2006, Bej?ek et al., 2012).
For the seman-tic layer of PDT, there also exists annotation of coreference (Nedoluzhko et al., 2011), and discourse (asthe only annotated corpus of Czech; see Pol?kov?
et al., 2012a).Discourse relations are marked between two verbal arguments (i.e.
two relevant parts of text) if they aresignalled by a certain discourse marker ?
see an example from PDT:(1) The mattress was terrible, no quality at first sight.However, he did not care.
(In original: [Matrace] byla na prvn?
pohled stra?n?, nekvalitn?.
On na to ale v?bec nedbal.

as text relations between sentences (verbal arguments).
Coreferenceis here used as an umbrella term for grammatical and textual coreference and bridging relations expressed in section 4.
Althoughbridging relations differ from coreference in traditional sense, as they express an indirect relation based on association, we use thegeneral term coreference in the text for better transparency.added by the organizers.
License details: http://reativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/Page numbers and proceedings footer are11In this example, there are two verbal arguments: the first is the mattress was terrible, no quality at firstsight ([matrace] byla na prvn?
pohled stra?n?, nekvalitn?)
and the second he did not care (on na to alev?bec nedbal).
Between these two arguments, there is a discourse relation of opposition signalled by theconjunction however (ale).
Therefore, in this case, however (ale) has a function of discourse marker.In the first phase of discourse annotation (see the Prague Discourse Treebank 1.0, Pol?kov?
et al.,2012a), only discourse relations (between verbal arguments) introduced by explicit connectives have beencaptured.
Explicit connectives are understood as closed class expressions with connecting function at thelevel of discourse description (see Pol?kov?
et al., 2012b) belonging among certain parts of speech ?
es-pecially conjunctions (therefore, however, or ?
proto, a?koli, nebo), adverbs (then, afterwards ?
potom,pak) and particles (mainly rhematizers as too, only ?
tak?, jen).However, during annotation, there occurred also other expressions exactly with the same connectingfunction that differed from connectives in both lexical and syntactic aspect.
These expressions were calledalternative lexicalizations of discourse connectives (shortly AltLexes) in the Penn Discourse Treebank2(see Prasad et al., 2010); their examples are this is the reason why (to je d?vod, pro?
), due to this fact(kv?li tomu) etc.
In some cases, explicit discourse connectives and their alternative lexicalizations are eveninterchangeable ?
see an example from PDT:(2) Almost every mined diamond has a quality of a jewel.This is the reason why such an expensive output from the sea is worth for the company.
(In original: T?m??
ka?d?
vyt??en?
diamant m?
kvalitu drahokamu.To je d?vod, pro?
se tak n?kladn?
t?
?ba z mo?e firm?
vypl?c?.
)In this example, there is an AltLex this is the reason why (to je d?vod, pro?)
signalling a discourse relationof reason and result.
This AltLex is replaceable by the connective therefore and the meaning remains ex-actly the same.The example demonstrates that a complete discourse annotation should contain also relations expressedby AltLexes.
Therefore, a detailed research on AltLexes is useful and needed.
In this respect, the presentpaper tries to demonstrate how the new instances of Czech AltLexes may be automatically found in thePrague Dependency Treebank on the basis of the already finished coreference annotation.2 Alternative Lexicalizations of Discourse Connectives in PDTAlternative lexicalizations of discourse connectives were firstly described in detail for English (see Prasadet al., 2010).
English AltLexes were examined from the lexico-syntactic and semantic point of view.
Simi-lar analysis has been made also for Czech (see Rysov?, 2012a) ?
the research was carried out on the basisof the annotated data from PDT.In the first stage of discourse annotation in PDT (i.e.
annotation of Czech data), the annotators (trainedstudents of linguistics) were asked to fill a comment ?AltLex?
to such expressions that function in the text,according to their interpretation, as Czech AltLexes.
The aim of the first stage (regarding the AltLexes)was to collect an adequate sample of material that allowed the preliminary analysis of Czech AltLexes(see Rysov?, 2012a).Altogether, PDT contains 49,431 sentences with the annotation of discourse.
Within them, there were306 expressions (or tokens) with the annotators?
comment ?AltLex?.
This number seems to be rather low.However, the annotators did not mark all instances of AltLexes ?
in the first stage, the aim was not a finaland complete annotation (as Czech AltLexes are a new and uninvestigated topic) but a collection of mate-rial for further research.
So for example, we found out that the Czech AltLex because of (d?ky) appears inPDT in 14 instances although firstly, it was marked in the annotators?
comment just in one case.2 The terms AltLex?s and explicit discourse connectives are used in the Prague Dependency Treebank and Penn Discourse Tree-bank not fully identically.
For example, Penn Discourse Treebank captures prepositional phrases as connectives whereas PragueDependency Treebank as AltLex?s etc.
However, both understand connectives as closed class expressions and AltLex?s as openclass expressions with connecting function at the level of discourse.12Therefore, it is obvious that the preliminary number 306 of Czech AltLexes will considerably grow andthat in the following stage of annotation, it is necessary to search for Czech AltLexes more systematically.3 A Specific Group of Czech AltLexes: Preposition + an Anaphoric ExpressionOn the basis of the 306 tokens gained from the first stage of annotation, there was created a preparatorylist of Czech AltLexes (see Rysov?, 2012b).
It appeared that one significant group of them is formed byCzech prepositions followed by an anaphoric expression referring to the previous argument.
These areexpressions like because of this (kv?li tomu), due to this fact (d?ky t?to skute?nosti), despite this situation(navzdory t?to situaci) etc.
?
see an example from PDT:(3) President Fernando Collor probably hoarded millions to his own pocket.Because of this, he is supposed to fail.
(In original: Prezident Fernando Collor si ?dajn?
nahrabal do vlastn?
kapsy mili?ny.Kv?li tomu pravd?podobn?
padne.
)In the example, there is a discourse relation of reason and result introduced by the AltLex because of this(kv?li tomu) that is replaceable by the connective therefore (proto) in this case.In this group of AltLexes, it is the preposition that carries the core of lexical meaning as well as theproperty of being an AltLex (see Rysov?, 2012b).
It means that the preposition carries the informationabout the type of the discourse relation ?
e.g.
the example (3) demonstrates that it is the expression be-cause of (kv?li) that signals a relation of reason and result and therefore the preposition is also the fixedpart of the AltLex.
At the same time, the preposition obligatorily combines with an anaphoric referencethat may vary ?
in the example (3), it is the pronoun this (tomu) but it is variable with other anaphoric ex-pressions, so there are such variants of AltLexes like because of this / this fact / this situation (d?ky tomu /t?to skute?nosti / t?to situaci) etc.Other examples of prepositions (meant in the Czech originals ?
see Kroupov?, 1984) from this group ofAltLexes are in addition to (krom?
), due to (kv?li), unlike (na rozd?l od), on the basis of (na z?klad?
), de-spite (navzdory), in spite of (p?es), due to (vinou), considering (vzhledem k).As said above, these types of AltLexes must combine with some complementation due to their valency.Therefore, it is impossible to use, for example, *because of, I will do it (*kv?li to ud?l?m), but only be-cause of this, I will do it (kv?li tomu to ud?l?m).
So if there is some obligatory complementation, i.e.
ageneral rule in all of these AltLexes, we may use this information for their automatic searching.Moreover, all of these prepositions function as AltLexes only if they combine with some anaphoric ex-pression referring to the previous argument.
If they occur with a non-anaphoric expression, they are notAltLexes, like in this example:(4) I was ill a whole month.I could not sleep due to cough at night.
(In original: Marodila jsem cel?
m?s?c.V noci jsem nemohla sp?t kv?li ka?li.
)It is obvious that the expression due to cough (kv?li ka?li) from the second sentence does not refer to anypart of the previous one and that it does not signal any discourse relation between the two sentences.
Onthe contrary, there is the following example of the same preposition with anaphoric reference functioningas AltLex:(5) Italy saves.Because of this, some journals will no longer come out.13Figure 1.
An example of a textual coreference with a noun as the antecedent.
(In original: It?lie ?et?
?.Kv?li tomu tam p?estanou vych?zet n?kter?
den?ky.
)In this example, the whole expression because of this (kv?li tomu) introduces a discourse relation of rea-son and result between the two arguments.
We may replace it, for example, by the connective therefore(proto).It is obvious that combination of prepositions as due to (kv?li), because of (d?ky) with an anaphoric ref-erence is, for them, a condition for being AltLex.
This condition may be well used especially in corporawith annotated coreference as the Prague Dependency Treebank.4 Annotation of Coreference in PDT and Its Use for Discourse4.1 Types of CoreferenceAnnotation of coreference in PDT was finished in 2011 (cf.
Nedoluzhko et al., 2011).
The annotated rela-tions are divided into four groups: a) grammatical coreference ?
mostly inter-sentential coreference deriv-able using Czech grammatical rules (the vertical arrow in Fig.
1); b) textual coreference ?
inter- and intra-sentential coreference of pronouns and nouns derivable only from the sentence meaning (the horizontalarrows in Fig.
1); c) bridging anaphora ?
inter- and intra-sentential relations such as part-whole, subset-set, function etc.
; d) special types of reference (exophora ?
referring to elements outside the text, and seg-ment ?
referring to an unspecified larger part of the preceeding context) (see Nedoluzhko, 2011).4.2 AltLexes ?
Coreference Leading to the Verbal ArgumentAs said in the section 3, there is one group of Czech AltLexes functioning as discourse markers only incombination with some anaphoric expression.
The second condition is that this anaphoric expression mustrefer to a (whole) verbal argument.
PDT captures it in the tree structure with the highest verbal node rep-resenting the whole argument (discourse relations are realized by thick orange arrows leading betweentwo verbal nodes symbolising the two arguments).3 It means that when searching for tokens from thisgroup of AltLexes, we may omit anaphoric expressions referring to non-verbal parts of text ?
see an ex-ample from PDT, depicted in Figure 1:3 It is important to understand that coreference and all discourse relations, although technically annotated between two nodes, infact express a relation between the whole subtrees of the two nodes, as (on the tectogrammatical layer of PDT) a node representsthe whole subtree it governs.
(In case of discourse, more complex arguments can be specified in a dedicated attribute range.
)14(6) Ambrozek stated that the economic plan is an institution that proved itself already in the monarchy.Because of this plan, our forests remained preserved in a relatively good condition until the present days,he said.
(In original: Ambrozek uvedl, ?e hospod??sk?
pl?n je instituce, kter?
se osv?d?ila ji?
za mocn?
?stv?.D?ky tomuto pl?nu se na?e lesy zachovaly v pom?rn?
dobr?m stavu a?
do dne?n?ch dn?, ?ekl.
)In the example, there is the preposition because of (d?ky) that combines with the anaphoric expression thisplan (tento pl?n).
However, this plan (tento pl?n) does not refer to the whole previous argument (sen-tence) but only to its nominal part plan (pl?n) ?
it means that there is annotated a coreference relation be-tween these two nouns (see Figure 1 and the dark curved arrow between the two nodes plan in the twotrees).
Therefore, the expression because of this plan (d?ky tomuto pl?nu) is not an AltLex here.Figure 2.
An example of a coreference to a verbal node.
The trees have been cropped to fit the page.On the other hand, there is another example, depicted in Figure 2:(7) We have some contact options in all countries that foreign students in the former Czechoslovakia camefrom.Because of this, we might be able to look there for opportunities for our people, and our license is there-fore designed quite broadly.
(In original: M?me ur?it?
kontaktn?
mo?nosti ve v?ech st?tech, odkud poch?zeli zahrani?n?
studenti v b?va-l?m ?eskoslovensku.D?ky tomu bychom tam mohli hledat uplatn?n?
pro na?e lidi, a na?e licence je proto pojata dosti ?iroce.
)Again, there is the preposition because of (d?ky) with an anaphoric expression this (tomu) that, in this case,fulfils also the second condition, as it refers to the whole previous argument (sentence) represented by thefinite verb in the main clause to have (m?t) ?
see Figure 2 with the annotated coreference relation goingfrom this (ten) to a verb to have (m?t).
The discourse relation is represented by a thick orange arrow goingfrom the verb to have (m?t) to a verb to look for (hledat).These examples demonstrate that tokens of this type of AltLexes in PDT may be automatically lookedup on the basis of the two conditions: a) the preposition must combine with an anaphoric expression; b)this expression must be in a coreference or bridging relation (according to the finished annotation of co-reference ?
see Nedoluzhko et al., 2011) with some verbal node (representing the whole argument).4.3 Searching in the DataThe primary format of PDT is called Prague Markup Language (PML).
It is an abstract XML-based for-mat designed for annotation of treebanks.
For editing and processing data in the PML format, a highly15customizable tree editor TrEd4 was developed (Pajas and ?t?p?nek, 2008).
The search was performed inPML Tree Query (PML-TQ)5, a powerful client-server based query engine for treebanks (Pajas and?t?p?nek, 2010), with the client part implemented as an extension to the tree editor TrEd.Using the query engine, we searched for places in the data with a given preposition and an anaphoricexpression relating to a verbal node either as grammatical coreference, textual coreference, bridginganaphora, or coreference to segment.
The antecedent of the relation could either be directly the verbalnode or a coordination or apposition of verbal nodes, or it could be unspecified in case of coreference tosegment.Let us present a simplified example of such a query; this particular query searches for relevant places inthe PDT data with a preposition due to (vinou) plus an anaphoric expression:1 t-node $t :=2 [ (1+x coref_gram.rf t-node3       [ gram/sempos = "v" ] or4    1+x coref_text/target-node.rf t-node5       [ gram/sempos = "v" ] or6    1+x bridging/target-node.rf t-node7       [ gram/sempos = "v" ] or8    1+x coref_gram.rf t-node9       [ nodetype = "coap", t-node10           [ gram/sempos = "v" ] ] or11    1+x coref_text/target-node.rf t-node12       [ nodetype = "coap", t-node13           [ gram/sempos = "v" ] ] or14    1+x bridging/target-node.rf t-node15       [ nodetype = "coap", t-node16           [ gram/sempos = "v" ] ] or17    coref_special = "segm"),18   a/lex.rf|a/aux.rf a-node19      [ m/form ~ "^[Vv]inou$" ] ];2021 >> give $t.idLine 1 declares a tectogrammatical node (and names it $t for later reference), lines 2?17 specify a disjunc-tion of seven possible ways of an anaphoric reference (lines 2 and 3 define a grammatical coreferencefrom the given node to a verbal node (semantic part-of-speech equals "v"), lines 4 and 5 define the samecondition for textual coreference, lines 6 and 7 for bridging anaphora.
Lines 8?16 express the same threerelations, this time with an anaphoric verbal node being a part of a coordination or apposition (the relationis between the given node $t and the node representing the coordination or apposition (nodetype="coap")),and line 17 searches for a coreference to a not further specified segment).
Lines 18 and 19 express that onthe surface, the given node $t represents the preposition due to (vinou).
Finally, an output filter on line 21gives identifiers of positions in the data found by the query.For each preposition from a given list (see Table 1 below), the query produced a list of positions in thedata.
These positions were gone through by human annotators and discourse relations with all requiredadditional information were marked there.4.4 Results, Evaluation and DiscussionAltogether, PDT contains 1,482 tokens of selected prepositions (we worked with the types of prepositionsthat were, in some instances, marked as AltLexes in the preliminary phase of annotation).
Within them,we have automatically looked up 89 instances functioning as AltLexes.The results demonstrate that using coreference annotation significantly helped reduce the final numberof relevant instances (i.e.
those being AltLexes) and that it substantially facilitated the annotation of dis-course (instead of 1,482 instances, the human annotators had to go only through 89 of them, i.e.
onlythrough 6 % out of the total number in the whole PDT) ?
see Table 1 that introduces the total number ofall instances of given prepositions (in any role) in PDT and their final reduced numbers in the role of Alt-4 http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tred/5 http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pmltq/16Lexes.
So, for example, the preposition in addition to (krom?)
appears altogether in 309 instances in PDT,within which there are 44 instances in the function of AltLex (automatically looked up).
Allautomatically retrieved instances have then been manually checked and validated.PrepositionInstances asAltLexes TotalBecause of (d?ky) 14 191In addition to (krom?)

Occurrences of AltLexes in the data of PDT4.4.1 Reliability of Coreference in the AnnotationWe are aware of the fact that our method is dependent on the good annotation of coreference and that ifthere are some mistakes on the level of coreference, they will mirror also in discourse, logically.
Therefore,we have chosen one preposition (because of /d?ky) and manually checked all its tokens in PDT to examinethe validity of searching for AltLexes on the basis of coreference.We found out that coreference in PDT is annotated reliably.
Within 191 of all instances, there were 35with annotated coreference relations (14 leading to a verbal node, 21 to a non-verbal node) and 156 with-out any annotated relation.
Within these 156 instances6, we found only 3 disputable cases where the coref-erence could be annotated.
However, these examples are definitely not clear cases of coreference, but theyare rather questionable ?
see one of the examples from PDT:(8) Their immortality is born from the blood until John begins to age incredibly fast.Because of his disease, also a young doctor Sarah is pulled inevitably to a fatal whirl of bloody passionsand mystery of life and death...(In original: Z krve se rod?
jejich nesmrtelnost a?
do doby, ne?
John za?ne neuv??iteln?
rychle st?rnout.D?ky jeho chorob?
je do osudov?ho v?ru krvav?ch v??n?
a tajemstv?
?ivota i smrti neodvratn?
vta?ena tak?mlad?
l?ka?ka Sarah...)It is disputable whether the expression his disease (jeho chorob?)
is interpretable as coreferential to Johnbegins to age incredibly fast (John za?ne neuv??iteln?
rychle st?rnout).
We consider this example ambig-uous and therefore the annotation of similar examples is dependent on the decision of the individual anno-tator.
Moreover, it is disputable whether we can consider expressions like because of his disease (d?ky je-ho chorob?)
to be discourse markers.
Also other data from PDT demonstrated that AltLexes of this typemostly contain rather general and abstract words like these facts / this situation / this problem (tytoskute?nosti / tato situace / tento probl?m).4.4.2 Difference between the Preliminary and Final AnnotationThe final number of AltLexes like due to this (vinou toho), despite this (navzdory tomu) found in PDTusing the queries is 89.
Some of them have been captured already in the preliminary annotation ?
it means6 The instances have been discussed by two trained linguists.17they were provided with the annotators' comment AltLex.
There were altogether 306 of such comments inPDT, i.e.
expressions that were interpreted as AltLexes (of all types, not only the prepositions) by firstannotators.
In the section 2, we demonstrated that this number is rather approximate, as not all instances ofAltLexes have been captured.
For illustration, see Table 2 for prepositions with preliminary numbers oftokens that had the comment AltLex after the first phase of annotation.
The table shows that the prelimi-nary annotation captured only 9 out of 89 final AltLex instances of prepositions.
It means that the realnumber of this AltLex type grew almost ten times.PrepositionAnnotated as AltLex in thepreliminary annotationFinal number of AltLexinstancesBecause of (d?ky) 1 14In addition to (krom?)

Difference between the preliminary and final annotation in numbers5 ConclusionThe paper demonstrates the possibilities of using the present annotation of the Prague Dependency Tree-bank for practical annotations of discourse relations.
The aim of the paper was to introduce how we canuse the annotation of coreference for searching for the so called alternative lexicalizations of discourseconnectives like considering this situation (vzhledem k t?to situaci), on the basis of this (na z?klad?
toho).In this way, we significantly reduced the amount of manual annotation work, as we demonstrated in theevaluation part.This method may be used not only for prepositions like due to (d?ky), but also for all other multiworddiscourse markers containing an anaphoric expression, for example verbs like this means (to znamen?
),this leads to (to vede k), this is related to (s t?m souvis?)
etc.
for which the presence of an anaphoric ex-pression leading to the previous verbal argument is also compulsory.AcknowledgmentThe authors gratefully acknowledge support from the Czech Science Foundation (project n.P406/12/0658), from the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (project LH14011) and support fromthe project ?Discourse Connectives in Czech?

This work hasbeen using language resources developed, stored and distributed by the LINDAT/CLARIN project of theMinistry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (project LM2010013).7 The note 0 (1) means that this token was finally interpreted as not relevant, i.e.
not as AltLex because the anaphoric expressiondid not refer to the verbal but nominal node in this case.
Therefore, this token (although provided with the comment AltLex) wasexcluded from the final number.18ReferencesNicholas Asher.
