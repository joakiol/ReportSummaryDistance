ANDI~E TRETIAKOFFRESULTS OBTAINED WITH A NEW METHODFOR.
THE AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS OFSENTENCE STR.UCTUR.ESWe present in this paper a method for the automatic analysis ofsentence structures.Our purpose is to constitute a frequency dictionary of the differentstructures used in the language.
This dictionary will enable us to se-lect the most useful sentence structures in order to recommend theirexclusive use for the writing of texts intended for automatic translation.We think that the automatic translation will be possible only ifthe texts are submitted to rules which limit the complexity of theirsyntax.
These limitations will be the less noticed by an author as onlythe most unusual structures would have been left out.
Of course thenumber of permitted structures will increase as the automatic transla-tion codes are improved.The sentence structures are obtained by a statistical analysis of theword strings according to procedures developed in the informationtheory.In the present paper we have analysed only groups of two con-secutive words as an example of our method.The same type of analysis can be generalized by considering non-consecutive words and groups of more than two words.1.
GROUPSThe first step of the analysis is to put the words into groups accord-ing to their grammatical properties, for example: noun, adjective,article and so on.
The number of groups has been limited to keep sig-nificative frequencies with respect o the length of the corpus (3500words).
Inthe text under study, we have used 67 groups.
A list of thesegroups is given in Table 3.216 ANDP,~E TRBTIAKOFFOf course, our classification is somewhat arbitrary as it is basedon a preliminary knowledge of the language.
We will show later howthe results of the analysis can help us to detect inadequate classifications.Each word of the corpus has been replaced by a symbol (two fig-ures integer) representing its grammatical group.
We consider thewords inside the sentence, that is to say between two strong punctuationsigns (.
; !
?).
Inside the sentence all punctuation signs are suppressed.We will call now "words" these symbols.2.
DICTIONARY OF STRINGSThe second step is the constitution of a string dictionary.A sentence containing N words produces (N- -1 )  strings.
For in-stance, the sentence Her daughter gave me an Italian lesson every day repre-sented by the string " 55 04 01 44 45 05 04 85 04 ", produces the fol-lowing strings:156 55 HER ~2.173 1 ~157 4 DAUGHTEI~ ~0.024 2 ~o+~,158 1 GAVE.

ing string.of the preced-AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS OF SENTENCE STRUCTURES 217The dictionary emphasizes the identical strings whatever their posi-tion in the sentence might be.
A sample of the dictionary is givenin Table 1.For example, the string 05 04 which means an adjective followedby a common oun at the end of a sentence has the rank number 244,occurs 9 times in the sentences number 9, 10, 35 and so on.All the strings beginning by the groups 05, 04 are also listed.3.
SENTENCE STRUCTUREThe last step of the analysis is the production of sentence structures,using the correlations between two consecutive words.We can compare the probability Pj of a word j in the corpus andthe conditional probability Pj (if i) of the same word when the preced-ing word is given equal to i.
We shall call in this paper "degree ofcorrelation " the logarithm of the ratio of the conditional probabilityand the probability:C, s = Logs P~ (if i)/P~The degree of correlation will be positive when the probability toget a word is increased by the knowledge of the preceding word, andnegative when this probability is decreased.
It is a measure of the "af-finity" of two consecutive words.This procedure can be generalized by considering roups of morethan two words, not necessarily consecutive.For each sentence of the corpus we can build a structure basedon the correlation between two consecutive words in the followingway.
Inside the sentence, consecutive words are connected two by twoin order of decreasing degree of correlation.
For instance in the sen-tence:She loved a good laughwe have the following degrees of correlation:She loved = 2.56loved a = 1.23a good ~ 2.38good laugh = 1.86218 ANDI~E TRETIAKOFFTherefore the first words to be connected are She and loved thena and good.
We will consider that their union is the first level.
Thenthe word laugh will be connected to the group a good.
This union willbe a second level and finally the two halves of the sentence are con-nected and this union will be the third level.This structure can be represented by the following graph, automat-ically produced by the computer, and by the string 1 3 1 2 obtained bywriting the sequence of the successive l vels.SENTENCE NO 9231 44 SHE ~2.564 1 ~232 1 LOVED ~1.232 3 ~233 45 A ~ o2.379 1 ~ ?234 , 5 GOOD ~ ~ o1.860 2 ~235 4 LAUGH ~Degrees of correlation:She loved .

DICTIONARY OF STRUCTURESThis procedure has been applied for all the sentences of the text,producing strings of numbers which represent the structure of thesesentences.For each string of numbers, by suppressing the highest num-ber we obtain 2 strings representing 2 substructures of this sentence.We carry on this procedure till the string has only 1 number, that isto say represents he structure of a group of 2 words.For instance the structure of the sentence Her daughter gave me anItalian lesson every day is represented by the following string ofnumbers:AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS OF SENTENCE STRUCTURES 219SENTENCE NO 5156 55 HER **2.173 1 *~*157 4 DAUGHTER **0.024 2 *****158 1 GAVE *~ *1.267 1 ~159 44 ME ~--0.702 4 ~160 45 AN ~2.379 1 ~*  o161 5 ITAL IAN *~ *1.860 2 *** *162 4 LESSON ~*** *--0.421 3 ~*163 85 EVERY **2.194 1 ~164 4 DAY ~*Complete string: 1 2 1 4 1 2 3 1 (level 4)1 substring : 1 2 3 1 (level 3)2 substrings: 1 2 1 1 2 (level 2)3 substrings: 1 1 1 1 (level 1)All the structures and substructures are classified in a dictionary,giving their frequencies and the positions of the sentences containingthe corresponding word strings (Table 2).For example, the structure 1 4 2 1 3 has the rank number65 and is found 5 times in the sentences number 12 16 21 24 41.5.
CLASSIFICATION ERRORSIf the structure of a sentence is unsatisfactory, this can be due toan error in the classification of a word of this sentence.
This observa-tion is used to detect and correct classification errors.
For examplein the sentence:But come mother8t 02 24I like to44 01 17fJII220 ANDP.EE TRETIAKOFPthe word come had been classified in a wrong group 02 (indicative ofintransitive verbs).
When corrected (22 = infinitive of intr.
verbs)we obtain the following structure:But I like to come mother81 44 01 17 22 24t 1 t II - -  IIIAnother way to check the classification of words into groups isto use the quantity of information associated to the law of succession oftwo consecutive words.
It is known from communication theory thatthe average amount of information by word is reduced when we knowthe law of succession of two consecutive words.
This reduction isprecisely equal to the average degree of correlation of all the groups:~jWe shall call it quantity of information associated to the law ofsuccession of two consecutive words.In order to check the validity of the choice of the grammaticalgroup for a word, the quantity of information associated to the lawof succession of the groups is measured.
Then, changing the choice ofthe group, the quantity of information is measured again for this newclassification.
The greater the quantity of information associated to alaw of succession of the groups, the better the distribution of thesewords into these groups.6.
CONCLUSIONThe sample chosen here (a novel by S. Maugham of 3500 words)is too short to obtain significant frequencies for the different structures.This sample contains 200 sentences of an average length of 17 words.In spite of the simplicity of the method Of analysis employed, 72sentences of an average length of 10 words have been correctly ana-lysed.This shows that the correlation of 2 consecutive words, althoughinsufficient, will play an important part in the more elaborated methodsof analysis that we are now developing.AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS OF SENTENCE STRUCTURES244 9245 1246 1247 1248 1249 1250 1251 1252 1253 1254 2255 1256 1257 1258 -1259 1260 1261 1262 1263 1264 1TABL~ 1.5 49 10 35 37 41 49 54 66 725411722975435541354305 4 1 35 4 7 55 4 85 4405414495477415 4 3 17 23 35 4 97 45 5 4 97 35 41654944341685 4 16 24 9 44 1 54145 4 80 95 4 16 55 4 44 2 26254854554972413 425497354165 4 97 65 5 4 1 35 4 7 55 4 85 440554415 5~4 1 35 4305 17 21 45 4175 17 21 66 85 4505 17 22 16 35 4 7 45 5 4725 17 22 264452744635 27 55 4221222 ANDR~E TRETIAKOFFTABL~ 2.Rank Frequen~56 1 0 13  2 1 4 5 1 2 1 6 1 2 3 12257 1 0 1 3 2 1 6 4 3 1 2 5 1 3 2 16158 1 0 1 4 1 2 1 333 .
