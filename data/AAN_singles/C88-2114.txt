FRAMEWORK FOR A MODEL OF DIALOGUERonan REILLYEducational Research CentreSt Patrick's College, DublinGiacomo FERRARIDepartment of LinguisticsUniversity of PisaIrina PRODANOFInstitute for Computational Linguistics - CNRPisaI INTRODUCTIONIn this paper we present a general model ofcmmnunication applied to the special case ofdialogue.
Our broad perspective aims to account forthe many facets of human dialogue within a singl~theoretical framework.
In particular, our project'saim of incorporating relevant non-verbalcommunicative acts from the person-machine interfacemake it essential that the description ofcommunication be sufficiently broad.The model described here takes as its starting pointthe communicative utterance or act.
It considers thehigher-order structures into which communicative actsmay be incorporated, but does not detail theirinternal composition.
It is in this sense that themodel provides a framewerk for the formal treatmentof dialogue.2 COMPONENTS OF THE MODELA full description of the adopted dialogue model hasbeen given in Egan, Ferrari, Harper, et al (1987).It relies on a double deserlption of dialogue: asyntactic analysis of dialogue structure and asemantic-pragmatic description of the communicationcontext.
The basic units are:- meaningful expression (ME): Any physical actcarrying a non-contextual meaning;- communicative act (CAct): An instance of MEissued by a specific "issuer" and received by aspecific "receiver";- communicative situation (CS): The CAct togetherwith all the relevant facets.- communicative situation structure (CSS): A largeraggregation of "CSs that provide a bridge into theintentional component of the dialogue model.Each of these components is discussed in more detailbelow.2.1 Communicative Acts and Dialogue StructureThe syntactic component of the dialogue model relieson the fact that, if we examine a dialogue or anyother communicative exchange, it is possible toobserve in the sequence of communicative acts, sub-sequences which follow regular patterns.
Thesepatterns can be catalogued in a form which expressestheir significant regularities.
This approach leadsto a descriptive method very similar to the formaldescription of language in terms of a vocabulary ofterminal symbols (the communicative acts), avocabulary of auxiliary symbols (a collection oflabels), and a set of productions (discoursepatterns).
Within the definition of a communicativeact, provision is made for gestural informationaccompanying an utterance, such as a deictic gestureinvolving a mouse or some other pointing device (inthe context of person-machine interaction).The idea of treating discourse segments likephrases in a sentence is not new (cf.
Burton, 1981).However, the nature of the entities involved israrely fully clarified.
In Christie, Egan, Ferrari,et al (1985), a dialogue classification system waspresented, based on the system of classification ofBurton (1981), It consisted of a set of functionallabels divided into the following five hierarchicallevels, from lower to higher,acts: {marker, summons, elicitation,reply .... },moves: (delineating, sketching .... },exchanges: (explicit, boundary,conversational,....},transactions: (exchange,...}interactions: (transaction .... }The labels at the act level are defined in terms offunctional labels assigned to expressions, such as"starter", structurally realized by a statement, aquestion, or a command; "informative" structurallyrealized by a statement; "elicltation", structurallyrealized by a question.
These, together with theirfunctional definitions, represent a closed set ofelements.
The labels at a higher level are alldefined in terms of patterns of labels of theimmediately lower level.
This set of rules may beregarded as the set of productions, which generatescommunications.
In this way, a dialogue/communication is adequately described in terms of aformal generative grammar.
An ATN-like grammar ofdialogue in these terms has been described in Egan,Forrest, Gardiner et al (1986) and Reilly (inpress).2.2 ~ommunicative SituationsThe semantic-pragmatlc description relies on thenotion of "communicative situation" (CS).
A CS is away of representing the communicative exchangetogether with its context.
It consists of facets,which are aspects of the CS that occur with a certainregularlty in all CSs of a given sort.
Facets may beformally conceived of as "sorted regularities" in thescene where communication takes place, therefore a CSmay be described asCS w {fs' ft .... }where the subscripts identify the sort of the facet.It is relatively easy to identify the sort of themore frequent regularities, such as who the issuer is(fi) , who the receiver is ( f ) ,  etc., and to considerthese as constituent elements of a CS, around whichother facets become, from time to time, relevant.540Situation Semantics has been shown (ef.
Egan,Ferrari, Harper, et al 1987) to have some advantagesfor the representation and the treatment of a CS,provided that certain modifications and extensions tothe original description of a discourse situation arecarried out.
In communication, since more than one,and often more than two, participants are involved,each with different attunements to the CS anddifferent perceptions of what in Situation Semanticsis called the speaker's connections, more than oneclassification of the same CS is possible.
In thebest case, where participants understand a CS in thesame way, communication is successful, otherwise somefailure occurs.
In general we can assume, thatparticipants in a communicative event are able firstto classify, and then understand situations on thebasis of the situation types they share.
In thespirit of SS, we assume ~lat these CS-types are thedescription of regularities observed in actualeo~tunicatiens.
An important consequence is that anew notion, relevance or relevant ~-~M,  isestablished in terms of the more frequently observedregularities.We can, then, describe the facets of theconununicative situation in terms of properties ofthat situation, where the notion of relevanceintervenes at two levels.
At the first level, theset of properties is not defined a priori.
Differentproperties are relevant to the interpretation ofdifferent utterances in different situations.
Someof these arc involved more frequently than others inthe process of understanding, and may be considered,tore fundamental than others to a CS.
These seem tobe the  roles of issuer, receiver, location,colm~unication mode, illocution.
The communicationmode, i.e.
, whether co~mtnication happens face-to-face, by telephone, or in any other way, may affectboth the form of the message and the referringexpressions.
By illoeution, the traditionalillocutioeary force is meant, although a more fine~grained classification of speech acts is intended(cf.
Christie, Egan, Ferrari, et el, 1985).
Also,other facets of a CS may occasionally become relevantto the understanding of an utterance.At the second level, each property of a CS is takento be a role participating in an intersecting set ofregularities which qualify its sort.
Thus, theproperty:\[xl<<l , saying, x, ~>,l>\]describes some indeterminate x saying ~, andparticipating in those situations where it is"regular" (nomie) that some x says ~.By further specification we can assume that\[a-touristl<<l , saying, a-tourist, e>,l>\]participates in those situations in which x is oftype a-tourlst.
In Barwise and Perry's (\].985)notation this would be given as:\[x I In S: a-tourist, x, yes\]where S is the set of situation-types in which atourist is involved.Both properties and types classify real objects thatbecome lelevant to a discourse situation inaccordance with the relations participants areattuned to.
On the basis of this notion ofrelevance, it is possible to define a large set oftypes of properties wh ich  may or may not appear inone or the other CS.
A receiver makes use of theseclassificatory devices to classify and understand anyspeeifle CS with which he or she is presented.Focus space k.~ SpeakerDisplayOActAct typeAct structure\Figure 1" Structural components of the model2.3 Cotmmunicative Situation StructuresThe Conmtunicative Situation Structure (CSS) isequivalent in level of analysis to the discoursesegment of the Grosz and Sidner (1986) model.
Thethree components of the CSS (see Figure I) are theconm~nicative act component (CAct), the communicativesituation component (CS), and certain propertiesspecific to the CSS itself.
A CSS can consist of anumber of CSs, and these in turn can consist of anumber of CAets.
The nature of CActs and CSs hasalready been discussed above.A number of factors serve to distinguish onecommunicative situation from another.
These caninvolve any change in the context of the dialogue;for example, a change in location or a change ofspeaker, in the ease of person-mach~le communicationit is most likely to involve a change in the speakeror a change in some aspect of the computer's visualdisplay.A number of eo~nunicative situations go to make up aCSS.
What distinguishes one CSS from another is achange in the purpose of the CSS.
The CSS is alsothe repository of information about what entities inthe dialogue arc currently in focus.
Thi.sinformation is used in the reso\].ution of anaphora.2.4 Structural Relationsh~p~,A CSS can be related to another CSS in a limited way.The  relationship can only be hierarchical, and itrepresents a route through which information relatingto the focus of attention can be transmitted.
If tilefocus of attention is on one CSS, definite nounphrases and anaphora in general can be resolvedeither from entities in focus within the current CSSor from the focus space of a CSS that is connected tothe current one.F igure 2 represents a structured collection of CSSs.As can be seen, they consist of a number of treefragments, rather than one large tree.
Such asituation can occur if the purpose of a dialogue isto achieve a number of distinct goals, which cannotbe integrated under a dominating CSS.3 PRAGMATIC DIMENSIONS3.1 Attentional StateThe disembodied arrow in Figure 2 represents thecurrent focus of attention.
The focus of attentionsets bounds on what are valid targets for anaphoriereference within a CSS.
This focus shiftsautomatically as a new CSS is created.
It can alsobe shifted by one or other of the dialogueparticipants explicitly requesting a shift of focusback to a previous topic in the dialogue.
However,there is a constraint put on this shift.
When movingfrom one tree fragment to another, the focus ofiattention can only shift to the top-most node of the541fFigure 2: A set of cornrnurficative situation structurestarget tree.
From there, it may traverse thesubordinate nodes of the tree to locate theapprdpriate CSS.
This restriction reflects the factthat when a dialogue participant returns to apreviously active topic in the dialogue, he or shetends to proceed from the general to the specificaspect of that topic.
Traversal of the CSS tree fromtop to bottom represents such a transition.The component of the model operated upon by theattentional mechanism is the focus space.
Thisconsists of a list of items that we call discourseobjects.
Tile entities on the list can either haveproperties in their own right, or can Inberit themf\]:'om higher up in a classification hierarchy.
Thereason for hav ing highly structured objects in thefoe~.~s space, is to allow for the resolution ofanaphoric rcferenee.~ of the following type (afterS~dner, 1.9/9):A: if: saw John's Irish Wolfhound yesterdayB: Yes.
They're really big dogs.
!i~ (J',) the phrase ljh_eJ_~ge does ;lot refer back to  any~pecifio entity mentioned in (A), but rather to t;hceJ::J.ss of dogs of whieh John's is a member.
In ordersL.toeessfu\].ly to resolve this reference, knowledge~<:eds to be available to  the resolution processconcerning the class of entities to which thespeeific irish Wolfhound mentioned belongs.
The waythis is achieved in tile model described here, is toa\].\[low the entities in the focus space to inheritproperties via a classification hierarchy.3.2 Intentional StructureAs has been pointed out in the description of thedialogue structures, the topmost element of thestructural hierarchy (the CSS) contains a pointerinto a structure representing the purpose of the CSS.Crosz and Sidner refer the set of such CSS purpose.
'.~as the intentional structure of the dialogue.
Inessence the CSS purposes arc elements in the planunderlying the dialogue.
In the case of a person-machine dialogue system, they are the actions thattile user wishes the system to perform.
There are t~;orelationships that can hold between elements of theintentional structure and these are dominance andsatisfaetion-@rpcedenee.
These represent goal/sub-goal and pre-eondltion relationships, respectively.The hierarchy of intentional elements is more or lessisomorphic to the dialogue structure, as can be seenin Figure 3.
Here, tlle dialogue st1:ucture i.?~:epz'esented by white boxes and the underlyingintentional structure by shaded boxes.
Also notethat the intentional structure may be expanded by aninferential process, without there being acol:responding node in the dialogue structure.The specif_ie details of the intentional structure isdependent on the dialogue domain, unlike tbe dialogue542structure.
In the following example of anapplication of the model, the domain is that ofdatabase interaction with the user performing thespecific task of tabulating data about students' a~esand courses.
Each intentional component representsan action of tabulation, and the place that theaction has in the intentional hierarchy is determinedby the complexity of the table requested (orinferred)./.

'~ ~Figure 3: The relationship between dialogueand intentional structure.4 A SAMPLE APPLICATIONThe following dialogue (except $8) was collected aspart of a corpus of simulated person~maehinedialogues collected for the studies described inEgan~ Harris, Harper, and Reilly (1986).
$8 isinserted to illustrate how an inferred intention canhe used by the system to direct the dialogue.I\]i: How marly students, both male and female,under 16 or younger in the year degreecourse'/$2: Tbere are no students of that age group inthe Cell.ego.U3: Again in the 3 year degree course, how manymale and female students in the followingage groups: 19 20 21 22 23 25 or older$4: Here is the table.US: Total\[ number of both male and femalestudents in this course of study$6: 153 males and 559 fema\].es.U7: Please supply a breakdown of both male andfemale students in the graduate course.$8: Do you wish to see a complete sex by age bycourse breakdown?Figure 4 illustrates the unfolding of both thedialogue and intentional structures (the numbers intile boxes correspond to utterances).
The intentionalstructure underlying $8 is inferred on the basis thatthe user has asked for the same breakdown for twocourses, therefore he or she may wish to have athree-way breakdown for all courses.
This inferencethen gives rise to utterance $8, which isincorporated into the dialogue structure.
The leftof Figure 4 represents the state of the dialogue andintentional structures up to and including utteranceFigure 4: A Structural analysis of the sample, DialogueU7.
The right: of the figure represents thestructure:; after $8.In U5, the reference to all unspecified course(underlined) requires that a referent be found.
Thebi-direetional links in the discourse structure allowinformation from the focus spaces of the connectednodes to be accessed in the resolution process.Thus, the  anaphoric reference in U5 can be reso\].vedby accessing the focus space of utterances 3 antl 4.Note  that: the small disembodied arrows in F igure  4indleate t:he current attentional state of thedialogue.5 CONCLUSIONThe d ia logue  taode\], out \ ] .

For  exmuple ,  140a lgor i thmic  descr ip t ion  has  been  prov ided  that  cang~uerate and utilise the data strttctures of themode 1.The resettrch programme, of which the work descrihedhere is a part, is sti\].l in the early stages ofimplementation.
However, a m~aber of implementationdecisions have already been made which give someIndieatJeu of what the final system will look like.Both the dialogue and intentional structures are tobe repre~;ented using a frame-based language.
Theframes will be connected in a network.
Theinstant\]at\]on and interconnect\]on of the frames willbe the job of a general control algorithm, while thefilling of many of the slots in the various framesw:i\]i be demo's driven, That is, associated with eachslot will be a function that is activated when datais required for the slot, such as when the framecontaining the slot is instant\]areal.
Limited usewill be made of the inheritance mechanism of thef~:ame system.
Inheritance will be main\].y used forthe inheritance of foeus- space information.
Thefeature of frames that will he most utilised is thatof demon-driven slot filling,REFERENCESBarwise, J., & Perry, d, (1983).
