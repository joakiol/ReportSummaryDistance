INTRODUCTIONThe purpose of this paper is to pro-pose a system of mapping classes of syn-tactic structures as instruments for auto-matic text understanding.
The system con-sists of a set of verb classes and Jnfor-matlon on mapping them together with nounphrases, tense and aspect, and \]s supposedto he ut i l ized for inference in automatictext understanding.The language used  fo r  i l l us t ra t ion  o fthe  sys tem i s  Japanese .There Is a tendency for non-syntact icanalysers and semant ic  grammars In auto-matic text understanding.
However.
thisproposal Is motivated by the fact thatsyntact ic  structures, once analyzed andclassi f ied in terms of semant ic  related-ness, provide much information for" under-standing.
This is supported by the factthat human beings use syntact ica l ly  re-lated sentences when they ask questionsabout texts.The system we are proposing has thefol lowing elements:1) Verb classes.2) Mapping of noun phrases betweenor among some verb  classes.3) Direct ion of possib le infel'encebetween the classes with information ontense and aspect.Our experiment, in which subjects areasked to make true-false quest ions aboutcertain texts, revealed that native speak-ers think that they understand texts bydeduct ing sentences lexical ly or semanti -cally related.
For instance, a human beingrelates quest ions such as 'Did Mary go toa theater?'
to a sentence in texts such as'John took Mary to a theater.'
Or, by thesame sentence, he understands that 'Marywas in the theater."II.
FEATURES OF THE JAPANESE SYNTAXFeatures of ,Japanese syntax relevantto the d iscuss ion in this paper are pre-sented below.The sentence usual ly ha:# case mark-ings as postposi t ions to noun phrases.
Fori ns tance .I.
John qa Mary D_J_ himitsu o hanashita'John told a secret to  Mary.
'In  sentence  1. postpos i t ions  ga .

'Ni in the sentences 2, 3.

This isdue to  the verb  ca |egory  (3  and  41 OF thec lass  of  noun phrases  (2 and 31 appear ingin  each  sentence .Certain mor'phemc classes hide thecasemark ing.
e.g.5.
John  ~Q i t ta .
"John a lso  went (y;omewhere).6.
Tokyo mo i t ta .
'Someone went to  Tokyo also.
'The mo in sentence 5 and 6 means 'a l so ' .Therefore these sentences are derived fromd i f fe rent  syntact i ca l  const ruct ions ,  thati s .
sentences 7 and 8. respect ive ly .7.
John ga i t ta .
"John went (somewhere).'8.
Tokyo  n__ki i t ta .?

"Furthermore.
as i l l us t ra ted  in sen-tences 5 through 6, noun phrases ,lay bedeleted f ree ly ,  provided the contextgives fu l l  information.

F ina l ly .
thereare  many pa i rs  o f  lex ica lLy  re la ted  verbs ,tz'ansi t i re  and inst\] a~it i re,  indicat ingthe :;ame phenomenon d i f fe rent ly9.
John ga t,4ary ni hon  o m_!seta .
",h)hn showed a hook to  Mary.10.
Mal'y ga hon o !~ i ta .
"Uary  saw a book .
'The two expressions, or viewpoints,  on thesame phenomenon, that is, 'John showed toMary a book which she saw.'
are relatedin Japanese by the verb root ~_l.The system under considerat ion uti-lizes some of the above features (casemarking and lexical ly related verbs) andin turn can be used to ease di f f icul t iesof automatic understanding,  caused by someother features (case hiding, ambiguiouscase marking and de let ion  of  nounphrases .
)I I I .
VERB CLASSThe system is i l l us t ra ted  below withverbs re la ted  to the notion of movement.The verb c lasses  in th i s  category are asfo l lows :(1 )  Verb class of causal i ty ofmovementtCM)Examples:tsureteiku ' to  take (aperson)'tsuretekuru 'to bring (aperson)"hakobu 'to carry"yaru 'to give"oshieru "to tell'Verbs of th i s  c lass  indicate that  someonecauses something or someone moves.
How tomove varies as seen later.
(2) Verb c lass  of movement(MV)Examples:iku " to  go'kuru  ' to  come"idousuru "to move"Verbs of  th i s  c lass  indicated that some-th ing or someone moves from one place toanother.
(3) Verb class of existence(EX)Examples:iru ' (animate) be"aru "(inanimate) be'Verbs of th i s  c lass  indicate the ex istenceof something or someone.410(4) Verb class o f  possess lon(PS)Examples:motsu ' to  possess'kau 'to keep'Verbs of this class indicate someone'spossession of something or someone.the case s lo t .
As seen below, the differ-ence between yaru, 'to give' and uru, 'tosell' is that the latter has 'money' asinstrument, whi le the former does not.
In-cidentally, J apanese  has  a verb  yuzuruwh ich  can  be  used  whether  the  ins t ruh~entIs money o r  not .Not i ce  that  the  fundamenta l  not ion  o fMOVE here  i s  much w ider  than  the  normalmean ing  o f  the  word 'move ' .

Furthermore.
th is  system canalso be u t i l i zed  in the automatic textunderstanding by locating missing nounphrases and determining ambiguous grammat-ical cases in the sentence, f inding seman-t i ca l l y  re lated sentences between thequestions and the text ,  and gathering ther ight semantic information.By the~ie condit ions, the mapping ofsyntact ic  s t ructures  presented in DiagramII is transformed to that in terms of in-dividual verbs.
Furthermore, rules of d i -rect ions fo r  reasoning presented in  D ia -gram IV connect  spec i f i c  sentences.Take the fo l low ing  sentence  fo r  example .Since th is  system uses information onsyntact ic  s t ruc tures ,  i t  is much simplerin terms of the semantic s t ructures  thanthe Conceptual Dependencey Model, for in-stance, and the mapping among the sentencepatterns semantical ly re lated much moreexp l i c i t .I I .
