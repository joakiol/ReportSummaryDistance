T he u nsu pervisedmorpheme analy sis is a particu larly attrac-tive approach for speech and lang u ag e tech-nolog y for the morpholog ically complex lan-g u ag es.
W hen the amou nt of distinct w ordforms b ecomes prohib itive for the constru c-tion of a su ffi cient lex icon, it is importantthat the w ords can b e seg mented into smallermeaning fu l lang u ag e modeling u nits.
In thispresentation w e w ill demonstrate the resu ltsof the evalu ations, the b aseline sy stems b u iltu sing the open sou rce tools, and invite re-search g rou ps to participate in the nex t eval-u ation w here the task is to enhance statisticalmachine translation b y morpheme analy sis.A proposal for a T y pe I I D emo1 Ex tended A b strac t1 .1 T he segmentation of w ords intomorphemesO ne of the fu ndamental task s in natu ral lang u ag eprocessing applications, su ch as larg e-vocab u laryspeech recog nition (L V CS R), statistical machinetranslation (S M T ) and information retrieval (IR),is the morpholog ical analy sis of w ords.
It is par-ticu larly important for the morpholog ically com-plex lang u ag es, w here the amou nt of differentw ord forms is su b stantially increased b y infl ection,derivation and composition.
T he decomposition ofw ords is req u ired not only for u nderstanding the sen-tence, b u t in many lang u ag es also for ju st represent-ing the lang u ag e b y any tractab le and trainab le sta-tistical model and lex icon.
T he manu ally composedru le-b ased morpholog ical analy z ers can solve theseprob lems to some ex tent, b u t only a fraction of theex isting lang u ag es have b een covered so far, and formany the coverag e of the relevant content is insu ffi -cient.T he ob jective of the M orpho Challeng e1 is to de-sig n and evalu ate new u nsu pervised statistical ma-chine learning alg orithms that discover w hich mor-phemes (smallest individu ally meaning fu l u nits oflang u ag e) w ords consist of.
T he g oal is to discoverb asic vocab u lary u nits su itab le for different task s,su ch as L V CS R, S M T and IR.
In u nsu pervised learn-ing the list of morphemes is not pre-specifi ed foreach lang u ag e, b u t the optimal morpheme lex iconand morpheme analy sis of all different w ord formsis statistically optimiz ed from a larg e tex t corpu s ina completely data-driven manner.T he evalu ation of the morpheme analy sis alg o-rithms is performed b oth b y a ling u istic and an ap-plication oriented task .
T he analy sis ob tained fora long list of w ords is fi rst compared to the lin-g u istic g old standard representing a g rammaticallycorrect analy sis b y verify ing that the morpheme-sharing w ord pairs are the correct ones (K u rimo etal., 2 0 0 7 ) .
T his is repeated in different lang u ag esand then the ob tained decomposition of w ords isapplied in state-of-the-art sy stems ru nning variou s1S ee http://w w w .cis.hu t.fi /morphochalleng e2 0 0 9 /13NLP applications.
The suitability of the morphemesis v erifi ed by comparing the performance of the sys-tems to each other and to systems using unprocessedw ord s or conv entional w ord processing alg orithmslik e stemming or rule-based d ecompositions.A s a baseline method in all application, w e hav ebuilt systems by applying the M orfessor alg orithm,w hich is an unsuperv ised w ord d ecomposition alg o-rithm d ev eloped at our research g roup (C reutz andLag us, 20 0 2) and released as open source softw areimplementation2.1.2 Morphemes in Information RetrievalIn information retriev al ( I R ) from tex t d ocuments atypical task is to look for the most relev ant d ocu-ments for a g iv en q uery.
O ne of the k ey challeng esis to red uce all the infl ected w ord forms to a commonroot or stem for effectiv e ind ex ing .
F rom the mor-pheme analysis point of v iew this task is to d ecom-pose all the w ord s in the q uery and tex t d ocumentsand fi nd out those common morphemes w hich formthe most relev ant link s.In M orpho C halleng e the IR systems built usingthe unsuperv ised morpheme analysis alg orithms arecompared in state-of-the-art C LE F task s in F innish,G erman and E ng lish (K urimo and Turunen, 20 0 8 )using the mean av erag e precision metric.
The resultsare also compared to those obtained by the g rammat-ical morphemes as w ell as the stemming and w ordnormaliz ation method s conv entionally used in IR .1.3 Morphemes in S peec h Rec og nitionIn larg e-v ocabulary continuous speech recog nition(LV C S R ) one k ey part of the process is the statis-tical lang uag e mod eling w hich d etermines the priorprobabilities of all the possible w ord seq uences.
A nespecially challeng ing task is to cov er all the pos-sible w ord forms w ith suffi cient accuracy, becauseany out-of-v ocabulary w ord s w ill not only be nev ercorrectly recog niz ed , but also sev erely d eg rad e themod eling of the other nearby w ord s. B y d ecompos-ing the w ord s into meaning ful sub-w ord units, suchas morphemes, larg e-v ocabulary lang uag e mod elscan be successfully built ev en for the most d iffi cultag g lutinativ e lang uag es, lik e F innish, E stonian andTurk ish (K urimo et al, 20 0 6 b).2S ee http://w w w .cis.hut.fi /projects/morpho/In M orpho C halleng e the unsuperv ised mor-pheme alg orithms hav e been compared by usingthe morphemes to train statistical lang uag e mod elsand applying the mod els in state-of-the-art LV C S Rtask s in F innish and Turk ish (K urimo et al, 20 0 6 a) .B enchmark s for the same task s w ere obtained bymod els that utiliz e the g rammatical morphemes asw ell as trad itional w ord -based lang uag e mod els.1.4 Morphemes in Mac hine T ranslationThe state-of-the-art statistical machine translation(S M T) systems are affected by the morpholog icalv ariation of w ord s at tw o d ifferent stag es (V irpi-oja et al, 20 0 7 ) .
In the fi rst stag e, the alig nmentof the source and targ et lang uag e w ord s in a par-allel training corpus and the training of the transla-tion mod el can benefi t from the d ecomposition ofcomplex w ord s into morphemes.
This is particularlyimportant w hen either the targ et or the source lan-g uag e, or both, are morpholog ically complex .
Thefi nal stag e w here the targ et lang uag e tex t is g ener-ated , may also req uire morpheme-based mod els, be-cause the larg e-v ocabulary statistical lang uag e mod -els are applied in the same w ay as in LV C S R .In the on-g oing M orpho C halleng e 20 0 9 compe-tition, the morpheme analysis alg orithms are com-pared in S M T task s, w here the analysis is need edfor the source lang uag e tex ts.
The E uropean Par-liament parallel corpus (K oehn, 20 0 5 ) is used inthe ev aluation.
The source lang uag es are F innishand G erman and the targ et in both task s is E ng lish.To obtain a state-of-the-art performance in the task sthe morpheme-based S M T w ill be combined w ith aw ord -based S M T using the M inimum B ayes R isk( M B R ) interpolation of the N-best translation hy-pothesis of both systems (d e G ispert et al, 20 0 9 ) .1.5 Morpho C halleng e 20 0 9A s its pred ecessors, the M orpho C halleng e 20 0 9competition is open to all and free of charg e. Theparticipants?
are ex pected to use their unsuperv isedmachine learning alg orithms to analyz e the w ordlists of d ifferent lang uag es prov id ed by the org aniz -ers and submit the results of their morpheme analy-sis.
The org aniz ers w ill then run the ling uistic ev al-uations and build the IR and S M T systems and pro-v id e all the results and comparisons of the d ifferentsystems.
The participated alg orithms and ev aluation14results will be presented at the Morpho Challengework shop that is c urrently planned to tak e plac ewithin the H L T - N A A CL 2 0 1 0 c onferenc e.AcknowledgmentsT he Morpho Challenge c om petitions and work shopsare part of the E U N etwork of E x c ellenc e P A S CA LChallenge program and organiz ed in c ollaborationwith CL E F .
