STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF JAPANESE CHARACTERSbyTakushi TanakaThe National Language Research Institute3-9-14 Nishigaoka Kita-ku, TokyoSummaryThe purpose of this study is toanalyze the statistical property ofJapanese characters for computer pro-cessing.
Sentences in high school text-books and newspapers have been investi-gated in this study.
This paper con-tains the following points : the numberof different words written in each char-acter, position of characters in a word,relation between word boundaries andcharacter strings, relation betweenparts of speech and patterns of charac-ter strings, relation between parts ofspeech and each character.The results of these investigationscan be applied to the processing ofwritten Japanese for practical purpose.i.
IntroductionThere are several different aspectsbetween Eng l i sh  and Japanese in theinformation processing of natural lan-guage.
The first concerns the number ofcharacters.
In order to write Japanesemore than 2,000 characters are used.The second concerns the way of writing.A Japanese sentence consists of a con-tinuous character string without anyspace between words.
The third concernsword order and other syntactic features.Among these aspects, the second andthird features are closely related tothe characters.Japanese characters consist ofthree kinds.
A KANJI(Chinese character)is used to write nouns and the principalpart of a predicate, and expresses theconcepts contained in the sentence.A HIRAGANA (traditional Japanese char-acter) is used to write conjunctions,adverbs, JODOSHI (mainly expresses manymodalit ies of a predicate) and JOSHI(post-position, mainly expresses caserelations).
A KATAKANA (traditionalJapanese character) is used mainly asphonetic signs to write foreign words.Accordingly, Japanese charactersare regarded as elements of words, atthe same time, they function to charac-terize the syntactic or semantic classesof words and express word boundaries ina character string.The following Japanese characterstrings, (A) to (D), are the same sen-tenCes written by using KANJI to dif-ferent degrees.
(D) is quoted from a high school text-book (world history).While (A), (B) and (C) are transliteratedfrom (D) by computer.

(B) is wr i t ten in HIRAGANA, KATAKANAand 200 KANJI of high f requency inJapanese writ ing.
(C) is wr i t ten in HIRAGANA, KATAKANAand the so-cal led educat ional  KANJI(996 characters) .Low graders in e lementary schooltend to write sentences like (A).
Theolder they get the more KANJI  they learnand they begin to write sentences like(D) in high school.
When we read sen-tences like (A), we real ize it is veryd i f f icu l t  to read them, because we can-not find word boundar ies  easi ly.
On theother hand, in (B), (C) and (D) we findless d i f f i cu l ty  in this order.
Becausewe can easi ly  find out word boundar iesby means of KANJI in a character  string.Boundar ies  between a HIRAGANA part and aKANJI part play a role to indicate wordboundar ies  in many cases.
We can alsograsp main concepts  in a sentence byfocusing our attent ion to the KANJIparts of the sentence.Therefore,  it is very important touse HIRAGANA and KANJI appropr ia te ly  ina character  string.
It is, however, hardto say the rules for the appropr iate  useof H IRAGANA and KANJI have been estab-l ished.
Due to the fact, it is necessaryfor us to study more about the actualuse of Japanese characters.
Because,expl icat ion of rules for the appropr iateuse of the characters  is a prerequis i tefor informat ion process ing in commonlywr i t ten Japanese.2.

3 HIRAGANA occupies the firstplace account ing for 47.1%.
Accord ing tothe result of Nakano's  study which wi l lbe presented here, KANJI  takes the f irstplace in the newspaper,  because theyhave TV-programs and mini  adver t i sementwhich are both wr i t ten main ly  in KANJI.
4Fig.2 i l lustrates the rate of dif-ferent characters  in the data of text-books.
The data conta ins  1,525 d i f ferentcharacters.
KATAKANA and HIRAGANA arecomposed of basic 47 characters  respec-t ively, however the data also containsvar iat ions  like small letters and let-ters with special  symbols, and both kindof KANA exceed 70.
Most of H IRAGANA andKATAKANA were appeared in the data oftextbooks.
The data contains 1,312 dif-ferent KANJI.
The more data is invest i -gated the more KANJI appear, and therate of KANJI increases in the graph.'

Number of d i f ferent  wordswr i t ten in each characterAs we have more than 50,000 charac-ters, it is necessary  to dec ide thedegree  of importace of them.
In orderto decide the degrees two cr i ter ia  areassumed here.
One is the f requency ofthe characters .
The other one i s thenumber of d i f ferent  words in which thesame character  is used.
The similarconcept  has been proposed by A. Tanaka.
7In Fig.5, axis X represents  thef requency of the character  as f irst cr i -terion.
Axis  Y represents  the number ofd i f ferent  words in which the same char-acter is used.
The graph shows thed i s t r ibut ion  of characters  in the text-books except KANJI.
Each character  onY=I is used for only  one word.
For in-stance, H IRAGANA ' & ' (o) on Y=i is usedfor only one word (one of case- JOSHI ,indicat ing accusat ive case) exclus ively.Each character  on Y=X is used for a newword in every occurrence of the char-acter.

Theseare often used for wr i t ing some parts ofinf lect ional  forms of verbs (e.g. '
%~'for ' ~ ', ' D' for ' 5~ ~ ', ' ~ '  for' ~ ' ) .  '
~)'(i), ' ~ ' (ka)  and ' < '(ku) are also often used for wr i t ingsome parts  of in f lect ional  forms ofadject ives.  '

'~ '(ta) on the upper r ightside is often used for JODOSHI of thepast tense. '
~ '(na) on the upper r ightside is often used for the init ial  syl-lable of JODOSHI of negative.Fig.6 and Fig.7 show the same in-vest igat ion  into the KANJI  of newspapers(the or ig inal  work was carr ied out byNomura).5Fig.6 shows the d is t r ibut ion  of (y)the so-cal led "TOYOKANJI"  selected bythe Japanese government  for dai ly  use in1946.
The upper r ight area on the graph I~8is occupied by the so-cal led educat iona l  %KANJI.
Each KANJI on Y=i is used onlyfor one word (e.g.
'~ '(tai) for '~{~'(taiho : arrest),  ' ~ '(bou) for ' ~ '(boueki : trade), '~  '(kai) for '~ '(kikai : machine)) .
The same as Fig.5,characters  used for persons' names arelocal ized near Y=X.Fig.7 shows the d is t r ibut ion  of 5~KANJI other than TOYOKANJI .
The most  ofcharacters  in upper r ight part of thegraph are the ones which are used forpersons' names or for place names.
(e.g.
'~  ' and ' ~'  for '~  ' (Euj isaki :person)' ~ '  for '~ '  (Fukuoka:place).4.
Pos i t ion of characters  in a wordFor the informat ion process ing ofJapanese sentences,  at first, it is im-portant  to f ind out word boundar ies  in acont inuous character  string.
If thereare some characters  which always come tothe init ial  pos i t ion or the f inal posi -t ion of a word, these characters  areavai lab le  to f ind the boundaries.Fig.8 shows the pos i t ion of charac-ters in words.
In the data of textbooks,there are 399 characters  which are usedfor more than 6 kinds of d i f ferentwords.
The characters  on X=i00 alwayscome to the init ial  pos i t ion of a word.The characters  on X=0 are never used atthe init ial  posit ion.
The characters  onY=i00 always come to the  f inal pos i t ionof a word.
The characters  on Y=0 arenever used at the f inal posit ion.KANJI, represented with dots, spreadover the area of Y~-X+i00 .
Namely, thevalue of X+Y are always greater  than orequal to i00~ In other words, rates ofthe init ial  pos i t ion plus f inal pos i t ionare always greater than or equal to 100%.It means that all KANJI  have a tendencyto be used for the init ial  pos i t ion orthe f inal pos i t ion or both pos i t ion (asa word of one character) of a word(short unit *).
Most KANJI  on Y = -X+100form only words of two KANJI.
The tend-ency or ig inates  in the compos i t ion  ofwords wr i t ten by KANJI.
This matter  wil lbe observed in sect ion 6.
The group ofH IRAGANA in the upper right area has atendency to be used for JOSHI.
KATAKANArepresented by '~' appear around theunder left area on the graph.
Wordswr i t ten in KATAKANA have re lat ive ly  longlength (See sect ion 6).
Therefore,  therates of the init ial  pos i t ion and thef inal pos i t ion are re lat ivery  decreased. _ ; .

Relat ion between word boundar iesand character  str ings(Simple Japanese grammar)N, J iN2J  ~ ... V. (i)Ni: NounJi : Case- JOSHI  for N~V : VerbA Japanese sentence fundamenta l lybelongs to pattern (i).
Many nouns (Ni)tend to be wr i t ten in KANJI (See nextsection).
Al l  the case- JOSHI  are writ -ten in HIRAGANA.
Stems of verbs are oftenwr i t ten in KANJI  and their inf lect ionalparts in HIRAGANA.
So both a phrase ofN~J& and V have such a pattern that theinit ial  pos i t ion is occupied by a KANJIand the f inal pos i t ion is occupied by aHIRAGANA.
Therefore,  the changing pointfrom HIRAGANA to KANJI  in a characterstring is always regarded as a wordboundary.
On the other hand, a wordboundary is not always a changing pointfrom HIRAGANA to KANJI.
One of theexcept ion is Japanese nouns (long unit)which are composed of some concatenat ionof nouns (short unit).
(See page 5 *)Fig.9 shows one of the re lat ionsbetween word boundar ies  and characterstrings.
The graph conta ins  902 KANJI(total : 1,546) in the textbooks.
The ax-is X represents  the rate that the chan-ging points from HIRAGANA to KANJI  cor-respond to word boundaries.
Each KANJIon X=i00 is cons idered as the init ialcharacter  of a word if it is preceededby a HIRAGANA.
The axis Y represents  therate that the word boundar ies correspondto changing points from HIRAGANA to KAN-JI.
The symbol of '~' represents  a KANJI.

Parts of speech and patternsof character  str ingsIn the invest igat ion of newspapers,20 parts of speech were assumed.
8 Eachpart of speech has a part icu lar  patternof character  str ings.
It is poss ib le  todecide the part of speech of a wordbased on the knowledge of such patternsin computer process ing of Japanese sen-tences.In Fig.10, 'K' in the column ofpattern represents  a KANJI, 'H' repre-sents a HIRAGAN~, and 'I' represents  aKATAKANA.
The left side of the bar chartshows the rate of total words.
The rightside of the bar chart  shows the rate ofd i f ferent  words.Fig.10-(1) shows the pattern ofcommon nouns.
The left side of the barchart  shows that KK-pattern  accounts for68.0% of total common nouns in the news-papers.
The right side of the bar chartshows that KK-pattern accounts for 68.5%of d i f ferent  common nouns in the news-papers.Fig.10-(2) shows the pat tern  ofproper nouns.
Most of the proper nounsalso have KANJI str ings.
The rest ofproper nouns have KATAKANA str ings ex-pressing foreign words.Fig.10-(3) shows the pattern ofverbal  nouns which change to verbs withsucceeding characters  ' ~ '  (se), ' 8' (sa)' b ' (sh i ) ,  ' ~ '  (su), ' ~ '(suru), ' ~ '(sure), '~ ' ( seyo) .
The verbal  nounsconsist  of KK-pattern up to 97.1% oftotal.
If KK-pattern and succeedingcharacters  ' ~ '(se),' ~ '(sa), ' L '(shi )...are found, such a character  stringcan be treated as a form of this kind.Fig.10-(4) shows the pattern ofverbs.
The verb of H-pattern is oftenused with preceding verbal  nouns.
Mostd i f ferent  verbs have KH-pattern.Fig.10-(5) shows the pattern ofadject ive.
Most of the adject ives arewr i t ten with KH-pattern  or KHH-pattern.Fig.10-(6) shows the pattern ofadverbs.
Most of the adverbs are wr i t tenwith HHH-pattern  or HHHH-pattern.
Namelythey are wr i t ten in HIRAGANA.7.
Relat ion between each characterand part of speechWe have assumed patterns of charac-ter str ings and the patterns are basi-cal ly  avai lable for c lass i f ing part ofspeech in actual  data.
However,  the pat-terns do not provide suf f ic ient  cr i ter iafor the c lass i f icat ion.

In orderto obtain more accurate results,we analyzed re lat ions between eachcharacter  and each part of speechin the data of newspaper (restric-tion : word - f requency  ~ 3).In F ig.

KANJI  on X=I00 areused for verbs in the all occur-rence of the last KANJI in a word.The re l iab i l i ty  of axis X increas-es according to the value of axisY.
In the lower area of the graph,the value on axis X seems to bed iscrete because of shortness ofthe data.8.
