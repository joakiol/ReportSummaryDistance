cornBACKGROUNDThe PRC Adaptive Knowledge-based Text Understanding System (PAKTUS) was develope das an Independent Research and Development project at PRC from 1984 through 1992 .
It includesa core English lexicon and grammar, a concept network, processes for applying these to lexical ,syntactic, semantic, and discourse analysis, and tools that support the adaptation of the generi ccore to new domains, primarily by acquiring sublanguage and domain-specific lexicon and topicpatterns.
The lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis components required little adaptation fo rMUC-5, the most significant change being conversion of the task-specific semantic representation sto object-oriented form .
The discourse analysis component was modified to operate on the task-specific semantic structures, rather than the generic case frames.APPROACHThe overall structure and operation of PAKTUS are shown in Figure 1 .
This is similar to the"generic system" described in [1] .
Processing proceeds mostly sequentially, with the exception o fthe interaction between the syntactic and semantic components at the clause and noun phrase level ,and between the lexical analysis and preprocessor.For the MUC5 task, we added some bracketing capabilities to handle the special syntacticphenomena in the financial application domain which might cause problems for the parser or late rextraction processes .
These phenomena include company name, currency, temporal expressions,and one percentage expression .
For example, "BRIDGESTONE SPORTS CO ."
,"BRIDGESTONE SPORTS TAIWAN CO" , "UNION PRECISION CASTING CO" and "TAG ACO."
are recognized as company names during the bracketing phase ; " 20 MILLION NEWTAIWAN DOLLARS" is bracketed as ((20000000 DOLLA RACURRENCY BASE C^TAIWAN)) ;and "75 PCT BY" is treated as a preposition .
The complete sentence parse rate for the MUC5corpus was significantly improved by the bracketing process, minimizing the need for complexadditions to the grammar .Unlike the generic system, PAKTUS has no text filter or preparser .
Full parses are attemptedon all sentences, and the first syntactico-semantically successful parse of a sentence is accepted .Parse time is restricted as a linear function of the number of words, however, and parse fragmentsare returned, implicitly conjoined, if a full parse cannot be produced in the allotted time .
Ful lparses were achieved for approximately 50 percent of the sentences in the MUC-5 corpus.
Usefu linformation was obtained from the fragmentary parses of the other half, however .
Based oncomparison of the MUC-5 error measures when fragmentary parses were included and excluded ,195the fragmented parses yielded, on average, about one-third as much correct information as the fulparses .Another variation on the generic system is that fragment combination and semanti cinterpretation are integrated in PAKTUS, and semantic interpretation is divided into two distinc tmodules : one that produces a generic representation of the complete sentence, and a subsequen tmodule that maps this into (possibly several) task-specific representations .
In addition, at thelexical analysis phase, as mentioned above, each word was associated with both syntactic an dsemantic information .
Lexical patterns were developed as an alternative to semantic interpretatio nbased on full syntactico-semantic parses .
This takes advantage of the information rich lexica lanalysis.
A pattern matcher uses the results of both the lexical analysis (as in Figure 2a) and thesyntactic analysis (as in Figure 3b) to extract information .
This is invoked when the extractionbased on full parsing fails to yield any data .
The patterns are defined as regular expressions tha tare matched against the results of lexical analysis.
When a match is found, the corresponding nou nphrases (produced by the full parser) are extracted and the task-specific semantic representation i sconstructed from these .PAKTUS has no separate lexical disambiguation module : that function is distributed across allsystem modules .
Initially, words are assigned all possible meanings available in the lexicon .Senses that are inconsistent with any processing choice are filtered out when that choice i sconsidered .Doc Template Preprocessor Words &SentencesSemanticSemanticSemanticFramesAnalysisStructures016ParserInternalReps & Link sGeneric-to-TaskTask-specificMappingStructuresReferenceResolutionTopics &BindingsOutpu tGeneratorFilledTemplate sLexicon &Morph RulesSyntacticStructuresSemanticMapping sOutputTemplate sFigure 1 : PAKTUS Modules and Control Flo wPROCESSING OF MUC-5 DOCUMENT 059 2Figure 2a shows the raw, unprocessed text of the first sentence (Si) of article number 0592 ,followed by its lexical analysis.
This is the result of applying both the preprocessor and lexica lanalysis modules .
Each word has one or more senses, represented as a root symbol, which i sgenerally the concatenation of the English token, the "^" character, and the PAKTUS lexica lcategory (e .g., "Set^Monotrans"), or as a simple structure involving a root, lexical category ,inflectional mark, and sometimes a conceptual derivation (e .g., the structure "(Say2^Monotran sL^Monotrans S^ed)" represents the -ed form of one sense of "say") .
For each word, all senses in196the PAKTUS lexicon are fetched or derived at this time ; disambiguation is generally delayed unti llater phases.
Many of the words are unknown to the PAKTUS lexicon; it will make guesses fromthe context.
An example of an ambiguous word is "concern."
Figure 2b shows some of thelexicon information for this word in PAKTUS .
This includes a list of the 4 PAKTUS primitivewords corresponding to the token "concern" plus objects containing information for each primitiv eword.
These objects are embedded in a semantic network; they inherit much additiona linformation from it.Sample PAKTUS grammar specifications relevant to S l are shown in Figure 3a, and th esyntactic analysis of this sentence is shown in Figure 3b .
This analysis is represented as aconfiguration of syntactic registers (the main ones are shown in the figure) and register fillers .
Thegrammar fragment of Figure 3a recognized the bound clause in Si (" .

.Several semantic frames that apply to S l are shown in Figure 4a, and the generic semanti canalysis of this sentence is shown in Figure 4b.
PAKTUS represents the semantic analysis as fivecase frames : one for the sentence, one for each of the three subordinate clauses (only two of whic hare displayed in the figure), and one for the "joint venture" NP .
The semantic rules are distribute din a network of objects like those in Figure 4a .Information is organized in several hundred conceptual objects (e.g ., CACREATE - the conceptfor "set up" in S l) and case roles (e .g., RARESULT - the thing created) .
Information about howto map from syntactic registers to case roles may be stored in concept frames, lexical frames, o rrole frames, along with semantic constraints on allowable fillers .
For example, the RARESULTrole of CACREATE is normally filled by the direct object (DO) register.
This information isinherited by RARESULT from the more general RAOBJECT role.BRIDGESTONE SPORTS CO .

This consists of a pattern component,which in this case matches the semantic frame of Figure 4b, and a mapping specification (in th e"slots" component) .
Figure 5b shows the task-specific semantic representation that results fro mapplying this mapping to the generic semantic frame.
The rule in Figure 5a is a refinement of oneused in the final test MUC-5 system.
The final test version recognized the tie up relationship i nthis sentence, but extracted only two of the three tie up entities .
The new mapping rule bette rillustrates system features without significantly changing the output .The pattern component specifies a semantic structure with a C ATALK concept as its root (theCAASSERT concept shown in the semantic analysis of S1 is a specialization of C ATALK inPAKTUS), and with RAAGENT and R^PROPOSITION roles.
The filler of the RAAGENT rolewill be bound to the pattern variable RAAGENT250 .
The R^PROPOSITION role must be fille dby an instance of a C ABEGIN frame (the CACREATE concept in S 1 is a specialization ofC^BEGIN), with a RARESULT that is an instance of C^ATTEMPT (which joint venture is) .
IfR^COMPANION or R APURPOSE roles are filled in the C^ATTEMPT frame, information i sextracted from them as well (they are optional, which is not indicated in the figure, but is marked i nthe actual mapping object).The mapping portion of the rule specifies how to map the pattern variable bindings to a task-specific semantic object.
This rule says that the result is a tie up relationship with tie up entitie sderived from the bindings of R ACOMPANION248 and RAAGENT250, the joint venture taken asthe filler of the RARESULT role of the CABEGIN frame, etc .
The type of relationship (existing ,former, etc .)
is determined by the act-stage function, which computes the type from tense, aspect ,and modality registers .199(P-TIE_UP_RELATIONSHIP14 3(AKO C^TALK )(R^AGENT ((> R^AGENT250)) )(R^PROPOSITION(P-TI E_UP_RELATIONSHIP14 4(AKO ((CON250 IS C^BEGIN)) )(R^INSTR ((< R^INSTR248)) )(R^RESULT(P-TIE_UP_RELATIONSHIP150(AKO ((CON249 IS C^ATTEMPT)) )(R^INSTR @P-TIE_UP_RELATIONSHIP150 )(R^COMPANION ((RACOMPANION248 IS L^AGENT)) )(R^PURPOSE(P-TIE_UP_RELATIONSHIP186(AKO ((CON248 IS C^CREATE)) )(R^INSTR ((R^INSTR248 IS L^3RD-PERS-PRO)) )(R^RESULT ((> R^RESULT248)))))) )(R^PLACE ((R^PLACE248 IS L^LOCATION)))) )(SLOTS(TIE_UP_RELATIONSHIP (TYPE (ACT-STAGE) )(TU-ENTITY R^COMPANION248 R^AGENT250 )(JOINT-VENTURE P-TIE_UP_RELATIONSHIP150 )(TU-ACTIVITY (INDUSTRY (I-TYPE PRODUCTION )(PRODUCT/SERVICE R^RESULT248) )(SITE R^PLACE248)) )(ENTITY (ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP (ENTITYI R^COMPANION248 R^AGENT250 )(ENTITY2 P-TIE_UP_RELATIONSHIP150 )(RELATIONSHIP CHILD)))) )Figure 5a: Generic-to-Task-Based Semantic Mapping Rul eFigure 5b shows the task-specific representation that the mapping rule in Figure 5a produce dwhen applied to the generic semantic representation of Figure 4b .Another task-specific representation is shown in Figure 6, for the fourth sentence : THE NEWCOMPANY, BASED IN KAOHSIUNG, SOUTHERN TAIWAN, IS OWNED 75 PCT BY BRIDGESTONE SPORTS, 15 PCT BYUNION PRECISION CASTING CO.

The MUC-5 version of the system wasincomplete at the time of the final testing .
All modules were functional, but many task-specificdetails were missing .
The system was ready for testing on the development corpus only tw oweeks prior to the final test .
Performance was improving rapidly ?
about one point per day .
Themain limiting factors for PRC were time and availability of people for development.
We directedmost of our energy toward the basic engineering, such as generating the template formats, whichleft little time to address the task-specific linguistic requirements .
This resulted in severeundergeneration, which accounted for most of the errors (73 percent undergeneration versus 8 3percent overall error rate) .Development Effor tFigure 9 enumerates our activities and level of effort in connection with the MUC-5 task, a swell as parallel non-Tipster-specific activities in developing our system .

Breakdown of Development Effor tMore than half of the development effort involved non-linguistic engineering of the system fo rMUC-5 requirements, such as the output template format generation.
We also needed to convertthe extraction components of the system to accommodate the object oriented nature of the MUC- 5templates.
This left us with one month of effort for task-specific linguistic development .
Thespecific changes and additions to the PAKTUS knowledge bases for MUC-5 are enumerated inFigure 10.
In parallel with the MUC-5 activity, we devoted 1 .9 months of effort to generi cdevelopment of our system, which may have had some impact on MUC-5 performance .Limiting FactorsThe two areas that could significantly improve performance with modest effort are thedefinition of task-specific semantic mappings and the output generator.
These are highlighted inFigure 11 .
Very little was done here, however, due to limited time and resources .
Only 147 of thesemantic mappings were defined .
We estimate that about 1,000 would be needed to map th egeneric linguistic data extracted by PAKTUS into the task-specific representations.
That wouldhave required about another month of effort .
Within the output generator module, which produce sthe final output template fills, many functions were incomplete or entirely absent .
These are no tdifficult to implement, but do require time and effort, which were not available .203Figure 10.
Additions/Modifications to PAKTUS Knowledge Bases for MUC- 5Figure 11 : What Would Improve Performance Quickly ?System TrainingThe PAKTUS modules were trained on varying parts of the MUC-5 corpus .
Thepreprocessing and lexical analysis modules were trained from concordances based on about 1,00 0documents .
This included the analysis of corporation names for bracketing .
The syntactic andsemantic analysis modules were largely unchanged, as noted above .
The little tailoring that wa sdone was based on a subset of the 86 documents in the dry run, part 1 set.
None of this trainin ginvolved analysis of any complete text, since these modules operate only at the sentence level o rbelow.
The careful analysis required for discourse analysis, including coreference resolution, wasperformed on only two documents : numbers 0099 and 0102 .
These were selected because 0099contained multiple tie up relationships, and the other contained a single tie up relationship wit hKnowledge TypeWords (Stems)TokensCompoundsIdiomsVerb categoriesNominal categoriesGrammar ArcsGrammar StatesConceptsSemantic MappingsDomain TemplateCore System14,81 618,92834388164042739038600New/ Mod for MUC-538781 11105009511471 1204some complex coreference phenomena.
This combination seemed to maximize coverage of th ephenomena the system had to deal with, within our very limited resource constraints .Reusability of the Syste mAlmost all of PAKTUS is generic and can be applied to other applications .
All of its processe sare at least partly generic, as illustrated in Figure 12 .
They operate on a set of object-orientedknowledge bases, some of which are generic (common English grammar, lexicon, and concep tframes) and some of which are task-specific (input and output templates, semantic mappings, an dtopic patterns) .
Even within the task-specific knowledge bases, however, the representatio nschemes are generic, and we have tools that facilitate building them .The primary tasks in applying PAKTUS to a new domain or improving its performance in a nexisting domain, are semantic mapping specification, and output generator function developmen tboth of which are relatively easy (compared to changing the grammar, for example) .Two other tasks that must be done, but only once for each new domain, are to specify the inpu tdocument formats and to identify the output specifications .
These are template-driven inPAKTUS.
For MUC-5 we converted the BNF specifications supplied by the Government totemplate format, which is quite simple .
We then added a function for each template slot to gatherinformation from our generic discourse data structures .
Additional information was includedregarding output formats, default fills, etc .
These templates are also used by a tool for buildin gsemantic mappings.Generic :Partly Generic : ?////VVV/iFigure 12: Generic, Reusable ComponentsLessons Learned from MUC-5We confirmed our belief that PAKTUS is robust and adaptable.
The more comple xcomponents (syntactic, semantic, and discourse analysis modules) are stable and competen tenough to apply the system to different domains and produce useful results, by adding domain -specific knowledge (lexicon and semantic mappings) .

This was done for only twodocuments for MUC-5 .
The full development corpus was used only to customize thepreprocessing and lexical analysis components .A task as complex as MUC-5 requires substantial investment in non-linguistic engineerin gbefore the linguistic capabilities of a system can be applied .
This detracts from linguisti cdevelopment that might otherwise have been done, and hides much of the linguistic competence o fthe system if the engineering is incomplete, as in our case (e .g., correct information was clearlyobtained, as in Figure 6, but not reported due to an incomplete output function) .
We recognize theneed for such engineering if useful applications are to be achieved, but hope that this process i sstandardized quickly so that it does not need to be completely reimplemented for each ne wapplication .REFERENCE[1] Hobbs, J .
