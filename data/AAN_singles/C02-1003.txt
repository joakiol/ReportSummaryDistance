Learning Chinese Bracketing Knowledge Based ona Bilingual Language ModelYajuan L?, Sheng Li, Tiejun Zhao, Muyun YangSchool of Computer Science & Engineering, Harbin Institute of TechnologyHarbin, China, 150001Email: {lyj,lish,tjzhao,ymy}@mtlab.hit.edu.cnAbstractThis paper proposes a new method forautomatic acquisition of Chinese bracketingknowledge from English-Chinese sentence-aligned bilingual corpora.
Bilingual sentencepairs are first aligned in syntactic structure bycombining English parse trees with astatistical bilingual language model.
Chinesebracketing knowledge is then extractedautomatically.
The preliminary experimentsshow automatically learned knowledgeaccords well with manually annotatedbrackets.
The proposed method isparticularly useful to acquire bracketingknowledge for a less studied language thatlacks tools and resources found in a secondlanguage more studied.
Although this paperdiscusses experiments with Chinese andEnglish, the method is also applicable toother language pairs.IntroductionThe past few years have seen a great success inautomatic acquisition of monolingual parsingknowledge and grammars.
The availability oflarge tagged and syntactically bracketed corpora,such as Penn Tree bank, makes it possible toextract syntactic structure and grammar rulesautomatically (Marcus 1993).
Substantialimprovements have been made to parse westernlanguage such as English, and many powerfulmodels have been proposed (Brill 1993, Collins1997).
However, very limited progress has beenachieved in Chinese.Knowledge acquisition is a bottleneck forreal appication of Chinese parsing.
While somemethods have been proposed to learn syntacticknowledge from annotated Chinese corpus, mostof the methods depended on the annotated orpartial annotated data(Zhou 1997, Streiter 2000).Due to the limited availbility of Chineseannotated corpus, tests of these methods are stillsmall in scale.
Although some institutions anduniversities currently are engaged in buildingChinese tree bank, no large scale annotatedcorpus has been published until now because thecomplexity in Chinese syntatic sturcture and thedifficulty in corpus annotation (Chen 1996).This paper proposes a novel method tofacilitate the Chinese tree bank construction.Based on English-Chinese bilingual corpora andbetter English parsing, this method obtainsChinese bracketing information automatically viaa bilingual model and word alignment results.The main idea of the method is that we mayacquire knowledge for a language lacking a richcollection of resources and tools from a secondlanguage that is full of them.The rest of this paper is organized asfollows : In the next section, a bilingual languagemodel is introduced.
Then, a bilingual parsingmethod supervised by English parsing isproposed in section 2.
Based on the bilingualparsing, Chinese bracketing knowlege isextracted in section 3.
The evaluation anddiscussion are given in section 4.
We concludewith discussion of future work.1 A bilingual language model ?
ITGWu (1997) has proposed a bilingual languagemodel called Inversion Transduction Grammar(ITG), which can be used to parse bilingualsentence pairs simultaneously.
We will give abrief description here.
For details please refer to(Wu 1995, Wu 1997).The Inversion Transduction Grammar is abilingual context-free grammar that generatestwo matched output languages (referred to as L1and L2).
It also differs from standard context-freegrammars in that the ITG allows right-hand sideproduction in two directions: straight or inverted.The following examples are two ITGproductions:C -> [A B]C -> <A B>Each nonterminal symbol stands for a pair ofmatched strings.
For example, the nonterminal Astands for the string-pair (A1, A2).
A1 is asub-string in L1, and A2 is A1?s correspondingtranslation in L2.
Similarly, (B1, B2) denotes thestring-pair generated by B.
The operator [ ]performs the usual concatenation, so that C -> [AB] yields the string-pair (C1, C2), where C1=A1B1and C2=A2B2.
On the other hand, the operator <>performs the straight concatenation for language1 but the reversing concatenation for language 2,so that C -> <A B> yields C1=A1B1, but C2=B2A2.The inverted concatenation operator permits theextra flexibility needed to accommodate manykinds of word-order variation between sourceand target languages (Wu 1995).There are also lexical productions of thefollowing form in ITG:A -> x/yThis means that a symbol x in language L1 istranslated by the symbol y in language L2.
x or ymay be a null symbol e, which means there maybe no counterpart string on other side of thebitext.ITG based parsing matches constituents foran input sentence-pair.
For example, Figure 1shows an ITG parsing tree for anEnglish-Chinese sentence-pair.
The invertedproduction is indicated by a horizontal line in theparsing tree.
The English text is read in the usualdepth-first left to right order, but for the Chinesetext, a horizontal line means the right sub-tree istraversed before the left.
The generated parsingresults are:(1) [[[Mr. Wu]BNP [[plays basketball]VP [onSunday ]PP ]VP ]S .
]S(2) [[[ ] [ [ 	]]]]We can also represent the common structureof the two sentences more clearly and compactlywith the aid of <> notation:(3)  [[<Mr./ Wu/>BNP < [plays/ basketball/	]VP[on/e Sunday/]PP >VP ]S ./]Swhere the horizontal line from Figure 1corresponds to the <> level of bracketing..SBNPVPPPVPMr./ Wu/plays/ basketball/on/e Sunday/S./Figure 1  Inversion transduction Grammar parsingAny ITG can be converted to a normal form,where all productions are either lexicalproductions or binary-fanout nonterminalproductions(Wu 1997).
If probability isassociated with each production, the ITG iscalled the Stochastic Inversion TransductionGrammar (SITG).2 English parsing supervised bilingualbracketingBecause of the difficulty in finding a suitablebilingual syntactic grammar for Chinese andEnglish, a practical ITG is the generic BracketingInversion Transduction Grammar (BTG)(Wu1995).
BTG is a simplified ITG that has only onenonterminal and does not use any syntacticgrammar.
A Statistical BTG (SBTG) grammar isas follows:jbibjibaaveAeuAvuAAAAAAAejieij/    ;/; /    ;    ];[?????????><?????
?SBTG employs only one nonterminalsymbol A that can be used recursively.
Here, ?a?denotes the probability of syntactic rules.However, since those constituent categories arenot differentiated in BTG, it has no practicaleffect here and can be set to an arbitrary constant.The remaining productions are all lexical.
bij isthe translation probability that source word uitranslates into target word vj.
bij can be obtainedusing a statistical word-translation model(Melamed 2000) or word alignment(L?
2001a).The last two productions denote that the word inone language has no counterpart on other side ofthe bitext.
A small constant can be chosen for theprobabilities bie and bej.In BTG, no language specific syntacticgrammar is used.
The maximum-likelihoodparser selects the parse tree that best satisfies thecombined lexical translation preferences, asexpressed by the bij probabilities.
Because theexpressiveness characteristics of ITG naturallyconstrain the space of possible matching in ahighly appropriate fashion, BTG achievesencouraging results for bilingual bracketingusing a word-translation lexicon alone (Wu1997).Since no syntactic knowledge is used inSBTG, output grammaticality can not beguaranteed.
In particular, if the correspondingconstituents appear in the same order in bothlanguages, both straight and inverted, then lexicalmatching does not provide the discriminativeleverage needed to identify the sub-constituentboundaries.
For example, consider anEnglish-Chinese sentence pair:(4) English: That old teacher is our adviser.Chinese: Using SBTG, the bilingual bracketing result is :(5) [[[[[[The/ old/] teacher/] is/] our/	]adviser/] ./]The result is not consistent with theexpected syntactic structure.
In this case,grammatical information about one or both of thelanguages can be very helpful.
For example, if weknow the English parsing result shown in (6),then the bilingual bracketing can be determinedeasily; the result should be (7).
(6) [[That old teacher]BNP [is [our adviser]BNP ]VP .
]S(7) [[That/ old/ teacher/] [is/ [our/adviser/] ] ./]From the example, we can see that if onelanguage parser is available, the inducedbilingual bracketing result would be moreaccurate.
English parsing methods have beenwell studied and many powerful models havebeen proposed.
It will be helpful to make use ofEnglish parsing results.
In the following, we willpropose a method of bilingual bracketingsupervised by English parsing.Here, English parsing supervised BTGmeans using an English parser?s bracketinginformation as a boundary restriction in the BTGlanguage model.
But this does not necessitateparsing Chinese completely according to thesame parsing boundary of English.
If the Englishparsing structure is totally fixed, it is possible thatthe structure is not linguistically valid forChinese under the formalism of InversionTransduction Grammar.
To illustrate this, see theexample shown in Figure 2.If you want to lose weight, you had better eat less bread .    eatless breadVPBNP(a)VPeat/ less/bread/X(b)Figure 2  A example of mismatch subtreeVPeat less bread(c)The sub-tree for blacked underlined part ofEnglish and corresponding Chinese are shown inFigure 2(a).
We can see that the Chineseconstituents do not match the Englishcounterparts in the English structure.
In this case,our solution is that: the whole English constituentof ?VP?
is aligned with the whole Chinesecorrespondence; i.e., ?eat less bread?
is matchedwith ??
shown in Figure 2(b).
At thesame time, we give the inner structure matchingaccording to ITG regardless of the Englishparsing constraint.
An ?X?
tag is introduced toindicate that the sub-bilingual-parsing-tree is notconsistent with the given English sub-tree.
Ourresult can also be understood as a flattenedbilingual parsing tree as shown in Figure 2(c).This means that when the bilingual constituentscouldn?t match in the small syntactic structure,we will match them in a larger structure.The main idea is that the given Englishparser is only used as a boundary constraint forbilingual parsing.
When the constraint isincompatible with the bilingual model ITG, weuse ITG as the default result.
This processenables parsing to go on regardless of somefailures in matching.We heuristically define a constraint functionFe(s, t) to denote the English boundary constraint,where s is the beginning position and t is the end.There are three cases of structure matching:violate match, exact match and inside match.Violate match means the bilingual parsingconflicts with the given English bracketingboundary.
For example, given the followingEnglish bracketing result (8), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3),(2,4) etc.
are Violate matches.
We assign aminimum Fe(s, t) (0.0001 at present) to preventthe structure match from being chosen when analternative match is available.
Exact matchmeans the match falls exactly on the Englishparsing boundary, and we assign a high Fe(s, t)value (10 at present) to emphasize it.
(1,6), (2,5),(3,5) are examples.
(3,4), (4,5) are examples ofinside match, and the value 1 is assigned to theseFe(s, t) functions.
(8) [She/1 [is/2 [a/3 lovely/4 girl/5] ] ./6]Let the input English and Chinese sentencesbe Tee ,...1  and Vcc ,...1 .
As an abbreviation wewrite tse ...  for the sequence of wordstss eee ..., ,21 ++ , and similarly write vuc ... .
The localoptimization function =),,,( vuts?]/[max....
vuts ceP denotes the maximum probabilityof sub-parsing-tree of node q and that both thesub-string tse ...  and vuc ...  derive from node q.Thus, the best parser has theprobability ),0,,0( VT?
.
),,,( vuts?
is calculated asthe maximum probability combination of allpossible sub-tree combinations(Wu 1995).
Toinsert English parsing constraints in bilingualparsing, we integrate the constraint function Fe(s,t) into the local optimization function.Computation of the local optimization function isthen modified as given below:.),,,(),,,(),(max),,,(,),,,(),,,(),(max),,,(,)],,,(),,,,(max[),,,(0))(())((0))(())(([][]UutSvUSstsFvutsvUtSUuSstsFvutsvutsvutsvutseUvuUStsSvUutSseUvuUStsSvUutSs????????????+??????<>???+?????

?where, T ,V is the length of English and Chinesesentence respectively.
)/( vt ceb is the probabilityof translating English word te  into Chinese wordvc .
A minimal probability can be assigned toempty word alignment b( eet / ) and b( vce / ).The optimal bilingual parsing tree for agiven sentence-pair can be computed usingdynamic programming (DP) algorithm(Wu 1997).Using the standard SBTG local optimizationfuction, the obtained bilingual parsing result forthe given sentence-pair(4) is shown as example(5); when using the above modified localoptimization function, the parsing result is thatshown as example (7).
Comparing the two results,we can see that by intergrating English parsingconstraints into BTG, the bilingual parsingbecomes more grammatical.
Our experimentsshowed that this English parsing supervised BTGwould improve the accuracy of bilingualbracketing by nearly 20% (L?
2001b).The obtained bilingual parsing tree is in thenormal form of ITG, that is each node in the treeis either a lexical node or a binary-fanoutnonterminal node.
We can combine the subtree torestore the fanout flexibility using the productioncharacters [[AA]A]=[A[AA]]=[AAA] and<<AA>A>= <A<AA>>=<AAA>.
The combiningoperation could not cross the given Englishparisng boundary.3 Chinese bracketing knowledge extractionTable 1 shows some bilingual bracketingexamples obtained using the above method.
Tounderstand easily, we give the tree form of thefirst example in Figure 3(a).
The leaf node is thealigned words of the two languages and theirPOS tag categories.
These POS tags aregenerated from an English and a Chinese POStagger respectively.
The English POS tag andphrase tag set are the same as those of the PennTree Bank (Marcus 1993) and the Chinse POStag set please refer to the web site:http://mtlab.hit.edu.cn.
The nonterminal node arelabeled using English sub-tree tags.Based on the bilingual parsing result, it iseasy to extract the Chinese bracketing structureaccording to the Inversion TransductionGrammar.
For the normal node, the Chinese textis traversed in depth-first left to right order, butfor an inverted node (indicated by a horizontalline in the parsing tree or indicated by a <>notation in bracketing expression), the rightsub-tree is traversed before the left.
Thus, theChinese parsing tree corresponding to Figure 3(a)is shown in Figure 3(b).
The nonterminal labelsare derived from the English sub-tree.

For example, in Table 2,the English tags ?PP (preposition phrase)?
insentence 1 and ?SBAR(clause)?
in sentence 4  areincorrectly tag the corresponding Chinesestructure.
We don?t care about the phrase tagshere.
Our main concern is the bracketingboundary of the syntactic structure.
Thebracketing boundary knowledge has been provedto be valuable for Chinese grammar induction(Zhou 1997).
The advantage of our method is thatthe bracketing knowledge is acquired frombilingual corpus automatically.
It reduces themanual labour for corpus tagging, which aretime-consuming and error-prone.4 Evaluation and discussionTo evaluate the quality of the acquired Chinesebracketing boundaries, we compared them withthe parsing annotation based on an existedChinese syntax annotation scheme.
Detail of theChinese syntax annotation scheme and aannotated corpus can be download from thewebsite http://mtlab.hit.
edu.cn.The test set consisted of 3,000English-Chinese bilingual sentence-pairs thatcome from the machine translation evaluationcorpus(Duan 1996).
The average length is 9.1words for English sentences and 12.6 Chinesecharacters for Chinese sentences.
The testsentence pairs were first aligned at the word levelbased on statistics and  lexicon with a accuracy ofnearly 90%(L?
2001a).
The English and Chinesesentences were parsed based on the Penn Treebank tag set and the Chinese syntax annotationscheme respectively.
Both the English and theChinese parsing results were manually corrected.The corrected Chinese parsing results are used asthe standard test set.We acquired Chinese bracketing resultsusing the proposed method.
The previous definedexact match , violate match, and inside match areused to evaluate the accordance betweenacquired bracketing result and the standardparsing result.
Here, exact match means theacquired structure are the same as the standardstructure; violate match means the acquiredstructure conflict with the standard structure.Otherwise, the acquired structure is called ainside match.
In example (9), A is the standardbracketing result, B is the acquired bracketingresult and C demonstrates the classification of theacquired structures.
The structure of wholesentence are not participate in evaluation.
Exactmatch rate(EMR), violate match rate(VMR), andinside match rate(IMR) denote the ratio of threetypes of bracketing numbers in all bracketingnumbers respectively.

Theevaluation results for acquired Chinese structurecorresponding to six main English phrases (BNP,NP, VP, ADJP, ADVP and PP) are also given indetail.From the results we can see that only afraction of the learned structures are violatematch(14.03%), most of them are exact match(55.46%).
In addition, there are also many insidematch.
These inside matches occured due to thedifference standard in phrase merging betweenPenn Tree bank and the standard Chineseannotation scheme.
The English phrase structureare labeled with more details.
While for Chinese,the main phrase in the level of sentence are notmerged futher.
For example, the verb and objectin sentence level are not combined.
That is whymost of the verb phrases(VP) are inside match(53.28%).
The bracketing boundary of insidematch can be either right or wrong.
We checkedthe correctness of inside match manually and gota average accuray of 79.37%.
Then the accuracyof all acquired structure bracketing is 79.68%(EMRIMR Accuracy of IM).The violate matches acquired in bilingualparsing are mainly due to the empty wordalignments.
Such as in the special strucures?
F ...?
and ?
G ...?
in Chinese.
The word?
F ?
and?
G ?
has no counterpart word inEnglish.They are usually merged with theneighboring noun word as shown in example(10)thus lead to a violate match.
It is neccessaryto build special patterns to handle these structures.Word alignment errors also produce violatematches in bilingual bracketing.
(10) [[F/p H/r I/ng] [JK/vg [L/vg [	/r MN/vg ]]]/wj ]The Chinese bracketing accuracy obtainedusing our method is comparable to that  of theexample-based Chinese parser(77%) ( Streiter2000), but it is lower than that of  the PCFGChinese parser(84%)(Yao1998).
However,unlike these two parser, our method needn?t anyTable 3  Evaluation on acquired Chinese bracketing resultsType Bracket number EMR IMR VMR Accuracy of IM Accuracyall 10119 55.46% 30.51% 14.03% 79.37% 79.68%BNP 2533 71.69% 18.95% 9.36% 49.58% 81.09%NP 675 65.63% 20.30% 14.07% 70.80% 80.00%VP 1676 28.46% 53.28% 18.26% 92.72% 77.86%ADJP 192 60.94% 26.04% 13.02% 86.00% 83.33%ADVP 120 45.83% 38.33% 15.83% 76.09% 74.99%PP 1198 52.92% 27.46% 19.62% 82.67% 75.62%Chinese annotated training corpus, which isdifficult to accumulate.
Another advantage of ourmethod is that the Chinese bracketing result isderived based on English parsing and parallelcorpus, which make it particularly benefit forresearch on the corresponding relationshipbetween Chinese and English phrase.
In (L?2001b), we used bilingual bracketing result forautomatic translation templates acquisition,which turns out to be very useful for structuretransfer in machine translation.
In addition, theacquired bracketing corpus can be applied tomany Chinese NLP tasks.
It can be used as thefoundation for further Chinese treebankannotation, which will save human labour in agreat deal.
It can also be used to improve theefficiency and accuracy in Chinese grammarinduction (Zhou 1997).
Grammar rules can alsobe extracted from the bracketing corpus.
Forexample, we can obtain the following BNP rulesfrom the acquired bracketing results in Table 2:BNP->nx+nc;    BNP->r+ng;     BNP->m+q;BNP->m+q+ng;  BNP->r+m+ng;  BNP->ny+usde+ng;BNP->nd+ng;    BNP->a+usde+ng;ConclusionIn this paper, we have presented a method tolearn Chinese syntactic structure from Englishparsing based on a bilingual language model.
Themethod creates structure bracketing Chinesecorpora automatically by taking full advantage ofEnglish parsing and bilingual corpora.
Thecreated corpora are very useful for furtherChinese corpus annotation and parsingknowledge acquisition.
Primary experimentproved the feasibility and validity of the method.Although this paper is related to Chinese andEnglish, the method is also applicable to otherlanguage pairs.
Obviously, if the concernedlanguages come from same language family,such as English and French, the method would bemore effective.AcknowledgementsThis research was funded by High TechnologyResearch and Development Program of China(2001AA114101).
