Investments in Educationbrought a good development of several higher edu-cational institutions, most of them public and opento new students through an academic selection sys-tem.
As a consequence, one of the main products ofexportation is software (outsourcing, for example).The growing importance of Computational Linguis-tics (CL) in the last years has made developers tostart using CL technologies at work, but unfortu-nately, often, they are on their own for the lack ofacademic structures supporting development.
In theTable 1 and in the Figure 1 we provide comparativedata on Information and Communication Technolo-gies (ICT) for Costa Rica, Brazil, Mexico and theUnited States both taken from the World EconomicReport for 2010 (Dutta and Mia, 2010), in order tohelp the reader to get a better picture of the contexton which CL is growing up in Costa Rica.This paper aims to bring a general account of CLin Costa Rica.
This article is divided into three parts.?

All the gapsand mistakes in this paper are entirely mine.The section 2 starts with some early CL articles inCosta Rica before covering academic and researchinfrastructure in the country.
The section 4 brieflyacknowledges the presence of CL industries in thecountry.
Finally, the section 5 presents some of thecurrent tendencies in research and teaching.
Theclaims in this paper are not exhaustive and they onlyrepresent the Author?s opinion, who aims to be asobjective as possible, but who does not have a com-plete knowledge on the structures, institutions andcompanies involved in computational issues in CostaRica.
Therefore, all the topics are raised from per-sonal interviews and experiences .2 Academic infrastructureSince the 90?s, CL raised interest in main academicinstitutions in Costa Rica, particularly in the field ofArtificial Intelligence, but this interest was not con-tinued and well structured in time.
Some researchersmoved to other academic areas in computation oreven to industrial research.
So, in the Instituto Tec-nol?gico de Costa Rica1 (TEC) we found the firstcitations related to CL, mainly on number recogni-tion (Helo and Sell, 1995), knowledge representa-tion (Araya, 1992), connectionism (Vargas, 1991)and unification grammars (Vargas, 1992), these lastfrom a philosophical perspective.In Costa Rica, we found more than 40 universitiesand research institutes.
But, computational researchin the country is principally done in the TEC and inthe University of Costa Rica.2 At this moment, CL1Web site: http://www.tec.cr/.

This institution, asfar as we are concerned, has two structures cover-ing research: schools and research institutions.
Theformer are mainly oriented towards teaching; the lat-ter are exclusively devoted to research.
CL teachingis carried out in the School of Philology, Linguis-tics and Literature3 and in its associated postgrad-uate program on Linguistics4.
Research is concen-trated in the Instituto de Investigaciones Ling?
?sticas(INIL)5 at the Facultad de Letras6.
INIL is underthe administrative supervision of the Vicerrector?ade Investigaci?n7, which approves project financing.All the scientific responsability falls on the membersand commissions of the research institutions.
At thismoment, CL is attached to INIL?s program ELEX-HIC?S.
Where a two year project is under develop-ment, with the part time assistance of a researcher.This project aims to create the bases for a hybridtutions.3Escuela de Filolog?a, Ling?

In spite of the name, their research ad-dresses mostly behavioral issues.There exists the possibility of getting fundingfrom governmental institutions, like CONARE9, butthey are meager.
Nevertheless, it seems there aregood options within inter-university collaboration,but this would require a long term coordination andplanification.In Costa Rica, research funding can be improvedif real applications are proposed, for example edu-cational and developmental tools.
Other areas of in-terest are indigenous and minority languages, likeBribri and Chinese.
In this sense, there are no com-putational projects officially inscribed in INIL at thismoment, but ideas to start projects on this areas arewaiting for the next inauguration of the Natural Lan-guage Processing Laboratory in the University ofCosta Rica, so there are no papers to cite for the mo-ment.
Nevertheless, any inquiry on indigenous lan-8Site: http://iniiserver.inii.ucr.ac.cr/picl/.

The need of computationalresources was felt from the beginning of ELEX-HIC?S.
The Murillo and S?nchez (1993) on lexi-cal and syntactic maturity (language acquisition) isa good example of a research where this need oflanguage computational tools is present.
However,statistical dictionaries (Morales, 2009) can only bedone by electronic means because of the huge cal-culations involved.
For a long time, ELEXHIC?Scounted on the limited, but important, support of theCentro de Inform?tica (Center of Informatics) of theUniversity of Costa Rica, but the need of developingits own resources and technologies imposed itself.In 2002 the School of Philology, Linguisticsand Literature of the University of Costa Ricaopened the course Tecnolog?a y Producci?n Tex-tual12, where text processing technologies likeLATEX, XML, HTML, CSS and Perl are taught forapplications in the Humanities field.
Some interest-ing proof-of-concept projects have been proposed aspart of the course activities (Arroyo Molina, 2009;Enciso Bahler, 2008; Fuentes Vargas, 2008).
Asan initiative of ELEXHIC?S and the School ofPhilology, Linguistics and Literature in order to de-velop CL, the University of Costa Rica approveda grant for a Ph.D. on Computational Linguistics,which was fulfilled at the Laboratoire d?Analyse etde Technologie du Langage13 of the University of10In Spanish Studies on Hispanic-Costarican Lexicography.11Site: http://www.lexicografia.ucr.ac.cr.

Visited: 02/10/2010.Geneva.
As part of this initiative a full time Profes-sorship on CL was opened for 2010 and since 2009CL is taught as postgraduate facultative course forthe Master on Linguistics.
Other courses on FormalLinguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP)were accepted and will be part of the offer in 2010.Additionally, the School of Philology, Linguisticsand Literature approved the creation of a NLP labo-ratory (project number 021-A9-734 of the Vicerrec-tor?a de Investigaci?n, main resarcher, Prof. JorgeAntonio Leoni de Le?n, assistant researcher, Prof.Carla Jara Murillo), which is expected for 2010, andshould support research and teaching, especially be-cause a course on data processing for undergraduatestudents on Linguistics and Philology is under con-sideration.Computational graduate students have showedtheir interest on CL courses at the Postgraduate Pro-gram in Linguistics14.
Some of them come to thecourse looking for knowledge on CL, since becauseof their jobs they need a good understanding of NLPtechnologies.
Although we lack of details about thejob they do with NLP, the works of Berrocal Rojas(2009) and Cede?o Baltodano (2009) for the post-graduate program on Computational Sciences illus-trate the growing interest in the field.
At the mo-ment, only one student started, this year, her Mas-ter?s thesis on CL at the Postgraduate Program onLinguistics at the University of Costa Rica.Off universities?
campus, it?s important to men-tion the Centro Nacional de Alta Tecnolog?a15 (CE-NAT), which has projects sharing similarities withCL, but with totally different aims.
For example, wecan cite the projects on human memory modelisa-tion (in collaboration with the Programa de Investi-gaciones en Fundamentos de la Educaci?n a Distan-cia, PROIFED, UNED) and an adaptation of com-putational learning methods to a parallel and dis-tributed processing platform.
CENAT has contactswith several organizations at international level.
CE-NAT is a state inter-university research institution onsuper computation.14Site: http://www.linguistica.ucr.ac.cr/.
Visited:02/15/2010.15National Center of High Technology.434 Commercial application of LanguageTechnologiesWe are aware of postgraduate students working inrelated areas in another countries, but we do not havedetails about their plans for the future.
Nevertheless,national industry has not waited to have graduatedspecialists in order to start the commercializationof NLP related software.
For example, WordmagicSoftware16 developed symbolic machine translationsoftware Spanish?English and Tecapro presented anorthographic correction software17.
Because of se-crecy in the industry, it is difficult to know how manycompanies appeal to NLP technologies.
Enterpriseare also make themselves present in the field by sci-entific grants, in 2007 Juan Rodr?guez won a prizeproposing a glove allowing translation between signlanguage and Natural Langue.185 Research interests and collaborationissuesPresently, the idea is that Computational Linguisticswould play a role, at different levels, in Lexicogra-phy and Spanish as a second language (L2).
Thisleads to the creation of parsing systems and largecorpora, where collaboration is desired.
Another in-teresting area for CL is dialectology, where the tradi-tion, as in Lexicography, of large collaborative ini-tiatives exists.
The new NLP laboratory will haveworkstations exclusively dedicated to research andthe creation and storage of large copora as an inten-sive international initiative could be possible.The signing of specific collaborative agreementsbetween academic institutions is the preferred wayto accomplish international research projects.
Thisfacilitates the approval of fundings.6 ConclusionsIn Costa Rica, CL is finding its path.
At this momentit is mainly an academic interest, but, as we saw,16Site: http://www.wordmagicsoft.com.

Visited: 03/28/2010.there already are industrial products, where, eventu-aly, graduated students could find professional em-ployment.In the University of Costa Rica, where CL israpidly growing up, collaborative initiatives are pos-sible in a specifc and well defined frame.
Addition-ally, many students are coming to CL, with the newacademic offer.
And this tendecy can increase in thenext years.In this moment, there is no CL community inCosta Rica.
Before we are able to build it, we need tocreate a solid ground where a CL community couldfirmly stand up.
This is starting to happen at theUniversity of Costa Rica, where individual initia-tives begin to gather around the recent course onCL taught by Prof. Jorge Antonio Leoni de Le?n.We hope this movement will continue with the nextopening of the NLP Laboratory at the School ofPhilology, Linguistics and Literature in the Univer-sity of Costa Rica.
This laboratory will fill the lackof equipment to make research on CL.
Nevertheless,the need of a permanent research group will be there.This is an understandable situation in the sense thatCL is a very new branch in the University and es-pecially in liberal arts.
This allows us to think thatstudents will incorporate to CL studies and projectsonce the equipment and the offer on courses will benormal.
It is expected that this year (2010), Schoolof Philology, Linguistics and Literature will have afull time professor on CL, who will dedicate at least14 of his time to research.AcknowledgmentsThanks to Vicerrector?a de Investigaci?n (http://vra.ucr.ac.cr/vra.nsf), the Instituto de InvestigacionesLing?
