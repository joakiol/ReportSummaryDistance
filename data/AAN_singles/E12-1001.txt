Proceedings of the 13th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, page 1,Avignon, France, April 23 - 27 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsSpeech Communication in the WildMartin CookeLanguage and Speech LaboratoryUniversity of the Basque CountryIkerbasque (Basque Science Foundation)m.cooke@ikerbasque.orgAbstractMuch of what we know about speech perception comes from laboratory studies with clean, canonicalspeech, ideal listeners and artificial tasks.
But how do interlocutors manage to communicate effec-tively in the seemingly less-than-ideal conditions of everyday listening, which frequently involve try-ing to make sense of speech while listening in a non-native language, or in the presence of competingsound sources, or while multitasking?
In this talk I?ll examine the effect of real-world conditions onspeech perception and quantify the contributions made by factors such as binaural hearing, visual in-formation and prior knowledge to speech communication in noise.
I?ll present a computational modelwhich trades stimulus-related cues with information from learnt speech models, and examine howwell it handles both energetic and informational masking in a two-sentence separation task.
Speechcommunication also involves listening-while-talking.
In the final part of the talk I?ll describe someways in which speakers might be making communication easier for their interlocutors, and demon-strate the application of these principles to improving the intelligibility of natural and synthetic speechin adverse conditions.1
