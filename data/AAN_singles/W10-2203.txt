Proceedings of the 11th Meeting of the ACL-SIGMORPHON, ACL 2010, pages 19?27,Uppsala, Sweden, 15 July 2010.c?2010 Association for Computational LinguisticsComplexity of the Acquisition of Phonotactics in Optimality TheoryGiorgio MagriInstitut Jean Nicod,?Ecole Normale Sup?erieure, Parismagrigrg@gmail.comAbstractThe problem of the acquisition of Phono-tactics in OT is shown to be not tractablein its strong formulation, whereby con-straints and generating function vary arbi-trarily as inputs of the problem.Tesar and Smolensky (1998) consider the ba-sic ranking problem in Optimality Theory (OT).According to this problem, the learner needs tofind a ranking consistent with a given set of data.They show that this problem is solvable even in itsstrong formulation, namely without any assump-tions on the generating function or the constraintset.
Yet, this basic ranking problem is too sim-ple to realistically model any actual aspect of lan-guage acquisition.
To make the problem more re-alistic, we might want, for instance, to require thelearner to find not just any ranking consistent withthe data, rather one that furthermore generates asmallest language (w.r.t.
set inclusion).
Prince andTesar (2004) and Hayes (2004) note that this com-putational problem models the task of the acquisi-tion of phonotactics within OT.
This paper showsthat, contrary to the basic ranking problem consid-ered by Tesar and Smolensky, this more realisticproblem of the acquisition of phonotactics is notsolvable, at least not in its strong formulation.
Iconjecture that this complexity result has nothingto do with the choice of the OT framework, namelythat an analogous result holds for the correspond-ing problem within alternative frameworks, suchas Harmonic Grammar (Legendre et al, 1990b;Legendre et al, 1990a).
Furthermore, I conjec-ture that the culprit lies with the fact that gener-ating function and constraint set are completelyunconstrained.
From this perspective, this papermotivates the following research question: to findphonologically plausible assumptions on generat-ing function and constraint set that make the prob-lem of the acquisition of phonotactics tractable.1 Statement of the main resultLet the universal specifications of an OT typologybe a 4-tuple (X ,Y, Gen, C), as illustrated in (1):X and Y are the sets of underlying and surfaceforms; Gen is the generating function; and C isthe constraint set.X = Y = {ta, da, rat, rad}Gen =?ta, da?

D. A data set D is called OT-compatible iff it is OT-compatible with at least aranking.
Suppose that the actual universal specifi-cations (X ,Y, Gen, C) are fixed and known.
The19basic Ranking problem (Rpbm) is (6).
The learneris provided with a set of data D corresponding tosome target language; and has to come up with aranking compatible with those data D.given: an OT-comp.

X ?
Y;find: a ranking over the constraint setC that is OT-compatible with D.(6)At the current stage of the development of thefield, we have no firm knowledge of the actualuniversal specifications.
Thus, the Rpbm (6) isof little interest.
It is standard practice in the OTcomputational literature to get around this diffi-culty by switching to the strong formulation (7),whereby the universal specifications vary arbitrar-ily as an input to the problem (Wareham, 1998;Eisner, 2000; Heinz et al, 2009).
Switching from(6) to (7) presupposes that the learner does not relyon peculiar properties of the actual universal spec-ifications.given: univ.

Y;find: a ranking over the constraint setC that is OT-compatible with D.(7)To complete the statement of the Rpbm (7), weneed to specify the size of its instances, that de-termines the time that a solution algorithm is al-lowed to take.
Let width(D) be the cardinality ofthe largest candidate set over all underlying formsthat appear in D, as stated in (8).width(D)def= max(x,y?
)?D|Gen(x)| (8)Of course, the size of an instance of the Rpbm (7)depends on the cardinality |C| of the constraint setand on the cardinality |D| of the data set.
Tesarand Smolensky (1998) (implicitly) assume that italso depends on width(D), as stated in (9).1given: univ.
specs (X ,Y, Gen, C),an OT-comp.
data set D ?
X ?
Y;find: a ranking of the constraint set Cthat is OT-compatible with D;size: max {|C|, |D|, width(D)}.
(9)1A potential difficulty with the latter assumption is asfollows: width(D) could be very large, namely super-polynomial in the number of constraints |C|; thus, letting thesize of an instance of the Rpbm depend on width(D) mightmake the problem too easy, by loosening up too much thetight dependence on |C|.
Yet, this potential difficulty is harm-less in the case of the strong formulation of the Rpbm, sincethat formulation requires an algorithm to work for any univer-sal specifications, and thus also for universal specificationswhere |C| is large but width(D) small.Tesar and Smolensky (1998) prove claim 1.
Thisclaim is important because it shows that no harmcomes from switching to the strong formulation,at least in the case of the Rpbm.Claim 1 The Rpbm (9) is tractable.Yet, the Rpbm (9) is way too simple to realisti-cally model any aspect of acquisition.
Here is away to appreciate this point.
The two rankingsand?in (2) are both solutions of the in-stance of the Rpbm (9) corresponding to the uni-versal specifications in (1) and to the data set in(5).
As noted in (4), the language correspond-ing to  is a proper subset of the language cor-responding to?.
A number of authors havesuggested that the ranking  that corresponds tothe subset language is a ?better?
solution than theranking?that corresponds to the superset lan-guage (Berwick, 1985; Manzini and Wexler, 1987;Prince and Tesar, 2004; Hayes, 2004).
This intu-ition is captured by problem (10): it asks not justfor any ranking OT-compatible with the data D;rather, for one such ranking whose correspondinglanguage is as small as possible (w.r.t.
set inclu-sion).
The latter condition requires the learner torule out as illicit any form which is not entailed bythe data.
Problem (10) thus realistically modelsthe task of the acquisition of phonotactics, namelythe knowledge of licit vs. illicit forms.given: univ.

(10)The Problem of the Acquisition of Phonotactics(APpbm) in (10) involves the language L(),which in turn depends on the number of formsin X and on the cardinality of the candidate setGen(x) for all underlying forms x?X .
Thus, (11)lets the size of an instance of the APpbm dependgenerously on |X | and width(X ), rather than on|D| and width(D) as in the case of the Rpbm (9).2given: univ.

(11)2Letting the size of an instance of the APpbm depend on|C|, |X | and width(X ) ensures that the problem is in NP ,namely that it admits an efficient verification algorithm.20Prince and Tesar (2004) offer an alternative for-mulation of the APpbm.
They define a strictnessmeasure as a function ?
that maps a ranking toa number ?

Consider the function ?PTde-fined in (13): it pairs a rankingwith the number?PT() of pairs of a faithfulness constraint and amarkedness constraint such that the former is-ranked above the latter.
Prince and Tesar (2004)conjecture that the function ?PTin (13) is a strict-ness measure.
The intuition is that faithfulness(markedness) constraints work toward (against)preserving underlying contrasts and thus a smalllanguage is likely to arise by having few pairs of afaithfulness constraint ranked above a markednessconstraint.
?PT()def= |{(F,M)?F?M|F M}| (13)Let me dub (12) with the mesure ?PTin (13)Prince and Tesar?s reformulation of the APpbm(PTAPpbm), as in (14).
The core idea of strictnessmeasures is to determine the relative strictness oftwo rankings without reference to the entire set offorms X .
Thus, (14) lets the size of an instanceof PTAPpbm depend on |D| and width(D), ratherthan on |X | and width(X ) as for the APpbm (11).given: univ.

(14)The APpbm (11) and the PTAPpbm (14) have fig-ured prominently in the recent computational OTliterature.
The main result of this paper is claim3The Rpbm (7) corresponds to Empirical Risk Minimiza-tion in the Statistical Learning literature, while problem (12)corresponds to a regularized version thereof, with regulariza-tion function ?.2.
This claim says that there is no efficient al-gorithm for the APpbm nor for the PTAPpbm.
Iconjecture that the culprit lies in the switch tothe strong formulation.
Comparing with claim1, I thus conclude that the switch is harmless forthe easy Rpbm, but harmful for the more realisticAPpbm and PTAPpbm.Claim 2 The APpbm (11) and the PTAPpbm (14)are intractable.In the next section, I prove NP-completeness ofPTAPpbm by showing that the Cyclic Orderingproblem can be reduced to PTAPpbm.
I then proveNP-completeness of APpbm by showing thatPTAPpbm can be reduced to it.
NP-completenessof APpbm holds despite the generous dependenceof its size on |X | and width(X ).
Furthermore, theproof actually shows that the PTAPpbm remainsNP-complete even when the data have the sim-plest ?disjunctive structure?, namely for each un-derlying/winner/loser form there are at most twowinner-preferring constrains.4And furthermoreeven when the data have the property that the faith-fulness constraints are never loser-preferring.2 Proof of the main resultGiven a data set D, for every pair (x, y?)
?
D ofan underlying form x and a corresponding winnerform y?, for every loser candidate y ?Gen(x) dif-ferent from y?, construct a row a with |C| entries asfollows: the kth entry is an L if constraint Ckas-signs more violations to the winner pair (x, y?)
thanto the loser pair (x, y); it is a W if the oppositeholds; it is an E if the two numbers of violationscoincide.
Organize these rows one underneath theother into a tableau A(D), called the comparativetableau corresponding toD.
To illustrate, I give in(15) the tableau corresponding to the data set (5).A(D) =[F FposMW W LW E W](15)Generalizing a bit, let A ?
{L, E, W}m?nbe atableau withm rows, n columns, and entries takenfrom the three symbols L, E or W, called a compar-ative tableau.
Let me say that A is OT-compatiblewith a ranking  iff the tableau obtained by re-ordering the columns of A from left-to-right in4Of course, if there were a unique winner-preferring con-straint per underlying/winner/loser form triplet, then the datawould be OT-compatible with a unique ranking, and thus thePTAPpbm would reduce to the Rpbm.21decreasing order according to has the propertythat the left-most entry different from E is a W inevery row.
Tesar and Smolensky (1998) note thata data set D is OT-compatible with a rankingiff the corresponding comparative tableau A(D)is OT-compatible with it.
Thus, the PTAPpbm(14) is tractable iff the problem (16) is tractable.Note that this equivalence crucially depends ontwo facts.
First, that the size of an instance of thePTAPpbm depends not only on |C| and |D|, butalso on width(D).
Second, that we are consider-ing the strong formulation of the PTAPpbm, andthus no assumptions need to be imposed on thegiven comparative tableau in (16), besides it beingOT-compatible.
The set F provided with an in-stance of (16) says which one of the n columns ofthe comparative tableau A correspond to faithful-ness constraints.
The size of an instance of prob-lem (16) of course depends on the numbers m andn of rows and columns of A.given: a OT-comp.

(16)The decision problem corresponding to (16) isstated in (17).
As it is well known, intractabilityof the decision problem (17) entails intractabilityof the original problem (16).
In fact, if the originalproblem (16) can be solved in polynomial time,then the corresponding decision problem (17) canbe solved in polynomial time too: given an in-stance of the decision problem (17), find a solutionof the corresponding instance of (16) and thenjust check whether ?PT() ?

(17)Let me now introduce the problem I will reduceto PTAPpbm.
Given a finite set A = {a, b, .

}with cardinality |A|, consider a set S ?
A?A ofpairs of elements of A.
The set S is called linearlycompatible iff there exists a one-to-one functionpi : A ?
{1, 2, .
.
.
, |A|} such that for every pair(a, b) ?
S we have pi(a) < pi(b).
It is useful tolet S be not just a set but a multiset, namely toallow S to contain multiple instances of the samepair.
The notion of cardinality and the subset re-lation are trivially extended from sets to multisets.Consider the problem (18), that I will call the Max-ordering problem (MOpbm).given: a finite set A,a multiset P ?
A?A,an integer k ?
|P |;output: ?yes?
iff there is a linearly compat-ible multiset S ?
P with |S| ?
k;size: max {|A|, |P |}.
(18)The PTAPpbm (17) is clearly in NP , namely itadmits a verification algorithm.
Claim 3 ensuresthat MOpbm (18) is NP-complete.
Claim 4 showsthat MOpbm can be reduced to PTAPpbm (17).
Ican thus conclude that PTAPpbm is NP-complete.Claim 3 The MOpbm (18) is NP-complete.5Proof.
The MOpbm is obviously in NP .
To showthat it is NP-complete, I need to exhibit an NP-complete problem that can be reduced to it.
Givena finite set A = {a, b, .

T either pi(a)< pi(b)< pi(c)or pi(b) < pi(c) < pi(a) or pi(c) < pi(a) < pi(b).Consider the Cyclic Ordering problem (COpbm)in (19).6Galil and Megiddo (1977) prove NP-completeness of COpbm by reduction from the3-Satisfability problem; the COpbm is problem[MS2] in (Garey and Johnson, 1979, p. 279).input: a finite set A;a set T ?
A?A?A;output: ?yes?
iff T is linearly cyclicallycompatible;size: |A|(19)Given an instance (A, T ) of the COpbm (19), con-sider the corresponding instance (A,P, k) of theMOpbm (18) defined as in (20).
For every triplet5A similar claim appears in (Cohen et al, 1999).6It makes sense to let the size of an instance of the COpbm(19) be just the cardinality of the setA.
In fact, the cardinalityof the set T can be at most |A|3.
On the other hand, it makessense to let the size of an instance of the MOpbm (18) dependalso on the cardinality of the multiset P rather than only onthe cardinality of the set A, since P is a multiset and thus itscardinality cannot be bound by the cardinality of A.22(a, b, c) in the set T , we put in the multiset Pthe three pairs (a, b), (b, c) and (c, a).
Further-more, we set the threshold k to twice the numberof triplets in the set T .
Note that P is a multisetbecause it might contain two instances of the samepair coming from two different triplets in T .P ={(a, b), (b, c), (c, a)???
(a, b, c) ?
T}k = 2|T |(20)Assume that the instance (A, T ) of the COpbmadmits a positive answer.
Thus, T is cyclicallycompatible with a linear order pi on A.
Thus, forevery triplet (a, b, c) ?
T , there are at least twopairs in P compatible with pi.
Hence, there is amultiset S of pairs of P with cardinality at leastk = 2|T | linearly compatible with pi,7namely theinstance of the MOpbm defined in (20) admits apositive answer.
Vice versa, assume that the in-stance (A,P, k) of the MOpbm in (20) admits apositive answer.
Thus, there exists a linear orderpi on A compatible with 2|T | pairs in P .
Sincethe three pairs that come from a given triplet areinconsistent, then each triplet must contribute twopairs to the total of 2|T | compatible pairs.
Hence,pi is cyclically compatible with all triplets in T .
Claim 4 The MOpbm (18) can be reduced to thePTAPpbm (17).Proof.
Given an instance (A,P, k) of the MOpbm,construct the corresponding instance (A,F ,K) ofthe PTAPpbm as follows.
Let n = |A|, ` = |P |;pick an integer d as in (21).d > (`?

There is a faith-fulness constraint F(i,j)for every pair (ai, aj)in the multiset P in the given instance of theMOpbm.
Markedness constraints come in twovarieties.
There are the markedness constraints7Note that, in order for the latter claim to hold, it is cru-cial that P be a multiset, namely that the same pair might becounted twice.
In fact, T might contain two different tripletsthat share some elements, such as (a, b, c) and (a, b, d).M1, .

Instep (31a), I have used the definition (22) of thethreshold K. In step (31b), I have used the hy-pothesis that the ranking  is a solution of theinstance (A, F , K) of the PTAPpbm and thus itsmesure ?PTdoes not exceed K. By (13), ?PT()is the total number of pairs of a faithfulness con-straint and a markedness constraint such that theformer is-ranked above the latter.
In step (31c),I have thus lower bounded ?PT() by only con-sidering those faithfulness constraints F(i,j)cor-responding to pairs (ai, aj) not in S. For eachsuch constraint F(i,j), we have MiMj, bythe definition (30) of S. Thus, F(i,j)needs tobe -ranked above Miin order to ensure OT-compatibility with the corresponding row of theblock A in (24).

I conclude that the MOpbm canbe reduced to the PTAPpbm.
Let me now turn to the APpbm (11).
Once again,in order to show that it is intractable, it is sufficientto show that the corresponding decision problem(32) is intractable.
In fact, if problem (11) can besolved, then (32) can be solved too: given an in-stance of the latter, find a solution  of the cor-responding instance of the problem (11) and thenjust check whether |L()| ?

with D s.t.
the correspond-ing language L() has cardinalityat most k;size: max {|C|, |X |, width(X )}.
(32)The APpbm (32) is clearly in NP , namely itadmits a verification algorithm.
The followingclaim 5 together with the NP-completeness ofPTAPpbm, entails that the APpbm is NP-completetoo, thus completing the proof of claim 2.Claim 5 The PTAPpbm (17) can be reduced to theAPpbm (32).Proof.
Given an instance (A, F , k) of thePTAPpbm (17), construct the corresponding in-stance ((X , Y, Gen, C), D, K) of the APpbm(32) as follows.
Let m and n be the number ofrows and of columns of the comparative tableauA; let ` be the cardinality of the set F ; let d =`(n?
`).

Thus, thereexists a ranking  OT-compatible with the com-parative tableau A such that ?PT() ?

Furthermore, the lan-guage L() corresponding to the ranking con-tains at most K = m + k + d surface forms,namely: the m surface forms y1, .

The same reasoningshows that the vice versa holds too.
