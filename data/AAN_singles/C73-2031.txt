\]~ENGT SIGURDFR.OM NUMBERS TO NUMERALS AND VICE VERSA1.
FROM MATHEMATICAL INTO LINGUISTIC REPRESENTATIONS -AND VICE VERSAUniversally used decimal representations, such as 5; 200; 856763;189200000 are rendered (written, pronounced) differently in differentlanguages.
The number 5 is tllus five in English, fern in Swedish, cinqin French, ketsmala in Koyukon, biyar in Hausa and nga: in Burmese.Numbers can furthermore be written differently in different mathemat-ical systems.
The number 5 is written V in the Roman system and 101in a system with base 2 (binary system).We will mainly be interested in the relations between the represen-tations of the decimal system and Swedish numerals.
Numerals in someother languages, uch as English, German, French, Danish, Burmese,Hausa and Urdu will be touched upon briefly.
In particular we are inter-ested in rule systems (algorithms) that automatically convert mathe-matical representations into linguistic representations (numerals) orvice versa.
Our interest in this area is part of a wider interest in Automat-ic Text Comprehension, 1 which in turn is part of the areas Automat-ical Language Translation and Artificial Intelligence.
The study isfocusing on problems that are due to the structure of numerals in (nat-ural) languages.
The technical problems that turn up when conversionrules are to be implemented on computer are not treated in this explor-atory study.The practical applications of rule systems that convert mathemati-cal representations i to numerals or vice versa are automatic devicesor robots of various types, e.g.
the "automatic stock market announc-er ", the "automatic cashier ", the "automatic accountant ", the1 This work is related to the project ATC (Automatic Text Comprehension) fThe Institute of Linguistics, University of Stockholm, which is supported by Humani-stiska Forskningsr?tdet.

The automatic telephone directorywould give you the number, if you furnish the name and address of aperson.
The system would have to identify the person by processes thatcorrepond to optical and manual search in a directory.
In the registerof the directory the system would find the number and could pronounceit according to rules to be discussed later.The automatic directory would require phonetic identification pro-cedures that have not been developed fully yet, at least not for largeinventories of possible messages.
In societies where numbers play anincreasing role - telephone numbers, registration umbers, addresses,social security numbers, bank account numbers, zip codes - systemsthat can identify and pronounce numbers are getting increasingly inter-esting.
Current experiences suggest hat any conversation with robotshas to take place within heavy constraints.Further examples of machines that could use the rule systems underdiscussion would include warning systems, systems that read the valuesof meters (temperature, altitude, humidity) aloud.
A system that readsthe speed of the car aloud or tells you the distance of an approachingcrossing etc.
in a mild but distinct voice might have certain advantagesin difficult raffic situations.
Presently almost all warning systems, traf-fic signs and signals, use optical signals.
If acoustic signals are used theyare not speech signals, only rings or buzzes.
The human voice and thehuman language may have a certain attraction to human beings.
Imag-ine the "speaking alarm clock" which tells you the time and readsthe temperature etc.
in an attractive (re)male voice available as an option.In most of the applications mentioned so far pronunciation has beeninvolved.
But systems of a simpler kind, which rewrite mathematical(decimal) number representations as numerals (in letters) would cer-tainly also be useful.
Banks and Post offices use numbers written bothin mathematical nd linguistic form, presumably because of the needfor redundancy and security.
This is at least the case in Sweden.
It isrequired that a number, e.g.
1055 be written with letters as wellas with figures.
But these are almost our only opportunities forwriting high numbers with letters.
(Numbers are generally writtenwith letters only if they are below ten or belong to the round numbers(see B. SIGURD, 1972)).
Many persons hesitate when they are to writenumbers with letters (words).
Swedes would for instance hesitate bet-ween ett tusen ferntiofem, ett-tusen-femtiofem, ett(t)usenfemtiofem, and tu-senfemtlofem.
Fortunately the banks do not require any special spelling(only that you add Kronor after).FROM NUMBERS TO NUMERALS AND VICE VERSA 431There are many previous tudies related to the problems under fo-cus here, e.g.
CORSTIUS (1968) where marly general problems are treat-ed starting from Dutch, and C.-CH.
ELERT (1970) where the morpho-logy of Swedish numerals is treated.
We have used presentations andanalyses of numerals in various languages.
But it is only for Swedishthat our rules are outlined in any detail.
The other languages are treat-ed to indicate what problems one would have to face in an automatictranslation system for numerals.
A system that translates between math-ematical representations and representations in Swedish, English,French, German (and a couple of other languages) will be implementedon computer in the near future.We will work with written forms in this study.
Unfortunately itis not the case that such representations could be run through a speechsynthesizer giving beautiful pronunciation.
Nor are there any speechrecognition devices that can render large or infinite inventories of spo-ken numerals as written ones presently.
A forthcoming study by DESERVA-LEIT.~O will shed light on the phonetic problems.
Till then thisexamination of some of the fundamental problems may be of someimportance.
Some issues of interest o theoretical linguistics will alsoturn up.2.
MATHEMATICAL AND LINGUISTIC REPRESENTATIONS OF NUMBERSRepresentations of numbers using digits (figures) will be calledmathematical representations, while representations using letters (sounds)organized in morphemes, words and phrases as other linguistic materialwill be called linguistic representations.
The number 123 is now writtenin mathematical representation.
The equivalent linguistic representa-tion in Swedish is (ett)hundratjugotre.
There are often alternative r pre-sentations within a language.
The number 123 could thus also be ren-dered: ett-tv,~-tre, tolv-tre, or ett-tjugotre.
It is above all in technical con-texts (telegraphy, telephony) that the latter types are used.
The diffe-rence has to do with difference in division.
In the first (normal) case thewhole row of digits is taken as a unit and the highest numeral (positionword) offered by the language (hundra) is used giving: (ett)hundra-tjugotre.
In the other (technical) cases the series of digits is divided intosmaller groups which are treated separately.
In the extreme case eachdigit is treated separately.We will call the different divisions of the group of digits differentfusion.
We can show the differences as follows: 123, 12 + 3, 1 + 23,432 BENGT SIGURD1 + 2 + 3.
The first case implies total fusion, since the whole seriesof digits is taken into consideration.
The last case implies no fusion;cases in between may be characterized as partial fusion.
We mightcall the case where the digits are treated separately spelling, since thisis the word used when a word is decomposed in letters and each letteris spoken separately.
In Swedish we could devise a new word siffrering(" digitalization ") as an equivalent of bokstavering and stavning whichmean rendering each letter by its name.
Spelling (bokstavering), e.g.rendering the word bad as be-a-de, is often used for names and otherwords with low redundancy.
Military forces would use special letternames with more redundancy, in Swedish for bad: Bertil, Adam, David.The following is a table showing mathematical nd linguistic repre-sentations of numbers.
The linguistic representations are Swedish nu-merals according to different fusion.
We are mainly interested in therelations between decimal representations and linguistic ones, but forsome lower numbers binary and t(oman representations are given.We will touch on the problem of pronouncing binary representationsbriefly.
The relations between Koman mathematical representationsand Latin numerals are interesting but very complicated, and we willnot suggest any conversion rules for those representations here.Mathematical Linguisticrepresentation representationNormal (total Technical (partialKoman Decimal fusion) or no fusion)I 2 tvd tvd(a)XI 11 elva at-atXII 12 tolv ett-tvdCCCIX 309 rrehundranio tre-noll-nio4378 fyratusentre- fyra-tre-sju-dtta,hundrasjuttio- fyrtiotre-sjuttio-dtta dtta121457 etthundratjugo- ett-tvd-ett-fyra-entusen fyra- fem-sju, tolv-fjorton-hundrafemtlo- femtiosju, etthundra-sju tjugoett-fyrahundra-femtiosju123456789 etthundratjugo- ett-tvd-tre-fyra-fem-tre millioner sex-sju-dtta-nio, ett-fyrahundrafemtio- hundratjugotre-fyra-sex tusen sju- hundrafemtiosex-sju-hundradttionio hundradttionioBinary1010111100FROM NUMBERS TO NUMERALS AND VICE VERSA 433The fundamental difference between fused and non-fused expres-sions is the presence of position words: -tio(-ton), hundra, tusen, million ...in fused forms.
The etymology of such words might be far from thedecimal system.
It is well known that there often are rival systems,above all the 20-system (vigesimal), the 12-system (cf.
dussin, gross)and the 5-system (quinary).
Many ways of grouping items may seemnatural.There are no position words associated with the positions of binaryrepresentations, but considering the popularity of the binary systemin the computer age one might suggest some, e.g.
duo (or pair) for po-sition 2 (counting from the right), quartet for position 3 (23) and octetfor position 3 (28).
Using these position words (group names) the number11 (eleven), which is 1011 in binary form would be: (one) octet oneduo one.
We might alternatively construct new position words for thepositions of binary numbers.
One way would be to use the decimalwords rio, hundra etc., changing them, by substituting b for the firstletter, into bi(o), bunclra, busen, billion, billiard (').
In this system 12(twelve), which is 1100 in binary form, would be: busenbundra.
Sincebinary representation tends to get very long, an enormous numberof position words would be needed.
We refrain from developing fur-ther binary numerals.The choice of fusion form is apparently depending on the use of thenumber.
The number 121457 is a telephone number.
Such numbersare often divided into 2-groups, but 3-groups or separate pronunciationof each figure also occurs.
It is a well-known fact that such high tele-phone numbers are difficult to get through correctly.
In practice oneintroduces pauses at strategic points to facilitate communication.We will not discuss the communicative and mnemonic advantagesof different systems here.
Let us just mention that there are at leastsome cases, where the totally fused numerals give shorter expressions,e.g.
en million compared to ett-noll-noll-noll-noll-noll-noll.
The lastexample with all the zeros (noll) is probably difficult to get throughover the telephone, since one might easily lose count.
Position wordshave the advantage of indicating how far to the left we are.
They arein a way the equivalents of the zeros used as position fillers in mathemat-ical representations (zeros do not vary according to position).
_As isobvious from the table above there are cases where partial or no fusiongives shorter expressions than expressions based on total fusion.
It isoften said that since there are infinitely many numbers and each numberhas a name (word, numeral) in the language, there are infinitely many28434 ~rNGX $IGURDwords in the language.
If numbers can be infinitely long, words canbe infinitely long too.Decimal fractions are rarely rendered by words, if written: three-point-fourteen looks strange, and so does the Swedish equivalent withkomma instead of point: tre-komma-fjorton.
The figures after the decimalpoint (komma) are generally given separately, in particular, if there isa long row of decimal figures.
For instance, if the value of pi is to begiven by more than 2 decimals one turns to separate pronunciation ofthe figures immediately: compare 3,14 and 3,14159.
For practical pur-poses it seems the rule that figures after the decimal point (komma)are pronounced without fusion is sufficient, and we will not discuss thematter further.The year 1718 is pronounced sjuttonhundraarton not ettusensjuhun-draarton (just as in English).
We will say that total fusion is applied, butnot maximum fusion, since the maximum position word (tusen) of-fered by the language is not used.
In Swedish the normal way of pro--nouncing 1066 would be (ett)tusen-sextiosex, buttiohundrasextiosex mightbe heard (equivalent to the English ten sixty-six except for the lack ofposition word in English).
Non-maximum fusion is only allowed in(1000)1100-1900.
The year 2000 is pronounced r tvd tusen (not tjugohundra).
The year 2384 is naturally renderd as tvdtusentrehundradttiofyra.The reason for not allowing non-maximum fusion above 19 has to dowith a concept of "primary " numerals.
The primary numerals inSwedish (as in many other languages) include (words for) 1-9, the basenumber 10, 11-19 (the -teens, in Swedish: -tontalen: the first two areirregular in Swedish as in all the other Germanic languages; furtherdetails below).The pronunciation of dates is paralleled by the pronunciation ofprices.
A price, e.g.
1900 may be rendered as nitton-hundra (nineteenhundred) or ettusen iohundra (one thousand and nine hundred).
The price2300 (Kronor) may only be pronounced as tv8 tusen tre hundra (nottjugotrehundra).
There is, however, an interesting alternative way ofpronouncing prices.
2300 could be given as tvd-och-tre, 1900 could begiven as ett-och-nio.
A (used) car could thus have the price 1300, whichmay be rendered as trettonhundra, ett(t)usentrehundra or ett-och-tre.
Thecontexts (or hidden units) are important.
The expression tvd-och-trecould perhaps mean the same as tvd millioner trehundratusen (2300000)kronor, (tvd-komma-tre millioner), but not 230 kronor, nor 23 kronor.It might mean tvd kronor och tre i~re (2,03 kronor).
But ambiguities ofthis sort are rare in practice.
In order to avoid ambiguity one mightFROM NUMBERS TO NUMERALS AND VICE VERSA 435pronounce the zero in such cases: tvd-octl-nolt-tre (with stress on nol O.Fortunately most prices of the type under discussion are unambiguous,e.g.
tvd-och-tio (2,10), sexton-och-sjuttiofem (16,75).Numbers play an extremely important r61e in modern society.
Asthe set of numbers often is restricted ue to context, function etc.
re-duced ways of expression, or sublanguages, develop.
A certain row offigures or numerals may be completely unambiguous among used cardealers, although it is ambiguous from the point of view of the totallanguage, or means something different in another sublanguage.
De-tailed studies of the use of figures and numerals in different functions,contests and surroundings would certainly be rewarding.3.
FROM MATHEMATICAL INTO SWEDISH REPRESENTATION.GENERAL CONSIDERATIONSSeparate pronunciation of each figure is no great problem, and wewill concentrate on total fusion in the following.
We begin by presen-.ting the following table where position numbers and position wordsassociated with positions are to be found.
The term position word,of course, reflects our looking at the numerals from the point of viewof the decimal positional representations.
The words could also be calledgroup names or number measures.
For reasons of space we have notincluded any position word higher than milliard.example: 666Position number 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6a6261position value 10g 10 s 10 v 106 105 104 108 102 101 100= 1 6.103 +6.101+ 6.10 oposition word mill- mill- tu- hun- tio/ sexhundrasex-lard ion sen dra -ton tiosexThere is no position word for unit in Swedish.
One might usestycken (pieces, units), but presumably since position word for unitsis redundant i  is generally left out.
As a name for the whole set Swedesuse ental, but it is not possible to use en in the numerals, perhaps becauseen lacks plural.
There is no point in stating that en is there in the under-lying form but obligatorily deleted.
(The numeral en could then bederived by deleting the numeral en before the position word en, whichis an optional rule in many cases: (ett)tusen, (ett)hundra.
But this seemsunnatural sophistication.
)436 BENGT SIGURDThe steps between the higher position words are 108 (1000).
Wewill see examples of languages with different steps later, such as Urdu.The only genuine position words are the first three.
They are also Ger-manic, but they have not always been associated with the decimal sys-tem as is done now.
Many Swedes would hesitate, when it comes toposition words higher than million.
Some might also have a feelingthat languages use milliard, billion etc.
differendy (which is also the case).The number 666 is represented in three different ways above.
Letus call the normal decimal representation: positional decimal, or justdecimal as usual.
The representation 6.10 ~ + 6.101 + 6.100 may becalled: analytic decimal, or just analytic representation, since it analyzesthe number into the terms to be added.
The terms do not have to bein a certain order or take certain positions.
The representation sexhun-drasextiosex is called (fused) linguistic representation as before.Our purpose is to derive linguistic representations from decimalones but the relations between the analytic (decimal) representationand the linguistic one are also of interest.
We will compare generativegrammars for the different ypes of representations briefly.Decimal representations, the input or output of our conversion rul-es, may be generated by the following simple generative rules, whereN is the number, d is digit.
The number of digits in the strings (n) maybe infinite.
(1) N-  d (d) (d)...d ~1,  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0If numbers uch as 000 and 007 are not to be permitted, we have tostate that the first d must be # 0.The analytic decimal representations may be generated by the fol-lowing rules, where (a) and (b) are variants with different order.
(2) N~d---~l d.10 q- d.101 -I- d.10L,.d.10 '~ (a)d.10"... + d.10~ + d.101 + d.10?
(b)1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,8 ,9 ,0The b-variant can easily be derived from the decimal representa-tion by inserting powers of 10 according to position umber.
We mightperhaps consider the b-variant as a semantic interpretation f the deci-mal representation.
Rules converting decimal representations i to ana-lytic ones would then seem related to the interpretative rules suggestedFROM NUMBERS TO NUMERAES AND VICE VERSA 437in transformational grammar.
The analytic representations would bethe readings or the meaning of the decimal expressions.The " generative semantics" approach would then be to start fromthe analytic expressions and derive the normal decimal expressions.This can be done by deleting the powers of 10 from the b-variant,where the order then carries the information about the powers.
Thea-variant gives the units first and has to be reversed by a transformationin order to fit the standard ecimal representation.
Changing the de-cimal representation bymentioning units first would have some advan-tages in communication - presently the listener does not know anythingabout positions if numbers are given by pronouncing each digit sepa-rately as observed by C.-CH.
ErERT (1970).
Note, however, that theunits are given first (in the left-most place) in many languages in theteens (tontalen), and in some languages eveal in higher numbers, e.g.German: ein-und-zwanzig.It is, of course, easy to generalize the rules (2) to cover systems withany base and any arrangement of the terms.Rules for Swedish numerals have been suggested in C.-CH.
ELERT(1970).
They are, however, too surface oriented for our purposes.
Weneed "deep structure" rules for the numerals which are as close aspossible to the decimal representations.
Letus first suggest the follow-ing rules, covering numbers as great as millions.N-+ (d million) (d kundratusen) (d tiotusen) (d tusen) (d hundra)(d tio) (d)d --~ en, tvd, tre, fyra, fern, sex, sju, dtta, nioThe coverage of the first rule can be increased by adding bracketswith the proper content or by introducing recursion (e.g.
N insteadof d before millioner) substitution rules, such as tusen millioner ~ milliard,tusen milliarcler-+ billion (etc.).
In order to derive surface structuresfrom such deep representations we need the following main types ofrules.1) Morphophonemic rules, which change sju tio into sjuttio, fyrainto fjor before ton (fjorton) etc.2) Reordering rules which change the order between units andtens in the teens (tontalen).
Our deep structure would generate n tiofyra for 14, which has to be changed into fjorton with the units beforeton, the representative of rio.
(the en is deleted according to 3.
)438 BEN'GT SIGURD3) Deletion rules, which obligatorily delete en before tto andoptionally delete ett before hundra and tusen.
We have used the com-pound position words: tiotusen, hundratusen, for positions 5, 6.
Since thetusen only occurs in those compounds if there is no other tusen to theright in the string we must delete tusen in other cases.4) Concord rules, which give the plural millioner etc.
at properplaces and the neuter form ett before neuter nouns such as hundra andbarn "child ".It is possible to improve the deep structure rules suggested in variousways.
Arguments could also be found in the pronunciation and ortho-graphic rendering of the numerals.
The following rules are establishedwith such arguments in view.
(3b)N~ (G million) (G tusen) (G)G-~ (d hundra) (d rio) (d)d ~ en, tvd, tre, fyra, fern, sex, sju, dtta, nioIn this approach hundreds, tens and units are treated as a group(constituent) which may occur alone, before tusen, million(er), mil-liard(er) etc.
The difference between rules (3a) and (3b) is perhaps bestshown by the tree diagrams for an example, such as sex millioner sexhundra sex rio sex tusen sex hundra sex tio sex (Fig.
1).The following arguments support analysis according to 3b (cf.
alsoC.-CH.
EI.~RT, 1970).1) Position words are spaced by 103 in Swedish (not necessarilyin all languages) and for positions in between the fundamental groupposition words (hun&a, tio) are used.2) It corresponds to the division into 3-groups often made indecimal representations (666 666 666).
M Swedish space is used; in Eng-lish comma is available for the task, since point is used in decimalfractions.3) Although the phonetic details are by no means clear, it seemsthe proper rules can be formulated easily within this framework.
Themain rule seems to be the following: The last (rightmost) d (simplenumber) within the group ((3) is always given the main stress.
Theothers in the group are reduced accordingly.
The G could perhaps bestbe treated as an attributive (Adjective Determiner) within an NP.
TheN within the NP is tusen, millioner, etc.
(As observed above a head forthe last group is lacking.)
In high numbers everal NP's are coordinat-FROM NUMBERS TO NUMERALS AND VICE VERSA 439(3a)Nd million d hundra d tio d tusen d hundra d tio d(tusen) (t.sen)sex millioner sex kundra sex tio sex tusen sex kundra sex tio sex(3b)Nd million d hundra d tlo d tusen d hundra d tio dsex millioner sex hundra sex rio sex tusen sex hundra sex tio sexFig.

The constituents within G may also be considered as coordinatedNP's .
Some languages how the conjunction (and) between certainNP's.
The phonetic properties of numerals will be treated in greaterdetail in a study by Dr SrRPA-LErr.~o (to appear).4) The orthographic conventions for numerals are by no meansclear.
The parts rio/ton are treated (phonologically) as suffixes andalways joined with the preceding number.
The units are similarly joinedwith a preceding term rio (sextiosex), perhaps also with preceding hundra(sexhundrasex).
As for higher terms it is hard to know: cases are difficultto come by.
(Sexmillionersex or sex millioner sex?)
The simple numeral440 BENGT SIGURDbefore hundra (the coefficient) may or may not be joined with hundra(sex hundra or sexhundra).
The tens may or may not be joined with thepreceding position word: sexhundra sextio or sexhundrasextio.
In brief,the situation is unclear and detailed studies of usage are needed.
Hand-books are conspicuously silent.Many persons probably join all numerals and write them as one longword as a radical solution in this situation.
If conventions are to beintroduced, they could easily be formulated within the tree structuresuggested by (3b).
A simple rule would be the following:join all wordswithin the group G, but no other elements.
This rule would introducespaces where there are deep branchings in the tree.
We would get thefollowing division for our example: sex miUioner sexhundrasextiosextusen sexhundrasextiosex.
But it is possible to formulate other conven-tions if desired.
Some languages use the hyphen (--) between certainconstituents, aswe will see.The relations between analytic representations and the deep struc-tures described by rules 3a and 3b are fairly simple.
Conversion rulesoperating on analytic representations would have to replace the powersof 10 by proper position words, replace the digits by proper simplenumerals etc.
Taking the non-analytic decimal representation as inputto conversion rules, implies inserting the proper position words, butexcept for that there is litde difference, We will now focus our intereston automatic onversion schemes.4.
CONVERSION RULES CHANGING MATHEMATICAL INTO SWEDISHREPRESENTATIONSWe are now ready to test conversion rules written as generativerules or instructions of different kinds.
We will discuss alternative solu-tions at some points.
We distinguish between two blocks of rules:I) fusion rules, which insert position words and introduce syntacticstructure;II) lexical rules, which substitute words (simple numerals) for fi-gures (digits).Ia) Fusion rules.Count number of digits in decimal representation a d mark positions.The (maximum) number of positions (digits) is determined by the positionof the left-most digit which is not zero (~ (3).FROM NUMBERS TO NUMERALS AND VICE VERSA 441If10- digits7-9 digits5-6 digits4 digits3 digits2 digitsthen insertmilliarder after pos.10, milliard if 1 inpos.

Instead of recursive application of therules, compound position words such as tiotusen, hundratusen could beinserted (under certain conditions).As an alternative we might use the following procedure, whichhas some advantages when rules of pronunciation and rules for sepa-rating and combining numerals are to be formulated.
It is based ondeep structure rules 3b (above) which assumes the division of high num-bers into 3-groups (in Swedish often marked by space already).Ib) Fusion rules.Count number of digits and divide into 3-groups starting from right.Count number of 3-groups.

9 -~ \[ + ton nio0 -+ O (deletion)(1 + tio 8 -->)8 + ton --> artonApply the rules in order, repeatedly if necessary, until all digits havebeen processed.As observed before, the elements tio/ton are always joined with thepreceding number and treated as suffixes (-ton numbers take the graveaccent).
This phenomenon is related to the lengthening of t in rio/ton(sjutton, sjuttio, nitton etc.).
We have treated this as allomorphic hoice(not by phonological rules) assuming allomorphs of tre, sju, nio endingin t. In a traditional generative grammar (meeting demands of eco-nomy and simplicity) the doubling of t should be handled by the samerule (dental gemination) that gives bott from bo + t (participle of bo)and bldtt from bld + t (neuter of bld).
We have introduced + rio and+ ton in our rules with the plus to be used (as internal juncture) forspecial purposes.
There might be better ways of handling the situation;it is depending on how pronunciation and orthographic conventionsare to be handled.
We have some use of the plus sign, but have to de-lete it in some cases.
In the rule that deletes en (ett) before rio (to avoidthe impossible tt-tio) we also delete the plus sign.
This gives the result-ant tio the right status, and it is not treated as a suffix in e.g.
hundratio.Notice that the o in tio can only be deleted (optionally) in the suffixtio (femti(o), sjutti(o)), not in cases uch as hundratio where tio is stressed.The fusion rules do what human beings do when they face a stringof digits.

Division into groups ofthree digits is a practical method, which facilitates determination ofthe size of the number (see B. SICURD, 1972).444 BENGT SIGURD5, FROM SWEDISH INTO MATHEMATICAL REPRESENTATIONLet us now outline a system which is the reverse of the previousconversion system.

OUTLINES OF CONVERSION RULES FOR SOME LANGUAGES6.1.
English.Decimal representations could be considered as an interlingua inan automatic translation system between several anguages.
Transla-tion between two related languages, uch as Swedish and English (orall the Germanic languages) could be handled without using decimalrepresentations, since word-for-word translation (and a few additionalrules) would suffice.
This will be obvious from the following exami-nation, but we will not discuss uch conversion rules for pairs of natu-ral languages.I) Fusion rules for English could operate just like in Swedish.Within 3-groups we assume that hundred is inserted after position 3,+ ty after pos.

In Swedish the ele-ments tio (alone), ti(o) in e.g.femtio and ton in e.g.femton are assumed tobe manifestations of the same position (word).
Intuitively most Swedescertainly associate the first two (tio and -ti(o)).
In English the manifes-tations ten and -teen seem the closest.English has a hyphen between units and preceding tens (twenty-five; twenty-one thousand).
This may be handled by inserting a hyphenbefore units (the last position) in 3-groups, if tens are preceding.
Simi-larly and must be inserted before tens or units preceded by htmdreds,thousands etc.
(250630: two hundred and fifty thousand six hundred andthirty).Notice that one/a before hundred, thousand and higher words mustnot be deleted in English.
We refrain from giving any rules for thechoice between one and a.English is known to have special habits in telephone numbers, e.g.the use ofo (ou) for zero and double x as in:five ou double one for 5011.Such idiosyncrasies must be taken into account when constructingautomatic recognition systems.6.2.

There is little allomorphic variation.
We notethe exceptions for 11, 12.
We take zwan as an allomorph ofzwei, justas we took twen as an allomorph of two in English.
One might go fur-ther and consider zw8 in German, twe in English to in Swedish as allo-448 BENGT SIGURDmorphs in zwb'If, twelve, tolv respectively.
If so e/f, eleven, elva may beanalyzed to contain a variant of the word for 1 and something like-l(e)v-, This is etymologically correct (the last root being related toSwedish lgimna, English leave).
But both intuitively and technicallythis seems unnecessary.The conjunction und is obligatory in German between units andtens (the units preceding the tens), optional between hundreds and low-er terms.
The unit word ein may optionally be deleted before hundertand tausend.
It is easy to imagine the rules for German and we refrainfrom giving further details.6.3.

A connective tis used, but only before un after the numerals for: 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70.French has a morpheme ante for tens, but certain features must be asso-ciated with a vigesimal system.
In the numbers for 11-16 one mightdistinguish a morpheme ze, which is in fact etymologically related todix (E. Bouacmz, 1950, p. 68).
French has thus three completely dif-ferent manifestations of the position element for ten: ante, ze, dix, dis-tributed somewhat irregularly.We give an outline of the conversion rules for French.i)Insert + ante, cent, mille...FROM NUMBERS TO NUMERALS AND VICE VERSA 449ii)Substitute:1 + ante 1..6 -+ 1..6 + ze1 +ante~dix7 + ante (1...9) --+ 6 + ante-1 + ante (1...9)8 +ante~4- -2  +ante9 + ante (1...9) -+ 4-2 + ante (1...9)J.

Since French only shows some frag-ments of a different system this is hardly necessary for French.
Thefirst block of rules within the lexical block can take care of irregulari-ties.
These rules apply to more than one item.6.4.

Units precede tens.

Such rules should include thefollowing facts.
For 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 (y) the number of multiples of20 (x) is determined, using the simple equation (4) y = x.20.The resulting value of x is rendered by the usual numerals (with ~some minor morphophonemic changes), unless it is a fraction, suchas 2.5, 3.5, 4.5.
A fraction such as 2.5 is not rendered by to (og en)halv,but by halvtre.
If z is the value before halv we can apply the followingrule(5) z halv ~ halv (z + 1)This rule is also used e.g.
in telling the time in Swedish.
Instead of tvdoch en halv Swedes ay halv tre, when it is half past two.
What the ruledoes is to change an additive representation into a subtractive.FROM NUMBERS TO NUMERALS AND VICE VERSA 451The multiplication sign is rendered by sinds in the Danish numeralsand special reduction rules apply to give the short forms.
Fortunatelynew numerals (more like the Swedish) are catching on in Denmark.6.5.

Aspirated voiceless topor fricative changes into unaspirated voiced stop or fricative.
This ruleexplains the variation between hse : ze for tens, and between hku :gu forunits.Burmese numerals are well adapted to the decimal system.
Restric-ted knowledge in Burmese makes us hesitate but Burmese numeralsseem very simple.
They look almost as if they were constructed at thewriting-table.
The morphological nalysis of the words is evident, thereare no exceptions, uch as our elva and tolv.
The morphemes for 1and 2 have morphophonemic variation (special forms for compound-ing), but except for that there is little morphophonemic variation.The correspondences aredirect, and conversion rules should be simpleto write.
We will only make some further comments.Burmese seems to have (unanalysable, non-compound) positionwords for high numbers, uch as: 10000, 100 000, 1 000 000, 10 000 000(unless we are mistaken).
Burmese also seems to have a word for unit:hku.
In Burmese the unit before 10 in the expression for 10 may option-452 BBNGT $1GURDally be deleted.
We have noted the obligatory deletion of 1 before 10in several languages and the optional deletion of 1 before 100, 1000 insome languages.
Burmese uses hse for + ty as well as + teen (and ten).This has the effect that some words, such as the words for 18 and 80are minimal pairs: hse.hyi(18): hyi hse(80), at least from a segmentalpoint of view.
We do not have such minimal pairs in Swedish because10 is represented by ton after the units in the teens, and by ti(o) beforethe units in the other cases.
We note that traditional morphemic ana-lysis cannot reasonably treat on and ti(o) as allomorphs in Swedish, sincethey contrast as infemtio :femton (cf.
C.-CI~.

The morpheme for 10 (goma)may optionally appear in the teens.
If it is deleted, it seems ha wouldhave to take its place and be considered as a variant (manifestation) of10.
We cannot identify any simple numerals in the words for 20, 30etc.
We might take in as a representative of 10, but the rest has to betreated as a suppletive allomorph of 2, 3, 4 etc.
We note that the mul-tiplier (cocfi%icnt) is placed after its position word in numbers uch as2000, 100 000.
(Do attributives follow their heads in Hausa?)
Notethat, as a consequence, the only difference between the words for100000 and 1100 is the word da.

We note the existence of position wordsfor high numbers paced 102 , not 103 as in Swedish and English.7.
CONCLUSION?
After this brief survey of numerical systems, we can state that con-version between different representations does not cause great problems.We have mainly worked on written forms and disregarded the pho-nological problems.
Solving the problems in connection with conver-sion between spoken numerals and decimal representations is veryimportant One might even accept ad hoc solutions, e.g.
using prere-corded position words and primary numerals, which are combinedaccording to the rules indicated above - a synthesis based on "prefab "elements.454 BENGT SIGURDWe might sum up the problems we have faced when writing con-version rules as follows:1) The fit to decimal representation is rarely as good as in Bur-mese.
Deviations concern the use of other base numbers (5, 20, 12)and different order.
Special adaption rules may be used in such cases.2) The order between multiplier (coefficient) and position wordsvaries (as does the order between attributive and head in noun phrases).In Hausa 5 000 is (the equivalent of) thousand five, while European lan-guages have (the equivalent of)five thousand.
The order between units,tens, hundreds, thousands, millions etc.
only varies between units andtens.
Many languages have the units first in the teens, some have theunits first in all the tens.3) Languages rarely have exactly the same element in the wordfor 10, the teens and the " ties ".
The variation is clearly useful and mayhave a functional explanation, as well as a historical.
In Swedish thewords for 15 (femton) and 50 (femtio) would have coincided, if 10 wasmanifested in the same way in both numbers.
The complication onlyoccurs if units are preposed as in Swedish.4) There are clear tendencies to delete redundant material in thesublanguage that numerals constitute.
The words for 1 and unit areoften deleted, but conventions vary between languages.5) Beside position words and fundamental numerals ome lan-guages use additive (or subtractive) morphemes and morphemes mean-ing multiplication (" times ").
But most languages rely heavily onorder arrangements, which are very economic.6) Sporadic occurrences of fractions have been attested, e.g.
inDanish.
Such cases need special treatment.
If they are isolated, lexicalrules may take care of the matter without any insightful (and etymolo-gically suggestive) rules, at least for practical purposes.7) The conventions for joining numerical morphemes vary verymuch between languages and so does the use of hyphen.
The rules canprobably always be explained on the basis of (assumed) constituentstructure.8) The pronunciation of numerals above all long numerals canpresumably be predicted on the basis of segmental structure and treestructure.
We have not investigated this area in any detail, however.REFERENCEST.
