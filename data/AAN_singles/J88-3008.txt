ESTABLISHING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISCOURSE MODELSAND USER MODELSEthel SchusterDepartment of Computer and Information ScienceThe Moore SchoonUniversity of PennsylvaniaPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania 191041 INTRODUCTIONMany current research efforts have focused on buildingcooperative systems that interact with the{r users in anatural anguage such as English.
To be effective, thesesystems must be robust, their dialog must be coherent,and their responses must be helpful to the user.
A usermodel  (UM), which can be modified during the interac-tion to represent updated beliefs about the current user,is one mechanism that can contribute to a robust,coherent, and cooperative dialog.In general, when we as speakers describe certainsituations, we try to communicate these situations toour listeners.
As proposed by some researchers(Webber 1978, Kamp 1984), speakers do so by attempt-ing to get their listeners to construct an appropriatemodel: a discourse model .
A discourse model (DM) isviewed as containing representations of entities, alongwith their properties and relations they participate in.The key, then, in successful communication is for thespeaker to transmit as much information about thoseentities, their properties and relations to the listener soas to achieve the goals of the current interaction.
Fromthe point of view of a system, a computational discoursemodel is used by the system to generate and/or interpreta discourse.This paper focuses on the relationship between DMsand UMs.
It starts by describing what a DM is, and therole it plays in a coherent di~dog.
It then describes whata UM is, and the role it plays in a cooperative dialog.
Iargue that the DM should be viewed as one part of theUM--that  is, as one part of the system's model of theuser.
The examples of the natural anguage interactionsare presented in the context of a natural languageinterface to an expert system that provides advice oncooking with chilies.
(Part of the data was taken fromthe section "Cooking with Chilies" that appeared inBon Appet i t  magazine, December 1986.
The expertsystem can provide information about the differentvarieties of chili peppers as well as descriptions of howto "turn down the heat" of the chilies (make them lessspicy), and how to cook with them without getting anykind of skin or eye irritations.)
I justify this by showinghow DMs can be viewed as part of UMs and how bothmodels can affect each other.
In other words, part of theUMs that systems have correspond to the DM, that is,a representation of what is talked about in a specificinteraction.
This piece, which changes with each dis-course, affects the UM and varies from interaction tointeraction.2 DESCRIPTION OF DISCOURSE MODELSA piece of discourse is a collection of utterances that arespoken by one or more speakers.
Usually the sentencesin a discourse are connected in a way that makes themcomprehensible and coherent.
One way in which sen-tences in a piece of discourse are connected is via theuse of anaphoric expressions.
In general, anaphoricexpressions refer to things that have been mentionedpreviously in clauses.
(Note that there may be cases inwhich the anaphoric expression may refer to an entitythat will be mentioned afterwards (i.e., cataphora)rather than before it, as in the following:i.
After he finished the race, John went drinking tocelebrate his victory.In this paper, I am concerned only with anaphoricexpressions that refer to entities previously mentioned,such as:ii.
After John finished the race, he went drinking tocelebrate his victory).In English, anaphoric pronouns contribute to coherencein the discourse by avoiding repetitions of entitiesalready mentioned.
Consider the following:1.
John went to the store and bought a pepper.
Hethen went home to cook with it,Copyright 1988 by the Association for Computational Linguistics.

This we do by attempting toget our listeners to construct an appropriate model: adiscourse model.
A speaker's DM enables him to gen-erate what he believes will be coherent utterances.Similarly, the listener's DM enables him to comprehenddiscourse in an organized manner.
Several researchers(Webber 1978, Kamp 1984, Heim 1982, Sag andHankamer 1984) have been concerned with how DMscan be used to identify the referent of an anaphoricexpression.
(Not all these authors use the term "dis-course model".
For instance, Kamp (1981) describesthe utterances as being represented in a discourserepresentation structure (DRS).
The entities mentionedin the sentence are represented in the DRS and they arecalled discourse referents (DRs).
Heim's (1982) frame-work is the File Change Semantics.)
They have sug-gested that speaker and listener each build a model ofthe discourse from the incoming sentences, includingrepresentations of the entities introduced by the dis-course, their properties, and the relations they partici-pate in.
When an entity is later referred to via ananaphoric expression, the discourse participants canuse their DM to make the appropriate link to an entityand hence interpret that anaphoric expression correctly.Some of the work on anaphora has concentrated indescribing what characterizes the entities in the DM.For instance, Webber (1978) looked at the problem ofdefinite noun phrases (where the references are toindividuals and sets) and Schuster (1986, 1988) is look-ing at references to events and actions.
The descriptionof how things, sets, events, actions, facts, and so on,are represented in a discourse model and how one canrefer to them gives us a clue to what characterizes adiscourse model.
Because the representations in thediscourse model are of specific objects or events whichare talked about during the interaction, the discoursemodel can be viewed as a temporary knowledge base.Since a discourse has relatively short duration, thediscourse model that supports the interaction containsshort term or temporary information.It is important o note that the representations ofentities, as they appear in the discourse have a structureas proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986).
While Groszand Sidner do not specifically deal with discoursemodels, their view on discourse is applicable to dis-course models.
The discourse model reflects the struc-ture of the dialog.
In the same way that items arehighlighted in the actual discourse, they appear as beingmore salient in the discourse model.
Because someitems are more salient han others, the representation isnot just a flat representation, but has a hierarchicalstructure in which the more salient entities are repre-sented in the same way as they appear in the discourse.The structure is needed because the ordering of therepresentations does not necessarily correspond to theorder in which the entities are mentioned in the dis-course.
A focusing mechanism plays a very importantrole in understanding discourse.
This mechanism isneeded to process sentences at any point in the dis-course by indicating which objects, things, events, orfacts are more salient at any point in the discourse.When processing a part of discourse, only those entitiesthat are salient come into play.3 A VIEW OF USER MODELSIn this paper, the UM is viewed as "the system's beliefsabout its users".
Many views have been proposed todescribe what UMs are.
The various UMs proposed sofar fall under the general category described here.
Forexample, this definition of UMs includes McCoy's(1985) concept of a UM: the system's beliefs about howthe user views objects in the domain.
It also includesParis's definition of a UM: the system's beliefs aboutthe user's levels of expertise as well as the definition ofUMs as viewed by researchers concerned with planrecognition: the system's beliefs about what the user istrying to do.Many distinctions have been made when character-izing user models.
Kobsa (1985) and Kass and Finin(this issue) distinguish between user models and agentmodels.
(Kobsa actually uses the term Akteurmodell(actor model) since, according to him, the primarymeaning of the German Agent is "secret (foreign)agent".)
For them, the agent model is the model of theperson that the system can model and there can bemany agent models.
The user model is the model of thespecific agent hat interacts with the system.
Often theagent model and the user model coincide.
In this paper,I will assume that this is the case.
Also, Rich (1979)distinguishes between models of individual users andmodels for classes of users, as well as between long-term as compared to short-term UMs.
This notion ofshort- and long-term UMs provides a spectrum of partsof the UM, some of which are temporary and some ofwhich remain after the discourse nds.
I will show moreon this issue in the next section.In this paper, I assume that the system has represen-tations for three possible stereotypes of users: a begin-ner, an intermediate, and an expert.
The system canmodify its own user model as the interaction occurs, asa result of the information that flows out from thediscourse model into the user model.
Thus the usermodel is dynamic.
In general, information that is rele-vant to the user and which is represented in the DMbecomes part of the UM.Consider a simulated expert system HOT, whichprovides information about cooking with chilies.
Thesystem provides advice to aficionados (amateurs) aboutbuying, cutting, peeling, storing, and cooking withchilies.
The system also has a general UM from which itcan identify three possible users: beginner, intermedi-ate, and expert.
These are canonical UMs, and they areComputational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 3, September 1988 83Ethe l  Schuster Establishing 'the Relationship Between Discourse Models and User Modelsrepresentations of three potential classes of users of thesystem.
The beginner stereotype contains informationabout simple and well-known varieties of chili peppers.It also contains information about storing chilies.
Thestereotype for intermediate users assumes that the userknows more than a beginner, while an expert is assumedto know about unusual varieties of peppers and to beinterested in more sophisticated information concerningchili peppers and detailed information about using dif-ferent kinds of them.The users interact with the system by asking ques-tions.
From these, HOT can decide how to fit each userinto any of the particular UMs that it has available.Also, the sample responses from HOT are used as a wayof demonstrating how the UM participates in the dis-course.
In other words, the responses show evidence ofinteraction between the UM and the DM.
The followingexample illustrates the interaction between HOT andone of its users.2.
U: Hi!
I love to eat spicy food and I love to cookwith chilies.
I just found some fresh peppers in thehealth food store called banana-peppers and I wastold they are very hot.
How can I peel them?From this introduction the system can deduce that theuser is an intermediate user in cooking with chilies, andinvokes the stereotype for intermediate users.
Howdoes the system decide that this user is an intermediateand not a beginner?
Firstly, the user explicitly mentionsthat he likes to eat and cook spicy food.
Also, thesystem can realize that a more experienced person inspicy food knows about the need to peel hot chilies(sometimes), while a novice may not realize that somekinds of peppers need to be peeled.
And an expertwould know how to peel hot peppers.
These factstrigger the intermediate stereotype in the user modelingsystem.
Notice that the user mentions pecific entities(e.g., himself, peppers, health food stores, and so on) aswell as events: "user loves to eat spicy food", "usercooks", and so on.
All these entities and event descrip-tions are represented in the DM and they are used toinfer the correct level of the user in the UM.
This fact isevidence that the DM is part of the UM.
Once thesystem has decided that the user is an intermediate, itcan respond not only in terms of what the user wants toknow, but also what will be most helpful to the user.4 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DM AND UMIn the previous sections I have shown the role of theDM in a user-system interaction.
I have also describedthe role that a UM plays in a user-system interaction.The system uses the information in the UM to decidewhat kind of user it is interacting with, as well as how torespond to the particular user.Given the definition of UMs in the previous ection,the DM seems to clearly be part of the UM, that is, it isthe system's beliefs about what the user believes aboutthe discourse.
The question then is whether the DM isthe system's beliefs about the discourse or is it thesystem's beliefs about the user's beliefs about thediscourse.
I would argue that it is the latter.
It has beenclaimed lhat both dialog participants must be focused onthe same subset of knowledge for communication to besuccessfal.
If the system has a DM that allows it tocomprehend utterances one way and the user has a DMthat causes it to interpret an utterance differently, theinteraction is going to fail.
So if the system is going touse its DM to generate utterances that it believes theuser can understand as the system intended, then itmust believe that its DM reflects the user's beliefs aboutwhat has been talked about.
(One might argue that wehave to go all the way to mutual beliefs--namely, thatthe DM is the system's beliefs about what is mutuallybelieved about the discourse.
)Furthermore, if the DM were separate from the UM,then an entity introduced by the discourse could alwaysbe referred to.
But that may not be possible unless thesystem believes the user knows about this particularentity.
On the other hand, if the DM is part of the UM,then only those entities that the system believes the userknows about can be represented implicitly in the DM,since in this case the DM must represent the system'sbeliefs about the user's beliefs about the discourse.Then the system can only coherently refer to entitiesthat it believes the user knows about, since these are theonly ones represented in its DM.In the previous ection, I described a view of UMswith three stereotypes.
Pictorially, this can be seen as akernel of information with several possible levels:I Expert\[ .

.The INITIAL-UM is the representation f the UM thatthe system has initially (before any interaction).
Duringits interaction with the user, the system builds the DM.In turn, information taken from this DM is used toupdate the INITIAL-UM into an UPDATED-UM.
TheUPDATED-UM becomes a FINAL-UM when the in-teraction ends (possibly after several updates).
Notethat only parts of the FINAL-UM persists for future useafter the current interaction ends.All the information that the user provides is repre-sented in the DM.
Consider the following:3.
U: I want to know how to peel banana-peppers.Imagine, my mother was in Mexico and I askedher to buy some for me.
She decided to try one ofthem and she burnt her throat.
She had to berushed to the hospital, blah, blah, blah.84 Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 3, September 1988Ethel Schuster Establishing the Relationship Between Discourse Models and User ModelsThis information is also part of the UM.
Given thedefinition of the UM as the system's beliefs about theuser, then this information provided by the user is thesystem's beliefs about the user's beliefs about what hasoccurred.
For  instance, now the system believes thatthe user believes that you can buy banana-peppers inMexico.In replying to its users, the system not only decideswhat information to include in the reply, but can alsouse anaphoric expressions (i.e.
pronouns) in its re-sponses.
The only way the system could have usedthose pronouns was by having a representation of thediscourse in which the mentioned entities were repre-sented and available for reference.
Also, since thesystem responded in terms of its model of the users,only if the DM is part of the UM, can the system take itinto account in its responses and its reasoning about theusers.
Both the UM and the DM were needed increating the response, not only because of the specificinformation used in the response, but also in the way inwhich that information was actually presented to theusers.
In other words, the DM is part of what the systemneeds to consult when responding to its users.One of the ways to identify how the UM contains theDM is by looking for what information might be in theUM but not in the DM.
In the earlier examples, theresponses generated by HOT made use of informationtaken from the stereotype invoked for the individualuser.
This information was not present in (or implied by)the previous discourse.
Hence the UM contains infor-mation that does not appear in the DM.Note also that the DM can affect the rest of the UM.Suppose a user comes often in contact with the system,and keeps referring to the same things.
After severalinteractions, these things the user mentions shouldeventually become part of the long-term UM.
Thequestion that is left is whether it is indeed worthwhile toperform this transfer from the DM into the long-termUM.
For instance, if a user talks about the same thingsover a course of several interactions and the informa-tion is moved to the UM, what happens if the user stopstalking about those specific things?
Do we then deletethe information from the UM and allow for new infor-mation to come in?
Also, with respect o the short- andlong-term UMs, we could consider the short-term partsto be the DM, which is removed once it is no longerrelevant.
The intermediate parts could correspond tothe beliefs that the system has about what the user istrying to do.
And the long term would be the beliefsabout the user's level of expertise, his likes, or dislikes.These are among the many issues that remain to besolved.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSMany thanks go to Kathy McCoy, Sandy Carberry, Bob Kass, JuliaHirschberg, Alfred Kobsa, and Tim Finin for their discussions thathelped me in understanding this controversial issue as well as for theircomments on earlier drafts of this paper.
