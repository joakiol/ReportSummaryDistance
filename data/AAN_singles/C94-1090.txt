As showl l  ahoy(3, a5:;IQLF may contain any numt)er of recta-variables and sotile scm,'mtics of the language isslighlly different from thetraditional one.
Instead of a function from models to truthvalues, a partial function is delined.The denotation of a formula F is a partial function \[\[F\]\]from models to truth values.
This partial fimction is de-fined by W, a relation between a formula, a model axtd ;ttruth value.
Tile quality of a monotonic semantics i ap-parent in the case whcn \[\[F\]\] with rcspcct o seine modelis undefined, i.e.
W(F, m, 1) and W(F, m, 0).
This situ-ation occurs when recta-variables are present in the QLFand consequentially apartial interpretation is being con-sidcrcd.
The incremcat~d analysis provides an 'extension'of \[\[F\]\] in \[\[F'\]\] whenever F' is a more resolved version ofF.The semantic rules that diseha,ge recta-variables arc ofthe general fonn: W(F, m, v) if W(U, m, v) where F' isan 'extension' of F.2.3 The  Re la t ion  CATA relation CAT ef category is de!incd wiLh the followingarguments.~, category?

thecomputational nalogue ors  was implemented asa col-lection of 'resolution rules' in \[AIs90\].
'ltm work reportedin this paper and in \[IIur93\] is a computational nalogueef C.A'T wilh a more general and declarative treaunent.2.4 Def in ing  CATGiven that certain arguments of tile CAT relation aremembers of infinite sets (context, restriction) and that oth-ers are dependent on these ,arguments (referent), all ele-ments of CA7 c,'m never be explicitly enumerated.
Tiledescription of this relation should, then, take the argu-ments that are finite (category quantifier) and use somecompact definition to accommodate the inliuite arguments.A definition of C.AT bltsed on theorem proving fulfills thisrole, as described in the following sections.
The declar-alive delinilion allows the direction of resolution to beindicated be the reels-variables that require'insk'mtiatiou.3 LOGIC OF RESOLUTIONBefore continuing with a more formal definition ,'m ex,.un-pie of resolntion is presented.
The phrase The girl runshas the following abstract form.Resolving this means insUmtiating the meta-variables_q and _r, and a possible resolution might be to ex i  s t sand a 1. i c e respectively.We can see how the category limits the selection of thequantilier and the selection of the referent with respect othe restriction, that is - we r(xluim a single definite objectin context for which the restriction holds.
This suggestsa dclinitiou of CAT as a series of rules defining how theuninslautiated arguments ac  formed and how values Callbe found with respect to the context, for exampleCAT(C, I, R, < Ent, ex is ts  >, Ctxt)single~objcct_matching_rcstriction(Ent, R, Ctxt)Conscquently, infizrence can be used to, in this exmnple,find some value of Ent wlfich holds for R in Ctxt.3.1 Contextual Entailment of ResolutionThe preeess of resolution in the QLF formalism is simplythe inslantialion of recta variables with respect to the rela?tion CAT.
As described previously, this relation involvesthe context of processing ,'rod ~m be expressed logicallyin the follewing mammt;Ctxl; U /~ssumption ~: \[Res F ?> F'\]where, for forwmd resolution (-->), F' is a mere insmn-tinted vcrsien ef F, mid for backwm'd resolution (?=) F isau unresolved QLF  of tile p~tially instantiatcd F'.The addition of a set of Assumptions iS included lot"complclcness, though in tlfis work is in fact ,an empty552set.
Assumptions c,'m be used, lot example, to promotea possible rcferent o be most salient when there are twoequally likely possibilitics.In bricf, resolution of Ihc term The girl to some Iokena l i ce  in file example wotdd have Ihe c, ltailme,,tCtxt(C)run( term( idx l ,  < .

The axioms associatedwilh each layer ,are ,also mentioned.An intuitive mployment of this technique applied toterms as a method of resolution might include the follow-ing compotleffls, given tint we ,'u'e dealing with a QLFand some conjunctive normal form datable.1.
Couvert QLF to logicad form.2.
Satisfy tile logical form wifll a theorem prover.Ilowever, wifll tile use of suitable ,axioms we ~'m col-lapse these into one step.
In order to do this, the QLFformalism must be accepted as valid fonnulae ill the l,'m-guage of the Iheorem prover.
The advant,qge oftiffs methodallows a single style of operation to be employed in thesatisfaction of QLFs.In order for this method of resolution to work cor-rectly bi-directionally, it is required that we allow theIheorem prover to rm~ge over arguments and predicatesin tile database.
This :dlows file algorithm to function illthe reverse direction.
This being file case, logical terms(al'ler processing) ,are asserted in the database in a listformat, i.e.
\ [p red icate ,  a rg , ,  a rg2 .
.
.
.
\ ] in -stead o fDred icate  (a rg  l, a rg2  .
.
.
.
).
Also, QLF'templates' (see \[I hu93\] for a full expl~mation) are used toprovide a desirable set of generatable noun phrase struc-tures in the backw~,rd irection.4.1 "l~vo LayersThere arc two layers ill the theorem prover.
The reasonfor this is as follows.
Ultimately, we want to co,mern our-selves with proofs like p(token).
In order to do this wchave to transform Ihc origimd QLF into a series of,'tssoci-ated predicates.
The argunmnts othese predicates may beQI,Fs themselves which require discharge of a quantifiedterm to produce a logical cxprcssiou.
The process of dis-charge can not be accomplished with a simple declarativerule local to the prcdieate as a number of representationsexist in the CI,1 / QLF formalism that require discharged toa token  in a procedur,-d m,'mner.
Therefore, it is neces-sary to lirst perform anmnber of transformations, togetherwith a procedural implementation f term discharge, ,as alirst stage to using tile theorcn~ prover in resolution.,5534.2 Top Proofqhe first layer of the theorem prover is concerned withQLFs and the QLF axioms.
The axioms m~e used toeffectively translbnn the QLF into a lirst order notationfrom which point simple in lettuce can be carried out withrespect o the lacls asserted in the dat~fl~ase.
This level ofproof is straight lbrwmd m~d involves three cases.
Modesponens, and intro and the special case, discharge of terms.Case 1 is the use of a QLF axiom.
The second case issimply the proof o f a conj uuct by the proof of its parts.
*i'heliuifl case is the discharge of terms.
The discharge of termsreduces a te rm exprcssioa into a token  about whichinference cm~ be tanled out with the assertions in thedolnain.
An algorithm exists to carry out this proceduralattachment totile proof \[1 hu93\].4.3 QLF AxiomsAn important colnpollellt of {his level of the proof mecha-nism is the set of axioms used to l'Cl)rcscnt he rchttionshipbetween the restriction and the logical latlgua?,e of Ihcdalabase.The following is an exampleof an axiom used by thetop level of the theorem prover and is rule that encodesthe reduction of the restriction of a possessive fom~.~o~(_, po~, n, do~, : \ [~d,  \[pl, A\], Iv, A, "l\],~pv(X'v\[po~, x, Y\], Inaox))\[po~.~, A, ~\] a \[pl, A\]which represents he following fl reduction.l, A::(P~(A) A F(A, g) \ [aX~r(po~4X , r ) ) \ ]:.
(P~(A) A ~x~y (po~4X,  ~'))(A, n))3.
(PI(A) Aposs(A,B))which has the same logical form.4.4 GeneralTheorein ProverThe second layer of the proof procedure takes as inptt\[a (possibly pmtially instanliated) logical expression andan entity and returns, conditionally on success, the fullyinstantiatcd logical expression.There are three different cases which the proof mecha- ,nistn deals with.
These are as follows.
.,1.
A clause is present in the conlcxt model which unifieswith the expression to be shown.2.
An inference rtfle can be employed to prove the expres-sion, in which case each of the autcccdcnt proofs mustbe constructed.3.
A proof of equality caa be constructed, in which casesul)slitution ismade between the entities in the equalityproof and this equal cntily is used in Ihc proof.4.5 Domain AxiomsThe second layer of tim theorem prover 'also has a set ofxdoms with which to generak; proofs.
These axioms areeither iLssertcd in the datab,'tse as pint of fl~e interactionbetween the user and the system, or may be explicitlyplaced there prior to use?5 PARAPHRASINGThe object of paraphrasing is to produce a concise m~d,if possible, m~mlbiguous description of a previous tate.~mcnt.
As this work is only concernexl with generationof objcct descriptions, we wm~t to use the technique de-scribed for reversible resolution mid produce a string thatdescribes the entity according to a set of evaluation crite-ria.
This set of criteria can then be evaluated in file contextof a preference metric used to select he best descriptionloGeaeration is carried out by the CLE.
~I\]le meth-.ods employed to generate from a QLF are discussed in\[SvNPMg0\].5 .1  Const ra in ts  on  Descr ip t ionThere are a ntunber of consmfint that should be considerexlwhen producing a noml phrase to describe an object.
Asuitable subset is:1.
Effort of Realisafion (ER): a mc,'mure of the effortrequired to realise the actual words in the medium used.2.
Effort of Association (EA): a mc~sure of the effortrequired to associate some entity with lira descriptionrealised.3.
Informational Value (G): a me,~sure of the complexityof the realisation.4.
Domain Coverage (DG): a measure of the numberof items in the domain that ~m be described by therealisalion.5.
t:ATccts of Salience: how such things ,as recency effectthe other dimensions.5.2 Preference by DimensionThe following is a simple interpretation f tile at)eve con-strainls as a l ira attempt at obtaining a metric for nomlphrase preferences.l~mh dimension is preferred ~ 1.
Minimise, 2.
Min-imise, 3.
Maximise (with respect to salience), 4.
Miu-imise (unique lement of domain preferred); ,and a simpleimplementation f the dimensions might be (functions of)1.
ER: the physical lengfll of the orthographic representation.2.
EA: the size of the proof (or a weighted sum of the proof).a l)esigning a metric for any stage of Natural Language lh'ocessingwill always have a certain ad hoc nature.
IIowever, intuitive principalscan often gukle through the vagaries.
