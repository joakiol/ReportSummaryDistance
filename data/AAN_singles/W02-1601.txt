In order to describe the correspondencebetween different languages, we propose a variant of SSTC called synchronous SSTC (S-SSTC).
We will alsodescribe how S-SSTC provides the flexibility to treat some of the non-standard cases, which are problematic toother synchronous formalisms.
The proposed S-SSTC schema is well suited to describe the correspondencebetween different languages, in particular, relating a language with its translation in another language (i.e.
inMachine Translation).
Also it can be used as annotation for translation systems that automatically extract transfermappings (rules or examples) from bilingual corpora.
The S-SSTC is very well suited for the construction of aBilingual Knowledge Bank (BKB), where the examples are kept in form of S-SSTCs.KEYWORDS:parallel text, Structured String-Tree Correspondence (SSTC), Synchronous SSTC, BilingualKnowledge Bank (BKB), Tree Bank Annotation Schema.1.
INTRODUCTIONThere is now a consensus about the fact that naturallanguage should be described as correspondencesbetween different levels of representation.
Much oftheoretical linguistics can be formulated in a verynatural manner as stating correspondences(translations) between layers of representationstructures (Rambow & Satta, 1996).In this paper, a flexible annotation schema calledStructured String-Tree Correspondence (SSTC)(Boitet & Zaharin, 1988) will be introduced tocapture a natural languagetext, its correspondingabstract linguistic representation and the mapping(correspondence) between these two.
Thecorrespondence between the string and its associatedrepresentation tree structure is defined in terms of thesub-correspondence between parts of the string(substrings) and parts of the tree structure (subtrees),which can be interpreted for both analysis andgeneration.
Such correspondence is defined in a waythat is able to handle some non-standard cases (e.g.non-projective correspondence).While synchronous systems are becoming more andmore popular, there is therefore a great need forformal models of corresponding different levels ofrepresentation structures.
Existing synchronoussystems face a problem of handling, in acomputationally attractive way, some non-standardphenomena exist between NLs.
Therefore there is aneed for a flexible annotation schema to realizeadditional power and flexibility in expressing thedesired structural correspondences between languages(representation structures).Many problems in Machine Translation (MT), inparticular transfer-rules extraction, EBMT, etc., canbe expressed via correspondences.
We will define avariant of SSTC called synchronous SSTC (S-SSTC).S-SSTC consists of two SSTCs that are related by asynchronization relation.
The use of S-SSTC ismotivated by the desire to describe not only thecorrespondence between the text and itsrepresentation structure for each language (i.e.
SSTC)but also the correspondence between two languages(synchronous correspondence).
For instance, betweena language and its translation in other language in thecase of MT.
The S-SSTC will be used to relateexpression of a natural language to its associatedtranslation in another language.
The interfacebetween the two languages is made precise via asynchronization relation between two SSTCs, whichis totally non-directional.In this paper, we will present the proposed S-SSTC ?a schema well suited to describe the correspondencebetween two languages.
The synchronous SSTC isflexible and able to handle the non-standardcorrespondence cases exist between differentlanguages.
It can also be used to facilitate automaticextraction of transfer mappings (rules or examples)from bilingual corpora.2.
STRUCTURED STRING-TREECORRESPONDENCE (SSTC)From the Meaning-Text Theory (MTT)1 point ofview, Natural Language (NL) is considered as acorrespondence between meanings and texts (Kahane,2001).
The MTT point of view, even if it has beenintroduced in different formulations, is more or lessaccepted by the whole linguistic community.In this section, we stress on the fact that in order todescribe Natural Language (NL) in a natural manner,three distinct components need to be expressed by thelinguistic formalisms; namely, the text, itscorresponding abstract linguistic representation andthe mapping (correspondence) between these two.Actually, NL is not only a correspondence betweendifferent representation levels, as stressed by MTTpostulates, but also a sub-correspondence betweenthem.
For instance, between the string in a languageand its representation tree structure, it is important tospecify the sub-correspondences between parts of thestring (substrings) and parts of the tree structure(subtrees), which can be interpreted for both analysisand generation in NLP.
It is well known that manylinguistic constructions are not projective (e.g.scrambling, cross serial dependencies, etc.).
Hence, itis very much desired to define the correspondence ina way to be able to handle the non-standard cases(e.g.
non-projective correspondence), see Figure 1.Towards this aim, a flexible annotation structurecalled Structured String-Tree Correspondence (SSTC)was introduced in Boitet & Zaharin (1988) to recordthe string of terms, its associated representationstructure and the mapping between the two, which isexpressed by the sub-correspondences recorded aspart of a SSTC.1The Meaning-7H[W 7KHRU\ 077 ZDV SXW IRUZDUG LQ ?RONRYVNL0HO?

These featuresare very much desired in the design of an annotationscheme, in particular for the treatment of linguisticphenomena, which are non-standard, e.g.
crosseddependencies (Tang & Zaharin, 1995).Definitions2:- An SSTC is a general structure, which is a string in alanguage associated with an arbitrary tree structure;i.e.
its interpretation structure, and the correspondencebetween the string and its associated tree, which can benon-projective; i.e.
SSTC is a triple (st, tr, co), where stis a string in one language, tr is its associatedrepresentation tree structure and co is thecorrespondence between st and tr.- The correspondence co between a string and itsrepresentation tree is made of two interrelatedcorrespondences:a) Between nodes and substrings (possiblydiscontinuous).b) Between (possibly incomplete) subtrees and(possibly discontinuous) substrings.- The correspondence can be encoded on the tree byattaching to each node N in the representation tree twosequences of INTERVALS called SNODE(N) andSTREE(N).- SNODE(N): An interval of the substring in the stringthat corresponds to the node N in the tree.STREE(N): An interval of the substring in the stringthat corresponds to the subtree having the node N asroot.Figure 2 illustrates the sentence ?John picks the boxup?
with its corresponding SSTC.
It contains a non-projective correspondence.
An interval is assigned toeach word in the sentence, i.e.
(0-1) for ?John?, (1-2)for ?picks?, (2-3) for ?the", (3-4) for ?box?
and (4-5)for ?up?.
A substring in the sentence that correspondsto a node in the representation tree is denoted byassigning the interval of the substring to SNODE of2These definitions are based on the discussion in (Tang, 1994) andBoitet & Zaharin (1988).Figure 1:  The correspondence between the string ?he picks thebox up?

the subtree rooted at node ?picks up?with STREE interval (0-5) corresponds to the wholesentence ?John picks the box up?.The case depicted in Figure 2, describes how theSSTC structure treats some non-standard linguisticphenomena.
The particle "up" is featurised into theverb "pick" and in discontinuous manner (e.g.
"up"(4-5)in "pick-up" (1-2+4-5)) in the sentence "Hepicks the box up".

SYNCHRONOUS SSTC STRUCTUREMuch of theoretical linguistics can be formulated in avery natural manner as stating correspondences(translations) between layers of representationstructures (Rambow & Satta, 1996), such as therelation between syntax and semantic.
An analogousproblem is to be defined in such a way that expressesthe correspondence between a language and itstranslations in other languages.
Therefore thesynchronization of two adequate linguisticformalisms seems to be an appropriate representationfor that.The idea of parallelized formalisms is widely usedone, and one which has been applied in manydifferent ways.
The use of synchronous formalisms ismotivated by the desire to describe two languages thatare closely related to each other but that do not havethe same structures.
For example, synchronous TreeAdjoining Grammar (S-TAG) can be used to relateTAGs for two different languages, for example, forthe purpose of immediate structural translation inmachine translation (Abeill?
et al,1990), (Harbusch& Poller,1996), or for relating a syntactic TAG andsemantic one for the same language (Shieber &Schabes,1990).
S-TAG is a variant of Tree AdjoiningGrammar (TAG) introduced by (Shieber &Schabes,1990) to characterize correspondencesbetween tree adjoining languages.
Considering theoriginal definition of S-TAGs, one can see that it doesnot restrict the structures that can be produced in thesource and target languages.
It allows the constructionof a non-TAL (Shieber, 1994), (Harbusch & Poller,2000).
As a result, Shieber (1994) propose a restricteddefinition for S-TAG, namely, the IS-TAG forisomorphic S-TAG.
In this case only TAL can beformed in each component.
This isomorphismrequirement is formally attractive, but for practicalapplications somewhat too strict.
Also contrastivewell-known translation phenomena exist in differentlanguages, which cannot be expressed by IS-TAG,Figure 3 illustrates some examples (Shieber, 1994).Similar limitations also appear in synchronous CFGs(Harbusch & Poller,1994).Due to these limitations, instead of investigating intothe synchronization of two grammars, we propose aflexible annotation schema (i.e.
SynchronousStructured String-Tree Correspondence (S-SSTC)) torealize additional power and flexibility in expressingstructural correspondences at the level of languagesentence pairs.
For example, such schema can serveas a mean to represent translation examples, or findstructural correspondences for the purpose of transfergrammar learning (Menezes & Richardson, 2001),(Aramaki et al, 2001), (Watanabe et al, 2000),(Meyers et al, 2000), (Matsumoto et al, 1993), (kajiet al, 1992), and example-base machine translationEBMT3 (Sato & Nagao, 1990), (Sato, 1991),(Richardson et al, 2001), (Al-Adhaileh & Tang,1999).3.1 The Synchronous SSTCIn this section, we will discuss the definition and theformal properties of S-SSTC.
A S-SSTC consists of apair of SSTCs with an additional synchronizationrelation between them.
The use of S-SSTC ismotivated by the desire to describe not only thecorrespondence between the text and itsrepresentation structure in one language (i.e.
SSTC)but also the correspondence between two languages(synchronous correspondence).Definitions:- Let each of S and T be SSTC which consists of atriple (st, tr, co), where st is a string in onelanguage, tr is its associated representation treestructure and co is the correspondence between stand tr, as defined in Section 2.1.- A synchronous SSTC Ssyn is defined as a triple (S, T,( , )?

Inthese cases the synchronous correspondence is straitforward (following the above definitions); e.g.
see Figure 4and Figure 6.The S-SSTC will be used to relate expressions of anatural language to its associated translation inanother language.
For convenience, we will call thetwo languages source and target languages, althoughS-SSTC is non-directional.
S-SSTC is defined tomake such relation explicit.
Figure 4 depicts a S-SSTC for the English source sentence ?John picksthe heavy box up?
and its translation in the Malaytarget sentence ?John kutip kotak berat itu?.
Thegray arrows indicate the correspondence between thestring and it representation tree within each of theSSTCs, and the dot-gray arrows indicate the relations(i.e.
synchronous correspondence) of synchronizationbetween linguistic units of the source SSTC and thetarget SSTC.Based on the notation used in S-SSTC, Figure 4illustrates the S-SSTC for the English sentence ?Johnpicks the heavy box up?
and its translation in theMalay language ?John kutip kotak berat itu?, withthe synchronous correspondence between them.
Thesynchronous correspondence is denoted in terms ofSNODE pairs forsnAand STREE pairs forstA .
ForsnA each pair is of (ssnA,tsnA ), wheressnA is SNODEinterval/s from the source SSTC andtsnAis SNODEinterval/s from the target SSTC.
As forstAeach pair isof (sstA,tstA ), wheresstAis STREE interval/s from thesource SSTC andtstAis STREE interval/s from thetarget SSTC.
For instance, as depicted in Figure 5,the fact that ?picks up?
in the source corresponds to?kutip?
in the target is expressed by the pair(ssnA,tsnA )?
(1-2+5-6,1-2) under thesnAsynchronouscorrespondence.
Whereas, the fact that ?John picksthe heavy box up?
is corresponds to ?John kutippicks[v] up[p](1-2+5-6/0-6)John[n](0-1/0-1)box[n](4-5/2-5)0John1picks2the3heavy4box5up6TreeStringkutip[v]( 1-2 /0-5)John[n](0-1/0-1)kotak[n](2-3/ 2-5)0John1kutip2kotak3berat4itu5TreeStringheavy[adj](3-4/3-4)the[det](2-3/2-3)berat[adj](3-4/3-4)itu[det](4-5/4-5)(1-2+5-6,1-2) Synchronouscorrespondencesnst(0-1,0-1) (4-5,2-3)(2-3,4-5) (3-4,3-4)(0-6,0-5) (0-1,0-1)(2-5,2-5) (2-3,4-5)(3-4,3-4)Figure 4: A synchronous SSTC for the sentence ?John picks theheavy box up?

HANDLING NON-STANDARD CASESWITH S-SSTCAs mentioned earlier, there are some non-standardphenomena exist between different languages, thatcause challenges for synchronized formalisms.
In thisSection, we will describe some example cases, whichare drawn from the problem of using synchronousformalisms to define translations between languages(e.g.
Shieber (1994) cases).
Due to lack of space wewill only brief on some of these non-standard caseswithout going into the details.Figure 4 illustrates a case where the English sentencehas non-standard cases of featurisation, crosseddependency and a many-to-one synchronouscorrespondence in ?picks up?.
Another case isreordering of words in the phrases, which is clear inthe phrase ?thedet heavyadj boxn?
and it correspondingphrase ?kotakn beratadj itudet?
in the target.Figure 5, shows two non-standard cases betweenlanguages; e.g.
French and English.
First, the case ofmany-to-one correspondence, where a word (singlenode) in one language corresponds to a phrase(subtree) in the other, namely, the adverbial?hopefully?
is translated into the French phrase ?Onesp?re que?.
Second, a case of argument swap(reordering of subtrees) in the English ?Kim missesDale?
and its corresponding translation ?Dalemanqu?
a Kim?
in French.Figure 6 describes the cases of clitic climbing inFrench and the non-projective correspondence (i.e.crossed dependency).
It shows the flexibility of SSTCand the proposed S-SSTC in handling such popularcases.Figure 7 exemplifies a case where the number ofnodes in the synchronized SSTCs or subSSTCs is thesame, but they exhibit different structures.
Nodesparticipating in the domination relationship in oneSSTC may be mapped to nodes neither of whichdominates the other (i.e.
elimination of dominance).Another even more extreme relationship between thesynchronized pair involving inverted correspondencesis exemplified in Figure 8.Figure 5:  Many-to-one correspondence and arguments swapping corres-pondence in the French sentence ?On esp?re que Dale manqu?

TheGerman word ?beschenkte?
corresponds to theEnglish phrase ?give present?
which is a partialsubtree from the tree rooted by the word ?give?
in theEnglish SSTC.
This synchronous correspondence isrecorded under thestA  where the operation (-: minus)is used to calculate the Y:STREE interval/s for thepartial subtree/s.5.
SYNCHRONOUS CORRESPOND-ENCE CONSTRAINTS BETWEENNATURAL LANGUAGES (NLs)As we mentioned in Section 2, in the SSTC thecorrespondences between the surface text and theassociated representation tree structure are ensured bymeans of intervals; i.e.
(X:SNODE, Y:STREE).
Thisexplicitly indicates which word/s of the textcorrespond/s to which node in the tree.
For describinga NL using SSTC, a set of constraints were defined togovern such correspondences (Lepage, 1994):- X:SNODE and Y:STREE intervals are governed by thefollowing constraints:i) Global correspondence: an entire tree corresponds toan entire sentence.ii) Inclusion: a subtree which is part of another subtreeT, must correspond to a substring in the substringcorresponding to T.iii) Membership: a node in a subtree T, must correspondto a word which is member of the substringcorresponding to T.In a similar manner, in order to describe thesynchronous correspondences between NLs using S-SSTC, we define a set of constraints to govern thesynchronous correspondences between the differentNLs.
These constraints will be used to makeexplicitly the synchronous correspondences in anatural manner.-snA andstA are governed by the following constraints:?
Singleness: A node N which has a synchronizationcorrespondence, can participate in one and only one A?snA , and one and only one A  ?stA .
This meansallowing one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many,but the mappings do not overlap.?
Inclusion: Given twostA  correspondence pairs1stA =(1sstA ,1tstA ) and2stA = (2sstA ,2tstA ),1stA  and2stA satisfy theinclusion constraint if and only if1sstA?2sstA and1tstA?2tstA .?
Membership: Given two correspondence pairs (sstA ,tstA )?stA and (ssnA ,tsnA ) ?snA ,snA andstA  satisfy themembership constraints if and only ifssnA?sstA  andtsnA?tstA .
This means the lexical correspondences arealways members in the structural correspondences.?
Dominance: Given two subtrees S and T, there is acorrespondence A  ?stA between S and T satisfy thedominance constraints if and only if ?
 ?
STREE(S)correspond to ?
 ?
STREE(T).?
Globality: Given a S-SSTC, there must be A ?stAsatisfies the globality constraints between the the rootnode Rs of the entire tree in the first SSTC and the rootnode Rt of the entire tree in the second SSTC, if andonly if (sstA ,tstA )?stAsuch thatsstA = STREE(Rs) :INT(String) in the first SSTC, andtstA = STREE(Rt) :INT(String) in the second SSTC.
This mean the wholetree in the first SSTC corresponds to the whole tree inthe second SSTC, and the whole string in the first SSTCcorresponds to the whole string in the second SSTC).Note that these constraints can be used to license onlythe linguistically meaningful synchronous corr-espondences between the two SSTCs of the S-SSTC(i.e.
between the two languages).
For instance, whenbuilding translation units in EBMT approaches(Richardson et al, 2001), (Aramaki, 2001), (Al-Adhaileh &Tang, 1999), (Sato & Nagao, 1990),(Sato, 1991), (Sadler & Vendelmans, 1990), etc.,where S-SSTC can be used to represent the entries ofthe BKB or when S-SSTC used as an annotationschema to find the translation correspondences(lexical and structural correspondences) for transfer-rules?

Note that the grammaralignment rules used in (Menezes & Richardson,2001) can be reformulated using these constraints toconstruct the transfer mappings from a synchronoussource-target example.Figure 10 shows an example from Menezes andRichardson (2001), the logical form for the Spanish-English pair: (?En Informaci?n del hiperv?nculo, hagaclic en la direcci?n del hiperv?nculo?, ?UnderHyperlink Information, click the hyperlink address?
).Recently, the development of machine translationsystems requires a substantial amount of translationknowledge typically embodied in the bilingualcorpora.
For instance, the development of translationsystems based on transfer mappings (rules orexamples) that automatically extracted from thesebilingual corpora.
All these systems typically firstobtain a tree structures (normally a predicate-argument or a dependency structure) for both thesource and target sentences.
From the resultingstructures, lexical and structural correspondencesbetween the two structures are extracted, which arethen presented as a set of examples in a bilingualknowledge bank (BKB) or transfer rules fortranslation process.However, what has so far been lacking is a schema ora framework to annotate and express such extractedlexical and structural correspondences in a flexibleand powerful manner.
The proposed S-SSTCannotation schema can fulfill this need, and it isflexible enough to handle different type of relationsthat may happen between different languages?structures.
S-SSTC very well suited for theconstruction of a BKB, which is needed for theEBMT applications.
Al-Adhaileh and Tang (2001)presented an approach for constructing a BKB basedon the S-SSTC.In S-SSTC, the synchronous correspondence isdefined in a way to ensure a flexible representationfor both lexical and structural correspondences: i-Node?to?node correspondence (lexical correspond-ence), which is recorded in terms of pair of intervals(Xs,Xt) where Xs and Xt is SNODE interval/s for thesource and the target SSTC respectively, ii- Subtree?to?Subtree correspondence (structural correspond-ence), whichis very much needed for relating the twodifferent languages at a level higher than the lexicallevel, a level of phrases.
It is recorded in terms ofpair of intervals (Ys,Yt) where Ys and Yt is STREEinterval/s for the source and the target SSTCrespectively.Furthermore, the SSTC structure can easily beextended to keep multiple levels of linguisticinformation, if they are considered important toenhance the performance of the machine translationsystem (i.e.
Features transfer).
For instance, eachnode representing a word in the annotated treestructure can be tagged with part of speech (POS),semantic features and morphological features.6.
CONCLUSIONThe proposed S-SSTC is not limited for the casediscussed here (i.e.
MT), any system need to describetwo language structures and the synchronizationrelation between them, can used S-SSTC asannotation schema for that.
This is for example thecase for presenting the syntax-semantics interfacebetween different languages.
S-SSTC is a flexibleschema, which is able to handle non-standardphenomena that may occur between differentlanguages.
We conclude this paper with someinteresting observations on the synchronous SSTC:i- A natural way to put the representation trees (i.e.
atext and its translation) in a very fine-grainedcorrespondence.ii- A natural way to specify bi-directional structuraltransfer, as SSTC is used to specify structuralanalyzers and generators (i.e.
bi-directional).iii- Synchronous SSTC can be easily extended torecord the correspondences between more thantwo languages, hopefully with transitive property,especially in constructing multilingual knowledgebanks (MKB) (i.e.
synchronization betweenmultiple languages).iv- Synchronous SSTC inherits from the SSTC theindependence from the choice of the tree structureand linguistic theories.
Also the ability of handlingthe non-standard cases in Natural language andbetween different languages.Figure 10: (a) the lexical correspondences, (b) the structural corres-pondences after applying the constraints.Hacer(4-5/0-11)Informaci?n (en)(0-2/0-2)Hiperv?nculo(de)(2-4/2-4)usted(Dsub)(-- clic (Dobj)(5-6/5-6)Direcci?n(en la)(6-9/6-11)Hiperv?nculo(de)(9-11/9-11)Click(3-4/0-7)Hyperlink-Information(under)(0-3/0-3)you(Dsub)--address(Dobj)(6-7/5-7)Hyperlink(Mod)(5-6/5-6)(a)0En1Informaci?n2del3hiperv?nculo4haga5clic6en7la8direcci?n9del10hiperv?nculo110Under1Hyperlink2Information3click4 the5hyperlink6address7Hacer(4-5/0-11)Informaci?n (en)(0-2/0-2)Hiperv?nculo(de)(2-4/2-4)usted(Dsub)--clic (Dobj)(5-6/5-6)Direcci?n(en la)(6-9/6-11)Hiperv?nculo(de)(9-11/9-11)Click(3-4/0-7)Hyperlink-Information(under)(0-3/0-3)you(Dsub)(--Hyperlink(Mod)(5-6/5-6)(b)0En1Informaci?n2del3hiperv?nculo4haga5clic6en7la8direcci?n9del10hiperv?nculo110Under1Hyperlink2Information3click4 the5hyperlink6address7Synchronouscorrespondence sns t(9-11,5-6) (-, -)(0-11,0-7)(9-11,5-6)(0-4,0-3) (6-9,6-7) (5-6,3-4)(6-11,5-7)(-, -)address(Dobj)(6-7/5-7)v- The transfer between two languages, such assource and target languages in machinetranslation, can be done by putting directly intocorrespondence large elementary units withoutgoing through some interlingual representationand without major changes to the source andtarget formalisms.Also a GUI editor has been implemented for view,edit, create and correct the S-SSTC components, asillustrated in Figure 11.REFERENCESAbeill?, A., Schabes, Y. and Joshi, A.
