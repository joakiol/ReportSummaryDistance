G. Abbas MalikDepartment of LinguisticsDenis Diderot, University of Paris 7Paris, Franceabbas.malik@gmail.comAbstractMachine Transliteration is to transcribe aword written in a script with approximatephonetic equivalence in another lan-guage.
It is useful for machine transla-tion, cross-lingual information retrieval,multilingual text and speech processing.Punjabi Machine Transliteration (PMT)is a special case of machine translitera-tion and is a process of converting a wordfrom Shahmukhi (based on Arabic script)to Gurmukhi (derivation of Landa,Shardha and Takri, old scripts of Indiansubcontinent), two scripts of Punjabi, ir-respective of the type of word.The Punjabi Machine TransliterationSystem uses transliteration rules (charac-ter mappings and dependency rules) fortransliteration of Shahmukhi words intoGurmukhi.
The PMT system can translit-erate every word written in Shahmukhi.1 IntroductionPunjabi is the mother tongue of more than 110million people of Pakistan (66 million), India (44million) and many millions in America, Canadaand Europe.
It has been written in two mutuallyincomprehensible scripts Shahmukhi and Gur-mukhi for centuries.
Punjabis from Pakistan areunable to comprehend Punjabi written in Gur-mukhi and Punjabis from India are unable tocomprehend Punjabi written in Shahmukhi.
Incontrast, they do not have any problem to under-stand the verbal expression of each other.
Pun-jabi Machine Transliteration (PMT) system is aneffort to bridge the written communication gapbetween the two scripts for the benefit of the mil-lions of Punjabis around the globe.Transliteration refers to phonetic translationacross two languages with different writing sys-tems (Knight & Graehl, 1998), such as Arabic toEnglish (Nasreen & Leah, 2003).
Most priorwork has been done for Machine Translation(MT) (Knight & Leah, 97; Paola & Sanjeev,2003; Knight & Stall, 1998) from English toother major languages of the world like Arabic,Chinese, etc.
for cross-lingual information re-trieval (Pirkola et al 2003), for the developmentof multilingual resources (Yan et al 2003; Kang& Kim, 2000) and for the development of cross-lingual applications.PMT is a special kind of machine translitera-tion.
It converts a Shahmukhi word into a Gur-mukhi word irrespective of the type constraintsof the word.
It not only preserves the phoneticsof the transliterated word but in contrast to usualtransliteration, also preserves the meaning.Two scripts are discussed and compared.Based on this comparison and analysis, charactermappings between Shahmukhi and Gurmukhi aredrawn and transliteration rules are discussed.Finally, architecture and process of the PMT sys-tem are discussed.
When it is applied to PunjabiUnicode encoded text especially designed fortesting, the results were complied and analyzed.PMT system will provide basis for Cross-Scriptural Information Retrieval (CSIR) andCross-Scriptural Application Development(CSAD).2 Punjabi Machine TransliterationAccording to Paola (2003), ?When writing a for-eign name in one?s native language, one tries topreserve the way it sounds, i.e.
one uses an or-thographic representation which, when readaloud by the native speaker of the language,sounds as it would when spoken by a speaker ofthe foreign language ?
a process referred to asTransliteration?.
Usually, transliteration is re-ferred to phonetic translation of a word of some1137specific type (proper nouns, technical terms, etc)across languages with different writing systems.Native speakers may not understand the meaningof transliterated word.PMT is a special type of Machine Translitera-tion in which a word is transliterated across twodifferent writing systems used for the same lan-guage.
It is independent of the type constraint ofthe word.
It preserves both the phonetics as wellas the meaning of transliterated word.3 Scripts of Punjabi3.1 ShahmukhiShahmukhi derives its character set form theArabic alphabet.
It is a right-to-left script and theshape assumed by a character in a word is con-text sensitive, i.e.
the shape of a character is dif-ferent depending whether the position of thecharacter is at the beginning, in the middle or atthe end of the word.
Normally, it is written inNastalique, a highly complex writing system thatis cursive and context-sensitive.
A sentence illus-trating Shahmukhi is given below:X}Z ????

?< 6??
~@??

?6=?PIt has 49 consonants, 16 diacritical marks and16 vowels, etc.
(Malik 2005)3.2 GurmukhiGurmukhi derives its character set from oldscripts of the Indian Sub-continent i.e.
Landa(script of North West), Sharda (script of Kash-mir) and Takri (script of western Himalaya).
It isa left-to-right syllabic script.
A sentence illustrat-ing Gurmukhi is given below:??????

? ????
?.It has 38 consonants, 10 vowels characters, 9vowel symbols, 2 symbols for nasal sounds and 1symbol that duplicates the sound of a consonant.
(Bhatia 2003, Malik 2005)4 Analysis and PMT RulesPunjabi is written in two completely differentscripts.
One script is right-to-left and the other isleft-to-right.
One is Arabic based cursive and theother is syllabic.
But both of them represent thephonetic repository of Punjabi.
These phoneticsounds are used to determine the relation be-tween the characters of two scripts.
On the basisof this idea, character mappings are determined.For the analysis and comparison, both scriptsare subdivided into different group on the basisof types of characters e.g.
consonants, vowels,diacritical marks, etc.4.1 Consonant MappingConsonants can be further subdivided into twogroups:Aspirated Consonants: There are sixteen as-pirated consonants in Punjabi (Malik, 2005).
Tenof these aspirated consonants (JJ[b?
], JJ[p?],JJ[??
], JJ[??
], bY[??
], bb[??
], |e[??
], |e[??
], ??[k?],??[g?])
are very frequently used in Punjabi ascompared to the remaining six aspirates (|g[r?],|h[??
], ??[l?
], Jb[m?
], JJ[n?
], |z[v?]).
InShahmukhi, aspirated consonants are representedby the combination of a consonant (to be aspi-rated) and HEH-DOACHASHMEE (|).
Forexample [ [b] + | [h] = JJ [b?]
and ` [?]
+ | [h]= Yb  [??
].In Gurmukhi, each frequently used aspirated-consonant is represented by a unique character.But, less frequent aspirated consonants are repre-sented by the combination of a consonant (to beaspirated) and sub-joined PAIREEN HAAHAAe.g.
?
[l] + ??
+ ?
[h] = ??
(??)
[l?]
and ?
[v] + ?
?+ ?
[h] = ??
)|z(  [v?
], where ??
is the sub-joiner.The sub-joiner character (??)
tells that the follow-ing ?
[h] is going to change the shape ofPAIREEN HAAHHA.The mapping of ten frequently used aspiratedconsonants is given in Table 1.Sr.

?Table 1: Aspirated Consonants MappingThe mapping for the remaining six aspirates iscovered under non-aspirated consonants.Non-Aspirated Consonants: In case of non-aspirated consonants, Shahmukhi has more con-sonants than Gurmukhi, which follows the onesymbol for one sound principle.
On the otherhand there are more then one characters for asingle sound in Shahmukhi.
For example, Seh1138(_), Seen (k) and Sad (m) represent [s] and [s]has one equivalent in Gurmukhi i.e.
Sassaa (?
).Similarly other characters like ?
[a], ?
[?
], ?
[h]and ?
[z] have multiple equivalents in Shah-mukhi.

In Shahmukhi,these vowels are represented with help of fourlong vowels (Alef Madda (W), Alef (Z), Vav (z) andChoti Yeh (~)) and three short vowels (ArabicFatha ?
Zabar ( F?
), Arabic Damma ?
Pesh ( E?
)and Arabic Kasra ?
Zer (G?)).
Note that the lasttwo long vowels are also used as consonants.Hamza (Y) is a special character and alwayscomes between two vowel sounds as a placeholder.
For example, in ?G?6 W [?s???]
(comfort),Hamza (Y) is separating two vowel sounds Alef (Z)and Zer (G?
), in zW [?o] (come), Hamza (Y) isseparating two vowel sounds Alef Madda (W) [?
]and Vav (z) [o], etc.
In the first example ?G?6 W[?s???]
(comfort), Hamza (Y) is separating twovowel sounds Alef (Z) and Zer (G?
), but normallyZer ( G?)
is dropped by common people.
SoHamza (Y) is mapped on ?
[?]
when it is followedby a consonant.In Gurmukhi, vowels are represented by tenindependent vowel characters (?, ?, ?, ?, ?,?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
and nine dependent vowel signs(?
?, ?
?, ?
?, ?
?, ?
?, ?

When a vowelsound comes at the start of a word or is inde-pendent of some consonant in the middle or endof a word, independent vowels are used; other-wise dependent vowel signs are used.
The analy-sis of vowels is shown in Table 4 and the vowelmapping is given in Table 3.Sr.

?Table 6: Diacritical MappingDiacritical marks in Shahmukhi are very im-portant for the correct pronunciation and under-standing the meaning of a word.
But they aresparingly used in writing by common people.
Inthe normal text of Shahmukhi books, newspa-pers, and magazines etc.
one will not find thediacritical marks.
The pronunciation of a wordand its meaning would be comprehended withthe help of the context in which it is used.For example,E} FZ?
uuu ~ww ~h?a }ZX@?
?~  ~h?a }Z wiXIn the first sentence, the word ~h?a is pronouncedas [??
?i] and it conveys the meaning of ?wide?.In the second sentence, the word ~h?a is pro-nounced as [?u?i] and it conveys the meaning of?bangle?.
There should be Zabar ( F?)
after Cheh(a) and Pesh ( E?)
after Cheh (a) in the first andsecond words respectively, to remove the ambi-guities.It is clear from the above example that dia-critical marks are essential for removing ambi-guities, natural language processing and speechsynthesis.4.5 Other SymbolsPunctuation marks in Gurmukhi are the same asin English, except the full stop.
DANDA (?)
anddouble DANDA (?)
of Devanagri script are usedfor the full stop instead.
In case of Shahmukhi,these are same as in Arabic.
The mapping of dig-its and punctuation marks is given in Table 7.Sr.

14 X ?Table 7: Other Symbols Mapping4.6 Dependency RulesCharacter mappings alone are not sufficient forPMT.
They require certain dependency or con-textual rules for producing correct transliteration.The basic idea behind these rules is the same asthat of the character mappings.
These rules in-clude rules for aspirated consonants, non-aspirated consonants, Alef (Z), Alef Madda (W),Vav (z), Choti Yeh (~) etc.
Only some of theserules are discussed here due to space limitations.Rules for Consonants: Shahmukhi conso-nants are transliterated into their equivalent1141Gurmukhi consonants e.g.
k ?
?
[s].
Any dia-critical mark except Shadda ( H?)
is ignored at thispoint and is treated in rules for vowels or in rulesfor diacritical marks.
In Shahmukhi, Shadda (H?
)is placed after the consonant but in Gurmukhi, itsequivalent Addak (??)
is placed before the con-sonant e.g.
\ + H?
?
???
[pp].
Both Shadda (H?
)and Addak (??)
double the sound a consonantafter or before which they are placed.This rule is applicable to all consonants in Ta-ble 1 and 2 except Ain (q), Noon (y),Noonghunna (y), Vav (z), Heh Gol ({),Dochashmee Heh (|), Choti Yeh (~) and BareeYeh (}).
These characters are treated separately.Rule for Hamza (Y): Hamza (Y) is a specialcharacter of Shahmukhi.
Rules for Hamza (Y) are:?
If Hamza (Y) is followed by Choti Yeh (~), thenHamza (Y) and Choti Yeh (~) will betransliterated into ?
[i].?
If Hamza (Y) is followed by Baree Yeh (}),then Hamza (Y) and Baree Yeh (}) will betransliterated into ?
[e].?
If Hamza (Y) is followed by Zer (G?
), thenHamza (Y) and Zer ( G?)
will be transliteratedinto ?
[?].?
If Hamza (Y) is followed by Pesh (E?
), thenHamza (Y) and Pesh (E?)
will be transliteratedinto ?
[?
].In all other cases, Hamza (Y) will be transliter-ated into ?
[?
].5 PMT System5.1 System ArchitectureThe architecture of PMT system and its func-tionality are described in this section.
The systemarchitecture of Punjabi Machine TransliterationSystem is shown in figure 1.Unicode encoded Shahmukhi text input is re-ceived by the Input Text Parser thatparses it into Shahmukhi words by using simpleparsing techniques.
These words are calledShahmukhi Tokens.
Then these tokens are givento the Transliteration Component.
Thiscomponent gives each token to the PMT TokenConverter that converts a Shahmukhi Tokeninto a Gurmukhi Token by using the PMTRules Manager, which consists of charactermappings and dependency rules.
The PMT To-ken Converter then gives the Gurmukhi To-ken back to the Transliteration Compo-nent.
When all Shahmukhi Tokens are con-verted into Gurmukhi Tokens, then all GurmukhiTokens are passed to the Output Text Gen-erator that generates the output Unicode en-coded Gurmukhi text.
The main PMT process isdone by the PMT Token Converter and thePMT Rules Manager.Figure 1: Architecture of PMT SystemPMT system is a rule based transliteration sys-tem and is very robust.
It is fast and accurate inits working.
It can be used in domains involvingInformation Communication Technology (web,WAP, instant messaging, etc.
).5.2 PMT ProcessThe PMT Process is implemented in the PMTToken Converter and the PMT RulesManager.
For PMT, each Shahmukhi Token isparsed into its constituent characters and thecharacter dependencies are determined on thebasis of the occurrence and the contextualplacement of the character in the token.
In eachShahmukhi Token, there are some characters thatbear dependencies and some characters are inde-pendent of such contextual dependencies fortransliteration.
If the character under considera-tion bears a dependency, then it is resolved andtransliterated with the help of dependency rules.Input Text ParserPMT Rules ManagerCharacterMappingsDepend-ency RulesUnicode EncodedShahmukhi TextUnicode EncodedGurmukhi TextPMT Token ConverterShahmukhi TokenGurmukhi TokenPunjabi Machine TransliterationSystemOutput TextGeneratorTransliterationComponentShahmukhi TokensGurmukhi Tokens1142If the character under consideration does not beara dependency, then its transliteration is achievedby character mapping.
This is done through map-ping a character of the Shahmukhi token to itsequivalent Gurmukhi character with the help ofcharacter mapping tables 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7, which-ever is applicable.
In this way, a Shahmukhi To-ken is transliterated into its equivalent GurmukhiToken.Consider some input Shahmukhi text S. First itis parsed into Shahmukhi Tokens (S1, S2?
SN).Suppose that Si= ?y63?Zz?
[v?lej??]
is the ithShah-mukhi Token.
Siis parsed into characters Vav (z)[v], Alef (Z) [?
], Lam (w) [l], Choti Yeh (~) [j],Alef (Z) [?]
and Noon Ghunna (y) [?].
Then PMTmappings and dependency rules are applied totransliterate the Shahmukhi Token into a Gur-mukhi Token.
The Gurmukhi TokenGi=????????
is generated from Si.

Gn).From these Gurmukhi Tokens, Gurmukhi text Gis generated.The important point to be noted here is thatinput Shahmukhi text must contain all necessarydiacritical marks, which are necessary for thecorrect pronunciation and understanding themeaning of the transliterated word.6 Evaluation Experiments6.1 Input SelectionThe first task for evaluation of the PMT systemis the selection of input texts.
To consider thehistorical aspects, two manuscripts, poetry byMaqbal (Maqbal) and Heer by Waris Shah(Waris, 1766) were selected.
GeographicallyPunjab is divided into four parts eastern Punjab(Indian Punjab), central Punjab, southern Punjaband northern Punjab.
All these geographical re-gions represent the major dialects of Punjabi.Hayms of Baba Nanak (eastern Punjab), Heer byWaris Shah (central Punjab), Hayms by KhawajaFarid (southern Punjab) and Saif-ul-Malooq byMian Muhammad Bakhsh (northern Punjab)were selected for the evaluation of PMT system.All the above selected texts are categorized asclassical literature of Punjabi.
In modern litera-ture, poetry and short stories of different poetsand writers were selected from some issues ofPuncham (monthly Punjabi magazine since1985) and other published books.
All of theseselected texts were then compiled into Unicodeencoded text as none of them were available inthis form before.The main task after the compilation of all theselected texts into Unicode encoded texts is toput all necessary diacritical marks in the text.This is done with help of dictionaries.
The accu-racy of the PMT system depends upon the neces-sary diacritical marks.
Absence of the necessarydiacritical marks affects the accuracy greatly.6.2 ResultsAfter the compilation of selected input texts, theyare transliterated into Gurmukhi texts by usingthe PMT system.
Then the transliterated Gur-mukhi texts are tested for errors and accuracy.Testing is done manually with help of dictionar-ies of Shahmukhi and Gurmukhi by persons whoknow both scripts.
The results are given in Table9.Source Total Words AccuracyManuscripts 1,007 98.21Baba Nanak 3,918 98.47Khawaja Farid 2,289 98.25Waris Shah 14,225 98.95Mian Muhammad Bakhsh 7,245 98.52Modern lieratutre 16,736 99.39Total 45,420 98.95Table 9: Results of PMT SystemIf we look at the results, it is clear that thePMT system gives more than 98% accuracy onclassical literature and more than 99% accuracyon the modern literature.
So PMT system fulfillsthe requirement of transliteration across twoscripts of Punjabi.
The only constraint to achievethis accuracy is that input text must contain allnecessary diacritical marks for removing ambi-guities.11437 ConclusionShahmukhi and Gurmukhi being the only twoprevailing scripts for Punjabi expressions en-compass a population of almost 110 millionaround the globe.
PMT is an endeavor to bridgethe ethnical, cultural and geographical divisionsbetween the Punjabi speaking communities.
Byimplementing this system of transliteration, newhorizons for thought, idea and belief will beshared and the world will gain an impetus on theefforts harmonizing relationships between na-tions.
The large repository of historical, literaryand religious work done by generations will nowbe available for easy transformation and critiquefor all.
The research has future milestone ena-bling PMT system for back machine translitera-tion from Gurmukhi to Shahmukhi.ReferenceAri Pirkola, Jarmo Toivonen, Heikki Keskustalo, KariVisala, and Kalervo J?rvelin.
