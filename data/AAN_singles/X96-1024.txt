The Temple Translator's Workstation ProjectMichelle VanniU.S.
Department of Defensemtvanni@ afterlife.ncsc.milThe Temple project has developed anopen multi.lingual rchitecture andsoftware support for rapiddevelopment of extensible MachineTranslation functionalities.
Thetargeted languages are those forwhich Natural Language Processingand human resources are scarce ordifficult to obtain.
The goal is tosupport rapid development ofmachine translation functionalities ina very short time with limitedresources.The Temple Translator'sWorkstation is incorporated into aR6mi ZajacComputing Research LaboratoryNew Mexico State Universityzajac@crl.nmsu.eduTipster document managementarchitecture and it allows bothtranslator/analysts and monolingualanalysts to use the machine-translation function for assessing therelevance of a translated document orotherwise using its information i  theperformance of other types ofinformation processing.
Translatorscan also use its output as a roughdraft from which to begin the processof producing a translation, followingup with specific post-editingfunctions.Figure 1: The Temple tools.OverviewGlossary-Based Machine-Translation (GBMT) wasfirst developed at CMU as part of the Panglossproject \[Nirenburg 95; Cohen et al, 93; Nirenburget al, 93; Frederking et al, 93\], and a sizeableSpanish-English GBMT system was implemented.The Temple project has built upon this experienceand extended the GBMT approach to otherlanguages: Japanese, Arabic, and Russian.
Thisexpetience with other languages has providedsignificant insights for the development of aversatile GBMT engine and for the use of off-the-shelf components for building a complete Machine-Translation System.
Building a generic platform forintegrating various Machine-Translation Systems ina single flexible user environment built upon theTipster document architecture \[COris~an 95\], hasalso been a valuable experience for developinggenetic Natural Language Processing supportsystems.The user interface of the Temple Workstationincludes a collection/document browser, the TipsterEditor for Documents, a genetic translationfunction, access to lexical resources and context-sensitive help (Figure 1).The Temple Translator's Workstation design is~iginal in that it combines the best features andeliminates the weaknesses of competingalternatives.
On the one hand, like word-basedglossers, it puts the user in control by allowing allcore linguistic components used by the glossary-based engine to be accessed, modified anddeveloped by the translator.
On the other hand, likeadvanced MT systems, it uses reliablemorphological processors and taggers, componentswhich are relatively inexpensive, require little or nomaintenance, and greatly enhance output quality.Currently, the Temple prototype provides automaticraw ~n?1ish translations from documents in severallanguages (Spanish, Arabic, Japanese and Russian).Translations are produced using a GBMT engine.
* Funded by DOD, Maryland Procurement Office, MDA904-94-R-3075/A0001.101Analysts and translators can edit the raw translationusing a multilingual editor (Figure2).
Sourcedocuments and their translations are managed usingthe Tipster Document Manager developed at CRL,which is also used as the architectural basis forintegrating the system's components.The core components of the glossary-based ngineare the bilingual dictionaries and the bilingualglossaries, which can easily include entries basedon translators' own notes using a mulfilinguallexical database ditor.
It is this very database thatis accessed at run time by the machine-translationsystem.
Thus, when a translator modifies the lexicaldatabase (Figure 5), the modifications areimmediately seen and used by the glossary-basedengine in the machine-translation system.
Bycontrast, in MAHT systems, dictionaries andglossaries are intended for human access only, andin almost all advanced MT systems, dictionaries(but not glossaries) can only be accessed andupdated by a lexicologist with special tralnin~g.

"YiYIYI'fiYIYhYiYiYiFigure 2: An Arabic document and its raw translation.ArchitectureThe Temple prototype includes:?
A GBMT engine that provides an automatictranslation for each language pair.?
Morphological analyzers, bilingualdictionaries, and bilingual glossaries forSpanish, Arabic.
Japanese and Russian, andan English morphological generator\[Penman 88\].?
A multilingual document editor (the TipsterEditor for Documents developed at CRLunder the Norm projecO used to browsedocuments and their translation.?
A multilingual dictionary and glossaryeditor and utilities to parse and load flatdictionary (Machine-ReadableDictionaries) and glossary files into thesystem's lexical database.?
Corpus-based utilities to automatize theacquisition of bilingual glossaries.?
A Tipster Document Manager to supportaccess and processing of user's documents.The Temple architecture is capable of handling alarge number of character codesets through the useof the multilingual text library developed at CRL,which includes a multilingual string library, amultilingual widget library (use fig example todevelop the mulfilingual exical editor) and themultilingual Tipster Editor for Documents.Tipster annotations are used as a lingua franca forrepresenting linguistic information shared amongvarious NIP components, uch as morphologicalanalyzers, taggers, bilingual dictionaries, theGBMT engine and the morphological generator.Each component has access to the common datastructure through aunique interface provided by theTipster Document Manager developed at CRL.NIP components are integrated in the architecture%102through TCL wrappers and filters that interface thecomponent with the Temple representation storedas annotations in the Tipster Document Manager.Since most of the NLP components use linguisticrepresentation that may widely differ, a singleinternal representation is used, e.g., for encodingpart-of-speech, morphological features, etc.
AnNLP component interface to the document managerincludes a mapping from the componentrepresentation to the Temple internal unique ?linguistic representation.One important outcome of the Temple project is thedevelopment of an architecture to support he reuseof NLP tools and resources:Tools that are acquired from an externalsource, such as morphological analyzers,generators, or taggers, can be integrated inthe system with a minimum of programmingeffort.Heterogenecms linguistic resources areparsed and mapped to a commonmultilingual representation.Deep Source Tree Structure  j   Source Phrase"~ Matching , j~Flat Source Tree Structure~,,jkf Creation of Target Phra~s~--~Partial Target Tree StructureMorphological ~"~_.._ Transfer .,J -~Partial Target Tree Structure~Morphologlcal~....~Agreement ~ '~Full Target Tree Structurelqgure .J: Process ot Ulossary-Based Maclnne-'H'anslatlon.Glossary-Based MachineTranslationThe GBMT engine is the core component of theworkstation machine-translation function.
TheGBMT engine is parametrized by a bilingualglossary.
The bilingual glossary is essentially aphrasal dictionary: a glossary entry contains asource phrase pattern, a set of corresponding targetphrase patterns, and correspondences betweenvariables in the source and in the target patterns(Figure 4).A GBMT system produces a phrase-by-phrasetranslation of the source texL falling back on aword-by-word translation when no phrase from theglossary matches the input.
Thus, the size of theglossary and the flexibility of the pattern languageare crucial for the production of bettertranslations.The GBMT engine processes ourcetree structures in four steps:1.
Glossary phrases are matched withinsentence sub-trees (produced by amorphological ~,alyzer and varioustaggers and segmenters, depending on thelanguage);2.
Target phrases patterns are added in thetree for each source phrase match;3.
M~xphological information is transferredfrom source tokens to target okens;4.
Agreement binding information isgenerated for each source phrase.The tree structure manipulated by the GBMTengine contains both the source tree and the targettree which are simply source and target projectionsof the same data structure.
Each target ree's lexicaltoken is then sent to the morphological generatorwhich produces the surface inflected form of eachlexical token.
Finally, the resulting fullyinstantiated tree structure is processed to produce a103target Tipster document which contains altemativetranslations, tagging and morphologicalinformation and constituent information stored asTipster annotations.Figure 4: The lexicai editor with the Spanish dictionary.Reuse of MRDsBilingual dictionaries that are used for the word-for-word fall-back translation are processedversions of various MRDs 1 (e.g.
the Spanish-English Collins Dictionary, Figure 4) or of otherMT dictionaries that have been restructuredaccording to Temple own dictionary structure.partial glossary entries and is then loaded in thelexical database.
The translator can then use theglossary editor (Figure 5) to edit any entry flaggedas incomplete.
Using the glossary editor, thetranslator can also access bilingual dictionaries anduse a variety of corpus-aytalysis tools, including akey word in context (KWIC) utility and aconcordance tool.Semi-automatic development of glossariesThe availability of a large glossary is the key forgood quality translations.
The Temple Translator'sWorkstation provides the MT developer with toolsto semi-antomatically build glossaries.
These toolswork on large tagged corpora and use statistics onco-occurrence of words in a given corpus to extractphrase patterns.The translator uses a phrase extraction utility tobuild a list of recurring patterns of words in acorpus (Ngrams).
This list is formatted as a list of1.
See for examole \[Guthrie t al.
93a, Guthfie et al93b, Stein et al 93\].The glossary is clearly dependent on the kind oftext included in the corpus being used.
butdependency on a particular domain and type of textis a natural limitation of machine-translationsystems, and a GBMT is no exception.
However,building a small size glossary, such as the Arabic-English glossary which contains approximately10,000 entries, is a relatively easy and fast task.
TheArabic-English glossary, for example, was built insix man/months.
Moreover, it is fairly easy toenhance the glossary when new texts are beingprocessed: these new texts can be added to thecorpus and the corpus can be processed again toprovide a new list of potential glossary entries.
The104translator can, of course, manually add any phrase to the glossary.Figure 5: The glossary editor with the Japanese glo~ary.Conclusion ReferencesThe Temple Translator's Workstation has beendeveloped in C within a two-year project at CRL.The project has provided valuable results andinsights for the development of a flexiblemultUingual platform for Natural LanguageProcessing.
Bilingual dictionaries and glossarieshave been developed for Spanish, Arabic, Japanese,and Russian.
The project has produced a workingmultillngual Translator's Workstation prototypewith complete machine translation functions forSpanish, Arabic, and Japanese to English, and sc~neRussian morphological nalysis.
It has also resultedin the development of a language and toolintegration methodology that facilitates the processof developing a new machine-translation systemand integrating it in a translator's workingenvkonment.
The translations produced answer theneed for fast multilingual machine translationcapabilities as required in information processingenvironments because the linguistic omponents ofthe system are derived from the very textsundergoing translation and analysis in the system.\[Cohen et al 93\] Cohen, A., P.
