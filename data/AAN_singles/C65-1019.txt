In  par t i cu la r ,  the  PSG mode l  w i tha pushdown s tore  (PSG/PDS)  a s descr ibed  byVoYngve ,  and the  PSG wi th  subscr ip ts  (PSG/S)as  descr ibed  by  G oHarman are  cons idered .It is contended that such  dev ices ,  even  ifthey  may do away w i th  some of the d i f f i cu l _t ies  of  PSG, do not conta in  su f f i c ient  gene_ra t ive  power  to produce  the s t ruc tura l ly  corn_p l i ca ted  sentences  that are generated  by  o therg ramma rs (e.g., of t rans format iona l  type) .The  hand l ing  of mu l t ip le  d isco ,Lt inuous  con_s t i tuents  (DC) in PSG/PDS,  as we l l  as the useof  : le let ion ru les  in PSC./S is examined  andc r i t i c i zed .

In t roduct ionNoChomsky  has argued that a PSG is not suff_ic ient  to generate  all the grammat ica l  sent_ences of a language (Chomsky 1957:3~ ff.
).Recent ly ,  this conceot ion  of PSG has beenc r i t i c i zed  as be ing  too pr imi t ive  (Yngve1960:445a,  Harman 1963:604 fro), and severalways of improv ing  such a grammar  have beensuggested:  a PDS has been connected  wi th  aPSG (Yngve 1960, 1961, 1962); the use ofsubscr ip t  notat ion  has been recommended togive PSG a fa i r  chance in compet i t ion  withTG (Harman 1963).i.
PSG/PDSl.lo PSG and DCThe prob lem of the so_ca l led  d i scont inuoussonst i tuents  (for a deta i led  t reatment ,  seeWel ls  1947:96 ff.)
has always been a crux inIC analys is .
One of the drawbacks  of PSG asdescr ibed  by Chomsky,  is that it is not ableto handle  these const i tuents  in a way thatsat i s f ies  both  the formal c r i te r ia  of thegrammar  and the in tu i t ive  fee l ing  that ca l land up in, e.g., I ca l led h im u~, be long  to_gether  and shou ld  be t reated accord ing ly  inthe analys is .
Chomsky,  in his d i scuss ion  ofPSG l imi ta t ions ,  admits the poss ib i l i ty  of"extend ing  the not ions  of phrase s t ructureto account  for d i scont inu i t ies"  (ChomskyMey 41957:41) ,  but, he adds, "...fairly ser iousd i f f i cu l t ies  ar ise in any sys temat ic  attemptto pursue this course.
"An attempt in this d i rec t ion  is descr ibed  byV .Yngve in severa l  art ic les  (see espec ia l l yYngve 1960); a l though the presence of DCis the most annoy ing  of the compl i ca t ionsunder  the PSG model  (Yngve 1960:448a) ,  theso lut ion  ~f fered  to this par t i cu la r  prob lemimpl ies  a w ider  claim, namely,  that "anyshor tcomings  /o f  PSG, JM/ can be overcome"( Ib .
:445a) .
Accord ing ly ,  I wi l l  d i scuss  be_low not only  the problem of DC, but also themore genera l  one of s t ructure in a PSG/PDS.1o2o DC and PDSThe cruc ia l  step in the der ivat ion  of DC bythe automaton  (for a full descr ip t ion ,  seeYngve 1960:448_9)  is the quest ion  asked:Does the r ight  ha l f  of the grammar  rule inquest ion  (GRi) conta in  the symbol  "..." ?
(where ".. o" stands for "d i scont inu i ty  inrewr i t ing  the symbol  on the left  hand sideof the rule")  I f  the answer is Yes, we haveto roll  out the temporary  memory  (TM) ta~eone space (in a f low chart, one woul~ sym_bo l i ze  this by the index notat ion  1 - - I  --> i,where 1 stands for " leftmost":  " ro l l ing  in"tape would then be ind icated by 1 + ?
--> i,see Fig.
~).
Dur ing  this operation, theor ig ina l  content  of TM 1 (the le f tmost  loca_Mey 5t ion of TM) has to be kept in place, that is,the b lank  has to occur  af ter  the or ig ina l  TM 1(on the r ight  side, if the tape is thought ofas mov ing  f rom the left, see Fig?
~).
If, how_ever, the answer  is No, we have to make surethat we have space for all the symbols  on ther ight  hand side of the rule and rol l  out tapeaccord ing ly .
Let ~ be the number  of symbolson the r ight hand side of GRi: then we cansymbo l i ze  the ro l l ing  out by the index formulai -- (n -- ~ the f irst  symbol a lways goesto the comput ing  reg ister .Let fu r ther  ~ be the subscr ipt  for r ight  handside symbols  of GR i.
The rest of the operat ionis then per formed as rout ine count ing  on GRi.
,3 i be ing  set at 2 (the first symbol  has a l readybeen taken care of).
There should, of course,be a prov iso for the symbol "..." i tself ,  sothat it wi l l  not be cop ied onto the TM taoe.The method as descr ibed  here wil l  work  neat lyeven in those cases where DC are "nested~ thatis, if the expans ion  of some DC turns out tobe another  DC (and so on, at least theoret i ca l _ly).
As an example,  one may try out the doub lyd i scont inuous  as far as the corner,  where allthe necessary  rules are sDec l f ied  by Yngveh imse l f  (1960:449a) .An impl ic i t  assumpt ion  throughout  the descr ip_t ion  of the mechan ism is that  DC can be repres_ented by the s imple  fo rmula  A --> B + 9 ,o  + C .It fo l lows that there are two cases that  cannotMey 6be hand led  d i rec t ly  by  the mach ine :  the f i r s tone can  be symbo l i zed  by A --> B + ... + C +... + D ( "mul~p le  d i scont inuous  const i tuents" ) ;th is  reduces  eas i ly  to doub le  d i scont inu i ty  bya su i tab le  man ipu la t ion  of the inout  ru les .The  o ther  case  cou ld  be labe led  "d i scont inu_ous mul t ip le  const i tuents" :  fo rmula  A --> B +C + ..o + D (or some var ia t ion  on th is  theme) ,wh ich  wou ld  imp ly  that  the b lank  has to occurtwo spaces  f rom le f tmost  ins~ad of one.
Fo l l _ow ing  the ins t ruc t ions  g iven  by  Yngve  we wou ldnot obta in  the r ight  s t r ing  of symbo ls  in thiscase (as examples ,  one may try: He 's  not thatb in  a fool ,  or: As n ice  a l i t t le  par lo r  as everyou d id  see, or the Soan ish  sentence :  Hab la  masde lo que sabe 'He ta lks  more  than  what  he knows '(Bo l inger  1957:63) ,  where  common sense wou ldpre fer  the ana lyses  that b i~ ... foo l ,  as n ice( ?

Der ivat ion  be ing  d i f fe rent ,  there  wou ldbe no in ter fe rence  f rom const ruct ions  l ikethat b ig  fool ,  that  are t reated  in the normalway  by the mach ine .A dev ice  l ike the one descr ibed  here  wi l l ,w i th in  its obv ious  l im i ta t ions ,  be able torandomly  generate  sentences  that  are for themost  part qu i te  grammatical (Yngve  1962:70) .Mey 7The quest ion  is: wi l l  it generate  all, andonly, the grammat ica l  sentences  of a fang_uage?
I wi l l  try to answer  this quest ion  inthe next paragraph.1.3.
L imi ta t ions  of PSG/PD ~A l though the model  as proposed  by Yngve in itsor ig ina l  form only  uses the PDS techn ique  tosolve a minor  prob lem in syntact i c  ana lys isby  the machine,  the scope and use of  PDS areby no means l im i ted  to this par t i cu la r  pro_b lem of DC (For a deta i led  d i scuss ion ,  seeOet t inger  1961:126_7).
The e legancy  and s im_p l ic i ty  of PDS a lgor i thms make them wel l_su i ted for p rocedures  of automat ic  syntact i canalys is  of languages.There  are, however,  some inherent  l imi tat ions .Common to all  PDS techn iques  is the fact thatin fo rmat ion  s tored  in this way on ly  is access_ible in accordance  wi th  the fo rmula  "last in,f i rst  out".
Be ing essent ia l l y  a l inear  arrayof in fo rmat ion  (Oet t inger  1961: i04) ,  the user(the machine)  wi l l  not be able to draw on otherin fo rmat ion  than  is g iven  by the le f tmost  sym_bol in a le f t _ to_ r ight  p roduct ion  (the temDo_rary  memory  tape in Yngve 's  machine,  see F ig .
l ) .Since, on the one hand, the mach ine  output ispast contro l  (what is Dr inted,  is no longerava i lab le  to the mach ine  for inspect ion)  and,on the other  hand, the in terna l  state of themachine is ent i re ly  determined by  the currentinput symbol,  one has to keep carefu l  accountMey 8not on ly  of the current  der ivat lona l  steps,but also of the " le f t _overs"  f rom ear l ie rsteps.
Th is  is exact ly  what  a PDS can do,and the ~roblems in connect ion  w i th  thistechn ique  are, as shown above in the caseof the so_ca l led  d i scont inuous  mul t ip leconst i tuents ,  are main ly  techn ica l  (provid_ing indexes etc.
)The l inear  character  of the memory,  however,together  wi th  the f in i te state oropert ies  ofthe model  i t se l f  give r ise to a~other  prob lemthat seems unso lvab le  under  the fo l lowing ass_umpt ions  for our machine:  a f in i te  number  ofstates,  a l inear  temporary  memory,  and at rans i t ion  from one state into anether  by one_symbol  inout.
The prob lem is the fo l lowing:g iven  any internal  state of th~ach ine  that  isdetermined  by more than one symbol  s imu l tane_ousiy,  wi l l  the supp lementary  dev ice  of a PDSbe able to suDply the necessary  ins t ruct ionsto the mach ine  that are not conta ined  in thecur rent  symbol?The answer  is in the negat ive ,  p rec i se ly  be_cause the memory  is l inear,  and there is no" look_up"  for items in the memory?
What is stor_ed in the memory can only be brought  up to thesur face  by someth ing  outs ide  the memory  itself ,that is, I have to c reate  an "expectancy"  thatis spec i f i c  for each i tem in the PDS.
Onlyunder  these cond i t ions  the state of the mach inecan be de f ined  as determined  by the currentsymbol  plus the oontents  of the temporary  mem_ory (Yngve 1960:~49).
This  is essent ia l l y  theMey 9procedure  descr ibed  by Har r i s  for keep ingt rack  of nested const ruct ions  ( " incur renceand d ischarge  of requ i rements" ,  Har r i s  1962:53).
The reason why the mach ine  is able tohand le  DC is that this "nest ing"  occurs inone level,  so that the symbols  invo lved  canbe un ique ly  determined as be long ing  to thesame d imens ion  of analys is .Where  "sur face  s t ructure"  is exp la ined  onlyby under ly ing  "deed st ructure"  (Hockett  1959:246 ff .)
,  the mach ine  wi l l  not be able to carryout the analys is  correct ly .
The s t ructure  thatunder l ies  a symbol  X 1 may be bound up wi th  aspec ia l  PS der ivat ion ,  so that ru les  concern_ing s t ructures  like, say, X 1 + X 2 + X~ wi l lbe ambiguous  in the i r  a~pl icat ion .
One couldp lace res t r i c t ions  (in Harr is '  sense) on (oneof) the symbols,  thus c reat ing  a mul t ip le  paththrough the der ivat ion ,  poss ib ly  combined witha cyc l ing  device: this is what the subscr iottechn ique  does, see 2.4 for a deta i led  d iscuss_ion.
Some of the d i f f i cu l t ies  are removed inthis way, but others pers ist ,  l ike those caseswhere  pairs  of symbol  formulae  are invo lved(the so_ca l led  "~enera l i zed  t rans format ions"  ofear ly  TG, Chomsky  1957:113) ;  this point is alsod i scussed  below.
Whi le  p lac ing  too many restr_i c t ions  on the symbols  has ser ious d i sadvant_ages (some of wh ich  wi l l  be d i scussed  in sect_ion 2 of this paper),  it cer ta in ly  exceeds thecapac i ty  of the model  as descr ibed  by Yngve:his ru les  are all of the context_  f ree form.Mey I0Thus,  s t ructure  in a su f f i c ient ly  powerfu lPSG is not only a mat ter  of spec i fy ing  ther ight  rules, but also of choos ing  the r ightru les  and combin ing  them at the r ight  places.There  is sti l l  another  fac tor  that we haveleft  out of cons iderat ion  so far: the order_ing of the rules.
Yngve states that any orderwi l l  do: an a lphabet ica l  order  may be conven_lent (1960:445)o NOW this has two consequen_ces: f irst,  all of the rules have to be runthrough every  t ime a symbol  is expanded (per_haps on ly  a minor  drawback  in a computer_o r iented  analys is) ,  second, the advantages  ofo rdered  rules (economy, e legancy,  accuracy)are lost ( " forc ing al l  k inds of low_ leve ldeta i l  into the rules" , Bach  1964:53) .
Besides,o rder ing  of the ru les is ind ispensab le  incases  where  compl icated  h igh_ leve l  s t ructura ldescr ip t ions  are involved:  thus an immediateder ivat ion  of each non_termina l  symbol  all theway  down to word level  would  not be permit tedin any k ind of PSG, not even the most context_sens i t ive  ones.
Be ing  es~ent ia l l y  context_ f ree ,Yngve 's  grammar  wi l l  6~enerate what is usua l lyca l led  "kernel  sentences"  (Chomsky 1963:152):unambiguous  der ivat ion  of more complex  struct_urea (der ived sentences)  wi l l  on ly  be feas ib leunder  a careful  spec i f i ca t ion  of the order  inwh ich  the rules have to apply  (as an example,cf.
the d i scuss ion  of w__hh_transformations asdepend ing  on the in ter rogat ive  t rans format ionin Chomsky  1963:140).Mey iiThere  is another  way out of the d i f f i cu l t iesthat have been sketched in this sect ion: phrase_s t ructur i z ing  at d i f fe rent  levels,  these be ingkept together  by the representat ion  re la t ion(see Sga l l  1964b).
Th is  so lu t ion  is based  ona somewhat  d i f fe rent  in terprd~t ion  of PSGfunct ions  (not only  syntact ic ,  but also semant_ic ru les  az'e inc luded);  a PDS is coup led  w i ththe PSG of the lowest level.
A deta i led  d is_cuss lon  of this system wi l l  have to wait formore deta i l s ,  but it seems that grammars  basedon dependency  re la t ions  have rece ived  tool i t t le  a t tent ion  so far (for a compal i son  ofIC and dependency  theor ies ,  see Hays 1964:519_22)o1.4.
Grammar  and psycho lqgyRefer r ing  to exper iments  per formed by G.AoMi l l~r ,  Yngve es tab l i shes  an analogy betweenthe "depth"  of memory  ~n the human bra in  andthe depth  of sentence const ruct ion  in the model(1960:452) .
The human bra in  is not capable  ofs tv r lng  more than, say, seven plus minus twoi tems a t a time (for re ferences ,  see Yngveib id.)
.
In  other words, the human bra in  has al im i ted  capacity,  just l ike the temporary  mem_ory of Yngve 's  machine.
One of the cond i t ionsto be put on a f lawless  hand l ing  of "deep"const ruct ions  is that the storage capac i ty  isnot exceeded by the number  of symbols  to bedeve loped later on.
In this connect ion  Yngvemakes the in~ere~t ing  observat ion  that senten_ces and const ruct ions  in genera l  ac tua l ly  doMey 12have a sort of l imi ted depth,  i.e.
the numberof regress ive  nodes is bound by more or lessthe same uoper  l imit as that for human memory 'ss imu l taneous  storage caoac i ty .Now, I th ink  that the ana logy  between the twok inds  of "storage" should  not be overs t ressed.It rests  p r imar i l y  on the tacit assumpt ionthat the model  should,  or could, be cons ideredas a more or less t rue_ to_ l i fe  representat ionof human l ingu is t ic  act iv i ty .
As I have remark_ed before,  this suppos i t ion  is a l togetherground less ,  and wi l l  at best hamper  an exola_nat ion  of such act iv i ty  in t ru ly  l ingu is t i cterms.
A remark  made by Yn{~ve in this connect_ion may c la r i fy  the issue.
Yngve says (1960:452b; see also 1961:135_6  for an even more ex_p l ic i t  commitment) :"The depth  l im i ta t ion  does not apply  to a lgebra,for example,  because it is not a spoken langua_ge.
The user  has paper ava i lab le  for tempmrarys torage .
"But so has the user  of any other  language,  e.g,human everyday sooken language.
The fact thatwe do not use paper ac tua l ly  when speak ing  hasnoth ing  to do wi th  greater  or lesser  depth  ofsentences  (or, if it does, the depth  d i f fe rencesoccur  only  to one side, namely  that of decreas_ing depth) .
One could pursue this ana logy ad ab_surdum by assuming two k inds  of depth,  one un_l imited,  for wr i t ten  languages,  and one l imited,for spoken languages.
The resu l ts  would  be d is_ast rous  for any descr ip t ion  of any language:sentences  of the type: "That that that they areMey 13both  isosceles is true is obvious isn't  c lear"(Yngve 1960:458b)  are as ungrammat ica l  inwr i t ten  as they are in spoken Eng l i sh .
Ofcourse  Yngve is perfect ly  r ight in a t t r ibut_ing the d i f fe rence  between the above non_grammat ica l  (deep regress iv~ that_c lause  andits g rammat ica l  (p rogress ive)  counterpart:"It isn't  c lear  that it is obv ious  that itis true that they are both  i sosce les"  to ex_cess depth.
So, there is a depth  l im i ta t ionand this l im i ta t ion  is g ramat ica l ly  re levant .But this l ingu is t i ca l ly  f ru i t fu l  concept  shouldnot be confounded w i th  hypotheses  f rom des_c r ip t ive  psychology.That  the c la im for descr ip t ive  s imi la r i ty  be_tween psycho logy  and l ingu is t i cs  is latent inYngve 's  model  can be seen from another  instan_ce.
\]Iis second assumpt ion  for the model  (1960:445) is that "the model  should share with thehuman speaker  o.. the prooer ty  that words are{~roduced one at a t ime in the proper  time se_quence,  that is, in le f t _ to , r ight  order  ..."(the f irst assumpt ion ,  vim.
that any shortcom_ings of the PS model  can be overcome,  has Dart_1y been  deal t  w i th  above ,  and wi l l  be t reatedat length in the second ha l f  of this paper).Th is  rest r i c t ion ,  I think, on a model  (or agrammar,  insofar  as the grammar  is based  onthe model)  is unnecessary  and se l f_contrad ict_ory.
It is unnecessary ,  since the model  shouldon ly  copy re levant  t ra i ts  in the speech  pro_duct ion  of the ind iv idua l ;  and even though itmay be true that words are produced in a l inearHey 14sequence  (as  a l ready  Saussure  has remarked) ,  i thas not yet been  shown how this l inear i ty  is tobe in terpreted  in human speech  product ion:  Ith ink  it is on ly  weak ly  re levant ,  that is tossy, l inear i ty  a lone wi l l  never  suf f ice  tog ive a complete  p ic ture  of the speech  event.For a fu l l _ f ledged descr ip t ion  of speech Isuppose the assumpt ion  that we speak in senten_cesra  ther  than in words  wi l l  have many advant_ages .Moreover ,  the c la im that the model  should  du_p l icate  the proper ty  of le f t _ to_ r ight  p roduct_ion in the human speaker  cannot  be brought  toharmon2ze w i th  the model .
In fact, the model  canon ly  examine  one symbol  at a time: the mach inemay erase or delete or read only that sect ionof the memory  tape that is c losest  to the roll,i.e.
the lef tmost  symbol  on ly  (Yngve 196o:446) .Now, the l im i ta t ion  of human memory  is on re_I)roducing more than a cer ta in  number  of i temsat the same time.
The ana logy  c lear ly  does notho ld  between human memory  and mach ine  storage:the exp lanat ion  is that the machine producessymbols ,  whereas  the speech  of humans is s t ruct_ured.
In other  words, a le f t _ to_ r ight  product_ion may in many cases be exp la ined  by a l inears t ruc ture  in the oroducer ;  the pushdown storeis a l inear  memory  dev ice .
But there are otherle f t _ to_ r ight  p roduct ions  that are s t ruc turedin such a way that a PDS or other  le f t _ to_ r ighta r rangements  wi l l  not suf f ice.
It is of coursetrue that  a s t ructura l  descr ip t ion  is not a l to_gether  absent  from a PSG/PDS:  Yngve 's  mach ineproduces  as its output a s t r ing of symbolsMey 15conta in ing  both  syntact i ca l  markers  ( " f la t tened_out t rees")  and termina l  symbols .
Th is  wi l lsu f f i ce  to " in fer  the der ivat iona l  h i s to ry  ofeach  s t r ing  f rom that s t r ing  in a s ing le  way"(S~al l  1963:41) ,  but on ly  inso far  as the st ruct_ure can be descr ibed  in one_ leve l  terms,  cf.d i scuss ion  above (see also Sgal l  1963; 1964a).The quest ion  wi l l  be t reated  at l ength  in parttwo of this paper.2 p so/s2.1.
The  subscr ip t  notat ionThe subscr ip t  method re fer red  to here is notin the f i rst  p lace thought  of a s a mach inevprogram (even though its c lose a f f in i ty  ~ i ththe computer  language COMIT  is asser ted,  seeHarman 1963:608fn . )
.
Accord ing ly ,  i t  has amore genera l  scope: namely ,  to o f fer  a fu l l_f ledged a l ternat ive ,  in PS form, to o thergrammars  (e.g.
of t rans formst lona l  obed ience) ,thereby  prov ing  that " t rans format iona l  g ramm_ar has no adva ntage over  the phrase s t ruct_ure grammar"  (Harman 1963:598) .?
ubscr ip ts  are added to the PSG ru les  in twoways: f irst,  to in t roduce  res t r i c t ions  on suchru les,  second, to s:~ecify where those res t r_i c t ions  apply.
An example  of the f i rst  k indis the rule S --> S1 /NUMBER_SG (Harman 1963:609) ,and, in general ,  any rule of  the type A --> B/J+ o,o .
The second case obta ins  e.g.
in thefo l low ing  rule: NP/NOT_WI{ --> DETERMINER + NOUN,and, of course,  in all ru les  where subscr ip tsMey 16a re " lost"  dur ing  expans ion .
I th ink  there wi l lbe a th i rd type as well,  even t|iough this is notexpress ly  ment ioned in the ar t icLe ,  namely,  sub_scr ipts  that do both: in t roduce  new subscr ip tsat p laces ind icated  by old ones;  but this is on_ly a minor  point .
More impor tant  is the obser_vat ion  that subscr ip ts  can take care of allsorts  of const  itueJlts, both  cont inuous  and d is_cont inuous .
For  the latter,  the generat ion  ru_les are adapted  Prom rules suggested  by V ic torYngve (IIarman 1963:606;  the re ference  quoted  isYngve  1960).
L ike  in Yngve 's  model ,  the rulesof PSG/S  are unordered:  all necessary  in fo rma_t ion about when and where to a'iply a rule isconta ined  in the subscr ip ts  (which, by  the wayand perhaps a for t io r i ,  are said to occur  in anunordered  sequence) .
But, as w i l l  be seen f romthe fo l low ing  paFsgraphs,  this "when"and "where"is not on ly  a notat iona l  problem: in fact, itis one of the b ig  under ly ing  d i f fe rences  be_tween PSG and TG.
(0n the d i f f i cu l ty  of o rder ingru les in a PSG, see Chomsky  1957:35) .
A fu r therimpor tant  d i f fe rence  f rom other  PSG in terpreta_t ions is the admiss ion  of de le t ion  rules, thatis ru les  of the form A --> @ (Harman 1963:60~);also this point  wi l l  be d i scussed  at length below.2.2 .
Subscr ip ts  And Trans format ionsIn general ,  One cannot deny  the poss ib i l i ty  ofincorporat ing  (by means of subscr ip ts  or otherdev ices)  some of the in fo rmat ion  that is con_ta ined in a t rans format iona l  g rammar  into aMey 17~ne_ leve l  g rammar  of PS type.But the grammar  thus const ructed  w i l l  nevergenerate  all  and on ly  the grammat ica l  sent_enc~s of the language.
E i ther  it wi l l  generatetoo l i t t le  (the normal  case for PSG wi thoutsubscr ip ts  or s imi la r  dev ices )  or, if it gen_erates more,  it wi l l  a lso generate  some non_grammat ica l  sentences  (Harman 1963:611:" .
.
.not all sentences  const ructed  in accordancew i th  this g rammar  'are we l l _ fo rmed."
)A very  s imole  example wi l l  show this.
Supoosewe ~ant to t rans form opt iona l ly  a sentence in_to its quest ion  counterpar t .
To do this in thePSG/S  accord ing  to Harman,  we have to choosean appropr ia te  expans ion  of  the symbol  $2(the same paths hold for number_  and mode_res t r i c ted  S : S1, resp.
S2, Harman:600) ,  na_mely  e i ther  the second or the four th  rule in3., the set of expans ion  ru les  for $2.
Wechoose the second rule (normal  quest ion ,  thefour th  rule concerns  wh_quest ions) :S2 --> VP /TYPE_QUES,NOT_WH + NP/CASE_NOM,NOT_WH.Now, note  two things: in o rder  to conform tothe ru les  for this grammar ,  we have a l readyadded some of  the subscr ip ts  f rom Rules  1 and2 to the symbol  $2 (e.g., NUMBER_SG and MODE_ACT) .These  subscr ip ts ,  together  w i th  the new ones,are to appear  on every  symbol  that is conta inedin every  ru le  f rom now on (unless a de le te  sub_scr ipt  is in t roduced,  cf.
be low) .
Th is  is nec_essary,  s ince we cannot let any in fo rmat ion  thatis conveyed by the subscr ip ts  be lost, even ifMey 18it be i r re levant  to the symbol  in quest ion  (suchas, say, a MODE res t r i c t ion  on a NP).
One caneas i ly  imagine that rewr i te  ru les  of this typesoon become very  unwie ldy  ( even if we do nota l low ,u rse lves  to be f r ightened by the prospectsof "mi l l i ons  of rules",  Harman:605) .
Thus, inrule 7 of this comparat ive ly  s imple  grammar  wea l ready  have 6 subscr ip ts  to each symbol.
Th isnumber  is substant ia l l y  inc reased  in the moree laborate  vers ion  of the grammar  (see Append ixto Harman 's  ar t ic le) .
Th is  is cer ta in ly  notwhat one would  cal l  s imp l i c i ty  of descr ip t ion .\[Jut ob jec t ions  of this k ind can be met by thefo l low ing  cons iderat iun :  even if  the mul t iD l i _ca t ion  of entia,  i.c.
symbols  and subscr ipts ,seems wi thout  ra t iona le  for humans,  one canconce ive  of it as 8 necess i ty  for computer  datahandl ing,  and the computer  cer ta in ly  does notmind go ing  through all the subscr ip ts ,  add ingsome, de le t ing  others,  etc.,  every  time a sym_bol  is ment ioned  or expanded.
So, if one has awork ing  program in wh ich  these res t r i c t ions  canhe wr i t ten  out as subrout ines ,  and if the com_i)uter space needed does not exceed that ava i l _able, the ob jec t ion  just made does not hold(cf.
Harman:61Ofn .
:  "Many of these grammars  arein the form of computer  programs for generat ingactual  sentences . "
)The other  quest ion  is far more important.
It canbe spl i t  up into ~?o parts:i.
Can all the data  of the grammar  be put intothe subscr ip t_ res t r i c t ion  schema?2.
Wi l l  the subscr ip t_ res t r i c t ion  schema notMey 19put more data  into my grammar  than wnnted?The f i rst  quest ion  concerns  the adequate  re_presentation of the structure, the o ther  ex_presses  the fear that I may add s t ruc ture  tomy grammar,  thus oroduc in~ sentences  that arenot  g rammat ica l  (see Chomsky  1962:514f f .
)Adopt in~ a d i s t inc t ion  made by Chomsky,  Imake the fo l low ing  assert ion:  A PSG/S  wi l l  serveas a more or less adequate  observat iona l  anddescr ip t ive  representat ion  of the facts  coveredby a normal  PSG; as far as TG is concerndd,  thes t ruc ture  of the t rans format iona l  mode l  (howt rees  mad into trees)  wi l l  not be representedadequate ly  on the descr ip t ive  (and perhaps  noteven on the observat iona l )  level by  a PSG/S.In no case the PSG/S  wi l l  a t ta in  the level  ofexp lanatory  adequacy.The f i rs t  Dart of my asser t ion  can eas i ly  beproved  f rom the observat ion  that a normal  PSGand a PSG/S  are s t rong ly  equ iva lent  grammars ,the on ly  d i f fe rence  be ing  the notat ion .
(On thenot ion  of equ iva lence ,  of.
also Hays 1965:519).In fact,  it makes no d i f fe rence  whether  one ex_pands a symbol  on the bas is  of a ru le  to be af_f i xed  to the const i tuent  by  means of a sub_scr ipt ,  or on the bas is  of a rule conta ined  so_mewhere  else in the grammar.
The essent ia l  isthat  ~erat ion  proceeds  f rom left to r ight,  andone symbol  is F)roduced at a time.
(See d i scuss_ion above, 1.2).To Drove the other  ha l f  of the asser t ion  maleabove,  I wi l l  try to give an answer  to the two_MeT 20fo ld quest ion  about representat ion  of s t ruc t_ure.
Let ' s  go back  to the e lementary  exampleof the opt iona l  T , and try to imag ine  how this qis hand led  in a PSG/S.
The  main  d i f fe rence  be_tween PSG and TG is that the ru les  in PSG oper_ate on symbols ,  in TG on s t r ings  of symbols .When I put a subscr ip t  on a symbol  that is partof a str ing,  and I want  to mark  off  a s t ruc t_ure that is based  on severa l  symbols  occur r ingin a cer ta in  order, I w i l l  have to mark  a Iithe symbo ls  of my s t r ing  in the same way ,  andthis way  of :~larking must  be unique,  i.e.
de_f ine a un ique path through the rules.
Th is  pathmay, in due course,  requ i re  add i t ions ,  de le t ions ,permutations and the like.
Now, in TG these op_era t ions  are car r ied  out a f ter  the PS der iv&t ionhas been completed.
In PSG/S,  ho~Tever, thec leavage between a f f i rmat ive  and in ter rogat ivesentences  occurs  a l ready  in the th i rd  rule,where  $2 is expanded into NP + VP, VP + NP,respect ive ly  (omit t ing  the subscr ip ts ) .
Thetwo der ivat ions  fo l low separate  paths throughthe rules:  in terms of tree d iagrams,  what  isleft  in the one is r ight  in the other  of thetwo trees,  In this way, many PSG ru les  are un_necessar i l y  dup l i ca ted  (see above);  moreover ,the re la t ionsh ip  between in ter rogat ive  and de_c la ra~ive  sentences,  as de f ined  in TG, is reducedto a remote  common source of der ivat ion ,  namely$2.
It is not true that "Sentences  are ~rans_fo rmat iona l ly  re lated'  to the extent  that theMey 21same cho ice  of res t r i c t ions  is made in the i rder ivat ions  and if the same lexical  c',oicesare made where i~ossible" (Harman:608{ s inc lequotes  are his), un less  one takes " ' t rans for_mat iona l ly  re la ted ' "  in a sense ra ther  d i f fe r_ent f rom Chomsky 's ,  namely:  sentences  that havea (part ia l )  oath through the ru les in common.Th is  is, in fact, the only ' t rans format iona lre la t ion '  that it is poss ib le  to de f ine  in aPSG/S,  but unfor tunate ly ,  it is not t rans for_mat iona l .
Even  in the case that two paths coin_cide, and co inc ide  a l together ,  we do not have' t rans format iona l  re la tedness ' ,  but "grammat ica ls imi la r i ty"  (Harman:6OS) .
Lex iea l  cho ices  havenoth ing  to do wi th  this re lat ion:  both  in PSGand in rG the cho ice  on the lexical  level ismade a f ter  the aoDl i ca t ion  of expans ion,  reso_ec t ive ly  t rans format iona l  rules.
(This is nota l together  cor~.ect: lex ica l  cho ices  may be madeear l ie r  and thus af fect  the der ivat ion ,  butthis is bes ide  the point; complex  symbols  (seeK l ima 1964) are not taken  into cons iderat ionhere, but they cou ld  be bui l t  into a PSG aswel l  as into any o ther  generat ive  grammar.
Ithink,  e.g., that some com,~lex symbol  could bedev ised  to prevent  sentences  l ike The manwa lks  the men, that cou ld  eas i ly  be generatedin accordance  wi th  the rules descr ibed  on TIp.609_10 of Harmsn 's  ar t i c le .
)In my opinion,  a PSG/S  wi l l  never  be able toshow t rans format iona l  re la t ionsh ips  as fo rmal lyde f ined  and descr ibed  by Chomsky  and oZhers;hence such a grammar,  even though it may at ta inMey 22a cer ta in  descr ip t ive  adequacy ,  w i l l  never  g ivean exp lanat ion  of  the fac t  that  p rec i se ly  this,and not  some other  sentence ,  is t~ans formedin to  another  s t ruc ture .2o3.
De le t ion  in a PSGAnother  d i f f i cu l ty  in PSG/S  concerns  the prob lemof de le t ion  ru les .
In  normal  PSG, no de le tesare permi t ted  (Chomsky  1961:9)o  Harman g ives  asreason  for  th is  res t r i c t ion  that t rees  must  beun ique ly  recoverab le  in a I~SG (p.603) .
Th is  is,however ,  on ly  part  of  the mot ivat ion .
De le tesare not symbols :  they cannot  be expanded (un_less one chooses  to ex~)and them into  de le tes ,wh ich  is obv ious ly  use less  in a descr ip t ion)?Whenever  a de le t ion  ru le  occurs ,  the s t ruc tureof  the  der ivate  is a l te red  in such a way thatru les  may a~ply  wh ich  or ig ina l ly  shou ld  not.One cou ld  say that de le tes  are ext remely  con_text_sens i t i ve :  in !
{at;nan's PSG/S ,  wh ich  inrea l i ty  is a h igh ly  res t r i c ted  PSG, the numberof ru les  hav ing  the fo rm A- -> Z is very  l im i tedindeed,  even  though the author  advocates  the i ruse  (9 .605) .
In pass ing ,  I wou ld  l ike  to remarkthat near ly  al l  o f  the de le t ion  ru les  have todo w i th  the ex,oansion of  NP/I~H ( th i s  subscr ip toccurs  on ly  once in the smal le r  ~rammar ,  p.609,and shou ld  there fore  be re jec ted  by the mach ine ,s ince  there  are no const i tuents  on wh ich  theru le  cou ld  a~ply .
)The  rea l  reason  why  a de le te  cannot  be admi t tedin a PSG (espec ia l l y  a h igh ly  context_sens i t i veHey 23one) is that  the ru les  fo l low ing  the de le t ionru les  shou ld  be mod i f ied  or alte~'ed complete ly, o therw ise  it wou ld  not  be poss ib le  to keepthe d i s t inc t ion  between not_ rewr i t ten  and re_wr i t ten  symbo ls  c lear:  the ru les  fo l low ing  de_le t ion  might  thus operate  on symbo ls  or i f~inal lybe long ing  to the context .
(Note,  by the x?ay,that  in the case  of wh_words  the context  l~ro_b lem is somewhat  s imp l i f ied  by  the fact  thatthese  words  normal ly  s tand at the beg inn ingof  a sentence ,  so that the le f t  context  canbe thought  of as zero . )
In  our  example ,  thet rans format iona l  ru le  for  in ter rogat ive  sent_ences  to be generated  f rom dec la ra t ive  onesoperates  on a s t r ing  of  symbo ls  that  may besymbo l i zed  X 1 _ X 2 _ X 3 (Chomsky  1957: i12) ,car ry ing  it into the shade  X 2 _ X I - X 3.Now, suppose  that in the course  of  the der iv_Rt ion  to non_termins l  symbo ls  (the kerne ls t r ing)  we have a de le t lon  ru le  operat ing ,  say,on "( Suppose  moreover  that  the non_termina li ?symbo l  fo l low ing  X 3 qua l i f i es  for  the cond i_t ions  o r ig ina l ly  put on X 5.
The  t rans format io_nal  ru le  w i l l  then  operate  on a s t r ing  X 2 _X~ _ X4, and car ry  it into  X 3 _X 2 _ X~, thusgenerat ing  a non_grammat ica l  sentence .
I donot  p re tend  that the ac tua l  PSG/S  as Drooosedand descr ibed  by Harman in his a r t i c le  ~,,illgenerate  these  sentences :  as a l ready  sai~l, thegrammar  makes  a very  caut ious  use of  de le t ions ,so that  sentences  l ike the ones  ment ioned  w i l lnot  occur .
Th is  does  not,  ho~,yever, inva l idatethe c r i t i c i sm.Mey 24Subscr ip ts  may not only  be added in A PSG/S,but also de le ted .
In this manner  a res t r i c t ionthat has been put on a cer ta in  rule can be re_moved (this de le t ion  of subscr ip ts  is of coursequ i te  another  mat ter  than the de le t ion  of sym_bols  d i scussed  above).
Subscr ip ts  may be su)er_f luous, such as in Rule 8.1 (p.609),  wherethe subscr ip t  AUX_MODAL is removed f rom theconst i tuent  INF IN IT IVE  by the subscr ip t--AUX_MODAL, even though the lex icon  would o f fe rno ambiguous  rewr i tes  in the case of a non_removal  of the super f luous  subscr ip t .
One couldperhaps wonder  why this p recaut ion  is taken,s ince in many other  ins tances  super f luous  sub_scr ipts  pers is t  all the way through the der iva_t ion (see d i scuss ion  above).
In other  cases,the removal  of subscr ip ts  can be mot ivatedby the des i re  to orevent ungrammat ica l  " loops",i.e.
end less  recurs ive  expans ions  that have nojus t i f i ca t ion  in the grammar.
Thus  in Rule 8olthe symbol VP3/AUX_MODAL is expanded intoINF IN IT IVE /?
.
.
+ VP3/AUX_HAVE, - -AUY_MODAL,  thusprevent ing  another  expans ion  by the same ruleof VP 3.
If, on the other  hand, we w ish  thesymbol  in quest ion  to be expanded recurs ive ly(and accord ing  to the latest develo,)ment in TGthere should be no d i f f i cu l ty  in admi t t ingrecurs lv i ty  for all symbols,  S not excluded:see K l ima 1964),  we can res tar t  the cycle byw ip ing  our s late,  i.e.
de le t ing  all the sub_scr ipts  by means  of the ins t ruct ion  ERASE.0TIIERS,to be incorporated  as a subscr ip t  on the r ightMey 25hand side of the ruleo Natura l ly ,  we wou ld  ex_pect a subscr ipt  of this k ind to occur  in thosecases  where a who le  sentence  is to be embeddedinto another  hy means of what in ear ly  TG wasca l led  "genera l i zed  t rans format ions"  (Chomsky1957: 113) o Th~omina l i z ing  t rans format ion  isan ins tance  i~ ind"  under  ~g in the extendedPSG/S  (p.613), we find, among others ,  the entry:NP8 --> S l /CLAUSE.
TYPE:NOMINAL IZAT ION,  SUBJ.
INoGENIT IVE,  B, C ,D,E, Z,Y, ERASEoOTHERSThis  means that all the subscr ip ts  o r ig ina l lyfound on NP8 are to be deleted;  the new sub_sc r ip ts  deal  exc lus ive ly  w i th  the der ivat ionof the embedded c lause  (as can eas i ly  be ver i_f led from the ru les  of  the PSG/S  as g iven  inthe Append ix  of the art ic le) .
1~'hereas TG keepst rack  of the chan~es to be made by means of as t ruc tura l  descr ip t ion  of the pair  of  kerne lsentences  involved,  together  wi th  a fo rmula  forsh~/ctural change,  in PSG/S  we have only  a con_s t i tuent  NP to be expanded by means of DS rules?How this NP f its into the s tmucture  of the ori_g ina l  kerne l  sentence  (being essent ia l l y  itspath through the PS der ivat ion)  can be fo\] low_ed in .nSG by t rac ing back  the nodes of the treerepresentat ion .
In PSG/S,  this path is markedby the subscr io ts  added to the NP in quest ion .Now, all this in fo rmat ion  is s t ruck  f rom therecord  by the remova l  of the subscr ip ts  inac,:ordance w i th  the ins t ruct ion  ERASE OTHERS?~st ruCtura l  descri!

As onewi l l  have not iced,  the argument  in both  casesruns a lon~ the same l ines.
Moreover ,  of thesevera l  dev ices  proposed by Har:~an to boost  the.
