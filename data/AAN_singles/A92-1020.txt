LiuSoftware Research OfficeSampo Research InstituteAbstractThe paper eports on a new approach to automaticgeneration of back-of-book indexes for Chinesebooks.
Parsing on the level of complete sententialanalysis i  avoided because of the inefficiency andunavailability ofa Chinese Grammar with enoughcoverage.
Instead, fundamental analysis particularto Chinese text called word segmentation isperformed to break up characters into a sequenceof lexical units equivalent to words in English.The sequence of words then goes through part-of-speech tagging and noun phrase analysis.
All theseanalyses are done using a corpus-based statisticalalgorithm.
Experimental results have shownsatisfactory esults.I.
IntroductionPreparing back-of-book indexes is of vital importance tothe publishing industry but is a very labor intensive task.Attempts have been made over the years to automate thisprocedure for the apparent benefits of cost saving, shorterpreparation time, and possibility of producing morecomplete and consistent indexes.
Early work involvesusing occurrence characteristics of contents words \[Borko,1970\].
Later people came to realize that indexes are oftenmulti-word terms and their generation might involve moreelaborated syntactic analysis on phrasal or sentential level\[Salton, 1988; Dillon and McDonald, 1983\].
However, afull syntactical pproach \[Salton, 1988\] to this task has realproblem with efficiency and coverage for unrestricted text.No viable automatic solution is currently in use.Indexing Chinese books involves another severeobstacle, namely the word segmentation problem.
Chinesetext consists of a sequence of characters which roughly* This research was supported by ROC National ScienceCouncil under Contract NSC 81-0408-E-007-529.correspond to letters in English.
However, there are nospaces to mark the beginning and end of a word as inEnglish.
Until recently, this problem has been considereddifficult to solve without elaborated syntactical andsemantic analyses \[Chen, 1988\].Recent research advances may lead to the developmentof viable book indexing methods for Chinese books.
Theseinclude the availability of efficient and high precision wordsegmentation methods for Chinese text \[Chang et al, 1991;Sproat and Shih, 1990; Wang et al, 1990\], the availabilityof statistical analysis of a Chinese corpus \[Liu et al, 1975\]and large-scale lectronic Chinese dictionaries with part-of-speech information \[Chang et al, 1988; BDC, 1992\],the corpus-based statistical part-of-speech tagger \[Church,1988; DeRose, 1988; Beale, 1988\], as well as phrasal andclausal analyzers \[Church 1988; Ejerhed 1990\]2.
Problem descriptionAs being pointed out in \[Salton, 1988\], back-of-bookindexes may consist of more than one word that arederived from a noun phrase.
Given the text of a book, anindexing system, must perform some kind of phrasal andstatistical analysis in order to produce a list of candidateindexes and their occurrence statistics in order to generateindexes as shown in Figure 1 which is an excerpt from thereconstruction of indexes of a book on transformationalgrammar for Mandarin Chinese \[Tang, 1977\].Before phrasal analysis can be performed, the text mustgo through the more fundamental morphological nd part-of-speech analysis.
The morphological analysis forChinese text is mainly a so-called word segmentationprocess, which segments a sequence of Chinese characterinto a sequence of words.
See Figure 2 for illustration.The noun phrase generation process described in thispaper is based on a corpus-based statistical analysis anddoes not use an explicit syntactical representation.Examples of noun phrases found are underlined as shownin Figure 2.147~\[ l iangc i \ ]  measure word 15, 24, 38~\ [ l i enc i \ ]  conjunction 291,306~-\]~\[LiNa\] Li, C.N.

List of part-of-speechesThe constraint satisfaction problemThe constraint satisfaction problem involves theassignment of values to variables subject to a set ofconstraining relations.
Examples of CSPs include mapcoloring, understanding line drawing, and scheduling\[Detcher and Pear, 1988\].
The CSP with binary constraintscan be defined as follows: Given a set of n variables XI,X2 .
.
.
.
, Xn and a set of binary constraints Kij, find allpossible n-tuples (Xl, x2 ..... Xn) such that each n-tuple isan instantiation of the n variables atisfying(~, x\]) in Kij, for all Kij3.1.
Word SegmentationSegmentation through Constraint SatisfactionThe word segmentation problem for Chinese can besimply stated as follows: Given a Chinese sentence,segment the sentence into words.
For example, givenwe are supposed to segment i into\[ba/liuxianzhong/de/queshi/xiendong/cuo/le/fenxi\]Xian-Zhong Liu's exact action was given an analysis.where ~q (Liu) is a surname and ~ (Xian-Zhong) is alast name.
In the following, we will describe a method thatextends our previous work on segmentation \[Chang et al,1991a\] to handle surname-names \[Chang et al, 1991b\].Segmentation is solved as a constraint satisfactionproblem.Segmentation as a Constraint Satisfaction ProblemThe word segmentation problem can be cast as a CSP asfollows: Suppose that we are given a sequence of Chinesecharacter (C1, C2 ...... Cn) and are to segment the sequenceinto subsequences of characters that are either words in thedictionary or surname-names.
We can think of a solution tothis segmentation problem as an assignment ofbreak~continue (denoted by the symbols '>' and '='respectively) to each place X i between two adjacentcharacters Ci and Ci+l:ICl  IC21 Ca ...
I CnlXo x l  X2 ... Xn-l Xnsubject o the constraint that the characters between twoclosest breaks correspond to either a Chinese word in thedictionary or surname-names.
(For convenience, we addtwo more places; one at the beginning, the other at theend.)
So the set of constraints can be constructed asfollows:148For each sequence of characters Ci ..... Cj, (j >= i) whichare a Chinese word in the dictionary or a suruame-name,ifj = i, then put (>,>) in Ki-l,i.ifj > i, then put (>,=) in Ki-l,i, (=,=) in Ki,i+l ..... and(=,>) in Kj-1 ,j.For example, consider again the following:The corresponding CSP issinceK0,1 = {(>,>)},/(1,2 = {(>,=)},K2,3 = {(=,>),(=,=)},K3,4 = {(=,>)},K4,5 = {(>,>)},K5,6 = {(>,>)},/<6,7 = {(>,>),(>,=)},/(7,8 = {(>,>),(=,>),(>,=)},/<8,9 = {(>,>),(=,>),(>,=)},/ (9,10 = {(>,>),(=,>),(>,=)},/(10,11 = {(>,>),(=,>),(>,=)},/ (11,12 = {(>,>)},/ (12,13 = {(>,>),(>,=)},/ (13,14 = {(=,>)},~?i~1~4~1~'~17 I lmsilTIare either words in the dictionary or probable surname-names (hypothesized words).Typically, there will be more than one solution to thisCSP.
So the most probable one with highest product ofprobability of hypothesized words is chosen to be thesolution.
Ordinary words are listed in the dictionary alongwith this kind of probability estimated from a generalcorpus \[Liu et al, 1975\].
As for proper names such asChinese surname-names not listed in the dictionary, theirprobability are approximated by using another corpuscontaining more than 18,000 names as described in thefollowing subsection.The Problem with Proper Names in Chinese TextProper nouns account for only about 2% of averageChinese text.
However, according to a recent study onword segmentation \[Chang et al, 1991a\], they account forat least 50% of errors made by a typical segmentationsystem.
Moreover, proper names are oftentimes indexes.Therefore their correct segmentation is crucial to automaticgeneration of back-of-book indexes.The difficulties involved in handling proper names aredue to the following: (1) No apparent punctuation markingis given like capitalization in English.
(2).
Most ofcharacters in proper names have different usage.
So thisproblem has been held impossible to solve in thesegmentation process.
And it was suggested that propernames are best left untouched in the segmentation processand rely on syntactical and semantic analysis to solve theproblem when nothing can be made out of the charactersrepresenting them \[Chen, 1988\].
Using the corpus-basedstatistical approach, we have shown that it is possible toidentify most Chinese surname-names (~ ~fi) without usingexplicit syntactical or semantic representation.Most surnames are single character and some rare onesare of two characters (single-surnames and double-surnames).
Names can be either one or two characters(single-names and double-names).
Some characters aremore often used for names than others.
Currently, thereare more double-names than single-name in Taiwan.The formation of hypothesized surname-names itriggered by the recognition of a surname.
In the exampleabove, ~r\] (Liu) is one of some 300 surnames.Subsequently, we will take one character and twocharacters after the surname as probable last names, in thiscase ~ (Xian) and ~ ~q~ (Xian-Zhong).
A general corpus,G and a surname-name corpus N are used to evaluate theprobability of a surname-name.
For instance, theprobability of a most common kind of 3-character name(single-surname/double-name) such as J\[IJ~ ~ is :p( ~rJ~ ~, ) = p( single-surname/double-names in G) xp(~rJ being a surname in N) xP (~ being 1 st character in names in N) xP({~ being 2nd character in names in N)Names of other combinations can be handled similarly.The AlgorithmTo sum up, the whole process of word segmentation withsurname-name identification is as follows:1, Scan from left to right across the sentence2.
Check to see if the prefix of what is being scannedis a hypothesize word, by2.1.
dictionary lookup of an ordinary word and itsprobability2.2.
checking for the existence of a surname2.2.1.
forming possible combinations of thesurname-name2.2.2.
evaluating the probability of each combination3.
Post the constraints of the CSP and probability foreach hypothesized word4.
Solve the CSP5.
Find the most probable solution to CSP throughdynamic programming3.2.
Part-of-speech TaggingAs far as we know, there has been only scarce researchdone on part-of-speech tagging for Chinese \[Chang et al,1988; Chen, 1991; Bai and Xia, 1991; BDC, 1992\].
As forEnglish, there are at least three independently developed1Af~ 149taggers \[Church 1988; DeRose 1988; Beale 1988\].
Westarted out using an electronic dictionary \[Chen; 1991;Chang et al, 1988\] with a very elaborated part-of-speechsystem based on Chao's work \[Chao, 1968\].
Because it isdifficult o get sufficient manualy tagged ata for a largetag set, we have since switched to another electronicdictionary with some 90,000 entries and a much smallertag set.
The dictionary is actually abilingual one (Chinese-English) developed by Behavior Design Corporation\[BDC, 1992\].
The list of part-of-speeches is shown inFigure 3.
The algorithm is essentially the same as\[DeRose, 1988\].
The BDC Chinese-English Dictionary isused to obtain the list of possible part-of-speeches for eachsegmented word.
Currently, the collocation probabilitiesof part-of-speech are estimated from a manually taggedtext of about 4,000 words.3.3.
Finding Noun PhrasesInstead of using a full-blown parser to find noun phrases,we first mark the noun phrases in the same text of about4,000 words and compute the statistical characteristics ofcategoric patterns of noun phrase and then use the statisticsin a stochastic algorithm for finding noun phrases in amanner similar to \[Church 1988; Ejerhed 1990\].Extracting keywords from a noun phrase is somewhatheuristic unlike the rigorous approach of using thesyntactical structure within the noun phrase in \[Salton,1988\].4.
The Experimental ResultsThe algorithm described in Section 3 is currently underdevelopment and the programs are written in C andProFox, and run on an IBM PC compatible machine.
Thesegmentation, tagging, and NP identification parts arecompleted, while the statistical analysis of the occurrenceof NPs is being implemented now.
The statistics used inthe system consists of four parts:(S1) Appearance counts of 40,032 distinct wordsfrom a corpus of 1,000,000 words of Chinese text\[Liu el al., 1975\].
($2) The BDC Chinese-English Dictionary \[BDC,1992\].
($3) A general corpus of 300,000 words.
Some4,000 words of text from this corpus is tagged andmarked with NP.
($4) A name corpus of some 18,000 surname-names.The performance of the completed parts of the system isas follows: The hit rate of word segmentation is about 97%on the average.
For the surname-names alone, we get 90%average hit rate which eliminate about 40% of errorsproduced by our previous egmentation system.
About 98%of part-of-speeches are tagged correctly.
And about 95% ofthe noun phrases are found successfully.5.
Concluding RemarksThe preliminary results that we have obtained seem verypromising.
The approach presented here does not rely on afully developed Chinese grammar for syntactical nalysison the sentential level.
Thus the efficiency in systemdevelopment and generation of indexes is reasonable andcost of building and maintaining such a system isacceptable.
Currently, we are working on (1) handlingtranslated names, (2) improving the hit rate of tagging andNP identification by using a larger and more correctlytagged and marked training corpus, and (3) completion ofthe statistical analysis of occurrence of noun phrases.AcknowledgementsThanks are due to for Dr. Keh-Yih Su for making the BDCdictionary available to us.
