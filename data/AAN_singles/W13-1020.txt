The talk will focus onhow multiword expression identification is used indifferent kinds of educational applications, includ-ing automated essay evaluation, and teacher pro-fessional development in curriculum developmentfor English language learners.
Recent approachesdeveloped to resolve polarity for noun-noun com-pounds in a sentiment system being designed to han-dle evaluation of argumentation (sentiment) in test-taker writing (Beigman-Klebanov, Burstein, andMadnani, to appear) will also be described.About the SpeakerJill Burstein is a managing principal research scien-tist in the Research & Development division at Ed-ucational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey.Her background and expertise is in computationallinguistics with a focus on educational applicationsfor writing, reading, and teacher professional devel-opment.
