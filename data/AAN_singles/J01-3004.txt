Towards Constructive Text, Diagram,and Layout Generation forInformation PresentationJohn Bateman*Bremen UniversityJOrg Kleinz tGMD-IPSI, DarmstadtThomas Kamps tIntelligent Views, DarmstadtKlaus Reichenberger tIntelligent Views, DarmstadtCombining elements appropriately within a coherent page layout is a well-recognized and crucialaspect of sophisticated information presentation.
The precise function and nature of layout hasnot, however, been sufficiently addressed within computational pproaches; attention is oftenrestricted to relatively local issues of typography and text-formatting, leaving broader issues oflayout unaddressed.
In this paper we focus on the selection and function of layout in pages thatappropriately combine textual and graphical representation styles to yield coherent presentationdesigns.
We demonstrate hat layout offers a rich resource for achieving presentational coherence,alongside more traditional resources such as text-formatting and the text-internal marking ofdiscourse connections.
We also introduce an integrated approach to layout, text, and diagramgeneration.
Our approach is developed on the basis of a preliminary empirical investigationof professionally produced layouts, followed by implementation within a prototype informationsystem in the area of art history.1.
IntroductionThe desirability of combining text, layout, graphics, diagrams, punctuation, and type-setting in order to present information most effectively is uncontroversial--indeed, intraditional graphic design and publishing, they could scarcely be conceived of as sep-arate.
It is therefore natural that computational ttempts to synthesize texts, diagrams,and layout automatically should also now converge.
In this paper, we argue that effec-tive and coherent information presentation is best supported by adopting a commonframework for physical ayout and language/diagram generation.
Whereas previousresearch as made this point convincingly for graphical and textual representations--particularly, for example, in the WIP (Andr4 et al 1993), COMET (Feiner and McK-eown 1993), and SAGE (Kerpedjiev et al 1997; Green, Carenini, and Moore 1998)systems--we take this further and demonstrate that the same commonalities extendto include overall page layout, an area that has not previously received sufficientattention.?

(~) 2001 Association for Computational LinguisticsComputational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3The paper focuses on two aspects of automatic information presentation new inour work:?
a general mechanism for organizing presentations around informationalregularities in the data to be expressed--the r gularities then inform thepresentational strategies used for natural anguage, diagrarn, and layoutgeneration;?
the construction of an indirect relationship between structuredcommunicative intentions (typically represented in both mono- andmultimodal work by some kind of rhetorical structure) and theirexpression in page layout.The former allows us to ensure broad consistency of perspective and informationalorganization across elements presented using different media e.g., across diagramand text; the latter allows us to draw closer to the kind of sophisticated layout that isobservable in human-produced presentations.We organize the paper as follows.
We first introduce the mechanism for data-driven aggregation that we have developed, since this underlies our approach to bothnatural anguage generation and diagram design (Section 2).
We then sketch the placeof layout as an organizing framework within our approach as a whole (Section 3),setting out by means of examples ome of the issues focused upon in the empirical in-vestigation (Section 4).
We then summarize the results of the empirical study in termsof an abstract specification for performing page layout (Section 5) and provide a first il-lustration of its application within the prototype multimodal information-presentationsystem DArtbio (Dictionary of Art: biographies) (Section 6).
We conclude by summa-rizing the main contributions of our work and some of the follow-up research anddevelopment to which it is now leading (Section 7).2.
Data-driven Aggregation for Visualization and Natural Language GenerationIt is commonly recognized in work on multimodal information presentation that muchof the true value of such presentations lies in appropriate juxtapositions of non-identical but overlapping information.
Textual presentations and graphical presen-tations have differing strengths and weaknesses and so their combination can achievepowerful synergies.
Conversely, simply placing textual and graphical information to-gether is no guarantee that one view is supportive of another: if the perspective on thedata taken in a graphic and that taken in a text have no relation (or, worse, even clash),then the result is incoherence rather than synergy--cf, the discussions by authors uchas Arens, Hovy, and Vossers (1993), Fasciano and Lapalme (1996), Green et al (1998),and Fasciano and Lapalme (2000).One means of ensuring mutually compatible presentations across modes is todrive both the language and the graphic generation from the same communicativeintentions.
If an automatic natural anguage generator and an automatic graphic gen-erator both receive the task of expressing broadly similar, or compatible, intentionsthen there is a good chance that the resulting presentations will also be perceived tobe compatible and mutually supportive.
This has been used to good affect in systemssuch as CGS (Caption Generation System) of Mittal et al (1998), where it is clearlycrucial that the text and the graphic be in close correspondence.
Another, in someways related, approach is to derive both the graphic and textual elements from dif-ferent components of a single presentation plan: thus, for example, one part of the410Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generationpresentation plan might express textually an instruction that must be carried out (turnthe dial), while another part of the plan elaborates on that instruction by showing adiagram in which the location of the action to be performed is identified graphically.This has been explored extensively in systems uch as WIP (Andr~ et al 1993), PPP(AndrG Rist, and Mfiller 1998), and COMET (Feiner and McKeown 1993).While both of these approaches are essentially top-down, or goal driven, effectivepresentations can also be produced by responding to regularities found in the datato be presented.
Such regularities are difficult to predict as they are strongly contin-gent on what set of data happens to have been selected.
"Data-driven" methods ofthis kind are commonly found in automatic visualization, where the goal is to presentusers with some comprehensible view of large collections of data.
Utilizing regularitiesin the data is essential for effective visualization.
In previous work (Reichenberger,Kamps, and Golovchinsky 1995), a set of techniques for generative diagram designwere developed for precisely this task, i.e., for presenting overviews of datasets.
Wesubsequently recognized that this approach also has applications to the task of ag-gregation in natural anguage generation, and we thus adapted it for use across bothtextual and graphical presentation modes.
This provides a further technique for en-suring consistency between graphical and textual presentations--if both the graphicaland textual presentations express the same regularities, or redundancies, that havebeen found in a dataset, then they are necessarily compatible in this respect.
This al-lows us to use contingent data-driven organizations for generating information whilenevertheless preserving coherent and mutually supportive views across presentationmodalities.2.1 Data-driven Aggregation: the MechanismThe original generative diagram-design algorithms developed by Reichenberger,Kamps, and Golovchinsky (1995) built on the landmark work of Mackinlay (1986).Here, a data-classification algorithm flexibly links relational data with elements of agraphical language.
These elements are allocated particular degrees of expressivenessso that appropriate graphical resources can be selected as required to capture the databeing described.
Reichenberger t al.
extended this approach by employing a generaltype hierarchy of data properties to determine algorithmically the most specific propertysubtype (e.g., transitive, acyclic directed graph, inclusion, etc.)
that accurately describesa dataset to be visualized.
This subtype allows in turn selection of the particular formsof diagrammatic representation (e.g., trees, nested boxes, directed arrows, etc.)
that areexpressively adequate, but not over-expressive, for that dataset.The theoretical basis of these methods is given in detail in Kamps (1997; 1998).They rest on a new application of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) (Wille 1982).
FCA isan applied mathematical discipline based on a formal notion of concepts and concepthierarchies and allowing the exploitation of mathematical reasoning for conceptualdata analysis and processing.
In particular, FCA permits the efficient construction ofdependency lattices that effectively represent the functional and set-valued ependen-cies established among the domains of some data relation.
Such dependency latticescan then motivate the differential selection of appropriate graphical presentations.FCA starts from the notion of a formal context (G,M,I) representing a datasetin which G is a set of objects, M is a set of attributes, and I establishes a binary re-lation between the two sets.
I(g, m) is read object g has property m where g c G andm E M. Such a context is called a one-valued context.
For illustration, we draw onthe domain of the DArtbio system that we discuss below: an example of a one-valuedcontext corresponding to the attribute Profession for a set of artists is shown in thetable to the left of Figure 1.
Concepts in FCA are defined in accordance with the411Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3UrbanArchitect Designer PlannerGropius XBreuer XA.

Theextension is a subset A of the set of objects G and the intension is a subset B ofthe set of attributes M. We call the pair (A,B) a formal concept if each object ofthe extension has all the properties of the intension.
Thus, for the data shown inFigure 1, the pair ({Gropius, Breuer}, {Urban Planner, Architect}) represents a for-mal concept: each of the members of the extension possesses all the attributes men-tioned in the intension.
The set of all concepts for some formal context can be com-puted effectively using the Next Closure algorithm developed by Ganter and Wille(1996).The main theorem of concept analysis then shows that the set of concepts for aformal context can be organized into a complete lattice structure under the follow-ing definition of the subconcept relation: a concept (A,B) is a subconcept of (A*,B*)if and only if A c A* ~ B* _c B (Wille 1982).
The concept lattice may be con-structed by starting from the top concept (the one that has no superconcepts) andproceeding top-down recursively.
In each step we compute the set of direct subcon-cepts and link them to the respective superconcept until we reach the greatest lowerbound of the lattice itself (the existence of which is always guaranteed for finite-inputdata structures).
An efficient implementation f this algorithm is given in Kamps(1997).
The lattice corresponding to our example one-valued context is given to theright of Figure 1.
This lattice shows the full labeling of formal concepts in orderto ease comparison with the originating table.
Much of this information is redun-dant, however, and so we generally use variations on the abbreviated, more concise,form shown in Figure 2.
Such lattices naturally capture similarities and differencesbetween the values of the specified attributes of objects: each concept of the latticeindicates objects with some set of values in common.
Moreover, the generalizationsare organized by subsumption, which supports the selection of most-specific sub-types.When considering datasets in general, we typically need to express more informa-tion than that of single attributes and for this we require mult i -valued contexts.
Anexample of a multi-valued context is shown in Table 1, which includes our previousone-valued context as one of its columns; for ease of discussion, however, we willfor the present restrict he Profession attribute so that each artist has only one profes-sion.
The table shows the subject areas/professions, institutions, and time periods inwhich the indicated artists were active.
Formally, a multivalued context is a general-isation of a one-valued context and may be represented as a quadruple (G,M,W,I)where G, M, and I are as before, and W represents he set of values of the attributes--412Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page GenerationArchitectHilberseimer__ DesignerBreuer ~Figure 2Concept lattice example, more succinctly labeled.
Here, the extension label for each nodeconsists of just those elements which are added at that node moving up the lattice; converselythe members of the intensions are shown moving down the lattice, again adding just thoseelements that are new for that node.
For example, the node labeled simply Gropius, Breuercorresponds to the full form ({Gropius, Breuer}, {Architect, Urban Planner}) since bothGropius and Breuer are newly added to the extension at that node, while no new elements areadded to the intension--'Architect' and 'Urban Planner' are both inherited from above.Table 1A collection of facts concerning artists and their professions drawn from the frame-baseddomain model used for the Dictionary of Art: biographies and re-expressed asa table of factsand attributes.

To identify the value w c W of attribute m E M for an objectg E G, we adopt the notation rn(g) = w and read this as attribute m of object g hasvalue w.Kamps (1997) renders multivalued contexts amenable to the techniques for depen-dency-lattice construction by deriving a one-valued context that captures the func-tional dependencies of the original multivalued context.
To see how this works, wefirst note that a functional dependency in a relation table is established when the fol-lowing implication is always true: for two arbitrary objects g, h E G and two domainsets D,D* E M, then D(g) = D(h) ~ D*(g) = D*(h).
This implication suggests thefollowing construction for an appropriate one-valued ependency context: for the setof objects take the set of subsets of two elements of the given multi-valued contextP2(G); for the set of attributes take the set of domains M; and for the connecting inci-dence relation take IN( {g,h}, m) :~=~ m(g) = m(h).
The required dependency context isthen represented by the triple (P2(G),M, IN).
This is illustrated in the table to the leftof Figure 3, which shows the one-valued context corresponding to the multivaluedcontext of Table 1.
An entry here indicates that the identified attribute has the same413Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3Person Profession School Workperiod ~ ProfessionScho m(gl)=m(g6)glg2 X X m(g4)=m(gS) m(g2)=m(g6)glg6 Xgag6 x Period \]_ \[ m(gl):m(g2)g3g4 X X m(g3)=m(g4) ~ '~L  _g4g5 X t 'ersonFigure 3Example dependency ontext and corresponding lattice.value for both the facts identified in the object labels of the leftmost column: for exam-ple, gl and g2 share the values of their Profession and School attributes.
This providesa wholistic view of the dependency structure of the original data and is, moreover,computationally simple to achieve.It is then straightforward toconstruct a dependency lattice as described above; thisis shown to the right of Figure 3.
The arcs in this lattice now represent the functionaldependencies between the involved domains, and the equalities (e.g., m(gl)=m(g2))represent the redundancies present in the data.
For example, the lower left node labeledPeriod indicates not only that the third- and fourth-row entries under Period (g3 andg4) are identical but also, following the upward arc, that these entries are equal withrespect o School; similarly, following upward arcs, the middle node (m(gl)=m(g2))indicates that the first- and second-row entries (e.g., gl and g2) are equal with respectto both School and Profession.
The lattice as a whole indicates that there are functionalrelationships from the set of persons into the set of professions, the set of periods, andthe set of schools.
A further functional relationship exists from the set of periods intothe set of schools.Once such a lattice has been constructed, we also have as a consequence a setof classifications of the original relational input, or dataset.
This can directly drivevisualization as follows.
For graphics generation, it is important hat all domains ofthe relation become graphically encoded: this means the encoding is complete.
Kamps(1997) proposes a corresponding graphical encoding algorithm that starts encoding thebottom domain and walks up the lattice employing a bottom-up/left-to-right strategyfor encoding the upper domains.
The idea of this model, much abbreviated, is thatthe cardinality of the bottom domain is the largest, whereas the domains further upin the lattice contain fewer elements.
Thus, the bottom domain is graphically encodedusing so-called graphical elements (rectangle, circle, line, etc.
), whereas the upperdomains are encoded using graphical attributes (color, width, radius) and set-valuedattributes that must be attached to graphical elements.
In general, it is preferableto maximize graphical attributes over set-valued attributes as this keeps graphicalcomplexity moderate.Figure 4 shows two example diagrams that are produced from the dataset ofTable 1 via the dependency lattice shown to the right of Figure 3.
Informally, fromthe lattice we can see directly that artists (Person) can be classified on the one handaccording to work period (following the lefthand arc upwards) and, on the other hand,jointly according to school and profession (following the vertical arc).
The algorithm firstallocates the attribute Person, indicated in the lowest node of the lattice, to the basicgraphical element rectangle; the individual identities of the set members are given bya graphical attachment: a string giving the artist's name.
The functional relationshipbetween the set of persons and the set of time periods is then represented by the further414Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation', \[ \[ a.Albers i E l  Uan'ard'_ .

This is motivated by the equivalenceof the properties of temporal intervals in the data and the properties of the graphicalrelationship of spatial intervals on the page.
Two paths are then open: following thefunctional relationship first to either a set of schools or to a set of professions.
Diagram (a)in Figure 4 adopts the first path and encodes the school relationship by means of thefurther graphical attribute of the color of the rectangle, followed by a nesting rectanglefor the relationship to Professions; diagram (b) illustrates the second path, in whichthe selection of graphical encodings is reversed.
Both the selection of color and ofnesting rectangles are again motivated by the correspondence b tween the formalproperties of the graphical relations and those of the dependencies observed in thedata.
Reinstating the multiple professions of Gropius and Breuer mentioned in Figure 1gives rise to a rather different dependency lattice in which the second solution is nolonger possible.All of these mechanisms were implemented and used extensively for visualizationin the context of an Editor's Workbench for supporting editorial decisions during thedesign of large-scale publications uch as encyclopedias (Rostek, M6hr, and Fischer1994; Kamps et al 1996).
12.2 The Partial Equivalence of Diagram Design and Text DesignA selection of particular graphical elements entails the expression of particular func-tional dependencies.
This is similar to decisions that need to be made when generatingtext.
For instance, the equality rn(gl) = re(g2) in the lattice of Figure 3 above can alsomotivate a particular grouping of information in a corresponding linguistic presenta-tion.
That is, whereas graphically the equality motivates an association of both Gropiusand Breuer with the graphical attributes allocated to Professions and Schools, textuallywe may connect both artists in a single sentence: i.e., gl (concerning Gropius) and g2(concerning Breuer) can be compactly expressed by collapsing their (identical) schooland profession attributes:Both Gropius and Breuer were architects and taught at Harvard.A similar phenomenon holds for the grouping re(g3) = rn(g4); here, g3 (concerning A.Albers) and g4 (concerning J. Albers) may be succinctly expressed by collapsing theiridentical period and school attributes.1 Init ia l ly  deve loped w i th in  the European Un ion  Research  and  Deve lopment  in AdvancedCommunicat ions  Techno logy  in Europe  (RACE) pro ject  2042 EUROPUBLISHING (H( iser  et al 1995).415Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3Combining these considerations motivates the following approximate textual re-rendering of diagram (b):Anni Albers (who was a designer) and J. Albers (who was an urban planner)both taught at the BMC from 1933 until 1949.
Moholy-Nagy (who was also anurban planner) taught from 1937 until 1938 at the New Bauhaus.
Gropius andBreuer (both architects) were, at partially overlapping times (1937-1951 and1937-1946 respectively), at Harvard.
Hilberseimer (who was an architect too)taught at the IIT from 1938 until 1967.A textual re-rendering of diagram (a) would reflect he contrasting roupings entailedthere: i.e., Breuer, Gropius, and Hilberseimer would be grouped at top level whereasthe two Albers would not.A dependency lattice extracts partial commonalities that remain constant oversubsets of the data to be presented and this is closely related to the problem of ag-gregation in NLG (cf., Dalianis \[1999\]).
The functional redundancies captured by thelattice construction are precisely those redundancies that indicate opportunities forstructurally induced aggregation.
Selecting a particular graphical element or attributeto realize some aspect of the data is in fact an aggregation step.
In Bateman et al(1998), we have shown this in terms more familiar to NLG by re-interpreting in de-pendency lattice terms some of the standard examples of aggregation discussed inthe literature.
Below, we show that mutual consistency between textual fragmentsproduced by our NLG component and graphical elements produced by the automaticvisualization component can be enforced by driving both from a common dependencylattice.3.
Preliminaries for Layout: Inputs and Outputs for the Layout Determination TaskPage layout, more properly termed typographic design, is usually divided into threelevels: microtypography, macrotypography (layout proper), and style.
Here we aremost concerned with macrotypography--the segmentation of a page of informationinto more or less closely related "visual blocks."
Macrotypography is a central com-ponent of professional document design; indeed,Every designer knows that how elements are put together on a pagecommunicates a powerful message (Adobe Inc., InDesign product in-formation sheet).Unfortunately, with some valuable exceptions (cf., for example Schriver \[1996\], Waller\[1988\] and Bernhardt \[1985\]), the professionals do not then go on to tell us just whatthat message might be.Our starting point for investigating layout and its message rests on the fact thatlayout is not a fixed property of information presentation; i.e., similar information canbe subjected to diverse layouts.
We then assume, following Schriver (1996) and others,that layout decisions should be functionally motivated in terms of a presentation'scommunicative purposes.
We illustrate this further, while at the same time settingthe scene for our empirical investigation, by briefly considering the kinds of layoutvariation that are commonly found.
We do this in two steps.
First, we characterizemore finely the notion of layout as such; then, we consider how selections amongpossible layouts may be motivated.416Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation3.1 Layout structureIssues of layout were already present within the visualization framework discussedabove.
For example, the relationship of the graphical blocks representing particularartists, or the positioning of the diagrams' legends with respect o the diagrams them-selves, all involve decisions of layout.
The solution developed as part of the automaticvisualization component used in the Editor's Workbench was to consider layout itselfas a particular class of diagrams, with their own particular properties and concerns.An automatic page-layout component (APALO) was accordingly implemented as aspecialization of the general visualization task.Fully specified layout diagrams pecify the physical placement and appearance ofelements on a page.
In order to generalize across such layouts we define an abstractlevel of representation called Layout Structure.
Layout structure abstracts across theprecise details of physical layouts to focus on classes of layouts that are visually"equivalent."
Visually equivalent layouts suggest he same page blocks, with similarinter-block relationships of perceived prominence and similarity.Our view of layout structure draws heavily on Southall (1992), who defines a re-stricted set of typographical relation types.
These include: containment, i.e.
recursiveblock structure; reading order, i.e., generally left-to-right, op-to-bottom reading pathsin Western cultures; similarity, describing blocks that share some visual propertiessuch as size, typeface selection, structure, etc.
; and reference, where a connection be-tween visual blocks is suggested by physical proximity.
We represent layout structuresin terms of a tree structure (representing containment) augmented by a restricted setof possible additional annotations corresponding to the remaining typographical rela-tion types.
The annotations thus serve either to further constrain the possible physicallayouts that may render the layout structure, or to place mutual constraints on the ren-dering possibilities--for example, a type-equivalence annotation requires consistencyin rendering decisions across the units declared to be type-equivalent.A simple example of layout structure and its correspondence to a physical layout isshown in Figure 5.
Here we see that annotations also provide a numerical summary ofthe information to be displayed in any layout element (which may be either descriptiveor denote a target): for example, node 2.3.2 in the figure is annotated 403w+3p:50,indicating that it consists of a block of text with 403 words and 3 pictures, and isallocated an importance score of 50%.
2 These scores impose target visual weights forcorresponding page elements (i.e., more important nodes should be more prominent,which can be achieved by larger surface area combined with less but more heavy type,by use of prominent colors, etc.).
More information concerning layout structure andits motivation is given in Reichenberger t al.
(1996).Given a fully specified layout structure as input, APALO renders it as a physicalpage by mapping constituency to nested boxes (i.e., inclusion diagrams), and strengthof connection and sequence to spatial displacement: the boxes included within an en-closing box are arrayed two-dimensionally to influence reading order.
Typographicattributes, such as type size, specific type face within the family (bold, italic etc.
),arrangement of the type (ragged right, flush matter, etc.
), leading, coloring and orien-tation, are all assigned at this stage, respecting any constraints on presentation givenin the abstract layout structure.
Since it is rarely the case that a layout structure isso tightly specified that only one physical ayout is possible, the implementation usesprogressive refinement and allows a user either to stop the process at any point or2 The numbering ofthe nodes tarts with 2.3 to maintain ready comparability with the discussion iReichenberger et al (1996).417Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3typeequivalence I \] nonterminal\]J" ..... "\ refers tofollows %_~)  terminal2.3Figure 5Example layout structure and its correspondence to a segment of page layout (adapted fromReichenberger t al.
1996).
The "follows" annotation requires a page rendition where the readerwill encounter 2.3.1 before 2.3.2, and the "refers to" links attract he type equivalent units 2.3.3and 2.3.4 towards 2.3.1 without establishing a further visual block contrasting with 2.3.2.to continue searching for better layouts until a stable state is achieved.
The renderingaspect of APALO corresponds broadly to other components that have been designedfor page layout (e.g., Feiner \[1988\] or Graf \[1995\]), but differs from these in that it isnot restricted to any particular page model (e.g., a grid system).Our subsequent considerations of layout motivation adopt fully specified layoutstructures as their target.
Such structures will include presentation content as producedby the natural-language-generation and automatic-diagram-generation components intheir terminal elements, and are responsible for enforcing communicatively effectivelayouts.3.2 Communicative-Functional Structure and its Relationship to Layout StructureFor automatic information presentation we also require a representation f the com-municative intentions to be fulfilled by a presentation.
For this, we adopt "standard"rhetorical structure theory (RST) as set out in Mann and Thompson (1986).
RST is se-lected for two reasons: first, it is one of the most elaborated and widely used forms ofanalysis of communicative intentions and has been applied to a wide variety of texts;and second, it is well established in NLG and has already been applied to multimodalinformation presentation (cf., Andr6 and Rist \[1993\]).Originally, RST sought to describe the recursive structure of any text in termsof rhetorical relations which hold between the segments (called spans) of the text.Rhetorical relations are either symmetric (multinuclear), in which case the text spansrelated are considered of equal importance for the text, or assymetric, in which case onetext segment among those related by a relation is singled out as being more essentialto the writer's purposes (the nucleus) than the others (the satellites).
RST definesitself as a functional theory, in that the segments related are functional rather thantextual--i.e., a rhetorical relation need not have any specific grammatical or lexical418Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation\[1\] There are many reasons that the Bauhausmovement spread to the U.S. \[2\] For example,more people became aware of their work in mag-azines.
\[3\] Also, Bauhaus-designed objects cameonto the market in increasing numbers.
\[4\] Butthere were two main reasons.
\[5\] First, many ex-Bauhaus members emigrated to the U.S. \[6\] Andsecond, they started teaching Bauhaus methodsin U.S. colleges.1-6I-3\[1\] 2-3_A\[2\] \[314-6\[4\] 5-6_A\[51 \[6\]Figure 6An example text representing both itself and its underlying propositions, and thecorresponding communicative-intentional text plan represented in terms of RST.realization.
RST's functional orientation supported a further re-interpretation f RSTin which rhetorical relations become plan operators for text construction (cf., Mooreand Paris \[1993\]; Hovy \[1993\]).
From this perspective, rhetorical structures represent aplan for achieving some goal via linguistic means.
The information maintained at theleaves of such RST text plan structures i thus not pre-existing text, but rather chunksof information that are to receive textual realizations.If, as is common in NLG, we consider the information-presentation ask to involvethe expression, or realization, of a text plan expressed according to RST and, further, wesee the layout used in that information presentation as one of the decisions that needsto be made, then we face the question as to whether the text plan can also motivatethe necessary layout decisions.
In Figure 6, we show a simple invented text fragmentand a corresponding RST analysis.
We will use this text in two ways: First, it standsas a shorthand for a set of propositions from the knowledge base or domain mode l - -during NLG, and following text planning, the rhetorical structure is as shown but theleaves identify the propositions indicated rather than textual elements.
Second, the textstands as one possible result of the subsequent NLG process, where the propositionsgrouped in the text plan have already received their linguistic realization.
This doubleuse is harmless because we do not use the textual version to motivate any of thedecisions taken during the NLG process whose task it is to produce it.The RST structure states that the text divides into two main segments, span (1-3)and span (4--6), and that these are related by the rhetorical relation concession.
Thisindicates that the main allegiance and point of the writer lies with the nucleus (span 4-6), but that, at the same time, the writer does not claim that the seemingly contradictoryinformation in the satellite (span 1-3) does not hold.
The principal purpose of using anRST-concession relationship is to strengthen one's own argument by showing that oneis aware of a possible objection but are already able to dismiss it.
Common linguisticmarkers of concession are however, although and, as adopted here, but.
In the embeddedtrees, the satellite tree involves an RST justify relationship between a (relative) nucleus(1) and the span (2-3), the nucleus tree involves an elaboration relationship betweena (relative) nucleus (4) and the span (5-6).
Both spans (2-3) and (5-6) are examplesof the RST joint schema: this simply combines the connected propositions into a setwithout assigning any difference in nuclearity among them.
A justify relationshipholds when the satellite gives information intended to justify the writer's right to419Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3present he information in the nucleus (i.e., in this case, the claim that there are manyreasons for the Bauhaus preading is backed up by the examples offered in (2) and (3));and the elaboration relationship holds when further specifying information concerningsome aspect of the nucleus is given.
There are approximately 25 RST relations in thestandard set and space precludes giving more details of them here: their definitionsand examples of use are given, however, in numerous places in both the computationaland (text-)linguistic literature.The realization of an RST structure as a natural language text involves manyimportant issues which we will also not address here.
Instead, we focus on the rela-tionship between an RST-style presentation plan, and layout decisions; in particular,given our goal of determining a layout structure that can then be rendered as a physi-cal page layout, we ask how the information in a rhetorical structure may be placed incorrespondence with appropriate layout structures.
In the text of the previous figure,for example, one layout decision that could be made is that there is no particular lay-out to be done--this is then equivalent to a straightforward, monomodal NLG systemproducing text only.
The text in the figure is already an example.
Another possibledecision, lying at the opposite extreme, is to say that every node of the RST structureshould find some direct correspondence in a node of the layout structure.
This wouldbe to require that the entire constituency structure of the RST tree be signaled visuallyin the layout.
While both options are possible, it should be clear that there are manyothers.
For example, span (1-3) could be represented as a single layout element (i.e., asingle visual block consisting of a text paragraph) with span (4-6) breaking down into,perhaps, a single layout element for the nucleus (6) and two further layout elements,one for each of the members of the satellite.The situation is made yet more complex by the presence of a steady trade-offbetween information expressed via layout and information expressed via text.
Forexample, if the spans (1-3) and (4-6) are allocated to distinct layout units, allowingthem to vary independently of one another in terms of microtypography and physicalplacement, hen it is considerably less likely that the RST concession relationship willbe preserved linguistically.
Similar considerations arise within the two spans: the morethe RST structure is decomposed, resulting in typographical distinctions, the less useis made of explicit linguistic discourse marking.
A compelling illustration of this canbe seen in the complex graphic-text combination discussed in Kerpedjiev et al (1998)in which a text fragment is re-expressed graphically.This variability needs to be brought under motivated control.
Information pre-sented together, or in similar styles, is perceived as related regardless of whether thiswas intended by the page designer or not; conversely, information presented in differ-ent styles, or separated widely on the page, is interpreted as unrelated.
Critical workin professional document design demonstrates that failure to respect such entailmentsof layout makes a page or diagram difficult to interpret and possibly misleading: see,for example, Schriver (1996) and the numerous references cited there.
But it is also wellknown that not all of the possible details of document structure are normally presentedin layout: the relationship is substantially more flexible.
This presents a problem forany approach to multimodal presentation that adopts too close a relationship betweenpresentation-plan elements and layout--as most previous ystems have in fact done.4.
A Methodology for the Empirical Investigation of Communicative-FunctionalPage LayoutGiven our goal of understanding more precisely what can happen between a specifi-cation of communicative intentions--expressed in terms of a presentation plan using420Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generationa representation such as RST--and a fully specified layout structure that passes onintention-appropriate constraints o a page-rendering engine, we embarked on an em-pirical investigation ofthe kinds of variability that occur in real documents.
For this, wedeveloped a methodology for exploring the functional basis of page layout in general.Two caveats are required here: first, our experimental method was exploratory--asone of the first studies of its kind, we needed to respond with flexibility to the resultsof the analysis; and second, since our aim was to move quickly from first analysisresults to prototype system in order to evaluate the feasibility and value of the entirescenario in practice, the study was deliberately restricted in scope.4.1 Method of AnalysisThe provision of appropriate multimedia corpora for supporting the kind of empiricalanalysis we required is still, several years later, very much in its infancy.
3 The maincriteria for the selection of pages for our investigation were (a) that the entire pagebe concerned with a single topic, while nevertheless presenting various aspects ofthat topic by means of varied text structuring and typographical nd layout decisions,and (b) that the page demonstrate "interesting" layout.
This led us to consider pagesdrawn from popular magazines, ince these exhibit highly varied typographical ndlayout decisions in the hope of being eye-catching and maintaining interest.The detailed structure of our study was as follows.
We took a set of pages selectedaccording to criteria (a) and (b), and asked for each page why it was set out as it was.We answered this question by:?2....providing a layout structure representation for each page;constructing a single "text" out of the entire "content" of the page(including headings, picture captions, pictures, etc.)
that captured as faras possible the perceived purpose of the page;performing a "functional text structure analysis" of the constructed textrespecting the perceived purpose of the page (and therefore of theconstructed text);considering whether the page-layout s ructure could be derivedstraightforwardly from the text structure;deriving and informally evaluating alternative "possible" layouts on thebasis of a progressively refined set of layout principles.We illustrate our approach by setting out in detail one round of analysis concerninga single illustrated page.
The page used is shown in Figure 7 and is drawn fromthe German illustrated sport and health magazine Fit for Fun (1995 (5), 92).
The articledescribes various aspects of the game Unihoc, presenting background information con-cerning how the game is played, where it is popular, and why it is popular, as wellas some pointers to further information and the equipment needed to play it.
Thepage was typical of a series of feature articles being run in the magazine at that time.Particular elements expressed using layout in the page are indicated in the figure:significant here is solely the physical layout of the page, not the content.3 Two projects currently involved with gathering and annotating such data re ICONOCLAST(Bouayad-Agha, Scott, and Power 1996) and GEM (Delin, Bateman, and Allen, forthcoming).

The page is annotated here toshow the major layout units.4.2 An Illustrative Round of Analysis: PreparationThe starting point for our analysis was provided by our initial page-selection criteria,i.e., that there is some body of material that the author(s) of the page wish to present.It is then relevant (and necessary) to ask how this information is to be broken upfor effective presentation.
To do this, we set out the content of each page as a singleconstructed text: The constructed text for the Unihoc page is given in Figure 8.
Notethat this text already reflects our understanding of the function of the page in itscontext of use: we assume that the page has the main functions of informing readersabout a game that they might not be familiar with and telling them that the game isin fact finding increasing support both internationally and nationally.This approximate, "pre-analytic" understanding of the page's communicative func-tion is then made more explicit by providing a detailed functional text-structure analy-sis using RST.
The RST structure offers a plausible presentation plan that can serve as astarting point for considering possible and contrasting realizations of this informationas a two-dimensional page.
The constructed text has to then be viewed in a similarway to the example fragment concerning the Bauhaus that we used in Section 3,2.In many respects, it is not a text at all, in that it overcommits to particular forms oflinguistic expression and linear ordering.
NLG uses of RST do not (in general) allowthe RST structure to specify particular relative orderings between nuclei and their re-spective satellites.
The ordering needs to be decided during generation so that issuesof textual fluency can be addressed appropriately.
The same then holds for our con-422Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation\[0\] Astrid Frula, captain of the German National Unihoc team, writes: \[1\]Among the Swedes it is the most popular and best-known branch of sport.\[2\] We are talking about Unihoc, also called Floorball or Indoor Bandy.
\[3\]This mixture of hockey and ice hockey is attracting ever more supporters.\[4a\] Since the middle of the eighties, this dynamic team sport has also beenplayed in Germany and \[4b\] the step to becoming a school sport is imminent.\[5\] Unihoc can be played in the gym as well as outside, on grass or ice.
\[6a\]Because the ball can be played with both sides of the stick, \[6b\] it is mucheasier to master than normal hockey.
\[7\] One can continue playing behindthe goal (four metres up to the board) and \[8\] there is no offside rule.
\[9\]Stopping the ball with the stick and the foot is allowed, as well as playingvia the board.
\[10\] Raising the blade of the stick above knee height, or lifting,hitting, or holding the opponent's stick is not allowed.
\[11\] Entering the goalarea, playing the ball while lying or kneeling, moving the stick between thelegs of the opponent, or engaging in hard body contact is also prohibited.
\[12\]Unihoc allows many alternatives in how it is played.
\[13\] One possibility: \[14\]each team has six players, and no goalie.
\[15a\] In front of the goal there is a no-go area - \[15b\] no players are allowed within a semicircle of almost 2 metersin radius.
\[16\] The second alternative requires more tactical insight: \[17\] herethere are 6 players per team, plus a goalie.
\[18\] Each receives a clear function,which determines their effective playing area.
\[19a\] The two defenders mayonly act within their own half; \[19b\] in contrast, the two attackers may onlyplay within their opponents' half.
\[20\] Only the midfield players can runas they wish over the entire playing field.
\[21\] In this exciting variant soloartists have no chance.
\[22\] Spotting a free team member and passing theball on are essential.
\[23\] Two variants have become dominant.
\[24\] On thelarge field (forty metres long, twenty metres wide) two six-person teams withfixed goalie oppose each other (Playing time: two times twenty minutes).
\[25a\]A board keeps the ball continuously in play; \[25b\] rest periods hardly everoccur.
\[26\] As in ice hockey, a player substituting for another does not leadto an interruption of play (up to eight substitute players per team).
\[27\] Thisis the variant that is used in international matches.
\[28\] The German UnihocUnion (0421/4984255) frequently goes back to the small field variant: \[29\]where mixed 4-person teams play without a goalie.
\[30\] The playing field isonly thirty metres long and sixteen metres wide, while the playing time ishalved.
\[31\] The goals are also smaller than on the large field.
\[32\] The goals(60 x 90 centimeters) are collapsible.
\[33\] In the gym, light holed plastic balls(20 grams, 8 centimeter diameter) are used.
\[34\] The sticks (Kevlar 95 Mark,plastic 10 Mark) are 100 to 120 centimeters in length.
\[35\] Complete sets ofUnihoc equipment cost around 450 Marks.

Independent clauses (or majorinformation units) are numbered for ease of reference and the graphical content of the page isalso summarized.423Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3structed text.
Text spans corresponding to sibling nuclei and satellites are consideredunordered; any ordering in the text is only partial, as given by the RST presentationplan.This is doubly appropriate here because we cannot generally provide a uniquelinear text that re-expresses precisely the information that is given in an original two-dimensional page, and so this is not the constructed text's function here.
The textsimply provides a shorthand for the content hat must necessarily be presumed to un-derlie the page's production.
Moreover, it is necessary in any case to reconstruct theintended content of the page because the page itself is unsuited to stand as the basisfor an RST analysis.
A page's most salient features are visual--i.e., typographical--and part of our claim is that this is not directly indicative of rhetorical organization:relationships between visual blocks on the page are at a different level of abstractionthan rhetorical relations.
Assuming an equivalence of levels would probably lead torhetorical analyses that primarily involve joint schemas conjoining the (many) top-level visual blocks of any page such as the Unihoc page; and at the same time itwould leave the alternations across differing but communicatively similar layouts un-explained.The RST analysis for the constructed Unihoc text, and hence of the page, is shownin Figure 9.
The RST analyses that we use were arrived at following the standard tech-niques of cross-coder checking, consultation and consensus.
The RST diagram followsthe conventions illustrated above in Figure 6 but uses considerably more rhetoricalrelations.
Again, space precludes listing the definitions of the RST relations found inthe analysis, but the definitions employed are exactly as given in the literature.
Theanalysis in the figure also includes the information presented in the original page asphotographs or diagrams.
These have been labeled alphabetically (A, B, etc.)
as iden-tified in Figure 8 and have been anchored into the RST-tree at appropriate places withplausible relations.
4The RST analysis makes our interpretation of the function of the text/page fullyexplicit.
The central nucleus for the page as a whole is unit \[3\], i.e., This mixture ofhockey and ice hockey is attracting ever more supporters.
We are therefore considering theprimary purpose of the page to be a statement that Unihoc is becoming very popular(and so the reader should be well up on it).
The segments immediately followingthe nuclear span, \[5\] and \[6\], give some of the reasons why the sport is becoming sopopular (with rhetorical relation volitional cause), and then segment \[7-11\] gives anoverview of the do's and don'ts of the game.
The main bulk of the constructed textconsists of a concession that, although Unihoc allows many alternatives in how it is played\[12\], two variants have become dominant \[23\].
The existence of alternatives i supportedby the two possibilities presented in segments \[13-15\] and \[16-22\], both related bythe relation evidence to the nuclear \[12\]; the two main alternatives are elaborated in theexplicit contrast drawn in segments \[24-27\] and \[28-31\].
Finally, the segments \[32-36\]and \[37-44\] provide additional elaborating material concerning where and when thegame can be seen and what equipment is necessary to play it.A page such as this presents a considerable challenge for models of automaticlayout.
A closer indication of this complexity is provided by Table 2, which shows thecorrespondence b tween informational segments identified in the RST presentation4 The analysis as shown is not a correct RST structure because it admits differing relations as satellites ofa single nucleus: a strictly correct structure would need to show more intermediate s gments in orderto have one type of relation apply within each segment.
Since this would have complicated thediagram even further, we have simplified for purposes of exposition, although the existence offurtherstructure simplifies the task of the layout-structure construction specification we give below.424Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation..~,~aboration?

The purpose of our empirical investigation was therefore a somewhatdifferent one: we sought to constrain this process of producing layout structures asfar as possible, and to examine whether certain allocations of informational units tolayout units could be ruled out on general principles.4.3 Alternative Renderings of the Constructed Text and their EvaluationIn order to probe the limits of the flexibility suggested above, we next considered alter-native page-layout realizations of the communicative-functional i tent represented inthe rhetorically organized presentation plan.
Our initial hypothesis was that, since theRST analysis represents a statement of the varying degrees of centrality attributed tothe text segments present on the page, then these nuclearity assignments should alsobe reflected in the organization of any page layouts selected.
Concretely, this hypothe-sis means relating text spans to nodes in the layout structure, with the nucleus of anyspan assigning higher weight to its corresponding layout structure node.
This requiresthat the units found in the layout structure correspond only to proper subtrees withinthe RST structure and that elements grouped in the layout also be grouped withinthe RST tree.
We refer to such a layout structure as respecting the "natural divisions"of the RST structure.
Our investigation then evaluated this hypothesis by consideringsuccessively more complex "possible" layouts.426Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation~e~msspor t  un~,o~Ga' r~v~and l~Figure 10(a)event:s: 05...07.5~ D( .

This presentation contains almost no lay-out decisions that subdivide the text into segments or establish relations of similarityand difference among those segments.
The only subdivisions are the heading, text-body, and author divisions; the pictures of the original have been inset into the maintext block approximately where their content is touched upon in the text.
Neverthe-less, this would seem a perfectly possible (if, by current astes, dull) rendering of thematerial to be presented.
It could be appropriate, for example, in an extremely denselypresented lexicon or encyclopedia where space constraints and tradition suppress lay-out variation.
This layout therefore serves to represent one endpoint in a continuumof possible layouts that need to be accommodated in any general account.
It is also afurther illustration of the trade-off between information that is expressed linguisticallythrough explicit textual realization and information that is carried by the layout: ourconstructed Unihoc text needs to do more explicit linguistic signalling of discourse re-lations and communicative function than does the version employing layout.
A readershould be able to recover this information from reading the text but it is not supportedby an explicit layout encoding; we return to this issue below.We consider this case to emphasize that layout is concerned with choice.
This isvery similar to the state of a fairs in NLG: the main principle is that a speaker/writerhas to choose how to present information and, whenever there is choice, there is meaning:that is, the choice is not free and some choices will be more appropriate than othersin particular contexts.
Moreover, the layout decomposition that is selected should bein some way coherent with respect o the communicative functions of the page.
Thenext example layout, shown in Figure 10(b), illustrates this by presenting a layout427Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3i T 'iiJFigure 11Example of a "non-natural" division of an RST structure.in which choices, we would argue, have not been made coherently.
The unmotivateddecisions that make this layout incomprehensible include: the Unihoc variants sectionbreaks down into two parts of differing visual appearance; additional information(events) becomes excessively important due to its prominent position and font size;and the information about he author is related only to the first textblock and not to theentire article.
Such problems are identical to those arising in the NLG task: when moreflexibility of expression/presentation is made available---for example, by consideringgeneration with respect o a grammar with broader coverage--it s essential to controlthis flexibility appropriately in order to avoid wrong decisions.The problematic nature of the layout of Figure 10(b) can be succinctly stated: itviolates our initial hypothesis concerning the desired correspondence b tween RSTstructure and layout structure: the constituency structure of the layout and that of theRST tree are in direct opposition at several points.
For example, there is no distinc-tion drawn in type face between page elements introducing the game and describingthe rules (which are relatively more nuclear), and elements describing some of thevariants, whereas other variants are presented as a separate lement with a larger,more prominent ype face; these decisions are not, therefore, motivatable on the basisof the RST structure.
Most serious, however, is the way in which the division intotwo elements describing the game variants has been done: these elements involvesegments which do not correspond to RST-subtrees at all.
Indeed, the second segment(corresponding to \[19a\]-\[22\] in the RST tree) goes further and breaks the RST structureat two points: segment \[19a\]-\[20\] is related by elaboration to unit \[18\] while segment\[21\]-\[22\] is related, also by elaboration, to unit \[16\].
The combined segment, \[19a\]-\[22\],is therefore composed of two completely disjoint and unrelated parts of the RST tree;we show this graphically in Figure 11.
In general, such layout structures are indeedfound to be difficult to interpret coherently (cf., Schriver \[1996\]).The simplest strategy for producing an appropriate layout is therefore to restrictlayout decomposition and constituency to the "natural divisions" established in theRST analysis.
Any subtree is then, at least in principle, a candidate for selection as alayout unit.
Accordingly, we suggest hat the constructed layout shown in Figure 12does fulfill the tasks of rendering the communicative intentions of the original pagequite well.
A relatively large number of layout decisions have been taken--for instance,the most important statements form a block of their own at the top of the page,additional peripheral information is placed in a vertical gray margin bar, and the maintext is divided in two sections: The rules and Unihoc variants.
Despite this diversity, thepage remains coherent by virtue of the congruence of its layout structure with the RSTstructure; this is summarized in Table 3.While this rendering of the RST structure is perhaps acceptable as a simple layout,we must observe that it still does not approach the complexity and diversity of the428Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generationwedes i~ is t te  mo~ popular and besr4~ownxr-  We a-e ta!

Therefore, while conformance to the RST structure may prove itself a necessary(or at least, very desirable) condition, it is by no means ufficient for the construc-tion of appropriate layouts.
The layout decisions taken in the original Unihoc pageincluded both significantly more variety in the layout and typeface resources allo-cated, and a greater degree of decomposition.
Moreover, although most of the designdecisions appear coherent with respect o the notion of natural division developedso far, it is not the case that all of the layout decompositions are covered--in fact,rather more decompositions and discriminations are being made.
This is shown graph-429Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3Figure 13Correspondence b tween layout units and rhetorical structure in the original page.
All of theblocks shown end up as siblings in the top-level layout structure because they are all visuallyquite distinct and variably moveable: they adopt differing typefaces, have no common left orright margins, are more or less evenly distributed over the page, etc.ically in Figure 13 where the layout decomposition is explicitly contrasted with theRST structure; here we can see that, although the decomposition generally respectsRST subtrees, it is not the case that we can transparently map this to a correspondingrecursive layout structure.
This rather common situation led us to accept hat render-ing the information in an RST-structure is not a simple decomposition, but is itselfa planned activity.
Information is taken from the RST-structure for various purposesand, as a consequence, both differing degrees of detail and varying decompositionsmust be supported.5.
Towards Automatic Page Layout: An Algorithm for Communicatively MotivatedLayoutWe have shown that an RST-analysis of the desired content for a page can be used toargue that a layout structure is more, or less, appropriate, and can indicate possiblepoints of decomposition i to layout units.
We now go one step further and set outa procedure for the mapping of RST-style presentation plans into layout structures.Mapping is generally achieved by placing parts of the RST-structure in correspondencewith particular nodes in a layout structure.
This proceeds recursively down throughthe RST tree.
As we have now seen, however, the correspondence is complicated bythe fact the layout structure and the RST tree need not remain congruent.430Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page GenerationWe divide the mapping procedure into a core component, which supports the fullrange of layout options that appear possible given our corpus tudy, and a set of furtherheuristics that guide the translation process in particular cases.
Most of the heuristicsare concerned with the question of whether decomposition f the RST structure shouldstop at some point or continue to produce amore specific layout structure.
In contrast,the core component is straightforward--mostly because the layouts observed exhibitsuch flexibility that few hard constraints seem to apply.5.1 Core Translation Procedure: Recursive DescentAt any point in an RST structure, we can consider the correspondence b tween theRST subtree descending from that point and an appropriate layout structure.
Thetranslation procedure assumes trong locality in that, when decomposing a subtree,it does not look outside of that tree to make its decisions.
As the layout structure isconstructed, layout units can be either open, in which case they are still acceptingadditional material from the RST structure as recursive descent continues, or closed,in which case the extent of their content has been fixed.
Translation begins by positinga single layout unit that will hold all of the content of the RST-subtree, and a single,at that point empty, open descendant layout unit.
If the mapping process decides thatthere is no need for any further layout decomposition--as in a monomodal, traditionalNLG environment with neither graphics nor headings--then the open layout unitis closed off containing the entire RST tree being considered.
This content (and itsrhetorical organization) would then be passed off to the natural anguage generatorin the usual way.In most documents, however, layout decomposition occurs, and so the layoutstructure has to be grown further.
This is achieved by partitioning the set of RST-structure segments available at the current level of RST structure (segments are indi-cated in RST diagrams by the horizontal lines: cf., Figures 6 and 9) into those that areto be accepted into the current layout unit and those that are not.
When any segmentis not accepted, the RST relational link is cut at that point, the accepted segments areadded to the current layout unit (which remains open), and the cut segment is addedto a new, closed layout unit inserted parallel to the original ayout unit.
The acceptedpartition must include at least the nucleus at that level of RST structure; this meansthat it is not possible to include satellites in the current layout unit and then excludethe nucleus--this would correspond to the unnatural division shown in Figure 11above.
Crucially, it is quite possible for all of the segments to be accepted and forrecursive descent o continue without having closed the current layout unit.
Both closedand open layout units are then further developed according to the recursive structureof their respective RST segments.When a decision is made to cut an RST link, and the segments to be partitionedbelong to a multinuclear relation or joint schema, then all the related segments areextracted and associated with sibling layout units.
The layout units thus introducedare also annotated with type-equivalence links, while reference annotations are addedbetween pictures and text within single RST-structure segments.
The weight annota-tions are allocated in direct proportion to the nucleus and satellite distinctions: thenucleus receives the highest weight, with the remaining distributed over the satellites(see Section 3).
We have not yet been able to explore appropriate weightings in anysophisticated manner, and so their effect on alternative layouts remains a subject forfurther investigation.In summary, the process of recursive descent of the RST tree can be seen broadlyas one of deciding where to break RST links.
Breaking a link (either a span-to-nucleuslink or a nucleus-to-satellite link) causes the material thus separated from the tree431Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3A If-B Crecursive descent/~ .--- t.o(1) initial..... ~"'"I" (2) statelayout structure state ~ ?

Material that is not separated in this way remains part of the informationcontent o be expressed by the current layout unit.
This means that RST subtreesrelated hierarchically in the RST tree may be assigned to sibling layout units.
Theprocess is shown graphically in Figure 14.This can therefore lead to a significant loss of structure resulting from the factthat the dominance relations holding in the RST structure are not maintained in thelayout structure.
The core translation procedure thus results in a steady reductionin the complexity of the structure being constructed compared to the RST structurefrom which it derives.
In the Unihoc original page, this is the situation with the seg-ment \[12-22\] (Unihoc variants): this satellite is broken out of its potential embeddingwithin the dominating segment \[1-6\]+\[12-31\] and appears instead as a layout siblingof the remaining Intro unit that realizes \[1-6\]+\[23-31\].
This action has two commonconsequences: first, the layout weight of the broken-out unit is reduced and, second,the fact that a layout unit has been severed from its functionally motivated parent(i.e., the nucleus) appears in many text types sufficient grounds for introducing afurther layout unit that has the task of explicitly signalling what the relation was.This additional layout unit appears as a header or title (e.g., the AIIe Formen sindm?~glich--(all forms are possible--of the original page).
A header is then the layoutequivalent of a discourse marker.
However, since headers cannot ypically functionas relationally as discourse markers (because they cannot readily point back to theirpoint of origin), they tend instead to give sufficient information for the reader to makea connection--for example, by summarizing the nucleus of their segments.
While wecurrently attribute the reduction in layout weight to the core translation, the provi-sion of headers again appears to be a genre-specific concern and so we keep this as aheuristic.Removing structure can, if unconstrained, lead to some very undesirable layouts:for example, we could take the entire RST structure of the Unihoc constructed textapart from the last satellite of the Equipment subtree to produce two parallel ayoutunits: the rest of the text and the fact that one can get information about the Equip-ment by telephoning the given number.
Our translation process partially avoids thissituation by employing media-allocation (i.e., whether layout units are to be realizedtextually, graphically, pictorially, etc.)
to force partitions whenever there is a difference432Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generationin medium.
For example, if one segment of a partition is to be realized as a photo-graph and another as a textblock, then it is not possible to accept both of these into theopen layout unit.
This is motivated by the fact that we do not have a means of com-bining the content of photographs and text other than by allocating them to distinctlayout units and positioning them in appropriate proximity; we return to the issue ofmedia allocation below.
The rule serves to avoid insignificant satellites being givinga prominent layout status by increasing the likelihood that prior decomposition willhave already taken place.Moreover, we have observed two further forces that restrict objectionable ayoutsof this kind: first, whenever a collection of layout units are constructed as siblings,their relative weights need to be ascertained--the further down (vertically and interms of nucleus-satellite status) in the RST structure, the lower relative weight anassociated layout unit receives.
6 Second, we add a heuristic that disprefers isolatingrelatively insignificant satellites that lack substantial substructure of their own.
Thestrength of this heuristic appears to vary significantly according to the genre of theinformation being presented: for example, newspapers now appear to be considerablymore willing to promote lower subtrees to the status of layout siblings than are thepages that were the subject of our empirical investigation.
We will return to this aspectof layout variation in the conclusion.Finally, although we cannot pursue this theme further here, the gradual reduc-tion in structural complexity proposed has several suggestive similarities with whathappens when monomodal, linear text is produced from an underlying RST-like struc-ture.
There too, structural complexity is replaced by explicit linguistic oding operatinglinearly from one clause or utterance to the next.
The linguistic encoding must givesufficient clues for a reader/hearer to make an attempt at recovering the intendedstructure, but does not itself appear to exhibit that structure.
In this respect, one-dimensional text and two-dimensional layout may not be as different as might havebeen thought.5.2 Layout Units and Layout Forms: Bottoming OutWhen the decision has been made not to continue decomposition of an RST subtreeinto further layout units, the entire content associated with the subtree, as well as itsrhetorical organization, is placed in correspondence with a terminal layout unit.
Thatlayout unit is then allocated a layout form.
Layout forms can be either graphical (e.g.,diagram, photograph, etc.
), or textual.
Examples of textual layout forms are textblocksconsisting of paragraphs, enumerated lists, itemized lists, and the like.
The broadchoice between graphical and textual ayout forms is made by the media-allocationdecision described below.Significantly, some textual ayout forms have substructure of their own.
We con-sider them complex forms within a single layout unit (rather than conjoined layoutunits), because they appear to have rather limited scope for independently flexiblelayout within their enclosing layout units--it is unusual to format distinct elementsin an enumerated list with different ype families, type sizes, or colors, etc.
When alayout form requires further structure, we talk of layout elements extending the orig-6 This may even occur in the Unihoc page.
On the righthand edge towards the bottom there is a verysmall piece of text citing the source of the photographs.
Since this information can be seen aselaborations of the photographs, we have an example of a situation where avery insignificant segment(for the content) isbroken out and given its own layout unit.
The consequence is, predictably, that itreceives very little visual weight.433Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3Table 4Distribution of information to layout elements within a layout unit, depending on theselection of layout form.RST configuration rendered in layout unit~elementspan\[32-36\] "Njoint(\[32\],\[33\],\[34\]) "Nenablement(\[35\],\[36\]) "Nlayout form: itemized-listitemization: by number\[32\] "N numbered item\[33\] "N numbered item\[34\] "N numbered itemlist-trailer\[36\] "N trailerinal layout structure downwards: for example, the textual layout form itemized listintroduces layout elements for each of its items.
We have considered modeling this intwo ways: first, by allowing the textual ayout-form textblock to include formattingsimilar to that provided in HTML or  I~TEX; 7 and, second, by simply allowing the RST-to-layout ranslation process to recurse further with a restricted range of allowablelayout forms.While the first approach is straightforward to implement and is closer to exist-ing approaches to punctuation and formatting in NLG (Sefton 1990; Hovy and Arens1991; White 1995; Pascual 1996), the latter appears to offer more scope for investigatingthe trade-offs between layout and linguistic realization mentioned above.
It may alsoprove necessary for more aggressively graphical documents hat include traditionallygraphical elements (e.g., pictures, icons, etc.)
within the confines of traditionally tex-tual elements (e.g., items in itemized lists).
A textual layout form is still most often,however, a site of relative textual stability and will generally enforce linguistic andlayout (e.g., style, punctuation) uniformity on the content hat is expressed: for ex-ample, rendering all items of a list as nominal phrases, verb phrases, sentences, etc.,as considered appropriate.
This occurs in several places within the Unihoc page: inthe case of the Equipment segment, for example, we have the correspondences indi-cated in Table 4.
The Events segment is similar, with enumeration by date followedby a textblock as the enumeration trailer.
In both cases, typographical constraints areselected for the overall layout unit and these are then enforced for each constituentlayout element.At present, we consider the motivations for distinct textual forms only verystraightforwardly: if there are diverse RST relations present in the content correspond-ing to a layout unit, then we favor generating running text for that content; if thereis a strong multinuclear RST organization (as, in the present example, the sequenceseen in \[37-44\] or the joints in \[7-11\]), then we favor an itemized list of some kind.Exhaustive presentation combined with strict sequencing leads us to favor an enu-meration; less exhaustivity or lack of strict sequencing moves us through bulleted liststo simple sequences of offset paragraphs.
These heuristics are currently enforced bysimple calculations concerning depth of RST relation, ratio of relation types to numberof segments, etc.7 This would appear to correspond closely to the level of representation called a DocRep (DocumentRepresentation) in the reference model for generation architectures that have been proposed within theRAGS project (RAGS Project 1999).434Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation5.3 Media AllocationDuring the construction of layout structure, the translation process attempts to de-termine appropriate media allocations for the layout units introduced.
Although, ingeneral, this needs to be a motivated selection of presentation mode using criteriasuch as those discussed by Arens and Hovy (1990), Arens, Hovy, and Vossers (1993),Feiner and McKeown (1993), and others, for our current purposes we have restrictedthis decision to information that can be gained from a dependency-lattice analysisof the information content associated with segments from the RST tree.
Thus, whenconsidering the partition of segments at some point in the recursive descent throughthe RST tree, the translation process requests a dependency lattice for each segmentand, depending on the result, assigns a likely medium choice.
The currently possibleallocations are diagram, photo, text, and complex.
The main choice, however, is be-tween diagram and text; the photo option is self-selecting--i.e., if information is onlyavailable as a picture then that is what will be slotted into the layout structure, andthe complex option is selected whenever there are self-selecting segments deeper inthe RST subtree being considered.The heuristic that we employ for allocation assumes that the more simultaneousdimensions of regularity are present, the more likely it is that a diagram will bethe more perspicuous representation.
The rationale for this can be readily seen fromthe suggested text version of the diagrams in Figure 4.
The text version does notread fluently precisely because it struggles to express imultaneously the co-varyingdimensions of school, profession and time period.
The fact that there are so many co-varying dimensions i , however, readily available from the dependency lattice: whena dataset has extensive and simultaneous regularities then these are present as nodesin the lattice.
Thus, when there are co-varying dimensions of potential aggregation, amedium allocation of diagram is made, when not, text is selected.
These allocationsare then employed in the decision of whether to cut an RST relational link as describedabove.The dependency lattices used for media selection are maintained as additionalinformation that is drawn on during both natural language and diagram generation.Moreover, and depending on the rhetorical relation, there can be co-ordination suchthat a satellite must re-use the dependency lattice already calculated for its nucleus.This is shown concretely in our DArtbio discussion below.5.4 The Unihoc PagesWith the translation process described so far, we can come close to producing arealisticlayout structure for the Unihoc RST structure.
Beginning at the top of the RST structurein Figure 9, our first set of segments o partition is {\[A+0\], [1--44\]}: both have a complexmedium allocation and so we cut the RST structure at this point.
The satellite \[A+0\]is associated with a closed layout unit and the nucleus \[1--44\] with a sibling openunit.
Whereas both segments have further ecursive structure, their treatment is nowdifferent: because the satellite unit is closed, its rhetorical substructure now contributesto embedded layout units (i.e., the process recurses here); in contrast, the nucleus unitis open, which means that its rhetorical structure may still contribute top-level siblinglayout units.
And this is what happens.
The next set of segments to be partitionedis {\[1\], \[2\], \[3-4\], \[5+D,E\], \[6\], \[7-11\], \[12-31\], \[32-36\], \[37-44\]}; the nucleus is \[3-4\] and so the decision concerns which satellites, if any, are to be grouped with thenucleus and which are not.
Our heuristic concerning regular substructure (ratio ofrelation types to segments) picks out \[5\], \[7-11\], \[32-36\] and \[37-44\] as good candidatesfor their own layout units; moreover, the units \[5\] and \[32-36\] are also complex byvirtue of the fact that tbey include photographs.
This leaves the segments {\[1\], \[2\],435Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3~ \[i'-8\]+\[23-31\]j .

The process continues in this fashion, eventuallyadding all of the material under \[3-4\] to the open unit, as well as the nucleus of \[12-31\].
The satellite of \[12-31\] is cut, however, and is therefore added as a closed layoutunit.
Note that since we are still adding material to the original open layout unit, thislatter satellite also ends up as a top-level sibling.
An indication of the entire layoutstructure of the original page is shown in Figure 15.
In addition to the constituencyrelationships we have discussed so far, the layout structure includes reference linksintroduced between pictures and text related within single RST structure segments, aswell as equivalence links introduced between units associated with members of RSTjoint schemas.When rendered as a page, the layout structure does not indicate any type-equiva-lence links between the top level units; so, apart from the prominence that should beaccorded to the main-line, nuclear textblock, there is no clear relationship of similaritybetween any of the remaining decomposed units.
We can therefore xpect either thesame form to be used for all of them (for a "quieter" page layout) or differing formsto be used for each (for a "louder" page layout).
8 Probably unsurprisingly, givenits intended audience and function, the page as published adopts the latter option,yielding the diversity that we saw displayed in Table 2.The same RST structure also stands as a starting point for the production of lay-out structures corresponding to the alternative layouts hown in Figures 10(a) and 12above--although some questions are raised concerning the adequacy of our proposed"simplest" layout in Figure 10(a).
To produce the simplest layout, we simply refuse tocut any RST relational links until the occurrence of a photograph or a diagram forcesus to.
This yields one layout unit for the photograph of the author and associated text,one layout unit for the rest of the text (with a 2-column textblock layout form), and8 Thanks to Judy Delin for suggesting the volume control metaphor.436Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generationlayout units for the remaining photographs and diagrams.
However, given our RSTanalysis, it is then impossible to motivate the disappearance of the equipment callouts because the photograph is nuclear.
This may either indicate that the RST analysisis incorrect at this point or, more likely, that the layout is not a faithful representation.In fact, just distributing pictures liberally around the page does not appear to yield aneffective layout, and thus, this "simplest" rendering is in fact too simple: it no longercommunicates the intended meaning; either the picture of the equipment has to go,or the individual equipment descriptions have to be reinstated.
This is done in Fig-ure 12, where the layout divisions are similar to the original page, with two importantexceptions: first, the RST segments \[1-6\] are maintained as a single layout unit with asubstructure consisting of one textblock and the two photographs as referring siblinglayout units; 9second, the RST segment \[12-31\] is maintained as a single layout unitwithout further decomposition.
Finally, it should also be clear why the unacceptablelayout shown in Figure 10(b) cannot be produced according to the translation pro-cedure we have described since; for example, it is not possible to accumulate suchwildly displaced segments of the RST tree into single layout units.5.5 Interim ConclusionThis section has set out a procedure for producing layout structures from rhetoricalstructures.
However, the mapping remains highly nondeterministic.
Further sourcesof constraint will be required before it will be possible to let the procedure simply runand produce layouts.
Part of this indeterminacy lies in the fact that many fine-graineddecisions in the microtypography of real publications (e.g., what typeface to select,whether text in a layout unit is typeset ragged or justified, etc.)
are not motivatedby the communicative-functional intentions as captured by the RST-analysis of singletexts, but are instead fixed by higher level decisions concerning a magazine's intendedstyle and feel (cf., Reichenberger t al.
\[1996\] and the conclusion below for furtherdiscussion).
Another part of the indeterminacy arises out of the fact that layout isgenuinely very flexible.
Considerably more investigation will be required before theparameters and limits of that flexibility are charted.
Nevertheless, armed with this firstmapping specification, we now turn to a particular application to see how it functionswith rather simpler tasks than the world of Unihoc pages.6.
Page Generation within the Prototype Information SystemThe application scenario described in this section was a natural outgrowth of theEditor's Workbench (see Section 2.1), moving from its original conception as a toolfor editors, to take on more of a role of an information system for general use.
Priorinterface-design studies investigating beneficial applications ofthe Editor's Workbenchsuggested a usage scenario in which the information system provides "overinforma-tive" responses to information retrieval requests.
In this scenario, the user is assumedto be browsing rather than posing focused queries.
The overinformative r sponseavoids burdening the user with unwanted ata by presenting the information as acoherently organized multimodal page: the user can quickly scan the information onoffer in the same way as he or she would scan a newspaper or magazine page.
Forthis to be effective, the layout must correctly communicate which information is cen-tral and which information is more peripheral--i.e., it must signal the communicative9 This is in fact he layout structure shown in Figure 5 above; nodes 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, and 2.3.4 in thefigure correspond to the RST spans \[1-6\], [12-31\]--D and E, respectively.437Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3intentions of the page as a whole.
The resulting DArtbi0 system aimed specifically atproviding pages that present artists' biographical information: the Editor's Workbenchdomain model had already accumulated information of this kind for several thousandartists and so offered a solid basis for prototype construction.
Finally, for somethingof a local connection, we concentrated on the Bauhaus.There are many aspects of the design and implementation of the complete DArtbiosystem that space precludes us giving here.
Moreover, the system remains an initialtestbed for our approach--many considerations crucial for a practical system havenot been addressed.
Our focus centers on just those aspects relevant for our claimsconcerning layout and the mechanisms by which it is realized--and even here thepresentation will sometimes need to be schematic.
The central components that arerelevant are the automatic visualization engine (AVE: Section 2.1 and Kamps \[1998\]),the automatic page-layout component (APALO: Section 3), the natural anguage gen-erator (KOMET: Bateman and Teich \[1995\] and Bateman, Teich, and Alexa \[1998\]), andthe very large domain model (ca.
500,000 objects) of the Editor's Workbench (Rostek,M6hr, and Fischer 1994).
The slice through the system that we describe lies betweenthe goal-driven establishment of a rhetorically structured presentation plan on theone hand, and the construction of a fully specified layout structure on the other.
Toachieve this transformation we apply the general mapping procedure described in theprevious ection augmented by application-specific decision heuristics.
As with mostmultimodal information systems, the terminal elements of our layout structure receiveparticular media allocations that determine the means employed for their production;but, in contrast o previous systems, we detail the new role played by dependencylattices in both media-allocation and media-coordination a d then some of the conse-quences of adopting a flexible rhetorical structure to layout-structure mapping.6.1 Abstract Page SpecificationWe begin by setting up some closely related presentation plans.
Our examples revolvearound possible answers to questions art historians typically ask in discussing thespread of art movements: for example, How did the Bauhaus pread to the United States?The interaction style supported by the Editor's Workbench--and hence by its furtherincarnation as DArtbio--is described in Kamps et al (1996); users explore the databaseprogressively by following proposed links.
Asking for information about the Bauhausretrieves, amongst other objects, the set of all artists classified as Bauhaus artists.
TheWorkbench also includes preset question types for distinct ypes of object; these ques-tion types were established through consultation with editors expert in the domain.One such question for the object ype art movement is spread of influence.
The domainknowledge representation for art history includes a range of conditions that are knownto contribute to a spread of influence: for example, artists moving to the country be-ing influenced.
Following the link spread of influence and cross-classifying this against acountry, such as U.S.A., then restricts the former set of Bauhaus artists down to thosethat are known to the system to have moved to the U.S.
This information then needsto be presented to the user.At this point, DArtbio must construct presentation plans.
Presentation plans arecomposed by appealing to knowledge of how particular kinds of texts are structured.For example, biographies as a text type, or genre, have certain regularly reoccuringfeatures of organization and content.
The NLG component of the system, KOMET, isstrongly genre-based: generation proceeds first and foremost by receiving a request ogenerate a text belonging to a specific genre, e.g., a biography.
The linguistic details ofthe texts required are established by prior corpus studies.
This use of genre as a pre-structuring device for texts resembles schemas as introduced into NLG by McKeown438Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation1-10L... Summary: varyingi.

The biographies are filled in the same way as the biography thatis shown, following the linguistic genre constraints for biographies.
The summary is filled inusing a dependency lattice for information extraction.
(1985), but is grounded linguistically more in notions of generic text structure (Hasan1996); there is also a clear relationship to domain communication knowledge (Kit-tredge, Korelsky, and Rambow 1991).
We extended this genre-based view to includeall of the information offerings of the DArtbio system.
Presentation plans therefore be-gin their life as partially specified generic structures, defined as incomplete rhetoricalstructures.We consider two styles of presentation arising from this scenario: in the first, theuser is simply presented with information about the list of selected artists; in thesecond, the information focuses more on the movement of those artists to the U.S.Both presentations use a common generic presentation style and were motivated byuser/editor consultations within the earlier phases of the Dictionary of Art project--the main information content of the communicative move is allocated to the nucleusof a summary rhetorical structure.
The initial presentation plan is then grown furtherby recursive descent.
The contents of the satellite are filled in according to the def-inition of summary as given below.
The contents of the nucleus were provided bythe information-retrieval request--in our first presentation plan, this is a set of artistscombined by a joint rhetorical schema.
Each of these is then expanded further: sincethe default presentational style adopted for an artist within DArtbio is the biographygenre, the NLG component constructs a rhetorical fragment conforming to the struc-ture of this text type, collecting information from the domain model as required.
Theparticular model of biography adopted here also includes the use of a photograph ifthe Editor's Workbench domain model includes one for the artist in question.This results in a presentation plan of the form shown in Figure 16.
While all ofthe biographies are filled in in the same way, employing standard NLG-techniques,the summary is more interesting.
DArtbio distinguishes between two subtypes of sum-mary: a summary giving an overview of shared properties with varying attributes(summary-varying), and a summary giving an overview of shared properties only(summary-shared).
In the current presentation plan, the former is used.
Our approachto summaries relies heavily on the dependency lattice-mechanism; regularities are as-439Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3sumed to provide useful summaries of the data being presented.
The informationcontent of the summary is therefore produced by constructing a dependency-latticeof the information to be summarized--i.e., the list of propositions contained in thenucleus--and picking out regularities (i.e., nodes higher in the lattice).
1?
Performingthis for the information in the biographies picks out and partially orders the informa-tion that recurs: i.e., name, date and place of birth and death, and profession (whichalways occur), and then certain contingent aspects of education and career dependingon the particular artists selected.
The highest scoring facts are selected for inclusionin the summary (which may either occur immediately by some preset cut-off point or,more interestingly, be left for later when space constraints may determine how muchinformation to give).
This set of information is not organized further rhetorically.6.2 Determining Page LayoutIf, for the sake of concreteness, we now assume that the user has restricted his or herattention to a selection of just five artists: Gropius, Hilberseimer, Anni Albers, JosefAlbers, and Breuer--again we emphasize that the names and information presentedhere are for illustrative purposes only--we can apply the layout mechanism of the pre-vious section to the presentation plan in order to produce a corresponding page.
Thepresentation plan is much simpler than the Unihoc case and so the options are some-what more restricted.
Beginning at the top of the plan, we may either decompose theplan or not.
We consider the media allocations for the possible partitions, which areinitially comprised of the nucleus to the summary as well as the satellite.
The nucleuscan only be allocated a complex medium-status ( ince it is structurally complex andincludes subtrees with pictorial content), while the satellite can be allocated eithertext or diagram status.
Given this choice, DArtbio selects diagram as preferable onthe grounds discussed above.
The members of the partition therefore receive differentmedia-allocations and so a layout decomposition is introduced.
The summary-satelliteis a leaf of the presentation plan and so there is no further layout decomposition tobe considered.
The layout element is allocated a diagram-layout form and the contentis passed on directly to the visualization component for diagram generation.Layout decomposition then proceeds with the nucleus, which consists of the jointschema.
The decision is whether to stop decomposition at this point or whether tocontinue.
Each member of the joint schema still has a complex medium-status andso our heuristics favor decomposition.
The core layout mechanism does not allow usto break just one member of a multinuclear configuration off from the presentationplan and thus all the sibling biographies must be taken.
This introduces a furtherfive layout elements into the layout structure, each corresponding to a biography.Moreover, these five are linked by equivalence annotations and, because they arenuclear in the presentation plan, their combined weight must remain greater than thatof the diagram.
Since subtrees have now been cut from the presentation plan, the layoutmechanism also has the option of introducing additional layout elements as headers.In the DArtbio case, we set up our heuristics, rather arbitrarily, to give headers totextblocks only; a more realistic decision-making process here can only be constructedafter considerably more empirical investigation.
Thus, since the individual biographylayout units are still complex, we do not immediately construct a header element butpass this option down so that it may be picked up by the first nuclear textblock that10 Other, more sophisticated approaches tosummarization can, of course, be considered; moreover, it maynot be necessary to consider all of the propositions in the nucleus.
RST suggests that only nuclei needbe considered, while Cristea, Ide, and Romary (1998) refine this further and suggest that some nucleiplus a specified set of their satellites (those that are vein heads) is preferable.440Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generationf I. .

diagram fortype-equivalent layout units for the biographies summaryFigure 17Partial layout structure following decomposition f the presentation plan according tosummary and biographies.is encountered.
The state of the layout structure following these decisions is showngraphically in Figure 17.The constraints on layout and presentation that are being accumulated in the lay-out structure now begin to bite, restricting possibilities for further layout-structure d -velopment.
First, as specified by the layout mechanism, when the visualization engineattempts to design a diagram, it must construct a dependency lattice for the informa-tion that is to be expressed.
It is now constrained, however, to taking the dependencylattice that has already been constructed for the nucleus to which the summary is con-nected.
This guarantees that the grouping and graphical-attribute allocations deployedin the diagram will be consistent with the regularities observable in the informationpresented in the set of biographies.
Second, when the layout structure is decomposedfurther, the equivalence r lation will require that the same layout decisions be made forall the biographies.
This then guarantees that regardless of precise physical placement,the typographical message will be that these biographies have the same status.Decomposition of the biography layout units is straightforward.
The only partitionis in terms of the photograph and the biographical information: the medium-allocationof the photograph is self-selecting, and that of the biographical information is text be-cause of the few co-varying dimensions of information revealed by the dependencylattice.
Therefore, the layout unit is decomposed, and the picture receives a refers tolink.
The remaining biographical information can either be grouped within anothersingle layout unit, or decomposed further.
Our heuristics do not bother to decomposewhen there is little content o be expressed; and as each of the satellites in the biogra-phy contains only a few propositions (rarely more than four with most artists in theEditor's Workbench knowledge base), we do not decompose further here, selecting asingle layout unit with a textblock layout form.
However, since we have the option ofinserting a header layout element from above, we discharge this here, giving a layoutstructure as shown to the left of Figure 18.
A page-rendering solution for this struc-ture is shown in the upper right of the figure: layout elements have been mapped torectangles with particular dimensions and locations on the page.
The contents of thelayout elements are produced according to the layout forms allocated: the picture issimply inserted (with an appropriate scaling for the layout unit as a whole); a text isgenerated by the NLG component (conforming to the generic text constraints of bi-ographies); and a header is selected (a domain-specific process).
When these contentsare filled in, the results is page fragments uch as that shown in the lower right of thefigure.
Similar solutions are provided for all of the biographies because of the specifiedtype-equivalence.441Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3b io  ,, I54w:70~mer ic~n,  and he was an~: ia l  designer 8nd a teacher,~flih~on 1~) Msy 1883, and he~'5 July 1989, He t rsined 8t thein 190El.

An exam-ple of a complete generated page that renders the layout structure is shown in Fig-ure 19.
The individual biographies are each as described above; we can see that thegeneric onstraint that a photograph of the artist be presented has not been satisfiedin all cases, but this does not affect the general ayout forms applied to the set asa whole.
More significantly, the regularities expressed in the diagram are preciselythe regularities that are expressed in the text parts of the biographies.
The diagrampicks out artists as the basic graphical elements and allocates to these elements at-tributes of color (for profession) and extent (for lifespan).
In addition, time and placeof birth and death are added as icon graphical attributes, again color coded.
Confor-mity and consistency in design has therefore been achieved for the page as a wholeeven when there are minor deviations in available information in some of the pageelements.The layout process is very flexible in terms of the solutions that it pursues.
Theapparent resemblance of the page to a grid-based layout is in fact simply a by-productof the constraint-resolution process and its attempt o fit 7 boxes (the 5 biographylayout units, the diagram, and the diagram's key) into a limited space.
For compari-son, some other solutions offered by the layout process are shown in the alternativethumbnail ayouts of Figure 20.
These give a graphical sense of the notion of layoutunit: we can see that layout units are maintained as persistent visual groupings re-gardless of their precise placement.
Since all of the top-level layout units are siblingsin the layout structure, the layout process must also work to avoid suggesting anygrouping among them.
This is achieved by spreading the units evenly over the pageas a whole.The co-ordination of text, diagram, and layout demonstrated in the Figure 19can be further illustrated very briefly by considering our second presentation plan:442Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generationmc~ ~ ~e; - I~ c z  ~bc: .

There is, however, less information under the main nucleus, asthere are no longer full biographies to generate but rather text elements of the form:Albers settled in the USA in 1933.
In 1933-1949 she taught at BlackMountain College in North Carolina.These may be allocated either to distinct layout units as in the previous examplewhich would distribute them about the page as shown--or to a single layout unitas a textblock, in which case the aggregations illustrated in Section 2.2 apply.
When,however, the summary is produced, the visualization component receives a very dif-ferent dependency lattice than that used for the diagram in the previous example, onethat is almost identical to that used as an example in Section 2.1 above.
The diagramproduced in this case is therefore also quite different and focuses instead on the reg-ularities of teaching (i.e., profession, workperiod, and school), as shown in Figure 4.The text and diagram are therefore again appropriately coordinated.6.4 SummaryThe DArtbio prototype can produce similar pages to the one shown in Figure 19 forany set of artists selected by the user in the course of interaction with the system.
Thepresentation environment is implemented in Smalltalk, the visualization and layoutengines in C, and the text generation component in Common Lisp; page generation isin real-time.
The overanswering present in any page is balanced by the use of a pageto set out the information in a way that does not commit he user to reading it all.The layout process is flexible within the limits that are compatible with the goal ofpresenting a fixed amount of information on a page, but would require substantiallymore work to be sufficiently robust for a real-world system.
The question of evalua-tion has not, therefore, been relevant: sufficiently fine-grained heuristics are in placeto prevent layout disasters, but considerably more empirical work is now requiredin order to generalize these heuristics across differing domains and iffering targetdocument types.7.
Conclusions and OutlookIn this paper we have argued that many of the decisions that need to be made foran effective diagram are also found in the construction of an effective text.
Makingboth sets of decisions dependent on a single, shared representation f regularities ina dataset provides a straightforward way of achieving consistency in the perspec-444Bateman, Karnps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generationtives presented in the differing media: diagrams and texts then mutually reinforceone another by applying common information groupings.
We have also argued thata message is provided by the physical layout of information on a page: relationsof similarity, difference, and connection are commonly expressed by layout.
In de-signing a page, therefore, layout relations must be made consistent with the overallcommunicative intent of the page.
We have shown how consistency between layoutand communicative intent can be achieved by deriving the former (layout structure)from a representation f the latter (rhetorically organized presentation plan).
We havediscussed both how such a derivation can be motivated and how it can be used forautomatic page generation.Our study of the relationship between the communicative structure of a page of in-formation and the coherent layout of that information demonstrates that layout needsto be treated as an integral and complex part of the overall generation process; it can inno way be treated as a final piece of postprocessing.
Many of the decisions required forsegmenting a text effectively (e.g., into thematic paragraphs, into rhetorically relatedsegments, etc.)
also have correlates in the decisions that produce a coherent layoutstructure.
This entails several areas of trade-off between layout and text: segmentationand grouping information may be expressed in language, in layout, or in some mixtureof the two.
By treating language xpressions and layout as arising ultimately from acommon source, we expect hat potentially costly constraint-resolution at a local level(i.e., between arbitrary segments) can be avoided, or reduced, by enforcing consistentlayout-language d cisions for the layout structure of a page as a whole.The last five years have seen rapid growth in the awareness of the importanceof consistent and functional style selections: notions of style sheets from professionalpublishing have made their way into the mainstream of web-based ocument design--including consistent presentation formatting using Cascaded Style Sheets and flexibledocument rendering using, for example, the Document Style Semantics and Specifi-cation Language (DSSSL, ISO/IEC 10179) and the Extensible Stylesheet Language'sFormatting Objects (XSL:FO; W3C).
Professional bodies concerned with the closelyrelated theme of Information Design--the application of processes of design (that is, plan-ning) to the communication ofinformation (its content and language as well as its form) (Waller1996)--have also grown considerably both in number and membership.
Moreover,the importance of some notion of rhetoric for professional design and layout is in-creasingly accepted (cf., Schriver \[1996\]).
Less clear in such work is precisely how tocharacterize and teach useful notions of rhetoric.
Our work on the rhetorical basis oflayout interfaces directly with these developments, and establishes a new bridge be-tween options for consistent microtypography at one end, right through to high-levelcommunicative goal-based text design at the other.Concretely, our work has highlighted the importance of further rounds of de-tailed empirical investigation, interlocked with critical evaluation.
Our general mech-anism for assigning the material of a rhetorical structure to a layout is highly non-deterministic--at virtually all points we need to appeal to heuristics to make a finaldecision.
Our investigations so far indicate, however, that this is not a weakness in ourformulation: the nondeterminism arises instead from the fact that the layout process isjust as flexible as we describe it.
The further restriction of the process o as to produce"appropriate" layouts can only proceed by establishing more motivated heuristics--and these heuristics will depend crucially on the particular applications, documenttypes, target audiences, and informational content concerned.
The rather heteroge-neous set of heuristics currently adopted withIn the DArtbio system, for example, willneed to be replaced by a framework of empirically motivated constraints; some ofthis work has now been started (Bateman, Delin, and Allen 2000; Delin, Bateman, and445Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3Allen, forthcoming).
The layouts produced will then need detailed evaluation--bothfrom design experts and from users--as Schriver et al (1996) should be the case forhuman-designed documents.
Only in this way will it be possible to start refining themodel of layout we have developed so as to even begin to cover the diversity andflexibility of layouts observable in professionally produced documents.AcknowledgmentsThe work in this paper was carried out inthe context of the J~OMET-PAvE multimediapage-generation experiment (GMD-IPSI,1994-1996).
