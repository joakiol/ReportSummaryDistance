INTRODUCTIONThe theory of lexical phonology (LP)seeks to explain the inter-relationshipsbetween morphology and phonology byallocating some of the phonologicalprocesses to the dictionary or lexicon inwhich the morphemes reside.
The functionsof brackets and boundary symbols found inother phonological representations aresubsumed into the framework of the system.The domains of both morphological andphonological rules within the lexicon aresubdivided into strata which define both thetype of morphological process applicableand the mode of operation (i.e.
whethercyclic or non.cyclic) of the associatedphonological rules.
Processes applied onearly strata are invisible to those of laterstrata through the application of the "BracketErasure Convention".A computational system, LexPhon, hasbeen devised to demonstrate the principles ofLP.
LexPhon comprises a level-orderedphonological interpreter and a set oflinguistic tools for reformulating the stratumcontrol, developing phonological rule setsand for devising phoneme inventories,including natural class categorisation toolsfor making explicit the conjunctiverelationships between the elements of theinventories derived.Aspects of LP incorporated into LcxPhonare the Strict Cyclicity Condition, BracketErasure and both cyclic and noncycliccontrol mechanisms.
Syllabification isbased on the Maximal Onset Principle andfully-specified underlying representationsare assumed.
The number of strata andattribution of each stratum to either cyclic ornoncyclic control is variable by the user.Ordered sets of phonological rules areallocated to strata.LexPhon is used for comparison ofpotential structures for the level-orderedframeworks within which the phonologicalrules operate and for alternative formulationsand assignments of the rules themselves.Conclusions can be drawn about theeffectiveness of each from the broadphonemic transcriptions resulting fromapplying any given setting of the system tolarge quantities of data and from theprocessing traces also provided.An example is given of the application ofLexPhon to the study of speech style, usingdata from reported studies of English andMexico City Spanish and its ability to modelthe alternative surface forms evidenced bythe data, through the re-allocation of thesame set of phonological rules to differentstrata, is evaluated.2.
LEXlCAL PHONOLOGY (LP)Lexical phonology (Kiparsky, 1982;1982b; Halle and Mohanan, 1985, Booij andRubach, 1987; and many others) is a recentapproach to generative phonology(Chomsky and Halle, 1968) in which theapplication of the phonological rules, whichmap from the abstract, underlying form of aword to its surface, phonetic realisation, istied to the morphological word formation ~processes taking place.Morphological nd phonological rules areseen as part of the lexicon and are groupedinto strata.
The order of interaction betweenmorphological nd phonological components43is stratum-depndant.
Thus, LP ties theapplication of phonological rules tomorphological structure in a particularlyclose way.
It provides a highly structuredframework in which to develop and evaluatethe rules and representat ions forphonological transformations.
However,while there is considerable support for thetheory of stratification of morphologicalrules and the cyclic nature of the applicationof some phonological rules, opinion isdivided as to the number of strata requiredand the level(s) to which each of theidentified phonological rules is assigned inany given language and further, as towhether such higher level control structuresare universal (Booij and Rubach, 1987) orlanguage specific (Kiparsky, 1982, Halleand Mohanan, 1985).In addition to linear representations, LPaccounts of linguistic phenomena arefrequently formulated within the formatsprovided by autosegmental and metrical, ornonlinear phonology (for examples seeTranel, 1987; van der Hulst and Smith,1982; Halle and Vernaud, 1982; Leben,1982; etc.).
LP descriptions usually adoptthe two principle tiers from autosegmentalphonology, the melody and the skeleton, torepresent the data.
Further layers and/or thehierarchical representations of metricalphonology may be introduced whenrequired.The melody corresponds roughly to thelinear representation f segments whereasthe skeleton carries the positional or timinginformation in x-slots.
The x-slots,sometimes further distinguished asC and Vslots, generally correspond one-to-one withthe segments and are anchored to elementsof the melody tier.
However, in the case oflong vowels, for instance, two skeletal slotsmay be attached to the same vowel.
Emptyslots and floating segments are alsopermitted by this theory.Both morphological and phonologicalhigher level structures may be attached to theskeleton tier allowing other levels oforganisation, such as onset and rime withinsyllables, to be represented, if required.Nonlinearity of both morphology andphonology is incorporated into LP throughthe structuring of the lexicon and theindependence of syllabification from theword-formation process.
For LexPhon, theconcept of timing slots has influenced thechoice of multiple segment descriptions forlong vowels and diphthongs.44Syllabification, where needed, is derivedfrom the current segmental representationwhich thus reflects both the melody andskeleton tiers.However, by permitting features and theirdomains to be independent of the segment,autosegmental phonology also allows for thedescription of feature and tonal units smallerthan a single segment.
This aspect has notbeen utilised in the current system.3.
THE LEXPHON SYSTEMLexPhon is implemented in Prolog, usingLPA MacPROLOG and is based onprinciples of lexical phonology.LexPhon is a collection of interactivelinguistic tools comprising a phonologicalprocessor, or interpreter, sets of processesfor creating and updating ph onem einventories, phonological rule-sets and LPcontrol structures and investigative tools forexploring relationships within the phonemeinventory.The phonological processor takes as inputthe underlying forms of the morphemesbelieved to contribute to a particular wordand produces, as output, a broad phonemictranscription of the resulting word.
To dothis, the processor applies sets o fphonological rules to the developing wordstring, at each level, or stratum, ofmorphological development, in order todemonstrate he transformations required toproduce the attested surface representationsof the utterance.LexPhon allows the user to experimentwith underlying forms, the structure of therules to be applied, the ordering of the rules,their application within cyclic or noncyclicstratum control and the definitions of thesegments to be manipulated.
Theinvestigative tools allow the segmentdefinitions of the phoneme inventory to beinterrogated to find groups of segmentsanswering particular feature descriptions andto find alternative descriptions of specifiedgroups of segments.All the software implemented forconfiguring the processor, updating thedatabases, investigating the properties of theselected phoneme inventory and applying theprocessor to the phonological data has beencollected into a single system which, incommon with most other Prolog software, isof a hierarchical structure.
In general, onlythe predicates at the leaves of the hierarchyperform direct actions on the data, theintermediate levels being present to select heappropriate action to be taken.
The top levelof the hierarchy is accessible to the user via apull-down top-bar menu containing fivesections of commands which control theapplication of the system.Fig.

,Natura l  C lasses  ...The first section of the menu holdscommands which control the application ofthe Interpreter to data.
The system can becalled to process pre-prepared ata files.These can be selected by name from adisplay menu or, if the user does not wish tomake an explicit selection, a default set ofdata files can be selected by the system fordemonstrat ion purposes, on a rota.Alternatively, the user may select aninteractive application, providing the data inresponse to prompts by the system.Alterations to the Control Structure, thePhonological Rule database and to thePhoneme Inventory may be made throughthe commands provided in the second, thirdand fourth sections of the control menu,respectively.
Commands are provided toallow the user to list the phoneme and ruledescriptions represented by the appropriatesections of the database and to alter or45replace them as necessary.
The Interpretercommands  may then be called todemonstrate the effects of the changes.The commands provided in the lastsection of the menu allow the user toinvestigate relationships between themembers of the current Phoneme Inventory.The user can choose to analyse this databaseby entering a list of segments by name andreceiving one or more categofisations bycommon feature values or by entering a listof features with associated values andreceiving a list of all segments in the currentinventory which satisfy those values.3.1 RepresentationsThere are basically four different ypes ofdata upon which the processor must operate.The first and most obvious one is the wordstring, the representation f the word itself ateach of its levels during the word formationprocess.
Associated with this is thephoneme representation, as each of thefundamental segments, or phonemes, whichmake up the word string has a complexstructure which serves to establish itsrelationship to all the other phonemes usedby the language under study.Within the theory of  LP bothphonological rules and strata haveparamount significance because it is throughtheir interaction that the surface alternationsbetween morphologically related words ofthe language are explained.Although the representation of theaffixation process is itself inherent in thisinteraction process, an affix morphemerepresentation has also been devised forLexPhon, to enable the user to dictate thelevels at which aff ixation data isincorporated into the word string when thefull underlying form is presented to thesystem by means of a data file.3.1.1 PhonemesPhonemes are represented by simplepredicates of two arguments, the name,which is a phonetic haracter, and the featurespecification.
The phoneme inventory isfully-specified for all the features used byHalle and Mohanan (!985) in theirdescription of LP for English.
Thespecification is implemented as a list ofnegative and/or positive value elements to bematched against a list of feature names toobtain the complete description.
This meansthat 2-valued logic ~s c~,ploy~  queW t~edatabase.Two separate lists of  feature ~raes areavailable so that vowels can be specified fortenseness whereas consonants are specgfiedfor stridency.

in thisex~p~e) and the resulting phone which ithaa created (x in this example) and lists thefull set of feature values for the new phone.I f  the phone matches a description in thecurrent phoneme inventory, its label is thename of that phoneme.
Thus, in the outputof both the rule (shown as the partial stringbeginning with the start of the context) andthe stratum, two instances of the phoneme xreplace the two instances of the phoneme Efound in the input string.In the case of data provided from datafiles, the word string may also containatomic elements representing word andcompound boundaries and affixes to beapplied at particular strata.
The actualworking string(s) consists of anyconsecutive sequence, within the wordstring, of segment names and 'new'boundary markers (i.e.
the boundarymarkers which denote junctures within thecurrent stratum).e.g.lwordboundary,compboundary ,  g, r, c, c, n,compboundary ,  h, ~, ~, s,compboundary ,  los2, nE:s2,wordboundary\]The level of affixation of an atomicmorpheme is denoted by a numberconcatenated to the end of the string ofsegments which represents its underlyingform.
This is matched to a list of potentialaffixation types which forms one of theparameters to each stratum definitionpredicate.
Markers denoting compoundboundaries must be inserted before, betweenand after, the lists of elements defining thecomponents to be attached by compounding,to ensure that associated affixes areconjoined in the correct order.
In this casemore than one current working string maybe being processed at any one time withinthe word string.As with the interactive word stringrepresentation, a  atomic structure called'new' is included in each affix segment listwhen the affixation process takes place andthe morpheme is expanded into itscomponent segment names, to provide anexplicit juncture which may be required forthe context of some of the phonologicaltransformation rules.e.g.\ [wordboondary,  g, r, ee, x, n,Dew, h, a, o, s, new,  1, c, s,new, n, E, s, wordboundary\]These extra items are deleted at the end ofthe stratum in which they are introduced to47ensure that the junctures from that stratumarc not visible to later strata.3.2 Phonological RulesPhonological Transformation Rules mayinvolve replacement, transposition, deletionor insertion of segments.Each rule is represented in the data-baseby a Prolog predicate with six arguments.e.g.prule(3, \[I, s, xl Rest\], \[x, z, xlRest\], 's -> z / z ... x .
',scc, nsyll):-!.The first parameter is the rule number "which is used in rule ordering and inallocation of rules to strata.
The second andthird parameters epresent the string to bereplaced by the rule and the substitutionstring respectively.
Each consist of a list ofone or more phoneme names (and possiblynew morpheme boundary and/or syllableboundary atoms) or variables, designatingthe segments undergoing transformation a dtheir contexts, and a list variable to beinstantiated to the remainder of the workingstring.
The list variable ensures that theremaining part of the word list, which hasnot taken part in the transformation, ismaintained in its current form as part of theword list.Where a segment is represented by avariable or a feature bundle, the predicatewill normally have one or more clauses to beinvoked to satisfy the conditions on thatsegment.
Thus, in the general case, the headof the prule predicate will be followed by alist of clauses representing the conditions tobe satisfied in order for the rule applicationto succeed and the operations to beperformed to instantiate all the relevantinformation for its consequences to beimplemented.e.g.
the diphthongization ruleprule(46,\[Phon,Phon l Rest\],\ [Phon,NewphoniRest \ ] ,  'V ->\ [+h igh , - low, ix round\ ]  / \[V,+vowel,  txback,-high\] .
.
.
.
',scc, nsyll) :-feature(Phon,consonant  al,n),a lpha(back,Val ,Phon),feature(Phon,high,n), !,reconstruct(Phon,Newphon,Features,\[high,p,low,n,round,?
Va l \ ] ) .Each rule also has a parameter which isthe atomic form of the linguistic descriptionof the rule.
This is used for displaypurposes in listing the rule and, in the caseof a rule which has been generatedinteractively, will be the actual string fromwhich the rule has been generated by thesystem.The last two parameters which must bespecified for each rule denote whether itobeys the Strict Cyclicity Condition andwhether it requires that the string to which itis to be applied has been syllabified prior toapplication.
The SCC marker must be setexplicitly by the user when generating therule but the syllabification marker will be setautomatical ly during interactive rulegeneration if the context for the rule containsa syllable boundary marker.The rules in phonological rule databaseare explicitly ordered by means of theiridentifying numbers.
Phonological rules canbe represented disjunctively in the database,if necessary, by asserting a series of rules inthe Prolog code, all allocated to the samerule number.Explicit variables can be attached tosegments to indicate that two or moresegments must be identical in a particularcontext.An interactive rule interpreter is providedwhich accepts awide range of input formatsincluding segment labels, feature bundledescriptions, or-notation and segmentvariable labels and translates the linguisticformulation of a phonological rule intoProlog predicates which implement it.3.3 The Control SystemAfter accepting the root form, theinteractive control system calls the stratumcontrol mechanism to act upon the workingstring by recursing over the current stratumdefinitions until all the processes associatedwith each of the strata defined have beenapplied.
A s imi lar mechanism isimplemented tooperate upon data predicatesread from data files.
These mechanisms areimplemented by means of tail recursion.Failure of the main predicate which definesthe control mechanism allows a secondpredicate to be invoked.
This will alwayssucceed, returning the current value of theworking string as the value of the resultvariable.Each call to the stratum controlmechanism is invoked with the stratumnumber variable already instantiated.
Thus,the top-level call passes 1 as the stratumnumber for the first level of processing.eg.
the control predicate which governsprocessing for data input interactively hasthe following definitions:do_al l_strat(Number, Input,Output):-stratum(Number, First, Last,_, Cyc le) ,do-s t rat (Number ,  Input ,Nextstring, First, Last, _ ,Cycle) ,INextnum is Number + 1,do_all_strat(Nextnum,Nextstring, Output).do_all_strat(_, String, String).48and is initially called with Numberinstantiated to I and Input instantiated tothewordlist consisting of the segments of theroot morpheme.Assuming that a stratum I exists in thecurrent control structure (ie.
that there is atleast one stratum in the currently modelledsystem), this stratum definition is matchedby the first clause which thereby instantiatesall the variables necessary to implement theprocessing of the first stratum.
Thesevariables are then passed to another predicate'do_strat' which carries out the processing,returning the final state of the working stringat the end of the stratum, instantiated to thevariable Nextstring.
The number of the nextstratum is then calculated and this is thenused, together with the value of the currentworking string, to call the next stratum byre-applying the same predicate.
Thiscontinues until the 'stratum' predicate fails tomatch, indicating that no further strata havebeen defined for this model of lexicalphonology.The first predicate of 'do all strat' thenfails also and the second predicate is theninvoked, always succeeding, associating thevalue of the current working string (Input) tothe Output variable of this last stratum call.This is instantiated tothe Output variable inthe call which generated it and thusinstantiated to the Output variables in allprevious calls by being passed back as thevalue of the final variable in each call.
Thusthe value of Output returned from the firstcall to the 'do all strat' predicate is the sameas that of the working string (Nextstring) atthe end of the last call which found a newstratum to apply.As each call to the stratum controlmechanism is invoked with only the stratumnumber instantiated, it must first attempt tounify the remaining control variables in thecall with the associated values in a predicateof the stratum definition database whichdefines the stratum identified by thatnumber, if such a stratum exists.
I f  nomatching predicate is found for this levelthen the call succeeds without furtherrecursion by means of the second controlpredicate.Further processing is then carried out toconvert the working string from the listform, in which the segments may beindividually manipulated, to a characterstring.
At this stage all the segments in thelist should be symbols  represent ingphoneme names.
The resulting stringrepresents he broad phonemic transcriptionwhich is the product of the Processor.e.g.Phonemic Transcription:sizzInlrJIn the case of data supplied from file, itmay happen that, if affixation processeswhich can only be resolved at later strataseparate affix atoms for earlier strata fromthe root form, then these earlier affixes willnever be resolved.
Also, if the applicationof a phonologica l  rule involves atransformation upon a segment which resultsin the creation of a new segment not listed inthe current phoneme inventory, segmentdescriptors may remain in the working stringat the end of processing.
In either of thesecases, an appropriate message will begenerated and the working string will bedisplayed in its list form in place of thephonemic transcription which results from acompletely successful application of thesystem.e.g.Unresolved atoms in t h efinal working string\[wordboundary,compboundary,s,p,o,o,n,s,compboundary,f,u,l,compboundary,wordboundary\]The phonological rules are applied, innumerical order, in blocks defined by thestratum definition predicates.
These blocksmust each contain a contiguous et of rulesfrom the current data-base, the onlyrestriction being that the last rule numberspecified must be the same as or higher thanthe first rule number.
Thus, blocks mayoverlap and the rules attached to a laterstratum need not be defined later than thoseattached to earlier strata.
Although rules areapplied ordinaily within each stratum, thereis no requirement that a rule must be definedfor every number within the range of thatstratum.3.3.1 Control MechanismsCyclic and noncyclic Stratum ControlMechanisms are defined and govern theordering of morphological affixation andphonological transformation phases for eachstratum.For cyclic application, the relevant rulesfor the stratum are applied to any appropriatecontexts in the current working string,subject o the SCC condition which preventsapplication of any rule which has beenmarked for SCC, on this cycle, and then theappropriate morphological ffixation processis invoked.
For interactive use, an interfaceis provided to elicit and validate the data inthe correct format.
Data supplied from adatafile is validated and checked against hestratum information to ensure that the currentstratum is an appropriate level at which toincorporate it into the word s t r ing .Following every subsequent affixation at thesame stratum, the phonological rulesassigned to that stratum are reapplied.In non-cyclic strata, all affixation takesplace before the associated block o fphonological rules is applied, once only, tothe outcome of the affixation process.To complete the implementation f thecontrol strategies described in the Halle andMohanan paper, for stratum 3, thecompounding level, the cyclic controlmechanism has been expanded for thedefault model.
If compounding takes placethen stratum 2 is re-invoked to test forfurther morphological affixation beforecompleting stratum 3 and, if this occurs,both the morphological and phonologicalcomponents of stratum 2 are re-applied.
In49the Halle and Mohanan model, the onlypossible morphological process at stratum 3is compounding.However, in order to make the system asflexible as possible, the 'hmspecial'predicate set, which controls the order ofapplication of morphological andphonological processes, has been extendedto include all types of affixation ormallypossible, in parallel with the normal cycliccontrol mechanism.
Only compoundingcauses the loopback mechanism to beinvoked even if other classes of affixationhave been authorised at stratum 3.
Theloopback mechanism returns the currentworking string unchanged if no affix isfound but invokes the phonological rulepredicate followed by the normal 'cyclerule'predicate if affixation has been successful.This enables further affixation to take place,if necessary, cycling through stratum 2 foreach affixation process.As this is an extension to the stratum 3affixation process, no bracket erasure takesplace between the two strata during thelooping process.
A single application of thebracket erasure predicate is invoked only onfinal completion of stratum 3, i.e.
whenthere is no further compounding and nofurther stratum 2affixation to be processed.This means that all the 'new' conjunctionatoms introduced at both stratum 2 andstratum 3 are available throughout hisoperation.This mechanism raises many theoreticalproblems.
However, the objective of itsimplementation n LexPhon was to ascertainthe closest possible correspondence to thedescriptions provided by Halle and Mohanan(1985) in order to explore its consequences,so it is sufficient to note here that practicaldemonstrations (Williams, 1993) indicatethat the loopback mechanism isunnecessarily cumbersome and does notachieve the consequences predicted for it.The Halle and Mohanan description waschosen as the default model as it is both themost complex and the most completelyspecified model of LP available.
Otherdescriptions of LP were taken into accountin trying to make LexPhon sufficientlyflexible to be utilised in contrasting a widevariety of approaches toLP.In addition to being a tool for developinglinguistic descriptions, it is intended that theprocessor should itself be a model of thecontrol structures of LP.Although the system has not yet beenapplied extensively to languages other thanEnglish, one of the fundamental tenetscommon to the various approaches toLP isthat the mechanisms which apply the rulesare language independent but that thephoneme inventory, the morphological ndphonological rules and the number andcyclicity of the strata re language dependent(Kiparsky, 1982; Halle and Mohanan, 1985;but see also Booij and Rubach, 1987, foruniversal model of stratification).
Thesystem has been developed to reflect thisview with the modules which represent thephoneme inventory, the rulebase and thestratum definitions being independent andinteractively changeable.
This alsofacilitates comparisons between alternativemodels of the same language.3.4 Summary of  the LexPhon defaultmodel.The default phonological interpreter isbased on Halle and Mohanan's (1985)detailed escription of LP which providesfor a framework of five strata, four of whichoperate within the lexicon.
The postlexicaland second lexicai strata are noncyclic, allother strata being cyclic in application.Although fundamentally c clic, stratum 3,the level at which compounding takes place,has a much more complex structure allowingfor backtracking tostratum 2under specificcircumstances.
LexPhon can b ereconfigured by the user to provide forpotentially any number of strata, each ofwhich must be designated as cyclic ornoncyclic.The default databases of the LexPhonsystem comprise the phoneme inventorycontaining the 42 phonemes li ted above, 24of the rules suggested by Halle andMohanan (1985) and the five stratum modelalso proposed by Halle and Mohanan.Descriptions of the current state of eachdatabase can be invoked from the LexPhonsystem menus.
The default definitions aresummarised in the tables below.The segment label /y /appears  in thedefailt phoneme inventory so that the Halleand Mohanan rule specifications could bematched as closely as possible for the defaultrule set.
It is exactly equivalent to the IPAsymbol / j /more  commonly used for thesame feature specification.50coronalanterior lhighTable 1: Phone(eme) definitionsI x I '  l ,  lulul,lol l o o =,  a, o 3, o y w r ,  l t=onsowta l ln ln ln ln ln ln ln ln ln  n .

SPEECH STYLE  STUDYThe term "speech style" usually refers tointra-speaker variation although there is notas yet any consensus as to its scope(Llisterri, 1992).
Definitions andcategorisations may relate to the context inwhich the speech occurred (formal/informal); to the task involved in producingthe speech (read/descriptive/conversational);to the speed at which the speech is produced(rapid/slow); or to the amount of attention52believed to be directed to the speakingprocess (casual/careful).
Stylistic variationsmay be restricted to prosodic, phonetic andphonemic ontrasts or extend to syntax,choice of lexical items or even choicebetween different languages (Milroy, 1987).Thus, speech style may be seen as a singlecontinuum along which each of thecontributory factors may be ranged (Labov,1981) or as a set of distinct categories withinwhich there can be intra-style variation(Milroy, 1987).
Further, different factorscan result in the same phonemic or phoneticcontrasts (Kreidler, 1989).Harris (1969) presented a study ofHispanic phonology in which he contrastedthe regular variations in pronunciationswhich occurred, relative to the speed atwhich each utterance was produced.
Heidentified four different speeds which couldbe characterised for the Mexico City dialectof Spanish under study.
These comprised:Largo, slow and also described asoverprecise; Andante, not quite so slow andconsidered typical of natural careful speech;Allegretto, somewhat faster and typical ofnatural casual speech; and Presto, extremelyfast and unconstrained.The styles are distinguished b ydifferences innasal and sibilant assimilationsas well as by other variants.
The assimilationphenomena seem to be at least partiallydependent on differences in the level ofboundaries which must be specified in thephonological rules.
This suggests that thelevel ordering of LP might enable a simplercharacterisation f speech style contrast beformulated.Although Harris defines tyle in terms ofspeech speed he assumes a direct correlationbetween this and the level of attention orcarefulness applied to speaking.
Both theamount of care taken and the degree ofprecision with which an utterance is formedare hypothesised to decrease with increasesin the rate at which the utterances areproduced.
Hence, this comparison exploresvariations in the pronunciation f the sameutterances under varying conditions ofspeech speed and/or carefulness.
It iscontrasted with a similar study of reportedcasual versus more careful and/or formalforms in British English.4.1.
The Hispaoic StudyThe nasal-assimilation a d s-voicing rulessuggested by Harris (1969) are applied tounderlying forms in the context of a level-ordered LP of Spanish, together with thevowel-glide transformation rule which feedsthe nasal and sibilant assimilation rules incertain contexts.
Thus, certain adjustmentsto the Phoneme Inventory were required.
Inaddition to language-specific d fferences inthe phoneme inventory, Harfis's treatmentof the Mexico City data explicitly rescindsthe distinction between phonemic andphonetic levels.
The voiced velar fricative isneeded and Harris posits several additionalnasal symbols to support his account.
Intotal, he suggests three underlying nasalsegments and an additional four nasalvariants which appear in surface forms ofthe Mexico City data.4.
I. I The Hispanic Phoneme InventoryIn principle, there is no limit to the size ofthe phone/phoneme inventory in LexPhon.However, in the current system the featureset from which the phonemic segments arecreated is fixed and some processes can onlyoperate upon Single character labels.
Inaddition to 'coronal', 'anterior' and 'back',Harris employs the feature 'distributed' todistinguish between the Hispanic nasals.This is not currently available in LexPhon.Thus, the full set of nasal segments availablefor the Spanish speech study, and thefeatures over which they vary, were asfollows:Table 4: The Hispanic nasalsrn n fi q ficorona l  ?
?anter io r  + +back  - +\ [h igh  !
+where /m/ , /n /  and / f i /  are theunderlying nasals and/q /  and/ f i /  arerespectively the velar nasal and the additional'+coronal', '-anterior' nasal, hypothesisedby Harris, to be present and distinctalthough acoustically indistinguishable fromthe a lveolar /n/ .
Each of these has beenallocated a single character label whoseappearance in the LexPhon display font isthe corresponding IPA character.The phoneme inventory was updated firstto ensure that any segments which might berequired for rule definitions would beavailable.
This is important as the ruleinterpreter has data validation mechanismsso that, at the time of input, all segmentlabels must refer to segments within thecurrent phoneme inventory.4.1.2 The Hispanic RulesSince rules in cyclic strata must relate toderived forms, whereas rules in non-cyclicstrata re not permitted to refer to embeddedboundaries, two forms of the s-voicing andnasal-assimilation rules were derived.The vowel-glide transformation rule mustbe formulated with respect to new derivationat the start of its context, so only one formisrequired as it is neither cross-boundary norword-formation independent i  its action andcan therefore apply at any stratum.
It mustprecede both nasal-assimilation a d s-voicing, as it feeds both rules.I I = \[ - consonanta l ,  +high, -tense \ ]  -> \ [ - sy l lab ic \ ]  / &_\[+syl labic\] .Harris provides a series of possibledefinitions for the nasal assimilation rule.The rule context includes various alternativeboundaries or optional boundaries atdifferent speech speeds.
Additionally, forfast speech (e.g.
Allegretto), Harris requiresextra constraints on the nasals to ensure that/ m/  is unaffected before /n / ,  and toaccount for nasal assimilation toword-onsetglides.14 = \ [nasa l \ ]  -> \ [ i xcorona l ,13anterior, 1~back, 6h igh\ ]  / _& \ [ - sonorant ,  i xcorona l ,~anter ior ,  ~back,  f ihigh\].22 = n -> \ [ txcorona l ,  5h igh ,  -13anter ior ,  Kback \ ]  / _ \ [ -53sy l lab ic ,  o<corona l ,  13high,?

In this case, as the lowest level wordboundaries involved only monomorphemicdefinite and indefinite articles, it was deridedto treat these as an additional word-internallevel and reserve the word boundary symbolto designate phrase boundaries and higherlevel constituent boundaries.As the plural morpheme consistentlyoccurs after other possible suffixes, I haveassumed at least two word-internal levels.Thus, most word internal affixes weredesignated type 1, inflectional affixes weredesignated type 2, definite and indefinitearticles were designated type 3 and phraseboundaries were identified by the wordboundary symbol.Three sets of data were selected to includeas many cases as possible of  nasal and As/segments in contexts elected to contrast thesame underlying phoneme string withdifferent boundaries for as many differentphoneme sequences as possible.A total of  76 words or short phrases wereincluded ?
in the databases tested on all fivesettings of  the system.
They were selectedIo provide as many contrastive contexts aspossiblc with examples for each level ofboundary wherever possible.
A selection ofthese are shown below.54Table 5: Examples of Hispanic data\ [word(s)  \[ under ly ing  form I translationwb,d,t,s,d,c,Wb sincedesdefiar wb.d?,1.a.t.n.orl.wb to distainlos dientes wb,los$,q,x,c,n,t,c,s2,wb the teethhasta wb,h,a,|,t,a.wbdest~r  wb,dts I .t,lc,?,lr I ,wbwb,los3.l,a.g,o,s2,wb,d,?,wb loslagos delos lagos aranchowb,los3,I,a,g,o,s2,wb,a,wbwb,r,o,n,~,o,wbinmenso wb,lnl,m,c,n,s,o,wbwb,a,n,k,a,wbwb.o,a,n,g,a,wb gangaajenjonietoWbpilpN,t,fl,N~O,Wbwb,n,ldC,t,o,wbun hielo wb,un3,x,c,i,o,wbnuevo wb,n,u,c,v,o,wbun huevo wb,un3,u,c.v.o,wbUI'I OSO wb,un3,o,s,o,wbwb,kon l,p,a,d,r,c,wb  mr, econ padre wb,kon3,p,a,d,r,c,wbuntilto discolourthe lakes ofthe lakes atranchhugehaunchbargainabsinthgrandsona frostnewan e~8abearaquaintaneewith father4.1.4 The Control StructureOptional boundaries are dealt with withinthe theory of  LP by assuming that noboundary is specified in the rule and the ruleis either attached to several strata (Halle andMohanan, 1985) or to the first stratumfollowing the resolution of  all boundariesacross which it may apply (Booij andRubach, 1987).
Fol lowing Booij andRubach, I assumed that normal derivation upto word level would take place within a threestratum model  consist ing o f  cycl ic,postcyclic and post lexical strata andtherefore selected a five stratum model tobegin the investigation (one for each level ofaffixation, plus one to ensure that rulescould be applied after all word-formationprocesses were complete, including bracketerasure).
The word formation processeswere assigned in order with type 1 processesat stratum 1, type 2 at stratum 2, type 3 atstratum 3and word boundaries at stratum 4.Five contrastive settings of  the model,which varied only in the assignment ofphonological rules to strata, were prepared:Table 6: The Hispanic Control settingsStratum C1 C2 c3 c4 c51 10-16 10-16 10-16 10-16 10-162 25-49 20-49 II-ll I1-11 I I - I I3 50-59 50-59 20-59 11-11 I1-114 60-69 60-69 60-69 20-69 I1-115 90-99 90-99 90-99 90-99 20-99Rule-sets allocated to strata may include"empty sets" if no rules have been allocatedto any of the rule numbers assigned4.1.5 The ResultsResults are shownexamples inTable 5.for each of theTable 7: Example Results (Hispanic study)rCl C2/C3dcsdE dczd~dzzdzfiorC4Iosdzcntcs Iozdxznl?shastodcstcflirIoslagosdcIoslagosarondoxnmcnso  imm~nsoank8genoaON~OHOnx~loUnlt|ODUEUOaQkagaQQeaacQXounuzvoInzlagosd?Iozla~oseUf~W?VOC5Iozlagozdzunogokompadr?konpadrc kompadr?The broad phonemic transcriptionsresulting from the three data sets indicate acorrespondence from the slow to fast speechwith the re-assignment of the phonologicalrules from low to high strata.
However,within this progression, the detailed analysisof the data presented by Harris demonstratessome anomalies.
It is not possible to assignthe settings CI-C5 to the speech stylesLargo, Andante, Allegretto and Presto on aone-to-one (or even many-to-one) basis.
Ateach level there may be forms which Harrisassigns to contrasting styles.
This may bepartially due to the imperfect assignment ofstructure to the data items examined.For the Mexico City dialect, Largo speechroughly corresponds to settings C1-C2 ofthe LP control system proposed here forSpanish, Andante to C2-C3, Allegretto toC4-C5 and Presto may correspond to C5.Thus, the LP model, implemented inLexPhon, appears to give a reasonably goodapproximation to the data available.4.2.
The English StudyA more modest study of English stylecontrast data is included to examine whethersimilar stratum assignment of phonologicalrules can account for the casual/careful stylecontrasts found in standard British English.Again the Booij and Rubach model (1987)has been extended to investigate furlheraspects of the data through the inclusion ofan additional stratum and the re-allocation frules to strata.Descriptions of English style contraststend to be less well structured than theHarris (1969) study of the Mexico Citydialect.
The most common contrasts appliedto spontaneous utterances are betweencareful and casual speech or between formaland informal speech.
These two styles aresometimes, but not always, assumed tocorrespond.
In either case, study is notlimited to a comparison of binaryalternations but usually relates to a series ofutterance forms varying from one extreme ofthe style to the other.
Laver (1991), forexample, cites seven possible utteranceforms for the single word 'actually' varyingfrom most formal to most informal style ineducated Southem British English.Kreidler (1989) lists vowel reduction,vowel oss, consonant loss and assimilationamong the processes of reduction whichcontrast formal with informal or rapidEnglish speech.
Stress assignment is animportant factor in identifying the contexts towhich these apply and less formal speechmay exhibit some or all of these processes.However, Kreidler suggests that apart fromphonemic ontext, the familiarity of aparticular word or phrase may also affect heamount of reduction which it may undergo.Although listing contrastive most careful andmost casual forms, Kreidler too states thatthere may be one or more intermediatepronunciations.The Phonological Rules and PhonemeInventory used here are the default databasesprovided for LexPhon, mainly derived fromHalle and Mohanan's (1985) description ofLP.
Four strata were derived by adding anadditional noncyclic stratum to the Booij andRubach (1987) model and again 5contrastive settings were used in whichblocks of the 24 ordered rules areprogressively allocated to later strata toreflect more casual speech.
The originalrule-ordering is maintained throughout.Table 8: Control Settings for English StyleSt ra tum C!

Word-internal assimilationsinvolving y-insertion and palatalization havetaken place.
At the fourth setting, in whichmany of the noncyclic rules are attached tothe final stratum and are applied after allword-formation is complete, a number ofassimilations involving palatalization and y-insertion take place across word boundariesas well as word-internally.Further variations are demonstratedbetween the fourth and fifth settings.
At thefifth setting all post-cyclic rules operatewithin the final, post-word-level, stratumcausing spimntization toapply to contextsspanning word-boundaries.The variations resulting from the firstthree settings generally reflect a relativelyformal, carefully pronounced speech style,although certain reductions characteristic ofspoken rather than written English have nottaken place (e.g.
'will not' rather than'won't').
Some reductions found at thefourth setting in such partial clauses as'unless you' and 'did you' are attested byKreidler (1989) as casual speech forms.However, I have found no evidence in theliterature for other reductions found at thefourth setting, nor for the further fricativereductions found at the fifth setting.
Theselatter appear to be more typical of "slurred"speech than casual speech.Much of the style-related variationreported by Laver and Kreidler does notoccur as a result of the LexPhon settingstested above.
However, the variationswhich they reported are characterised byphonological rules such as fricativeassimilation (Kreidler, p257) and clusterreductions, not required (or not yetimplemented in LexPhon) for the derivationof the standard forms of the utterances.Thus, the model provides a partial butinadequate description of careful/casualcontrasts found in British English.5.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSLexPhon, a computational frameworkfor models of lexical phonology, has beendescribed and an example application of onepotential use of such a system has beenpresented.Using LexPhon, contrastive L Pstructures were applied to Spanish andEnglish data in the context of language-dependant Phoneme Inventories andPhonological Rule sets.A hypothesis was tested that intm-speakerstyle variation might be the result ofapplying the same rules to the sameunderlying forms but at different stages ofthe utterance formation process.
In the caseof the Spanish data for the Mexico Citydialect, allocation of rules to strata ppears toaccount for a substantial proportion of theattested variation between the speech speedstyles.
For the contrastive study of Englishcareful versus ~tsual style data, re-allocationof rules to strata appears to account for asmaller proportion of the variation attested,in spite of the use of a much morecomprehensive rule set.Although the studies presented here arenot conclusivei they provide evidence whichgives support o the theory that aspects ofstyle variation may be attributable tothe levelof word-formation at which phonologicalrules are applied, rather than necessarily todifferences in the formulation of the rulesthemselves.
This supports the LPhypothesis that complex surface phonologyof languages may be the result ofinteractions between relatively s implemorphological nd phonological processestaking place within a simple framework.Further, the application of LexPhon to aproblem requiring alternative phonemeinventory, phonological rulebase and LPcontrol framework demonstrates theflexibility which the system can offer tocomparative studies in lexical phonology.REFERENCESBooij, G,; Rubach, J. i 987 Postcyclic v.
