Since corpus re-sources are scarce, we propose an align-ment method between the syntactic treesof the Italian sentence and of its LIS trans-lation.
This method, and clustering ap-plied to its outputs, highlight the differ-ent ways a connective can be rendered inLIS: with a corresponding sign, by affect-ing the location or shape of other signs, orbeing omitted altogether.
We translatethese findings into a computational modelthat will be integrated into the pipeline ofan existing Italian-LIS rendering system.Initial experiments to learn the four possi-ble translations with Decision Trees givepromising results.1 IntroductionAutomatic translation between a spoken languageand a signed language gives rise to some of thesame difficulties as translation between spokenlanguages, but adds unique challenges of its own.Contrary to what one might expect, sign languagesare not artificial languages, but natural languagesthat spontaneously arose within deaf communities;although they are typically named after the regionwhere they are used, they are not derived from thelocal spoken language and tend to bear no similar-ity to it.
Therefore, translation from any spokenlanguage into the signed language of that specificregion is at least as complicated as between anypairs of unrelated languages.The problem of automatic translation is com-pounded by the fact that the amount of computa-tional resources to draw on is much smaller thanis typical for major spoken languages.
Moreover,the fact that sign languages employ a differenttransmission modality (gestures and expressionsinstead of sounds) means that existing writing sys-tems are not easily adaptable to them.
The result-ing lack of a shared written form does nothing toimprove the availability of sign language corpora;bilingual corpora, which are of particular impor-tance to a translation system, are especially rare.In fact, various projects around the world are try-ing to ameliorate this sad state of affairs for spe-cific Sign Languages (Lu and Huenerfauth, 2010;Braffort et al, 2010; Morrissey et al, 2010).In this paper, we describe the work we per-formed as concerns the translation of connectivesfrom the Italian language into LIS, the Italian SignLanguage (Lingua Italiana dei Segni).
Because thecommunities of signers in Italy are relatively smalland fragmented, and the language has a relativelyshort history, there is far less existing research andmaterial to draw on than for, say, ASL (AmericanSign Language) or BSL (British Sign Language).Our work was undertaken within the purview ofthe ATLAS project (Bertoldi et al, 2010; Lom-bardo et al, 2010; Lombardo et al, 2011; Prinettoet al, 2011; Mazzei, 2012; Ahmad et al, 2012),which developed a full pipeline for translating Ital-ian into LIS.
ATLAS is part of a recent crop ofprojects devoted to developing automatic transla-tion from language L spoken in geographic areaG into the sign language spoken in G (Dreuw etal., 2010; Lo?pez-Luden?a et al, 2011; Almohimeedet al, 2011; Lu and Huenerfauth, 2012).
Input istaken in the form of written Italian text, parsed,and converted into a semantic representation of itscontents; from this semantic representation, LISoutput is produced, using a custom serializationformat called AEWLIS (which we will describelater).
This representation is then augmented withspace positioning information, and fed into a fi-nal renderer component that performs the signsusing a virtual actor.
ATLAS focused on a lim-ited domain for which a bilingual Italian/LIS cor-270pus was available: weather forecasts, for whichthe Italian public broadcasting corporation (RAI)had long been producing special broadcasts witha signed translation.
This yielded a corpus of 376LIS sentences with corresponding Italian text: thiscorpus, converted into AEWLIS format, was themain data source for the project.
Still, it is a verysmall corpus, hence the main project shied awayfrom statistical NLP techniques, relying instead onrule-based approaches developed with the help ofa native Italian/LIS bilingual speaker; a similar ap-proach is taken e.g.
in (Almohimeed et al, 2011)for Arabic.1.1 Why connectives?The main semantic-bearing elements of an Italiansentence, such as nouns or verbs, typically havea LIS sign as their direct translation.
We focuson a different class of elements, comprising con-junctions and prepositions, but also some adverbsand prepositional phrases; collectively, we referto them as connectives.
Since they are mainlystructural elements, they are more heavily affectedby differences in the syntax and grammar of Ital-ian and LIS (and, presumably, in those of anyspoken language and the ?corresponding?
SL).Specifically, as we will see later, some connectivesare translated with a sign, some connectives aredropped, whereas others affect the positioning ofother signs, or just their syntactic proximity.It should be noted that our usage of the term?connectives?
is somewhat unorthodox.
For ex-ample, while prepositions can be seen as con-nectives (Ferrari, 2008), only a few adverbs canwork as connectives.
From the Italian Treebank,we extracted all words or phrases that belongedto a syntactic category that can be a connective(conjunction, preposition, adverb or prepositionalphrase).
We then found that we could better servethe needs of ATLAS by running our analysis onthe entire resulting list, without filtering it by elim-inating the entries that are not actual connectives.In fact, semantic differences re-emerge throughour analysis: e.g., the temporal adverbs ?domani?and ?dopodomani?
are nearly always preserved,as they do carry key information (especially forweather forecasting) and are not structural ele-ments.In performing our analysis, we pursued a dif-ferent path from the main project, relying entirelyon the bilingual corpus.
Although the use of sta-tistical techniques was hampered by the small sizeof the corpus, at the same time it presented an in-teresting opportunity to attack the problem froma different angle.
In this paper we describe howwe uncovered the translation distributions of thedifferent connectives from Italian to LIS via treealignment.2 Corpus AnalysisThe corpus consists of 40 weather forecasts in Ital-ian and LIS.
The Italian spoken utterance and LISsigning were transcribed from the original videos?
one example of an Italian sentence and its LISequivalent are shown in Figure 1.
An Englishword-by-word translation is provided for the Ital-ian sentence, followed by a more fluent transla-tion; the LIS glosses are literally translated.
Notethat as concerns LIS, this simply includes the glossfor the corresponding sign.
The 40 weather fore-cast comprise 374 Italian sentences and 376 LISsentences, stored in 372 AEWLIS files.
In mostcases, a file corresponds to one Italian sentenceand one corresponding LIS sentences; however,there are 4 files where an Italian sentence is splitinto two LIS sentences, and 2 files where two Ital-ian sentences are merged into one LIS sentence.AEWLIS is an XML-based format (see Fig-ure 2) which represents each sign in the LIS sen-tence as an element, in the order in which they oc-cur in the sentence.
A sign?s lemma is representedby the Italian word with the same meaning, alwayswritten in uppercase, and with its part of speech(tipoAG in Figure 2); there are also IDs referenc-ing the lemma?s position in a few dictionaries, butthese are not always present.
The AEWLIS filealso stores several additional attributes, such as:a parent reference that represents the syntax ofthe LIS sentence; the syntactic role ?played?
bythe sign in the LIS sentence; the facial expres-sion accompanying the gesture; the location in thesigning space (which may be an absolute locationor a reference to a previous sign?s: compare HR(High Right) and atLemma in Figure 2).
Theseattributes are stored as elements grouped by type,and reference the corresponding sign element byits ordinal position in the sentence.
The additionalattributes are not always available: morphologi-cal variations are annotated only when they differfrom an assumed standard form of the sign, whilethe syntactic structure was annotated for only 89sentences.271(1) (Ita.)

Thisyielded a total of 777 potential connectives.
Ofthose, only 104 occur in our corpus.
A simplecount of the occurrences of connectives in the Ital-ian and LIS versions of the corpus yields the fol-lowing results:(a) 78 connectives (2068 occurrences total) onlyoccur in the Italian version, for example AL-MENO (at least), CON (with), INFATTI (in-deed), PER (for) .
(b) 8 connectives (67 occurrences total) only oc-cur in the LIS version, for example CIRCA(about), as in ?Here I am?
), PURE (also, ad-ditionally).
(c) 25 connectives (925 occurrences total) occurin both versions.For the third category, we have computed theratio of the number of occurrences in Italian overthe number of occurrences in LIS; the ratios areplotted in logarithmic scale in Figure 3.
0 on thescale corresponds to an ITA/LIS ratio equal to 1;positive numbers indicate that there are more oc-currences in ITA, negative numbers that there aremore occurrences in LIS.
We can recognize threeclusters by ratio:(c1) 9 connectives occurring in both languages,but mainly in Italian, for example POCO (alittle), PIU?
(more), SE (if), QUINDI (hence).
(c2) 13 connectives occurring in both languageswith similar frequency, for example SOLO(only), POI (then), O (or), MA (but).

This is unsurprising, consider-ing that LIS sentences tend to be shorter than Ital-ian sentences in terms of number of signs/words (afact which probably correlates with the increasedenergy and time requirements intrinsic into artic-ulating a message using one?s arms rather thanone?s tongue).
However, our goal is to predictwhen a connective should be dropped and whenit should be preserved.
Furthermore, even if theconnective does not appear in the LIS sentence asa directly corresponding sign, that does not meanthat its presence in the Italian sentence has no ef-fect on the translation.
We hypothesize four dif-ferent possible realizations for a connective in theItalian sentence:?
the connective word or phrase may map to acorresponding connective sign;?
the connective is not present as a sign, butmay affect the morphology of the signs whichtranslate words syntactically adjacent to theconnective;?
the connective is not present as a sign, butits presence may be reflected by the fact thatwords connected by it map to signs which areclose to each other in the LIS syntax tree;?
the connective is dropped altogether.The second hypothesis deserves some explana-tion.
The earliest treatments of LIS assumed thateach sign (lemma) could be treated as invariant.Attempts to represent LIS in writing simply re-placed each sign with a chosen Italian word (orphrase, if necessary) with the same meaning.
Al-though this is still a useful way of representing thebasic lemma, more recent studies have noted thatLIS signs can undergo significant morphologicalvariations which are lost under such a scheme.
TheAEWLIS format, in fact, was designed to preservethem.Of course, morphological variations in LIS arenot phonetic, like in a spoken language, but ges-tural (Volterra, 1987; Romeo, 1991).
For exam-ple, the location in which a gesture is performedmay be varied, or its speed, or the facial expres-sions that accompany it (Geraci et al, 2008).
Oneparticularly interesting axis of morphology is thepositioning of the gesture in the signing space infront of the signer.
This space is implicitly dividedinto a grid with a few different positions from leftto right and from top to bottom (see HR ?
HighRight, and LH ?
High Left, in Figure 2).
Two ormore signs can then be placed in different posi-tions in this virtual space, and by performing othersigns in the same positions the signer can expressa backreference to the previously established en-tity at that location.
One can even have a move-ment verb where the starting and ending positionsof the gesture are positioned independently to in-dicate the source and destination of the movement.In other words, these morphological variations canperform a similar function to gender and num-ber agreement in Italian backreferences, but theycan also assume roles that in Italian would be per-formed by prepositions, which are connectives.
Infact, as we will see later on, Italian prepositions arenever translated as signs, but are often associatedwith morphological variations on related signs.3.1 Tree AlignmentTwo of our four translation hypotheses involve anotion of distance on the syntax tree, and a no-27319_f08_2011-06-08_10_04_10.xmlAnche sulla Sardegna qualche annuvolamento pomeridiano, possibilit?

Therefore,it is not sufficient to consider the LIS sentenceand the Italian sentence separately.
Instead, theirsyntax trees must be reconstructed and aligned.Tree alignment in a variety of forms has beenextensively used in machine translation systems(Gildea, 2003; Eisner, 2003; May and Knight,2007).
As far as we know, we are the firstto attempt the usage of tree alignment to aid inthe translation between a spoken and a sign lan-guage, partly because corpora that include sync-tactic trees for sign language sentences hardly ex-ist.
(Lo?pez-Luden?a et al, 2011) does use align-ment techniques for translation from Spanish toSpanish Sign Language (SSL), but it is limited toalignment between words or phrases in Spanish,and glosses or sequences of glosses in SSL.We have developed a pipeline that takes in inputthe corpus files, parses the Italian sentence withan existing parser, and retrieves / builds a parsetree for the LIS sentence.
The two trees are thenaligned by exploiting the word/sign alignment.
Asample output is shown in Figure 4.Italian sentence parsing.
Since the corpus con-tains the Italian sentences in plain, unstructuredtext form, they need to be parsed.
We used theDeSR parser, a dependency parser pre-trained on avery large Italian corpus (Attardi et al, 2007; Cia-ramita and Attardi, 2011).
This parser producedthe syntax trees and POS tagging that we used forthe Italian part of the corpus.LIS syntax tree.
One of the attributes allowedby AEWLIS is ?parent?, which points a sign to itsparent in the syntax tree, or marks it as a root (seeFigure 2).
These hand-built syntax trees are avail-able in roughly 1/4 of the AEWLIS files.
Becausethe size of our corpus is already limited, and be-274cause no tools are available to generate LIS syn-tax trees, for the remaining 3/4 of the corpus wefell back on a simple linear tree where each sign isconnected to its predecessor.
This solution at leastmaintains locality in most cases.Word Alignment.
Having obtained syntax treesfor the two sentences, we then needed to alignthem.
For this purpose we used the Berkeley WordAligner (BWA) 1 (Denero, 2007), a general toolfor aligning sentences in bilingual corpora.
BWAtakes as input a series of matching sentences intwo different languages, trains multiple unsuper-vised alignment models, and selects the optimalresult using a testing set of manual alignments.The output is a list of aligned word indices foreach input sentence pair.
On our data set, BWAperformance is as follows: Precision = 0.736364,Recall = 0.704348, AER = 0.280000.Integration.
The result is an integrated syntaxtree representation of the Italian and LIS ver-sions of the sentence, with arcs bridging alignedword/sign pairs.
Since some connectives consistof multi-word phrases, the word nodes which arepart of one are merged into a super-node that in-herits all connections to other nodes.
Figure 4shows the end result for the Italian and LIS sen-tences in Figure 1 (the two sentences are repeatedfor convenience at the bottom of Figure 4).
Therectangular boxes are words in the Italian sen-tence, while the rounded boxes are signs in the LISsentence.
The Italian tree has its root(s) at the bot-tom, while the LIS tree has its root(s) at the top.Solid arrows point from children to parent nodesin the syntax tree.
Gray-shaded boxes representconnectives (words or signs, as indicated by theborder of the box).
Bold dashed lines show wordalignment.
Edges with round heads show relation-ships where a sign has a location attribute refer-encing another sign.
Arrows with an empty tri-angular head trace the paths described in the nextsection.3.2 Subtree alignment and path processingAt this point individual words are aligned, but thatis not sufficient.
Our hypotheses on the effect ofconnectives on translation requires us to align atree fragment surrounding the Italian connectivewith the corresponding tree fragment on the LIS1http://code.google.com/p/berkeleyaligner/side - where the connective may be missing.
In ef-fect, since we have hypothesized that the presenceof a connective can affect the translation of the twosubtrees that it connects, we would like to be ableto align each of those subtrees to its translation.However, given the differences between the twolanguages, it is not easy to give a clear definitionof this mapping - let alne to compute it.Instead, we can take a step back to word-levelalignment.
We make the observation that, if twowords belong to two different subtrees linked by aconnective, so that the path between the two wordsgoes through the connective, then the frontier be-tween the LIS counterparts of those two subtreesshould also lie along the path between the signsaligned with those two words.
If the connective ispreserved in translation as a sign, we should ex-pect to find it along that path; if it is not, its ef-fect should still be seen along that path, either inthe form of morphological variations to the signsalong the path, or in the shortness of the path itself.The first step, then, is to split the Italian syntaxtree by removing the connective.
This yields onesubtree containing the connective?s parent node, ifany, and one subtree for each of the connective?schildren, if any.
The parent subtree typically con-tains most of the rest of the sentence, so only thedirect ancestors of the connective are considered.Then, each pair of words belonging to differentsubtrees is linked by a path that goes through theconnective in the original tree.
Of these words, weselect the ones that have aligned signs, and thenwe compute the path between each pair of signsaligned to words belonging to different subtrees.This gives us a set of paths to consider in the LISsyntax tree.For example, let us consider the connective ?di?between ?possibilita`?
and ?scroscio?
in Figure 4.?
This node connects two subtrees: a child sub-tree containing ?qualche, breve, scroscio, di,pioggia?, and a parent subtree containing therest of the sentence.?
From each subtree, a set of paths is gener-ated: all paths extending from the connectiveto the leaves of the child subtree (for exam-ple ?scroscio, qualche?
or ?scroscio, di, pi-oggia?
), and the path of direct ancestors inthe parent tree (?sulla, annuvolamento, pos-sibilita`?).?

For each of these paths, take the signs alignedto words on different sides of the target con-nective, and find the shortest path betweenthose signs in the LIS syntax tree; we call thisthe aligned path.
For example, from ?pos-sibilita`?
and ?scroscio?
we find ?POTERE,ACQUAZZONE?.
If this process generatesmultiple paths, only the maximal ones arekept.By looking at words within a certain distance ofthe connective, at their aligned signs, and at thedistance between those signs in the aligned path,the program then produces one or more ?transla-tion candidates?
for each occurrence of a connec-tive:?
Sign: if the connective word is aligned to aconnective sign in LIS, that is its direct trans-lation;?
Location: if morphology variations (cur-rently limited to the ?location?
attribute, seeFigure 2) are present on a sign aligned to anIt.

Close: if two It.
words are connected bya connective, and they map to signs whichhave a very short path between them (up to3 nodes, including the two signs), the con-nective may be reflected simply in this closeconnection between the translated subtrees inthe LIS syntax tree;?
Missing: if none of the above hypotheses arepossible, we hypothesize that the connectivehas been simply dropped.Table 1 shows the results of this analysis.
It in-cludes only connectives with more than 10 occur-rences.
For each connective and translation hy-pothesis, the shading of the cell is proportional to276the fraction of occurrences where that hypothesisis possible; this fraction is also given as a percent.Note that Sign, Location and Close candidates arenot mutually exclusive: for instance, an occur-rence of a connective might be directly alignedwith a sign, but at the same time it might fit thecriteria for a Location candidate.
For this reason,the sum of the percents in the four columns is notnecessarily 100.k-means clustering (MacQueen, 1967; Lloyd,1982) has been applied to the connectives, withthe aforementioned fractions as the features.
Theresulting five clusters are represented by the rowgroupings in the table.The first cluster contains words which clearlyhave a corresponding sign in LIS, such as ?do-mani?
(tomorrow).
?Domani?
and ?dopodomani?are not actually connectives, while ?mentre?, ?o?and ?pero`?
are.
It is interesting to note that, whilea logician might expect ?e?
(and) and ?o?
(or) tobe treated similarly, they actually work quite dif-ferently in LIS: there is a specific sign for ?o?, butthere is no sign for ?e?.
Instead, signs are sim-ply juxtaposed in LIS where ?e?
would be used inItalian.The words in the second cluster also have a di-rect sign translation, but they are missing in theLIS translation around half of the time.
Severalwords represent connections with previous state-ments or situations, such as ?ancora?
(again), ?in-vece?
(instead), ?ma?
(but).
These appear to beoften dropped in LIS when they reference a previ-ous sentence, e.g.
a sentence-initial ?ma?
; or whenthey are redundant in Italian, e.g.
?ma?
in ?ma an-che?
(?but also?).
Therefore, we think can see twophenomena at play here: a stronger principle ofeconomy in LIS, and a reduced number of explicitconnections across sentences.The third cluster is similar to the second cluster,but with a higher percent of dropped connectives.This is probably related to the semantics of thesefive words.
?Abbastanza?
means ?quite, enough?,and in general indicates a medium quantity, notparticularly large nor particularly small.
It is nosurprise that this word is more likely to succumbto principles of economy in language.
?Anche?means ?also?, and is either translated as ?PURE?
(also) or dropped.
This does not seem to dependon the specific circumstances of its usage; rather, itseems to be largely a stylistic choice by the trans-lator.
?Proprio?
(?precisely?, ?just?)
has a corre-sponding sign ?PROPRIO?, but since it does notconvey essential information it is a good candidatefor dropping.
?Quindi?, meaning ?therefore?, hasits own sign ?QUINDI?, but once again the causalrelationship it conveys is usually not essential tounderstanding what the weather will be, and thusit is frequently dropped.The fourth cluster consists of connectives whichare largely simply dropped.
Some of these are el-ements that just contribute to the discourse flowin Italian, such as ?per quanto riguarda?
(?con-cerning?
); in fact, this connective mainly oc-curs in sentence-initial position in the Italian sen-tences in our corpus and denotes a change oftopic from the previous sentence, corroboratingour hypothesis of a reduced use of explicit inter-sentence connections in LIS.
It may seem strangefor comparative and intensity markers such as?piu`?
(more) or ?poco?
(a little) to be so consis-tently dropped, but it turns out that intensity varia-tions for weather phenomena are often embeddedinto a specific sign, for example ?NUVOLOSITA`AUMENTARE?
(increasing cloud cover).The fifth cluster contains all Italian prepositions(with 10 or more occurrences in the corpus), noneof which is translated as a sign (the 6 occurrencesfor ?in?, the 4 for ?su?
and the 2 for ?di?
are dueto alignment errors).
We can conclude that prepo-sitions do not exist in LIS as parts of speech; how-ever, the prepositions in this cluster are often asso-ciated with morphological variations in the spatialpositioning of related signs, which suggests thatthe role associated with these prepositions in Ital-ian is performed by these variations in LIS.
Theconjunction ?e?
(and) also ends up in this cluster,although it has 8 legitimate sign alignments with?pure?
(?too?
); the rest are alignment errors.
Un-surprisingly, all connectives in this class also havehigh ratings for the ?close?
hypothesis.4 Rule extractionWe trained a classifier to help a LIS generator de-termine how an Italian connective should be trans-lated.
Because the translation pipeline we plan tointegrate with is rule-based, we chose a DecisionTree as our classifier: this allows rules to be easilyextracted from the classification model.In order to identify a single class for each exam-ple, we ranked the four possible translation can-didates as follows: Sign is the strongest, thenLocation, then Close, and finally Missing is the277child1 align = None ?
word = Per quanto riguarda ?
parent align = None ?
Missingchild1 align = None ?
word = Per quanto riguarda ?
parent align = PREVEDERE ?

word = o ?
Align(O)child1 align = None ?
word = su ?
child2 align mykind = location ?
child2 align = SICILIA ?
LocationFigure 5: Some rules extracted from the decision treeweakest.
Then, each example is labeled withthe strongest translation candidate available for it:thus, for example, if the connective word appearsto be translated with a connective sign, and thewords it connects are also aligned to signs whichare close to each other syntactically, then the classis Sign, not Close.Our training data suffers from large imbalancebetween the ?missing?
class and the others.
Aclassifier that simply labels all examples as ?miss-ing?
would have an accuracy above 60%, and infact, that is the classifier that we obtain if we at-tempt to automatically optimize the parameters ofa Decision Tree (DT).
We also note that, for con-nectives where both options are possible, choosingto translate them can make the sentence more ver-bose, but choosing to drop them risks losing part ofthe sentence?s meaning: the worse risk is the lat-ter.
Following accepted practice with unbalanceddatasets (Chawla et al, 2004), we rebalanced theclasses by duplicating all examples of the Align,Location and Close classes, but not those of theMissing class.On our data set of connectives with at least10 occurrences, we trained a DT using AdaBoost(Freund and Schapire, 1997).
The features includethe word neighboring the connective in the Ital-ian syntax tree, their aligned signs if any, part ofspeech tags, and semantic categories such as timeor location.
The resulting tree is very large, butwe provide a few examples of the rules that can beextracted from it in Figure 5.Bootstrap evaluation shows our DT to have anaccuracy of 83.58% ?
1.03%.
In contrast, a base-line approach of taking the most common class foreach connective results in an accuracy of 68.70%?
0.88%.
Furthermore, the baseline classifier hasabysmal recall for the Close and Location classes(0.00% and 0.85%, respectively), which our DTgreatly improves upon (86.73% and 75.32%).In order to estimate the impact of the lack ofa LIS syntax tree in most of the corpus, we alsolearned and evaluated a DT using only the 1/4 ofthe corpus for which LIS syntax trees are avail-able.
The accuracy is 81.44% ?
2.03%, versus abaseline of 71.55% ?
1.74%.
The recall for Closeand Location is 89.22% and 73.58%, vs. 0.00%and 3.51% for the baseline.
These results are com-parable with the those obtained on the whole cor-pus, confirming that linear trees are a reasonablefallback.Both clustering and classification were per-formed using RapidMiner 5.3.
25 Conclusions and Future WorkThe small size of our corpus, with around 375bilingual sentences, posed a large challenge tothe use of statistical methods; on the other hand,having no access to a LIS speaker prevented usfrom simply relying on a rule-based approach.
Bycombining syntax tree processing with several ma-chine learning techniques, we were able to analyzethe corpus and detect patterns that show linguis-tic substance.
We have produced initial results interms of rule extraction, and we will be integrat-ing these rules into the full Italian-LIS translationsystem to produce improved translation of connec-tives.6 AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the ATLAS project,funded by Regione Piemonte within the ?CIPE2007?
