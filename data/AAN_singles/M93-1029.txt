INFORMATION EXTRACTION FOR THE FUTUR EPaul S. JacobsArtificial Intelligence Laborator yGE Research and Developmen tSchenectady, NY 12301 USApsjaco bs @crd.ge.
cornThis broad topic session covered a range of ideas on challenges for the future, along with approaches t omeeting these challenges .
Although some discussion of matters of scale was common to all the presentations ,the speakers offered different perspectives on how to achieve scale-up .Two of the presentations, "A Unified View of Different Understanding Tasks" by Dckang Lin, and "Ap-plications of Extraction Technology: Today and Tomorrow " by Christine Montgomery, focused on linguisti cprinciples and processing as ways of meeting future challenges .
Lin emphasized that a unifying theoretica lframework for understanding could lead to "graceful degradation " , helping systems to produce better results .Montgomery, while covering a number of practical applications of data extraction, stressed that there ar emany areas in which systems still perform poorly .Robert Gaizauskas' talk "Applications of Text Extraction in Police Command and Control Systems :From POETIC to GENIE" presented the "ideal " , generic information extraction system as an extension o fa current message interpretation framework, which is robust but handles only limited messages in limite ddomains .My own view, "Making Knowledge Acquisition Work" questioned the incremental approach to extendin gdata extraction systems, claiming that what systems need to make further leaps is not more of what the yhave now but more of what they don't have .
For example, lexical acquisition work has focused on learnin gfeatures of words that are usually found in computational lexicons, while scaling up seems to emphasiz eworld knowledge and discourse-level knowledge, which exist only in very limited forms today .John Burger's presentation, "Information Extraction and Text Enrichment" emphasized progress throug hthe integration of data extraction with other technologies and standards rather than the development of ne wmethods .
Burger stressed the importance of the SGML standard for document markup, explaining ho wdata extraction and document enrichment work together, creating structured texts, hypertext, and servin ga text database.
In addition to showing how data extraction could help in a document management system ,Burger pointed out that conforming to standards makes it easy to use off-the-shelf tools instead of developin gcustom research software for many functions .While there are certain areas of agreement about what systems currently can do and what they can ' t ,do, the differences among these brief talks shows some variation in opinion, not only about which problem sare most crucial, but also about how to address them .
In the discussions at MUC, there were substantia ldisputes among participants even about whether more progress is likely in the near future, and whether tha tprogress will come from more research, as most of the presenters in this session suggested, or from "fin etuning" and engineering .
It seems that the only way to find out is to continue with task-oriented evaluation slike MUC, but the rate of progress that has been made in the MUC series does not seem to be slowing .Hence the reading for the future may be "we will do better"?the open questions are how we will do better ,and how much better we will do .343
