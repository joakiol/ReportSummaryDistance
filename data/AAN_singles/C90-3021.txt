A Computational Theory of Processing Over load and Garden-Path  EffectsEdward GibsonDepartment ofPhilosophy, Carnegie Mellon UniversityPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890, USAgibson@cs.cmu.edu1 IntroductionThe limited capacity of working memory is intrinsic tohuman sentence processing, and therefore must be ad-dressed by any theory of human sentence processing.
Iassume that the amount of short term memory that is nec-essary at any stage in the parsing process is determinedby the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic properties of thestructure(s) that have been built up to that point in theparse.
A sentence becomes unacceptable for processingreasons if the combination of these properties producestoo great a load for the working memory capacity (cf.Fr~ier  (1985), Gibson (1987)):(1) t l~ Aixi > Ki=Iwhere:K is the maximum allowable processing load (inprocessing load units or PLUs),x~ is the number of PLUs associated with propertyi,n is the number of properties,Ai is the number of times property i appears in thestructure in question.Furthermore, I hypothesize that the human pat'scrprefers one structure over another when the processingload (in PLUs) associated with one structure is markedlylower than the load associated with another.
That is, I hy-pothesize there exists some arithmetic preference quantityP, corresponding toa processing load difference, such thatif the processing loads associated with two representationsdiffer by P, then only the representation associated withthe smaller of tile two loads survives.
Given the exis-tence of a preference quantity P, it is easy to account forgarden-path effects and preferred readings of ambiguoussentences.
Both effects occur because of a local ambi-guity which is resolved in favor of one reading.
Giventwo representations for the same input string that differin processing load by at least P, only the less expensivestructure will be maintained.
If that sU'ucture is not com-p,qtible with the rest of the sentence and the discardedstructure is part of a successful parse of the sentence, agarden-path effect results.
If the parse is suceessful, butthe discarded structure is compatible with another eadingfor the sentence, then only a preferred reading for the sen-tence has been calculated (cf.
Gibson (1987), Gibson &Clark (1987), Clark & Gibson (1988)).
1 Thus if we know1 An alternative to the preference constraint presented here isthe serial hypothesis, which allows at most one representationfor the input string at any stage in the parse (see, for exam-ple, Frazier & Fodor (1978), Frazier (1979), Marcus (1980),Berwick & Weinberg (1984), and Pritchett (1988)).
There isa longstanding debate in the psycholinguistic literature as towhether or not more than one representation foran input can bemaintained inparallel.
It turns out that the parallel view appearsto handle some kinds of data more directly than the serial view,where one reading of a (temporarily) ambiguous entencebecomes the strongly preferred reading, we cm~ write ,aninequality associated with this preference:(2)?t eli=1 i=1where:P is the preference factor (in PLUs),xi is the number of PLUs associated with propertyi,n is the number of properties,Ai is the number of times property i appeaJs in theunpreferred structure,Bi is the number of times property i appears in thepreferred structure.In this paper I will concentrate on syntactic properties: zin particular, I present two properties based on the 0-Criterion and Projection Principle from Government andBinding Theory (Chomsky (1981)).
3 Once these proper-ties are ,associated with processing loads, they can predicta large array of garden-path effects.
Furthermore, it isdemonstratexl that these properties also make desirablecross-linguistic predictions with respect o unacceptabil-ity due to memory capacity overload.The organization of this paper is given as follows.
Sec-tion 2 describes the s~ucture of the underlying parserthat is ,assumed.
Section 3 includes the proposed syn-tactic properties.
Section 4 examines a number of lo-cally ambiguous entences, including some garden-paths,with respect to these properties.
Section 5 explores anumber of acceptable and unacceptable sentences anddemonstrates that the properties proposed in Section 3make the right predictions with respect to processing over?load.
Furthermore, it is demonstrated in this section thatthese properties eem to make the right predictions cross--linguistically.
Some conclusions ate given in the finalsection.
4keeping in mind that the data are often controversial.
See, forexample, Kurtzman (1985)or Gorrell (1987) for a history of thedebate along with evidence in support of the parallel hypothesis.Note in particular that data normally taken to be support for theserial hypothesis nclude garden-path effects and the existenceof preferred readings of ambiguous input.
However, as notedabove, limiting the number of allowable representations is onlyone way of constraining parallelism so that these ffects are alsoeasily accounted for in a parallel framework./Note that I assume that there also exist semantic and prag-matic properties which are associated with significantproccssingloads.Sin another syntactic theory, similar properties may be ob-tained from the principles that correspond to the 0-Criterion andProjection Principle in that theory.
For example, the complete-ness and coherence conditions of Lexieal Functional Grammar(Bresnan (1982)) would derive properties imilar to those de-rived from the 0-Criterion and Projection Principle.
The sameempirical effects hould result from these two sets of properties.4This paper extends work reported in Gibson (1990) by ap-114 12 The Underlying Parse~ -~The parser to which the memory limitation constraintsapply must construct representations i  such a way sothat incomplete input will be associated with structure.Furthermore, the parsing algorithm must, in principle,allow more than one structure tor an input string, so thatthe general constraints described in the previous ectionmay apply to restrict he possibilities.
The parsing modelthat I will assume is an extension of the model describedin (Clark & Gibson (1988)).
When a word is input to thismodel, representations foreach of its lexical entries arebuilt and placed in the buffer, a one cell data structure thatholds a set of tree structures.
The parsing model containsa second ata structure, the stack-set, which contains asetof stacks of buffer cells.
The parser builds trees in parallelbased on possible attachments made between the bufferand the top of each stack in the stack-set.
The buffer andstack-set are formally defined in (3) and (4).
(3) A buffer cell is a set of structures { St ,$2, ...,S, },where each Si represents he same segment of the inputstring.
The buffer contains one buffer cell.
(4) The stack-set is a set of stacks of buffer cells, whereeach stack represents he same segment of the input string:{ ( {St,~,t,Sl,t,2,...,&,l,.,,, },{ Sl,ral,l,Sl,mt,2, ... Sl,ml,n, ~,1 } )i"{ }.
{ ...,s.,,..,..,.. } ) }where:p is the number of stacks;mi is the number of buffer ceils in stack i;and nld is the number of tree structures in the jthbuffer cell of stack i.The motivation for these data structures i given by thedesire for a completely unconstrained parsing algorithmupon which constraints may be placed.
This algorithmshould allow all possible parser operations to occur ateach parse state.
There are only two parser operations:attaching a node to another node and pushing abuffer cellonto a stack.
In order to allow both of these operations tobe performed in parallel, it is necessary to have the givendata structures: the buffer and the stack-set.2.1 Node AttachmentI assume a hypothesis-driven node projection algorithmof the following form.
In order to satisfy X Theory (Jack-endoff (1977), Chomsky (1986b)), a maximal projectionis constructed for each of a word's lexical entries whenthat word is input.
For each of these structures, the lexi-cal requirements and category of the structure causes tilelocal prediction to the right of further categories.
Thesepredicted structures are called hypothesized nodes or H-nodes.
All other structures are called confirmed nodesor C-nodes.
For example, when the noun dog is input, aconfirmed noun phrase and a h~pothesized clausal phraseare among the structures built: ~plying the methodology described here to the Projection Princi-ple as well as the 0-Criterion.
While the effects reported in thecurlier paper still hold, many additional results are obtained andreported here,5A noun phrase is projected to an H~node clausal (or predbcate) phrase since nouns may be the subjects of predicates.
(5) ao \[NV\[te, INdog \]\]1b.
\[xv,~ \[tee ~, \[te dog \]\]\] [x~ \[X,~.~ e \]\]\]Node attachment in this framework consists of match-ing hypothesized nodes on top of a stack in the stack-setagainst nodes in the buffer.
If the features of two suchnodes are compatible, then an attachment t~es place, theresult being the unification of the stack and buffer nodes.Since attachment always involves matching an It-node,?
all obligatory arguments are projected as H-nodes.3 Dynamic  App l i ca t ion  o f  the  0 -Cr i te r ionand  Pro jec t ion  Pr inc ip leFollowing much current work in syntactic theory, I as-sume that the grammar consists of a set of environmentswhere properties such as thematic role and Case may beassigned, along with a set of filters, each of which rulesout representations lacking a necessary property.
Thisapproach to syntactic theory has been labeled the Princi-ples and Parameters Approach (PPA) (Chomsky (1986a)).The particular syntactic theory that I will assume is knownas Government and Binding theory (see Chomsky, (1981,1986a, 1986b) along with the references cited in each),although the methodology of this work will apply to anysyntactic theory of this form.A filter-based syntactic theory presents an obvious setof candidate.s for load-bearing structural properties: theset of local violations of all syntactic filters.
That is,given a constraint-based syntactic theory, it is reasonableto assume that there is a processing load associated withthe local violation of each syntactic filter.
In particular,I will consider the 0-Criterion and Projection Principlefrom Government and Binding Theory with respect to atheory of processing.
These principles are given in (6)and (7):(6) The Projection Principle:Lexieal requirements must be satisfied at all levels ofrepresentation.
(paraphrased from Chomsky (1981) p.29).
6(7) The 0-Criterion:Each argument bears one and only one 0-role (thematicrole) and each 0-role is assigned to one and only oneargument (Chomsky (1981) p. 36).Note that the second part of the 0-Criterion- that each0-role be assigned- Iollows from the Projection Principle.Thus the 0-Criterion that I will assume consists only ofthe first clause of (7):(8) The 0-Criterion (simplified):Each argument bears one and only one 0-role.
"file dynamically applied 0-Criterion can be stated asthe following processing property:(9) The Property of Thematic Reception (~I'R):Associate a load of x'cn PLUs of short term memory toeach constituent that is in a position that can receive athematic role in some co-existing structure, but whose 0-assigner is not unambiguously identifiable in the structurein question.6Government and Binding Theory assumes tile existcnce of anumber of levels of representation, I assume that he level mostrelevant to parsing is surface structure or S..slructure.
Thus theProjection F'rinciple applied to S-structure dictates flint lexicalrequiremenks besatisfied at that level.2 115The dynamically applied Projection Principle gives asimilar property.
This property is stated in terms ofthematic elements.
Following early work in linguistictheory, I distinguish two kinds of categories: functionalcategories and thematic or content categories (see, forexample, Fukui and Speas (1986) and Abney (1987) andthe references cited in each).
Thematic ategories includenouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions; functional cate-gories include determiners, complementizers, and inflec-tion markers.
I hypothesiz~ that thematic elements aremore visible to the parser than their functional counter-parts.
This assumption ismade explicit in the Property ofLexical Requirement, the dynamic version of the Projec-tion Principle:(10) The Property of Lexical Requirement (PLR):Associate a load of xt~ PLUs of short term memory toeach lexical requirement that is satisfied by a hypothesizedconstituent containing no thematic elements.Note that all lexical requirements minimally involve theexistence of a hypothesized structure.
Thus the Propertyof Lexical Requirement ignores those structures whoselexical requirements are satisfied by either confirmednodes or hypothesized nodes that contain thematic el-ements.
The PLR will penalize only those structureswith unsatisfied lexical requirements, where unsatisfiedrequirements consist of thematic element-less hypothe-sized structures.When particular processing loads are associated witheach of these properties, they will make a large numberof empirical predictions in the theory of overload andpreference.
Since both the PTR and the PLR are prop-erties dealing with the interpretation f an utterance, it isreasonable to assume as a default hat the loads associ-ated with these two properties, XTR PLUs and xt~ PLUsrespectively, are the same.
7(11) xTe = x~ = xt~tIt turns out that this a~ssumption is consistent with allinequalities that are obtained in this paper.4 Ambiguity and the Properties ofThematic Reception and LexicalRequirementIn order to determine what load is associated with eachof the Properties of Thematic Reception and Lexical Re-quirement, I will first examine locally ambiguous en-tences that either cause or do not cause garden-path ef-fects.
Consider sentence (12) with respect to the ~ andPLR:(12) John expected Mary to like Fred.The verb expect is ambiguous: either taking an NPcomplement as in the sentence John expected Mary ortaking an IP complement asin (12).
8 Thus there is a localambiguity in (12) at the point of parsing the NP Mary.7In fact, both the 0-Criterion and the Projection Principleare generally believed to follow from a more general principle:that of Full Interpretation (Chomsky (1986a)).
If this is so, thenthe PLR and the PTR reduce to a single property: that of localuninterpretability.
However, the principle of Full Interpretationhas not yet been adequately formalized.
Thus I will continue toappeal only to its components.8Following current notation in GB Theory, IP=S and CP=S'(Chomsky (1986b)).Despite this local ambiguity, there is no difficulty parsing(12).
Consider the state of the parse of (12) after the wordMary has been processed:(13) a.
\[m\[Ne John \] \[re expected Lvp Mary \]\]\]b.
\[m Lvp John \] \[vp expected \[m \[UP Mary \] \]\]\]In (13a) the NP Mary is attached as the NP comple-ment of expected.
In this representation there is no loadassociated with either of the Properties of Thematic Re-ception or Lexical Requirement since all constituents hatare positions to receive thematic roles, do so, and all lex-ical requirements are satisfied.
In (13b) the NP Mary isthe specifier of a hypothesized IP node which is attachedas the complement of the other eading of expected.
Thisrepresentation is associated with at least xvn PLUs (= xlntPLUs) since the NP Mary is in a position that can be asso-ciated with a thematic role (the subject position), but doesnot yet receive one in this structure.
No load is associatedwith the Property of Lexical Requirement, however, sincethe lexical requirements of the verb expected are satisfiedby nodes that contain thematic elements.
Since there isno difficulty in processing sentence (12), the load differ-ence between these two structures cannot be greater thanP PLUs, the preference factor assumed in inequality (2).Thus the inequality in (14) is obtained:(14)Xlnt < PSince the load difference between the two structures inot sufficient to cause a strong preference, both structuresare maintained.
Note that this is a crucial difference be-tween the theory presented here and the theory presentedin Frazier & Fodor (1978), Fr~ier (1979) and Pritchett(1988).
In each of these theories, only one representationcan be maintained, so that either (13a) or (13b) would bepreferred at this point.
In order to account for the lackof difficulty in parsing (12), Pritchett assumes that back-tracking in certain situations is not expensive.
No suchstipulation is necessary in the framework given here.Now consider a second locally ambiguous .,;entence,one that results in a garden-path effect: 9(15) # i put the candy on the table in my mouth.Sentence (15) is locally ambiguous at the point of pars-ing the word on.
This preposition may attach as eitheran argument of the verb put, or as a modifier of the nountable.
The argument attachment is locally preferred, al-though it turns out that this attachment is not compatiblewith the rest of the sentence.
Thus a garden-path effectresults.
In order to see how the Properties of ThematicReception and Lexical Requirement can account for thisgarden-path effect, consider the state of the parse after theword on has been input:(16) a.
\[m \[up I \] \[vP Iv, \[v put \] \[NP the candy \] \[ee onbe 1\] \]\]1b.
\[m Jut, I \] \[vt, \[v, Iv put \] Ira, the candy b,e on \[up1\]\] 1\]The load associated with structure (16a) is xt~ PLUssince, although the lexical requirements of the verb putare satisfied, the lexical requirements of the preposition onremain unsatisfied.
On the other hand, the load associatedwith the modifier attachment is 2xt~ + XTR PLUs since 1)both the verb put and the preposition on have unsatisfied9I will prefix sentences that are difficult o parse because ofmemory limitations with the symbol "#".
Hence sentences thatare unacceptable due to processing overload will be prefixedwith "#", as will be garden-path sentences.116 3lexical requirements and 2) the PP headed by on receives athematic role in the argument attachment s ructure, whileit receives no such role in the current structure.
Ttlusthe diffcrencc between the loads associated with the twostructures is XLR + xrn PLUs = 2xt, t PLUs.
Since theargument attachment s ructure is strongly preferred overthe other structure, 1hypothesize that this load is greaterthan P PLUs:(I 7) 2x~,,t > PNow consider the well-known garden-path sentence in(18) (Bever (1970)):(18) # The horse raced past the barn fell.The structure for the input the horse raced is ~unbiguousbetween at least the two structures in (19):(19) a. be \[~p the horse \] \[vP raced \]lb.
\[m ~e the IN, \[IV, horse/\] \[cp Oi raced \] \]\] \]Structure (19a) has no load associated with it due to ei-ther the PLR or the PTR.
Crucially note that the verb racedhas an intransitive reading so that no load is required viathe Property of Lexical Requirement.
On the other hand,structure (19b) requircs a load of 2XT.~ PLUs since 1) thenoun phrase the horse is in a position that can receive athematic role, but currently does not and 2) the operatorO~ is in a position that may be associated with a the-matte role, but is not yet associated with one.
t?
Thus filedifference between the processing loads associated withstructures (19a) and (19b) is 2x~ PLUs = 2xl~t PLUs.
Bythe inequality in (17), this difference is sufficient to causethe preference of the less expensive structure.
Hence thegarden-path effect in (18) is predicted.Consider (20), a sentence whose structure and localambiguities are very similar to those in (18):(20) The bird found in the room was dead.Although the structures and local ambiguities in (20)and (18) are similar, (18) causes a garden-path effectwhile, surprisingly, (20) does not.
To determine why(20) is not a garden-path sentence we need to cxamine thelocal ambiguity when the word found is read:(21) a.
\[)e \[UP tile bird \] \[vp Iv, \[v found IN?
\] \]\]\]\]b.
\[0, \[NV tile \[~v' Dr, bird/\] \[cp Oi found \] \]\] \]The crucial difference between the verb found andthe verb raced is that found obligatorily requires a nounphrase object, while raced does not.
Since the lexical re-quirements of the verb found are not yet satisfied in struc-ture (21a), this representation is associated with xt~ PLUsof mcmory load.
Like structure (19b), structure (21b) re-quires 2x~8 PLUs.
Thus the difference between the pro-cessing loads of structures (21a) and (21b) is 2x,rt?
- x~PLUs = xtm PLUs.
By the result obtained from sentence(12), this load difference is not sufficient o force a strongpreference.
"Ilms the lack of garden-path effect in (20)is explained.
Furthermore, these results correctly predictthat sentence (22) is not a garden-path sentence ither:(22) Tile bird found in the room enough debris to build anest.Consider now (23):(23) # I believe that John smokes annoys Mary.1?In fact, this operator will be associated with a thematic roleas soon as a gap-positing algorithm links it with the object ofthe passive participle raced.
However, when the attachment isinitially made, no such link yet exists: the operator will initiallybe unassociated with a thematic role.When the complementiz~e?
that is input~ it c~n~ attachas either the argument of the verb believe or as subject ofbelieve's complement clause.
"File argument attachmentis strongly prefen'ed and a garden-path effect results in(23), since it is the other reading that is necessary for asuccessful parse.
Consider the slate of the parse ,after theword that has been input:(24) a.
\[re Me 1 \] \[vP believe \[ce \[c, \[c that lie \] \]\] \]\]\]b.
Ire Eve I \] \[v?
believe \[ce \[c, \[c e \] \[m \[cP that \[m\]\]\] 1\] \]\]Consider first structure (24a).
All positions that canreceive thematic roles, do so.
Thus there is no load asso-ciated with (24a) with respect to the Property of ThematicReception.
However tile complementizer that requiresan IP complement, so that x~ PLUs are associated with(24a).
Consider now (24b).
First of all, the CP headed bythat is in thematic role receiving position, but it does notyet receive a thematic role.
Thus (24b) is associated withat least xT~ PLUs.
Furthermore, both the lexical com-plementizer that and the argument non-lexical comple-mentizer of believe have lexical requirements hat mustbe satisfied, but as yet are unsatisfied.
Thus structure(24b) is associated with an additional 2xt~ PLUs via theProperty of Lexical Requirement.
Thus the total load as-sociated with structure (24b) is xrR + 2x~ PLUs.
Hencethe difference between the loads of the structures in (24)is x~q?
+ x~ PLUs = 2Xln t PLUs.
As we have seen ear-.lier, this load difference is sufficient for a preference tooccur.
Thus the garden-path effect in (23) is predicted, asdesired.See Gibson (1990) for explanations of further garden-path effects inside a similar framework.5 Processing Overload and the Propertiesof Thematic Reception and LexicalRequirementThe Properties of Thematic Reception and Lexical Re-quirement also give a plausible account of unacceptabilitydue to processing overload.
Recall that I assmne that asentence is unacceptable because of short term memoryoverload if the combination of memory associated withproperties of the structures built at some stage of the parseof the sentence is greater than the allowable processingload K. Consider the unacceptable c nter-embedding sen-tences in (25):(25) a.
# The man that the woman that won the race likeseats fish.b.
# The man that the woman that the dog bit likeseats fish.Consider one structure that results from parsing eitherof the sentences in (25) after the second complemeutizerthat has been input:(26) Ire Lye tile Lv, \[N' mani \] \[cP \[Ne Oi \] that \[m \[m, theIN' ~ '  womanj \] Ice \[Ne Oj \] that \[m \]\] \]\]\]\] \]\]\]First consider (26) with respect to the Property of Theematic Reception.
There are two lexical noun phrases in(26) that need thematic roles but lack them.
Furthermore,there are two non-lexical NPs, operators, that are in posi-tions that may prospectively be linked to thematic roles.Thus the load associated with (26) is at least 4x~R PLUS.Now consider (26) with respect to the Property of LexicalRequirement.
Only the two complementizers have lexic~d4 I17requirements in (26), and only the most recent of these isunsatisfied, since the lexical requirements of the first aresatisfied by a hypothesized node with thematic ontent.Thus the total oad associated with (26) is 4xrR +xt~ PLUS= 5xtnt PLUs.
I hypothesize that this load is too much forthe limited capacity of working memory:Indeed, when noun phrases with two levels of center-embedded relative clauses appear post-verbally, the re-suits are still unacceptable, although perhaps better:(27) a.
?# I saw the man that the woman that won therace likes.b.
# I saw the man that the woman that the dog bitlikes.Since the NP the man receives a thematic role as soonas it is parsed, it does not contribute to the processingload in either of the sentences in (27).
However, otherfactors in determining the maximal processing load of thesentences in (27) remain the same.
Thus the maximalload in each of (27a) and (27b) is 4xt~t PLUs.
Since eachof these sentences i  unacceptable, I hypothesize that thisload is more than can be handled by the short erm memorycapacity:(28) 4xlnt > KNote that sentences with only one relative clause mod-ifying a subject NP are acceptable, as is exemplified in(29)(29) The man that Mary likes eats fish.Since (29) is acceptable, its load is below the maximumat all stages of its processing.
Under the assumptions pre-sented in this paper, the processing load associated with(29) will be greatest when the complementizer that is in-put.
At this pointin the parse, there will be one lexical NP,the man, and one non-lexical NP, an operator, that requirethematic roles but currently lack them.
Furthermore, thecomplementizer that requires a complement IP which isnot yet present.
Thus the total load associated with (29)at the point of parsing that is 3xtnt PLUs.
11 Since there isno difficulty in parsing (29), we arrive at the inequality in(30):(30) 3xt~t < KThus I assume that the maximum processing load thatpeople can handle lies above 3xtnt PLUs but below 4xt~tPLUs.
Further data support this conclusion.
Forexample,consider the contrast between the sentences in (3 lb):(31) a.
That John smokes annoys me.b.
# That for John to smoke would annoy me isobvious.Although it is possible for a clause to be subject ofa matrix clause, as in (31a), an unacceptable s ntenceresults when the subject clause contains afurther clause asits subject, as in (3 Ib).
The acceptability of (3 la) togetherwith the unacceptability of (3 lb) can be easily explainedin the framework offered here.
Consider first sentence(31a).
The maximal processing load associated with theparse of (31a) occurs as the words that and John areprocessed.
In both of these states the load is 2xt~t PLUs,less than the available memory capacity.
Thus there is no~In fact, the load remains at 3x~ PLUs when the NP Maryis input: the NP Mary requires a thematic role, thus adding tothe processing load, but the lexical requirements of the com-plementizer that also become satisfied at this point, since athematic element, Mary, is now present in the hypothesized IPcomplement.difficulty in the processing of (31a).
Consider, however,the state of the parse of (31b) after the complementizerfor has been input:(32) \[tp \[ce that \[tp \[ce for \[m \]\] \]\] \]There are two complementizer phrases, both in the-matic positions, which currently lack thematic roles.
Fur-thermore, both complementizers have lexical require-ments that are currently unsatisfied: that is, the comple-ment of each complementizer neither contains athematicelement nor is a confirmed node.
Thus the total load as-sociated with (32) is 4Xlnt PLUs, which is enough ~o forceprocessing overload.
Thus the unacceptability of (32) isexplained.Furthermore, the acceptability of (33) comes as no sur-prise to the account presented here:(33) I believe that for John to smoke would annoy me.In contrast to (31b), the first complementizer in (33)receives a thematic role as soon as it is processed.
Thusthe maximal processing load associated with the parse of(33) is only 3xtnt PLUs, not enough to overload short ermmemory.5.1 Processing Overload: Cross-LinguisticPredictionsThe examples discussed thus far are all English ones.
Astrong test of the theory presented here is presented bydata from other languages.
First let us consider center-embeddexl relative clauses in languages closely related toEnglish.
In particular, consider Dutch and German.
Itturns out that multiply center-embedded r lative clausesbecome difficult in these languages at the stone point asthey do in English: on the second embedding.
For ex-ample, the German sentence (34) is unacceptable, asex-pected:(34) # Der Mann den die Frau die der Hund bib sahschwam.
"The man that the woman that the dog bit saw swam.
"Unlike English, however, German and Dutch are verbfinal in subordinate clauses, so that verbs with lexical re-quirements for three thematic elements pose an interestingtest to the theory.
If the theory presented here is correctand it generalizes cross-linguistically, then constructionswith three initial 0-role-requiring constituents should beacceptable.
It turns out that this is in fact the case, as theGerman example (35) illustrates:(35) Ich glaube, dab John Mary das Geschenk gegebenhat.I believe that John Mary the present given has"I believe that John has given Mary the present.
"After the word Geschenk, there are three noun phrasesthat require thematic roles, but currently lack them.
Alllexical requirements are satisfied at this point in the parse,so the total load associated with this parse state is 3x~tPLUs.
Thus (35) is predicted to acceptable, as desired.Another good test for the theory presented here comesfrom cross-serial dependencies in Dutch.
12 In examplesof cross-serial dependency, noun phrase arguments ap-pear at the beginning of a subordinate clause, followedby their thematic role assigning verbs.
It turns out that12See Bresnan et al(1982) for a discussion of the syntax ofsuch constructions.118 5constructions with three initial noun phrases are perfex;tlyacceptable, asis exemplified in (36):(36) ... (hat Jan Piet de kinderen zag helpen zwemmen.... that Jan Pier the children saw help swim"... tlutt Jan saw Piet help the children swim?
'However, these constructions lose their acceptabilitywith rite addition of further NP arguments:(37) a..9# ... dat Jan Piet Marie de kinderen zag helpenlaten zwemmen.... that Jan Piet Marie the children saw help makeswim"... that Jan saw Piet help Made make the childrenswim."b.
# ... dat Jan Piet Marie Karel de kinderen zaghelpen laten leren zwemmen.... that Jan Pier Marie the children saw help maketeach swim"... that Jan saw Piet help Marie make Karel teachthe children to swim.
"This result is predicted in the fraruework presentedhere.
Four NP arguments locally lacking thematic rolesforce a load of 4xtnt, too much for human short erm mem-ory capacity.Evidence from the processing of Japanese also supportsthe memory capacity results obtained here.
Japanese isa verb final language, so that subjects and objects appearbefore the verb.
Verbs that lake clausal complementsprovide an interesting test case for the theory presentedhere, since it is grammatical to place all NP argumentsbefore the thematic role assigning verbs.
For example,consider (38):(38) Jon wa Fred ga Biru we sukida to omotteiru.John TOPIC Fred NOM Bill ACe likes COMP thinks"John thinks tlmt Fred likes Bill"Sentence (38) is perfectly acceptable, as is predictedby the theory presented here.
The processing load asso-ciated with (38) peaks at the point that the NP Biru isinput: at this point there are three NP arguments whichrequire thematic roles but currently lack them.
As a result,the processing load associated with this processing stateis 3xtnt PLUs, not enough to cause overload.
However,when more than three NP arguments appear sentence ini-tially, acceptability is lost, as predicted by the processingoverload results obtained here:(39) a.
?# Jon wa Mary ga Fred ga Biru we sukida tosinjiteiru to omotteiru.John TOPIC Mary NOM Fred NOM Bill ACC likesCOMP believes COMP thinks"John thinks that Mary believes that Fred likesBill."b.
# Jon wa Mary ga Fred ga Sam ga Biru we sukidato omotteiru to sinjiteiru to omotteiru.John TOPIC Mary NOM Fred NOM Sam NOMBill ^cc likes COMP thinks COMP believes COMPthinks"John thinks that Mary believes that Fred thinksthat Sam likes Bill.
"6 ConclusionsSince the structural properties that are used in the for-mation of the inequalities are independently motivated,and the system of inequalities i solvable, the tllex)13r ofhuman sentence processing presented here makes strong,testable predictions with respect to the prtu=essability ofagiven sentence.
Fm~thermore, the success of the methodprovides empirical support for the particular propertiesused in the formation of the inequalities.
~\[hus a theoryof PLUs, the preference I~lctor P mid file overload facetot K provides a unified account of 1) acceptability andrelative acceptability; 2) garden-path effects; and 3) pre~ferred readings for mnbiguous input and perception ofambiguity.7 AcknowledgementsI would like to thank my informants: Alex Franz, HiroakiKitano, Ingrid Meyer, Teruko Mitamura nd Michel Ned-erlof.
