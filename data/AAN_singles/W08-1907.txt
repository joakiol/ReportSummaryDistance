Our propo-sal relies crucially on two facts: That bothChinese and Japanese conventionally useChinese orthography in their respectivewriting systems, and that the Chineseorthography is anchored on a system ofradical parts which encodes basicconcepts.
Each orthographic unit, calledhanzi and kanji respectively, contains aradical which indicates the broad se-mantic class of the meaning of that unit.Our study utilizes the homomorphismbetween the Chinese hanzi and Japanesekanji systems to ide1ntify bilingual wordcorrespondences.
We use bilingual dictio-naries, including WordNet, to verifysemantic relation between the cross-lingual pairs.
These bilingual pairs arethen mapped to an ontology constructedbased on relations to the relation betweenthe meaning of each character and the?

Theconceptual structure of the radicalontology is proposed as a model forsimultaneous conceptual access to bothlanguages.
A study based on wordscontaining characters composed of the??(mouth)?
radical is given to illustratethe proposal and the actual model.
Thefact that this model works for twotypologically very different languagesand that the model contains generativelexicon like coersive links suggests thatthis model has the conceptual robustnessto be applied to other languages.1 MotivationComputational conceptual access to multilinguallexicon can be achieved through the use of ontol-ogy or WordNet as interlingual links.
Some lan-guages do conventionally encode semantic classi-fication information, such as the linguistic systemof classifiers or the orthographic system of cha-racters.
We attempt to make use of these implicit-ly encoded linguistic knowledge for conceptualaccess to lexical information.On the other hand, even though ontology seemsto be a natural choice for conceptual frameworkto access multilingual lexical information, thereis no large-scale implementation nor is there any47direct evidence for psychological reality of theframeworks of ontology.
Hence, we hope thatusing a conventionalized semantic classificationsystem will mitigate some of the problems andprovide the constructed ontology some motiva-tion since they are the shared and implicit con-ceptual systems.2 Background2.1.
Hanzi and kanji: Shared Orthography ofTwo Typologically Different LanguagesChinese and Japanese are two typologically dif-ferent languages sharing the same orthographysince they both use Chinese characters in writtentext.
What makes this sharing of orthographyunique among languages in the world is that Chi-nese characters (kanji in Japanese and hanzi inChinese) explicitly encode information of seman-tic classification (Xyu 121, Chou and Huang2005).
This partially explains the process of Jap-anese adopting Chinese orthography even thoughthe two languages are not related.
The adaptationis supposed to be based on meaning and not oncognates sharing some linguistic forms.
Howev-er, this meaning-based view of kanji/hanzi ortho-graphy faces a great challenge given the fact thatJapanese and Chinese form-meaning pair do nothave strict one-to-one mapping.
There are mean-ings instantiated with different forms, as well assame forms representing different meanings.
Thecharacter ?
is one of most famous faux amis.
Itstands for ?hot soup?
in Chinese and ?hot spring?in Japanese.
In sum, these are two languageswhere their forms are supposed to be organizedaccording to meanings, but show inconsistencies.It is important to note that WordNet andthe Chinese character orthography are not so dif-ferent as they appear.
WordNet assumes thatthere are some generalizations in how conceptsare clustered and lexically organized in languagesand propose an explicit lexical level representa-tion framework which can be applied to all lan-guages in the world.
Chinese character orthogra-phy intuited that there are some conceptual basesfor how meanings are lexicalized and organized,hence devised a sub-lexical level representationto represent semantic clusters.
Based on this ob-servation, the study of cross-lingual homo-formsbetween Japanese and Chinese in the context ofWordNet offers an unique window for differentapproaches to lexical conceptualization.
SinceJapanese and Chinese use the same character setwith the same semantic primitives (i.e.
radicals),we can compare their conceptual systems withthe same atoms when there are variations inmeanings of the same word-forms.
When this isoverlaid over WordNet, we get to compare theontology of the two represent systems.2.2.
Hantology and the Ontologization of theSemantic Classification of the RadicalsThe design of Hantology differs from otherword-based ontology.
A typical word-based on-tology is WordNet which describes the differentrelations among synonyms.
All of the relationsamong synonyms are based on the senses ofwords.
Therefore, WordNet only needs to takesenses into consideration.
Hantology is morecomplicated than WordNet because it describesorthographic forms, pronunciations, senses, va-riants, lexicalization, the spread of Chinese cha-racters and Japanese kanji.This approach can sys-tematically illustrate the development of Chinesewriting system (Chou et al 2007).Hantology also provides mapping with SinicaBOW(Academia Sinica Bilingual OntologicalWordNet).
Sinica BOW is a Chinese-EnglishOntology and have mapping with WordNet.Therefore, character-based and word-basedontologies are integrated to provide resourcesfrom character to word for Chinese languageprocessing.Figure 1.
The Mapping among Hantology,Sinica BOW and WordNetThe structure of Hantology is divided intothree parts: orthography, pronunciation, andlexicalization.The orthographic part of Hantology describes thestructure of characters, the principles offormatting characters, the evolution of script,Hantology(Chinese-Japanese charac-ter- based ontology)Sinica BOW(Chinese-English word-based ontology)WordNet48glyph expression, the relation of variant and thespread of Chinese characters.
(1) The structure of characters describes thecomponents of each hanzi/kanji, includingsemantic and phonetic symbols.
(2) The principles of formatting Chinesecharacters encode the classification of therelation used to compose the character from itscomponents: The pictographic characters wereformed by reformatting the pictures of concreteobjects.
The ideographic (zhi3shi4, refer-event)characters are formed by abstract representationof an concept.
The compound ideographiccharacters are formed by combining two (oremore) semantic symbols.
The semantic-phonetic (xing2sheng1) characters, representingover 90 percent of Chinese character, areformed by combining a semantic symbol and aphonetic symbol.
(3) The evolution of script illustrates thedifferent scripts of Chinese characters.
Thescript is a kind of writing style.
BecauseChinese characters have been used forthousands years, the scripts have changed.Theorthographic forms do not change with differentscripts.
Hantology provides Bronze, LesserSeal, Kaishu scripts to illustrate evolution ofChinese scripts used from 3000 years ago.
(4) Variants are the characters with differentorthographic forms with identical pronunciationand meaning.
For example, Chinese chara-cters?and ?are variants.
Variants relations arean important feature in Hantology, similar toWordNet synset relations.
(5) The contrasts between kanji and hanziglyphs are also encoded.
The Japanese languagecontinues to evolve and change after theadoption of Chinese characters.
Hence the kanjisystem includes both historical changes andcross-lingual variations.
The kanji system hasits own variants which are not necessarily thesame set of variants in the hanzi system.
Mostof Chinese characters adopted by simplifiedkanji are the variants already used in Chinese.For example, ???
is a simplified kanji of tradi-tional kanji ???.
In addition, Chinese character???
is also the variant of Chinese charac-ter???.
So, ???and???
both are variants inChinese and Japanese.
But, some simplifiedkanji are not variants used in Chinese.
Forexample, new kanji ???
is the variant of oldkanji ???
in Japan.
However, ???
is not thevariant of ???
in Chinese.The second reason of the kanji orthographicform to to be changed is that Japanese not onlyadopted Chinese characters but also have createdhundreds kanji known as Kokuji (??).
MostKokuji characters have only Japanese pronuncia-tions.
Some of Kokuji have been adopted in Chi-nese.
For example, Kokuji ??
?is also borrowedby Chinese.
The meaning of ???
is the same bothin Japanese and Chinese.3.
Preliminaries: Orthography basedMapping of Chinese and Japanese Words3.1 EDR Japanese-English DictionaryThe Japanese-English dictionary of EDR Elec-tronic Dictionary is a machine-tractable dictio-nary that contains the lexical knowledge of Japa-nese and English.1It contains list of 165,695 Jap-anese words (jwd) and each of their related in-formation.In this experiment, the English synset, definitionand the Part-of-Speech category (POS) of eachjwd are used to determine the semantic relations.We assume that the concept, synonyms, near-synonyms, and paraphrases are the synset of eachjwd.In the case when there is no English defini-tion for the word, we assume that there is noequivalent term in English, therefore we use theconcept definition of the jwd as its definition.3.2 SinicaBowIn the previous experiment, the CWN, whichcontains a list of 8,624 Chinese word (cwd) en-tries, was used as the cwd data, however sincethe number of cwds was too small, many jwdswere not mapped, even when there is actually acorresponding J-C word pairs exists.This time we adopt SinicaBow, which contains9,9642 entries, hoping to find more valid corres-ponding J-C word pairs.In SinicaBow, each entryis a definition and it contains one or more cwdscorresponds to the definition.In this experiment, the English synset, definitionand the POS of each cwd are used to determinethe semantic relations.3.3List of Kanji VariantsList of 125 pairs of manually matched Chineseand Japanese characters with variant glyph formsprovided by Kyoto University.1 http://www2.nict.go.jp/r/r312/EDR/index.html49Some Japanese kanji and Chinese hanzi haveidentical property but have different font and Un-icode.This resource contains list of Japanese kan-ji and Chinese hanzi pairs that the kanji proper-ties are exactly the same but the forms and theUnicode are different.During the mapping procedure, whenever a Japa-nese kanji and a Chinese hanzi being comparedare in the variant list and are the variants of eachother, they are considered to be the identical han-zi.3.4 Procedure3.4.1Kanji MappingEach jwd is mapped to the corresponding cwdaccording to their kanji similarity.Such mappingpairs are divided in to the following three groups:(1) Identical Kanji Sequence Pairs, where thenumbers of kanji in the jwd and cwd are identicaland the nth characters in the two words are alsoidentical.E.g.
?, ??
(2) Different Kanji Order Pairs, where the num-bers of kanji in the jwd and cwd are identical,and the kanji appear in the two words are identic-al, but the order is different.E.g.
Japanese  Chinese??
????
??
(3) Partially Identical Pairs, where at least halfkanji in the shorter word matches with the part ofthe longer word.In the case when the shorterword has 4 or less kanji, 2 of the kanji have to bein the longer word.In the case when the shorterword is only 1 kanji, the pair is not consi-dered.jwd matches with a kanji in the cwd.E.g.,  Japanese  Chinese???
???????????????
????
?etc?In the case no corresponding pair relation (one ofthe three groups explained above) is found for ajwd or a cwd, each word is classified to one ofthe following group(4) unmapped jwd is classified to an independentJapanese(5) unmapped cwd is classified to an independentChineseJ-C word pairs in such mapping groups are clas-sified in the following manner: (1) A jwd and acwd are compared.If the words are identical, thenthey are an identical kanji sequence pair.
(2) If thepair is found to be not an identical kanji sequencepair, check if the pair has identical kanji in dif-ferent order (equal length).If so, then they are adifferent kanji order pair.
(3) If the pair is foundto be not a different kanji order pair, then checkthe partial identity of the pair.Meanwhile, if theyare partially identical (according to the characte-ristics of partially identical pairs describedabove), the pair is classified to a partially identic-al pair.After the mapping process, if the jwd is notmapped to any of the cwd, the jwd is classified to(4) independent Japanese group.
If a cwd is notmapped by any of the jwd, it is classified to (5)independent Chinese group.The number of Japanese kanji- Chinese hanzipairs?

J-C Hanzi Similarity Distribution (Huang etal.
2008).3.4.2Finding Synonymous Relation (Word Re-lation)After the kanji mapping, each of (1) identicalkanji sequence pairs, (2) different kanji orderpairs and (3) partially identical pairs is dividedinto three subgroups;(1-1, 2-1, 3-1) Synonym pairs with identicalPOS: words in a pair are synonym with identicalPOS.E.g.
(1-1) ??
: singer (noun)(2-1) ???
(Japanese) and???
(Chinese):blue-violet color (noun)50(3-1) ???
(Japanese) and???
(Chinese):brown sugar (noun)(1-2, 2-2, 3-2) Synonym pairs with unmatchedPOS: words in a pair are synonym with differentPOS or POS of at least one of the words in thepair is missing.E.g.
(1-2) ?
:(Japanese) action of wrapping (noun)(Chinese) to wrap (verb)(2-2) ??
(Japanese): a cough (noun)??
(Chinese): cough (verb)(1-3, 2-3, 3-3) Relation Unidentified: the relationis not determinable by machine processing withthe given information at this point.E.g.
Japanese  Chinese(1-3) ?
: hot spring (noun) ?
: soup (noun)(2-3) ??
:    ??
: flowerarrangement (noun) peanut (noun)(3-3) ???
:   ???
:blue grapes (noun) Portugal (noun)In order to find the semantic relation of J-C wordpairs by machine analysis, the jwd and the cwd ina pair are compared according to the followinginformation:Jwd: English synset (jsyn), definition (jdef) andPOSCwd: English synset (csyn), definition (cdef) andPOSThe process of checking the synonymy of eachpair is done in the following manner:If any of the following conditions meets, we as-sume that the pair is a synonym pair:at least any one of the synonym from each of jsynand csyn are identicalat least one of the word definition contains a syn-onym of the other wordIf any synonym pair was found, check if the POSare identical.If the POS are identical, the pair isclassified to a synonym pair with identicalPOS.Otherwise the pair is classified to a syn-onym pair with non-identical POS.If the pair isnot a synonym pair then they are classified to arelation-unidentified pair.After the process, each of the subgroups is ma-nually examined to check the actual semanticrelations of each word pair.4.
Result4.1 Word Family as Domain Ontology Headedby a Basic ConceptChinese radical (yi4fu2, ideographs; semanticsymbols) system offers a unique opportunity forsystematic and comprehensive comparison be-tween formal and linguistic ontologies.
Chou andHuang (2005) suggests that the family of Chinesecharacters sharing the same radical can be linkedto a basic concept by Qualia relations.
Based onPustejovsky?s Quilia Structure [Pustejovsky,1995] and the original analysis of ?ShuoWen-JieXi?
[Xyu, 121], each radical group can be asdomain ontology headed by one basic concept.Chou and Huang (2005) assume that 540 radicalsin ?ShuoWenJieXi?
can each represent a basicconcept and that all derivative characters areconceptually dependent on that basic concept.Also, they hypothesis that a radical can be classi-fied into six main types: formal, constitutive, tel-ic, participating, descriptive (state, manner) andagentive.
Modes of conceptual extension capturethe generative nature of radical creativity.
Allderived characters are conceptually dependent onthe basic concept.
In their preliminary studies,word family could be headed by a basic conceptand also could be represented ontologies in OWLformat.4.2Data Analysis: Japanese and ChineseWords with Identical Orthography4.2.1 Kanji MappingWe present our study over Japanese and Chineselexical semantic relation based on the kanji se-quences and their semantic relations.We com-pared Japanese-English dictionary of ElectricDictionary Research (EDR) with the SinicaBowin order to examine the nature of cross-linguallexical semantic relations.Identical Different OrderPart Identic-alSynonym(IdenticalPOS)(1-1) 13610pairs(2-1) 567pairs(3-1) 37466pairsSynonym(UnmatchedPOS)(1-2) 2265pairs(2-2) 214pairs(3-2) 22734pairsRelation Un-identified(1-3) 21154pairs(2-3) 2336pairs(3-3)1116141pairsTotal(1) 37029pairs(2) 3117pairs(3)1176341pairs16950 jwds 1497 jwds 39821 jwds(4) Unmapped Japanese: 107427 jwds51(5) Unmapped Chinese: 41417 entriesTable 1.J-C Kanji Similarity DistributionThe next step is to find Synonymous Relation.

Partially Identical Pairs (1176341 pairs) Lexi-cal Semantic RelationSince each entry in SinicaBow corresponds to adefinition and each jwd has at least a definitionor a concept definition, no pairs with insufficientinformation to check the semantic relation wasfound.The data shows that as the word forms ofthe two languages are closer, the more synonymsare found.In order to confirm this observationand to see the actual semantic relation of eachpairs, we will continue with more detailed analy-sis.In addition, in order to pursue the further de-tails of the Japanese-Chinese words relation, wewill also analyze the semantic relations (not onlysynonymous relation) of the relation-unidentifiedpairs.4.2.2 ??

(mouth)?are se-lected.
In addition, if any character of the wordsowns the radical ??
(mouth)?, then it would beincluded here for anaylysing the detailed seman-tic relation between jwd and cwd..Second, we would like to define the semanticrelations of J-C word pairs in more details.
Weexamined the actual semantic relation of J-Cword pairs by by classifying into 8 semantic rela-tions and marked the relation into [ ] remark.1.[SYN](Synonym)2.[NSN](Near-Synonym)3.[HYP](Hypernym)4.[HPO](Hyponym)5.[HOL](Holonym)6.[MER](Meronym)7.

?>cdef]]52Sample:[(J)-[HYP]-(C)]@(J is the hypernym of C)The examples are shown here.
In each pair, wedefine the semantic relation between the jwd andthe cwd.
The mapping process would be as fol-lows.E.g1.

ConclusionAppendix A.
The Dimension of ??
(mouth) Conceptual extension?.The result of the experiment comparing the Japa-nese and Chinese words is to see their form-meaning similarities.Since the Japanese and theChinese writing system (kanji) and its semanticmeanings are near-related, analyzing such rela-tion may contribute to the future research relatedto Hantology.In this paper, we examine and ana-lyze the form of kanji and the semantic relationsbetween Japanese and Chinese.This paper de-scribes the structure of Hantology which is a cha-racter-based bilingual ontology for Chinese andJapanese.
Hantology represents orthographicforms, pronunciations, senses, variants, lexicali-zation, the spread and relation between Chinesecharacters and Japanese kanji.
The results showHantology has two implications.
First, Hantologyprovides the resources needed by Chinese lan-guage processing for computers.Second, Hantol-ogy provides a platform to analyze the variationand comparison of Chinese characters and kanjiuse.ReferencesChou, Ya-Min and Chu-Ren Huang.
