Achilles: NiCT/ATR Chinese Morphological Analyzer for the Fourth SighanBakeoffRuiqiang Zhang1,2 and Eiichiro Sumita1,21National Institute of Information and Communications Technology2ATR Spoken Language Communication Research Laboratories2-2-2 Hikaridai, Seiika-cho, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, 619-0288, Japan{ruiqiang.zhang,eiichiro.sumita}@atr.jpAbstractWe created a new Chinese morpholog-ical analyzer, Achilles, by integratingrule-based, dictionary-based, and statis-tical machine learning method, condi-tional random fields (CRF).
The rule-based method is used to recognize regularexpressions: numbers, time and alphabets.The dictionary-based method is used tofind in-vocabulary (IV) words while out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are detectedby the CRFs.
At last, confidence measurebased approach is used to weigh all the re-sults and output the best ones.
Achilleswas used and evaluated in the bakeoff.We participated the closed tracks of wordsegmentation and part-of-speech taggingfor all the provided corpus.
In spite ofan unexpected file encoding errors, thesystem exhibited a top level performance.A higher word segmentation accuracy forthe corpus ckip and ncc were achieved.We are ranked at the fifth and eighth po-sition out of all 19 and 26 submissionsrespectively for the two corpus.
Achillesuses a feature combined approach for part-of-speech tagging.
Our post-evaluation re-sults prove the effectiveness of this ap-proach for POS tagging.1 IntroductionMany approaches have been proposed in Chineseword segmentation in the past decades.
Segmen-tation performance has been improved significantly,from the earliest maximal match (dictionary-based)approaches to HMM-based (Zhang et al, 2003) ap-proaches and recent state-of-the-art machine learn-ing approaches such as maximum entropy (Max-Ent) (Xue and Shen, 2003), support vector ma-chine (SVM) (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001), con-ditional random fields (CRF) (Peng and McCallum,2004), and minimum error rate training (Gao et al,2004).
After analyzing the results presented in thefirst and second Bakeoffs, (Sproat and Emerson,2003) and (Emerson, 2005), we created a new Chi-nese word segmentation system named as ?Achilles?that consists of four modules mainly: Regular ex-pression extractor, dictionary-based Ngram segmen-tation, CRF-based subword tagging (Zhang et al,2006), and confidence-based segmentation.
Of thefour modules, the subword-based tagging, differingfrom the existing character-based tagging, was pro-posed in our work recently.
We will give a detail de-scription to this approach in the following sections.In the followings, we illustrate our word seg-mentation process in Section 2, where the subword-based tagging is implemented by the CRFs method.Section 3 illustrates our feature-based part-of-speech tagging approach.
Section 4 presents our ex-perimental results.
Section 5 describes current state-of-the-art methods for Chinese word segmentation.Section 6 provides the concluding remarks.2 Introduction of main modules inAchillesThe process of Achilles is illustrated in Fig.

An ex-ample exhibiting each step?s results is also given inthe figure.The rule-based regular expression is not shown inthe figure because this module interweaves with theother modules.
This module can be called if neededat any time.
The function of this module is to recog-nize numerical, temporal expression and others likeproduct number, telephone number, credit numberor alphabets.
For example, ?????(35,000)?,???
(August)?, ?0774731301?, ?George Bush?.2.1 Dictionary-based N-gram wordsegmentationDictionary-based N-gram word segmentation is animportant module for Achilles.
This module canachieve a very high R-iv, but no OOV detection.We combined with it the N-gram language model(LM) to solve segmentation ambiguities.

law in the above derivation.Because the word sequence must keep consistentwith the character sequence, P(C|W) is expandedto be a multiplication of a Kronecker delta functionseries, ?
(u, v), equal to 1 if both arguments are thesame and 0 otherwise.Equation 1 indicates the process of dictionary-based word segmentation.
We looked up the lexiconto find all the IVs, and evaluated the word sequenceswith the LMs.2.2 Subword-based IOB tagging using CRFsIf dictionary-based module recognizes IVs success-fully, the subword-based IOB tagging can recog-nize OOVs.
Before the subword-based tagging,the character-based ?IOB?
tagging approach hasbeen widely used in Chinese word segmentationrecently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCal-lum, 2004; Tseng et al, 2005).
Under the scheme,each character of a word is labeled as ?B?
if it isthe first character of a multiple-character word, or?O?
if the character functions as an independentword, or ?I?
otherwise.?
For example, ??(whole)???
(Beijing city)?
is labeled as ??(whole)/O?(north)/B?(capital)/I?
(city)/I?.We proposed the subword-based tagging (Zhanget al, 2006) to improve the existing character-basedtagging.
The subword-based IOB tagging assignstags to a pre-defined lexicon subset consisting ofthe most frequent multiple-character words in addi-tion to single Chinese characters.
If only Chinesecharacters are used, the subword-based IOB taggingis downgraded into a character-based one.
Takingthe same example mentioned above, ??(whole)???
(Beijing city)?
is labeled as ??
(whole)/O ??(Beijing)/B?(city)/I?
in the subword-based tag-ging, where ???(Beijing)/B?
is labeled as oneunit.We used the CRFs approach to train the IOB tag-ger (Lafferty et al, 2001) on the training data.
We179Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processingdownloaded and used the package ?CRF++?
fromthe site ?http://www.chasen.org/t?aku/software.?
Ac-cording to the CRFs, the probability of an IOB tagsequence, T = t0t1 ?
?
?
tM, given the word sequence,W = w0w1 ?
?
?wM, is defined byp(T |W) =exp????????M?i=1????????
?k?k fk(ti?1, ti,W) +?k?kgk(ti,W)????????????????
/Z,Z =?T=t0t1??
?tMp(T |W)(2)where we call fk(ti?1, ti,W) bigram feature functionsbecause the features trigger the previous observa-tion ti?1 and current observation ti simultaneously;gk(ti,W), the unigram feature functions because theytrigger only current observation ti.
?k and ?k arethe model parameters corresponding to feature func-tions fk and gk respectively.The model parameters were trained by maximiz-ing the log-likelihood of the training data using L-BFGS gradient descent optimization method.
Inorder to overcome overfitting, a gaussian prior wasimposed in the training.The types of unigram features used in our experi-ments included the following types:w0,w?1,w1,w?2,w2,w0w?1,w0w1,w?1w1,w?2w?1,w2w0where w stands for word.
The subscripts are po-sition indicators.
0 means the current word; ?1,?2,the first or second word to the left; 1, 2, the first orsecond word to the right.For the bigram features, we only used the previ-ous and the current observations, t?1t0.As to feature selection, we simply used absolutecounts for each feature in the training data.
We de-fined a cutoff value for each feature type and se-lected the features with occurrence counts over thecutoff.A forward-backward algorithm was used in thetraining and viterbi algorithm was used in the de-coding.2.3 Confidence-dependent word segmentationBefore moving to this step in Figure 1, we producedtwo segmentation results: the one by the dictionary-based approach and the one by the IOB tagging.However, neither was perfect.
The dictionary-basedsegmentation produced results with higher R-ivs butlower R-oovs while the IOB tagging yielded the con-trary results.
In this section we introduce a con-fidence measure approach to combine the two re-sults.
We define a confidence measure, CM(tiob|w),to measure the confidence of the results producedby the IOB tagging by using the results fromthe dictionary-based segmentation.
The confidencemeasure comes from two sources: IOB tagging anddictionary-based word segmentation.
Its calculationis defined as:CM(tiob|w) = ?CMiob(tiob|w) + (1 ?
?)?
(tw, tiob)ng(3)where tiob is the word w?s IOB tag assigned by theIOB tagging; tw, a prior IOB tag determined by theresults of the dictionary-based segmentation.
Afterthe dictionary-based word segmentation, the wordsare re-segmented into subwords by FMM before be-ing fed to IOB tagging.
Each subword is given aprior IOB tag, tw.
CMiob(t|w), a confidence probabil-ity derived in the process of IOB tagging, is definedasCMiob(t|wi) =?T=t0t1??
?tM ,ti=t P(T |W,wi)?T=t0t1??
?tM P(T |W)where the numerator is a sum of all the observationsequences with word wi labeled as t.?
(tw, tiob)ng denotes the contribution of thedictionary-based segmentation.
It is a Kroneckerdelta function defined as?
(tw, tiob)ng = { 1 if tw = tiob0 otherwiseIn Eq.
3, ?
is a weighting between the IOB tag-ging and the dictionary-based word segmentation.We found the value 0.7 for ?, empirically.By Eq.
3 the results of IOB tagging were re-evaluated.
A confidence measure threshold, t, wasdefined for making a decision based on the value.If the value was lower than t, the IOB tag was re-jected and the dictionary-based segmentation wasused; otherwise, the IOB tagging segmentation wasused.
A new OOV was thus created.
For the twoextreme cases, t = 0 is the case of the IOB taggingwhile t = 1 is that of the dictionary-based approach.In a real application, a satisfactory tradeoff between180Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language ProcessingR-ivs and R-oovs could find through tuning the con-fidence threshold.3 Part-of-speech TaggingOur POS tagging is a traditional maximum entropytagging (A.Ratnaparkhi, 1996) as follows,p(t|h) = 1Z(h)exp(M?i=1?i fi(h, t)) (4)where Z(h) is a normalizing factor determined byrequirement ?t p(t|h) = 1 over all t:Z(h) =?texp(M?i=1?i fi(h, t)) (5)In the evaluation, 17 categories of triggers wereused, which include:(w, t) , (w?2w?1w, t) , (w?1ww1, t) , (ww1w2, t) ,(w?1w, t) , (ww1, t) , (t?1, t) , (t?2t?1, t) , (t?1w1, t),(t?1ww1, t), (w?1w1, t) , (w?1, t) , (w1, t) , (t?1w, t),(t?2t?1w, t) , (w?2w?1, t) , (w1w2, t)where:w is the word whose tag we are predicting; t is thetag we are predicting; t?1 is the tag to the left of tagt; t?2 is the tag to the left of tag t?1; w?1 is the wordto the left of word w; w?2 is the word to the left ofword w?1; w1 is the word to the right of word w; w2is the word to the right of word w1 ;In addition to the ME based POS tagging ap-proach, we also combined a N-gram based POS tag-ging.N-gram tagger is the most widely used tagger inpart-of-speech tagging methods.
The basic idea isto maximize a posterior probability p(T |W) given aword sequence in order to find its tag sequence.
Byusing Bayes rule, this can be transformed as to max-imize p(T ) ?
p(W |T ).
Prior probability p(T ) is a N-gram language model of tag sequence.
p(W |T ) isthought as an unigram model.
In this experiment weused trigram to model p(T ).Differing from the interpolation smoothing al-gorithm used in(Merialdo, 1994), both p(T ) andp(W |T ) were smoothed by back-off methods(Katz,1987).
Because a N-gram backoff model P(T ) iswell-known, a backoff implementation of p(W |T )was given here only.

Ourscores should have achieved better than the officialnumbers if we had submitted the results in the rightformat.
Achilles outputs results in GBK/BIG5 for-mat.
However, the format determined by bakeofforganizers is Unicode-16.
We made a lethal er-ror when we converted the files from GBK/BIG5to Unicode-16.
Hence, the official results displaywrong scores for our system?s results.We evaluated our results again in the post-evaluation.
The results for word segmentation isshown in Table 1.
The results for POS tagging isshown in Table 2.Table 1 and Table 2 represent the real perfor-mance of Achilles in this evaluation.

IV recogni-tion can be solved at higher accuracy by dictionary-based approach.
OOV recognition can be solvedby IOB tagging.
However, the flexible numericaland temporal expression cannot be solved by theabove two methods.
Hence, we used regular expres-sion.
Finally, the inconsistency of the above meth-ods are resolved by confidence measure approach.These features causes higher performance achievedby Achilles.6 ConclusionsThis paper described systematically the main fea-tures of our Chinese morphological analyzer,Achilles.
Because of its delicate design and state-of-the-art technological integration, Achilles achievedbetter or comparable segmentation results when itwas compared with the world best segmenter.You can get Achilles from the site?http://www.slc.atr.jp/?rzhang/Achilles.html?.ReferencesA.Ratnaparkhi.
