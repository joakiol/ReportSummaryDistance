Since ".&~i\[(" has notl,-ing to do with "~(/,'", race is excluded.
Wecall this inethod of looking up ECs in the inversedictionaries when choosing relevant equivalenciesinverse consultation, and we call the words ob-tained by looking up inverse dictionaries the se-lection area (SA).
Inverse consultation utilizes the.structure of dictionaries to measure the nearnessof the meanings of words in (tiff>rent languages.The simplest application of inverse consultationis to use Dic~_,~.
In the above example, each ECis looked up in Dict_,e and the results are com-pared with the English equivalencies of ")~'6"" (E);namely, competition, contest, and race.
The SA ofeompdt i t lon  is competit ion, contest and match,which have tile elements contest and competitionin common with E (Fig.
2).
As compdt i t ionderived from competition, competition should beput aside, but contest is still left as a commonelement and thus compdt i t ion  is selected as anequivalence of '"~(P"'.
As for race ,  the SA ofrace  consists  of race and ancestry, whose inter-section with E only gives race; so race is judgedas an inadequate EC.
In shorl;, the number of ele-ments in common between the selection area andE indicates the nearness of the meaning betweenthe EC and the original word.For the inverse consultation (lmseril)ed above,the SA was in English.
If we use Dice~j asan inverse dictionary successively afl;er consult>ing Dic~-.e, then the SA is in Japanese an(1 we~f\[' with the SA (Fig.

We (:all this process the selection p'ro-ced.ure.One way to do this is to count the mnnber ofspecific element:s in the SA.
For example, if theSA is in Japanesc', the number of l.he element ""~?~d@"' itself is counted.
Another way is to count howmany parts of words (PWs) are eontMnmd in theSA.  "
~a and  "?6" \[ or exaulple, the number o\[' ""'~:"contained in the SA is considered (thus "" ..... ~ in"~j~'~" iS ;dSO collnl;ed).If we handle the meaning of words, a third way.v)?.~ in ;t Japalmse Lhesaurns an(1 is to look up ' *'~-"COllar how nlal\]y times the synottynls ai)i)ear inthe $A.

If we go furtherto h;mdle the meaning, we might as well processwords by semantic processing.Since a kanji is an ideogram, the second methodalso handles the meaning.
When 1;11o s(,qectionarea is in English or l"rench, the eorresi)on(tingme.tlm(1 is to count morphemes such as "inl;er"and "national" for the word "int0.rnationar'.

In Dic/  ...... when there are no equiv-aleneies in m for a foreign word, the dictionarygives its definition or explam~tion of the word inm.
Therefore, all the foreign words can be con-tained in the dictionary.
In Dic,r>~f on tl,e otherhand, if there are no equivalencies in f for a wordof m, the word itself is often dropped fl'om thedictionary.
The words contained in the dictionaryare therefbre a part of m, and Dic ....... f lacks manyentries.

Of the latter, some examplesare listed in Table 5 and 6.
For d i s t ique  in Ta-ble 5, which is a term in French literature, De~jtranslates it into the term for the correspondingkind of Japanese literature.
Although it resem-bles to the direct translation of d is t ique,  it isonly an analogy.
On the other hand, since the di-rect translation of d i s t lque  in the published ic-t ionary adopts the concept of French imems, itis uncommon and cannot be mtt lerstoo(1  \])y iilOSl;Japanese readers.
The same is true for bou l ie rexcept that the commml Japanese is indicated ina published ictionary.
Pu l l  is borrowed front theEnglish word pull-over whose direct translation iscontained in a published dictionary, and it is nota common word in Japanese.In the first example in Table 6, gr ive is thegeneric name equivalent to th rush, whereas mer leis a kind of thrush.
The second example showsthat more equivalencies are found in Dj_d.To sum up, the resulting dictionary can be uti-lized in conjunction with the published (tictionar-ies as follows:?
To revise the equiwdeneies.?
To supplement the equivaleneies.Sections of the resulting dictionaries is listedin Table 7.
List 1 is Dj_~, and List 2 is D,+j .For each list, entrie.s arc in t;he first row and theirequiwdeneies are in the third row.
Symbols in the.second row indicate how approI/riate ach equiv-alence is.

)6 Re la ted  WorkThe use of a third hmguage English as an inter-mediary in the construction of a bilingual diet:to--nary was test;ed manually on a large scale on c(lit-ing the Spanish-Japanese (lictionary \[Kuwg0\].
It isnow a representative middle-sized ictionary hav-ing a large quantity of informal;ion.Toktmaga nd Tanaka \[Tok90\] tried t;o extract; aeonceI)tual dictionary fi'om Japanese-English andEnglish-Japanese dictionaries.
Although theyused a concept similar to ours that is the graphstructure of a dict ionaryrelate(\[  to meaning ofwords, their t?ameworks and final product differfrol i l  ol lrs.7 Conc lus ion  and  Future  WorksThe i)rol)osed method for using a intermediatehmguage to construct a l)ilingu:d dictionary uti-lizes the structure of dictionaries and morphemesand can choose appropriate equiwdencies for most,entries.
Comi)aring the resulting dictionary withpublishe(l dictionaries showed that tiara obtainedare usefltl for revising and sUi)l)lementing t.he vo-cabulary of existing dictionaires.To increase the accuracy with which eqniva-h',ncie.s can be selected, mistakes in word-to-worddictionaries must t)e corrected even if' our methodmay detect aI)i)ropri:~te equiwdeneies.
One wayto do this would be t.o use thesaurus to cheekwhether the extracted eorresi)ondences are rele-wmt.Nouns were l;akeu into consideration i tiffs re-search, and the next ste I) will be to apply theproposed method to other parts of speech.
