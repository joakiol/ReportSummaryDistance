THE LOCALITY PHENOMENON AND PARALLEL PROCESSING OFNATURAL LANGUAGEE.
L. Lozinskii and S. NirenburgDepartment of Computer ScienceThe Hebrew UniversityJerusalem, IsraelI .
Amon~ the various traditions established in computerprocessing of natural language during the twenty-odd yearsof research the understanding thet any such processing is tobe done sequentially has a special status.Even the most advanced natural language processingsystems employ the sequential mode as a necessary evil, ordo not even consider it an evil due to the ostensible lackof alternatives; thus, for instance, such well-known systemsas SAM, PAM, ELI /cf.
e.g.
Schank and Riesbeck, 1981/, PHRAN/cf.
e.g.
Arens, 1981/ or PARSIFAL /see e.g.
Marcus, 1979/are all based on sequentionslity.The recent advances in the VLSI technology suggest%her a re-evaluation of this tradition is in order.
Indeed,non-sequential "parallel ~ methods start emerging.
In thefield of AI one could mention, for example, Kornfeld's(1979, 1981) work in problem solving or the approach ofHEARSAY-II (see Erman et el., 1980) to speech processing.
Theword parallelism seems even to turn gradually into a current"buzz-word" in the AI community.
Note that the meaning ofthis word still remains largely loose.
Thus, Phillips andHendler (1981) snggest a system of several tss___~k-oriented- 186  -processors  working in  para l le l .2.
A d i f fe rent  and a more powerfu l  approach to para l le lp rocess ing  of  natura l  language i s  suggested here :  in 's teed offunct iona l  d i s t r ibut ion  we suggest  para l le l  d i s t r ibut ion  ofinput  stream e lements ;  a p rocessor  i s  ass igned to avery  i temof  input  and each such processor  i s  prov ided with the samesof tware  package, so that  a l l  p rocesses  w i th in  a cer ta ingroup become equal  in  s ta tus  and modus operand i .
(Note thatth i s  a l so  inc reases  the sys tem's  re l iab i l i ty ,  s ince  even inthe un l i ke ly  case of  fa i lu re  of  n-1 processes  the remain ingone w i l l  accompl ish the task  by i t se l f ,  in  the sequent ia lmod ?
o~Our approach to para l le l i sm i s  based on the phenomenonof  loca l i ty .
Cur rent ly  we apply i t  to const ruc t ing  a syntact -i c  parsing system for s subset of English, as e simple caseof natural language processing.3.
Let us cons ider  a text  as a vector  made up of  d i sc re -te  elements wi:T = /w0,  wl ,  .
.
.
,  Wn/ .Being fed  with T a cer ta in  Natura l  Laugue~e Processor  (NLP)produces a structure of the form S(T) = /v0, Vl, ..., Vm/,where vj can be of various nature: words in the object lang-uage and/or word~ and symbols in a metalangua~e and/or vari-ous kinds of delimiters.Let D(Vj) be the minimal subset of T determining v~ inthe sense that information carried in the elements of th~ssubset is necessary end sufficient for outputting vj by theNLP.
Let gj be the index of the leftmost element of D(v.) inthe string T, and Hi, the index of the rightmost one (e.?g.if D(v~) = /w3, ws, w10/ then g~ = 3 and hj = 10).
We now de-fine the important notion of locality.
Locality of an outputelement v;j i s  l ( vS) :  , - h .
i -g~ = ~ ;hj hj- 187  -This funct ion  has a number of in teres t ing  proper t ies .
I f  anoutput  element v~ depends on exact ly  one element wi, then i t slocality is unity, the highest possible value.
On the otherhand, if a certain v k depends on ?
large range of input elem-ents, then i t s  loca l i ty  i s  c lose to zero.
Comparir~ para l le land sequent ia l  prooessinE we show that  the ra t io  of the t imenecessary  to produce an output  element in  para l le l  mode tothat  of the sequent ia l  mode s t r i c t ly  depends on the loca l i tyof th i s  e lement.
Moreover, the re la t ive  time ga in  of para l le lp rocess in8  as regards sequent ia l  process ing i s  exact ly  theg iven  e lement ' s  loca l i ty .
In other  words, the greater  the~egate  loca l i ty  of e lements in  a cer ta in  text ,  the morebenefit there is in its parallel processing.
Such is the in-trinsic connection between the notion of locality and the per-formance of a system based on para l le l  p rocess ing .4.
The process of implementat ion s tar ts  with f ind ingc lus ters  of h~h loca l i ty  in  the text .A t  th i s  s t~e we provethe fo l low ing.Proposition.
NPs, .VPs and PPs of English are highly local.On this basis we proceed to build a system of parallel pars-i r~  fo r  ~ l iah .
In  i t s  p resent  form the system cons is ts  ofthree  modules: a morphologica l  and two syntact i c  ones.
Theresu l t  of the f i r s t  stage i s  a set  of se ts  of d i s t ionary  en-t r ies  fo r  every input  word, which determines the syntact i cc lasses  to which the input  words may in  pr inc ip le  be long.
A~.ammar fo r  each processor  et  the f i r s t  syntact i c  stage ofana lys i s  i s  presented as a tab le  which ind icates  a l l  the cor -rec t  t r iads  of syntact i c  c lass  members in  the subset  of E r~ l -i sh  We are ana lyz ing .
This means that  th i s  stnge i s  devotedto f ind ing  the s ta tes  of compat ib i l i ty  between the "neigh-bouts"  in  the input  s t r ing .
I t  te rminates  when a l l  the poss ib -le  t r iads  have been checked, produces cand idates  fo r  cor rec tparses ( i f  any) and t rans fers  them to the second syntact i cstage whose task i s  a /  to car ry  out a l l  k inds  of agreement- 188  -and completeness  tes ts  (e .g .

and b /  to  bu i ld  one or  more representat ions  ofthe parse(s )  (e .g .
a const i tuent  t ree  and a pred icate - ro les t ruc ture) .
