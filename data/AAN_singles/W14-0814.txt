(fields of multi-word expressions), an ex-perimental lexicographic resource that fo-cusses on aspects of MWEs that are rarelyaddressed in traditional descriptions: Con-texts, patterns and interrelations.
TheMWE fields use data from a very largecorpus of written German (over 6 billionword forms) and are created in a strictlycorpus-based way.
In addition to tradi-tional lexicographic descriptions, they in-clude quantitative corpus data which isstructured in new ways in order to showthe usage specifics.
This way of lookingat MWEs gives insight in the structure oflanguage and is especially interesting forforeign language learners.1 Our concept of MWEsWe study MWEs from a linguistic perspectiveand are mainly interested in two questions: Whatcan we learn about the nature of MWEs and theirstatus in language by studying large corpora?
Andhow can we present MWEs in novel lexicographicways that reflect our findings?
The MWE fieldpresented in this contribution is a prototypethat reflects our current ideas regarding thesequestions.
It can be explored online free of chargeat http://wvonline.ids-mannheim.de/wvfelder-v3/index.html.Our approach is based on the concept ?UsuelleWortverbindungen?
(UWV, Steyer 2000; Steyer2004; Steyer 2013), which defines MWEs as con-ventionalized patterns of language use that man-ifest themselves in recurrent syntagmatic struc-tures.
This includes not only idioms and idiosyn-cratic structures, but all multi-word units whichhave acquired a distinct function in communica-tion.
Our focus is on real-life usage, pragmat-ics and context.
We work bottom-up in detectingand describing MWE units in a strongly corpus-driven way (Sinclair 1991; Tognini-Bonelli 2001;Hanks 2013), taking iterative steps to arrive atconclusions about language use.
Methologi-cally, our approach bears some similarities toStefanowitsch/Gries?
?collostructions?
(Stefanow-itsch/Gries 2003) though we are less interested insyntactic and grammatical structures - as it is com-mon in construction grammar approaches - but seeMWEs primarily as parts of the lexicon and feelcloser to phraseology.The basis of our research is DeReKo (DeutschesReferenzkorpus, Institut f?r Deutsche Sprache2012), the largest collection of written Germanavailable today which has over six billion word to-kens and is located at the Institute for the GermanLanguage (IDS).
In the current stage of our work,which is mainly explorative, we use DeReKo asit is.
This means our text basis is dominated bynewspaper texts from the last 10-15 years.
Thoughthis is surely not a ?balanced?
corpus, we argue thatit still reflects much of contemporary written lan-guage use, as newspaper texts are a medium thatis widely disseminated.Though the interpretation and main analysis isdone manually, automatic methods form an im-portant basis to our work.
We use a sophisti-cated method of collocation analysis developed atthe IDS (Belica 1995) to get indications whichword combinations constitute MWEs and to ex-plore contexts in which an MWE is commonlyused.
In addition to that, we use a pattern matchingtool developed in our project to explore and struc-ture corpus evidence and gain further insight intothe behavior and variations of MWE candidates.Our special interest lies in the fact that MWEsare not as fixed as is often assumed, but often be-have as patterns and show multiple interrelations.Therefore, we also describe MWE patterns - a82Figure 1: Part of the MWE field centered around Grund and preposition aus.more abstract form of MWEs which are only par-tially fixed.
An example for a fixed MWE is Pimal Daumen (pi times thumb - ?approximately?
),a multi-word expression that is always used in ex-actly this form.
MWE patterns on the other handconsist of fixed lexical components as well as slotsthat can be filled in different ways.
In spite of thisvariability, the whole pattern has a holistic mean-ing and function.
An example is the expressionwie NOUN in jemandes Ohren klingen (to soundlike NOUN in someone?s ears - ?to be perceived ina certain way?
(specified by NOUN)).
The NOUNslot can be filled with different words in order tospecify the general meaning of the pattern.
In sec-tion 2.3 we will go into further detail about how aslot in an MWE pattern can be filled.The MWE field presented in this contri-bution centers around the word Grund (rea-son/basis/foundation) combined with severalprepositions.
It is the newest of several versionsof MWE fields which have been describedelsewhere (cf.
Brunner/Steyer 2009; Brunner/Steyer 2010) and are available at our websitehttp://wvonline.ids-mannheim.deas well.
This newest version focusses more onhierarchies of MWEs and MWE patterns andincorporates additional resources like collocationanalyses in its descriptive texts.
In the following,we will highlight some features of the MWEfield which illustrate our focus on interrelations,contexts and patterns.2 MWE field Grund2.1 InterrelationsFigure 1 shows a part of the MWE field, centeredon the word Grund and preposition aus.
Eachnode is linked to a lexicographic description.
Fig-ure 2 presents a screenshot of one of those articles.In addition to narrative descriptions and manu-ally selected usage examples from our corpus, thearticles also include components that are derivedfrom quantitative corpus data.
Specifically, theseare collocation analyses as well as filler tables forMWE patterns.
The function of these componentswill be explained in more detail in sections 2.2 and2.3.In Figure 1, you can observe the relations be-tween MWEs (thick border) and MWE patterns(regular border).
The nodes with the dashed bor-der represent repeating surface structures whichthemselves have no common holistic meaning butshow the lexical interconnectedness between theMWEs and MWE patterns.All nodes enclosed in the square field containthe elements Grund and auf.
The nodes on thefar right are extensions which do not belong tothe core of the MWE field as it was defined, butare connected lexically and functionally to MWEsthat do.
We decided to include those ?externalnodes?
to give a glimpse of how the buildingblocks of language connect even beyond the arti-ficial borders that where necessary when definingthe MWE field.83Figure 2: MWE article Aus welchen Gr?nden auch immer from the MWE field Grund.
The article partsare ?Frequency in the Corpus?, ?General description?, ?Context Analysis?, ?Contrast Analysis?
and ?Su-perordinated Nodes?.
The part ?Context Analysis?
contains links to a filler table and to the correspondingKWIC lines.In this example the core field contains theMWEs aus welchem Grund auch immer and auswelchen Gr?nden auch immer (?for whatever rea-son/s?).
However, the lexical components auchimmer are part of more general patterns as well.The word form Grund can be substituted by differ-ent nouns in the MWE pattern aus welch- SUB-Gauch immer (e.g.
Motiv (motive), Richtung (di-rection)).
In the MWE pattern PRON auch im-mer the place is taken by an interrogative pronoun(e.g.
was (what), wo (where), wer (who), warum(why)).
One of those pronoun fillers, wie (how),is much more frequent than the others, which jus-tifies the definition of a separate MWE wie auchimmer, which can be translated as ?howsoever?
or?to whatever extent?
(see section 2.3 for more de-tails).The basic structure of the MWE field thushighlights the different degrees of abstraction ofMWEs and the functional use of lexical clusterslike auch immer.
The lexicographic descriptionslinked to the nodes explain the interrelations andthe differences in usage and meaning.2.2 ContextsAnother important aspect of our approach toMWEs is that we pay close attention to the con-texts in which they are commonly used.
A goodtool to explore this empirically is collocation anal-ysis.
In addition to narrative descriptions and man-ually selected corpus examples we therefore in-clude the results of collocation analysis in our ar-ticles.One interesting aspect is the difference between84Figure 3: Highest ranking results of the collocation analysis for eigentlich (scope: 5 words in front).MWEs and their single-lexeme quasi-synonyms.For example the meaning of the MWE im Grundeis very close to the lexeme eigentlich (actually).Figures 3 and 4 show the highest ranking resultsof a collocation analysis that focusses on a windowof five words in front of the units eigentlich and imGrunde respectively and calculates the log likeli-hood ratio.1When comparing the results for thesetwo units you can see that there are some con-texts that are strongly preferred by eigentlich butare not highly ranked for im Grunde.
Notable arethe combination schade eigentlich (sad actually)as well as combinations with interrogative adverbslike wie (how), was (what), warum (why).
TheMWE im Grunde, on the other hand, has strongcollocation partners that are capitalized conjunc-tions like aber (but) or denn (because).
This in-dicates a clear tendency to appear near the begin-ning of a sentence in contexts where an argumentis made, which is not prominent for eigentlich.
Soeven if a quasi-synonymous single lexeme exists,the MWE shows differences in usage which be-come apparent when studying large quantities ofdata.1For details on the collocation analysis used here seePerkuhn/Belica 2004.

When exploring MWEs, we use apattern matching tool that allows us to search largequantities of keyword in context lines (KWICs) forcombinations of fixed strings and slots.
The lexi-cal fillers of these slots can also be counted andpresented in the form of frequency tables.
This al-lows us to explore which kinds of variations arepossible and typical for an MWE.
The filler tablescan show quite different ?profiles?
for a slot.
In thefollowing, we will give some examples.For the MWE aus welchen Gr?nden auch im-mer (for whatever reasons) we checked whetherthe element Gr?nden can be modified by searchingfor the pattern aus welchen #*Gr?ndenauch immer (#*stands for a slot that can befilled by any number of words).
Table 1 shows theabsolute and relative frequencies that where calcu-lated from KWIC lines of our corpus.
In the vastmajority of cases, the slot is empty, which meansthat the MWE is used exactly in the form citedabove: aus welchen Gr?nden auch immer.
It isthus very stable, though not completely inflexible,as there is also evidence of adjectives that are usedto further specify the reasons in question, e.g.
per-s?nlichen Gr?nden (personal reasons).A different example of filler behavior can beobserved when studying the pattern # auchimmer (# marks a slot that has to be filled withexactly one word).
Table 2 shows that this slot85Figure 4: Highest ranking results of the collocation analysis for im Grunde (scope: 5 words in front).Filler Freq Rel Freq1239 98.33unerfindlichen 3 0.24pers?nlichen 2 0.16legitimen 1 0.08durchsichtigen 1 0.08politischen 1 0.08r?tselhaften 1 0.08psychologisch-pers?nlichen 1 0.08mir nicht verst?ndlichen 1 0.08besagten 1 0.08(PR-) 1 0.08psychologischen 1 0.08(un)berechtigten 1 0.08" 1 0.08(oft ?konomischen) 1 0.08. .

.Table 1: Fillers of the pattern aus welchen #*Gr?nden auch immer.is filled by wie (capitalized or non-capitalized) innearly 18 percent of the matches.
In this case, asingle lexical filler is very dominant.
This was astrong indication for us that the pattern wie auchimmer functions as an MWE while at the sametime being a prototypical realization of the pat-tern PRON auch immer.
Also quite frequent is thefiller Gr?nden, which indicates the pattern [auswelchen] Gr?nden auch immer, and other inter-rogative pronouns and adverbs like was (what),Filler Freq Rel FreqWie 9611 10.08wie 7389 7.75was 5289 5.55aber 3397 3.56Gr?nden 3157 3.31es 2288 2.40Was 1953 2.05Wer 1825 1.91sich 1677 1.76warum 1529 1.60wo 1486 1.56wer 1446 1.52ja 1333 1.40wem 1292 1.35ist 1276 1.34. .

.Table 2: Fillers of the pattern # auch immer.wer (who), wem (whom) etc.
This lead us to de-fine the MWE hierarchies as shown in figure 1 andexplained in section 2.1.A different filler profile (Table 3) can be ob-served for the pattern aus # Gr?nden (for #reasons).
This is a true MWE pattern, as it hasa specific communicative function tied to the plu-ral form of Grund: reasons are mentioned, but leftintentionally vague.
Table 3 shows that there is alarge number of adjectives that can fill the gap.

.Table 3: Fillers of the pattern aus # Gr?nden.none of these is so dominant and striking that aseparate MWE needs to be considered.
However,the fillers can be grouped into functional groups,like type of the reasons (e.g.
politisch (political),pers?nlich (personal), finanziell (financial)), va-lidity of the reasons (e.g.
nachvollziehbar (under-standable), gut (good), triftig (valid)) or relevanceof the reasons (e.g.
wichtig (important), zwingend(imperative)).You can see that filler tables are very useful fordifferent purposes: To confirm the fixedness of anMWE and explore occasional variations, to con-ceptualize lexical units in order to build up hierar-chies, and to further describe and understand thebehavior of MWE patterns.
Not only do we workwith such patterns and filler tables when buildingthe MWE field, we also include them in our de-scriptions - another way to give a user access tooriginal corpus data structured in an informativeway.Additionally, we provide access to the KWIClines that were used to calculate the filler tables.Table 4 shows some of the lines that match thepattern aus # Gr?nden.
These lines are struc-tured in fields according to the search pattern andthe different columns can be sorted.
In this way,you can explore the use of specific MWE struc-tures yourself.3 ConclusionWe believe that our MWE fields allow a differentway to look at MWEs which is very useful to un-derstand the structure of language.
As they arestrictly based on data from a large modern lan-guage corpus, our findings also reflect real, con-temporary language use.
This is especially usefulfor foreign language learners who struggle to nav-igate the complexities of fixedness and variabilityin the German language.
In continuing our MWEresearch, we strive to refine our strategies for de-scription and visualization and also plan to addcontrastive studies in the future.ReferencesBelica, Cyril: Statistische Kollokationsanal-yse und Clustering.
