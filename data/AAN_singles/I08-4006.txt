Chinese Word Sense Disambiguation with PageRank and HowNetJinghua WangBeijing University of Postsand  TelecommunicationsBeijing, Chinawjh_smile@163.comJianyi LiuBeijing University of Postsand TelecommunicationsBeijing, Chinajianyilui@sohu.comPing ZhangShenyang NormalUniversityShenyang, Chinapinney58@163.comAbstractWord sense disambiguation is a basicproblem in natural language processing.This paper proposed an unsupervised wordsense disambiguation method basedPageRank and HowNet.
In the method, afree text is firstly represented as a sememegraph with sememes as vertices andrelatedness of sememes as weighted edgesbased on HowNet.
Then UW-PageRank isapplied on the sememe graph to score theimportance of sememes.
Score of eachdefinition of one word can be computedfrom the score of sememes it contains.Finally, the highest scored definition isassigned to the word.
This approach istested on SENSEVAL-3 and theexperimental results prove practical andeffective.1 IntroductionWord sense disambiguation, whose purpose is toidentify the correct sense of a word in context, isone of the most important problems in naturallanguage processing.
There are two differentapproaches: knowledge-based and corpus-based(Montoyo, 2005).
Knowledge-based methoddisambiguates words by matching context withinformation from a prescribed knowledge source,such as WordNet and HowNet.
Corpus-basedmethods are also divided into two kinds:unsupervised and supervised (Lu Z, 2007).Unsupervised methods cluster words into somesets which indicate the same meaning, but they cannot give an exact explanation.
Supervisedmachine-learning method learns from annotatedsense examples.
Though corpus-based approachusually has better performance, the mount of wordsit can disambiguate essentially relies on the size oftraining corpus, while knowledge-based approachhas the advantage of providing larger coverage.Knowledge-based methods for word sensedisambiguation are usually applicable to all wordsin the text, while corpus-based techniques usuallytarget only few selected word for which largecorpora are made available (Mihalcea, 2004).This paper presents an unsupervised word sensedisambiguation algorithm based on HowNet.Words?
definition in HowNet is composed of somesememes which are the smallest, unambiguoussense unit.
First, a free text is represented as asememe graph, in which sememes are defined asvertices and relatedness of sememes are defined asweighted edges.
Then UW-PageRank is applied onthis graph to score the importance of sememes.Score of each definition of one word can bededuced from the score of sememes it contains.Finally, the highest scored definition is assigned tothe word.
This algorithm needs no corpus, and isable to disambiguate all the words in the text at onetime.
The experiment result shows that ouralgorithm is effective and practical.2 HowNetHowNet (Dong, Z.
D, 2000) is not only a machinereadable dictionary, but also a knowledge basewhich organizes words or concepts as theyrepresent in the object world.
It has been widelyused in word sense disambiguation and pruning,text categorization, text clustering, text retrieval,machine translation, etc (Dong, Z.
D, 2007).39Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing2.1 The content and structure of HowNetHowNet is an online common-sense knowledgebased unveiling inter-conceptual relations andinter-attribute relations of concepts as connoting inlexicons of the Chinese and English equivalents.There are over 16000 word records in thedictionary.

is the part of speech of this concept inChinese, and ?G_E?
is that in English; ?E_C?
isthe example of the concept; ?W_E?
is the conceptin English; ?DEF?
is the definition.Definitions of words are composed of a series ofsememes (usually more than one ?
like DEFNo.017630 contains ?buy|?
?
and ?commercial|?
?)
?
like ?beat|?
?
which is the smallestunambiguous unit of concept.
First sememe of thedefinition like ?buy|??
of DEF No.017630 is themain attribution of the definition.
Sememes havebeen classified into 8 categories, such as attribute,entity, event role and feature, event, quantity value,quantity, secondary feature and syntax.
Sememesin one category form a tree structure withhypernymy / hyponymy relation.
Sememesconstruct concepts, e.g.
definition, so the wordsense disambiguation task of assigning definitionto word can be done through the computation ofsememes.2.2 The similarity of sememesThe tree structure of sememes makes it possible tojudge the relatedness of them with a precisionmathematical method.
Rada (Rada, R, 1989)defined the conceptual distance between any twoconcepts as the shortest path through a semanticnetwork.
The shortest path is the one whichincludes the fewest number of intermediateconcepts.
With Rada?s algorithm, the more similartwo concepts are, the smaller their shortest path is,and so we use the reciprocal of the length ofshortest path as the similarity.
Leacock andChodorow (Leacock, C, 1998) define it as follows:1 2 1 2( , ) max[ log( ( , ) /(2 ))lchsim c c length c c D= ?where length(c1, c2) is the shortest path lengthbetween the two concepts and D is the maximumdepth of the taxonomy.Wu and Palmer (Wu, Z., 1994) define anotherformula to measure the similarity)()()),((2),(212121 cdepthcdepthcclcsdepthccsimwup +?=depth is the distance from the concept node to theroot of the hierarchy.
lcs(c1,c2) is the most specificconcept that two concepts have in common, that isthe lowest common subsumer.3 PageRank on Sememe GraphPageRank is an algorithm of deciding theimportance of vertices in a graph.
Sememes fromHowNet can be viewed as an undirected weightedgraph, which defines sememes as vertices,relations of sememes as edges and the relatednessof connected sememes as the weights of edges.Because PageRank formula is defined for directedgraph, a modified PageRank formula is applied touse on the undirected weighted graph fromHowNet.3.1 PageRankPageRank (Page, L., 1998) which is widely usedby search engines for ranking web pages based onthe importance of the pages on the web is analgorithm essentially for deciding the importanceof vertices within a graph.
The main idea is that: ina directed graph, when one vertex links to anotherone, it is casting a vote for that other vertex.
Themore votes one vertex gets, the more important thisvertex is.
PageRank also takes account the voter:the more important the voter is, the more importantthe vote itself is.
In one word, the score associatedwith a vertex is determined based on the votes thatare cast for it, and the score of the vertex castingthese votes.
So this is the definition:Let G=(V,E) be a directed graph with the set ofvertices V and set of edges E, when E is a subset ofV?V.
For a given vertex Vi, let In(Vi) be the set ofvertices that point to it, and let Out(Vi) be the set ofedges going out of vertex Vi.
The PageRank scoreof vertex Vi is40Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing?
?+?=)( )()(*)1()(iVInj jjiVOutVSddVSd is a damping factor that can be set between 0 and1,and usually set at 0.85 which is the value we usein this paper (Mihalcea, R., 2004).PageRank starts from arbitrary values assignedto each vertex in the graph, and ends when theconvergence below a given threshold is achieved.Experiments proved that it usually stops computingwithin 30 iterations (Mihalcea, R., 2004).PageRank can be also applied on undirectedgraph, in which case the out-degree of a vertex isequal to the in-degree of the vertex.3.2 PageRank on sememe graphSememes from HowNet can be organized in agraph, in which sememes are defined as vertices,and similarity of connected sememes are definedas weight of edges.
The graph can be constructedas an undirected weighted graph.We applied PageRank on the graph with amodified formula??
?+?=)( )()()(*)1()(iVCj jjijiVDVSEweightddVSC(Vi)is the set of edges connecting with Vj,weight(Eij)is the weight of edge Eij connectingvertex Vi and Vj, and D(Vj) is the degree of Vj.This formula is named UW-PageRank.
In sememegraph, we define sememes as vertices, relations ofsememes as edges and the relatedness of connectedsememes as the weights of edges.
UW-PageRankis applied on this graph to measure the importanceof the sememes.
The higher score one sememegets, the more important it is.4 Word sense disambiguation based onPageRankTo disambiguate words in the text, firstly the textis converted to an undirected weighted sememegraph based on HowNet.
The sememes which arefrom all the definitions for all the words in the textform the vertices of the graph and they areconnected by edges whose weight is the similarityof the two sememes.
Then, we use UW-PageRankto measure the importance of the vertex in thegraph, so all the sememes are scored.
So eachdefinition of one word can be scored based on thescore of the sememes it contains.
Finally, thehighest scored definition is assigned to the word asits meaning.4.1 Text representation as a graphTo use PageRank algorithm to do disambiguation,a graph which represents the text and interconnectsthe words with meaningful relations should bebuilt first.
All the words in the text should be POStagged first, and then find all the definitionspertaining to the word in HowNet with its POS.Different sememes from these definitions form thevertices of the graph.
Edges are added between thevertices whose weights are the similarity of thesememes.
The similarity can be measured by thealgorithm in Section 2.2.
As mentioned in Section2.1, all the sememes in HowNet are divided intoeight categories, and in each category, sememesare connected in a tree structure.
So based on thealgorithms in Section 2.2, each two sememes inone category, i.e.
in one tree, have a similaritymore than 0, but if they are in different category,they will have a similarity equal to 0.
As a result, atext will be represented in a sememe graph that iscomposed of several small separate fully connectedgraphs.Assumed that a text containing ?word1 word2word3?
is to be represented in a graph.
Thedefinition (DEF) and sememes for each word arelisted in Table 1.Table 1. ?

For example, S1 and S2 are connectedwith an edge weighted 0.3.The relation of word,DEF and sememes is represented in Figure1, andsememe graph is in Figure 2.41Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language ProcessingFigure 1.

Sememe Graph4.2 Word sense disambiguation based onPageRankText has been represented in a sememe graph withsememes as vertices and similarity of sememes asthe weight of the edges.
Then, UW-PageRank isused to measure the importance of the vertex, i.e.sememes in the graph.
The score of all the verticesin Figure 1 is in Table 2.Table 2.

So we use anothermethod to assign one DEF to one word taking firstsememe into consideration.
For all the DEF of oneword, if one first sememe of one DEF gets thehighest score, the DEF is assigned to the word.

We use precision as themeasure of performance and random tagging as thebaseline.
We crossly use Rada?s (R), Leacock &Chodorowp?s (L), and Wu and Palmer?s (W)methods to measure the similarity of sememes withmean method (M) and first sememe (FS) scoringthe DEF.
The precision of the combinationalgorithm is listed in Table 4.Li (Li W., 2005) used naive bayes classifier withfeatures extracted from People?s Daily News to doword sense disambiguation on SENSEVAL-3.
Theprecision is listed in line ?Li?
of table as acomparison.The average precision of our algorithm is aroundtwo times higher than the baseline, and 5 of the 6combination algorithm gets better performancethan Li.
And for 5/6 word case, our algorithm getsthe best performance.
Among the three methods ofmeasure the similarity of sememes, Rada?s methodgets the best performance.
And between the twomethods of scoring definition, ?Mean method?works better, which indicates that although the firstsememe is the most important meaning of onedefinition, the other sememes are also veryimportant, and the importance of other sememesalso should be taken into consideration whilescoring the definition.
Of all the combination ofalgorithms, ?Rada + Mean?
gets the bestperformance, which takes a reasonable way tomeasure the similarity of two sememes andcomprehensively scores the definition based on theimportance of its sememes in the sememe graphfrom the whole text.6 Related worksMany works in Chinese word sensedisambiguation with HowNet.
Chen Hao (ChenHao, 2005) brought up a k-means cluster methodbase on HowNet, which firstly convert contextsthat include ambiguous words into context vectors;then, the definitions of ambiguous words inHownet can be determined by calculating thesimilarity between these context vectors.
To dodisambiguation, Yan Rong (Yan Rong, 2006) firstextracted some most relative words from the textbased on the co-occurrence, then calculate thesimilarity between each definition of ambiguousword and its relative words, and finally find themost similar definition as its meaning.
Thesimilarity of definitions is measured by theweighted mean of the similarity of sememes, andthe similarity of sememes is measured by amodified Rada?s formula.
Gong YongEn (GongYongEn, 2006) used a similar method with Yan,and more over, he took recurrence of sememes intoconsideration.
Compare with those methods, ourmethod has a more precious sememes?
similaritymeasure method, and make full use of the structureof its tree structure by representing text in graphand use UW-PageRank to judge sememes?importance in the whole text, that is the mostobvious difference from them.
Mihalceal(Mihalceal, 2004) first provide the semantic graphmethod to do word sense disambiguation, but herwork is totally on English with WordNet, which isdefinitely different in meaning representation fromHowNet.
WordNet uses synsets to group similarconcepts together and differentiate them, whileHowNet use a close set of sememes to constructconcept definitions.
In Mihalceal?s method, the43Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processingvertexes of graph are synsets, and in ours aresememes.
And after measure the importance ofsememes, an additional strategy is used to judgethe score of definition based on the sememes.7 ConclusionAn unsupervised method is applied to word sensedisambiguation based on HowNet.
First, a free textis represented as a sememe graph with sememes asvertices and relatedness of sememes as weightededges.
Then UW-PageRank is applied on thisgraph to score the importance of sememes.
Scoreof each definition of one word can be deducedfrom the score of sememes it contains.
Finally, thehighest scored definition is assigned to the word.Our algorithm is tested on SENSEVAL-3 and theexperimental results prove our algorithm to bepractical and effective.AcknowledgmentThis study is supported by BeijingNatural Science Foundation of (4073037) andMinistry of Education DoctorFoundation (20060013007).ReferencesChen hao, He Tingting, Ji Donghong, Quan Changqing,2005.
