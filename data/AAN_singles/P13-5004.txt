These information sourcescan all be exploited together in order to automat-ically acquire vast amounts of up-to-date, wide-coverage structured knowledge.
This knowledge,in turn, can be used to measure the pulse of a va-riety of social phenomena like political events, ac-tivism and stock prices, as well as to detect emerg-ing events such as natural disasters (earthquakes,tsunami, etc.
).The main purpose of this tutorial is to introducesocial media as a resource to the Natural LanguageProcessing (NLP) community both from a scien-tific and an application-oriented perspective.
Tothis end, we focus on micro-blogs such as Twitter,and show how it can be successfully mined to per-form complex NLP tasks such as the identificationof events, topics and trends.
Furthermore, this in-formation can be used to build high-end sociallyintelligent applications that tap the wisdom of thecrowd on a large scale, thus successfully bridgingthe gap between computational text analysis andreal-world, mission-critical applications such as fi-nancial forecasting and natural crisis management.Tutorial Outline1.
Social media and the wisdom of the crowd.We review the resources which will be the focusof the tutorial, i.e.
Twitter and micro-blogging ingeneral, and present their most prominent and dis-tinguishing aspects (Kwak et al 2010; Gouws etal., 2011), namely: (i) instant short-text messag-ing, including its specific linguistic characteris-tics (e.g., non-standard spelling, shortenings, lo-gograms, etc.)
and other features ?
i.e., mentions(@), hashtags (#), shortened URLs, etc.
; (ii) a dy-namic network structure where users are highlyinter-connected and author profile information isprovided along with other metadata.
We intro-duce these properties by highlighting the differ-ent trade-offs related to resources of this kind,as well as their comparison with alternative datapublishing platforms ?
for instance, highly un-structured text vs. rich network structure, semi-structured metadata tagging (like hashtags) vs.fully-structured linked open data, etc.2.
Analyzing and extracting structured infor-mation from social media.
We provide an in-depth overview of contributions aimed at tappingthe wealth of information found within Twitterand other micro-blogs.
We first show how so-cial media can be used for many different NLPtasks, ranging from pre-processing tasks like PoStagging (Gimpel et al 2011) and Named EntityRecognition (Ritter et al 2011) through high-enddiscourse (Ritter et al 2010) and information ex-traction applications like event detection (Popescuet al 2011; Ritter et al 2012) and topic track-ing (Lin et al 2011).
We then focus on noveltasks and challenges opened up by social mediasuch as geoparsing, which aims to predict the lo-cation (including its geographic coordinates) of amessage or user based on his posts (Gelernter andMushegian, 2011; Han et al 2012), and methodsto automatically establish the credibility of user-generated content by making use of contextual andmetadata features (Castillo et al 2011).3.
Exploiting social media for real-world appli-cations: trend detection, social sensing and cri-sis management.
We present methods to detectemerging events and breaking news from socialmedia (Mathioudakis et al 2010; Petrovic?
et al2010, inter alia).
Thanks to their highly dynamicenvironment and continuously updated content, infact, micro-blogs and social networks are capableof providing real-time information for a wide vari-5ety of different social phenomena, including con-sumer confidence and presidential job approvalpolls (O?Connor et al 2010), as well as stock mar-ket prices (Bollen et al 2011; Ruiz et al 2012).We focus in particular on applications that use so-cial media for health surveillance in order to mon-itor, for instance, flu epidemics (Aramaki et al2011), as well as crisis management systems thatleverage them for tracking natural disasters likeearthquakes (Sakaki et al 2010; Neubig et al2011) and tsunami (Zielinski and Bu?rgel, 2012;Zielinski et al 2013).ReferencesEiji Aramaki, Sachiko Maskawa, and Mizuki Morita.2011.
