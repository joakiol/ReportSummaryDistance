ukAbst rac tThis paper establishes a framework un-der which various aspects of prosodicmorphology, such as templatic morphol-ogy and infixation, can be handled undertwo-level theory using an implementedmulti-tape two-level model.
The paperprovides a new computational nalysis ofroot-and-pattern morphology based onprosody.1 In t roduct ionProsodic Morphology (McCarthy and Prince,1986, et seq.)
provides adequate means for de-scribing non-linear phenomena such as infixation,reduplication and templatic morphology.
Stan-dard two-level systems proved to be cumbersomein describing such operations - see (Sproat, 1992,p.

Multi-tape two-levelmorphology (Kay, 1987; Kiraz, 1994, et.
seq.)
ad-dresses various issues in the domain of non-linearmorphology: It has been used in analysing root-and-pattern morphology (Kiraz, 1994), the Arabicbroken plural phenomenon (Kiraz, 1996a), and er-ror detection in non-concatenative strings (Bow-den and Kiraz, 1995).
The purpose of this pa-per is to demonstrate how non-linear operationswhich are motivated by prosody can also be de-scribed within this framework, drawing examplesfrom Arabic.The analysis of Arabic presented here differsfrom earlier computa\[ional accounts in that it em-ploys new linguistic descriptions of Arabic mor-phology, viz.
moraic and affixational theories (Mc-Carthy and Prince, 1990b; McCarthy, 1993).The former argues that a different vocabulary isSupported by a Benefactor Studentship from StJohn's College.
This research was done under the su-pervision of Dr Stephen G. Pulman.needed to represent the pattern morpheme accord-ing to the Prosodic Morphology Hypothesis (see?1:1), contrary to the earlier CV model where tem-plates are represented as sequences of Cs (conso-nants) and Vs (vowels).
The latter departed rad-ically from the notion of root-and-pattern mor-phology in the description of the Arabic verbalstem (see ?3).The choice of the linguistic model depends onthe application in question and is left for the gram-marian.
Tile purpose here is to demonstrate hatmulti-tape two-level morphology is adequate forrepresenting these various linguistic models.The following convention has been adopted.Morphemes are represented in braces, { }, andsurface forms in solidi, / /.
In listings of gram-mars and lexica, variables begin with a capitalletter.The structure of the papcr is as follows: Sec-tion 2 demonstrates how Arabic templatic mor-phology can be analysed by prosodic terms, andsection 3 looks into infixation; finally, section 4provides some concluding remarks.
The rest ofthis section introduces prosodic morphology andestablishes the computational framework behindthis presentation.1.1 Prosodic MorphologyThere are three essential principles in prosodicmorphology (McCarthy and Prince, 1990a; Mc-Carthy and Prince, 1993).
They are:(i) a. PROSODIC  MORPHOLOGY HYPOTHE-SIS.
Templates are defined in terms ofthe authentic units of prosody: mora(it), syllable (~), foot (Ft), prosodicword  (PrWd) .b.
TEMPLATE SAT ISFACT ION CONDI -TION.
Satisfaction of templates con-straints is obligatory and is determinedby the principles of prosody, both uni-versal and language-specific.664c.
PROSODIC CIRCUMSCRIPTION.
Thedomain to which morphological oper-ations apply may be circumscribed byprosodic riteria as well as by the morefamiliar morphological ones.In the Prosod ic  Morpho logy  Hypothes is ,morn is the unit of syllabic weight; a monomoraicsyllable, oh,  is light (L), and a bimoraic syllable,a~,~, is heavy (H).
The most common types of syl-lables are: open light, CV, open heavy, CVV, andclosed heavy, CVC.
This typology is representedgraphically in (2).G (7 (7CV CVV CVCAssociation of Cs and Vs to templates i based onthe Template  Sat is fact ion Condi t ion.
Asso-ciation takes the following form: a node a alwaystakes a C, and a morn # takes a V; however, in bi-morale syllables, the second # may be associatedto either a C or a V}Prosod ic  C i rcumscr ip t ion  (PC) defines thedomain of morphological operations.
Normally,the domain of a typical morphological operationis a grammatical category (root, stem or word),resulting in prefixation or sufilxation.
Under PC,however, the domain of a morphological opera-tion is a prosodically-delimited substring withina grammatical category, often resulting in somesort of infixation.
The essential for PC is a pars-ing function ~I~ of the form in (3).
(3) PARSING FUNCTION+(c, E)Let B be a base (i.e.
stem or word).
The  func-tion ~I~ returns the constituent C that sits on theedge E E {right, left) of the base B.
The  resultis a factoring of B into: kernel, designated byB:~, which is the string returned by the parsingfunction, and residue, designated by B/O,  whichis the remainder of B.
The  relation between B:~and B /~ is given in (4), where ~ is the concate-nation operator.
(4) FACTORING OF B BY (I)B = B:~ ~ B/,~To illustrate this, let B = /katab/; applyingthe function O(al,, Left) on B factors it into:(i) the kernel B:~ = /ka/,  and (ii) the residue1Other conventions associate consonant melodiesleft-to-right to the morale nodes, followed by associ-ating vowel melodies to syllable-initial morae.= /tab/.A morphological operation O (e.g.
O = "Pre-fix {t}") defined on a base B is denoted by O(B).There are two types of PC: positive (PPC) andnegat ive (NPC).
In PPC, the domain of the op-eration is tile kernel B:,IJ; this type is denoted byO:~ and is defined in (5a).
In NPC, the domainis the residue B/O; this type is denoted by 0/4)and is defined in (5b).
(5) DEFINITION OF PPC AND NPCa.
PPC,  O:O(B)  : O(B:~) ~ B /Ob.
NPC,  O /O(B)  = B:O ~ O(B/,I~)In other words, in PPC,  O applies to the ker-nel B:~, concatenating the result with the residueB/O;  in NPC,  O applies to the residue B/O,  con-catenating the result with the kernel B:O. Exam-ples are provided in section 3.1.2 Multi-Tape Two-Level FormalismTwo-level morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983) de-fines two levels of strings in recognition and syn-thesis: lexical strings represent morphemes, andsurface strings represent surface forms.
Two-levelrules map the two strings; the rules are compiledinto finite state transducers, where lexical stringssit on one tape of the transducers and surfacestrings on the other.Multi-tape two-level morphology is an extensionto standard two-level morphology, where morethan one lexical tape is allowed.
The notion of us-ing multiple tapes first appeared in (Kay, 1987).Motivated by Kay's work, (Kiraz, 1994) proposeda multi-tape two-level model.
The model adoptsthe formalism in (6) as reported by (Pulman andHepple, 1993).LLC LEX RLC {::~, ~}(6) LSC - SURI,' RSCwhere LLC is the left, lexical context, LEX is thelexical form, RLC is the right lexical context,LSC is the left surface context, SURF is the sur-face form, and RSC is the right surface context.The special symbol * indicates an empty con-text, which is always satisfied.
The operator =~states that LEX may surface as SURF in the givencontext, while the operator <=~ adds the conditionthat when LEx appears in the given context, thenthe surface description must satisfy SuR~.
Thelatter caters for obligatory rules.
A lexical stringmaps to a surface string iff (1) they call be par-titioned into pairs of lexical-surface subsequences,where each pair is licenced by a rule, and (2) nopartition violates an obligatory rule.665One of the extensions introduced in the multi-tape version is that all expressions in the lexicalside of the rules (i.e.
LLC, LEx and RLC) aren-tuple of regular expressions of the form (xl, x2,..., xn).
The ith expression refers to symbols onthe ith tape.
When n = 1, the parentheses can beignored; hence, (x) and x are equivalent.
22 Templat i c  Morpho logyTemplatic morphology is best exemplified inSemitic root-and-pattern morphology.
This sec-tion sets a framework under which templatic mor-phology can be described using (augmented) two-level theory.
Our presentation differs from pre-vious proposals a in that it employs prosodic mor-phology in the analysis of Arabic, rather than ear-lier CV accounts.
Arabic verbal forms appear in(7) in the passive (rare forms are not included).
(7) ARABIC VERBAL MEASURES (1-8, 10)1 kutib2 kuttib3 kuutib4 'euktib5 tukuttib6 tukuutib7 nkutib8 ktutib10 stuktib(McCarthy, 1993) points out that Arabic verbalforms are derived from the base template in (8),which represents Measure 1. a~ represents an ex-trametrical consonant; hai; is, the last consonantin a stein.
(8) ARABIC BASE TEMPLATEO- 0" O-mkut  ibThe remaining measures are derived from the basetemplate by afiqxation; they have no templates oftheir own.
The simplest operation is prefixation,e.g.
{n} + Measure 1 -+ /nkut ib/  (Measure 7).Measures 4 and 10 are derived in a similar fashion,but undergo a rule of syncope as shown in (9).2Our implementation interprets rules directly (see(Kiraz, 1996c)); hence, we allow unequal representa-tion of strings.
If the rules were to be compiled intoautomata, a genuine symbol, e.g.
0, must be intro-duced by the rule compiler.
For the compilation of ourformalism into automata, see (Grimley-Evans et al,1996).aNon-linear proposals include (Kay, 1987), (Kor-nai, 1991), (Wiebe, 1992), (Narayanan and Hashem,1993), (Bird and Ellison, 1994) and (Kiraz, 1994).A working system for Arabic is reported by (Beesleyet al, 1989; Beesley, 1990; Beesley, 1991).
(9) DERIVATION OF MEASURES 4 AND 10Syncope: V ~ q5/\[CVC __  CVC\]ste ma.
Measure 4: ~u + kntib ~ */eukutib/~Y2~ pe /~uktib/b.
Measure 10: stu + kutib*/stukutib/ ~Y2~ 'e /stuktib/The following lexicon and two-level grammardemonstrate how the above measures can be anal-ysed under two-level theory.
The lexicon main-tains four tapes: pattern, root, vocalism and affixtapes.1 {~.~,,<,:}2 {ktb}3 {ui}4 {~V}4 {n}4 {stV}pat tern  : \[measure= ( i -8 ,10)  \]root  : \[measure= (1 -4 ,6 -8 ,10)  \]voca l i sm:  \ [ tense=per f ,voice=pass\]verb_affix: \[measure=4\]verb_af f ix : \[measure=g\]verb_affix: \[measure=lO\]The first column indicates the tape on which themorpheme sits, and the second column gives themorpheme.
Eactl lexical entry is associated witha category and a feature structure of the formcat : FS (column 3).
Feature values in parenthesesare disjunctive and are implenlented using booleanvectors (Mellish, 1988; Pulman, 1994).
{a~a,,a~} is tile base-template.
{ktb} 'notionof writing' is the root; it may occur in all measuresapart from Measure 5.
4 {ui} is the perfective pas-sive vocalism.
Tile remaining morphemes repre-sent the affixes for Measures 4, 7 and 10.
Noticethat the vowel ill the affixes of Measures 4 and 10is a variable V. This maims it possible for the affixto have a different vowel according to the inood ofthe following stem, e.g.
\[a\] in /paktab/ (Measure4, active) and \[u\] in /pukt ib/ (Measure 4, passive).Since the lexicon declares 4 lexical tapes, eachlexical expression in the two-level grammar mustbe at most a 4-tuple.
A grammar for the deriva-tion of the cited data appears below.

11,ule R2 maps the extrmnetrieal conso-nant in a stem (i.e.
the last; consonant in a stem)to I;he sm'face.
Rule \]/,3 maps an atlix symbol fromthe fourth tap(', to the surface.
11,ules R4 and R5delete the boundary symbols fl'om stems and a ffixes, respectively.
Finally, rule R6 simulates thesyncoI)e rule in (9); note |;hat V ill LS~ must unifywith V in LEX, ensuring that the vowel of the af-fix has the same quality as that of the stem, e.g./ ' eaktab /a im /Pu+kt ib/  (measure 4).The two-level analysis of the cited forms ap-pears below ST = sm'face tape, PT -- patterntape, 115.\[' -- root tape, VT : vocal{sin tat)e , andAT = attix tape.Measure 1 Measure 4VT u \ [ i l  +I?,T k It Ib I+/PT I1 12  4 3 3 5 6 12  4\]kuiti lb\] \]ST \ [~ lu l  l k I t i lb \ [  \]Measm'e 7 Measure 10~i+l  AT I t l .

(Antworth, 1990, p. 156).
This sec-tion presents a framework for describing infixa-lion rules using our multi-tape two-level formal-ism.
This is illustrated here by analysing Mea-sures 2 and 8 of the Arabic verb.
Measure 2 , /kut -l ib/, is derived by prefixing a mora to the basetemplate under NI?C.
The operation is 0 = 'prefixi d and tile rule is ()/R~(a~, Left).
The new morais filled by the spreading of the adjacent (second)consonant.
The steps of the derivation are:O/~\ [~(kut ib )  = kut ib@ * ( ) (kut ib :{  0-- ku * O( t ib )= ku * / z t ib= ku * t t ib: kut t ibMeasure 8 , /k tut ib / ,  is derived by the aflixationof a {t} to the base template, under NP(\].
Theoperation is O = 'prefix {t}'; the rule is O/'I,(C,\[,eft;), where C is a consonant.
The process is:O/{ l} (kut ib ) - -  kutib:{I~ * O(kut ib :~):: k * O(ut ib )-- k * tutibktut ibThe following two-lew'J grammar builds on theone discussed in section 2.
The following lexiealentry gives the Measure 8 morpheums.4: { t}  verb_a l l  i x  : \ [measure=8\ ]The additional two-level rules are:<~,~,c,,v~,0 E - <~,~,c,*,c) -~I{7 * C *Features: \[measure= (2,5) \]?

Each ruh;is associated with a feature structure which mustunify with the feature structures of the affecl;edlexical entries.
This ensures that each rule is ap-plied only to the 1)roper ineasure.I1,7 handles Measm'e 2; it represents the opera-tion O -- 'prefix it' and the rule ( ) /~(a~, Left) byplacing B:~I~ in LLC and the residue B /~ in 11LC,and inserting a consonant C (representing t ~) onthe surface.
The filling o f / t  by the spreading ofthe second iadical is achieved by the unificationof C in LFx with C in RLC.I1,8 takes care  of Measure 8; it represents theoperation () -- 'prefix {t}' and the rule O/'l i(C,Left).
