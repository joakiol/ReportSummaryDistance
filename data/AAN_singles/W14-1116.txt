The main amount of the methodis related to the enrichment and adap-tation of linguistic resources to identifyTimex3 clinical expressions and to nor-malize them.
The test of the adapted ver-sions have been done on the i2b2/VA 2012corpus for English and a collection of clin-ical texts for French, which have been an-notated for the purpose of this study.
Weachieve a 0.8500 F-measure on the recog-nition and normalization of temporal ex-pressions in English, and up to 0.9431 inFrench.
Future work will allow to improveand consolidate the results.1 IntroductionWorking with unstructured narrative texts is verydemanding on automatic methods to access, for-malize and organize the information contained inthese documents.
The first step is the indexing ofthe documents in order to detect basic facts whichwill allow more sophisticated treatments (e.g., in-formation extraction, question/answering, visual-ization, or textual entailment).
We are mostly in-terested in indexing of documents from the med-ical field.
We distinguish two kinds of indexing:conceptual and contextual.Conceptual indexing consists in finding out thementions of notions, terms or concepts containedin documents.
It is traditionally done thanks tothe exploitation of terminological resources, suchas MeSH (NLM, 2001), SNOMED International(C?ot?e et al., 1993), SNOMED CT (Wang et al.,2002), etc.
The process is dedicated to the recog-nition of these terms and of their variants in doc-uments (Nadkarni et al., 2001; Mercer and DiMarco, 2004; Bashyam and Taira, 2006; Schulzand Hahn, 2000; Davis et al., 2006).The purpose of contextual indexing is to go fur-ther and to provide a more fine-grained annota-tion of documents.
For this, additional informa-tion may be searched in documents, such as polar-ity, certainty, aspect or temporality related to theconcepts.
If conceptual indexing extracts and pro-vides factual information, contextual indexing isaimed to describe these facts with more details.For instance, when processing clinical records, themedical facts related to a given patient can be aug-mented with the associated contextual informa-tion, such as in these examples:(1) Patient has the stomach aches.
(2) Patient denies the stomach aches.
(3) After taking this medication, patientstarted to have the stomach aches.
(4) Two weeks ago, patient experienced thestomach aches.
(5) In January 2014, patient experienced thestomach aches.In example (1), the information is purely fac-tual, while it is negated in example (2).
Example(3) conveys also aspectual information (the med-ical problem has started).
In examples (4) and(5), medical events are positioned in the time: rel-ative (two weeks ago) and absolute (in January2014).
We can see that the medical history of pa-tient can become more precise and detailed thanksto such contextual information.
In this way, fac-tual information related to the stomach aches ofpatient may receive these additional descriptionswhich make each occurrence different and non-redundant.
Notice that the previous I2B2 contests1addressed the information extraction tasks relatedto different kinds of contextual information.1https://www.i2b2.org/NLP101Temporality has become an important researchfield in the NLP topics and several challenges ad-dressed this taks: ACE (ACE challenge, 2004),SemEval (Verhagen et al., 2007; Verhagen et al.,2010; UzZaman et al., 2013), I2B2 2012 (Sunet al., 2013).
We propose to continue workingon the extraction of temporal information relatedto medical events.
This kind of study relies onseveral important tasks when processing the nar-rative documents : identification and normaliza-tion of linguistic expressions that are indicative ofthe temporality (Verhagen et al., 2007; Chang andManning, 2012; Str?otgen and Gertz, 2012; Kessleret al., 2012), and their modelization and chain-ing (Batal et al., 2009; Moskovitch and Shahar,2009; Pustejovsky et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2013;Grouin et al., 2013).
The identification of tempo-ral expressions provides basic knowledge for othertasks processing the temporality information.
Theexisting available automatic systems such as Hei-delTime (Str?otgen and Gertz, 2012) or SUTIME(Chang and Manning, 2012) exploit rule-basedapproaches, which makes them adaptable to newdata and areas.
During a preliminary study, wetested several such systems for identification oftemporal relations and found that HeidelTime hasthe best combination of performance and adapt-ability.
We propose to exploit this automatic sys-tems, to adapt and to test it on the medical clinicaldocuments in two languages (English and French).In the following of this study, we introducethe corpora (Section 2) and methods (Section 3).We then describe and discuss the obtained results(Section 4.2) and conclude (Section 5).2 MaterialCorpora composed of training and test sets are themain material we work with.
The corpora are intwo languages, English and French, and has com-parable sizes.
All the processed corpora are de-identified.
Corpora in English are built within theI2B2 2012 challenge (Sun et al., 2013).
The train-ing corpus consists of 190 clinical records and thetest corpus of 120 records.
The reference data con-tain annotations of temporal expressions accord-ing to the Timex3s guidelines: date, duration, fre-quency and time (Pustejovsky et al., 2010).
Cor-pora in French are built on purpose of this study.The clinical documents are issued from a Frenchhospital.
The training corpus consists of 182 clin-ical records and the test corpus of 120 records.
25documents from the test set are annotated to pro-vide the reference data for evaluation.3 MethodHeidelTime is a cross-domain temporal tagger thatextracts temporal expressions from documents andnormalizes them according to the Timex3 anno-tation standard, which is part of the markup lan-guage TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2010).
Thisis a rule-based system.
Because the source codeand the resources (patterns, normalization infor-mation, and rules) are strictly separated, it is pos-sible to develop and implement resources for ad-ditional languages and areas using HeidelTime?srule syntax.
HeidelTime is provided with modulesfor processing documents in several languages,e.g.
French (Moriceau and Tannier, 2014).
In En-glish, several versions of the system exist, such asgeneral-language English and scientific English.HeidelTime uses different normalization strate-gies depending on the domain of the documentsthat are to be processed: news, narratives (e.g.Wikipedia articles), colloquial (e.g.
SMS, tweets),and scientific (e.g.
biomedical studies).
The newsstrategy allows to fix the document creation date.This date is important for computing and normal-izing the relative dates, such as two weeks agoor 5 days later, for which the reference point intime is necessary: if the document creation date is2012/03/24, two weeks ago becomes 2012/03/10.Our method consists of three steps: tuning Hei-delTime to clinical data in English and French(Section 3.1), evaluation of the results (Section3.2), and exploitation of the computed data for thevisualization of the medical events (Section 3.3).3.1 Tuning HeidelTimeWhile HeidelTime proposes a good coverage ofthe temporal expressions used in general languagedocuments, it needs to be adapted to specializedareas.
We propose to tune this tool to the medi-cal domain documents.
The tuning is done in twolanguages (English and French).
Tuning involvesthree aspects:1.
The most important adaptation needed is re-lated to the enrichment and encoding of lin-guistic expressions specific to medical andespecially clinical temporal expressions, suchas post-operative day #, b.i.d.
meaning twicea day, day of life, etc.1022.
The admission date is considered as the refer-ence or starting point for computing relativedates, such as 2 days later.
For the identi-fication of the admission date, specific pre-processing step is applied in order to detect itwithin the documents;3.
Additional normalizations of the temporalexpressions are done for normalizing thedurations in approximate numerical valuesrather than in the undefined ?X?-value; andfor external computation for some durationsand frequencies due to limitations in Heidel-Time?s internal arithmetic processor.3.2 Evaluating the resultsHeidelTime is tuned on the training set.
It is evalu-ated on the test set.
The results generated are eval-uated against the reference data with:?
precision P: percentage of the relevant tem-poral expressions extracted divided by the to-tal number of the temporal expressions ex-tracted;?
recallR: percentage of the relevant temporalexpressions extracted divided by the numberof the expected temporal expressions;?
APR: the arithmetic average of the precisionand recall valuesP+R2;?
F-measure F : the harmonic mean of the pre-cision and recall valuesP?RP+R.3.3 Exploiting the resultsIn order to judge about the usefulness of the tem-poral information extracted, we exploit it to buildthe timeline.
For this, the medical events are asso-ciated with normalized and absolute temporal in-formation.
This temporal information is then usedto order and visualize the medical events.4 Experiments and Results4.1 ExperimentsThe experiments performed are the following.Data in English and French are processed.
Data intwo languages are processed by available versionsof HeidelTime: two existing versions (general lan-guage and scientific language) and the medicalversion created thanks to the work performed inthis study.
Results obtained are evaluated againstthe reference data.4.2 ResultsWe added several new rules to HeidelTime (164in English and 47 in French) to adapt the recog-nition of temporal expressions in medical docu-ments.
Some cases are difficult to annotate.
Forinstance, it is complicated to decide whether someexpressions are concerned with dates or durations.The utterance like 2 years ago (il y a 2 ans) isconsidered to indicate the date.
The utterance likesince 2010 (depuis 2010) is considered to indicatethe duration, although it can be remarked that thebeginning of the duration interval marks the begin-ning of the process and its date.
Another complexsituation appears with the relative dates:?
as already mentioned, date like 2 years ago(il y a 2 ans) are to be normalized accordingto the reference time point;?
a more complex situation appears with ex-pressions like the day of the surgery (le jourde l?op?eration) or at the end of the treatmentby antiobiotics (`a la fin de l?antibiothrapie),for which it is necessary first to make the ref-erence in time of the other medical event be-fore being able to define the date in question.In Table 1, we present the evaluation results forEnglish.
On the training corpus, with the generallanguage version and the scientific version of Hei-delTime, we obtain F-measure around 0.66: preci-sion (0.77 to 0.79) is higher than recall (0.56).
Thevalues of F-measure and APR are identical.
Theversion we adapted to the medical language pro-vides better results for all the evaluation measuresused: F-measure becomes then 0.84, with preci-sion up to 0.85 and recall 0.84.
This is a good im-provement of the automatic tool which indicatesthat specialized areas, such as medical area, useindeed specific lexicon and constructions.
Inter-estingly, on the test corpus, the results decreasefor the general language and scientific versionsof HeidelTime, but increase for the medical ver-sion of HeidelTime, with F-measure 0.85.
Duringthe I2B2 competition, the maximal F-measure ob-tained was 0.91.
With F-measure 0.84, our systemwas ranked 10/14 on the English data.
Currently,we improve these previous results.In Table 2, we present the results obtained onthe French test corpus (26 documents).
Two ver-sions of HeidelTime are applied: general lan-guage, that is already available, and medical, thathas been developed in the presented work.

au cours de, mensuel (during, monthly)).Among the current false positives, we can find ra-tios (2/10 is considered as date, while it means labresults), polysemous expressions (Juillet in rue du14 Juillet (14 Juillet street)), and segmentation errors(few days detected instead of the next few days).These limitations will be fixed in the future work.In Figure 1, we propose a visualization of thetemporal data, which makes use of the temporalinformation extracted.
In this way, the medicalevents can be ordered thanks to their temporal an-chors, which becomes a very useful informationpresentation in clinical practice (Hsu et al., 2012).The visualization of unspecified expressions (e.g.later, sooner) is being studied.
Although it seemsthat such expressions often occur with more spe-cific expressions (e.g.
later that day).5 ConclusionHeidelTime, an existing tool for extractingand normalizing temporal information, has beenadapted to the medical area documents in twolanguages (English and French).
It is evaluatedagainst the reference data, which indicates thatits tuning to medical documents is efficient: wereach F-measure 0.85 in English and up to 0.94in French.
More complete data in French are be-ing annotated, which will allow to perform a morecomplete evaluation of the tuned version.
We planto make the tuned version of HeidelTime freelyavailable.
Automatically extracted temporal infor-mation can be exploited for the visualization of theclinical data related to patients.
Besides, these datacan be combined with other kinds of contextual in-formation (polarity, uncertainty) to provide a moreexhaustive picture of medical history of patients.AcknowledgmentsThis work is partially performed under the grantANR/DGA Tecsan (ANR-11-TECS-012).
