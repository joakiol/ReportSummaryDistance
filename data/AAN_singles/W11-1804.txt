The IDtask represents an application and extensionof the BioNLP?09 shared task event extrac-tion approach to full papers on infectious dis-eases.
Seven teams submitted final results tothe task, with the highest-performing systemachieving 56% F-score in the full task, com-parable to state-of-the-art performance in theestablished BioNLP?09 task.
The results in-dicate that event extraction methods general-ize well to new domains and full-text publi-cations and are applicable to the extraction ofevents relevant to the molecular mechanismsof infectious diseases.1 IntroductionThe Infectious Diseases (ID) task of the BioNLPShared Task 2011 (Kim et al, 2011a) is an infor-mation extraction task focusing on the biomolecu-lar mechanisms of infectious diseases.
The primarytarget of the task is event extraction (Ananiadou etal., 2010), broadly following the task setup of theBioNLP?09 Shared Task (BioNLP ST?09) (Kim etal., 2009).The task concentrates on the specific domain oftwo-component systems (TCSs, or two-componentregulatory systems), a mechanism widely used bybacteria to sense and respond to the environment(Thomason and Kay, 2000).
Typical TCSs con-sist of two proteins, a membrane-associated sensorkinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator.
Thesensor kinase monitors changes in the environmentwhile the response regulator mediates an adaptiveresponse, usually through differential expression oftarget genes (Mascher et al, 2006).
TCSs have manyfunctions, but those of particular interest for infec-tious disease researchers include virulence, responseto antibiotics, quorum sensing, and bacterial cell at-tachment (Krell et al, 2010).
Not all TCS functionsare well known: in some cases, TCSs are involvedin metabolic processes that are difficult to preciselycharacterize (Wang et al, 2010).
TCSs are of in-terest also as drugs designed to disrupt TCSs mayreduce the virulence of bacteria without killing it,thus avoiding the potential selective pressure of an-tibiotics lethal to some pathogenic bacteria (Gotohet al, 2010).
Information extraction techniques maysupport better understanding of these fundamentalsystems by identifying and structuring the molecu-lar processes underlying two component signaling.The ID task seeks to address these opportuni-ties by adapting the BioNLP ST?09 event extractionmodel to domain scientific publications.
This modelwas originally introduced to represent biomolecu-lar events relating to transcription factors in humanblood cells, and its adaptation to a domain that cen-trally concerns both bacteria and their hosts involvesa variety of novel aspects, such as events concerningwhole organisms, the chemical environment of bac-teria, prokaryote-specific concepts (e.g.
regulons aselements of gene expression), as well as the effectsof biomolecules on larger-scale processes involvinghosts such as virulence.262 Task SettingThe ID task broadly follows the task definition andevent types of the BioNLP ST?09, extending it withnew entity categories, correspondingly broadeningthe scope of events, and introducing a new class ofevents, high-level biological processes.2.1 EntitiesThe ID task defines five core types of entities:genes/gene products, two-component systems, reg-ulons/operons, chemicals, and organisms.
Follow-ing the general policy of the BioNLP Shared Task,the recognition of the core entities is not part ofthe ID task.
As named entity recognition (NER)is considered in other prominent domain evaluations(Krallinger et al, 2008), we have chosen to isolateaspects of extraction performance relating to NERfrom the main task of interest, event extraction, byproviding participants with human-created gold an-notations for core entities.
These annotations arebriefly presented in the following.Mentions of names of genes and their products(RNA and proteins) are annotated with a singletype, without differentiating between subtypes, fol-lowing the guidelines of the GENIA GGP corpus(Ohta et al, 2009).
This type is named PRO-TEIN to maintain consistency with related tasks(e.g.
BioNLP ST?09), despite slight inaccuracyfor cases specifically referencing RNA or DNAforms.
Two-component systems, consisting of twoproteins, frequently have names derived from thenames of the proteins involved (e.g.
PhoP-PhoRor SsrA/SsrB).
Mentions of TCSs are annotated asTWO-COMPONENT-SYSTEM, nesting PROTEIN an-notations if present.
Regulons and operons are col-lections of genes whose expression is jointly regu-lated.
Like the names of TCSs, their names may de-rive from the names of the involved genes and pro-teins, and are annotated as embedding PROTEIN an-notations when they do.
The annotation does notdifferentiate between the two, marking both with asingle type REGULON-OPERON.In addition to these three classes relating to genesand proteins, the core entity annotation recognizesthe classes CHEMICAL and ORGANISM.
All men-tions of formal and informal names of atoms, inor-ganic compounds, carbohydrates and lipids as wellas organic compounds other than amino acid and nu-cleic acid compounds (i.e.
gene/protein-related com-pounds) are annotated as CHEMICAL.
Mentions ofnames of families, genera, species and strains aswell as non-name references with comparable speci-ficity are annotated as ORGANISM.Finally, the non-specific type ENTITY1 is definedfor marking entities that specify additional details ofevents such as the binding site in a BINDING event orthe location an entity moves to in a LOCALIZATIONevent.
Unlike the core entities, annotations of thegeneric ENTITY type are not provided for test dataand must be detected by participants addressing thefull task.2.2 RelationsThe ID task involves one relation, EQUIV, defin-ing entities (of any of the core types) to be equiv-alent.
This relation is used to annotate abbreviationsand local aliases and it is not a target of extraction,but provided for reference and applied in evaluation,where references to any of a set of equivalent entitiesare treated identically.2.3 EventsThe primary extraction targets of the ID task are theevent types summarized in Table 1.
These are a su-perset of those targeted in the BioNLP ST?09 and itsrepeat, the 2011 GE task (Kim et al, 2011b).
Thisdesign makes it possible to study aspects of domainadaptation by having the same extraction targets intwo subdomains of biomedicine, that of transcrip-tion factors in human blood cells (GE) and infectiousdiseases.
The events in the ID task extend on thoseof GE in the inclusion of additional entity typesas participants in previously considered event typesand the introduction of a new type, PROCESS.
Wenext briefly discuss the semantics of these events,defined (as in GE) with reference to the community-standard Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al, 2000).We refer to (Kim et al, 2008; Kim et al, 2009) forthe ST?09/GE definitions.1In terms of the GENIA ontology, ENTITY is used to marke.g.
PROTEIN DOMAIN OR REGION references.
Specific typeswere applied in manual annotation, but these were replacedwith the generic ENTITY in part to maintain consistency withBioNLP ST?09 data and to reduce the NER-related demandson participating systems by not requiring the assignment of de-tailed types.27Type Core arguments Additional argumentsGENE EXPRESSION Theme(PROTEIN or REGULON-OPERON)TRANSCRIPTION Theme(PROTEIN or REGULON-OPERON)PROTEIN CATABOLISM Theme(PROTEIN)PHOSPHORYLATION Theme(PROTEIN) Site(ENTITY)LOCALIZATION Theme(Core entity) AtLoc(ENTITY), ToLoc(ENTITY)BINDING Theme(Core entity)+ Site(ENTITY)+PROCESS Participant(Core entity)?REGULATION Theme(Core entity / Event), Cause(Core entity / Event)?

The type of entity allowed as argument is specified in parenthesis.
?Core en-tity?
is any of PROTEIN, TWO-COMPONENT-SYSTEM, REGULON-OPERON, CHEMICAL, or ORGANISM.
Argumentsthat can be filled multiple times marked with ?+?, non-mandatory core arguments with ???
(all additional argumentsare non-mandatory).The definitions of the first four types in Table 1are otherwise unchanged from the ST?09 definitionsexcept that GENE EXPRESSION and TRANSCRIP-TION extend on the former definition in recogniz-ing REGULON-OPERON as an alternative unit of ex-pression.
LOCALIZATION, taking only PROTEINtype arguments in the ST?09 definition, is allowedto take any core entity argument.
This expandeddefinition remains consistent with the scope of thecorresponding GO term (GO:0051179).
BINDINGis similarly extended, giving it a scope largely con-sistent with GO:0005488 (binding) but also encom-passing GO:0007155 (cell adhesion) (e.g.
a bac-terium binding another) and protein-organism bind-ing.
The three regulation types (REGULATION,POSITIVE REGULATION, and NEGATIVE REGULA-TION) likewise allow the new core entity types asarguments, but their definitions are otherwise un-changed from those in ST?09, that is, the GENIA on-tology definitions.
As in these resources, regulationtypes are used not only for the biological sense butalso to capture statements of general causality (Kimet al, 2008).
As in ST?09, all events of types dis-cussed above require a Theme argument: only eventsinvolving an explicitly stated theme (of an appropri-ate type) should be extracted.
All other argumentsare optional.The PROCESS type, new to ID, is used to annotatehigh-level processes such as virulence, infection andresistance that involve infectious organisms.
Thistype differs from the others in that it has no manda-tory arguments: the targeted processes should be ex-tracted even if they have no explicitly stated partici-pants, reflecting that they are of interest even withoutthe further specification.
When stated, the involvedparticipants are captured using the generic role typeParticipant.
Figure 1 shows an illustration of someof the the ID task extraction targets.We term the first five event types in Table 1 takingexactly one Theme argument as their core argumentsimple events.
In analysis we further differentiatenon-regulation events (the first seven) and regulation(the last three), which is known to represent partic-ular challenges for extraction in involving events asarguments, thus creating nested event structures.2.4 Event modificationsThe ID task defines two event modification ex-traction targets, NEGATION and SPECULATION.These modifications mark events as being explic-itly negated (e.g.
virB is not expressed) or stated ina speculative context (e.g.
virB may be expressed).Both may apply simultaneously.
The modificationdefinitions are identical to the ST?09 ones, includ-ing the representation in which modifications (un-like events) are not assigned text bindings.3 DataThe ID task data were newly annotated for theBioNLP Shared Task and are not based on any previ-ously released resource.
Annotation was performedby two teams, one in Tsujii laboratory (Universityof Tokyo) and one in Virginia Bioinformatics Insti-tute (Virginia Tech).

Detailed annotation guide-lines (Pyysalo et al, 2011) extending on the GE-NIA annotation guidelines were developed jointlywith all annotators and refined throughout the an-notation effort.
Based on measurements of inter-annotator consistency between annotations indepen-dently created by the two teams, made throughoutannotator training and primary annotation (exclud-ing final corpus cleanup), we estimate the consis-tency of the final entity annotation to be no lowerthan 90% F-score and that of the event annotation tobe no lower than 75% F-score for the primary eval-uation criteria (see Section 4).3.3 Datasets and statisticsInitial annotation was produced for the selected sec-tions (see Section 3.1) in 33 full-text articles, ofwhich 30 were selected for the final dataset as repre-sentative of the extraction targets.
These documentswere split into training, development and test sets of15, 5 and 10 documents, respectively.
Participantswere provided with all training and development setannotations and test set core entity annotations.
Theoverall statistics of the datasets are given in Table 4.As the corpus consists of full-text articles, it con-tains a somewhat limited number of articles, but inother terms it is of broadly comparable size to thelargest of the BioNLP ST corpora: the corpus wordcount, for example, corresponds to that of a cor-pus of approximately 800 PubMed abstracts, and thecore entity count is comparable to that in the ST?09data.
However, for reasons that may relate in part tothe domain, the event count is approximately a thirdof that for the ST?09 data.
In addition to having lesstraining data, the entity/event ratio is thus consider-ably higher (i.e.
there are more candidates for eachtrue target), suggesting that the ID data could be ex-pected to provide a more challenging extraction task.4 EvaluationThe performance of participating systems wasevaluated in terms of events using the standardprecision/recall/F-score metrics.
For the primaryevaluation, we adopted the standard criteria definedin the BioNLP?09 shared task.
In brief, for deter-mining whether a reference annotation and a pre-dicted annotation match, these criteria relax exactmatching for event triggers and arguments in twoways: matching of text-bound annotation (eventtriggers and ENTITY type entities) allows limitedboundary variation, and only core arguments need tomatch in nested event arguments for events to match.For details of the matching criteria, please refer toKim et al (2009).The primary evaluation for the task requires theextraction of all event arguments (both core and ad-ditional; see Table 1) as well as event modifications(NEGATION and SPECULATION).
This is termedthe full task.
We additionally report extraction re-sults for evaluation where both the gold standard ref-erence data and the submission events are reducedto only core arguments, event modifications are re-moved, and resulting duplicate events removed.
Weterm this the core task.
In terms of the subtask divi-sion applied in the BioNLP?09 Shared Task and theGE task of 2011, the core task is analogous to sub-task 1 and the full task analogous to the combinationof subtasks 1?3.5 Results5.1 ParticipationFinal results to the task were successfully submittedby seven participants.
Table 5 summarizes the in-formation provided by the participating teams.
Wenote that full parsing is applied in all systems, withthe specific choice of the parser of Charniak andJohnson (2005) with the biomedical domain modelof McClosky (2009) and conversion into the Stan-ford Dependency representation (de Marneffe et al,2006) being adopted by five participants.
Further,five of the seven systems are predominantly machinelearning-based.

In system design choices, wenote an indication of increased use of joint modelsas opposed to pure pipeline designs, with the threehighest-ranking systems involving a joint model.Several participants compiled dictionaries ofevent trigger words and two dictionaries of hedgewords from the data.
Four teams, including the threetop-ranking, used the GE task corpus as supplemen-tary material, indicating that the GE annotations arelargely compatible with ID ones (see detailed resultsbelow).
This is encouraging for future applicationsof the event extraction approach: as manual annota-tion requires considerable effort and time, the abilityto use existing annotations is important for the feasi-bility of adaptation of the approach to new domains.While several participants made use of support-ing syntactic analyses provided by the organizers(Stenetorp et al, 2011), none applied the analysesfor supporting tasks, such as coreference or entityrelation extraction results ?

For example, Stanford (McClosky etal., 2011) has relatively low performance for simpleevents but achieves the highest result for PROCESS,while UTurku (Bjo?rne and Salakoski, 2011) resultsshow roughly the reverse.

Best result for each type shown in bold.The best performance for simple events and forPROCESS approaches or exceeds 70% F-score, ar-guably approaching a sufficient level for user-facingapplications of the extraction technology.
By con-trast, BINDING and regulation events, found chal-lenging in ST?09 and GE, remain problematic alsoin the ID task, with best overall performance below50% F-score.
Only two teams, UTurku and Con-cordU (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2011), attempted toextract event modifications, with somewhat limitedperformance.
The difficulty of correct extraction ofevent modifications is related in part to the recursivenature of the problem (similarly as for nested reg-ulation events): to extract a modification correctly,the modified event must also be extracted correctly.Further, only UTurku predicted any instances of sec-ondary arguments.
Thus, teams other than UTurkuand ConcordU addressed only the core task extrac-tion targets.
With the exception of ConcordU, allsystems clearly favor precision over recall (Table 7),in many cases having over 15% point higher preci-sion than recall.
This a a somewhat unexpected in-version, as the ConcordU system is one of the tworule-based in the task, an approach typically associ-ated with high precision.The five top-ranking systems participated also inthe GE task (Kim et al, 2011b), which involves asubset of the ID extraction targets.
This allows ad-ditional perspective into the relative performance ofthe systems.
While there is a 13% point spread inoverall results for the top five systems here, in GEall these systems achieved F-scores ranging between50?56%.
The results for FAUST, UMass and Stan-ford were similar in both tasks, while the ConcordUresult was 6% points higher for GE and the UTurkuresult over 10% points higher for GE, ranking thirdafter FAUST and UMass.
These results suggest thatwhile the FAUST and UMass systems in particularhave some systematic (e.g.
architectural) advantageat both tasks, much of the performance differenceobserved here between the top three systems andthose of ConcordU and UTurku is due to strengthsor weaknesses specific to ID.
Possible weaknessesmay relate to the treatment of multiple core entitytypes (vs. only PROTEIN in GE) or challenges re-lated to nested entity annotations (not appearing inGE).
A possible ID-specific strength of the threetop-ranking systems is the use of GE data for train-ing: Riedel and McCallum (2011) report an esti-mated 7% point improvement and McClosky et al(2011) a 3% point improvement from use of thisdata; McGrath et al (2011) estimate a 1% point im-provement from direct corpus combination.

The top-rankingfive systems all participated also in the EPI task(Ohta et al, 2011), for which UTurku ranked firstwith FAUST having comparable performance for thecore task.
While this supports the conclusion thatID performance differences do not reflect a simpleuniversal ranking of the systems, due to many sub-stantial differences between the ID and EPI setups itis not straightforward to identify specific reasons forrelative differences to performance at EPI.Table 8 summarizes the core task results.
Thereare only modest and largely consistent differences tothe corresponding full task results, reflecting in partthe relative sparseness of additional arguments: inthe training data, for example, only approximately3% of instances of event types that can potentiallytake additional arguments had at least one additionalargument.
While event modifications represent afurther 4% of full task extraction targets not requiredfor the core task, the overall low extraction perfor-mance for additional arguments and modificationslimits the practical effect of these annotation cate-gories on the performance difference between sys-tems addressing only the core targets and those ad-dressing the full task.6 Discussion and ConclusionsWe have presented the preparation, resources, re-sults and analysis of the Infectious Diseases (ID)task of the BioNLP Shared Task 2011.
A corpusof 30 full-text publications on the two-componentsystems subdomain of infectious diseases was cre-ated for the task in a collaboration of event annota-tion and domain experts, adapting and extending theBioNLP?09 Shared Task (ST?09) event representa-tion to the domain.Seven teams submitted final results to the ID task.Despite the novel challenges of full papers, four newentity types, extension of event scopes and the intro-duction of a new event category for high-level pro-cesses, the highest results for the full ID task werecomparable to the state-of-the-art performance onthe established ST?09 data, showing that the eventextraction approach and present systems generalizewell and demonstrating the feasibility of event ex-traction for the infectious diseases domain.
Analy-sis of results suggested further opportunities for im-proving extraction performance by combining thestrengths of various systems and the use of otherevent resources.The task design takes into account the needsof supporting practical applications, and its resultsand findings will be adopted in future developmentof the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center4(PATRIC).
Specifically, PATRIC will combine do-main named entity recognition and event extractionto mine the virulence factor literature and integratethe results with literature search and retrieval ser-vices, protein feature analysis, and systems such asDisease View.5 Present and future advances at theID event extraction task can thus assist biologists inefforts of substantial public health interest.The ID task will be continued as an openshared task challenge with data, supporting re-sources, and evaluation tools freely available fromthe shared task site, http://sites.google.com/site/bionlpst/.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Spe-cially Promoted Research (MEXT, Japan).
