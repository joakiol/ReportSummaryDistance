The Mul t i s tore  system was deve loped in order to recogenize and expla in structural  patterns in natural-languagesentences (speci f ical ly  English) and eventually yield anoutput  in which  the re lat ions  between the var ious  items ofthe sentence are h ie rarch ica l ly  d isp layed.The recogn i t ion  of these st ructura l  patterns  is made bymeans of a system of rules which operate  on a sequence ofwords, i.e.
a sentence, whose ind iv idual  character i s t i csare pre-estab l i shed.
By ind iv idual  character i s t i cs  are meantthe poss ib i l i t ies  a word has to cor re la te  (i.e.
to form asyntact ic  combinat ion) wi th another item; these poss i -b i l i t ies  are represented by 'correlators' ,  that  is, bysyntact ic  e lements which l ink two items in a cor re la t ion .Each word is character i zed  by a set of p re -es tab l i sheddata:a) the S-code, which d is t ingu ishes  between the var ioussenses of a homograph.
For instance, a word l ike "READ"wi l l  have four d i f fe rent  S's to d i s t ingu ish  between:READ = supine e.g.
I CAN READREAD = past tense YESTERDAY I READREAD = past  part.
I HAVE READREAD = noun A LONG READThese d is t inct ions  are essent ia l , ' s ince  whenever  a homo-graph occurs, one and only one of i ts mean ings  can betaken into cons iderat ion  to make the f inal  pattern,  un-less, of course, the sentence is ambiguous  and more than- 2 -one f inal  pattern is to be recognized,  as in:i) present  tenseI READ THE BOOKii) past tenseb) the sequence of corre lat ional  indices (Ic's), that is,the str ing of potent ia l  l inks that each word-sense has.Each Ic represents  a poss ib le  syntact ic  connect ion be-tween two items and is ident i f ied by:i) the code number of the re lat ion it establ ishes betweentwo items;2) the 'type' of correlat ion.
There are six d i f ferent  typesof corre lat ion which  spl it  into two groups: 'expl ic i t 'corre lators  and 'implicit' correlators.By 'explicit' corre lator  we mean a l ink ing element which isrepresented by a l inguist ic  item; prepos i t ions  and conjunct -ions are expl ic i t  correlators;  by ' implicit' corre lator  wemean a re lat ion between two items, which is not expressedby any l inguist ic  i tem but is ind icated by the re lat ive po-s i t ion of the two items (which we cal l  their  corre lat iona lfunction).Type NType MType VIMPLICIT CORRELATORI ?

When two adjacent  words have complementary  funct ionsof the same Ic - for instance, word A has 5050 N1 and word Bhas 5050 N2 - a 'product' is made and recorded in the form:Word A 5050 N Word BThis product  is cons idered as one piece and can becomef irst  or second cor re la tum in a wider corre lat ion  and istherefore  treated as though it were a s ingle word, i.e., itis ass igned str ings of Ic's which indicate its cor re lat ion-al poss ib i l i t ies  both with ad jacent  words and with ad jacentproducts  a l ready made.
S ingle words, however,  being vocabu-lary items, have their  str ings of Ic's ass igned a priori;products,  s ince they ar ise dur ing the procedure,  have tobe ass igned their  Ic -st r ings dynamic&l ly .
The ass ignat ionof speci f ic  Ic's to a product  depends on:a) the corre lator  respons ib le  for the par t icu lar  correlat ion;b) the character i s t i cs  (Ic's) of the word (or product) whichG2t .
,- 4 -makes up the f irst  or the second correlatum.The operat ional  cycle that assigns Ic's to a product  wecal l  ' reclassi f icat ion' .The amount of data involved in an analys is  of this kindis real ly  enormous.
Let us consider  a sentence cons ist ingof ten words, each of which has two d i f ferent  senses (S's).On an average 50 corre lat ional  indices are ass igned to eachsense of a word.
Now, just to check the corre lat iona l  com-pat ib i l i ty  of two adjacent words about 10,000 matching op-erat ions would be necessary; the matching procedure for allthe words of the sentence would involve about 90,000 oper-ations.
On an average five products would resul t  f rom thef irst 10,000 match ing operat ions;  each of them would be as-s igned about 50 corre lat ional  indices that represent  theproduct 's  corre lat iona l  poss ib i l i t ies  to corre late wi th aanother adjacent piece - either a word or a product.
Theprocedure to match these five products  wi th another piecewould involve about 637,000 operat ions.
If to this f igure~we add the number of operat ions necessary  start ing fromlevel 3 (see p. 7) with all the products  made in the imme-d iate ly  preceding levels (200,000), the total number ofoperat ions involved would come to 927,000.The rec lass i f i cat ion  rout ine also involves a great num-ber of operat ions  of this kind: about half of the correla-t ional  indices a product  is ass igned depends on the corre-- 5 -lator respons ib le  for that correlat ion;  the other half de-pends on the str ings of indices which the two corre lata ofthe product  have.
Accord ing  to the presence or absence ofspec i f ic  indices in the str ings of the f irst or second cor-relatum, pre -es tab l i shed  sets of indices are ass igned tothe product;  or sets of indices are ass igned to the productonly if they are present  in the str ings of its two corre-lata.
The rec lass i f i ca t ion  of each product  would requireabout 2,000 operat ions,  which  means 100,000 for the averageof 50 products  in a sentence of i0 words, br inging the to-tal of operat ions  to over a mi l l i on  onl\[  for the match in~procedure.
This would imply - for this part of the programalone - process ing t imes of the order of some seconds ofmach ine  t ime if the most  modern computer  is avai lable,  orof about an hour - at best  - if the work is done with ano lder  model.The amount of work and money involved in a procedure ofthis kind made us try to f ind a quicker and more economicalway of handl ing cor re la t iona l  indices: as a resul t  of oure f for ts  the Mul t i s tore  system was developed.
(  Bibl.
i)The basic idea of the Mu l t i s to re  consists  in pre-estab~l ish ing in a g iven area of the machine 's  central  core asmany separate pos i t ions  as there ard corre lators  in thesystem.
The ar rangement  of these pos i t ions  represent ing thecor re la tors  orders them accord ing to type.
This assuresthat at any point  of the procedure  each Ic is not used sev-- 6 -eral t imes and in d i f ferent  ways accord ing to the d iversedata it contains,  but only as one single item which by itspos i t ional  coord inate~ implies its var ious s igni f icat ions.Moreover,  the Ic's do not have to be compared one by onewith the Ic's of other adjacent  words or products,  but ares imply addressed to one and only one pre-estab l i shed posi-tion.
Thus the mass of operat ions of compar ison is avoidedand also the necess i ty  to ascertain,  after every successfulmatch, which items the matched Ic's represent  is e l iminat-ed, because the very pos i t ion of the matched Ic's immediate-ly impl ies what they stand for.
To establ ish whether  two .Ic's are complementaryand represent  a corre lat ion  thus be-comes the simple task of checking a l ready present informa-tion according to the rules of sequence, of corre lat iona lfunction, and of  corre lator  type, al l  of which are impl ic i tin the locat ion of the markers  which are being handled.The Mul t i s tore  can be represented as a rectangular  aread iv ided into l ines and columns.

i i iLn - I  t J I ~ ' " i  'm- 7 -Every column is ded icated to one Ic and subdiv ided into twosubcolumns,  if the Ic is of type N, M, or V (implicit); ifthe Ic is of type E, F, or H (explicit),  the column is di-v ided into three subcolumns.The l ines LI, L2, L3 etc.
d iv ide the area into levels.
Thelevels are determined by the success ion of words in input.Thus each level bears the number of the word it represents .Every input word causes for each Ic in its Ic str ing theinsert ion of a marker  into the Mul t is tore  column correspond-ing to that Ic; and the level of that marker  in the Ic col-umn corresponds to the input number and the pos i t ion ofthat word in the sentence.
Thus all  the markers  insertedfor one word represent  the corre lat iona l  poss ib i l i t ies  ofthat  word.If, on the l ine of level i, an Ic of the str ing represent-ing corre lator  type N of the f i rst  word has caused the in-sert ion of a marker  into the column corresponding to thatIc and if an Ic of str ing N of the second word has causedthe inser t ion , in to  the l ine of level two, of a marker  re-present ing  CF2 of the same Ic, this impl ic i t ly  means thatwith the same corre lator  a cor re la t ion  is made conta in ingthe f irst  and the second word; this product  No x, cons ist -ing of word 1 (S 'a\[) and word  2 (S .
'b') is the product  ofcor re lator  No y and type N. This product  belongs to level2 and when it has been ass igned a str ing of Ic's by theappropr ia te  rules of rec lass i f i cat ion ,  it wi l l  be inserted8 -into the Mul t i s tore  on the second level; this means thatit can enter into combinat ions only with those words thatbelong to the immediate ly  preceding level, or with productswhich contain the words of the immediate ly  preceding level.Such a correlat ion,  whenever  it is made, would sti l l  be longto the level of product  x.
In our speci f ic  case product  xcould corre late only with an item of level zero, which doesnot exist, because product  x is on level two and alreadycontains word No.
i.
Hence we can formulate a rest r ic t iverule to the ef fect  that a product  can be a potent ia l  secondcorre latum in an N corre lat ion only if its lower level islarger than 1.
The Mul t i s tore  system lends i tsel f  to theintroduct ion of many such rest r ic t ion rules.When on a g iven level all products  that have sprung fromthe insert ion of markers  corresponding to the word of thatlevel have been rec lass i f ied ,and the products  or ig inat ingfrom that rec lass i f i cat ion  have, in turn, been rec lass i f iedand have inserted their  markers,  and there are no more prod-ucts to be reclass i f ied,  then the procedure inserts the nextword and thus begins the next level.
This means that oncea subsequent word of the sentence has been inserted, allpreceding words and products  become 'inactive' pieces, hav-ing exhausted every poss ib le attempt of corre lat ion with'active' pieces; from then on they represent  mere ly  latentcorre lat iona l  poss ib i l i t ies  with subsequent items.
Thisstate of inact iv i ty  in the case of the last word of the sen-- 9 -tence determines  the end of the analysis .
At  this  po intthe product  (or products) that conta ins  al l  words  of thesentence is ca l led  'complete' and represents  the h ierarch-ical  s t ructure  of the sentence.The f i rst  tentat ive  program MP1 (Bibl.
i) was wr i t tenfor use on a GE 425 computer  and its main  purpose  was toshow the app l i cab i l i ty  of the Mu l t i s to re  system to corre-la t iona l  grammar and to check the method of p rogrammingbased on 's igni f icant  addresses ' .The present  program, MP2 (Bibl.
3) , is a rev ised  anden larged vers ion  of MPI  wr i t ten  for use on an IBM 360/67computer .
On the bas is  of our prev ious  exper ience  it canbe cons idered  an actual  work ing  too l .Many  solut ions,  as wel l  as many rest ra ints ,  depend onthe fact that under  many respects  it is a mach ine-or ient -ed program.
The program is s t ructured on a large area ofthe cent ra l  core, d iv ided  into l ines and columns,  whoses ize is 528 x 330 bytes.
Each l ine (330 al l  together)cons is ts  of 528 bytes and is d iv ided  into two sect ions:A and B. Sect ion  A conta ins  al l  the data  necessary  todef ine  a line; sect ion B cons is ts  of 496 bytes, that is,of as many bytes as there are cor re lators  operat ive  in theisystem.
Each l ine spec i f ies  as permanent  data a rec lass i -f i ca t ion  rule - whose def in i t ion  is g iven in sect ion  A ofthe same l ine - and the set of indices ass igned by thatru le  (bit 6).

3Bits 1 to 4 are therefore used in the matching procedure,whereas bit,5 and 6 are pre-established data to be usedin the reclassification routine.- i i  -ProcedureEach  S-va lue of a word occupies  one l ine of the Mul t i -s tore area and its spec i f i ca t ions  are recorded in sect ionA of the same line.
For each Ic conta ined in the str ing ofthat  S -va lue  of the word, a marker  is inserted , accord ingto the cor re la t iona l  funct ion,  in b i t  1,2 or 3 of the cor-respond ing  byte of the l ine, that is, in the byte whichbears that Ic as label.Accord ing  to its funct ion,  a marker  can be a le f t -handp iece  'LH', and as such it~is s imply recorded,  or a r ight -hand p iece 'RH', in wh ich  case, immediate ly  after  it hasbeen recorded,  the co lumn is searched for a complementaryand cont iguous  LH piece.
If this is found, an ind icat ionof product  is recorded in the f i rs t  f ree l ine of the Mul t i -store; this address cons is ts  of three data: a) the addressof the l ine where  the LH p iece was found, wh ich  is recordedin the area 'f irst cor re la tum' ;o f  the l ine of the product;b) the address  of the l ine where the RH piece was recorded,wh ich  is recorded in the area 'second correlatum' and c)the re la t ive  address  of the co lumn which  character izes  bothboth LH and RH pieces,  wh ich  is recorded in the area 'cor-re lator ' .A f ter  the product ' s  spec i f i ca t ibns  are recorded,  andif there are no other LH p ieces wi th  wh ich  the RH p iece inhand can combine,  the rout ine  for the insert ion of Ic's isresumed.

Three d i f ferentk inds of output  are produced:a) a l ist of al l  the products  made in the course of theanalys is  of the sentence;b) a l ist of al l  Ic's ass igned to each product  dur ing therec lass i f i ca t ion  rout ine ;c) a graphic  representat ion  of the h ierarch ica l  structureof all 'complete' products  (that is, conta in ing allwords of the sentence).
This structure is equiva lent  toa tree structure wi th  words at the terminals  and corre-lators at the nodes.
(see Appendix)This is a general  out l ine of the procedure of combina-tion, product ion,  rec lass i f i ca t ion  and output.
In addi t ionto that there are several  rout ines which meet special  re-quirements.
A specia l  rule, for instance prevents speci f icRH pieces from becoming e l ig ib le  LII p ieces once a certa incor re la t ion  - which conta ins  them as RH pieces - has beenmade.
A word l ike "LITTLE", for instance, in its funct ionas a quant i f ier ,  once it has been corre lated with the de~f in i te art ic le and made the product  "THE//L ITTLE" cannotbecome LH piece in the correlat ion:L ITTLE // HE KNOWSL16The ind icat ion 'discard' on pr in t -out  type 'a' - i.e.
onthe l ist of all the products  made dur ing the analys is  -wi l l  show that "LITTLE" is no more  ava i lab le  as LH p iecefor any other corre lat ion.
?Another  rest ra int  concerns some 'complete' productswhich, though grammat ica l ly  correct,  cannot  be acceptedas in terpretat ion  of the sentence.
For instance,  in asentence like:THEY / /  WERE READYthe structure which takes "WERE" as sub junct ive  is notacceptable,  s ince it would  requ i re  someth ing else - an"IF" or "I WISH" etc.
- to precede.
In cases l ike thisthe ind icat ion 'non-sentence' appears in pr in t -out  typel a l  ,A set of specia l  rout ines serves the purpose of rec-ogniz ing id iomat ic  express ions.
When one of them is rec-ognized, inserted in the Mu l t i s to re  and rec lass i f ied  - l ikeany other product  - the ind icat ion  'idiom' is p r in ted  onpr in t -out  type 'a'The whole  program, inc lud ing the Mu l t i s to re  area andbuffers,  is conta ined in the centra l  core of the mach ineand occupies  about 200 K. The system accepts  as input ,sen-17tences of up to 16 words - a l imit f ixed in accordance wi ththe average length of sentences in  sc ient i f ic  texts  (Bibl.5)and ample enough to a l low any type of syntact ic  structure.P rocess ing- t imes  for 10-word sentences are about 1-1.5 sec-onds.
Our present  vocabu lary  is l imited to 150 words forreasons of punched card maintenance.
However,  it could  been larged wi thout  a f fect ing the program.The Mu l t i s to re  parser  was developed for the automat icanalys is  of Engl ish  sentences on the basis  of cor re lat ion-al grammar,  but it is in no way l imited to this k ind ofgrammar.
