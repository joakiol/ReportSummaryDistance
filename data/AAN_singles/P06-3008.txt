The rhetorical patterns ofthese marks are compared against patternsaround cue phrases in general.
Resultsshow that these Chinese punctuationmarks, though fewer in number than cuephrases, are easy to identify, have strongcorrelation with certain relations, and canbe used as distinctive indicators ofnuclearity in Chinese texts.1 IntroductionRhetorical structure has been proven useful inNLP projects such as text generation,summarization, machine translation and essayscoring.
Automatic discourse parsing remains anelusive task, however, despite much rule-basedresearch on lexical cues such as anaphora andconjunctions.
Parsing through machine learninghas encountered a bottleneck, due to limitedresources--there is only one English RSTtreebank publicly available, and oneRST-annotated German corpus on its way.Punctuation marks (PMs) have been provenuseful in RST annotation as well as in many otherNLP tasks such as Part-of-Speech tagging, WordSense Disambiguation, Near-duplicate detection,bilingual alignment (e.g.
Chuang and Yeh, 2005),etc.
Dale (1991) noticed the role of PMs indetermining rhetorical relations.
Say (1998) did astudy on their roles in English discourse structure.Marcu (1997) and Corston-Oliver (1998) basedtheir automatic discourse parser partially on PMsand other orthographical cues.
Tsou et al (1999)and Chan et al (2000) use PMs to disambiguatecandidate Discourse Markers for a Chinesesummarization system.
Reitter (2003) also usedPMs to distinguish ATTRIBUTION andELABORATION relations in his Feature-richSVM rhetorical analysis system.All these inspired us to survey on the rhetoricalpatterns around Chinese PMs, so as to providemore direct a priori scores for the coarserhetorical analyzer by Zhang et al (2000) in theirhybrid summarization system.This paper is organized into 5 parts: Section 2gives an overview of a Chinese RST treebankunder construction, and a survey on the syntax ofsix main PMs in the corpus: Colon, Dash,Ellipses, Exclamation Mark, Question Mark, andSemicolon.
Section 3 reports rhetorical patternsaround these PMs.
Section 4 is a discussion on theeffectiveness of these PMs in comparison withChinese cue phrases.
Section 5 is a summary andSection 6 directions for future work.2 Overview of Chinese RST treebankunder construction2.1 Corpus dataFor the purpose of language engineering andlinguistic investigation, we are constructing aChinese corpus comparable to the EnglishWSJ-RST treebank and the German PotsdamCommentary Corpus (Carlson et al 2003; Stede2004).
Texts in our corpus were downloadedfrom the official website of People?s Daily 1 ,where important Caijingpinlun2 (CJPL) articles1 www.people.com.cn.2 Caijinpinglun (CJPL) in Chinese means ?financial andbusiness commentary?, and usually covers various topics insocial economic life, such as fiscal policies, financial reports,43by major media entities were republished.
Withover 400 authors and editors involved, our textscan be regarded as a good indicator of the generaluse of Chinese by Mainland native speakers.At the moment our CJPL corpus has a total of395 texts, 785,045 characters, and 84,182punctuation marks (including pruned spaces).Although on average there are 9.3 charactersbetween every two marks, sentences in CJPL arelong, with 51.8 characters per common sentencedelimiters (Full Stop, Question Mark andExclamation Mark).2.2 SegmentationWe are informed of the German PotsdamCommentary Corpus construction, in which they(Reitter 2003) designed a program for automaticsegmentation at clausal level after eachSign=?$.?
(including {., ?, !, ;, :, ?})
andSign=?$,?
(including {,}) 3 .
Human interferencewith the segmentation results was not allowed,but annotators could retie over-segmented bits byusing the JOINT relation.Given the workload of discourse annotation,we decided to design a similar segmentationprogram.
So we first normalized differentencoding systems and variants of PMs (e.g.Dashes and Ellipses of various lengths), and thenconducted a survey on the distribution (Fig.
1)and syntax of major Chinese punctuation marks(e.g.
syntax of Chinese Dash in Table 1).0.0%5.0%10.0%15.0%20.0%25.0%30.0%35.0%40.0%PeriodExclamationQuestionComma-1Comma-2ColonSemicolonDash-halfEllipsis-Quote-LQuote-RParen-LParen-RSpaceOther PMRateintotalPMsFigure 1: Percentage of major punctuationmarks in the Chinese corpus4C-Comma-1 is the most frequently used PM inthe Chinese corpus.
While it does delimit clauses,a study on 200 randomly selected C-Comma-1tokens in our corpus shows that 55 of them aretrading, management, economic conferences, transportation,entertainment, education, etc.Collected by professional editors, most texts in our corpusare commentaries; some are of marginal genres by theChinese standards.3 Dash, as a Sign= ?$(?, was not selected as a unit delimiterin the Potsdam Commentary Corpus.4 PMs are counted by individual symbols.used after an independent NP or discoursemarker.
This rate, times the total number ofC-Comma-1, means we would have to retie ahuge number of over-segmented elements.
So wedecided not to take C-Comma-1 as a delimiter ofour Elementary Unit of Discourse Analysis(EUDA) for the present.Structure of C-?

Other than these,56.5% of the colons are used between clausalstrings, only 0.6% of the colons are used afternon-clausal strings.99.6% instances of Exclamation Mark,Question Mark, Dash, Ellipses and Semicolon inthe Chinese corpus are used after clausal strings.In our corpus, 4.3% of the left quotation marksdo not have a right match to indicate the end of aquote.
Because many articles do not give clearindications of direct or indirect quotes7, it is verydifficult for the annotator to makeup.Parentheses and brackets have a similarproblem, with 3.2% marks missing their matches.5 The symbol ?S?
donates sentences with a common endmark, while ?s?
denotes structures orthographically end withone of the PMs studied here.
?+?
means one or moreoccurrences, ?*?
means zero or more occurrences.
Thecategory after a bracket pair indicates the syntactic roleplayed by the unit enclosed, for example ?[??]NP?
meansthe ellipses functions as an NP within a clausal structure.?<para></para>?
denotes paragraph opening and ending.6 By ?Structural elements?
we mean documentaryinformation, such as Publishing Date, Source, Link, Editor,etc.
Although these are parts of a news text, they are not thearticle proper, on which we annotate rhetorical relations.7 After a comparative study on the rhetorical structure ofnews published by some Hong Kong newspapers in bothEnglish and Chinese, Scollon and Scollon (1997) observedthat ?quotation is at best ambiguous in Chinese.
No standardpractice has been observed across newspapers in this set andeven within a newspaper, it is not obvious which portions ofthe text are attributed to whom.?
We notice that Mainlandnewspapers have a similar phenomenon.44Besides, 53.9% of the marks appear in structuralelements that we didn?t intend to analyze8.Finally, we decided to use Period, theEnd-of-line symbol, and these six marks(Question Mark, Exclamation Mark, Colon,Semicolon, Ellipsis and Dash) as delimiters ofour EUDA.
Quotation mark, Parentheses, andBrackets were not selected.A special program was designed to conductthe segmentation after each delimiter, withproper adjustment in cases when the delimiter isimmediately followed by a right parenthesis, aright quotation mark, or another delimiter.A pseudo-relation, SAME-UNIT, has been usedduring annotation to re-tie any discourse segmentcut by the segmentation program into fragments.2.3 Annotation and Validity ControlWe use O?Donnell?s RSTTool V3.43 9  as ourannotation software.
We started from theExtended-RST relation set embedded in thesoftware, adding gradually some new relations,and finally got an inventory of 47 relations.
Wetake the same rhetorical predicate with switchedarguments as different relations, for instance,SOLUTIONHOOD-S, SOLUTIONHOOD-M andSOLUTIONHOOD-N are regarded as 3 relations.Following Carlson et al (2001) and Marcu?s(1999) examples, we?ve composed a 60-pageChinese RST annotation manual, which includespreprocessing procedures, segmentation rules,definitions and examples of the relations, tagdefinitions for structural elements, taggingconventions for special structures, and a relationselection protocol.
When annotating, we choosethe most indicative relation according to themanual.
Trees are constructed with binarybranches except for multinuclear relations.One experienced annotator had sketched treesfor all the 395 files before the completion of themanual.
Then she annotated 97 shortest filesfrom 197 randomly selected texts, workingindependently and with constant reference to themanual.
After a one-month break, shere-annotated the 97 files, with reference to themanual and with occasional consultation withChinese journalists and linguists.
The lastversion, though far from error-free, is currentlytaken as the right version for reliability tests andother statistics.8 Parentheses, and other PMs used in structural elements ofCJPL texts, are of high relevance to discourse parsing, sincethey can be used in a preprocessor to filter out textfragments that do not need be annotated in terms of RST.9 Publicly downloadable at www.wagsoft.com.An intra-coder accuracy test has bee takenbetween the 1st and 2nd versions of 97 finishedtrees.
The intra-coder accuracy rate (Rv) for aparticular variable is defined asRv=  *100%2*(AT-AS)TT-TSWhereAT= number of agreed tags;TT= number of total tags;TS= number of total tags for structuralelements;AS= number of agreed tags for structuralelements.Rr for relation tags is 84.39%, Ru for unit tags is85.61%, and Rn for nuclearity tags is 88.12%.Because SPSS can only calculate KappaCoefficient for symmetric data, we?ve onlymeasured Kappa for relation tags to the EUDAs.The outcome, Kr=.738, is quite high.3 ResultsThe 97 double-annotated files have in the mainbody of their texts a total of 677 paragraphs and1,914 EUDAs.
Relational patterns of those PMsare reported in Table 2-7 below10.
The ?N?, ?S?or ?M?
tags after each relation indicate thenuclearity status of each EUDA ended with acertain PM.

Butsome PMs have dominant rhetorical usages.2) C-Question Mark is not most frequentlyrelated with SOLUTIONHOOD, but withCONJUNCTION.
That is because a highpercentage of questions in our corpus arerhetorical and used in groups to achievecertain argumentative force.3) C-Colon is most frequently related withATTRIBUTION and ELABORATION, apartfrom its usage in structural elements.4) C-Semicolon is overwhelmingly associatedwith multinuclear relations, particularly withCONJUNCTION.5) C-Dash usually indicates an ELABORATIONrelation.
But since it is often used in pairs, itis often bound to both the Nucleus andSatellite units of a relation.6) 82.3% tokens of the six Chinese PMs areuniquely related to EUDAs of certainnucleus status in a rhetorical relation, takingeven C-Dash into account.7) The following relations have more than 10%of their instances related to one of the sixPMs studied here: ADDITION,ATTRIBUTION, CONJUNCTION,DISJUNCTION, ELABORATION, LIST,OTHERWISE, PREPARTION,RESTATEMENT and SOLUTIONHOOD.8) Chinese PMs are used somewhat differentlyfrom their German equivalents, ExclamationMark for instance (Fig.2):460.0%5.0%10.0%15.0%20.0%25.0%30.0%35.0%Addition-SConjunc-MConcess-SElabo-SEvaluEvidence-SJoint-MJustify-NJustify-SNVresult-Prepa-SSolution-SSequence-MVCause-SRelation typeP(r|pm)ChineseGermanFigure 2: Rhetorical Function of ExclamationMark in Chinese and German corpora4 DiscussionHow useful are these six PMs in the prediction ofrhetorical relations in Chinese texts?
In ouropinion, this question can be answered partlythrough a comparison with Chinese cue phrases.Cue phrases are widely discussed andexploited in the literature of both Chinese studiesand RST applications as a major surface device.Unfortunately, Chinese cue phrases in naturaltexts are difficulty to identify automatically.
Asknown, Chinese words are made up of 1, 2, ormore characters, but there is no explicit worddelimiter between any pair of adjacent words in astring of characters.
Thus, they are not knownbefore tokenization (?fenci?
in Chinese, meaning?separating into words?, or ?word segmentation?so as to recognize meaningful words out ofpossible overlaps or combinations).
The taskmay sound simple, but has been the focus ofconsiderable research efforts (e.g.
Webster andKit, 1992; Guo 1997; Wu, 2003).Since many cue phrases are made up ofhigh-frequency characters (e.g.
??-ER?
in ??-er?
meaning ?but/so/and?, ?
?
?
-ran?er?meaning ?but/however?, ???-yin?er?
meaning?so/because of this?, ???-erqie?
meaing ?inaddition?
etc.
; ??-ci?
in ???-cihou?
meaning?later/hereafter?, ???
-yinci?
meaning ?as aresult?, ?????-youcikanlai?
meaning ?onthis ground/hence?, etc.
), a considerable amountof computation must be done before these cuephrases can ever been exploited.Apart from tokenization, POS and WSD areother necessary steps that should be taken beforemaking use of some common cue phrases.
Theyare all hard nuts in Chinese language engineering.Interestingly, many researches done in thesethree areas have made use of the informationcarried by PMs (e.g.
Sun et al 1998).Chan et al (2000) did a study on identifyChinese connectives as signals of rhetoricalrelations for their Chinese summarizer.
Theirtests were successful.
But like PMs, Chinese cuephrases are not in a one-to-one mappingrelationship with rhetorical relations, either.In our finished portion of CJPL corpus, we?veidentified 161 Types of cue phrases12 at or aboveour EUDA level, recording 539 tokens.
Thesecue phrases are scattered in 477 EDUAs,indicating 20.5% of the total relations in ourfinished portion of the corpus.
Our six PMs, onthe other hand, have 551 tokens in the samefinished portion, delimiting 345 EUDAs (and206 structural elements), and indicating 14.8% ofthe total relations.
However, since there are farmore types of cue phrases than types ofpunctuation marks, 90.1% of cue phrases aresparser at or above our EDUA level than theleast frequently used PM?Ellipsis in this case.And Chinese cue phrases don?t signal all therhetorical relations at all levels.
For instance,CONJUNTION is the most frequently usedrelation in our annotated text (taking 22.1% of allthe discursive relations), but it doesn?t havestrong correlation with any lexical item.
Its mostfrequent lexical cue is ?
?-ye?, taking 2.4%.ELABORATION is another common relation inCJPL, but it is rarely marked by cue phrases.ATTRIBUTION, SOLUTIONHOOD andDISJUNCTION are amongst other lowest markedrelations in Chinese?they happen to be signaledquite significantly by a punctuation mark.Given the cost to recognize Chinese cuephrases accurately, the sparseness of many ofthese cues, and the risk of missing all cue phrasesfor a particular discursive relation, punctuationmarks with strong rhetorical preferences appearto be useful supplements to cue phrases.5 ConclusionBecause rhetorical structure in Chinese texts isnot explicit by itself, systematic and quantitativeevaluation of various factors that can contributeto the automatic analysis of texts is quitenecessary.
The purpose of this study is to lookinto the discursive patterns of Chinese PMs, tosee if they can facilitate discourse parsingwithout deep semantic analysis.We have in this study observed the discursiveusage of six Chinese PMs, from their overalldistribution in our Chinese discourse corpus,their syntax in context, to their rhetorical roles at12 We are yet to give a theoretical definition of Cue Phrasesin our study.
But the identified ones range similarly to thoseEnglish cue phrases listed in Marcu (1997).47or above our EUDA level.
Current statistics seemto suggest clear patterns of their rhetorical roles,and their distinctive correlation with nuclearity inmost relations.
These patterns and correlationmay be useful in NLP projects.6 Future WorkWe are conscious of the size and granularity ofour treebank on which this analysis is based.
Weplan to get a larger team to work on the project,so as to make it more comparable to the Englishand German RST treebanks.Since the distinctive nucleus status of EUDAsended with these PMs may be useful in decidinggrowth point for RS-tree construction or for treepruning in summarization, we are also interestedin testing how well a baseline relation classifierperforms if it always predicts the most frequentrelations for these PMs.AcknowledgementSpecial thanks to Dr. Manfred Stede for licensingus to use the Potsdam Commentary Corpus.
