Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 836?842,Sofia, Bulgaria, August 4-9 2013. c?2013 Association for Computational LinguisticsExtracting Events with Informal Temporal References in PersonalHistories in Online CommunitiesMiaomiao Wen, Zeyu Zheng, Hyeju Jang, Guang Xiang, Carolyn Penstein Rose?Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University{mwen,zeyuz,hyejuj,guangx,cprose}@cs.cmu.eduAbstractWe present a system for extracting thedates of illness events (year and month ofthe event occurrence) from posting histo-ries in the context of an online medicalsupport community.
A temporal tagger re-trieves and normalizes dates mentioned in-formally in social media to actual monthand year referents.
Building on this, anevent date extraction system learns to in-tegrate the likelihood of candidate datesextracted from time-rich sentences withtemporal constraints extracted from event-related sentences.
Our integrated modelachieves 89.7% of the maximum perfor-mance given the performance of the tem-poral expression retrieval step.1 IntroductionIn this paper we present a challenging new eventdate extraction task.
Our technical contributionis a temporal tagger that outperforms previouslypublished baseline approaches in its ability toidentify informal temporal expressions (TE) andthat normalizes each of them to an actual monthand year (Chang and Manning, 2012; Strotgenand Gertz, 2010).
This temporal tagger then con-tributes towards high performance at matchingevent mentions with the month and year in whichthey occurred based on the complete posting his-tory of users.
It does so with high accuracy oninformal event mentions in social media by learn-ing to integrate the likelihood of multiple candi-date dates extracted from event mentions in time-rich sentences with temporal constraints extractedfrom event-related sentences.Despite considerable prior work in temporal in-formation extraction, to date state-of-the-art re-sources are designed for extracting temporallyscoped facts about public figures/organizationsfrom newswire or Wikipedia articles (Ji et al2011; McClosky and Manning, 2012; Garrido et[11/15/2008] I have noticed some pulling recently and Iwon't start rads until March.

Event keywords are in bold andtemporal expressions are in italics.al., 2012).
When people are instead communi-cating informally about their lives, they refer totime more informally and frequently from theirpersonal frame of reference rather than from animpersonal third person frame of reference.
Forexample, they may use their own birthday as atime reference.
The proportion of relative (e.g.,?last week?, ?two days from now?
), or personaltime references in our data is more than one and ahalf times as high as in newswire and Wikipedia.Therefore, it is not surprising that there would bedifficulty in applying a temporal tagger designedfor newswire to social media data (Strotgen andGertz, 2012; Kolomiyets et al 2011).
Recent be-havioral studies (Choudhury et al 2013; Park andChoi, 2012; Wen et al 2012) demonstrate thatuser-focused event mentions extracted from socialmedia data can provide a useful timeline-like toolfor studying how behavior patterns change overtime in response to mentioned events.
Our re-search contributes towards automating this work.2 TaskOur task is to extract personal illness events men-tioned in the posting histories of online commu-nity participants.
The input to our system is836a candidate event and a posting history.
Theoutput is the event date (month and year) forthe event if it occurred, or ?unknown?
if itdid not occur.
The process iterates through alist of 10 cancer events (CEs).
This list in-cludes breast cancer Diagnosis, Metastasis, Re-currence, Mastectomy, Lumpectomy, Reconstruc-tion, Chemotherapy-Start, Chemotherapy-End,Radiation-Start and Radiation-End.
For each ofthese target CEs, we manually designed an eventkeyword set that includes the name of the event,abbreviations, slang, aliases and related words.For each of the 10 events, all sentences thatmention a related event keyword are extractedfrom the user?s posting history.
Figure 1 showssevaral sentences that were extracted for one userfor the start date of Radiation.
The task is to de-termine that the beginning of this user?s Radiationtherapy was 2/2009.
Note that the user began topost about Radiation before she started it.
She firstreported planning to start Radiation in March, butthen rescheduled for February.
Most of the TEsare non-standard and need to be resolved to calen-dar dates (year and month).Once the full set of event mention sentences hasbeen extracted for a user, all the temporal expres-sions (TEs) that appear in the same sentence withan event mention are resolved to a set of candi-date dates.
Besides a standard event-time classi-fier for within-sentence event-time anchoring, weleverage a new source of temporal information totrain a constraint-based event-time classifier.
Pre-vious work only retrieves time-rich sentences thatinclude both the query and some TEs (Ji et al2011; McClosky and Manning, 2012; Garrido etal., 2012).
However, sentences that contain onlythe event mention but no explicit TE can also beinformative.
For example, the post time (usuallyreferred to as document creation time or DCT) ofthe sentence ?metastasis was found in my bone?might be labeled as being after the ?metastasis?event date.
These DCTs impose constraints onthe possible event dates, which can be integratedwith the event-time classifier, as a variant on re-lated work(Chambers, 2012).3 Related WorkPrevious work on TE extraction has focusedmainly on newswire text (Strotgen and Gertz,2010; Chang and Manning, 2012).
This paperpresents a rule-based TE extractor that identifiesand resolves a higher percentage of nonstandardTEs than earlier state-of-art temporal taggers.Our task is closest to the temporal slot fillingtrack in the TAC-KBP 2011 shared task (Ji et al2011) and timelining task (McClosky and Man-ning, 2012).
Their goal was to extract the tempo-ral bounds of event relations.
Our task has two keydifferences.
First, they used newswire, Wikipediaand blogs as data sources from which they extracttemporal bounds of facts found in Wikipedia in-foboxes.
Second, in the KBP task, the set of goldevent relations are provided as input, so that thetask is only to identify a date for an event that isguaranteed to have been mentioned.
In our task,we provide a set of potential events.
However,most of the candidate events won?t have ever beenreported within a user?s posting history.Temporal constraints have proven to be use-ful for producing a globally consistent timeline.In most temporal relation bound extraction sys-tems, the constraints are included as input ratherthan learned by the system (Talukdar et al 2012;Wang et al 2011).
A notable exception is Mc-Closkyet al(2012) who developed an approach tolearning constraints such as that people cannot at-tend school if they have not been born yet.
A no-table characteristic of our task is that constraintsare softer.
Diseases may occur in very differentways across patients.
Recurring illnesses falselyappear to have an unpredictable order.
Thus, therecan be no universal logical constraints on the orderof cancer events.Our approach to using temporal constraints is avariant on previously published approaches.
Gar-rido et al(2012) made use of DCT (document cre-ation time) as well, however, they have assumedthe DCT is within the time-range of the eventstated in the document, which is often not truein our data.
Chambers (2012) utilized the within-sentence time-DCT relation to learn constrains forpredicting DCT.
We learn the event-DCT relationsto produce constrains for the event date.4 Corpus AnnotationWe have scraped the posts, users, and profiles froma large online cancer support community.
Fromthis collection we extracted and then annotatedtwo separate corpora, one for evaluating our TEretrieval and normalization, the other one for eventdate extraction.For creating the TE extraction corpus, we ran-837domly picked one post from each of 1,000 ran-domly selected users.
We used this sampling tech-nique because each user tends to use a narrowrange of date expression forms.
From these posts,we manually extracted 601 TEs and resolved themto a specific month and year or just year if themonth was not mentioned.
Events not reportedto have occurred were annotated as ?unknown?.Our corpus for event date extraction consists ofthe complete posting history of 300 users that wererandomly drawn from our dataset.
Three annota-tors were provided with guidelines for how to in-fer the date of the events (Wen et al 2013).
Weachieved .94 Kappa on identification of whether anevent has a reported event date in a user?s historyor not.
In evaluation of agreement on extracteddates, we achieved a .99 Cronbach?s alpha.
Fromthis corpus, 509 events were annotated with occur-rence dates (year and month).
In our evaluation,we use data from 250 users for training, and 50 fortesting.5 MethodNow we explain on a more technical level how oursystem works on our task.
Given an event and auser?s post history, the system searches for all ofthe sentences that contain an event keyword (key-word sentence) and all the sentences that containboth a keyword and a TE (date sentence).
The TEsin the date sentences are resolved and then used ascandidate dates for the event.
For selecting amongcandidate dates, our model integrates two maincomponents.
First, the Date Classifier is trainedfrom date sentences to predict how likely its can-didate TE and the gold event date are to overlap.Then, because constraints over event dates can beinformed by temporal relations between the eventdate and the DCT, the Constraint-based Classifierprovides an indication of the plausibility of can-didate dates.
The integrated system combines thepredictions from both classifiers.5.1 Temporal TaggerWe design a rule-based temporal tagger that isbuilt using regular expression patterns to recog-nize informal TEs.
Similar to SUTime (Chang andManning, 2012), we identify and resolve a widerange of non-standard TE types such as ?Feb ?07(2/2007)?.
The additional types of TE we han-dle include: 1)user-specific TEs: A user?s age,cancer anniversary and survivorship can providetemporal information about the user?s CEs.
Weobtain the birth date of users from their personalprofile to resolve age date expressions such as ?atthe age of 57?.
2)non-whole numbers such as ?ayear and half?
and ?1/2 weeks?.
3)abbreviationsof time units : e.g.
?wk?
as the abbreviation of?week?.
4)underspecified month mentions, weresolve the year information according to the DCTmonth, the mentioned month and the verb tense.5.2 Date ClassifierWe train a MaxEnt classifier to predict the tem-poral relationship between the retrieved TE andthe event date as overlap or no-overlap, similarto the within-sentence event-time anchoring taskin TempEval-2 (UzZaman and Allen, 2010).
Fea-tures for the classifier include many of those in(McClosky and Manning, 2012; Yoshikawa et al2009): namely, event keyword and its dominantverb, verb and preposition that dominate TE, de-pendency path between TE and keyword and itslength, unigram and bigram word and POS fea-tures.
New features include the Event-Subject,Negative and Modality features.
In online sup-port groups, users not only tell stories about them-selves, they also share other patients?
stories (asshown in Figure 1).
So we add subject fea-tures to remove this kind of noise, which in-cludes the governing subject of the event key-word and its POS tag.
Modality features includethe appearance of modals before the event key-word (e.g., may, might).
Negative features includethe presence/absence of negative words (e.g., no,never).
These two features indicate a hypotheticalor counter-factual expression of the event.To calculate the likelihood of a candidate datefor an event, we need to aggregate the hard de-cisions from the classifier.
Let DSu be the setof the user?s date sentences, let Du be the set ofdates resolved from each TE.
We represent a Max-Ent classifier by Prelation(R|t, ds) for a candidatedate t in date sentence ds and possible relationR = {overlap, no-overlap}.
We map the distri-bution over relations to a distribution over datesby defining PDateSentence(t|DSu):PDateSentence(t|DSu) = (1)1Z(Du)?tj?Du?tj (t)Prelation(overlap|tj , dsj)?tj (t) ={1 if t = tj0 otherwise838We refer to this model as the Date Classifier.5.3 Constraint-based ClassifierPrevious work only retrieves time-rich sentences(i.e., date sentences) (Ling and Weld, 2010; Ji etal., 2011; McClosky and Manning, 2012; Garridoet al 2012).
However, keyword sentences can in-form temporal constraints for events and thereforeshould not be ignored.
For example, ?Well, I?mofficially a Radiation grad!?
indicates the user hasdone radiation by the time of the post (DCT).
?Ra-diation is not a choice for me.?
indicates the userprobably never had radiation.
The topic of thesentence can also indicate the temporal relation.For example, before chemotherapy, the users tendto talk about choices of drug combinations.
Afterchemotherapy, they talk about side-effects.This section departs from the above Date Clas-sifier and instead predicts whether each keywordsentence is posted before or overlap-or-after theuser?s event date.
The goal is to automaticallylearn time constraints for the event.
This task issimilar to the sentence event-DCT ordering taskin TempEval-2 (UzZaman and Allen, 2010).
Wecreate training examples by computing the tempo-ral relation between the DCT and the user?s goldevent date.
If the user has not reported an eventdate, the label should be unknown.We train a MaxEnt classifier on each eventmention paired with its corresponding DCT.
Allthe features used in the classifier component thatare not related to the TEs are included.
LetKSu be the set of the user?s keyword sentences,let Du be the set of dates resolved from eachdate sentence.
We define a MaxEnt classifier byPrelation(R|ks) for a keyword sentence ks andpossible relation R = {before, overlap-or-after,unknown}.
DCT is the post time of the keywordsentence ks.
The rel(DCT, t) function simply de-termines if the DCT is before or overlap-or-afterthe candidate date t. We map this distribution overrelations to a distribution over dates by definingPKeywordSentence(t,KSu):PKeywordSentence(t,KSu) = (2)1Z(Du)?ksj?KSuPrelation(rel(dctj , t)|ksj)rel(dct, t) ={before if dct < toverlap-or-after if dct ?
t5.4 Integrated ModelGiven the Date Classifier of Section 5.2 and theConstraint-based Classifier of Section 5.3, we cre-ate a Integrated Model combining the two with thefollowing linear interpolation as follows:P (t|postsu) = ?PDateSentence(t|DSu)+ (1?
?
)PKeywordSentence(t|KSu)where t is a candidate event date.
The system willoutput t that maximizes P (t|postsu) and unknownif DSu is empty.
?
was set to 0.7 by maximizingaccuracy using five-fold cross-validation over thetraining set.6 Evaluation Metric and Results6.1 Temporal Expression RetrievalWe compare our temporal tagger?s performancewith SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012) on the601 manually extracted TEs.
We exclude user-specific TEs such as birthday references since SU-Time cannot handle those.
We first evaluate iden-tification of the extent of a TE and then productionof the correctly resolved date for each recognizedexpression.
Table 1 shows that our tagger has sig-nificantly higher precision and recall for both.P R F1Extents SUTime 97.5 75.4 85.0Our tagger 97.9 91.8 94.8Normalization SUTime 89.4 71.2 79.3Our tagger 91.3 85.5 88.3Table 1: Temporal expression retrieval results6.2 Event-date Extraction6.2.1 Evaluation metricThe extracted date is only considered correct if itcompletely matches the gold date.
For less than4% of users, we have multiple dates for the sameevent (e.g., a user had a mastectomy twice).
Sim-ilar to the evaluation metric in a previous study(Jiet al 2011), in these cases, we give the system thebenefit of the doubt and the extracted date is con-sidered correct if it matches one of the gold dates.In previous work (McClosky and Manning, 2012;Ji et al 2011), the evaluation metric score is de-fined as 1/((1 + |d|)) where d is the differencebetween the values in years.
We choose a muchstricter evaluation metric because we need a pre-cise event date to study user behavior changes.6.2.2 Baselines and oracleBased on our temporal tagger, we provide twobaselines to describe heuristic methods of ag-gregating the hard decisions from the classifier839Baseline1 Baseline2 Date Integrated OracleCE count P R F1 P R F1 P R F1 P R F1 F1Diagnosis 112 .64 .70 .67 .60 .66 .63 .68 .75 .71 .68 .75 .71 .80Metastasis 7 .16 .58 .25 .12 .43 .19 .25 .86 .39 .25 .86 .39 .86Recurrence 14 .14 .35 .20 .11 .29 .16 .13 .36 .19 .13 .36 .19 .47Chemo-start 54 .49 .61 .54 .42 .52 .46 .52 .66 .58 .58 .74 .65 .76Chemo-end 43 .44 .59 .50 .36 .49 .42 .47 .63 .54 .48 .66 .56 .84Rad-start 38 .35 .47 .40 .30 .40 .34 .36 .47 .41 .40 .53 .46 .64Rad-end 35 .48 .63 .54 .30 .39 .34 .50 .66 .57 .50 .66 .57 .84Mastectomy 68 .58 .71 .64 .52 .62 .57 .62 .76 .68 .62 .76 .68 .77Lumpectomy 33 .49 .71 .58 .43 .76 .46 .46 .79 .58 .46 .79 .62 .91Reconstruction 43 .38 .57 .46 .29 .44 .35 .41 .63 .50 .43 .65 .52 .86Table 2: Event-level five-fold cross-validation performance of models and baselines on training data.learned in Section 5.3.
The first baseline, Base-line1, is to pick the date with the highest clas-sifier?s prediction confidence.
The second base-line, Baseline2, is along the same lines as theCombined Classifier used in (McClosky and Man-ning, 2012).
For example, if the candidatedate is ?6/2009?
and we have retrieved two TEsthat are resolved to ?6/2009?
and ?4/2008?, thenP (?6/2009?)
= Prelation(overlap|?6/2009?)
?Prelation(no-overlap|?4/2008?
).To set an upper bound on performance given ourTE retrieval system, we calculate the oracle scoreby considering an extraction as correct if the golddate is one of the retrieved candidate dates.
Theoracle score can differ from a perfect score sincewe can only use candidate temporal expressionsif (a)the relation is known and (b)mentions of theevent are retrievable, (c)the TE and event keywordappear in the same sentence, and (d)our temporaltagger is able to recognize and resolve it correctly.6.2.3 ResultsWe present the performance of our models, base-lines and the oracle in Table 2.
Both the Date Clas-sifier and Integrated model significantly outper-form the baselines (p < 0.0001, McNemar?s test,2-tailed).
This shows the value of our approach toleveraging redundancy of event date mentions.
In-corporating time constraints further improves theF1 of the Date Classifier by 3%.
The Integratedmodel achieves 89.7% of the oracle result.Model P R F1Baseline1 46.1 63.7 53.5Baseline2 39.3 54.4 45.6Date Classifier 49.6 67.7 57.3Integrated Model 51.0 69.3 58.8Oracle 77.3 77.3 77.3Table 3: Performance of systems on the test set.Table 3 shows the performance of our systemsand baselines on individual event types.
The JointModel derives most of its improvement from per-formance related to the Chemotherapy/Radiation-start date.
This is mainly because Chemotherapyand Radiation last for a period of time and thereare more event-related discussions containing theevent keyword.
None of our systems improves oncancer Metastasis and Recurrence.
This is likelydue to the sparsity of these events.7 ConclusionWe presented a novel event date extraction taskthat requires extraction and resolution of non-standard TEs, namely personal illness event dates,from the posting histories of online communityparticipants.
We constructed an evaluation corpusand designed a temporal tagger for non-standardTEs in social media.
Using a much stricter stan-dard correctness measure than in previous work,our method achieves promising results that are sig-nificantly better than two types of baseline.
Bycreating an analogous keyword set, our event dateextraction method could be easily adapted to otherdatasets.8 AcknowledgmentsWe want to thank Dong Nguyen and Yi-chiaWang, who helped provide the data for thisproject.
