Wehave incorporated text and sequence-based ap-proaches.1 IntroductionNatural Language Processing (NLP) has tackled andsolved a lot of prediction problems in Biology.
Onepractical research issue is Protein Sub-Cellular Lo-calization (PSL) Prediction.
Many previous ap-proaches have combined information from both textsand sequences by a machine learning (ML) technique(Shatkay et al, 2007).
All of them have not used tra-ditional NLP techniques such as parsing.
Our aimis to develop a novel PSL prediction system usinginformation from texts and sequences.
At the sametime, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the tra-ditional NLP and the sequence-based features in theviewpoint of the text-based approach.2 MethodologyA Maximum Entropy-based ML technique has beenused to combine information from both texts and se-quences.
To develop a supervised ML-based predic-tion system, an annotated corpus is needed to trainthe system.
However, there is no publicly availablecorpus that contains the PSL.
Therefore, we haveconstructed a corpus using GENIA corpus as an ini-tial data, because the annotation of Protein and Cel-lular component in GENIA corpus is already doneby human experts.
The new types of annotation con-tain two tasks.
The first annotation is to classify1,117 cellular components in GENIA corpus into 11locations, and the second annotation is to catego-rize a relation between a protein and a location intopositive, negative, and neutral.
Biologists selected11 locations based on Gene Ontology: Cytoplasm,Cytoskeleton, Endoplasmic reticulum, Extracellular,Golgi apparatus, Granule, Lysosome, Mitochondria,Nucleus, Peroxisome, and Plasma membrane.
Thenumber of co-occurrences in GENIA corpus is 864.1 Three human experts annotated with 79.49% ofinter-annotator agreement.
For calculating the inter-annotator agreement, all annotators annotated 1171The co-occurrence in the proposed approach is a sentencethat contains at least one pair of protein and cellular componentnames.90# Relevant Performance : F-score (Precision, Recall)Location relations Baseline Text Sequence Text + SequenceNucleus 173 0.282 (0.164, 1.0) 0.764 (0.736, 0.794) 0.725 (0.569, 1.000) 0.778 (0.758, 0.798)Cytoplasm 94 0.163 (0.089, 1.0) 0.828 (0.804, 0.852) 0.788 (0.657, 0.984) 0.828 (0.804, 0.852)Plasma membrane 23 0.043 (0.022, 1.0) 0.875 (0.814, 0.946) 0.857 (0.766, 0.973) 0.885 (0.841, 0.932)Table 1: Performance of protein sub-cellular localization prediction for each location.co-occurrences.
From the texts, we used eight fea-tures: (1) protein and cellular component names an-notated by human experts, (2) adjacent one and twowords of names, (3) bag of words, (4) order of names,(5) distance between names, (6) syntactic categoryof names, (7) predicates of names, and (8) part-of-speech of predicates.
To analyze the syntactic struc-ture, we used the ENJU full parser whose output ispredicate-argument structures of a sentence.To combine the information from sequences, weattempted to predict PSL for all proteins in GE-NIA corpus by two existing sequence-based meth-ods: WoLF PSORT (Horton et al, 2006) and SOSUI(Hirokawa et al, 1998).
Approximately 14% of pro-tein names in GENIA corpus obtained results.
Fromthe sequences, we used two features: (1) existenceof the sequence-based results, and (2) the number ofsequence-based results.3 Experimental results and ConclusionThe proposed approach has integrated text andsequence-based approaches.
To evaluate the system,we performed 10-fold cross validation using 864 co-occurrences including positive, negative, and neutralrelations.
We measured the precision, recall, andF-score of the system for all experiments.
Among864 co-occurrences in GENIA corpus, 301 positiveor negative co-occurrences have been considered asrelevant relations, and the remaining 563 neutral re-lations have been considered as irrelevant relations.Four approaches have been compared based onthree locations in Table 1.
The four approaches arebaseline, text-based approach, sequence-based ap-proach, and integration of the text and sequence-based approaches.
Baseline experiment used an as-sumption: there is a relevant relation if a protein anda cellular component names occur together in a co-occurrence.
The three locations selected when thereare the sequence-based results and the number of rel-evant relations is more than one.
All experimentsshowed that the integration of text and sequence-based approaches is the best, even though the exper-iments for Cytoplasm showed the best performanceat both the text-based approach and the integrationapproach.A new prediction method has been developed forprotein sub-cellular localization, and it has integratedtext and sequence-based approach using an ML tech-nique.
The traditional NLP techniques contributedto improve performance of the text-based approach,and the text and sequence-based approaches recipro-cally contributed to obtain a improved PSL predic-tion method.
The newly constructed corpus will beincluded in the next version of GENIA corpus.
Thereare weak points in the proposed approach.
The cur-rent evaluation method has been focusing on eval-uating the text-based approach, and the results ofthe sequence-based approach were obtained for only14% of proteins in GENIA corpus, so these situationsmight be the reason that the sequence-based approachdid contribute a little.
Thus, we need to evaluate theproposed approach with a more reasonable method.AcknowledgmentsWe acknowledge Fusano Todokoro for her technicalassistance.ReferencesPaul Horton, Keun-Joon Park, Takeshi Obayashi andKenta Nakai.
