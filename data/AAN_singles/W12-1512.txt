INLG 2012 Proceedings of the 7th International Natural Language Generation Conference, pages 76?84,Utica, May 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsOn generating coherent multilingual descriptions of museum objectsfrom Semantic Web ontologiesDana Dann?llsSpr?kbankenDepartment of SwedishUniversity of Gothenburg, Swedendana.dannells@svenska.gu.seAbstractDuring the last decade, there has beena shift from developing natural lan-guage generation systems to developinggeneric systems that are capable of pro-ducing natural language descriptions di-rectly from Web ontologies.
To makethese descriptions coherent and accessi-ble in different languages, a methodol-ogy is needed for identifying the gen-eral principles that would determine thedistribution of referential forms.
Pre-vious work has proved through cross-linguistic investigations that strategies forbuilding coreference are language depen-dent.
However, to our knowledge, there isno language generation methodology thatmakes a distinction between languagesabout the generation of referential chains.To determine the principles governingreferential chains, we gathered data fromthree languages: English, Swedish andHebrew, and studied how coreference isexpressed in a discourse.
As a result ofthe study, a set of language specific coref-erence strategies were identified.
Usingthese strategies, an ontology-based mul-tilingual grammar for generating writ-ten natural language descriptions aboutpaintings was implemented in the Gram-matical Framework.
A preliminary eval-uation of our method shows language-dependent coreference strategies lead tobetter generation results.createdBy (Guernica, PabloPicasso)currentLocation (Guernica, MuseoReinaSof?a)hasColor (Guernica, White)hasColor (Guernica, Gray)hasColor (Guernica, Black)Guernica is created by Pablo Picasso.Guernica has as current location the MuseoReina Sof?a.

These systems employ controlledlanguage mechanisms and Natural LanguageGeneration (NLG) technologies such as dis-course structures and simple aggregation meth-ods to verbalise Web ontology statements, asexemplified in figure 1.If we want to adapt such systems to the gen-eration of coherent multilingual object descrip-tions, at least three language dependent prob-lems must be faced, viz.
lexicalisation, aggre-gation and generation of referring expressions.The ontology itself may contain the lexical in-76Guernica is created by Pablo Picasso.It has as current location the Museo Reina Sof?a.It has as color White, Gray and Black.Guernica m?lades av Pablo Picasso.Den finns p?

Hall-iday and Hasan (1976), and other well knowntheories such as Centering Theory (Grosz etal., 1995), propose establishing a coherent de-scription by replacing the entity referring to theMain Subject Reference (MSR) with a pronoun?
a replacement which might result in sim-ple descriptions such as illustrated in figure 2.Although these descriptions are coherent, i.e.they have a connectedness that contributes tothe reader?s understanding of the text, they areconsidered non-idiomatic and undeveloped bymany readers because of consecutive pronouns?
a usage which in this particular context is un-acceptable.Since previous theories do not specify thetypes of linguistic expressions different enti-ties may bear in different languages or do-mains, there remain many open questions thatneed to be addressed.
The question addressedhere is the choice of referential forms to re-place a sequence of pronouns, which makesthe discourse coherent in different languages.Our claim is that different languages use dif-ferent linguistic expressions when referring toa discourse entity depending on the seman-tic context.
Hence a natural language gen-erator must employ language dependent co-referential strategies to produce coherent de-scriptions.
This claim is based on cross-linguistic investigations into how coreferenceis expressed, depending on the target languageand the domain (Giv?n, 1983; Hein, 1989; Ariel,1990; Prince, 1992; Vallduv?
and Engdahl, 1996).In this paper we present a contrasting studyconducted in English, Swedish and Hebrew tolearn how coreference is expressed.
The studywas carried out in the domain of art, morespecifically focusing on naturally-occurringmuseum object descriptions.
As a result of thestudy, strategies for generating coreference inthree languages are suggested.
We show howthese strategies are captured in a grammar de-veloped in the Grammatical Framework (GF).1We evaluated our method by experimentingwith lexicalised semantic web ontology state-ments which were structured according to par-ticular organizing principles.
The result of theevaluation shows language-dependent corefer-ence strategies lead to better generation results.2 Related workAlso Prasad (2003) employed a corpus-basedmethodology to study the usage of referring ex-pressions.
Based on the results of the analy-sis, he developed an algorithm to generate ref-erential chains in Hindi.
Other algorithms forcharacterizing referential expressions based oncorpus studies have been proposed and imple-mented in Japanese (Walker et al, 1996), Ital-ian (Di Eugenio, 1998), Catalan and Spanish(Potau, 2008), and Romanian (Harabagiu andMaiorano, 2000).Although there has been computationalwork related to Centering for generating a co-herent text (Kibble and Power, 2000; Barzilayand Lee, 2004; Karamanis et al, 2009), we arenot aware of any methodology or NLG systemthat employs ontologies to guide the generationof referential chains depending on the languageconsidered.3 Data collection, annotations andanalysis3.1 MaterialTo study the domain-specific conventions andthe ways of signalling linguistic content in En-1http://www.grammaticalframework.org/77glish, Swedish and Hebrew, we collected ob-ject descriptions written by native speakers ofeach language from digital libraries that areavailable through on-line museum databases.The majority of the Swedish descriptions weretaken from the World Culture Museum.2 Themajority of the English descriptions were col-lected from the Metropolitan Museum.3 Themajority of the Hebrew descriptions were takenfrom Artchive.4 Table 1 gives an overview ofthe three text collections.

Sucha fine-grained semantic definition is availablein the ontology of paintings (Dann?lls, 2011),9which was developed in the Web OntologyLanguage (OWL) to allow expressing usefuldescriptions of paintings.10 The ontology con-tains specific concepts of painting types, exam-ples of the hierarchy of concepts that are speci-fied in the ontology are listed below.subClassOf(Artwork, E22_Man-Made_Object)subClassOf(Painting, Artwork)subClassOf(PortraitPainting, Painting anddepicts(Painting, AnimateThing))subClassOf(OilPainting, Painting andhasMaterial(Painting, OilPaint))When analysing the corpus-data, we lookcloser at two linguistic forms of reference ex-pressions: definite noun phrases and pronouns,focusing on three semantic relations: direct hy-pernym (for example Painting is direct hyper-nym of Portrait Painting), higher hypernym (forexample, both Artwork and Man-Made Objectare higher hypernyms of Portrait Painting) and7http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/8In the Hebrew examples we use a Latin transliterationinstead of the Hebrew alphabet.9http://spraakdata.gu.se/svedd/painting-ontology/painting.owl10http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/78Eng: (1) [[The Starry Night]Man?Made_Object]i is [[ a painting]Man?Made_Object]i by [[DutchPost-Impressionist artist]Actor_Appellation]j [[Vincent van Gogh]Actor]j .

two different linguistic units ofreference expressions belonging to the sameconcept.3.5 Data analysis and resultsThe analysis consisted of two phases: (1) anal-yse the texts for discourse patterns, and (2)analyse the texts for patterns of coreference inthe discourse.Discourse patterns A discourse pattern (DP)is an approach to text structuring throughwhich particular organizing principles of thetexts are defined through linguistic analysis.The approach follows McKeown (1985) to for-malize principles of discourse for use in a com-putational process.
Following this approach,we have identified three discourse patterns fordescribing paintings that are common in thethree languages.
These are summarised below.?
DP1 Man-Made_Object, Object-Type, Ac-tor, Time-span, Place, Dimension?
DP2 Man-Made_Object, Time-span,Object-Type, Actor, Dimension, Place?
DP3 Man-Made_Object, Actor, Time-span,Dimension, PlacePatterns of coreference In the analysis forcoreference, we only considered entities ap-pearing in subject positions.
Below follows ex-amples of the most common types of corefer-ence found in the corpus-data.As seen in (1b) and in many other exam-ples, the first reference expressions are the def-inite noun phrase the painting, i.e.
coreferenceis build through the direct hypernym relation.The choice of the reference expression in the fol-lowing sentence (1c) is the definite noun phrasethe work, which is a higher hypernym of themain subject of reference The Old Musician.
(1) a.
The Old Musician is an 1862 paintingby French painter, ?douard Manet.b.
The painting shows the influence ofthe work of Gustave Courbet.c.
This work is one of Manet?s largestpaintings and ?
is now conserved atthe National Gallery of Art inWashington.Sentence (2b) shows a noun is avoided; thelinguistic unit of the reference expression is apronoun preceding a conjunction, followed byan ellipsis.
(2) a.
The Birth of Venus is a painting bythe French artist Alexandre Cabanel.b.
It was painted in 1863, and ?
is nowin the Mus?e d?Orsay in Paris.In the Swedish texts we also find occurrencesof pronouns in the second sentence of the dis-course, as in (3b).
We learn that the most com-mon linguistic units of the reference expres-sions also are definite noun phrases given bythe direct hypernym relation.79(3) a. Stj?rnenatten ?r en m?lning av dennederl?ndske postimpressionistiskekonstn?ren Vincent van Gogh fr?n1889.b.

(b) Since 1941 it was in thepermanent exhibition of the museum inNew York.
(c) The picture is widelyhailed as his magnum opus and has beenreproduced many times.
)Similar to English, the most common linguis-tic units of the reference expressions are definitenoun phrases, as in (4b).
However, the relationof these phrases with respect to the main sub-ject of reference is either a direct hypernym or asynonym, such as tavlan in (3c) and (5b).

(b) The picture can be seen in Betel at thepeople?s high school premises.
)The Hebrew examples also include definitenoun phrases determined by the direct hyper-nym relation, as hastiyor in (6b).
Pronouns onlyoccur in a context that contains a comparison,for example (6c).
In other cases, e.g.
(7b), (7c),the relation selected for the reference expres-sion is higher-hypernym.

Table 3 summarizes the results theanalysis revealed.
1st, 2nd and 3rd correspondto the first, second and third reference expres-sion in the discourse.
In summary, we found:?
Pronoun is common in Swedish and En-glish, and rare in Hebrew?
Direct-hypernym is common in English,Swedish and Hebrew?
Higher-hypernym is rare in English andSwedish, and common in Hebrew?
Synonym is common in Swedish, less fre-quent in English, and rare in HebrewDP English Swedish Hebrew1st 2nd 3rd 1st 2nd 3rd 1st 2nd 3rd1 DH P DH P DH ?1 DH HH ?

).Although the identified strategies are con-strained by a relatively simple syntax anda domain ontology, they show clear differ-ences between the languages.
As table 3shows, consecutive pronouns occur commonlyin English, while consecutive higher hypernymnoun phrases are common in Hebrew.4 Generating referential chains fromWeb ontology4.1 Experimental dataWe made use of the data available in the paint-ing ontology presented in section 3.4 to gener-ate multilingual descriptions by following thedomain discourse patterns.
The data consists ofaround 1000 ontology statements and over 250lexicalised entities extracted from the SwedishNational Museums of World Culture and theGothenburg City Museum.4.2 The generation grammarThe grammar was implemented in GF, a gram-mar formalism oriented toward multilingualgrammar development and generation (Ranta,2004).
It is a logical framework based on a gen-eral treatment of syntax, rules, and proofs bymeans of a typed ?-calculus with dependenttypes (Ranta, 1994).
Similar to other logicalformalisms, GF separates between abstract andconcrete syntaxes.
The abstract syntax reflectsthe type theoretical part of a grammar.
The con-crete syntax is formulated as a set of lineariza-tion rules that can be superimposed on an ab-stract syntax to generate words, phrases, sen-tences, and texts of a desirable language.
In ad-dition, GF has an associated grammar library(Ranta, 2009); a set of parallel natural languagegrammars that can be used as a resource forvarious language processing tasks.Our grammar consists of one abstract mod-ule that reflects the domain knowledge and iscommon to all languages, plus three concretemodules, one for each language, which en-code the language dependent strategies.
Ratherthan giving details of the grammatical formal-ism, we will show how GF captures the con-straints presented in section 3.6.
The examplesinclude the following GF constructors: mkText(Text), mkPhr (Phrase), mkS (Sentence), mkCl(Clause), mkNP (Noun Phrase), mkVP (VerbPhrase), mkAdv (Verb Phrase modifying ad-verb), passiveVP (Passive Verb Phrase), mkN(Noun).81Englishpainting paintingtype painteryear museum = letstr1 : Phr = mkPhr(mkS (mkCl (mkNP painting) (mkVP(mkVP (mkNP(mkNP a_Art paintingtype) make_V2))(mkAdv by8agent_Prep(mkNP (mkNP painter)(mkAdv in_Prep year.s))))));str2 : Phr = mkPhr (mkS(mkCl (mkNP the_Art paintingtype)(mkVP (passiveVP display_V2)(mkAdv at_Prep museum.s))))in mkText str1 (mkText str2) ;Swedishpainting paintingtype painteryear museum = letstr1 : Phr = mkPhr(mkS (mkCl (mkNP painting)(mkVP (mkVP(mkNP a_Art paintingtype))(mkAdv by8agent_Prep(mkNP (mkNP painter)(mkAdv from_Prep (mkNP year)))))));str2 : Phr = mkPhr(mkS (mkCl (mkNP the_Art(mkN "tavla" "tavla"))(mkVP (mkVP (depV finna_V))(mkAdv on_Prep (mkNP museum)))) )in mkText str1 (mkText str2) ;Hebrewpainting paintingtype painteryear museum = letstr1 : Str = ({s = painting.s ++paintingtype.s ++ "sl " ++painter.s ++ "msnt " ++ year.s}).s;str2 : Str = ({s = artwork_N.s ++(displayed_V !
Fem) ++ at_Prep.s ++museum.s}).s inss (str1 ++ " ."
++ str2 ++ " ."
);The above extracts from the concrete mod-ules follow the observed organization prin-ciples concerning the order of semantic in-formation in a discourse and the generationof language-dependent referential chains (pre-sented in the right-hand column of table 4).
Inthese extracts, variations in referential formsare captured in the noun phrase of str2.
In theEnglish module, the paintingtype that is the di-rect hypernym of the painting object is coded,while in the Swedish module, a synonym wordof the painting concept is coded, e.g tavla.
Inthe Hebrew module, a higher concept in the hi-erarchy of paintings, artwork_N.s is coded.4.3 Experiments and resultsA preliminary evaluation was conducted to testhow significant is the approach of adaptinglanguage-dependent coreference strategies toproduce coherent descriptions.
Nine humansubjects participated in the evaluation, threenative speakers of each language.The subjects were given forty object descrip-tion pairs.
One description containing onlypronouns as the type of referring expressionsand one description that was automaticallygenerated by applying the language dependentcoreference strategies.
Examples of the descrip-tion pairs the subjects were asked to evaluateare given in table 4.
We asked the subjects tochoose the description they find most coherentbased on their intuitive judgements.
Partici-pant agreement was measured using the kappastatistic (Fleiss, 1971).
The results of the evalu-ation are reported in table 5.Pronouns Pronouns/NPs KEnglish 17 18 0.66Swedish 9 29 0.78Hebrew 6 28 0.72Table 5: A summary of the human evaluation.On average, the evaluators approved at leasthalf of the automatically generated descrip-tions, with a considerably good agreement.
Acloser look at the examples where chains of pro-nouns were preferred revealed that these oc-curred in English when a description consistedof two or three sentences and the second andthird sentences specified the painting dimen-sions or a date.
In Swedish, these were pre-ferred whenever a description consisted of twosentences.
In Hebrew, the evaluators preferreda description containing a pronoun over a de-scription containing the higher hypernym Man-made object, and also preferred the pronounwhen a description consisted of two sentences,82EnglishThe Long Winter is an oil-painting The Long Winter is an oil-paintingby Peter Kandre from 1909.

As a result of the in-vestigation, a set of language-specific coref-erence strategies were identified and imple-mented in GF.
This multilingual grammar wasused to generate object descriptions whichwere then evaluated by native speakers of eachlanguage.
The evaluation results, although per-formed with a small number of descriptionsand human evaluators, indicate that language-dependent coreference strategies lead to betteroutput.
Although the data used to comparethe co-referential chains was restricted in size, itwas sufficient to determine several differencesbetween the languages for the given domain.Future work aims to extend the grammar tocover more ontology statements and discoursepatterns.
We will consider conjunctions and el-lipsis in these patterns.
We intend to formalizeand generalize the strategies presented in thispaper and test whether there exist universal co-referential chains, which might result in coher-ent descriptions in more than three languages.AcknowledgmentsThe research presented in this paper was sup-ported in part by MOLTO European UnionSeventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-832013) under grant agreement FP7-ICT-247914.11I would like to thank the Centre for Lan-guage Technology (CLT) in Gothenburg and theanonymous INLG reviewers.12ReferencesMira Ariel.
