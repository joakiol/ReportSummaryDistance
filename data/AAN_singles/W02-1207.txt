IntroductionAs electronic communications are nowincreasing, the term Natural Language Processingshould be considered in the broader aspect ofMulti- Language Processing system.
An importantphase in the system development process isrequirement engineering, which can define as theprocess of analyzing the problems in a certainlanguage.
An essential part of the requirement-engineering phase is computational languagemodeling which is an abstract representation ofthe behavior of the language.
In order to have agood language model for creating cost-effectivesolutions to the practical problems, the languageresources are necessary for the language behavioranalysis.This paper intended to express what wehave and what we have done by the desire tomake a bridge between the languages and toshare and make maximal use of the existinglexica, corpus and the tools.
Three main topicsare, then, focussed:?

In section 4, then, providesThai Language Computational Modeling as abasis for creating cost-effective solutions to thosepractical problems.2.
A State of the Art of Thai LanguageResourceThis section gives a survey of a state of theart of Thai Language Resources consisting ofCorpus, Lexicon and Tools.
Here, we will presentonly the resources that open for public access.2.1 CorpusThe existing Thai corpus is divided into 2types; speech and text corpus developed by manyThai Universities.
Thai Language Audio ResourceCenter of Thammasart University (ThaiARC)(http:// thaiarc.ac.th) developed speech corpusaimed to provide digitized audio information fordissemination via Internet.
The project pioneersthe production and collection of various types ofaudio information and various styles of Thaispeech, such as royal speeches, academic lectures,oral literature, etc.For Text corpus, originally, the goal of thecorpus collecting is used only inside thelaboratory.
Until 1996, National Electronics andComputer Technology Center (NECTEC) andCommunications Research Laboratory (CRL) hada collaboration project with the purpose ofpreparing Thai language corpus from technicalproceedings for language study and applicationresearch.
It named ORCHID corpus (NECTEC,1997).
NAiST Corpus began in 1996 with theprimary aim of collecting document frommagazines for training and testing program inWritten Production Assistance (Asanee, 1995).The existing corpus can be summarized as shownin Table 1.Table 1: The List of Thai CorpusList Corpus Type Amount StatusNECTEC OrchidCorpusPOS-Tagged Text2,560,000wordsOnlineKasetsartUniv.NAiSTCorpus Text60,511,974words OnlineThammasartUniv.ThaiARCDigitizedaudio4000words++ online2.2 LexiconThere are a number of Thai lexicons, whichhas been developed as shown in Table 2.Table 2: The List of Thai DictionariesDictionary Type Size(word)status Web siteRoyalInstituteDictionaryMono 33,582 Online http://rirs3.royin.go.th/riThdict/lookup.htmlLexitron Bi 50,000 Online http://www.links.nectec.or.th/lexit/lex_t.htmlNaiSTLexibaseMono 15,000 Online http://beethoven.cpe.ku.ac.th/SoSethaputraDictionaryBi - 48,000Engwords- 38,000ThaiwordsOnline http://www.thaisoftware.co.th/Dictionary Type Size(word)status Web siteNarin?sThailandhomepageBi - Online http://www.wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de/~sascha/thailand/dictionary/dictionary_index.htmlSaikamonlineBi 133,524 Online http://saikam.nii.ac.jp/.Lao-Thai-English Dic.Multi 5,000 Offline -From the table 2, Only Lexitron (fromNECTEC) and NAiST Lexibase (from KasetsartUniversity) that were applied to NLP.
NAiSTLexibase has been developed based on relationalmodel for managing and maintaining easily in thefuture.
It contains 15,000 words list with theirsyntax and the semantic concept information inthe concept code.2.3 Corpus and Language AnalysisToolsCorpus is not only the resource of LinguisticKnowledge but is used for training, improving andevaluating the NLP systems.
The tools for corpusmanipulation and knowledge acquisition becomenecessary.NAiST Lab.
has developed the toolkit forsharing via the Internet.
It has been designed forcorpus collecting, annotating, maintaining andanalyzing.
Additionally, it has been designed asthe engine, which the end user could use with theirdata.
(See a service on http://naist.cpe.ku.ac.th).3.
Thai Language Behavior AnalysisIn order to have a good language model forcreating cost-effective solutions to the practicalproblems in application development, languagebehavior must be observed.
Next is Thai languagebehavior analysis based on NAiST corpusconsisting of Lexicon growth, Thai wordformation and Phrase construction.3.1 Lexicon GrowthThe lexicon growth is studied by using Wordlist Extraction tool to extract word lists from alarge-scale corpus and mapping to the RoyalInstitute Dictionary (RID).
It is noticeable thatthere are two types of lexicon: common andunknown words.
The common word lists are somewords in RID, which occur in almost everydocument, and use in daily life.
They are primitivec3c4c5c1c2c3c4c5c1c2c4c5c1c2c3words but not being proper names or colloquialwords.
The unknown or new words occur much inthe real document such as Proper names,Colloquial words, Abbreviations, and Foreignwords.The lexicon growth is observed from corpussize, 400,000, 2,154,700 and 60,511,974 wordsfrom Newspaper, Magazine and Agriculture text.We found that common word lists increased from111,954 to 839,522 and 49,136,408 wordsaccording to the corpus size, while the unknownword lists increased from 288,046 to 1,315,178and 11,375,566 words respectively as shown intable3.Table 3 : Lexicon-growthSize of Corpus/ words Common words Unknownwords400,000 111,954 288,0462,154,700 839,522 1,315,17860,511,974 49,136,408 11,375,566Regarding to 60,511,974 words corpus in thetable 3, it composes of 35,127,012 words fromNewspaper, 18,359,724 words from Magazine and7,025,238 words from Agricultural Text.Unknown words occur in each category as shownin table 4.Table 4: The Categories of Unknown wordsaccording to the various corpus genresTypes ofunknown wordNewspaper(words)Magazine(words)AgriculturalText (words)Proper name 4,809,160 1,272,747 1,170,076Spoken words 58,335 8,787 0Abbreviation 70,109 43,056 0Foreign words 304,519 239,107 3,399,670Total 5,242,123 1,563,697 4,569,746According to table 3 and 4, we could observe thatnot only unknown words increase but commonwords also increase and the main categories ofincreasing unknown word are proper names andforeign words.
Consequently, a computationalmodel of unknown word extraction and nameentity identification has been developed and alsoof new word construction.3.2 New Word Formation and CoreNounRegarding to the growth of common wordshown in table 3, we studied how the new wordscome from.3.2.1 Basic Information about ThaiThai words are multi-syllabic words whichstringing together could form a new word.
SinceThai has no inflection and no word delimiters,Thai morphological processing is mainly torecognize word boundaries instead of recognizinga lexical form from a surface form as in English.Let  C  be a sequence of charactersC  = c1c2c3?cn : n>=1Let  W  be a sequence of wordsW = w1w2w3?wm : m>=1Where wi = c1ic2i?ci r: i>=1, r>=2Since Thai sentences are formed with asequence of words with a stream of characters,i.e., c1c2c3?cn mostly without explicitdelimiters, the word boundary in ?c1c2c3c4c5?pattern as shown below could have twoambiguous forms.
One is ?c1c2?
and  ?c3c4c5?.The other one is  ?c1c2c3?
and  ?c4c5?
(Kawtrakul, 1997)Stream of charactersFigure 1: Word Boundary AmbiguityF gure 1, i acters  groupeddiffer meaning ords w hangedtoo.
For example, ?????
n be gr  to ????-??
(fold one's arms across the chest)?clump of flower)?.
From our corpthat the sentence with 45 characombinations of words sequence.3.2.2 New word constructionAlmost all-Thai new words armeans of compounding and nomiusing a set of prefixes.3.2.2.1 NominalizationNominalization is a process bycan be formed as a noun by using pNoun words formed by using prefixand ?????

Words formed by using pref????(t?ha:w)?
and ????

(phu:)?s which signal)?
are used inverb or verbphrase and sometimes from noun(Nominalization).
???
(ka:n) that co-occur withnoun, represents the meaning about duty orfunction of noun it relates to.
???
(ka:n) that co-occur with verbs, always occur with action verbs.????
(khwa:m) always co-occur with state verbs.Prefix ?
???
(phu:) ?
?
???(nak)?
and ????
(t?ha:w)?are used in the process of new word formation.
???
(phu:)  and ???
(nak) co-occur with verb phrase.
???
(nak) sometimes can occur with a few fields ofnouns, such as sport and music.
So at the first timewe kept words, which constructed from prefix ????(nak)?
plus noun in the lexicon for solving theproblem.
Prefix ????(t?ha:w)?
can co-occur withnoun only.3.2.2.2 CompoundingThai new words can, also, be combined toform compound nouns and are invented almostdaily.
They normally have at least two parts.
Thefirst part represents a pointed object or personsuch as ??
(man), ????
(pot), ???
(tail), ???(plant).
Thesecond part identifies what kind of object orperson it is, or what its purpose is like ?????
(drive acar), ???????
(cook rice), ????
(tiger), ???
?(water).
Table 5shows the examples of compound noun in Thai.Table 5: The Examples of Thai Compound NounWhat or who What type / what purpose??
(man) ?????
(drive a car),????
(pot) ???????
(cook rice)???
(tail) ????(tiger)???

(play)Driving LicenseLiving RoomFrom Table 6, it has shown that somecompound nouns maintain some parts of thoseprimitive word meaning but some changed to anew meaning.
In this paper, we are only interestedin compound noun grouping from primitive wordswhich were changed the meaning to more abstractbut still maintain some parts of those primitiveword meanings, e.g.
?????
(driver) ??????(cooker)etc.?
The word ????
maintains its meaning whichhas a concept of human, but when it wascompounded with ???(car)?
and ?????
(kitchen)?,their meanings have changed to the occupation bythe word relation in the equivalent level.
In case ofcompound noun that change a whole meaningsuch as ????????
(a boy scout)?, it will be kept in thelexicon.3.2.2.3 Compound noun extraction problemsThere are three non-trivial problems?
Compound Noun VS Sentence Distinction?
Compound Noun Boundary Ambiguity?
Core noun DetectionCompound Noun VS SentenceSeveral NP structures have the same pattern assentences.
Since Thai language is flexible and hasno word derivation, including to preposition incompound noun can be omitted, etc.
This causes acompound noun having the same pattern assentence.
Thus, Thai NP analysis in IR system ismore difficult than English.
(See Figure 2)Figure 2: The comparison of noun phrase andsentence structureIn figure 2, compound noun ?????????????
(adining table) actually omit the preposition ???
?????
(for)?, which is a relation that point to the purposeof the first noun ?????
(table)?.The Compound Noun Boundary AmbiguityAfter we have extracted noun phrase aimingfor enhancing the IR system, we have to segmentSentence: ??????????
(birds eat fruit)In Thai: ??
???
????
?Birds eat fruitSyntactic cn          tv cnCategoryCompound Noun: ???????????
(a dining table)In Thai: ????(??
?????)
???
???
?table  eat riceSyntactic cn  tv cnCategorythat noun phrase into sub noun phrase orcompound noun in order to specify the core nounas index and its modifier as sub-index.
Forexample, compound noun with ?noun + noun +verb?
structure: ????(child/N)??(hair/N)???
(long/V)etc.
In this case, the second noun and verb have tobe grouped firstly since it behaves similarly to amodifier by omitting the relative pronoun thatrepresents its purpose, i.e., ?who has?.Another case of Compound Noun BoundaryAmbiguity is word combination.
Consider thesequence of words as the example of NP thatcomposes of four words as follows:NP = N1N2N3N4There are 8 word combinations of compoundnoun as shown in figure 3.In figure 3, word string has to be groupedcorrectly for the correct meaning.The ambiguity of noun phrase boundary hasalso directly effected the efficiency of textretrieval.Core Noun detectionDue to the Information Retrieval, a head orcore of noun phrase detection is necessary.
In thispaper, core noun refers to the most important andspecific word that the information retrieval andextraction can directly retrieve or extract withoutover generating candidate words.
However, bythe observation, the core of noun phrase needs notto be the initial words.
Some of them are at thefinal position and some have word relation in theequivalent level (As shown in Table 7).Table 7: The examples of core noun in NPNoun phrase(NP) Core nounW1              W2?????????

+ ??
?fruit     papaya    greenbe W1 located at the initial positionbe W2 located at the final positionbe W2 located at the secondpositionAs mentioned above, the models of New WordGeneration and Noun Phrase Recognition becomeone of the interesting works in Thai processing.3.3 Phrase and Sentence ConstructionNext, we will indicate the main problems thatinfluence to MT, IE and IR system.
These areconstituent movement, zero anaphora and iterativerelative clause.3.3.1 Constituent MovementConstituent is the relationship between lexiconunits, which are parts of a larger unit.Constituency is usually shown by a tree diagramor by square brackets:Ex.
[[???????????????????]
[????????????
]][[meeting committee] [very smoothly]].Constituent acts as a chunk that can be movedtogether and it often occurs in Thai language (seeFig.
4).
The constituents can be moved to thefront, the middle or the end of the sentence.S =Figure 4 The movements of constituentEx.
:      ???????

?The fisherman goes to catch the fish in the morning.????????

???????
????
?The fisherman goes to in the morning, catch the fish???????
?????
????????
??????
?In the morning, catch the fish, the fisherman goes to.Noun, adverb, and prepositional phrase areoften move while verb phrases are.3.3.2 Zero AnaphoraTo make the cohesion in the discourse, theanaphora is used as a reference to ?point back?
tosome entities called referent or antecedent, givenin the preceding discourse.
Halliday, M.A.K.
andHasan, Rugaiya (1976) divided cohesion inEnglish into 5 categories as shown in Table 8:Table 8: Categories of anaphoraReference - Personal Reference, DemonstrativeReference, Comparative ReferenceSubstitution - Nominal Substitution, Verbal Substitution,Causal SubstitutionEllipsis - Nominal Ellipsis, Verbal Ellipsis, CausalEllipsisConjunction - Additive, Adversative, Casual, TemporalLexical Cohesion - Reiteration(Repetition, Synonym or NearSynonym, Super ordinate, General word)- CollocationFigure 3: Patterns of noun phrase analysisC1 C2 C3 C4Observing from the corpus in: news, magazineand agricultural text, there are 4 types ofanaphora.
Ellipsis or zero anaphora was foundmost frequently in Thai documents and otheranaphora happened as show in table 9.Table 9: Types of referenceType of Anaphora Magazine news agricultureZero anaphora 49.88% 52.38% 50.04%repetition 32.04% 27.78% 34.49%personal reference 12.18% 12.70% 1.87%nominal substitution 5.90% 6.08% 13.60%Zero anaphora is the use of a gap, in a phraseor clause that has an anaphoric function similar toa pro-form.
It is often described as ?referringback?
to an expression that supplies theinformation necessary for interpreting the gapThe following is a sentence that illustrateszero anaphora:????????????????????
?????????
????????????????????
There are two roads to eternity, straightbut narrow, and broad but crooked.In this sentence, the gaps in straight butnarrow [gap], and broad but crooked [gap] havea zero anaphoric relationship to two roads toeternity.Table 10 also shows the occurrence of zeroanaphora in various parts of a sentence.Table 10: Position of reference in sentencesPosition FrequencySubject 49.88%Object 32.04%Possessive Pronoun 12.18%Following a Preposition 5.90%It is noticeable that zero anaphora in theposition of the subject occurs with high frequency(49.88%).
It shows that in Thai language, theposition of subject is the most commonlyreplaced.3.3.3 Iterative Relative ClauseThai relative pronouns ?????
(thi) ?????(sung)?
and ????(un)?
relate to group of nouns or other pronouns(The student  ?????
(thi)  studies hardest usually doesthe best.).
The word  ?????
(thi) connects or relatesthe subject, student, to the verb within thedependent clause (studies).
Generally, we use ?????
(thi)  and  ?
?????(sung)?
to introduce clauses that areparenthetical in nature (i.e., that can be removedfrom the sentence without changing the essentialmeaning of the sentence.
The pronoun ?????
(thi) and ?????(sung)?
refers to things and people and ????
(un)?usually refers to things, but it can also refer toevent in general.The relative pronoun is sometimes omittedbecause it makes the sentence more efficient andelegant.?
???????
???/????

The Computational ModelThe computational models in word and phraselevel are developed according to the phenomenamentioned in section 3.4.1 Unknown Word ExtractionUnknown word extraction model composes of2 sub-modules: unknown word recognition andname entity identification.4.1.1 Unknown word recognitionThe hybrid model approach has been used forunknown word recognition.
The approach is thecombination of a statistical model and a set ofcontext based rules.
A statistical model is used toidentify unknown word?s boundary.
The set ofcontext based rules, then, will be used to extractthe unknown word?s semantic concept.
If theunknown word has no context, a set of unknownword information, which has defined throughcorpus analysis, will be generated and the best onewill be selected, as its semantic concept, by usingthe semantic tagging model.

The model based onheuristic rules and mutual information.
Mutualinformation or statistical analysis of wordcollocation is used to solve boundary ambiguitywhen names were composed with known andunknown words.
We use Knowledge based suchas list of known name (such as country names),clue word list (such as person?s title) to supportthe heuristic rules.
Using clue word or commonnoun that precedes the name can specify NEcategorization.
Based on the case grammar, NEcategories can also defined.
Moreover, the lists ofthe names from predefined NE Ontology can beused for predicting category too.
The overview ofour system is shown in figure 7.
More detail sees(Chanlekha, H. et al 2002)4.2 New Word GenerationWord formation is proposed to reduce thelexicon size by constructing new words orcompound noun from the existing words.
Basedon word formation rules and common dictionary,the shallow parser will extract a set of candidatecompound nouns.
Then probabilistic approachbased on syntactic structure and statistical data isused to solve the problem of over- and under-generation of new word construction and prunethe erroneous of compound noun from thecandidate set.
The process of new wordconstruction is shown in figure 8.
See more detailin (Pengphon, N. et al 2002)Figure 8 : New Word Construction process4.3 Noun Phrase RecognitionEntities or concepts are usually described bynoun phrases.
This indicates that text chunks likenoun phrases play an important role in humanlanguage processing.
In order to analyze NP, bothstatistical and linguistic data are used.

At thesecond step, the compound word is grouped intoone word by using word formation module (see4.2).
The third step, statistical-based technique isused to identify phrase boundary.
This step wasprovided for identifying the phrase boundary byusing NP rules.
Next step is Noun PhraseSegmentation.
The condition of noun phrasesegmentation is shown in figure 10.After noun phrase is correctly detected, therelation in noun phrases will be extracted.
Thereare 2 types of relation: head-head noun phrase andhead-modifier noun phrase.
The process is basedon statistical techniques by considering thefrequency (fi) of each word (wi) in the document(See figure 11).5.
ConclusionThe computational language models forThai in word and phrase level, consisting ofUnknown Word Extraction and Name Entitiesidentification, New word generation and Nounphrase recognition, are studied on the basis oftheir behavior analysis from the varieties ofcorpus.
We expected that it could create cost-effective solutions to the practical problems in theapplication developments especially in ThaiInformation Retrieval and Information extractionsystem.
We also give the gateway to access Thailanguage resources with hoping that it could bethe bridge of the international collaboration fordeveloping Multi-Language Processingapplications.AcknowledgementThis project has been supported by NECTEC.Reference[1]  Bourigault, D.?Surface Grammatical Analysisfor the Extraction of Terminological NounPhrases?.
