J !Information and Deliberation in DiscourseMar i lyn  A. Walker*l yn@l inc .c i s .upenn.edu1 In t roduct ionTile most common assumption about intention in discourse is that the primary intention of discourse is toeomlnunicate and receive information.
This is a founding assumption of every formal model of discoursemeaning that I am aware of.
The standard account of meaning is that utterances are functions from contextsto contexts whose primary purpose is to describe the world, and whose meaning derives from the fact that theydelimit the set of worlds that the conversants believe possible.
One of the ramifications of this assumption isthat utterances with no new information are infelicitous or have no meaning\[i, 2, 14, 5\].
However, considerexample 1, asserted by a passenger in a vehicle in response to tile driver's comment hat the heavy trafficwas unexpected:(I) There's somet, hing on fire up there.
I can't see what's on fire, but SOMETHING IS.
(LW 6/12/92)In the first clause of 1, tile speaker asserts a proposition P, namely that something is on fire.
In thesecond clause, the speaker presupposes P, and finally in the third clause the speaker affirms P. I will arguethat examples like this show that a theory of discourse meaning must account for DELIBERATION-basedintentions.
The DELIBERATION-based view emphasizes that agents produce utterances to support otheragents' deliberations about what they want to believe or what they want to do.
Agents don't take it forgranl.ed that their assertions will be accepted by other agents.
I will call clauses like the third one aboveINFORMATIONALLY REDUNDANT UTTERANCES, henceforth (IRUs).
In the examples given here, IRUs areshown in CAPS.
The IRU's ANTECEDENT, the utterance which originally added the IRU's propositionalcontent to the discourse, is shown in italics.Section 2 discusses deliberation in discourse.
I will show how a set of assumptions about deliberation accountfor many examples of IRUs in discourse.
Then in section 3, I will briefly discuss how some RST relationscan I)e viewed as heuristic strategies for achieving DELIBERATIoN-based intentions\[9\].2 De l iberat ionDELIBERATION as a component of a theory of intention in discourse is functionally related to the theory ofeconomic rationality, which in recent years has augmented the INFORMATION-based (logical) view of action\[3\].
DELIBERATION is the process by which an agent explicitly or implicitly evaluates a set of alternatesill order to decide what s/he wants to believe and what course of action s/he wants to pursue.
1 Thusagents deliberate about whether  as well as how to revise their beliefs and intentions as they receive newinformation\[4\].
This is partially reflected in the following ATTITUDE assumption\[16\]:?
ATTITUDE: Agents deliberate whether to ACCEPT or REJECT an assertion or proposal made by anotheragent in discourse.
*This research was partial ly funded by ARO grant DAAL03-89-C0031PRI and DARPA grant N00014-90-J-1863 at theUniversity of Pennsylvania, nd by Hewlett Packard, U.K.1 Evaluation flmctions (utilities) for beliefs may have a different basis than those for intentions.144Empirical analyses of dialogue can inform an account of deliberation because dialogue provides an explicitprotocol of which facts agents believe will affect the ACCEPTANCE or REJECTION of an a~ssertion or proposal.An analysis of IRUs in problem-solving dialogues hows that the process of deliberating about beliefs dependson the type of evidence support ing a belief, and that one of the primary functions of IRUs is to upgradethe strength of the evidence supporting beliefs\[18, 17, 20\].
Beliefs that are strongly supported cohere withother beliefs and are more difficult to defeat\[4\].
The process of deliberating about intentions also dependson evidence support ing beliefs that  the intention is based on, which can contribute to a perception of 'r isk'.However, there is an addit ional independent  factor that contributes to deliberating about intentions: theuti l ity of the resulting 'p lan ' \ [ i l l .
2 IRUs fimction communicatively to support both deliberative processes.Because of the ATTITUDE assumption, there are two fundamental relations in discourse between beliefs andintentions and their support ing beliefs.
The SUPPORT relation links beliefs at various endorsement levels,e.g.
a premise supports a conclusion and endorses it as an ENTAILMENT\[6, 17\].
The WARRANTS relationlinks beliefs with intentions that they are a warrant for, e.g.
the belief that you will make a 15% profit mayprovide a WARRANT for an intention to pttrchase Hewlett Packard stock.
Of course, measurable benefits ofintentions are the simplest ease.In addit ion to the factors noted above, other processing factors such as the frequency and salience of beliefscontribute to dei'iberation.
Furthermore, preferences may be relevant, so that other things being equal, humanagents believe what they prefer to believe\[8, 4\].
These factors are reflected in the following assumptions:?
PREFERENCE: Agents' beliefs are partial ly determined by their p re ferences  about what to believe,which may have a nonlogica\] basis.AFFIRMATION: Repeat ing  a proposition is a weak type of SUPPORT that provides evidence of thespeaker's commitment to the truth of the proposition.
In addition, affirnlation makes a propositionsalient, and may increase the frequency of that prol)osition in memory.Tile AFFIRMATION assumption means that the occurrence of an affirmation is a cuc that the speaker beliew~sthat s/he must provide addit ional SUPPOrtT for his/her assertions.
3 This speaker belief is most often moti-vated by the perception that some propositions in the discourse are in opposition with one another\[19, 7\].In other words, if a proposition P is atlirmed in a context C, something in C must either support or warrantan opposite conclusion Q, or fail to support or warrant P. For example, consider 2, which demonstrates anopposition in supl)ort , apparently hased on the conlnlon-sense inference that torment leads to nnprodnctivity(Ward's 96)\[19, 7\]:(2) Tchaikovsky was one of the most tormented men in musical history.
In fact, one wonders how hcmanaged to produce any music at all, BUT PRODUCE MUSIC HE DID.
, \ [WFLN Radio\]Examl)le 1 is also motivated by the speaker's goal to provide support, and shows that the speaker 1)eliew;sthat visual evidence would support her claim that somclhiug is on fire.
It also shows that it.
is necessary torepresent he relation NOT-SUPPORT, since the fact that the speaker cau'l see whal's on fire fails to SUl)l)Ol'tthe belief that something is on fire, without supporting its negation.
Example 3 is also inotivated hy acombinatiol~ of the AFFIRMATION and ATTITUDE assurnptions, where, as in example 1, the speaker statesthat she cannot  provide support for her claim:(3) I like you Lizzy.
I don't know why I like you.
But I LIKE YOU.
(CS, 3/4/92)Silnilarly, in example 4, the relevant relation seems to be NOT-WARRANT:2The independence of these factors is easy to see in a simplified omain such as DesignWorld \[16, 15\], ill which two agentsmust attempt to maximize utility while negotiating a COLLABORATIVE PLAN for the design of a two room house, and where theutility of tile design plata is a function of the values of the individual pieces of furniture that make up the plan.
Imagine thatthere is a default rule that if an agent can't remember the value associated with a piece of furniture, then s/he can assumethat it is worth 1O0 points.
Then a proposal to include that.
piece of furniture in the final plan would have high utility for thatagent, but the belief is not well supported.3Not all 1RUs in discourse function as alfir,nat.ions \[16\].145d(4) lie didn't  make a profit from doing it, but l i e  DID IT.These examples all demonstrate that often the best support for deliberation that a speaker can provide ishis/her own AFFIRMATION of the relevant fact.
In general, IRUs motivated by SUPPORT are characterizedby verbs referring to typical sources of evidence for propositions being deliberated, e.g.
see, hear, say, aswell as mental state verbs reflecting deliberation, know, remember.
IRUs motivated by WirtltAN'r refer toinl.eutionality, costs, or benefits of a course of action as in 4..The ATTITUDE and PR.EFER.ENCE assumptions motivate xample 5, where what is relevant is that tile speakerbelieves l.hat the hearer may not want to accept the assertion of P, preferring to believe -~ P ( l lorn's 323)\[7\].
(5) It 's unfortunate that you failed, but FAIL YOU DID.It is possible that P in 5 conflicts with the hearer's view of herself as extremely intelligent, or that tileaccel)tance of P would lead the hearer to infer a number of conclusions which she would prefer not to derive.Factivc predicates for other relations that express the difficulty of accepting a proposit ion are odd, strange,surprising, amazing, I 'm sorry that, Ii's a wonder that, and all of these also license affirmation.Finally, when two opposing facts are supported by the same quality of evidence, e.g.
linguistic, other factorsmay be important.
In example 6, Jennifer, (j), has received verbal advice from two different sources.
Bothof the statements shown in CAPS are IRUs, and reflect her deliberation process, showing that what seemsto be relevant is the source  of these two opposed belieEs: 4(?~) 11.
Jennit~.r I understand what you're saying attd I 'm sorry 1 have to tell you that, 1 really am..i.
Well, I 'm, 1 have more faith in you than what he told me,l iE SAID I DIDN'T  HAVE TO FILE,BUT THEN YOU JUST TOLD ME I DOII.
Yes.
and 1 wouldn't want to see you get, in trouble.3 In format ion ,  De l iberat ion  or Cont ras tI'w- argued that supl)orl.iug deliberation is a fundamental iuteul, ion iu discourse.
In section 2, l showed howexamples of IRUs that would I)e analyzed with RST relations of CONTItAST, MOTIVATION and EXPLANATIONare motivated by the intention to support deliberation.
One potential integration of rhetorical relation andintention-based theories of discourse is to view schema~s for contrast, ntotivation and explanation as heuristicstrategies for achieving discourse intentions of deliberation\[13\].
However, there are a residue of contrastexamples for which it is difficult to give a deliberation account.
Example 7 demonstrates that a set-baseddefiuil.ion of contrast easily SUl)l)orts affirmation\[12\], l lere the sl)eaker is talking about a recent vacation toM~xico.
(7) We always had water (in that room).I think we were the only ones,WE NEVER RAN OUT OF WATER.l lot  water, we ran out of.but WE ALWAYS t lAD WATER.
(Viv 3/20/92)It is unclear whether tile affirmations in this example are motivated by tile fact that Viv believed that heraudience were unwilling to accel)t her assertions without further support.
Ilere, Viv seems to be caught ina rlmtorical schema as she enumerates two sets in set-based contrast.
First, We, the others is enumeratedwith the affirmation and negation of having water.
Then a second set, hot water, cold water is enumeratedwith the att i rmation/negation of running out of it.
A challellge for the account presented here is to explainwhat kind of intention motivates Viv's affirmations.4This excerpt is fl'om a radio talk show for financial advice.
