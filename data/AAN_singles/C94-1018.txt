MODALS AS A PROBLEM FOR MTby Bengt Sigurd & Barbara Gawr6nskaDept of Linguistics and Phonetics, Lund University, Swedene-mail:Bengt.Sigurd @ling,lu.seSummaryTim paper demonstrates tim problem oftranslating modal verbs and phrases and showshow some of these problems can be overcomeby choosing semantic representations whichlook like representations of passive verbs.These semantic representations suit alternativeways of expressing modality by e.g.
passiveconstructions, adverbs and impersonal con-structions in the target language.
Variousrestructuring rules for English, Swe(lish andRussian am presented.IntroductionModal verbs belong to the ,nest frequentEnglish words.
Clauses with modalexpressions make up a considerable part of theclauses of any text, why any MT-systemwhich is claimed to cover empirical texts withreasonable quality must include solutions to theproblems discussed in this paper (cf.
An et al1993 for a corpus based approach).
One of theproblems connected with the analysis of suchclauses is the fact that the distinction betweenauxiliaries and medals is not clear.
Verbs likeought to and dare (to) are often labelled semi-auxiliaries, begin and continue are calledaspectual verbs etc.
A common denominator fauxiliaries, semi-auxiliaries, medals and sev-eral perception verbs is their "auxiliary mean-ing" including tense, modality and aspectualperspective (of.
Gawrofiska, 1993).
In thefollowing, the term "auxiliary "will be usedeven when referring to verbs traditionallycalled medals and perception verbs.The typical "auxiliary" meanings, e.g.modality, aspectual perspective and tense showgreat encoding variation between languages.And even within one language one may oftenchoose between several different lexical-grammatical modes.
In English one maychoose between X may come, It is possiblethat X comes, and X possibly comes with onlyminor stylistic differences.Swedish kan has both a root meaning(equivalent o is able to) and an epistcmicmeaning (equivalent to may), while Englishcan only has the first meaning.
The mode ofencoding auxiliary meanings may be evenmore differentiated in other languages.
Thus,He must come, has to be rendered by thepassive construction II est obligd de venir orthe impersonal construction ll fimt qu'il viennein French.
In Russian one would have had torender this sentence using an an adjective(dolZen) or an adverb (nado, neobxodimo).Japanese would have to use konakerebanarimasen (literally: "It won't do if X does notcome").
MT-systems dealing with a certainpair of languages may tailor the meaningrepresentations of auxiliaries ad hoc, but multi-language systems uch as Swelra, the SwedishComputer Translation Project (Sigu,'d &Gawrohska, 1990), must choose moreuniversal representations and suitable restruct-uring transfe," rules its will be demonstrated.Tim p,'oblem of modality is also of generalinterest for linguistic, semantic and cognitivetheo,'y (Sweetser, 1990).English Verb PhrasesThere are two basic types of verb phrases inEnglish (el Sigurd, 1992), one (1) consistingonly of a finite main verb (with possiblecomplements), e.g.
Bill jumps, the other (2)consisting of a finite auxiliary verb followedby a non-finite main verb (with possiblecomplements), e.g.
Bill must.jtmTp.
The non-finite main verb in the second type may be inthe infinitive without o as illustrated, or in aninfinitive with to as in Bill began re jump.
Thenon-finite verb may also be a past participle asin Bill has.fltml)ed or a present participle as inBill began.jtt,ll)ing.
The choice between on-finite forms is an automatic consequence of thepreceding verb.
We note that the have meaningperfect lense takes the perfect participle as inBill has juml)ed, while the have which is anequivalent of must takes the infinitive with toas in Bill has to.iump.
The verb begin may takean infinilive with to (Bill began to.jmnp) oralternatively a present participle (Bill beganjttmping).
The auxiliaries in other languages,e.g.
German and Swedish display similarcombinatorial properties.The second type o1' verb phrase mentioned maybe expanded to include further non-finiteauxiliaries, as illust,'ated in: Bill must.~B i l l  must dare to hegin t().jumj2 imd Billre,st &tr?
to he?in to be able to.jmni~Occasionally there may be a short adverbbetween the non-finite forms as in Bill must120dare not to j!tmp and even after a to as in Billmust dare to not jttmp, although the so calledsplit infinitive construction is condemned byprescriptive grammarians.Semantic Representations o1' VerbPhrasesThe meaning complexes corresponding to theverb phrases described may simply berendered as lists of the constituent verbmeanings, where the tense of the finite verb isshown, but the particular form of non-finiteverbs and tim occurrence or non-occurrence ofinfinitive markers are not shown.
This is theapproach taken by Swetra.
The lexical meaningrepresentations or semantic markers in Swetratire of the form re(S, G), where m denotesmeaning, S is the main meaning of the worddenoted by a kind of Machincse English and Gthe grammatical meaning.
The verb formjumps has the ,'epresentation m(i,mp, pres).The rnearfings of the infinitive form (to).jump,the past participle jumped and the presentparticiplcjttml)ing are ;ill rendered as re(jump,nonf).
The following table shows some pre-liminary meaning representations of verbphrases under the phrases.j ,  mpsIra(jump, pres) lbegan to jump\[m(jump, non f), re(begin, past)\]began jumpingIra(jump, non f\], re(begin, past)tdare begin to jtmll~Ira(jump, nonf), re(begin, nonf),re(dare, pros)\]may be able to jmnl)Ira(jump, n.onl), m(ahle, nonf), re(may, pres)\]was painted\[re(paint, nonf), re(passive, past)lThe semantic representations ilhtstrated havethe main verh first and the order of tim verbs isthus reversed if compared to l';nglish.
Theorder chosen is arbitrary.
We have illustratedtim representation of a passive phrase waspainted as well.
This representation is alsoused for the Swedish morphological passivewhich is mr~tlades (there is also a syntacticpassive in Swedish: bh, v .,glad).Passive Meaning Representations l'orsome Auxil iariesLinguists have often talked about he meaningsof auxiliaries using words and concepts uchas: compulsion, obligation, permission,ability, necessity, prohahility and possibility.Words which can be associated withcompulsion and obligation, e.g.
muvt, s'hallought to have been called deontic.
A d~stmctmnbetween a root me,'ming and an epistcmicincasing has been observed for a number ofauxiliaries, e.g.
must, where the two meaningsare illustrated by the following two examples(from Swectser, 1990, p, 49).Bill must be home by ten; Mother won't lethim stay out any longerBill must be home already; I see h& coatThe epistemic meaning may also be renderedby sentence adverbials as illustrated by: Bill isevidentlyZs'eemingly home or an impersonalexpression with an adjective as in It is clem?obvious that Bill is home.
It would be anadvantage if the semantic representations ofauxiliaries could bE related in a simple way tothe meaning representations of such equivalent:.ldverbs and adjectives.The simplest way to represent the meanings ofauxiliaries is illustrated by re(can, pres).
It isthen logical to choose m(ccm, nonf) fo," theassumed infinitive be able to.
Similarly, onemay represent the meaning of present mttst bym(,m.~'t, pres) and and the meaning of timcorresponding infinitive be obliged to bym(mttst, non.f).
The phrase be obliged to can,however, also be regarded as a passive inwhich case it would be represented as:Ira(oblige, non.\['), re(passive, nonf)\].
With thisrepresentation i mind one may representpresent must as/re(oblige, nonf), re(passive,pres)\] instead imdcan as Ira(able, non\]),re(passive, pres)\] which directly gives us thesynonym is able to.ThEre are l'urthcr semantic arguments in favourof representing constn~ctions with modal verbsin a wlty similar to passive clauses.
Thereferent of the subject in a sentEncE with amodal verb is not as "agentivc" as the referentof the suhjcct of a typical active content verb.I f  the term agent is to be understood ;is theclement of tim event-situation that is activelyinvolved in and responsible for tim triggeringof tim Event-situation i  question (Oawrofiska1993), it becomes clear that the subject of amodal construction is not a typical agent.
Itsresponsibility lkn" triggering the event-situationis reduced by the obligation, allowance orcompulsion component.
In Russian andPolish, tiffs property of tim subject referent isovertly expressed by the dative case in severalmodal construction.
The equivalent of theEnglish or Swedish!
subject in RussiansentEnCes with nado ('it is obligatory'),121neobxodimo ('it is necessary'), nel'zja ('it isnot allowed') or Polish wolno ('it is allowed')occurs in the dative, a case normally associatedwith the semantic roles 'beneficiary' or'experiencer'.Passive representations of someEnglish auxil iariesOne may hesitate wben choosing terms in tilemeaning representations a is obvious fi'omworks on modals.

This meaning may beillustrated by Bill may come (as he asked).

), 1, toinf, i, It)--> \[seem I.This analysis makes the phrase Bill isperceived to come parallel to Bill seems tocome, which is reasonable, although the firstphrase seems to he too specific and implies alatent agent.
This epistemic meaning is alsoexpressed by grammarians by such words as:inference, conclusion.There is a number of cpistemic expressionswhich indicate the sense modality of theperception more or less clearly as illustratedby: Bill is said~heard/felt to come./* epistemic possibility, probability, certaintyelex(\[m(possible, nonl), m(passive, pres)\], v,aux, fin, _, 1, inf, i, \[\]) --> \[may\].elex(\[m(pmbable, non0, re(passive, pres)\], v,aux, fin, _, l, toinf, i, \[\]) --> \[ought\].elex(\[m(certain, nonl), m(passive, pres)\], v,aux, fin, _, 1, inf, i, \[\]) --> \[shall\].The semantic representations of auxiliariesmust be sensitive to tim presence/absence ofnegation.
The equivalent of English mzgst,when not negated, is the etymologically relatedSwedish verb mc~ste, whereas must not is notto be rendered by m()ste inte ('must' not), butbyfi~r inte ('is not allowed to').
The need forattention to negation becomes even moreconspicuous when considering tile effects ofthe interplay between egation and aspect intranslation between Russian and English (cf.Isa~enko 1962: I98):a. nado vernut' knigu'must' relurn-perf book-ace'one has to return the book/lbe book must bereturned'b.
nado vozvra,~at' knigi'must' return-imp books-nom/acc'one ought to return books'c.
ne nado vozvrag~:at' dtu kniguneg 'must' return-imp tiffs book-ace'one does not need/have to return tills book'Tile problem of translation between Englishand Russian can be solved by lexically en-coded negation and aspect control, accordingto patterns like the following:elex(lm(oblige, nonl), re(passive, pros)\], v,aux, fin, _, 1, inf, i, 1711) --> \[must\].rlex(\[m(oblige, nonl).m(passive, pres)l, adv,rood, inf, \[perfl, 1 .

\[I)--> Inadc, l.The Russi,'ul lexical entry (rlex) contains theinformation that an English modal verb withthe meaning code m(obl igue, nonf),re(passive, pres) is to be rendered by theRussian modal adverb nado, provided thatnado is not negated and that it is combinedwith a perfective infinitive clause \[perf\].Negation would have shown in the slot nowmarked \[perfl.This pattern covers casesexemplified by a.
The other patterns arehandled in an analogous way.122English and Swedish equivalentsIt is evident from the analysis above that thereis a number of auxiliaries which can betranslated directly as a consequence of thesemantic representations suggested.

It will thenhave to make changes in the functionalrepresentation a d move parts of the meaningrepresentations.
The following is a generalProlog rule, which moves the epistemicmeaning from the predicate to the adverb.
Therule assumes the analysis of auxiliariespresented above and suitable lexical represent-ations.
The rule states that if there is a structuresuch as A, there is also B.instruct(A, B) :-A=\[pred(\[m(X, non0\], \[m(Epist, _)\],m(passive, T)II),advl(\[\])\], % N may comeB= \[pmd(\[m(X, T)\]),advl(m(Epist, _))\].% N comes possiblyNote how tim tense morpheme (T) is alsomoved.The following rule ilhlstrated how/t ispossible that Bill colll(L'?

Itpresupposes a certain syntactic analysis whereEnglish it is represented asiml)ers.restruct(A, B) :-A= \[subj(N), pred(\[m(X, non0, Im(Epist, _)l,re(passive, T)\]\])\], % N may comeB=\[subj(impers), pred(lm(Epist, _),re(passive, pres)\]),obj(lsubj(N), pred(m(X, T))\])I.% It is l~ossible Ih(lt N comesIn translation from and into Russian, there is aneed for rendering an impersonal construction,like nado vernut' knig,, into an English orSwedish construction with an overtly realizedsubject (E. The book must be returned, S.Boken m&'te liimnas tillbaka).
In such cases,tile 'restruct' rules move the representation fthe Russian object into the subjecl slot of thetarget representation a d instantiale the modevariable in the constant 'passive'.
The definite-heSS value of the subject is assumed to be, bydefault, +definite, which generally holds forperfective constructions with singular objectsand preverbal subjects.restruct (A, B):-A= \[subj(\[l), pred(\[m(Verb, \[nonf, perfl),Aux, Tense, Mode\]), obj(m(Z, _))1,% nado vetvult' kn&uB= \[subj(m(Z, def)), pmd(\[m(Verb, nonl),Aux, in(passive, Tense)D\]/% the book must be returnedAs an alternative, the empty subject slot isfilled by a generic personal (genpers) pronoun(E. one, S. man):restruct (A, B):-A= \[subj(\[\]), prod(Ira(Verb, \[nonl', pert'l),Aux, Tense, Mode\]), obj(m(Z, _))\],% nado vermtt' kniguB-- \[subj(m(genpers, _), pred(\[m(Verb, nonf),Aux, re(passive, Tense)\]), obj(m(Z,dem))\].%) one must return this bookSuch rules may be used as transfer rules in MTsystems.
They may also be used in oMer toderive synonynlous expressions in the samehmguage.
Some subtle semantic and stylisticdifferences between the target and the sourcesentences ometimes occur.
However, thetranslations are generally comprehensible.ReferencesAn, D. U., Kim, G. C., Lee, J. H & Muraki,K.
