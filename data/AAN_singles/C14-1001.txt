Proceedings of COLING 2014, the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers,page 1, Dublin, Ireland, August 23-29 2014.Learning from 26 Languages: Program Management and Science in theBabel ProgramMary HarperIncisive Analysis OfficeIntelligence Advanced Research Projects ActivityOffice of the Director of National IntelligenceUSAmary.harper@iarpa.govInvited Speaker AbstractThis presentation will illustrate how program management and science can cooperate to increase ourunderstanding of human languages and algorithms for processing them.
In this presentation, I will usethe IARPA Babel program as an example.
The goal of the Babel Program is to rapidly develop speechrecognition capability for keyword search in new languages, working with speech recorded in a varietyof conditions and with limited amounts of transcription.
The speech data is recorded in native countriesand contains variability in speaker demographics and recording conditions.
The Program will ultimatelyaddress a broad set of languages with a variety of phonotactic, phonological, tonal, morphological, andsyntactic characteristics.
I will discuss the data resources collected to support the research, the challengesthat performers have faced when working with a variety of languages collected in realistic environments,the lessons learned, and future directions.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.
