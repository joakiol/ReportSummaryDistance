On keeping logic in its placeYorick WilksComputing Research Laboratory,New Mexico State University,Las Cruces, NM, 88003.There need be no real dispute on this panel about what is meant, in the broadestterms, by formal semantics (FS) when opposed to common-sense semantics (CSS):after registering his complaints and worries, the opposition David Israel opts for in hispaper is broadly the one adopted here, and the model-theoretic semanticists he men-tions will do just fine for me, and I suspect for Karen Sparck-Jones in her characterisa-tion of a "logicist" approach to natural language processing.
As will appear below,though, I want to list a range of strengths of FS commitment ,  not  all of which aremodel-theoretic.
So, whatever we find to argue about on this panel, it needn ' t  bethose two terms.Formal semantics (henceforth FS), at least as it relates to computationallanguage understanding, is in one way rather like connectionism, though without thecrucial prop Sejnowski's work (1986) is now widely believed to give to the latter: bothare old doctrines returned, like the Bourbons having learned nothing and forgottennothing, but FS has nothing to show as a showpiece success after all the intellectualgroaning and effort.
Here, I must  register a small historical protest at Israel's claimthat "unt i l  Montague, undeviatingly, the techniques of pure mathematical semanticswere deployed for formal or artificial languages" It all depends what you mean bytechniques, but Carnap in l~is Meaning and Necessity (1947) certainly thought  he wasapplying Tarskian insights to natural language analysis.
And the arguments urround-ing that work, and others, were very like those we are having now.
I need that point ifthe Bourbon analogy is to stick: FS applied to natural anguages is anything but new.But there have been recent changes in style and presentation i  the purely com-putational area as a result of the return: many working in the computational semanticsof natural language now choose to express their notations in ways more acceptable toFS than they would have bothered to do, say, ten years ago.
That may be a gain forperspicuity or may be a waste of time in individual cases, but there are no clear exam-ples, I suggest, of computational systems where a FS theory offers anything integral orfundamental  to the success of the processes that could not have been achieved bythose same processes described at a more common-sense l vel (what I am callingcommon-sense semantics, or CSS).
However, I do not at all intend to define CSS byany particular type or level of notational description: by it I mean a primary commit-ment  to the solution of the main problems of language processing, those problemsthat have not obstructed progress in the field for thirty years.
That set I take toinclude: large scale lexical ambiguity (i.e.
against realistically large sense ambiguity forlexical items of English), the problems of phrase, and other constituent, attachment,where those require meanings to fix, and the whole mass of problems that collectaround the notions of expertise, plans, intentions, goals, common knowledge, refer-ence and its relationship to topic assumption etc.124Hence, on these descriptions of FS and CSS they are not necessarily exclusive: itwould be quite conceivable for an FS system to aid with the solution of a problemimportant o CSS.
And it will always be possible for a successful CSS theory to be sub-sequently axiomatised---but that does not equate CSS and FS and more thanaxiomatising physics does away with experiments: theories come first, axiomatisationsfollow.
My case is that that has not in fact happened in natural language processingand there is no reason to believe it will, because the origins and ultimate preoccupa-tions of FS are always elsewhere.
The examples Israel chooses to discuss in detail(Henkin and Kripke) make my point exactly.
He says he could have taken others andthat " the nature of the languages tudied makes no essential difference".
But, as heseems to concede elsewhere in the paper, those are the very areas where the tech-niques can be shown to work and that is why they are always chosen (" the choice oftools ..... should be grounded somehow in the nature of the phenomena to beanalysed").
My case, to be set out in a little more detail below, is that the nature ofthe language chosen (natural versus artificial) makes as much difference as any choicecould make, and that in the last quotation Israel is dead right.A small concrete example may help: the choice between generating "a"  and" the"  is notoriously difficult in English, one that non-native speakers continually getwrong.
Examples are sometimes hard to see in one's  own language, and the choicebetween "des"  and " les"  in French is similarly crucial and notorious, though it is notthe same distinction, yet it rests on the same kind of semantic riteria.
It is not a prob-lem with an arbitrary solution: French grammar books always claim to offer principlesthat underlie the choice.It also seems, on the surface, to be a problem that FS or any logical approach tolanguage structure ought to help with: it is certainly some form of idiosyncraticquantification.
Those particles are exactly the kind that Montague grammar, say,offers large, complex structures for (just as, as Sparck-Jones notes in her paper, suchsystems offer such minimal, vacuous, codings for content words.
This is probably theclearest quantitative distinction between FS and CSS).
As far as I am aware no FSsolutions have ever been offered, or would seem remotely plausible if they were; atbest they would simply be a recoding in an alternative language of criteria satisfactorilyexpressed in other ways (see ~1 below).
Yet this is exactly the sort of place where FSshould offer help with a concrete problem if it is to be of assistance to the NLP task atall, for it is to such items that its representational ingenuity is devoted.The historical and intellectual source of FS lies in an alternative approach to whatconstitutes a proof: to meta-logical methods for the establ ishment of properties ofwhole systems, such as complete, consistent etc., and the employment  of such pro-perties as decidability to establish the validity of a theorem independently of normalproof-theoretic methods, i.e.
by semantic methods.
The applicability of this methodol-ogy has been perfectly clear in the case of programming languages, and to proofs ofcorrectness of programs (even if the scope of the applications is still depressinglysmall) but in the application to natural language understanding its original aims havesimply got lost.From time to time, an application within the original methodology surfaces, suchas Heidrich's proof (1975) of the equivalence of the methods of generative semanticsand Montague grammar, but the result proved is then seen to be vacuous, in theterms of CSS at least, in that nothing was established whose absence had constitutedany pre-existing problem.
The usefulness or (in)adequacy of generative semantics wasnot anything that could be established or questioned by the sort of guaranteed125equivalences that the proof offered.
The problems with generative semantics, whateverthey were, lay elsewhere and were not alleviated by any such proof.The heart of the issue is good old decidability, or whether or not  the sentences ofa language form a recursive set in any interesting sense.
It is clear to me that they donot  and I contrasted various sense in which they might back in 1971.
Contr ibutionsl i ke  Israel's only makes sense on the assumption that sentences do form some suchset, unless he is adopting only a "descriptive logical language posit ion" (#1 below),and his whole position paper suggests he is doing far more than that.The alternative position is that natural language is just not  a phenomenon of thesort required and assumed by the various systems of logic under discussion; and thatthe interpretation of any sentence in any context is an approximative matter ( includingwhether or not  it has a plausible interpretation at all, and hence whether or not  it is asentence at all), one computed by taking a best-fit interpretation from among anumber  of competing candidates, and that is not a process reducible to a decidable onein any non-trivial manner.
Indeed, I recall going further in (1971) and arguing (againstQuine, I think it was) that that process of assigning an interpretation to a string, fromamong competing candidates, could be taken as a criterion of having a meaning:namely, having one from among a set of possible meanings.
I ment ion this point forpurely self-serving reasons: I do not want Israel to get away with identifying CSS withSchank and Chomsky as he does.
I do not object to him joining them as bedfellows:that has been done before, all serious opponents are said to share premisses and, inthe case of those two, the similarities become clearer as time goes on.
Those are: acertain commitment  to genetic claims, but above all a commitment  to representationsrather than procedures.
My self-servingness i  to point out  that my owri approach,preference semantics, was not about commitment  to representations of a particularkind at all, but to certain procedures (based on coherence and connectedness ofrepresentations) as the right wayto  select interpretations from among competitors, forcompetitors there will always be.
CSS can be about procedures as much as representa-tions (Winograd has made a similar point in his (1985)).
In his own commitment  torepresentations, and dismissal of procedures ("semantics,  even construed as a theoryof language use, is not  directly a theory of processing") Israel is actually in the samebed with that distinguished company.
But not to worry, it is a big bed.Preference semantics was, in a clear sense, procedural and had the advantage ofdeclaring strings that did not admit the assignment of a single interpretation (i.e.remained ambiguous with respect o interpretation) as meaningless.
Meaninglessnesson that view was not having no meaning but having too many.
I found, and still findthat a satisfying position, one true to the process of language interpretation.
More-over, it offers an opportunity, it seems to me, for computation, processing, artificialintelligence, or what you will, to have something to say about fundamental  questionslike meaning.
It is clearly an assumption of Israel, and all who think like him., thatthat cannot be: "real semantics",  as he puts it, is being done elsewhere.It is one of the advantages of the connectionist fun and games, from my point ofview, that it has, against FS, brought implementation back to center stage from thewings; thus the new movement  can be of enormous  political interest and importance,whether or not one is a believer in it.
At  this workshop I know I shall feel like anant i -communist  a heist in Poland, hugely enjoying the sermons of Bishops.Let me try to separate levels (or may be just a cont inuum of positions or aspects)that the claims of FS make on natural anguage processing:1261) the use of a certain style of formal language of description of the basis of anysystem of natural language description or processing.
That this claim can be prettyweak can be seen clearly if we remember  McCarthy's insistence on first order forms ofexpression combined with his advocacy of heuristics ( indeed his claim that they consti-tute the essence of AI).
Hence, one can accede to this demand without giving any sup-port to the central part of the FS claim about decidability.2) Compositionality has been central to FS since Frege: from a computationalpoint of view that doctrine is almost certainly trivial or false.
I am sure this has beensaid many times; but I discovered it in (1984).3) an emphasis on the particular ole of quantifiers and the need of a field of dis-tinguished entities to quantify over (this is quite independent of #1,  and more centralto FS).
The set of distinguishable entities is easily given with Gensyms and doing thatin no way concedes the FS claim.
It must  be admitted that it was a notable weaknessin some early CSS systems (e.g.
Conceptual dependency or Preference Semantics)that they did not offer a clear identification of individual entities, independent ofintensional codings of concepts.
But that lack was so easily remedied.
The first demandcan always be met  by special quantifier procedures (e.g.
Woods, Winograd, in theirpapers on procedural semantics).
Nothing more is needed and demonstrat ions likeMontague's  stock example of radical quantifier ambiguity ( "Every  nice girl likes asailor.")
are effectively quantificational garden paths and no plausible natural languageprocessing system is under any obligation to treat them.
How could any system for therepresentation of natural language depend upon such cases, for they have no relationto crucial experiments in the sciences, but strong relations to the use methodologicaluse Chomsky has made of incomprehensible infinitely-nested sentences?4) reference ,and the world: the claim of FS to offer this is its weakest one, yetpractitioners return to it repeatedly.
If you don' t  adopt our methods,  the claim is, youare trading in mere symbols, unrelated to the real world we, as plain men, know weshare.
I never cease to be amazed at the barefacedness of this: the classic statement ofthe position is David Lewis' attack on Fodor and Katz as peddlers of markerese(1972).
But what else did he, or anyone else in FS, offer but symbol-to-symboltransformations?
What else could they, in principle, ever offer by any conceivable for-mal methods?
For symbols, and only symbols, are as much the trade and language ofthe denotational semanticist as of any computer modeller!
Whatever the mysteriousnature of the relation of symbols to things, it is not one on which FS could possiblythrow light.
Their solipsism is CSS's solipsism, and their position is metaphysicallyidentical to ours.Of course, arbitrarily named nodes identifying individuals are a handy, not to sayessential, device, but no monopoly of FS.
Worse yet, the proof procedures of FSdemand such sets of entities to quantifier over, but there is no formal way of guaran-teeing that the entities established (so as to provide the guarantees that the provedtheorems are true within the model that such entities form) are appropriate, in thesense of corresponding to any plausible real entities in the world.
Any model  setwhatever that allows proved theorems to be true would suffice for the purposes of FS.Proofs of program correctness have faced this problem but FS applied to naturallanguages and common sense reasoning has not and cannot.
Any claims to give accessby such means to a plausible and appropriate world are not only false but utterlymisleading as to the nature of FS.What we reach by any formal or computational methods is always other symbols,and a "theory of meaning" for computational process over natural language should127recognise this fact (a suggestion along these lines was made in Wilks 1974).An important additional claim of FS, certainly made in Israel's paper, is thatsemantics, whatever it is, must be separated off from knowledge of the world: "Lexi-ca\] semantics does not yield an encyclopedia" and "Any  plausible semantic account,then, will have to distinguish between analytic truths and world-knowledge".
It isinteresting to see that baldly and forthrightly stated without qualification, as if Quinewere not still alive and well, but had never been.
Practical experience with naturallanguage processing always suggests the opposite: Sparck-Jones shows in her paperhow this borderline has to be fudged by peculiar means in certain FS approach to prac-tical problems.
I am sure the Words and Worlds session of Tinlap3 will find no agree-ment whatever with the first quotation: real lexicons are such that information aboutmeanings and the world are inextricably mixed, or are simply alternative formulations(at least Carnap, in opposing his " formal"  and "material"  modes of expression, gotthat right in 1947)A final comment: we should notice the repeated offer, to our sloppy and heuristicdiscipline, of a Real Serious Theory for the field ( remember Chomsky's for machinetranslation and language wellformedness; and more recently FS's for the semanticsof selected AI systems).
The chances always are that this prescription is unrelated tothe disease; has Chomsky really helped language processing?
We do indeed need agood theory but these are quack cures trading chiefly on the fears and inadequacies ofpractitioners and patients in the field.One other consistent position is possible (I suspect it may be Dijkstra's, 1986):one can point out frequently, as he likes to do, the gap between the the interpretationsnormally given to logical entities (e.g.
propositional implication or conjunction) andthe interpretations usually given to apparently corresponding language items.
One canalso, at the same time, advocate the most stringent formal methods in computationalapplications to areas whose underly'ing structure or.
properties will support suchmethods.
By such standards, natural language is not such an area and therefore oneshould not attempt his form of computational ctivity.
That is a consistent position,but not one that most participants at Tinlap3 can take.
It poses no problem for CSSers,but does, I believe, put a serious choice before FSers who want to remain in someway relevant o real language processing.References:Carnap, R. (i947) Meaning and Necessity.Dijkstra, E. (1986) Public lecture at NMSU.Heidrich, C.M.
