15D-6900 Heidelberg, FRGAbstractKamp's Discourse Representation Theory is a majorbreakthrough regarding the systematic translationof natural language discourse into logical form.
Wehave therefore chosen to marry the User SpecialtyLanguages System, which was originally designed asa natural language frontend to a relational databasesystem, with this new theory.
In the paper we tryto show taking - for the sake of simplicity - Kemp'sfragment of English how this is achieved.
The re-search reported is going on in the context of thepro ject  Linguistics and Logic Based Legal ExpertSystem under taken  joint ly by the IBM He ide lbergScient i f ic  Center  and the Universit~it T i ib ingen.1 IntroductionIn th is  paper  we are concerned  with the systemat ict rans la t ion  of natura l  language d iscourse  into Dis-course  Representat ion  S t ructures  as they  are de-f ined in D iscourse  Representat ion  Theory  (DRT)f i r s t  formulated by Kamp (1981).
Th is  theory  re -p resents  a major b reakthrough in that  it sys temat -ically accounts  for the context  dependentin terpreta t ion  of sentences ,  in par t i cu la r  with re -gard  to anaphor ic  re lat ions .From a syntactic point of view, however, Kampchose a very restricted fragment of Engl ish.
It isour goal, therefore, to extend the syntactic cover-age for DRT by linking it to the grammars describedfor the User Specialty Languages (USL) system(Lehmann (1978), Ott and Zoeppritz (1979), Leh-mann (1980), Sopefia (1982), Zoeppritz (1984))which are comprehensive enough to deal with realis-tic discourses.
Our  main tasks are then to describethe syntactic framework chosenDiscourse Representation Structures (DRSs)the translation from parse trees to DRSsThe translation from parse trees to DRSs  will, as weshall see, not proceed directly but rather via Inter-mediate Structures.
which were already used in theUSL  system.
Clearly, it is not possible here to de-scribe the complete process in full detail.
We willhence limit ourselves here to a presentation Kamp'sfragment of English in our framework.The work repor ted  here  forms par t  of the deve l -opment of a Natura l  Language Ana lyzer  that  willt rans la te  natura l  language d iscourse  into DRSs andthat  is evo lv ing  out of the USL system.
We in tendto use this Natura l  Language Ana lyzer  as a par t  of alegal exper t  sys tem the const ruct ion  of which is theobject ive of a joint pro ject  of the Un ivers i ty  ofT i ib ingen and the IBM He ide lberg  Scient i f ic  Center .2 SyntaJc2.1 Syntactic framework and parsing processThe parser  used  in the Natura l  Language Ana lyzerwas  or ig inal ly  descr ibed  by Kay (1967) and subse-quent ly  implemented in the REL sys tem (Thompsonet .
al.
(1969)).
The Natural  Language Ana lyzeruses  a modif ied vers ion  of th is  parser  which is dueto Ber t rand  &al (1976, IBM (1981)).Each grammar rule contains the name of an inteP-pretation routine, and hence each node in the parsetree for a given sentence also contains the name ofsuch a routine.
The  semantic executer invokes theinterpretation routines in the order in which theyappear in the parse tree, starting at the root of thetree.2.2 Syntactic coverageThe  syntactic coverage of the Natural Language An-alyzer presently includesNounsVerbsAdjectives and adjectival phrases: gradation,modification by modal adverbial, modification byordinal number- Units of measure- Noun phrases: definiteness, quantification, in-terrogative pronouns, personal pronouns, pos-sessive pronouns, relative pronouns- Verb complements: subjects and nominative com-plements, direct objects, indirect objects, prepo-sitional objects- Noun complements: relative clauses, participialattribute phrases, genitive attributes, apposi-tions, prepositional attributes- Complements of noun and verb: negation, loca-tive adverbials, temporal adverbials- Coordination for nouns, noun phrases,adjectives, verb complexes and sentences- Comparative constructions- Subordinate clauses: conditionals- Sentences : declarative sentences, questions,commands3982.3 Syntax  ru les to cover the Kamp fragmentIn this section we give the categories and rules usedto process the Kamp fragment.
The syntax rulesgiven below are somewhat simplified with regard tothe full grammars used in the Natural Language Ana-lyzer, but they have been formulated in the samespirit.
For a detailed account of the German syntaxsee Zoeppritz (1984), for the Spanish grammar seeSopefia (1982).Syntactic categoriesWe need the following categories : <NAME>,<NOMEN>,  <QU>, <NP> (features: REL, PRO, NOM,ACC) ,  <VERB> (features: TYP=NI,  TYP=NA) ,<SENT>, <SC> (feature: REL).VocabularyThe vocabulary items we have taken from Ramp(1981).<NAME> : Pedro, Chiquita, John, Mary,Bill, ...<NOMEN:?NOM,?ACC> : farmer, donkey, widow,man, woman, ...<VERB:TYP=NI> : thrives, ...<VERB:TYP=NA> : owns, beats, loves, admires,courts, likes, feeds ....<QU> : a, an, every<NP:+PRO,+NOM> : he, she, it<NP:?PRO,+ACC> : him, her, it<NP: ?REL ,?NOM> : who, which, that<NP:?REL ,+ACC> : whom, which, that2.3 .

The  numbers  appear ing  as parame-te rs  to in terpreta t ion  rout ines  re fe r  to the  pos i t ionof the  categor ies  on the r ight  hand  s ide of theru les .
As can be seen ,  in terpreta t ion  rout ines  canbe nested  where  appropr ia te .

the  papers  by  Kamp (1981) and  Guenthner(1984a,  1984b) .According to DRT, each natural anguage sen-tence (or discourse) is associated with a so-calledDiscourse Representation Structure (DRS) on thebasis of a set of DRS forrnatior ules.
These rulesare sensitive to both the syntactic structure of thesentences in question as well as to the DRS contextin which in the sentence occurs.4.1 Definition of Discourse Representation Struc-turesA DRS K fo r  a d i scourse  has  the  genera l  fo rm K =<U, Con> where  U is  a se t  of  "d i scourse  re fe rents"fo r  K and  Con  a se t  of  "cond i t ions"  on  these  ind i -v idua ls .
Cond i t ions  can  be  e i ther  atomic orcomplex.
An atomic condition has the formP(tl,...,tn) or tl=c, where  ti is a discourse refer-ent, c a proper name and P an n-place predicate.Of  the  complex  cond i t ions  we wil l  on ly  ment ion" imp l i ca t iona l "  cond i t ions ,  wr i t ten  as  K1 IMP K2,where  K1 and  K2 are  a lso  DRSs .
With a d i scourse  Dis thus  assoc ia ted  a D iscourse  Representat ion  S t ruc -tu re  wh ich  represents  D in  a quant i f ie r - f ree"c lausa l "  fo rm,  and  wh ich  captures  the  propos i t iona limpor t  of  the  d i scourse .Among other things, DRT has important conse-quences for the treatment of anaphora which are dueto the condition that only those discourse referentsare admissible for a p ronoun that are accessible fromthe DRS in which the pronoun occurs (A precise de-finition of accessibility is given in Ramp (1981)).D i scourse  Representat ion  S t ruc tures  have  beenimp lemented  by  means  of  the  th ree  re la t ions  AS-SERT ION,  ACCESS IBLE ,  and  DR shown in the  ap-pend ix .
These  three  re la t ions  a re  wr i t ten  out  to there la t iona l  database  sys tem (Ast rahan  &al (1976) )  a f -te r  the  cur rent  text  has  been  processed .4.2 From Intermediate Structures to DRSsThe  Intermediate Structures are processed startingat the top.
The  transformation of all the items inthe Intermediate Structure are relatively straight-forward, except for the proper semantic represen-tation of pronouns.
According to the spirit of DRT,pronouns are assigned discourse referents accessi-ble from the DRS in which the pronoun occurs.
Inthe example given in the appendix, as we  can seefrom the ACCESS IBLE  table there are only two dis-course referents available, namely ul and u2.Given the morphological information about these in-dividuals the pronoun "it" can only be assigned thediscourse referent u2 and this is as it should be.For further problems arising in anaphora resolutionin general cf.
Kamp (1981) and Guenthner  and Leh-mann (1983).5 Remarks  on work  in p rogressWe are  a t  p resent  engaged in extend ing  the  aboveconst ruc t ion  a lgor i thm to a much w ider  var ie ty  ofl i ngu is t i c  s t ruc tures ,  in par t i cu la r  to the  ent i ref ragment  of  Eng l i sh  covered  by  the  USL  grammar .Bes ides  incorporat ing  qu i te  a few more  aspects  ofd i scourse  s t ruc ture  (p resuppos i t ion ,  ambigu i t i ty ,cohes ion)  we are  par t i cu la r ly  in teres ted  in  fo rmula t -ing  a deduct ive  account  fo r  the  re t r ieva l  ofin fo rmat ion  f rom DRSs .
Th is  account  wil l  ma in lycons is t  in  combin ing  techn iques  f rom the  theory  ofre la t iona l  database  query  as  wel l  as  f rom presenttechn iques  in  theorem prov ing .400In our opinion Ramp's theory of Discourse Repre-sentation Structures is at the moment the most prom-ising vehicle for an adequate and efficientimplementation of a natural language processing sys-tem.
It incorporates an extremely versatile dis-course-oriented representation language and itallows the precise specification of a number  of up tonow intractable discourse phenomena.ReferencesAstrahan, M.
