IntroductionThe study of text understanding andknowlegde extraction has been actively done by manyresearchers.
The authors also studied a method ofstructured information extraction from texts withouta global text analysis.
The method is available fora comparatively sbort text such as a patent claimclause and an abstract of a technical paper.This paper describes tile outline of a methodof knowledge extraction from a longer text whichneeds a global tex analysis.
The kinds of texts ~eexpository texts ~) or explanation texts-'.Expository texts described here mean those whichhave various hierarchical headings such as a title,a heading of each section and sometimes an abstract.In this deEinJtion, most of texts, includingtechnical papers reports and newspapers, areexpository.
Texts of this kind disclose the mainknowledge in a top-down manner and show not onlythe location of an attribute value in a text butalso severn\[ key points of the content.
Thisproperty of expository texts contrasts with that ofnovels and stories in which an unexpecteddevelopment of the plot is preferred.This paper pays attention to suchcharacteristics of expository texts and describes amethod of anal yzing texts by referring toinformation contained in the intersententialrelations and the headings of texts and thenextracting requested knowledge such as a summaryfrom texts in an efficient way.2.
Analysis of intersententia\] relationsTile global sentential analysis is performedby using the information contaJ ned in theintersentential relations and the headings of a textby a method combining both the bottom-up and thetop-down manner.
Various kinds of intersententialre lat ions\ ] \ ]~ve been proposed so far by manylinguists "--.
By referring to these proposals,intersentential relations are class\] liedtentatively into about 8 items.
They are a detail,an additional, a parallel, a rephrase, an example, atemporal succession, a cansal and a reasoningrelation as described in the following subsections.Detail relationsIf a term t 2 is the topic term J n a sentenceS 2 and i \ [  I: is a complementary term of the topLcterm t\] in the preceding sentence $I as shown inExpr.
(1), S,.
is called the detail of ~1"S ?

If thesentence S 3 is connected to S 1 more closely than $2,for example, if the sentence S 3 has the topic termtl of the sentence S\] as the topic, it isconsidered that the principal sentence is S and thesentence level of S~ is lower than that of ~..0 z " t n the other hand, if S I is an introductorysentence of a term t 2 and the articles related to t 2are described in some sentences following to $I, or I :if t~ is the ~,lobal topic of the section, the z sentence S is considered the principal sentence.\]'he global 2 topic can be easily identified byinspecting the headings of the section the title andthe like, whatever it :i s an attribute name or anattribute value without reading through the wholetext.If the term t 2 in the sentence S. belongs toa kind of pronouns such as "in the following ones"or "as follows", the sentence S J s set at the same 2 level as that of $I.
At the summarization stage, thesystem tries to s~orten the part consisting of S 1and S^ by replacing the pronoun t~ in S. by the main g z I content given :in S 2, namely, the main partconsisting of t .
and p .\[Example I\] r2 2(a) S\]: SGS receives an ordered triple from a user.$2: Tile triple's form is category, input-frames,conditions on the sentence.$3: SGS regards tile ordered triple as agoal.S O describes; the content of a term "orderedtriplg" in S\] , and S~ has tile topic term "SGS" inS Heine S is the ~e-a\[l of S ,and S is thei :  .

S has a kind of pronoun "tile following two 2 .
"structures whose contents are described Jn S 3.Hence, S is tile principal sentence and tile sentence 2 .
.
.
.
level of S_ is the same as that of S^ z " "As a sl)ecial case of detail relations, there area rephrase relation and an example relation.
TheseintersententJal relations between sentences S t andS 2 can be identified by referring to theirsentent:ial constructions and sentence modifyingadverbs such as "in other words" and "for example" .The principal sentence of them is, in most cases,the sentence S 1 Jn an expository text.Additional relationsIf the current sentence has the samesentential topic t. as that of the preceding \].sentences and describes another attributes or241functions of the topic, the current sentence iscalled an additional sentence to the precedingsentences.
The sentential form of the relation isS~:~ (PRED:p~,?
K.:t.,l =z Krl:tl)S : (PRED:p , K.:i., K " ~ (2)2The level~ ofJbT~h t~ 't2) sentences S and S 9 are l generally assumed to be the same except-for the casethat the global topic is put in a predicate part ofthem.
It can be also considered that additionalrelations hold among various sentential groups ofthe same \].eve\].
such as chapters sections orparagraphs under a global topic contained in atitle.3?~ Other sententJal relationsThere  are other intersentential relations.
Theyare roughly classified into a serial and aconcurrent or an extended parallel relation.A serial relation such as a temporal successiona caasal or a reasoning relation has tile samephysical locatioa of focus or the same logicalobject while it has a time shift or a logicalinference step shift between adjacent sententia\]groups .A concurrent relation has  the same t:i.me instantof the event occurrences or the same stages oflogical inference while Jt has a distance or aspatial positional shift hetween the physical or tilelogical objects described in the adjacent sententialgroul)s.The level number of a sentence to the adjacentsentential groups in these relations is assigned illa similar way to that of the detail or theadditional relation by referring to the inter-sentential relations and the global topics.In usual cases, the difference between aprincipal sentence level and the adjacent sentencelevel is usually set within one level.As seen in the above, a sentence or a sententialgroup has an intersentential relation to someadjacent sentences or sentential groups.
Theintersentential relation between adjacent sentencesis sinlilar to a relation between adjacent words orword groups combined through rewriting rules of asentence.
The intersentential relations areclassified into two classes.
One of them Js arelation such as a detail relation which holdsbetween a principal sentence and the auxiliary ormodifying sententJal group with a lower level thanthe principal sentence as shown :in Fig.\].(a).
Theother is a juxtaposition relation like an additionalrelation which holds among several coherentsentences with the same level in usual as shown inFJg.l(b).n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 .

The title shows tile maintopics of the text.
The heading of each sectionshows local topics of each section and constitutesthe attributes of the main top:ics.Each o f  maJ n sect ions  somet imes  has  ~lnin t roductory  remark  fo l lowed by the  main  par t .
