ac .ukAbstractA novel approach to Machine Translation (MT),called Shake-and-Bake, is presented, which ex-ploits recent advances iLL Computational Linguis-tics in terms of tile increased spread of lexicMistunification-based grammar theories.
It is arguedthat it overcomes some difficulties encountered bytransfer and interfingual methods.It offers a greater modularity of the monolingualcomponents, which can be written with indepen-dence of each other, using purely monofinguMconsiderations.
These are put into correspon-dence by means of a bilingual exicon.The Shake-and-Bake approach for MT consistsof parsing the Source Language in any usual way,then looking up the words in the bilinguM lexi-con, and finally generating from tile set of transla-tions of these words, but allowing the Target Lan-guage grammar to instantiate tile relative wordordering, taking advantage of the fact that theparse produces lexical and phrasal signs which arehighly constrained (specifically in the semantics).TILe main algorithm presented for generation isa variation on the well-known CKY one used forparsing.A toy bidirectional MT system was written totranslate between Spanish and Enghsh, and someof the entries are shown.1 Mot ivat ion'l/he research reported here was motivated by thedesire to exploit recent rends in Computational*The work reported here was carried out at the Univer-sity of Edinburgh under the support of a studentship fromthe Science and Engineering Research Council.

Depending on how much work isclone by the analysis and generation components,the tasks carried out by the transfer element mayvary, but iLL gener',d this module is very idiosyn-cratic and will involve several hundred transferrules.
Writing these transfer ules is the mosttime-consmning aspect of the design of a transfer-based system, as it nlust be consistent with hothnlonolingual grammars.
The process is thereforeerror-prone, and the result is not very portable,since the consequences of making changes to themonolingual components may be far-reaching asfar as the transfer ules are concerned.One of the mMu difficulties with interlingual ap-proaches is what Laudsbergen \[Landsbergen 87\]refers to as the subset problem.
If the system isto be robust, it is essential to guarantee that anyinterlingual formula derived from ally Source Lan-guage (SL) expression is amenable to generationinto tile Target Language (TL).
If the interlinguais powerful enough to represent all the meaningsin all tile languages involved, there will be severalt probably iatlnitely many) formulae in that inter ingua which are logically equivalent o the oneproduced by the analyser.
It cannot hen be guar-anteed that this fornmla comes under the cover-age or the TL generator, unless we can draw log-ical inferences in the interfingua.
The complexityof this task may be eompntationMly daunting,since suh-problems of this (such as satistiabilityand non-tautology) are known to be Nl'-complete(\[Garey and Johnson 1979\]).The approach presented here bears some similar-ity with that of \[Alshawi et al91\], which usesAcrEs DE COLING-92, NAIVI'~.

NAntES, AUG. 23-28, 1992the algorithm of \[Shieber et al 90\] for generationfrom quasi-logical forms.
On the other hand, gen-eration here takes place from a set of TL lexicalitems, with instantiated semantics, which makesthe task easier.This approach was tested with independently-written grammars for small yet linguistically in-teresting fragments of Spanish and English, whichare used both for parsing and generation.
Theseare put into correspondence by means of a bilin-gual lexicon containing the kind of informationone might expect to find in an ordinary bilingualdictionary.2 The  grammar  fo rmal i smA version of Unification Categorial Grammar(UCG) (\[Calder et al 88\]) is used.
Like manyother current grammatical formalisms (\[Shieber86\], \[Pollard and Sag 87\], \[Uszkoreit 86D, it rep-resents linguistic objects by sets of feature (orattribute)-value pairs, called signs.
The valuesof these signs may be atomic, variables or fur-ther sets feature-value pairs.
They can thereforebe represented as directed acyclic graphs or asattribute-value matrices using the PATR-II nota-tion of \[Shieber 86\].
The notion of unification isthen used to combine these.The main features used in the signs are OR-THOGRAPHY, CAT (the categorial grammar syn-tax), OItDER (the directionality of the "slash",which specifies linear ordering), FEATS (a setof syntactic features), CASES (a case-assignmentmechanism built on top of standard UCG), andSEM, a unification-based semantics with a neo-Davidsonian treatment of roles (\[Parsons 80,Dowty 89\]).
The semantics of an expression isof the form I:P, where l i s  a variable for the se-mantic index of the whole expression, and P is aconjunction of propositions in which that indexappears.
In addition, features called ARGO, ARG\]and so on provide useful "handles" for allowingthe bilingual lexicon to access the semantic in-dices, but they are not strictly necessary for thegrammarsThe signs presented are only shorthand abbrevi-ations of the full ones used, and the interestedreader is referred to \[Beaven 92\] for a more com-plete view.
The PATR-II notation will be used,with the Prolog convention that names startingwith upper case stand for variables.
In addi-tion, for the sake of clarity and brevity, the non-essential features will be omitted, as will be theirnames when these are are obvious.The grammar rules used subsume both functionalapplication and composition, but for the exam-ples given here, only functional application willbe necessary.An important feature of this approach is that thiswill make it possible to have an MT system inwhich no meaningful elements in the translationrelation are introduced syncategorematically (inthe form of transfer rules or operations with inter-lingual representations).
In particular, assumingwe have very rich lexicai entries (which containinformation about various dimensions of the lan-guage, such as orthography, syntax and seman-tics), all that is needed is a correspondence b -tween the lexieai entries, supplied by a bilinguallexicon, together with a set of constraints for eachcorrespondence.The design of such a translation system will there-fore involve three components: two monolinguallexicons for the languages concerned, and a bilin-gual lexicon.
The Spanish and English com-ponents were designed using purely monolingualconsiderations, and as a consequences the treat-ments of English and Spanish grammars are quitedifferent.The basics of the grammar will be explainedby presenting the monolingual lexical entries re-quired for the Spanish sentence Maria visit6Madrid, which corresponds to the English Maryvisited Madrid.
More linguistically interestingsentences will be offered at a later stage.2.1 The  Span ish  GrammarThe Spanish grammar is somewhat an unconven-tional version of UCG, in that VPs are treatedas sentences (S), and NPs as sentence modifiers(S/S in the eategorial notation).
The reasons forthis decision have to do with accounting for sub-ject pro-drop, and are discussed in \[Whitehick 88\]and \[\[leaven 92\].
A ease-assignment mechanismis added to standard UCG.
Amongst other uses,it provides a coverage of clitic placement.NPs are sentence modifiers.
The following one,for instance, looks for a sentence with semantics11: Seml, and returns another sentence, in whichthe semantics have been modified to state thatF3 (an index standing for Maria), plays a certain(unspecified) role in the semantics of 11.
The op-eration U stands for set union, and "all the propo-sitions in the semantics are interpreted here asbeing conjoined.

This is carried out by the case-assignmentmechanism, not shown here.
The following en-try for tim transitive verb will be derived fromthe base form and abstract tense morphemes ( eebelow).

The case-assignmentmechanism, which identifies the indices of theNPs, can be used to interact with the ORDER fea-ture if this is desired.
In tim above example, theonly thing that prevents the assignment of agentrole to Madrid and patient role to Maria are con-straints on the semantic types of the argumentsof the verb.

Inother words, each entry in the bilingual lexiconwill contain a pair of pointers to monolingual emtries in each of the languages translated.
Thesemonolingual entries are very rich signs, and thebilingual entries may add constraints for theirmonolingual signs to be in the translation rela-tion.
For instance, if a word has more than onetranslation depending on how various semanticfeatnres become instantiated, the bilinguM lexi-cal entries may express these restrictions.The bilingual exicon writer needs to be aware ofwhat the monolingual lexicons look like, in orderto encode the restrictions that the bilingual signimposes on the monollngual entries.
As long assome broad conventions are followed, this task be-comes very straightforward.
Most bilingual cor-respondences are very simple, and merely requiresome semantic indices in the monolingual signs tobe unified.
Provided these indices are made eas-ily available in predictable places of tile monolin-gum signs, the task of writing the correspondinglexical entries is very simple.
When some seman-tic constraints need to be put on these indices,again it is a straightforward task.
It is only onthe occasions when syntactic onstraints have tobe included that the monollnguM signs need tobe examined more closely, in order to determinehow that syntactic information is encoded.This results in a great modularity in the sys-tem.
Any monolingual component may easily bechanged, without affecting to any significant ex-tent the bilingual lexicon, and certainly not tilemonollngual components for any other language.At the same time, the simplicity of the bilingualcomponent makes it practicable to write multi-language systems, since all the hard work goesinto the monolingual lexicons which may be re-used for many language pairs, and the language-pair-specific information is concisely kept in thebilingual exicon.The following examples represent entries in thebilingual exicon.
Such an entry consists of point-ers to monolingual signs (for instance, (9) pntssigns (1) and (6)into correspondence), togetherwith constraints about the semantic indices con-talned in these signs.
Thus example (9) identifies(9)(10)\[AnG0 ESPANISH \ [~ \[AItG1 X\] L An?2ENGI~ISlI \ [~  IhnG1LARG2(The above is not exactly the entry as it appearsill the billngnai lexicon, since correspondences be-tween morphemes are used, but it clarifies theexposition).
(11)SPANISII ~ \[;EM \[AnGO F3Ill this very simple example, there was a one-to-one correspondence b tween monolinguM en-tries.
More generally, tile hilinguM lexicon willencode correspondences between sets of nlono-lingual entries, with appropriate constraints onthem (which allows us to enter idioms in thebilingual lexicon).
Most of the time these willbe singletons, but they may occasiomflly containseveral elements or indeed one of them may beempty (if a word in one language corresponds tothe empty string in the other, as will sometimesoccur with function words).3 Shake-and-BakeA new algorithm for generation, developcd byPete Whitelock and Mike Reape, and known asShake-and-Bake is presented (see \[Whitelock92\] for further discussion).
It can be outlined asfollows: first of all the SL expression is parsedusing the SL (monolingual) grammar.
After theparse is complete the variables in the semanticindices are Skolemised, and lexical entries arelooked up in the bilingual lexicon and replacedwith their TL equivalents.
Generation then takesplace starting from the bag of TL lexical entries,which have their semantic indices instantiated asa result of the parsing and look-up process.Two well-known parsing algorithms (shift-reduceand CKY) have been adapted to do this kind ofACTES DE COLING-92, NANTEs, 23-28 AO~" 1992 6 0 6 PROC.

1992generation instead.
Generation in tiffs contextcan be seen ms a variation of parsing, in which welet ttm syntactic onstraints instantiate the wordorder rather than letting the word order drive theparsing process.The CKY parsing algorithm may be eharacteriseda~ follows: it uses a chart or table where allwell-formed substrings (WFSs) that are found arerecorded, together with their position (i.e.
thewords that they span in the string).
The ta-ble is initialised with tile n words of the inputstring.
The algorithm builds parses by tindingthe shorter WFSs before the longer ones.
For allintegers j between 2 attd n, it records all WFSsof length j by looking for two adjacent strings oflength k and j - k recorded on the table.
If theymay combine hy means of a grammar rule, theresult is recorded on the table.The algorithm may be modified for generatingstrings from a bag of lexical entries.
The tablehere no longer records the position of WFSs, butjust the WFSs with the set of entries from thebag that they are made from.
It is initialisedby recording first all the well-formed strings oflength 1 (the lexieal entries).
Then, for all inte-gers j from 2 to n (the cardinality of the bag),it looks for two disjoint WFSs of length k andj - k recorded in the table.
If they combine bymeans of an (unordered) grammar rule, the re-sulting string (with orthography specified hy thedirection of the combination) is recorded on thetable, together with the set of entries it involves(the union of the sets of the two components):Starting from the bag of TL signs above, this al-gorithm would first put the verb and object to-gether into a component, and then combine theresult of that with the subject of the sentence.Linear ordering is determined hy tile TL gram-mar and the fact that the semantic indices a~'einstantiated by the tinm generation takes place.4 Morphology and Further ex-amplesFinally we shall see how Shake-and-Bake handlesmore interesting examples, in particular those in-volving argument switching and head switching.Entries for verbs such as the ones shown aboveare derived from the base forms and single mor-phemes.
\]~br instance, visitedis derived from mor-phemes for visit, 3sg and past.
A similar thing isclone for Spanish, and the bilingual lexicon ac-tually puts into correspondence the hase formsand the separate morphemes.
Correspondencesbetween morphemes will be used from here on.4.1 Argument  sw i tch ingArgument switching, such as John likes Mary,which translates into Spanish as Maria gusta aJuan (literally Mary pleases John can be coveredin a very simple manner.

They were written inde-pendently, and with purely monolingual consid-erations in mind, which led to some noticeabledifferences in the grammar design.
The monolimgual components were put into correspondence bymeans of a bilingual lexicon, and algorithms forparsing, doing bilingual lookup and generationwere suggested, which together constitute whathas been named Shake-and-Bake  Trans lat ion.While the process of Shake and Bake generationitself is NP-complete, it is likely that average casecomplexity may be reasonable (\[Brew 92\]).
Inthis sense, Shake and Bake may address issuesraised by the Landsbergen's subset problem, sinceinference in an interlingua may not even be de-cidable.References\[Alshawi et al 91\] Alshawi, It., Carter, D., Ray-AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOtTrl" 1992 6 0 8 PaGe.
