It relies on the enrichment of morpho-syntactic rules and the addition of fbur booleansyntactico-semantic features to a set of 1.,(}23words.
It results in a significant enhancementof precision of 30% with a slight decrease in re-call of 10%.1 Overv iewThe recognition ,of paraphrases and variants isan important issue in several areas of infornm-tion retrieval and text mlderstanding.
Mergingparaphrastic sentences ilnproves ummarizationby avoiding redundancy (Barzilay et al, 1999).Term variant conilation enhances recall in in-tbrmation retrieval by pointing at documentsthat contain linguistic variants of (tuery terms(Arampatzis et al, 1998).In (Jacquemin and Tzoukermann, 1999), atechnique is proposed for the conflation ofmorpho-syntactic variants that relies solely onmorphological and low-level syntactic features(part-of-speech category, munber agreement,morphological relationships, and phrase struc-ture).
An analysis of these results shows thelimitation of this approach: correct and incor-rect variants cannot be separated satisfactorilyon a purely morpho-syntactic basis.
Sonic addi-tional lexical semantics must be taken into con-sideration.In this study we propose a reasonably sim-ple, domain-independent, large-scale approachof lexical semantics to noun-to-verb variantrecognition.
It relies on the mere addition oftwo t)oolean syntactic features to 449 verbs andtwo boolean morpho-semantic features to 574nouns.
It result,; in a significant enhancementof precision of 30% with a slight decrease in re-call of 10%.
This new al)proaeh to semantics--human-based, ettlcient, involving simple linguis-tic tbatures --convincingly illustrates the posi-tive role of linguistic knowledge in informationprocessing.
It confirms that verbs and their se-mantics play a significant role in document anal-ysis (Klavans and Kan, 1998).2 Morpho-syntactic Approach toNomino-verba l  Var ia t ionIn order to illustrate the contribution of se-mantics to the detection of paraphrastic struc-tures, we focus on a specific type of wtriation:the vo.rl)al varbmts of Noun-Preposition-Nounterms o1" compounds in French.
For example,les corttraintes rdsiduellcs darts les coques sontanaIysdes (the residual constraints in the shells~re mialyzed) is such a vert)al variant of analysede corttraintc (constraint analysis).As a baseline tbr the extr~mtion of these vari-ants, we use a set of five morpho-syntactic rans-tbrmations fbr Noun-Preposition-Noun termsreported in (Jacquemin and Tzoukernlann,1999) (see Table 1).
1 We use the no-tation Ad(Ni)v for |;tie inorphological inkbetween the initial term and the trans-ibrmed structure.
It rel)resents any verbin the same morphological fanfily as Ni.For instance, in English, and accordingto the CELEX database, Ad(analysis)v ={to analyze, to psychoanalyze}.Given a NI P2 N8 structure, these transt'ornm-tions are obtained through corpus-based tuning1The following symbols are used for syntactic ate-gories: N (nouI0, A (adjective), Av (adverb), V (verb), C(coordinating conjunction), P (pret}osition), and D (de-tcrminer).
In the regular exl}ressions, ?
denotes option-ality and I disjunction.

Se(:ondly, by dell1>ing morpho-syntacti(: pa|;te.rns of variation inI;erms of l)art-of-sl)eech strings that are allowedto come in 1)e.tween these t;wo COlll;eltt words.Yet, the sequences found on su(;h a morl)ho-synl;acti(: basis prove to 1)e of wtrying qualityregarding their at/ility to t)rovide t)arat)hrasesof the initial l;erm.
Consider for instance someof l;he vm:imlts del, eeted for the term comparai-son de rds'ultat (comparison of results), in whichonly t;11(; \[irst; |;we sequences are good variants:compare les rdsultats ((:onlpare the results)(rule Nhead~lbV, pattern A4 (N1)vDNa)r&ultats ezpdrirnc.ntauz sent compar& (exI)er-imental results are compared) (rule Nhead-toVRev, 1)atte.rn NaAVA4 (N~)v)com, pard.s a'ux 'rds'.,ltats (COmlmred tothe results) (rule NheadToV, patternJt4(N1)vPN:{)rds'ultd d"unc eomparaison (resulted from ;tcomparison) (rule NModiiToVRev, patternJ~d (Na)vPDN1 )Such examples show that morpho-syntactiepatterns ;~re 1;oo coarse-gr~tined to ensure l;hatthe dependency relation between the two piv-ots (results is the object of the prediea?e com-parison) is maintained.
When trying to detinelinguistic criteria to ewfluate such w~riants, it;apt)ears that the frontier between good and loadvariants lies between those that preserve the ar-gument relation 1)etween the two content wordsand those that disrupt it.
This means that, inthe verbal wtriant, the.
argument relation be-tween the verb and l;he noun must be l;he sameas t;he relal;io11 between the deverl)al lOUll addthe othe.r noun in the nominal term.None of the five rules ensures that the subcat-egorization frame is preserved.
For instance, ifwe consider t;11o rule NModifI'oVl{ev, we find se-265quences that obey this constraint and sequencesthat violate it2:cr'itdrc d'&aluation (evaluation criterion) -+dvalv, dselon les crit~r'cs (evahmted according tothe criteria)syst~me d'dvaluation (evaluation system) *--+dvaht6 lc syst&ne (evaluated the system)In the second case, the transtbrmation is un-acceptable because the instrumental relation ex-pressed in the nonfinal term becomes an ob-ject relation in the verbal sequence.
Evenwhen word order is preserved, the relation be-tween the pivots can be totally different in theterm and its transformation, as i.u: contrgIed'installation (installation control) and contrgleccntralisd installd (installed centralized control)(rule NModitToV2).Our aim was to tbrmulate additional con-straints in order to control argument structurepreservation.
We thus had to cope with prob-lem of handling nonfinal t)hrases (NP) in whichone of the elements is morphologically inked toa verb.
In French, as in English, the seman-tics of these nominal phrases is an issue tbr lin-guistic description: the two nouns can be linkedby the whole range of argmnent-predicate rela-tions, and very few linguistic elements can beused to decide what relation is expressed.
Hereis a brief list of the configurations that are likelyto appear in such NPs:- the second noun is the object of the first; one:comparaison de rdsultat (comparison of result)- the second noun is the subject of the firstone: augmentation de I'intcv, sitd (increase in in-tensity)- the second noun is an adjunct: tr'aitcment gla chaleur (treating with heat)the first noun is an adjunct: tauxd'augmentation (increase rate)Our aim was to find a way to use surface lin-guistic knowledge, as required in such an areaof NLP, to deal with the interpretation of thesephrases.4 Light Semant ics  forNomino-verba l  Variat ionsOur approach consisted of two steps: firstly,defining semantic lues tbr accepting or discard-sin what follows~ the symbols --~ and *----> respectivelyindicate correct and incorrect ransformationsing variants and, secondly, defining new varia-tion patterns based oll these features.4.1 F i l ter ing  Cr i te r iaFirst, using linguistic results on the semanticsof French NPs (Fabre, 1996; Bartning, 1990),we identified predicate-argument configurationsthat cannot be matched by a given pattern ('re-ject' heuristics in the sense of (Lapata, 1999)).For example, when rule NmodifToVRev applies,N1 de N3 terms cannot be i)araphrased by ver-bal sequences in which N1 is the ol)ject of theverb, as in: ezp&iencc d'utilisation (experimentof use) *-+ utilisait 'uric ezpdrier~,cc (used an ex-periment).
In such a configuration, only non--thematic arguments (adjuncts) of the deverbalnoun may be tbund inside the NP.Similarly, when rule NheadToVRev applies,N\] de N3 terms cannot be paraphrased by ver-bal sequences in which N\] is the subject of atransitive verb, as in: utilisation de l'ezp&'icnce(use of experiment) *-+ czpdriencc utilisant (ex-t)eriment using).This configuration provides variants onlywhen the verb is intransitive or ergative: erga-tive verbs allow tbr alternations of the tbrm: NPV (la dcnsitd au.qrncntc) / one V NP (on awl-monte la dcnsitd).In this case, the tbllowing transtbrmation iscorrect: augmentation de densitd (density in-crease) / de,,,,s'itd av,9'mentc (density increases).4.2 Enriched MetarulesOnce it has 1)een established wtfich transforma-tions should be rejected, we searched tbr sur-face linguistic clues that could help us to fil-ter out these undesirable variants.
It led us tothe redefinition of the metarules, in two ways:putting additional constraints on the part-ofspeech strings that can intervene between thetwo pivots, and defining new features to add lin-guistic control upon the application of the rules.These t~atures are: the prepositional form, themorphological type of the noun, the transitivityof the verb, and the voice (active versus pas-sive).Here are two examples tbr the redefinition ofthe metarules (fllrther details and examples aregiven in table 3):ru le Nmodi fToVRev In this case, themetarule is transtbrmed into a single26617elilled rule, in whi('h the ('oml)ilm|:ionof parts of sl)eech is mot(; res|;riel;ed: apreposition is required to elinfinate objectrein|ions from the verbal phrase.

The problem of linguistic vari-at ion in information processing forces the lin-guist to reconsider parat)hrase and trm~sf'orma-tion mechanisms in a new perspective, basedon real l inguistic data  and on systematic ort)usexploration.
The  paraphrase judgment  is eval-uated in a new way, from a practical point ofview: two sequences are said to be a paraphraseof each other if the user of an information sys-tem considers that  they bring identical or sin>ilar informat ion content.
Regarding linguisticmethodology, this work led us to find "l ight" so-lutions in terms of lexical encoding to describecomplex semantic t)henomena.
This approach ispronfising because it demonstrates that  linguis-tic knowledge can really enhance the results ofterm recognit ion beyond the ,norphology level,and that  semantics can be taken into accountto sonm extent.ReferencesA.
