SGS: A SYSTEM FOR MECHANICAL GENERATION OF JAPANESE SENTENCESTaisuke SatoElectrotechnical LaboratoryIbaraki, JapanSGS is a compact sentence generationsystem.
Inputs are the frames and spe-cifications of a sentence.
Programs attached tocontext free rules carry out the generationtask.
Output is a surface sentence with anassociated derivation tree.suitable laws for a computer from lingisticphenomena.
Therefore, this paper firstdescribes the overall organization of SGS,secondly explains the linguistic structure ofJapanese with which SGS.
tries to deal, andlastly gives examples of sentence generation.IntroductionA sentence genration process can be a con-sidered to be a process starting from non-linearmeaning structures and ending in a linear struc-ture, i.e.
a sentence.
Because meaning struc-tures reflect the speaker's intension and aspeaker can easily produce a sentence realizinghis intension, one tends to think of sentencegeneration as an easy task.Famous AI systems including SHRDLU, oftenadopt a fill-in-the-blank method to generate an-swering sentences.
Efforts are concentrated onother tasks, such as sentence understanding,planning, deduction, and so on.Although study of sentence generation hasnot been receiving much attention, it is valua-ble for the following reasons:i) to develope a tool which enables a user tounderstand what has been understood by an in-telligent system.2) to build a machine translation system.3) to develop a theory of knowledgerepresentation.
If some formalism of knowledgerepresentation is to be valid, it must bereadable.
In other words, it must be easilytransformed into sentences.
And this readablityis checked by means of sentence generation.4) to verify correctness of the various lin-guistic theories from a computational linguisticpoint of view.SGS is an experimental sentence generationsystem, the inputs of which are frames repre-senting some meaning.
It generates a Japanesesentence with the help of a user-supplieddictionary and grammar.
The generation processof the SGS is top-down with backtracking.
Theresult is a surface sentence with its derivationtree.
This system does not generate sentencesat random but carefully generate one sentenceobeying the user's control information which isgiven in advance of the generation process.In computational study of sentence genera-tion, building a system is one facet of thestudy.
The other facet is the extraction ofSystem OrganizationSGS is written in ETL-LISP and consists ofabout i000 line source statements.
To actuallyproduce a sentence, it needs three kinds of in-put, a dictionary, and a grammar.
Accounts aregiven in order.InputsA sentence generation corresponds to thespeaker's speech process.
Accordingly, if asentence of good quality is needed, many factorsof a speaker should be incorporated.
However werestrict ourselves to treating only the syntac-tic and semantic factors.
The pragmatic factorsremained as future problems.Conceptually, factors considered here areseparated into two categories.
One is the fac-tors governing the intra-sentenceal phenomena,which determines the cognitive meaning of a sen-tence, and is stated in terms of phrase struc-tures, transformation, various features and thelike.
Inputs belonging to this category are theframes representing cognitive meaning of thesententence to be generated, and the syntacticcategory (e.g.
SS ---Simple Sentence) of thesentence.
In this paper, frames in examples aresupplied by the Japanese language understandingsystem EXPLUS.
14The other cateogry is factors governinginter-sentencial phenomena related to "topic andcomments", such as the distinction between "waand ga" e.t.c..
These factors reflect aspeaker's views.
They can be treated by speci-fying the arrangement of noun phrases or thesurface subject of the sentence.
For example,if one wants to put emphasis on a certain nounwhose deep case is THEME, specifying (S-SUBJ =THEME) may compel the system to derive a passivesentence whose surface subject is the specifiednoun.
Therefore, such specifications work asconditions on the sentence or control informa-tion for the generative process.In summary, frames, a syntactic category,and conditions on a sentence reflecting aspeaker's views comprise the inputs of SGS.Given these inputs, SGS tries to generate asentence of the specified syntactic categoryfrom the frames by considering the given21--conditions.Figure 1 is an example of an input frame.This frame represents the fact that HANAKO BUYSA BOOK.
The REL-TM slot designates relative-time relation to other facts.
The SF slot des-ignates semantic features of the predicate KAW-D(BUY).
CACT(causal actant), THEME are the deepcases of KAW-U.

Example of Frame.GrammarGrammar in SGS refers to the collection ofcontext free rules augmented by LISP programs.The role of the grammar is to systematicallyconvert input frames into small trees, then com-bine and transform them while making sure of thegrammatical correctness of the generated trees.It is not necessary for tree structures toaccompany sentence generation(McDonald's systemdoesn't use tree structures), but setence gener-ation via tree structures has many advantages.First of all, lingistic knowledge based ontransformational theory can be easily imple-mented in a computer.
Linguistic concepts suchas subject, object, scope of quantifier, de-letfon, raising, e.t.c., are all related to treestructure.
Also, organizing the system as atree manipulation system is a good way to keepits clarity and is helpful in debugging thegrammar.
Suggestive information to improvegrammar could be obtained by tracing inter-mediate trees.
Moreover, context free rules toconstruct a derivation tree assures, to some ex-tent, the grammatical correctness of the gener-ated sentence.
The form of a syntactic rule is:(<category> <descendents> <Pl> <P2>)A rule has four fields.
<category> and<descendents> form a context free rule:<category>=> <descendents>.<PI> is a LISP program.
It is applied tothe frames which should be realized as asentence of the <cateogry>.
It divides theframes into subframes corresponding to each<descendents> considering the attachedconditions.<P2> is also a LISP program.
It is invokedafter the completion of <descendents> subtrees.Its role is to look at the subtrees and makesure of their grammatical correctness.
Trans-formation is added to the subtrees as necessary.Finally, <P2> returns a partial derivation treewhose top node is <category>.
The rule invoca-tion mechanism is explained later.DictionaryA lexical item in dictionary describes theknowledge of each word.
As for the predicate, aname, a surface expression, semantic features,deep cases and their semantic features are in-cluded in its description.
Similar items areincluded in the noun's frame.
The form of anitem is:(<name> <category> <Pi> <unit>)<name> and <category> are keys forsearching the dictionary.
In the case of HON (abook), the <name> is HON, the <category> isnoun.<Pi> is a LISP program to check conditionsfor lexical insertion.<unit> is a frame depicting linguisticknowledge of a word.
World knowledge can alsobe stored in <unit>.The description of a lexical item is at aconcrete level.
Neither lexical decompositionnor word description by primitives is adopded.Although, with respect to verbs, Japanese has arather systemic way of deriving new words from abasic word (for example, from TOB-U (to fly),TOB-ASU (to make something fly) or TOB-ERU (canfly) are derived.
), studies in relations amongthe lexical items seems not to be advancedenough for use in a computer at present.Generation mechanismThere are many methods to generatesentences.
The fill-in-the-blank method iseasiest.
McDonald's system ~'9 derives a sentencedirectly from source data.
BABEL ~'s derives asentence indirectly using discrimination netsand a syntax net.As stated previously, SGS generate asentence via tree structures.
Initially, SGSreceives an orderd triple from a user.
Its formis:<category, input-frames, conditions on the sen-tence>The system regards the orderd triple as agoal.
It says "from the input-frames, generatea sentence of the category that satisfies theconditions".
After pushing this triple to thebottom of the stack, the system starts thegeneration process described below.step i: lexical insertionLook at the top of the stack.
Let thistriple be category A, frame Fr-A, conditionCond-A .
Collect lexical items from the dic-tionary that match Fr-A and satisfy Cond-A.If no item is found, Go to step 2.
Else,choose one of the items and return it.Because back-track may occur in later process,preserve the unchosen items.
Remove the topelement from the stack.
Go to step 1.22step 2: subgoal expansion downwardIf subtrees under category A are com-pleted, go to step 3.
Else collect rules ofthe form A descendents P1 P2 from thegrammar.
Select one of them.
Suppose theselected one is <A (B C) Pl P2>.
Executeprogram Pl to create the subgoals, P1 triesto divide Fr-A into Fr-B and Fr-C. Pl alsoconverts Cond-A to Cond-B and Cond-Crespectively.
If this division is successful,push the resulting subgoals <B Fr-B Cond-B>and <C Fr-C Cond-C> onto the stack.
Go tostep i.
If division is unsuccessful, tryanother rule.
If all the tried rules fail,start back-tracking.step 3: tree building upwardThis stop treats the case where subtreesunder category A are completed.
Executeprogram P2 in the rule <A descendents Pl P2>which was used to divide Fr-A at step 2.
P2tries to confirm the grammatical correctnessof the completed subtrees using interpretationof them.
If one of them is found to beungrammartical, start back-tracklng.
Elsetransform them as necessary and provide datafor later interpretation of the completedtree.
Combine the category A and subtrees tocomplete the partial derivation tree cor-respoinding to the goal <A, Fr-A, Cond-A> onthe top of the stack.
Remove this triple fromthe stack.
If the stack is empty, collect theterminals of the tree in left-to-right order,give morphological inflection to the sequenceof terminals and print them.
Otherwise, go tostep i.Categor U ACond-AI FP-A Istep I .

Ja?aneseThe first part, A, expresses epistemicmoaning of the sentence.
It begins with severalpropositional phrases (typically two or three)in unspecified order.
A prepositional phrase isderived by the rule <PP ~> <NP><P>, where <NP>is a noun phrase, and <P> is a post positionalparticle Particles belonging to <P> are GA, NO,NI, WO, DE, etc..
They work as surface casemarkers.After a sequence of <PP>s, there comes averb, an adjective, or nothing.
A verb can befollowed by SERU'SASERU (causative particles) orRERU RARERU (particles of passive or spontaneityetc.).
These particles are connected to a verbso tightly that thay work as a single word.Words for <ASPECT>, TE-MIRU(to try), TE-AGERU(to indicate a speaker's attitude to the hearerin which a speaker kindly does something for thehearer), TE-KURERU(opposite to TE-AGERU), etc.are the last constituents of part A.
These areall verbs.The second part, B, indicates a speaker'sattitude to.
the proposition expressed by part A.This part contains DA(affirmative),NAI(negative), DAROU(guess), RASII(conjecture),etc..
These are all particles.Expressions in the last part, C, are meantto cause some effect on the hearer.
Among themare KA(interogative), NA(prohibition),NE(suggestion), RO(imperative), etc..A predicate(verb, adjective) has a casestructure.
For example, OK-U (put) has threecases: CACT(causal actant), THEME, and LOCUS.Each case is accompanied by specific particles.CACT and GA, THEME and WO, LOCUS and NI or DEare usually used in pairs.
The case system is abasic linguistic structure in itself, but theprimary objective of SGS is not the study ofcase system in Japanese, so SGS utilizes thecase system of EXPLUS.Syntactic rules governing the connection ofparticles following a predicate are said to bedescribed by a regular grammar.As for tense representation, TA is used toindicate the past or perfect tense.
TA can beinserted between either part A and part B, or23-part B and tense systems are discussed in thefollowing sections.A compound sentence is composed of simplesentences.
A relative clause in Japanese isderived by the rule <NP> ~<S><NP>.
This ruleyields a left branching structure peculiar toJapanese in centrast to English.
In this paperan example of a sentence using a relative clauseis shown with discussions.
However, sentenceswith coordinate structures are not treated.From a transformational stand point, em-bedding structures are important.
A causativeor passive sentence is typical of embeddedstructures.
A generation example of a causativepassive sentence is shown later.
But how a pas-sive and causative sentence is derived from theinitial structure is not definitely solved.Aspect z,2In order to achieve temporal represen-tation, treatment of tense and aspect isinevitable.
First we discuss the Japaneseaspect system which brings a lot of insightsuseful to computational linguistics.The basic role of aspectual representationis the distinction between perfect andnon-perfect.
It seems to be common to manylanguages.
However, actual languages providemechanisms for aspectual representation de-veloped beyond this distinction.In Japanese, many types of aspects arerealized by using aspectual particles followinga verb.
TE-IRU and TE-SIMAU are most typical.For instance, YON-DE-IRU (YON is a contractedform of the verb YOM-U (to read)) means therepeat  o f  read ing  or  the  exper ience  o f  read ing .YON-DE-S IMAT-TE- IRU means  be ing  in the  s ta tea f te r  the  ach ievement  o f  read ing .

Cte~sif icatton o~ Rspects and Predica~esThere are stative, inchoative, completive,and other aspects.
The stative aspect is sub-classified into three subclasses.
TE-IRU per-forms an important role in establishing thesesubclasses.Verbs in Japanese are classified accordingto the aspectual meaning of the combination ofthe verb and aspectual particles.
As a result,aspect features are assigned to a predicate andan aspectual particle.
For example, \[-durative,+resultive\] is assigned to OK-U.
\[+stative,+durative\] is assigned to an adjective or acupulative expression DA, and so on.
Withregard to particles, \[+stative\], \[+completive\]are assigned to TE-IRU and TE-SIMAUrespectively.Once aspect features are assigned to thepredicate and the particles, an interpretationof the aspect of a composite predicate ismechanically deduced by looking only at theaspect features of each consistuent.
The aspectof YON-DE-IRU, for example, is obtained in sucha way that the aspect features of YON-U(read)and TE-IRU are examined first.
YOM-U has\[-stative, +durative, +resultative\] and TE-IRUhas \[+stative\].
Then the features are syn-thesized in obedience to 'synthesizing rules ofaspects' In this case the result is\[+durative, +resultative, +stative\].
It allowstwe interpretations, which is compatible withthe aspectual ambiguity of YON-DE-IRU.
Oneinterpretation, based on the combination\[+durative, +stative\], is the progressiveinterpretation---being in the state of reading.The other interpretation, based on \[+re-sultative, +stative\], is the experiencinginterpretation--- being in the state of afterreading.
These aspectual ambiguities areresolved by context or adverbials.
Similarly,the aspect of YON-DE-SIMAT-TE-IRU is obtained inthe same way.It is easy to see the advantage of 'aspectdescription by aspect features'.
It enalbles usto treat the (Japanese) aspect mechanically inboth directions -- sentence understanding andsentence generation.
However, though a greatdeal of progress has been made in the study ofJapanese aspects, we have not yet devised asatisfactory system for aspect description byaspect features.Tense  i,aIt is well known that TA stands for notonly past tense but also the speaker's confir-mation, recollection, or immediate requirement.Consequently, we can not simply say that TAindicates past tense.
Instead there are anumber of evidences suggesting that TA indicatesthe perfect as well.
As will be explained inthe following, treating TA as a perfect-indicator leads to a succsinct description oftense interpretation in Japanese.
This fact it-self, in the author's opinion, is the strongestevidence for TA as a perfect-indicator.\[+perfect\], therefore, is assigned to TA.
It isalso assigned to a predicate accompanying TA.If a predicate does not accompany TA, \[-perfect\]is assigned.
Some definitions are needed beforestating tense interpretation in Japanese.Definition: speech time is the time when aspeaker speaks, and event time is the timeoccupied by the events(facts) refered to by asentence  or  a c lause .With this definition, the principle of tense in-terpretation in Japanese is stated as follows.--24 -?
A sentence of a clause containing apredicate of +perfect(-perfect) refers to theevents or facts previous(not previous) to thestandard time.The standard time of a simple sentence ora main clause is the speech time.
Thestandard time of a subordicate clause is theevent time refered to by the main clause.In short, TA asserts something has occuredpreviously.
Detailed tense interpretation usingthe aspect feature 'stative' is summarized infigure Fig.
5 which is hereafter called 'theprinciple '.m l m a l  ?

Pr inc ip le  of Tense In terpretat ionThe principle is applicable to any simplesentence and the majority of complex sentences.However some complex sentence has exceptionaltense interpretation.
Consider the next sen-tence in which the conjunctive TOKI is used.KAKI-WO TABE-TA TOKI KANE-GA NAT-TA.
(a persimmon) (ate) (a bell) (rang)When I ate a persimmon, a bell rang.According to the principle, TA of TABE-TAassures that eating-a-persimmon preceds bell-ringing.
But, unfortunately, such is not thecase.
The fact implied by the sentence is thesimultaneity of eating-a-persimmon andbell-ringing.Such an exception may be ascribed to thepeculiarity of the conjunctive TOKI.
Since TOKIis also a noun and means time.
TOKI used as aconjunctive is apt to connote 'at the itmewhen'.
Exceptions to tense interpreation seemto depend on the conjunctive in the case of anadverbial clause, or the head noun in the caseof a relative clause.
Therefore case studies oftense interpretation are needed.Tense interpretation of the sentence typeSI-- conj --$2 concerning Japanese tense con-junctives rOKI(when), MAE(before), ATe(after) issummarized in Fig.
6.S1 is a subordinate clause.
$2 is a mainclause.
The aspect feature +-stative is a fea-ture belonging to the predicate of $2.
'ap-plicable' means that the principle isapplicable.
'simultaneous' means that the tenseinterpretiation is exceptional and the simul-taneity of the events refered to by S1 and 82.In the case of relative clauses, a tenseinterpretation table like the above can besimilarly constructed, but the situation isworse in the case of adverbial clauses.

(TAROU--name)(ate)(a cake)(HANAKO--name)(made)The cake that TAROU ate was made by HANAKO.The main clauses is HANAKO-GA TUKUT-TA(HANAKO made a cake).
The relative clause isTAROU-GA TABE-TA(TAROU ate the cake).
Bothclauses include TA, so the prediction by theprinciple is that the event TAROU-GA TABE-TApreceds the event HANAKO-GA TUKUT-TA, which isexactly opposite to usual tense interpretation.Because of these difficulties, SGS did notgo far with respect to aspect and tenseinterpretation.
Obviously further investigationfrom a linguistic point of view is needed formechanical aspect-tense interpretation.Generation ExamplesRelative ClauseThere are two types of relative clause.One is the TAROU-GA TABE-TA KEIKI(the cake whichTAROU ate) type.
The other is the TAROU-GAKEIKI-WO TABE-TA ZIZITU(the fact that TAROU atea cake) type.The example shown is the former type.Meaning structures consist of two propositionalframes P0000Ol and P000002.
Note that they havea common filler (NO00002.1TA).Initially specified are the top categorySS, the arrangement of propositional phrases--first THEME then LOCUS, and the surface subject--THEME.
These inputs are goals saying"generate a sentence from the frames shown infigure 7.
As to the sentence, its category mustbe SS(simple sentence), its surface subject mustbe THEME--ITA(a board), and THEME must be to theleft of LOCUS".On receiving these inputs, the systemstarts rule invocations.
The invoked rule-25selects a frame suitable for a main clause.Priority of the selection is given to the framewhich includes a REL-TM(relative time) slotfilled with "HATUWA"(speech time).
In thisexample, P000001 is selected.
It states thatTAROU-GA ITA-WO TATEKAKE-RU(TAROU leaned a boardsomewhere).
P000001 being selected, the systemcontinues invoking rules in order to translateP000001 into a main clause.During the course of rule invocations, thegeneration process reaches the stage where theTHEME slot is treated.
Because the THEME slotand its filler--(NO00002.ITA), are always sup-posed to correspond to a noun phrase, rules ofthe form <NP>~>... are invoked one by one.As (N000002/ITA) is shared with anotherframe, P000002, which states that HANAKO-GA ITA-WO OI-TA(HANAKO put a board), <NP>-~<SS><NP>, arule for a relative clause, eventually isinvoked.
It produces a relative clause--HANAKO-GA OI-TA ITA(a board which HANAKO put(eMT~--((IDENT ?

It first builds a tree for thesentence HANAKO-GA ITA-WO OI-TA from P000002 andcompletes the realtive clause by moving theposition of ITA to the end of the sentence.Generally speaking, complex noun phrase re-strictions should be considered, but they do notwork here.
After the completion of the relativeclause concerning (N000002.ITA) with a corre-sponding derivation tree, SGS tries to completethe main clause, but, since the rule invoked forthe main clause allows only CACT--TAROU as asurface subject, it can not satisfy one of theinitial goals (S-SUBJ = THEME).
So backtrackoccurs .Finally, the alternative rule<SK>=><SK><RAREi> is invoked.
It generates apassive sentence whose subject is THEME--ITA,and the rest of the specifications are alsosatisfied.
'-*-' in the derivation tree in-dicates a non-exsistent filler of the obligatorycase in the given frame.A passive sentence treatedby SGS is 'a pure passive sen-tence' which does have a counterpart in English.
There is alsoanother type called 'anadversitive passive sentence'.This type is too subtle to treatmechanically.
Therefore we con-sider only pure passive sentenceand the rules for them.Causative Passive SentenceJapanese causative sen-tences, which are identified bythe occurence of VERB + SERU.SASERU, often admit two types ofinterpretation.

Causative Passive Sentence.TAROU-GA HANAKO-WO YUKA-SERU.
(to go)= THEME)--initial goal--After the com-pletion of the deri-vation tree and the(embedded) sentencecorresponding toP000068, the rulementioned above noticesthe tense of P000068 asbeing +perfect.
Thisfeatre would entail anoccurence of TA infront of SASERU on thesurface level.
Butword order such as...TA SASERU... isungrammatical so TA issupressed.A causative sen-tence corresponding toP000067 is built byraising CACT of theembedded sentence.
Theraised CACT--HANAKOchanges to THEME.
Theresulting treestructure is, roughlyspeaking, \[-*- HANAKO\[HASIGO TATEKAKE-RU\]TA\].
The symbol -*-means non-exsistentfiller.Owing to thisstructure, a passivesentence whose subjectis THEME--HANAKO canbe derived and (S-SUBJis satisfied.One interpretation is that TAROU forcesHANAKO to go.
The other is that TAROU permitsHANAKO to go.
Ambiguities can be resolved byadverbials or context.
These ambiguities bringdifficulties to the treatment of causative sen-tences, but, for simplicity, SGS deals with onlythe former type.The example above is a causative-passivesentence.
User's specifications are of thecategory SS and (S-SUBJ = THEME).
The initialmeaning structures consist of two propositionalframes.
The generation process begins bychoosing a HATUWA frame to serve as an orign oftime relations in the given frames.
The chosenframe, P000067, includes a predicate slot con-taining SASERU.
It will produce a causativesentence.While SASERU is a causative particle, itbehaves as a verb in the deep level.
It is averb which takes a sentencial object whose caseis THEME.
Therefore the invoked rule responsi-ble for completing a causative sentencesearches for a sentencial object.
P000068 isthe frame for a sentencial object.
It states:HANAKO-GA HASIGO-WO TATEKAKE-TA.
(a ladder) (leaned)HANAKO leaned a ladder.ConclusionSentence generation is a basic task for anintelligent system, such as a consultant systemor a Q.A.
system, e.t.c.. SGS, though it is farfrom being satisfactory, is one step closer toan intelligent sentence generation system.
Thenext step should be manifold.
SGS admitsvarious improvements.During the generation process, diverse mes-sages are exchanged between invoked rules sothat messages tend to get out of control.Greater regulation is needed.As for the dictionary, it would be in-teresting to incorporate 'lexicaldecomposition'.
Introducing 'lexical decom-position' can be helpful in organizing lexicalitems in a dictionary.
However it requires amore refined method of lexical insertion.Linguistic knowledge should be thoroughlyinvestigated and digested.
Though the aspect-tense system in Japanese has been investigatedto some extent, it is not obvious whether thedescription of aspect-tense system by featuresis sufficient to represent temporal knowledge.Presently, SGS lacks the ability to con-tinuously produce sentences.
In order to form aparagraph the problem of coreference mechanism--2?--must be solved.
Japanese is so rich in ellipsisit is necessary to reveral and implement the el-lipsis system.ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: The auther is grateful toMr.
