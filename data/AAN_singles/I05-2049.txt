Statistical Machine Translation Part II: Tree-Based SMTDekai WUHuman Language Technology CenterHong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)Clear Water Bay, Hong Kongdekai@cs.ust.hkAbstractOne of the most active and promising areas ofstatistical machine translation (SMT) researchare tree-based SMT approaches.
Tree-basedSMT has the potential to overcome theweaknesses of early SMT architectures which (a)do not handle long-distance dependencies well,and (b) are underconstrained in that they allowtoo much flexibility in word reordering.In this tutorial, we will review the variouspossible approaches to tree-based SMT, rangingfrom the original Inversion TransductionGrammar (ITG) models to later models such asalignment templates, dependency models, tree-to-string models, tree-to-tree models, and alsoprobabilistic EBMT models.
We will discuss thetheoretical relationships between approaches,with critical analysis of their strengths andweaknesses.
Within this framework we willsurvey the emerging comparative results fromintriguing new large-scale empirical studiesacross various language pairs.
We will considerwhat kind of constraints and biases can orshould be imposed by models on the variationbetween unrelated human languages, and howthis can facilitate efficient algorithms for a widerange of tasks in machine learning andprocessing of language.
We will consider bothscientific and engineering implications, andinvestigate the potential relationships to cross-language universals.BiographyProf.
