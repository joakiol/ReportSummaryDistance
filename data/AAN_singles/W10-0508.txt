Therestill remain significant clusters of information accessneeds, however, where keyword matching is lesssuccessful.
One such instance is technical web fo-rums and mailing lists (collectively termed ?forums?for the purposes of this paper): technical forumsare a rich source of information when troubleshoot-ing, and it is often possible to resolve technicalqueries/problems via web-archived data.
The searchfacilities provided by forums and web search en-gines tend to be over-simplistic, however, and thereis a desperate need for more sophisticated search (Xiet al, 2004; Seo et al, 2009), including: favour-ing threads which have led to a successful resolu-tion; reflecting the degree of clarity/reproducibilityof the proposed solution in a given thread; repre-senting threads via their threaded rather than sim-ple chronological structure; the ability to highlightkey aspects of the thread, in terms of the problemdescription and solution which led to a successfulresolution; and ideally, the ability to represent theproblem and solution in normalised form via infor-mation extraction.This paper provides a brief outline of an attemptto achieve these and other goals in the context ofLinux web user forum data, in the form of the IL-IAD (Intelligent Linux Information Access by DataMining) project.
Linux users and developers relyparticularly heavily on web user forums and mail-ing lists, due to the nature of the community, whichis highly decentralised ?
with massive proliferationof packages and distributions?
and notoriously badat maintaining up-to-date documentation at a levelsuitable for newbie and even intermediate users.2 Project OutlineOur proposed solution is as follows: (1) crawl datafrom a variety of web user forums; (2) analyse eachthread, to identify named entities and generate meta-data; (3) analyse post-level linkages; (4) predictuser-level features which are expected to impinge onthe quality of search results; and finally (5) draw to-gether the features from (1) to (4) to enhance thequality of a traditional ranked IR approach.
Webriefly review each step below.
Given space limi-tations, we focus on outlining our interpretation ofthe task in this paper.
For further details and results,the reader is referred to the key papers cited herein.2.1 CrawlingThe first step is to crawl data from a variety of fo-rums and mailing lists, for which we have developedopen-source scraping software in the form of SITE-SCRAPER.1 SITESCRAPER is designed such that theuser simply copies relevant content from a browser-rendered version of a given set of pages, which itinterprets as a structured record, and translates intoa generalised XPATH query.2.2 Thread-level analysisNext, we perform named entity recognition (NER)over each thread to identify entities such as packageand distribution names, version numbers and snip-pets of code; as part of this, we perform version1http://sitescraper.googlecode.com/15anchoring, in identifying what entity each versionnumber relates to.To generate thread-level metadata, we classifyeach thread for the following three features, basedon an ordinal scale of 1?5 (Baldwin et al, 2007):Complete: Is the problem description complete?Solved: Is a solution provided in the thread?Task Oriented: Is the thread about a specificproblem?We additionally automatically classify the natureof the thread content, in terms of, e.g., whether itcontains documentation or installation details, or re-lates to software, hardware or programming.Our experiments on thread-level classification arebased on a set of 250 annotated threads from Lin-uxQuestions and other forums, as well as a datasetfrom CNET.2.3 Post-level analysisWe automatically analyse the post-to-post discoursestructure of each thread, in terms of which (preced-ing) post(s) each post relates to, and how, buildingoff the work of Rose?
et al (1995) and Wolf and Gib-son (2005).
For example, a given post may refutethe solution proposed in an earlier post, and alsopropose a novel solution in response to the initiat-ing post.Separately, we are developing techniques foridentifying whether a new post to a given forumis sufficiently similar to other (ideally resolved)threads that the author should be prompted to firstcheck the existing threads for redundancy before anew thread is initiated.Our experiments on post-level analysis are, onceagain, based on data from LinuxQuestions andCNET.2.4 User-level analysisWe are also experimenting with profiling users vari-ously, based on a 5-point ordinal scale across a rangeof user characteristics.
Our experiments are basedon data from LinuxQuestions (Lui, 2009).2.5 IR rankingThe various features are interfaced with an ad hocinformation retrieval (IR) system via a learning-to-rank approach (Cao et al, 2007).
In order to carryout IR evaluation, we have developed a set of queriesand relevance judgements over a large-scale set offorum data.Our experiments to date have been based on com-bination over three IR engines (LUCENE, ZETTAIRand LEMUR), and involved thread-level metadataonly, but we have achieved encouraging results, sug-gesting that thread-level metadata can enhance IReffectiveness.3 ConclusionsThis paper provides an outline of the ILIAD project,focusing on the tasks of crawling, thread-level anal-ysis, post-level analysis, user-level analysis and IRreranking.
We have designed a series of class setsfor the component tasks, and carried out experimen-tation over a range of data sources, achieving en-couraging results.AcknowledgementsNICTA is funded by the Australian Government as rep-resented by the Department of Broadband, Communica-tions and the Digital Economy and the Australian Re-search Council through the ICT Centre of Excellence pro-gram.ReferencesT Baldwin, D Martinez, and RB Penman.
