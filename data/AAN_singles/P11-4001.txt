Non-availability of lexicalresources, spelling variations in the sourcelanguage text, source text ambiguous words,named entity recognition and collocations arethe major challenges faced while developingthis syetm.
The key activities involved duringtranslation process are preprocessing,translation engine and post processing.
Lookupalgorithms, pattern matching algorithms etcformed the basis for solving these issues.
Thesystem accuracy has been evaluated usingintelligibility test, accuracy test and BLEUscore.
The hybrid syatem is found to performbetter than the constituent systems.Keywords: Machine Translation, ComputationalLinguistics, Natural Language Processing, Hindi,Punjabi.
Translate Hindi to Punjabi, Closelyrelated languages.1 IntroductionMachine Translation system is a softwaredesigned that essentially takes a text in onelanguage (called the source language), andtranslates it into another language (called thetarget language).
There are number ofapproaches for MT like Direct based,Transform based, Interlingua based, Statisticaletc.
But the choice of approach depends uponthe available resources and the kind oflanguages involved.
In general, if the twolanguages are structurally similar, in particularas regards lexical correspondences,morphology and word order, the case forabstract syntactic analysis seems lessconvincing.
Since the present research workdeals with a pair of closely related languagei.e.
Hindi-Punjabi , thus direct word-to-wordtranslation approach is the obvious choice.
Assome rule based approach has also been used,thus, Hybrid approach has been adopted fordeveloping the system.
An exhaustive surveyhas already been given for existing machinetranslations systems developed so farmentioning their accuracies and limitations.
(Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2009).2 System Architecture2.1 Pre Processing PhaseThe preprocessing stage is a collection ofoperations that are applied on input data tomake it processable by the translation engine.In the first phase of Machine Translationsystem, various activities incorporated includetext normalization, replacing collocations andreplacing proper nouns.2.2 Text NormalizationThe variety in the alphabet, different dialectsand influence of foreign languages has resultedin spelling variations of the same word.
Suchvariations sometimes can be treated as errors inwriting.
(Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2010).2.3 Replacing CollocationsAfter passing the input text through textnormalization, the text passes through thisCollocation replacement sub phase of Pre-processing phase.
Collocation is two or moreconsecutive words with a special behavior.
(Choueka :1988).
For example, the collocation???
????
(uttar prad?sh) if translated word toword, will be translated as ????
???
(jav?b r?j)but it must be translated as ????
?????
(uttarprad?sh).
The accuracy of the results forcollocation extraction using t-test is notaccurate and includes number of such bigramsand trigrams that are not actually collocations.Thus, manually such entries were removed andactual collocations were further extracted.

Thecollocation table of the database consists of5000 such entries.
In this sub phase, thenormalized input text is analyzed.
Eachcollocation in the database found in the inputtext will be replaced with the Punjabitranslation of the corresponding collocation.
Itis found that when tested on a corpuscontaining about 1,00,000 words, only 0.001%collocations were found and replaced duringthe translation.Hindi TextFigure 1 : Overview of Hindi-Punjabi Machine Translation System2.4 Replacing Proper NounsA great proposition of unseen words includesproper nouns like personal, days of month,days of week, country names, city names, banknames, organization names, ocean names, rivernames, university names etc.
and if translatedword to word, their meaning is changed.
If themeaning is not affected, even though this stepfastens the translation process.
Once thesewords are recognized and stored into theproper noun database, there is no need todecide about their translation or transliterationevery time in the case of presence of suchwords in input text for translation.
Thisgazetteer makes the translation accurate andfast.

Thus, to process this sub phase, thesystem requires a proper noun gazetteer thathas been complied offline.
For this task, wehave developed an offline module to extractproper nouns from the corpus based on somerules.
Also, Named Entity recognition modulehas been developed based on the CRFapproach (Sharma R. and Goyal V., 2011b).2.5 TokenizerTokenizers (also known as lexical analyzers orword segmenters) segment a stream ofcharacters into meaningful units called tokens.The tokenizer takes the text generated by preprocessing phase as input.
Individual words ortokens are extracted and processed to generateits equivalent in the target language.
Thismodule, using space, a punctuation mark, asdelimiter, extracts tokens (word) one by onefrom the text and gives it to translation enginefor analysis till the complete input text is readand processed.2.6 Translation EngineThe translation engine is the main componentof our Machine Translation system.
It takestoken generated by the tokenizer as input andoutputs the translated token in the targetlanguage.
These translated tokens areconcatenated one after another along with thedelimiter.
Modules included in this phase areexplained below one by one.2.6.1 Identifying Titles and SurnamesTitle may be defined as a formal appellationattached to the name of a person or family byvirtue of office, rank, hereditary privilege,noble birth, or attainment or used as a mark ofrespect.
Thus word next to title and wordprevious to surname is usually a proper noun.And sometimes, a word used as proper nameof a person has its own meaning in targetlanguage.
Similarly, Surname may be definedas a name shared in common to identify themembers of a family, as distinguished fromeach member's given name.
It is also calledfamily name or last name.
When either title orsurname is passed through the translationengine, it is translated by the system.
Thiscause the system failure as these proper namesshould be transliterated instead of translation.For example consider the Hindi sentence?????
???
??
?????
????
??????
(shr?m?n harsh j?ham?r?
yah??
padh?r?).
In this sentence, ???
(harsh) has the meaning ?joy?.
The equivalenttranslation of ???
(harsh) in target language is????
(khush?).
Similarly, consider the Hindisentence ????
???
?????
????
??????.
(prak?shsi?h ham?r?
yah??
padh?r?).
Here, ????
(prak?sh) word is acting as proper noun and itmust be transliterated and not translatedbecause ???
(si?h) is surname and wordprevious to it is proper noun.Thus, a small module has been developed forlocating such proper nouns to consider them astitle or surname.
There is one special character???
in Devanagari script to mark the symbolslike ??
?, ???.
If this module found this symbolto be title or surname, the word next andprevious to this token as the case may be fortitle or surname respectively, will betransliterated not translated.
The title andsurname database consists of 14 and 654entries respectively.
These databases can beextended at any time to allow new titles andsurnames to be added.
This module was testedon a large Hindi corpus and showed that about2-5 % text of the input text depending upon itsdomain is proper noun.
Thus, this moduleplays an important role in translation.2.6.2 Hindi Morphological analyzerThis module finds the root word for the tokenand its morphological features.Morphologicalanalyzer developed by IIT-H has been portedfor Windows platform for making it usable forthis system.
(Goyal V. and Lehal G.S.,2008a)2.6.3 Word-to-Word translation usinglexicon lookupIf token is not a title or a surname, it is lookedup in the HPDictionary database containingHindi to Punjabi direct word to wordtranslation.
If it is found, it is used fortranslation.
If no entry is found inHPDictionary database, it is sent to next subphase for processing.
The HPDictionarydatabase consists of 54,127 entries.Thisdatabase can be extended at any time to allownew entries in the dictionary to be added.2.6.4 Resolving Ambiguity3Among number of approaches fordisambiguation, the most appropriate approachto determine the correct meaning of a Hindiword in a particular usage for our MachineTranslation system is to examine its contextusing N-gram approach.
After analyzing thepast experiences of various authors, we havechosen the value of n to be 3 and 2 i.e.
trigramand bigram approaches respectively for oursystem.
Trigrams are further categorized intothree different types.
First category of trigramconsists of context one word previous to andone word next to the ambiguous word.
Secondcategory of trigram consists of context of twoadjacent previous words to the ambiguousword.
Third category of the trigram consists ofcontext of two adjacent next words to theambiguous word.
Bigrams are also categorizedinto two categories.
First category of thebigrams consists of context of one previousword to ambiguous word and second categoryof the bigrams consists of one context wordnext to ambiguous word.
For this purpose, theHindi corpus consisting of about 2 millionwords was collected from different sourceslike online newspaper daily news, blogs, PremChand stories, Yashwant jain stories, articlesetc.
The most common list of ambiguouswords was found.
We have found a list of 75ambiguous words out of which the mostfrequent are ??
s?
and ??
aur.
(Goyal V. andLehal G.S., 2011)2.6.5 Handling Unknown Words2.6.5.1 Word Inflectional Analysis andgenerationIn linguistics, a suffix (also sometimes called apostfix or ending) is an affix which is placedafter the stem of a word.
Common examplesare case endings, which indicate thegrammatical case of nouns or adjectives, andverb endings.
Hindi is a (relatively) free word-order and highly inflectional language.Because of same origin, both languages havevery similar structure and grammar.
Thedifference is only in words and inpronunciation e.g.
in Hindi it is ????
and inPunjabi the word for boy is ?????
and evensometimes that is also not there like ??
(ghar)and ??
(ghar).
The inflection forms of boththese words in Hindi and Punjabi are alsosimilar.
In this activity, inflectional analysiswithout using morphology has been performedfor all those tokens that are not processed bymorphological analysis module.
Thus, forperforming inflectional analysis, rule basedapproach has been followed.
When the token ispassed to this sub phase for inflectionalanalysis, If any pattern of the regularexpression (inflection rule) matches with thistoken, that rule is applied on the token and itsequivalent translation in Punjabi is generatedbased on the matched rule(s).
There is also acheck on the generated word for itscorrectness.
We are using correct Punjabiwords database for testing the correctness ofthe generated word.2.6.5.2 TransliterationThis module is beneficial for handling out-of-vocabulary words.
For example the word?????
(vish?l) is transliterated as ?????
(vish?l) whereas translated as ????.
There mustbe some method in every Machine Translationsystem for words like technical terms andproper names of persons, places, objects etc.that cannot be found in translation resourcessuch as Hindi-Punjabi bilingual dictionary,surnames database, titles database etc andtransliteration is an obvious choice for suchwords.
(Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2009a).2.7 Post-Processing2.7.1 Agreement CorrectionsIn spite of the great similarity between Hindiand Punjabi, there are still a number ofimportant agreement divergences in genderand number.
The output generated by thetranslation engine phase becomes the input forpost-processing phase.
This phase will correctthe agreement errors based on the rulesimplemented in the form of regularexpressions.
(Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2011)3 Evaluation and ResultsThe evaluation document set consisted ofdocuments from various online newspapersnews, articles, blogs, biographies etc.
This testbed consisted of 35500 words and wastranslated using our Machine Translationsystem.3.1 Test Document4For our Machine Translation systemevaluation, we have used benchmark samplingmethod for selecting the set of sentences.
Inputsentences are selected from randomly selectednews (sports, politics, world, regional,entertainment, travel etc.
), articles (publishedby various writers, philosophers etc.
), literature(stories by Prem Chand, Yashwant jain etc.
),Official language for office letters (TheLanguage Officially used on the files inGovernment offices) and blogs (Posted bygeneral public in forums etc.).
Care has beentaken to ensure that sentences use a variety ofconstructs.
All possible constructs includingsimple as well as complex ones areincorporated in the set.
The sentence set alocontains all types of sentences such asdeclarative, interrogative, imperative andexclamatory.
Sentence length is not restrictedalthough care has been taken that singlesentences do not become too long.
Followingtable shows the test data set:Table 1: Test data set for the evaluation ofHindi to Punjabi Machine TranslationSystemDailyNewsArticlesOfficialLanguageQuotesBlogLiteratureTotalDocuments100 50 01 50 20TotalSentences10,000 3,500 8,595 3,300 10,045TotalWords93,400 21,674 36,431 15,650 95,5803.2 ExperimentsIt is also important to choose appropriateevaluators for our experiments.
Thus,depending upon the requirements and need ofthe above mentioned tests, 50 People ofdifferent professions were selected forperforming experiments.
20 Persons were fromvillages that only knew Punjabi and did notknow Hindi and 30 persons were fromdifferent professions having knowledge of bothHindi and Punjabi.
Average ratings for thesentences of the individual translations werethen summed up (separately according tointelligibility and accuracy) to get the averagescores.
Percentage of accurate sentences andintelligent sentences was also calculatedseparately by counting the number ofsentences.3.2.1 Intelligibility EvaluationThe evaluators do not have any clue about thesource language i.e.
Hindi.
They judge eachsentence (in target language i.e.
Punjabi) onthe basis of its comprehensibility.
The targetuser is a layman who is interested only in thecomprehensibility of translations.
Intelligibilityis effected by grammatical errors, mis-translations, and un-translated words.3.2.1.1 ResultsThe response by the evaluators were analysedand following are the results:?
70.3 % sentences got the score 3 i.e.
theywere perfectly clear and intelligible.?
25.1 % sentences got the score 2 i.e.
theywere generally clear and intelligible.?
3.5 % sentences got the score 1 i.e.
they werehard to understand.?
1.1 % sentences got the score 0 i.e.
they werenot understandable.So we can say that about 95.40 % sentencesare intelligible.
These sentences are thosewhich have score 2 or above.
Thus, we can saythat the direct approach can translate Hindi textto Punjabi Text with a consideably goodaccuracy.3.2.2 Accuracy Evaluation / FidelityMeasureThe evaluators are provided with source textalong with translated text.
A highly intelligibleoutput sentence need not be a correcttranslation of the source sentence.
It isimportant to check whether the meaning of thesource language sentence is preserved in thetranslation.
This property is called accuracy.3.2.2.1 ResultsInitially Null Hypothesis is assumed i.e.
thesystem?s performance is NULL.
The authorassumes that system is dumb and does notproduce any valuable output.
By theintelligibility of the analysis and Accuracyanalysis, it has been proved wrong.The accuracy percentage for the system isfound out to be 87.60%Further investigations reveal that out of13.40%:?
80.6 % sentences achieve a matchbetween 50 to 99%?
17.2 % of remaining sentences weremarked with less than 50% matchagainst the correct sentences.5?
Only 2.2 % sentences are those whichare found unfaithful.A match of lower 50% does not mean that thesentences are not usable.
After some postediting, they can fit properly in the translatedtext.
(Goyal, V., Lehal, G.S., 2009b)3.2.2 BLEU Score:As there is no Hindi ?Parallel Corpus wasavailable, thus for testing the systemautomatically, we generated Hindi-ParallelCorpus of about 10K Sentences.
The BLEUscore comes out to be 0.7801.5 ConclusionIn this paper, a hybrid translation approachfor translating the text from Hindi toPunjabi has been presented.
The proposedarchitecture has shown extremely goodresults and if found to be appropriate forMT systems between closely relatedlanguage pairs.CopyrightThe developed system has already beencopyrighted with The Registrar, Punjabi University,Patiala with authors same as the authors of thepublication.AcknowlegementWe are thankful to Dr. Amba Kulkarni, Universityof Hyderabad for her support in providing technicalassistance for developing this system.ReferencesBharati, Akshar, Chaitanya, Vineet, Kulkarni,Amba P., Sangal, Rajeev.
