edu tfederica?cs, brandeis, eduAbstractThe analysis of nominal compound constructions has proven to be a recalcitrant problemfor linguistic semantics and poses serious challenges for natural language processing systems.We argue for a compositional treatment of compound constructions which limits the need forlisting of compounds in the lexicon.
We argue that the development of a practical model ofcompound interpretation crucially depends on issues of lexicon design.
The Generative Lexicon(Pustejovsky 1995) provides us with a model of the lexicon which couples ufficiently expressivelexical semantic representations with mechanisms which capture the relationship between thoserepresentations and their syntactic expression.
In our approach, the qualia structures of thenouns in a compound provide relational structure nabling compositional interpretation of themodification of the head noun by the modifying noun.
This brings compound interpretationunder the same rubric as other forms of composition in natural language, including argumentselection, adjectival modification, and type coercion (Pustejovsky (1991,1995), Bouillon 1995).We examine data from both English and Italian and develop analyses for both languages which usephrase structure schemata to account for the connections between lexical semantic representationand syntactic expression.
In addition to applications in natural anguage understanding, machinetranslation, and generation, the model of compound interpretation developed here can be appliedto multi-lingual information extraction tasks.771 Introduct ionThe analysis of nominal compound constructions has proven to be a recalcitrant problem for linguis-tic semantics (Bergsten 1911, Jespersen 1942, Marchand 1970, Lees 1970, Downing 1977, Levi 1978,Warren 1987), and their analysis has presented a serious challenge for natural anguage processingsystems (Finin 1980, McDonald 1982, Isabelle 1984, Alshawi 1987, Hobbs et al1993, Bouillon etal 1992, Jones 1995, Johnston, Boguraev, and Pustejovsky 1995).
In this paper, we argue thatcomposition in compound constructions involves specification of the arguments of predicate struc-tures within the qualia structure of the head noun.
In essence, the qualia structure provides the'glue' which links together the semantic ontributions of modifying nouns and the head noun inthe compound.
This approach as significant advantages over approaches which introduce abstractrelations to describe the form of modification i volved (Levi 1978, Jones 1995), in that it assimilatesthe composition of complex nominals to other compositional processes of natural anguage.
Thepredicates in the qualia are not there just to account for compounds but also to account for a widevariety of forms of composition and interpretation i cluding argument selection, adjectival modi-fication, and type coercion (Pustejovsky (1991,1995), Bouillon 1995).
In order to account for theavailability of compounds and other complex nominals we utilize phrase structure schemata whichcapture the different ways in which head nouns and modifying nouns can compose.
We develop andillustrate our approach using data from English and Italian.
Consider the correspondences belowin (1).
(1) a. bread knife b. wine glass c. bullet holecoltello d___a pane bicchiere d_.a vino foro d~ pallottolad.
lemon juice e. glass door f. silicon breastsucco d_._i limone porta _a vetri seni ~ siliconeEnglish compounds consist of sequences of nouns.
The final noun is the head and the othersare modifiers.
Italian, on the other hand, generally avoids compounds.
Most of the compoundsthat are possible involve an underived verb (e.g.
portadocumenti (document holder), segnalibro(bookmark), spaventapasseri (scarecrow), etc.)
1 In place of the compound construction, Italianutilizes post-modifying prepositional phrases to construct complex nominals.Consider first the forms in (la) and (lb).
In both of these forms the modifying noun providesinformation regarding the purpose or function of object described by the head noun.
In (la), breadspecifies the object which the knife is typically used to cut.
In (lb), wine specifies the substancethat the glass is used to hold.
For forms in which the modifier specifies ome aspect of the purposeof the head, the preposition in the Italian form generally is da.In (lc) and (ld), the modifier relates to the origin of the object described by the head noun,how it was brought about.
A bullet hole is a hole which was brought about by the passage of abullet, and lemon juice is juice that is brought about by squeezing a lemon.
For forms in which themodifier specifies ome aspect of the origin of the head, the appropriate preposition for the Italianform appears to be di.In (le) and (lf), the modifier relates to the constitution of the object described by the headnoun, what it is made of.
A glass door is a door made of glass, while a silicon breast is a breast,at least partially, composed of silicon.
For forms in which the modifier specifies the constitution ofthe head, the appropriate preposition in Italian is a.In English, the form of the semantic relation that holds between the modifying noun and the1See Beard(1996) for an interesting account of why Italian does not utilize the compound construction.78head noun is unspecified and left implicit, while in the corresponding Italian complex nominals,it is partially specified by the preposition which introduces the modifying noun.
This differencebetween English and Italian is representative of a more general difference in structure betweenGermanic languages and Romance languages.
Complex nominal expressions in Germanic languagesfrequently involve compounding while complex nominals in Romance languages use post-modifyingprepositional phrases.
One motivation for examination of parallel data from English and Italianis that it can reveal the otherwise implicit relation between the elements of an English compound.This difference in the internal structure of nominals has important consequences for multilinguallanguage processing.
For example, in order to translate English complex nominals into Italian youneed to determine the nature of the semantic relation in the compound in order to determine thepreposition to use in the Italian form.
We return to applications of this work later in Section 7.Our analysis of compounds in English and complex nominals in Italian utilizes the representationalframework of the Generative Lexicon (GL) (Pustejovsky 1991,1995).
The next section provides abrief sketch of this approach.2 The Generat ive LexiconFor the purposes of this paper, we will simplify the representational structure of a GL lexical entryto include four levels of representation: type structure, argument structure, event structure (forverbs), and qualia structure.
The latter in turn expresses four aspects of the meaning of the lexicalitem: FORMAL, CONSTITUTIVE, TELIC, and AGENTIVE.
These lexical entries are encoded usingtyped feature structures.
The basic layout of the lexical entries we employ is given in (2).
(2)TYPESTR = ~ ARG\ ]  = the  type  of  aL J= I D-AR61 = other arguments in the qual ia\]  ARGSTRL JEVENTSTR = /El  = events in the qual ia/L" FORMAL = i sa - re la t ionCONSTITUTIVE f f i  parts o f  QUALIA  ffi TELIC = purl~ose of  c~AGENTIVE  = hOW Ol is brought aboutGiven this model of lexical representation a noun such as knife has the entry in (3).
Thepredicates in the qualia specify the definitional properties of knife.
Participants in these predicatesother than the knife itself are listed as default arguments (D-AR~I, D-ARC2, and D-ARG3) in79ARGSTR.

All of the representations for single wordsand complex nominals throughout the rest of the paper consist only of the value of CONTENT.The phrase structure schemata presented contain full lexical entries which have a CONTENTattribute as well as an ORTH and a DTRS attribute.In the following three sections, we will show how the free classes of compounds considered sofar can be treated as instances of telic, agentive, and constitutive qualia modification respectively.3 Te l i c  Qua l ia  Mod i f i ca t ionIn order to illustrate our approach, we will start with examples uch as bread knife (la), in whichthe modifying noun relates to the purpose of the head noun.
The preferred interpretation of thiscompound is that it is a knife which is used to cut bread.
The fact that a knife is an object whoseinherent purpose is to cut things is encoded by the predicate cut_act in the TELIC role (see (3)above).
The function of the modifier bread is to specify the third argument of the cut__act relation.The feature structure associated with bread knife will be as in (4).
The first default argumentD-ARG1 has been specialized from physobj  to bread and this value is structure-shared with thethird argument position in the cut_act predicate.

These schemata re essentially the same kind of entity as the Imme-80diate Dominance Schemata employed in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Pollard and Sag1994).
They are schemata which license the availability of complex nominals, which we treat asphrasal signs.
These schemata re essentially phrase structure rules.
Compounds are licensed andinterpreted as part of the process of parsing.The combination of words into compound forms could also be captured using lexical rules(Flickinger 1987, Pollard and Sag 1987).
We have chosen to use phrase structure schemata ratherthan lexical rules on the basis of storage considerations.
Each lexical rule used for compounds willlicense a great many modifiers for large number of potential heads.
If the lexical rules are used ata pre-compilation stage in order to flesh out the lexicon, allowing lexical rules for compounds willresult in a massive increase in the size of the lexicon.
For each noun, a huge number of compoundforms will be generated.
If you allow lexical rules for compounds to apply at runtime during theparsing process, then the storage problem is avoided, but then they are really not any differentfrom phrase structure schemata.We will show the schemata as rules here.
They can also be encoded as single feature structures.The basic structure of the schemata licensing the combination of nouns to form noun compoundsis as in (5).MODIF IER  NOUN HEAD=:~(5)COMPOUNDDTRS = I HEAD --The schemata differ with respect o the constraints placed on the CONTENT values and the wayin which the CONTENT values of the head and the modifier are composed to generate the CONTENTfor the compound as a whole.
The availability of compound forms such as bread knife, where themodifier specifies an argument in the TELIC, is accounted for by the schema in (6).MODIF IER  NOUN HEADCONTENT = \[OONTENT -- D\]COMPOUND(6)MOD =In this notation, the structures describing semantic types are the values of an attribute CON-TENT, and ORTH specifies the orthographic form.
The CONTENT of  the resulting compound isinherited from the head noun.
In order to access the argument in the TELIC, the CONTENT valueof the modifier is structure-shared with the first default argument in the CONTENT of the head.The modifying noun must be of semantic type individual  and its CONTENT value is structure-shared with the D-ARG1 in the ARGSTR of the resulting compound.
The lexical representationof the compound also contains an attribute DTRS containing a HEAD and a MOD value.
Theseare structure-shared with the lexical representations for the head noun and the modifying noun81respectively.This schema is one of a number which are used to license this kind of modification of defaultarguments.
There will also be schemata for modification of other default arguments.
The fact thatthe CONTENT of the compound always comes from the head noun is captured by having all of thecompound phrase structure schemata, which are themselves implemented as types, all inherit theconstraint specified by the structure-sharing i dex E\].As we saw before, if the modifier specifies an argument in the TELIC qualia role, the prepositionin Italian is da.
In order to account for the Italian forms, as in the English case, we utilize phrasestructure schemata.
In this case, the schema (7) specifies that the sequence HEAD NOUN, da,MODIFYING NOUN can be interpreted as having the semantic ontent of the modifying nounspecify one of the arguments within the TELIC role.HEAD MODIFIER NOUN\[\]\[ORTH = ~ \ [~\ ] \ ]da  ~\[ORTH = fl ~ ind iv idua l \ ]= .
~COMPOUNDfORTH = a da flI.
t M?D =The indeterminacy with respect o which argument in the TELIC is coindexed with the modifierin schema (7) is a shorthand representation.
A number of phrase structure schemata are used, eachspecifying linking to a different argument position in the TELIC.For Italian, the nature of the modification can alternatively be directly encoded in the lexicalentry for the preposition.
The composition could then licensed by a more general phrase structureschema which would work with all of the different prepositions.4 Agent ive Qualia Modif icat ionCompounds uch as bullet hole and lemon juice (1 c,d), in which the modifier elates to the originor bringing about of the object described by the head noun, are treated as modification of theAGENTIVE role.
In the case of lemon juice, the head juice will have a squeeze_act as its AGENTIVEand the object squeezed will be listed as a default argument.
The function of the modifying nounlemon is to further subtype this argument.
This is possible because lemon is a subtype of fruit.These English forms will be accounted for by another schema licensing default argument typespecification, like that in (6) above.
The resulting representation for lemon juice is as in (8).
Thecorresponding forms in Italian utilize the preposition di.
The Italian forms are accounted for by aschema like (8), except hat the preposition is di and the linkage is to the AGENTIVE qualia role.

Examples of this are given in (1 e,f).In our treatment, his involves modification of the CONSTITUTIVE role.
The prepositions used inItalian for this: sort of modification are a and al.
The modifiers glass and silicon denote materials.When composed with nominals uch as door and breast hey specify elements of the CONSTITUT IVErole.
For example, glass door is represented as in (9).
These forms are licensed using further phrasestructure schemata for English and Italian.(9)?

This is a useful generalization but the correspondence b tweenthe different qualia roles and different choices of preposition in Italian is not as clear cut as thissuggests.
In the examples of TELIC qualia modification considered so far (1 a,b), the modifyingnoun was always of type indiv idual .
Matters become more complex when compounds in whichthe modifying noun describes an event are considered.
These are addressed in the next section.6 Telic Event ModifiersIn some forms where the modifier describes an event, the appropriate preposition in Italian is da,as in the forms in (10), while others the preposition is di, as in the forms in (11).
(10) a. hunting rifle b. race car c. carving woodfucile d._._a caccia macchina d__a corsa legno d___a intaglio(11) a. destruction weapons b. credit card c. rest homeaxmi d i distruzione carta d~ credito casa d~ riposod.
concentration camp e. divorce procedurecampo d_..i concentramento procedura di divorzioIn general, the TELIC use of  the preposition di appears to select consistently for modifiers whichdenote events.
Even though this does not yet explain the difference between (10) and (11), italready provides us with a restriction on the use of prepositions.
In other words da selects forany type, while di is restricted to events.
We assume the Vendlerian distinction between activities,states, accomplishments, and achievements.
In addition, we adopt a decompositional view of eventstructure, as outlined in Pustejovsky (1991), in which the event structure representation of alexical item makes reference to the configurational properties of subevents and arguments.
In83this framework, which allows us to make fine grained distinctions between event types, we candetermine the selectional properties of di and da, on the basis of the event type of the modifiers.Nominals such as hunting, race, and carving describe activities.
Nominals such as destruction,credit, and so on, in (11) above, describe the result of an activity.
This distinction arises quiteclearly in the glosses of (10) and (11).
Compound forms such as hunting rifle or race car in (10),describe respectively an instrument which is used when hunting, and a vehicle that is driven forthe purpose of racing.
Conversely, the reading of the compounds in (11) makes explicit the resultwhich is achieved by using a particular object.
In particular ( l la)  refers to weapons that bringabout destruction; ( l lb)  to a card that brings about a credit, and so on.Unlike the operation which derives bread knife by associating the modifier to an argumentposition in the TELIC role of bread, the compositional operations which involve events producea more complex structure.
We argue that compounds where the modifying noun describes anevent, such as those in (10), involve co-composition of the qualia structures of the head and themodifier.
The resulting representation has a complex TELIC role with "sub-qualia".
In the caseof hunting rifle, the TELIC of rifle, which is fire provides the AGENTIVE within the TELIC of thecompound.
The modifier hunting is a process nominal and provides hunt  as the TELIC within theTELIC of the compound.
Through the application of phrase structure schemata which constrainthis co-composition, we obtain the representation in (12) for hunting rifle.?
hunt ing  rifleTYPESTR = \[ARG1 = \[~\] rifle\]\[ D-ARG1 = ~\]humanARGSTR = \[ D-ARG2 \[_Llprey= \[D-E1 = ~process"(12) EVENTSTR L D- 2 \[.~...j p rocess"FORMAL = \ [ \ ]activityAcpQUALIA ffi TELIC = TELIC = hunt( ~\ ] , \ [~\ ] ,  \ [ \ ] )AGENTIVE = f i re (~_ J ,  \[~\], \ [ \ ] )The interpretation of the compound form hunting rifle can be glossed as follows:"a rifle which isused in its typical capacity (i.e.
firing) for the purpose of performing the activity of hunting."
Theassignment of a complex structure to an individual quale is coherent with the general interpretationof qualia structure.
Exploiting these recursive properties of event-denoting qualia is not an ad-hocmove to account for the interpretation of complex nominals but is also motivated by the behaviorof agentive nominals and their semantic ontribution in context (cf.
Busa 1996).The modifying noun in Italian complex nominals with the preposition di describes the resultthat is achieved by performing the particular function associated with the head noun.
The nominaldestruction, in ( l la) ,  unlike the event nouns hunting and race which denote activities, is the nom-inalization of the transitional event denoted by the verb destroy.
The two subevents, namely theprocess and the resulting state, in the event structure representation f the verb, are encoded inthe nominalized form as separate vents in the AGENTIVE and FORMAL roles, and they are relatedby the relation of temporal precedence <o~.
As argued in Pustejovsky (1995) this representationgives rise to the polysemous behavior of the nominal.
It alternates between a processand a resultinterpretation.
In destruction weapon, the embedded AGENTIVE in the TELIC is again the TELIC ofthe head weapon, and the embedded TELIC is the resulting state from the semantics of destruction.84!The resulting TEL IC  is a process-resul t - lcp,  as shown in (13).

.
.The analysis of AGENTIVE  modification is also more complex.
In addition to di, della is alsofound for subtyping of arguments in the AGENTIVE .
In other cases, such as morte da annegamento,death from drowning and bruciatura da sole, sun burn, the preposition is da.
This preposition dahas a different meaning from the one associated with the TELIC.
It corresponds to the Englishpreposition from and it is interpreted as introducing an experiencing relation.
It is found in caseswhere the head noun is an event and the modifier introduces the causal factor which brought aboutthat event.
We turn now to consider some of the applications of this work in more detail.7 ApplicationsThe analysis of complex nominal constructions presented in this paper has a range of importantapplications in natural language processing.
Complex nominals play an important role in theencapsulation and expression of nominal concepts and are frequent in a wide variety of types oftexts.
Therefore, the ability to handle complex nominals is essential for parsing and generationsystems for either English or Italian.
It is important o note that systems utilizing compositionalapparatus for the analysis of complex nominals need not treat all compounds compositionally.
Theoptimal arrangement will be to list frequent and idiosyncratic ompound forms in the lexicon anduse the compositional pparatus for forms which are not listed, or in instances when the listedinterpretation is ruled out by context.
We would also like to point out that we do not expect todevelop an analysis which will handle all and every compound form.
Our target is to have anaccount which will handle the majority of productive compounding patterns.
Another importantuse of the compositional pparatus described here is in lexical acquisition of compound forms.This machinery can be used to indicate potential interpretations for compounds.
A human editorcan then select the appropriate interpretation from the candidate set and add have the compoundadded to the lexicon.Given the range of different semantic relations that can hold between the elements of a complexnominal, they are frequently ambiguous.
English compounds are worse than Italian post-modifiedforms in this respect, since in Italian the preposition gives at least some indication of the relationinvolved.
The approach described in this paper constrains the interpretation of complex nominalsusing the type system.
For example, the schema in (6), which accounts for bread knife, requires themodifying noun to be typed as indiv idual .
This limits the set of potential modifiers to those typedas indiv idual .
Since the content of the modifier is structure-shared with an argument position85within the TELIC, this set of potential modifiers is further constrained by type constraints imposedby the relation in the TELIC role.
The cut_act will require the object cut to be a separable object.It could potentially require the cutter to be significantly harder than the object to be cut.
Typeconstraints of this kind serve to greatly reduce the degree of ambiguity in a given complex nominal,but it will still generally be the case that more than one interpretation is predicted for a given form.For example, a form like bone knife could be interpreted either as a knife used for cutting bone or aknife made of bone.
The approach described here needs to be integrated with further mechanismsand heuristics in order to determine the best guess for complex nominal interpretation i anygiven case.
One important class of mechanisms are those which examine the current sententialand discourse context in order to restrict the range of interpretations.
For example, if bone knifeappears in a medical text, bone most probably specifies the object to be cut by the knife, while if itshows up in a text concerning prehistoric man, bone most probably refers to the constitution of theknife.
One way in which compounds can be further disambiguated is through the incorporation of astatistical model as one of the heuristics employed in determining the appropriate interpretation.
Insuch an approach, one could train on a data set comprised of compounds paired with an indicationof the relation holding between the head and the modifier.
The resulting model would provide theprobability that a given complex nominal involves a particular kind of modification relation.
Inorder to have useful predictive power, it would be best to assign semantic types to the elements of thecomplex nominal and determine the probability that a complex nominal consisting of words of typesA and B involves modification relation C. Given the sparsity of data to support a statistically basedapproach we believe that the way forward in this area is to pursue the integration of a rule-basedapproach with a statistical model.
Such integration has already proven effective in the treatmentof sense extension phenomena (Copestake and Briscoe 1995).
We leave further investigation of thisintegration for future work.This work also has important consequences for applications in multilingual natural languageprocessing.
The most obvious of these is the use of a cross-linguistic approach to complex nominalsin machine translation.
Translation of complex nominals from Italian to English will be morestraightforward, since there is a loss of information rather than a gain.
It is important o note,however, that not all Italian complex nominals involving post-modification can be translated asnoun-noun compounds in English.
For example, forms such as coltello d._..a macellaio (literally, knifeof butcher), in which the modifier is an agent using the object described by the head, does nottranslate as butcher knife.
In English, the appropriate nominal construction i  this case uses thepossessive: butcher's knife.Translation from English to Italian is substantially more difficult given the difference in ex-plicitness regarding the semantic relation between the head and modifier.
In order to generatethe proper output in Italian, it is necessary to determine the relation between the elements in theEnglish compound structure and to determine the appropriate preposition in Italian for expressionof that relation.
One approach to this task is to use the GL representation language ssentially asan interlingua (McDonald 1995).
The phrase structure schemata for English are used in order todetermine potential interpretations for a given English compound construction.
The most likelyinterpretation from the candidate set is picked on the basis of contextual and statistical models.The CONTENT of the chosen candidate is then matched against he outputs of the various phrasestructure schemata used for Italian.
When an appropriate schema is identified it is instantiatedwith lexical items from the Italian lexicon in order to generate the Italian translation.
An im-portant feature of this approach is that it utilizes resources which are independently needed foranalysis of the languages involved.
Aside from translation, the phrase structure schemata can alsobe used for multi-lingual generation.
If a particular concept is encoded in the GL lexical represen-tation language, the language-specific phrase structure schemata can be employed to generate the86corresponding complex nominal in each language.In addition to the importance of successful translation of complex nominals for full-text machinetranslation, this functionality is useful in itself for applications in multi-lingual information retrievaland information extraction.
Since complex nominals are so frequently used to coin terms whichencapsulate important distinguished concepts within a domain, their successful identification andprocessing is an essential element of determination of the topic of a text and the:, provide importanthooks for information retrieval.
In a multi-lingual setting, such as information retrieval over theWorld Wide Web, it may be desirable for a search for a complex nominal from one language toyield documents regarding the same concept in other languages.
The approach to translation ofcomplex nominals described above enables this functionality.
For a given form compound form inEnglish it is possible to determine potential realizations of that form in Italian.8 ConclusionIn this paper, we have shown how the theory of qualia structure within the Generative Lexicon, en-ables a compositional treatment of compounds.
In compounds where the modifying noun describesan individual, in composition, the modifier further specifies the type of an argument to a predicatein the TELIC, AGENTIVE, or CONSTITUTIVE role.
In Italian, the canonical prepositions for thesethree kinds of modification are da, di, and a, respectively.
In compounds where the modifying noundenotes an event, the composition i  the compound frequently involves co-composition between thequalia structure of the head and modifier.
In Italian, for TELIC modification the preposition is dawhen the modifier describes an activity and di when the modifier describes a result.
In additionto its theoretical relevance, the approach to the semantics of complex nominals described here hasimportant applications in the construction of natural anguage processing systems.
In particular, itprovides the foundations for machine translation of complex nominals between English and Italianand can be readily applied in multi-lingual generation and multi-lingual information extraction.ReferencesAlshawi, Hiyan.1987.
