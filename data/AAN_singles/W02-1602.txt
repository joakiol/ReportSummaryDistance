Coedition to share text revision across languagesand improve MT a posterioriChristian BOITETGETA, CLIPS, IMAG385 rue de la Biblioth?que, BP 5338041 Grenoble cedex 9, FranceChristian.Boitet@imag.frTSAI Wang-JuGETA, CLIPS, IMAG385 rue de la Biblioth?que, BP 5338041 Grenoble cedex 9, FranceWang-Ju.Tsai@imag.frAbstractCoedition of a natural language text and its representation in some interlingual form seems the best and simplest way toshare text revision across languages.
For various reasons, UNL graphs are the best candidates in this context.
We aredeveloping a prototype where, in the simplest sharing scenario, naive users interact directly with the text in theirlanguage (L0), and indirectly with the associated graph.
The modified graph is then sent to the UNL-L0 deconverter andthe result shown.
If is is satisfactory, the errors were probably due to the graph, not to the deconverter, and the graph issent to deconverters in other languages.
Versions in some other languages known by the user may be displayed, so thatimprovement sharing is visible and encouraging.
As new versions are added with appropriate tags and attributes in theoriginal multilingual document, nothing is ever lost, and cooperative working on a document is rendered feasible.
On theinternal side, liaisons are established between elements of the text and the graph by using broadly available resourcessuch as a L0-English or better a L0-UNL dictionary, a morphosyntactic parser of L0, and a canonical graph2treetransformation.
Establishing a "best" correspondence between the "UNL-tree+L0" and the "MS-L0 structure", a lattice,may be done using the dictionary and trying to align the tree and the selected trajectory with as few crossing liaisons aspossible.
A central goal of this research is to merge approaches from pivot MT, interactive MT, and multilingual textauthoring.Keywords: revision sharing, interlingual representation, text / UNL coedition, multilingual communicationR?sum?La co?dition d'un texte en langue naturelle et de sa repr?sentation dans une forme interlingue semble le moyen lemeilleur et le plus simple de partager la r?vision du texte vers plusieurs langues.
Pour diverses raisons, les graphes UNLsont les meilleurs candidats dans ce contexte.

In the currentpractice, a multilingual document consists in manyparallel monolingual files, which may be technicaldocumentation as well as help files, message files,or simply thematic information put on the web andintended for a multilingual audience (medicine,cooking, travel?).
The task is difficult even for adocument managed in a centralized manner.Ususally, it is first created in a unique sourcelanguage, and translated into several targetlanguages.
There must be a way to keep trak ofmodifications, possibly done at various places ondifferent linguistic versions.
From time to time,somebody has to decide which modifications tointegrate in the next release of the document.
Forthat, modifications done in target languages have tobe translated back into the source language.
Thenew and the old source versions are then comparedusing (fuzzy) matching techniques, so that onlyreally new segments are sent for translation.The problem arises even more if the documents arenot managed centrally, so that the monolingual filesare often in various formats (Word, EgWord,Interleaf, FileMaker, DBMS formats, etc.).A.
Assimi [1, 2] has shown how to "realign"parallel decentralized documents and apply themethodology sketched above.
However, in bothcases, human translators have to retranslate themodified or new source segments, or to revise themif they are retranslated by a quality MT system.Contrary to what is often said, quality MT exists,but for specific contexts only.
(See [14]).What we would like to do is to make it possible toshare the revision work across languages, whateverthe domain and the context.
It is clearly impossibleto reflect changes on a file in language L0 into filesin L1,?
Ln automatically and faithfully, withoutany intermediate structure to bridge the gap,because that would necessitate at least a perfectfine-grained aligner in case of changing articles orcommon nouns (provided the gender and numberstay the ame in each Li version).
In case ofreplacing a verb by another with a different valencyframe in a target Li, the sentence in Li would haveto be reanalyzed, transformed accordingly, andregenerated without introducing any new error orimprecision, thereby keeping the manualimprovements coming from previous manualrevisions.
Or we would need a more than perfectMT system, namely one which would be able toanalyze the changed utterance in L0, and to transferand generate it into a sentence of Li as close aspossible as the previous sentence in Li, which againcould have been improved manually before.The best and simplest way to go seems to use someformalized interlingua IL and to(1) reflect the modifications from L0 to the IL,(2) regenerate into L1,?
Ln from the IL.We should also allow for direct manualimprovements, considering that the IL form will notalways be present, or not always improvableenough for lack of expressivity, or that generatorswill never be perfect.
We choose UNL [3, 4, 10,11] as our IL of choice for various reasons:(1) it is specifically designed for linguistic andsemantic machine processing,(2) it derives with many improvements fromH.Uchida's pivot used in ATLAS-II (Fujitsu)[13], still evaluated as the best quality MT systemfor English-Japanese, with a large coverage(586,000 lexical entries in each language),(3) participants of the UNL project1 have built"deconverters" from UNL into about 12languages, and at least the Arabic, Indonesian,Italian, French, Russian, Spanish, and Thai1http://unl.ias.unu.edudeconverters were accessible for experimentationthrough a web interface at the time of writing,(4) although formal, UNL graphs (see below) arequite easy to understand with little training andmay be presented in a "localized" way to naiveusers by translating UNL symbols (semanticrelations, attributes) and lexemes (UWs) intosymbols and lexemes of their language,(5) the UNL project has defined a format embed-ded in html for files containing a completemultilingual document aligned at the level ofutterances, and produced a "visualizer" trans-forming a UNL file into as many html files aslanguages, and sending them to any web browser.The UNL representation of a text is a list of"semantic graphs", each expressing the meaning ofa natural language utterance.
Nodes contain lexicalunits and attributes, arcs bear semantic relations.Connex subgraphs may be defined as "scopes", sothat a UNL graph may be a hypergraph.The lexical units, called Universal Words (UW),represent (sets of) word meanings, something lessambitious than concepts.
Their denotations are builtto be intuitively understood by developers knowingEnglish, that is, by all developers in NLP.
AUW isan English term or special symbol (number?
)possibly completed by semantic restrictions : theUW "process" represents all word meanings of thatlemma, seen as citation form (verb or noun here),and "process(icl>do, agt>person)" covers only themeanings of processing, working on, etc.The attributes are the (semantic) number, genre,time, aspect, modality, etc., and the 40 or sosemantic relations are traditional "deep cases" suchas agent, (deep) object, location, goal, time, etc.One way of looking at a UNL graph correspondingto an utterance in language L is to say that itrepresents the abstract structure of an equivalentEnglish utterance "seen from L", that is, wheresemantic attributes not necessarily expressed in Lmay be absent (e.g., aspect coming from French,determination or number from Japanese, etc.
).We will first present scenarios of increasing internalcomplexity for the situation where somebody readsa UNL document in her language, corrects it, andwants the corrections to carry over to the corres-ponding fragment in other languages.
We will thenstudy more precisely the correspondence between atext in language L0 and its representation in UNL,and show the advantage of breaking it into 3 parts:text ?
morpho-syntactic lattice or chart ?
abstract"UNL-tree" ?
UNL graph.
Finally, we present thecurrent status of this work: an experimentation website, a method to establish the second part of thecorrespondence, and related research.1 .
Scenarios for sharing revision acrosslanguagesSuppose a collection of multilingual documents isstored on a server as multilingual files in UNL-htmlformat, or in any other form, e.g.
in a data base,provided (1) it is possible to easily produce theversion in any language contained in the document,(2) the versions are aligned at the level of utterance-like segments (a segment may contain more than 1utterance), (3) UNL-graphs may be stored andaligned with the segments.
Here is a slightlysimplified example of a file in UNL-html format.<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Example 1  El/UNL</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>[D:dn=Mar Example 1, on= UNL French,mid=First.Author@here.com][P][S:1]{org:el}I ran in the park yesterday.{/org}{unl}agt(run(icl>do).@entry.@past,i(icl>person))plc(run(icl>do).@entry.@past,park(icl>place).@def)tim(run(icl>do).@entry.

[/S] [/P][/D]</BODY></HTML>The French versions have been producedautomatically, the German and Chinese manually.The output of the UNL viewer for French is:<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Example 1  El/UNL</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>J?ai couru dans le parc hier.Mon chien aboya pour moi.</BODY></HTML>and will probably be displayed by a browser as:Example 1  El/UNLJ?ai couru dans le parc hier.
Mon chien aboya pourmoi.and similarly for all other languages.
In allscenarios, the user is reading the text in the normaldisplay, not seing any tags, and wants to make somemodification, such as moving "hier" after "couru"and changing "pour" to "vers".
Activating somebutton or menu item, she enters a revision interface.1.1 Multiple revision without sharingIn this first scenario, we don't suppose that there areUNL graphs associated with the segments.
Theproblem is to transmit and add the user's modifi-cations to the original form of the multilingualdocument.
That is impossible by editing the htmldocuments displayed, because they have no links tothe original form.
The UNL-html format predatesXML, hence the special tags like [S] and {unl}, butwe may transform it into an equivalent "UNL-xml"format.
Then, using DOM and javaScript, it ispossible to produce various views: that of a viewer,a bilingual or multilingual editable presentation,and a revision (coedition) interface.This is an example from an experiment performedfor the "Forum Barcelona 2004" on Spanish,Italian, Russian, French and Hindi.Hindi and Russian are not shown, butJapanese has been added by hand.
TheXML form is simplified.Correct sentences are produced by thedeconverters from correct andcomplete UNL graphs.
We supposehere that the UNL graph has beenproduced from a Chinese version, anddoes not countain definiteness andaspectual information.

In order toshare the revisions across languages, we shouldreflect them on the UNL graph, e.g.?
add ".
@def" on the nodes "city" & "Forum".?
replace "retrieve" by "recover" and add".
@complete" on the node containing it.It is not possible in principle to deduce themodification on the graph from a modification onthe text.
For example, replacing "un" ("a") by "le"("the") does not entail that the following noun isdetermined (.
@def), because it can also be generic("il aime la montagne" = "he likes mountains").Hence, the technique envisaged is that:?
revision is not done by modifying directly thetext, but by using a menu system,?
the menu items have a "language side" and ahidden "UNL side",?
when a menu item is chosen, only the graph istransformed, and the action to be done on the textis stored and shown next to its focus.?
at any time, the new graph may be sent to theL0 deconverter and the result shown.
If is issatisfactory, that shows that errors were due to thegraph and not to the deconverter, and the graphmay be sent to deconverters in other languages.Versions in some other languages known by theuser may be displayed, so that improvementsharing is visible and encouraging.New versions will be added with appropriate tagsand attributes in the multilingual document in UNL-xml format, or in a DBMS, so that nothing is lost,and cooperative working on a document is feasible.1.3 Revision on more than the textsFor the above method to work, the text has to bepreprocessed, at least by computing morpho-syntactic classes (POS & actualization attributes) toavoid many spurious menus, segmenting, andlemmatizing.
Because we want our technique to bewidely applicable, this preprocessing should besuch that it can be performed by large coveragetools freely available for many languages.
That isthe case for morphosyntactic analyzers (MSA), butnot yet for full or even shallow parsers.We also propose that the revision interface shouldallow access not only to the texts, but to editablerepresentations of the UNL graph, of the result ofthe MSA, and of any other available structure suchas a tree derived from the UNL graph.QuitSaveMultiple text viewSimple text viewOriginal textTo DoSecond DeconversionManual InsertionUne cit?

Butthere are good reasons to "open the black box":(1) the UNL Spanish group has successfullyexperimented with an interface for interactiveUNL graph creation using a MSA and a grapheditor showing the UNL graph in a "localized"way (symbols & lexemes appear in Spanish),(2) it is sometimes much quicker to changesomething on another representation than on atext: for example, to merge two nodes in order tochange "Mary likes Mary's daughter" into "Marylikes her daughter",(3) it may even be necessary, if the correspondenceis faulty and can not be improved because the textis very far from any reasonable deconversionobtainable from the graph,(4) user interface technology has made muchprogress, and offers tools to build user-friendlydirect manipulation environments,(5) last but not least, the younger generationmanipulates complex interfaces very naturally andexpertly, far better than its elders!1.4 What can and cannot be doneWe identify 4 common types of errors in the corpuswe have analysed so far:(1) graphs containing false information: wrongattachment, wrong choice of UW, wrongattribute, wrong semantic relation?
(2) graphs with missing information, as above,(3) absence of text because the UNL graph isformally incorrect (due to some wrong humanmanipulation, some bug in a deconverter?
):missing parenthesis, missing entry node in ascope, disconnected graph?,(4) deconversion errors.Our method can be used for correcting the first 2types of errors only.
If a graph is formally incorrect,it may displayable or not.
In the first case, it shouldbe possible to manipulate and correct it graphically,e.g.
by connecting 2 disconnected parts or choosingan entry node.
In the second case, it is necessary towork on a textual representation.
If errors comefrom the deconverter, the user may still correct thetext by hand (last zone).2.
Establishing a text?graph correspondence2.1 The nature of correspondencesThe correspondence between a text and a UNLgraph may be decomposed into less complexliaisons, which are often not simple links, evenbetween words and nodes.
We found the followingtypes in this case.MS level UNL graphlemmaarbre (French)UW headword"tree"lemma??????

@completeMS actualization featurepluralattribute.
@plMS semantic featurehisrelationpos(*, he)2.2 Division in 3 subcorrespondencesWe have already begun to break down thecorrespondence in 2 parts: text ?
MS-structure ?UNL graph.
The MS structure may always beembedded in a loop-free graph with information onthe nodes (lattice) or on the arcs (charts), so that thefirst part of the correspondence is made of liaisonsbetween substrings of the text (not necessarilyalways connex) and elements (nodes or arcs) on thetrajectory corresponding to the preferredinterpretation (in case of ambiguity).It is perhaps possible to compute a directcorrespondence between the MS lattice and theUNL graph, but it is not clear how to represent theliaisons between phrases and subgraphs.
For thatpurpose, a tree structure is far better.
Because thereis no available large-scale and free syntactico-semantic analyzer for the vast majority oflanguages, we can not use even a tree produced by ashallow parser.
But it is possible to associate a"standard UNL-tree" to any UNL graph by areversible algorithmic transformation [3, 4, 10]:start at the outer entry node, and traverse the graphand its scopes (subgraphs) recursively, therebycreating auxiliary nodes for scopes, "inverse"semantic relations for arcs in the "wrong" direction,and coindexing symbols to represent reentrancywithout duplication.We can also take advantage of having one morestructure by enriching it with lexical units of L0.Now the correspondence is broken into 3 parts:?
text ?
MS-L0 (a lattice or a chart),?
MS-L0 ?
UNL-tree+L0 (an unorderedabstract quasi-dependency tree), and?
UNL-tree+L0 ?
UNL-graph (liaisons may beproduced by modifying the standard reversiblegraph2tree transformation).Another advantage of introducing this tree structureis that the correspondences between strings andabstract trees have been much studied [5, 15, 16].They can be encoded within the trees by 2 attributesexpressing what a node covers lexically (SNODE)and as root of a subtree (STREE).3.
Current status and related research3.1 Experimental platformWe have implemented a web site called SWIIVRE-UNL2 (Site on the Web for the Initiation,Information, Validation, Research and Experi-mentation on UNL [12]) as an experimental basisfor our research.
It currently allows to:?
get dynamic information on UNL sites,?
access a collection of documents (specs,articles) on UNL,?
browse a collection of aligned sentences andUNL graphs in many languages?
experiment multilingual deconversion,?
try the first version of a Web and XML-oriented UNL graph editor, limited to simplegraphs (trees), and programmed using more tags(UNL-xml-ed), DOM, and javaScript [9].3.2 Building the lattice-tree correspondenceLet us outline the method (currently underimplementation) to compute a "best" corres-pondence.
We start with an MS-L0 lattice linked tothe text and a UNL-tree produced in a standard wayand linked to the UNL graph.
The goal is toestablish liaisons between the lattice and the tree,and to order the tree so that it is maximally alignedwith the lattice, hence with the text.
Suppose wehave only an L0-English dictionary.First, we enrich the lattice with English lemmasand the UNL-tree with lemmas of L0, producingMS-L0+EN and UNL-tree+L0.
Then, we establishlinks between nodes of the lattice and of the treehaving lemmas in common (in L0 or in English),and compute a score for each trajectory in thelattice.
The best trajectory is chosen.The next phase consists in aligning the tree withthat trajectory, using "sure" links as the point ofdeparture, and constraints on the STREE andSNODE liaisons: if there are crossing links, whichis possible if two words in the text have similarmeanings, preference is given to the linkmaximizing the proximity in the tree and in thestring.
Then, liaisons of other types are established:2http://www-clips.imag.fr/geta/User/wang-ju.tsai/welcome.htmllexemes with semantic relations, lexemes withattributes, and MS attributes with attributes.3.3 Related researchSending feedback automatically to developers isalready done in some MT systems, notably inTaiwan (EKS) and at PAHO [14], but should bemuch more used than it is.
The idea of coedition isalso not new: UPM in Madrid uses it to create UNLgraphs, Y. Lepage at ATR and Tang E. K. at USM(Penang)  have developed editors of string-treecorrespondences, Watanabe at IBM-Japan has avery nice interface to edit from a text its underlyingdependency structure, the MULTIMETEO system[8] is in effect a coedition system for weatherforecasts and their underlying semantic structure, in6 languages, and there is a project at Xerox workingon multilingual generation and free textnormalization in restricted domains and typologies(pharmaceutical notices).In our case, by contrast, coedition is to happen atthe consumer side, not (like at UPM) at the produ-cer side, and there is no specific domain ortypology.
The idea to derive an abstract semantictree from an IL representation using alignmenttechniques and not a rule system embedded in agenerator seems also to be new.ConclusionCoedition of a natural language text and itsrepresentation in some interlingual form seems thebest way to share text revision across languages.UNL graphs seem to be the best candidates in thiscontext.
We have described an approach where, inthe simplest sharing scenario, naive users interactdirectly with the text in their language (L0), andindirectly with the associated graph.
It should alsobe possible to view and directly manipulate thegiven UNL graph, a lattice or chart produced bysome available free morphosyntactic analyzer, andan abstract tree produced not by analysis, but by astandard transformation from the UNL graph,followed by lexical enrichment in L0, andalignment with the text.
When completed, ourimplementation will make it possible to sharerevision across languages.
We will then haveprogressed towards merging pivot MT, interactiveMT, and multilingual text authoring.References[1] Al Assimi A.-B.
