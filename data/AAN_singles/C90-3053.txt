IntroductionThis p.qper deals with a general phenomenon of (machine)translation.
The same real situation is often expressed i f ferent lyin d i f ferent languages.
This is especially true for situationswhich are expressed by prepositions.
We hold that di f ferentusage patterns resulting from this fact are due  to di f ferentconceptualizations of the same real situation.
The motivationfor this phenomenon is given by the theory of CognitiveGrammar:  Proceeding from the hypothesis of basic cogni t ivedomains  (cf.
Langacker 1988.pp.54) it is possible to define alland only the properties which nmy become salient in spatialconceptualizations of entities and tht,s distinguish suff ic ientlyone spatial conceptualization from another.
Basic cognitivedomains refer to basic cognitive capacities as, e,g., the ability toconceptualize space and time.
They are bas ic ,  because in anyhierarchy schematizing conceptual complexity they constitutethe lowest level and thereby the range of the conceptualcomplexity.
They are the most general cognitive capacities andare f ixed in certain sonsomotorie as well as logical schemata, andas we have said, in some languages of tim world they aremorphological ly manifested.
This is in line with ontologies basedon prototype semantics, as they have been developed byDahlgren (1986,1989), Hobbs (1987), Moens (1989)), Miller &Johnson-La i rd  (1976) for  word  sense d isambiguat ion  ind i f ferent  NLP systems.
A hierarchy of semantic sorts is def inedover  bas ic  cogn i t ive  domains ,  wh ich  is used for  lexicalrepresentation, thus facil itating transfer (cf.
Zel insky-Wibbelt1988, 1989).
We design a semantic interpretation process forspatial relations in which our translation system uses semanticfeatures  der ived  f rom the semant ic  sort  h ie rarchy .
Theimplementat ion  of  this in terpretat ion  process  is based onassumptions about the cognitive process of conf igur ing spatiallys ignif icant entities by operating on conceptual representations ofword meanings.
The EUROTRA-D CAT2 system shows thatwith the definit ion of word meanings with respect to cognit ivedomains,  we can interpret subtle distinctions between spatiallys ignif icant conf igurat ions in an econmnic and elegant way.2.
Schematlzatlon as the spatial organization of entitiesThe main point we want to illustrate with the translation ofprepositions is how certain circumstances and purposes of anutterance instantiate intportant principles of conceptualization.We will consider part icularly pragmatic factors resulting f romthe specif ic environment of the language and the situation ofutterance; we will investigate how these pragmatic factorsdetermine the relevance, salience and typicality of the entitiesconstituting the conceived situation.
Moreover, we considerthese moan ing  const i tu t ing  factors  wh ich  depend on thecu l ture -spec i f i c  env i ronment  of  the language user to beconceptual motivations of meaning in the broadest sense, namelyin the sense that abstract situations, which may not be perceivedsensorically are conceived in terms of concrete, sensoricallyperce ivab le  s i tuat ions .
Th is  perceptua l ly  d r ivenconceptualization of abstract scenes, by which metaphors arecreated and interpreted, cannot, however, be considered in thispaper (We deal with this phenomenon in Zelinsky-Wibbelt1989b and Zelinsky-Wibbelt forthcoming).P repos i t ions  are cal led re lat iona l  express ions  because theyexpress how the conceptualizer profiles the relation between twoparticipants: between the moving of moveable lrajeetor, usuallyreferred to by the NP mentioned first, and the more stationarybackgrouttded landmark,  usually referred to by the second NP.In this assymetrical partit ioning of the real scene, the relationbetween trajector and landmark is profi led in that the trajectoris located with respect o tbe landmark.
The asymmetric relationbetween trajector and landmark becomes obvious when we tryto turn the relationship around as in the following examples:Tile cat is on tile mat.
/~'The mat is t~nder the cat.Industry is situated on tile Rh ine .
/ 'The  Rhine is situatedon industry.Assuming that language does not express reality but bow weconce ive  of reality, tile semantic distinctions made by languagewith respect to our spatial environment do not necessarily agreewith the entity's real spatial extension, but with its conceptualsehemat izat ion .
Schematization is the fundamental principleunderlying the linguistic expressions of spatial configurations(cf.
Talmy 1983:225).
It is the selection of those propertieswhich become salient with the conceptualization of a scene,while the non-sal ient properties do not participate in thisprocess.
This means that in addition to prepositions being highlypolysemons, most entities are Ioxically vague with respect totheir possible spatial properties which they may realize in therespective configurations.The process of schematization is led by the following relatedprinciples which iustantiate certain spatial properties:- By the salience principle we prefer to associate an entitywith a certain shape of one of its parts in a givenrelation.
For instance in the conceptualization of thesentence "lhe children are riding o,r the bus" "bus" doesnot  re fer  to the  who le  ent i ty ,  wh ich  isthree-dlmensional,  but only to its two-dimensional floor.This becomes salient by the typical relation assumedbetween the entities, which implies the localization ofthe trajector within the space occupied by the landmark(p lace=(t r=par t  of  Im)).
This is an example  ofIDEALIZATION by which we focus on the sa l ientd imens ion(s )  of  an ent i ty  and abst ract  f rom thenon-sa l ient  d imens ions ,  in this case the vert ica ldimension.
The INTRINSIC ORIENTATION of "bus", which isFRONTAL, iS also abstracted away from in this example;within this relation it is salient that the bus has aninterior bottom which functions as a SURFACE.1 299The relevance principle implies that dependent on thecommunicative goals we can choose one of disjointprepositions for a specific spatial configuration.
Thecommunicative goals depend on the speaker's viewpoint,which in turn depends on the situation of utterance.
Thefollowing example might illustrate this principle: Imaginea scene in which Mary is inside the building of asupermarket.
If the speaker is far away from the scenehe would designate Mary's location by saying "Mary is atthe supermarket', thus expressing that his idealization ofthe three-dimensional extension of the supermarket to apoint: by using the preposition "at" he asserts ttmt Mary'sposition coincides with that of the supermarket.
If thespeaker, however, is himsetf on the premises of thesupermarket, he would designate Mary's location bysaying "Mary is in the supermarket" thus referring to thethree-d imens iona l  extension of the bu i ld ing of thesupermarket  funct ion ing  as an ENCLOSURE.
Thusd i f fe rent  utterance s i tuat ions result  in d i s jo in tconceptualizations and hence different expressions of thesame real situation.The tolerance principle controls the pragmatic onditionsunder which expressions chosen by the speaker areadequate.
This pr inc ip le  may for instance contro lwhether idealization of trajector and landmark to apoint, as in the above given example, is adequate withrespect to the specific position of the speaker.
Thetolerance principle also controls the specific range ofPLASTICITY o f  a relation.
PLASTICITY is the generalpossibility of stretching the boundaries of a spatialschematization type with respect o the range of possiblescenes conforming to it.
Thus "in front of" may be usedeven if the located entity is not exactly in front of butalso beside another entity (of.
Herskovits 1988), asindicated in the following schema, where by focaladjustment we may view X to be located in front of Ywithin the given orientation:FrontXBackX is located in/rent el  YDiscourse situationThe discourse situation may beprovided by the verbal predicateof the sentence.Tile typ ica l i ty  pr inc ip le  implies the designation of aspatial configuration in dependance of typical relationsexisting between the entities.
In our example "Thechildren are riding on the bus*, the motion verb impliesthe discourse situation which instantiates the typicalrelation to be that the children are located inside of thebus and not on top of it.The typ ica l i ty  pr inc ip le  also makes possible thein terpreta t ion  of an ent i ty 's  INTRINSIC or TYPICALorientation as the default case, if information to thecontrary  is lack ing.
For instance,  human bodies,churches and other buildings have an intrinsic frontalorientation and a prominent vertical axis.Other properties by which we can distinguish different spatialconfigurations arethe BOUNDARY CONDIT IONS of an ent i ty ,  inc lud ingwhether it is COUNT or MASS, but they may also berelated to the SHAPE properties; that is, it may be ofimportance whether an ENCLOSURE is BOUNDED like asuitcase, PARTIALLY BOUNDED llke a bowl, or UNBOUNDEDlike an area.
Moreover, the BOUNDARy CONDITIONI\] implywhether the entity is temporally UNBOUNDED like aSTATE or  an  ACTIVITY or temporally BOUNDED l ike anACHIEVEMENT or an ACCOMPLISHMENT (cf.
Vendler 1967and Dowty 1979 for th is  c lass i f icat ion;  for theexplication of the spatio-temporal nalogy cf.
e.g.
Talmy1983:pp.255).The GRANULARITY of an entity.
This refers to an entity'ssubdivision, which may be conceptualized with a morefinegrained or more coarsegrained resotution.The process of schematization results in the asymmetric relationbetween trajector and landmark.
This means that prepositionsare two-place predicates (which is an old assumption of formalsemantics; of.
also Hawkins 1985.61).
The relational concept -the t ra jec tor ' s  spat ia l  d ispos i t ion  - is des ignated by thepreposition.Let us now organize the relations developing between trajeetorand landmark with respect o how they condition each other andhow they result from the relevance, salience, and typicality ofthe entities constituting the conceived situation.
This will be theprecondition for implementing these relations in the form ofrules in our translation system.
In figure 1 we represent hoserelations which we assume to determine obligatorily the processof coneeptuallzing the spatial configuration of entities.
We startwith the relational concept which is part of the interpretation ofthe source language and which keeps constant during translation.Universal relation/An interllngually constant PLACE relation is pre- \[supposed that implies the global space in whichthe trajector is localized with respect o thelandmark.~ an__aa laodmar____~kurse situation instantiatesI eertaln spatial properties of trnjeetorland landmark.\] As a consequence of the spatial properties of II trajector and landmark the language specific II relation is conceptualized.
\[300Figure I Conceptualizing the spatial configuration of entities2Discourse situationThe verb provides the discoursesituation by predicating a motion.Landmark (the bus)As the sentence is about MOTION, with tilePLACE of the trajector within tile space _ -of the landmark, tile bus has the normal , -typic'd function of a LAROI'I VEIIIf3L}~;together with this the SUR',~'ACE of thefloor become salient.Universal relation"I'he relation PLACE=(tr=part of Ira}is presupposed.Trajector (the children)Depending on the situation of MOTION, with thetrajeetor within the space of the landmark, and tilenormal VEIIICLI~ function of the bus being salient,the TRANSPORTABILITY of the children is tiletypical property ill this relation.VLanguage specific relation (o~t)The salient part of the landmark being theSURFACE of its floor and tile typical propertyof the trajector being its TRANSPORTABII, ITY,the relation of support is conceptua l i zed.Figure 2 lnstantiation of the spatial properties of children and busLet us now exempli fy how these properties and relations getirrstantiat~,d with an English speaker's conceptualization of ourexample sentence "The children are ridhtg Oil tire bl*s" on tilebasis of  the German source sentence, in f igure 2 we give anoverview of this.In the conf igurat ion of the designated spatial scetle "the bus"establishes tile landmark.
Its spatial conceptualization is thecond i t ion  for  the re la t iona l  concept  des ignated  by "o~t":Depending on the action of "riding" and tile TYPICAL FUNCTIONOf "bus" being that of a LAI~O~ VElllCLI~, the T~'LANSPORTAnlL1TYbecomes the typical property of the trajcctor, which is realizedby the "chiidrepff' (see rule 9 below): This view of the entitiesexcludes all other schematizations from being possible (e.g., thatin which the chi ldren are on top of the bus).
An additionalcondit ion for this schernatization is the information about thePLACE relation, which keeps constant during translation andwhich implies tile fact that the trajector is located within thespace occupied by the landmark.
In this conf igurat ion theSURFACE of the floor of the bus becomes salient, because it isrelatively large, thus instantiating the relation of SUPPORT to beconceptual ized between "children" and "bu.s" {see rule 11 below).A concel:~tualization where the surroundings become more salienthas to be expressed by the preposition "hd', which designates therelation of INCLUSION as for example in "the customer in tiretaxi".3.
The process of schematizationwithin a unification based environmentOur implementation is done in the CAT2 system (cf.
Sharp1988), an extension of the MT prototype (cf.
Arnold et al 1986)formerly nsed in EUROTRA.
Although dif fer ing primari ly inthe implementation, the basic translation philosophy has beenpreserved.
The translation procedure is stratificational in that itis split up into the translation between several l inguisticallymotivated levels, representing constituency, syntactic functionsand semantic relations.
In this paper we are only concerned withthe semantic level, the Interface Structure (IS), which shouldcontain the semantic information required for transfer, analysisand synthesis.
For a more detailed description of tile currentCAT2 system and the current 1S conception see Sharp 1988,Zel insky-Wibbelt  1988 and 1989, and Steiner et at.
1988.Let us now relate the process of schematizatlon to generating arepresentation by stepwise rule application, where the rulesinclude the instantiations of the schematlzatlon principles givenin section 2 ("st" stands for semantic feature, ";" for disjunction,"pred" for predicate, "arg" for argument,  and "rood" fororodifier).
The language-specif ic semantic representation whichun i f ies  with tile cor rect  p repos i t ion  is generated  in therespect ive  target  language component .
We i l lust rate  thetranslation of our example sentence "Die Kinder fahren irn Bus"into "The chitdretz are riding on the bus".
In order to keep therepresentation clear we give the rules in a very simplif iedversion, containing only the information relevant in this context,namely tile information about the typicality, salience, andrelevance of basic  cogn i t ive  domains  and domain -spec i f i ctypical functions:German lexical rules:(1) (pred,{cat=prep,lu=in,place=(tr=part of hn}).\[*\].Feature co-occurrence rules:(2) (?,{cat=pP,place=m }).\[(pred,(cat=prep,piace=A)),* \].Transfer  rules:(3) (mod,{cat=pp,Place=A)) => (mod,{cat=pp,place=A}).\[*\].English lexical rules:(4) (pred,{cat=n,lu=bus,sf={typieal function=large vehicle}}).\[*\].
(5) (pred,{cat=n,lu=ehild,sf={animate=human}}).\[*\].
(6) (pred,{cat=prep,lu=on,reteva n t=su ppor t)).\[* \].
(7) (pred,(cat=v,iu=rlde,s f=(activity=motion },argJ={sf={animate=human}}}).\[*\].3 0 :'~.
3Feature co-occurrence I'nles:(8) (?,{cat-np,sf=A)).\[(pred,(cat=n.sf~ A }),*\].
(9) (?,(cat=s)).\[(pred,{cat=v,sf={aetivity=motion}}),(argl ,{cat=np,sf={salient=transportable,idealization=three-dimensional))),(mod,(cat=pp,plaee={tr=part_of lm},sf of_ np={salient_shape=surface,idealization=two-dimensional,typical function=large vehicle}}D,*\].
(10) (?
, (cat=pp,sf_of  np=(salient shape=A)D.\[pred,argl ,(arg2,{cat=np,sf=(salient_sbape=A)})l.(1 I) (mod,{cat=pp)).\[(pred,(cat=prep,place=(tr=part of Ira,relevan t=support))).\[(argl .
{cat=np,s f=(typical=transportable})).
(arg2,(cat=np,sf~(sallent shape=surface}})\].Rule (3) guarantees that the information about Pt,ACE.
which ispreserved during translation, is transferred.
Rules (5) to (7) arelexieal rules denoting basic cognitive domains, whereas rule (4)denotes a typical function of a domain-specif ic entity.
Bothknowledge types are used in sentence rule (9), which effects thatin sentences in which the verb inherently predicates a MOTIONand has a PP-Modif ier  with an NP argument whose designatedobiect - the landmark - typically functions as a LARGE VEtIICLE,TRANSpOIt.TABILITY is iastantiated as the salient property of thefirst NP argument of the verb, the trajector.
What can then beinstantiated is the idealization of the PP's NP-argument o aTWO-DIMENSIONAL SURPACE which is its salient part.
Now theschematlzation type may be generated by rule (11).
This rulee f fec ts  that in a spat ia l  conf igurat ion  with a typ ica l lyTIt/.,NSPOItTABLE trajector and a landmark which has a surface asits salient part, the relevant concept relating both trajector andlandmark is that of SUPPORT, which unifies with the lexical rule(6) for the preposition on.The result of the generation process is represented in asimplif ied version in figure 3.4.
