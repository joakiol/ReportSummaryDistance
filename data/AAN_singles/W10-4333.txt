We conducted two experi-ments investigating what type of conver-sations people intuitively understand and interpret as gossip, and whether they could identify three proposed constitu-ents of gossip conversations: third per-son focus, pejorative evaluation and sub-stantiating behavior.
The results show that (1) conversations are very likely to be considered gossip if all elements are present, no intimate relationships exist between the participants, and the person in focus is unambiguous.
(2) Conversa-tions that have at most one gossip ele-ment are not considered gossip.
(3) Con-versations that lack one or two elements or have an ambiguous element lead to inconsistent judgments.
1 Introduction We are interested in creating believable charac-ters, i.e.
?characters that provide the illusion of life?
(Bates, 1994).
Since people engage exten-sively in gossip, such characters also need to be able to understand and engage in gossip in or-der to be believable in some situations.
To en-able characters to engage in gossip, we need a computational model of gossip that can be ap-plied in the authoring of such characters and/or by the characters themselves.
Unfortunately, such a model does not yet exist.
Moreover, there is not yet a clear consensus on how gossip should be defined, and most of the definitions are too vague or too general tobe useful.
Merriam-Webster online dictionary, for example, defines gossip as ?rumor or report of an intimate nature?
and ?chatty talk?, neither of which is specific enough.
What we need is a working definition that (a) matches people?s intuitive notion of gossip to the extent possible, given that the notion itself is somewhat vague, and (b) is sufficiently precise to provide a basis for computational implementation.
More recent definitions (e.g.
Eder and Enke, 1991; Eggins and Slade, 1997; Hallett et al, 2009) have been derived from analyzing tran-scriptions of real gossip conversations.
These definitions have only minor individual differ-ences and can in essence be formulated as ?evaluative talk about an absent third person?.
We have chosen to use this definition as a start-ing point since it currently is the most specific one and since it is based on the observed struc-ture of naturally occurring gossip conversa-tions.
This paper reports the results from two ex-periments on gossip conversations.
The first experiment aimed at investigating what type of conversations people intuitively perceive as gossip.
In the second study we also wanted to find out whether the subjects would accept a given definition and could apply it by identify-ing three specified gossip elements.
The paper is structured as follows.
In sec-tion 2 we give a background to gossip with re-spect to both its social function as well as its conversational structure.
Section 3 introduces the experimental method.
In sections 4 and 5 we present the two experiments and discuss the results.
In section 6, finally, we give some final remarks and suggestions for future work.
2 Background Gossip has been described as a mechanism for social control (e.g.
Gluckman, 1963; Fine and Rosnow, 1978; Bergmann, 1993; Eggins and193Slade, 1997) that maintains ?the unity, morals and values of social groups?
(Gluckman, 1963).
It has furthermore been suggested that gossip is a form of ?information-management?, primar-ily to improve one?s self-image and ?protect individual interests?
(Paine, 1967), but also to influence others (Szwed, 1966; Fine and Ros-now, 1978).
Gossip can furthermore be viewed as a form of entertainment (Abrahams, 1970) ?
?a satisfying diversion from the tedium of rou-tine activities?
(Fine and Rosnow, 1978:164).
Recent studies have used a sociological ap-proach focusing on analyzing the structure of gossip conversations (e.g.
Bergmann, 1993; Eder and Enke, 1991; Eggins and Slade, 1997; Hallett et al, 2009).
Rather than observing and interviewing people in a certain community about their gossip behavior, they have analyzed transcripts of naturally occurring gossip con-versations.
Their studies show that gossipers collaborate in creating the gossip, making it a highly interactive genre.
They also identified two key elements of gossip:  ?
Third person focus ?
the identification of an absent third person that is ac-quainted with, but emotionally disjoint from the other participants (Bergmann (1993) refers to this as being ?virtually?
absent, while Goodwin (1980) labels it ?symbolically?
absent).
?
An evaluation of the person in focus or of his or her behavior.
Eggins and Slade (1997) propose that the evaluation necessarily is pejorative to separate gos-sip from other types of chat.
Hallett et al (2009) found that the gossipers often use implicit evaluations to conceal the critique, suggesting that the gossipers either speak in general terms about something that implicitly is understood to be about a certain person, or that the gossipers avoid evaluating the behavior under the assumption that the evaluation is implicit in the behavior itself.
In-stead of specifying the evaluation as being pe-jorative, they say it is ?unsanctioned?.
In addition to the two elements described above, Eggins and Slade (1997) propose a third obligatory element: ?
Substantiating behavior ?
An elabora-tion of the deviant behavior that can ei-ther be used as a motivation for the nega-tive evaluation, or as a way to introduce gossip in the conversation.
Eder andEnke (1991) use a different model, but the substantiating behavior component corresponds roughly to their optional Explanation act.
There seems to be a consensus that gossip conversations have third person focus.
The question is whether a gossip conversation nec-essarily has both a substantiating behavior component as well as a pejorative evaluation component, and if they do, can they be identi-fied?
In the experiments presented later in this paper, we hope to shed light on whether these components are necessary or not.
3 Method  During the fall 2009, we conducted two ex-periments about gossip conversations.
The aim of the experiments was to verify to what extent the definition of gossip accords with intuitive recognition of gossip episodes, and secondly whether people could reliably identify constitu-ent elements.
The data was collected using online ques-tionnaires1 that were distributed through differ-ent email-lists mainly targeting researchers and students within game design, language technol-ogy, and related fields, located primarily in North America and Europe.
The questionnaires had the following structure: The first page con-sisted of an introduction, including instructions, and each page thereafter had a dialogue excerpt retrieved from a screenplay followed by the question and/or task.
3.1 Hypotheses  Based on the previous studies presented earlier (in particular Bergmann, 1993; Eder and Enke, 1991; and Eggins and Slade, 1997) we had the following hypotheses: ?
The more gossip elements present in the text, the more likely the conversation will be considered gossip.
?
Third person focus is a necessary (but not sufficient) element of gossip.
?
Conversations in which the participants (including the target) are intimately re-lated will be rated lower than those in which all participants are emotionally separated.
1 Created using http://www.surveygizmo.com/1944 Experiment I: Identifying gossip text The aim of the first experiment was to investi-gate how people intuitively understand and in-terpret gossip conversations.
4.1 Material and procedure  The questionnaire contained 16 different dia-logue excerpts retrieved from transcripts of the famous sitcoms Desperate Housewives 2  and Seinfeld3.
The excerpts were selected to cover different combinations of the elements pre-sented in the previous section (third person fo-cus, an evaluation, and a motivation for the evaluation), as in the following dialogue4: B:  Tisha.
Tisha.
Oh, I can tell by that look on your face you?ve got something good.
Now, come on, don?t be selfish.
T:  Well, first off, you?re not friends with Maisy Gibbons, are you?
B:  No.
T:  Thank god, because this is too good.
Maisy was arrested.
While Harold was at work, she was having sex with men in her house for money.
Can you imagine?
B:  No, I can?t.
T:  And that?s not even the best part.
Word is, she had a little black book with all her clients?
names.
R:  So, uh ?
you think that?ll get out?
T:  Of course.
These things always do.
Nancy, wait up.
I can?t wait to tell you this.
Wait, wait.
A preliminary analysis to determine whether the elements were present or not, was made by the first author.
The instructions contained no information about the elements and no defini-tion was given.
To each excerpt we provided some contextual information, such as the inter-personal relationship between the speakers and other people mentioned in the dialogue, e.g.
: The married couple, Bree (B) and Rex (R) Van de Kamp, is having lunch at the club.
Some women laughing at the next table cause the two of them to turn and look.
One of their acquaintances, Tisha (T), walks away from that table and heads to another one.
Maisy Gibbons is another woman in their neigh-borhood, known to be very dominant and judgmental towards the other women.

4.2 Results  A total of 52 participants completed the ex-periment.
The following table shows the distri-bution of ratings for each of the 16 excerpts (the table is sorted by the mean rating).
Rating distribution ID5 0 1 2 3 Mean rating 11 50 1 1 0 0.058 6 46 5 0 1 0.154 15 33 15 4 0 0.442 2 28 20 4 0 0.538 5 30 15 6 1 0.577 10 17 24 10 1 0.904 9 10 26 13 3 1.173 16 11 17 16 8 1.404 4 8 18 18 8 1.500 14 11 13 11 17 1.654 3 6 20 11 15 1.673 1 1 17 25 9 1.808 13 3 18 17 14 1.808 12 5 9 15 23 2.077 8 3 0 11 38 2.615 7 1 2 4 45 2.788  Table 1: Gossip ratings of all 16 questions sorted by their mean value.
It is apparent from the table that a few ex-cerpts are clearly gossip or clearly not gossip, but there is much disagreement on other ex-cerpts.
Inter-rater reliability is ?
= 0.437: well above chance, but not particularly high6.
Only 7 of the 16 excerpts (ID #2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 15) were clearly rated as gossip or not gossip by more than half of the subjects, and only 5 of those have a mean rating below 0.5 or above 2.5.
5 Presentation was ordered by ID, same for all subjects.
6 The reported value is Krippendorff?s ?
with the interval distance metric (Krippendorff 1980).
Interval ?
is defined as 1 ?
Do/De, where Do (observed disagreement) is twice the mean variance of the individual item ratings, and De (expected disagreement) is twice the variance of all the ratings.
For the above table, Do = 1.327 and De = 2.585.195Despite the apparently low agreement, the results correspond fairly well with our expecta-tions.
The 3 excerpts with a mean value below 0.5 had no gossip elements at all and the other two excerpts with a median value of 0 had only one gossip element.
Similarly, the two excerpts rated highest clearly had all gossip elements.
The rest of the excerpts, however, either lacked one element or had one element that was un-clear in some regard (see discussion, below).
Conversations between family members or partners also caused higher disagreements, which seem to support Bergmann?s (1993) re-mark: ?[?]
we can ask whether we should call gossip the conversations between spouses [?]
alone.
This surely is a borderline case for which there is no single answer?
(p. 68).
4.3 Discussion  Among the nine excerpts with a mean value approximately between 1 and 2 (ID #1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 16), we made the following observations: 3 excerpts lacked one element; in 2 of them, the gossipers were family members or partners; 3 excerpts had an ambiguous focus, among which one also possibly was perceived as a warning.
By ?ambiguous focus?
we mean that it is un-clear whether the person in focus is the speaker, the addressee or the absent third person.
In-stead, the absent third person seems to play a sub-ordinate role rather than focused role, for instance as part of a self-disclosure or a con-frontation.
If the conversation is the least bit confrontational, the addressee tends to go into defense rather than choosing a more typical gossip response, such as support, expansion, or challenge (Eder and Enke, 1991) in order to protect the face.
Hence, no ?gossip fuel?
is added to the conversation.
The result of the remaining excerpt7 is how-ever more difficult to explain.
One possible explanation is that the initiator was unac-quainted with the target, but perhaps more likely is that some of the subjects interpreted the conversation as mocking rather than gossip:  E: Who?s that?
D:  That?s Sam, the new girl in accounting.
W: What?s with her arms?
They just hang like salamis.
D:  She walks like orangutan.
E:  Better call the zoo.

From Seinfeld, Castle Rock Entertainment.5 Experiment II: Identifying gossip elements in a text The aim of the second experiment was to inves-tigate whether the subjects could accept and apply a given definition by identifying the three obligatory elements of gossip according to Eggins and Slade (1997) (see section 2); third person focus, pejorative evaluation, and sub-stantiating behavior.
In addition to the ele-ments, we provided the more general definition presented in section 1 (?evaluative talk about an absent third person?).
The results from the first experiment indi-cated that conversations that seemingly had all the elements but in which the person in focus was ambiguous, received a lower gossip rating than those having an unambiguous third person focus.
So an additional goal was to investigate whether changing the relationship between the participants would affect the gossip rating.
5.1 Material  We used excerpts from Seinfeld8, Desperate Housewives 9 , Legally blonde 10 , and Mean girls11.
In total we selected 21 excerpts, of which 8 also occurred in the first experiment.
Two of the recurring excerpts were used both in their original versions as well as in modified versions, in which we had removed the emo-tional connections between the participants.
The purpose of this was to find out whether changing the interpersonal relationship would change the gossip rating.
5.2 Procedure The subjects were instructed to read the ex-cerpts and then identify the gossip elements according to the following description: ?
The person being talked about (third per-son focus) ?
the ?target?, e.g.
?Maisy Gibbons was arrested?
?
Pejorative evaluation.
A judgment of the target him-/herself or of the target?s be-havior.
This evaluation is in most cases negative, e.g.
?She?s a slut?, ?He?s weird?

The deviant behavior that motivates the gossip and provides evidence for the judgment (also called the substantiating behavior stage), e.g.
?Maisy Gibbons was arrested?
For each element they found, they were asked to specify the corresponding line refer-ence as given in the text.
They were also in-structed to say whether they considered the conversation to be gossip or not gossip.
If their rating disagreed with the definition, i.e.
if they had found all the elements but still rated the conversation as not gossip, or if one or more elements were lacking but the conversation was considered gossip anyway, they were asked to specify why.
5.3 Results We analyzed the results from the 19 subjects who completed ratings for all 21 excerpts.
This gave a total of 399 yes/no judgments on 4 at-tributes.
Inter-coder reliability 12  is shown in Table 2.
The easiest attribute to interpret is third person focus.
All but three of the subjects marked either 4 or 5 excerpts as not having third person focus, with the remaining subjects not deviating by much (marking 3, 6, and 7 excerpts).
Moreover, the subjects agree on which excerpts have third person focus: only one excerpt gets a substantial number of con-flicting ratings (see the analysis given below in section 5.4), while the remaining 20 excerpts get consistent ratings from all subjects with only occasional deviation by one or two of the deviant subjects.
This accounts for the high observed agreement on this feature (94.9%).
Expected agreement is high because the corpus is not balanced (16 of 21 excerpts display third person focus), but even so, chance-corrected agreement is high (85.1%), showing that third person focus is an attribute that participants can readily and reliably identify.
The remaining attributes, including gossip, are less clear.
Agreement on all of them is clearly above chance, but is not particularly high, showing that these notions are either not fully defined, or that the excerpts are ambigu-ous.
Gossip itself is identified somewhat more reliably than either substantiating behavior or pejorative evaluation; this casts doubt about the ability to use the latter two as defining features                                                  12 We used Krippendorff's alpha with the nominal dis-tance metric.

To test the relationship between the various features, we looked for co-occurrences among the individual judgments.
We have a total of 399 ratings (21 excerpts times 19 judges), each with 4 attributes; these are distributed as shown in Table 313.
We can see that third person focus is an almost necessary condition for classifying a screenplay conversation as gossip, though it is by no means sufficient.
Tables 4?6 show the co-occurrences of individual features to gossip; the association is strongest between gossip and third person focus and weakest between gossip and pejorative evaluation.

Table 8 shows the correlation between gos-sip and each of the other three features.
The first column calculates correlation based on the individual judgments (399 items, each score is either 0 or 1); the second column calculates correlation based on the rated excerpts (21 items, each score is an integer between 0 and 19, as in table 7); and the third column groups the judgments by subject (19 items, each score is an integer between 0 and 21, indicating the number of dialogues in which the subject iden-tified the particular feature; the full data are not shown).

All the correlations are significantly different from 0 at the p ?
0.05 level or greater.
The dif-ferences between the columns are not signifi-cant, except for the difference between the third person correlation by individuals and that by excerpt, which is significant at p ?
0.05.
The correlations between the features on the indi-vidual judgments show that subjects tend to identify the different features together; this may be partly a reflection of awareness on their part that the features are expected to go together, given the task definition.
The correlations be-tween the excerpt scores show that the excerpts themselves differ along the four dimensions, and these differences go hand in hand.
Finally, we see that the subjects themselves differ in how often they identify the different features, though the correlations are likely to be just a reflection of the first tendency identified above, to mark the features together.
5.4 Discussion We wanted to find out whether the subjects would accept, understand and be able to apply a given definition.
The results from the experi-ment showed that the subjects accepted the given definition to some extent and managed to apply it.
When the subjects disagreed they were asked to say why.
One of the subjects, for ex-ample, explicitly disagreed with the definition given in the introduction and provided a counter definition: ?Gossip is idle talk or ru-mor, especially about the personal or private affairs of others?.
Yet another subject was un-certain about which definition to use: ?Depends what you mean by gossip.
It can either mean malicious, behind the back talk of other people or idle chat.
If you mean ?idle chat?
with gos-sip then this is also gossip?.
A possible expla-nation could be that the subjects refer to differ-ent forms of gossip (see e.g.
Gilmore, 1978) and therefore apply different definitions (such as the lexical definition presented earlier) than the one that was given in the experiment.198Several subjects stated that they judged the conversation as gossip even if they did not identify any pejorative evaluation, and they also questioned whether the evaluation had to be negative or even present at all, or as one of the subjects put it: ?Although there is no pejo-rative evaluation (at least not clearly) I believe this is gossip?.
These subjects thus explicitly reject Eggins and Slade?s (1997) requirement that the evaluation has to be pejorative.
The examples above show that people have variable intuitions of gossip and consequently the concept of gossip is somewhat vague.
Even so, the experiment also showed that people to a large degree are in agreement when the exam-ples according to the given definition clearly are gossip or not gossip.
Meaning that even though the definition does not capture all types of (potential) gossip conversations, it captures those episodes that most people agree to be gossip, which for our purpose is sufficient.
5.5 Effect of interpersonal relations In some particular cases, the subjects did not choose gossip even if all elements had been found.
The results from the first experiment indicated that this deviation either was related to the interpersonal relationship between the gossip participants or that the focus was am-biguous.
In order to test whether changing the inter-personal relationship between the partici-pants would change the gossip rating, we com-pared the results from the conversations we had modified with their original counterparts.
In one of the original excerpts, the addressee was romantically involved with the man that the speaker was talking about.
The speaker formu-lated the negative assessment and deviant be-havior in a way that for most people would be interpreted as a warning, which probably ex-plains why only 7 of the 19 subjects rated the original conversation as gossip.
The modified version on the other hand, was rated as gossip by all subjects.
In the second dialogue, the speaker questions the addressee?s choice of person to date, and does this by both evaluating the person nega-tively as well as providing evidence for the evaluation.
It turns out, however, that the ad-dressee thinks she is going out for a date with someone else, so a large part of the conversa-tion deals with trying to identify the target.
15 of 19 subjects rated the original conversation as gossip, while all subjects rated it as gossip in the modified version.
These comparisons indi-cate that the status of the relationship between the gossipers and the gossip target affects whether the dialogue is considered gossip or not.
In the original version of both these exam-ples, the focus was ambiguous, i.e.
the focus was as much on the addressee as on the absent third person.
We have shown that third person focus is a key element of gossip.
The correlation was fur-thermore confirmed by the subjects themselves in their comments, where the lack of third per-son often was listed as a reason for not choos-ing gossip.
In one example, the respondent re-garded the conversation as gossip even if it really was an insult directed towards the ad-dressee, but explained it as its ?
?almost like he?s forgotten he?s talking to the person he?s giving this opinion/gossip about?.
The highest disagreement concerning third person focus was found in the following ex-cerpt15: Karen: Okay, what is it?
Gretchen: Regina says everyone hates you because you?re such a slut.
Karen: She said that?
Gretchen: You didn?t hear it from me.
The dialogue contains an ambiguous focus in that it both includes a quote as well as a con-frontational insult.
By using the third person reference, Gretchen avoids taking responsibility for the insult.
In some sense both Karen and Regina are in focus, where Karen is the target of the pejorative evaluation and Regina can be interpreted as being the focus of the substantiat-ing behavior component.
How Regina?s role is interpreted is determined by the respondents?
personal attitude towards gossiping in general (i.e.
whether they interpret Gretchen?s utterance as containing an implicit evaluation of Regina?s behavior or not), and how they perceive the interpersonal relationship between Karen and Gretchen.
Gossip has an inherent contradiction in that it both has a function of negotiating the accepted way to behave while it at the same time often is considered an inappropriate activ-ity that can have serious negative consequences for both the gossipers as well as the gossip tar-get (see e.g.
Gilmore, 1978; Bergmann, 1993; Eggins and Slade, 1997; Hallett et al, 2009).
15 From Mean Girls, Paramount Pictures, 2004.1996 Final remarks and future work The aim of these studies has been to get a workable definition of gossip that people can agree upon and that is sufficiently precise to provide a basis for computational implementa-tion.
We conducted two experiments to investi-gate people?s intuitive notion of gossip and the results show that (1) conversations in which all elements are present, where no intimate rela-tionships exist between the participants, and in which the person in focus is unambiguous, are very likely to be considered gossip.
(2) Conver-sations that have at most one gossip element are not considered gossip.
(3) Inconsistencies are mainly found in conversations that lack one or two elements or have at least one element that is ambiguous, or are taking place between gossipers that have an intimate relationship.
We have suggested that third person focus is a necessary, but not sufficient, element of gos-sip, but the other elements are less clear even if their co-occurrence in a conversation clearly affects the gossip score.
In the second experi-ment this might be due to the instructions, but it does not explain the unbiased results from the first experiment.
So on the one hand we can clearly see that all three elements are important for the understanding of gossip, but on the other hand, the subjects?
had trouble in identi-fying them.
This suggests that we need to fur-ther investigate these elements to see how they can be specified more clearly.
We have taken a first step toward a computa-tional account of gossip, by empirically verify-ing the extent to which the given definition can be applied and the components recognized by people.
Some of our next steps to further this program include authoring content for believ-able characters that follow this definition, as well as attempting to automatically recognize these elements.
Among the possible applications of gossip we can think of game characters and virtual humans that are capable of engaging in gossip conversations to share information and create social bonds with a human user or its avatar.
This involves being able to both generate gos-sip on basis of the interpersonal relationship and selecting content that could be regarded as gossip, as well as to automatically detect gossip occurring in a conversation.
The latter use could also be used for characters that activelywant to avoid taking part in gossip conversa-tions.
