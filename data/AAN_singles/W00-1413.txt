This question has receivedmuch attention in cognitive modelling and notas much in other branches of NLG.
This pa-per describes the various approaches taken, dis-cusses the reasons why they are so different, andargues that production models using symbolicrepresentations should make a distinction be-tween conceptual nd lexical hierarchies, whichcan be organized along fixed levels as studied in(some branches of) lexical semantics.1 In t roduct ionRepresentations used in language processingowe much to the tradition of 'semantic net-works', which nowadays have been successfullyformalized and organized especially around oneparticular kind of link between odes: the ISA-link, which connects entities to subordinate en-tities.
This link is, by definition, the root ofthe so-called 'hyperonym 1 problem': When aspeaker utters a word, she presumably needsto retrieve a lemma from her mental lexicon,and the 'applicability conditions" of the lemmaautomatically render the lemma's hyperonymsalso applicable, thus raising the question howthe choice among a set of more or less specificwords is made.In this paper, I briefly review approachesto the hyperonym problem in psycholinguis-tics, natural language generation, and lexicalsemantics.
In doing that, I will refer to differ-ent branches of NLG according to their rootsI Alternatively called 'hypernym' in many publica-tions: 'hyperonym" seems preferable, as the Greek rootis 'hyper" (super) + 'onoma'  (name).. .

.and main motivations.
Generally acknowl-edged are the two poles of 'cognition-inspired'and 'engineering-inspired' language production:Cognition-inspired work (CI-NLG, for short)seeks to build models that replicate perfor-mance data and explain phenomena of humanlanguage production with the help of psycholog-ical experiments; engineering-inspired work (EI-NLG) seeks to build programs that provide lin-guistic output to some particular computer ap-plication.
These goals are extremely different,and it seems that the gap between the respec-tive methodologies will persist for quite sometime.
In between the two, however, I wouldsituate a third category, which may be called'linguistics-inspired'.
For this branch, here ab-breviated as LI-NLG, the primary motivationis neither in modelling human performance norin efficiently performing a technical application;rather, LI-NLG seeks production models thatreplicate 'competence data', i.e.
that account forobserved linguistic regularities, without con>miting to statements about the human produc-tion p~vcess.Arguing that progress hinges on a better un-derstanding of the structure of the mental vo-cabulary, which includes a clear picture of thenature of the ISA-link, I will sketch a frameworkof distinct (but related) conceptual and lexicalhierarchies, which offers possibilities to accountfor at least some of the phenomena to be dis-cussed.2 The  hyperonym prob lemFollowing tile psycholinguistics literature, thehyperonym problem is regarded as all aspect oflemrna retrieval.
Roelofs \[1996, p. 308\] describesa 'lemma' as a representation f the meaningand the syntactic properties of a word, and thetask of lemma retrieval as a crucial step in the93process of grammatical encoding, where build- situations of utterance.

For thepsycholinguist, the~geneya~!_.prgb!em is  that ofconvergence from an under-specified conceptualrepresentation to one word that the speaker ut-ters.
Levelt \[1989, p. 20I\] characterizes the hy-peronym problem:"There is one particularly nasty con-vergence problem that has not beensolved by any theory of lexical access.l will call it the hyperonym problem\[...\]: When lemma A's meaning entailslemma B's meaning, B is a hyperonymof A.
If A's conceptual conditions aremet, then B's are necessarily also satis-fied.
Hence, if A is the correct lemma,B will (also) be retrieved.
"The relation of hyperonymy is generally re-garded as transitive: If A is a hyperonym ofB, and B is a hyperonym of C, then A is a hy-peronym of C. Following common practice, wecall A a direct hyperonym of B, while it is onlyan indirect hyperonym of C. The same holds forthe inverse relation, hyponymy.For CI-NLG, which is concerned with find-ing models that resolve the convergence prob-lem with the impressive speed displayed by hu-man speakers, the hyperonym problem is im-portant because it.
serves to put implementedmodels of spreading activation to the test.
ForEI-NLG.
on the other hand, it can usually beignored, as most of today's practical applica-tions either do not require the production of amore general word (i.e.. there is a one-to-onemapping from concept to word) or can rely onfairly simple mechanisms that.,avoid ,lexical rep-etitions bv choosing from a fixed, pre-defined setof near-synonyms.
For LI-NLG, the challengeof the hyperonynl problem is to explain how asentence can be paraphrased by others that re-place a word by a hyperonym, and why speakersselect from candidate hyperonyms in differentrive goals), the task is to find the best candidatefrom a set of valid paraphrases, here especiallyon the grounds of replacing content words withhyperonyms.3 Psycholinguistic product ionmode ls.... Lan gu age' prod n'ction ~m o dels~deve\[oped in- psy:--,cholinguistics are nowadays couched in neuralnetwork theory.
Under debate are the computa-tional properties of the networks, i.e., the modesof activation spreading, tile existence of feed-back, of inhibitory links, etc.
The main method-ological concern is to construct he models insuch a way that they account for data gatheredin human speech production experiments, of-ten involving production errors, which can shedlight on the underlying mechanisms.A central point of content is the ques-tion whether the meaning of concepts and/orwords is represented in a decomposed fashionor not.
Here, the hyperonym problem is some-times used as evidence by proponents of non-decompositional models.
Roelofs \[1996\], for in-stance, argues that if a number of nodes repre-senting semantic features are the basis for lex-ical access, in lemma retrieval it becomes ex-tremely difficult to control the activation spreadin such a way that only the most specific lexicalunit that combines these features gets selected.Roelofs concludes that a non-decompositionalmodel is to be favoured: When lemma retrievalstarts with activation of the 'lexical concept'FATHER, rather than with tile features MALEand PARENT, the output word will be father,without the danger of being outranked by ahigher activation of parent (or person, or entity.presumably).This line is continued in a recent compre-hensive theory of speech production by Lev-elt.

The model consists of three layers ofnodes: A layer of concept nodes with labelledconcept links, a layer of lemma nodes, and alayer of word form nodes that include morpho-94logical information.
When a lexical concept isactivated, the mechanism of activation spread-:ing ensures that ~the::~directly:..ecm:nected::lemma....receives tile highest activation, and not a lemmaassociated with a hyperonym of the lexical con-cept (which is connected by an ISA-link).Working out the mechanics to ensure thisbehaviour is important for the implementa-tion, but from the particular viewpoint of wordchoice, approaches of this kind are not very ex-planatory.
Levelt.
et.al.
:\[1999, ~..~,4\]i istate that"there is not the slightest evidence that speak-ers tend to produce hyperonyms of intendedtarget words."
But when lexical access startswith an appropriately activated lexical concept,the problem is effectively moved away, into therealm of conceptualization.
The authors ac-knowledge the need for a component hat es-tablishes a 'perspective' by selecting a specificset of words, but have not incorporated such acomponent into their model.
Thus, why andhow the lexical concept receives its activation,and where the intention of using a word arisesfrom, is not covered by the theory.
For thesequestions, we have to turn to work in naturallanguage generation.4 Hyperonyms in NLG sys temsIn contrast to psycholinguistics-inspired work,the vast majority of natural language genera-tion systems uses computations based on sym-bol manipulation, often connected with sym-bolic knowledge representation and reasoningtechniques.
In these systems, the hyperonymproblem as one aspect of the general task oflexical choice arises only in systems that em-ploy a sufficiently rich model of the lexicon andtile concept-lexicon link.
involving some sort ofhierarchy information.
As pointed out above,from an application-oriented perspective (i.e..in EI-NLG) it is often sufficient o work withrather limited mechanisms that largely eschewthe lexical choice task.The earliest and very influential device forperforming lexical choice, Goldman's-\[.1.-975\]discr imination net hard-wires the sequence ofchoice points leading to a specific lexical item,which is in fact the general strategy taken in themajority of NLG systems: if you have a choice.then prefer the most specific term.The most substantial criticism on the prefer-the-specific heuristic has been voiced in thework of Reiter \[1991\].
One of his examples:is.
~  system., ~as~zerhlg~:the-N.uestio n .
*Is; .Ter~y:awoman?
Even if the system has the specificknowledge that Terry is a bachelor, the responseNo, Terry is a bachelor would not be appropri-..ate here; the less specific No, Terry is a manis better since it does not prompt the hearer todraw ally conclusions as to tile particular ele-vance of Terry's marital status for the presentLc0:n~ersa, tion, Reiter?s-.
main -pointis:to distin-guish the knowledge a generation system has atits disposal from the communicative goals fol-lowed in producing an utterance.
The latterare explicitly represented in his system as a. listof attributes 'to communicate about an entity',which is a subset of the overall knowledge thesystem has of that entity.
In the Terry-example,the goal is to inform the hearer that Terryhas the attributes {Human, Age-status:adult,Sex:Male}.In the KL-ONE \[Brachman, Schmolze 1985\])style knowledge representation used by Reiter,concepts can be marked as 'basic-level' in thesense of \[Rosch 1978\].
Thus, on the taxonomicpath Tweety (instance-of) Robin - Bird - Ver-tebrate - An imal  - Object, the concept Bird isa basic-level one, which leads to a preferencefor using the corresponding lexical item whenreferring to some kind of bird (i.e., some con-cept or instance subsumed by it).
Simultane-ous to Rosch's work, Cruse \[1977\] (who in turnwas building on earlier research by Roger Brownin tile 1960s) had pointed out that tile failureto use items of "inherently neutral specificity"(a notion that closely corresponds to the basiclevel) results in unwanted conversational impli-ca.tures I tile hearer will surmise the existenceof some reason why the neutra.1 term could notbe used in the specific situation of utterance.But using the basic level is not mandatory.of course.
Given a suitable context where at-tention is directed to particular attributes ofentitities, a speaker moves to a more specificor sometimes to a more ~ general : evel.
~:Reiter'smechanism of to-communicate attributes triesto capture this: Covering these attributes witha suitable term can override the preference forthe basic level.
Other kinds of preferences arealso accounted for, such as favouring shorterrather than longer words, which typically (but95not always) co-incides with the basic-level pref-erence.
Reiter notes that humans also employ.

- some preferences.t:hat can~otbe xplained ~wi,ththe parameters investigated so far.
He givesthe example \[Reiter 1991, p. 248\] of a speakerpointing the hearer to a cow and a horse withthe utterance Look at the animals / mammals /vertebrates, t None of the terms is basic-level orsignigificantly shorter than the others, yet thereis a clear order of-'normality' in the sequence ofthe three candidates.In my own work on lexical choice in  the'Moose' generator \[Stede 1999\], I used language-neutral conceptual hierarchies and the sub-sumption relation, inter alia to account for thefact that different languages occasionally dis-play preferences for different levels of specificity.For example, in hi-lingual instructional text wefind a regular correspondence between the gen-eral English to remove and numerous more spe-cific German lexemes ( abziehen, abnehmen, her-ausdrehen, ...); this might very well be a genre-specific tendency.
Furthermore, Moose employsa model of lexical connotations that can over-ride the general preference for a more specificlexical item.
For example, when referring to aPOODLE in a derogatory manner, Moose canchoose the appropriately connotated word mutt,which requires moving up the taxonomy to theDOG concept, where a range of near-synonyms(differing in their connotations) are attached.Another reason for considering hyperonyms inthe lexical choice process is to avoid repeatedusage of the same term when referring to someobject multiple times.In the present Moose implementation, allmore general words are inherited to the concept-to-be-lexicalized, and the preference mechanismselects one of them (in case of absence of any de-cisive factors, it chooses the most specific word).This mechanism is certainly not cognitively ad-equate (it was not intended to be) and also notparticularly efficient: The range of candidatesunder consideration should be constrained be-forehand.-In conclusion, NLG systems, employ a mix-ture of constraints and preferences in their ap-proaches to hyperonymy.
The factors used byvarious systems in the choice process are:o User's vocabulary and knowledge (e.g..\[Mcl(eown et al 199:\]\]).

It is not clear which generallexical items should be inherited down to theconcept-to-be-lexicMized and enter the prefer-ential choice mechanism; it is also not clear howexactly the various preferences would interactand which would take precedence in a particu-lar situation of utterance.5 Hyperonymy in lex ica l  semant icsLinguists studying lexical semantics are to agood extent concerned with sense relations be-tween words, and hyp(er)onymy is certainly oneof the relations receiving the most attention.While the intuitive decision whether some en-tity is subordinate to some other entity is inmost cases not difficult to make, spelling outthe precise definition of hyponymy (and thushyperonymy) and its consequences is anythingbut trivial.
Lyons \[1977\], for example, proposesthat fish and bird share the direct hyperonymcreature-  but not animal.
That is, when I sayThere were plenty of fish in the creek, tile al-ternative sentence There.
were plenty of animalsin the creek would not be a felicitous utterance.even thougil it is "trutl>conditionally correct".And hence, there is a difference between fishISA creature and fish ISA animal.An interesting distinction in this respect isoffered by Cruse \[1986\], who separates hy-ponymy_ from the more constrained relation .oftaxonym, y.
A diagnosis for the latter is the ut-terance frame X is a kind o f / type  of Y. Exam-pies that "work" in this frame are: spaniel-dog,rose-flou, er, mango-fruit.
Examples that seemnot to work are: kitten-cat, queen-monarch,spinster-woman, u aiter-man.
Notice t hat bot h96groups are perfectly compatible with the ISA-test, though: No one would doubt that a waiterIS A man, a.q-ueen IS A'.monarch.Taxonomies, as Cruse proposes, typicallyhave no more than five levels, and frequentlyhave fewer.
The levels are commonly labelledas 'unique beginner' - 'life form' - 'generic' -'specific' - 'varietal'.

These items tend to be morphologicallysimple and are not metaphorically transferredfrom elsewhere.
Most branches of hierarchiesterminate at the generic level, and hence thisis the level with the largest number of items.Items at specific and varietal evels are particu-larly likely to be morphologically complex, andcompound words are frequent here.From the notion of explicitly defined levels,it follows that hierarchies do not need to havenodes at each level.
Consider the examples infigure 1.
Depending on what items people placeon the generic level, they end up with one of thetwo variants; according to Cruse, most peoplesubscribe to the second, which holds dog, cat,bird on the same, generic level.
Another ex-ample are musical instruments: Most of thembelong to a kind such as strings, woodwind,brass, percussion, but there is no obvious kindfor bagpipes or concertina, which are thus di-rectly linked to musical instrument.Cruse elaborated the importance of thegeneric level in \[Cruse 1977\], where he statesthat for every line of noun taxonomy, there isone term that is 'inherently neutral' (cf.
the no-tion of basic level mentioned above).
There isa general rule that requires speakers to use thisterm in order to obtain an unmarked utterancein a given context:-:-.unless.this would- resultin an 'abnormal communication', in which casethe speaker should deviate from neutral level,but only to the minimum degree required to en-sure normality.
Cruse then offers several condi-tions that would license such over- and under-specification, which we do not reproduce here.kinds of NLG have very different approaches tothe hyperonym problem.
EI-NLG can basicallyignore or finess it.
In CI-NLG, it is reducedto a merely technical question: getting the me-chanics of spreading activation right, so thatlexical convergence enables the subsequent pro-cesses of syntactization and articulation (whichthe CI-NLG models place their emphasis on).A broader view is necessarily based on reason-ing with speaker's goals and contextual features,which for the time being is the realm of LI-NLG.
Thus, before embarking on building morecomprehensive con.nectionist models, the hyper-onym problem is best studied in the frameworksof LI-NLG - -  but with the motivation of mod-elling human performance taken into account.Thus adopting the perspective outlined insection 4, we are interested in choosing wordsbetween more or less specific alternatives as wellas between near-synonyms of the same speci-ficity.
We thereby open the door to both 'ver-tical' and 'horizontal' lexical choice within a hi-erarchy, which raises a number of questions:* What is the granularity of conceptual, andthat of lexical knowledge??

The WordNet chain includesmany items that clearly do not show up in ev-eryday language use, and that a lexical choiceprocess hould prefer not to consider when pro-ducing an utterance about a collie.
Chordate,for example, would in the vast majority of utter-ance situations not be an option.
On tile otherhand, all these terms are certainly 'correct', anda system should be able to respond affirmativelyto the question Is a collie a chordate ?This divergence points to the need for a dis-tinction between conceptuaJ,and lexicalg:ranu-laritv and inheritance: The WordNet chain rep-resents rather a series of concepts than of wordsentering the lexical choice process, which ap-pears to be better represented by a Cruse-typechain with few designated levels (but needs tobe augmented with near-synonyms for tile 'hor-i ng ,  .
