1969 In ternat iona l  Conference on Computat iona l  L inguist ics5emant ica and the Syntact ic  C lass i f i ca t ion  of WordsErnst  von  G lasers fe ld(Georgia Inst i tute for Research,and Univers i ty  of Georgia)(*)In present ing some aspects  of our somewhat unusualgrammar to a gather ing of qomputat iona l  l inguists ,  I feeljust i f ied in taking two things for granted: f irst, thatmost people who have taken an act ive interest  both in com-puters and in natural  language have come to real ise thatcomputers,  a l though impress ive ly  fast and re l iable in manytasks, are not very br i l l iant  when it comas to making in-duct ive decis ions on the basis of insuf f i c ient  or not tho-roughly de f ineddata ;  and, second, that what we l inguistsknow about the work ings of natural  ~anguage is by no meansenough to supply computers,  as they are, with a sol id bas-is for the ful ly automat ic  handl ing of natural - language.data.This is not meant to be a d isparaging comment on pre-vious efforts in l inguist ics,  for, after  all, the cont in-gency that has opened our eyes to these shortcomings  didnot exist unti l  a few years ago.
Tradi t ional  linguists,.and espec ia l ly  grammarians,  could carry on their  bus inessquite happi ly  on the more or less expl ic i t  assumpt ion  thatlanguage - l ike so many things in the sti l l  w ide-spreadP latonic  view of the world - could be separated into twolevels:  the ideal, uncontaminated one of pure structure* The research reported in this paper was sponsored by theU.5.A i r  Force Off ice of Sc ient i f ic  Research (OAR), Inform-at ion 5ciences U i rectorate  (Srant AFOSR 1319-67) and act-ive ly  supported by the Univers i ty  of Georgia,  Athens,U5A.- 2 -o r  form that was inherent ly  general isable,  and the s l ight-ly messy, unsystemic,  and therefore far less interest ingone of ind iv idua l  content.
This d ichotomy was possib le andworkab le  as long as the use of language was restr icted toorgan isms who, by the time they embarked on l inguist ic  act-iv i t ies,  had necessar i ly  absorbed a vast body of exper ien-t ial  and conceptuaI  knowledge,  on which, more or less con-sc ious ly ,  they could draw whenevez the formulat ion or com-prehens ion  of a l inguist ic  express ion required somethingbeyond the rules of the ideal  grammar.With the advent of computers  the s i tuat ion was ~edical -ly changed.
Suddenly  l inguists  could and would find them-se lves  committed,  for one reason or another, to transmittheir  know-how to a potent ia l  language user who did notpossess  any a pr ior i  exper ient ia l  or conceptual  knowledgewhatsoever .
Thus there arose innumerable  quest ions which,h i therto,  no one had ever been compel led to answer, and itbecame painfu l ly  obvious that the appl icat ion of much ofthe l inguists '  cher ished theoret ica l  knowledge to actuallanguage mater ia l  presupposed a cons iderab le  amount of asyet unexplored preprocess ing of that very material .I shal l  not try to cata logue the types of quest ion andthe kinds of problem which have been thrust upon the l in-guist  by the appearance of computers  - every one of youis fami l iar  with some if not all of them; instead I shouldl ike to present  a few examples and show the d i rect ion inwhich, we bel ieve,  some solut ions can be found.By ' l inguist ic  act iv i t ies '  or 'handling language data'we mean, for instance,  formulat ing a given message in espec i f ic  natura l  language; or recognis ing,  in a givenpiece of language,  the message intent iona l ly  formulated- 3 -in that way by an author; or t ranslat ing a formulat ion giv-en in one natural  language into a 'corresponding '(*) form-ulat ion in another  natural  language, etc.
Since the 'pre-processing'  in all  these cases involves what, summari ly,is cal led semantics,  it is necessery to stress that in ourview of language there is no unbr idgeable abyss or opposi -tion between semantics and syntax.
In fact, we speak o f'relational'  semantics (a term already used by Ul lmann (I))when we try to define that part of an expraseion's  meaningthat is determined by specif ic  syntact ic  funct ions (or Co.~r-relators);  and we call ' lexical' semant ics the attempt -for instance the lex icographer 's  - to define the meaningof words as separate indiv idual  items.In tradit ional  grammars the lexical items of a naturallanguage are c lass i f ied as 'parts of speech' accord ing totheir generic syntact ic funct ions and/or their morpholog ic -al character ist ics ;  in corre lat ional  grammar (**) they arec lass i f ied exc lus ive ly  according to the actual  roles theycan play in corre lat ional  structures; moreover, whi le tra-d i t ional  grammars operate with about a dozen di f ferent  ge-* Note that since we are interested, not in developing a ri-gid logical ly  formal ised theory of grammar, but in develop-ing a f lexible operat ional  system fwr the automatic inter-pretat ion and handl ing of natura l - language sentences andtext, we do not require formal instruments for the determ-inat ion of 'meaning', ' inter l inguist ic  correspondence' ,'synonymy', etc.
; for our empir ical  purposes the consensusof prof ic ient language speakers is the relevant and suf-f ic ient cr iter ion.
** Although both theory and pract ice of Corre lat ional  Gram-mar have been drast ica l ly  modif ied in our empir ica l  appl i -cat ions, much of the terminology and the basic concep~derive from the pioneer ing work of Si lvio Ceccato , whom Iwas fortunate enough to have as fr iend and teache~.- 4 -ner ic  syntact ic  funct ions,  our corre lat iona l  Engl ish gram-mar d is t ingu ishes  several  hundred corre lators  (in the pre-sent vers ion of our automat ic  parser  (3) there are 350).The l ist of these corre lators  is the result of intuit -ive analys is  of Engl ish tex~s, cont inual  ref inement bymeans of ins ights gained in the t rans lat ion of Engl ish sen-tence structures into other languages (*), and by experi -ments  with an automat ic  pars ing procedure whose output,  orlack of output,  inev i tab ly  demonstrates  the shortcomingsor, as we p~efer  to put it, the degree o~ completenessreached by the system's grammar.
In our terminology a 'cot-relator '  is a connect ive funct ion which l inks two pieces -e i ther  words or word combinat ions  - and thus forms a unitwe cal l  'correlat ion' .
Corre lators  are div ided into sever-al types, the main d is t inct ion being made between impl ic i tcor re lators ,  which are ind icated in the sentence merely bythe juxtapos i t ion  of the items they link, and expl ic i t  cot-re lators ,  which are ind icated by speci f ic  words (mostlyprepos i t ions  and conjunct ions) .To serve as a val id tool in the parsing or interpreta-t ion of sentences,  a corre lator  must not only have an in-d iv idua l  code number ('Ic' or corre lat ion index) but thepar t i cu la r  re lat ion it establ ishes,  between the two i temsit corre lates,  must be character ised or expl icated.
Thisexp l i ca t ion  may be an ad hoc descr ipt ion,  an i l lust rat iveparaphrase,  a sui table t ransform ~ l a Chomsky (4) or Fi l l -more (5), or a symbol ic  express ion devised along the l ines(6) of funct ion symbols in log ica l  ca lcu lus  .
* Trans la t ion  f requent ly  helps to p inpoint  re lat ional  ambi-gu i t ies  which, a l though re levant  in the d isambiguat ion  ofother  structures,  are not immediate ly  perceived by themono l ingua l  speaker  or reader.- 5 -As ~mples  o f  cor re la tor  exp l i ca t ion ,  here  are  two (oneconcerning an implicit correlator, the other an explicitone) taken from the correlator list which has been imple-mented in our operational system:Corr.

Description3670 N generic type: verb phrase complemented by in-finitive;Explication: the gram.
subject is the actor of theinfinitive activity; the infinitive specifiesthe purpose of the subject's primary activity.e.g.
"He works to live","I braked to avoid the child";but not: "He began to live" (3430 N),"I had to avoid the child" (3410 N);no__~r: "He was eager to live" (3350 N),"I was clever to avoid the child" (7012 N).0243 E generic type: ~Y, temporal limitation;Explication: the item on the right of  "by" speci-fies the point in time after which what is as-serted by the item on the left of "by" is to beconsidered an accomplished fact.e.g.
"You will be paid by Christmas","He had left by 1865";but no__~t: "You will be paid by cheque" (~257 E),"He had left by the back door" (0251 ?
);no._~r: "You will be paid by the treasurer"  (0247 E),"He had left by sheer determination" (0255 E).It should be clear that the 'Explication' is intendedto describe as univocally as possible the relation Qua re-(*)lation witDout regard for the particular items that are" In practice it is, of course, not alweye easy to formu-late the explication without reference to particular items;but as long as the analyst remains scrupu lous ly  aware ofthe intention, this is not a serious impediment and, inour experience, a sufficiently general formulation can al-ways be found sooner or later.- 6 -e l ig ib le  to be l inked by that relat ion.

the ternary unit cons is t ing  ofone spec i f ic  cor re la tor  and the two items (words or them-se lves  word -combinat ions )  that are l inked by it; and we re-p resent  cor re la t ions  - for instance the ones operat ive  inthe f i rst  phrase sample) in this manner:works to l ive2230 N - j  1- -2310 N ~I 367L N - - Jwhich cor responds  to a convent iona l  t ree-s t ructure  withlabe l led  nodes:~I .

(3670N)~(2230N) (2310N)/ \He works  to l iveIn order  to "recognise this structure in the l inear in-put str ing of the sentence,  f irst each of the four wordi tems must be character i sed  as a poss ib le  candidate forl inkage by cor re la tors  2230 N and 2310 N respect ive ly  (*)-,and both these corze la t ions  have then to be character i sedas poss ib le  cand idates  for l inkage by corre lator  3670 N.This  character i sa t ion  is ach ieved by cor re la t ion  indices(or Ic's) ass igned to the ind iv idua l  i tems and spec i fy ing(a) the code numbers  of the cor re la turs  by means of which?
The cor re la tor  numbers  we use were o~ig ina i \ ]y  s ign i f i cantas to the kinds of re lat ion;  cont inua l  correct iLns  and ad-d i t ions,  however,  have thoroughly  ob l i terated thJ~ signi-f i cance and the numbers are now nei ther  consecut ive  norcharacter i s t i c .- 7 -the  i tem can be l inked to other items; and (b) whether  thei tem can occupy the r ight -hand (RH) or the lef t -hand (LH)place in the speci f ied corre lat ion.
(The process of ass igning Ic's, obviously,  is of onetype when the item to which the Ic's are to be ass igned isa pre -estab l i shed vocabulary  word, and of quite anotherwhen the item is a cor re la t ion  formed in the course of theanalys is  procedure; in the f irst case the word's  str ing ofIc's is the result  of ~ pr ior i  ass ignat ion;  in the secondcase it is the result  of a dynamic process cal led 'reclas-s i f icat ion' ,  implemented by means of an intr icate system ofrules which take into account  the cor re lator  respons ib lefor the made corre lat ion  as wel l  as the indiv idual  charac-ter of the pieces corre lated in the par t icu lar  instance;for a full d iscuss ion of the operat iona l  rec lass i f i ca t ionprocedure see ref.
No.7).From the sample phrases given under cor re la tor  3670 Nit is evident that the two part ia l  phrases const i tut ing  ther ight-hand piece of the l isted corre lat ions,  i.e.
"to l ive"and "to avoid the child", must bear RH-Icts not only ofcorre lator  3670 N out also of curre lators  3430 N, 3410 N,3350 N, and 7012 N, whi le the part ial  phrases const i tut ingthe lef t -hand piece of the two cor re la t ions  3670 N wil lbear only the LH-Ic of cor re lator  3670 N and not those re-ferr ing to the corre lators  operat ive in the remaining foursamples.
(In the sample phrases given under cor re lator0243 E, the s i tuat ion is symmetr ica l ly  inverted,  i.e.
thetwo part ial  phrases on the left wi l l  bear only the LH- Ic  ofcor re lator  0243 E, whi le the part ia l  phrases on the r ightmust bear RH- Ic 's  of ~ the other four l isted corre latorsas well .
)This ass ignat ion of Ic's automat ica l ly  prec ludes the- 8 -fo rmat ion  of unacceptab le  phrase in terpretat ions ,  such as :He began to  l iveL2230 N ~ L2310 N - - - Jt *3670 N - jor I was c lever  to avoid the chi ldi L42~0 N~ L2310 N ~ LSOiO N~L 2oso N-J L - -4o lo  N~I -367o N Iwhich would  be roughly  equ iva lent  to "de began in orderto l ive" or, respect ive ly ,  "I was c lever  in order  to avoidthe ch i ld"  (Note that if we change the form of the LH-phrasein the second example and say "I was be inq c lever  to avoidthe chi ld" ,  the 3670 N in terpretat ion  becomes acceptab lewhi le  the 7012 N in terpretat ion  - equ iva lent  to "to avoidthe ch i ld  was c lever  of me" - is no longer  poss ib le!)
.T rad i t iona l  grammars  tend to cons ider  such in terpreta -t iona l  d i s t inc t ions  (if, indeed, they make them) as 'se-mant ic ' ;  for cor re la t iona l  grammar they are c lear ly  rela-t ional ,  beca~:se they are handled exc l~s ive ly  by the mechan-ism of Ic-~,~tching - and thi~; mechan ism is the operat iona l -ly imp lemented  syntax of the system.
And there is anotherc r i te r ion  as well.
In dll the ~bove cases, the ass ignat ionof Ic 's to vocabu lary  w~rds or cor re la t iona l  products  emerg-in 9 in the course  of the pars ing  procedure can be determin-ed by an examinat ion  of the indiv iOual  item with regard tothe exp l i ca t ion  of the cor re la tor  whose Ic is being con-s idered  (i.e.
w i thout  cons ider in  9 comple~nentary items);this examinat ion ,  in pr inc ip le ,  is s imi lar  to the examina-t ion - in t rad i t iona l  grammar - of a morpho log ica l ly  de-f i c ient  or indef in i te  word with regard to the poss ib i l i tyof its being for ins tance a vet0 or a noun; or, to put itin another  way, this examinat ion  is essent ia l ly  d i f fe rent- 9 -f rom the one required to decide whether  two given i tems arecompat ib le  as RH and LH pieces in one par t icu lar  syntact icstructure(8!The quest ion of pred icab i l i ty  - espec ia l ly  if e laboratedin the way suggested in an essay by f red -  5ommers 19;-" " is acase in point.
Whether  phrases such as:"blue grass" or "cer ise ideas","the ind igest ion of angels"  or "the wings of the morn-ing",are acceptable,  acceptable  only metaphor ica l ly ,  or not ac-ceptable  at all, is apparent ly  not a re lat iona l  quest ion;the re lat ion - a kind of 'appurtenance'  - does not seem tochange, nor could we say that any of the four phrases isunacceptab le  because one of its i tems is such that it cannever be related in that way; since we have no object ionwhen the same relat ion is asserted in "cer ise paper" o c"clear ideas", we can only conc ludethat  there are certa initems to which certa in propert ies  or th ingscannot  be saidto apperta in and that, therefore,  it is a quest ion of le__~x-i ca l  semantics.If the semant ic  analyses in i t iated by Ceccato in the(-)195O's were pusneo further, it seems l ikely that a re-lat ion such as 'appurtenance' could be demonstrated to in-corporate (i.e.
t~J have confused) a number of spec i f iab lesubrelat ions~ and, once we had iso lated these subrelat ions,much if not al l  of what we now, for the lack of demonstrab-le d ist inct ions,  have to call  ' lexical ambiguity '  couldperhaps be resolved re lat iuna l ly  in a sat i s factory  way.

IO).- i0  -Thus  it may indeed be so, that our need to resort to astatic, non-re lat ional  semantic c lass i f icat ion of items,in order to interpret  phrases and sentences, is only themeasure  of our ignorance concerning the basic characterand composi t ion of relations; and that, eventual ly,  it wil lbecome possible to der ive a comprehensive and foolproofgeneral  semantics from the invest igat ion of relat ional  con-d i t ions as they mani fest  themselves in our actual use oflanguage.Let me try to make these conjectures a l i tt le less ob-scure.

(Note: the paraphrase given for type Ais impossible here; and if an ambiguous adjectiveoccurs in G, the construction determines its mean-ing; e.g.

'aspect',  'assessment' ,  'at t i tude' ,etc .
,are st i l l  rather vague).
~hen we come to a sentence- in ter -pret ive  procedure,  however,  such a l ist ing of re lat ionalposs ib i l i t i es  does not get us anywhere,  unless we are ableto prov ide each type with some cr i ter ion by means of whichwe can recognise  it in the input text.In an at tempt to d iscover  some such cr i ter ion,  we as-- 13  -sembled  a corpus of about i00 re lat ive ly  frequent ad ject -(11)ives from a recent compendium of ?ngl ish word f requencyand examined their ind iv idual  poss ib i l i t ies  to funct ion asacceptab le  const i tuents  in the ten types of const ruct ion(for a complete report  on our f indings, see ref.
No.12).The results of this invest igat ion  were compi led in the formof a matrix, showing for each adject ive the types of con-struct ion in which it can occur.5ummaris ing some of the observat ions  that could be maderegarding that matrix, we can say:a) the ad ject ives  that fit const ruct ion  type D (viz.
ce_._~r-talon, expected, known, ~ ,  said, sure, unknow__~n, un l i ke -Iv) do not occur in any of the other construct ions.b) the adject ives that fit const ruct ion  type H (viz.
co___nn-ten.~t, qlad, happy, ~ ,  sa_~d, sat is f ied,  sorry) do not oc-cur in any of the other const ruct ions  - with the except ionof sad, which can occur also in type J.c) the ad ject ives  that fit const ruct ion  type B (viz.

~ood I ='pleasing',  ~ = 'benefic ial ' ,  qood 3 = 'moral' - there lat ional  l ist ing of the indiv idual  meanings  is not an im-mediate  help in the d isambiguat ion  of a given string.
Never-theiess, it is a step forward from the pos i t ion where everyadject ive nan to be cons idered a potent ia l  candidate for all- 14  -ten  const ruct ions .

What we are.
in fact,~y ing  to show, is that the analys is  of the re lat ions foundto obta in  between the i tems of phrases or sentences leads,f i rst,  to an extens iona l ,  and eventual ly ,  to an intens ion-al semant ic  c lass i f i ca t ion  of the lex ica l  i tems const i tut -ing these phrases or sentences.This par t i cu la r  sector  of ad ject ive  cunstrL~ction is, ofIcourse,  not the only area of Engl ish grammar which makes itseem p laus ib le  that semant ic  c lass i f i ca t ions  of lexemes c~nbe der ived  from empi r ica l  grouping accord ing to their  rela-- 15  -t i ona l  behaviour.
The range of re lat ions expressed in Eng-l ish by prepos i t ions  is extremely fert i le  in this regard,but since it is also extremely wide, we have not yet broughtour survey of it to a def in i t ive conclusion.
Part ia l  re-sults (13) however,  indicate that, here too, re lat iona l  semant ics  success fu l ly  absorbs a great deal of what, hitherto,was considered lexical  or unsystemic.A comprehens ive  study of the verb-object  re lat ions (asti l l  poor ly  def ined area in our operat iona l  system) pro-mises to yield the perhaps most convinc ing conf i rmat ion  ofour thesis.Even a very suPerf ic i~l  examinat ion of a t rans i t ive verband the grammat ica l  objects  that occur  with it, shows thatthe way in which the two are related may vary widely.
If,for instance, we take the verb "to pay", we find that=l) in "He paid the dr iver" the subject gives up some-thing of economic value (e.g.
a sum of money); andthe object  speci f ies the receiver;2) in "He paid his bi l l"  the subject gives up somethingof econ.

value; the ob ject  spec i f ies  the amount.Leaving aside the rarer and the more metaphor ica l  usesof the verb (such as= to pay attent ion,  homage, a visit ,etc . )
we can now take a corpus of  nouns, t ry  each one o fthem as object of "to pay", and determine which of thethree descr ibed re lat ions it fits.
This Wil l  extens iona l lydef ine three noun c lasses (not necessar i ly  mutua l ly  exclus-ive, because some of our nouns may fit into more than oneof the relat ions) for which we can then tentat ive ly  formu-late intens ive semantic def in i t ions=- 16  -l ' )  i tems that can act as receiver  of i tems having aneconomic  value; e.g.

;2') i tems imply ing a def in i te  econ.

;3') i tems ind icat ing  a speci f ic  econ.
value; e.g.
anynumeral  fo l lowed by an ind icat ion of currency,and pronomina l  express ions  such as "a lot n, " l i t t le","much", etc.The verb " topay"  is also doubly transi t ive,  i.e.
it canbe const ruc ted  with a dat ive an._.~d an accusat ive object  inone phrase,  e.g.
:4) "He paid the butcher  ten dol lars"  (in which "thebutcher"  is the receiver) .If we now test our corpus of nouns in this const :uct ion,we find, f irst,  that only  the items l isted in group I' canbe used as dat ive object  and that they cannot be used asaccusat ive  object;  second, that if i tems of group 2' or 3'are used as d i rect  object ,  the dat ive object  always playsthe part of ' receiver' ;  third~ we find that we have to con-s ide~ su~e new i tems (occurr ing only in con junct ion  with adet ive object)  which are not members of the three i istedc lasses  and which, moreover ,  change the role o ~ the dat iveobject,  as for instance in:5) "He paid his dr iver  a hol iday" (where "his dr iver"is the benef ic ia ry  of the sub ject 's  act).We thus get a fourth group of possib le objects;  theirin tens iona l  def in i t ion  iS..less obvious,  but we can tenta-t ive ly  put down:5') i tems intended for personal  ' " ; consumpt ion e.g.drin____~k, a term at col leqe,  a mea_______~/, a trip round theworld,  a vacat ion,  etc.- 17  -One point that is of special interest  in these sti l l  verycrude and incomplete results of re lat ional  analys is  and se-mantic c lass i f icat ion,  is the fact that, a l though the clas-ses of 'receiver' and 'beneficiary'  are co-extens ive in thecorpus, they do not seem to create ambiguit ies,  since thepart icu lar  role of an item that is ambivalent  in this re-spect, is, in any given example, determined by the c lass i -f icat ion of the direct object; in other words, if the di-rect object belongs to either group 2' or 3', the dat ive ob-ject plays the part of 'receiver'; if the direct object  be-longs to group 5', the dative object plays the part of 'be-nef ic iary' .This rule, incidentaI ly ,  seems rigid enough to deal withat least some phrases which, on a purely exper ient ia l  basis(i.e.
'knowledge of the world'),  would have to be rated ra-ther odd or unlikely.
If, for instance, we came across thesentence "5he paid he~ lover a week of clams", we might beuncertain how to interpret  precisely "a week of clams",but we would have no doubt that it had to be something herlover could personal Iy  consume.
- And there is consider-able reassurance to be got from the impl icat ion thot (atleast in some cases) the logic of relat ional  semantics ismore powerful  than the stat ist ics  of factual experience.~e could adduce many more examples of transit ive verbsand relevant object c lass i f icat ion,  but at the present stageof the analysis this wouid add little: the results are in-var iably suggest ive,  even indicat ive,  but they cannot beconsidered conclusive.
Therefore, I shall merely summarisewhat we expect from tnese invest igat ions.On the basis of work accompl ished during the last 18months, it appears that the semantic c lasses der ived fromrelat ional  analys is  are recurs ive and that their  num-- IB  -bet wi l l  remain usefu l ly  smal ler  than the number of c lass i -f ied items.
There wil l ,  of course, be many more semant icc lasses  than grammars  have h i therto contemplated  - but giv-en the versat i l i ty  of natura l  language,  this should notrea l ly  surpr ise  us; nor is there any need to be par t icu lar -ly pess imis t i c  about the poss ib i l i ty  of imp lement ing  sucha vo luminous  and in t r i cate  data base in a computer  system.We all have seen how the ear ly  computat iona l  l inguists 'wor r ies  concern ing  storage capac i ty  and process ing speedshave ~ been made to appear  anachron is t i c  by techno log ic -al progress ,  and this progress  does not yet seem to be any-where  near its cei l ing.As to the theoret i ca l  imp l i ca t ions  of our kind of lan-guage analys is ,  I should l ike to put forward one suggest -ion.
Assuming  that we can der ive (and the mater ia l  present -ed here does imply prec ise ly  this) a sa t i s fac tory  semant icc lass i f i ca t ion  of lexical  i tems from their  re lat iona l  pro-per t ies  def ined in terms of an adequate ly  d i f fe rent ia tedsyntax,  it may be more pro f i tab le  (and, perhaps, also morecorrect )  to v iew syntax and semantics,  not as a pair  ofmutua l ly  exc lus ive  opposi tes ,  but rather as the axes of acont inuum of meaning;  every semant ic  e lement,  part ic le,feature  (or howevec  we want to cal l  itl would, in such af rame of reference,  have both a re lat iona l  and a lexicalcoord inate  - which would not only make it poss ib le  for usto d iscuss  one and the same item from two points of vieww i thout  cont rad ic t ion ,  but, I bel ieve,  it would also be ause fu l  advance towards an economica l  representat ion  of l in-gu is t i c  data in computat iona l  procedures.J- 19  -R ?

The advent of computers  has changed thes i tuat ion.
Since machines  are devoid of exper ient ia l  know-ledge, they need a more expl ic i t  grammar to handle naturallanguage.
Cor re la t iona l  5rammar is an at tempt ?n that di-rect ion.
