jpABSTRACTq'his paper provides an account of the role that theinteraction between ominal and temporal referenceplays in resolving temporal reference.
Exploiting thisinteraction in resolving temporal reference clarifieshow the process of resolving nominal reference in-teracts with the process of resolving temporal refer-ence, and how a restricted set of worht knowledge con-tributes to resolving temporal reference.1 INTRODUCTIONB.esolving reference or anaphora is of great interestin computational linguistics and formM semantics.Research on reference began with the developmentof models to account for nominal reference bronghtabout by the usage of nominal expressions uch asdefinite noun phrases and pronominals (Grosz, Joshiand Weinstein 1983; Kameyama 1986).
Recently anumber of researchers have indicated that temporalexpressions such as tense morphemes and temporaladverbials can be regarded as referring expressionsand have proposed models for temporal reference res-olution (Hinrichs 1986; Hwang and Schubert 1992;Kameyama, Passonnean and Poesio 1993; Lascarides1.992; Partee 1984; Song and Cohen 1991; Webber1988).Sentences ina dialogue describe ventualities 1 andintroduce them into the context.
The time of an even-tuality described by a sentence is interpreted as tem-porally related to the times of other eventualities thatwere introduced into the context earlier in the dia-logue.
Temporal expressions are regarded as referringexpressions ince they convey information about thetime of an eventuality, which is interpreted relative tothe times of other eventualities in the context.
Re-solving temporal reference means determining whattemporal relationships exist between an eventualitydescribed by a sentence of a dialogue and eventuali-ties that have been introduced into the context ear-lier in the dialogue.
2 Resolving temporal referenceis requisite to many tasks, such as designing a natu-ral language interface to a planning system in whichtemporal information is crucial (Crouch and Pullmantan  event.uality is the general term for an event, process orstate, due to Bach (1986).~The chief concern here is temporal reference to intersen-tential context.
Thus this paper does not address the probiemof determining what temporal relationships an eventuality de-scribed by a clause of a sent, ence has with eventualities describedby other clauses of the same sentence.
This problem is coveredby Brent (1990), Itwang et al (1992), and Reichenbaeh (1947).1993).To understand the notion of temporal reference,consider the following dialogue, (dl).
a Assume tha~dialogue participants, Bill and John, mutually knowthat John received an e-mail message from Mary.Dialogue (dl)(sl) Bill: Mary karano mail wa mot-teirn-yone?from mail ToP have~PRESENTYou have the mail from Mary, don't your(s2) John: Keshi-ta-kedo.delete-PASTI deleted it.
(s3) Bilh Hontoni!reallyReally\](s4) John: Sochira niwa tensoushi-ta-hazuda-yo.you DAT forward~PhsT-sure.I 'm sure that l forwarded it to you.
(s5) John: Sochira no mail box ni at-ta-desho?you GFN mail boz" in be-PAST.II was in your mail bo~', wasn't it?.Sentence (s2) describes an eventnality of deleting,Ed, and sentence (s4) describes an eventuality of for-warding, F/.
Both eventualities are past ones, sincethe matrix verbs, "tensousnru (forward)" and "kesu(delete)", 4 describe momentary acts and are accom-panied with the past-tense morpheme "ta".
Althoughthe tense morphemes ofsentences convey informationabout the times of eventualities described by the sen-tences, the context also imposes restrictions on thetimes of the eventualities.
In dialogue (dl), the timeof tQ described by (s4) is interpreted as relative tothe time of \]'d~ in the context: i.e.
the time of E/ isbefore the time of 1,2d.
in this sense, the time of 1~ isreferred to in uttering sentence (s4).Existing models of temporal reference account forthe parMlel between temporal and nominal reference.Itowever, as I will state in see.
2, existing modelsfail to explain the interaction between temporal ref-erence and nominal reference (reference interactionfor short), i{eference interaction is a phenomenon iwhich tile process of resolving nominal reference in-ahl extfibiting a .Japanese dialogue, English words such as"Mary" mtd "mail" are used only for easy comprehensibility, hiaddlt, ion, sentence-final forms such as "yone", "kedo", "yo", and"desho" indicate mental states of file speaker that are/mrelatedto the subject of this paper.4 "tensoushi-" and "keshi-" in file dialogue are inflections ofthe verbs "tensousm'u" and "kesu" respectively.1138teracts with the process of resolving temporal refer-ence, when an utterance involves temporal and nomi-nal reference at the same time.
l)ue to as1 insutticientaccount of the reference interaction, existing modelscannot show how the process of resolving nominal ref-erence Mfects the process of resolving temporal refer-ence.The chief concern of this paper is to describe therole that the reference interaction plays in resolvingtelnporal reference and demonstrate hat the referenceinteraction serves to clarity how a restricted set ofworld knowledge contributes to the resolution process.I focus on sentences with past-tense morphemes inJapanese dialogues.
Previous work also used past-tense sentences as a touchstone to show the validityof a model (IIinrichs 1986; Kameyama ct al.
1993;Lascarides 1992; Partee 1984; Webber 1988).
As Iwill state in sec.
2.2, the retk'xence interaction is not adomestic plleuolnenon in Japanese dialogues.In sec.
2, I argue that existing models do not de-.count for the reference interaction, that the referenceinteraction plays an important role in an account ofhow temporal reference is resolved, and that exploit-ing the reference interaction clarifies how a rest, riotedset of world knowledge serves to resolve tempered ref-erence.
In sec.

','he notion was introduced by Webl,er (~988),Dialogue participants pay attention to the time of aneventuality that is in the temporal focus.
'\['he time, 51',of an eventuality described by the cnrrent sentence isinterpreted according to the time, Ttf, in the temporalfocus.
Existing models that apply to intersententialcontext use the notion of temporal focus (llwang el el,1992; Song ct el.
19911.
Kameyama et el.
(1993) re-fined the.
notion of temporal focus and proposed thenotion of temporal centering.
In formal semantics,models of temporal anaphora based on discourse rep-resentation theory have been proposed (ltinrichs 7198{3;Partee 1984).
'Fhese models concentrate on the tenseinterpretation of adjacent sentences its a narrative dis-course.
Thus, the time of ;m ew;ntuality described l)5'a sentence immediately preceding tile current sentencecan be regarded as being in the temporal {hens.There ~r0.
two ~tpproaches to prol)lcm (ii): (ii-a)av approach based on linguistic cuen such as tensemorphelnes, the aspectual class of verbs, and the de-scriptive order of eventualities in a dialogne; (ii-b) anapproach based oil worht knowledge of the causal re-lationships between eveutnalities.With regard Co approach (ii-a), the following de-fault interpretation rules (ilinrichs 1986; Kameyamaet el.
1993; bascarides 1992; Partce 1984; Webb0r19881 have been used.
'~'De.fault into.rpretat ion rules)Provided that an eventuality, t?, is described by thecurrent sentence, the time of an eventuality, let\], isin the temporal focus, and both/',' and \[?t/ are past.eventualities, then(R1) The time of E is after the time of/?tf if bothI?
and l';tf are non-st, drive,(1{2) The time of/?
contains the time of ICe\] if \]?
isstative and l','tf is non-stative.These rules are t;ermed efault interpretation rulessince they are utilized when world knowledge ofcausality is not available.\[n approach (ii-b), the temporal relationship be-tween l,\] and .l?tf is determined according to worldknowledge of the causal relationships between eventu-alities.
Lascarides (1.9!t2) presented a model based ona theory of defeasihle inference for integrating worldknowledge of causality with the process of determiningthe temporal and causal relationships between eventualities mentioned in a discourse.
This approach wasalso adopted in a model proposed by Kameyama ct el.(1993).
In these models, approaches (ii-~) and (ii-b)are unified within a single framework.
Let me callthe interpretation based on approach (ii-a) the (le-fanlt interpretation, and the interpretation based onapproach (ii-b) the knowledge-based interpretation.The knowledge~based interpretation is preferred overthe default interpretation when they disagree.l,et me explain how existing models work by using(tialogue (dl) ~ as, example.
1 focus on how (s4) i,,interpreted, assuming that the time of /~'a is in the.temporal focus, l)eNnlt interpretation rule (hi.l) saysthat the Lime of \]Q must be after the time of lea sittceboth eventualities are not>stative, past eventualities.Ilowevcr, the relevant interpretation is that F,/ tem-porally precedes l','a.
Thus, the default interpretationdoes not coincide with the relevant interpretation.
Inthis case, existing models resort to world knowledgeof the ransal relationships between ?
'a and Ej .
ltow.cw'.r, existing models do not clarify what kind of worldknowledge is use.d (Kameyama et el.
1993; I,ascarides1992).
In this sense, the world knowledge used in ex-isting models is unrestricted.
1 agree with such anapproach its that various causal relationships are in--volved ill the process of resolving reference.
IIoweveLit is desirable to find a restricted set of world knowl-edge and avoid resorting directly to the entire set of~Note that the time of a stative ven~uallty is usually nc)tregarded as being in the t.emporal focus.1139world knowledge of causality since such knowledge isenormous.Consequently, existing models exploit the notionof temporal focus or temporal center, which servesonly to show that temporal reference is accounted forin the same way as nominal reference.
However, exist-ing models do not explain how the process of resolv-ing nominal reference affects the process of resolvingtemporal reference and assume that the entire set ofknowledge of causality can be used.2.2 Reference interactionIn this section, I argue that the notion of referenceinteraction provides an account of the temporal refer-ence in (s4), which existing approaches ignore.
More-over, a restricted set of world knowledge can be usedto explain the reference interaction.Sentence (sl) introduces an individual 6, M, whichis an e-mail message.
Sentence (s4) involves nominalreference to M: tile object of "tensousnrn (forward)"is zero-pronominalized and refers to M. Moreover,sentence (s4) involves the interaction between nomi-nal and temporal reference.
That is to say, what theobject being forwarded is affects what the time of for-warding is.
I will explain this below.When someone forwards something to someoneelse, the time of forwarding must be during the timewhen the object being forwarded exists.
In otherwords, the time of forwarding depends on what theobject being forwarded is.
Moreover, when some-one deletes omething, the time when the object be-ing deleted exists must be before the time of delet-ing.
This kind of world knowledge can be regarded asknowledge of temporal relationships between eventu-alities and the existential status of individuals.
Judg-ing fi:om such knowledge, the eventuality of forward-ing, EI,  cannot temporally follows the eventualityof deleting, Ea.
This is because both the object of"kesu (delete)" and the object of "tensousuru (for-ward)"refer to M, so the time of t~'f must be duringthe time when M exists and the time when M existsrnust be before the time of Ed, The interpretationconsistent with such knowledge is that /~Sf temporallyprecedes Ea.
Consequently, identifying the referent ofthe zero-pronominalized object o f /Q  serves to resolvetemporal reference, and the knowledge of temporal re-lationships between eventualities and the existentialstatus of individuals can be used to explain the refer-ence interaction.
7Moreover, knowledge of the temporal relationshipsbetween eventualities and the existential status of in-dividnals can be regarded as a restricted set of worldknowledge of causality.
It is restricted because givenan eventuality, E, we have only to allow for the in-dividuals that constitute E and do not have to allow?f lere, " individual" is used as  a term for a single person orthing.7In this paper,  only nomina l  reference to individuals is al-lowed for.for all eventualities that can be causally related toE.
Exploiting the reference interaction clarifies howsuch a restricted set of world knowledge contributesto resolving temporal reference.
When such restrictedworld knowledge is sufficient o resolve temporal ref-erence, immediate recourse to the entire set of worldknowledge of causality call be avoided.
Note that suchknowledge is not selected arbitrarily.
It is the knowl-edge that is necessary for explaining the reference in-teraction.Next I review two existing proposals that are re-lated to the argument above.
First, Hwang el al.
(1992) argued that resolving temporal reference re-quires plausible inference that can interact with var-ious processes uch as resolution of anaphora, intro-duction of new individuals and identification of spa-tial and temporal frames.
They also argue that theplausible inference has to rely on world knowledgesuch as that one normally would not buy brokenthings (IIwang e?
al.
1992: p.239).
Their argumentagrees with the approach presented here.
They didnot, however, present a concrete model to support theargument.Second, Webber and Baldwin (1992) discussedthe integration of two independent mechanisms forcontext-change by entity introduction and by eventsimulation.
The idea of integrating these context-change mechanisms and that of exploiting the refer-ence interaction in resolving reference share the viewthat the relationships between eventualities and theexistential status of entities or individuals erve in in-terpreting referring expressions.
They, however, fo-cused on interpreting nominal reference made by theuse of definite nouns, rather than on the problem of re-solving temporal reference by exploiting the referenceinteraction, which is the chief concern of this paper.Finally, it is easy to see that the reference interac-tion also occurs in an English dialogue.
In an Englishcounterpart of (dl), the pronoun "it" is used the sameway as a Japanese zero pronoun is used.
l,ikewise,the restricted knowledge stated above is common toJapanese and English.3 A FRAMEWORKA framework is presented, within which the referenceinteraction is exploited in resolving temporal refer-ence.
First, in sec.
3.1, the descriptive device is shown.Next, in sec.
3.2, the process of resolving temporal ref-erence is described.3.1 A descriptive deviceIn a diMogue, sentences convey information about timspeakers' mental attitudes toward eventualities.
Thisframework does not concern the mental attitudes, butfocuses on the eventualities described in the sentences.An eventuality is written as a variant of the Davidso-nian representation (l)avidson 1980; Vlach 1993).
Forexample, the informational content of the eventualityof forwarding described by (s4) is written as follows.1140(rl) 7'ypc( .c \] l , .t,'orward)&Agcnt( *e \]l, *agcnt~ )&leccp( *e \] 1, *rccpl )&Objert(*c\]l, *objl)&'l'imc(*c\] 1,,t\] z)&NonStativc( *c \]l )& ll carer( *rccpl )&Tl?.el( Bc f orc, *Q, , *t,v l )&T t?.el( *rcl z , *t : , ,  *t \] .

1 )&SpecchT'irne( .t,v~ )&:/'cmpFocus(*t\] ..... 1).Symbols starting with a cN)ital letter representconstants and symbols starting witl, the ctmracter '*'represent varlahles.
Symbol '~;' is an of)erator \[or con-junetkm.Type(L',T) means that eventuality l,; is classifiedas a type T. t{.epresentation (rl) specifies the.
even-tuality, *e/l ,  that *agcntl tbrwards *objt to *rceplat time *t\],.
The agem, and tire object of forward-ing are represented as variables, since they are zero-pronominalized.
Llcarcr(l') means that P is thehearer.
In the above, the recipient of forwarding isidentified with the hearer since it is specified by tirepronoun "sochira", designating the hearer.
In addi-tion, ewmtuality *c:1 is non-st~d.ive.SpecchTimc(T) means that time 7' is the speechtime, Tcmp\]Coeus(7 ') means that time T is in thetemporal focus, and 7'Rel(l{, 7't,7:e) means that tem-poral relationship lg holds between time ~I'\] and 7).In this framework, temporal relationships are repre-sented based on temporal logic proposed by Allen(1983) and times are treated as temporal intervals.
Inthe above, time *tSl is before sl)eech time *GpJ since*Ill is specified by the past-tense morpheme "ta".Time *tlo~.,t,t is in the temporal focus.
Temporal re-lationship betweeen *Ill attd *l\]o~u,l is representedas a w~riable, *roll.
Resolving temporal rel)rencemeans determining a relevant tentporal relationshipbetweeen *tit and *t\]ocu.,1.Knowledge of the temporal relationship betweenan ewmtuality and the existential status of individu-als is represented as a triplet < \]~;R, {i\[~.,...

.
.}
is a set of representations of the existen-.tial status of the individuals, and Tt~ is the teulpo-ral relationship between them.
This framework con-cerns the existential status of individuals such thatan individual exists at a certain space-time locationof the physical world.
For example, knowledge aboutan eventuality of forwarding is written as follows.
(r2) <:l~3lQ,{ll~ja, \[IQb}, '\]'\[{f> , wherel,;le: do: 7'gpc(.e\], Forward)&,Agcnt(*c:, *agcnt)&ltccp(*cj, *recp)&Objcct(*c\], *obj)&7'ime( *c : , *t : ),i iQa <le=r 7'ypc(*Cobj, t;'xi~t)&,Object(*eo~j, *obj),~.

Owner(,l ,  .p)means that person *p owns location */.
I assulne herethat the owner of a mail box is uniquely identified./it the ahove, \[l~\]a specifies the existenti~fi statusof *obj, whM1 is the object being forwarded, and saysthat *obj exists at time *to~j and at location *lobd,which the agent of forwarding owns.

The object thai;the recipient of forwarding receives is ,lot identifiedwith *obj becmlse of domestic onstraints concerningan e-mail system, lJgIi, says that *copy exists at time*tcopu and at lo('ation *le~py, which the recipient offorwarding owns.
3'l?.j says that the time: of forward-ing, *t j, must be during the time, *to,j, when .objexists, and that the time of forwarding, *t: nmst bebefore the time, *tcopy, when *copy exists.l(nowledge about an eventuality of deletiug is writ-ten as follows.

7'lQ says that the time when,obj exists must be immediately before the time ofdeleting.3.2  Resolving tempora l  re ferenceThis framework assumes that a representation of aneventuality described by a sentence is given, in therepresentation, pronominalized individuals an(l inde-terminate teml)oral relationships are represented asvariables uch as *agent1 ~md *rOll in (rl).
When therepresentation f the eventuality described by the cur-rent sentence is given, representations of the existen-tial status of individuals and temporal relationshipsbetween the eventuality amt the existential status ofindividuals are derived by using knowledge such gm1141(r2) and (r3).
These representations are interpretedwithin the context as described below.
In the interpre-tation process, appropriate constants are substitutedfor variables.
After the interpretation process, therepresentations are introduced into the context.
Thus,the context includes representations of eventnalities,the existential status of individuals, and temporal re-lationships among the eventualities and the existentialstatus of individuals that have been mentioned in a di-alogue.
In addition, it includes representations thatshow who is the speaker~ who is the hearer, what isthe speech time, and what is the time in the temporalfocus.Let RSet be a set of representations of an eventu-ality, E, described by a sentence, the existential statusof individuals mentioned in E, and temporal relation-ships between them.
The interpretation process is asfollows.
(I1) A representation, /~, in 12set is unified with arepresentation, R~, in the context, if possible.Through unification, constants in R~ are substi-tuted for variables in /C(i2) An indeterminate mporal relationship betweenthe time of eventuality E and the time in thetemporal focus is identified with the relevant tem-poral relation according to default interpretationrules and transitive and reflexive laws governingtemporal relationships.
(I3) Constants are generated and substituted for vari-ables that cannot be identified in steps (I1) and(I2) of this process.
(I4) Representations i  Rset are added to the context.Some nominal reference is resolved in (I1), al-though this paper does not go into how nominal ref-erence is resolved.In (I2), temporal reference is resolved.
The inter-pretation by transitive and reflexive laws governingtemporal relationships i preferred over the interpre-tation by default interpretation rules.This framework uses the defanlt interpretationrules (R1) and (R2), which are used in existing mod-els.
The default interpretation rules (R1) and (R2)are represented as the following theorems, (r4) and(r5) respectively, s(r4) Time(*ei, *ti)&NonStative(*e~)&Time( *et\] , *tt\] )&NonStative( *etf )&TempVocus(.t~/) D TRel(After, .t~, .its).

The followingtheorems are sufficient for dealing with dialogue (dl).

(rS) T~el(D,m.g, **, ,y) ~ :C~l(Co.~,i..~, w,  *~).The interpretation by the transitive and rellexivelaws governing temporal relationships can be regardedas a kind of of knowledge-based interpretation as de-scribed in sec.
2.1, although only a restricted set ofworld knowledge is used in this framework.
As demon-strated in see.
4, the interaction between references toindividuals and times plays an important role in re-solving temporal reference according to the transitiveand reflexive laws governing temporal ,:elationships.4 EXAMPLESThis section demonstrates how the framework worksby using sentence (s4) and (s5) as examples.
First,consider the interpretation of (s4) under the contextestablished by (s2).
Sentence (s2) introduces an even-tuality of deleting, Ed, into the context.
The eventu-ality is represented as follows.
(r9) Tyl)e( \]2,'d, Delete)&Agent( Ed, J ohn )&Objeet( lS d, M )&Time( Ed, Td)&NonStative(13d)&Be fore( IQ, 7;p).in (rg), M represents an individual, which is ane-mail message, Td represents the time of Ed, and ?\['~prepresents the time when sentence (s2) is uttered.
9By using knowledge (r3), the existential status,Era, of M and the temporal relationship between Edand Em are derived and introduced into the context.They are written as follows.
(rl0) Type( E.,, Exist)&Object( E,u, M)&Loc( t'Jm, Lm)&Owner( L.... J ohn )& Time( t'~'m , 5/;,~).
(,.11) :t'Rd( M ~et, 7;,~, T~)Tm represents the time when the e-mail messageM exists and L,~ represents the location of M.The context also includes the following represen-tation when (s4) is interpreted.
(r12) Speaker( John)&llearer(13ill).
(r 13) Spa e chTime ( T,p )& 7'e mp F ocus'( Td).Namely, I assume that the time of deleting~ Td, isin the temporal focus when (s4) is interpreted.Now, let me explain how sentence (s4) is inter-preted under the above context.
Sentence (s4) de-scribes an eventuality of forwarding, *ell , which iswritten ~ representation (rl) described in sac.
3.1.Likewise, by using knowledge @2), the following rep-resentations are derived.

(r17) T Rel( Be fore, *t f ~ , *t~o~vz ).In (rl),  *agentx, *rc.cpl and *objl represent re-spectively the pronominalized agent, recipient, andobject of fbrwarding.
Variable *reep~ is identifiedwith Bill by ,rallying \[learer(*recp~) in (rl) with(r12) in the coutext.Representation (r14) is unified with (rl0), ~?
andthen *ayent~ is identified with John and *obj\] is iden-tiffed with M. Likewise, *eobj ~, *lobj~, and *to~j~ areidentified respectively with Era, Lm and {g,,.Consequently, nominal reference in sentence (s4)is resolved.
As stated below, identifying *obji with3//serves to resolve temporal reference.By using (r13), variables, *t,~)~ and *tf ..... 1 areidentitied respectively with T.~ v and 7'd.The following temporal relationship is deriw;dfi'om (r16) bee~mse *objl is identitied with M and then*tobjl is identified with "/;,~.

'.l'ime( *t.w'~ )& Templ" ocus( *t f ..... 2).Here, I assume that (s5) directly describes the exis-tentiM status of an individual *obj.e, which is realizedas the zero-pronomlnalized subject in the sentence,mid that the existential status is construed as a stat, iveeventuality.
'\['he location, *l,,2, of *obj.e is specilied asa mail box that the hearer owns since the location isdesignated hy "sochira no mail 1oox (your mail box)".The time, *t.,.~, when *obj.e exists is before the speechtime since the past-.tense morpheme "ta" is used.
'\['he referent for *obj.2 is mnbiguous ince the refercnt can be either e-mail message M or its copy Copy.The relewmt reDrent muss he Copy.
As argued below,resolving this nominM reibrence is crucial in resolvingtemporal reference.I assume that the time of forwarding, 7}, is in thetemporal focus.
Resolving temporal reference heremeans dete.rmining temporal relationship *tel2 t)e~tween *t,2 and ~/}.
The relevant interpretation is th{~t?
t~.~ is after illt.Let me explain how the fi'amework interprets (sS).First of all, *person in (r26) is identified with Bill,since *person nmst be the hearer.
'\['hen *%2 in (r26)is identitied with E~ovy in (r23).
Likewise, *obj.e, *l,~u,and *t~.u are identified respectively with Copy, L~ovy,and Teovv.
Thus tim zero-pronominalized subject isappropriately interpreted.
As a result, the followingtemporal relationship is derived from (r26) since *t:,,p.is identified with "l'~ovy and 7} is in the temporal focus.0,27) 7 'Ied (*,'d~, :I'~o,,,~, '.l) ).llere, consider how the temporal relationship *tel2is determined.
By using default interpretation rule(rS), *rel.e is identilied with a relatkm, Contains,since the eventuality described by(s5) is stative.On the other hand, by using (r25) and theo-rem (rT), *rel.e is identified with a relation, After.
Inother words, the time of the eventuality deseribe.d by(sS) follows the time of forwarding.
This knowledge-based interpretation is l)referred over the default in--terpretation, and is the relevant interpretation.In the above process, identifying the pronominal-ized subject, *obj2, of (sS) with Copy is crucial forthe temporal reference resolution.
Assume that *obj~1143is identified with the e-mail message M. This casehappens when *ex2 in (r26) is identified with E,~ in(rl0) and *t~2 is identified with 7~.
In this case, thefollowing temporal relationship is derived from (r26).
(r28)T~el( .rel~, Tin, T~).By using (r24) and theorem (r8), *rel2 is identifiedwith a relation, Contains.
This interpretation is notrelevant.However, the case that leads to the wrong inter-pretation ever occurs.
When *e~2 is identified withEra, the following representation is derived from (r26)since *person is identified with Bill.
(r29) Loc( Em , *l~.
2 )&Owner( *l~ 2 , Bill).This representation is inconsistent with (rl0) sincethe owner of the location of the e-mail message Mmust be uniquely identified.
Thus, *e~.2 must be iden-tified with E~opy and then *obj2 must be identifiedwith Copy.Consequently, identifying appropriately the refer-ent of the pronominalized subject of sentence (s5) af-fects the process of resolving temporal reference, andthis reference interaction can be explained by exploit-ing knowledge such as (r2) and (r3).5 CONCLUSIONThis paper has made a twofold contribution to re-search on temporal reference resolution.
First, an ac-count of the role played by the reference interactionin resolving temporal reference is given.
As statedin see.
2, existing models cannot account for how theprocess of resolving nominal reference affects the pro-cess of resolving temporal reference since they do notexplain the reference interaction.
Second, it is shownthat exploiting the reference interaction clarifies howa restricted set of world knowledge (knowledge of thetemporal relationships between eventualities and theexistential status of individuals) contributes to theresolution process.
As stated in see.
2, existing mod-els resort to the entire set of causality knowledge.
I donot entirely deny the validity of the existing approach.However, when a restricted set of world knowledge issufficient o resolve temporal reference, immediate re-course to the entire set of world knowledge of causalitycan be avoided.
A framework is also presented, withinwhich temporal reference is resolved by exploiting thereference interaction.Future work will first extend the framework todeal with eventualities specified by various tense mor-phemes, whereas this paper focuses on eventualitiesspecified by the past-tense morpheme "ta".
Next, toexplore the notion of reference interaction in more de-tail, the way resolving temporal reference affects theresolution of nominal reference must be investigated,whereas this paper concentrates on the converse pro-cess.
Finally, the coverage of this framework must beevaluated.
Evaluation will require an exhaustive list-ing of possible cases of the existential status of indi-viduals that are used to resolve reference.
This paperaccounts for cases where an individual exists at a cer-tain space-time location of the physical world.
We canallow for other kinds of existential status, such as astatus where an individuM exists in the mental stateof a dialogue participant.
