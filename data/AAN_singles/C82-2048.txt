With i l i ) ,  a pragmat ice l~nent  appears:  the t rans format ion  in to  C E i s  poss ib le  on lyi f  we are  acqua in ted  wi th  the s i tuat ion  in  which E has beenut te red .A spec ia l  ca tegory  of  express ions  i s ,  from the semant icv iewpo in t ,  the category  of  " formal  express ions" ,  such as themathemat ica l  ones,  e .g .
,  "two t imes  three"  or  " four  minus two- 200 -equa ls  two" .
These express ions  a re  supposed  to  denote  d i rec t -l y  const ruct ions .2 ,  U_nder_st.and_i_n~, I t  may be s ta ted  that  there  i s  a ge -nera l  agreement among llngulsts, as well as among logicians,that understanding (in the semantic sense) is a relationbetween an individual and an expression.
Any explication must,however ,  spec i fy  th i s  re la t ion ,  With respect  to  what has  beensa id  above ,  there  are  two pr inc ipa l  poss ib i l i t i es  o f  such  aspecification-a) (the individual) A understands E iff A asociates Ewith the object (0 E) denoted by E!b) A understands E iff A associates E with the construct-tion (~)  expressed (or - in case of a mathematicalexpression - denoted) by E.Thus let A hear or read a sentence S. In the case a)we would say that A understands S iff he knows that S namesa proposition P. In the case b) we should say that A under-stands S iff he knows the construction C S that constructs P(or any structure preserving the meanings of "atomic express-ions" and isomorph with CS).It is clear that understanding in the sense of b)implies understanding in the sense of a) wherever both thesesenses are thinksble.We can show, however, that the implicat-ion does not hold vice versa.
Indeed, take the English sen-fence(S)  John  owns a cut lass  o r  he does  not  own a cut lass .Even those  who do  not  know what a cut lass  i s  w i l l  know that(S) denotes the proposition "verum", i.e., the propositionwhich is true in every possible world at every time moment.Thus not knowing the construction C S (because of not knowingan atom being part of it) the above individuals know theobject (i.eo, the proposition) denoted by (S).
One argumentagainst explloatlnE understanding in the sense a) is that wewould probably hesitate to say that who does not know themeaning of "cutlass" does all the same understand (S).- 201  -Another argument aga ins t  a) i s  s t r i c t ly  bound ~o ourconcept ion  and can be formulated ms fo l lows :  in  the case ofmathematical expressions a) is not applicable, since suchexpressions generally name constructions rather than objects.The last argument in favour of b) again refers to ourintuition: we feel that one can "more or less" understand anexpression.
This "more or less" is excluded if we connectunderstanding with the objects named by expressions (or~ atmost, we must confine ourselves to the cases of "more or less"clear meanings of particular atomic expressions).
When connect-ing understanding with constructions we can explicate tbls"more or less" rather intuitively.
We shall sketch this ex-plication (technical details are omitted again): Let thegiven expression E contain n "atomic", i.e., unanalyzablemeaningful (sub/expressions) including, as the case may be,the expressions from the category iii) ) el,...,e n. A necess-ary condition for A's understanding E (in the sense b) ) isthat A associated the appropriate atomic constructions, i.eo,objects with el,...,e n. (The second necessary conditionconsists in A's correct transformation of E into a construct-ion schema according to the grammar of the given language).Now, the degree of A's understanding E can be, among others,measured by 1 - k /n ,  where k i s  the number of  those subexpress -ions  among e l , .

)Thus i t  seems more appropr ia te  to accept  the pos i t ionb) and to c la im that  unders tand ing  i s  a re la t ion  between anind iv id~.a l  and an express ion  which ho lds  i f f  the ind iv idua lcor rec t ly  assoc ia tes  two s t ruc tured  ent i t ies :  the  grammatica l(o r :  tec togrammat ica l )  s t ruc ture  of  the express ion  and the( log ica l )  s t ruc ture  of  the cor respond ing  const ruc t ions- 202  -
