EXPLANATORY TEXT PLANNING IN LOGIC BASED SYSTEMSCLARISSE SIECKENIUS DE SOUZA 1PUC-Rio, Rio de Janeiro, BrazilMARIA DAS GRA(~AS VOLPE NUNESICMSC-USP, S~o Carlos, BrazilAbstractThis paper discusses aspects of theplanning of explanatory texts for logicbased systems.
It presents a method forderiving Natural Language text plans fromNatural Deduction-based structures.
Thisapproach allows for the planning ofexplanatory texts in a general-purposelogic based system framework, ensuring agreater degree of portability acrossdomains.1.
IntroductionFull exploration of resourcesoffered by knowledge-basedsystems (KBS's) is only possible iftheir interface is able to convey acomprehensible image of thesystem's reasoning.
Given theabstract and complex nature ofsuch reasoning, natural language(NL) text is an intuitive meansinterface designers choose toconvey the system's responses.The same line of thought isapplicable to the input side of theinterface system -- NL seems to beintuitively desirable to convey KBSusers' questions.
Consequently,the particular framework weenvisage here for human-computer interaction is one inwhich a NL interpreter convertsusers' ut terances into arepresentation language and a NLgenerator converts the system'sreasoning represented in thislanguage into NL text.Log ic -based  knowledgerepresentation techniques havethe advantage of being associatedto a formal language, whosesyntax and semantics is preciselydefined and which ensuresportability across domains.
Unlikewhat often happens with otherrepresentation techniques, suchas associative networks, in thiscase general methods can beconceived to translate any validsentence of the formal languageinto one or more valid sentencesin another language, includingnatural language.Our choice of a ND inferencesystem \[8\] is not arbitrary.
Previousresearch \[1\] has shown that NDrenders more understandableproofs than the algorithmicallymore efficient resolution basedsystems, for instance.
The outputof a ND-based automatic prover isa recursively generated tree,whose branches are qualified bypossibly different inference rules.The limited number of rule types,together with explicit principles tocombine them, allows for theidentification of proof patterns.Therefore, the input to the textgenerator of the interface systempresents a tow degree ofvariability, thus favoring the use ofthe schemata approach to textplanning.
For each pattern of proofthere is a corresponding pattern oftext.Moreover, as we will see, giventhat ND proofs are moreunderstandable,  only a fewstructural operations on the prooftrees are needed to account for thecontent selection step during theNL text planning process.ACTES DE COLING-92, NAIVI'ES, 23-28 AOt~l' 1992 7 4 2 PROC.

Deriving Text Plans fromNatural  Deduct ion  ProofTreesIn order to achieve the generationof coherent and cohesivemultisentential NL texts, ourprocessor performs two majorsteps: planning and realization.This separation is common toother approaches \[4,5\], and ismeant to manage tasks involved indeciding what to say at a differentstep than those involved indeciding how to say it.In terms of text planningparadigms, specifically, choicesrefer to either a rhetorical grammarbased approach -- which consistsOur approach differs from those ofMcKeown and Paris's \[7\] or Mooreand Swartout's \[5\], for example,because we use a theorem prover.It generates an idefinite numberand variety of schemata (prooftrees) instead of a limited set ofschemata known to the designer.This feature forces us to conceiveof transformational rules that willoperate systematically on ourschemata in order to turn them intoacceptable NL text plans.Additionally, although we generatetext plans dynamically by means ofstructural rules, our approach isalso different from other RST-based approaches such as thosesuggested by Scott and Souza \[9\],I\[A\] A - -~ BB ~Bre..L-i b)-AA -'--I~ B ~Bmt~A(a) (b)Figure I: Deriving Modus Tollensessentially of planning text in adynamic manner by using overallrhetorical structure rules combinedwith perlocutionary goals andusers' beliefs, as provided byRhetorical Structure Theory (RST)\[3\] -- or a schemata basedapproach -- which amounts toselecting among alternative pre-existing text structuring schemata,which are elaborated from ideal ortypical NL texts actually written forthe purposes at 'hand \[4,7\].
Wehave chosen the schemataapproach, although elements ofrhetorical structure rules arepresent and accessible to thesystem's reasoning.for example, because theelements included in thespecification of RST relations arenot computed bv the system toconstrain the application oftransformational rules.
They areused by the designer of the systemto map certain patterns found inthe proof trees to certain rhetoricalstructures.
So, it is not the casethat the system fully controls theselection of rhetorical relations, butit can, nevertheless, have accessto the reasons why the designerhas selected them -- it suffices tointerpret the specification of thepre-selected relations appearingin the derived schemata for agiven proof.ACRES DE COL1NG-92, NAbrI~:S, 23-28 Ao~I' 1992 7 4 3 PROC.

Both operationsprune the proof tree.
Factorizationapplies to a sequence of inferencerules involving the introduction orelimination of identical logicalconnectives.
The motivation for thefactorization is only to avoid thatderived text plans reflect in NLexpositions of the system'sreasoning a structure which is dueto a syntactic idiosyncrasy of alogical language.
So, for eachlogical connective (->, -, v, &), awhich cover the whole set ofderived rules \[6\], includingtautologies, De Morgan laws andsyllogisms.2.2.
From Proof Trees to TextP lansThe rhetorical structuring step iscarried out by means of mappingrules from ND subtrees to RSTschemata.
RST presents somekernel concepts we shouldemphasize here.
First, it proposesthat rhetorical relations bind twohierarchically different units: nucleiand satellites.
Nuclei carry themost important portion ofinformation to be conveyed in thetext span, whereas satellites carry~1 ~t2A ~A2-consequenceJ " .opposition ..,L (absurdity)nl n2(A )  ( -A )(a) (b)Figure II: An Example of a Mapping Rulefactorization is proposed to reducethe impact of the languagerepresentation syntax on the finaltext.Derivation rules affect contentselection by detecting logicargumentation patterns usuallyfound in common sensereasoning.
Such patterns,however, do not belong to the setof inference rules of a ND system,but fit naturally in the reasoningpath.
An instance of suchderivation rules is Modus Toflens.In Figure I (a), we see thecanonical ND derivation of ~A fromA->B and -B.
Rule (b) is derivedfrom pattern (a) in a systematicway.
In fact, we have formallydefined abstract proof patternsrelatively secondary information.The attribution of importance toinformational content is made bythe writer.
Second, rhetoricalrelations are specified in terms ofwriter's intentions and reader'sexpected reactions.A ND subtree corresponding to aninference rule application ismapped onto RST subtrees.
Theexample in Figure II shows themapping rule for the absurdity rule,where x denotes a derivation path.Notice that, whereas ND subtreeshave premises as leaves and aconclusion as the root, RSTsubtrees have information (ie.premises and conclusion) asleaves, and rhetorical relations asnodes.
The mapping rules areAcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 ^ ot'rr 1992 7 4 4 PROC.
OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992guided by the type of the inferencerule applied.
In our approach,nuclei are always the informationcorresponding to premises ofinference rules, and satellites, theconclusions.
For the purpose ofexposing the system's reasoning,the information about facts andaxioms that have caused theconclusion is more central than theconclusion itself.
It is worth sayingthat intermediary conclusions inthe proof tree have, in each step,the role of premises, due to therecursiveness of the structure.Mapping inference rules onto RSTstructures results in a text planwhich, if realized, is still far fromacceptable.
This is due to thea special mode.
In particular, thisis the case of hypothesisassumptions in ND-basedsystems, whose appropriatestructuring in rhetorical terms iscontext -sens i t i ve .
Oncehypotheses are raised, ND proofproceeds according to the sameset of rules as in any other case.Later on, when desired (partial)conclusions are achieved, thosehypotheses are discarded.
Ofcourse, discarding only makessense if raising is in topic.
So, thetext plan has to explicitly introducethe status of discardable premisesas hypotheses, so that whendiscarding is mapped onto arhetorical schema, the reader canrefer it to the hypothesizedsequencepurpose (schema ~(schema l~ ) conclude ( ~ )Figure II1: Antecipation of Reasoning Pathmethod of building text plans in arecursive fashion: in traversing theproof tree, inference rules arelocally translated into rhetoricalrelation schemata.
Also, ifrealization took place in aninterleaved way \[2\], the resultingtext plan could be sufficient foracceptable text rendit ion.However, since a sequentialmodel is assumed, enhancementsto this initial version of the text planhave to be made.Since text planning is the result ofrecursive context-free ruleapplication, some importantstructures that improve theunderstandability of the finaltextual exposition of the system'sreasoning have to be dealt with ininformation in topic.
This is donethrough the use of a Condit ionrelation at the top of the rhetoricalstructured schema.In fact, cases as the above-mentioned are related to discoursestructuring not at the level ofinformational content (ie.
proof+bound) proper, but rather at thelevel of the writer's perlocutionarygoals, such as c lar i ty,understandability and the like.Clearly, proof-derived mappingrules account for informationalcontent, but cannot fully ensure theachievement of perlocutionarygoals in writing.
This is why, insituations like assumption andordering of hypotheses, forexample, special mechanisms areAcrEs DL: COLING-92.

Another similar case isthat of repeating (ie.
re-introducingas  topic)  in fo rmat ioncorresponding to premiseslogically related to a conclusiveinformation, but linearly far fromthe point where that information ispresented.
The necessity of thiskind of rL.e_C_~ll may be derivedheuristically from the height of thecorresponding proof tree.A relevant point that has to beconsidered in planning long anddeductive texts is guiding thereader along the reasoning path.An interesting result of previousresearch \[6\] is that ND normalproof patterns offer the possibilityb_y__c_&~.
Proof by case is usedwhen the premise available to theprover is a disjunction, and theproof consists of deriving theconclusion from each of theelements of the disjunction,considered separately.
We show,in Figure V, the equivalent RSTstructure corresponding to the textplan in Figure IV.In the following, we propose apossible realization of the plan inEnglish, where the formulaeindexed by capital letters areinstantiated as NL sentences.Once again, it is worth noting thatat the present moment we areinvestigating realization rules and-X -X "~ (AvBvC)(AvBvC)\[A\] A -J~ D \[B\]B ~ ED D --),- T E E - - I~T T\[C\] C ~ FT F F --I~ TTTFigure IV: Proof by Caseof identifying a special type ofinformation (min imal  fo rmulae)which is uniquely related to bothpremises and conclusions.
Thisinformation is then used in textplanning to anticipate reasoningsteps.
The rhetorical schemawhich applies to this informationoperates at some sort of meta-level if compared to other RSTschemata.

Suppose thatthere is ozone depletion if+ theatmosphere; if so, the human immunesystem is depressed.
Therefore, humanlife is threatened.
Now, suppose that landundergoes desertification; ff so, the areaof productive land on earth is gettingsmaller.

ConclusionIn the present paper, we haveapproached text planning for thegeneration of explanatory NLanswers in logic based question-answering systems.
Assuming atwo step generation paradigm, wesoundness  and por tab i l i typrovided by a logic basedknowledge  representat iontechnique, supports the generationof better NL explanations of thequest ion-answer ing system'sreasoning.
In terms of the planningactivity, the rhetorical relationsand the rhetorical schemataderived from proofs provideelements for the explicit marking ofthe final text's coherence.AcrEs DE COLING-92, NAIffIES, 23-28 no(rr 1992 7 4 7 l)aoc.
