A metonymyis received as an input, then its possible inter-p retations are ranked by al)t)lying ~ statisticalmeasure.
The method has been tested experi-mentally.
It; correctly interpreted 53 out of 75metonymies in Jat)anese.1 I n t roduct ionMetonymy is a figure of st)eech in which tilename of one thing is substituted for that ofsomething to which it is related.
The czplicittc.~m is 'the name of one thing' and the implicitt;c~"m is 'the name of something to which it; isrelated'.
A typical examt)le of m(;tonymy isHe read Shal(esl)eare.
(1)'Slmkesl)(~are' is substitut(~d for 'the works ofShakespeare'.
'Shakest)eare' is the explicit termand 'works' is the implicit term.Metonymy is pervasive in natural language.The correc~ treatment of lnetonylny is vital tbrnatural language l)rocessing api)lications , es-1)ecially for machine translation (Kamei andWakao, 19!
)2; Fass, 1997).
A metonymy may beaecel)table in a source language but unaccet)t-able in a target language.
For example, a directtranslation of 'he read Mao', which is acceptablein English an(1 Japanese, is comt)letely unac-ceptal)le in Chinese (Kamei and Wakao, 1992).In such cases, the machine trmlslation systemhas to interl)ret metonynfies to generate accept-able translations.Previous approaches to processing lnetonymyhave used hand-constructed ontologies or se-mantic networks (.\]?ass, 1988; Iverson and Hehn-reich, 1992; B(maud et al, 1996; Fass, 1997).
11As for metal)her l)rocessing, I 'errari (1996) used t;ex-Such al)t)roaches are restricted by the knowl-edge bases they use, and may only be applicableto domain-specific tasks because the construc-tion of large knowledge bases could be very d i fficult.The method outlined in this I)apcr, on theother hand, uses cortms statistics to interpretmetonymy, so that ~ variety of metonynfiescan be handled without using hand-constructedknowledge bases.
The method is quite t)romis-ing as shown by the exl)erimental results givenin section 5.2 Recogn i t ion  and  In terpretat ionTwo main steps, recognition and i'ntc.
'q~vc-ration, are involved in the processing ofmetonyn~y (Fass, 1.!)97).
in tile recognition st;el),metonylnic exl)ressions are labeled.
1111 the in-tel'l)r(:tation st;el) , the meanings of those ext)res-sions me int, eri)reted.Sentence (1), for examl)le, is first recognizedas a metonymy an(t ~Shakespeare' is identifiedas the explicit term.
't'he interpretation 'works'is selected as an implicit term and 'Shakespeare'is replaced 1)y 'the works of Shakespeare'.A conq)rehensive survey by Fass (\]997) showsthat the most COllllllOll metho(1 of recogniz-ing metonymies i by selection-restriction vio-lations.
Whether or not statistical approachescan recognize metonymy as well as the selection-restriction violation method is an interestingquestion.
Our concern here, however, is theinterpretation of metonymy, so we leave thatquestion for a future work.In interpretation, an implicit term (or terms)that is (are) related to the explicit term is (are)selected.
The method described in this paperuses corpus st~tistics for interpretation.tual clues obtained through corl)us mmlysis tor detectingmetal)lmrs.885This method, as applied to Japanesemetonymies, receives a metonymy in a phraseof the tbnn 'Noun A Case-Marker R PredicateV' and returns a list of nouns ranked in or-der of the system's estimate of their suitabilityas interpretations of the metonylny, aSSulningthat noun A is the explicit tenn. For exam-ple, given For'a  wo (accusative-case) kau (buy)(buy a Ford),  Vay .sya (ear), V .st .sdl  ,r'uma (vehicle), etc.
are returned, in that order.Tile method fbllows tile procedure outlinedbelow to interpret a inetonymy.1.
Given a metonymy in the form 'Noun ACase-Marker R Predicate V', nouns thatcan 1)e syntactically related to the explicitterm A are extracted from a corpus.2.
The extracted nouns are rmlked accordingto their appropriateness a interpretationsof the metonymy by applying a statisticalmeasure.The first step is discussed in section 3 and thesecond in section 4.3 In fo rmat ion  Source\?e use a large corpus to extract nouns whichcan be syntactically related to the exl)licit termof a metonylny.
A large corpus is vahmble as asource of such nouns (Church and Hanks, 1990;Brown et al, 1992).We used Japanese noun phrases of the fornlA no B to extract nouns that were syntacticallyrelated to A. Nouns in such a syntactic relationare usually close semantic relatives of each other(Murata et al, 1999), and occur relatively infre-quently.
We thus also used an A near B rela-tion, i.e.
identifying tile other nouns within thetarget sentence, to extract nouns that may bemore loosely related to A, trot occur more fre-quently.
These two types of syntactic relationare treated differently by the statistical nleasurewhich we will discuss in section 4.The Japanese noun phrase A no B roughlycorresponds to the English noun phrase B of A,lint it has a nmch broader ange of usage (Kuro-hashi and Sakai, 1999).
In fact, d no B can ex-press most of the possible types of semmltic re-lation between two nouns including metonymic2~Ford' is spelled qtSdo' ill Japanese.

For exam-ple, Shakc.spcare wo yomu (read) (read Shake-speare) is regarded as a contraction of Shake-speare no .sakuhin (works) 'wo yomu (read theworks of Shakespeare), where A=Shake.spcare,Q=no, B=.sakuhin, R=wo,  and V=yomu.Given a metonymy in the fbrln A R 17, theappropriateness of noun B as an interpretationof the metonymy under the syntactic relation Qis defined byLQ(BIA,/~, V) - Pr(BIA, (2, 1~, V), (2)ayamamoto et al (\]998) also used A no /3 relationto interpret metonymy.886where Pr( .

represents l)robal/ility and Q iseither an A no B relation or an A near \]3 re-lation.
Next;, the appropriateness of noun \]3 isdefined byM(BIA, Ie, V) -nlaxLc~(BIA, l~,V ).
(3)OWe rank nouns 1)y at)plying the measure 214.Equation (2) can be decomposed as follows:LQ(!31A, R,, V)= Pr (B IA  , Q, R,, V)Pr(A, Q, B, R,, V)Pr( A, Q, R, v)Pr(A, Q, 13)lh'(R, VIA, Q, Ix)Pr(A, Q) Pr(R, VIA, Q)Pr(BIA , Q)Pr(R, VIB)-~ er(R, v) ' (4)where (A, O) and {\]~,, V} are assumed to l)e in-del)endent of each other.Let f(event)1)e the frequen(:y of an cve'nt andClassc.s(\])) be the set of semantic (:lasses towhich B belongs.

More Sol)histieated methods (M;mning ml(tSchiitze, 1999) of smoothing f)robability distributionm~y I)e I)eneticial.
itowever, al)l)lying such methodsand comparing their effects on the interpretation ofmetonymy is beyond the scope of this l)aper.This t reatment  does not alter the order of thenouns ranked by the syst;em because l?r(H., V)is a constant for a given metonymy of the formAR V.Equations (5) and (6) difl'er in their t reatmentof zero frequency nouns.
In Equat ion (5), anoun B such that  f (A ,  Q, B) = 0 will l)e ignored(assigned a zero probal)ility) because it is un-likely that  such a noml will have a close relation-shii / with noun A.
In Equation (6), on the otherhand, a noun B such that  f (B ,  R, V) = 0 is as-signed a non-zero probability.
These treatmentsreflect the asymmetrical  proper~y of inetonymy,i.e.
ill a nletonylny of the form A 1{ 1~ animplicit term 13 will have a much t ighter rela-tionship with the explicit term A than with thepredicate V. Consequently, a nouil \]3 such thatf (A ,Q ,  B) >> 0 A f (B ,  JR, V) = 0 may be ap-propri~te as an interpretation of the metonymy.Therefore, a non-zero t)robat)ility should be as-sign(;d to Pr(l~., VI1X ) ev~,n it' I (B ,  2e, V) ; ().
~Equation (7) is the probabil ity that  noun J3occurs as a member of (::lass C. This is reduced tofU~) if13 is not ambiguous, i.e.
IC/a,~,sc.,s,(/3)\[ = f(c)1.
If it is ambiguous, then f (B )  is distr ibutedequally to all classes in Classes(B).The frequency of class C is ol)tained simi-larly:.f(B) (8).
f (c )  = ~ ICl(-~c..~(13)1' 11C-.
(7where 13 is a noun which belongs to the class C.Finally we derivef(13, ~, v)BqC(.0)In summary,  we use the measure M as de-fined in Equat ion (3), and cah:ulated by apply-ing Equat ion (4) to Equation (9), to rank nounsaccording to their apl)ropriateness as possibleinterpretat ions of a metonymy.Example  Given the statistics below, bottle weakeru (open) (open a bottle) will be interpreted5The use of Equation (6) takes into account a noun/3such that J'(l:~, l{, V) = 0.
But, Stlch & llOtlll is usually ig-nored if there is another noun B' such that f(13', H., V) >0 be~,~,,se.
Eo'~ct ....... U~)P, USIO)J'(C,~e.,V) << a <J'(lY, H,, V) will usually hokl.
This means thai the co-occurrence 1)rol)al)iliW between implicit terms and verbsare also important in eliminating inapl)rol)riate nomls.887as described in the fbllowing t)aragraphs, assum-ing that cap and rcizSko (refl'igerator) are thecandidate implicit terms.Statistics:f(bottlc, no, cap) = 1,f(bottlc, no, reizgko) = O,f(bottlc, no) = 2,f ( bottlc, ncar, cap) = 1,f (bottle, near, rciz6ko) = 2,f(bottlc, ncar) = 503,f(cap) = 478,f(rcizSko) = 1521,f(cap, wo, akcru) = 8, andf(rciz6ko, wo, akcru) = 23.f(bottlc, no, rciz6ko) = 0 indicates that bottleand rcizSko are not close semantic relatives ofeach other.
This shows the effectiveness of us-ing A no B relation to filter out loosely relatedwords.Measure:L,o(cap)Lncar(Cap) =Lno(reizSko) =Lncar ( reizS ko ) -~f ( bott:le, no, cap).f ( bottlc, no)\](ca,p, wo, a\]~c'ru)X1 8-8 .37?10 -3 ,2 478f (bottle, near, cap)f(bottlc, near)f ( caI), "wo, a\]~cru)X.f ( )1 850--3 47-8 = 3.33 ?

10 -5 ,where L,,o(Cap) = L,~o(Caplbo~tle, wo, akeru),M(c p) = M(c pl ot tz , and so o51.Since M > M we concludethat cap is a more appropriate imt)licit termthan rcizSho.
This conclusion agrees with ourintuition.5 Exper iment5 .1  Mater ia lMetonymies  Seventy-five lnetonymies wereused in an ext)erilnent to test tile prol)osedlnethod.
Sixty-two of them were collected fromliterature oll cognitive linguistics (Yamanashi,1988; Yamam~shi, 1995) and psycholinguistics(Kusumi, 1995) in Japanese, paying attentionso that the types of metonymy were sufficientlydiverse.
The remaining 13 metonymies weredirect translations of the English metonymieslisted in (Kalnei and Wakao, 1992).
These 13metonylnies are shown in Table 2, along withthe results of the experiment.Corpus  A corpus which consists of sevenyears of issues of the Mainichi Newspaper (Dora1991 to 1997) was used in the experiment.
Thesentences in tlle cortms were mort)hologicallyanalyzed by ChaSen version 2.0b6 (Matsumotoet al, 1999).
The corpus consists of about 153million words.Semant ic  Class A Japanese thesaurus, Bun-rui Goi-tty6 (The N~tional Language ResearchInstitute, 1996), was used in the experiment.
Ithas a six-layered hierarchy of abstractions andcontains more than 55,000 nouns.
A class wasdefined as a set of nouns which are classified inthe same abstractions in the top three layers.The total nmnber of classes thus obtained was43.
If a noun was not listed in the thesaurus, itwas regarded as being in a class of its own.8885.2 Method'.1.11(; method we have dcseril)e,d was applied I;Othe metonynfie, s (lescril)e,(t ill section 5.1.

However, it is notconcerned with the semantic relation betweenan explicit; term and implicit term, because suchsemantic relations are not directly expressed illcorpora, i.e.
noun phrases of the form A noB can be found in corpora bul; their senmnticrelations are not.
If we need such semantic re-lations, we must semantical ly analyze the nounphrases (Kurohashi and Sakai, 1999).App l i cab i l i ty  to  o ther  languages  Japan-ese noun phrases of the form A no B are specitieto Japanese.
The proposed method, however,could easily be extended to other languages.
Forexmnple, in English, noun phrases B of d couldbe used to extract semantical ly related nouns.Nouns related by is-a relations or par t -o f  re-lations could also be extracted from corpora(Hearst, 1992; Berland and Charniak, 1999).
Ifsuch semantical ly related nouns are extracted,then they can be ranked according to the mea-sure M defined in Equat ion (3).Lex ica l ly  based  approaches  GenerativeLexicon theory (Pustejovsky, 1995) proposedthe qualia structure which encodes emantic re-lations among words explicitly.
It is useflfl toinfer an implicit term of the explicit term ina metonymy.
The proposed approach, on theother hand, uses corpora to infer implicit termsand thus sidesteps the construction of qualiastructure.
