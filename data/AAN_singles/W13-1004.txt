Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Multiword Expressions (MWE 2013), page 31,Atlanta, Georgia, 13-14 June 2013. c?2013 Association for Computational LinguisticsComplex Predicates are Multi-word ExpressionsMartha PalmerDepartment of LinguisticsUniversity of Colorado at Boulder295 UCBBoulder, Colorado 80309-029, USAMartha.Palmer@colorado.eduAbstractPractitioners of English Natural Language Process-ing often feel fortunate because their tokens areclearly marked by spaces on either side.
However,the spaces can be quite deceptive, since they ignorethe boundaries of multi-word expressions, such asnoun-noun compounds, verb particle constructions,light verb constructions and constructions from Con-struction Grammar, e.g., caused-motion construc-tions and resultatives.
Correctly identifying and han-dling these types of expressions can be quite chal-lenging, even from the viewpoint of manual anno-tation.
This talk will review the pervasive nature ofthese constructions, touching on Arabic and Hindi aswell as English.
Using several illustrative examplesfrom newswire and medical informatics, current bestpractices for annotation and automatic identificationwill be described, with an emphasis on contributionsfrom predicate argument structures.About the SpeakerMartha Palmer is a Professor of Linguistics andComputer Science, and a Fellow of the Institute ofCognitive Science at the University of Colorado.Her current research is aimed at building domain-independent and language independent techniquesfor semantic interpretation based on linguisticallyannotated data, such as Proposition Banks.
She hasbeen the PI on NSF, NIH and DARPA projects forlinguistic annotation (syntax, semantics and prag-matics) of English, Chinese, Korean, Arabic andHindi.
She has been a member of the AdvisoryCommittee for the DARPA TIDES program, Chairof SIGLEX, Chair of SIGHAN, a past President ofthe Association for Computational Linguistics, andis a Co-Editor of JNLE and of LiLT and is on theCL Editorial Board.
She received her Ph.D. in Arti-ficial Intelligence from the University of Edinburghin 1985.31
