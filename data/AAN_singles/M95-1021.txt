WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY : DESCRIPTION ofthe UNO NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSINGSYSTEM as USED for MUC- 6Lucja Iwanska, Mary Croll, Taewan Yoon, Maria Adam sWayne State UniversityDepartment of Computer ScienceDetroit, Michigan 48202, US Alucja@cs.wayne.eduph .
(313) 577-1667, fx : (313) 577-686 8INTRODUCTIO NOur Research Hypothesi sThe UNO natural language processing (NLP) system implements a Boolean algebra computational model o fnatural language [Iwadska, 1992] [Iwanska, 1993] [Iwanska, 1994] [Iwanska, 1996b] and reflects our researc hhypothesis that natural language is a very expressive, yet computationally tractable knowledge representa-tion and reasoning system with its own representational and inferential machinery .
One of our goals is t oexperimentally demonstrate that an NLP system that closely parallels the representational and inferentia lcharacteristics of natural language allows one to achieve an in-depth processing (eg ., querring automaticall yfrom texts created knowledge bases or entity classification), with close-to-real-time, high-recall-and-precisio nperformance .Why and What for MUC- 6MUC6 Tasks Not Inconsistent with Our Goal sWe view the MUC6 tasks as not inconsistent with our goal of providing further experimental evidence i nsupport of our research hypothesis .
Also, we have been conducting experiments in non-committal process-ing with controlled resource allocation such as exploiting local interpretations, taking advantage of loca lcontexts, and performing expensive computations such as disambiguation only if needed .
We have alsobeen experimenting with flexible processing such as undoing various decisions and independent processin gof related tasks .
The NE MUC-6 task is a good test for such experiments .Coreference?
Most Interesting Tas kWe were particularly interested in the coreference task, with the NE task largely considered as a preparatio nstage for it because :1.
Reference resolution is critical for processing pretty much any text in any domain ;2.
We believe that mechanism for resolving references to named entities is basically the same regardles sof the entities' types .
Identifying certain named entities and therefore resolving references to themmay be facilitated by the availability of extra constraints on the beginning or the end of the name .For example, identifying personal and company names is facilitated by the fact that personal name soften start with a title such as "Ms ."
and company names often end with a corporate extension suchas "Ltd" .2633 .
We are in the process of demonstrating that it is natural language for acquiring knowledge, and no tacquiring knowledge in order to process natural language .
Our very encouraging preliminary resultsshow that definite anaphora facilitates acquisition of taxonomic knowledge [Iwanska, 1996a], includin gthe "type-subtype" and "part-subpart" relations .
These results demonstrate that approaches to definiteanaphora resolution that rely primarily on the availability of such knowledge, a standard approach i nall NLP systems we are aware of, are misguided .Successful Techniques for Developing and Testing In-Depth Processing Large Number of TextsFinally, by participating in MUC6 we hoped to share our experience and learn from the other participant sabout successful techniques for developing and testing in-depth processing for a large, more than two thou -sands, number of texts and for developing large knowledge bases .UNO MODEL OF NATURAL LANGUAG EClosely Mimics Representation and Reasoning Inherent in Natural Languag eThe UNO model closely mimics the representation and reasoning inherent in natural language because it stranslation procedure, data structures of the representation, and inference engine are motivated by th esemantics and pragmatics of natural language .
One payoff of this close correspondence to natural languag eis the capability of automatically creating and querring knowledge bases from textual documents' .Sentences asserting properties of (sets of) individuals, sentences describing subtyping relations, includin gextentional type definitions, as well as intensional definitions of concepts such a s1. "
John is a neither good nor hard-working nurse " , "Not many students did welt'2.
"Dobermans, poodles and terriers are dogs "3.
"Elephant?
a huge, thick-skinned, mammal with very few hairs, with a long, flexible snout, and tw oivory tusks"are uniformly represented by the following type equations :type == { < P1i TP1 >, < P2 ,TP2 >, .
.
., < Pn,TPn > }Their left-hand side, "type", is the representation of a noun phrase, the largest type, or the name of aconcept; the right-hand side is a two-element set : a property value P, and TP- a set of < t, p > element srepresenting the fact that the property value P holds at a temporal interval t with the probability p .Individual property values, temporal intervals and probabilities are represented by the sets [a l , a 2 , .
.
., an ]whose elements a, are terms, record-like structures consisting of a head, a type symbol, and a body, a listof attribute-value pairs: attribute => value .
For exr?nple, a complex noun "sick, very unhappy woman" i srepresented b y[ woman( health => sick ,happy => (not happy)(degree => very)) ]whose only term has the type "woman" as its head and two attributes : "health" with the value sick ; "happy"with the value (not happy)(degree => very) .
Semantically, this data structure represents this subset o findividuals of the type "woman" for which the attribute "health" has the value "sick" and the function"happy" has the value "very unhappy' .Various relations such as entailment or its dual subsumption (set-inclusion) and negation (set-complement )are automatically computed, and the intuitively and formally correct results are guaranteed to hold .
TheUNO NLP system uses such type equations bi-directionally : for answering questions about the propertiesof a particular individual, and for matching particular properties against the properties of individuals in it sknowledge base .
'Needless to say, limited by the subset of English covered by the model .264Solid Computational and Mathematical Framework in Tact with Linguistic The-oriesThe UNO representation offers a solid computational and mathematical framework in tact with linguisti ctheories .
Updating knowledge base and automated inferencing is done by the same semantically clea ncomputational mechanism of performing Boolean operations on the representation of natural language inpu tand the representation of previously obtained information stored in the knowledge base .The underlying knowledge representation formalisms with the computable Boolean algebras with set -theoretic and interval-theoretic semantics allows one to capture semantics of different syntactic categorie sbecause sets and intervals underlie semantics of many syntactic categories : common nouns, intransitive verbs ,and adjectives can be thought of as denoting sets of persons or objects that possess properties denoted b ythe words; adjectives and adverbs are functions mapping sets of objects into sets of objects ; determiners arefunctions mapping sets of objects into sets of sets of objects, and the denotations of proper nouns are set sof sets of objects [Dowty et al., 1981] [Barwise and Cooper, 1981] [Keenan and Faltz, 1985] [Hamm, 1989] .The same machinery is used as a metalanguage for describing and propagating arbitrary Boolean con-straints, including dictionary entries describing morphological and grammatical constraints .
The data struc-tures are partially specified, negative constraints are propagated via unification, and the nonmonotonicityof negation [Pereira, 1987] is not problematic .The UNO model shares many computational characteristics with the programming language LIF E[Ait-Kaci and Richard Meyer and Peter Van Roy, 1993] because the efficiently computable calculus that un-derlies LIFE [Kit-Kaci, 1986] is extended in the UNO model to handle negation and generalized quantifies .Some of the linguistic theories that the UNO model encompasses and (or) extends include insights of th eMontague semantics of natural language [Montague, 1973] [Dowty et al., 1981], the Boolean algebra mathe-matical models of [Keenan and Faltz, 1985], the theory of generalized quantifiers [Barwise and Cooper, 1981 ][Hamm, 1989], the theory of the pragmatic inference of quantity-based implicature of [Horn, 1972] [Horn, 1989] ,and the theory of negation in natural language of [Horn, 1989] .Recent Extension?
Temporal ReasoningWe have recently extended the UNO model to incorporate temporal reasoning .
This extension demonstratesthat important inferences about time can be captured by a general representation and reasoning mechanisminherent in natural language, many aspects of which are closely mimicked by the UNO model .
We haveshown that computing logical, context-independent and non-monotonic, context-dependent inferences fo rtemporal and non-temporal objects is almost exactly analogous .Theory and Practis eWe are committed to addressing research problems with a strong promise for facilitating processing natura llanguage input .
For example, we had decided to extenn the UNO model of natural language to handl etemporal information because virtually all real-life tasks involve handling some aspects of time .
There is alarge body of existing work on morphologically marked time and aspect, but we had decided against handlingthis type of temporal information because it necessarily requires high recall and precision of performin gsentential-level parsing, a task that no NLP system, including our system, can perform well .
Instead, wehad decided to address temporal information from explicit temporal expressions because we can extremel yreliably recover such expressions via local parsing .Our natural-language-based temporal reasoner was developed and tested on more than three hundred s1989 " Wall Street Journal' articles .
We somewhat randomly chose a batch of 300 WSJ articles and usingSGML-like marks, an opening mark < TE > and a closing mark < /TE >, we had marked all expression sof different syntactic categories that contained any information pertaining to time .
Incidentaly, the numberof articles coincides with the number of the MUC-6 development data .Our temporal reasoner automatically extracts explicit temporal expressions from on-line textual docu-ments and creates their representation .
This representation allows the system to compute entailed logical ,context-independent, deductive inferences and facilitates computing context-dependent, non-monotonic in-ferences, including implicature, specialization, and generalization .265For any set of English temporal expressions, their information content can be computed and compared ,which allows the system to compute answers to the "Yes-No" questions about various aspects of time ,answers to the "When ?
', "How long ?'
and "How often ?'
queries of the resulting knowledge base and, t oa limited extent, temporal ordering of the events described in the documents .UNO NLP SYSTEMIn this section, we briefly comment on the most distinct characteristics of our system, as requested by th eMUC-6 program committee ; technical details can be found in the references provided earlier .
Wheneverpossible, we illustrate our system's capabilities with the examples from the walkthrough article .Demonstrated by the pre-MUC6 Research and ImplementationReasoning with Explicit Negative, Disjunctive, and Conjunctive Information at All SyntacticLevelsOne consequence of this rather unique capability is flat taxonomies; complex Boolean types need not bestored explicitly, which prevents the unnecessary, but common, exponential growth of a knowledge base .
Forexample, the UNO system does not need to explicitly store the entailment (subsumption) relation betwee nthe complex disjunctive type "power-boat or sail-boat' and the lexically-simple type "boat" because thisrelation is directly (and cheaply) computed from the UNO representation of these two expressions, commo nnouns in this case .Flat taxonomies are highly desirable because, among others, they facilitate the ease and quality increas eof knowledge base maintenance .Handling general negation in natural language allows the UNO system to correctly compute possibl einterpretations of the sentence "Mr. Dooner doesn't see a creative malaise permeating the agency", one ofwhich is that Mr. Dooner sees something else .
This correct interpretation is automatically preferred by thesystem because of the context created by the immediately following sentence "He points to several campaignswith pride, including the Taster's Choice commercials that are like a running soap opera " .Adverbial and Adjectival Modification at All Syntactic LevelsAdverbial and adjectival modification also contributes to the flatness of our taxonomies .
For example, theUNO system automatically computes the relations between the following pairs of expressions denoting typesand qualitative frequency values :"smooth process""not very smooth process""no immediate plans""plans""huge models""small model?
"unusual""not extremely unusual"Nonstandard QuantifiersSome of the nonstandard quantifiers that our system can handle include vague quantifiers involving th edeterminer "many" .
The UNO system automatically computes relations between the following expressions :"many differences"" very many differences""not very many differences"Reasoning with Uncertainty and Qualitative Probabilistic Reasoning without Underlying Nu-meric ValuesJust like the other systems participating in MUC-6, our system often misses a high-level relation betwee nentities described in a sentence because our parser does not attempt or fails to compute full sentential-leve lparsing.
However, even without such a quality parse, the system is capable of automatically computin grelations such as the relation between the following two expression s"possible acquisition?
"possible, but not very likely, acquisitions"266While the lack of a quality parse may prevent the system from understanding a high-level relation, i nthis case, what exactly was said about possible acquisitions, it understands the difference between "possible ,but not very likely" and "possible " acquisitions .Temporal ReasoningThe UNO system does not only identify explicit temporal expressions, but also automatically reasons wit hthem .
Some of the expressions uniquely handled by our system include the following :1.
Temporal frequency quantifiers"Not very often""Very often "2.
Infinite number of temporal relations"Not in the immediate future" "immediately precedes ""Shortly before or after""Not long before""Five or sir days before "3.
Uncertain and underspecified (explicitly negative) temporal information"It did not happen on April 22, 1992""X happened in April, 1992, or X happened in May, but not early May, 1992"Reasoning with Underspecified InformationThe UNO system computes the fact that the following expressions differ in their information content an dthat the first has strictly more information than the second :"X happened in May, 1992""X happened in May, but not early May, 1992'Automatic Combination of InformationOur system offers a highly efficient Boolean "meet" operation which is mathematically guaranteed to com-bine information in the most general way .
This UNO operation provides an alternative to ad-hoc mergin gemployed by many other systems .
We must note, however, that currently this advantage of our system i srarely realized in practise because it strongly depends on a correct, quality parse of input sentences .Uniform Natural-Language-Based Representation of Taxonomic and Temporal ReasoningAs we explain later, this uniformity of our representation greatly simplifies our architecture and control .Work Done during June-October 199 5Below we elaborate on the work done between the end of June and beginning of October 1995 .
We brieflycomment on the scope, importance and quantity of the tasks we had decided to do .1 .
Implemented changes necessary to participate in MUC6For example, before MUC-6, the UNO system was preserving the exact image of the input text, but i tdid not keep track of the correspondence between the resulting knowledge base and the actual pieces o finput text from which the knowledge base resulted .
For MUC-6, we had to redesign our bookkeepin gstructures in order to be able to do this .
We devoted a considerable effort to this task because such achange directly affects every processing stage .Another piece of code we had to develop were functions for chosing markables and outputting SGML -tagged text .2672 .
Improved the accuracy of identifying unmarked sentential boundariesOur pre-MUG6 system was quite good in correctly identifying sentential boundaries in newspaperarticles .
A simple list of 200-or-so standard abbreviations and the sensitivity to the most commo noccurences of periods in numbers was largely responsible for this good performance .
We wanted thesystem to perform this task near-perfectly because it would improve this generally needed capabilit yand because based on the existing literature, we expected the distance expressed in a number o fsentences to be a very important factor in computing pronominal referents .3 .
Improved handling punctuationIt is fair to say that before MUC-6, we largely ignored, as opposed to handled, punctuaction .
Nowwe can say that we can handle periods, exclamations, most unpaired singlequotes, most commas, an dsome dashes.
While handling punctuation is good in general, specifically for MUC-6, it is needed fo rprocessing numbers and facilitating identification of apposites .4 .
Completed half-built semantic hierarchy of structured geographical knowledge .The UNO NLP hierarchy of geographical knowledge contains major geographical information abou tall countries, including capital cities, major and important cities, towns, ports, suburbs, local settle-ments, geographical and political regions that divide land such as provinces, islands, major ports an dairports, landmarks, monetary, length, area, and volume systems, official languages, major politica lorganizations, waters such as seas, lakes, and rivers, and geographical landmarks and points of interes tsuch as mountains, hills, woods, and national parks .This geographical knowledge is encoded in our uniform, general-purpose UNO knowledge representa -tion; UNO NLP system supports geographical reasoning with its general inferencing mechanism .We certainly did not need to do this for MUC-6, a simple gazetteer list would do (an approach adopte dby most MUC-6 participants) .
However, we put a lot of effort into encoding this hierarchy because :(a) With the existence of this hierarchy, we further substantiate our claim that natural language i sa powerful and efficient knowledge representation system and add geographical knowledge to th elist of uniformly represented and reasoned about types of knowledge .
Right now, our system canreason about geographical region containment in the exact analogous fashion as about type subse trelation and temporal interval containment .
(b) We wanted to demonstrate that the same in-depth mechanism of some aspects of geographica lreasoning can be efficiently used to perform a much lesser, MUG6-like task of marking locations .5 .
Identified common named types, including organization types and existing named entitiesWe identified more than 100 types other than the type "organization" and developed sizable knowledgebases and dictionaries with the actual existing, classified named entities of these types .
We decided t odo it in order to experimentally substantiate our belief that reference mechanism for named entities o fdifferent types is basically the same for all entity types, and that references can be computed by thesame piece of code .6 .
Implemented numbers and personal name sOur effort of making the UNO system process numbers and improving handling personal names wa sstrictly related to MUC-6 .7 .
Developed and tested a general approach to handling abbreviations, acronyms and aliasesWe spent much more effort on abbreviations, acronyms and aliases than originally planned .
First ,such short forms are very common in written language.
Second, handling such short forms resemble shandling semantic ambiguity.
And third, short forms fit with our ongoing research on context .8 .
Implemented quick-and-dirty pronoun resolutio nWhile this code appears to perform well, it breaks occasionally and needs to be further debugged .268DictionaryINL InputDictionaryentriesMetaDictionaryKnowledge RepresentationBooleanAlgebrasKBInterpreterParse rtGrammarStati cKnowledgeDynamicKnowledge InferenceEngineLearningDiscourse-------------------------------------I1Figure 1 : Modules of the UNO natural language processing systemUNO ArchitectureThe practical significance of the uniformity of the UNO natural-language-based representation and inference ,is a simple and flexible architecture of our NLP system :1.
All UNO modules access the knowledge representation module and share its uniform representation .2.
There is no need for external specialists such as knowledge representation systems or temporal rea-soners .
Our system uniformly represents and reasons with taxonomic, temporal and geographica lknowledge .3.
With no external specialists, no interfaces to access them are needed, and therefore there is no need t otranslate between incompatible representations .An NLP system that needs to perform tasks beyond information extraction and to exhibit some in-depth processing such as question answering virtually always calls some external specialists, typicall yknowledge representation systems .
As reported in the literature, the necessity to translate between th erepresentation of the NLP system and such an external specialist is very hard to do and it tremendousl ycomplicates control [Palmer et al., 1993] [exp, 1996] .269UNO NLP Module sThe UNO NLP system consists of the following modules : Reader, Dictionary, Parser, KnowledgeRepresentation, Discourse, and Learning .The first three, Reader, Dictionary, and Parser, are modules of the BILING system, a NI.P sys-tem processing a large number of narratives written by bilingual English/Spanish students [Iwaiiska, 1989] .The changes to these old modules include augmenting the parser to produce the UNO representation of sen-tences, enhancing the morphological analyzer to handle prefixes, and supplying the reader with structures forstoring the information gained at various stages of processing .
The Knowledge Representation modul eimplements the theory behind the UNO model of natural language .The Reader module contains functions for breaking input text into documents, paragraphs, sentences,and words .
It recognizes abbreviated phrases, contractions, punctuation etc .
This module also containsfunctions for creating various structures from strings and LISP s-expressions, and routines for initializin gglobal variables used by other modules .The Dictionary module contains functions for creating, updating, loading and checking consistenc yof the UNO dictionary, and functions for performing morphological analysis of the input .
Metaknowledg eabout the dictionary describes its content : it lists known features, specifies feature applicability to differen tsyntactic categories, describes possible and default values of different features (the default values are no tshown explicitly in the entries) .
This metaknowledge facilitates maintaining consistency of the dictionary .The dictionary is used by the morphological analyzer for supplying each input word with syntactic ,semantic, and pragmatic information .
The morphological analyzer can recognize and generate various form sof nouns and verbs, for example, cry, cries, crying, cried, adjectives, for example, angrier, derive adverb sfrom adjectives, for example, slowly, etc .
The morphological analyzer handles both prefixes, eg .
the prefixim in the word impossible, and suffixes, eg .
less in the word brainless .The Parser module contains functions implementing a chart parser [Winograd, 1983] [Earley, 1985] .The parser produces both syntactic parse trees and the UNO semantic representation of the natural languag einput .
The grammar allows a limited context-sensitivity via features on lexical categories and non-terminals .Each grammar rule is supplied with the name of a function translating the recognized expressions of natura llanguage into the UNO representation .The Knowledge Representation module consists of the Boolean algebras module, Knowledg eBase Interpreter, and the Inference Engine module .
The Boolean algebras module implements th eUNO knowledge representation formalisms and some standard Boolean algebras such as predicate calculusand the powerset of a finite set .
The module contains functions for deriving the disjunctive normal form of acomplex Boolean expression independently of its algebra, as well as functions for creating the representatio nof the element that this complex Boolean expression stands for .The Knowledge Base Interpreter implements the interpreter of the sets of type equations encodingtaxonomic, temporal and geographical knowledge .The Inference Engine module implements the UNO algorithm for representing and utilizing knowledg ederived from natural language sentences.
This algorithm updates the dynamic knowledge bases of the UN Osystem .The Discourse module implements anaphora resolution, functions for identifying referring expression sand computing referents if needed, and discourse processing, functions for computing certain discours estructures that facilitate maintaining dynamic knowledge bases .The Learning module consists of functions mixing statistics and inductive learning techniques and i sused for corpus analysis and definite-anaphora-based knowledge acquisition .ControlFlexible, non-sequential control with all modules accessing the Knowledge Representation module .SpeedOur system is reasonably fast .
For MUG-6, it took slightly under half a minute to process a typical WS Jarticle in the development set .270WALKTHROUGH ARTICLE AND MORESomewhat Expected and Unexpected Problem sGiven our extremely ambitious goals for such a short period of time, and particularly knowledge engineerin glarge knowledge bases prevented us from doing coreference .
We fully expected that we will not be able tosuccessfully complete improving our existing anaphora resolution code and make it work reliably with th enewly created large knowledge bases .However, we did not expect a failure of the function printing out the markings .
This buggy piece of codeis about the easiest to fix, but at the same time, it is the most damaging in terms of the score .
We had t onot print the recognized organization names and turn off processing of the "HL" and "DATELINE" part sof the articles .Our Official, Unofficial, and Very Unofficial Scor eOur scores are not very meaningful because despite the fact that the problematic markings constituted onl ya small percentage of all the markings, 8% for the first six test articles, the scorer failed to score anything ,but four shortest articles ; this can be seen in the official results table below?
the "DD" slot containing a dat ein a canned "Month/Day/Year" format shows only four matches .In order to obtain an unofficial score, we had to edit our results, which we did strictly according to th etrace.
Even this unofficial score does not reflect well our real performance, only shows that we did something .For those things that we were able to mark, our own very unofficial estimate is that we performed in th ehigh nineties in both recall and precision (as can be seen in the enclosed sample article) .
For example, w ecorrectly marked both expressions problematic for most other systems : "the 21st century" and "Hollywood" .OFFICIA L?

It can all be gone like thee !</ p ></TXT ></DOC>Discussion of Result sFor each subtask, we show the D/T (developed/tested) ratio, the ratio of the number of articles used fo rdevelopment to the number of articles used for testing .
For errors, we show a brief explanation of the cause .NUMEXESD/T = 100/600 + many convoluted made up example sOur perfori.
)ance on numexes is very good?
it is not an extremely difficult task and we strove and achieveda near-completeness .
We correctly identified interesting cases :"C$7.4 million ""135 million Canadian dollar?"
$414, 1 67'" 87.5 cents"" 18 Canadian cent?
"three cent ?
"five to 10 cents"Occasionally the system makes an error .
For example, " though it is assumed that dozens of them won 'tbe", "Co ., to succeed Mark'', "60 pounds" are identified as money (the system knows pound, mark and wo nto be British, German and Korean monetary units, respectively ; the culprit is too local interpretation .
)TIMEXESD/T = 100/600275Our very good performance on the task of identifying temporal expressions was sligthly improved wit hhandling numbers .
Previously we were missing "bare" numeric years such as "the 1980 election" , " 1980s" ,"pre-1970' , and dates such as "4 .12" (as referring to "April 12-th" ) .Our errors included : " 57 years old" (probably misinterpreted task definition), "last year" (deliberatel ykept) and "three-and-a-half months" (only some dashes handled) .LOCATION SD/T = 100/600 (100/3000)Good performance on identifying locations stems from the combination of our rather complete critica lknowledge bases with the major named types and geographical information for all countries and automati cinterpretation of locative expressions with a known geographical type such as "the city of Farmington Hills"and " The Isle of Man" , and expressions of the form : "Smaller Region, Larger Region " such as "Poland, NewYork" .PERSONAL NAME SD/T = 100/600 (100/3000)Unsurprisingly good performance of our system in processing personal names stems from our fairl ycomplete knowledge bases with reasonable and not very strange first names along with the gender an dnicknames as aliases information .
Processing personal names is also supported by an extensive, 300-entr ydictionary of titles and professional degrees .
Some of our more interesting titles include :"Lieutenant Junior Grade" abbreviated as " Lt. jg" , "Knight Commander of the Order of the BritishEmpire" and "Your Serene Highness" .We correctly identified the following interesting cases :"Ms .
Washington" , " Mr. York" and "Ms. Lansing" were not confused with locations"John J. Dooner Jr' '"Steve" as first name reference"Kenneth H. Thorn" no title"Peter A .
Left" was not confused with the direction as in "go to the left'"Howard Dean" was not confused with the titleOur errors included :"Robert S .
"Steve " Miller" as two persons "Robert S . "
and "Steve Miller" (doublequotes basically ignored)"CFO Paul Rizzo" as a personal name (no real correction of misspels)"Thomas H. O'Brien Jr." (forgot about the singlequote in names, single letter cannot be a last name)"Dawn Capital" as a personal name (organization names suppressed )"Sun Chief Executive Scott McNealy" with "Sun" as TIMEX because abbreviates "Sunday" , "Chief' astitle because of a short cut, "Executive Scott McNealy" as a first-middle-last name tripl e(organization names Jot marked and interpretation too local )"does not consider himself a Butt-Head Astronomer" as a person with the "Head" title and the last nam e"Astronomer" (interpretation too local )SurprisesWe were surprised by two things .
First, that there is so much (depth to) abbreviations .
And second, thatpersonal pronouns do not obey expected distance constraints, contrary to the claims in the existing literatur ethat 96% of pronominal referents are no further than three sentences away .Greatest Limiting FactorsFor us, the greatest limiting factors were time, time, and time again .
We also found it very hard to create an ddebug large, circa 20,000 entry, typed knowledge bases .
Our knowledge acquisition and debugging technique sinvolved a combination of hand-crafting (geographical knowledge base), scanning (abbreviations), materia lthat others shared with us (for example, our department gave us an on-line, 800-or-so list of universities), an dsemi-automatic acquisition (our mentioned earlier newly developed technique based on definite anaphora) .276References[exp, 1996] (1996) .
