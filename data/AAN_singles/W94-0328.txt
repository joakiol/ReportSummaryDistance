As illustrated in several systems \[Hovy 88, Bateman & Paris 89,Paris 93\], the same core communication may be realised in numerous different ways, depending(among other factors) on the nature and relation of the interlocutors, the context of the commu-nication, the media employed, etc.
The combinatoric number of possibilities of all such factorsis extremely large.
Since most of them are not well understood at this time, automated textgeneration may appear to be a hopeless endeavour.Fortunately, the picture is not altogether bleak.
Given that certain types of communicativesituations consistently give rise to characteristic recognisable genres or text types, one canattempt o characterise each genre or text type in terms of the set of generator decisions orrules responsible for producing those characteristics, and then create prespecified, genre-specific,collections of features, formulated as decision rule criteria, for subsequent use (this point hasbeen made before, in \[Patten 88\] and \[Bateman & Paris 89\]).
With this aim in mind, two majorquestions arise:1.
Is there a regular categorisation f genres or text types?2.
How can one most easily determine the genre-determining features for given texts?In this paper we address both questions.
First we report on work developing a functionallymotivated framework to provide a matrix for the description, comparison, and classification of abody of texts.
This framework can act as the background for research on discourse phenomena,text planning, and realisation, and can enable groups working with different exts to relativisetheir results in terms of the matrix.
The approach involves a systematic search for correlationsbetween linguistic form and function in discourse, a discovery of the relation between meaningand wordings that accounts for the organization of linguistic features in each text type.
Thistask cannot be fully performed without linking the functions of particular linguistic featuresto variation in the communicative situation, since, as users and receivers of language, people?The first author was supported by ARPA Contrax:t MDA-904-91-C-5224.

June 21-24, 1994produce texts whose communicative function has to be interpreted in terms of the concretesituation in which they were produced.
The knowledge of the meaning potential associated witha generic situation is called register.Register has been the subject of much research in Linguistics \[Ferguson 83, Brown & Fraser 79,Hymes 74\],especially in Systemic-Functional Linguistics \[Halliday ~ Hasan 89, Ure 71, Gregory 88,Ghadessy 88, Caiferel 1991\], etc.
With.in SFL, various perspectives have been taken: I-Iallldayviews register from the lexicogrammatical perspective, while \[Martin 92\] sees it operating at thesemiotic level.
With a phenomenon as complicated as register, it is inevitable that conflictingpictures exist; however, in this paper we do not devote too much time to any specific view, butrather take a slightly more general approach to make our points relevant o all.
We view reg-isters simply as stable configurations of features at all levels u semiotic, grammatical, lexical,phonological m linked together.
In the first part of the paper, then, we outline several high-leveland somewhat more general than usually provided register networks, drawn from a variety ofsources and organized according to communicative metafunction.With regard to the second half of the paper, we describe a semi-automatic method to deter-mine genre-defining features for a given text, and show how the degree of genre-specificity can bemeasured quantitatively.
This follows on register-oriented work in computational research on lan-guage generation, in particular that of \[Patten 88, Bateman & Paris 89, Bateman ~ Paris 91\].Our work in some ways follows upon that of Bateman and Paris, who outline an ambitious5-step met-hod for the definition of register and the control of a generator program, using threevariations of a sentence as illustration: 1. text analysis; 2. classification of features according touser; 3. classification of features with respect o register type; 4. creation of register networks;and 5. specification of generator control.
We take a less ambitious and somewhat different ap-proach to some of the same issues (steps 1, 3, and 4), and develop a semi-automated featurecollection technique using as illustration 10 clauses from the instruction stage of a recipe.
Thecontribution of this paper is twofold:1. somewhat more high-level and comprehensive register networks, drawn from several sourcesand organized according to communicative metafunction (in contrast o steps 3 and 4);2. a semi-automated abductive method for identifying rammatical features that are register-defining (in contrast o step 1).2 The  components  of the  communicat ive  s i tuat ionAccording to Halliday, language performs threeprincipal functions imultaneously: the ideationalfunction (to understand the interlocutors' physical, mental, and emotional environment), he in-terpersonal.function (to act on other people in it); and the teztual .function (to employ the mediaand situation at hand for optimal communication) \[Halliday 85\].
In a each instantiated com-munication, the speaker performs a series of linguistic choices from these three metafunctionsof language: in Systemic terms, he or she selects features from language-based system networksassigned to the three different functions.The communicative situation - -  topic, interlocutors, context, etc.
- -  is closely correlatedwith and helps determine the configuration of meanings elected from these three functionalcomponents of language.
Given this correlation, each particular communicative situation ispartitioned into three regions corresponding to the linguistic ones: the experiential meaningsof the text reflect the FIELD, the interpersonal meanings reflect the TENOR, and the textual2307th International Generation Workshop * Kennebunkport, Maine * June 21-24, 1994Fleld(Ideation~functionE.xpeu'iemialDom'~nlS~MOLOGY ~ r-.EAqCOCP, AMM.AR ~ PHONVGRAPH.-...---process type "~,  Transitivittyparticipmar..5circumstantial rol~ "~Adjuutivization~ime ",~ Teasepcrspectiv?

We can say that field, tenor, and mode are theactual selections (from the ideational, the interpersonal, and the textual components of thelanguage code respectively) taken in a particular event surrounding and including the languageact.In the remainder of this section we briefly describe the three aspects of communication.
Moredetails are provided in the longer version of this paper, available from the authors.The  field O f d iscourse .
According to Halllday, the field of discourse refers to "what ishappening, to the nature of the social action that is taking place: what is it that the participantsare engaged in, in which the language figures as an essential component" \[Halliday & Hasan 89\].The field of discourse can also be called the text's experiential domain which includes the text'ssubject matter,  that is, its ideational or propositional content.
The network in Figure 1 illustratesthese aspects.The  tenor  o f  d iscourse .
Where field predicts the range of meaning potentials in the expe-riential component of the language code, the tenor of discourse predicts the selection of optionsin the interpersonal component.
According to Haniday and Hasan, "the tenor of discourse refersto who is taking part, to the nature of the participants, their statuses and roles: what kinds ofrole relationships obtain aanong the part ic ipants.
.
.
,  both the types of SPEECH ROLE that theyare taking on in the dialogue and the whole cluster of socially significant relationships in whichthey are involvdd" (\[Halliday & Ha.san 89\], p. 27).
The tenor of discourse involves the selectionof a number of options in the subsystems that configure the participants' peech roles.
Amongthese speech roles we distinguish two principal types: one set of systems is concerned with theNEGOTIATION OF SPEECH ROLES, the other is concerned with the SPEECH MODALITIES.
Figure 2contains ome of these options in a systemic network.The  mode o f  d iscourse .
The mode of discourse has traxtitionally been seen as composedof selections from three simultaneous parameters: the LANGUAGE ROLE, the MEDIUM, and theCHANNEL OF DISCOURSE.
The LANGUAGE ROLE is a continuum with the two ends of the scalebeing whether the language is constitutive or ancillary (the language in a face-to-face serviceencounter being ancillary since it accompanies an activity and is not the sole meaningful activity,and the language of a physics research paper being constitutive since the text creates the entireexchange).
ThelMEDIUM OF DISCOURSE deals with the process of text creation, with the degreeof sharing the process of text creation between the interlocutors.
The CHANNEL OF DISCOURSEis the modality through which the language is received, including typically the options GRAPHICand PHONIC.
Early work on register (e.g., \[Gregory & Carroll 78\]) often glossed medium asbeing congruent with the option between speaking and writing, but we can now go further231TENOR(Int~:apex,so~f~etio.

This is also necessarygiven the range of substantial empirical work (e.g., \[Redeker 84, Biber 89\] and others) showingthat the spoken/written distinction per  se is not a simple parameter.
The lexicogrammaticalconsequences of the features hown in Figure 3 are discussed in \[Martin 92\].3 Using the multidimensional analysis of texts for generationAs discussed in \[Matthiessen 94\], register can be interpreted (and therefore implemented in asentence generator) in three ways:?
Probability variations of choices within systems: Each register imposes its idiosyncraticprobability distribution upon the choice preferences within appropriate systems, so thatwhile the grammar remains the same throughout, the generator's traversal of the grammarwill vary according to registerial probabilities;?
Core system with extensions for variation: Each register adds some idiosyncratic systemsat appropriate points of the grammar while leaving the remainder unchanged;?
Completely separated system networks: Each register has a distinct subgrammar, and nocommon core exists.
This is the approach taken in \[Patten 88, Bateman  Paris 91\].
Inthis sense, register-specific language is treated like a sublanguage \[Kittredge ~ Lehrberger 81\].2327th International Generation Workshop ?
Kennebunkport, Maine ?
June 21-24, 1994We follow the first approach.
In this section, we outline a method of semi-automaticallydetermining probability distributions for each register, taking as example the instruction stageof a recipe:Remove fruit and 2tbs of juice from the can, then discard the rest.
Put all ingredientsinto a saucepan and slowl~t bring to the boil.
When hot, pour into a food processorand process to a smooth sauce.
For eztra texture reserve 1-2 pieces of fruit, mash,then add this to the finished sauce.
(SHE Magazine, June 1993)What are the lexicogrammatical features that express the features of field, tenor, and mode?For fully worked out systems, tracing them through the labyrinthine networks is tedious at best.For partially worked out systems, the connections between the higher level networks uch asfield and the lower level networks of the grammar often do not exist, and so another method isrequired for determining the registerially determinating features at the lower levels.One such method, suggested in \[Bateman & Paris 91\], is to perform grammatical (and pre-sumably lexical) analyses of sample texts by hand.
While (as they nicely illustrate) this ispossible for small samples, the problem of ensuring coverage and consistency for larger samplescan quickly become daunting.
For this reason, we propose a "bottom-up" abductive method,using the generator as a tool, that is considerably easier, since it is semi-automatic.
The methodinvolves the fonowing steps:1.
For each sentence in the sample text type under consideration, create an input specificationfor the generator.2.
Run the generator on each input specification and check that the output sentences arecorrect.
Collect the lexicogrammatical features for each sentence.3.
Classify the features for each sentence according to register type (field, tenor, or mode)and constituent type (clause complex, clause, noun phrase, lexical, etc.).4.
Count the number of times each feature appears in the whole test sample as a percentageof the number of times its constituent type appeared.
For example, if the NP featureDETERMINED appears 9 times for 10 noun phrases in a sample, then we say the involvementof this feature is 90%.
Graph or tabulate the distribution of feature involvement as numberof features vs. percentile.5.
Through inspection of the resulting table, determine the register-determinate cutoff pointthe point after which features appear too seldom to be indicative of the text type.
Thispoint will appear at the 'knee' at which the curve begins to rise rapidly for small increasesof involvement.We use the sentence generator Penman to generate the sentences in the sample text we se-lected, and collected the features it needed.
The total number of features (including duplication)came to 543.
Of these, 48 features appeared every time they could (i.e., were present every timea syntactic onstituent of the appropriate type was generated: 10 at the clause complex level,19 at the clause level, and 19 at the NP level).
That is, 48 features had an involvement of 100%.We then graphed out the distribution of feature involvements.
Notwithstanding the small sam-ple size, we found a striking regularity: the involvement distribution was bimodal, with somefeatures appearing very often (over 80%) and almost all the remainder appearing infrequently(under 30%, for the clause and NP levels, and under 60% for the clause complex level).
That is,2337th International Generation Workshop - Kennebunkport, Maine * June 21-24, 1994the middle range between 80% and 30% involvement contained significantly fewer features thaneither of the extremes.
This we interpret as follows: when features appear often, they appearvery often, and thus specify the genre characteristics.
On the other hand, if features do notappear often, they appear seldom, only as needed to produce the particular clause(s) in whichthey appear.
The degree to which features with high involvements appear can be thought of asthe degree to which they co-specify the genre, and thus the "strength" of their propensity forselection during the text and sentence planning processes.The following tables summarize (full information appears in the long version of this paper).C lause-complex level Clause level !

An important advantage is that it focuses human effort not on text analysis (which isdifficult and prone to error and inconsistency) but rather on generator input creation (which caneasily be checked).
Also, the graphed istribution of feature involvements provides an immediatevisual clue as to which features are indeed register-determinate andto what degree they are so.
Inturn, this allows the register-grammarian to express grammar decision rules (or system networkoptions, in the case of SFL) in terms of probabilities with some empirical confidence.
Anotherbenefit is that the method assists with text type characterisation, by pointing out (throughdramatically lower involvement values) when different ext types or stages are mixed.2347th International Generation Workshop * Kennebunkport, Maine ?
