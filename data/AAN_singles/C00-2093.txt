ukAbst ractA method is de.scribed by which a rhetorical-structure tree can be realized by a text structuremade up of sections, paragraphs, sentences, verti-cal lists, mid other textual patterns, with discourseconnectives added (in the correct positions) to markrhetorical relations.
We show that text-structuringcan be formulated as a Constraint Satisfaction Prob-lem, so that all solutions rest)ecting constraints ontext-structure formation and structu,'al compatibil-ity can be efficiently generated.
Of the many sohl-tions generated by this method, some are stylisti-cally preferable to others; we show how further con-straints can be applied in order to select the bestversions.
Finally, we discuss some extensions uchas the generation of indented text structures.1 In t roduct ionMuch recent work on language generation (I-tosnerand Stede, 1992; Hovy, 1993; Mellish et al, 1998)has made use of discourse representations basedon Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann andThompson, 1988).
Interest has focussed in particu-lar on the problem of buihting a rhetorical str'uct~tre(RS) which organizes elementary propositions him'-archically by means of RST relations (.NIarcu, 1996).There has been less attention to a second problemin text plmming, that of realizing the RS by a te:rtstruct.uT'e (TS), in which the material in the RS is dis-tributed among I)aragraphs, entences, vertical ists,etc., perhaps linked up by discourse connectives suchas 'since' and 'however'.
This task, which we willcall text structuring, is typically addressed througha micro-planning phase that determines the contentof successive sentences.
However, docmnents of re-alistic complexity require richer TSs including, forexample, vertical ists, sub-sections, and clauses ep-arated by semi-colons.We describe in this pat)or a text-structuring sys-tem that has been developed within ICONOCLAST 1 , aproject which investigates applications of constraint-based reasoning in Natural Language GeneratiouI ICONOCI.AST is supt)orted by the UI<.

Following Scott and de Souza(1990), we represent rhetorical structure by graphslike figure 1, in which non-ternfinal nodes rel)re-sent RST relations, terminal nodes represent propo-sitions, and linear order is unspecified (for regularity,the nucleus is arbitrarily presented on the left of thesatellite).
One of many possible TSs realizing thisI{S is shown in figure 2, au ordered tree in whichnodes are labelled with %ext-categories' (Nunberg,1990); the terminal nodes hold either discourse con-nectives (which owing to their interaction with textstructure have already been selected) or l)ropositions(to be realized in their turn during tactical genera-tion).
After passing this TS to the tactical genera-tor, we might obtain the.
following OUtlmt2:The FDA bans Elixir since it contains gesto.-dene; however, the FDA approves ElixirPlus.Part of the interest of the prol)lem is that RS andTS are not always isomorphic; this will be illustratedlater by an alternative TS realizing figure 1 (figure6b).Our goal in ICONOCLAST has  been to explore thehuge variety of ways in which an RS can be con-veyed, noting stylistic reasons why one version mightbe preferred to another, with the eventual aim ofproviding a system in which the user enjoys fine-grained control over style as well as content.

By a 'candi( late'  we mean a solu-tion that  correct ly realizes the RS without violat ingtext -st ructure format ion rules; it may neverthelessbe styl ist ical ly inel)t. Having generated a set of can-d idate text; structures,  the ICONO(ILAST system eval-uates them through rules that detect styl ist ic tlaws,and on this basis re:ranges them in an order of prefer-en(:e. We will discuss styl istic evaluation brMly, butthe focus of the paper  is the 1)roblem of enum(;ratingsolutions.2 Format ion  rulesA text structur( '  is defined in ICONOCI,AST as all or-dered tree ill which each node has a text-t 'ategory('O:ml)rising two t~atur(,s named TI,;X'I'-I,I,;VEI, and IN-I)ENTATION.

Fol lowing Nunberg (1990), : text-sentenee'denotes a unit normal ly  Imnetuated with a capitalletter and a flfll stop; this is dist inguished froin thesyntact ic concept of 'senten('e', which depends onsyntact ic format ion rules.
Thus the following para-graph consists of three text-sentences which contain,respectively, one, zero, and two syntact ic  sentences:He entered the room.

The safe wasol)en and the money had gone.A (;ext-clause is a unit that  would nornmlly be Imne-tuated with a semicolon; the text-sentence you arenow reading contains two text-clauses, but  tile see-end semicolon does not appear  because it has been'absorbed'  into the flfl l-stop that  marks the wholetext-sentence.
Wil;hin a text-clause, hierarchy is de-termined by syntax rather  than text-structm'e,  so allunits within a text-c lause are assigned the minimalTI~XT-LF, VEI~ of  zero.The tmrt)ose of INDENTATION is to allow indentedtext structures like lmlteted lists; the feature takesvalues in the range 0, 1, 2 .

a list i tem within a list i tem has 1NI)ENTA-TION ---~ 2and so forth.
To siml)lit~y the presentat ion,  we willassume for now that  all nodes have INI)ENTAT1ON =0, so that  text-categories are dist inguished only byTI~XT-I,EVEI,.intormally,  a text structure is well-formed if it re-sl)ects the hierarchy of textual  evels, so that  sectionsare coml/osed of paragraphs,  i )aragraphs of text-sentences ,  atl(l so forth.
An examt)le of all i l l -formedstru(:ture would be one in which a text-sentence, con-tained a paragrat)h; such a structure can occur onlywhen the.
paragrat)h is indented - - a possibi l i ty weare excluding here.
Formally, the text -structure tbr-mat ion rules are as follows:1.
A text structure is an ordered tree in whicheach node i has a TEX'F-LENq~,I, Li iIl the rangeO..LMox.2.
If a node p has a ( laughter node d, then p musthave  a 'I'EXT-IA,;Xfl.
;L Olle ral lk higher than d, un-less t)oth no(les have the minimal  level 0.
Inother words, either(a) L v=L , ;+ l ,o r(b) L v = Ld = 0(From this it follows that  any nodes that  aresisters must have the stone level.)3.
All terminal  nodes must have tilt: minimalTIqXT-LEVEI, o f  0.In most al)l)l ications it would also inake sense to seta lower l imit on the root node.
For instance, wemight at)I)ly the constraint  L,?.oot _> 2 to ensure thatthe whole text is at least a text-sentence.3 Compat ib i l i tyAs well as being a welM'ormed text  structure,  a can-d idate solution must realize a rhetorical  structure'correct ly ' ,  in a sense that  we need to mak(: precise.Roughly, a correct solution should satist~y three coil-ditions:6431.
The terminal nodes of the TS should expressall tim elementary propositions in tile RS; theymay also contain discourse connectives express-ing rhetorical relations in tile RS, although forsome relations discourse commctives are op-tional.2.
The TS must respect rules of syntax when itcombines propositions and discourse connec-tives within a text-clause; tbr instance, a con-junction such as 'but'  linking two text-phrasesmust be coordinated with tile second one.3.
Tile TS must be structurally compatible withthe RS.The first two conditions are straightforward, butwhat is meant by 'structural compatibil ity'?
Wesuggest the crucial criterion should be as follows:any grouping of the elementary propositionsin the  TS must also occur in the RS.
In otherwords, the text-strncturer is allowed to eliminategroupings, but not to add any.
More formally:?
If a node in tile TS dominates terminal nodesexpressing a set of elementary propositions,there nmst be a corresponding node in the RSdominating the same set of propositions.?
Tile converse does not hold: for instance, an RSof the form R1(R2(pi,p2),p3) can be realizedby a paragraph of three sentences, one for eachproposition, even though this TS contains nonode dominatillg the propositions (Pl and P2)that are grouped by R2.
However, when thishappens, the propositions grouped togettmr inthe I7(S nmst remain consecutive in the TS; so-lutions in which Pa comes inbetween Pl and P2are protfibited.4 Generat ing  so lu t ionsOur procedure for generating candidate solutions isbased on a technique for formulating text structuringas a constTvdnt satisfaction pTvblem (CSP) (Henten-ryck, 1989).
In general, a CSP is characterized bytim following elements:?
A set of variables V1..I/'N.?
For each variable l/i, a finite domain Di of pos-sible values.?
A set of constraints on the wflues of the vari-ables.
(For integer domains these often use'greater than' and 'less than'; other domainsusually rely on 'equal' or 'unequal'.
)A solution assigns to each variable 17/ a value fl'omits domain Di while respecting all constraints.
De-pending on tile constraints, there may be multiplesolutions, or there may be no solution at all.The difficulty in formulating a configuration taskas a CSP is that we usually do not know in ad-vance how many variables the solution will contain.Problems of this kind are sometimes called dynamic(Deehter and Dechter, 1988), because the set of rel-evant variables changes as the search for a solutionprogresses.
The solution in figure 2, for examl)le,has nine TS nodes, each bearing a TEXT-LEVEL vari-able; different realizations of the same RS mighthave more nodes, or fewer.
However, we have foundthat all candidate solutions can be generated by as-signing four variables (TEXT-LEVEL, INI)ENTATION~ORDER and CONNECTIVE)  to  each node of rhetori-cal structure, so obtaining a partial description thatdetermines a unique TS.
Intuitively, the idea is thatthis description should specify a subset of the nodesin the target TS; further nodes are then added, by adeterministic procedure, in order to satisfy the for-nlation rules and accommodate any discourse con--nectives.causeban(fda, elixir) contain(elixir, gestodene)(b)TEXT-LEVI~L = {0..4}ORDER = {t,2}causeTEXT-LEVEL = 3ban(fda, elixir) contain(elixir, gestodene)TEXT-LEVEL = {0..4\]ORDER = { 1,2 }Figure 3: Adding solution variablesAs an introduction to this nmthod, we will beginby working through a very simple example.
Supposethat our aim is to find all TSs that realize the I{Sin figure 3a in a paragraph, without using discourseconnectives or indentation.Create solution variablesThe first step is to add TEXT-LEVEL and Oa-DER variables to each RS node.
Since ORDERrepresents tile linear position of a text span inrelation to its sisters, it can be omitted fi-om theroot .Assign domainsEach variable is assigned a finite domain of pos-sine values (figure 3b).
For TEXT-LEVEI.
vari-ables, tile donlain is O..LMax; for ORI)Ell vari-ables it is 1..N, where N is the number of sis-ters.
Since we have decided that the whole text644should be a paragrat)h, we can fix the TEXT-I,I.~VEL Oll the root directly (assigning it thewflue 3).Apply const ra in tsConstraints over the solution variables are nowapplied.
Informally, these are as follows: theroot node should have a higher TEXT-LF.VEI.than its daughters; sister nodes should have thesame vahms for TEXT-LIgVEL but  different val-ues {-'or ORDER; and since the 'cause' relation isnot marked by a discourse connective, its argu-ments (the two prot)ositions) cannot be realizedby text-t)hrases (the result would be syntacti-cally ill-formed) --- in otlmr words, they musthave TI~XT-LEVEL ?
0.
Collectively, these con-straints reduce the TEXT-LEVEL domains for timterminal nodes to {1,2}.Enumerate  so lut ionsThe solutions can IIOW be enmnerated by com-puting all combinations of values that respecttile constraints.
One example of a solution isshown ill figure 4a.Compute  eomplete  text  s t ruc turesFor each solution, a complete TS can tie corn-tinted by adding any nodes that are required bythe text-structure formation rules (figure 4b).causeTEXT-LEVEL = 3(a) NUCL " /~S S~'ELL ITE/ \ban(fda, elixir) contain(elixir, gestodene)TEXT-LEVEL = 1 TEXT-LEVEI~ = 1ORI)ER = 2 ORDI{R = Iparagraph (3)sentence (2)text-clause (1) text-clause (1)text-phrase (0) text-phrase (0)contain(elixir, gestodene) ban(fda, elixir)Figure 4: Completing a solutionIn this simple case there are just four solutions,since tile TEXT-LEVI.3I, and ORI)EI/.

Here are texts that mightresult from the four solutions (L and O represent'FEXT-LI,3VEL and ORDER; N and S represent nucleusand satellite):LN = 1, ON = 1, Ls  = 1, Os = 2Elixir is banned by the FDA; it contains gesto-(lelle.LN = 1, ON = 2, Ls = 1, Os = 1 (figure 4)Elixir contains gestodene; it is banned by theFDA.LN = 2, ON = 1, Ls  = 2, Os  = 2Elixir is banned by tile FDA.
It contains gesto-(telle.LN =2,  ON = 2, Ls  = 2 ,0s  = lElixir contains gestodene.
It is banned by theFDA.The method for including discourse connectiveshas been described elsewhere (Power et al, 1999).Briefly, the lexical entry for a discourse connectivemust specify its syntactic category (at present wecover subordinating conjunctions, coordinating con-junctions and conjuuctivc adverbs) and whether it isrealized Oil the nucleus or the satellite.
For example,the relation cause can be marked by the subordinat-ing conjunction 'since' (realized on tim satellite) orthe coi\imlctive adverb 'consequently' (realized onthe nucleus) - -  among others.
The choice of dis-course connective strongly coustrains tile values ofq'EXT-I~EVEL gi ld ORDI,~,R for tile arguments of tilerelation.
If cause is expressed by 'since', the argu-merits may occur in any order, but they must betext-ptlrases:Since Elixir contains gestodene, it is bannedby the FDA.Elixir is 1)armed by the FDA since it containsgestodene.#Elixir is banne.d by the FDA; since it con-tains gestodene.#Elixir is banned by the FI)A.
Since i~ con-tains gestodene.If instead cause is expressed by :cousequently', thesatellite nulst be placed before tile nucleus, and uu-less tim style is very informal tile arguments houldhave TEXT-I,I~VEI, values above texl;-t)hrase:Elixir contains gestodene; consequently, it isbrained by the FDA.Elixir is banned by the FDA.
Consequently, itcontains gestodene.~Elixir is banned by the FDA, consequentlyit contains gestodene.5 Const ra in tsWe now state the text-structuring constraints pre-cisely, including the feature CONNECTIVE but stillonlitting INI)ENTATION.
Before applying ttlese con-straints, finite domains are assigned to each tlS nodei:TEXT-LEVEl, L i  ----- {0..LMa:~}OI{1)EI{ 0 i ~- {I...N} (for N sisters)645COllCeSsionTEXT-LEVE I~ = 4CONNECTIVE  = { 0, al lhough, however}J \approve( i l ia ,  e l ix i rqf lus)  causeTI~XT- I~EVEL = {0..4} TEXT-LEVEL  = {0..4}ORDER = {1,2} ORDER = {1,2}CONNECTIVE  = 0 CONNECTIVE  = {0, since, consequent ly  }NUCL)~J  ~ELL ITE/ \ban(fda,  el ixir)  contain(el ix ir ,  gestodene)TEXT-LEVEL  = {0..4} TEXT-LEVEL  = {O..4}ORDER = {1,2} ORDER = {1,2}CONNECTIVE  = 0 CONNECTIVE  = 0Figure 5: Domain assigmnentsCONNECTIVE Oil the node cause (figure 3a) Ci ={~, since, consequently}; on a proposition ode,Ci = 0.
The value ~1 represents the option ofusing no discourse connective.As an example, possible domain assigmnents for fig-ure 1 are shown in figure 5.
The constraints are asfollows:Root DominationThe TEXT-LEVEL of the root node r must exceedthat of any daughter d.L v > LdParental DominationTile TEXT-LEVEl, of" a parent node p Inust beequal to or greater than tile TIgXT-I,EVEL of anydaughter d.Lp >_ LdSister  Equa l i tyIf nodes a and b are descended from the sameparent, they must have the same TEXT-LEVEL.La =- LbSister  OrderIf nodes a and b are descended fi'om the sameparent, they must have different values of OR-DER.O~ ?

If a parent is more than one level above itsdaughters (Lp - Ld > 1), extra nodes are addedbeneath tim parent to bridge tile gap - -  hencethe paragraph node in figure 6b.?
If a parent has the same level as its daughters(Lp = Ld), the daughters are raised to replacetim t)arent.
Thus in figure 6b, the paragraphhas three sentences, and a rhetorical groupinghas been left unrealized iu the TS.
Of course thereader might infer the intended RS from otherevidence (e.g.
semantic plausibility).?
If a terminal node i has a level above text-phrase(Li > 0), a chain of nodes is added to bring it'down to earth' (e.g.
the chain below the firsttext-sentence in figure 6b).646?
Discourse connectives are t)assed down to thetext>clause ill which they should be realized.This is decide(l (i) by l)assing the connective tothe aI)l)ropriate argument (nucleus or satellite),according to its lexical entry, and (it) by there-after 1)assing it; down to tile first constituent ifthe argument is complex (Power et al, 1999).After tactical generation, we might obtain tile fol-lowing (rather poor) result:Elixir contains gestodene.
Consequently, it; isbanned by the FDA.
Itowever, the FDA ap-proves ElixirPhls.7 StyleHaving designed a procedure tha.t will generate alltext structures meeting mininml standards of co lrectness, we need to at)l)ly fllrther constraints ill or-der to eliminate solutions that are stylistically eccen-tric or at least ill-suited to the l)Url)ose at hand.In ICONOCI,AS'I', this call be done in two ways:?
If a stylistic (lefect is regarded as fatal, it isexchlded 1)y a hard constraint on the sohltionvariables, so that TSs with tiffs defect are nevergenerated.?
If a stylistic defect is regar(ted as non-fatal (i.e.unwelcome trot sometimes necessary), it is 1)e-nalize(1, by a sot;(; constraint, during a subse-quent evaluation t)hase iil which the enunmratedsolutions m'e ordered from best to worst.The user can iml)ose stylistic 1)retL'r(',n(:es by switch-ing hard constraints on/off, and also by weiglltingsoft constraints (i.e.

Wehot)e to gradually extend this frmnework to covermany phenonmna that are currently excluded:?
Since its inlmt takes the form of a rhetoricalstructure tree, the text; strueturer inherits allylimitations of RST as a description of rhetoricalorganization.?
We cover only three types of discourse commc-tive (subordillating conjmmtion, coordinatingconjunction, conjuctive adverb).?
At present here is no treatment of titles.?
There is no treatment of relative clauses, which(:all be elnt)loyed for exami)le to realize thee laborat ion  relation (Scott; and de Souza,1990):Zovirax, which contains the antiviralagent aciclovir, is a smooth white cretan.?
There is no treatinent of propositions that areexpressed parenthetically.Zovirax, since it; is for you only, shouldnever be given to other l)atients.Zovirax should never be given to otherpall(mrs (the medicine is for you only).?
We have omitted the colou-expansion pat-tern (Nunl)erg, 1.990) and some other featuresinthleneing i)unctuation (emi)hasis , quotationmarks, parentheses).?
We have not covered the integration of text withtloating items like diagrams, tal)les, or boxes.Two extensions that have already been iml)lementedare indentation and centering.
We have exl)lainedhere how indentation is represented in text struc-ture; the relevant constraints will be described else-where.
Centering has been incorporated by assign-ing backward and forward centers to all 1)rot)ositionsill a comt)leted TS bcforc generating the wording;in this way, centering transitions can be evahlatedbefore tactical generation begins, and TSs yieldinggood c(mtimlity of reference can be i)referred (Kibbleaud Power, 1999).To use our approach ill 1)ractical applications, onemust address the 1)roblem that the number of eandi-(late solutions increases exi)onentially with the con>plexity of the rhetorical structure --- measured, forexanll)le , by the mmfl)er of elementary propositions.lil informal trials we find that the numl)er of solu-tions is roughly 5 g -1  for all input with N proposi-tions; this means that even for a short passage con-taining n dozen propositions, the text t)lanner wouldlind about 50 million solutions satisfying the hard647constraints.
For texts of non-trivial ength, theresteins no alternative to sacrificing lobal ot)timalityin the interests of efficiency.
One option is to usea statistical optimization method such as a geneticalgorithm (Mellish et al, 1998).
In ICONOCLAST wehave preferred a method of partial optimization iwhich the the text-structuring problem is split intoparts, so that at each stage only a manageable partof the total solution is constructed.
For instance,when planning a patient information leaflet, the se-mantic material could first be distributed among sec-tions, then perhaps among t)aragraphs, thus spawn-ing many small-scale text-structuring problems forwhich the search spaces would be measured in hun-dreds rather than billions.ReferencesA.
