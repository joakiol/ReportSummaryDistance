Box 1020, Los Alamos, NM 87544-1020Principal Investigator: Dr. George Zweig; (505) 662-6855, zweig@earwig.lanl.govObjectives: The objective of this project is to develop a preprocessor for speechrecognition systems operating in noisy environments.
The preprocessor, consistingof a nonlinear inhomogeneous transmission line, will be realized in software,although realization in hardware in FYgl should be possible.
More specifically wewill:1) Develop a nonlinear transmission line preprocessor that accurately simulates themechanics of the mammalian inner ear at all sound pressure levels.2) Preprocess peech with the nonlinear transmission line and show that there is asubstantial improvement in the signal to noise ratio.3) Assess the desirability and feasibility of implimenting either a digital or analogtransmission line on a chip and using it as a preprocessor in the CMU, BBN, orMIT DARPA funded speech recognition systems.Recent accomplishments."
A speech preprocessor based on a nonlinear transmissionline model of the cochlea 1 was proposed.
2 Sounds of different intensities, such asvoiced and unvoiced speech, are analyzed in radically different ways.
The Q's ofthe preprocessor's nonlinear filters vary withinput amplitude, higher Q's (longerintegration times) corresponding to quieter sounds.
In addition, for quiet sounds,the preprocessor acts like a laser that traps and amplifies low level signals, therebyaiding in their detection and analysis.Work planed/or FYgO: Analytical and numerical methods for solving the non-linear transmission line equations will be developed.References1.
