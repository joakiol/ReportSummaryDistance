The PLUS AcceleratorRoberto Bisiani, Principal InvestigatorSchool of Computer ScienceCarnegie Mellon UniversityPittsburgh, PA 15213Our plan is to demonstrate a workstation accelerator(called PLUS) that not only executes the current speechrecognition systems in real time, but that will also supportthe increasing computational demands of speech recog-nition systems in the next several years.
The acceleratorwill also be useful for other compute-bound applications.The accelerator will be replicated and made available toother sites.Our approach is to connect single-processor machines ofroughly the performance of high-end workstations bymeans of a very fast and powerful communicationmechanism.
This makes the memory on each node visibleto every other node as if the system were a single shared-memory multiprocessor.
The prototype, for example, uses25MHz Motorola 88000 processors with up to 32 Mbytesof DRAM memory and 512 Kbytes of SRAM in eachnode; the interconnection is based on a MOSIS-built meshrouter with 40Mbytes/sec bandwidth.PLUS research contribution comprises new mechanismsto support shared-memory and synchronization betweenprocessors.
The emphasis i  on low latency and low over-head synchronization.The PLUS prototype is interfaced to host computer sys-tems by means of a SCSI interface, this interface can alsoperform speech input/output and limited signal processing.Interfacing PLUS to a host does not require any operatingsystem change on the host.We have completed the design of both the PLUS boardand of the host interface.
After fabrication i s completed weexpect o take about two months for debugging and thenstart replication.
Minimal software (sufficient, for example,for running the Sphinx system) is already available.Motivation and description of the PLUS architecture canbe found in:Bisiani, R. and Ravishankar, M.Programming the PLUS Distributed-Memory S stemFifth Distributed Memory Computing ConferenceCharleston, SC, April 1990Bisiani, R. and Ravishankar, M.PLUS: A Distributed Shared Memory System17th Annual International Symposium onComputer ArchitectureSeattle, WA, May 1990This project is co-sponsored by Apple Computer, Inc.412
