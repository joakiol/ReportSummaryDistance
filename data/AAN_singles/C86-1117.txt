Getting Things Out Of Order(Au LFG-Proposal for the Treatment of German Word Order)Klaus NetterDepartment of LinguisticsUniversity of StuttgartWest Germany0.
INTRODUCTION 1)One of the most characteristic features of German word orderseems to be a contrast between fixed ordering rules concerningthe order of verbal elements and a much more variable orderingof their corresponding nominal arguments.
As a consequenceGerman word order seems to yield a large number of phenomena thatmay be classified as 'unbounded' or 'long-distance dependencies',without necessarily involving wh-constituents or 'movement'across sentence boundaries.
Whereas in traditional LFG long dis-tance dependencies are treated by means of constituent control,we will follow a recent proposal by KAPLAN and ZAENEN (1986)to give up the constraint known as 'functional locality' andinstead allow regular expressions to appear as functional schemataannotated to c-structure rules.
Exploiting the principles ofcompleteness and coherence we will thus be able to cope even withabsolutely free word order without the need of generating emptyterminal nodes at all.
The empirical assumption, underlying theproposed analysis in its most radical form, is the hypothesis that(with very few exceptions) the nominal arguments have to appear tothe left of the verb by which they are assigned case.
We willrestrict the discussion to sentences with one finite verb as wellas to subcategorized nominal arguments, largely ignoringADJuncts.
2)In chap.
1. we will introduce the mechanism of 'functionalincertainty', applied to the example of extraposed infinitivalconstructions.
Chap.
2. will deal with the sentence initial posit-ion(s) in verb-second clauses and chap.
3. will discuss someapproaches to handle free word order in the topological fieldbetween COMP and the clause-final verb complex.1.
EXTRAPOSED INFINITIVAL CONSTRUCTIONSTo demonstrate the mechanism of 'functional iucertainty' aswell as some basic assumption in the proposed fragment ofGerman grammar we will start with a relatively simple probleminvolving the treatment of embedded and extraposed infinitivalconstructions.
Consider the following data: 3)(1) dass \[der Mann \[\[ das Such gelesen \] haben\] wird\].that the man the book read have wit l(2) dass \[der Mann \[\[das Such zu lesen\] versucht\] hat\].that the man the book to read t r ied  has(3) dass \[der Mann \[\[das Such gelesen\] zu haben\] scheint\].that the man the book read to have seems(4) dass \[der Mann \[versucht\] hat\], \[das Buch zu lesen\].that the man t r ied  has , the book to read(5) *dass\[der Mann scheint\],\[\[ das Such gelesen\] zu haben\].that the man seems , the book read ta have(6) *dass \[der Mann wird\], \[\[das Such gelesen\] haben\].that the man wit t ,  the book read have(7) dass \[der Mann \[ versucht\] hat\], \[zu behaupten\],\[\[das Such gelesen\] zu haben\]that the man tried has, to ctairn, the book read to haveSentence (1) contains a main verb and two auxiliary verbs, (2),(4) and (6) contain equi verbs (versuchen, behaupten), 'scheinen'in (3) and (5) represents a raising verb.
(2) is the same struct-ure as (4) with the infinitival clause extraposed in the latter.The contrast between (2)/(4) and (3)/(5) or (1)/(6) illustratestwo points: on the one hand extrapositiou is permitted iff thegoverning verb governs the 'zu' infinitive and is not a raisingverb; on the other hand even with these conditions metextraposition is not obligatory.
Informally extraposition can thusbe characterised as an optional right-adjunction of an embeddedconstituent o a self-embedding structure.
Sentence (7) is toshow that this rule can be applied recursively.494In the treatment of equi- and raising-verbs, including (in out"approach) auxiliary and any kind of modal verbs, we willfollow the traditional LFG approach; these verbs are sub-categorized for the 'open' grammatical function XCOMP and are cor-respondingly assigned a functional control equation that identifiesthe verb's own subject or object with the subject of thisXCOMP.
Raising verbs are distinguished from equi verbs by denotingthat the 'raised' function will not be interpreted in the raisingverb's semantic form.
Beyond this it will have to be specified foreach equi or raising verb what type of infinitive the verbal headof the governed XCOMP has to be (The feature referring toextraposition in (L3) will be attached only to the appropriateverbs).
4)it, l )  wird: V, (t  PRED) = "wel'den <(XCOMP)> (SUBJ) 'I((I TENSE) = futureSUBJ CASE) = n~l(t  SUB J )=  ( t  XCOMP SUB J)(t  XCOMP INF) =c en(L2) haben: V, (~ PRED) = "haben <(XCOMP)> (SUB J)"((I I~IF) =enSUB J) = (~ XCOMP SUB J)(t  XCOMP INF) =e ge(L3) versucht: V, (C PRED) = "versuchen <(SUBJ) (XCOMP)>"(t INF) = ge(~ SUBJ)= (~ XCONP SUB J)XCOMP INF) =C zu(t  XCOMP EXTRAPOSII'ION) = +.Given a lexicon of the above format we could use the followingrules to generate the embedded infinitival constructions (1)-(3):tRI) S' "> COMP ~ = 4s 4.

What we want to express isthat the extraposed infinitival construction appears as theright-most daughter of the governing S-node, that it fulfills thefunction of an XCOMP and that it should be embedded in theresulting f-structure at an unpredictably deep level which isdetermined by the number of XCOMPs that have been generated by theself-embedding VP in (R3).
To do this we will expand the rule (R2)by introducing a special VP' category that is annotated by afunctional schema containing a regular expression involving theKleene star on the grammatical function XCOMP (The constrainingequation attached to the VP' nodes serves to make sure that onlythose XCOMPs will be dominated by this node that are governed by anappropriate verb satisfying this constraint through the correspond-ing defining equation in its lexical entry; see above (L3).

(R4) VP' -> VP ~ = 4\[VP' ( t  XCOMP* XCORp) =( t  EXTRAPOSITION) =c +\].These rules will produce the following c- and f-structures with themetavariables appropriately instantiated.
Although the VP'-nodeappears in the c-structure as an immediate daughter of Sit's corresponding f-structure (f4) is pushed down to thedeepest level of embedding in tire global f-structure.

VERB-SECONDUntil now we have considered only clauses with the finite verb ina final position, and a strict order of nontinal arguments, Inthe following we shall ntodify our rules to cover also verbsecond clauses, restricting ourselves to declaratives.
5)The rule determining the position of the finite verb in Germancan be informally expressed by the following generalization:The finite verb appears in a clause final position iff the firstposition of the sentence is taken by a conjunction, or by arelative or (subordinative) interrogative prononn.
If these con-ditions do not apply we ",viii assume that the finite verb takes theposition that is dominated by COMP in (Rl).
In this case theposition in front of the finite verb, which we will assume to be(laminated by S" , may be filled by any major constituent(including VP).
As this position is by no nteans lestrieted to be aSUBJ~posltion, we will introduce a variable G ranging ovtu thefull set of governable functions (including XCOMP).
6)Furthermore wt, ~ have to take into consideration, that only thesurface realization S\[JBJ will always appear on the top-levelof the global f-structure, whereas any other function may belongto a deeper level of f-structnre mbedding.
So we will again makeuse of an annotation involving the Kleene--star operator, yielding('1' XCOMP* G) = "~.
Thus we will be able to topicalize anygovernable function xto matter, how deep it be embedded in the VP orVP' structures.
The principle of consistency will again guaranteethat no governable function will appear in this position that isnot subcategorized for by a verbal predicate that can be reachedalong an f-structure path consisting of XCOMPs only.
Restrictingthe f-structure path to XCOMPs will make sure that nogovernable function be 'extracted' from inside a complex NP or somenode annotated as ADJUNCT.
7)Another important modification concerns our S-rule: In order toavoid constituent control as well as a VP rule expanding to anol)tional V constituent, we 'flatten' the S rule, making allits immediately dominated constituents optional.
The principle ofconsistency will then make sure that one and only one position forthe verb will be selected.
The existential constraint requiringtense will hold for both the final and the front position.

GERMAN AS A FREE WORD ORDER LANGUAGEfit the htst section we assumed that it will be only the sentenceiuitial positions that can be filled by any major constituents.However there is little reason to assmne that the linear order ofnominal arguments will always follow the pattern produced bythe original rules (R2) and (R3):(16) dass dem Erf inder diese Entdeckung gehmgen ist.to the inventor thi!
; discovery succeeded has(17) dass dem Mann jemand ein Buclt geschenkt hat.to the mnn somebody a book g iven has(18) d.ss  ibm dos linch jemand geschenkt hat.hirn t i le book soli\]ebody g iven has(19) dasses  ihm jemand geschelt\]?l h(zl.i t  hba sc~nobody given has(20) dass siclt der Mann zu bewegen begann,h imse l f  t i le man to iilove s tar ted(21) dass ihn eine Studentin zu kuessen versuchte.him a student  (femote) to k iss  t r ied(22) dass einc Studentin ihn versucht hat zu kuessen.a student  hil l l  t r ied  has to k iss(23) dass ihn eine Studentin versucht hat zu kuessen,hinl a s tudent  t r ied  has to kiss(24) dass es ihm jemand xu &,sen versproehen hat.i t  to him somebody to read promised has(25) dass sic" ihm dos Buch \[ hat \[\[geben\] wollen\]\].she IHm the book has g iven uanted495(16) is representative for a class of verbs which require an un-marked linear order OBJ2 < SUBJ.
(17)-(19) show some per-mutations of SUBJ, OBJ and OBJ2 which seem to obey somelinear precedence rules relating to a definiteness-scale for nounphrases.
In (20) and (21) an argument depending on a verbgoverned by an equi verb precedes the subject of this equiverb.
In the extraposition variants (22) and (23) of the embeddedstructure (21) the verbs are extraposed while leaving behind theirarguments.
In (24) the linear order of nominal arguments has been'reversed' to yield a structure comparable to some Dutchinfinitival constructions.
In (25) the finite verb separates theall objects from heads appearing in a left-branching verb complex.All of these sentences have in common that tim arguments of someembedded verb(s) are separated from their head(s) by someconstituent belonging to a higher level of f-structure mbedding,i.e.
they are obviously not derivable by a simple self-embedding c-structure rule.
Basically three different approaches to handlethese cases come to mind:a) One could stick to rule (R2.2) and modify it by introducingseveral NP-positions as left sisters of the SUBJ-NP annotated witha regular expression containing as its rightmost attribute avariable Go ranging over the set of various OBJects:(R2.3) S -> NP* (~ XCOMP* Go) =\[NP ((I SUBJ) = I\]\]\[NP OBJ2)\[NP ((I OSJ) = ~\],3\[VP XCOMP)tv t = *~.Apart from potentially yielding several different c-structureanalyses in eases where the SUBJ has been topicalized, thisrule would only cover tim sentences (16)-(21).b) In addition to the modifications under a) the V constituent inthe VP-rule is made optional and complemented by introducing aV' rule: 9)\[NP (t OBJ) = ~\]\[vP (-~ XCOMP) = t \ ]iv, i = tl.
(R7) V' -> iV' (~ XCOMP) = V(\]v t : trv' (t XCOMP) = f(~ INF =c en\].A rule system of this format (if annotated appropriately) seems tohandle the double infinitive cases as well as some of theextraposition structures quite nicely, however it has severalmajor disadvantages: As the clause final verb-complex can begenerated by the VP or the V' rule (or both), in many cases thiscould lead to multiple c-structure ambiguities for identical inputstrings with identical f-structure outputs.
To make sure that theverbs appear in a 'coherent' structure obeying the constraintson possible topicalization and extraposition, quite a number ofadditional constraining rules presumably will be necessary.Finally, as in this rule system c-structure derivations may not beavoidable, that follow a rule likevp -> vP ( I  XCOMp) = f.(i.e.
violate the constraint for valid c-structure derivationsKaplan/Bresnan (1982: 266f)), a slight increase in the generativepower of the system may be the consequence.c) The VP is given up altogether in non-peripheral positions.
Wedefine a variable ranging over the set of grammatical functionsthat may be fulfilled by NPs (let's call it Gs) and modify ourrules in the following way:Range of Variebtes:G =: { SUBJ, OgJ, OBJ2, XCOMP )GS { SUBJ, ogJ, OBJ2 \]'Go =: C ogJ, OgJ2 }(NO), (RI), (RS), (R6)(R2.4) S ->(R3.2) VP ">(R7.1) V' ">UP*  (1 XCOMP* Gs) = ~,1iv t : tI t  XCOMP INF =c en\]iV ~ xcoNP) = ~,\]tv t = t \ ]\[VP (1 XCORP* XCOMP) =iV(EXTRAPOSITION) =c +\] .,,P.
II %= \[V' XCOMP) =v t=t\[vp (I' XCOMP* XCOMp) = f(~ EXTRAPOSITION) =c +\].V4.
CONCLUSIONAs we mentioned in the introduction, the analysis proposed in 4.c)is a very radical solution which in its present form pre-supposes that German is a (relatively) free word order language.Its advantages hould be obvious from the examples given above:Free word order in the domain of nominal arguments,extraposition and topicalization of incomplete VP-nodes etc.
can beeasily covered, its disadvantages might be limitable by theintroduction of linear precedence rules.
Still, the idea offunctional incertainty certainly represents an interestingmechanism, that could make it much easier to get things out oforder.Footnotes:I) Tllis paper has been based on research presently carried out at theDepartment of Linguistics, Stuttgart, sponsored by the BUNDESHINISTERFUER FORSCHUNG UND TECHNOLOGiE (BMFT) (grant no.

The paper on'functions( incerteinty' by KAPLAN / 2AENEN to our knowledge has not beenpublished yet; our use of this mechanism is for the moment restrictedinsofar as we will allow only iterations on XCOMPs and that we do notpermit regular expressions to appear in functional centre( equations.3) The infinitival constructions in German ere described in great detailin BECH (1955), which has been claimed to be an early version of Bresnan'stheory of control.4) The syntax of our grammar rules follows the syntax accepted by theStuttgart LFG-system (see EISELE / DOERRE this vol.
