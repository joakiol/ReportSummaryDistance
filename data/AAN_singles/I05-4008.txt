Taiwan Child Language Corpus:Data Collection and AnnotationJane S. TsayInstitute of Linguistics, Chung Cheng UniversityMin-Hsiung, Chia-Yi  621, Taiwanlngtsay@ccu.edu.twAbstractTaiwan Child Language Corpus containsscripts transcribed from about 330 hoursof recordings of fourteen young childrenfrom Southern Min Chinese speakingfamilies in Taiwan.
The format of thecorpus adopts the Child Language DataExchange System (CHILDES).
The sizeof the corpus is about 1.6 million words.In this paper, we describe data collection,transcription, word segmentation, andpart-of-speech annotation of this corpus.Applications of the corpus are alsodiscussed.1  Data CollectionTaiwan Child Language Corpus (TAICORP) isa corpus of text files transcribed from the childspeech recorded between October 1997 throughMay 2000.
The target language is Southern MinChinese spoken in Taiwan.1.1  ChildrenAll fourteen children participated were fromTaiwanese-speaking families in Min-HsiungVilllage, Chiayi County, Taiwan.There were nine boys and five girls, agedfrom one year two months to three years andeleven months at the beginning of the project.More than half of the children were recordedover more than two years.1.2  RecordingsThe recordings were made through regularhome visits.
Spontaneous speech of thesechildren at play was recorded using Mini Discrecorders.
The interval of the sessions wasabout two weeks.
There were totally 431recording sessions, each 40 to 60 minutes long,totaling about 330 hours.1.3  TranscriptionEach recording session was transcribed into aseparate text file, using Chinese orthography.For words that do not have a conventionalizedwritten form, the Taiwan Southern Minromanization system, i.e., Taiwan Southern MinPinyin was used.About half of the sessions (from childrenunder two and a half years old) also havephonetic transcription in unicode IPA(International Phonetic Alphabet).The three primary transcribers, who werealso the investigators who did the recordings,were well-trained linguists.
All recordings werefirst transcribed by the investigator of thespecific session and then checked by the othertwo transcribers.2  Text files in CHILDES formatTAICORP adopts the format of CHILDES(Child Language Data Exchange System),originally set up by Elizabeth Bates, BrianMacWhinney, and Catherine Snow, to transcribeand code the recordings of child speech intomachine-readable text (MacWhinney & Snow1985, MacWhinney 1995).The main components of CHILDES formatare headers and tiers.2.1  HeadersObligatory headers are necessary for everyfile.
They mark the beginning, the end andthe participants of the file.Constant headers mark the name of the fileand the background information of thechildren.56Changeable headers contain information thatcan change within the file, such as therecording date, duration, coders and so on.These headers begin with @, for example:Obligatory headers:@Begin@End@ParticipantsConstant headers:@Age of XXX:@Birth of XXX:@Coder:@Educ of XXX:@Filename:@ID:@Language:@Language of XXX:@SES of XXX: social and economicstatus of a specific speaker@Sex of XXX:@Warning:  the defects of the fileChangeable headers:@Activities:@Comment:@Date:@Location:@New Episode:@Room Layout:@Situation:@Tape Location:@Time Duration:@Time Start:2.2  TiersThe content of a file is presented in tiers,including main tiers and dependent tiers.
A maintier, indicated by *, contains the utterance of thespeaker.Main tiersThe main tiers used in TAICORP include thefollowing:?
?INV: the utterance of the investigator?
?CHI: the utterance of the target child?
?MOT: the utterance of mother?
?FAT: the utterance of father?
?SIS: the utterance of sister?
?BRO: the utterance of brother?
?GRM: the utterance of grandmother?
?GRF: the utterance of grandfather?
?OTH: the utterance of other peopleThe main tier is the most important tierbecause it is where the utterances are listed.
Theutterances in the main tier were transcribed inthe romanization (pinyin) system of TaiwanSouthern Min (to be explained and illustrated inSection 5).Dependent TiersAdditional information is given in dependenttiers, indicated by %, following the main tier.Dependent tiers can be changed according tothe design and goals of each corpus.The dependent tiers used in TAICORPinclude the following:%ort: transcription in standard orthography%cod: part-of-speech coding%pho: phonetic transcription in IPA%ton: tone value in 5-point scaleFor adults' speech, only %ort and %codtiers are used.
For younger children's speech,%pho and %ton tiers are also used.

?Table 1  Statistics of the corpusIt might be worth mentioning that theMLU of adults in this corpus is relatively short.This could be attributed to the nature of thiscorpus as being child-directed speech.4  Part-of speech annotationSouthern Min and Mandarin are both Siniticlanguages.
They are very similar in theirmorphology and syntactic structures.
Therefore,we adopted the part-of-speech coding system ofthe Sinica Corpus, Academia Sinica, Taiwan(see various CKIP technical reports).
However,among the 115 categories used in the SinicaCorpus (CKIP 1993), only 46 codes were usedin TAICORP.
In other words, categorization inTAICORP is broader.
These codes are listed inTable 2.Table 2  Part-of-Speech Tagset in TAICORPCoding Part-of-speechA non-predicative adjectiveCaa coordinate conjunctionCab listing conjunctionCba conjunction occurring at the endof a sentenceCbb following a subjectDa possibly preceding a nounDfa preceding VH through VLDfb following adverbDi post-verbalDk sentence initialD adverbialNa common nounNb proper nounNc location nounNcd localizerNd time nounNeu numeral determinerNes specific determinerNep anaphoric determinerNeqa classifier determinerNeqb postposed classifier determinerNf classifierNg postpositionNh pronounI interjectionP prepositionT particleVA active intransitive verbVACVB active pseudo-transitive verbVC active transitive verbVCL transitive verb taking a locativeargumentVD ditransitive verbVE active transitive verb withsentential objectVF active transitive verb with VPobjectVG classifactory verbVH stative intransitive verbVHC stative causitive verbVI stative pseudo-transitive verbVJ stative transitive verbVK stative transitive verb withsentential object58VL stative transitive verb with VPobjectV_2DE *special tag for the word "?

2"5  Orthography-related issues for aspeech-based corpus of Southern Min5.1  Romanization systemAs mentioned in Section 2, utterances in themain tier are transcribed in romanization(Southern Min pinyin).
The romanizationsystem used in TAICORP is the TaiwanSouthern Min Phonetic Alphabetic (also knownas Taiwan Language Phonetic Alphabet, TLPA,originally proposed by the Taiwan LanguageSociety in 1991) announced officially by theMinistry of Education of Taiwan in 1998.5.2 Standard orthography: ChinesecharactersChinese characters are used in the dependenttier %ort as the standard orthography.
This is areasonable way because most of the SouthernMin words are cognates of Mandarin words.However, because Southern Min does not haveas conventionalized orthography as Mandarin,quite a few words in Southern Min do not havea consistent way of writing them.
Some of themdon't even have very obvious correspondingCharacters.In order to ensure consistency in the corpus,Southern Min dictionaries were used.
Thesedictionaries are listed after the References.This issue is particularly important for acorpus based on spontaneous speech, ratherthan written text.
For example, the followingcommon words in Southern Min have to bechecked in the dictionary about their writtenforms because they do not occur in Mandarin:??
!0bang2tah4/ "mosquito net"?
!/ban2/ "to pick"??
0ki5kha2/ "unusual"If a written form cannot be found in one ofthe major Southern Min dictionaries,romanization is used.Romanization is also used if the writtenform of a word is found in the dictionary buthas so low frequency that it can't be found inthe computer coding system.For homonyms, a number is added afterthe character to indicate different lemmas.
Forexample:?
1 0kah4/!!
"to cover with a blanket"?
2 0kham3/!!
"to cover"?
3 0kua3/!!
"a cover"6  The Autosegmentation program and theSpell-checkerIn order to speed up the building of the corpus,a word auto-segmentation program is necessary.Yet, when the program is segmenting wordsfrom the text, it can also deal with some relatedproblems at the same time, such as theconsistency of the transcription, addingromanization, and expanding the lexicon.The Lexicon BankAs the basis of the auto-segmentation programand the spell-cheker, a corpus-based lexicon hasbeen constructed which includes the lemma(both in romanization and in Chinesecharacters), alternative forms, synonyms, andpart-of-speech.
(See the Appendix for a sampleof the lexicon.
)Consistency in the transcriptionTaiwanese speech recognition is still developing,so there is no way to transcribe the data withmachine.
Hence, transcription can only bedone manually.
The transcribers might beinconsistent in choosing the written form.
Forexample, ??
(an3cuann2) "how" can betranscribed as ?
?, ??
?, ?
?, ?
?, ??
and so on.
Therefore, it is very important todesign a program can identify the inconsistency.When the program is segmenting the text,it tries to match a string which matches the59word in the column of "Chinese character" inthe lexicon bank.
It then segments the word andcodes its pinyin.
Figure 1 shows the input textin the frame, and Figure 2 shows the output ofafter segmentation.
Word segmentation standardfollows mostly that of the Sinica Corpus (Chenet al 1996).If the transcription happens to be one ofthe "other forms," it will be replaced with thestandard form listed under the "Chinesecharacter.
"Adding new words to the LexiconIf a word does not exist in the lexicon, it will beadded to the lexicon after the file managerconfirms its status.In short, the word auto-segmentation program isable to do four things at the same time:1  segment words in the text2  code the pinyin for the characters3  correct the inconsistent written forms4  expand the lexicon bank7  Applications of the corpusThis corpus has been used for studies on variousaspects of child language acquisition, includingtone acquisition (Tsay and Huang, 1998; Tsay,Myers, and Chen, 2000; Tsay, 2001), consonantacquisition (Liu and Tsay, 2000), classifieracquisition (Myers and Tsay, 2000), finalparticle acquisition (Hung, Li, and Tsay, 2004),verb acquisition (Lee and Tsay, 2001; Lin andTsay, 2005), vocabulary acquisition (Tsay andCheng, in progress).
More studies are on theway.Because this corpus is based onspontaneous speech, it also has its applicationsin addition to linguistic research.
For example,this corpus can be used in extracting importantspeech features.This corpus will be released by theAssociation for Computational Linguistics andChinese Language Processing, Taiwan, in fall of2005.AcknowledgementsThis project was supported by grants from theNational Science Council, Taiwan.
