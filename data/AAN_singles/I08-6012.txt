Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval System for IndianLanguagesJagadeesh Jagarlamudi and A KumaranAbstractThis paper describes our first participation in the Indian language sub-task ofthe main Adhoc monolingual and bilingual track in CLEF competition.
Inthis track, the task is to retrieve relevant documents from an English corpusin response to a query expressed in different Indian languages includingHindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and Marathi.
Groups participating in thistrack are required to submit a English to English monolingual run and aHindi to English bilingual run with optional runs in rest of the languages.We had submitted a monolingual English run and a Hindi to English cross-lingual run.We used a word alignment table that was learnt by a Statistical MachineTranslation (SMT) system trained on aligned parallel sentences, to map aquery in source language into an equivalent query in the language of thetarget document collection.
The relevant documents are then retrieved usinga Language Modeling based retrieval algorithm.
On CLEF 2007 data set, ourofficial cross-lingual performance was 54.4% of the monolingualperformance and in the post submission experiments we found that it can besignificantly improved up to 73.4%.
