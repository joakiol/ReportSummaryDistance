Domain Structure, Rhetorical Structure, and Text StructurePenelope SibunFuji Xerox Palo Alto Laboratory3400 Hillview AvenuePalo Alto, CA 94304(415) 813-7772s ibun@pal,  xerox ,  comIntroductionIt is generally agreed that text has structure (at least, coherent ext does).
Therefore, an under-standing and appreciation of text structure must play some role in building computational systemsthat are capable of using text as people do.
What is less clear is what are necessary and sufficientsources of structure for a text-using system, and further, what such a system needs to know aboutand do with these structures in the process of using text.
By using text, I mean understanding itor producing it; speaking it, writing it, or thinking about it.
In this paper, I present a case for theimportance of domain structure in structuring text, and discuss the role of rhetorical structure andintentionality.Intentionality and StructureThe purpose of this workshop is to consider traditional and new approaches to identifying andrepresenting structure for text.
The workshop title suggests that intentionality, or rather, ourrepresentation of it, has a critical role in text structure.
I have no intention of arguing againstthe existence of intentions; however, I believe this emphasis on intentions in accounting for textstructure is misdirected, for two reasons.The first reason is similar to one that I present in the next section as an argument againstrhetorical relations, namely, that a representation f intentional structure has no explanatory powerin describing at least some texts.
For instance, a speaker's intentions in answering the request,"Please describe for me the layout of this house," are not likely to be more complex than to providea coherent answer.
Knowing about the intention to provide a coherent answer, however, revealsnothing about what actually makes the resulting text coherent.
(Vander Linden, this volume,makes a similar point with respect o written instructional text.
)The second reason is that intentions are typically construed to be entities that are abstract,domain independent, and so forth, divorced from the particulars of how they are expressed.
Inall my work in understanding how text is put together, I have yet to find a use for intentions oconstrued.
Rather, I suspect hat intentionality is so completely diffused throughout the structure118of a text that to consider it as a separate phenomenon is not instructive.
Exploring this issuefurther is beyond the scope of this position paper; I refer readers interested in a fresh perspectiveon intentionality o Batali (1993).Structure: Domain, Rhetorical, and TextIn this paper, I suggest hat, irrespective of their relation to intentions, rhetorical relations, asthey are typically construed 1 (e.g., in Mann and Thompson's Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)(1987)),1. are not sufficient sources of structure for a text-using system; and2.
are not necessary for at least some uses of text.Instead, I take the position that,1.
in order not to be vacuous, rhetorical structure must be grounded in the domain of discourse,and thus cognizant of the structure of that domain; and2.
in some types of text the structure of the domain is a sufficient source for the structure ofthe text, and rhetorical relations are superfluous.I will briefly sketch both parts of this position.
They are discussed in more detail in Sibun (1992,1991), which also describe a working text generation system built according to these principles.To see what is missing from an account of text structure that is solely in terms of rhetoricalstructure, let us consider one of the best known and most thoroughly worked out theories, Mannand Thompson's RST.
Seven of the 23 RST relations are presentational relations, while most (16)are subject matter elations, such as NON-VOLITIONAL CAUSE and SEQUENCE.
Out of combinationsof any of these relations can be built a representation f the structure of a text.
However, while thisrhetorical structure may be a domain independent way of representing how domain knowledge maybe variously ordered, the question remains of what the domain structure is that is being reordereddomain independently.
In other words, since we assume that rhetorical relations are not assignedarbitrarily between clauses, there must be something about the domain itself that constrains thesubject matter elations.Consider, for example, the text produced in response to a request o describe a particularhouse; suppose the house is a large one with a livingroom and a sunporch in the northeast cornerand a diningroom and a kitchen in the southwest comer.
If the text contains these two clauses (thesecond is reduced),there's a sunporchthen a l ivingroomXSee Sidner, this volume, for a discussion ofthe semantic drift of the term "rhetorical" from its use with respectto the dlsclp\]ine ofrhetoric to its current use in computational linguistics.119then the relation SEQUENCE is licensed because the rooms are physically proximate (physical prox-imity is a relation in spatial domains such as houses).
However, if the second clause mentions thediningroom on the other side of the house, no SEQUENCE may be involved, though at the rhetoricalstructure level, it is unclear what other relation could possibly be assigned.
Indeed, the text mayprove to be incoherent, but it is incoherent precisely in virtue of the relations in the domain, notin virtue of the SEQUENCE relations in the rhetorical structure.
(See Sibun (1992) and Kittredgeet al (1991) for further examples of the need for taking domain structure into account.
)I have shown that domain structure is crucial to ascertaining rhetorical structure.
Any systemof rhetorical relations, therefore, can only lay claim to sufficiently accounting for text structureif it is grounded in any domain of discourse to which it is applied, and it knows about how thedomain structure relates to the rhetorical structure.
(Rainbow (1990) calls knowledge about thisrelationship domain communication knowledge.
)If rhetorical structure is not sufficient for accounting for domain structure, a logical questionto ask is whether it is necessary.
I am certain that it is necessary--some of the time.
However,some of the time rhetorical structure does not appear to contribute anything to the structure ofa text.
This can be proved by demonstration: Sallx (Sibun 1991, 1992) can generate multidansalcoherent exts in which the sole source of text structure is domain structure.
Salix has generateddomain-structured texts in domains of houses, families, text style, and airports.One might be tempted to argue that it is important hat rhetorical structure be available for theextent of a text.
Thus, for example, a system generating a domain-structured text would maintaina rhetorical structure composed of a series of SEQUENCE relations.
This rhetorical structure clearlydoesn't shed any light on the text structure, and it has no impact on the generator's decisions;indeed its validity depends directly on the domain structure, bringing us back to the discussionab ore .ConclusionBecause, in the general case, we cannot count on rhetorical structure to be either necessary or suffi-cient to account for text structure, I believe that rhetorical structure should not be the cornerstoneof a computational theory of text structure.
Rather, I think a fresh perspective is needed, in whichrhetorical structure, domain structure, intentional structure, conversational structure, grammaticalstructure, and so forth, are all seen to play a role, none of them privileged, in text structure.
Ithink that if we take all of these sources of structure into account, and emphasize one or more ofthem as seems warranted for the job at hand, we will find our task becomes easier: rather thanappealing to a single abstract heory in discussing all texts, we will be availing ourselves of a richset of tools for understanding each text to the fullest.120ReferencesBatali, J.
