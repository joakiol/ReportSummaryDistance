The lexicon describes valencyfor verbs and also includes links to otherlexical sources, namely PropBank.
Basicstatistics about the lexicon are given.The lexicon will be later used for anno-tation of the Wall Street Journal sectionof the Penn Treebank in Praguian for-malisms.1 IntroductionThe creation of a valency lexicon of English verbsis part of the ongoing project of the Prague En-glish Dependency Treebank (PEDT).
PEDT is be-ing built from the Penn Treebank - Wall StreetJournal section by converting it into dependencytrees and providing it with an additional deep-syntactic annotation layer, working within the lin-guistic framework of the Functional GenerativeDescription (FGD)(Sgall et al, 1986).The deep-syntactic annotation in terms of FGDpays special attention to valency.
Under va-lency we understand the ability of lexemes (verbs,nouns, adjectives and some types of adverbs) tocombine with other lexemes.
Capturing of valencyis profitable in Machine Translation, InformationExtraction and Question Answering since it en-ables the machines to correctly recognize types of?

A va-lency lexicon of verbs is inevitable for the projectof the Prague English Dependency Treebank as asupporting tool for the deep-syntactic corpus an-notation.We are not aware of any lexical source fromwhich such a lexicon could be automatically de-rived in the desired quality.
Manual creation ofgold-standard data for computational applicationsis yet very time-consuming and expensive.
Hav-ing this in mind, we decided to adapt the alreadyexisting lexical source PropBank (M. Palmer andD.
Gildea and P. Kingsbury, 2005) to FGD, mak-ing it comply with the structure of the origi-nal Czech valency lexicons VALLEX (Z?abokrtsky?and Lopatkova?, 2004) and PDT-VALLEX (J. Hajic?et al, 2003), which have been designed for thedeep-syntactic annotation of the Czech FGD-based treebanks (The Prague Dependency Tree-bank 1.0 and 2.0) (J. Hajic?
et al, 2001; Hajic?,2005).
Manual editing follows the automatic pro-cedure.
We are reporting on a work that is stillongoing (which is though nearing completion).Therefore this paper focuses on the general con-ception of the lexicon as well as on its technicalsolutions, while it cannot give a serious evaluationof the completed work yet.The paper is structured as follows.
In Section 2,we present current or previous related projects inmore detail.
In Section 3, we introduce the formalstructure of the EngValLex lexicon.
In Section 4,we describe how we semi-automatically createdthe lexicon and describe the annotation tool.
Fi-nally in Section 5, we state our outlooks for thefuture development and uses of the lexicon.942 Valency Lexicon Construction2.1 FGDThe Functional Generative Description (FGD)(Sgall et al, 1986) is a dependency-based for-mal stratificational language description frame-work that goes back to the functional-structuralPrague School.
For more detail see (Panevova?,1980) and (Sgall et al, 1986).
The theory of FGDhas been implemented in the Prague DependencyTreebank project (Sgall et al, 1986; Hajic?, 2005).FGD captures valency in the underlying syntax(the so-called tectogrammatical language layer).
Itenables listing of complementations (syntacticallydependent autosemantic lexemes) in a valency lex-icon, regardless of their surface (morphosyntac-tic) forms, providing them with semantic labels(functors) instead.
Implicitly, a complementationpresent in the tectogrammatical layer can either bedirectly rendered by the surface shape of the sen-tence, or it is omitted but can be inferred from thecontext or by common knowledge.
A valency lex-icon describes the valency behavior of a given lex-eme (verb, noun, adjective or adverb) in the formof valency frames.2.2 Valency within FGDA valency frame in the strict sense consists of in-ner participants and obligatory free modifications(see e.g.
(Panevova?, 2002)).
Free modificationsare prototypically optional and do not belong tothe valency frame in the strict sense though someframes require a free modification (e.g.
directionin verbs of movement).
Free modifications havesemantic labels (there are some more than 40 inPDT) and they are distributed according to seman-tic judgments of the annotators.
FGD introducesfive inner participants.
Unlike free modifications,inner participants cannot be repeated within oneframe.
They can be obligatory as well as optional(which is to be stated by the judgment on gram-maticality of the given sentence and by the so-called dialogue test, (Panevova?, 1974 75)).
Boththe obligatory and the optional inner participantsbelong to the valency frame in the strict sense.Like the free modifications, the inner participantshave semantic labels according to the cognitiveroles they typically enter: ACT (Actor), PAT (Pa-tient), ADDR (Addressee), ORIG (Origin) andEFF (Effect).
Syntactic criteria are used to identifythe first two participants ACT and PAT (?shifting?,see (Panevova?, 1974 75)).
The other inner partic-ipants are identified semantically; i.e.
a verb withone inner participant will have ACT, a verb withtwo inner participants will have ACT and PAT re-gardless the semantics and a verb with three andmore participants will get the label assigned by thesemantic judgment.2.3 The Prague Czech-English DependencyTreebankIn order to develop a state-of-the-art machinetranslation system we are aiming at a high-qualityannotation of the Penn Treebank data in a for-malism similar to the one developed for PDT.When building PEDT we can draw on the suc-cessfully accomplished Prague Czech-English De-pendency Treebank 1.0 (J.
Cur??
?n and M. C?mejrekand J. Havelka and J. Hajic?
and V. Kubon?
and Z.Z?abokrtsky?, 2004) (PCEDT).PCEDT is a Czech-English parallel corpus,consisting of 21,600 sentences from the WallStreet Journal section of the Penn Treebank 3corpus and their human translations to Czech.
TheCzech data was automatically morphologicallyanalyzed and parsed by a statistical parser onthe analytical (i.e.
surface-syntax) layer.
TheCzech tectogrammatical layer was automaticallygenerated from the analytical layer.
The En-glish analytical and tectogrammatical trees werederived automatically from the Penn Treebankphrasal trees.2.4 The Prague English DependencyTreebankThe Prague English Dependency Treebank(PEDT) stands for the data from Wall Street Jour-nal section of the Penn Treebank annotated in thePDT 2.0 shape.
EngValLex is a supporting toolfor the manual annotation of the tectogrammaticallayer of PEDT.3 Lexicon StructureOn the topmost level, EngValLex consists of wordentries, which are characterized by lemmas.
Verbswith a particle (e.g.
give up) are treated as separateword entries.Each word entry consists of a sequence offrame entries, which roughly correspond to indi-vidual senses of the word entry and contain thevalency information.95Figure 1: EngValLex editor: the list of words and framesEach frame entry consists of a sequence of va-lency slots, a sequence of example sentences anda textual note.
Each valency slot corresponds to acomplementation of the verb and is described bya tectogrammatical functor defining the relationbetween the verb and the complementation, and aform defining the possible surface representationsof the functor.
Valency slots can be marked as op-tional, if not, they are considered to be obligatory.The form is listed in round brackets followingthe functor name.
Surface representations of func-tors are basically defined by combination of mor-phological tags and lemmas.
Yet to save annota-tors?
effort, we have introduced several abbrevia-tions that substitute some regularly co-occurringsequences.
E.g.
the abbreviation n means ?nounin the subjective case?
and is defined as follows:NN:NNS:NP:NPSmeaning one of the Penn Treebank part-of-speech tags: NN, NNS, NP and NPS (colon delim-its variants).
Abbreviation might be defined recur-sively.Apart from describing only the daughter nodeof the given verb, the surface representation candescribe an entire analytical subtree whose top-most node is the daughter of the given verb node.Square brackets are used to indicate descendantnodes.
Square brackets allow nesting to indicatethe dependency relations among the nodes of agiven subtree.
For example, the following state-ment describes a particle to whose daughter nodeis a verb.to.TO[VB]The following statement is an example of a def-inition of three valency slots and their correspond-ing forms:ACT(.n) PAT(to.TO[VB])LOC(at.IN)The ACT (Actor) can be any noun in the sub-jective case (the abbreviation n), the PAT (Patient)can be a particle to with a daughter verb, and theLOC (Locative) can be the preposition at.Moreover, EngValLex contains links to externaldata sources (e.g.
lexicons) from words, frames,valency slots and example sentences.The lexicon is stored in an XML format whichis similar to the format of the PDT-VALLEX lexi-con used in the Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0.4 Creating the LexiconThe lexicon was automatically generated fromPropBank using XSLT templates.
Each PropBankexample was expanded in a single frame in thedestination lexicon.
When generating the lexicon,we have kept as many back links to PropBank aspossible.
Namely, we stored links from framesto Propbank rolesets, links from valency slots toPropBank arguments and links from examples toPropBank examples.
Rolesets were identified bythe roleset id attribute.
Arguments were identifiedby the roleset id, the name and the function of the96role.
Examples were identified by the roleset idand their name.After the automatic conversion, we had 8,215frames for 3,806 words.Tectogrammatical functors were assigned semi-automatically according to hand-written rules,which were conditioned by PropBank arguments.It was yet clear from the beginning that manualcorrections would be necessary as the relations ofArgs to functors varied depending on linguistic de-cisions1 .The annotators were provided with an anno-tation editor created on the base of the PDT-VALLEX editor.
Apart from interface for editingEngValLex, the tool contains integrated viewersof PropBank and VerbNet, which allows offlinebrowsing of the lexicons.
Those viewers can berun as a stand-alone application as well and arepublished freely on the web2.
The editor allowsthe annotator to create, delete, and modify wordentries, and frame entries.
Links to PropBank canbe set up, if necessary.Figure 1 displays the main window of the editor.The left part of the window shows list of words.The central part shows the list of the frames con-cerning the selected verb.For the purpose of annotation, we divided thelexicon into 1,992 files according to the name ofPropBank rolesets (attribute name of the XML el-ement roleset), and the files are annotated sepa-rately.
When the annotation is finished, the fileswill be merged again.
Currently, we have about80% of the lexicon annotated, which already con-tains the most difficult cases.5 OutlookWe have annotated the major part of EngValLex.In the final version, a small part of the lexicon willbe annotated by a second annotator in order to de-termine the inter-annotator agreement.The annotation of the Prague English Depen-dency Treebank on the tectogrammatical level willbe started soon and we will use EngValLex for as-signing valency frames to verbs.
The annotation1E.g.
Arg0 typically corresponds to ACT, and Arg1 toPAT when they co-occur.
Yet, a roleset including an inchoa-tive sentence (The door.ARG1 opened.)
and a causative sen-tence (John.Arg0 opened the door.Arg1) will be split into twoFGD frames.
The causative frame will keep Arg0?ACT andArg1?PAT whereas the inchoative will get Arg1?ACT.2 http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/?semecky/software/{propbank|verbnet}viewer/will be based on the same theoretical backgroundas the Prague Dependency Treebank.Due to the PropBank links in EngValLex, wewill be able to automatically derive frame anno-tation of PEDT from PropBank annotation of thePenn Treebank.As the Wall Street Journal sentences are manu-ally translated into Czech, we will be able to ob-tain their Czech tectogrammatical representationsautomatically using state-of-art parsers.A solid platform for testing Czech-English andEnglish-Czech machine translation will be given.In the future we will also try to improve the trans-lation by mapping the Czech PDT-ValLex to theEnglish EngValLex.ReferencesJ.
