The main task wasthe technical survey task, where participantstried to retrieve relevant patents to news ar-ticles.
In this paper, we introduce the taskdesign, the patent collections, the character-istics of the submitted systems, and the re-sults overview.
We also arranged the free-styled task, where participants could tryanything they want as far as the patent col-lections were used.
We describe the briefsummaries of the proposals submitted to thefree-styled task.1 IntroductionIn the field of information retrieval, there havebeen held successive evaluation workshops, suchas TREC [8], CREF [1], and NTCIR [5], to buildand utilize various kinds of test collections.
In theThird NTCIR Workshop (NTCIR-3), which washeld from June 2001 to December 2003, a seriouseffort was first made in the ?Patent Retrieval Task?to explore information retrieval targeting patentdocuments.The goal of Patent Retrieval Task is to providetest collections for enhancing research on patentinformation processing, from patent retrieval topatent mining.
Although there exist many com-mercial patent retrieval systems and services, pat-ent retrieval has not been paid much attention inthe research field of information retrieval.
One ofthe reasons is the lack of test collection on patent.TREC used patent documents as a part of thedocument collections, but there was no treatmentspecially applied to the patent collection.In SIGIR2000, the first workshop on patent re-trieval was held [4] and there were many fruitfuldiscussions on the current status and future direc-tions of patent retrieval.
The workshop convincedus that there was the need of test collections spe-cifically for patents.We then asked for PATOLIS Co. [7] to providepatent collections for the patent retrieval task.
Con-sequently, we could release three kinds of patentcollections; those were two years?
Japanese fulltexts, five years?
Japanese abstracts, and fiveyears?
English abstracts.
At the same time, wecould fortunately have cooperation with JIPA (Ja-pan Intellectual Property Association) [3] in creat-ing search topics and assessing the relevance.Since each member of JIPA belongs to the intellec-tual property division in her/his company, they areall experts in patent searching.
All the abovecontributions enabled us to kick off the firstevaluation workshop designed for patentinformation processing.There are various phases and aspects in patentinformation processing.
For example, variouskinds of users (researchers, patent searchers, busi-ness managers, and so on) search patents for vari-ous purposes (technical survey, finding conflictingapplications, buying/selling patents, and so on).Corresponding to each situation, an appropriatesearch model should be developed.
The standard ofthe relevance judgments may also depend on eachsituation.
In some cases, retrieving relevant patentsis not enough but further analysis on the retrievedpatents might be necessary.
For example, creatinga patent map of a product would clarify the patentrelations between the techniques used to make theproduct.
Cross-lingual patent retrieval is also im-portant when applying patents to foreign countries.All of these are within scope of our project and thistask was the first step toward our goal.2 Task DesignIn this workshop, we focused on a simple task oftechnical survey.
End-users we assumed in the taskwere novice users, for example, business managers.The major reason of adopting such general taskwas that we could only use the two years?
full textsthat were not enough for trying more patent-oriented task like finding conflicting applicationsfrom patents.Figure 1: Scenario of technology surveyTo fit the task to a real situation, we used Japa-nese news articles as the original sources of searchtopics, so the task was conducting cross-databaseretrieval, searching patents by news articles.
Thetask assumed the following situation that is de-picted in Figure 1.
When a business manager looksthrough news articles and is interested in one ofthem, she/he clips it out and asks a searcher to findrelated patents to the clipping.
The manager passesthe clipping to the searcher along with her/hismemorandum, and this clipping with memorandumbecame the search topic in this task.
The memo-randum helps the searcher to have the exact infor-mation need the manager has, when the clippingcontains non-relevant topics or the clipping haslittle description on the information need.
Taskparticipants played the role of the searcher andtried to retrieve relevant patents to the clipping.Since the purpose of the searching was technicalsurvey, the claim part in patent was not treatedspecifically in assessing the relevance.
Patentdocuments were treated as if those were technicalpapers.Cross-database retrieval itself is so general thattechniques investigated in the task can be appliedto various combinations of databases.
This is an-other purpose of the task.We prepared search topics in four languages,Japanese, English, Korean, and Chinese (both tra-ditional and simplified).
Participants could trycross-lingual patent retrieval by using one of thenon-Japanese topics.
Unfortunately, only twogroups submitted cross-lingual results and both ofthem used English topics.In addition to the technical survey task ex-plained so far, we arranged the optional task,where participants could try anything they want asfar as they used the patent collections provided.One of the purposes of this free-styled task is toexplore next official tasks.3 Characteristics of Patent ApplicationsIn this section, we briefly review the characteristicsof patent applications (patent documents).?
There are structures, for example, claims,purposes, effects, and embodiments of theinvention.?
Although the claim part is the most impor-tant in patent, it is written in an unusual styleespecially for Japanese patent; all the sub-topics are written in single sentence.?
To enlarge the scope of invention, vague orgeneral terms are often used in claims.?
Patents include much technical terminology.Applicants may define and use their originalterms not used in other patents.?
There are large variations in length.
Thelongest patent in our collections containsabout 30,000 Japanese words!?
The search models would be significantlydifferent between industries, for example,between chemical / pharmaceutical indus-tries and computers / machinery / electricindustries.?
Classification exists.
IPC (International Pat-ent Classification) is the most popular one.?
The criterion of evaluation depends on thepurpose of searching.
For example, high re-call is required for finding conflicting appli-cations.?
In some industries, images are important tojudge the relevance.Our task focused on few of the above character-istics.
We treated patent documents as technicaldocuments rather than legal statements, so we didnot distinguish between the claim part and the oth-ers in assessing the relevance.
High recall was notnecessary, so we used the standard averaged preci-sion to evaluate the results.
Few groups used struc-tures and classifications.
Images were not includedin the patent collections provided.4 Patent CollectionsPATOLIS Co. provided and we released the fol-lowing patent collections.?
kkh: Publication of unexamined patent ap-plications (1998, 1999) (in Japanese)?
jsh: JAPIO Patent Abstracts (1995?1999)(in Japanese)?
paj: Patent Abstracts Japan (1995?
1999) (inEnglish)?Kkh?
contains full texts of unexamined patentapplications in Japanese.
Images were eliminated.?Jsh?
contains human edited abstracts in Japanese.Although all the texts in ?kkh?
have the abstractswritten by the applicants, experts in JAPIO (JapanPatent Information Organization) [2] short-ened/lengthened about half of them to fit the lengthwithin about 400 Japanese characters.
They alsonormalized technical terms if necessary.

Here, we see parallel relations,for example, full texts vs. abstracts, original ab-stracts vs. edited abstracts, and Japanese abstractsvs.
English abstracts.
Researchers can use theseparallel collections for various purposes, for exam-ple, finding rules of abstracting, creating a termnormalization dictionary, acquiring translationknowledge, and so on.Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of thethree collections.kkh jsh pajType Full text Abstract AbstractLanguage Japanese Japanese EnglishYears 98,99 95-99 95-99Number ofdocuments697,262 1,706,154 1,701,339Bytes 18139M 1883M 2711MTable 1: Characteristics of the patent collections5 TopicsJIPA members created topics, six for the dry runand 25 for the formal run.
Since the topics for thedry run were substantially revised after the dry run,we decided to re-use those in the formal run.
Inconsequence, we had the total 31 topics for theformal run.Figure 3 is an example of the topics in Englishand Table 2 shows the explanations of the fields inthe topics.
In our task, <ARTICLE> and<SUPPLEMENT> correspond to the news clippingand the memorandum respectively.The topics also contain <DESCRIPTION> and<NARRATIVE> fields we are familiar with.
Sincemany NTCIR tasks already have the results forusing <DESCRIPTION> and <NARRATIVE>fields, we can compare our results of using thesefields with the results of other tasks.Along with the grade of relevance (i.e., ?A?,?B?, ?C?, or ?D?
), each judged patent has a mark(?S?, ?J?, or ?U?)
representing the origin fromwhich the patent was retrieved.
Table 3 explainsabout the marks.
For example, a document with?BJ?
means that the document was judged as ?par-tially relevant?
(i.e.
?B-?)
and only found by ex-perts in their preliminary search (i.e., ?-J?
).Here, note that all the submitted runs contrib-uted to collecting the ?S?
patents, but only the top30 patents for each run were used.
Note also thatwe can restore the patent set retrieved by the man-ual search (i.e., ?PJ?
set) by collecting ?J?
and ?U?patents.<TOPIC><NUM>P004</NUM><LANG>EN</LANG><PURPOSE>technology survey</PURPOSE><TITLE>Device to judge relative merits by comparingcodes such as barcodes with each other</TITLE><ARTICLE><A-DOC><A-DOCNO>JA-981031179</A-DOCNO><A-LANG>JA</A-LANG><A-SECTION>Society</A-SECTION><A-AE>No</A-AE><A-WORDS>189</A-WORDS><A-HEADLINE>BANDAI lost a lawsuit for piracy filed byEPOCH at Tokyo District Court</A-HEADLINE><A-DATE>1998-10-31</A-DATE><A-TEXT>In settlement of the lawsuit filed by EPOCHINC., the toy manufacturer, against BANDAI CO., LTD.

One groupsubmitted runs only for pooling.
We briefly de-scribe the characteristics of each group.
Refer tothe proceedings of Patent Retrieval Task [6] foreach detail.LAPIN: This group focused on the ?term distil-lation?
in cross-database retrieval, where the dif-ference between the term frequency in sourcedatabase and that in target database was integratedinto the overall term weighting.SRGDU: This group tried several pseudo rele-vance feedback methods in the context of patentretrieval.
The proposed method using Taylor for-mula was compared with the traditional Rocchiomethod.daikyo: This group made long gram-based in-dex from the patent collections.
Compared with thetraditional gram-based indexing, proposed methodproduce more compact index.DTEC: This group searched various kinds ofabstracts rather than full texts, and compared theeffectiveness of those.
The abstracts were JAPIOpatent abstracts and the combinations of ?title?,?applicant?s abstract?, and ?claims?.
Manual andautomatic runs were compared.DOVE: This group also submitted manual andautomatic runs.
In the manual runs, non-relevantpassages in <ARTICLE> were eliminated manu-ally.IFLAB: This group evaluated their cross-lingual IR system PRIME through several mono-lingual runs.
They also evaluated their translationextraction method by using Japanese-US patentfamilies, which were not provided in this task.brkly: This group submitted both monolingualand cross-lingual runs.
In the cross-lingual runs,words in English topics were translated into Japa-nese words by using English-Japanese dictionaryautomatically created by the aligned bilingual cor-pus (i.e., ?paj?
and ?jsh?).
Their method of creatingthe dictionary is based on word co-occurrence withthe association measure.sics: This group also submitted cross-lingualruns, where they automatically created a cross-lingual thesaurus form the aligned bilingual corpus,?paj?
and ?jsh?, and used the thesaurus for word-based query translation.
The Random Indexingvector-space technique was used to extract thecross-lingual thesaurus.
Note that, in both the?sics?
and the ?brkly?
groups, there was no mem-ber who understands Japanese.6.26.36.47Recall/PrecisionThe recall/precision graphs of the mandatory runsare shown in Figure 4, and those of the optionalruns in Figure 5.
In each figure, there are both re-sults for the strict relevance (?A?)
and the relaxedrelevance (?A?
+ ?B?).
For each run in the figures,brief system description is specified; the descrip-tion includes the searching mode (automatic ormanual), the topic fields used in query construction,and the topic language.Topic-by-topic ResultsFigure 6 shows the median of the average preci-sions for each topic.
Figure 7 shows the breakdownof the relevance judgments.
Detailed analysis oneach topic will be given by JIPA, where it will bediscussed about the reasons why systems could notfind some patents human experts found and viseversa.Recall of the relevant patents retrieved inthe preliminary human searchFigure 8 shows the recall of the relevant patentsretrieved in the preliminary human search.
In theprocess of making pool, we used only the top 30documents for each run.
Here, we extracted moredocuments from each run and investigated howmany human retrieving relevant patents could becovered by the systems.Optional (Free-styled) TaskThe following two groups applied to the optionaltask.
Refer to the proceedings of Patent RetrievalTask [6] for each detail.CRL: This group investigated the method ofextracting various rules from the existing align-ments in patents.
The ?diff?
command of UNIXwas used to find the alignments between JAPIOpatent abstracts and the original abstracts by appli-cants, between claims and embodiments, and be-tween different claims in an application.TIT: This group focused on the unusual style ofJapanese claims, and tried to automatically struc-ture the claims to raise the readability of claims.Rhetorical structure analysis was applied for thispurpose.8 Summary and Future DirectionsIn this paper, we described the overview of patentretrieval task at NTCIR-3.
We are planning to con-tinue our effort for the next patent retrieval taskalong with the following directions.?
Longer range of years will be covered.?
Purpose of search would shift to more realone, for example, searching conflicting ap-plications.AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to PATOLIS Co. for providing thepatent collections of this task.
We also thank all themembers of JIPA who created the topics and as-sessed the relevance.
Without their expertise inpatent, this task would not be realized.
Lastly, wethank all the participants for their contributions tothis task.References[1] CLEF (Cross Language Evaluation Forum)(http://clef.iei.pi.cnr.it/)[2] JAPIO (Japan Patent Information Organization)(http://www.japio.or.jp/)[3] JIPA (Japan Intellectual Property Association)(http://www.jipa.or.jp/)[4] ACM-SIGIR Workshop on Patent Retrieval, or-ganized by Mun-Kew Leong and Noriko Kando,2000.
