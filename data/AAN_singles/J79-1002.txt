It consists of a parsing program, a large-coverage b~glish gram-mar,  and a Icsicon.
Thc gramnlarls effcctivcncss in parsing texts is due in large part to asubstantial Imdy of detail cvl \vc.Il -formedness rcst rictions which eliminate most incorrect syn-tactic parses which would be allo~vecl by a weaker grammar.
The restrictions mainly test forcompatible combinations of word subclasses.This paper dcfines the 109 adjective, noun and verb suhclasscs.
These subolasses, as\'ell as others not prcscnted herc, are defined Ln such a way that they can he used as a guidefor dassifymg new entries to the LSP lexicon and as a lingpistic reference twl.
Fach defi-nition lncludcs a statement of the intent of tllc subclass, a diawostic frame, sentence examplesand a worcl list draun from tho present dictionary.
The subclasses are defined tro reflect pre-cisely the grammatical propertics tested for by the restrictiol~s of the grammar Where neces-sary for clariking the intent of the subclass, three additiollal criteria are employed: excision,implicit and co- rcfcrcncc, and paraphrase.
The subclasscs have been defined so as to be con-sistent with a subsecluent stage of transformational analysis rilzicl~ is  currently being imp1 e -mentd.An illustration of the trcatmcnt of a subclass is:AASP:an aclicctive is in AASP i f  it occursonly with the non-sentehtial hon-Sh7 rightadjunct to V OBJ (SN an emlxdded, orcontained, sentence) (DSNG , 7) :John is able to walk.John is able for Bill to walk.$John is  able that Bill walks.2 John i s  able whether Bill ~vall;s.Adjectives which occur with both non-Examples:John is - free to leave.She is - fit to ulorkThe book is a~& tn fall.You are @to be asked for money.sentential and sentential right adjuncts arc rt is a~& to nr assumed that John left.not in- AASP (see ASENTI, ASENT:3), e.g.

In string analysis, a sentenceis decomposed into an elementary sentence, or center string, and adjunct strings.
Iil a string,each word class may bapreceded or followed by left or right adjunct  string^,^ and the centerstring as a whole may have adjunct strings ?vhich precede or follow the center string or  occurat interior parts of the string.
A string grammar makes restrictions as to which subclassescan co-occur.
The subclass definitions, therefo~e, are based mainly on these ocburrencepossibilities (e.g., a count noun is specitied as a noun which camiot occur without a precedingarticle).More precisely, the entire computer grammar consists of a set of approximately 200contest-free (BND definitions, a set of a b u t  250 restrictions, and a \lord dictionary.
TheBNF definitions define the center and adjunct strings of the language as well as sentencenominalization (embedded sentence) strings u;hich may occur in subject, object or  complementposition.
In parsing a sentence, once an element of a string (e.g., SUBJECT, VERB, orOBJECT) has been identified in the sentence, restrictioi~s are invoked to test.various pro-perties, including the subclasses of the words ivithin this element or within this element andan element previously identified.When a word is classified for the LSP lexicon it must be assigned to the syntactic classe(N, V, etc.)
which appear in the context-free definitions-and to the specific subclasses (e.g.,count noun) which are tested for by the restrictions.
The trames and definitions are a com-pact statement of these constraints.
Fbr reference to the computer grammar, we have usedthe code names of strings and restrictions, bttt the text can be read independently of the re-ferenced material,The strings have roughly mnemonic names.
An explanation of some of the mnemonicsused in the text is included in the rererence guide which follows this introduction.The restrictions referred to are of several main types: agreement restrictions (AGREInoun phrase restrictions (N) , position restrictions (POS) , quantifier restrictions (Q) , selectiorrestrictions (SEL) , restrictions on sentence embedding (SN) .
and WH-string restrictions m)The name of each restriction is preceded by a W or D and followed by an integer, e.g.
: WAGR'~fi addition to the Noun, Adjective and Verb classes, the other major classes areAdverb, Pronoun, Quantifier, Article, Subordinate Conjunction and Preposition.
CoordinateConjunctions and comparative connectives are treated individually.9 LIn this text, as in the LSP grammar, the notation LXTl (X being a wdrd class, e.g.,N noun V verb, etc.)
stands for X appearing with its optional left adjuncts (LX) and optionalright adjuncts (RX).
X is called the host of its adjunct strings.
Thus, old men with canes isan instance ot LNR in which old -is a left adjunct of the host N man, and with caneq is a right-adjunct of the host N man.-While a subclass is precisely defined by its appearance in the restrictions gf thegrammar, a person who is classifying words for the lexicon may need additional criteriain order to capture the intent oi the subclass.
This is particularly true in defining the verbsubclasses which specify the object strings with which a verb can occur (the OBJIIIST ofthe test).
Here the frames and restrictions may not suffice to distinguish occurrences ofthe words as instances of the subclass from other possible occurrences covered by thegrammar.For example, it is important to distinguish an object string occurrence of SVINGOinsdney kept people working overtime from a non-object-string occurrence of the same word-class sequence,' e.g., one consistingof a noun with its adjunct such as N + reducea relativeVINGO in  They fired people working overtime.
Of course, some verbs will have ambiguousoccurrences, e.g.
,"keep in the first example.
It would' be incorrect, however.
to class - fireas occurring with a SVINGO object on the basis of the second exzmple.
We haye thereforeused additional criteria in defining the object strings in order to clarify the intent of par-ticular subclasses.
The criteria used are:(1) Ekcision.
In an occurrence of an element with its adjunct in a sentence, the adlunctcan be excised leaving a well-formed sentence unchanged in meaning and selection from theoriginal sentence (except for detail added by the adjunct).
Thus, we can test whether a wordsequence in a sentence is an object string occurrence by excising the portion which mightbe an Wjunct.
If the remaining sentence is either different in grammaticality , meaning d rselection from the original sentence, then the sequence as a whole is cansidered an objectstrifig occurrence.
Fbr our purposes, i f  the sequence is an object string octurrence, thenthe verb with which it occurs must be sulxlassed for that object string.
For example, - line,show and c a r x m u s t  be subclassed as occurring with the particle string D P ,  and walk not,-s inc eThey lined up.$ They lined.He showed off.He showed.
(difference in meahing)He cam fed on.The point easried.
(difference in selection)He walked on.He walked.
(no difference in grammaticality, selection ormeaning)(2) Understood reference.
If a given noun in  one sequence-occurrence is understoodas referring to a particular noun N, and, in a different occurrence as referring to an N,,the two occurrences must not be considered as ilistances of the same string.
For example,since messengers in (1) refers to they and messengers in (2) refers to boys, the t~vo occur-rences of as - N must n& be considered a s  the same string:(r) They served the boys a$ messengers.
(2) They treated the boys as messengers.
(3) Paraphrase.
If a semantic contrast can be found in otherwise identical sequeilces,then these sequences cannot be considered as instances of the same string when subclassinghe term %equencen applies to word sequences the structural description of nhichis under discussion.a verb.
For example, the a s  which is equivalent to 'in the capacity oft in (3 )  functions aspart of the object string A ~ B J B I .
: ,  while the as  -which is  equivalent to 'when' in (4) func-tions as part of an adjunct which does not restrict the verl~:(3).
John served as  a lieutenant.
(4) Jollll c h a ~  a s  a lieutenant.hie to the difficulty of judging the appropriateness of a paraphrase, h o ~ ~ e v e r  n.e haveused this criterion sparingly.As we have noted, the frames and definitions precisely reflect the use of the.
majorclasses and subclasses in the presently implemented string grammar.
However, it shouldalso be noted that this grammar, and the associated lexical categories, have been definedso a s  to be consistent with a, subsequent stage of transformational analysis which is currentlybeing implemented.
lh some cases, the same string form has several transformationalsources; where this affects the dictionary classification, we have noted it.Something should be said a b u t  the form of the dictionary entries as they appear inthe computer lexicon.
Each word is classified for all its major class occurrences (N, V,eCc.)
and its subc~asses within each major class.
The classification is based on the usageof the word in the language as a wllole, not its use in a particular text.
Ho\vever, purelycoIloquia1 and literary uses have not been covered because of the intended application toscientific tex-ts.The classificatio~~s of the niords are arranged in a hierarchical structure: the malorclasses may have subelasses and the subclasses in turn may have subclasses.
Fbr esample,the adjective - clear, which can occur as the predicate of a,sentential subject, is in the sub-class AS ENT1.
The particular type of sentential subjects clear occurs with (IVH and THATembeddings) require that it be classified in the two subclasses A\i7H and ATIlAT of ASENTI.This part of the lesical entry appears a s  follows:CLEARADJ: (ASENTI : (AWH, AT-W3)or alternatively :CLEARADJ: .
l o .10 = ASENT.1: (AWH, ATHAT).where the particular line number a s s i w  (.lo) is arbitrary.
Where this type of furthersubdivision of a subclass is i;acessary, a sample dictionary entry is provided along withthe definitions and frames below.It should be noted that while the entries in the lexicoh are  by word rather than stemthe word entries based on a particular stem can refer to portions of a basic entry whichthey share in common, e.g., the object list of a verb (OBJLIST) is specified once for allforms df the verb (tensed verb tV, - present participle Ving, past participle - Ven and infinitiveV).
-The notational conventions used in the subclass definitions and frames are  as follows:2 - an ungrammatical sequencex - - x Rhe underlined term) is the class being subclassed in the frame o r  aparticular lexical item used in the frame.s - - s (the double undarlin.ec1 term) is the class being subclassed in the-frame where the frame also contains a particular lexical item(X) - in a franc!

the specified frame which delimits a word is not the only framein ~vhid.~ fhiZt word can occur; it serves merely as the test frame when classifying words.The presellt paper is an outgrowth of ongoing work on the LSP lexicon throughout itsvarious implementations and applications since 19G5.
