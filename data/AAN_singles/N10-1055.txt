In thispaper we reexamine query ambiguity by ana-lyzing the result clickthrough data.
Previouslyproposed clickthrough-based metrics of queryambiguity tend to conflate informational andambiguous queries.
To distinguish betweenthese query classes, we introduce novel met-rics based on the entropy of the click distri-butions of individual searchers.
Our exper-iments over a clickthrough log of commer-cial search engine demonstrate the benefits ofour approach for distinguishing informationalfrom truly ambiguous queries.1 IntroductionSince query interpretation is the first crucial step inthe operation of the web search engines, more re-liable query intent classification, such as detectingwhether a query is ambiguous, could allow a searchengine to provide more diverse results, better querysuggestions, or otherwise improve user experience.In this paper we re-examine query ambiguityin connection with searcher clickthrough behavior.That is, we posit that clickthrough information couldprovide important evidence for classifying queryambiguity.
However, we find that previously pro-posed clickthrough-based measures tend to conflateinformational and ambiguous queries.
We propose anovel clickthrough measure for query classification,user click entropy, and show that it helps distinguishbetween informational and truly ambiguous queries.Previous research on this topic focused on binaryclassification of query ambiguity.
Notably, (Tee-van et al, 2008) used click entropy as a proxy forquery ambiguity to estimate the potential for searchpersonalization.
(Mei and Church, 2008) consideredclick entropy as measure of search difficulty.
Morebroadly, clickthrough information has been used formany other tasks such as improving search rank-ing (Zhu and Mishne, 2009), learning semantic cat-egories (Komachi et al, 2009), and for topical queryclassification (Li et al, 2008).
However, our worksheds new light on distinguishing between informa-tional and ambiguous queries, by using clickthroughdata.
Our contributions include:?
More precise definition of query ambiguity interms of clickthrough behavior (Section 2).?
Entropy-based formalization of resulting click be-haviors (Section 3).?
Empirical validation of our methods on a largereal query and clickthrough log (Section 4).2 Defining Query AmbiguityIn this study we focus on two orthogonal query in-tent dimensions, adapted from the top level of usergoal taxonomies such as (Rose and Levinson, 2004).Specifically, a query could be ambiguous or unam-biguous; as well as informational or navigational.Consider the example queries of each type below:Ambiguous UnambiguousInformational ?al pacino?
?lyrics?Navigational ?people?
?google?The query ?al pacino?, the name of a famous ac-tor, is a typical ambiguous and informational query.In the clickthrough logs that we examined, the mostpopular searcher destinations include sites with pic-tures of Al Pacino, movie sites, and biography sites ?corresponding to different informational intents.
Incontrast, the query ?lyrics?
has an unambiguous in-formational intent, which is to explore websites withsong lyrics.
For the ambiguous navigational query?people?, popular destinations include people.com,Yahoo People or People?s United Bank.
Finally, the361query ?google?
is unambiguous and navigational,with over 94% of the clicks on the Google?s home-page.Definitions of query classes: we now more for-mally define the query classes we consider:?
Clear: Unambiguous navigational query, such as?google?.?
Informational: Unambiguous informationalquery, such as ?lyrics??
Ambiguous: Ambiguous informational or navi-gational query, such as ?people?
or ?al pacino?.The key challenge in distinguishing the last twoclasses, Informational and Ambiguous, is that theoverall clickthrough patterns for these classes aresimilar: in both cases, there are clicks on many re-sults, without a single dominant result for the query.3 Clickthrough Measures forDistinguishing Ambiguous andInformational QueriesIn this section we describe the features used to rep-resent a query for intent classification, listed in Ta-ble 1.
In addition to popular features such as click-through frequency and query length, we introducenovel features related to user click entropy, to cap-ture the distinction between informational and am-biguous queries.Overall Entropy: Previous methods for query classi-fication utilize entropy of all result clicks for a query,or overall entropy (the uncertainty associated withobtaining a click on any specific result), defined as:H(Rq) = ?
?r?Rqp(r) log p(r)Rq is the set of results r, clicked by all users aftersubmitting the query q.
For example, a clear query?target?
has the overall entropy of 0.36, and mostresults corresponding to this query point to Target?scompany website.
The click log data shows that85% of the users click the Target website for thisquery.
In contrast, an unclear query ?lyrics?
has theoverall entropy of 2.26.
However, overall entropyis insufficient for distinguishing between informa-tional and ambiguous queries.
To fill this gap, weintroduce new clickthrough metrics to detect suchambiguous queries.User Entropy: Recall, that both informationalqueries and ambiguous queries could have high1 2 3051015(a) Overall EntropyFrequencyAmbiguousInformational0.15 0.3 0.45051015(b) User EntropyFrequency InformationalAmbiguousFigure 1: Frequency of ambiguous and informationalqueries by Overall Entropy (a) and User Entropy (b).overall entropy, making it difficult to distinguishthem.
Thus, we introduce a new metric, user en-tropy of a query q H(Uq), as the average entropy ofa distribution of clicks for each searcher:H(Uq) =?
?u?Uq?r?Rup(r) log p(r)|Uq|where Uq is the set of users who have submitted thequery q, and Ru is the set of results r, clicked bythe user u.
For the example informational query?lyrics?, a single user may click many differentURLs, thereby increasing user entropy of this queryto 0.317.
While for an ambiguous query, which hasmultiple meanings, a user typically searches for onlyone meaning of this query at a time, so the resultsclicked by each user will concentrate on one topic.For example, the query ?people?
is ambiguous, andhas the overall entropy of 1.73 due to the varietyof URLs clicked.
However, a particular user usu-ally clicks only one of the websites, resulting in lowuser entropy of 0.007.
Figure 1 illustrates the dif-ference in the distributions of informational and am-biguous queries according to their overall and userentropy values: more informational queries tend tohave medium to high User Entropy values, com-pared to the truly ambiguous queries.Domain Entropy: One problem with the above mea-sures is that clickthrough data for individual URLsis sparse.
A common approach is to backoff tothe URLs domain, with the assumption that URLswithin the same domain usually relate to the sametopic or concept.
Therefore, domain entropy H(Dq)of a query may be more robust, and is defined as:H(Dq) = ?
?d?Dqp(d) log p(d)where Dq are the domains of all URL clicked forq.
For example, the query ?excite?
is a navigationaland clear query, as all the different clicked URLs forthis query are within the same domain, excite.com.362Query Feature DescriptionQueryLength Number of tokens (words) in the queryClickFrequency Number of total clicks for this queryOverallEntropy Entropy of all URLs for this queryUserEntropy* Average entropy of the URLs clicked by one user for this queryOverallDomainEntropy Entropy of all URL domains for this queryUserDomainEntropy* Average entropy of URL domains clicked by one user for this queryRelativeUserEntropy* Fraction of UserEntropy divided by OverallEntropyRelativeOverallEntropy* Fraction of OverallEntropy divided by UserEntropyRelativeUserDomainEntropy* Fraction of UserDomainEntropy divided by OverallDomainEntropyRelativeOverallDomainEntropy* Fraction of OverallDomainEntropy divided by UserDomainEntropyTable 1: Features used to represent a query (* indicates features derived from User Entropy).While this query has high Overall and User Entropyvalues, the Domain Entropy is low, as all the clickedURLs for this query are within the same domain.The features described here can then be used asinput to many available classifiers.
In particular, weuse the Weka toolkit1, as described below.4 Experimental ResultsWe describe the dataset and annotation process, andthen present and analyze the experimental results.Dataset: We use an MSN Search query log(from 2006 Microsoft data release) with 15 millionqueries, from US users, sampled over one month.Queries with click frequency under 10 are discarded.As a result, 84,703 unique queries remained, whichform our universe of queries.
To separately analyzequeries with different frequencies, we divide thequeries into three groups: low frequency group (10-100 clicks), medium frequency group (100-1000clicks) and high frequency group (over 1000 clicks).From each group, we draw a random sample of 50queries for manual labeling, for the total of 150queries.
Each query was labeled by three membersof our lab.
The inter-annotator agreeement was 85%,and Cohen?s Kappa value was 0.77.Table 2 reports the distribution of query classes inour dataset.
Note that low frequency queries dom-inate, but are equally represented in the data sam-ples used for classification training and prediction(we will separately analyze performance on differ-ent query frequency groups).Results: Table 3 shows that best classification re-quired User Entropy features.
The Weka classifierswere Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (Lo-gistic), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).1http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/Clear Informational Ambiguous Frequency (%)High 76% 8% 16% 255 (0.3%)Medium 52% 20% 28% 3802 (4.5%)Low 32% 46% 22% 80646 (95.2%)Table 2: Frequency distribution of different query typesAll Clear Informational AmbiguousAc.

For classification between clearand unclear queries, the accuracy was 90%, preci-sion was 91%, and recall was 90%.
The results forsubsequently classifying ambiguous vs. informationqueries are reported in Table 6.
For this task, UserEntropy features are beneficial, while the ?2 value orOverall Entropy is 0, supporting our claim that UserEntropy is more useful for distinguishing informa-tional from ambiguous queries.Discussion: Interestingly, User Entropy does notshow a large effect on classification of High andMedium frequency queries.
However, as Table 2indicates, High and Medium frequency queries arelargely clear (76% and 52%, respectively).
As dis-cussed above, User Entropy helps classify unclearqueries, but there are fewer such queries amongthe High frequency group, which also tend to havelarger click entropy in general.An ambiguous query is difficult to detect whenmost users interpret it only one way.
For instance,query ?ako?
was annotated as ambiguous, as it couldrefer to different popular websites, such as the sitefor Army Knowledge Online and the company sitefor A.K.O., Inc.
However, most users select the re-sult for the Army Knowledge Online site, makingthe overall entropy low, resulting in prediction asa clear query.
On the positive side, we find thatUser Entropy helps detect ambiguous queries, suchas ?laguna beach?, which was labeled ambiguous asit could refer to both a geographical location and apopular MTV show.
As a result, while the OverallEntropy value of the clickthrough is high, the lowUser Entropy value identifies the query as truly am-biguous and not informational.In summary, our techniques are of most helpfor Low frequency queries and moderately helpfulfor Medium frequency queries.
These results arepromising, as Low frequency queries make up themajority of queries processed by search engines, andalso contain the highest proportion of informationalqueries, which our techniques can identify.5 ConclusionsWe explored clickthrough-based metrics for dis-tinguishing between ambiguous and informationalqueries - which, while exhibiting similar overallclickthrough distributions, can be more accuratelyidentified by using our User Entropy-based features.We demonstrated substantial improvements for low-frequency queries, which are the most frequent inquery logs.
Hence, our results are likely to have no-ticeable impact in a real search setting.Acknowledgments: This work was partially sup-ported by grants from Yahoo!
