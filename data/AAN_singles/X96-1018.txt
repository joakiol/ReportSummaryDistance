Management of Free Text for NDIC: An Overview of the FTM ProjectNancy J. Pruett and Thomas KinsellaOffice of Research and Development,National Drug Intelligence Center, &Intelligence Systems Support Office (OASD C31)SUMMARY:  The FTM Project is a jointproject o build a prototype which retrieves andextracts against free (unstructured) text and toevaluate the prototype's usefulness for theNational Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC).NDIC has strong needs for retrieval andextraction from large multi-source t xtualdatabases.SPONSORS: FFM is jointly sponsored bythe Intelligence Systems Support Office (ISSO)of OASD/C3I, the National Drug IntelligenceCenter (NDIC) and the Office of Research andDevelopment (ORD).
The prototype is beingbuilt and evaluated at the Federal IntelligentDocument Understanding Laboratory (FIDUL)in Tyson's Comers, VA, in an unclassifiedenvironment which replicates the hardware andsoftware nvironment a NDIC.PARTICIPANTS: As of April 15,contractors include BETAC, PRC, IDI, HNCand Lockheed Martin.
BETAC and IDI areproviding the technical leadership, theintegration and the GUI.
PRC is providingTIPSTER expertise (from the TIPSTERSE/CM), and the testing and evaluationleadership (through FIDUL).
HNC and InQuery(via Sovereign Software) are the first detectiontools being integrated.
Lockheed Martin issupplying the TIPSTER compliant documentmanager, document viewer and extractionsystem used on other TIPSTER demonstrationprojects.
Information on lessons learned isshared among all the participants and sponsors.OBJECTIVES: The project objectives(from the Memorandum ofAgreement) are to:Prototype and demonstrate n w technologywhich might be incorporated intoproduction systems at NDIC.
The NDICOASIS/IDEF model and the current NDICfree text management architecturedevelopment will guide project activity.Results will be reported in monthly updatesas well as in a final report.Assemble aprototype which includes atleast wo TIPSTER detection tools workingon source material which represents NDICdata (unclassified).Expand the prototype to include at least woTIPSTER extraction tools, and use theextraction tools to load a database.
Thedatabase will serve as the basis foranalytical tools.Expand the prototype to include conversionof hard copy documents (or the simulationof them), including degraded OCR data.Develop (or acquire) aminimal userinterface and other interfaces which arenecessary to demonstrate integrated use ofdetection and extraction tools, and any otheranalysis tools to be demonstrated.Develop test measures appropriate fortesting these tools in an end-to-end system;test and evaluate the tools.Use the TIPSTER Architecture in thedevelopment, and work closely with theTIPSTER Architecture Working Group(AWG) to improve the Architecture.Explore the implications of the prototypefor an end-to-end architecture, i.e.,expanding the TIPSTER architecture toinclude end-to-end text processing (e.g.,OCR, machine translation and databaseloading).77CONCEPT OF  OPERATIONS:  Theprototype will allow users to choose amongdetection tools, do sophisticated searches onparticular topic s, maintain chosen references todocuments in project files, view thosedocuments either within the detection tool orthrough.a common viewer, "copy and paste"from full text information i to word processingdocuments while retaining the sourceinformation; and extract particular fields andrelationships from project files or any otherTIPSTER collection.THE HARDWARE ANDSOFTWARE ENVIRONMENT:  Thehardware nvironment is a DEC ALPHA 2100server and two Celefis 5100DP (dual Pentium)workstations.
The software nvironmentincludes the Digital OSF Operating Environmenton the server, Windows NT on the workstations,eXceed (an x-windows emulator for WindowsNT), Oracle, and MS Word.
The GUI is beingdeveloped in Visual Basic.SCHEDULE:  The prototype will becompleted by September 30.
Usability testing,some modifications, and testing againstdegraded OCR data will occur by January, 1997.POSS IBLE  FUTURE ADDIT IONS:Once the prototype is complete, other detectionand extraction tools, GUI's, or alternativeTIPSTER-compliant document managers couldeasily be added to the FTM prototype, providingan excellent unclassified environment forcontinuing to evaluate and demonstrateTIPSTER technology.
Other possiblemodifications include fine-tuning the GUI to theNDIC users, and integrating the system into theNDIC environment.78
