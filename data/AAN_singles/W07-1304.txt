Results show good congruencewith linguistic classification and providenew insight on how tackle variousdialectological problems as borrowings.1 IntroductionIn the last decades, theoretical developments in thefield of the biological evolution of species andpopulations have been combined with increasingcomputer facilities, which are likely to change thepractice of phylogeny reconstruction drastically.Attempts to shift such a practice in order toreconstruct the evolution of language have beenproposed, since the middle of the 20th century, asevidenced by several publications that display thewhole range of methodologies.
One of theseapproaches, called Numerical Taxonomy, consistsin estimating some linguistic distances betweenpairs of languages, from which evolutionary treesor networks are inferred to produce some linguisticclassifications.
This approach is classically used indialectometry.
(Evrard, 1964; Goebl, 1981, 1987,Scapoli et al, 2005, Ben Hamed, 2005).
A morerecent approach, based on Bayesian principles,suggests to attach some probabilities to eachlinguistic change (Gray et al 2003), looking for themost likely tree, given the model and the observeddata.
Finally, the last kind of approach, inheritedfrom XIXth century linguists, is the cladisticapproach, as formalized by Hennig (1950) andclearly advocated by some linguists, althoughusing various methodologies (Hoenigswald andWiener, 1987; Wang, 1988; Holden, 2001; Ringeet al, 2002; Rexova et al, 2003; Nakhleh et al,2005; Ben Hamed et al, 2005).The present work is focusing on cladistics,abandoning the purpose of capturing the globalresemblance between languages and the ambitionof giving a rational foundation to probability oflinguistic changes, adopting instead a strategyenabling us to integrate linguistic hypothesesbefore drawing inference on the evolution oflinguistic traits and languages, and possibly torefute them.
To check the heuristic value of thismethodology, we endeavour to apply cladistics todialectal data from different sources, hoping tobring forward and discuss some arguments on theirdiversification in space and time.
As far as weknow, cladistic is more often applied to languagefamilies than to dialect areas, so that our researchis pioneering the field, raising the controversialquestion concerning the best representation ofdialectal diversity: tree-like and/or networks.2 The data2.1 O?l Dialect1.
We began our experiment withthe o?l dialects, our starting point being the1 O?l Dialect indicates the branch of the gallo-Romancelanguages developed in the North of France, south ofBelgium (Walloon Area) and inthe Anglo-Normansislands.23Linguistic Atlas of France (ALF, Gilli?ron andEdmont,1902-1910, reprint: 1968) which hasalready been extensively exploited by others in acontext of global resemblance (Goebl, 1981,1992).
In order to delimit a precise andhomogeneous field, the characters observed arelimited only to the vocalism of these dialects,mainly stressed and oral vowels, even if a fewseries of facts from nasal and unstressed vocalismare taken into account.
As far as the O?l data isconcerned, the selected localities amount to 45,from East to West, in order to limit our scope inthis first attempt (figure 2).ALFBeau <b?llum (13); Bien<b?ne (8); Bl?<bl?tum(11); B?uf <b?vem (5); Cher <c?rum (9);Eau<?quam (14); Fait <f?ctum (5);Faucille<f?lc?culam (8); Faux<f?lcem (15);Feuille<f?liam (11); Fleurs <fl?res (8);Lit<l?ctum (9); M?r <mat?rum (14); M?re<mat?ram (7); Pain<p?nem (15); P?re<p?trem(7); Pied<p?dem (13); Poing<p?gnum (10);Pr?<pr?tum (16); Puits<p?teus(14);Seigle<s?calem (21); Tendre<t?ndere (7);Toile<t?lam (20);ALIBocca < b?ccam (16); Braccio < br?chium (18);Capelli < cap?llos/p?los (19); Dente < d?ntem(18); Dito < d?g?tum (16); Dolce < d?lcem (17);Fegato < f?catum (15); Forte < f?rte (11);Ginocchio < gen?culum (16); Gengiva <g?ng?vam (19) Gomito < c?b?tum (18); Grasso <gr?ssum (10); Grida(lui) <crit?re/allocut?re(12); Odore < od?rem (11); Piede < p?dem (18);Ridere < r?d?re (16); Sopracciglia <superc?l?um(19); Sudore < sud?rem (17); Vedere < v?d?re(18); Voce < v?cem (16)Table 1.
Selected words from ALF and ALIAtlases.
In parentheses is the number ofderivations (states) for each selected worldWe selected 23 words from the ALF (Table 1),yielding a variable number of forms or phoneticchanges, representing the stressed vocalism of thedialects of O?l (short/long, high/mid/low vowels inopen and close syllabic context).2.2 Southern Italo-Romance (SIR).
We thenapplied the same type of cladistic analysis to thedialects of the dialectal area of Southern Italo-Romance.
We made use of the data relating to theconsonant system of these dialects, with ALI(Atlante Linguistico dell' Italia, 1995) as a source.In this case, 21 localities were sampled for thisanalysis, picking up three varieties for each maindialect of these areas (northern, central, andsouthern: 3 for Campanian, Basilian, Apulian,Calabrian, Sicilian and Salentinian, including alsothree varieties of Sardinian).
The lexical sampleamounts to 20 words (Table 1).3 Cladistic analysis3.1 Linguistic prolegomena.
From the quotedcorpora, diachronic trees were created using theexisting bibliography (Chauveau, 1989; Pignon,1960).
But we must reckon and point out that wehad a very hard time in trying to make sense out ofcontradictory or underspecified accounts on chainsof phonetic changes available in the literature.
Wefound out ?
to our bewilderment ?
that mostphonetic changes are quite often telescoped inhandbooks of Romance dialectology, monographs,and Ph.D. dissertations, giving only the first andthe last stage of phonetic changes: *A > D, insteadof *A > *B > *C > D. We therefore had to rely onprinciples of areologic continuity, as the process ofstepping is made hazardous by the vacuum on thesuccessive stages of the sound changes in theliterature, in particular in the peripheral varieties ofo?l (except in Chauveau?s monographs on westernO?l dialects).
These principles are the following:Pr.1.
Principle of areologic continuity: implies agradual theory of linguistic change whose stagescan be reconstructed on the basis of arealconfigurations.
It entails that stages *B and *C of a*A > D change are available on the maps in currentdialects not far from a contiguous centre of gravity.For instance, in western o?l dialects, *e > oi goesthrough a *e > ei > ai > oi vowel shift whose *aiphase is still to be seen on the ALF maps in theneighbourhood, but it is not akin with the fardistant *e > oi change in the East (in Romancelorrain), where the chain *e > ei >oi does not entailan *ai phase.Pr.2.
Principle of parsimony: it claims that thevocalic system develops with parsimony thestrategies of change; not more than two or threemajor structural options from which the laterevolutions unfold.Pr.3.
Principle of unitarianism and naturalness:dialectal idiosyncrasies should be rare upstreamand abundant downstream.
In other words, changeis strongly constrained typologically closer to theroot of the stepping tree, and gets more and more24free at the end of the branches.
One should becautious with the intricate complexity ofexplanations found in monographs and handbookson idiosyncrasy of changes in local dialects.
Moresimply, one could state that changes areconstrained according to UG (Universal Grammar)principles on the first hand, and specified by local,language or dialect-specific parameters on thesecond hand.3.2.
Cladistic procedure.
In order to applycladistic procedure to linguistic data, one has firstto find a way to code the trees of philologicalderivations through a coding procedure whichtakes into account all the hypotheses assumed bythe linguists.
In a second step, the fieldobservations have to be coded, and, finally, treebuilding algorithms are implemented to meetoptimal criteria, i.e.
parsimony in this context.However, within the framework of this necessarilyshort paper, we will only discuss tree structure,tackling briefly the feasible reconstruction ofancestral state at nodes, but keeping detaileddevelopment  for further presentation.3.2.1 Character codingFigure 1a shows how the relationships betweenvocalic variations of a given word (?P?re?, as anexample) are coded.
Each variant takes the value 0or 1 depending on its place within the treederivation.
First, a matrix is built (figure 1b),where rows stand for the coding of the variants,whereas columns hold for the transformations froma plesiomorphic variant (the initial diachronicstate, or etymon) to an apomorphic one (theterminal state, or synchronic reflexes).
Forexample, the inferred variant, *a?
(lettered A),derived from the late latin variant of the A[ 2variable, is coded by the vector [0000000], beingthe ancestral variant, while its derived reflexes areall coded 1, in the first column.
Likewise, theapomorphic variant ?:?
(lettered F) is coded by thevector [1001100], the first 1 indicates that thisvariant is derived from the ?
variant (B), and thefourth and fifth 1 indicate that it is also derivedsuccessively from ???
to ??:??
(B?>E) and from ??:??
to ?
?:??
(E?>F).2 A[ reads as classical latin low vowel in open syllableas in PA-TREM, MA-REM (noted < [ >, whereas < ] >stands for a closed syllabe as in ?AR- : AR-CUM, AR-TEM).

(a),its factorized (c) and matrix (d) representations.Each column in (b) corresponds to a change in thetree derivation.
The vector W allows a weightingof each shift (example of a 423433 weight-chain,values being expressed above each arrow, and inred colour).
The arrows indicate the orientation ofchanges.
Backward changes have an infinityweight.
The (c) matrix provides equivalentinformation, with i holding for infinity weight.
(b)and (c) representations are fitted for PHYLIP andPAUP respectively.Since the transformations can be estimated to bemore or less current in term of phonologicalnaturalness, they can be weighed by giving heavyweights for natural or rare transformations andlight weights for easy transformations.
In thiswork, character weight was ranged on a scalebetween 1 and 5 (e.g.
w [423433], figure 1).Lastly, since the transformations are polarized,meaning that we hypothesize the absence ofbackward changes, we allocate an infinite weightfor reversal transformation (i.e.
no reversionallowed).
This kind of coding is routinely used byphylogeneticists (see PHYLIP or PAUP software).All the derivation trees are available on request.253.2.2.
Data coding and tree reconstructionOnce the character coding step is performed forall the words investigated (23 different words forthe O?l data (ALF), 20 for SIR (ALI)), each area ordialect is coded according to the previous coding.In the example of the O?l investigation, data werecollected for 45 geographical different areas(figure 2), each of them having its own way topronounce each of the 23 words of the sample.
Forexample (Table 2), the row ?
16Bourg 3?
has thevariant C for the first word (?P?re?)
described onthe first column.
This means that this area as wellas the area numbered 45, 59, 65, and 143 share thesame derived variant: ???
(labelled C, figure 1),while the rows labelled 108 and 153 share the ??
:?reflex variant (B), variants that they inheritedeither from some common ancestor or because ofgeographical proximity.16Bourg     CGLCREJB?NIFFDDEDDDJBBF45FrCom     CBB?FGEEENCIGIDEDEFJBCF59LorrRom   CILEMJFBEOFFDCHEDEFEDEF65FrcomE    CAB?HGE?GNNGKIHEDEFB?BF108BerNE    BILCGCGEENTFGBECDDDJ?MF146Champ    CJNHQHLHE?JGGGGEADDF?GC153Lorr     BILCEHCCEHGJJHHEGEED?BDTable 2: Part of the data matrix from the ALFsample.
First column is ?P?re?
coding.Finally, each letter of this data matrix is replacedby its coding (figure 1b), as it has been done in theprevious step (character coding).
For instance theletter C, column 1 (figure 2) is replaced by thevector [1100000], the letter B by [1000000].
Thetree building reconstruction is carried out from thisfinal matrix which sums up all the linguistichypotheses (tree of philological derivation, polarityof changes, weighting, and geographic variants).Factorisation are performed with FACTORsoftware (Felsenstein, 2004), parsimonious treesbeing obtained with PAUP* (v4.0) (Swofford,2002), using TBR (tree-bisection-reconnection),random agglomeration option (100), holding 6 besttrees at each steps.
Tree length, consistency indexand retention index are also estimated.
The mostparsimonious trees are then plotted figures 3 and 4.An example of inferred parallelism is also shownon figure 3.
Once clades are well characterized, itbecomes possible to count the number ofparallelisms that are shared within each clade and3 Number refers to the ALF or ALI areasthose that are shared between clades, giving anestimation of the intensity of borrowing.SardinianCampanianApulianSalentinianBasilianCalabrianSicilianFigure 2: localization of the O?l and SIR dialectsamplings.
Contour lines (upper map) correspondto clades from the figure 3.4 Results4.1.
In the O?l dialects tree (figures 2 and 3), thecentral varieties appear as a clade (C1, from251Champagne NO to 478Noirmoutier, fuchsiaand yellow clades), which gathers the dialects ofthe Paris basin and those of the mid-west plains,and includes peripheral spots, like Noirmoutier(478) or Saintongeais (518Saintonge).
This majornode (Center-Western macro-area) makes up a unitof the great mid-west, having the subset Normano-Picardo-Gallo (C2 and C3) as a peripheral compactcore.
Opposite to this, a very consistent andgeographically gradual unit clustering the Franc-Comtois and the Walloon (C4, from 153Lorraine Sto 197Wallon O, green clade) varieties, in theEastern part of the macro-dialect network ofNorthern Gallo-Romance (i.e., o?l), together with26the Romance Lorraine 4  dialects.
In addition tothese great divisions between Central-Western o?land Peripheric Eastern o?l, which is fairlyconsistent with current classifications of o?ldialects (Goebl, 1984, 2002), the advantage of thistree lies in the consistency of the inner structuresof the major or intermediate clades.Table 3 gives the estimation of the number ofparallelisms and/or borrowings within and betweenclades.
Clearly the number of parallelism observedwithin each clades turns out to be more intensewithin than between clades.C1 C2 C3 C4C1: Fuchsia+Yellow 3.66 1.47 .084 1.19C2: Red 1.47 4.59 1.53 1.22C3: Blue 0.84 1.53 9.38 1.68C4: Green 1.19 1.22 1.68 6.19Table 3: Estimation of the number of parallelismsand/or borrowings within (diagonal) and betweenclades, standardized by the number of possibleexchanges.
Clades are defined as figure 3.4.2.
Concerning the Southern Italo-Romance(SIR), from Naples to Sicily and Sardinia, thecongruence between the cladistic tree (figure 4)and the philological classifications is satisfactory(Goebl, 1984; Grassi et al, 1997), and most ofnovelties lay in the inner structures of the tree.
Thephylogram of the SIR shows three major divisions(figure 4): two peripheries, the first one gatheringSardinian Central-Southerner varieties (786 and748) and the southernmost apulien (818) (redcluster), and the second one (fuchsia) grouping thecentral-northern apulian (846,828)) as an externalbranch with the southernmost basilian and centralsalentino (868 and 917) This last branch isconnected to an inner group which separates thebranch from Sicilian-Sardinian-Salentino (in blue)from the campano-calabro-basilian (green andyellow).
A most interesting detail is the place of818Apul, a Gallo-Romance francoproven?aldialect settled in two villages (Faeto and Celle) SanVito by the Angevine dynasty in Northern Apuliaduring the 13th century.
This dialect, previously4  As opposed to German Lorrain dialects (Lower-German type) spoken around Metz, whereas RomanceLorrain o?l dialects are or were spoken around Nancyand in the Vosges hills.spoken in the Ain and Is?re departments in France,got into close, symbiotic contact with Apulian, adialect of the SIR type.
The cladistic proceduregrasped accurately its allogenic structure,clustering it in the upper branch, along withSardinian ?
also a distinct language as compared toSIR- which should therefore considered as a?foreign languages branch?
rather than a periphericnode of the SIR continuum.5 DiscussionThe cladistic approach developed here provides aconvenient way to integrate and test varioushypotheses concerning the linguistic changes.Particularly, the rare or relative absence ofbackmutation in phonological characters iscorrectly taken into account by forbidden reversechanges, and complex relationships between statesof traits are easily handled, unlike most of the othermethods (as network approaches).
The parsimonycriterion consists to optimise the tree in minimisingparallelism.
The residual inferred parallelismscould clearly be visualized simply by looking atthe places they occur along the tree (as exemplifiedfigure 3).
A way to circumvent the parallelismproblem, when several parsimonious trees arefound, would be using a successive weightingprocess which looks for parsimonious trees byassigning to each trait a weight inverselyproportional to its degree of homoplasy (onlyparallelism in our case since reversion are notallowed) (Farris 1969).
No such a process wasnecessary with our dataset since only oneparsimonious tree was found.
However, therobustness of the parsimonious tree remainsdifficult to evaluate, as long as only few words areintegrated in our dataset (only 23 and 20 for Oiland SIR data respectively), particularly toappropriately implement resampling procedures(bootstrap or jackknife).At this stage of interpretation, one cannotdifferentiate between parallel development andborrowing, unless some a priori are introduced todo so.
In our data set, parallelisms are frequent(leading to a weak CI) although our twoparsimonious trees are unique and well resolved(actually, there is no simple relation between CIand tree resolution) preventing us using various2710251ChampagneNO227Seine-Oise226Seine202Berry C408Tour343NormandieC108Berry NE423AnjouE349NormandieSO446AnjouO16BourgogneC419PoitouC531PoitouS518Saintonge459PoitouNO478Noirmoutier283PicardieArtois N284PicardieArtois S289PicardieO298Artois Littoral N167ChampagneArdennes280PicardieE282PicardieNE286PicardieArtois C264PicardieS279PicardieLittoral S299Artois Littoral C394NormandieCotentinO471GalloN354NormandieC486GalloO65FrancheComt?E171LorraineE191WallonieE197WallonieOANCESTORfuchsiayellowredbluegreenB->C C->D = B->G E->F: : : :==changes386NormandieCotentinE153LorraineS154Lorraine romaneC164LorraineN146ChampagneSE45FrancheComt?C59LorraineromaneS174LorraineromaneN182WallonieS181LorraineRomaneNEFigure 3.

Retention index (RI) = 0.74; Rescaled consistency index (RC) = 0.21).Branch lengths are proportional to the number of changes.

(see also figure 2)network approaches5 (median network or medianjoining based on characters, definitively excludingneighbornet method which is based on globalresemblance and is in any way cladistic).
Theseapproaches are not able, as far as we know, tohandle large amount of polarized changes andcomplex weighted multistate relationships.
On theother hand, our strategy turns out to be quitedifferent from the one proposed by Nakhelh et al(2006) which first apply compatibility method toselect the best traits allowing to retain few treesconsidered as ?almost perfect phylogenies?
(missing the phylogenetic information brought bythe other traits), and then to parsimoniously handlethe remaining traits as possible edges representingborrowing, (but not giving the possibility ofmodifying the tree structure accordingly).
Anadditional advantage (only lightly evoked in thispaper) of the cladistic approach is to allowinferring changes of the traits along the tree,suggesting some linguistic scenarios, as correlatedchanges, borrowings ?5 See SPLITTREE and NETWORK packages in ref.6 ConclusionsWe shall conclude this pioneering cladistic surveyof phyla and dialect networks pointing out at threemain assets of our data processing : i) unlike mostof current and past research in taxonomy applied tolinguistic data, we tried to do much more thanmerely computing distance and similarity betweenlists of lexical cognates with a binary procedure:we processed data according to geolinguisticanalysis, using area linguistic procedures andphonological markedness theory in endowingweight to reflexes, ii) our results are mainlycongruent and consistent with currentclassification, but intricate patterns in the innerstructures of cladistic nodes also challenging theseclassifications, iii) In spite of the small number ofwords presently studied here, but thanks toaccurate data and proper sampling from the ALFand ALI database, it turns out that, by applyingcladistics, for long advocated by linguists, one canobtain consistent, reliable (and possibly refutable)results.
This is not always the case in theprocessing of fuzzy data and mere lists of words.29Linguists and cladisticians should therefore becautious about word-lists, and should as well relyon linguistic atlases, which provide the widestarray of sampling, and high quality data gatheredthrough fieldwork by highly trained professionals.In other words, to put it straightforwardly, wellmanaged empiricism is a sine qua non conditionfor reliable results in quantitative linguistics,especially as far as cladistics is concerned, due tothe powerfulness of the procedure.7 ReferencesALI, Atlante Linguistico Italiano.
