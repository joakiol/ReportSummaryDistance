A key supporting objective is to de-velop techniques for integration of CSR and naturallanguage processing (NLP) systems in SLS applica-tions.
The CSR techniques are based on a continuous-observation Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach.Efforts are focused on improved HMM training andrecognition for high performance and robustness inadvanced SLS environments which include variabil-ities due to spontaneous speech, noise, and task-induced stress.
Robustness i also being addressedthrough a new effort in comparison and developmentof auditory model front ends for HMM recognizers.The effort in CSR/NLP integration is focused on de-velopment of a structured CSR/NLP interface, whichwill allow effective collaboration with and betweenother groups developing NLP and/or CSR systems.BackgroundThe Lincoln program began with a focus onimproving speaker stress robustness for the fighteraircraft environment.
A robust HMM isolated-word recognition (IWR) system was developed with99% accuracy under stress conditions, representingmore than an order-of-magnitude r duction in er-ror rate relative to a baseline HMM system.
Arobust CSR system was then developed and inte-grated into a voice-controlled flight simulator - -  asimple, but complete SLS involving a stressing, real-time task.
The robust HMM recognition system wasthen adapted and extended to large vocabulary CSR.This effort has included development of a numberof new modeling and recognition techniques, includ-ing parameter models based on tied Gaussian mix-tures, which have resulted in state-of-the-art perfor-mance for both speaker-dependent (SD) and speaker-independent (SI) recognition on the DARPA Re-source Management (RM) database.Recent AccomplishmentsRecent accomplishments include: (1) develop-ment of a new adaptive training strategy, improvedsemiphone models, and an improved uration modelfor the tied-mixture HMM recognizer; (2) develop-ment and application of stochastic bigram backofflanguage models to obtain new results on both theresource management (RM) and the Air Travel In-formation System (ATIS) tasks; (3) modification ofthe recognizer to work with bigram backoff languagemodels; (4) conversion of a version of the HMM CSRto use a stack decoder controlled search with stochas-tic language models; and (5) development and imple-mentation of a structured CSR/NLP interface sys-tem, with CSR and NLP simulators, and delivery ofthe interface system software to several other sites inthe DARPA SLS community.PlansPlans for the current program include: (1)continued development of the tied-mixture HMMCSR system, including adaptive training techniques,mixture weight smoothing, and improved speaker-independent techniques; (2) further development ofthe stack-decoder-based HMM, for integration withthe CSR/NLP interface system and with NLP sys-tems developed at other sites; (3) a comprehensivecomparison of auditory model front ends in quiet,noise, and stress conditions, with the goal of develop-ing a more robust front end; and (4) participation inthe design of a new CSR corpus with larger vocabu-lary and higher perplexity than the RM corpus.417
