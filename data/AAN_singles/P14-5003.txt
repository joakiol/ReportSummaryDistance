Proceedings of 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: System Demonstrations, pages 13?18,Baltimore, Maryland USA, June 23-24, 2014.c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsOpen-Source Tools for Morphology, Lemmatization, POS Taggingand Named Entity RecognitionJana Strakov?a and Milan Straka and Jan Haji?cCharles University in PragueFaculty of Mathematics and PhysicsInstitute of Formal and Applied Linguistics{strakova,straka,hajic}@ufal.mff.cuni.czAbstractWe present two recently released open-source taggers: NameTag is a free soft-ware for named entity recognition (NER)which achieves state-of-the-art perfor-mance on Czech; MorphoDiTa (Morpho-logical Dictionary and Tagger) performsmorphological analysis (with lemmatiza-tion), morphological generation, taggingand tokenization with state-of-the-art re-sults for Czech and a throughput around10-200K words per second.
The taggerscan be trained for any language for whichannotated data exist, but they are specifi-cally designed to be efficient for inflectivelanguages, Both tools are free softwareunder LGPL license and are distributedalong with trained linguistic models whichare free for non-commercial use under theCC BY-NC-SA license.
The releases in-clude standalone tools, C++ libraries withJava, Python and Perl bindings and webservices.1 IntroductionMorphological analysis, part-of-speech taggingand named entity recognition are one of the mostimportant components of computational linguisticapplications.
They usually represent initial stepsof language processing.
It is no wonder then thatthey have received a great deal of attention in thecomputational linguistics community and in somerespect, these tasks can even be considered veryclose to being ?solved?.However, despite the fact that there is a consid-erable number of POS taggers available for En-glish and other languages with a large number ofactive users, we lacked a POS tagger and NE rec-ognizer which would?
be well suited and trainable for languageswith very rich morphology and thus a largetagset of possibly several thousand plausiblecombinations of morphologically related at-tribute values,?
provide excellent, preferably state-of-the-artresults for Czech,?
be distributed along with trained linguisticmodels for Czech,?
allow the user to train custom models for anylanguage,?
be extremely efficient in terms of RAM anddisc usage to be used commercially,?
offer a full end-to-end solution for users withlittle computational linguistics background,?
be distributed as a library without additionaldependencies,?

be open-source, free software.Following these requirements, we have devel-oped a morphological dictionary and tagger soft-ware, which is described and evaluated in Sec-tion 3; and a named entity recognizer, which is de-scribed and evaluated in Section 4.
The softwareperformance and resource usage are described inSection 5 and the release and licensing conditioninformation is given in Section 6.
We conclude thepaper in Section 7.2 Related Work2.1 POS TaggingIn English, the task of POS tagging has been inthe center of computational linguists?
attention fordecades (Kucera and Francis, 1967), with renewedinterest after significant improvements achievedby (Collins, 2002).
The recent state-of-the-art forEnglish POS supervised tagging without externaldata for training is by (Shen et al., 2007) and thereare many available taggers, such as well-knownBrill tagger (Brill, 1992), TnT tagger (Brants,2000) and many others.13In Czech, the POS tagging research has beencarried out mostly by Czech speaking linguisticcommunity and the current state-of-the-art was re-ported by (Spoustov?a et al., 2009) in Mor?ce re-search project1.
Based on this project, two taggerswere released: Mor?ce tagger (released as part ofCOMPOST2containing morphological analyzer,tagger and trained models, available to registeredusers only) and Featurama3(source code only, notrained models publicly available).2.2 Named Entity RecognitionFor English, many NE datasets and shared tasksexist, e.g.
CoNLL-2003 (Tjong Kim Sang andDe Meulder, 2003), MUC7 (Chinchor, 1998).These shared tasks and the associated freely avail-able NE annotated corpora allowed wide and suc-cessful research in NE recognition in English.
Forexample, the systems which published high scoreson the CoNLL-2003 task include (Suzuki andIsozaki, 2008), (Ando and Zhang, 2005) and to ourknowledge, the best currently known results onthis dataset were published by (Ratinov and Roth,2009).
One should also mention a well-known andwidely used Stanford parser (Finkel et al., 2005).In Czech, the referential corpus for NE recog-nition is called the Czech Named Entity Corpus4(?Sev?c?
?kov?a et al., 2007) and we describe its?
prop-erties further in Section 4.2.
The development ofthe Czech NE recognition research is easy to fol-low: started by a pilot project by (?Sev?c?
?kov?a et al.,2007), the results were improved by (Kravalov?aand?Zabokrtsk?y, 2009), (Konkol and Konop?
?k,2011) and (Konkol and Konop?
?k, 2013).
The cur-rent state-of-the-art results for CNEC are reportedby (Strakov?a et al., 2013).
So far, there was nofreely available Czech NE recognizer.3 MorphoDiTa: MorphologicalDictionary and Tagger3.1 Morphological Dictionary MethodologyThe morphological dictionary is specially de-signed for inflective languages with large numberof suffixes (endings) and we propose an effectivemethod for handling rich morphology.In inflective languages,5words take endings1http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/morce/index.php2http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/compost/3http://sourceforge.net/projects/featurama/4http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/cnec/5In the following, we describe features of a core groupof inflective languages, such as Slavic languages of all types.
(suffixes) to mark linguistic cases, grammaticalnumber, gender etc.
Therefore, many forms maybe related to one lemma.
For example, the lemma?zelen?y?
(?green?
in Czech) can appear as ?ze-len?y?, ?zelen?ej?s??
?, ?zelen?emu?
etc.
?
there areseveral tens of forms for this type of adjective.Corpus-wise, there are 168K unique forms and72K lemmas in a corpus of 2M words (Prague De-pendency Treebank 2.5 (Bej?cek et al., 2012)) inCzech.
It is therefore crucial to handle the end-ings effectively and to reduce the processing costswhere regularities are found.Given a resource with forms, lemmas and tags,6MorphoDiTa estimates regular patterns based oncommon form endings and automatically clustersthem into morphological ?templates?
withoutlinguistic knowledge about the language.
We nowdescribe the method for template set creation.During template set creation, MorphoDiTatakes lemmas one by one.
For each lemma, itcollects all corresponding forms and builds a trie(De La Briandais, 1959; Knuth, 1997).
Trie is atree structure in which one character correspondsto a node and all descendants of a node share thesame prefix.
The procedure then finds a suitablecommon ancestor in the trie (common prefix orstem).
The heuristics is ?such a node whose sub-tree has depth at most N and at the same time hasthe maximal number of ancestors with one child?.Intuitively, this means we want to select a longprefix (stem) ?
hence ?maximal number of ances-tors?
but at the same time, the linguistic endingsare not too long (at most N ).
Having selected acommon prefix, all the endings (including theircorresponding tags) in its subtree define a tem-plate.
A rich trie with many subtrees may be splitinto multiple templates.
For example, a simple triefor noun ?hrad?
(?castle?
in Czech) with one tem-plate, and also two lemmas sharing two templatesare shown in Fig.
1.
When processing the nextlemma and its corresponding forms, either newtemplate is created, or the templates are reused ifthe set of endings is the same.
Larger N leads tolonger endings and larger number of classes, andsmaller N leads to short endings and less classes.7Sometimes, the word ?inflective?
is used also for agglutina-tive languages such as Turkish, Hungarian or Finnish; we be-lieve our tools are suitable for these, too, but we have nottested them on this group yet.6In Czech, the resource used was Morfflex CZ by JanHaji?c: http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/morfflex.7Our morphological dictionary representation cannot bereplaced with a minimized finite state automaton with marked14The number of templates determines the effi-ciency of dictionary encoding.
When too few tem-plates are used, many are needed to represent alemma.
When too many are used, the representa-tion of the templates themselves is large.The morphological dictionary is then saved inbinary form and the software offers a higher levelaccess: given a form, morphological analysis listsall possible lemma-tag pairs; given a lemma-tagpair, MorphoDiTa generates the respective form.The analysis function is then used in tagging,which we describe in the next section.The heuristics described above does not requirelinguistic knowledge about the language and han-dles linguistic regularities very well.
The majoradvantage is a significant data compression lead-ing to efficient resource usage: in our setting, theoriginal morphology dictionary, the Czech Morf-flex, contains 120M form-tag pairs derived from1M unique lemmas, using 3 922 different tags, oftotal size 6.7GB.8Using the proposed heuristicswith N = 8, there are 7 080 templates created,such that the whole dictionary is encoded using3M template instances.
The resulting binary formof the dictionary uses 2MB, which is 3 000 timessmaller than the original dictionary.In order to look up a word form in the dictio-nary, we split it into a prefix and an ending forall ending lengths from 1 to N .
We then findtemplates associated with both the prefix and theending.
For each such template, we return thelemma corresponding to the prefix and the tag cor-responding to the ending.
The result is a set oflemma-tag pairs found during this procedure.
Thisalgorithm can be implemented efficiently ?
ourimplementation performs 500k word form lookupsper second in the Czech morphological dictionary.3.2 POS Tagger MethodologyThe POS tagger is an offspring of Mor?ce and Fea-turama research projects based on (Spoustov?a etal., 2009).
For each form in the text, the mor-phological dictionary suggests all possible lemma-tag candidates and these lemma-tag pairs are dis-ambiguated by the tagger.
The tagger is imple-mented as supervised, rich feature averaged per-ceptron (Collins, 2002) and the classification fea-tures are adopted from (Spoustov?a et al., 2009).lemmas, because the process of minimization cannot capturetemplates containing word forms (or their prefixes) of multi-ple lemmas.8Which compresses to 454MB using gzip -9.hrada e ?

(castle inCzech), and two lemmas sharing templates.Czech language was trained on the training partof the Prague Dependency Treebank 2.5 (Bej?ceket al., 2012).
The English language was trainedon the standard training portion (Sections 0-18) ofthe Wall Street Journal part of the Penn Treebank(Marcus et al., 1993).
In both cases, the systemwas tuned on the development set (Sections 19-21in PTB/WSJ in English) and tested on the testingsection (Sections 22-24 in PTB/WSJ in English).3.3 POS Tagger EvaluationAn evaluation of POS taggers, which do not useexternal data, is shown in Table 1 for Czech and inTable 2 for English.
MorphoDiTa reaches state-of-the-art results for Czech and nearly state-of-the-art results for English.
The results are very simi-lar for the three Czech systems, Mor?ce, Featuramaand MorphoDiTa, because in all three cases, theyare implementations of (Spoustov?a et al., 2009).However, MorphoDiTa is the first end-to-end ap-plication released under a free license.Due to rich morphosyntactic complexity of theCzech language and the positional tagging schemeproposed by (Haji?c, 2004), there are 3 922 plausi-ble tags in Czech (although only 1 571 unique tagsactually appear in training data).However, in many applications, only the firsttwo tagging positions, which correspond to POSand sub-POS,9are actually needed for further pro-cessing, which greatly reduces the complexity ofthe task, leaving only 67 possible tags (64 in train-ing data), although some morphological informa-tion, such as case, is lost.9Sub-POS is detailed set of POS labels, which includesbasic properties such as the type of pronouns, conjunctions,adjectives, also some tense and active/passive/mood informa-tion for verbs, etc.15Tagger Task AccuracyMor?ce tag 95.67%Featurama tag 95.66%MorphoDiTa tag 95.75%MorphoDiTa lemma 97.80%MorphoDiTa lemma+tag 95.03%MorphoDiTa tag-first two pos.

is?AAIS1----1A----?
and ?AA?, respectively.The first two positions are in fact quite similarto what the Penn-style tags encode (for English).MorphoDiTa therefore also offers models trainedon such a restricted tagging scheme.
The tag-ger evaluation for the 2-position, restricted tags isgiven in the last row of Table 1.4 NameTag: Named Entity Recognizer4.1 NER MethodologyThe NE recognizer is an implementation of a re-search project by (Strakov?a et al., 2013).
The rec-ognizer is based on a Maximum Entropy MarkovModel.
First, maximum entropy model predicts,for each word in a sentence, the full probabil-ity distribution of its classes and positions withrespect to an entity.
Consequently, a global op-timization via dynamic programming determinesthe optimal combination of classes and named en-tities chunks (lengths).
The classification featuresutilize morphological analysis, two-stage predic-tion, word clustering and gazetteers and are de-scribed in (Strakov?a et al., 2013).The recognizer is available either as a run-timeimplementation with trained linguistic models forCzech, or as a package which allows custom mod-els to be trained using any NE-annotated data.4.2 Czech Named Entity CorpusFor training the recognizer, Czech Named EntityCorpus(?Sev?c?
?kov?a et al., 2007) was used.
In thiscorpus, Czech entities are classified into a two-level hierarchy classification: a fine-grained setof 42 classes or a more coarse classification of 7SystemF-measure F-measure(42 classes) (7 classes)(?Sev?c?
?kov?a et al., 2007) 62.00 68.00(Kravalov?a et al., 2009) 68.00 71.00(Konkol and Konop?

Like other authors, we report theevaluation on both hierarchy levels.Czech Named Entity Corpus annotation allowsambiguous labels, that is, one entity can be labeledwith two classes; however, NameTag predicts ex-actly one label per named entity, just like the pre-vious work does (Strakov?a et al., 2013).Furthermore, CNEC also allows embeddedentities, which is also somewhat problematic.NameTag always predicts only the outer-most en-tity (the embedding entity), although it is penal-ized by the evaluation score which includes cor-rect prediction of the nested entities.4.3 NER EvaluationFor comparison with previous work, we report re-sults for the first version of the Czech Named En-tity Corpus (CNEC 1.1).
The linguistic modelsreleased with NameTag are trained on the mostcurrent version of the Czech Named Entity Cor-pus (CNEC 2.0), which has been recently released.We report our results for both CNEC 1.1 andCNEC 2.0 in Table 3.5 Software PerformanceWe designed MorphoDiTa and NameTag as light-weight, efficient software with low resource usage.Depending on the morphosyntactic complexityof the language and the selected tagging scheme,the MorphoDiTa tagger has a throughput around10-200K words per second on 2.9GHz Pentiumcomputer with 4GB RAM.
Table 4 shows the sys-tem word throughput, allocated RAM and modelsize on such a machine for NameTag and Table 5shows these parameters for MorphoDiTa.16Task System Words / sec RAM Model sizeCzech tag Mor?ce (Spoustov?a et al., 2009) 1K 902MB 178MBCzech tag Featurama 2K 747MB 210MBCzech tag MorphoDiTa 10K 52MB 16MBCzech tag?first two pos.

BothMorphoDiTa and NameTag can be used as:?
a standalone tool,?
C++ library with Java, Python, Perl bindings,?
a web service, which does not require any in-stallation at the user?s machine whatsoever,?
an on-line demo.MorphoDiTa and NameTag are platform inde-pendent and do not require any additional libraries.Web services and demo for the Czech and Englishlanguages are also available.Table 6 lists the web links to all resources.
Thepre-compiled binaries and source code are avail-able on GitHub, the language models are avail-able from the LINDAT/CLARIN infrastructureand the documentation can be found at the respec-tive project websites.7 ConclusionWe released two efficient, light-weight POS- andNE taggers (especially efficient for inflective lan-guages), which are available to a wide audienceas an open-source, free software with rich APIand also as an end-to-end application.
The tag-gers reach state-of-the-art results for Czech andare distributed with the models.
We are currentlyworking on more language releases (Slovak, Pol-ish and Arabic).
We are also aware that the cre-ation of the dictionary relies on the existence of aresource annotated with forms, lemmas and tags,which may not be readily available.
Therefore,our future work includes developing a guesser foranalyzing previously unseen but valid word formsin inflective languages, using only data annotatedwith disambiguated POS tags.
We hope the releasefor Czech will prove useful for broad audience, forexample for shared tasks which include Czech lan-guage data.AcknowledgmentsThis work has been partially supported and hasbeen using language resources developed and/orstored and/or distributed by the LINDAT/CLARINproject of the Ministry of Education of the CzechRepublic (project LM2010013).
