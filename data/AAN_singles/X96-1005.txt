ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEWTIPSTER SE/CMtipster@fipster.orgTHE TIPSTER ARCHITECTUREThe TIPSTER Architecture is a softwarearchitecture for providing Document Detection (i.e.Document Retrieval and Message Routing) andInformation Extraction functions to text handlingapplications.
The high level architecture is describedin the Architecture Design Document.PURPOSE OF THE ARCHITECTUREThe TIPSTER Architecture is intended tofacilitate the deployment into the workplace ofadvanced Document Detection and InformationExtraction software.
It provides a component andmodule design which has been jointly developed by asignificant number of providers of advanced softwareof this type.
In addition, this design meets therequirements of a number of US Governmentagencies.The Architecture was developed to meet he needfor US Government agencies with similar texthandling requirements to share some softwaremodules and knowledge sources that meet theserequirements.
Use of the Architecture for Governmentprocurements will also shorten the developmentprocess for new text handling applications, because abasis for design would already exist and beunderstood by vendor and customer alike.
Finally,the Architecture will allow systems to be upgraded ina modular fashion as new text handling technologybecomes available.
Similarly, the researchcommunity can take advantage of the Architecture tofacilitate the testing of new ideas in advanced texthandling.SCOPE OF THE ARCHITECTUREThe Architecture has been designed to meet alarge number of text handling requirements for CIA,DIA, and NSA.
It meets, however, only thoserequirements having to do with Document Detectionand Information Extraction functions.
Mostrequirements for other functions, such as MachineTranslation or Optical Character Recognition must bemet outside the TIPSTER Architecture.

Inaddition, User Interface (GUI) requirements are notcovered by the Architecture, but, are unique to thespecific application.
Analytical tools, such as linkanalysis tools, timelines, or other displays showingdocument clustering are considered part of the UserInterface or the application.
These tools lie outsidethe Architecture, but use information about documentrelevancy, relationships between documents, phraselists, name lists, and relational or object data baserecords which has been exported by the functionalityresiding within the TIPSTER Architecture.ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTSThere are four components: Detection,Extraction, Annotation, and Document Management.i" Detection encompasses the technologywhich does document retrieval anddocument or message routing.Extraction encompasses the technologywhich identifies specific entities and therelationships between entities in free text sothey can be use to build a database.Annotation allows these two components oshare information at a component level.Primarily, at present, it is the method forrecording and passing forward theinformation developed by the Extractioncomponent.
Items of specific types, such aspersonal names, places, or organizationnames, for example, can be located in thetext by appropriate annotators, and the textlocations and data types can be passed toany other component or part of theapplication, through Annotations, for fiwtherprocessing or viewing.The Document Management componenthandles the document storage and archive.This function can be performed by existingdocument managers or Commercial off theShelf (COTS) products, such as a standardData Base Management System (DBMS),with the addition of a wrapper to becompatible with the TIPSTER Architecture.The TIPSTER Architecture is explained in moredetail in the "TIPSTER Text Phase II ArchitectureConcept" in this volume.34
