n t r o d u c t i o nThis paver describes a computer model of s~stsmic grammar, aprammar for n a t u r a l  languages developed by H a l l i d a y  andcolleagues at Univers i tv  College, London (Hal l iday , 1961, 197fl).Svstemic grammar has recentlv been o f  i n t e r e s t  t o  comoutationalgrammarians, arimarily as a result of the imn~essive work .ofWinograd.
( 1972 ) , who develoaed a natural l a n p u a ~ e  understandinpsystem one component o f  which was s t r o n g l v  influenced bv the~ r i n c i p l e s  of systemic grammar.
More recently, Power (1974) hasa l s o  investigated how svstemic pramnar can be used t o  ,analvsenatural language.
There have,  however, been no attempts to use acomputer to invest i .gate systemic grammar itself.
As Friedman(1971) says, in introducing her computer model oftransformational grammar, adequate n a t u r a l  lanquage grammars arebound to be so complex t h a t  some mechanical a i d  in investigatingtheir ~ r o ~ e r t i e s  will be mandatory.The a ims ,  t h e n ,  of d e v e l o ~ i n g  a computer model  of svstericprammar are threefold.
First, t h e  model enables  the  Rrammar tobe t e s t e d ,  i .
e .
it enables contradictions, amhip,uities andincomnletenesses  i n  the grammas to be found.
Pecondlv ,  t h e  modelenables systemic grammar i t s e l f  to he imnroved, s lnce t h econsequences of a d f u s t i n p  parameters and rules can be more e a s i l vfollowed.

An item's structure i s  defined by i t s  immediateconstituents ' functions and the sequence i n  which they occur,~ i v e n  all the features that  an item has, tKe i tem'sstructure may be determined, according to systemic hnammar, bythe sequential  application of rules of four kinds :(1)  feature-realisation rulesIn the simplest case, these rules a r e  of the form "if itemhas feature x then i t s  structure w i l l  contain function yv - y issaid t o  be the rea l i sa t ion  p f  x .
Some rules ape conditional i nthat the r e a l i s ~ t i o n  only holds i f  certain o the r  features are orare not present.
Also,  some rules  specify that  tktb functionsmust be conflated, i .

bath functions apply t o  the same immediateconstituent.
(Further de ta i l s  of these an?
the fo l lowing  rulesape given later when the program i s  d i s c u s s e d . )
The applicationof the feature-realisation rules provides  an unordered s o t  offunct ions ,  some o f  which may be conf la ted .
( 2 )  structure-buildinp rulesThese rules expand and arder th?a set of fwnctions to providethe structure of the item.
Structure-building rules are themselvesof four k i n d s ,  which i n  the  simplest case are of the following form:(-a) a d d i t i o n  rule3: "if funct ion y (or some combination offunct ions)  i s  present, then so must be function z (oassiblyconflated with other Functions 1".
(b) conflation rules: "if some condition expressed i n  terms- ~of functions is satisfied then some function must be conflatedwith cer ta in  other functions".
( c )  sequence rules: "if two functicns y and z are  resentthen y must be canflated with, orecede o r  not  follow z" .
(d l  compatibility rules: "functiops v and z must not beconf lated" .Addition and conflation rules are onlv applicable  i f  the resultantstructure does not  conflict with a sequence or coma t ib i l i t y  rule.Structure-building rules are no t  extrinsically ordered in any wav.After applying these rules, we have a complete.
specification ofthe item's atructum , i n  that  we have spec i f i ed  function-"bundlesw, each of which consists of the funct ions of one sf ?heimmediate constituents of the i t e m .
( 3 function-realisation rulesThese rules specify  which features are implied bv an item'sfunctions.
They are of the form "if a structure containsfunction y the  corresponding item must have feature x l ' .
Appliedto the function-bundles obtained from (21, these rules h e l p  todetermine the features possessed by the immediate constituents.
( 4) systemsSystem networks spec i fy  which features are implied by otherf e a t u r e s .
These networks are equivalent  to rules of the form"if feature x is present then so is one (or a l l )  of a s e t  offeatures, and conversely".
These rules expand a s e t  of feature$(possibly t h e  result of applying ( 3 )  , n o t  necessarily i n t o  acomplete set, since some f e a t u r e s  mav be freely selected.

SUIJJECT 1( =  !COPULAR IPROCEGS)( =  !POST-VERB !ATTRIBUTE)4 Conclusion' h e  obvious canelusion - that the mechanics of svstemicgrammar (as described by Hudson) are su f f i c i en t l y  well-definedto form the basis of a computer vodel - is, f o r  l i n g u i s t i cdescriptions , a s ign i f i can t  one.
However, the program alsodemonstratks that  some pule-descriptions require c l a r i f  ieation .For examle, feature-realisation and function-realisation rulesare impI i c i t l y  unordered (since features and functions areunordered) , m, more precisely,  the rules are to be consideredto apply simultaneously.
This  causes problems wi th  those ruleswhich prevent features being introduced (e.g.
rules such asFeat-ure-realisation rule 32, which means "if !SUBLTECT is ~resentthe realisation 1s as stated,  otherwise the first function, i .e .
!ACTOR, must not be introduced by any other  feature-realis ationrulew).
The solution seems to  be to reapply the  rules,recursively, until a structura is produced which is combatiblewith a l l  the rules.More seriously, the expectatiop tha t  the structure obtainedis independent of the order of a ~ p l i c a t i o n  of structure-buildingrules is not realised, a t  least  for t h e  grammar specified.
Polrexample, considering t+re second of the above generations andapplying rules SQ 1, SQ 2, ADDN 2 ,  SO 1, ADDN 1 (in t h a t  order)to the s e t  of functions obtained by t he  feature-realisationrules, we generate3!PIG-SUBJECT!

Clearly, either the grammarrequires modification or i t  does matrer which order thes tructure-bailding rules are applied.
