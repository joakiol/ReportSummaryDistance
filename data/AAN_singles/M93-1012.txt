(LSI) believes that the best system for producing a complete and accurate automate danalysis of natural language text is an in-depth text understanding system that employs linguistic as wel las other analytical techniques to interpret the text .
Our DBG (Data Base Generation) natural languageprocessing system performs full-scale linguistic analysis of text in order to produce a system-internal text-level representation of the content of the text .
This representation is composed of a set of entity and eventframe structures, interrelated to reflect the organization and content of the text .
This representation ofthe text can then be mapped into any data structure required by a downstream application, such as th etemplates specified for the MUC-5/Tipster applications.
DBG has been designed as a single core syste mfor handling texts of different types in different domains for a variety of applications .
Application typesfor which DBG has provided the input include information extraction and database generation tasks suc has MUC-5, message fusion (the combination of information derived from various kinds of sources, includin gtext ; see [1]), and the translation of text into another language using spoken input and output ([2]) .It is clear to us that our DBG system, while achieving MUC-5 results comparable to EME scores attaine dby Tipster contractors in the MUC-5 tests, is still far from achieving the level of performance that we believ eis possible for it .
LSI 's official MUC-5 P&R score for English Microelectronics (EME) texts was 42 .74, whichrepresents a considerable improvement over our MUC-4 P&R score of 18 .87 on TST3 .
As we continue toincorporate improved versions of the various components of our natural language processing system (Figure 1 )and to exploit more fully the capabilities of existing components, we expect that our scores will continue t oimprove .Founded upon research performed over the last twenty years, the DBG system has been under actua ldevelopment for the last seven years .
The basic architecture of the core system has remained the same ove rthat time.
Because the system is modular, the individual modules can be redesigned and updated withoutaffecting the rest of the system .
Most of the current modules have been redesigned or extended within th elast three years .1 Support for MUC-5 final testing was provided by the Army Research Laboratory/SLCBR-SE-C, under Contract No .DAAA15-89-C-0004 (Subcontract No.
05-562-01 to Logicon, Inc .)
Also, we gratefully acknowledge the assistance of AndrewBrislen and Michael Possedi from Sun Microsystems, and Carrie Du Bois from Quintus, during the final testing period.121a)0)a )C Yo u)as122INNOVATIVE ASPECTS OF THE SYSTE MAmong the innovative aspects of the DBG system as used for MUC-5 are a flexible frame-based concep thierarchy that is accessible at every stage of processing ; a principle-based syntactic parser which enables th eidentification of sentence-level event-entity relations very early in processing ; an integrated ability to handl eincomplete information and structures ; and the frame-based text-level representation mentioned above whic hallows for intersentential reference resolution and for the explicit representation of the event-entity relation sand implicit content of the text .
These relations were then easily mapped into EME templates .LSI's main area of development for MUC-5 was the extension of the knowledge contained in the concep thierarchy and the use of this knowledge at every stage of processing.
Although the frame-based hierarchywas a component of the DBG system as early as MUCK-2, it was not exploited significantly until MUC-5 .This, more than any other factor, was responsible for the increase in our performance over MUC-4 .
Eachitem in the lexicon is associated with a concept frame, as illustrated in Figure 2 .
The frames or concept node sbear " isa" (set membership) relations to other concepts in the hierarchy .
During lexical analysis, the lexicalitems in the text are linked to concepts in the hierarchy .
These concept links then provide the framewor kfor producing the set of instantiated concept frames and links (the frame-based text-level representation )which is the final output of internal DBG processing .
The frame-based concept hierarchy also allows fo rsemantic checking at any point in processing and provides a mechanism for the inheritance of features an dother information to direct descendants in the hierarchy.A related innovative DBG component is the Word Acquisition Module (WAM), which uses morphologica lanalysis to provide grammatical category information for words for which no lexical entry exists .
Based o nthe category assignment, a lexical entry and an "isa" link to a concept frame are automatically generatedfor each unknown item to allow complete processing of all sentences containing unknown words .The DBG syntactic parser as implemented for MUC-5 has a number of innovative aspects .
The parser isto a great extent language-independent ; it produces structures which reflect the partial isomorphism holdingbetween syntactic and semantic structures in order to increase accuracy of processing .
While the goal is toproduce complete parses, the parser is also robust enough to produce usable partial parses in the absence o fa complete parse .The design of the LSI parser is based on the Government-Binding theory of syntax .
It is essentiall ya head-driven parser, and includes both bottom-up and expectation-based aspects .
Argument structuresassociated with lexical items are projected into the syntax.
Syntactic structure is determined from bothitem-specific lexical requirements as well as general requirements on syntactic structures (e .g ., all sentencesin languages like English require a subject) .
The use of empty categories and syntactic chains, combine dwith knowledge of event types contained in the concept hierarchy, enables the parser to associate themati croles with entities expressed in noun phrases in a variety of construction types correctly and in a relativel ystraightforward manner .
Constructions which are usually assumed to include empty categories (i .e ., pho-netically null syntactic elements) include passives, embedded infinitival sentences, questions, and relativeclauses .
The rationale for this assumption is that in constructions of this type, words (usually verbs) whic htypically require either an external argument (an argument in the specifier position), or an internal argumen t(an argument in complement position) appear with no appropriate argument in one of these positions .
Sincesyntactic structures are characterized as "projections" of lexical items, these positions are assumed to b elatently present, and linked to a phonetically realized argument in some other position via coindexing .
Thephonetically realized argument and the empty category thus form a syntactic "chain" .
By using these chains ,we can associate the usual thematic roles assigned to certain positions with a given overt noun phrase, evenif the overt phrase is not in the usual position .
So adherence to certain grammatical principles in conjunctio nwith a well-engineered event knowledge base has enabled us to get something "for free", as it were, in th eMUC-5 task .Several of the innovative aspects of the DBG frame-based text-level knowledge representation, whichwe will here call the LSI templates (as distinct from the MUC-5 application-oriented EME templates )were not used extensively for MUC-5 .
These include the ability to combine contextual information ?
e .g .

with information extracted from the text ; thecapability of interpreting degree-of-belief information and relating it to meta-levels of event structure ; andthe incorporation of text grammar expectations as to the form and location of information within the text .Although these aspects of DBG are important in processing written and even transcribed voice messages i nthe Air Force and Army messages to which the system has been applied, the MUC-5 application does no tdepend heavily on outside information, and is not concerned with evaluation of the information received ,and is characterized by more variability in information structure across texts .The relational organization of the DBG event and entity templates, however, was extremely useful i nMUC-5 processing .
Because it resembles the object-oriented organizational structure of the EME templates ,the generation of EME template relations was relatively straightforward .
Also, the thematic roles of th eentity templates in relation to the events is explicit in the LSI templates and so can be easily associate dwith the role-specific slots (e .g ., manufacturer, distributor) in the EME templates .
In addition, the abilityto establish co-reference at the text level in the LSI templates prevents overgeneration of EME template sand facilitates the correct template linkage .In the next section, the basic processing is described and illustrated by an example sentence .. SYSTEM MODULES AND PROCESSING STAGE SBecause the DBG system modules and the processing of text have been previously described in detail ([3] ,[4]), we will here present only a brief summary of processing and then show a short example sentence toillustrate the innovative aspects of our system discussed in the previous section .The basic components of the DBG system are shown in the system diagram in Figure 1 .
They are thepreprocessing module, the lexical analysis module, the syntactic parse module, the semantic parse module ,and the knowledge representation module.
An additional module, the application interface, maps the ex-tracted knowledge into appropriate data structures according to the requirements of a given downstrea mapplication.
Processing is sequential?the output of each module is a data structure that serves as input to th esucceeding module and is then available to all later modules .
Each module contains a processing mechanismand a knowledge base that includes general as well as domain-sensitive knowledge .
The respective knowledg ebases, indicated in ovals, are the lexicon and morphological rules, the set of grammatical principles used t oconstruct the syntactic parse trees, the concept hierarchy, the discourse rules, and the rules for mapping int oexternal data structures .
As described in the previous section, at the stage of lexical analysis, the lexica litems in the text are linked to nodes in the concept hierarchy, which enables information derived from theconcept hierarchy to be used at any point in processing .
Sample lexical items are shown in Figure 2 .In addition to the basic components, the DBG system has an Unexpected Inputs (UX) Subsystem tha thandles new or erroneous data and evaluates and records system performance .
This subsystem consists ofmodules that are integrated into the system modules ; they are shown in the system diagram as small boxesinside the larger modules to which they apply.
The two UX modules of the DBG system that were use dfor MUC-5 are the Lexical Unexpected Inputs (LUX) module and the Word Acquisition Module (WAM) ,both of which apply at the Lexical Analysis stage .
The LUX module corrects errors by attempting partia lmatches between unmatched words in the text and items in the lexicon, using rules based on certain erro rhypotheses .
As mentioned previously, new or unidentified words are passed on to WAM, wherein word clas sinformation is assigned based on morphological analysis .To illustrate the processing, the lexical analysis, syntactic parse, and semantic parse for an exampl esentence are shown in Figure 3, and the LSI internal templates for the same sentence, are shown in Figure 4 .The sentence used is the first sentence of the example text 2606871, i .e ., "Hampshire Instruments has sol dan x-ray lithography system to AT&T Bell Laboratories .
"The syntactic parse is created by projecting lexical items into elementary phrasal trees, which are the nlinked according to subcategorization and selectional requirements, as well as general principles of grammar .125TEXT OF EXAMPLE SENTENC EHampshire Instruments has sold an x-ray lithography system to AT&T Bel lLaboratorie sLEXICAL ANALYSIS OF EXAMPLE SENTENC E1lxi(noun,'Hampshire Instruments','Hampshire Instruments',[],[],[],[] ,[ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [hampshireinstruments inc] )2lxi(aux,has,has, [perf], [p(3),n(s)], [T, [], [xp('-agr','+past') ] ,['+agr','-past'], [], [has] )lxi (third Ares, has, have, [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [strict (np) ] , [ ' +agr' , ' -past' ] , [ ] ,[have] )3lxi (past, sold, sell, [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [strict (np, bi_np (to) , np_prpt) ] ,['+agr','+past'],[],[sell] )lxi (pastpart, sold, sell, [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [strict (np, bi_np (to) , np_prpt) ] ,['-agr','+ ast'],[],[sell] )4lxi(det,an,an, []p , [], [], [], [strict (gp,ap,np)], [], [], [an] )5lxi(noun,'x-ray','x-ray', [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [x_ray] )6lxi (noun, 'lithography system', 'lithography system' , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] ,[],[lithography_system] )7lxi(prep,to,to,[], [strict (argp) ], [], [], [to] )lxi(to,to,to, [l, [], [], [], [l, [], [], [to] )8lxi(noun,'AT&T Bell Laboratories','AT&T BellLaboratories', [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [a_t_and t bell_labs] )SYNTACTIC PARSE OF EXAMPLE SENTENC E'Cmaxl' :Cmax(Cbar(C ,Imax(Nmax(Nbar(N(['Hampshire Instruments') :noun))) ,Ibar (I (+agr ,-past) ,Aspmax(Aspbar(Aux([has] :aux) ,Vmax(Vbar(Vbar(V([sold] :pastpart) ,Dmax(Dbar(D([an] :det) ,Nmax(Nbar(N(( x-ray'] : noun) ,Nmax(Nbar(N(['lithography system'] :noun)))))))) ,Pmax(Pbar(P([to] :prep) ,Nmax(Nbar(N(['AT&T Bell Laboratories'] :noun))))))))))))) .SEMANTIC PARSE OF EXAMPLE SENTENCEfpl :'MAINPRED'('1 .0') _ 'INDEX'('1 .1' )'SUBJECT/AGENT'('1 .1') = 'INDEX'('1 .2' )'NOUN/HAMPSHIRE INSTRUMENTS INC'= 'Hampshire Instruments ''TENSE'('1 .1') _ 'PRESENT PERFECT ''VOICE'('1 .1') = 'ACTIVE ''PREDICATE/SELL'('1 .1') = sel l'OBJECT/PATIENT'('1 .1') = 'INDEX'('1 .3' )'DETERMINER'('1 .3') = an'NOUN QUALIFIER/X RAY'('1 .3') = 'x-ray ''NOUN/LITHOGRAPHY SYSTEM'('1 .3') = 'lithography system ''PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE/RECIPIENT'('1 .1') = 'INDEX'('1 .4' )'PREPOSITION'('1 .4') = to'PREP OBJECT'('1 .4') = 'INDEX'('1 .5' )'NOUN/A T AND T BELL LABS'('1 .5') _ 'AT&T Bell Laboratories 'Figure 3: DBG Analysis of Sample Sentence126Among the principles which are most important in the current version of the parser are the projectio nprinciple, which constrains which positions in the tree can be assigned thematic roles, the extended projectio nprinciple, which attempts to link every clause to a subject, trace theory and the theta-criterion, which ensur ethat every argument position has a one-to-one correspondence with a theta-role, and X-bar theory, whic hlimits branching to binary structures following the X-bar schema .
Structural characteristics of the tree arethen matched with the thematic specifications of the lexical items heading the phrases in the tree .In the semantic parse, shown in Figure 3, the thematic roles are explicitly labeled and related by indice sto the verb `sell' .
The AGENT is `Hampshire Instruments', the PATIENT is `an x-ray lithography system' ,and the RECIPIENT is `AT&T Bell Laboratories' .
Other information, including the tense and voice o fthe verb, is also given .
Before a noun phrase can be assigned a given thematic role, it has to qualify bothsyntactically and by meeting semantic categorial requirements .
This is established through checking the th elink into the concept hierarchy of the head noun of the noun phrase and matching it with the selectiona linformation for the verb in the lexicon .
All of this is done at the sentence level .
Information from thesemantic parses of the text is then used to generate and instantiate the LSI templates .The frame-based text-level data structures (LSI templates) for a text are generated on the basis of th esemantic parse of that text and the frame information associated with the lexical items in the semantic parse .There are three major steps in LSI template generation : 1) the first pass, in which templates for specifie devents and the related entity templates are generated ; 2) the second pass, in which entity templates aregenerated for MUC-5 relevant words that are not treated in the first pass ; and 3) template linking, in whichco-reference relations are determined .An event template includes a set of empty slots which represent the various thematic roles associated wit hthe event .
The processing goal is to fill the thematic role slots of each of the event templates with a referenc eto an entity template .
The slots for event and entity templates are pre-defined in our concept hierarchy .For MUC-5, the following event-related thematic roles were handled : agent, patient, experiencer, recipient ,beneficiary, source, and location .
For example, while attempting to fill the slots of a manufacture event, as i n"Sony manufactured a new DRAM " , "Sony" will trigger an agent template, and "a new DRAM" will trigger apatient template .
The entity template has a pointer to the semantic parse node which triggered it .
The slot sof an entity template are determined by the entity type.
For MUC-5, all the entity templates have at leas tthe following slots : name, type, quantity, definiteness .
Different types of entities have different additiona lslots representing the relevant attributes for the given type of entity .
For example, company entities will alsohave the slots for location and nationality; equipment entities have slots for model, manufacturer, and wafersize ; and so on.
A few attributes such as location and granularity are themselves represented by templates .In the rule set for filling template slots, a rule is associated with a given slot .
The rules make use ofthe indexed relational structure of the semantic parse, as well as the frame information associated with th erelevant lexical item.
For example, to fill the agent slot of an event template, a semantic parse node which i sco-indexed with the event verb, and which is labeled "AGENT" is required .
Similarly for patient, recipient ,and others .During the second pass, all the important MUC-5 words (specific processes, company names, equipment ,devices) which were not handled in the first pass are processed, and each triggers an entity template .
Thefilling of templates is carried out in the same way as in the first pass .After all the templates are filled, co-reference links among the entity templates are established .
Therules used for MUC-5 were extremely simple and applied only to definite NPs, using the precedence of th eentity templates and compatibility of semantic features to determine co-reference .
In the next version of thi scomponent, a focus list will track each of the entities in the discourse to facilitate reference resolution .In the templates for the example sentence, shown in Figure 4, all the relevant entities are handled durin gthe first pass .
"Sell" is identified as a critical EME domain verb and an event template is generated for it ,with a set of theta role slots (agent, patient, recipient) to be filled .
Template rules identified "Hampshir eInstrument" as the agent, since it has the AGENT theta role label in the semantic parse (Figure 3) .

The template rules identified "x-ray lithographysystem" as the patient, since it has the PATIENT theta role label in the semantic parse .
The PATIEN Ttheta role label was derived from the fact that this noun phrase was identified as the direct object of a verbwhose internal argument is PATIENT .
An entity template is also generated for it, with slots to be filled .
"AT&T Bell Laboratories" is determined as the RECIPIENT since it is the object of the preposition "to "(indirect object marker), and its semantic features qualify it as a recipient for the given verb .
An entitytemplate is generated for it, also with slots to be filled .
The fills for the slots or attributes are derived byrules which utilize syntactic and semantic information about the noun phrase constituents .Co-reference resolution occurs next .
"Lithography system" cannot be co-referent with "Hampshire In-struments" since they belong to different semantic classes, as we know from the frames ; "AT&T Bell Labo-ratories" cannot co-refer with "Hampshire Instrument s" since they refer to different specific entities .
(If thethird entity were "the company," however, instead of "AT&T Bell Laboratories", it would be considered a sa possible co-referent of "Hampshire Instruments") .WALKTHROUGH TEXTThe sample walkthrough text shows both strengths and weaknesses of our approach and of the DBG syste mas it has been implemented so far .
As the last row of scores in Figure 5 shows, DBG scored quite well on thi stext, with a 79 .25% P&R score.
On closer examination, however, the performance of some of the individualmodules is somewhat disappointing.
For the walkthrough sample, the semantic parse of the first sentenceis shown in Figure 6 and the DBG templates are shown in Figure 7 .
The LSI EME output templates ar eshown in Figure 8 .In the LSI template generation for the walkthrough text, during the first pass two critical EME domai nverbs are identified : "use" and "sell", Event templates are generated for them with a set of theta role slot s(agent, patient, etc .)
to be filled .
For "use", for example, "the stepper" was identified as the agent of th epredicate, since it has a co-indexed AGENT theta role label in the semantic parse .
An entity templateis generated for it with slots to be filled .
Template rules for determining the patient identified "excimerlaser" as the patient, since it has the PATIENT theta role label in the semantic parse .
An entity templateis also generated for it .
To determine whether an attribute template should be generated for granularity ,the sentence in which "excimer laser" occurred is searched for words indicating units of granularity such a s"micron" , "nm", and if the search is successful, the previous co-indexed word indicating size is selected to fil lthe gran-size slot .MUC-5 relevant entities not identified during the first pass are handled during the second pass .
These are :"Nikon Corp", "NSR-1755EX8A " , "a new stepper", "64-Mbit DRAMS" , "a light source " , " the company" ,"latest stepper", "Nikon", "the excimer laser", "stepper", "system" .An entity template is produced for each of these entities, with a set of attribute slots to be filled for th eentity.
The size slot of "DRAMs" is derived from the co-indexed size unit word and the previous numera l("64-Mbit"), and the granularity slot of "latest stepper" is filled with "0 .5 micron" by the above rules .
Ina more recently updated version of DBG, the module slot for equipment can be filled .
So for "excimer lase rstepper" , the module slot for "stepper" has a pointer to the excimer laser template, based on the fact that a )"excimer laser" modifies "stepper", and b) the two have a part-whole relationship in the concept hierarchy .During the template linking phase, all of the templates referring to Nikon Corp ("Nikon Corp", "th ecompany" , "Nikon", " the company " ) are linked correctly.
This is done by searching through the entitiesmentioned in the previous discourse and checking for semantic compatibility.
The "NSR-1755EX8A" tem-plate did not get properly linked because appositives were not handled in this version of the system ; however"a new stepper" and "the stepper" are linked together correctly .
Moreover, "the latest stepper" did not ge tlinked to the previous stepper templates, which is correct since it they do not co-refer .
On the other hand ,"(the excimer laser) stepper" in the third sentence of the text, was incorrectly linked to "the latest stepper"129Official Scores for MUC-5 EME Final Tes t71603115.7582.7923345842 .748 9Unofficial Scores for EME Walkthrough Message (Run on system used for Final Test )3428120.3667.3793728879 .25100ERRUNDOVGSUBMinEMaxERECPREP&R TFFigure 5 : Summary of LSI MUC-5 Score sfpl :'DESCRIPTION'('1 .0') = 'INDEX'('1 .1' )'PREPOSITION'('1 .1') = in'PREP OBJECT'('1 .1') = 'INDEX'('1 .2' )'DETERMINER'('1 .2') = the'PARTIAL PARSE'('1 .1') = 'INDEX'('1 .3' )'NOUN/*SECOND*'('1 .3') = second'PARTIAL PARSE'('1 .3') = 'INDEX'('1 .4' )'NOUN/GENERAL_ LOCATION'('1 .4') = quarter'GEN PHRASE'('1 .4') = 'INDEX'('1 .5' )'GEN OBJECT'('1 .5') = 'INDEX'('1 .6' )'NUM'('1 .6') = '1991 ''NOUN/NIKON_CORP'('1 .6') = 'Nikon Corp .

The two occurrences of "excimer.
laser"were linked together correctly, however, the entity "light source " did not get properly linked in, since ouranalysis was not complete .Reference resolution is now performed using a discourse focus list .
To determine whether a definite nou nphrase refers to an entity which has already been mentioned in the discourse, it is compared with the mos trecent entity in the focus list, semantic feature checking is performed as before .Also, appositives such as "NSR-1755EX8A, a new stepper " and cases like "X as Y" are now handle dduring the first pass .
Thus "light source" can now be linked to "excimer laser" because it occurs in an "as"prepositional phrase and the two entities are of the same type .Following reference resolution, the mapping from the LSI internal templates to the MUC-5 output tem-plates is relatively straightforward .Answers to the specific questions posed about the MUC-5 templates generated from the walkthroug htext are given below .
(1) What information triggers the instantiation of eachof the two LITHOGRAPHY objects ?
"NSR-1755EX8A " triggered the first lithography object since it is a defined as a lithography system i nour concept hierarchy and there is a rule stating that equipment can trigger related process objects .In the second sentence, "the stepper" triggered the second lithography object by the rule given above .This is wrong because "the stepper " is co-referent with "NSR-1755EX8A" .
The two templates were no tlinked properly because "the stepper " gets linked to "a new stepper " , and DBG was unaware that "a ne wstepper" is "NSR-1755EX8A" since appositives were not handled in that version of the system .
This i scorrected in a more recent version of the system, where "the company's latest stepper" triggers the secon dlithography object .
(2) What information indicates the role of the NikonCorp .
for each Microelectronics Capability ?The concept hierarchy contains the information that Nikon is the manufacturer of "NSR-1755EX8A " , s othe manufacturer slot of "NSR-1755EX8A" is filled with a pointer to the "Nikon" object .
The MANUFAC-TURER role for the second Microelectronics Capability was not filled .
(3) Explain how your system captured the GRANULARIT Yinformation for "The company's latest stepper .
"We got " 0 .5 micron" for "The company's latest stepper" (which is correct) by pattern matching and b yaccident .
When we were filling out the granularity slot for "The company 's latest stepper " , "0 .5 micron "was the only granularity attribute available in the sentence, since "0 .45 micron" was already applied to "th estepper" in the same sentence .
(4) How does your system determine EQUIPMENT_TYPE for"the new stepper"?
and for "the company's lateststepper"?This knowledge is specified in our concept hierarchy (see above) .134(5) How does your system determine the STATUS of eac hequipment object ?Via a default rule, which fills otherwise unspecified "status" slots with "IN USE " .
(6) Why is the DEVICE object only instantiated forLITHOGRAPHY-1 ?The DEVICE object was not linked to LITHOGRAPHY-1 in our output .MUC-5 EXPERIENCE AND SUMMARYThe innovative aspect most responsible for our success this year was exploitation of the concept hierarchy ,especially the links from lexical items to concept nodes in the hierarchy, which facilitated generation of theinternal LSI templates .
Recall scores steadily improved during addition of slot-filling rules without signifi-cantly increasing overgeneration and compromising precision .
The preliminary addition of event semanticsdid not degrade system performance, but the complete system is not yet able to take full advantage of it .Improvements in this aspect of the DBG system should push scores significantly higher .REFERENCES[1] Montgomery, C.
