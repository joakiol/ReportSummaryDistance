A Pilot StudySumithra VelupillaiDepartment of Computer and Systems SciencesStockholm UniversitySwedensumithra@dsv.su.seAbstractOne of the most important features ofhealth care is to be able to follow a pa-tient?s progress over time and identifyevents in a temporal order.
We describeinitial steps in creating resources for au-tomatic temporal reasoning of Swedishmedical text.
As a first step, we focuson the identification of temporal expres-sions by exploiting existing resources andsystems available for English.
We adaptthe HeidelTime system and manually eval-uate its performance on a small subsetof Swedish intensive care unit documents.On this subset, the adapted version of Hei-delTime achieves a precision of 92% anda recall of 66%.
We also extract the mostfrequent temporal expressions from a sep-arate, larger subset, and note that most ex-pressions concern parts of days or specifictimes.
We intend to further develop re-sources for temporal reasoning of Swedishmedical text by creating a gold standardcorpus also annotated with events and tem-poral links, in addition to temporal expres-sions and their normalised values.1 IntroductionOne of the most important features of health careis to be able to follow patient progress over timeand identify clinically relevant events in a tempo-ral order.
In medical records, temporal informa-tion is stored with explicit timestamps, but it isalso documented in free text in the clinical nar-ratives.
To meet our overall goal of building ac-curate and useful information extraction systemsin the health care domain, our aim is to build re-sources for temporal reasoning in Swedish clini-cal text.
For instance, in the example sentenceMR-unders?okningen av skallen ig?ar visade attden v?a-sidiga f?or?andringen i thalamus minskat ivolym.
(?The MRI-scan of the scull yesterdayshowed that the left (abbreviated) side change inthalamus has decreased in volume?
), a temporalreasoning system should extract the event (MRI-scan of the scull) and the temporal expression(yesterday), and be able to normalise the time ex-pression to a specific date and classify the tempo-ral relation.In this pilot study we focus on the identifi-cation of temporal expressions, utilising existingresources and systems available for English.
Atemporal expression is defined as any mentionof dates, times, durations, and frequencies, e.g.
?April 2nd?, ?10:50am?, ?five hours ago?, and?every 2 hours?.
When successfully identifyingsuch expressions, subsequent anchoring in time ismade possible.Although English and Swedish are both Ger-manic languages, there are some differences thatare important to take into account when adapt-ing existing solutions developed for English toSwedish, e.g.
Swedish is more inflective and ismore compounding than English.The purpose of this study is to initiate our workon temporal reasoning for Swedish, and to evalu-ate existing solutions adapted to Swedish.
Theseare our first steps towards the creation of a refer-ence standard that can be used for evaluation offuture systems.2 BackgroundTemporal reasoning has been the focus of severalinternational natural language processing (NLP)challenges in the general domain such as ACE1,TempEval-2 and 3 (Verhagen et al., 2010; Uz-Zaman et al., 2013), and in the clinical domainthrough the 2012 i2b2 challenge (Sun et al., 2013).Most previous work has been performed on En-1http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/ace/88glish documents, but the TempEval series havealso included other languages, e.g.
Spanish.
Fortemporal modelling, the TimeML (Pustejovskyet al., 2010) guidelines are widely used.
TheTimeML standard denotes events (EVENT), tem-poral expressions (TIMEX3) and temporal rela-tions (TLINK).For English, several systems have been devel-oped for all or some of these subtasks, such asthe TARSQI Toolkit (Verhagen et al., 2005) andSUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012).
Both thesetools are rule-based, and rely on regular expres-sions and gazetteers.
The TARSQI Toolkit hasalso been developed for the clinical domain: Med-TTK (Reeves et al., 2013).In other domains, and for other languages, Hei-delTime (Str?otgen and Gertz, 2012) and TIMEN(Llorens et al., 2012) are examples of other rule-based systems.
These are also developed to beeasily extendable to new domains and languages.HeidelTime ranked first in the TempEval-3 chal-lenge on TIMEX3:s, resulting in an F1 of 77.61for the task of correctly identifying and normalis-ing temporal expressions.HeidelTime was also used in several participat-ing systems in the i2b2 challenge (Lin et al., 2013;Tang et al., 2013; Grouin et al., 2013) with suc-cess.
Top results for correctly identifying and nor-malising temporal expressions in the clinical do-main are around 66 F1 (Sun et al., 2013).
Thesystem has also been adapted for French clinicaltext (Hamon and Grabar, 2014).3 MethodsThe HeidelTime system was chosen for the ini-tial development of a Swedish temporal expres-sion identifier.
Given that its architecture is de-signed to be easily extendible for other languagesas well as domains, and after reviewing alternativeexisting systems, we concluded that it was suitablefor this pilot study.3.1 DataWe used medical records from an intensive careunit (ICU) from the Stockholm EPR Corpus, aclinical database from the Stockholm region inSweden2(Dalianis et al., 2012).
Each medi-cal record (document) contains all entries (notes)2Study approved by the Regional Ethical Review Boardin Stockholm (Etikpr?ovningsn?amnden i Stockholm), permis-sion number 2012/834-31/5about one patient a given day.
The document con-tains notes written by both physicians and nurses.They also contain headings (e.g.
Daganteckn-ing (?Daily note?
), Andning (?Breathing?))
andtimestamps for when a specific note/heading wasrecorded in the medical record system.
These areexcluded in this analysis.Three subsets from this ICU dataset were used:1) two randomly selected documents were used foranalysing and identifying domain specific time ex-pressions and regular expressions to be added inthe adaptation of HeidelTime (development set),2) a random sample of ten documents was used formanual analysis and evaluation (test set), and 3) aset of 100 documents was also extracted for thepurpose of empirically studying the types of tem-poral expressions found in the data by the adaptedsystem (validation set).3.2 Adaptation of HeidelTime andEvaluationThe available resources (keywords and regular ex-pression rules) in the HeidelTime system were ini-tially translated automatically (Google translate3)and manually corrected.
Regular expressions weremodified to handle Swedish inflections and otherspecific traits.
An initial analysis on two separate,randomly selected ICU notes (development set)was performed, as a first step in adapting for boththe Swedish language and the clinical domain.Results on the system performance were manu-ally evaluated on the test set by one computationallinguistics researcher by analysing system outputs:adding annotations when the system failed to iden-tify a temporal expression, and correcting systemoutput errors.
A contingency table was createdfor calculating precision, recall and F1, the mainoutcome measures.
Moreover, the top most fre-quent temporal expressions found by the systemon a separate set were extracted (validation set),for illustration and analysis purposes.4 ResultsWe report general statistics for the ICU corpus, re-sults from the adaptation and evaluation of Hei-delTime for Swedish (HTSwe) on the test set, andthe most frequent temporal expressions found byHTSwe in a separate set of 100 ICU documents(validation set).3http://translate.google.se894.1 Data: ICU corpusGeneral statistics for the test set used in this studyis shown in Table 1.
On average, each documentconsists of 54.6 sentences, and each sentence con-tains on average 8.7 tokens (including punctua-tion).
We observe that some sentences are veryshort (min = 1), and there is great variability inlength, as can be seen through the standard devia-tion.# min - max avg ?

Minimum,maximum, average and standard deviation for sen-tences per document and tokens (including punc-tuation) per sentence.4.2 Adaptation and evaluation ofHeidelTime: HTSweThe main modifications required in the adapta-tion of HeidelTime to Swedish (HTSwe) involvedhandling definite articles and plurals, e.g.
addingeftermiddag(en)?(ar)?(na)?
(?afternoon?, ?the af-ternoon?/?afternoons?/?the afternoons?).
Fromthe analysis of the small development set, someabbreviations were also added, e.g.
em (?after-noon?).
Regular expressions for handling typicalways dates are written in Swedish were added, e.g.?020812?
and ?31/12 -99?
(day, month, year).
Inorder to avoid false positives, a rule for handlingmeasurements that could be interpreted as years(e.g.
1900 ml) was also added (a negative rule).Results from running HTSwe on the test set areshown in Table 2.
HTSwe correctly identified 105temporal expressions, but missed 55 expressionsthat should have been marked, and classified 9expressions erroneously.
In total, there are 160TIMEX3s.
Overall performance was 92% preci-sion, 65% recall and F1 = 77%.The main errors were due to faulty regular ex-pressions for times, e.g.
13-tiden (?around 13 PM)and missing keywords such as dygn (?day?
- aword to indicate a full day, i.e.
24 hours) andlunchtid (?around lunch?).
Some missing key-words were specific for the clinical domain, e.g.efternatten (?the after/late night?, typical for shiftindication).
There were also some partial errors.For instance, i dag (?today?)
was only includedwith the spelling idag in the system, thus generat-ing a TIMEX3 output only for dag.TIMEX3 Other?Annotator AnnotatorTIMEX3 105 9 114HTSweOther 55 4580 4635HTSwe?160 4589 4749Table 2: Contingency table, TIMEX3 annotationsby the annotator and the adapted HeidelTime sys-tem for Swedish (HTSwe) on the test set.
?Other?means all other tokens in the corpus.
These resultsyield a precision of 92%, a recall of 66%, and F1= 77% for HTSwe.On the validation set, 168 unique time expres-sions were found by the system, and 1,178 in total.The most frequent expressions all denote parts ofdays, e.g.
idag (?today?
), nu (?now?
), and natten(?the night?
), see Table 3.
Specific times (mostlyspecific hours) were also very common.
Thus,there were many translated expressions in the Hei-delTime system that never occurred in the data.TIMEX3 N %idag (?today?)

Total = all TIMEX3:sfound by HTSwe in the entire validation set.
Therewere 168 unique TIMEX3s in the validation set.5 Discussion and ConclusionWe perform an initial study on automatic identifi-cation of temporal expressions in Swedish clinical90text by translating and adapting the HeidelTimesystem, and evaluating performance on SwedishICU records.
Results show that precision is high(92%), which is promising for our future develop-ment of a temporal reasoning system for Swedish.The main errors involve regular expressions fortime and some missing keywords; these expres-sions will be added in our next iteration in thiswork.
Our results, F1 = 77%, are lower than state-of-the-art systems for English clinical text, wherethe top-performing system in the 2010 i2b2 Chal-lenge achieved 90% F1 for TIMEX3 spans (Sunet al., 2013).
However, given the small size of thisstudy, results are encouraging, and we have cre-ated a baseline system which can be used for fur-ther improvements.The adaptation and translation of HeidelTimeinvolved extending regular expressions and rulesto handle Swedish inflections and specific ways ofwriting dates and times.
Through a small, initialanalysis on a development set, some further ad-ditions and modifications were made, which ledto the correct identification of common TIMEX3spresent in this type of document.
A majority ofthe expressions translated from the original systemwas not found in the data.
Hence, it is worthwhileanalysing a small subset to inform the adaptationof HeidelTime.The ICU notes are an interesting and suit-able type of documentation for temporal reason-ing studies, as they contain notes on the progressof patients in constant care.
However, from the re-sults it is evident that the types of TIMEX3 expres-sions are rather limited and mostly refer to partsof days or specific times.
Moreover, as recall waslower (66%), there is clearly room for improve-ment.
We plan to extend our study to also includeother report types.5.1 LimitationsThere are several limitations in this study.
The cor-pus is very small, and evaluated only by one an-notator, which limits the conclusions that can bedrawn from the analysis.
For the creation of a ref-erence standard, we plan to involve at least oneclinician, in order to get validation from a domainexpert, and to be able to calculate inter-annotatoragreement.
The size of the corpus will also be in-creased.
We have not evaluated performance onTIMEX3 normalisation, which, of course, is cru-cial for an accurate temporal reasoning system.For instance, we have not considered the categoryFrequency, which is essential in the clinical do-main to capture e.g.
medication instructions anddosages.
Moreover, we have not annotated andevaluated events.
This is perhaps the most im-portant part of a temporal reasoning system.
Weplan to utilise existing named entity taggers de-veloped in our group as a pre-annotation step inthe creation of our reference standard.
The laststep involves annotating temporal links (TLINK)between events and TIMEX3:s. We believe thatpart-of-speech (PoS) and/or syntactic informationwill be a very important component in an end-to-end system for this task.
We plan to tailor an exist-ing Swedish PoS tagger, to better handle Swedishclinical text.5.2 ConclusionOur main finding is that it is feasible to adapt Hei-delTime to the Swedish clinical domain.
More-over, we have shown that the parts of days andspecific times are the most frequent temporal ex-pressions in Swedish ICU documents.This is the first step towards building resourcesfor temporal reasoning in Swedish.
We believethese results are useful for our continued endeav-our in this area.
Our next step is to add furtherkeywords and regular expressions to improve re-call, and to evaluate TIMEX3 normalisation.
Fol-lowing that, we will annotate events and temporallinks.To our knowledge, this is the first study on tem-poral expression identification in Swedish clinicaltext.
All resulting gazetteers and guidelines in ourfuture work on temporal reasoning in Swedish willbe made publicly available.AcknowledgmentsThe author wishes to thank the anonymous review-ers for invaluable comments on this manuscript.Thanks also to Danielle Mowery and Dr. WendyChapman for all their support.
