AnHPSG-FrameNet map was constructedfrom a semantically annotated corpus, andsemantic parsing was performed by map-ping HPSG dependencies to FrameNet re-lations.
The semantic parsing was evalu-ated in a Senseval-3 task; the results sug-gested that there is a high contribution ofsyntactic information to semantic analysis.1 IntroductionThis paper presents semantic parsing based onlyon HPSG parses, and examines the contribution ofthe syntactic information to semantic analysis.In computational linguistics, many researchershave studied the relationship between syntax andsemantics.
Its quantitative analysis was formal-ized as semantic parsing, or semantic role label-ing, and has attracted the attention of researchers.Recently, an improvement in the accuracy androbustness of ?deep parsers?
has enabled us to di-rectly map deep syntactic dependencies to seman-tic relations.
Deep parsers are based on linguisti-cally expressive grammars; e.g.
HPSG, LFG, etc,and less affected by syntactic alternations such aspassivization.
Their results are therefore expectedto closely relate to semantic annotations.
For ex-ample, the sentences in figure 1 share the sameset of semantic roles, and the roles have one-to-one relations to deep syntactic dependencies in thesentences.
However, the results of the deep parsersare represented in complex structures, shown infigure 3, and cannot be straightforwardly com-pared to semantic annotations.In order to directly map the deep dependenciesto semantic relations, we adapted the corpus anal-ysis method of (Frank and Semecky?, 2004) forthe semantic parsing using HPSG parses.
We per-formed the semantic parsing by mapping paths inHPSG parses to semantic predicate-argument re-lations.
The analysis of the HPSG paths for thepredicate-argument pairs, and the preliminary re-sult of the semantic parsing indicate the contribu-tion of syntactic analysis to semantic parsing.2 Related WorkBesides (Frank and Semecky?, 2004)?s work, asmentioned above, there have been several studieson the relationship between deep syntax and se-mantic parsing.
Although the studies did not focuson direct mappings between deep syntax and shal-low semantics, they suggested a strong relation-ship between the two.
(Miyao and Tsujii, 2004)evaluated the accuracy of an HPSG parser againstPropBank semantic annotations, and showed thatthe HPSG dependants correlated with semantic ar-guments of the PropBank, particularly with ?core?arguments.
In (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003)and (Zhang et al, 2008), features from deep parseswere used for semantic parsing, together with fea-tures from CFG or dependency parses.
The deepfeatures were reported to contribute to a perfor-mance gain.3 Syntactic and Semantic ParsingSome semantic relations are easily identified byusing syntactic parsing while others are more diffi-cult.
This section presents easy and difficult casesin syntax-semantics map construction.Trivial when using syntactic analysis: Syn-tactic parsing, including CFG analysis, detectssemantic similarity of sentences sharing similarphrase structures.
For the example sentences a)and b) in figure 1, the parsing provides similarphrase structures, and therefore gives the samesyntactic dependency to occurrences of each role.Trivial when using deep analysis: Deep pars-ing reveals the semantic similarity of sentences85a) ?, ICommunicator praise themEvaluee for being 99 percent perfectReason.b) ?, but heCommunicator praised the Irish premierEvaluee for making a ``sensible??

The sen-tences c) and d) in figure 1 contain passivizationand object raising, while deep parsing providesone dependency for each role in the figure.Not trivial even when using deep analysis:Some semantic arguments are not direct syntacticdependants of their predicates - especially of nounpredicates.
In sentence e) in figure 2, the Evalueephrase depends on the predicate praise, throughthe support verb receive.
The deep analysis wouldbe advantageous in capturing such dependencies,because it provides receive with direct links to thephrases of the role and the predicate.Problematic when using only syntactic analy-sis: Sometimes, the semantic role of a phrase isstrongly dependent on the type of the mentionedentity, rather than on the syntactic dependency.
Inphrases f) and g) in figure 2, the phrases Alice andVersace, have the same syntactic relation to thepredicate dress.
However, the Wearer role is givenonly to the former phrase.4 A Wide-Coverage HPSG ParserWe employed a wide-coverage HPSG parser forsemantic parsing, and used deep syntactic depen-dencies encoded in a Predicate Argument Struc-ture (PAS) in each parse node.In our experiments, the parser results were con-sidered as graphs, as illustrated by figures 3 and 4,to extract HPSG dependencies conveniently.

PAS types, e.g.
verb arg12,etc., and by the added edges.
Note that the inter-pretation of the edge labels depends on the PAStype.
If the PAS type is verb arg12, the ARG2 de-pendant is the object of the transitive verb or itsequivalence (the subject of the passive, etc.).
Ifthe PAS type is prep arg12, then the dependant isthe NP governed by the preposition node.5 Semantic Parsing Based on FrameNetWe employed FrameNet (FN) as a semantic cor-pus.
Furthermore, we evaluated our semantic pars-ing on the SRL task data of Senseval-3 (Litkowski,2004), which consists of FN annotations.In FN, semantic frames are defined, and eachframe is associated with predicates that evoke theframe.
For instance, the verb and noun praise arepredicates of the Judgment communication frame,and they share the same set of semantic roles.The Senseval-3 data is a standard for evaluationof semantic parsing.
The task is defined as identi-fying phrases and their semantic roles for a givensentence, predicate, and frame.
The data includesnull instantiations of roles1, which are ?conceptu-ally salient?, but do not appear in the text.6 MethodsThe semantic parsing using an HPSG-FN mapconsisted of the processes shown in figure 5.1An example of a null instantiation is the Communicatorrole in the sentence, ?All in all the conference was acclaimedas a considerable success.?86Map?construc?n?HPSG?parsingRaw?sentences?Seman??annota?ns?Training?data?HPSG?parses?Phrase?projec?n?HPSG?parses?with?seman?ally?marked?nodes?HPSG?dependency?extrac?n?HPSG?dependency?between??predicate1?and?role1?Map?instances?HPSG?dependency?between??predicate1?and?role2?HPSG?parsingRaw?sentences?Predicate?annota?ns?Test?data?HPSG?parses?Phrase?projec?n?HPSG?parses?with?nodes?marked?as?predicates?Role?node?predic?nFeature?filter?HPSG?parses?with?seman?ally?marked?nodes?Role?predic?n?rules?Seman??parsing?

?Table 2: Syntactic features for role prediction.Phrase projection: Because we used FN anno-tations, which are independent of any syntacticframework, role phrases needed to be projectedto appropriate HPSG nodes.
We projected thephrases based on maximal projection, which wasgenerally employed, with heads defined in theHPSG.HPSG dependency extraction: As an HPSGdependency for a predicate-argument pair, weused the shortest path between the predicate nodeand the argument node in the HPSG parse.
Thepath was then represented by pre-defined fea-tures, listed in table 1.
The search for the short-est path was done in the simplified graph of theHPSG parse (see figure 4), with the edges denot-ing deep dependencies, and head-child relations.An instance of the HPSG-FN map consisted of thepath?s features, the FN frame, and the role label.Role node prediction: The role prediction wasbased on simple rules with scores.
The rules wereobtained by filtering features of the map instances.Table 2 shows the feature filters.
The score of arule was the number of map instances matchingthe rule?s features.
In the test, for each node of aHPSG parse, the role label with the highest scorewas selected as the result, where the score of a la-bel was that of the rule providing the label.7 ExperimentsFor the experiments, we employed a wide cover-age HPSG parser, Enju version 2.3.12, and the datafor the Semantic Role Labeling task of Senseval-3.7.1 Analysis of Map InstancesWe extracted 41,193 HPSG-FN map instancesfrom the training set, the training data apart fromthe development set.
The instances amounted to97.7 % (41,193 / 42,163) of all the non-null in-stantiated roles in the set, and HPSG paths wereshort for many instances.
Paths to syntactic ar-guments were almost directly mapped to semanticroles, while roles for other phrases were more am-biguous.The length distribution of HPSG paths: 64 %(26410 / 41193) of the obtained HPSG paths werelength-one, and 8 % (3390 / 41193) were length-two, due to the effect of direct links provided byHPSG parsing.
The length of a path was defined2http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/enju/87Pred.

Table 4 shows the overall performance.
Thescores were measured by the Senseval-3 officialscript, in the restrictive setting, and can be directlycompared to other systems?
scores.
Since our pre-liminary system of semantic parsing ignored nullinstantiations of roles, it lost around 0.10 pointof the recalls.
We believe that such instantia-tions may be separately treated.
Although the sys-tem was based on only the syntactic information,and was very na?
?ve, the system?s performance waspromising, and showed the high contribution ofsyntactic dependencies for semantic parsing.8 ConclusionThis paper presents semantic parsing based ononly HPSG parses, and investigates the contribu-tion of syntactic information to semantic parsing.We constructed an HPSG-FN map by findingthe HPSG paths that corresponded to semantic re-lations, and used it as role prediction rules in se-mantic parsing.
The semantic parsing was evalu-ated on the SRL task data of Senseval-3.

A next stepfor accurate HPSG-FN mapping could be analy-sis of the interaction between the HPSG-FN mapand other information, such as named entity typeswhich were shown to be effective in many studies.AcknowledgmentsThis work was partially supported by Grant-in-Aidfor Specially Promoted Research (MEXT, Japan)and Special Coordination Funds for PromotingScience and Technology (MEXT, Japan).ReferencesAnette Frank and Jir???
