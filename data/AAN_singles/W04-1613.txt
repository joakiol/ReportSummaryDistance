Letter-to-Sound Conversion for Urdu Text-to-Speech SystemSarmad HUSSAINCenter for Research in Urdu Language Processing,National University of Computer and Emerging SciencesB Block, Faisal TownLahore, Pakistansarmad.hussain@nu.edu.pkAbstractUrdu is spoken by more than 100 millionpeople across a score countries and is thenational language of Pakistan (http://www.ethnologue.com).
There is a great need fordeveloping a text-to-speech system for Urdubecause this population has low literacy rateand therefore speech interface would greatlyassist in providing them access to information.One of the significant parts of a text-to-speechsystem is a natural language processor whichtakes textual input and converts it into anannotated phonetic string.
To enable this, it isnecessary to develop models which maptextual input onto phonetic content.
Thesemodels may be very complex for variouslanguages having unpredictable behaviour(e.g.
English), but Urdu shows a relativelyregular behaviour and thus Urdu pronunciationmay be modelled from Urdu text by definingfairly regular rules.
These rules have beenidentified and explained in this paper.1 IntroductionText-to-speech synthesis is logically divided intotwo stages.
The first stage takes raw text input,processes it and converts it into precise phoneticstring to be spoken, appropriately annotated withprosodic markers (e.g.
stress and intonation).
Thesecond stage takes this phonetic representation ofspeech and generates the appropriate digital signalusing a particular synthesis technique.
Thesestages may be referred to as Natural LanguageProcessing (NLP) and Speech Synthesis (SS)respectively (e.g.
Dutoit 1997, p.14).For SS, formant based techniques (e.g.
Klatt1980) or diphone based techniques (e.g.
Dutoit1997) are normally employed and are generallyscript independent (as they are only dependent ontemporal and spectral acoustic properties of thelanguage and take input in script-neutral form, e.g.in IPA).
However, NLP is very dependent oncultural and linguistic specific usage of script.NLP may also be divided into further parts.
Thefirst component is dedicated to pre-processing,?cleaning?
and normalizing input text.
Once theinput text is normalized, the second componentdoes phonological processing to generate a moreprecise phonetic string to be spoken.
One of thefirst tasks in the Phonological ProcessingComponent is to convert the input text into aphonemic string using Letter-to-Sound (LTS)rules.
This string is then eventually converted toprecise phonetic transcription after application ofsound change rules and other annotations, asexplained later.
This paper overviews Urduwriting system, phonemic inventory, NLP for TTSand gives details of the LTS rules for Urdu (alsosee Rafique et at.
(2001) and Hussain (1997:Appendix A), for introductory work).2 Urdu Writing System and PhonemicInventoryUrdu is written in Arabic script in Nastaleeqstyle using an extended Arabic character set.Nastaleeq is a cursive, context-sensitive and highlycomplex writing system (Hussain 2003).
Thecharacter set includes basic and secondary letters,aerab (or diacritical marks), punctuation marks andspecial symbols (Hussain and Afzal 2001, Afzaland Hussain 2001).
Urdu is normally written withonly the letters.
However, the letters represent justthe consonantal content of the string and in somecases (under-specified) vocalic content.
Thevocalic content can be (optionally) completelyspecified by using the aerab with the letters.
Aerabare normally not written and are assumed to beknown by the native speaker, thus making it veryhard for a foreigner to read.
Certain aerab are alsoused to specify additional consonants.
Urdu lettersand aerab are given in Table 1 below.?

?Table 2: Urdu (a) Consonantal and (b) Vocalicphonemic inventory3 NLP for Urdu TTSAs discussed earlier, to enable text-to-speechsystem for any language, a Natural LanguageProcessing component is required.
The NLPsystem may have differing requirement fordifferent languages.
However, it always takes rawtext input and always outputs precise phonetictranscription for a language.
The system can bedivided into two parts, Text-NormalizationComponent and Phonological ProcessingComponent.
These components may be furtherdivided.
A simplified schematic is shown inFigure 11.Figure 1: NLP architecture for Urdu TTS system1 This diagram is based on the architecture of UrduText to Speech system under development at Center forResearch in Urdu Language Processing(www.crulp.org).TokenizerSemanticTaggerStringGeneratorLetter to SoundConverterSound ChangeManagerSyllabifierStress MarkerIntonationMarkerUrdu RawText InputNormalizedUrdu TextAnnotated PhoneticOutputThe Text Normalization component takes acharacter string as input and converts it into astring of letters.
Within it, the Tokenizer uses thepunctuation marks and space between words tomark token boundaries which are then stamped aswords, punctuation, date, time and other relevantcategories by the Semantic Tagger.
The StringGenerator takes any non-letter based input (e.g.
anumber or a date containing digits) and converts itinto a letter string.After the input is converted into a stringcomprising only of letters, the PhonologicalProcessing Component generates thecorresponding phonetic transcription.
This is donethrough a series of processes.
The first process isto use Letter-to-Sound Converter (detailed below)to convert the normalized text input to a phonemicstring.
This process may also be referred to asgrapheme-to-phoneme conversion.
This isfollowed by Syllabifier, which marks syllableboundaries.
The intermediate output is thenforwarded to a module which applies Urdu soundchange rules to generate the correspondingphonetic string.
Following these modules, StressMarker and Intonation Marker modules add stressand intonation to the string being processed.
Re-syllabification is also performed after soundchange rules are applied, in case phones areepenthesized or deleted and syllable boundariesrequire re-adjustment.
Urdu shows a reasonablyregular behavior and most of these tasks can beachieved through rule-based systems (e.g.
seeHussain 1997 for stress assignment algorithm).This paper focuses on Letter-to-Sound rules forUrdu, the first in the series of modules inPhonological Processing Component.4 Urdu Letter to Sound RulesUrdu shows a very regular mapping fromgraphemes to phonemes.
However, to explain thebehavior, the letters need to be further classifiedinto the following categories:a. Consonantal charactersb.
Dual (consonantal and vocalic) behaviorcharactersc.
Vowel modifier characterd.
Consonant modifier charactere.
Composite (consonantal and vocalic) characterSimilarly, the aerab set can also be divided intothe following categories:f. Basic vowel specifierg.
Extended vowel specifierh.
Consonantal gemination specifieri.
Dual (vocalic and consonantal) insertorFinally, there is a third category which may takeshape of an letter and aerab:j. Vowel-aerab placeholderThe Consonantal characters in (a) above alwaysrepresent a consonant of Urdu.
In Urdu, there isalways a single consonant corresponding to asingle character of this category, unlike some otherlanguages e.g.
English maps ?ph?
string tophoneme /f/.
Most of the Urdu consonantalcharacters fall into this category.
These charactersand corresponding consonantal phonemes aregiven in Table 3 below.
A simple mapping rulewould generate the phoneme corresponding tothese characters.?

h n m lTable 3: Consonantal characters and theircorresponding phonemesThree characters of Urdu show dual behavior,i.e.
in certain contexts they transform intoconsonants, but in certain other contexts, theytransform into vowels.
These characters are Alef(?
), vao (?
), and Yay (?
or ?).
Alef actsexceptionally in this category and therefore it isdiscussed separately in (j) below.
Vao changes to/v/ and Yay changes to the approximant /j/ whenthey occur in consonantal positions (in onset orcoda of a syllable).
However, when they occur asnucleus of a syllable, they form long vowels.
Asan example, Yay occurs as a consonant when itoccurs in the onset of single syllable word  ?/Z?
(/jar/, ?friend?)
but is a vowel when it occurs wordmedially in L??
?
?Z (/b?l/, ?ox?).
These charactersrepresent category (b) listed above.There is only one character in category (c), theletter Noon Ghunna (?
), which does not add anyadditional sound to the string but only nasalizes thepreceding vowel.
This letter follows and combineswith the category (b) characters (when occurring asvowels) to form the nasal long vowels, e.g.
/??(/d?
?/, ?go?)
vs.
?/??
( /d??
?/, ?life?).
Catergory(d) is the letter Do-Chashmey Hay (?
), whichcombines with all the stops and affricates to formaspirated (breathy or voiceless) consonants butdoes not add an additional phoneme.
It may alsocombine with nasal stops and approximants toform their aspirated versions, though these soundsare not clearly established phonetically.
As anexample, adding this character adds aspiration tothe phoneme /p/:  LZ?
( /p?l/, ?moment?)
vs. L?
?\(/p?
?l/, ?fruit?).
Finally, there is also a singlecharacter in category (e), the Alef Madda (?).
Thischaracter is a stylistic way of writing two Alefsand thus represents an Alef in consonantal position(see (j) below) and an Alef in vocalic position,forming /a/ vowel, e.g.
???
(/?b/, ?now?)
vs.
???
(/?b/, ?water?
).There are three Basic vowel aerab used in Urducalled Zabar (Arabic Fatha), Zer (Arabic Kasra)and Pesh (Arabic Damma).
In addition, absence ofthese aerab also define certain vowels and thus thisabsence is referred to as Null aerab.
They combinewith characters to form vowels according to thefollowing principles:(i) Short vowels, when they occur with category(a) and (b) consonants not followed bycategory (b) letters.
(ii) Long vowels, when they occur with category(a) and (b) consonants followed andcombined by category (b) characters.
(iii) Long nasal vowels, when they combine withcategory (a) and (b) consonants followed bycategory (b) characters followed by category(c) Noon Ghunna.Different combination of these aerab withcategory (b) characters generate the variousvowels, as indicated in Table  4 (all vowels shownin combination with ?
(phoneme /b/) as aconsonant character is required as a placeholder forthe aerab).Bay + Zabar ??

It is controversial whether Zer ispresent for the representation of vowel /i/.
One solutionis to process both cases till the diction controversy issolved.Bay + (Null | Zer) + Yay +Noon Ghunna(see Footnote 2)Z??
?O ?
i?Table 4: Letter and aerab combinations andcorresponding vowelsExistence of the remaining vocalic phoneme /?/is controversial in Urdu as there is no way ofexpressing it using the Urdu writing system andbecause it is schwa conditioned by the following/h/ phoneme and only occurs in this context.However, it may exist phonetically e.g.
in the word<??
(/?
?h?r/, ?city?)
(see discussion in Qureshi,1992; also see some supporting acoustic evidencein Fatima et.
al, 2003, e.g.
duration of /?/ is 136 mscompared with 235 ms for /?/).The next category (g) consists of Khari Zabar.This represents the vowel Alef and, wheneveroccurs on top of a Vao or Yay, replaces thesesounds with the Alef vowel sound /a/ as in words?P???
(/z?k?t/,"zakat") and T ????
(/?
?l?/, special").Sporadically Khari Zer and Ulta Pesh are referredto in Urdu as well but they generally do not occuron Urdu words.
These are not considered here.The gemination mark of category (h) is calledShad in Urdu and occurs on consonantal characters(of categories (a, b) except Alef).
Shad geminatesthe consonant on which it occurs, which isnormally word medially and inter-vocalically.
Asa result of gemination, the duplicate consonant actsas coda of previous syllable and onset of followingsyllable.
For example, 9??
( /??.d?
?/, "a poorperson") vs.
9???
( /??d?.d?
?/, "mattress").The category (i) aerab, called Do-Zabar onlyoccurs on Alef (in vocalic position) and convertsthe long vowel /a/ to short schwa followed byconsonant /n/, e.g.
in word ??P??
(/f?r?n/,"immediately").
Do-Zer and Do-Pesh are similarlyreferred to in Urdu but are not generatively usedand are mostly in foreign words especially ofArabic and are not considered further here.
Ifconsidered, they would present a similar analysis.Finally, (j) is a very interesting category as itrepresents allo-graphs Alef and Hamza (former acharacter and latter (arguably) an aerab andcharacter3).
Both of them are default markers andoccur in complimentary distribution, Alef alwaysword initially and Hamza always otherwise.
Asdiscussed earlier, aerab in Urdu always need aKursi (?seat").
If  a short vowel occurs wordinitially without a consonant (i.e.
in a syllablewhich has no onset), there is no placeholder foraerab.
A default place holder is necessary and Alefis used.
Word medially, if there is an onset-lesssyllable, Urdu faces the same problem.
In thesecases, Hamza (instead of Alef) is used as aplaceholder for aerab.
There are two furtherpossible sub-cases.
In one, the preceding syllableis open and ends with a vowel.
This case is veryfrequent and Hamza is introduced inter.-vocalically(e.g.
?/??9?
/fa.
?d?h/, ?advantage?).
In the secondless productive sub-case, the preceding syllable isclosed by a coda consonant.
In this case, Hamza is(optionally) used with Alef (e.g.
both forms arecorrect: ??<??
/ ?<???
??
/d??r.
?t/, ?courage?
).Hindi which employs a different mechanism bydefining different shapes for vowels word-initiallyand word-medially (Matras).
The Matras areanchored onto the consonants, e.g.
in Aana?vaalaa , ?about to come?
vowel /a/ is written asAa word initially, but is written as a wordmedially).These rules have been implemented in an on-going project (see Footnote 1 above) and aresuccessfully generating the desired phonemicoutput.
This phonemic output is passed throughsound change rule module to generate the desiredphonetic form.5 ConclusionThis paper briefly discusses the architecture ofNatural Language Processing portion of an UrduText-to-Speech system.
It explains the details ofUrdu consonantal and vocalic system and Urduletters.
Urdu shows regular behavior and thus thephonemic forms are predictable from the textualinput.
The letter-to-sound rules define this3 Hamza sometimes requires a Kursi or seat (L?/?
andnot ?/?? )
and sometimes does not (???Z?
and not P???Z?
)indicating it behaves both like a character and an aerab.It is still unclear on how this behavior is distributed andwhether it is predictable.
As it is a script centric issue, itis not discussed further here.mapping and are thus essential for developingUrdu TTS.6 AcknowledgementsThis work has been partially supported by thegrant for "Urdu Localization Project: MT, TTS andLexicon" by E-Government Directorate ofMinistry of IT and Telecommunications,Government of Pakistan.The author also wishes to thank anonymousreviewers for comments, especially on glottal stopand Hamza and Tahira Khizar and Qasim Vaincefor eventual discussion on the role of Hamza inUrdu script.ReferencesM.
