{ahmed.hamdi,nuria.gala,alexis.nasr}@lif.univ-mrs.frAbstractThe sociolinguistic situation in Arabic countries is characterized by diglossia (Ferguson, 1959) :whereas one variant Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is highly codified and mainly used for writ-ten communication, other variants coexist in regular everyday?s situations (dialects).
Similarly,while a number of resources and tools exist for MSA (lexica, annotated corpora, taggers, parsers.
.
.
), very few are available for the development of dialectal Natural Language Processing tools.Taking advantage of the closeness of MSA and its dialects, one way to solve the problem of thelack of resources for dialects consists in exploiting available MSA resources and NLP tools inorder to adapt them to process dialects.
This paper adopts this general framework: we propose amethod to build a lexicon of deverbal nouns for Tunisian (TUN) using MSA tools and resourcesas starting material.1 IntroductionThe Arabic language presents both a standard written form and a number of spoken variants (dialects).While dialects differ from one country to another, sometimes even within the same country, the writtenvariety (Modern Standard Arabic, MSA), is the same for all the Arabic countries.
Similarly, MSA ishighly codified, and used mainly for written communication and formal spoken situations (news, politicaldebates).
Spoken varieties are used in informal daily discussions and in informal written communicationon the web (social networks, blogs and forums).
Such unstandardized varieties differ from MSA withrespect to phonology, morphology, syntax and the lexicon.
Linguistic resources (lexica, corpora) andnatural language processing (NLP) tools for such dialects (parsers) are very rare.Different approaches are discussed in the litterature to cope with Arabic dialects processing.
A gen-eral solution is to build specific resources and tools.
For example, (Maamouri et al., 2004) created aLevantine annotated corpus (oral transcriptions) for speech recognition research.
(Habash et al., 2005;Habash and Rambow, 2006) proposed a system including a morphological analyzer and a generator forArabic dialects (MAGEAD) used for MSA and Levantine Arabic.
(Habash et al., 2012) also built amorphological analyzer for Egyptian Arabic that extends an existing resource, the Egyptian ColloquialArabic Lexicon.
Other approaches take advantage of the special relation (closeness) that exists betweeenMSA and dialects in order to adapt MSA resources and tools to dialects.
To name a few, (Chiang etal., 2006) used MSA treebanks to parse Levantine Arabic.
(Sawaf, 2010) presented a translation systemfor handling dialectal Arabic, using an algorithm to normalize spontaneous and dialectal Arabic intoMSA.
(Salloum and Habash, 2013) developped a translation system pivoting through MSA from someArabic dialects (Levantine, Egyptian, Iraqi, and Gulf Arabic) to English.
(Hamdi et al., 2013) proposeda translation system between Tunisian (TUN) and MSA verbs using an analyser and a generator for bothvariants.Yet if the first kind of approach is more linguistically accurate because it takes into account specificitiesof each dialect, building resources from scratch is costly and extremely time consuming.
In this paperwe will thus adopt the second approach: we will present a method to automatically build a lexicon forTunisian deverbal nouns by exploiting available MSA resources as well as an existing MSA-TUN lexiconThis work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

We will use a root lexicon to generate possible deverbal nouns whichwill be later filtered through a large MSA lexicon.This work is part of a larger project that aims at ?translating?
TUN to an approximative form of MSAin order to use MSA NLP tools on the output of this translation process.
The final lexicon for TUNdeverbal nouns will be integrated into a morphological and syntactic parser for TUN.The paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we describe and compare some morphological aspectsof MSA and TUN, focusing on derivation.
We then discuss in section 3 our approach to build a TUN lex-icon for deverbal nouns from an existing MSA-TUN resource for verbs.
Section 4 presents an evaluationof the results obtained and section 5 proposes some solutions to increase the coverage of the lexicon.2 Arabic MorphologyArabic words are built following two kinds of morphological operations: templatic and affixational.Functionally, both operations are used inflectionally or derivationally (Habash, 2010).
In templatic mor-phology, a root and a pattern combine to form a word stem.
A root is a sequence of three, four or fiveletters that defines an abstract notion while a pattern is a vocalized template which marks where the rootradicals are inserted.
To give an example, by combining the root hH?
f t H1with the verbal patterns1a2a3 and ta1a22a3, two verbs are generated : (1) iJ?
fataH ?to open?
and (2) iJ?K tafattaH ?to bloom?.Derivation consists in replacing each digit of the pattern by the corresponding letter in the root.Arabic verbs have ten basic triliteral patterns, which are conventionally noted with the Latin numbersI, .
.
.
, X. and two basic quadriliteral patterns (XI, XII) (Habash, 2010).
A verb is the combination of aroot and a pattern.Many deverbal nouns can be derived from verbs.
Nine kind of deverbal nouns (1, 2, 3 ... 9) are definedin Arabic (Al-Ghulayaini, 2010), each of them corresponds to a semantic relationship between the verband the deverbal noun (see table 1).1 ??A??

These deverbal nouns represent the active and the passiveparticiples of these verbs.
They are derived from the same root as the verb, using deverbal patternswhich depend on the verbal pattern.
Table 2 shows TUN and MSA patterns of the active and the passiveparticiples for the first three verbal patterns.Table 2 is just a sample of a larger table of deverbal nouns (henceforth called TUN-MSA deverbaltable) that defines for every verbal pattern all deverbals which are derived from it in MSA and TUN.1Arabic orthographic transliteration is presented in the Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter HSB scheme (Habash et al., 2007): (inalphabetical order)@ H.HH h.h p XX PP ??

Unlike MSA, which defines a unique patternfor each participle with all verbal patterns, table 2 shows that TUN has often more than one pattern forparticiples.
However, for some other cases, such as the infinitive forms and nouns of instruments, MSAdefines several nominal patterns.
The choice of the nominal pattern depends on the verbal pattern.The Arabic nominal derivation system is not systematic and depends on the meaning of the verbs.In fact, for semantic reasons, most Arabic verbs cannot derive all deverbal nouns.
The verb iJ?
fataH?open?, for example, cannot produce the noun of place and time.
However, iJ?
fataH derives the activeand the passive participles l'A?
fAtiH ?opener?
and h?J??
maftuwH ?opened?, the noun of instrumenthAJ??
miftAH ?key?
and an exaggerate form hAJ?
fattAH ?conqueror?...3 Overview of the MethodOur method consists in generating TUN and MSA pairs of deverbal nouns simultaneously: in a first step,we use the TUN-MSA deverbal table and an existing MSA-TUN dictionary of verbs in order to generatecandidate pairs of deverbal nouns (NOUNMSA, NOUNTUN).
These candidates are then filtered on theMSA side using an available MSA resource.3.1 Generating pairs of deverbal nounsAs shown in the TUN-MSA deverbal table (Table 2), every verbal pattern in MSA produces severalpatterns of deverbal nouns (i.e., pattern IX2yields for example the infinitive form Ai12i3A3).
The sameapplies to TUN (i.e., pattern IX yields the infinitive form 12uw3iyy).
A total of 54 MSA and 52 TUNnominal patterns were defined.
To generate deverbal lexicon we have used an existing TUN-MSA lexicon(Boujelbane et al., 2013) of 1500 verbs composed of pairs of the form (PMSA, PTUN) where PMSAandPTUNare themselves pairs made of a root and a verbal pattern.
The TUN side contains 920 distinct pairsand the MSA side 1,478 distinct pairs.
This difference shows that MSA is lexically richer than TUN.
Forevery pair (a pattern and a root) we combined the root with all the nominal patterns corresponding to theverbal pattern on both sides (MSA and TUN) as shown in figure 1.VERB PAT.
DEV.
NOUN MSA PAT.
TUN PAT.MSA TUN MSA TUNINPUT:VERBAL LEXICON OUTPUT:DEVERBAL NOUNS LEXICONFigure 1: Generating TUN-MSA pairs of deverbal nouns using verbsAt this point, about twenty morphological and orthographic rules manually predefined are applied onthe generated form in order to produce a lemma.
For instance, the second root radical /y/ and /w/ changesto /?y/ for MSA active participle, while the second root radical /w/ changes to /y/ in the TUN side.
Another2The MSA and TUN IX patterns are respectively Ai12a33 and 12A397rule which is common for MSA and TUN requires that the /t/ of the verbal pattern Ai1ta2a3 (VIII) andall nominal forms which derive from it, change to a /T/ if the first letter on the radical is /S/, /T/, /D/ or/Z/ : e.g.
masdar H.@Q?
@ AiDtirAb becomes H.@Q??
@ AiDTirAb ?trouble?.Following this step, a lexicon of 137, 199 nominal entries (NounMSA, NounTUN) was obtained.3.2 FilteringAs it was expected, the generation method described above overgenerates: it can produce correct pairsas well as wrong pairs.
Four cases have been identified:1.
Both TUN and MSA nouns are correct2.
TUN noun is wrong and MSA noun is correct3.
MSA noun is wrong and TUN noun is correct4.
Both forms are wrongTo give an example from the verbal lexicon entry (iJ?,?g) (fataHMSA, HallTUN) ?to open?, wecan generate these four situations :1. passive participle : (h?J?
?, ???m?)
(maftuwHMSA,maHluwlTUN) ?opened?, both words are cor-rect.2.
exaggerate form : (hAJ?, ?Cg) (fattAHMSA, HallAlTUN), in this case TUN noun is wrong butthe MSA noun is correct ?conqueror?.3.
noun of place : (iJ??,?m?)
(maftaHMSA,mHallTUN), in this case TUN noun is correct ?shop,store?
while the MSA noun does not exist.
The TUN noun is obtained after the application of thegemination3rule.
The allows deleting the vowel between the second and the third radical.4.
analogous adjective : (iJJ?, ?Cm?)
(ftiyHMSA,miHlAlTUN), both nouns are wrong.Situations (3) and (4) can be handeled by filtering the MSA part using an MSA resource.
In order todo so, we have used three resources :?
an Arabic corpus made of reports of the French Press Agency (AFP), which contains 1.5 millionword forms.
From these words, we have extracted 10, 595 types of nominal lemmas using theArabic morphological analyser MADA (Habash et al., 2009).
Only pairs that have the MSA nounin the corpus have been kept.
At the end of this stage, we have obtained a lexicon of 20130 entries :8441 MSA nouns and 2636 TUN nouns.?
an MSA large-scale lexicon SAMA (Graff et al., 2009) containing 36, 935 nominal lemmas.
Ourresulting lexicon contains 26, 486 entries : 4, 712 TUN nouns and 10, 647 MSA nouns.?
The union of these resources containing 40, 172 nominal lemmas.
Using this resource, a lexiconmade of 39, 793 was obtained : 5, 017 TUN nouns and 14, 804 MSA nouns.
All results are given insection 4.4 EvaluationIn order to evaluate the resource produced, we used a Tunisian corpus made of 800 sentences.
In orderto cover most spoken TUN varieties, the data was obtained from several sources: TV series, politicaldebates, and a transcribed theater play (Dhouib, 2007).
Once manually tokenized and annotated withmorphological information (lemma and part-of-speech tag), the corpus contains 6, 123 tokens: 53.8%(3, 295) of them are nouns, among which 52% are deverbals.We have divided the evaluation corpus into two different sets : a development corpus contaning 300TUN sentences and a test corpus with 500 sentences.Two metrics have been used to evaluate the deverbal lexicon produced.
The first one is coverage,which is the part of the deverbal types of the evaluation corpus that are present in the lexicon.
Thesecond one is ambiguity which is the average number of target deverbals for a source deverbal.There are two sources of ambiguity:3The second and the third root radical are identical.98?
The verbal lexicon can associate for one input verb many target verbs, for example the TUN verb????
m??
matches with two different MSA verbs ????
m??
?to walk?
and I.?X ?hb ?to go?.
Theambiguity is more important in the TUN ?
MSA sense.
On average, a TUN pair corresponds to1.78 MSA pairs, 1.11 in the opposite direction.
The maximum ambiguity is equal to four in theMSA?
TUN direction and sixteen in the opposite direction.?
the TUN-MSA deverbal table may define several patterns for a deverbal noun as shown in table 2.The evaluation4of the deverbal lexicon on the test set is displayed in Table 3.
The table shows that,without filtering the lexicon coverage is equal to 67.23%.
Ambiguity (in the TUN?MSA direction) isequal to 12.58, which means that, on average, for a TUN deverbal, 12.58 MSA deverbals are produced.After filtering using AFP corpus, coverage drops to 60.04% and ambiguity to 6.99.
Filtering with theSAMA lexicon yields a coverage of 62.66% and an ambiguity of 7.24.
Finally, filtering using AFP ?SAMA, the coverage reaches 65.67% and the whith an ambiguity of 7.35.ambiguity ratefiltering method number of entries coverage MSA?TUN TUN?MSAnone 173,407 67.23 7.65 12.58AFP 17,896 60.04 2.36 6.99SAMA 33,271 63.89 3.45 7.24AFP ?
SAMA 35,792 65.67 2.59 7.35Table 3: Results on test setAs in the verbal lexicon, switching from TUN to MSA is more ambigous than the inverse direction.Ambiguity rates attests that MSA is lexically richer than TUN.
The filtering step helps to significantlydecrease ambiguity, but it also decreases coverage!
The best result is the union of AFP?SAMA, whichenables us to obtain the best trade-off.Table 4 summarizes the coverage and the ambiguity rate of the deverbal lexicon in the developmentand the test sets respectively :ambiguity ratefiltering method number of entries coverage MSA?TUN TUN?MSAnone 173,407 66.12 7.65 12.58AFP 17,896 59.23 2.36 6.99SAMA 33,271 62.66 3.45 7.24AFP ?
SAMA 35,79 64.59 2.59 7.35Table 4: Results in the development setWe have carried out an error analysis on the automatically generated lexical entries.
There are threemajor causes that can explain a missing target deverbal:1.
Absence of the corresponding verb in the verbal lexicon: nouns deriving from a verb that is absentfrom the verb lexicon are not produced in the deverbal lexicon.2.
Missing entries in the TUN-MSA deverbal table3.
Missing morphological and orthographic rules.In order to estimate the part of missing deverbals that is due to lack of coverage of the verbal lexicon,we have added verbs that derive missing deverbals of the development corpus.
92 verbal entries havebeen added.
Table 5 shows results of coverage and ambiguity on the development set.
This result,although artificial allows to compute an upper bound that can be attained with a more complete verballexicon.As one can see in Table 5, coverage jumps from 66.12% to 87.33% before filtering and from 64.59%to 84.16% after filtering using AFP ?
SAMA.
The ambiguity rate increases slightly.4In this paper, we don?t use precision and recall measures because of the small size of the reference corpus.99ambiguity ratefiltering method number of entries coverage MSA?TUN TUN?MSAnone 195,917 87.33 7.93 12.86AFP 20,130 81.46 2.24 7.17SAMA 36,935 82.97 3.67 8.03AFP ?

SAMA 39, 763 71.18 2.86 8.15Table 6: Results in the test set after enriching the verbal lexiconAs shown in table 6, enriching the verbal lexicon improves significantly the coverage of the deverballexicon on the test set.
In fact, it rises from 67% to 73% before filtering and from 65% to 71% afterfiltering using AFP?SAMA, whereas ambiguity remains stable.5 Root lexicon and pattern correspondance tableThe previous section shows that a large portion of errors came from the lack of coverage of the verballexicon.
By adding 92 verbal entries, the coverage jumps by about 6%.
Among these 92 entries, therewere 28 inexistent roots but for the 64 remaining, the root was already present in the verbal lexicon, wehave just added new patterns to the roots (as the pair did not exist).Sebsequently, we have divided the verbal lexicon into two independant resources : a root lexicon anda verbal pattern correspondance table.The root lexicon is made of pairs of the form (rMSA, rTUN), where rMSAis an MSA root and rTUNis a TUN root.
The root lexicon contains 1,357 entries.
The MSA side contains 1,068 distinct rootsand the TUN side 665 ones.
523 entries are composed of the same root on both sides.
As in the verballexicon, the ambiguity is higher in the TUN?
MSA direction.
On average, a TUN root is paired with2.07 MSA roots.
In the opposite direction, 1.27 roots.The verbal pattern correspondance table indicates, for a pattern in MSA or TUN, the most frequentcorresponding pattern on the other side.In this approach, the target pattern is selected by a lookup in the verbal pattern correspondance tablebut the target roots are selected by a root lexicon lookup.
For each source root, we have combined itwith all the nominal patterns corresponding to each verbal pattern.
The target deverbal is made of thetarget root given by the lexicon root and the target nominal pattern depends on the target verbal patternindicated in the verbal pattern correspondance table as shown in figure 2.Results of this experiment on the test corpus show that using this method increase greatly the coverage.Although it also raises the number of generated entries and subsequently ambiguity.100MSA TUNROOT LEXICONDEVERBAL NOUNS LEXICONMSA TUNVRB PAT CORR TBLDEV.

Ourmethod aims to extend an existing TUN verbal lexicon using a table of deverbal patterns to automaticallygenerate pairs of TUN and MSA deverbal nouns.
Several MSA resources were used to filter wrong pairsgenerated.
The lexicon was evaluated using two metrics: coverage and ambiguity.The coverage given by our lexicon is about 71%.
Ambiguity is slightly high in TUN?MSA direction.It reaches 8.15.
A contextual disambiguation process is therefore necessary for such a process to be ofpractical use.In future work, we plan to include this lexicon into a system of translation from TUN to an approxi-mative form of MSA which will be parsed using an MSA parser.ReferencesMustafa Al-Ghulayaini.
