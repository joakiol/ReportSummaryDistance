Discourse dependency structures as constrained DAGsLaurence DanlosTALANA/ LATTICEUniversite?
Paris 7Laurence.Danlos@linguist.jussieu.frAbstractI show that the semantic structure for dis-courses, understood as a dependency represen-tation, can be mathematically characterized asDAGs, but these DAGs present heavy structuralconstraints.
The argumentation is based on asimple case, i.e.
discourses with three clausesand two discourse connectives.
I show thatonly four types of DAGs are needed for thesediscourses.1 IntroductionWithin a multi-level approach to discourse processing,this paper focuses on the semantic level.
This level re-flects the discourse structure (how things are said, howthe discourse is rhetorically organized).
This structureplays an important role, e.g., it constrains both anaphoraresolution and the attachment of incoming propositionsin understanding.
I assume that the informational contentlevel (what is said) is based on first order logic.A nice tool for the semantic level is dependencygraphs.
This is what is adopted in RST (rhetorical struc-tures correspond roughly to dependency structures), butit is not the case in SDRT1: discourse structures, calledSDRSs, are represented as boxes.
Nevertheless, it is easyto translate the conditions of an SDRS into a dependencygraph (Section 2.1).Our goal in this paper is to determine to which mathe-matical object dependency structures for discourses cor-respond.
In RST, it is a basic principle that this object is atree.
In SDRT, the issue is not discussed.
I will show thatthis object is an ordered directed acyclic graph (DAG),1SDRT stands for Segmented Discourse Representation The-ory (Asher, 1993) (Asher and Lascarides, 2003).
It is an ex-tension of DRT, Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp andReyle, 1993).
(S)DRS stands for (Segmented) Discourse Repre-sentation Structure.
RST stands for Rhetorical Structure Theory(Mann and Thompson, 1987).which may be not tree shaped.
Some authors, e.g.
(Bate-man, 1999) and (Blackburn and Gardent, 1998), have al-ready brought forward discourse structures which are nottree shaped.
However nobody says explicitly that dis-course dependency structures are DAGs considering seri-ously all the consequences of this claim2.Our argumentation is based on one of the simplestcases of discourses, namely discourses of type S1 ConnaS2 Connb S3 with two discourse connectives (Conna/b)and three clauses (Si).
A discourse connective Conn canbe either a subordinating or coordinating conjunction ora discourse adverbial.
It denotes a discourse relation R,a predicate with two arguments.
I will show (Section 3)that they are topologically only four types of DAGs forthese discourses.
This allows us to state that DAGs forthese discourses are not arbitrary: they satisfy structuralconstraints (Section 5).
I stipulate that this result can beextrapolated to discourses in which sentences are sim-ply juxtaposed without discourse connective.
It can alsobe foreseen that dependency structures for more complexdiscourses (e.g.
discourses with more than three clauses)are also constrained DAGs.This can be seen as an important result since many au-thors in the discourse community hang on trees as dis-course structures, even if it means to use artificial treesas shown in Section 2.4.
They reject DAGs becausethey view them as completely unconstrained (except theacyclicity constraint) and so as unusable in discourse pro-cessing.
This is truly not the case.
Semantic dependencystructures for discourses are ordered DAGs but these DAGspresent heavy structural constraints, which can help usto cut down the number of possibilities when processingdiscourses (although this issue is not discussed here).Before getting to the heart of the matter, let us givesome preliminaries.2For example, (Blackburn and Gardent, 1998) exhibits anexample the structure of which is a ?re-entrant graph?, see (6c).However, in (Duchier and Gardent, 2001), the semantic repre-sentations of discourses are always tree shaped.2 Preliminaries2.1 Translation of an SDRS into a DAGFormally, an SDRS is is a couple of sets ?U,Con?.
U isa set of labels of DRS or SDRS which may be viewed as?speech act discourse referents?.
Con is a set of condi-tions on labels of the form:?
pi : K, where pi is a label from U and K is a (S)DRS(labelling);?
R(pii, pij), where pii and pij are labels and R a dis-course relation (structuring).The set of conditions can be translated into a depen-dency graph by applying the following rules.?
A condition R(pii, pij) is translated as a binary tree,the root of which is R, the ordered leaves are pii andpij .
pii is the first argument of R (it corresponds gen-erally to the ?nucleus?
in RST), pij its second argu-ment (it corresponds generally to the ?satellite?
inRST).?
A condition pi : K in which K is a SDRS leads toa sub-graph obtained by translating recursively theconditions in K, this sub-graph is labeled pi.?
A condition pi : K in whick K is a DRS is simplytranslated as pi.Figures 1 and 2 give examples of this translation mech-anism.2.2 Linear orderSubordinate conjunctions (noted as Conj) are the onlydiscourse connectives which allow us to invert the orderof the sentences: a subordinate clause can be postposed(the linear order is then the ?canonical?
one S1 Conj (,)S2) or preposed (then the non canonical order is Conj S2,S1).
Following works in MTT3, a trace of the linear or-der can be recorded in a semantic dependency represen-tation, however it should not affect its structure.
Fromthis principle, the position of subordinate clauses shouldnot affect semantic structures.
That is to say that S1 ConjS2 and Conj S2, S1 are both represented as R(pi1, pi2) inwhich pii is the semantic representation of Si.What happens for a sentence with two subordinateclauses?
Establishing the canonical order with only post-posed subordinate clauses may generate ambiguities: forexample, a sentence X of the type Conja S1, S2 ConjbS3, with a preposed subordinate clause and a postposedone, corresponds, in the canonical order, either to Y1 =S2 Conja S1 Conjb S3 or to Y2 = S2 Conjb S3 Conja S1.3MTT stands for Meaning to Text Theory, a dependency for-malism for sentences (Mel?cuk, 2001).In (Danlos, 2003), I have shown, using LTAG as a syn-tactic formalism, that X receives two syntactic analyseswhich allow us to compute Y1 and Y2.
From the principlethat the position of subordinate clauses does not affect se-mantic structures (see above), X does not yield any othersemantics than Y1 and Y2, i.e.
the semantics of X is in-cluded in the semantics of Y1 and Y2.As a consequence, our study on the semantics of sen-tences with two subordinate clauses can be limited to thestudy of such sentences in the canonical order.
Since sub-ordinate conjunctions are the only discourse connectiveswhich allow us to invert the order of the sentences, ourstudy on the semantics of discourses with three clausesand two discourse connectives can be limited to dis-courses which satisfy the linear order S1 Conna S2 ConnbS3.2.3 Compositionality principleLet Dn be a DAG with n leaves representing the depen-dency structure of a discourse Dn.
It will be shown thatthe following principle is true: if Dp is a sub-graph ofDn with p leaves, 1 < p < n, then the discourse Dpcorresponding to Dp can be inferred from the discourseDn.
On the other hand, it will be shown that the converseprinciple is not always true, i.e.
if a sub-discourse Dpcan be inferred from Dn, it does not always mean thatthe graph Dp is a sub-graph of Dn.2.4 Interpretation of dependency relations in treesTwo different ways can be used to interpret dependencyrelations in trees: the standard one used in mathematicsand computer science, and the ?nuclearity principle?
putforward in RST (Marcu, 1996).
Let us illustrate themwith the tree in Figure 3.
With the standard interpreta-tion, the first argument (nucleus) of Rc is its left daughter(the tree rooted at Ra), while with the nuclearity prin-ciple, it is pi1 (the leaf which is the first argument (nu-cleus) of Ra).
Similarly, with the standard interpretation,the second argument (satellite) of Ra is its right daughter(the tree rooted at Rb), while with the nuclearity princi-ple, it is pi2 (the leaf which is the first argument (nucleus)of Rb).
To put it in a nutshell, the arguments of a dis-course relation can be intermediary nodes or leaves withthe standard interpretation, while they can only be leaveswith the nuclearity interpretation.I will show (Section 4) that the standard interpretationshould be adopted.
The point I want to make now is thatone could argue that the nuclearity interpretation shouldbe adopted instead, but one should not feel free to useboth interpretations for the same tree.
This is howeverwhat is done by some authors.
For example, in (Webberet al, 2003), the tree in Figure 4 is the discourse structureassociated with (1).
(1) a.
Although John is very generous -b. if you need some money,c.
you only have to ask him for it -d. he?s very hard to find.Let us show that some predicate-argument relations aregiven by the nuclearity interpretation and other ones bythe standard interpretation in their tree.
From (1), (2) canbe inferred.
This is evidence that the arguments of thediscourse relation ?concession?
in their tree are a and d.These predicate-argument dependencies are given by thenuclearity interpretation.
(2) a.
Although John is very generous,d.
he?s very hard to find.From (1), (3) can also be inferred.
This is evidence thatthe arguments of ?elaboration?
in their tree are a and thetree rooted at ?condition?.
These dependencies are givenby the standard interpretation.
(3) a?.
John is very generous -b. if you need some money,c.
you only have to ask him for it.Nevertheless, one should not feel free to use trees rely-ing on a mixed interpretation (the standard and nuclearityones), except if the conditions governing the use of oneor the other interpretation are formally defined4 .
In Sec-tion 4, I will make an attempt to lay down rules on thechoice of one of these two interpretations according tothe ?coordinating or subordinating?
type of discourse re-lations.
However, this enterprise leads to a failure: nogeneral rule can be laid down.
Mixed interpretation fortrees should thus be discarded.
As a consequence, onehas to admit that discourse structures are DAGs, for ex-ample, the DAG in Figure 5 for (1).
This DAG is conformto our compositionality principle: it can be viewed as thefusion of the dependency graphs for (2) and (3), whilethe discourse in (1) can be viewed as the fusion of thediscourses in (2) and (3), with the factorization of John isvery generous which corresponds to the factorization of?a?
in the DAG.3 DAGs for S1 Conna S2 Connb S3It is standardly assumed that the arguments of a discourserelation expressed through a discourse connective aregiven by text units5 which are adjacent to the discourseconnective (Mann and Thompson, 1987), (Duchier andGardent, 2001).
However, there exist counter-examplesto this adjacency principle, see (7) below.
So I make4I thank an anonymous reviewer for drawing my attentionon this point.5A text unit (noted as U ) is either a clause or, recursively, anon discontinuous sequence Ui Conn Uj .a weaker assumption, that I call ?left1-right2 principle?which states the following: the first (resp.
second) ar-gument of a discourse relation expressed through a dis-course connective is given by a text unit which occurson the left (resp.
right) of the discourse connective.
Thisprinciple makes sense only for discourses in the canonicalorder.
Recall (Section 2.2) that our study can be limitedto discourses which satisfy the canonical linear order S1Conna S2 Connb S3.A consequence of the left1-right2 principle in dis-courses of the type S1 Conna S2 Connb S3, is that thefirst argument of Ra is compulsorily pi1, the only text unitwhich occurs on the left of Conna.
On the other hand,its second argument may vary depending on scope.
Morespecifically, it may a priori be:?
either the representation of the whole right hand sideof Conna, i.e.
the semantic representation of the textunit S2 Connb S3.
I call this case ?wide scope?
ofConna or Ra.
It leads to DAG (A) in Figure 66.
Thedependency relations in (A), which is tree shaped,must be interpreted in the standard way: the secondargument of Ra is its right daughter, i.e.
the treerooted at Rb.?
or the representation of one of the two clauses on theright of Conna.
This case leads either to tree (A1) =Ra(pi1, pi2) or to tree (A2) = Ra(pi1, pi3).Similarly, the second argument of Rb is compulsorilypi3, the only text unit on the right of Connb, but depend-ing on the scope of Connb, its first argument may a pri-ori be Ra(pi1, pi2), see (B) in Figure 6, or pi2 in (B1) =Rb(pi2, pi3) or pi1 in (B2) = Rb(pi1, pi3).We are now ready to study the combinatory comingfrom the fusion of DAGs (Ai) and (Bj).
The goal is todistinguish the DAGs which correspond to coherent dis-courses S1 Conna S2 Connb S3 from those which do not(i.e.
which cannot be linguistically realized).A) Graph (A): This graph is linguistically realized in(4a)7.
The wide scope of Conna = because can be seenin the dialogue in (4b-c) in which the answer is BecauseS2 Connb S38.
In conformity with our compositionalityprinciple, (A) includes the sub-graph Rb(pi2, pi3) and S2Connb S3 can be inferred: if (4a) is true, then it is truethat Fred played tuba while Mary was taking a nap.
Thereader will check that the adverbial Conna = therefore in(4d) has also wide scope.6In this figure, as well as in other subsequent figures, thelabel for the sub-graph is omitted.7To indicate that it is stressed when spoken, the word whileis written in capital letters in (4).8When while is not stressed, the question in (4b) may begiven as answer only Because S2.
The interpretation of (4a)corresponds then to DAG (C) in Figure 6.
(4) a. Mary is in a bad mood because Fred played tubaWHILE she was taking a nap.b.
- Why is Mary in a bad mood?c.
- Because Fred played tuba WHILE she was tak-ing a nap.d.
Fred wanted to bother Mary.
Therefore, heplayed tuba WHILE she was taking a nap.B) Graph (B): This graph is linguistically realized in(5a).
The wide scope of Connb = in order that/to canbe seen in the dialogue in (5b-c) in which the questionis Why S1 Connb S2?
In conformity with our composi-tionality principle, (B) includes the sub-graph Ra(pi1, pi2)and S1 Connb S2 can be inferred from (5a).
The adver-bial Connb = therefore in (5d) has also wide scope.
(5) a. Fred played tuba WHILE Mary was taking a napin order to bother her.9b.
- Why did Fred play tuba WHILE Mary was tak-ing a nap?c.
- In order to bother her.d.
Fred played tuba WHILE Mary was taking a nap.Therefore, she is in a bad mood.C) Graphs (A1) and (B1): The fusion of (A1) and(B1) leads to DAG (C) in Figure 6.
This DAG is not treeshaped: pi2 has two parents.
It is linguistically realized in(6a), in which S2 is said to be ?factorized?
since both S1Conna S2 = Mary is in a bad mood because her son is illand S2 Connb S3 = Her son is ill.
Specifically, he has anattack of bronchitis can be inferred from (6a), which is inconformity with our compositionality principle since (C)includes both (A1) = Ra(pi1, pi2) and (B1) = Rb(pi2, pi3).A similar situation is observed in (6b) and (6c).
(6) a. Mary is in a bad mood because her son is ill.Specifically, he has an attack of bronchitis.b.
Fred played tuba.
Next he prepared a pizza toplease Mary.c.
Fred was in a foul humor because he hadn?tslept well that night because his electric blankethadn?t worked.10D) Graphs (A1) and (B2): The fusion of (A1) and(B2) leads to DAG (D) in Figure 6.
This DAG is not treeshaped: pi1 has two parents.
It is linguistically realizedin (7a), in which S1 is said to be ?factorized?
since bothS1 Conna S2 = Fred prepared a pizza to please Mary andS1 Connb S3 = Fred prepared a pizza.
Next he took a napcan be inferred, in conformity with our compositionalityprinciple.
A similar situation is observed in (7b) and (7c).9When while is not stressed, the interpretation of (5a) maycorrespond to DAG (D) in Figure 6.10This discourse is a modified version (including discourseconnectives) of an example taken in (Blackburn and Gardent,1998).
These authors acknowledged that the structure of thisdiscourse is a ?re-entrant graph?.
(7) a. Fred prepared a pizza to please Mary.
Next, hetook a nap.b.
Fred prepared a pizza, while it was raining, be-fore taking a walk.c.
Fred is ill. More specifically, he has an attack ofbronchitis.
Therefore, Mary is in a bad mood.In discourses analyzed as (D), S3 is linked to S1 (whichis not adjacent) and not to S2 (which is adjacent).
There-fore, these discourses are counter-examples to the adja-cency principle adopted in RST.The DAG (D) exhibits crossing dependencies and itdoes correspond to coherent discourses.
(D) is thus acounter-example to the stipulation made by (Webber etal., 2003), namely ?discourse structure itself does not ad-mit crossing structural dependencies?11.E) Graphs (A2) and (B1): The fusion of (A2) and(B1) leads to DAG (E) in Figure 7, in which pi3 has twoparents.
I cannot find any discourse corresponding to (E),i.e.
with S3 factorized, although I wrote down all possibleexamples I could think of.
Laurence Delort, who workson (French) corpus neither.
I cannot prove that somethingdoes not exist, I can just stipulate it.
However there issome evidence, coming from syntax, which supports mystipulation when Conna and Connb are both subordinat-ing conjunctions (Conj).
Namely, no standard syntacticanalysis of sentences of the type S1 Conja S2 Conjb S3can lead, in a compositional way, to an interpretation inwhich S3 is factorized12.
As I see no reason to make adifference between subordinating conjunctions and otherdiscourse connectives at the semantic level (see note 11),I extrapolate this result to other discourse connectives.F) Graphs (A2) and (B2): The fusion of (A2) and(B2) leads to DAG (F) in Figure 7.
This graph cannotrepresent a discourse S1 Conna S2 Connb S3 since it doesnot include pi2.So far, we have examined only cases where a discourserelation has two arguments.
It remains to examine what iscalled ?multi satellite or nucleus cases?
in RST, in whicha discourse relation is supposed to have more than twoarguments.G) Graphs (A1), (A2) and (B2): The fusion of (A1),(A2) and (B2) leads to DAG (G) in Figure 7.
This DAGcould be said to be linguistically realized in (8a): since11Among discourse connectives, (Webber et al, 2003) dis-tinguish ?structural connectives?
(e.g.
subordinating conjunc-tions) from discourse adverbials including then, also, otherwise,.
.
.
.
They argue that discourse adverbials do admit crossing ofpredicate-argument dependencies, while structural connectivesdo not.
I don?t make any distinction between discourse connec-tives at the semantic level, but I emphasize that (7b) comprisesonly structural connectives (subordinating conjunctions) and itsstructure exhibits crossing structural dependencies.12Recall that I feel entitled to make this claim because I havestudied in detail the syntactic analyses of sentences of the typeS1 Conja S2 Conjb S3 in (Danlos, 2003).both S1 Conna S2 and S1 Conna S3 can be inferred from(8a), one may be willing to lay down both Ra(pi1, pi2) andRa(pi1, pi3), i.e.
to consider (8a) as a multi-satellite casewith Ra = Elaboration.
Rb = Narration links pi2 and pi3.The following question arises: is Rb in a dependency rela-tion with Ra?
It is hard to give an answer for (8a).
How-ever the answer seems positive for (8b), which could alsobe analyzed as a multi-satellite case with Ra = Explana-tion.
Rb = Joint links pi2 and pi3.
This leads to DAG (G?
)in Figure 7.
However, consider (8c) which differs from(8b) only by the use of or instead of and.
Graphs (G)or (G?)
would not do justice to (8c): neither Ra(pi1, pi2)nor Ra(pi1, pi3) can be laid down.
(8c) can only be rep-resented as DAG (A) with Ra = Explanation and Rb =Disjunction.
(8) a.
Guy experienced a lovely evening last night.More specifically, he had a fantastic meal.
Nexthe won a dancing competition.13b.
Mary is in a bad mood because she had?nt sleptwell and it is raining.c.
Mary is in a bad mood because she had?nt sleptwell or it is raining.It seems clear that (8b) and (8c) should be representedat the semantic level as the very same graph.
This graphcan only be (A), which is the only possibility for (8c).
Forthe sake of homogeneity and compatibility with SDRT,(8a) should also be represented as (A)14.
Recall more-over that (4a) with wide scope of Conna is also repre-sented as (A).
All in all, (A) happens to be a semanticstructure which is shared by discourses whose informa-tional content shows quite different relations between theeventualities at stake.
Is it a problem?
I would say no, be-cause, from (A), semantic to content rules, based on thevalues of Ra and Rb, can make the difference: they cancompute the following (simplified) logical forms, whichshow that the discourses in (8) and (4a) do not have thesame type of informational content as far as the relationsbetween eventualities are concerned, althoug they sharethe same (dependency) semantic structure:?
for (8a) with Ra = Elaboration and Rb = Narration:e1 ?
e2 ?
e3 ?
precede(e2, e3)?
subevent(e1, e2) ?
subevent(e1, e3)?
for (8b) with Ra = Explanation and Rb = Joint: e1 ?e2 ?
e3 ?
cause(e1, and(e2, e3))?
e1 ?
e2 ?
e3 ?
cause(e1, e2) ?
cause(e1, e3)13This discourse is a modified version (including discourseconnectives) of an example taken in (Asher and Lascarides,2003).14The (A) analysis is the translation of the SDRS proposedby (Asher and Lascarides, 2003) for (8a), namely the SDRS inFigure 1 with Ra = Elaboration and Rb = Narration.
pi1 is con-sidered as the ?topic?
(common theme) for pi2 and pi3.?
for (8c) with Ra = Explanation and Rb = Disjunc-tion: e1 ?
e2 ?
e3 ?
cause(e1, or(e2, e3))?
e1 ?
e2 ?
e3 ?
(cause(e1, e2) ?
cause(e1, e3))?
for (4a) with Ra = Explanation and Rb = Circum-stances: e1 ?
e2 ?
e3 ?
overlap(e2, e3)?
cause(e1, overlap(e2, e3))We have touched here a crucial question in discourseprocessing (within a multi-level approach): to what ex-tent should the semantic (dependency) level (how thingsare said) echo the informational content level (what issaid)?
I don?t pretend to give a general answer to thisfundamental question.
However we have seen that thesame semantic dependency structure (or SDRS) can leadto quite different informational contents according to thevalues of the discourse relations at stake.
What is calledmulti-satellite case in RST, e.g.
(8a) or (8b), leads to alogical form in which the same eventuality variable, heree1, occurs conjunctively multi-times as the argument ofthe same predicate, e.g.
preda(e1, e2) ?
preda(e1, e3)with preda = subevent in (8a) and preda = cause in(8b).
It is unnecessary to represent such a case at the se-mantic level trough a predicate - a discourse relation -with more than two arguments.
The multi-satelitte anal-ysis in RST comes from the following principle: if a sub-discourse Dp can be inferred from a discouse Dn, with1 < p < n, then the graph Dp must be a sub-graph ofDn.
This principle is simply wrong.
On the other hand,the converse implication is true.H) Graphs (A1), (B1) and (B2): The fusion of (A1),(B1) and (B2) leads to a DAG which could be said to belinguistically realized in (9).
This discourse allows us toinfer both S1 Connb S3 and S2 Connb S3.
So it would beclassified as a multi-nucleus case in RST.
However, bythe same argumentation as previously, it should be repre-sented as (B).
(9) Fred washed the dishes and Guy cleaned up the bath-room, while Mary was taking a nap.I) Graphs (A1), (A2) and (B2): The fusion of thesegraphs lead to DAG (I) in Figure 8.
I cannot find anyexample corresponding to this DAG.J) Graphs (A2), (B1) and (B2): Along the same lines,the fusion of these graphs lead to a DAG for which I can-not find any instance.No other fusion of graphs (Ai) and (Bj) leads to a DAGwhich corresponds to a coherent discourse.
So we havearrived at the following result:The dependency structure of a discourse S1Conna S2 Connb S3 is one of the four DAGs(A), (B), (C) and (D).
(A) and (B), which aretree shaped, cover wide scope cases (and multisatellite or nucleus cases in RST).
(C) and (D),which are not tree shaped, cover multi parentcases (factorization of a sentence).
(D) exhibitscrossing dependencies.Before commenting on this result, let us come back tothe interpretation of dependency relations in trees.4 Interpretation of dependency relations intrees (concluding episode)First, let us underline the following point.
Interpretingtree shaped graphs (A) and (B) with the nuclearity princi-ple amounts to interpreting (A) as (C), and (B) as (D)15.But then, cases with wide scope are not taken into ac-count, which is unacceptable.
Therefore, the standard in-terpretation of dependency relations in a tree is needed.Next, the following question arises: is it possible tostate that the dependency relations in a tree should becomputed sometimes by the standard interpretation andsome other times by the nuclearity one?
In the tree (B),this question is instantiated in the following way: shouldthe first argument of Rb be given sometimes by the stan-dard interpretation (it is then the tree rooted at Ra) andsome other times by the nuclearity principle (it is thenpi1, and (B) is equivalent to (D))16?
An answer to thisquestion is sound only if it is possible to define formally?sometimes?.
The only sound answer consists in stat-ing that there exist two types of discourse relations: thedependency relations are computed with the standard in-terpretation for the first type, and computed with the nu-clearity interpretation for the second one.
The only typesof discourse relations which have been put forward upto now are the ?coordinating and subordinating?
types(Hobbs, 1979), (Asher and Lascarides, 2003), (Asher andVieu, 2003).
Laurence Delort in (Delort, 2004) has ex-amined, in the framework of SDRT, my DAGs (A)-(D) instudying for each relation Ra or Rb if it could be of thecoordinating and/or subordinating type.
Her results aresummarized in Table 1.
This table shows that (B) is pos-sible only when Ra is coordinating and (D) only whenRa is subordinating (in both cases, Rb can be equally co-ordinating or subordinating).
Therefore, it is possible tolay down the following rule: the dependency relations inthe tree (B) are computed with the standard interpretationwhen Ra is coordinating, and with the nuclearity inter-pretation when Ra is subordinating.However, let us examine the situation for the tree (A).From Table 1, the reader can check that no rule can belaid down for the dependency relations in (A) when Rb iscoordinating: they can be computed with either the stan-dard or the nuclearity interpretation.
These two cases are15With the nuclearity principle, the second argument of Ra in(A) is pi2, and the first argument of Rb in (B) is pi1.16For the other dependency relations in (B), both interpreta-tions give the same result.illustrated in (10) with Ra = Contrast and Rb = Narration:(10a) should be analyzed with the standard interpretationof (A) with wide scope of Conna, while (10b) should beanalyzed with the nuclearity interpretation of (A), i.e.
as(C) with S2 factorized.

Fred has made no domestic chore this morn-ing.
However, this afternoon, he washed up thedishes.
Next he went to see a movie.In conclusion, a mixed interpretation for trees mustbe discarded: the coordinating or subordinating type ofdiscourse relations does not allow us to choose betweenthe standard and nuclearity interpretations.
As a conse-quence, since the standard interpretation is needed forwide scope cases, the nuclearity principle should be dis-carded.5 Analysis of the result and conclusionThe result I arrived at does not take into account the dis-course connectives / relations at stake.
However, for agiven pair of connectives, it may happen that only someof the DAGs among (A)-(D) are observed.
For example,if Conna is an adverbial and Connb a subordinate con-junction, then (B) with wide scope of Rb should be ex-cluded.
On the top of part of speech considerations, thelexical value of each connective may exclude some ofthese DAGs.
Finally, the distinction between coordinat-ing and subordinating discourse relations must be takeninto account.
Table 1 from (Delort, 2004) presented as inTable 2 shows that a given DAG among (A)-(D) never cor-responds to the 2?2 = 4 possibilities given by the combi-natory Ra/b coordinating or subordinating discourse rela-tion.To put it in a nutshell, there is a maximum of four or-dered DAGs representing the semantic structures of dis-courses S1 Conna S2 Connb S3.
I stipulate that this resultcan be extrapolated to cases where sentences are simplyjuxtaposed without discourse connective.It can be considered that there is only a few DAGs cor-responding to coherent discourses with three clauses17.First, recall that the left1-right2 principle (Section 3) dis-cards right away a number of DAGs, for example (K) inFigure 8 (in (K), Ra is not the mother of pi1).
Secondly,among the DAGs which satisfy the left1-right2 principle,some are not instantiated, e.g.
(E), and also (F).
A look17In RST, there are only 2 trees (2 is the number of binarytrees with 3 leaves), namely trees (A) and (B), which are sup-posed to be interpreted with the nuclearity principle (being sointerpreted as (B) and (D) respectively).
We have seen that thisis too restrictive: wide scope cases are not taken into account.on the topology of the ordered DAGs (A)-(D) allows usto bring forward this other structural constraint: Ra must?left-dominate?
pi2.
The definition of left-dominance ina tree is the following (Danlos, 2003): a node X left-dominates a node Y iff Y is a daughter of X (immediatedominance) or there exists a daughter Z of X such thatY belongs to the left-frontier of the tree rooted at Z. Forexample, Ra left-dominates pi1, Rb and pi2 in (A), whileRb left-dominates Ra, pi1 and pi3 in (B)18.Let us here examine the consequences of this left-dominance constraint in non formal terms.
Ra must bethe mother of pi1 and must left-dominate pi2.
This meansthat Ra establishes some semantic link between S1 andS219.
This result may sound trivial on psycho-linguisiticsgrounds: what would be a discourse in which the secondclause is not linked at all to the first one?20 It has thefollowing consequence: the semantic representation of adiscourse with four clauses and three discourse connec-tives cannot be DAG (L) in Figure 8.
In (L), Ra does notleft-dominate pi2, or informally, there is no link betweenS1 and S2.
(L) includes two crossing dependencies.I have just half-opened the door towards an extensionof this study to discourses with more than three clauses.I stipulate that the conclusion of this forthcoming studywill be the same.
Namely, semantic dependency struc-tures for discourses are ordered DAGs which satisfy heavystructural constraints, which can help us to cut down thenumber of possibilities when processing discourses.AcknowledgementsI want to thank Laura Kallmeyer for her many valuablecomments.ReferencesNicholas Asher and Alex Lascarides.

forth-coming.18Left-dominance is a notion more restrictive than domi-nance (e.g.
Ra dominates pi1, Rb, pi2 and also pi3 in (A)) andless restrictive than the nuclearity principle (e.g.
by this princi-ple, Ra dominates only the leaves pi1, and pi2 in (A)).19This result can be seen as a weaker version of the adjacencyprinciple for the first two clauses of a discourse.20The link between the first two clauses can be given by athird sentence, as in (11) in which S3 establishes a joint linkbetween S1 and S2 through its plural subject.
The DAG for (11)is (B) with Ra = Joint and Rb = Comment.
