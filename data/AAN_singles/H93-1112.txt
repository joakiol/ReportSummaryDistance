The project approach is to use improvedrepresentations of text and information needs in theframework of a probabilistic inference net model of re-trieval.In this project, retrieval (and routing) is viewed as aprobabilistic inference process which "compares" textrepresentations based on different forms of linguisticand statistical evidence to representations of informa-tion needs based on similar evidence from natural an-guage queries and user interaction.
New techniques forlearning (relevance feedback) and extracting term rela-tionships from text are also being studied.Some of the specific research issues we are addressing aremorphological analysis in English and Japanese, wordsense disambiguation i  English, the use of phrases andother syntactic structure in English and Japanese, theuse of special purpose recognizers in representing doc-uments and queries, analysing natural anguage queriesto build structured representations of information eeds,learning techniques appropriate for routing and struc-tured queries, probability estimation techniques for in-dexing, and techniques for automatically building andusing thesauri.
A rctricval system based on the infer-ence net approach, INQUERY, has been built for study-ing these issues and distribution.RECENT RESULTSThe results generated in the TIPSTER and TRECevaluations have been generally successful in that theprobabilistic approach implemented in INQUERY hasachieved the highest average levels of precision.
We havealso found that capturing a good description of the in-formation eed, either automatically or with some sim-ple user input, has a significant impact on effectiveness.In particular, describing paragraph-level structure be-tween concepts hasbeen effective, whereas phrase-levelstructure has (somewhat surprisingly) only resulted insmall improvements.
Special purpose recognizers, suchas for company names, have resulted in small improve-ments.
Early experiments with automatic expansion ofthe queries using associated words found through analy-sis of the corpus have begun to show promise.
Relevancefeedback techniques used for the routing situation wherethere are many previous relevance judgements have ad-vanced to the point where the average performance ofthe fully automatically generated queries can competewith the best manually-adjusted queries.
With regard toJapanese, we have found that retrieval using character-based indexing of documents combined with word-basedsegmentation of the queries results in performance thatis as good as word-based indexing of the documents.This is significant since character-based indexing is muchmore efficient han current word segmenters.418
