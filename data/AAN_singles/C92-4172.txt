Wecharacterize them as adjuncts to nouns, and formal-ize them in terms of constraints among grammaticalfeatures.
Furthermore, we claim that there is a con-straint on the number of slash elements and show thesupporting facts.1 IntroductionThis paper discusses the formalization of relativeclauses in Japanese based on JPSG (Japanese PhraseStructure Grammar)\[I, 2\], which is a constraint-based grammar formalism like tlPSG(Head-drivenPhrase Structure Grammar)\[7, 8\].
We have workedon JPSG with Prof. Gunji, and also have developeda parser based on an efficient mechanism for dealingwith constraints\[3, 4, 10\] to show that JPSG is effec-tive even for the computational processing of naturallanguage.In the next section, we briefly introduce JPSG the-ory.
Following a simple characterization f relativeclauses in Japanese language in section 3, we disscussthe variety of acceptability in secton 4, and describeits formalization in terms of constraints among thegrammatical features in section 5.
And in section 6we will claim that there is a constraint on tile numberof slash elements and show tile supporting facts.2 Bas ics  of  J PSGThis section describes a brief introduction to JPSG,which is a grammar formalism originally for theJapanese language.
As with IIPSG, JPSG is featurebased and constraint based grammar.2.1 FeaturesGrammatical categories are represented assets of fea-tures.
We list the features used in this paper.
(1) Features used in this paperpos (part of speech) same ms in IIPSG.gr (grammatical relation) takes either subj, obj, oriobj as the value.subcat  (subcategorization) designates the set of cat-egories (complements) that a particular category(head) requires.
Though we have to distingushtwo types of complements (is., agglutinated ornot) in Japanese, for simplicity, we assume thatsubeat  designates tile both types of comple-ments.dep (dependent) designates the category that a par-ticular category (adjunct) modifies.core roughly corresponds to CAT feature in tlPSG\[8\].
Tim value is a set of features including sub-cat feature and so-called head features uch aspos, gr and dep.s lash designates a syntactic gap within the gram-matical category involved.sere (semantics) designates the semantic representa-tion of the grammatical category involved.In this paper, categories are designated by a leftsquare bracket ("\[') followed by an indefinite num-ber of feature specifications (a feature name followedby its value) separated by commas(",") followed bya right square bracket ("1").
When the value is nullor not relevant, the entire feature specification can beomitted.
The sharing structure is indicated by vari-ables such as X, Y,..., which is distinguished by aninitial capital etter as in programming language Pro-log.
Finally, a category of the form \[core {pos c,... } .
.
.
.
.
sere s\] is often abbreviated as el...\]:s.Because grammatical relations play no role in or-dering complements in Japanese, we assume only abinary-branching phrase structure schema s seeu inthe next subsection.2.2 The Phrase  S t ruc ture  Schema and Gram-mat lca l  P r inc ip lesWe are assuming three basic phrase structure schemafor Japanese: complementation, adjunclion, and co-ACTES DE COLING.92, NANTES.

The above struc-tures are uniquely characterized by the features.
Forexample, the head in the complements( ion structureshould have subeat  feature one of whose value is uni-tied with the complement, C.Furthermore, we assume the following grammart i -cal principles, which are applied to every structures:Head Feature  P r inc ip le :  same as in III)SG.

Weassume that s lash anti some other features arebinding features.S lash  feature aud Binding Feature Principle playa crucial role in describing so-called long distance de-pendency phenomena.
We will discuss them in detailin the following sections.3 Re la t ive  C lauses  in  JapaneseTraditionally the relative clause in Japanese has beenconsidered as a kind of so-called ren-1ai syusyoku setu'the clause for modifying noun'.
Because it is char-aeterized as an embedded sentence for modifying thehead noun in the structure \[s .
.
.
\]N, it can be consid-ered ~.s an adjunct to the head noun.In this paper,  we adopt this idea.
Thus,  the struc-ture of relative clause-head noun construction canbe described as shown in Figure 1, where the leftdaughter category is a relative clause, and the rightdaughter category is a head noun.
The fact that theleft daughter category has dep  feature whose valuel For example, when the left daughter and the head daughterhave { A } and { B } as their slash feature value respectively,the value of slash of the mother will he { A, B } in most cases.llowever, in cane that A can be unifiable with B, the result canbe { A ).
Furthermore, in case that A (or B I is bound in thelocal brnaaching stnmture (as in Figure 4), the result will be {n}(o~{A }).\[ core  tl \]where II = {pos n}Figure 1: Relative Clause as Adjuncti1\]is unifial)le with the right daughter category, charac-terizes the left daughter (is.
relative clause) as alladjunct.tlowever, we have to explain where this dep  fea-ture comes from.
In Japanse, a relative clause ha.~a tense form at its end.
Thus we assume that tenseform is categorized as a verb which takes a verb cat-egory as its coinplement, l"urthermore, we assumethat for every tense form (e.g.
-ta and -ru), tbere aretwo different lexieal entries With the same phoueticform, which we call the preaomiual tense form andthe assertive tense form 2.
Tile former type is as-sumed to be the ending form of relative clauses, andhas a non-mall value in dep  feature.
This value isbound with the head noun of the relative clause a4 Types  o f  Re la t ive  C lausesRelative clauses can be classilled into the followingthree types in terms of their structural characteristics(where ?

SS: Simple SentenceThe relative clanse consists of a simple sentence,and the gap plays a role in that sentence, e.g.
(3) \[ Naomi -ga  5 yore -da \ ]  honNOM ACC read PAST book'tile book which Naomi read'2.
ES: Embedded SentenceThe relative clause includes an embedded sen-tence in which the gap plays a role, e.g.

This simplification, how-ever, may be too permissive, because usually in theRC clauses are acceptable only when tile gap's role issubject.5 Formal i za t ionIn this section we will formalize the syntactic struc-ture of the relative clause in Japanese.
First we willformalize the SS type relative clause.
Then we formal-ize the distribution of the s lash feature.
And finally,we examine the other eases, that is, those in whichthe gap is derived in either an embedded sentence ora relative clause.5.1 S imple  Re la t ive  C lauseAs discussed in section 3, a relative clause is regardedas an adjunct.
Thus, the gap should be bound withtile dep  feature value of the prenominal tense cate-gory.As shown in the last section, gaps are not restrictedto subjects or objects.
Optional Adjunct 1 categories('locative','goal' nd 'source') can be a gap.
Thus, forsimplicity, we here assume that Adjunct 1 type rolesare also designated in the value of subcat  feature,core subcat  }dov {hi I:X}\[ /' .

}l core subcat  { \[core l}dep  {n\[ \]:X}whereC= { pos v }subeat  {VII:X} oYFigure 2: Binding of Dep with SubcatFurthermore, we assume that a gap is directlybound with dop feature, instead of being bomtd withan element of s lash which is ill turn bound with dep.We call t~his hypothesis the Direct Binding Hypothe-sis (that is, subcat  element can be directly boundwith dep).
We will discuss tile correctness of thisassumption i  section 6.This relationship is expressed ill tile lexical entryfor pronominal tense category, eg.
~ta, -ru, and -i.The structure is shown ill Figure 2, where tile headdaughter is a pronominal tense category.
For exam-pie, kak 'write' is assumed to take bottt subject andobject complements and have the following lexical en-try as follows:(6) v\[eore {subcat  {p\[gr subj\]:X, p\[gr obj\]:Y}}\]Then, a relative clause kak-ta 'wrote' corresponds tothe following categories:(7) a. v\[eore {subcat  { }, dep  { n\[g .

Tiffsphenomenon is described by using the s lash featureas in tlPSG.
We will characterize the distribution ofs lash in tile following three sections.5.2.1 SLASII INTRODUCTIONLexical entries with non-null value in s lash featureare introduced by tile following lexical rnle: 4Subeat -S lash  Lexica l  Rule:\ [subcat  { p\[\]:X } US\ ]\[subeat S, slash { n\[l:X }\]Tbe number of s lash elements introduced by this rulecan be at most onc, a fact which we explaiu moreprecisely in the next section.4There are some re~trlctions on the application oftiffs rule.For exmnple, an agghttinated complement emmet become aslash value.ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Aour 1992 I 1 0 2 PROC.

lIere, again, we assumethat the number of s lash elements of each categorycarl be at most one.In the RC type relative clause, the gap is inheritedfrom the innermost embedded clause to the outermostrelative clause shown in Figure :Lv\[slash X\]p\[s lash X\] v \ [subcat  {p\[ \]}\]n\[s lash X\] p \ [subcat  {n\[ \]}{n\[\]} \] / NOM sell wellholtbookFigure 3: Exanrple of Slash Inheritance5.2.3 SLASH BINDINGA long-distance inherited gap can be bound with tiledep of tile prenominal tense category, and finallybound with the head nmm of the relative clause asshown in Figure 4 (where only core  features of themother and the head are shown).
For example, ifthe left daughter category corresponds to kak-ta hou-ga yoku ure 'hook which ?
wrote sells well'), anti theright daughter (i.e.
the bead) to the prcnomiaal tenseform -to, then the mother, kak-ta hon-ga yoku ure-ta,will he described as follows:v\[core {dep {n\ [ \ ]  }}\]It should be noted that we do not necessarily needa specific phrase structure rule for the s lash bindingwith tile dep  \[9\], though it may be uatural that weassume to have such a phrase structure rule as shownin Figure 4.5.3 Complex  Re la t ive  C lauseIn both ES and RC type relative clauses, the Bind-ing Feature Principle specifies that a s lash elementwhich is introduced by the Subcat-Slash Lexical Ruleis iuherited and finally bound with the dep value ofthe prenominal tense category in the ontermost rel-ative clause.
Figure 5 shows an example of such astructure.\[.os \]subeat  }dep { X }s lash { X } subcat  \[core C\]dep  { X }Figure 4: Slasil Bindingn\[\]v\[ .

And according to tile DirectBinding Hypothesis which we proposed ill section 5,a subcat  element call he directly bound with the dep.Ilere, we will discuss why this hypothesis is correct.Furthermore, we will show that if we adopt the DirectBinding Hypothesis, the number of slash elements canbe at most one.If we don't accept this hypothesis, the only alter-native is to assume that the gap is bound only withan element of s lash.
That  is, if an element of subcatcannot be bound directly with the value of the de l lthe gap should he initially ill the value of s lash, andshould then be bound with the elenlent of dep.
Wewill call this hypothesis the Indirect B~nding Hypoth-esis (that is, subcat  elenmnt can be indirectly boundwith the dep  through a lexical rule).First consider the following seutence:(9) \[\[ kak - ta \ ]  I .

If we accept he In-direel Binding Hypothesis, the number of slash ele-ments would be at least two, because in the above,every relative clause other than outermost one has atleast two slash elements.However, consider the following strnctures (wberei and j are either 1 or 2, and ?1 and ?2 are assumedto be bound with NI and N2, respectively):(10) a.

Taking Indirect Bind-ing Hypothesis, the number of slash elements for theabove is 3, 3, and 2, respectively.
It follows that interms of tbe number of slash elements, we cannot ex-plain the difference of the acceptability of the abovestructures.Ilowever, we accept the Direct Binding Hypothe-sis, sentence (9) needs only one slash element, andsentences (11) all need at least two.
Thus the DirectBinding Hypothesis i better than the Indirect Bind-ing Hypothesis.
And adopting this hypothesis leadsto the concusion that the number of slash elementsshould be at most one.7 Concluding RemarksWe have described a grammatical formalization ofthe relative clause in Japanese.
Based oil tile JPSGframework, this formalization is characterized interms of constraints, that is, relationships among tilegrammatical features in a phrase structure and in-formation in tile lexicai entries.
In this paper weproposed the Direct Binding Hypothesis, and showedthat the number of slash elements should be at mostone in Japanese.Acknowledgments.
