beAbstractWe pursue two strategies for offline data collection for a temporal question answeringsystem that uses both quantitative methods and fuzzy methods to reason about timeand events.
The first strategy extracts event descriptions from the structured yearentries in the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, yielding clean quantitative temporalinformation about a range of events.
The second strategy mines the web usingpatterns indicating temporal relations between events and times and between events.Web mining leverages the volume of data available on the web to find qualitativetemporal relations between known events and new, related events and to build fuzzytime spans for events for which we lack crisp metric temporal information.1 IntroductionTime structures our world, and the questions we ask reflect that.
Not onlydo we want to know quantitative information?when did some event happenor how long did some state of affairs persist?but we also want qualitativeinformation?what was going on before or during major events, or what hap-pened afterwards.
While the amount of information available to answer suchquestions continues to increase, the temporal information needed is not alwaysfully specified.
No information source is obliged to timestamp every referencedevent, so while evidence for qualitative temporal relations abounds, there isoften no quantitative information to verify it.
Furthermore, many events, suchas the Cold War or the Great Depression, are inherently vague?with gradualbeginnings or endings?or ill-defined aggregations of smaller events.In order for a temporal QA system to be able to make use of such limited,incomplete temporal information, careful consideration must be given both tothe extraction of temporal information it needs and to the temporal reasoningmechanisms it employs.
We are presently at work on a temporal QA systemthat provides access to events extracted from Wikipedia and satellite eventsmined from the web and that models the time span of vague events as fuzzy setsand qualitative temporal relations as fuzzy relations.
In this paper, we focuson the creation of the knowledge base of events and temporal information,which takes place offline, prior to any user interaction.
A separate paper [10]describes the fuzzy reasoning mechanisms the system uses.In ?2 and ?3, we introduce temporal questions and sketch the architec-ture of our temporal QA system.
In ?4, we describe event extraction fromWikipedia, an online encyclopedia.
In ?5, we describe web mining for fuzzyand qualitative temporal information.
Note that the work described here isstill in progress, so while our extraction methods are in use, we are still ex-perimenting with them, and the QA system is not yet complete.2 Temporal questionsThere are a variety of question types that fall under the umbrella of temporalquestions, including questions that ask for times as answers, those that ask fortemporal relations, and those that ask for information restricted to a certaintime period [6].
The degree of explicitness of temporal reference in a temporalquestion also varies significantly: some temporal questions refer explicitly to adate or time, while others refer to times only implicitly, by reference to eventsor states.
Here, we focus on temporally restricted questions, and in particular,those restricted by events, such as these (from the CLEF 2005 QA track):(1) Who played the role of Superman before he was paralyzed?
(2) What disease did many American soldiers get after the Gulf War?The data collection we describe, though, can be used to support the answeringof other types of temporal questions, as well.Temporally restricted questions consist of two parts: the main clause,which indicates the information request, and the temporal restriction, whichis a subordinate clause or PP headed by a temporal preposition or connective,such as before, after, during, etc., which we refer to as temporal signals [7].
Thetemporal signal that connects the two parts of a temporally restricted ques-tion indicates the temporal relation that must hold between the time spansof the restricting event and the requested events.
Since much of the tempo-ral information we have access to regarding events is vague and incomplete,we explore the use of fuzzy temporal reasoning for temporal QA, instead ofthe standard Allen algebra of temporal interval relations [1].
The model weuse is a generalization of Allen?s algebra that is suitable for vague events andrelations.
For crisp events, our reasoning algorithm is equivalent to Allen?spath-consistency algorithm.
For vague events, fuzzy relations can express thata given qualitative relation is only satisfied to a certain degree [11].3 Architecture of a temporal QA systemOur temporal QA system follows a strategy of extracting information likely tobe useful in answering questions?in our case, a knowledge base of events andtemporal relations?in a pre-processing stage, before any questions are asked[3,4].
The system consists of several components: a question analysis module,the knowledge base, and an answer selection module.Question analysis: Since we are focusing on temporal questions in whicha temporal relation restricts the information being queried, our question anal-ysis module must separate the non-temporal part of the question?the actualinformation request?from the temporal restriction.
Our question analysismodule parses the question and extracts phrases headed by temporal signalsas potential temporal restrictions.
It then uses standard pattern-based tech-niques to extract keyword queries and the expected answer type.Knowledge base: The knowledge base (KB) consists of two parts: anXML database containing descriptions of individual events and a temporalrelation network containing inclusion and before/after relations for events inthe KB.
Quantitative temporal information about events (i.e., starting andending dates for crisp events and fuzzy sets for vague ones) is contained in theXML database.
The rest of this paper describes the construction of the KB.Answer selection: To answer a temporally restricted question, we mustfind events that match the non-temporal part of the question and filter outthose that do not satisfy the restriction.
We treat the problem of finding theevents as a retrieval problem, using the keyword queries from question analy-sis, with event descriptions as target documents.
Checking whether an eventsatisfies the restriction is a matter of inferring whether an appropriate qualita-tive temporal relation holds between the event and a time or event matchingthe restriction.
We use IR techniques to find events matching the restriction,and we use both quantitative and fuzzy temporal reasoning to make the infer-ence [10].
From the remaining event descriptions, we use standard techniquesto extract an answer.
Typically, the information request is mapped to a namedentity type by the question analysis module, so appropriate named entities areharvested and scored and the top-scoring entity is returned.4 Extracting events from WikipediaWikipedia is a free, open-domain, web-based encyclopedia [12].
In additionto traditional encyclopedia entries, it also has entries for a variety of timeperiods, which contain lists of historical and/or current events.
We extractevents from the entries for years.
The standardized formatting of year entriesin Wikipedia, together with the wiki markup used for this formatting, makesextracting event descriptions straightforward.
A typical year entry containssections delimited by the second-level headings ==Events==, ==Births==, and==Deaths==.
Each of these sections is optionally split into subsections de-limited by third-level headings indicating months (e.g., ===May===) or thelack of a date (===Unknown date===).
Within these subsections are asterisk-delimited lists, each item of which corresponds to an event (or a date with alist of events).
Event descriptions begin with a date or a date range, if known,and then continue with one or two sentences describing the event.
This textcontains phrases marked up as wiki links (pointers to Wikipedia entries):(3) [[March 10]] - The [[New Hampshire]] primary is won by [[Henry CabotLodge]], Ambassador to [[South Vietnam]].Sometimes, an event description begins with a wiki link, set off with a colon,indicating a larger event (which we call a super-event) of which it is a part:(4) [[August 8]] - [[Watergate scandal]]: US President [[Richard Nixon]]announces his resignation (effective [[August 9]])Given the structured nature of year entries, simple hand-built patternscan be used to perform what amounts to shallow semantic interpretation,extracting event descriptions from the entries, including temporal locationinformation and limited participant and mereological information (via wikilinks and super-events, when present).
For each extracted event description,the date(s) and any embedded wiki links are extracted, using simple pattern-matching, and the text of the description is parsed.
This information is addedto our XML database as an event element with the following sub-elements:date/start date/end date (normalized dates; which one(s) depends on whatis given in the entry), super event (wiki link to super event, if present),description (text of the description), and parse (converted to XML).From the entries for the years from 1600 to 2005, we have extracted about33,000 events, somewhat over half (about 19,000) birth and death events.5 Web mining for fuzzy and qualitative informationThe basic idea behind web mining is that there is enough information on theweb that if there is a significant connection between two events, we should beable to find this connection by searching for patterns that typically express it.We use web mining to build representations of the time span of vague eventsand to find both additional events related to events already in the KB and forqualitative temporal relations between events in the KB.While most of the smaller-scale events extracted from Wikipedia comewith quantitative temporal information, it is not always fully specified.
Fur-thermore, many of the super-events from Wikipedia, as well as the new eventswe mine from the web, lack such information.
We cope with this by search-ing the web for beginning and ending dates using a simple pattern-basedapproach?sending patterns to Google and extracting information from thereturned snippets.
The patterns we use include, e.g., ?event?
began on ?date?and ?event?
lasted until ?date?.
If there is sufficient agreement among differentweb pages about the beginning and ending date of an event, we represent thetime span of this event as an interval.
If not, we use the techniques describedin [9] to construct a suitable fuzzy set [13] to represent the time span, whichis stored in the XML database as part of the event representation.
Of course,for some events, we may fail to find sufficient information about beginning orending dates, in which case they remain undated, or ungrounded, events.We also use a pattern-based approach to mine the web both for new eventsand for temporal relations relating ungrounded events to grounded events.
Be-cause new events are only usable if they can be temporally connected to eventsalready in the KB, we can use a uniform set of hand-crafted patterns that in-dicate a temporal relation between events.
The patterns we use include, e.g.,?NP1?
gave way to ?NP2?
and ?NP2?
took place after ?NP1?, for before/afterrelations, and ?NP1?
and other events during ?NP2?
and ?NP1?
took placeduring ?NP2?, for inclusion relations.
All our patterns relate NP descriptionsof events, which means that they can only be used with known events thathave NP descriptions.
Fortunately, this includes all super-events and newlymined events, which make up most of the ungrounded events in the KB.Since we can use the same patterns to mine for new events and for tempo-ral relations for ungrounded events, we combine the tasks.
Our basic proce-dure for mining with these patterns is as follows.
Substitute either ?NP1?
or?NP2?
with the NP description of a known event, send the resulting pattern toGoogle, and parse and tag the returned snippets with named entities.
ExtractNPs in the other NP position, discarding those tagged as person, location,or organization.
For each remaining NP, if it refers to a known event in theKB, add to the temporal relation network a link between the original knownevent and the event referred to by the mined NP.
Otherwise, add a new eventfor the mined NP and a link between the original event and the new event.The hardest step is determining whether a mined NP refers to an eventalready in the KB.
Coreference resolution is clearly necessary to temporalconstraints on coreferring event descriptions, but to maintain consistency inthe KB, we must be careful in asserting coreference.
We do not try to solvethe cross-document coreference task completely but instead split mined NPsinto two groups.
The first group, which includes all indefinite, demonstrative,quantificational, and pronominal NPs, is added to the temporal network but isnever considered for coreference.
The second group contains NPs that we areconfident refer to a unique event and that are thus candidates for coreference.To find these NPs, we are experimenting with heuristics to determineunique reference.
Some heuristics are capitalization-based, while others arebased on collocation measures using web hit counts [5,8], such as the ratiobetween the number of hits for the entire NP and the product of the hitsfor each of the individual words in the NP (similar to pointwise mutual in-formation [2]).
When an NP is determined to be uniquely referring, we usestring matching to determine whether it is coreferent with an existing eventdescription.
If it is, the temporal relation mined is added to the KB for thisexisting event.
Otherwise, a new event and relation are added to the KB.6 ConclusionWe have described the construction of a knowledge base of events and temporalrelations for a temporal QA system.
We take advantage of a freely available,structured resource?Wikipedia?to obtain relatively accurate quantitative in-formation about events.
We also mine the web to build fuzzy sets for vagueevents and to find events for which we can only get qualitative information.Acknowledgements The first author was supported by the NetherlandsOrganization for Scientific Research (NWO), under project number 612.066.302.The second author was supported by a PhD grant from the Research Foun-dation ?
