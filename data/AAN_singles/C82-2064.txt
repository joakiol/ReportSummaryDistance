In  th i s  d ic t ionary ,  funct ion  of the languagee lements ,  such as words or aux i l i a ry  morpheme, are dbscr~bed.And these lex lca l  ent r ies  are automat ica l ly  const ructed  fromana lys i s  of rea l  text  data~Xn order  to eva luate  the use fu lness  of such d ic t ionary ,we are  accumulat ing Japanese sentences  data ,  and applTJ -~s ta t i s t i ca l  and s t ruc tura l  ana lys i s  method to th i s  data .Xn the fo l low ing  we concent ra te  upon next  2 po in ts .
( 1 ) const ruct ion  of d ic t ionary(2) overview of ESSAY( 1 ) Const ruct ion  of d ic t ionaryAs the in i t ia l  data  we entered  about 2000 sentences  ofe lementary  school  text  in  Kana- le t te r  ( Japanese sy l labary)not  in  KanJi  (Chinese character ) .Japanese i s  an agF~ut inat ive  language,  so  in  ana lyz ingsentences  they are u~ua l ly  separated  in to  number of par ts- 259 -ca l led  Bunsetsu.
In  enter ing  the text  at th i s  t ime,  we a l soused th i s  un i t .
Between these  Bunsetsu,  there  are  some depend-ency re la t ions  ca l led  Kakari -Uke which can be dec ided un ique lyfo r  a~v sentence .
We can cons ider  that  in  case there  i s  a Kaka-r i -Uke  re la t ion  between word A and B, A i s  modi fy ing  B.This t ime we def ined  the  d i s tance  between words main lybased on th i s  Kakari -Uke re la t ion ,  and then o lass i~fted themin to  number of  groups us ing  some c lus ter ing  techn iques .
Am theresu l t  we got  a base-d ic t ionary  which can represent  Kakari-Ukere la t ion  between these  groups.I t  i s  expected that  syntax ,  sau~nt ios  or  knowledge ofthe  world can be natura l ly  embeded in  th i s  d ic t ionary  and th i stype of  lex icon  i s  h igh ly  use fu l  in  the Japanese sentence~ys iso(2) Overview of  ESSAYESSAY (Exper imenta l  System of  Sentence AnalYs is)  parsesJapanese sentence  by ana lyz ing  Kakari -Uke re la t ion  betweenBunmetsu in  input  sentences .This  system ham d ic t ionary  dr iven  feature ,  and does notdepend on usua l  syntact i c  and semant ic  models.
Thus th i ssystem can be used fo r  eva luat ion  of  d ic t ionary ,  which I s  de-scribed in (1).The input  to  th i s  system i s  a Japanese sentence ,  whichi s  segmented in  Bunsetsu un i t ,  and the output  from th i s  systemi s  labe l led  binary t ree  s t ruc ture ,  which represents  syntnot ios t ruc ture  of  the  input  sentence .The a lgor i thm to ext rac t  th i s  s t ruc ture  i s  very  s imple ,and spec ia l  l i ngu is t i c  knowledge i s  not  embedded in  theprooedurab le  way.

This po int  i s  one of the mer i t sof ottr approach, in  comparison wi th  usua l  approaches,  that  tend%0 depend on researcher ' s  framework.In  th i s  paper,  we present  severa l  exper imental  resu l t swhich show the va l id i ty  of our approaoho- 261  -
