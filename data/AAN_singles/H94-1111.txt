VfORDNET:  A LEXICAL  DATABASE FOR ENGL ISHGeorge A. Miller, Principal InvestigatorCognitive Science LaboratoryPrinceton UniversityPrinceton, New Jersey 08542PROJECT GOALSThe goal of this project is to provide lexical resources fornatural language research.
The primary emphases are onthe further development and dissemination of the on-linelexical database, WordNet.
A secondary goal is to learnhow to develop contextual representations for differentsenses of a polysemous word, where a contextual repre-sentation is comprised of topical and local context foreach sense.RECENT RESULTSWordNet  Upgrade:  The basic unit in WordNet is thesynonym set, or synset, which represents a lexicalizedconcept.
Synsets are comprised of open class words(nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) and are con-nected by bi-directional pointers denoting such semanticrelations as synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy, meronymy,troponymy, entailment, etc.
WordNet has been growingat a rate of about 1,500 lexicalized concepts (synsets) permonth.
The major source of new entries has been fromthe COMLZX vocabulary adopted by Ralph Grishman atNYU.
As of February 9, 1994, WordNet contains 81,658synsets and 109,570 unique character strings (words andcollocations).Semant ic  Concordance:  A semantic oncordance isa textual corpus and a lexicon so combined that everysubstantive word in the text is linked to its appropriatesense in the lexicon.
In this case, the textual corpus is theBrown Corpus and the lexicon is WordNet.
103 passagesfrom the Brown Corpus have been tagged with WordNetversion 1.4 senses, and is available to authorized usersof the Brown Corpus.
For information, send emall towordnet@princeton.edu.ESCORT, an X Windows interface to the semantic on-cordance, has been developed.
ESCORT allows a user tosearch the semantic oncordance for sentences containingwords that have been semantically tagged.
In addition,ZSCORT has been incorporated into the WordNet inter-face so that when a user looks up a word, the option ofseeing sentences that use the word in a given sense isavailable.With support from the Linguistic Data Consortium, asemantic concordance is being prepared for the most fre-quent polysemous words from the COMLEX vocabulary.WordNet  Distribution: WordNet version 1.4 was re-leased in August, a new and larger version of the Icxicaldatabase with support for Sun 3, Sun 4, NEXT, SiliconGraphics, DECstation, IBM RS-6000, PC, and Macin-tosh machines, and with upgraded documentation.
TheWordNet database is available via anonymous ftp fromclarity.princeton.edu.As of February, 1994, we have 280 registered users ofWordNet 1.3 or 1.4 in 25 countries.
In April, a WordNetusers group was created and now has 148 members.
Forinformation, send email to wordnet@princeton.edu.Word  Sense Identification: Benchmarks for the per-formance of automatic sense-identification systems havebeen developed, based on statistics derived from the se-mantic concordance for the Brown Corpus.
In addition,a corpus of sentences using the verb "serve" in differentsenses has been compiled and used, along with a similarcorpus of the noun "line" to find topical and local contextfor word sense identification.
In collaboration with staffmembers from Siemens Corporate Research, the use oflocal context was found to improve performance in iden-tifying the intended sense of those polysemous words.
Inaddition, a method was developed using similarity mea-sures based on the structure of WordNet that increasedthe virtual size of training sets.PLANS FOR THE COMING YEARWe will continue to maintain, edit, and upgrade Word-Net and make it available to interested users.
When theCOMLEX vocabulary has been completely incorporatedinto the WordNet database, we plan to release version1.5 and make it available on a CD-ROM.
In addition, thesemantic concordance will continue to grow, and will alsobe made available via ftp.In collaboration with colleagues from Siemens CorporateResearch and Hunter College, research on word senseidentification will continue.468
