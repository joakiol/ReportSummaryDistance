Total or Selected Content ~nalysis IJulius LaffalConnecticut Valley Hospital, F~dd!et~n, Conn.The core of any system of content a~alysis is a dictionary speci-fying the content categories to be assigned to verbal units.
Thesystem described in this paper utilizes a category dictionary in whichall the conmon words of English are classified into one or two of lidpossible catec ories.
2 The associated cemputer method is at presentcapable of analyzing a text of 25,000 words in about 20 minutes ofmachine time, outputting a distribution of frequency of occurrence ofthe 116 content categories.
Up to 15 separate texts may be analyzedat the same time, or the productions of \]5 speakers, mixed in any way,as long as each segment is identified with the appropriate source.The cc~puter analysis program will be discussed briefly, as willsome of the considerations which went into the construction of the dic-tionary.
An il\]nstration of the analysis of textual mater~a\] will bepresented, and two studies applying the procedure will be described.Preparing, a ~ and machine analysisFor any Enc!ish language corpus to be ane~!yzed, a simple editin Cproce@Are is fo\]\]c~zed before the text is card punched.

T~o of the categories (no score and hand-~core) are not actu~!\]ycontent categories.eliminates a number of functions words (articles, most conjunctions,auxiliary verbs such as J~ be and ~ ~ ,  changes all verb forms intothe present infinitive form, and reduces plural noun forms to the singu-lar.
These editing changes are required because the dictionary containsonly the root forms of the word.
Illustrations 3 and 5 show a text andits edited form.
Ultimately, as the dictionary expands to includecommon forms, many of these editing requirements will be reduced.
Thereare 20,000 root forms in the dictionary at present.
The editing pro-cedu~e reduces an original text by between 15% end 20%: a 25,000edited text would originally have consisted of around 40,000 words.The computer analysis is directed solely to content, and does not takegrammatical form into account.
The analysis thus shows what is beingtalked about, but provides no information that the grammar ordinarilyconve~.
It may show that aggression is a major theme of a text, butwill not show who is aggressing against whom.
The researcher may chooseto analyze for total content, as represented by the 116 categories, orspecify a limited number of content categories, in which case the pro-gram will disregard all other categories.The program is at present written in Fortran IV and MAP languages(ultimately to be entirely in Fortran IV).
It consists of a number ofsubroutines capable of performing the following operations on a text:I.
Print the text itself, numbering each line.2.
Output the text words in order of occurrence, showingispeaker and line number.3.
Output the text words in alphabetic order, showing speakerand line number.4.
Output a list of words matched with the stored dictionary,shewing the categories which have been applied to eachmatched word, the speaker number, and the line number.5.
Output a list of words which have more than one possiblescoring in the dictionary (ambiguous words), showingeither a selected number of the possible scoring, or allthe scorings.
Speaker number and line number are alsoindicated.6.
Output a list of words which the dictionary cannot definebecause they are not represented by dictionary entries.7.
Output profiles of the frequency of occurrence of eachof the 116 categories for each speaker.8.
Output a punched deck of category frequency profiles sothat further statistical analyses may be applied.Th__~e Dictionar~To find conceptual uniformities in the vocabulary of a languageposes formidable problems.
In typical content analyses, the researchertakes sentences or larger units, and evaluates them as to the presenceor absence of a particular concept, dismissing as irrelevant to hispurpose any material which does not bear on the concept.
This approachis inadequate if one wishes to deal with all of the content of the sample.There are certain ampirical bases for developing a conceptionalsystem which will deal with all possible contents.
The steps in sucha process may be described briefly.
Numerous words are substantiallysimilar to each other, and essentially synonymous in particular contexts.Dictionaries take advantage of this fact to introduce us to the meaningof unfamiliar words, by providing a synonymous word which we ~ow.Synonyms are of course not alwgys substitutable for each other withoutsome change of meaning, for words may partake of more than one domainof meaning.The number of separate domains of meaning each occupied by a fewsynonyms is extremely large.
As a step toward reduction one may groupwords similar in meaning, even if not synonymous.
Words like walk, run,rid__~e, and ~o readily group together as sharing a c~on meaning.
Appli-cation of the criterion of similarity along with that of synonymy leadsto broader and more inclusive clusters of words.A further reduction in the number of clusters or domains of meaningmay be effected by applying an additional criterion for grouping words:that of relatedness.
If a set of words such as chair, stool, bench,seat, and couch is grouped by synonymy and similarity, considerationsof relatedness may also bring tabl__~e into the same domain of references~ a common item of household furnishing.
The merging of tabl..__~e and chai__~rinto one group also projects the outlines of a category which could in-ciude other ~ like be__dd, dresse______~r, burea______uu, ches____~t, all of which alsorefer to ordinary household furnishings.
These principles of synonymy,similarity, and relatedness, whe~ applied systematically to words, pro-duce a system of categories limited in number but still capable ofdescribing meaningfully all the contents of t~e language.When a certain degree of stability has been reached in construct-ing categories, new words may be considered in terms of how they willfit into the system.
~his does not preclude changing the system; itmerely weighs all the prior Judgments against each new Judgment to bemade, and accepts change Only on compelling grounds.
As the systemgrows, changes are more likely to occur because two existing categoriesare seen to border too closely on each other and to require redefinitionof their boundaries and differences, rather than because new categoriesare discovered.A primary consideration in construction of the present conceptualdictionary was that the scheme of language had to provide an adequatebasis, at the very least, for discriminating the language of one speakerfrom another.
~his meant that each entity in the scheme had to con-tribute to such potential.
In practice this militated against unitswhich were heavily loaded with tokens from everyone's speech and againstunits which rarely contributed a token to anyone's speech.
Such globalcategories as "nature," "man," "animate" and "inanimate" provide verylittle basis for discriminating between the word predilections of sepa-rate speakers, since they inevitably contribute large numbers of tokensto everyone ' s speech.Relatively simple criteria for the acceptability of a category inthe overall scheme were (I) that it not draw ~oo many or too few tokens,and (2) that it contribute to discriminating between separate speakers.~ere,  in the present scheme, a category turned out to be large by thesecriteria, what was also readily apparent was some basis for splittingthe category along one or more lines to produce separate categories.And where a category seemed too narrow, it was possible to merge itwith another neighboring category, the domain of reference than swell-ing to include both meanings.
The area of hostility and aggression wasone which required subdivision along lines which differentiated violence,anger, and simple disagreesnent.
The area of sex, in which at the out-set a discrimination was provided between heterosexual and homosexual,ended by becoming a single area, since very few references occur tohomosexuality as such as opposed to sexuality in general.One other criterion which was applied is related to well ~ownideas of reliability and validity.
The domains of reference in a schemeof language must be sufficiently discriminable from each other so thatseparate judges considering a word will be in agreement as to whichcategories are involved.
If the dcemins of meaning are too closely re-lated, this will be a difficult Judgment and an unreliable one.
To theextent that it is unreliable, its validity and its pertinence to otherbehavior, will be dubious.
Distinctiveness of a domain of reference ina dictionary scheme is therefore an important desideratum.Over the years, as texts from various sources were analyzed, witha continuing effort to fit new words into existing groups or to redefinethe word groups to make them more congruent with word meanings, a dic-tionary of words with their appropriate categories emerged.
The dict-tionary and its mode of application are illustrated on the followingpages which shc~T:!.

A Selection from Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's TravelsMy father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire; I was the thirdof five sons.
He sent me to Emmanuel College in Cambridge at fourteenyears old, where I resided three years, and applied myself close to mystudies; but the charge of maintaining me (although l had a very scantyallowance) being too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound apprenticeto Mr. James Bates, an eminent surgeon in London, with whom I continuedfour years, and my father now and then sending me small smm~ of money,I laid them out in learning navigation and other parts of the mathe-matics useful to those who intend to travel, as I always believed itwould be some time or other my fortune to do.
When I left Mr. Bates,I want down to my father, where, by the assistance of him and my uncleJohn and same other relations, I got forty pounds, and a prmmise ofthirty pounds a year to maintain me at Leyden; there I studied physictwo years and seven months, knowing it would be useful in long voyages.Soon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended by my goodmaster D~.
Bates to be surgeon to the Swallc~, Captain Abraham PannellCommander, with whom I continued three years and a half, making a voy-age or two into the Levant and same other parts.
When I csme back Iresolved to settle in London, to which Mr. Bates, my master, encouragedme, and by him I was reco~aended to several patients.
I took part ofa muall house in the Old Jewry, and, being advised to alter my comdition,I married Mrs. Mary Burton, second daughter to 'Mr.
Edmund Burton, hosierin Newgate Street, with whom I received four hundred paunds for a portion.But my good master Bates dying in two years after, and I havingfew friends, my business began to fail; for my eonsciance would notIIsuffer me to imitate the bad practice of too many among m~ brethren.Having, therefore, consulted with my wife and some of my acquaintances,I determined to go again to sea.
I was surgeon successively in twoships, and made several voyages for six years to the East and WestIndies, by which I got some addition to my fortune.
My hours of lei-"sure I spent in reading the best authors, ancient and mode~n, beingalways provided with a good number of books, and when I was ashore inobserving the manners and dispositions of the people, as well as learn-ing their language, wherein I had a great facility by the strength ofmy mmaory.The last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew wearyof the Sea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family.
Iremoved from the Old Jewry to Fetter Lane, and from thence to Wapping,hoping to get business among the sailors, but it would not turn toaccount.
After three years' expectation that things would mend, Iaccepted an advantageous offer from Captain William Prichard, masterof the Antel~e, who was making a voyage to the South Sea.
We setsail from Bristol, May 4, 1699, and our voyage at first was veryprosperous.124.

Pitcher and Ernst Pre!inger (1963) presentsstories told by boys and girls from ages 2 to 5, taken down in short-hand by one of the authors.
These were a group of economically privi-leged children attending a nursery and kindergarten of a private school.~/ost of the children were of superior or high average intelligence.When the occasion presented itself and the child was for the mamentplaying alone, the researcher asked, "Tell me a story."
~ ly  thosestories were rejected which were a retelling of a familiar fairy taleor television show.The stories taken from the Pitcher-Prelinger book were transcribedonto 13~ cards end analyzed by computer to obtain profiles showing thedistribution of the content of each age group.
In order to sharps~ thesubsequent analysis, all categories showing a frequency of less than1% of the total responses within each profile were elim~ated.
Alsoeliminated was the one category (ANIMAL) which showed a uniform highfrequency (over 7% of the total) for each profile.
These extremelylow and extremely high frequency categories are eliminated becausethey contribute only to raising all correlatiens between profiles anddo not contribute to discriminating between profiles.
~he profiles,now consisting of 52 categories were then correlated with each other,and the matrix of correlations factor analyzed.
I will not presentthe actual factor analysis, but only describe the outcome.24The first factor in the analysis is a "female" factor.
The girlsin all age groups load very highly on it.
When we look in detail atthe categories which contribute most heavily to this factor we findthat YOUNG, F~MALE, and HELP are the three outstanding contributors.In the category system, F~ALE and HELP are the two scorings whichapply to the word mother and its variants.
These findings suggestthat the girls of the study had as central themes in their fantasy,ideas relating to mothers (feminine helpers) and children.The second factor is more clearly relevant to boys, with ages 3and 4 showing predominance.
The most significant categories here areGO, MALE, and TF-~NSPORTATION.
Thus, the boys in the group, particularlythose in the 3 and 4 year bracket, had prominently in their fantasies,references to maleness, physical movement, and vehicles of transporta-tion.The third factor applied primarily to girls age 4 and boys age 5.Primary categories were MALE, GO, and FEATURE (bodily features).
TheF~UP~ and ~LE categories would be consistent with a psychoanalyticview that at this age both boys and girls are in the oedipal periodand are becoming preoccupied with sexuality, and particularly with therelationship to father.The fourth factor seems most clearly applicable to boys age 2,although to a lesser degree it is characteristic of boys age 3, suggest-Iing a decay process with age.
Here the outst~ndin C categories arec~rFLICT I (physical harm), GO, and YOUNG.
Like the other boys, thet~o year olds were also occupied ~th  physical movement.
L i~  the25Fgirls, they were occupied with ideas about children; but violent aggres-sic~ was their most prominent concern and distinguishes them most clear-ly from other groupsA second study by Hartsough and Laffal explores the questionwhether scientists who have been described as visual imagists andscientists who have been described as verbal imagists (Roe, 1952) willalso differ in the types of content ~mployed in their writing.
Thefour sciences which Roe had studied were Social Science, Biology,Experimental Physics, and Theoretical Physics.
Based on a series ofprojective tests and interviews with scientists in these fields, aswell as their self-reports of problem solving activities and typicalmodes of thinking about problems, she concluded that Social Scientistsand Theoretical P~sicists were verbal imagists, while Biologists andExperimental Physicists were visual imagists.
Verbal imagery is think-ing ~In words or talking to oneself, while visual imagery is thinkingin p~ ctures.In our study, we selected three outstandin o - living sc~@nt~stsfrom each of these four disciplines, the Soc~!
Seiences being repre-sented by Anthropologists.
For each Scientist one re~esentative bookwas chosen from his technical publications addressed to colleagues, sndone from his popular writings for the laity.
The key wordsscientist, ~ ,  .Anthropolosy, and ~ were used to identifycontexts for comparison.
A context included the sen~nce containingthe key word, the preceding sentence, and the subsequent sentence.
In26addition to the books of the scientists, an Anthropology, a Biologyand a Physics textbook of this time were also selected.
The contentof the textbooks was sampled by taking three sentences alternatelyfrom the top, middle and bottom of every other page, without regard toany key words.
The writings of the various scientists, and in the texts,were analyzed by the com~rater program described, and content categoryprofiles were obtained.
These profiles were then correlated with eachother and factor analyzed.
I will not present details of the factoranalysis, but only the results.Highly represented on the first factor were all of the Anthropol-ogical writings, and the writings of the Theoretical Physicists.
Sincethese two groups together constitute what Roe had called the verbalscientists, the first factor could be considered a verbal factor.
Theactual content which was stressed in the writings of these scientists,however, evokes more the idea of a "humanistic': factor, since theparticular categories contributing most importantly to the factor areR~SG~ 1 (kn~;ledge and thinking), GROUP, HELP, and GOOD.Thus, the content analysis tells us that what manifests itself asa highly developed verbal co~anicative s~l l ,  also reflects a concernwith h linen affairs and human issues.
Since language is par excellencethe social skill, it is natural that those who use it best would alsobe those whose attention is directed toward the ht~mn condition.The second factor was clearly related to Physics, the writinEs ofthe Theoretical and Applied Physicists loading highest on it.
Thecategories which contributed most to this factor were : REASON 3%227(science), NAT~IAL, REASON 1 (knowledge and thinking) and SOME.
Othercategories which were stressed were ESSENTIAL and TIME 4 (general time).The third factor was clearly a biological factor, since the biologicalwritings loaded highest on it.
The categories of greatest importancewere: FUNCTION (bodily functions), BEGIN CHANGE, MATEP~IAL and FOR-WA~D.To be noted is that no "visual" factor as such appeared in theanalysis.
This suggests that the contrast which had been drawn by Roebetween "verbal" and "visual" may actually be a contrast between thosewith a central humanistic concern inclined to be strongly verbal intheir thinking, and those who do not have this same central interest,who are more likely to stress non-verbal processes in their thinking.The method of total content analysis which I have described isapplicable to many language content problems.
Beside the applicationsdescribed in the present paper, the technique has been used in studiesof the symbolism of key words in the language of a psychotic patient(Laffal, 1960); changes in the language of a patient in treatmen~(Laffal, 1961); comparison of the language of therapists in ta l~ngabout different patieuts (Watson & Laffal, 1963); comparisons of thecontent given by subjects in single word association, continuous wordassociation, and free speech in response to the same stimulus word(Laffal & Feldx~an, 1962, 1963); comparison of the language of two andthree speakers in conversations about a variety of topics (Laffal, 1967).In broadest terms the method may be applied to comparison of oneindividual with himself (for example, over time); one individual with2Banother; a group with itself or with other groups; the contexts sur-rounding one topic with those surrounding some other topic.
The uniquecontribution which it makes is in the use of a category dictionarywhich classifies all the ccmaon words of ~gl i sh  into one or two con-tent categories, so permitting rapid display either of all the contentor of selected contents, in a text.29ReferencesLaffal, J.
