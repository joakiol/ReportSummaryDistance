Stress AJ~p,aMm is Lett~ m Se,,,td Rats fer Speech Sy~Kenneth ChurchAT&T Boll LaboratoriesAbreactThis paper will discuss how to determine word stress from spelling.Stress assignment is a well-established weak point for many speechsynthesizers because stress dependencies cannot be determined locally.It is impossible to determine the stress of a word by looking through afive or six character window, as many speech synthesizers do.
Well-known examples such as degrade / dbgradl, tion and tMegraph /telegraph5 demonstrate hat stress dependencies can span over two andthree syllables.
This paper will pre~nt a principled framework fordealing with these long distance dependencies.
Stress assignment willbe formulated in terms of Waltz' style constraint propagation with foursources of constraints: (1) syllable weight.
(2) part of speech.
(3)morphology and (4) etymology.
Syllable weight is perhaps the mostinteresting, and will be the main focus of this paper.
Most of whatfollows has been implemented.I.
Back~e,,sdA speech synthesizer is a machine that inputs a text stream andoutputs an accoustic signal.
One small piece of this problem will bediscussed here: words - -  phonemes.
The resulting phonemes are thenmapped into a sequence of Ipe dyads which are combined withduration and pitch information to produce speech.text - -  intonation phrases - -  wordsphonemes - -  Ipc dyads + prosody - -  accousti?
-~There are two general approaches to word - -  phonemes:?
Dictionary Lookup?
Letter to Sound (i.e.. sound the word out from basic principles)Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages; thedictionary approach fails for unknown words (e.g.. proper nouns) andthe letter to sound approach fails when the word doesn't follow therules, which happens all too often in English.
Most speech synthesizersadopt a hybrid strategy, using the dictionary when appropriate andletter to sound for the rest.Some people have suggested to me that modern speech synthesizersshould do away with letter to sound rules now that memory prices aredropping so low that it ought to be practical these days to put everyword of English into a tiny box.
Actually memory prices are still amajor factor in the cost of a machine.
But more seriously, it is notpossible to completely do away with letter to sound rules because it isnot possible to enumerate all of the words of English.
A typicalcollege dictionary of 50,000 hcadwords will account for about 93% of atypical newspaper text.
The bulk of the unknown words are properflOUfl-q.The difficulty with pmpor nouns h demonstrated by the table belowwhich compares the Brown Corpus with the surnames in the KansasCity Telephone Book.
The table answers the question: how much ofeach corpus would be covered by a dictionary of n words?
Thus thefirst line shows that a dictionary of 2000 words would cover 68% of theBrown Corpus, and a dictionary of 2000 names would cover only 46%of the Kansas City Telephone Book.
It should be clear from the tablethat a dictionary of surnames must be much targar than a typicalcollege dictionary ('20,000 entries).
Moreover.
it would be a lot ofwork to consu'u~ such a dictionary since there are no existingcomputer readable dictionaries for surnames.Size of Brown Size ofWord Dictionary Corpus Name Diczionary2000 68% 20004000 78% 40006000 83% 60008000 86% 8000lO000 89% 1000012000 91% 1200014000 92% 1400016000 94% 16ooo!

A fair test would not use the same corpusfor both selecting the words to go into the dictionary and for testingthe coverage.
The scores reported here were computed post hoc, aclassic statistical error, l tried a more fair test, where a dictionary of43777 words (the entire Brown Corpus) was tested against a corpus of10687 words selected from the AP news wire.
The results howed 96%coverage, which is slightly lower (as expected) than the 99% figurereported in the table for a 40000 dictionary.For names, the facts are much more striking as demonstrated in thefollowing table which teats name lists of various sizes against he BellLaboratories phone book.
(As above, the name lists were gatheredfrom the Kansas City Telephone Book.

To increase the coverage beyondthis, it is probably neceqsary to apply alternative methods uch as letterto sound rules.Over the past year l have been developing a set of letter to sound rulesas part of a larger speech synthesis project currently underway atMurray Hill.
Only one small piece of my letter to sound rules,orthography ~ stress, will be discussed here.
The output streuassignment is then used to condition a number of rules such aspalatalization i the mapping from letters to phonemes.2.
we/ght as ~ i,termt~tm ~ of Relm~mmutmIntuitively, stre~s dependencies come in two flavors: (a) those thatapply locally within a syllable, and (b) throe that apply globallybetween syllables.
Syllable weight is an attempt o represent the localstress constraints.
Syllables are marked either heavy or light,depending only on the local 'shape' (e.g., vowel length and number ofIx~t-vocalic consonants).
Heavy syllables are more likely to be?
Admittedly.
this teat is somewhat unfair to the dictionary appma?h sinca: thu ethnicmzxture in gamuut City is very differeat from that found here at Bell t .abof l l to t~stressed than light syllables, though the actual outcome depends uponcontextual constraints, uch as the English main stress rule, which willbe d ~  shortly.The notion of weight is derived from Chomsky and Halle's notion ofstrong and weak clusters \[Chonuky and Halle\] (SPE).
Inphonological theory, weight is used as an intermediate level ofrepresentation between the input underlying phonologicalrepresentation a d the output stress aaignment.
In a similar fashion, \[will use weight as an intermediate l vel of representation between theinput orthography and the output strew.
The orthography - -  stressproblem will be split into two subproblems:?
Orthography - -  Weight?
Weight ~ Stress3.
What is Sy~ Weight:Weight is a binary feature (Heavy or Light) assigned to each syllable.The final syllables of the verbs obey, maintain, erase, torment.collapse, and exhaust arc heavy because they end in a long vowel ortwo consonants, in constrast, the final syllables of develop, astonish.edit.
consider, and promise are light because they end in a short voweland at moat one consonant.
More precisely, to compute the weight ofa syllable from the underlying phonological representation, strip off.

if the syllable is c lo~ (i.e., ends in a consonant as in tor.men)or if the vowel is marked underiyingly long (as in ow.bey), the syllableis marked heavy.
Otherwise, the syllable ends in an open short voweland it is marked light.
Determining syllable weight from theorthography is considerably more difficult than from the underlyingphonological form.
I will return to this question shortly.4.
we/s l t  - -  StnmGlobal stress assignment rules apply off" the weight representation.
Forexample, the main stress rule of English says that verbs have finalstress if the final syllable is heavy syllable (e.g., obey), and penultimatestress if the final syllable light syllable (e.g., develop).
The main stressrule works similarly for nouns, except that the final syllable is ignored(extrametrical \[Hayes\]).
Thus, nouns have penultimate stress if thepenultimate syllable is heavy (e.g, aroma) and antipenultimate stressif the penultimate syllable is light (e.g., cinema).

SWeat's WeiOt TableA large number of phonological studies (e.g., \[Chomsky and HalleL\[Liberman and PrineeL \[Hayes\]) outline a deterministic procedure forassigning stress from the weight representation and the number ofextrametrical syllables (1 for nouns, 0 for verbs).
A version of thisprocedure was implemented by Richard Sproat last summer.For efficiency purposes.
Sproat's program was compiled into a table,,which associated each possible input with the appropriate stresspattern.Sweat's Weight TablePart of SpeechWeightVerb NounH .I IL l IHH 31 I0HL  I0 I0LH 01 I0 1LL  I0 I I0 1HHH 103 \] 3101HHL 310 I 310HLH 103 1(30HLL 310 10OLHH 103 010LHL 010 010LLH I03 10OLLL 010 100etc.Note that the table is extremely small.
Assuming that words have upNto N syllables and up to E extrametrical syllables, there are E~2 ~possible inputs.
For E - 2 and N - 8, the table has only 1020 entries,which is not unreasonable.6.
Amlolff with Walt-' Comtndat Prolmptiea ParadigmRecall that Waltz was the first to showed how contraints could be usedeffectively in his program that analyzed line drawings in order toseparate the figure from the ground and to distinguish concave edgesfrom convex ones.
He first assigned each line a convex label (+), aconcave label ( - )  or a boundary label (<,  >) ,  using only ~ocalinformation.
If the local information was ambiguous, he would assigna line two or more labels.
Waltz then took advantage of theconstraints impmed where multiple lines come together at a commonvertex.
One would think th~ t there ought to be 42 ways to label avertex of two lines and 4 '~ ways to label a vertex of three lines and soon.
By this argument, there ought to be 208 ways to label a vertex.But Waltz noted that there were only 18 vetex labelings that wereconsistent with certain reasonable assumptions about the physicalworld.
Because the inventory of possible labelings was so small, hecould disambiguate lines with multiple assignments by checking thejunctures at each end of the line to see which of the assignments wereconsistent with one of the 18 possible junctures.
This simple testturned out to be extremely powerful.Sproat's weight table is very analogous with Waltz' list of vertexconstraints; both define an inventory of global contextual constraints ona set of local labels (H and L syllables in this application, and +.
- ,> ,  < in Waltz application).
Waltz' constraint propagation paradigmdepends on a highly constrained inventory of junctures.
Recall thatonly 18 of 208 possible junctures turned out to be grammatical.Similarly, in this application there are very strong grammaticalconstraints.
According to Spmat's table, there are only 51 distinctoutput stress a.udgnmeats, a very small number considering that thereare 1020 distinct inputs.Pe~ible Stress AssignmentsI 103 3103 020100 02020133 310 02010 020103 20020100l 313 02013 200100 200201331 010O 20010 200103 2020100I0 0103 20013 202010 202010313 2001 20100 202013 3202010010 2010 20103 320100 3202013013 2013 32010 320103 02020100100 3100 32013 0202010 02020103200201002002010320202010202020133202010032020103The strength of these constraints will help make up for the fact thatthe mapping from orthography to weight is usually underdetermined,In terms of information theory, about half of the bits in the weightrepresentation arc redundant since log 51 is about half of log 1020.This means that I only have to determine the weight for about half ofthe syllables in a word in order to assign stress.The redundancy of the weight representation can also been seendirectly from Sproat's weight table as shown below For a one syllablenoun, the weight is irrelevant.
For a two syllable noun, the weight ofthe penultimate is irrelevant.
For a three syllable noun, the weight of248the antipenultimate syllable is irrelevant if the penultimate is light.For a four syllable noun, the weight of the antipenultimate is irrelevantif the penultimate is light and the weight of the initial two syllables areirrelevant if the penultimate is heavy.
These redundancies follow, ofcourse, from general phonological prin~ples of stresa ssignment.Weigi~ by Stress (fee short Noum)Stress Weight!

O r e ~  - w ~For practical purposes, Sproat's table offers a complete solution to theweight -- stress subtask.
All that remains to be solved is: orthographyweight.
Unfortunately, this problem is much more dif~cult andmuch less well understood.
1'11 start by discussing some easy _~_,-e~,and then introduce the pseudo-weight euristic which helps in some o\[the more di~icuit cas~.
Fortunately, l don't need a complete solutionto orthography ~ weight since weight ~ stress is so well constrained.In easy cases, it is pmsible m determine the weight directly for theorthography.
For example, the weight of torment must be "HH"because both syllables arc cloud (even after stripping off the finalconsonant).
Thus, the stress of torment is either "31" or "13" stressdepending on whether is has 0 or I extrametricai final syllables:"(strop-from-weights "HH" 0) - -  ('31") ; verb(stress-from-weights "HH" l) - -  ('13") ; nounHowever, meet cases are not this easy.
Consider a word like recordwhere the first syllable might be light if the first vowel is reduced or itmight be heavy if the vowel is underlyingly long or if the first syllableincludes the /k/.
It seems like it is imix~sstble to say anything in acase like this.
The weight, it appears is either "LH" or "HH'.
Evenwith this ambiguity, there are only three distinct stress assignments:01, 31, and 13.AaueUy, ~ practk~.

it is possible now to use the stress to further constrain theweight.
Note that if the first syllable of record is light it must also beunstressed and if it is heavy it also must be stressed.
Thus, the thirdline above is inconsistent.I implement this additional constraint by assigning record a pseudo-weight of "'-H', where the "-."
sign indicates that the weight a~sigmentis constrained to be the same as the stress assigment (either heavy &stressed or not heavy & not stressed), \[ can now determine thepossible stress assignments of the p~eudo-weight ".-H" by filling in the""" constraint with all possible bindings (H or L) and testing theresults to make sure the constraint is met.

Silent e, Vocalic y and Syllabic Sonorants (e.g., .le.

Digraphs that are usually realized as long vowels (e.g.. oi)are marked H.c. Syllables ending with sonorant consonants are marked N;other closed syllables are marked H.d.
Open syllables are marked - .In practice.
I have observed that there are remarkably few stressassignments meeting all of the constraints.
After analyzing over20.000 words, there were no more than 4 possible stress assigments forany particular combinatton of pseudo-weight and number ofextrametrical number of syllables.
Most observed combinations had aunique stre~ assignment, and the average (by observed combinationwith no frequency normalization) has 1.5 solutions.
In short, theconstraints are extremely powerful; words like record with multiplestress patterns are the exception rather than the rule.9.
Order~ Muitipte SelmimeGenerally, when there are multiple stress assignments, one of thepossible stress assigments i  much more plausible than the others.
Forinstance, nouns with the pseudo-weight of "H--L* (e.g., difference)have a strong tendency toward antipenultimate stress, even though theycould have either 100 or 310 stress depending on the weight of thepenultimate.
The program takes advantage of this fact by returning asorted list of solutions, all of which meet the constraints, but thesolutions toward the front of the list are deemed more plausible thanthe solutions toward the rear of the list.
(stress-from-weights "l-I--L" I) - -  ('100" "3 I0")Sorting the solution space in this way could be thought of as a kind ofdefault reasoning mechanism.
That is, the ordering criterion, in effect,assigns the penultimate syllable a default weight of L. unless there ispositive evidence to the contrary.
Of course, this sorting technique isnot as general as an arbitrary default reasoner, but it seems to begeneral enough for the application.
This limited defaulting mechanismis extremely efficient when there are only a few solutions meeting theconstraints.This default mechanism is also used to stress the following nounsHottentot Jackendoff balderdashampersand Hackensack ArkansasAlgernon mackintosh davenportmerchandise cavalcade palindromenightingale Appelbaum Aberdeenmisanthropewhere the penultimate syllable ends with a sonorant consonant (n. r, t).According to what has been said so far, these sonorant syllables areclosed and so the penultimate syllable should be heavy and shouldtherefore be stressed.
Of course, these nouns all have antipenultimatestress, so the rules need to be modified.
Hayes suggested a SonorantDnstressing rule which produced the desired results by erasing the footstructure (destressing) over the penultimate syllable so that later ruleswill reanalyze the syllable as unstressed.
I propose instead to assignthese sonorant syllables the pseudo-weight of N which is essentiallyidentical to - .
*  In this way.
all of these words will have the pseudo-weight of  HNH which is most l ikely stressed as 103 (the correctanswer) even though 313 also meets the constraints, but fair worse onthe order ing criteron.
(stress-from-weights "HNH" I) - -  ('I03" "313")Contrast the examples above with Adirondack where the stress doesnot back ap past the sonorant syllable.
The ordering criterion isadjusted to produce the desired results in this case, by assuming thattwo binary feet (i.e., 2010 stress) are more plausible than one tertiaryfoot (i.e., 0100 stress).
(weights-from-orthography "Adirondack') - -  "L -NH"(stress-from-weights "L -NH' )  - -  ('2013" "0103")It ought to be possible to adjust the ordering criterion in this way toproduce (essentially) the same results as Hayes" rules.tO.
M ~Thus far, the di~-usion has assumed monomorphemic input.Morphological affixes add yet another rich set of constraints.
Recallthe examples mentioned in the abstract, degrhde/dlrgrudhtion andtklegruphkei~grophy, which were used to illustrate that stressalternations are conditioned by morphology.
This section will discusshow this is handled in the program.
The task is divided into twoquestions: (I) how to parse the word into morphemes, and (2) how tointegrate the morphological parse into the rest of stress assignmentprocedure discussed above.~" N s-d - used to I~ idlm"aL I sm -,ill am mm du~ differeeczs us just~'=d.

IU di f fert~s m~l vm7 ml~ t- aad ?~rtamly om ~q)rth pin S into h~e.250The morphological parser uses a grammar roughly of the form:word - -  level3 (regular-inflection)*level3 - -  (level3-prefix) * level2 (level3-suffix)*level2 - -  (levei2-prefix)* levell (level2-suffix)*levell ~ (levell-profix)* (syl)* (leveli-suffix)*where latinate affixes such as in+.
it+, ac+, +ity, +ion.
+ire.
-alare found at level l, Greek and Germanic al~tes such as hereto#,un#.
under#.
#hess.
#/y are found at level 2, and compounding isfound at level 3.
The term level refers to Mohanan's theory of LevelOrdered Morphology and Phonology \[Mohanan\] which builds upon anumber of well-known differences between + boundary affixes (level I)and # boundary affixes (level 2).?
Distributional Evidence: It is common to find a level \[ affix insidethe scope of a level 2 affix (e.g., nn#in +terned and form +al#ly),but not the other way around (e.g., *in+un#terned and?
form#1y +al).?
Wordness: Level 2 affixes attach to words, whereas level I affixesmay attach to fragments.
Thus, for example, in+ and +ai canattach to fragments as in intern and criminal in ways that level 2cannot *un#tern and *crimin#ness.?
Stress Alternations: Stress alternations are found at level I p~rentparent +hi but not at level 2 as demonstrated by parent#hood.Level 2 suffixes are called stress neutral because they do not movestress.?
Level I Phonological Rules: Quite a number of phonological rulesapply at level I but not at level 2.
For instance, the so-called triosyllabic will lax a vowel before a level I suffix (e.g.. divine --divin+ity) but not before a level 2 suffix (e.g., dcvine#ly anddevine#hess).
Similarly, the role that maps /t/ into /sd inpresident ~ pre~dency also fails to apply before a level 2 affix:president#hood (not *presidence#hood).Given evidence such as this, there can be little doubt on the necessityof the level ordering distinction.
Level 2 affixes are fairly easy toimplement; the parser simply strips off the stress neutral affixes,assigns tress to the parts and then pastes the results back together.For instance, paremhood is parsed into parent and #hood.
The piecesare assigned 10 and 3 stress respectively, producing 103 stress whenthe pieces are recombined.
In general, the parsing of level 2 affixes isnot very.
difficult, though there are some cases where it is very difficultto distinguish between a level I and !evel 2 affix.
For example, -able islevel 2 in changeable (because of silent ?
which is not found beforelevel I suffixes), but level I in cbmparable (bocause of the strees hiftfrom compare which is not found before level 2 suffixes).
For dealingwith a limited number of affixes like .able and -merit, there are anumber of special purpose diagnnstic procedures which decide theappropriate l vel.Level I suffixes have to be strer,,sed ifferently.
In the lexicon, eachlevel I suffix is marked with a weight.
Thus, for example, the su~+~'ty is marked RR.
These weights are assigned to the last twosyllables, regularless of what would normally be computed.
Thus, theword civii+ity is assigned the pseudo-weight - - -RR  which is thenassigned the correct stress by the usual methods:(stress-from-weights " ' - -RR"  1) - -  ('0100" "3100")The fact that +ity is marked for weight in this way makes it relativelyeasy for the program to determine the location of the primary stress.Shown below are some sample results of the program's ability to assignprimary stress.

Examples such assuper +fluou~ (levell 1), s;,per#conducwr (level 2), andsr, per##market (level 3) illustrate just how difficult it is to assign theprefix to the correct level.
Even with the correct parse, it not a simplematter to assign stress.
In general, level 2 pretixes are stressed likecompounds, assigning primary stress to the left morpheme (e.g.,?,ndercarriage) for nouns and to the right for verbs (e.g., undergb) andadjectives (e.g., ;,ltracons~rvative), though there seem to be two classesof excentions.

primary stress can back up onto the prefix: (e.g.,telegraphy).
Secondly, certain level 1 suffixes such as +ity seem toinduce a remarkable stress shift (e.g., sfiper#conductor andsi~per#conductDity), in violation of level ordering as far as I can see.For level 1 suffutes, the program assumes the prefixes are marked lightand that they are extrametricai in verbs, but not in nouns.
Prefixextrametrieality accounts for the well-known alternation p~rmit (noun)versus permlt (verb).

Forinstance, consider the Italian word tort6nL By the reasoning outlinedabove, tortbni ought to stress like c;,lcuii since both words have thesame part of speech and the same syllable weights, but obviously, itdoesn't.
In tact.
almost all Italian loan words have penultimate stress,as illustrated by the Italian surnames: Aldrigh~ttL Angel~tti.
Beli&ti./ann~cci.
Ita\[ihno.
Lombardlno.
Marci~no.
Marcbni.
Morillo.
Oliv~ttLIt is clear from examples uch as these that the stress of Italian loansis not dependent upon the weight of the penultimate syllable, unlikethe stress of native English words.
Japanese loan words are perhapseven more striking in this respect.
They too have a very strongtendency toward penultimate stress when (mis)pronounced by Englishspeakers: Asah&a.
Enomo.
Fujimhki.
Fujim&o.
Fujim;,ru.Funasl, ka, Toybta.
Um~da.
One might expect hat a loan word wouldbe stressed using either the rules of the the language that it wasborrowed from or the rules of the language that it was borrowed into.But neither the rules of Japanese nor the rules of English can accountfor the penultimate stress in Japanese loans.I believe that speakers of English adopt what i like m call a pseudo-foreign accent.
That is.
when speakers want to communciate that aword is non-native, they modify certain parameters of the Englishstress rules in simple ways that produce bizarre "foreign sounding"outputs.
Thus, if an English speaker wants to indicate that a word isJapanese, he might adopt a pseudo-Japanese accent that marks allsyllables heavy regnardless of their shape.
Thus, Fujimfira, on thisaccount, would be assigned penultimate stress because it is noun andthe penultimate syllable is heavy.
Of course there are numerousalternative pseudo-Japanese accents that also produce the observedpenultimate stress.
The current version of the program assumes thatJapanese loans have light syllables and no extrametricality.
At thepresent time, I have no arguments for deciding between these twoalternative pseudo-Japanese accents.The pseudo-accent approach presupposes that there is a method fordistinguishing native from non-native words, and for identifying theetymological distinctions required for selecting the appropriatepseudo-accent.
Ideally, this decision would make use of a number ofphonotactic and morphological cues, such as the fact that Japanese hasextremely restricted inventory of syllables and that Germanic makesheavy use of morphemes such as .berg, wein.
and .stein.Unfortunately, because I haven't had the time to develop the rightmodel, the relavant etymological distinctions are currently decided by astatistical tri-gram model.
Using a number of training sets (gatheredfrom the telephone book, computer readable dictionaries,bibliographies, and so forth), one for each etymological distinction.
Iestimated a probability P(xyz~e) that each three letter sequence xyz isassociated with etymology e. Then.
when the program sees a newword w, a straightforward Baysian argument is applied in order toestimate for each etymology a probability P(eb*) based on the threeletter sequences in w.I have only just begun to collect training sets, but already the resultsappear promising.
Probability estimates are shown in the figure belowfor some common names whose etymology most readers probablyknow.

Only thetop two candidates are shown and only if the probability estimate is0.05 or better.As is to be expected, the model is relatively good at fitting the trainingdata.

As theseexceptions demonstrate, the model has relatively more difficulty withshort names, for the obvious reason that short names have fewer tri-grams to base the decision on.
Perhaps hort names should be dealtwith in some other way (e.g.. an exception dictionary).I expect he model to improve as the training sets are enlarged.
It isnot out of the question that it might be possible to train the model on avery large number of names, so that there is a relatively smallprobability that the program will be asked to estimate the etymology ofa name that was not in one of the training sets.
If.
for example, thetraining sets included the I00OO must frequent names, then mint of thenames the program would be asked about would probably be in one thetraining sets (assuming that the results reported above for thetelephone directories also apply here).Before concluding.
I would like to point out that etymology is not justused for stress assignment.
Note.
for instance, that orthographic chand gh are hard in Italian loans Macchi and spaghetti, in constrast tothe general pattern where ch is /ch/ and /ghJ is silent.
In general.velar softening seems to be cooditionalized by etymology.
Thus, forer, ample" /g/ is usually soft before / I /  (as in ginger) but not in girland Gibson and many other Germanic words.
Similarly.
otherphonological rules (especially vowel shift) seem to be conditionalizedby etymology.
\[ hope to include these topics in a longer version of thispaper to be written this summer.12.
Cmc~l~t  RemarksStress assignment was formulated in terms of Waltz' constraintpropagation paradigm, where syllable weight played the role of Waltz'?
labels and Sproat's weight table played the role of Waltz' vertexconstraints.
It was argued that this formalism provided a cleancomputational framework for dealing with the following four linguisticissues:?
