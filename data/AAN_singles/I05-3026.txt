Weparticipated in all tracks at the bakeoff.The evaluation results show our systemcan achieve an F measure of 0.940-0.967 for different testing corpora.1 IntroductionWord segmentation is very important for Chi-nese text processing, which is aiming at recog-nizing the implicit word boundaries in plainChinese text.
Over the past decades, great pro-gress has been made with Chinese wordsegmentation technology.
However, twodifficulties still face us while developing apractical segmentation system for large openapplications, i.e.
the resolution of ambiguoussegmentation and the identification of unknownor out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.In order to resolve the above two problems,we developed a purely statistical Chinese wordsegmentation system using a two-stage strategy.We participated in eight tracks at the SecondInternational Chinese Word SegmentationBakeoff sponsored by the ACL-SIGHAN, andtested our system on different testing corpora.The scored results show that our system is effec-tive for most of ambiguous segmentation andunknown words in Chinese text.
In this paper,we make a summary of this work and give someanalysis on the results.The rest of this paper is organized as follows:First in Section 2, we describe in brief a two-stage strategy for Chinese word segmentation.Then in Section 3, we give details about the set-tings or configuration of our system for differenttesting tracks, particularly the training data andthe dictionaries used in our system.
Finally, wereport the results of our system at this bakeoff inSection 4, and give our conclusions on this workin Section 5.2 Overview of the SystemIn practice, our system works in two major stepsas follows:The first step is a process of known wordsegmentation, which aims to segment an inputsequence of Chinese characters into a sequenceof known words that are listed in the system dic-tionary.
In our current system, we apply aknown word bigram model to perform this task(Fu and Luke, 2003; Fu and Luke, 2004; Fu andLuke, 2005).Actually, known word segmentation is aprocess of disambiguation.
Given a Chinesecharacter stringncccC L21= , there are usuallymultiple possible segmentations of known wordsmwwwW L21=  according to the system diction-ary.

(1)The second step is actually a tagging task onthe sequence of known words acquired in thefirst step, which intends to detect unknown165words or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in theinput.
In this process, each known word yieldedin the first step will be further assigned a propertag that indicates whether the known word is anindependent segmented word by itself or a be-ginning/middle/ending component of an OOVword  (Fu and Luke, 2004).
In order to improveour system, part-of-speech information is alsointroduced in some tracks such as the PKU opentest and the AS open test.
Furthermore, alexicalized HMM tagger is developed to per-form this task (Fu and Luke, 2004).Given a sequence of known wordsnwwwW L21= , the lexicalized HMM taggerattempt to find an appropriate sequence of tagsntttT L21?

(2)3 Settings for Different TracksTable 1.
Training corpora for different tracksTable 1 presents the corpora used to train oursystem for different tracks.
In the AcademiaSinica (AS) open test and the Peking University(PKU) open test, our system is trained respec-tively using the Sinica Corpus (3.0) and the PFRCorpus.
In all other tests, including all closedtests, City University of Hong Kong (CityU)open test and Microsoft Research (MSR) opentest, we trained our system using the relevanttraining corpora provided for the bakeoff.Track Training Corpus WordcountsAS-O The Sinica Corpus 3.0  5,692,150AS-C AS corpus for Bakeoff 2005 5,449,698CityU-O CityU corpus for Bakeoff 2005 1,455,629CityU-C CityU corpus for Bakeoff 2005 1,455,629MSR-O MSR corpus for Bakeoff 2005 2,368,391MSR-C MSR corpus for Bakeoff 2005 2,368,391PKU-O The PFR Corpus  7,286,960PKU-C PKU corpus for Bakeoff 2005 1,109,947Table 2 shows all the dictionaries used in oursystem for different tracks.In the closed test, the system dictionaries arederived automatically from the relevant trainingcorpora for this bakeoff by using the followingthree criteria: (1) Each character in the trainingcorpus is taken as an independent entry and col-lected into the relevant system dictionary.
(2) Astandard Chinese word in the training corpuswill enter to the relevant dictionary if it has fouror less Chinese characters within it, and at thesame time, its counts of occurrence in the corpusis observed to be larger than a threshold.
In ourcurrent system, the threshold is set to 10 for theAS closed test and 5 for other closed tests.
(3)For non-standard Chinese words such as nu-meral expressions, English words and punctua-tions, if they consist of multiple characters, theywill be not included in the system dictionary.As for the open test, some other dictionariesare applied.
As can be seen from Table 2, theCKIP Lexicon and Chinese Grammar is used inboth AS and CityU open test, and the Gram-matical Knowledge-base of Contemporary Chi-nese developed by the Peking University isutilized in both PKU and MSR open test.Track System dictionary # ofentriesAS-O The CKIP Lexicon and Chinese Grammar 84KAS-C Automatically extracted from AScorpus for Bakeoff 2005 30KCityU-OThe CKIP Lexicon and ChineseGrammar (without part-of-speech)84KCityU-C Automatically extracted from CityU corpus for Bakeoff 2005 22KMSR-OThe Grammatical Knowledge-base of Contemporary Chinese(without part-of-speech)65KMSR-C Automatically extracted from MSR corpus for Bakeoff 2005 17KPKU-O The Grammatical Knowledge-base of Contemporary Chinese 65KPKU-C Automatically extracted from PKU corpus for Bakeoff 2005 17KTable 2.
System dictionaries for different tracksIt should be noted that part-of-speech infor-mation is also utilized in the AS open test andthe PKU open test, because part-of-speech in-formation proved to be informative in identify-ing OOV words in Chinese text (Fu and Luke,2004).
Therefore, the training corpora for thetwo tests are tagged with part-of-speech, andentries in the relevant dictionaries are definedwith their potential part-of-speech categories.1664 The Scored ResultsIn Bakeoff 2005, six measures are employed toscore the performance of a word segmentationsystem, namely recall (R), precision (P), theevenly-weighted F-measure (F), out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate for the test corpus, recallwith respect to OOV words (ROOV) or in-vocabulary words (Riv).In order to achieve a consistent evaluation ofour system in both the closed test and the opentest, OOV is defined in this paper as the set ofwords in the test corpus but not occurring inboth the training corpus and the system diction-ary.
Furthermore, the additional two rates, i.e.OOV-C and OOV-D are used to denote the out-of-vocabulary rate with respect to the trainingcorpus and the out-of-vocabulary rate withrespect to the system dictionary, respectively.
Atthe same time, the precision with regard to in-vocabulary words (Piv) and OOV words (POOV)are also computed in this paper to give a morecomplete evalution of our system in unknownword identification.Track OOV-C OOV-D OOVAS-O 0.043 0.096 0.039AS-C 0.043 0.096 0.043CityU-O 0.074 0.140 0.049CityU-C 0.074 0.127 0.074MSR-O 0.026 0.076 0.023MSR-C 0.026 0.087 0.026PKU-O 0.038 0.070 0.033PKU-C 0.058 0.091 0.058Table 3.

Scores for different tracksThe OOV rates and scores of our system aresummarized respectively in Table 3 and Table 4.The results show that our system can achieve aF-measure of 0.940-0.967 for different testingcorpora while the relevant OOV rates are from0.023 to 0.074.Although our system has achieved a promis-ing performance, there is still much to be doneto improve it.
Firstly, our system is purely statis-tics-based, it cannot yield correct segmentationsfor all non-standard words (NSWs) such as nu-meral expressions and English strings in Chi-nese text.
Secondly, known word segmentationand unknown word identification are taken astwo independent stages in our system.
Thisstrategy is obviously simple and more easilyapplicable (Fu and Luke, 2003).
Although theknown word bigram model can partly resolvethis problem, it is not always effective for somecomplicated strings that contains a mixture ofambiguities and unknown words, such as ?31?
and the fragment ??
in the sen-tence ??.5 ConclusionsThis paper presents a two-stage statistical wordsegmentation system for Chinese.
We partici-pated in all testing tracks at the second Sighanbakeoff.
The scored results show that our systemcan achieve a F-measure of 0.940-0.967 as awhole for different corpora.
This indicates thatthe proposed system is effective for most am-biguous segmentations and unknown words inChinese test.
For future work, we hope to im-prove our system by incorporating some patternrules to handle complicated ambiguous frag-ments and non-standard words in Chinese text.ReferencesGuohong Fu, and Kang-Kwong Luke.
