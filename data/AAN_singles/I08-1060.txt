We train a classifier for identi-fying those synonymous relations by usingspelling variations as main clues.
We com-pared two approaches: the direct identifi-cation of bilingual synonym pairs, and themerger of two monolingual synonyms.
Weshowed that our approach achieves a highpair-wise precision and recall, and outper-forms the baseline method.1 IntroductionAutomatically collecting synonyms from languageresources is an ongoing task for natural languageprocessing (NLP).
Most NLP systems have diffi-culties in dealing with synonyms, which are differ-ent representations that have the same meaning ina language.
Information retrieval (IR) could lever-age synonyms to improve the coverage of search re-sults (Qiu and Frei, 1993).
For example, when weinput the query ?transportation in India?
into an IRsystem, the system can expand the query to its syn-onyms; e.g.
?transport?
and ?railway?, to find moredocuments.This paper proposes a method for the automaticidentification of bilingual synonyms in a bilinguallexicon, with spelling variation clues.
A bilingualsynonym set is a set of translation-equivalent termpairs sharing the same meaning.
Although a numberof studies have aimed at identifying synonyms, thisis the first study that simultaneously finds synonymsin two languages, to our best knowledge.Let us consider the case where a user enters theJapanese query ?ko?jo??
(?
?, industrial plant) into across-lingual IR system to find English documents.After translating the query into the English trans-lation equivalent, ?plant,?
the cross-lingual IR sys-tem may expand the query to its English synonyms,e.g.
?factory,?
and ?workshop,?
and retrieve docu-ments that include the expanded terms.
However,the term ?plant?
is ambiguous; the system may alsoexpand the query to ?vegetable,?
and the system isprevented by the term which is different from ourintention.
In contrast, the system can easily rejectthe latter expansion, ?vegetable,?
if we are aware ofbilingual synonyms, which indicate synonymous re-lations over bilingual lexicons: (ko?jo?, plant)?
(ko?jo?,factory) and (shokubutsu1, plant) ?
(shokubutsu,vegetable)2 (See Figure 1).
The expression of thetranslation equivalent, (ko?jo?, plant), helps a cross-lingual IR system to retrieve documents that includethe term ?plant,?
used in the meaning for ko?jo?, or in-dustrial plants.We present a supervised machine learning ap-proach for identifying bilingual synonyms.
Design-ing features for bilingual synonyms such as spellingvariations and bilingual associations, we train a clas-sifier with a manually annotated bilingual lexiconwith synonymous information.
In order to evaluatethe performance of our method, we carried out ex-periments to identify bilingual synonyms by two ap-proaches: the direct identification of bilingual syn-onym pairs, and bilingual synonym pairs mergedfrom two monolingual synonym lists.
Experimentalresults show that our approach achieves the F-scores1Shokubutsu (??)

The next section describes related work onsynonym extraction and spelling variations.
Section3 describes the overview and definition of bilingualsynonyms, the proposed method and employed fea-tures.
In Section 4 we evaluate our method and con-clude this paper.2 Related workThere have been many approaches for detecting syn-onyms and constructing thesauri.
Two main re-sources for synonym extraction are large text cor-pora and dictionaries.Many studies extract synonyms from large mono-lingual corpora by using context information aroundtarget terms (Croach and Yang, 1992; Park and Choi,1996; Waterman, 1996; Curran, 2004).
Some re-searchers (Hindle, 1990; Grefenstette, 1994; Lin,1998) classify terms by similarities based on theirdistributional syntactic patterns.
These methods of-ten extract not only synonyms, but also semanticallyrelated terms, such as antonyms, hyponyms and co-ordinate terms such as ?cat?
and ?dog.
?Some studies make use of bilingual corpora ordictionaries to find synonyms in a target language(Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Shimohata andSumita, 2002; Wu and Zhou, 2003; Lin et al, 2003).Lin et al (2003) chose a set of synonym candidatesfor a term by using a bilingual dictionary and com-puting distributional similarities in the candidate setto extract synonyms.
They adopt the bilingual in-formation to exclude non-synonyms (e.g., antonymsand hyponyms) that may be used in the similar con-texts.
Although they make use of bilingual dictio-naries, this study aims at finding bilingual synonymsdirectly.In the approaches based on monolingual dictio-naries, the similarities of definitions of lexical itemsare important clues for identifying synonyms (Blon-del et al, 2004; Muller et al, 2006).
For instance,Blondel et al (2004) constructed an associated dic-tionary graph whose vertices are the terms, andwhose edges from v1 to v2 represent occurrence ofv2 in the definition for v1.
They choose synonymsfrom the graph by collecting terms pointed to andfrom the same terms.Another strategy for finding synonyms is to con-sider the terms themselves.
We divide it into twoapproaches: rule-based and distance-based.Rule-based approaches implement rules withlanguage-specific patterns and detect variations byapplying rules to terms.
Stemming (Lovins, 1968;Porter, 1980) is one of the rule-based approaches,which cuts morphological suffix inflections, and ob-tains the stems of words.
There are other types ofvariations for phrases; for example, insertion, dele-tion or substitution of words, and permutation ofwords such as ?view point?
and ?point of view?
aresuch variations (Daille et al, 1996).Distance-based approaches model the similarityor dissimilarity measure between two terms to findsimilar terms.
The edit distance (Levenshtein, 1966)is the most widely-used measure, based on the mini-mum number of operations of insertion, deletion, orsubstitution of characters for transforming one terminto another.
It can be efficiently calculated by using458Term pairs Conceptp1 = (sho?mei (??

We consider abilingual synonym as a set of translation-equivalentterm pairs referring to the same concept.Tables 1 and 2 are an example of bilingualsynonym sets.
There are ten Japanese-Englishtranslation-equivalent term pairs and five bilingualsynonym sets in this example.
A Japanese term?raito?
is the phonetic transcription of both ?light?and ?right,?
and it covers four concepts described bythe three English terms.
Figure 2 illustrates the re-lationship among these terms.
The synonymous re-lation and the translation equivalence are consideredto be similar in that two terms share the meanings.Following synonymous relation between terms inone language, we deal with the synonymous relationbetween bilingual translation-equivalent term pairsFigure 2: Relations among terms in Table 2Solid lines show that two terms are translationequivalents, while dotted lines show that two termsare (monolingual) synonyms.as bilingual synonyms.
The advantage of manag-ing the lexicon in the format of bilingual synonymsis that we can facilitate to tie the concepts and theterms.3.1 DefinitionsLet E and F be monolingual lexicons.
We first as-sume that a term e ?
E (or f ?
F ) refers to oneor more concepts, and define that a term e is a syn-onym3 of e?(?
E) if and only if e and e?
share anidentical concept4.
Let ???
represent the synony-mous relation, and this relation is not transitive be-cause a term often has several concepts:e ?
e?
?
e?
?
e??
6=?
e ?
e??.
(1)We define a synonym set (synset) Ec as a set whoseelements share an identical concept c: Ec = {e ?E|?e refers to c}.
For a term set Ec(?
E),Ec is a synonym set (synset)=?
?e, e?
?
Ec e ?
e?
(2)is true, but the converse is not necessarily true, be-cause of the ambiguity of terms.
Note that one termcan belong to multiple synonym sets from the defi-nition.Let D(?
F ?
E) be a bilingual lexicon definedas a set of term pairs (f, e) (f ?
F, e ?
E) satis-fying that f and e refer to an identical concept.
We3For distinguishing from bilingual synonyms, we often callthe synonym a monolingual synonym.4The definition of concepts, that is, the criteria of decidingwhether two terms are synonymous or not, is beyond the fo-cus of this paper.
We do not assume that related terms such ashypernyms, hyponyms and coordinates are kinds of synonyms.In our experiments the criteria depend on manual annotation ofsynonym IDs in the training data.459call these pairs translation equivalents, which referto concepts that both f and e refer to.
We definethat two bilingual lexical items p and p?(?
D) arebilingual synonyms if and only if p and p?
refer to anidentical concept in common with the definition of(monolingual) synonyms.
This relation is not tran-sitive again, and if e ?

(3)because of the ambiguity of terms.
Similarly, wecan define a bilingual synonym set (synset) Dc asa set whose elements share an identical meaning c:Dc = {p ?
D|?p refers to c}.
For a set of transla-tion eqiuvalents Dc,Dc is a bilingual synonym set (synset)=?
?p, p?
?
Dc p ?
p?
(4)is true, but the converse is not necessarily true.3.2 Identifying bilingual synonym pairsIn this section, we describe an algorithm to identifybilingual synonym pairs by using spelling variationclues.
After identifying the pairs, we can constructbilingual synonym sets by assuming that the con-verse of the condition (4) is true, and finding setsof bilingual lexical items in which all paired itemsare bilingual synonyms.
We can see this methodas the complete-linkage clustering of translation-equivalent term pairs.
We can adopt another optionto construct them by assuming also that the bilingualsynonymous relation has transitivity: p ?
p?
?
p?
?p??
=?
p ?
p?
?, and this can be seen as simple-linkage clustering.
This simplified method ignoresthe ambiguity of terms, and it may construct a bilin-gual synonym sets which includes many senses.
Inspite of the risk, it is effective to find large synonymsets in case the bilingual synonym pairs are not suf-ficiently detected.
In this paper we focus only onidentifying bilingual synonym pairs and evaluatingthe performance of the identification.We employ a supervised machine learning tech-nique with features related to spelling variationsand so on.
Figure 3 shows the framework for thismethod.
At first we prepare a bilingual lexicon withsynonymous information as training data, and gen-erate a list consisting of all bilingual lexical itemFigure 3: Overview of our frameworkpairs in the bilingual lexicon.
The presence or ab-sence of bilingual synonymous relations is attachedto each element of the list.
Then, we build a classi-fier learned by training data, using a maximum en-tropy model (Berger et al, 1996) and the featuresrelated to spelling variations in Table 3.We apply some preprocessings for extractingsome features.
For English, we transform all termsinto lower-case, and do not apply any other trans-formations such as tokenization by symbols.
ForJapanese, we apply a morphological analyzer JU-MAN (Kurohashi et al, 1994) and obtain hiraganarepresentations5 as much as possible6.
We may re-quire other language-specific preprocessings for ap-plying this method to other languages.We employed binary or real-valued features de-scribed in Table 3.
Moreover, we introducethe following combinatorial features: h1F ?

method), and another is first5Hiragana is one of normalized representations of Japaneseterms, which denotes how to pronounce the term.
Japanese vo-cabulary has many of homonyms, which are semantically differ-ent but have the same pronunciation.
Despite the risk of classi-fying homonyms into synonyms, we do not use original formsof Japanese terms because they are typically too short to extractcharacter similarities.6We keep unknown terms of JUMAN unchanged.460h1F , h1E : Agreement of thefirst charactersWhether the first characters match or noth2F , h2E : Normalized editdistance1?

We implement thesetwo approaches and compare the results.
For identi-fying monolingual synonyms, we use features withbilingual items as follows: For a term pair e1 ande2, we obtain all the translation candidates F1 ={f |(f, e1) ?
D} and F2 = {f ?|(f ?, e2) ?
D},and calculate feature values related to F1 and/or F2by obtaining the maximum feature value using F1and/or F2.
After that, if all the following four con-ditions (p1 = (f1, e1) ?

Table 7 shows these results.
Contrary toour intuition, we found that features of agreementof the first characters (h1) remarkably degraded therecall without gains in precision.
One of the rea-sons for such results is that there are many casesof non-synonyms that have the same first character.We need to investigate more effective combinationsof features or to apply other machine learning tech-niques for improving the performance.
From theseresults, we consider that the features of h4 are effec-tive for improving the recall, and that the features ofh2 and h5 contribute improvement of both the pre-cision and the recall.
h3, h6, h7, and combinatorialfeatures seem to improve the recall at the expenseof precision.
Which measure is important dependson the importance of our target for using this tech-nique.
It depends on the requirements that we em-phasize, but in general the recall is more importantfor finding more bilingual synonyms.5 Conclusion and future workThis paper proposed a method for identifying bilin-gual synonyms in a bilingual lexicon by using cluesof spelling variations.
We described the notion ofbilingual synonyms, and presented two approachesfor identifying them: one is to directly predict therelation, and another is to merge monolingual syn-onyms identified, according to the bilingual lexicon.Our experiments showed that the proposed methodsignificantly outperformed the method that did notuse features primarily with spelling variations; theproposed method extracted bilingual synonyms withhigh precision and recall.
In addition, we found thatmerging monolingual synonyms by the dictionary iseffective for finding bilingual synonyms; there oc-cur few errors through the assumption described inSection 3.2.1.Our future work contains implementing more fea-tures for identifying synonymous relations, con-structing bilingual synonym sets, and evaluating ourmethod for specific tasks such as thesaurus construc-tion or cross-lingual information retrieval.Currently, the features used do not include otherclues with spelling variations, such as the weightededit distance, transformation patterns, stemming andso on.
Another important clue is distributional infor-mation, such as the context.
We can use both mono-lingual and bilingual corpora for extracting distribu-tions of terms, and bilingual corpora are expected tobe especially effective for our goal.We did not perform an experiment to constructbilingual synonym sets from synonym pairs in thispaper.
Described in Section 3.1, bilingual syn-onym sets can be constructed from bilingual syn-onym pairs by assuming some approximations.
Theapproximation that permits transitivity of bilingualsynonymous relations increases identified bilingualsynonyms, and thus causes an increase in recall anddecrease in precision.
It is an open problem to findappropriate strategies for constructing bilingual syn-onym sets.Finally, we plan to evaluate our method for spe-cific tasks.
For data-driven machine translation, it isexpected that data sparseness problem is alleviatedby merging the occurrences of low-frequency terms.Another application is cross-lingual information re-trieval, which can be improved by using candidateexpanded queries from bilingual synonym sets.AcknowledgmentsThis work was partially supported by Grant-in-Aidfor Specially Promoted Research (MEXT, Japan)and Japanese/Chinese Machine Translation Projectin Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Sci-ence and Technology (MEXT, Japan).
