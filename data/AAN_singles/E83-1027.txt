SYSTEMIC GRAMMAR IN COMPUTATION:THE NIGEL CASEChristian M.I.M.
Matthiessen,USC/Information Sciences Institute1 INTRODUCTIONComputational linguistics needs grammars for several differenttasks such as comprehension of text, machine translation, andtext generation.
1 Clearly, any approach to grammar 2 haspotentially something to offer computational linguistics, say forparsing or text generation (and, by the same token, there is apotential benefit from an application within computationallinguistics for each approach, cf.
\[Fawcett 80\]).
However, it isequally clear that some approaches have much more to offer thanothers.
Here I will take a look at Systemic Linguistics 3 in theservice of computational linguistics tasks, concentrating on a1This research was Supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific ResearchContract NO.

I am verygrateful to William Mann for many helpful comments on various versions of thispaper; much of the discussion builds on work by him.
f am also deeply indebted toMichael A.K.
Hallida~'; I have profited from and drawn heavily on his insights aboutEnglish grammar and semantics and the systemic framework.
I am solelyresponsible for all errors.2There are now in the early 80s a great number of grammatical mechanismsaround -- witness for example the 1979 Milwaukee conference on currentalternative approaches to syntax where around fourteen alternatives werepresented (see \[Moravcsik & Wirth 80\]).
a collecbon which is only a sample,leaving out many current approaches.
The term grammar is used in its traditionalsense in systemic linguistics: it subsumes both syntax and morphology.
This usecontrasts with the more recent one where grammar subsumes semantics, syntax,morphology, and phonology.3There are few grammatical mechanisms that have been developed within aframework with as impressive atradition as Systemic Linguistics and with as wide ascope.
The systemic framework is not just a non.transformational lternative toChomsky's transformational grammar.
It is different from Chomskyan work at thelevel of framework, not only at-the level of mechanism and notation.
Systemiclinguists ask questions like "How does communication succeed?
", "What are therelations between context and language use?".
"What can a speaker of English dogrammatically to achieve a particular purpose?".
"What are the options forexpressing grammatically a particular ange of meanings?
", "What functions doeslanguage serve?"
and so on.
These are questions that are crucial to the successot for example a text generation system.
One consequence of questions of thistype has been in Systemic Linguistics that text as a communicative unit is taken tobe the basic linguistic unit rather than the sentences that are used to express texts,see \[Hasan 78\] and \[Hasan 79\].
Obviously, this view has far-reaching effects onthe .
',)nception of grammar.
The systemic conception of language draws oncontinental European work, the British tradition started by Firth, and Americananthropological linguistics.
It has much to offer at a time when communication isbeginning to assert itself as a central organizing notion in linguistic researchinstead of the much more limited notion of (primarily syntactic) competence thatreceived so much attention for a long time in the CoOs.
but began to lose itsap~,arent attractiveness in the 70s.
For discussion of systemic grammar, see e.g.\[Ha!liday 69\], \[Halliday 76a\].
\[Hudson 76}.
\[Davey 79\], \[Berry 77\], \[Fawcett 80\], and\[Matthiessen 83\].large computational systemic grammar for text generation (Nigel)that is currently being developed.1.1 What can  sys temic  l ingu is t ics  o f fe r?The question I will try to answer in this paper is what systemiclinguistics can offer computational inguistics.
Since the answer is,I think, far too long for a short discussion, I will let a more specificquestion represent the general question here: What can systemiclinguistic accounts of grammar and semantics offer computationallinguistics in the area of text generation?
This question excludesfor example the use of systemic grammar in parsing -- see\[Winograd 72 \ ]  -- and the large systemic body of work ondiscourse organization (see in particular \[Halliday & Hasan 76\],\[Hasan 78\], \[Hasan 79\], \[Halliday & Hasan 80\], \[Martin 83\], and\[Butler 83\]).The text generation task raises a number of demands on thegrammatical component, Very roughly and generally stated, theyamount to generating in conformity with diverse needs, such asthe need for denotational appropriateness and the need for fluenttext.
There is no published general solution to the problem ofcontroll ing the grammar to generate in conformity with diverseneeds.
The discussion here continues and elaborates parts of\[Matthiessen 81\],1.2 Systemic  funct iona l i sm as a cont r ibut ionA cornerstone in systemic linguistics as developed by M.A.K.Halliday and others is systemic functionalism.
4 Grammar is to beinvestigated and interpreted in terms of the purposes it fulfills.
Itsorganization is a function of these higher-level considerations.Apart from guiding research in systemic linguistics, thisfunctionalism has been important in the design of systemicgrammar.
I will identify two design properties characteristic ofsystemic grammars that make them well suited to deal with thedemands, better than grammars that are not designed to reflectthe functionalism that the two ProPerties stem from.
The two4There are also strictly formal considerations having to do with the notationused.
These have been more central in work on e.g.
Lexical Functional Grammar,Functional Unification Grammar.
and Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar.
Theresults may or may not generalize to Systemic Grammar; that is a matter for futurediscussion.155properties have to do with the organization of grammar and withthe process of sentence generation; they constitute factorings ofthe sentence generation task.
One is a factoring into a process ofcontrolled choice and a process of structure specification as aconsequence of choices made.
This factoring is due to the needto represent the organization of grammar in its role as a resourcefor communicative needs.
The other is a {'actoring of thegrammatical resources into domains that serve different purposes(what will be called the mete-functional factoring).
I will use Nigelto illustrate how they work and what their value is in textgeneration Systems.
I will also present a completely new additionto systemic grammar, the so-called chooser framework, developedin the context of the text generation task.
51.3 Organization of the discussionFirst, I will sketch the steps in the process of text generation sothat the role grammar has to play can be identified (section 2).
Therest of the paper illustrates how systemic functionalism enablesgrammar to cope with tasks its role in the text generation processentails.
I will use the generation of a particular text realized by asingle sentence, Had Sir Christopher Wren been going to build acathedra/ ever since his youth?, as a way of illustrating andorganizing the discussion.2 THE TEXT GENERATION PROCESSIn this presentation of text generation.
I will follow an expositorydesign by William Mann (see \[Mann 83\]).
The model of textgeneration he gives an overview of is called Penman.
It has beendesigned for monologue only, without for example any facilities forcomprehension.
However, although Penman cannot take part in aconversation, I will present an example that corresponds to a turnin a dialogue; Penman will be assigned the task of asking aquestion in this illustration.
The reason for doing this is purelyillustrative; the task of asking a question is a concise way ofbringing out a number of features of the grammar,Assume that a need for a text has arisen.
In a conversationabout Sir Christopher Wren.
the need arises to know whetherthere was a plan for him to build a cathedral sometime after the5Functionalism in linguistics will hopefully be reconciled with goal reasoning asit has developed in computational linguistics and AI.
The term function has tworelated meanings in current lingu=stics, in addition to its strictly mathematicalsense.
One is "mete-function,'" which can be defined as the purpose or goal-- effect considerations that defines a particular component of the grammar.
Thesecond meaning of function is what Halliday has calted "micro-function".
This typeis the one that figures in traditional grammar .- subject, object, etc.
-- and more?
,c~,nt!,!
in for example Relational Grammar, Case Grammar, and LexicalFunctional Grammar Conceptually, micro-functions are very much like roles orslots used in semantic netS, (Micro vs. macro is here simply a distinction betweensmall and big; meta means that the functions are on another plane, not part of thestructure, in this way it is the same "mete" we find in for example "mete-language".)
For an interesting discussion of the development of mete-functionsand mi:ro-functions out of a set of macro-functions in early child language, see{Hal!iday 75}.
For some discussion of functional grammar, see e.g.
{Halliday 69\].\[Halliday 74\], \[Fawcett 80\], and \[Dik 78\].time when he was still a youngster.
The task of the text generatoris to satisfy this need.
(As we will see, one way of meeting thisneed is to ask Had Sir Christopher Wren been going to build acathedral ever since his youth?,) Three processes, Acquisition,Planning, and Sentence generation, work in text generationtowards meeting the need.2.1 Steps  in the text  generat ion  processGiven the need for text, the text generator identifies the goalsthat the text should pursue and acqu i res  the informationnecessary to pursue it.
This process is supported by a knowledgebase.
The goal is roughly that the addressee recognize that theinformation desired has been requested; in this case, we want tofind out whether Sir Chris had been going to build a cathedral ornot.Next, there is a process of text planning.
In response to the goalfor the text and the information acquired, a plan to achieve thegoal is created.
The planning process uses a rhetoric of textorganization to create the text plan.The plan consists of (among other things) conceptual loci (atleast one), each of which corresponds roughly to, an independentclause.
6 In the present example, a text with one such locus isplanned, a locus we can call CATHEDRAL-BUILDING.
It is up tosentence generat ion  to realize this plan, i.e., to find a wordingfor it.
The process of sentence generation does this, relying ongrammar  as its resource.
The remainder of the paper deals withthis part of the text generation process.
The grammar I will drawon for the rest of the discussion is the Nigel grammar, the systemictext generation grammar mentioned earlier.
72.2 The task for  sentence  generat ionThe sentence generation process can start when there is a fullyspecified local plan for CATHEDRAL-BUILDING in the text plan foran independent clause.
Such a plan includes among other things:.
A pointer to the process aspect of CATHEDRAL.BUILDING, called BUILDING in our example.?
A specification of the local speech act, here calledBUILDING.QUESTION; see the discussion of Moodbelow.?
A plan for temporal relations; cf.
the discussion ofTense below.6A traditional distinction between clause and sentence is maintained in systemiclinguistics.
A sentence can be defined simply as a complex of clauses, related bycoordination or subordination.7Although the text generation process can conveniently be factored into thethree subproceasas identified above, these subproceases are not necessarilysenally arranged.
There is one additional process, a orocess of improvement.
Forinstance, the quality of the output of sentence generation is evaluated and then,based on this evaluation, changes in the plan are proposed.156=-Possibly a specification of a specific conceptualcontext, defined temporally, spatially, in terms ofpurpose, or in some other way, to be indicated as apart of the organization of the text in terms ofconceptual contexts.
There is no such specificationfor the present example.?
Possibly a specification of a conjunctive relation (likecontrast, enumeration, temporal sequence,disjunction, and cause) to be expressed.
There is nosuch specification for the present example.A list such as this represents expressive demands, all of whichthe grammar of the sentence generation process has to cope with,but it imposes no structuring or factoring of this process.
The taskof the grammar and its semantics is to impose an organization ofand find a wording for the material relevant to the local plan.Consequently, it is quite helpful if the grammar of the sentencegeneration process is organized in such a way that the processcan be decomposed into manageable subprocesses.In what follows, I shall show how there is a natural factoring ofthe sentence generation process that derives from the systemicorganization of a grammar.
As we will see, this factoring is due tothe research programme (a consequence of systemic.~unctionalism) in systemic linguistics to uncover the functional?
organization of grammar and semantics and to reflect it insystemic notation.3 SYSTEMIC FACTORING OF SENTENCEGENERATIONThe design of systemic grammar is the result of a long-termeffort to create a grammatical framework that reflects thefunctional organization of grammar.
The important point to notehere is that the organization of systemic grammar leads naturallyto a factoring of the sentence generation process.
In other words,the systemic factoring of the sentence generation process is dueto the organization of systemic grammar,There are two simultaneous factorings that cross-cut:1.
The process of structure building is factored into twoprocesses, each of which with its own notation: Theprocess of choosing among grammatical alternatives(section 4.1) and the process of realizing, or re-expressing, a particular choice as a specification of afragment of grammatical structure (section 4.2).2.
The statements of grammatical choice, realizations ofchoice, and resulting structure are factored into threefairly independent processes: an ideational processof representing the speaker's experience, aninterpersonal process of specifying the interactionbetween speaker and hearer (in terms of speech actand role assignments), and a textual process ofenabling the two other ~3rocesses.
This is the meta-functional factoring; cf.
section 5.The meta-functional factoring is possible because of thenotations developed for choice and realization of choice intostructure as a configuration of functions.
Features originating indifferent meta-functions can be used to co,classify a grammaticalunit and functions from different meta-functions can be conflatedso that they apply to the same constituent in a structure.4 FACTORING INTO CHOICE ANDREALIZATION4.1 The process of choosingThe separation of statements of grammatical choice alternativesfrom structure specifications allows the grammar to have choiceas its central organizing principle.
The systemic network notationhas been developed to make statements 0f minimal grammaticalchoice points and statements about the inter-dependenciesamong these choice points possible.
The process of choice isitself factored into two parts: (i) Grammatical choice: thestatement of what the grammatical choice points and theirinterdependencies are -- the systemic network notation justmentioned -- and (ii) Semantic choice: statements about how toselect among the options of the grammatical choice points -- achooser semantics.4.1.1 Grammatical choiceEach choice point is represented by a system.
A system is adisjunction of two or more options (represented by grammaticalfeatures like Declarative, Past.
and Passive).
8 It has an entrycondition, which is the condition under which the choice isavailable.
As long as the condition has not been satisfied, nochoice can be made.
The condition is a Boolean combination offeatures (without negation, though) -- minimally a single feature.When the entry condition is satisfied, one of the feature optionsmust be chosen.
An example of a system is given below in Figure1.Together the systems of the grammar constitute a network ofsystems: The features that are the output of one system are partof the entry conditions of other systems.
The network as a wholerepresents the entire scope of the process of grammaticalselection; the individual systems represent the decomposition ofthis process into minimal choice points.
Below.
in Figure 2, thenetwork fragment for mood is presented; see section 6.4.1.2 Semantic choiceThe process of purposefully choosing among the feature optionsof a system is represented by a chooser or choice expert.
Thegrammar supplies us with linguistically justified control points, th'e8In systemic grammar, a distinction is usually (and always in work by Halliday)maintained between features and functions like SUBJECT, ACTOR, and THEME.Features are the building blocks of the paradigmatic organization of grammar, i.e,of grammar as choice.
Functions are the building blocks of the syntagmaticorganization, i.e.. of grammatical structure.
The distinction is not maintained inMartin Kay's Functional Unification Grammar (cf.
\[Kay 79\]).157systems.
Each system is assigned a chooser, which is a procedurecomposed of one or more steps leading to the determination ofwhich grammatical feature to choose.Where is the information relevant to the determination of whichoption should be chosen located?
As we have seen, in addition tothe grammar component, our text generation system has aknowledge base and a text plan for the text to be generated.We can call these components and other possible sources ofknowledge the environment of the grammar component.
It isfrom this environment hat a chooser demands the information itneeds in order to be able to choose one of the features of itssystems.
It demands this information by presenting formalinquiries to the environment.
9 An inquiry is asked of one or moreparameters.
The parameters are variables like PROCESS, GOAL,TEMPOo, and POLARITY for which conceptual values are identifiedin the generation of every grammatical unit.
As we will seepresently in section 4.2, grammatical structure is a specification ofgrammatical functions and the variables correspond to thosegrammatical functions.
The conceptual values are called hubs;they are concepts from which other concepts can be accessed.For instance, once a concept for a particular action has beenidentified, the participants in the action can be identified throughthe action concept.
The inquiries are the only interaction betweenthe choosers and the environment.4.2 The realization processThere is a separate notation for the realization process.Grammatical structure is defined in terms of relations that canhold between grammatical functions; grammatical structure is aconfiguration of functions like SUBJECT, PROCESS, ACTOR, andTHEME.
The relations (conflation, expansion, ordering; see below)are introduced by realization statements.
In the realizationprocess, a function structure is specified step by step: A smallnumber of realization operators operate on one grammaticalfunction, a combination of grammatical functions, t?
or agrammatical function and a set of features, tl A realizationstatements consisting of an operator and one or more operands isassociated with a particular grammatical feature in a system; whenthat feature is chosen, the realization statement can be activated.9These formal inquiries have informal versions that are informal questions inEnglish used for purposes of discussion and presentation.10The realization operations include Insert.
which inserts a function into thestructure being built, Expand, which specifies a constituency relation between afunction and one or more daughters, Order, which order two grammaticalfunctions, and Conflate, which states that two functions, say SUBJECT and AGENT,describe the same constituent.
Two functions are not ordered until it is clear thatthe ordering imposed is the final one.
There is thus no need for movementh ~;formations.
In fact.
there are no t ransfo rmations at all: A realization is onlystated at a point where it is clear that it represents the final state.11This latteP category of realization operator serves to state how the functionallydefined constituents of a particular structure, say clause structure or prepositionalphrase structure, are to be expressed grammatically or lexically.
We will meet theoperator Classify which associates a texical feature with a function; this feature is aconstraint on what lexecal items can realize the constituent that the functiondefines.Among the important properties of the realization process, wefind:?
The specification of structural presence (the insertionof a function into the structure being built) and thespecification of constituency relations are separatefrom ordering specifications.
For example, thespecifications of the presence of FINITE, the finiteverbal element of a clause, and SUBJECT are separatefrom specifications of their ordering.
Either can bespecified to follow the other and there is no need for atransformation to invert an original ordering.
Thisfollows the general tendency in the grammar towardsfactoring the realization (i.e., structure building)process into functionally motivated steps.
It is typicallythe case that the presence of a function and itsordering with respect to other functions serve twodifferent purposes??
There is a "unification" operator on functions, calledConflate, that enables the grammar to reconcilefunction structure fragments that are contributionsfrom areas of the grammar serving different purposes.For example, SUBJECT is conflated with differentfunctions depending on the voice of the clause-- ACTOR, GOAL, RECIPIENT, etc .
.?
Collections of features that determine how eachconstituent of e.g.
clause structure is further specifiedcan be built up step by step.
The features areassociated with functions.
Whenever two functionsare declared to describe the same constituent, i.e.,are conflated, their feature collections are merged.For instance, the auxiliary had has that form in ourexample because it serves both the function TEMPO owhich constrains it to be a past form and the functionTEMPO~ which constrains it to be a form of the auxiliaryhave.Now I will show in some more detail how the sentencegeneration process is organized.
I will use the example alreadyintroduced and structure the discussion around the meta.functional factoring of sentence generation.
We will see examplesof all the characteristics of the choice process and the realizationprocess identified above.5 META-FUNCTIONAL FACTORINGTo see how the multi-functional factoring works, we will return toour CATHEDRAL-BUILDING example and look at it first in aninterpersonal perspective, then in an ideational perspective, andfinally in a textual perspective.
Different perspectives draw ondifferent types of information in the environment.
The finalwording the grammar will give us is Had Sir Christopher Wrenbeen going to build a cathedral ever since his youth?.
We willconsider the three meta-functions identified above; eachcorresponds to a different "event".
There is the textual eventitself, the event or process of creating a text for the addressee thatenables the speaker to achieve his goals (the textual meta-function).
In addition, we have (i) the speech event, an act of158speaking involving speaker and addressee (the interpersonalmeta-function), and (ii) an event in the speaker's experience (realor imagined, recalled or projected) (s)he wants to represent (theideational meta.function).
125.1 In terpersona l  cho icesWhen they explore the part of the grammar that deals with theclause as interaction between speaker and hearer, choosers askquestions that have to do with some aspect of the speech act,such as: (i) Mood,  i.e., a classification of the speech act: Is thespeech act (BUILDING.QUESTION) a command?
Is the speech acta question?
I will use the mood area below to show in more detailhow the grammar works; see section 6.
(ii) Identity ofspeaker/hearer: What is the identity of the hearer?
Is the hearerincluded in the proposition?
Here there is no involvement ofspeaker/hearer.
(iii) The polarity of the speech act: Is the speechact a positive assertion or a denial?
For polarity in our example,see section 6.4.
(iv) The sincerity of the act: Is the assurance ofthe speaker's sincerity to be expressed?
Is a request for thebearer's sincerity to be expressed?
Here we do not have aspecification of a marking of sincerity.5.2 Ideational choicesSecond, consider the exploration of the clause as arepresentation of our experience.
Chooser questions hereconcern the structure and character of the conceptual situationwe are to represent.
(i) Transitivity, i.e., the organization of ourexperience as a process with one or more participants andpossibly attendant circumstances: Here we choose to representCATHEDRAL-BUILDING as an external process where one entity(SIR CHRIS) causes the building process, which effects, i.e.,brings into existence, another entity (CATHEDRAL).The function structure generated by realization statements thatre-express our choices as structure has as functional constituentsACTOR, PRocEss, and GOAL, all of which carry hub associations.ACTOR is associated with SIR CHRIS, PROCESS with BUILDING,and GOAL with CATHEDRAL.
In the final wording of the clause, SirChristopher Wren is the ACTOR of the clause, built the PROCESS,~nd this cathedral is the GOAL.
(ii) Tense, i.e., the organization of our experience in terms oftime relations: How is the event from our experience (here theCATHEDRAL.BUILDING event) to be related temporally to thespeech event?
This intricate question will be further examined insection 7 below.5.3 Textual cho icesFinally, let us look at the clause as a message, the textualperspective.
(i) Voice: Of two particular ideationally identified12These two events may overlap in various ways.
of course, as in so.calledperformative sentences.concepts, SIR CHRIS associated with ACTOR and CATHEDRALwith GOAL, which is conceptually closer the the topic of theparagraph being created?
Is the causer of the event to bementioned?
In our example, the concept WREN is the paragraphtopic and we get an active clause with a ?onflation of ACTOR andSUBJECT, i.e., ACTOR/SUBJECT.
(ii) Theme: For a particular ideational function, we ask if it serveas a conceptual context for the rest of the clause?
For example, itis determined that CATHEDRAL is not to serve this function.Similarly, for interpersonal functions.
Here, the conceptual contextin relation to which the remainder is interpreted is FINITE, anindication that the clause expresses a question about polarity.The different strands of functional reasoning hinted at above are ,unified into one structure as I will show below in section 8.Meanwhile, mood and tense will serve as representatives of thefull range of choices sketched in this section.6 INTERPERSONAL CHOICES: MOODMood is the interpersonal part of clause grammar that expressesthe role the speaker adopts and the role (s)he gives to theaddressee in terms of speech act.
I will present the choiceorganization of mood first, then the structural effects of differentchoices, and finally I will show how mood selections can becontrolled.6.1 Mood cho icesIn English there is a grammatical choice for clauses betweenimperative ones and indicative ones.
This choice of the mood of aclause is represented by the mood system; the two options thatconstitute the choice are represented by the features Imperativ~and Indicative.
Only clauses with a finite verb select for mood;infinitival and gerundial ones do not.
This fact is captured throughthe entry condition of the system, which says that if the clause isFinite.
the mood system can be entered.
A diagrammaticrepresentation of the system is given in Figure 1.FiniteIndicativei ImperativeKEY TO GRAPHIC NOTATIONEntry condition: "Finite"Feature options: "Indicative" and"Indicative"Figure 1: The moodsysteminEnglish?59The feature Indicative is the entry condition to the system ofIndicativeMood where the options are Declarativ@ andInterroaativ?.
There is an additional step.
The featureInterroaative is the input to the system InterrogativeType wherethe options are Whlnterroaative and Polaritv-lnterroaative.
Thisnetwork is represented diagrammatically in Figure 2.
The boxesunder the features in the diagram contain realization statements.Our example can be represented as a path through the networkfor mood.
The features Indicative, Interroaative, andPolaritv-lnterroqativ@ are selected in that order.
Each feature hasstructural consequences; the functional structure is built step bystep.6.2 Realizations and the structure of moodThe structural realization of mood is in the MOO0 constituent, afunction which embodies the mood or speechact aspect of theclause.
The internal structure of MOO0 expresses the moodselection of the clause.
13 The two principal daughters areSUBJECT and FINITE, the finite verbal element of the clause.
In1I}IIo00EEEf-F-E131ndicative clauses typically have a SUBJECT in English.
whereas imperativeones do not.
Consequently, there is a realization statement which says "insertSUBJECT" if the clause is !n,dicativ e. This means that the grammatical functionSUBJECT iS inserted into the grammatical structure being built.
There is no need todelete SUBJECT in imperative clauses; the function is never inserted unless it isactually expressed.Declarativ~ clauses, SUBJECT precedes FINITE; inPolaritv-lnterrooative clauses, FINITE precedes SUBJECT, aS in ourexample.In our example, the mood structure will be as diagrammed inFigure 3.
The constituent organization is the result of theapplication of (Expand MOOD SUBJECT) and (Expand MOOD FINITE).MOOD.

.I IFINITE SUBJECTHad Sir ChristopherFigure 3: Mood structure in polarity interrogative6.3 Semantic mood choicesEach system in the mood network is controlled by a chooser.For instance, the mood chooser of the mood system in Figure1 above, asks questions that identify information about the speechact of the clause to be generated.
Basically, if the intention is tocommand, the chooser chooses the feature Imoerativ~, otherwisethe feature Indicative.For our mood system the chooser interaction with theenvironment proceeds as follows:ENVIRONMENT CHOOSERI t  is not aIs the i l locut ionary point ofthe surface level speech actrepresented by BUILDING-QUESTION(MOOD) a command, i .e.
arequest by the speaker of anaction by thehearer?command.Then Ichoose feature Indicative.This is of course an informal dramatized representation of whatgoes on, but the dialogue illustrates the interaction betweenenvironment and chooser: The chooser presents a inquiry to theenvironment, the environment responds, and the chooser choosesa feature in conformity with the response.The inquiry above requests a classification of a hub, calledBUILDING-QUESTION in the example.
The BUILDING-QUESTIONhub is associated with the grammatical (micro-)function MOOD.Two additional inquiries establish that BUILDING-QUESTIONshould be expressed by an Interrooative clause and that this is aPolaritv-lnterroaative.1606.4 A note on polarityThe choice of mood determines how we choose polarity inEnglish.
In Polarity-interroaativE clauses, the choice betweenPositive, as in Had Sir Christopher Wren been going to build a.cathedral, and Neqative., as in Hadn't Sir Christopher Wren beengoing to build a cathedral?, is a choice that has to do with the biasin the reader's assumptions about which situation (s)he thinksobtains.In our example, an unbiased question is intended and Positive ischosen.
The realization of the choice is that the function FINITE isprohibited from being realized by a verb with the feature negative;it is outclassified for that feature: (Outclassify FINITE negative).We can symbolize this by associating ".negative" with FINITE.Notice that this realization constitutes a constraint on how theconstituent described by FINITE can be expressed.
As we will seein section 7, other constraints on the constituent come fromanother part of the grammar (the functions TEMPO o and TEMPO~).7 IDEATIONAL CHOICES: TENSEIndependent of and parallel with the grammar of mood is thegrammar of tense.
The two parts of the grammar originate fromtwo different meta-functions, the interpersonal one and theideational one.
147.1 Grammar of tenseIn English Indicative (;louses (cf.
the previous section), if they arenon.modal, there is always a specification of at least one relationof precedence between two times, one of which is the time ofspeaking.
This is the system of primary tense, whose options arePas__jt vs.
Present vs. Future..
The realizations of these features arestated in terms of the tense function TEMPO 0.
If Pa~t is chosen, therealization is (Classify TEMPO 0 past); if Future is chosen, therealization is (Classify TEMPO o will).
In the latter case, TEMPO o iS aseparate constituent, as in will build; in the former case TEMPO o iSfused, i.e.
conflated, with whatever verbal function follows to theright when Future is chosen -- as in built.
In English, the primarypresent tense is morphologically unmarked.It is possible to generate a more elaborate temporal verbalstructure, with more than one tense function:TEMPO o TEMPo t TEMPO zwill have ( jump )edThis is possible because the grammar of tense does not justcontain the system of primary tense, but also, in principle,indefinitely many systems of secondary tense (see especially14Note, however, that the full resources of tense are only at work in Indicativeclauses.
For example, we cannot (in English) request of an addressee the pastexecution of an action.\[Halliday 76b\]).
It is possible to iterate over tense options just as itis possible to iterate over tense operators in some tense logics.(Cf.
will have been going to leave and FPFp where p is aproposition and F and P are tense operators.)
The iterationdefines tenses of different orders, starting, with first order (orprimary) tense, then second order tense, third order tense, and soon.7.2 Tense choosersEach selection of Past, Present or Future corresponds to aspecification of a precedence relation between two times, T x andTy.
These times are concepts in Nigel's environment.
The task ofeach tense chooser is to establish what the current times to berelated are, i.e., a current T x and Ty pair, and what relationshipobtains between them.
This exploration proceeds in a step bystep fashion, guided by the grammar.In our example, there are four times: the time of speaking, calledNOW, a time prior to that which falls within the period of Sir Chris'slife under discussion, call it MATURE.TIME, a time prior to thatwhich falls within the period of his youth, call it YOUTH-TIME, andthe time of the building of a cathedral, call it BUILDING-TIME.
Thetemporal relations are represented in Figure 4.~ M A I  URE_TIN E ~~NOWYOUTH-TIME ~____..~ ING-T  IMEFigure 4: Temporal relationsThe tense functions receive hub associations.
First, TEMPO o and.TEMPO~ are  identified as NOW and MATURE-TIME respectively,then the following dialogue ensues:ENVIRONMENT CHOOSER.

This type of activity is repeated for the pair MATURE-TIME(TEMPO1) and YOUTH-TIME (TEMPO2) where the choice is a secor~dorder Pa~t and for the pair YOUTH-TIME (TEMPO2) and BUILDING-TIME (TEMPO3) where the choice is a third order F~Jture.
As aresult, we get three orders of tense.
(i), (ii), and (iii), therealizations of which are:161( i )  Pa$1~ (Classify TEMPO 0 past)( i i )  Pa@~ (Classify TEMPO I have)(Classify TEMPO 3 enparticiple)( i i i )  Fui~ure (Classify TEMPO 2 be going)(Classify TEMPO 3 to - in f in i t ive)To sum up: Both the process of choosing tense and the processof specifying a tense structure are factored into steps thatcorrespond to minimal temporal relations.
The tense functions areordered as a collection of tense functions: the sequence is iconicwith the order of tense; increase in order of tense corresponds tothe left to right sequenc e of tense functions.
Since there are nomore tense selections and no voice auxiliary, TEMPO 3 is conflatedwith PROCESS: (Conflate TEMPO 3 PROCESS) is activated.8 RECONCILIATION OF THE META-FUNCTIONS: STRUCTURAL RESULT8.1 Conflation of FINITE and TEMPO oThe two function structure fragments we have generated are(MOOD FINITE SUBJECT) and TEMPOc/TEMPO ~ TEMPO 2 TEMPO 3.Typically FINITE and TEMPO o conflate and the two fragmentscombine into the structure in Figure 5.
Similarly, as alreadyindicated, we have a conflation of TEMPO 3 with PROCESS.
The latterfunction is a transitivity function and carries feature informationabout the transitivity type of the verb (i.e, constrains build intransitivity), symbolized by the feature transitive.
Each one of thefunctions carries constraining feature information.As the figure indicates, there are two consequences of theconflation of FINITE with TEMPOo:1.
Feature constraints derived from independent choicesare merged and co-constrain the final expression.
Inother words, for polarity reasons, had appears as hadrather than hadn't, and for tense reasons, it appears inthis form rather than for example has, have, wi//, orwas.2.
The final sequence is a result of two independentordering specifications, viz.
the mood specificationthat FINITE comes before SUBJECT and the tensespecification of the ordering of tense auxiliaries.
Inother words, as a tense auxiliary, had precedes beengoing to build, and as the finite element of the clause,it precedes the subject.8.2 Other contributions to resultant clause structureOther aspects of the final structure come from transitivity, voice,theme etc.
(as we have seen in section 5):-From transitivity we get AcToR, PROCESS, and GOALwith feature specifications.-From voice we get the conflation of SUBJECT withACTOR.?
From theme we get the conflation of THEME withFINITE.TO sum up: Depending on the perspective we lay on the clause,the phrase Sir Christopher Wren will be SUBJECT (interpersonalperspective) or ACTOR (ideational perspective).
We say that thesefunctions are conflated (symbolized SUBJECT/ACTOR).
Theconflation is the result of bringing independent lines of reasoningtogether.
It is an operation that can only be performed onfunctions, not on categories like NP, N, and VP.
The resultantstructure is given in Figure 6 (associated features are left out).Note that had, Sir Chris, etc.
are not the result of equally manyfunctions.
Some constituent play a role only in one component(e.g.
tense: be going) whereas others realized more than onefunction (Sir Chris, for example).One important property of these conflations is that they couldhave been otherwise, if the choosers had received differentresponses f romthe environment and thus had made differentchoices.
For instance, we could have SUBJECT/GOAL and get theclause Had a cathedra/ been going to be built by Sir ChristopherWren.
Or, with a MODAL displacing TEMPO o in the conflation withFINITE: MODAL/FINITE followed by TEMPO c as in may have (insteadof had).FINITE SUBJECT-negative.

.Figure 6: Clause structure8.3 A note on the development of the function constituentsThe structure presented above represents clause structure; theterminal functions are functions of the clause.
It is the solution tothe problems that the clause has evolved to solve.
For thedevelopment of each constituent, we have to go to go either tolexicon or (back) to grammar.
The verbal have lexical featuresassociated with them and these features serve as constraints onwhat lexical items can be used.
The ACTOR constituent and theGOAL constituent have to go through another round ofdevelopment in the grammar, in the nominal group part of thegrammar.
Although I have not shown them, features are alsoassociated with these two constituents.
These features aregrammatical and will serve as constraints on choices in thenominal group part of the network.
This process is discussed ine.g.
\[Matthiessen 83\].9 CONCLUSIONThe first concise presentation of systemic suggestions waspublished when what came to be called ACL was being formed.Now, roughly twenty years later, with the first meeting of theEuropean chapter of ACL we can look back on substantialachievements in both computational linguistics and systemichnguistics, some of them in co-operation.However, the most exciting developments are current andfuture.
We can see the most ambitious applications of systemiclinguistics to computational tasks to date.
And we can see thegrowing interest in text generation, a task in the context of whichsystemic linguistics seems to have much to offer.Here I have.pointed to some properties and designs that comefrom the systemic tradition and which I think are of interest for thetext generation task.
Systemic linguists have done and are stilldoing pioneer work on text organization, turning up insights thatwill most certainly be important o the design of text generators.However, here.I have concentrated on contributions in the area ofgrammar and choosers for grammar with a view to showing howthey help us fulfill the demands place on a grammar in a textgenerator.
I have focused on the factoring of the sentencegeneration process that systemic grammar supports.References\[Berry 77\] Berry, M., Introduction to Systemic Linguistics, B.
