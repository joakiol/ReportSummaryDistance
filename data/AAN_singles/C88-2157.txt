Co l loeat iona l  Ana lys i s  in  Japanese  Text  InputMasaki YAMASHINA Fumihiko OBASHINTT Electrical Communication Laboratories1-2356 Take Yokosuka~shi Kanagawa-ken238-03 JAPANAbst ractThis paper proposes a new disambiguation method forJapanese text input.
This method evaluates candidate sen-tences by measuring the number of Word Co-occurrence Pat-terns (WCP) included in the candidate sentences.
An au-tomatic WCP extraction method is also developed.
An ex-traction experiment using the example sentences from dic-tionaries confirms that WCP can be collected automaticMlywith an accuracy of 98.7% using syntactic analysis and someheuristic rules to eliminate rroneous extraction.
Using thismethod, about 305,000 sets of WCP are collected.
A co-occurrence pattern matrix with semantic ategories is builtbased on these WCP.
Using this matrix, the mean number ofcandidate sentences in Kana.-to-Kanji translation is reducedto about 1/10 of those fi-om existing morphological methods.1 .
Introduct ionFor keyboard input of Japanese, Kana-to-kanji translationmethod \[Kawada79\] \[Makino80\] \[Abe86\] is the most popu-lar technique.
In this method, Kana input sentences aretranslated automatically into Kanji-Kana sentences.
How-ever, non-segmentcd Kana input is highly ambiguous, be..cause of the segmentation ambiguities of Kana input intomorphemes, and homonym ambiguities.
Some research asbeen carried out mainly to overcome homonym ambiguityusing a word usage dictionary \[Makino80\] and by using casegrammar \[Abe86\].A new technique named collocational analysis method, isproposed to overcome both ambiguities.
This evaluates thecertainty of candidate sentences by measuring the numberof co-occurrence patterns between word paix~.
It is usedin addition to the usual morphological nalysis.
To realizethis, it is essential to build a dictionary which can reflectWord Co-occurrence Patterns (WCP).
In English processingresearch, there has been an attempt \[Grishman86\] to col-lect semi-automatically sublanguage selectional patterns.
InJapanese processing research, there have been attempts \[Shi-rai86\] \[Tanaka86\] to collect combinations of words with thiskind of relationship, eittmr completely- or semi-automatically.These two attempts did not provide a dictionary for practicaluse.A new method is proposed for building a dictionary whichaccumulates WCP.
The first feature of this method is the col-lection of WCP from the common combination of two wordshaving a dependency relationship in a sentence, because thesecommon combinations will most likely reoccur in future texts.In this method, it is important o identify dependency re-lationships between word pai~s, instead of identifying, thewhole dependency structure of the sentence.
For this pur-pose, Dependency Localization Analysis (DLA) is used.
Thisidentifies the word pairs having a definite dependency rela-tionship using syntactic analysis and some heuristic rules.This paper will first describe oUocational nalysis, a newconcept in Kana-to-Kanji translation, then the compilation ofWCP dictionary, next the translation Mgorithm and finMlytranslation experimental results.2.
Concept  of  Co l loeat lona l  Ana lys i s  in Trans lat ionCollocationM analysis evaluates the correctness of a trans-lated sentence by measuring the WCP within the sentence.The WCP data is accmnulated in a 2-dimensional matrix, byinformation milts indicating more restricted concepts thanthe words can indica.te by themselves.As previously mentioned there are two kinds of ambigui-ties in Kana-to-Kanji translation.
In Fig.i, disambiguationprocess of homonyms is illustrated. '
NA;R (a nationalanthem) and ~\[~'~-  (to play)'  and ' NAg( (a state) aud~.~-~- ;5 (to build)' etc.
are examples of WCP.
If the simpleKana sequence ' ~_ -~ h~ ~- .~./~ ~ 5 ~" ;5 \[kokkaoensousuru\]' isinput, the usual translation system will develop two possiblecandidate words ' NJN ' (a national anthem) and ' NAg( (astate)', for the partial Kana sequence of ' ~ ~J h~ \[kokk@The system will also develop uniquely the creed(date word,' ~-?
;5 (to play) ' for '  R./~ <- -) -~- ;5 \[ensousumq'.
Thesecandidate words are obtained by table searching and mor-phologicM analysis.
Itowever, morphological analysis alonecan't identify which one is correct for ' ~.

Using WCP, ' NA ~ik ~ ~ ~ ~" -5 (to play a nationalanthem)' is selected as the final candidate sentence.
If theKana sequence' c o h~ ~ l:Y/b -t~ ~ ~" .5 \[kokkaokensetsusnru\]'is input, ' NA~-$k~:  ;5 (to build a state)' is obtained insame manner.E\] ~ Homonyms fo r  \[ ~'j~ -~ ~ I(Japanese\] ' ,Z-)~ ' (kokka) \ ] j ,~__~toptay)~.~'l~-I~ '  (nihon) L~ ~ V '~'~'~- ?

First, table-searching is done for all segmentation possibilities to get eachpart-of-speech of segment.
This' is carried out referring toindependent word ?dictionary (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.\[65,000 words\]), prefix and suffix dictionary \[1085 words\], de-pendent word dictionary (postpositions, auxiliary verbs, etc.\[422 words D, Then, among the morpheme sequences con-structed with each segment, the grammatically possible se-quences are selected.Next, the candidate sentences with the least number ofBunsetsu are selected \[Yoshimura83\].
Furthermore, amongtt~ese selected sentences, those which have the least number ofwords are selected.
In this process, a heuristic rule is used toprevent morPheme sequence mis-selection.
This rule rejectsthe combinations of nouns constructing a compound word, ifthe usage frequency of either nouns is very low.ex ,Input Kana sequence: 75~/b I;~ ~ 03 ~2 ~ \[kankeinonaka\]x ~ (noun) ~ (noun, freq.
: very low)(a relation) (in a field)O ~ (noun) o) (postposition) OO (noun, freq.
: high)(a relation) (among)Secondly, the co-occurrence pattern matrix is utilized inorder to determine the number of WCP within each candi-date sentence.
The counting operation is carried out only onadjacent Bunsetsu, because , in most eases, relationships arebetween adjacent Bunsetsu and determining extended rela-tionships would prove to be too time-consuming.Finally, the cand{date sentence with the maximum WCPnumber is chosen as the prime candidate.
To prevent mis-taken deletion of prime candidates caused by word pairs whichrarely co-occur, following rule is used.
If the usage frequencyof either word in WCP is low, the,candidate sentences ofwhich WCP number is less one than maximum number, arealso identified as prime candidates.
In following example,both are identified as prime candidates.

Conclus ionA method for disambiguation based on colloeal;ional nalysis of non-segmented Kana-to-Kanji translation has be(m de-veloped.
To realize this, an automatic WCP dictionary coi c.-pilation method has also been developed.
In an extractio~experiment using example sentences fl'om dictionm'ie,q, it wm~confirmed that WCP can be collected automatically wiflt a98.7% accuracy using syntactic anMysis and some heu.cistierules to eliminate rrors.
Using this method, about 305,000sets of WCP were collected.
The co-occurrence patterrt m~trix was built based on these WCP mid used in b'artslat.ionexperiments.Experimental results show that tim mean umnber of can.didate sentences i reduced to about 1/10 of those fl:om exist-ing morphological methods and that a translatitm acem'~my ~i?
