Pangloss: A Machine Translation ProjectSergei NirenburgCenter for Machine TranslationCarnegie Mellon UniversityPittsburgh, PA 15213The project involves three sites (NMSU, USC, CMU) and isdevoted to enhancing the state of the art in machine translationof natm'al language texts.Pangloss uses a hybrid, multi-engine approach, thoughknowledge-based machine translation takes a majority of re-sources.Types of work in the knowledge-based direction include:?
continuing development of a set of knowledge acquisi-tion tools and utilities to support the above work.?
building high-quality syntactic, semantic and prag-matic analyzers for the source languages (Spanish andJapanese);?
developing a high-quality text planner and generator forthe target language (English);?
designing a highly-expressive text meaning representa-tion language (the interlingua) in which the results ofanalysis and input to generation are recorded;?
putting togethera detailed domain model ("ontology")and, for each of the languages involved, a lexicon whichmaps lexical units of respective languages into elementsof the world model and a grammar.Other types of work includes?
developing an example-based machine translation en-gine, a first system of this kind to attempt processing offull text rather than specific examples;?
developing a back-up lexical transfer system based ona battery of glossaries, dictionaries, gazetteers, etc.
andfortified with morphological nalysis and synthesis rou-tines;?
developing a mechanism for integrating the results of themultiple MT engines in a hybrid, multi-engine system;?
continuing development, deployment and testing of ahuman-computer interface, a translator's workstation,to support postediting and interactive editing during theoperation of the translation system; and450
