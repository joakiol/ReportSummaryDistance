PHRASE STRUCTURE TREES BEAR MORE FRUIT THAN YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT*Aravind K. Joshi and Leon "S." LevyDepartment of Computer and Bell Telephone LaboratoriesInformation Science Whippany, NJ 07981The Moore School/D2University of PermsylvaniaPhiladelphia, PA 1910BEXTENDED ABSTRACT**There is renewed interest in examining the descriptiveas well as generative power of phrase s~-~uctur~ gram-mars.
The primary motivation has come from the recentinvestigations in alternatives to t-~ansfor~ationalgremmmrs \[e.g., i, 2, 3, 4\].
We will present severalresults and ideas related to phrase structure treeswhich have significant relevance to computational lin-guistics.We %~_nT to accomplish several objectives in this paper.I.
We will give a hrief survey of some recent resultsand approaches by various investigators including, ofcourse, our own work~ indicating their interr~laticn-ships.Here we will review the work related to the notion ofnode admissibility starring with Chomsky) followed bythe work by McCawley, Peters and Ritchie, Joshi andLevy, a~d more recent work of Gazdar.We will also discuss other amendments to context-freegrammars which increase the descriptive power but notthe generative power.
In particular, we will discussthe notion of categories with holes as recently intro-duced by Gazdam \ [3\] .
There is an interesting historybehind this notion.
Sage~'s parser explieitly exploitssuch a convention and, in fact, uses it to do some co-ordinate st-ructnK-a computation.
We suspect that someother parsers have this feature also, perhaps ~plicit-ly.
We will discuss this matter, which obviously isof great interes~ to computational linguists.2.
Our work on local constraints on st-r~/cin/ral descrip-tions, \[5, 6\], which is ccmputationally relevant bothto linguistics and programming language theory, hasart-~'acted some attention recently; however, the demon-srration of these results has re~.ained somewhat inac-cessible to many due to the technicalities of the treeautomata theory.
Recently, we have found a way ofproviding an intuitive explanation of these results interms of intel"acting finite state machines (of the ,usual kind).
Besides providing an intuitive and a moretransparent explanation of our results, this approachis computationally more interesting and allows us toformulate an interesting question: How large a variableset (i.e., the set of nonterminals) is required for aphrase slx~cture grammar or how much information doesa nontermdmal encode?
We will present this newapproach.3.
We will present some new results which extend the"po~er" of local constraints without affecting the chax~acter of earlier results.
In particular, we will showThat local constraints can include, besides the pmope~analysis (PA) predicates and domination (~)  pmadicates,* This work was partially supported by NSF grant MCS79-08401.
** Full paper will be available at the time of themeeting.mor~ complex predicates of the following form.
(1) (PRED N 1 N 2 ... Nn)where N I, N2, ... N n are nonterminals mentioned in thePA and/or ~ constraint of the rule in which (i) appearsand PR~ is a predicate which, r~ughly speaking, checksfo~ certain domination or left-of (or right-of) rela-Tionships among its arguments.
Two examples of inTer~est are as follows.
(2) (CCOFMAND A B C)CC0~LND holds if B immediately dominates A and B domi-nates C, not necessarily ~ ia te ly .
Usually the Bnode is an S node.
(3) (LEFTMOSTSISTER A B)LEFTMOSTSISTER holds if A is the leftmost sister of B.We will show that introduction of predicates of the type(I) do not change the character of our result on localcons~-raints.
This extension of our earlier work hasrelevance to the forTm~ation of some long distance ruleswithout %-mansformations (as well as without the use ofThe categories with holes as suggested by Gazdar).We will discuss some of the processing as well as lin-guistic relevance of these results.4.
We will tr~y to compare (at least along two dimen-sions) the local const-raint approach to that of Gazdar's(specifically his use of categories with holes) and tothat of Peters' use of linked nodes (as presentedorally at Stanford recently).The dimensions for cc~ison  would be (a) economy ofrepresentation, (b) proliferation of categories, by andlarge semantically vacuous, and (c) computational rele-vance of (a) and (b) above.5.
Co~positional semantics \[8\] is usually context-free,i.e., if nodes B and C are immediate descendants ofnode A, then the semantics of A is a composition (de-fined appropriately) of the semantics of B and semanticsof C. Semantics of A depends only on nodes B and C andnot on any other part of the st-ruerural description inwhich A may appear.
Our method of local constraints(and to sQme extent Peters' use of linked nodes) opensthe possibility of defining the semantics of A not onlyin terms of the semantics of B and C, but also in termsof sc~e parts of the sZ~-uc~ description in which Aappears.
In this sense, the semantics will be contex-t-sensitive.
We have achieved some success with ThisaFpLuaeh to the semantics of p rogr~g languages.
Wewill discuss some of ou~ preliminary ideas for extendingthis approach to natural language, in particular, inspecifying scopes for variable binding.6.
While developing our theory of local constrains andsome other related work, we have discovered that it ispossible to characterize structural descriptions (forphrase sl-r~crure gz%m~mars) entirely in terms of treeswithout any labels, i.e., trees which capture the group-ing structure wi~hou~ the syntactic categories (which isthe same as the constitn/ent st-r~cture without the nodelabels \[7\].
This is a surprising result.
This result41provides a way of deter~ how much " ~ "~zerm/nels  (syntactic cazeEories) encode and there-fore clearly, it has ca~at icna l  s i~ icance .Moreover, ~o The extent That The cla/m ~ha~ naturallanguages ere conzex~-bree is valid, this result hassignificant z~levancs to leamabili~y ~\]~eories,because our result suEges~s that it might be possibleto "infer" a phrase s~ruc'~r,e ~ L,-,, jus~ thegrouping s~ruc~ure of ~he input (i.e., j us~phrase boundaries).
Pur~her, the set ofdescrip~iuns wit.bout labels are directly rela~ed tothe ~ descz'ip~ic~s of a context-free Eramn~z-;hence, we may be able to specify '~aTural" syntacticcategories.In summery, we will prese~1: a selectian of mathematicalresul :s  which have s i sn i f j~ ln t  z~l.evancs to m=~y aspec~of con~t iona l  lin~is~ics.SELECTED R ~ 2 ~\[I\] Bresnan, J.W., '~vidence for an unbounded T/leory of~z~nsformations," k i~ ic  Analysis, Vol.
