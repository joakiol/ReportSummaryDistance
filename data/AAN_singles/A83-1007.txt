Friedman***Department of Computer Science, New York UniversityNew York, NY 10012+Federal and Special Systems Group, Burroughs Corporat ionPaoli, PA 19301**Linguist ic String Project, New York UniversityAbstractIsolating the domain-dependentinformation within a large naturallanguage system offers the generaladvantages of modular design and great lyenhances the portabi l i ty of the system tonew domains.
We have explored the problemof isolating the domain dependencieswithin two large natural language systems,one for generating a tabular data basefrom text ("information formatting"), theother for retrieving information from adata base.
We describe the domaininformation schema which is used tocapture the - -d~n-spec i f i c  information,and indicate how this information is usedthroughout the two systems.PrologueComputational l inguistics is aninteresting blend of science andengineering.
It is science insofar as weare trying to understand a natural process-- verbal communication.
It isengineering insofar as we are trying tomanage complexity -- the complexity which,from our present viewpoint, seems inherentin natural language systems.One tool we have for managingcomplexity is modular design -- dividing alarge system into components of manageablesize.
This may mean, in particular,separating procedures from knowledgesources and then separating differentsources of knowledge.
If we "factor m oursystem in an appropriate way, we may beable to reduce the size not just ofindividual components but of the system asa whole.
Because of our involvement withlarge natural language systems, we havelong been concerned with these issues ofmodularity \[Grishman 1980\].
Attackingsubstantial natural language appl icat ionswill require that we scale up our alreadylarge systems, and we believe that thiswill be feasible only with systems whichhave been careful ly divided into modules.46One such divis ion is the separationof domain-speci f ic  knowledge (sometimescalled "world knowledge") from knowledgeof the language in general.
Such adivis ion not only confers the usualadvantages of modular i ty  in faci l i tat ingdevelopment of a system for a singleappl ication, but also greatly enhances theportabi l i ty of a system to new domains.Portabi l i ty is especial ly  enhanced if thedomain-speci f ic  information can beempir ical ly veri f ied and its d iscovery atleast part ial ly automated.
What werequire is a compact representat ion of thedomain-specif ic  information needed by thecomponents of a natural language system,in a form which can be eff ic ient lyuti l ized by these components.
Before wereview our own efforts in this direction,a few historical comments are in orde~ onisolating domain-dependent information.In the early 1970's, the primeconcern for most designers was gettingthese domain-speci f ic  ("semantic")constraints into their system; littleemphasis was placed on isolating thisinformation from the rest of the system.For example, in the LUNAR system theconstraints of operating in a moon rocksworld were interwoven with the semanticinterpretation procedures \[Woods 1972\].Interestingly, one trend of the mid-70'swas a tighter integration ofdomain-speci f ic  constraints with generalgrammatical constraints,  in the form ofsemantic grammars \[Burton 1976\].
Bymerging grammatical  and 'semantic'constraints, semantic grammars faci l i tatedthe construct ion of small natural languagesystems.
On the other hand, they impededthe capture of grammatical  regularit ies;adding a new syntactic pattern (e.g.,reduced relatives) might require addingdozens of productions (one for eachal lowable combination of semanticclasses).
They also made it dif f icult  totransport a system to a new domain.
As aresult, the most recent trend has beentowards a careful isolation ofdomain-specif ic knowledge (e.g., the RUSSystem \[Bobrow 1980\]).
In particular,some groups which developed substantialsemantic-grammar-based systems, such asLADDER at SRI \[Hendrix 1978\] and PLANES atthe Univ.
of I l l inois \[Waltz 1978\], havenow developed syntactic grammars withseparate domain information components.Our systemsFor all of the reasons mentionedabove -- reduced size and complexity,better capture of grammaticalregularities, greater portabil ity,empirical veri f iabi l i ty -- we have beenworking fOE the past few years to factorout the domain dependencies from two largenatural language systems.
One of these isa system for information formatting -- themapping of natural language text into atabular data base, for subsequent use ininformation retrieval and statisticalanalysis; this system has been used toprocess radiology reports and hospitaldischarge summaries \[Sager 1978, Hlrschman1982b\].
The other is a question-answeringsystem for data retrieval from relationaldata bases, including in particular thosegenerated by information formatting\[Grishman 1978\].In both systems the initialprocessing -- parsing and transformationaldecomposit ion -- is performed by theLinguistic String Parser \[Sager 1981\].
Informatting, the transformational lyregularized parse tree is mapped into aninformation format; the format is then"normalized" to  recover  zeroed  informationand analyze the time structure of thenarrative \[Hirschman 1981\].
Forquestion-answering the operator-operandtree (produced by transformationaldecomposition) is first translated into alogical form based on first-orderpredicate calculus; anaphoric phrases areresolved; the logical form is translatedinto a data base retrieval request; thedata is retrieved; and, if necessary, afull-sentence answer is generatedincorporating the retrieved data.The domain information schema (DIS)The domain-dependent information usedby our systems has two basic aspects.First, it characterizes the structure ofthe information in the domain.
Second, itspecifies the correspondence between theinformation structures as they appear inthe text and the various internalrepresentations of information in thesystem.We call the characterization of thestructure of information in the domain adomain information schema or DIS \[Grishman1982\].
This characterization consistsprimarily of a set of semantic classes,the words and phrases which are members ofthese classes, and the allowablepredicate-argument relationships among47these classes in this domain.
Forexample, a schema for a medical domainwould contain classes such as PT(patient), VPT (patient-verb), INDIC(indicator of sign or symptom), andBODY-PART:PT VPTpatient experiencept complain ofINDIC BODY-PARTswelling abdominalstiff neck.
.

.
.
.and pred icate -argument  pat terns  such asverb -sub jec t -ob jec t :VPT PT INDICcomplain of patient swellinghost-adjective:BODY-PART INDICneck stiff(here class names are given in upper caseand members of the classes in lower case).Certain other properties of thesepredicates, such as functionaldependencies among arguments, are alsoincluded in the DIS.
For example, in themedical domain there is a functionalrelationship from tests to patientsbecause each test is of one and only onepatient.
The DIS is thus similar to database schemata and to the frame-slotstructures of frame-based systems.Usin@ the DISThe domain information schema is usedmost extensively in the parsing stage ofthe two systems.
The predicate-argumentconstraints of the DIS yield a sublanguagein the sense of Harris \[Harris 1968\].These constraints are enforced by a set ofselectional restrictions added to theLinguistic String Project English grammar.The task of enforcing these constraints iscomplicated by the wide variety of surfacestructures in which a subject-verb-objectpattern may appear: declarative,interrogative, and imperative sentences;active and passive voice; in mainclauses, relatives, and reduced relatives;etc.
The complexity of the restrictionsis reduced by the power of the RestrictionLanguage to operate in terms of the stringrelations (e.g., subject-verb-object orhost-modifier relations) \[Sager 1975\], butit is still substantial.
The virtue ofthis approach, however, is that theserestrictions are essential ly constantacross sublanguages, while the DIS, whichwill change and grow for new applications,is kept to a minimum.The following sentence fragmenti l lustrates the use of selectionalrestr ict ions to obtain the correct parse:Blood cultures obtained in thevisit to the emergency roomprior to admission.Here the problem is the placement of thepreposit ional phrase prior to admission,which could modify the d~r'-~ct--~y adjacentnoun phrase (the emergency room), but infact modif ies the preceding noun phrasethe visit.
The select ion forprepositlon"-o~-\[ phrases on their hosts isgiven by the P-NSTGO-HOST list (part ofthe DIS).
The portion of this listrelevant fo~ the preposit ion prior to is:Prep.
Object o_ff Host ofPrep.
Prep.
phrasePREPTIME: (INDIC: (INDIC,TEST,VMD,VPT,VTR,VSHOW,VHAVE),TEST: (INDIC,TEST,VMD,VPT,VTR,VSHOW,VHAVE),VMD: (INDIC,TEST,VMD,VPT,VTR,VSHOW,VHAVE),---),This list contains the information that atime preposit ion (PREPTIME, e.g., priort_~o) can appear with a VMD (medical actionword) as its preposit ional object (e.g.,prior to admission), with thepreposit ional phrase modifying another VMDword (e.g., visit); this corresponds tothe P-NSTGO-HOST patternPREPTIME: (VMD: (VMD)).
There is nopattern PREPTIME: (VMD: (INST)) whichwould allow prior to admission to modifythe INST word (inst--\[tution word) emergencyroom.
The appl ication of the selectionalconstraints ensures that the incorrectparse will be el iminated and the correctone produced.In order to verify these constraints,the restr ict ions must determine thesemantic class membership of the nounphrases in the sentence.
Usually theclass of a noun phrase is that of the"core" noun of the phrase.
In certaincases, however, the class of the nounphrase as a whole is a function of theclasses of both core and adjunct.
Forinstance, a BODY-PART word modif ied by anINDIC word becomes an INDIC phrase, as instiff neck.
In some cases, the core is"transparent" and the class of the nounphrase is determined by the class of itsright or left adjunct, so that, forexample, onset of swelling would be in thesame class as swelling.
To accommodatethese situations, the DIS contains rulesfor such phrasal or "computed" attr ibutes(see the N-LN-COMP-ATT and N-RN-COMP-ATTlists in the appendix).
Each time a nounis encountered which can part ic ipate in acomputed attribute construction, itsadjuncts are checked and, if ~pprcp La e,a computed attr ibute is assigned to beused in further selectional restr ict ions.The selectional restr ict ions serve toexclude many incorrect but syntact ical lywel l - formed parses.
Constraints oncoordinate conjunct ion (requiring theconjoining of phrases from identical orsimilar semantic classes), acting togetherwith the computed attr ibute mechanism,serve to reduce the structural  ambiguityof conjoined constructs,  always a seriousproblem \[Hirschman 1982a\].
The nounphrase anorexia and onset of a stiff necki l lustrates this process.
There are twopossible parses for this phase, namely(anorexia and onset) of a stiff neck,which is incorrect; and the correctanalysis (anorexia) and (onset of a stiffneck).
The con junct ion mechanism--r~quirest a~on ly  "similar = elements be conjoined;this rules out the conjunct ion of anorexia(an INDIC word) and onset (a BEGIN word).However, the phrase s~-~neck  receives acomputed attr ibute INDIC; and onset is"transparent",  so it receives a computedattr ibute INDIC from its right adjunctstiff neck.
Therefore the entire nounphrase onset of a stiff neck has acomputed at-'~-6"{~but"e INDIC, and can conjoin(as a phrase) to anorexia, giving thecorrect parse.In addition, these select ionalpatterns can be used to resolve mosthomographs, that is, to determine theclass assignment of words which aremembers of several classes.
For example,the word in~ection is ambiguous: it canmean inflammation (an INDIC word), as inthroat in~ection, or it can mean shot (aVTR word), as in penici l l in injection.The DIS enables a homograph to bedisambiguated, provided that suff ic ientcontext is present.
For example, in thephrase throat injection, the combinat ionINDIC: (BODY-PART) is al lowed in thecompound noun (N-NPOS) relation, whereasthe combinat ion VTR: (BODY-PART) is notallowed (see the appendix for the N-NPOSlist).
This d isambiguat ion is importantbecause the subsequent mapping into aninternal representat ion ( informationformat or predicate calculus expression)is dependent on the correct identi f icat ionof the semantic class of eachinformation-carrying word.The anaphora resolution procedure inthe quest ion-answering system reliescrucial ly on the DIS.
The same mechanismwhich uses context to resolve homographsalso serves to determine the possibleclass assignment(s) for an anaphoricphrase.
For example, if given thequestionDid it show swell ing?~8the procedure would consu l t  the DIS todetermine  what c lasses  o f  sub jec ts  canoccur w i th  a VSHOW verb (show) and anINDIC object (swelling).
The DIS(Appendix, section 2) indicates that thesubject in this context can be a BODY-PARTor a TEST.
The anaphora resolutionprocedure then searches the cur rent  andprior sentences  fo r  an antecedentbelonging to one of those classes.The DIS a l so  p lays  a ro le  in  thet rans la t ion  of  quer ies  in to  pred icatecalculus.
Specifically, the informationon functional dependencies betweenarguments of predicates is used indetermining the scope of quantlf lers andcon junct ions .
Consider the fo l low ing  twosentences ,  which have s imi la r  syntact i cstructures:(1) How many pat ients  have hadan X - ray  and a b iopsy?
(2) How many biopsies didpatient X and patient Y have?The first question asks for a singlenumber; in other words, the scope of howman~ is wider than the scope of and.
T-~second question, however, asks for twonumbers: the number of biopsies X had andthe number Y had; in this case, the scopeof and is wider than that of how many.
Weknow that this is the on-~ possibleinterpretation of the second questionbecause there are no "group biopsies" --each biopsy is of one and only onepatient.
This fact is encoded in the DISas a functional dependency from TEST to PT(patient) in the triple VHAVE-PT-TEST.
Byusing this functional dependencyinformation, the system is able to assignthe correct interpretation to the twoquestions.A further application of the DIS (notyet implemented) is the retrieval of"implicit" or omitted information.
Forexample, certain compound nounconstructions can be considered to resultfrom the omission of the connector betweenthe two nouns.
In these cases, it may bepossible to use the verb-subject-objectlist of the DIS to identify the omittedverb.
This can be done by assuming thatthe head noun of the compound noun phrasewill be the subject of the verb, and themodifying noun the object.
Thus, giventhe phrase infectious disease consultant,we have a compound noun whose head is thethe DOCTOR class, and the modifying nounin the INDIC class.
If we search theV-S-O list of the DIS (see appendix) forcandidate verbs, we find that a verb ofclass VTR (treatment) can take a DOCTORsubject and an INDIC object.
If, inaddition, each class has a dist inguished"default" member (e.g., treat for the VTR49class), it may be possible to regularizethe compound noun by restoring the omittedinformation (infectious disease consultant<= consultant who treats infectiousd isease) .Generat ing  In terna l  Representat ionsThe semantic classes, and thesubject-verb-object and host-adjunctpatterns are also used to specify thecor respondence between the textua l  andin terna l  representat ions .In the current information format forhospital records, most classes map i n to  aunique format column.
The formattingprocedure records this correspondence as allst of semantic class - format columnpairs.
For some modifiers, however, suchas time modifiers, aspectuals, andnegation, the placement of the modifier inthe format depends on the class (and hencethe placement) of the host; specialtransformstlons are provided for thefo rmat t ing  of  these mod i f ie rs .The questlon-answering system hasprovided sl ightly greater general itywithin a two-stage mapping.
Syntact ical lyanalyzed queries are first mapped into anextended predicate calculus.
For eachsubject-verb-object and host-adjunctpattecn in the DIS, we specify a predicate(or set of predicates) and acorrespondence between syntactic roles(subject, object, sentence adjunct) andargument positions.
Later (after anaphoraresolution)the pred icate  calculus expression ismapped i n to  a retrieval request on theinformation format; each predicate isdefined as a projection of the informationformat.Automated verif ication and discover ZproceduresOne of the attractive features of theDIS is that it is empirical ly verifiable;some of our current research alsoaddresses the possibi l i ty of (at leastpartial) automation of a discoveryprocedure for portions of the DIS.Semantic classes can be identified withina sublanguage, using techniques ofdistr ibution analysis \[Hirschman 1975\] :for each pair of words in a parsed,regularized sample corpus of asublanguage, a similarity coeff icient iscomputed based on how many commonsyntactic environments the two wordsoccurred in (e.g., as the subject of thesame verb).
"Clusters" of similar wordsare then formed by grouping together wordswhose similarity coeff icients exceed acertain threshold value.
This techniquehas been used to identify the frequentlyoccurring members of the major semanticclasses of a radiology report domain.Given the semantic classes, it isthen possible to identify the selectionalpatterns, simply by recording thosepatterns that occur in (good) parses.This provides veri f ication of the DISselectional patterns.
It also allowscol lection of data on the relativefrequency of occur rence  of the variouspatterns.
The frequency data would permituse of a weighting algorithm, in order to"prefer" a parse with more frequentlyoccurring patterns to an alternate parsewith less frequently occurring patterns.The "preferential" approach may allowsignif icant enhancement Of parsingrobustness compared to the "accept/reject"approach currently used.
(In the"accept/reject" approach, a parse iseither acceptable, or if it violates anyconstraints, it is rejected; there is nonotion of "relative goodness" of severalparses).
The preferential  approach wouldbe part icularly useful for incrementaldevelopment of a DIS in a new sublanguage,where only partial data on selectionalpatterns is available, and also in highlynon-determinist ic parsing, such as speechunderstanding.One of the issues in automating thediscovery procedure for the selectionalpatterns of the DIS is how to preventpatterns from bad parses from beingincluded in =he DIS (and thus allowingeven more bad parses).
The use ofweighted patterns may provide a means forautomating the discovery of the DIS, since"correct" patterns are more likely tooutnumber random "incorrect" patterns frombad parses.
These issues are the subjectof an ongoing research project.Discussionof our systems.
Our experience with therather different student transcript database has indicated that not all domaindependencies have yet been isolated,part icularly in specifying the mappingfrom textual to internal representation.Problems arose with the character izat ionof sentence adjuncts, units of time(semesters instead of days and months),and nouns or noun phrases implyingcomputations (grade point average,enrol lment),  which we intend to rectifyshortly by enriching the DIS.Our experiments also indicated thatrelatively l imited domain-speci f icinformation (primarily a character izat ionof the structure of information in adomain, rather than specif ic facts aboutthe domain) can be adequate for certainnatural language appl icat ions, such asthose described.
Problems arose moreoften because the selectional constraintswere too "tight" than because constraintsdeducible from specif ic facts of thedomain were not available.
As a result,we are now beginning to experiment withthe automatic selective relaxation ofthese restr ict ions in order to improveparsing performance.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported in partby National Science Foundation grants MCS80-02453 from the Division of Mathematicaland Computer Sciences and IST 81-15669from the Division of Information Scienceand Technology; in part by NationalLibrary of Medicine grant I -R01-LM03933,awarded by the National Institutes ofHealth, Department of Health and HumanServices; and in part by Office of NavalResearch contract N00014-75-C-0571, NR049-347.Both systems described above havebeen extensively tested.
