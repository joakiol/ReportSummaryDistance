A imWe seek  a fo rmal  recogn i t ion  procedure  that  w i l l  enab le  us  to dec ide  fo r  anyg iven  sequence  of e lements  f rom a g iven  language whether  or  not  the  sequenceis grammatical.We consider only one method, named that of a categorial g rammar  (Bar-Hilleland Lambek).We make the fo l low ing  assumpt ions :(a) The  knowledge we want  to u t i l i ze  fo r  recogn i t ion  can  w i thout  res idue  besummar ized  ina l i s t ,  g iv ing  fo r  each  word  the grammat ica l  ca tegor ies  the wordbe longs  to;  a se t  of combinat ion  ru les  fo r  the  category  symbo ls .

We say  that  a symbo l  sequence  wh ich  agrees  w i th  the combinat ionru les  is  a grammat ica l  symbo l  sequence .Z.
Shr ink ing  ProcedureWe assume that  i t  i s  poss ib le  to ver i fy  the grammat ica l i ty  of a symbo l  sequenceby  reduct ion  of i t  to s imp ler  and  shor ter  sequences  s tep  by  s tep .
In each  s tepone or  more  symbols  in  the sequences  are  rep laced  by  one new symbol .The s t r ing  rep laced  by  one o ther  symbo l  w i l l  - to beg in  w i th  w i thout  l ingu is t i cin terpretat ion  - be ca l led  a syntagrn ;  the  rep lac ing  symbol  w i l l  be ca l led  thename of the  syntagm.The work  repor ted  in th i s  paper  has  been sponsored  by Humanis t i ska  fo rsk -n ingsr~det ,  Tekn iska  fo rskn ingsr~det  and  R iksbankens  Jub i leumsfond,  S tock -ho lm,  Sweden.By success ive  app l i ca t ion  of rewr i t ing  ru les ,  the  or ig ina l  sequence  is  shrunkto a no longer  reduc ib le  res idue j  wh ichmay be jus t  one symbol .
If th i s  re -s idue is  conta ined  in  a g iven  l i s t  of permiss ib le  sentence  pat terns ,  the sen-tence  is  g rammat ica l .3.
S lant  Grammar  Ca lcu lusThe  k ind  of g rammar  under  s tudy  we sha l l  s imp ly  ca l l  s lant  g rammar  f romi t s  sa l ient  t ra i t ,  the  notat ion .
I t  is  character i zed  by the fo l low ing  proper t ies :a) IThe category  symbo ls  a re  a l l  of the fo rma (atomic symbols)%or x /y~ (complex symbols)  \xjwhere  x and  y in  the i r  tu rn  have  the same fo rm ~atomic  or  complex)  as thecategor--y symbo ls .
We sha l l  ca l l  a_ and  x numerators  and  X a denominatorin  such  cases .b) Combinatorics is condensed to the followinga) a sym-bol sequence is a grammat ica l  syntagm Of type t if and only if itcan be reducedtot  by successive application of one of-the following t~ocancellation rules for contracting two neighbouring symbols of the -original or the so far reduced - sequence into one symbol:x /y  y~ xy y\x-* xwhere  x and  Z are  a tomic  or  complex  symbo ls .8) a grammat ica l  sentence  is a syntagm of a type  wh ich  be longs  to a shor t  1-7l i s t  of poss ib le  types  of pat terns ,  say  type  s .The categorial notation seems helpful in establishing a recognition calculus.Some programmable  algorithms will be discussed in this paper.I t  i s  eas i ly  seen  that  s lant  g rammars  of the  type d iscussed  are  equ iva lent  tocontext - f ree  phrase  s t ructure  grammars  (as fa r ,  i .e .
,  as  any  generat ivegrammar  can  be "equ iva lent"  to a recogn i t ion  grammar) .The  cance l la t ion  ru les  presuppose  that  i f  the symbo ls  a /b  and  b are  reducedto a0 there  must  not  s tand  anyth ing  between the  syntagms a /b  and  b - i .e .
,the~e must  be no  ho le  in the  syntagm a - a l though the symbols  a /b- -and b mayin the or ig ina l  sequence  s tand  w ide ly  apar t .A s lant  g rammar  fo r  one g iven  language may be  wr i t ten  in many d i f fe rent  ways .Thus  one may des ign  the grammar  so that  the  category  symbo ls  hav__~e at the  mostone ~denominator  and  even  so that  they  have  on ly  le f t  denominator  o r  on ly  r ightdenominator (Marcus).A natural way  to design the grammar  would be to let governed syntagms havesimple symbols (~ and the govern ingo- -~complex symbols  x/y, or inversely,so that the relation operator/operand would imply dependency relation.However,  the number  of alternative symbols for each word  will tend to increaseif such a priori rules should apply to the whole set of symbols.
Given the algo-r i thm for  recogn i t ion ,  one may ask  how the categor ia l  g rammar  shou ld  be de-s igned  so as to g ive the min imum number  of operat ions ,  e .g .
,  so as  to y ie ldon an average ,  the min imum number  of poss ib le  word- fo r -word  t rans la t ionsinto grammat ica l  symbo ls .4.
Reduct ion  P rocedureTo beg in  w i th ,  we sha l l  inve~stigate some procedures  fo r  ana lys i s  of a g iven  se -quence  of ca tegory  symbo ls .
Then ,  cf .

Subst i tu t ing  Complex  SymbolsWe make a pre l iminary  s imp l i f i ca t ion  of the prob lem by rep lac ing  every  com-p lex  denominator  in the sequence  by a new,  a rb i t ra ry  a tomic  symbo l .
S imul -taneous ly ,  we make cor respond ing  subst i tu t ions  of numerators :  if  we rep laceb /c  by  x as a denominator ,  we a l so  rep lace  b /c  by, x at some other  p lace ,  whereb /c  appears  as a numerator .Example :b/(c/a) c/a b\a/(b/c) d d\(b/c) = b/y y a/x d d\x.Now,  if  b /c  shou ld  happen to appear  in numerator  pos i t ion  more  o f ten  in theg iven sequence  than  it does  qua denominator ,  th is  rep lacement  can be per -fo rmed in more  than one way.
We then  do per fo rm it  in more  than one way~thus  generat ing  a number  of a l te rnat ive  symbo l  s t r ings  to be processed .
Throughth is  a r t i f i ce ,  we have sequences  where  a l l  denominators  a re  cer ta in  to be a toms,a fac t  wh ich  rad ica l ly  s imp l i f ies  the ana lys i s .
Ins tead  we have made the symbo lqe lec t ion  procedure  more  d i f f i cu l t .S ince  now al l  denominators  a re  a toms and s ince  {b \a ) /c  is  equ iva lent  o b / (a /c )and to b~a/c ,  the brackets  a re  now redundant  and can be omi t ted .The symbo ls ,  then  cons is t  of  a kerne l  a tom,  poss ib ly  ne ighboured  at one s ideor  both  by a slant__ and another  a tom,  in i ts  tu rn  poss ib ly  ne ighboured  by s lantp lus  a tom,  and so on, a11 s lants  to the le f t  of the kerne l  be ing  t i l ted  to the  le f tand those  to the r ight  t i l ted  in the oppos i te  d i rec t ion :r - -a,  a/c, b\a lc ,  g \ f \e \d \a lb lc  I .

.If one knows  wh ich  e lement  is  the kerne l .one  does  not  even  need the s lants  andwe can proceed to s imp l i fy  one s tep  fu r ther :a, ac,  bac ,  gfeda_bc .

(If the language has  no ru les  fo r  the re la t ive  o rder  of syntagms,  g rammat ica -l i ty  i s  rap id ly  teste_~l~Just  check  that  to each  denominator  a tom cor respondsone numerator  a tom of the same name,  leav ing  w i thout  a match  jus t  one numer -a t0r ,  wh ich  then  denotes  the type of the syntagm.
In th is  case  we are  permi t tedto t reat  the a toms as numerators  and denominators  in the ar i thmet ica l  sense .If we ass ign  pr ime numbers  to each  a tom and reduce  in the s tandard  ar i thme-t i ca l  way ,  we end  up w i th  the numer ica l  va lue  of the type of the syn~agm.
Th iss imp le  tes t  may be wor th  cons ider ing  as  a f i r s t  check ,  even  though the s t rUc -tu re  of the language be fa r  more  complex .

On  the string ofthese new symbols the above procedure, mutatis mutandis, is applied.
Thus,instead of the condition in (I) above that two atoms should be the "same"characters, it is required that one underlined atom A and a non-underlinedatom B appearing separated only by space should fulfill the condition A n B ~ 0.ReferencesI.
