It follows onfrom TempEval-1 and -2, with: a three-part struc-ture covering temporal expression, event, and tem-poral relation extraction; a larger dataset; and newsingle measures to rank systems ?
in each task and ingeneral.
In this paper, we describe the participants?approaches, results, and the observations from theresults, which may guide future research in this area.1 IntroductionThe TempEval task (Verhagen et al 2009) was added as anew task in SemEval-2007.
The ultimate aim of researchin this area is the automatic identification of temporal ex-pressions (timexes), events, and temporal relations withina text as specified in TimeML annotation (Pustejovsky etal., 2005).
However, since addressing this aim in a firstevaluation challenge was deemed too difficult a stagedapproach was suggested.TempEval (henceforth TempEval-1) was an initialevaluation exercise focusing only on the categorization oftemporal relations and only in English.
It included threerelation types: event-timex, event-dct,1 and relations be-tween main events in consecutive sentences.TempEval-2 (Verhagen et al 2010) extendedTempEval-1, growing into a multilingual task, and con-sisting of six subtasks rather than three.
This includedevent and timex extraction, as well as the three relationtasks from TempEval-1, with the addition of a relationtask where one event subordinates another.TempEval-3 (UzZaman et al 2012b) is a follow-upto TempEval 1 and 2, covering English and Spanish.TempEval-3 is different from its predecessors in a fewrespects:1DCT stands for document creation timeSize of the corpus: the dataset used has about 600Kword silver standard data and about 100K word gold stan-dard data for training, compared to around 50K word cor-pus used in TempEval 1 and 2.
Temporal annotation isa time-consuming task for humans, which has limitedthe size of annotated data in previous TempEval exer-cises.
Current systems, however, are performing close tothe inter-annotator reliability, which suggests that largercorpora could be built from automatically annotated datawith minor human reviews.
We want to explore whetherthere is value in adding a large automatically created sil-ver standard to a hand-crafted gold standard.End-to-end temporal relation processing task: thetemporal relation classification tasks are performed fromraw text, i.e.
participants need to extract their own eventsand temporal expressions first, determine which ones tolink and then obtain the relation types.
In previous Tem-pEvals, gold timexes, events, and relations (without cate-gory) were given to participants.Temporal relation types: the full set of temporal re-lations in TimeML are used, rather than the reduced setused in earlier TempEvals.Platinum test set: A new test dataset has been devel-oped for this edition.
It is based on manual annotationsby experts over new text (unseen in previous editions).Evaluation: we report a temporal awareness score forevaluating temporal relations, which helps to rank sys-tems with a single score.2 DataIn TempEval-3, we reviewed and corrected existing cor-pora, and also released new corpora.2.1 Reviewing Existing CorporaWe considered the existing TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al2003) and AQUAINT2 data for TempEval-3.

In TimeBank, we, (i) borrowed the events fromthe TempEval-2 corpus and (ii) borrowed the temporal re-lations from TimeBank corpus, which contains a full setof temporal relations.
In AQUAINT, we added the tem-poral relations between event and DCT (document cre-ation time), which was missing for many documents inthat corpus.
These existing corpora comprised the high-quality component of our training set.2.2 New CorporaWe created two new datasets: a small, manually-annotated set over new text (platinum); and a machine-annotated, automatically-merged dataset based on out-puts of multiple systems (silver).The TempEval-3 platinum evaluation corpus was anno-tated/reviewed by the organizers, who are experts in thearea.
This process used the TimeML Annotation Guide-lines v1.2.1 (Saur??
et al 2006).
Every file was anno-tated independently by at least two expert annotators, anda third was dedicated to adjudicating between annotationsand merging the final result.
Some annotators based theirwork on TIPSem annotation suggestions (Llorens et al2012b).
The GATE Annotation Diff tool was used formerging (Cunningham et al 2013), a custom TimeMLvalidator ensured integrity,3 and CAVaT (Derczynski andGaizauskas, 2010) was used to determine various modesof TimeML mis-annotation and inconsistency that are in-expressable via XML schema.
Post-exercise, that corpus(TempEval-3 Platinum with around 6K tokens, on com-pletely new text) is released for the community to review3See https://github.com/hllorens/TimeML-validatorand improve.4 Inter-annotator agreement (measured withF1, as per Hripcsak and Rothschild (2005)) and the num-ber of annotation passes per document were higher thanin existing TimeML corpora, hence the name.
Details aregiven in Table 1.
Attribute value scores are given basedon the agreed entity set.
These are for exact matches.The TempEval-3 silver evaluation corpus is a 600Kword corpus collected from Gigaword (Parker etal., 2011).
We automatically annotated this corpusby TIPSem, TIPSem-B (Llorens et al 2013) andTRIOS (UzZaman and Allen, 2010).
These systems wereretrained on the corrected TimeBank and AQUAINT cor-pus to generate the original TimeML temporal relationset.
We then merged these three state-of-the-art sys-tem outputs using our merging algorithm (Llorens et al2012a).
In our selected merged configuration all entitiesand relations suggested by the best system (TIPSem) areadded in the merged output.
Suggestions from other sys-tems (TRIOS and TIPSem-B) are added in the mergedoutput, only if they are also supported by another system.The weights considered in our configuration are: TIPSem0.36, TIPSemB 0.32, TRIOS 0.32.For Spanish, Spanish TimeBank 1.0 corpus (Saur??
andBadia, 2012) wads used.
It is the same corpus that wasused in TempEval-2, with a major review of entity anno-tation and an important improvement regarding temporalrelation annotation.
For TempEval-3, we converted ES-TimeBank link types to the TimeML standard types basedon Allen?s temporal relations (Allen, 1983).Table 2 summarizes our released corpora, measuredwith PTB-scheme tokens as words.
All data producedwas annotated using a well-defined subset of TimeML,designed for easy processing, and for reduced ambigu-ity compared to standard TimeML.
Participants were en-couraged to validate their submissions using a purpose-built tool to ensure that submitted runs were legible.
Wecalled this standard TimeML-strict, and release it sepa-rately (Derczynski et al 2013).3 TasksThe three main tasks proposed for TempEval-3 focus onTimeML entities and relations:3.1 Task A (Timex extraction and normalization)Determine the extent of the timexes in a text as definedby the TimeML TIMEX3 tag.
In addition, determine thevalue of the features TYPE and VALUE.
The possiblevalues of TYPE are time, date, duration, and set; VALUEis a normalized value as defined by the TIMEX3 standard.4In the ACL data and code repository, reference ADCR2013T001.See also https://bitbucket.org/leondz/te3-platinum23.2 Task B (Event extraction and classification)Determine the extent of the events in a text as defined bythe TimeML EVENT tag and the appropriate CLASS.3.3 Task ABC (Annotating temporal relations)This is the ultimate task for evaluating an end-to-end sys-tem that goes from raw text to TimeML annotation ofentities and links.
It entails performing tasks A and B.From raw text extract the temporal entities (events andtimexes), identify the pairs of temporal entities that havea temporal link (TLINK) and classify the temporal re-lation between them.
Possible pair of entities that canhave a temporal link are: (i) main events of consecu-tive sentences, (ii) pairs of events in the same sentence,(iii) event and timex in the same sentence and (iv) eventand document creation time.
In TempEval-3, TimeMLrelation are used, i.e.
: BEFORE, AFTER, INCLUDES, IS-INCLUDED, DURING, SIMULTANEOUS, IMMEDIATELYAFTER, IMMEDIATELY BEFORE, IDENTITY, BEGINS,ENDS, BEGUN-BY and ENDED-BY.In addition to this main tasks, we also include two extratemporal relation tasks:Task C (Annotating relations given gold entities)Given the gold entities, identify the pairs of entities thathave a temporal link (TLINK) and classify the temporalrelations between them.Task C relation only (Annotating relations given goldentities and related pairs) Given the temporal entitiesand the pair of entities that have a temporal link, classifythe temporal relation between them.4 Evaluation MetricsThe metrics used to evaluate the participants are:4.1 Temporal Entity ExtractionTo evaluate temporal entities (events and temporal ex-pressions), we need to evaluate, (i) How many entities arecorrectly identified, (ii) If the extents for the entities arecorrectly identified, and (iii) How many entity attributesare correctly identified.
We use classical precision andrecall for recognition.How many entities are correctly identified: We evalu-ate our entities using the entity-based evaluation with theequations below.Precision = |Sysentity?Refentity||Sysentity|Recall = |Sysentity?Refentity||Refentity|where, Sysentity contains the entities extracted by thesystem that we want to evaluate, and Refentity containsthe entities from the reference annotation that are beingcompared.If the extents for the entities are correctly identified:We compare our entities with both strict match and re-laxed match.
When there is a exact match between thesystem entity and gold entity then we call it strict match,e.g.
?sunday morning?
vs ?sunday morning?.
When thereis a overlap between the system entity and gold entitythen we call it relaxed match, e.g.
?sunday?
vs ?sundaymorning?.
When there is a relaxed match, we comparethe attribute values.How many entity attributes are correctly identified: Weevaluate our entity attributes using the attribute F1-score,which captures how well the system identified both theentity and attribute (attr) together.Attribute Recall =|{?x | x?
(Sysentity?Refentity)?Sysattr(x)==Refattr(x)}||Refentity|Attribute Precision =|{?x | x?
(Sysentity?Refentity)?Sysattr(x)==Refattr(x)}||Sysentity|Attribute F1-score = 2?p?rp+rAttribute (Attr) accuracy, precision and recall can becalculated as well from the above information.Attr Accuracy = Attr F1 / Entity Extraction F1Attr R = Attr Accuracy * Entity RAttr P = Attr Accuracy * Entity P4.2 Temporal Relation ProcessingTo evaluate relations, we use the evaluation metric pre-sented by UzZaman and Allen (2011).5 This metric cap-tures the temporal awareness of an annotation in termsof precision, recall and F1 score.
Temporal awarenessis defined as the performance of an annotation as identi-fying and categorizing temporal relations, which impliesthe correct recognition and classification of the tempo-ral entities involved in the relations.
Unlike TempEval-2 relation score, where only categorization is evaluatedfor relations, this metric evaluates how well pairs of enti-ties are identified, how well the relations are categorized,and how well the events and temporal expressions are ex-tracted.Precision =|Sys?relation?Ref+relation||Sys?relation|Recall =|Ref?relation?Sys+relation||Ref?relation|where, G+ is the closure of graph G and G?
is thereduced of graph G, where redundant relations are re-moved.6We calculate the Precision by checking the numberof reduced system relations (Sys?relation) that can be veri-fied from the reference annotation temporal closure graph(Ref+relation), out of number of temporal relations in the5We used a minor variation of the formula, where we consider thereduced graph instead of all system or reference relations.
Details canbe found in Chapter 6 of UzZaman (2012).6A relation is redundant if it can be inferred through other relations.3strict valueF1 P R F1 F1HeidelTime-t 90.30 93.08 87.68 81.34 77.61HeidelTime-bf 87.31 90.00 84.78 78.36 72.39HeidelTime-1.2 86.99 89.31 84.78 78.07 72.12NavyTime-1,2 90.32 89.36 91.30 79.57 70.97ManTIME-4 89.66 95.12 84.78 74.33 68.97ManTIME-6 87.55 98.20 78.99 73.09 68.27ManTIME-3 87.06 94.87 80.43 69.80 67.45SUTime 90.32 89.36 91.30 79.57 67.38ManTIME-1 87.20 97.32 78.99 70.40 67.20ManTIME-5 87.20 97.32 78.99 69.60 67.20ManTIME-2 88.10 97.37 80.43 72.22 66.67ATT-2 85.25 98.11 75.36 78.69 65.57ATT-1 85.60 99.05 75.36 79.01 65.02ClearTK-1,2 90.23 93.75 86.96 82.71 64.66JU-CSE 86.38 93.28 80.43 75.49 63.81KUL 83.67 92.92 76.09 69.32 62.95KUL-TE3RunABC 82.87 92.04 75.36 73.31 62.15ClearTK-3,4 87.94 94.96 81.88 77.04 61.48ATT-3 80.85 97.94 68.84 72.34 60.43FSS-TimEx 85.06 90.24 80.43 49.04 58.24TIPSem (TE2) 84.90 97.20 75.36 81.63 65.31Table 3: Task A - Temporal Expression Performance.reduced system relations (Sys?relation).
Similarly, wecalculate the Recall by checking the number of reducedreference annotation relations (Ref?relation) that can beverified from the system output?s temporal closure graph(Sys+relation), out of number of temporal relations in thereduced reference annotation (Ref?relation).This metric evaluates Task ABC together.
For Task Cand Task C - relation only, all the gold annotation entitieswere provided and then evaluated using the above metric.Our evaluation toolkit that evaluated TempEval-3 par-ticipants is available online.75 Evaluation ResultsThe aim of this evaluation is to provide a meaningful re-port of the performance obtained by the participants inthe tasks defined in Section 3.Furthermore, the results include TIPSem as referencefor comparison.
This was used as a pre-annotation systemin some cases.
TIPSem obtained the best results in eventprocessing task in TempEval-2 and offered very compet-itive results in timex and relation processing.
The besttimex processing system in TempEval-2 (HeidelTime) isparticipating in this edition as well, therefore we includedTIPSem as a reference in all tasks.We only report results in main measures.
Results aredivided by language and shown per task.

Details about participants?
approaches can befound in Table 4.We rank the participants for Task A on the F1 scoreof most important timex attribute ?
Value.
To get theattribute Value correct, a system needs to correctly nor-malise the temporal expression.
This score (Value F1)captures the performance of extracting the timex andidentifying the attribute Value together (Value F1 = TimexF1 * Value Accuracy).Participants approached the temporal expression ex-traction task with rule-engineered methods, machinelearning methods and also hybrid methods.
For temporalexpression normalization (identifying the timex attributevalue), all participants used rule-engineered approaches.Observations: We collected the following observa-tions from the results and from participants?
experiments.Strategy: Competition was close for timex recogni-tion and the best systems all performed within 1% ofeach other.
On our newswire corpus, statistical systems(ClearTK) performed best at strict matching, and rule-engineered system best at relaxed matching (NavyTime,SUTime, HeidelTime).Strategy: post-processing, on top of machine learning-base temporal expression extraction, provided a statisti-cally significant improvement in both precision and recall(ManTIME).Data: using the large silver dataset, alone or togetherwith human annotated data, did not give improvements inperformance for Task A. Human-annotated gold standarddata alone provided the best performance (ManTIME).Data: TimeBank alone was better than TimeBank andAQUAINT together for Task A (ClearTK).Features: syntactic and gazetteers did not provide anystatistically significant increment of performance with re-spect to the morphological features alone (ManTIME).Regarding the two sub-tasks of timex annotation,recognition and interpretation/normalisation, we noticeda shift in the state of the art.
While normalisation iscurrently (and perhaps inherently) done best by rule-engineered systems, recognition is now done well by avariety of methods.
Where formerly, rule-engineeredtimex recognition always outperformed other classes ofapproach, now it is clear that rule-engineering and ma-chine learning are equally good at timex recognition.5.1.2 Task B: EventsFor event extraction (Task B) we had seven participantsand 10 unique runs.

Additionally, TimeBank and AQUAINTtogether performed better than just TimeBank alone(NavyTime-1, ClearTK-3,4).Linguistic Features: Semantic features (ls and ss) haveplayed an important role, since the best systems (TIPSem,ATT1 and KUL) include them.

In the interest of rigour and fairness, weseparate out this system.For task C, for provided participants with entities andparticipants identified: between which entity pairs a rela-tion exists (link identification); and the class of that rela-tion.
Results are given in Table 8.
We also evaluate theparticipants on the relation by providing the entities andthe links (performance in Table 9) ?
TIPSem could not beevaluated in this setting since the system is not preparedto do categorization only unless the relations are dividedas in TempEval-2.
For these Task C related tasks, we hadonly one new participant, who didn?t participate in TaskA and B: UTTime.Identifying which pair of entities to consider for tem-poral relations is a new task in this TempEval challenge.The participants approached the problems in data-driven,rule-based and also in hybrid ways (Table 1010).

Most of the systems usethe combined TimeBank and AQUAINT (TBAQ) corpus.Data: Adding additional high-quality relations, eitherPhilippe Muller?s closure-based inferences or the verbclause relations from Bethard et al(2007), typically in-creased recall and the overall performance (ClearTK runstwo and four).Features: Participants mostly used the morphosyntac-tic and lexical semantic information.
The best perform-ing systems from TempEval-2 (TIPSem and TRIOS) ad-ditionally used sentence level semantic information.
Oneparticipant in TempEval-3 (UTTime) also did deep pars-ing for the sentence level semantic features.Features: Using more Linguistic knowledge is impor-tant for the task, but it is more important to execute itproperly.
Many systems performed better using less lin-guistic knowledge.
Hence a system (e.g.
ClearTK) withbasic morphosyntactic features is hard to beat with moresemantic features, if not used properly.entity extractionstrict relaxedF1 F1 P R valueHeidelTime 85.3 90.1 96.0 84.9 87.5TIPSemB-F 82.6 87.4 93.7 81.9 82.0FSS-TimEx 49.5 65.2 86.6 52.3 62.7Table 12: Task A: Temporal Expression (Spanish).class tense aspectF1 P R F1 F1 F1FSS-TimEx 57.6 89.8 42.4 24.9 - -TIPSemB-F 88.8 91.7 86.0 57.6 41.0 36.3Table 13: Task B: Event Extraction (Spanish).Classifier: Across the various tasks, ClearTK triedMallet CRF, Mallet MaxEnt, OpenNLP MaxEnt, and LI-BLINEAR (SVMs and logistic regression).
They pickedthe final classifiers by running a grid search over modelsand parameters on the training data, and for all tasks, aLIBLINEAR model was at least as good as all the othermodels.
As an added bonus, it was way faster to trainthan most of the other models.6 Evaluation Results (Spanish)There were two participants for Spanish.
Both partici-pated in task A and only one of them in task B.

TIPSemB-Freeling is theSpanish version of TIPSem with the main difference thatit does not include semantic roles.
Furthermore, it usesFreeling (Padro?
and Stanilovsky, 2012) to obtain the lin-guistic features automatically.Table 12 shows the results obtained for task A.
As itcan be observed HeidelTime obtains the best results.
Itimproves the previous state-of-the-art results (TIPSemB-F), especially in normalization (value F1).Table 13 shows the results from event extraction.
Inthis case, the previous state-of-the-art is not improved.Table 14 only shows the results obtained in temporalawareness by the state-of-the-art system since there werenot participants on this task.
We observe that TIPSemB-Fapproach offers competitive results, which is comparableto results obtained in TE3 English test set.6.1 Comparison with TempEval-2TempEval-2 Spanish test set is included as a subset of thisTempEval-3 test set.
We can therefore compare the per-formance across editions.
Furthermore, we can includethe full-featured TIPSem (Llorens et al 2010), whichunlike TIPSemB-F used the AnCora (Taule?
et al 2008)corpus annotations as features including semantic roles.For timexes, as can be seen in Table 15, the origi-nal TIPSem obtains better results for timex extraction,which favours the hypothesis that machine learning sys-tems are very well suited for this task (if the training datais sufficiently representative).
However, for normaliza-tion (value F1), HeidelTime ?
a rule-engineered system ?obtains better results.
This indicates that rule-based ap-proaches have the upper hand in this task.

TIPSemB-F and TIPSem obtained a similar per-formance.
TIPSemB-F performed better in extraction andTIPSem better in attribute classification.7 ConclusionIn this paper, we described the TempEval-3 task withinthe SemEval 2013 exercise.
This task involves identify-ing temporal expressions (timexes), events and their tem-poral relations in text.
In particular participating systemswere required to automatically annotate raw text usingTimeML annotation schemeThis is the first time end-to-end systems are evalu-ated with a new single score (temporal awareness).
InTempEval-3 participants had to obtain temporal relationsfrom their own extracted timexes and events which is avery challenging task and was the ultimate evaluation aimof TempEval.
It was proposed at TempEval-1 but has notbeen carried out until this edition.The newly-introduced silver data proved not so usefulfor timex extraction or relation classification, but did helpwith event extraction.
The new single-measure helped torank systems easily.Future work could investigate temporal annotation inspecific applications.
Current annotations metrics evalu-ate relations for entities in the same consecutive sentence.For document-level understanding we need to understanddiscourse and pragmatic information.
Temporal questionanswering-based evaluation (UzZaman et al 2012a) canhelp us to evaluate participants on document level tempo-ral information understanding without creating any addi-tional training data.
Also, summarisation, machine trans-lation, and information retrieval need temporal annota-tion.
Application-oriented challenges could further re-search in these areas.From a TimeML point of view, we still haven?t tack-led subordinate relations (TimeML SLINKs), aspectualrelations (TimeML ALINKs), or temporal signal anno-tation (Derczynski and Gaizauskas, 2011).
The criticalquestions of which links to annotate, and whether the cur-rent set of temporal relation types are appropriate for lin-guistic annotation, are still unanswered.AcknowledgmentsWe thank the participants ?
