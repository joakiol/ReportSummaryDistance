However, when the con-tent is complicated and the sentence islong, people want to know at an earlierstage in the sentence whether the contentis negative, affirmative, or interrogative.In Japanese, the grammatical form calledthe KO-OU relation exists.
The KO-OUrelation is a kind of concord.
If a KO ele-ment appears, then an OU element ap-pears in the latter part of a sentence.
It isbeing pointed out that the KO-OU relationgives advance notice to the element thatappears in the latter part of a sentence.
Inthis paper, we present the method of ex-tracting automatically the KO-OU expres-sion data from large-scale electroniccorpus and verify the usefulness of theKO-OU expression data.1 IntroductionThe Japanese language has a grammatical formcalled the KO-OU relation.
The KO-OU relation isa kind of concord, also referring to a sort of boundrelation that a KO element appearing in a sentenceis followed by an OU element in the latter part ofthe same sentence.
On the contrary, the cooccur-rence relation refers to two words appearing in thesame sentence.Because Japanese predicates are usually locatedat the end of sentences, the contents of Japanesesentences cannot be decided until reaching the end.Furthermore, in Japanese, it is hard to comprehendthe meaning of the sentence without readingthrough the entire sentence.
The KO-OU relation isthe grammatical form which can be helpful for un-derstanding the sentence meaning at the early stage.While in archaic Japanese, KAKARI-MUSUBI,which had morphemic KO-OU relation betweenKAKARI-JOSI1 and the conjugation at the end of asentence, had been used.
KAKARI-MUSUBI gaveadvance notice to the elements that would appeartoward the end of a sentence due to KAKARI-JOSI.Today, KAKARI-MUSUBI has dropped out of use.However, the KO-OU relation such as "sika-nai(only)" or "kessite-nai (never)" is present.
In thisresearch, we have attempted to collect such ele-ments to extract KO-OU expression data.
In thispaper, the main points of argument are as follows:(1) Method of extracting automatically the KO-OUexpression data.
(2) What the KO-OU expression data can be usedfor.2 The Previous Works and How to Posi-tion this Study(Ohno, 1993) pointed out that there were expres-sions that try to give advance notice to whether asentence is affirmative, negative, or interrogative atthe early stage of a language expression whichcontinues timewise.
It suggested that there werecertain adverbs that have replaced KAKARI-JOSIin the archaic Japanese words.
(Masuoka, 1991) described the KO-OU relationof sentence elements.
According to Masuoka, somesentences have the KO-OU expressions as shownin Table 1.However, this has the following weaknesses.The KO and OU elements in a KO-OU relation areplaced together in the same category, and there is1 A Japanese particle.no description as to the OU element.
Furthermore,only a limited number of elements are listed.
Andthe objectivity of the KO and OU elements is notguaranteed.The KO-OU expression data is useful as basicdata to dissolve ambiguity in parsing and to decideon the modification relation.
However, first of all,it is necessary for the data to have a certain lengthfor being useful basic data.
Secondly, it also needsto be objective.
Therefore, we have attempted toextract KO-OU relations automatically from large-scale corpus.Table 1 Masuoka?s KO-OU expression data3 Assumed Usage of KO-OU ExpressionData3.1 To Dissolve AmbiguityThe KO-OU expression data is useful for dissolv-ing ambiguity of parsing.
Furthermore, it is usefulfor deciding the modification relation (Figure 1).3.2 Gradual UnderstandingUsing the KO-OU expression data will enable thereader to guess the end expression midway througha sentence.
This is because as the KO elementsappear it is possible to predict the appearance ofthe OU elements (Figure 2).
It can be used as abasic data for understanding sentences.
In addition,this technology can be used to guess the point inthe minutes of a meeting at which the speakerschange.Figure 1 To Dissolve AmbiguityFigure 2 Gradual UnderstandingKO element OU elementNee,  oi te-kudasai,  naatabun,  doumo daro-u,  rasii,  you-dakessite,  kanarazu-si-mo naiconviction(If you chew it, you will certainly taste salmon.)?????????????

conviction ?KO-OU relation data (image)4 Extraction of KO-OU Expression Data4.1 Method(Yamamoto and Umemura, 2002) considered theestimation of the one-to-many relation betweenentities in corpus.
They carried out experimentson extracting one-to-many relation of phenomenafrom corpus using complementary similaritymeasure (CSM) which can cope very well withinclusion relation of appearance patterns.
The KO-OU relation in this research can be regarded as atype of one-to-many relation.4.2 Data UsedIn this paper, we dealt with what is called FUKU-JOSI2, KAKARI-JOSI, and some adverbs shownbelow.
We proceeded on the assumption that theseare the KO elements in the KO-OU relation.
Forour research, we used newspaper articles from theMainichi Shimbun, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, andYomiuri Shimbun issued between 1991 and 2000.
[Target words]koso, sika, sae, ha, mo, bakari, nomi, sura, nara,kurai, dake, nannte, kessite, osoraku, tabun, zehi,marude, mosi, kittoFigure 3 Process flow4.3 Process FlowProcess flow is shown in Figure 3.
(1) We calculated the similarity measure usingCSM for newspaper articles data that had beenmorphologically analyzed with ChaSen3.
(2) We extracted pairs containing the target wordsfrom the results of similarity measure calculation.2 A Japanese particle.3 Morphological Analyzer ChaSen.
See http://chasen.aist-nara.ac.jp/.
(3) Out of the pairs in (2), we extracted words thatappeared in the order of KO and OU elements.
(We judge the pairs based on this word order.
)(4) We carried out judgment based on reliability.As a result of this process, we obtained 14 pairsof data which had "kesshite" as KO element, 16which had "sae," and 23 which had "wa."
Data ofapproximately 20 pairs was obtained per targetword.5 Verification of KO-OU ExpressionData5.1 Necessity to Give Meaning/InformationIf the KO-OU expression data is used for gradualunderstanding of sentences, it was necessary forthe data to be given meaning/information.
Whenthe KO element appears, it will be possible to suf-ficiently grasp or guess the contents of a sentenceby referring the KO-OU expression data (Figure2).However it is difficult to give mean-ing/information using the data obtained from theprocess in Chapter 4 because the data is brokendown into each morpheme by the morphologicalanalysis, and each element is too short.In Japanese sentences, there are many cases inwhich continuation of a particle and an auxiliaryverb builds a predicate.
This continuation plays animportant role in determining the event of the sen-tence.
Particles and auxiliary verbs are functionalwords.
Therefore, it is not possible to determinethe meaning of some of the particles and auxiliaryverbs when they appeared independently.
Fur-thermore, there are some cases in which theychange their meaning when paired with anotherword.Table 2 shows the OU elements obtained pursu-ant to the procedure in Chapter 4 for KO element"kitto".
"Da" listed in Table 2 has an assertivemeaning when used in a sentence like "kyou waame da .
(It is raining today.)"
On the other hand, ithas an inferential meaning in the context of "asuwa hareru daro-u .
(It should be fine tomorrow.)"
Inaddition, although "nai" is a negative auxiliaryverb, when it is paired as in "ka-mo-shire-nai (maybe)" and "chigai-nai (must be)," the negative mean-ing disappears.
And the overall pairing stands forguess and conviction.morphologicallyanalyzed data(1) Calculate similarityKO-OU expression data(2) Extract pairs(3) Judgment based on word(4) Judgment based on reliability.Table 2  KO-OU expression dataKO element OU element KO element OU elementKitto u (auxiliary) kitto yo (particle)kitto da (auxiliary) kitto chigai (noun)kitto to (particle) kitto ka (particle)kitto omou (verb) kitto Ne (particle)kitto nai (auxiliary) kitto you (noun)kitto hazu (noun) : :5.2 Verification of OU Element Using"Kitto"In this section, we carry out an analytical exampleusing OU element for KO element "kitto (cer-tainly)."
We can classify the OU elements obtainedfrom the procedure in Chapter 4, as follows:(a) It can be an OU element by itself,(b) It can become an OU element when pairedwith others,(c) It does not have the possibility of becoming anOU element.Words of (c) were not found in the OU ele-ments obtained for KO element "kitto."
In the fol-lowing, we will describe the details on (a) and (b).
(a) OU element by itselfOut of the OU elements for KO element "kitto" inTable 2, "hazu" can be an OU element by itself.
[1] koudaina umibe de miru sakuhin wa kitto miryokutekini utsuru hazu da .
(Works that you see at the open seaside should look attractive.
)This is the only sentence with an independentOU element for "kitto" in the data obtained fromthe process in Chapter 4.
The same can be said ofdata for KO elements other than "kitto."
Becauseof morphological analysis, the row of letters hasbeen shortened.
As a result, there are few ele-ments that can be regarded as an OU element byitself.
And just looking at this element does notdetermine the meaning.
(b) OU element when paired with othersWhen "chigai" is paired with "ni" and "nai" tomake "ni-chigai-nai (must be)," it becomes an OUelement.
Similarly, pairing "da" with "u" results inan OU element "daro-u (perhaps)."
"Da" is theoriginal form of "daro" and becomes "daro-u"when paired with "u.
"[2] kitto kintyou suru daro-u .
(It is certain that one will be nervous.
)[3] kamisimereba , kitto sake no aji ga suru ni-chiga-inai .
(If you chew it, you will certainly taste salmon.
)If we look over the entire pairing shown above,we can give meaning to such guess and conviction.6 Questions for the FutureAs we described in Chapter 5, it is necessary topair multiple elements before giving mean-ing/information.
We currently persuade the issueof automatic generation of pairing multiple ele-ments.
Now, we are carrying out experiments oncalculating the similarity measure of pairing ofelements.
These will give us pairing of automati-cally generated elements and the similarity meas-ure of the pairings.
This should be useful data forresolving ambiguity (Figure 1).7 ConclusionThis paper presented the process of extractingKO-OU expression data using CSM and the use-fulness of the extracted KO-OU expression data.We are planning to report on the findings of ex-periments on automatic generation of OU ele-ments pairings.Acknowledgments To compile this paper, we usednewspaper articles from The Mainichi Newspapers,The Yomiuri Shimbun, and Nihon Keizai Shimbun.We would like to sincerely thank Dr. M.
