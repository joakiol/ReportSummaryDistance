KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION FROM TEXTS BY SINTESIABSTRACTIn this paper we present SINTESI, a system forthe knowledge extraction from Italian inputs,currently under development in our re,searchcentre.
It is used on short descriptive diagnostictexts, in order to summarise their technicalcontent and to build a knowledge base on faults.Often in these texts complex linguisticconstructions like conjunctions, negations, ellipsisand anaphorae are involved.
The presence ofextragrammaticalities andof implicit knowledge isalso frequent, especially because of the use of asublanguage.
SINTESI extracts the diagnosticinformation by performing a full text analysis; itis based on a semantics driven approach integratedby a general syntactic module and it is able tocope with the complexity of the (sub)language,maintaining both accuracy and robustness.Currently the system has been tested on about1.000 texts and by a few users; in the near futureit will be used by dozens of users every day.1.
INTRODUCTIONIn the last years a great interest in the informationretrieval from texts has grown; as a matter of factthe more the ability of memorising large quantitiesof data increases, the more the difficulties inextracting grows.
The classical informationretrieval approaches that consider the input onlyfrom a formal point of view are not powerful oruser-friendly enough, as they are not able to copewith the real content of the texts; the quality oftheir results is generally poor.
When a higherquality is needed, it is necessary to adopt methodsderived from the field of the natural languageprocessing, to extract some structured knowledge(as the objects mentioned and their relations).
Inthis case different kinds of applications requiredifferent architectures.
As a matter of fact, tuextract information from news it is necessary to beable to cover a wide range of correct syntacticforms, but a little of extragrammaticalities.
At thesame time the general knowledge sources aremore important than the domain dependent\[Jacobs 88\].
On the contrary, in the case of shorttechnical texts (tot example diagnostic reports) a1 Grantee ATA; current address corso Croce 7, Torino.2 Grantee ATA; current address via Prospero 47,Grugliasco (To).Fabio CIRAVEGNAPaolo CAMPIA tAlberto COLOGNESE 2CENTRO RICERCHE FIATstrada Torino 50,Orbassano (To),Italywide syntactic overage is not the main needing,but a large use of extragrammaticalities or asublanguage must be taken into account \[Liddy91\].
At the same time the domain dependentknowledge sources assume a main role, especiallybecause of the presence of the implicit knowledge.In the latter case many of the approaches proposedin the field of NLP are not suitable or powerfulenough, as they should guarantee three mainfeatures: efficiency, robustness and accuracy.Efficienc3~ is necessary because the input isgenerally long (more than one sentence), requiringa strong treatment of phenomena such as anaphoraand ellipsis.
Moreover, the efficiency is importantwhen a system must operate in real time._Rgbustness is needed because of the use of asublanguage, the presence of implicit knowledgeand/or of ill-formed sentences.is needed because the objects involvedin a technical description are generally verycomplex from a linguistical point of view (forexample a car part name may be composed byeven ten words), and these descriptions aregenerally affected by the problems of thesublanguage and of the implicit knowledge.Accuracy allows to resolve those problems byusing not only the knowledge of the world, butthe lingqtistic information, too.Accuracy and robustness are difficult to obtain atthe same time; many classical approaches tonatural language processing guarantee accuracybut fail in robustness; other methods are robust,but not accurate.
The following techniques havebeen proposed in the last years to cope with theill-fbrmedness \[Kirtner 91\]:l.The addition of some special rules to aformal grammar \[Weischedel 83\];2.The introduction of some grammar-independent syntax-driven \[Mellish 89\] orsemantics driven rules \[Kirtner 91\].3.The treatment of the ill-fbrmedness as acorrect form of a sublanguage \[Lehrberger 86\].4.The Use of semantics driven approaches ascaseframe parsing \[Carbonell 84\].In this paper we present our experience inbuilding a system to extract knowledge from shorttechnical diagnostic texts; we adopted a full-textsemantics driven analysis integrated by the use ofa general syntactic parser.

OVERVIEW OF SINTESISINTESI (Sistema INtegrato per TESti in ltaliano)ICiravegna 89-921 is a prototype Ior theknowledge extraction from Italian inputs,perlorming a fidl-text analysis.
It is used on shortdescriptive technical texts (four or five sentencesin seven or eight lines) containing complexlinguistic constructions like conjunctions,negations, ellipsis and anaphorae.
The use ofextragrammatical language and of implicitknowledge is also frequent.
Typical of our domain(car fault reports) are the complex objectdescriptions (a full car part description mayinvolve the use of even ten words).
The goal ofSINTESI is to extract the diagnostic information(main fault, chain of c,'tuses, chain of effects, carparts involved, etc.)
from each text and v,) buildits semantic representation.
I  the rest of the paperwe will show how the different knowledge sourcescontribute to the text analysis and how theycontribute to guarantee the robustness, theefficiency and the accuracy.3 THE SENTENCE ANALYSISS1NTESI integrates five knowledge sources:lexical, syntactic, pragmatic, general semantic andworld knowledge.
The inlmt texts is first pre-processed by a morphological analyser with thehelp of a dictionary (cnrrently containing about4.000 entries).
A lexical-semantic analysis is thenapplied to recognise some special patterns uch asranges of data or numbers, measurements,chemical formulas, etc, through a context freegrammar.
Some special preliminary information("the semantic markers") is also lint in thesentence to help semantics in the following steps.The rest of the analysis is based on a semanticsdriven approach that integrates in a flexible waytwo modules dedicated to the linguistic, two to thesemantic and one to the pragmatic analysis (fig.
1).The semantic modules lead the analysis in order topertbrm two main steps: object recognition andobject linking.
This separation is introduced inorder to be able to recognize fragments, when acomplete analysis is impossible.
The syntacticmodules are used to build the linguistic structureof the objects and of the whole sentence.
Thepragmatics is mainly used to control the objectlinking.
Additional modules provide the discourseanalysis and the correlation of the knowledgeextracted in the different sentences of the text.q~e pragmatics and the additional modules are notdiscussed in this paper.3 The formalism was developed in collaboration witha group of the University of Torino.3.1 OBJECT RECOGNITIONThe object recognition step processes the textfrom left to right trying to identify the objects ineach sentence.
It is a bottom-up task that uses fourkind of knowledge: the semantic markers, thegeneral semantic knowledge, the world knowledgeand the syntactic knowledge.
The schema of thisstep is shown in fig.2.
The presence of the objectsis shown by the ?
m nti '  m ' rk  rL put by thelexicon.
The markers activate an expectation inthe semantic module that is used to control theanalysis and guarantee the robustness.
Thesyntactic module is then activated to recognise thestructural form of each object without trying tobuild a full sentence representation.
Theknow _~_~9~_gg \[Campia et al90\] is represented by anindependent grammar.
The syntactic structure ofthe linguistic expressions is represented bydependency trees.
This kind of representation waschosen because it makes the syntax-semanticsinteraction easier, tire interdependencies amongwords being shown in a very clear ntanner.
Thesyntactic analysis is done by a set of productionrules in which the conditions test the current reestatus, whereas the actions modify it.
A semantictest is performed immediately after each syntacticaction in order to ilnprove the efficiency andreduce the use of the backtracking \[Ciravegna91al.
Each semantic test activates tile semanticmodule which uses two kinds of knowledge toanswer to the test and to build the semanticrepresentation of the current object: the generalanti the world knowledge.The t~eneral semantic knnwled~,e is based oncaseframes and contains the basic intormation toanswer to the question (general description ofobjects, intormation about roles and role-fillers,etc.).
The caseframe model was derived from theEntity Oriented Parsing approach \[Hayes 84\].
Theinformation contained in the caseframes producesa first hint on the identity of the object.Performing a semantic test at this level meansfilling a role in a casefranre, The precise identityof all the already known objects is contained inthe w_A~rld knnwled~e and it is lormed by thesyntactic and semantic descriptions of each object\[Lesmo 90,91\]3.Only the objects interesting totthe knowledge extraction are containexl in thisstructure.
Pertbrming a semantic test at this levelmeans matching the syntactic repre~sentation o thecontained escriptions via a set of structural rules.Every accepted connection between two wordscontributes in filling both the roles of thecaseframe and to extract a semantic identity.
Thesyntactic analysis of the current object descriptionends when the next word is not belonging to thecurrent object description (for semantic, pragmaticor linguistic reasons).
The object is then closedand the contrul is returned to the semanticAcrEs DE COLING-92.

1992controller that will try to identify another object,until the end of the sentence is found.As examole of the analysis of a very easydescription of a ear fault, consider: "Fissaggi dellacoppa \[dell'\[ olio \[dell motore con cricche"(literally: "Bolts of the slump \[of the\] oil \[of the\]engine with breaks').
The first semantic marker isput on "fissaggi" that activates an entity of type"car_part" (fig.
3a).
At this step the role-expectation given by the caseframe shows that inthe rest of the sentence we will probably havesome other words specifying the current objectand a fault associated to the car part.
Theexpectation given by the world knowledge isgiven by the following car part descriptions:a.
(fissaggio (perno (baneo (motore))))b.
(fissaggio (coppa (olin (motore))))c. (fissaggio (coppa (riciclaggio (olio))))d. (fissaggio (ammortizzatori (anteriori (telaio))))These descriptions are transformed in thecorresponding dependency trees (see fig.3).
Thesyntactic module is then activated and it tries toconnect "coppa" to "fissaggio" through thepreposition "del"; the connection is semanticallyacceptable because there is a caseframeplausibility, and the preposition is acceptable forthe connection.
Moreover there are domain basedsemantic descriptions that support he connection('b' and 'c' only, because the others don'tsupport the word "coppa"), so the semanticmodule is able to continue the current objectbuilding and the parser does the same.
Theanalysis continues in the same way until the word"cricche" is found; "cricche" is pointing toanother kind of entity (a fault), so the semanticcontroller stops the syntactic module.
The faultdescription is then analysed in the same way.
Atthe end of the object recognition we will have twoobjects: a car part (given by a caseframe and the'b' description) and a thult.SINTESI is able to cope with the loss of thedeterminers and prepositions in the description,because the dependency grammar shows only thestructural relations between the different syntactictypes; for example a typical rule shows that adeterminer (or a noun) may be attached to a nounand not something like: "NP-> det+Noun".
Thiskind of ill-formedness are then overcome by theformalism, without introducing metarules,sublanguage concepts or semantics driven rules.At this level the interaction between syntax andsemantics brings to the object recognition from astructural and semantic point of view when theobject is present in the world knowledge base.When this identity is not known, it is possible torecognize the presence of the object by using onlythe syntactic module and the caseframe level ofthe knowledge base (role expectation).
Even if itis not possible to derive a direct identity (forstructural reasons), it is possible to recognize it byusing the role-expectation coming from the otherobjects in the sentence.
In this way, it is possibleto maintain the accuracy on the identity and on thestructure of the objects (if the description isalready known), maintaining the robustness (whenit is not known or it contains unknown words orunsolvable gaps).Note that even if the object recognition issemantics driven, the approach is flexible:sometimes in fact it becomes yntax-driven; ithappens to treat some special cases as the noun+adjectives+ noun construction due to the loss ofthe preposition between the two nouns.
Theseforms often give origin to nominal compounds,and, especially in conjunctions, bring to gardenpaths and different rules for the adjectives\[Campia et al90\].3.2 OBJECT LINKINGWhen all the objects of a sentence are identifiedby the object recognition step, a connectionamong them is tried, using the role-expectationcontained in the caseframe level.
There are twopossible kinds of connection strategies: totallinking and partial linking.
The first one is triedwhen no failures were reported uring the objectrecognition.
It integrates Bottom-Up (BUS) andTop-Down (TDS) strategies in order to build thestructure of the whole sentence.
The TDS is anexpectation-driven a alysis of the connectionsamong objects, driven by the main roles of somekinds of constituents (verbs, conjunctions, etc.).
Itis also driven by linguistic and pragmatic rules.The TDS is not executed in a left-to-right way andit is able to cope with some kinds of garden pathsinvolved by conjunctions.
The B__U__S.
is performedinstead from left to right, and connects the objectsnot considered by the TDS.
For every object arole-driven connection is tried with all the objectsthat are linguistically and semantically acceptable.A focus stack is used to control the connections.A score is given to every linking.
This score isintegrated by other evaluations coming from thedomain specific knowledge.
Different strategieson the connections are adopted according todifferent cases: it is possible that sometimes evensome linguistically non acceptable relations maybe accepted for pragmatical reasons.When the object recognition analysis reportedsome problems, only the BUS is adopted in orderto form some aggregates of objects.
Thisaggregation is influenced by the content of theunknown or incorrect parts of the input.Connections among objects separated by obscureparts are considered unlikely.
A classification ofthe unknown parts is done trying to apply somelexical, syntactic or semantic heuristic rules on theidentity of the words contained (a main verb has astrong power of separation, a group of adjectiveshasn't it, and so on).In the example of section 3.1, the two objects (thecar part and the fault) are linked via the slotACrF.S DI~ COL1NG-92.

1992"with fault" of the first object.
The connection isdone by the BUS strategy because the lack of averb in the sentence makes the system tohypothesize some gaps or ellipsis.
The result oftile analysis is shown in fig 3b.The separation between object recognitimt andobject linking guarantees the accuracy (whenpossible) and the robustness, by adopting differentstrategies according to the reliability rate of theobject recognition.
Note that even the TDS+BUSallows to cope with sentences that don't bring to actnnplete structure (i.e.
it is not possible toconnect some objects to any role in the sentence).It is possible because the BUS is always appliedand it is this strategy that guarantees dierobustness during the object linking.4.
ADVANTAGES OF THE SCHEMAThe illustrated strategy fits our requirements ofaccuracy, robustness and accuracy.Accuracy is achieved because the syntax-semantics interaction during the object recognitionand the TDS+BUS (during the object linking)bring to a lull sentence structural and semanticdefinition when the input is correct.Robustness is achieved during the objectrecognition because the syntactic analyser is ableto cope with some kinds of ill-formed input (theloss of prepositions and determiners), withoutintroducing extra-rules.
In any case the analysis isstill lead by semantics, so it is possible to forcethe syntactic module to accept an incorrect input.Moreover the semantic previsional ability ntakesus to cope with even unknown or incorrect objectdescriptions.
It is possible by excluding die worldknowledge and remaining at the caseti'alne l vel.The role-expectation driven analysis allows todetect the new descriptions attd to propose theiraddition to the knowledge base.
*The robustness i also achieved uring the objectlinking, because it is possible to adopt differentstrategies to cope with different rate ofunderstanding or ill-forlnedness (unknown parts ofthe input, the lack of some fundamentalconstituents a  the verbs, etc.
).is guarantied because at the objectrecognition level each syntactic connection isimmediately semantically tested, so the interactionis efficient.
Moreover the tests at the worldknowledge level are efficient, because they arereduced to a comparison between graphs (thecurrent syntactic tree and the possible deepdescriptious); it is particularly important in thereduction of the gaps involved by conjunctionsICiravegna 9lb\].In addition the separation between objectrecognition and object linking allows to insertbetween them an additional module calledSKIMMER that improves the efficiency; it is afunction that, given the interesting types of objectsfur the knowledge extraction (faults, car parts,etc.)
and the types of the ol3ject contained in thecurrent sentence, decides if die sentence will bringnew interesting information or not.
If not theobject linking and knowledge extraction areskipped.
It is necessary to apply the skimmer afterthe end of the object linking (and not before)because a negation or a semantic modifier maychange the meaning of an object.
Moreover theanafora resolution is not affected by the skippingof a sentence, because the objects are "alreadyrecognised.5.
CONCLUSIONSThis paper presents a system to extract knowledgefrom domain-oriented ill-formed Italian inputs.The tmrpose of the paper was to demonstrate howit is able to guarantee fficiency, robustness andaccuracy.
SINTESI is currently used to extractknowledge fronl technical diagnostic texts on carfaults.
From a linguistic point of view it is able toextract knowledge from sentences involving theuse of noun phrases, verb phrases andprepositional phrases; the sentences may containconjunctions, a limited set of garden paths andsome kinds of subordinates.
The system has twoways to operate: an on-line mode in which eachnew text is analysed in real time and the extractedknowledge is approved or refused by the user; anoft-line mode to process the 40.000 texts that arealready in a database.
The extracted knowledge isused to generate search keys for the database, forstatistical matters anti to build a knowledge baseon faults.
One of the goal of the system is thetransportability through the applications in thesame domain.
Currently SINTESI has been testedon about 1000 technical texts; the rate of thecorrectly extracted int~ormation was of about85%.
Many problems came from not currentlysupported forms, unknown objects or words, anticomplex garden paths.
The system is able toprocess about 150 texts per hour running on aVAX 6510.
It was developed by using theNexpert Object tool and the C-language; it is nowrunning in a DEC-VMS environment.In the near future we will extend SINTESI inorder to cover most of the linguistic ff)rms that arestill not covered.
A method to extensively copewith the implicit knowledge is under development.Until now the system has been tested by fewusers, but it will be utilised by dozens of peoplewith a rate of about 5.000 texts per year.6.
