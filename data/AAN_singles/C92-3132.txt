SURFACE AND DEEP CASESJARMILA PANEVOVAInstitute of Formal and Applied LinguisticsCharles UniversityPrague, CzechoslovakiaHANA SKoUMALOVAInstitute of Theoretical and Computational LinguisticsCharles UniversityPrague, CzechoslovakiaAbstractIn this paper we show therelation between the "surface(morphological) cases" and "deepcases" (participants), and thepossible way to  automate thecreation of a syntactic diction-ary provided with frames contain-ing information about deep casesand their morphemic counterpartsof particular lexical items(Czech verbs).IntroductionIn the project MATRACE I(MAchine TRAnslation betweenCzech and English) the first aimis to create two parallel textcorpora (Czech and English),morphological ly and syntacticallytagged.
Then it will be possibleto use these corpora not only forcreating an MT system but alsofor other l inguistic research,needed e.g.
for systems of NLunderstanding.
For these purposeswe try to make the syntacticrepresentation "broader" so thatthe further work would be easier.I Project MATRACE, a researchproject of the Institute ofApplied and Formal Linguisticsand the Institute of Theoreticaland Computational Linguistics, iscarried out within the IBM Aca-demic Initiative project inCzechoslovakia.In the syntactic representationof a sentence, based on depend-ency grammar, we will specify notonly the dependency and syntacticroles of the modif ications butalso their underlying counter-parts (i.e.
"deep cases").
Forthis sort of tagging we need adictionary with morphological andsyntactic information, whichconsists of morphological para-digms of single words and theirvalency frames containing bothsyntactic and underlying roles oftheir members.
As there is nosuch dictionary in machine-rea-dable form we have to create it.Unfortunately we even cannotextract the words with theirframes from an existing corpus aswe are only creating it.
What wehave is a morphological diction-ary, which is to be enriched bythe syntactic information.
Thelinguist adding this informationshould enter the surface frameand specify its underlying coun-terpart.
We try to help him/herby automating the choice of theappropr ia te  cor respondencebetween "surface" and "deep"cases.In this paper we will con-centrate on the problems of verband its valency slots.
The gener-alization of our method for nounsand adjectives will not be diffi-cult as in many cases the syntac-tic frame of these words is justderived from the correspondingverb.AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANfES, 23-28 AO6-F 1992 8 8 5 l'Roc, ol: COLING-92, NANrEs, Au~3.23-28, 1992Theoretical backgroundUsing the framework of thefunct ional  generat ive descr ipt ion(FGP, see Sgal l  et al 1986),s l ight ly  s impl i f ied for the pur-pose of this paper, we dist in-guish two levels: a level ofunder ly ing  structure (US, withthe par t i c ipants  or "deep cases")and a level of surface structure(SS, morphemic  units  as parts ofthis are used here).
As for themodi f i cat ions  of verbs we dist in-guish inner par t ic ipants  and freemodi f i cat ions  (see Panevov~ 1974-5).
This can be understood as theparad igmat ica l  c lass i f i cat ion ofall poss ib le  verbal  modi f icat i -ons.
The other  d imension of theirc lass i f i cat ion  (combinator ic orsyntagmat ic  dimension) concernstheir  ob l igator iness  and opt iona-l ity wi th  the part icu lar  lexicalitem wi th in  the verbal  frame.
Theverbal  frame contains slots forob l igatory  and opt ional  innerpar t i c ipants  (which wi l l  bef i l led by the labels for "deepcases" and corresponding mor-phemic  forms) and obl igatory freemodi f icat ions.
The d i f ferencebetween an obl igatory andopt ional  part ic ipant  is importantfor a parser, however, we wil lleave this d ichotomy aside inthis contr ibut ion.The fo l lowing operat ionalcr i ter ia  for d is t ingu ish ingbetween inner par t ic ipants  andfree modi f i cat ions  are used: Ifthe verbal  mod i f i ca t ion  can occuronly once wi th  a single verbtoken and if the govern ing verbsfor a par t i cu lar  modi f i cat ion  maybe listed, the modi f i cat ion  iscons idered as an "inner part ic i -pant".
There are five part ic i -pants :  Ac tor ,  Ob jec t ive ,Addressee, Or ig in  and Effect.
Theother modi f i cat ions  (Time,Locative, Direct ion, Aim, Reason,Instrument, Regard, Manner etc.
)can reoccur  with a s ingle verbtoken and may modi fy  any verb.With some verbs free modi f ica-t ions can also enter  the respect-ive verb frame: e i ther  the con-struct ion is ungrammat ica l  with-out them (to behave HOW, to lastHOW LONG, to l ive WHERE etc.)
orthey are semant ica l ly  obl igatory,although they can be omitted onthe SS level.
This can be testedby a d ia logue of the fo l lowingtype:A.
My fr iend came.B.
Where?A.
*I don't  know.Unacceptabi l i ty  of the answer "Idon't  know" indicates that themodi f icat ion  where is a part  ofa verbal frame of the verb tocome.Accord ing to the theoryproposed by Panevov~ (1974-5,esp.
?
5) the fo l lowing conse-quences are accepted here: If averb has only one inner part ic i -pant then this par t i c ipant  isActor.
If a verb has two part ic i -pants then these are Actor  andObjective.
As fo~ the l"and 2 ~part ic ipant  our approach is s imi-lar to Tesni~re 's  (1959).
How-ever, if three or even more slotsof a verbal  frame are occupiedthen semant ic  cons iderat ions  areinvolved.
This is d i f fe rent  fromTesni~re's  so lut ion and does notful ly coincide with F i l lmore 'sproposals (Fi l lmore 1968, 1970).Determin ing the Addressee,Or ig in and Effect is rather  dif-f icult and requires tak ing intoaccount the combinat ion  of sur-face cases in the frame (includ-ing the form of the Object ive),the animacy of s ingle members  ofthe frame etc.
Though there is noone-to-one mapping between "deepcases" and "surface cases", weare able to d iscover  certa inregular i t ies  and prov ide somegenera l i zat ion re f lected in analgorithm.ObservationIn in f lect ional  languageswith (morphological) cases it isapparent that some cases aretypical  for certa in part ic ipants .Object ive is typ ica l ly  rea l izedAcrEs DE COLING-92.

in Czechthere are other  typical (preposi-tional) cases.
Thus z+Genit ive(out of sb, st) or od+Genit ive(from sb, st) ar~ typica l  forOrigin, ha+Accusat ive (at st),do+Genit ive (to st) or v+Accu-sative (into sb, st) are typicalfor E f fect  etc.
This wel l  knownfact led us to the idea of creat-ing a program as a tool for in~t roduc ing verbal  f rames (to beused even by researchers  withoutdeep l ingu is t ic  training) basedon correspondences between sur~face and deep caseE;.
At f~rst wesorted the Czech v~rb~ into fourgroups:i. Verbs  w i thout  Nominat ive  intheir  frames.Examples:pr~i\[(it) rains\]hudl mi (Act (Dat) ) v h lav~\[(it) is buzz ing to me in head\](my head is buzzing)This group conta ins  verbs withempty f rames but also a few verbswith very  untyp ica l  frames.
Ifthe f rame conta ins  only one par~t ic ipant,  then this is obvious lyan Actor.
if there are at leasttwo par t i c ipants  in the frame andone of them is Dative, then thisis the Actor.
If, bes ide this,only one more  par t i c ipant  occursin the frame, it is necessar i lythe Object ive.
All other verbsmust be t reated  ind iv idual ly  bya l inguist  as a kind of excep~tion.2.
Verbs  w i th  Nominat ive  and atmost  one more inner part ic ipant.Examples  :on (Act (Nora)) zemfel\[he died\]Jan  (Act  (Nora)) vidfi_rii (ob3 (Ace))\[John sees Mary\]ze semene (Obj (Prep (z) 4Gen) )rostl strom (Act (Nora))\[from a seed grew a tree\]to(obj (Nora)) se mi (Act (Dat) ) libl\[it to me appeals\] (I l ike it)Ma~.vy ~.Acco i 'd i i l%(  to  the the~)~'y, if theframe contains'; only one part ic i -pant, it is Actor,.
if it conta instwo part~cipants~ one of them isActor  and the othe~: is Object ive.Nominat ive  usua l ly  represents  theActor  but there is an except ionto this rule: if the other  par~t ic ipant  is in Dative, then th ispart ic ipant  is the Actor  and theNominat ive  represents the Objec-tive.
Reasonab i l i ty  of th is  ex-ceptiot| call be proved by t rans-lating par t icu lar  verbs  intoother languages, ~n which  thesurface frames are d i f fe rentwhi le  there is no obv ious  reasonwhy the deep frames should  d i f -fer~ Thus e.g.

In "nominat ive" lan-guages the verbal  frame ~t  ObjAddr  can be cons idered as central(while e.g.
Aat  (Obj) Addr is nottypical) .
Moreover,  the corre-spondences between US and SS asAct  -> Nom, Obj -> Ace, Addr ->Dat can be t reated as prototypes(while e.g.
