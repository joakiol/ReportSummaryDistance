According to Du Bois (1987)'s studies ofinformation flow in discourse across a numberof languages, information distribution amongargument positions in clauses is by no meansrandom, but cemdn grammatical patterns tend torecur consistently.
He thus formulated aPreferred Argument Structure (PAS) for thepreferential  structural conf igurat ions ofarguments.
In our examination of Chinesenarrative discourse, the language also displaysPAS, yet the Chinese PAS challenges timuniversality of the one Du Bois proposed.Based on the quantity and distribution of lexicalarguments  and new referents  acrossgrammatical roles in discourse, it is realized thatChinese PAS also maintains one new argumentat most within a basic information processiugunit.
Since new referents in Chinese have to beencoded in full NP form, it is thus less likely tohave more than one lexical argument within aclause.
Moreover, this single new argumentappears preferentially in the O role, rather thanthe A and S roles Du Bois's PAS formulates.Since the structure of information flow has acorresponding rammatical patterning, bothgrammatical and pragmatic processing can becarried out s imultaneously,  in that theinformation status of an argument can beidentified by virtue of grammatical analysis.Althougll PAS is neither universal norcategorical, it can function in a discourseunderstanding model as heuristic device toprocess the information structure of a connectedspoken discourse.According to Du Bois (1987)'s studies ofinformation flow in discourse across a numberof languages, information distribution amongargument positions is neither arbitrary norrandom, but certain grammatical patterns arepreferred over others, especially they tend torecur consistently in a connected spokendiscourse, hi other words, the structure ofinformation f low has a correspondinggrammatical patterning.
Those recurrentpatterns, which indeed reflect speakers' actuallanguage use, are formulated as PreferredArgument Structure (PAS) The PAS heformulated comprises the following constraints:One Lexical Argument Constraint to avoid morethan one referent in full NP form per clause,Non-Lexical A Constraint to have the singlelexical referent not appearing in the A role, OneNew Argument Constraint o avoid more thanone referent carrying new information perclause, Given A Constraint to have the newreferent not appeariug in the A role.
However,in examining Chinese narrative discourse, it isdiscovered that the PAS that this particular typeof discourse genre displays challenges theuniversality of Du Bois's.
The idiosyncrasy ofthe Ctlinese PAS will be discussed in thispaper.in fact, from the computational point ofview, no matter it is universal or language-specific, the existence of PAS has significantimplication to discourse understanding.
On theone band, it enables grammatical nd pragmaticprocessing being carried out simultaneouslybecause the information status of a referent canbe identified by virtue of grammatical nalysis;on the other hand, PAS can function as heuristicdevice to process the information structure of aconnected discourse.1.
IntroductionThe main purpose of communication is toexchange intbrmation.
On the part of a speaker,he may employ various strategies to organizethe information he intends to couvey, in thatsome bear old information while others carrynew information.
Therefore, a discourseunderstanding model should be able to processthe flow of information throughout the entiretext.
In this paper, our issue is tbcused on thereferring arguments in Chinese narrativediscourse, and our main concern is how theyare structured in relation to infom~ation flow.2.
Preferred Argument Structure inChinese Narrative DiscourseUnlike the languages Du Bois has studied(1987), Mandarin Chinese is a typologicallydifferent language with no inflection andrelatively free word order.
Nevertheless, it stillexlfibits its own idiosyncratic PAS in spokennarrative discourse.
The corpus for the presentstudy comprises eight oral narratives as told byeight Mandarin native speakers of 20-25 yearsold.
They were requested to describe the storyabout thc popular movie Ghost to theinterviewer in a speech laboratory.

The uarratives were tapedfor later transcription.To study the Chinese PAS, our examinationis focused on the issues of quantity and role iudistributing lexical arguments and new referentsacross grammatical positions at both thegrammatical nd pragmatic dimensions.2.1 Preliminaries for AnalysisSegmentation f the 120 minutes long narrativeswas subject o intonation unit being identifiedby eat' as at stretch of speech uttered under asingle coherent intonation contour and typicallybounded by a pause.
Chafe (1987) hltshypothesized that intonation units representinglinguistic expressions of focuses ofconsciousness are independent processing unitstypical of spoken discourse.
In the presentcorpus, there were a total of 1433 intonationunits, with a mean length of 6.69 words.
Thefact that the clause being defined as a verb andits arguments, and the intonation unit oftencoincide (Du Bois, 1987; Chafe, 1987, 1988)was further confirmed in this study, sittce85.28% (1222) intonation units containedclausal elements.
Those units comt~rised falsestarts, repetitions, filled pauses, as well asclause fragments such as conjunctions,adverbials, and particles would be excludedfrom further analysis.
Therefore, tile study ofChinese PAS is indeed based on chmses.Following is a sample of five clausal intonationunits (a-e) produced by a female speaker:(1) a. jiouyitian ta genzhe ta nupengyouone day he follow his girlfriend'One day, he followed his girlfriend.'b.
zai ta nupengyou ji~di deshihouin bis girlfriend home when'When (he was) in his gMfriend's tlome,'c.

ranhou you yi ge huztirenthen there-be one CI~ bad guy'Then, there was a bad guy.'e.
huairen chuang finialbad guy break in'The bad guy broke in.
'Within a single clause, the molphologicaltype of each referent, its gramnlatical role, aswell as information status were all recorded.The morphological type of an overt referent inChinese was either a lexical NP or a pronoun,whose surface grammatical role would beclassified as A (transitive subject), S(intransitive subject), O (transitive object), orOblique (object of a preposition).
Furthermore,Chafe (1987)'s three-way distinction ofinformation tbr referents was adopted, mainlybecause his categories lay their foundation onthe actual cognitive processing of informationtransfer by language users.
They were giveninformation, accessible information, and newinformation.
A given referent referred to theentity mentioned previously, while a newrefi~rent was the one that had uot yet beenbrought up in the prior context.
Internlediatebetween these two was accessible information,either coming from the expectations a sociatedwith a schema or resulting ti~om deactivationfrom an earlier state.
Following Du Bois(1987), a referent constituted by deactivationshould be at least twenty propositions awayfrom its most recent appeluance operationally.2.2 The Grammatical Dimension of PASThe purpose of studying PAS at thegrammatical dimension is to examine whetherthere is a prefen'ed surface configuration ofarguments in the observed ata.
Therefore, weinvestigate both the number of lexical (NP)argmnents and their distribution across thegranunatical roles in clauses.According to our tabulation shown in TableI, of the 1127 clauses (excluding the equationaltype), those with zero or one lexical argumentare the most common structure which constitutea distinct majority (94.15%).Table 1.

\]'heresult indeed supports Du Bois's One LexicalArguanent Cot~'traint in that "there is a tendencyfor speakers to avoid more than one lexicalargument per clause" ( p.819).?

According to our tabulationas shown in Table 3, it is realized that O(84.3%) and Oblique (92.31%) each contain anoverwhelming proportion of lexical arguments,whereas A and S contain a smaller portion ofthem.Table 3.

(3) = 91.17)Unlike Du Bois's Non-Lexical A Constraintto avoid lexical referents appearing in the Aposition, Chinese speakers would not prefer theA and S roles to mention a referent lexically.
Itis the position O (or Oblique) that preferentiallyfavors lexical arguments.
The Lexical 0Constraint is thus proposed to characterize thisparticular phenomenon i  Chinese narrativediscourse.
In short, the One Lexical ArgumentConstraint and the Lexical 0 Constraint, whichare indeed the constraints on quantity and rolerespectively, constitute the Chinese PAS at thegrammatical dimension.
The quantity of lexicalargument within a clause is usually one at most,and this single argument preferentially appearsin the O role.
Although they are not categoricalrules, they do represent a statistically significanttendency of actual language use.2.3 The Pragmatic Dimension of PASIn the preceding section, it has been shown thatin narrative discourse different argumentposit ions of a clause have dist inctmorphological preferences.
This section aims atstudying the pragmatic dimension of PAS byexamining the quantity of new arguments, aswell as their distribution across the grammaticalroles.Firstly, it is found that transitive andintransitive clauses either contain zero or onenew referent, with the former predominating(81.06%), as indicated by Table 5.Significantly, not a single clause contains twonew referents.
The result supports Du Bois'sOne New Argument Constraint o "avoid morethan one new argument per clause" (p.826).Table 5.

As indicated in Table 6, a substantialproportion of A and S carry old information,and new referents preferentially occur in O andOblique.ACRES DE CO\[3NG-92, Nar~q'Es, 23-28 AO(JT 1992 1 1 4 4 Paoc.

SinceChinese speakers disfaw)r both the A and Sroles to mention a new referent, Du Bois'sGiven A Constraint, which "avoids introducinga new referent in the A-role argument position"(p.827), is inappropriate to Chinese narrativediscourse.
The New 0 Constraint is thenproposed for Chinese to characterize the freeoccurrence of new referents in the O role, aswell as the high restriction in the A and S roles.Tahte 7.

(14122 51.0581 33.89239 ~" I(X)( X2.99 (3) = 131.96)Comparing the frequency distribution of A andS, it is even rare for A to code new referents.This can be explained by the fact that Chineseincludes a type of presentative constructionwhich "performs the function of introducinginto a discourse a norm phrase naming anentity" (Li & Thompson, 1981).
Verbs of thissentence type are usually intransitive, and thefo l lowing arguments usually carry newinformation.
Since speakers do not necessarilyuse presentative constructions to introduce anew entity, they merely constitute a minority(20 clauses) in our corpus, as exemplified in (2)and (3).

'(3) fie shang you yi ge zhaopai yastreet on exist one CL signboard PART'On the street, here is a signboard.
'In short, the One New Argument Constraintand the New 0 Constraint constitute theChinese PAS at the pragmatic dimension.There is a strong tendency in discourse to limitthe number of new ~ugument in a clause to amaximum of one.
This single new referenttends to be introduced in the O (or Oblique) roleand the second occurrences preferentially appearin the A and S roles.
It is of  course thispreponderance of old information found in the{A, S} al ignment that gives Chinese thedistinction of being a topic-prominent language.2.4 Corre lat ion of  PAS between Gram-matical and Pragmatic DimensionsWe have already studied the quantity and therole constraints that constitute PAS for Chinesenarrative discourse at both the grammatical ndpragmatic dimensions.
The correlation of PASbetween these two dimensions i so strong thatthe grammatical One Lexical ArgumentConstraint and Lexical 0 Constraint are parallelto the pragmatic One New Argument Constraintand New 0 Cor~traint respectively, as shownin Table 8.
In other words, the most preferredstructure is to have one new argument at mostwithin a single clause.
Since new referents inChinese have to be coded in full NP form, it isthus less likely to include more than one lexicalargument within one discourse unit.
Moreover,there is a strong tendency for the single newargument to appear in the O role, so that thelexical referent typically appear in this particularposition.
The flow of information does have acorresponding grammatical patterning.Table 8.

As the PAS in Sacapultecavoids mentioning new lexical arguments in theA role, Chinese speakers disfavor both the Aand S roles and strongly prefer O.Table 9.

Implication of PAS to DiscourseUnderstandingChinese, like a number of other languageswhose pattern of information flow in spokennarrative discourse has been investigated todate, also exhibits PAS.
This suggests thatthere is a strong discourse pressure driving thevarious grammatical patterning in differentlanguages, o that the universality of the PASDu Bois proposed encounters challenge.However, from the computational point ofview, no matter whether PAS is universal orlanguage-specific, its existence has significantimplication to discourse understanding, in thatthe flow of information throughout a connecteddiscourse is highly structured with acorresponding grammatical patterning as far asquantity and role are concerned.
Therefore, it ispossible to identify the information status of anargument by virtue of grammatical nalysis, sothat both grammatical nd pragmatic processingcan be carried out simultaneously.
Even thoughPAS is not categorical in nature, a discourseunderstanding model can still use it as heuristicdevice to process the information structure of aconnected spoken discourse.In short, a discourse understanding modelemploying PAS for information processingshould take the following points intoconsideration:(a) Clauses are the basic information processingunits.
(b) Transitive and intransitive clauses hould beseperated for analysis.
(c) The morphological type, grammatical role,and information status should he recordedfor each argument position.
(d) The quantity and role constraints are theheuristic principles for informationprocessing.4.
Conclusionhi this paper, we have demonstrated thatChinese narrative discourse also displaysPreferred Argument Structure based on thequantity and distribution of lexieal argumentsand new referents across grammatical roles.However, the Chinese PAS challenges theuniversality of the one Du Bois proposed,because they differ in the distribution of lexicalarguments and new referents acrossgrammatical roles.
In other words, thediscourse pressure driving the variousgrammatical patterning in different languagesreflects the underlying pragmatic preference ofthe different groups of language users.From the computational viewpoint, nomatter whether PAS is universal or language-specific, its existence has significant implicationto discourse understanding.
On the one hand,PAS can function in a discourse understandingmodel as a heuristic device to process theinformation structure of a connected spokendiscourse; on the other hand, the informationstatus of an argument can be identified by virtueof grammatical analysis since the flow ofinformation has a corresponding grammaticalpatterning,ReferencesChafe, Wallace L. 1987.
