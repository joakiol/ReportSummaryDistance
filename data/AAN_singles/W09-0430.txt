31 March 2009. c?2009 Association for Computational LinguisticsMining a comparable text corpus for a Vietnamese - Frenchstatistical machine translation systemThi-Ngoc-Diep Do *,**, Viet-Bac Le *, Brigitte Bigi*,Laurent Besacier*, Eric Castelli***LIG Laboratory, CNRS/UMR-5217, Grenoble, France** MICA Center, CNRS/UMI-2954, Hanoi, Vietnamthi-ngoc-diep.do@imag.frAbstractThis paper presents our first attempt at con-structing a Vietnamese-French statisticalmachine translation system.
Since Vietnam-ese is an under-resourced language, we con-centrate on building a large Vietnamese-French parallel corpus.
A document align-ment method based on publication date, spe-cial words and sentence alignment result isproposed.
The paper also presents an appli-cation of the obtained parallel corpus to theconstruction of a Vietnamese-French statis-tical machine translation system, where theuse of different units for Vietnamese (sylla-bles, words, or their combinations) is dis-cussed.1 IntroductionOver the past fifty years of development, ma-chine translation (MT) has obtained good resultswhen applied to several pairs of languages suchas English, French, German, Japanese, etc.
How-ever, for under-resourced languages, it still re-mains a big gap.
For instance, althoughVietnamese is the 14th widely-used language inthe world, research on MT for Vietnamese isvery rare.The earliest MT system for Vietnamese is thesystem from the Logos Corporation, developedas an English-Vietnamese system for translatingaircraft manuals during the 1970s (Hutchins,2001).
Until now, in Vietnam, there are only fourresearch groups working on MT for Vietnamese-English (Ho, 2005).
However the results are stillmodest.MT research on Vietnamese-French occurseven more rarely.
Doan (2001) proposed a trans-lation module for Vietnamese within ITS3, amultilingual MT system based on the classicalanalysis-transfer-generation approach.
Nguyen(2006) worked on Vietnamese language andVietnamese-French text alignment.
But no com-plete MT system for this pair of languages hasbeen published so far.There are many approaches for MT: rule-based(direct translation, interlingua-based, transfer-based), corpus-based (statistical, example-based)as well as hybrid approaches.
We focus on build-ing a Vietnamese-French statistical machinetranslation (SMT) system.
Such an approach re-quires a parallel bilingual corpus for source andtarget languages.
Using this corpus, we build astatistical translation model for source/target lan-guages and a statistical language model for targetlanguage.
Then the two models and a searchmodule are used to decode the best translation(Brown et al, 1993; Koehn et al, 2003).Thus, the first task is to build a large parallelbilingual text corpus.
This corpus can be de-scribed as a set of bilingual sentence pairs.
At themoment, such a large parallel corpus for Viet-namese-French is unavailable.
(Nguyen, 2006)presents a Vietnamese-French parallel corpus oflaw and economics documents.
Our SMT systemwas trained using Vietnamese-French news cor-pus created by mining a comparable bilingualtext corpus from the Web.Section 2 presents the general methodology ofmining a comparable text corpus.
We present anoverview of document alignment methods andsentence alignment methods, and discuss thedocument alignment method we utilized, whichis based on publishing date, special words, andsentence alignment results.
Section 3 describesour experiments in automatically mining a multi-lingual news website to create a Vietnamese-French parallel text corpus.
Section 4 presents165our application to rapidly build Vietnamese-French SMT systems using the obtained parallelcorpus, where the use of different units for Viet-namese (syllables, words, or their combination) isdiscussed.
Section 5 concludes and discusses fu-ture work.2 Mining a comparable text corpusIn (Munteanu and Daniel Marcu, 2006), the au-thors present a method for extracting parallelsub-sentential fragments from comparable bilin-gual corpora.
However this method is in need ofan initial parallel bilingual corpus, which is notavailable for the pair of language Vietnamese-French (in the news domain).The overall process of mining a bilingual textcorpus which is used in a SMT system typicallytakes five following steps (Koehn, 2005): rawdata collection, document alignment, sentencesplitting, tokenization and sentence alignment.This section presents the two main steps: docu-ment alignment and sentence alignment.
We alsodiscuss the proposed document alignmentmethod.2.1 Document alignmentLet S1 be set of documents in language L1; let S2be set of documents in language L2.
Extractingparallel documents or aligning documents fromthe two sets S1, S2 can be seen as finding thetranslation document D2 (in the set S2) of adocument D1 (in the set S1).
We call this pair ofdocuments D1-D2 a parallel document pair(PDP).For collecting bilingual text data for the twosets S1, S2, the Web is an ideal source as it islarge, free and available (Kilgarriff and Grefen-stette, 2003).
For this kind of data, various meth-ods to align documents have been proposed.Documents can be simply aligned based on theanchor link, the clue in URL (Kraaij et al, 2003)or the web page structure (Resnik and Smith,2003).
However, this information is not alwaysavailable or trustworthy.
The titles of documentsD1, D2 can also be used (Yang and Li, 2002), butsometimes they are completely different.Another useful source of information is invari-ant words, such as named entities, dates, andnumbers, which are often common in news data.We call these words special words.
(Patry andLanglais, 2005) used numbers, punctuation, andentity names to measure the parallelism betweentwo documents.
The order of this information indocument is used as an important criterion.
How-ever, this order is not always respected in a PDP(see an example in Table 1).French document Vietnamese documentSelon l'Administrationnationale du tourisme, lesvoyageurs en provenance del'Asie du Nord-Est (Japon,R?publique de Cor?e,...)repr?sentent 33%, de l'Eu-rope, 16%, de l'Am?riquedu Nord, 13%, d'Australieet de Nouvelle-Z?lande, 6%.En outre, depuis le d?butde cette ann?e, environ 2,8millions de touristes ?tran-gers ont fait le tour du Viet-nam, 78% d'eux sont venuspar avion.Cela t?moigne d'un af-flux des touristes riches auVietnam.

An example of a French-Vietnameseparallel document pair in our corpus.2.2 Sentence alignmentFrom a PDP D1-D2, the sentence alignmentprocess identifies parallel sentence pairs (PSPs)between two documents D1 and D2.
For eachD1-D2, we have a set SenAlignmentD1-D2 ofPSPs.SenAlignmentD1-D2 = {?sen1-sen2?| sen1 iszero/one/many sentence(s) in document D1,sen2 is zero/one/many sentence(s) in docu-ment D2, sen1-sen2 is considered as aPSP}.We call a PSP sen1-sen2 alignment type m:nwhen sen1 contains m consecutive sentences andsen2 contains n consecutive sentences.Several automatic sentence alignment ap-proaches have been proposed based on sentencelength (Brown et al, 1991) and lexical informa-tion (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993).
A hybrid ap-proach is presented in (Gale and Church, 1993)whose basic hypothesis is that ?longer sentencesin one language tend to be translated into longersentences in the other language, and shorter sen-tences tend to be translated into shorter sen-tences?.
Some toolkits such as Hunalign1 andVanilla2 implement these approaches.
However,they tend to work best when documents D1, D2contain few sentence deletions and insertions,and mainly contain PSPs of type 1:1.1http://mokk.bme.hu/resources/hunalign2http://nl.ijs.si/telri/Vanilla/166Ma (2006) provides an open source softwarecalled Champollion1 to solve this limitation.Champollion permits alignment type m:n (m, n =0,1,2,3,4), so the length of sentence does not playan important role.
Champollion uses also lexicalinformation (lexemes, stop words, bilingual dic-tionary, etc.)
to align sentences.
Champollion caneasily be adapted to new pairs of languages.Available language pairs in Champollion areEnglish-Arabic and English-Chinese (Ma, 2006).2.3 Our document alignment methodFigure 1 describes our methodology for docu-ment alignment.
For each document D1 in the setS1, we find the aligned document D2 in the setS2.We propose to use publishing date, specialwords, and the results of sentence alignment todiscover PDPs.
First, the publishing date is usedto reduce the number of possible documents D2.Then we use a filter based on special words con-tained in the documents to determine the candi-date documents D2.
Finally, we eliminatecandidates in D2 based on the combination ofdocument length information and lexical infor-mation, which are extracted from the results ofsentence alignment.Figure 1.
Our document alignment scheme.2.3.1 The first filter: publishing dateWe assume that the document D2 is translatedand published at most n days after the publishingdate of the original document.
We do not knowwhether D1 or D2 is the original document, so1http://champollion.sourceforge.netwe assume that D2 is published n days before orafter D1.
After filtering by publishing date crite-rion, we obtain a subset S2?
containing possibledocuments D2.2.3.2 The second filter: special wordsIn our case, the special words are numbers andnamed entities.
Not only numbers (0-9) but alsoattached symbols (?$?, ?%?, ??
?, ?,?, ?.??)
areextracted from documents, for example:?12.000$?
; ?13,45?
; ?50%?;?
Named entitiesare specified by one or several words in whichthe first letter of each word is upper case, e.g.
?Paris?, ?Nations Unies?
in French.While named entities in language L1 are usu-ally translated into the corresponding names inlanguage L2, in some cases the named entities inL1 (such as personal names or organizationnames) do not change in L2.
In particular, manyVietnamese personal names are translated intoother languages by removal of diacritical marks(see examples in Table 2).French Vietnamese Vietnamese-RemoveddiacriticNationsUniesLi?n H?pQu?cLien HopQuocChangedFrance Ph?p PhapASEAN ASEAN ASEANNong DucManhN?ng ?

Some examples of named entities inFrench-Vietnamese.All special words are extracted from documentD1.
This gives a list of special words w1,w2,?wn.For each special word, we search in the set S2?documents D2 which contain this special word.For each word, we obtain a list of documents D2.The document D2 which has the biggest numberof appearance in all lists is chosen.
It is thedocument containing the highest number of spe-cial words.
We can find zero, one or severaldocuments which are satisfactory.
We call thisset of documents set S2??
(see in Figure 2).The way that we use special words is differentfrom the way used in (Patry and Langlais, 2005).We do not use punctuation as special words.
Weuse the attached symbols (?$?, ?%?, ??
?, ?)
withthe number.
Furthermore, in our method, the or-der of special words in documents is not impor-tant, and if a special word appears several timesin a document, it does not affect the result.S1 S2Filter by publishing date(?n days)S2?S2???S2?

Using special words to filter documentsD2.2.3.3 The third filter: sentence alignmentsAs mentioned in section 2.3.2, for each documentD1, we discover a set S2?
?, which contains zero,one or several documents D2.
When we continueto align sentences for each PDP D1-D2, we get alot of low quality PSPs.
The results of sentencealignment allow us to further filter the documentsD2.After aligning sentences, we have a set ofPSPs, SenAlignmentD1-D2, for each PDP D1-D2.We add two rules to filter documents D2.When D1-D2 is not a true PDP, it is hard tofind out PSPs.
So we note the number of PSPs inthe set SenAlignmentD1-D2 bycard(SenAlignmentD1-D2).
The number of sentencepairs which can not find their alignment partner(when sen1 or sen2 is ?null?)
is noted bynbr_omitted(SenAlignmentD1-D2).When ?>)ignmentcard(SenAl)mentd(SenAlignnbr_omitteD2-D1D2-D1, thisPDP D1-D2 will be eliminated.This first rule also deals with the problem ofdocument length, sentence deletions and sentenceinsertions.The second rule makes use of lexical informa-tion.
For each PSP, we add two scores xL1 and xL2for sen1 and sen2.iiLiseninwordsofnumberseninwordstranslatedofnumberx????????
?=Translated words are words having translationequivalents in the other sentence.
In this rule, wedo not take into account the stop words.
Table 3shows an example for calculating two scores xL1and xL2  for a PSP.In the second rule, when all PSPs in Se-nAlignmentD1-D2 have two scores xL1 and xL2 thatare both smaller than ?, this PDP D1-D2 will beeliminated.
This rule removes the low qualityPDP which creates a set of low quality PSPs.sen1 (in French) : ils ont ?chang?

Example for calculating two scores xL1and xL2.After using three filters based on informationof publishing date, special words, and the resultsof sentence alignment, we have a corpus ofPDPs, and also a corpus of corresponding PSPs.To ensure the quality of output PSPs, we cancontinue to filter PSPs.
For example, we can keeponly the PSPs whose scores (xL1 and xL2) arehigher than a threshold.3 Experiments3.1 Characteristics of VietnameseThe basic unit of the Vietnamese language is syl-lable.
In writing, syllables are separated by awhite space.
One word corresponds to one ormore syllables (Nguyen, 2006).

The syntactic functions are also deter-mined by the order of words in the sentence(Nguyen, 2006).3.2 Data collectingIn order to build a Vietnamese-French paralleltext corpus, we applied our proposed methodol-ogy to mine a comparable text corpus from aVietnamese daily news website, the VietnamNews Agency1 (VNA).
This website containsnews articles written in four languages (Vietnam-ese, English, French, and Spanish) and divided in9 categories including ?Politics - Diplomacy?,?Society - Education?, ?Business - Finance?,?Culture - Sports?, ?Science - Technology?,?Health?, ?Environment?, ?Asian corner?
and?World?.
However, not all of the Vietnamesearticles have been translated into the other threelanguages.
The distribution of the amount of datain four languages is shown in figure 3.Figure 3.
Distribution of the amount of data foreach language on VNA website.Each document (i.e., article) can be obtainedvia a permanent URL link from VNA.
To date,we have obtained about 121,000 documents infour languages, which are gathered from 12 April2006 to 14 August 2008; each document con-tains, on average, 10 sentences, with around 30words per sentence.3.3 Data pre-processingWe splitted the collected data into 2 sets.
Thedevelopment set, designated SDEV, contained1000 documents, was used to tune the miningsystem parameters.
The rest of data, designatedSTRAIN, was used as a training set, where the esti-mated parameters were applied to build the entirecorpus.
We applied the following pre-process toeach set SDEV and STRAIN:1.
Extract contents from documents.1http://www.vnagency.com.vn/2.
Classify documents by language (usingTextCat2, an n-gram based language identi-fication).3.
Process and clean both Vietnamese andFrench documents by using the CLIPS-Text-Tk toolkit (LE et al, 2003): convert html totext file, convert character code, segmentsentence, segment word.
The resulting cleancorpora are S1 (for French) and S2 (forVietnamese).3.4  Parameters estimationOur proposed document alignment method wasapplied to the sets S1 and S2 extracted from theset SDEV.
To filter by publishing date, we as-sumed that n=2.The second filter was implemented on the setS1 and the new set S2* which was created by re-moving diacritical marks from the set S2 (in thecase of Vietnamese).The sentence alignment process was imple-mented by using data from sets S1, S2 and theChampollion toolkit.
We adapted Champollion toVietnamese-French by changing some parame-ters: the ratio of French word to Vietnamesetranslation word is set to 1.2, penalty for align-ment type 1-1 is set to 1, for type 0-1 to 0.8, fortype 2-1, 1-2 and 2-2 to 0.75, and we did not usethe other types (see more in (Ma, 2006)).
Afterusing two filters, the result data is shown in Table5.
The true PDPs were manually extracted.SDEV - Number of documents: 1000- Number of French documents: 173- Number of Vietnamese documents: 348- Number of true PDPs: 129S2??

The obtained corpus is presented in Table7.STRAIN - Number of documents: 120,218- Number of French documents: 20,884- Number of Vietnamese documents:54,406Entirecorpus- Number of PDPs: 12,108- Number of PSPs: 50,322Table 7.
The obtained corpus from STRAIN.4 Application: a Vietnamese - Frenchstatistical machine translation systemWith the obtained parallel corpus, we attemptedto rapidly build a SMT system for Vietnamese-French.
The system was built using the Mosestoolkit1.
The Moses toolkit contains all of thecomponents needed to train both the translationmodel and the language model.
It also containstools for tuning these models using minimumerror rate training and for evaluating the transla-tion result using the BLEU score (Koehn et al,2007).4.1 Preparing dataFrom the entire corpus, we chose 50 PDPs (351PSPs) for developing (Dev), 50 PDPs (384 PSPs)for testing (Tst), with the rest PDPs (49,587PSPs) reserved for training (Trn).Concerning the developing and testing PSPs,we manually verified and eliminated low qualityPSPs, which produced 198 good quality PSPs fordeveloping and 210 good quality PSPs for test-ing.
The data used to create the language modelwere extracted from 49,587 PSPs of the trainingset.4.2 Baseline systemWe built translation systems in two translationdirections: French to Vietnamese (FV) andVietnamese to French (VF).
The Vietnamesedata were segmented into either words or sylla-bles.
So we first have four translation systems.We removed sentences longer than 100words/syllables from the training and develop-1http://www.statmt.org/moses/ment sets according to the Moses condition (sothe number of PSPs used in the training set dif-fers slightly between systems).
All words foundare implicitly added to the vocabulary.System Direction Vietnamese issegmented into Nbr of PSPsS1FV FVS1VF VFSyllableTraining: 47,081Developing: 198Testing:        210S2FV FVS2VF VFWordTraining: 48,864Developing: 198Testing:        210System Set -LanguageNbr.

Our four translation systems.We obtained the performance results for thosesystems in Table 9.
In the case of the systemswhere Vietnamese was segmented into words,the Vietnamese sentences were changed back tosyllable representation before calculating theBLEU scores, so that all the BLEU scores evalu-ated can be compared to each other.S1FV S1VF S2FV S2VFBLEU  0.40 0.31 0.40 0.30Table 9.
Evaluation of SMTs on the Tst set.The BLEU scores for French to Vietnamesetranslation direction are around 0.40 and theBLEU scores for Vietnamese to French transla-tion direction are around 0.31, which is encour-aging as a first result.
Moreover, only onereference was used to estimate BLEU scores inour experiments.
It is also interesting to note thatsegmenting Vietnamese sentences into words orsyllables does not significantly change the per-formance for both translation directions.

In fact, theMoses toolkit supports the combination ofphrase-tables.
The phrase-tables of the systemS1VF (Tsyl) and system S2VF (Tword) were used.Another phrase-table (Tword*) was created fromthe Tword, in which all words in the phrase tablewere changed back into syllable representation(in this latter case, the word segmentation infor-mation was used during the alignment processand the phrase table construction, while the unitkept at the end remains the syllable).
The combi-nations of these three phrase-tables were alsocreated (by simple concatenation of the phrasetables).
The Vietnamese input for this experimentwas either in word or in syllable representation.As usual, the developing set was used for tuningthe log-linear weights and the testing set wasused to estimate the BLEU score.
The obtainedresults are presented in Table 11.
Some perform-ances are marked as X since those combinationsof input and phrase table do not make sense (forinstance the combination of input in words andsyllable-based phrase table).Input in syllable Input in word Phrase-tablesused Dev Tst Dev TstTsyl 0.35 0.31 X XTword X X 0.35 0.30Tword* 0.37 0.31 X XTsyl + Tword 0.35 0.31 0.36 0.30Tsyl + Tword* 0.38 0.32 X XTword + Tword* 0.37 0.30 0.36 0.30Table 11: The BLEU scores obtained from com-bination of phrase-tables on Dev set and Tst set(Vietnamese to French machine translation).These results show that the performance canbe improved by combining information fromword and syllable representations of Vietnamese.
(BLEU improvement from 0.35 to 0.38 on theDev set and from 0.31 to 0.32 on the Tst set).
Inthe future, we will analyze more the combinationof syllable and word units for Vietnamese MTand we will investigate the use of confusion net-works as an MT input, which have the advantageto keep both segmentations (word, syllable) intoa same structure.4.4 Comparing with Google Translate1Google Translate system has recently supportedVietnamese.
In most cases, it uses English as anintermediary language.
For the first comparativeevaluation, some simple tests were carried out.Two sets of data were used: in domain data set(the Tst set in section 4.2) and out of domain dataset.
The latter was obtained from a Vietnamese-French bilingual website2 which is not a newswebsite.
After pre-processing and aligning manu-ally, we obtained 100 PSPs in the out of domaindata set.
In these tests, the Vietnamese data weresegmented into syllables.
Both data sets wereinputted to our translation systems (S1FV, S1VF)and the Google Translate system.
The outputs ofGoogle Translate system were post-processed(lowercased) and then the BLEU scores wereestimated.
Table 12 presents the results of thesetests.
While our system is logically better for indomain data set, it is also slightly better thanGoogle for out of domain data set.1http://translate.google.com2http://www.ambafrance-vn.org171BLEU score  Direction Our system GoogleFV 0.40  0.25 In domain(210 PSPs) VF 0.31  0.16FV 0.25 0.24 Out of domain(100 PSPs) VF 0.20 0.16Table 12: Comparing with Google Translate.5 Conclusions and perspectivesIn this paper, we have presented our work onmining a comparable Vietnamese-French corpusand our first attempts at Vietnamese-FrenchSMT.
The paper has presented our documentalignment method, which is based on publicationdate, special words and sentence alignment re-sult.
The proposed method is applied to Vietnam-ese and French news data collected from VNA.For Vietnamese and French data, we obtainedaround 12,100 parallel document pairs and50,300 parallel sentence pairs.
This is our firstVietnamese-French parallel bilingual corpus.
Wehave built SMT systems using Moses.
The BLEUscores for French to Vietnamese translation sys-tems and Vietnamese to French translation sys-tems were 0.40 and 0.31 in turn.
Moreover,combining information from word and syllablerepresentations of Vietnamese can be useful toimprove the performance of Vietnamese MT sys-tem.In the future, we will attempt to increase thecorpus size (by using unsupervised SMT for in-stance) and investigate further the use of differentVietnamese lexical units (syllable, word) in a MTsystem.ReferencesBrown, Peter F., Jennifer C.
