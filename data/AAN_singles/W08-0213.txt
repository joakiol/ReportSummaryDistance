This pa-per describes the use of a computational en-vironment (SIDGrid) that facilitates interdis-ciplinary instruction by providing support forstudents with little computational backgroundas well as extending the scale of projects ac-cessible to students with more advanced com-putational skills.
The environment facilitatesthe use of hands-on exercises and is being ap-plied to interdisciplinary instruction in Dis-course and Dialogue.1 IntroductionTeaching Computational Linguistics poses manychallenges but also provides many opportunities.Students in Computational Linguistics courses comefrom diverse academic backgrounds, including com-puter science, linguistics, and psychology.
Thestudents enter with differing experience and expo-sure to programming, computational and mathemat-ical models, and linguistic, psycholinguistic and so-ciolinguistic theories that inform the practice andstudy of computational linguistics.
However, study-ing in a common class provides students with the op-portunity to gain exposure to diverse perspectives ontheir research problems and to apply computational?The work is supported by a University of Chicago Aca-demic Technology Innovation Grant.tools and techniques to expand the range and scopeof problems they can investigate.While there are many facets of these instructionalchallenges that must be addressed to support a suc-cessful course with a multi-disciplinary class andperspective, this paper focuses on the use and de-velopment of a computational environment to sup-port laboratory exercises for students from diversebackgrounds.
The framework aims to facilitate col-laborative projects, reduce barriers of entry for stu-dents with little prior computational experience, andto provide access to large-scale distributed process-ing resources for students with greater computa-tional expertise to expand the scope and scale oftheir projects and exercises.Specifically, we exploit the Social InformaticsData Grid (SIDGrid) framework developed as partof the NSF-funded Cyberinfrastructure project, ?Cy-berinfrastructure for Collaborative Research in theSocial and Behavioral Sciences (PI: Stevens)?, tosupport hands-on annotation and analysis exercisesin a computational linguistics course focused on dis-course and dialogue.
We begin by describing theSIDGrid framework for annotation, archiving, andanalysis of multi-modal, multi-measure data.
Wethen describe the course setting and the applica-tion of SIDGrid functionality to expand exercise andproject possibilities.
Finally, we discuss the impactof this framework for multi-disciplinary instructionin computational linguistics as well as the limita-tions of the current implementation of the frame-work.1062 SIDGrid Framework2.1 MotivationRecent research programs in multi-modal environ-ments, including understanding and analysis ofmulti-party meeting data and oral history recordingprojects, have created an explosion of multi-modaldata sets, including video and audio recordings,transcripts and other annotations, and increased in-terest in annotation and analysis of such data.
Anumber of systems have been developed to man-age and support annotation of multi-modal data, in-cluding Annotation Graphs (Bird and Liberman,2001), Exmeralda (Schmidt, 2004), NITE XMLToolkit (Carletta et al, 2003), Multitool (Allwoodet al, 2001), Anvil (Kipp, 2001), and Elan (Wit-tenburg et al, 2006).
The Social Informatics DataGrid (SIDGrid), developed under the NSF Cyberin-frastructure Program, aims to extend the capabilitiesof such systems by focusing on support for large-scale, extensible distributed data annotation, shar-ing, and analysis.
The system is open-source andmulti-platform and based on existing open-sourcesoftware and standards.
The system greatly eases theintegration of annotation with analysis though user-defined functions both on the client-side for data ex-ploration and on the TeraGrid for large-scale dis-tributed data processing.
A web-accessible repos-itory supports data search, sharing, and distributedannotation.
While the framework is general, anal-ysis of spoken and multi-modal discourse and dia-logue data is a primary application.The details of the system are presented below.Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 describe the annota-tion client, the web-accessible data repository, andthe portal to the TeraGrid, respectively, as shown inFigure 1 below.2.2 The SIDGrid ClientThe SIDGrid client provides an interactive multi-modal annotation interface, building on the open-source ELAN annotation tool from the Max PlanckInstitute1.
A screenshot appears in Figure 2.
ELANsupports display and synchronized playback of mul-tiple video files, audio files, and arbitrarily manyannotation ?tiers?
in its ?music-score?-style graph-ical interface.
The annotations are assumed to be1http://www.mpi.nl/tools/elan.htmlWeb-interfaceto TeraGrid &RepositoryClientData RepositoryTeraGridFigure 1: System ArchitectureFigure 2: Screenshot of the annotation client interface,with video, time-aligned textual annotations, and time se-ries displays.time-aligned intervals with, typically, text content;the system leverages Unicode to provide multilin-gual support.
Time series such as pitch tracks ormotion capture data can be displayed synchronously.The user may interactively add, edit, and do sim-ple search in annotations.
For example, in multi-modal multi-party spoken data, annotation tiers cor-responding to aligned text transcriptions, head nods,pause, gesture, and reference can be created.The client expands on this functionality by al-lowing the application of user-defined analysis pro-grams to media, time series, and annotations asso-ciated with the current project, such as a conver-sation, to yield time series files or annotation tiersdisplayed in the client interface.
Any program witha command-line or scriptable interface installed onthe user?s system may be added to a pull-down listfor invocation.
For example, to support a prosodic107analysis of multi-party meeting data, the user can se-lect a Praat (Boersma, 2001) script to perform pitchor intensity tracking.
Also, the client provides inte-grated import and export capabilities for the centralrepository.
New and updated experiments and an-notations may be uploaded directly to the archivefrom within the client interface.
Existing experi-ments may be loaded from local disk or downloadedfrom the repository for additional annotation.2.3 The SIDGrid RepositoryThe SIDGrid repository provides a web-accessible,central archive of multi-modal data, annotations, andanalyses.
This archive facilitates distributed anno-tation efforts by multiple researchers working on acommon data set by allowing shared storage and ac-cess to annotations, while keeping a history of up-dates to the shared data, annotations, and analysis.The browser-based interface to the archive allowsthe user to browse or search the on-line data col-lection by media type, tags, project identifier, andgroup or owner.
Once selected, all or part of any ex-periment may be downloaded.
In addition to lists ofexperiment names or thumbnail images, the web in-terface also provides a streaming preview of the se-lected media and annotations, allowing verificationprior to download.
(Figure 3)All data is stored in a MySQL database.
Anno-tation tiers are converted to an internal time-spanbased representation, while media and time seriesfiles are linked in unanalyzed.
This format allowsgeneration of ELAN format files for download to theclient tool without regard to the original source formof the annotation file.
The database structure furtherenables the potential for flexible search of the storedannotations both within and across multiple annota-tion types.2.4 The TeraGrid PortalThe large-scale multimedia data collected for multi-modal research poses significant computationalchallenges.
Signal processing of gigabytes of me-dia files requires processing horsepower that maystrain many local sites, as do approaches such asmulti-dimensional scaling for semantic analysis andtopic segmentation.
To enable users to more effec-tively exploit this data, the SIDGrid provides a por-tal to the TeraGrid (Pennington, 2002), the largestdistributed cyberinfrastructure for open scientificresearch, which uses high-speed network connec-tions to link high performance computers and largescale data stores distributed across the United States.While the TeraGrid has been exploited within the as-tronomy and physics communities, it has been littleused by the computational linguistics community.The SIDGrid portal to the TeraGrid allows large-scale experimentation by providing access to large-scale distributed processing clusters to enable par-allel processing on very high capacity servers.
TheSIDGrid portal to the TeraGrid allows the user tospecify a set of files in the repository and a programor programs to run on them on the Grid-based re-sources.
Once a program is installed on the Grid,the processing can be distributed automatically todifferent TeraGrid nodes.
Software supports arbi-trarily complex workflow specifications, but the cur-rent SIDGrid interface provides simple support forhigh degrees of data-parallel processing, as well as agraphical display indicating the progress of the dis-tributed program execution, as shown in Figure 4.The results are then reintegrated with the originalexperiments in the on-line repository.
Currently in-stalled programs support distributed acoustic analy-sis using Praat, statistical analysis using R, and ma-trix computations using Matlab and Octave.2.5 Software AvailabilityThe client software is freely available.
Ac-cess to the public portion of the repositoryis possible through the project website athttps://sidgrid.ci.uchicago.edu;full access to the repository to create new experi-ments may also be requested there.3 Course Setting and ActivitiesWe explore the use of this framework in a coursewhich focuses on a subarea of Computational Lin-guistics, specifically discourse and dialogue, tar-geted at graduate students interested in research inthis area.
This topic is the subject of research notonly in computational speech and language process-ing, but also in linguistics, psychology, sociology,anthropology, and philosophy.
Research in this areadraws on a growing, large-scale collection of textand multi-modal interaction data that often relies on108Figure 3: Screenshot of the archive download interface, with thumbnails of available video and download and analysiscontrols.Figure 4: Progress of execution of programs on TeraGrid.

However, prior offerings of thiscourse through the Computer Science Departmenthad attracted primarily Computer Science gradu-ate students, even though readings for the coursespanned the range of related fields.
In collabora-tion with researchers in co-verbal gesture in the Psy-chology department, we hoped to increase the attrac-tion and accessibility of the course material and ex-ercises to a more diverse student population.
Af-ter advertising the course to a broader populationthrough the Linguistics Department mailing list, em-phasizing the use of computational tools but lack ofrequirements for previous programming experience,the resulting class included members of the Linguis-tics, Slavic Studies, Psychology, and Computer Sci-ence Departments, about half of whom had someprior programming experience, but few were expert.3.1 Hands-on ExercisesCurrently, we have only included a small number ofsoftware tools as proof-of-concept and to enable par-ticular course exercises in discourse and dialogue.This first set of exercises explores three main prob-lems in this area: topic segmentation, dialogue acttagging, and turn-taking.The topic segmentation exercise investigates theimpact of segment granularity and automatic speechrecognition errors on topic segmentation of conver-sational speech.
The data is drawn from the Cross-Language Speech Retrieval Track of the Cross-language Evaluation Forum (CLEF CL-SR) (Pecinaet al, 2007) collection.
This collection includes au-tomatic transcriptions of interviews from an oral his-tory project, accompanied by manual segmentationcreated as part of the MALACH project (Franz et al,2003).
The exercise employs the web-based portalto the TeraGrid to perform segmentation of multipleinterviews in parallel on the Grid, followed by eval-uation in parallel.
We perform segmentation usingLCSeg (Galley et al, 2003) and evaluate using thepk and WindowDiff metrics.
Students identify thebest segmentation parameters for these interviewsand perform error analysis to assess the effect ofASR errors.The dialogue act tagging exercise involves bothannotation and analysis components.
The studentsare asked to download and annotate a small portionof a conversation from the AMI corpus (Carletta etal., 2005) with dialogue act tags.
The AMI cor-pus of multiparty meetings includes recorded video,recorded audio, aligned manual transcriptions, andmanually annotated head and hand gesture.
Stu-dents annotate from text alone, with audio, withvideo, and with all modalities.
Local ?transforma-tions?, programs or scripts associated with the an-notation client, can also provide prosodic analysisof features such as pitch and intensity.
Studentsare asked to assess the influence of different fea-tures on their annotation process and to compare toa gold standard annotation which is later provided.The automatic analysis phase is performed on theweb-based portal to assess the impact of differentfeature sets on automatic tagging.
The tagging isdone in the Feature Latent Semantic Analysis frame-work (Serafin and Di Eugenio, 2004), augmentedwith additional prosodic and multi-modal featuresdrawn from the annotation.
Since this analysis re-quires Singular Value Decomposition of the poten-tially large Feature-by-Dialogue-Act matrices, it isoften impractical to execute on single personal oreven departmental servers.
Furthermore, feature ex-traction, such as pitch tracking, of the full conver-sation can itself strain the computational resourcesavailable to students.
Grid-based processing over-comes both of these problems.Exercises on turn-taking follow similar patterns.An initial phase requires annotation and assessmentexercises by the students in the ELAN-based clienttool and downloaded from the web-based repository.Subsequent phases of the exercises include applica-tion and investigation of automatic techniques us-ing the web-based environment and computationalresources of the TeraGrid.
Clearly, many other exer-cises could be framed within this general paradigm,and we plan to extend the options available to stu-dents as our interests and available software and datasets permit.4 Impact on Interdisciplinary InstructionWe designed these hands-on exercises to allow stu-dents to investigate important problems in discourseand dialogue through exploration of the data andapplication of automatic techniques to recognizethese phenomena.
We aimed in addition to exploit110the cyberinfrastructure framework to achieve threemain goals: lower barriers of entry to use of com-putational tools by students with little prior pro-gramming experience, enable students with greatercomputational skills to expand the scale and scopeof their experiments, and to support collaborativeprojects and a broader, interdisciplinary perspectiveon research in discourse and dialogue.4.1 Enabling All UsersA key goal in employing this architecture was to en-able students with little or no programming expe-rience to exploit advanced computational tools andtechniques.
The integration of so-called ?transfor-mations?, actually arbitrary program applications, inboth the annotation client and the web-based portalto the TeraGrid, supports this goal.
In both cases,drop-down menus to select programs and text- andcheck-boxes to specify parameters provide graphi-cal user interfaces to what can otherwise be complexcommand-line specifications.
In particular, the web-based portal removes requirements for local instal-lation of software, shielding the user from problemsdue to complex installations, variations in platformsand operating systems, and abstruse command-linesyntax.
In addition, the web-based archive providessimple mechanisms to browse and download a rangeof data sources.
The students all found the archive,download, and transformation mechanisms easy touse, regardless of prior programming experience.
Itis important to remember that the goal of this envi-ronment is not to replace existing software systemsfor Natural Language Processing, such the NaturalLanguage Toolkit (NLTK) (Bird and Loper, 2004),but rather to provide a simpler interface to such soft-ware tools and to support their application to poten-tially large data sets, irrespective of the processingpower of the individual user?
system.4.2 Enabling Large-Scale ExperimentationA second goal is to enable larger-scale experimenta-tion by both expert and non-expert users.
The use ofthe web-based portal to the TeraGrid provides suchopportunities.
The portal provides access to highlydistributed parallel processing capabilities.
For ex-ample, in the case of the segmentation of the oralhistory interviews above, the user can select severalinterviews, say 60, to segment by checking the as-sociated check-boxes in the interface.
The portalsoftware will automatically identify available pro-cessing nodes and distribute the segmentation jobsfor the corresponding interviews to each of the avail-able nodes to be executed in parallel.
Not only arethere many processing nodes, but these nodes are ofvery high capacity in terms of CPU speed, numberof CPUs, and available memory.The multigigabyte data files associated with thegrowing number of multi-modal discourse and dia-logue corpora, such as the AMI and ICSI MeetingRecorder collections, make such processing powerhighly desirable.
For example, pitch tracking forsuch corpora is beyond the memory limitations ofany single machine in the department, while suchtasks are quickly processed on the powerful Tera-Grid machines.Expert users are also granted privileges to uploadtheir own user-defined programs to be executed onthe Grid.
Finally, web services also enable execu-tion of arbitrary read-only queries on the underly-ing database of annotations, media files, and time-series data through standard Structure Query Lan-guage (SQL) calls.
All these capabilities enhancethe scope of problems that more skilled program-mers can employ in the study of discourse and dia-logue phenomena.4.3 Interdisciplinary Collaboration andPerspectivesThe web-based archive in the SIDGrid frameworkalso provides support for group distributed collab-orative projects.
The archive provides a Unix-stylepermission structure that allows data sharing withingroups.
The process of project creation, annota-tion, and experimentation maintains a version his-tory.
Uploads of new annotations create new ver-sions; older versions are not deleted or overwritten.Experimental runs are also archived, providing anexperiment history and shared access to intermedi-ate and final results.
Script and software versionsare also maintained.
While the version control is notnearly as sophisticated as that provided by GForgeor Subversion, this simple model requires no spe-cial training and facilitates flexible, web-based dis-tributed access and collaboration.Finally, the interleaving of annotation and auto-mated experimented permitted by this integrated ar-111chitecture provides the students with additional in-sight into different aspects of research on discourseand dialogue.
Students from linguistics and psy-chology gain greater experience in automatic analy-sis and recognition of discourse phenomena, whilemore computationally oriented students develop agreater appreciation of the challenges of annotationand theoretical issues in analysis of dialogue data.5 Challenges and CostsThe capabilities and opportunities for study of com-putational approaches to discourse and dialogue af-forded within the SIDGrid framework do requiresome significant investment of time and effort.
In-corporating new data sets and software packagesrequires programming expertise.
The frameworkcan, in principle, incorporate arbitrary data types:media, physiological measures, manual and auto-matic annotations, and even motion tracking.
Thedata must be converted into the ELAN .eaf for-mat to be deployed effectively by the annotationclient and interpreted correctly by the archive?s un-derlying database.
Converters have been createdfor several established formats2, such as Annota-tion Graphs (Bird and Liberman, 2001), ANVIL(Kipp, 2001), and EXMARaLDA(Schmidt, 2004),and projects are underway to improve interoperabil-ity between formats.
However, new formats such asthe CLEF Cross-language Speech Retrieval SGMLformat and NITE XML(Carletta et al, 2003) formatfor the AMI data used here, required the implemen-tation of software to convert the source format to onesuitable for use by SIDGrid.Incorporating new Grid-based ?transformation?programs can also range in required effort.
For self-contained programs in supported frameworks - cur-rently, Perl, Python, Praat, and Octave - adding anew program requires only a simple browser-basedupload.
Compiled programs, such as LCSeg here,must be compatible with the operating systems and64-bit architecture on the Grid servers, often requir-ing recompilation and occasionally addition of li-braries to existing Grid installations.
Finally, soft-ware with licensing restrictions can only run on alocal cluster rather than on the full TeraGrid.
Thus,public domain programs and systems that rely on2www.multimodal-annotation.orgsuch are preferred; for example, Octave-based pro-grams are preferred to Matlab-based ones.Finally, one must remember that the SIDGridframework is itself an ongoing research project.
Itprovides many opportunities to enhance interdisci-plinary instruction in Computational Linguistics, es-pecially in areas involving multi-modal data.
How-ever, the functionality is still under active develop-ment, and current system users are beta-testers.
Theuse of the system, both in coursework and in re-search, has driven improvements and expansions inservice.6 Conclusions and Future DirectionsWe have explored the use of the SIDGrid frameworkfor annotation, archiving, and analysis of multi-modal data to enhance hands-on activities in thestudy of discourse and dialogue in a highly inter-disciplinary course setting.
Our preliminary effortshave demonstrated the potential for the frameworkto lower barriers of entry for students with less pro-gramming experience to apply computational tech-niques while enabling large-scale investigation ofdiscourse and dialogue phenomena by more expertusers.
Annotation, analysis, and automatic recog-nition exercises relating to topic segmentation, di-alogue act tagging, and turn-taking give students abroader perspective on research and issues in dis-course and dialogue.
These exercises also allowstudents to contribute to class discussion and col-laborative projects drawing on their diverse disci-plinary backgrounds.
We plan to extend our currentsuite of hands-on exercises to cover other aspects ofdiscourse and dialogue, both in terms of data setsand software, including well-known toolkits such asNLTK.
We hope that this expanded framework willencourage additional interdisciplinary collaborativeprojects among students.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Susan Duncan and DavidMcNeill for their participation in this project as wellas the University of Chicago Academic TechnologyInnovation program.
