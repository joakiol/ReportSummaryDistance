Relatedlanguages hare a ntuch wider range of linguistic itff'ornuttio;tthan typically assunwd in stamlard mttltilingttal gramtmtratwhitectures.
Taking grammatical relatedness eriously, weare particularly interested in designing lhtguistically motivatedgrammatical resottrces Jbr Slavic languages to be used itzapplied and theoretical computational linguistics, ht order togain the pelwpective of a language-family oriented gramntardesigtl, we consider {ttt arrtly of systematic relations that canhold between syntactical units.
While the categorisation ofprimitive linguistic entities tends to be language-specilic oreven constrttction-.~pecific, the relations holding between themallow viii'lofts degrees of absltztction.
On the basis of Slavic&tta, we show how a domain ontology conceptualising molpho-syntaclic "buildiltg blocks" can serve as a basis r~" a sharedgrotlt;nar of Slavic.IntroductionIn applied computational linguistics, the need fordeveloping and utilising operational notions ofshared grammars tems fi'om multilingual grammarengineering.
If considerable portions of existinggrammars can be reused for the specification ot7 newgrammars, development eftbrts can be greatly re-duced.
A shared grammar also facilitates the diffi-cult task of lnaintaining consistency within andacross the individual parallel grammars.
In machinetranslation, the specification of a shared grammarcan furthermore be exploited for simplifying thetransfer process.Without much ado, computational linguists engagedin multilingual grammar development have alwaystried to reduce their labour by importing existinggrammar components in a simple "copy-paste-modify" fashion.
But there were also a number ofsystematic attempts to create and describe sharedgrammars that are convincingly documented inpublications.
\[Kam88\] demonstrates the concept fora relatively restricted domain, the grammaticaldescription of simple nominal expressions in fivelanguages.
\[BOP88\] were able to exploit the gram-matical overlap of two Slavic languages, for thedesign of a lean transfer process in Russian toCzech machine translation.
In multilingual applica-tion development within Microsoft research, gram-mar sharing has extensively been exploited -\[Pin96\], \[GLPR97\].However, all these approaches are rather opportun-istic in the sense that existing grammatical descrip-tions based on existing grammar models were ex-plored.
We went a step further and started grammardesign with a notion of a shared grammar for afamily of related languages.
Pursuing the goal ofdesigning linguistically motivated grammaticalresources for Slavic languages to be used in com-putational linguistics, one is inevitably confrontedwith primary problems temming ti'om the t'act thatdifferent linguistic theories cut up grammars inquite different ways, and grammar formalisms differin their degree of granularity.
It cannot be expected,therefore, that the minimal differences between twolanguages or their shared elements form easilyidentifiable units in the available language-specificgrammars.
Therefore, an ontology conceptualisingmorphosyntactic "building blocks" would offer asolid basis for a shared grammar of Slavic in thesense of \[ASU99\].
Our use of the term ontology isfairly pragmatic, namely, as representing a formalshared conceptualisation f a particular domain ofinterest.
It describes concepts relevant for the do-main, their relationships, as well as "axioms" aboutthese concepts and relationships.
Note that such apragmatic approach does not presuppose any gen-eral all-encompassing ontology of language butrather "mini-ontologies" conceptualising the se-lected domain from various perspectives in a con-sistent way.
The domain of interest in this project isthe grammatical knowledge on Slavic morphosyn-tax contained in linguistic theories and linguisticdescriptions.
While the categorisation of primitivelinguistic entities lends to be language-specific oreven construction-specific, the relations holdingbetween them allow various degrees of abstraction.In order to gain the perspective of language-familyoriented grammar design, we will consider the arrayof .s3,stematic relations that can hold between syn-tactically significant items.Systematic relationsSystematic relations motivate shared patterns ofvariation cross-linguistically as well as across con-structions.
In a constraint-based theory like HPSG,where the grammatical properties of linguistic enti-ties are typically revealed in complex taxonomies,nothing in the formal apparatus would actuallyexclude the possibility to organise also the relationsholding in syntactic onstructions in a type hierar-chy.
So, the type subsumption could be interpretedas modelling a continuum from general - and pre-sumably universal - systematic relations to moreand still more specific instances of these relationsresulting fi'om admissible cross-classifications.
I InI The two types of edges connecting types in otu g,'aphicalrepresentation f hierarchies - 'square' and 'direct' - are signifi-cant.
The former indicate possible conjunction of types, and thusintroduce various dimensions of multiple inhe,'itance.
The latterindicate disjunction of types within the respective dimension ofclassification.98our view, two orthogonal types of systematic rela-tions have to be distinguished: syntagmatics andalignment, since they appear to be universally rele-vant for the well-for|nedlmss of utterances in anylanguage (Hierarchy I).

The directionality accounts for situationswhere, e.g., Ihe head either li)llows the dependent orprecedes it.
In turn, the i~eriphcry of a syntacticallydetermined omain can be left or right.St ructura l  syntagmat icsThe structural syutagn|atic relations between twosyntactic units is classified along two primary di-mensions which we call centHcity and taxis(Hierarchy 3).

The endo-centricity of a strt,ctural syntagmatic relation(between, e.g., ~ and \[~) presuptmses that one of thesyntactic items involved in this relation (e.g., c0plays a pron|inent role.
In contrast, the exocenlricityof a structural syntag,natic relation presupl)oses noassun+|ptions in this respect, hence, it can be viewedas the unmarked member of the centricity opposi-tion.

But there is noconsensus -- often even within the same linguistictheory - on the structural interpretation of theexocentric relations.
So, additional factors are usu-ally taken into consideration as st, pporting the in-+,'eduction of particular conventions.
The latter,however, arc not always linguistically motiwtted,29tile choice is sometimes arbitrary and often due totheory-sl~ecific technical reasons.Combinator ia l  syntagmat icsThe combinatorial dimension in tile proposed tax-onomy (Hierarchy 5) largely corresponds, in ourunderstanding, to what \[S&L95\] regard as mor-phological signalling of direct syntactic relations.syntagmaticsIcombinatorial.
- - --  .
.juxtaposition co-variation governmentHicrm'chy  5: Combinator ia l  synt~mat icsTile combinatorial syntagmatic relation of juxtapo-sition presupposes no overt morphological indica-tion.
As to governmettt, i  is traditionally under-stood as the determination by one element of theinflectional form of the other, i.e.
form government.Its classical instance is, of course, case government.In \[Cann93\] (p. 51) these morpllosyntactic relationis formulated for some construction involving y and(5 ill tile following way: y governs (5 if (i) varying theinflectional l'orm of (5 while keeping T constant leadsto ungrammaticality, and (ii) varying the form o f tand keeping 8 constant makes no difference togrammaticality.
The systematic co-variatioll o1'linguistic forms is typically rcalised as feature con-gruity, i.e.
compatibility of values of identicalgrammatical categories of syntactically colnbinedlinguistic items.
Ill our view, two general co-variation types must be distinguished (cf.
Hierarchy6), namely, asymmetric and symmetric co-variation,with only the former actually corresponding to thetraditional directional concept of agreement, e.g.,\[Cor98\].Cc-vatiatiorlasymmetric symmetrical 1~1 ('d ~It__~ t__ Jllierarchy 6: Morphosyntaclic co-variationAs the term suggests, the asymmetry of co-variationpresupposes a controller-target conl'iguration.
Thisis to be contrasted with the synunetry of co-variation which is not interpretable in these terms.Symmetric o-variation, in essence, would presumeredundancy as if both co-varying syntactic itemswere controllers and targets at the same time.Endocentric hypotaxis (selection)The endocentric hypotaxis corresponds to the tradi-tional notion of selection.
Even though not directlyobservable, it underlies specific morphosyntacticrealities interpreted in Hierarchy 7 as resulting froma cross-classification with the combinatorial syn-tagmatic relation types.The traditional notion of subcategorisation call thusbe viewed as a selection that is realised via govern-mont.
Two general oplions are usually availableacross languages lbr externalising the governedselection (i.e.
subcategorisation) of nominal catego-ries in actual syntactic onstructions.syntagmaticscombinatorial structuralco-variatien centricity taxisasymmetric symmemc juxtaposition govemmem ot,ao exo nypo L)araiseleclion\[ agreement I \[matching marking SL~bcalogonsatloncress-referencing relational caseobject eliticisationHierarchy 7: SelectionA typical definition of Ihe firsl one call be found in\[Blake94\]: "Case in its most een|ral manifestation isa system of marking dependent nouns for the typeof relationship they bear to their beads".
The rela-tional case explicating case government stands inopposition to tile so-called concordial case ob-served in ease-governed modification environmentsand presented in Hierarchy 8.
The second option toexternalise subcatcgorisation f nominal categoriesis the cross-referencing the syntactic function of thedependent at the head.
It is actually confined tocertain core grammatical relations and typicallyamounts to some kind of pronominal representationof these grammatical relations at tile head.
As\[Blake94\] observes, the cross-referencing pronomi-nal elements erve as an alternative to case ill sig-nalling grammatical relations.
In Slavic, there aretwo candidales for the second /ype of externalisinga governed selection.
On tile ()he hand, lh0 verbinl\]cction can possibly be interpreted as cross-referencing the sub.icct fnnetion, especially in Bul-garian where no relational case is realised on thedependent.
On the other band, pronominal eliticscan cross-reference the direct and the indirect objectin Bulgarian verb complex, cf.
\[Avg97a\], as well asthe possessor relation in Bulgarian noun phrases, cf.\[Avg97b\].
Therefore, the systematic relation ofobject cliticisation can be viewed as a more specificinstance of cross-referencing.
In general, a nominalcategory representing a grammatical relation that iscross-referenced at the head selecting this nominalcategory need not be overtly realised.
So, the cross-referenced noun phrase controlling the agreementcan typically be omitted.In our view, the systematic relation of marking(Hierarchy 7) is an instance of juxtaposed selection,i.e.
all endocentrie hypotaxis that is realised viajuxtaposition.
We promote a faMy extensive under-standing of this syntactic relation as involving vari-ous functional categories, including auxiliaries,particles, determiners, prepositions, conjunctions,etc.
The notion of morphosyntactic marking is in-troduced in \[Avg97a\] for syntagmatic relations30holding in Bulgarian analyiic verb lbrms betweenthe main verb as a syntactic (and semantic) headand the possibly nlultiplc auxiliary verbs ;is nlai+kersspecifying it.
The agreement between the verb andits subject or conlplcmcnt is interpreted in our tax-onotny as a selection real\]seal via asymmetric o-variation (agreement 1).
It typically occurs in con\]-bination with the relation of subcatcgorisation (of.Table 1) which in languages mnploying relationalcase is realiscd as case assignment, while it\] thosecn\]l+~loying cross-reforencing ;is a syntactic functionidentification.ent l iy  :iIi(?ltll \]INDliX ~\]ii ,Nt,+xl,;';','&Ic,,+,+ I++lINI)I+X\[IIIlma ',wa,vor tzp I i II:AI)ICASE \ [ \ ]  I \[NI)EX \[1~ j........ ~B\]INI)F:X('oFuhtINH NtIMItER\[I\]\]?

Itsmost typical instance can be found where there iscompatibility in person, number or gender between(possibly multiple) auxiliaries and a main verb.Matching usually co-occut's with a 1nat+king rchition(cf.
Table 2) which, as shown in Hierarchy 7, isinterpreted its a juxlaposcd selection.Exocent r i c  hypotax is  (modi f icat ion)The exoccntric hypotaxis corresponds to the mtdi-tional notion of modification.

The asymmetric co-variation real\]singa modification relation can be called concord, butlet us refer to it - for the sake of sitnplicity - asctgreement 2.
In the majority of Slavic languages,but obviously not in Bulgarian, this relation occursin combination with concordial case (of.
Table 3).Note that in our approach the treat+nun+ of nominalapposition would be parallel to that of the adjective-noun relations.syntaomaticscombinatorial structuralcentricity co-vanartonasyRlll\]olec symmemc juxtaposition govemelenz endotaXiSexo nypo paral~odif~calionagreement 2 simile uxlaposed modificationtion governed modification \]tconcomt(case) adjunction secondary predicalion concord@ casepredicative case adjunctionI licrarchy 8: ModificationThe main difference between tl~e agt'eement 1(Hierarchy 7) and the agreement 2 (or concord)discussed here amounts to tile fact that these co-variation relations exhibit different ccntricity.Cross-classifying cxoccntric hypotaxis with sym-metric co-vat\]alien results in what cat+ be calledsimile and is typically observed in comparative31constructions, provided appropriate categories areavailable.
This systematic relation differs fl'om thatof parallelism (distinguished in Hierarehy 10) inbeing hypotactic in nature, and thus, an actual in-stance of modification.
Similarly to the asymmetricagreement 2 (concord), tim simile relation co-occurswith concordial case, cf.
ex.

whether we are confi'onted with a com-plement or a free adjt, nc t -  narrows down in ourapproach to a fluctuation between adjunction(juxtaposed modification - Hierarchy 8) and sub-categorisation (governed selection - Hierarchy 7),with the crucial point being merely a different ccn-tricity interpretation.
Also the secondaly predica-tion (referring, typically, to the relation holdingbetween a verb and a secondary controlled predica-tive) is a subtype of juxtaposed modification, withthe predicative case adjunction as a more specificinstance.
As to the relation holding between thesecondary predicative and the subject or the object,it is an instance o1' control and presupposes co-reference.
The latter two concepts realise an endo-ccntric parataxis and are introduced in Hierarchy 9.Endocentric parataxisIn the endoccntric parataxis there is a prominentitem but no subordination relation.
This allows us tomodel concepts like co-reference, correlation, co-marking (illustrated by ex.
6) and control as natu-rally resulting from a cross-classification with thecombinatorial syntagmatic relation types.If an endocentric parataxis is revealed by an asym-metric co-variation, this results in co-reference.
Thissystematic relation is tbund in relativisation (i.e.between a nominal category and the relative pro-noun introducing a relative clause that modifies thisnominal category), in resumption (i.e.
between anominal category and the pronominal element re-suming it in a different syntactic domain), and inbinding (i.e.
between a pronoun and its antecedent).When, however, an endocentric parataxis is re-vealed in a symmetric o-variation, we can speak ofcorrelation.
But in both instances of co-variation,we arc confronted with paMng indices (or restrictedparameters) el' referential objects.
What we proposeto distinguish as co-marking corresponds to endo-centrie parataxis that is realised via juxtaposition.So, it contrasts with the systematic relation ofmarking (presented in Hierarchy 7) only along thetaxis dimension of structural syntagmatics inasmuchas there is no subordination relation between theinvolved syntactic items.
As to the systematic rela-tion of syntactic ontrol, it is registered in our tax-enemy as an cndocentrie parataxis resulting in afor,n government.
In Bulgarian, it co-occurs withco-reference - cx.

It is an exoeentricparataxis that is realised via government, with aspecial requirement that all involved syntactic itemshave the same governor.
In other words, these itemsare typically dependcnts of the same syntactic head.What we call agreement 3 (or accord) correspondsto an exocentric paralaxis that is rcaliscd via asym-metric co-variation.
It regularly presupposes a co-32dependence relation (of.
Table 4), and its mosttypical instance can be fotmd as a COlnpatibility innumber or gender between the subject and thepredicative in copular constructions.
