One requirement for mostNLP systems is the ability to accurately recognizebiological entity terms in free text and the ability tomap these terms to corresponding records in data-bases.
Such task is called biological named entitytagging.
In this paper, we present a system thatautomatically constructs a protein entity dictionary,which contains gene or protein names associated withUniProt identifiers using online resources.
The systemcan run periodically to always keep up-to-date withthese online resources.
Using online resources thatwere available on Dec. 25, 2004, we obtained4,046,733 terms for 1,640,082 entities.
The dictionarycan be accessed from the following website:http://biocreative.ifsm.umbc.edu/biothesaurus/.Contact: hfliu@umbc.edu1 IntroductionWith the use of computers in storing the explosiveamount of biological information, natural languageprocessing (NLP) approaches have been explored tomake the task of managing information recorded infree text more feasible [1, 2].
One requirement forNLP is the ability to accurately recognize terms thatrepresent biological entities in free text.
Another re-quirement is the ability to associate these terms withcorresponding biological entities (i.e., records in bio-logical databases) in order to be used by other auto-mated systems for literature mining.
Such task iscalled biological entity tagging.
Biological entitytagging is not a trivial task because of several charac-teristics associated with biological entity names,namely: synonymy (i.e., different terms refer to thesame entity), ambiguity (i.e., one term is associatedwith different entities), and coverage (i.e., entityterms or entities are not present in databases orknowledge bases).Methods for biological entity tagging can be catego-rized into two types: one is to use a dictionary and amapping method [3-5], and the other is to markupterms in the text according to contextual cues, spe-cific verbs, or machine learning  [6-10].
The per-formance of biological entity tagging systems usingdictionaries depends on the coverage of the diction-ary as well as mapping methods that can handle syn-onymous or ambiguous terms.
Strictly speaking,tagging systems that do not use dictionaries are notbiological entity tagging but biological term tagging,since tagged terms in text are not associated withspecific biological entities stored in databases.
It re-quires an additional step to map terms mentioned inthe text to records in biological databases in order tobe automatically integrated with other system or da-tabases.
Due to the dynamic nature associated withthe molecular biology domain, it is critical to have acomprehensive biological entity dictionary that isalways up-to-date.In this paper, we present a system that constructs alarge protein entity dictionary, BioThesaurus, usingonline resources.
Terms in the dictionary are thencurated based on high ambiguous terms to flag non-sensical terms (e.g., Novel protein) and are also cu-rated based on the semantic categories acquired fromthe UMLS to flag descriptive terms that associatewith other semantic types other than gene or proteins(e.g., terms that refer to species, cells or other smallmolecules).
In the following, we first provide back-ground and related work on dictionary constructionusing online resources.
We then present our methodon constructing the dictionary.2 ResourcesThe system utilizes several large size biological data-bases including three NCBI databases (GenPept [11],RefSeq [12], and Entrez GENE [13]), PSD databasefrom Protein Information Resources (PIR) [14], and17UniProt [15].
Additionally, several model organismdatabases or nomenclature databases were used.
Cor-respondences among records from these databasesare identified using the rich cross-reference informa-tion provided by the iProClass database of PIR [14].The following provides a brief description of each ofthe database.PIR Resources ?
There are three databases in PIR:the Protein Sequence Database (PSD), iProClass, andPIR-NREF.
PSD database includes functionally an-notated protein sequences.
The iProClass database isa central point for exploration of protein information,which provides summary descriptions of protein fam-ily, function and structure for all protein sequencesfrom PIR, Swiss-Prot, and TrEMBL (now UniProt).Additionally, it links to over 70 biological databasesin the world.
The PIR-NREF database is a compre-hensive database for sequence searching and proteinidentification.
It contains non-redundant protein se-quences from PSD, Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, RefSeq,GenPept, and PDB.Figure 1: The overall architecture of the systemUniProt ?
UniProt provides a central repository ofprotein sequence and annotation created by joiningSwiss-Prot, TrEMBL, and PSD.
There are threeknowledge components in UniProt: Swissprot,TrEMBL, and UniRef.
Swissprot contains manually-annotated records with information extracted fromliterature and curator-evaluated computational analy-sis.
TrEMBL consists of computationally analyzedrecords that await full manual annotation.
The Uni-Prot Non-redundant Reference (UniRef) databasescombine closely related sequences into a single re-cord where similar sequences are grouped together.Three UniRef tables UniRef100, UniRef90 and Uni-Ref50) are available for download: UniRef100 com-bines identical sequences and sub-fragments into asingle UniRef entry; and UniRef90 and UniRef50 arebuilt by clustering UniRef100 sequences into clustersbased on the CD-HIT algorithm [16] such that eachcluster is composed of sequences that have at least90% or 50% sequence similarity, respectively, to therepresentative sequence.NCBI resources ?
three data sources from NCBIwere used in this study: GenPept, RefSeq, and EntrezGENE.
GenPept entries are those translated from theGenBanknucleotide sequence database.
RefSeq is acomprehensive, integrated, non-redundant set of se-quences, including genomic DNA, transcript (RNA),and protein products, for major research organisms.Entrez GENE provides a unified query environmentfor genes defined by sequence and/or in NCBI's MapViewer.
It records gene names, symbols, and manyother attributes associated with genes and the prod-ucts they encode.The UMLS ?
the Unified Medical Language System(UMLS) has been developed and maintained by Na-tional Library of Medicine (NLM) [17].
It containsthree knowledge sources: the Metathesaurus(META), the SPECIALIST lexicon, and the Seman-tic Network.
The META provides a uniform, inte-grated platform for over 60 biomedical vocabulariesand classifications, and group different names for thesame concept.
The SPECIALIST lexicon containssyntactic information for many terms, componentwords, and English words, including verbs, which donot appear in the META.
The Semantic Network con-tains information about the types or categories (e.g.,?Disease or Syndrome?, ?Virus?)
to which all METAconcepts have been assigned.Other molecular biology databases - We also in-cluded several model organism databases or nomen-clature databases in the construction of thedictionary, i.e., mouse - Mouse Genome Database(MGD) [18],  fly - FlyBase [19], yeast - Saccharomy-ces Genome Database (SGD) [20], rat ?
Rat GenomeDatabase (RGD) [21], worm ?
WormBase [22], Hu-man Nomenclature Database (HUGO) [23], OnlineMendelian Inheritance in Man  (OMIM) [24], andEnzyme Nomenclature Database (ECNUM) [25, 26].3 System Description and ResultsThe system was developed using PERL and thePERL module Net::FTP.
Figure 1 depicts the overallarchitecture.
It automatically gathers fields that con-tain annotation information from PSD, RefSeq,Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, GenBank, Entrez GENE, MGI,RGD, HUGO, ENCUM, FlyBase, and WormBase foreach iProClass record from the distribution website18Figure 2: Screenshot of retrieving il2 from BioThesaurusof each resource.
Annotations extracted from eachresource were then processed to extract terms whereeach term is associated with one or more UniProtunique identifiers and comprised the raw dictionaryfor BioThesaurus.
The raw dictionary was computa-tionally curated using the UMLS to flag the UMLSsemantic types and remove several high frequentnonsensical terms.
There were a total of 1,677,162iProclass records in the PIR release 59 (released onDec 25 2004).
From it, we obtained 4,046,733 termsfor 1,640,082 entities.
Note that about 27,000 recordshave no terms in the dictionary mostly because theyare new sequences and have not been annotated andlinked to other resources or terms associated withthem are nonsensical.
The dictionary can be searchedthrough the following URL:http://biocreative.ifsm.umbc.edu/biothesaurus/Biothesaurus.html.Figure 2 shows a screenshot when retrieving entitiesassociated with term il2.
It indicates that there aretotally 71 entities in UniProt that il2 represents whenignoring textual variants.
The first column of the ta-ble is UniProt ID.
The primary name is shown in thesecond column, the family classifications availablefrom iProClass are shown in the following severalcolumns, the taxonomy information is shown in thenext.
The popularity of the term (i.e., the number ofdatabases that contain the term or its variants) isshown next.
And the last column shows the links tothe records from which the system extracted theterms.4 Discussion and ConclusionWe demonstrated here a system which generates aprotein entity dictionary dynamically using onlineresources.
The dictionary can be used by biologicalentity tagging systems to map entity terms mentionedin the text to specific records in UniProt.AcknowledgementsThe project was supported by IIS-0430743 from theNational Science Foundation.Reference1.
