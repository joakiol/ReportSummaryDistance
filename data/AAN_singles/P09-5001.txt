Today, more and more Chinese in-formation are available in electronic form andover the internet.
Computer processing of Chi-nese text requires the understanding of both thelanguage itself and the technology to handlethem.
This tutorial is targeted for both Chineselinguists who are interested in computationallinguistics and computer scientists who are inter-ested in research on processing Chinese.2 Content OverviewThis tutorial consists of two parts.
The first partoverviews the grammar of the Chinese languagefrom a language processing perspective based onnaturally occurring data.
The second part over-views Chinese specific processing issues andcorresponding computational technologies.The grammar introduced is a descriptivegrammar of general-purpose, present-day stan-dard Mandarin Chinese, which is fast becomingan internationally spoken language.
Real exam-ples of actual language use will be illustratedbased on a data driven and corpus based ap-proach so that its links to computational linguis-tic approaches for computer processing are natu-rally bridged in.
A number of important ChineseNLP resources are also presented.
On the tech-nology side, the tutorial mainly covers Chineseword segmentation and Part-of-Speech tagging.Word segmentation problem has to deal withsome Chinese language unique problems such asunknown word detection and named entity rec-ognition which are the emphasis of this tutorial.3 Tutorial OutlinePart 1: Highlights of Chinese Grammar for NLP1.1 Preliminaries: Orthography and writingconventions1.2 Basic unit of processing: word or character?a.
