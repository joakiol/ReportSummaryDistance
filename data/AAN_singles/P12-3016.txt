Apossible solution is to exploit comparablecorpora (non-parallel bi- or multi-lingual textresources) which are much more widelyavailable than parallel translation data.
Ourpresented toolkit deals with parallel contentextraction from comparable corpora.
It consistsof tools bundled in two workflows: (1)alignment of comparable documents andextraction of parallel sentences and (2)extraction and bilingual mapping of terms andnamed entities.
The toolkit pairs similarbilingual comparable documents and extractsparallel sentences and bilingual terminologicaland named entity dictionaries from comparablecorpora.
This demonstration focuses on theEnglish, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Romanianlanguages.IntroductionIn recent decades, data-driven approaches havesignificantly advanced the development ofmachine translation (MT).
However, lack ofsufficient bilingual linguistic resources for manylanguages and domains is still one of the majorobstacles for further advancement of automatedtranslation.
At the same time, comparable corpora,i.e., non-parallel bi- or multilingual text resourcessuch as daily news articles and large knowledgebases like Wikipedia, are much more widelyavailable than parallel translation data.While methods for the use of parallel corpora inmachine translation are well studied (Koehn,2010), similar techniques for comparable corporahave not been thoroughly worked out.
Only thelatest research has shown that language pairs anddomains with little parallel data can benefit fromthe exploitation of comparable corpora (Munteanuand Marcu, 2005; Lu et al, 2010; Smith et al,2010; Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009 and 2011).In this paper we present the ACCURATtoolkit1 - a collection of tools that are capable ofanalysing comparable corpora and extractingparallel data which can be used to improve theperformance of statistical and rule/example-basedMT systems.Although the toolkit may be used for paralleldata acquisition for open (broad) domain systems,it will be most beneficial for under-resourcedlanguages or specific domains which are notcovered by available parallel resources.The ACCURAT toolkit produces:?
comparable document pairs withcomparability scores, allowing to estimatethe overall comparability of corpora;?
parallel sentences which can be used asadditional parallel data sources forstatistical translation model learning;1 http://www.accurat-project.eu/91?
terminology dictionaries ?
this type ofdata is expected to improve domain-dependent translation;?
named entity dictionaries.The demonstration showcases two general usecase scenarios defined in the toolkit: ?parallel datamining from comparable corpora?
and ?namedentity/terminology extraction and mapping fromcomparable corpora?.The next section provides a general overview ofworkflows followed by descriptions of methodsand tools integrated in the workflows.1 Overview of the WorkflowsThe toolkit?s tools are integrated within twoworkflows (visualised in Figure 1).Figure 1.
Workflows of the ACCURAT toolkit.The workflow for parallel data mining fromcomparable corpora aligns comparable corpora inthe document level (section 2.1).
This step iscrucial as the further steps are computationallyintensive.
To minimise search space, documentsare aligned with possible candidates that are likelyto contain parallel data.
Then parallel sentencepairs are extracted from the aligned comparablecorpora (section 2.2).The workflow for named entity (NE) andterminology extraction and mapping fromcomparable corpora extracts data in a dictionary-like format.
Providing a list of document pairs, theworkflow tags NEs or terms in all documents usinglanguage specific taggers (named entityrecognisers (NER) or term extractors) andperforms multi-lingual NE (section 2.3) or termmapping (section 2.4), thereby producing bilingualNE or term dictionaries.
The workflow alsoaccepts pre-processed documents, thus skippingthe tagging process.Since all tools use command line interfaces, taskautomation and workflow specification can bedone with simple console/terminal scripts.
Alltools can be run on the Windows operating system(some are also platform independent).2 Tools and MethodsThis section provides an overview of the maintools and methods in the toolkit.
A full list of toolsis described in ACCURAT D2.6.
(2011).2.1 Comparability MetricsWe define comparability by how useful a pair ofdocuments is for parallel data extraction.
Thehigher the comparability score, the more likely twodocuments contain more overlapping parallel data.The methods are developed to perform lightweightcomparability estimation that minimises searchspace of relatively large corpora (e.g., 10,000documents in each language).
There are twocomparability metric tools in the toolkit: atranslation based and a dictionary based metric.The Translation based metric (Su and Babych,2012a) uses MT APIs for document translationinto English.
Then four independent similarityfeature functions are applied to a document pair:?
Lexical feature ?
both documents are pre-processed (tokenised, lemmatised, andstop-words are filtered) and thenvectorised.
The lexical overlap score iscalculated as a cosine similarity functionover the vectors of two documents.?
Structural feature ?
the difference ofsentence counts and content word counts(equally interpolated).?
Keyword feature ?
the cosine similarityof top 20 keywords.?
NE feature ?
the cosine similarity of NEs(extracted using Stanford NER).These similarity measures are linearly combined ina final comparability score.
This is implemented bya simple weighted average strategy, in which each92type of feature is associated with a weightindicating its relative confidence or importance.The comparability scores are normalised on a scaleof 0 to 1, where a higher comparability scoreindicates a higher comparability level.The reliability of the proposed metric has beenevaluated on a gold standard of comparablecorpora for 11 language pairs (Skadi?a et al,2010).
The gold standard consists of news articles,legal documents, knowledge-base articles, usermanuals, and medical documents.
Document pairsin the gold standard were rated by human judges asbeing parallel, strongly comparable, or weaklycomparable.
The evaluation results suggest that thecomparability scores reliably reflect comparabilitylevels.
In addition, there is a strong correlationbetween human defined comparability levels andthe confidence scores derived from thecomparability metric, as the Pearson R correlationscores vary between 0.966 and 0.999, dependingon the language pair.The Dictionary based metric (Su and Babych,2012b) is a lightweight approach, which usesbilingual dictionaries to lexically map documentsfrom one language to another.
The dictionaries areautomatically generated via word alignment usingGIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) on parallel corpora.For each word in the source language, the top twotranslation candidates (based on the wordalignment probability in GIZA++) are retrieved aspossible translations into the target language.
Thismetric provides a much faster lexical translationprocess, although word-for-word lexical mappingproduces less reliable translations than MT basedtranslations.
Moreover, the lower quality of texttranslation in the dictionary based metric does notnecessarily degrade its performance in predictingcomparability levels of comparable documentpairs.
The evaluation on the gold standard shows astrong correlation (between 0.883 and 0.999)between human defined comparability levels andthe confidence scores of the metric.2.2 Parallel Sentence Extractor fromComparable CorporaPhrase-based statistical translation models areamong the most successful translation models thatcurrently exist (Callison-Burch et al, 2010).Usually, phrases are extracted from parallelcorpora by means of symmetrical word alignmentand/or by phrase generation (Koehn et al, 2003).Our toolkit exploits comparable corpora in order tofind and extract comparable sentences for SMTtraining using a tool named LEXACC (?tef?nescuet al, 2012).LEXACC requires aligned document pairs (alsom to n alignments) for sentence extraction.
It alsoallows extraction from comparable corpora as awhole; however, precision may decrease due tolarger search space.LEXACC scores sentence pairs according to fivelexical overlap and structural matching featurefunctions.
These functions are combined usinglinear interpolation with weights trained for eachlanguage pair and direction using logisticregression.
The feature functions are:?
a lexical (translation) overlap score forcontent words (nouns, verbs, adjectives,and adverbs) using GIZA++ (Gao andVogel, 2008) format dictionaries;?
a lexical (translation) overlap score forfunctional words (all except contentwords) constrained by the content wordalignment from the previous feature;?
the alignment obliqueness score, a measurethat quantifies the degree to which therelative positions of source and targetaligned words differ;?
a score indicating whether strong contentword translations are found at thebeginning and the end of each sentence inthe given pair;?
a punctuation score which indicateswhether the sentences have identicalsentence ending punctuation.For different language pairs, the relevance ofthe individual feature functions differ.
Forinstance, the locality feature is more important forthe English-Romanian pair than for the English-Greek pair.
Therefore, the weights are trained onparallel corpora (in our case - 10,000 pairs).LEXACC does not score every sentence pair inthe Cartesian product between source and targetdocument sentences.
It reduces the search spaceusing two filtering steps (?tef?nescu et al, 2012).The first step makes use of the Cross-LanguageInformation Retrieval framework and uses a searchengine to find sentences in the target corpus thatare the most probable translations of a givensentence.
In the second step (which is optional),93the resulting candidates are further filtered, andthose that do not meet minimum requirements areeliminated.To work for a certain language pair, LEXACCneeds additional resources: (i) a GIZA++-liketranslation dictionary, (ii) lists of stop-words inboth languages, and (iii) lists of word suffixes inboth languages (used for stemming).The performance of LEXACC, regardingprecision and recall, can be controlled by athreshold applied to the overall interpolatedparallelism score.
The tool has been evaluated onnews article comparable corpora.

The corpora size is given only asan indicative figure, as the amount of extractedparallel data greatly depends on the comparabilityof the corpora.2.3 Named Entity Extraction and MappingThe second workflow of the toolkit allows NE andterminology extraction and mapping.
Starting withnamed entity recognition, the toolkit features thefirst NER systems for Latvian and Lithuanian(Pinnis, 2012).
It also contains NER systems forEnglish (through an OpenNLP NER2 wrapper) andRomanian (NERA).
In order to map named entities,documents have to be tagged with NER systemsthat support MUC-7 format NE SGML tags.The toolkit contains the mapping tool NERA2.The mapper requires comparable corpora alignedin the document level as input.
NERA2 compareseach NE from the source language to each NEfrom the target language using cognate basedmethods.
It also uses a GIZA++ format statisticaldictionary to map NEs containing common nounsthat are frequent in location names.
This approachallows frequent NE mapping if the cognate basedmethod fails, therefore, allowing increasing therecall of the mapper.
Precision and recall can betuned with a confidence score threshold.2.4 Terminology MappingDuring recent years, automatic bilingual termmapping in comparable corpora has receivedgreater attention in light of the scarcity of paralleldata for under-resourced languages.
Severalmethods have been applied to this task, e.g.,contextual analysis (Rapp, 1995; Fung andMcKeown, 1997) and compositional analysis(Daille and Morin, 2008).
Symbolic, statistical, andhybrid techniques have been implemented forbilingual lexicon extraction (Morin andProchasson, 2011).Our terminology mapper is designed to mapterms extracted from comparable or parallel2 Open NLP - http://incubator.apache.org/opennlp/.94documents.
The method is language independentand can be applied if a translation equivalents tableexists for a language pair.
As input, the applicationrequires term-tagged bilingual corpora aligned inthe document level.The toolkit includes term-tagging tools forEnglish, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Romanian, butcan be easily extended for other languages if aPOS-tagger, a phrase pattern list, a stop-word list,and an inverse document frequency list (calculatedon balanced corpora) are available.The aligner maps terms based on two criteria(Pinnis et al, 2012; ?tef?nescu, 2012): (i) aGIZA++-like translation equivalents table and (ii)string similarity in terms of Levenshtein distancebetween term candidates.
For evaluation, Eurovoc(Steinberger et al, 2002) was used.

These tools are integrated inpredefined workflows that are ready for immediateuse.
The workflows provide functionality for theextraction of parallel sentences, bilingual NEdictionaries, and bilingual term dictionaries fromcomparable corpora.The methods, including comparability metrics,parallel sentence extraction and named entity/termmapping, are language independent.
However, theymay require language dependent resources, forinstance, POS-taggers, Giza++ translationdictionaries, NERs, term taggers, etc.3The ACCURAT toolkit is released under theApache 2.0 licence and is freely available fordownload after completing a registration form4.AcknowledgementsThe research within the project ACCURATleading to these results has received funding fromthe European Union Seventh FrameworkProgramme (FP7/2007-2013), grant agreement no248347.ReferencesSadaf Abdul-Rauf and Holger Schwenk.
