Proceedings of the BioNLP Workshop on Linking Natural Language Processing and Biology at HLT-NAACL 06, pages 112?113,New York City, June 2006. c?2006 Association for Computational LinguisticsRecognizing Nested Named Entities in GENIA corpusBaohua GuSchool of Computing ScienceSimon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canadabgu@cs.sfu.caAbstractNested Named Entities (nested NEs), onecontaining another, are commonly seen inbiomedical text, e.g., accounting for16.7% of all named entities in GENIAcorpus.
While many works have beendone in recognizing non-nested NEs,nested NEs have been largely neglected.In this work, we treat the task as a binaryclassification problem and solve it usingSupport Vector Machines.
For each tokenin nested NEs, we use two schemes to setits class label: labeling as the outmostentity or the inner entity.
Our preliminaryresults show that while the outmostlabeling tends to work better inrecognizing the outmost entities, the innerlabeling recognizes the inner NEs better.This result should be useful forrecognition of nested NEs.1 IntroductionNamed Entity Recognition (NER) is a key task inbiomedical text mining, as biomedical namedentities usually represent biomedical concepts ofresearch interest (e.g., protein/gene/virus, etc).Nested NEs (also called embedded NEs, orcascade NEs) exhibit an interesting phenomenon inbiomedical literature.
For example, ?humanimmuneodeficiency virus type 2 enhancer?
is aDNA domain, while ?human immunodeficiencyvirus type 2?
represents a virus.
For simplicity, wecall the former the outmost entity (if it is not insideanother entity), while the later the inner entity (itmay have another one inside).Nested NEs account for 16.7% of all entities inGENIA corpus (Kim, 2003).
Moreover, they oftenrepresent important relations between entities(Nedadic, 2004), as in the above example.However, there are few results on recognizingthem.
Many studies only consider the outmostentities, as in BioNLP/NLPBA 2004 Shared Task(Kim, 2004).In this work, we use a machine learning methodto recognize nested NEs in GENIA corpus.
Weview the task as a classification problem for eachtoken in a given sentence, and train a SVM model.We note that nested NEs make it hard to beconsidered as a multi-class problem, because atoken in nested entities has more than one classlabel.
We therefore treat it as a binary-classproblem, using one-vs-rest scheme.1.1 Related WorkOverall, our work is an application of machinelearning methods to biomedical NER.
While mostof earlier approaches rely on handcrafted rules ordictionaries, many recent works adopt machinelearning approaches, e.g, SVM (Lee, 2003), HMM(Zhou, 2004), Maximum Entropy (Lin, 2004) andCRF (Settles,2004), especially with the availabilityof annotated corpora such as GENIA, achievingstate-of-the-art performance.
We know only onework (Zhou,2004) that deals with nested NEs toimprove the overall NER performance.
However,their approach is basically rule-based and they didnot report how well the nested NEs are recognized.2 MethodologyWe use SVM-light (http://svmlight.joachims.org/)to train a binary classifier on the GENIA corpus.2.1 Data SetThe GENIA corpus (version 3.02) contains 97876named entities (35947 distinct) of 36 types, and490941 tokens (19883 distinct).
There are 16672112nested entities, containing others or nested inothers (the maximum embedded levels is four).Among all the outmost entities, 2342 are proteinand 1849 are DNA, while there are 9298 proteinsand 1452 DNAs embedded in other entities.2.2 Features and Class LabelFor each token, we generate four types of features,reflecting its characteristics on orthography, part-of-speech, morphology, and special nouns.
Wealso use a window of (-2, +2) as its context.For each token, we use two schemes to set theclass label: outmost labeling and inner labeling.
Inthe outmost labeling, a token is labeled +1 if theoutmost entity containing it is the target entity,while in the inner labeling, a token is labeled +1 ifany entity containing it is the target entity.Otherwise, the token is labeled -1.3 Experiment And DiscussionWe report our preliminary experimental results onrecognizing protein and DNA nested entities.
Foreach target entity type (e.g., protein) and eachlabeling scheme, we obtain a data set containing490941 instances.
We run 5-fold cross-validation,and measure performance (P/R/F) of exact match,left/right boundary match w.r.t.
outmost and innerentities respectively.
The results are shown inTable 1 and Table 2.Outmost labeling(P/R/F)Inner labeling(P/R/F)Exact 0.772 /0.014 /0.028 0.705 /0.017 /0.033Left 0.363 /0.373 /0.368 0.173 /0.484 /0.254OutmostEntitiesRecognized Right 0.677 /0.199 /0.308 0.674 /0.208 /0.318Overall 0.60/0.20/0.23 0.52/0.24/0.20Exact 0.692 /0.229 /0.344 0.789 /0.679 /0.730Left 0.682 /0.289 /0.406 0.732 /0.702 /0.717InnerEntitiesRecognized Right 0.671 /0.255 /0.370 0.769 /0.719 /0.743Overall 0.68/0.26/0.37 0.76/0.70/0.73Table 1 Performance of nested protein entitiesFrom the tables, we can see that while the outmostlabeling works (slightly) better for the outmostentities, the inner labeling works better for theinner entities.
This result seems reasonable in thateach labeling scheme tends to introduces moreentities of its type in the training set.It is interesting to see that the inner labelingworks much better in identifying inner proteinsthan in inner DNAs.
The reason could be due tothe fact that there are about three times more innerproteins than the outmost ones, while the numbersof inner DNAs and outmost DNAs are roughly thesame (see Section 2.1).Another observation is that the inner labelinggains significantly (over the outmost labeling) inthe inner entities, comparing to its loss in theoutmost entities.
We are not sure whether this isthe general trend for other types of entities, and ifso, what causes it.
We will address this issue in ourfollowing work.Outmost labeling(P/R/F)Inner labeling(P/R/F)Exact 0.853 /0.005 /0.009 0.853 /0.005 /0.009Left 0.682 /0.542 /0.604 0.543 /0.555 /0.549OutmostEntitiesRecognized Right 0.324 /0.070 /0.114 0.321 /0.070 /0.115Overall 0.62/0.21/0.24 0.57/0.21/0.22Exact 0.269 /0.333 /0.298 0.386 /0.618 /0.475Left 0.272 /0.405 /0.325 0.336 /0.618 /0.435InnerEntitiesRecognized Right 0.237 /0.376 /0.290 0.350 /0.694 /0.465Overall 0.26/0.37/0.30 0.36/0.64/0.46Table 2 Performance of nested DNA entitiesWe hope these results can help in recognizingnested NEs, and also attract more attention to thenested NE problem.
We are going to further ourstudy by looking into more related issues.ReferencesJ.
