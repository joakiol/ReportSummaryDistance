The resu l tant  se ts  of wordpa i rs  of def ined and de f in ing  words were thencomputaCional ly connected in to  t~o taxonomic semi-la t t i ces  ( " tang led  h ie rarch ies" )  represent ing  some24,000 noun nodes and 11,000 verb nodes.
The study ofthe nature  of the "topmost" nodes in  these h ie rarch ies .and the s t ruc ture  of the t rees  revea l  in fo rmat ion  aboutthe nature of the dictionary's organization of thelanguage,  the concept of semantic p r imi t ives  and otheraspects  of lex ica l  semant ics .
The data proves that  thed ic t ionary  o f fe rs  a fundamenta l ly  cons is tent  descr ip t ionof word meaning and may provide the bas i s  for  fu tureresearch  and app l i ca t ions  in computat ional  l ingu is t i csystems.1.
INTRODUCTIONIn the la te  1960"s, John 01ney et  a l .
at  SystemDevelopment Corporat ion produced machine- readable  copiesof the Merriam-Webster New Pocke~ D ic t ionary  and theSevent~ Co l leg ia te  D ic t ionary .
Thesemassive data f i l es  have been w ide ly  d i s t r ibuted  w i th inthe computat ional  l ingu is t i c  community, yet  researchupon the bas ic  s t ruc ture  of the d ic t ionary  has beenexceed ing ly  slow and d i f f i cu l t  due to the S ign i f i cantcomputer esources  requ i red  to process  tens  of thousandsof de f in i t ions .The d ic t ionary  i s  a fasc inat ing  computat ional  resource .It conta ins  spe l l ing ,  p ronunc ia t ion ,  hyphenation,capitalization, usage notes for semantic domains,geographic  reg ions ,  and propr ie ty ;  e tymolog ica l ,syntact i c  and semant ic  in fo rmat ion  about the most bas icun i t s  of the language.
Accompanying de f in i t ions  areexample sentences  which o f ten  use words in  p ro to typ ica lcontexts .
Thus the d ic t ionary  should be ab le  to serveas a resource for  a var ie ty  of computat ional  l ingu is t i cneeds.
My primary concern w i th in  the d ic t ionary  hasbeen the development of d ic t ionary  data  for  use inunderstand ing  systems.
Thus I am concerned wi th  whatd ic t ionary  de f in i t ions  te l l  us about the semantic andpragmat ic  s t ruc ture  of meaning.
The hypothes is  I amproposing i s  that  de f in i t ions  in  the lex icon  can bes tud ied  in the same manner as other  la rge  co l lec t ions  ofob jec ts  such as p lants ,  an imals ,  and minera ls  ares tud ied .
Thus I am concerned wi th  enunerat ing  thec lass i f i ca t ions1  organ izat ion  of the lex icon  as i t  hasbeen imp l i c i t l y  used by the d ic t ionary ' s  lex icographers .Each textual definition in the dictionary issyntactically a noun or verb phrase with one or morekernel terms.
If one identifies these kernel terms ofdef in i t ions ,  and then proceeds to d isambiguate themre la t ive  to the senses o f fe red  in the same d ic t ionaryunder the i r  respect ive  de f in i t ions ,  then one can ar r iveat  a la rge  co l lec t ion  of pa i rs  of d isambiguated wordswhich can be assembled in to  a taxonomic semi - la t t i ce .This task  has been accompl ished for  a l l  the de f in i t iontexts  of nouns and verbs in  a comu~n pocket d ic t ionary .This paper i s  an e f fo r t  to revea l  the resu l t s  of ap re l iminary  examinat ion of the s t ruc ture  of thesedatabases.The app l i ca t ions  of th i s  data are s t i l l  in the fu ture .What might these app l i ca t ions  be?F i r s t ,  the data shoul'd prov ide in fo rmat ion  on thecontents  of semant ic  domains.
One should be ab le  todetermine from a lex ica l  taxonomy what domains onemight be in g iven one has encountered the word"periscope", or "petiole", or "petroleum".Second, d ic t ionary  data  should be of use in  reso lv ingsemantic ambigui ty  in text .
Words in  de f in i t ionsappear in  the company of the i r  p ro to typ ica lassoc ia tes .Third,  d ic t ionary  data  can provide the bas i s  forc reat ing  case gr- , -~-r  descr ip t ions  of verbs ,  and nounargument descr ip t ions  of nouns.
Semantic templates  ofmeaning are fa r  r i cher  when one cons iders  thetaxonomic inher i tance  of e lements of the lex icon .Fourth.
the d ic t ionary  should o f fe r  a c lass i f i ca t ionwhich anthropo log ica l  l i ngu is ts  and psycho l ingu is tscan use as an ob jec t ive  re ference  in comparison wi thother  cu l tu res  or human memory observat ions .

"TANGLED" HIERARCHIES OF NOVN S AND VERBSThe grant.
MCS77-01315, '~)evelopment of a ComputationalMethodology for  Der iv ing Natura l  Language SemanticS t ruc tures  v ia  Ana lys i s  of Machine-ReadableD ic t ionar ies" .
c reated  a taxonomy for  the nouns andverbs of the Merriam-Webster Pocket D ic t ionary  (MPD),based upon the hand-d isambiguated kerne l  words in  the i rdefinitions.
This taxonomy confirmed the ant i c ipateds t ruc ture  of the lex icon  to be that  of a " tang ledh ie rarchy"  \[8,9\] of unprecedented s i ze  (24,000 nounsenses .
11.000 verb senses) .
This data base i s  be l ievedto be the f i r s t  Co be assembled which i s  representat iveof the s t ruc ture  of the ent i re  Eng l i sh  lex icon .
(Asomewhat s imi la r  study of the I ta l ian  lex icon  has beendone \[2.11\] ) .
The content  categor ies  agreesubstant ia l l y  w i th  the semant ic  s t ruc ture  of the lex iconproposed by Nida \ [ I5 \ ] ,  and the verb taxonomy confirmsthe pr imi t ives  proposed by the San Diego LNR group \[16\] .This " tang led  h ie rarchy"  may be descr ibed  as a formaldata s t ruc ture  whose bottom is  a se t  of terminald isambiguated words that  are  not used as kerne l  de f in ingterms; these are the most spec i f i c  e lexents  in thes t ruc ture .
The tops of the s t ruc ture  are senses ofwords such as "cause" ,  " th ing" ,  '*c lass",  "being" ,  e tc .These are the most genera l  e lements in  the tangledh ie rarchy .
I f  a l l  the top terms are  considered to be133members of the metaclass "<word-sense>", the tangledforest becomes a tangled tree.The terminal nodes of such trees are in general eachconnected to the Cop in a la t t i ce .
An ind iv idua llattice can be resolved into a seC of "traces", each ofwhich describes an alternate paCh from terminal to cop.In a crate, each element implies the terms above iC, andfurther specifies the sense of the elements below it.The collection of lattices forms a transitive acyclicdigraph (or perhaps more clearly, a "semi-lattice", thatis, a lattice with a greatest upper bound, <word-sense>,but no least lower bound).
If we specify all the tracescomposing such a structure, spanning all paths from topto bottom, we have topologically spec i f ied  thesemi-lattice.
Thus the list on the left in Figure Itopologically specifies the tangled hierarchy on itsr ight .

.
The s i ze  of atang led  h ie rarchy  i s  based upon two numbers, the maximumdepth below the " root"  and the to ta l  number of nodest rans i t i ve ly  reachab le  from the root .
Thus the tang ledh ie rarchy  of F igure  1 has a depth of 5 and conCains ato ta l  of 11 nodes ( inc lud ing  the " root"  node, "a" ) .However, since each non-terminal in Che tangledh ierarchy  was a l so  enumerated, i t  i s  a l so  poss ib le  Codescr ibe  the "s i zes"  of che o ther  nodes reachab le  from"a" .

For example, "g" has the mostsingle-level descendants, 3, yet it is neither at theCop of the Cangled hierarchy, nor does iC have thehighest total number of descendants?
The root node "a"is at the top of the hierarchy, yet it only has Isingle-level descendant.
For nodes ?o he considered ofmajor importance in a tangled hierarchy it is chusnecessary to consider not only Cheir total number ofdescendants ,  buc whether Chese descendants  a re  a l laccua l ly  immediate ly  under some ocher node Co which th i sh igher  node i s  a t tached .

F i r s t .the lexicographers HAD to define CAUSE-2.0A using someother verb, etc.
This is inherent in the lexicon beingused to define itself.
Second, once one reaches the Copof a tengled hierarchy one cannot go any higher -- andconsequently forcing further definitions for bas ic  verbssuch as "be"  and "cause" invariably leads CO using morespec i f i c  verbs ,  ra ther  than  more genera l  ones .

"GROUP" Concept Primitive fromDictionary Definitions* Note: SECTIONS, PARTS, and GROUPINGS have additionalconnections not shown which lead to a relatedprimitive cluster dealing with the PART/WHOLE concept.This complex interrelated set of definitions comprise aprimitive concept, essentially equivalent to the notionof SET in mathematics.
The primitiveness of the set isevident when one attempts to define any one of the abovewords without using another of them in that definition.135This essential property, the inability to write adef in i t ion  exp la in ing  a word 's  meaning w i thout  us inganother  member of some smal l  se t  of near  synonymouswords,  is  the bas is  fo r  descr ib ing  such a set  as aPRIMITIVE.
It is based upon the  notion of definitiongiven by Wilder \[21\], which in turn was based upon apresentation of the ideas of Padoa, aturn-of-the-century logician.The definitions are given, the disambiguation of theirkerne l ' s  senses  leads  to a cyc l i c  s t ructure  which cannotbe reso lved  by a t t r ibut ing  er roneous  judgements  toe i ther  the lex icographer  or the d i sambiguator ;  there forethe s t ructure  i s  taken  as representat ive  of  anundefinable pyimitive concept, and the words whosedefinitions participate in this complex structure arefound Co be undefinable without reference to the othermembers of the set of undefined terms.The question of what to do with such primitives is notreally a problem, as Winograd notes \[22\], once onerealizes that they must exist at some leve l ,  just asmathematical primitives must exist.
In treeconst ruct ion  the so lu t ion  is to  form a s ing le  node whoseEng l i sh  sur face  representat ion  may be se lec ted  from anyof the words in  the pr imi t ive  set .
There probab ly  a reconnotat ive  d i f fe rences  between the members of  the set .but the ord inary  pocket  d ic t ionary  does not  t reat  thesein i t s  de f in i t ions  w i th  any deta i l .
The Merr iam-WebsterCol lemfaCe D ic t ionary  does inc lude  so -ca l led  "synonymparagraphs"  which seem to d i scuss  the connotat ived i f fe rences  between words shar ing  a " r ing" .While numerous s tud ies  of  lex ica l  domains such as theverbs  of  mot ion \ [1 ,12 ,13 \ ]  and possess ion  \[10\] have beencar r ied  out  by ocher  researchers ,  i t  i s  wor th  not ingthat  recourse  to us ing  ord inary  d ic t ionary  de f in i t ionsas a source  of mater ia l  has rece ived  l i t t le  a t tent ion .Yet the "pr imi t ives"  se lec ted  by Donald A. Norman,David E. Romelhar t ,  and the  LNR Research  Group fo rknowledge representat ion  in  the i r  system bear  aremarkable similarity to those verbs used must often askerne ls  in  The Merriam-Webster Pocket Dic t ionary  andDonald Sherman has shown (Table 4) these topmost verbsto be among the most common verbs  in  the  Co l leg ia teD ic t ionary  as we l l  \ [19 \ ] .
The most f requent  verbs  of  theMPD are ,  in descend ing  order .
MAKE, BE, BECOME, CAUSE,GIVE, MOVE, TAKE, PUT, FORM, BEING, HAVE.
and GO.
Thes imi la r i ty  of these  verbs  to  those  se lec ted  by the LNHgroup fo r  the i r  semant ic  representat ions ,  i.e., BECOME,CAUSE, CHANGE, DO, MOVE.
POSS ("have"), T~SF("give","take"), etc., \[10.14.18\] is striking.
Thissimilarity is indicative of an underlying "rightness" ofdictionary definitions and supports the proposition thatthe lexical information extractable frca study of thed ic t ionary  w i l l  prove to be the  same knowledge neededfor computational linguistics.The enumeration of the primitives for nouns and verbs byanalysis of the tangled hierarchies of the noun and verbforests grown from the MPD definitions is a considerableundertaking and one which goes beyond the scope of thispaper.

Even though undera strictly genus/differentia interpretation one wouldanalyze "leaf" as being in an ISA relationship with"outgrowth", "outgrowth" hasn't a suitable homogeneousset of members and a better interpretation for modelingthis definition would be to consider the "outgrowth of"phrase to signify a part/whole relationship between"leaf" and "plant".Hence we may consider the dictionary to have at leasttwo taxonomic relationships (i.e.
ISA and ISPART) aswell as additional relations explaining noun terminalsas verb arguments.
One can also readily see that therewill be taxonomic interactions among nodes connectedacross these relationship "bridges".While the parts of a plant will include the "leaves","stem", "roots", etc., the corresponding parts of anyTYPE of plant may have further specifications added totheir descriptions.
Thus "plant" specifies a functionalform which can be further elaborated by descent down itsISA chain.
For example, a "frond" is a type of  "leaf",frond - a usu.
large divided leaf (as of a fern)We knew from "leaf" that it was a normal outgrowth of a"plant", but now we see that "leaf" can be specialized,provided we get confirmation from the dictionary that a"fern" is a "plant".
(Such confirmation is only neededif we grant "leaf" more than one sense meaning, butwords in the Pocket Dictionary do typically average 2-3sense meanings).
The definition of "fern" gives us theneeded linkage, offering,fern - any of a group of flowerless seedless vasculargreen plantsThus we have a specialized name for the "leaf" appendageof a "plant" if that plant is a "fern".
This can berepresented as in Figure 6.ISPARTleaf - - - - - -==' ' ' ' '>  plant/\ /\II IIII IIII IIISA II II ISAII ilII IIII IIII ISPART \[\[frond =====~=~==="==''> fernF igure  6.
LEAF:PLANT::FHOND:FERNThis conclusion that there are two major transitivetaxonomies and that they are related is not of coursenew.
Evens eta l .
\[6,7\] have dealt with the PART-OFrelationship as second only to the ISA relationship inimportance, and Fahlmen \[8,9\] has also discussed theAs mentioned in Section 2.3, the use of "outgrowth" inthe definition of "leaf" causes problems in the taxonomyif we treat "outgrowth" as the true genus term of thatdefinition.
