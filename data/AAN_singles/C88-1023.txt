It is shown that unification inthe sense of Kay as used in unification grammars, andtl m~.sda,:t\[oa, a p~o~;ess deriving from automata theory,{~ ~-~ both  valuable tools for use in computationalpb,.m,.,k~gy.
By way of illustration, a brief outline ofthe allophsni.c parser described by Church is given.Then a linea~ unification partier for English syllables\[s intro./urea.

A fundamentald b%inct ion is made between two domains: the .representations at the phonetic and phonologicallevels, and the proc~.ssing of these representations.On this basis, a d\[~itinctisn is made between networksof tran~.di~ction relations <e.g.
between allophones andphonemes), and a .%et of possible processors (i.e.parsers and transducers) for the interpretation ofsuch networks.1.
'F~e~ne~du~tion and  Un i f i ca t ion  in  Phono logyThe proposal to use finlte-state transducers inmorphology and phonology has been advocated in recentyears by Kaplan and Kay /1981/, Koskenniemi /1983/ andothers, It has been suggested /Gibbon 1987!
thatfinlte-state transducers are the most appropriatedevices for use in other areas of computationalphonology.
In Koskennlemi's system, single finite--state transducers act as parallel fllters in theanalysis of Finnish morphology.
However, in hismorphophsnological analysis Koskennleml has beencritlcised for uslng monadlc segments rather than thefeature bundles which play such an important role inphonology /Gazdar 1985:601/.
In the proposalpresentcxl below, segments regarded as  feature bundle~are essential components in the model.
The quesLionas to whether it is better to represent thephonological rules as a cascade of transducers or toincorporate them into a single t ransducer  will not beconsidered here.
Kaplan and Kay /1981/ have alreadyput fowar'd a method of  compiling the series uftransducers into a sing\].
(-: transducer (described by Kay/1982/)), Below, for discussion purposes, a singletransducer is assumed.Furthermore 1 would llke to stress that on thephonological level I will discuss network\['epresen tahions of phonotact ic and allophoniccons'traln ts.
The transitions in these networksconsist of transduction relations.
In the proce.~sdomain a finite-state transducer will be used tointerpret the networks.
This is a distinction whichis not always made but is beneficial for abstractingthe attributes of the model from the processing of themodel.
Below more emphasis will be placed on therepresentation domain as it is this whlch is mostinteresting for" discussion purposes.
The actualimplementation of the processing domain as a programis regarded, theoretically, as a secondary but by nom~ns a minor issue.Unification is a concept which has become commonin linguistics in recent years due to the importantrole it plays in current syntactic theories such asFUG, LFG and GPSG.
However, it has not as yet playedan explicit part in phonological analysis.
Below Ipropose that, by employing elementary unificationmechanisms, assimilation and dis~imllation can bedea\].h wlth in a most satisfactory way.
Theunification used in this connection is based on thefunctional description unification described by KayI1984/.Here I will give an informal definition ofunification based on contradiction and set union andin terms of feature bundles, since this is therepresentation which will be used below.
Two feature.bundles composed of attribute-value pairs may be saidto unify if for each attribute in their union theredoes not exist an attribute of the same name with a106contradicting vahJe.

Therefore whena particular transition in the network is responsiblefor remevin 5 this allophonic information the inputtransition specification is {\[- cent\], \[- voice\],\[- s~bn\], \[- strid\], \[+ asp\]), and the output transitionspecification is {\[- cent\], \[~- voice\], \[- son\],\[- strid\]} (see Fig.l).
When this phonotactic net isinterpreted by a particular parser the phonetic inputis generally a string ef fu\]ly specifl~xl featurebundles *~nd in order to u'~e the output for recognitionpurposes the phonemic output will also be fullyspecified.
It i.% here that unification plays animportant role.indeed the features themselves may not berecosnisable.
This facility is advantageous forworkin~ with feature detectors at the front end as itis still possible to analyse what is known.
Thls, ofcourse, leads to underspecifk~l output which may beused in connection with a lexicon for recol{nltlonhypothesisin 5 .
I n  such cases the underspecifiedoutput, althoush representin~ classes of phonemes inthe various positions, will only allow thosecombinations of such classes which actually exist,thus llmltJng' possibilities available for hypothesis.Thus it is not necessary to check the lexicon forforms which accordln 5 to the rules of the languagecannot exist.l TS OTSVo ice  vo ic~son  sonstrld striaspf ~% t %jF ig .

If unification succeeds, thefully specific4 output bundle must contain the outputtransition specifications together with all thosefeatures from the fully specified input bundle notcontained in the input transition specification.
Inset the\[~retic terms, let us call the fully specifiedinput feature bundle lnFB, the input and outputtransition specifications ITS and OTS respectively; ifunification of InFB with ITS succeeds, the fullyspecified output bundle OutFB is OTS ~ (InFB / ITS).The phonetic input feature bundles may be alsounderspecified however.
This allows for circumstanceswhere the values of some features may not be known or4.
Gonst r 'a in in~ Pr inc ip lesChurch discusses a number of factors, most ofwhich date back to work by Morris Halle and arediscussed by Chomsky and Halle /1960/, which must betaken into consideration when desl6ning the modelI1983:1281 length, idiosyncratic systematic gaps,voicing assimilation, place assimi\].atien anddissimilation, sonority.
These can all be incorporatedvery easily into the network.
The fact that languagesrestrict sound combinations (Jdiosyncratlc gaps) andthe length of initlal/flnal consonant clusters is inany case the basis on which this network isconstructed.
Decreasing sonority from the nucleus ofthe syllable towards the margins would seem to be amatter of having \[son\] as a C-feature and adjustingthe value at the appropriate transition.With re~ard to phonotactic constraints, the C-.features on the transition labels may have variablevalues.
In other words we may cater for the fact thatall initial /s/ in Bn~lish may not be followed byvoiced plosives by havin 5 as input specifications forone of its followln~ transitions the C-features{\[- voc\], \[~ cent\], \[~ voice\], \[o son\], \[- strid\]) (seeFig.2).
~ here must have the same value in the threecases, this value bein~ assigned durin}~ unification.Unification would fall in this case for voiced plosivesas they would be specified for the feature~ {\[- reel,\[-cont\], \[+ voice\], \[- son\], \[- strld\]}.
A furtherconvention is Introduced, *tamely that once a featurehas been specified on a particular transition itremains until it is eKplicitly altered, ell a subsequenttransition.
In this way vowel harmony may beincorporated into such a network whereby the vowelsDeeificatlons would remain for subsequent transitionssince they would not be relevant for intervenin~consonants.1081 T~; ( I'l'*~;I "l'~q OT~Ii, I voc  w lc  a t r id  s t r ld  r~ c~mt  cx conL  v i i i  (;(} ~c l l  c;~ 5\[ ) I I  \ [ ;u i i%~-, %; %jF ig .

Assimilation and dissimilation aredealt with by Chomsky and l{aile /1968/ in terms ofvariables a.
~\] feature cfK~.fficients and it is this ,method which has been incorporated into the networkhere.
So for example, in eases of voice assimilation,the fe/Iture \[voice\] may be checked using a variable,say \ [a  vo lc~\] .
Therefore, where the particular i nputsegment ha~ the feature \[+ voice\], unification assignsthe value + to the undefin?Rl variable ?~ permanently,and slmilaFly in the case of a negative value.
Thisnewly found value together with the attribute willthen be a (k-feature in the input specification for thefollowing I ransltion unless exp\]icltly changed on thattransition.
This is a type of feature-passlngtechnique :~imilar to that employed in unification-based syn'i;actlc theories, but essentially simpler,slnce it is nsn-recurslve.Transltion weighting is also very important in thismodel, St\]kirk /1980/ emphasil~es that it is all verywell to cater for collocational restrictions but otherconstraining principles such as maxlmising snootsshould also) be incorporated into a syllable parser.Thus ironed\]ions are weighted in such a way that themost preferred path  out of the network is sought.
'Early closure' /Kimball 1973/ :for example, which seeksthe shorte~;t path out of the network, is equivalent tothe maxima\[ onset principle.
S t r~s  re~yllablflcatlonis simllar\]y dealt with using weighting.
Thus, suchconstraints are incorporated into the network in asimple and principled fashitm.5.
