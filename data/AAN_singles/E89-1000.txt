Bothprocesses eem to be inherently computational.
That is, to model changes in contextand attention requires consideration of the side effects of understanding and producingutterances.
Similarly, interpreting and responding to utterances as intentional behaviorrequires support for planning and plan inference.
This tutorial explores emergingcomputational models and methods for both contextual and intentional aspects ofdiscourse.Combinatory Categorial GrammarsMark Steedman (U Penn)The session will discuss a generalisation f Categorial Grammar based on the inclusionof a few syntactic operations related to "combinators", such as functional composition.The theory implies a radical revision of accepted notions of surface structure andconstituency, with interesting implications for theories of the production andcomprehension f spoken and written language.The theory will be presented in the first instance as a theory of syntactic ompetence,with particular attention to constructions involving coordination and unboundeddependency.
Attention will be paid to certain universal properties of suchconstructions across languages.
The discussion will then be widened to consider theimplications of this theory of syntax for selected problems in prosody and intonation,incremental semantic interpretation, and processing.- X V  ?The lexiconBran Boguraev (Cambridge Computer Lab & IBM Yorktown Heights)Knowledge of and about words underlies all natural anguage processing tasks.

USAAbstractIn this talk I would like to address ome issues of major importance in lexical semantics.
In particular, Iwill discuss four topics relating to current research in the field: methodology, descriptive coverage,adequacy of the representation, and the computational usefulness of representations.
In addressing theseissues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing the lexical semanticscommunity, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues.
Finally, I outline a theory of lexicalsemantics embodying a richer notion of compositionality, termed cocomposition, which aims to spreadthe semantic load more evenly throughout the lexicon.1.
IntroductionI believe we have reached an interesting turning point in research, where linguistic studies can beinformed by computational tools for lexicology as well as an appreciation of the computationalcomplexity of large lexical databases.
Likewise, computational research can profit from an awareness ofthe grammatical and syntactic distinctions of lexical items; natural language processing systems mustaccount for these differences in their lexicons and grammars.
The wedding of these disciplines is soimportant, in fact, that I believe it will soon be impossible to carry out serious computational researchin our field without the help of electronic dictionaries and computational lexicographic resources\[Walker, 1986\].
Positioned at the center of this synthesis is the study of word meaning, lexicalsemantics, which is currently witnessing a minor revival.Given this, I would like to turn to a few issues that I feel the lexical semantics community shouldaddress.
In particular, I will pose the following four questions:1.
Has recent work in lexical semantics been methodologically any sounder than the previous work inthe field?2.
Do theories being developed today have any broader coverage than the earlier descriptive work?3.
Do current heories provide any new insights into the representation f knowledge for the globalstructure of the lexicon?4.
Finally, has recent work provided the computational community with useful resources for parsing,generation, and translation research?Before answering these questions, I would like to establish two points that will figure prominently inour critique of the field.
The first is that, without an appreciation of the syntactic structure of alanguage, the study of lexical semantics is bound to fail.
There is no way in which meaning can becompletely divorced from the structure that carries it.
This is more a methodological point thananything else, since grammatical distinctions are a useful metric in evaluating competing semantictheories.c~--, - xvii -The second point is that the meanings of words should somehow reflect the deeper, conceptualstructures in the system and the domain it operates in.
This is tantamount tostating that the semanticsof natural language should be the image of (nonlinguistic) conceptual organizing principles (whatevertheir structure).Some of the major points I would like to make here are the following.
First, a clear notion of semanticwell-formedness will be necessary in order to characterize a theory of possible word meaning.
This mayentail idealizing the notion of lexical meaning away from other semantic influences.
For instance, thismight suggest that discourse and pragmatic factors should be handled ifferently or separately from thesemantic ontributions of lexical items in composition (contra \[Hobbs, 1987\].
Although this is not anecessary assumption and may in fact be wrong, it may help narrow our focus on what is important forlexical semantic descriptions.Secondly, lexical semantics must look for representations that are richer than thematic role descriptions\[Fillmore, 1968\].
As argued in \[Levin and Rappaport, 1986\], named roles are useful, at best, forestablishing fairly general mapping strategies to the syntactic structures in language.
The distinctionspossible with "theta" roles are much too coarse-grained toprovide a useful semantic interpretation of asentence.
What is needed, therefore, is a principled method of lexical decomposition.
This presupposes,if it is to work at all, (1) a rich, recursive theory of semantic omposition, (2) the notion of semanticwell-formedness mentioned above, and (3) an appeal to levels of interpretation i the semantics \[Scha,1983\].Thirdly, and related to the point above, the lexicon is not just verbs.
Recent work has done much toclarify the nature of verb classes and the syntactic onstructions that each allows \[Levin, 1985\].
Yet itis not clear whether we are any closer to understanding the underlying nature of verb meaning, why theclasses develop as they do, and what consequences these distinctions have for the rest of the lexiconand grammar.
The curious thing is that there has been little attention paid to the other lexical categories(but see \[Fass, 1988\].
That is, we have little insight into the semantic nature of adjectival predication,and even less into the semantics of nominals.
Not until all major categories have been studied can wehope to arrive at a balanced understanding of the lexicon and the methods of composition.2.
Methods in Lexical SemanticsGiven what I have said, let us examine the questions presented above in more detail.
Because of space,I will have little to say concerning question (4) in this short note.
First, let us turn to the issue ofmethodology.
How can we determine the soundness of our method?
Are new techniques available nowthat have not been adequately explored?
Very briefly, we can summarize the most essential techniquesassumed by the field, in some way, as follows (see, for example \[Cruse, 1986\]):1.
On the basis of categorial distinctions, establish the fundamental differences between the grammaticalclasses; the typicial semantic behavior of a word of category X.2.
Find distinctions between elements of a word class on the basis of collocation and cooccurrence t sts.For example, "dog" and "rock" partition into different classes due to certain features.3.
Test for distinctions of a grammatical nature on the basis of diathesis; i.e.
alternations that arerealized in the syntax.
For example, break vs. cut in (i) and (ii) below \[Hale and Keyser, 1986\].
(i) a.
The glass broke.b.
John broke the glass.
(ii) a.
*The bread cut.b.
John cut the bread.- xviii -This results in ever-finer distinctions in the semantic and syntactic behavior of verbs.4.
Test for entailments in the word senses of a word, in different grammatical contexts.
The samelexical item may carry different entailments in different contexts.
For example, "forget" in (i):(i) a. John forgot that he locked the door.b.
John forgot to lock the door.Sentence (a) has a factive interpretation of "forget" that (b) does not carry.5.
Test for the ambiguity of a word.
Distinguish between ambiguity and polysemy, (cf.
\[Hirst, 1987\],\[Fass, 1988\]) and from the accidental nature and the logical nature of ambiguity.
For example, theambiguity between the two senses of "bank" in (i)and the polysemy in (ii).
(i) a. the bank of the riverb.
the richest bank in the city(ii) a.
The bank raised its interest rates yesterday.b.
The store in next to the bank.6.
Establish what the compositional nature of a lexical item is when applied to other words.
Forexample, "alleged" vs. "tall" in the example below.
(i) a. the alleged suspectb.
the tall suspectWhile "tall" is a simple intersective modifier in (b) we must be aware of the intensional behavior ofadjectives such as "alleged" in (a).This just briefly characterizes some of the techniques that have been useful for arriving at pre-theoreticnotions of word meaning.
What has changed over the years are not so much the methods themselves asthe descriptive details provided by each test.
One thing that has changed, however, --and this issignificant-- is the way computational lexicography has provided stronger techniques and even newtools for lexical semantics research: for sense discrimination tasks \[Atldns 1987\]; for constructingconcept taxonomies \[Amsler 1985, Atldns, Klavans and Boguraev, forthcoming\]; for establishingsemantic relatedness among word senses \[Wilks et al 1988\]; as well as for testing new ideas aboutsemantic representations \[Boguraev and Pustejovsky, forthcoming\].3.
Descriptive Adequacy of Existing RepresentationsTurning now to the question of how current theories compare with the coverage of lexical semanticdata, there are two generalizations that should be made.
First, the taxonomic descriptions that have beenmade of verb classes are far superior to the classifications available twenty years ago (see \[Levin, 1985\]for review).
Using mainly the descriptive vocabulary of \[Talmy, 1975, 1985\] and \[Jackendoff, 1983\],fine and subtle distinctions are drawn that were impossible to capture in the earlier primitives-approachof \[Schank, 1972, 1975\] or the frame semantics of \[Fillmore, 1968\].
There are two problems with thecurrent work, however.
Unlike the theories of \[Wilks, 1975\] and \[Quillian, 1968\], there is no generalcoherent view on what the entire lexicon will look like when semantic structures for other majorcategories are studied.
Furthermore, it is not clear whether this work embodies a real theory ofknowledge representation.
We can, however, view this research as the first step towards constructing atheory of lexical semantics which is integrated into a linguistic theory, as well as interpreted in aknowledge representation system.- xix -4.
Explanatory Adequacy of  Existing RepresentationsFinally, let us turn to the question of whether current theories have changed the way we look atrepresentation a d lexicon design.
The question here is whether the representations assumed by currenttheories are adequate to account for the richness of natural language semantics.
It should be pointed outhere that a theory of lexical meaning will affect the general design of our semantic theory in severalways.
If we view the goal of a semantic theory as being able to recursively assign meanings toexpressions, (accounting for phenomena such as synonymy, antonymy, polysemy, metonymy, etc.
), thenour view of compositionality depends ultimately on what the basic lexical categories of the languagedenote.
Conventional wisdom on this point paints a picture of words behaving as either active functorsor passive arguments \[Montague, 1974\].
But if we change the way which categories can denote, thenthe form of compositionality itself changes.
Therefore, if done well, lexical semantics forces us toreevaluate the very nature of semantic omposition in language (see, for example \[Keenan and Faltz,1985\]).In what ways could lexical semantics affect the larger methods of composition in semantics?
Imentioned above that most of the careful representation work has been done on verb classes.
In fact,the semantic weight in both lexical and compositional terms usually falls on the verb.
This has obviousconsequences for how to treat lexical ambiguity.
For example, consider the verb "bake" in the twosentences below.
(1) a. John baked the potato.b.
John baked the cake.\[Atkins, Kegl, and Levin, 1988\] demonstrate that verbs such as "bake" are ambiguous, with both a"change-of-state" sense (la) and a "create" sense (lb).A similar ambiguity exists with verbs that allow the resulative construction, shown in (2) and (3), anddiscussed in \[Dowty, 1979\], \[Jackendoff, 1983\], and \[Levin and Rapoport, 1988\].
(2) a. Mary hammered the metal.b.
Mary hammered the metal flat.
(3) a. John wiped the table.b.
John wiped the table clean.On many views, the verbs in (2) and (3) are ambiguous, related by either a lexical transformation\[Levin and Rapoport, 1988\], or a meaning postulate \[Dowty, 1979\].
In fact, given strict requirements onthe way that a verb can project its lexical information, the verb "run" in (4) will also have two lexicalentries, depending on the syntactic environment it selects \[Talmy, 1985\], \[Levin and Rappaport, 1989\].
(4) a. Mary ran yesterday.b.
Mary ran to the store yesterday.These two verbs differ in their semantic representations, where the "run" in (4b) means "go-to-by-means-of-running", while in (4a) it means simply "move-by-running".The methodology described above for distinguishing word senses is also assumed by those working inmore formal frameworks.
For example, \[Dowty, 1985\] proposes multiple entries for control and raisingverbs, and establishes their semantic equivalence with the use of meaning postulates.
That is, the verbsin (5) and (6) are lexically distinct but semantically related by rules.
(5) a.
It seems that John likes Mary.b.
John seems to like Mary.- XX -(6) a. Mary prefers that she come.b.
Mary prefers to come.Given the conventional notions of function application and compositionality, there is little choice but totreat all of the above cases as polysemous verbs.
Yet, something about the systematicity of suchambiguity suggests that a more general, simpler explanation should be possible.
By relaxing theconditions on how the meaning of a complex expression is derived from its parts, we can, in fact, arriveat a very straightforward explanation for cases of "logical polysemy.
"The basic idea is this.
Rather than treating the expressions that behave as arguments to a function assimple, passive objects, imagine that they are as active in the semantics as the verb itself.
The productof function application would be sensitive to both the function and its active argument.
Something likethis is suggested in \[Keenan and Faltz, 1985\], as the "Meaning-Form Correlation Principle.
"What I have in mind can best be illustrated by returning to the examples in (1).
Rather than havingtwo word senses for a verb such as "bake," suppose there is simply one, a "change-of-state."
Now,assume that "bake" can be lexically specified as a Process verb \[Pustejovsky, 1988\].
It is a generalproperty of Processes, that they can shift their "aspectual type" to become a telic event.
For example,"push the wagon" can shift from a Process to a Transition ("push the wagon to Mary") by generalprinciples of event composition (cf.
\[Pustejovsky, 1988\]).
Assume further, that our semantic theorymakes a logical distinction between "potatoes" and "cakes" in terms of natural versus artifactual objects.Any artifact can be identified with the state of being that object, along with the purpose of the object,and other information.
Most importantly, however, an artifact has a kind of stative interpretation aspartof its meaning.Notice that the two senses for "bake" in (1) are the result of compositionality in a richer sense.
Forobserve that the "create" sense arises by the same principle of event composition mentioned above.Namely, that there is a baking process, and it results in a cake.
This is the "create" sense, and it ispresent just in those cases where an artifactual stative is already encoded in the argument (see\[Pustejovsky, 1989\] for details).In fact, similar principles eem to be operating in the examples mentioned in (2) through (4); namely,systematic ambiguity is the result of principles of semantic omposition, rather than lexical ambiguity.
Iwill call this particular kind of case "cocompositionality.
"In explaining the behavior of the systematic ambiguity above, I made reference to properties of theNoun Phrase that are not typical semantic properties for nouns in linguistics, e.g.
artifact, natural kind.In \[Pustejovsky, 1989\] and \[Pustejovsky and Anick, 1988\], I suggest that there is a system of relationsthat characterizes the semantics of nominals, very much like the argument structure of a verb.
I call thisthe "Qualia Structure", adopting a term from \[Goodman, 1951\].
Essentially, the qualia structure of anoun determines its meaning as much as the list of arguments determines a verb's meaning.
Theelements that make up a qualia structure include notions such as "container," space," "surface,""figure," artifact," and so on.When we combine the qualia structure of a NP with the argument structure of a verb, we begin to see aricher notion of compositionality emerging, one that looks very much like object-oriented approaches toprogramming \[Ingria nd Pustejovsky, 1988\].
As an example, consider the two senses of "window" and"door" in (7) and (8) below:(7) a. John crawled through the window.b.
The window is closed.
(8) a. Mary painted the door.b.
Mary walked through the door.
?- xxi  -Each noun appears to have two senses: an object denotation, and a portal denotation.
We cancharacterize the meaning of such "Double Figure Ground" nominals as a three place relation, roughlysomething like N(Figure,Invert-Figure, Ground), where Figure refers to the artifact itself, Invert-Figurerefers to the portal, and Ground is a reference constant.
The foregrounding or backgrounding of anominal's qualia is very similar to argument structure-changing operations for verbs.
That is, in (Sa)"paint" applies to the Figure interpretation of "the door," while in (8b), "through" will apply to theInvert-Figure interpretation of the same NP.
The ambiguity with such nouns is a logical one, one that isintimately linked to the semantic representation f the object itself.
The qualia structure is a way ofcapturing this fact.Having discussed the notion of logical polysemy, let us conclude our brief discussion of lexicalsemantics with the issue of metonymy.
Metonymy, where a subpart or related part of an object"stands" for the object itself, also poses a problem for standard enotational theories of semantics.
Forexample, how can we account for the reference shifts such as those shown in (9)?
(9) a. Thatcher vetoed the channel tunnel.b.
Mary enjoyed the book.I suggest that these are cases of semantic "type coercion", where the verb has coerced the meaning of aterm phrase into a different semantic type.
In the case of (9a), it is obvious that what is vetoed is someproposal relating to the object.
In (9b), the book is enjoyed only by virtue of some event or process thatinvolves the book, performed by Mary.
It might furthermore be reasonable to assume that the qualiastructure of "book" specifies what the artifact is used for; i.e.
reading.
Such coercion results in a wordsense for the NP that I will call "logical metonymy."
Roughly, logical metonymy is where a logicalargument of a semantic type (selected by a function) denotes the semantic type itself.
For details see\[Pustejovsky, 1989\].Another interesting example involves the possible subjects of causative verbs.
These are also cases oflogical metonymy.
Consider the sentences in (10) and (11).
(10) a.
The pictures of himself rightened John.b.
A cup of coffee in the morning woke John up.
(11) a. John killed Mary.b.
The gun killed Mary.c.
John's stupidity killed Mary.d.
The war killed Mary.e.
John's pulling the trigger killed Mary.The sentences in (10) illusffate the various syntactic onsequences of metonymy and coercion involvingexperiencer verbs, while those in (11) show the different "metonymic extensions" possible from thecausing event in a killing.
The generalization here is that when a verb selects an event as one of itsarguments, type coercion to an event will permit a limited range of logical metonymy.5.
ConclusionIn this paper I have tried to cover what I believe are currently some of the most interesting issues inlexical semantics.
I have also tried to outline an approach to meaning where the semantic load isspread more evenly throughout the lexicon.
This entails a semantic description of noun classes, termeda "theory of Qualia," as well as the rules of composition that allow this information to be incorporatedinto the semantic interpretation of larger expressions.
Although much of what I have presented isincomplete and somewhat programmatic, I firmly believe this approach can help clarify the nature ofword meaning and compositionality in natural anguage.- xxii -AcknowledgementsI would like to thank Dan Fass for lengthy discussion on many of the issues mentioned here.
