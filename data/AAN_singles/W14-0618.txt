Areference ontology is used to evaluate thegenerated ontology.
The reference ontologycontains concepts and properties within thewayang character domain.
We examined theinfluence of corpus data variations, thresholdvalue variations in the relation clusteringprocess, and the usage of entity pairs or entitypair types during the feature extraction stages.The constructed ontology is examined usingthree evaluation methods, i.e.
cluster purity(CP), instance knowledge (IK), and relationconcept (RC).
Based on the evaluation results,the proposed method generates the bestontology when using a consolidated corpus,the threshold value in relation clustering is 1,and entity pairs are used during featureextraction.1 IntroductionAs a country rich in cultural diversity, Indonesiacertainly has an outstanding wealth of nationalculture.
Wayang (shadow puppets performanceart) is one instance of Indonesian culture that hascultural values and noble character.
Although thestories are generally taken from the Mahabharataand Ramayana books, they involve the wisdomand greatness of the Indonesian culture.
Wayangshows rely heavily on the knowledge andcreativity of the puppeteer (dalang).
Often, thestory and knowledge about the shadow puppetsis known only to the puppeteer and not set forthin writing.
Such a lack of knowledge transferprocess results in a lot of knowledge that isknown only by the puppeteer cannot be shared toothers, which leads to the loss of culturalrichness.
The knowledge held by the puppeteerought to be propagated to future generations inorder to be learned and developed.Information about the shadow puppets can berepresented as textual data describing hundredsof characters.
Constructing an ontology manuallyfrom such a large data source is time consumingand labor intensive.Work on relation extraction has already beenconducted in the past.
Initially, supervisedlearning approaches were used, for examplefeature-based supervised learning (Kambhatla,2004; Zhao and Grishman, 2005).
Some featuresthat are generally used are words that lie amongthe entities, the entity type, the number of wordsbetween two entities, and the number of entitiesbetween two entities.
In addition, there areseveral studies that use kernel-based approach.The kernel K(x, y) defines the similarity betweenobjects x and y in the high-dimensional objects.There are various elements used to constructkernels such as word subsequence (Bunescu andMooney, 2005) and parse trees (Zelenko et al.,2003; Culotta et al., 2004).In addition, several studies use semi-supervised learning.
DIPRE (Brin, 1998) tries tofind the relationship between the author interestand the book he/she had written.
Snowball(Agichtein and Gravano, 2000) uses anarchitecture that is not very different fromDIPRE to determine the relationship between anorganization and its location.
Meanwhile,Knowitall (Etzioni at al., 2005) examines relationextraction in heterogeneous domains of text data128from the web automatically.
Finally TextRunner(Banko at al., 2007) is a system thatautomatically searches the relationships betweenentities that exist in a corpus.
This methodproduces a binary relation (e1, r, e2) where e1 ande2 are entities and r is a relation between them.Work on automatic ontology construction hasbeen done by several researchers.
Celjuska et al.
(2004) developed a semi-automatic ontologyconstruction system named Ontosophie.
Thesystem generates an ontology with the instancesderived from unstructured text.
Shamsfard et al.
(2004) developed an automatic ontologyconstruction approach which utilizes a kernelbased method.
Alani et al.
(2003) tries toconstruct an ontology using data from the web.The system, named Artefakt, performsinformation summarization about the artist.Furthermore, the constructed ontology is used togenerate personalized narrative biographies.
Thesystem consists of three components, namelyknowledge extraction, information management,and biography construction component.The majority of the information extractionmethods mentioned above require reliable NLPtools and resources.
Unfortunately these are notreadily available for Indonesian, the languageour wayang data is in.
To overcome thischallenge, we employ information extractionmethods that only require simple resources suchas gazetteers and stopword lists, which arepotentially used in a variety of problem domains.In this study, we explore methods toautomatically construct an ontology using acorpus of wayang character descriptions usingrelation extraction and clustering.
This methodrequires a gazetteer which contains a list ofentities from the text.
The entity types that arecontained in the gazetteer are the name of thepuppet characters, their kingdoms of origin, andtheir various artefacts such as weapons or spells.We realize our method does not yet fullyconstitute the development of a completeontology, but provides an important step towardsthat direction, namely the identification ofrelations to be found within the ontology.2 Automatic Ontology ConstructionWe aim to automatically build a wayangontology from free text.
The information orknowledge that is contained within the text isextracted by employing relation extraction.
Thismethod will extract instance candidates that aresubsequently clustered using relation clustering.Furthermore, the ontology will be evaluatedusing a reference ontology to examine the qualityof the constructed ontology.
The stages ofautomatic ontology construction and evaluationare depicted in Figure 1.2.1 Automatic Ontology ConstructionDuring this stage, the system attempts to find allpossible relationships that occur between anytwo entities.
These relationships are furtheranalysed to obtain a set of valid relationshipsbetween entities.
The valid relations will be usedto construct the ontology.
The ontologyconstruction stage is depicted in Figure 2.Figure 1.
Automatic ontology constructionand evaluation stagesFigure 2.
The ontology construction stagesFreeText(rawdata)EntitytaggingPronounResolutionRelationExtractionFeatureextractionRelationClustering129The raw data is free text that consists ofseveral paragraphs describing short biographiesof wayang characters.
Firstly, the free text istagged using gazetteer data, i.e.
a list of entitiescontained in the text.
Every word contained inthe gazetteer will be tagged in accordance to itsentity type.
The number of entities in thegazetteer is still general.
Thus, the entities aresubdivided into more specific groups.
The entitygroup is based on Pitoyo Amrih (Amrih, 2011)which consists of 29 groups.
In this study weused two tagging methods, i.e.
by using awayang entity that has not been detailed and byusing detailed entities (based on the type ofwayang entity).
Different tagging treatment wasconducted to examine whether this affects theontology result or not.
The example of taggedtext using wayang entity that has not beendetailed and detailed entities can be seen inFigures 3 and 4.Subsequently, pronoun resolution is employedto resolve the entity reference of a pronoun.
Thesystem will then perform relation extraction byanalyzing the words occurring between taggedentities.
This process will generate candidaterelationship patterns between entities (X, r, Y),where X and Y are entities and r is the textualpattern that defines the relationship between thetwo entities.The patterns that are obtained from theprevious process are passed on to the next stepthat is the process of eliminating irrelevantinformation, so that only valid are used in thenext process.
It runs as follows:1.
Discard stopwords and honorifics.2.
If there is a comma and punctuation locatedat the beginning of a pattern then the relation<BangsaKera> Anoman </BangsaKera> kera berbuluputih seperti kapas.

Discard punctuation and do the trimming.4.
If there is a pattern that is empty or exceeds5 words, the pattern is considered invalid.5.
Change the pattern to lowercase.The result of the data in Figure 3 after thisprocess can be seen in Figure 5.Subsequently, we perform feature extractionby converting the textual data into matrix form.This matrix contains the occurrence of candidatepatterns between all possible pairs of entities.There are two types of feature extraction triedout in this study, i.e.
based on entity pairs andentity type pairs.
The cell in row i and column kof this feature matrix is the occurrence frequencyof the ith pattern and the kth entity pair.
Thematrix form of Figure 5 when using featureextraction based on entity pairs is depicted inFigure 6.
The next step is to perform relationclustering using semantic relational similarity asa similarity measure in a feature domain.
Thetext patterns contained in each cluster aredeemed to represent the same relationship.
Theclustering process will ignore candidate patternsthat occur less than twice in the corpus.
Theresult of this process is a set of clusters that eachcontains textual patterns that have a greater orequal similarity degree to a given threshold.
Thepseudocode of this algorithm is depicted inFigure 7.The generated clusters in this processcomprise the relations found in the constructedontology.
The representative pattern, i.e.
thecandidate pattern that has the highest occurrencefrequency within a cluster, will be used as aproperty that describes the relationshiprepresented by a cluster.
Suppose there is acluster that contains three candidate patterns, e.g.?anak?
(child of) with an occurrence frequencyof 40, ?putera?
(son of) with an occurrencefrequency of 30, and ?mendekati?
(come near to),with an occurrence frequency of 3.
By using therepresentative pattern ?anak?
as a property, it isassigned as the relation between pairs of entitiesfound within this cluster.

The matrix form of Figure 51312.2 Evaluation2.2.1 Reference OntologyTo measure and ensure that the quality of theconstructed ontology is in accordance with whatis desired, we evaluate the constructed ontologyagainst a reference ontology.
The referenceontology acts like a ?label?
on the testing data inmachine learning.
The testing data label used inthe evaluation process is used to determine howaccurate and reliable the model established bymachine learning is in recognizing unseen data.The evaluation process is performed bycomparing the relations in the constructedontology with the labeled testing data.
As well asthe data labels in machine learning, the referenceontology will be used to test how accurate thesystem is able to generate ontology from free text.We define several ontology components thatcan be obtained from the knowledge of aparticular topic.
This knowledge is obtained bylooking at the types of entities and relationsamong them.
It can also be obtained by lookingat the group/category of any entity in the text.Each group/category defines the entityrelationship that will occur between one entity toanother one.The ontology components which are definedin the reference ontology are concept andproperty.
An illustration of the relationshipbetween concept and property can be seen inFigures 9 and 10.
A concept is something that isdescribed in the ontology and it can be one of:objects, category or class.
Concepts in thereference ontology are entities that areincorporated within the gazetteer categories i.e.puppet character, spell, weapons, and nations.The ontology property describes therelationship between one concept to another.
Byobserving the entity and relationship betweenthem we can obtain the potential properties.
Forexample, there are several entity groups, e.g.puppet character, kingdoms, weapons, and spell.Between each group there is the relationship thatmay occur.
This relationship may occur betweenentities within the group/category or amongentities contained in different group/categories.In this reference ontology, the authors definecertain properties that potentially appear in thetext.
There are 14 properties which consist of 11properties describing the relationship betweenperson and person, 1 property describing therelationship between person and country, 1property describing the relationship betweenperson and weapon, and 1 property describingthe relationship between person and spell.
Therelationship between concepts in the referenceontology is depicted in Figure 11.2.2.2 Evaluation methodAfter relation clustering, each cluster is groupedbased on the reference ontology property.
Thisgrouping is performed based on the synonym ofthe representative pattern on particular clusterand the property of reference ontology.
If therepresentative pattern does not match (i.e.
doesnot contain a synonym) with the ontologyreference property then it is ignored.In this research we use three evaluationmethods i.e.
cluster purity, instances ofknowledge, and relations concept.1.
Cluster Purity (CP)Cluster purity (CP) is the ratio between theFigure 9.
The relation between concept andproperty in ontologyFigure 10.
The example of concept andproperty relationFigure 11.
The relationship amongstconcept in a reference ontology132number of representative patterns and thenumber of all patterns in a cluster.
Cluster Purity(CP) calculation ignores singleton clusters, i.e.when there is only one pattern in a cluster.
It canbe formulated as seen below:CP = ?
?j jN 11where ?
(?1, ?2, ..., ?j) is the set ofrepresentative patterns for each cluster and N isthe number of patterns in a set of clusters.Each cluster contains textual patterns and itsoccurrence frequency.
For example, the result ofrelation clustering can be seen below.Cluster 1anak 32putra 12Cluster 2 raja 3Cluster 3 negara 24menangis 3The CP value of that relation clustering is%87.78)3241232( )2432( ????
?2.
Instances Knowledge (IK)Instances Knowledge (IK) evaluation is intendedto measure the information degree on eachproperty.
There is the possibility that therelationship among two entities is valid but theknowledge therein is not as expected.
Thisevaluation is performed by conducting queries ofmultiple instance samples.
The queries areinstance samples that have valid knowledge andare taken randomly from the corpus for eachproperty.
It can be formulated as seen below:IK (Propi) =????????
?j j iopQNAvg 1 Pr1where Propi is the ith property, j is a query for theith property, and N is the number of queries forthe ith property.For example, there are 6 instances forproperty anak (child of).
The instances areKakrasana putra Basudewa , Werkudara putraPandu., Kakrasana anak Baladewa, Rupakencaputra Palasara, Basukesti negara  Wirata, andDandunwacana negara  Jodipati.Then there are 5 queries for this property i.e.Kakrasana putra Basudewa, Werkudara anakPandu, Arjuna putra Pandu, Rupakenca putraPalasara, and Aswatama anak Durna.Based on that query, 3 instances are valid (1st,2nd, 4th) and the rest is invalid.
Thus, the IK valueis%6053 ?3.
Relation Concept (RC)Relation Concept is a measure to examine thevalid relations in each property.
A valid relationis an instance that has an appropriate relationshipwith the defined property in the referenceontology.
This evaluation can be formulatedbelow:(RC (Propi) = ?j opj iIvalidN 1 Pr )(1where Propi is the ith property ,)( Pr iopjIvalidisthe valid instances of the ith property, and N isthe number of pattern.For example, there are 6 instances forproperty anak (child of).
The instances areKakrasana putra Basudewa ,Werkudara putraPandu, Kakrasana anak Baladewa, Rupakencaputra Palasara, Basukesti negara Wirata andDandunwacana negara  Jodipati.There are 4 instances (1st-4th) that areappropriate and 2 instance (5th-6th) that are notappropriate to property anak (child of).
So that,the RC value is%66.6664 ?3 Experimental Data and SetupIn this research we obtain our raw web data fromtwo separate sources: ki-demang.com andWikipedia.
Ki-demang.com is a website thatcontains various Javanese culture such aswayang, gamelan (Javanese orchestra), Javanesesongs, Javanese calendar and Javanese literature.Meanwhile Wikipedia is the largest onlineencyclopedia, it provides a summary ofRamayana and Mahabharata characters.In this study, we will only use corpora in theIndonesian language, and use 3 types of corpora,namely ki-demang corpus (derived from ki-demang.com), Wikipedia corpus (derived fromid.wikipedia.org) and consolidated corpus(combination of ki-demang and Wikipediacorpus).Ki-demang corpus is containing wayangcharacter annotations according to Javanesecultural community.
The ki-demang corpus133writing and spelling is not as good as theWikipedia corpus.
Punctuation and spellingerrors frequently occur, as well as fairly complexsentence structures.
This corpus consists of 363wayang characters; where there are 187 puppetcharacters that have annotations and 176 puppetcharacters that do not have annotations.The Wikipedia corpus has substances ofwayang character annotation from theMahabaratha and the Ramayana book and it alsocontains the description of particular charactersin Indonesian culture.
The Wikipedia corpusconsists of 180 puppet characters, which all havetheir respective annotations.The last corpus is a combination of ki-demangand Wikipedia corpus.
Merging data from bothcorpora is expected to enrich the annotation ofwayang characters.
Combining these data led totwo perspectives in wayang character annotation,which is based on Mahabaratha/Ramayana bookand based on the Javanese culture community.In this study, we will perform someexperiments to examine the influence of variousparameters.
The parameters include thecorpus data variety, the threshold value in theclustering process, and the usage of entity pair orentity type pair during feature extraction.4 Result and AnalysisWe conduct experiments for various parameters.The constructed ontology is evaluated usingcluster purity (CP), instances knowledge (IK),and relation concept (RC).
The experimentresults and details of various parameters can beseen in Figures 12 and 13.For the first experiment we want to evaluatethe corpus variation.
The objective of thisexperiment is to find the most representativecorpus used in ontology construction.
Based onthe experiment, when the system is employingentity type pairs in feature extraction, ki-demangcorpus has a high CP (76.54%) rate and a lowerIK (11.49%) and RC (44.8%) rate.
When the CPrate is high, it means that the pattern variation inparticular cluster is modest and tends to be asingleton (only one pattern in a cluster).
It is theimpact of the information homogeneity of ki-demang corpus compared to the other corpora.The IK and RC rate of Wikipedia corpus andconsolidated corpus is better than ki-demangcorpus.
The Wikipedia corpus has betterinformation content compared to the ki-demangcorpus, thus the consolidated corpus has a betterRC and IK rate compared to individual corpora.Meanwhile, when the system employs entitypairs during feature extraction stage, the theconsolidated corpus has a fairly better resultcompare to single corpus.
It means that theconsolidated corpus has richer information thanki-demang or Wikipedia corpus.The second experiment was conducted toevaluate the threshold value in clustering process.The objective of this experiment is to find thebest threshold value for relation clustering.
Forfurther analysis in a corpus variation, we usedthe average value of cluster purity (CP),instances knowledge (IK) and relation concept(RC) for all corpora.
When the system employsentity type pairs during feature extraction, the CPrate is 97.15%, IK rate is 49.43%, and RC rate isThresholdCorpus1 0.75 0.5 0.25CP IK RC CP IK RC CP IK RC CP IK RCKi-demang 96.53 19.54 63.95 96.52 19.54 63.95 95.88 19.54 62.02 94.27 12.64 58.83Wikipedia 99.38 79.31 75.60 98.66 79.31 76.24 88.71 75.86 67.14 65.31 75.86 61.10Consolidated 98.50 93.10 80.08 62.29 91.95 79.82 53.95 91.95 75.61 46.94 88.51 71.41Figure 12.

The evaluation result of entity pair type usage in feature extraction13464.41% for threshold value is 1.
This result isalways higher than using other threshold value.Hereafter, when the system employs entitypairs during feature extraction, the CP rate is98.14%, the IK rate is 49.43%, and RC rate is64.41% for threshold value is 1.
Given theexperiment result, it is clear that a thresholdvalue of 1 always gives a better result than theother threshold values.
The higher patternsimilarity in a cluster will yield a betterconstructed ontology result.The last experiment was conducted toevaluate the consequence of using entity pairs orentity type pairs during feature extraction to theconstructed ontology.
For further analysis in afeature extraction variation, we used the averagevalue of cluster purity (CP), instances knowledge(IK) and relation concept (RC) for all thresholdvalue in a clustering process.. Based on theexperiment result above, the usage of entity pairsin feature extraction always brings a better resultthan the entity type pairs.
When using entity typepairs in feature extraction, it will reduce somedetail of extracted feature.
The feature onlydescribes the relationship of entity type, not theentity itself.
This leads to suboptimallyconstructed ontologies.5 ConclusionThis paper presented a model for automaticontology construction from free text.
Firstly,relation extraction is used to retrieve thecandidate patterns.
Furthermore, relationclustering is used to group relations that have thesame semantic tendency.
An experiment hasbeen carried out on various parameters such ason the corpus variety, the threshold value inrelation clustering process, the usage of simpleprocess for eliminating irrelevant informationand the usage of entity pairs or entity type pairsduring feature extraction.Based on the experimental result, theconsolidated corpus (combination of ki-demangand Wikipedia corpus) is most beneficial inontology construction.
By integrating the corpus,it will increase the information quality whichyields a better result.
Meanwhile for the otherparameters, the most beneficial result is obtainedwhen using 1 as a threshold value in clusteringprocess, and using entity pairs during featureextraction.
The higher pattern similarity in acluster will yield a better resulting ontology.Furthermore, simple processing is employed toremove some punctuation, stopwords andhonorifics which are a source of noise in theextracted patterns.
The usage of entity type pairsduring feature extraction will result in reduced orlost detail of pattern features and bring adetrimental consequence to the ontology result.ReferencesAgichtein, Eugene, & Gravano, Luis.
