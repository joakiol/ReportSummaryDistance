The Semantics of Col locational Patterns forReport ing VerbsSabine BerglerComputer Science DepartmentBrandeis UniversityWaltham, MA 02254e-mail: sabine@chaos.cs.brandeis.eduAbst rac tOne of the hardest problems for knowledge xtractionfrom machine readable textual sources is distinguishingentities and events that are part of the main story fromthose that are part of the narrative structure, hnpor-tantly, however, reported sl)eech in newspaper articles ex-plicitly links these two levels.
In this paper, we illustratewhat the lexical semantics of reporting verbs must incor-porate in order to contribute to the reconstruction ofstoryand context.
The lexical structures proposed are derivedfrom the analysis of semantic ollocations over large textcorpora.I Mot ivat ionWe can distinguish two levels in newspaper articles:the pure information, here called primary informa-lion, and the meta-informati0n , which embeds theprimary information within a perspective, a beliefcontext, or a modality, which we call circumstan.-tim information.
The distinction is not limited to,but is best illustrated by, reported speech sentences.Here the matrix clause or reporting clause corre-sponds  to the circumstantial: information, while thecomplement (whether realized as a full clause or asa noun phrase) corresponds t'o primary information.For tasks such as knowledge xtraction it is the pri-mary information that is of interest.
For example inthe text of Figure 1 the matrix clauses (italicized) givethe circumstantial information of the who, when andhow of the reporting event, while what is reported (theprimary information) is givel~ in tile complements.The particular eporting verb also adds importantinformation about the manner of the original utter-ance, the preciseness of tile quote, the temporal rela-I, iolJship between ,uatrix clause and e(mq~h:me,l,, amlmore.
In addition, the source of tile original infor-mation provides information about the reliability orcredibility of the primary information.
Because theindividual reporting verbs differ slightly but impor-tantly in this respect, it is the lexicai semantics thatmust account for such knowledge.US Adv is ing  Th i rd  Part ies  onHostages(R1) The Bush administration continued toinsist ~esterday that (CI) it is not involvedin negotiations over the Western hostages inLebanon, (R2) but acknowledged that (C2) USolliciais have provided advice to and have beenkept informed by "people at all levels" who areholding such talks.

.Figure 1: Boston Globe, March 6, 1990We describe here a characterization of influenceswhich the reporting clause has on the interpretationof the reported clause without fully analyzing the re-ported clause.
This approach necessarily eaves manyquestions open, because the two clauses are so inti-mately linked that no one can be analyzed fully inisolation.
Our goal is, however, to show a minimalrequirement on the lexical semantics of tile words in-volved, thereby enabling us to attempt a solution tothe larger problems in text analysis.The lexicai semantic framework we assume ill thispaper is that of the Generative Lexicon introduced hyPustejovsky \[Pustejovsky89\].
This framework allowso.

The most unmarked report-ing verb is say.
The only presupposition for say isthat there was an original utterance, the assumptionbeing that this utterance is represented as closely aspossible.
In this sense say is even less marked than re.porl, which in addition specifies an a(Iressee (usuallyimplicit from the context.
)The other members in the semantic fieM are setapart through their semantic collocations.
Let usconsider in depth the case of insist.
One usage cart befound in the first part of the first sentence in Figure 1,repeated here as (1).1 The Bush administration continued to insist yes-terday that it is not involved in negotiations over theWeslern hostages in Lebanon.The lexical definition of insist in the Long-man Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOGE)\[Procter78\] isinsist 1 to declare firmly (when opposed)and in the Merriam Webster Pocket Dictionary(MWDP) \[WooJrr4\]:insist to take a resolute stand: PER, SIST.The opposition, mentioned explicitly in LDOCEbut only hinted at in MWDP, is an important partof the meaning of insisl.
In a careful analysis of a250,000 word text base of TIME magazine articlesfrom 1963 (TIMEcorpus) \[Berglerg0a\] we confirmedthat in every sentence containing insist some kind ofopposition could be recovered and was supported bysome other means (such as emphasis through wordorder etc.).
Tire most common form of expressingthe opposition was through negation, as in (1) above.In an automatic analysis of the 7 million wordcorpus containing Wall Street Journal documents(WSJC) \[Berglerg0b\], we found the distribution ofpatterns of opposition reported in Figure 2.
Thisanalysis shows that of 586 occurrences of insistthroughout tim VVSJC, 10O were instances of the id-iom insisted on which does not subcategorize for aclausal complement.

While this is a rough analy-sis ;rod contains ome "noise", it supports the findingsof our carefid study on the TIMEcorpus, namely thefollowing:2 A propositional opposition is implicit in the lexicalsemantics of insist.This is where our proposal goes beyond tra-ditional colloeational information, as for exam-ple recently argued for by Smadja and McKeown\[Smadja&McKeown90\].
They argue for a flexible lex-icon design that can accomodate both single word eu-tries and collocational patterns of different strengthand rigidity.
But the collocations considered in theirproposal are all based on word cooccurrences, nottaking advantage of the even richer layer of semanticcollocations made use of in this proposal.
Semanticcollocations are harder to extract than cooccurrencepatterns--the state of the art does not enable us tofind semantic ollocations automatically t. This paperhowever  argues that if we take advantage of lexicaiparadigmatic behavior underlying the lexicon, we canat least achieve semi-automatic extraction of seman-tic collocations (see also Calzolari and Bindi (1990)I But note the important work by Hindle \[HindlegO\] onextracting semantically similar nouns based on their substi-tutability in certain verb contexts.
We see his work as verysimilar in spirit.- 2 !7  -and Pustejovsky and Anick (1990) for a descriptionof tools for such a semi-automatic acquisition of se-mantic information from a large corpus).Using qualia structure as a means for structuringdifferent semantic fields for a word \[Pustejovsky89\],we can summarize the discussion of tile lexical se-mantics of insist with a preliminary definition, mak-ing explicit tile underlying opposition to the ,xssumedcontext (here denoted by ?)
and the fact that insistis a reporting verb.3 (Preliminary Lexical l)elinition)ins is t (A ,B)\[Form: Reporting Verb\]\[7'elic: utter(A,B) & :1?

In this section we will show thatreporting verbs as a class allow logical metonymy\[Pustejovsky91\] \[l'ustejovsky&Anick88\].
An examplecaLL be found in (1), where the metonymy is found intile subject, NP.
The Bush administration is a com-positional object of type administration, which is de-fined somewhat like (4).4 (Lexical l)elinition)admin is t ra t ion\[Form: + pluralpart of: institution\]\[Telic: execute(x, orders(y)),where y is a high officialin the specific institution\]\[Constitutive: + humanexecutives,officials,...\]\[Aoentive: appoint(y, x)\]In its formal role at least, i an administration doesnot fldfill the requirements for making an utterance--only in its constitutive role is there the attribute \[4_human\], allowing for the metonymic use.Although metonymy is a general device - -  in thatit can appear in almost any context and make useof associations never considered before 2 - -  a closer2As the well-known examl)h." The ham sandwich ordered an-other coke.
illustrates.look at the data reveals, however, that metonymy asused in newspaper articles is much more restrictedand systematic, corresponding very closely to logicalmetonymy \[Pustejovsky89\].Not all reporting verbs use the same kind ofmetonymy, however.
Different reporting verbs selectfor different semantic features in their source NPs.More precisely, they seem to distinguish between asingle person, a group of persons, and an institution.We confirmed this preference on the TIMEcorpus,extracting automatically all tile sentences containingone of seven reporting verbs and analyzing these databy hand.
While the number of occurrences of each re-portitLg verb was much too small to deduce tile verb'slexical sema,Ltics, they nevertheless exhibited inter-esting tendencies.Figure 3 shows the distribution of the degree of an-imacy.
The numbers indicate percent of total occur-rence of the verb, i.e.
in 100 sentences that containinsist as a reporting verb, 57 have a single person astheir source.\]person I group I instil.

Admit, denied and insistthen fall ill one category that we call call here infor-mally \[-inst\], said and told fan in \[+person\], and claim?
and announce fall into a not yet clearly marked cate-gory \[other\].
We are currently implementing statisti-cal methods to perform similar analyses on WSJC.We hope that the impreciseness of an automatedanalysis using statistical methods will be counterbal-anced by very clear results.The TIMEcorpus also exhibited a preference forone particular metonymy, which is of special inter-est for reporting verbs, namely where the name ofa country, of a country's citizens, of a capital, oreven of the building in which the government residesstands for the government itself.
Examples are GreatBritain/ The British/London/ Buckingham Palaceannounced ....
Figure 4 shows the preference of the re-- 218-I)orting verbs for tiffs metonymy in subject position.Again the numbers are too small to say anythingabout each lexical entry, but the difference in pref-erence is strong enough to suggest it is not only dueto the specific style of the magazine, but that somemetonymies form strong collocations that should bereflected in the lexicon.

Not only was the logicalmetonymy discussed in the previous section perva-sive, but moreover a fairly rigid semanticgrammarfor the source NPs emerged.
Two rules of this se-mantic grammar are listed in Figure 5.source\[quant\] \[mod\] descriptor \["," name ","\] J\[descriptor j ( (a J the) rood)\] \[mod\] name J\[inst's I name's\]  descriptor \[name\] Jname "," \[a j the\] \[relation prep\] descriptor Jname "," \[a \] the\] name's (descriptorJ relation) \]name "," free relative clausedescriptor ,role I\[inst\] position I\[position (for I of)\] \[quant\] instFigure 5: Two rules in a semantic grammar for sourceNPsThe grammar exemplified in Figure 5 is partial - -  itonly captures the regularities found in the TIMEcor-pus.
Source NPs, like all NPs, can be adorned withmodifiers, temporal adjuncts, appositions, and rela-tive clauses of any shape.
Tile important observationis that these cases are very rare in thc corpus dataand must be dealt with by general (i.e.
syntactic)principles.The value of a specialized semantic grammar forsource NPs is that it provides a powerful interfacebetween lexical semantics, yntax, and compositionalsemantics.
Our source NP grammar compiles differ-eat kinds of knowledge.
It spells out explicitly thatlogical metonymy is to be expected in the contextof reportiog verbs.
Moreover, it restricts possiblemetonymies: the ham sandwich is not a typical sourcewith reporting verbs.
The source gralnmar also givesa likely ordering of pertinent information as roughlyCOUNTRYILOCATION ALLEGIANCE INSTITU-TION POSITION NAME.This information defines esscntially the schema forthe rei)resentation f the source in the knowledge x-I.raction domain.We are currently applying this grammar to thedata i,a WSJC in order to see whether it is specific tothe TIMEcorpus.
Preliminary results were encourag-ing: The adjustments needed so far consisted only ofsmall enhancements such as adding locative PPs atthe end of a descriptor.V LCPs  Lexical  Conceptua lParad igmsThe data that lead to our source NP gratmnar wasessentially collocational materiah We extracted tilesul)ject NPs for a set of verbs, analyzed the iexical-ization of tile source and generalized the findings a.In this section we will justify why we think that tileresults can properly be generalized and what impactthis has on tile representation i  the lexicon.It has been noted that dictionary definitions forma - -  usually slmllow - -  hierarchy \[Amsler80\].
Un-fortunately explicitness is often traded in for con-ciseness in dictionaries, and conceptual hierarchiescannot be automatically extracted from dictionariesalone.
Yet for a computational lexicon, explicit de-pendencies in the form of lexicai inheritance are cru-cial \[Briscoe&al.90\] \[Pustejovsky&Boguraev91\].
Fol-lowing Anick and Pustejovsky (1990), we argue thatlexical items having related, paradigmatic syntac-tic behavior enter into the same iezical conceptualparadigm.
Tiffs states that items within an LCP willhave a set ofsyntactic realization patterns for how the3A detai led report  on the analys is  can be found in\[BergleJX30a\]- 219  -word and its conceptual space (e.g.
presuppositions)are realized in a text.
For example, reporting verbsform such a paradigm.
In fact the definition of anindividual word often stresses the difl'erence betweenit and the closest synonym rather than giving a con-structive (decompositioual) definition (see LDOCE).
4Given these assumptions, we will revise our definitionof insist in (3).
We introduce an I,CP (i.e.
soma,J-tic type), REPOffFING VERB, which spells out thecore semantics of reporting verbs.
It also makes ex-plicit reference to the source NI ) grammar dist'ussedin Section IV as the default grammar for the subjectNP (in active voicc).
This general template allowsus to define the individval lexical entry concisely ina form close to norn,al dictionary d,;li,fifions: devia-tions and enhancements ,as well as restrictions of thegeneral pattern are expressed for the i,,dividnal en-try, making a COml)arison betweelt wo entries focuson the differences in eqtailments.5 (Definition of Semantic Type)REPORTING VERB\[Form: IA,B,C,D: utter(A,B)& hear(C,B)& utter(C, utter(A,B))& hear(D,utter(C, utter(A,B)))\]\[Constitutive: SU BJ ECT: type:SourceN P,COMPLEMENT \]\[Agent|re: AGENT(C), COAGENT(A)/6 (i,exical Definition)ins is t (A ,B)\[Form: ItEI)ORTING VEI(B\]\[Tclic: 3?

The entries also reflect~' l l ' he  not ion of LCPs  is of course related to the idea ofaemanl ic  fields \[Trier31\].their common preference not to participate in themetonymy that allows insiitulions to appear in sub-jcct position.
Note t, hat opposed and negate are notassumed to be primitives but decompositions; thesepredicates are themselves decomposed further in thelexicon.Insist (and other reporting verbs) "inherit" muchstructural inforrnation from their semantic type, i.e,the LCP REPOR'I3NG VERB.
It is the seman-tic type that actual.ly provides the constructive def-inition, whereas the individual entries only dclinCrefinements on the type.
This follows standardinheritance mechanisms for inheritance hierarchies\[Pustciovsky&Boguraev91\] \[Evans&Gazdar90\].Among other things the I,CI ) itEPOltTING VEiLBspecilles our specialized semantic grammar for oneof its constituents, namely the subject NP in non-passive usage.
This not only enhances tile toolsavailable to a parser in providing semantic con-straints useful for constituent delimiting, but alsoprovides an elegant:way to explicitly state which log-ical metonymies are common with a given class ofwords 5.VI SummaryReported speech is an important phenomenon thatcannot be ignored when analyzing newspaper arti-cles.
We argue that the lexicai semantics of reportiugvcrbs plays all important part in extracting informa-tion from large on-iiine tcxt bases.Based oil extensive studies of two corpora, the250,000 word TlMEcorpus and the 7 million wordWall Street Journal Corpus we identified that se-mantic coilocalious must be represented ill thelexicon, expanding thus on current trends to in-dude syntactic collocations in a word based lexicon\[Smadj~d~M cKeown90\].We further discovered that logical metonymy is per-vasive in subject position of reporting verbs, but thatreporting verbs differ with respect o their preferencefor different kinds of logical metonymy.
A carefulanalysis of seven reporting verbs in the TIMEcor-pus suggested that there are three features that di-vide the reporting verbs into classes according to thepreference for metonymy in subject position, namelywhether the subject NP refers to the source as a sin-gle person, a group of people, or an institution.The analysis of the source NPs of seven reportingverbs further allowed us to formulate a specialized se-SGrimshaw \[Grimshaw79\] argues that verbs also select fortheir complements on a semantic basis.

We are currently testing the com-pleteness of this grammar on a different corpus andare planning to implement a noun phrase parser.We have imbedded the findings in the framework ofPustejovsky's Generative Lexicon and qualia theory\[Pustejovsky89\] \[Pustejovsky91\].
This rich knowi-' edge representation scheme allows us to represent ex-plicitly the underlying structure of the lexicon, in-eluding the clustering of entries into semant.ic types(i.e.
I,CPs) with inheritance and the representationof information which wa.s previously considered pre-suppositional and not part of the lexicai entry itself.In this process we observed that the analysis of se-mantic collocations can serve as a measure of seman-tic closeness of words.Acknowledgements :  I would like to thankI.ily advisor, James Pustejovsky, for inspiring discus-sions and irlany critical readings.References\[Amsler80\] Robert A.
