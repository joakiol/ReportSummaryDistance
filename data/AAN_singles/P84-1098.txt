MA 02108Components of the machine-readable dictionary can beapplied in a number of information systems.
The most directapplications of the kind are in wordprocessing or in "writing-support" systems built on a wordprocessing base.
However,because a central function of any dictionary is in fact dataverification, there are other proposed applications incommunications and data storage and retrieval systems.Moreover, the complete interrelational electronic dictionary isin some sense the model of the language; and there are,accordingly, additional implications for language-basedinformation search and retrieval.In regard to wordprocessing, the electronic lexicon can serveas the base for spelling verification (in which the computerdetects many spelling or typographical errors} and spellingcorrection (in which the computer offers corrections to theerrors it has identified).
Because it is possible to developalgorithms that permit the computer to calculate the chancesthat the single best alternative it offers is actually correct, thissubstitution can in many cases be made automatically.
It is atthis point in the development of such systems wise to flag suchautomatic orrections for inspection by the operator.At the present ime, these processes generally depend uponthe application of strict frequency measures, which permit thelexicon to be reduced to small-machine proportions and therebyreduce the possibility of a false hit--the passing of a misspelledcommon word that happens to coincide in orthography with alegitimate but rare word.
As our ability to draw cognitiveinformation from text increases, and as available memoryincreases, then such limits can be abandoned.Truncation of the lexicon for other specific applications canbe considered.
It is possible, for example, to shape the lexiconto reflect a children's vocabulary and thereby to developspelling correction and other writing aids for the earlyeducational years on a very small machine base.
It is alsopossible to shape the lexicon to the needs of the educated adultuser, for whom information about common words isunnecessary, and thereby to provide an exceptionally richresource about "difficult" words within small-machine memoryfor on-line access to spelling, definition, and pronunciation.Configuring the lexicon pyramidally by frequency, including allwords of high frequency, seems an inevitable model to us now,but it is of course a kind of historical accident.As many of these comments already make clear, even if oneresolves to work within the linguistic bounds of the ordinaryprint dictionary, there are differences in the demands placedupon the dictionary by print applications and those arising outof electronic applications.
It is a matter of judgment or tastefor the print lexicographer not to include geographic andbiographic terms in the lexicon, but the electronic lexicographerdoes not have that latitude.Access to on-line dictionaries can be by the standardalphabetic means or by well-developed phonetic algorithms(which solve the conundrum of needing to know spelling beforebeing able to find spelling) or by definition (the reversedictionary).
As electronic itation for words and senses is doneon the basis of machine scans of print-composition tapes andeven of voice scans, then sensitive subject coding should permitthe development of lexicons tailored to the user profile, withattendant benefits in comprehensiveness and economy ofmemory.
One can conceive of dictionaries that monitor theirown use and respond by offering only unkown information tothe individual user.The dictionary that contains ynonymy is a resource in theconstruction of electronic synonym generators, of which there isat least one model that returns synonyms in the inflections ofthe source words, including phrasal synonyms, taking preciseaccount of all irregularities in doing so.
Presentation ofsynonyms is useful for "knowledge workers" but not for clericalworkers.If usage information is included in the dictionary, then it isdeliverable as a discrete electronic product.
The most directkey to specific usage guidance is by "trigger" words or phrasesthat call up guidance information for the operator, but muchmore sophisticated implementations are possible whenprogramming addresses grammar and syntax.In large-system anagement, where accuracy of alpha data isa consideration, the machine dictionary can be the base or oneof the bases for verification and correction of data streams incommunication or of stored data.
~hat  I have called thecomplete interrelational dictionary-fully coded to reflect therange of significant linguistic information-will serve as the basefor retrieving information by meaning rather than mechanics.463
