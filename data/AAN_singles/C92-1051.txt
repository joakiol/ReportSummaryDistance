jpAbst rac tThe process of finding the antecedent of zeropronoun, that is indispensable to Japaneselanguage understanding, is the topic of thispaper.
Here we mainly concern with dis-courses comprising two sentences that are ina subordinate relation, especially one of themdescribes the agent's volitional action and theother describes the reason of the action.
Wepropose basically two new principles: (1) Theagent of an action should experience a certainpsychological reason, (2) Predicates report-ing someone's psychological state are catego-rized into 1) weakly or 2) strongly bound tothe expected point of view.
Combination ofthese principles accounts for some problem-atic Japanese zero anaphora, which cannotbe accounted for by the theories o far pro-posed.1 In t roduct ionKuno said in \[7\] that in Japanese discourseswe have to omit as many components in asentence as possible unless we get any ambi-guity.
In fact more components are omittedthan expected in actual discourses, becausewe have a rich variety of linguistic appara-tuses to be used to communicate unambigu-ously.
From the computational viewpointidentifying the antecedent of zero pronoun,which is the omitted part of sentence, is re-ally needed.
For this several theories havebeen developed.Among them we first review the two mostimportant theories in analyzing zero pro-noun's antecedent in Japanese proposed in80's.
The first one is Centering theory inJapanese proposed by Walker etal \[8\].Each utterance of a discourse has a set ofdiscourse ntities called forward looking cen-ters, Cf.
Cf's for one utterance are rankedaccording to their discourse sahence.
InJapanese Cf's are ranked in the following or-der of preference:TOPIC>EMPATHY>SUBJ>OBJ2>OBJNow we have the following constraints andrules to calculate the backward looking cen-ter, Cb, which is regarded as the most salientdiscourse entity picked up from Cf's of theprevious utterance.Constra ints  and RulesFor each Ui in a discourse segment UI,...,U,~1.
There is precisely one Cb.2.
Every dement of Cf(U;_I) must be realizedin Ui.
Notice that if the antecedent of zeropronoun in U; is known to be one of Cf(U;-1),then that Cf is regarded to be realized in Ui.3.
The center, Cb(Ui) , is the highest rankedelement of Cf(U;_I) that is realized in U;.4.
If some element of Cf(Ui_t) is reahzed asa pronoun in U;, then so is Cb(U/).5.
Transition states to decide Cb(Ui) are or-dered: Continuing is preferred to Retainingis preferred to Shifting-1 is preferred to Shift-ing.
These states are characterized asfollows.Here Cp(U~) means the highest ranked Cf(Ui).Continuing: Cb(U/_I) = Cb(Ui) = Cp(U/)Retaining: Cb(U,_I) = Cb(Ui) # Cp(Ui)Shifting-l: Cb(U,_t) # Cb(U,) = Cp(U,)Shifting: Cb(U;_~) # Cb(Ui) # Cp(Ui)Actually, the antecedent of zero pronounis determined under satisfying all these con-straints and rules.
This centering mecha-nism can account for a very broad range ofJapanese zero pronoun anaphora.
Almost thesame centering mechanism applies to Italianpronominal system successfully \[2\].Acr~ DB COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOl3"r 1992 3 2 4 PROC.

23-28, 1992Another important theory is Property shar-ing theory proposed by Kameyama \[4, 5\].
Hertheory concerns the interaction between Cband zero pronouns.
Consider adjacent ut-termaces or a sentence including a subordi-nated clause.
Two zero pronouns appearingdistinct utterances or clauses can retain thesame Cb if they share one of the followingproperties: 1) IDENT-SUBJECT, 2) IDENTalone, 3) SUBJECT alone, 4) bott, non-IDENT and non-SUBJECT, 5)non-IDENTonly, 6)non-SUBJ only, where the descend-ing order means preference, and IDENT isalmost the same as, or very near, the empa-thy proposed by Kuno \[7\].
Although thesetheories cover a fairly large part of Japanesezero anaphora resolution, there still remainthe problematic ases which can be resolvedby neither of them.
In the following sections,we will focus on some of the problematic casesand show how to deal with them.2 Interact ions betweenIra and KuretaWe begin with the following discourse.Alice ga Betty ni(1) Alice-SUBJ Betty-DNrCarol no koto woCaroI-GEN-NOM-ACCoshie-ta.inform- PAST' Alice informed Betty about Carol.
'~),~bj Carol no koto wo(I) -SUBJ CaroI-GEN-NOM-ACCsinpai si -ta karada.be anxious -PAST because'Because (\]),~bj was anxious about Carol.
'?,ubj "~" Alicewhere the last line, and henceforth, showsthat the native's intuitive interpretation isthat there being the only possible antecedentof the zero subject O,,,bj, and in this case, it isAlice.
Both the centering algorithm proposedby Walker etal \[1, 8\] and Kameyarua's property sharing constraint \[4, 5\] predict Alice msa strongly preferred antecedent of tt, e zerosubject, O,~bj, of (1).
So, they correctly pre-dict the native's intuition.
Let's look at thecase where the second sentence of (1) is re-placed with the following.~),ubj Carol no koto wo(2) ~-SUBJ  CaroI-GEN -NOM-ACCsinpai site -ita karada.be anxious being-PAST because~Beeause O),,bj was being anxious aboutCarol.
'\[q~,,bj = Betty\] > \[~)o,bj = Alice\]where the last line of the above example,and henceforth, indicates the native's intu-ition of the order of preference for antecedentsof ?0~bj in ease we have more than one possi-ble antecedents.In (2) both Alice and Betty are the possi-ble antecedent of ?,~bj, even though Betty isstronger.
Both Betty and Alice can be de-rived by the theory in \[8\].
However, sinceAlice is subject, their theory predicts thatAlice is the prinrary candidate of antecedentof/l),ubj.This is explained by the well known factthat "ita"-sufllx, which is used in the secondsentence in this case, describes the event froman outsider's point of view, which, presum-ably, makes the antecedent of zero subjectof "ita"-suilixed verb not be the linguisticallysalient expressions, in this case, the subject ofthe first sentence but be some other person.Therefore the zero subject ~?~bj tends not tocorefer with the subject of the first utteranceAlice which is a linguistically salient expres-sion.
As the result #,~j  tends to corefer withBetty.
Basically this explanation comes fromKameyama's accounts in \[4\].Look at the discourses whose first sentencesare the saute as the tlrst sentence of (1) andsecond sentences are the following sentencesrespectively, in which each of the second sen-tences describes not a psychological state buta physical action of meeting.

1992'Because 49,~b./was meeting Carol at thestation yesterday.
'\[49?,b~ = Betty\] _> \[49,,bj = Alice \]Nevertheless the contents described in the Thesecond sentences are categorically different is:ones, these two series of discourses, ay (1)(2)and (3)(4) respectively, show the similar pref-erences for ?,,bj.
Therefore the tentativesummarization of preference mechanism sofar is the following.Pr inc ip le  1 (Preference(tentative))Consider a discourse of two sentences or acomplex sentence in which one of the sen-tence or clause describes the action taken byan agent, and the other sentence or clauseprovides the reason of the action respectively.i .
As a default, a zero subject of one sen- (8)fence or clause that describe the rea-son corefers with the subject of the othersentence (clause) unless there is a non-subject topic in the other sentence (orclause).2.
When "ita"-sufflxed verb is used in onesentence or clause that describes the rea-son, their zero subjects tend not to core-fer with the (topic} subject of the othersentence ( or clause}.3 ProblematicCases, " i ta-morat-ta"CombinationLet's compare the following three discourseswhich consist of two sentences respectively,and whose first sentences are common oneshown as follows:Betty ga Alice ni(5) Betty-SUBJ Alice-bATCarol no koto woCaroI-GEN-NOM-ACCoshiete -morat-ta.inform -CAUS-PAST'Betty i let Alice inform herl aboutCarol.

'\[49,,bj = Alice\] > \[49,,sS = Betty\]These discourses all have the same "morat-ta" -suffixed and "ita "-suffixed verbs followedby "karada" cornbination in the first andthe second sentence respectively.
In "oshie-te-morat-ta", "(te)-morat" causativizes theverb, namely the agent of the action of askingsome action to other one is the antecedent ofthe subject, and, the more important pointis that "morat-ta"-suffaxed verb describes theaction from the subject's point of vicw.
Asthe result, in these discourses the empathy lo-cus of the first sentence is Betty.
While theyare almost identical in grammatical struc-tures, the preferred antecedents of zero sub-ject (I),~b./ are quite different.
Therefore thisdifference is expected to comc from the con-tents of verb phrase of the second sentences.First we consider the preference of zero sub-ject based on "morat-ta"- "ita" combination.Since Betty  is not only the subject but alsothe empathy locus of the first sentence, and"ita"-suffixed verb describes the event fromthe outsider's view point, namely, from non-empathy locus, Alice should be preferred asthe antecedent of zero subject of the secondsentence.
Although this expectation coin-cides with the actual preference of (8), it doesnot with that of (6) or (7).
This discrepancycannot be explained by any syntactic theory,ACI'ES DE COL1NG-92.

23-28, 1992because (6), (7) arid (8), all have the iden-tical syntactic structure.
Neither the pro-posed centering theories \[1, 8, 4, 5\] nor ourtentative preference principle 1 can accountfor this phenomena.
The reason is that (1)timy use only the notions of topic, empathy,and the effect of 'Sta" and "morat-t?
'-suffix,(2) all these discourses are the same in thesenotions and suffixes.
To explain this discrep-ancy, hopefully, in more unified fashion in or-der to be able to apply the resulting theoryto a variety of cases, is the real aim of thepaper.4 Experiencer and Agentof ActionIt is cognitively reasonable to assume thatwhen a human agent akes a volitional actionit should be the case that the agent has a cer-tain psychological reason.
This assumption isexemplified, for instance, in the following dis-course.
(9)John wa \[?,~b inu; gaJohn-TP-SB \[(1) -SUBJ dog i -OBJkowakat4a node \]fear-PAST because \]~obj,~ oi harat-ta.
(I); -OBJ make-PAST away'Because John feared the dog~, he madeitl away.
'~,,a, = JohnClearly and intuitively the antecedent ofzero subject of the subordinated clause isJohn who is the topic subject of main clause.The subject of the main clause should havethe psychological reason of iris volitional ac-tion, oi harat (= make (I) away , (where= the dog) ), and the subordinated clausestates that John experienced a certain fear.The intuition of John being the antecedent ofthe zero subject supports the assumption thatthe agent nmst have the psychological reason.In other words, the agent of his/her volitionalaction must be an experieneer of the psycho-logical state which should be the reason forthat action.
On the contrary in the followingdiscourse the agent of the action, boku ( -  I),is not identical with the experiencer of fear,say, John.
Its unacceptability endorses theabove assumption.\[ John ga inu wo(10) * \[ John-SB dog-OBJkowakat-ta node \] boku gafear-PAST because \] I-SUBJ~b~ oi harat-ta.-OBJ make-PAST away'Because John feared the dogl, I made it;away.
'?obj = inu(=the dog)However if John's fearing can be recognizedby some other person through observing it,and the agent of the action coincides with thisperson, the discourse is acceptable as exem-plified in the following examl)le.
(11)\[ John ga inul wo kowakat-ta\[ John-SB dog; -OBJ fear-PASTyou-na node \] boku gaseem because \] I-SUB~obj,; oi harat -ta.?
; -OBJ make away -PAST'Becanse John seemed to fear the dogi, Imade it; away.
'In this case "you-rid' used in the subordi-nated clause makes John's fearing ("kowakat-ta") state t)e observed from not John butsome other not yet specified person, say, X.Actually after reading the main clause, weknow that the.
agent of the action is the malespeakcr, 1 (= boku), and can infer that theobserver X coincides with I consistently t)eocause X haz not yet had any particular efer-eat.
That is why (l 1) is acceptable.
And thisacceptability is accounted h)r by the aboveassumption.
Through the careful examina-tion about the actual discourses, we also con-firmed that all these kind of phenomena arecorrectly ot)served even in the case that twoconsecutive sentences are in a subordinationrelation, say, one describes an action takenby the agent attd the other gives the reasonof that action.
Now we have conlirmed theassumption posed at the beginning of thissection with some elaborations done in theprevious lines, so we state it ~.s the followingprinciple.Def in i t ion 1 (Exper iencer )  Ezperienceris defined as a person who directly experiences.

1992Definit ion 2 (Observer) Observer is de-fined as a person who, from his/her point ofview, recognizes some other experieneer's p y-chological state by observing that experieneer.Principle 2 (Agent is Exp.
or Obs.
)Consider a discourse in which the subordi-nated sentence (or clause) expresses apsycho-logical reason of the volitional action taken byan agent which main sentence (or clause) de-scribes.
The agent who takes the volitionalaction should be either the experiencer or ob-server of the situation described in the subor-dinated sentence (or clause).This principle, superficially, seems to be akind of commonsense inference rule.
How-ever, since it comes from the very nature ofhuman behavior so deeply, it should be re-garded as the control hueristics in cognition.Now we restate the effect of "ita"-suflix interms of this principle.
Consider the followingexamples.
(12) * \[ Bill wa onaka ga sui-taBill-TPoSB be-PAST hungrynode \] boku wabecause \] I-SUBJhitokire no pan wo yat-ta.a piece of bread-OBJ give-PAST'Because Bill was hungry, I gave him apiece of bread.
'This sentence is unacceptable or at mostmarginal because of discrepancy of the agentof action and the experiencer.
In Japanese,even if we consider an observer, he/she couldnot be the agent of action when the experi-ence, for instances being hungry or being sad,is not observable from outsiders \[6\].
Howeverif we replace verb "sui-ta" with ira-suffixedone, "suite-its", shown in the following, Bill'shunger is known to be observed from otherperson, in this case Boku(= I) who coincideswith the agent of action of giving a piece ofbread.
So it does not violate Principle 2.
Ac-tually the following (13) is acceptable underthis interpretation.\[ Bill wa onaka ga suite-its(13) \[ Bill-TP-SB be-PAST being hungrynode \] Boku gabecause \] I-SBhitokire no pan wo yat-ta.a piece of bread-OBJ give-PAST'Because Bill was being hungry, I gavehim a piece of bread.
'In conclusion, '~ita'-suflix makes the eventbe described from some outsider's point ofview.
Therefore by identifying that outsiderwith the agent of action, the agent becomesto be the observer of the state which is thereason of his/her vohtional action.One of the important issues about Prin-ciple 2 is the relation among this principle,Kameyama's property sharing and the cen-tering algorithm \[8\].
At first glance Princi-ple 2 is exemplified linguistically by subject-empathy( 'ident' in her term ) sharing \[5\],or by the combination of preference for Cb(Backward Looking Center ) continuing andCf Ranking \[8\].
Actually sometimes it is thecase.
However Principle 2 is based on thevery nature of human behavior.
Therefore itgenerally provides more indirect explanationsthan their theories do.
But even in the casestheir theories do not provide a correct andunique prediction, like (6), (7) and (8), Prin-ciple 2 would provide a certain guideline aswill be shown in the following section.5 Typo logy  of  Pred icatesIt's time to explain the discrepancy of inter-pretations of (6), (7) and (8) noted in sec-tion 3.Before mlalyzing (6), (7) and (8), we ex-amine the minimal pairs of these in whichnon "ita"-suffixed verbs are used in the sec-ond sentences, like the followings:(14)(15)(16)(I) ,ubj Kinou eki de(I) -SUBJ yesterday station-LOCCarol to at-ta karada.Carol-OBJ meet-PAST because'Because ?,,bj met Carol at the stationyesterday.

,,,bj = BettyIn all cases, the antecedent of the zero sub-ject is Betty who is the agent of 'qetting herinform" action described in the first sentence(5).
This fact is one of the consequences de-rived by Principle 2.
Anyway we can regardBetty as the expected point of view, hence-forth called POV, in the second sentences,say, above shown (14), (15) and (16) and alsoin previously shown (6), (7) and (8).
As theconsequence Betty is expected to be the pri-mary candidate of antecedent of zero subject?,~bi in all these cases.Now we start to examine the original cases.First we examine (8).Verb "au" ( meet in English), the stem ofthe verb "atte" used in (8), could describe themeeting event from the outside of the agentwho is actually meeting.
In other words ameeting action is observed from the peoplearound as well as the agent him/herself.
Frmnthe first sentence (5) we know that the agentof volitional action is Betty who should havethe reason of the action in the situation de-scribed by the second sentence.
In this easethe "ita"-suflix is strong enough to take thenon-agent outsider's point of view, namelyAlice.
As a result Alice took the meeting ac-tion and Betty was to be an observer.
Sinceit coincides with the intuitive preference, andthis account relies on Principle 2, we onceagain confirm that principle, llowever thepreferences of the previously shown (6) and(7) are, at first glance, the counter examplesof the combination of Principle 2 and the lin-guistic force of "ita"-suttix.Therefore we have to try to find anotherreason to explain these phenomena.
We donot have any syntactic clue to explain thedifference of their I)references, because theyare syntactically almost the same.
The nextthing we should examine is the contents ofverb phrase in the second sentences.
Throughcareful examining of number of verbs and socalled "subjective adjectives" 1 in sentencesof this type of structure, we found inductivelythat they are categorized into at least threegroups ms the followings.tFor instance, "Kmtasii"(be sad) is regarded as asubjective adjective in Japanese.Pr inc ip le  3 (Predicates Categorization)2POV Neut ra l  Verb "au" used in (8) is ofthis type.
This type of verb describes aphysical action which can be describedeasily and naturally \[rom the point ofview of anyone around the agent of thisaction, of course including the agenthim/herself.
As the consequence, theagent of the action described by this typeof verb can be interpreted fully under thecontrol of "ita"-suJJix' s force.Weak POV Bound Verb "sinpai-suru" (beanxious) used in (6) is of this type.
Thistype of verb describes tile psychologicalstate of the agent who takes a volitionalaction, primarily from the expected pointof view, namely that agent.
Howeverthat state can be observed by other peo-ple.
As a result, it is possible to de-scribe the agent's psychological state ei-ther from the expected current point ofview or fi'om the outside observers.Strong POV Bound Verb "kininaru" (feelanxiety) used in (7), so called subjec-tive adjectives, that express a psycho-logical state~ like "ureshi-i"(be happy),"kanashi-i" (be sad}, "X-wo-kanziru" (feelX) where X is a noun which representsa certain psychological state, and so onare oJ this type.
This type of predicatedescribes an agent's inner psychologicalstate that cannot be observed by otherpeople.
As a result, they describe thosestates exclusively fi'om tile expected cur?rent point of view, who is to be the agentof the action.By combining this categorization and Prin-ciple 2 we can account for the discrepancy ofpreference among (6), (7) and (8) as follow-ing.The preference of (8) has been already ac-counted for in this section, which actuallyuses the nature of POV Neutral Verb, "au".2The dill'create similar with that of between Weaka:nd Strong POV Bound predicates has already beenobserved inthe context of antecedent binding throughJapanese long distance reflexive 'zibun' hi terms ofthree notions, say, SOURCE, SELF and PIVOT byIida and Sells \[3\].
Kinsui \[6\] proposes the frameworkthat categorizes aapaalese v rbs aatd subjective adjec-tives into the similar types as ours.Ac'll~s DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~" 1992 3 2 9 PROC.
OF COLING-92, NANTES, Air6.23-28, 1992Notice that due to the first sentence (5) theagent of volitional action "oshie-te-morat"(let her inform) is known to be Betty whoshould have the reason of the action in thesituation described by the second sentence(6).
By Principle 2 (6) describes Betty's ex-perience that causes her volitional causativeaction "oshie-te-morat?'
As a result theantecedent of the zero subject is primarilyBetty.
However since verb "sinpal-suru"(bearudous) of (6) is Weak POV Hound, dueto the effect of "ita"-suffix, it is also pos-sible that non agent, in this case Alice, isthe antecedent of the zero subject.
Namely,by '~ita"-suffix Alice's state of being anxious("sinpai suru') is known to be observed bythe original agent Betty.
Thus the intuitivepreference is accounted for by the combina-tion of Principle 2, "sinpai-suru" being WeakPOV Bound, and the effect of "ita"-suffix.As described in the above ease, Betty isknown to be the salient agent in the secondsentence (7).
However since the verb of (7)"kininaru" is Strong POV Bound, the zerosubject is exclusively the expected point ofview, namely the primarily supposed agentBetty even though the verb is "ita'-snflixed.Thus we account for native's intuitive prefer-ence systematically.Intrasentential c ses are also accounted forin the same fashion as we did in the discoursecases.
However we omit those due to thespace limitation.6 Conc lus ionsThe centering algorithms already proposedaccount for much broader ange of phenom-ena than our theory covers.
However theiralgorithms themselves cannot account for cer-tain types of phenomena, which we observe inreason-action type subordinated iscourses,etc.
These cases can be dealt with by Princi-ple 2 and predicate categorization especiallyStrong and Weak POV Bound types as statedin the following principle.Pr inciple 4 In the subordinated sentence orclause whose verb describes the ezperiencer'spsychological state and is Weak PO V Bound,as .\[or the antecedent of zero pronoun, thenon-experiencer expected by the force of "ira"-suffixed verb and by Principle ~ can overridethe supposed experiencer.
In eases of StrongPO V Bound this overriding does not happen.Incorporating with these principles, the al-ready proposed centering theories could covermuch wider zero anaphora phenomena.AcknowledgmentsI would like to thank Prof. Takao Gunji, Prof.Tal~si Iida, Dr. Megumi K~rneyama, Dr. Ya~suhiro Katagiri, Prof. Satoshi Kinsui, Prof.Yukinori Takubo, Prof. Syn Tutiya for theirhelpful comments.
