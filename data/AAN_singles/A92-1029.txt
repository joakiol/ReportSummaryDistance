Compound Nouns  in a Un i f i ca t ion -Based  MT SystemPierrette Bouillon Katharina BoesefeldtISSCO, 54 route des Acacias1227 Geneva, Switzerlandpb~divsun.unlge.chGraham RussellAbstractThis paper describes an approach to thetreatment of nominal compounds in a ma-chine translation project employing a modernunification-based system.General problems connected with the analy-sis of compounds are briefly reviewed, and theproject, for the automatic translation of Swissavalanche bulletins, is introduced.
Avalanchebulletins deal with a limited semantic domainand employ a sublanguage in which nominalcompounds occur frequently.
These and otherproperties of the texts affect the treatment ofcompounds, permitting certain simplifications,while leaving a number of possible alternativeanalyses.We discuss the different problems involvingthe translation of compounds between Germanand French, and show how the computationalenvironment in use permits two different ap-proaches to the problem: an interlingua-basedapproach and a transfer-based approach.
Fi-nally, wc evaluate these approaches with re-spect to linguistic and computational consider-ations applicable in a MT-system dealing witha limited semantic domain and describe the so-lution that has actually been implemented.1 Compound NounsCompound words pose well-known problems for linguis-tic description in general, and some additional ones fornatural language processing in particular:Identification: how can compounds be distinguishedfrom other words and phrases?Segmentation: what are the components of a com-pound?
In many languages, including German, ortho-graphic convention is such that compounds are writ-ten as single units.
IDisambiguation: what is the correct analysis of a com-pound?
On the widespread assumption that com-pounds have a recursive binary structure, any occur-rences with more than two basic elements will ad-1Elements of German compounds may however be sepa-rated by the so-called "Fugenseichen" (8, en, etc.
).mit multiple analyses, 2 from which, normally, a singlecandidate must be selected.Interpretation: how can the meaning of a compoundword be derived from the meanings of its parts?
Formany purposes, there is little point in performing anyof the other tasks unless this is feasible.It is clear that solutions to these four problems may beclosely interrelated; ill-formed interpretations may per-mit unwanted analyses to be filtered out, the correctanalysis will constrain possible segmentations, and soon.In what follows, we outline an approach to the treat-ment of compounds within a specific limited application,the automatic translation of Swiss avalanche warningbulletins, which exploits the nature of the texts involvedin order to translate compounds efficiently and correctly.We first give a brief overview of the project, payingspecial attention to phenomena related to compoundsand their translation.
We then describe ELU, 3 the soft-ware employed for translation, and discuss a number ofthe different treatments that it permits, motivating ourchoice of analysis with illustrations of their weak andstrong points.2 Compounds in Avalanche BulletinsThe avalanche bulletins are issued by IFENA (the Fed-eral Institute for the Study of Snow and Avalanches) 4 anumber of times a week during the winter season, the ex-act frequency of their appearance depending on weatherconditions.
Bulletins are prepared in German, and aretranslated into the other official Swiss languages, Frenchand Italian, before publication.
The current state of af-fairs, in which the source language is exclusively Ger-man, may change in future, and for this reason it hasbeen decided to implement a reversible system (Bouillonand Boesefeldt, 1991a; Bouillon and Boesefeldt, 1991b).Avalanche bulletins describe a fixed and specifiablesemantic domain, and employ a language restricted inboth vocabulary and syntactic variety.
They contain alarge number of compounds, with differing grammatical2See Church and Patil (1982: p.
140ff.)
for discussion.3"Envizonnement Linguistique d'Unification" (Estival,1990).
See also Johnson and Rosner (1989) for a descriptionof the earlier UD system on which ET.u is based.4The project is partially supported by IFENA.209properties.
It is the interpretation of compounds, to-gether with the closely related issue of structural disam-biguation, which most researchers have addressed (Finin,1980; Isabelle, 1984; Sparck Jones, 1983).
In an ap-plication such as avalanche bulletin translation, how-ever, the necessity for a deep or sophisticated analy-sis of compound meanings is not obvious.
On the onehand, the number of compounds appearing in the sub-language is highly restricted (approximately 400); theymay therefore be listed exhaustively, and the questionof disambiguation does not arise.
And on the other,the interpretation of a compound is given by its estab-lished translation - the meaning of Lawinengefahr ('dan-ger of avalanches') is just the information ecessary toproduce the required target language xpression dangerd'avalanches (or pericolo di valanghe, etc.
).In the current system, the main difficulty thus consistsof establishing a systematic and general relation betweensingle words in German and complex nominal structuresin French, without defining the semantic and pragmaticroles of the different parts of the compound.2.1 Var ia t ion  in German CompoundsA purely categorial analysis of the German compoundnouns contained in the avalanche warning bulletins re-veals the following internal combinations of nouns, ad-jectives, verbs and prepositions:\[ADJ N\] Neuschnee'new snow'\[N N\] Lawinengefahr'danger of avalanches'\[V N\] Schwimmschnee'floating snow'IN \[ADJ N\]\] Alpensgdhang'southern slope of the Alps'\[\[ADJ N\] r~\] geuschneezuwachs'increase in new snow'\[Iv N\] N\] Schwimmsehneebildung'development of floating snow'\[\[N N\] N\] Schneebrettgefahr'danger of snow patches'\[\[PREP N\] N\] Uberschneesprengung'explosion above the snow'The 'head' of a compound is its final constituentwhich determines its properties (in the examples above,-schnee, -gefahr, -zuwachs, etc.
), and may itself be a com-pound (-sgdhang, for example).
Constituents of a com-pound are not inflected, although, naturally, the com-pound as a whole may be.There is a very strong tendency to restrictthe length of compounds to three elementary con-stituents; of approximately 400 compound nouns inthe bulletins, issued over the past few years, onlyone (Naflschneelawinengefahr: 'danger of wet-snowavalanches') contains four.
s Complex meanings thatSThis distribution can also be found in other domains(Boesefeldt, 1989) as well as in general language (Fleischer,1982).might be expressed by a fourth element within a com-pound generally occur in the form of a noun taking thecompound as complement (e.g.
Abgang yon Naflschnee-lawinen, literally: 'going-down of wet-snow avalanches')~or conventional djectival modification (e.g.
sehr gross~allgemeine Schneebre~tgefahr 'very great general dange~of snow patches').2.2 The  F rench  Trans la t ionCompound nouns in the German original texts are usu-ally translated into French as complex nominal phrase.,containing adjectival or prepositional subparts (e.gNeuschnee: neige frafche; Schneebre~gefahr: danger d~plaques de neige).
The details of translation differ innumber of aspects.
First of all, the French phrases do notalways contain the same syntactic ategories as the cot.responding German compounds.
The noun-noun com-pound Oberflachenschicht ('surface layer'), for instanceis generally translated by the sequence of noun and post.nominal adjective couches uperficielles.Secondly, prepositions within French translations o:German compounds vary from case to case: Schneebrettgefahr is translated as danger de plaques de neigeSchneeraster as grille d_ neige and Lawinenforschung a,.recherche su_.._Er les avalanches.
The use of articles withixthese PPs also varies: tempdra~ure de la neige ('snovtemperature') has the definite article, while quan~i~d d~neige ('snow quantity') has none.
Even though the us~of the different prepositions and articles might contaiiclues concerning the possible semantic and pragmatic re.lation between the different elements of the compound,(d denoting an instrument, an omitted article an abstraclor partitive, etc.
), the size of the corpus (only about 100(words including nouns, verbs, articles etc.)
makes it impossible to draw any general conclusion which could bqimplemented.Finally, certain parts of German compounds arqsystematically omitted from the corresponding Frenclphrase: Schneebret~anrifl ('rupture of a snow patch'translates as rupture de plaque, where the word neigdoes not appear.3 The  t reatment  o f  compounds  w i thELUSince 1990, the ELU system has been used at ISSCO fothe implementation of a machine translation system foSwiss avalanche warning bulletins (Boesefeldt and Bouillon, 1991; Bouillon and Boesefeldt, 1991a; Bouillon antBoesefeldt, 1991b).
ELU is a unification-based grammar development environment in the style of PATR-I(Shieber, 1986), designed especially for experimentatio\]with machine translation.ELU is composed of three modules: a parser, a generator and a reversible transfer module.
Since it is th,last of these that chiefly concerns us here, we shall sa:nothing about the parser or generator.
ELU supportvarious methods of translation.
By writing grammarthat share meaning representations, one may implemenan interlingua-based system; the result of analysingsource-language text is used directly as the basis for gen210erating the target-language text, and transfer is unneces-sary.
At the other extreme, ELU transfer ules are capa-ble of performing arbitrary transformations on an inputstructure, and thus permit whatever variety of transferthe user desires.
?
A transfer-based approach to transla-tion has been selected for the current project.Transfer ules are written which state binary relationsover the representations of texts from the source andtarget languages o as to associate the analysis of onelanguage with the synthesis of another.
There are twokinds of transfer rule, treating atomic and complex fea-ture structures.
For example, the following two FSs, rep-resenting the German phrase die Ge/ahr and its Frenchequivalent le danger,DETYPB definite L DBTYPE definiteare related by means of the following four rules::TA: gefahr  danger:TA: def in i te  de f in i te:T: pred :T: detype:LI: <* pred>= X :LI: <* detype> = X:L2: <* prod> = Y :L2: <* detype> = Y:X: X = Y :X: X = YThe transfer rules establish a relation between thepairs of atoms gefahr  - danger  and def in i te  - defi-n i te  as the values of the attributes PRED and DETYPZ inthe two representations.
The rules pred  and detype ab-stract away from the particular values which their pathsmay take; a statement of the form " :g:  g = Y" indi-cates that the success of the rule in which it appears isconditional on the success of other rules involving what-ever structures are bound to X and Y during the transferprocess.
Transfer of a FS thus proceeds recursively, be-ginning with the root, and, provided that no failure oc-curs, terminating with the atoms which form the 'leaves'of the FS.
For further details, see Estival et ai.
(1990)and Russell e ta l .
(1991).Two broad classes of solutions suggest hemselves forthe treatment of compounds in ELU: one, interlingua-oriented (cf.
Section 3.2), in which the representations inthe two languages are broadly similar, as in the Gefahr- danger example, and the other exploiting more fullythe transfer mechanism (cf.
Section 3.1).
In the formercase, it is possible to pass from a German compound toa complex French nominal phrase by employing eneraltransfer rules of the kind required by other aspects ofthe translation task, while in the latter, different repre-sentations are related by complex transfer ules specificto the treatment of compounds.3.1 The  t rans fer -based  approachAt first view, the transfer-based approach seems to bethe more natural.O,,Codescription, analyses of the type proposed by Kaplanet al (1989) are also possible.In German, compounds can be introduced in the lexi-con as simple words and treated in the same way by thegrammar.
The NP eine Schneebrettgefahr, for example,will be represented by a feature structure similar to thatprovided for the simple eine Gefahr.
The semantics ofadjectival modifiers is encoded as elements in a list, sincethe number of these may vary.
Lists are indicated inattribute-value diagrams by ' ( .

\] '; those shown here are empty:PRED schneebrettgefahx"DETYPE indefinite~oD ( >PRED gefahr \]DETYPE indefiniteMOD < }The French grammar constructs the translation of aGerman compound from individual words, the head ofthe phrase being lexically specified for its complementand/or modifiers.
For example, danger subcategorizesfor a PP headed by the preposition de, and contain-ing a NP which lacks an article and whose head nounis one of a class that includes plaques.
The represen-tation constructed for the French equivalent danger deplaques de neige will be considerably more complex thanthe German, with sub-FSs relating to the head (danger)and complement, which itself will be a complex struc-ture with information concerning a head (plaques) andcomplement (neige).
Since the prepositions in these con-structions are determined by the lexieal properties of thenouns, they convey no information in these eases, and donot appear in the representation, the French grammaraccounts for their correct distribution.r nei e\]ARGS I DETYPE non \[LMOD <} JARGS I PILED plaquesI DETYPE nonLMOD < >PRED dangerDETYPE indefinite~ov ( )This technique makes it necessary to write a trans-fer rule for every compound in order to pass from theGerman compound to the different French words::T::LI::L2::I:Schneebrettgefahr<* pred>= schneebrettgefahr<* args args pred>= neige<* args args detype> = non<* axgs axgs mod> = \[\]<* args pred>= plaques<* args detype> = non<* args rood> = \[\]<* prod> = dangerIt presents a number of disadvantages.
In the first place,certain generalizations which we consider important can-not be taken into account.
For example, an elementmay appear in a number of different compounds, andthe same information has to be repeated in each case.211For every compound including Gebiet ('region'), for ex-ample, we have to repeat the fact that the noun Gebie~translates as rdgion::T ::L I ::L2:Simplongebiet<* pred> = simplongebiet<* args pred> = simplon<* args detype> = non<* args mod> = \[\]<* pred> = region:T::LI::L2:Engadingebiet<* pred> = enEadinEebiet<* ares pred> = enEadine<* ares detype> = non<* ares mod> = \[\]<* pred> = regionMoreover, as this term also exists as a simple word, wealso have to add a transfer ule to translate the simpleword::TA: geb ie t  regionNo account is taken of the fact that the elements in-side the compounds correspond to isolated words andtranslate in the same way; moreover, a larger number oftransfer rules is required, which, in turn, decreases theefficiency of the system.The use of this technique leads to an additional prob-lem.
It is possible to add an adjective to a com-pound which already contains an adjective, e.g.
ganzeAIpensCzdhang ('whole southern slope of the Alps').
Thisphrase has the following representation:I PRBD alpensudhang 1MOD ( g~z ) JThe representation of equivalent French expression ~outle versant sud des Alpes, however, is as follows:\[P. D .Jpes \]ARGS I DETYPE definiteL MOD ( )I PRED vezsantL MOD ( tout ,  sud )For the transfer between the two languages it is neces-sary to establish a relation between the dements insidethe lists.
We cannot be sure, however, that the adjectivewhich is a part of the German compound will alwaysbe at the same place inside the list in French.
For thisreason, it was decided to distinguish within the Frenchdescription between adjectives which compose in Ger-man and adjectives which do not.
This distinction whichmight seem undesirable at first sight has been proved sat-isfactory and generalizable for the sublanguage we treatand could be quite easily established.An  adjective cannot be found inside a German com-pound if it is part of a coordination, if it is modified byan adverb, if it has a particular morphological suffix orif it is a participle which is used adjectivally, if it hasbeen given a certain semantic type 7 (adjectives qualify-ing snow always compose, adjectives expressing a degreeof danger never compose), if there already is another ad-jective inside the compound or if the compound containsmore than three elements.
In all these cases it will there-fore become the value of the path MOD : NOM and notthe value of the new path MOD : N_COMP.The representation of the nominal phrase ~out le ver-san~ sud des AIpes is then modified as follows:I  pes \]ARGS |DETYPE defmlte|L MOD ( ) J~ PRED versantl MOD \[NOM tout 1LN_CO~ sud JThe attribute MOD has thus been subdivided into twoparts, MOP : NOM for adjectives like ~ou~ that do notcompose and MOD : N_COMP for adjectives like sud thatdo compose.The transfer rules for the transfer between ganzeAIpens~dhang and the French ~o~ le versant sud desAlpes can then be simplified and made more general:: T : Alpensudhan E:L I :  <* pred> = alpensudhan E: L2 :  <* ares  pred> = a lpes<* ares  detype> = non<* ares mod> = \[\]<* mod n comp> = sud<* prect> = versant: l :  -:T :  nom:L I :  <*  mod nom> = X1:L2: <* mod nom> = X2:X :  X l  = X2:Ta: ganz toutThis technique has been successfully implemented andwas the first step towards the second solution to be pre-sented here, the interlingua-oriented solution.3.2 An  interllngua-orlented approachIn order to obtain the same representation in Germanand in French, the German compounds have to be as-signed in the lexicon a complex representation in whichthe word is semantically decomposed into head and com-plement(s).
Moreover, certain information concerningthe internal structure of the French compounds has tobe added to the German representation during the anal-ysis.
This process can be clone quite easily in ELU bymeans of macros, s The desired structures need only tobe defined once, the adequate values being instantiatedat the place of the variables.rLexical items are typed according to the contexts inwhich they may appear.SET.u macros resemble a more powerful version of PATR-II 'templates', permitting the use of arguments, and multipleor recursive definitions.212The NP Alpens~dhang will thus receive the same rep-resentation as its French equivalent:PRED alpen \]definite ~IIG S \[ DETYPB I \]L MOp \[ N_COMP (LNoM (PRED hang\[ PRED a\]pes \]definiteI\] \[Mo  < LNOM (PRED versantThe  paths ARGS : MOD : NOM and ARGS : DZTYPE in  theGerman representation have been added because theyare added by grammar ules constituting French NPsand PPs.This technique makes it possible to simplify the trans-fer rules, which can then be used for the transfer of notonly compounds, but also other items:: T : ncomp:LI: <* mod n_comp> = X1:L2: <* mod n_comp> = X2:X: Xl = X2:T: nom:LI: <* mod nom> = X1:L2: <* mod nom> = X2:X: X1 = X2:T: pred:LI: <* pred> = X1:L2: <* pred> = X2:X: X1 = X2:T: args:LI: <* args> = X1:L2: <* args> = X2:X: X1 = X2:T: detype:LI: <* detype> = Xl:L2: <* detype> = X2:X: X1 = X2:TA: alpen alpes:TA: hang versant:TA: sud sud:TA: definite definiteThe semantic decomposition of the German com-pounds not only decreases the number of transfer ules,but a/so makes the transfer more general and coherent,as the different elements of a compound are translatedas simple words.The first problem of this technique consists of decidingwhat complex semantic representation to give Germancompounds.
The decomposition could be performed ac-cording to the categories in either German or the targetlanguage.
A disadvantage of the former is that, for thereasons given in section 2.2, transfer ules for irregularcases must be added.
The latter approach avoids thisdifficulty by assigning the noun-noun compound Son-nenlagen ('sunny places'), for example, a representationin which the contribution of the element sonnen- and-lage are classified as modifier and predicate respectively,rather than predicate and argument:PRED lage \]MOD \[ NOM < ) lL N_COMP ( sonnig ) JThis representation corresponds to the representation forthe French equivalent, endroit ensoleilld:I PRED endroit \]\[.oM < > 1LN-COMP ( ensoleil\]~ ) \]As sonnig is not the value of the path MOD : NOM, thisrepresentation does not interfere with the representationof the possible nominal phrase sonnige Lage:\[._ ,.,.MOD \[NOM < so~igLN-COMP < )But there is another reason to treat the irregulari-ties between German and French in the German lexicon.Two different words can also be used as synonyms in-side and outside of a compound (e.g.
Grisons is trans-lated by Graub~nden i  German, but Grisons nord istranslated by Nordb~inden and not by Nordgraub~nden).Nordb~nden has therefore been assigned a representationsuitable for the generation of the French nominal phrase,nord des Grisons:| DETYPB definite ARGSLl.O D/ < LN-Co~ <PRED nord/ DETYPE definiteLMDD F N?M ( \[N_oo~ <PRED nordThis representation for the German compound, however,does not seem very satisfactory because it would be nec-essary to write a special atomic transfer ule in additionto the transfer ule for Graub~nden::TA: bunden grisons:TA: graubunden grisons213Moreover, this would introduce an unwanted ambigu-ity when translating from French into German, since theFrench Grisons would now be related to both B~ndenand Graubgnden.
Nordbgnden is therefore assigned arepresentation in which nord and Graubgnden are relatedas shown here:\[ PR.BD graubunden \]definite/ I\] ( L N-COZ~ <PPd~D nordChanges to lexical specifications can be made very easilyby altering the value of the relevant path in the lexiconentry, without affecting the surface form of the lexicaiitem.Similarly, certain parts of the German compound haveto be eliminated from the representation i  the case ofFrench nominal phrases in which certain parts of theGerman compound have been excluded (cf.
section 2.2).This technique, however, cannot be applied if a com-pound without the element hat is missing in Frenchexists in German because the same French representa-tion would then lead to the generation of two differentnominal phrases in German.In a number of cases the content of a compound canalso be expressed by a complex nominal phrase withonly slight stylistic differences (Fleischer, 1982: p. 20-21).
The semantic representation used for compounds,however, is also used to express complex NPs in German;these constructions are also translated into French nomi-nal phrases.
In constrast to the case of adjectives withincompound, which are assigned a special path in the rep-resentation (MOD : N_COMP), a complex NP in German,e.g.
Abgang yon Lawinen ('going-down of avalanches')will get the following representation:PRED lawinen \]ARGS \[DETYPE indefinlte I\]L NCOl~ (PRBD abgangwhich is the same as the representation for the com-pound Lawinenabgang, containing exactly the same in-formation.
In order to avoid over-generation resultingfrom the same representation being used for two differentsyntactic onstructions, the possible syntactic structuresin German have been restricted.Analysis of the corpus of avalanche bulletin textsbrought to light two types of case in which the samerepresentation could be obtained for a compound anda complex NP.
In the first, a fourth element either ap-pears with a compound in a complex NP or has beenincluded as an element of the compound itself.
As bothconstructions contain exactly the same information, itwas decided to eliminate the second possibility, and al-low no more than three elements within a compound.For example, the word Naflschneelawinengefahr ('dangerof wet snow avalanches') which is sometimes used insteadof Gefahr yon Naflschneelawinen does not appear in thelexicon, and the phrasal version is used instead.It was also observed that, according to the degreeof lexicaiisation, nouns originally derived from a verbsuch as Abgang can form a part of a compound (e.g.Neuschneeablagerung - 'deposit of wet snow') as wellas a part of a nominal phrase (e.g.
Verfesiigung derSchneedecke - 'consolidation of the snow cover').
As nogeneral syntactic rule could be found to deal with thisphenomenon it was decided to treat it on a case by casebasis according to the occurrence of derived nouns in theavalanche bulletins.The restrictions introduced into the German gram-mar, which are due to general language tendencies as wellas to the language used in the avalanche bulletins, thusmake it possible to avoid over-generation for Germancompounds without introducing an additional path forcomplex NPs.
In case of the sublanguage we are treat-ing, semantic decomposition therefore does not compli-cate the transfer as it is carried out according to therequirements of the target language.
If phenomena ofanother language which might be added later contradictthe current decomposition, specific transfer ules can beadded to the system.4 Conc lus ionTo conclude, we return to the four problems stated insection 1:Ident i f i ca t ion  of compounds presents no problem; acompound is listed in the lexicon just like any othernoun, except hat its representation is more complex.Segmentat ion  of compounds is not performed; thenumber and variety of compounds in the texts is suffi-ciently restricted, and the facilities of ELU sufficientlyflexible, to make morphological nalysis redundant.D isambiguat ion  of the structure of compounds i  notnecessary, since they are not morphologically decom-posed, and since theIn terpretat ion  of compounds is given by their lexicalentry in combination with the transfer rules whichaccept meaning representations of sentences in whichcompounds appear.In this paper we have outlined our approach to the treat-ment of compounds in a machine translation systemdealing with the limited domain of avalanches in Switzer-land.
We have shown how we used ELU, a unification-based hnguistic environment which has been developedfor the implementation of machine translation systemsfor the testing of two different approaches to the trans-lation of compounds: a transfer-based approach and anintedingua-oriented approach.
The implementation ofthe these two approaches has shown that even thoughthey have both proved satisfactory the interlingua p-proach seems more efficient and more general for thetreatment of the sublanguage because it permits a rapidand coherent reversible transfer.
The decomposition oJthe German compounds which is indispensible in an in-terlingua approach and did not complicate the systemmade it possible for us to solve the problems related tcthe translation of compounds which are the changing ot214categories, the use of synonymy and the removal or ad-dition of certain elements in the target language.Re ferencesBoesefeldt, K.
