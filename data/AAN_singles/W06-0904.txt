These qualitative rela-tions can be usefully supplemented withinformation about metric constraints,specifically as to how long events last.This paper describes the first steps in ac-quiring metric temporal constraints forevents.
The work is carried out in thecontext of the TimeML framework formarking up events and their temporal re-lations.
This pilot study examines the fea-sibility of acquisition of metric temporalconstraints from corpora.1 IntroductionThe growing interest in practical NLP applica-tions such as question-answering and text sum-marization places increasing demands on theprocessing of temporal information.
In multi-document summarization of news articles, it canbe useful to know the relative order of events soas to merge and present information from multi-ple news sources correctly.
In question-answering, one would like to be able to ask whenan event occurs, or what events occurred prior toa particular event.
A wealth of prior research by(Passoneau 1988), (Webber 1988), (Hwang andSchubert 1992), (Kamp and Reyle 1993), (Las-carides and Asher 1993), (Hitzeman et al 1995),(Kehler 2000) and others, has explored the dif-ferent knowledge sources used in inferring thetemporal ordering of events, including temporaladverbials, tense, aspect, rhetorical relations,pragmatic conventions, and background knowl-edge.
For example, the narrative convention ofevents being described in the order in which theyoccur is followed in (1), but overridden by meansof a discourse relation, Explanation in (2).
(1) Max stood up.
John greeted him.
(2) Max fell.
John pushed him.While there has been a spurt of recent researchaddressing the event ordering problem, e.g.,(Mani and Wilson 2000) (Filatova and Hovy2001) (Schilder and Habel 2001) (Li et al 2001)(Mani et al 2003) (Li et al 2004) (Lapata andLascarides 2004) (Boguraev and Ando 2005)(Mani et al 2006), that research relies on qualita-tive temporal relations.
Qualitative relations (e.g.,event A BEFORE event B, or event A DURINGtime T) are certainly of interest in developingtimelines of events in news and other genres.However, metric constraints can also be poten-tially useful in this ordering problem.
For exam-ple, in (3), it can be crucial to know whether thebomb landed a few minutes to hours or severalyears BEFORE the hospitalization.
While hu-mans have strong intuitions about this fromcommonsense knowledge, machines don?t.
(3) An elderly Catholic man washospitalized from cuts after a Prot-estant gasoline bomb landed in hisback yard.Fortunately, there are numerous instances suchas (4), where metric constraints are specified ex-plicitly:(4) The company announced Tuesdaythat third quarter sales had fallen.In (4), the falling of sales occurred over thethree-month period of time inferable from thespeech time.
However, while the announcementis anchored to a day inferable from the speech23time, the length of the announcement is notspecified.These examples suggest that it may be possi-ble to mine information from a corpus to fill inextents for the time intervals of and betweenevents, when these are either unspecified or par-tially specified.
Metric constraints can also po-tentially lead to better qualitative links, e.g.,events with long durations are more likely tooverlap with other events.This paper describes some preliminary ex-periments to acquire metric constraints.
The ap-proach extends the TimeML representation(Pustejovsky et al 2005) to include such con-straints.
We first translate a TimeML representa-tion with qualitative relations into one wheremetric constraints are added.
This representationmay tell us how long certain events last, and thelength of the gaps between them, given the in-formation in the text.
However, the informationin the text may be incomplete; some extents maybe unknown.
We therefore need an externalsource of knowledge regarding the typical ex-tents of events, which we can use when the textdoesn?t provide it.
We accordingly describe aninitial attempt to bootstrap event durations fromraw corpora as well as corpora annotated withqualitative relations.2 Annotation Scheme and CorporaTimeML (Pustejovsky et al 2005)(www.timeml.org) is an annotation scheme formarkup of events, times, and their qualitativetemporal relations in news articles.
The TimeMLscheme flags tensed verbs, adjectives, and nomi-nals with EVENT tags with various attributes,including the class of event, tense, grammaticalaspect, polarity (negative or positive), any modaloperators which govern the event being tagged,and cardinality of the event if it?s mentionedmore than once.
Likewise, time expressions areflagged and their values normalized, based on anextension of the ACE (2004) (tern.mitre.org)TIMEX2 annotation scheme (called TIMEX3).For temporal relations, TimeML defines aTLINK tag that links tagged events to otherevents and/or times.
For example, given sentence(4), a TLINK tag will anchor the event instanceof announcing to the time expression Tuesday(whose normalized value will be inferred fromcontext), with the relation IS_INCLUDED.
Thisis shown in (5).
(5) The company <EVENT even-tID=e1>announced</EVENT> <TIMEX3tid=t1 value=1998-01-08>Tuesday</TIMEX3> that <TIMEX3 tid=t2value=P1Q3 beginPoint=t3 end-Point=t4>third-quarter</TIMEX3>sales <EVENT eventID=e2> hadfallen</EVENT>.<TLINK eventID=e1 relatedToEven-tID=e2 relType=AFTER/><TLINK eventID=e1 relatedToTimeID=t1relType=IS_INCLUDED/><TIMEX3 tid=t3 value=1997-07/><TIMEX3 tid=t4 value=1997-09/>The representation of time expressions in Ti-meML uses TIMEX2, which is an extension ofthe TIMEX2 scheme (Ferro et al 2005).
It repre-sents three different kinds of time values: pointsin time (answering the question ?when??
), dura-tions (answering ?how long??
), and frequencies(answering ?how often??
)1.TimeML uses 14 temporal relations in theTLINK relTypes.
Among these, the 6 inverserelations are redundant.
In order to have a non-hierarchical classification, SIMULTANEOUSand IDENTITY are collapsed, since IDENTITYis a subtype of SIMULTANEOUS.
(An event ortime is SIMULTANEOUS with another event ortime if they occupy the same time interval.
X andY are IDENTICAL if they are simultaneous andcoreferential).
DURING and IS_INCLUDED arecollapsed since DURING is a subtype ofIS_INCLUDED that anchors events to times thatare durations.
(An event or time INCLUDES an-other event or time if the latter occupies a propersubinterval of the former.)
IBEFORE (immedi-ately before) corresponds to MEETS in Allen?sinterval calculus (Allen 1984).
Allen?s OVER-LAPS relation is not represented in TimeML.The above considerations allow us to collapsethe TLINK relations to a disjunctive classifica-tion of 6 temporal relations TRels = {SIMUL-TANEOUS, IBEFORE, BEFORE, BEGINS,ENDS, INCLUDES}.
These 6 relations and theirinverses map one-to-one to 12 of Allen?s 13 ba-sic relations (Allen 1984).Formally, each TLINK is a constraint of thegeneral form x R y, where x and y are intervals,and R is a disjunct ?i=1,..,6(ri), where  ri is a rela-tion in TRels.
In annotating a document for Ti-1 Our representation (using t3 and t4) grounds the fuzzyprimitive P1Q3 (i.e., a period of one 3rd-quarter) to specificmonths, though this is an application-specific step.
In ana-lyzing our data, we normalize P1Q3 as P3M (i.e., a periodof 3 months).
For conciseness, we omit TimeML EVENTand TIMEX3 attributes that aren?t relevant to the discus-sion.24meML, the annotator adds a TLINK iff she cancommit to the TLINK relType being unambigu-ous, i.e., having exactly one relType r.Two human-annotated corpora have been re-leased based on TimeML2: TimeBank 1.2 (Puste-jovsky et al 2003) with 186 documents and64,077 words of text, and the Opinion Corpus(www.timeml.org), with 73 documents and38,709 words.
TimeBank 1.2 (we use 1.2.a) wascreated in the early stages of TimeML develop-ment, and was partitioned across five annotatorswith different levels of expertise.
The OpinionCorpus was developed recently, and was parti-tioned across just two highly trained annotators,and could therefore be expected to be less noisy.In our experiments, we merged the two datasetsto produce a single corpus, called OTC.3 Translation3.1 IntroductionThe first step is to translate a TimeML rep-resentation with qualitative relations into onewhere metric constraints are added.
This transla-tion needs to produce a consistent metric repre-sentation.
The temporal extents of events, andbetween events, can be read off, when there areno unknowns, from the metric representation.The problem, however is that the representationmay have unknowns, and the extents may not beminimal.3.2 Mapping to Metric RepresentationLet each event or time interval x be repre-sented as a pair of start and end time points <x1,x2>.
For example, given sentence (4), and theTimeML representation shown in (5), let x befall and y be announce.
Then, we have x1 =19970701T00, x2 = 19970930T23:59, y1 =19980108Tn1, y2 = 19980108Tn2 (here T repre-sents time of day in hours).To add metric constraints, given a pair ofevents or times x and y, where x=<x1, x2> andy=<y1, y2>, we need to add, based on the quali-tative relation between x and y, constraints of thegeneral form (xi-yj) ?
n, for 1 ?
i, j ?2.
We fol-low precisely the method ?Allen-to-metric?
of(Kautz and Ladkin 1991) which defines metricconstraints for each relation R in TRels.
For ex-ample, here is a qualitative relation and its metricconstraints:(6) x is BEFORE y iff (x2-y1) < 0.2More details can be found at timeml.org.In our example, where x is fall and y is theannounce, we are given the qualitative relation-ship that x is BEFORE Y, so the metric con-straint (x2-y1) < 0 can be asserted.Consider another qualitative relation and itsmetric constraint:(7) z INCLUDES y iff (z1-y1) < 0 and(y2-z2) < 0.Let y be announce in (4), as before, and letz=<z1, z2> be the time of Tuesday, where z1 =19980108T00, and z2 = 19980108T23:59.
Sincewe are given the qualitative relation yIS_INCLUDED z, the metric constraints (z1-y1)< 0 and (y2-z2) < 0 can be asserted.3.3 Consistency CheckingWe now turn to the general problem of check-ing consistency.
The set of TLINKs for a docu-ment constitutes a graph, where the nodes areevents or times, and the edges are TLINKs.Given such a TimeML-derived graph for adocument, a temporal closure algorithm (Verha-gen 2005) carries out a transitive closure of thegraph.
The transitive closure algorithm was in-spired by (Setzer and Gaizauskas 2000) and isbased on Allen?s interval algebra, taking intoaccount the limitations on that algebra that werepointed out by (Vilain et al 1990).
It is basicallya constraint propagation algorithm that uses atransitivity table to model the compositional be-havior of all pairs of relations in a document.
Thealgorithm?s transitivity table is represented by745 axioms.
An example axiom is shown in (8):(8) If relation(A, B) = BEFORE &&relation(B, C) = INCLUDESthen infer relation(A, C) = BEFORE.In propagating constraints, links added by clo-sure can have a disjunction of one or more rela-tions in TRels.
When the algorithm terminates,any TLINK with more than one disjunct is dis-carded.
Thus, a closed graph is consistent andhas a single relType r in TRels for each TLINKedge.
The algorithm runs in O(n3) time, where nis the number of intervals.The closed graph is augmented so that when-ever input edges a r1 b and b r2 c are composed toyield the output edge a r3 c, where r1, r2, and r3are in TRels, the metric constraints for r3 areadded to the output edge.
To continue our exam-ple, since the fall x is BEFORE the Tuesday z25and z INCLUDES y (announce), we can infer,using rule 8, that x is BEFORE y, i.e., that fallprecedes announce.
Using rule (6), we can againassert that (x2-y1) < 0.3.4 Reading off Temporal ExtentsFigure 1.
Metric ConstraintsWe now have the metric constraints added tothe graph in a consistent manner.
It remains tocompute, given each event or time x=<x1, x2>,the values for x1 and x2.
In our example, wehave fall x=<19970701T00, 19970930T23:59>,announce y=<19980108Tn1, 19980108Tn2>,and Tuesday z=<19980108T00,19980108T23:59>, and the added metric con-straints that (x2-y1), (z1-y1), and (y2-z2) are allnegative.
Graphically, this can be pictured as inFigure 1.As can be see in Figure 1, there are still un-knowns (n1 and n2): we aren?t told exactly howlong announce lasted -- it could be anywhere upto a day.
We therefore need to acquire informa-tion about how long events last when the exam-ple text doesn?t tell us.
We now turn to this prob-lem.4 AcquisitionWe started with the 4593 event-time TLINKswe found in the unclosed human-annotated OTC.From these, we restricted ourselves to thosewhere the times involved were of type TIMEX3DURATION.
We augmented the TimeBank datawith information from the raw (un-annotated)British National Corpus.
We tried a variety ofsearch patterns to try and elicit durations, finallyconverging on the single pattern ?lasted?.
Therewere 1325 hits for this query in the BNC.
(Thepublic web interface to the BNC only shows 50random results at a time, so we had to iterate.
)The retrieved hits (sentences and fragments ofsentences) were then processed with componentsfrom the TARSQI toolkit (Verhagen et al 2005)to provide automatic TimeML annotations.
TheTLINKs between events and times that wereTIMEX3 DURATIONS were then extracted.These links were then corrected and validated byhand and then added to the OTC data to form anintegrated corpus.
An example from the BNC isshown in (9).
(9) The <EVENT>storm</EVENT><EVENT>lasted</EVENT> <TIMEX3VAL="P5D">five days</TIMEX3>.Next, the resulting data was subject to mor-phological normalization in a semi-automatedfashion to generate more counts for each event.Hyphens were removed, plurals were convertedto singular forms, finite verbs to infinitival forms,and gerundive nominals to verbs.
Derivationalending on nominals were stripped and the corre-sponding infinitival verb form generated.
Thesenormalizations are rather aggressive and can leadto loss of important distinctions.
For example,sets of events (e.g., storms or bombings) as awhole can have much longer durations comparedto individual events.
In addition, no word-sensedisambiguation was carried out, so differentsenses of a given verb or event nominal may beconfounded together.5 ResultsNumber ofdurationsNumber ofEventsNormalizedForm ofEvent26 1 lose16 1 earn10 1 fall9 1 rise8 1 drop7 2 decline, in-crease6 4 end, grow,say, sell5 2 income,stop4 9 ?3 17 ?2 40 ?1 176 ?Table 1.
Frequencies of event durationsThe resulting dataset had 255 distinct eventswith the number of durations for the events asshown in the frequency distribution in Table 1.The granularities found in news corpora such asOTC and mixed corpora such as BNC are domi-26nated by quarterly reports, which reflect the in-fluence of specific information pinpointing thedurations of financial events.
This explains thefact that 12 of the top 13 events in Table 1 arefinancial ones, with the reporting verb say beingthe only non-financial event in the top 13.The durations for the most frequent event, rep-resented by the verb to lose, is shown in Table 2.Most losses are during a quarter, or a year, be-cause financial news tends to quantize losses forthose periods.Duration Frequency1 day (P1D) 12 months (P2M) 1unspecified weeks (PXW) 1unspecified months (PXM) 13 months (P3M) 99 months (P9M) 31 year (P1Y) 65 years (P5Y) 11 decade (P1Y) 1TOTAL 26Table 2.
Distribution of durations for eventto loseIdeally, we would be able to generalize overthe duration values, grouping them into classes.Table 3 shows some hand-aggregated durationclasses for the data.
These classes are ranges ofdurations.
It can be seen that the temporal spanof events across the data is dominated bygranularities of weeks and months, extendinginto small numbers of years.Duration Class Count<1 min 15-15 min 121-<24 hr 201 day 142-14 days 491-3 months 1207-9 months 481-6 years 971 decade - < 1 century 301-2 centuries 2vague (unspecifiedmins/days/months, continu-ous present, indefinite fu-ture, etc.
)69Table 3.
Distribution of aggregated durationsInterestingly, 67 events in the data correspondto ?achievement?
verbs, whose main characteris-tic is that they can have a near-instantaneous du-ration (though of course they can be iterated orextended to have other durations).
We obtained alist of achievement verbs from the LCS lexiconof (Dorr and Olsen 1997)3.
Achievements can bemarked as having durations of PTXS, i.e., anunspecified number of seconds.
Such valuesdon?t reinforce any of the observed values, in-stead extending the set of durations to includemuch smaller durations.
As a result, these hiddenvalues are not shown in our data6 Estimating Duration ProbabilitiesGiven a distribution of durations for eventsobserved in corpora, one of the challenges is toarrive at an appropriate value for a given event(or class of events).
Based on data such as Table2, we could estimate the probability P(lose, P3M)?
0.346, while P(lose, P1D) ?
0.038, which isnearly ten times less likely.
Table 2 reveals peak-ing at 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months, withuniform probabilities for all others.
Further, wecan estimate the probability that losses will beduring periods of 2 months, 3 months, or 9months as ?
0.46.
Of course, we would prefer amuch large sample to get more reliable estimates.One could also infer a max-min time range,but the maximum or minimum may not alwaysbe likely, as in the case of lose, which has rela-tively low probability of extending for ?P1D?
or?P1E?.
Turning to earnings, we find that P(earn,P9M) ?
4/16 = 0.25, P(earn, P1Y) ?
0.31, butP(earn, P3M) ?
0.43, since most earnings arereported for a quarter.Figure 2.
Distribution of durationsof event to loseSo far, we have considered durations to bediscrete, falling into a fixed number of categories.These categories could be atomic TimeML DU-3See  www.umiacs.umd.edu/ ~bonnie/ LCS_ Data-base_Documentation.html.27RATION values, as in the examples of durationsin Table 2, or they could be aggregated in somefashion, as in Table 3.
In the discrete view,unless we have a category of 4 months, the prob-ability of a loss extending over 4 months is unde-fined.
Viewed this way, the problem is one ofclassification, namely providing the probabilitythat an event has a particular duration category.The second view takes duration to be continu-ous, so the duration of an event can have anysubinterval as a value.
The problem here is oneof regression.
We can re-plot the data in Table 2as Figure 2, where we have plotted durations indays on the x-axis in a natural log scale, and fre-quency on the y-axis.
Since we have plotted thedurations as a curve, we can interpolate and ex-trapolate durations, so that we can obtain theprobability of a loss for 4 months.
Of course, wewould like to fit the best curve possible, and, asalways, the more data points we have, the better.7 Possible EnhancementsOne of the basic problems with this approachis data sparseness, with few examples for eachevent.
This makes it difficult to generalize aboutdurations.
In this section, we discuss enhance-ments that can address this problem.7.1 Converting points to durationsMore durations can be inferred from the OTCby coercing TIMEX3 DATE and TIME expres-sions to DURATIONS; for example, if someoneannounced something in 1997, the maximumduration would be one year.
Whether this leadsto reliable heuristics or not remains to be seen.7.2 Event class aggregationA more useful approach might be to aggregateevents into classes, as we have done implicitlywith financial events.
Reporting verbs are al-ready identified as a TimeML subclass, as areaspectual verbs such as begin, continue and fin-ish.
Arriving at an appropriate set of classes,based on distributional data or resource-derivedclasses (e.g., TimeML, VerbNet, WordNet, etc.
)remains to be explored.7.3 Expanding the corpus sampleLast but not least, we could expand substan-tially the search patterns and size of the corpussearched against.
In particular, we could emulatethe approach used in VerbOcean (Chklovski andPantel 2004).
This resource consists of lexicalrelations mined from Google searches.
The min-ing uses a set of lexical and syntactic patterns totest for pairs of verbs strongly associated on theWeb in a particular semantic relation.
For exam-ple, the system discovers that marriage happens-before divorce, and that tie happens-before untie.Such results are based on estimating the prob-ability of the joint occurrence of the two verbsand the pattern.
One can imagine a similar ap-proach being used for durations.
Bootstrappingof patterns may also be possible.8 ConclusionThis paper describes the first steps in acquir-ing metric temporal constraints for events.
Thework is carried out in the context of the TimeMLframework for marking up events and their tem-poral relations.
We have identified a method forenhancing TimeML annotations with metric con-straints.
Although the temporal reasoning re-quired to carry that out has been described in theprior literature, e.g., (Kautz and Ladkin 1991),this is a first attempt at lexical acquisition ofmetrical constraints.
As a pilot study, it doessuggest the feasibility of acquisition of metrictemporal constraints from corpora.
In follow-onresearch, we will explore the enhancements de-scribed in Section 7.However, this work is limited by the lack ofevaluation, in terms of assessing how valid thedurations inferred by our method are comparedwith human annotations.
In ongoing work, JerryHobbs and his colleagues (Pan et al 2006) havedeveloped an annotation scheme for humans tomark up event durations in documents.
Oncesuch enhancements are carried out, it will cer-tainly be fruitful to compare the duration prob-abilities obtained with the ranges of durationsprovided in that corpus.In future, we will explore both regression andclassification models for duration learning.
In thelatter case, we will investigate the use of con-structive induction e.g., (Bloedorn and Michalski1998).
In particular, we will avail of operators toimplement attribute abstraction that will clusterdurations into coarse-grained classes, based ondistributions of atomic durations observed in thedata.
We will also investigate the extent to whichlearned durations can be used to constrainTLINK ordering.ReferencesJames Allen.
