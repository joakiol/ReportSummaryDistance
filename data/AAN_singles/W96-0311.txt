trAbstractIn this paper we outline a lexical organization for Turkish that makes use of lexical rules for inflec-tions, derivations, and lexical category changes to control the proliferation of lexical entries.
Lexicalrules handle changes in grammatical roles, enforce type constraints, and control the mapping of sub-categorization frames in valency changing operations.
A lexical inheritance hierarchy facilitates theenforcement of type constraints.
Semantic ompositions in inflections and derivations are constrainedby the properties of the terms and predicates.The design has been tested as part of a HPSG grammar for Turkish.
In terms of performance,run-time xecution of the rules seems to be a far better alternative than pre-compilation.
The latter causesexponential growth in the lexicon due to intensive use of inflections and derivations in Turkish.1 IntroductionLanguages like Finnish, Hungarian, and Turkish have relatively rich morphology which governs grammaticalfunctions often delegated tosyntax in languages such as English.
Prominence of morphology puts a greaterdemand on the information in the lexicon, which may grow to an unmanageable size due to heavy use ofinflections and derivations.
In Turkish, for instance, the nominal paradigm has three affixes (number, case,relativizer), and the verbal paradigm has eight (for voice, tense, person, aspect, and mood).
Generatingthe full paradigm for a nominal and a verbal root requires 2 3 and 2 8 entries in the lexicon, respectively.The problem is further complicated by the rich inventory of derivational affixes for both paradigms, asexemplified in 11 Hankamer \[7\] argues convincingly that full listing of every word form in the lexicon isuntenable for agglutinative languages.

For instance, a causative suffix will demote an agent o a patientor a recipient, and it will add a new grammatical role for the causer (the new agent).
A locative case suffixwill mark a NP as an adjunct, which can no longer satisfy subcategorization requirements of the verbs orpostpositions.
We elaborate on the consequences of these phenomena in section 3.Another source for economy of representation can be seen in example (2), where attributive adjectives areused as nouns in 2b and 2d.
One solution to this problem is syntactic underspecification, e.g., grouping the105nouns and adjectives under a single lexical category.
1 An alternative is to use a lexical rule for differentiatingpredicate and term reading of the lexical entry.

We also discuss processing issues uch asrun-time generation versus pre-compiling ofword forms.2 Morphology-syntax InterfaceModelling inflections, derivations, and the corresponding phonological ternations via lexical rules amountsto the lexicalization ofmorphology.
The alternatives to this approach (for Turkish) have also been explored,e.g., the modularization f syntax and morphology by keeping them (and their lexicons) as separate systemsthat communicate with each other \[5\], or integrating morphology, syntax and semantics, thus treatingmorphotactics n the same manner as syntax with respect to semantic composition \[1\].
From a computationalpoint of view, the modular approach as efficient lexical access ince lexical search is performed on rootforms, and bound morphemes are not considered lexical items.
In the integrated (multi-dimensional)approach, the lexicon contains free and bound morphemes; they have complete syntactic and semanticspecifications.
Some of the inflections, e.g.
person and number, do not have any contribution tosemantics,hence their semantic form (or LF) is that of identity.
Some inflections, uch as case and causative affixes,compose semantic form of the stem (LFs) with that of the affix.
LF, can be turned into (cause z LF,) forcausatives where z is the new argument introduced by the causative affix.
2 Similar arguments can be madefor the semantic contribution of adjunct case markers.The lexical approach to morphology presented here is a mid-point in the design of the morphology-syntaxinterface.
In this view, morphology is not isolated from syntax, but, similar to the modular organization,bound morphemes are not considered lexical items.
They can be attached to stems via lexical rules.This implies that lexical rules are responsible for semantic omposition and for the changes in syntacticrequirements.
This view also represents a middle ground in the complexity of lexical structures.I In fact, traditional Turkish grammar books uch as \[ 10\] collectively call them "substantives:'2cf.
example 9106Keeping morphology and syntax entirely separate forces one to stipulate different scopes for affixes.
Forinstance, the adverbial suffix -ken and the adjectival - u might have phrasal (3a and 3c) or lexical scope (3band 3d).
Multi-dimensional approach allows affixes to 'pick out' different scopes in mixed morphologicaland syntactic omposition.
The lexical approach can accomodate both readings, provided that lexical rulesare invoked with relevant syntactic information, e.g., valency of the verb.
Morphologically ambiguous casessuch as 4 are handled by multiple instantiations of the lexical rules.

But the choice of the strategy also affects the design of lexical organi-zation.
For instance, if inflections and derivations are handled by lexical rules, the morphological featuresneed not be kept in the lexicon, since the lexical rules will reflect he changes in syntactic and semanticrequirements coming from morphology.
If morphology is treated almost like syntax, lexical knowledgeshould contain richer morphological information, including a semantic representation forbound forms (af-fixes), information about boundedness/freeness of morphemes, and the type of attachment (e.g., affixation,cliticization, syntactic oncatenation) \[1, 8\].
This will enable the system to rule out, for instance, affixationof two free forms, or impose selectional restrictions on the stems of affixes.In this study, a lexical inheritance hierarchy is used in conjunction with the lexical rules to obtain typeconstraints and feature structures for free forms (words); bound forms are not part of the lexicon.
Thehierarchy is given in Figure 1.This tree is part of a greater hierarchy which includes inheritance information for words and phrases.
Wemake use of the inheritance and type-checking mechanism of ALE \[2\] to impose type-specific constraintson words.
Words are distinguished from phrases by disallowing any kind of gapping below the word levelin the tree.
Designating a lexical item as one of the subtypes in the hierarchy will apply all the constraintsand incorporate he feature structures of the supertypes along the path to word.
For instance, a qualitativeadjective (e.g., rahat=comfortable) is distinguished from a quantitative one (e.g., gift=double) by its choiceof modifiers; the latter does not allow intensifiers (5).107wordcommap~o;er- relativized-l a r t ~  " - verb_ldemonstrative_l qualitative_l ~infinitival_l adverbial_l finite_lrelative_l complement_lsubj_re~obj_rel lFigure 1: Lexical hierarchy(5) a. gok rahat koltukvery comfortable couch'very comfortable couch'b.

The controlled use oftype constraints at different levels of the lexical hierarchy eliminate the need to enumerate type-specificlexical rules to achieve the same effect.3 Types of lexical rulesInflections: Lexical rules for inflections can check morphotactic constraints for proper ordering of mor-phemes.
More importantly, they should reflect the grammatical or semantic requirements imposed byinflections.
For instance, the locative case suffix in Turkish also marks an NP as adjunct (6).
(6) Adam araba-da uyu-duman car-LOC sleep-TENSE.3SG'The man slept in the car'The lexical rule for locative case is given (in ALE notation) in Figure 3.
This rule is applied when thelocative suffix is attached to a nominal stem.
The head of the NP is marked with the locative case, and3We use HPSG style feature structures and signatures inour descriptions.

This is achieved by modifying the head feature MOD: While thenominative marked noun has null value, a MODSYN value with verbal head is introduced inthe head featureof the locative noun.
This will allow the locative marked noun to modify a verb.
Thus, it cannot satisfy thesubcategonzation requirements of verbs or postpositions.
This issue is critical for parsing relatively freeword-order languages where grammatical relations are often indicated by overt case marking rather thanstructural position.
Figure 3 also shows the derivation of the semantic representation for the case markedNP; at(x,y) is a second-order p edicate that holds between a term z and a predicate y.
This predicate isinserted into the set of restrictions for the noun.
Although this method is not generative in the sense of \[14\],it allows semantic composition i the lexicon.Derivations: Denominal verbs, deverbal nouns, and part of speech changes can be modelled respectivelyby adding subcategorization frames, discharging subcategorization frames, and type coercions, via lexicalrules.
The most difficult issue in derivations i the semantic composition, For instance, the -CI morpheme(with allomorph s -ct/-ci/-cu/-cii/-ft/-fi/-~u/-fii) adds the meaning "doer/user of something" (7a), "seller/loverof something" (7b), or habitual (7c).

We have been incorporating these types ofconstraints.
Unfortunately, descriptive work on Turkish linguistics in this regard is very scarce, and there isno ontology such as Levin's \[9\].
Using features like \[Tanimate\], \[:Fartifact\], \[=Fcontainer\], and \[=Fperiod\],one can define semantic fields for the derivational morphemes.
We expand the set of features as more lexicalitems are added to the lexicon.
This is a very labour intensive task; the lack of a large-scale initiative onlexicography in the manner of LDOCE or COBUILD is hindering the efforts for automatic extraction oflexical knowledge from on-line resources.Our strategy is to obtain complex forms derivationally if the semantic relation of the bound morphemeto its stem is fairly predictable.
We use lexicalized forms when the meaning is not compositional.
One suchii0case is the denominal verb suffix -le, which is very productive but has no predictable meaning that can bederived from the lexical semantics of the stem.Lexical Category Changes: As described in section 1, we model the nominal use of adjectives in Turkishby a single lexical item which may be interpreted as a term or a predicate by a lexical rule.
There areother linguistic phenomena that are on the boundary of lexicon and syntax, which we opted to contain inthe lexicon, e.g., non-referential objects, and valency change in the causatives.
In the following, we brieflydescribe the lexical rules for them.Case assignment is overt in Turkish, which allows for scrambling of the constituents, All six permutationsof the SOV order are felicitous if the object NP is case marked (e.g., 8a and 8b).
If the object is non-referentialor indefinite (cf.
8a and 8c), it is not marked morphologically, which blocks scrambling, and the unmarkedSOV order is used (cf.
8c and 8d).

* Kitap 9ocuk okuduNon-referential objects are not inflected, and they must occupy the immediately preverbal position.One way of dealing with nouns, then, is to keep two entries in the lexicon: one for unmarked form whichmay receive case marking and scramble, and one with lexically assigned case (accusative), which may notscramble.
Our solution is to have a lexical rule that changes the subcategofization frames of verbs to handlecases where objects may be case-marked NPs or unmarked Ns.
In the second case, the entity is markedindefinite and all scrambling is blocked by the lexical rule.
Figure 4 shows the lexical rule in ALE notation(the rule is simplified for ease of exposition).Causatives can be modelled in a similar vein.
A causative suffix changes the subcategofization frame ofthe verb by adding one more argument and changing the grammatical constraints on the other arguments.For instance, the new argument becomes the subject (causer), and the old subject (agent) is demoted ownthe grammatical hierarchy \[3\] to direct object or indirect object, depending on the valency of the verb:(9) a.

For instance, the locative case markerhas allomorphs -de / -da / - te / - ta .
They may be represented uniquely by two metaphonemes -DA where D isa dental stop unmarked for voice and A is a low unround vowel unmarked for backness/frontness.
Vowelharmony and voicing constraints 4 determine their surface realization during morphological composition.These kinds of rules are not lexical rules per se since they do not operate on lexical properties of the words.In our model, they are embedded in lexical rules for inflections and derivations.4 ConclusionFor a language with rich morphology, lexical rules can be used for controlled generation of surface forms.Inflections and derivations can be seen as word-based (local) operations on the root, and thus be modelledas lexical rules.
Phonological alternations in stems can be embedded in the rules as well.
Grammatical rolechanges, type constraints on word subtypes, and noun to NP promotions (as in non-referential objects) controlthe proliferation of lexical entries.
Semantic ontribution of inflections eems to be morpheme specific: Allderivations take part in semantic omposition, but some inflections (such as case and causatives) contributesemantically as well.
Most inflections (e.g., person and number markers), however, have grammaticalfunctions only.
This is not to say they do not have a semantic form, just that in many cases the form is thatof identity.
Productive use of derivations i limited by the predictability of the semantic relation of the stemto the affix.We have been testing our lexicon design as part of an HPSG grammar for Turkish \[15\].
The grammardevelopment environment, ALE, had to be modified to allow run-time valuation of lexical rules.
Compiling4cf.
\[11, 12\] for a description ofthese processes.
\[6\] is the original work on Turkish that combines finite state morphotacticswith morphophonemic alternations.112out the lexical rules seems to be impractical, since generating every possible form for a large lexicon ofroots causes exponential growth in the lexicon.
Compilation of all surface forms for a lexicon of only 40root forms produces around 2800 entries, and takes about 8 minutes on a Sun Sparcstation 10.
Run-timeexecution of rules puts the burden on parsing or generation.
We believe that as the lexicons of NLP systemsbecome more comprehensive and open-ended, the trade-off will be resolved in favour of using the lexicalrules on demand at the expense of slower performance.Acknowledgements: This research is supported in part by grants from NATO Science Division SfSIII (contract TU-LANGUAGE), and Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (contractEEEAG-90).References\[1\]\[2\]\[31Cem Bozsahin and Elvan G6~men.
