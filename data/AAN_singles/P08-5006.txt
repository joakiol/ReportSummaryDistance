Much of what computational lin-guists fall back upon to improve NLP applicationsand to model language ?understanding?
is structurethat has, at best, only an indirect attestation in ob-servable data.
An important part of our researchprogress thus depends on our ability to fully investi-gate, explain, and explore these structures, both em-pirically and relative to accepted linguistic theory.The sheer complexity of these abstract structures,and the observable patterns on which they are based,usually limits their accessibility ?
often even to theresearchers creating or attempting to learn them.To aid in this understanding, visual ?externaliza-tions?
are used for presentation and explanation ?traditional statistical graphs and custom-designed il-lustrations fill the pages of ACL papers.
These vi-sualizations provide post hoc insight into the repre-sentations and algorithms designed by researchers,but visualization can also assist in the process of re-search itself.
There are special statistical methods,falling under the rubric of ?exploratory data analy-sis,?
and visualization techniques just for this pur-pose, in fact, but these are not widely used or evenknown in CL.
These techniques offer the potentialfor revealing structure and detail in data, before any-one else has noticed them.When observing natural language engineers atwork, we also notice that, even without a formal vi-sualization background, they often create sketchesto aid in their understanding and communication ofcomplex structures.
These are ad hoc visualizations,but they, too, can be extended by taking advantageof current information visualization research.This tutorial will enable members of the ACLcommunity to leverage information visualizationtheory into exploratory data analysis, algorithm de-sign, and data presentation techniques for their ownresearch.
We draw on fundamental studies in cog-nitive psychology to introduce ?visual variables?
?visual dimensions on which data can be encoded.We also discuss the use of interaction and animationto enhance the usability and usefulness of visualiza-tions.Topics covered in this tutorial include a review ofinformation visualization techniques that are appli-cable to CL, pointers to existing visualization toolsand programming toolkits, and new directions in vi-sualizing CL data and results.
We also discuss thechallenges of evaluating visualizations, noting dif-ferences from the evaluation methods traditionallyused in CL, and discuss some heuristic approachesand techniques used for measuring insight.
Informa-tion visualizations in CL research can also be mea-sured by the impact they have on algorithm and datastructure design.Information visualization is also filled with op-portunities to make more creative visualizations thatbenefit from the CL community?s deeper collectiveunderstanding of natural language.
Given that mostvisualizations of language are created by researcherswith little or no linguistic expertise, we?ll coversome open and very ripe possibilities for improvingthe state of the art in text-based visualizations.6
