This paperpresents a detailed computational analysisof Kazakh language which is anagglutinative language.
With a detailedanalysis of Kazakh language morphology,the formalization of rules over allmorphotactics of Kazakh language isworked out and a rule-based morphologicalanalyzer is developed for Kazakh language.The morphological analyzer is constructedusing two-level morphology approach withXerox finite state tools and someimplementation details of rule-basedmorphological analyzer have been presentedin this paper.1 IntroductionKazakh language is a Turkic language whichbelongs to Kipchak branch of Ural-Altaiclanguage family and it is spoken approximatelyby 8 million people.
It is the official languageof Kazakhstan and it has also speakers inRussia, China, Mongolia, Iran, Turkey,Afghanistan and Germany.
It is closely relatedto other Turkic languages and there existsmutual intelligibility among them.
Words inKazakh language can be generated from rootwords recursively by adding proper suffixes.Thus, Kazakh language has agglutinative formand has vowel harmony property except forloan-words from other languages such asRussian, Persian and Arabic.Having a morphological analyzer for anagglutinative language is a starting point forNatural Language Processing (NLP) relatedresearches.
An analysis of inflectional affixes ofKazakh language is studied within the work ofa Kazakh segmentation system (Altenbek andWang, 2010).
A finite state approach forKazakh nominals is presented (Kairakbay andZaurbekov, 2013) and it only gives specificalternation rules without generalized forms ofalternations.
Here we present all generalizedforms of all alternation rules.
Moreover, manystudies and researches have been done upon onmorphological analysis of Turkic languages(Altintas and Cicekli, 2001; Oflazer, 1994;Coltekin, 2010; Tantug et al., 2006; Orhun et al,2009).
However there is no complete workwhich provides a detailed computationalanalysis of Kazakh language morphology andthis paper tries to do that.The organization of the rest of the paper isas follows.
Next section gives a briefcomparison of Kazakh language and Turkishmorphologies.
Section 3 presents Kazakh voweland consonant harmony rules.
Then, nouns withtheir inflections are presented in Section 4.Section 4 also presents morphotactic rules fornouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs andnumerals.
The detailed morphological structureof verbs is introduced in Section 5.
Results ofthe performed tests are presented together withtheir analysis in Section 6.
At last, conclusionand future work are described in Section 7.2 Comparison of Closely RelatedLanguagesThere are many studies and researches priormade on closely related languages bycomparing them for many purposes related withNLP such as Turkish?Crimean Tatar (Altintasand Cicekli, 2001), Turkish?Azerbaijani(Hamzao?lu, 1993), Turkish?Turkmen (Tantu?et al., 2007), Turkish-Uygur (Orhun et al, 2009)and Tatar-Kazakh (Salimzyanov et al, 2013).
Adeep comparison of Kazakh and Turkishlanguages from computational view is anotherstudy which is in out of scope for this work.However, in this study, a brief grammaticalcomparison of these languages is given in orderto give a better analysis of Kazakh language.46Kazakh and Turkish languages have manycommon parts due to being in same languagefamily.
Possible differences are mostlymorpheme based rather than deep grammardifferences.
Distinct morphemes can be addedin order to get same meaning.
There exist somedifferences in their alphabets, their vowel andconsonant harmony rules, their possessiveforms of nouns, and inflections of verbs asgiven in Table 1.
There are extra 9 letters inKazakh alphabet, and Kazakh alphabet also has4 additional letters for Russian loan words.Both Kazakh language and Turkish employvowel harmony rules when morphemes areadded.
Vowel harmony is defined according tolast morpheme containing back or front vowel.In Kazakh language, if the last morphemecontains a back vowel then the vowel of nextcoming suffix is a or ?.
If the last morphemecontains one of front vowels then the vowel ofnext coming suffix is e or i.
In Turkish, suffixeswith vowels a, ?, u follow morphemes withvowels a, o, u, ?
and suffixes with vowels e, i, ?follow morphemes with vowels e, i, ?, ?depending on being rounded and unroundedvowels.
Consonant harmony rule related withvoiceless letters is similar in both languages.Turkish KazakhLanguageAlphabet Latin29 letters( 8 Vowels,21 Consonant )Cyril42 letters( 10 Vowels,25 Consonants,3 CompoundLetters,4 RussianLoan WordLetters )Vowel &ConsonantHarmonySynharmonismaccording toback, front,unrounded androundedvowelsSynharmonismaccording toback and frontvowelsPossessiveForms ofNouns6 types ofpossessiveagreements8 types ofpossessiveagreementsCaseForms ofNouns7 Case Forms 7 Case FormsVerbs Similar Tenses Similar TensesTable 1.
Comparison of Kazakh and Turkish.In Kazakh language there are 8 types ofpersonal possessive agreement morphemes asgiven in Table 2.
Kazakh language has twoadditional possessive agreements for secondperson.There are some identical tenses and moodsof verbs in both language such as definite pasttense, present tense, imperative mood, optativemood and conditional mood.
They have nearlysame morphemes for tenses.
On the other handthere are some tenses of verbs which areidentical according to meaning and usage, butdifferent morphemes are used.
Moreover, inKazakh language there are some tenses such asgoal oriented future and present tenses whichdo not exist in Turkish language.PossessivePronounRepresentationExamples forEke, ?father?NonePossessivePnon  Eke fatherMy P1Sg 1 Eke-mmyfatherYour P2Sg 2 Eke-NyourfatherYour(Polite)P2PSg 2Eke-NizyourfatherHis/Her P3Sg 3 Eke-sihisfatherOur P1Pl 1Eke-mizourfatherYour Plural P2Pl 2Eke-leriNyourfatherYour Plural(Polite)P2PPl 2Eke-leriNizyourfatherTheir P3Pl 3Eke-leritheirfatherTable 2.
Possessive Agreement of Nouns.3 Vowel and Consonant HarmonyKazakh is officially written in the Cyrillicalphabet.
In its history, it was represented byArabic, Latin and Cyrillic letters.
Nowadaysswitching back to Latin alphabets in 20 years isplanned by the Kazakh government.
In thebeginning stage of study, Latin transcription ofCyril version is used for convenience.Two main issues of language such asmorphotactics and alternations can be dealtwith Xerox tools.
First of all, morphotacticrules are represented by encoding a finite-statenetwork.
Then, a finite-state transducer foralternations is constructed.
Then, the formednetwork and the transducer are composed into a47single final network which cover allmorphological aspects of the language such asmorphemes, derivations, inflections,alternations and geminations (Beesley andKarttunen, 2003).Vowel harmony of Kazakh language obeysa rule such that vowels in each syllable shouldmatch according to being front or back vowel.It is called synharmonism and it is basiclinguistic structure of nearly all Turkiclanguages (Demirci, 2006).
For example, aword qa-la-lar-dIN, ?of cities?
has a stem qa-la, ?city?
and two syllables of containing backvowels according to the vowel harmony rule.Here ?lar is an affix of Plural form and ?dIN isan affix of Genitive case.
However, as statedbefore, there are a lot of loan words fromPersian and generally they do not obey vowelharmony rules.
For example, a word mu-Ga-lim, ?teacher?
has first two syllables have backvowels and the last one has a front vowel.
Sosuffixes to be added are defined according tothe last syllable.
For example, a word muGalim-der-diN, ?of teachers?
has suffixes with frontvowels.
On the other hand, there aremorphemes with static front vowels which areindependently from the type of last syllable canbe added to all words such as Instrumentalsuffix ?men.
In this case, all suffixes addedafter that should contain front vowels.Name XFST   Type 1 Type 2SonorousConsonantSCons l r y w m n NVoicedConsonantVCons z Z b v g dVoicelessConsonantVLCons p f q k t s S C x cConsonant Consb p t c x d r z Z s SC G f q k g N l m nh w y vVowel Vowel a e E i I O o u U jFrontVowelFVowel e E i O U jBackVowelBVowel a I o uTable 3.
Groups of Kazakh letters according totheir sound.
Upper case letters are used for non-Latin letters.In order to construct a finite-state transducerfor alternation rules, there are some capitalletters such as A, J, H, B, P, C, D, Q, K, T aredefined in intermediate level and they areinvisible by user.
These representations areused for substitution such as A is for a and eand J is for I and i.
So if suffix dA should beadded according to morphotactic rules, it meanssuffixes da or de should be considered.
In Table3, there are group of letters defined according totheir sounds and these groups are used inalternation rules (Valyaeva, 2007).Consonant harmony rules are variedaccording to the last letter of a word with inmorphotactic rules.
As in Table 3, differentpatterns are presented in order to visualize therelation between common valid rules and togeneralize morphotactic rules.
Thus, in eachcase according to morphotactic rules there areproper alternation rules for morphemes.GROUP 1Ablative Case Locative case Dative CasedAn    dA     TAtAn  tA  TAnAn  3 ndA 3 nA 3A 1/2GROUP 2Genitive Case Accusative Case Poss.

Alternation rules according to groupsof letters.All alternation rules for suffixes depend onthe last letter of a morpheme with inmorphotactic rules and Table 4 gives somegroupings that can be made in order to set somegeneralized rules overall.
Patterns of last lettersof morphemes in Table 4 are matched withgroups of letters presented in Table 3.
In Table4, Locative case affix is ?dA, if the last letter ofa morpheme is one of Vowel, Sonorous48Consonant or Voiced Consonant of Type 1 inTable 3.
On the other hand, it is ?tA, if the lastletter is Voiceless Consonant or VoicedConsonant of Type 2.
Here A is for a or eaccording to last syllable of containing Front orBack Vowel.In Table 4, boxes presented by numberssuch as 1, 2 and 3 are used for personalpossessive agreements in Table 2.
For example,word Eke, ?father?
in Ablative case without apossessive agreement takes suffix ?den,because the word Eke ends with vowel e.However, in third person possessive agreementit takes suffix ?nen, because all words withthird person possessive agreement in Ablativecase always take suffix ?nen even though thethird person possessive agreement morphemeends with vowel.According to those similarities in Table 4,there are some generalized rules which are validin many cases in grammar including verbs andderivations.
Some of these generalized rulesderived from close patterns given in Table 4,are given in Table 5.
For example, Rule 12 inTable 5 represents rules for Locative and Dativecases in Group 1 in Table 4.
In Table 4,Locative and Dative suffix rules are nearlyidentical and have same patterns which can beobserved visually.
Also, Accusative andPossessive Pronouns of Type 2 are same.1 21 Rule 11Ablative CaseRule 12 Locative,Dative cases2 Rule 21Genitive caseRule 22Accusative case,Poss.
Affix-23 Rule 31Plural Form ofNounRule 32Negation, PersonalAgreement of A1Pl4 Rule 41InstrumentalcaseRule 42PersonalAgreement of A1SgTable 5.
Generalized Rules.In Dative case of GROUP 1 in Table 4, ifthe last letter is Back Vowel then T is replacedby G and T is replaced by g if the last letter isFront Vowel.
Thus, a word bala, ?child?becomes bala-Ga, ?to child?
and a word Eke,?father?
will be Eke-ge, ?to father?.
If the lastletter is Voiceless Consonant, T is replaced by qor k depending on whether the last syllablecontains Back Vowel or Front Vowel.
Forexample, a word kitap-qa, ?to book?
has thelast letter of Voiceless Consonant and the lastsyllable contains Back Vowel, thus T isreplaced by q.
A word mektep-ke, ?to school?has the last letter of Voiceless Consonant andthe last syllable contains Front vowel, thus T isreplaced by k.After detailed analysis of the language itcan be seen that there are mainly common rulesof alternations valid over all grammar.
Thereare about 25 main alternation rules defined forall system together with generalized rules and 7exception rules for each case.
All these rules areimplemented with XFST tools (Beesley andKarttunen, 2003).
For instance, some mainlyused common rules are given below and theyare called by capital letters defined only inintermediate level.
As mentioned before theyare invisible by user.
Here 0 is for emptycharacter.Rule H & Rule B: H is realized as 0 or J, B isrealized as 0 or A.
[H->0,B->0||[Vowel]%+_[Cons]][H->J,B->A]If the last letter of a morpheme is Vowel andthe first letter of the following suffix isConsonant then H and B are realized as 0.Otherwise, they are realized as J and B. Someexamples are:ana-Hm?
ana-m, ?my mother?iS-Hm?
iS-Jm?Rule J?iSim, ?my stomache?ege-Br?
ege-r, ?will sharpen?bar-Br?
bar-Ar?
Rule A?bar-ar, ?will go?Rule J & Rule A: J is realized as I or i and A isrealized as y, a or e.[A->y||[Vowel]%+_][A->a,J->I||[BVowel](Cons)*%+?*_][A->e,J->i||[FVowel](Cons)*%+?
*_]If the last letter of a morpheme is Vowel then Ais realized as y, and if the last syllable of amorpheme contains Back Vowel then A and Jare realized as a and I.
Otherwise, if the lastsyllable of a morpheme contains Front Vowelthen A and J are realized as e and i. Someexamples are:bas-Hm?bas-Jm?basIm, ?my head?dos-tAr?dos-tar, ?friends?dEpter-lAr?
dEpter-ler, ?copybooks?barma-AmIn?barma-ymIn, ?I will not go?Rule T (a part of Rule 12 in Table 5): T isrealized as q, G, k or g.[T->q||[BVowel](?)[VLCons]%+_][T->k||[FVowel](?)[VLCons]%+_][T->G||[BVowel](?)[0|SCons|VCons1]%+_][T->g||[FVowel](?
)[0|SCons|VCons1]%+_]49This rule is a part of Rule 12 given in Table 5for Dative case.
It is one of generalized ruleswhich are valid in many cases such asderivation of nouns, adjectives and verbs.
Someexamples are:bala-Ta?
bala-Ga, ?to child?
(Noun in Dative)Zaz-TI?
Zaz-GI, ?of summer?
(Adjective)ZUr-Teli?ZUr-geli, ?since coming?
(Verb)estit-Tiz?
estit-kiz, ?make hear?
(CausativeVerb)4 NounsNouns in Kazakh Language take singular orplural (A3Sg, A3Pl) suffixes, Possessivesuffixes, Case suffixes and Derivationalsuffixes.
In addition, nouns can take PersonalAgreement suffixes when they are derived intoverbs.
For example, kitap-tar-da-GI-lar-dINwhich means ?of those which is in books?
hasthe following morphological analysiskitap+Noun+A3Pl+Pnon+Loc^DB+Noun+Zero+A3Pl+Pnon+Gen.Every nominal root at least has form ofNoun+A3Sg+Pnon+Nom.
Therefore, a rootnoun kitap which means ?book?
has thefollowing morphological analysiskitap+Noun+A3Sg+Pnon+Nom.These inflections of noun are given in FSTdiagram in Figure 1.Figure 1.
The FSA model of inflectionalchanges of a noun.It can be seen that nominal root can be insingular form by adding (+0) no suffix which isin fact third personal singular agreement(A3Sg) and by adding suffix (+PAr) in pluralform which is in fact third personal pluralagreement (A3Pl).
Here P is an intermediatelevel representation letter for d, t or l in surfacelevel.
After, possessive affixes (+Pnon:0,+P1Sg:Hm, +P2Sg:HN, +P2PSg:HNJz, +P3Sg:sJ,+P1Pl:HmJz, +P2Pl:HN, +P2PPl:HNJz, +P3Pl:s)and case affixes (Nom, Dat, Abl, Loc, Acc, Gen,Ins) are added.
Here H and J are intermediateletters.
All morphotactic rules together withadjective, pronoun, adverb and numerals aregiven in Figure 2.
It can be observed that everyadjective can be derived to noun and nounswith relative affix can be derived to adjectives.There are other derivations which are producedby adding some specific suffixes between verbsand nouns, adjectives and adverbs, adjectivesand nouns.
In order to get rid of complex viewthose derivations are not explicitly shown inFigure 2.Figure 2.
Morphotactic Rules for Nominal Roots.50In our system, the root of a word is astarting point for morphemes defined in lexiconfile, and other morphemes are added accordingto morphotactic rules.
Thus, starting from aroot the system checks for all possiblefollowing morphemes and if a word is matchedit gives appropriate output and moves to nextstate.
For example, a surface form of a wordkitaptan, ?from a book?
will have intermediateform of ?kitap+tan?
after implementedalternation rules.
First it will check and find anoun root from lexicon.
Then after givingoutput as ?kitap+Noun?, continues with nextstate which is Singular/Plural.
At this state itwill go on with 0 input giving output of +A3Sgfor singular form of noun.
Then, the next statewill be Possessive Affix state to determine thepersonal possessive suffix.
Here it is 0, thusepsilon transition which gives output as +Pnon.Now the output is ?kitap+Noun+A3Sg+Pnon?.The next state is Case state in order torecognize the case of noun.
Thus, for giveninput such as +tan, the output is determined as+Abl and this continues until the systemreaches the final state or invalid state which isunacceptable state not returned to user.
Allpossible morphemes are defined in the lexiconand all states are visualized in Figure 2.Figure 3.
Tenses of Verbs in KazakhLanguage.5 VerbsVerbs are terms which define actions and states.Mainly three tenses exist such as present, futureand past as stated in Figure 3.
Moreover,conditional, optative and imperative moods arealso defined.
However in detailed form thereare thirteen tenses together with modals inKazakh language.
These tenses are worked outfrom many resources where presentation andnaming have variance among each otheraccording to their scholars (Tuymebayev, 1996;Mamanov, 2007;  Isaeva and Nurkina, 1996;Musaev, 2008).
For example, according toIsaeva and Nurkina (1996) awIspalI keler Saq?Future Transitional Tense?
denotes action infuture and has same affix as Present Tense.However, Mamanov (2007) pointing out thatawIspalI keler Saq, ?Future Transitional Tense?denotes present action.
Additionally, there arelarge amount of auxiliary verbs which definetenses and some modal verbs.
However in casesthat auxiliary verbs are not used verbs becomeas deverbial adverbs or participles which defineverb or noun (Demirci, 2006).
In Figure 4,morphotactic rules of verbs and modals aregiven.
Derivations of verbs to nouns andadverbs with specific suffixes are shown withasterisk in Figure 4.Verbs can be in reflexive, passive, collectiveand causative forms.
For instance, verb tara-wmeans ?to comb?, tara-n-w in reflexive infinityform, tara-l-w in passive infinity form, tara-s-win collective infinity and tara-tQJz-w and tara-tTJr-w in causative infinity form.
Here, Q, Jand T are intermediate letters.
However not allverbs can have all of these forms at the sametime.Verbs in infinity form are generally formedwith last letter w. For example: kelw whichmeans ?to come?.
The system is performingover generalization on verbs which takeauxiliary verb on appropriate tenses.
Thoseverbs are analyzed as derived adverbs orincomplete verbs on that tense since every verbof sentence should have personal agreement atthe end and personal agreement affix added tothe verb itself after the suffix of tense or to theauxiliary verb.
In constructed morphologicalanalyzer, we make analysis of every singleword and for that reason generalization of somerules are made by giving more than one result.51Figure 4.
Morphotactic Rules of Verbs in Kazakh Language.For example, kel-geli tur-mIn means ?I amplanning to come?.
Here tur is an auxiliaryform which actually defines the tense of theverb and takes personal agreement affix mIn.Without an auxiliary verb, the word kel-gelimeans ?since coming?
and derived as anadverb.
Thus compound verbs are examinedseparately.
Some of tenses have differentpersonal agreement endings and they arepresented in Figure 46 Tests and AnalysisAs mentioned before, the system isimplemented using Xerox finite-state tools forNLP.
Morphotactic rules and possiblemorphemes are defined in lexicon file andcompiled with lexc tool.
Alternation rules aredefined in regex file and rule transducer iscomposed with lexicon file in one network withxfst tool.
Loan words, proper names andtechnical terms are not included.
System isworking in two directions as in lexical andsurface level.
Due to the ambiguities inlanguage there is no one-to-one mappingbetween surface and lexical forms of words andthe system can produce more than one result.A large corpus of Kazakh words(Qazinform, 2010) not seen by themorphological analyzer before has beencontinually analyzed in order to enhance thesystem by adding new words to lexicon.
Thereare approximately 1000 words randomlyselected from web which exist in lexicon andanalyzed with the system.
The percentage ofcorrectly analyzed words is approximately96%.
Most of the errors are mainly the errorsthat occurred in the analysis of technical wordswhich do not obey alternation rules of KazakhLanguage.
In Table 6, the w1.txt file has moretechnical words than w2.txt file.
The results ofthe tests are given in Table 6.
Errors due toRules are exception errors which are notincluded in transducer yet.
We hope in nearfuture enhancing of the system will beperformed by including all these rules.
Also itcan be seen in Table 6 that Kazakh words have2.1 morphologic parses on average.FilesTotalWordsCorrectlyAnalyzedWordsTotal ErrorsRules Analyzerw1.txt 1000 962 30 8w2.txt 1010 978 26 6Morphologic Ambiguity is 2.1Table 6.
Test Results.7 ConclusionLanguage is one of the main tools forcommunication.
Thus its investigation provides52better perspectives on all other aspects relatedwith NLP.
However, formalization andcomputational analysis of Kazakh languagemorphology is not widely worked out.
In otherwords, there is a lack of tools for analysis ofKazakh language morphology fromcomputational point of view.
Moreover,grammar resources contain variances dependingon scholars.
For example, in some resourcesthere are twelve tenses, whereas in others thereare much less tenses of verbs.
Naming of tensescan also vary from source to source.
Tosummarize, building correctly working systemof morphological analysis by combining allinformation is valuable for further researcheson language.In this paper, a detailed morphologicalanalysis of Kazakh language has beenperformed.
Also, a formalization of rules overall morphotactics of Kazakh languages isworked out.
By combining all gainedinformation, a morphological analyzer isconstructed.
For future work, enhancing ofsystem by adding exception rules related withloan words and proper names should beperformed.
Having more stabilized system withlessened possible rule errors some internaldetails of character encoding will also besolved.
Moreover, releasing the working systemto users on the web and collecting feedbacksare intended.
These feedbacks from users canhelp on improving the system capacity andlessen any possible errors.
This is planned to beperformed with using an open sourceenvironment which is alternative to XeroxXFST, namely Foma by Hulden (2009).ReferenceAltenbek G and Wang X.
