3 -10-20sawaMitaka, Tokyo, JAPAN 181matsui@icu.ac.jpAbstractAccessibility of candidate r ferents i a crucialfactor in successful reference assignment andthis intuition has been adequatelyaccommodated and developed in centeringtheory.
By contrast, another equally importantfactor involved in reference assignment,namely, accessibility of contextualassumptions, seems to have not beenaddressed fully as a part of a computationaltheory of reference.
In the field of pragmatics,however, the role of context has always beenone of the central issues and the recentapproach to context selection based on thenotion of relevance (Sperber & Wilson1986/1995) seems to be currently the mostpromising.
In this paper, I will review andassess the recent centering approach to theinterpretation of Japanese zero pronouns(Walker et al 1994) as a case study, andsuggest that relevance theory can provide oneway of complementing it.
In order ?toincorporate a needed mechanism of contextualselection i to a model of reference assignment,model builders must take into account heheater's ability to anticipate certain cognitiveeffects that may be achieved by upcomingutterances.
It is my hope that this paper willlead to a fruitful discussion of finding possibleways of using Sperber & Wilson-'s notion ofrelevance inpractical applications.1.
IntroductionWhen a system has to assign a referent to areferring expression, it is almost always thecase that there is more than one candidatereferents and one has to resort o some Way ofeliminating the wrong candidates in order tochoose the right one.There are two main ways of doing this.First, candidate referents can be ranked on thebasis of accessibility (Erlm & Gundel 1987;Fretheim and Gundal 1996; C~mbacher andHargreaves 1988, Grosz et al 1995; Sidner1983a, b; Walker et al 1998).
Alternatively,they can be checked against the accessibilityof contextual assumptions (F'mcher-Kiefex1993; Kintsch 1988, Magliano et al 1993;McKoon & Ratcliff 1992; Sanford & Garrod1981; Sharkey & Sharkey 1987; Singer 1993,1995).In either case, once a candidate is singledout, the acceptability of the referent needs tobe tested against some pragmatic riteria.Currently, we seem to have at least threedistinct criteria vailable:i. Truth-based cr i ter ion-  i.e.
whether theoverall, interpretation is l ikely to befactually plausible (Clark 1977; Clark &Haviland 1977; Erku & Gundel 1987;Sanford & Gan~ 1981; Sidner 1983a);iL Coherence-based criterion - i .e .
whetherthe overall interpretation is likely to becoherent (Asher & Lascaries 1993; Groszet al 1995, 1998; Hobbs 1979; Lascarides& Asher 1993; Sanders et aL 1992; Walkeret aL 1994, 1998);Hi.
Relevance-based criterion - i.e.
whetherthe overall interpretation is likely to beoptimally relevant (Matsui 1993, 1995,1998; Wilson 1992; Wilson & Matsui1998).11oIn this paper, I will focus on one version ofcoherence-based criterion, namely, centeringtheory.
One of the goals of centering theory isto sort out the various mechanisms used tomaintain discourse coherence, and the use ofvarious referring expressions i regarded asone such mechanism.
Among the varioushypotheses put forward by centering theory,what concerns us most is the following: that'each utterance \[except the initial utterance\] ina coherent discourse segment contains a singlesemantic entity - the backward-looking center\[or Cb\] - that provides a link to the previousutterance, and an ordered set of entities - theforward-looking centers \[or Cf\] - that offerpotential links to the next utterance'(Gordon etal.
1993:311).
There are two rules to provideconstraints on choosing centers, which areshown in (1):( l)Rule 1: If any element of Cf (Un) isrealised by a pronoun in Un+l then theCb (Un+l) must he realised by apronoun also.Rule 2: Sequences ofcontinuation arepreferred over sequences ofretaining;and sequences ofretaining are to bepreferred over sequences ofshifting.The first rule states that the most highlyranked element of the forward-looking centerof a previous utterance is the backward-looking center of the current utterance, andmust be realised by a pronoun if any elementof the Cf of the previous utterance is realisedby a pronoun in the current utterance.
Thefollowing example from Gordon et ai.
(1993).shown here in (2).
illustrates this nde:(2)\[l\]Susan gave Betsy a pet hamster.Cf={Susan, Betsy, hamster I )\[2\]She r minded her such hamsters werequite shy..Cb=Susa,; Cf={St~m.
Betsy.
hamsters}\[3\]She asked Betsy whether she likedthe gift.Cb~usan; Cf=-\[Susan.
Betsy,gift=hamster I }\[3 "\]Susan asked her whether she likedthe gift.Here, the first utterance has no Cb because it is12the initial sen'tence of a discourse.
Its Cfincludes the referents off'Susan' and 'Betsy'and the semantic interpretation f 'a hamster',ranked in that order.
The second utterance hasSusan as the Cb and a Cf with Susan as itsmost highly ranked element.
The thirdutterance preserves the Cb and prominent Cffrom the previous utterance, therefore itpronominalises the Cb successfully.
Bycontrast, utterance \[3 1, in which Susan isrealised by a name and Betsy is realised by apronoun, leads to stylistic infelicity.
Accordingto Gordon et al, this is due to violation ofRule 1 mentioned above.The ranking of forward-looking centers isgenerally based on the discourse salience ofeach candidate ntity.
According to Grosz etaL (1995), although an ultimate criteria fordeciding the ranking has not been worked outyet, there are evidences to support he idea thatgrammatical role such as SUBJECT, OBJECT,etc., can affect the Cf ranking.
Thus, I willsimply assume here the following preferencein ranking forward-looking center shown in(3), as suggested by Grosz et al (ibid.
):(3)SUBJECT>OBJECT>OTHERSThe highest ranked member of the set offorward-looking centers is called the'preferred center; or Up" As mentionedabove, Cp is regarded as the most likelycandidate for Cb in the following utterance.Mother important claim made by centeringtheory is  that discourse segments are morecoherent if they share the same Cb.
On thebasis of this idea, different degrees ofcoherence are proposed.
For example, Walkeret al adopt he following 4 types of transitionbetween discourse segments ,  eachcorresponding to different degree ofcoherence, using the notion of Cb and Cp;.namely.
'continue.
'retain; 'smooth-shift"and "rough-shift'.
These are shown in (4).When two utterances, say Ui-I and U share thesame Cb, and the same entity is  also thehighest-ranked Cf, i.e.
Cp, in Ui- l ,  thetransition from Ui-I  to Ui is called 'continue:When Ui-1 and Ui share the same Cb, but the0000000000000@0@00000@0@00000000000000000000@OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO0OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOsame entity is not the highest-ranked Cf in Ui,the transition is called 'retain '.
When Ui-1 andUi do not share the same Cb, there are twopossibilities: if Cb in Ui is the same as Cp inUi, the transition is 'smooth-shift'; if Cb in Uiis not the same as Cp in Ui, it is 'rough-shift '.It is claimed that when the hearer has tochoose one from several possibleinterpretations, the one based on the mostcoherent ransition should be chosen.
The 4transition states are ordered in the followingway according to their preference:(4)CONTINUF~RETAIN>SMOOTH-SHIFT>ROUGH-SHIFFThe second of the two rules in (1) is about hisordered preference oftransition states.'2.
Walker et al (1994) and Japanese zeropronoun resolutionWalker et ai.
(1994) propose the followingranking order of forward-looking centers todeal with Japanese:(5)(Grammatical or Zero) TOPIC >EMPATHY > SUBJECT ?
OBJECT2 ?OBJECT> OTHERSAs you can see, they add two new grammaticalroles, namely, topic and empathy, to the list offactors affecting pronoun resolution.
Since thenotion of topic will become important in thediscussion which follows, I will brieflydescribe the Japanese topic marker below.
Forempathy-loaded verbs, please refer to Kuno1987 and Kuno & Kaburaki 1977.In Japanese, both in written and spokendiscourse, lqPs which can be recovered fromcontext are often omitted.
The omitted NPs areoften called 'zero pronouns'.
It is widelyagreed that missing NPs in JapaneSe behavelike pronouns in other languages uch asThere were only three aTtn:idon statea in t&e or igml\[o~ulmion by Gron et ~ (1983, /99S), namely,CONTINUE, RETAIN and SHIFZ.
Fhe distinctionbetween SMOOTH-SHIFT and ROUGII-SHIFF w~r\ [u~ proposed in Brenn~ (1987).English.
Japanese zero pronouns hould bedistinguished from missing NPs in 'pro-drop'languages such as Italian, since in 'pro-drop'languages, information to recover missing NPsis morphologically encoded elsewhere in thesentence, e.g.
in the form of verb inflection,whereas Japanese lacks such an overtencoding.Japanese zero pronouns are used equallyoften as inter-sentential discourse anaphorsand intra-sentential naphors.
Here, I willconcentrate on their use as discourse anaphors,where the role of context and adequatepragmatic riterion is crucial.
For those whoare interested in intra-sentential use of zeropronouns, please refer to e.g.
Hasegawa 1985and Kameyama 1986.In Japanese, there are several postpositionalparticles.
The one we are interested in here is'wa; which is often called a ~opic marker:As the name suggests, 'via' is typically used toconstruct a grammatical topic of a sentence,which is characterised as an entity whoseexistence is presupposed.
The function of 'wa"might become clearer when it is comparedwith another particle 'ga; which marks a hrPin the subject position, which typicallyconveys a new information.
Compare (6a) and(6b):(6) a. John ga hana o kaua.SUB flowers ACe bought?
'John bought flowers.'b.
John wa hana o katta.TOP flowers A~ bought"John bought flowers.
'(6a) and (6b) share the same propositionalcontent.
However, only (6a) is acceptable asan answer to the question such as Whobought flowers?"
while only (6b) is acceptableas an answer to the question such as What didJohn buy?'.
There are various suggestionsabout how to characterise functions of the twoparticles (see e.g.
Shibatani 1990; Tanaka1991), and although it is an interestingquestion on its own, it shouldn't concern ushere.
This is because Walker et al are onlyinterested in the surface form of 'lqP+wa;13which is automatically given the highestaccessibility ranking in their framework.Walker et al claim that a topic NP is morelikely to be realised as a zero pronoun in thesubsequent discourse than any other NPs dueto its highest degree of accessibility.Moreover, in Walker et al 's framework, topicNP is given two further advantages: theysuggest (a) that a NP marked by %va' becomesthe backward-looking center even at the onsetof the discourse; and (b) that once topic NP isrealised as the backward-looking center ,aslong as it continues to be realised as a zeropronoun in subsequent discourse, it couldcontinue to be the backward-looking center.The second advantage given to the topic NP iscalled 'zero topic assignment', which isdefined as in (7):('/)Zero Topic Assignment (ZTA)(optional)When a zero in Ui+l representsan e titythat was Cb  (Ui), and when no otherCONTHqUE transition is available, thatzero may be interpreted as the ZEROTOPIC of Ui+lWalker et al demonstrate that theirframework, including an optional rule of zerotopic assignment, can successfully explain thepreference in the interpretation of the lastsentence in(8):(8)\[1\] Hanako wa siken o oete,TOP exam ACC finishkyooahitu ni modorim~hlta.classroom to returned1-1anako returned to the classroom,finishing her exams'Cb=Hanako; Cff\[Hanako, exam}\[2\] 0 ~n o rotta ni shimaimashito.book Ace locker in took-away'(She) put her books in the locker'Cb=Hanako; Cff-{Hanako, book}\[3\]/tsumo n yooni Michiko gaalways like SUB0 monda/no tok/kata oquestionssolve-way ^CO14setumeishimashita.explained'Michiko, as usual, explained (to her)how to answer questions.

In their analysisof (8), the preference in the interpretation i\[4\] is explained by zero topic assignment in\[3\] and preference on 'continue' transition in\[4\].In summary, Walker et aL's account ofJapanese zero pronoun is based on twoindependent preference mechanisms: the firstone is the forward center farting, and thesecond is the ordered transition states.However, as Walker et al themselves pointout, each transition state between discoursesegments is determined by the ordering offorward looking centers, the predictions of thetheory tend to depend more largely on theforward center ranking.3.
Problems with Walker et alNow I would like to discuss some problemsWith Walker et al "s framework.
Needless tosay.
it has great advantages, uch as relativeease of computational imPlementation.Moreover, I agree that accessibility of0000000000000000@0000000@00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000discourse ntities plays an important role inreference assignment, and their forward centerranking is an adequate nough approximationof accessibility of discourse entities indifferent grammatical categories in Japanese.However, as I mentioned before, there arecases whose interpretation process cannotposs!bly be explained by the accessibilityfactor alone.
Accounts of reference assignmentwhich are largely based on accessibility ofdiscourse entities tend to exhibit theirweaknesses when they face cases whichrequire some pragmatic inferences, andWalker et al is not an exception here.
I willillustrate two problems they need to solvebelow.3.1, Multiple topicsOne of the most obvious shortcomings ofWalker et al 's approach is that it cannothandle situations where there is more than onetopic in a sentence.
In  their framework, inorder to identify zero pronouns, the backward-looking center has to be identified first.
Thebackward-looking center, in turn, isdetermined by the way forw~d-lookingcenters are ranked.
Therefore, the mostpowerful mechanism in their framework is theforward-looking center anking shown in (5)above.
However, notice that it is only useful ifthere is no more than one entity in eachcategory in a sentence.Let us concentrate on the category of topichere.
In Walker et al 's framework, the topicmarker 'wa' is given a special status: the topicmarker 'wa' is so powerful that the topic NPbecomes the most highly ranked forward-looking center even at the onset of a discourse;in addition, once a topic NIP is realised as thebackward-looking center, as long as itcontinues to be realised as zero pronoun insubsequent discourse, it could continue to bethe backward-looking center.
This status of thetopic NP rightly allows the possibility ofmultiple topics as in (9), which is very oftenseen in Japanese discourse:(9)\[1\] Mary to Jane war shinyuu ckand TOP best friends are'Mary and Jane are each other's best.friend.
'\[2\]Senshuu no Doyoubi, Mary wa kazelast week GE~ Saturday TOP coldo hiite nete-ita^CC had lying-wasLast Saturday, Mary had a cold andwas lying on the bed.
'\[3\]ltsumo n youni, Jane waalways GEN as TOPohiru goro denwa shita.noon around telephone did'As always, Jane phoned (Mary) aroundnoon.\[4\]0  eiga ni so, sou tsurnori datta.film to invite planning to was'(She) was planning to invite (her) to afilm.
'However, cases of multiple topics cause aserious problem to Walker et al Here, thepreferred interpretation f \[4\] is that Jane wasplanning to invite Mary to a film.
Walker et almight explain this preference by saying thatthis is because 'Jane'is the backward-lookingcenter in \[4\].
According to their framework,however, the alternative interpretation,namely, that Mary was planning to invite Janeto a film, is equally accessible, since 1Vfary"could continue to be the backward-lookingcenter in \[4\].
The problem is that in theircurrent framework, Walker et al do notprovide any mechanism to choose oneinterpretation a d discard the other.There is another problem concerningmultiplicity of entities with equal degree ofaccessibility.
In Japanese, post-positionalparticles uch as ~va' and 'ga" shouldn't beused more than once in a sentence.
Thus, youwouldn't come across sentences with twoovertly marked topics or subjects.
However, itis possible to have more than one NP withmore or less equal salience in one sentence, forexample, when two nouns; the first being amodifier and the second being the head noun,form a NP.
A noun modifier is followed by aparticle 'no', the Genitive Case particle.
Someexamples of NPs which contain nounmodifiers are shown in (10):15(lO)a. Mary no tomodachiGEN friendqVIary's friend'b.
Niwa no kigarden GEN tree'A tree in the garden"c. Tegami no henjiletter GEN reply'A reply to the letter'Here, the first noun in each NP is the modifier.The most typical relation exhibited betweentwo nouns combined by the particle 'no' is the'possessive' relation, as in (lOa).
However, theuse of 'no' is by no means restricted to thatrelation, as illustrated in (lOb) and (lOc).
Nowconsider (11), which include a NP with thisstructure:( i I)(A memo written by a man, andaddressed to his wife)\[l\]Kooto no botanga toreta.
', coat GEN button SUB came off~3ne of the buttons of (my) coat hasoff'\[2\]0 0 sagashi.temo, 0 mitsukaranakattasearch-although was not found'(I) tried to find (i0, but failed.
'\[3\]gyou jyuu ni 0 0 0 sagashitetoday within at findtsukete-hos/u?.fix -want'(1) want (you) to find and fix (it)today.
"\[4\]Ash/~ 0 0 h/tauyou Ja,tomorrow needTomorrow, (1) will need (it)'( 12)\[1\]Sakuba~ John wa fitensha no kagilast night TOP bicycle GEN keyo kake-wasweta.ACe lock-forgetl.ast night, John forgot" to use the key tolock his bicycle'\[2\]gesa, too, 0 na/amatteita.this morning already gone-hasThis morning, (it) has already gone'In (11), 'one of the buttons of my coat' isintroduced in \[1\] as the subject of the sentence.What is important here is that  the NPintroduces two conceptual entities, namely, a'coat' and a ~outton', which are equallyaccessible.
The question is whether Walker etal.
's framework can handle cases like (11).
For\[2\], the preferred interpretation is that thespeaker wants his wife to find and fix thebutton today.
Walker et al 's system wouldsuccessfully predict that the button is thebackward-center+ for \[2\] and \[3\].
However, for\[4\], the preferred interpretation is that thespeaker will need his coat tomorrow, ratherthan the button.
I do not see how Walker et alcan explain this.
Example (12) causes exactlythe same problem for them.
Walker et alwould predict hat the preferred interpretationshould be that the key has gone.
Th isobviously is the wrong prediction.
The point Iwould like to make here is that here are manycases in Japanese discourse where there ismore than one roughly equally salientdiscourse entity in a sentence whichsubsequently become qually strong candidatereferents for zero pronouns, and somemechanism of choosing the right one isneeded.3.2.
Ordered preference of transition statesNow I would like to move on to a differentkind of problem, which concerns their orderedpreference of transition states shown in (4).Walker et al, as well as centering theorists ingeneral, assume that when there are more thanone possible overall interpretation available,the one which exhibits 'continue' transition isprefene& This is based, on the assumption thatmaximally coherent segments are those thatrequire less processing effort and the heaterwill prefer an interpretation which requiresless processing effort.
However, it is notdifficult to think of examples which go againsttheir assumption.
For example, look at (13)and (14):(13)Mary \[l\] KinouO Peterto denwa deyesterday with telephone byj /tan o kahnn/n dek/m?160000000000000000000@000@0@000000@00000000000OOOOOOOO@OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO@OO0OOOO0@OOOtime ACC confirm could'could you confirm the time with Peter byphone yesterday?
'John \[2\] lya, 0 dekinakatta.no couldn't~10, (I) couldn't'John \[3\] 0 ie ni inakattnhome at present-not-wasaL (I) was not at home.
\[CONTINUE\]b.
(He) was not at home \[SHIFI'\](I 4)\[ ~ \]John wa jou~hi ni mama gaTOP boss with head SUBagaranai.hold-not'John Cannot hold up his head before his boss(i.e.
John cannot help feeling ashamed ofhimself in front of his boss).\[2\]ltsumo 0 kaisha ni 0 saki ni kuru.always office to earlier come'(He) always comes to the office earlier(than him).'a.
(John) always comes to the office earlier(than his boss).b.
(John's boss) always comes to the officethan (John).Let us look at (13) first.
What interests mehere is the interpretation f the zero pronounin \[3\].
Notice that both \[3a\] and \[3b\] areequally acceptable in terms of factualplausibility.
In such case, Walker et al wouldpredic~ that \[3a\], which exhibits a 'continue'transition should be preferred.
However, forsome reason, the preferred interpretation for\[3\] is not \[3a\], but \[3b\].
Similarly, in (14), thepreferred interpretation for \[21 is definitely\[2b\].
However, Walker et al predict hat \[2a\]should be preferred.
Obviously, theirmechanism based on the accessibility oftransition states makes wrong predictions.
Inthe next section, I will consider why this is thecase.4.
A relevance-theoretic solution topreblems with Walker et alSperber & Wilson's relevance theory (Sperber& Wilson 1986/95) inherits the Griceanassumption that the hearer's goal of verbal17understanciing is to find an interpretationintended by the speaker.
However, it differsfrom Gricean approach in two crucial points: itdoes not take the view that we have to followmaxims, nor the view that we have to be co-operat ive,  to achieve successfulcommunication.
Sperber & Wilson claim thatwhat makes communication achievable at allis a fundamental mechanism built in ourcognitive system, namely, the pursuit ofrelevance.
This is expressed as the First, orCognitive, Principle of Relevance:(15)Cognitive Principle of Relevance?
Human Cognition tends to be geared tomaximisation ofrelevance.the.The notion of relevance is defined in termscognitive effects, i.e.
some changes in thebelief system, and processing effort to obtainsuch effects:(16)Relevancea.
The greater the cognitive ffects, the greaterthe relevance;b.
The smaller the effort needed to achievethose effects, the greater the relevance.Cognitive ffects result from the interaction ofnew and old (or contextual) information i  oneof the following three ways: (a) combiningwi.~..~ an existing assumption to y ie ldcontextual implications; (b) strengthening anexisting assumption; (c) contradicting andeliminating an existing assumption."
Processingeffort is the mental effort needed to parse theutterance, decide what proposition andpropositional attitude it was intended toexpress, access an appropriate context, andwork out the contextual effects of the utterancein the context.
When an utterance has morethan one possible interpretation, the hearershould look for the one which satisfies thefollowing conditions of optimal relevance:( 17)Optimal relevanceAn utterance is optimally relevant to the heateriff:a. it is relevant enough to be worth the heater'sprocessing effort;b. it is the most relevant one compatible withthe speaker's abilities and preferences.The Second, or Communicative Principle ofRelevance, governs this search process:(I 8)Communicative Principle of RelevanceEvery utterance communicates a presumptionof its own optimal relevance.The pursuit of optimally relevant interpretationsuggests a pattern of comprehension procedurethe hearer should follow, which can be spelledout as (19):(19)Relevance-theoretic comprehensionprocedurea.
consider cognitive ffects in their orderof accessibility (i.e.
follow a path of leasteffort);b. stop when the expected level of relevance isachieved.Now let me illustrate how thiscomprehension procedure should work forJapanese zero pronoun resolution illustrated in(11), (12), (13) and (14).
In Matsui (1995,1998, also Wilson and Matsui 1998), I havedeveloped the idea proposed by Wilson (1992)that in addition to the factor of accessibifity ofcandidate r ferents, there is another importantfactor which affects the bearer's choice ofreferent, namely, accessibifity of contextualassumptions.
Accessibility of contextualassumptions becomes particularly crucialwhen there is more than one roughly equallyaccessible candidate referent.
and it is thefactor which is vital to solve problems withWalker et al.
In fact.
the importance ofcontextual ssumptions in reference resolutionhad been recognised before and variousproposals were made as to how to retrieve theright context: some appeal to situationallypartitioned knowledge (e.g.
Sanford & Oan~1981) and others arc motivated by textualcoherence (e.g.
Hobbs 1979; Asher &Lascarides 1993).
The account pursued here isdifferent from any existing accounts in that it18claims that the selection of contextualassumptions i  ordered in terms of both theiraccessibility and likeliness to contributetowards cognitive ffects of the utterance.
Inother words, in relevance theory, it is assumedthat these candidate referents are tested inparallel, with the one which gives quickestaccess to a context in which the utterance as awhole yields an acceptable overallinterpretation being selected.As a working hypothesis, let us assume thatcertain contextual ssumptions are accessed bythe hearer after the immediately precedingutterance is processed, during and after thecurrent utterance is being processed.
I have nospecific claim here concerning what triggersthe retrieval or the construction of certaincontextual ssumptions, and can go along withexisting suggestions (e.g.
it can be triggered bylexical information, or/and by situationalknowledge).
As the second workinghypothesis, I would like to suggest hat afterhaving understood an utterance, the hearertends to have, if not always, fairly accurateexpectation as to what kind of cognitiveeffects he would like to obtain from the nextutterance.. Relevance theory predicts that whenan utterance creates in the hearer anexpectation for a specific ognitive ffect o beachieved by the next utterance, other thingsbeing equal, the hearer is more likely to spen dhis processing effort to find an interpretationwhich can achieve such cognitive ffect wheninterpreting the utterance.
As a consequence,the candidate r ferent which is not the highestin the general accessibility ranking canbecome the most accessible to the hearer if thereferent is expected to contribute to theinterpretation hcis looking for.
In other words,relevance theory predicts the alteration ofaccessibility ranking of the candidate referentsas a result of the pursuit of certain cognitiveeffects.Consider examples (I1) and (12) in thecontext discussed above.
In (11), the utterancein \[3\] is a request to the wife to find and fixthe missing button of the speaker's coat beforetomorrow.
Generally, if someone asks you todo something by certain time, there should be00000000000000000000000000000@000000000P00@0OOOO@OOOOOOOOOOO@O@OO@OOOOOOOOO@OOOOOOOOOOO0a good reason for such a time limit, since thetime limit in turn maY create certain priority.Thus, it should be reasonable to assume thatafter hearing the utterance in \[3\], the questionsuch as 'why do I have to do it today?'
or'can't it wait a little while?'
occurred in thehearer's mind.
If so, the utterance in \[4\] canreadily be interpreted as the reason why hemade such a request: he wants to wear the coaton the following day.
The referent is assignedautomatically during the process of findingexpected the cognitive ffects.
Of course, whathe needs is the coat with the button fixed, andthis interpretation is only possible with theoverall interpretation i which the 'coat:rather than the 'button" is the referent of thezero pronoun.
The first utterance in (12), onthe other hand, seems to create different kindof expectation i the hearer.
After hearing thatthe bicycle was left unlocked, the most likelyquestion occurs to everyone's mind is 'whathappened to the bicycle?"
We all know thelikely consequence of the unlocked bicycle,and the hearer of (12) gets the expectedcontextual effects by interpreting the zeropronoun as the ~icycle; rather than the ~ey '.In both (13) and (14); it is reasonablyassumed that the hearer will have a why-question in his mind before hearing the finalutterance.
In the case of (13), the only possiblereason why John could not confirm the timewith Peter by phone was because Peter wasnot .at home when John phoned, and the zeropronoun is resolved .automatically in theprocess of obtaining this interpretation.
I willJook at (14) in more detaiL The interpretationof (14) might be explained like this.
Afterprocess ing the first utterance, certainassumptions might become moderatelyaccessible (but not necessarily at the consciouslevel) to the hearer:, e.g.
various assumptionsabout John and his boss, and more generalassumptions about l~eing ashamed of ;  e.g.that one must feel unhappy about suchsituation, or that one must have specif icreasons for such feeling, etc.
In this way,contextual assumptions might contribute toform the hearer's anticipation about the waysubsequent utterances achieve relevance.When the  hearer interprets the secondutterance in (14), further:-assumptions relatedto the event described, such as that 'workersare encouraged to come to work early ', or~osses like their workers to arrive beforethem' etc., might become highly accessible.Such assumptions contribute to the hearer'ssearch for the way the utterance could achievecognitive effects.
At the final stage of theinterpretation process, the hearer finds the onlyway in which the second utterance in (14)might be intended to achieve relevance in acontext created by the first - namely, as anexplanation for why John cannot help feelingashamed of himself in front o f  his boss - andthe zero-pronouns are resolved automaticallyin the process.Furthermore, notice that as a consequenceof using the notion of accessibility ofcontextual ssumptions, an ad hoc system suchas the ordered preference in transition states inWalker et aL's account becomes automaticallyunnecessary.
For example, our frameworkcould easily accommodate cases such as (13)and (14), where the referent of a zero pronounin the current discourse is not the same as thatof a zero pronoun in the preceding discourse,as well as cases where the most accessiblecandidate referent indeed coincides with thereferent chosen on the basis of the preferredoverall interpretation.
Recall that the orderedtransition states is created on the basis of theassumption that the hearer prefers aninterpretation which exhibits 'continue"relation, because such an interpretationrequires less processing effort.
I suggest thatthis assumption is ultimately wrong for thefollowing reason: the preferred interpretationby the hearer is the one which providesenough cognitive ffects worth his processingeffort, rather than the one which merelyrequires less processing effort.
Walker et alwould predict hat the preferred interpretationfor the second sentence in (14) is that "Johnalways comes to his office earfier than hisboss.'
The question we have to ask here is:how could this interpretation possibly achieverelevance?
I cannot easily see how.
Relevancetheory predicts that such interpretation will19never be considered when there is analternative interpretation accessible whichachieves relevance, even if the latter mightrequire more processing effort.
Notice herethat the relevance theory shares the view thatthe intended interpretation should be the mostaccessible one for the hearer.
However, in theframework of relevance theory, it isaccessibility of contextual assumptions,together with the accessibility of contextualreferents, that determines the overallaccessibility of an interpretatimL In this way,the fact that the preferred interpretation f thesecond sentence in (14) is more accessibleoverall for most of us, than the alternativeinterpretation, is adequately explained in thisframework.5.
SummaryIn this paper, I have proposed a way ofcomplementing centering theory from arelevance-theoretic perspective.
I havesuggested that a model of referenceassignment which appeals to the expectationbased on the accessibility of candidatereferents uch as centering theory shouldultimately accommodate some mechanism ofcontextual selection and pointed out that thehearer's expectation of specific contextualeffects (a type of forward inferences) houldbe taken advantage of in creating such amechanism.
Recently, Oberlander (1998) saysthat 'the key lesson from the work on pronoungeneration and interpretation is that we mustdevelop a more sophisticated view of'~xpectafion.
