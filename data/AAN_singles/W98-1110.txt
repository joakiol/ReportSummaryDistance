Generalized unknown morpheme guessing for hybrid POS taggingof Korean*J eongwon Cha  and Geunbae Lee and Jong-Hyeok  LeeDepartment of Computer Science & EngineeringPohang University of Science & TechnologyPohang, Korea{himen, gblee, jhlee}@postech.ac.krAbst rac tMost of errors in Korean morphological anal-ysis and POS (Part-of-Speech) tagging arecaused by unknown morphemes.
This paperpresents a generalized unknown morpheme han-dling method with P OSTAG (POStech TAGger)which is a statistical/rule based hybrid POStagging system.
The generalized unknown mor-pheme guessing is based on a combination ofa morpheme pattern dictionary which encodesgeneral exical patterns of Korean morphemeswith a posteriori syllable tri-gram estimation.The syllable tri-grams help to calculate lexicalprobabilities of the unknown morphemes andare utilized to search the best tagging result.In our scheme, we can guess the POS's of un-known morphemes regardless of their numbersand positions in an eojeol, which was not possi-ble before in Korean tagging systems.
In a se-ries of experiments using three different domaincorpora, we can achieve 97% tagging accuracyregardless of many unknown morphemes in testcorpora.1 In t roduct ionPart-of-speech (POS) tagging has many difficultproblems to attack such as insufficient trainingdata, inherent POS ambiguities: and most se-riously unknown words.
Unknown words areubiquitous in any application and cause majortagging failures in many cases.
Since Koreanis an agglutinative language, we have unknownmorpheme problems instead of unknown wordsin our POS tagging.The usual way of unknown-morpheme han-dling before was to guess possible POS's for anunknown-morpheme by checking connectable" This project was supported by KOSEF (teukjeongki-cho #970-1020-301-3, 1997).functional morphemes in the same eojeol l(Kang, 1993).
In  this way, they could guesspossible POS's for a single unknown-morphemeonly when it is positioned in the begining ofan eojeol.
If an eojeol contains more than oneunknown-morphemes or if unknown-morphemesappear other than the first position, all theprevious methods cannot efficiently estimatethem.
sO, we propose a morpheme-patterndictionary which enables us to treat unknown-morphemes in the same way as registered knownmorphemes, and thereby to guess them regard-less of their numbers and positions in an eo-jeol.
The unknown-morpheme handling usingthe morpheme-pattern dictionary is integratedinto a hybrid POS disambiguation.The POS disambiguation has usually been per-formed by statistical approaches mainly usinghidden markov model (HMM) (Cutting et al,1992; Kupiec.
1992; Weischedel et al, 1993).However.
since statistical approaches take intoaccount neighboring tags only within a limitedwindow (usually two or three), sometimes thedecision cannot cover all linguistic ontexts nec-essary for POS disambiguation.
Also the ap-proaches are inappropriate for idiomatic expres-sions for which lexical terms need to be directlyreferenced.
The statistical approaches are notenough especially for agglutinative languages(such as Korean) which have usually complexmorphological structures.
In agglutinative lan-guages, a word (called eojeol in Korean) usu-ally consists of separable single stem-morphemeplus one or more functional morphemes, and thePOS tag should be assigned to each morphemeto cope with the complex morphological phe-nomena.
Recently, rule-based approaches aretAn eojeol is a Korean spacing unit(similar to En-glish word) which usually consists of one or more stemmorphemes and functional morphemes.85re-studied to overcome the limitations of staffs-tical approaches by learning symbolic taggingrules automatically from a corpus (Brill, 1992;Bril!.
1994).
Some systems even perform thePOS tagging as part of a syntactic analysis pro-cess (Voutilainen, 1995).
However, rule-basedapproaches alone, in general, are not very ro-bust, and not portable enough to be adjustedto new tag sets and new languages.
Also the.performance is usually no better than the sta-tistical counterparts (Brill, 1992).
To gain theportability and robustness and also to overcomethe limited coverage of statistical approaches,we adopt a hybrid method that can combineboth statistical and rule-based approaches forPOS disambiguation.2 L ingu is t ic  character i s t i cs  ofKoreanKorean is classified as an agglutinative lan-guage in which ~.n eojeol consists of severalnumber of morphemes that have clear-cut mor-pheme boundaries.
For examples.
'Q~ ~'~Tl~l~t r-l-(I caught a cold)" consists of 3 eojeols and7 morpheme, such as2 Q(I) /T + ~(au:~iliaryparticle)/jS, %1-71(cold)/MC + oil(other parti-cle)/jO, ~ e.l(catch)/DR + N(past tense)/eGS+ c\]-(final ending)/eGE.
Below are the charac-teristics of Korean that must be considered formorphological-level natural anguage processingand POS tagging.As an agglutinative language, KoreanPOS tagging is usually performed ona morpheme basis rather than an eo-jeol basis.
So, morphological analysisis essential to POS tagging becausemorpheme segmentation is much moreimportant and difficult than POS assign-ment.
Moreover: morphological analysisshould segment out unknown morphemesas well as known morphemes, so un-known morpheme handling should beintegrated into the morphological nalysisprocess.
There are three possible analysesfl'om the eojeol "Q~"  : 'Q(I) /T'  +' ~(subject-marker)/jS', ~ut-(sprout)/DR'+ '~(adnominal)/eCNMG', ?~(fly)/DI'+ '~(adnominal)/eCNMG', so morpheme"~Here, '+ '  is a morpheme boundary in an eojeol and' / '  is for the POS tag symbols (see Fig.
1).segmentation is often ambiguous.?
Korean is a postpositional language withmany kind of noun-endings (particles),verb-endings (other endings), and prefinalverb-endings (prefinal endings).
It is thesefunctional morphemes, rather than eojeol'sorder, which determine most of the gram-matical relations such as noun's syntacticflmctions, verb's tense, aspect, modals, andeven modi~ing relations between eojeots.For example.
~/ jS '  is an atuxiliary parti-cle, so eojeol ~'G-~-" has a subject role dueto the particle :~/ jS ' .?
Complex spelling changes frequently occurbetween morphemes when two morphemescombine to form an eojeol.
These spellingchanges make it difficult to segment heoriginal morphemes out before assigningthe POS tag symbols.Fig.
1 shows a tag set extracted from 100 fullPOS tag hierarchies in Korean.
This tag set willbe used in our experiments in section 6.3 Unknown morpheme guess ingdur ing  morpho log ica l  ana lys i sMorphological analysis is a basic step to naturallanguage processing which segments input textsinto morphotactically connectable morphemesand assigns all possible POS tags to each mor-pheme by looking up a morpheme dictionary.Our morphological analysis follows generalthree steps (Sproat, 1992): morpheme seg-mentation, original morpheme recovery fromspelling changes, and morphotactics modeling.Input texts are scanned from left to right.,character3by character, to be matched to mor-phemes in a morpheme dictionary.
The mor-pheme dictionary (Fig.
2) has a separate n-try for each variant form (called allomorph) ofthe original morpheme form so we can easily re-construct he original inorphemes from spellingchanges.For morphotactics modeling, we used the POStags and the morphotactic adjacency symbols inthe dictionary.

To model the morpheme's connectabil-ity to one another, besides the morpheme dictio-nary, the separate morpheme-connectivity tableencodes all the connectable pairs of morphemegroups using the morpheme's tag and morpho-tactic adjacency symbol patterns.
After an in-put eojeol is segmented by trie indexed ictio-nary search, the morphological nalysis checks ifeach segmentation is grammatically connectableby looking into the morpheme-connectivity ta-ble.For unknown morpheme guessing, we develop ageneral unknown morpheme estimation methodfor number-free and position-free unknown mor-pheme handling.
Using a morpheme patterndictionary, we can look up unknown morphemesin the dictionary exactly same way as we dothe registered morphemes.
And when mor-phemes are checked if they are connectable, wecan use the iEformation of the adjacent mor-phemes in the same eojeol.
The basic idea of themorpheme-pattern dictionary is to collect allthe possible general exical patterns of Koreanmorphemes and encode ach lexical syllable pat-tern with all the candidate POS tags.
So we canassign initial POS tags to each unknown mor-pheme by only matching the syllable patternsin the pattern dictionary.
In this way, we don'tneed a special rule-based unknown morphemehandling module in our morphological nalyzer,and all the possible POS tags for unknown mor-phemes can be assigned just like the registeredmorphemes.
This method can guess the POSof each and every unknown morpheme, if morethan one unknown morphemes are in an eojeol,regardless of their positions ince the morphemesegmentation is applied to both the unknownmorphemes and the registered morphemes dur-87ing the trie indexed ictionary search.3.1 Morpheme pat tern  d ic t ionaryThe morpheme pattern dictionary covers allnecessary syllable patterns for unknown mor-phemes including common nouns, proper-nouns, adnominals, adverbs, regular and irreg-ular verbs, regular and irregular adjectives, andspecial symbols for foreign words.
The lexical.patterns for morphemes are collected from theprevious studies (Kang, 1993) where the con-straints of Korean syllable patterns as to themorpheme connectabilities are well described.Fig.
3 shows some example ntries of the mor-pheme pattern dictionary, where ;Z', ;V', ;*' aremeta characters which indicate a consonant, avowel, and any number of Korean charactersrespectively.
For example, ~L..7_-l--g\]" (thanks),which is a morpheme and an eojeol at the sametime, is matched "(ZV*N)" (shown in Fig.
3) inthe morpheme pattern dictionary, and is recov-ered into the original morpheme form "2_~".4 A hybr id  tagg ing  mode lsentencei ~ ................

4 shows a proposed hybrid architecture forKorean POS tagging with generalized unknown-morpheme guessing.
There are three ma-jor components: the morphological analyzerwith unknown-morpheme handler, the statisti-cal tagger, and the rule-based error corrector.The morphological nalyzer segments the mor-phemes out of eojeols in a sentence and recon-structs the original morphemes from spellingchanges from irregular conjugations.
It also as-signs all possible POS tags to each morphemeby consulting a morpheme dictionary.
Theunknown-morpheme handler integrated into themorphological nalyzer assigns the POS's of themorphemes which are not registered in tim dic-tionary.The statistical tagger runs the Viterbi algo-rithm (Forney, 1973) on the morpheme graphfor searching the optimal tag sequence for POSdisambiguation.
For remeding the defects ofa statistical tagger, we introduce a post error-correction mechanism.
The error-corrector is arule-based transformer (Brill, 1992), and it cor-rects the mis-tagged morphemes by consideringthe lexical patterns and the necessary contex-tual information.4.1 Statist ical  POS taggerStatistical tagging model has the morphemegraph as input and selects the best morphemeand POS tag sequence r for sentences repre-sented ill the graph.
The morpheme-graph isa compact way of representing nmltiple mor-pheme sequences for a sentence.
We put eachmorpheme with the tag as a node and the mor-pheme connectivity as a link.Our statistical tagging model is adjusted fromstandard bi-grams using the Viterbi-search(Cutting et al, 1992) plus on-the-fly extra com-puting of lexical probabilities for unknown mor-phemes.
The equation of statistical taggingmodel used is a modified hi-gram model withleft to right search:n )3Pr(ti lrni)T ?

So wedecided to use supervised training using taggedcorpora with relative frequency counts.
Thethree necessary probabilities can be estimatedas follows:Pr(tilmi) .~ f(t i lmi) = N(mi, ti) (8)N(t )Pr(ti) ~ f(t i) = 41 (9)Pr(tilti-1) .~ f(t i l t i - t )  = N(t i - : ,  ti) N(ti-t) (10)where N(mi,  ti) indicates the total number ofoccurrences ofmorpheme .mi together with spe-cific tag ti, while N(mi)  shows the total number.of occurrences of morpheme rni in the taggedtraining corpus.
The N(t i_ l , t i )  and N(ti-1)can be interpreted similarly for two consecutivetags ti-1 and ti.4.2 Lexlcal probabil i ty estimation forunknown morpheme guessingThe lexical probabilities for unknown mor-phemes cannot be pre-calculated using theequation (8), so a special method should beapplied.
We suggest o use syllable tri-gramssince Korean syllables can duly play importantroles as restricting units for guessing POS of aPr(tilmi) morpheme.
So the lexical probability e,-(tdfor unknown morphemes can be estimated us-ing the frequency of syllable tri-gram productsaccording to the following formula:m = ele2...e~ (11)89equation 2 equation 3eojeol 86.80 90.48morpheme 91.32 94.93eq:uation 489.4094.40equation 5 equation 689.62 91.7394.48 95.77equation 7(equation l)92.4896.12Table 1: Tagging performance of each equation.

Asmentioned before, Korean eojeol has very com-plex morphological structure so it is necessaryto look at the functional morphemes selectivelyto get the grammatical relations between eo-jeols.
For these reasons, we designed error-correcting rules for eojeols to compensate s-timation and modeling errors of the statisti-cal morpheme tagging.
However, designing theerror-correction rules with knowledge ngineer-ing is tedious and error-prone.
Instead, weadopted Brill's approach (Brill, 1992) to auto.matically learn the error-correcting rules fromsmall amount of tagged corpus.
Fortunately,Brill showed that we don't need a large amountof tagged corpus to extract he symbolic taggingrules compared with the case in tile statisticaltagging.
Table 2 shows some rule schemata weused to extract he error-correcting rules: wherea rule schema designates the context of rule ap-plications, i.e.. the morpheme position and thelexical/tag decision in the context eojeol.The rules which can be automati-cally learned using table 2's schemataare in the form of table 3, where\[current eojeol or morpheme\] consists ofmorpheme (with current tag) sequence in theeojeol, and \[corrected eojeol or morpheme\]consists of morpheme (with corrected tag) se-quence ill the same eojeol.
For example, the rule\[N (Chinese ink)/MC + ~-/jS\]\[N1FT, MC\] --~\[N(to eat)/DR + ~-/eCNMG\] says thatthe current eojeol was statistically tagged ascommon-noun (MC) plus auxiliary particle(iS), but when the next first eojeol's (N1)first position morpheme tag (FT) is anothercommon-noun (MC), the eojeol should betagged as regular verb (DR) plus adnominalending (eCNMG).
This statistical error iscaused from the ambiguity of the morpheme"N" which has two meanings as "Chinese ink:'(noun) and "to eat" (verb).
Since the mor-pheme segmentation is very difficult ill Korean,many of the tagging errors also come from themorpheme segmentation errors.
Our error-correcting rules call cope with these morpheme90rule schemaN1FTP1LTN2FTN3FTP1LMP1FMN1FMdescriptionnext first eojeol (N1) first morpheme's tag (FT)previous first eojeol (P1) last morpheme's tag (LT)next second eojeol (N2) first morpheme's tag (FT)next third eojeol (N3) first morpheme's tag (FT)previous first eojeol (P1) last morpheme's lexical form (LM)previous first eojeol (P1) first morpheme's lexical form (FM)next first eojeol (N1) first morpheme's lexical form (FM)Table 2: Some rule schemata to extract the error-correcting rules automatically from the taggedcorpus.
POSTAG has about 24 rule schemata in this form.\[current eojeol or morpheme\] \[rule schemata, referenced morpheme or tag\] \[\[corrected ojeol or morpheme\] ITable 3: Error correction rule formatsegmentation errors by correcting the errors inthe whole eojeol together.
For example, the fol-lowing rule can correct morpheme segmentationerrors: \[~/MC 4- ol.7_./jO\]\[P1LM, @\]-~ \[~o\]/DR + _7-~eCCl.
This rule says thatthe eojeol "@old" is usually segmented ascommon-noun "~" (meaning string or rope)plus other-particle "o\]..v_.
", but when themorpheme "~" appears before the eojeol, itshould be segmented as regular-verb ,;@o\] "(meaning shrink) plus conjunctive-ending ':2.
".This kind of segmentation-error c rection cangreatly enhance the tagging performance inKorean.
The rules are automatically earned byComparing the correctly tagged corpus with theoutputs of the statistical tagger.
The trainingis leveraged (Brill, 1992) so the error-correctingrules are gradually learned as the statisticaltagged texts are corrected by the rules learnedso far.6 Exper iment  resu l tsFor morphological nalysis and POS tagging ex-periments, we used 130000 morpheme-balancedtraining corpus for statistical parameter estima-tion and 50000 morpheme corpus for learningthe post error-correction rules.
These trainingcorpora were collected from various ources uchas internet documents, encyclopedia, newspa-pers, and school textbooks.For the test set, we carefully selected three dif-ferent document sets aiming for a broad cover-age.
The document set 1 (25299 morphemes;1338 sentences) is collected from :'Kemong en-cyclopedia 6,, hotel reservation dialog corpus 7and internet document, and contains 10% ofunknown morphemes.
The documents et 2(15250 morphemes; 5774 sentences) is solely col-lected from various internet documents fromassorted domains such as broadcasting scriptsand newspapers, and has about 8.5% of un-known morphemes.
The document set 3 (20919morphemes; 555 sentence) is from Korean stan-dard document collection set called KTSET 2.0 sand contains academic articles and electronicnewspapers.
This document set contains about1470 unknown morphemes (mainly technical jar-gons).Table 4 showsour taggingperformance for thesethree document sets.
This experiment showsefficiency of our unknown morpheme handlingand guessing techniques ince we can confirmthe sharp performance drops between tagger-aand tagger-b.
The post error correction rulesare also proved to be effective by the perfor-mance drops between the full tagger and tagger-a, but the drop rates are mild due to the perfor-mance saturation at tagger-a, which means thatour statistical tagging alone already achievesstate-of-the-art performance for Korean mor-pheme tagging.6from ETRI:from Sogang University, Seoul.

Thesystem POSTAG was developed to test.
thesenovel ideas especially for agglutinative lan-guages uch as Korean.
Japanese is also similarto Korean in linguistic characteristics and willbe a good target of these ideas.
POSTAG inte-grates morphological nalysis with generalizedunknown-morpheme handling so that unknowm-morpheme can be processed in the same manneras registered morphemes using morpheme pat-tern dictionary.
POSTAG adopted a hybrid ap-proach by cascading statistical tagging to rule-based error-correction.
Cascaded training wasimplemented to selectively learn statistical tag-ging error-correction rules by Brill style trans-formation approach.
POSTAG also employs hi-erarchical tag sets that are flexible enough toexpand/shrink according to the given applica-tions.
The hierarchical tag sets can be mappedto any other existing tag set as long as theyaxe decently classified, and therefore can en-coverage a corpus sharing in Korean taggingcommunity.
POSTAG is constantly being im-proved by expanding the morpheme dictionary,pattern-dictionary, and tagged corpus for statis-tical training and rule learning.
Since general-ized unknown-morpheme handing is integratedinto the system, POSTAG is a good tagger foropen domain applications uch as internet in-dexing, filtering, and summarization., and weare now developing a web indexer using thePOSTAG technology.Re ferencesE.
