COI~4~:RAUER and his group ( CF \[COLMF/~AUER & ai,73\],\[PASERO, 73\], \[COI~MERAUER, 79\]).
In these papers thesexnantics for natural languages is specified in termsof the truth conditions of predicate logic formulasinto which these utterances are translated in a sys-t~natic way.
( It should be n~ntioned that in manyrespects the way these translations are obtai ned aswell as the translations the~mselves resemble the evenearlier proposals of MONTAGUE and his students (cf\[MONTAGUE, 74\]).
The work done in COLMERAUER's grouphas however the additional merit that these proposalsare presented in operative syst~ns for nmn-machinodialogues.
Indeed in these early papers we find sket-ched two alternatives for the systs~mtic manipulationof the translations provided for natural languagediscourse:This research was supported in part by ESPRIT, in theACORD project(P393).a) given a data base in relational (e.g Prolog like )form the answers to queries (which are themselvestranslated into logical forms) ~n he given in termsof the satisfaction conditions of these formulas.
I.ea query like "does every student own a hook? "
willreceive the answer "yes" if its translation " for a\].lx (student(x) -> there exists y ( book(y)& own(x,y)))" is true in the data ~ise.
Here the answers to que-ries are obtained by simply evaluating the translationin the data base (or mode\].
)?b) another approach however consists in regarding thedata base as a set of fomaulas and the process of ans-wering a query as a deduction?

reasons which w~ sha\]l not spell out here we havechosen the ~ode\] the(met\]ca\] approach (\].e the firstapproach ) in OPERA?
Needless to say it: is not Loodifficult and in fact, sclnetimes necessary~ as we shallsee below, to c<mlpl6\]nent the pure se~nantic evaluationwith deductivo capacities..2- Sh:MANTICS VIA TRANS~TION IN'IY) LOGICEven if it is clear in nmst respects how to obtainpredicate logic: translaticms for a large w~riety ofnatura\] language sentences, cf \[WAR\[~FM & PEREIRA, 82\]we repeat here :\[or the sake of clarity the essentialsof the translation process in OPERA.Consider for c~ample the following sentences :(a) Berg a c<~npos6 un c~era en trois acres(Being composed an opera in three acts)(b) aucun c~upositeur gl.l~mnd n'a compos4 un operaen 1912(no german cc~poser composed an opera in 1912)(c) Chaque opera de Berg a dt@ ~\]registrd par Karajanevery opera by Berg was recordcw\] bY I~rajan.The syntax of ~?ERA (cf \[SEDOGBO, 85\]) yields syntac-tic analysis as in (d).These trees are then translated into the followingpredicate logic formulas :(a) exist(x,opera-in-three-acts(x) & compose(Berg,x))(b) aucun(x,composer(x) & german(x),exist(y,opera(y)& canpose-by(y,Berg) & in(y,1912)))(C) chaque(x,opera(x) & of(x,Berg),recorded-by(x,Karajan))23, - - - , , - - - , , - - - , , , , - - - , ,--V' ---AUX-=-a I---PAST---cf~npes4---OBJ---NP ....

Quite a few syntacticallycomplex queries can thus be formulated in this system.3- FROM TRANSLATIONS TO DRSsOPERA was conceived not so much as an effort towardsan implementation of viable integrated natural langua-ge question answering system, as a testing ground fora rather extensive fragment of French.
In fact manyconstructions ( in particular cc~plementconstructions ) which are accemodated in the syntaxfragn~nt of OPERA are such that they cannot effective-ly be applied in the setting of OPERA's data base.H(~ever there are quite a few constructions which canbe analysed syntactically in the gra~i r  but for whichwe are unable to specify translations, even when theirintended translations are essentially first-order lo-gic formulas.
Foremost among these are anaphoric andelliptical contructions.
It is clear' that any c~npre-hensive treatment of such phenomena cannot restrictitself to the analysis of isolated sentences i.e toisolated queries.
For what could a sentence like:when did he compose it ?mean ?
or what query could be expressed by the phrase"and Britten?
"?There is not much that these sentences could conveyin isolation.
But consider the following dialogue :Question: did Beethoven cazpose Fidelio ?Answer : yes.Question: when did he ccnkoose it?A/iswer: in 1812Or consider another very natural interaction :Question: how many operas did Beethoven compose?answer: 1Question: and Mozart?Answer : 15It is clear that an adequate account of anaphoric andelliptic constructions must at least take into accountthe current situation of the dialogue.
How to definethe notion " current situation" is by no means a tri-vial task.
For one thing we cannot simply asssume thatthe current situation is identical to the sequence ofthe question-answer pairs that make up the dialogue.Much more is involved.3.1 TOWARDS A TREATMENT OF ANAPHORA24Even though pronouns raise no probl~u at all as for ~as far as t~ syntax is concerned, no one has beenable to provide a unified and systematic account ofanaphoric linking.
As recent work has shown one mustdistinguish on the one hand various types of pronc~i-hal reference and on the other hand show how the reso-lution of anaphora must appeal to common Lmderlyingmechanisms.It is one of the achivements in \[KAMP, 81\] to show theway towards that unified treatment .In fact we shall base our proposals for beth thetreatment of m\]aphora and of ellipsis on the conceptsand technics introduced by KAMP in his theory of di-scourse representation.Since the current translation cx~mpenent of OPERA doesnot take into account pronouns at all we must firstprovide an extension which is also able to deal withpronominal referemce.
Syntactically pronouns can occurin all NP positions characterized bY the grammar?We shall 1~mrk each occ\[mence of a pronoun by indica-ting its gender/number features; As a first step inthe translation procedure we shall therefore simplytake these translations to he identical with themsel-ves.
Thus the translation of sentences like :Berg l'a composd(Berg c~mpesed it)will be :co, loose(Berg, \[it,null,sing\])similarly a sentence l i ke  :chaque cc~npositeur qui a compos4 un opera l'a enre-gistr4(every ccTmposer who wrote an opera recorded it).will be translated into :chaque(x,exist(y,opera(y)&composer(x)&c~npose(x,y)),record(x,\[it,null,sing\])))We shall call translations containing occurrences ofpronouns "unresolved translations".
Notice thatcontrary to the practice in \[MONTAGUE, 74\] we do notindex pronouns either in the syntax or the initialtranlation phase.
The resolution of anaphora will ta-ke as input "unresolve<\] translations" and yield asoutput a rather different type of s~nantic representa-tion namely a discourse representation structure(DRS).What is DRS?
In general we shall say that a DRS ispair consisting of a (possibly empty) domain of di-scourse referents U and a set of conditions CON.
Weshall for the present discussion take into considera-tion only three types of conditions :a) atc~nic conditions, which consists of n-ary predi-cate P and terms.a term is either a discourse referent or a propername; among the predicateswe single out the eqdality predicate "=".b) conditional conditions which have the form=>(kl,k2) where kl and K2 areagain DRSs.c) negative conditinal conditions which has the form#>(Kl,k2).In a more comprehensive treahnent Jt is clear that weshall need further types of conditions.Thus for the final translations of unresolved transla-tion we want to arrive at DRSs like the following :(a)Berg Loulouc~npose(Berg,Loulou)(b)- - i - - f  .........composer (x)opera (y)com~x\]se (x, y )__> recerd(x,y)There are precise truth definitions for DRSs which weshall not s\[~ll out here however (cf KAMP fordetails).
In any case the first DRS is logically equi-valent to the formula : compose(berg, loulou) and thesecond DRS is logically equivalent to the predicat lo-gic formula ~:chaque(x,(cha~ue(y,(cc~poser(x)&opera(y) &compose(x,y)) -> record(x,y)))What is interesting in the second example is of coursea fact that the pronoun "it" has as its syntactic an-tecedent the noun phrase "an opera ".
The se~qnticforce of this noun phrase cannot however be renderedin terms of an existential quantifier at \].east not ifwe want to establish an ~maphoric \]ink between theexistential quantifier and the variable representingthe pronoun in the consequent of the conditional.MO~I~AGUE for instance runs into this proble{n in Vi~where the pronoun is either left unbound or either isbound by the existential quantifier when the latteroccur outs i~  the conditional all together.
This widescope reading of the indefinite NP obviously givesthem the wr(mg interpretation.
As does of course thetranslation leaving the pronoun unbound.
In the DRS onthe other hand we get a universal reading for an operaas the result of the interpretation of the conditio-nal.Even though inside the antecedent of the conditionalwe treat the occurrence of the indefinite noun phrase"an opera " as we would in an ordinary indicative sen-tence, where of course ~le interpretation of the in-definite article corresponds more naturally to anexistential quantifier.
This is one of the features ofIQNMP theory that we shall tmke advantages of in thepresent proposal.As we said above we shall transform unresolvedtranslations stepwise into DRSs.
Needless to say wecould of coucse set up the translation procedure insuch a way that we obtain DRSs directly from the out-put of the syntactic component.
But this would entailmajor revision of the entire translation algorithn inany event the way we propose to derive DRSs can heregarded as DRS construction algorithm in its ownright.
On this view "our unre~uced translations" playthe role of an intermediate structure between syntaxand DRSsoAssume that t is an unresolved ~:anslation of a sen-tence .
We first generate K(t) the discourse represen-tation structure corres~:mding to t, in the followingway :if t is a univemsal tree i.e a formula of the fon~chaque---x--fl---f2we create a DRS K(t) with an empty donmin and thecondition => (KI,K2)oK1 will have x in his d~nain and the result of trans-forming fl in K1 as its conditionK2 will have an empty d~min  and the result of tran-:Forming :f2 as its c~onditions.Let t be a tree with the determiner "aucun" as itstop node, i.e a formula of the form :aucun---x---fl.... f2we procede as in the case above except that the condi-tion we emter into K(t) is now a negative universalcondition, i.e a condition of the form =>(kl,K2).Suppose t is dallinated by exist i.e t has the form :exist .... x.... flwe create a DRS K(t) whose domain contains x and weadd the result of traulsforming fl as the conditions toK(t).Suppose t is a tree dc~inated by "et"of the form :et---fl---f2i.e a formulawe create a DRS K(t) with an empty domain whoseconditions are the result of transforming fl and f2with respect to K(t).Finaly suppose the unresolved translation is nonquantifie~\] then we enter it as is into K and we addall occurrences of proper names into the domain of K.This provides the induction basis for the tranforma-tion.
Let K' k~ a DRS with dc~min U' and conditionsCON' and let t he a tree i.e a formula.
The result oftransforming t in K' is the application of the abovethree rules to t. When we no longer have any tree toprocess all conditions in the principle K i.e the DRSrepresenting the sentence to be transformed, as well25as all conditions occurring in the sub-DRSs of K willnow be conditions in the language of DRSs or atomicconditions containing occurrences of pronouns.How are these be eliminated ?Let us first consider an example the sentence"every composer dedicated an opera to a conductor thathe has admired"has as its unresolved translation:chaqui---xfl: ---ccmposer(x) If2: - - -ex i s t - - -y  f---exist---z I- - -conducter (z )  &opera(y) & ded icate(x ,y ,z )  &admire(he,z)We indicate the contruction of the DRS stepwiseK1(i)xcomposer (x)K2(2)K1 xcomposer (x --->K2 y zopera(y)conductor(z)dedicate(x,y,z)admire(x,z)(3)3.2 INCORPORATING DRS CONSTRAINTS INTO TRANSLATIONS?
o"We will give below the exact method for translatingformulas of OPERA into DRSs.One of the most important features of DR-theory is theprecise constraints on the antecedents of pronouns.Let K' be a DRS embedded in K (which is a DRS too);the antecedent of a pronoun occurring in K' is thelist consisting of the union of U(K) and U(K') if andonly if K is accessible to K'.For a precise definition of the notion of accessibili-ty cf \[GUENTHNER & I~HMAN,85\].Let us now illustrate the notion of accessibility bygiving the table of accessibility of the DRS above:~ DRS accessible I KK1 (I)By the transitive closhre of the accessibility rela-tion we obtain for example all the possible antece-dents of a pronoun occurring in K2 (e.g a pronounoccurring in K1 cannot have as antecedent a referentof K2).For the clarity of what will follow, we will call"unresolved predicate" (abreviated UP) a predicatewhose arguments included at least one pronoun.
Then toresolve an UP, one must replace the pronoun argumentswith appropriate referents accessible.The idea is to transport during the translation offormulas, a list of antecedents accessible accordingto DRSs constraints?How is this list to be constructed?As shown in (3.1) a universal tree is translated intoa DRS K= =>(KI,K2); the antecedent list of K which wenote L(K) is 6{npty.The antecedent list of K\] is L(K1) and L(K2) = U2 +L(K1) (we denote the union of sets by the symbol +).The existential tree is translated into K = \[U,CON\]and the antecedent list L(K)=U.Let f be a formula with "aucun" at its top node; f istranslated into the DRS K ~>(KI,K2).
The list of ante-cedents L(K) of K is empty and L(KI) is U1 and L(K2)=U2 + L(KI).Let us call a DRS containing "unresolved predicates"an "unresolved DRS".
Thus each unresloved DRS is apair of the form K = \[K,L(K)\] where L(K) is the ante-cedent list of the DRS K.To resolve an unresolved DRS, each unresolved predica-te (UP) must be resolved according to the followingmule :for an unresolved DRS K = \[K,L(K)\] with K=\[U,CON\] aUP P of CON is transformed into the logical predicateP"which  is obtained by unifying pronoun arguments ofP ih L(K).?
The example "every composer dedicated an opera to aconducter that he has admired" treated in session 3.1will illustrate how unresolved DRSs are resolved.Given the unresolved DRS K = \[K,nil\]withK= A>(kl,k2) , KI= \[Kl,x\], K1 = (x,ccrnposer(x))and28K2 = \[K2,(x,y,z)\] with K2= ((y,z,he),CON2), CON2 =opera (y) & conducter ( z ) &dedicate(x,y,z) & admire(x,he)K will he resolved by application of the rule descri-bed above, i.e: The pronoun he is \[mifiable in thelist (x,y) of antecedents, to z.
Therefore the unre-solved predicate will be translated into a~idre(x,z).4- EX'I~NDING THE DIALOGUE CAPACITY OF OPERAA proble~ arises in interrogating a data base in natu-ra\].
language which is the problem of dialogue situa-tion.
For example :(a) qui a c~t~posd Loulou (who composed \[mulou ?
)(b) oh est-il n4?
(where is he born?
)This dialogue can he translated into a DRS containingthe semantic representation of the two sentences.
Butif there is no interaction with the data base, theanaphoric link of the pronoun in (b) will be an un-bound variable and not for example the individual"Berg" (as Jt is Berg who c~nposedLoulou).What we prefer for a question-answering system is totake into account the situation of a question and itsanswer.A possible solution could be.
to consider that afterthe eval\[mtion of a query, its c~rresponding DRS istherefore instantiated (i.e.
its unbound variables arenow bound); in such a situation we loose the readingof the DRS as a logical formula and moreover we cannotrepresent the instantiation of a splitted DRS (e.g.
auniversal formula).4?1 q~E NCZI'ION OF A "CURRENT SITUATION DRS"The solution we proposed is to separate the DRS of aformula from the DRS for the situation.Let t be a formula and K(t) :\[U,CON\] its translationinto a DRS.The DRS of situation is the ORS K?
(n) = \[U?,CON?\]withU?
containing the instantiation of referents ofU,CON?
(~pty, and n denoting the current stateof the dialogue (i.e.
the occurrence of thequestion during the dialogue).The rule for UP resolution presented in the last ses-sion, must now be modified in the following way:let n be the current state of the dialogue and K bean unresol~<\] DRS; the antecedent of a pronoun occur-ring in K is containel in the list consisting of theconcatenati(xl of L(K) and L(K?
(n-I)).The antecedent list of K?
(i) is defined in the sameway as that a noraml O~5, i.e.
L(K?(i))=U?
(i).To illustrate what is abever we will treat the dialo-gue above:(a) is translated into the logical formulatl= Wh(x,c~\]npose(x,Loulou)); its translation into aDRS will produce K1.K1?x Imuloucompose ( x ,  Loulou )Since there is no prono<~n in KI, we can then evaluatethe formula tl.
After evaluation, we can build theDRS of situation K?:KI?
(1)Berg Loulou(b) will be tranlated into the logical formulat2 = Wh(y,bern( \[he,mas,sing\] ,y) )The unresolved DRS of t2 is K2 =\[K2..L(K2)\]withK2\[he,mas,sing\] ybern(he,y)and L(K) = y + L(K?
(2-1)) = \[y,Berg,Loulou\].To resolve K2, an antecedent must be substituted to"he"; this antecedent will be Berg (because argtunentsin OPFJtA are typed).The DP, S of situation becomes :K?
(2)Berg Vienne4.2 TREAI\[MENT OF ELJ~IPSISOne of the most con~aon \]phenomena of dialogue is ellip-sis such as in :(a) Berg a c~pos6 loulouBerg ca~Iposed Loulou(b) Britten aussiBritten tooor(c) et m%e symphonieand a symphonyThe interpretation of (b) is "Britten a cQuposdLoulou" (i.e.
VP-ellipsis); and (c) is to be interpre-ted as "Berg a compos6 tme symphonie".The ad hoc treatment proposed in \[SEDOGBO, 85\] failsin 1lmny cases; as we mentioned, since the logical for-mulas in OPERA are equivalent to first-order logicformulas.An interesting extension to VP-ellipsis in DR-theoryis described by KLEIN (cf \[KLEIN 84\])?KLEIN introduced the notion of predicate-DRS and pro-27posed an indexation of NP predicate-DRS and VPpredicate-DRS in a DRS.We will not propose here how this extended DRS can beimplemented; but will exploit the parallelism betweenour logical formulas and DRSs.Each sentence will be translated into two partial-logical formulas (noted PLF) of the form <x,f>, wherex is a variable or an individual and f a logical for-mula.We assume that the composition of PLF(NP) and PLF(VP)gives the translation of the sentence.The first PLF is implicitly indexed by the NP and thesecond PLF is indexed by the VP.The DRS of current situation must be modified in thefollowing way : K?
(n)= \[U?,CON?\] withU?
defined as above, and CON?
containig PLF(VP).Given a VP-ellipsis s, it will be translated into thethe PLF: <i,fl>.
The DRS of current situationcontains in its CON?
a PLF :<j,f2>.The VP-ellipsis is treated in the following way:i) ~lification of i and j2) the c~uposit i~ of <i,fl> and <j,f2> produces thetranslation t3) t is translated into a DRS K and K?
is built asdescribed in session (4.1)We will illustrate the VP-ellipsis treatment by pro-cessing the dialogue above:(a) is translated into the formulacompose(Berg,Loulou) and PLF(NP) = <Berg,Berg>,PLF(VP)= <i,cempose(i,Loulou)>.The translation t of (a) is then obtained by ccraposi-tion of PLF(NP) and PLF(VP); thust: compose(Berg,loulou).The evaluation of t will augment the dialogue situa-tion of a new DRS of situation containing PLF(VP).The translation of (b) will produce a PLF(NP)=<Britten,Britten> and a PLF(VP)= <i,p>.<i,p> will then be unified to the PLF(VP) contained inthe CON?
of K?
, i.e <i,p> is unified with<i,ccmpose(i,Loulou)>; the composition of the two PLF<Britten,Britten>, <Britten,canpose(Britten,Loulou)>will produce the logical formula"ccmpose(Britten,Loulou)".5- CONCLUSIONThe extensions to the OPERA system proposed here givea powerful dialogue capacities to OPERA.On the basis of the DR-theory, we propose an extensionfor the treatment of anaphora.
We do not treat herethe definite article as a definite refence since inour system the definite article must be interpreted asan indefinite article.
However notice that even if inthe framework of DR-theory the definite article is ex-plained as a definite anaphora, its anaphoric link re-quires often the use of deduction.
We prefer thereforenot to treat the definite anaphora.28The extension toel l ipsis described in this paper islimited to VP-ellipsis; in fact the other \]dnds of el-liptic sentences can be seen as conjoined to the pre-ceding sentences.
Even if the treatment proposed isnot the one described by KLEIN, the notion of partiallogic formula is equivalent to that of partial-DRS.In order to handle the dialogue we introduce the no-tion of a current situation DRS.But, is the level of logic translations (i.e our logi-cal formulas) necessary, since we translate these for-mu\]ms into DRSs?The reason to maintain this intermediate representa-tion is that our use of DRSs is only justified by theaccounting of the dialogue, so that we do not need thecomplex features of a DRS system.
Then for reason ofefficiency we think that it is better to evaluatetranslations on the data base (this enables the t~e ofan optimization algorithm before executing thequeries).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSthe author would like here to thank F.
