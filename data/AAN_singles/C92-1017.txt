It will be shown that the use of traces allowsfor an easier and more elegant way of descriptionthan competing approaches like ID/LP-format rulesas used e.g.
in GPSG and HPSG.
Grammkrs writ-ten in the TUG-formallsm can be compiled to a veryefficient parser.
The occurrence of head movement,wh-movement and scrambling in one sentence doesnot lead to any decrease in parsing efficiency.1 IntroductionThe basic motivation in creating TUG formalism wasto capture the empiric knowledge that represents theoutcome of at least 15 years' linguistic discussion ofGerman word order, while maintaining the efficiencythat is required from a grammar formalism of today'sstandard.
With reference to the basic work of \[Len77\]on marked and unmarked word order linguists in thegenerative tradition such as \[Thi82\], \[dB84\], \[Fau87\]and \[Cze87\] revealed an impreesive list of descrip-tive phenomena that can be appropriately handled bythe assumption of s conflgurational, i.e.
VP  contain-ing description of German word order.
Among thesephenomena count asymetries in the serialization be-haviour of nominatively marked NPs in passive andthe so called "psych" constructio*m*, the account forscrambling phenomena in Ac l /ECM Constructions 2and the observations of \[Cze87\] wrt.
to the voices ofdouble accusative verbs in German.
What  all theseworks intend is to pronounce the danger a descriptionof German is likely to run iuto, that "draws immedi-ate conclusions as to the surface position of argumet, tNPH on the basis of their surface cases" (\[dB84\]:59).t \[L~n77\] 0howl that v~rlm like w~ndcrn, ge.falle., #din#ca,etc.

Besides this basis, the main features of TUGare feature typing, mixing of attribute-value-pair and(PROLOG-) ternr unilication, flexible macros, unre~stricted disjunction attd special rule type~ for argu-ment and head movement,2.1 Bas ic  ru le  typesAs a very simple example we will look at the TUGversion of the example grammar in {Shi84\] z.9', type daflnitions => ~.np => f (agr :agrmnt).vp => f (agr :ag'~mt) .v => f (agr :agrmnt).agrmut => f (numbar:number,perton:ptrton) .number => {alnguler,plural).permon => {first,necond,thlrd}.% rules?

Second,TUG has a strict typing.
For a feature path to bewell defined, each of its attributes has to be declaredin tile type definition.3 For a Jlightly mor~ dctMled ~*eription f the bmdc fea-tures of TU(I refer to (\[Blo91\]).ACq'ES DE COLING-92, NAmXS.

23-28, 19922.2 Movement rulesFurther to these more standard UG-features, TUGprovides pecial rule formats for the description of dis-continuous dependencies, so called "movement rules".Two main types of movement are distinguished: ar-gument movement and head movement.
The formatand processing of argument movement rules is greatlyinspired by \[CLW88\] and \[Che90\], the processing ofhead movement is based on GPSG like slash features.2.2.1 Head MovementA head movement rule defines a relation between twopositions in a parse tree, one is the landing site, theother the trace position.
Itead movement is con-strained by the condition that the trace is the head ofa specified sister (the root node) of the landing site 4.Trace and antecedent are identical with the excep-tion that the landing site contains overt material, thetrace does'nt.To formulate head movement in TUG the followingformat is used.
First, a head definition defines whichcategory is the head of which other, e.g.
for the V-projection line of the above grammar:v is_head_of vp.vp is_head of s.Second, the landing site is defined by a rule likes '  ---> v+s I .
.
.where landing site and root node are linked by a +.To inclnde recursive rules in the head path, heads aredefined by the following head definitions.
In a struc-ture \[~\[ D1 .
.
.
D,\] Di is the head e l l ( i f  either Diis_head_of M is defined or Di has the same categoryas M and eitt*er D~ is_head_of X or X is_head_of Diis defined for any category X.2.2 .2  Argument  MovementArgument movenmnt rules describe a relation be-tween a landing site and a trace.
The trace is alwayse-commanded by the landing site, its antecedent.Two different traces are distinguished, anaphorictraces and variable traces.
Anaphoric traces mustfind their antecedent within the same bounding node,variable trace binding is constrained by sut~jaceney,c.a.
the binding of tim trace to its antecedent mustnot cross two bounding nodes.
Anaphoric traces arefound for example in English passive constructions\[s \[np Tim book of this author\]i was read t~\]wbereas variable traces are usually found in wh-constructions and topicalization.
Similar to the pro-posal in \[CLW88\], argument movement is coded inTUG by a rule that describes tim landing site, as forexample in4}Iere, "head of" is a transitive relation ~.t.
if x is head ofy and y is head of z then x is head of z.s2  - - -> np :ante<trace(var ,np : t race) ,  sl  Iante:fx = traee:fx,This rule states that rip:ante 5 is tile antecedent ofan np-trace that is dominated by sl.The first argument in the trace-term indicateswhether the landing site is for a variable (vat) orfor an anaphoric (aaa) trace.
Other than head move-ment, where trace and antecedent are by definitionidentical, the feature sharing of argument traces withtheir antecedents has to be defined in the grammar byfeature quations (ante : fx = t race  :fx, .
.
.).
Fur-thermore, it is not necessary that the antecedent andthe trace have the same syntactic ategory.The current version of the formalisms requires thatthe grammar contains a declaration on which cate-gories are possible traces.
In such a declaration itis possible to assign features to a trace, for examplemarking it as empty:t race(np)  I rip:empty = yee.Bounding nodes have to be declared as such in thegrammar by statements of the formbounding_node (rip).bounding_node(s) ~ s:tense = yes.As in the second case, bounding nodes may be de-fined in terms of category symbols and features.The main difference of argument movement toother approaches for the description of discontinuitieslike extraposition grammars (\[Per81\]) is that argu-ment movement is not restricted to nested rule appli-cation.
This makes the approach especially atractivefor a scrambling analysis of the relative free word or-der in the German Mi~telfeld as explained in moredetail below.3 Some fac ts  on  German syn-tax3.1 Bas ic  assumpt ionsIn the following we will sketch tile basic structuresof German syntax.

ID rulesdefine the hierarchical structure of constituents, LPrules the linear ordering of daughters constituents.In this paradigm the german Miftelfeld inelu'ding thefinite verb typically is supposed to form a fiat struc-ture, generated by an ID rule like a - - ->  np \ [no~,np \ [akk \ ] ,  np \ [dat \ ] ,  v \ [~ ln \ ] ,  vk \ [ in f in \ ]  r. The ele-ments on the right hand side can then be (partially)ordered by LP statements of the form v f : f i~  < up0np< vk (a finite verb precedes an NP, a VK followsan NP).
As no LP statement is made for the NPs, therules generate all possible permutations of NPs.
(13) Is hat dot Mann der Frau d~ Buch gegeben\]\[8 hat dex Frau der Mann d~ Bach gegeben\]Is hat das Buch der Mann der Fran gegeben\]Is hat der Fran du  Buch der Mann gegeben\]\[s hat der Mann du  Buch der Fran gegeben\]So, where TUG supposes a fixed unmarked wordorder, from which marked orders are derived by move-ment rules (scrambling), GPSG and ItPSG supposeunordered ID rules and express constraints on orderexplicitly by LP Statements.
The same holds for theposition of the finite verb in the different german sen-tence types.
As for movement to the Vorfeld theGPSG/HPSG approach using the slash feature andthe TUG approach are rather similar, as in fact move-ment is implemented in TUG by structure sharing.3 .3  Some more  fac ts  on  German syn-taxIn the following paragraph we will outline a few de-scriptive phenomena where we think the use of traces?But ace \[Reag9\] for an alternative approach using LP-itatementa hat do?4 not have to Msume a fiat etructure.as in TUG allows for more elegant formulations ofthefacts.3.3,1 P repos i t ion  s t rand ingIn many German dialects, prepositional proforrrm likedamd or dsoegsn and question forms like vaornit orwofefen can be used discontinuously.
Both the slashanalysis and the movement to the Vorfeld are ableto describe appropriately sentences like (14b.
), wherethe pronoun part of a prepositional preform is de-tached from its preposition.
(14) a. Damit kann er diese Theorie wider-legen.Therewith can he thin theoryde~ea~b.
Da kann er dices Theorie mit wide~legen.There can he th i s  theory  withde feat"With th~ he ean de~at he theory"Whereas the preceding data give strong evidencefor movement into the Vet.reid, preposition strandingin German is not restricted to that position.
Theda of a discontinuous preform can also occur in theMiftelfeld.
(15) a. Er kann diese Theorie damit wider-legen.He can th in  theory  therewi thde feat .b.

Therefore, da and mit wouldhave to be of the same constituent as diese Theorie.But in 14 (a) damit obviously forms one constituent.It is unclear how in a flat structure the obligatorinessof da can be expressed, an effect that naturally fallsout of the trace approach.AcrEs DE COLING-92.

19923.3.2 The  pos i t ion  o f  p ronounsThe word order of personal pronouns in the Germansentence is rather estricted as exemplified by the fol-lowing sentences.

*7daft ihnder  Chef ihr vorstellt* that  h i s \ [ace \ ]  the boss her \ [dat \ ]presentsg.
*daft ihn ihr er vorstellt*that hi=\[ace\] her\[dat\] he\[sol\]presantsEven though it might be possible to describe theserestrictions by a set of LP statements, our impressionis that this kind of analysis obscurs the rather simplepronoun word order.
Furthermore, we cannot see howLP rules could allow for (a) and (e) while excluding(f)a. Ihn may preceed the nominativ NP, but only ifthere is no dativ pronoun following the latter, sIn our analysis, personal pronouns have a fixed po-sition in the sentence ither between S1 and S or be-tween S und VP.
(is) a.
\[s a \[st daft esl ihrj \[s tier Mann \[vl, tj\[v, t, aibt\]\]\]\]\]b.
\[s a \[st daft \[s tier Mann esl ihr i \[vP tj\[Va t, gibt\]\]ll \]3.4  AC I -const ruct ionsIn ACI-coustructious however a personal pronounmay very well follow a non-nominativ NP.
Compare(17e.)
and (19).s (f) seems to be somehow acceptable in some dialects butcompletely agrammatical in others.
?As far as we understand it, also a solution by sequenceunion \[Rea89\] could not account for these facts.
(19) a. Gestern hat Karl den Jungen ihr helfenla88en.
?ss ts rday  has Kar l  the boyher \ [dat \ ]  he lp  le t"Yesterday Karl has made the boy helpher"b. Gestern hat Karl den Jungen \[ve ihrhelfen\] lassen.To save an LP analysis as indicated above we wouldhave to say that ihr helfen is part of another con-stituent as den Jungen, therefore the LP statementsdo not hold between den Jangen and ihr.
The struc-ture of the sentence (19a) might then be sketched asin (19b).But now consider the following sentence:(20) Gestern hat sieh Karl eine L~sung sin-fallen l~sen.Yesterday has Karl himself asolution come_to~ind letThis sentence, although it repreeents a regular ACI-construction and consequently must have an embed-ded VP constituent, shows the same serialization wrt.the pronoun as (17), where all NPs belonged to thesame constituent.
ID and LP rules therefore lead to acontradiction i handling (19) and (20) t?.
A TUG de-scription on the other hand can make use of a scram-bling analysis in (20).
The pronoun sich leaves a tracein the pronoun position of the embedded construc-tion and appears in the appropriate pronoun positionof the matrix constituent, thereby maintaining therelevant serialization conditions in both constituents.And a further restriction may be implemented whenconfigurational relations are available: the scramblingof a dative pronoun out of an ACI-coustruction asshown in (20) is sensitive as to whether the accusativeof the ACI-verb replaces an external or internal nom-inative of the embedded verb.
Finite cinfallen marksits nominative internally, finite half ca marks it ex-ternally.
Only internal nominative-accusatives allowbeing scrambled over, cf.
(20) with (21).
(21) *Gestern hat ihr Karl den Jungen helfenlassen.
*Yesterday has hsr \ [dat \ ]  Kar l  theboy help let3.4.1 Scrambl ing  and  Themat ic  S t ructureAnother aspect of the configurational differentiationbetween external and internal arguments can be madeuse of in analysing the thematic structure of a sen-tence.
So e.g.
the thematic differentiation betweenwide and narrow scope of a verbal argument dependson its appearing in marked or unmarked position.Compare the readings of (22) and (23) vs. (26), whereboldface marks the posodically prominent syllable:10A description like the one in \[Rea89\] would presumablyhave to state that verbs like h?lfen are combined in ACI-constructions by concatenation~ verbs like tin\]allen by se-quence union.A~q'ES DE COL1NG-92.

"(23) Ich glaube dab dem Vorstand er Kollegewidersprochen hat.I think that the board thecollegue contradicted has"1 think that the colluege has contradictedto the board.
"(22) is a possible answer to the question what hap-pened on the meelmg yesterday whereas (23) is onlyallowed in specific contexts such as Wet hat demVorstand widersprochen?.
Widersprcchen like helfeamarks its nominative xternally, therefore the dativeNP follows the nominative NP in the umnarked wordorder as shown in (22).
If scrambling applies as in(23) this correlates with a change in the thematic andprosodic structure.
In the TUG framework this wouldbe achieved in combining the scrambling mechanismwith a feature structure that indicates the desiredthematic interpretation of the sentence:(24) vp - - ->  np<tracs (ana ,np : t race) ,vp:hh : S C ope=narro~;,(25) vp ---> np, v~.np: scope=vp : scope.A straightforward implementation f this observa-tion in the ID/LP format however would come to ahalt in the case of (26):(26) Ich glaube dab dem Vorstand die LSsungeingefallen ist.I think that the board thesolution come_to_mind has"I think that the solution has come tomind to the board.
"Although the nominative follows the dative in (26)the sentence has wide scope interpretation and un-marked prosodic structure 11 , (26) again is a likely an-swer to the general question Was ist gestern passiert?This clearly contradicts (22)-(23) if only the surfacecase marking of the arguments can be referred to inthe generalization.
On the other hand this result isexactly what would be expected by a TUG analy-sis: Since einfallen marks its nominative internally,no scrambling is involved in (26) vs. (23).11 John Pheby in \[HFM81\] poatulates the distinction betweenmaxked and unmarked prosodic structure inGennaaa.
\[vSU86\]combine this with a configurational syntax.
See also \[Uhm91\]for a reformulation ofthe relevant obeservations in the frame-work of \[Pie80\].4 Pars ing wi th  TUGTUG can be processed by a parser and a generator.Before parsing and generation, the grammar is coat-piled to a more efficient form.
The first compilationstep that is common to generation and parsing trans-forms the attribute-value-pair st ucture to (PRO-LOG) term structure.
This transformation makes useof the type definitions.
For parsing, TUG is processedby a Tomita parser \[Tom86\].
For usage in that parserthe result of the transformation to PROLOG furtherundergoes several transformations (expansion of headnlovement rules, transformation of argument move-ment rules, elimination of empty productions, conver-sion to LR.
(K) format and computation of LR tables).This compilation leads to a considerable increase inprocessing speed that makes it possible to use TUGfor the syntactic description in real-timesystems.
Es-pecially the seperatc ompilation of head movementaml argument movement leads to run time grammarsthat do not show the usual decrease in efficicncy dueto empty productions (traces).
In fact, a compiledTUG does not contain empty productions any longer.Parsing time for simple sentences of about 10 wordsusing a grammar of German with rather broad cov-erage is between 1 and 2 sees.
on the average on aSUN SPARC I workstation running Quintus Prolog,even if the sentence contains verb fronting, argumentmovement to the Vorfeld and scrambling in tile Mit-telfeld,5 Conc lus ionWe have presented Trace & Unification Grammar,  agrammar formalism that tries to bridge the gap be-tween UG and GB theory with the aim of adoptingmany of the linguistic descriptions of German foundin the linguistics literature.
Besides German, the pre-sented grammar formalism has also been used suc-cessfully to describe a smaller subset of Chinese.
Wehave compared TUG descriptions of some phenomenain german syntax to approaches that do not make useof movement rules but use \ [D/LP rules instead andshown that in all these cases TUG provides a sim-ple and elegant description whereas the ID/LP ap-proach in most cases even fails to describe the data atall.
Furthermore we have briefly mentioned tile wayTUG can be compiled to an efficient parser.
Em-pirical tests have shown that using movement rulesand traces does not lead to a considerable decrease inparsing speed.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Ping Peng, Manfred Gehrke,l~udi Iiunze and Ludwig Schmid for many discus-sions Oil tile TUG-formalism.
