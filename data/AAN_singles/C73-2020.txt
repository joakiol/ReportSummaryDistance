PETER KOMMEI,AN ALGORITHM OF LIMITED SYNTAXBASED ON LANGUAGE UNIVERSALSAbstract.Hundreds of differentiated syntactic rules as well as all kinds ofphrase structures and conventions are dispersed over more than fiftystill existing natural anguage systems.
On the contrary meanings, re-presented by nouns, verbs and adjectives are internationally identical.Only the way they are carried and expressed by various national lan-guages differs.
Thus a fundamental division into two parts representsthe main feature of the ALCO~ITHM OF IMITED SYNlrAX (A~S).
This A~S-Division of natural anguage systems provides two groups of words:a) words representing nouns, verbs and adjectives as so called~ content words )) or more easily nominated as RADICALS andb) words expressing syntactic features and functions, the SYN-TAX-PAR TICLES.While the human treasure of knowledge in form of meaningsexpressed by content-words is in no way curtailed by ALS-Rules, thevast .jungle of still existing syntactical features and syntagms will bedrastically cooked down to the essentials.
Thus the A~s-Rules com-prehend several aws to limit syntagms, which are made clear by al-gorithms or verbal definitions.
Still the limitations enforced by A~S-Rules are based on language universals and thus keep all information-expressions and -performances in the scope of a natural languagesystem.1.0.
Aims and the unconventional character of approach.Significance and necessity to solve the problems concerning Auto-matic Translation between different national anguages as well as factretrieval, justifies all possible approaches.
Worldwide pessimism (M.15226 PnT~R KOMMI~LL.
MmsxY, 1968, p. 24 f) relating to this enterprise ten to twenty yearsago (N. CHOMSXY, 1965, p. 163) has been in no way without foundation(3(.
BAR-HILL~L, 1940, p. 271 and G. SALTON, 1968, p. 156 f).
A Forma-lization of natural anguage systems seems for the ftrst step unavoidable,if the three fundamental goals:1.
AUTOMATIC TRANSLATION2.
AUTOMATIC FACT I~ETRIEVAL and3.
ARCHIVAL HARD STORAGE, a once and for good storage ofhuman information in form of facts, are aimed at.In the thirties L. BLOOMPmLD published a very significant idea(1935, p. 208) of dividing natural anguage systems among others intothose ofa) agglutinated morphologies andb) those of isolated morphologies.While English, French, German and R.milan belong to systems ofagglutinated morphologies - the morphological structures are gluedtogether - Chinese, ideographic-, pictographic- and gesture languagesystems bear an isolated one.
When dealing especially with phenomenaof isolated morphologies, two points become very clear:1.
The multitude of syntagms i.e.
syntactic features and patternscoming with agglutinated systems are considerably reduced to thevery important ones.2.
The mostly visually to perceive xpression units - permanentas well as acute - (grams and gestures), are highly content related,thus helping to look behind the scenery of language xpressions intothe material of content-phenomena and semantic relations.Up to fifty or more existing different language systems can beconsidered as morphologically and syntactically differentiated expres-sion - and carrier - systems for only one and the very same informationtreasure, the treasure of human knowledge.
So it is necessary tounify expression - and syntax - habits.
In order to unify and subse-quently limit especially the number of existing syntagms, it pays offto be very careful when making artificial curtailments.
The best waystill is to lean on natural prototypes, which lead back to the Bloom-fieldian division (L. BLOOMn~.LD, 1935, p. 208):AN ALGORITHM OF LIMITED SYNTAXagg l .

The vast jungle of syntagms in segmentA hinders the extraction of those syntagms which are of most signific-ance concerning language universals.
They are too much covered andhidden by conventional balast of low-value syntagms (Fig.

2.The number of possible syntactic algorithms to construct sentencesin all existing natural anguages i finite, but still at the present state"uncontrollable " and thus not computable (G. SALTON, 1968, p. 191).Obeying this fact of nature, efforts led to the conclusion, ot to operateon sentences of natural language as they exist now, but to form a ruleand a recipe to conceive sentences, which are:228 PETER KfiMMEL1.
natural in character and2.
easy to formalize and compute.Even if limited in syntactic patterns, natural anguage systems areeasy to employ because of being available and programmed al-ready in the brains of human beings.
Interpreting the criteria for naturallanguage systems (J. H. GRE~N~ERG, 1968, p. 110 if), it is trivial to rea-lize that certain systems, up to now mostly out of regard, deliver con-tributions of syntactical features highly valuable for the whole enter-prise.
Those syntactical features of limited but natural expressionsystems are mainly extracted from language systems of isolated mor-phology as shown in Fig.
3, e to m. But the entire operation to limitsyntagms and form algorithms must be stopped by one certain point,which prevents it from crossing the boundaries from natural to artificiallanguage systems (Fig.
3).
This boundary has been easily pinpointedby following the rules of a work published one year ago.
In this pub-lication a distinct separation between atural and artificial anguagesystems has been made per definitionem (P. KOMM~L, p. 86):Definition: NATURAL LANGUAGEA language is natural in its character, ifa) the number of using individuals is larger or equals one millionheads andb) the period of use is larger or equals one life span of a usingindividualga C7" ~Natural Languages~'o~ ~?

3.AN ALGORITHM OF LIMITED SYNTAX 229The remainder of language systems can be considered artificial.Artificial also insofar as a few native language systems, presently only usedby some thousand individuals, have a too limited number of users andthus lack the natural momentum.
Within the scope of natural languages(Fig.
3, e to m) a rather wide gap exists between d and e. The closera language system is located to the boundary between atural and arti-ficial system (Fig.
3, m/n), the easier it becomes to formalize it, as thebalast of conventional syntactic rules fades away.
So it paid off quiteheavily to analyze language carrier systems especially from e to m(Fig.
3).
It is a pity that so few linguists have involved themselves withlanguage systems of isolated morphologies a  shown in e to m in Fig.3.
This fact explains why the author of this publication has to referto eight of his own publications in the reference literature.The language systems in Fig.
3, e to m are natural in characterand still after the Bloomfieldian definition of isolated morphology.Thus they are easier to formalize.
They represent:e) Children Expression Systemsf) Adult Foreigner Expression Systems, as found among touristsor guest-labourers with a very limited vocabulary treasure and almostno knowledge of syntactical patterns.
Habits practiced by adults whoare forced to maintain dialogs in foreign languages without preparatorystudy.
Language of people who stay only a limited time in foreigncountries.g) Aviation Control Communication Language as used betweenthe pilot and tower personal.h) Chinese for the audible perception.i) Chinese in written form for the visual perception.j) Ideography and ideographic expression systems uch as Hiero-glyphs, etc.k) Gesture Expression Systems as for example deaf-mute, indianand nomadic gestures for the acute visual perception.1) Pictographic Expression Systems as found in traffic signs, etc.In) Japanese KANGO Expression Systems, a form of ideogramsequences referring back to Chinese.A conglomerate of universals in syntactical features to be foundespecially in the preceding language systems e to m but also amongthose of a to d (Fig.
3) is filtered and concentrated, to retain syntac-tic phenomena, characterized by the highest frequency of occurrence(Mc.
D. NEIr~L, 1971, p. 40).
Thus an ALGORITrIM OF LIMITED SYNTAX(ALS) in the form of several fundamental syntagms i gained, which pre-230 PETER KI3MMELserves a full scale consolidation of the natural momentum and enablesthe user to feel familiar at once.The Preceding details led to a somewhat unconventional pproachcharacterized by the following three features:1.
In order to apply a few and most essential syntactical algo-rithms for natural anguages, the content metric of one meaning isenlarged.
S~ANNON/W~AWa'S information measurement (entropy/bit)has been extended by evaluating eight content criteria or so calledsub-criteria of one information unit, one meaning or one RADICAL(P. KOMMEL, 1972 a, p. 64 if): 1.
Identity, 2.
Truth, 3.
RADICAL-Value, 4.
Age, 5.
Common Frequency, 6.
Relative Frequency, 7.Priority and 8. the Interlogging Value.2.
A conglomerate of syntactic universals found especially incontent-related natural language systems is cooked down to the es-sentials in form of a few syntactical lgorithms with highest frequencyof occurrence.
This conglomerate in cooperation with the newly con-ceived content evaluation (1) is called: ALGOraTaM Or LIMITED SYNTAx3.
The amalgamation of the preceding features (1) and (2) inform of the very .~LS serves for a case study.
This case study involvesan execution of Archival Hard Storage, Automatic Fact Retrieval andAutomatic Translation of Natural Languages.
It covers a small mole-cular scope of human knowledge centered around the meaning " SandGlass" and the "father - son - relation ".
Those artificial questionanswering systems on structural and functional phenomena of thedomain " Sand-Glass" as well as the "father - son - relation " can beconsidered a recipe for automated handling of the remaining humanknowledge treasure on earth.
Concessions to be made appear in the formof stereotype syntactical patterns, which affect the esthetic momentumbut not the transmission flux of information.
A natural text to be com-puted is conceived after application of the easy to learn and easy tolimit ALS-kules, which makes it natural in character.
Present day usedtexts of Natural Languages must be rewritten.2.0.
A RADICAL, the newly conceived content unit and its sub-criteriain the ALS-system.In 1928 Hartley originated the idea of demonstrating the canal capa-city of a system mathematically.
He put the logarithm of the sumAN ALGORITHM OF LIMITED SYNTAX 231concerning all possible situations equal to the information capacity(R. v. L. HARTLEV, 1928, p. 535 f).
Later this was reversed by Shannonand Weaver.
In respect o the probability of choice Weaver stated:"The actual expression for information is " (W. W~AVER, 1964, p. 14) :H = - loe p,Expressed by the logarithm dualis in bits Shannon declared the proba-bility of occurrence to be high, if the information value is small.
Incase the probability of occurrence reaches 1 the information equals O.t (a,) = - ld  = 0 bitConsequently if p = 0, it will cause the information to become inde-finite (C. E. SHANNON, 1964, p. 63):I (a~)=- ldO=oo bitThis calculation, which is analogous to the entropy evaluation ofthermostatisfical data was used (1963) by Beer to express the dimensionsof information values by bits.
He associates everal different inscrip-tions on train windows with the corresponding information value(S. BEER, 1963, p. 65):Do not lean out of the window 137.75 bitsE perieoloso sporgersi 104.50 "Lisfarligt art luta sig ut 128.25 "Ne pas se pencher aus dehors 128.25 "Nicht hinauslehnen 85.50 "Since that time, developments have shown that a strict limitation toonly this kind of content evaluation might lead into a blind alley.Bit evaluations are sufficient under certain circumstances to measurecarrier systems and signs as their units, but they fall absolutely shortin the determination of contents in the form of information.
A newlyborn scientific fact or an invention represents one meaning and can benamed with one sentence, one word or even one sign.
This meaningstands for an information unit and is criticized by more than the value"improbability of occurrence ", which might come close only to No6 of the eight content criteria.232 PETER KUMMELAn information unit, represented by an abbreviated noun, verb, oradjective in lemma- or better said stem - form, is called RADICAL .A RADICAL  is the main and only component in ALS - sentences be-sides the particles.
The PARTICLES carry exclusively syntacticalfunctions.
A RADICAL  can be subdivided into eight further sub-criteria, which also are to be enumerated.Quite well known among Orientalists and about 1 billion asiaticpeople are the so called RADICALS,  after which composed ChineseCharacters can be classified (P. Kt~MM~L, 1966, p. 110 f).
The systemof  RADICALS delivers for the information theory as well as Semanticsof natural anguages a highly valued contribution to form sub-criteriaof one meaning.
In other words they represent the interlacing-, entan-gling- or involving-value of one meaning to others.
With the aid ofRADICALS several sub-criteria of one meaning can be formalizedand enumerated to a 100% degree of precision.
Below, five examplesof Chinese RADICALS are given in connection with several composi-tive characters, in which the RADICAL  represents one component:RADICALS:  Composed Characters:l'~ ,HIssel----- ~.

"There are already existing expression systems in Natural Languages,?
saddle, ~'f~ whfpGo-Stone (a game).~,~ to continue,?
'~%" to seg ~:~ receive, i .which come close to Ars-habits.
Besides the Chinese expression systemfor example the Japanese KANGO-System is known.
~means literally " Chinese words ".
In a Japanese text theoretically allparticles have to be eliminated, in order to generate a KANGO-Text.
For example: The sentence: The car runs fast can be written:t 2 3AN ALGORITHM OF LIMITED SYNTAX 233If 1 the nominative particle, 2 the adjective particle and 3 the verl~-suffix are oMtted, it results in ~,~ ' - ,  ,?~,  out of which still tilesame meaning is understood.
Examples for used KANGO-Expres-sions in Japanese are: ,,,,~.
\ ] ~  d!~c.lt o park,, or: ")~")__~, x~ "~an electrical express train.
Both KANGO-Expressions were conceivedafter the fifties.Finally, the use of RADICALS with a limited number of PAR-TICLES comes not only close to CHINESE and Japanese KANGO-Texts, but also offers the opportunity to subdivide one RADICAL-into several content-criteria.The eight sub-criteria of a RADICAL:1.
IDENTITYA new information unit can be interpreted and integrated here andthere.
It can be filed here and there.
The identity is implemented bythe RADICAL-Number (Deuterziffer) (P. KOMM~r,, 1972 b, p. 483 f).The first meaning in the human treasure of knowledge receives thenumber 1.
The RADICAL-Number is implemented at a graph'svertex (Fig.
4) in the way of decimal fractures used for decimal classi-fications.
The RADICAL  represents a vertexto the origill-~  i i i .

TR UTHIf a new information represents a perpetuum-mobile or a productof fantasy, it has to be marked false.
The truth is implemented intothe treasure of knowledge graph by even numbers making use of theIDENTITY-Numbers under 1.
If the truth is not existing and animplementation has to be done, odd RADICAL-Numbers are pro-vided.3.
RADICA1,-VALUEIt is more or less related to existing information, which makes itattached as a green bud to thicker or thinner branches of the informa-tion graph (Fig.
5).
The RADICAL-VALUE is also to comparewith theFig.
5.distribution ability of a vertex (P. K/JMMI%, 1969, p, 64 if) and thus isidentical to the number of strings in the vertex loop (Fig.
6).
TheRADICAL-VALUE is written in brackets at the RADICAL-Loop orthe vertex.
For more detail see P. KOMra~L (1972 b, p. 481 f) andP.
KOMMEL (1972a, p. 36 f).

6.AN ALGORITHM OF LIMITED SYNTAX 2354.
AGEIf an information unit or RADICAL turns out to be not new, theexact age has to be determined.
The implementation f age is done bychronological numbers, starting with 1 for the oldest and furnishingthe highest in use for the latest RADICAL.
Secondly the age of aRADICAL may be determined in relation to a known time-calendar.So it receives a birth-date.5.
COMMON FREQ UENC YIfa RADICAL is already known, it can be classified by its commonfrequency since its birth.
The COMMON FREQUENCY is imple-mented by numbers indicating the occurrences of counts (P. Ki)M~L,1968 b, p. 242 if).6.
RELATIVE FREQUENCYIn comparison to others, one information occurs for practical useoftener or not.
The information unit with the highest relative occur-rence is designated with the number one (1).
Another of half of thatrate by 1/2 and so on (P. KOMMEL, 1968 b, p. 242 if).
The Relativefrequency substitutes more or less Shannon/Weaver's Bit-Metric.7.
PR IORITYA larger or smaller importance compared to other meanings isindicated by a number which states the surface tension of a RADICAL-Graph in those places, where the surface is grown unregular (Fig.
7).The vertex A is located close to a surface area where high tensionexists (see arrows !).
It owns a higher PRIORITY-Value than the knotsB and C. The PRIORITY-Value is measured in percent.
If the tensionon the RADICAL-Cluster236 P~T~R ~OMMELFig.
7.
(see arrows !)
is strong enough, the PRIORITY-Value can reach up to100% (P. K/~MSfEL, 1972 b, p. 483).8.
INTERLOGGING-VALUEAn individual associates with a certain meaning (RADICAL) anothermeaning, which lies far away from the Cluster-Branches of the firstconcern (Fig.
8).
Thus this association cannot run along neighbouringbranches, but jumps to a RADICAL-Loop far away via the dotted lines{H:  - .
.
.
.
.

8.(Fig.
8).
The extent of the INTERLOGGING-Value is given by thedistance of the dotted line, to be measured by the differences of the Iden-tity-Value in the l~adical-Cluster.
Secondly the INTERLOGGING-Value depends on the number of interlogging- and distance-jumps viadotted lines, in other words by the number of dotted lines.AN ALGORITHM OF LIMITED SYNTAX 237Definition: RADICALA RADICAL represents a meaning, which can be subdivided intoso called sub-criteria or RADICAL-Criteria.
The RADICAL repre-sents the counter-part to the PARTICLE in ALs-Texts.
It carries themeanings of nouns, verbs and adjectives.
For automatic translationpurposes a RADICAL is translated exclusively into different nationallanguages.3.0.
The PARTICLES, a limited number of syntagms permitted in theALS-System.The human knowledge isto be considered asa huge cluster of now-adays not less than several million RADICALS.
But a language, funct-ioning as a carrier system for information and thus single RADICALS,is always composed of syntagms too.
These syntagms finally combinesequences of RADICALS to sentences of Natural Language Systems.They can be reduced to a minimum of units, but may not be neglectedentirely.
A very carefully done and delicate process of limiting downthe syntagms resulted in a concentrated stockpile of abbreviatedPARTICLES integrated into the ALS-I~ules.
The PARTICLES areabstract in their character and each embodies a motion in the branchesof the RADICAL-Cluster.
Consequently the use of a PARTICLEreleases an electrical process within an associative hardware storage.The PARTICLES in isolated form do not supply much information.They become useful only when appearing in connection with RADI-CALS.
As some examples of elementary PARTICLES can be consi-dered:1.
/(quest.
)/for question and2.
/(pret.
)/for preteritum or past tense.Definition: PAR TICLEIn ALs-Texts the PARTICLE represents the counterpart to theRADICAL.
A PARTICLE serves as a fundamental syntagm exclu-sively syntactical functions.
The PARTICLE is considered a concen-trate of internationally universal syntactic rules.
For automatic transla-tion purposes the PARTICLE is not translated, thus appearing ininternationally understood abbreviated forms of Latin or Greek.238 p~.T~.a ~OMM~.L4.0.
Fundamental rules of the algorithm of limited syntax divided intosingle paragraphs.In order to use ALS, conventional sentences must be transformed toheteronoms with the maximum size of a fivefold-heteronom.
Differentfrom other approaches to the same project, where at least 172 syntac-tic features must be taken into consideration (T. WINOGAD, 1972,p.
173 f), AtS limits the formalism by permitting only stereotype pat-terns.
These patterns include contextual rules within the nominal-sequences of up to five nouns.
Only a restricted number of PARTI-CLES within the fivefold-heteronom is permissible.
ALs-Formalismsare based on the " Grundregeln der Formalgrammatik" (P. KOMM~L,1972b, p. 485) as well as on details described in the "Deuterfolgen-Grammatik" (P. KOMlVmL, 1972a, p. 76 ff and 83 f).
The main rulesof  ALS are classified in paragraphs:1 All expressions of Natural Language must be divided into RADI-CALS embodying meanings and PARTICLES representing syntacti-cal function.2 Each RADICAL has to appear in sentences with an abbreviated morpho-logy, in stem-pattern or lemma-form.3 All expressions must be cast into sequences of RADICALS similarto heteronoms.
Example: glove = mononom, Handschuh = binomin form of a heteronom.4 Each of these heteronoms may not exceed the size of a fivefoldnomen.In other words, a sentence may not include more than five RADI-CALS.
Example of a maximum: /train/terminal/station-master/office/telephone/.5 Each of these heteronoms according to ~ 4 is to carry one meaningin form of an information unit.6 The meaning of a sentence in the form of a heteronom is always to betaken out of the last RADICAL, while the preceding ones only servefor more detailed specifications.
Example: /information/bank/meansbank or accumulation place.
But/bank/information/means news fromor about banks.7 Each meaning according to ~ 5 has to be analyzed by the eight con-tent criteria (P. KOMMEL, 1972a, p. 69 f) and (P. KOMM~L, 1973b,p.
482 if).Additionally they must be translatable into all existing natural languages.8 Each meaning or RADICAL according to \] 7 must be furnished witha national language identification number for example 1-10 belongingAN ALGORITHM OF LIMITED SYNTAX 239595 10511125 135,45 is365 17~8195 20to the most relevant national language systems on earth (see 5.3 below !
).Thus for translation purposes the adequate expression sequences belong-ing to each identification umber can be provided.The heteronoms according to ~ 4 exist of conventional nouns, as wellas substantivated verbs and substantivated a jectives as nouns.
Exam-ple: ... gives the money =/moneytransfer/ or sunny day =/sunday/etc.All RADICALS according to 1 and 3 should be possibly limited totheir lemma patterns respectively shortest understandable form.
Exam-ple: Automobile = auto or television set = TV-  set.Each RADICAL in lemma-pattern should not surpass the length ofa certain sequence number of letters, which is stated here with 20 let-ters.Each RADICAL within a heteronomic sentence must be writtenwithin vertical ines.
Example:/father/.Longer sentences of conventional text can be reduced to several hete-ronoms by rewriting.
As an example see the text of Newsweekbelow:According to the chainstitch-method (P. KOMM~r, 1972a, p. 77 and 85)as well as recursive functions (P. KOMMEL, 1972b, p. 485, ~ 4) one RA-DICAL of the preceding heteronom is chained into the following one.Example: The father living in London gives the son studying in Paris money.1.
A threefold heteronom:/father/London/living/, 2.
A threefold hete-ronom: /father/son/moneytransfer/ and 3.
Another threefold hetero-nom:  /son/Paris/study/.Heteronoms of concrete value end with a concrete noun or RADI-CAL.
Example: /motor-car/door/.
Heteronoms with an abstractvalue end with an abstract noun.
Example: /motor-car/delivery/.Necessary PARTICLES expressing for example time, questions, etc.,must not be placed behind the last RADICAL of the heteronom.
Exam-ple: The father gave the money: =/father/(pret.)/moneytransfer/.
2.Does the train leave at 12 : 30 h?
--/train/12 : 20 h/(quest.
)/depart/.PARTICLES have to be written in brackets.
Example see ~ 16!Serving the purpose of automatic translation all PARTICLES mustbe expressed in Latin, Greek or an internationally known abbreviatedletter sequence, because PARTICLES will not be translatable in the^Ls-System.The pronoun, which normally represents a noun, always has to be re-placed by the originally substituted noun.
Example: Little Joe doesnot say: " I  want to eat ", but:/Joe/want/eat/.
Or, the pilot does not say:ledg " /C I / / / / "yes" or " I  acknow e , but: essna niner three victor affirmative.For each RADICAL to be used with ALs-Systems a fully content-related expression unit in form of a pictogram has to be furnished.240 PBT~R KUMMELThis must be available in an adjacent archive.
Thus ambiguity bycarrier functions of different languages as well as homo-and syno-nymities can be eliminated.
Even for the conception of content relatedabstracts pictograms are possible, see (P. KiJMlVI~L, 1972a, p. 53 if).The meanings stay constant in time (P. KOM/CmL, 1967b, p. 42 if) and (P.Ki~lvil~L, 1968a, p. 52 f).
Pictograms of abstracts must be conceivedwith the fourth dimension "t ime" in them, realized by an arrow or adotted line for deplacements and movements.
For example in Chinaand Japan the character carrying the meaning " to gather" or " assem-ble " is still presently in use.
The sign-etymology reveals the followingdevelopment of morphological structures:1.

Numbers2, 3 and 4 represent abbreviations within several thousand years of use.4.
expresses the present da~ used form in China and Japan.For each RADICAL  the equivalent lemma or stem-word of at leastten National Language Systems has to be provided and implemented.Context sensitivity is limited down to a sequence law: Subject-Object-Predicate.
Example: /fatherlson/moneytransfer/.RADICALS written in vertical strokes and PARTICLES written inbrakes and vertical strokes are expressed by letter sequences withoutcapital etters.Example of rewriting conventional text into ALS-TEXT:Text to be rewritten: Newsweek, February 5, 1973, page 1, top of theweek, second column above: MACAO BOOMING OUTPOST, Page 23.:Portugals pint-size colony of Macao is a geopolitical anachronism per-ched precariously on the flank of China.

A case study within a molecular scope of human knowledge5.1.
Archival Hard Storage by the ALS-System.The whole human knowledge is to compare with an immenseCluster of RADICALS.
Each RADICAL represents one meaning.
Allof them are connected to each other following the graphic rules of adirected graph.
The number of meanings i  finite.
Each day new mean-ings are added, because inventions and scientific detections are made.Thus the cluster grows daily.
In order to obtain a 100% precise recordof the Cluster, each RADICAL should be evalt~ated after its eightcontent- or subcriteria.
These data of the criteria have to be imple-mented into a storage system.
For reasons of rationality primarilyfacts should be stored and expressions with untrue contents omitted.One molecular scope of the human treasure of knowledge is shownin Fig.

This RADICAL-CLUSTER in form of a directed graphexplains the single connections between the RADICALS.
If a Clusterin form of a cable-tree is given (P. KOMmEL, 1972a, p. 65), comparealso the loops in figures 4, 5 and 6 above, at each RADICAL theDISTRIBUTION- or RADICAL-VALUE is indicated by countingthe number of cables in the loop.Satzd-GlassS.

For instance in ALs-Text:/depend/(quest.)/sand-glass/function/.
This triggers a "second orderretrieve circuit" (Fig.

For the purpose of an answer all contentcriteria of the next upward loop or RADICAL  (in this case "/sand-glass/" are printed in ALS-Text,ask, what does a concrete meaning consist of, respectively whatsubfunctions an abstract meaning can be divided in?
This readsfor instance in ALs-Text: /consist/(quest)/sand-glass/structure/.
By"/consist/(quest)/" or "/divisible/(quest/" a third order retrievecircuit (Fig.
12) is triggered.
All content criteria of the neigh-bouring ramificated RADICALS from the " Query - RADICAL"are printed in succession according to the decimal fracture of theRADICAL-Numbers.For the procedttres so far three questions different in function werepossible:clear text: ALs-Text: implemented procedure:1. what is a ...?

Also the RADICALS of many concreta must be subdi-vided and ramificated into concreta s well as abstracta.5.3.
ALS-Automatic translation in natural anguage.In order to make use of the INTERLOGGING-VALUE of oneRADICAL ,  the following jump has been made from the RADICAL/sand-glass/: A person associates with Sand-Glass an uncle in London,who, in former times, helped to construct a working model of a Sand-Glass.
This uncle has a son studying in Paris who spends lots of moneyfrom his father.
The interlogging string ends at the RADICAL:/father/ (Fig.

/son/Paris/study/The procedure of Automatic Translation demands that each RADICALto be translated must be implemented into the RADICAL-CLUSTERas in Fig.
13.
All sub-criteria of a RADICAL have to be implementedby numbers too.
Corresponding to the Fact Retrieval above in 5.2.,each meaning or information unit implemented as a RADICAL intothe system is additionally related to a set of numbers.
These relatedidentification numbers each point to a repertoire of nouns belongingto national languages.
If, for instance, the system is furnished with tendifferent national anguages, every single RADICAL handled mustbe numbered with a national identification number (P. Kf3MM~L, 1972b,p.
486).
From 1 to 10 for example the following national anguagesystems might be put in sequence corresponding to their frequency ofoccurrence and importance by the user's per capita rate:1.
English 2.
Chinese 3, Indian4.
Russian 5.
Spanish 6.

DutchandEach meaning represented in the system by a RADICAL or loopwith its eight content criteria, is international in character.
Only theRADICALS can carry expressions of several national languages, notthe PARTICLES.
To obey this rule, words for question input can beAN ALGORITHM OF LIMITED SYNTAX 245of ten different national origins.
The system is programmed to markeach word with an additional national number, corresponding to thevery nationality.
Thus, ten different words link to one implementedmeaning of one RADICAL and are connected to it.The demand to translate into one of the ten above listed languagestriggers a corresponding number between 1 and 10.
ConsequentlyALs-Texts can be printed for answers in 10 different national languages.Because of internationally known syntactic patterns exclusively ap-plicated in the ALs-Sequence of heteronoms, the nationality of eachRADICAL in use does not affect the syntactical momentum involved.This leads to a simplification of the whole act of AUTOMATICTRANSLATION.
The entire procedure is solved by exclusivelytranslating the RADICAL-Expressions for the whole information inform of heteronoms.
If needed, the number of different national an-guages implemented into the system can be extended voluntarily aboveten.Automatic Translation of different national anguages according tothe ALs-System is only possible if all information units (meanings orRADICALS) concerned are implemented in the very patterns of theAutomatic Fact Retrieval under ~ 2 and after the ALS-R~ules.
All textsto be handled must follow stereotype syntactical features obeyingstrict eliminations of syntagms with low frequencies of occurrence asdescribed in the ALGORITHM OF LIMITED SYNTAX (ALS).tLEFEILENCESY.
