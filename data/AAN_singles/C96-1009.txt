Linguistshave long been interested in collocations and thedetinitions are nuiaerous and varied.
Some re-searchers include multi-o.leinent eOlnpOuIlds as (;x-amples of collocations; some admit only collo-cations (:onsisl;ing of pairs of words, while oth-ers admit only eollo(;ations consisting of a max-imum of tive or six words; some emphasize syn-l, aglnat, ic aspecl;s, others Selnmtl;ic aspects.
TheCOlllillOil poini;s regarding collocations appear tobe, as (Smadja, 1993) suggestsl: they are m'bi-l;rary (it is nol; clear why to "Bill through" meansto "fail"), th('y are domain-dependent ("interestrate", "stock market"),  t;hey are recurrenl; and co-hesive lo~xical clusters: the presence of one of the.collocates trongly Sltggesl;S /,tie rest of the cello-cat, ion ("Ulfited" could ilnply "States" or "King-dom").the classiiics collocations into i)redicative rela-tions, rigid noun phrases and phrasal telnplatcs.4 lIt is not the goal of this paper to provide yetanother definition of collocation.
We adopt as aworking definition the one by (Sinclair, 1991)Collocation is the occurrence of two ormore words within a short space of eachother in a text.Let us recall that collocations are domain-dependent.
Sublanguages have remarlmbly highincidences of collocation (Ananiadou and Mc-Naught, 1995).
(Frawley, 1988) neatly sums upthe nature of sublanguage, showing the key con-tribution of collocation:sublanguage is strongly lexically basedsublanguage t xts focus on contentlexical selection is syntactified in sublanguagescollocation plays a major role in sublanguagesublanguages demonstrate elaborate lexical co-hesion.The particular structures found in sublanguagetexts reflect very closely the structuring of a sub-language's associated conceptual domain.
It is theparticular syntactified combinations of words thatreveal this structure.
Since we work with sublan-guages we can use "small" corpora as opposed asif we were working with a general language corpus.In the Brown Corpus for example, which consistsof one million words, there are only 2 occurrencesof "reading material", 2 of "cups of coffee", 5 of"for good" and 7 of "as always", (Kjellmer, 1994).We extract uninterrupted and interrupted col-locations.
The interrupted are phrasal templatesonly and not predicatiw~ relations.
We focus onthe problem of the extraction of those collocationswe call nested collocations.
These collocations areat the same time substrings of other longer collo-cations.
To make this (:lear, consider the follow-ing strings: "New York Stock Exchange", "YorkStock", "New York" and "Stock Exchange".
As-suine that the first string, being a collocation, isextracted by some method able to extract colloca-tions of length two or more.
Are the other threeextracted as well?
"New York" and "Stock Ex-change" should be extracted, while "York Stock"should not.
Though the examples here are frontdomain-specific lexieal collocations, grammatieMones can be nested as well: "put down as", "putdown for", "put down to" and "put down".
(Smadja, 1993; Kits et al, 1994; Ikehara et al,1995), mention about substrings of collocations.Smadja's Xtract produces only the biggest possi-ble n-grams.
Ikehara et al, exclude the substringsof the retrieved collocations.A more precise approach to the problem is pro-vided by (Kits et al, 1994).
They extract a sub-string of a collocation if it, appears a significantamount of times by itself.
The following exam-ple illustrates the problem and their N)proach:consider the strings a="in spite" and b="in spiteof", with n(a) and n(b) their numbers of oceur-rencies in the corpus respectively.
It will alwaysbe n(a) > n(b), so whenever b is identified as acollocation, a is too.
Itowever, a should not beextracted as a collocation.
So, they modify themeasure of frequency of occurrence to becomeK(a) = (lal - 1)(n(a) - n(b)) (1)wherea is a word sequencela\[ is the length of an(a) is the number of occurrencies of a in the cur-pus.b is every word sequence that contains an(b) is the number of occurrencies of bAs a result they do not extract he sub-strings oflonger collocations unless they appear a signifi-cant amount of times by themselves in the corpus.The problem is not solved.
Table 2 gives the ex-tracted by Cost-Criteria n-grams containing "WallStreet".
The corpus consists of 40,000 words ofmarket reports.
Only those n-grants of frequency3 or more are considered.
It (:an be seen that"Wall Street" is not extracted as a collocation,though it has a frequency of occurrence of 38.Table 1: n-grams extracted by Cost-Criteria con-taining "Wall Street"c-ckKKA19202226193820Candidate CollocationsStaff" Reporter of The Wall Street JournalWall Street analystsReporter of The Wall Street JournalStaff Reporter of The Wall Streetof The Wall Street JournalThe Wall Street JournalWall Street JournalReporter of The Wall StreetWall Streetof The Wall StreetThe Wall Street423 Our  approach  - The  Algor i thmWe, call the extracted strings candidate colloca-tions rather than collocations, since what we ac-cet)t as collo(:ations depends oil tile application.It is the human judge that will give the tinal de-(:ision.
This is tile reason we consider tile methodas semi-automatic.Let us consider the string "New York Stock Ex-(:hange".
Within this string, that has already beenextra(:ted as a candidate collocation, there are twosubstrings that should/)e extracted, and one thatshouhl not.
The issue is how to distinguish whena substring of a (:andidate (:ollo(:ation is a candi-date collocation, and when it is not.
Kita et alassume that the substring is a candidate (:olloca-tion if it appears by itself (with a relatively highfrequency).
~lb this we add that:the sut)string aI)1)ears in more than one,(:an(li(lat(~' eollo(:ations, eVell if it, (h)es notappear by itself.
"Wall Street", for exalnple, appears 30 times in 6longer candidate colh)cations, and 8 times by it-self.
If we considered only the number of timesil; appears by itself, it would get a low value asa candidate collocation.
We have to consider thenumber of tilnes it apI)ears within hmger candi-date collocations.
A second fa(:tor is tit(!
numberof these hmger collocations.
The greater this num-t)er is, the better the string is distribute.d, an(l thegreater its value as a (:andi(late collocat;ion.
Wemake the above (:onditions more spe(:iti(: and givethe measure for a string being a candidate coll()-cation.
The measure is called C-value and the fa(>tors involved are the string's frequency of o(:eur-rence in the corpus, its fre(luen(:y of oe(:urrence inlonger candidate collocations, the immber of theselonger ('andidate (:ollocations and its length.
Re-gar(ling its length, we (:onsider hmger collocationsto t)e "more important" than shorter appearii~gwith the same fi'equency.
More specifically, if \]a\]is the length 2 of the string a, its C-value is analo-g()us to la I - 1.
The 1 is giv(m sin('e the shortestcollocations are of length 2, and we want them tobe "of ilnportan(;e" 2-1= 1.More specifically:1.
If a has the same hequen('y with a longercandidate (:ollocation that contains a, it isassigne(t C-value(a)=O i.e.
is not a colloca-tion.
it is straightforward that in this case aappears in one only hmger candidate colloca-tion.2We use tit(', same nol;ation with (Kita et al, 1.994).2.
If n(a) is the number of times a appears, anda is not a substring of an already extractedcandidate collocation, then a is assigned3.
If a appears as a substring in one or morecollocations (not with the same frequency),then it is assigned(I-I t(.))
(3)where t(a) is the total frequency of a in longercandidate collocations and c(a) the numberof ttmse candidate collocations.
This is themost complicate ase.Tit(; i lnportance of the.
I lu inber of occurrencesof a string in a longer string is il lustratedwith the de.nominator of the fraction in Equa-tion 3.
The bigger the nulnber of strings asubstring appears in, the smaller the fractionnum&~ o\] occu~ , the bigger the C-value of the string.The algorithm for the extraction of tile candi-elate collo(:ations follows:e.xtract he n-gramsdecide on the lowest frequency of collocationsrenlove tlle I>granls below this frequencylbr all n-grams a. of lllaxiHlulIl lengthcalculate their C-value= ('u - 1)n(a)tbr  all substrings brevise t(b)revise c(b)h)r all smaller n-grams a in descending orderif (total frequency of a)=(frequency of a ina longer string)a is NOT a collocationelseif a appears for the first timeelseC-v,,1,,.

(~z) Jfor all substrings brevise t(b)revise c(b)The above algorithln coinputes the C-value ofeach string in an incremental way.
That  is, foreach string a, we 1:(;(;i, a tuple ('n(a), t(a), c(a)} andwe revise tt,e t(a) and ,:(a) wflues.
For each n-gram b, every tin-le it is found ill a longer extracted43n-gram a, the vahles t(b) and c(b) are revised:t(1,) = t (b )  + -(:(b) = ,-(t,) + 1.Ill the, initial stage, n(a) is set to the frequency ofa appearing on its own, and t(a) and c(a) are setto 0.Table, 2: n-grmns e, xtraeted by C-wflue containing"Wall Street"F Candid~te Colloc;~tions __114 19 Staff ReI)orter of37.34 2636 2233 3831.34 2316 34 200 \]90 190 190 20 iTim \V~fll Street JournalWa.ll Street ,hmrnalThe \?M1 Street Journal\?all Strce, tThe Wall St, feet\Vail Street ~lm~lystsof The \?M1 Street, Journal12.ei)orter of The Wall StreetR,eporter of The Wall St, reel; JournalStaff II,eI)orter of \[File Wall S~reetof The YVa,ll StreetAn example:Let us calculate the C-value for the string "WallStreet".
Table 2 shows all the strings that appearmore that twice, and that contain "Wall Street".1.
The analysis tarts from the longest string, the7-gram "Staff l/.et)orter of The Wall Street Jour-rod".
Its C-value is (:ah:ulated l\[rom Equation 2.For each substrings eon|;ained in the 7-gram, tilenumber 11.9 (the l'requen(:y of the 7-gram) is kept,as its (till now) fl'equeney of occurrence in longer,strings.
For each of them, the fact that they havebeen already l'oun(t in a longer string is kept aswell.
Therefbre, t("Wall Street")=19 and c("\gallStreet")=l.2.
We continue with the two 6-grams.
Both ofthem, "l~,eporter of The Wall Street Journal" and:'Staff Reporter of The Wall Street" get; C-value=Osince they ~q)pear with the same l'requeney asthe 7-gram that contains the're.
Therefore, theydo not tbrm candidate collocations and they donot change the t("Wall Street") and the c("WallStreet") values.3.
F/)r the 5-grams, there is one appearing witha l'requency })igger than that of the 7-gram it:is (:()nta,incd in, "of The Wall Street Jourlml".This gets its C-value \[rom Equation 3. its sub-strings increase their frequcmey of occurrence ~ (assubstrings) by 20 19=1 (20 is the frequency ofthe 5-gram and 19 the fr0,queney it appearedin longer candidate collocal;ions), and the num-t)er of oeeurrence ~s su/)string by 1.
There-\[ore, t("Wall Street" ' )=19+l=20 and c("WallStreet")--1+1--2.
The other 5-gram is not a can-didate collocations (it gets C-value=O).4.
For tile 4-grams, the "The Wall Street Jour-nal" occurs in two longer n-grams and thereforegets its C-value from Equation 3.
Froin thisstring, t("Wall Street")=20+2=22 and c("WallStreet") -2+1=3.
The "of The Wall Street" isnot accepted as a eamtidate collocations ince it;apt)ears with the same fl'equeney as the "of TheWall Street Jom'nal'.5.
"Wall Street analysts" appears for thefirst time so it; gets its C-value from Equa-tion 2.
"Wall Street Journal" mnl "The WallStreet" appearing in longer extracted n-gramsget their values from Equation 3.
They maket("Wall Street" )=22+3+4+l=30 and c("WallSt, lee t" ) = 3+ \] + 1+ 1 =6.6.
Finally, we evaluate the C-value for "WallStreet" from Equation 3.
We find C-value("\?allStreet")=33.4 Exper iments -  Compar i sonThe eortms used for the experiments i  quite small(40,000 words) and consists of material ?otn th(~Wall Street Journal newswire.
For these exper-ilnents we used n-grams of maxilnuln length 10.Longer n-grains apt)ea.r once, only (because of thesize of the corpus).
The, maximum length of then-grams to be extracted is variallle attd dependson the size of the corpus and the application.From the extracted n-grams, those with a fle-quc'ncy of 3 or more were kept (other approachesget rid of n-grams of such low frequencies (Smadja,1993)).
These n-grams were lbrwarded into the,implementation of our algoril;hm as well as ourimplementation of the algorithm by (Kita et al,1:)94).The Cost-Criteria algorithm needs a secondthreshold (besides tile one for tile frequency of then-grams): for every n-gram a, K(a) is evaluated,and only those n-grams with this value greaterthan the' preset hreshold will take part to tile restof the algorithm.
We set this threshold to ;I againfor the, same reason as above (the gain we wouhlgel; for precision if we had set a higher thresholdwould be lost on recall).Table 3 shows the candidate c, ollocations withthe higher values, extra('Le(l with C-value.
A lot ofeandidate ,otlocations extracted may seem unim-portant.
This is because t}le algorithm extractstile word sequences that are fl'equent.
Which ofthese candidate collocations we should keep de-pends on the apt)lication.

They extend the measurefor three words in a different way than that de-fined by (Fano, 1961), and no mention is given tohow their formulas would be extended for word-sequences of length more that three.
They do notconsider nested collocations.
(Smadja, 1993), extracts uninterrupted as wellas interrupted collocations (predicative relations,rigid noun phrases and phrasal templates).
Thesystem performs very well under two conditions:the corpus must be large, and the collocations weare interested in extracting, must have high fre-quencies.
(Nagao and Mori, 1994), extract collocationsusing the tbllowing rule: longer collocations andfrequent collocations are more important.
An im-provement to this algorithm is that of (Ikehara etal., 1995).
They proposed an algorithm for theextraction of uninterrupted as well as interruptedcollocations from Japanese corpora.
The extrac-tion involves the following conditions: longer col-locations have priority, more frequent colloca-tions have priority, substrings are extracted onlyif tbund in other places by themselves.Finally, the Dictionary of English Collocations,(Kjellmer, 1994), includes n-grams appearing evenonly ()nee.
For each of them its exclusive fre-quency (number of occurrences the n-gram ap-peared by itself), its inclusive frequency (numberof times it appeared in total) and its relative fre-quency (the ratio of its ac.tual frequency to its ex-pected frequency), is given.6 Conc lus ions  and Future  WorkAs collocation identification (either in general lan-guage or in sublanguages) finds many applica-tions, the need to automate, as much as possible,that process increases.
Automation is helped bythe recent availability of large scale textual cor-pora.In this paper we dealt with the extraction of un-interrupted and interrupted collocations focusingon those we call nested collocations (those beingsubstrings of other collocations).
A inethod tbrtheir extraction was proposed.In fllture, we plan to extend our algorithm toinclude predicative relations.
We are going to in-corporate linguistic knowledge to improve the re-sults.
Finally, this algorithm will be applied forterm extraction.7 AcknowledgementsWe thank our anonymous reviewers for their com-ments.ReferencesAnaniadou, S.; McNaught, J.
