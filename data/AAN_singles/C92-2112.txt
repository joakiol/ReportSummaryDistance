ldc.lu.se FAX:46-(0)46 104210In t roduct ion  and abst rac tWeather forecasts were early notedto be a domain where automatictranslation was possible (Kittredge,1973).
Everybody in the field knowsthat there is a computer in Montrealtranslat ing forecasts routinely be-tween French and English (METEO).The weather domain has proven tobe a fruitful domain for furtherresearch as witnessed e.g.
by thesystem for generat ing  mar ineforecasts presented by Kittredge etal (1986), by the work by Goldberget al(1988), by the system gene-rating publ ic  weather reports inBulgarian reported on by Mitkov(1991) and the system translatingF inn ish  mar ine  fo recasts  intoSwedish by Bl~tberg (1988).The Swedish Weathra systemto be presented in this paperexplores the language and semanticsof weather forecasts further and itaims at deep comprehens ion offorecasts.
Beside grammatical  re-presentations, Weathra uses repre-sentations of the meteorological rawfacts and secondary facts, e.g.
thefact that it will probably rain at aplace where there is a low pressurearea.
It uses a representat ion ofmeteoro log ica l  objects with theirproperties as frames in a data baseand graphic representation with tilestandard meteorological icons on amap, e.g.
icons for sun, cloudy, rain,snow,  thunders torm,  wester lywinds, L(ow) and H(igh) pressure,temperatures, e.g.
10-15.
Weathraalso features a dynamic discourserepresentat ion  inc lud ing  thediscourse objects which may bereferred to by the words andanaphora in the text (cf Karttunen,1976, Johnson & Kay, 1990).
Thediscourse objects are regarded asinstances of the (proto)types or(concepts), which are also availableas frames in a database.The formal grammar, morpho-logy and lexicon of Weathra arebased on exper ience  from themachine translation system Swetra(Sigurd & Gawronska, 1988), whichis also written in Prolog (LPAMacProlog).
The Weathra systemcan understand weather forecasts ina fair ly deep sense, depict  itscomprehension in a map, answerquestions about the main contentsand consequences, translate Englishforecasts into Swedish ones and viceversa, and generate various forecasttexts in English or Swedish.AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOUI" 1992 7 4 9 PROC.

AUG. 23-28, 1992The language of forecastsEven a quick glance at the weatherforecasts in newspapers hows thatthey are written in a special formatbeside using a restricted vocabulary(the METEO system uses some 1000words, and so does Weathra).
Thereare in fact two basic styles in theforecasts: the telegraphic styleillustrated by Sun; Cloudy; Windy;Cool; Morning fog; Thunderstorms inthe coastal areas; High 20, Low 15;Westerly winds; Snow over Alps;Visibility moderate; Cloudy, littlerain at first, brighter later and anormal descriptive style illustratedby A low pressure area is movingtowards Scandinavia.
It is expectedto reach Norway in the afternoon.There is, in fact, also an informalpersonalized style which may beillustrated by the following quotesfrom a British newspaper (theEuropean):Players in the Rugby League testmatch between Great Britain andAustralia on Saturday may needlonger studs and safe hands totackle the tricky conditions atLondon 's  Wembley  stadium.Sunseekers looking to top up theirtan need look no further thansouthern Spain.The Weathra system is primarilydesigned to treat the telegraphicand the descriptive styles.The grammar of forecastsWeathra includes two grammarsmotivated by the distinctionbetween te legraphic weatherphrases and full sentences.Interestingly enough the gramma-tical categories of the two kinds ofexpressions differ.
The telegraphicphrase grammar can work with asuperordinate category callednominal which includes both nounsand adjectives.
The noun phrasesused in telegraphic grammar maybe somewhat different.
They may,for instance, lack articles asevidenced by some of the examplesmentioned above.
The adjectives ofthe nominal category have a specialmarker (-t) in Swedish, cf Englishsun in coastal areas: sunny in coastalareas (Swedish: Sol i kustomrddet:Soligt i kustomrddet.The telegraphic meteorologicalphrases lack finite verbs, but thereis often a parallel full sentence witha future verb will be (available inthe full sentence module).l.a.

OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992The fol lowing is the basic ruleshowing how Engl ish  weatherutterances (ewutt) can be generatedas phrases (ewph) or full sentences(ewsent).ewutt(T,F,S,\[\]) :- ewph(T,F,S,\[\]).ewutt(T,F,S,\[\]) :- ewsent(T,F,S,\[\]).The basic rule for phrases is:ewph(A,\[event(N),t ime(fut) ,advl(A),advl(B),co(C)\]) -->eadv(A),enom(N),eadv(B),eco(C).This rule generates e.g.
In themorning mild; Rain in the evening;In Scotland gale in the afternoon;Rain and snow, i.e.
nominal phraseswith adverbial determiners beforeand/or after a nominal which canthen be an adjective or a noun,single or coordinated.
As can beseen the rules render a listrepresentat ion called funct iona levent representation, where theevent is the first term, then actors,t ime and adverbials.
There isnormal ly  no more than twoadverbial phrases before or afterthe nominal.
The last term co(C)takes care of cases of coordinatedphrases or sentences.
The first slotis used to indicate which constituentis in focus (first), information whichis useful in the text generationprocess.The further division of thesuperord inate  category nomina l(enom)  is i l lustrated by thefollowing rules for English:enom(M) --> enp(Agr,M).enom(M) --> cap(M).enp(Agr,n om(H,Adj,Attr)) -->eap(Adj),en(Agr,H),epattr(Agr,Attr).Note that noun phrases have tocarry agreement information (Agr)into the post attributive expression(epatt r )  as it might be a relativeclause where tile inflection of theverb depends on the features of thehead of tile np, as in: light windswhich turn west/ light wind whichlurns west.The following is one of the DCGrules generating and analyzing fullsentences :ewsent(N,I event(V),actor(N),t ime(T),advl(A 1),co(C)\]) --> enp(Agr,N),evi(Agr,m(V,T)),eadv(A 1 ),esco(C).It can for instance generate thesentence: A low pressure areaapproaches Scandinavia.
Anotherpattern is used in order to generatesentences uch as The low pressurearea will bring rain in Sweden, etc.There are about a dozen differentsyntactic structures to be found inthe forecasts.The lexicon has the sameformat as Swetra.

It is said to dosomething which is an instance of'movement ' ,  etc.
The secondsentence may refer to differentobjects introduced in the firstsentence, even to objects denoted byverbs or sentences (It moves fast).If we are to elaborate thissentence we would say T h emovement (of the gale towardsScandinavia) happens fast, but onemay also use a hyperonym as in Theevent happens fast and possibly Theaccident happens (or develops) fast.We may say that the same object isbeing referred to in the sentence: Itis a disaster, but in this case onemay assume the existence of a typeof object which has been called" inc lus ive referent"  by BonnyWebber .Note the distinction between atemporary object created in order tothink or say something and apermanent object such as 'gale'.Even a concept can be referred to,as i l lust rated by the secondsuccessive alternative (It translatesas "storm" in Swedish), where itmust refer to the object 02, which isa concept, not the object 01.We may also note that a wordused may be referred to, asil lustrated by It should better bespelled "forward", where it certainlyrefers to the word fo rwards .
If itwere to refer to the concept onewould not use the word spel led butrather denoted.This survey is intended toclarify that it is generally necessaryto keep track of the following typesof objects and representations:1) Meteorological objectsThese include both objects proper,such as low pressure areas andother air masses, and episodes(states, events,  and processes)describing phenomena such as rain,change of temperature, as well aslocations and time intervals.2) Discourse objectsDiscourse objects can be describedby meteorological objects, but theyalso have linguistic expressions.
Notall meteorological objects whoseexistence is implied by a forecastdescribe discourse objects.3) Grammatical representationsGrammatical  representat ions referto expressions signifying discourseobjectsThe main levels of representation iWeathra are:Level of meteorological objectsair mass: gale doing:move speed:fast direction: ScandinaviaLevel of discourse objectsOl :ga le  O2:move O3:Scandinav iaO4:(=O1) O5:move O6:fastAcrEs DE COLING-92, Nhbrr~s, 23-28 ao~r 1992 7 5 3 I)ROC.

It moves fast.The permanent  concepts  whichconstitute frames with informationis only background objects alludedto by the words (cf Nirenburg &Defrise, 1991).
The concept (frame)gale thus includes the informationthat a 'gale' has speed and that thisspeed is between 20 and 30 metersper second, a direction (which allspeeds have),  often leads toaccidents at sea and along thecoasts, etc.
To an English-speakingperson the concept is known to bedenoted by the word ga le ,  to aSwede by s torm,  but that is notessential information in the concept'gale',  The concept 'move' is toinc lude the in format ion thatmovement impl ies being at oneplace first and another later, acertain speed and direction.
To thosewho are familiar with it the concept'Scand inav ia '  inc ludes  theinformation that this is a place andan area, which covers Norway,Sweden, Denmark etc.
Scandinavia isa proper name and not a genericnoun and something cannot be saidto be an instance of the concept'Scandinavia'.
Concepts are stored asframes using the tool FLEX which isavailable with LPA MacProlog.Understanding and generatingweather forecastsThe program allows a (telegraphicor full) sentence to be parsed by thegrammar and lexicon applying someimpl icat ional  morphological  proce-dures.
This analysis renders a kindof funct ional  representat ion  asshown above.
This representation isparsed by mapp ing  procedureswhich look for depictable objectsand places.
Words such as sun ,sunny, result in a sun in the properplace in a map, rain results in theproper  symbol ,  wester ly  windsresults in an arrow with the properdirection.
Note that several wordsmay result in the same symbol onthe map.
Sunny, sun and fair  will allbe represented by the icon "sun".The functional representat ionis also scanned by the conceptf inder which looks for conceptsabout which it has information.
Thusthe frame 'gale' is used as theprototype of the instance O1 and'move' is used as the prototype of02.
The meteorological finder looksfor data for its general frames.The system can be used forgeneration by placing a certain iconon the map and ca l l ing  forgeneration.
