After a p r e l i a i n a r y  parseu s i n g  an augmented transition network, t h e  case routines attemptto find the appropr ia te  verb meaning.
These rout ines  search forparts of t h e  s y n t a c t i c  structure which  best s a t i s f y  therequirements  of t h e  verb case frames and under b a c k - u p  are ableto weaken gradually the c o n d i t i o n s  far success.

The basic difference is revea ledin  illn no re's aescription of five or six cases, whereas o u rsystem uses, at present, twenty-four cases.Perhaps t h e  tar.
ncasetl is inappropriate  here, but there isanough s imi lar i ty  w i th ,  and motivat ion from, Pillmore's v o r kthat we decided t o  use the term.
The most complex part  of thel e x i c o n  is t h e  verb w i t h  its associated case frame: actually ane n v i r o n a e n t  of obligatory and opt ional  cases associated with t h everb.
One b a s i c  p r o b l e a  of sentence analysis is to choose amonga l ternate  verb meanings for  an appropriate aandidate, Thisselection process i s  governed, in p a t t ,  by at tempt ing  to s a t i s f ythe constraints imposed by the case frames associated with eachverb  meaning.
B u t  prior to a c t i v a t i n g  the case-driven p a r t  oft h e  system, a p r e l i m i n a r y  stage of analysis must be i n i t i a t e d .T h i s  i s  an almost purely syntactic p h a s e  carried out by a rathers i a p l e  augmented t r a n s i t i o n  network ( A  , (Roods[ 11,12 1).
heAT1 has proven to be very u s e f u l  in natural l a n g u a g e  process ingmainly because of the ease of r e p r e s e n t i n g  complicated andi n t e r r e l a t e d  s y n t a c t i c  structures,For our p u r p o s e s ,  t h e  ATH is used to produce  a very fastpre l iminary  parse of the i n p u t  s e n t e n c e  w h i c h  i n d i c a t e s  grosss t ruc tura l  re la tions, U s i n g  t h i s  parse, the c a s e - d r i v e ncomponent seeks to select the appropriate v e r b  meaning.
It i simportaat to note t h a t  if the Gase procedures fail on the f i r s tpass ,  c o n d i t i o n @  for success are progress ive ly  weakened u n t i lthe most s u i t a b l e  meaning is chosen.
Although not a feature oft h e  p r e s e n t  system, it would be p o s s i b l e  to re-enter the ATNphase in order t o  produce another parse if the case p h a s e  wereunab le  to complete its task in a s a t i s f a c t o r y  manner.Ye would l i k e  to stress those a s p e c t s  of the systea u h i c haake it flexible and u s e f u l  for  a w i d e  range of l a n g u a g eprocess ing  applications.
It is straightforward to i nco rpo ra t ed i f f e r e n t  k i n d s  of knowledge necessary f o r  adequate processing.P u z  e x a ~ p l e ,  t h e  current s y s t e ~  has a procedure f o r  r e s o l v i n g  af a i r  range of anaphoric references for pronouns .
If a d d i t i o n a lprocedures are d e v e l o p e d ,  they can a l s o  be incorporated  i n t o  t h es y s t e m ,  and will exert their inff iuence by a o d i f y i a g  the searchprocedures  for c a n d i d a t e s  which satisfy the reqa ireaents  of thecase frane for verbs .
another important feature is t h e  f a c i l i t yw i t h i n  the dic t ionary  entries of nouns for p r o v i d i n g  i n f  oreationabout relevant properties, such  as superset and subset .

Cages and VerbsThe question a?
how many cases we need to d e s c r i b e  E n g l i s his a content ious  one, Pillaase[ 3 1  is vague on t h e  issue, whereasCelce-lurcial2 ] claims that five cases w i l l  do.
The p u r p o s e  o ft h i s  work is to capture as much of the meaning of a sentence asi s  p o s s i b l e ,  and to make i t  e x p l i c i t  in a formal structure.Case, then, is an e x p l a n a t i o n  of the semantic f u n c t i o n  of asentence part; theref ore a fairly large nonber of cases havebeen used, one for each of these "semantic f unctionsw.
Ye arenot adamant about our set of cases.

BESIDEf l a g s  the cases: LOCATIOI  and DESCRIPTIVE.
A 1 1  of t h e  cases butDESCRIPTXVE are  cases of t h e  verb.
DESCRIPTIVE i s  a s p e c i a l  casev h i c h  is used for preposition phrases which modi fy  noons.When the list of cases associated with a p r e p o s i t i o n  isretrieved, there is a q u e s t i o n  as to u h i c h  case to try first.For this there is a foregrounding rout ine ,  w i t h  several  cr i t er iafor f oregrounding  :First of a l l ,  i n  the d i c t i o n a r y  d e f i n i t i o n  of t h e  verb, t h euser may s p e c i f y  that a certa in  prepos i t ion  trigger a part icularcase program.
S i n c e  there i s  n o  such  s p e c i f i c a t i o n  for "to play"in the current dictionary, nothing hap pens here, S e c o n d l y ,  onthe property  list of each verb  is k e p t  a record of uhichprepos i t i ons  flagged v h i c h  cases in the previous sentehces.
Thecases associated with the p r e p o s i t i o n  i n  q u e s t i o n  (if there areany) are f o r e g t o u n d e d ,  so that they u i l l  be tried f irst  (themst recent case f irs t ,  etc.)
P i n a l l y ,  if DESCRIPTIVE is one ofthe cases in the list of cases for this preposition, and if anoun phrase  or a prepos i t i ona l  phrase immediately'  precedes theJfphrase in q u e s t i o n ,  and if the noun in that noun phrase orprepos i t i ona l  phrase i s  n o t  a proper noun, then DESCRIPTIVE isp u t  at the front of the list, and is t h u s  tried first.This s e e m i n g l y  obscar~ rule for foregrounding theDESCRIPTIVE case is just a h e u r i s t i c .
If the t e s t s  assoc iatedw i t h  each case are good enough, it makes nb difference to thef i n a l  outcome iE the foregrounding is done or not.
In someinstances ,  houever, if the DESCRIPTIVE case is not  tried first ,it w i l l  never be t r i e d .
In our e x a ~ p l e ,  for instance, it is t h eman who is bes ide  the vindow ( D E S C R I P T I V E  case) ; he d i d  n o t  playt h e  piano beside the window (LOCAT'ION case).
But it is perfectlp'f e a s i b l e  for him to have p l a y e d  it beside the, window (if we knownothing about the l o c a t i o n  of the piaao.)
Therefore either oft h e  cases will succeed.
It is only the position of thep r e p o s i t i o n a l  phrase t h a t  i n d i c a t e s  which case is correct.Continuing with our exaaple: the DESCRIPTIVE case isforegrounded.
and so t h e  d e s c r i p t i v e  case f u n c t i o n ,  DESC, isi n v o k e d  wi th  the - phrase  " b e s i d e  t h e  windova as its argument.S i n c e  the d e s c r i p t i v e  case almost a l w a y s  i n v o l v e s  apreposit ional  phrase modi fy ing  the noun phrase or p r e p o s i t i o n a lphrase i m ~ e d i a t e l y  before it, DBSC first c h e c k s  to see i f"beside the viado@.
