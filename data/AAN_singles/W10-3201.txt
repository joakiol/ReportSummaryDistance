Since verb mean-ings highly depend on their argumentswe propose a verb thesaurus on the ba-sis of possible shared meanings withpredicate-argument structure.
Motiva-tions of this work are to (1) construct apractical lexicon for dealing with alter-nations, paraphrases and entailment re-lations between predicates, and (2) pro-vide a basic database for statistical learn-ing system as well as a theoretical lex-icon study such as Generative Lexiconand Lexical Conceptual Structure.
Oneof the characteristics of our descriptionis that we assume several granularitiesof semantic classes to characterize verbmeanings.
The thesaurus form allows usto provide several granularities of sharedmeanings; thus, this gives us a further re-vision for applying more detailed analy-ses of verb meanings.1 IntroductionIn natural language processing, to deal withsimilarities/differences between verbs is essen-tial not only for paraphrase but also textual en-tailment and QA system which are expectedto extract more valuable facts from massivelylarge texts such as the Web.
For example, inthe QA system, assuming that the body textsays ?He lent her a bicycle?, the answer of thequestion ?He gave her a bicycle??
should be?No?, however the answer of ?She rented thebicycle??
should be ?Yes?.
Thus construct-ing database of verb similarities/differences en-ables us to deal with detailed paraphrase/non-paraphrase relations in NLP.From the view of the current language re-source, how the shared/different meanings of?He lent her a bicycle?
and ?He gave her a bi-cycle?
can be described?
The shared mean-ing of lend and give in the above sentences isthat they are categorized to Giving Verbs, asin Levin?s English Verb Classes and Alterna-tions (EVCA) (Levin, 1993), while the differentmeaning will be that lend does not imply own-ership of the theme, i.e., a bicycle.
One of theproblematic issues with describing shared mean-ing among verbs is that semantic classes such asGiving Verbs should be dependent on the gran-ularity of meanings we assumed.
For example,the meaning of lend and give in the above sen-tences is not categorized into the same Framein FrameNet (Baker et al, 1998).
The reasonfor this different categorization can be consid-ered to be that the granularity of the semanticclass of Giving Verbs is larger than that of theGiving Frame in FrameNet1.
From the view ofnatural language processing, especially dealingthe with propositional meaning of verbs, all ofthe above classes, i.e., the wider class of Giv-ing Verbs containing lend and give as well asthe narrower class of Giving Frame containinggive and donate, are needed.
Therefore, in thiswork, in order to describe verb meanings withseveral granularities of semantic classes, a the-saurus form is adopted for our verb dictionary.Based on the background, this paper presentsa thesaurus of predicate-argument structure forverbs on the basis of a lexical decompo-sitional framework such as Lexical Concep-tual Structure (Jackendoff, 1990); thus our1We agree with the concept of Frame and FrameEle-ments in FrameNet but what we propose in this paper is thenecessity for granularities of Frames and FrameElements.1proposed thesaurus can deal with argumentstructure level alternations such as causative,transitive/intransitive, stative.
Besides, tak-ing a thesaurus form enables us to deal withshared/differenciate meaning of verbs with con-sistency, e.g., a verb class node of ?lend?
and?rent?
can be described in the detailed layer ofthe node ?give?.We constructed this thesaurus on Japaneseverbs and the current status of the verb thesaurusis this: we have analyzed 7,473 verb meanings(4,425 verbs) and organized the semantic classesin a ve-layer thesaurus with 71 semantic rolestypes.
Below, we describe background issues,basic design issues, what kind of problems re-main, limitations and perspectives of applica-tions.2 Existing Lexical Resources andDrawbacks2.1 Lexical Resources in EnglishFrom the view of previous lexical databasesIn English, several well-considered lexicaldatabases are available, e.g., EVCA, Dorr?sLCS (Dorr, 1997), FrameNet, WordNet (Fell-baum, 1998), VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005)and PropBank (Palmer et al, 2005).
Be-sides there is the research project (Pustejovskyand Meyers, 2005) to nd general descriptionalframework of predicate argument structure bymerging several lexical databases such as Prop-Bank, NomBank, TimeBank and PennDiscouseTreebank.Our approach corresponds partly to eachlexical database, (i.e., FrameNet?s Frame andFrameElements correspond to our verb classand semantic role labels, and the way to orga-nize verb similarity classes with thesaurus cor-responds with WordNet?s synset), but is notexactly the same; namely, there is no lex-ical database describing several granularitiesof semantic classes between verbs with argu-ments.
Of course, since the above English lex-ical databases have links with each other, it ispossible to produce a verb dictionary with sev-eral granularities of semantic classes with argu-ments.
However, the basic categories of classify-ing verbs would be little different due to the dif-ferent background theory of each English lexicaldatabase; it must be not easy to add another levelof semantic granularity with keeping consistencyfor all the lexical databases; thus, thesaurus formis needed to be a core form for describing verbmeanings2.2.2 Lexical Resources in JapaneseIn previous studies, several Japanese lexiconswere published: IPAL (IPA, 1986) focuses onmorpho-syntactic classes but IPAL is small3.EDR (Jap, 1995) consists of a large-scale lex-icon and corpus (See Section 3.4).
EDR isa well-considered and wide coverage dictio-nary focusing on translation between Japaneseand English, but EDR?s semantic classes werenot designed with linguistically-motivated lex-ical relations between verbs, e.g., alternations,causative, transitive, and detransitive relationsbetween verbs.
We believe these relations mustbe key for dealing with paraphrase in NLP.Recently Japanese FrameNet (Ohara et al,2006) and Japanese WordNet (Bond et al, 2008)are proposed.
Japanese FrameNet currentlypublished only less than 100 verbs4.
BesidesJapanese WordNet contains 87000 words and46000 synsets, however, there are three majordifculty of dealing with paraphrase relationsbetween verbs: (1) there is no argument informa-tion; (2) existing many similar synsets force us tosolve ne disambiguation between verbs whenwe map a verb in a sentence to WordNet; (3) thebasic verbs of Japanese (i.e., highly ambiguousverbs) are wrongly assigned to unrelated synsetsbecause they are constructed by translation fromEnglish to Japanese.2As Kipper (Kipper-Schuler, 2005) showed in theirexamples mapping between VerbNet and WordNet verbsenses, most of the mappings are many-to-many relations;this indicates that some two verbs grouped in a same se-mantic type in VerbNet can be categorized into differentsynsets in WordNet.
Since WordNet does not have argu-ment structure nor syntactic information, we cannot pur-chase what is the different features for between the synsets.3It contains 861 verbs and 136 adjectives.4We are supplying our database to Japanese FrameNetproject.23 Thesaurus of Predicate-ArgumentStructureThe proposed thesaurus of predicate-argumentstructure can deal with several levels of verbclasses on the basis of granularity of dened verbmeaning.
In the thesaurus we incorporate LCS-based semantic description for each verb classthat can provide several argument structure suchas construction grammar (Goldberg, 1995).
Thismust be high advantage to describe the differentfactors from the view of not only syntactic func-tions but also internal semantic relations.
Thusthis characteristics of the proposed thesaurus canbe powerful framework for calculating similar-ity and difference between verb senses.
In thefollowing sections we explain the total design ofthesaurus and the details.3.1 Design of ThesaurusThe proposed thesaurus consists of hierarchy ofverb classes we assumed.
A verb class, whichis a conceptual class, has verbs with a sharedmeaning.
A parent verb class includes conceptsof subordinate verb class; thus a subordinateverb class is a concretization of the parent verbclass.
A verb class has a semantic descriptionthat is a kind of semantic skeleton inspired fromlexical conceptual structure (Jackendoff, 1990;Kageyama, 1996; Dorr, 1997).
Thus a seman-tic description in a verb class describes core se-mantic relations between arguments and shadowarguments of a shared meaning of the verb class.Since verb can be polysemous, each verb sense isdesignated with example sentences.
Verb senseswith a shared meaning are assigned to a verbclass.
Every example sentence is analyzed intotheir arguments and semantic role types; andthen their arguments are linked to variables in se-mantic description of verb class.
This indicatesthat one semantic description in a verb class canprovide several argument structure on the basisof syntactic structure.
This architecture is relatedto construction grammar.Here we explain this structure using verbssuch as rent, lend, give, hire, borrow, lease.
Weassume that each verb sense we focus on here isdesignated by example sentences, e.g., ?Mothergives a book to her child?, ?Kazuko rents a bicy-cle from her friend?, and ?Taro lend a car to hisfriend?.
As Figure 1 shows that all of the aboveverb senses are involved in the verb classMovingof One?s Possession 5.
The semantic description,which expresses core meaning of the verb classMoving of One?s Possession is([Agent] CAUSE) ?BECOME [Theme] BE AT [Goal].Where the brackets [] denote variables that canbe lled with arguments in example sentences.Likewise parentheses () denote occasional factor.?Agent?
and ?Theme?
are semantic role labelsthat can be annotated to all example sentences.Figure 1 shows that the children of the verbclass Moving of One?s Possession are the twoverb classesMoving of One?s Possession/Rentingand Moving of One?s Possession/Lending.
In theRenting class, rent, hire and borrow are there,while in the Lending class, lend and lease exist.Both of the semantic descriptions in the childrenverb classes are more detailed ones than the par-ent?s description.			 !" #$%&'%"%()!'% (*+,! !" #$%&'-% .$/ !()!&'%"%()!'% (*+,! !" #$%&'-% .$/()!*!&'%"%()!'% (*+,!)00,0Figure 1: Example of verb classes and their se-mantic descriptions in parent-children.A semantic description in the Renting class,i.e.,([Agent] CAUSE)5The name of a verb class consists of hierarchy ofthesaurus; and Figure 1 shows abbreviated verb classname.
Full length of the verb class name is Change ofState/Change of Position (Physical)/Moving of One?s Pos-session.3(BY MEANS OF [Agent] renting [Theme])BECOME [Theme] BE AT [Agent],describes semantic relations between ?Agent?and ?Theme?.
Since semantic role labels are an-notated to all of the example sentences, the vari-ables in the semantic description can be linkedto practical arguments in example sentences viasemantic role labels (See Figure 2).1	2 	" %'% / 				'%"%		'%  				! 			"	# 			Figure 2: Linking between semantic descriptionand example sentences.3.2 Construction of Verb Class HierarchyTo organize hierarchical semantic verb class, wetake a top down and a bottom up approaches.
Asfor a bottom up approach, we use verb sensesdened by a dictionary as the most ne-grainedmeaning; and then we group verbs that can beconsidered to share some meaning.
As for a dic-tionary, we use the Lexeed database (Fujita etal., 2006), which consists of more than 20,000verbs with explanations of word sense and ex-ample sentences.As a top down approach, we take three se-mantic classes: State, Change of State, and Ac-tivity as top level semantic classes of the the-saurus according to Vendler?s aspectual analy-sis (Vendler, 1967) (See Figure 4).
This is be-cause the above three classes can be useful fordealing with the propositional, especially, resul-tative aspect of verbs.
For example ?He threw aball?
can be an Activity and have no special re-sult; but ?He broke the door?
can be a Change ofState and then we can imagine a result, i.e., bro-ken door.
When other verb senses can expressthe same results, e.g., ?He destroyed the door,?we would like to regard them as having the samemeaning.We dene verb classes in intermediate hierar-chy by grouping verb sense on the basis of aspec-tual category (i.e., action, state, change of state),argument type (i.e., physical, mental, informa-tion), and more detailed aspects depending onaspectual category.
For example, walk the coun-try, travel all over Europe and get up the stairscan be considered to be in the Move on Pathclass.Verb class is essential for dealing with verbmeanings as synsets in WordNet.
Even if we hadgiven an incorrect class name, the thesaurus willwork well if the whole hierarchy keeps is-a rela-tion, namely, the hierarchy does not contain anymultiple inheritance.The most ne-grained verb class before in-dividual verb sense is a little wider than alter-nations.
Currently, for the ne-grained verbclass, we are organizing what kind of differenti-ated classes can be assumed (e.g., manner, back-ground, presupposition, and etc.
).3.3 Semantic Role LabelsThe aim of describing arguments of a target verbsense is (1) to link the same role arguments ina related verb sense and (2) to provide disam-biguated information for mapping a surface ex-pression to a verb sense.
The Lexeed databaseprovides a representative sentence for each wordsense.
The sentence is simple, without adjunc-tive elements such as unessential time, locationor method.
Thus, a sentence is broken down intosubject and object, and semantic role labels areannotated to them (Figure 3).ex.
:      nihon-ga shigen-wo yunyuu-surutrans.
:  Japan       resouces import(NOM)     (ACC)AS:       Agent       ThemeFigure 3: An example of semantic role label.Of course, only one representative sentencewould miss some essential arguments; also, we4CAUSEACT ON BECOMEBE AT [Ken]x [book]y[shelf]z [book]yKen-ga hon-wo tana-ni oku(Ken puts a book on a shelf.

That is to say, we regard a verb class as aconcept of event and suppose it to be a xed ar-gument frame for each verb class.
The argumentframe is described as compositional relations.The principal function of the semantic role la-bel name is to link arguments in a verb class.One exception is the Agent label.
This can be amarker discriminating transitive and intransitiveverbs.
Since the semantic class of the thesaurusfocuses on Change of State, transitive alternationcases such as ?The president expands the busi-ness?
and ?
The business expands?
can be cate-gorized into the same verb class.
Then, these twoexamples are differentiated by the Agent label.3.4 Compositional Semantic DescriptionAs described in Section 3.1, we incorporate com-positional semantic structure to each verb classto describe syntactically motivated lexical se-mantic relations and entailment meanings thatwill expand the thesaurus.
The benet of com-positional style is to link entailed meanings bymeans of compositional manner.
As an exampleof entailment, Figure 5 shows that a verb classMove to Goal entails Theme to be Goal, and thiscorresponds to a verb class Exist.6We are currently constructing an SRL annotated cor-pus.activitychange ofstatestatemove togoalchange of position(physical)hierarchical verb classexistchange of position (animates)test([A] CAUSE) BECOME[T] BE AT [G][T] BE AT [G]partially correspondcompositionaldescriptionFigure 5: Compositional semantic description.In this verb thesaurus, being different fromprevious LCS studies, we try to ensure the com-positional semantic description as much as pos-sible by means of linking each sub-event struc-ture to both a semantic class and example sen-tences.
Therefore, we believe that our verb the-saurus can provide a basic example data base forLCS study.3.5 Intrinsic Evaluation on CoverageWe did manual evaluation that how the pro-posed verb thesaurus covers verb meanings innews articles.
The results on Japanese new cor-pus show that the coverage of verbs is 84.32%(1825/2195) in 1000 sentences randomly sam-pled from Japanese news articles7.
Besideswe take 200 sentences and check whether theverb meanings in the sentences can correspondto verb meaning in our thesaurus.
The resultshows that our thesaurus meaning covers 99.5%(199 verb meanings/200 verb meanings) of 2007Mainichi news article in 2003.5verbs8.4 Discussions4.1 Comparison with Existing ResourcesTable 1 and Table 2 show a comparison of sta-tistical characteristics with existing resources.
Inthe tables, WN and Exp denote the number ofword meanings and example sentences, respec-tively.
Also, SRL denotes the number corre-sponding to semantic role label.Looking at number of concepts, our Thesaurushas 709 types of concepts (verb classes) whichis similar to FrameNet and more than VerbNet.This seems to be natural because FrameNet isalso language resource constructed on argumentstructure.
Thanks to our thesaurus format, if weneed more ne grained concepts, we can expandour thesaurus by adding concepts as new nodesat the lowest layer in the hierarchy.
While at thenumber of SRL, FrameNet has much more typesthan our thesaurus, and in the other resourcesVerbNet and EDR the number of SRL is less thanour thesaurus.
This comes from the different de-sign issue of semantic role labels.
In FrameNetthey try to differentiate argument types on the ba-sis of the assumed concept, i.e., Frame.
In con-trast with FrameNet we try to merge the sametype of meaning in arguments.
VerbNet andEDR also dened abstracted SRL; The differ-ence between their resources and our thesaurusis that our SRLs are dened taking into accountwhat kind of roles in the core concept i.e., verbclass; while SRLs in VerbNet and EDR are notdependent on verb?s class.Table 2 shows that our thesaurus does not havelarge number in registered words and examplescomparing to EDR and JWordNet.
As we statedin Section 3.5, the coverage of our verb class tonewspaper articles are high, but we try to add ex-amples by constructing annotated Japanese cor-pus of SRL and verb class.8This evaluation is done by one person.
Of coursewe need to check this by several persons and take inter-annotator agreement.Table 1: Comparing to English resourcesFrameNet WordNet VerbNetConcepts 825 N/A 237(Frame) (Synset) (class)(Ver 1.3) (Ver 3.0) (Ver 2.2)2007 2006 2006Words 6100 155287 3819WM N/A 117659 5257Exp 13500 48349 N/ASRL 746 N/A 23POS V,N,A,Ad V,N,A,Ad VLang E,O E,O ETable 2: Comparing to Japanese resourcesEDR JWordNet Our ThesaurusConcepts 430000 N/A 709(class)(Ver 3.0) (Ver 0.92)2003 2009 2008Words 410000 92241 4425WM 270000 56741 7473Exp 200000 48276 7473SRL 28 N/A 71POS all V,N,A,Ad VLang EJ E,J J4.2 Limitations of Developed ThesaurusOne of the difculties of annotating the seman-tic class of word sense is that a word sense canbe considered as several semantic classes.
Theproposed verb thesaurus can deal with multiplesemantic classes for a verb sense by adding theminto several nodes in the thesaurus.
However,this does not seem to be the correct approach.For example, what kind of Change of State se-mantic class can be considered in the followingsentence?a.
He took on a passenger.Assuming that passenger is Theme,Move to goalcould be possible when we regard the vehicle9 asGoal.
In another semantic class, Change State ofContainer could be possible when we regard thevehicle as a container.
Currently, all of the verbsenses are linked to only one semantic class thatcan be considered as the most related semanticclass.9Vehicle does not appear in the surface expression butvehicle can exist.
We currently describe the shadow argu-ment in the compositional description, but it would be hardto prove the existence of a shadow argument.6From the user side, i.e., dealing with thepropositional meaning of the sentence (a.
), vari-ous meanings should be estimated.
Consider thefollowing sentence:b.
Thus, we were packed.As the semantic class of the sentence (a.
)Change State of Container could better explainwhy they are packed in the sentence (b.
)The other related issue is how we describe thescope, e.g.,c.
He is hospitalized.If we take the meaning as a simple manner,Moveto Goal can be a semantic class.
This can becorrect from the view of annotation, but we canguess he cannot work or he will have a toughtime as following events.
FrameNet seems to beable to deal with this by means of a special typeof linking between Frames.Consequently, we think the above issues of se-mantic class should depend on the applicationside?s demands.
Since we do not know all of therequirements of NLP applications currently, thenit must be sufcient to provide an expandable de-scriptional framework of linguistically motivatedlexical semantics.4.3 Remaining and Conceivable Ways ofExtensionOne of the aims of the proposed dictionary is toidentify the sentences that have the same mean-ings among different expressions.
One of thechallenging paraphrase relations is that the sen-tences expressed from the different view points.Given the buying and selling in Figure 6, a hu-man can understand that both sentences denotealmost the same event from different points ofview.
This indicates that the sentences made byhumans usually contain the point of view of thespeaker.
This is similar to a camera, and we needto normalize the expressions as to their originalmeaning.We consider that NLP application researchersneed to relate these expressions.
Logically, if weknow ?buy?
and ?sell?
have shared meanings ofgiving and taking things, we can describe theireventcamera=personA C BD``I bought C from A?
?A C BDneed to normalizeby estimationexpression``I sold C to B?
?difference ofstanding pointis essentiallyexpressedgivepresentFigure 6: Requirement of normalization to dealwith different expressions from the differentviews.relations with ?or?
in logical form.
Therefore,nding and describing these verb relations willbe essential for dealing with propositional mean-ings of a sentence.For further view of application, event match-ing to nd a similar situation in Web documentsis supposed to be a practical and useful appli-cation.
Assuming that a user is confronted withthe fact that wireless LAN in the user?s PC doesnot work, and the user wants to search for doc-uments that provide a solution, the problem isthat expressions of situations must be differentfrom the views of individual writers, e.g., ?wire-less LAN did not work?
or ?wireless LAN wasdisconnected?.
How can we nd the same mean-ing in these expressions, and how can we ex-tract the answers by nding the same situationfrom FAQ documents?
To solve this, a lexicaldatabase describing verb relations between ?gowrong?
and ?disconnect?
must be the base forestimating how the expressions can be similar.Therefore, constructing a lexicon can be worth-while for developing NLP applications.5 ConclusionIn this paper, we presented a framework of a verbdictionary in order to describe shared meaning aswell as to differentiate meaning between verbsfrom the viewpoint of relating eventual expres-sions of NLP.
One of the characteristics is thatwe describe verb relations on the basis of several7semantic granularities using a thesaurus formwith argument structure.
Semantic granularityis the basis for how we categorize (or recognizewhich semantic class relates to a verb meaning).Also, we ensure functions and limitations of se-mantic classes and argument structure from theviewpoint of dealing with paraphrases.
That is,required semantic classes will be highly depen-dent on applications; thus, the framework of theverb-sense dictionary should have expandability.The proposed verb thesaurus can take several se-mantic granularities; therefore, we hope the verbthesaurus will be applicable to NLP?s task10.In future work, we will continue to organizedifferentiated semantic classes between verbsand develop a system to identify the same eventdescriptions.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank NTT CommunicationResearch Laboratory for allowing us to use theLexeed database, and Professor Koyama formany useful comments.ReferencesBaker, Collin F., Charles J.
