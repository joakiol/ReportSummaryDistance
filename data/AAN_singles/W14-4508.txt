In particular, we identify and trace Byron?s influence onMoore?s writings to query whether Moore imitated Byron, as many reviewers of the time sug-gested.
We use a Distributional Semantic Model (DSM) to analyze if there is a shared vocabularyof Romantic Orientalism, or if it is possible to characterize a literary genre in terms of vocabu-lary, rather than in terms of the particular plots, characters and themes.
We discuss the resultsthat DSM models are able to provide for an abstract overview of the influence of Lord Byron?swork on Thomas Moore.1 IntroductionLiterary criticism has often marshalled the serendipitous discovery in the service of constructing an ar-gument or a critical judgment.
Such serendipity can take material or cognitive form, and provide theraw materials for analysis and conjecture.
In literary criticism, arguments are often based upon evidencegleaned from close reading of a text in support of a hypothesis, but quantitative methods have shown howliterary texts can yield evidence that is not immediately discernible to the human eye for a similar inter-pretive purposes.
In literary studies, computers have assisted in the collection of such data with varyingdegrees of complexity and sophistication for about half a century.
How can we use the information fromsuch computing processes for creating new knowledge, or, in literary-critical terms, for articulating themeaning in a text?
To what degree can literary criticism and computing enrich one another?
Is algorith-mic criticism derived from algorithmic manipulation of text (Ramsay, 2011) possible?Inspired by general questions such as these, this paper discusses a particular project that uses Distribu-tional Semantics to trace influence and imitation between two particular poets writing in the genre ofRomantic Orientalism.
Our intuition is that if text analysis can yield evidence of shared vocabulary totrace influence between poets, we can build a network of different authors with their degree of influences.This can help a reader in finding a similar literature and in discovering implicit information.In the period from 1813 to 1817, friends and fellow-poets Lord Byron and Thomas Moore wrote a seriesof long poems which are now seen as representative of Romantic Orientalism (a subset of Romanticliterature recognisable by its Oriental and Middle-Eastern themes and settings).
Throughout this period,an unusual pattern of coincidence is evident in the writings of the two poets, with correspondence be-tween the poets describing similar plots, settings, and characters names in their respective works.
Thepublication of Byron?s quartet of Oriental tales in 1813 and 1814 (The Giaour, The Bride of Abydos, TheCorsair, Lara) anticipated much of the substance of Moore?s work, and delayed the publication of hisown suite of four Oriental poems, Lalla Rookh, until 1817.
On the publication of the latter, many re-viewers accused Moore of imitating Byron?s work, correctly fulfilling Moore?s own prediction of 1813,This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

(Moore, 1964).
Subsequent critics havegenerally acknowledged Byron as a direct influence on Moore, but the basis of these acknowledgementsis usually subjective critical interpretation of plot, character, and poetic form in the published texts (see,in particular, (Vail, 2001), (Sultana, 1989), (Gregory, 2008)).
More general accounts of Byron?s andMoore?s literary association can be found in (Hamilton, 1948), (Jordan, 1948), (Tessier, 2014).The purpose of this project is to investigate further the possible causes for the unusual pattern of co-incidence in the writings of these two poets during this time.
A Computational Linguistics approach toByron?s and Moore?s Orientalism was identified as a potentially productive way of studying coincidence,influence, and imitation between their writings and how they related to the genre of Romantic Oriental-ism.
Fresh empirical insight into this topic is desirable because of the difficulty of thinking about andarticulating these issues in a way that is not speculative or nebulous.
Such methodologies have not beenapplied to these texts, and offer the possibility of yielding fresh perspectives on questions about the texts,and the genre of Romantic Orientalism: is it defined by a limited vocabulary which inevitably leads tosimilarities and coincidences between its practitioners?
Does writing within a specific genre impose top-ical or semantic constraint upon the author?The motivations for the project emerge from a conviction that Computational Linguistics techniques mayreveal evidence of shared vocabulary or formal textual characteristics in the works of Byron and Mooreduring the period 1813-17.
The questions that the project seeks to answer include: can we identify andtrace Byron?s influence on Moore?s writings?
Did Moore imitate Byron, as many reviewers of the timesuggested?
Is there a shared vocabulary of Romantic Orientalism?
Is it possible to characterise a literarygenre in these terms, rather than in terms of plot, character, theme, etc.?
The basis for such enquiriesmust go beyond a subjective comparison of the poems: the method that has characterised literary-criticalapproaches to these texts to date.2 Distributional semanticsHow related are love and emotion?
Reasoning about semantic relatedness of natural language text isnot a very difficult task for a human because of sufficient background knowledge and other related in-formation to understand the semantics of natural language text.
However, for computers, it is still anopen issue to provide significant background knowledge to understand the complex structure of naturallanguage.
One plausible way to provide such background knowledge is taking the usage of given text inlarge contextual space into account.Semantic relatedness of two given terms (text fragments, phrases or words) can be obtained by calculat-ing the correlation between two high dimensional vectors of a Distributional Semantic Model (DSM),which is based on the assumption that semantic meaning of a text can be inferred from its usage in context(Harris, 1954), i.e.
its distribution in text.
DSM builds this semantic representation through a statisticalanalysis over the large contextual information in which a term occurs (see for details (Landauer, 1998),(Blei, 2003)).
One recent popular model to calculate this semantic relatedness by using the distributionalsemantics is Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) proposed by (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007), whichattempts to represent the semantics of the given term by a high dimensional vector in explicit conceptspace such as Wikipedia concepts.
Every explicit concept represents a dimension of the ESA vector, andassociativity weight of a given term with the explicit concept reflects the vector dimension weight.
Forinstance, for a given term t, ESA builds a vector v, where v =?Ni=0ai?
ciand ciis ithconcept from theexplicit concept space, and aiis the associativity weight of term t with the concept ci.
Here, N representsthe total number of concepts.
The semantic relatedness score is calculated by taking cosine between thecorresponding high dimensional vectors.3 ApproachSection 1 described our aim to investigate whether textual analysis techniques can yield evidence aboutByron?s influence on Moore?s writings by analyzing the four long poems (published in 1813-14) byLord Byron and a collection of four long poems (published in 1817) by Thomas Moore.
To analyze thisinfluence, we calculate semantic relatedness scores between Byron?s poems and Moore?s poems.
We split44these poems in line-groups1and obtain 227 line-groups from Byron?s poems and 246 line-groups fromMoore?s poems.
We calculate ESA scores of every line-group of Byron?s poems with every line-groupof Moore?s poems.
All the line-group pairs can be sorted according to their relatedness scores, whichcan provide highly related line-group pairs.
After getting these highly related pairs, we can manuallyanalyze them, and if manual analysis confirms the high relatedness of the pairs provided by ESA, then itmay indicate some degree of influence or imitation between the poets.
Also, these results will concludethat text analysis techniques can reduce the human effort in analyzing the influence between work bydifferent authors.4 Evaluation4.1 ExperimentWe built two ESA models; one by using Wikipedia and the other by using a corpus of poetry primarilyfrom the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries2.
In the first model, we take every Wikipedia article as adimension of the ESA vector, and TF-IDF weight of a given text with article content is considered as theassociativity strength with the corresponding dimension.
We use modified ESA (Aggarwal, 2012) whichbuilds the ESA vector by taking all words of a given text together rather than taking them individually.Wikipedia may not have a good coverage of the vocabulary of poems in Romantic Orientalism, whichled us to try another ESA model that utilizes a Poetic Corpus.
This corpus consists of 892 long poemsand some of the poems contain more than 7K lines.
Therefore, we split each poem with their line-groupsand obtain 22K different line-groups.
Similar to Wikipedia-based ESA, we take every line-group as adimension of the ESA vector, and TF-IDF weight of the given text with line-group is considered as as-sociativity strength with the corresponding dimension.We use both ESA models: Wikipedia-based ESA and Poetic Corpus-based ESA to calculate the semanticrelatedness scores of every line-group of Byron?s poems with every line-group of Moore?s poems.
Boththe results obtained by these two models are analyzed manually to check if Poetic Corpus-based ESAoutperforms Wikipedia-based ESA as Poetic Corpus has better vocabulary coverage for Romantic Ori-entalism poems.
We described in section 3 that we obtain 227 line-groups from Byron?s poems and 246line-groups from Moore?s poems that means 56K line-group pairs.
Manual analysis of 56K line-grouppairs will take a very long time, therefore, we analyze only a small subset of the 56K pairs.
To select thesample, we categorize the line-group pairs in three different categories: Highly-Related, May-be-Relatedand Not-Related.
In the ranked list of line-group pairs, the top 1K are considered Highly-Related, thepairs ranked between 25K to 26K are considered May-be-Related, and the bottom 1K are taken as Not-Related.
We randomly selected 5 line-group pairs from each category and manually analyzed the resultsobtained from ESA.
Hence, we analyzed 15 pairs obtained according to Wikipedia-based ESA and 15pairs according to PoeticCorpus-based ESA.4.2 Results and DiscussionManual (close-reading) analysis of 15 line-group pairs from the Wikipedia-based ESA took place first.At first glance, the pairs identified as Highly-Related were indeed quite closely related, particularly interms of their narrative content.
While some individual line-groups appeared in more than one pair-ing identified by the model, the pair exhibited a frequently occurring narrative scenario where a femalecharacter addressed her male lover before the departure or death of one of the parties.
The model alsosucceeded in identifying this scenario in poems by both Byron and Moore.
The scenes are unsurprisinglyunited by the presence of strong emotional language and imagery on the theme of love.
However, therecognition of a leavetaking (whether in death or departure) in the scenes is also noteworthy, as is the factthat the identified line-groups are comprised of direct quotations from characters (as opposed to poeticnarrative).1Line-groups in poetry are similar to paragraphs in prose.
On the printed page, a line of white space separates one line groupfrom the next.
Like paragraphs, they vary in length, and are often semantically, syntactically, or thematically self-contained.2The poems in this corpus come from Women Writers Project (1560-1845), Eighteenth-Century Collections Online (1701-1800), and poetic corpora shared by Ted Underwood (1701-1899)45Subjected to manual analysis, pairs of line-groups in the May-be-Related and Not-Related categoriesexhibit varying degrees of relatedness.
Most are lacking the immediate recognition of narrative similar-ity evident in the Highly-Related pairs, with some pairs containing vastly different narrative scenarios.Many of the consistencies from the Highly-Related category are also absent: some pairs vary greatly inlength, and some contain a mix of narrative and quotation.
One example from the manually-analysedexamples proved to be a potential anomaly: a pair determined by the model to be Not-Related (i.e.
in thebottom 1K of pairs in terms of relatedness) might easily be considered related in that both line-groupsare florid poetic descriptions of a pastoral landscape.The results of the Poetic Corpus-based ESA model were similar, if a little more refined.
Interestingly,the line-group pairs in the Highly-Related category were largely similar to those resulting from theWikipedia-based ESA.
They were comprised of direct quotation (rather than narrative), and featureda character speaking to their lover in strong emotional language.
In some cases (though not consistently)greater linguistic similarities between the pairings were more evident than in the results of the Wikipedia-based ESA.
This was an anticipated consequence of using the Poetic Corpus-based ESA, where the modelwould be more likely to recognise the more unconventional features of nineteenth-century poetic dictionthan the Wikipedia-based ESA.From a literary-critical perspective, however, identification of the Highly-Related pairs by a computer isno great advance on the capabilities of human scholarship.
A traditional scholar can just as easily recog-nise the similarities in the scenes identified by both the Wikipedia- and Poetic Corpus-based ESAs in thecourse of reading the eight poems by Byron and Moore.
Their narrative similarity is the most prominentcharacteristic that contributes to their relatedness.
This identification can be made by the lone scholarbecause the dataset is relatively small in this project, and the time needed to read and analyse it is notprohibitive.
The potential value of this kind of automated semantic-relatedness identification is increasedwhen it is applied in a more exploratory fashion to larger datasets, and to poetic corpora whose scalesare beyond the reasonable comprehension of the individual scholar.
In this scenario, a potential appli-cation of the process would involve identifying and mapping the patterns and networks of relatedness inlarge-scale poetic corpora.
For the present purposes of this project?studying imitation and influence inthe texts of Byron and Moore?semantic relatedness measurements have been of limited value on theirown, but have offered promise in other areas.
The first aspect of their success has been in identifyingsentiment analysis as a potential next step in drilling down into the texts to further reveal the essence oftheir similarity.
The second is revealing a wider application of semantic relatedness in examining broaderpatterns of similarity within the history of poetry.5 Conclusions and Future WorkWe developed a method to identify influence and imitation in Romantic Orientalism poetry.
We built twoExplicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) models by using Wikipedia and a Poetic Corpus.
The results fromthe analysis conducted with the Poetic Corpus-based ESA were a slight improvement on those resultingfrom the Wikipedia-based ESA.
This was as anticipated, and results might be improved even further witha refined Poetic Corpus comprised of works from a more concentrated time period, which are more likelyto share linguistic similarities with the Byron and Moore poems.The performance of ESA model depends on several parameters (Aggarwal, 2014) that are includedin the model, therefore, future work will include an investigation of ESA model in literature research.Also, we are planning to use an improved version of the ESA (Polajnar, 2013) model which reducethe orthogonality problem in the model.
The value of ESA to the particular task of tracing imitationand influence in the Romantic Orientalist poetry of Byron and Moore has been limited thus far, but ithas provided evidence of linguistic similarities in the expression of emotion.
The next step for furtherinvestigation of imitation and influence between the two poets will involve the use of sentiment analysis.ESA was successful in identifying line groups that were closely related in terms of their narrative contentand in their use of similarly emotional language.
For such a small dataset, this does not represent asignificant improvement on close reading, as similar results could have been obtained in this mannerquite quickly.
But the automated identification of semantic relatedness demonstrated in this project has46potentially valuable applications for exploring broader literary corpora.
For instance, a semantic mappingof transnational and transhistorical poetic relatedness is a possible future venue for our research.AcknowledgmentsThis work has been funded in part by a research grant from Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under GrantNumber SFI/12/RC/2289 (INSIGHT) and by the EU FP7 program in the context of the project LIDER(610782).ReferencesHarris, Zellig, Distributional structure, 1954.
