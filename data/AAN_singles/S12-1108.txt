Box 2704, Beijing 100190, China{mengfandong,xionghao,liuqun}@ict.ac.cnAbstractIn this paper, we present our system descrip-tion in task of Cross-lingual Textual Entail-ment.
The goal of this task is to detectentailment relations between two sentenceswritten in different languages.
To accomplishthis goal, we first translate sentences writtenin foreign languages into English.
Then, weuse EDITS1, an open source package, to rec-ognize entailment relations.
Since EDITS onlydraws monodirectional relations while the taskrequires bidirectional prediction, thus we ex-change the hypothesis and test to detect en-tailment in another direction.
Experimentalresults show that our method achieves promis-ing results but not perfect results compared toother participants.1 IntroductionIn Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment task (CLTE)of 2012, the organizers hold a task for Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment.
The Cross-LingualTextual Entailment task addresses textual entail-ment (TE) recognition under a new dimension(cross-linguality), and within a new challengingapplication scenario (content synchronization)Readers can refer to M. Negri et al 2012.s., formore detailed introduction.
1Textual entailment, on the other hand, recog-nize, generate, or extract pairs of natural languageexpressions, and infer that if one element is true,whether the other element is also true.
Severalmethods are proposed by previous researchers.There have been some workshops on textual en-tailment in recent years.
The recognizing textualentailment challenges (Bar-Haim et al 2006;Giampiccolo, Magnini, Dagan, & Dolan, 2007;Giampiccolo, Dang, Magnini, Dagan, & Dolan,2008), currently in the 7th year, provide additionalsignificant thrust.
Consequently, there are a largenumber of published articles, proposed methods,and resources related to textual entailment.
A spe-cial issue on textual entailment was also recentlypublished, and its editorial provides a brief over-view of textual entailment methods (Dagan, Dolan,Magnini, & Roth, 2009).Textual entailment recognizers judge whetheror not two given language expressions constitute acorrect textual entailment pair.
Different methodsmay operate at different levels of representation ofthe input expressions.
For example, they may treatthe input expressions simply as surface strings,they may operate on syntactic or semantic repre-sentations of the input expressions, or on represen-tations combining information from different1http://edits.fbk.eu/715levels.
Logic-based approach is to map the lan-guage expressions to logical meaning representa-tions, and then rely on logical entailment checks,possibly by invoking theorem provers (Rinaldi etal., 2003; Bos & Markert, 2005; Tatu & Moldovan,2005, 2007).
An alternative to use logical meaningrepresentations is to start by mapping each word ofthe input language expressions to a vector thatshows how strongly the word co-occurs with par-ticular other words in corpora (Lin, 1998b), possi-bly also taking into account syntactic information,for example requiring that the co-occurring wordsparticipate in particular syntactic dependencies(Pad?o & Lapata, 2007).
Several textual entailmentrecognizing methods operate directly on the inputsurface strings.
For example, they compute thestring edit distance (Levenshtein, 1966) of the twoinput strings, the number of their common words,or combinations of several string similaritymeasures (Malakasiotis & Androutsopoulos, 2007).Dependency grammar parsers (Melcuk, 1987; Ku-bler, McDonald, & Nivre, 2009) are popular intextual entailment research.
However, cross-lingualtextual entailment brings some problems on pastalgorithms.
On the other hand, many methods can?tbe applied to it directly.In this paper, we propose a translation basedmethod for cross-lingual textual entailment, whichhas been described in Mehdad et al 2010.
First, wetranslate one part of the text, which termed as ?t1?and written in one language, into English, whichtermed as ?t2?.
Then, we use EDITS, an opensource package, to recognize entailment relationsbetween two parts.
Large-scale experiments areconducted on four language pairs, French-English,Spanish-English, Italian-English and German-English.
Although our method achieves promisingresults reported by organizers, it is still far fromperfect compared to other participants.The remainder of this paper is organized asfollows.
We describe our system framework insection 2.
We report experimental results in section3 and draw our conclusions in the last section.2 System DescriptionFigure 1 illustrates the overall framework of oursystem, where a machine translation model is em-ployed to translate foreign language into English,since original EDITS could only deal with the textin the same language pairs.In the following of this section, we will de-scribe the translation module and configuration ofEDITS in details.Figure 1:  The framework of our system.2.1 Machine TranslationRecently, machine translation has attracted inten-sive attention and has been well studied in naturallanguage community.
Effective models, such asPhrase-Based model (Koehn et al, 2003), Hierar-chical Phrase-Based model (HPB) (Chiang, 2005),and Syntax-Based (Liu et al, 2006) model havebeen proposed to improve the translation quality.However, since current translation models requireparallel corpus to extract translation rules, whileparallel corpus on some language pairs such asItalian-English and Spanish-English are hard toobtain, therefore, we could use Google TranslationToolkit (GTT) to generate translation.Specifically, WMT 2 released some bilingualcorpus for training, thus we use some portion totrain a French-English translation engine usinghierarchical phrase-based model.
We also exploitsystem combination technique (A Rosti et al, 2007)to improve translation quality via blending thetranslation of our models and GTT?s.
It is worthnoting that GTT only gives 1-best translation, thuswe duplicate 50 times to generate 50-best for sys-tem combination.2  http://www.statmt.org/wmt12/7162.2 Textual EntailmentMany methods have been proposed to recognizetextual entailment relations between two expres-sions written in the same language.
Since edit dis-tance algorithms are effective on this task, wechoose this method.
And we use popular toolkit,EDITS, to accomplish the textual entailment task.EDITS is an open source software, which isused for recognizing entailment relations betweentwo parts of text, termed as ?T?
and ?H?.
The sys-tem is based on the edit distance algorithms, andcomputes the ?T?-?H?
distance as the cost of theedit operations (i.e.
insertion, deletion and substitu-tion) that are necessary to transform ?T?
into ?H?.EDITS requires that three modules are defined: anedit distance algorithm, a cost scheme for the threeedit operations, and a set of rules expressing eitherentailment or contradiction.
Each module can beeasily configured by the user as well as the systemparameters.
EDITS can work at different levels ofcomplexity, depending on the linguistic analysiscarried on over ?T?
and ?H?.
Both linguistic pro-cessors and semantic resources that are available tothe user can be integrated within EDITS, resultingin a flexible, modular and extensible approach totextual entailment.Figure 2: An Example of two expressionsEDITS can recognize.Figure 2 shows an example of two expressionsthat EDITS can recognize.
EDITS will give an an-swer that whether expression ?H?
is true given thatexpression ?T?
is true.
The result is a Boolean val-ue.
If ?H?
is true given ?T?
is true, then the resultis ?YES?, otherwise ?NO?.EDITS implements a distance-based frame-work which assumes that the probability of an en-tailment relation between a given ?T?-?H?
pair isinversely proportional to the distance between ?T?and ?H?
(i.e.
the higher the distance, the lower isthe probability of entailment).
Within this frame-work the system implements and harmonizes dif-ferent approaches to distance computation,providing both edit distance algorithms, and simi-larity algorithms.
Each algorithm returns a normal-ized distance score (a number between 0 and 1).
Ata training stage, distance scores calculated overannotated ?T?-?H?
pairs are used to estimate athreshold that best separates positive from negativeexamples.
The threshold, which is stored in aModel, is used at a test stage to assign an entail-ment judgment and a confidence score to each testpair.Figure 3: Our configured file for trainingFigure 3 shows our configuration file for train-ing models, we choose ?distance?
algorithm inEDITS, and ?default_matcher?, and ?ignore_case?
,and some other default but effective configuredparameters.Figure 4: The overall training and decodingprocedure in our system.Figure 4 shows our training and decodingprocedure.
As EDITS can only recognize textualentailment from one part to the other, we manuallychange the tag ?H?
with ?T?, and generate the re-sults again, and then compute two parts?
entailmentrelations.
For example, if ?T?-?H?
is ?YES?, and?H?-?T?
is ?NO?, then the entailment result be-tween them is ?forward?
; if ?T?-?H?
is ?NO?, and?H?-?T?
is ?YES?, then the entailment result be-tween them is ?backward?
; if both  ?T?-?H?
and?H?-?T?
are ?YES?, the result is ?bidirectional?
;717otherwise ?no_entailment?.3 Experiments and ResultsSince organizers of SemEval 2012 task 8 supply apiece of data for training, we thus exploit it to op-timize parameters for EDITS.
Table 1 shows the F-measure score of training set analyzed by EDITS,where ?FE?
represents French-English, ?SE?
rep-resents Spanish-English, ?IE?
represents Italian-English and ?GE?
represents Italian-English.Judgment  FE SE IE GEforwardbackwardno_entailmentbidirectionalOverall0.3390.6110.5330.5150.5160.3730.5740.5350.5020.5060.4400.4930.4940.5060.4880.3270.5520.4940.4950.482Table 1:  Results on training set.From Table 1, we can see that the perfor-mance of ?forward?
prediction is lower than others.One explanation is that the ?T?
is translated fromforeign language, which is error unavoidable.
Thussome rules used for checking ?T?, such as stop-word list will be disabled.
Then it is possible toinduce a ?NO?
relation between ?T?
and ?H?
thatresults in lower recall of ?forward?.Since for French-English, we build a systemcombination for improving the quality of transla-tion.
Table 2 shows the results of BLEU score oftranslation quality, and F-score of entailmentjudgment.System  BLEU4 F-scoreHPBGTTCOMB28.7430.0830.570.4960.5080.516Table 2:  Performance of different translationmodel, where COMB represents system com-bination.From table 2, we find that the translation qual-ity slightly affect the correctness of entailmentjudgment.
However, the difference of performancein entailment judgment is smaller than that intranslation quality.
We explain that the translationmodels exploit phrase-based rules to direct thetranslation, and the translation errors mainly comefrom the disorder between each phrases.
While adistance based entailment model generally consid-ers the similarity of phrases between test and hy-pothesis, thus the disorder of phrases influences thejudgment slightly.Using the given training data for tuning pa-rameters, table 3 to table 6 shows the detailed ex-perimental results on testing data, where Prepresents precision and R indicates recall, andboth of them are calculated by given evaluationscript.French -- EnglishJudgment P R F-measureforwardbackwardno_entailmentbidirectionalOverallBest System0.7500.5170.3850.4440.1920.4960.6560.4800.3060.5060.4850.4620.4560.570Table 3: Test results on French-EnglishSpanish -- EnglishJudgment  P R F-measureforwardbackwardno_entailmentbidirectionalOverallBest System0.7500.4400.3950.4360.2400.4720.5600.5200.3640.4560.4640.4740.4480.632Table 4: Test results on Spanish-EnglishItalian ?

have better performancethan those trained on RTE1 and RTE2, except ?bi-directional?
judgment type.
In Table 9, all resultsdecoding by models trained on ?CLTE?
are thebest.
And in Table 10, only a few results decodingby models trained on ?RTE1?
and ?RTE2?
havehigher score.
The reason may be that, the test cor-pora are bilingual, there are some errors in the ma-chine translation procedure when translate one partof the test from its language into the other.
Whentraining on these bilingual text and decoding thesebilingual text, these two procedure have error con-sistency.
Some errors may be counteracted.
If wetrain on RTE, a standard monolingual text, anddecode a bilingual text, more errors may exist be-tween the two procedures.
So we believe that, ifwe use translation based strategy (machine transla-tion and monolingual textual entailment) to gener-ate cross-lingual textual entailment, we should usetranslation based strategy to train models, ratherthan use standard monolingual texts.4 ConclusionIn this paper, we demonstrate our system frame-work for this year?s cross-lingual textual entail-ment task.
We propose a translation based modelto address cross-lingual entailment.
We first trans-late all foreign languages into English, and thenemploy EDITS to induce entailment relations.
Ex-periments show that our method achieves promis-ing results but not perfect results compared to otherparticipants.AcknowledgmentsThe authors were supported by National ScienceFoundation of China, Contracts 90920004, andHigh-Technology R&D Program (863) Project No2011AA01A207 and 2012BAH39B03.
