Remarks on the Notation of PPT}~e notion of Preposit ional  Phrase has afJ.
rm and long standing tradit ion in the An~/:J o-.laxor, l inguistic framework , includingr~P\[~C~.
The classical Continental tradit ion, onthe other h~ind, does not use this term for\]~nf<uage descr ipt ion in majority of frame-~.
;or\]:s developed and treats preposit ions pre-4omJnantl,v as markers of nouns.
In this pa-y, er, I will adhere to this approach.The most important reason for doingthis is the fact ~hat , on the assumption ofexistence of PP, it is impossible to generates~ich sentences as (1) in the GPSG context.-free framework.
(I) I went there with John and with Paul,who met each other before.The point is, that in (I), on the assumption~f the existence of PP, we find a PP-coordi--r~tion, result ing in a PP, rather than an NPone.
Consequently,  the relative clause mustbe sister of this PP rather than of an NP.lint this is (at \].east in my opinion) hardlya~ acceptable solution, both intuit ively andformally.
Even an attempt to cope with thisoroblom by means of r ightward "Across-the-Poard" extraposit ion would not make thingsbetter, since such a solution would presumephrases as "John who met each other" to becorrect English NP's.
I do not wish to pursuethis further here, the problem is more tho-roughly described in (01iva,88) from bothintuitive and formal viewpoints.
What I real-ly wanted to do was to motivate the decisionof avoiding the term PP in this paper (and,possibly,  the necessity of omitting it fromthe CPSG framewor\]e altogether),  which will bereflected in the notat ion of rules.
Thus ,assuming otherwise the notation famil iar from(Oazdar,Klein,Pul lum and Sag,85) , the catego-ry PP {\[PFOR~ z\]} wi l l  he reoasted  as~Pf \ [PREP z \]} , wh ich  should road as "NP mar -ked with preposit ion ~ " As a special valueof the feature PREP, the value "nil" ought tobe introduced, with the meaning that thereis no preposit ion marking the NP in question(i.e., the category NP~\[PREP nil\]} in the new494notation is exactly equivalent to the simpleNP in the notation of (Gazdar ,~(lein ,Pullumand Sag ,85)).2?
The Szn__tactic Funct ion  FeatureIn this paper, I shall try to showsome of the problems connected with omittingthe tradit ional notion of (syntactic) func-t ion in GPSG, and their possible solutions?The payoffs of the notion mentioned canbe seen e.g.
on the c lassi f icat ion of adver-~bials: each adverbial modif ier,  whether ex-pressed by an NP {PREP} , by an adverb, by asubordinated clause or otherwise, has itsmore specific meaning ("function") in thesentence.
With specific lexlcal units,  e.g.with the verb "put", this is so obvious thata "semantic" c lassi f icat ion was proposed evenin some of the syntactical approaches, cfo(Bresnan and Grimshaw,78),  and later trans-ferred into GPSG without change, as can beseen on the presence of the feature L0C andrelated lexical rule introducing "put" (2).
(2) VP----~ H\[6\] ,NP,PP\[+LOC}Further, two more such features, viz.
MANNERand TEMP, were, unfortunately again with nosystematic motivat ion,  proposed as "possiblesolution" for some problems of coordinationin (Sag,Gazdar,Wasow and Weisler,85).
Thesefeatures LOC,MANNER,TEZP are, of course, no-thing else than function markers on adverbialmodif iers (of location, of manner, of time)?Now the time has come to introdfice thesemodif iers more systematical ly; but I add twoarguments in favour of such systemizationbefore.
First, the rule (2), expl icit ly sti-pulating the complement as PP (or, a lterna-t ively, as NP {PREP\] ) , does not provide thetheory with the power to generate any of (3).(3)a.
I have put my spectacles somewhere,but now I cannot recall where it was.b.
She put it where I wanted it.The second argument comes again from coordi--nation; neither under the tradit ional "cate-gorial harmony" nor under the newly proposedtheory of (Sag,Gazdar,Wasow and Weisler,85),the contrast in (4) could be explained.
(4) a.
She was kil led by her husbandand by his mistress.bo She was killed by a hammerand by an axe.c.
*She was kil led by her husbandand by a hammer.Under the "functional" approach, however, wefind in (4)a the coordinat ion of a_~nts("deep subjects"), in (4)b the coordinationof instruments; but in (4)c an attempt tocoordinate a ~  and instrument is involved,wh ich  makes  th is  s t r ing  ungrammat ica l .Thus, it seems to be advantageous to addone more item to the feature system of GPSG,namely the feature of function (let it becalled FUNC, hence) of the phrase in the sen-tence.
Its values will mark the adverbialmodifiers of place (lee), direction (dir),manner (mod), instrument (instr), purpose(purp), ss well as other functions of phra-ses, such as subject (subj), direct object(dobJ), indirect object (iobj), predicative(prd), resu\]t (eff), agent of passive senten-ces (ag) etc., as is usual in the PragueLinguistic School.
Further, the example (4)and the related discussion guides us to addFUNC to the set of Head-features.Next, we shall consider the followingtriads o~ examples, all generated by thestandard GPSG grammar.

it is not a personal pronounwhich could be replaced by the referred nounas in "It (=the child) was bothered that Leewas elected.".
* And even if this were not thecase, the presence of the optionalNP {\[PREP by\]} would in any ease rule thegrammatJeal ity of such sentences out.Thus, some strings are generated by thestandard GPSG grammar that are ungrammaticalwhile, on the other hand, such sentences as(13) cannot be generated by the grammar, sin-9e the verb "hope" is introduced by an ID-rule as in (14), where the role of directobject is played by a subordinated clauserather than by an accusative NP, and thus theconstruction cannot undergo passivization viathe Passive Metarule (8).
Similar situationoccurs with "concede" etc., cf.
(15).

:Another important point in "the j)assivi-zatlon process (as viewed in transformationalgrammars) is that the direct ob 'e~ in activeconstruction becomes the sub~@_~% in the pas-sive one.
In the GPSG framework, this shiftmust be reflected in the passive counterpartof the active ID-rule , otherwise the grammarwill generate (16)b as the passive counter-part of (16)a, while, again, i% will not bepossible to generate (13), for the FSD11,assumed in (Gazdar,Klein,Pul lum and Sag,85)and repeated here as (17), will force the\[AOR NPffNF0m~ norm\]}\] to be Instantiated onthe V O and thus will rule out the possibil ityof non-NP subject occurring in {he sentence I .(16)a.
Everybody hoped that he would sing.b.
*He was hoped (by everybody).
(17) FSD11:{iv,+\] ,\[.BAR ,0\]} ~ {\[A~R NP{\[NFOI~ norm\]}\]}To make the transition of (active) direct ob-Ject to (passive) subject explicit, we firstmark all the direct objects in the lexicalID-rules in the metagrammar wlth the feature-value pair \[FUNC dobj\] , and, second, aug-ment the Passive Netarule with the require-ment that the passive VP agree with the cate-gory of active direct object.
Thus we arriveto the shape (18) of Passive Metarule forDirect Objects.495(18) Passive Metarule for Direct ObjectsVPf(\[AGR X\]))  -------> W,Y {\[FUNC dobj\]}VP{pas,\[AQR Y\]}-----~ W,t(X){\[FUNC a~\]})Several remarks concerning (18): first, the"variable" X stands for the same category inthe whole me~arule, and this is also 'the casewith Y.
Second, the bracket pairs "(" and ")"mark off mutually bound optionality when usedaround the same category - in this rule -thecase is that of (\[AGR X\]) and (X), i .
eo  con-oern ing  \[AGR X\] , either there  is \[AGP X\] inthe mother of the pattern rule and then, con-sequen?1y, X {\[FUNC ag\]} occurs as the licens--ing category of optional agent complement inthe target rule, or there is no \[AO}~ X\] inthe pattern rule ana then j us t  {\[FUNC ag\]}isthe l icensing category of the optional agent,all other features \].eft to later instantiat-ion.
This is important to allow for (19)a,b;note, however, that the verbs in %hls exampleare of different subcategorization classesV\[2\] and V\[20\] , respectively 2.(19)a.
Lee was bothered by K im.b.
Lee was bothered(that) Kim was elected.To prevent strings like those in (20) to be~enerated, we have to introduce FSD (21)which marks all categories containing\[~'T~NC ag\] as NP{\[PREP by\]\] ; if this does notcontradict some other principle of featureinstantiation (which is not the case with"bother" in (19)b, because here the agent isalready marked as S by the l icensing rule) 3(20)a.

This move, however, together with exam-Dies (24) and analogs ((24)b will be of par-ticular interest), will lead us to a profoundreconsideration of the roles and mutual rela-tions of features COMP/PREP and FUNC.
Thematter is that, given the metagrammar in itscurrent shape, (24)b cannot be generated, be-cause FUNC is considered to be a Head featureand -thus, in virtue of the Head Feature Con-vention, \[FUNC subj\] will be forced on thesecond subject sentence; but since this willbe lacking the \[COMP that\] specif ication, itwill bemarked  as unacceptable by (23).(22)a.

For inspiration,\].et us turn to the classical and well-knownanalogy between verbs with complementizersand nouns  w i th  prepos i t ions  , shown in(25) ,(26).(25)a.
That Sandy was dismissed bothered I, ee .bo*Sandy was dismissed bothered Lee?
(26)ao Kim waited for Leslie.b.~Kim waited Leslie?At first glance, there is some disci.epancybetween (24)b and (25)b, in respect to thebasic idea of coordination in (Gazdar,Klein,Pullum and Sag,85), namely that each memberof a coordinated construction should be ableto appear alone in place of the entire coor-dination structure.
The same case will be,naturally, that of (26)b and (27)?
(27) Kim waited fox.
Lee and Leslie.Of course, the matter is that in (24)b and(27) the COMP and.
PREP, respectively, belongto the whole coordination, not to its firstmember solely, and -thus extracting the secondmember to stand alone as shown in (25)b,(26)bis wrong - it is, in fact, not the wholesecond member being extracted; one its indi-visible part gets lost somehow, and thus itis only natural that the result ing string isungrammatical.
The second observation %o bemade is by far more important in its scope:from the comparison of examples (25)a vs.(25)b and (26)a vs. (26)b, it i.s clear thatthe role of constituent having some functionin the sentence can be played only by a ful-i/f__~eeified phrase of the appropriate type(i.e., in (25), the role of (sentential) sub-ject by a sentence containing "that"-comple-ment, in (26), the role of (prepositional)object by a noun phrase containing the con-cerned preposition).
And the same holds alsovice versa, i.e.
no underspeclf ied phrase canplay the role of the constituent having thefunction in question.
In other words, when-ever the complement or preposit ion is expan.-ded in the generation process, the "rest" ofthe phrase must not be any more marked ashaving the function the "whole" phrase has.This is just what is expressed in the COMPand PREP expansion rules (28)a,b.

ConclusionsIt was shown that a new feature denotingsyntactic function of a phrase should probab-ly be added to the feature system of GPSG,which will help make the theory more ade-quate.
This feature proved to be useful notonly in some technical it ies, but even in theintuitive and explanatory background of thetheory.
The bulk of support material forthis new feature was taken from passiviza-%ion of constructions with direct object inthis paper, but similar evidence for the newfeature can be drawn also from other types ofpassivization (of constructions with indirectobjects, p:ceposltional complements ("A doctorwas sent for.")
or adjuncts ("This bed hasbeen slept in.
")), as well as from othertypes of extraposit ion (cf.
the impossibi l i tyof generating sentences like "It w~s hoped byeverybody that he would sing."
in the stan-dard GPSG) and yet other sources.Adding the syntactic function feature to"the GPSG (mete)grammar goes in certain as-pects in parallel with the independently mo-tivated efforts to eliminate metarules fromGPSG altogether and/or to shift their work tolexical redundancy rules, e.g.
(Pollard,85),(Kilbury,86).
This fact only confirms the oldwisdom that, given some linguistic informat-ion, the Question of dividing it betweengrammar and lexicon may be decided rather ar-bitrarily.
The i~or tant  point is that theproposals made here do not require such radi-cal changes in the GPSG framework as the "le-xlcal" approaches do, i.e., they keep betterthe basic spirit of the current GPSG (whilesolving the problems shown at least equallywell).
The only points in which a really sub-stantial change occurred in this paper was,first, the structure of PP, and, second, thestipulation that purely morphological chara-cteristics of constituents is insufficientfor the descript ion of English syntax.
Put Ihope that in the light of the data presentedthese moves appear to be fully Justified.Notes:I am indebted to Eva Haji~ov&, Petr Sgail,Alexandr Rosen and an unknown Coling refereefor fruitful comments on the first version ofthis paper, as well as to Laura Janda for alot of the English examples.I) The status and val idity of this FSD ishowever, somewhat unclear: it forces\[AGR NP {INFORM norm\]}\] to all verbal predica-tes which are ,lot marked otherwise in therespective ID-rule.
Consequently, such verbsas "bother" must be listed in the lexicontwice', each time with different subcategori-zatlon class, but in both cases subcategorlz-ing fox' identical complements (and, hence,there have to be two almost identical lexicalrules in the grammar, one for each of theclasses).
This, in turn, makes the (otherwiseisimple and clear) sentence (i) ambiguous,wh i le  on the other hand, due to this FSD noneof the sentences in (ii),(ii l) can be gene-rated.
(i) Kim was bothered.
(li) That John would not come was obvious.That Kim was electedgave Sandy the satisfaction.
( i i i ) I t  was obv iousthat John would not come.It gave Sandy the satisfactionthat Kim was elected.On closer observation, a lot of verbs can(appropriate pragmatic conditions provided)take a sentential subject: the ~brute force"method for coping with this fact would be toincrease the size of rules and lexlcal en-tries , as performed with "bother" and ana-logs in (Oazdar,Klein,Pullum and Sag,85).More appropriate solution (at least in  myopinion) would be to soften the FSD11 to theform (iv), and simultaneously to stipulatethat only verbs 'taking exclusively sententlalsubject (if they exist) or exclusively nomi-nal subject (e.g.
"believe","hope") would bemarked as such?
