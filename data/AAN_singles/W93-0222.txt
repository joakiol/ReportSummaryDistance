Assumptions Underlying Discourse Relations: Which onesreally there and where are they?Mar ie  MeteerRensse laer  Po ly techn ic  Ins t i tu teTroy, NY  12180met eer?cs, rpi.
eduareThe goal of this paper is to challenge some of tile assumptions that have been inherent in much ofthe research on discourse relations, especially that which has gone on in the context of text planning.The primary assumption has been that there is only one set of relations, encompassing structural,rhetorical, and intentional information.
The second assumption is that these relations only operateat the clause level and above.
These are best exeml)lified by Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann &Tholnpson 1987), I)ut appear to some degree in ahnost all approaches to discourse.In what follows, we make three points:2.3.Given what is directly evidenced in a text, there is no justification for the conventional pproachto discourse relations, which conflates the various kinds of information in the discourse.Rhetorical relations can appear at any level of text, within and between clauses, and there isno justification for requiring that there be a specific relation between all segments of text.Intentions control tile decision making of the text rather and do not necessarily appear explic-itly in the structure of the text.Evidence from the textWe begin by working bottom up fi'om what is evidenced irectly ill tile text.
'l~xt has constituent structure both below the level of the clause (studied by syntacticians) andabove the level of the clause (studied by those working in discourse).
One kind of evidence forconstituent structure above the clause level is tile pattern of pronominalization (e.g.
Grosz & Sidner's(1986) attentional structure).
Others include orthographic markers (e.g.
indenting paragraphs) andin ton ation.?
"Relations", such ms contrast, sequence, causality exist in the text and are directly evidencedby lexical items, such as "cue words" (l~eichman 1985).82?
Intentions are evidenced indirectly by the fact that language is a goal directed activity.Discourse theories, such as RST, conflate these three kinds of information into one, as shown in thefollowing:We consider discourse to be a structured collection of clauses.
This structure is expressedby the nesting of segments of the discourse; .... Each discourse segment has an associatedpurpose .
.
.
.
i.e.
a communicative goal.
Each adjacent pair of such purl)oses is relatedin the discourse structure by one or more discourse structure relations, \[following RST\](tlovy, el.
al.
1992))This approach, while identifying three kinds of information, structural, intentional, and rhetorical,forces them to be isomorphic.
Yet no justif ication is provided for this assumption.Moore & Pollack (1993) argue for separating different kind of relations that hold between textsby introducing different "levels" at which segments of text can be related.
~.
They argue thatsome relations are "informational" (e.g.
volitional cause) and other relations are "intentional" (e.g.evidence), and they say of one their examples: "The intentional and informational structures forthis discourse are not isomorphic".
One can conclude from this that at least one of these structuresmust non-isomorphic with the constituent structure of the discourse, although the attthors do notdiscuss what the exact relationship between these structures is.Rhetorical RelationsRhetorical relations, as they are generally defined, function to provide coherence to the text.
While itis clear that information in a text is connected by relations uch as sequence, purl)ose, causality, etc.,it is not clear that (a) the relations are between consecutive segments of text.
that are clause-sizedor larger, (b) all such segments are related by a single, specific relation.As discussed in Meteer (1993), relations uch as "causation" can appear within a clause a.s w~ll asbetween clauses, ms shown by the following:(1) My flicking the switch ca.used the light to turn on.
(2) Because I flicked the switch, the light turned onFurthermore, these alternatives offer different options for what information to include.
For examph~,the clause version shown in (3) allows the speaker to omit tense and agent information whereas in(4) the speaker can switch the order of the information.
(3) Flicking tile switch causes the light to turn on.
(4) The light turns oil because someone flicks the switch.1 From a paper describing joint work ill text planning on the Penman Project at ISI/USC in California l|d theKomet project at GMD-IPSI in Darnmtadt, Germany.2Unfortunately, their use of "level" to describe these different kinds of information is easily confuse with the useof "level" to mean stage of processing.83An approach that makes relations between clauses the province of the text planner and those withinclauses the province of the linguistic component cannot offer these different versions as alternatives.
(Sec Meteer 1992 for a filrther discussion of this problem.
)I n tent ions  in D iscourseWhile it is clear that intentions play an important role in discourse, there is no evidence for a specialset, of intentional relations that operate only at the discourse level.
The speaker needs to keep trackof intensions, for example to answer follow up questions (Moore & Paris 1989) and the hearer needsto recognize intentions in order to recognize the speaker's plan (e.g.
Litman 1985).
But there are norequirements in either of these tasks that the intentions be isomorphic to the constituent structureof the text.In fact, l would argue that "intentional structure" is a misnomer, but rather intentions are whatcontrol the decision making.
Occasionally, there is direct evidence of these intentions in thc text,for example, in the first sentence of this paper: "The goal of this paper is...".
However, for the mostpart, intentions are implicit; they are a function of the information being communicated, ratherthan a function of the structure of the text.
This should not be surprising, since there are manykinds of inferences one can get from a text that is not directly reflected in its structure, and froman understanding perspective, the intentions of the speaker are just one more inference.From a generation perspective, there needs to be an intensional model-a model of the mind ofthe speaker-with explicit goals, intentions, so that decisions can be made coherently.
Little workis (lone on inteutionality in utterances, because few underlying programs are structured in thisway.
Underlying programs need to be coherent entities with goals, or there can be no notion of"intentionality".References(\]rosz, B.
