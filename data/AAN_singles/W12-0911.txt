Nonethe-less, children successfully learn to use themand eventually acquire a number of Mul-tiword Expressions comparable to that ofsimplex words.
In this paper we reporta wide-coverage investigation of a partic-ular type of MWE: verb-particle construc-tions (VPCs) in English and their usagein child-produced and child-directed sen-tences.
Given their potentially higher com-plexity in relation to simplex verbs, weexamine whether they appear less promi-nently in child-produced than in child-directed speech, and whether the VPCsthat children produce are more conserva-tive than adults, displaying proportionallyreduced lexical repertoire of VPCs or ofverbs in these combinations.
The resultsobtained indicate that regardless of any ad-ditional complexity VPCs feature widely inchildren data following closely adult usage.Studies like these can inform the develop-ment of computational models for languageacquisition.1 IntroductionThere has been considerable discussion aboutthe challenges imposed by Multiword Expres-sions (MWEs) which in addition to crossing wordboundaries act as a single lexical unit at some lev-els of linguistic analysis (Calzolari et al, 2002;Sag et al, 2002; Fillmore, 2003).
They include awide range of grammatical constructions such asverb-particle constructions (VPCs), idioms, com-pound nouns and listable word configurations,such as terminology and formulaic linguistic units(Wray, 2009).
Depending on the definition, theymay also include less traditional sequences likecopy of in They gave me a copy of the book (Fill-more et al, 1988), greeting formulae like howdo you do?, and lexical bundles such as I dontknow whether or memorized poems and famil-iar phrases from TV commercials (Jackendoff,1997).
These expressions may have reduced syn-tactic flexibility, and be semantically more opaqueso that their semantics may not be easily inferredfrom their component words.
For instance, to playdown X means to (try to) make X seem less im-portant than it really is and not literally a playingevent.These expressions may also breach generalsyntactic rules, sometimes spanning phrasalboundaries and often having a high degree of lex-icalisation and conventionality.
They form a com-plex of features that interact in various, often un-tidy, ways and represent a broad continuum be-tween non-compositional (or idiomatic) and com-positional groups of words (Moon, 1998).
In ad-dition, they are usually sequences or groups ofwords that co-occur more often than would be ex-pected by chance, and have been argued to appearin the same order of magnitude in a speaker?s lex-icon as the simplex words (Jackendoff, 1997).In terms of language acquisition difficultiesmay arise as the interpretation of these expres-sions often demands more knowledge than justabout (1) unitary words and (2) word-to-word re-lations.
This introduces a distinction betweenwhat a learner is able to computationally disam-biguate or figure out automatically from languageand what must be explicitly stored/memorizedand retrieved whole from memory at the time of43use, rather than being subject to generation oranalysis by the language grammar (Wray, 2009,p.
9).
Yet, according to Fillmore et al (1988),in an ideal learning environment, most of theknowledge about how to use a language shouldbe computable while explicitly memorized se-quences should be kept to a minimum.Due to these idiosyncrasies they have beennoted as easily phonetically mislearned: e.g.
byand large mistaken for by in large, to all in-tents and purposes for to all intensive purposes,and an arm and a leg for a nominal egg (Fill-more, 2003).
For second language (L2) learn-ers in particular (Wray, 2002) MWEs are in-deed a well-known cause of problems and lesslikely to be used by them than by native speak-ers in informal spoken contexts (Siyanova andSchmitt, 2007).
Even if L2 learners may be capa-ble of producing a large number of MWEs, theirunderlying intuitions and fluency do not matchthose of native speakers (Siyanova and Schmitt,2008) and they may produce marked combina-tions that are not conventionally used together(e.g.
plastic surgery/?operation, strong/?powerfultea) (Pearce, 2002; Siyanova and Schmitt, 2007).Given the potential additional sources of com-plexity of MWEs for learning, in this paper weinvestigate whether children shy away from us-ing them when they communicate.
We focus ona particular type of MWEs, VPCs, which presenta wide range of syntactic and semantic idyosin-crasies examining whether children produce pro-portionally less VPCs than adults.
In addition, weanalyze whether any potential added processingcosts for VPCs are reflected in a reduced choiceof VPCs or verbs to form these combinations inchild-produced sentences compared to adult us-age.
Finally, given the possibility of flexible wordorders in VPCs with the verb and particle not onlyoccurring adjacently but also with an NP objectbetween them, we compare these two groups interms of distances between the verb and the par-ticle in these combinations, to determine whetherthere is a preference for a joint or a split config-uration and if children and adults adopt distinctstrategies for their usage.
By profiling the VPCusage by children our aim is to provide the basisfor a computational modeling of the acquisition ofthese constructions.This paper is structured as follows: in sec-tion 2 describes VPCs and related works; sec-tion 3 presents the resources and methods used inthis paper.
The analyses of VPCs in children andadults sentences are in section 4.
We finish withconclusions and possibilities of future works.2 Related WorkVPCs are combinations of verbs and prepositional(up, down, ...), adverbial (away, back,...), adjecti-val (short,...) or verbal (go, be,...) particles, and inthis work we focus on VPCs with prepositional oradverbial particles like put off and move on.
Froma language acquisition perspective, the complex-ity of VPCs arises from their wide syntactic assemantic variability.Syntactically, like simplex verbs, VPCs can oc-cur in different subcategorisation frames (e.g.
in-transitive in break down and transitive in print NPup).
However, the type of verb and the num-ber of arguments of a VPC seem to have animpact in learning as both children with typicaldevelopment and with specific language impair-ments (SLI) seem to use obligatory arguments andinflectional morphology more consistently withgeneral all purpose verbs, like make, go, do, put,than with more specific verbs.
Moreover, as thenumber of obligatory arguments increases chil-dren with SLI seem to produce more general andfewer specific verbs (Boynton-Hauerwas, 1998).Goldberg (1999b) refers to these verbs as lightverbs, suggesting that due to their frequency ofuse, they are acquired earlier by children, and sub-sequently act as centers of gravity from whichmore specific instances can be learnt.
These verbsare very common and frequent in the everydaycommunication, that could be used in place ofmore specialized instances (e.g.
make instead ofbuild).In transitive VPCs there is the additional diffi-culty of the particle appearing in different wordorders in relation to the verb: in a joint configu-ration, adjacent to the verb (e.g.
make up NP) orin a split configuration after the NP complement(make NP up) (Lohse et al, 2004).
While someVPCs can appear in both configurations, othersare inseparable (run across NP), and a learner hasto successfully account for these.
Gries (2002)using a multifactorial analysis to investigate 25variables that could be linked to particle place-ment like size of the direct object (in syllablesand words), type of NP (pronoun or lexical), typeof determiner (indefinite or definite).
For a set44of 403 VPCs from the British National Corpushe obtains 84% success in predicting (adult) na-tive speakers?
choice.
Lohse et al (2004) proposethat these factors can be explained by consider-ations of processing efficiency based on the sizeof the object NP and on semantic dependenciesamong the verb, the particle, and the object.
In asimilar study for children Diessel and Tomasello(2005) found that the type of the NP (pronoun vslexical NP) and semantics of the particle (spatialvs non-spatial) were good predictors of placementon child language data.Semantically, one source of difficulties forlearners comes from the wide spectrum of compo-sitionality that VPCs present.
On one end of thespectrum some combinations like take away com-positionally combine the meaning of a verb withthe core meaning of a particle giving a sense ofmotion-through-location (Bolinger, 1971).
OtherVPCs like boil up are semi-idiomatic (or aspec-tual) and the particle modifies the meaning of theverb adding a sense of completion or result.
At theother end of the spectrum, idiomatic VPCs liketake off, meaning to imitate have an opaque mean-ing that cannot be straightforwardly inferred fromthe meanings of each of the components literally.Moreover, even if some verbs form combinationswith almost every particle (e.g., get, fall, go,...),others are selectively combined with only a fewparticles (e.g., book and sober with up), or do notcombine well with them at all (e.g., know, want,resemble,...) (Fraser, 1976).
Although there aresome semi-productive patterns in these combina-tions, like verbs of cooking and the aspectual up(cook up, boil up, bake up), and stative verbs notforming VPCs, for a learner it may not be clearwhether an unseen combination of verb and parti-cle is indeed a valid VPC that can be produced ornot.
Sawyer (1999) longitudinal analysis of VPCsin child language found that children seem to treataspectual and compositional combinations differ-ently, with the former being more frequent andemploying a larger variety of types than the lat-ter.
The sources of errors also differ and whilefor compositional cases the errors tend to be lexi-cal, for aspectuals there is a predominance of syn-tactic errors such as object dropping, which ac-counts for 92% of the errors in split configura-tion for children under 5 (Sawyer, 1999).
Chil-dren with SLI tended to produce even more objectdropping errors for VPCs than children with typ-ical development, despite both groups producingequivalent numbers of VPCs (Juhasz and Grela,2008).
Given that compositionality seems to havean impact on learning, to help reduce avoidanceof phrasal verbs Sawyer (2000) proposes a seman-tic driven approach for second language learningwhere transparent compositional cases would bepresented first to help familiarization with wordorder variation, semi-idiomatic cases would betaught next in groups according to the contribu-tion of the particle (e.g telicity or completive-ness), and lastly the idiomatic cases that need tobe memorized.In this paper we present a wide coverage ex-amination of VPC distributions in child producedand child-directed sentences, comparing whetherchildren reproduce the linguistic environment towhich they are exposed or whether they presentdistinct preferences in VPC usage.3 Materials and MethodsFor this work we use the English corpora fromthe CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 1995)containing transcriptions of child-produced andchild-directed speech from interactions involvingchildren of different age groups and in a varietyof settings, from naturalistic longitudinal studiesto task oriented latitudinal cases.
These corporaare available in raw, part-of-speech-tagged, lem-matized and parsed formats (Sagae et al, 2010).Moreover the English CHILDES Verb Construc-tion Database (ECVCD) (Villavicencio et al,2012) also adds for each sentence the RASP pars-ing and grammatical relations (Briscoe and Car-roll, 2006), verb semantic classes (Levin, 1993),age of acquisition, familiarity, frequency (Colt-heart, 1981) and other psycholinguistic and dis-tributional characteristics.
These annotated sen-tences are divided into two groups according tothe speaker annotation available in CHILDES, theAdults Set and the Children Set contain respec-tively all the sentences spoken by adults and bychildren1, as shown in table 1 as Parsed.VPCs in these corpora are detected by look-ing in the RASP annotation for all occurrencesof verbs followed by particles, prepositions andadverbs up to 5 words to the right, followingBaldwin (2005), shown as Sentences with VPCs1For the latter sentences which did not contain informa-tion about age were removed.45Sentences Children Set Adults SetParsed 482,137 988,101with VPCs 44,305 83,098with VPCs Cleaned 38,326 82,796% with VPCs 7.95 8.38Table 1: VPCs in English Corpora in the Childrenand Adults Setsin table 1.
The resulting sentences are subse-quently automatically processed to remove noiseand words mistagged as verbs.
For these candi-dates with non-alphabetic characters, like @ ina@l up, were removed as were those that did notinvolve verbs (e.g.
di, dat,), using the ComlexLexicon as reference for verb validity (Macleodand Grishman, 1998).
The resulting sets are listedas Sentences with VPCs Cleaned in table 1.
Theanalyses reported in this paper use these sen-tences, and the distribution of VPCs per childrenage group is shown in table 2.
Given the non-uniform amounts of VPC for each age group, andthe larger proportion of VPC sentences in youngerages in these corpora, we consider children as aunique group.
For these, the individual frequen-cies of the verb, the particle and the VPC are col-lected separately in the children set and in theadult set, using the mwetoolkit (Ramisch et al,2010).Age in months VPC Sentences0-24 2,79924-48 26,15248-72 8,03872-96 1,337>96 514No age 4,841Table 2: VPCs in Children Set per AgeTo evaluate the VPCs in these sets, we use:?
English VPC dataset (Baldwin, 2008); whichlists 3,078 VPCs with valency (intransitiveand transitive) information;?
Comlex lexicon (Macleod and Grishman,1998) containing 10,478 phrasal verbs;?
the Alvey Natural Language Tools (ANLT)lexicon (Carroll and Grover, 1989) with6,351 phrasal verbs.4 VPCs in Child LanguageTo investigate whether any extra complexity in theacquisition of VPCs is reflected in their reducedpresence in child-produced than in child-directedsentences, we compare the proportion of VPCs inthe Children and Adults Sets, table 3.
In absoluteterms adults produced more than double the num-ber of VPCs that children did.
However, giventhe differences in size of the two sets, in relativeterms there was a similar proportion of VPC us-age in these corpora for each of the groups: 7.95%of the sentences produced by children containedVPCs vs 8.38% of those by adults.
Moreover, thefrequencies with which these VPCs are used byboth children and adults reflects the Zipfian distri-bution found for the use of words in natural lan-guages, with a large part of the VPCs occurringjust once in the data, table 4.
In addition, in termsof frequency, children?s production of VPCs re-sembles that of the adults.Total VPC Children Set Adults SetTokens 38,326 82,796Types 1,579 2,468Table 3: VPC usage in CHILDESFrequency Children Set Adults Set1 42.62% 43.03%2 13.05% 15%3 8.36% 6.48%4 4.05% 4.5%?5 31.92% 31%Table 4: VPC types per frequencyAnother possible source of divergence betweenchildren and adults is in the lexical variety foundin VPCs.
The potential difficulties with VPCsmay be manifested in children producing a re-duced repertoire of VPCs or using a smaller setof verbs to form these combinations.
As shown intable 3, adults, as expected, employ a larger VPCvocabulary with 1.56 more types than children.However, an examination of the distributions oftypes reveals that they only differ by a scale.
Asa result when children frequencies are multipliedby a factor of 2.16, which corresponds to the ra-tio between VPC tokens used by adults and chil-dren (table 3), the resulting distribution has a very46good match with the adult distribution, see fig-ure 1.
Therefore, the lower number of VPC typesused by children can be explained totally by thelower number of sentences they produced, and thehypothesis that difficulties in VPCs would lead totheir avoidance is not confirmed by the data.Nonetheless, there is a discrepancy betweenthe distributions found for the higher frequencyVPCs.
Children have a more uniform distributionand adults tend to repeat more often the higherfrequency combinations (top left corner of fig-ure 1).
An evidence that this discrepancy is partic-ular for high frequency VPCs, and not their con-stituent verbs, is shown in figure 2.
This figuredisplays the rank plot for the verbs present in theVPCs, for both adults and children.
The samescale factor used in figure 1 is applied to compen-sate for the lower number of VPC sentences in thechildren set.
This time the match is extraordinary,spanning the whole vocabulary.100 102 104100101102103104105rankfrequencyVPC Usageadultschildren*Figure 1: VPC Usage Frequency vs Ranking.
Thechildren frequency is scaled to match adult totalVPC usage.Ranks however, might not tell the whole story.It is important to verify if the same VPCs andverbs are present in the both vocabularies, and fur-ther if their orders in the ranks are similar.
Thetwo groups have very similar preferences for VPCusage, with a Kendall ?
score of 0.63 which indi-cates that they are highly correlated, as Kendall?
ranges from -1 to 1.
Furthermore they use avery similar set of verbs in VPCs, with a Kendall100 102 104100101102103104105rankfrequencyVerbs in VPCs Usageadultschildren*Figure 2: Verbs in VPCs Usage Frequency vsRanking.

score of 0.84 pointing to a very strong corre-lation.
We find less agreement between the or-ders of VPCs and verbs for both children andadults, indicating that the order of the verbs inthe data is not predictive of the relative frequen-cies of VPCs.
We examined (a) if children?s VPCranks followed their verb ranks, (b) if adults VPCranks followed their verb ranks and (c) if chil-dren?s VPC ranks followed adults?
verb ranks.The resulting Kendall scores were around 0.2 forall three cases.
Moreover, if the lower frequencyVPCs are removed to avoid potential cases ofnoise, the Kendall ?
score for VPCs by adults andchildren increases with the threshold, second linefrom the top in Figure 3, while it remains constantfor all the other cases.
As an example, the top 10VPC types used by children and adults are listedin table 5.
From these, 9 out of the 10 are thesame differing only in the order in which they ap-pear.
Most of these combinations are listed in oneof the dictionaries used for evaluation: 72% foradults and 75.87% for children.
When a thresh-old of at least 5 counts is applied these values goup to 87.72% for adults and 79.82% for children,as would be expected.
This indicates that besidesany possible lack of coverage for child-directedVPCs in the lexicons or noise, it is in the lowerfrequency combinations that novel and domainsspecific non-standard usages can be found.

score per VPC frequencythresholdFinally, despite adults having a larger verb vo-cabulary used in VPCs than children, the twogroups have similar ratios of verb per VPCs: 2.81VPCs for children and 2.79 for adults, table 6.The top verbs used in VPCs types are also respon-sible for very frequent VPC tokens (e.g.
go, get,come, take, put, make and move) accounting for5.83% VPC types and 43.76% tokens for adultsand 7.02% of the types and 47.81% of the to-kens for children, confirming the discrepancy dis-cussed earlier.
These are very general verbs andsome of the most frequent in the data, reportedamong the first to be learned (Goldberg, 1999a)which may facilitate their acquisition and use inVPCs.Comparing VPC types used by children and byadults, this trend is confirmed: a large proportion(72.32%) of the VPC types that children use isalso used by adults, Children ?
Adult in table 6.When low frequency VPCs types are removed,this proportion increases (89.48%).
Moreover,when the VPCs used only by the adults are con-sidered, most of these (93.44%) occur with fre-quency lower than 5.
This suggests that childrentend to follow quite closely the combinations em-ployed by adults, and the lower frequency casesmay not yet be incorporated in their active vocab-ulary.In terms of the distance between verb and par-ticle, there is a strong preference in the data forjoint combinations for both children and adults,table 7.
For the split cases, the majority containsonly one word between the verb and the particle.Children in particular display a slight disprefer-ence for longer distances between verbs and parti-cles, and over 97% of VPCs have at most 2 wordsbetween them.Distance Children Set Adults Set0 65.13% 64.14%1 23.48% 22.15%2 9.33% 10.90%3 1.65% 2.15%4 0.29% 0.47%5 0.09% 0.16%Table 7: Distance between verb and particle5 Conclusions and future workIn this paper we presented an investigation ofVPCs in child-produced and child-directed sen-tences in English to determine whether potentialcomplexities in the nature of these combinations48Children Adult Children ?Adult Children AdultVPCs VPCs VPCs only VPCs only VPCsVPCs 1579 2468 1142 437 1243Verb in VPCs 561 884 401 160 483Particle in VPCs 28 35 24 4 9VPCs ?

Childrenfollow very closely adult usage in terms of thetypes and are sensitive to their frequencies, dis-playing similar distributions to adults.
They alsoseem to use them in a similar manner in terms ofparticle placement.
Therefore no correction forVPC complexity was found in this data.Despite these striking similarities in many ofthe distributions, there are still some discrepan-cies between these two groups.
In particular in theVPC ranks, children present a more uniform dis-tribution for higher frequency VPCs when com-pared to adults.
Moreover, there is a modest butsignificant dispreference for longer distances be-tween verb and particle for children.
Whetherthese reflect different strategies or efficiency con-siderations deserves to be further investigated.AcknowledgementsThis research was partly supported by CNPqProjects 551964/2011-1, 202007/2010-3,305256/2008-4 and 309569/2009-5.ReferencesTimothy Baldwin.
