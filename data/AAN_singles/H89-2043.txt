SUMMARY OF SESSION 10 - Continous Speech Recognition IIGeorge Doddington, chairmanAlgorithms and techniques to improve the robustness of speech recognition were theprincipal theme in session 10.The session opened with two papers which addressed the compensation for noise andmicrophone characteristics.
Significant performance improvement was demonstrated.Michael Picheny made an important comment in response to these papers, namely that thesetechniques have been developed before.
Why are they not incorporated as a standard parto f  speech preprocessing for all speech recognition systems?Ostendorf presented work on the modeling of temporal correlation and discussed someinteresting techniques.
Although this work is in an early stage, the issues and ideas treatedmay be an area of great important to progress in speech recognition.
Although the work wascontrasted as being distinct from HMM, the general ideas could and should be applied usingHMM's as well.The session concluded with a paper on the use of decision trees in speech recognition andone on the use of parallel algorithms for improved speech recognition.309
