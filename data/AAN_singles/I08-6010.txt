Bengali and Hindi to English CLIR EvaluationDebasis Mandal, Sandipan Dandapat, Mayank Gupta, Pratyush Banerjee,Sudeshna SarkarAbstractOur participation in CLEF 2007 consisted of two Cross-lingual and onemonolingual text retrieval in the Ad-hoc bilingual track.
The cross-languagetask includes the retrieval of English documents in response to queries intwo Indian languages, Hindi and Bengali.
The Hindi and Bengali querieswere first processed using a morphological analyzer (Bengali), a stemmer(Hindi) and a set of 200 Hindi and 273 Bengali stop words.
The refinedhindi queries were then looked into the Hindi-English bilingual lexicon,?Shabdanjali?
(approx.
26K Hindi words) and all of the correspondingtranslations were considered for the equivalent English query generation, if amatch was found.
Rest of the query words were transliterated using theITRANS scheme.
For the Bengali query, we had to depend mostly on thetranslietrations due to the lack of any effective Bengali-English bilinguallexicon.
The final equivalent English query was then fed into the LuceneSearch engine for the monolingual retrieval of the English documents.
TheCLEF evaluations suggested the need for a rich bilingual lexicon, a goodNamed Entity Recognizer and a better transliterator for CLIR involvingIndian languages.
The best MAP values for Bengali and Hindi CLIR for ourexperiment were 7.26 and 4.77 which are 0.20 and 0.13 of our monolingualretrieval, respectively.
