hk1 In t roduct ionIn recent years, there is a phenomenal growthin the amount of online text material availablefrom the greatest information repository knownas the World Wide Web.
Various traditionalinformation retrieval(IR) techniques combinedwith natural language processing(NLP) tech-niques have been re-targeted to enable efficientaccess of the WWW--search engines, indexing,relevance feedback, query term and keywordweighting, document analysis, document clas-sification, etc.
Most of these techniques aim atefficient online search for information already onthe Web.Meanwhile, the corpus linguistic communityregards the WWW as a vast potential of cor-pus resources.
It is now possible to downloada large amount of texts with automatic toolswhen one needs to compute, for example, alist of synonyms; or download domain-specificmonolingual texts by specifying a keyword tothe search engine, and then use this text to ex-tract domain-specific terms.
It remains to beseen how we can also make use of the multilin-gual texts as NLP resources.In the years since the appearance of the firstpapers on using statistical models for bilin-gual lexicon compilation and machine transla-tion(Brown et al, 1993; Brown et al, 1991;Gale and Church, 1993; Church, 1993; Simardet al, 1992), large amount of human effort andtime has been invested in collecting parallel cor-pora of translated texts.
Our goal is to alleviatethis effort and enlarge the scope of corpus re-sources by looking into monolingual, compara-ble texts.
This type of texts are known as non-parallel corpora.
Such nonparallel, monolingualtexts should be much more prevalent than par-allel texts.
However, previous attempts at usingnonparallel corpora for terminology translationwere constrained by the inadequate availabilityof same-domain, comparable texts in electronicform.
The type of nonparallel texts obtainedfrom the LDC or university libraries were of-ten restricted, and were usually out-of-date assoon as they became available.
For new wordtranslation, the timeliness of corpus resourcesis a prerequisite, so is the continuous and au-tomatic availability of nonparallel, comparabletexts in electronic form.
Data collection ef-fort should not inhibit the actual translationeffort.
Fortunately, nowadays the World WideWeb provides us with a daily increase of fresh,up-to-date multilingual material, together withthe archived versions, all easily downloadable bysoftware tools running in the background.
It ispossible to specify the URL of the online site ofa newspaper, and the start and end dates, andautomatically download all the daily newspapermaterials between those dates.In this paper, we describe a new methodwhich combines IR and NLP techniques to ex-tract new word translation from automaticallydownloaded English-Chinese nonparallel news-paper texts.2 Encounter ing  new wordsTo improve the performance ofa machine trans-lation system, it is often necessary to updateits bilingual lexicon, either by human lexicog-raphers or statistical methods using large cor-pora.
Up until recently, statistical bilingual ex-icon compilation relies largely on parallel cor-pora.
This is an undesirable constraint at times.In using a broad-coverage English-Chinese MTsystem to translate some text recently, we dis-covered that it is unable to translate ~,~,/li-ougan which occurs very frequently in the text.Other words which the system cannot find inits 20,000-entry lexicon include proper names414such as the Taiwanese president Lee Teng-Hui,and the Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-Hwa.
To our disappointment, we cannot lo-cate any parallel texts which include such wordssince they only start to appear frequently in re-cent months.A quick search on the Web turned up archivesof multiple local newspapers in English and Chi-nese.
Our challenge is to find the translation of~/l iougan and other words from this onlinenonparallel, comparable corpus of newspapermaterials.
We choose to use issues of the En-glish newspaper Hong Kong Standard and theChinese newspaper Mingpao, from Dec.12,97 toDec.31,97, as our corpus.
The English text con-tains about 3 Mb of text whereas the Chinesetext contains 8.8 Mb of 2 byte character texts.So both texts are comparable in size.
Since theyare both local mainstream newspapers, it is rea-sonable to assume that their contents are com-parable as well.3 YL~,/liougan is assoc ia ted  w i th  flubut  not  w i th  AfricaUnlike in parallel texts, the position of a wordin a text does not give us information about itstranslation in the other language.
(Rapp, 1995;Fung and McKeown, 1997) suggest hat a con-tent word is closely associated with some wordsin its context.
As a tutorial example, we postu-late that the words which appear in the contextof ~/l iougan should be similar to the wordsappearing in the context of its English trans-lation, flu.
We can form a vector space modelof a word in terms of its context word indices,similar to the vector space model of a text interms of its constituent word indices (Salton andBuckley, 1988; Salton and Yang, 1973; Croft,1984; Turtle and Croft, 1992; Bookstein, 1983;Korfhage, 1995; Jones, 1979).The value of the i-th dimension of a wordvector W is f if the i-th word in the lexiconappears f times in the same sentences as W.Left columns in Table 1 and Table 2 showthe list of content words which appear most fre-quently in the context of flu and Africa respec-tively.
The right column shows those which oc-cur most frequently in the context of ~,~,.
Wecan see that the context of ~ is more similarto that of flu than to that of Africa.Table 1: ~ and flu have similar contextsEnglish Freq.bird 170virus 26spread 17people 17government 13avian 11scare 10deadly 10new 10suspected 9chickens 9spreading 8prevent 8crisis 8health 8symptoms 7Chinese Freq.~ (virus) 147\ ] :~  (citizen) 90~ '~ (nong Kong) 84,~  (infection) 69~ (confirmed) 62~-~ (show) 62~ (discover) 56\[~\[\] (yesterday) 54~i~ j~ (patient) 53~i\ ]~ (suspected) 50~-  (doctor) 49~_t2 (infected) 47~y~ (hospital) 44~:~ (no) 42~ (government) 41$~1= (event) 40Table 2: ~ and Africa have different contextsEnglish Freq.South 109African 32China 20ties 15diplomatic 14Taiwan 12relations 9Test 9Mandela 8Taipei 7Africans 7January 7visit 6tense 6survived 6Beijing 6Chinese Freq.~ j~ (virus) 147~ (citizen) 90~ (Uong Kong) 84,~  (infection) 69-~J~ (confirmed) 62~p-~ (show) 62?

In a bilingual corpus, the "com-mon word" is actually a bilingual word pair.
Weuse the lexicon of the MT system to "bridge" allbilingual word pairs in the corpora.
These wordpairs are used as seed words.We found that the contexts of flu and ~,~/liougan share 233 "common" context words,whereas the contexts of Africa and ~,~/ l iouganshare only 121 common words, even though thecontext of flu has 491 unique words and the con-text of Africa has 328 words.In the vector space model, W\[flu\] andW\[liougan\] has 233 overlapping dimensions,whereas there are 121 overlapping dimensionsbetween W\[flu\] and W\[A frica\].4155 Us ing  TF / IDF  o f  contextua l  seedwordsThe flu example illustrates that the actual rank-ing of the context word frequencies provides asecond clue to the similarity between a bilingualword pair.
For example, virus ranks very highfor both flu and ~g~/l iougan and is a strong"bridge" between this bilingual word pair.
Thisleads us to use the term frequency(TF) mea-sure.
The TF of a context word is defined asthe frequency of the word in the context of W.(e.g.
TF of virus in flu is 26, in ~,~ is 147).However, the TF of a word is not indepen-dent of its general usage frequency.
In an ex-treme case, the function word the appears mostfrequently in English texts and would have thehighest TF in the context of any W. In our HK-Standard/Mingpao c rpus, Hong Kong is themost frequent content word which appears ev-erywhere.
So in the flu example, we would liketo reduce the significance of Hong Kong's TFwhile keeping that of virus.
A common way toaccount for this difference is by using the inversedocument frequency(IDF).
Among the variantsof IDF, we choose the following representationfrom (Jones, 1979):maxnIDF = log - -+ lniwhere maxn = the maximum frequency ofany word in the corpusni = the total number of occurrencesof word i in the corpusThe IDF of virus is 1.81 and that of HongKong is 1.23 in the English text.
The IDF of~,~ is 1.92 and that of Hong Kong is 0.83 inChinese.
So in both cases, virus is a stronger"bridge" for ~,~,/liougan than Hong Kong.Hence, for every context seed word i, we as-sign a word  we ight ing  factor  (Salton andBuckley, 1988) wi = TFiw x IDFi where TFiwis the TF of word i in the context of word W.The updated vector space model of word W haswi in its i-th dimension.The ranking of the 20 words in the contextsof ~/ l iougan is rearranged by this weightingfactor as shown in Table3.Table 3: virus is aKongbird 259.97spread 51.41virus 47.07avian 43.41scare 36.65deadly 35.15spreading 30.49suspected 28.83symptoms 28.43prevent 26.93people 23.09crisis 22.72health 21.97new 17.80government 16.04chickens 15.12stronger bridge than Hong~iij~ (virus) 282.70,1~, ~1~ (infection) 187.50i=~i~ (citizens) 163.49L I~ (confirmed) 161.89~\[-_ (infected) 158.43~ijj~ (patient) 132.14~ i~ (suspected) 123.08U~:~_ (doctor) 108.54U~ (hospital) 102.73~ (discover) 98.09~J~ : (event) 83.75~ (Hong Kong) 69.68\[~ \[\] (yesterday) 66.84~--~ (possible) 60.20~p-~ (no) 59.76~ (government) 59.416 Rank ing  t rans la t ion  cand idatesNext, a ranking algorithm is needed to matchthe unknown word vectors to their counterpartsin the other language.
A ranking algorithm se-lects the best target language candidate for asource language word according to direct com-parison of some similarity measures (Frakes andBaeza-Yates, 1992).We modify the similarity measure proposedby (Salton and Buckley, 1988) into the followingSO:so(wc, We) =t .2  ~/~'~i=l Wzcwhere Wic = TFicWie = T Fie~=1 (Wic X Wie )t 2 X Y\]~i=lWieVariants of similarity measures uch as theabove have been used extensively in the IR com-munity (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992).
Theyare mostly based on the Cosine Measure of twovectors.
For different asks, the weighting fac-tor might vary.
For example, if we add the IDFinto the weighting factor, we get the followingmeasure SI:tSI(Wc, We) = ~i=l(Wic ?
Wie)t .2  t 2 ~/~i=lWzc X ~i=lWiewhere wic = TFic x IDFiWie = TFie x IDFi416In addition, the Dice and Jaccard coefficientsare also suitable similarity measures for doc-ument comparison (Frakes and Baeza-Yates,1992).
We also implement he Dice coefficientinto similarity measure $2:t 2Ei=l (Wic X Wie)S2(W , We) = t .2  t .2  ~i=l W2c "~- ~i=l W~ewhere Wic = TFic x IDF iWie = TFie x IDF iS1 is often used in comparing a short querywith a document ext, whereas $2 is used incomparing two document exts.
Reasoning thatour objective falls somewhere in between--weare comparing segments of a document, we alsomultiply the above two measures into a thirdsimilarity measure $3.7 Conf idence  on  seed  word  pa i rsIn using bilingual seed words such as IN~/v i rusas "bridges" for terminology translation, thequality of the bilingual seed lexicon naturallyaffects the system output.
In the case of Eu-ropean language pairs such as French-English,we can envision using words sharing commoncognates as these "bridges".
Most importantly,we can assume that the word boundaries aresimilar in French and English.
However, thesituation is messier with English and Chinese.First, segmentation of the Chinese text intowords already introduces ome ambiguity of theseed word identities.
Secondly, English-Chinesetranslations are complicated by the fact thatthe two languages hare very little stemmingproperties, or part-of-speech set, or word order.This property causes every English word to havemany Chinese translations and vice versa.
In asource-target language translation scenario, thetranslated text can be "rearranged" and cleanedup by a monolingual language model in the tar-get language.
However, the lexicon is not veryreliable in establishing "bridges" between non-parallel English-Chinese texts.
To compensatefor this ambiguity in the seed lexicon, we intro-duce a conf idence  we ight ing  to each bilingualword pair used as seed words.
If a word ie is thek- th  candidate for word ic, then wi,~ = wi,~/ki.The similarity scores then become $4 and $5and $6 = $4 x $5:~=l(Wic ?

Usingsimilarity measures $3-$7 ,  the highest rankingcandidates of ~ are shown in Table 6.
$6 and$7 appear to be the best similarity measures.We then test the algorithm with $7 on moreChinese words which are not found in the lex-icon but which occur frequently enough in theMingpao texts.
A statistical new word extrac-tion tool can be used to find these words.
Theunknown Chinese words and their English coun-terparts, as well as the occurrence frequencies ofthese words in HKStandard/Mingpao are shownin Table 4.
Frequency numbers with a * in-dicates that this word does not occur frequentenough to be found.
Chinese words with a *indicates that it is a word with segmentationand translation ambiguities.
For example,(Lam) could be a family name, or part of an-other word meaning forest.
When it is used asa family name, it could be transliterated intoLam in Cantonese or Lin in Mandarin.Disregarding all entries with a * in the abovetable, we apply the algorithm to the rest of theChinese unknown words and the 118 English un-known words from HKStandard.
The output isranked by the similarity scores.
The highestranking translated pairs are shown in Table 5.The only Chinese unknown words which arenot correctly translated in the above list are417Table 4: Unknown words which occur oftenFreq.

Poultryin Chinese is closely related to flu because theChinese name for bird flu is poultry flu.
In fact,almost all unambiguous Chinese new words findtheir translations in the first 100 of the rankedlist.
Six of the Chinese words have correct trans-lation as their first candidate.9 Re lated workUsing vector space model and similarity mea-sures for ranking is a common approach inIR for query/text and text/text comparisons(Salton and Buckley, 1988; Salton and Yang,1973; Croft, 1984; Turtle and Croft, 1992; Book-stein, 1983; Korfhage, 1995; Jones, 1979).
Thisapproach has also been used by (Dagan and Itai,1994; Gale et al, 1992; Shiitze, 1992; Gale etal., 1993; Yarowsky, 1995; Gale and Church,1Lunar is not an unknown word in English, Yeltsinfinds its translation in the 4-th candidate.Table 5:tion outscore0.0084210.0078950.0076690.0075880.0072830.0068120.0064300.0062180.0059210.0055270.0053350.0053350.0052210.0047310.0044700.0042750.0038780.0038590.0038590.0037840.0036860.0035500.0035190.0034810.0034070.0034070.0033380.003324Some Chinese)utEnglishTeng-huiSARfluLeipoultrySARhijackpoultryTungDiaoyuPrimeMinisterPresidentChinaLienpoultryChinafluPrimeMinisterPresidentpoultryKalkanovpoultrySARZhuhaiPrimeMinisterPresidentfluapologiseunknown word transla-Chinese~}~ (Weng-hui)~ (~u)(Lei)~ j~ (Poultry)~ (Chee-hwa)~}~ (Teng-hui)~#~ (SAR)~ '~ (Chee-hwa):~  (Teng-hui)~}~ (Weng-hui)W}~ (Weng-hui)CLam)~}~ (Teng-hui)~-~ (Chee-hwa)~_}~ (Teng-hui)(Lei)~ '~ (Chee-hwa)~ '~ (Chee-hwa).~ (Leung)~ (Zhuhai)I~ (Lei)~ J~ (Yeltsin)~-~ (Chee-hwa))~ (Lam)(Lam)~ j~ (Poultry)W~ (Teng-hui)0.003250 DPP0.003206 Tang0.003202 Tung0.003040 Leung0.003033 China0.002888 Zhuhai0.002886 Tung~}~ (Teng-hui)(Tang)(Leung)(Leung)~#~ (SAR)~ (Lunar)(Tung)1994) for sense disambiguation between mul-tiple usages of the same word.
Some of theearly statistical terminology translation meth-ods are (Brown et al, 1993; Wu and Xia, 1994;Dagan and Church, 1994; Gale and Church,1991; Kupiec, 1993; Smadja et al, 1996; Kayand RSscheisen, 1993; Fung and Church, 1994;Fung, 1995b).
These algorithms all require par-allel, translated texts as input.
Attempts atexploring nonparallel corpora for terminologytranslation are very few (Rapp, 1995; Fung,1995a; Fung and McKeown, 1997).
Amongthese, (Rapp, 1995) proposes that the associ-ation between a word and its close collocateis preserved in any language, and (Fung andMcKeown, 1997) suggests that the associationsbetween a word and many seed words are alsopreserved in another language.
In this paper,418we have demonstrated that the associations be-tween a word and its context seed words arewell-preserved in nonparallel, comparable textsof different languages.10 Discuss ionsOur algorithm is the first to have generated acollocation bilingual exicon, albeit small, froma nonparallel, comparable corpus.
We haveshown that the algorithm has good precision,but the recall is low due to the difficulty inextracting unambiguous Chinese and Englishwords.Better results can be obtained when the fol-lowing changes are made:?
improve seed word lexicon reliability bystemming and POS tagging on both En-glish and Chinese texts;?
improve Chinese segmentation by using alarger monolingual Chinese lexicon;?
use larger corpus to generate more un-known words and their candidates by sta-tistical methods;We will test the precision and recall of thealgorithm on a larger set of unknown words.11 Conc lus ionsWe have devised an algorithm using contextseed word  TF / IDF  for extracting bilinguallexicon from nonpara l le l ,  comparab le  cor-pus  in English-Chinese.
This algorithm takesinto account the reliability of bilingual seedwords and is language independent.
This al-gorithm can be applied to other language pairssuch as English-French or English-German.
Inthese cases, since the languages are more sim-ilar linguistically and the seed word lexicon ismore reliable, the algorithm should yield bet-ter results.
This algorithm can also be appliedin an iterative fashion where high-ranking bilin-gual word pairs can be added to the seed wordlist, which in turn can yield more new bilingualword pairs.Re ferencesA.
