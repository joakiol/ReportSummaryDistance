nlAbstractThis paper contributes to the theory ofsubstructural logics .that are of interest ocategorial grammarians.
Combining se-mantic ideas of Hepple \[1990\] and Mor-rill \[1990\], proof-theoretic ideas of Venema\[1993b; 1993a\] and the theory of equationalspecifications, a class of resource-preservinglogics is defined, for which decidability andcompleteness theorems are established.1 IntroductionThe last decade has seen a keen revival of investi-gations into the suitability of using categorial gram-mars as theories of natural language syntax and se-mantics.
Initially, this research was for the largerpart confined to the classical categorial calculi of Aj-dukiewicz \[1935\] and Bar-Hillel \[1953\], and, in partic-ular, the Lambek cMculus L \[Lambek, 1958\], \[Moort-gat, 1988\] and some of its close relatives.Although it turned out to be easily applicable tofairly large sets of linguistic data, one couldn't real-istically expect he Lambek calculus to be able to ac-count for all aspects of grammar.
The reason for thisis the diversity of the constructions found in naturallanguage.
The Lambek calculus is good at reflect-ing surface phrase structure, but runs into problemswhen other linguistic phenomena are to be described.Consequently, recent work in categorial grammar hasshown a trend towards diversification of the ways inwhich the linguistic algebra is structured, with anaccompanying ramification of proof theory.One of the main innovations of the past few yearshas been the introduction of unary type connectives,usually termed modalities, that are used to reflectcertain special features linguistic entities may pos-sess.
This strand of research originates with Morrill\[1990\], who adds to L a unary connective O with thefollowing proof rules:F,B,F 'FA \[mL\] OF~-A \[oR\]F, OB, F ~ b A OF b DAOF here denotes a sequence of types all of whichhave O as their main connective.
The S4-1ike modal-ity o is introduced with the aim of providing an ap-propriate means of dealing with certain intensionalphenomena.
Consequently, O inherits Kripke's pos-sible world semantics for modal ogic.
The proof sys-tem which arises from adding Morrill's left and rightrules for \[\] to the Lambek calculus L will be calledLb.Hepple \[1990\] presents a detailed investigation i tothe possibilities of using the calculus L ?
to accountfor purely syntactic phenomena, notably the well-known Island Constraints of Ross \[1967\].
Startingfrom the usual interpretation of the Lambek calculusin semigroups L, where types are taken to denotesubsets of L, he proposes to let D refer to a fixedsubsemigroup Lo of L, which leads to the followingdefinition of its semantics:\[oAf = \[A\]n LoAs we have shown elsewhere \[Versmissen, 1992\] 1the calculus LD is sound with respect o this seman-tics, but not complete.
This can be remedied by1This paper discusses semigroup semmatics for L andLO in detail, and is well-suited as an easy-going in-troduction to the ideas presented here.

,  F,  ~- raA \[oR'\]Hepple \[1990\] also investigates the benefits of us-ing the so-called structural modalities originally pro-posed in \[Morrill et al, 1990\], for the descriptionof certain discontinuity 'and dislocality phenomena.The idea here is that such modalities allow a limitedaccess to certain structural rules.
Thus, we could forexample have a permutation modality rap with thefollowing proof rule (in addition to \[rapL\] and \[OpR'\]as before):r\[oeA, B\] ~ Cr\[8, opA\] ~- CThe symbol ~ here indicates that the inference isvalid in both directions.
The interpretation of ORwould then be taken care of by a subsemigroup Lopof L having the property that x ?
y = y ?
x wheneverz ?
Lnpory ?Lop .Alternatively, one could require all types in suchan inference to be boxed:F\[rapA, DpB\] I- CI r\[opB, OpA\] ~- CIn this case, Lop would have to be such that z.  y =y- x whenever z, y ?
Lop.Closely related to the use of structural modalitiesis the trend of considering different kinds of prod-uct connectives, ometimes combined into a singlesystem.
For example, Moortgat & Morrill \[1992\]present an account of dependency structure in termsof headed prosodic trees, using a calculus that pos-sesses two product operators instead of just one.
Onthe basis of this, Moortgat \[1992\] sketches a land-scape of substructural logics parametrized by prop-erties such as commutativity, associativity and de-pendency.
He then goes on to show how structuralmodalities can be used to locally enhance or con-strain the possibilities of type combination.
Morrill\[1992\] has a non-associative prosodic calculus, anduses a structural modality to reintroduce associativ-ity at certain points.The picture that emerges i the following.
Insteadof the single product operator of L, one considers arange of different product operators, reflecting differ-ent modes of linguistic structuring.
This results ina landscape of substructural logics, which are ulti-mately to be combined into a single system.
Specificlinguistic phenomena are given an account in termsof type constructors that are specially tailored fortheir description.
On certain occasions it is necessaryfor entities to 'escape' the rules of the type construc-tor that governs their behaviour.
This is achieved bymeans of structural modalities, which license con-trolled travel through the substructural landscape.Venema \[1993a\] proves a completeness theorem,with respect o the mentioned algebraic interpreta-tion, for the Lambek calculus extended with a per-mutation modality.
He modifies the proof system byintroducing a type constant Q which refers explicitilyto the subalgebra Lo.
This proof system is adaptedto cover a whole range of substructural logics in \[Ve-nema, 1993b\].
However, the semantics given in thatpaper, which is adopted from Dogen \[1988; 1989\], dif-fers in several respects from the one discussed above.Most importantly, models are required to possess apartial order with a well-behaved interaction withthe product operation.
In the remainder of this pa-per we will give a fairly general definition of the no-tion of a resource-preserving logic.
The proof theoryof these logics is based on that of Venema, while theirsemantics, with respect o which a completeness the-orem will be established, is similar to that of Heppleand Morrill.2 Resource-preserv ing logics withstructural  modal i t ies2.1 SyntaxThe languages of the logics that will be consideredhere are specified by the following parameters:t~ Three finite, disjoint index sets Z, J and/C;A finite set B of basic types.Given these, we define the following sets of expres-sions:The set of binary type connectivesc = {/i, \0~z ;Two sets of unary type connectivesM~ = {Aj}je.~ and M v = {~Tk}~?Jc;~, The set of type constantsq = {Qj}j~ u {Qk}kE~;The set of types T, being the inductive closureof B U Q under C U Mz~ U M e;The set of structural connectives SC = {oi}iez;The set of slructures S, being the inductive clo-sure of T under SC;c, The set of sequents {F b A I r ?
S,A ?
T}.The division of the unary type connectives into twosets Ma and M v reflects the alternatives mentionedin Section 1.
Modalities/Xj are those whose struc-tural rules only apply when all types involved areprefixed with them, whereas only a single type pre-fixed with XTk needs to be involved in order for theaccompanying structural rules to be applicable.2.2 Equational  specificationsWe will use equational specifications to describe thestructural behaviour of connectives and modalities,as well as the algebraic structures in which these areinterpreted.
To start with, we recall several impor-tant definitions and results.378A signature E is a collection of function symbols,each of which has a fixed arity.
Let V be a countablyinfinite set of variables.
The term algebra T(E, 1)) isdefined as the inductive closure of l; under ~.
Anequational specification is a pair (~,,~) where ~ is asignature and E is a set of equations  = t of termss,t E T(~,12).
A ~-algebra .4 is a set A togetherwith functions F A : A" --* A for all n-ary functionsymbols F E ~.
A E-algebra .4 is a model for a setof equations E over T(~, N), written as .4 ~ ?, ifevery equation of ~ holds in A.
A (E, g)-algebra isa ~-algebra that is a model for ?.Let E be an equational specification.
Then we de-fine Ezxi to be the equational specification obtainedfrom E by prefixing each variable occurrence withA~.
The equational specification Ev~ is defined asfollows (where V(F = G) denotes the set of variablesoccurring in F = G):(F=G)lx*'-Vkz\] mD FI~*-vkxl=G\[x*"Vkx\](F=G)v/, =O UzCV(F=o) (F=G)\[z*-Vk*\]?vk --D UEE~r Ev~To give a concrete xample of these definitions, let Econsist of the following two equations:x+y = y+xx+(y+z)  = (x+y)+zThen ~ contains these two:A j z+Ajy  = Ajy  + A jxA~x+(A~y+Aiz  ) = (A jx+A~y)+A~zwhereas gw is comprised of five equations in all:Vkz+Y = y+~7kzz+Wky = VkY+Xw~+(y+z)  = (wx+y)+zx+(Vky+z) = (x+Wy)+zx+(y+Vkz)  = (x+y)+VkzWe will call a term equation resource-preserving ifeach variable occurs the same number of times onboth sides of the equality sign.
An equational spec-ification is resource-preserving if all of its memberequations are.
Note that this definition encompassesthe important cases of commutativity and associa-tivity.
On the other hand, well-known rules suchas weakening and contraction can't be modelled byresource-preserving equations.
Not only do they failto be resource-preserving i  the strict sense intro-duced here, but also they are one-way rules thatwould have to be described by means of rewrite rulesrather than equations.2.3 Resource-preserv ing logicsA resource-preserving lo ic is determined by the fol-lowing:Instantiation of the language parameters B, Z,,7 and K;t, An equational specification E over the signature{+~}iEz;Two sets of indices {ij}j?,7, {ik}~er C_ Z;t> Two sets of equational specifications {Ej}jejand {Ek}ke/c, where Et is specified over the sig-nature {+i, } (I E ,7 U K).Of course, all equational specifications occurring inthe above list are required to be resource-preserving.The operator + is intended as a generic one, whichis to be replaced by a specific connective of the lan-guage on each separate occasion.
We will write ?
* forthe equational specification obtained by substituting?
for + in E, but will drop this superscript when itis clear from the context.
(Ej)zxi will be abbreviatedas ?~j, and (?k)Vk as ?W"Henceforth, we assume that we are dealing with afixed resource-preserving lo ic ?.2.4 P roo f  sys temFor ?

Suppose we have thefollowing type assignments:John, Mary : NPloves : NP\S/NPmadly : (NP\S)\(NP\S)We would like to find type assignments o whosuch that we can derive type REL for the followingphrases:1. who John loves2.
who loves Mary3.
who John loves madlyAs is easily seen, assignment of REL/(S/NP) to whoworks for the first sentence, while REL/(N P\S) is theappropriate type to assign to who to get the secondcase right.
However, the third case can't he donein the Lambek calculus, since we have no way ofreferring to gaps occuring inside larger constituents;we only have access to the periphery.
This can behandled by adding a permutation modality VP andassigning to who the type REL/(S/VP NP) to who.This single type assignment works for all three cases.For the third sentence, this is worked out in Figure 1.As a second example, consider the following nounphrase:the man at the deskFor the nouns and the determiner we make the usualtype assignments:the : NP/Nman, desk : NFrom a prosodic point of view, at should be assignedtype (N\N)/NP.
However, semantically at combinesnot just with the noun it modifies, but with the en-tire noun phrase headed by that noun.
Moortgat &Morrill \[1992\] show how both these desiderata canbe fulfilled.
First, the type assignment to at is liftedto ((NP/(N\N))\NP)/NP in order to force the re-quired semantic ombination.
This is not the endof the story, because due to the non-associativity ofthe prosodic algebra we still can't derive a type NPfor the man at the desk.
To enable this, they add astructural modality VA to the type assignment forat to make it ((NP/VA (N\N))\NP)/NP, after whichthings work out nicely, as is shown by the derivationin Figure 2.2.6 Cut-el iminat ion and the subformulapropertyBefore turning to the semantics of/~ we will provethe Cut-elimination theorem and subformula prop-erty for it, since the latter is essential for the com-pleteness proof, and a corollary to the former.380As we remarked earlier, our proof rules areadapted from \[Venema, 1993b\].
Therefore, we canrefer the reader to that paper for most of the Cut-elimination proof.
The only notable difference be-tween both systems lies in the structural rules theyallow.
Note that resource-preservation implies thatfor any \[E(j)\]-inference we have the following two sim-ple but important properties (where the complexityof a type is defined as the number of connectives oc-curring in it):1.
Each type occurring in r occurs also in A, andvice versa;2.
The complexity of r equals that of A.Therefore, in the case of an \[C(0\]-inference, w  canalways move \[Cut\] upwards like this is done in Ve-nema's paper, and thus obtain an application of \[Cut\]of lower degree.
Hence, \[Cut\] is eliminable from ?.The subformula property says that any provablesequent has a proof in which only subformulas ofthatsequent occur.
Under the proviso that Qj is consid-ered a subtype of AiA, and QI, of wkA, the subfor-mula property follows from Cut-elimination, since ineach inference rule other than \[Cut\], the premises aremade up of subformulas of the conclusion.Let ?
.
be the logic obtained from ?
by adding aset of product connectives {*i}iez to the language,and the following inference rules to the proof system:ro iA I -A  \[ ,~L\] rFh  AFB \[.~a\]r.i A P A roi A F A*i BLike ?, the system ?,  enjoys Cut-elimination andthe subformula property.
Note that this implies thatif an ?-sequent is/:.-derivable, then it is ?-derivable.This property will be used several times in the courseof the completeness proof.Now consider a naive top-down 2 proof search strat-egy.
At every step, we have a finite choice of possi-ble applications of an inference rule, and every suchapplication either removes a connective occurence,thus diminishing the complexity of the sequent ohe proved, or rewrites the sequent's antecedent to aterm of equal complexity.
Therefore, if we make surethat a search path is relinquished whenever a sequentreappears on it (which prevents the procedure fromentering into an infinite loop), the proof search treewill be finite.
This implies that the calculus is decid-able.2.7  Semant icsThe basis for any model of ?
is a (E, C)-algebra ,4,where I\] = {+i}iex and the product operation in-terpreting oi is denoted as "i.
We say that 3 C ,4is an Fd-subalgebra of ,4 if it is closed under .~j, and2Note that we use the term top-down in the usualsense, i.e.
for a proof search procedure that works backfrom the goal to the axioms.

Theinterpretation function \[.\] is extended to arbitrarytypes and structures as follows:\[Od = ,4t (l e y u Ic)t> IB / ,A \ ]  = {c e ,4 I Va e \ [A \ ] :  c., a e \[\[3\]}> \[A\iB\] = {c E ,4 I Va e \[A\] : a "i c E \[13\]}z> EAoiB\] - -{cE,4\ [~aE\[A\ ] ,bE\[B l :c=a.+b}A sequent F k A is said to be valid with respect oa given model, if i r \ ]  g \[A\].
A sequent is gene~llyvalid if it is valid in all models.
The proof systemis said to be sound with respect o the semantics ifall derivable sequents are generally valid.
It is com-plete if the converse holds, i.e.
if all generally validsequents are derivable.2.8 Soundness  and  completenessAs usual, the soundness proof boils down to astraightforward induction on the length of a deriva-tion, and we omit it.For completeness, we start by defining the canon-ical model .A4.
Its carrier is the set S/--, where= is the equivalence relation defined by r _-- A iffVA : r F A ?~ A F A.
The ----equivalence class con-taining F will be denoted as \[r\].
On the set S/_=we define products "i (i E 27) by stipulating that\[r\] .i \[A\] = \[r oi A\].
We need to prove that thisis well-defined.
So suppose r - r ' ,  A - A' andr oi A F A.
For a structure O, let O* be the ?.-typeobtained from O by replacing each oi with oi.
Thesequent O* \[- A can be derived from O ~- A by asequence of \[.L\]-rules.
By definition of -- we knowthat r ' F" r* and A ~ }" A*.
Now, r '  ol A' I- A by thederivation below:r ol A I- A \[.L\]* r' r"r ?
oi A ?
I- A t-r' oi A" }- A \[Cut\] A' I- A"r '  ol A '  I- A \[Cut\]Evidently, .A4 = (S/=,  {.i}icz) is a (E, ~)-algebra.Next, we define ?~41 = {IF\] \[ F ~- Qz} (!
e , \ ]  u/C).It must be shown that these have the desired prop-erties.
Since it would be notationally awkward tohave to refer to an arbitrary equational specifica-tion, we do this by means of an example.
Let381rl oi# r~ ?

that VA : r ,  % F2 FA ,## r~.

This follows from the derivationin Figure 3.
The proof for A4Vk is similar.Finally, we set \[B l - { \ [ r \ ] l  r e B} for B ?B, which completes our definition of the canonicalmodel.We proceed to prove the so-called canonicallemma:LemmaIT\] = {\[r\] I r F T} for all T ?
T.P roo fWe prove this by induction on the complexity of thetype T.~, For basic types T it is true by the definition of\[.\];~, For Qt (1 ?
3" U/C) it is true by the definition ofA4a;~, For T = B/iA:1.
First, suppose \[r\] ?
~"\]\] -- ~'B/ia\].
Thenfor any \[A\] ?
\[A\] we have that \[F\]., \[A\] =\[r oi A\] ?
\[B\].
By the induction hypothesiswe deduce from this that r oi A I- B. Inparticular, since \[A\] ?
\[\[A\], we have thatr ol A I- B, whence, by \[/iR\], it follows thatr I- B/iA.2.
Conversely, suppose that r F B/iA, and let\[A\] ?
~A\].
Then, by the induction hypoth-esis, A I- A.
We now have the followingderivation:AI -A  BI -B  \[/,L\]r ~ B/,A (B/,A) o, A I- BA F A r oi A I- B \[Cut\]r oi A F B \[Cut\]From this we conclude by the induction hy-pothesis that IF oi A\] = \[r\] .i \[A\] ?

That is, \[F\] ?
\[B/IA\]I, andwe're done.For the other binary connectives, the proof issimilar.t> For T = AjA:I.
First, suppose \[r\] ?
\[AjA\] = \[A\]n A41.Then, by the induction hypothesis, r F A.Also, by the definition of A4~, I" t- Qj.Applying the \[Aj R\]-rule two these two se-quents, we find that I" I- AjA.2.
Conversely, suppose r I- AjA.
Then r I- A:A k A \[A~L1\]FFA jA  A jA  I- Ar F A \[cut\]From this we conclude by the induction hy-pothesis that \[F\] ?
\[Al.
Also, r\[&#L2\] FFA~A AjA  I- Qjr F Q~ \[Cut\]From this we find by the definition of .A4jthat \[r\] ?
\[Qj\] = .A4j.
So \[r\] ?
lA in\[Qfll = IA jA \ ] .For ~7k, the proof is similar.Now suppose that the sequent r I- A is not derivable.Then in the canonical model we have, by the lemmawe just proved, that \[r\] ?
\[\[A\].
Since IF\] ?
\[r\], thisimplies that IF\] ~ \[\[A\].
That is, r I- A is not validin the canonical model, and hence is not generallyvalid.
\[\]3 Fur ther  researchIt will not have escaped the reader's attention thatwe have failed to include the set of product con-nectives {.i}iEz in the language of the resource-preserving logics.
The reason for this is that a com-pleteness proof along the above lines runs into prob-lems for such extended logics.
This is already thecase for the full Lambek calculus.
Buszkowski \[1986\]presents a rather complicated completeness proof forthat logic.
It remains to be seen whether his ap-proach also works in the present setting.Although we've tried to give a liberal definitionof what constitutes a resource-preserving lo ic, somechoices had to be made in order to keep things man-ageable.
There is room for alternative definitions,especially concerning the interaction of the modali-ties with the different product operators.
It wouldseem to be worthwile to study some of the systemsthat have occurred in practice in detail on the basisof the ideas presented in this paper.382Finally, it is important to realize that we limitedourselves to resource-preserving lo ics in order to ob-tain relatively easy proofs of Cut-elimination anddecidability.
Since such results tend also to holdfor many systems with rules that are not resource-preserving, such as weakening and contraction, it isprobably possible to characterize a larger class ofequational theories for which these properties can beproved.
We hope to address this point on a lateroccassion.AcknowledgementsThe task of preparing this paper was alleviated con-siderably thanks to enlightening discussions with,and comments on earlier versions by Kees Ver-meulen, Yde Venema, Erik Aarts, Marco Hollenbergand Michael Moortgat.Re ferences\[Ajdukiewicz, 1935\] Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.
