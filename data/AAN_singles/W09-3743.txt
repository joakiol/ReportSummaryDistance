Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Computational Semantics, pages 355?358,Tilburg, January 2009. c?2009 International Conference on Computational SemanticsA semantic relatedness metric based on free linkstructureSander WubbenTiCCTilburg Universitys.wubben@uvt.nlAntal van den BoschTiCCTilburg Universityantal.vdnbosch@uvt.nlAbstractWhile shortest paths in WordNet are known to correlate well withsemantic similarity, an is-a hierarchy is less suited for estimating se-mantic relatedness.
We demonstrate this by comparing two free scalenetworks ( ConceptNet and Wikipedia) to WordNet.
Using the Finkelstein-353 dataset we show that a shortest path metric run on Wikipediaattains a better correlation than WordNet-based metrics.
Concept-Net attains a good correlation as well, but suffers from a low conceptcoverage.1 IntroductionIn this paper we propose a new estimate metric for semantic relatedness, byfinding the shortest path between two concepts in a semantic network.
Thesemantic networks that we exploit are the extracted free link structures ofWikipedia and the ConceptNet 3 database, a commonsense knowledgebase[3].
Various metrics of calculating semantic similarity have been developedfor WordNet [1] and applied to Wikipedia?s category graph [7].
These mea-sures tend to perform well on semantic similarity (how synonymous twowords are), but not very well on semantic relatedness (how related twowords are).2 Free-link pathfindingThe graph extracted from Wikipedia contains over 2 million nodes and 55million edges, from respectively the number of articles and the number of in-ternal links.
ConceptNet contains over 18 thousand usable concepts (nodes)355and over 254 thousand useful assertions (edges).
To find paths between con-cepts in these massive networks, they need to be indexed well and and thealgorithms need to be efficient.For the current study, the English Wikipedia dump dated 12 March2008 is downloaded1.
To form the network, only the article names andhyperlinks between the articles are extracted, constituting the link structure.ConceptNet 3 can be freely downloaded2.
Due to the database being in N3format, the links can be extracted straightforwardly.
The Porter stemmer3is used for normalization of the concepts.Because of the richness and scale of the links in these networks, whichboth can be argued to have scale free characteristics [6, 8], a breadth-firstsearch is the best option.
As we index both incoming and outgoing links,forward and backward chaining can be used simultaneously.
Therefore, wechoose to utilize a bidirectional breadth-first search algorithm.3 ExperimentsTo evaluate the task we compare our results to how humans would do giventhe same task.
Most available datasets focus on semantic similarity ratherthan semantic relatedness.
Examples of these are the Rubenstein and Good-enough and Miller and Charles wordpairs.
The Finkelstein-3534test collec-tion is a dataset that does contain semantic relatedness scores.
It contains353 wordpairs, among which the 30 wordpairs from the Miller & Charlesdataset.
The collection contains English word pairs along with human-assigned relatedness judgements.The breadth-first free-link pathfinding search algorithm is applied toboth the Wikipedia and the ConceptNet data, generating semantic relat-edness estimates for the Finkelstein pairs.
To compare our metric againstpath-based metrics based on WordNet, the WordNet::Similarity package5is used [5] on WordNet 3.0 [4].1http://download.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20080312/enwiki-20080312-pages-articles.xml.bz22http://conceptnet.media.mit.edu/conceptnet\_en\_20080605.n3.bz23http://www.ldc.usb.ve/~vdaniel/porter.pm4http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabr/resources/data/wordsim353/wordsim353.html5http://search.cpan.org/dist/WordNet-Similarity/356WordNet measures 0.18 - 0.45WikiRelate!

taken from [2]), the basic directed free-link pahfinding measure appliedon Wikipedia shows a Spearman?s ?
= 0.45, while the undirected measureshows a ?
= 0.53 with human judgements on the full Finkelstein dataset.Only the word defeating was not found in Wikipedia.In ConceptNet, 58 of the Finkelstein pairs were not found, significantlyimpairing its score: ?
= 0.35.
When we look only at those word pairsfor which a path was found, the measure applied to ConceptNet performssightly better than the directed Wikipedia measure, but worse than the morecomparable undirected Wikipedia measure: ?
= 0.47.5 DiscussionWith a correlation of 0.53 for undirected search versus 0.43 for directedsearch with the human judging scores of the Finkelstein-353 dataset, theformer appears the better suited way of exploiting the Wikipedia networkfor a semantic relatedness metric.
It also outperforms undirected search inConceptNet, which only scores a correlation of 0.35.
This lower score canbe mainly attributed to the lack of coverage of ConceptNet.
But even whenonly non-missing wordpairs are considered, ConceptNet performs worse thanWikipedia with a correlation of 0.47 with human judgements.The method introduced here outperforms any other existing pathfindingmethod for calculating semantic relatedness.
It also outperforms methodsthat makes use of WordNet?s extended gloss vectors.
This cannot be ex-plained by coverage: both in WordNet 3.0 and in the Wikipedia dump thatwas used only one wordpair was not found.
Arguably, the results show that357free link structure in conceptual networks is better suited for finding se-mantic relatedness than hierarchical structures organized along taxonomicrelations as WordNet.While ESA?s performance (?
= 0.75) is even higher, the comparisonis off.
ESA is a fully integrated machine learning architecture that makesextensive use of Wikipedia?s free text.
Our free link measure is a simpleand portable method that uses only the link structure of any given freeassociative conceptual network.
We aim to improve the method and use itin various applications, such as automated ontology building and memorybased paraphrasing.References[1] A. Budanitsky and G. Hirst.
