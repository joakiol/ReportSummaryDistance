In this study, a rule-based approach of syllable segmentationalgorithm for Myanmar text is proposed.Segmentation rules were created based onthe syllable structure of Myanmar scriptand a syllable segmentation algorithm wasdesigned based on the created rules.
Asegmentation program was developed toevaluate the algorithm.
A training corpuscontaining 32,283 Myanmar syllables wastested in the program and the experimentalresults show an accuracy rate of 99.96%for segmentation.1 IntroductionMyanmar language, also known as Burmese, is theofficial language of the Union of Myanmar.
It isspoken by 32 million as a first language, and as asecond language by ethnic minorities in Myanmar(Ethnologue, 2005).
Burmese is a member of theTibeto-Burman languages, which is a subfamily ofthe Sino-Tibetan family of languages.
Burmese is atonal and analytic language using the Burmesescript.
This is a phonologically based script,adapted from Mon, and ultimately based on an In-dian (Brahmi) prototype (Daniels and Bright,1996).
Burmese characters are rounded in shapeand the script is written from left to right.
No spaceis used between words but spaces are usually usedto separate phrases.The Myanmar language still remains as one ofthe less privileged Asian languages in cyberspace.Many people have put considerable effort into thecomputerization of the Myanmar script.
However,Myanmar still lacks support on computers and notmany NLP tools and applications are available forthis language.
A standard encoding is needed forthe language processing of Myanmar script; how-ever, there is not yet any official national standardencoding for Myanmar script.This study focuses on the syllable segmentationof Myanmar text based on the UTN11-21 encodingmodel for Myanmar script.
Myanmar script hasbeen granted space in Unicode (U+1000-U+109F)since version 3.0.
In Unicode version 4.0, the Uni-code consortium defined standards for encodingMyanmar script and canonical order.
The currentversion of Unicode is 5.0.
However, there are onlya few Unicode-compliant Myanmar fonts that fullyfollow the Unicode encoding standard.
Local fontdevelopers and implementers have produced fontsthat follow only part of the Unicode standards andmany of these partially-compliant fonts are widelyused in cyberspace.
In 2006, Myanmar proposedadditional characters2 to be added to the Unicodeversion 5.0.
The proposed characters for the Bur-mese script are as follows:?

104E MYANMAR SYMBOL AFORE-MENTIONED [Glyph change]The Unicode technical committee has acceptedthese proposed characters for inclusion in futureversions of the Unicode standard.3 If the proposalis adopted, this will become the standard encodingfor Myanmar script.
Therefore, this paper employsthe proposed encoding model for the syllable seg-mentation of Myanmar text.2 Related WorkThe lack of official standard encoding hinders lo-calization of Myanmar language and no previouswork on the syllable segmentation of Myanmarscript was found.
Although character codes forMyanmar languages have been allocated inUCS/Unicode (U+1000?U+109F), lack of imple-mentation makes them unavailable to local endusers (Ko Ko and Mikami, 2005).
We can learn,however, from related works done for other lan-guages which have similarities to Myanmar.
Manyattempts have been made in Thai language proc-essing for syllable and word segmentation.Poowarawan (1986) proposed a dictionary-basedapproach to Thai syllable separation.
Thai syllablesegmentation was considered as the first step to-wards word segmentation and many of word seg-mentation ambiguities were resolved at the level ofsyllable segmentation (Aroonmanakun, 2002).Thai syllable segmentation can be viewed as theproblem of inserting spaces between pairs of char-acters in the text and the character-level ambiguityof word segmentation can be reduced by extractingsyllables whose structures are more well-defined(Sornil and Chaiwanarom, 2004).
Most approaches3 http://www.unicode.org/alloc/Pipeline.htmlto Thai word segmentation use a dictionary as theirbasis.
However, the segmentation accuracy de-pends on the quality of the dictionary used foranalysis and unknown words can reduce the per-formance.
Theeramunkong and Usanavasin (2001)proposed a non dictionary-based approach to Thaiword segmentation.
A method based on decisiontree models was proposed and their approachclaimed to outperform some well-known diction-ary-dependent techniques of word segmentationsuch as the maximum and the longest matchingmethods.3 Myanmar AlphabetsIn order to clarify the syllable structure, charactersof the Myanmar script are classified into twelvecategories.
Each category is given a name and theglyphs and Unicode code points of characters be-longing to each category are shown in Table 1.The Myanmar script consists of a total of 75 char-acters.
There are 34 consonant letters in Conso-nants group, four medials in the Medials group andeight vowels in the Dependent Vowels group.Myanmar Sign Virama is used for stacking conso-nant letters and it does not have a glyph, whileMyanmar Sign Asat is used in devowelising proc-ess (e.g.
???).
There are three dependent varioussigns in Group F. The Group I consists of threeindependent vowels (?, ?, ?)
and three inde-pendent various signs (?, ?, ?).
The charactersin Group I can act as stand-alone syllables.
GroupE consists of four independent vowels (?, ?, ?,?)
and Myanmar Symbol Aforementioned (?
).Each of the independent vowels in group E has itsown syllable but they can also combine with othersigns to form a syllable (e.g.
?
?% ?).
MyanmarSymbol Aforementioned in Group E can neverstand alone and it is always written as ????
as ashort form of ??????????.
Myanmar Letter GreatSa is always preceded by a consonant and is neverwritten alone (e.g.
????).
There are ten Myanmardigits in the Digits group.
The group P consists oftwo Myanmar punctuation marks.
Myanmar scriptuses white space between phrases, which is takeninto account in this study.
Non-Myanmar charac-ters are not included in this study.52CategoryName Name Glyph Unicode Code PointC Consonants??????????????????????????????????

Classification of Myanmar Script4 Syllable StructureA Myanmar syllable consists of one initialconsonant, zero or more medials, zero or morevowels and optional dependent various signs.Independent vowels, independent various signs anddigits can act as stand-alone syllables.
Accordingto the Unicode standard, vowels are stored after theconsonant.
Therefore, Myanmar vowel sign E(U+1031) is stored after the consonant although itis placed before the consonant in rendering (e.g.??).
Medials may appear at most three times in asyllable (e.g.
??i?).
Vowels may appear twice in asyllable (e.g.
???).
In a syllable, a secondconsonant may come together with an Asat fordevowelising (e.g.
???).
Each of the independentvowels in group E has its own syllable but they canalso combine with other signs (consonants,dependent vowels, dependent various signs) toform a syllable (e.g.
?
?j?k, ?
?% ?, ?
?, ?l?????).
Thesyllable structure of Myanmar script can be writtenin BNF (Backus-Naur Form) as follows:Syllable ::= C{M}{V}{F} | C{M}V+A |C{M}{V}CA[F] | E[CA][F] | I | DFigure 1.
FSA for Syllable StructureA finite state machine or finite state automaton(FSA) can be employed to demonstrate the syllablestructure of Myanmar script.
A finite state machineis a model of behavior composed of a finite num-ber of states, transitions between those states, andactions.
The starting state is shown by a bold circleand double circles indicate final or acceptingstates.
The above figure shows a finite stateautomaton that can realize a Myanmar syllable.Examples of Myanmar syllables and their equiva-lent Unicode code points are shown in Table 2.53Syllable Example Unicode PointC ?

Syllable Structure with Examples5 Syllable Segmentation RulesTypically, a syllable boundary can be determinedby comparing pairs of characters to find whether abreak is possible or not between them.
However, insome cases it is not sufficient to determine a sylla-ble boundary by just comparing two characters.The following sections explain these cases andgive examples.5.1 DevowelisingIn one syllable, a consonant may appear twice butthe second consonant is used for the devowelisingprocess in conjunction with an Asat (U+103AMYANMAR SIGN ASAT).
Therefore the charac-ter after the second consonant should be furtherchecked for an Asat.
If the character after the sec-ond consonant is an Asat, there should be no sylla-ble break before the second consonant.No break???

(elephant)C  C ANo break5.2 Syllable ChainingSubjoined characters are shown by using an invisi-ble Virama sign (U+1039 MYANMAR SIGN VI-RAMA) to indicate that the following character issubjoined and should take a subjoined form.
In thiscase, if the character after the second consonant isan invisible Virama sign, there should be no sylla-ble break before the second and third consonant.Although there are two syllables in a subjoinedform, it is not possible to separate them in writtenform and they are therefore treated as one syllable.No break???

(novel)C C S  C  VNo break545.3 KinziKinzi is a special form of devowelised Nga(U+1004 MYANMAR LETTER NGA) with thefollowing letter underneath, i.e., subjoined.
In thiscase, if the character after the second consonant isan Asat and the next character after Asat is an in-visible Virama sign (U+1039 MYANMAR SIGNVIRAMA) then there should be no syllable breakbefore the second and third consonant.
Kinzi alsoconsists of two syllables but it is treated as onesyllable in written form.No break?????

(man)C  V  V   C A M V FNo break6 ImplementationSyllable segmentation rules are presented in theform of letter sequence tables (Tables 4-6).
Thetables were created by comparing each pair ofcharacter categories.
However, it is not sufficientto determine all syllable breaks by comparing onlytwo characters.
In some cases, a maximum of fourconsecutive characters need to be considered todetermine a possible syllable boundary.
Two addi-tional letter sequence tables were created for thispurpose (Tables 5 and 6).Table 4 defines the break status for each pair oftwo consecutive characters.
Table 5 and 6 definethe break status for each pair of three and four con-secutive characters, respectively.
The symbol U inthe Table 4 and 5 stands for undefined cases.
Casesundefined in Table 4 are defined in the Table 5,and those undefined in Table 5 are then defined inTable 6.The syllable segmentation program obtains thebreak status for each pair of characters by compar-ing the input character sequence with the letter se-quence tables.
The syllable break status and defini-tions are shown in Table 3.
The break status -1 in-dicates a breach of canonical spelling order and aquestion mark is appended after the ambiguouscharacter pair.
The status 0 means there should beno syllable break after the first character.
For breakcases, a syllable breaking symbol (i.e.
B in theflowchart) is inserted at each syllable boundary ofthe input string.

Syllable Break Status and Definition7 Method and ResultsA syllable segmentation program was developed toevaluate the algorithm and segmentation rules.The program accepts the Myanmar text string andshows the output string in a segmented form.
Theprogram converts the input text string into equiva-lent sequence of category form (e.g.
CMCACV for??????)
and compares the converted character se-quence with the letter sequence tables to determinesyllable boundaries.
A syllable segmented Myan-mar text string is shown as the output of the pro-gram.
The symbol "|" is used to represent the syl-lable breaking point.
In order to evaluate the accu-racy of the algorithm, a training corpus was devel-oped by extracting 11,732 headwords from Myan-mar Orthography (Myanmar Language Commis-sion, 2003).
The corpus contains a total of 32,238Myanmar syllables.
These syllables were tested inthe program and the segmented results were manu-ally checked.
The results showed 12 errors of in-correctly segmented syllables, thus achieving accu-racy of 99.96% for segmentation.
The few errorsoccur with the Myanmar Letter Great Sa ???
andthe Independent Vowel ???.
The errors can be fixedby updating the segmentation rules of these twocharacters in letter sequence tables.
Some exam-ples of input text strings and their segmented re-sults are shown in Table 7.8 ConclusionSyllables are building blocks of words and syllablesegmentation is essential for the language process-ing of Myanmar script.
In this study, a rule-basedapproach of syllable segmentation algorithm forMyanmar script is presented.
The segmentationrules were created based on the characteristics ofMyanmar syllable structure.
A segmentation pro-gram was developed to evaluate the algorithm.
Atest corpus containing 32,238 Myanmar syllableswas tested in the program and 99.96% accuracywas achieved.
From this study, we can concludethat syllable segmentation of Myanmar text can beimplemented by a rule-based approach.
Whilecharacters of non-Myanmar script are not consid-ered in this study, the segmentation rules can befurther extended to cover these characters.
A com-plete syllable segmentation algorithm for Myanmarscript can be further implemented by applying thisalgorithm.562nd CharacterA C D E F G I M P S V WA -1 U 1 1 0 -1 1 0 1 0 0 1C 0 U 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1D -1 1 0 1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1E -1 U 1 1 2 0 1 -1 1 -1 0 1F -1 U 1 1 2 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1G -1 1 1 1 0 -1 1 -1 1 -1 0 1I -1 1 1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1M 2 U 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 -1 0 1P -1 1 1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1S -1 0 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1V 2 U 1 1 0 0 1 -1 1 -1 0 11st  CharacterW -1 1 1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 0Table 4.
