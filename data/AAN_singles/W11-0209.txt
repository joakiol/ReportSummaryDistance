The develop-ment of SRL systems for the biomedical do-main is frustrated by the lack of large domain-specific corpora that are labeled with seman-tic roles.
Corpus development has been veryexpensive and time-consuming.
In this paperwe propose a method for building frame-basedcorpus on the basis of domain knowledge pro-vided by ontologies.
We believe that ontolo-gies, as a structured and semantic represen-tation of domain knowledge, can instruct andease the tasks in building the corpora.
In thepaper we present a corpus built by using themethod.
We compared it to BioFrameNet, andexamined the gaps between the semantic clas-sification of the target words in the domain-specific corpus and in FrameNet and Prop-Bank/VerbNet.1 IntroductionThe sentence-level semantic analysis of text is con-cerned with the characterization of events, such asdetermining ?who?
did ?what?
to ?whom?, ?where?,?when?
and ?how?.
It is believed to play a key rolein NLP applications such as Information Extraction,Question Answering and Summarization.
Seman-tic Role Labeling (SRL) is a process that, for eachpredicate in a sentence, indicates what semantic re-lations hold among the predicate and other sentenceconstituents that express the participants in the event(such as who and where).
The relations are de-scribed by using a list of pre-defined possible se-mantic roles for that predicate (or class of predi-cates).
Recently, large corpora have been manuallyannotated with semantic roles in FrameNet (Fill-more et al, 2001) and PropBank (Palmer et al,2005).
With the advent of resources, SRL has be-come a well-defined task with a substantial body ofwork and comparative evaluation.
Most of the workhas been trained and evaluated on newswire text (see(Ma`rquez et al, 2008)).Biomedical text considerably differs from thenewswire text, both in the style of the written textand the predicates involved.
Predicates in newswiretext are typically verbs, biomedical text often prefersnominalizations, gerunds, and relational nouns (Kil-icoglu et al, 2010).
Predicates like endocytosis, exo-cytosis and translocate, though common in biomed-ical text, are absent from both the FrameNet andPropBank data (Bethard et al, 2008).
Predicateslike block, generate and transform, have been usedin biomedical documents with different semanticsenses and require different number of semanticroles compared to FrameNet (Tan, 2010) and Prop-Bank (Wattarujeekrit et al, 2004).
The developmentof SRL systems for the biomedical domain is frus-trated by the lack of large domain-specific corporathat are labeled with semantic roles.The projects, PASBio (Wattarujeekrit etal., 2004), BioProp (Tsai et al, 2006) andBioFrameNet (Dolbey et al, 2006), have madeefforts on building PropBank-like and FrameNet-like corpora for processing biomedical text.
Upuntil recently, these corpora are relatively small.Further, no general methodology exists to sup-port domain-specific corpus construction.
Thedifficulties include, how to discover and define74semantic frames together with associated semanticroles within the domain?
how to collect and groupdomain-specific predicates to each semantic frame?and how to select example sentences from publi-cation databases, such as the PubMed/MEDLINEdatabase containing over 20 million articles?
Inthis paper, we propose that building frame-basedlexicon for the domain can be strongly instructedby domain knowledge provided by ontologies.
Webelieve that ontologies, as a structured and semanticrepresentation of domain-specific knowledge, caninstruct and ease all the above tasks.The paper proceeds as follows: first we explainour method how ontological domain knowledge in-structs the main tasks in building a frame-based lexi-con.
This is followed by the related work.
In section4, we present a ?study case?
of the method.
We builta frame Protein Transport containing text annotatedwith semantic roles.
The construction is carriedout completely under the supervision of the domainknowledge from the Gene Ontology (GO) (Ash-burner et al, 2000).
We evaluated it to the frameProtein transport in the BioFrameNet and examinedthe gaps between the semantic classification of thetarget words in the domain-specific corpus and inFrameNet and PropBank/VerbNet.
Finally, we con-clude our work.2 The MethodThe FrameNet project is the application of the the-ory of Frames Semantics (Fillmore et al, 1985) incomputational lexicography.
Frame semantics be-gins with the assumption that in order to understandthe meanings of the words in a language, we mustfirst have knowledge of the background and moti-vation for their existence in the language and fortheir use in discourse.
The knowledge is providedby the conceptual structures, or semantic frames.
InFrameNet, a semantic frame describes an event, asituation or a object, together with the participants(called frame elements (FE)) involved in it.
A wordevokes the frame, when its sense is based on theframe.
The relations between frames include is-a,using and subframe.Ontology is a formal representation of knowledgeof a domain of interest.
It has concepts that representsets or classes of entities within a domain.
It definesdifferent types of relations among concepts.
Intu-itively, ontological concepts and their relations canbe used as the frame-semantic descriptions imposedon a lexicon.A large number of ontologies have been devel-oped in the domain of biomedicine.
Many of themcontain concepts that comprehensively describe acertain domain of interest, such as GO.
GO bi-ological process ontology, containing 20,368 con-cepts, provides the structured knowledge of biolog-ical processes that are recognized series of eventsor molecular functions.
For example, the con-cept GO:0015031 protein transport defines the sce-nario, ?the directed movement of proteins into,out of or within a cell, or between cells, bymeans of some agent such as a transporter orpore?.
It is a subclass of GO:0006810:transport andGO:0045184:establishment of protein localization.The class has 177 descendant classes in is-a hierar-chies.
A Protein Transport frame can be effectivelydescribed by using these classes and relations be-tween them.In many cases ontological terms can be seenas phrases that exhibit underlying compositionalstructures (McCray et al, 2002; Ogren et al,2005).
Figure 1 presents the compositionalstructures of 9 direct subclasses describing var-ious types of protein transport.
They pro-vide that translocation, import, recycling,secretion and transport are the possible pred-icates, evoking the protein transport event.
Themore complex expressions, e.g.
translocation ofpeptides or proteins into other organism involvedin symbiotic interaction (GO:0051808), express par-ticipants involved in the event, i.e.
the en-tity (peptides or proteins), destination (intoother organism) and condition (involved insymbiotic interaction) of the event.So far, we, using these classes and relations be-tween them, have partly defined the semantic frameProtein Transport, decided the participants involvedin the event, and listed the domain-specific wordsevoking the frame.
The complete frame descriptioncan be given after studying all the related classesand their relations.
Lastly, collecting example sen-tences will be based on knowledge based searchengine for biomedical text, like GoPubMed (Domsand Schroeder, 2005).
As such, domain knowledge75Figure 1: A concise view of 9 GO terms describing Protein Transport.
We use the modified finite state automaton(FSA) representation given in (Ogren et al, 2005).
Any path that begins at a start state, represented by double solidborders, and ends in an end state, represented by a single solid border, corresponds to a term.
The nodes with a dashedborder are neither start states nor end states.provided by ontologies, such as GO biological pro-cess ontology and molecular function ontology, andpathway ontologies, can instruct us in building largeframe-based corpora for the domain.We outline the aspects of how ontologies instructbuilding a frame-based corpus:1.
The structure and semantics of domain knowl-edge in ontologies constrain the frame seman-tics analysis, i.e.
decide the coverage of seman-tic frames and the relations between them;2.
Ontological terms can comprehensively de-scribe the characteristics of events/scenarios inthe domain, so domain-specific semantic rolescan be determined based on terms;3.
Ontological terms provide a list of domain-specific predicates, so the semantic senses ofthe predicates in the domain are determined;4.
The collection and selection of example sen-tences can be based on knowledge-based searchengine for biomedical text.3 Related WorkThe PropBank project is to add a semantic layer onthe Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1994).
For eachunique verb sense, a set of semantic roles is de-fined at its accompanying syntactic realizations.
TheVerbNet project (Kipper et al, 2000) systematicallycreates English verb entries in a lexicon with syntac-tic and semantic information, referring to Levin verbclasses.
It made efforts to classify individual verbsin PropBank into VerbNet classes, based on patternsof usage (Kingsbury and Kipper, 2003).The FrameNet project collects and analyzes thecorpus (the British National Corpus) attestations oftarget words with semantic overlapping.
The attes-tations are divided into semantic groups, noting es-pecially the semantic roles of each target words, andthen these small groups are combined into frames.Ontologies have been put under the spotlight forproviding the framework for semantic representa-tion of textual information, and thus a basis for textmining systems (Spasic et al, 2005; Ashburner etal., 2008).
Up to recently, TM systems mainly useontologies as terminologies to recognize biomedicalterms, by mapping terms occurring in text to con-cepts in ontologies, or use ontologies to guide andconstrain analysis of NLP results, by populating on-tologies.
In the latter case, ontologies are more ac-tively used as a structured and semantic representa-tion of domain knowledge.The FrameNet project links Semantic Types (ST)of FrameNet to the Suggested Upper Merged Ontol-ogy (SUMO) classes (Scheffczyk et al, 2006).
Themain function of ST is to indicate the basic typingof fillers of semantic roles, e.g.
?Sentient?
definedfor the semantic role ?Cognizer?
in the frame ?Cog-itation?.
The goal of the work is to combine framesemantics in FrameNet and the formal world knowl-edge from SUMO, for improving FrameNet capabil-ity for deductive reasoning.BioFrameNet is a domain-specific FrameNet ex-tension.
Its intracellular protein transport framesare mapped to the Hunter Lab 1 knowledge base(HLKB) protein transport classes.
The frame ele-ments are taken from HLKB slots.
BioFrameNet1Website for Hunters Bioinformatics research lab: http://compbio.uchsc.edu/.76considered a collection of Gene References in Func-tion (GRIF) texts that are annotated by the HLKBprotein transport classes in the knowledge base.Predicates are extracted from this collection of GRIFtexts.PASBio and BioProp are the projects that aim toproduce definitions of Predicate Argument Structure(PAS) frames.
They do not offer a direct linkingof the predicates or their arguments to domain orgeneral ontologies.
PASBio used a model for a hy-pothetical signal transduction pathway of an ideal-ized cell, to motivate verb choices.
BioProp anno-tated the arguments of 30 frequent biomedical verbsfound in the GENIA corpus (Kim et al, 2003).4 Case Study: Protein Transport FrameIn this section we present the frame Protein Trans-port.
The frame is built completely based on the do-main knowledge provided by the piece of GO de-scribing the event.
The core structure of the frame isthe same as that of FrameNet.
The description of thescenario evoked by the frame is provided, along witha list of the frame elements and their definitions.
Alist of lexical units (LUs) that evoke the frame is pro-vided.
In addition, example sentences that containat least one of the LUs, are given annotations us-ing definitions of the frame.
The annotations followFrameNet?s guidelines for lexicographic annotation,described in (Ruppenhofer et al, 2005).4.1 The FrameResources.
The description of the frame uses thescenario defined in GO:0015031 protein transportfrom the GO biological process ontology.
It is a sub-class of GO:0006810 transport and GO:0045184 es-tablishment of protein localization.
The class has 177descendant classes.
A total of 581 class names andsynonyms are collected for the study.
In addition tothat from GO concepts, synonyms are also gatheredby querying the UMLS Metathesaurus (Schuyler etal., 1992).Frame.
The definition (see Table 1) follows thedefinition of GO:0015031 protein transport.Frame Elements.
By studying all the names andsynonyms (we call them ?term?
in the paper), wedefined all possible FEs for the frame (see Table 2).The first 4 FEs are considered as core FEs.
Ta-?This frame deals with the cellular process inwhich a protein or protein-complex, the Trans-port Entity, moves from the Transport Origin toa different location, the Transport Destination.Sometimes the Transport Origin and Trans-port Destination are not specified or are the samelocation.
The Transport Entity undergoes di-rected movement into, out of or within a cell orbetween cells or within a multicellular organism.This activity could be aided or impeded by othersubstances, organelles or processes and could in-fluence other cellular processes.
?Table 1: The frame definition.ble 3 gives the number of the GO terms that indi-cate the FEs.
For instance, in the term GO:003295B cell receptor transport within lipid bilayer, lipidbilayer is the location within which proteintransport happens.
The term GO:0072322 proteintransport across periplasmic space describes thepath along which protein transport occurs.
Theterm GO:0043953 protein transport by the Tat com-plex specifies a molecule that carries protein dur-ing the movement.
GO:0030970 retrograde pro-tein transport, ER to cytosol indicates the direc-tion (retrograde) of the movement.
An attribute(SRP-independent) of the event is described inthe term GO:0006620 SRP-independent protein-membrane targeting ER.Predicates.
All lexical units in the frame arelisted in Table 4.
The first row gives the head ofthe GO terms (noun phrases).
The number in thebracket indicates the number of GO terms with thehead.
If the verb derived from a head, can be usedto describe the event that is expressed by the head,it is also included as a LU.
GO terms, such as re-lated and broader synonyms, may be not consid-ered for collecting predicates.
For example, fat bodymetabolism, a broad synonym of GO:0015032 stor-age protein import into fat body, is not considered.Example Sentences.
The example sentences areretrieved from the PubMed/MEDLINE database byusing the GoPubMed (Doms and Schroeder, 2005),a knowledge-based search engine for biomedicaltext.
The sentences to be annotated, are always themost relevant and from the latest publications.

The querystarts from using the most general GO terms.
In thecase that the number of query results is huge, morespecific terms are used instead.
Minimally, 10 sen-tences are gathered for each LU, if applicable.
Incases when only specific GO terms are available andthe number of query results is too small, we gener-alize the query term.
For example, the lexical units,release.n and release.v, are derived and onlyderived from GO:0002001 renin secretion into bloodstream?s synonym renin release into blood stream.No query result returns for the GO term.
The gen-eral term ?protein release?
is used as the query terminstead.Table 5 shows an example sentence for the frame.For each sentence annotated, we mark the target LU,and collect and record syntactic and semantic infor-mation about the relevant frame?s FEs.
For eachFE, three types of annotation are gathered.
The firstlayer is the identity of the specific FE.
In cases whenthe FE is explicitly realized, phrase type (PT, for ex-ample NP) and grammatical function (GF) of the re-alization are annotated.
The GFs describe the waysin which the constituents satisfy abstract grammati-cal requirements of the target word.
In cases whenthe FE is omitted, the type of its null instantiation isrecorded.
These three layers for all of the annotatedsentences, along with complete frame and FE de-scriptions are used in summarizing valence patternsfor each annotated LU.4.2 Evaluation4.2.1 Compared to BioFrameNetWe compared this frame to the frame Pro-tein transport in BioFrameNet 2.
The frame in-volves the phenomenon of intracellular proteintransport.
BioFrameNet considered a collection ofGRIF texts that describe various types of intracellu-lar protein transport phenomena.
The GRIFs textsare annotated by HLKB protein transport classes.All the 5 HLKB protein transport classes are ar-ranged in is-a hierarchy.
The description of the toplevel class protein transport is taken from the defini-tion of GO:0015031 protein transport which is a su-2http://dolbey.us/BioFN/BioFN.zip (28-Mar-2009)perclass of GO:0006886 intracellular protein trans-port in GO.
For the frame, BioFrameNet providesdefinitions for 4 FEs, including Transported entity,Transport origin, Transport destination and Trans-port locations.
The proposed FEs are taken fromthe slot definitions in the HLKB classes.Table 6 illustrates the difference between theLUs in the 2 frames.
The LUs that are notincluded in our corpus, can be classified intotwo groups.
The first group include the LUsenter.v, redistribution.n, return.v, andtraffic.n.
They or their nominals are absent fromGO biological process ontology terms.
The secondgroup includes those appear in GO, but in the termsthat are not included in descendants of GO:0015031protein transport.The LUs, endocytosis.n, internaliza-tion.n, recruitment.n, do not appear in thedescendants of GO:0015031 protein transport, butappear in GO terms that indeed describe proteintransport event.
endocytosis is the head of 9GO terms, among which 2 concepts indeed describean endocytotic process of protein (e.g.GO:0070086ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis).
3 GO terms haveinternalization as the head.
They all de-scribe protein transport event (e.g.
GO:0031623 re-ceptor internalization).
recruitment.n occurs inGO:0046799 recruitment of helicase-primase com-plex to DNA lesions and GO:0046799 recruitmentof 3?-end processing factors to RNA polymerase IIholoenzyme complex, which describe the movementof protein complex to another macro molecule.The LUs, efflux.n, entry.n, exo-cytosis.n, migrate.n, mobilization.n,move.v, movement.n, shuttle.n andshuttling.v, appear in GO terms that aredescendants of GO:0006810 transport.
They areused to describe various kinds of transport eventsthat protein is not involved in.shift.n only occurs in GO:0003049 regula-tion of systemic arterial blood pressure by capillaryfluid shift.
capillary fluid shift describesa kind of transport event.

The PT andGF layers and the number of times they occur aregiven in the last columns, in the format of PT GF(number of occurrences).
There are differences be-tween the valence patterns of two corpus.
We no-tice that example sentences in BioFrameNet mainlydescribe about protein.
Although protein transportis described, different topics may be covered in thesentences in our corpus.4.2.2 Predicates in FrameNet andPropBank/VerbNetWe examined the gaps between the semantic clas-sification of the LUs (or only verbs) in the frame,and in FrameNet and PropBank/VerbNet.
Aroundhalf of the LUs from the frame are absent fromFrameNet data.
5 LUs are used in describing proteintransport event, with the same semantic sense as inFrameNet.
We identified the FEs for Protein Trans-port frame based on the domain knowledge.

Other LUs are used withdifferent semantic senses.Except translocate, all verbs are included inPropBank data.
Half of the verb senses have beenclassified into VerbNet classes.
Only 3 verbs areused with the same sense as in describing proteintransport event.5 ConclusionIn this paper we propose a method for buildingframe-based corpus for the domain of biomedicine.The corpus construction relies on domain knowl-edge provided by ontologies.
We believe that onto-logical domain knowledge can instruct us and easethe tasks in building the corpora.
We built a cor-pus for transport event completely on basis of thepiece of domain knowledge provided by GO bio-verbs VerbNet PropBanktranslocate - -deliver,transportsend-11.1 with the samesemantic sensesecrete -exit escape-51.1 with differentrelease free-80.1 semantic sensesort classify-29.10target confront-98export,import,localize,recycle-Table 10: Verbs in PropBank/VerbNetlogical process ontology 3.
We compared the frameProtein Transport to the frame Protein transport inBioFrameNet, and examined the gaps between thesemantic classification of the target words in thedomain-specific corpus and in FrameNet and Prop-Bank/VerbNet.In the future, we aim to extend the corpus to coverother biological events.
GO ontologies will be themain resource to provide domain knowledge, butalso other ontologies, such as pathway ontologieswill be considered as important domain knowledgeresources.
The identification of frames and the rela-tions between frames are needed to be investigated.In addition, we will study the definition of STs in thedomain corpus and their mappings to classes in topdomain ontologies, such as BioTop (Bei?wanger etal., 2008).AcknowledgementWe acknowledge the financial support of the Centerfor Industrial Information Technology (CENIIT)and the foundation Stiftelsen Olle EngkvistByggma?stare.ReferencesMichael Ashburner, Catherine A.
