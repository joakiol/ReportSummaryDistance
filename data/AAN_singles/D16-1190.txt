While detecting reuse in con-temporary languages is well supported?givenextensive research, techniques, and corpora?automatically detecting historical text reuse ismuch more difficult.
Corpora of historical lan-guages are less documented and often encom-pass various genres, linguistic varieties, andtopics.
In fact, historical text reuse detection ismuch less understood and empirical studies arenecessary to enable and improve its automation.We present a linguistic analysis of text reuse intwo ancient data sets.
We contribute an auto-mated approach to analyze how an original textwas transformed into its reuse, taking linguis-tic resources into account to understand howthey help characterizing the transformation.
Itis complemented by a manual analysis of asubset of the reuse.
Our results show the limi-tations of approaches focusing on literal reusedetection.
Yet, linguistic resources can effec-tively support understanding the non-literal textreuse transformation process.
Our results sup-port practitioners and researchers working onunderstanding and detecting historical reuse.1 IntroductionThe computational detection of historical text reuse?including citations, quotations or allusions ?canbe applied in many respects.
It can help tracingdown historical content (a.k.a., lines of transmis-sion), which is essential to the field of textual crit-icism (Bu?chler et al, 2012).
In the context of mas-sive digitization projects, it can identify relationshipsbetween text excerpts referring to the same source.Specifically, detecting copies of the same historicaltext that have diverged over time (manuscript studies,a.k.a., Stemma Codicum) is an important task.Although much work exists in the field of nat-ural language processing (NLP), many new chal-lenges arise when processing historical text.
Themost important challenges are the absence of support-ing tools and methods, including an agreement ona common orthography, standardization of variants,and a wide range of clean, digitized text (Piotrowski,2012; Geyken and Gloning, 2014; Zitouni, 2014).Typical statistical approaches from the field of NLPare difficult to apply to historically transferred texts,since these often cover a large timespan and, thus,comprise many different writing styles, text variantsor even reuse styles (Bu?chler, 2013).
Our long-termgoal is to conceive robust text reuse detection tech-niques for historical texts.
To this end, we need toimprove the quantitative empirical understanding ofsuch reuse accompanied by qualitative empirical stud-ies.
However, only few such works exist.We study less- and non-literal text reuse of Bibleverses in Ancient Greek and Latin texts.
Our focus ison understanding how the reuse instances are trans-formed from the original verses.
We identify opera-tions that characterize how words are changed?e.g.,synonymized, capitalized or part-of-speech (PoS) in-formation changed.
Since our approach uses externallinguistic resources, including Ancient Greek Word-Net (AGWN) (Bizzoni et al, 2014; Minozzi, 2009)and various lemma lists, we also show how suchresources can help detecting reuse and where the lim-itations are.
We complement the automated approach1849with a qualitative manual analysis.
We contribute:?
an automated approach to characterize how textis transformed between reuse and original,?
an application of the approach to two textdatasets where reuse was manually identified,?
empirical data based on the automated approach,complemented by a manual identification.Our resulting datasets1 with rich information aboutthe reuse transformation (e.g., PoS and morphologychanges, and words becoming synonyms or hyper-onyms, among others) can be used as a benchmark forfuture reuse detection and classification approaches.2 Related WorkWe first discuss why existing reuse detection ap-proaches are not applicable to historical texts, andthen present works trying to address this problem.Historical Text Reuse and Plagiarism Detection.Bu?chler (2013) combines state-of-the-art NLP tech-niques to address reuse detection scenarios for histor-ical texts, ranging from near copies to text excerptswith a minimum overlap.
He uses the commonly usedmethod fingerprinting, which selects n-grams froman upfront pre-segmentized corpus.
While his ap-proach can discover historical and modern text reuselanguage-independently, it requires a minimum textsimilarity?typically at least two common features.Recognizing modified reuse is difficult in general.Alzahrani et al (2012) study plagiarism detectiontechniques: n-gram-, syntax-, and semantics-basedapproaches.
As soon as reused text is slightly modi-fied (e.g., words changed) most systems fail.
Barro?n-Ceden?o et al (2013) conduct experiments on para-phrasing, observing that complex paraphrasing alongwith a high paraphrasing density challenges plagia-rism detection, and that lexical substitution is themost frequent technique for plagiarizing.
The Ara-PlagDet (Bensalem et al, 2015) initiative focuseson the evaluation of plagiarism detection methodsfor Arabic texts.
Eight methods were submitted andturned out to work with a high accuracy on exter-nal plagiarism detection but did not achieve usableresults for intrinsic plagiarism detection.Corpora.
Huge parallel corpora of modern lan-guages are used in fields such as paraphrase gen-1https://bitbucket.org/mariamoritz/emnlperation and detection, typically used to train statis-tical models (Zhao et al, 2009; Madnani and Dorr,2010).
However, such corpora hardly exist for his-torical languages or are copyrighted, such as theTLG digital library (Pantelia, 2014).
Especially inthe field of modern reuse investigation, aligned cor-pora are often used, providing a rich source of para-phrasal sentence pairs in one, sometimes multiplelanguages.
One of such is the Microsoft ResearchParaphrase Corpus (MSRP), which contains 5801manually evaluated, paraphrasal sentence pairs in En-glish (Dolan and Brockett, 2005).
Ganitkevitch etal.
(2013) present a paraphrase database with over200 million English paraphrase pairs and 196 millionSpanish paraphrases.
Each paraphrase pair comeswith measures, such as a paraphrase probability score.In ancient literature, efforts are made to collect Bib-lical reuse.
One of such is the collection of AncinetGreek and Latin quotations based on the the VetusLatina series and the Novum Testamentum GraecumEditio Critica Maior (Houghton, 2013a; Houghton,2013b).
It contains more than 150,000 Latin citationsand about 87,000 Ancient Greek Bible references.Historical Text Processing in General.
Effortsto automatically process ancient texts are madearound the Perseus Digital Library project (Crane,1985), among others.
For example, Bamman (2008)presents the discovery of textual allusions in a col-lection of Classical poetry, using measures such astoken similarity, n-grams or syntactic similarity.
Thisallows finding at least the most similar candidateswithin a closed library.
Some works have focused ontext reuse in Biblical Greek text.
Lee (2007) investi-gate reuse among the Gospels of the New Testament,aimed at aligning similar sentences.
Using sourcealternation patterns, among others, the approach usescosine similarity, source verse proximity, and sourceverse order.
Focusing on high recall, the detection ofHomeric quotations in Athenaeus?
Deipnosophistai?was investigated by Bu?chler et al (2012), searchingfor distinctive words within reuse.While the approaches above rely on string or fea-ture similarity, Bamman (2011b) attempts to processthe semantic space using word-sense disambigua-tion (Patwardhan et al, 2003; Agirre and Edmonds,2007).
Using a bilingual sense inventory and trainingset, they classify up to 72 % of word senses correctly.Utilizing Linguistic Resources.
Word nets support1850identifying word relationships.
Jing (1998) investi-gates issues that come with using WordNet (Milleret al, 1990) for language generation.
Among others,these comprise issues arising from the adaption of ageneral lexicon to a specific domain.
These were en-countered by using a domain corpus and an ontologyto prune WordNet to a certain domain.In our work, we are interested in using linguisticresources (word nets and lemma lists) together withPoS information to model the transformation processof reuse, specifically on an ancient language text tofind limitations when applied to non-literal text reuse.3 MethodologyOur study addresses two main research questions:RQ1.
What is the extent of non-literal reuse in ourdatasets?
This analysis provides a baseline for thefollowing characterizations of the non-literal reuse.RQ2.
How is the non-literally reused text modifiedin our datasets?
We study kinds and frequencies ofsemantic, lexical, and morphological changes.
Wedevelop an automated approach to identify the reusetransformation, and complement it with a manual,qualitative analysis.
We formulate two sub-questions:RQ2.1.
How can linguistic resources support thediscovery of non-literal reuse?
We conjecture thatnon-literal reuse is difficult to capture automatically(especially due to domain- or author-specific words),but that taking linguistic resources into account helps.We analyze the coverage of words in lemma lists anda synset database, and investigate how useful theyare for understanding the reuse transformations.RQ2.2.
What are the limitations of an automatedclassification approach relying on linguistic re-sources?
Our manual analysis investigates the reusein its full richness, to understand the limitations ofthe automated approach and identify further charac-teristics of the reuse in our datasets.3.1 Study DesignOur study comprises the following main steps.
First(RQ1), we identify and characterize the literal andnon-literal overlap in reuse instances.
Second (to-wards RQ2), we define operations reflecting literalreuse, replacements (inspired by semantic relation-ships, such as synonyms and hyperonyms, supportedby AGWN), and morphological changes (e.g., whenmapping words contain the same cognate).
Our oper-ations are based on a one-word-replacement to betterquantify the results.
Third (RQ2.1), we develop analgorithm that identifies operations by first lookingfor morphological changes between a word from thereuse and its corresponding candidate from the Bibleverse and, in case of no success, by seeking for asemantic relation.
We apply it to our two datasetsand investigate the relationships of affected wordsand the literal share.
We quantify occurrences of op-erations and calculate two measures suplem (lemmasupport) and supAGWN (AGWN support) to assessthe resources?
coverage for our approach.
Fourth(RQ2.2), we manually analyze a smaller sample ofour reuse datasets, using further operations, to under-stand the full richness of the reuse.3.2 DatasetsWe use the following two text sources, both reusingcontent from Bible verses.
As a ground truth of thereuse, we use manually annotated versions of both,provided to us by Mellerin (2014) and the Biblindexproject (Mellerin, 2016; Vinzent et al, 2013).Our first dataset comes from the primary sourcetext of ?Salvation for the Rich?
from the An-cient Greek writer Clement of Alexandria (Cle?mentd?Alexandrie, 2011), a well-known author in Bibli-cal literature (Cosaert, 2008).
The Biblindex teamannotated 128 text passages as Bible reuse instances,adding a footnote with Bible verse pointers to each.We select a total of 95 out of these 128, followingfour criteria: (i) reuse should not consist of an exactliteral copy of a Bible verse (skipping six instances),(ii) reuse should be recognizable by our expert (skip-ping ten instances), (iii) the reference frame shouldbe within five Bible verses (comparable with sen-tences) to avoid too much noise in our data to ensurea comparable length to the original Bible verse (skip-ping nine instances), and (iv) reuse instances shouldnot exceed a length of 40 tokens (1?2 sentences),again to cut the long tail and avoid too much noise(skipping eight instances).
Sometimes one reuse in-stance pointed to different Bible verses or one textpassage contained more than one reuse instance, thus,we come up with 199 verse-reuse-pairs.
The excerptspoint to a total of 15 Bible books.Our second dataset are extracts from a total of14 volumes of twelve works and two work collec-1851Jer 23 24 si occultabitur vir in absconditis et ego non videbo eum dicit Dominus numquid non caelum et terram ego impleo ait Dominus (Can anyone hide himself in secret places that I will not see him?

Specifi-cally, since those reuse instances come from severaldifferent primary source works, they point to a to-tal of 31 Bible books.
We use the Bible editionsfrom Biblindex, specifically, the data based on Septu-agint (Rahlfs, 1935b), Greek New testament (Alandand Aland, 1966), and Biblia sacra juxta vulgatamversionem (Weber R., 1969 1994 2007).Fig.
1 shows reuse examples, illustrating the widerange of literalness in our data, comprising literal (alltokens overlap), less literal (important tokens over-lap), and non-literal (no content word tokens overlap)reuse.
For example, Clement?s reuse ranges from in-troducing the overall topic by citing multiple verses,to supporting his argumentation.
Specifically, Mk10 30 is a fully literal reuse from a passage that dis-cusses the problem of rich men in heaven.
Clementuses this episode as a main point in his essay.
Laterhe refers to 1Cor 13 13, he again refers to how hardit would be for rich men to enter heaven, explainingthat salvation is independent of ?external things,?

We introduce b to represent theLatin ablative case, which does not exist in Greek.3.4 Automated ApproachOur approach is to model the transformation processin terms of parameterized operations applied to thewords in the reuse instance in order to obtain theoriginal words.
These operations use linguistic re-sources, such as lemma lists of classical Greek andBiblical Koine, and a synset database.
For each trans-formation, we create the set of operations necessaryto transform the reuse instance to its original.Linguistic Resources.
We investigate the followinglemma lists to look up lemmatized forms of words?aprerequisite for looking up synsets: Classical Lan-guage Tool Kit (CLTK) (Johnson et al, 2014 2016)provides Ancient Greek and Latin lemma lists for953,907 Greek and 270,228 Latin words.

Table 1 shows the coverage of each re-source for our datasets.
In the lower part of it wemerge all lemma resources into one set of word-lemma pairs.
The table shows that CLTK coversthe Bible data better than the Hellenistic Greek asused in Clement of Alexandria, an author from 2ndcentury AD, writing in an archaic style with Biblicalvocabulary, while also being influenced by Classi-cal Greek.
We also check the coverage of lemmatastemming from the same source (Biblindex) as ourreuse.
To increase the coverage for Greek, we consultSBLGNT&LXX, which in fact increases it.
To notmiss important information, we integrate all of theresources?
data into our approach.
For every lemmaof a word we check the semantic relations in AGWN.We experimented with different ways of looking uplemmas and found that lower-casing all Latin tokensimproved the success.
For Greek, it had the oppositeeffect, which indicates that the Greek text containsmore entities that are not available in lowercase inthe lemma lists, so we did not change in that case.5Operations and Classification.
We define replace-ment operations using words and PoS as parame-ters, to transform a reuse instance back into theBible verse it originates from.
Table 2 lists the op-erations for the computational approach.
We in-troduce the operations NOPmorph, repl pos, andrepl case for words having the same cognate, andlemma missing(reuse word) when a word is not4CATSS LXX is prepared by the Thesaurus Linguae Grae-cae project directed by T.

Thereafter, we look up the lemma and re-turn lem if the lemma of the reused word matchesthe lemma of the original.
For these four, we alsocheck the morphology, in addition returning whetherthe original has the same PoS and case (NOPmorph)or whether PoS changed (repl pos), case changed(repl case), or both.
So up to three operations can bereturned per word.
Finally, we check for synonyms(repl syn), hyperonyms (hyper), hyponyms (hypo),and co-hyponyms (repl co-hypo), but do not checkmorphology.
If a Bible verse word is used as a match,it is not used again for any other word from the reuse.3.5 Qualitative ApproachTo obtain a deeper understanding of the limitations oflinguistic resources for our purpose, two graduate stu-dents (one Latinist, one Classical Archeologist) man-ually analyze 100 Greek and 60 Latin reuse instanceswith their expert knowledge, using an extended setof operations.

4.4.4.1 Literal Share of the Reuse (RQ1)We obtain a first understanding of the reuse by look-ing at the percentage of overlapping words betweenreuse instance and original Bible verse.
We measurethe longest common substring based on word tokens.Fig.

In our Latin dataset, the overlap is sig-nificantly higher than in the Greek dataset Sec.

3.2.For a more precise understanding of the literalness,we group operations into literal (NOP, upper, lower,lem), non-literal (repl syn, repl hyper, repl hypo,repl co-hypo), and unclassified (no rel found andlemma missing).
Within each reuse instance, we cal-culate their relative occurrence using the results ofthe automated approach (explained shortly).
Fig.

It confirms Fig.
2 by show-ing a higher rate of literalness for Latin compared toGreek.
In summary, it also shows that the Latin reusecan be better classified by our approach, which takesthe lemma lists and AGWN into account.4.2 Automated Approach (RQ2.1)Table 3 shows the total number of operations identi-fied for the transformation from reuse instances tothe Greek and Latin originals.
For 987 (45 %) out of2189 words in the Greek instances and for 893 (67 %)out of 1335 words in the Latin instances, we wereable to identify at least one operation, which alreadyindicates to what extent the resources are helpful.Fig.

Weonly encounter a frequent use of upper at the firstposition in Latin, which means that Bernard oftenstarts his Biblical references with literal Bible words.After having checked the overall coverage of thelinguistic resources for all tokens (cf.
Sec.
3.4),we now specifically investigate to what extent theresources support identifying the reuse transforma-tion for the non-literal reuse using our approach.We introduce the measures suplem and supAGWNto calculate how often looking up a lemma orsubsequently a synset element was successful.This is easy based on our operations.
Let Occ(o)be the number of occurrences of an operationo, obtained from Table 3.
The operations thatsuccessfully looked up a lemma (before consultingAGWN) are lem success={lem, syn, repl hyper,repl hypo, repl co-hypo, no rel found}.
Now recallthat lem missing represents the case when a reusetoken was not found in the lemma resources.
Thensuplem =?Occ(o) o?lem success?Occ(o) o?lem success?
{lem missing} .
We obtaina suplem of 0.65 for the Greek reuse and 0.88 for theLatin reuse.
Similarly, the operations that success-fully looked up from AGWN are agwn success={syn,1855operation Greek Latin operation Greek Latinrepl syn 78 (40.6%) 91 (40.4%) repl gender 6 (3.1%) 1 (0.4%)repl ant 1 (0.5%) 0 repl mood 11 (5.7%) 12 (5.3%)repl hyper 3 (1.6%) 0 repl number 17 (8.9%) 17 (7.6%)repl hypo 11 (5.7%) 0 repl person 5 (2.6%) 14 (6.2%)lem 1 (0.5%) 2 (0.9%) repl pos 18 (9.4%) 33 (14.7%)repl co-hypo 0 1 (0.4%) repl tense 3 (1.6%) 9 (4.0%)repl case 38 (19.8%) 36 (16%) repl voice 0 8 (3.6%)Table 4: Numbers of replacement operations identi-fied for the manual reuse transformation.repl hyper, repl hypo, repl co-hypo}, withno rel found representing a failed lookup.
Then:supAGWN =?Occ(o) o?agwn success?Occ(o) o?agwn success?
{no rel found} .
Weobtain supAGWN of 0.34 for Greek and 0.33 for Latin.These values can be interpreted as follows.
Thelemma resources for genre- and time-specific textwork well for less-literal reuse, but the resources forsemantic relationships (synset databases) show a lackof support and need further development.4.3 Qualitative Approach (RQ2.2)We manually identify the transformation operationsfor 60 reuse instances of the Ancient Greek data andfor 100 of the Latin data.
Here, NOPs cover 9.3 %,insertions 49.8 %, and deletions cover 30.5 % in theGreek data.
NOPs cover 26.1 %, insertions 49.7 %,and deletions 11.9 % in the Latin data.Table 4 shows the ratios of the various repl oper-ations based on the remaining 10.4 % and 12.2 %.Similar to the automated approach, we observe astrong use of synonyms and other semantic-level op-erations, and also a certain portion of switching mor-phological categories, which indicates para-phrasalreuse.
In the Greek data, PoS changes cover about9%, out of which a participle became a verb (7 times)and vice-versa (5 times).
In our Latin data, PoSchanges represent 15% of replacements: often a pro-noun changed to a noun (6 times) and a participlebecame a verb (12 times).
Case changes are shownin Table 5.
Significantly often, an ablative becamean accusative, because often changing prepositionsexpect different cases, or an accusative was replacedby an ablative or nominative, because para-phrasalexpression changed.We encounter exceptions that prevent applying theoperations.
In the Greek data, one word is replacedoperation Greek Latin operation Greek Latinrepl case a b 0 6 repl case g a 5 2repl case a n 9 4 repl case g n 4 2repl case b a 0 10 repl case n a 7 5repl case d a 0 2 repl case n d 3 0repl case d g 3 0 repl case v g 0 2repl case d n 5 0Table 5: Numbers of case replacementswith its antonym6; once, a synonym also changes itsPoS.
Four times, more than one morphological cate-gory changes, twice an auxiliary is deleted, and fivetimes inserted.
We find one writing variance (lem),and three times a synonym is replaced by a multi-word expression.
In the Latin data, in 16 cases asynonym is replaced and morphological informationchanged.
Seven times, more than one morphologicalparameter changes for the same cognate.
Eight times,an auxiliary is inserted or deleted, and twice, a writ-ing variance is encountered.
A synonym is replacedby more than one word five times.
In one case, areuse is too paraphrasal for any word to match se-mantic relationships (e.g., judged calmly?Bernardvs.
fake friend - Sal 12 18).4.4 Summary and DiscussionRQ1.
The reuse is significantly non-literal and onlylemmatizing words does not help discovering it.
Ourresults show that reuse in two substantial histor-ical texts requires techniques beyond simple pre-processing (e.g., stemming or lemmatizing), whichexplains why plagiarism-detection systems fail whenparaphrases are used (Alzahrani et al, 2012).
Bibleverses are often used to justify an author?s claim, soonly relevant parts of the Bible verse are reused.
Inthe reuse the Bible verse is modified to better fit thesyntactical and semantic context of an author?s newtext, as shown in Tables 4 and 5.RQ2.1.
The results from our automated approachare encouraging, showing the feasibility of extendingreuse-detection techniques with linguistic resources.Yet, it is not clear which precision and recall couldbe achieved and how existing techniques need to beadapted and calibrated.
This investigation is beyondthe scope of this study and subject to our future work.The linguistic resources support the automated6Translation: ?the God, the good (one)?

(Bible).1856non-lem.
lem.00.51LatinFigure 5: Ratios of literal overlaps in the whole Latindatasetapproach, but only for about one third of the lookups.The manually identified exceptions show that findinga connection between original verse and reuse can bedifficult when there is only a vague semantic one.RQ2.2.
Our results show that the automated ap-proach cannot capture the richness of the manualapproach.
Especially from the exceptions, it is clearthat less-literal reuse does not only need informationfrom a word?s semantic environment, but also thatit needs to be identified by looser relations, such asco-hyponyms, multi-to-multi-word associations orimplicit meanings, which can be hidden in structuralor more broader expert knowledge.5 Threats to ValidityExternal Validity.
We enhance the external valid-ity of our work by focusing on Bible verses?oneof the oldest, most conveyed, and cited sources ofAncient Greek, offering a vast amount of primarysource text and also coming with a long history ofscholars studying it.
Clement of Alexandria is knownfor his retelling of biblical excerpts (Clemens, 19051909; Freppel, 1865), providing an interesting basefor reuse investigation.
The french abbot Bernardof Clairvaux (Smith, 2010) is equally known for hisinfluence to the Cistercian order and his work inbiblical studies.
Furthermore, the chosen lemma re-sources are the most extensive ones existing for An-cient Greek and Latin.
We chose the AGWN, since itis freely available, offering one of the largest synsetdatabase for Ancient Greek and Latin.Internal Validity.
A threat is that our ground truthhas mistakes, as the PoS tagging was done by oneauthor only and relied on a manual post-correction.The selection criteria in Sec.
3.2 were chosen to en-sure quality and comparability.
Extreme outliers inthe length of the reuse instance or source (multipleBible verses) are cut-off.
For Greek, 33 are cut-off,as opposed to Latin, where our sample is significantlysmaller than the whole population that we have.
Toautomatically check whether the sample has similarcharacteristics with respect to the literal reuse, wecreate Fig.
5.
It shows the overlap of the whole 1128instances of Bernard?s extracted reuse, which whencompared to Fig.
2 (right) supports the representa-tiveness of our sample.
Last, we can only deriveoperation replacements when a word token was cov-ered by the lemma sources, contained in AGWN, andwhen there actually exists a relation between twowords.
Also, our authors?
vocabulary can differ interms of domain knowledge, personal idiolect, andage of the Biblical vocabulary.6 ConclusionWe presented a study of historical?and mostly non-literal?text reuse.
We automatically and manuallycharacterize the reuse and identify to what extent ex-isting linguistic resources are able to cover non-literaltext reuse.
Our results show the potential as well asthe necessity to develop robust techniques and to ex-tend linguistic resources for analyzing and detectingsuch reuse.
Our results can help to enhance para-phrase generation to model automatic ways on howsmall text portions can be rephrased.
Considering theeffects of syntactic rearrangement of reuse can alsosupport such efforts.
A smarter automated approachfor deriving an original text excerpt would be learn-ing so-called edit scripts (Kehrer, 2014; Chawatheet al, 1996), which more precisely identify opera-tions an author performed on a text to transform itinto another version.
Whether learning edit scriptson such intricate transformations is possible is anopen question and valuable future research.
Finally,analyzing further languages and data sets helps tofurther complete our findings.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Laurence Mellerin for providing thedatasets we used, and for valuable advice on its con-tent.
