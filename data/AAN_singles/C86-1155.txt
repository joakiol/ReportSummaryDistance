~ Trans  l a t  i onJun-ichi TSUJIIDeportment of Electrical EngineeringRyoto UniversitySakyo-ku, Kyoto 606JAPAN" 1 introductionGood historical surveys and comprehensive currentstate of the art surveys have already been given forMT by several  authors \[Bruderer 1977\] \ [Vauquo is\].979\] \[Nagao 1983\] \[Tucker 1984, 1985\] \[Slocum \]985a\].The object ives,  the basic  design pr inc ip les  and thecurrent stages of development of some of the majorgroups which aim to develop practical and reasonablylarge MT sys tems are found in the specia l  i ssues onMT of ACL \[Slocum 1985b\], where a comprehensive bib-l iography of MT f rom 1973 to 1984 is a lso given.
Inaddition, \[Nishida 1985\] gives a very c lear idea ofwhat is going on in Japanese MT research.All of these surveys show that MT has its ownhistory and techniques deve loped  quite separate lyf rom the other research areas of natura l  languageprocessing, especially the areas of natural languageunderstanding (NLU Jn short).
The researchers in NLUhave repeatedly compla ined that current MT systemst rans late  texts w i thout  unders tand ing  them.
On theother hand, the MT researchers have claimed that NLUresearches have always developed 'proto-type' systemswhich  only deal  w i th  texts in s t rong ly  res t r i c tedsubject  f ietds and cannot  be extended to cover va-rious linguistic phenomena found in the other fields.However,  it is obvious that the prob lems concernedwith 'understanding texts' cannot be avoided for thefuture development of high quality translation sys-tems, and, in fact, several  exper imenta l  sys tems\[Carbonel\] 11.978, 81\] \[Lytinen 1982\] \ [ Ishizaki  1986\]\ [Nomura 1986\] aims to translate texts throughunderstanding them.In this paper, we wil l  discuss several problemsconcerned with 'understanding and translation', espe-cial ly how we can integrate the two l ines of re-search, with their different histories and differenttechniques, into unified frameworks, and the diffi-cul t ies we might  encounter  in a t tempt ing  such anintegration.
The discussion wil\] reveal some of thereasons why MT researches are so separated from theresearch in the other application fields of NLP.
Wewi l l  also list some of the key prob lems,  bothlinguistic and computat ional ,  which we encounteredduring the deve lopment  of our MT systems, the Musystems \[Nagao \]984, 85, 86\] \[Tsujii 1984, 85\]\ [Nakamura 1984, 86 \] \ [Sakamoto 1984\], and whoseresolutions we consider to be of essential importancefor future MT research and development.2 T rans la t ion  between J apa~\]ese and Indo-EuropeanLanguagesThe MT research  and deve lopment  ac t iv i t ies  inJapan including the Mu project are distinguished fromothers in that they all aim to treat language pairsof qui te d i f fe rent  \ ]anguage famil ies,  i.e.
Japaneseand one of the Indo-European languages, typ ica\ ] lyEnglish; most  of the ac t iv i t ies  in other parts  ofthe world, wi th  few except ions  \[Tong 1986 \] \[Loh1975\]\[Feng \]982\], have focused on translation amongIndo-European \]anguages.
Because Japanese is qui ted iE ferent  f rom Indo-European languages in var iousaspects such as its \ ]exica\]  items, syntact ic  andsemantic structures, etc., the t rans \ ]a t \ ]on  processbas to be much more sophisticated.The experience of PAIIO-SPANAM \[Vasconcellos 1985\]shows, for example, in the translation from Spanishto English, that translation results sufficient fornative speakers of Engl ish  to correct  t rans la t ionerrors can be obtained even without having a separatephase (the ana lys i s  phase) of obta in ing  exp l ic i trepresentat ions  of the syntact ic  s t ruc tures  ofsource sentences.
In contrast to this, because Japa-nese  and Eng l i sh  have  qu i te  d i f fe rent  phraseorderings,  resu l ts  of th.i.s s tandard  cannot beobtained in Japanese-English translation unless theentire syntact ic  s t ructure  of the source sentencesis captured.
Fur thermore ,  in Japanese-Ehg l i shtranslat ion,  d i f fe rent  syntactic interpretations ofsource sentences  a lmost  a lways  lead to d i f fe rentt rans lat ions  so that we cannot expect  syntact icambigu i t ies  to be preserved  in both  languages.
Thatis, a l though the METAl, group \[Beneht 1985\] reportsthat'We employ only the highest-scoring reading (i.e.syntact ic  interpretat.ion) for t rans la t ion  .
.
.
.Surpr i s ing ly  often, a number  of the h igher -scor inginterpretations will be translated identical',we can rare ly  expect this to happen in t rans la t ionbetween Japanese and English.
Moreover,  certa insyntactic concepts which are supposed to be common toall Indo-European languages are quite problematic inJapanese.
For example,\]..We do not \]\]ave in Japanese  expl ic i t  mark ing ofdefJ nite and indef in i te  d is t inct ions  among nounphrases by determiners2.Whether the concept of syntactic subject exists inJapanese or not is undetermined  among Japaneselinguists3.Although re lat ive clause constructions in Englishand embedded clause constructions in Japanese roughlycorrespond to each other, the two constructions havequite different characteristics.
Japanese  embedded655c lauses  shou ld  be t rans la ted  into  many  o thersyntactic constructions such as (preposition + --ing\]forms of phrases  which modi fy  nouns, appos i t iona lphrases  in t roduced by 'that', etc., depend ing  on thesemantic relationships between the modifying clauses(embedded clauses) and the modif ied noun \[Nagao 1984,1986\].These  fac ts  ind icate  that  captur ing  thesyntact ic  s t ructures  of entire source sentences  isnecessary ,  a l though not su f f i c ient ,  for thetranslation between English and Japanese.
Moreover,we need a certain amount of change in the syntacticstructures of source sentences in order to generatenatural translations.
It is obvious that translationbetween all language pairs requires more or lessstructural change, but to what extent such structurechange is necessary and to what extent such structurechange requ i res  semant ic  or ext ra - l ingu is t i cknow\] .edge (and so, cannot  be sys temat ica l lyformulated upon syntactic structures alone) is highlydependent on individual language pairs.
Pairs such asJapanese and one of the Indo-European languages offerone of the extremes:we often have to refer to deeperstructures than syntactic ones, such as the so-calledsemant ic  or conceptua l  st ructures of sentences,  inorder to obtain natural translations.That 'deeper' understanding is relevant to highqua l i ty  t rans la t ions  is in tu i t i ve ly  obv ious .However, the discrepancy between Japanese and Indo-European languages is so large that even atcertain deeper levels the discrepacy still remains;l. The cor respondence  of words  in the two languages,English and Japanese, is not so straightforward.
Thisimpl ies  that a set of semant ic  or conceptua l  units,f rom which deeper  level representat ions  of sourcesentences might  be constructed,  is d i f f i cu l t  todefine (see Section 4).2.A single event in the real world is often capturedd i f fe rent ly  in the two languages.
For example,  anevent which is expressed  in Engl ish  by a sentencewith a transitive verb is often expressed in Japaneseby a sentence with an intransitive verb accompaniedby a deep cause case e lement.
Even deep semant iccase re la t ionsh ips  seem then to be dependent  onindividual languages.
Although more or less the samephenomenon has been  observed even in t rans la t ionamong Indo-European languages (for example,  (King,1986\]), the difference between Japanese and the Indo-European languages in terms of their  deep casestructures remains particularly large.These considerations have led the MT researchersin Japan to basic  p rob lems as to what  kinds of'understanding' are relevant to translation, whetherresul ts  of 'understanding' sentences (texts) can berepresented independently from individual languages,and f inally, what  'understanding' sentences canreal ly mean.
These issues should  be made clear notonly for translations of language pairs belonging toquite d i f fe rent  language fami l ies  but also fordeve lop ing  future  high qua l i ty  MT sys tems for anylanguage pair.
The Japanese Min is t ry  of Post  andTelecommunication, for example, recently announced snew, 15 year project for the simultaneous translationof te lephone communicat ion ,  in wh ich  ord inaryd ia logues  wi l l  be translated.
We cannot  expect insuch a system the heavy interventions of professionaltranslators that most current MT systems presume.Raw translation results should be natural enough for656peop le  w i thout  any knowledge  of the sourcelanguages.3 Basic ApproachesOne of the recurr ing cont rovers ies  among MTresearchers  has been between the adopt ion  of thet rans fer  approach  and the adopt ion  of theinter l ingual  approach,  and this seems ext remelyrelevant to various issues of the possible relation--ships between 'understanding' and 'translation' infuture MT systems.
The transfer approach, originallyproposed by GETA \[Vauquois1979\] and adopted by manyresearch and deve lopment  groups inc lud ing  the MUproject,  EUROTRA \[King 1981\] \[ Johnson 1985\], TAUM\[Kittredge 1976\] \ [ Isabel le 1985\], METAL \[S\]ocum1982\] \[Bennet 1985\] , PAHO-ENGSPA \ [Vasconcel los  1985\] ,ASCOF\ [B iewer  1985\] etc., is an approach in wh icht rans la t ion  is carr ied out essent ia l l y  in threephases: analysis, t rans fer  and generat ion.
Thesecond phase, transfer, is a contrastive phase wherelexical items, stereotyped expressions, and the syn-tactic and semantic structures of two languages arecompared  so that both lexical  i tems and certa inlevels of the l inguist ic  s t ructures  of the sourcelanguages may be t rans fer red  to their  'equivalents'in the target languages.The interlingual or pivot approach, which hasbeen repeatedly advocated by researchers  o r ig ina l lyinterested in natura l  language unders tand ing  (NLU)who take machine translation as one possible applica-tion \[Muraki 1982, 1986\] \[Lytinen 1982\], instead per-forms translation through two phases, understandingand paraphrasing.
The results of the first phase inthis approach  are supposed to be represented  in theform of express ions  of inter l ingua,  f rom wh ich  thesecond phase may generate the target sentences.
Theexpressions of interlingua are language universal inthe sense that the second phase can generate  targetsentences f rom them wi thout  cons ider ing  what  thesource language is.
It is claimed that this approachis super ior  to the t rans fer  approach because of thefollow ing advantages.l .Mu l t i -L ingua l  Trans lat ion:  Because this approachdoes not have any phases dependent on language pairs,only two kinds of modules for transforming sentencesof individual languages to expressions of interlinguaand vice versa are necessary for mu l t i - l i ngua ltranslations.2.High qua l i ty  Trans lat ion:  Because this  approachf irst unders tands  source sentences and then para-phrases the 'understanding' in the target languages,the t rans la t ion  results are natural  and easy tounderstand.Fig.\].
is a schemat ic  f igure often used forexp la in ing  the re la t ionsh ip  between the t rans ferapproach and the inter l ingual  approach  \[Vauquois1979\] \[Tucker \]985\].
This f igure shows that there isan abst rac t ion  h ierarchy  of descr ip t ions  such assurface word sequences, surface syntactic structures,deep syntact ic  structures,  semant ic  structures,conceptual  structures, etc.
where, at the deeperlevels, the descr ip t ions  of sentences of d i f fe rentindiv idual  \ ]anguages become c loser  and f inal ly, atthe deepest  level (the level of understanding),converge.SL Text TL TextS c~: ic  S t r  .

Contextual  Str.Unde rs  rand  ingFig.\].. A Naive Schemat ic  Figure of Translat ionWhich is often used but quite mis leadingThis f igure ,  however ,  is o f ten  mis lead ing  inthat it suggests an interpretat ion where each levelof the hierarchy may replace the shal lower  levels ofdescr ip t ion .
Th is  is to in terpret  the f igure  asshowing  that  each  \ ]eve\ ]  Jn the h ie rarchy  canexpress in its own descr ipt ive f ramework  all aspectsof the informat ion conveyed by source sentences: oncea descr ip t ion  at the deeper  \].evel is ach ieved,  itcan rep lace  the sha\] lower ,  more  sur face -or ientedlevels  of descr ip t ion .
This imp\] ies that  thetransfer approach is more a tentative approach onlyadopted  unt i l  we deve lop  technologies for 'under-standing' texts and the f rameworks  for express ing theresult of understanding, that is, interlingua.The ear ly  exper iences  of CETA, however ,  showthat this naive v iew does not work well.
The surfacesyntact i c  s t ruc tures  of sentences ,  fo~ example ,cannot  be rep laced  fu l l y  by the i r  deep  case s t ruc -tures,  because  sur face  s t rnc tures  convey  ext ra -informat ion concerned with, for example, the focusof the d i scourse ,  the d i s t inc t ion  of o ld /newin fo rmat ion  in the context ,  emphas ized  e\].ements orphrases ,  etc., and such  ext ra - in fo rmat ion  is a l sorelevant to the determinat ion of the target sentencestructures.
General ly  speak ing ,  for t rans la t ion ,  wehave to ext rac t  f rom texts,  not on ly  what  isdescr ibed (the extra- l inguist ic  aspects of texts) butalso how Jt is descr ibed  and how the texts  areorganized(the l inguist ic aspects of texts) .The early, naive inter l ingual  approach tended toput emphas is  on just what  is descr ibed .
The sametendency  may also be observed  in some par ts  ofl inguist ics and recent knowledge-based approaches toMT.
F i l lmore 's  in i t ia l  not ion  of cases  \ [F i l lmore1968\],  for example ,  was proposed  for re ta in ingident i t ies  of events  in the real  wor ld  wh ich  areexpressed di f ferent ly in sur face  sentences ,  so thatthe sentencesJohn opened the door wi th the key.The key opened the door.The door opened.are al l  reduced  to the same case s t ruc tures .
How-ever, even if they  descr ibe  the same real wor ldevents,  they  descr ibe  those  events  f rom d i f fe rentv iew points .
At least,  the sentences  may p layd i f fe rent  ro les  in d i scourse ,  and so, when they  areput  in a cer ta in  context ,  some of them may v io la tediscourse coherency and be less natural than others.One could claim, as researchers of know ledgebased approaches often do, that, because discoursero les  of sentences  shou ld  be determined  dur ing  thegenerat ion (paraphrasing) phase by 'inte\].ligent' textgenerators, the ana lys i s  (unders tand ing)  phase  neednot ext rac t  fac tors  re\].evant to d i scourse  f romsource  texts .
It is p robab ly  t rue  that  somedJ scourse  fac tors  and so some par ts  of sur facel inguist ic structure should be determined during thegenerat ion  phase  of ta rget  texts.
EIowever, becausethe same sequences  of events  in the rea l  wor ld  canusually be descr ibed by a number of d i f ferent texts,each having its own coherent discourse structure, MTsys tems shou ld  be ab le  to se lec t  one  of themdynamJ  ea l ly  based  on the text  s t ruc tures  of thesource languages.
Certain factors concerned with thetext organizat ion of the source languages should beext rac ted  dur ing  the ana lys i s  phase  to fac i l i ta tesuch se lec t ion .
Otherwise ,  however  inte l l J  gent  thetext genera lo rs  might  be, they  may a lways  generatethe same texts  as t rans la t ions  of d i f fe rent \ ]  yo rgan ized  source  texts  whenever  'essent ia l ly '  thesame sequences of events are described, albeit  fromdif ferent v iew points and attitudes.A l though there are certain types of texts, suchas 'factual' newsreporti.ng art ic les of newspapers  onte r ro r i sm \ [ I sh i zak i  \[986\] \ [Lyt inen 11982\] in wh ichonly what  events  occured  in the real  wor \ ]d  and inwhat  order are J mportaut, there are, of course, farmore var ied types of texts to be translated.
\[Tucker\].984\] also notes this point as follows.
'In spite of its initial appeal, the knowldge basedapproach  -- ra i ses  some we ighty  quest ions ,  forexample ,  .... To what  degree  are the sc r ip ts  ofknow\]edge based mach ine  t rans la t ion  we l l  su i ted  to'non-story'  texts  such as conference  proceed ings ,sc ient i f ic  artic\]es, and budget documents  ?
'There is, however, another possible interpreta-t ion for Fig.l.
Here the h ie rarchy  is taken as ah ie rarchy  of the depth  of p rocess ing  dur ing  theanalysis phase, according to what  kinds of informa-t ion are be ing  exp l i c i t l y  ext rac ted  f rom sourcesentences at each level \[Boitet 1984\].
In this view,an analysis program which per forms process ing to acer ta in  level  g ives  as its output  cer ta in  s t ruc -tura l  descr ip t ions  (or sets  of structural  descr ip-t ions) wh ich  conta in  exp l i c i t  representat ions  ofin fo rmat ion  up to that  level .
An ana lys i s  p rogramwh ich  processes  sentences  to the leve l  of  deep cases t ruc tures ,  for  example ,  outputs  cer ta in  descr ip -t ions  f rom wh ich  the o ther  p rogram,  the t rans ferprogram, can retr ieve informat ion of, not only deepcase relationships, but also surface syntact ic struc-tures  and sur face  order ing  of the words  of inputsentences, without any further l inguist ic processing.The current t ransfer-based MT systems usual lys tand  on th i s  v iew, where,  based  on the deep  casestructures and surface syntact ic structures of sourcesentences  revea led  dur ing  the ana lys i s  phase,  thetransfer programs compute the most appropr iate cor-responding descr ipt ions  of  ta rget  sentences .
In thecuurent  t rans fer -based  sys tems,  however, d iscoursefactors are not usually expressed expl ic i t ly  in thedescr ip t ions  but are imp l i c i t l y  p reserved  in thesur face  syntact i c  s t ruc tures  wh ich  preserve  thesurface orderings of phrases.
The surface syntactics t ruc tures  are then preserved  dur ing  the t rans ferphase as much as possibJ.e so that discourse ro\].es ofe lements in the sentences are presumably  t ransferredto the target descriptions.
This pr inciple of 'usingsource sentences as mou\ ]ds  of target sentences' worksrather wel l  in translat ion among languages with manys imi la r i t ies  because  the syntact i c  not ions  of onelanguage such as syntact ic subject often play a lmostthe same discourse roles in the other languages.657However, though the same principle works to acer ta in  extent  in the t rans la t ion  between Japaneseand Indo-European languages, it does not work  sowell.
In the t rans la t ion  of such a language pair,because surface syntactic s t ruc tures  of source sen-tences often have to be drastically changed in orderto realize the deep case relations in the target, theprinciple itself becomes hard to follow.
In addition,though the principle is based on the assumption thatsyntactic notions such as syntactic subject etc.
playthe same roles in the two languages, the assumptionis not valid.
The pr inciple,  therefore,  tends toproduce either understandable but unnatural transla-tions, or to make the t rans fer  component  ad-hoc,complex, and difficult to maintain when we attempt toget natural translations.
Furthermore, as can easilybe seen, the principle is not even satisfactory forthe translation of similar languages when we want toget high quality translations.
It is obvious that wehave to extract explicitly more kinds of informationfrom source texts than deep case structures and util-ize these to compute descriptions of the target sen-tences.Note that 'to extract more kinds of informationexp l i c i t ly  dur ing  the analysis' does not, in fact,necessarily mean 'to express such kinds of informa-tion in a language independent framework' nor does itimply that such extracted information can fully re-p lace the sha l lower  levels  of descr ipt ion.
Indeed,because the l ingu is t ic  aspects  concerned  with 'hewthings are described', 'how texts are organized' etc.are more language- in terna l  aspects  than those of'what are described', it is likely that they are moredifficult to express in a language universal frame-work.Our tentative view of future MT systems, whichis based on the transfer approach and wil l  be zevisedin a later section, is shown in Fig.2.
In this frame-work, the ana lys i s  phase is expected  to ext ract  ex-p l ic i t ly  many more d i f fe rent  kinds of informationother than deep case relat ionships.

We neitherexpect, as descr ibed  above, that such ext rac ted  in-formation should be represented in a language univer-sal manner, nor expect that they uniquely determinesurface syntactic structures of source sentences.
Inthis sense, they need not be a complete  set offactors determin ing  surface s t ruc tures  of sourcesentences and so the surface structures cannot bereplaced by the set of these factors.
They mere lygive us a framework which facilitates the systematiccomparison of the two languages.
Based on the set ofthese factors, the t rans fer  phase computes  corre-sponding factors of target sentences inc lud ing dis-course factors, semantic structures, syntactic struc-tures, etc.
f rom which the generat ion  phase wi l lgenerate target surface syntactic structures.
As theextracted factors give the transfer component a con-straint set which is to be satisfied if possible, thefactors computed in the transfer give a similar setof cond i t ions  to be sat is f ied  in the generat ionphase.Though our current view of future MT systems isbased on the transfer approach, our objective in thissect ion is not to c la im that this approach issuper ior  to the in ter l ingua l  approach,  but only toc la im that the word 'understanding texts' in thecontext of MT is quite vague and, therefore, that wehave to examine  and define what  is real ly meant  bythe mythical word 'understanding' be fore  d i scuss ingthe advantages  and d i sadvantages  of the twoapproaches .
In fact ,  wh i le  severa l  l a rge  andpractical MT systems, including some commercial lyavai lable,  have been deve loped in Japan based ond i f fe rent  approaches  such as the 'Pivot approach'\[Muraki 1985\], 'Conceptual Transfer Approach' \[Uchida1980, 1985\]  \ [Amano 1985\],  ' Integrated Approach'\[Tanaka 1983\] , each of which puts emphas is  on di f -ferent aspects  of t rans lat ion processes, especiallyon aspects  of 'understanding', when one c loselyexamines the internal translation processes and whatkinds of information are utilized in these systems,one in fact  f inds many s imi la r i t ies  and fewer  di f -ferences than one might have expected.Before ending this section, we would  like toadd some comments: First of all, we neither deny theex is tence of certa in  levels of unders tand ing  wh ichare language universal nor their importance and rel-evance to translat ion.
On the contrary,  we arewil l ing to accept such claims.
Our objective is onlyto claim that such levels of 'understanding results'should be integrated with other aspects of informa-tion conveyed by input texts.
Second, though it isimplicitly assumed by the researchers of the inter-l ingual  approaches that the t rans fer  approach  isincompatible with 'understanding texts', that assUmp-tion, as Fig.2.
shows, is simply wrong.Translation and UnderstandinqIn order to discuss the problem on a more concretebasis, we wi l l  f i rst  see how 'understanding of asentence' has been understood in convent iona l  NLUframeworks.Fig.
3. shows a s imp l i f i ed  f ramework  of an NLUsystem.
In this framework, 'understanding of a sen-tence' is regarded  as a process  of t rans format ionfrom an input sentence S, a linear sequence of words,into a mean ing  representat ion  M(S).
The M(S), inturn, is used as an input to a certa in  scheme of' internal process ing'  such as a deductive inference,p rob lem so lv ing  program, etc., which Js actua l lyimp lemented  as a computer  p rogram to carry out acerta in spec i f i c  task.
In this f ramework ,  themeanings of input sentences are defined Jn terms ofthe ' internal processing'  specif ic  to ind iv idua l'understanding' systems, and so the results  ofIunders tand ing '  are represented  by symbo l i cexpress ion~ which can be in terpreted by internalprograms for specific tasks.\[AnalysisProcedure \]IInput SentenceSSyntactic Meani ngDescrip k J on - - \ [ In terpreta t ion \ ]  ~ RepresentationM(s)_tInternal \]Program for |a Specific Task Iwhich works on |M(S)Fig.3 A Simplified Framework of an NLUAn ordiz~ary NL front end for a data base system,for example, transforms sentences into expressions ofa certain query Ianguage such as SQI,, an artificiallanguage designed Ifor data base accesses.
The inter-nal program in this case is tile SQL interpreter whichcan execute the expressions to retrieve appropriatedata.
As all ex t reme example,  the STUDENT system\[D.Bobrow \].968\], which solves exercises of arithme-tic expressed  in English, t rans forms texts into asimultaneous equation.
In this system, the 'meaning'of an input text is an equation.Such transformation from an input to the M(S) \]sessentiaIly an information extraction process whereonly in fo rmat ion  re levant  to spec i f i c  tasks is ex-tracted; it is not an information preserving processin tbe sense that exact surface sentences usual lycannot be re-generated from information extracted.
Ino ther  words ,  M(S) used  so far represent  the'meanings' of input sentences only from a certa inpoint  of view, that is, from the v iew point of'internal processing' for a specific task, and there-fore, on ly  preserve in fo rmat ion  re levant  to thattask.
Though other frameworks which have been adoptedby NLU rese;~rchers in certa in f ields such as 'textunderstandi.ng' seem to have d i f fe rent  f lavors, theessent ia l  f ramework  is a lmost  the same.
In thesesystems, 'understanding texts' i s taken to be aprocess  of re la t ing  texts to internal  'knowledge'cal led 'scripts', 'frames', 'schemas' etc.
p reparedin the systems beforehand.
Knowledge in these systemsis claimed to imitate human conceptual memory formedthrough exper iences  in the real wor ld and to begeneral  in the sense that it is independent  of spe-cific tasks.
Such systems, however, also have theirown tasks such as 'paraphrasing', ' summary  genera-tion' etc.
to show their  unders tand ing  capab i l i t i esby external behaviour; these tasks implicitly definethe content  and descr ip t ive  f rameworks  of theirknowledge  so that the in fo rmat ion  to be extractedfrom texts is restr icted.
In addit ion, because theinternal forms of knowledge to which input texts arere lated usua l ly  ref lect  situations (or sequences ofevents) in the real  world,  they have noth ing to dodirectly with linguistic texts.
That is, 'understand-~ng results'  in these systems often miss the lin-guistic aspects of texts.In cont ras t  to a res t r i c ted  approach to mean ingextraction, however, the aim of translation JsIto re-express by using sentences of target \] an-guages the in fo rmat ion  of all aspects  conta ined insentences of source languages, with as \]east distor-tion as possible'.It is commonly recognized by l~nguists that a\]\]different surface sentences convey different informa-tion.
If we share th\]s understanding,  the M(S) inMT should v \ ] r tua\ ] \ ]y  retain in format  ion for re-generating exact source sentences.
That is, we do nothave any 'internal processings' Jn MT by which we candefine certa in  aspects  of in fo rmat ion  conveyed bytexts.
The M(.~;) of source sentences  in MT shouldpreserve information of a\] \] kinds conveyed by sourcesentences,  not only  what Js descr ibed  by the textsbut also how it is descr ibed,  f rom what  v iew po intsand by what  att itudes.
Such cons iderat ions  have ledus to the f ramework  a\] ready shown as Fig.
2. in thisframework, we abandon single layers of descriptionsfor represent ing  'unders tand ing  resu l ts ' ,  andinstead, have several layers of descriptions whichco l lec t ive ly  determine  the surface syntactic struc-tures of the source sentences and which are a\]\] tobe utilized durLng the transfer.Based on this assumpt ion  of the mui t i - \ ]ayereddescription o\[ source texts, we can thin\]< of certain\].ayers of descr ip t ion  wh ich  are language universal.and wh ich  cor respond to 'understanding resu\]ts '  inconvent ional  NLU systems.
We wi l l  d iscuss in thefollowing sections some of the problems in util izingthese extra-l inguistic Layers of 'understanding' int rans la t ion  processes  and what  roles these layersshou\].d play in the preeess as a whole.5 Words and ConceptsWe wi l l  f i rst  examine  the basic  units fromwhich complex expressions in these language independ-ent layers  might  be constructed.

In this view, eachword of individual languages denotes a language inde-pendent  or ext ra - l ingu is t i c  concept,  though somewords  are ambiguous  and denote  several  d i f fe rent(mutual ly  d ist ingui  shable) concepts.
Such conceptsdenoted by words in indiv idual  languages are thebasic units of language un iversa l  descr ipt ion.
Inthis view, words of individual languages are relatedto each other through the concepts, and translationof words f rom one language to another  is to be per-formed s t ra ight fo rward ly  through these concepts.This v iew is we\]\].-f itted for the te rmino log ica lconcepts and words in a sc ient i f i c  f ield.The wordword of Language-i _ _Word  of Language-5- ~ _ J \[F .... hi \[Japanese\]Word of l.,anguage-2~ Linguistic ~word  of Language-6\[Chinese\] - - - - ~ ~  \[German\]Word of Language-3" / ~ "word of Language-7\[Korean\] / < \[EnglJ sh\]Word of Language-4 word of Language-8\[Russian\] \[MalaylFig.4 A Naive View of Relationshipsbetween Words and Concepts659'mass' in physics,  for example,  denotes a certa inconcept  cal led 'mass' in Engl ish  or 'shitsuryou' inJapanese.

The concepts denoted by ordinarywords  such as 'to introduce', 'to produce', 'advan-tages', 'fields' etc.
do not have fo rmal  exp l i c i tdefinitions, even if we accept the existence of suchdenoted 'concepts'.
Especial ly,  as \[Hobbs 1984\]noted, verbs are usua l ly  used to descr ibe quitedifferent situations or events in the real world.
Heg ives  the fo l low ing  examples  of usages of 'top roduce '  in med ica l  textbooks  on hepat i t i s  asfollows.A disease can produce a conditionA virus can produce a diseaseSomething can produce a virus.Intesia flora can produce compoundsetc.Note that, in Japanese, we have a verb 'tsukuri-dasu' wh ich  roughly cor responds  to 'to produce' inEngl ish, but some of the above usages of 'to pro-duce' wou ld  need  to be t rans la ted  into a d i f fe rentJapanese verb, 'hikiokosu'.
In order to retain thesimplicity of t rans lat ion through ext ra - l ingu is t i cconcepts, we have to prepare  at least  two d i f fe rentconcepts denoted by 'to produce' which are denoted inJapanese by 'tsukuridasu' and 'hikiokosu', respec-tively.
Moreover, because we can easily recognize thed i f fe rences  among s i tuat ions  descr ibed  by 'to pro-duce' in the above sentences,  it is natura l  toimagine that there may be other languages which re-quire fur ther  d iv is ion of the concepts.
The naivescheme in Fig.
4. may resu l t  in a p ro l i fe ra t ion  ofconcepts and cannot  exp la in  the cor respondence  ofwords in different languages.Hobb's answer  (and, of many other researchersboth in NLU and linguistics) to this question, whichis in tu i t i ve ly  reasonable ,  is: 'to produce' in theabove examples is not a polysemy, because all of the660above usages share a certain core meaning in commonsuch as 'x causes  y to come into existence'.
Thiskind of approach, the lexical  decompos i t ion  ap-proach, not only  can prevent  the pro l i fe ra t ion  ofconcepts, but it also has another advantage in thatit reduces the d ivers i ty  of surface express ions  byrepresenting sentences with different surface verbssuch as 'to produce', 'to create', 'to generate' etc.by the same combinations of primitives.
Such a reduc-tion is pre ferab le  for 'know\]edge' based process ingwh ich  u t i l i zes  ext ra - l ingu is t i c  knowledge, i.e.
setof rules intrinsic to external worlds, because theprocess ing is concerned with events  or s i tuat ionsdescr ibed  by texts but not d i rect ly  concerned  withtexts themselves.Though such reduction is inevitable for certainkinds of knowledge  based process ing,  we have tonotice that the lexical  decompos i t ion  approach, byitself, does not explain anything about lexical cor-respondence  among d i f ferent  languages.
On the con-trary, it may increase  the d i f f i cu l t ies  of lexicalchoice in translat ion.
In order to d i sc r iminate  'toassass inate '  f rom 'to kill', 'to murder '  etc.,though we have a rather direct correspondence between'to assass inate '  in Engl ish  and 'annsatsusuru' inJapanese, we have to encode many kinds of informationother thal\] 'X cause Y to become not to be alive' suchas Y's social status, the reason of 'killing' (polit-ical or not) and, in general,  the speaker's concep-tion of the 'killing' event in question.
In otherwords, the description cannot replace surface lexical:items un less  a complete  set of (cognit ive or other)i_~etors relevant to surface lexical choices are fullyspecified.
The fact that most decompositionists havebeen only concerned with verbs shows that to specifysuch a set of p r imi t ives  for express ing  even onlythe core mean ings  of nouns is far more di f f icult .
(Note that 'field' shou ld  be t rans lated into six ormore different nouns in Japanese \[Nagao \].986\]) Fur-thermore, because the factors to be cons ideredre levant ,  or the features  of s i tuat ions  to bedescr ibed that are cons idered  to be relevant, tosurface lexical choices are highly dependent on eachlexical  i tem (and so, of course, dependent  on eachlanguage), we cannot expect to have a complete setof factors which can be applied to choices of everylexical item of every individual language.
Trying toget such a language independent set may result in aproliferation of factors instead of the proliferationof ext ra - l ingu is t i c  concepts found in the naivescheme.Again, note that we do not c la im that theaspect of understanding captured by decomposition isi r re levant  to translat ion.
Instead, it const i tu tesone of several  ind ispensab le  layers of descr ip t ionwh ich  fac i l i ta te  sys temat ic  compar i son  of the twolanguages.
In order  to t rans late 'to assass inate 'correctly into Japanese, we have to discriminate theliteral meaning and metaphorical meanings of theword (such as 'to hurt someone's honor by a nastytr ick or verba l  abuse'), because the Japanese  verb'annsatsusuru' may express the latter, the metaphor-ical meaning.
Such discrimination obviously requiresunders tand ing  of what  rea l ly  happened in the realworld,  and the unders tand ing  at this level (contex-tual unders tand ing  level) should be expressed  by adescriptive framework using a certain set conceptualp r imi t ives  (because unders tand ing  resul ts  of thislevel should be represented independently from sur-face d ivers i f ied  texts).
We only c la im that thedescr ip t ion  only expresses certa in aspects of'meanings' of surface words and it cannot replacethem.
We also c la im that any a t tempts  to get acomplete, language universal set of primitives forexplaining lexical choices in any language will bein vain, and that what  we rea l ly  need at present  ismuch more comprehensive comparative studies on lexi-cal choices between languages in question in order toc lar i fy  what  k inds of factors are re levant  to theselection of appropriate target equivalents for eachindividual word of the source language.6 Implicit i\[nformationThe discussion in the last section can be summa-rized thus; Because a continuously infinite physical-/menta l  wor ld  is descr ibed by a natura l  languagewh ich  has only f inite words, words  in indiv iduallanguages are used to descr ibe  certa in  ranges o\[events /ob jects .
That is, 'meanings' of words  a~:tquite vague.
This vagueness  causes  d i f f i cu l t ies  oflexical  choice in t rans la t ion  by the fact  that cer-tain families of events/objects which can be des-cr ibed by the same words in one language should bedescr ibed  by severa l  d i f fe rent  words in otherlanguages (Fig.

That is, the setof (cognitive or other) factors which determine sur-face express ions  changes from one language toanother.
Or, even if s imi la r  factors work in thedeterminat ion  of sur face express ions,  they may bereflected by using quite different syntactic devices.It of ten happens that to determine  target surfaceexpress ions  requi res  a set of factors  wh ich  are notexpressed at all in the source language or which arequite implicit, even if they are expressed.On the one hand, to t rans late  Japanese  to Eng-lish, for example, we have to have information aboutplural-singular and definiteness-indefin it en ess d is-t inct ions  of noun phrases which are imp l i c i t  inJapanese.The Japanese sentence'watashi-ha kino kangofu-ni  atta.
'\[I\] \[yesterday\] \[nurse\] \[to meet\]\[past\]may correspond to the fo l low ing  four sentences  inEnglish, depending on the context.
'I met a nursethe nursenursesthe nursesyesterday'Because Japanese  nat ive speakers do not feelexplicitly the above sentence lacks information, wecan c la im that  the sentence  is just  vague  as'meanings' of words  are.
That  is, the sentence candescribe a set of situations in the real world whichshare certain properties in common, but in English,the same set of s i tuat ions should be expressedd i f ferent ly ,  depend ing  on proper t ies  of s i tuat ionswh ich  are not re levant  to the se lec t ion  of Japaneseexpressions and which therefore remain implicit inJapanese.On the other hand, Japanese is rich Jn honorificexpressions and highly dependent on speaker-h~arer'ssocial re lat ionships.
Therefore, in the translationfrom Engl i sh  to Japanese, we have to recover  suchin fo rmat ion  which is impl ic i t  in English.
Forexample, a simple sentence such as'I'll come tomorrow'may correspond to Japanese sentences such as'asu oukagai /tashimasu'\[the hearer is blgher in the social position\]'asu oukaigai shimasu'\[the hearer is higher in the social position\]\[the speaker is intimate with the hearer\]'asu ikuyo'\[the speaker is intimate with the hearer\]\[the speaker is male\]'asu ikuwa'\[the speaker is intimate with the hearer\]\[the speaker is female\]'asu ik imasu'\[neutral\]Eng l i sh  nat ive  speakers  certainly do not thinkthat the sentence is ambiguous in the above sense.
Inthis case, Japanese requires information about socialstatus of speakers and hearers, wh ich  is not sorelevant to the selection of English expressions.Speaker's intentions, which recent researches ofNLU \ [Brady  1983\]  \ [Appe l t  1985\]  \ [Grosz  1986\] ,espec ia l ly  in d ia logue systems, p lace a st rongemphas is  upon, are a typical  example  of imp l i c i tin format ion ,  and we can easi ly imag ine  s i tuat ionswhere it also plays an important role in translation,espec ia l ly  in t rans la t ion  of d ia logues  such as thesimultaneous translation of telephone communication.It is, however, not desi'rable for translation systemsto translate sentences according to speaker's inten-tion alone.
T rans la t ing  'It's hot in this  room' to'mado-o akete kudasai' (Please open the window) pro-bably commits too much as a translation system.
Thesystem should select natural  express ions  in targetlanguages  as long as they  do not  d i s to r t  the'meanings' of source sentences too much.
This impliesthat 'understanding of sentences' and 'the mean ingsof sentences' should be distinguished.
What is meantby 'unders tand ing  of sentences '  is, as recentresearches in NLU typically show, to understand thesituations where certain utterances are given or thes i tuat ions which texts descr ibe,  inc lud ing suchfactors as speaker's intent ions,  speaker -heater ' ssocial relationships, definiteness/indefiniteness ofre ferenced objects, etc.
Though these factors  arere levant  to the se lect ion  of target  express ions,  itis doubt fu l  that all such der ived in fo rmat ion  is apart of the descr ip t ion  of source sentences  wh ichexpresses  var ious factors determin ing  the surface661expressions in the source language.
Researchers inNLU often confuse unders tand ing  resul ts  w i th  thedescription of input sentences.As noted before,  the researches  in NLU so farhave revealed that 'understanding sentences' cannotbe def ined, at least  computat iona l ly ,  w i thoutconsidering certain specific internal tasks, and thetask of MT, 'to re -express  in target  languages theinformation conveyed by sentences of source languageswi th  as least d i s to r t ion  as possible', by itself,does not de f ine  anyth ing about what  k inds of under -s tanding are requ i red  in MT.
Because the factorsrelevant to the determination of surface structuresare dependent  on each language, the exact requ i re -ments on what aspects of the situations described bysource texts should be 'understood' cannot be f ixedunless the language to wh ich  the texts are to hetranslated is specified.Eng l i sh  nat ive  speakers,  for example,  can 'un-derstand''I'll come tommorrow'without any attention to the social relationships ofthe speaker and the hearer.
Only when they are askedto t rans late  the sentence into Japanese, must  theyconsciously consider such factors to select the mostappropr iate  Japanese  expression.
The same line ofd iscuss ion can be app l ied  to the prob lem of targetword selection.
We cannnot enumerate, by monolingualthinking, d i f fe rent  'concepts' denoted  by the verb'to produce'.
Only when we are asked to t rans latesentences containing the verb into another language,can we try to f ind  appropr ia te  target words.
Dur ingthis process, 'understanding of the sentences' and so'understanding of the s i tuat ions  descr ibed  by theverb' are promoted  in such a d i rec t ion  that we canidentify the most appropriate target verbs.The above d iscuss ion  impl ies  that  certa in  'un-derstanding processes' are target language dependent,and cannot  be ful ly spec i f ied  in a mono- l ingua lmanner.
We have to separate, at least conceptual ly ,bi-lingual processings from mono-lingual processingswhich extract explicitly a set of factors deter-mining the surface structures of source texts.
In thetentat ive  f ramework  in Sect ion  2, the role of thetransfer  phase was  rest r ic ted to comput ing  factorsfor determin ing  target s t ructures  f rom factors ex-t racted f rom source texts inc lud ing their  sur facestructures.
We assumed there that a set of factorsfor determin ing  target sur face structures could becomputed  f rom those ext racted dur ing the ana lys isphase, though the computation itself was dependent onlanguage pairs.
The discussion in this section showsthat this assumption is not true.
The transfer phaseshould do more  than that.
The rev ised f ramework  isshown in Fig.

Though we adopt here the conven-tional division of phases in current transfer basedsystems, we do not claim that the three phase confi-gurat ion is the best and that these three phasesshould be executed in order.
Instead, we can think ofa system in which the 'understanding' phase extractsnot only factors determing surface source texts butalso factors for determining target structures.
Buteven so, we c la im that the unders tand ing  resu l ts  insuch a system have to be specific to language pairsand not language universal .

A Schematic View of Future MT Systems7 Layers of Understanding - Knowledge and TranslationThe fact that 'understanding texts' has beenunderstood d i f fe rent ly  by d i f fe rent  researchers  inNLU impl ies  that the 'knowledge' to wh ich  text  con-tents are to be related is different from one systemto another.
So far, quite different sorts of informa-tion prepared beforehand in systems have been called'knowledge'.
In Section 5, we discussed two differentapproaches to meanings of words which may lead us toquite different views of what 'knowledge' is: One isto relate mean ings  of words to extra- l ingu is t ic ,language independent concepts whose semantics are, inturn, given by certain theories (or formal systems),internal processing for specific tasks such as database accesses, problem solving, etc.
The other is todescribe core meanings of words by relating the wordsto a certa in set of pr imit ives.
The latter may beaugmented by adding further description using cogni-tive, s i tuat iona l  or other features (as noted inSect ion 6, some of these may be language dependent)in order to specify what families of objects/eventsthe words can descr ibe.
The knowledge descr ibed  bythis approach is essentially knowledge about possibleusages of words  and can be ut i l i zed  to t rans latewords of certain types or to make general inferenceson the s i tuat ions  described.
On the other hand,'knowledge' which is often mentioned in fields suchas knowledge engineering, expert systems and so forthrefers to knowledge of specific fields, and is moreeasi ly expressed  in the f irst approach.
These twoapproaches are quite opposite.
While the decomposi-tion approach tries to discover a single descriptionwhich covers possible usages of a word including itsmetaphor ica l  usages (the decompos i t iona l i s ts  mayc la im all usages are metaphor ical ) ,  the ext ra - l in -guist ic  concept  approach (the concept  approach,  inshort) tries to enumerate a set of concepts denotedby the word.
Whi le  the decompos i t ion  approachattempts to find internal structures of single words,the concept approach tends to identify even complexexpress ions  such as 'diagrams on the plane of thece lest ia l  equator' (note that this express ion  has as imple t rans lat ion  equ iva lent  in Japanese l ike'jizuhyou') as s ing le  concepts.
AS noted in Sect ion5, the concept  approach ,  wh ich  we there  ca l led  the'naive approach', cannot be used to express the wholemeaning of texts, but this does not imply that know-\].edge expressed by this approach is i rrelevant in MT.On the cont rary ,  it o f ten  happens  that we rea l i ze'lack of knowledge '  in sys tems,  when we f ind  re\]s-translat ions of terminologica l  words or when we findmisunderstandings  of source texts.Because  the decompos  it ion approach essent ia l lycaptures possible usages of words, it cannot decideappropr ia te  t rans la t ions  of te rmino log ica l  expres-s ions  by i tsel f .
Th is  is obv ious  because  even humant rans la tors  who  have enough knowledge  of languageusages often mis t rans la te  terminological  words.
Thesys tems or human t rans la tors  should  have knowledgeabout relat ionships between words and extra- l inguis-t ic concepts  in the sub jec t  f ie lds.
Because  suchrelatiorlships are a kind of conventions specif ic toeach sub jec t  f ie ld,  we s imp ly  have to know theseconventions.
Several current MT systems prepare cer-tain f rameworks  for treat ing such conventions of termt rans la t ions  spec i f i c  to ind iv idua l  sub jec t  field~:such as the f ie ld  code in the MU sys tems \ [Sakamoto\]984\],  the mic ro -g lossar ies  in PAHO's  sys tems\ [Vasconce l los  1985\] ,  h ie rarch ica l  organizat ions ofd ic t ionar ies  in GETA's sys tems \ [Bo i tet  1982\] ,  etc.However ,  though re la t ing  terminological  expressions(or words)  in d i f fe rent  languages  through ext ra -linguistic, language universal  concepts has become astandard way  of thinking in the field of terminologyand already adopted by several mult i - l ingual  termino-logy data  banks  (for example ,  \ [Goetscha lckx  1974\]),they do not expl ic i t ly  introduce the extra- l inguist icconcepts  in the i r  f rameworks  but  instead,  re la terather direct ly the terminological  words or expres-sions of the di f ferent languages.
(Uchida 1985\] c la ims that we have to introduceext ra - l ingu is t i c  concepts  even in MT sys tems,  be-cause ;(1) fu turn  MT sys tems shou ld  inc lude  not: on lyknowledge  of the cor respondence  of te rmino log ica lexpressions but also factual knowledge and knowledgeabout inference rules specif ic to the fields, etc.
(2) Such extra- l inguist ic  knowledge is language uni-versal, and, there fore ,  sbou\ ]d  be managed by  d i f -ferent f rameworks  from genera\], l inguist ic knowledgewhich  is l~mguage dependent.\[Boitet 1984\] shows how factual knowledge in aspec i f i c  sub jec t  f ie ld  can be u t i l i zed  to reso lvecer ta in  syntact i c  ambigu i t ies  such  as those  of thescope of coordinations, determinat ion of antecedentsof relat J  w~ c lauses  and pronouns ,  etc.
For  example ,he discusses that determin ing the correct scopes ofthe coordinat ions(i) dangerous \[cyanide and chlorine\] fumes(2) \[carbon and nitrogen tetraoxyde\]requires fatual knowledge of a specif ic level such as(3) cyanide fumes are dangerous(4) there  is no carbon  te t raoxyde  in normalchemistry.The sequences  of 'cyanide and ch lo r ine  fumes '  and'carbon an(\[ n i t rogen  te t raoxyde '  cou ld  not be d i f -ferentiated, if we used only a rough semant ic  classi-f i ca t ion  of nouns  such as be ing  the name of achemica l  etc.
(These examples ,  as Bo i te t  notes,cannot be correct ly interpreted by a s imple method  ofp re ference  semant ics . )
The necess i ty  of deta i ledfac tua l  knowledge  such as (3) and (4) is obv ious ,and, because such knowledge in chemist ry  is languageindependent, it should be represented in a languageun iversa l  manner .
Ext ra - l ingu is t i c  concepts shouldplay more important  roles than mere links among theterminological  terms of individual languages.However, a l though we complete ly  agree that extra-l inguist ic knowledge should play more important  rolesin future high qual i ty translat ion systems, we haveto be very care fu l  ill the in t roduct ion  of suchknowledge  into MT sys tems.
F i r s t  of all, as we haverepeated ly  c la imed,  the 'meanings '  ex t rac ted  f romsentences  that can be re la ted  to knowledge  of th iskind does not at all exhaust the informat ion con-veyed  by  sentences  that  need to be ' t ransfer red 'into target sentences.
Moreover, because sentenceseven in specif ic subject f ields consist of both ter-mino log ica l  te rms  and ord inary  words ,  we cannotexpect to express a\]I the results of understandingsuch sentences at the \]eve\].
of descr ipt ion using onlythe extra- l inguist ic  concepts.
We can only expect toexpress the understanding results of certain partsof sentences  at th is  level and check  whether  theunderstanding results of those parts are compat ib lewi th common sense knowledge of the specif ic field.
Inozher words, the process ing at this level cannot playthe main  ro le  ~n t rans la t ion  but  can on ly  p lay  someroles to prevent certain kinds of 'misunderstanding'.\[Boitet 1984\] notes this point as 'grafting on expertsystems ' .In addit ion to this, the boundary between ter-mino log ica l  terms and ordinary words is not so clear.When we res t r i c t  te rmino log ica l  te rms  to names  ofchemical  compounds, of mechanical  parts, etc., Ld\]eproblem of the boundary might  not appear so serious:but such restr ict ion <:'an lead to serious l imita-t ion on the ava i lab i l i ty  of knowledge  of  th i s  k indfor forming selectina\] restr ict ions necessary for thed isambiguat ion of source sentences.
If we at temp toextend  the range  of ' te rmino log ica l  terms' ,  theproblem of the boundary between terminologica l  termsand ordinary words arises.
For example, \[Hobbs 1984\]points out that, in a textbook on hepatitis, ordinarywords  such  as 'human', 'animal ' ,  'water', 'alcohol 'etc.
have specia l ized meanings di f ferent f rom thosein general  f ields;the concept denoted by 'human', inthis f ie ld,  is not a lower  concept  of the conceptdenoted by 'animal'.
We might then claim that thesetwo terms are terminologica l  terms of the f ield andthat the denoted  concepts  have cer ta in  res t r i c tedrelat ionships with the other concepts in the fields.A\] though such  se leet iona l  res t r i c t ionsspecia l ized in certain subject fields might  be veryuseful for resolv ing syntactic ambigu i t ies  of soursesentences ,  p rob lems here are how to f ind suchrestr icted usages of ordinary words  that are specif icto certain fields, how to clar i fy the possible rela-t ionsh ips  anlong 'concepts'  in those  f ie lds  ( toc reate  semant ic  mode ls  of the f ie lds) ,  etc.
As theabove  example  shows ,  even c la r i fy ing  the h ie rarchyamong concepts ,  wh ich  is one of the preva i l ingtechn iques  for o rgan iz ing  'knowledge '  in o rd inaryknowledge  representat ion  research ,  is not so easywhen we have  to deal  w i th  reasonab ly  la rge  sub jec tfields.
In order to uti l ize knowledge of this sortin the d lsambiguat ion pFocess, we have to encode notonly  such h ie rarch ica l  relat ionships among conceptsbut also many other kinds of factual knowledge about663those  concepts .
Be fore  c la iming  ' such-and-suchfac tua l  knowledge  can reso lve  cer ta in  spec i f i cambigui t ies  of given sentences', we have to developmethodo log ies  by which  we can systemat ica l ly  clarifya set of concepts  in the g iven  f ie lds  and there la t ionsh ips  among those  concepts ,  and can gatherfactual knowledge relevant to those concepts.The above  d i scuss ion  shows  that there  is not  ac lear  boundary  between te rmino log ica l  words  andord inary  words ;  but  ins tead,  there  is a cont inuousdistr ibut ion of words  f rom pure terminologica l  words,such as names  of  chemica l  compounds ,  at the oneext reme to pure  o rd inary  words  at the other.
Thoughthe pure termino log ica l  words have their own languageuniversal  def in i t ions and can be related direct ly toext ra - l ingu is t i c  concepts ,  the ord inary  words  haveonly their usages in individual languages and we haveto in fe r  the denoted  'concepts '  f rom the i r  usages.That is, as noted  before ,  the denoted  'concepts '  ofo rd inary  words  are language in terna l  and cannot  bere la ted  d i rec t ly  to ext ra - l ingu is t i c  concepts .
The-select ional restr ict ions wh ich  ord inary  words  have,there fore ,  can on ly  be captured  by spec i fy ing  whatevents/objects can be descr ibed by those words, andthat speci f icat ion might  be language dependent.Some of the di f f icul t ies in MT are caused by thefact that most  of the words  in cer ta in  sub jec tfields, even words  which are usually taken as part ofthe termino logy of those fields, are in-between thetwo extremes, and sentences usual ly contain words  atvarious posi t ions in the distribution.
For example, asentence such as(5) The mix ture  g ives  of f  dangerous  cyan ide  andchlorine fumesconta ins  two  pure  te rmino log ica l  words  (i.e.,cyan ide ,  ch lo r ine) ,  two  ord inary  words  (i.e., 'togive', 'to be dangerous') and two intermediate typesof words  (i.e.
'fume', 'mixture').

As selec-t ina l  res t r i c t ions  for d i sambiguat ion ,  we have tohave fac tua l  knowledge  of the f ie lds  (for res t r i c -t ions  among termino log ica l  words) ,  res t r i c t ionsspec i f ied  by  us ing  cogn i t ive ,  s i tuat iona l  or o therfeatures  (for res t r i c t ions  among ord inary  words  --deep case f rames w i th  semant ic  restr ict ions on casefillers, which are speci f ied in the verb dictionary,are one of the typical  techniques found in current MTsys tems)  and  var ied  sor ts  of mix tures  of these  twoext remes .
On the o ther  hand,  for the se lec t ion  ofappropr ia te  ta rget  word  se lec t ion ,  we have  to haveseveral kinds of 'transfer' mechan ism using di f ferentsor ts  of in fo rmat ion  such  as ext ra - l ingu is t i cconcepts  wh ich  l ink  the words  of ind iv idua l  lan-guages, d is t inguish ing features for descr ibed events-/objects, and so on.The s i tuat ion becomes even more compl icated dueto the fact that a single word has often both specia-l ized usages and general usages, even if we restr ictour domain  of t ranslat ion to certain l imited areas.The  f rameworks  wh ich  cur rent  MT sys temsprov ide ,  such  as semant ic  features ,  sub jec t  f ie \ ]dcodes,  mic ro -g lossar ies  spec i f i c  to the f ie lds,h ierarchica l ly  o rgan ized  d ic t ionar ies ,  etc., cannot664- capture  the  in terw ined  re la t ionsh ips  betweenordinary words and terminologica l  words, and betweenusage s specia l ized in fields and general  usages.We have to emphas ize  that there  is no s ing lelayer  of 'unders tand ing '  exc lus ive ly  re levant  totranslation; only mutua l ly  related layers of under-s tand ing  rang ing  f rom deta i led  unders tand ing  (re-la ted  to fac tua l  knowledge  in the f ield) to thevague  and genera l  unders tand ing  of s i tuat ions .

There fore ,  we need acertain descr ipt ive f ramework  in which we can expressthese various sorts of factors and from wh ich  we canre t r ieve  such factors.
Annotated  t ree  s t ruc turessuch as those  used  in the MU sys tems,  GETA, METALetc.

Though Kay's notat ion  inun i f i ca t ion  grammar  \[Kay 1984\] is obv iuos ly  one ofthe candidate frameworks, it is appropr iate only fordescr ibing interpretat ions which  have already deter-mined by the analysis phase.

Texhn iques  for shar ing  a par t ia ldescr ipt ion at a certain level by several di f ferentdescr ipt ions at d i f ferent levels and for mainta in ingthe consistency of descr ipt ion when some parts of itare changed should be developed.\[Problem 2\] (Integration of  Unders tand ing  Levels)  Asd i scussed  in Sect ion  7, we  shou ld  be ab le  tointegrate several d i f ferent levels of 'understanding'w i th  l ingu is t i c  leve ls  of descr ip t ion .
Thedescr ipt ive f rameworks  developed so far have confinedthemse lves  to e i ther  l ingu is t i c  leve ls  or to one ofthe specif ic understanding levels.
Kay's uni f icat iongrammar ,  LFG, GPSG etc.
are al l  concerned  w i th  thedescr ip t ion  of  l ingu is t i c  levels.
A l l  o f  them, forexample, treat surface words as pr imi t ive  units.
Onthe other hand, most researches in NLU aim to relatetexts to certain extra- l inguist ic  knowledge so thatthe final understanding results are expressed inde-pendent ly from their l inguist ic source structures.
Ino rder  to in tegrate  unders tand ing  resu l t s  w i th  thetranslat ion proccess, we need further researches toc la r i fy  not  only  what  leve ls  of unders tand ing  arereal ly re\].evant to translat ion but also how we are tocoord inate  such  d ivers i f ied  leve ls  of  p rocess ingcomputat iona I ly.\[Problem 3\] ( Incompleteness of Texts and 'Knowledge ' -Robustness  of P rocess ing)  IIuman t rans la tors  cantranslate 'I'll come tomorrow' into Japanese without:any knowledge about the social re lat ionships of thespeaker  and the hearer .
They w i l l  t rans la te  thesentence  based  on the de fau l t  assumpt ion  that there la t ionsh ip  is neutra l .
It usua l ly  happens  that,even for human translators, certain factors relevantto the detc~rmination of target structures cannot beobtained because of the incompleteness of texts andlack of necessary  knowledge .
The sys tem shou ld  beable to determine  the most  feas ib le  t rans la t ionsbased on the incomplete factors extracted f rom soui-cetexts.
Though es tab l i sh ing  sets  of fac tors  w~ichcol lect iw~ly determine the surface structures of thesource and target languages may faci l i tate systemat iccont ras t ive  s tud ies  of the two  languages  and makepresent  ad -hoc  t rans fer  phase  c leaner ,  we have  tonote that actual systems cannot a\].ways extract suchfac tors  f rom the source  texts.
Even in fu turesys tems,  we wi l l  have  to prepare  heur i s t i c  gu idedtransfer procedures based on lower  leve l  factors ,such as syntact i c  s t ruc tures ,  a lone.
That  is, theidea of 'safety nets' is ind ispensab\ ]  e, howeverintel l igent the future MT system might be.

These rules area kind of heur ist ic  but are not l inguist ical ly  we l l -founded.
For this kind of processing, we may have tointroduce other kinds of knowledge, for example, theexpert knowledge of profess ional  translators \[Tucker1985 \] .\ [P rob lem 41 (Easy Accomodat ion  of Future Deve lopmentof Theories) As noted in Section 3, we cannot expectto have a complete set of factors wh ich  carl uniquelydetermine  the sur face  syntact i c  s t ruc tures  of alanguage.
Becauese there is always poss ib i l i ty  thatfuture l inguist ic  research will reveal factors whichhave not yet been noticed, the computat ional  frame-work  shou ld  be f lex ib le  enough for accomodat ingthese  fac tors .
In th i s  sense,  to commit  s t rong ly  toone l ingu is t i c  theory  at p resent  seems dangerousfor computat iona l  f rameworks .
Fur thermore ,  thoughmost  l inguist ic theories aim to descr ibe l inguist ics t ruc tures  f rom a mono- l ingua l  po in t  of v iew,  thefactors to be extracted from source texts depends onthe target language.
Some of the factors relevant tot ranslat ion can only be clar i f ied through bi-\].ingual,cont ras t ive  s tud ies  of the two languages  and byreferr ing to the aspects of 'understanding' which areobv ious ly  beyond the scope of cur rent  l ingu is t i ctheor ies .
We \]lave to note that  the computat iona lf rameworks  for mach ine translat ion should be f lexibleenough for treat ing various sorts of phenomena whichcurrent l inguist ic theories do not cover.\ [P rob lem 5\] (Other Factors  to be Accomodated  -D iscourse  Factors ,  Cogn i t ive  Factors )  The computa -tional researches in discourse analysis so far haveput  emphas is  on a cer ta in  set of top ics ,  such asreso lu t ions  of anaphor ic  express ions ,  recover ingspeakers '  in tent ion  f rom ut terances ,  etc.
A l thoughthese  are more  or less re levant  to high qua l i tyt rans la t ion  in the future, we have to a t tack  muchw ider  ranges  of p rb \ ]ems concerned  w i th  d i scousephenomena, that is, what kinds of discourse factorsare relevant to the determinat ion of surface sentences ty les  and in what  manner.
Though re levant  top icshave been treated in text l inguist ics and many usefulideas have been proposed already, many of them seemto be too vague  to formalJ, ze computat iona l ly .
It ist ime to fin(\] computatJorlal formal izat ion for themand to integrate them wi th  translat ion processes.
MTis one of the most  promis ing  appl icat ion fields wherethe research  resu l t s  in text l ingu is t i cs  cou ld  beutil ized.\[ Ishiwata 1985\] discusses how cognit ive featuresare relevant to translation, especial ly word transla-tion.
By tak ing the F rench  verb  'tomber'  and theJapanese  t rans la t ion  equ iva lents  ' taoreru '  and'ochJru' as a typical example, he shows that certainmovements  or ob jec ts  wh ich  carl be expressed  by theverb ' tomber'  in F rench  shou ld  be descr ibed  d i f -fe rent ly  by us ing  e i ther  'taoreru' or 'ochiru'.
Hisclaim \]s that such select ion of target word dependson how the speaker  recogn ize  the movements  ofob jects ,  that  is, whether  the mot ion  J s ra therperpend icu la r  (i.e.
the s tone  fa\] is) or not  (i.e.
theman fell over).
That is, the select ion of appropr iateJapaneses  verbs  depend on a cer ta in  k ind of 'image'\]eve\] unders tand ing  of the event  whJ ch the F renchverb describes.
Whether such levels of understandingcarl be represented  in a symbol  ic manner ,  and whatkinds of such symbol ic  cognit ive features are neces-sary, whether  there  is a set of cogn i t ive  featureswhich is effect ive for any language pair, and so onare, of course,  research  top ics  in the d i s tantfuture.
However,  we }lave to note that such cognit ivelevels  of features  are more  use fu l  than  ext ra - l in -guistic know\].edge in specif ic subject fields, forthe cho ice  of appropr ia te  ta rget  equ iva lents  forwords with wide usages.\ [P rob lem 6\] (Set t ing  Layers  of 'Understand ing ' )  Asd i scussed  in Sect ion  6 and 7, we can d i s t ingu ish  atleast  the two ext reme layers  of unders tand ing  andknowledge relevant to MT.
Whether these two kinds ofunders tand ing  and knowledge  can be represented  Jns ing le  f rameworks ,  \]low they  shou ld  be coord inatedw i th  l ingu is t i c  p rocess ing  (analys is ,  t ransfer ,generat ion)  computat iona\ ] \ ] .y ,  to what  extent  thesekinds of knowledge can real ly be encoded in systems,etc.
have to be c lar i f ied .
If tho two  k inds  ofknowledge should be represented separately, we haveto clarify hew many dif ferent layers exists and \]lowthey should be mutual ly  related.We have l isted above some of the prob lems causedby the pecul iar i ty  of MT that we cannot determine inadvance a certain concrete level of 'understanding'.The other pecul iar i t ies of MT come from the fact thatMT sys tems have to t reat  documents  of much  w idersub jec t  f ie lds  and of much  more  var ied  text typesthan o ther  app l i ca t ions .
Our Mu sys tems,  forexample, restr ict  the document  type to abstracts ofsc ient i f i c  and  techno log ica l  papers  but t reatsc ient i f i c  f ie lds  in genera\]..
The PAHO's sys temst rans la te  documents  in more  res t r i c ted  f ie lds  butinclude very wide ranges of document  types, includingconference  repor ts ,  budget  p roposa ls ,  l e t te rs  etc.665This fact, in combinat ion  with the d i f f i cu l ty  ofse t t ing  the unders tand ing  leve l ,  causes  manypractical diff iculties.\[Problem 7\] (Complexities of Semantic Models) Widersubject fields imply more complex i t ies  in semant icmodels.
In data base access, one only  has to dealw i th  a s imp le  set of semant ic  c lasses such as 'nameof companies' ,  'person's name', 'salary', etc.
andtheir  poss ib le semant ic  re lat ionships.
However ,  as\[Bennet 1985\] notes'the thought of writing complex models of even onecomplete technical domain is staggering: one set ofmanuals we have worked with --- is part of a documentcollection that is expected to comprise some i00,000pages.
A typical NLP research group would not even beable to read that  vo lume of manual ,  much less wr i tethe necessary  semant ic  models, in any reasonab leamount of time',we have to treat much more complex semantic fields inMT.
We have to deve lop  methodo log ies  to c lar i fy  thestructures of such complex semantic models systemati-cally for any given subject field.\ [Problem 8\] ( Instabi l i ty  of Lexica l  Coding) w idersubject  f ie lds  imply  a large amount  of vocabulary,and high quality translation requires rich informa-tion to be coded for each lexical  item.
This  meansthat we need many lexicographers for lexical coding,and the problem of consistency arises.
High semanticcomplexities imply that criteria for lexical codingare not so evident.
In the MU project,  we preparedrather detailed manuals for lexical coding but theyare still not sufficient for obtaining good qualitycodings.
The semant ic  codes, for example,  are oftendependent  on indiv idual  lex icographers  and suchincons is tency  caused  many troubles in g rammardevelopment and also depressing translation errors.The prob lem of ins tab i l i ty  is not found not only insemantic coding but also in every other descriptionitems in the dictinary, when codings are perforlaed bymany people.
We have to deve lop not only f lex ib lesof tware tools for fac i l i ta t ing  lexical  coding andcons is tency chek ing \[ Kogure 1984\] \[Boitet 1982 \] butalso effective linguistic checking procedures.\ [Problem 9\] (Weak Semant ic  Constra ints)  The lack ofconcrete in terna l  p rocess ing  for specif ic  tasksimplies that the system cannot reject nonsense inter-pretations of input sentences.
In other applications,certain syntactic interpretations are judged as non-sense when the internal processing cannot give anymeaningful semantics to them.
Furthermore, as Hobbsnoted by the examples  of 'to produce', w ide subjectf ields imply  that var ious  usages of words  wh ichshare a core mean ing  in common wi l l  appear  intexts.
That is, many usages which have metaphoricalflavors ('The car drinks gas' is a well-known examplegiven by \[Wilks 1972\]) wi l l  commonly appear in textsand make the rejection of syntactic interpretationson semant ic  grounds harder.
In the MU systems,  weprepared about 50 semantic categories for nouns, butmost of them are not as effective as we had expectedfor p revent ing  'nonsense' interpretat ions,  thoughthey are e f fect ive  for certa in kinds of semant icin terpreta t ion  (for example,  for deep case inter-\]gretations of p repos i t iona l  phrases  wh ich  are not::strictly governed by their  predicates)  and targetword selection to some extent.
AS noted in Section 7,though Wilks' idea of 'preferent ia l  semant ics '  is666one of the possible solutions, we have to coordinatethis idea with the other kinds of processing and wi%npreferences of other levels.\ [Problem I0\] (Ma inta inab i l i ty  of Systems) In thed iscuss ion  of \ [Problem 3\] , we c la imed that thet ransfer  component  shou ld  be robust  and be able tocompute the most feasible factors relevant to targets t ructure  determinat ion ,  even if necessary  factorscannot be given by the analysis phase.
The same lineof discussion can be applied to the entire process ofMT.
The analys is  phase, for example,  cannot expectthat a ful l  set of necessary  in fo rmat ion  for inter-p re ta t ion  of input sentences wi l l  a lways  be acces-sible.
This imp l ies  that, at each phase of t rans la -tion, a certain number of rules, which are a kind ofheuristics and not theoretically well-founded, shouldbe prepared.
Furthermore, to deal with wide subjectfields implies that we have to treat varied types ofl inguist ic  phenomena,  which again requ i res  a largenumber  of rules in those systems.
Wider  f ields a lsoincrease ambiguities at each level of intepretation.A single word may have several  d i f fe rent  par t -o f -speech interpretat ions ,  to each of wh ich  severald i f fe rent  syntact ic  features may be assg ined (forexample, a verb often have several different surfacecase patterns).
This d i f f i cu l ty  can be avo ided  tosome extent in other applications because we can fixcerta in levels  of in terpreta t ion  in advance (forexample,  'ship' may only be used as a noun in acertain data base access system, though it has a verbinterpretat ion).
In order to prevent  the pro l i fe ra -tion of possible syntactic interpretation in MT, weneed a certain number of disambiguation rules whichare also heuristic based \[Tsujii 1984\].
In short, wehave to manage a large number of rules whose mutualre la t ionsh ips  are t ighter  than those found in mostother rule based expert  systems.
We have to deve lopnot only flexible software systems for managing suchlarge rule based sys tems \[Johnson 1984\] \ [Nakamura1986\]  but  a l so  methodo log ies  by wh ich  we cansystematically organize and integrate  knowledge  ofquite different sorts.9 ConclusionsIn this paper, we have concentrated on problemsconcerned  wi th  'understanding and t rans lat ion '  andhave tr ied to c lar i fy  that the aspects  of 'under-standing' relevant to MT are different from those inconvent iona l  NLU researches  and their  app l i ca t ionfields.
The relation~ships between linguistic expres-sions and their unders tand ing  resul ts  are not ass t ra ight fo rward  as most  researchers  in NLU haveassumed.
Though most researches in NLU have focusedon single aspects of understanding which are definedby 'internal processing', we have to treat almost allaspects  of 'understanding texts' in MT, wh ich  aremutua l ly  in ter tw ined  in a compl i ca ted  manner  andhave to be in tegrated into single computat iona l lyunified frameworks.
Though this is an extremely hardtask, the difficulties seem to be deeply related bothto 'understanding texts' in a true sense and to theessent ia l  p roper t ies  of natura l  language.
We wou ldalso like to claim that it is time to integrate thesetwo f ie lds  wi th  the i r  d i f fe rent  h i s to r ies  anddifferent techniques, MT and NLU, and so to start toclarify what 'understanding texts' really means.AcknowledgementsAl though the views expressed in this paper are myown, I wou ld  l ike to thank  my co l leagues  of  the Mu-p ro jec t  who are engaged in deve lop ing  the ac tua lsystems.
