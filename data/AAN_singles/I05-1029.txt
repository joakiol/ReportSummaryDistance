Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005Analogy as Functional Recategorization: Abstractionwith HowNet SemanticsTony VealeDepartment of Computer Science, University College Dublin,Belfield, D4, Dublin, IrelandTony.Veale@UCD.iehttp://www.cs.ucd.ie/staff/tveale.htmlAbstract.
One generally accepted hallmark of creative thinking is an ability tolook beyond conventional labels and recategorize a concept based on its behav-iour and functional potential.
So while taxonomies are useful in any domain ofreasoning, they typically represent the conventional label set that creative think-ing attempts to look beyond.
So if a linguistic taxonomy like WordNet [1] is tobe useful in driving linguistic creativity, it must support some basis for recate-gorization, to allow an agent to reorganize its category structures in a way thatunlocks the functional potential of objects, or that recognizes similarity betweenliterally dissimilar ideas.
In this paper we consider how recategorization can beused to generate analogies using the HowNet [2] ontology, a lexical resourcelike WordNet that in addition to being bilingual (Chinese/English) also providesexplicit semantic definitions for each of the terms that it defines.1   IntroductionAnalogy is a knowledge-hungry process that exploits a conceptual system?s ability toperform controlled generalization in one domain and re-specialization into another.The result is a taxonomic leap within an ontology that transfers semantic content fromone term onto another.
While all taxonomies allow vertical movement, a system mustfully understand the effects of generalization on a given concept before any analogyor metaphor can be considered either deliberate or meaningful.
So to properly supportanalogy, a taxonomy must provide a basis of abstracting not just to conventional cate-gories, like Person, Animal or Tool, but to categories representing the specific causalbehaviour of concepts such as think-agent, pain-experiencer, cutting-instrument, andso on.
Thus, a surgeon can be meaningfully described as a repairman since both occu-pations have the function of restoring an object to an earlier and better state; a foot-baller can be meaningfully described as a gladiator or a warrior since each exhibitscompetitive behaviour; and a scalpel can be compared to a sabre, a sword or a cleaversince each has a cutting behaviour; and so on.Theories of metaphor and analogy are typically based either on structure-mapping[3,4] or on abstraction e.g., [5,6,7,8,9,10]).
While the former is most associated withanalogy, the latter has been a near-constant in the computational treatment of meta-phor.
Structure-mapping assumes that the causal behaviour of a concept is expressedin an explicit, graph-theoretic form so that unifying sub-graph isomorphisms can beAnalogy as Functional Recategorization: Abstraction with HowNet Semantics 327found between different representations.
In contrast, abstraction theories assume thatanalogous concepts, even when far removed in ontological terms, will nonethelessshare a common hypernym that captures their causal similarity.
Thus, we should ex-pect an analogous pairing like surgeon and butcher to have different immediate hy-pernyms but to ultimately share an abstraction like cutting-agent (see [8,9]).However, the idea that a standard ontology will actually provide a hypernym likecutting-agent seems convenient almost to the point of incredulity.
The problem is, ofcourse, that as much as we want our ontologies to anticipate future analogies andmetaphors with these pro-active categorizations, most ontologies simply do not pos-sess terms as prescient as these.
This is the question we address in this paper: if weassume that our ontologies lack these structures, can we nonetheless enable them tobe added via automatic means?
We argue that we can, by generalizing not on thebasis of a concept?s taxonomic position but on the basis of the specific relations thatdefine its causal behaviour.Clearly then, this approach to analogy requires a resource that is rich in causal rela-tions.
We find this richness in HowNet [2, 11], a bilingual lexical ontology for Chi-nese and English that employs an explicit propositional semantics to define each of itslexical concepts.With this goal in mind, the paper observes the following structure: in section twowe offer a concise survey of the considerable research that has, in the past, been dedi-cated to abstraction theories of analogy and metaphor.
In section three we then com-pare and contrast WordNet [1] and HowNet as candidate resources for the currentabstraction approach to analogical reasoning.
In section four, having established anargument as to why HowNet is to be preferred, we indicate how HowNet?s semanticdefinitions can be transformed in the service of analogical recategorization.
The per-formance and competence of this recategorization ability is then evaluated in sectionfive.
Speculation about further possible contributions of HowNet to analogical re-search is reserved for the closing remarks of section six.2   Abstraction Theories of AnalogyThat analogy and metaphor operate across multiple levels of conceptual abstractionhas been well known since classical times.
Aristotle first provided a compelling taxo-nomic account of both in his Poetics (see [5], for a translation), and computationalistshave been fascinated by this perspective ever since.
While the core idea has survivedrelatively unchanged, one must discriminate theories that apparently presume a statictype-hierarchy to be sufficient for all abstraction purposes (e.g., [6]), from theoriesthat posit the need for a dynamic type hierarchy (e.g., [7, 8]).
One must also differen-tiate theories that have actually been implemented (e.g., [6,8,9]) from those that areeither notional or that seem to court computational intractability (e.g., [5,6]).
Perhapsmost meaningfully, one must differentiate theories and implementations that assumehand-crafted, purpose-built ontologies (e.g., [6]) from those that exploit an existinglarge-scale resource like WordNet (e.g., [8,9]).
In the former, one has the flexibility tosupport as many functional abstractions like cutting-agent as are believed necessary,but at the cost of appearing to anticipate future analogies by hand-crafting them intothe system.328 T.

1.
Analysis of the WordNet gloss for {Athena} suggests that the word-form ?wisdom?
hasanalogical potential, since it is alignable with another use in {Ganesh}.
This leads to the con-struction of the dynamic sense {Wisdom_deity} which can be used to make analogical leapsbetween these concepts.This current work follows the latter course.
We intend to automatically construct anew taxonomy of analogically-useful abstractions like cutting-agent, by analysing thesemantic content of the definitions assigned to each word-sense in HowNet.
Past work(e.g., [8]) has attempted this automatic construction of analogically-friendly taxono-mies from WordNet, resulting in an approach that involves as much information-extraction from free text as it does semantic inference.
This is because WordNet?sglosses, unlike the semantic definitions of HowNet, are free-form sentences designedfor human, rather than machine, consumption.
For instance, Figure 1 above illustrateshow features can be lifted from WordNet glosses to create new intermediatetaxonyms, or dynamic types, from which subsequent abstraction-based analogies canbe generated.The explicitly-structured semantic forms that one finds in HowNet definitions willclearly make this lifting of features more logical and less heuristic.
In general, thismakes HowNet an ideal knowledge-source for a computational model of metaphorand analogy (e.g., see [10] for a topical perspective).3   Comparing WordNet and HowNetGeneralization can be considered ?controlled?
if, when moving to a higher level ofabstraction in a taxonomy, a conceptual system is able to precisely quantify thatmeaning which is lost.
In this sense at least, most large-scale taxonomies do not pro-vide a significant degree of control.
Perhaps nowhere is this observation more keenlyfelt than in weak lexical ontologies like Princeton WordNet (PWN).
In PWN [1],generalization of a concept/synset does not generally yield a functional or behaviouralabstraction of the original concept.
This is so because WordNet?s taxonomy is de-signed not to capture common causality, function and behaviour, but to show howAnalogy as Functional Recategorization: Abstraction with HowNet Semantics 329existing lexemes relate to each other.
For example, the common abstraction thatunites {surgeon, sawbones} and {tree_surgeon} is not a concept that captures ashared sense of repair, improvement or care, but {person, human}.
To be fair, muchthe same must be said of other taxonomies, even that of HowNet [2,11], a Chi-nese/English semantic dictionary, and Cyc [12].
However, as we shall demonstrate,HowNet contains the necessary basis for such abstractions in its relational semanticdefinitions.PWN and HowNet have each been designed according a different theory of seman-tic organization.
PWN is differential is nature: rather than attempting to express themeaning of a word explicitly, PWN instead differentiates words with different mean-ings by placing them in different synsets, and further differentiates synsets from oneanother by assigning them to different positions in its ontology.
In contrast, HowNetis constructive in nature, exploiting sememes from a less discriminating taxonomythan PWN?s to compose a semantic representation of meaning for each word sense.Nonetheless, HowNet compensates strongly with its constructive semantics.
Forexample, HowNet assigns the concept surgeon|?
?the following definition:{human|?:HostOf={Occupation|??},domain={medical|?},{doctor|??
:agent={~}}}which can be glossed thus: ?a surgeon is a human with an occupation in the medicaldomain who acts as the agent of a doctoring activity.?
The {~} serves as a self-reference here, to mark the location of the concept being defined in the given seman-tic structure.
The oblique reference offered by the tilde construct serves to make thedefinition more generic (thereby facilitating analogy), so that many different conceptscan conceivably employ the same definition.
Thus, HowNet uses the above definitionnot only for surgeon, but for medical workers in general, from orderlies to nurses tointernists and neurologists.4   Extracting Functional StructureOur scheme for converting HowNet?s constructive definitions into a more differentialform hinges on the use of the tilde as a self-reference in relational structures.
Forinstance, consider the semantic definition that HowNet gives to repairman|???:{human|?:HostOf={Occupation|??
}, {repair|??
:agent={~}}}Noting the position of {~} here, we can infer that a repairman is the agent of a repair-ing activity, or in differential terms, a repair-agent.
Now, since HowNet defines re-pair|??
as a specialization of the reinstatement activity resume|?
?, we can furtherestablish repair-agent as a specialization of resume-agent.resume-agentrepair-agent  doctor-agent  amend-agentrepairman|???

Portion of a three-level functional hierarchy derived from HowNet330 T. VealeThis double layer of abstraction establishes a new taxonomy that organizes word-concepts according to their analogical potential, rather than their formal ontologicalproperties.
For instance, as shown in Figure 2, resume-agent encompasses not onlyrepair-agent, but doctor-agent, since HowNet alo defines the predicate doctor|?
?as a specialization of the predicate resume|?
?.In general, given a semantic fragment F:role={~} in  a HowNet definition, we cre-ate the new abstractions F-role and F?-role, where F?
is the immediate hypernym of F.The role in question might be agent, instrument, location, patient, or any other rolethat HowNet supports.
By way of example, Figure 3 illustrates a partial hierarchyderived from the HowNet semantics of various form-altering tools:AlterForm- instrumentcut-instrument       stab-instrument split-instrument    dig-instrumentknife|?

?5   Evaluating Analogical CompetenceWe evaluate the analogical potential of the newly derived functional taxonomy usingfour criteria: topology ?
the branching structure of the new taxonomy dictates itsability to generate analogies; coverage ?
the percentage of unique HowNet definitionsthat can be functionally re-indexed in the new taxonomy; recall ?
the percentage ofunique definitions for which at least one analogy can be found using the new taxon-omy; and parsimony?
the percentage of abstractions in the new taxonomy that can beused to generate analogies.5.1   Topological Characteristics of the New Functional TaxonomyThe new functional taxonomy contains 1579 mid-level abstractions and 838 upper-levelabstractions.
In total, the taxonomy contains only 2219 unique abstractions, revealingthat in 8% of cases, the upper-level abstraction of one concept serves as the upper-levelabstraction of another.Analogies will be generated only if two or more unique concept definitions are co-indexed under the same mid-level or upper-level abstraction in the new functionaltaxonomy.
For example, knight|??
and gladiator.|???
are both co-indexeddirectly under the mid-level abstraction fight-agent.
Likewise, gladiator|???
isindexed under HaveContest-agent via fight-agent, while footballer|????
?isindexed under HaveContest-agent via compete-agent.
The upper-level of abstraction,represented here by HaveContest-agent, is necessary to facilitate analogy betweensemantically distant concepts.Nonetheless, we note that a certain degree of metaphoric licence has already beenexercised by HowNet?s designers in assigning semantic structures, so that even se-mantically distant concepts can still share the same mid-level abstraction.

can, as shown in Figure 4, be understood via asingle generalization.Analogy as Functional Recategorization: Abstraction with HowNet Semantics 331MakeBad-agentkill-agent   attack-agentassassin|??

Semantic diversity among concepts with the same mid-level abstractionFurthermore, because HowNet contains 95,407 unique lexical concepts (excludingsynonyms) but only 23,507 unique semantic definitions, these definitions must beunder-specified to the extent that many are shared by non-identical concepts (e.g.,cart|?
?and bicycle|?
?, are simply defined as manual vehicles).5.2   Analogical CoverageSince this new taxonomy is derived from the use of {~} in HowNet definitions, boththe coverage and recall of analogy generation crucially depend on the widespread useof this reflexive construct.
However, of the 23,505 unique definitions in HowNet, just6430 employ thus form of self-reference.
The coverage of the new taxonomy is thus27% of HowNet definitions.5.3   Analogical RecallA majority of the abstractions in the new taxonomy, 59%, serve to co-index two ormore HowNet definitions.
Overall, analogies are generated for 6184 unique HowNetdefinitions, though these individual definitions may have many different lexical reali-zations.
The recall rate thus is 26% of HowNet?s 23,507 unique definitions, or 96% ofthe 6430 HowNet definitions that make use of {~}.
The most productive abstraction iscontrol_agent, which serves to co-index 210 unique definitions.5.4   Parsimony of RecallOverall, 1,315 of the 2219 nodes in the new taxonomy prove useful in co-indexingtwo or more unique definitions, while 904 nodes serve to index just a single defini-tion.
The parsimony of the new taxonomy is thus 59%, which reveals a reasonable, ifnot ideal, level of representational uniformity across HowNet?s semantic definitions.6   Conclusions and Future WorkWhile just 27% of HowNet?s definitions are sufficiently structured to support anal-ogy, we are encouraged that almost all of this generative potential can be achievedwith a new functional taxonomy that is straightforward and efficient to construct.Furthermore, though 27% may seem slim, these analogically-friendly {~} structuresare concentrated in the areas of the HowNet taxonomy that can most benefit fromanalogical re-description.
As revealed in Table 1 below, some areas of HowNet areclearly more amenable to analogical reasoning than others.332 T. VealeTable 1.
Analogical coverage/recall for different areas of HowNetHumans Artefacts Animals OverallCoverage .65 .68 .42 .27Recall .54 .58 .16 .26Parsimony .50 .54 .22 .59But the analogical potential of HowNet resides not just in its explicit propositionalsemantics, but in its use of Chinese orthography.
Consider that most Chinese entriesin HowNet are multi-character terms, where each character is not so much a letter as amorpheme.
.
For instance, ??
?, meaning ?scalpel?, is a composite not just of char-acters but of ideas, for ?
?means ?surgery?
and ?
means ?knife?.
This logographiccompositionality affords a kind of semantic transparency on a scale that alphabeticwriting systems (like that of English) simply can not match Thus, ??
?, whichtranslates as ?philosopher?, can be seen via HowNet as a composition of ??(?phi-losophy?)
and ?
(?specialist?
or ?scientist?).
In turn, philosophy|?
?is organizedby HowNet as a specialization of knowledge|?
?, as is logic|?
?, mathematics|?
?, lexicography|??
?and even midwifery|???.
By decomposing com-pound terms in this way and generalizing the extracted modifiers, yet another three-level taxonomy can be constructed.
For instance, from these examples the partialtaxonomy of Fig.
5 can be derived.Knowledge-humanMathematics-human       philosophy-human midwifery-humanmathematician|???
philosopher|???
midwife|??Fig.
5.
Portion of a three-level hierarchy derived from compound Chinese termsThe analogical potential of this ontologization becomes clear when one notices thatit supports the classical analogy of philosopher as midwife.
Clearly, then, we havejust scratched the surface of what can usefully be derived from the lexico-semanticcontent of HowNet.
Our current investigations with HowNet suggest that the fullsemantic richness of Chinese orthography may yet play a considerable role in sup-porting creative reasoning at a linguistic level, if only because it opens a window ontoa different cultural perspective on words and concepts.References1.
