Language and Reasoning for Question Answering:State of the Art and Future DirectionsFarah BenamaraInstitut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse118, route de Narbonne, 31062 Toulouse, Francebenamara@irit.frAbstractThe research community states that QAsystems should support the integration ofdeeper modes of language understand-ing as well as more elaborated reason-ing schemas in order to boost the perfor-mances of current QA systems as well asthe quality and the relevance of the pro-duced answers.Depending on the complexity of the ques-tion and the associated passages, more orless complex strategies can be used, suchas :?
deep semantic analysis of NL ques-tions such as anaphora resolutions,?
context and ambiguity detection,?
responses to unanticipated questionsor to resolve situations in which noanswer is found in the data sources,?
models for answer completeness,?
dialogue and interactive QA scenario,?
models for answer fusion from differ-ent sources, etc.We focus in this talk on the role of rea-soning in a QA process by answering thefollowing questions: what kind of reason-ing capabilities can be used ?
on what kindof resources can they be built on ?
at whatextend they can be used when developingrealistic systems ?Based on the synthesis of the current stateof the art, the second part of the talk de-scribes a general typology of inference atdifferent levels: deep semantic analysis ofboth NL questions and passages, textualentailment, pragmatic inference and con-text detection, etc.
The related formalismsas well as a description of some currentQA systems based on these techniques arealso presented.1 KRAQ06
