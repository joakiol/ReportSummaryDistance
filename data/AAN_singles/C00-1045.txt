Both accounts ay that thedetermination of tile tbcus depends on syntac-tic as well as pragmatic factors, but have notbeen able to pin those factors down.
In thispaper, we uncover the major factors which de-termine the focus set in descriptive texts.
Thisnew tbcus definition has been ew, luated with re-spect to two corporm museum exhibit labels,mid newspaper mtieles.
It provides an opera-tionalizable basis for pronoun production, andhas been implemented as the reusable modulegnome-np.
The algorithm l)ehind gnome-np isconlpared with the most recent pronoun gener-ation algorithm of McCoy and Strube (1999).1 In t roduct ionBesides the well established problem of ln'onounresolution, pronoun generation is now attract-ing renewed attention.
In the past, generationsystelns generated pronouns without attachingmuch importance to the problem, one notableexception being the classical algorithm of Dale(1990), loosely based on centering theory.
Withthe emergence of corpus based studies in comtm-rational linguistics, the question arises whetherit is possible to refine known standard algo-rithms, or whether an improvement is only tobe achieved with the hell) of world knowledgereasoning - a matter too complex to be dealtwith reliably at this time.
Tile Ibrlner directionis represented by tile pioneering work of McCoyand Strube (1999).
They propose a refined algo-rithm for tile choice between definite descriptionon the one hand and pronoun on the other for* The work reported in this paper has been calmed outwith the tinancial support of UK ESPllC grant L51126.animate referents I , which is based on distancGtime structure mid ambiguity constraints.Here we introduce a more general algoritlnnfor the pronominalization decision that is validnot only for animate but for inanimate referentsas well.
In conformity with McCoy and Strube,we group noun phrases with definite determinerand proper nalnes together under tile term "det'-inite description".
The algorithm proposes anew pronominalization strategy, which beyondMcCoy and Strube (1999)'s criteria makes useof the discom'se status of the antecedent andparallelism effects.The algorithm has been implemented as thereusable module gnome-np.
It has been re-usedin tile web hypertext generation system ILEX(see Oberlander el; al.
(1998)).
It shows mlaccuracy over 87% with respect o two corpora(each 5000 words) of difl'erent genres.2 Accounts  of  p ronomina l i za t ionIn previous ace(rants pronominalization hasbeen related to the idea of a local focus of ~d;-tention: a set of discourse referents who/wlfichis in the center of attention of the speaker (e.g.Sidner (1979), givenness hierarchy (Gun(lel etal., 1993), centering theory (Grosz et al, 1995),RAFT/RAPId.
(Suri, 1993)).
Whereas (Gundelel; al., 1993) do not atteml)t to make their fo-cus notion operationalizable, this has been at-tempted by fllrther develolmlents of centering.However these have mostly been applied to thepronoun resolution problem.
In the followingwe discuss three versions of centering and showthat their application to the pronoun generationproblem is nevertheless linfited.Center ing .
Centering was developed to ex-plain local discourse coherence; the extent towhich it benefits pronoun generation is how-ever not immediately clear, hi centering,1We llSO the terms "discourse ntity" and "refc'rent"synonymously in this paper.306the discour.~e ntiti(:s (:vok(:d in a (',(n'l;ain ui:-terall(;e 'tt i ga'e c~dle(t fi)rward-looldng centers(Cfs).

Centering is a.lso foundin Dale (1990) as the method of t)ronominaliza-tion control.
However, Dale's center detinii;iondiffers from standard centering theory in i;hat itis defined semantically and not on the basis ofa syni;aetie ranking.

\?e 1)repose a new algorithm307that significantly simplifies the problem of pro-noun choice.
It is based on a new definition ofthe local focus, which views the discourse statusof the antecedent as the major motivation be-hind focusing.
The algorithm performs equallywell when applied to McCoy and Strube's cor-pus of newspaper articles.3 Corpus  ana lys isThe algorithm we will present below has beendeveloped in close relation to the MUSE corpus -a corpus of museum exhibit labels a.
The corpusis a collection of web pages of the Paul GettyMuseum, pages from an exhibition catalogue,and pages froln a jewellery book.
Typical char-acteristics are tile central role of inanimate ref-erents in these texts, and the lack of temporalchange thus providing an interesting counter-t)art to the newst)aper genre investigated by Mc-Coy and Strube.With an overall set of around 5000 words, tilecortms contains 1450 NPs.
Each NP has beenannotated with respect o, among others, gram-matical function, discourse status, gender, num-ber, countability, and antecedent relationships.23% of the NPs form reference chains (i.e.
atleast two mentions of one and the same referentin one text), the other 77% are only mentionedonce.
We have 101 different reference chains;the chain-fbrming NPs fall into 10\] discourse-new and 213 anaphoric NPs.
In the following,we will only discuss the anaphoric NPs.
50% ofthe anaphoric NPs are realized as definite de-scriptions, 50% as pronouns.
We distinguish be-tween locally bound pronouns, which are deter-mined syntactically (Binding Theory, (Chore-sky, 1981)), and which we expect the tacti-cal generator to handle correctly, and pronounswhich are not locally bound so-called dis-course pronouns.
We investigated possible co lrelations between the discourse 1)ronouns andsemantic/pragmatic features of their context.The basic notions that we found were dis-tance, discourse status of the antecedent, andgrammatical function of the antecedent.
Allthree notions need a precise definition.D is tance .

FollowingKameyama (1998), we take as u t te rance  unitthe finite clause, l{elative clauses and con>plenmnt clauses are not counted as utteranceson their own.
This means that we countclauses containing complement clauses or rel-ative clauses as single utterances.
4,a The pre-v ious u t te rance  is the preceding utterance atthe same level of embedding.Note that we allow the treatment of clauseswith VP coordination (subject ellipsis) as com-plex coordinated clauses as done in Kameyalna(1998), thus handling subject ellipsis as a dis-course pronoun; our algorithm does not; insiston this view however.The following correlation between pronounuse and distance was tbund in our corpus: 97%of the pronouns have an antecedent in the sameor the previous utterance.D iscourse s tatus .
The information status ofa discourse ntity in an utterance is either givenor new.
We use these terms with an identi-cal Lneaning as g~vn'nd and focus in Vallduvi(1993).
Discourse status, as introduced byPrince (1992), is a similar but different notion:A discourse ntity is d iscourse-o ld,  if it hasbeen mentioned before in the same discourse;it is d i scourse -new otherwise.
All cases ofgivenness by indirect means like part-whole,set-member relationships, other bridging rela-tions, inferences (Prince's inferrables, anchoredand situationally evoked entities) are judged asdiscourse-new, thus taking into account onlytile identity antecedent relationship.
We sharePrince's opinion that pronominalization has todo with discourse status, whereas definitenesshas to do with information status.66% of all short-distance discourse pronounsin the MUSE corpus refer to an antecedent whichis in itself discourse-old.Sub jec thood .
The third strong correlation isthe relation between pronoun use and the grmn-matical function of the antecedent.

Along with McCoy and Strubewe argue that ambiguity with respect to gen-der/number influences the pronominalizationdecision: members of the local fbcus which havea competing referent (refbrent with similar gen-der/number) in some span to the left of the ref-erent to be generated should not be realized ast)ronouns o as to minimize the inference loadfor the reader.
However, not to allow pronom-inalization in all ambiguous context situationsdoes not ~I)t)ear to be consistent with real texts(McCoy and Strube, 1999).
In the MUSE cortmsone third of all focal NPs occur in ambiguouscontexts, one half of them is pronominalized,the other half is not.
Two questions require aprecise answer to use the ambiguity constraintin a generation algorithm:?
Which set of 1)reviously mentioned refer-ents or text st)an is taken into account brreferents to be in competition??
Which referents are pronominalizcd despitean alnbiguous context?The answer is surprisingly simple: I/.eferentsof the previous utterance which are not in the lo-cal fbcus do not disturb pronominalization, evenif they have the stone gender/nmnber.
Only ifthe actual referent has a competitor in the localfbcus, is pronominalization blocked.
This is il-lustrated in Figure 1 with exmnples (3) and (4),respectively.
In (3) the microscope is discourse-old and the only member in the local focus for(u2); the competing referents ocular micrvmc-tcr" mid technology are new and hence not localfbr utterance (u2).

It is nowknown that detinite descriptions (or more gen-eral overspecified NPs) signal the start of a newdiscourse segment (Passommau, 1996; Vonk etal., 1992).
For most generation systems gener-ate from an I/ST-like text; plan, discourse seg-ments are naturally given.
The only questionfl'om the generation perspective is the degree ofdetail provided by the segmentation.Our algorithm gnome-up assumes that thediscourse segmentation has already been speci-fied.
At each segment boundary, the local focusis set to n i l ,  thereby disallowing pronominal-ization for all discourse ntities of the first ut-terance in the segment onset.It is also well known that plmmed discoursewith repeated phrases at the begimfing of aclause are seen as 'bad style'.
Identical repeatedpronouns at the clause onset are rarely foundin expository and descriptive texts (2.6% of alldiscourse pronouns in our corpus).
Hmnan writ-ers usually avoid possibly dull lack of variationby employing various aggregation techniques.310Let X 1)e a refl,'renl; I o 1)e generated in Ill;l;erailCO (112), and focu,.s 1)e the' scl; of rc'h;reni;s of the 1)rcviousul;l;eran(:(; ul) which are(a) discoursc-okl, or(b) realized as subject.

Discom'se s t ructur ing(~\ ] )  is assumed as given.
A sufficiently fine-grained discourse structur ing has been explored,for example,  by McCoy and Strube fbr their  do-n lmn of newspaper  articles, but  remMns an issuefbr future research fbr other domains.
We haveshown that  next to 1)roxilnity, the discourse sta-tus of the mltecedcnt is a main cr iter ion for trig-gering pronomilml izat ion.The  suggested a lgor i thm general izes knownfbcusing accounts.
Gundel  et al (1993)'s cog-nit ive slat, us of being "in fbcus" is now approxi-mated  by the set of all discourse-old entit ies andthe subject  of the previous utterance.
The  newfocus determinat ion  is also a general izat ion ofcenter ing's  Cb.
The  focus so defined serves twofunct ions s imultaneously:  to tr igger 1)ronomi-nMization, and to provide the set; of compet i torsfor pronoun generat ion in ambiguous  contexts.A l though our t ra in ing corpus is too small  to jus-t i fy general  clMms, the ewduat ion with respectto tile newspaper  genre provides evidence thatthis f inding is valid for p lanned discourse ill gen-erM, independent  of the concrete genre.ReferencesSusan Brennan.
