Two types of word chains have I)courecognized in (Jhinese litera.turc, i.e.
mull, f-S(~llS( ~, combinations and interse(;1;ion coral)i-nactions (\]hlallg a,lid Liu, 1988).
The sl, ring1245;~N is an example of multi-sense combination;(ice), ~I(box) and ~N(refrigerator) are allwords.
The character string ~f lN is an exam-ple of intersection combination; Ntfl(paddle)is a word and ~fl~(sell.-at-sate-price) s also aword, whereas tfl is the intersection charac-ter.
The example of the string ~ f l ~  fillustrates the typical segmentation ambigu-ity caused by word chains.
The segmentationof this string can be either(fl'hc ping-pong-balLs were soht outat saleprice.)
or('13e paddles for gable tennis were sold out.
)Some ambiguities can be solved by wordstructure knowledge.
Others can be disam-biguated by syntactic and/or semantic knowl-edge.
The most difficult disambiguation isthat requiring contextual or pragmatic knowl--edge to arrive at an appropriate interpreta-tion a,s in the string ~ ~ t  which can besegmented into:(students will write a paper.)
or(student-association writes a paper'.
)Both are syntactically and semantically cor-rect.
in this case, contextual informationwould allow the reader to trace the informa-tion claimed in the previous statements tosolve ambiguity problems.3 Reasoning theory forChinese segmentationdisambiguationA model of evidential strength in inexactreasoning studied by (Buchanan and Short-liffe, 1984) has been successfully implementedin the MYCIN system.
Tihe theory is that,if a hypothesis can be derived from varioustypes of mutually exclusive vidence, then thestrength of truth of the hypothesis can be in-creased to reach a plausible conclusion.Two concepts MB\[h,e\] and Ml)\[h,e\] havebeen introduced as the measures of belief anddisbelief.
MB\[h,e\] means the measure of in-creased belief in the hypothesis h, based onthe evidence .
M l)\[h,e\] means the measure o\[increased isbelief in the hypothesis h, basedon the evidence c. To facilitate comparisonof the evidential strength of competing hy-potheses, certainty factor CF is introduced tocombine degrees of belief and disbelief as fop\]OWS:csqh ,  ~1 = M l~\[t~, e\] - MY\ [h ,  c\]in the case that a hypothesis is derived froIna number of mutually exclusive observations,the combining functions are defined as:if MD\[h, el&,e2\] = 1then MB\[h, el&,e2\] = 0otherwiseM l:~\[h, el&,c2\]= MB\[h ,  e~\] + M, \ [h ,  e~\] ?
(:l - MY\[h ,  e,\])if M13\[h, el&e2\] = 1then MD\[h, cl&c~2\] = 0otherwiseM D\[h, cl &c2\]= MD\[h,e~,\] + MI)\[h, e2\], (l - mD\[h, ej\])In the case that two hypotheses are estab-lished with positive evidence from syntacticand semantic knowledge with the same de-gree, no discrimination of the strength oftruth hypotheses can be drawn.
If worldknowledge provides positive evidence for thefirst hypothesis and negative vidence to thesecond; then the strength of the first hypothe-sis is stronger than thai; of the second.
There-fore, the first hypothesis would be the mostlikely correct segmentation.A weighted certainty factor is proposedhe, re to represent he importance of variouslinguistic aspects.
The, weight is a vector offour elements representing the importance ofmorphology, syntax, semantics and pragmat-its, respectively, which total 1, i.e.Cl,;\[h,, e\] - w~ , CF\ [h ,  ~\]where Wi is the weight of the certainty fac--tor CFi in hypothesis h supported by the ev-idence e with respect o one of the linguistic1246a,specl;s.

:  }~)s is - 0 .34.1247Therefore, this segmentation is unlikely to bea coherent; string.4 D iscuss ionq_'he assignment for the weight vector isempirical.
It is based on the following analy-sis in which ~l's reresent the truth of each evi-dence/hypothesis and ~O's represent the false.Since the segmentation algorithm always pro-duces a segmented string, it is assumed thatthe evidence from morphology is true in vary-ing degrees depending on the complexity ofthe word chain.
The justification of a hy-pothesis is based on the evidence presentedby the pragmatic, semantic and syntactic as-pects shown in the following table.~-~ J pragmte I semte I s-sTfitC-(1) 0 0 0(2) 0 0(3) o o(4) 0 1 1(5) i 0 0(6) o 1(7) 1 1 0(8) 1 1hypths00001111?
Case(l) indicates that if no evidence canprove the truth of the hypothesis, thenthe hypothesis i false.?
Case(2) indicates that if the evi-dence supports an incoherent grarumat-ical sentence inconsistent with the con-text/circumstance, then the hypothesisis false as in the case of ~ ,g~-~(a  ba-nana ate a monkey).?
Case(3) indicates that if the evidencesupports a meaningful but ungrammat-ical string inconsistent with the con-text/circumstance, then the hypothesisis false, i.e.
~g~ (he wretch) againstthe real fact that he is a nice guy.?
Case(4) indicates that even if tile evi-dence supports a grammatical meaning-ful sentence but is inconsistent with thecontext/circumstance, then tile hypoth-esis is false, i.e., ,~,(~ 7vN ~ ~ N (thepresident's forced resignation makes peo-ple angry) violates the circumstance thatpeople hate the president.?
Case(5) indicates the case of an idiomaticexpression where the string is literallyungrammatical nd incoherent, but as awhole it can be interpreted figurativelyto make perfect sense.
Therefore, we as-sutTrle that the hypothesis is true as intile case of :~z~I:~J?, literally means "car-water-horse--dragon", but figuratively, itn leans  "very crowded".?
Case(6) indicates the case of a metaphoror metonymy which superficially it isan incoherent grammatical string, butby reasoning with the support of worldknowledge it can be interpreted as alneaninghd string.
Then, it is assumedthat the hypothesis is true, i.e., ~NN~g~t (1 drink North-West wind) means "ihave nothing to eat".?
Case(7) indicates that the evidence sup-ports a meaningful but ungrammat-ical string consistent with the con-text/circumstance, then the hypothesisis true as in Nla;lti (he wretch) is consis-tent with the real fact that he is a badguy.?
Case(8) indicates that if all evidencegives positive support to the hypothesis,then tile hypothesis i true.1)Yore the analysis, it seems to be thatpragmatic knowledge provides the strongestevidence for the hypothesis.
Therefore,the highest weight is assigned to the prag-matic aspect of the certainty factor, inthe absence of pragmatic inforrnation a de-fault assumption, that semantic evidence ismore important han syntactic evidence, ismade.
This can he observed in daily lifepeople communicate through many ungram-matical expressions without having a prob-lem of transferring the message such as abrief email message: ~ DRAFT-cornmerztshard copy best-asap to yw pls.
