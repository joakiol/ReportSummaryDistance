Towards Multilingual Protocol Generation ForSpontaneous Speech Dialogues*J an  A lexandersson ,  Peter  Po l le rDFK I  GmbH,  S tuhtsatzenhausweg 3, D-66123 Saarbr f i cken ,{ alexanders s on, poller}@dfki, deAbstract: This paper presents a novel multi-lingual progress protocol generation module.
The moduleis used within the speech-to--speech translation system VERBMOBIL.
The task of the protocolis to give the dialogue partners a brief description of the content of their dialogue.
We utilizean .abstract representation describing, for instance, thematic information and dialogue actsof the dialogue utterances.
From this representation we generate simplified paraphrases ofthe individual turns of the dialogue which together make up the protocol.
Instead of writingcompletely new software, the protocol generation component is almost exclusively composedof already existing modules in the system which are extended by planning and formattingroutines for protocol formulations.
We describe how the abstract information is extracted fromuser utterances in different languages and how the abstract hematic representation is used togenerate a protocol in one specific language.
Future directions are given.1 In t roduct ionVERBMOBIL is a research project aiming at a Speech-To-Speech translation system for Face-to-Face dialogues \[Bub and Schwinn 1996, Bub, Wahlster, and Waibel 1997, Wahlster 1993\].
In itsfirst phase (1993 - 1996), a bilingual (English-German) system for time scheduling negotiationdialogues was developed.
For its current second phase (1997 -2000), a third language, Japanese,has been incorporated.
Additionally, more than two people should be able to participate in thedialogue, a setting we call multi-party.
For the second phase, a novel system feature is currentlyunder development - protocol generation.
The idea is to provide the user(s ) with three kinds ofprotocols:P rogress  P ro toco l  The most salient parts of the dialogue are summarized.Resu l t  P ro toco l  The result of the negotiation is summarized.S ta tus  P ro toco l  The current status of the negotiation is summarized.The first two are generated after the dialogue is finished.
For the result protocol, a summarizationof the goal reached in the negotiation is generated.
The progress protocol serves as a simplifiedrecapitulation of the progress of the dialogue, whereas the status protocol will, on  demand, begenerated uring the ongoing dialogue.
Its task is to deliver a brief description of the current statusof the dialogue.
All protocols must be generated in all three languages, putt ing extra requests onthe protocol generation component; particularly, being as language independent as possible.
Inthis paper we focus on the first of the protocol types listed above - the progress protocol.

It may be divided into segments, whichsometimes resemble linguistic lauses like sentences.
Basic processing entity for some comPonentsis the so-called ialogue act \[Bunt 1981, Jekat et al 1995, Alexandersson et al 1997\].
For this workwe use a set of 18 dialogue acts, some purely illocutionary, e.g., requesting a proposal for a date.Some comprise propositional content, e.g., proposing a date.
An important property of the dialogueact is its language independence - it should be possible to be used for the annotation of dialoguesin any language.
Linguistic information is encoded in an abstract data type, the so called VIT ?
(VERBMOBIL Interface Term, \[Bos et al 1996, Dorna 1996\]).
A VIT is a semantic representationformalism following the Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) of \[Kamp and Reyle 1993\].
A VITconsists of a set of semantic onditions (i.e.
predicates, roles, operators and quantifiers) and allowsfor under-specifications with respect o scope and subordination or inherent under-specifications.Each discourse individual is formally represented by a discourse referent (also called instance).Information about the individual is encoded by one (or more) VIT-condition(s), combining apredicate with the discourse referent (see section 4).?
Propositional information (currently time expressions) is encoded in a knowledge representationlanguage \[Kiissner and Stede 1995\].
It is a quite surface-oriented language, but contains someinterlingua-like expressions for, e.g., month-of-year (moy), weekdays (dow), time-of-day (rod) andpart-of-day(pod).
Figure 1 gives some examples, of so-called "tempexl-expressions ".The first of February \[moy : 2, dora: 1\]Two o'clock in thursday \[rod: 14 : 00 ,dow :thu\]Tomorrow between 8 in the morning and 14 hour \[dow:tomorrow,boundaries ( \[rod : 08 : 00\],\[tod : 03 : 00 ,pod : pm\],from_to) \]Figure 1: Some tempex expressions2.2 The  VERBMOBIL sys temThe VERBMOBIL system is a flexible, speaker independent speech-to-speech translation system forspontaneous speech.
To support the robustness of the overall system, the translation process issubdivided into several processing tracks.
The most accurat e translation track is a deep linguistic?analysis in combination with semantic transfer and syntactic generation (see figure 2).
When thistrack fails, the translation is performed by other shallow; translation components.
In this paper wewill just consider the dialogue act based analysis and transfer \[Block 1997\].
Effects of spontaneousspeech like hesitations, corrected and revised utterance parts do not provide any translation- andthereby protocol- relevant information.
They have to be recognized and filtered out during theanalysis and/or translation process.
In figure 2 a sketch of some of the linguistic components igiven.
The translation process consists of two tracks, the deep and the shallow translation.
The deeplinguistic translation track, whose modules all exchange linguistic information encoded in VITs,consists of three components: An HPSG-parser combined with a robust semantic omponent,1TEMPoral EXpression199the semantic based transfer component \[Dorna nd Emele 1996\] and the generation component\[Becket et al 1998\], an efficient-multi-lingual generator (some more details below).The shallow track bases its translation on dialogue acts and the propositional content (cur-rently time expressions).
Based on the input string, the dialogue act is determined, which in corn-= - .... ' - - k=o-I I-.Figure 2: Overview of the VERBMOBIL systembination with the propositionalcontent is transfered using fixedtemplates.
The DIAKON com-ponent exchanges contextual in-formation with 15 different com-ponents.
It consists of two sub-components, the Context Disam-biguation component and the Di-alogue component.
The former isresponsible for, e.g., the disam-biguation of semantic predicates?and the computation of time ex-pressions.
The latter, followinga hybrid approach (more detailsin the next section), supports, forinstance, the analysis component with top down predictions what dialogue act is next to come.3 Requirements for the protocol generationThe protocol may contain original system translations as well as paraphrases of the user utterancesdepending on the translation system's internal information about them.
Additionally, thematicallyirrelevant parts of the dialogue, i.e.
dialogue contributions not relating to the communicative goal,should not be reflected in the protocol.
Moreover, some information is condensed in the protocolstructure (in comparison to the original dialogue contributions) or removed from the protocolStructure following different criteria of "protocol relevance".
Example of the latter are utterancesannotated with the dialogue acts e.g.
FEEDBACK_  $ or  DELIBERATE_* can under most circumstancesbe removed.
We are putting extra attention to this, since the removal of utterances and turnsmust not threaten the correctness of the protocol (e.g.
the dialogue must still reflect the actualnegotiation).
Parts of the dialogue, e.g., clarification sub-dialogues, can under some circumstancesbe left out from the protocol.
Stereotypical dialogue phases like the greeting phase, are reflectedin  the protocol by meta comments.
This Procedure?
has the following advantages:1.
The structure of the protocol is very close to the original dialogue and therefore it is easy tofollow for dialogue participants as well as for someone lse.2.
The use of the original system translations into the language of the protocol instead of para-phrases implifies the recapitulation of the dialogue for the dialogue participants later on.3.
The use of paraphrases of user utterances in the output language of the protocol emphasizesthat the system has "understood" the user contributions.?
Furthermore,.
by utilizing different sources of information, e.g., deep and shallow processing, we canalways generate a protocol.
The planning procedure of a protocol formulation depends on whetherthe original turn segment was given in the output language of the protocol or not.
We have to keepin mind that the dialogue partners peak different languages which means that about half of theprotocol has to be re-constructed (i.e.
condensed and paraphrased) from utterances in the outputlanguage of the protocol.
The other half of the protocol formulations may consist of utteranceswhich were translated into the output language of the protocol by the system.
Consequentty~ theplanning procedure operates as follows:200iII1a,iI!I!!I,i|I!iII11!ItIII!!
!ti!System Translat ions If the system translated the user utterance into the output language ofthe protocol, this translation is chosen as the protocol formulation.
In a system translationall irrelevant effects of spontaneous speech (e.g., hesitations, corrected or revised utteranceparts) are already removed so that the selected protocol formulation is reduced to thematicallyrelevant information.Deep V IT - representat ion  In the opposite case (i.e.
the user utterance was spoken in the outputlanguage of the protocol) the original VIT-representation f the user input produced by thedeep analysis component (if such a VIT exists) is used.
The phrase is then produces byre-generating from the VIT.
Again, effects of spontaneity are removed in such a VIT.Tempex-V IT  In all other cases (i.e.
there is no deep analysis of the user utterance) we useth?language independent tempex mechanism whose handling with respect o the planning ofprotocol formulations i described below.Up to this point only the third type has been implemented.4 Ext rac t ion  o f  P ro toco l -Re levant  DataDialogue Leve i .

.- Speaklr ,Figure 3: The Sequence Memory and the Intentional Structure of the Dialogue ModuleFor the extraction of protocol relevant data, we utilize a part of the DIAKON module, namelythe dialogue module \[Alexandersson, Reithinger, and Maier 1997\], a hybrid component consistingof a dialogue memory, a statistical component, and a plan processor.
Its processing is centeredaround dialogue acts \[Jekat et al 1995\] - it is assumed that every utterance can be attributedone (or more) dialogue acts.
important parts of the dialogue module are the sequence memory,which contains data structures for turns and segments (see figur e 3).
Each turn keeps informationlike speaker and source language.
In each segment information like the dialogue act, thematicinformation and VITs for different languages are stored.2014.1 The  P lan  ProcessorWe use the plan processor \[Alexandersson a d Reithinger 1997\] for the selection of protocol rele-vant data.
It incrementally traverses the sequence memory, building a structure which we call theintentional structure.
It is a tree like structure mirroring different abstractions of the dialogue, likesegment (dialogue act), turn (turn class), greeting phase.
In figure 3 a sketch of the intentionalstructure is shown: It divides into 4 distinct levels, where the top-most spans over the whole dia-logue, the next distinguishes the dialogue phases greeting, negotiation and closing.
The third levelconnects egments within a turn and distinguishes its turn-class.
Finally, the fourth implements(with some minor extensions) the dialogue act hierarchy.
The leaves correspond to the utterance(s)of a turn.
For each translation track, one instance of the processor is used, but the figure showsjust one.
The plan processor uses a set of plan operators (currently about 175) (see figure 4 and 5).. (defleaf feedback_acknowledge:goal (in-domain-dependent FEEDBACK_ACKNONLEDGMENT ?in ?in):constraints (first-in-turn (current-utterance))-actions (progn ;; protocol relevance?
(cond ((not (single-utterance (current-utterance)))?
(mark (current-utterance) :protocol-relevance nil))); ; dialogue phase(mark (current-utterance) :dialogue-phase(get-phase-from-context (current-utterance))): leaf FEEDBACK_ACKNOWLEDGMENT)Figure 4: A Plan Operator for Processing Utterances of Type FEEDBACK_ACKNOWLEDGMENTBoth hand-coded as well as automatically derived operators from the VERBMOBIL corpus are usedto build its structure.
The operators are incrementally expanded left to right using a mixed topdown and bottom up strategy.
A plan operator can be attributed with const ra in ts  and act ions .The constraints are used to check the relevance of a certain operator in a certain context, whereasthe actions are mostly affecting the context.
Examples of the latter are: marking an utterance asbeing protocol relevant or not, or setting the dialogue phase.4.2 Cent ra l  Contents  o f  a TurnBy determining the central contents we remove unimportant segments and merge segments in such away that the intended meaning of the turn is preserved.
The plan processor performs this operationon two levels: based on ?segments and based on turns.
By looking at, for instance, the dialogue act,it can be determined whether the segment can be removed or not.
More abstract plan operators areresponsible for removing whole turns.
An example of the latter is clarification sub-dialogues.
This,however, turns out to be very difficult when scaling up, due to irregularities in the dialogues andmore problematic: recognition errors.
In the current implementation, the plan processor performstwo operations on the context: (i) Marking a segment as (not) relevant for the protocol, and (ii)Merging two or more segments into one.Figure 4 shows a plan operator designed for processing an utterance which has been annotatedwith the dialogue FEEDBACK..ACKNOWLEDGMENT.
The operator is designed for being applied whenthe utterance is the first one in the turn, and it is stated that, unless this utterance is the only onein the turn, it is marked as not relevant for the protocol.
Another example of actions is shown infigure 5.
This operator is used for merging two successive utterances of type ACCEPT_DATE intoone.
This is done when not more than one of the utterances contains propositional contents.
Toclarify the concept of "central contents" further, consider the following turn taken from our corpus(figure 6).
If we use similar operators as in figure 4 for processing the second and third segment- as pointed out before, deliberations and feedbacks can under most circumstances be removed202IIIIIIIII'.IIIIIIiIIIIiIIIiII!IiIiI(defplan accept - i te ra te:goal  ( in-domain-dependent accept - i te ra te  ?

?out)))Figure 5: A Plan Operator for merging two ACCEPTs- the protocol relevance of the segments is affected: The first three segments are considered asnot relevant for the protocol at all, whereas the last two following segments (ACCEPT) are mergedinto one segment.
For the generation of a progress protocol, just one segment would thus beTranscription:MAW004: <P> ja  , (FEEDBACK_ACKNOWLEDGMENT) (O/0da mu"s ich real eben kucken .
(DEL IBERATE_EXPL IC IT ) ( I  have to look)+/tier/+ das i s t  ein<Z> <A> Samstag (DELIBERATE_IMPLICIT)(That's a Saturday)das i s t  bei  mir kein Problem <t> .

The result of the generation doesnot necessarily contain the spoken words, but mirrors the illocution behind the utterance.4.3 Turn ing  a segment  into a V ITPreparing the input for the surface generator we want to prepare it in the same format that it isalready able to cope with in the translation mode: VITs.
Furthermore we prefer a format that it isusable for not just one language, but for all three.If we construct, e.g., German VITs for protocol for- ,,~,x(,7,,,.,1)mulations we can utilize the transfer component to ~ I ~ ~7~ i~__~transfer the V-ITs into any other VERBMOBIL Inn- , 0guage, and then make use of the surface generator ~ l / /  .~\[,~ .d.,:~.~:---as it is.
This task is split into two steps, where the 15 Jittery \ [~ l l l l \ ] / /  ,-\ok ~ l~ IA2\ ]~first consists of generating partial language inde- \[,~,~p_,pendent VITs (henceforth tempex-VIT) on basisof the information in the selected segments (see Figure 7: VIT-semantics of a time expressionbelow).
The second step involves enriching the partial VITs with language dependent, e.g., verb-information (-see section 5).Additionally, the plan processor draws more global inferences like, which dialogue phase asegment is part of.
It also determines the turn class; information which we utilize while prepar-ing the VITs, for instance when determining the sentence mood for a segment.
For the utter-ance "How about at 2 o'clock" the corresponding information could be the dialogue act SUG-GEST._SUPPORT..DATE and the tempex expression \ [ rod :02 :00 \ ] .
A graphical represer~tation of thepartial VIT for thissegment is shown in figure 7.203The index/3 is the entry point from where the VIT can be traversed.
From the entry pointwe can reach the first grouping (15).
It is pointing at a representation the instance i2, which iscontaining the representation for 2 o'clock (crime).
The udef predicate stands for indefiniteness,with scopus over crime (via grouping 13).
Finally, cemp_/oc is an under-specification f r temporalor locational - the resolution of this under-specification s solved in the second step or by the surfacegenerator.4 .4  Input  to  the  syntact i ca l  generatorWe can now produce the input structure for the generator.
It contains on one hand generalinformation about the dialogue (which is initially stored in the dialogue memory) and on the otherhand an ordered list of protocol-relevant i formation of the individual Segments of the turns.
Thefollowing information is included in the abstract protocol representation:??
the date, time and location where the dialogue took place,?
the beginning time and the end time of the dialogue,?
a detailed list describing the thematic ontents of all turns of the dialogue.
Each of the turndescriptions includes the information about (i) speaker, and (ii) a detailed escription of theindividual segments of the turn each of which contains the following information: dialoguephase, dialogue act, sentence mood, turn class, a deep VIT of the original user utterance (ifi t  exists), the original system translation, and the tempex-VIT as described above.5 Surface Generat ion  of the ProtocolThe general parts of the representation produced by the DIAKON module can be handed overto the protocol more or less directly while the ?information about the individual turns and theirsegments i  abstract and has, therefore, to be the source of a planning process of an appropriateprotocol formulation.
In order to keep the original ordering of turns and their segments intact,our module generates one protocol formulation for each segment.
The planning of an appropriateprotocol formulation for one segment has to consider different cases which require different planningprocedures tocome up with a formulation.5.1 F rom Tempex-V IT  to  P ro toco l  Representat ionsThe processing proceeds on the semantic level based on the VIT-formalism but now switchingto language specific operations.
We defined a structured set of VIT-patterns whose task is toinsert a verb into the tempex-VIT (which only contains time expressions) and its obligatory verbarguments in order to come up with a complete sentence.
This final VIT-representation will thenbe handed over to the generation module of the VERBMOBIL system for verbalization.
The coreplanning step consists of the selection and application of an appropriate VIT-pattern of a segmentwhich is determined by the following three main criteria:?
The first criterion to find an applicable pattern is the dialogue act of the segment whichmeans that for all 18 possible dialogue acts ?there is a structured list of applicable patterns.
*:The second criterion is the sentence mood of the user utterance.?
The third one is the question whether the time expression contained in the tempex-VIT canbe assigned irectly to a verb argument position or not.
This distinction is important becauseit requires different semantic handling of the tempex-VIT (e.g., the subject argument of themain verb).IiI:!
!iIJ"1ii204Figure 8 shows an example of such a structured pattern list which contains only one alternative 2for each possible parameter combination for the dialogue act SUGGEST_SUPPORT..DATE:(e t le  ;SUGGEST_SUPPORT_DATE' ( ( ( : sentence-mood)(quest ((:tempex) (yes ((:abstr-tempex)(yes VALUE (verb+ppron-subj+tempex-pp freihaben))(no VALUE (verb+tempex-subj+bei-pp Eehen_passen))))(no VALUE #IMPOSSIBLE#)))(decl ((:tempex) (yes ((:abstr-tempex)(yes VALUE (verb+ppron-subj+tempex-pp-as-acc vorschlagen))(no VALUE,(verb+ppron-subj+tempex-acc vorschlagen))))(no VALUE #IMPOSSIBLE.
))))))Figure 8: Example of a Pattern choice netThe entry is organized as a discrimination tree consisting of declaratively annotated alter-nating tests and values.
The test-key :sentence-mood stands for the test of the sentence moodof a segment representation, :tempex checks for the existence of a tempex-VIT (which is notFigure 9: VIT-semantics of a protocol formulationnecessarily the case - as in figure 6, an AC-CEPT ca21 contain a temporal expression ornot.)
and :abst r - tempex checks the men-tioned distinction whether the time expres-sion of a tempex-VIT can be assigned irectlyto a verb argument position or not.
Sen-tence moods above are quest (question) anddecl (declarative).
The keyword VALUE indi-cates, e.g., (vei'b4-ppron-subj-/-tempez-pp frei-haben).
This is a pattern function which willbe applied on the tempex-VIT.
In this casethe verb freihaben and a personal pronoun in subject position (ppron-subj) will be added to thetempex-VIT which will presumably be realized as a prepositional phrase (tempex-pp).
The ap-plication of verb?ppron-subj-/-tempex-pp to the example VIT in figure 7 (which is a (languageindependent) representation for "at 2 o'clock ?"
as an elliptical question) results in the languagespecific (German) VIT given in figure 9 .The semantic structure of the tim(dition temp_loc for discourse referentil of the tempex-VIT has been ex-changed by a condition for the German(temporally intended) preposition um(at).
I1 is extended furthermore bythe main verb /reihaben and a con-dition for its verb argument in sub-ject position (argl) which is realizedby the personal pronoun (pron) in i3.The verbalization of this VIT will be"Haben Sic um 2 Uhr frei ?"
(literally:!
'Are you at 2 o'clock free ?
").expression remains unchanged.

VM-GECO is a highly efficient multi-lingualgeneration component which consists of a language independent kernel syntactic generator andlanguage specific declarative knowledge sources for syntactic and lexical choices.
The last step ofour protocol generation module is the formatting of the protocol into an easily understandableand readable format.
As the protocol consists of global information about the dialogue itself aswell as paraphrased turn segments we chose a protocol format which allows for clear distinctionbetween these parts of the protocol.
Furthermore it is important to assign the speaker's name (if itis known) to the protocol formulations of each turn.
There are three different formatting devices.The most prominent one is the production of a HTML-format of the protocol.
Additionally, I~TEXand ASCII versions are available.Figure 10 shows an example dialogue and the respective system translations.

are not correctly understood and translatedby the system, which is reflected in the pro-tocol.
However, with respect to the avail-able data the protocol is correct.
All proto-col formulations have been generated basedon the tempex mechanism.
The protocol con-sists of three major parts.
First there is atitle (VERBMOBIL  VERLAUFSPROTOKOLL  NR.3 - -VERBMOBIL  PROGRESS PROTOCOL NO.3), followed by general information about thedialogue: date (Datum) and time (Uhrzeit).The main content  (GESPR.~CHSVERLAUF -PROGRESS OF THE D IALOGUE)  a re  the  ind i -v idua l  turns which consist of the paraphrasedsegments.
The individual dialogue acts of the segments are noted for debugging purposes.6 Conc lus ions  and  Future  workWe presented a novel module for progress protocol generation.
Up to now at least 20 differentprotocols have been successfully generated.
There are still open questions to be answered andfurther work is necessary to get a system able to generate more natural and flexible protocols.Future attention are and will be payed to: (i) Extending the current protocol?generator to thegeneration of result and status protocols.
Currently we are developing a language independentrepresentation f propositional contents of turns and dialogues as a whole and also extending thegeneration component to produce coherent paragraphs.
(ii) Indirect speech: By utilizing abstractinformation like dialogue act and propositional contents of the segments, we are free to switch toindirect speech.
Rules and heuristics for when and how have to be developed.
(iii) By coupling thethematic structure more tightly to the plan processor we hope to be able to utilize information likegiven-new and contrast, thereby generating more natural paraphrases, and determining when andhow two segments carrying the same dialogue act and temporal information can be merged.
