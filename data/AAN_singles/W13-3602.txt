Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning: Shared Task, pages 13?19,Sofia, Bulgaria, August 8-9 2013. c?2013 Association for Computational LinguisticsThe University of Illinois System in the CoNLL-2013 Shared TaskAlla Rozovskaya Kai-Wei Chang Mark Sammons Dan RothCognitive Computation GroupUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignUrbana, IL 61801{rozovska,kchang10,mssammon,danr}@illinois.eduAbstractThe CoNLL-2013 shared task focuses oncorrecting grammatical errors in essayswritten by non-native learners of English.In this paper, we describe the Universityof Illinois system that participated in theshared task.
The system consists of fivecomponents and targets five types of com-mon grammatical mistakes made by En-glish as Second Language writers.
We de-scribe our underlying approach, which re-lates to our previous work, and describethe novel aspects of the system in more de-tail.
Out of 17 participating teams, our sys-tem is ranked first based on both the orig-inal annotation and on the revised annota-tion.1 IntroductionThe task of correcting grammar and usage mis-takes made by English as a Second Language(ESL) writers is difficult for several reasons.
First,many of these errors are context-sensitive mistakesthat confuse valid English words and thus can-not be detected without considering the contextaround the word.
Second, the relative frequencyof mistakes is quite low: for a given type of mis-take, an ESL writer will typically make mistakesin only a small proportion of relevant structures.For example, determiner mistakes usually occurin 5% to 10% of noun phrases in various anno-tated ESL corpora (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a).Third, an ESL writer may make multiple mistakesin a single sentence, which may give misleadinglocal cues for individual classifiers.
In the exam-ple shown in Figure 1, the agreement error on theverb ?tend?
interacts with the noun number erroron the word ?equipments?.Therefore , the *equipments/equipment of bio-metric identification *tend/tends to be in-expensive .Figure 1: Representative ESL errors in a samplesentence from the training data.The CoNLL-2013 shared task (Ng et al 2013)focuses on the following five common mistakesmade by ESL writers:?
article/determiner?
preposition?
noun number?
subject-verb agreement?
verb formErrors outside this target group are present in thetask corpora, but are not evaluated.In this paper, we present a system that combinesa set of statistical models, where each model spe-cializes in correcting one of the errors describedabove.
Because the individual error types havedifferent characteristics, we use several differentapproaches.
The article system builds on the el-ements of the system described in (Rozovskayaand Roth, 2010c).
The preposition classifier usesa combined system, building on work describedin (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2011) and (Rozovskayaand Roth, 2010b).
The remaining three models areall Na?
?ve Bayes classifiers trained on the GoogleWeb 1T 5-gram corpus (henceforth, Google cor-pus, (Brants and Franz, 2006)).We first briefly discuss the task (Section 2) andgive the overview of our system (Section 3).
Wethen describe the error-specific components (Sec-tions 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3).
The sections describ-ing individual components quantify their perfor-mance on splits of the training data.
In Section 4,13we evaluate the complete system on the trainingdata using 5-fold cross-validation (hereafter, ?5-fold CV?)
and in Section 5 we show the results weobtained on test.We close with a discussion focused on erroranalysis (Section 6) and our conclusions (Sec-tion 7).2 Task DescriptionThe CoNLL-2013 shared task focuses on correct-ing five types of mistakes that are commonly madeby non-native speakers of English.
The train-ing data released by the task organizers comesfrom the NUCLE corpus (Dahlmeier et al 2013),which contains essays written by learners of En-glish as a foreign language and is corrected byEnglish teachers.
The test data for the task con-sists of an additional set of 50 student essays.
Ta-ble 1 illustrates the mistakes considered in the taskand Table 2 illustrates the distribution of these er-rors in the released training data and the test data.We note that the test data contains a much largerproportion of annotated mistakes.
For example,while only 2.4% of noun phrases in the trainingdata have determiner errors, in the test data 10%of noun phrases have mistakes.Error type Percentage of errorsTraining TestArticles 2.4% 10.0%Prepositions 2.0% 10.7%Noun number 1.6% 6.0%Subject-verb agreement 2.0% 5.2%Verb form 0.8% 2.5%Table 2: Statistics on error distribution in train-ing and test data.
Percentage denotes the erro-neous instances with respect to the total number ofrelevant instances in the data.
For example, 10%of noun phrases in the test data have determinererrors.Since the task focuses on five error types, onlyannotations marking these mistakes were kept.Note that while the other error annotations wereremoved, the errors still remain in the data.3 System ComponentsOur system consists of five components that ad-dress individually article1, preposition, noun verb1We will use the terms ?article-?
and ?determiner errors?interchangeably: article errors constitute the majority of de-form and subject-verb agreement errors.Our article and preposition modules build on theelements of the systems described in Rozovskayaand Roth (2010b), Rozovskaya and Roth (2010c)and Rozovskaya and Roth (2011).
The article sys-tem is trained using the Averaged Perceptron (AP)algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1999), imple-mented within Learning Based Java (Rizzolo andRoth, 2010).
The AP system is trained using theinflation method (Rozovskaya et al 2012).
Ourpreposition system is a Na?
?ve Bayes (NB) classi-fier trained on the Google corpus and with priorparameters adapted to the learner data.The other modules ?
those that correct noun andverb errors ?
are all NB models trained on theGoogle corpus.All components take as input the corpus doc-uments preprocessed with a part-of-speech tag-ger2 and shallow parser3 (Punyakanok and Roth,2001).
Note that the shared task data alreadycontains comparable pre-processing information,in addition to other information, including depen-dency parse and constituency parse, but we choseto run our own pre-processing tools.
The articlemodule uses the POS and chunker output to gen-erate some of its features and to generate candi-dates (likely contexts for missing articles).
Theother system components use the pre-processingtools only as part of candidate generation (e.g., toidentify all nouns in the data for the noun classi-fier) because these components are trained on theGoogle corpus and thus only employ word n-gramfeatures.During development, we split the released train-ing data into five parts.
The results in Sections 3.1,3.2, and 3.3 give performance of 5-fold CV on thetraining data.
In Section 4 we report the develop-ment 5-fold CV results of the complete model andthe performance on the test data.
Note that the per-formance reported for the overall task on the testdata in Section 4 reflects the system that makes useof the entire training corpus.
It is also important toremark that only the determiner system is trainedon the ESL data.
The other models are trained onnative data, and the ESL training data is only usedto optimize the decision thresholds of the models.terminer errors, and we address only article mistakes.2http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/software view/POS3http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/software view/Chunker14Error type ExamplesArticle ?It is also important to create *a/?

buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes.
?Preposition ?As the number of people grows, the need *of /for habitable environ-ment is unquestionably essential.Noun number Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live fortheir *citizen/citizens as they tend to get overpopulated.
?Subject-verb agreement ?Therefore , the equipments of biometric identification *tend/tendsto be inexpensive.Verb form?...countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increasetheir habitable land and *using/use irrigation..?
?it was not *surprised/surprising to observe an increasing need for aconvenient and cost effective platform.
?Table 1: Example errors.
Note that only the errors exemplifying the relevant phenomena are markedin the table; the sentences may contain other mistakes.
Errors marked as verb form include multiplegrammatical phenomena that may characterize verbs.3.1 DeterminersThere are three types of determiner error: omittinga determiner; choosing an incorrect determiner;and adding a spurious determiner.
Even thoughthe majority of determiner errors involve articlemistakes, some of these errors involve personaland possessive pronouns.4 Most of the determinererrors, however, involve omitting an article (thesemake up over 60% in the training data).
Similar er-ror patterns have been observed in other ESL cor-pora (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a).Our system focuses on article errors.
The sys-tem first extracts from the data all articles, and allspaces at the beginning of a noun phrase where anarticle is likely to be omitted (Han et al 2006; Ro-zovskaya and Roth, 2010c).
Then we train a multi-class classifier with features described in Table 3.These features were used successfully in previoustasks in error correction (Rozovskaya et al 2012;Rozovskaya et al 2011).The original word choice (the source article)used by the writer is also used as a feature.
Sincethe errors are sparse, this feature causes the modelto abstain from flagging a mistake, which resultsin low recall.
To avoid this problem, we adopt theapproach proposed in (Rozovskaya et al 2012),the error inflation method, and add artificial arti-cle errors in the training data based on the errordistribution on the training set.
This method pre-vents the source feature from dominating the con-text features, and improves the recall of the sys-4e.g.
?Pat apologized to me for not keeping the*/my se-crets.
?tem.We experimented with two types of classifiers:Averaged Perceptron (AP) and an L1-generalizedlogistic regression classifier (LR).
Since the arti-cle system is trained on the ESL data, of whichwe have a limited amount, we also experimentedwith adding a language model (LM) feature to theLR learner.
This feature indicates if the correc-tion is accepted by a language model trained onthe Google corpus.
The performance of each clas-sifier on 5-fold CV on the training data is shown inTable 4.
The results show that AP performs betterthan LR.
We observed that adding the LM featureimproves precision but results in lower F1, so wechose the AP classifier without the LM feature forour final system.Model Precision Recall F1AP (inflation) 0.17 0.31 0.22AP (inflation+LM) 0.26 0.15 0.19LR (inflation) 0.17 0.29 0.22LR (inflation+LM) 0.24 0.21 0.22Table 4: Article development results Results on 5-foldCV.
AP With Inflation achieves the best development using aninflation constant of 0.85.
AP achieves higher performancewithout using the language model feature.3.2 PrepositionsThe most common preposition errors are replace-ments, i.e., where the author correctly recognizedthe need for a preposition, but chose the wrong oneto use.15Feature Type DescriptionWord n-grams wB, w2B, w3B, wA, w2A, w3A, wBwA, w2BwB, wAw2A, w3Bw2BwB, w2BwBwA, wBwAw2A, wAw2Aw3A,w4Bw3Bw2BwB, w3w2BwBwA, w2BwBwAw2A, wBwAw2Aw3A, wAw2Aw3w4APOS features pB, p2B, p3B , pA, p2A, p3A, pBpA, p2BpB, pAp2A, pBwB, pAwA, p2Bw2B, p2Aw2A, p2BpBpA, pBpAp2A,pAp2Ap3ANP1 headWord, npWords, NC, adj&headWord, adjTag&headWord, adj&NC, adjTag&NC, npTags&headWord, npTags&NCNP2 headWord&headPOS, headNumberwordsAfterNP headWord&wordAfterNP, npWords&wordAfterNP, headWord&2wordsAfterNP, npWords&2wordsAfterNP, headWord&3wordsAfterNP,npWords&3wordsAfterNPwordBeforeNP wB&fi ?i ?

NP1Source the word used by the original writerLM a binary feature assigned by a language modelTable 3: Features used in the article error correction system.
wB and wA denote the word immediately before and afterthe target, respectively; and pB and pA denote the POS tag before and after the target.
headWord denotes the head of the NPcomplement.
NC stands for noun compound and is active if second to last word in the NP is tagged as a noun.
Verb features areactive if the NP is the direct object of a verb.
Preposition features are active if the NP is immediately preceded by a preposition.adj feature is active if the first word (or the second word preceded by an adverb) in the NP is an adjective.
npWords and npTagsdenote all words (POS tags) in the NP.3.2.1 Preposition FeaturesAll features used in the preposition module arelexical: word n-grams in the 4-word windowaround the target preposition.
The NB-priors clas-sifier, which is part of our model, can only makeuse of the word n-gram features; it uses n-gramfeatures of lengths 3, 4, and 5.
Note that since theNB model is trained on the Google corpus, the an-notated ESL training data is used only to replacethe prior parameters of the model (see Rozovskayaand Roth, 2011 for more details).3.2.2 Training the Preposition SystemCorrecting preposition errors requires more datato achieve performance comparable to article er-ror correction due to the task complexity (Gamon,2010).
We found that training an AP model onthe ESL training data with more sophisticated fea-tures is not as effective as training on a native En-glish dataset of larger size.
The ESL training datacontains slightly over 100K preposition examples,which is several orders of magnitude smaller thanthe Google n-gram corpus.
We use the sharedtask training data to replace the prior parametersof the model (see Rozovskaya and Roth, 2011 formore details).
The NB-priors model does not tar-get preposition omissions and insertions: it cor-rects only preposition replacements that involvethe 12 most common English prepositions.
Thetask includes mistakes that cover 36 prepositionsbut we found that the model performance dropsonce the confusion set becomes too large.
Table5 shows the performance of the system on the 5-fold CV on the training data, where each time theclassifier was trained on 80% of the documents.Model Precision Recall F1NB-priors 0.14 0.14 0.14Table 5: Preposition results: NB with priors.
Results on5-fold CV.
The model is trained on the Google corpus.3.3 Correcting Nouns and VerbsThe three remaining types of errors ?
noun num-ber errors, subject-verb agreement, and the variousverb form mistakes ?
are corrected using separateNB models also trained on the Google corpus.
Wefocus here on the selection of candidates for cor-rection, as this strongly affects performance.3.3.1 Candidate SelectionThis stage selects the set of words that are pre-sented as input to the classifier.
This is a crucialstep because it limits the performance of any sys-tem: those errors that are missed at this stage haveno chance of being detected by the later stages.This is also a challenging step as the class ofverbs and nouns is open, with many English verbsand nouns being compatible with multiple parts ofspeech.
This problem does not arise in preposi-tion and article error correction, where candidatesare determined by surface form (i.e.
can be deter-mined using a closed list of prepositions or arti-cles).We use the POS tag and the shallow parser out-put to identify the set of candidates that are inputto the classifiers.
In particular, for nouns, we col-lect all words tagged as NN or NNS.
Since pre-processing tools are known to make more mis-takes on ESL data than on native data, this pro-cedure does not have a perfect result on the iden-tification of all noun mistakes.
For example, we16miss about 10% of noun errors due to POS/shallowparser errors.
For verbs, we compared severalcandidate selection methods.
Method (1) ex-tracts all verbs heading a verb phrase, as iden-tified by the shallow parser.
Method (2) ex-pands this set to words tagged with one of theverb POS tags {VB,VBN,VBG,VBD,VBP,VBZ}.However, generating candidates by selecting onlythose tagged as verbs is not good enough, since thePOS tagger performance on ESL data is known tobe suboptimal (Nagata et al 2011), especially forverbs containing errors.
For example, verbs lack-ing agreement markers are likely to be mistaggedas nouns (Lee and Seneff, 2008).
Erroneous verbsare exactly the cases that we wish to include.Method (3) adds words that are in the lemma list ofcommon English verbs compiled using the Giga-word corpus.
The last method has the highest re-call on the candidate identification; it misses only5% of verb errors, and also has better performancein the complete model.
We thus use this method.3.3.2 Noun-Verb Correction PerformanceTable 6 shows the performance of the systemsbased on 5-fold CV on the training data.
Eachmodel is trained individually on the Google cor-pus, and is individually processed to optimize therespective thresholds.Model Precision Recall F1Noun number 0.17 0.38 0.23Subject-verb agr.
0.19 0.24 0.21Verb form 0.07 0.20 0.10Table 6: Noun, subject-verb agreement andverb form results.
Results on 5-fold CV.
Themodels are trained on the Google corpus.4 Combined ModelIn the previous sections, we described the individ-ual components of the system developed to targetspecific error types.
The combined model includesall of these modules, which are each applied toexamples individually: there is no pipeline, andthe individual predictions of the modules are thenpooled.The combined system also includes a post-processing step where we remove certain correc-tions of noun and verb forms that we found oc-cur quite often but are never correct.
This hap-pens when both choices ?
the writer?s selectionand the correction ?
are valid but the latter is ob-served more frequently in the native training data.For example, the phrase ?developing country?
ischanged to ?developed country?
even though bothare legitimate English expressions.
If a correctionis frequently proposed but always results in a falsealarm, we add it to a list of changes that is ignoredwhen we generate the system output.
When wegenerate the output on Test set, 8 unique pairs ofsuch changes are ignored (36 pairs of changes intotal).We now show the combined results on the train-ing data by conducting 5-fold CV, where we addone component at a time.
Table 8 shows that therecall and the F1 scores improve when each com-ponent is added to the system.
The final systemachieves an F1 score of 0.21 on the training datain 5-fold CV.Model Precision Recall F1Articles 0.16 0.12 0.14+Prepositions 0.16 0.14 0.15+Noun number 0.17 0.23 0.20+Subject-verb agr.

The article model is trained on the ESLdata using AP.
The other models are trained on theGoogle corpus.
The last line shows the results,when all of the five modules are included.5 Test ResultsThe previous section showed the performance ofthe system on the training data.
In this section,we show the results on the test set.
As previously,the performance improves when each componentis added into the final system.
However, we alsonote that the precision is much higher while therecall is only slightly lower.
We attribute this in-creased precision to the observed differences inthe percentage of annotated errors in training vs.test (see Section 3) and hypothesize that the train-ing data may contain additional relevant errors thatwere not included in the annotation.Besides the original official annotations an-nounced by the organizers, another set of anno-tations is offered based on the combination of re-vised official annotations and accepted alternativeannotations proposed by participants.
We show inTable 8 when our system is scored based on the17revised annotations, both the precision and the re-call are higher.
Our system achieves the highestscores out of 17 participating teams based on boththe original and revised annotations.Model Precision Recall F1Scores based on the original annotationsArticles 0.48 0.11 0.18+Prepositions 0.45 0.12 0.19+Noun number 0.48 0.21 0.29+Subject-verb agr.

to create a passive construc-tion.Incorrect determiner insertion: In this era,Engineering designs can help to provide morehabitable accommodation by designing a strongermaterial so it?s possible to create a taller and saferbuilding, a better and efficient sanitation systemto prevent *?/ the disease, and also by designinga way to change the condition of the inhabitableenvironment.This example requires a model of discourse atthe level of recognizing when a specific diseaseis a focus of the text, rather than disease in gen-eral.
The use of a singular construction ?a tallerand safer building?
in this context is somewhat un-conventional and potentially makes this distinctioneven harder to detect.Incorrect verb number correction:One current human *need/needs that shouldbe given priority is the search for renewable re-sources.This appears to be the result of the systemheuristics intended to mitigate POS tagging errorson ESL text, where the word ?need?
is consideredas a candidate verb rather thana noun; this resultsin an incorrect change to make the ?verb?
agree innumber with the phrase ?one human?.Incorrect determiner deletion: This hadshown that the engineering design process is es-sential in solving problems and it ensures that theproblem is thoroughly looked into and ensure thatthe engineers are generating ideas that target themain problem, *the/?
depletion and harmful fuel.In this example, local context may suggest a liststructure, but the wider context indicates that thecomma represents an appositive structure.6.2 DiscussionNote that the presence of multiple errors can havevery negative effects on preprocessing.
For exam-ple, when an incorrect verb form is used that re-sults in a word form commonly used as a noun,the outputs of the parsers tend to be incorrect.
Thislimits the potential of rule-based approaches.Machine learning approaches, on the otherhand, require sufficient examples of each errortype to allow robust statistical modeling of contex-tual features.
Given the general sparsity of ESLerrors, together with the additional noise intro-duced into more sophisticated preprocessing com-ponents by errors with overlapping contexts, it ap-pears hard to leverage these more sophisticatedtools to generate features for machine learning ap-proaches.
This motivates our use of just POS andshallow parse analysis, together with language-modeling approaches that can use counts derivedfrom very large native corpora, to provide robustinputs for machine learning algorithms.The interaction between errors suggests thatconstraints could be used to improve results by en-suring, for example, that verb number, noun num-ber, and noun phrase determiner are consistent.This is more difficult than it may first appear fortwo reasons.
First, the noun that is the subjectof the verb under consideration may be relativelydistant in the sentence (due to the presence of in-tervening relative clauses, for example).
Second,the constraint only limits the possible correctionoptions: the correct number for the noun in fo-18cus may depend on the form used in the precedingsentences ?
for example, to distinguish between ageneral statement about some type of entity, and astatement about a specific entity.These observations suggest that achieving veryhigh performance in the task of grammar correc-tion requires sophisticated modeling of deep struc-ture in natural language documents.7 ConclusionWe have described our system that participated inthe shared task on grammatical error correctionand ranked first out of 17 participating teams.
Webuilt specialized models for the five types of mis-takes that are the focus of the competition.
Wehave also presented error analysis of the systemoutput and discussed possible directions for futurework.AcknowledgmentsThis material is based on research sponsored by DARPA under agreement num-ber FA8750-13-2-0008.
