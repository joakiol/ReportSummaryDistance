A Web-Harvested Corpus Annotated with GermaNet SensesVerena Henrich, Erhard Hinrichs, and Tatiana VodolazovaUniversity of Tu?bingenDepartment of Linguistics{firstname.lastname}@uni-tuebingen.deAbstractThis paper describes an automatic methodfor creating a domain-independent sense-annotated corpus harvested from the web.As a proof of concept, this method hasbeen applied to German, a language forwhich sense-annotated corpora are still inshort supply.
The sense inventory is takenfrom the German wordnet GermaNet.
Theweb-harvesting relies on an existing map-ping of GermaNet to the German versionof the web-based dictionary Wiktionary.The data obtained by this method consti-tute WebCAGe (short for: Web-HarvestedCorpus Annotated with GermaNet Senses),a resource which currently represents thelargest sense-annotated corpus available forGerman.
While the present paper focuseson one particular language, the method assuch is language-independent.1 MotivationThe availability of large sense-annotated corporais a necessary prerequisite for any supervised andmany semi-supervised approaches to word sensedisambiguation (WSD).
There has been steadyprogress in the development and in the perfor-mance of WSD algorithms for languages such asEnglish for which hand-crafted sense-annotatedcorpora have been available (Agirre et al 2007;Erk and Strapparava, 2012; Mihalcea et al 2004),while WSD research for languages that lack thesecorpora has lagged behind considerably or hasbeen impossible altogether.Thus far, sense-annotated corpora have typi-cally been constructed manually, making the cre-ation of such resources expensive and the com-pilation of larger data sets difficult, if not com-pletely infeasible.
It is therefore timely and ap-propriate to explore alternatives to manual anno-tation and to investigate automatic means of cre-ating sense-annotated corpora.
Ideally, any auto-matic method should satisfy the following crite-ria:(1) The method used should be language inde-pendent and should be applicable to as manylanguages as possible for which the neces-sary input resources are available.
(2) The quality of the automatically generateddata should be extremely high so as to be us-able as is or with minimal amount of manualpost-correction.
(3) The resulting sense-annotated materials (i)should be non-trivial in size and should bedynamically expandable, (ii) should not berestricted to a narrow subject domain, butbe as domain-independent as possible, and(iii) should be freely available for other re-searchers.The method presented below satisfies all ofthe above criteria and relies on the following re-sources as input: (i) a sense inventory and (ii) amapping between the sense inventory in questionand a web-based resource such as Wiktionary1 or1http://www.wiktionary.org/387Wikipedia2.As a proof of concept, this automatic methodhas been applied to German, a language for whichsense-annotated corpora are still in short supplyand fail to satisfy most if not all of the crite-ria under (3) above.
While the present paperfocuses on one particular language, the methodas such is language-independent.
In the caseof German, the sense inventory is taken fromthe German wordnet GermaNet3 (Henrich andHinrichs, 2010; Kunze and Lemnitzer, 2002).The web-harvesting relies on an existing map-ping of GermaNet to the German version of theweb-based dictionary Wiktionary.
This mappingis described in Henrich et al(2011).
Theresulting resource consists of a web-harvestedcorpus WebCAGe (short for: Web-HarvestedCorpus Annotated with GermaNet Senses),which is freely available at: http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/en/webcage.shtmlThe remainder of this paper is structured asfollows: Section 2 provides a brief overview ofthe resources GermaNet and Wiktionary.
Sec-tion 3 introduces the mapping of GermaNet toWiktionary and how this mapping can be usedto automatically harvest sense-annotated materi-als from the web.
The algorithm for identifyingthe target words in the harvested texts is describedin Section 4.
In Section 5, the approach of au-tomatically creating a web-harvested corpus an-notated with GermaNet senses is evaluated andcompared to existing sense-annotated corpora forGerman.
Related work is discussed in Section 6,together with concluding remarks and an outlookon future work.2 Resources2.1 GermaNetGermaNet (Henrich and Hinrichs, 2010; Kunzeand Lemnitzer, 2002) is a lexical semantic net-work that is modeled after the Princeton Word-Net for English (Fellbaum, 1998).
It partitions the2http://www.wikipedia.org/3Using a wordnet as the gold standard for the sense inven-tory is fully in line with standard practice for English wherethe Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is typically takenas the gold standard.lexical space into a set of concepts that are inter-linked by semantic relations.
A semantic conceptis represented as a synset, i.e., as a set of wordswhose individual members (referred to as lexicalunits) are taken to be (near) synonyms.
Thus, asynset is a set-representation of the semantic rela-tion of synonymy.There are two types of semantic relations inGermaNet.
Conceptual relations hold betweentwo semantic concepts, i.e.
synsets.
They in-clude relations such as hypernymy, part-whole re-lations, entailment, or causation.
Lexical rela-tions hold between two individual lexical units.Antonymy, a pair of opposites, is an example of alexical relation.GermaNet covers the three word categories ofadjectives, nouns, and verbs, each of which ishierarchically structured in terms of the hyper-nymy relation of synsets.
The development ofGermaNet started in 1997, and is still in progress.GermaNet?s version 6.0 (release of April 2011)contains 93407 lexical units, which are groupedinto 69594 synsets.2.2 WiktionaryWiktionary is a web-based dictionary that is avail-able for many languages, including German.
Asis the case for its sister project Wikipedia, itis written collaboratively by volunteers and isfreely available4.
The dictionary provides infor-mation such as part-of-speech, hyphenation, pos-sible translations, inflection, etc.
for each word.It includes, among others, the same three wordclasses of adjectives, nouns, and verbs that arealso available in GermaNet.
Distinct word sensesare distinguished by sense descriptions and ac-companied with example sentences illustratingthe sense in question.Further, Wiktionary provides relations toother words, e.g., in the form of synonyms,antonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms, holonyms, andmeronyms.
In contrast to GermaNet, the relationsare (mostly) not disambiguated.For the present project, a dump of the Ger-man Wiktionary as of February 2, 2011 is uti-4Wiktionary is available under the Cre-ative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike licensehttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en388Figure 1: Sense mapping of GermaNet and Wiktionary using the example of Bogen.lized, consisting of 46457 German words com-prising 70339 word senses.
The Wiktionary datawas extracted by the freely available Java-basedlibrary JWKTL5.3 Creation of a Web-Harvested CorpusThe starting point for creating WebCAGe is anexisting mapping of GermaNet senses with Wik-tionary sense definitions as described in Henrichet al(2011).
This mapping is the result of atwo-stage process: i) an automatic word overlapalignment algorithm in order to match GermaNetsenses with Wiktionary sense descriptions, andii) a manual post-correction step of the automaticalignment.
Manual post-correction can be kept ata reasonable level of effort due to the high accu-racy (93.8%) of the automatic alignment.The original purpose of this mapping was toautomatically add Wiktionary sense descriptionsto GermaNet.
However, the alignment of thesetwo resources opens up a much wider range of5http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/software/jwktlpossibilities for data mining community-drivenresources such as Wikipedia and web-generatedcontent more generally.
It is precisely this poten-tial that is fully exploited for the creation of theWebCAGe sense-annotated corpus.Fig.
1 illustrates the existing GermaNet-Wiktionary mapping using the example word Bo-gen.
The polysemous word Bogen has three dis-tinct senses in GermaNet which directly corre-spond to three separate senses in Wiktionary6.Each Wiktionary sense entry contains a definitionand one or more example sentences illustratingthe sense in question.
The examples in turn areoften linked to external references, including sen-tences contained in the German Gutenberg textarchive7 (see link in the topmost Wiktionary senseentry in Fig.
1), Wikipedia articles (see link forthe third Wiktionary sense entry in Fig.
1), andother textual sources (see the second sense en-try in Fig.
1).
It is precisely this collection of6Note that there are further senses in both resources notdisplayed here for reasons of space.7http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/389Figure 2: Sense mapping of GermaNet and Wiktionary using the example of Archiv.heterogeneous material that can be harvested forthe purpose of compiling a sense-annotated cor-pus.
Since the target word (rendered in Fig.
1in bold face) in the example sentences for a par-ticular Wiktionary sense is linked to a GermaNetsense via the sense mapping of GermaNet withWiktionary, the example sentences are automati-cally sense-annotated and can be included as partof WebCAGe.Additional material for WebCAGe is harvestedby following the links to Wikipedia, the Guten-berg archive, and other web-based materials.
Theexternal webpages and the Gutenberg texts are ob-tained from the web by a web-crawler that takessome URLs as input and outputs the texts of thecorresponding web sites.
The Wikipedia articlesare obtained by the open-source Java WikipediaLibrary JWPL 8.
Since the links to Wikipedia, theGutenberg archive, and other web-based materialsalso belong to particular Wiktionary sense entriesthat in turn are mapped to GermaNet senses, thetarget words contained in these materials are au-tomatically sense-annotated.Notice that the target word often occurs more8http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/software/jwpl/than once in a given text.
In keeping withthe widely used heuristic of ?one sense per dis-course?, multiple occurrences of a target word ina given text are all assigned to the same GermaNetsense.
An inspection of the annotated data showsthat this heuristic has proven to be highly reliablein practice.
It is correct in 99.96% of all targetword occurrences in the Wiktionary example sen-tences, in 96.75% of all occurrences in the exter-nal webpages, and in 95.62% of the Wikipediafiles.WebCAGe is developed primarily for the pur-pose of the word sense disambiguation task.Therefore, only those target words that are gen-uinely ambiguous are included in this resource.Since WebCAGe uses GermaNet as its sense in-ventory, this means that each target word has atleast two GermaNet senses, i.e., belongs to at leasttwo distinct synsets.The GermaNet-Wiktionary mapping is not al-ways one-to-one.
Sometimes one GermaNetsense is mapped to more than one sense in Wik-tionary.
Fig.
2 illustrates such a case.
Forthe word Archiv each resource records three dis-tinct senses.
The first sense (?data repository?
)390in GermaNet corresponds to the first sense inWiktionary, and the second sense in GermaNet(?archive?)
corresponds to both the second andthird senses in Wiktionary.
The third sense inGermaNet (?archived file?)
does not map onto anysense in Wiktionary at all.
As a result, the wordArchiv is included in the WebCAGe resource withprecisely the sense mappings connected by thearrows shown in Fig.
2.
The fact that the sec-ond GermaNet sense corresponds to two sensedescriptions in Wiktionary simply means that thetarget words in the example are both annotated bythe same sense.
Furthermore, note that the wordArchiv is still genuinely ambiguous since there isa second (one-to-one) mapping between the firstsenses recorded in GermaNet and Wiktionary, re-spectively.
However, since the third GermaNetsense is not mapped onto any Wiktionary sense atall, WebCAGe will not contain any example sen-tences for this particular GermaNet sense.The following section describes how the targetwords within these textual materials can be auto-matically identified.4 Automatic Detection of Target WordsFor highly inflected languages such as German,target word identification is more complex com-pared to languages with an impoverished inflec-tional morphology, such as English, and thus re-quires automatic lemmatization.
Moreover, thetarget word in a text to be sense-annotated isnot always a simplex word but can also appearas subpart of a complex word such as a com-pound.
Since the constituent parts of a compoundare not usually separated by blank spaces or hy-phens, German compounding poses a particularchallenge for target word identification.
Anotherchallenging case for automatic target word detec-tion in German concerns particle verbs such as an-ku?ndigen ?announce?.
Here, the difficulty ariseswhen the verbal stem (e.g., ku?ndigen) is separatedfrom its particle (e.g., an) in German verb-initialand verb-second clause types.As a preprocessing step for target word identi-fication, the text is split into individual sentences,tokenized, and lemmatized.
For this purpose, thesentence detector and the tokenizer of the suiteof Apache OpenNLP tools9 and the TreeTagger(Schmid, 1994) are used.
Further, compoundsare split by using BananaSplit10.
Since the au-tomatic lemmatization obtained by the tagger andthe compound splitter are not 100% accurate, tar-get word identification also utilizes the full set ofinflected forms for a target word whenever suchinformation is available.
As it turns out, Wik-tionary can often be used for this purpose as wellsince the German version of Wiktionary oftencontains the full set of word forms in tables11 suchas the one shown in Fig.
3 for the word Bogen.Figure 3: Wiktionary inflection table for Bogen.Fig.
4 shows an example of such a sense-annotated text for the target word Bogen ?vi-olin bow?.
The text is an excerpt from theWikipedia article Violine ?violin?, where the targetword (rendered in bold face) appears many times.Only the second occurrence shown in the figure(marked with a 2 on the left) exactly matches theword Bogen as is.
All other occurrences are ei-ther the plural form Bo?gen (4 and 7), the geni-tive form Bogens (8), part of a compound suchas Bogenstange (3), or the plural form as partof a compound such as in Fernambukbo?gen andSchu?lerbo?gen (5 and 6).
The first occurrenceof the target word in Fig.
4 is also part of acompound.
Here, the target word occurs in thesingular as part of the adjectival compound bo-gengestrichenen.For expository purposes, the data format shownin Fig.
4 is much simplified compared to the ac-tual, XML-based format in WebCAGe.
The infor-9http://incubator.apache.org/opennlp/10http://niels.drni.de/s9y/pages/bananasplit.html11The inflection table cannot be extracted with the JavaWikipedia Library JWPL.
It is rather extracted from the Wik-tionary dump file.391Figure 4: Excerpt from Wikipedia article Violine ?violin?

These tokens belong to 2607 distinct pol-ysemous words contained in GermaNet, amongwhich there are 211 adjectives, 1499 nouns, and897 verbs (see Table 2).
On average, these wordshave 2.9 senses in GermaNet (2.4 for adjectives,2.6 for nouns, and 3.6 for verbs).Table 2 also shows that WebCAGe is consid-erably larger than the other two sense-annotatedcorpora available for German ((Broscheit et al2010) and (Raileanu et al 2002)).
It is impor-tant to keep in mind, though, that the other tworesources were manually constructed, whereasWebCAGe is the result of an automatic harvestingmethod.
Such an automatic method will only con-stitute a viable alternative to the labor-intensivemanual method if the results are of sufficient qual-ity so that the harvested data set can be used as isor can be further improved with a minimal amountof manual post-editing.For the purpose of the present evaluation, weconducted a precision- and recall-based analy-sis for the text types of Wiktionary examples,external webpages, and Wikipedia articles sep-392Table 1: Current size of WebCAGe.Wiktionary External Wikipedia Gutenberg Allexamples webpages articles texts textsNumber oftaggedwordtokensadjectives 575 31 79 28 713nouns 4103 446 1643 655 6847verbs 2966 112 10 102 3190all word classes 7644 589 1732 785 10750Number oftaggedsentencesadjectives 565 31 76 26 698nouns 3965 420 1404 624 6413verbs 2945 112 10 102 3169all word classes 7475 563 1490 752 10280Totalnumber ofsentencesadjectives 623 1297 430 65030 67380nouns 4184 9630 6851 376159 396824verbs 3087 5285 263 146755 155390all word classes 7894 16212 7544 587944 619594Table 2: Comparing WebCAGe to other sense-tagged corpora of German.WebCAGeBroscheit et Raileanu etal., 2010 al., 2002Sensetaggedwordsadjectives 211 6 0nouns 1499 18 25verbs 897 16 0all word classes 2607 40 25Number of tagged word tokens 10750 approx.

Table 3 shows that precisionand recall for all three word classes that occurfor Wiktionary examples, external webpages, andWikipedia articles lies above 92%.
The only size-able deviations are the results for verbs that occurin the Gutenberg texts.
Apart from this one excep-tion, the results in Table 3 prove the viability ofthe proposed method for automatic harvesting ofsense-annotated data.
The average precision forall three word classes is of sufficient quality to beused as-is if approximately 2-5% noise in the an-notated data is acceptable.
In order to eliminatesuch noise, manual post-editing is required.
How-ever, such post-editing is within acceptable lim-its: it took an experienced research assistant a to-tal of 25 hours to hand-correct all the occurrencesof sense-annotated target words and to manuallysense-tag any missing target words for the fourtext types.6 Related Work and Future DirectionsWith relatively few exceptions to be discussedshortly, the construction of sense-annotated cor-pora has focussed on purely manual methods.This is true for SemCor, the WordNet Gloss Cor-pus, and for the training sets constructed for En-glish as part of the SensEval and SemEval sharedtask competitions (Agirre et al 2007; Erk andStrapparava, 2012; Mihalcea et al 2004).
Purelymanual methods were also used for the Germansense-annotated corpora constructed by Broscheitet al(2010) and Raileanu et al(2002) as well asfor other languages including the Bulgarian and393Table 3: Evaluation of the algorithm of identifying the target words.Wiktionary External Wikipedia Gutenbergexamples webpages articles textsPrecisionadjectives 97.70% 95.83% 99.34% 100%nouns 98.17% 98.50% 95.87% 92.19%verbs 97.38% 92.26% 100% 69.87%all word classes 97.32% 96.19% 96.26% 87.43%Recalladjectives 97.70% 97.22% 98.08% 97.14%nouns 98.30% 96.03% 92.70.% 97.38%verbs 97.51% 99.60% 100% 89.20%all word classes 97.94% 97.32% 93.36% 95.42%the Chinese sense-tagged corpora (Koeva et al2006; Wu et al 2006).
The only previous at-tempts of harvesting corpus data for the purposeof constructing a sense-annotated corpus are thesemi-supervised method developed by Yarowsky(1995), the knowledge-based approach of Lea-cock et al(1998), later also used by Agirre andLopez de Lacalle (2004), and the automatic asso-ciation of Web directories (from the Open Direc-tory Project, ODP) to WordNet senses by Santa-mar?
?a et al(2003).The latter study (Santamar?
?a et al 2003) isclosest in spirit to the approach presented here.It also relies on an automatic mapping betweenwordnet senses and a second web resource.
Whileour approach is based on automatic mappings be-tween GermaNet and Wiktionary, their mappingalgorithm maps WordNet senses to ODP subdi-rectories.
Since these ODP subdirectories containnatural language descriptions of websites relevantto the subdirectory in question, this textual mate-rial can be used for harvesting sense-specific ex-amples.
The ODP project also covers German sothat, in principle, this harvesting method could beapplied to German in order to collect additionalsense-tagged data for WebCAGe.The approach of Yarowsky (1995) first collectsall example sentences that contain a polysemousword from a very large corpus.
In a second step,a small number of examples that are representa-tive for each of the senses of the polysemous tar-get word is selected from the large corpus fromstep 1.
These representative examples are manu-ally sense-annotated and then fed into a decision-list supervised WSD algorithm as a seed set for it-eratively disambiguating the remaining examplescollected in step 1.
The selection and annotationof the representative examples in Yarowsky?s ap-proach is performed completely manually and istherefore limited to the amount of data that canreasonably be annotated by hand.Leacock et al(1998), Agirre and Lopez de La-calle (2004), and Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999)propose a set of methods for automatic harvestingof web data for the purposes of creating sense-annotated corpora.
By focusing on web-baseddata, their work resembles the research describedin the present paper.
However, the underlying har-vesting methods differ.
While our approach re-lies on a wordnet to Wiktionary mapping, theirapproaches all rely on the monosemous relativeheuristic.
Their heuristic works as follows: In or-der to harvest corpus examples for a polysemousword, the WordNet relations such as synonymyand hypernymy are inspected for the presence ofunambiguous words, i.e., words that only appearin exactly one synset.
The examples found forthese monosemous relatives can then be sense-annotated with the particular sense of its ambigu-ous word relative.
In order to increase coverageof the monosemous relatives approach, Mihalceaand Moldovan (1999) have developed a gloss-based extension, which relies on word overlap ofthe gloss and the WordNet sense in question forall those cases where a monosemous relative isnot contained in the WordNet dataset.The approaches of Leacock et al Agirre andLopez de Lacalle, and Mihalcea and Moldovan as394well as Yarowsky?s approach provide interestingdirections for further enhancing the WebCAGe re-source.
It would be worthwhile to use the au-tomatically harvested sense-annotated examplesas the seed set for Yarowsky?s iterative methodfor creating a large sense-annotated corpus.
An-other fruitful direction for further automatic ex-pansion of WebCAGe is to use the heuristic ofmonosemous relatives used by Leacock et al byAgirre and Lopez de Lacalle, and by Mihalceaand Moldovan.
However, we have to leave thesematters for future research.In order to validate the language independenceof our approach, we plan to apply our method tosense inventories for languages other than Ger-man.
A precondition for such an experiment is anexisting mapping between the sense inventory inquestion and a web-based resource such as Wik-tionary or Wikipedia.
With BabelNet, Navigli andPonzetto (2010) have created a multilingual re-source that allows the testing of our approach tolanguages other than German.
As a first step inthis direction, we applied our approach to Englishusing the mapping between the Princeton Word-Net and the English version of Wiktionary pro-vided by Meyer and Gurevych (2011).
The re-sults of these experiments, which are reported inHenrich et al(2012), confirm the general appli-cability of our approach.To conclude: This paper describes an automaticmethod for creating a domain-independent sense-annotated corpus harvested from the web.
Thedata obtained by this method for German haveresulted in the WebCAGe resource which cur-rently represents the largest sense-annotated cor-pus available for this language.
