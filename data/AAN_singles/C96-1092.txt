j pAbst rac tLexical rules are used in constraint-based grammar formalisms such asllead-Driven l)hrase Structure Grammar(I IPSG) (Pollard and Sag 1994) to ex-press generalizations atnong lexical en-tries.
'\['his paper discusses a number oflexical rules from recent I\[PSG analy-ses of German (tlinri<;hs and Nakazawa1994) and shows that the grammar insome cases vastly overgenerates and inother cases introduces massive spuriousstructural ambiguity, if lexical rules ap:ply under unification.
Such l)rot)lems ofovergeneration or spurious ambiguity donot arise, if a lexical rule al)plies to agiven lexical ent;ry iff the lexical entryis subsumed by the left:hand side of thelexical rule.
I,'inally, the paper discussescomputational consequcnce~s of at)plyinglexical rules under subsuml)tion.1 In t roduct ionCurrent linguistic theories place an increasingamount of grammatical information in the lexiconand employ a variety of mechanisms to expressgeneralizations across lexical entries: templates(Flickinger 1987, Shieber 1986), inheritance hier-archies (Flickinger 1987, Pollard and Sag 11994),and lexical rules (Bresnan 1982, I)owty 1982, Gaz-daret  al.
1985, Pollard and Sag 1994).
Lexicalrules (henceibrth: LRs) have been subjected toparticularly close s<:rutiny.
'Fhis research has tb-cused on two important issues: 1. how the useof LRs affects the generative power of grammarformalisms and the computational complexity ofparsing algorithms (Uszkoreit and Peters 1986,Carpenter 1991), and 2. how to provide a de-notational semantics for LRs (Calcagno and PoPlard 1995, Meurers 1995).
In this paper we ad-dress neither of these two issues.
Instead we willconcentrate on a question that we c<msider to beof equal importance, but that has received sur-prisingly little attention: Under what conditionsshould an I,R be applicable to a given lexical entry(henceforth: LE)?
For gramrnar formalisms thatemploy the notion of unitication of attribute-valuestructures, two criteria for applicability naturallysuggest hemselves:1. llypolhcsis A: A lexical rule applies to a lexi-cal entry ifr the lexi<:al entry unifies with theleft-hand side of t;he lexical rule.2.
Hypothesis B: A lexical rule applies to a lex-ical entry iff the lexical entry is subsumed bythe left-hand side of the lexical rule)Without much argument, it is cotnmonly as-sume<t hat llypothesis A is correct (el.
Pollardand Sag 1994, (\]alcagno and Pollar<t :1995, andMeurers 1995).
This paper argues that 11ypoth-esis A should be rejected on empirical grounds.We discuss a number of Ll{s that have beenused in IIPSG analyses of German (tlinri<:hs andNakazawa 1994) and show that the grammar willeither vastly overgenerate and accept ungrammat-ical sentences or introduce spurious tructural am-biguity for grammatical sentences, if ltypothesis Ais adopted.
Itowever, no such problems ofovergeu-eration or spurious ambiguity arise, if one adoptsllypothesis B, instead.It would go beyond tim scope of this paper topresent a flJly worked-out proposal on how to i>ro -cess LRs in a coml)utational system for I IPSG.Itowever, as discussed in section 6, it is worth not-ing that the subsumption test for I,l{ application<'.an be integrated straightforwardly into two re-cent proposals by van Noord and Bouma (:1994)and by Meurers and Minnen (1995) of how to im-plement lab  in a processing system for HPSG.l'Fhis paper will not provide a formal definition ofsubsumption or nnificiation for typed feature struc-tures.
Instead, we refer the reader to the standarddefinitions of Kasper and Rounds (1986) and Carpen-tel: (1992), among many <)tilers.
Informally speaking,two feature structures are unifiable itf they do not con-tab incompatible information.
One feature structuresubsumes another iff the intormation contained in theformer is less specific than in the latter.543PPLR:IPLR:SUIIJCOMPSSUBJCOMPS\[IIF, ADIVI'~ORM pass \]sP  > -*/val, \[SUB  \[CAS,  no,,,\] >\]\[ \[CAS  acc\] I \[\] > h \[COMPS \[\]\] \[-HEAI)IVFORM pass \] \]NP > + hal, \[SUI{J < >E~\[CAS\]~ geil V dat\] I \ [ \ ]  > k t C?MPs  ( \[\]\]\[C,'ASlC gen v dat\] I \ [ \ ] )lqgure 1: Passive Lcxical l{ules for German Kiss 19922 Passive by Lexical RuleIt has been assumed in a variety of syntacticfi'ameworks that the active/passive alternationshould be treated as a lexical process: Bresnan(1982) in LFG, Dowty (1982) in Categorial Gram-mar, and Pollard and Sag (1987) for I IPSG.

'For personal passives the accusative object NPof a transitive verb, e.g.

In impersonalpassives a datiw; or genitive NP complement of atransitive verb, e.g.
the dative NP dem Mann in(2), exhibits the same case assignment in the ac-tive and passive forms.

1 and all other feature structures that are shownin this paper.According to Kiss, specifying two different case wtl-ues under one reentrancy (cf.
tags \[~ in the PPLR) isa shorthand notation for identity of the two categoriesin all respects, except for the case value.
'\]'he originalincludes the feature VALENCE (abbreviated asVAL in lqg.
1), which in turn specifies for verbsunder the features SUILI and COMPS the sub-ject and non-subject complements.
COMPS takesa list of categories, (:ailed synsem objects, as itsvahn;.
If the list is nomempty, the h:ftmost category in the list represents the direct object.
Theintended effect of the PPI, I{ is to promote the di-rect object of a. transitive verb in the l,l,\] for theactiw~' form to the subject of the passive form.
l,'ol:impersonal passives the COMPS list of any transi-tive verb whose leftmost complement is marked bygenitive or dative case remains unchanged, whilethe singleton list of the subject value of the activeform becomes the empty list in the I,E for thepassive form.
Note that the case specifications onthe left-hand side of the rules m:e crucial since theycondition which classes of transitive verbs appearin personal and impersonal passives.Viewed procedurally, the PPI,I{, is meant to ap--ply to \[,Es for transitiw; verbs such as kau,\[en asshown in |+'ig.

Inaccordance with the PPLR, this leftmost elementis promoted to the SUBJ value of kdnnen, whilethe remainder of the COMPS list of the verb gov-erned by k6nnen, identified by tag 3, is retained.Ilowever, this derived LE would have the unde-sirable consequence that it admits ill-formed sen-tences such as (6).
(6) * Das Auto wurde kaufen gekonnt.the car was bought canIn (6) the auxiliary k6nnen has been passivizedand the direct object of the transitive verb hasbeen promoted as the subject of k6nnen.
|low-ever, since in German only main verbs can be pas-sivized, the sentence is ungrammatical.
7Ungrammatical sentences uch as (6) can besuccessfiflly ruled out if the PPLR, is applied to anI,E only if the input specification of the LR sub-sumes the LE (Hypothesis B).
The subsumptionrequirement for LR application is based on the in-sight that LRs should apply only to LEs that areinstantiated at least to the extent that the inputdescription of the LR minimally requires.
In thecase at hand, the list of raised arguments in theLE for kdnnen in Fig.
3 is totally unspecified - itcan be any list of non-verbal synsem objects, in-chiding the empty list.

Therefore the COMPS list of kSnnen doesnot subsume the COMPS list on the left-handside of the PPLR, or vice versa.
Accordingly, nosubsutnption relationship exists between the inputspecification of the PPM{ as a whole and the LEfor kb'nnen, tIence if tIypothesis B is assumed,the Lt{ can be successfiflly blocked, s However,even under subsumption nothing blocks the PPLRfrom applying to the transitive verb kaufen, asdiscussed in section 2.
Therefore the grammaticalsentence in (7) can be derived successfully.
(7) Das Anto wnrde gekauft.
'The car was bought.
'5 Avoiding Spurious AmbiguityThis section will consider the interaction ofhighly schematic LEs with another LR com-monly used in IIPSG: the Complement Ex-traction LR, formulated for English by Pol-lard and Sag (1994).
Fig.

Thevalue of the feature SLASH contains those itemsthat are realized in left dislocated position, e.g.
asa topicalized constituent in sentenceqnitiM posi-tion.
Analogous to the applicability of tile PPLR,the CELt{G is applicable to LEs of transitive verbssuch as kaufcn shown in Fig.
2, under both uni-fication and subsumption.
\[File result of such anapplication is the same as shown in Fig.
2, exceptthat the direct object is placed on the SLASH setinstead of the SUB3 list.
For the analysis of sen-8The reader may wonder whether one couldn't getaround the requirement that the LR for passive applyunder subsmnption by restricting the rule to applyonly to main verbs.
At first glance this seems like apossible way-out, since the cases that we havc con-sidered problematic for applying the LR under unifi-cation involve LEs of auxiliaries.
IIowever, the (:lassof argument raising verbs is not restricted to auxil-iaries.
Verbs such as verstehen ('know how'), as in Erversteht Parser zu implementiercn ('He knows how toimpleInent parsers.
'), fall into the same class.
Butverstehen is a main verb, not an auxiliary.
Thus,even if the LR would be reformulated to apply 'onlyto auxiliaries, the following ungrammaticM sentencecould not be excluded: * Parser werden verstandenzu implementieren.546\[I\] NPI1)as Buch V* NPI Iwird Peterv \[SLAS|  {}\]V \[SLASH {\[\]\]} \]vc \[SLAS.

If Hypothesis A is assumed, then theCEI,I{G will be applicable to the type of I,E shownfor kSnnen in Fig.

One of thepossible outputs of the I3{ to such an auxiliaryentry wouht look identical to l;he putative, out-put of the PPLI t  shown in Fig.

However, the issueraised with respc'ct o the CEI,RG in this p~tper isorthogonal to overall assumptions of German obtusestructure.1?See Pollard and Sag (1994) and ltinrichs andNakazawa (1.994) for further details on the NonlocalFeature Principle and the Head-Filler ID Schema.the analysis of topicalized sentences that containauxiliaries could originate in the LE for the mainverb, but also in the LE for each auxiliary presentin the sentence.
Hence, in addition to the.
tree inFig.
6, three additionM trees are admitted for sen-tence (81) in which the SLASII value originates inone of the pre-terminal nodes for the anxiliaries.These nodes are marked lbr emphasis by an aster-isk in Fig.
6.
This ambiguity is, of course, totallyspurious since it does not correlate with a differ-ence in semantics or any other relevant linguisticproperty of the sentence.
I!
'rom a computationalperspective, such spurious ambiguities are highlyundesirable since they force the parser into con-sidering multiple analyses where a single analysissuflbes.
The spurious ambiguity that we have justidentified is particularly pernicious, since it; wouldaiD.el a wide range of sentences in any grammar ofGerman that employs argument composition andthe (JEI~I{G: all assertion main clauses that con-tMn auxiliaries would be affected since in assertionclauses the initiM constituent is the result of top-icalization.Once again undesirable consequences of over-applying an Lit under unification can be avoidedif applicability of LRs instead requires subsump-tion (llypothesis B).

6 is the only tree admitted.6 Computat iona l  ConsequencesFinally, we will consider the computational impli-cations that the adoption of lfypothesis B has forthe processing of LRs in a computational system.Since consensus on how to provide an adequatedenote|tonal semantics for I,Rs has not yet beenreached, it would go well beyond the scope of thispaper to develop a fully worked-out proposal onhow to process lJ{s. n A very promising approachUSee CMcagno and Pollard (1995) ~tt(l Menrers(11995) for further discussion.547on how to integrate LRs into processing systemsfor HPSG has been developed independently bywm Noord and Bouma (1994) and by Meurers andMinnen (1995).
It turns out that the conclusionsreached in this paper can be easily integrated inthe general framework that these authors provide.Common to these two proposals is the idea oftreating LRs as (ltorn clause) constraints on LF, sof the kind shown schematically in Fig.

the algorithm that; computes for a given lex-ical entry the output specification of the lex~ical rule, i.e.
the derived lexical entry.The subsumption test for lexical rule applica-tion that we have argued for in this paper pertainsto the first task.
The execution of the definiteclauses of the kind shown schematically in Fig.
7,which encode the possible relations between basemid derived lexical entries, pertains to the secondtask.Regarding the first task, in van Noord andBouma's approach the sequences of lexical rulesthat are applicable to a given base lexical entryhave to be specified by the grammar developeralong with delay statements, which allow goalfreezing at run riffle of not sufficiently ins\[an\[f-ated relations.
In Meurers and Minnen's approachsuch sequences are automatically generated from12This distinctkm is rightly emphasized by Cabcagno and Pollard (1995).the set of base lexical entries and the set of lexi-cal rules specified by the grammar.
The allowablesequences of lexi('al rules are compiled into finitestate automata which are in turn encoded as de\[:inite clause attachments o base lexical entries.Note thai; both approaches are general enoughto accommodate different assumptions about theapplicability of lexicat rules to lexical entries,i.e.
they are compatible with both ItypothesesA and B.
Whether or not at given lexical rule ap-plies to a. lexical entry in van Noord and l{ouma'sal)proach needs to be stipulated by the grarnmarwriter who is in theory fl:ee to use either a unifi-cation or subsumption test.
In Meurers and Min-hen's approach the deduction rules for automat-ically generating a finite-state encoding of lexi-cal rules can likewise be based on a subsumptioncheck or a unification clieck.
In this paper we haveargued on empirical grollnds that subsumptionshould be the relevant operatiw-, criterion.
Thetheoretical results of tit(', present paper c~m there-fore be straightforwardly integrated into a lexicalrule compiler of the sort described by Meurers andMinneu in which applicability of lexieal rules ischecked automatically under subsumption.7 Conc lus ion'\['his paper has discussed a number of lexicalrules from recent IIPSG analyses of German (llin-richs and Nakazawa 1994) and has shown thatthe grammar ill some eases vastly ow~rgeneratesand in other cases introduces massive spuriousstructural ambiguity, if lexical rules apply underunificationY ~ l\[owew'.r, no such problems of over-generation or spurious ambiguity arise, if a lexicalrule applies to a giwm lexieM entry iff the lexi-cal entry is subsumed by the.
