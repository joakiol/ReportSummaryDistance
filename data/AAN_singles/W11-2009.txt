TanenhausDepartment of Brain and Cognitive SciencesUniversity of RochesterRochester, NY  14627mtan@bcs.rochester.eduSuccessful communication would seem to require that speakers and listeners distinguish betweentheir own knowledge, commitments and intentions, and those of their interlocutors.
A particu-larly important distinction is between shared knowledge (common ground) and private knowl-edge (privileged ground).
Keeping track of what is shared and what is privileged might seem toocomputationally expensive and too memory intensive to inform real-time language processing--aposition supported by striking experimental evidence that speakers and listeners act egocentri-cally, showing strong and seemingly inappropriate intrusions from their own privileged ground.I?ll review recent results from my laboratory using unscripted conversation demonstrating that(1) speaker?s utterances provide evidence about whether they believe information is shared orprivileged; and (2) addressees are extremely sensitive to this evidence.
I?ll suggest an integrativeframework that explains discrepancies in the literature and might be informative for researchersin the computational dialogue community.67
