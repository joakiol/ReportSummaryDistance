CORPUS COLLECTION FOR ATISJared Ber~teinSRI InternationalMenlo Park, CA 94025PROJECT GOALSThe project goal is to collect and deliver a corpus of speechdata that supports DARPA SL~ system development.
As of Feb-ruary 1991, SRI has set up a hardware and software nvironmentfor the collection of spoken interactions with a simulated AirTravel Information System (ATIS), established a data collectionprocedure, collected and dis~buted prototype data, and evalu-ated the prototype data with feedback from the SIS systemdevelopers.
Having implemented revisions in the environmentand procedures, SKI has begun collecting and distributing acor-pus of data for ATIS SLS development.RECENT RESULTSCompleted a plan for the interface to the relational database,the collection of the prototype and production data, and thesubject environment.Collected 10 prototype subject sessions, prepered speechand auxiliary files, and shipped ata to NIST for disUibutionto interested SLS developers.
Interacted with NIST and withSIS sites to refine certain aspects of the data collectionenvironment and procedures.Modified and augmented the tools used in data collectionand file preparation; e.g., automated parts of the transcrip-tion task and the derivation of additional auxiliary files, andaugmented wizard tools to accelerate database r sponses.Provided yield and cost estimates for revised transcriptionprotocols and for extended categorization f utterances.Shipped 35 subject sessions to N\[ST.
Recorded and Wan-scribed sessions, generated auxiliary files, prepared sessionlogs and categorized utterances; checked and preparedmaterial for shipment to NIST.Shipped 32 more subject sessions to NIST.
Categorized,prepared auxiliary flies for, checked, and shipped 32 ses-sions previously recorded and transcribed in summer 1990under SKI's ATIS .SL.S contract.PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR?
Resume and accelerate data collection in the ATIS domain.?
Document systems and procedures inpreparation for exportof the wizard data collection system.?
Work with NIST and the DARPA community to define andimplement ew speech corpus collections.423
