We explore using synonyms both from WordNet and from the Latent Words Language Model (LWLM), which predicts synonyms in context using an unsupervised approach.
We evaluate a state-of-the-art time expression recognition system trained both with and without the additional training examples using data from TempEval 2010, Reuters and Wikipedia.
We find that the LWLM provides substan-tial improvements on the Reuters corpus, and smaller improvements on the Wikipedia corpus.
We find that WordNet alne never improves performance, though intersecting the examples from the LWLM and WordNet provides more stable results for Wikipedia.1 Introduction The recognition of time expressions such as April 2011, mid-September and early next week is a cru-cial first step for applications like question answer-ing that must be able to handle temporally anchored queries.
This need has inspired a variety of shared tasks for identifying time expressions, including the Message Understanding Conference named entity task (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), the Automatic Content Extraction timenormalization task (http://fofoca.mitre.org/tern.html) and the TempEval 2010 time expression task (Verhagen et al, 2010).
Many researchers com-peted in these tasks, applying both rule-based and machine-learning approaches (Mani and Wilson, 2000; Negri and Marseglia, 2004; Hacioglu et al, 2005; Ahn et al, 2007; Poveda et al, 2007; Str?tgen and Gertz 2010; Llorens et al, 2010), and achieving F1 measures as high as 0.86 for recog-nizing temporal expressions.
Yet in most of these recent evaluations, models are both trained and evaluated on text from the same domain, typically newswire.
Thus we know little about how well time expression recognition systems generalize to other sorts of text.
We there-fore take a state-of-the-art time recognizer and eva-luate it both on TempEval 2010 and on two new test sets drawn from Reuters and Wikipedia.
At the same time, we are interested in helping the model recognize more types of time expres-sions than are available explicitly in the newswire training data.
We therefore introduce a semi-supervised approach for expanding the training data, where we take words from temporal expres-sions in the data, substitute these words with likely synonyms, and add the generated examples to the training set.
We select synonyms both via Word-Net, and via predictions from the Latent Words Language Model (LWLM) (Deschacht and Moens, 2009).
We then evaluate the semi-supervised mod-el on the TempEval, Reuters and Wikipedia test sets and observe how well the model has expanded its temporal vocabulary.2712 Related Work Semi-supervised approaches have been applied to a wide variety of natural language processing tasks, including word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995), named entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999), and document classification (Sur-deanu et al, 2006).
The most relevant research to our work here is that of (Poveda et al, 2009), which investigated a semi-supervised approach to time expression rec-ognition.
They begin by selecting 100 time expres-sions as seeds, selecting only expressions that are almost always annotated as times in the training half of the Automatic Content Extraction corpus.
Then they begin an iterative process where they search an unlabeled corpus for patterns given their seeds (with patterns consisting of surrounding to-kens, parts-of-speech, syntactic chunks etc.)
and then search for new seeds given their patterns.
The patterns resulting from this iterative process achieve F1 scores of up to 0.604 on the test half of the Automatic Content Extraction corpus.
Our approach is quite different from that of (Po-veda et al, 2009) ?
we use our training corpus for learning a supervised model rather than for se-lecting high precision seeds, we generate addi-tional training examples using synonyms rather than bootstrapping based on patterns, and we evaluate on Reuters and Wikipedia data that differ from the domain on which our model was trained.
3 Method The proposed method implements a supervised machine learning approach that classifies each chunk-phrase candidate top-down starting at the parse tree root provided by the OpenNLP parser.
Time expressions are identified as phrasal chunks with spans derived from the parse as described in (Kolomiyets and Moens, 2010).
3.1 Basic TempEval Model We implemented a logistic regression model with the following features for each phrase-candidate: ?
The head word of the phrase ?
The part-of-speech tag of the head word ?
All tokens and part-of-speech tags in the phrase as a bag of words?
The word-shape representation of the head word and the entire phrase, e.g.
Xxxxx 99 for the expression April 30  ?
The condensed word-shape representation for the head word and the entire phrase, e.g.
X(x) (9) for the expression April 30 ?
The concatenated string of the syntactic types of the children of the phrase in the parse tree ?
The depth in the parse tree  3.2 Lexical Resources for Bootstrapping Sparsity of annotated corpora is the biggest chal-lenge for any supervised machine learning tech-nique and especially for porting the trained models onto other domains.
To overcome this problem we hypothesize that knowledge of semantically similar words, like temporal triggers, could be found by associating words that do not occur in the training set to similar words that do occur in the training set.
Furthermore, we would like to learn these similarities automatically to be independent of knowledge sources that might not be available for all languages or domains.
The first option is to use the Latent Words Language Model (LWLM) (Deschacht and Moens, 2009) ?
a language model that learns from an unlabeled corpus how to pro-vide a weighted set of synonyms for words in con-text.
The LWLM model is trained on the Reuters news article corpus of 80 million words.
WordNet (Miller, 1995) is another resource for synonyms widely used in research and applications of natural language processing.
Synonyms from WordNet seem to be very useful for bootstrapping as they provide replacement words to a specific word in a particular sense.
For each synset in WordNet there is a collection of other ?sister?
syn-sets, called coordinate terms, which are topologi-cally located under the same hypernym.
3.3 Bootstrapping Strategies Having a list of synonyms for each token in the sentence, we can replace one of the original tokens by its synonym while still mostly preserving the sentence semantics.
We choose to replace just the headword, under the assumption that since tempo-ral trigger words usually occur at the headword position, adding alternative synonyms for the headword should allow our model to learn tempo-ral triggers that did not appear in the training data.272We designed the following bootstrapping strate-gies for generating new temporal expressions: ?
LWLM: the phrasal head is replaced by one of the LWLM synonyms.
?
WordNet 1st Sense: Synonyms and coordinate terms for the most common sense of the phrasal head are selected and used for generat-ing new examples of time expressions.
?
WordNet Pseudo-Lesk: The synset for the phrasal head is selected as having the largest intersection between the synset?s words and the LWLM synonyms.
Then, synonyms and coordinate terms are used for generating new examples of time expressions.
?
LWLM+WordNet: The intersection of the LWLM synonyms and the WordNet synset found by pseudo-Lesk are used.
In this way for every annotated time expression we generate n new examples (n?
[1,10]) and use them for training bootstrapped classification models.
4 Experimental Setup The tested model is trained on the official Tem-pEval 2010 training data with 53450 tokens and 2117 annotated TIMEX3 tokens.
For testing the portability of the model to other domains we anno-tated two small target domain document collec-tions with TIMEX3 tags.
The first corpus is 12 Reuters news articles from the Reuters corpus(Lewis et al, 2004), containing 2960 total tokens and 240 annotated TIMEX3 tokens (inter-annotator agreement 0.909 F1-score).
The second corpus is the Wikipedia article for Barak Obama (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama), containing 7029 total tokens and 512 annotated TIMEX3 to-kens (inter-annotator agreement 0.901 F1-score).
The basic TempEval model is evaluated on the source domain (TempEval 2010 evaluation set ?
9599 tokens in total and 269 TIMEX3 annotated tokens) and target domain data (Reuters and Wikipedia) using the TempEval 2010 evaluation metrics.
Since porting the model onto other do-mains usually causes a performance drop, our ex-periments are focused on improving the results by employing different bootstrapping strategies1.
5 Results The recognition performance of the model is re-ported in Table 1 (column ?Basic TempEval Mod-el?)
for the source and the target domains.
The basic TempEval model itself achieves F1-score of 0.834 on the official TempEval 2010 evaluation corpus and has a potential rank 8 among 15 par-ticipated systems.
The top seven TempEval-2 sys-tems achieved F1-score between 0.83 and 0.86.

Bootstrapped models were asked to generate between one and ten additional train-ing examples per instance.
The maximum P, R, F1 and the number of synonyms at which this maximum was achieved are given in the P, R, F1 and # Syn rows.
F1 scores more than 0.010 above the Basic Tem-pEval Model are marked in bold.273However, this model does not port well to the Reuters corpus (0.773 vs. 0.834 F1-score).
For the Wikipedia-based corpus, the basic TempEval mod-el actually performs a little better than on the source domain (0.859 vs. 0.834 F1-score).
Four bootstrapping strategies were proposed and evaluated.
Table 1 shows the maximum F1 score achieved by each of these strategies, along with the number of generated synonyms (between one and ten) at which this maximum was achieved.
None of the bootstrapped models outperformed the basic TempEval model on the TempEval 2010 evalua-tion data, and the WordNet 1st Sense strategy and the WordNet Pseudo-Lesk strategy never outper-formed the basic TempEval model on any corpus.
However, for the Reuters and Wikipedia cor-pora, the LWLM and LWLM+WordNet bootstrap-ping strategies outperformed the basic TempEval model.
The LWLM strategy gives a large boost to model performance on the Reuters corpus from 0.773 up to 0.826 (a 23.3% error reduction) when using the first 5 synonyms.
This puts performance on Reuters near performance on the TempEval domain from which the model was trained (0.834).
This suggests that the (Reuters-trained) LWLM is finding exactly the right kinds of synonyms: those that were not originally present in the TempEval data but are present in the Reuters test data.
On the Wikipedia corpus, the LWLM bootstrapping strat-egy results in a moderate boost, from 0.859 up to 0.874 (a 10.6% error reduction) when using the first three synonyms.
Figure 1 shows that using more synonyms with this strategy drops perform-ance on the Wikipedia corpus back down to the level of the basic TempEval model.
The LWLM+WordNet strategy gives a moderate boost on the Reuters corpus from 0.773 up to 0.796 (a 10.1% error reduction) when four synonyms are used.
Figure 2 shows that using six or more syno-nyms drops this performance back to just above the basic TempEval model.
On the Wikipedia corpus, the LWLM+WordNet strategy results in a moder-ate boost, from 0.859 up to 0.877 (a 12.8% error reduction), with five synonyms.
Using additional synonyms results in a small decline in perform-ance, though even with ten synonyms, the per-formance is better than the basic TempEval model.
In general, the LWLM strategy gives the best performance, while the LWLM+WordNet strategy is less sensitive to the exact number of synonyms used when expanding the training data.
6 TempEval Error Analysis We were curious why synonym-based boot-strapping did not improve performance on the source-domain TempEval 2010 data.
An error analysis suggested that some time expressions might have been left unannotated by the human annotators.
Two of the authors re-annotated the TempEval evaluation data, finding inter-annotator agreement of 0.912 F1-score with each other, but only 0.868 and 0.887 F1-score with the TempEval annotators, primarily due to unannotated time ex-pressions such as 23-year, a few days and third-quarter.Figure 1: F1 score of the LWLM bootstrapping strat-egy, generating from zero to ten additional training examples per instance.Figure 2: F1 score of the LWLM+WordNet bootstrap-ping strategy, generating from zero to ten additional training examples per instance.274Using this re-annotated TempEval 2010 data2, we re-evaluated the proposed bootstrapping tech-niques.
Figure 3 and Figure 4 compare perform-ance on the original TempEval data to performance on the re-annotated version.
We now see the same trends for the TempEval data as were observed for the Reuters and Wikipedia corpora: using a small number of synonyms from the LWLM to generate new training examples leads to performance gains.
The LWLM bootstrapping model using the first synonym achieves 0.861 F1 score, a 22.8% error reduction over the baseline of 0.820 F1 score.
7 Discussion and Conclusions We have presented model-portability experiments on time expression recognition with a number of bootstrapping strategies.
These bootstrapping strat-egies generate additional training examples by substituting temporal expression words with poten-tial synonyms from two sources: WordNet and the Latent Word Language Model (LWLM).
Bootstrapping with LWLM synonyms provides a large boost for Reuters data and TempEval data and a decent boost for Wikipedia data when the top few synonyms are used.
Additional synonyms do not help, probably because they are too newswire-specific: both the contexts from the TempEval training data and the synonyms from the Reuters-trained LWLM come from newswire text, so the2 Available at http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/groups/liir/software.phplower synonyms are probably more domain-specific.
Intersecting the synonyms generated by the LWLM and by WordNet moderates the LWLM, making the bootstrapping strategy less sensitive to the exact number of synonyms used.
However, while the intersected model performs as well as the LWLM model on Wikipedia, the gains over the non-bootstrapped model on Reuters and TempEval data are smaller.
Overall, our results show that when porting time expression recognition models to other domains, a performance drop can be avoided by synonym-based bootstrapping.
Future work will focus on using synonym-based expansion in the contexts (not just the time expressions headwords), and on incorporating contextual information and syntactic transformations.
