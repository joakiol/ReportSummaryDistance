Co-occurrences of Antonymous Adjectivesand Their ContextsJohn S. Justeson*Slava M. Katz*IBM T. J. Watson Research CenterCharles and Miller propose that lexical associations between antonymous adjectives are formedvia their co-occurrences within the same sentence (the co-occurrence hypothesis), ratherthan via their syntactic substitutability (the substitutability hypothesis), and that such co-occurrences must take place more often than expected by chance.
This paper provides empiricalsupport for the co-occurrence hypothesis, in a corpus analysis of all high-frequency adjectivesand their antonyms and of a major group of morphologically derived antonyms (e.g., im-possible, un-happy).
We show that very high co-occurrence rates do appear to characterizeall antonymous adjective pairs, supporting the precondition for the formation of the association;and we find that the syntactic ontexts of these co-occurrences raise the intrinsic associability ofantonyms when they do co-occur.
We show that via one of these patterns, mutual substitutionwithin otherwise repeated phrases in a sentence, the co-occurrence hypothesis captures thegeneralizations that were the basis for the substitutability hypothesis for the formation ofantonymic associations.1.
Antonymic AssociationMuch current research in linguistics is concerned with textual or discourse bases forlinguistic structure; within lexical semantics, uch research is directed at particular lex-ical relations and at correlations between syntax and semantics.
This paper addressesthe textual underpinnings of antonymy between predicative adjectives, following upresearch reported by Charles and Miller (1989).Antonymy is a special exical association between word pairs.
That it is lexical andnot simply semantic follows from the fact that different words for the same conceptcan have different antonyms; for example, big-little and large-small are good antonympairs, but large-little is not.
The classic work on associations among adjectives, andbetween antonymous adjectives in particular, is by Deese (1964, 1965), analyzing theresults of stimulus-response word-association tests.
1Charles and Miller (1989) argue,contrary to more complex psycholinguistic theories, that the primary source of theseassociations i a tendency they hypothesize for antonyms to co-occur within the samesentences in discourse.
This paper supports and extends their hypothesis.Deese's work on word association for adjectives was based on a list of the 278 mostfrequent adjectives in the Thorndike-Lorge (1944) count, those having a frequency of50 per million or more.
Thirty-four pairs of these words had a reciprocal property: eachmember of the pair was the most frequent response to the other on word-association?

(~) 1991 Association for Computational LinguisticsComputational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 1tests.
These pairs were all antonymic (e.g., good-bad, big-little, large-small).
Essentiallyreciprocal were 5 additional antonym pairs overlapping with these 34: easy-hard (cf.hard-soft), heavy-light (cf.
light-dark), left-right (cf.
right-wrong), long-short (cf.
short-tall),and new-old (cf.
old-young).
For these pairs, member A has B as its most frequentresponse, while B is the second :most frequent response to A (A's most commonresponse being its antonym in the original list of 34 pairs).A general finding of word-association studies is that the part of speech of theresponse usually agrees with that of the stimulus.
Deese's data are consistent withthis, and suggest further that at least the most frequent antonymous adjectives areassociated more directly with each other than with other adjectives.
Deese (evidently)did not find antonymic responses to be the most frequent for some 200 of the 278 ad-jectives he studied.
These were generally of lower frequency than those that were eachother's most common responses; Deese (1962, 1964:347) showed that the most commonresponses to lower-frequency adjectives are typically nouns that those adjectives oftenmodify, as in administrative decision, cited by Deese and actually used in the BrownCorpus (see Section 2.1).
In addition, the words with reciprocal responses were almostall morphologically simple and etymologically native (i.e., of Old English origin).In human contingency judgment studies (see Shanks and Dickinson 1987 for arecent review), the formation of associations among events is found to depend upontemporally close occurrence of the associated events.
Lexical associations, and in par-ticular the word pairs linked as stimulus and response in word-association tests, havethus been accounted for by positing frequent emporal proximity of lexical access ofthe words involved; Charles and Miller contrast wo such accounts, the substitutabil-ity hypothesis, introduced by Ervin-Tripp (1961, 1963), and their own co-occurrencehypothesis.Because responses to higher-frequency stimuli in association tests tend to agreein part of speech, and because parts of speech are defined linguistically by mutualsubstitutability within a context, psycholinguistic accounts have sought explanationsfor antonymic associations as side-effects of part-of-speech associations; this is an eco-nomical kind of account, since part-of-speech agreement requires an explanation inany event.
The key idea of the substitutability hypothesis i  that the context in whichone word occurs in a sentence may call to mind other words syntactically substi-tutable in that context, so that substitutable words are activated mentally in closetemporal proximity.
Under such a hypothesis, the greater the syntactic and semanticappropriateness of a substitutable word in a context, the greater its mental activation.Part-of-speech agreement often suffices for syntactic appropriateness; and, intuitively,the use of an adjective that characterizes the position of a noun's referent in one regionof a semantic dimension seems sensible mainly when another egion cannot be ruledout as inconsistent.
Accordingly, antonymous adjectives hould frequently be calledto mind in each other's environment.Charles and Miller (1989) dispute the substitutability of antonymous adjectives,showing that their sentential contexts normally leave only one member of the pairplausible.
They suggest instead the simplest form of associative xplanation, that theforms in question do in fact tend to co-occur in close temporal contiguity - -  in partic-ular, that antonymous adjectives occur more frequently than expected by chance in thesame sentence.
As supporting evidence they provide counts showing a higher thanexpected number of sentences containing both members of each of the antonym pairsbig-little, large-small, public-private, and strong-weak; 2 they conclude that it is sentential2 They also hypothesize that adjective pairs that are semantically opposite but not antonymic, oneJusteson and Katz Co-occurrences ofAntonymous Adjectivesco-occurrence alone that is responsible for the associative pairing of antonymous adjec-tives.
This paper confirms that, for all adjectives frequent enough to judge, antonymousadjectives do co-occur within the same sentence much more often than is expected bychance.
On the other hand, something like the substitutability hypothesis must alsobe involved: when antonyms do co-occur, they usually substitute for one another inclausal or phrasal contexts that are otherwise word-for-word repetitions of each other,apart from pronominalization or ellipsis in some cases.
We propose that, while train-ing for antonym association takes place via co-occurrence, it is their substitution inrepeated contexts that makes this training particularly effective.2.
Co-occurrences among AntonymsThis section shows that adjectives do indeed tend to occur in the same sentence astheir antonyms far more frequently than expected by chance.
Using the 1,000,000-word Brown Corpus, Charles and Miller (1989) tested this hypothesis for four pairs ofantonyms: big-little, large-small, strong-weak, and public-private, the first three pairs beingamong Deese's list of reciprocally-associated antonyms.
We verify their results for thesefour pairs, and extend the demonstration to encompass all of the Deese antonyms.
Ona class basis, we extend it to encompass all pairs of antonymous adjectives for whichat least one member has an adjectival frequency comparable to the Deese antonymsand to a major group of morphologically antonymous adjectives.
For all three groupsof adjective pairs, antonyms turn out to co-occur sententially roughly 10 times asoften as expected by chance.
These results are obtained mainly from a version of theBrown Corpus tagged by part of speech, and have been checked against an untagged25,000,000-word corpus of general iterature.2.1 Test CorporaOur work is based primarily on the Brown Corpus, a database containing 1,000,000words of English text balanced across 15 general categories, divided into 500 textextracts of about 2,000 words each; for a detailed description, see Francis and Ku~era(1982).
In the version we use, all words are tagged essentially by part of speech.
Thus,although the word back is used not only as an adjective but also as a noun, verb,and adverb, we are able to recover exclusively adjectival uses of the word from thecorpus.
The tagging system actually employs ome distinctions finer than simple partof speech, so certain adjectives receive special tags; for example, first and last are taggedas ordinal numbers rather than as adjectives.
On the other hand, some part-of-speechlabels are used more broadly than under most conventional grammatical descriptions.For example, past participles of verbs are tagged as such in both verbal and adjectivaluse; thus, married is not marked as an adjective in the corpus although it does occuradjectivally (e.g., a married couple).
For simplicity, consistency, and replicability, weconsider only those adjectives marked with the standard adjective tag in the corpus.To test hypotheses concerning sentential co-occurrence of words, the corpus mustbe divided into sentences.
The Brown Corpus is divided by a special sentence-endingtag into a sequence of "pseudo-sentences."
We eliminate those pseudo-sentences thatare labeled as "headlines," since they rarely consist of full sentences.
Quantitativelymember being a synonym of an antonym of the other, are not directly associated, and suggest thatthese "indirect antonyms" have no special tendency to co-occur sententially.
They confirm thissuggestion for four pairs they take to be good indirect antonyms: powerful-weak, strong-faint, big-small,large-little.
In none of these cases do they find a substantial excess of sentential co-occurrences overwhat is expected by chance.
For further discussion see Gross, Fischer and Miller (1989).Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 1this has little effect; their inclusion would add less than 1% to the 54,717 sentencesthat remain.
In a sample checked for incorrect sentence divisions, we found that allwere cases of premature division, none of sentence joins; these errors are mainly listelements, separated by semicolons, that are treated as sentences, and subject-verb seg-ments that are separated from quoted speech by either exclamation points or questionmarks.As a result of these errors, some of the ratios we report of observed to expectednumbers of sentential co-occurrences of antonyms may be somewhat higher or lowerthan they should be.
We have made no attempt o correct for any inaccurate sentencedivisions, finding that any increase is too slight to affect our results (and any decreasewill bias against the co-occurrence hypothesis).
If the reported ratios are higher thanthey should be, preliminary analysis shows that the increase is probably by no morethan 3%; if they are lower (which is less likely in general), the decrease is always bymore than 3% since the largest number of co-occurrences in our sample is 28.
Theco-occurrence hypothesis calls for high observed/expected ratios; a 3% increase inthese ratios does not significantly bias in favor of the hypothesis, since the ratios wecalculate are all more than 2:1 and average around 10:1.We have also checked our main results on the APHB Corpus, a much larger butgrammatically untagged corpus of 25,000,000 words, obtained from the American Pub-lishing House for the Blind and archived at IBM's Watson Research Center.
It consistsof stories and articles from books and general circulation magazines, such as Reader'sDigest, Datamation, and Fortune.
Sentence separation is less reliable than in the BrownCorpus, and words are not tagged by part of speech.
In addition, since the corpusis untagged, computations of the expected numbers of co-occurrences of antonymicadjectives are necessarily inflated except when nonadjectival use of both adjectivesis rare.
We used this corpus primarily to verify the results derived from the BrownCorpus, and for problems requiring a sample size much larger than 1,000,000 words.2.2 The Deese AntonymsFor 4 of the antonym pairs identified by Deese (1964) we have no evidence becauseat least one member of the pair does not occur with the standard adjectival tag inthe Brown Corpus: alone-together, few-many, first-last, and married-single.
These have noeffect on our counts.
For the remaining 35 pairs we have determined the number ofsentences containing each member of the pair; the number containing both members;the number expected to contain both members; the ratio of the observed to expectedco-occurrences; the rate of sentential co-occurrence; and the probability that as manyor more sentences would contain both members as were found to.
The results, givenin Table 1, show an overwhelming excess of observed over expected numbers of co-occurrences.
The following sentences are typical of the antonym co-occurrences:The group sets the styles in clothing, the kind of play engaged in, and the ideals ofright and wrong behavior.Soil redeposition is evaluated by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones.Originals are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily bad.Overall, antonym co-occurrence takes place in more than 8.6 times as many sen-tences as expected, 3 and co-occurrences are found for 30 out of the 35 pairs, in spite3 This estimate isprobably too low.
For one pair (old-new) the expected number of sentences (10.4)amounts to 39% of the total number (27.0) expected, and it happens to have the lowest ratio ofJusteson and Katz Co-occurrences of Antonymous  AdjectivesTable 1Deese's adjective pairs and their sentential co-occurrences in the tagged Brown Corpus.Sentential occurrences of an adjective is the number  of sentences in wh ich  the adjective occursin the corpus; this number  is g iven in co lumns 1 and  3, once for each member  of an antonympair.

10 -2of the  smal l  s ize  of  the  corpus .
For  most  of the  30 antonym pa i rs  exh ib i t ing  senten-t im co -occur rences ,  the  numbers  of  co -occur rences  are  s ta t i s t i ca l ly  s ign i f i cant :  25 areobserved to expected co-occurrences among all pairs for which any co-occurrence was observed.Excluding this pair as an outlier yields an overall ratio of about 11.0 times as many sentences asexpected with the co-occurrence.Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 1significant at the .05 level; 20 at the .01 level; and in 18, the probabil ity of obtaining somany co-occurrences i  less than 10 -4 .
The occurrence of nonsignificant results risesas the expected number  of co-occurrences declines.
This suggests that the nonsignif-icant results are attributable in part to sample size.
Indeed, testing in our larger butuntagged corpus of 25,000,000 words, all 35 pairs do yield highly significant numbersof co-occurrences.
4Antonym co-occurrence is a mass phenomenon affecting the entire Deese list; itis not due mainly to the contributions of a few cases with idiosyncratically high co-occurrence rates as a result of their having some special property.
We (over)control forthe possibility of undue effect of high co-occurrence numbers from particular antonympairs by computing the probabil ity that 30 or more of the 35 pairs would co-occur inat least one sentence; in this computation, high numbers of co-occurrences have noeffect.
This probabil ity turns out to be negligible, 7.1 x 10 -23.
A simulation provideda picture of the distribution of the number  of pairs having at least one co-occurrenceby chance; only 9.4 antonym pairs were expected to exhibit a co-occurrence, and innone of a million trials did even 20 pairs do so.To get an idea of the acquisitional consequences of these results it is useful toconsider the rates of co-occurrence being found.
The max imum number  of potentialsentential co-occurrences is the min imum of the number  of sentences containing eachmember  of the antonym pair; calculating the rate of co-occurrence as the proport ion ofobserved to possible co-occurrences, we find an overall rate of one co-occurrence every14.7 sentences.
At such rates, the language learner is repeatedly exposed to trainingfor the association.The co-occurrence rates are higher if one controls for word sense.
For example,only 24 of the 62 sentences containing the adjective sweet refer to taste or smell andthus readily contrast with sour; the others refer to attitudes, personalities, and music.This is most apparent in the case of the five adjectives that occur twice in the table,each with two different antonyms depending on the sense.
Taking account of this, thelow rate of I occurrence of short per 55 sentences containing tall rises to I occurrence oftall per 6 sentences containing short, since only 6 of the 187 sentences containing shortuse it to refer to height.
Similarly, in only 310-321 sentences does old relate to newness,as opposed to youth; s restricted to these sentences, the co-occurrence rate increases toat least one occurrence of new per 11.1-11.5 sentences containing a relevant sense of old,and the observed/expected ratio from 2.7 to a more typical 4.8-4.9.
The co-occurrencerate for old-young also rises, to one per 12.2-12.8 sentences, and the observed/expectedratio rises to 12.0-12.6.2.3 Other High-Frequency Antonym PairsIn addition to the words in Deese's list, we tested for sentential co-occurrence a set ofantonym pairs one of whose members  had a frequency of at least 50 in the 1,000,000-word Brown Corpus but that were not among the Deese antonyms.
This set wasconstructed as follows.
From a list of all adjectives with a frequency of at least 50, all4 The lower rates in the case of low-frequency adjectives cannot produce statistically significant results ina corpus of only 1,000,000 words.
Twelve of the 15 pairs that failed to produce statistically significantnumbers of co-occurrences in the Brown Corpus were among the 14 (40% of) pairs having the lowestco-occurrence rates in the 25,000,000-word corpus.
This is exacerbated by a weaker concentration f 13of these 15 pairs among the 21 (60% of) pairs having the lowest minimum adjective frequencies.5 The range is due to ambiguity in assignment ofcertain cases of old, as in He came to a stretch of oldorange groves, the trees dead, some of them uprooted, and then there was an outlying shopping area, and tracthouses.Justeson and Katz Co-occurrences of Antonymous Adjectivesadjectives were removed that did not seem to have any clear antonym, or that werecomparative or superlative.
For the remainder, one or more antonyms were placed ona candidate list.
This list was given to a professional lexicographer, who confirmedmost of the judgments and revised others.
The original ist, expanded by the additionsbut not reduced by the deletions made by the lexicographer, was then reviewed by alinguist specializing in lexical semantics.
Finally, the list as expanded by her judgmentswas similarly critiqued by an elementary school teacher.The set of 35 adjective pairs judged to be good lexical antonyms by all threereviewers we are confident in labeling as antonymic; analysis was restricted to these,at the expense of possibly excluding a handful of plausible candidate pairs.
6 Eleven ofthese antonym pairs 7 are morphological antonyms, that is, one member is derived fromthe other by a prefix of negation, in- (also in the forms il-, im-, ir-) or un-.
For a word pairwhose antonymy is morphologically marked, acquisition of the antonymy relation forthat pair does not require an associative hypothesis nvolving those particular words.We therefore treat morphological ntonyms separately (Section 2.4), and exclude themfrom the analysis of high-frequency, morphologically arbitrary antonym pairings.
Thisleaves a set of 24 new antonym pairs to test, at least one of whose members occursadjectivally in no fewer than 50 sentences in the Brown Corpus (see Table 2).
Twoof the 24 pairs on the list have no effect on the results.
Because past participles inadjectival use are not labeled in the corpus as adjectives, we lack data for the pairsopen-closed and theoretical-applied.
For the 22 pairs for which the corpus provides data,14 co-occur sententially.
The overall co-occurrence rate (once per 13.3 sentences) iscomparable to that (14.7) for the Deese adjectives; there is no significant difference asjudged by the X 2 statistic.
Again, word-by-word statistics confirm about half of thepairings to be statistically significant.
Again, nonsignificant results are for pairs withvery low expected co-occurrences, and their sentential co-occurrence rate is similar tothat for the significant (but more frequent) pairs.
Finally, the result is again not dueto any concentration f the observed cases in a few vocabulary items: for most pairsthe number of co-occurrences is quite small, and the probability that as many or morethan 14 of the pairs would exhibit at least one co-occurrence is negligible, 2.1 x 10 -1?.Simulation shows that the number of pairs expected to show a co-occurrence wasjust 2.9.A high rate of co-occurrence for antonyms i therefore validated not only for thoseadjectives that Deese showed to have the strongest reciprocal associative structure, butalso for antonyms involving frequent adjectives in general.2.4 Morphological AntonymsThis section addresses morphological ntonyms, adjective pairs in which one memberis derived from the other by an affix of negation.
In particular, we treat hose morpho-logical antonyms in which the derivation is by any of the most productive prefixesof negation (a-, ab-, an-; dis-; il-, im-, in-, ir-; un-; and non-).
8 Morphological antonymsrequire separate treatment because their lexical antonymy is recoverable morpholog-ically, hence their lexical association can be acquired differently from that betweennonmorphological antonyms.

For 27 of these pairs (e.g., famous-infamous), our judgment  was that their morphologica l  n tonymy does not  entai l  seman-tic oppositeness;  9 these spur ious  pairs were excluded from considerat ion.

Our analysis therefore concernsthe 346 semantically and morphologically antonymous adjective pairs for which eachmember occurs in the corpus.Overall, adjectives on this list have very low frequencies; in fact, 36 (10%) of themorphologically positive and 154 (45%) of the morphologically negative adjectives oc-cur only once in the corpus.
With frequencies so low, both the expected and observedsentential co-occurrences of these antonyms are too low to test the co-occurrence hy-pothesis on a word-by-word basis, so we test them instead on a class basis.
In this re-spect, the excess of observed over expected co-occurrences again turns out to be highlysignificant.
The overall ratio of observed to expected co-occurrences, 34.5 (74/2.1), ismuch higher than the estimates of 8 to 11 times the expected number of co-occurrencessuggested by the higher-frequency sets of antonym pairs.
Furthermore, 48 of theseantonyms co-occur in at least one sentence in the corpus.
Computation of the prob-ability of observing co-occurrences for at least 48 of the 346 pairs is intractable, sowe estimate it using simulation; only 2.0 antonym pairs are expected to co-occur, andin only one of 1,000,000 trials did as many as 11 pairs co-occur.
The probability of48 or more pairs co-occurring by chance is therefore negligible; since the tail of thedistribution drops rapidly, that probability is certainly far less than 10 -6 .
In summary,the co-occurrence of morphologically-expressed antonyms as a group is highly sig-nificant.
Note that the frequencies are so low for most adjectives that there can beno training by textual co-occurrence for most morphological adjective pairs during ahuman lifetime, so the class phenomenon is acquisitionally pertinent at most to themorphological pattern.2.5 Co-occurrence RatesThe analysis above shows that antonyms co-occur sententially far more often thanexpected by chance.
It demonstrates this both on a pair-by-pair basis, for adjectivepairs whose members are frequent enough, and on a class basis, for each group ofantonyms we investigated.There is substantial variation among antonym pairs, for the Deese group andfor the other high-frequency adjectives, in the rates of sentential co-occurrence ofantonyms; among pairs for which fairly stable estimates can be made (explicitly, thosehaving 10 or more co-occurrences), co-occurrences take place an average of once every12.5 sentences, with a range from once per 4.4 to once per 22.8 sentences.
Nonetheless,both of the antonym groups involving high-frequency adjectives as well as the (mostlylow-frequency) morphological ntonyms have quite similar overall co-occurrence rates:once per 14.7 sentences for the Deese group, once per 13.3 sentences for the other high-frequency antonyms, and once per 18.2 sentences for the morphological antonyms.These rates do not differ significantly; comparing all three yields a X 2 of 4.3947 with2 degrees of freedom (p - 11%).

Furthermore, there is some constancy even to thehuman-inhuman; terminable-interminable; conscionable-unconscionable; founded-unfounded.
Perhaps moredebateably excluded were measurable-immeasurable; calculable-incalculable; credible-incredible;definable-indefinable; subordinate-insubordinate; respective-irrespective; canny-uncanny; clean-unclean;easy-uneasy.10 Separating the morphological adjectives from the others as possibly different in kind, the differencebetween the Deese group and the other antonym pairs involving high-frequency adjectives yields a X 2of 0.6959 with one degree of freedom (p ~ 40%); grouping these two against the morphologicalantonyms yields a X 2 of 3.6663 with one degree of freedom (p ~ 5.6%).
This second ifference isonthe borderline of statistical significance, suggesting that nonmorphological antonym pairs may co-occurat a slightly higher ate than do morphological adjectives.Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 1variations in co-occurrence rate characterizing specific antonym pairs: rates in theAPHB Corpus are in good agreement with those in the Brown Corpus, after adjustingfor the inclusion of nonadjectival instances of some of the words (e.g., little is usedadverbially about twice as often as it is used adjectivally) and for a slightly loweroverall co-occurrence rate in the larger corpus.
Co-occurrence rates therefore seem tobe a relevant way of characterizing the co-occurrence phenomenon; they are also intu-itively clear, being sample conditional probabilities for the occurrence of an adjectivegiven the occurrence of its less frequent antonym.In contrast, the three groups show substantially different overall ratios of observedto expected co-occurrences: 8.6 for the Deese group, 23.5 for the other high-frequencyantonyms, and 34.5 for morphological antonyms.
These differences, given the essen-tially constant co-occurrence rates, are due to differences in the overall frequenciesof adjectives in the three groups.
Let N be the total number of sentences in the cor-pus, nl,i the number containing the more frequent adjective in pair i, n2, i the numbercontaining the less frequent adjective in that pair; and let fm,i = n~, JN  be the cor-responding relative frequencies, where m = 1 or 2.
Then for any given antonym pairi, the rate r~ and the ratio p~ are related as r~ = f~#p~.
Using this relation, simplealgebraic manipulation shows that: the overall rate ~ and the overall ratio ~ are re-lated as ~ =f lP ,  where fl = Y~i f l#(d2#/~j  h,j) (the average of the higher antonymfrequencies weighted by the lower antonym frequencies).
Antonym sets with system-atically higher fl,i distributions (which are positively correlated with the f2,i distri-butions) therefore have lower observed/expected ratios.
This again suggests that therelatively constant co-occurrence rates are a more appropriate way to characterize theco-occurrence phenomenon.3.
Syntactic Contexts of Co-occurrencesCharles and Miller (1989) demonstrated that both the sentential and the noun phrasecontexts of an adjective differ from those of its antonym in sentences in which onlyone or the other appears; in such sentences, antonymic adjectives are not readily sub-stitutable for one another.
However, Charles and Miller did not address entences inwhich antonyms do co-occur.
This section examines these sentences for the antonymsdiscussed in Section 2.
We find that, in sentences containing both members of anantonym pair, the antonymic adjectives are usually syntactically paired, and in thesecases they are commonly found in conjoined phrases that are identical or nearly iden-tical, word for word, except for the substitution of one antonym for the other:That was one more reason she didn't look forward to Cathy's visit, short or long;Under normal circumstances, he had a certain bright-eyed all-American-boy charm,with great appeal for young ladies, old ladies, and dogs.There was good fortune and there was bad and Philip Spencer, in handcuffs andankle irons, knew it to be a truth.The Brown Corpus contains 229 sentences with co-occurrences of both membersof at least one of the Deese antonym pairs.
Six of these sentences have members oftwo pairs, as inPre-decoration, low-cost molds, and the freedom to form large and small, thick andthin materials make plastics tailor-made for the industry.10Justeson and Katz Co-occurrences of Antonymous Adjectivesand two have two instances of the same pair.
This yields 237 sentence/co-occurrencetokens to classify syntactically.
A classification of antonym co-occurrences accordingto surface syntactic similarity is given in Table 3.
The sentences in which antonyms co-occur have diverse structures, as well as diverse structural posit ions for the antonyms.In spite of the diversity, we find a strong trend for the antonyms to occur in syntac-tically parallel and usual ly lexically identical structures.
Eighteen co-occurrences werate as "accidental," 219 as involv ing direct contrast.
11 Excluding the accidental cases,63% (139/219) of antonym co-occurrences are in lexically identical structures.
In 42%(58/139) of these co-occurrences, the antonyms themselves are s imply conjoined: 12She felt cold and hot,  sticky and chilly at the same time.39% (54/139) of them occur in repeated noun or preposit ional phrases, word- for -wordidentical apart f rom substitution of the antonyms for each other along with optionaldeletion or pronominal izat ion of some repeated words:.

Most of these cases appear simply fortuitous, e.g., The work uses the old eighteenthcentury tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano, and It is possible thatespecially large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limited to a small area.
More difficult to classifyare five or six examples in which the use of the polar terms does not involve their semantic ontrast,though deliberate selection of the adjectives based on their antonymy is plausible or probable, e.g.,That cold, empty sky was full of fire and light, and Its high impact strength, even at low temperatures, resistschipping, cracking, and crazing, according to DuPont.12 Many antonym pairs overwhelmingly favor a particular order of presentation when they co-occur inthe special patterns.
For example, all 16 instances of good co-occurring with bad, which all occur inadjective-conjunction-adjective or in conjoined identical short noun phrases, are in the order good, bad;similarly, in all 30 cases of immediately conjoined morphological ntonyms in our sample, theunmarked-marked or er is exceptionless.
In general, the more frequent adjective precedes its lessfrequent antonym and, correlatively, the unmarked precedes the marked where markedness clearlyapplies.
This is consistent with Fenk-Oszlon's (1989) results concerning order and frequency in frozenphrases consisting of two conjoined words: in 84% of pairs, the higher-frequency member precedes thelower.11Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 1Together, these two patterns amount o 51% (112/219) of all co-occurrences.Fully 164 (75%) of these 219 co-occurrences appear in conjoined syntactic struc-tures.
The pattern is even more characteristic of the 139 identical repeated phrases,117 (84%) appearing in conjoined structures.
Eighty-seven (63%) of the 139 identicalphrases appear in an even more striking pattern, the phrases themselves occurring inimmediate conjunction with each other, comprising 40% of the total 219 co-occurrences.More than half of the remaining 80 co-occurrences are similar to the 139 in lexicallyidentical structures in that they are found in highly parallel and strongly contrastivephrases.
For example, 16 of the co-occurrences could have been grouped with theidentical structures except hat two contrasting nouns also substitute for each other,as inThe old shop adage still holds: a good mechanic is usually a bad boss.Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain.The pain seems hort and the pleasure seems long.This special group occurs in conjoined structures at the same rate as the lexicallyidentical group.
Even the less tightly parallel examples exhibit quite strong contrastiveparallelism, e.g.,For example, a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large teethfrom another.In their search for what turned out to be the right breakfast china but the wrongtable silver, they opened every cupboard oor...There was nothing specifically wrong with Edythe, but there was absolutelynothing right about her either.We have separately classified the other antonyms involving high frequency adjectivesand the morphological antonyms according to these categories (see correspondingcolumns in Table 3).
For the high-frequency group, there is no statistically significantdifference in the proportions of cases that occur as an antonym pair joined by con-junction, lexically identical phrases with antonym substitution, or conjoined phrases.For morphological antonyms, antonym pairs joined by conjunction are almost twiceas frequent, accounting for 42% (31/74) of the co-occurrences.
Controlling for thisdifference, the proportion of co-occurrences in otherwise identical phrases and theproportion in conjoined phrases is the same as for the other two groups.Analysis of a sample of random adjective co-occurrences shows that the distribu-tion of antonymous adjectives across sentence structures is atypical of adjective pairsgenerally; see Table 3.
To determine this, we selected 250 sentences at random fromamong those having at least two adjectives, and randomly selected two adjectivesfrom each of those sentences.
Seventeen sentences were removed from this list.
Onewas in fact an antonym pair, not pertinent o examination of nonantonymic usage.
In16 of these 250 sentences, the two adjectives elected were premodifiers within thesame noun phrase; usually this structure is semantically incongruous for antonyms,and it was not observed among our antonym co-occurrences, so these 16 were alsoexcluded.
This left 233 sentences with random adjective co-occurrences to comparewith the antomymic ases.
The result: of the 233 adjective pairs selected from these12Justeson and Katz Co-occurrences ofAntonymous Adjectives233 sentences, only 7% (16/233) occurred in lexically identical constituents, only 42%(97/233) occur in structures joined by a conjunction.
These percentages are drasticallylower than observed for any of the antonym groups.In summary, we have shown that antonyms co-occur sententially mainly by sub-stituting for one another in otherwise identical or near-identical phrases.
Repeatedphrases, which are bound to be linked to one another during processing, yield a word-for-word alignment - -  a pairing of their repeated or anaphorically related words thatinduces a direct pairing of the substituting antonyms with one another.
Most wordsco-occurring in a sentence are not directly paired by any mechanism highlighting theirco-occurrence; the direct pairing of antonyms gives them more salience as potentialassociates, amplifying the effect of co-occurrence in the formation of a lexical associ-ation between the antonyms.
Arguably, the mechanism of antonym pairing via wordalignment produces an immediate, short-term association that with repeated trainingmay stabilize into a long-term association.4.
Discussion4.1 A Co-occurrence Theory of Antonym AssociationCharles and Miller (1989) demonstrated that antonymic adjectives are generally notsubstitutable for one another in sentences containing only one member of the pair;and they pointed out that a lexical association between antonyms would result fromfrequent co-occurrence of antonymic adjectives in the same sentence, according togeneral association theory.
Grammatical class associations that may form on the basisof the usual sentential contexts of adjective occurrences evidently do not account forthe formation of the lexical association between antonyms pecifically.We have verified the conjecture that lexical antonyms co-occur sententially farmore than would be expected by chance.
We have also shown that this is a verygeneral phenomenon: it characterizes all antonym pairs involving a frequent adjective,whether or not they show strongly reciprocal responses in word-association tests.These results support the co-occurrence hypothesis for the formation of the lexicalassociation between nonmorphological ntonyms, in that both the existence of thephenomenon and its generality are crucial to this acquisitional hypothesis.Accordingly, sentences with antonym co-occurrences doseem to be the crucial onesfor understanding the formation of antonymic associations.
Based on our analysis ofthese sentences, we are able to elaborate the original co-occurrence hypothesis: wenow characterize the co-occurrence phenomenon ot simply in terms of its excessover chance expectation, but in terms of regular syntactic patterns that they exhibit;and we have identified a mechanism for association formation, antonym alignmentvia phrasal substitution.This is the essence of the theory we propose: co-occurrence takes place via sub-stitution, substitution yields antonym alignment, and alignment leads to association.It is crucially a co-occurrence theory - -  the improbably high rates of co-occurrenceof antonyms result in the formation of associations between them; furthermore, co-occurrence takes place mainly by substitution in repeated phrases, and phrasal rep-etition with a substitution of antonyms evidently occurs mainly when these phrasesoccur very near one another, particularly in the same sentence.
Perhaps less crucially,it is also a substitution (not substitutability) theory: phrasal substitution provides amechanism, antonym alignment, that yields an explicit pairing of the antonyms andenhances the efficacy of training on the association between them.Finally, these investigations have changed our understanding of what antonymyis.
To the semantic riterion for antonymy, opposition in meaning, we now add a lexical13Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 1criterion: improbably frequent substitution in nearby, otherwise ssentially identicalphrases.
Together, the semantic and lexical criteria define antonymy.
134.2 Acquisitional Implications of Textual Co-occurrenceAdditional results of this research provide further support for the co-occurrence hy-pothesis, while suggesting three factors connected with associative pairing as having aprimary influence on the formation of word associations generally and of antonymouspairing in particular.
The suggested factors are the overall rate of occurrence of a wordwith the stimulus word; the improbability of the extent of pairing under a hypothesisof chance; and the inherent associability of the word pairs when they do co-occur, apattern effect.
141.
One implicit assumption of a co-occurrence hypothesis for acquisition ofa lexical association is a high enough frequency of co-occurrence toprovide adequate training for the association.
We find mostly quite highrates of occurrence of adjectives with their antonyms, averaging aboutonce per 15 sentences having the less frequent member of an antonympair; and overall, about 1 sentence in 150 includes the co-occurrence ofan antonym pair from our study.2.
Such high rates should normally suffice to yield associations, but this isnot the case when they can occur by chance.
For example, mostsentences containing a given adjective also contain the word the, so thatthe article occurs with that adjective at a higher rate than does anygenuinely associated word, including an antonym.
Conversely, lowerrates of co-occurrence may be equally effective (provided they achievesome threshold assuring adequate training) if these co-occurrences aresubstantially more surprising (i.e., improbable under a hypothesis ofchance co-occurrence).3.
Finally, some contexts in which words co-occur highlight the fact of theirco-occurrence, increasing their inherent potential for formingassociations; uch contextual enhancement of associability may berequired for forming associations between infrequently occurring (orco-occurring) words.
We have found that antonyms habitually substitutefor one another in otherwise ssentially identical phrases within thesame sentence, and that this powerfully supports their association viaantonym alignment.
This is probably the single most important patternincreasing the efficacy of co-occurrence in fostering the development of alexical association between antonyms, and probably between members ofany one grammatical class.
Other patterns raise associability as well;adjacency, for example, is especially effective in raising the associabilityof members of different grammatical classes, such as nouns with theirmodifying adjectives.13 Judgments of the antonymy of specific word pairs are sometimes subjective and uncertain; often,responses are that a word pair is somewhat antonymous or that the words are fairly good or not sogood as antonyms.
The lexical criterion accommodates such uncertainty and gradability, sinceimprobability and co-occurrence rate are graded factors.14 An unusual number of textual co-occurrences, asmeasured by their observed to expected ratio, iscoming to be widely used by computational linguists as evidence for word associations.
For example,Wilks et al (1989) use this ratio as a criterion for establishing links between words in a semanticnetwork; Church and Hanks (1989) use the logarithm of this ratio as a measure for word association.14Justeson and Katz Co-occurrences of Antonymous AdjectivesUnder this formulation of the co-occurrence theory, acquiring the lexical relationof antonymy requires a certain amount of training for the association, and as thefrequency of adjectives declines, so must the frequency of training for its associations.On the whole, then, very infrequent training should result in weaker associations; moregenerally, adjective frequency should correlate with the strength of lexical associations.One consequence of this correlation for the formation of a lexical association betweensemantically opposed adjectives i that, as the frequency of adjectives declines, so doesthe proportion of those adjectives that have good antonyms (apart from morphologicalantonyms, which can be derived by rule with no associative training); we have verifiedthis gradient for adjectives in the Brown Corpus.
Another consequence is that semantic(especially synonymic) associations should be stronger relative to the lexical (especiallyantonymic) associations for lower-frequency adjectives.
This may account for Deese's(1962:82) finding that the frequency of an adjective stimulus on a word-association testcorrelates very strongly with the proportion of adjective responses that are antonymic.4.3 Word-Association Tests and Textual Co-occurrenceWe believe that frequencies of response to a stimulus on word-association tests canbe accounted for in large part on the basis of patterns of textual co-occurrence of theassociates of the stimulus word.
In particular, these frequencies depend not only on thestrength of antonym associations but on those of the entire range of words with whichthe stimulus has formed associations.
We illustrate the phenomenon using the antonympair good-bad; they co-occur 16 times in the corpus, which is highly improbable as achance effect (having probability 5 x 10-12), and all 16 co-occurrences are in highlyassociable syntactic patterns.
Finally, the co-occurrence rate as defined in Section 2,which is the conditional probability of encountering good in a sentence containing bad,is quite high (16/125), about once per 8 sentences.
All three of the conditions discussedin Section 4.2 are satisfied, promoting the formation of a strong association betweenthese words.
No other open-class word has so high a probability of being encounteredin a sentence containing bad.
In contrast, with five times as many sentences containinggood as bad, the conditional probability of encountering bad in a sentence containinggood is only one-fifth as high (16/682).
Furthermore, several other open-class wordsoccur more frequently than bad in sentences containing ood.
Among adjectives, nonehas a significantly greater than chance number of co-occurrences, and none occursin the high associability pattern of substituting adjectives in conjoined and otherwiseidentical phrases, so no other adjective competes strongly with bad as an associate ofgood.
Among nouns, however, a few (man, people, time, day) co-occur with good moreoften than bad does, and do so with greater than chance numbers of co-occurrences.While they cannot substitute phrasally for good in these sentences, as adjectives can,all of them often occur immediately following the adjective; we suppose that this closeassociation facilitates association formation, though probably not as dramatically asdirect substitution i context.
This leaves bad as the single strongest associate for good,but with more competition from other candidates than good had from other associatesof bad.
In Deese's word-association tests, bad was indeed a much weaker response(13/100) to good than good was to bad (43/100), though each was the other's mostcommon response.
This pattern is typical of Deese's antonyms: it is usual, though notexceptionless, for the more frequent adjective in an antonym pair to exhibit he lowerresponse frequency to its antonym; a substantially higher frequency normally entailsa larger number of significant textual associates.-We presume that this competition among a set of unequal lexical associates, andof these associates with semantically but not lexically associated words, can accountnot only for the high proportion of antonymic responses to high-frequency adjectives,15Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 1but also for the low proportion of antonymic responses to low-frequency adjectives.In particular, we have already suggested that nonmorphological ntonymic associa-tion must be quite weak in the case of very infrequent adjectives, due to insufficienttraining opportunities; and morphologically negative antonyms of low-frequency ad-jectives are almost always much lower in frequency than the base form.
Assumingthat such infrequent adjectives typically have quite limited semantic domains of rel-evance, they are apt to show repeated co-occurrence with nouns in noun phrases,especially in a particular type of corpus or a particular person's phere of activity andexperience.
Accordingly, it will usually happen that a few nouns premodified by agiven rare adjective have the highest co-occurrence rate and improbability factor ofany open-class word, and in corpora whose size reflects the language learner's earlyexperience with language, the antonym (which can hardly be other than a morpholog-ical antonym) will rarely or never have appeared.
In contrast, the highest-frequencyadjectives have extensive training opportunities, resulting in a great deal of experiencewith antonym co-occurrence, whose associative strength has the support of phrasalsubstitution; and competition from nouns and verbs is much more diffuse than inlower-frequency adjectives due to a usually broad range of applicability.
Accordingly,the three factors governing associative strength, together with competition among as-sociates of varying strengths, induce a correlation between the frequency of a stimulusadjective and the proportions of adjective vs. noun responses on word-association tests.Deese interpreted this correlation as reflecting a greater effectiveness of paradigmatic(same part of speech) associations at higher frequencies, and of syntagmatic (typicalor prototypical accompaniments) at lower frequencies.
It now appears that the oppo-sition between paradigmatic and syntagmatic s not directly relevant o the process ofassociation formation.
Rather, these are descriptively different effects of competitionamong all associated words; apart from possible differences in the efficacy of sub-stitution vs. adjacency in raising the associability of co-occurring words, and in therelative strengths of semantic vs. lexical associations in the paradigmatic and syntag-matic cases, the outcome of the competition is based on the same kinds of textualco-occurrence preferences for both paradigmatic and syntagmatic associates.4.4 Co-occurrence and SubstitutionThe factors discussed here, and their relations to word-association response frequen-cies, are quite general and thus likely to apply to other major word classes.
In fact,the two types of syntactic patterns characterizing most antonym co-occurrences oughtto produce associations of frequent words with other words having the same part ofspeech, because these contexts of word co-occurrence are specific to words agreeingin part of speech, is (1) Syntactically, conjunctions are explicit pairing devices, and thewords or constructions they join necessarily agree in grammatical c ass; the conjoiningof two words within a phrase thus provides training for a lexical association betweenwords of a single class.
(2) Similarly, when a given environment is literally repeatedin a sentence, except hat one member of a word pair occurs in one of them and an-other occurs in the same slot in the other, this usually guarantees grammatical classagreement between the substituting words; and the repetition with word substitutionresults in direct pairing of the substituting words and provides training for a lexicalassociation between them.
Both contexts also substantially raise the associability of theco-occurring words, so the training they receive should be effective.15 These syntactic ontexts may also aid in the acquisition of word morphology, through part-of-speechsubstitutions that exhibit the morphological variations.
We have shown that morphological ntonymyas a relation is amply trained via co-occurrence, though most individual pairs receive no training.16Justeson and Katz Co-occurrences of Antonymous AdjectivesWe conclude that the acquisition of antonymy in adjectives takes place by a processthat may contribute to the acquisition of associations between other words agreeingin part of speech: co-occurrences of words of a single grammatical class in two specialtypes of syntactic ontext that are characteristic of antonym co-occurrence.
Such a uni-fied account for antonymic and part-of-speech associations was the motivation behindthe substitutability h pothesis.
The syntactic ontexts that typify the co-occurrences ofantonyms introduce a restricted and especially noticeable form of substitutability intothe co-occurrence hypothesis - - actual substitution of associated words in a repeatedcontext.Appendix: Statistical CalculationsWe model the co-occurrence problem using the hypergeometric distribution for com-putation of expected values and probabilities of occurrence of as many co-occurrencesas observed.
Suppose there are N sentences in the corpus, nl of which contain adjec-tive 1 and Tt 2 of which contain adjective 2, and that k sentences contain both adjectives.To model this situation, we suppose that we have selected at random the nl sentencesto contain adjective 1and are now selecting the sentences to contain adjective 2.
Sincewe have k co-occurrences, we must select k sentences from among those containingadjective 1, and the remaining n2 -- \]~ sentences from among those not containingadjective 1.
There areways of choosing k sentences from among nl, andN-n1)n2 - kways of choosing n2 - k sentences from among N - nl; since the choices of sentencesfrom those containing adjective 1 are independent of the choices from those not con-taining adjective 1, the probability p(k) of choosing at random k sentences to containboth adjective 1and adjective 2 is( /? )
( N -n1  n2 ) ' nl n2_k) / (NThese probabilities form the hypergeometric distribution.
The expected value of k isnln2/N; this formula is used to compute the expected number of co-occurrences inTables 1 and 2.The probability P(k) of observing at least k co-occurrences ismin(nl ,n2) k-1E p(k) = 1 -  Zp(k ) .i=k i----0The values in the probability column of Tables I and 2 are computed using this formulafor P(k); this allows us to determine whether the observed number of co-occurrencesis unlikely to have been produced by chance.Using the above formula, the probability that the antonym pair in question hasat least one co-occurrence is P(1) = 1 -p(0).
Let j refer to the jth antonym pair,and pj (k) and Pj (k) the probabilities of k co-occurrences and at least k co-occurrences17Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 1respectively, and r be the total number of antonym pairs being considered.
Now, selects pairs, {J l , .

Call thisparticular combination c, an element of the set C~ of combinations of s out of the rpairs.
The probability qc that this particular combination would be found by chance isThe overall probability Qs that exactly s pairs will co-occur by chance is the sum~cc?~ qc; it consists of(:)such terms, one for each combination c in Cs.
Finally, the probability that at least tpairs have at least one co-occurrence is ~=t  Qs.This is the formula used to compute the probabilities of getting at least as manypairs co-occurring as we observe, in Tables 1 and 2.
However, the number of termsrequired for computing the probabilities Q~ become astronomical when r is large ands is not close to 0 or to r. This was the situation in our analysis of morphologicalantonyms (r = 346, s = 48) in Section 2.4.
In such cases, simulation must be usedto estimate ~=t  Qs.
The simulation proceeds as follows.
In each trial, r randomnumbers are generated, uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.
If the ith numberis greater than p~(O), then the trial produces a co-occurrence for pair i.
We keep trackof the number of such co-occurrences generated for each trial.
After 1,000,000 trials, wehave an approximation to the probability distribution for the number of co-occurrencesexpected to be produced by chance.
If k or more pairs never co-occur in 1,000,000 trials,the probability of so many pairs co-occurring is very likely to be smaller than 10-5;otherwise, the expected number of observations would be at least 10, the probabilityof having no trial with k or more pairs co-occurring would be less than 0.003.AcknowledgmentsThis paper owes its existence to productiveinteraction with George Miller, who broughtthe phenomenon of antonym co-occurrenceto our attention and provided very usefulcritical comments on the paper.
We havealso received helpful comments from TedBriscoe, Roy Byrd, Martin Chodorow, JudithKlavans, and Yael Ravin.
