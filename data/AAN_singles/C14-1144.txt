?Department of Linguistics and Beckman Institute?School of Library and Information ScienceUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA{alsabba1, girju, jdiesner} @illinois.eduAbstractWe present 3arif1, a large-scale corpus of Modern Standard and Egyptian Arabic tweets annotated forepistemic modality2.
To create 3arif, we design an interactive crowdsourcing annotation procedure thatsplits up the annotation process into a series of simplified questions, dispenses with the requirement forexpert linguistic knowledge and captures nested modality triggers and their attributes semi-automatically.1 IntroductionEpistemic modality, according to Palmer (2001), defines the speaker's subjective knowledge, beliefsand judgments about the world's states of affairs.
Epistemic modality is used as a linguistic feature formultiple NLP tasks and applications, including sentiment analysis (Abdul-Mageed and Diab 2011),opinion mining (Benamara et al.
2012) and scientific discourse evaluation (Waard and Maat  2012),among others.To-date, there are no large-scale modality-annotated Arabic corpora compared to English (Baker etal.
2010, 2012; Rubinstein et al.
2013), Chinese (Cui and Chi 2013), Portuguese (Hendrickx et al.2012) and Japanese (Matsuyoshi et al.
2010).
The creation of modality-annotated corpora is non-trivialbecause there is no consensus definition of modality and its attributes in theoretical linguistics to berendered into annotation tasks and guidelines.
Furthermore, most current modality annotation schemesrely on sophisticated theoretically-grounded guidelines that require annotators from linguistics back-ground; hence, annotation is usually restricted to small-scale in-lab settings.In this paper, we present 3arif, a large-scale Arabic corpus annotated for epistemic modality.
3arifcomprises 9822 unique tweets in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Egyptian Arabic (EA), annotat-ed for 9966 tokens that map to 214 unique types of epistemic modality.
Each epistemic modality isannotated for sense, polarity, intensification, tense, holder(s) and scope(s).
The reason that 3arif fea-tures the tweets' genre with an emphasis on MSA and EA tweets is that it comes as part of a largerproject to incorporate linguistic features, such as modality, with network-based features to automati-cally identify the key players of Twitter's political discourse in counties of political unrest such asEgypt.
We harvested 3arif from a variety of Twitter users including newspapers, TV stations, politicalcampaigns, among others, as well as individuals.
As a result 3arif is diglossic for MSA, the formalArabic variety, and EA, the native Arabic dialect of Egypt.For the annotation of 3arif, we design a simplified procedure that depicts the following ideas: first, itdefines each annotation task as a series of open and closed questions that do not require sophisticatedlinguistics background and, meanwhile, provide annotators with self-explanatory annotation guide-lines; second, it is interactive so that questions are displayed/hidden based on annotators' prior an-swers; and finally, it semi-automatically identifies and merges nested epistemic modality based on an-notators' answers to a number of easy-to-administer questions.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Results show high inter-annotator reliability and agreement rates and indicate that our annota-tion scheme and procedure are efficient.
The contribution of this research, therefore, is twofold: first,we create a novel resource for Arabic NLP which is expected to enhance research on modality auto-matic identification and extraction; second, we present an efficient and easy-to-administer annotationprocedure with interactive crowdsourcing potentials for the complex task of modality annotation.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines our annotation scheme includingannotation tasks, guidelines and the interactive structure; Section 3 gives examples for the representa-tion of the final annotation outputs; Section 4 describes corpus harvesting and sampling; Section 5 dis-cusses the results and presents a disagreement analysis; Section 6 compares and contrasts our work torelated work; and Section 7 highlights the points not covered in this current version of 3arif.2 Annotation SchemeOur annotation scheme consists of six tasks to label sense, polarity, intensification, tense, holders andscopes for each epistemic modality.
Prior to the beginning of the interactive annotation procedure, wehighlighted all candidate epistemic modalities in each tweet using a string-match algorithm and thelexicons from Al-Sabbagh et al.
(2013, 2014).
The algorithm finds all potential epistemic modalitytriggers (i.e.
words and phrases that may convey epistemic modality) within each tweet in our corpusand marks them as annotation units.
A total of 9966 candidate epistemic modality triggers are high-lighted in 9822 tweets.2.1 Task 1: SenseSense annotation is to decide for each highlighted candidate trigger in context whether it actually con-veys epistemic modality.
The same lexical verb ????
A$Er is used as an epistemic modality trigger an-ticipating a future possibility in example 1; but as a non-modal lexical verb in example 2.1.

?#hykl: A$Er bAlfxr wAlqlq >yDA fy *krY Hrb >ktwbr#Heikl: I feel proud but also worried when I remember October's war.We define sense annotation as a synonymy judgment task, following Al-Sabbagh et al.
(2013).
Epis-temic modality is represented by an exemplar set manually selected so that: (1) each exemplar is anunambiguous epistemic trigger, (2) exemplars are in both MSA and EA, (3) exemplars comprise bothsimple words and multiword expressions, (4) exemplars are both affirmative and negative, and (5) ex-emplars are of different lexical intensities.
Furthermore, we create multiple versions of the same set sothat we cover the inflections for gender, number, person, tense, mood, and aspect in Arabic.
We thenuse the set that morphologically matches the candidate trigger to be annotated.
Presented with a pre-highlighted candidate trigger in context and the exemplar set, annotators are to decide whether the giv-en candidate trigger is synonymous to the exemplar set, and is hence an epistemic modality trigger, ornot.If an annotator decides that a given candidate trigger does not convey epistemic modality, no furtherquestions about polarity, intensification, tense, holders or scopes are displayed.
To guarantee that an-notators do not select the non-synonymous option as an easy escape, they are not allowed to moveforward without submitting at least one synonym of their own to the candidate trigger.Designing the interactive procedure as such results in disagreement propagation.
If one annotatordecides that a given candidate trigger is not epistemic, but another annotator decides that it is, the for-mer will not have to answer any further questions about polarity, intensification, tense, holders orscopes; whereas the latter will have to provide answers for each of those annotation tasks.3 Throughout the examples, epistemic modality triggers are represented in boldface and scopes are in-between square brack-ets.15222.2 Task 2: PolarityTask 2 uses as input the candidates labeled as valid epistemic modality triggers in Task 1 and labelseach as either affirmative or negative.
An affirmative trigger indicates that the speaker holds the givenstate of affairs (i.e.
propositions) as TRUE; whereas a negative trigger indicates that the given proposi-tions are held as FALSE by the speaker.To decide on whether the polarity is affirmative or negative, annotators are instructed to look for theabsence/presence of such negation markers as:?
Negation particles such as ??
m$ (not), ??
lA (not) and ???
gyr (not), among others.?
Negation affixes like the circumfix m...$ in ????
mZn$ (I do not think).?
Negative polarity items like ????
Emry (never) and ??
???
lm yEd (no longer).?
Negative auxiliaries where negation is placed on the past tense auxiliary as in ?????
????
mknt$wAvq (I was not sure).?
Inherently-negative triggers that encode negation in their lexical meanings such as ?????
?mstHyl (impossible).Annotators are instructed that using multiple negation markers results in an affirmative sense.
Thus,???
??
????????
lys mn AlmstHyl (it is not impossible) means that the proposition is actually possibleaccording to the speaker.
Put differently, it means that the speaker holds the proposition as TRUE.
An-notators are required to give the reason for negation if they decide that a given trigger is negative.2.3 Task 3: IntensificationEpistemic modality triggers can have different lexical intensities (i.e.
intensities encoded in the lexicalmeaning of the word/phrase regardless of the context).
For instance, even without a context, Arabicspeakers know that ?????
mt>kd (I am/he is sure) expresses higher possibility than ???????
mthy>ly (Iimagine).
When used in context, the trigger's lexical intensity can be maintained as is.
Yet, it can alsobe amplified or mitigated by various linguistic means such as:?
Modification: adverbs like ?????
tmAmA (absolutely) and ??????
bAlfEl (indeed), among others,amplify lexical intensity; whereas mitigation can be caused by such adverbs as ??????
tqrybA (al-most) and ?????
gAlbA (most probably), among others.?
Categorical negation typically amplifies lexical intensity as in  ????
??????
m$ mmkn >bdA (it isnot possible at all).?
Emphatic expressions such as ??
qd (indeed) and ?????
wAllh (I swear), among others, lead to lex-ical intensity amplification.?
Coordination of two or more triggers usually results in intensity amplification as in ????
?????
?EArf wmt>kd (I know and I am sure).The annotators' task for intensification is to decide for each candidate labeled as a valid epistemicmodality trigger in Task 1 whether its lexical intensity is amplified (AMP), mitigated (MTG), or main-tained (AS IS).
During interactive annotation, annotators are asked to provide the reason for their selec-tion; that is, whether the lexical intensity is affected by an adverb, categorical negation, an emphaticexpression, coordination, or any other reason.2.4 Task 4: TenseIn this version of 3arif, we work on the present and past tenses only.
Thus, Task 4 is to decide for eachvalid epistemic trigger from Task 1 whether it is present (PRS) or past (PST).
Tense can be marked ei-ther morphologically by inflections and affixes or contextually by auxiliary verbs such as ???
kAn(was), among others.
Annotators are also required to give their reasons for selecting either PRS or PST.2.5 Task 5: HolderHolder annotation is to identify the holder of the epistemic modality which is the ?RATIONAL entitythat expresses its knowledge, beliefs or judgments about the world's states of affairs.1523Holders can be ?RATIONAL entities as in example 3.
The entity that is making the assumption thatthe former Palestinian president - Yasser Arafat - may have died of natural causes is the report issuedby the French government.3.

This means that we can have nested holders, according to Wiebe etal.
(2005) and Saur?
and Pustejovsky (2009), where we know about others' knowledge, beliefs andjudgments only though the writer or the Twitter user in our case.In example 5, the Twitter user quotes Elbaradei stating that he may run for presidency if the peoplewant him to.
That is, the holder of the epistemic modality is actually Elbaradei not the Twitter user.5.

#Jan25We can have two or more nested holders.
In example 5, we have two: the first is ElBaradei and thesecond is the Twitter user who is quoting ElBaradei.
Similarly, in example 6, we have two nestedholders: the first is the Egyptian National Party and the second is the Twitter user who makes the as-sumptions about the party's beliefs.In example 7, however, we have three nested holders.
The first is ???????
AlAxwAn (the MuslimBrotherhood) that holds as TRUE the proposition that the Military Council is conspiring against them.That belief of the Muslim Brotherhood is communicated to us through the politician ???
??????
AbwAlftwH (Abulfotoh) who is then the second holder.
Yet, Abulfotoh has not posted his assumptionabout the Muslim Brotherhood's belief on his personal account.
Instead, he has been quoted by anotherTwitter user, who is the third holder.7.

If not, more questions are displayed to determine: (1) who the real holder is; (2) whetherthe tweet is a(n) (in)direct quote (e.g.
there are direct quotation markers or such words as ???
qAl (hesaid) and ???
SrH (he declared), among others), or the tweet conveys the Twitter user's assumptionsabout others.1524When the holder is not the same as the Twitter user, annotators are asked to mark the boundaries ofthe linguistic unit that corresponds to the holder in the tweet's text, following the maximal length prin-ciple from Szarvas et al.
(2008), so that they mark the largest possible, meaningful linguistic unit.Hence, in example 8 the holder is the Islamist opponents in #KSA not only the Islamist opponents.8.

Modality scopes in Arabicare most likely realized as clauses, deverbal nouns or to-infinitives, according to Al-Sabbagh et al.(2013).
We use the same maximal length guideline from Task 5 so that the scope segment marked bythe annotators is the largest possible segment typically delimited by: (1) punctuation markers and (2)subordinate conjunctions such as ???
lAn (because) and ??
lw (if), among others.In the case of nested triggers as in example 9, where a trigger and its scope are both embedded inanother trigger's scope, the interactive procedure prompts the annotators to label each trigger and itsscope separately at first.
Afterwards, we automatically merge them as we further explain in Section 3.9.

In example 10, the trig-ger ?????????

Furthermore, annotators are given the guideline that two or more triggers - typicallyconjoined by a coordinating conjunction - can share the same scope as in example 11.
In the cases likeexample 11, each trigger and its attributes are first annotated separately and then once our system findsout that they share the same polarity, intensification, tense, holder, and scope, they are merged togeth-er as we show in Section 3.10.

The representation of example 15 reads as follows: the USER (i.e.
the Twitteruser) used to moderately hold as TRUE the proposition that the revolutionist candidates were unable tocompete for presidency.
We know that this is a past belief that the USER used to have because annota-tors have labeled the trigger ?????
tSwrt (I thought) as past (PST).
There are no nested holders giventhat the USER is the same as the holder.
The intensity value of MODerate comes from the fact that?????
tSwrt (I thought) is of a moderate lexical intensity being weaker than such epistemic triggers as?????
mtAkd (I am sure) and ????
EArf (I know) but stronger than such epistemic triggers as ???
AZn (Iguess) and ???????
mthyAly (I imagine).
Meanwhile, the lexical intensity of tSwrt is neither amplifiednor mitigated; hence annotators have given it an AS IS intensification label in Task 3.
Consequently, inthe final annotation output the original lexical intensity value has been used to represent how far theholder used to consider his/her belief as TRUE.15.

mrsy (Morsi)4, and (2) has at least one epistemicmodality trigger from the Arabic Modality Lexicons of Al-Sabbagh et al.
(2013, 2014).
Table 1 givesstatistics for the sampled corpus that comprises 9822 unique tweets, with 9966 candidate epistemicmodality triggers that map to 214 unique types.Tokens TypesEpistemic candidates 9966 214All words 175964 47696Table 1: Statistics for the sampled corpus5 Annotation Results5.1 Evaluation Methodology and MetricsOur annotation tasks are of two types: (1) Tasks 1-4 are label-based where there is a pre-defined set oflabels from which annotators choose; and (2) Tasks 5-6 are segmentation-based where the output ofthe annotation is a text segment.
For the segmentation-based tasks, we use an all-or-nothing method to4 A total of 304 unique English and Arabic hashtags are found in the sampled corpus.1527measure reliability and agreement: for segments to be considered as agreement, they must share boththe beginning and end boundaries.
We use Krippendorff's alpha ?
(Krippendorff 2011) as our inter-annotator reliability measure, following the most recent work on modality annotation for other lan-guages including English (Rubinstein et al.
2013) and Chinese (Cui and Chi 2013).
For more detailson Krippendorff's alpha and a comparison of inter-annotator agreement measures, we refer the readerto Artstein and Poesio (2008).5.2 ResultsWe use the surveygizmo services to implement our interactive annotation procedure given that theirsurvey structure is one that allows for using conditional branching and skip logic5.
We distributed thesurvey on Twitter and we had three annotators participating.
According to the short qualifying quizgiven at the beginning of the survey, all three participants are native Egyptian Arabic (EA) speakerswho have at least two-year experience with using Twitter.
They are also university graduates who,therefore, master Modern Standard Arabic.
None of the participants has a linguistics background.Table 2 shows alpha and agreement rates for each annotation task.
We measure the rates in four dif-ferent scenarios so that we can (1) estimate the effect of the inclusion of the NON-EPISTEMIC categoryagreement, (2) estimate the effect of disagreement propagation from Task 1, and (3) evaluate theguidelines and procedures for each annotation task separately.
The four scenarios are:?
w/NONE w/DP: candidates agreed upon as non-epistemic and disagreement propagating fromTask 1 are both included.?
w/NONE w/o DP: candidates agreed upon as non-epistemic are included, but disagreement prop-agating from Task 1 is excluded.?

sense annotation), only the second scenario is applicable: we cannot ex-clude the candidates agreed upon as non-epistemic because the target is to know how reliable the an-notation is with regards to distinguishing between epistemic and non-epistemic candidates.
It is thefirst annotation task, thus there is no prior disagreement propagation.
From Table 2, we derive the fol-lowing observations:?
Disagreement in Task 1 propagates ~ 0.05 to 0.1 disagreement for the other annotation tasks.?
Adding the agreed upon non-epistemic candidates yields up to ~ 0.2 gain for both alpha reliabil-ity and agreement rates.?
For an end-to-end automatic system that first identifies triggers and then their attributes, thebenchmark rates are those from the w/NONE w/DP scenario.5 http://www.surveygizmo.com/15285.3 Discussion and Disagreement AnalysisAmong the factors that lead to high inter-annotator alpha reliability and agreement rates are that: (1)the vast majority of negation is explicitly marked by negation particles that are easy to detect by hu-man annotators; (2) the vast majority of triggers are used without any amplification or mitigationmarkers; and (3) punctuation markers are surprisingly informative for marking scope boundaries anddirect quotations and, hence, holders.Sense-related disagreement is attributed to: (1) nominal triggers with main grammatical functions,(2) stative triggers, (3) opinionated-evidential triggers and (4) highly-polysemous triggers.The majority of epistemic triggers are adjunct constituents that add an extra-layer of meaning andcan be removed without disturbing the syntactic structure of their propositions.
Yet, in example 21,??????
AHtmAl (a possibility) is the grammatical subject of the proposition it modifies.
Most of the ex-emplars from Section 2.1 are adjuncts and, thus, none can be both a lexical and a grammatical substi-tute for ??????
AHtmAl (a possibility) in such a context.21.

yErf (he knows) and ????
ydrk (he realizes) invoke disagreement as towhether they indicate the acquisition of new information; that is, they literally mean perceive, or theymark confirmed beliefs as in be sure that.
For example 22, the annotators have two interpretations: (1)a non-modal interpretation that whoever says so does not perceive that the Supreme Guide cannotmake resolutions without the Brotherhood, and (2) a modal interpretation that whoever says so doesnot believe that the Supreme Guide cannot make resolutions without the Brotherhood.22.

yzEm (he claims) do not only mark reported speech, but al-so they communicate the reporter's own opinion about the truth value of the reported proposition.
Theyentail that from the reporter's perspective the proposition is FALSE.
Hence, annotators disagree as towhether yzEm and similar triggers should be labeled as epistemic or not.
We have eventually excludedsuch triggers as epistemic and have included them as evidential triggers for another corpus that is leftfor a future publication.Highly-polysemous triggers like ????
ymkn (can/possible) lead to disagreement because in many cas-es even the context is ambiguous.
In example 23, both interpretations of it is not possible that (epis-temic) and it is not doable that (abilitive) seem to be acceptable.23.

Negated holders as in example 24 perplex the annotators as to whether the negationscopes over the holder only or both the holder and the trigger.

Therefore, they select the USER as the only holder with zero nesting in example 26.Other annotators interpret them as referring to people in general but not necessarily with the USER in-cluded; and thus, they select two-level nested holders.26.

The one main disa-greement factor, however, is such contexts as ??????

Abtdyt ASdq (I started to believe).
While themajority of annotators agree that such contexts mark present tense knowledge, beliefs and judgments,some annotators consider them as past tense.5.4 Majority Statistics for 3arifBased on majority annotations, Table 3 gives statistics for 3arif in terms of sense, polarity, intensifica-tion and tense.
Furthermore, approximately 62% of the triggers have zero-nested holders (i.e.
the Twit-ter user is the same as the holder).
As for scope syntactic structures, they are distributed as 86% claus-es, 9% deverbal nouns and the rest are to-infinitives.Sense Polarity Intensification TenseEpistemic Non-epistemic True False Amplified Mitigated As is Present PastTokens 5591 4375 3425 2166 1083 330 4178 4399 1192Types 209 175 176 134 133 50 150 175 104Table 3: Majority statistics for 3arif6 Related WorkEpistemic modality has been the focus of many annotation projects for multiple languages.
Diab et al.
(2009) annotate three belief categories for English: (1) committed belief is when writers indicate thatthey hold propositions as TRUE, (2) non-committed belief is when writers hold propositions as FALSE,and (3) not applicable is when propositions are not denoting beliefs at all.
Interest is given to writers'beliefs only.
Thus, a default value for the modality holder is the writer, and nested holders are not an-1530notated.
Their corpus contains 10k words of running text from different domains and genres, includingnewswire, blog data, email and letter correspondence and transcribed dialogue data.
Inter-annotatoragreement rate is 0.95 including the NONE category where no belief markers exist.Baker et al.
(2010, 2012) simultaneously annotate modality and modality-based negation to buildmodality taggers to enhance Urdu-English machine translation systems.
Their annotation scheme dis-tinguishes eight modality types: requirements, permissions, success, effort, intention, ability, desiresand beliefs.
Originally, their annotation scheme labels three attributes for each modality type: triggers,holders and targets (i.e.
scopes).
Yet, holders have not been eventually labeled.
A unique feature oftheir annotation scheme is using a simplified operational procedure to label modality semantic mean-ings.
The procedure relies on a list of thirteen choices of the form of H (modal) [P true/false] where His a holder and P is a proposition or an event.
The annotators' task is then to select the best form to rep-resent the modality meaning of a given trigger.
Reported kappa ?
inter-annotator agreement rates are0.82 for triggers and 0.76 for targets.Rubinstein et al.
(2013) propose a linguistically-motivated scheme for modality annotation in theMPQA English corpus.
They attain macro alpha inter-annotator reliability rates of 0.89 and 0.65 forsense and scope, respectively.
Cui and Chi (2013) apply the same scheme from Rubinstein et al.
(2013) to the Chinese Penn Treebank and get alpha inter-annotator reliability rates of 0.81and 0.39 forsense and scope annotation, respectively.Al-Sabbagh et al.
(2013) annotate epistemic modality in MSA and EA tweets.
We attain kappa inter-annotator agreement rates of 0.90 and 0.93 for sense and scope annotation, respectively, for only 548epistemic tokens.Our annotation results, therefore, are comparable to the results in the literature.
Furthermore, our an-notation scheme is orthogonal to most of the aforementioned schemes.
However, the key differencesbetween our work and related work are:?
We annotate nested modality, unlike Diab et al.
(2009) and Baker et al.
(2010, 2012).?
We use a wider range of negation and intensification markers compared to prior work, especial-ly Al-Sabbagh et al.
(2013)?
We use interactive crowdsourcing with simplified guidelines, unlike in-lab annotations includ-ing Rubinstein et al.
(2013) and Cui and Chi (2013), among others.7 Uncovered Points in 3arifThe current version of 3arif does not cover modality entailment that example 28 illustrates.
The USERcriticizes whoever holds as TRUE the proposition that Egypt can blackmail UAE using the Iranianthreat.
This criticism entails that the USER holds the same proposition as FALSE.28.

[yxTY' mn yZn An [#mSr ymkn An tsAwm #Al<mArAt bwrqp #<yrAn]Whoever thinks that [Egypt can blackmail #UAE using #Iran] is wrong.We do not also cover the future tense, the interrogative, the imperative or the hypothetical moods.This is because they have different interpretations when it comes to intensification and polarity that wedo not cover in this version of 3arif but we will in future work.8 ConclusionWe presented 3arif, a large-scale corpus annotated for epistemic modality in MSA and EA tweets.
Weused a simplified approach that defines each annotation task as a series of questions, implemented in-teractively.
Our scheme covers a wide range of the most common annotation units mentioned in theliterature, including modality sense, polarity, intensification, tense, holders and scopes.
We deal withnested holders that are crucial in a highly interactive genre such as tweets where users frequently quoteothers and make assumptions about them.
We also automatically merge triggers with shared holdersand scopes based on elicited annotators' answers.
The annotation procedure yields reliable results andcreates a novel resource for Arabic NLP.
For future versions of the corpus, we plan to cover the points1531from Section 7.
3arif will also be used to train and test an automatic machine learning system to iden-tify epistemic modality and its attributes in MSA and EA tweets.ReferencesMuhammad Abdul-Mageed and Mona Diab.
