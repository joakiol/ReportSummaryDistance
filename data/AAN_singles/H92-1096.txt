DEVELOPMENT OF A SPOKEN LANGUAGE SYSTEMJohn Makhoul and Madeleine Batesmakhoul@bbn.com, bates@bbn.comBBN Systems and Technologies10 Moulton StreetCambridge, MA 02138PROJECT GOALSThe primary objective of this project is to develop arobust, high-performance spoken language system.
Wehave achieved this by integrating the BYBLOS speechrecognition system with the DELPHI natural anguageprocessing system to produce the HARC (Hear AndRespond to Continuous speech) system.RECENT RESULTSAchieved aweighted error ate of 43.7 on theofficial ATIS spoken language system (SLS)evaluation for the Feburary, 1992 workshop.This is the lowest error rate of all systemsevaluated.Achieved a word error rate of 9.4 on theofficial ATIS speech recognition (SPREC)evaluation for the February, 1992 workshop.This is the lowest error rate of all systemsevaluated.Achieved aweighted error ate of 33.9 on theofficial ATIS natural language (NL)evaluation for the February, 1992 workshop.This is not significantly different from theother top-scoring systems.The 1-best output of BBN's speechrecognition component, paired with SRI'snatural anguage component, achieved anweighted error rate of 39.9.Achieved an unofficial weighted error on theFeburary, 1992 test set of 39.23, the lowest(though unofficial) rate of all systems wecurrently know of.We developed and used a data collectionfacility to collect 2277 utterances from 62subjects.
We were the only site to reach thedata collection goals by the original deadlineof 1 September.We completed an initial version of a newDELPHI NL system, which incorporates asemantic omponent integrated with theunification-based syntactic grammar, butseparated from it.
This allows for multiplesemantic interpretations for a single parse,facilitates rule creation and debugging, andallows for both greater expressive power andgreater computational efficiency.We developed a fallback understandingcomponent for DELPHI which is composedof a fragment generator, a syntacticcombiner, and a frame combiner.
Thisfallback strategy was included in the systemused in the official evaluation.For our real-time decoder work, we sped upthe decoder so that it can run in real-rimewith a higher beamwidth, and, therefore,higher accuracy.We ported the real-time speech system to runon the SGI workstation.We developed tools for creating andestimating various types of statisticalgrammars.PLANS FOR THE COMING YEARFor the coming year, we plan to continue our work onimproving both the speech recognition perofrmance and thenatural anguage processing performance of the HARCsystem.
We will pay particular attention to the discoursephenomena that are so important in the ATIS domain, andwill take increasing advantage ofprobabilistic analysis atseveral evels of processing.
We will in particularinvestigate methods for automatic training of the NLcomponent.
We will also study more deeply theinteraction of the speech and NL components via the N-best interface.463
