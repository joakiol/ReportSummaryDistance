The syntacticanalysis is performed along classical generative principles, though with a deliberately simple outputas a list of index-value doublets, which the semantic module pr(messes using methods in an object-oriented framework.
The final representation is made of two types of object-centered structures : llrst,case-like, event level dated structures corresponding to the Input clauses; second, detailedrepresentation f the culTent state of an agent of the reference world, plus rccords tbr tile follow-up ofa task over time.
Uncertainty, imprecision and prevision are handled using specialized fields.
Thisframework is applied to the processing of daily naval reports in English.I.
In t roduct ionThe objective of the project is the processing ofmessages in English reporting the daily evolution ofnaval  s i tuat ion  in the Medi ter ranean.
Theinformation extracted is exploited for s i tuat ionmonitoring, maintenance of a historical database,formulat ion of previs ions,  and detect ion ofhighlights and anomalies.A report typically gives information on the activityof one ship during the past 24 hours; for example:"La Belle Poulc is performing oceanographicalmeasurement in the northern Mediterranean, while movingsouth at a speed of 5 knots.
La Belle Poule wasapproxinlately 40 nautical miles south of Ma.rseille at10:00, April 14.
"This example exhibits discursive information on thec.urrcnt activity and movement of the ship and aspatio-temporal  plott ing relative to a referencelocation.2.

Sh~ameThe ship frame indicates both the current state of aship and indications on its activity.The general structure of a ship frame is :- status, a boolean (active/inactive)- ongoing tasks- c o m p l e t e d  tasks.
This and the preceding fieldcontain pointers to instances of the class "task",whose fields are : type (an activity}, start date,intermediate {last recorded) date, end date andlocation.- temporary  information : current  location, and,when available : goal, destination, geographicaldirection, companion ship, and speed;- list of spatio-temporal plottings.1 3332.3.
Action frameActions {event-level representat ion) are instances ofthe subc lasses  of the class "action".
Modality va luesare attached :- to the action itself :- tempora l  aspect  : "previs ional",  "under-way","completed".- d e g r e e  of cer ta in ty  : "observed" ,  "certa in"(meaning given as certain; this is the defaultvalue) ,  "probable" ,  "possible",  o rdered  bydecreas ing cert~nty .- to the action parameters :- certainty, as above- precision : "exact", "approximate"2.4, lr~ference proceduresThe inference procedures,  implemented as methodsand demons,  perform the following tasks :- check and complete new information- manage correspondence between fields (e.g, betweenthe "goal" and "ongoing tasks" fields), tak ingmodality values into account- l ook  for bet te r  moda l i t ies  (uncer ta in ty ,imprec is ion)- l aunch previsions- try to conf i rm active previsions- signal sal ient and anomalous  points.Previsions can be explicit in the text (future action;goal or destination), or scenario-related.input \] ~ \[ercalion~nd I ~ \[ \] * f - -~  syntactic 11~ .1~,~,kluJ*o ~ -I~ filling out of ~ .a~t ln~" i '~f  .

IVhat is ~ted  frorn s~jntact~a kncxvledge?There have been deeply contrasted posit ions on therole of syntax.
It can be thought  of as a full-fledgedfirst stage, as an auxi l iary  which  is suff ic ient lyinformative ven when a complete syntactic st ructureper se (e.g.
an x-barred tree) is not bui l t  (conceptualanalysis : \ [Schank & Riesbeck 81\]), as a co-process inclose cooperat ion with semant ics  (since SHRDLU), asthe first in an ordered sequence of increasingly costlymeans (as suggested by \[Rau & Jacobs  87\], who thenlist slot-f i l l ing involv ing fi ltering, heur is t ics  whencho ices  a re  to be made,  and  genera l  domainknowledge).Grossly, syntax in itself  carr ies information on :- const i tuent  ordering and const i tuent  relat ionship- f lex ion  and syntact ic  funct ion (if the grammar  isre lat ional) .13ut more act ively,  syntact ic  ana lys is  backed bylexical semant ics ,  even if less sophist icated than inLFG or Mel 'cuk 's  model  for example,  can play anactive part  in sorting i tems out  and ascribing them anadequate  t rans lat ion,  as for prepos i t ions  with anident ical  meaning.
In fact, bes ides apply ing weil-formedness  rules,  the analyzer  and lexicon can dosome rear rangements  o as to have the job allprepared for case attr ibut ion to function nicely.4.
Semantic processingThe system first searches a c lause for an action in theverb doublet  or, if the verb has translated as "empty"(for verbs like "perform", conduct"),  in the tbllowingnoun phrase.
The field va luat ion mechan ism of theobject env i ronment  checks that  the action value doesbelong to the declared domain.
An instance of theact ion type is created, and the system fills its fieldswith the va lues  it f inds in the second e lement  of thedoublets; the condit ion on the first place \[preposition)is expressed as a parameter .
Domain  checking isagain performed.
A case-l ike structure is obtained.When t i le ac t ion  ins tance  has  completed  theva luat ion of its fields, it pours itself into an existingactive task of the same ship if available, or else into anew task  it c reates .
Temporary  data  {current334 2direction, destination, speed, company and goal) arereplaced without testing if the new values aredifferent.
If the new action is an activity rather thana movement, it will either merge into the lastrecorded task If it is the same or a compatible one, orwill generate a new task, If it is declared to becompleted, it is (re-)written into the completed-tasksfield after its status flag has been set to "Inactive".
If itis incompatible with an existing ongoing task, thattask is closedFor all of the above, a new modality for an alreadyvaluated field will be checked against the existingmodality : a "better" modality (e.g.
certain vsprobable} supersedes the previous one, whereas aworse one is anomalous and can be signalled.
Theprocessing of the above example thus results in thecrcaetion/updating of the following frames :Output lists :(<np,I.a-Belle-Pmfle>.<vp,empty>.<oceanographicalmet~smement>.

Related workThe principled appl ication of structured objectrepresentat ion to semantic  processing had itsoperational landmarks in Bobrow and Winograd'sKPd, and the systems developed by the Yale AI group(e.g.
\[Schank & Riesbeck 811\].
\[Itirst 87\] proposes anoveraU application of the object paradigrn, includingto synta?, rather in the spirit of {Srnall & Rieger 82\]'sand (Flnck 89\]'s word experts.
\[Fargues, Catach,I)ugourd 86\] use logic grammars, but with a semanticrepresentation based on networks \[Sowa's conceptualgraphs) rather than fi'ames.6.
ImplementationThe system is implemented in Objlog (\[Dugerdil 89\]), aframe language based on Prolog II and featuringmultiple inheritance with points of view, selectiveinheritance for value-sharing in relationships otherthan taxonomical ,  and dynamic facets.
Thegrammar Itself is written in Prolog It.
A menu-and-mouse interface has been developed for theIntexTogation module.7.
ConclusionI have tried to show that objects are a convenient andefficient way to implement semantic representationas well as analysis in a reasonably small domain.Syntax based on a moderately strict set of well-formedness condit ions and some init iative Inrenaming is an appropriate partner for such asemantic analyzer.Many thanks to Franqoise Picard at GI~TC forcollabol-ation and advice.
