Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 3?4,Sofia, Bulgaria, August 4-9 2013. c?2013 Association for Computational LinguisticsDeciphermentKevin KnightUSC/ISI4676 Admiralty WayMarina del Rey CA 90292knight@isi.eduAbstractThe first natural language processing sys-tems had a straightforward goal: deci-pher coded messages sent by the en-emy.
This tutorial explores connectionsbetween early decipherment research andtoday?s NLP work.
We cover classic mili-tary and diplomatic ciphers, automatic de-cipherment algorithms, unsolved ciphers,language translation as decipherment, andanalyzing ancient writing as decipher-ment.1 Tutorial OverviewThe first natural language processing systems hada straightforward goal: decipher coded messagessent by the enemy.
Sixty years later, we have manymore applications, including web search, ques-tion answering, summarization, speech recogni-tion, and language translation.
This tutorial ex-plores connections between early deciphermentresearch and today?s NLP work.
We find thatmany ideas from the earlier era have become coreto the field, while others still remain to be pickedup and developed.We first cover classic military and diplomaticcipher types, including complex substitution ci-phers implemented in the first electro-mechanicalencryption machines.
We look at mathematicaltools (language recognition, frequency counting,smoothing) developed to decrypt such ciphers onproto-computers.
We show algorithms and exten-sive empirical results for solving different types ofciphers, and we show the role of algorithms in re-cent decipherments of historical documents.We then look at how foreign language can beviewed as a code for English, a concept devel-oped by Alan Turing and Warren Weaver.
We de-scribe recently published work on building auto-matic translation systems from non-parallel data.We also demonstrate how some of the same algo-rithmic tools can be applied to natural languagetasks like part-of-speech tagging and word align-ment.Turning back to historical ciphers, we explore anumber of unsolved ciphers, giving results of ini-tial computer experiments on several of them.
Fi-nally, we look briefly at writing as a way to enci-pher phoneme sequences, covering ancient scriptsand modern applications.2 Outline1.
