Squibs and DiscussionsAligning Phonetic SegmentsArticulation Assessmentfor Children'sHaro ld  L. Somers*UMISTIn a recent paper published in this journal (Covington 1996), an algorithm is described whichaligns segments within a pair of words for the purpose of identifying historical cognates.
Thisalgorithm could have a further application in the field of speech therapy, and in particular inthe practice of articulation assessment of young children.
The present author developed a similaralgorithm some years ago for this purpose.
In this paper, we explore some points of comparisonbetween the two applications.1.
Articulation TestingIt is well known that a child's acquisition of phonology is gradual, and can be chartedaccording to the appearance of phonetic distinctions (e.g., stops vs. fricatives), thedisappearance of childish mispronunciations, e pecially due to assimilation (\[9o9\] fordog), and the ability to articulate particular phonetic onfigurations (e.g., consonantclusters).
Childhood speech impediments, often a symptom of other learning disor-ders, can often be diagnosed early on by the identification of delayed acquisition ofthese articulatory skills.
Whether screening whole populations of children, or assessingindividual referrals, the articulation test is an important tool for the speech clinician.A child's articulatory development is usually described with reference to an adultmodel, and in terms of deviations from it: a number of phonological "processes"(Table 1) can be identified (see Ingrain \[1976\]), and their significance with respectto the chronological age of the child assessed (though often processes interact, sofor example when spoon is pronounced \[fun\] we have consonant-cluster r ductionand assimilation).
In Somers (1978a, 1979) I reported a computer program called CAT(Computerised Articulation Test), which I had developed to automate the assessmentof children's articulation tests.
At the heart of this program was an algorithm verysimilar to the one reported by Covington.Whereas Covington seeks to align the segments in possible historical cognates,CAT aligns the segments of a child's articulation with those of the adult model, and onthe basis of this looks for evidence of the phonological processes listed in Table 1.
Forexample, if elephant \[ehfAnt\] is pronounced \[evot\], we need to decide which of severalpossible alignments i the most plausible (cf.

Use of the Computer by Speech CliniciansEarly studies reporting the use of computers by speech pathologists include Faircloth(1971), van Demark and Tharp (1973), and Telage (1980), none of which involves au-tomatic analysis of the input, though the last named uses binary articulatory featuresin a way almost identical to CAT.
Comparatively ittle has appeared in the speech-language disorders literature on the specific topic of computerized articulation testingin the nearly 20 years since the CAT program was developed.
Software for computer-ized language analysis does exist, but is mainly for grammatical nd lexical analysis.Fairly thorough overviews are given by Rushakoff (1984), Rushakoff and Schwartz(1986), Long (1991), Long and Masterson (1993), and Miller and Klee (1995), thoughof course these may be more or less out of date.
Other very general works such asSchwartz (1984), Curtis (1987), Silverman (1987), Cochran and Masterson (1995), andMasterson (1995) cover the use of computers by clinicians for all aspects of their work,including screening and diagnosis of various language skills (lexis, grammar, under-standing, and auditory skills, as well as articulation) but also research (use of statistics),treatment (computer-based games), and clerical uses.
1Those programs reported in the literature which specifically address the problemof articulation testing are listed below.
For many of these programs, it seems thatthe only published information is in the user manual that accompanies the software.As far as one can tell, in none of the packages is the data analysis fully automatic.The following packages have been reviewed or discussed in the articles as cited: CAPP(Computer Analysis of Phonological Processes) (Long 1991; Kennedy 1986); ComputerManaged Articulation Diagnosis (Bardzik 1986; Long 1991); Computerized Profiling1.0 (Klee and Sahlie 1994); Computerized Profiling 2.0 (Gregg and Andrews 1995); ISPA1 Several papers refer to articles in the Journal for Computer Users in Speech and Hearing, but at the time ofwriting I was unfortunately unable to locate any copies of this obviously relevant journal.268Somers Aligning Phonetic Segments(Interactive System for Phonological Analysis) (Ball 1994); Lingquest 2 (Long 1991); PAL(Pye Analysis of Language) (Pye and Ingram 1988; Leonard 1989); PDAC (PhonologicalDeviation Analysis by Computer) (Perry 1995); PEPPER (Programs to Examine Phoneticand Phonological Evaluation Records) (Dyson 1987; Pollock 1988); Process Analysis 2.0(Long 1991).The best-known computer application in speech-language pathology research isthe CHILDES database of language samples and associated software (MacWhinney andSnow 1985; MacWhinney 1992; Sokolov and Snow 1994).
This is primarily aimed at fa-cilitating the storage and search of large databases of transcribed clinical data, wherethe transcription is basically orthographic, with mark-up for gestures, pauses, andother conversational features.
Provision is made for a phonetic transcription too, us-ing a "translation" of the IPA (International Phonetic Association) alphabet into ASCIIsymbols called "UNIBET" (MacWhinney 1992, 61ff).
Although the organizers of theCHILDES database have had input from computational linguists on the question ofmark-up, there is little or no automatic analysis.
Crucially, no attempt is made to com-pare on a phone-by-phone basis the child language data with adult models, so dataon the types of phonological process listed in Table 1 cannot be extracted.This situation is typical of child language software, exemplified by Pye and Ingram(1988), whose PAL system uses a simple transcription, based on the IPA consonant chart,without he possibility of diacritics or special symbols to indicate specifically childisharticulations.
The system is unable to compare adult models with the child's output,and can only produce a "phonological lexicon", i.e., a list of the different soundsattested: it is then up to the clinician to analyze this inventory, e.g., to see if soundsare used contrastively, or in complementary distribution.
The authors suggest hatmatching the child's utterances to an adult model would involve a procedure which"would have to be very sophisticated indeed to handle complex cases of metathesisand deletion" (p. 124).
As we show in Somers (1979) and in the next section, CAT wasable to handle metathesis and deletion without being "very sophisticated indeed."3.
The CAT AlgorithmSince the Somers (1979) article was aimed at speech therapists, it did not describethe alignment algorithm as such, which is described only in a local journal (Somers1978a) and--in great detail--in an M.A.
thesis (Somers 1978b).
It bears comparisonwith Covington's algorithm, though it should be said that the implementation in Pascalwould be judged crude in the light of modem programming practice.3.1 Coding the InputThe articulation data is coded as a narrow transcription, identifying phonetic detailsuch as secondary articulations, which can be important in speech therapy, in a fairlytransparent otation, despite the limitations of the (capitals only) character set: pri-mary phones are identified by single characters, with diacritics indicated in brackets,for example N (D) would indicate a dental (rather than alveolar) \[n\].
The notation isinterpreted internally as bundles of articulatory features.
The adult models are storedin a similar form.
In each word, one vowel is marked as the primary stress, andthis is taken as an anchor point for the alignment.
The program as a whole ignoresvowel quality, and in the CAT transcription any one of five vowel symbols (the vowelcharacters AEIOU in fact) can be used, the choice of one or the other being merely cos-metic.
This treatment of vowels is a reasonable expedient.
Primarily, CAT is aimed atconsonant articulation, which is also the main concern of speech clinicians: see Stoel-Gammon and Herrington (1990) who state that "vowels are mastered earlier \[than269Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 2TARGET RESPONSE F /L  LAB DEN ALV RET  PAL  VEL  UVU GLT  STP  FRC LAT  NAS VWLS OMITTEDT D / - /  - + .

Regarding the identificationof a single stressed vowel as an anchor point for the alignment, stress patterning (atleast in stress-timed languages like English) is one of the first features of phonologyto be acquired by children: again, if this is still a problem, then the distinctions testedby CAT will certainly be too fine-grained for such a subject.
23.2 AlignmentThe alignment is based on taking the highest-scoring matches in terms of features,much as suggested by Covington (p. 490), so that in the elephant example above, thealignment \[v\]:\[f\] is preferred over the alignment \[v\]:\[1\].
Since the number of featuresfor each segment remains constant, it is a simple matter of adding up the number ofcommon features (+ or -), and taking the highest total.
The algorithm works on thebasis of "syllables" centred around a vowel.
With the stressed vowel as an anchorpoint, the search-space is reduced to a comparison of the syllables either side of it:note that "vowel" is also marked as a feature.
This is generally straightforward if thewords are mono- or disyllabic, or trisyllabic with the stress on the second syllable.
Inother cases, if there is gross distortion of the consonants as well as inserted or omittedsyllables, alignment can become somewhat arbitrary.The algorithm takes some other factors into account, and is "tuned" to look outfor certain processes that undermine the simplistic sequential skip-and-match search(which is also the basis of Covington's algorithm): two such processes are metathesis(e.g., remember:\[mIr~mb~\]) and merging.
In merging, a consonant cluster is simplifiedso that the resulting phone shares features of the two merged phones, e.g., box \[boks\]pronounced \[bot\], where the It\] has the place of articulation of the \[s\], but the mannerof articulation of the \[k\].
Identifying metathesis can be rendered more complex by thecoincidence of some other process, e.g., stopping, so that elephant becomes \[cpIlont\]with the \[1\] and \[f\] swopped round, and the \[f\] replaced by a \[p\].
The CAT alignmentalgorithm looks for these explicitly.
Figure 1 shows the result of the alignment ofstamps:\[daoxs\], as it was actually presented.The algorithm first aligns the marked vowel.
It then takes the sequence of seg-ments either side of the vowel.
For \[st\]:\[d\], \[d\] is aligned with \[t\] rather than \[s\] as\[t\]:\[d\] represents a difference of only one feature, while \[s\]:\[d\] iffers in three fea-tures.
The evidence for a merge is the same as for the simpler devoicing analysis,2 I am grateful to the anonymous reviewer who queried this aspect of the algorithm.270Somers Aligning Phonetic Segmentsso the latter is preferred.
In the case of \[mps\]:\[~x\], the algorithm compares the fourpossibilities \[m\]:\[~\], \[p\]:\[~\], \[p\]:\[x\], and \[s\]:\[x\], as well as the possible merges \[mp\]:\[~\]and \[ps\]:\[x\], in that order.
It does not consider the matches \[m\]:\[x\] or \[s\]:\[~\] as thesewould involve a simultaneous insertion and deletion (cf.
Covington's "no-alternating-skips rule," p. 482).
As usual, the solution with the least "cost" in terms of featuredifferences i  chosen.
If the sequence includes a "no cost" match, this would imme-diately be preferred.
The test for metathesis would also be made when there is an"unstressed" vowel in the sequence, though not in consonant clusters (so vest:\[vcts\]would be analyzed incorrectly).3.3 Comparing CAT and Covington's AlgorithmComparing the CAT algorithm with Covington's, it seems that a key difference is themanual identification of a favored segment the "stressed" vowel--  as an anchorpoint.
This can drastically reduce the search-space, specially if it happens to occurnear the middle of the string, as in the above example.
Apart from this, both algorithmswork on a sequential match-or-skip, comparing the relative cost of each match, andnarrowing the search-space by halting the search if a perfect match is found.
The CATalgorithm has the additional task of searching explicitly under certain circumstancesfor metathesis and merges.Apart from Covington's more sophisticated programming style, the only otherdifference between our techniques is in the scoring method.
Covington's (p. 487)seems impler than my own, in that the penalties reflect different ypes of (mis-)match,whereas in CAT the score derives more directly from the phonetic nature of the match.Covington states, on the same page, that "excessively narrow phonetic transcriptionsdo not help; they introduce too many subtle mismatches that should have been ig-nored."
The CAT alignment algorithm, however, makes quite the opposite assumption,since the nature of the task demands a particularly narrow transcription.
Covingtonalso states (p. 490) that his algorithm could be improved by using phonetic features.It is enlightening to take Covington's cognate alignment examples and to see whatCAT would make of them.
Looking first at the Spanish-French pairs (pp.
488f), we findthat CAT agrees with Covington in 16 of the 20 cases.
CAT has problems in three caseswhere the French has lost syllables that are stressed in Spanish, as in cabdza:cap (1); 3in the case of drboharbre (2), CAT gets the correct alignment as identified by Covington(p. 488) if we omit the schwa in the French transcription (as would be normal forParisian French (Armstrong 1967, 117).Example1(1) k a b e 0 a k a b 6 0 ak ap-  - - k -  - &p-(2) a r b - o 1 6 r b - o 1a rbro -  6Rb- -RFor the English-German data (pp.
490f) CAT gets exactly the same alignments asCovington for all 20 pairs (including the incorrect analysis of this:dieses), though in CATwe would not transcribe the second element of the diphthongs in four of the examples.Like Covington's algorithm, CAT would correctly assign the \[0\] of mouth with the \[t\]rather than the \[n\] of Mund.3 In this and subsequent examples, the CAT alignments (on the fight) are shown in IPA; an acute accentmarks the "stressed" vowel.
Covington's alignments are shown on the left.271Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 2The examples considered so far have been quite straightforward (and much easierto align than typical child language data).
The English-Latin cognates (pp.
492f) presentmore of a challenge.
Applying the accepted rules of Latin stress, the CAT and Cov-ington alignments differ in five of the 20 cases: In four of these, blow'.fl~re, fish:piscis,full:pl~nus, and tooth:dentis (3), CAT does better than Covington, and in three othercases (grass:gr~men, heart:cordis, and mountain:mSns), CAT gets as first choice the align-ment Covington ranks third, second, and second respectively.
With just one exception(knee:genF~), CAT does as well as or better than Covington.Example2(3) - - -  t uwO t ~-  - - 0d e n t i - s  d ~ n t i sOn the Fox-Menomini data (p. 494), CAT gets the same results as Covington onall ten examples if we assume ither the first or the second vowel is stressed.
Finally,Covington presents a variety of language-pair examples (p. 495).
Again, the correctplacement of the stressed vowel is important, leading to a wrong alignment for cen-tum:hekaton (4), and preventing the \[0\]:\[x\] alignment in thugat~r:Tochter (5).
CAT doesworse than Covington in one other case did~rni:d8 (6), but better in three cases daugh-ter:thugat~r (7), ager:ajras (8), and bhar~mi:pher~ (9).
For centum:satem they both get thesame alignment.Example3(4) - -kentum - -k - -4ntumheka- t  on  hekat  6n- - -(5) thug  a t ~ r thug  ~ - t e rt o x - t o r  t - - 6 x t e r(6) d i d 8 m i d i d 6 m i- - d S - -  d - - 6 - -(7) - - d o t o r d - - 6 t a rthug  a t ~ r thug  6 t e r(8) a - g e r 6 g e r - -a J  r as  6d3-  r asIn summary then, CAT does worse on the Spanish-French, better on the English-Latin, and about he same on the rest.
Considering that Covington's algorithm is aimedat dealing with this sort of data, this is a good result for CAT.In a reciprocal comparison, Michael Covington was kind enough to run his algo-rithm on some child language data that I sent him.
Of 25 examples, all of which CAThandles correctly, Covington's algorithm also got the correct alignment, but often itwas unable to distinguish between alternative alignments, all of which received thesame score.
For example, with the stamps:\[da~xs\] alignment mentioned above, all sixdifferent combinations of consonant alignment either side of the vowel are proposedwith an equal score.
This is because, as Covington (personal communication) readilypoints out, "it doesn't know anything about place of articulation.
"272Somers Aligning Phonetic Segments4.
Conclus ions4.1 Connol ly 's  New Algor i thmSince the appearance of Covington's article (and even since the first draft of this reply),a highly relevant article has appeared, which--coincidentally--addresses th  issuesraised here (Connolly 1997).
In this two-part article, Connolly first suggests ways ofquantifying the difference between two individual phones, on the basis of perceptualand arficulatory differences, and using either a Euclidean distance metric or, like CAT,a feature-based metric.
Connolly's proposals are more elaborate, however, in that theypermit specific differences to be weighted, so as to reflect the relative importanceof each opposition.
In the second part of the article, Connolly introduces a distancemeasure for comparing sequences of phones, based on the Levenshtein distance well-known in the speech processing and corpus alignment literature (inter alia).
Again, thismetric can be weighted, to allow substitutions to be valued differentially (presumablyon the basis of the individual phone distance measure as described in the first part),and to deal with merging and metathesis.
Connolly also considers briefly the effectsof nonlinear prosodic structure on the distance measure.
Although his methods areclearly computational in nature, Connolly reported (personal communication, 1997)that he had not yet implemented them.
Taken together, these measures are certainlymore sophisticated than either CAT's or Covington's, so this contribution could well bean extremely significant one towards the development of articulation testing software.In Somers (1998), I report an implementation and comparison of Connolly's measureswith my own earlier work.4.2 What Would a New Version of CAT Be Like?In the light of the above remarks, it is interesting to think about how we might specifya reimplementation f CAT.
One area where there could be considerable improvementis in the data input.
CAT uses a very crude phonetic transcription based only on aminimal character set, not even including lower-case letters.
Clearly this restrictionwould not be necessary nowadays.
The software system PDAC (Phonological Devia-tion Analysis by Computer) uses a software package called LIPP (Logical Internationalphonetic Programs) for input of transcriptions (Perry 1995).
Alternatively, it seemsquite feasible to allow the transcriptions to be input using a standard word processorand a phonetic font, and to interpret he symbols accordingly.
For a commercial im-plementation it would be better to follow the standard proposed by the IPA (Eslingand Gaylord 1993), which has been approved by the ISO, and included in the Unicodedefinitions.Despite the reservations of all the speech-language pathology experts, it seemsto me that the work on alignment discussed here (Somers 1978b; Covington 1996;Connolly 1997) suggests that this aspect of computerized articulation test analysis is aresearch aim well worth pursuing, especially if collaborators from the speech-languagepathology field can be found.
It would be rewarding if this article were to awakeninterest in the problem.AcknowledgmentsI would like to thank the following peoplefor their help in gathering the informationpresented in this paper: Catherine Adams(University of Manchester), LawrenceShriberg (University of Wisconsin-Madison),Julie Masterson (Southwest Missouri StateUniversity), Carol Stoel-Gammon(University of Washington) and JohnConnolly (Loughborough University);Michael Covington, for collaborating on the"bake-off"; Joe Somers, for providing someof the example data; and the threeanonymous reviewers for their suggestions,which have been extremely valuable.273Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 2ReferencesArmstrong, Lilias E. 1967.
