Thus Cn(SQ) i s  the  theoret i ca lse t  of  s ta tements  re levant  fo r  the bu i ld -up  of  the  answer.Such a set  of  consequences would grow beyond any l im i ts ,  sothat  i t  i s  necessary  to fo rmula te  a s t ra tegy  which cont ro l sthe whole process .

Labels  are  used fo rrepresent ing  e lementary  terms of  knowledge (meaning) ,  whi lep ro~ect iv i ty  permits  a t reatment  of  the  contextua l  ro le  ofthe words in  the  sentence .
For l ingu is t i ca l l y  mot ivated  ru les ,which are emphasized in  our paper ,  we can use a bottom-ups t ra tegy  car r ied  out here by us ing  Colmerauer?s  Q-systems.Such a s t ra tegy  i s  not  fu l l y  sa t i s fac tory  fo r  an in fe renceprocess  cont ro l led  by log ica l  pat te rns .

( i i )  The procedure of  the  search  fo r  an answer to thequest ion  Q operates  in  the set  Cn(SQ).
A consequence cECn(SQ)must fu l f i l  the fo l low ing  cond i t ions  to be chosen as a ( fu l lor  par t ia l )  answer to Q:(a) the root  of  c must be e i ther  ident i ca l  w i th  theroot  of  Q ( ident i ty  means co inc idence  in  a l l  par ts  of  thecomplex labe l  of  the node, where "co inc idence"  i s  de f ined  asa l low ing  fo r  cer ta in  spec i f i c  d i f fe rences  such as that  ofs ingu lar  vs .

,  o r ,  i f  the lex ica lpart  of  the labe l  of the  root  of  Q equals  "d~lat "  (Eng l i sh  doin  the  meaning o f  a fu l l  verb) ,  then the lex ica l  par t  of thelabe l  of  the root  of  c may have any shape prov ided i t  inc ludesand index  denot ing  the feature  "Act iv i ty"  !
(b) c must comprise a path that  i s  ident i ca l  w i th  thepath in  Q that  leads  to the node labe l led  by the representat -i on  of  the quest ion  word (WH), except that  the lex ica l  par tof  the labe l  of  the counterpar t  of WH in  c cons is ts  in  a con-c re te  lex ica l  word, poss ib ly  accompanied by words dependent oni t .- 140  -(c)  ?
