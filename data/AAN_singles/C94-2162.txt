corn.AbstractThis paper describes how recent linguistic results inexplaining Japanese short and long distance scramhling (:an be directly incorporated into an exist-ing principles-and-parameters-based p rser with onlytriviM modifications. '
\['he fact that this is realizableon a parser originally designed for a fixed-word-orderlanguage, together with the fact thai; Japanese scram-bling is complex, attests to the high degree of crosslinguistic generalization present in the theory.1 In t roduct ionl)uring the past several years, the phenomenon k ownas "sermnbling" has become a topic of some interest;it is of particular importance in languages like Get'-man, Japanese, Korean and tlindi among others, itsopposed to fixed-word-order languages like English.Scrambling can pose both sever(', linguistic and cornpu-rational ditficulties for naturM language parsers.
Thispaper describes how these problems are dealt with ina Principles-and-I)aran3eters-based p rser.

)To handle examples like these, computational lin-guists have sometimes adopted the straightforwardstrategy of adding permutation machinery on top of anexisting formMism: for example, Becket el; M.(1990)augment he '\[?ee Adjoining Grammar (TAG) sys-tent using either: (1) multi-component (set-based)adjunct!on (Me-TAG), or (9) relaxed linear prece-dence (FO-TAG), I~o handle so-called "long distance"scrambling in German (that is, scrambling over clausalboundaries).
2 This augmentation aims to directly re-pair the lack off pernmtation in ordinary TAGs byadding a mechanism that can (over)generate manydifferent scramblings, llowever, as so often hap-pens, when one turns to a richer sel; of exmnples inother languages, or the interaction of scrambling withother phenomena such as anaphor binding and weakcrossover, things are not as simple as they appear andthe straightforward solution breaks clown.An altogether different appro~ch is t~ken in this paper.
The goM is to produce an a nMysis of scram-bling that works for different languages and a widervariety of examples wilhou!
introducing new machin-ery.
The essential idea is to rely on the same (uni-versal) constraints and parsing algorithms Mready inplace for non-scramhling languages, e.g.
English.
\[nother words, we adopt the null hypothesis.
So, we be-gin with a comImtationally-rnodelh:d linguistic frame-work that is already capable of handling scrambling asthe dedm-tive result of interactions ofbasic principles,such as general movement (Move-c 0 with Binding the-ory.
The point is that scrambling (like the so-calledi asmv ; and "dative" constructions) obeys the samei:estrictions ah'eady showu to be operative for othersyntactic phenomena, and so shoukl follow from in-1 (Salt, o, 1992) remarks  that  ko to %he fact.

All ex-amples are taken From (Saito, 1985) and have beenverified to work on the parser unless otherwise stated.

(4a) is strMghtforwardlyruled out by Condition C of the Binding theory since5As is conventional, sul)scrlpt indices will be used tomark coreference possibilities.
Roughly speaking, if two NPshave identical indices, then are said to denot, e the sameobject/person.kate binds John.
(4c) and (4d) flora (Saito, 1992)are also handled by Binding theory.
In (4c) olagaiis unbound which violates Condition A (all anaphorshave to be A-bound).
In (4d) it is A-bound since wehave assumed scrambling to A-positions.
Ilence, thesedata.
involving tile scrambling of anaphors and pro-nouns constitutes evidence that scrambled elementsobey the usual principh;s.2.3 Scrambling and Weak CrossoverWeak Crossover (WCO) effects are a well-known phe-nomenon in English.
For example:(5)  (a)  Whoi  loves his i n\ ]other(b)* Who/ does hisi mother love ti(5a) can be interpreted as asking tile question forwhich.
person a:, x loves x 's  mother.
Crucially, (51))cannot be interpreted as asking the question: for'which, person x, x 's  ?no/her loves x.
In the parser, theunavailability of (Sb) is explained by an LF principle,Ileanalyze Pro-l;'orms, which reanMyzes as variablesthose pro-rorms (e.g.
pronouns) hound by an operatorin tm A-position, as suggested by the above logicalanalysis.
\[iowever, this fails when the pro-fbrm inter-venes between the operator mid its trace, as is the casein (Sh).

Adoptingthis definition immediately eliminates cases (a) (c),and more importantly, the repeated application of case(a) which causes parsing non-termination, la In par-titular, this rules out vacnons scrambling over emptysubjects, e.g.
pro or PRO.
As far the data from (Saito,1985),(1992) and ('I'ada, 1993) goes, this is no restric-tion at all.
This leaves case (d) which is vacuous onlywhen considered as a "pair", i.e.
each sub-instance isclearly non-vacuous.We will make use of the following assumptions:1.
Scrambling is always to the left.2.
Empty NPs don't scramble.Again, judging from the data, these appear to be norestriction all.
Now, it, is simple to implement henon-vacuity (NV) constraint as a licensing conditionon phrasal adjunction:IPi --+ sNP, IPi(x), {NV(x)}VP; ~sNP,  VPi(x), {NV(z)}ltere, we assume that there are two phrasM adjnnc-tion rules, for IP attd VP, that introduce scrambledNPs (sNPs).
14 Here, {NV(x)} is a semantic aelionwhich checks the frontier of x, the tP or VP phrase,for non-vacuity using the following left-to-right, twostate machine:State 0: (Start) See an overt node, go to State 1.State 1: (End) Skip until see an NP gap, halt.Note this is potentially inefficient since the NV con-straint is only checked when the LtUmachine com-pletes the RHS of a rule, i.e.
when it completes an IPor VP phrase.
By operating at the lew~l of the terminalstring, instead of waiting for the complete IP or VP,laNote that the string w'tcuous empty operator movementshowIl in (C) do(Is not count as an instance of scrambling.
It'snot adjunction at VP or \[P.14The tricky case of (d) shown earlier can be handled hy re-stricting sNP to overt NPs only.we (:an take advantage of the fact; that scrambling isalways to tile left to implement the non-vacuity checkin ~ strictly left-to-right fashion.
As before, when wesee a potentially scrambled NP, we start the two statemachine.
Ilere, the basic idea is that a shift action(read a terminM) corresponds to the state 0 to state1 transition.
Similarly, a NP-~ ,~ reduce action corre-sponds to the "see an NP gap and halt" part.
Con,-paring the two algorithms on 50 Japanese sentences(25 scrambling examples) fi'om (Saito, 1985) & (Las-nik & Saito, 1984), an average speed-up factor of 2.3per sentence and a total of 3.2 over the 50 sentenceswas observed for the second algorithm over just thephrase structure recovery portion.
Due to the varyingeffects from the participation of other principh'.s, theimprovement for the total parsing time was le.ss clear-cut, generally varying between o speed-up at all l;o afactor of two depending on the sentence.
Using the 25non-scrambling examples fl'om the test set, an addi-tional experiment hetween two variants of the parser,one with and one without the ability to handle scrambling, showed that the ability to handle scrambling ex-acts a penalty of about 30 50% in total parsing time,In conclusion, given tit(; pertlaps disproportionate el'-feet of scrambling on parsing time, we suggest thatalthough scrambling comes virtually for free linguisti-cally speaking, the same certainly does not N)pear tobe the case for computation.References2'.
