On Semantics of Some Verbal Categories in EnglishEva HaJi6ov~, PragueAn attempt is made at such a description of thesemantics of some verbal categories that would fit in thefunctional type of generative description of language asproposed by Sgall.
In most analyses of the.
relationshipbetween the morphemic verbal forms and their temporal mean-ings that have been made in this sphere up to now, theschemas employed proceed in two directions, that of temp-oral specification (Past - Present - Future) and temporalrelationship (Anterior - Simultaneous - Posterior), cf.forinstance survey of these approaches given by R.L.AIIen,The Verb System of Present-Day American English, The Haag,1966.
Our investigation of the meanings the verbal formsconvey has led us, however, to the recognition of st leasttwo other categories at the level of the semantic structureof the sentence besides those mentioned above and besidesthe additional indication in some forms concerning the timeextension of the event (Immediate - Extended), namely thatof Inclusiveness (Inclusive - Noninclusive) and Aspect (Re-sultetive - Completed - Processual).The status of these categories will be discussed andillustrated on English examples, as we~l as some remarkswill be added concerning the possible application of ourinvestigations (when confronted with Czech) in the work onthe problems of machine translation.
