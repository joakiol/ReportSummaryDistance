It is semantics thatwe concentrate upon in this paper.Many attempts have been made to use tra-ditional dictionaries in order to assign wordsenses to general semantic ategories, cf.
\[1\].Our LDB contains emantic information thatcannot be elicited from the existing dictionar-ies.
The priority is given to semantic fea-tures influencing lexieal or grammatical co-occurrence.
In this paper possibilities arediscussed of predicting selection~l restrictions,syntactic features and other formal character-istics of the utterance - such as the array of ar-guments and their semantic interpretation, themeaning of an aspeetual form of a verb etc., -on the basis of semantic features of a word inthe lexicon.The main advantage of a lexicai database ascompared with a traditional dictionary consistsin the fact that a database makes it possible topresent semantic information in a format en-abling the computer to locate efficiently vari-ous types of information specified for a givenclass of words.
To put it differently, the mainadvantage of a database consists in the possi-bility of compiling lists of words possessing acommon feature or a set of features.There are three main principles that the sys-tem is based upon.1.
We are convinced that semantic featuresof words determine co-occurence to a muchgreater extent han it is usually acknowledged.In other words, we claim that many aspects ofsyntactic subcategorization f lexical items arepredictable from their meaning.2.
A semantic feature of a word is essentiallya semantic omponent (or components) in itslexieographic definition.3.
A great amount of information about themeaning of a lexical unit; about its combina-tory possibilities; prosody; referential features;or about its regular ambiguity, need not hestored in the dictionary: this information be-longs to wi~at may be called a grammar  oflexicon and should be formulated in a gen-eralized form.
In this form it can be storedin a Lexical Knowledge-Base of semanticand syntactic regularities.
This Knowledge-Base has not yet been designed, but semanticfeatures of words in LDB are conceived as aninput for general rules that will be stored inthis hypothetical Knowledge-Base.2 Lex ica l  Database  for Con-c re te  NounsThere are different layers of lexicon that requirespecific formats of a database, and the choiceof the format is one of the main problems ofdatabase formation.In what follows we list domains in the LexicalDatabase for Concrete Nouns - one of the com-ponents of Lexicographer, now implemented ina working program~ Each domain is interpretedas a feature that can take a definite set of val-ues.Domain I.

\])eclension and accentuation.All the other domains contain semantic information.
We do not mean that the system ofsemantic features wouhl provide a word withan exhaustive texicographic delinition - this isnot the appropriate task for a lexical database.Tire purpose of a database is to highlight hosesemantic aspects of a word that unite semantieally cognate words and differentiate many ofsemantically different words from one another.In othe.r words, lexical database is an instru-ment of predicting and calculating all sorts ofusefifl semantic lasses of words.Domains ILl and II.2 specify MereologieMstatus of a word (more precisely, of a lexeme- namely, of a word taken in one of its lexi-cal meanings).
The wdues of the feature I1.1may be: PART, SET or WII()LE.
In the latercase dommn 11.2 is emtrty while in the tlrst twocases it specifies the WIIOLE for the PARTand the ELEMENT for the SI';T: I'ART (SI';T)of what?
E.g.,(1) krylo 'all'M-status I PARTOf what { body(2) stado 'herd'M-status I SF/I'Of what \]animals(3) ehelovek 'man'M-status I WflOI,EOf what I -I)omain 1\[.3 provides a lexeme with a tax-onumic supercategory, such as Person, Plant,Animal, Metal, Building, Sphere of activity etc.Tiffs domain is of primary importance arrd it istlds domain that defines the most interestingclasses of concrete \]exenle8.
The systenl of tax-onomic categories h~ a hierarchical structure.Thus, the possibility is provided to state imoplieative (lelmndencies between categories, sothat the lower category inherits all the informa-tion from the category of a higher \[rwel.
E.g.,T.
eategol'y (osobnjak 'private residence') =dora 'h<)use';T-category (dora) - postrojka 'building';T-category (postrojka) sooruzenie 'con-struction'.Thus, lexeme osobnjak will be assigned notonly to the class of houses but ~dso to the classof lmildings and to the class of constructions.Domain II.4 specifies a Predicate semanti-cally connected with the noun in question.
Itturns out that such predicates occupy the nr()stprominent place in lexicographic definitions ofa great majority of concrete nouns.
Usuallythese are predicates that determine a standardway in which the corresponding object is usedACRES DE COLING-92, NAN'rE.S, 23-28 ^ ot;r 1992 1 2 9 7 PROC.

There arealso nouns that imply a non-functional predi-cate in ttteir lexicographic definition - a predi-cate that determines its characteristic property,cf.Predicate (liquide) = to flow.Some nouns require predicates of both types,cf.Predicate (cellar) =1) to store products;2) digged under the floor of a house.For some classes of nouns Domain 1.4 Predi-cate is empty, e.g., for some (not all!)

As was stated earlier, domainsII.1, II.2 define the following relations:1) PART-WHOLE;2) SET-ELEMENT.There are propositions that differentiatethese two relations; thus, combinations in (a),with PART-WHOLE relation are possible witha preposition U, while combinations in (b),with a SET-ELEMENT relation, are not:a. nozka 'leg' U stula 'chair'pugovica 'button'  U paljto ~coat'b.
