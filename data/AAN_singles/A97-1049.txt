An Intelligent Multilingual Information Browsing and RetrievalSystem Using Information ExtractionChinatsu  Aone  and N icho las  Charocopos  and James  Gor l inskySystems Research and Appl ications Corporat ion (SRA)4300 Fair Lakes CourtFairfax, VA 22033aonec@sra.comAbst rac tIn this paper, we describe our multilingual(or cross-linguistic) information browsingand retrieval system, which is aimed atmonolingual users who are interested in in-formation from multiple language sources.The system takes advantage of informationextraction (IE) technology in novel waysto improve the accuracy of  cross-linguisticretrieval and to provide innovative meth-ods for browsing and exploring multilin-gual document collections.
The system in-dexes texts in different languages (e.g., En-glish and Japanese) and allows the users toretrieve relevant exts in their native lan-guage (e.g., English).
The retrieved textis then presented to the users with propernames and specialized omain terms trans-lated and hyperlinked.
Moreover, the sys-tem allows interactive information discov-ery from a multilingual document collec-tion.1 In t roduct ionMore and more multilingual information is availableon-line every day.
The World Wide Web (WWW),for example, is becoming a vast depository of mul-tilingual information.
However, monolingual userscan currently access information only in their na-tive language.
For example, it is not easy for amonolingual English speaker to locate necessary in-formation written in Japanese.
The users would notknow the query terms in Japanese ven if the searchengine accepts Japanese queries.
In addition, evenwhen the users locate a possibly relevant ext inJapanese, they will have little idea about what isin the text.
Outputs of off-the-shelf machine trans-lation (MT) systems are often of low-quality, andeven "high-end" MT systems have problems partic-ularly in translating proper names and specializeddomain terms, which often contain the most criticalinformation to the users.In this paper, we describe our multilingual (orcross-linguistic) information browsing and retrievalsystem, which is aimed at monolingual users whoare interested in information from multiple languagesources.
The system takes advantage of informationextraction (IE) technology in novel ways to improvethe accuracy of cross-linguistic retrieval and to pro-vide innovative methods for browsing and exploringmultilingual document collections.
The system in-dexes texts in different languages (e.g., English andJapanese) and allows the users to retrieve relevanttexts in their native language (e.g., English).
Theretrieved text is then presented to the users withproper names and specialized omain terms trans-lated and hyperlinked.
The system also allows theuser in their native language to browse and discoverinformation buried in the database derived from theentire document collection.2 Sys tem Descr ip t ionThe system consists of the Indexing Module, theClient Module, the Term Translation Module, andthe Web Crawler.
The Indexing Module creates andloads indices into a database while the Client Moduleallows browsing and retrieval of information in thedatabase through a Web browser-based graphicaluser interface (GUI).
The Term Translation Mod-ule is bi-directional; it dynamically translates userqueries into target foreign languages and the indexedterms in retrieved ocuments into the user's nativelanguage.
The Web Crawler can be used to add tex-tual information from the WWW; it fetches pagesfrom user-specified Web sites at specified intervals,and queues them up for the Indexing Module to in-gest regularly.For our current application, the system indexesnames of people, entities, and locations, and scien-tific and technical (S~zT) terms in both English andJapanese texts, and allows the user to query andbrowse the database in English.
When Japanesetexts are retrieved, indexed terms are translated intoEnglish.This system is designed to expand to other lan-332guages besides English and Japanese and other do-mains beyond S&T terms.
Moreover, the English-centric browsing and retrieval mode can be switchedaccording to the users' language preference so that,for example, a Japanese user can query and browseEnglish documents in Japanese.2.1 The  In te l l igent  Index ing  Modu leThe Indexing Module indexes names of people, enti-ties, and locations and a list of scientific and techni-cal (S~zT) terms using state-of-the-art IE technol-ogy.
It uses different configurations of the samefast indexing engine called NameTag TM for differ-ent languages.
Two separate configurations ("index-ing servers") are used for English and Japanese, andhow the English and Japanese indexing servers workis described in (Krupka, 1995; Aone, 1996).In the Sixth Message Understanding Conference(MUC-6), the English system was benchmarkedagainst the Wall Street Journal blind test set forthe name tagging task, and achieved a 96% F-measure, which is a combination of recall and preci-sion measures (Adv, 1995),.
Our internal testingof the Japanese system against blind test sets ofvarious Japanese newspaper articles indicates thatit achieves from high-80 to low-90% accuracy, de-pending on the types of corpora.
Indexing namesin Japanese texts is usually more challenging thanEnglish for two main reasons.
First, there is no casedistinction in Japanese, whereas English names innewspapers are capitalized, and capitalization is avery strong clue for English name tagging.
Sec-ond, Japanese words are not separated by spaces andtherefore must be segmented into separate words be-fore the name tagging process.
As segmentation isnot 100% accurate, segmentation errors can some-times cause name tagging rules not to fire or to mis-fire.Indexing of names is particularly useful in theJapanese case as it can improve overall segmenta-tion and thus indexing accuracy.
In English, sincewords are separated by spaces, there is no issue of in-dexing accuracy for individual words.
On the otherhand, in languages like Japanese, where word bound-aries are not explicitly marked by spaces, indexingaccuracy of individual words depends on accuracyof word segmentation.
However, most segmentationalgorithms are more likely to make errors on names,as these are less likely to be in the lexicons.
Nametagging can reduce such errors by identifying namesas single units.Both indexing servers are "intelligent" becausethey identify and disambiguate names with highspeed and accuracy.
They identify names in textsdynamically rather than relying on finite lists ofnames.
Thus, they can identify names which theyhave never seen before.
In addition, they can dis-ambiguate types of names so that a person named"Washington" is distinguished from a place calledWashington, and a company "Apple" can be dis-tinguished from a common noun "apple."
In addi-tion, they can generate aliases of names automat-ically (e.g., "ANA" for "All Nippon Airline") andlink variants of names within a document.As the indexing servers process texts, the in-dexed terms are stored in a relational databasewith their semantic type information (person, entity,place, S&:T term) and alias information along withsuch meta data as source, date, language, and fre-quency information.
The system can use any ODBC(Open DataBase Connectivity)-compliant database,and form-based Boolean queries from the ClientModule, similar to those seen in any Web searchengine, are translated into standard SQL queriesautomatically.
We have decided to use commercialdatabases for our applications as we are not only in-dexing strings of terms but also adding much richerinformation on indexed terms available through theuse of IE technology.
Furthermore, we plan to applydata-mining algorithms to the resulting databasesto conduct advanced data analysis and knowledgediscovery.2.2 The  Cl ient  Modu leThe Client Module lets the user both retrieve andbrowse information in the database through the Webbrowser-based GUI.
In the query mode (cf.
Fig-ure 1), a form-based Boolean query issued by a useris automatically translated into an SQL query, andthe English terms in the query are sent to the TermTranslation Module.
The Client Module then re-trieves documents which match either the originalEnglish query or the translated Japanese query.
Asthe indices are names and terms which may con-sist of multiple words (e.g, "Bill Clinton," "personalcomputer"), the query terms are delimited in sep-arate boxes in the form, making sure no ambiguityoccurs in both translation and retrieval.
The userhas the choice of selecting the sources (e.g, Washing-ton Post, Nikkei Newspaper, Web pages), languages(e.g., English, Japanese, or both), and specific dateranges of documents to constrain queries.In the browsing mode, the Client Module allowsthe user to browse the information in the databasein various ways.
As an overview of the database con-tent, the Client Module lets the user browse the top25 and 50 most frequent entity, person, and loca-tion names and S&T terms in the database (cf.
Fig-ure 4).
Once the user selects a particular documentfor viewing, the client sends the document o an ap-propriate (i.e., English or Japanese) indexing serverfor creating hyperlinks for the indexed terms and inthe case of a Japanese document, sends the indexedterms to the Term Translation Module to translatethe Japanese terms into English.
The result that theuser browses is a document each of whose indexedterms are hyperlinked to other documents contain-ing the same indexed terms (cf.
Figure 2).

.=,Figure 2: Translated and Hyperlinked Termsperlinking is based on the original or translated En-glish terms, the user can follow the links to both En-glish and Japanese documents transparently.
In ad-dition, the Client Module is integrated with a com-mercial MT system for rough translation.
A docu-ment which the user is browsing can be translatedon the fly by clicking the TRANSLATE button.2.3 The  Term Trans la t ion  Modu leThe Term Translation Module is used by the ClientModule bi-directionally in two different modes.
Ittranslates English query terms into Japanese in thequery mode and translates Japanese indexed termsinto English for viewing of a retrieved Japanese textin the browsing mode.This translation module is sensitive to the seman-tic types of terms it is translating to resolve trans-lation ambiguity.
Thus, if a term can be translatedin one way for one type and in another way for an-other type, the Term Translation Module can outputappropriate translations based on the type informa-tion.
For example, in translating Japanese text intoEnglish, a single kanji (Chinese) character standingfor England can be also a first name of a Japanesepersonal name, which should be translated to "Hide"and not "England."
In translating an English queryinto Japanese, a company "Apple" should be trans-lated into a transliteration i katakana nd not intoa Japanese word meaning a fruit apple.The Term Translation Module uses various re-sources and methods to translate English andJapanese names.
We use automated methods asmuch as possible to reduce the cost of creating alarge name lexicon manually.First, this module is unique in that it creates onthe fly English translations of hiragana names andpersonal names.
Hiragana names are transliteratedinto English using the hiragana-to-romaji mappingrules.
Japanese personal names are translated byfinding a combination of first and last names whichspans the input)  Then, each of the name parts istranslated using the Japanese-English first and lastname lexicons.In addition, in order to develop a large lexiconof English names and their Japanese translations,which are transliterated into katakana, we have au-tomatically generated katakana names from pho-netic transcriptions of English names.
We havewritten rules which maps phonetic transcriptions tokatakana letters, and generated possible Japanesekatakana translations for given English names.
Astransliterations of the same English names may dif-fer, multiple katakana translations may be generatedfor single English names3The remaining terms are currently translated us-ing the English-Japanese translation lexicons, andwe are expanding the lexicons by utilizing on-lineresources and corpora and a translation aiding tool.3 Utilizing IE in MultilingualI n fo rmat ion  AccessThe system applies information extraction technol-ogy (Adv, 1995) to index names accurately and ro-bustly.
In this section, we describe how we have in-corporated this technology to improve multilingualinformation access in several innovative ways.3.1 Query  D isambiguat ionAs described in Section 2.1, the Indexing Module notonly identifies names of people, entities and locationsbut also disambiguates types among themselves andbetween names and non-names.
Thus, if the user issearching for documents with the location "Wash-ington (not a person or a company named "Wash-ington"), a person "Clinton" (not a location), or anentity "Apple" (not fruit), the system allows the userto specify, through the GUI, the type of each queryterm (cf.
Figure 1).
This ability to disambiguatetypes of queries not only constrains the search andhence improves retrieval precision but also speeds1The Japanese Indexing Module does not specify ifan identified name is a first name, a last name, or acombination of first and last name.
Since there is nospace between first and last names in Japanese, this mustbe automatically determined.2This is still an experimental effort, and we have notevaluated the quality of generated translations quantita-tively yet.335up the search time considerably especially when thedatabase is very large.3.2 T rans la t ion  D isambiguat ionIn developing the system, we have intentionallyavoided an approach where we first translate foreign-language documents into English and index thetranslated English texts (Fluhr, 1995; Kay, 1995;Oard and Dorr, 1996).
In (Aone et al, 1994), wehave shown that, in an application of extracting in-formation from foreign language texts and present-ing the results in English, the "MT first, IE second"approach was less accurate than the approach in thereverse order, i.e., "IE first, MT second".
In partic-ular, translation quality of names by even the bestMT systems is poor.There are two cases where an MT system fails totranslate names.
First, it fails to recognize wherea name starts and ends in a text string.
This is anon-trivial problem in languages uch as Japanesewhere words are not segmented by spaces and thereis no capitalization convention.
Often, an MT sys-tem "chops up" names into words and translateseach word individually.
For example, among theerrors we have encountered, an MT system failedto recognize a person name "Mori Hanae" in kanjicharacters, segmented it into three words "mori,""hana," and "e" and translated them into "forest,""England" and "blessing," respectively.Another common MT system error is where thesystem fails to make a distinction between namesand non-names.
This distinction is very importantin getting correct translations as names are usu-ally translated very differently from non-names.
Forexample, a personal name "Dole" in katakana wastranslated into a common noun "doll" as the twohave the same katakana string in Japanese.
Abbre-viated country names for Japan and United States insingle kanji characters, which often occurs in news-papers, were sometimes translated by an MT systeminto their literal kanji meanings, "day" and "rice,"respectively.Our system avoids these common but serioustranslation errors by taking advantage of the Index-ing Module's ability to identify and disambiguatenames.
In translating terms from Japanese to En-glish in the browsing mode, the Indexing Moduleidentifies names correctly, avoiding the first typeof translation errors.
Then, the Term TranslationModule utilizes type information obtained by the In-dexing Module to decide which translation strategiesto use, thus overcoming the second type of error.3.3 Intelligent Query Expansion andHyperlinkingAs described in Section 2.1, the Indexing Moduleautomatically identifies aliases of names and keepstrack of such alias links in the database.
For exam-ple, if "International Business Machine" and "IBM"appears in the same document, the system recordsin the database that they are aliases.The system uses this information in automaticallyexpanding terms for query expansion and hyper-linking.
At the query time, when the user types"IBM" and chooses the alias option in the searchscreen (see Figure 1), the query is automatically ex-panded to include its variant names both in Englishand Japanese, e.g., "International Business Ma-chine," "International Business Machine Corp." andJapanese translations for "IBM" and their aliasesin Japanese.
This is especially useful in retriev-ing Japanese documents because typically the userwould not know various ways to say "IBM" inJapanese.
The automated query expansion thusimproves retrieval recall without manually creatingalias lexicons.The same alias capability is also used in hyper-linking indexed terms in browsing a document.
Forexample, when a user follows a hyperlink "UnitedStates," it takes the user to a collection of documentswhich contains the English term "United States"and its aliases (e.g., "US," "U.S.A." etc.
), and theJapanese translations of "United States" and theiraliases.
The result is a truly transparent multilin-gual document browsing and access capability.3.4 In fo rmat ion  D iscoveryOne of the biggest advantages of introducing IE tech-nology into information access systems is the abilityto create rich structured ata which can be analyzedfor "buried" information.
Our multilingual capabil-ity enables the merging of possibly complementarydata from both English and Japanese sources andenriching the available information.Currently thesystem offers the user several waysto explore and discover hidden information.
Oursearch capability allows interactive information dis-covery methods.
For example, using the query inter-face, the user can in effect ask "Which company wasmentioned along with Intel in regard to micropro-cessors?"
and the system will return all the articleswhich mentions "Intel," "microprocessors," and oneor more company names.
The user might see thatNexGen and Cyrix often occurs with Intel and findout that they are competitors of Intel in this field.Or the user might ask "Who is related to "Shinshin-tou Party," a Japanese political party, and the usercan find out all the people associated with this party.This type of search capabilities cannot be offered bytypical information retrieval systems as they treatwords as just strings and do not distinguish theirsemantic attributes.Furthermore, as we discussed earlier in Sec-tion 2.2, browsing documents by following hyper-links allows a user to discover related informationeffectively.
For example, when the user searches fordocuments on "NEC Corp.", selects one of the re-turned documents, and finds another company name336: u~ *Pro  ~.=.= ~ : ~  ..,a~:t~P~t~,.... : : : " .

For example, Figure 3 shows a list ofpeople co-occurring with the place "Peru."

)4 The  System TourIn this section, we give a tour of the system.
Figure 4shows the main Browse screen where the user canbrowse the top 25 or 50 names of people, entities,locations, and S&:T terms.
This can provide theuser with a snapshot of what is in the database andwhat types of information are likely to be available.By following the top 50 entity name link, the usersees the list of entity names in order of frequency(cf.
Figure 5).
The Subtype column in the screenindicates more detailed types of the entity (e.g., or-ganization, company, facility, etc.)
From this screen,the user can go to a list of all English and Japanesedocuments which mention, for example, "Bank ofJapan" by clicking the link (cf.
Figure 6).
The listprovides information on the title, length, source, lan-guage, and date of each article.

.Figure 7: Translation by a Commercial MT systemIn the main Search screen (cf.
Figure 1), the usertypes in each query term, including multi-words like"personal computer," in each numbered box.
Theuser can formulate a Boolean query using the boxnumbers and boolean operators.
If not specified, thequery terms are joined by "OR".
When the Al iasbutton is on, query terms are expanded to includetheir aliases.
The Type  menu allows the user to dis-ambiguate types of query terms.
In the Languagebox, the user has the choice of selecting documentsin English, Japanese, or both.
In addition, the usercan constrain sources and the date range of docu-ments, and also sort the results by date, title, andsources .As discussed in Section 2.2, when the user selects aJapanese article, they can optionally send the articleto a commercial MT system for rough translation bypushing the TRANSLATE button (cf.
Figure2).
Fig-ure 7 shows the translation result for the Japanesedocument in Figure 2.5 SummaryWe have described an advanced multilingual cross-linguistic information browsing and retrieval sys-tem which takes advantage of information extractiontechnology in unique ways.
In addition to its basiccapability of allowing a user to send Boolean queriesin English against English and Japanese documentsand to view the results in semi- and fully translatedforms, the system has many innovative capabilities.It can disambiguate query terms to increase preci-sion, expand query terms automatically using aliasesto increase recall, and improve translation accuracysignificantly by finding and disambiguating namesaccurately.
Moreover, the system allows interactiveinformation discovery from a multilingual documentcollection by combining IE and MT technologies.The Indexing Module is currently running on aSun platform and is designed to scale for a multi-useroperational environment.
The Web browser-baseduser interface will work in any Web browser sup-porting HTML 3.0 on any platform which the Webbrowser supports, and this ensures a large user base.The system is customizable in several ways.
For ourcurrent application, the system indexes names andS&T terms, but for other applications we can cus-tomize the system to index different ypes of namesand terms.
For example, the system can be cus-tomized to index product names and financial termsfor a business application.
Its ODBC-compliancemakes porting of databases from one vendor to an-other very easy.
Finally, the system does not as-sume any particular language combination or targetlanguage.
Thus, this system can also be used forJapanese monolingual users who want to query andbrowse in Japanese a set of documents written inEnglish, Japanese, and Spanish.338ReferencesAdvanced Research Projects Agency.
