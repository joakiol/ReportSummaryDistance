INFERENCING ON L INGUISTICALLY BASED ZZ~IANTIC STRUCTUR~FEva Ilaji~ov~, Mi lena Hn~tkov~Department of Appl ied Mathemat icsFaculty of Mathemat ics  and PhysicsCharles Univers i ty~lalostransk4 n. 25118 O0 Praha I, CzechoslovakiaABSTRACTThe paper character izes natural lang-uage inferencing in the TIBAQ method ofquestion-answering, focussing on three asp-ects: ~i) speci f icat ion of the structureson which the inference rules operate, (ii)c lass i f icat ion of the rules that have beenformulated and implemented up to now,according to the kind of modi f icat ion ofthe input structure ti~e rules invoke, an~(iii) d iscussion of some points in whicha prover ly designed inference proceduremay help the searc~ of the answer, andvice versa.I SPECIFICATION OF THE I:~PUT STRUCTURESFOR INFE~ENC I\[IGA.
Outl ine of the TIBAQ ~lethodhhen the TIBA~ (~ext-and-~nferencebased ~nswer ing of ~uest ions)  project was~esigned, main emphasis was laid on theautomatic bui ld-up of the stock of know-ledge from the (non-~re-edited% input text.The exper imental  system based 6n this meth-od converses automat ica l ly  the naturallanguage input (both the quest ions and newFieces of information, i.e.
Czech sentencesin their usual form) into the reDresentat-ions of n,eaning (tectogranmlatical repres-entations, TR's\]; these TR's serve as inputstructures for the inference procedure tilatenriches the set of TR's selected by thesystem itself as possibly relevant for ananswer to the input question.
In this en-r iched set suitable TR's for direct and in-direct answers to the given quest ion areretrieved, and then transfered by a synth-esis procedure into the output (surface)form if sentences (for an outl ine of themethod as such, see Haji~ov~, 197~; 3aji~o-v~ and Sgall, 19~i; Sgall, 1982).B.
:?hat Kind of Structure Inferences ~houl~iBe Based onTo decide what kind of structures theinference procedure should operate, one hasto take into account several criteria, someof which seemingly contradict  each other:the structures should be as simple andtransparent as possible, so that inferenc-ing can be perfor,ued in a wel l -def ined way,and at the s~e ti~ue, these structures~hould be as"exDress ive"as the natural lang-uage sentences are, not to lose any pieceof information captured by the text.
"~atural language has a major draw-back in its ambiguity: when a l istener istold that the criticisl~ of the Pol ish del-egate was fully justif ied, one does notknow (unless indicated by the context orsituation) whether s/he should infer thatsoE~eone cr i t ic ized the Pol ish delegate, orwhether the Pol ish delegate cr i t ic izedsomeone/something.
On the other hand, thereare means in natural  language that are notpreserved by most languages that log ic ianshave used for drawing consequences, butthat are cr i t ical  for the latter to bedrawn correctly: when a l istener is toldthat ~ussiau is ~poken in SIBERIA, s/hedraws conclusions part ly d i f ferent  fromthose when s/he is told that in Siberla,RUS3IAN is spoken (caoitals denot ing theintonation center); or, to borrow one ofthe widely d iscussed examples in l inguist-ic writ ings,  if one hears that Jonn cal led:ary a ~U~LICA~ and that then she insult-ed I~IM, one should infer that the sneakerconsiders "being a ~eoubl ican" an insult~this is not the case, if the speaker saidthat then she I~SULTED hi~.These and similar cons iderat ions haveled the authors of T IDAn to a stronc con-v ict ion that the structures represent ingF.nowledge and serving as the base for in-ferencing in a q-uestion-answerin\[~ systemwith a natural  language interface shouldbe l inguist ica l ly  based: they should be de-prived of all ambiguit ies of natural  lang-uage and at the same til:ie they should pre-serve all the information relevant fordrawing conclus ions that the natural lanci-uage sentences encompass.

1II INFERENCE TYPESA.
\[q_eans of ImplementationThe inference rules are progranm~edin 9-1anguage (Colmerauer, 1982), whichprovides rules that carry out transforr~at~ions of oriented graphs.
Since the struct-ures accepted by the rules must not con-tain complex labels, every complex sy~bollabel l ing a no~e in WR's has the form of awhole subtree in the Q-language notation(in a "~-tree).The set of TR's constitutes a seman-tic network, in which the individu~l T!
{'sare connected into a com\[~lex whole hymeans of pointers between tl\]e occurrencesof lexical units and the correspondingentries in the lexicon.

there is no order-ing of the rules ).E.

The Retr ieval  ProcedureTh~ retr ieval  of an answer in the en-r iched set of assert ions (TR's) is perform-ed in the fol lowing stepsl(a) f irst it is checked whether thelexical value of the root of the TR is id-entical with that of the TR of the question;if the quest ion has the form "What is per-formed (done, carr ied out) by X?
", thenthe TR from the enr iched set must includean act ion verb as a label of its root;(b) the path leading from the root to thewh-word is checked (yes-no quest ions a re .excluded from the f irst stage of our exper-iments); the r ightmost path in the relevantTR must coincide with the wh-path in itslexical  labels, contextual--boundness,grammatemes and functors (with some poss-ible deviat ions determined by condit ionsof subst i tutabi l i ty:  Singular - Plural,Manner - Accompaniment,  etc.
); the wh-wordin the quest ion must be matched by ~- lex-ical unit of the potent ia l  answer, wherethe latter may be further expanded;(c~ if also the rest of the two comparedTR s meet the condit ions of identity orsubst i tutabi l i ty,  the relevant TR is mark-ed as a full answer to the given question;if this is not the case but at least oneof the nodes depending on a node includedin the wh-path meets these condit ions,  thenthe re levant TR is marked as an indirect(partial) answer.B.
Towards an E f fec t ive  App l i ca t ion  o fIn fe rence  Ru lesIn the course of the exper iments itsoon became clear that even with a veryl imited number of inference rules the mem-ory space was rapidly exceeded.
It wasthen necessary to find a way how to achie-ve an ef fect ive appl icat ion of the inferen-ce rules and at the same time not to re-strict the choice of re levant answers .Among other things, the fo l lowing issuesshould be taken into considerat ion:The rules subst i tut ing subtrees forsubtrees are used rather frequently, aswell as those subst i tut ing only a labelof one node (in the Q-tree, i.e.
one ele-ment of the complex symbol in the CDS),preserv ing the overal l  structure of thetree untouched.
These rules operate inboth direct ions,  so that it appears as use-ful to use in such cases a similar strat-egy as with synonymous expressions,  i.e.to decide on a single representat ion bothin the TR of the quest ion and that includ-ed in the stock of knowledge; this wouldlead to an important decrease of the num-ber of TR's that undergo further inferencetransformations.Only those TR's are selected for thefinal steps of the retr ieval  of the answer(see point (a) in III.A) that coincidewith the TR of the quest ion in the lexicallabel of the root, i.e.
the main verb.
Ifthe inference rules are ordered in such away that the rules changing an element ofthe label of the root are appl ied beforethe rest of the rules, then the firststep of the retr ieval  procedure can bemade before the appl icat ion of other in-ference rules.
This again leads to a con-295siderable reduct ion of the number of TR'son which the rest of the inference rulesare applied; only such TR's are left in thestock of relevant TR's(i)that agree with the TR of the quest ionin the label of the root (its ~exical lab-el may belong to superordinated or subord-inated lexioal values: device - amplif ier,etc.
),(ii) that i~clude the lexical label ofthe root oC the question in some otherplace than at the root of the relevantTR,(iii) if the quest ion has the form "WhichN " (i.e the wh-n~de depends on its ?
o -  , ohead in the relat ion of general relat ion-ship), then also those TR's are preservedthat contain an identical N node (noun)on any level of the tree.The use of Q- language brings aboutone diff iculty, namely that the ruleshave to be formulated for each level forthe tree separately.
It is possible toavoid this compl icat ion by a simple tempor-ary rearrangement of the Q-tree, which re-sults in a tree in which all nodes withlexical labels are on the same level; therules for a subst itut ion of the lexicallabels can be then applied in one step,after which the tree is "returned" intoits or iginal  shape.These and similar considerat ions haveled us to the fol lowing ordering of the in-d iv idual  steps of the inference and retr ie-val procedure:I. appl icat ion of rules transformingthe input structure to such an extent thatthe lexlcal label of the root of the treeis not preserved in the tree of a potent-ial answer;2. a partial retr ieval of the answeraccording to the root of the tree;3. appl icat ion of rules subst i tut ingother labels pert inent to the root of thetree;4. partial retr ieval of the answeraccording to the root of the tree;5. appl icat ion of inference rulesoperat inq on a single tree;6. appl icat ion of inference rulesoperat ing on two trees;7. the steps (b) and (c) from theretr ieval of the answer (see II I .A above).REFERENCESColmerauer A., 1982, Les systemes Q ou unformal isme pour analyser et syn=n& Ttiser des phra~;es sur ordinateur,mimeo; Germ.transl .
