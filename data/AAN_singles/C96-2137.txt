j pAbst ractThis paper proposes a method to resolvethe reference of deictic Japanese zeropronouns which can be implemented ina practical machine translation system.This method focuses on semantic andpragmatic onstraints uch as semanticconstraints on cases, modal expressions,verbal semantic attributes and conjunc-tions to determine the deictic referenceof Japanese zero pronouns.
This methodis highly effective because the volume ofknowledge that must be prepared before-hand is not very large and its precisionof resolution is good.
This method wasimplemented in the Japanese-to-Englishmachine translation system, ALT-J/E.According to a window test for 175 zeropronouns with deictic referent in a sen-tence set for the evaluation of Japanese-to-English machine translation systems,all of zero pronouns could be resolvedconsistently and correctly.1 In t roduct ionIn all natural anguage, elements that can be eas-ily deduced by the reader are frequently omittedfrom expressions in texts (Kuno, 1978).
This phe-nomenon causes considerable problems in naturallanguage processing systems.
For example in amachine translation system, the system needs torecognize that elements which are not present inthe source language, may become mandatory el-ements in the target language.
In particular, thesubject and object are often omitted in Japanese;whereas they are often mandatory in English.Thus, in Japanese-to-English machine translationsystems, it is necessary to identify case elementsomitted from the original Japanese (these are re-ferred to as "zero pronouns") for their translationinto English expressions.Several methods have been proposed with re-gard to this problem (Kameyama, 1986) (Walkeret al, 1990) (Yoshimoto, 1988) (Dousaka, 1994).When considering the application of these meth-ods to a practical machine translation system forwhich the translation target area can not be lim-ited, it is not possible to apply them directly, bothbecause their precision of resolution is low as theyonly use limited information, and because the vol-ume of knowledge that must be prepared betbre-hand is so large.The zero pronouns that must be resolved by amachine translation system carl be classitied into 3types; (a) zero pronouns with antecedents withinthe same sentence (intrasenteutial), (b) zero pro-nouns with antecedents elsewhere in the text (in-tersentential) and (c) zero pronouns with deicticreference (extrasentential).
Regarding type (b),Nakaiwa and Ikehara (1992) proposed a methodto determine the intersentential ntecedents us--ing verbal semantic attributes.
The rules usedin this method are independent of the field ofthe source text.
Therefore, anaphora resolutionmay be conducted with a relatively small volumeof knowledge, making the proposed method verysuitable for machine translation systems.
Further-more, for type (a), Nakaiwa and \[kehara(1995)proposed a method to determine the intrasenten-tim antecedents of Japanese zero pronouns usingsemantic onstraints uch as verbal semantic at-tributes and pragmatic onstraints uch as typesof conjunctions and modal expressions.In this paper, we propose a widely applica-ble method to determine the deictic referents ofJapanese zero pronouns (type (c)) using not onlysemantic onstraints to the c~es but also fln:thersemantic onstraints uch as verbal semantic at-tributes and pragmatic onstraints such as modalexpressions and types of conjunctions.2 Appearance  o f  Zero  P ronouns  inJapanese TextsIn order to understand the distribution of zeropronouns with antecedents hat do not appeal" inthe text, in this section, we examine which zeropronouns nmst be resolved and where their an-tecedents appear, using a test set designed to eval-uate the performance of Japanese-to-English ma-812chine translat ion systems ( lkehara et al, 1994).'
l 'he results of the examinat ion of zero pronounsand their referential elements in the f lmctionaltest sentence set (3718 sentences) are shown inTable l. There were ~, total  of 512 zero pronomlsin 463 sentences.
The location of referential ele-ments can be divided into 2 kinds: those expressedin the same sentence, and those, not expressed inthe same sentence.
'r im latter were fltrther classi-tied into 6 kinds.?
The zero pronoun is not translated be(:ause thepassive voi(:e is used.?
The referent is the writer or speaker, I or agrollp~ we.?
'\['he referent is the reader or hemmer, you,?
The referent is human but it is not known whothe human is.?
The zero pronoun shouhl be translated as it.?
The rcf(,rent is another specitic element.According to this study of the f imctional testsentence set, in 373 out of 512 instances (73%)the antecedent was not expressed in the sentence.Zero pronouns conhl be left unexpressed by con-verting the translat ion to the passive voice in 173instances (34%).
'Fhe other zero pron(mns, 200instances (39%), referred to antecedents that (lidnot appear in the sentence.
\[n 69 ()tit, of the 200instances (13%) zero pronouns were th.e subject  ofthe sentence and referred to the writer or speakerI or a group we.
Further  examinat ion revealedthat only in these 69 instances did the verb thatgoverned them express some modal i ty  such as -shilai '- want to -'  or -shiyou 'Let us -'  or theverbs were omou ' tMnk'  and other such words in-dicating ~TI\]\[INKING ACTION'.
Furthermore,  zeropronouns that  were the subjects and that referredto the reader or hearer you, ainounted to 28 outof the 200 instances (5%).
In these 28 instances,~he verbs that  governed these zero pronouns ex-pressed the modal i t ies o f -  subekida 'should'  or-s i tehanaranai  'nmst n(it'.
Similarly, modal it iesand verb types can be used to identify it or the'unknown human' .
This tyl)e of zero t)ron(mncan be resolved by deducing their referents us-ing modal i ty  or categor:ized verl)al semantic at-tr i lmtes.3 Deictic Resolution of JapaneseZero Pronounslhused on the results shown in section 2, we pro-pose a method to resolve Japanese zero pronounswhose antecedents do not appear  in the texts.3.1 Dei ( ' t le  Reso lu t ion  us ing  Semant icConst ra in ts  on  Cases~lb resolve Japanese zero pronouns whose an-tecedents do not appear within the texts, it is pos-sible to use the semantic  onstraints on verbs'  caseTable 1: Distr ibut ion of zero pronouns and theirreferential elements~ ~  Loc.

I t~lelements to deduce like.ly referents.
The semanticinformation used to est imate supplement ing ele-ments is similar to the constraints on cases usedtbr selecting the transfer patterns in a machinetranslation systeln.
Figure \[ shows an examph:of a transtb.r pat tern  in a Japanese-to-Engl ish tna-chine translat ion syst, em for the ,lapanese~ verb iki-masu 'gC.
Figure 1 shows how, if the ,lapane.severb is ik imasu 'go' and the noun phr~use with a gapc.riMe, which shows a subject,  has the senmnticat t r ibute SUBJECT, VEIIICLES OR, ANIMALS~ thenthe verb should be translated as 'go'.
In this pat-tern, if Lit(; suhject N I beeonles a zero l)ronoun,the system tries to est imate the referent using se-mantic constraints.
But, in this case., it is impos-sible to est imate the referent as one type, be.causethere are three kinds of semantic constraints.
Inthe transfer pattern,  the semantic  constraints areleft unfulfilled if they are not used in selectingthe appropr iate translat ion.
So, this method fre-quently l)oses di\[\[iculties in pinpoint ing elementsto be est imated.According to die results that  were examined insection 2, this type of zero pronoun can be re-solved by deducing I;heir reDrents not only /ts-ing semantic constraints to the cases but also us-ing modal i ty  or categorized verbal semantic atotr ibutes.
For example, in this case, it is efl'cetiveto determine the referents corresponding to ' I '  its-ing the verbal semantic at t r ibutes of the pattern,N \[ 'S PIIYSI(JAL TRANSI,'ER and the polite exl)res-sion -maser .NI(suBJEC'rS, VEHICLES OR ANIMALS)-ga iki-mcu~uN\]-SUBJ go-I'OLITB=> N I go.Figure l: J apanese-toq~Jnglish transfer dict ionary3.2 De ie t i c  Re, so lu t ion  us ing  Semant icand  Pragmat ic  Const ra in tsAccording to the analysis of the results shownin section 2, we found that modal  expressionsand verbal semantic a.ttribntes are usefltl in (le-retraining the dei('tic referents of Japanese zeropronouns.
Also, we can est imate the types of con-jun<:tions that are effe(:tive in determining the tel<813erents in a complex sentence.
In this section, weexamine three kinds of semantic and pragmaticconstraints, modal expressions, verbal semanticattributes arid conjunctions.3.2.1 Const ra in ts  Based  on  Moda lExpress ionsModal expressions in Japanese are expected Cobe the most powerful constraints for estimatingdeictie reference.
For example, in the case of zeroprononns in ga-cases 'subject',  the referent be-comes the writer or speaker, I or a group, we if thesentence has the modal expressions, -sitai '4) wantto -' HOPF, or -silchosii '?
want ?
to - '  CAUSATIVEHOI'E; the referent becomes the reader or hearer,you if the sentence has the modal expressions, -sileha-ikenai '4) must not -' PR()IIIBIT or -subekida'?
should -' OBLmA'rmN.
If there are no refer-eat candidates found within the surrounding text,the referents can be determined using the previousconstraints based on modal expressions.3.2.2 Constra ints  based on Verba lSmnant ie  At t r ibutesConstraints b~sed on verbal semantic attributescan be divided into tile \[bllowing two types:(1) Constra ints  based on the  types  o f  verbs'Give and take' expressions such as the verbsmoran 'get' and yaru 'give' and transfer expres-sions such as the verbs iku 'go' and h'ur'u 'come'can deternfine the referents of zero pronouns with-out modal expressions.
For example, if the ga-case(subject) of the sentence whose verb is ,nora'tt 'get'becolnes a zero pronoun, the referent becomes 1.In the case of verb kuru 'come', the referent be-comes an element other than i, tbr example you.These kinds of verbs inrplicitly indicate tile rela-tionship between the writer/speaker and the ref-erent of the ga-case (for example, the empathy(Kuno, 1978) or the side of the territory of in-fbrmation (Kmnio, 1985)).
Based on these prop-erties, tire deictic referents of Japanese zero pro-nouns (:an be estimated.
(2) Constra ints  based on the  types  o f  verbsand  moda l  express iousI,;ven if the referents of zero pronouns (:an not bedetermined using modal expressions or tile typesof verbs, the referents can sometimes be deter-mined using a combination of modal expressionsand the types of verbs.
For example, it1 the fol-lowing Japanese expression, the ga-case becomesa zero pronoun.
(1) hon-wo gon-da?-SUBJ book-OI3J \]read-PASTI read a book.In this sentence the experience of thewriter/speaker, 1 is suitable for the reference ofthe zero pronoun.
As shown in this sentence, ifthe ga-c~use in an expression with a verb whosesemantic attr ibute is ACTION and modal expre.s-sion is -ta PAST, becomes a zero pronoun, it willbe translated by a truman translator ~s 1.
In asimilar way, if the ga-case in an expression witha verb whose semantic attr ibute is ACT1ON andmodal expression is -darou 'will' FSTIMA'FION, be-comes a zero l)ronottn, the referent is you.
Suchconstraints using both verbal semantic attributesand modal expressions can be used to determinethe deictic reference of 3 apanese zero pronouns.To write constraints based on types of verbs eflbx:-tively, we used the 97 verbal semantic attributes(VSA) proposed by Nakaiwa (1994).3.2.3 Const ra in ts  based  on Con junct ionsSometimes the deictic referents of Japanese zeropronouns can be determined depending on thetypes of conjunctions.
The constraints based onthe Japanese conjunctions can be divided into thefollowing two types.
(1) The  eonst ra ln ts  on  <:as(; shar ing  depend-ing on the  types  o f  con junct ionsMinami (1974) and Takubo (1987) proposed that(lilt'event Japanese conjunctions cover or sharedifferent cases, l,'or example Minanfi dividedJapanese conjnnctions into three kinds, A, B andC.
A complex sentence which includes A typeJapanese conjunctions, such as tsu-Lsu 'while' andnagara 'while', shares one ha-case ('l'opie) and onega-ea,se (Subject).
In the case of B type Japaneseconjullctions, stlch a8 lzodc 'because' or tara 'iF,one ha.-c~e is shared but not the ga-case.
Inthe case of C type J a I)an esc conj u actions, such askcredo 'but '  or kedo 'but', neither the ha-case northe ga-case are necessarily shared.
According tothis classification, if two ga-cases in a complex sin>tence joined by an A type Japanese conjunctionwere to become zero pronouns and the referentof one of the two zero pronouns wins determinedby the constraints proposed previously, then thereferent of the other zero pronoun is the same ref-erent.
These characteristics of Japanese c(mjunc-tions can be used to determine the refit'rents ofzero pronouns.
(2) Const ra in ts  based  on con junct ions ,inoda l  express ions  and  verba l  semant ic  at-tr ibutesSometimes co-occurrence of conjunctions, verbalsemantic attributes and moda.l expressions in acomplex sentence determines the meaning of thesentence, and sometimes they determine the deic-tic referen(;e of zero pronouns in the sentence.
Forexample, in the following Japanese expression, th(~subject of the verb ika-nai 'go-not'  becomes a zeropronoun but the referent can be determin(;d as thewriter or speaker, you.
(2) tokoya-ni ika-nai to,?-SUBJ b~'ber-IND-O13 J go-not ifIf you don't go to the tmrber,kami-ga boubou-ni-naruhair  begin to look unt2dyyour hair will begin to look untidy.814This sentence has the meaning that  the wr i te ror speaker advises that  if you do not do some-thing, a situation will arise.
The meaning type ofa complex sentence can be determined using therules that  the eOBjlIIICtiO\[I is tO ' i f '  and in the subclause ga-case beeoInes a zero pronoun and tilemeaning; o\[' the verb is ACTION with negation andin the main clause the meaning of the verb is A'P-'PlLIBU'FE with tnoda\] expression i -uaru  'become'AT'I'ItlB U'\['\],', '\['ltA N S FE \[1..'\['he meaning type of a complex sentence canhe determined using the tblowing ruh'.s: when thecon.imletion is ' if ' ~md the sill) clause ga-c;~se be-(;on~es a zero \ ] \ ]FOl IO/ I l l ,  and the meanil~g of the verbis aCTION with negation, and in the main cla.usethe meaning of the verb is ATTRIBUT\],; with modalexpression, then n i -naru  q)eeome' is an exampleof  A'\["PI{IBUTE TRANSI,'I~3R.
Using these kinds ofrules, the meaning types o1" complex sentences canI)e determined, and the reference of zero pr(m(mnsc.an be deterufine.d.3.3 A lgor i thmIn this sul)section, we t)ropose an algor ithm forthe deictic resolution of Japanese zero pronounsusing the constraints proposed in this section.This a lgor i thm was implemented in a Japanese-tod,3nglish machine translat ion system, so the onlyzero pron(mns that must be resolved are those tlu~tbecome mandatory  elernents in li\]nglish.
To real-ize the previously proposed condit ions in an al-gorithm, we must consider eases when these tm-tece(lelll, s exist in the same selitellCe ;ts well aswhen these antecedents exist in another sent, encesin the text, and we must  design the algor ithm toincrease the eve.rail accuracy of the resolution ofzero pronouns.Anaphora  resolution of zero pronouns is con-ducted as follows.
In each step in the algorithm,when the referential element within or without thetext is determined,  the system checks not only thecondit ions that are written in the following algo-r ithm, I)ut also the semantic  ondit ions that  verbsimpose on zero pronouns in tile case elements ineach pat tern  of the Japanese-to-Engl ish transferdictionaries.l) \])etection of zero pronouns.If they exist, proceed to step 2.2) \[CXttlttilte whether there ~r(."

show the results of evaluationof the method that  was proposed above.
Themethod to resolve zero pronouns with deictic ref-erence was tested using the Japanese-to- l 'hlgl ishmachine translat ion system AI / \ [ ' - J /F ,  ( lkehara etal., 1991).
The criteria for tile evaluat ion and pro-eedures  used were as folh)ws.8154.1.1 Reso lut ion  TargetThe target was to resolve successfully the fivetypes of zero pronouns (ga-case ~-- 'T' or "we", ga-case e- "you" , ga-case +-- HUMAN, ga-case ~-- "it", hi-case ~- "you"; 175 instances).
These are thezero pronouns with deictic reference found withinthe 512 zero pronouns in the a718 sentence setfor the evaluation of Japanese-to-English machinetranslation systems.4.1.2 Rules to Resolve Zero P ronounsThe rules to resolve 175 zero pronouns were cre-ated by examining these zero pronouns using theconstraints discussed in section 3 (46 rule@.4.1.3 Tests for the Eva luat ion'l'o examine the relationship between conditionsof resolution and accuracy of resolution, we con-ducted the following two tests.
(1) Reso lut ion  aeeuraey for eondit ions ofresolut ionWe examined the accuracy of resolution depend-ing on the types of conditions in a.naphora reso-lutiou such as semantic onstraints to the cases,modal expression, verbal semantic attributes andconjunctive xpressions.
We evaluated the accu-racy depending on the types of constraints used.
(2) Reso lut ion  accuracy  for rule complex i tyWe examined the accuracy of the resohttions tosee how they were affected by the complexities ofthe rules that were used in the resolution.
In thistest we evaluated the accuracy using simple, easilycreated and universal rules.4.2 Reso lut ion  Accuracy  for Condi t ionsof Reso lut ionTo examine the resolution accuracy under differ-ent conditions, we examined the accuracy of themethod proposed in this paper with the tbllowing4 kinds of conditions:?
using conditions of semantic onstraints on casesonly?
using conditions of semantic onstraints on casesand modal expression?
using conditions of semantic onstraints on cases,modal expression and verbal semantic attributes?
using conditions of semantic onstraints on cases,modal expression, verbal semantic attributes andconjunctionsTable 3 shows the results of the resolution de-pending on the types of the rules.
As shown intAt the moment, it is difficult to use sentenceswhich were not successfully syntactically and semanti-cally a.nalyzed for the evaluation of our method.
So, toevaluate the technical limitation of proposed method,we evaluated the resolution accuracy in the sentenceswhich were examined to make the 46 rules (windowtest).
We will conduct blind tests after we have fin-ished debugging the whole system.this table, all 175 zero pronouns can be resolvedusing the rules that were proposed in section 3.The.
introduction of verbal semantic attributes hasachieved the same accuracy of resolution as the in--troduction of modM expressions (41 entries, 24%).From this result, we can say that the verbal se-mantic attributes are comparatively as effectiveas modal expressions.
The results also show that, without using the constraints of conjunctions,the accuracy achieved is as high as 85%.4.3 Reso lut ion  Accuracy  against  RuleComplex i tyTo examine how the resolution accuracy variedaccording to the complexity of' rules, we tested theaccuracy of the method proposed in this paper atdifferent levels of complexity.
The complexities Cwere evaluated using the following formula, anddepended on the number of constraints used.C = # of modal const.
* 1 + # of VSA coast.
* 1+ # of conjunctions coast.
* 2In this formula, 1 in the modal and VSA and2 in the conjunction indicate the weights.
Be-cause conjunction constraints affect both sides ofthe unit sentence, we gave the conjunctions con-straints a weight of 2.
According to this formula,the complexity of a rule that has a constraint fbrconjunctions and for VSA in the main clause andfor modM and VSA in the sub clause, becoines 5(--l(modal)*l + I(VSA)*2 + 2(conjunction)*l).Table 4 shows the accuracy of the resolution de-pending on the complexities of the rules.
46 kindsof rules were used in the deictic resolution of 175zero pronouns as shown in |;able 4.
The accuracyof resolution using rules with complexities of 3 orless, is 90%, and the accuracy of resolution us-ing rules with complexities of 4 or less, is 95%.This result shows that the use of the constraintsbased on modM expressions, VSA and conjunc-tions can achieve high accuracy using relativelysimple rules.5 ConclusionThis paper proposes a powerful method for theresolution of Japanese zero pronouns with deic-tic reference.
It was found possible to resolve allof the sentences in the window test where thereferential elements were not in the sentence re-solved.
This was achieved by the introduction ofrules based on four kinds of constraints: seman-tic constraints on cases, modal expressions, verbalsemantic attributes and conjunctions.
In the fu-ture, we will examine the universality of the rulesthat have been discussed in this paper by applyingthem to other texts and examine a method tbr au-tomatically acquiring the rules needed to resolvezero pronouns with deictic references.Acknowledgments :  We would like to thankProfessor Satoru lkehara of 'lbttori University forproviding valuable comments and suggestions.816'l'able 3: l{esolution accuracy for conditions of resolution\] ,OC~ttiOllof ZeroPPOI IOMn8ga-caso(~.bj)Ili-(:as{(ind.obj.
