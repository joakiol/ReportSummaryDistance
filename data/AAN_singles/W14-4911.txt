LAW VIII - The 8th Linguistic Annotation Workshop, pages 75?81,Dublin, Ireland, August 23-24 2014.Semi-Semantic Part of Speech Annotation and EvaluationQaiser AbbasFachbereich SprachwissenschaftUniversit?at Konstanz78457 Konstanz, Germanyqaiser.abbas@uni-konstanz.deAbstractThis paper presents the semi-semantic part of speech annotation and its evaluation via Krip-pendorff?s ?
for the URDU.KON-TB treebank developed for the South Asian language Urdu.The part of speech annotation with the additional subcategories of morphology and semanticsprovides a treebank with sufficient encoded information.
The corpus used is collected from theUrdu Wikipedia and news papers.
The sentences were annotated manually to ensure a high an-notational quality.
The inter-annotator agreement obtained after evaluation is 0.964, which liesin the range of perfect agreement on a scale.
Urdu is comparatively an under-resourced languageand the development of the treebank with rich part of speech annotation will have significantimpact on the state-of-the-art for Urdu language processing.1 IntroductionUrdu, an invariant of Hindavi came into existence during the muslim rule from 1206 AD to 1858AD (Khan, 2006).
They used Persian/Urdu script for Urdu in contrast of the Devanagari script for Hin-davi.
Urdu became a literary language after existence of an increasing number of literature during 18thand 19th century (McLane, 1970).
Hindi/Hindavi is a close language to Urdu except the script writingstyle and the differences in the formal and informal versions.
Urdu is the national language of Pakistanand an official language in India.
According to a report by SIL Ethnologue (Lewis, 2013), Urdu/Hindihas 456.2 million speakers in the whole world.
Urdu is a morphologically rich language (MRL) and inneed of a number of resources to compete in the race of computational resources.The design of the part of speech (POS) annotation scheme depends upon the need.
If the peoplewant to do text processing, text mining, etc., then they might be interested in a limited POS annotationscheme.
However, the people who are interested in language parsing, then a POS annotation schemewith rich information is needed.
Getting state-of-the-art parsing results for a MRL is a challenge till todate.
According to Tsarfaty et.
al.
(2013; 2010), without proper handling of morphological entities inthe sentences, promising results for MRLs can not be achieved and the depth of information encodedin an annotation correlates with the parsing performance.
The best broad coverage and robust parsersto date have grammars extracted from the treebanks, which are a collection of syntactically annotatedsentences by humans.
The problem statement described requires an explicit encoding of morphologicalinformation at the POS level and the treebanks with sufficient encoding of morphology, POS, syntacticand functional information are the best candidates to provide the state-of-the-art parsing results in case ofMRLs.
The work presented here is the part of a large effort made for the construction of the URDU.KON-TB treebank, which was built by considering the parsing needs of Urdu.
The annotation scheme of thetreebank contains semi-semantic POS (SSP), semi-semantic syntactic (SSS) and functional (F) tag sets,from which only the SSP tag set is presented here along with its annotation evaluation.The relevant resources of Urdu are now growing but most of the resources lack in morphological andfunctional information.
The initial corpus developed in the EMILLE project (McEnery et al., 2000) com-prised multi-lingual corpora for the South Asian languages.
Its Urdu part was annotated according to aThis work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

It was so detailed that the Urdu computational linguists avoided itto practice in statistical parsing, even it was a good effort.
However, now the computational linguistsare realizing and attempting morphological information in their annotation (Manning, 2011).
In (2007),Urdu ParGram project introduced a resource that lied in the domain of tree-banking.
In this project, Urdulexical functional grammar (LFG) was encoded, which is still in progress.
The LFG grammar encodedhas rich morphological information, but unfortunately, the annotation scheme is not published yet dueto their different motives towards the parallel treebank development.
Similarly, in (2009), Sajjad andSchmid presented a new POS annotation scheme, which lacks in morphological, syntactical and func-tional information.
Due to which, it can only be used for the training of POS taggers and is not suitablefor the parsing purpose.
Moreover, the explicit annotation evaluation was not performed.
Another POStag set was devised by Muaz et.
al.
in (2009), which contained 32 general POS tags.
The devisedscheme has the same issues as mentioned in the work of Sajjad and Schmid (2009).
In (2009), Abbas et.al.
built the first NU-FAST treebank for Urdu with the POS and syntactic labels only.
The design of thattreebank neither contained detailed morphological and functional information nor any information aboutthe displaced constituents, empty arguments, etc.
Another Hindi-Urdu tree-banking (HUTB) (Bhatt etal., 2009; Palmer et al., 2009) effort was done in a collaborative project1.
However, the Urdu treebankbeing developed was comparatively small and was being done as a part of a larger effort at establish-ing a treebank for Hindi.
Moreover, many of the issues with respect to Urdu were not quite addressedand the project is still in progress.
To continue this effort, another treebank for Urdu was designed byAbbas in (2012), which comprised of 600 annotated sentences and it was done without the annotationevaluation.The current work presented in this paper, not only enhances the size of the proposed treebank byAbbas (2012), but also resolves the annotation issues along with the complete annotation guidelines andits evaluation.
The development of the URDU.KON-TB treebank starts with the collection of a corpusdiscussed briefly in Section 2.
The semi-semantic (partly or partially semantic) POS (SSP) annotationscheme is described in Section 3.
Similarly, the evaluation of the SSP annotation is presented in Section 4along with a brief presentation of annotation issues.
Finally, the conclusion is given in Section 5 and thedetailed version of the SSP tag set is given in Appendix.2 Corpus CollectionOne thousand (1000) sentences taken from the corpus (Ijaz and Hussain, 2007) are extensively modifiedto get rid of licensing constraints, because we want to share our corpus freely under a Creative-Commons-Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0 or higher.
The next four hundred (400) sentences are collected fromthe Urdu Wikipedia2, which is already under the same license.
Thus the size of the corpus is limited tofourteen hundred (1400) sentences.
The corpus contains text of local & international news, social stories,sports, culture, finance, history, religion, traveling, etc.3 Semi-Semantic POS (SSP) AnnotationAfter the annotation evaluation presented in Section 4, the revised annotation scheme of theURDU.KON-TB treebank has a semi-semantic POS (SSP), semi-semantic syntactic (SSS) and a func-tional (F) tag set.
The term semi-semantic (partly or partially semantic) is used with the POS becausethe tags are compounded with the semantic tags partially e.g.
a noun house with spatial semantics taggedas N.SPT, an adjective previous in the previous year with temporal semantics tagged as ADJ.TMP, etc.The same concept is applied on the SSS annotation.
The details of SSS and F labeling is beyond thescope of this paper.
At POS level, a dot ?.?
is used to add morphological and semantical subcategoriesinto the main POS categories displayed in Table 1 of Appendix.
The POS, morphological and semanticalinformation all together, make a rich SSP annotation scheme for the URDU.KON-TB treebank.
Theneed for such type of schemes is highly advocated in (Clark et al., 2010; Skut et al., 1997), etc.1http://verbs.colorado.edu/hindiurdu/2http://ur.wikipedia.org/wiki/??
@ ?fj?
?76A simple POS tag set was devised first, which had twenty two (22) main POS-tag categories describedin Table 1 of Appendix, which includes some non-familiar tags like HADEES and M to represent theArabic statements of prophets in Urdu text and a phrase or a sentence marker, respectively.
The labelsfor morphological and semantic subcategories are presented in Tables 2 and 3 of Appendix, respectively,which can be added to the 22 main POS tag categories by using a dot ?.?
symbol in the form of compoundtags like N.SPT and ADJ.TMP mentioned earlier.
In case of morphology, if a verb V has a perfectivemorphology, then the compound tag becomes V.PERF.
The SSP tag set was refined during the manualannotation process of the sentences and further refined after the annotation evaluation process discussedin Section 4.
The final refined form of the SSP tag set depicted in Table 4 of Appendix is the revised formof the POS tag set presented in the initial version of the URDU.KON-TB treebank by Abbas in (2012).As an example, consider the ADJ (adjective) from the final refined form of the SSP tag set given inAppendix, which is divided into five subcategories of tags DEG (Degree), ECO (Echo), MNR (Manner),SPT (Spatial) and TMP (Temporal).
Relevant examples are provided in 1 of Appendix.
The example 1(a)of Appendix is a simple case of ADJ, while 1(b) of Appendix is the case of a degree adjective3annotatedwith ADJ.DEG.
The example 1(c) of Appendix is the case of reduplication4(Abbi, 1992; B?ogel et al.,2007).
Reduplication has two versions.
First Echo Reduplication is discussed in the footnote, while theother Full Word Reduplication is the repetition of the original word e.g.
sAtH sAtH ?with/alongwith?.These are adopted in our annotation as ECO (echo) and the REP (repetition), respectively.
The example1(d) of Appendix is the case of adjective having a sense of manner annotated as ADJ.MNR.
If an adjectivequalifies an action noun, then a sense of action or something is produced, whose behavior or the wayto do that action is exploited through ADJ.MNR e.g.
z4AlemAnah t2abdIlIyAN ?brutal changes?.
Anexercise of manner adjectives and manner adverbs for English can be seen at Cambridge University5.
Theexample 1(e) of Appendix is the case of an adjective having a temporal sense discussed earlier.
Finally,the example 1(f) of Appendix is the case of an adjective having a spatial sense.
The adjective used hereis the derivational form of a city name ?Multan?, but it appears here as an adjective and annotated asADJ.SPT6like in this sentence e.g.
voh Ek pAkistAnI laRkA hE ?He is a pakistani boy?.Example 1 of Appendix exploited the POS tags for adjectives along with the semantic tagging likeTMP, SPT, MNR, etc.
However, to give an introduction about morphology and verb functions, anotherPOS category of verb V given in Appendix is presented.
It is divided into 11 subcategories, which includeCOP (copula verb), IMPERF (imperfective morphological form of verb), INF (infinitive form of verb),LIGHT (1st light verb with nouns and adjectives), LIGHTV (2nd light verb with verbs), MOD (modalverb), PERF (perfective morphology), ROOT (root form), SUBTV (subjunctive form), PAST (past tenseof a verb) and PRES (present tense of a verb).
These tags have further subcategories.
All tags representsdifferent morphological forms and the function of a verb that it governs.
A few high quality studies wereadopted to identify different forms and functions of Urdu verbs (Butt, 2003; Butt, 1995; Butt and Rizvi,2010; Butt and Ramchand, 2001; Butt, 2010; Abbas and Raza, 2014; Abbas and Nabi Khan, 2009) andsome annotated sentences from the URDU.KON-TB treebank are given in example 2 of Appendix.The sentence in example 2(a) of Appendix is the case of adjective-verb complex verb predicate.
Theseadjective/noun-verb complex predicates were first proposed by Ahmed and Butt (2011).
The adjectivedubHar ?hard?
and the verb kiyA ?did?
with a perfective morphology yA at the end are annotated as a ADJand a V.LIGHT.PERF, respectively.
Similarly, a perfective verb liyA ?took?
after a root form of verb kar?do?
is an example of the verb-verb complex predicate depicted in 2(d) of Appendix.
This constructionis adopted from the studies given in (Butt, 2010).
The next sentence in 2(b) of Appendix has a passiveconstruction, which can be inferred from the inflected form of a verb or a verb auxiliary jAnA ?to go?preceded by another verb with perfective morphology.
To explore some unusual tags, a long sentence3This division is used to represent absolute, comparative and superlative degree in adjectives and adverbs.4In Urdu like other South Asian languages, the reduplication of a content word is frequent.
Its effect is only to strengthenthe proceeding word or to expand the specific idea of a proceeding word into a general form e.g.
kAm THIk-THAk karnA ?Dothe work right?
or kOI kapRE-vapRE dE dO ?Give me the clothes or something like those?.5http://www.cambridge.org/grammarandbeyond/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Communicative_Activity_Hi-BegIntermediate-Adjectives_and_Adverbs.pdf6Spatial adjectives are used to describe a place/location, direction or distance e.g.
multAnI ?Multani?, aglI ?next?, and dUr?far?
respectively.77is presented in 2(c) of Appendix.
After the name of prophets or righteous religious-personalities, somespecific and limited prayers called s3alAvAt ?prayers?
like sal-lal-la-ho-a2lEhE-va-AlEhI-salam ?MayAllah grant peace and honor on him and his family?, a2lEh salAm ?peace be upon him?, etc., in Arabic isthe most likely in Urdu text and annotated as the PRAY.
Similarly, the statements of prophet Muhammad(PBUH) known as h2adIs2 ?narration?
like In-namal-aa2mAlo-bin-niyAt ?The deeds are considered bythe intensions?
in Arabic script is also a tradition in Urdu text and annotated as the HADEES.
The phrasemarkers like comma, double quotes, single quotes, etc.
are annotated with the M.P and sentence markerlike full-stop, question mark, etc., are annotated with the M.S as presented in the same example.4 SSP Annotation EvaluationThe SSP annotation evaluation was performed via Krippendorff?s ?
coefficient (Krippendorff, 2004),which is a statistical measure to evaluate the reliability annotation or the inter-annotator agreement (IAA).Krippendorff?s ?
(Krippendorff, 1970; Krippendorff, 2004) satisfies all our needs including randomnominal data and five number of annotators in contrast to multi-pi (Fleiss, 1971) and multi-?
(Cohenand others, 1960), which can handle only fixed nominal data and they are basically not designed formore than two annotators (Artstein and Poesio, 2008; Carletta et al., 1997).
The nominal data given toannotators for the SSP annotation was not fixed.
In this situation, the general form of the Krippendorff?s?
coefficient was selected to meet this requirement.For the reliability evaluation of the SSP annotation guidelines, it was essential that the annotatorsshould be the native speakers of Urdu along with the linguistics skills.
To fulfill this purpose, an un-dergraduate class of 25 linguistic students was trained at the Department of English, University of Sar-godha7, Pakistan.
During this training, thirty two lectures on annotation guidelines with practical ses-sions were delivered.
The duration of each lecture was of 3 hours.
The class was further divided intofive groups and during their initial practical sessions, one student with a high caliber of understandingfrom each group was selected (but not informed) secretly for the final annotation.
The annotation taskof 100 random sentences was divided into 10 home assignments, which were then given to all students(including 5 secret students) periodically with an instruction not to discuss it with each other.
The anno-tation performed by the selected 5 students was then recorded and evaluated.
The value of ?
coefficientobtained after evaluation is 0.964 for the SSP annotation, which is narrated as a good reliability in (Krip-pendorff, 2004) and lies in the category of perfect agreement according to a scale in (Landis and Koch,1977).
It also means that the IAA is 0.964 and the SSP annotation guidelines are reliable.The issues found before and after the annotation evaluation concludes the addition, deletion or revisionof several tags.
For example, the continuous auxiliary rahA/VAUX.PROG.PERF and its inflected formscan behave as a copula verb as V.COP.PERF, which was not considered in the initial work.
The annotatorsdid not respond well during the annotation of complex predicates, so their identification rules are revisedwhich includes tense, passive, modal, etc., auxiliaries or verbs can not behave as complex predicate e.g.VAUX.LIGHT.MOD is not possible in the updated version.
Similarly, the KER tag for identification ofa special clause ending with kar/V.KER kE/KER ?after doing?, was found to be ambiguous and deleted.It was updated with their genuine tags as kar/V.ROOT kE/CM.5 ConclusionSufficient rich information in the SSP annotation was encoded to meet the parsing needs of MRL Urdu.The ?
coefficient value obtained advocates the quality of the SSP annotation along with the completeannotation guidelines for the URDU.KON-TB treebank.
Such kind of annotated corpus with rich mor-phology and semantics is not only useful for the parsing purpose but can be used for the training of POStaggers, text mining, language identification (Abbas et al., 2010) and in many other applications as well.AcknowledgementsSpecial thanks to Professor Miriam Butt, due to which linguistically rich the URDU.KON-TB treebankis existing and she participated overwhelmingly in the annotation process of this treebank.7http://uos.edu.pk/78ReferencesQaiser Abbas and A Nabi Khan.
