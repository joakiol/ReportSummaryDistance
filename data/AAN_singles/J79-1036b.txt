This paper investigates the power and use ofreference in natural language.
and the problems involved in its resolution.An algorithm is sketched for accomplishing reference resolution usinga notion of cross-sentential focus, a mechanism fo r  hypothesizing allpossible contextual references, and a judgment mechanism for  dis -~r i rn ina t i  ng among the hypotheses.The reference resolution problemThe present work began as an attempt to develop a set  ofalgorithms and/or heurietics to enable a primitive-based, inference -driven model of a natural language user (Schank 1972 Rieger 1974) toproperly resolve pronomial references acmee eentence bmndaries.
Theauthors quickly realized, however, that the problem of pronomial referenceresolution is only a .small aspect of a problem which might be termednominal reference resolution, itself but a 8-11 aspect of the problem 'ofthe coherence of d text, (or conversation) i, em the manner in which itllmeansu more than the logicd conjunction of the meaningp of its in-dividual constituent aentences,Examples of tqe f i rs t  problem, i. e. pronomial reference resohtiona r e  given in sentence sequences 1-4 below.1.

)It people sctually wrotelspoke in the style of the somewhatfacetious paraphrase of the original excerpt, the nominal referenceproblem would be reduced to one of matching lexcial patterns andrecognising a few syntactic cues; to state the obvious, the necessity formore* succinct linguistic communication has forced the development ofelliptical devices which shia  the burden of nominal reference resolutionfrom syntactic analysis to an analysis of the Hsemanticsll of sentencesin context.
More specifically, nominal references cannot in general beresolved without the use of general semantic infarmation a s  well asspecific world knowledge.While the fact that syntactic a-lysis alone i s  insufficient forunderstmding is  anything but novel, the question of the magnitude of thenominal reference problem and of its solution1 s crucial dependence uponlocal context seems to have been little commented upon.
(Clark (1975)discussee the problem from a viewpoint different from that of this paper, )The reader who remains unconvinced by the examples above thatlocal context (and specific world knowledge relating to local context)must play a crucial role in reference resolution i s  asked to consider thetwo sentence sequences 5a, 6, and 5b, 6.5. a.
The founding fathers had a difficult time agreeing on how thebasic laws governing our country should be framed.b.
Those foolish people a t  the country club have spent an incredibleamount of time arguing about club rules.6.
The second article of the constitution, for example, was arguedabout for months before agreement was reached.In sentence sequence 5a, 6, Itthe second articlett  clearly refers tothe second article of the constitution of the United States, while insentence sequence 5b, 6, the reference i s  to the second article of theconstitution of the country club.
In each case the only factor involvedin resolving the reference is the semantic content of i ts  10-1 aontext-in this case the meaning of the sentende preceding the one in which tkereference occurs.Since the lexical item Itthe constitutiontt appears in the examplejust considered, a word- concerning such proper-noun-like objects is inorder.

The advertising industry.In order for textual occurrm-ce of such proper-noun-like objects to beproperly handled, their standard default referents must be listed in thelexicon.
This is not to say that occurrences of proper-noun-like objectscannot be references to objects occurring previously in the text; rather-it is the case that their default options must also be considered a spossible referents.As  final examples of the reference resolution problem let  us  con-sider sentence sequences 9 and 10 below.9.

I tIn example 10 we have an instance of an  adverbial reference("thenf1) which must be recognized a s  referring to flyesterday" ratherthan bo some non adverbial object occurring in the f i r s t  sentence ofthat example,Sketch of a SolutionF r s m  the point of view of computer implementation, the problemof nominal reference resolution is one of creating tokens for nounobjects mentioned in a text, and discovering and encoding the relations,alluded to in the text, which hold between them and various other tokensin memory.This problem, though certainly not i t  s magnitude or  ramifications,was noticed by Rieger (1974) in his poineering implementation of aprimitive-based model of a natural language user.
Riegerls system,however, suffers from the incredible inefficiency r esuIting f rom its  needto search all  of memory in order to attempt any reference resolution;in addition it will often miss a quite obvious referent entirely, and, infact, resolves non-pronomial references only accidentally i f  at all.Before presenting a sketch of a proposed solution to the nominalreference resolution problem, it would be well to detail more preciselythe overall language processing enviornment within which it i s  meint  tooperate and of which it is a most necessary part.First,  we adsume that a relatively small set, S, of semanticprimitives and $ logical-calculus -like language, L, for expressingltmeaningsll a r e  available.
The set  S and language L must satisfy thefollowing two conditions.
(i) The predicate, function, and constant eymbols of L a r e  members ofS .
(ii) There is a one-to-o* mapping f rom meanings of (natural language)sentences to formulas of L.While a set of prki i t ives  and a meaning representation languageeven demonstably close to satisfying the above conditions have yet to beproduced, we will, in examples to follow, make use of meaning representations; the only claim we will make for them is that the functibnsserved by their constituent constructs must be served by the elementsof any adequate system.In addition to a meaning representation scheme we will assume enencoding of world knowledge of the sort  which a lltypicallt adult mightpossess, again with the same obvious caveat.While the question of translation from natural language sentence8to'meaning representations will not be touched upon here ,  we willsasume sentence -by- sentence translation of the sort  exhibited in variousexamples to follow.The solution  PO the reference resolution problem res ts  in recog-nizing the fact that reference is an elliptical device, and +that thehuman under stander of.
natural language cannot recapture that which waselided once he is too far from it in the text; in fact, he cannot resolvea reference to a p i n t  in the text more than a few-sentences back with-out going back and pondering i t  (if he can do so at all).
We should notethat this i s  true even ih the case in which the referent doesn'tactually appear in the text, but appears only in an inference f rom somestatement made in the text.
In this latter case - a case which we willdiscuss only a t  the very end of this paper the reference is not resolvable(and would not therefore have Been made by the c ~ e a t o r  of the text in thefirst place).
unless the statement from which the inference is madeappears shortly before in the text .
Though we cannot say preciselyhow far back i s  meant by.
"shortly before, " it is certainly no more thana few sentences.
Fbr a given sentence, S, appearing in a text we willrefer to the gequence of sentences preceding S by no more than theintended distance as the focus of S.In terms of computer implementation, we will, in the processing ofa text (which we conc-eive of as proceeding sentence-by-sentence),maintain the following focus sets.%bje CJ'(i) The noun-object focus - the set of tokens of a noun meaning re -presentation~ of the focus of S (where S is the bentence currently.being processed)(ii) The event focus - a  set aontaining, for every sentence W in thefocus of S, the object EVENT(F), where F i s  the meaninqrepresentation of W, and EVENT i s  a function which maps themeaning of a formula, F, into a noun-like object whose meaningis "the event (or fact) that F"(iii) The time focus - a set containing taken8 for all time references(e. g, yesterday, five olclock, etc. )
occurring in the meaninqrepresentation of the focus of S.The reader may question our inclusion of every object appearingin the meaning xepresentation of the focus of S in one of the above focussets, i. e. in the set  of potential referents.
In fact, however, it seemsto be the case that any object (of one of the above-mentioned types)occurring in the meaning representation of the focus of S may be thereferent of an object occurring later  in the meaning representation of S.Sonsidex, for example, the sentence sequences formed by taking each ofhe sentences af 12 below, - in turn - as an immediate continuation of a textzontaining sentence 1 1 below.11.

)The point i s ,  of course, that any item in (the meaning representa-tion of) a sentence, S, may be referenced by some item in (the mean-ing repr eeentation of) a latter sentence.On the other side of the coin the question of identifying potential re--ferences is just a s  important a s  that of identifying the seb of allpossible referents for an object which is known to reference something.If we were' concerned only with pronomial referenee reaolution, theproblem would have a simple solution; every pronoun is a reference.For  nominal items other than pronouns the problem is far less simple;if a noun occurs in a text just how do we know if there i s  a previouslyoccurring nominal item to which it refers?
As much a s  we would likethere to be algorithmically testable criteria, i. e. recognizable syntacticand/or semantic cues, for making the decision, there seem to be none.Thus, the mechanism we propose considers every token appearingin the translation of a sentence as a possible reference.At present, we hypothesize the existence of a small set, R, ofrelations which a re  suffvient to account for all  instances of nominalreference.
Included in this set a r e ,  a t  the very least, the relationsidentity, member of, subset of, and part of.
Noje that although thislist of relations im quite small, it suffices to handle all  the examples ofreference presented thus far (i. e. those occurring in sentence sequences1-6 and 9-12 as well as those occurring in the excerpted newpaperarticle above).Al l  of the above observations taken together lead to the followingsketch of an algorithm for reference resolution.I.
#AS each new sentence, S, is transrated into its meaning representation,the various focus sets (noun-object, event, time) a r e  updated.11.
A set, H, is formed containing all tuples of t&e form (N1, N2, P )  such'that N1 is a nominal item occurring in(the meaning representationof S, Nz is an object occurring in the focus set (noun-object,event, or time) appropriate to N1 , and i s  a member of R; His the set  of all current refewnce hypotheses arising-from S.III.
A lljudgment mechanism, " discussed below, is invoked to determinethe liklihoods of the correctness of the various members of H.It i s  clear that following step II any further processing of referencehypotheses requires that all members of H be considered relahive to oneavther, since the correctness or  incorrectness of one may dependcrucially upon that of others.
In the general case not all hypotheses willturn out to be correct, and in fact some may contradict o thers  - forinstance in the case of two hypothesis-triples with identical f i r s t  andsecond elements and different third elements.Once it  has been created, the set  H is submitted to a "judgmentmechanismft whose task it i s  to choose some of the hypotheses a s  validand others a s  invalid.
The judgement mechanism must clearly haveaccess to the world knowledge stored in memory, and must be capable ofperforming inferencing of a sort which produces decisions a s  to therelative Eklihoods of the various hypotheses.Before giving example8 of just how such a judgment mechanismmight work, we should make it clear that our sense of I1inferencing1l is verydifferent from Riegerls (1974).
In Riegerls sense inferencing is un-directed, while ours is directed toward the goal of val idat i~g hypotheses.There is, in addition, another sense in which the sor t  of inferencing tobe done by the judgment mechanism is directed.
The fact that the rgasonsfor validating or  throwing out a particular reference hypothesis (on thepart  of human natural language users) involve the information coweyed inlocal context as well a s  world knowledge relating to items contained inthat information (and world knowledge relating to items contained in worldknowledge relating to items contained in that information, ctc. )
constitutesa good guess as to the particular pieces of world kncrwledge and the rulesof inference which must be involved in judging that hypothesis.Ekamples of reference resolation14 and 15 below contain components of possible meaning repfeksentations of the two sentencel of sentence sequence 1 at the beginningof this paper.14.

Note that we arenot claiming that the predicates CHASED, and FALL INTO and the constantsYESTERDAY, BOY, DOG, PAST and DITCH a r e  a t  the leve3.
of semanticprimitives; rather, the above analyses a r e  at just the level which we needto illustate the operation of the reference resolution mechanism.
Further -more, the symbols YESTERDAY, BOY, DOG, PAST and DITCH ahouldbe taken a s  pointers to the definitions of the appropriate items encodedin memory in whatever fashion.
The brackethg in the notation [A], whereA is a pointer to a definition, is meant to be a function which takes Ainto an object whose meaning ie  the class of items satisfying the meaningpointed to by A.Once the translation of the f irs t  sentence of sequence 1 into itsmeaning representation has been completed - on the assumption that thatsentence is at the beginning of the text being processed - the variousfocus sem will contain the followkg:no.- object focus: [xl, xz) ; event fbcps.
: [(cfic21\~/\chcd\~~ ) 3  ;time focus [YESTERDAY ] .After the second sentence i s  translated the set, H, of reference -triple hypotheses presented to the judgment mechanism will then be thefollowing :i s  a member ofis a sqbget ofi s ~ p a r t  ofNote that no member of the event focus occurrs in H because thetranslation of the second sentence contains no term of the form EVENT(y); fors i m p l i c a e  omit the question of time referencing.All of the relations between y2 and xl or rt can be ruled outpn the basis of SUBSET (x,, [DOC]) SUBSET (xl.
[BOY]), MEMBEROr,, [DITCH]) and of the world knowledge to the effect that boysldogscannot be identical to, members of, eubsets of or parts of ditches (ofcourse in some weird fairy tale setting one of these might be possibleand shouldn't be thrown out; but in such a case local context wouldinform us of the "weirdrr situation and the appropriate one wouldn't bethrown out.
)The hypothesis that or  y3 i s  a part of either xl or xz can be20ruled out on the basis of SUBSET (q, [BOY]) and SUBSET (x,, [DOG]),which tell us that q and x2 a r e  sets  of objects, and the worldknowledge that sets  don't have "partsi1 in the sense of the "part of1!relation.Identify between yl and either XI or  x2 can be ruled out on thebasis of MEMBER (yl , y3) which tells us that yl i s  an ihdividual andSUBSET (x1, [BOY]), SUBSET (x2, [DOG]), GREATER (SIZE (x,), l),and GREATER (SIZE (xz), 11, which tell us that xl and x2 are setscontaining more than one object.
(Remember that we're not doingaxiomatic se t  theory in which there a r e  no lgindividuals in our senseand in which the sor t  of ll-iindividualll which is dealt with can be a subsetof some set.
)Fmally, the "member of" relation between y3 and either xl or x2can be ruled out pn the basie of MEMBER (yl, y3) which requires thpty3 be a set, SUBSET (xl, [BOY]), SUBSET (x ,  [DOG]), GREATER(SIZE (xl), I), and GREATER (SIZE (x2), 1), which tell  us that x1 and x2a r e  sets containing more thad one element each, and the fact that setsare not members of sets.
(Again, we're not dealing with set theory; ifin fact, we were - talking about axiomatic set  theory in English, thenlocal context would contain that information, and aiff erent inferenceswould come into play.
)This leaves us with the following hypotheses :is identical to' {is a subset o f j  [ : jy, is a member of { :gBut some of these hypotheses are consistent with one another: in factthe hypothesesi e  identical toX.
i = l , 21 is  a subset of-C 3imply the hypothesesyl is  a member of x. i = l , 21respectively because of MEMBER (yl, y,).
At any rate, the judgmentmechanism assumes at this point that either yl is a member of xl oryl i s  a member of x2.
The readear is asked to recall at this pointthat in presenting the usually preferred referents for references insentence sequences 1-4 the claim was made that in sentence sequence 1,the usually preferred referent for "onefr is  lfboys."
The reason for thisclaim is  the authort s observation.
that, when such a pronomial refercnceoccurs a s  the surface subject of a sentence, in the absence of semanticcontent which discrminates among the various possible referents, mostpeople seem to take the eurface subject of the last sentence in the focusa s  the inbnded referent.
The reason for this human judgment is probablythat the readerlhearer takes the surface subject to b e  the "topicll of asentence.
If this observation is correct, the judgment mechanism should,in the current example, simply choose "one of the boysr1 (yl is a memberof xl) as  the proper referent.
If this observation i s  incorrect, the judgmentmechaaism should judge that there is ambiguity in the reference 'loneSentence sequence 2 at  the beginning of this paper would be handledin precisely the same manner a s  sentence sequence 1 up to the point atwhich 11y3 is a member of xl1I and "y, i s  a member of x," were the r e -maining hypotheses.
The knowledge that Ifthe dogsLt refer red to sufferfrom a strange bone -weakening diaease would bhen cause the judgmentmechaniam to strengthen the likelihood that tlonell refers to "dogs, thuscausing Ityl is a member of x," to be the preferred judgment.Sentence sequence16 below contains an example of EVENT reference.16.
The presidnet was shot yesterday.
It caused a panic on Wall Street.Omitting all  other details of the translation into meaning representation wesimply note that the primitive -level predicate into which cause" is tranq-lated requires an object of the form EVENT (F) as its subject (i. e. if wesay something like "John caused a stir" what we mean is that John didsomething and the event (or fact) that he did that caused a stir.)
Thus,when the 2nd sentence is handled, the only possible referents for willbe the objects contained in the EVENT focus, namely just EVENT (thepresident was shot yesterrlay).
The judgment mechanism thus must s k p l ydecide if the event (or fact) that the president was shot yesterday was likelyto have caused a panic on Wall Street, a judgment which, with adequateworld knowledge, should certainly be confirmed.Sentence sequence 17 is a very similar case.17.
The president was shot yesterday.
Bill told me all about it.
Itcaused a panic on Wall Street.In order to resolve the reference 'lit" in the last sentence of 17, thejudgment mechanism would have to decide on the relative likelihoods ofi and ii below(i) The event (or fact) that the president was shot yesterday caused apanic on Wall Street.
(ii) The event (ok fact) that Bill told me about the president being shotyesterday cauaed a panic on Wall Street.Again, with the availability of reasonable world knowledge about suchthings a s  presidents, their being shot and panics, the judgment mechanismshould be able to choose the proper referent for "it1IWhile a fully detailed specification of the judgment mechanism mustawait further investigation, the above examples should illustrate, at leastin part, the manner in which we conceive of i ts  operation.ConclusionsThe phenomenon with which we have been dealing is one example ofwhat we would like to call the llcreativefl aspect of language use; morespecifically, reference of the sort  we have described - and attempted tohandle - is an elliptical device necessary for effective communication;moreover, it is a device which exhibits the ability of language to "changethe ground rulestf in a very flexible and fluid manner in response tocontext.At this point we must admit that there is an even more creativetype of reference than the sort we have dealt with.
18 below is anexample of this type of reference.18.
Last week I caught a cold while vieiting my mother in Chicago; asueual , the chicken eoup had too much pepper in it.The interesting reference in the above example i s  ILchickeh soup.
Therei s  no item in the first  sentence to which it is directly related; on theother hand, few people have any trouble resolving it by interpolatingbetween the two sentences of example 18 the idea expressed in sentence 19below:1,q.
When I get sick my mother makes me chicken soup.If sentence 19 were available, our reference resolution mechanism wouldeasily come up with an identity relation between the two occurrencesof I t  chicken eoup Obviously, for our proposed mechanism to resolvethis reference, some sort  of inferencing must f i rs t  work on the 1stsentence of 18 to produce the meaning of 19 a s  an inference.
Thus it isclear that reference resolution and general inferencing must be inter -leaved.The mechanism proposed abave does not handle the entire problem.It does, however, seem to be a minimal model of reference resoIdtion(minimal in the sense that at least this much must be going on).
Inaddition, it provides for that control over the use of general inferencingwhich is required to avoid a combinatbrial explosion (BOOM).ReferencesClark, H. H. (1975), I1Bridging1I, Conference on Theoretical Is sues inNatural Language Processing, 10 -13 June 1975, Cambridge, Mass.Rieger, C. J.

The method is meant t o  pnxrideinternal criteria for  inference cut-off.I.
IntroductionNatural language processing systems that  are sensitive t o  the semanticand logical content of processed sentences and to the p ~ g l r a t i c s  of t he i r  usegenerally draw inferences.
A set of fonmilas representing the meaning of asentence and the 'state of be l ie f t  of the system is augnented by other relatedformulas (the inferences) which are retrieved and/or constructed during thepmcessing.
The problem t o  be investigated here is: How can thi$ process becontmlled?
Can reasonable criteria be found fo r  restraining the addition ofinferences?Top-down inferences fol.luwing from the meaning of lexical items (oftenexpressed by decomposition into  primitives) are clearly bounded, i f  nointeractions are allowed amng the generated sub-formulas.
This process(which we call EXPANSION) w i l l  not be discussed here.
Rather, we shall beconcerned with SYNlESIS, i.e., the addition of new formulas based on the* This work was part ial ly suppored by NSF- Grant SCC 72-05465A01.

In particular, we are concerned with infererces addgd because a setcf beliefs is recognized as fitting a plre-defined pattern.The question we ask is: Given an initial set of beliefs ovm a set of;ri&ives, - w h a t  ' c r i t e~ ion  can be us& to M t  the pmcess of pattern matcljngr-d associated inference addition?
The major structural- feature t h a t  we use% w i d e  such a cri terion is a partial order over the set of patterns.Before pursuing th is  suggestion any further, let us examme sane d-3s a i t ~ ~ n a t i v e  ap-pmaches to infence and iiiCsrence c~r-off.To logicians, deductive inference involves rules by which fanmilas can3e added to a set (which k i ~ a l l y  cantains the d o n s )  in cer ta in  wayspv ided other formulas are dLready in the set.
In general, th i s  sort ofinfexence is quite open-ended in that one can keep applying the rules ofLnXerence and ccrme up w i t h  m r e  and a o ~ e  famulad dl of which represent'pvab le t  statements.

Theusual  solution has been to invoke the inferencer under the very strictcontrol of a supervising pgran w*&- has its own gmls progmnmd inw h i c h  mkes c-ain that appropriate criteria are applied to hdlt theinferenchg.

The notion we are trying t o  fcmnalize is''What does this set of beliefs suggest with respect t o  this se t  af patterns?
"The particular class of inferences we are concerned with are those gottenby matching beliefs i n  the input set against a pattern and augmenting thebeliefs with additional p p o s i t i o n s  as dictated by the pattern.

One additional technicalpoint should be made: It often happens that  fo r  a given input se t  there areno single patt- instances which cover a l l  the inputs, though patterns-exist m s e  instances cover subsets of the inputs.
In such a case we usean extended SYNTHFLSIZE operationt~hich is defined in the same sp i r i t  a sSYWHESIZE.
(See (R,75).
)Even w i t b u t  the firU f d  treatment, several things should now beclear.
First ,  the actual nunibex of inferences dra.. (propositions added) fora particular input set may be small o r  large (depending on the inputs andthe pattern set,) but it is bounded in a p h c i p l e d  way because of thedefinitim of SYNTHESIZE.Second, the usual distinction between 'antecedent' and 'consequent'clauses in the pattern is not h t a i n e d ;  a clause in the pattern may serveas an antecedent on one occasion and a consequent on ano-Eher.Third, if 'defined1 lexical item were t o  be associated w i t h  tht:patterns, noting which variables are to be bound as arguments uponinstantiation, then the SYN'IIESIZE function can be used to canpute sumnarizhgexpressions.

Note, however, that the roles of(1) (GIVE RAM( 1000-DOLLARS JOHNDOE)and (2) (INTEND JOHMXlE (RFIURN JOHNDOE 1000-DOLLARS BANK))have been reversed.
In Situation 2, (1) was an input and ( 2 ) was infemed ,whereas in Situation 3, (2) was input wd (1) inferred.
The currespondingclauses of the loan pattke2*n were serving as antecedents on one occasion andconsequents on the other.
This follows naturKLly fran the way SYNIPIESIZE wasdefined.In this regard the reader rnay notice that sane input belief sets mightyield 'warrantedt or 'spu~?ious' inferences--jumping to too many cmclusicms.Hawever, the incmmntal addition of new patterns corrects this anom19 in anatural way: Patterns which formerly were 'least covers' may cease to be so inthe extended pattern set.V .
Using Definitions to Set  -Up the Pgt tem SpaceWe have been particularly interested in using definitions of wordsto set up pattern spaces in which SYNTHESIZE could wark as an inferencerand a lexical insertion technique.
Special attention was payed t o  the 'speechactv verbs, and a bief sample list is presented below.
(The symbol '?Prtdenotes a predicate variable.
Also, primitive predicates are capitalized,while defined predicates are underlined. )
Again, the definitions are greatlyoversimplified for i l lustrative purposes.
(define - tell  (?x ?y ?p ?t)(and (-RE ?

The outputof t h i s  routine consists  of a l i s t i n g  of t h e  input, with e r ro r  comments wherenecessary, together with the  in ternal  representation of the  va l id  t r ee s  whichis wri t ten onto a f i l e  - the  parse-tree f i l e  - f o r  the  subsequent analyses.several other f i l e s  are used i n  addition t o  the parse t r e e  f i l e .There is the  informant f i l e  which contains p rof i l es  of the informants,(e.g.
age, sex, l i ngu i s t i c  background, e t c ) ,  a s e t  o f  form class  files and as e t  of c lass i f ica t ion files.
The form class  files are groupings of thevarious keywords which may occur i n  the data.
Thus, f o r  example, one formclass f i l e  contains a l l  keywords which may occur on the left-hand s ide  of arewrite.
A class i f ica t ion file contains a group number f o r  each informant;for  example, one c lass i f ica t ion f i l e  contains 0 f o r  each informant not aged 51 i f  the  informant is  aged 5 with a Hindi l ingu is t i c  background and 2otherwise: In any operation on the data  the utterances of informants i ngroup 0 of the relevant c lass i f ica t ion w i l l  be ignored.Each node of a t r e e  i n  the parse t r ee  f i l e  consists of a name - i n  thecase of a rewrite t h i s  is the left-hand s ide  of the rewrite,  otherwise it isthe level number - and a s e t  of descriptors, e .g.
the grammar associated withthe name.
Thus, i n  the example of Figure 1, the l ines 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.1.2,1.1.2.1 become the sub-tree of Figure 2 where the descriptors are  put i nparentheses.Figure 2SUBJPRMD (PADJ, ST, SG, OK) HDW (ANIM, NOK; IAE: NEQV)I INCO ASOCFor any t ree ,  each analysis s t a r t s  a t  the root and many of the taskst o  be described below may be regarded, i n  par t ,  as a pat tern  matchingexercise.
The d i f f i cu l t i e s ,  and in t e re s t ,  a r i s e  because each node of theparse t r e e  carr ies  a substant ial  amount of information, and except forl i t e r a l s ,  only a p a r t i a l  matching of the nodes is usually required.
Inaddition, some tasks requira the matching of d i s jo in t  sub-trees within a givenparse t r ee ,  occasionally subject t o  s ide  conditions which may involve nodesnot lying on the paths between the  root and any of the  sub-trees of i n t e r e s t .Apart from the pat tern matching,there is the problem of c lass i f i ca t ion  of theoccurrences of the  various patterns.
This is a simple tabulation complicated,i n  some cases, by the f a c t  tha t  the t o t a l  number of categories i s  unknown.The bas ic  task of the  system may be cas t  i n  the form: count withrespect t o  a given c lass i f i ca t ion  f i l e ,  and subject t o  s t a t ed  s ide  conditions,the occurrences of a given pattern.Since there are only 1,000 informants and they f a l l  i n to  a reasonablysmall nunher of classes it is economical t o  pre-classify on the bas i s  of theinformant prof i les  ra ther  than bui ld  the c lass i f i ca t ion  process i n t o  the  r e s tof the  analysis.
The system is instructed t o  produce a c lass i f i ca t ion  f i l eby a statement of the  form:CLASS = ( class i f ica t ion  f i l e  name ) , (4 expression l i s t  >) where(classif icat ion f i l e  name) is  the name by which the f i l e  w i l l  be known,and each expression in<eqress ion  l i s t  7 i s  a Boolean expression.

These programsinclude facilities for compiling information such asfrequency of occurrence of strings (e.g.
word frequencies)or substrings (e.g.
consonant cluster frequencies), anddescribing relationships among strings (e.g.
various phono-logical realizations af a word).
Also, an associative database may be interactively accessed on the basis of keyscorresponding to different types of data elements, and apattern matcher allows retrieval of incompletely specifiedelements.
Applications Of this natural language processingpackage include analysis of phonological variation for speci-fying and testing phonological rules, and comparison acrosslanguages for historical reconstruction.f ,  NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING PACKAGEA.
General characteristicsThe natural language processing package implemented atthe Speech Communications Research Laboratoqy (SCIU;) iscurrently w e d  in the analysis of associated lists @f stringdata such as discourse transcriptions or pronouncing diction-aries.
The package consists ofa) a set of "batchw programs which provide frequencyand context information on the lexical and phonological formsappearing in the input; andb) a system for interactively accessing the data dn thebasis of orthographic and phonological patterns.All of the programs in this package are written in SAIL,an ALGOL-based language offering extended string and setmanipulation operations and an associative data base.
Theprograms run on a DEC PDP-10 at Carnegie-Mellon Universityvia the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) computernetwork (ARPANET).
The ARPANET is accessed by the ELI?
oper-ating system developed by SCRL, which runs on a local PDP-11 [I].While the processing package is applicable to varioustypes of natural language data, it has been used most exten-sively at SCRL in the analysis of discourse transcriptions.The discourses consist of conversational speech gathered ininterviews with adult speakers of various dialects of AmericanEnglish.
More than twenty-five discourses, transcribed ortho-graphically and phonologically, have been prmssed, yieldingdetailed information on over 28,000 utterances representingabout 3,500 distinct lexical- items.
All examples in thissection are taken from a typical discburse.B.
"Batchw FacilityDiscourse processing usually begins with the generationof a transcription reference file in which orthographic andphonological representations are listed in discourse order,as illustrated in Figure 1.WELLLET ' STRYCLASSIFYINGTHEMACCORDING=TOTHEEXCUSES086 TRAY887 KLAES$CFAYIHNS888 DHAXM88s //AXK$ORDIHN/TUW//Figure 1In this example, the phonological realization of TRYis /tray/ (coded TRAY).
The phonological code shown is abasic ARPA phonemic alphabet augmented by special symbolsindicatim some phonetic detail, such as vowel height.
Therealization of THE, for example, is coded DH$I, indicatingthat the vowel fell between /i/ and / I / .Reference number's assigned to each utterance serve as anindex to the discourse context in which utterances occur, andare used to interpret the output of other programs in thepackage.
Separate reference number sequences are provided forthe orthographic and phonological forms in the reference files,since there may not be a one-to-one correspondence betweenthese forms, as in the case of phonological merging whl-ehobscures word boundaries, In Figure 1, for example, the twoorthographic items WELL and LET'S are realized as a singlephonological item /wl E ts/ (coded WELEHTS)The core of the "batch!
processing facility is a set ofthree programs: PROCON, ENVIRN and CLUSTR.
PROCON providesfrequency and context information on the lexical level, whilethe other two provide similaf information on the phonologicallevel,PROCON output contains an alphabetically sorted list ofthe utterance types occurring in the input discourse trans-cription file as illustrated in Figure 2.
Frequency of oc-currence of each type is given, along with the various phono-logical realizations.
For each phonological realization,frequency count and reference numbers are provided.8 HAVE 3 AXV 11,337,7033 HHAEI 354,828,13971 HHAXh 7101 HH$GV 1067Figure 2In Figure 2, for example, HAVE occurred eight times, andwas pronounced (/av/) three times and HHAEV v threetimes.
Using the reference numbers associated with these pro-nunciations, it is possible to establish the discourse context.One would f i n d  that the tbree AXV pronunciations (i.e.utterances 11, 337 and 703) a l l  involved the auxiliaryconstruction in ",.,may have felt,,,seemed to have beenwhich have since been.
.. IIENVIRN tallies occurrences of phonological segments andenvironments in the discourse transcriptions.
The output ofthis program lists frequencies of all phonemes appearing in&he input file, as illustrated in Figure 3.Figure 3Glottal stop, coded Q, occurred a total of thirty timesin the discourse, The immediate environments of Q are l i s t e dalphabetically by left context, with word boundaries indicatedby slash /, and a frequency count and reference numbers aregiven for each environment.
For example, Q appeared eighttimes in the context EH--EN ( E - n ,  and a check of thereference list shows that all these occurrences were in theword sentence (s) .ENVIRN output also provides a frequency ordered l i S t  ofphonemes, w i t h  frequency totals brokerr down according t ooccurrence in word i n i t i a l ,  medial and final position.CLUSTR, the third of the "batch" programs,is used i n  theanalysis of phoneme c lus ter  distribution i n  the discourse data.A l l  c lusters  are indexed by each of their component phonemes,so that the cluster NDZ (fndz)') which is  listed under D i nFigure 4 also appears under N a d  2 i n  the  full output.D E N T S  1 699D Q E N T S  1 486D V 2 1 4 1 7 ,  1445D Z 5 278, 284, 837, 1341,  1350N D Z  1 1429Figure 4Separate output may be generated for clusters occurring withinwoxds or across word boundaries- Currently, consonant andvawel clusters are tallied, but the program can be easilymodified to handle sequences of phonemes belonging to arbi-trary user-defined classes (e.g.
voiced sounds,, nasals, un-voiced stops, etc. )
.For each phoneme belonging to a selected class, CLUSTRprovides a count of the number of times that the phoneme appearsin clusters, an alphabetically sorted list of those clusters,and a frequency count and reference numbers for each cluster.Figure 4, a sample of CLUSTR output for within-word consonantclusters, shows that D appeared in clusters a total of 70 times,with 32 of these being ND clusters.
Reference numbers may beused to establish the discourse context of any cluster.
Forexample, the cluster D Q EN T S (/di?nts/) appears in utterance486 which is the word students.
Like ENVIRN, CLUSTR providesa frequency ordered list of cluster types in addition ts thealphabetic list.C- Interactive Retrieval FacilityThe set of "batch" programs is complemented by a languagedata retrieval system which allows the user to interactivelyretrieve data items conforming to various orthographic, phono-logical and syntactic patterns.Linguistic data is inte~nally stored in the system as anetwork of associations between items of various types.
Theseassociations are implemented in SAIL as LEAP triples [2J andthe element types entering into these associations vary accord-ing to the - particular application.
For example, in analysisof the discourse data described above, triples contain ortho-graphic, phonological and syntactic elements.
For study ofphonetic-to-phonemic mapping, triples might be orthographic,phonemic and phonetic elements.
In comparative linguisticresearch, triples might consist of an orthographic elementand two phonological elements corresponding to two languagesor dialectsData can be accessed on the basis of patterns directed toany one (or any combination) of these elements.
For example,if the data base contains associations between orthographic,phonological and syntactic elements, then the queryP/ 0: THEretrieves the phonological items associated with the .spellingTHE, and might return DHAX(/Ba/ )  and DHIY i ) .
The queryO/ P: TUWwould retprn the orthographic items pronounced T m  (/tu/), e.gtwo, too, t o r- - -Patterns such as THE and TUW completely specify theelement to which they are directed, but various special formsallow partial.
specifications to be expressed also.
The symbol$ matches any single segment (in a phonological pattern) orcharacter (in an orthographic pattern), and the symbol =matches any number, llncluding zero, of contiguous segments(or characters).
Thus, if N is the syntactic code for Nounrthe queryO/ P: $$, S: N, 0: D=searches for all two-phoneme nouns which begin with the letterD, and might return dye, day, - doe, dough.Each phonological element is defined in terms of a set offeatures such as UV (unvoiced) and ST (stop), and thesefeatures may be used to specify segments in phonologicalpawerns.
To search for phonological realizations containing/i/ between unvoiced stops, one could use the queryP/ P: =(UV + ST)IY(UV + ST)=to find /kip/ (keep) , /pik~ ?/  (peeking) , and /r  pit d/ (repeated)Boolean operators are also available for specifyingpattern segments.
For example, the query0 6: (C OR K)=, P: (NOT K)=returns arthographic ikems which begin with C or K and are notpronounced with initial k ,  e.g.
cite, change, know.Several capabilities lacking in the current interactivesystem will be available in the near future.
The user will beable to (1) specify optional segments and sequences of segmentsin phonological patterns; (2) create and name sets containingitems of interest, e.g.
monosyllabic function words, and useset operations such as union and intersection; (3) interactive-ly modify feature definitions of phonological symbols: (4) re-trieve several elements, e.g.
orthographic and phonologicalforms, simultaneously; (5) display the discourse context of anygiven item, and (6) write retrieval queries and responses to afile for subsequent analysis.11.
APPLICATIONSThe processing package can be used in the analysis ofvarious kihds of natural language data, as illustrated in thefollowing examples.A.
Phonological variationThe programs can be used to efficiently index and sortnatural language data so that systematic phonological varia-tion can be easily examined.
For example, inspection of aPROCON output for a ten minute interview consisting of over2,000 utterance tokeno yields general observations such as-- final /t/ alternates with final glottal stop /?/ undercertain conditions;-- alveolar flapping occurs under several stressconditions whidh appear to be related to noun affixes.These preliminary observations can be systematicallyinvestigated using the interactive query system.The data base can be queried for all phonological realiza-tions ending in T (/t/) or Q ( /?
/ ) ,  and the corresponding ortho-graphic entries, using the queriesP/ P: =(T OR Q )  and O/ P: =(T OR 9 )The resulting list might includeart /a*/but /bat /can' t /k=nt//k en?/fished /f 1 J t /limitraftthatwantThat is, final /t/ appears to vary with final /?
/  followingvowels arid following nasals, but not elgewhere.
This hy-pothesis, represented as a context-sensitive phonologicalrule, could then be tested against additional data using anyof several computer rule testers [3-51.Forthcoming modifications will allow queries with setoperations, such that the intersection of orthographic entries-having final /t/ alternating with /?/ can be requested directlyby the query01 P: =T n P: =Q .That is, only entrieq with /t/ and /?/ alternation would beretrieved, and the entties art, fished and raft would not bereturned,In order to determine the conditions under which alveolarflapping occurs, the queriesO/ P: =DX= and P/ P: =DX=can be used to retrieve phonological items which contain DX( )  and correspondihg orthographic items.
Such a list mightincludeability l a b  il xfi/city /s ifid/facility /f as il  IF^/letter /l ;fa/petty /p ;pi/responsibility / r ~ s p a n s ~ b i l ~ ~ i /writing /rd~f I g /Flapping occprs in a descending stress pattern, e.g.
cityletter, petty, wrdting in which a stressed vowel precedesthe flap and an unstressed vowel follows.
In addition, trheflap appears to occur between unstressed vowels when thesequence rppresents the noun asfix -ity, as in ability.
Tocheck this, the queryP/ 0: =ITY, S: Ncould be used to retrieve a81 nouns ending in -ity, and thesubset involving affixed forms ( i .
e .
excluding city, pity)could be examined for occurrences of flapping.B.
Word Error Recognition testingThe interactive facility can be used to examine the kindsof word recognition errors which might occur in a speech under-standing system due to indeterminacies in segment labelling.If a string is completely specified as /likrg/(coded LIYKIHNX),then it matches a single word, leaking.
However, if labellingis less precise, then alternative (and incorrect)word matchesmight occur.
Using the inte~ctive retrieval system, alter-native labels and resulting word matches can be examined forany given lexicon.In the example above, the labelled string might beL (VOC HIGH ANT) K I H  NXwith the stressed vowel represented as a set of features:vocalic, high, anterior.
Resulting word matches might includeleaking and licking.If the initial consonant is also specified as a set offeatures (consonant, sonorant, continuant), as i n  the string*(CON SON CONT) {VOC H I G H  ANT) K IH NXthen the resulting word matches might be leaking, l i c k i n q ,reeking.
If the K is specified less precisely as $ voice-less stop, word matches might include leakinq, licking,reeking, leaping, rippinq.The interactive facility allows the system designer toeasily determine the nature of possible incorrect matchesdue to phonological indeterminacy, especially as the size ofthe lexison increases.C.
Comparative Linguistic RelationshipsIf the data base is represented as an orthographic listwith two associated phonological lists representing twolanguages or dialects, the interactive system can be used todiscover systematic sound correspondences, and to aid in thestudy of dialect relationships and historical reconstruction.A sample'data base might be:Glossa fishto haveno, notbrotherbambooLanquaqe A Lanquage Bplaa Pami i miaplaaw Pawphii fiaphaay fayThe querywould retrieve those items in language B which correspond toitems in language A with initial /pl-/ clusters, e.g.
andpaw, indicating that consonant cluster simplification may haveoccurred in language B.
The queryB/ A: =IYIYwould retrieve those items in language B which correspond toitems in language A with final /-ii/, e.g.
the drphthongizedmia and f ia.- -A large data base could be accessed in this way to dis-cover systematic correspondences between languages A and B,such as the correspondences /pl-/:/p-/, m : m ,  /ph-/:/f/,i i : i a  a a : a ,  etc.The flexibility of the interactive system, combined withthe linguistic intuition of the user, can be used.to specifyand retrieve any set of correspondences, without the need toformat the data according to initial consonants or clusters,vowel nuclei, finals, etc.
Information such as tonal cnntoursand stress can also be represented and accessed.REFERENCES[I] Retz, D. La, 3.

Discrimination valueanalysis assigns an appropriate role in the indexing operation tothe single terms, term phrases, and thesaurus categories.
Toenhance precision i t  is useful to form phrases from high-frequencysingle term components.
To improve recall, low-frequency termsshould be grouped into affinity classes, assigned as contentidentifiers instead of the single terms.Collections in different subj ect areas are used in experimentsto characterize the type of phrase an8 word class most effectivefor content representation.The following typical conclusions can be reached:a) the addition of phrases improves performance considerably;b) use of phrases is better with corresponding deletion ofsingle terms in practically all cases;c) the use of both high-frequency and medium-frequencyphrases is generally more effective than the use of either phrase-type alone;d) the most effective thesaurus categories are those whichinclude a large number of low-frequency terms;e) the least effective classes either consist of only one ortwo terms, or else they include terms w i ~ h  unequal frequency cha-racteristics permitting the high-frequency terms to overcome theothers.The discrimination value theagr is developed and appropriateexperimental output is supplied.American Journal of Computational Linguistics Microfiche 36 : 68D e p a r t q e n t  o f  ~ n t h r o p o l o g yU n i v e r s i t y  of New BrunswickRoswe l l  Park Memorial X n s t i  t u t gB u f f a l o ,  New YorkL i n g u i s t i c  S t r i n g  P r o j e c tNew York University2 Washington Sqyare V i l l a g e r  28New York, New Yofk 10012ABSTRACT~inguistic mechanisms of compression are used when making notes within acontext where the objects and meanings are known.
Mechanisms of compressidn inmedical records for a collaborative study of breast cancer are described.
Thesyntactic devices were mainly deletion of words having a special status in thegrammar of the whole language and deletion in particular positions of word+having a special sta&us in the sublanguage.
The deIeted forms are describedand sublanguage Qord classes defined.
A subcorpus of the medical records wasparsed by an existing computer parsing system; a component covering the dele-tion-forms was added to the granunar.
Modifications to t,he computer grammarare discussed and the parsing results are summarized.IntroductionAll 1anguages"have mechanisms of compression.
Sentences may be embeddedwithin other sentenaes by means of nominalization and complementation.
Variousgrammatical transformations involve deletion of certain parts of the sentence.In medical records, we find entries such as no evidence of metastases, whichmay be said to be derived Trea something like There is no evidence of metastases.Such incomplete sentences are not common in the spoken language of the medicalrecords (i.e.
dictated reports).
However when physiciakrs themselves are requirbdto write- material for records, compression mechanisms are qmmonly use&.Although this paper will deal with a m i f i c  corpus, similar devices wouldIoften be used for compression in other s-ations where there is pressure towrite as little as possible, Legal, educational, and scientific recordg whereinformal notes are kept woum be other examples of this class of sitqations.The original motivation for this study was to develop effective methods forstoring &e information in a medical record and to be able to retrieve this in-formation for purposes of research, medical care, or administration.
Fsoan pre-vious research, the feasibility of verbatim input of dictated narrative has beenestablished, Computerized extraction of the information has been shown to befeaeible i~ a test system ACORN (Automated Coding of Report ~arrative).hissystem has been described in detail in a series of previous papers.

1303-1307.Source of MaterialThe medical&es discussed here are ffom tjhe records of the  SurgicalAdjutrant Breast Project,  a nationwide collaborative study involving 36 medicalins t i tu t ions .
The records were f i l l e d  ou t  by medical and paramedical personnela t  the par t ic ipat ing in s t i t u t ions  and cehtralized a t  Ro$glell Park Nemri&lI n s t i t u t e  i n  a S t a t i s t i c a l  un i t  under thq direction\of-Dr. Nelson S-lack.
Asample of approximately 50 w a s  taken from the 2734 cage h i s t o r i e s  of pa t ien tsi n  the program and is being used i n  the l b g u i s t i c  analysis.
Each case his toryordinari ly consiats df 3-6 pages of deta i led  information on the pa t i en t ' s  i n i -t i a l  s ta tus ,  treatment, pathology report,  nledicai problems, and subsequentfate .
When the structured information i n  the  record was excluded, each casehistory had between 6 and 26 notated items, each item consisting of 1 t6 5 par-t ia l -sentences .
While this material is speckalized t o  me purposes of the col-laborative study, t h i s  type of information i q  f a i r l y  typ ica l  of what is foundi n  the usual hospital  record.The notes were typed v e x b a t h  using An IBM Mag Card Communicator so as t oobtain simultaneously a typed paper document and a record i n  computer-usableform.
This device is used i n  the  data-input sgstem of T~CES;  an exist ing systemfo r  handling completely s tructured records.
It would presumably be usea i n  anyextension of TICES which would handle medical nates.
I n  e i s ' a n a l y s i s  the com-puter  w a s  used t o  reorganize the material  i n  a fbrmmore convenient fo r  manualanalysis by the l inguis t .Anderson analyzed the l i ngu i s t i c  s t ruc ture  of the en t r i e s  i n  a sample ofthe  medical records involving radiation findings, A discussion of t h i s  ana-l y s i s  w i l l  take up the next part of the paper.
Sager and associates used someof the findings from this study to  develop methods fo r  processing these samemedical records by computef, adapting% program and grananar which had beendeveloped fok parsing science a r t i c l e s .
This p ro jec t  w i l l  be discussed i n  thef i n a l  part of the  paper.Linguist ic  Character is t ics  of Medical NotesMany o f  the e n t r i e s  on the  medical records a r e  i n  the  form of notes whicha r e  ne i ther  complete sentences nor s ing l e  word e n t r i e s ,  but  l i n g u i s t i c  stringsof a n  intermediate type, which we w i l l  he rea f te r  c a l l  fragments, Fragments a r ea compressed t y p  of l i n g u i s t i c  material resu l t ing  from various transformationswhich have the e f f e c t  of making l i n g u i s t i c  s t r i ngs  shor te r  by reducing or de-l e t i n g  materihl.
The writer of these  stretches of mater ia l  must make h i s  en-tries brief, i n  order t o  save time and e f f o r t ,  but  a l s o  make them informativeand unambiguous.
For t h i s  reason the deleted material has t o  be eas i l y  recover-able, o r  i n  other  words it must not  contain much information.
An analys is  ofthe  fragments shows t h a t  de le t ion  is maiinly of a small c l a s s  of sentence parts:(1) tense and the verb - be (t - be ) ;  (2) subjec t ,  tense and t h e  verb - be; (3) t hesubject; and (4) subject ,  tense,  and verb (V) other  than - be.A second cha rac t e r i s t i c  of fragments which makes deleted mater ia l  recover-ab le  is that both t h e  meted  material and the remainders consis t  of words i neasily defined subclasses,  based on both d i s t r i bu t iona l  and semantic c r i t e r i a .These subclasses are eas i l y  defined because of t he  nature of the  sublanguage;i n  general the  vocabulary is l imited and each word has a l imi ted  semantic range.The question on a form khich is being answered can a l s o  be used a s  a basis f o rre to r ing  deleted material.One of the most commonly deleted items i n  the medical records is t - be (1and 2) .
Tense is perhaps t he  most important information - be gives.
The dele t ionof tense i n  the medical records causes no ambiguity because usually the physiciandescribes the  s i t u a t i o n  a t  the time of f i l l i n g  ou t  the report, O t h e r w i s e  hegives the time i n  a t i m e  phrase: x-rays on November 2.Fragment TypesIn  Table 1 w e  l ist  the fragment types, giving an example of each, but notwith a l l  occurring word subcl&!3ses.
The types w i l l  S i r s t  be given according t owhat material is deleted and then w i l l  be fu t ther  subclassed according t o  thehighest nodes of the t r e e  s t ructure  of the remainder.

Due t o  the nature of the sub-language there  is r e l a t ive ly  l i t t l e  overlap (e.g., a given verb is l i k e l y  t otake only one noun subclass as s h j e c t )  compared t o  what w e  would f ind  i n  thelanguage as a whole.Two impoftant subclasses of h-n nouns used i n  the  medical records areN-physician and N-patieht.
Each has only a few members, but is important becausemany verbs c h q a c t e r i s t i c a l l y  take it as subject  o r  object ,  and a l s o  becauseboth, but par t icu la r ly  N-physician, are usually deleted.
It is on the basis ofthe verbs which charac te r i s t i ca l ly  take  them as subject  o r  object  t h a t  they canusually be recovered without ambiguity.Other noun subclasses concern more d i rec t ly  the  subject  matter of the  re-ports, the concrete objects  with which the  physician is  dealing.
Unlike N-physician and N-patient, these classes usually have many mmbers and they a r eseldom deleted.

Proceedings of t he  NCC, AFIPS Press, Montvale; N. 3. , 1973.The LSP grqmmar of English is based on the same linguistic principles as theACORN grammar.
Hence it could also serve to test the feasibility of adding anote-handling capability to the ACORN-TICES system.
The LSY sylr which wasdesigned for text-processinQ, was adapted to the parsing of medical records bydeleting portions of the grammar which are not required for this type of ma-terial and adding a section covering sentence fragments.
These change$ aredescribed below, followed by the parsing resultb.The corpus which was parsed consisted of 12 sections of the RadiationFindings extracted in their order of appearance from the medical records.
Thesesections contained 245 sentences or sentence fragments (word sequences endingin a period).
Of these, 37 were complete English sentences and 205 were frag-ments; 3 were combinations of both types.
21 entries were identical to othersin the corpus, accounting in all for 139 of the sentences ox sentence fragments.Of the complete sentences, same were quite long, e.g., Reexamination shows somescarring and thickening over the right apex which is perhaps slightly more evi-dent than it was before, but nothing is seen that is typical of tumor involvement.Typical sxorter sentences are Chest films on 10-25-68 and 12-14-68 do not showany essential changes since- last reports, Liver scan 1-29-69 was normal.
Frag-ments were, as predicted, of the types listed in Table 1, above, though not alltyMs were represent-ed in the parsed corpus.Table 3 shows the new definitions or redefinitioqd which were added to theLSP grammar to cover fragments.
These definitions are written in ~ahs-Naur Form(BNF), as ilze all the ca.
180 definitions which comprise the context-free-partof the LSP English grammar.
The BNF definitions are used by the parser to con-struct a tree representing the structure of the input sentence.In addition to BNF definitions, the grammar contains restrictions, whichtest the sentence trees for grammatical and selectional well-formedness.

In the case of medical records, the unit may be.longer than one sentence, but we have retained the root-word SENTENCE and de-fined SENTENCE in this case to be a TEXTLET (definition 2 ) ,  ,which.consists of asentence (called OLD-SENTENCE, definition 3) optionally followed by more sdn-tences (MORESENT, definition 4).
The definition of OLD-SENTENCE has the samethree elements (INTRODUCER, CENTER, ENDMARK) that the definition of SENTENCEdoes in the LSP grammar; however, in this case, tho INTRODUCER (definiqion 5) isNULL; the CENTER (definition 6) contains an option FRAGMENT in addition to theoptions ASSERTION and IMPERATIVE defined in the English grammar; (other~optionsof CENTER, e.g.
QUESTION, have been deleted); and the ENDMARK (definition 10)contains unconventional punctuation, such as dashes and cornma, in addition tothe period and semicolon.
Since our main interest here is in FRAGMENT (defini-tion 7), we will elaborate onlhis definition.R.
Grishman, "The Restrictton Language for Computer Grammars of TFatural Language'Commun.
of the ACM, 18, 390-400, 1975, and the references cited there.I n  defining FRAGMENT, we have used parts of the  grammar which were definedindependently of the  fragment problem.
That t h i s  is poss ib le  is i n  i t s e l f  ap a r t i a l  v e r i f i c a t i a n  of t he  conclusion from manual analys is  t h a t  only l imited,grammatically speci f iable ,  deletion-forms occur i n  the  fragments seen i n  notesand records.
For example, the dropping of the  verb (type 1 of Table 1) canoccur i n  normal English when a sentence containing the  verb - be occurs as theobjec t  of a verb l i k e  - f ind ,  e.g.
We found the  chest  c l e a r  t o  pekcussion andauscul tat ion.
itn the U P  grammar the re  is an objec t  s t r i n g  defined f o r  such oc-currences; it is calleg SOBJBE (Subject - + Object of - be).
This same s t r i n g  canthen be made an option of CENTER t o  analyze fragments having the same ?
o m  e,g.Cheet c l ea r  to.percussion and auscul tat ion.In  detail, the de f in i t i on  of FRAGMENT begins with t h e  element SA (Sentence -Adjunct).
The defini t ion '  of SA (not shown here)  contaihs 16 options covering a l l-types of sentence modifiers* In  t h i s  material the  most frequent SA is a t h eexpzession, usually a da te  [called PDATE, f o r  opt ional  Preposit ion + date) o rth is  examination, t h i s  v i s i t .
Following SA i n  the  de f in i t i on  FRAGMENT are theoptions proper, naming de f in i t i ons  already i n  t h e  LSP grammar.
The f i r s t  optionSOBJBESHOW (Subject - + O b j  ect of - be o r  - show), corresponds t o  t h e  second and t h i r ds t ruc tures  of type 1 and a l s o  occurrences l i k e  Chest f i l m  no change, which is  anexpansion of SOBJBE, discussed above.
This option covers dele t ions  of t he  twomost common verbs i n  this material, - be and - show.
The plade of - be o r  - show (defi-n i t i on  8) i n  a fragment is e i t h e r  empty or is f i l l e d  by a dash.The mkond and four th  options,  ASTG and VENPASS, i n  FRAGMENT correspond t os t ruc tures  of type 2 i n  Table 1 (e.g., Negative_, f e l t  t o  be a benign l e s ion ) ,where t h e  subjec t ,  tense  and verb - be have been dropped.
I n  t he  LSP grammar, ASTG(Adjective - - s t r i n d  is an option of OBJBE, and VEWASS (V-en  passive s t r i n g )  i sa l s o  permitted a f t e r  -C be and i n  other  places.
The thitd option, NSTG Noun -s t r i n d ,  is an objec t  of show e .
g .
,  Mild degenerative chanqes (?$om, X-rays show- -'mild*degenerative changes).
I t  ale0 covers occurrences of t h e  first s t r u c t u r e  oftype 1 (e.g.
No X-rays taken) where fo r  regu la r i ty  with more complete e n t r i e s  thepassive Verb (taken) is seen as a r i g h t  adjunct  of the  noun.
The last  opt ion,consisting of NSTG followed by e i t h e r  ASSERTION o r  SOBJBESHOW, covers such oc-currences as PA and l a t e r a l  ches t  1l,-5-71 reexamination shows some scar r ing  andthickening over the  r i g h t  apex.
where a noun phrase (PA and' lateral  ches t  11-5-71) precedes an asse r t ion  about t h a t  ngun phrase.-Space permits only a few remarks about these def in i t ions .
It was helpfult o  order t he  options so t h a t  the longer opt ions precede t h e  sho r t e r  ones, s incesome of the shor te r  options (e.g., NSTG) can have the  &form a s  t he  f i r s telement of t he  longer ones.
This is not  required i n  parsing t e x t s ,  s ince  i n  f u l ls e n t h c e s  the re  is usually no other  way of f i t t i n g  i n  t he  remainder of t he  sen-tence.
Also, i n  t e x t  sentences, many nouns requ i re  a preceding determiner, s ot h a t  compound nouns are no t  s p l i t  i n t o  separa te  noun phrases.
In  t h i s  mater ia l ,determiners are ra re ly  emplbyed, so  t h i s  cons t ra in t  cannot be applied.T h i ~ ,  combined wim verb dele t ions  and t h e  use of commas both i n  t he  t e x t  and assentence sepamtors ,  makes fof a g rea t  dea l  of syn tac t ic  ambiguity.
However, asthe next sec t ion  shows, it was possible  t o  obta in  the  intended parse  as t h efirs* output i n  most cases.
This was accomplished without using the  subclassesspec ia l  t o  the medical material ,  which are used i n  a subsequent s tage  of pro-cessing preparatory t o  information r e t r i e v a l .Parsing ResultsParsing output is i n  t h e  form of a tree, i l l u s t r a t e d  f o r  a typicdl  frag-ment i n  Fig.

2100.0The aim i n  processing natural  language notes and records is t o  a r r i v e  a tforms f o r  the data which are su i tab le  f o r  computerized information re t r i eva l .The data s t ructures  must not change the  meaning.
This is why syntactic  methodsare knpo%ant.
Parsing with an English grammar provides the  gross s t ruc ture  ofinput sentences.
(The use of English transformations makes the  grammaticalanalysis more refined,) In each specialized technical area, more specific struc-ture is p~s~ibie, making use of the restricted word usage characteristic of thedisqourse in the given subject area.
K)A second stage of processing of this type is now being applied to the parsedcorpus of medical records and will be reported in a subsequent paper.
A con-venkent test of the adeqyacy of the parsing outputs is therefore whether they canserve as input to this second stage of processing (called forhatting).
It canbe seen in Table 4 that a number of "wrong" parses were still adequate as inputto the formatting; the segmentation of the sentence into parts was correct evenif the parts were assigned an incorrect syntactic status, e.g., object insteadof adjunct.
Only when the first parse was not adequate for formatting was thesentence rerun to obtain alternative analyses.The parsing times are a rough indication of the efficiency of the parsingbut two points should be kept in mind.
(1) The present LSP system is not a pro-duction model, but a research tool, with all that implies.
(2) A bignificantfraction of the input sentences were "no data" types, e,g., None this visit.These word sequences were so limited linguistically that a literal formula couldserve to reaogniae them.
The experimental use of such a formula cut down parsingtimes on the no-data entries from about 1.817 to0.030.
However, this formula wasnot used in the parsing summarized in Table 4,- -This investigation was supported by Public Health service Research Grantnumber CA-11531 from the National Cancer Institute.losee Ref.
