Pragmatic sensit iv i ty in NL interfacesand the structure of conversat ionTom WachtelScicon Ltd, LondonandResearch Unit  for Information Science & AI, Hamburg Univers i tyi .
In t roduct ionThe work reported here is being conducted aspart  of the LOKI  p ro jec t  (ESPRIT Pro jectI07, "A leg io  or iented approach to knowledgeand data bases support ing natura l  userin teract ion" ) .
The goal of the NL part  ofthe pro jec t  is  to bui ld  a pragmat ica l lysens i t i ve  natura l  language in ter face  to aknowledge base.
By "pragmat ica l lysens i t i ve" ,  we mean that  the system shouldnot only produce wel l - formed coherent andcohesive language (a minimum requirement ofany NL system designed to handle d iscourse) ,but should also be sens i t i ve  to thoseaspects o~ user behaviour that  humans aresens i t i ve  %o over and above simply providinga good response, inc lud ing producing outputthat  is  appropr ia te ly  decorated with thoseminor and semant ica l ly  inconsequentia lelements of language that  make thed i f fe rence  between natura l  language andnatura l  natura l  language.This paper concentrates on therepresentat ion  of the s t ruc ture  ofconversat ion in our system.
We w i l l  f i r s tout l ine  ~he representat ion  we use fo rdialogue moves, and then out l ine  the natureof the de f in i t ion  of wel l - formed dialoguethat  we are operat ing wi th .
F ina l ly ,  we w i l lnote a few extensions to the representat ionmechanism.2.
The HOVE f rameWe are  assuming a seven-s lo t  f rame fo r  therepresentat ion  of moves w i th in  a dia logue,with the fo l low ing  s lo ts :  HOVE, USER, AGENT,TURN, ACT~ BASE, CONT.
Every move in aconversat ion is  represented by such a frame.The HOVE s lo t  uniquely iden i t i f i es  apar t i cu la r  move in the conversat ion by anarb i t ra ry  in teger .
The USER s lo t  ident i f iesthe oucrent user of the system.
The AGENTs lo t  spec i f ies  whether i t  i~ a user move o~'a system move.
The TURN s lo t  has the valueOPEN n or CLOSE n, where n is  a number thatre fe rs  to a par t i cu la r  exchange.
Typ ica l ly ,a move with a value OPEN n fo r  the TURN s lo tmight be a request,  and one with a CLOSE nvalue the c~orresponding response.The ACT s lo t  spec i f ies  what act is  performedby the ut terance.
This w i l l  be e i ther  aspeech act ,  or the value ACTION, since nota l l  moves need be speech acts .
The range ofspeech acts that  the system wi l l  have toreoognise or' produce is  c lear ly  smal ler  thanthat  which occurs in conversat ions betweenhumans.
Furthermore, cer ta in  speech actsw i l l  be of primary importance given thedomain of app l i ca t ion  of the system, namely,as a f ront  end to an expert  system.
We havethere fore  produced an in i t ia l  h ierarchy ofpotent ia l l y  re levant  speech acts(Waehtel 1985a), where the majorc lass i f i ca t ion  is  in to  requests,  asser t ionsand commentaries.
Some of these are re fer redto below.
Many of the speech acts we use goone level  below what is  t rad i t iona l ly  viewedas a speech act ( i .e .
in the sense of Austin(~952), Searle (1969), e tc . )
and may becompared with d i s t inc t ions  that  McKeown(1985: 9 f f . )
,  fo r  example, discusses underthe category of " rhetor i ca l  p red icates" ,though they are by no means the same.
Theonly speech acts discussed below a~ere fer red  to by the fo l low ing  abbrev ia t ions :REQACT request - fo r -ac t ionREQAFF request - fo r -a f f ipmat ionSUPPAFF supp ly -o f -a f f i rmat ionREQCONST request - fo r -constantSUPPCONST supp ly -o f -constantREQCONF request - fo r -conf i rmat ionSUPPCONF supp ly -o f -conf i rmat ionThe BASE s lo t  spec i f ies  the current  top ic ,in the very res t r i c ted  sense cf a po inter  tothe node in the ~emantic network thatcorresponds to the ob ject  what the currentexchange is about.
This s imp l i s t i c  view oftop ic  is adopted here as a f i r s t  step only,and serves to i~ lus t ra te  the pointsdiscussed below.The CONT s lo t  spec i f ies  the semanticrepresentat ion  of the ut terance,  and weenvisage using the same representat ion  fo rsemantics and fo r  ac t ions ,  so that  a l lpossible ACT types can be representedun i formly  in the CONT s lo t .
In par t i cu la r ,we w i l l  def ine an exchange as a pai r  ofutterances with the same value fo r  the CONTs lo t ,  fo r  the time being.
This is of coursetoo s t r i c t .
Other funct ions  spec i fy ing35" loca l  coherence" in the sense of Hobbs(1982: 227) are also re levant  here.
Thepar t i cu la r  i l l oout ionary  force of anutterance w i l l  be a funct ion  of the value ofthe ACT s lo t  and the CONT s lo t .
Subdialoguesthat  are not in the mainstream of theconversat ion w i l l  be ident i f ied  bypar t i cu la r  re la t ionsh ip  of values fo r  theTURN s lo t  between adjacent moves, enhancedby the values of the ACT s lo ts  fo r  themoves .Some examples of the use of th i s  frame torepresent  sequences  of u t te rances  inconversat ions  can be found in Waohte l(1985b, 1985o), inc luding i t s  use toident i fy  sh i f t s  of top ic ,  subdialogues andrelevance, as well  as the contextuald isambiguat ion  of speech acts, which is themain top ic  of these work ing  papers.3.
The s t ruc ture  of conversat ionWe assume that  i t  is  possible to def ine thes t ruc ture  of a possible conversat ion byru le .
Actual human-human conversat ions maydefy such ana lys is ,  as i l l us t ra ted  by, fo rexample,  the work of Sachs,  Scheg lo f f  &Je f fe rson  (1974).
However, the poss ib leways in which the conversat ions we aredealing with may go are severely l im i ted  bythree fac tors :  (a) th i s  is  an in ter face  toan expert  system (or some s imi la r ly  spec i f i cso f tware) ,  which de l imi ts  the possible rangeof top ics ;  (b) one of the par t i c ipants  inthe dialogue is a machine, which means thati t  w i l l  not suddenly want to ind icate  that ,for example,  A lber t ' s  n iece is a f r iend f romschool ,  but this fact has no bear ing on thesuppor t ive  th ings  being said about  her; and(o) the other par t i c ipant  knows that  hisin ter locutor  is a machine, and w i l l  behaveaccord ing ly .
Therefore ,  what we need tomodel is not a typ ica l ly  natura l  open humanconversat ion,  but a res t r i c ted  type ofconversat ion that  also occurs between humansin cer ta in  wel l -c i rcumscr ibed contexts .
Forexample, a conversat ion between a would-bepassenger and a t i cket  c le rk  at a ra i lways ta t ion  is  c loser  to what we need to model,and in  such oases i t  is  possible to def inewhat is or is not a we l l - fo rmed conversat ionby ru les  of an abst rac t  nature that  may wel lbe inadequate fo r  other natura l ly  occurr ingconverat ions.We there fore  propose three ru les  that  def inethe not ion of wel l - formed conversat ion inthe present context ,  making the fo l low ingassumptions.
The s t ruc ture  of a conversat ioncan be represented as a t ree  s t ruc ture .
Thewellformedness of such t rees  can be definedby rewr i te  ru les .
The maximal number ofleve ls  of embedding in such t rees  is  s ix(see below).
In par t i cu la r ,  subdialogues canbe embedded w i th in  dialogues,  but there canbe no embedding w i th in  subdialogues.
Thelas t  res t r i c t ion  conf l i c ts  with what peopledo.
It i s  one of the res t r i c t ions  weconsider necessary, and which can be handledin such a way that  the user w i l l  not not ice36that  any such res t r i c t ion  ex is ts .We assume that  the fo l low ing  four categor iesare su f f i c ient  fo r  the representat ion  of thes t ruc ture  of conversat ion.
The symbols usedserve as mnemonics fo r  the i r  approximatecounterparts  in Engl ish,  but they should notbe s t r i c t ly  equated with them: CONV(conversat ion) ,  DIAL (d ia logue) ,  EXCH(exchange) and MOVE (as discussed above).To formulate in informal terms the generals ty le  and atmosphere of the ru les  that  wew i l l  propose more fo rmal ly  below, le t  us saythat  a CONV may cons is t  of one or moreDIALs, a DIAL may cons is t  of one or moreEXCHs, and an EXCH cons is ts  of two MOVEs,with each of these MOVEs fo l lowed by anopt iona l  DIAL.A major po int  about conversat ions that  mustbe handled in a grammar of th i s  type is thefac t  that  although MOVEs are the onlyterminal  nodes, and are there fore  the nodesthat  correspond to the utterances that  areac tua l ly  produced, with a l l  other  nodesrepresent ing more abst rac t  elements, cer ta infeatures  of conversat ion need to beassociated with these abst rac t  nodes.
Forexample, although each MOVE is spec i f ied  fo rwho the current  user of the system is andeach MOVE also has a par t i cu la r  top ic ,  asdiscussed above, these not ions proper lybelong to more abst rac t  leve ls  ofconversat ional  s t ruc ture .
Who the user  i scan be defined at the CONV level  ( i .e .
wedef ine a CONV as a conversat ion with oneuser) .
The top ic  of an utterance can bedefined at  the DIAL level  ( i .e .
a CONV cancons is t  of one or more dialogues,  each on as ing le  top ic ) .
Furthermore, a DIAL cancons is t  of one or more EXCHs, and i t  is  atth i s  po int  that  the content of theutterances that  form part  of that  EXCH isdef ined.Let us now be more prec ise.
We assume thatsome of the s lo ts  mentioned above in theMOVE frame are represented as features  onthe nodes in the t rees represent ing thes t ruc ture  of the conversat ion of which themoves described by the MOVE frames are par t .This assoc ia t ion  of features  with nodes,plus the assumption that  a l l  featurest r i ck le  down, with a few exceptionsdiscussed below, provides fo r  t rees  of thegeneral form shown in Table i .
The lowercase le t te rs  are constants.
Note that  thevalues of the BASE feature  on thesubdialogue nodes have not been spec i f ied .We re turn  to th i s  po int  below.

The same constant  is  used as thevalue of the feature  BASE in subdialogues.What th i s  amounts to is  a s t ipu la t ion  thatthe top ic  of a subdialogue is  the EXCH thati t  is  par t  o f ,  which seems to be about r ightin tu i t ive ly .
This is  what makes  themmeta l ingu is t io  in character .
Furthermore,note that  th i s  is  a case where afeature /va lue  pa i r  does not t r i ck le  down.This is  tantamount to s t ipu la t ing  that  DIALis  a BASE-bounding node: i t  creates" i s lands"  with BASEs that  do not extendupwards to  the main d ia logue,  but w i thoutoverwr i t ing  the BASE of the cur rent  maind ia logue.
Again, th i s  seems in tu i t ive lycor rect .Let us now provide a concrete example of thes t ructure  that  these ru les  assign to ad ia logue such as (4) .384 Ui When is the next  J ICAI  meeting?Si I presume you mean " I JCA I "U2 YesB2 Do you mean the next conferenceor the next conveners'  meeting?U3 Conference$3 12 AugustU4 19857$4 YesThe s t ructure  ie  g iven as Table 2.

This value has beengiven in a l l  re levant  oases, thus g loss ingover the fact  that  the BASE could not beident i f ied  immediately,  which is whattr iggeeed the subdialogues.

)The resu l t  is  that  (4) is now analysed as asix-move dia logue,  with the s t ruc ture  showna~ (8).MOVE i :  U, OPEN I ,  REQAFFIREQACTMOVE 2: S, CLOSE I ,  SUPPAFF(REQAFF)HOVE 3: S, OPEN 2, REQAFF(RE~ACT)MOVE 4: U, CLOSE 2, SUPPAFF(REQAFF(REQACT))MOVE 5: U, OPEN 3, RE~ACT, hypothet ica lHOVE &: S, CLOSE 3, ACTION5.
Ant ic ipatory  movesAnother type of i r=ea l i s  move is anant i c ipatory  move, where on the basis ofspec i f i c  clues the system ant ic ipates  whatthe user 's  next move w i l l  be.
Thed i f fe rence  between these and hypothet i ca lmoves is  that  no act ion  is taken by thesystem unt i l  there has been a react ion  fromthe user that  e i ther  confirms or d isoonf i rmsthe correctness of the move that  has beenant i c ipated .
The use of such moves w i l l  beof assistance in the in terpreta t ion  ofc rypt i c  fol low-.ups, as in (9).u: Can you provide progress repor ts  on LOKIsubprojeots?S: Yes.
Do you want to see them?U: LOKAS: (p r in ts )The user 's  second utterance must bein terpreted  as a request-for-action, whichi s  d i f f i cu l t  on formal grounds.
Withoutgoing in to  too much deta i l ,  we propose thatin such oases ths system should haveformulated an ant i c ipat ion  of a fo l low ing40request~for -ac t ion  before the user '~ nextu t terance .
\]'his could e i ther  be an e ;?p l i c i trequest=for -ac t ion  ("Please pr in t  the LOKAprogress repor t " ) ,  or ~imply "Yes" ( i .e .
aSUPPAFF(REQAFF(REgACT))), which wouldt r igger  a system request fo r  c la r i f i ca t ion ,perhaps, or anything else at  a l l  tha~ canserve  to ident i fy  the BASE of theant ic ipated  request - fo r -aCt ion .
This is  theimportant po int  about the ant i c ipat ien~Anything.

Any othersu f f i c ient ly  ident i fy ing  descr ip t ion  of there levant  subprc jeot  would have achieved thesame, such as any of the fo l low ing  <asappropr ia te ) :  the one based in Hamburg,Hamburg, NL, Max'~ projeot~ most ceeent~etc .6.
ConclusionsThe processes and formalisms out l ined  aboveare a l l  tentat ive  in nature,  and representpart  of an approach to the problem ofpragmatic sens i t i v i ty ,  ra ther  than purportedso lu t ions  to the problem.
We envisage thenas being part  of  a system that  uses amul t i - l eve l  parsing technique, with mutualassistance between d i f fe rent  subcomponentsof the parser,  so that  pragmatic in fo rmat ioncan immediately be used to ass i s t  par~ingifo r  syntax,  and so on.
We also see thatpar~ing w i l l  invo lve not only ~entenceparsing, but also conversat ion pars ing,  inthat  the appropr iate  s t ruc ture  of aconversat ion must be bu i l t  up at  each step.This is simply one fu r ther  part  of thegeneral parsing process~ but one that  weenvisage as being of assistance to otherparser suboomponents, as wel l  as fu l f i l l i ngi t s  primary funct ion  of making sure that  thesystem is  something of a conversat iona l i s t ,ra ther  than jus t  being a communicativeplodder.REFERENCE~Cole, P. & J.
