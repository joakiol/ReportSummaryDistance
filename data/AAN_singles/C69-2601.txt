Computers in the Yu~oslavSerbo-Croat/English ContrastiveAnalysis Project~eljko Bujas, Ph.D.Assistant ProfessorDepartment of EnglishZagreb University, Zagreb, Yugoslavia0.i.
As far as the present writer is aware, the Yu~o-s-~av Serbo-Croat/English Contrastive Analysis Project'isthe first contrastlve analysis effort to use a large cor-pus of parallel texts.
The corpus is made up of the BrownCorpus (reduced by 50%) with its Serbo-Croat translation,and a smaller Control Corpus (Serbo-Croat originals andEnglish translation).
A total, thus, of twice 500,000words plus twice 150,000 words, or a grand total of some1,300,000 words of running text.0.2.
The Project, let us make it clear, is not exclu-sively based on this corpus.
Compilation and confron-tation of grammatical statements by various authors, plusplain old intuition, figure prominently in the methodol-ogy.
The insistence on a large corpus, however, is due tothe conviction, prevailing among the Project workers, thatonly an extensive investigation of correspondences(original-language elements and their translations) canadequately reveal the less predictable patterns which ten~to have a considerable contrastive analysis potential.0.21.
The most productive method of obtaining correspon-dences from our corpus is to concordance separately itsSerbo-Croat and English parts, then to merge the resultingKWIC concordances into a contrastive KWIC concordance(with English keywords and alternating English and Serbo-Croat lines).
For the more promising patterns, the mergingprocedure will be used twice, with both English and Serbo-Croat keywords.0.22.
In view of the size of the corpus, and the exten-sive concordancing required as a major procedure in theProject, the need for computer processing is obvious.
Itrequires no undue strain on imagination to realize thesoul-numbing effect of sheer physical handling of thismass of text if written out on slips.Even in its most efficient and flexible form of amanual concordance (a sentence-slip file with keywordsunderlined monolingually), without which no manual pairingof correspondences is possible, the manual handling ofthis 1,300,O00-word corpus calls for a staggering amountof time and effort to prepare.
According to our carefulestimate, a total of 7,100 man-hours is required to makesuch a concordance (without the 1,900 hours of transla-tion from English to Sarbo-Croat, and vice versa).0.23.
The slip file thus obtained would, however, secureonly a one-way approach: either from English or Serbo-Croat.
A slip-file allowing a two-way approach would re-quire an additional effort of at least 4,500 man-hours.0.24.
Finally, even these two manual concordances wouldstill leave unfilled the need for reverse concordancing,go important for morphosyntactic research.
To meet thisneed, two additional (though less ample) slip files wouldi~ave to be established.1.0____~.
In view of all this, the Yugoslav Serbo-Croat/English Contrastive Analysis Project has from the outsetlinked the planning of its work to the services of a localcomputer, the City of Zagreb IBM 360/30 machine~1.1.._~.
StaF.e 1 of computer processing.
The tape with thefull text of the Brown Corpus (purchased from Brown Uni-versity, ~rovidence, R.l., U.S.~.
), which had been pre-pared on an IBM 7090 machine, had first to be convertedfrom the density of 800 ~'I to 1,600 BPI, required by theZagreb computer.1.?~__.._:_.
After this, a printout Of the entire text was ob-tained on the Zagreb machine.
The printing took abouteight hours, with a special program~restructuring theoriginal format of the Brown Corpus text.
This programleft out the location-marker column on the right-hand mar-gin of printout ~, and added a sequence of sentence numbers(from 00001 to 52533) on the left.1.12.
The full text of the Brown Corpus was now reducedhy 50%, retaining, however, as closely as possible, thes~Lme proportions of the 15 genres (styles) contained inthe Corpus.Printouts of the samples retained in this reducedversion were then sent out to reliable translators, se-lected to be representative of the three major regionalvariants of Serbo-Croat (western, central and eastern).Their instructions were to translate at normal speed, andas carefully as when they do any other paid translation~or~.
The only limitation imposed upon them was to observethe sentence limit in the original (English or, in theused for the preparation on the IBM 360/30 of a full for-w~rd EWIC concordance of the Serbo-Croat Corpus.~.~.
St~e 8.
Using the same tape, we now plan to pro-~uc~e a reverse KWIC concordance of the Serbo-Croat text.Ibis concordance will be selective in the same sense thatthe English reverse concordance was (cf.
Stage 4).Sta~e ~.
With the normal and reverse KWIC concord-a~ce~ of both the English and Serbo-Croat corpora now ob-tained ~, we can move on to the final stage(s) of centralimportance to the ~roject, i.e.
the merging of these mono-l ingual concordances to get contrastive concordances (cf.~ ).
We have planned four such concordances, and have~'~empted to i l lustrate them here by short simulated sam-~es .
AS at the time of writ ing this no concordances ofthe Brown Corpus text (either original or translation)w~re available, the text used for these samples is theS~zbo-Croat original and its translation into English ofthe novel Povratak Filipa Latinovicz_a~ (The Return ofihi l ip Latinovicz) by the contemporary Croat writer Miro-~lav Krle~a.!.91.

They were not to splitthe English sentence into two or more Serbo-Croat senten-ces, norwere  they allowed to combine two or more Englishsentences into one Serbo-Croat sentence.The reason for this was the need to secure a me-chanical palrin~ of the English (or Serbo-Croat) keyword~marked by its sentence number, with the same-numbered,parallel, Serbo-Croat (or English) sentence in the two-language concordancing planned for the later Projectstages.1.2..__~.
Sta~e 2.
A new magnetic tape will be prepared ofthe reduced Brown Corpus text, and with the sentence se-quence numbers interpolated.
This version will be usedfor all subsequent concordancing.1.3.
Sta~e 3.
Using this magnetic tape, the IBM 360/30will new prepare a full forward EWIC concordance of thereduced Brown Corpus text~1.4.
~ Now (while the reduced Brown Corpus isstill being translated) we shall use the same tape to ob-tain a reverse EWIC concordance of the same text.
S~nceall "function words" - such as of, had, most, those, did,etc.
- were already isolated in '~he-~ev i -~ st~g-~-(in--theforward concordance)?this will further reduce the n~ass oftext to be concordanced by one-half~1.5.
Sta~e 5.
The Serbo-Croat trsnslation of the reducedBrown Corpus, by now in an advanced stsge, will be copiedout on a Flexowriter in batches (as translators Rend intheir typescripts), resulting in a paper tape.The same procedure can, at thiz stage, be appliedto the 300,000 words of the Control Corpus.
No time fortranslation has to be set spart here, since only alreadypublished English translations of Serbo-Croat originslsare to be used.1.6.
Sta~e 6.
Although the Serbo-Cro~t paper tapes ob-~-ned  in the preceding stage are immeg~ately computer-processable, we shell convert them to a magnetic tape, be-cause this medium secures an incomparably speedier proees-sing on the computer.1.61.
We hope that stages 2 to 6 will not take more thantwenty weeks (if enough personnel can be hired simulta-neously).1.7.__.=.

The reason why these four concordances have beenpresented under one processing stage (9) is that, first,~e are not sure whether we can afford the computer foreach of them, and, second, we do not, at this point, knowhow selective each of them is going to be.
A considerablereduction of the text to be concordanced can be achievedin reverse concordancing if we restrict ourselves only toword~, ending in a characteristic morpheme with clearlyforeseeable contrastive analysis potential (such as -e._dd,-l_~!
-est, -in/~, -ness, -less, etc.
in English, and -ao,-vsl, -e--~n, -sc_..~u, -o-~, -~etc .
in Serbo-Croat).
--1.11.
It may be pointed out here that, irrespective ofhow restrictive the selection of keywords for concordanc-?n~ may have to be, no concessions should be made in theprinciple of bilingual approach.
Only if, in our investi-6ation of the contrastive potential of individual ele-ments, we strictly observe the approach from both theEnglish and the Serbo-Croat texts, can we be certain thatwe shall hsve covered all possible contrastive descriptionpatterns based on correspondences in both corpora.2.0__._t.
Once contrastive concordancing has been completedwe shall still be facing some practical technical problems.2.1.
Project analysts, for instance, will often have tobe provided with slips instead of computer printout sheets.Only if the material being analyzed is in the form ofslips will they be able to classify and reclassify the keyelements swiftly and flexibly (by putting together, break-ing up and re-establishing batches of slips).2.11.
Cutting up the concordance printouts to get theslips is not very practical in view of the varying size ofcontrasted pairs of elements with their context (cf.
n. 9,second half).
The way around this, clearly, is to have thepairs printed out at regular intervals with sufficientblank space in between.
This, however, would probablytriple the amount of printout paper required.
Also, thisis complicated further by the need for a number of copiesfor each pair (slip), because of simultaneous demands thatmay often be made upon the same slip by several Projectanalysts, approaching the same element from various des-criptive levels.
These copies could be secured by usingspecial, multiple-carbon printout paper, but this mightprove quite expensive.2.2.
In view of all this, the Yugoslav Serbo-Croat/English Contrastive Analysis Project has envisaged the useof a Flexowriter here as an alternative method.
This ma-chine has already provided us with the paper tape of theSerbo-Croat translation of the reduced Brown Corpus, plusthe tapes of Serbo-Croat originals and English transla-tions of the Control Corpus (cf.
Stage 5).
The missingpaper tape of the English text of the Brown Corpus can beobtained on a magtape-to-papertape converter.
Once bothpaper tapes are ready, running them through the Flexo-writer provides us with up to 13 (some claim 20) carbonsof each contrasted pair.
An additional advantage of usingthe Flexowriter for slip duplication is in the less awk-ward shape of slips.
Paper tapes reproduce the text in60-character-wide lines of the original translators' type-script, as opposed to the llO to 120-character streamersof normal computer printout (unless the concordance print-out was programmed for a narrower format, requiring con-siderably more paper).2.3.
The resulting slip files of sentence-numberedEnglish and Serbo-Croat texts, coupled with the Project'sbasic (monolingual - forward and reverse) concordances,can now be used as a replacement for contrastive concor-dances.
It would work approximately like this: upon receiv-&ing an analyst's request for examples of all corresponden-ces in the corpus of an element under analysis, the Projectheadquarters in Zagreb would look the element up in one ofthe basic concordances, record semtence numbers of all theoccurrences, extract slips bearing these numbers from theFlexowriter-produced slip file, and forward them to theanalyst for further research.FootnotesI.

In a total reverse concordance they would only appearin a different place: of under F, had under D, etc.7.
~uttimg the top lO0 words from the Brown Corpus RankList on the exclusion list (compared to a total of some1SO "function words", in the present author's estimate),would reduce the text by 47.4 per cent, while includingonly one morphologically marked word (YEARS) and twolexical words (~iEW, TIME).
Expanding the exclusion listto cover the top 200 words would probably not be econom-ical (though only two additional morphologically markedwords would be included: UI~ITED and STATES), becausethe computer would be slowed down, whereas the textual8.9.mass would be reduced by only 6 more per cent (to 53.6per cent.Which may take between 40 and 60 computer hours, as op-posed to an estimated 2,350 hours of manual processing(for only the English forward concordance at that).In addition to being simulations, all these concordancesamples are in an idealized format, with the correspon-dences spatially parallel to the keyword.
In practice,however, it is impossible to achieve this ideal textualparallelism, because there are no other formal signalsto govern it, except the sentence sequence number whichcan only mark the sentence as a whole.For this reason, the actual computer concordances will,when ready, have the correspondence to the keywordprinted out with the whole sentence in which it occurs,under the single line with the keyword.
This will, natu-rally, increase the size of the concordance, but notmore than about 50 per cent in our estimate.
This is be-cause only an approximate 40 per cent of all sentencesin the original text of the Brown Corpus are in excessof 20 words (which can be accommodated by the averageprintout line).
A mere 6 per cent of these sentencesare longer than 40 words, requiring, consequently, :.orethan two printout lines.4
