Among the attrac-tive properties of the statistical approach is its ca-pability to learn the translation models automati-cally from a (sufficiently) large amount of source-target sentence pairs.
Thus the need for the manualdesign of suitable rules and for human interactioncan be reduced dramatically when developing anMT system for a new application or language pair.The idea of hybrid MT is to combine the ad-vantages of both the rule-based and statistical ap-proaches.
In practice, most statistical MT sys-tems make use of manually designed rules in or-der to improve the MT accuracy.
We revisit theRWTH systems in order to study the effect of typ-ical preprocessing steps based on manually de-signed rules.
The RWTH systems cover varioustasks (e.g.
news, patents, lectures) and various lan-guages (e.g.
Arabic, Chinese, English, Japanese).The preprocessing steps may include a categoriza-tion of numbers, date and time expressions, a worddecomposition based on morphological analysisand explicit word re-ordering based on a syntacticanalysis.
In general, the preprocessing steps maydepend heavily on the language pair under consid-eration.We will also address concepts that aim at atighter integration of the conventional rule-basedand the statistical approaches.
We will considerthe implications of such a tight integration for thearchitecture of an MT system.7
