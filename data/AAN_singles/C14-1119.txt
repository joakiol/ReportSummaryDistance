To alleviate this burden as well as enrich hyperlinks in Wikipedia articles, we propose amethod for transferring intra-language links between different-language articles linked via an inter-language link.
The method avoids anchor selection and disambiguation problems by which usual wikifi-cation methods are affected, by exploiting the analogy between different language editions of Wikipedia.The effectiveness of the method was demonstrated through an experiment of transferring intra-languagelinks from English to Japanese.
It increased the number of intra-language links in Japanese articles by40.9%, and the accuracy of anchors selected was estimated to be 96.3%.1 IntroductionWikipedia is a Web-based encyclopedia constructed collaboratively by many contributors and contin-ues to enlarge and improve daily.
Because of its overwhelming scale, improved quality, and multilin-gual nature, it has acquired a huge number of readers worldwide.
One of the distinguishing features ofWikipedia is that it is a hypertext, which greatly enhances its usefulness and usability.
That is, an arti-cle is linked to its related articles in the same language via intra-language links as well as to its coun-terpart articles in different languages via inter-language links (ILLs), and readers can navigate withinmillions of articles.Editing Wikipedia articles naturally includes linking them to their related articles, which imposes anadditional burden on contributors.
As a result, Wikipedia articles may remain incomplete; they some-times lack important links as well as contain incorrect links.
Thus, it is desirable to automate link-related editorial tasks such as embedding links in new articles and verifying links in existing articles.Linking a plain text, usually non-Wikipedia articles, to Wikipedia articles is called wikification, andmuch effort has been devoted to developing a variety of wikification methods over the past decade(Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008a; Fogarolli, 2009; Ratinov et al., 2011).
How-ever, wikification methods are still immature and affected by two hard problems; anchor selection,which involves keyword extraction or term recognition, and destination-article determination, which isa kind of word sense disambiguation (WSD).We focused on the comparability of intra-language links between different language editions ofWikipedia, and developed a method for transferring intra-language links in one language edition toanother language edition.
Although the method is not applicable to texts other than Wikipedia articles,it avoids the problems of anchor selection and destination-article disambiguation by using analogywith different language editions.
It does not require any language resources other than Wikipedia itself.When the target language is a morphologically rich one, a morphological analyzer is also required.Although the method is applicable to any language pairs, we evaluated its effectiveness through anThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Thesetwo articles, which describe the sameentity, concept or topic, are comparable.Note that this comparability holds notonly for texts in articles but also forintra-language links, each of whichlinks an anchor or an important termwithin an article to another same-language article describing the entity,concept, or topic denoted by the an-chor term.
Figure 1 gives an examplepair of ILL-linked articles; an Englisharticle ?Tata Motors?
and a Japanese article ?????????.?
The former has an intra-languagelink from an anchor ?Jaguar?
to the English article ?Jaguar Cars,?
while the latter has an intra-language link from an anchor ??????
to the Japanese article ?????
(???).?
These twointra-language links are comparable: namely, the anchors are translations of one another and the desti-nation articles are linked via an ILL.The above fact inspired us to develop a method for transferring intra-language links between ILL-linked articles to enrich the intra-language links in each article.
Suppose an extreme case in which anarticle ?
in one language, which is linked to its counterpart ?
in another language via an ILL, has nointra-language links.
An intra-language link can be transferred from ?
to ?
as follows.
First, followingan intra-language link (?
to ??)
and then the ILL (??
to ??
), the final destination article ??
is identi-fied as that to be linked from ?.
Second, the text of ?
is searched for possible anchors for the destina-tion article ?
?, which are learned from the entire Wikipedia beforehand.
If two or more possible an-chors are found, the most appropriate one will be selected according to a certain criterion.
For example,suppose all intra-language links are missing from the Japanese article ??????????
in Figure1.
The intra-language link from the English article ?Tata Motors?
to ?Jaguar Cars?
and the ILL from?Jaguar Cars?
to ?????
(???)?
suggest that the Japanese article ??????????
shouldhave an intra-language link to ?????
(???).?
The possible anchors for ?????
(???
),?which have been learned from all the Wikipedia articles linked to it, include ?????
(???),??????,?
and others.
Since the text of ??????????
contains ?????,?
it is selected asthe anchor for the destination article ?????
(???).
?It should be noted that our proposed method avoids the two hard problems in wikification, anchorselection and disambiguation, by exploiting the intra-language links provided by Wikipedia in anotherlanguage.
Resulting anchors are certainly important terms within ?, since their counterparts have beenselected as anchors by the author of counterpart ?
in another language.
Even if an anchor were an am-biguous term, i.e., had two or more possible destination articles, it would be certainly linked to the ap-propriate one due to the ?one sense per discourse?
hypothesis (Gale et al., 1992).
The hypothesis isextended to a pair of ILL-linked articles, ?
and ?, as follows.
A pair of corresponding anchors shouldbe regarded as a single term and express the same sense in a discourse shared by ?
and ?.
In otherwords, they should be linked to articles that are linked via an ILL.
Since the proposed method relies onthis extended hypothesis, it will select correct destination articles for anchors in ?
as long as anchors in?
have been linked to their correct destination articles.It should also be noted that the proposed method first determines the destination articles then theanchors for them, while usual wikification methods first select anchors then determine their destina-tion articles.
The main reason for this is convenience of implementation; cross-language mapping ofFigure 1.
Transferring intra-language link.1261destination articles is one-to-one (or one-to-zero), while that of anchors can be one-to-many.
Deter-mining destination articles prior to anchors, however, results in an additional advantage that allows adestination article to be proposed without an anchor for it.
Since the pair ?
and ?
is not parallel but justcomparable, the counterpart of an anchor in ?
is not always found in ?.
This is often the case when ?is incomplete, under construction, or written in a different style from that of ?.
In such a case, ourmethod proposes a destination article ??
without an anchor, and ?
will be linked to ??
once ?
is en-larged to contain a term appropriate as the anchor for ?
?.3 Proposed MethodThe proposed method is divided into two steps; the preprocessing step for collecting possible anchorsfor all Wikipedia articles in a target language as well as estimating probabilities required in the suc-ceeding step and the main step for transferring intra-language links in a source-language article ?
tothe target-language article ?
linked to ?
via an ILL.
In this section, a triplet (?, ?, ??)
denotes an intra-language link from anchor ?
in article ?
to destination article ??
and, likewise, a triplet (?, ?, ??)
does.Note that although an article can have two or more intra-language links from the same anchor at dif-ferent positions in the text to the same destination article, they are treated as a single link.3.1 Preprocessing StepCollecting Possible Anchors for Wikipedia ArticlesThe title of a Wikipedia article can be used as an anchor for the article.
However, a title is often ac-companied by a parenthesized note indicating the domain of the article to discriminate from other arti-cles with the same title.
The title ?????
(???)?
of an article that describes a car named Jaguaris an example; the parenthesized note ?(???)?
discriminates the article from another article ?????
?, which describes an animal belonging to the cat family.
Such a title accompanied by a parenthe-sized note rarely occurs in usual texts, and the title with the parenthesized note deleted is often markedas an anchor.
Accordingly, we also regard a title with a parenthesized note deleted (e.g., ??????
)as a possible anchor.
Other terms, typically synonyms of the article title, are often used as anchors.Therefore, we collect terms that are actually used as anchors for each article from the entire Wikipedia.Finally, we threshold possible anchors by their keyphraseness to eliminate general words.
Thekeyphraseness ?(?)
of a term ?
is defined as the probability that ?
is used as an anchor in Wikipediaarticles (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007), i.e.,?(?)

and  ??????(??)
are ??
?s title with and without the parenthesized note, respectively,and ?
is the threshold for the keyphraseness.Estimating ProbabilitiesThe following probabilities, which will be used to select one from among possible anchors for a desti-nation article, are estimated from the entire Wikipedia.?

be source-language and target-language articles that are linked via an ILL, respectively.Intra-language links in ?
are transferred to ?
as follows:(i) For each source-language intra-language link (?, ?, ??
), do (ii) to (v).
(ii) If ??
has an ILL to an article in the target language, let ??

Otherwise, output ?NOT TRANSFERRED?
and move to the next intra-language link.
(iii) If A(??)
is empty, output the transferred intra-language link (?, NULL, ??
), which means that?
should be linked to ??
but does not contain a term appropriate as the anchor, and move tothe next intra-language link.
(iv) For each possible anchor ?
?
A(??
), search the text of ?
for ?.
If found, let pos(?, ?)
denotethe position of its first occurrence in the text; otherwise, let pos(?, ?)
= ?1.

according to an an-chor priority score Score(?

Otherwise, output the transferred in-tra-language link (?, NULL, ??
).We have the following five alternative anchor priority scores in step (v) above.?
Anchor translation probability: Score1(?)
= P(?|?
).This score favors the anchor that occurs most frequently as counterpart to the source-languageanchor.?
Anchor probability: Score2(?)
= P(?|??

,where dist(?, ??)
is the Levenshtein distance between character strings ?
and ??
(Levenshtein,1966), and len(?)
is the length of character string ?.This score favors the anchor with the highest similarity to the article?s title without a parenthe-sized note, which is the most representative term denoting the entity, concept, or topic describedin the article.?
Position: Score5(?)
= 1 pos(?, ?)?
.Note that in a Wikipedia article, among two or more occurrences of an important term, the firstone tends to be marked as an anchor.12634 Experiment4.1 Experimental SettingsWe conducted an experiment on transferringintra-language links from the English editionto the Japanese edition of Wikipedia.Input DataThe English edition of Wikipedia (2013-04-03dump), consisting of 4,241,324 articles, andthe Japanese edition of Wikipedia (2013-03-28dump), consisting of 951,411 articles1, wereused for the experiment.
Intra-language linkswere extracted from each dump file, and ILLswere obtained from Wikidata (2013-03-28dump).
Redirect pages were resolved prelimi-narily, i.e., if the destination of an intra-language link or ILL was a redirect page, thedestination was replaced with an article pointed by the redirect page.From among a total of 366,358 pairs of English and Japanese articles linked by ILLs, 3,595 pairswere randomly selected as a test set.
The remaining pairs were used as training data for constructingEnglish and Japanese intra-language link sets, ??
and ??.
The English articles in the test set contained179,963 intra-language links in total; these were input to the algorithm of the proposed method.Keyphraseness ThresholdLimiting possible anchors to meaningful ones and gaining many links are in a trade-off relation ad-justable by the keyphraseness threshold ?.
In the experiment, ?
was set to 0, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1.Keyphraseness values of several anchors are listed in Table 1.
Technical words (e.g., ??????????????
?
Bayesian network) and uncommon proper names (e.g., ???????
?
Dic-tionnaire Infernal) tend to have high keyphraseness values.
Common words (e.g., ????
?
devil and????
?
conflict) and proper names (e.g., ????
?
Paris and ??????
?
Nicholas), especiallyidentical to a general noun, have middle or low values according to their commonness.
Although somefunctional words (e.g., ????
?
from) may be included in possible anchors for the Wikipedia articlesof their homographic content words (e.g., ????
?
Yori (kana)), they naturally have extremely lowvalues.
By setting ?
to a value slightly greater than zero, functional words could be removed from pos-sible anchors.Comparison of Anchor Priority ScoresTo determine the most effective anchor priority score, the accuracy of anchors selected according toeach score was evaluated, assuming the existing intra-language links in the original Japanese articlesas gold standard.
That is, anchor accuracy Acc is defined as the percentage of originally pointed desti-nation articles for which correct anchors were selected, i.e.,Acc =|??????

is a set consisting of all transferred intra-language links and ???????
is the gold stand-ard intra-language link set.
Table 2 lists the anchor accuracies for each anchor priority score and each?.
Anchor translation probability exhibited the best results and, therefore, we adopted anchor transla-tion probability as the anchor priority score.1 Redirect pages and articles with no intra-language links were not included in these counts.Anchor EnglishtranslationKeyphrase-ness????????????Bayesiannetwork1?????DictionnaireInfernal0.810???

Not transferred to a Japanese intra-language link  (dashed underline in Figure 2)Table 3 lists the numbers of English intra-language links per class.
The proposed method addedmany new intra-language links to Wikipedia articles.
Since the total number of existing Japanese intra-language links in the test-set articles was ?
= 161,940, the increase rate of Japanese intra-languagelinks was 100(?

??
= 100(13,916 + 52,275) 161,940?
= 40.9%  (?
= 0 ).
When new linkswithout anchors were excluded, the increase rate was 100?

31,770/(31,770 + 1,219) =96.3% (?

Anchor accuracy of new intra-language links could not be calculated because of theunavailability of gold standard data.
However, the proposed method specifies the anchor ?
for destina-tion article ??
only when possible anchors for it is found in the target-language article ?.
The specifiedanchor ?
is likely to be the counterpart of source-language anchor ?
pointing to ??
that is the source-language counterpart of ?
?, regardless of whether ?
already points to ??
or not.
Thus, the anchor accu-racy of new links should be similar to that of existing links.Among the ?

52,275 179,963?
=29.0% (?

Thiswas because different language articles contain different contents even though they are linked via anILL.
The anchor-unspecified links are put in the ??????
sections (?See also?
sections) of target-language articles, and Wikipedia authors are expected to enlarge or revise the articles so that these an-chor-unspecified links can be converted to anchor-specified links.
Additionally, among the ?

We assumed this was mainly due to missing Japanesearticles.
Note that the total number of Japanese articles is less than one-fourth that of English articles.The percentage of not-transferred links will decrease with the growing number of Japanese articles.Anchor priority score Anchor accuracy (%)?

Anchorprobability is also useful because this is a posterior probability of the anchor for the destination.
High-er accuracy with spelling score indicates that Wikipedia editors tend to use the title of the destinationas an anchor.
This may be caused by manually specifying the anchor and destination independently.Contrary to expectations that the first occurrence likely becomes an anchor, position score exhibitedthe worst results.
More detailed analysis of the context in which a term tends to be selected as an an-chor is necessary.Table 2 shows that the anchor probability, unexpectedly, decreases with a rise of the keyphrasenessthreshold.

Example results of transferring intra-language links.Jacques Collin de PlancyJacques Albin Simon Collin de Plancy(Plancy-l'Abbaye, 28 January 1793 ?Paris,1881) was a French occultist, demonologistand writer; he published several works onoccultism and demonology.
[1][2]He was born Jacques Albin Simon Collin on28 (in some sources 30) January 1793 inPlancy (presently Plancy-l'Abbaye) son ofEdme-Aubin Collin and Marie-Anne Danton,sister of Georges-Jacques Danton who wasexecuted the year after Jacques was born.
[3]He later added the aristocratic "de Plancy"himself - an addition which would later causeaccusations against his son in his career as adiplomat.
He was a free-thinker influenced byVoltaire.
He worked as a printer and publish-er in Plancy-l'Abbaye and Paris.
Between1830 and 1837, he resided in Brussels, andthen in the Netherlands, before he returned toFrance after having converted to the Catholicreligion.

station).
When the threshold was set high, the possible anchor set forsuch an article became empty and, as a results, the algorithm failed to reproduce the existing links to it.In this experiment, we transferred English links onto Japanese articles.
Since the English edition ofWikipedia is richer than Japanese, it has been assumed that an English-to-Japanese direction is moreeffective than the inverse.
However, among the 179,963 links in English and 161,940 links in Japaneseextracted from the test set of English-Japanese article pairs, only 32,989 links are paired with theircounterparts and others do not have counterparts.
This fact indicates that a Japanese-to-English trans-fer of links is also useful for enriching English articles.
It also leads a low anchor recall, which is thepercentage of correct links among existing links: 100?
??
= 100 ?
31,770 161,940?
= 19.6% (?
=0).
Combining usual wikification techniques should help improve the anchor recall.5 DiscussionWe now discuss two future directions, an extension to multiple language combination and a variationfor inappropriate intra-language link detection.The proposed method can be straightforwardly extended to three or more language combinations:Even if two source articles in two different languages are handled separately, the target article wouldbe more enriched with the union of two transferred link sets.
While this contributes to increasing thecoverage of links, the reliability of links can also be improved by taking the intersection of the twotransferred link sets.
A more sophisticated combination of multiple source languages is a further prob-lem.In the experiment, existing links were used as the gold standard for evaluation, despite the fact thatthey are not always appropriate because they are manually created by unspecified contributors.
Forexample, there is a biology-related article containing an anchor ?translation?
linking to an article?Translation?
describing language translation, not to another article ?Translation (biology).?
Such anincorrect intra-language link may be detected using a similar method as the proposed one.
In the aboveexample, suppose the Japanese counterpart article contains an anchor ????
linking to an article ???
(???).?
Two anchors ?translation?
and ????
correspond to each other but their destinationarticles are not linked via an ILL.
This inconsistency may be evidence for an inappropriate intra-language link.
Note that which of the English and Japanese links is inappropriate cannot be easily de-termined.
How to estimate the appropriateness of intra-language links is a problem to be solved.6 Related WorkWikification, which aims at linking mainly non-Wikipedia articles to Wikipedia articles, can be natu-rally applied to linking between Wikipedia articles.
There has been much research on wikification,most of which focused on disambiguation of destination articles (Milne and Witten, 2008a; Fogarolli,2009; Ratinov et al., 2011).
Determining an appropriate destination article for an anchor term is a spe-cial case of WSD.
Although a variety of ideas for WSD have been adapted to wikification, their per-formance is not satisfactory and there is room for further improvement.
Another important issue withwikification is anchor selection, although most literature on wikification avoids the issue by selectingevery term that is used as an anchor in any Wikipedia article.
Anchor selection is a keyword extractionproblem, which has been tackled using syntactic, statistical, and/or machine learning techniques butremains room for further improvement (Jacquemin and Bourigault, 2003).
It should be added that ourproposed method avoids both disambiguation and anchor selection problems by exploiting link infor-mation in another language edition of Wikipedia.Adafre and de Rijke (2005) proposed a method for finding ?missing intra-language links?
in a Wik-ipedia article by assuming that an intra-language link represents the relatedness between concepts de-scribed by the linked articles.
Their method adds intra-language links to an article by using articleswith similar link structures as that of the article in question.
Similar methods that use the Wikipedia?slink structures as a semantic network have been proposed for entity linking (Milne and Witten, 2008b;Fogarolli, 2009; Ratinov et al., 2011).
These still remain monolingual methods; the availability of oth-er language editions cannot be assumed.A bilingual approach to improving quality of Wikipedia articles has also been studied.
Sorg andCimiano (2008) proposed a method for finding new ILLs by using a classifier whose features include1267the number of ILLs between articles pointed by an article in one language and those pointed by an ar-ticle in another language.
Wang et al.
(2013) improved the classifier by extending the intra-languagelinks to increase the number of features.
Both methods and our proposed method exploit the compara-bility between intra-language links in different language editions.
However, while the former find newILLs, the latter finds new intra-language links.7 ConclusionWe proposed a method for enriching intra-language links in Wikipedia articles.
It transfers intra-language links between a pair of different language articles linked by an inter-language link throughthe following two steps: first, determine destination articles to which the target-language article shouldbe linked by following a source-language intra-language link and an ILL successively from each of theanchors in the source-language article; second, determine an anchor for each of the destination articlesby searching the target-language article for possible anchors and selecting the most appropriate oneaccording to the anchor translation probability criterion if two or more possible anchors are found.
Un-like usual wikification methods, our method avoids anchor selection and disambiguation problems byexploiting the comparability of intra-language links between different language editions of Wikipedia.We conducted an experiment of transferring intra-language links from the English edition to the Jap-anese edition to evaluate the effectiveness of our method.
The method increased the number of intra-language links in Japanese articles by 40.9%, and the accuracy of anchors selected was estimated to be96.3%.
Future work includes an extension to multiple language combination and a variation for inap-propriate intra-language link detection.ReferencesAdafre, Sisay Fissaha and Maarten de Rijke.
