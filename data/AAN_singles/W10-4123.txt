Inthis paper, we propose a Chinese Man-darin Digital Multi-modal Corpus(CMDMC), which is a digital speechmuseum with diachronic, opened, cross-media and sharable features.
It has over3460 hours video and audio files withmetadata tagging.
The materials, whichwere generated by the authoritativespeakers (e.g.
announcers at TV or radiostation) with normality, are requiredsamples if we can get them.
Based onthis resource, we also intend to analyzethe syntactic correlations of prosodicphrase in broadcasting news speech, andcompare the phonetic and prosodic fea-tures in movie dialogues among severalsame-name movies in different histori-cal eras.1 IntroductionModern Chinese Mandarin has gone throughnear a hundred years.
As language changes associety develops, Mandarin must be periodicallymarked with the different features of differenthistorical eras.
It is very important to design andconstruct a Chinese Mandarin Digital Multi-modal Corpus (CMDMC), and store its repre-sentative sample in digital form permanently.It?s international trend to establish large-scalenatural language corpus, and many countriespay more attention to research and preservetheir national language.
For instance, the Lin-guistic Data Consortium (LDC) is an open con-sortium of universities, companies and govern-ment research laboratories.
It creates, collectsand distributes speech and text databases, lex-icons, and other resources for research and de-velopment purposes1.
Since its foundation, theLDC has delivered data to 197 member institu-tions and 458 non-member institutions.
Moreo-ver, European Language Resources Association(ELRA)2The paper is organized as follows: Section 2describes the resources and data processing ofour CMDMC.
The experiment and evaluation isdesigned and carried out in section 3.
Section 4is dedicated to analyze the syntactic correlationsof prosodic phrase in broadcast news speech onCNR (China National Radio), and compare theis the driving force to make availablethe language resources for language engineeringand to evaluate language engineering technolo-gies.
In order to achieve this goal, ELRA is ac-tive in identification, distribution, collection,validation, standardization, improvement, inpromoting the production of language resources,in supporting the infrastructure to perform eval-uation campaigns and in developing a scientificfield of language resources and evaluation.
Inthis paper, we intend to establish the CMDMCwith the goal of showing the history of the de-velopment of Chinese Mandarin, and represen-tation the real character in different historicaleras.1 The Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC),http://www.ldc.upenn.edu.2 European Language Resources Association (EL-RA), http://www.elra.info/.phonetic and prosodic features in movie dialo-gues.
Finally, some conclusions and outlines ofour future work are given in section 5.2 General Description of CMDMCIn order to show the history of the developmentof Chinese Mandarin, and representation thereal character in different historical periods, theCMDMC, which is a dynamic miniature model(or speech museum) with diachronic, opened,cross-media and sharable features, is designedand constructed by Broadcast Media LanguageBranch of National Language ResourcesMonitor & Research Center at CommunicationUniversity of China.In China, announcers in Radio & TV stations,as well as movie or stage actors, are the authori-ty of the national language standardization.Therefore, the speech in radio, television andmovie can be taken as the paradigm and repre-sentative of Mandarin.
They can reflect thephonetic situation of that era.
All of these arethe source of the sample data for CMDMC.2.1 Description of ResourcesIn order to fully demonstrate the developmentof Chinese Mandarin by the past 100 years, wetry to collect all the video or audio materials indifferent periods.
Therefore, a state-of-the-artclassification is defined based on the corporathat we got.Language styles: According to characteristicspeaking styles of different media, there arethree categories was defined, such as broadcastmedia language, movie or drama dialogue, andthe dialogue in folk art (e.g.
xiangsheng, ping-shu etc.)
and so on.
To sum up, the three speak-ing styles accounted for about 64.9%, 27.2%and 7.9% of total corpora, respectively.Mediums: The materials can be divided intoaudio, video, text and image/picture.
The audioor video files are the main materials in our cor-pus, and the aligned texts are transcribed basedon the audio or video.
The documents of imageare subsidiary corpora.Historical eras: Based on the characteristicsof social and language changes, we also definesix historical stages of Chinese Mandarin: 1)Before1949 (or 1919-1949), it is a theoreticalstage for corpora collection.
In fact, the earliestspeech materials, which we can collect, is re-leased in 1932; 2) 1949-1965; 3) 1966-1977; 4)1978-1989; 5) 1990-1999; 6) 2000 to today.Table 1 shows the distribution of detailed datain different eras.ErasBroadcastmedia(hours)Movie/drama(hours)Folkart(hours)Percentof total(%)1932-49 39.3 1.11949-65 5.2 191.4 20 6.21966-77 17.5 93.0 3.21978-89 52.4 145.9 75.5 7.91990-99 43.5 137.5 11.5 5.62000-- 2131.5 337.0 167.1 76.0Total 2250.1 944.1 274.1Table 1: The distribution of video and audiomaterials in different eras.2.2 Data ProcessingThe data processing includes metadata tagging,text transcription and aligning, phonetic andprosodic annotation, POS and syntactic taggingand so on.As for labeling prosodic phrase boundaries,we strictly dependent on the prosodic criteriaand perception by using the wave files and theirtranscriptions, which use many prosodic fea-tures such as F0 contour, energy contour etc.
Atthe same time, some spoken phenomena areconsidered.3 Experiment and EvaluationFirstly, in order to investigate the correlationsbetween prosody and syntax, about 13 hoursspeech materials were selected to segment andlabel, including break index, stress index andsummary of emotional tendentiousness etc.Before the real annotation, six transcribers havebeen trained in accordance with the prosodiclabeling conventions, until a high consistency ofprosodic annotation can be carried out.According to above experiment and annota-tion, the number of occurrences of the variousboundaries was calculated in table 2.Secondly, we also designed a perception ex-periment to determine phonetic diversificationfor elimination as much as possible the subjec-tivity which could be caused by the differentpersonal intuition of language.
Ten people at-tended the perception experiment of this study:3 men and 7 women.
The average age is 25years.
Nearly all of them were graduates major-ing in linguistics.
During the experiment, theparticipants were asked to discriminate 12 para-graphs of random materials and judge the natu-ralness, pitch, and speech rate of the sentencesproduced in each paragraph.
These 12 para-graphs consisted of 4 from 21 paragraphs of the1995 version, 4 from 21 paragraphs of the 1975version and 4 from modern materials.BoundariesTypes Index Marker FrequencyPW 1 /1, /1+ 55237PP 2 /2 28867C-PP 2 /2* 5976IP 3 /3 7147IG 4 /4 2781MEC 5 /5 1770Table 2: Distribution of all boundaries.
The PW,PP, C-PP, IP, IG and MEC are the abbreviation ofprosodic word, normal prosodic phrase, complexprosodic phrase, intonational phrase, intonationalgroup and meaning expression cluster respectively.In the perceptive procedure, we disordered allthese materials for experiment, and three choic-es were given to these ten people: 1) natural, inconformity with the standard of modern Manda-rin; 2) fairly natural, close to the standard ofmodern Mandarin; 3) unnatural, a little stagy.Every paragraph was released twice with aninterval of 10 seconds.
After one hour of conti-nuous work, a 10-minute break was given.Only the results with at least a 90% agree-ment rate were considered for analysis.4 Related WorksBased on this resource, we intend to analyze thesyntactic correlations of prosodic phrase inbroadcasting news speech on CNR, and com-pare the phonetic and prosodic features inmovie dialogues among several same-namemovies in different historical eras.4.1 Correlation between Syntax & ProsodyIn English, there is a strong correlation betweenprosodic phrase boundaries and syntactic phraseboundaries (Price et al 1991).
That is to say,prosodic phrase boundaries can play an impor-tant role in understanding utterance as punctua-tion marks do in written language.
An investiga-tion propose that boundary strength according tothe measure, which the boundary strength isapplied to syntactic structures and the phrasestructure is viewed as an immediate constituen-cy tree exclusively, corresponds much moreclosely to empirical prosodic boundary strengththan does syntactic boundary strength accordingto a standard measure (Abney, 1992).
In Greek,some study indicated that prosodic phrasing hasa 95% identification rate, and a major effect onfinal tonal boundaries (Botinis et al 2004).In Chinese, some researchers also proposed astatistical model to predict prosodic words fromlexical words.
In their model, both length of theword and the tagging from POS are two essen-tial features to predict prosodic words, and theresults showed approximately 90% of predictionfor prosodic words (Chen at el.
2004).What the correlation between syntax andprosody is in Chinese broadcasting news speech?In order to investigate the syntactic correlationsof prosodic phrase in real read speech on radio,we chose the representative speech materialsfrom Xinwen he Baozhi Zhaiyao (News andNewspapers Summary) from CMDMC, which isa very famous broadcast news program of CNR.This news program contains more syntactic,semantic and prosodic information, speakingstyles and high quality voice in real context.Therefore, 908 programs, which contain 454hours speech data from January 2006 to June2008, were selected for pre-processing.
Afterthe pre-processing step, we selected two fe-male?s 13 hours speech materials (one femaleannouncer?s material forms the main data, andanother one?s is supplemented for comparabledata) as a core database, which segmentation,transcription and prosodic annotation (includingbreak index, stress index and summary of emo-tional tendentiousness etc) was made by sixtranscribers.According to the characteristic of broadcast-ing news speech, a new prosodic hierarchicalstructure (Zou et al 2009) and two differenttypes of prosodic phrase (i.e.
the normal prosod-ic phrase and the complex prosodic phrase)boundaries were defined and used in our datalabeling.Top pitch value Bottom pitch valueCategories Location N SD Mean N SD MeanPW Left 3478 3.917 16.1 3253 4.761 8.5Right 3701 4.894 14.7 3165 5.457 9.9PP Left 1741 3.891 14.7 1718 4.302 6.2Right 627 3.481 16.5 492 5.077 9.3C-PP Left 314 4.085 13.5 317 4.135 4.8Right 361 3.616 17.9 285 5.092 10.0IP Left 536 4.817 12.9 456 5.575 3.9Right 531 3.019 18.8 473 3.720 13.8IG Left 211 4.363 11.4 203 6.055 4.7Right 229 2.377 19.4 185 2.927 15.0MEC Left 104 4.238 8.1 95 4.937 2.6Right 22 2.178 18.7 12 2.893 16.2Table 3: The distribution of pitch on different boundaries.
The phonetic acoustic data of eachsyllable was extracted by Praat script, and the foundational frequency was normalized by semi-tones, the normalization formula is ST=12*log (F0/Fref)/log2 (the female?s reference frequencyis 100Hz).
(?top?
is the mean of the highest pitch value at the first tone and the fourth tone;?bottom?
is the mean of the lowest pitch value at the third tone and the fourth tone; ?N?
refersthe number of samples; ?SD?
is the abbreviation of standard deviation)In the further step, we selected 100 minutesspeech materials from core annotated data, andinvestigated its features of pitch and duration atboundary (Zou et al 2010).
The detailed dataare shown in table 3 and 4 respectively.BoundariesTypes Marker N Mean SDPW /1 or/1+ 118 65.2 61.714PP /2 659 97.6 84.140C-PP /2* 193 108.7 82.483IP /3 877 343.2 138.906IG /4 375 699.2 254.287MEC /5 31 771.0 208.580Table 4: The mean of silent pause duration atboundaries.There are two ways of representation to pitchfeature at prosodic boundary: Firstly, the pitchcontour is un-continuity; secondly, the pitchresetting of the declination contour (de Pijper etal 1994).
According to Table 3, we can find thatthere is a few resetting of bottom pitch value atPW boundary, that is to say, the bottom of thePW boundary right is 1.4 semitones higher thanthat of its left.
At other boundaries, the bottompitch values at right side are much higher thanthat at left side, for instance, there is 3.1, 5.2,9.9, 11.3 and 13.6 semitones resetting from PPto MEC boundary successively.
Especially, atthe IP boundary its resetting has about twotimes than that of C-PP boundary.
This showsthat there are very obvious prosodic feature atvarious boundaries in broadcasting news speech.Generally, we know that 90ms is the floor ofthreshold for perceiving the silent pause.
FromTable 4, the mean of silent pause duration fromlong to short followed by MEC > IG > IP > C-PP > PP > PW.
Except there is no perceivedsilent pause at PW boundary, the other bounda-ries have obvious silent pause that can be per-ceived.
The length of silent pause at PP and C-PP are 97.6ms and 108.7ms respectively, andthe length at IP has over three times longer thanthat at C-PP.
According to this, we propose thatthe PP and C-PP lie in the same position at theprosodic hierarchical structure, and the C-PP isa special prosodic phrase.From our core data we got 6728 C-PPs.
Ac-cording to the C-PP that contains the number ofPW, we divided them into four categories, suchas three-PW, four-PW, five-PW and six-PW.The distribution of them is shown in Table 5.After preliminary analysis we found that theC-PP, which contains three PWs, has a simplesyntactic structure although it is absolute major-ity in the number, and that is compose of fourPWs should be done for correlations of prosodyand syntax.
There are about 6 types of prosodicstructure if the C-PP contains four PWs.
Thedetail data of this type C-PP followed in table 6.From the data, we know that the fourth type,which is (A+B) +(C+D), is the most, and that iscomposed by (A+B) +C+D is the least in all ofthe six types.
Although there are just six typesof prosodic structure that can be found, there aremore than 985 syntactic categories in this 1835C-PPs.
There are 23 types which occur morethan 10 times, and most of them occur only onetime.
To some extent, it can explain that thesyntactic structure is more complex than theprosodic one.An example of prosodic and syntactic struc-tures in the utterance, which is ou1 yang2 yu3hang2 yi4 zhi1 shou3 jin3 jin0 bao4 zhu4 lou2ti1 de0 lan2 gan1 (Ouyang Yuhang held fast tothe staircase railing with one hand), is given infigure 1.
The left side of figure is the prosodicstructure, and the syntactic one lies at the rightside.In figure 1, there is a little difference of jin3jin0 bao4 zhu4 lou2 ti1 de0 lan2 gan1 (?????????)

and its syntactic structure ?

In this utterance, there is a nestingstructure at jin3 jin0 bao4 zhu4 lou2 ti1 de0lan2 gan1 (held fast to the staircase railing)based on the length of perceived silent pause.Furthermore, the pitch declination trend withinthe C-PP is obvious despite small resetting be-tween zhu4 and lou2.
So we suggest that there isa stable prosodic pattern within a C-PP inbroadcasting news speech.Conversely, what is the correlation betweenthe prosody and syntax?
From above analysis,we know that the conjunction and particle, suchas?
(de0), ?(deng3),?
(he2), ?
(dan4) and soon, more likely attached to the end of left struc-ture or the beginning of right one and form aprosodic word.
If it has just four lexical wordsincluding the conjunction or particle they form aprosodic word by itself.
That is to say, it hasvery great flexibility in prosodic structures forconjunctions and particles, such as ?

and so on.4.2 Diachronic Comparative Phonetic andProsodic Analysis in Movie DialoguesWhich diachronic phonetic changes happened inMandarin by the past 100 years?
We also ana-lyze and compare the phonetic features of Chi-nese Mandarin among several same-name mov-ies in different historical eras from CMDMC(Wang et al 2010).
In order to minimize thedivergence of the variables and maximize thereliability of conclusions, we chose two pairs ofsame-name movies screened in different histori-cal periods.
These movies are: Pingyuan Youji-dui (The Plains Guerrillas) shot in 1955 and1975, Dujiang Zhencha Ji (Reconnaissanceacross the Yangtze River) shot in 1954 and 1974respectively.Pitch Feature: In the analysis of pitch, weput aside the stresses and the neutral tone syl-lables, and make the statistical investigations onthe top pitch value and the bottom pitch value ofthe syllables.Figure 3: The pitch data of 1955 and 1975 ver-sion in the Plains Guerrillas.
The fundamentalfrequency also was normalized by semitones;the male?s reference frequency is 50Hz.Figure 3 shows that the mean of the top pitchvalue in the 1950s?
materials is lower than thatof 1970s?.
In the 1955 version, the leading cha-racter, Speaker A, possesses a mean value of thetop pitch value which is 20.9 semitones.
Thisvalue is lower than that of 1975s?
by a differ-ence of 0.9 semitones.
The negative character,Speaker B, has a mean value of the top pitchvalue which is 24.5 semitones in the 1955 ver-sion.
The value in the 1975 version is 27 semi-tones, with a difference of 2.5 semitones left,also showing that the value in the 1975 versionis comparatively high.
Comparing the data ofthe bottom pitch value in the 1955 version withthat in the 1975 version, we know that thesedata seem closer than the top pitch value, butstill the higher ones belong to the 1975 version.That the bottom pitch value is higher tells usthat the whole pitch register is raised.Furthermore, we can easily see from Figure 3that the pitch range of the same character in the1975 version is wider.
Speaker A of the 1955version has a pitch range of 4.8 semitones.
Incontrast, the same character in the 1975 versionhas a pitch range of 6 semitones.
Speaker C ofthe 1955 version has 4 semitones pitch range,but in the 1975 version, he has 5.9 semitonespitch range.
The gap between them is 1.9 semi-tones.
Through this comparison, we find that thepitch range in the 1975 version is wider thanthat in the 1955 version in the whole.To some extent, the speaking, both the toppitch value and the bottom pitch value in the1975 version are higher.
This proves that, on thewhole, the pitch of the 1970s?
materials is high-er and more unnatural than that of 50s?
becauseof the effect by the Cultural Revolution era.And this also proves the feeling of the partici-pants in the perceptional experiment at section 3about the 1970s?
materials, that is, the 1970s?Mandarin has a loud and sonorous voice; thecharacters pronounce harder; the general pitch ishigher.Duration feature: In the respect of duration,we also compared and analyzed the presenters?speech on TV in 20053According to table 7, there is a little differ-ence of the durations mean among them (fol-lowing four tones), especially it?s very closelybetween the 1975 and the 2005, and those of the1975 version are a few longer than those of the1955 version.
But, except the first tone (Sig.=.077), the differences of the duration meansbetween the others, which is in the 1955, thewith the materials ex-tracted from the movie dialogues the 1955 andthe 1975.
Table 7 is the relevant data.3 In this work, we just chose the male?s speech datafrom Zou (2007).1975 and the 2005, are significant (Sig.=.000, .000, .002?.05 respectively).mean SD NMovie:1955 T1 153.6 69.5 243T2 136.8 58.1 242T3 132.8 58.7 321T4 133.5 52.0 539Movie:1975 T1 177.8 72.1 258T2 155.5 52.0 263T3 152.5 57.6 289T4 156.7 59.9 505TV: 2005 T1 163.1 65.7 1471T2 156.0 66.5 1743T3 156.8 67.6 1054T4 145.9 62.3 2652Table 7: The duration mean of four tones inmovie dialogues (1955 and 1975) vs. that ofpresenters?
spoken language on TV in 2005(ms).Demonstrations of the four-syllable pro-sodic words: The comparative pitch contour oftwo four-syllable prosodic words, which are?bu2 yao4 lu4 mian4?
(don?t appear) and ?gan4shen2 me0 de0?
(What are you doing?
), areshown in Figure 4 and 5, respectively.Figure 4: The pitch contour of ?bu2 yao4 lu4mian4?
(don?t appear)Figure 5: The pitch contour of ?gan4 shen2 me0de0?
(What are you doing?
)By observing the above two figures, we findthat the pitch contour of the 1975 and that of the1955 are almost identical except the latter isalways lower than the former.
This may explainthat although the Mandarin has gone through ahundred years, the pitch pattern is relativelystable.5 Conclusions and Future WorkThis paper proposes to design a ChineseMandarin Digital Multi-modal Corpus(CMDMC).
Through this corpus, the historicaltrace of Mandarin development can be followed;the fresh and alive data and material resourcescan be drawn up for the modern researchers andsuccessors.
We also intend to analyze the syn-tactic correlations of prosodic phrase in broad-casting news speech, and compare the phoneticand prosodic features in movie dialogues amongseveral same-name movies in different histori-cal eras.
The contributions are as follows.Firstly, the syntactic structure is more com-plex than the prosodic structure, some conjunc-tion and particle, such as de0, deng3, he2, dan4and so on, more likely attached to the end of leftstructure or the beginning of right one and forma prosodic word, if the number of lexical wordsmismatch the prosodic words.
Otherwise, theyhave almost similar structure.Secondly, the speech of 1970s in last centuryis greatly influenced by the special era.
Peopleusually use exaggerated voice, pronounce hardand raise the pitch unnaturally, giving others ataste of lecturing and ordering.
In contrast, thespeech of Mandarin in 1950s is more naturaland close to the daily life pronunciation andintonation.
Even so, the pitch patterns have nobig changes, and this may explain that the pitchpatterns are comparatively stable in ChineseMandarin.Future research will include treatment of cor-relation between syntax and prosody within IPor IG, ideally comparing the diachronic phonet-ic or prosodic changes in Mandarin by the past100 years.
Additionally, we would like to tacklethe problem of data management, update andperiodical increasing as time passes.6 AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Department ofScience and Technology at Ministry of Educa-tion (No.
