The api~roach out1~ed below is to be understood as a compo-nent of a more general method of semantic interpretat ion of natu-ral languages,Roughly spea~.ing th~s method (develor~.e6 in my forthcomingElements of a Sem~.ntic Theor~r of }T~tur~J Lan6u~es)  might be cha-racterized, as fol\].ows:I ?.

hors_~e, RU is a predicate constant which is a translat ion of~.
It is obvious that a translation like (4) does not account~^~ of  ~,r  .... tense the verb.~n order to be able to represent in our semantic ~ystem the tez.~c ~t inc t ion  from natural languages, we take the fol\]ov-ing way:~o.
Ue shall transform our earl ier system S: into a eoordi-~te  ~,au'~a_~ (in t1~e sense of Carnap's, Introduction .... , i~p.
161-171; tee also Carnap, ~eanin~ and Necessity, 196o, pp.
7~,-75).The individual expressions in st.andard form are referr:oir~ to '~fos~tions' in an ordered domain.
An expression like 'a ~- 'Jv'ou\]~ ~esignate the 'l~osition i' at the 'time j'.For our further discussion is enough to interpret each-34locat ion '~"4, ~"  ..__a\[' as different "things' in the universe, anda ~.
.
.a  ~' as different "locations" ezch expression of the form 'al, --& "~in time of the same "thing".
The expression 'a ~' has to be inter~ --@preted as designsJting a thing with no respect to its "time loca-tion"; in other words such an expression is to be understood asreferr ing to a thir~ "abstracted" from time, or - what iz thesnme for us - being in any time.
The expression i refers to the"empty" posit ion or to the "nul\]-thing".
The number of the "posi-t ions" is, perhaps, unfinite.2 ?

It is \]~u~own that, as far as~ the natural languages are con-ccrned, the category of tense could be roughly defined as there lat ion between the time of the action (,expressed by the verb):~nd the time when the message is uttered; that?
is to say the pre-rent "expresses" the simultaneity with the time the message isuttered, the ~osst expresses the anter ior i ty with respect to thetime of the message an8 the future expresses the ~oster ior i ty:-Jth respect to the time of the message.T~.J.s use of def ining tenses suggests the fol\]owing treatmentof tense estegory in terms of our semantic system:\].o.
The time of the message is to be represented by anyv,~.._!ue of ~ from the expression 's~'.2 ?
.
If x is the 'thing' referred to  by an individual desc-~5pt~'on, then an expression like 'SIT~a~ .'
expresses exactly therel~=.t~on of the 'thing' referred to by t~e varmable x and the?
time of the message" expressed by 'a~'.
That is, 'SI~.Z~a.

\[(H0x ~Ixy) @ RUy ~0~xa~ 3Obviously (4a) is the translat ion for the ~-resent version, (4b)- for thep~ast vers'ion, (4c) - for the future version.Letus  suppose that, in the'state of ~ffs, irs t referred to byour expressions, the only thing having the ~roperty 'horse' is thething being in the point 'a6~;o let us consider further 'a~'Irepre -senting the 'time of the message'.
In this case, if we put 'a#'instead of ~, we may say thatis true; moreover, (4a) is factua~l~ true.If the posit ion referred to by a ~ does not have actual ly thr- -0propert ies  predicated by (4a5 or if there are seve___ral posit ionshaving the properties predicated by (as!).

"~The intuitive interpretat ion of the L-falsehood of these exPressions ~ns  c~s follows: for instance (4a") says that a past event~n ni~=~O_taneous with the time of the message; ,sentence (4a") says~.turethat a - event ,  "tlt:,t is an event which is not yet oceuring in the time of the messa-ce is s imultaneous with the time of the message.

The above Troposed interpretat ion may account also for some",~.bl~T~o_es of the natural langu~ges.
We shall ta\]re an examplefl-o~, other lan~uage t~an English, which makes a dist inct ion ,bet-"::een the 'pure present' and the "irogressive present".
For ~nstan-ee, in French the sentence:(\]5) Le ehien cui dor~, mange beaucoup.nig~ht be int~:rpreted as saying that:(15a) the dog ~ and eats at the time ~vhen the mes-,sage is uttered(15b) the dog s leeps  at the time when the message isuttered and in c~eneral eats (much).Obviously interpretat ion (15a) chars~cterizes (15) as L-felse,(15h) ~-s possibly F-true.Thir: s i tuat ion can be accounted for by supplementing the tran~\ ]~t~n ~.1\]e (14) with the fol lowing statement:(14a) RepZace the symbol Prez by :(~) S I~xa~or by(N sn~a"~es-7 -The underlying structure of (15) is represented by the senten-(15~) Le chien dors.
(15~ Le chien man~e (beaucoup).
(We sb~ll disregard the word beaucou~, because it is ~rrelevantfor our disc~ssicn.
)Let 'CH'~, 'DO, ~r.d '1~t~' be the predicates by which chien, __d?r-N:~ir nnd ~ ~rc to be translated in S~ ~nd 'a I' the time of themessage.
The tr~.~slation of (15~,l~o~ wfil\] be, resi.ectively:YAye Sl~?\[xa~\]Let u~' consider S~, accounting for French, has a mea_~ing postu-late saying predicates 'DO' n~ 'ITA' are incompatible simultaneous\]y.Obviously, in t\]'.is c~se the c_lass comprising sentences (15~L',~,I) it: inconsistent, or: the conjsnct~on of (15g') and (15~') isL-false.If we choose the other ~o~ib \ ]e  tr~.nslation, i.e.
(i5~)Then the class coml-.rising (15~#, ~") can be ~o~sibly F-true and.so can be their corresponSing conjunction.Translations (15~', ~'~ account for tl~e 'meaning' (15a); tr~tns-Sations (15~ ~, ~") account for the r~eaning (15b).It is easy to see that the fccts nccounted for in ~ are of pu-rely semantic nature, in contradistinction with the merely pragma-tic nature of the facts accounted for in 4.
In the former case on-ly the 'meaning' of the expressions 'CHx', 'DOx', '~Ax' an~'SIK'xa~' is involved, whereas in the cases under 4 we h~ve had todo with various possibilities of "referrfing,, be J~ at the ~isposal"of the speaker.
