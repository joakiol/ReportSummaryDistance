Design and Enhanced Evaluation of aRobust Anaphor Resolution AlgorithmRoland Stuckardt*Knowbotic Systems GmbH & Co. KGSyntactic coindexing restrictions are by now known to be of central importance to practicalanaphor esolution approaches.
Since, in particular due to structural ambiguity, the assumptionof the availability of a unique syntactic reading proves to be unrealistic, robust anaphor esolutionrelies on techniques to overcome this deficiency.This paper describes the ROSANA approach, which generalizes the verification of coindexingrestrictions in order to make it applicable to the deficient syntactic descriptions that are providedby a robust state-of-the-art parser.
By a formal evaluation on two corpora that differ with respectto text genre and domain, it is shown that ROSANA achieves high-quality robust coreferenceresolution.
Moreover, by an in-depth analysis, it is proven that the robust implementation ofsyntactic disjoint reference isnearly optimal.
The study reveals that, compared with approachesthat rely on shallow preprocessing, the largely nonheuristic disjoint reference algorithmizationopens up the possibility/or a slight improvement.
Furthermore, it is shown that more significantgains are to be expected elsewhere, particularly from a text-genre-specific choice of preferencestrategies.The performance study of the ROSANA system crucially rests on an enhanced evaluationmethodology for coreference r solution systems, the development ofwhich constitutes the secondmajor contribution o/the paper.
As a supplement tothe model-theoretic scoring scheme that wasdeveloped for the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) evaluations, additional evaluationmeasures are defined that, on one hand, support he developer of anaphor esolution systems, and,on the other hand, shed light on application aspects of pronoun interpretation.1.
In t roduct ionThe interpretation of anaphoric expressions i known to be a difficult problem.
Inprinciple, a variety of constraints and preference heuristics, including factors that relyon semantic, pragmatic, and world knowledge, contribute to this task (Carbonell andBrown 1988).
Robust, operational approaches to anaphor esolution on unrestricteddiscourse, however, are confined to strategies exploiting globally available evidencelike morphosyntactic, syntactic, and surface information.Beginning with the pioneering work of Hobbs (1978), many practical approachesrely on the availability of syntactic surface structure by employing coindexing re-strictions, salience criteria, and parallelism heuristics (e.g., Lappin and Leass 1994).However, even the assumption of the availability of a unique syntactic description isunrealistic since, in general, parsing involves the solution of difficult problems like at-?

Basedon this observation, Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) have suggested an adaptation ofLappin and Leass's approach to the shallow analysis frontend of English ConstraintGrammar (Karlsson et al 1995), which provides a part-of-speech tagging compris-ing an assignment of syntactic function but no constituent s ructure.
This informationdeficiency is partly overcome by the application of a regular filter that heuristicallyreconstructs parts of the constituent s ructure.
An alternative solution, which is basedon the possibly partial but potentially more comprehensive and reliable output of aconventional parser, has been suggested in Stuckardt (1997).In the present paper, an approach to robust anaphor esolution is developed thatenhances the latter work.
The coreference r solution algorithm ROSANA l is devel-oped, the core of which consists of a set of rule patterns by means of which theverification of disjoint reference rules is generalized in order to make it applicable todeficient (fragmentary) syntactic descriptions.
Based on this algorithm, the ROSANAsystem, which works on the partial syntactic descriptions generated by the robustFDG (Functional Dependency Grammar of English) parser of J~irvinen and Tapanainen(1997), is implemented.
By a formal evaluation on two text corpora that differ withrespect to genre and domain, it is proven that ROSANA achieves robust (truly opera-tional) high-quality coreference r solution on unrestricted texts.
An in-depth analysisshows that the robust implementation f syntactic disjoint reference is nearly opti-mal.
Compared with approaches that rely on a combination of shallow preprocess-ing and heuristic syntactic disjoint reference, the largely nonheuristic disjoint refer-ence algorithmization employed by ROSANA opens up the possibility for a slightimprovement.The performance study of the ROSANA system crucially rests on an enhancementof the evaluation methodology for coreference r solution systems, the developmentof which constitutes the second major contribution of the paper.
As a supplement tothe coreference class scoring scheme that was developed for the CO-task evaluationof the Message Understanding Conferences (Vilain et al 1996), two additional eval-uation disciplines are defined that, on one hand, aim at supporting the developer ofanaphor esolution systems, and, on the other hand, shed light on application aspects ofpronoun interpretation.
The evaluation of ROSANA according to the refined scoringscheme gives evidence that the interpretation quality may be improved by a genre-specific choice of the preference factors and their relative weights.
This demonstratesthe usefulness of enhancing the evaluation methodology for coreference r solutionsystems.The paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, the robustness i sue of naturallanguage processing is briefly discussed at a general level, and two models of robustanaphor esolution are introduced.
In Section 3, by deriving a set of disjoint refer-ence rule patterns for fragmentary s ntax, the core component of a robust, operationalanaphor esolution algorithm is developed.
In Section 4, the ROSANA algorithm isdesigned, and an implementation, the ROSANA system, is described.
In Section 5,an enhanced set of evaluation disciplines for coreference r solution systems is advo-cated for, and the respective formal measures are defined.
In Section 6, the evaluationresults of ROSANA are discussed.
Finally, in section 7, ROSANA is compared withother approaches to anaphor esolution and, in particular, robust syntactic disjointreference.1 ROSANA = Robust Syntax-Based Interpretation of Anaphoric Expressions480Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution Algorithm2.
Anaphor Resolution and the Robustness Issue2.1 Robustness in Natural Language ProcessingIn natural language processing in general, the robustness i sue comprises the ability ofa software system to cope with input that gives rise to deficient descriptions at somedescriptive layer.
2More or less implicit is the assumption that the system exhibits omekind of monotonic behavior: the less deficient he description, the higher the quality ofthe output (Menzel 1995).Following Menzel further, this intuitive characterization may be refined.
The pro-cessing should exhibit autonomy in the sense that complete failures at one stage ofanalysis hould not cause complete failures at other stages of analysis or even a fail-ure of the overall processing.
Moreover, the processing model should ideally employsome kind of interaction between different stages of analysis: deficiency at one stageof analysis hould be compensated by evidence gained at other stages.2.2 Two Models of Robust Anaphor ResolutionIn light of the above characterization, the robustness requirement for the anaphorresolution task may be rendered more precisely.
In the aforementioned operationalapproaches, a sequential processing model is followed according to which anaphor resolu-tion is performed by referring to the result of an already completed syntactic analysis.
Un-der this architecture, vidence for structural disambiguation that may be contributedby strong expectations at the referential layer is not taken into account (Stuckardt1996).
In terms of the general goals of robust processing, since there is no interac-tion, this implies that the robustness requirement only shows up in the form of themonotonicity and autonomy demands: the anaphor esolution module has to copewith deficient or shallow syntactic information.
Besides the trivial way of achievingthis kind of robustness by simply not exploiting deficient syntactic descriptions, thefollowing two models may be employed:the shallow description model: by employing heuristic rules to partiallyreconstruct the syntactic description, the anaphor esolution strategiesare adapted to shallow input data that are never defective; 3the deficient description model: by extending anaphor esolutionstrategies to work on a possibly ambiguous or incomplete description,syntactic evidence isexploited as far as available.In contrast to the approach of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), which follows the shallowdescription model, the ROSANA algorithm is based on the deficient description model.In principle, even a "complete" algorithm that establishes the conceptually superiordegree of robustness by means of interaction between structural disambiguation andanaphor esolution is feasible (Stuckardt 1997).
As will become vident, however, thetechnically less complex sequential strategy employed by ROSANA already yieldshigh-quality results and does not leave much room for further improvement.2 The deficiency may result either because the input itself is deficient or from shortcomings of theprocessing resources (e.g., lexicon, grammar/parser, o  semantic/pragmatic d sambiguation).3 Here, the monotonicity demand of intuitive robustness virtually vanishes, since there is no longer asyntactic input prone to deficiency.481Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 42.3 Fragmentary SyntaxThe main phenomena that give rise to structural ambiguity of syntactic descriptionsare uncertainty of syntactic function (involving subject and direct object) and attachmentambiguities of prepositional phrases, relative clauses, and adverbial clauses.
In example(1),(1) Peter observed the man with the telescope.depending on the availability of disambiguating information, it may be uncertainwhether the underlined prepositional phrase with the telescope should be interpretedadverbially or attributively.
From the configurational perspective, these ambiguitiesgive rise to fragmentary syntactic descriptions that consist of several tree-shapedcomponents.
With the exception of the topmost ree fragment, all components cor-respond to a constituent of type PP, S, or NP whose attachment or role assignmentfailed.In addition, cases in which no reading exists give rise to fragmentary syntactic de-scriptions comprising the constituents whose combination failed due to constraintviolation.2.4 Fragmentary Syntax and Anaphor ResolutionAmong the anaphor esolution strategies potentially affected by fragmentary syntaxare both heuristics and constraints.
Preference criteria like salience factors and syntacticparallelism are not affected by all types of syntactic defects.
Moreover, there are manyheuristics that do not rely on syntactic function or structure.
Structural coindexingconstraints, however, may lose evidence in all the above cases of fragmentary syntax.Since they are known to be of central importance to the antecedent-filtering phase ofoperational anaphor esolution approaches, the subsequent discussion focuses on theimpact of deficient surface structure description on disjoint reference restrictions.By referring to Chomsky's Government and Binding (GB) Theory, the core of thesyntactic oindexing restrictions may be stated as follows (Chomsky 1981): 4DefinitionBinding principles A, B, and C:(A) A reflexive or reciprocal is bound in its binding category.
(B) A pronoun is free (i.e., not bound) in its binding category.
(C) A referring expression 3 is free in any domain.where binding category denotes the next surface-structural dominator containingsome kind of subject, and binding is defined as coindexed and c-commanding:4 Various theoretical models that cover disjoint reference phenomena h ve been stated.
Since the disjointreference onditions are descriptive principles of grammar, the choice of the theoretical model is, in thissense, arbitrary.
In the subsequent discussion, the comprehensive and widely known GB Theory isreferred to.5 For example, common ouns and names.482Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution AlgorithmDefinitionSurface structure node X c-commands node Y if and only if the next branching node thatdominates X also dominates Y and it is not the case that X dominates Y, Y dominatesX, or X = Y.The following examples illustrate the scope of the binding principles:(2) a.
The barber/is having himselfi/*himi.b.
The client/wants that the barberj shaves ,himselfi/himi.c.
,The client/wants that the barberj shaves the client/.In sentence (2a), whereas the reflexive himself is required to be coindexed with the localsubject he barber (binding principle A), coindexing the pronoun him with the subjectis ruled out (binding principle B) because, otherwise, the pronoun would be locallybound in its binding category.
Sentence (2b) illustrates the case of nonlocal binding(here: outside the embedded sentence), which is admissible only in the case of thenonreflexive pronoun.
As illustrated by sentence (2c) and modeled by binding princi-ple C, referring expressions (e.g., common nouns and names) are not even allowed tobe bound nonlocally.A further structural well-formedness condition, commonly called the i-within-i condition, aims at ruling out certain instances of referential circularity, that is, coin-dexings matching the pattern \[c~ ... \[fl...\]i\]i (Chomsky 1981, page 212).
It is motivatedby cases like (3):(3) *Mary knows \[the owner of hisi boat\]/.The following example illustrates that syntactic fragmentation may interfere with theapplication of syntactic disjoint reference conditions:(4) Peter observed the owner of the telescope with it.In (4), the i-within-i condition possibly applies: 6 the coindexing of telescope and it isadmissible only if the PP containing it is not interpreted as an attribute to telescope--otherwise, in violation of the i-within-i condition, the pronoun would be containedin the NP of the tentative antecedent.
Hence, if the PP attachment ambiguity has not6 Since the (maximal projection of the) NP with head telescope dominates the NP of it, the former NPdoes not c-command the latter.
Hence, coindexing the two NPs does not induce a relation of (local)binding, which implies that binding principle B does not apply in this case.If one assumes the applicability of the i-within-i condition defined as above, however, there are twoclasses of cases that do not seem to be appropriately distinguished:(i) Peter observed the owner of \[the telescope near itsi factory\]/.
(ii) *Peter destroyed \[a picture of its/frame\]i.Whereas in (i), where the possessive occurs in an adjunct phrase of the telescope NP, coindexing may bejudged admissible, in (ii), where the possessive occurs in a complement phrase, coindexing seems to beinadmissible.
If, however, the scope of the i-within-i condition were restricted to the complement cases(ii), then, since binding principle B does not apply, case (4) would remain unaccounted for.
Whereas, intheory, it is widely agreed that the original definition of the i-within-i condition may be somewhat oostrong (e.g., Chomsky 1981, page 212), with respect o the practical task of robust anaphor resolution,as the formal evaluations below will demonstrate, the original i-within-i condition is sufficient.
Incorpora, cases like (i) seem to be exceptional.483Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4been resolved prior to anaphor esolution, the fragmentary syntactic description doesnot contribute the configurational evidence necessary for definitely confirming theantecedent candidate telescope.3.
Checking Binding Constraints on Fragmentary Syntax3.1 Basic ObservationsThe first step toward the verification of binding constraints on fragmentary syntax issuggested by the following observation: if both the anaphor and the antecedent candidate arecontained in the same connected component of the fragmentary s ntactic description, o (direct)binding-theoretic evidence is lost.
In this case, it will be possible to verify the bindingrestrictions of anaphor and antecedent in a nonheuristic manner, since the necessarypositive (--* binding principle A) and negative (---+ binding principles B, C) syntactic-configurational evidence is entirely available.
7 However, even in the disadvantageouscase in which the anaphor and the antecedent candidate occur in different surfacestructure fragments, a closer look at the fragments may reveal additional information.3.2 An ExampleThe following example illustrates a typical case: 8(5) Der Mann hat den Pr~isidenten besucht, der ihn von sich i~berzeugte.the man has the president visited who him of himself convinced'The man visited the president who convinced him of himself.
'Because of the intervening past participle, the relative clause may be interpreted as anattribute to either Mann or Pr~sidenten.
Hence, syntactic ambiguity arises, yielding asurface structure description that consists of the following two fragments: 9(S Mann(VP Pr~sidenten) )(S der(VP ihn(VP (PP sich))))In addition, it is known that the second fragment is embedded in the first.
Thereare three pronominal anaphors to be resolved: the reflexive pronoun sich of binding-theoretic type A, the nonreflexive pronoun ihn of type B, and the relative pronoun derof type B.Regarding the reflexive pronoun sich, it can be shown that binding-theoretic ev-idence is completely available.
Clearly, this holds with respect o the candidates derand ihn, which are contained in the same surface structure fragment.
However, evenregarding the two candidates Mann and Prf~sidenten that occur in the other fragment,there is no loss of evidence: since the reflexive pronoun is of binding-theoretic type A,and the fragment in which it occurs contains its binding category (the S node of the7 However, this statement applies olely to the direct comparison ofthe involved occurrences, since incase of further, transitive coindexings, negative evidence stemming from decision interdependency mayget lost (cf.
Section 4.1).8 The example isgiven in German because the structural mbiguity emerges more strikingly.9 For the sake of readability, parts of the constituent structure are omitted.484Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution Algorithmrelative clause), according to binding principle A both candidates may be definitivelyruled out.Similar observations can be made regarding the pronouns ihn and der, for whichbinding principle B applies: the two candidates Mann and Priisidenten are recognizedas configurationally admissible.
In this case, besides the binding category condition, itis decisive that their fragment is known to be embedded in the antecedent's fragments.
1?3.3 Rule PatternsIn the subsequent discussion, pairs of anaphors a and antecedent candidates 3' areconsidered that occur in different surface syntactic fragments.
The goal is to determinewhether coindexing a and 3' (as in the case of actually choosing 3' as the antecedentof a) complies with the above-stated binding-theoretic conditions.
Since, according tothe definition of the binding principles, no asymmetric distinction between anaphorand candidate is drawn, the disjoint reference requirements of both a and 3' must  betaken into account.By an abstraction over cases like the ones discussed in Section 3.2, a set of rule pat-terns can be designed by means of which the verification of syntactic disjoint referenceis generalized in order to make it applicable to f ragmentary syntactic descriptions (cf.Figure 1).
11 As illustrated by example (5), there are two classes of patterns.
12 One class(five patterns, labeled " , " )  matches cases in which, according to the binding princi-ples, coindexing the anaphor a and the antecedent candidate 3' is ruled out; the otherclass (three patterns, labeled "v/ ' )  applies in certain cases where no binding principleis violated and coindexing is therefore admissible.
By the binding principles, conditionsregarding, on one hand, the presence or absence of a c-command relation, and, on theother hand, the locality or nonlocality of this relation, are stated.
The rule patterns aredesigned to match fragmentary cases in which at least one condition of either anaphoror candidate is violated (" , "  patterns), or cases in which all conditions of anaphor andcandidate are satisfied ("v/" patterns).
Figure 2 explicates the specific conditions thedifferent patterns aim at.
Three patterns apply in certain cases of binding principle Aviolation (\[E2\]: missing locality; \[E4\]: missing c-command relation; \[F2\]: either miss-ing locality or missing c-command relation).
Another two patterns cover instances ofbinding principle C violation (\[E3a\], \[E3b\]: c -command relation).
Three other patternsmatch cases of binding principle B satisfaction (IF1\], \[Ela\], \[Elb\]: nonlocality).This collection of rules may be supplemented with further patterns employingmore sophisticated conditions regarding the fragments to be matched.
13 The actualchoice of rule patterns, however, should depend on the parser that is used.
As will10 It is evident hat there are cases in which the latter condition does not hold and the coindexing wouldviolate binding principle C.11 The following notational conventions are used: round brackets delimit constituents; square bracketsemphasize fragment boundaries; bc(X) denotes the binding category of surface structure node X; bn(X)denotes the branching node dominating X according to the c-command definition; the subscript ofXtype y denotes that the binding-theoretic class of the occurrence contributed by X is Y C {A, B, C}; forexample, PtypeB is a pronoun.
~//* indicate the prediction of the particular pattern, that is, whether, instructural configurations matching the pattern, coindexing isadmissible or ruled out.12 Example (5) illustrates an instance of syntactic fragmentation that is due to structural ambiguity.
Therule patterns, however, are general in the sense that they also cover cases of fragmentary s ntacticdescription that are induced by parsing constraint violation (cf.
Section 2.3).13 For example, patterns may be added that match instances of binding principle B violation, that is, cases inwhich one occurrence oftype B is locally c-commanded bythe other occurrence.
To recognize such cases,two conditions must be verified, one requiring that one occurrence c-command the other (of type B)regardless of the attachment choice, the other requiring that the fragment of the latter occurrence notcontain the occurrence's binding category.
Similar conditions may be employed for recognizinginstances of binding principle A satisfaction.485Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4\[F1\] ,/IF2\] *\[Ela\] x/\[Elb\] ,/\[E2\] *\[E3a\] *\[E3b\] *\[E4\] *({(({.

of arbitrary binding-theoretic type (A, B,or C) that occurs in a different fragment containing its branching node (bn) may beruled out on configurational grounds since it is impossible to structurally conjoin thetwo fragments in such a way that % as required by binding principle A of ~, locallybinds c~.
Here, the condition that the binding category be present in the anaphor'sfragment ensures that, in case this fragment is subordinated under the candidate'sfragment, no relation of local binding holds; on the other hand, the condition that thebranching node be present in the candidate's fragment rules out, in the opposite case,the possibility of establishing a c-command relation.
IF2\] is applicable in the case ofexample (5).
Since the relative clause contains a reflexive pronoun (taken as anaphor~) and the respective binding category, it matches the fragment Fj; similarly, the mainclause instantiates Fi with respect o any of its type C occurrences (taken as candidates"~).
Hence, according to the prediction of \[F2\], the immediate, constructive TM coindexingof the reflexive pronoun with any of the candidates occurring in the main clause isruled out.For certain adjacent syntactic fragments, the parsing result may comprise addi-tional information about immediate or transitive mbedding.

If the fragment of the type B anaphoris subordinated, coindexing with an outside candidate ,~ (here: arbitrarily of typeA, B, or C) is admissible.
If, on the other hand, the fragment of the type B (or typeC) anaphor ~ is known to be the dominator, a candidate ~ of type B that occurs ina fragment containing its binding category is configurationally permitted, is Hence,because of the additionally available embedding information, it is possible to relaxthe demands on the dominating fragment, which is no longer required to containthe binding category of the respective occurrence.
Typical cases in which \[Ela\] and\[Elb\] apply are instances of structurally ambiguous relative clauses.
In example (5),since the (embedded) relative clause fragment contains the binding category of thenonreflexive (type B) pronoun occurrences (taken as anaphors ~), fragment Fe of rule\[Ela\] is instantiated; moreover, trivially, the (dominating) main clause instantiates Fa14 While binding principle A constructively demands the existence ofat least one local binder, it does notpreclude further, possibly nonlocal coindexings (cf.
the example in Section 4.1).
In this sense, theapplication of \[F2\] isconfined to the constructive s arch for the antecedent required to fulfill bindingprinciple A.15 In the case of \[Elbl, the anaphor (i.e., the occurrence tobe constructively resolved) occurs in thedominating fragment.
Since 3" cannot be a local binder of c~, the occurrence in the dominating fragmentis not allowed to be of type A (cf.
the remarks on constructive coindexing in footnote 14).
Hence, sincec~ and 3' are not interchangeable, \[Ela\] and \[Elb\] look slightly different.487Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4with respect o any of its (type C) occurrences (taken as candidates 3').

If the type A pronounoccurs in the dominating fragment, and, in addition, the subordinated fragment con-tains the branching node of a constructive candidate 3' of arbitrary binding-theoretictype, this candidate can be ruled out since, in any possible case of structural recombi-nation, 3" will not c-command c~; in particular, this implies that, as required by bindingprinciple A, 3" does not (locally) bind c~.
Since the requirement on the constructivecandidate's fragment is weak, pattern \[E4\] applies in virtually any case in which areflexive pronoun occurs in a dominating fragment.In general, there may be more than one rule pattern applying to a certain configura-tion.
16 However, the set of patterns is consistent in the sense that, whenever this situa-tion arises, the predictions of all applicable rules are identical.There are two further rule patterns that match certain syntactic onfigurations inwhich a coindexing would violate the i-within-i condition (cf.
Figure 3).
Both patternsare abstractions over cases of fragment embedding in which the root of the dominatingfragment constitutes one of the relevant occurrences.
Thus, the scope of the i-within-ipatterns is rather restricted.
As an example, if there is a dominating NP fragment (con-stituting an antecedent candidate 3") and a locally ambiguous PP fragment containingan anaphor a, \[IEa\] rules out coindexing the anaphor's NP with the overall NP.16 For example, \[F2\] as well as \[E2\] in the case of the reflexive pronoun in example (5).488Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution Algorithm\[IEa\] ?

Anaphor Resolution on Fragmentary Syntax: The ROSANA SystemBased on the above set of rule patterns, an anaphor esolution algorithm can be de-signed that achieves robustness against fragmentary syntactic descriptions accordingto the deficient description model.4.1 The ROSANA AlgorithmFigure 4 describes the ROSANA algorithm.
By applying a set of restrictions (Step 1)prior to a set of preferences (Step 2), this algorithm follows Carbonell and Brown's (1988)fundamental strategy by means of which the candidate set is narrowed own as earlyas possible.
In Step 3, the actual selection of antecedents akes place.
Among the strate-gies to be applied are restrictions (e.g., morphosyntactic and lexical congruence, dis-joint reference conditions) and a plethora of preference factors (subject/topicalizationsalience, syntactic obliqueness, recency, cataphor penalty, parallelism \[inertia of syn-tactic function\]).
Since the goal is to design an anaphor esolution algorithm, the choiceis restricted to strategies that are operational.With respect o syntactic disjoint reference, the central goal of robustness againstfragmentary syntax is achieved in Steps l(b) and 3(b).
As described above, if theconsidered occurrences are situated in different syntactic fragments, the rule patternscome into play; the actual set of patterns to be applied depends on whether or notit is known that one of the fragments is embedded in the other.
Patterns labeled ","are used to eliminate candidates (Steps l(b)iv and l(b)v).
Patterns marked "x/" areused to definitively admit candidates (Step l(b)vi), contrasting with heuristic admittance(Step l(b)vii), which entails a decrement of the plausibility score in Step 2(a).One subtlety taken into account is interdependency between different antecedentdecisions (cf.
Step 3).
In particular, decision interdependency may arise because of thetransitivity of the coindexing relation.
As illustrated by the following example, evenregarding intersentential naphora, antecedent decisions that individually comply withthe disjoint reference conditions may collectively induce a violation:(7) *Gropiusi discusses the plans with Behrens/.
Hei meets himi in Dessau.For each of the two pronouns, candidate Gropius is configurationally admissible.
Ina formal sense, however, the binding principles state restrictions on (intrasentential)index distributions rather than on single anaphor-candidate pairs in isolation: in theexample, binding principle B of the pronoun him is transitively violated.
In explicitlychecking for the binding-theoretic admissibility of transitively induced coindexings,the algorithm guards against such cases (Step 3(b)).
However, care must be taken not toapply the binding restriction for reflexives constructively in this test since, as illustratedin the following example, besides demanding constructively one local binder, bindingprinciple A does not rule out further nonlocal coindexings:(8) Gropiusi admits that hei shaves himself/.489Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 41.
Candidate filtering: For each anaphoric NP c~, determine the set of admissibleantecedents 3':(a) verify morphosyntactic or lexical agreement with "y;(b) if the antecedent candidate ~, is intrasentential:?
if c~ and 3' belong to the same syntactic fragment, then verifythati.
the binding restriction of c~ is constructively satisfied,ii.
the binding restriction of 3' is not violated,iii.
no i-within-i configuration results;?
else (c~ and ,y belong to different syntactic fragments) try therule patterns:iv.
if one of the patterns \[E2\], \[E3a\], \[E3b\], \[E4\], or \[F2\] ismatched, then some binding restrictions are violated,v.
else if one of the two i-within-i rule patterns applies,then some binding restrictions are violated,vi.
else if pattern \[Ela\], \[Elb\], or \[F1\] applies,then the binding restrictions of c~ and -y are satisfied,vii.
else (no rule pattern applies) assume heuristicallythat the binding restrictions of c~ and 3' are satisfied;(c) if c~ is a type B pronoun, antecedent candidate 3" is intrasentential, and,with respect o surface order, 3' follows c~, verify that 3' is definite.2.
Candidate scoring and sorting:(a) For each remaining anaphor-candidate pair (c~i,3'j): based on a set ofpreference heuristics, determine the numerical plausibility score v(c~i, 3"j).If the binding-theoretic admissibility was approved heuristically in stepl(b)vii, then reduce the plausibility score v(c~i, 3"j) by a constant value;(b) for each anaphor c~: sort candidates 3"j according to decreasingplausibility v(c~, 3'j);(c) sort the anaphors c~ according to decreasing plausibility of theirrespective best antecedent candidates.3.
Antecedent selection: Consider anaphors c~ in the order determined in Step 2(c).Suggest antecedent candidates -yj(c~) in the order determined in Step 2(b).Select 3"j(c~) as candidate if there is no interdependency, that is, if(a) the morphosyntactic features of c~ and "~j(c~) are still compatible,(b) for all occurrences ~j(~) and 6~ the coindexing of which with 3"j(c~) and(respectively) c~ has been determined in the current invocation of thealgorithm: the coindexing of ~,j(~ and ~,  which results transitivelywhen choosing Vj(c~) as antecedent for c~, violates neither the bindingprinciples nor the i-within-i condition; that is,?
if ~,j/~ and 6~ belong to the same syntactic fragment, then, forboth occurrences, verify the respective binding conditions andthe i-within-i condition according to steps l(b)ii and l(b)iii,?
else if 6~j/~ ) and 6~ belong to different syntactic fragments,then proceed according to steps l(b)iv, l(b)v, l(b)vi, and l(b)vii(with the exception of the rule patterns \[F2\], \[E2\], and \[E4I, bymeans of which binding principle A is constructively verified).
(The case ~,j(~) = ~,j(c~) /~ 6~ = c~ does not need to be reconsidered.
)Figure 4The ROSANA anaphor esolution algorithm.490Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution AlgorithmThe same distinction is drawn in Step l(b): whereas, regarding the anaphor, the bindingrestriction is verified in the strong, constructive sense (Step l(b)i), the candidate'srestriction is applied in its weak version (Step l(b)ii).
In the rule patterns for thefragmentary case, this subtlety is reflected implicitly in the sense that only regardingoccurrence c~ (taken as the anaphor to be constructively resolved) is the strong versionof binding principle A checked; hence, in the interdependency test Step 3(b), patternsIF2\], \[E2\], and \[E4\] are not taken into consideration.4.2 Implementation: The ROSANA SystemBased on the algorithm described in Figure 4, the ROSANA anaphor esolution sys-tem has been implemented (Stuckardt 2000).
In primarily aiming at determining thecoreference classes of nonzero linguistic expressions that specify entities, 17 the scopeof ROSANA corresponds to the coreference task of the Message Understanding Con-ferences (cf.
Hirschman 1998).
ROSANA handles a broad range of entity-specifyingexpressions--in particular, ordinary, possessive, reflexive/reciprocal, nd relative pro-nouns, definite NPs, and names.
The ROSANA system has been implemented in Com-mon Lisp.
In an evaluation on a set of news agency press releases (cf.
Section 6), theruntime of the ROSANA system (without parser) was 165 tokens per second on aPentium PC.The FDG parser for English developed by Jarvinen and Tapanainen (1997) has beenchosen as the syntactic preprocessor, is In giving robustness and processing speed pri-ority over normativity and syntactic overage of the underlying rammar, the parsermeets the requirements on a preprocessor for robust anaphor resolution on unre-stricted texts29 Regardless of the typical parsing problems like structurally ambiguousor grammatically incorrect input, the parser always yields a result, comprising oneor more syntactic fragments that cover the analyzed sentence.
Hence, the parser isregarded to be an ideal associate of robust anaphor esolution approaches that followthe deficient description model.4.3 Anaphoric Occurrences and Antecedent CandidatesIn the ROSANA system, the above algorithm is supplemented by a set of strategies foridentifying occurrences (linguistic expressions that specify entities) and classifying themas anaphors to be resolved and/or  as possible antecedent candidates.
The criterion forthe identification of specifying expressions i based on part of speech (as determinedby the FDG parser) and syntactic ontext (Stuckardt 2000, page 249).
2o Also, the de-cision of anaphoricity is based on evidence regarding the syntactic ontext: generally,occurrences of all three binding-theoretic types (A, B, C) are taken to be anaphoric; 21however, there are some classes of anaphoric occurrences that may, in certain cases,be interpreted in advance (outside the ROSANA core algorithm) by purely structuralmeans (e.g., relative pronouns or occurrences induced by heads of appositions).
Fornarrowing down the search space, occurrences of type A (reflexive and reciprocal pro-17 In contrast to expressions that, for example, specify events.18 Since the parser generates dependency descriptions rather than constituent s ructure (to which theformal definitions of the above GB-theoretic statement ofsyntactic disjoint reference r fer), ROSANAapplies a preprocessor that reconstructs the structural (e.g., subject-object) asymmetries of constituencythat are vital to the verification of the disjoint reference conditions.19 According to J/irvinen and Tapanainen (1997), the FDG parser processes an average of 350 words persecond on modest hardware (Pentium PC, 166 MHz).20 Syntactic context plays a role, for example, indeciding whether the expression her is a possessive ornonpossessive pronoun.21 In the case of nonpronominal NPs, it proves to be difficult o decide algorithmically (e.g., based oninformation about he determiner) whether or not a new discourse referent is introduced.491Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4nouns) are not taken into account as antecedent candidates, ince the existence of acospecifying alternative in the same clause remains guaranteed.4.4 Congruence ConditionsIn Step l(a) of the ROSANA algorithm, the details regarding the congruence restric-tions are left unspecified.
In the ROSANA system, depending on the specific type ofanaphoric expression, different morphosyntactic or lexical agreement conditions areemployed.
For names, for example, a partial matching of the antecedent and anaphorexpressions (in the sense of surname identity) is considered sufficient.
Regarding thirdperson pronouns (including possessives and reflexives/reciprocals), congruence of themorphological features number and person is considered mandatory; however, congru-ence of the gender attribute is taken to be optional, since, on one hand, there are somewell-known exceptions, and, on the other hand, the available grammatical gender in-formation is not always correct.
22 In any case, candidates that also match the genderattribute of the anaphor are preferred.4.5 Salience Factors and WeightsAs in the approaches of Lappin and Leass (1994) and Kennedy and Boguraev (1996),weighted salience factors are employed for scoring and choosing among the candi-dates that remain after restriction application (cf.
Step 2(a) of the ROSANA algorithm).Since the goal is to develop an operational pproach for unrestricted texts, the choice isrestricted to factors relying on information available in the scenario f knowledge-poorprocessing, that is, without extensive semantic domain modeling.In the ROSANA system, the following factors are employed: SYR (contributedby occurrences with identical syntactic function), EEP (occUrrences realized in thesyntactic position of existential emphasis), SUP (syntactic subject), PGP (possessivepronouns, saxonian genitives, and genitive attributes), DOP/IOP/APP (salience ofdirect/indirect objects and adverbial PPs, respectively), KAM (negative preference ofcataphoric resumptions), SDM (sentence recency; i.e., a factor of negative salience tobe multiplied with the sentence distance between anaphor and antecedent), WDM(word recency).
The main part of Table 1 indicates which subset of factors is used forscoring the candidate set of which class of anaphoric expression (DNOM = definiteNP, PER{I,2,3} = first/second/third person pronouns, POS{1,2,3} = first/second/thirdperson possessives, RELA = relative pronouns, REFL = reflexive/reciprocal pronouns).The assignment of the factors and the choice of the weights (shown in the lowerpart of the table) have been determined by a series of refinement experiments on atraining corpus of 31 news agency press releases (11,808 words, 471 pronouns) forwhich key data were provided manually.
As a proper base for the goal-directed re-finement of the factor assignments and weights, the interpretation results were scoredaccording to two of the formal evaluation disciplines that will be defined in Sec-tion 5, namely, determination f coreference classes (model-theoretic scoring) and non-pronominal anchors.
23 The factor/weight relations determined by Lappin and Leass(1994) for third person pronouns were taken as the initial clue.
For the other types ofanaphoric expressions, ets of weighted factors were assigned based on an analysis ofthe referential context of typical occurrences in the training corpus.
For example, the22 This is partly due to lexical ambiguity (homonymy), or  regarding names, due to lack of the respectivelexical information.23 Since, for these disciplines, two-dimensional (precision/recall) measures are defined, there may, ingeneral, be multiple (pareto-)optimal factor/weight assignments.
Instead, one may refer to a combined(weighted) scoring scheme, such as the F measure employed in the MUC evaluations.492Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution AlgorithmTable 1Salience factors and weights for different ypes of anaphoric expressions.Anaphor type SYR EEP SUP PGP DOP IOP APP KAM SDM WDMDNOM + +NAME +PER3 + + + + + + + + +PER2 + + + + + + + + +RELA +POS3 + + + +POS2 + + + +REFLPER1 + + +POS1 + + +Weights 20 15 15 13 10 5 5 125 25 25corpus s tudy  revealed that first person nonpossessive and possessive pronouns  typi-cally resume discourse referents instantiated by nearby antecedents that occur in thesyntactic subject role; consequently, the factors SUP, WDM,  and KAM were chosen.
24Dur ing a series of variation and evaluat ion runs in which some of the factors weresystematical ly deactivated, these initial ass ignments were empir ical ly val idated.
25Finally, a series of experiments with the factor weights were carried out.
Clearly,the absolute size of the weights is irrelevant.
However ,  some condit ions that seem togovern the relative size of the factor weights were determined/conf i rmed dur ing thetraining runs.
For example, in locally vary ing the assigned weights in such a way  thatindividual  > relations of the syntactic funct ion hierarchy SUP > DOP > IOP > APPwere violated (e.g., by  setting SUP = 10 < DOP = 15), it was experimental ly verif iedthat the original weight  relations yield better results.
Further f indings are: SDM >SYR (syntactic parallel ism induces local preferences only); SYR > SUP (if an anaphoroccurs in a syntactic role other than subject, then candidates with that same role arepreferred to candidates in subject role); KAM large (cataphoric resumpt ions are heavi lypenalized).
For the most  part, these results coincide with, or prov ide further supportfor, similar f indings by Lappin and Leass (1994, page 549).
26As table I makes evident, the salience factors proper  (determined by syntactic role)are employed  only in the case of pronomina l  anaphors.
Most  importantly,  there is astriking difference between PER3 and POS3: whereas, in the former case, a hierarchy ofsyntactic roles (i.e., salience factors with decreasing weights) is referred to, in the lattercase, only the factors of subject preference and syntactic parallel ism are employedbecause it turned out that possessive pronouns  tend to cospecify with antecedentsthat are either syntactic subjects or, again, possessive pronouns.
Relative pronouns  areconsidered to be an exception: since, in most  cases, they take their antecedents in thenearest vicinity, the word  recency factor proved to be sufficient.24 Through this preference, cases are accounted for, too, in which appropriate third person antecedentsoccur outside a passage of quoted speech containing the first person pronoun.
In particular, thisrenders possible the determination of nonpronominal anchors (cf.
Section 5.3) for first person pronouns.25 Whereas, in large part, the experiments confirmed the factor assignments for third person pronounssuggested by Lappin and Leass, it turned out that the training corpus did not contain a sufficientnumber of occurrences realized in the syntactic position of existential emphasis for evaluating thecontribution of the EEP factor.
This should be addressed by further experiments on larger corpora.26 One divergence regards the size of the syntactic parallelism factor SYR.
According to the experimentalresults, SYR should be larger than SUP.
However, Lappin and Leass determined that SYR should bejust large enough to offset the preference for subjects over accusative objects, that is, SYR + DOP >SUP.
This issue should be addressed by further experiments.493Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 45.
Enhancing the Evaluation Methodology for Anaphor Resolution SystemsFor a proper evaluation of ROSANA, appropriate valuation measures have to bechosen.
In the following discussion, it will be advocated that, to obtain results thatare expressive from the developer's as well as the application's point of view, severalevaluation disciplines hould be considered.
275.1 Model-Theoretic Coreference ScoringVilain et al (1996) developed the model-theoretic scoring scheme according to whichprecision and recall values are computed by a formal alignment of the coreferenceequivalence classes of system output and intellectually gathered key data.
Basically,precision errors correspond to nontrivial partitions of system-generated quivalenceclasses induced by key equivalence classes, whereas recall errors correspond to non-trivial partitions of key equivalence classes induced by system-generated equivalenceclasses.Formally, let R s and R k be the coreference relations computed by the anaphorresolution system and specified by the key, respectively; moreover, let \[R s\] and \[Rk\] bethe respective sets of equivalence classes.
Furthermore, with C s ~ \[R s\] and C k E IRk\],let C s n O k and C k N 0 s be the equivalence classes (sets of occurrences) obtained byrestricting the original equivalence classes to the sets of occurrences & and O s overwhich the relations R k and R s, respectively, are defined; a8 analogously, let q~ (C s, R k) and?
(C k, R ~) be the equivalence relations that result by restricting the original relations R kand R S to the occurrences contained in the equivalence classes C ~ E \[R s\] and C k CIRk\], respectively (cf.
the discussion in Section 5.2.1).
29 In addition, let \[~(C k, R~)\] and\[q)(C ~, Rk)\] be the sets of equivalence classes of the restricted relations.
The precisionand recall measures are computed by summing over the sets of equivalence classes ofsystem response and key classes, respectively.
For each class C, there is a maximum ofICN O\] - 1 correct contributions; the actual number of errors, which equals the numberof equivalence classes \]\[q~(C, R)\]\[ of the restricted relation minus 1, has to be deducted.Hence, one obtains the measuresPco :=Rco :=( IC  n okl -c~\[Rq( Ic  n Okl - 1)Csc\[R s\]( Id  n - I\[ (Ck,C k c \[R k\](IC k n Osl - 1)ck ~ \[a k\]5.2 Scoring from the Developer's Point of ViewThe above precision and recall measures refer to a formal, mathematical property ofthe structure of the results computed by coreference resolution systems, namely, thedisjoint partitioning of the set of occurrences in equivalence classes of cospecifying27 See also Mitkov 2001, in which, independently, similar proposals regarding the separate valuation ofanaphor esolution system components have been made.
There are some further importantcontributions of this paper that can be regarded as complementary to the work presented below,particularly the definition of formal evaluation measures for determining the decision power and therelative importance of individual salience factors.28 This means thatR k CO k x O k andR s C 0 s x O s.29 To put it formally: ~(CS,R  k) = R k f3 (C s x C s) and 02(Ck, R s) = R s c3 (C k xCk).494Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution Algorithmentities.
Whereas the definitions are appealing from tile point of view of theoreticalelegance, from the system developer's perspective they display certain shortcomings.5.2.1 Supporting the Optimization of Component Algorithms.
A first point of crit-icism is the lack of expressiveness regarding the different ypical subproblems tobe solved by coreference r solution systems.
One particular subtask that is usuallyhandled by a preprocessor is the identification of relevant occurrences, that is, entity-specifying linguistic expressions.
As a suitable base for evaluating and optimizing thismodule, it seems to be adequate to dedicate separate valuation measures, the defini-tion of which, in this case, is straightforward: letO s and O k be the sets of occurrencescomputed/specified by the coreference r solution system/key, then setrO s n O k\]poc .
-  los}Lo s n oklRoc .
-  iokfTo ensure the expressiveness of the totality of evaluation measures, it is essential thatthey be decoupled from each other in the sense that errors at one stage of processingare exclusively reflected in the respective valuation measure.
Regarding the possibleeffects of precision and recall errors of occurrence identification on model-theoreticcoreference scoring, this requirement is met by referring, in the definitions given inSection 5.1, to the restricted classes C ~ N O k and C k N O S, and to the restricted relations?
(C s, R k) and ~(C k, RS).
Without his refinement of the model-theoretic measures, theremay be cases of scoring anomalies.
If the cardinalities in the above definitions weredetermined by referring to the original (unreduced) equivalence classes and relations,each additional occurrence o s E Cs\O k or o k c Ck\O s would lead to an (incorrect)increase in precision or recall, respectively, because, trivially, these sets of occurrencesare not partitioned by the relations R k or R s, respectively.5.2.2 Supporting the Refinement of Preferential Factors.
As shown in Table 1, theset of relevant salience factors depends on the specific type of anaphoric expression.Hence, the evaluation measures defined so far are considered insufficient for an opti-mization of factor assignments and weights.
From the system developer's perspective,there is a need for fine-grained information that distinguishes between different classesof anaphoric expressions.As will become evident during evaluation of the ROSANA system in Section 6,another reason for differentiating between types of anaphoric expressions i  the lack ofexpressiveness of model-theoretic scoring regarding the interpretation quality achievedfor pronouns (i.e., for the class of anaphors that is, from the perspective of typicalapplications, of central importance).5.3 Scoring from an Application's Point of View: Nonpronominal AnchorsRegarding the requirements of typical applications, g?
the task of pronoun interpreta-tion may be defined as determining a suitable nonpronominal substitute, that is, anonpronominal antecedent rather than an arbitrary cospecifying antecedent that againmight be a pronoun.30 For example, the MUC information extraction task proper (Scenario Template), orthe classicalquantitative, dictionary-based content analysis of the social sciences.495Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4According to model-theoretic coreference scoring, no distinction is made betweenpronominal and nonpronominal antecedents: what is relevant are the sizes of thematching fractions of equivalence classes rather than the presence of correct non-pronominal  anchors suitable as substitute xpressions.
There are at least two reasonswhy the task of identifying correct nonpronominal substitutes i considerably harderthan the task of finding an arbitrary correct antecedent.
First, there is focus-theoreticevidence: typically, entities pecified by pronouns are in fOCUS 31 and, hence, most prob-ably the antecedents of subsequent pronouns, which tend to resume the currentlyfocused entity.
32 Second, a technical argument applies: the cospecification relation be-tween a pronominal anaphor and a nonpronominal representative is algorithmicallydetermined by a nonempty chain of antecedent decisions that may, in general, be long:Gropius ~- he , + he ~ him +,Z_ himWhereas the hypothetical single error (indicated by " - ' )  implies incorrect nonprono-minal anchors for all pronouns, according to the model-theoretic measure the precisionamounts to 0.75.
Consequently, the evaluation scheme defined so far should be sup-plemented by a measure that is expressive with respect o the application-relevant taskof identifying nonpronominal nchors.To derive a suitable formal evaluation measure, one may start with the observationthat the relevant linguistic entities to be resolved are pronominal occurrences P forwhich nonpronominal nchor occurrences A have to be identified.
Basically, an anchorA shall be considered a correct substitute for P if and only if A and P belong to thesame equivalence class of the key coreference relation.
From a theoretical point ofview, this definition must be considered simplistic given the well-known examples ofopaque (intensional) contexts in which the substitution of coreferring expressions i nota truth-preserving operation.
These cases, however, are rare and do not seem to playa role in typical application scenarios of pronoun interpretation algorithms, asHence,the simple definition will be employed, which, in addition, entails the advantage thatthe key data provided for model-theoretic coreference scoring suffices for the scoringof nonpronominal substitutes.Let (P,A) be a pair consisting of a pronominal occurrence P and the anchor oc-currence A determined by the anaphor esolution system.
(If, for P, no substitute hasbeen determined, then A is considered empty.)
A suitable base for scoring is obtainedby classifying the pairs (P, A) according to the scheme described in Table 2, by whicha total of seven pairwise disjoint sets is defined.
The classification depends on (1)whether P and/or  A are tagged, in the key, as valid (entity-specifying) occurrences,(2) whether A is nonempty, and (3) whether, in case A is nonempty and both A andL are valid occurrences, A and L cospecify in the key.
According to the above defini-tion, only the pairs fulfilling condition (3) (which, hence, constitute the set 0++) areconsidered to be correct solutions.31 Care should be taken not to confound two different notions of focus here.
In terms of the classicaltopic-focus distinction, one would say that pronouns tend to specifiy entities constituting the topic.32 Compare, for example, the predictions of the centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995).33 There is another argument that supports the choice of the simple definition.
Probably the bestalgorithmic strategy for determining correct anchors is the selection of the first nonpronominalcospecifying occurrence that topologically precedes the pronoun to be resolved (cf.
the above decisionchain argument).
If,however, the distance between the determined substitute and the pronoun is small,from the point of view of conversational pragmatics it is implausible that the intension of thesubstitute occurrence does not match the (possibly opaque) context, since, otherwise, human readersare expected to be misled as well (Stuckardt 2000, page 240).496Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution AlgorithmTable 2Classification and scoring of nonpronominal nchors.Set Scoring Definitiono++ correct0+_ incorrecto+?

3634 In generalizing the handling of optional coreferences (as originally specified in the coreference taskdefinition \[Hirschman 1998\] with respect to model-theoretic scoring), unresolved pronouns whoseantecedent link is marked as optional in the key (i.e., the elements of the set 0+,) are not taken intoaccount in the recall measure of the nonpronominal nchor discipline.35 The latter simplification is unproblernatic because, under the condition that an expression is a validoccurrence, the decision whether it represents a pronoun is trivial.36 The one-dimensional accuracy measure that is typically employed in the evaluation of pronounresolution algorithms (for example, Lappin and Leass \[1994\] orKennedy and Boguraev \[1996\])implicitly relies on the fact that all pronouns are resolved.
Under this condition, distinguishing betweenprecision and recall becomes unnecessary.
Hence, the definition of the two-dimensional measure(Pna, Rna) must be considered a generalization f the conventional ccuracy measure.
Employing therefined precision/recall distinction even in the case of the arbitrary antecedent discipline may beappropriate when evaluating anaphor resolution systems that aim at achieving high precision byleaving some of the decisions open.497Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 46.

37 The evaluation,which was performed according to the enhanced set of evaluation measures, tookplace under application conditions, that is, without an a priori manual correction oforthographic or syntactic errors.6.1 Entity-Specifying OccurrencesThe upper part of Figure 5 displays the score on the discipline of identifying entity-specifying occurrences (cf.
Section 5.2.1): this subproblem is solved by ROSANA witha (Poc, Roe) performance of (0.94,0.96).
Regarding the precision errors, a closer look re-veals that approximately 50% of the 243 overgenerated occurrences can immediatelybe traced back to errors during morphological and syntactic analysis (in particular,there were a number of cases in which adjectives were wrongly classified as nouns,or in which the parsing of a compound NP failed); another 40% are failures of theROSANA occurrence identification algorithm proper.
Regarding recall, fewer than 20%of the missing 150 occurrences are due to errors of the ROSANA occurrence identifi-cation algorithm.With respect o the identification of pronouns, the performance of (0.94,0.996) isconsiderably higher.
In this important case, precision errors that were caused by mis-categorization of nonreferential occurrences of the expressions it and that are the mainproblem.
An improvement of approximately 50% may be gained by refining the syn-tactic analysis, which, at present, fails in certain cases (e.g.)
to recognize nonreferentialoccurrences of it as formal subjects.6.2 Coreference Classes and Immediate AntecedentsAccording to the model-theoretic coreference scoring scheme defined in Section 5.1,the (P~o,Rco) performance of ROSANA is (0.81,0.68) (Figure 5, coreference classes).A closer analysis of the correctness of the immediate antecedents makes evident hatthe actual interpretation quality varies heavily with respect o the type of anaphoricexpression.
3s Whereas the precision regarding the antecedent choices for namesamounts to 0.94, the performance for the important classes of third person pronounsand possessives i considerably lower (0.71 and 0.76, respectively).
39 Furthermore, asexpected, the precision for reflexive/reciprocal pronouns is optimal (1.0) since bindingprinciple A yields tight syntactic bounds that delimit the space of possible antecedents.Regarding definite NPs, the interpretation quality is considerably lower (0.7) because,at present, ROSANA relies on a simple test for lexical recurrence and number agree-ment and does not employ enhanced techniques for the interpretation of nonpronom-inal anaphora.
4?Finally, the precision for first and second person pronouns is quite37 A scoring module has been implemented by which the above-defined valuation measures arecomputed.
Reference data have been provided by an intellectual nnotation ofthe press release corpusaccording to the MUC-7 coreference task definition (Hirschman 1998).38 Regarding the anaphor type abbreviations employed in Figure 5, see Section 4.5.39 The figures regarding the correctness of immediate arbitrary antecedents have been determinedaccording to the precision measure that was originally developed for scoring nonpronominal anchors.Since, at least for the most common types of third person pronouns (PER3, POS3), immediateantecedents are determined invirtually any case, the recall figures are almost identical (cf.
thediscussion i  Section 5.3).
The precision measure coincides with the accuracy measure mployed by, forexample, Lappin and Leass (1994) or Kennedy and Boguraev (1996).40 The results in Figure 5 also indicate that a huge fraction of definite NP occurrences (1,973 + 43) are notassigned an antecedent.
This figure, which at first sight seems to be too high, is of the right order of498Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution AlgorithmOCCURRENCES:- SYS :  243- KEY:  150- SYS AND KEY:  3831=> PRECIS ION:  0 .9404=> RECALL :  0 .9623COREFERENCE CLASSES:SYSTEM CLASSES- CUTS:  256- POSS IBLE:  1334=> PRECIS ION:  0 .8081KEY  CLASSES- CUTS:  496- POSS IBLE:  1572=> RECALL :  0 .6845IMMEDIATE ANTECEDENTS:I PRECIS  I ++ I +- I +?.

Regarding pronouns, a closer analysis hows thatapproximately 30% of precision errors are due to the assignment of incorrect genderattributes during morphological analysis and occurrence identification, and, hence,may be eliminated if additional lexical information becomes available.
Another 30%of errors are induced by cases that are beyond the horizon of the heuristic salience-based antecedent ranking in the sense that a theoretically adequate solution wouldrely on background knowledge that usually is unavailable in unrestricted applicationcontexts.On one hand, the discussion reveals that refinements should focus on third personpronouns and definite NPs.
On the other hand, the results also indicate that, on thebasis of the information usually available in knowledge-poor environments, there islittle room for further improvement.
416.3 Nonpronominal AnchorsRegarding the task of identifying nonpronominal nchors, the results fall considerablybelow the figures determined above for the immediate (arbitrary) antecedent case.According to the (Pna, R~a) measures defined in Section 5.3, the average precision isreduced to 0.70 (compared with 0.76); regarding third person pronouns and posses-sives, the precision decreases to 0.68 (0.71) and 0.66 (0.76), respectively.The striking difference with the results of model-theoretic and immediate (arbi-trary) antecedent scoring confirms the arguments put forward in Section 5.3 accordingto which the determination ofnonpronominal nchors is considerably harder: whereas,for 306 pronouns, correct immediate (arbitrary) antecedents as well as nonpronomi-nal anchors were determined, there are another 21 cases in which only the formerchoice proved to be correct (cf.
the chain argument).
Furthermore, the focus-theoreticargument is supported: out of the selected antecedents of type pronoun, 85.6% werecorrect, whereas, out of the selected antecedents of type definite NP/name, only 71.3%were correct.
Hence, as a proper base for obtaining results that are expressive with re-spect o the pronoun substitution task, the model-theoretic coreference scoring schemeshould be supplemented with the described additional measures.6.4 Toward a Genre-Specific Assignment of Preference FactorsSince the assignment of the salience factors and their weights has been heuristicallyoptimized on a training corpus of news agency press releases (cf.
Section 4.5), thequestion arises whether, on one hand, these settings are still optimal on the evaluationset of press releases, and, on the other hand, they are optimal on other corpora drawnfrom different genres and domains as well.
Five experiments were conducted to ad-dress these topics.
The second evaluation corpus consisted of three texts describing theplots of Mozart operas.
These texts, which comprise 2,522 words and 236 pronouns,were considered suitable since they differ considerably from the press releases in textgenre, domain, and formal characteristics (e.g., the higher density of pronouns).The five experiments that were conducted are: (1) deactivated syntactic paral-lelism, (2) deactivated syntactic subject salience A deactivated syntactic role hierarchymagnitude since, in the key of the press release corpus, around 2,300 coreference lasses are specified,the first textual mention of which is typically accomplished by a common oun or name.41 Regarding the coreference lass task, one must keep in mind that even the interannotator agreementthat was measured uring key construction i MUC-6 amounts only to 81%.
Clearly, humanperformance with respect to the annotation of reference corpora, which, to a large extent, depends onthe complexity of the task definition, imposes an upper bound on the system performance that is, inprinciple, measurable.500Stuckardt  A Robust  Anaphor  Reso lu t ion  A lgor i thmTable 3Var iat ion of  p re ference  s t ra teg ies  of  ROSANA.News agency press releases corpusExperiment Pco Rco Pna Rna PER3 POS3ROSANA (orig.)

Section 4.5).
The results are shown in Table 3, where rows correspond to the differ-ent experiments and co lumns  42 represent the most important evaluation measures.
43First, the table reveals that, with respect o the system's performance in interpret-ing pronominal naphora, the model-theoretic s oring scheme must be regarded as anunsuitable indicator since the sensitivity with respect to the salience strategy variationsis too low.
Second, the results on the evaluation set of the press release corpus confirmthe original assignment of salience factors and weights.
Moreover, some interestingobservations concerning the relative contributions of the factors can be made.
Thealgorithmically trivial preference criterion of sentence recency proved to be the mostvaluable factor (Experiment (4)).
44 In the case of the press release corpus and regardingthe PER3 measure, a relation of mutual substitution seems to hold between the factorsof syntactic parallelism and subject salience/syntactic role hierarchy: whereas deacti-vation of either strategy results in a moderate performance r duction (Experiments (1)and (2), respectively), deactivation of both strategies induces considerable deterioration(Experiment (3)).
These findings are in line with the results of Lappin and Leass (1994),who made similar observations in their factor variation experiments, but conjecturedon a more abstract level that a relationship of complex interdependency holds betweenthe different syntactic salience factors.
4s In providing evidence for a relation of mutual42 In the columns labeled PER3 and POS3, the results in the immediate (arbitrary) antecedent disciplineare shown.43 The results of the original version of ROSANA on the Mozart operas corpus are: (Poe, Roe) = (0.95,0.98),(Peo, Rco) = (0.88,0.81), (Pna, Rna) = (0.75,0.74); nonpronominal  nchors for pronouns of typePER3/POS3 are determined with a precision of 0.70/0,76.
Hence, performance is even better than onthe press release corpus, a result that may be partly explained by the higher proportion of pronounsand names,  which, as observed above, are resolvable with higher precision than definite NPs.44 This result coincides with similar f indings by numerous  other researchers, for example, Lappin andLeass (1994, page 551).45 Lappin and Leass took into account four groups of "structural" salience factors: parallelism,501Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4substitution between two important classes of syntactic preference factors, the aboveresults allow for a more precise rendering of this statement.Closer investigation of the results on the Mozart operas corpus reveals that thefactor assignment only partly generalizes.
The result deterioration i duced by deac-tivation of sentence recency (Experiment (4)) is even larger, a finding that may beexplained by a characteristic property of the cohesion structure of opera plot texts,namely, the rapid shifts of the local foci from scene to scene, which contrasts harplywith the typically steady focus in the press release texts.
If the sentence recency factor isswitched off, this implies that the remaining focus-approximating salience factors (syn-tactic parallelism, subject salience, hierarchy of syntactic function) may lead to wrongdecisions ince the local foci of past scenes, which in the meantime have moved outof focus, would receive the same salience.A similar observation of cohesion structure dependency may be made regardingsyntactic parallelism in the POS3 strategy.
Whereas, with respect o the press releasecorpus, the positive contribution of this factor is confirmed, for the Mozart operatexts, a negative contribution was measured: the deactivation i Experiment (1) yieldsa gain of 3%.
Closer analysis of the documents reveals that local contexts contributingmultiple POS3 occurrences with different reference are typical for this text genre:(9) On a dark night in Seville, Leporello is keeping watch, grumbling,outside a house in which his master Don Giovanni is engaged in hislatest amorous pursuit.Again, the findings of the factor assignment experiments permit elaboration on aconjecture by Lappin and Leass (1994, page 552), according to which considerableimprovement should be achieved by employing, for an optimization of the factorassignments, tatistical analyses of patterns of pronominal anaphora in corpora.
Moreprecisely, the above results indicate that the text genre is reflected in some formalproperties of the cohesion structure that are important clues for the choice of factors.In other words, the experiments indicate that salience factors and weights should beassigned in a genre-specific way.
46 F rom a practical point of view, these results arehighly relevant since, meanwhile, various referentially annotated corpora of differentgenres (particularly the key data provided in formal evaluations) have been madeavailable.7.
Comparison and ConclusionIn the previous ections, a robust approach to anaphor interpretation has been devel-oped that follows the deficient description model.
Based on a set of disjoint referencerule patterns for fragmentary syntax, the ROSANA system accomplishes coreferenceresolution with high precision and recall in various evaluation disciplines.
The eval-uation was carried out according to an enhanced set of scoring measures that shedslight on aspects of development as well as application.
The different arguments putforward for an enhancement of the evaluation methodology for coreference r solutionsystems have been confirmed.
In particular, the evaluation results have proven thenonadverbial/matrix and head emphasis, hierarchy of syntactic roles, and cataphora penalty.
Whereas,during individual deactivation of these factors, they observed comparatively small deteriorations ofless than 4%, the combined eactivation led to a reduction of more than 25% (Lappin and Leass 1994,page 552).46 In searching for additional evidence, further tests on corpora of other text genres hould be carried out.502Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution Algorithmlack of sensitivity of the original model-theoretic coreference scoring scheme with re-spect o salience strategy variation as well as pronoun interpretation quality.
Moreover,the figures confirm that, regarding pronouns, determining nonpronominal nchors ismore difficult than computing arbitrary cospecifying antecedents: on average, resultsin the former discipline are 5.5% (press releases)/5% (Mozart operas corpus) belowthe results in the latter discipline.As a proper basis for comparing ROSANA with the approaches of Lappin andLeass (1994) and Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), one must focus on the evaluation re-sults for third person pronouns in the immediate (arbitrary) antecedent discipline (asdiscussed in Section 6.2).
For third person pronouns (comprising nonpossessives, pos-sessives, reflexives/reciprocals, and relative pronouns), ROSANA determined cospeci-185 fying antecedents with a precision of 4~922 = 0.75 (press releases) and 2~ = 0.79 (Mozartoperas corpus).
At first sight, the gap between these figures and the precision of 0.86that was determined for the (nonrobust) approach of Lappin and Leass is still con-siderable, a difference that may be partly attributed to the more difficult conditionsof robust processing, and partly to the (presumably well-behaved) characteristics ofthe text corpus employed by Lappin and Leass (computer manuals).
The standard ofcomparison, however, is the robust approach of Kennedy and Boguraev, which followsthe shallow description model and which achieves an average precision of 0.75 on abroad set of texts taken from different genres and domains.
In the case of ROSANA, aprecision of 0.75 is achieved on the corpus of press releases, which exhibits the typicalproperties of mass texts (e.g., a comparatively high rate of orthographic and syntac-tic errors) and, hence, presumably imposes high demands on robust processing.
Onthe Mozart operas corpus, which, in this sense, is easier, the scores are considerablyhigher.
However, since different evaluation corpora have been used, and, moreover,since the precision figure mentioned in the results of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) isnot qualified with respect o text genre, a direct comparison of the empirical resultsshould be based on further investigations.
47As an alternative way of comparing the two approaches, their performance withrespect o the robust algorithmization of anaphor esolution strategies that rely on syn-tactic evidence (in particular, syntactic disjoint reference) may be evaluated in detail.Regarding the scope of robust processing of ROSANA according to the deficient de-scription model, a qualification of the typical failures gives evidence that, with respectto the fragmentary descriptions generated by the chosen parser, the robust imple-mentation of syntactic disjoint reference is nearly optimal.
None of the 7 incorrectantecedent choices that are due to failures of the disjoint reference strategy (out of atotal of 246 wrong antecedent choices for the evaluation corpus of press releases) aredue to wrong predictions of the (still partly heuristic) algorithmization of the binding-theoretic restrictions; rather, they are caused by wrong (in contrast o fragmentary,i.e., partial) parsing results: while already employing defensive parsing strategies, theparser still overgenerates in certain cases.
In 6 of the 7 disjoint reference failures, a con-figurationally admissible candidate has been erroneously eliminated; in the remainingcase, a configurationally forbidden candidate has been erroneously approved.
Hence,there is a tendency toward overgenerating disjoint reference restrictions.
A detailed47 This might be achieved either by employing the corpus used by Kennedy and Boguraev, which wasnot available at the time ROSANA was evaluated, or by running Kennedy and Boguraev's algorithm (areimplementation f which requires, in particular, a formal description of the regular filter employedby Kennedy and Boguraev to partially infer constituency) on the news agency press releases andMozart operas corpora.503Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4analysis reveals that, in 4 of the 6 cases, the respective parsing error consists in awrong interpretation of a structurally ambiguous relative clause.
This gives evidencethat, while the rate of disjoint reference failure is already very low (2.8% of all failures),a slight improvement may be achieved by employing a more defensive parsing strat-egy with a slightly higher level of syntactic fragmentation, which, by now, amountsto an average of 2.61 fragments per sentence.
48These findings may be compared with the results of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996),which report 2 cases of pronoun misinterpretation (out of a total of 75 failures) thatare due to a failure to establish configurationally determined isjoint reference, andseveral additional cases in which a wrong antecedent was chosen because of a wrongheuristic assignment of syntactic salience factors.
Hence, with respect o syntactic dis-joint reference, the failure rate of the shallow description approach (2.7% of all failures)of Kennedy and Boguraev is of the same order of magnitude as that of the deficient de-scription approach followed by ROSANA (2.8%).
As the above analysis has revealed,however, in the case of ROSANA, the disjoint reference rrors are not induced byfailures of the heuristic algorithmization of the disjoint reference conditions; instead,they can be traced back to wrong decisions made during parsing, thus leaving someroom for improvement by fine-tuning the rule pattern set and parsing strategy.
Thisopens up the possibility of a further refinement, which is the immediate consequenceof the conceptually transparent way of implementing robust disjoint reference by fol-lowing the deficient description model.
Regarding the syntactic preference strategies,ROSANA scores well, too: only 3 wrong antecedent decisions (1.2% of all failures) aredue to errors in the assignment of syntactic salience factors.Since the difference in interpretation quality can be expected to be small, the de-cision whether to follow the shallow description approach or the deficient descriptionapproach may be based on practical considerations.
Whereas the former approachimposes lesser demands on preprocessing resources and implementation, the latterapproach may yield slightly better results.
If one considers implementation and fine-tuning of the deficient description algorithm relative to a particular parser as a once-and-for-all effort, and, moreover, takes into account the further benefits of havingpartial syntactic analyses available during anaphor esolution, 49the deficient descrip-tion approach may be the method of choice for robust anaphor esolution.
Dependingon the parser that is used and the characteristics of the texts to be interpreted, which,in large part, determine number and type of failures of robust syntactic disjoint ref-erence, it may, in certain cases, be reasonable to apply a hybrid strategy that aims atavoiding, as far as possible, heuristic decisions: if the syntactic analysis yields suf-ficient evidence, deficient descriptions are employed; otherwise, shallow descriptionrules are used.
s?48 As emphasized in Section 3.3, since, in general, the choice of rule patterns for robust disjoint referenceshould depend on the parser that is used, an increase in the degree of parse fragmentation may giverise to extending the set of patterns.
The general question of optimizing the choice of rule patterns,relative to a given parser, is an important issue that deserves further attention.49 For example, Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) mention the problem of interpreting quoted speechseparately from its surrounding context, acomplex problem whose solution should be facilitated ifricher syntactic nformation isavailable.
In fact, ROSANA already employs everal successful heuristicsfor interpreting anaphors in quoted speech, such as the handling of first person pronouns that occur inthe subject position of a quoted sentence.50 Since the number of disjoint reference failures is already low, the potential benefits of employing ahybrid strategy are limited.
Whether there may be an additional contribution depends heavily on thedegree to which the two strategies ofrobust syntactic disjoint reference differ with respect to theirfailure cases, which should thus be analyzed by an in-depth evaluation on large corpora.504Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution AlgorithmWhereas the robust algorithmization of syntactic disjoint reference has thus beenachieved in a nearly optimal way, with respect o the overall set of anaphor esolutionstrategies, there is considerably more room for improvement.
Regarding the impor-tant case of pronoun interpretation, asdetermined in Section 6.2, more than 30% of thefailures are due to the assignment of incorrect gender attributes, and another 30% areinduced by cases that are beyond the horizon of the heuristic antecedent preferencestrategies.
Under the conditions of robust, operational processing, whereas the formerproblem may be solved by a once-and-for-all improvement of the lexical resources, thelatter case remains difficult since, in general, background knowledge will be needed.According to the results of the formal evaluation, at least a partial, genre-specific re-f inement of the preference strategies may be achieved in a manner compatible with theconditions of robust processing.
While a more systematic investigation and evaluationof the latter issue is pending, the above results give rise to the expectation that, byexploiting the potential for further improvements, robust approaches to anaphor eso-lution should be able to achieve a precision of 0.8 (arbitrary antecedent discipline) and0.75 (nonpronominal nchor discipline) even on difficult text genres like press releases.AcknowledgmentsThe author is grateful to Pasi Tapanainen,who provided the parses for the texts of theevaluation corpora.
