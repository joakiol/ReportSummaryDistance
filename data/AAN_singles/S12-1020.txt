First Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM), pages 124?131,Montre?al, Canada, June 7-8, 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsSimple and Phrasal ImplicativesLauri KarttunenStanford UniversityCSLI, 210 Panama St.Stanford, CA 94305, USAlaurik@stanford.eduAbstractThis paper complements a series of works onimplicative verbs such as manage to and failto.
It extends the description of simple im-plicative verbs to phrasal implicatives as takethe time to and waste the chance to.
It showsthat the implicative signatures of over 300verb-noun collocations depend both on the se-mantic type of the verb and the semantic typeof the noun in a systematic way.1 IntroductionThere is a substantial body of literature on the se-mantics of English complement constructions start-ing with (Kiparsky and Kiparsky, 1970) and (Kart-tunen, 1971; Karttunen, 1973), including (Rudanko,1989; Rudanko, 2002; Nairn et al, 2006; Egan,2008).
These studies have developed a semanticclassification of verbs and verb-noun collocationsthat take sentential complements.
They focus onconstructions that give rise to implied commitmentsthat the author cannot disavow without being inco-herent or without contradicting herself.
For exam-ple, (1a) presupposes that Kim had not rescheduledthe meeting, (1b) entails that she didn?t and presup-poses that she intended to reschedule it.
(1) a. Kim forgot that she had not rescheduled themeeting.b.
Kim forgot to reschedule the meeting.FACTIVE constructions like forget that X involvepresuppositions, IMPLICATIVE constructions likeforget to X give rise to entailments and may carrypresuppositions.Presuppositions persist under negation, in ques-tions and if-clauses, entailments do not.
For ex-ample, the negation of (1b), Kim did not forgetto reschedule the meeting, entails that Kim didreschedule the meeting and presupposes, as (1b)does, that it was her intention to do so.Implicative constructions involve entailments.The entailment may be positive or negative depend-ing on the polarity of the containing clauses.
Replac-ing forget by didn?t forget in (1b) gives an entailmentof the opposite polarity.
Questions and if-clauses donot yield any entailments.2 Simple implicativesThe constructions forget to X and remember to X aretwo-way implicative constructions.
They yield anentailment about the truth or falsity of X both in af-firmative and in negative sentences.
We use the no-tation + ?
| ?
+ for the verb forget to to indicate thatforget to X yields a negative entailment for X in a posi-tive context, +?, and a positive entailment in a negativecontext, ?+.
The first sign stands for the polarity of theembedding context, the second sign for the polarity of theentailment.
We code the verb remember to as ++ | ?
?because in a positive context remember to X yields a pos-itive entailment about X, ++, and the opposite, ?
?, in anegative context.There are two major types of implicative construc-tions.
TWO-WAY IMPLICATIVES like forget to and re-member to yield an entailment both in positive and neg-ative contexts, ONE-WAY IMPLICATIVES yield an entail-ment only under one polarity.
Karttunen (1971; 1973)and Nairn et al (2006) list verbs of both types.
Table 1gives a few examples of two-way implicatives.124++ | ?

forget thatX is factive but forget to X is a +?|?+ implicative con-struction.
(1a) presupposes that Kim had not rescheduledthe meeting, (1b) entails that she didn?t.1 If we replaceforgot in (1) by didn?t forget, the presupposition of (1a)remains intact but the entailment of (1b) reverses polar-ity: Kim did reschedule the meeting.2 In contrast to for-get, pretend that X and pretend to X are both counterfac-tive.
The sentences in (2) and their affirmative counter-parts presuppose that Kim did not have everything figuredout.
(2) a. Kim didn?t pretend that she had everything fig-ured out.b.
Kim didn?t pretend to have everything figuredout.The polarity of a clause is determined from top down.
(3) entails that Kim ate breakfast because the two neg-ative polarities of almost and fail cancel out and fail toX and remember to X are both two-way implicative con-structions.
(3) Kim almost failed to remember to eat breakfast.The chain of inferences is sketched in (4) where [+]marks the top-level expression as true.
The subsequent[+] and [?]
signs indicate the entailed polarity of eachsubordinate clause.
(4) [+] almost(fail-to(remember-to(X)))[?]
fail-to(remember-to(X))1All the two-way implicatives in Table 1 also give rise toa presupposition.
(1b) and its negative counterpart presupposethat Kim had intended to reschedule the meeting.2It is possible to interpret the example differently by focus-ing the negation on the word forget: Kim did not FORGET toreschedule the meeting.
She never intended to do that.
See(Karttunen and Peters, 1979), (Horn, 1985) for further discus-sion of this type of ?metalinguistic negation?
that objects to theuse of a particular word or locution but not necessarily to whatthe sentence entails.
[+] remember-to(X)[+] XIn short, almost(X) and fail-to(X) switch the polarity ofthe entailment, remember-to(X) preserves it.
Omitting al-most (or fail to) from (3) reverses the entailed polarity ofthe eat-clause.
(5) Kim failed to remember to eat breakfast.
(6) [+] fail-to(remember-to(X))[?]
remember-to(X)[?]
X2.2 One-way implicativesConstructions such as manage to X and fail to X are per-fectly symmetrical in that they yield an entailment bothin affirmative and negative contexts.
As noted early on,(Karttunen, 1971; Karttunen, 1973), there are four typesof verbs that yield an entailment about their complementclause only under one or the other polarity.++ implicatives +?
implicativescause NP to refuse toforce NP to prevent NP frommake NP to keep NP from??
implicatives ?+ implicativescan (= be able to) hesitate toTable 2: Types of one-way implicative verbsThe ++ and some of the +?
implicatives in Table 2are causatives.3 (7a) entails that Mary left, (7b) entailsthat she didn?t.
(7c) and (7d) are consistent with Maryleaving or not leaving.
(7) a. Kim forced Mary to leave.
(*but she didn?t)b. Kim prevented Mary from leaving.c.
Kim did not force Mary to leave.d.
Kim did not prevent Mary from leaving.The +?
implicatives switch the polarity of the en-tailment from positive to negative.
(8) does not tell uswhether Dave left or not because force to does not yieldany entailment under negative polarity about its comple-ment.3Rudanko (2002) points out that there is a causative con-struction that is not associated with any particular verb: Shebullied him into marrying her entails that he married her.
It ap-pears that all constructions of the type TV NP into X are ++implicatives.125(8) Kim prevented Mary from forcing Dave to leave.
(9) [+] prevent-to(X, force-to(Y, Z))[?]
force-to(Y, Z)[ ] ZThe??
implicatives express a necessary condition forthe truth of the complement clause.
If the host clause isunder negative polarity, the complement clause is false.
(10) entails that Kim did not finish her sentence.
(10) Kim could not finish her sentence.It appears that hesitate to is the only ?+ implicativeverb in English.
(11) entails that Kim spoke her mind.
(11) Kim did not hesitate to speak her mind.Omitting the negation in (11) makes it non-committal asto whether Kim spoke her mind or not.4 There are otherverbs such as shy away from and shrink from that yield apositive entailment under negation but they are two-wayimplicatives like avoid to.
The verb wait to has one in-terpretation that has the same implicative signature as nothesitate to but the construction not wait to is ambiguous.2.3 Ambiguity of not wait to XThe construction not wait to X can be understood in twoways.
The example in (12a) could be continued eitherwith (12b) or (12c).
(12) a. Ed did not wait to call for help.b.
.
.
.
Instead he left the scene in a hurry.c.
.
.
.
But it was too late.The continuation (12b) implies that Ed did not call forhelp, (12c) implies that Ed called for help right away.
Theword instead in (12b) and the anaphoric it in (12c) areclues that indicate whether Ed made a call or not.A Google search finds numerous examples of bothtypes.
The sentences in (13) contain wait to X in the ?
?sense, in the the examples in (14) it has the ?+ interpre-tation.
(13) a. Deena did not wait to talk to anyone.
Instead,she ran home.b.
He did not wait to hear Ms. Coulter?s response,but immediately walked up the balcony stairsand left.4Although not hesitate to X seems to deny that there wasany hesitation to X, many examples from the web suggest oth-erwise: When I got the paper back I almost hesitated to see thegrade, but when I saw the A on the title page, that hesitationquickly turned into relief.
Not hesitate to X is an idiom, it is notcompositional.c.
He was so excited to get his Thomas set that hedidn?t wait to take off his coat.
(14) a.
It hurt like hell, but I?m glad she didn?t wait totell me.b.
Kalamazoo didn?t wait to strike back.
The K-Wings scored two goals in less than 90 seconds.c.
I didn?t wait to open the gift.
Heck, I didn?teven wait to wear them.
They?re the softest mostcomfy overalls I?ve ever owned.The construction not wait to X is not vague about thetruth or falsity of the complement.
Either it means thatX was not done at all or it means that X was done rightaway without delay.
In most contexts it is immediatelyclear which interpretation the author has in mind.
Theambiguity mostly goes unnoticed.The source of the ambiguity can be seen in exampleswhere wait to has two infinitival complements.
(15) a.
?My biggest regret is that I didn?t wait [to getmarried] [to have kids]?
says Gerald, a father ofthree.
?If I had it to do over again, I?d wait untilI was married to become a father.?b.
Chances are, you probably didn?t wait [to getpermission from the scientific establishment] [tostart believing in the creative power of thoughtand the underlying spirituality of the universe].c.
I raised my hand above my head, as if I were inschool or something, but didn?t wait [for anyoneto give me the ?okay?]
[to start talking].The examples in (15) have the form not wait [to X] [toY].
They entail that X did not happen but Y is true.
Inother words wait to is??
with respect to its first comple-ment and ?+ with respect to the second.
In (15a) Geralddid not get married but had kids.
In (15b) the addresseeprobably started believing without the permission of thescientific establishment.The implicit assumption in these cases is that onemight see X as a precondition for Y but the protagonistskipped X and proceeded directly to Y.
The ambiguityarises from the fact that syntactically the two comple-ments of wait to are both optional.In the case of (15a), Gerald might have said My great-est regret is that I didn?t wait to get married leaving outthe second complement, or he might have said My great-est regret is that I didn?t wait to have kids leaving out thefirst.
(13c) came with a picture of a boy with his blue coatstill on playing with his new Thomas train set.
(14c) camewith a picture of a girl wearing her comfy birthday giftoveralls in advance of her birthday.126In the case of (12a) that is ambiguous without a con-text, the reader has to guess whether it should be readas Ed did not wait [to call for help][.
.
. ]
or Ed did notwait [.
.
. ]
[to call for help].
The continuation (12b) isconsistent with the first option, (12c) with the second.The fact that the ambiguity of (12a) is syntactic ratherthan semantic explains why it is not possible to translatethis sentence to languages such as Finnish, German andFrench in a way that preserves the ambiguity.
The trans-lator has to decide which of the two interpretations is theright one because they translate differently.
In this re-spect (12a) is similar to well known examples such astime flies like an arrow and I saw her duck that have noambiguity-preserving translations in other languages be-cause the ambiguity comes from accidental lexical andsyntactic overlaps that are language-specific.2.4 Invited inferencesAlthough one-way implicatives yield a definite entail-ment only under one polarity, in many contexts they areinterpreted as if they were two-way implicatives.
For ex-ample, the complement of prevent from in negative sen-tences such as (16) is likely to be understood to be trueand the author probably intended the sentence to be inter-preted in that way.
(16) The language barrier did not prevent us from havinga few laughs together.If something was not prevented or if someone could do it,it may have happened.
If someone was not forced to dosomething or hesitated doing it, maybe she did not do it.However, an explicit denial is possible as in (17) showingthat the inference about the veridicality of the comple-ment is pragmatically based, not truth-conditional.
(17) a.
Her mother did not prevent her from visiting herfather, but she never did.b.
He showed he could jab, but didn?t.
He showedhe could work the body, but didn?t.c.
The school had not forced the students to leave,but they left on their own.d.
She hesitated to ask, but had to: ?Stateside?
?The promotion of can and be able to from a one-wayimplicative to a two-way implicative is similar to the phe-nomenon that (Geis and Zwicky, 1971) discuss under thelabel of INVITED INFERENCE.
What they observe is thetendency to read conditionals as biconditionals.
For ex-ample, If you mow my lawn I will give you $5 is usuallyinterpreted as I will give you $5 if and only if you mow mylawn.
Invited inferences may be explicitly cancelled.
asin (17), and they do not even arise in contexts where theywould conflict with what is known: Firms were allowedto earn more than they did earn.
Obviously, firms did notearn more than they earned.
No invited inference in thiscase.The phenomenon of invited inferences is much moreprevalent than has been recognized and it has not beensystematically studied except for SCALAR IMPLICA-TURES for which there is a vast literature.53 Phrasal implicativesThere is a large class of multiword constructions that aresemantically similar to the single verbs in Tables 1 and 2.We call them PHRASAL IMPLICATIVES.
They are com-posed of a transitive verb such as have, make, take anduse, and a noun phrase headed by a noun such as attempt,effort and opportunity that can take sentential comple-ments.
The ?implicative signature?
of such a phrase de-pends both on the type of verb and the type of the noun.We organize the presentation by the nouns.3.1 attempt, effort, trouble, initiativeIn the case of attempt the relation between a single verbimplicative and a phrasal one is obvious.
For example,attempt to X and make an attempt to X are virtually syn-onymous.6(18) a. Kim didn?t attempt to hide her feelings.b.
Kim didn?t make any attempt to hide her feel-ings.c.
Kim made no effort to hide her feelings.All the examples in (18) entail that Kim did not hide herfeelings.
The affirmative versions of these sentences arenon-committal with respect to the complement clause.Attempts and efforts can fail.
Consequently, attempt to X,make an attempt to X and make an effort to X are all ?
?implicatives like allow NP to X in Table 2.
The phrasalversion provides more ways to express negation than thesimple verb.
It can be expressed by the determiner as in(18c).Another way to bring about a negative entailment inthis construction is to indicate by an adjective such asfutile that an attempt was made but it failed.
(19) Convair made a futile attempt to save their bomberprogram.5http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_implicature6We assume here that the infinitival clause is syntacticallya complement to the noun.
In (18b), (18c) and in all the laterexamples in this section there is an alternative syntactic anal-ysis under which the to-complement expresses a purpose.
Inthat sense it does not modify the noun but the verb.
The pur-pose clause could be fronted separately, as in To hide her feel-ings, Kim turned away.
Purpose clauses are non-committal asto whether the intended purpose was achieved.127Conversely, make a successful attempt to X entails thatX came about.
Attempts can be described as bungled,defeated, foiled, etc.
that all yield a negative entailmentfor the complement.Complement taking nouns tend to occur with specificverbs.
Attempt can appear with have, make and take butmake is by far the most common collocate verb for thisnoun.
Semantically have/make/take an attempt to X areall ??
implicatives.The choice of the collocate verb makes a differencefor many other nouns.
In particular, make an effort to Xis a ??
implicative but take an effort to X is a two-wayimplicative.
It has the signature + + | ?
?
as illustratedin (20).
(20) a.
He took an effort to bring me to the butterflygarden.b.
She took no effort to dress in style.In these examples take an effort to X is an equi-construction.
They are in contrast with the take an effortsentences in (21).
(21) a.
Before people had computers, it took an effortto infringe copyright.b.
It took no effort to unscrew the bolt.c.
Did it take an effort to be so clever?The examples in (21) do not contain phrasal implicatives,they have an extraposed complement clause.
Extraposi-tion is a factive construction.
The extraposed infinitivalclauses in (21) are presupposed.The nouns trouble and initiative are like effort in thatthey form a ++ | ?
?
implicative phrase with take.
(22) a.
She took the trouble to iron all the clothes.b.
Napoleon didn?t take the trouble to study thecountry he was going to invade.3.2 opportunity, chance, occasionThe phrase take the/an opportunity to X is a two-way ++|??
implicative whereas have the/an opportunity to X isonly a ??
implicative.
(23a) entails that Kim expressedher feelings, (23b) entails the opposite.
(23) a. Kim took the opportunity to express her feel-ings.b.
Kim didn?t take the opportunity to express herfeelings.Replacing took by have as in (24) takes away the pos-itive entailment.
(24a) is non-commital with respect tothe veridicality of the complement, (24b) has the samenegative entailment as (23b).
(24) a. Kim had the opportunity to express her feelings.b.
Kim didn?t have the opportunity to express herfeelings.In (24) one could substitute get for have as getting some-thing entails having it and not getting something entailsnot having it.
The substitution of lack or miss or lose forhave in (24) turns the??
implicative into a +?
implica-tive.
In (25) we get a negative entailment in the affirma-tive and no entailment under negation.
(25) a.
The Belarusians lacked the opportunity to createa distinctive national identity.b.
I didn?t lack the opportunity to engage in a rela-tionship, I just felt no desire to.There are several verbs that can substitute for take in (23)without changing the entailments.
They include more de-scriptive synonyms for take such as seize, grab and snap.There is also another family of verbs, use, utilize, exploitand expend, that yield a two-way + + | ?
?
implicativephrase with the/an opportunity to X.
(26) a. Randy used the opportunity to toot his ownhorn.b.
Randy didn?t use the opportunity to toot his ownhorn.Here use could be replaced by make use of, itself a + +| ?
?
implicative phrase.Another class of verbs that yield implicative construc-tions with the/a opportunity to X consists of lose, miss,squander and waste that entail either not having or notusing an opportunity.
(27) a. Mr. Spitzer wasted the opportunity to drive aharder bargain.b.
Galileo did not waste the opportunity to aim afunny mock-syllogism at Grassi?s flying eggs.Although WordNet classifies the verb waste as a hyponymof the verb use, the two constructions, use the opportu-nity to X and waste the opportunity to X, have oppositeentailment signatures.
(27a) entails that Spitzer did notdrive a harder bargain.
Replacing waste by did not usein (27a) yields the same entailment as the original: hedidn?t.
Similarly, (27b) entails that Galileo aimed a mocksyllogism at this opponent but replacing waste by use in(27b) entails that he did not do that.
In other words, usethe/an opportunity to X is a + + | ?
?
implicative, butwaste the/an opportunity to X is a +?
| ?+ implicativeconstruction.Table 3 below summarizes the observations in this sec-tion.
HAVE stands for have and get; LACK for lack, miss,give up, throw away and discard; TAKE for take, seize,grab and snap; USE for use, utilize, exploit and expend;128WASTE for waste, squander and drop; OPPORTUNITY foropportunity, chance and occasion.

(28) a. I wasted the money to buy a game that I cannotplay.b.
I wasted $10 to buy it.c.
I am thrilled I didn?t waste $10 to see it in thetheater.d.
I?m so glad I didn?t waste money to have some-one else do it.
(28a) and (28b) entail that I bought the game, (28c) and(28d) yield a negative entailment.Constructions waste NP to X where NP is headed by anoun that describes something of value like asset, money,time.

(29) a. I wasted the time to read through the wholething.b.
He didn?t waste time to stop and look for signsof her trail.c.
I read that it did not work, so didn?t waste perksto get it.d.
I?m glad I didn?t waste 90 minutes to see thisfilm.e.
I wasted an hour to play this game.But waste time to X is a special case.
It has an alterna-tive idiomatic reading in negative sentences as illustratedin (30).
(30) a. Dunning didn?t waste any time to begin writinghis second film.b.
Madonna didn?t waste time to move on to hernext single.c.
Secularists wasted no time to jump in flawedstudy?s bandwagon.Wasting no time to X in the sense of ?quickly do X?
is anidiomatic use of waste.
The examples in (30) do not meanthe opposite if the negation is removed.
To express theidea opposite to (30b), for example, you have to resort toanother idiom, Madonna took her time to move on to hernext single, it is not correct to say that she wasted time.Without the possessive, take the time to X is a straight-forward ++ |??
implicative construction, have the timeto X is ?
?.3.4 ability, power, means, oomphHaving the ability to do something is a precondition fordoing it.
Lacking or losing the ability to X precludes do-ing X.
Both examples in (31) yield a negative entailmentfor the complement clause.
(31) a.
The defendant had no ability to pay a fine.b.
The crickets were there, but they had lost theability to sing.The affirmative cases are less clear.
(32a) does not entailthat Google has been tracking you, but an affirmative an-swer to the on-line survey in (32b) would interpreted bythe author of the survey to mean that the Helpdesk actu-ally solved your issues.
(32) a. Google has had the ability to track your onlinebehavior.b.
The Helpdesk had the ability to solve your is-sues.
Yes or No?We classify have the ability to X as a ??
implicative andlose the ability to X as a +?
implicative.
But perhapsability and power should also be included in the next classof nouns to accommodate the interpretation of (32b) andsimilar cases.3.5 courage, audacity, guts, gall, impudence,chutzpah, gumption, good sense, foresight,wisdom, nerve, stamina, enduranceThis set of nouns describes character traits that ?mani-fest themselves?
in acts that presuppose them.
That is, ifsomeone had the courage to testify, she must have testi-fied.
If she didn?t testify, then she didn?t have the courageto do so, or she lacked whatever other quality the actwould have required in her.
(33) a. Julie had the chutzpah to ask the meter maid fora quarter.b.
I didn?t have the courage to tell her I love her.have COURAGE to X is a + + | ?
?
implicative con-struction.
It also carries the presupposition that the actin question requires the character trait described by thenoun.
Did you have the foresight to invest in Apple?
asks129whether the addressee invested in Apple and presupposesthat it would have been a good idea.
I managed to get thecourage to brave the hot tub has two presuppositions, onecoming from manage to, the other from get the courageto.3.6 hesitation, reluctance, qualms, scruplesLike the simple implicative hesitate to X, un-der negative polarity have/show/display hesita-tion/reluctance/qualms/scruples to X entail thecomplement clause.

(34) a.

Fonseka displayed no reluctance to carry out hisorders.c.
Lauren showed no qualms to confess that shefell for it.3.7 obligation, responsibility, dutyResponsibilities and obligations to do something can beaccepted and taken on, or refused and declined.
The ex-amples in (35) are future-oriented statements.
They donot entail the truth or falsity of the complement clauseat the time referred to by the sentence even if there is aninvited inference about what might or might not be thecase.
(35) a.
The Government accepted the obligation to seethat fair and reasonable wages were paid to rail-waymen.b.
The bank who owns the foreclosed property hasrefused the responsibility to maintain and cleanit up.But statements about meeting or doing an obligation, re-sponsibility or duty are + + | ?

| ?+Table 4: Implicative signatures for verb-noun colloca-tionsThis table lists the implicative signatures of over threehundred phrasal implicative verb-noun collocations.
Onthe level of surface strings the number of constructions isof course much larger because of different tenses for theverb and the many ways of fleshing a noun into a nounphrase.
For example, the verb waste expands to wasted,has wasted, did not waste, etc.
The noun chance expandsto a chanche, the chance, his chance, her last chance, etc.The verb-noun collocations are publicly available.7 Itis a much larger class than the simple implicatives dis-cussed in Section 2 but it is not complete.
From a lin-guistic point of view finding all the specimens is not im-portant if the conceptual classification is done correctly.For computational applications completeness does mat-ter.
We plan to continue to expand the list in the nearfuture.The noun and verb classes discussed in Section 3 con-tain items that are not together in any WordNet (Fellbaum,1998) SYNSET class.
For example, acquit, fulfill, meet,and perform are interchangeable in sentences such as7http://www.stanford.edu/group/csli_lnr/Lexical_Resources/phrasal-implicatives/130(37) a.
He conscientiously acquitted his duty to informand educate the Court.b.
He fulfilled his duty to cremate his deadbrother?s body.c.
The officer met his duty to investigate and hadprobable cause to arrest Kim.As far as WordNet is concerned, the verbs acquit, ful-fill, meet, and perform are totally unrelated.
Neverthe-less they constitute an equivalence class for this particularphrasal implicative collocation, the MEET OBLIGATIONto X construction.The same holds for the noun classes in Section 3.
Theclass in 3.5 includes chutzpah and foresight.
Substitutingforesight for chutzpah in (33a) would retain the entail-ment, that Julie asked the meter maid for a quarter, but itwould bring in a different presupposition.Some computational systems already take advantageof the semantic classification of simple and phrasal im-plicatives.
PARC?s Bridge system (Nairn et al, 2006) im-plements the simple implicatives discussed in Section 2.A few of the phrasal implicatives discussed in Section 3have also been implemented in Bridge (Pichotta, 2008).The NatLog system (MacCartney, 2009) implements thesame simple implicatives as Bridge but in a different way.But neither Bridge nor NatLog does anything with pre-suppositions.
NatLog takes (1b), Kim forgot to resched-ule the meeting, as a paraphrase of what it entails, Kimdid not reschedule the meeting, Bridge doesn?t.
But nei-ther system recognizes the presupposition of intent thatcomes with the construction forget to X.One area that remains to be systematically explored isthe complements of adjectives.
It is known that there arefactive adjectives such as strange, as in It is strange thatFederer has never suffered a major injury, and two-wayimplicative adjectives such as lucky, as in He was lucky tobreak even, and phrasal adjective ++ |??
constructionssuch as see (it) fit to X, as in He saw fit to laugh and sneerat us.Another unexplored topic is phrasal factives such asmake pretense to X that is counterfactive, a paraphrase ofpretend to X.We will address these issues in future work with theLanguage and Natural Reasoning group at CSLI.8AcknowledgmentsThanks to my fellow participants in the Linguistics andNatural Reasoning group at CSLI (Cleo Condoravdi,Stanley Peters, Tania Rojas-Esponda and Annie Zaenen)for their help on the content and style of this article.Thanks also to the four anonymous reviewers of this pa-per for their comments and suggestions.8http://www.stanford.edu/group/csli_lnr/The author gratefully acknowledges the support of De-fense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Ma-chine Reading Program under Air Force Research Lab-oratory (AFRL) prime contract no.
