iSyntactic ProcessingMartin KayXerox Pals Alto Research CenterIn computational linguistics, which began in the1950's with machine translation, systems that arebased mainly on the lexicon have a longer t rad i t ionthan anything e lse - - - fo r  these purposes, twenty f iveyears must be allowed to count as a tradition.
Thebulk of many of the early translation systems was madeup by a dict ionary whose entr ies consisted ofarb i t rary  instruct ions In machine language.
In theearly 60's, computational llnsulsts---at least thosewith theoretical pretentlons---abandoned this way ofdoing business for at least three related reasons:First systems containing large amounts of unrestrictedmachine code fly in the face of ?II principles of goodprogramming practice.
The syntax of the language inwhich linguistic facts are stated is so remote fromtheir semantics that the opportunities for error arevery great and no assumptions can be made ?bout theef fects on the system of Invoking the code associatedwlth any given word.
The systems became virtuallyunmaintainabl?
and eventually fe l l  under their  ownweight.
Furthermore, these failings were magnified assoon as the attempt was made to impose more structureon the overal l  system.
A general backtracking sohsme.for example, could ?11 too easily be thrown intocomplete disarray by an instruct ion in s s ingl ?d ic t ionary  entry  that affected the contro l  stack.Second.
the power of general, and par t i cu la r lynondeterminlstlc, algorithms In syntactic analysiscame to be appreciated, i f  not overappreciated.Suddenly.
I t  was no longer necessary to seek localcr i te r ia  on which to ensure the cor rectness  ofindividual decisions made by the program provided theywere covered by more global c r i te r ia .
Separation ofprogram and l ingu is t i c  data became an overridingpr inciple and.
since i t  was most readi ly applied tosyntactic rules, these became the maln focus ofattent ion.The th i rd ,  and doubtless the most important, reasonfor the change was that syntactic theories in which ?grammar was seen as consisting of ?
set of rules.preferably including transformational rules, capturedthe Imagination of the most i n f luent ia lnonoomputational l ingu is ts ,  and computationall inguists  followed suite i f  only to maintaintheoretical respsotablllty.
In short, Systems withsmall sets of rules in ?
constrained formalism andsimple lex lca l  entr ies apparently made for simpler.cleaner, and more powerful programs while sett ing thewhole enterprise on a sounder theoret ical  footing.The trend is now In the opposite d i rect ion.
There hasbeen a sh i f t  of  emphasis away from highly structuredsystems of complex rules as the pr inciple repositoryof Information ?bout the syntax of ?
language towards?
view In which the responsib i l i ty  ia d istr ibutedamong the lexicon, semantic parts of the l ingu is t i cdescript ion, and ?
cognitive or strategic component,Concomitantly.
Interest  has shifted from algorithmsfor syntactic analysis and generation, tn which thecontrol structure and the exact sequence of events areparamount, to systems in which ?
heavier burden Iscarried by the data structure and in which the ordero~ events is ?
matter of strategy.
This new trend is?
common thread running through several of  the papersin this section,Various techniques for syntactic analysis, not ?s lythose based on some form of Augmented Transit ionNetwork (ATN).

In discussing thesyntactic processors that we have developed, forexample, Ron Kaplan and I no longer flnd it useful tetalk in terms of a parsing algorithm.
There ?re twocentral data structures, a chart and ?n agenda.
Whenadditions tO the chart slve rise to certain kinds ofconfigurations in which some element cont ?
t ,sexecutable code, ?
task is created and placed on the?

Tasks are removed from the agenda andexecuted in an order determined by strategicconsiderations which const i tute part cf  the l ingu is t i ctheory.
Strategy can determine only the order inwhich a l ternat ive analyses are produced.
~anyt rad i t iona l  d is t inct ions ,  such as that between top-down and bottom-up processing, no longer apply to theprocedure as a whole but only to partlcuisr strategiesor the i r  parts.Thls looser or|snlzatlon of programs for syntacticprocessing came.
at least in pert.
from e generallyfe l t  need to break down the boundaries that hadtraditionally separated morphological, syntactic, andsemantic processes.
Research dlrectad towards speechunderstanding systems was quite unable to r?spentthese boundaries because, in the face of unc , r ta i rdata.
local  moves in the analysis on one leverrequired confirmation from other levels so that scommon data structure for ?II levels of  analysis and ?schedule that could change continual ly were of theeseenoe.
Puthermore.
there was a mouvement fromwithin the ar t i f i c ia l - in te l l igence  community toeliminate the boundaries because, frnm thatperspective, they lacked su f f i c ient  theoret icalJus t i f i ca t ion .Zn speech research In part icu lar ,  and ar t i f i c ia lInte l l igence in general, the lexicon took on animportant Position i f  only because i t  la th,~-~e thatthe units or meaning reside.
Recent pro ..sols t ,l ingu is t i c  theory involve s larger role for thelexicon.
