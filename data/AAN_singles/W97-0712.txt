ployed is usually hand-coded and hence arbitraryand incomplete Even when this knowledge hasbeen acqurred automatically, e g (Maybury, 1993,Soderland and Lehnert, 1994), it is apphcatlon-dependent Consequently, despite their occasional74IiiIlII!Idomain-independence (e g (En&es-Nlggemeyer andNeugebauer, 1995, Ono et al,  1994, Rau et al  1993,Sharp, 1991)), NLU approaches are ---on the whole--specmhsed m a particular text-typeFor the demgn of COSY-MATS, a ~o~$c andumfymg approach as been adopted that revolvesboth extrahngmst:c, NLU-type, analysts and selec-tive statmt~cs-based lmgmst:c processing reminiscentof IZ, m co-ordination S~mdarly to NLU, analystsm COSY-MATS is sufl~cmntly deep for the semantic,rhetorical and contextual spects of the input textto be considered m content selection In contrastto what the case ts with such systems, however, thecomputation ofthese d~verse aspects of the text ts ef-ficmnt Thin ts because objective cues on the surfaceof the text are also explmted m COSY-MATS, echoing.

a) theories winch are preoccupmd with thecomrnun:catsng a ents, their goals, plans andbehefs, such as Speech Act Theory (Austin,1962, Searle, 1969), Rhetorical Structure The-ory (RAT) (Mann and Thompson, 1987), or AIresearch on scripts (Lehnert, 1981, Schank andAbelson, 1977) and behef ascnptmn (Wdks andBalhm, 1987)?
?
b) theories on the tracking of the dsscourse h~-tory by means of identlfymg the focused itemsthereto, eg (Grosz, 1986, Hobbs, 1978, Relch-man, 1985, S1dner, 1983, Webber, 1983)?
c) theories of cohesson and coherence and howthese are m~mfested on the surface of the text,e g SysteInlc-~uuctlonal Lmgutstlcs (Halhdayand Hasan, 1976) and the Problem-Solutmn m-formation metastructure (Hoey, 1994, Jordan,1984) (cf (Pmce, 1981))The &verslty of the subject matter covered mthe corpus has meant that specmhsed keywordswere ignored m its analysm Instead the emphastswas placed on functlon words and.regular general-language content words winch are assooated wlththe mstantlatmn of the semantlc, rhetorical andpragmatlc functlous cous~dered Such lemcal xtemscan be employed as markers, not only of the de-velopment of the dmcourse but also of the focusedand central points thereto In thin process, the var-1ous cohesion and coherence theorettlcal frameworkswere very mfluentlal, as were the computatlonal ap-proaches to focus pre&ctmn and identtficatmnAs a result of thin corpus analysm at the sur-.face and more abstract levels, 87 features have beenidentified as relevant to content selectmn and im-portance determmatlon across domains and, largely,text types (Aretoulakt, 1996) Three descnptlvelevels are used for thezr classflicatlon the prag-matzc, the :ntermed:ary and the surface, m decreas-ing order of abstractlon The three levels reflect,m a sense, the three maul trends m dtscourse the-ory identflled Thus,  the 24 pragmatxc features!omm - 'mcatmg agents Pragmatxc features uch as Planand Goat for instance, are remmmcent of AI workon scripts (Sch~nk and Abelson, 1977), Elabora- IItwn and FEzplanatwn can be parallelled to P,.STrela- "ttons (Mann and Thompson, 1987)?
,,developed COSY-MATS (of ectlon 3) To tins ef-fect, a number of mterlevel mappings were identl- |fled both between the pragmatxc and the lower lev- .els, and between the mtermechary and the surfaceClusters of Pragmatic FeaturesFigure 1The intermediary .features (Fig 2) representrhetorical semantxc riteria often employed m theprocessing of focus reformation and m anaphor chs-amblguatlon For example, Topscalzsahon, FocusChange, Cardznahty and Elhps~ have all been usedm computatmnal contexts uch as (Hobbs, 1978, Re-xchman, 1985, Sldner, 1983, Webber, 1983)Finally, the surface features (Fig 3) comcldemostly with exphmt cues m the text wlnch de-note cohesive and coherence relatlous among sen-tences (d  (Li~hn, 1958, Pmce, 1981)) TheFunctzon Word and the Common Content WordPools, for instance, conmst of lemcal 1terns witha semantic/rhetorical load exteuslvely dmcussedm a Systennc-Fauctxonal (Coulthard, 1994) andProblem-Solutxon context (Jordan, 1984, Jordan,!995) Consequently, by using features uch as thesem COSY-MATS, all three levels of language --fromthe low-level surface to the Ingh-level pragmatic--can be CoUectlvely consxdered m order to 'hohstl-cally' determine the unportance ofm&wdual propo-S~tlons m a textApart from tins grouping of the features into dif-ferent levels, the surface and the mterme&ary fea-tures proposed m tins scheme have also been usedto objectify the abstract pragmahc features Tinswas m order to faclhtate the automatic evaluation ofthe latter during the actual operatxon of the fully-levels These mappings were compiled m a manualwhich was used by 5 subjects m encoding texts fromtins corpus (Aretoulakl, i996) The encoded textswere then employed for the empzncal testing of aprototype of the content selection module, reportedm Section 4 Example mappings are given below?
The pragmatic feature Repehtzon m correlatedto the surface features Personal and Possessz~ePronouns and Demonstr~tz~es (Sldner, 1983)It is also associated with the mtermechary FocusChange (Sldner, 1983, Webber, 1983).and El-lspszs (Hovy, 1987) Tins m because the centraltopxcs m a text are often resumed by means of.anaphora, both m the same sentence and lateron m other nnportant.sentences?
The presence of unpersonal phrases m the Pas-ss~e on the surface level m extensively used toexpress a Generahsahon  the pragmatic levelThe latter denotes a central text umt by deft-ration (Gopmk~ 1972, Lehnert, 1981, van Dykand Kmtsch, 1978)?
The surface Negatzon m correlated to the mter-me&ary Contrast (Jordan, 1984)?
Modals such as "should" are also exteusxvelyused on the surface of discourse, when propos-ing, evaluating, or making tentative claims mgeneral Thus, tins feature m also related tothe pragmatic Behef/Doubt, Volttzon/Fear andPlan (cf (Fakumoto and TsUjnl 1994))Ewdence for the usefulness of the mterlevel map-pings proposed m the context of the COSY-MATS con-!76m mClarets of Surfa~ Featmw~gure 3tent selectson feature scheme was provided by vaLsdatmn tests regarding the tunfornnty of the fewture evaluation practices among the human en-coders (Aretoulakl, 1996) The encoding of an iden-tical part of the corpus by means of all the pragmaticfeatures howed that there was a total of 79 6%agreement among the encoders on the evaluation ofthe pragmatic features, using the above-mentionedmanual Consequently, the identified surface .andother less subjective f atures can be fully exploitedlater on for the automation fthe encoding of the ab-stract pragmatic features The vahdatwn tests alsomdtcated that there was 96% agreement on whichof the corpus sentences were m~portant and wlnchnmmportant for the corresponding texts3 A Sca lab le  Arch i tec ture  forIntelligent Sumn~risationHaving identified 'umversal' content selection fea-tures, as well as some of the ways these interact vatheach other, the following arc\]ntecture w~ designedfor a full-scale zmplementation f thecosY-MATSs-mmansatlon shell (Fig 4) (Aretoulala, 1996) Ev-ery sentence m the text to be sttmmansed s is firstprocessed by a cluster of standard symbohc analy-sets, morphological, syntactic, semantsc and prag-matic The resnlt of tlus processing ~s the e~valua -tion o?
