MUC-7 Information Extraction Task DefinitionVersion 5.123 July 1998Nancy Chinchor (mailto:chinchor@gso.saic.com)Source for ST: Elaine Marsh (mailto:marsh@aic.nrl.navy.mil)1.
Brief Definition of Information Extraction TaskInformation extraction in the sense of the Message Understanding Conferences has been traditionally definedas the extraction of information from a text in the form of text strings and processed text strings which areplaced into slots labeled to indicate the kind of information that can fill them.
So, for example, a slot labeledNAME would contain a name string taken directly out of the text or modified in some well-defined way, suchas by deleting all but the person's surname.
Another example could be a slot called WEAPON which requiresas a fill one of a set of designated classes of weapons based on some categorization of the weapons that hasmeaning in the events of import such as GUN or BOMB in a terrorist event.The input to information extraction is a set of texts, usually unclassified newswire articles, and the output is aset of filled slots.
The set of filled slots may represent an entity with its attributes, a relationship between two ormore entities, or an event with various entities playing roles and/or being in certain relationships.
Entities withtheir attributes are extracted in the Template Element task; relationships between two or more entities areextracted in the Template Relation task; and events with various entities playing roles and/or being in certainrelationships are extracted in the Scenario Template task.2.
Motivation and TimingThe overall goal of the Information Extraction (IE) task is to provide an evaluation of IE technology withminimal non-NLP requirements and minimal domain portability overhead.
To enforce the requirements for lowportability overhead, the participant preparation for the evaluation will consist of two stages.
The first stagewill be domain- independent, and will begin well in advance of the evaluation; the second stage of participantpreparation, which is domain-dependent, will start just one month prior to the evaluation.2.1 Domain-Independent Information ExtractionNo set of texts can literally be said to be domain-independent, but an attempt can be made to define informationthat represents a generic "domain" or can be said to belong to most domains of interest.
The extraction ofentities and their attributes as well as facts about those entities constitutes the most domain-independent kind ofinformation extraction.
Template Elements such as organizations and persons with some associated attributescan be extracted from texts without knowing what role or relationships those elements may enter into.
TemplateRelations such as organizations and their locations or persons and the organizations they are employed by canbe extracted to fill a database that could support decision-making at a later time.2.2 Domain-Dependent Information ExtractionA set of texts containing a pre-assigned percentage of articles relevant to a domain, i.e.,articles containing well-defined events, can be used for domain-dependent information extraction.
The same set of texts can also beprocessed without regard to the domain for Template Elements and/or Relations.
However, the ScenarioTemplate task requires more focused information extraction from only relevant texts about events and onlythose entities which participate in the events in defined ways.Scenario Template evaluation is the traditional MUC template-level task, where the participants are evaluatedon whether the templates contain exactly the instantiated objects and filled slots as specified in the scenariodefinition and reflected in the answer key with penalties given for spurious, missing, and wrong objects and slotfills.
The scenario definition is revealed only one month prior to the day that test responses must be submittedto force limitations on the amount of domain-specific work required of the developers for porting from domainto domain or moving from generic information extraction to domain-specific information extraction.3.
General Description of IE Tasks3.1 Template ElementTemplate Element evaluation contains two general Template Element objects: ENTITY and LOCATION.
Thethree types of ENTITY for MUC-7 are ORGANIZATION, PERSON, and ARTIFACT.
One difficulty with theScenario Template task is that it is subject to the "linchpin" or "keystone" effect, where a decision whether toinstantiate an object carries a high penalty if wrong (points off for each slot fill in that object).
We can reducethe linchpin effect by having one or more tasks which do not involve scenario-dependent relevance criteria.Furthermore, this IE task is viewed as an interesting exercise in its own right, as the next step up from theaggregation of the Named Entity task and the Coreference task.For example, for the Template Element evaluation, an ENTITY object of the ORGANIZATION type and allpossible slots defined for that object type are to be instantiated for each organization mentioned in a given text,even if a given Scenario Template task confines itself to organizations which are airplane manufacturers.
Forthe Scenario Template evaluation, only those Template Element object and slot types that appear in thescenario task definition will be tested.
ARTIFACT objects in the Template Element task are handled somewhatdifferently from ORGANIZATION and PERSON objects because there are so many objects mentioned in textsthat can be considered artifacts.
For ARTIFACT objects, the particular kind of artifact to be reported will bedefined and so will the particular slots to be used from the Template Element BNF for ARTIFACT.
TheTemplate Element test for ARTIFACT will be limited to that kind of artifact and to that subset of ARTIFACTslots.For the Template Element task, the following will be provided:BNF DEFINITION.Will include the Template Element objects and slots defined in the fill rules.
Primarily defines the syntax of theobjects and slots.FILL RULES.Will describe the reporting conditions and the semantics of each object and slot.
The Template Element objectswill have minimum conditions and slot descriptions that are available during the first stage of evaluation;additional reporting conditions may be imposed in the fill rules for Template Relations (e.g., instead ofreporting all organizations, the Template Relation task will only require reporting those which are pointed to byrelations) and the fill rules for a particular scenario (e.g., instead of reporting all organizations, a scenario mayonly require reporting airplane manufacturing companies).EXAMPLE BASE.A set of texts with accompanying filled-out templates.3.2 Template RelationTemplate Relation evaluation contains general relational objects which point to Template Element objects.
Thethree relations included in MUC-7 are LOCATION_OF, EMPLOYEE_OF, and PRODUCT_OF.
Onelimitation of the Scenario Template task coupled with the Template Element task in MUC-6 was that relationsbetween entities had to be encoded as attributes or objects in the template.
In the MUC-7 Template Relationtask, these relations or "facts" can be broken out on their own level and be separate from the scenario.Furthermore, this task is viewed as an interesting exercise in its own right, as the next step up from theTemplate Element task and the beginning of a compilation of scenario-independent facts about TemplateElements.For example, for the Template Relation evaluation, a relational object of the LOCATION_OF type and allpossible slots defined for that object type are to be instantiated for each organization whose location is specifiedin a given text, even if a given Scenario Template task confines itself to organizations which are airplanemanufacturers and requires an organization's type but not its location.
On the other hand, for the TemplateRelation evaluation, only those Template Element objects that appear in a Template Relation will be tested.
So,if in a given text, an organization is discussed but none of its employees, products, or locations is mentioned,then that organization need not be included among the Template Elements in the Template Relation task.
Norelational object will point to it, so it can be pruned.For the Template Relation task, the following will be provided:BNF DEFINITION.Will include the Template Relation objects and slots defined in the fill rules.
Primarily defines the syntax of theobjects and slots.FILL RULES.Will describe the reporting conditions and the semantics of each object and slot.
The Template Relation objectswill have minimum conditions and slot descriptions that are available during the first stage of evaluation;additional reporting conditions may be imposed in the fill rules for a particular scenario (e.g., instead ofreporting all organizations with their locations, a scenario may only require reporting airplane manufacturingcompanies)EXAMPLE BASE.A set of texts with accompanying filled-out templates (for Template Relations and any necessary TemplateElements).3.3 Scenario TemplateAn IE scenario task is to identify all information in each input text that is defined to be relevant by the taskdefinition in the scenario Fill Rules document, and to construct a representation of the relevant information inthe format specified by the BNF.For any given IE scenario, the following will be provided:NARRATIVE.Paragraph that briefly describes the scenario topic and the relevance criteria.
The narrative will be used by theevaluation designers in formulating a text retrieval query that will return candidate test set documents from theMUC-7 corpus.BNF DEFINITION.Will include one or more of the Template Element and Template Relation objects or slots defined in thecompanion documents, plus any scenario-specific objects needed for the scenario.
Primarily defines the syntaxof the template.FILL RULES.Will describe the reporting conditions and the semantics of each object and slot.
The Template Element andTemplate Relation objects will have separate minimum conditions and slot descriptions that are availableduring the first stage of evaluation; additional reporting conditions may be imposed in the fill rules for aparticular scenario (e.g., instead of reporting all organizations, a scenario may only require reporting airplanemanufacturing companies).EXAMPLE BASE.A set of texts with accompanying filled-out templates (for all three tasks).4.
Evaluation StagesSTAGE 1 (with the announcement of the evaluation).The participants are given the definitions for the scenario-independent and scenario-neutral template elementsand relations.
The definitions of the scenario-neutral template elements and relations do not reflect therequirements of any particular scenario.
The participants are also given one or more example IE scenariodefinitions and data sets, similar in nature (but not in content) to the Scenario Template task to be used for theactual evaluation.
During stage 1, it is expected that the participants will develop their systems to perform onthe Template Element evaluation task (ENTITY objects) and Template Relation evaluation task (relationalobjects) and will design their system to be able to accommodate the template design requirements of ScenarioTemplate task definitions to be released during stage 2 of the evaluation.STAGE 2 (one month prior to test week).The participants are given one scenario definition.
During the course of this one-month period, the participantsconfigure their system to produce the appropriate subset of the Template Elements (and perhaps TemplateRelations, if appropriate) and to produce the higher-level object(s) as defined in the scenario statement.
Theentire template for any given task is therefore fairly simple, consisting of one or more Template Elementobjects, only one scenario-specific (high-level) object, and perhaps one or more scenario- specific(intermediate-level) objects.
Template Relation objects may be used if appropriate.
The number of scenario-specific slots (other than pointer slots) that do not come from the set of Template Elements or Relations will befive or less.STAGE 3 (test week)The participants are given the test texts.5.
Levels of Template StructureFour levels of template objects are defined:LEVEL 1 (Template Element).The objects and slots defined in this document.
These are generic Template Elements which may play a role invirtually any task scenario.
These template elements are not oriented towards any particular task, but insteadattempt to capture the sort of information that may be needed for a wide range of tasks.
All of these objects arefairly simple and have no relational information (i.e., no pointers to other objects).
For a given IE relation orscenario, only a subset of the predefined Template Element objects will be used.LEVEL 2 (Template Relation).The relations are objects which define a relation between generic Template Elements.
For example, a relationalobject may consist of a pointer to an ORGANIZATION ENTITY object (generic) and a pointer to a PERSONENTITY object (generic).
The specific role of the employee in the organization will not necessarily berepresented at the template relation level.
In a scenario template the employee relationship might be indicatedand additionally a slot representing the role that the person has in that organization (scenario-specific), and,perhaps, a slot containing temporal information (generic).LEVEL 3 (Scenario Template Object).For each IE scenario, it is envisioned that there will be exactly one scenario-specific object type.
It captures theessential event of interest in the task.
This object type will have pointers to the Template Element object typesappropriate for the task, as well as pointers to any Relational objects defined for the task.LEVEL 4 (Top-Level Template Object).For each text in the Scenario Template task, there will be exactly one Top-Level Template object.
If the text isrelevant to an IE scenario, it will identify the text and will contain one or more pointers to Scenario Templateobjects.
If the text is not relevant to the IE scenario, it will identify the text and will contain no pointers toScenario Template objects.6.
Fill Format6.1 Slot TypesThere are four kinds of slots in the template: set fill, string fill, normalized fill, and index fill (pointer).
It shouldbe noted that for purposes of scoring, normalized fills and string fills are equivalent, i.e., the scoring softwarestrips off external double quotes from fills for slots that are defined as taking normalized fills or string fills.SET FILL.To be filled in by selection from a prespecified list of categories defined in the fill rules for a given slot.STRING FILL.To be filled in with an exact copy of a text string from the article under analysis.
The fill may be enclosed indouble quotes, if desired.
See the "Tokenization Rules" document for information on what counts as a wordtoken in certain special cases.NORMALIZED FILL.To be filled with a text string that is converted to a canonical form in accordance with the fill rules for a givenslot.
The fill may be enclosed in double quotes, if desired.INDEX FILL (POINTER).To be filled with the index of an object, i.e., a pointer to an object.
The fill is to be enclosed in angled brackets.6.2 Object IdentifiersAll objects are identified by the object name (from the template BNF), the document number (from the DOCIDtag in the text), and a one-up number; a dash is used to separate those three elements.
For all articles, anypunctuation or alphabetic characters internal to the value of DOCID must be suppressed; thus, a validORGANIZATION object identifier for DOCID nyt960102.0516 would be <ORGANIZATION-9601020516-1>.6.3 Notation Reserved for Use in Answer KeysLegitimate ambiguity or vagueness in the text is reflected in the answer key by the presence of alternativeacceptable fills.
The "/" notation is reserved for this use; such fills are *not* to be generated by the systemunder evaluation.
The notation allows the answer key to present alternate acceptable single fills for a slot,alternate sets of fills for a slot, optional fills (one fill or zero fills), and combinations thereof.
An object istreated as optional if all pointers to it are either optional or in a list of alternatives.Since the Template Element task does not include the creation of pointers to the template element objects, theoptionality of ENTITY objects is indicated via the OBJ_STATUS slot within the optional object itself.
TheOBJ_STATUS slot is not used for the Scenario Template task.
Template Relations which are optional are alsoindicated via the OBJ_STATUS slot.
If TE's are optional and referred to by any TR, the scorer automaticallymake the TR optional.
The annotator of the answer key does not need to keep track of the status of lower levelobjects during the extraction of Template Relations.The COMMENT slot may contain notes that the analyst wants to record concerning the answer key.
The slot isnot scored.
(Analysts should avoid entering double quotes within the body of the comment, as they will preventthe template-filling tool, Tabula Rasa, from being able to reload the template file.)7.
Document Sections for Information ExtractionThe input texts for MUC-7 from the New York Times News Service contain some SGML tags.
Although thearticles come from different news publications, the formatting is uniform.
The IE task is to be performed on thetext delimited by the <SLUG>,<DATE>, <NWORDS>, <PREAMBLE>, <TEXT>, <TRAILER> tags.8.
Description of Task Defining DocumentsFor MUC-7, there are three companion documents which define the individual tasks: Template Element,Template Relation, and Scenario Template.
Each document is updated during the course of the evaluation yearand all changes are marked with change bars which refer to the most previous version number of the document.No changes will be made without a change in the version number and date of the document.
The IE documentsare organized in a FrameMaker book together with this overview, but can be printed separately by those siteswho are participating in a subset of the IE tasks.9.

Include alsovariants of the proper name.
There may be more than one value for this slot.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:At least one form of the organization/person name or artifact identifier must appear in the text.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
This slot has a 0 or more valence to allow the situation where an unnamed entity participates in an event(or relation) of interest and is perhaps referenced only by a descriptive phrase.2.
If an organization is changing name, report both the current name as ENT_NAME and the past or futurename as ENT_NAME.3.
See "Named Entity Task Definition" for information on treatment of names such as "McDonald's ofJapan."4.
The guidelines for instantiating a PERSON type are the same as the guidelines given in "Named EntityTask Definition" for annotating person names.5.
Aliases and misspelled variants of the name are also to be reported in ENT_NAME.6.
For organizations, include any corporate designators (see reference document titled "MUC-7 Table ofCorporate Designator Abbreviations").7.
For artifacts include only proper names of vehicles.
Series numbers are considered part of the propername as are manufacturers (in most cases).9.2.1.2 ENT_TYPE SlotDEFINITION:Categorization of entity as an organization, person, or artifactMINUMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:The ENT_TYPE fill should never be left blank.9.2.1.3 ENT_CATEGORY SlotDEFINITION:Further categorization of entity depending on whether it is an organization, person, or artifactMINUMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:The ENT_CATEGORY fill should be based on evidence from the text or on world knowledge; the slot shouldnever be left blank.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
The categories for an ENTITY of ENT_TYPE ORGANIZATION to be used for ENT_CATEGORY aredefined as follows:ORG_GOVT -- the government of a country, state, municipality, etc., or government body such as agovernment ministry, agency, commission, or committee.
In the case of a string such as "IBM announceda joint venture with China," report "China" as type ORG_GOVT unless there is evidence for a differenttype elsewhere in the text.ORG_CO -- any profit-making or nonprofit legal (usually) entity, including universities, partnerships,corporations, proprietorships, consortiums, enterprises, government-owned corporations, etc.ORG_OTHER -- organizational entities that do not fit the above categories, such as "the Apache Indiantribe," "OPEC," "the Medellin cartel," "NATO."2.
The categories for an ENTITY of ENT_TYPE PERSON to be used for ENT_CATEGORY are definedas follows:PER_MIL -- a person who is a member of the military.PER_CIV -- an (unincorporated) person who is known or assumed to be a civilian or a family.
This fill isthe default for persons.3.
The categories for an ENTITY of ENT_TYPE ARTIFACT to be used for ENT_CATEGORY aredefined as follows:ART_AIR -- a vehicle that primarily travels by air or into outer space, such as an airplane, helicopter, orspace shuttle.ART_GROUND -- a vehicle that primarily travels on the ground, such as a car or tank.ART_WATER -- a vehicle that primarily travels through water, such as a ship or submarine.Note that artifacts in MUC-7 are limited to vehicles.9.2.1.4 ENT_DESCRIPTOR SlotDEFINITION:Noun phrase describing or referring to an entity without naming it.
This slot is not permitted to have more thanone value.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:Text must provide a string that describes the entity and that does not fit the definition of the ENT_NAME slot.Strings that are used in the article to describe a set of entities are not candidates for this slot, e.g., "the two newsubsidiaries," "both commanders," or "two civilian 737s.
"Thus, the following types of strings do not qualify as descriptors:1.
Strings that describe a set of persons, organizations, or artifacts, e.g., "Spokesmen for both the union and thecompany," "ABC Corp. and XYZ Corp. are [partners in a new joint venture].
", where the string in brackets isnot a descriptor.2.
Nonspecific references, e.g., the bracketed NP in the following sentences: "That post is typically filled by [acareer foreign-service officer who has broad responsibilities for overseeing the daily work of the U.S.diplomatic corps].
", "The contract will go to [a minority-owned company].
", and "The Boeing 757 is [a twin-engine, medium- to long-range jetliner that can carry up to 239 passengers, depending on cabin configuration]."3.
References that are only potentially true of the individual, organization, or vehicle, e.g., "X may be anappealing choice for the job," "Y was nominated commissioner," "X was grooming Y to be his replacement,""ABC Corp. may be [a big winner]," "According to early reports, the ill-fated DEF 123 aircraft may have been[a single-engine plane]" and depictions that are denied to be true, e.g., "Z denied that he was a candidate," "Thesuspected car was not a foreign made vehicle"NOTE: There are some borderline cases, where it's not clear whether the predicate ("believed to be", "selection[for]", "emerging[as]" should be understood as factual or speculative/potential:"[The likely board candidate] is believed to be Mr. Byrne" (Coded as descriptor, but would have been optionalif it had been the ONLY descriptor for Mr. Byrne in the text)"the president's ill-fated selection of Zoe Baird for [attorney general]" (the article later mentions that she hassince withdrawn her name -- thus "attorney general" not coded as descriptor)"X is emerging as [a leading candidate to succeed James Robinson III]" (Coded as descriptor)"The New York Daily News named Lou Colasuonno to be [editor of the newspaper]."
(Coded as descriptor)SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:A.
For ENT_DESCRIPTOR of organizations:1.
This slot is intended to capture information on the organization other than its name or alias.
Therefore, thestring fill for this slot is not permitted to contain the name or alias, which means that the fill will sometimes bea substring of a full noun phrase.
The substring could be a premodifier noun or noun phrase or a head noun ornoun phrase; it cannot be a non-NP (e.g., cannot be a possessive, prepositional phrase, or a pure adjective).Below are a few examples of complex NPs with descriptor substrings:"the law firm Smith Blarney" (descriptor is "the law firm")"ABC Corp's XYZ subsidiary" (descriptor is "subsidiary")2.
The answer key will not contain any "insubstantial" descriptors, which includes pronouns (e.g., "it") andsimple noun phrases whose head is one of the following nouns:"administration""agency""board""committee""company""concern""corporation""firm""government""institution""unit""squadron"By "simple noun phrases," we mean ones that consist only of the bare head and ones that are modified only bya determiner (e.g., "the," "his," "this") or by an optional determiner and a proper noun string containing thename/alias of the company in question.
Taking the word "unit" as an example, the following usages of it wouldbe regarded as insubstantial, where the expressions constitute the complete NP:"unit" (as a bare noun, perhaps in a headline)"the unit""his unit""that unit""the ABC Corp. unit" (where "unit" refers to "ABC Corp.")"XYZ Corp.'s ABC Corp. unit" ("unit" refers to "ABC Corp.")As a consequence of this guideline, an ORGANIZATION ENTITY object will not be instantiated if the textprovides no name and if the only descriptive information on it is an insubstantial descriptor.3.
All other descriptive noun phrases will be included as alternatives in the answer key.
Thus, even the"insubstantial" head nouns listed above may occur in substantial noun phrases.
For example, the followingusages of "unit" would be regarded as substantial, and the entire phrase would be generated asENT_DESCRIPTOR:"a unit of ABC Corp.""the ABC Corp. unit" (where "unit" refers to an organization *other* than "ABC Corp.")"the new unit""the New York unit""the unit based in New York"4.
The answer key will contain alternative fills when the full NP contains one of the following types ofmodifiers/adjuncts, which are considered to be either of no interest to the database or of questionable parse andlimited interest to the database:a. possessive pronoun premodifier, e.g., "its most profitable subsidiary" (alternate fill is "most profitablesubsidiary")b. temporal adverbials, e.g., "now the most profitable subsidiary" (alternate fill is "most profitable subsidiary")c. loose adjunct, e.g., a nonrestrictive relative clause or similar type of full or reduced clause, as in "theprofitable subsidiary, which announced increased earnings again this quarter" (alternative fill is "the profitablesubsidiary") or "the profitable subsidiary, being the second-smallest of all the company'ssubsidiaries" (alternative fill is "the profitable subsidiary")5.
To qualify as a descriptor, the noun phrase does not have to be definite (e.g., it may be modified by theindefinite article "a").
Thus, the phrases enclosed between asterisks in the following examples are allowablefills for ENT_DESCRIPTOR for General Dynamics Corp.:"*A major government contracting firm* announced today that it has won a new contract.
General DynamicsCorp.
said...""General Dynamics Corp. is *a major government contracting firm*.
""General Dynamics Corp., *a major government contracting firm*, ..."B.
For ENT_DESCRIPTOR of persons:1.
To qualify as a descriptor, a noun phrase must refer either to the person per se or to the person's professionalrole (or other functional role).
Some references to a person's role are made indirectly, e.g., by the use of "as,""work as," "job of":"The choice of a successor to James Robinson III as [American Express Co.'s chairman]" (bracketed NP isdescriptor of "James Robinson III")"Mr. Tarnoff worked as [a top State Department aide in the Carter administration]."2.
This slot is intended to capture information on the person other than its name or alias.
Therefore, the stringfill for this slot is not permitted to contain the name or alias, which means that the fill will sometimes be asubstring of a full noun phrase.
The substring could be a premodifier noun or noun phrase or a head noun ornoun phrase; it cannot be a non-NP (e.g., cannot be a possessive, prepositional phrase, or a pure adjective).Below are a couple examples of complex NPs with descriptor substrings:"President Clinton" (descriptor is "President")"Democratic lawyer Tom Donilon" (descriptor is "Democratic lawyer")3.
The answer key will not contain any "insubstantial" descriptors, which includes personal pronouns and basictitles.
As a consequence, a PERSON ENTITY object will not be instantiated if the text provides no name and ifthe only descriptive information on it is an insubstantial descriptor.
The following titles are consideredinsubstantial: "Mr.", "Ms.", "Miss", "Sir", "Dr.", "Mrs.", "Prof."4.
All other modifying/referring noun phrases will be considered "substantial" and will be included asalternatives in the answer key.
In cases of conjoined descriptors, the key will contain alternative fillsrepresenting each conjunct separately as well as the conjoined phrase, unless the conjuncts share a modifier.
"Hank Gutman, [[the chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation] and [a former Treasuryofficial]]" (three alternative descriptors)"The choice of a successor to James Robinson III as [American Express Co.'s chairman and chief executiveofficer]" (one descriptor)5.
The answer key will contain alternative fills when the full NP contains one of the following types ofmodifiers/adjuncts, which are considered to be either of no interest to the database or of questionable parse andlimited interest to the database:a. possessive pronoun premodifier, e.g., "his Army counterpart" (alternate fill is "Army counterpart")b. temporal adverbials, e.g., "now CEO of United Airlines" (alternate fill is "CEO of United Airlines")c. loose adjunct, e.g., a nonrestrictive relative clause or similar type of full or reduced clause, as in "one seniorNavy officer, who asked to remain anonymous" (alternative fill is "one senior Navy officer")6.
To qualify as a descriptor, the noun phrase does not have to be marked definite (does not have to be markedwith "the").
Thus, the bracketed phrases in the following examples are allowable fills:"[Another potential choice for a top position in the State Department] is [Democratic lawyer] Tom Donilon"7.
Time-dependent descriptors qualify as fills for the descriptor slot.
"Peter Tarnoff, [president of the Council on Foreign Relations], ... Mr. Tarnoff was [a career foreign serviceofficer from 1961 until 1982]."
(two descriptors for Tarnoff)8.
When a person is identified only by description, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether repeated mention ofthe description refers to the same person or to a different person.
In such cases, the answer key will representthe information in two separate objects, one of which is marked as optional.
"Last week [a spokesman for American] agreed that there was continuing progress in the negotiations with theflight attendants, but [a spokesman] said the company believed that a mediator "would help.""
(In this example,the two bracketed NPs clearly refer to different persons, and the key would contain two separate objects, bothobligatory.
)"As disruptions occur down the road, we need to protect ourselves and our revenues," [a company spokesman]said.
... Last week [a spokesman for American] agreed that there was continuing progress in the negotiationswith the flight attendants."
(For this text, the key would contain two identical objects, one of them optional,because the first bracketed NP may refer to the same person as the second bracketed NP.
The actual text thatinspired this example was more complicated and was not coded as described here)"Mr. Campeau's strategy is to keep the most valuable assets, [a Wall Street source] said.
"It's a soundplan," [the source] said.
... [A Wall Street source] said Mr. Campeau "was approached by another partyindicating a strong interest and possibility of acquiring" Ann Taylor and Brooks Brothers.
"The implication isthat he tried to sell and couldn't because the price was too high," said [the source].
...
In addition to sellingAllied assets, Campeau has embarked on a program to divest itself of Campeau assets in the U.S. and Canada,[a Wall Street source] said, "to give him additional liquidity to meet some of his bank requirements."
In theU.S.
Campeau owns property on the West Coast, including an office building in San Francisco and real estatein Silicon Valley, and some Texas real estate, [the source] said.
(For this text, the key would contain threeidentical objects, two of them optional.)C.
For ENT_DESCRIPTOR of artifacts:1.
This slot is intended to capture information on the artifact other than its unique identifier or alias.
The stylefor specifying a vehicle varies dependent upon whether the vehicle is one of a kind, such as ships and spaceshuttles, or the vehicle is mass produced with only small variations within a model line, such as automobiles,airplanes, and helicopters.
The string fill for this slot is not permitted to contain the unique identifier or alias forvehicles that are one of a kind, which means that the fill will sometimes be a substring of a full noun phrase.The substring could be a premodifier noun or noun phrase or a head noun or noun phrase; it cannot be a non-NP (e.g., cannot be a possessive, prepositional phrase, or a pure adjective).
Below are a few examples ofcomplex NPs with descriptor substrings:"the space shuttle Challenger" (descriptor is "the space shuttle")"the Italian luxury liner Andrea Doria" (descriptor is "the Italian luxury liner")"his square-rigger Golden Hind" (one of the alternate descriptors is "his square-rigger")In the case of a non-unique identifier, such as the model name or an alias for the model name, the string fill forthis slot is permitted to contain the identifier.
A few examples of such descriptors follow with their entitynames:"the twin-engine, two-seat Tomcat" (entity name is "Tomcat")"a chartered 757 aircraft" (entity name is "757")2.
The answer key will not contain any "insubstantial" descriptors, which includes pronouns (e.g., "it") andsimple noun phrases whose head is one of the following nouns:"airplane""aircraft""plane""helicopter""car""ship""boat""vehicle""equipment"By "simple noun phrases," we mean ones that consist only of the bare head and ones that are modified only bya determiner (e.g., "the," "his," "this") or by an optional determiner and a proper noun string containing thename/alias of the artifact in question.
Taking the word "plane" as an example, the following usages of it wouldbe regarded as insubstantial, where the expressions constitute the complete NP:"plane" (as a bare noun, perhaps in a headline)"the plane""his plane""that plane""the Boeing 737 plane" (where "plane" refers to "Boeing 737")"XYZ Airline's Boeing 737 plane" ("plane" refers to "Boeing 737")As a consequence of this guideline, an ARTIFACT ENTITY object will not be instantiated if the text providesno name and if the only descriptive information on it is an insubstantial descriptor.3.
All other descriptive noun phrases will be included as alternatives in the answer key.
Thus, even the"insubstantial" head nouns listed above may occur in substantial noun phrases.
For example, the followingusages of "plane" would be regarded as substantial, and the entire phrase would be generated asENT_DESCRIPTOR:"a plane modeled on the Boeing 737""the new plane"4.
The answer key will contain alternative fills when the full NP contains one of the following types ofmodifiers/adjuncts, which are considered to be either of no interest to the database or of questionable parse andlimited interest to the database:a. possessive pronoun premodifier, e.g., "his square-rigger" (alternate fill is "square-rigger")b. temporal adverbials, e.g., "now the last-flying B-29" (alternate fill is "the last-flying B-29")c. loose adjunct, e.g., a nonrestrictive relative clause or similar type of full or reduced clause, as in "the 31st offthe assembly line, out of a total 694 produced to date" (alternative fill is "the 31st off the assembly line")5.
To qualify as a descriptor, the noun phrase does not have to be definite (e.g., it may be modified by theindefinite article "a").
Thus, the phrases enclosed between asterisks in the following examples are allowablefills for ENT_DESCRIPTOR for Commander Bates' plane that crashed outside of Nashville:"an F-14A "Tomcat" fighter jet""an F-14 from Squadron 213"9.2.2 LOCATION ObjectDEFINITION:LOCATION is a task-independent object that is separate from the predefined ENTITY object.
It may bedefined selectively for a given scenario or relation, e.g., to provide the location of an event or ENTITY.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:The text must supply a fill for LOCALE.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
This object will be part of the Template Element evaluation.
One or more of them may play a role in one ormore Template Relation or Scenario Template tasks.
In such cases, their role will be defined in the TemplateRelation or Scenario Template task documentation.9.2.2.1 LOCALE SlotDEFINITION:Specific place where an entity is located.
To enable accurate, automatic scoring, only the most specific place isto be reported unless the locale is of type AIRPORT.
The literal string that appears in the text appears in thisslot.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:The locale name must be specifically mentioned in the text in either noun or adjective form.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
The "MUC-7 Reference Gazetteer" does not contain an exhaustive list of the place names that may be usedto fill the LOCALE slot, nor does it usually provide alternative spellings for place names.
If the place name isgiven in the text in adjective form, e.g., "Philadelphian," and does not appear anywhere in the text in nounform, e.g., "Philadelphia," report the name in adjective form.2.
If the text provides only a relative locale such as "near Tokyo" or "60 miles from Tokyo", report "Tokyo" asLOCALE.3.
If the locale is an airport, aliases are expected to be given as multiple fills rather than listing only the mostcomplete or most specific name given in the article.9.2.2.2 LOCALE_TYPE SlotDEFINITION:A categorization of the place name that appears in the LOCALE slot.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:The LOCALE slot must be filled.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
The location categories that are to be used for LOCALE_TYPE are defined as follows:CITY -- a town, city, port, suburb, or other local settlementPROVINCE -- a state, province, island or similar subnational geographically or politically defined areaCOUNTRY -- a nation, country, colony, federation of countries such as the Confederation of IndependentStates (the former USSR), or other similar national entityREGION -- an international region such as Eastern Europe, the Pacific Rim, or the Malay ArchipelagoWATER -- a body of water such as the Atlantic Ocean or the Straits of Florida.AIRPORT -- an area of land normally set aside for air traffic takeoffs and landings.UNK -- a location whose possible type cannot be identified from evidence in the text or from world knowledge.Use UNK as locale type only if the type cannot be determined from the text.2.
The "MUC-7 Reference Gazetteer" uses more location categories than are to be reported inLOCALE_TYPE.
The following mappings apply:PORT in gazetteer is to be reported as CITY.ISLAND in gazetteer is to be reported as PROVINCE.ISLAND-GROUP in gazetteer is to be reported as either PROVINCE (if part of a single country) or asREGION (if part of an international region).CONTINENT in gazetteer is to be reported as REGION.9.2.2.3 COUNTRY SlotDEFINITION:The country or region in which LOCALE is located.
A defining list of names is contained in "MUC-7 Countryand Region List."
(This list contains only canonical forms.
NLP system developers must define their ownmappings from the "MUC-7 Reference Gazetteer" and/or other gazetteer resources to this list.
)MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:To be filled if LOCALE is filled, even if fill must be inferred.
Also to be filled if country can be inferred fromcertain other text expressions (see item 5 under Special Usage Notes, below).SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
If LOCALE_TYPE is filled in by COUNTRY or REGION, report the name in this slot as a normalized formdrawn from "MUC-7 Country and Region List".2.
Adjective forms such as "Asian" and "Japanese" should be mapped to the noun form on the list, and the nounform should be used as the slot fill.3.
Note that the "MUC-7 Country and Region List" may not contain a complete list of countries and regions.
Ifa canonical form for the name of the country or region does not appear on the list, report the name in noun oradjective form (whichever appears in the text) as a string fill.4.
As a default, assume that "American" refers to "United States."5.
Certain text expressions that indicate an organization's country, such as "the domestic" and "the nation's" inthe examples below, occasion the COUNTRY slot to be filled, if the country referent can be inferred.
"the domestic" <org> /* "the domestic company" */"the nation's" <org> /* "the nation's largest carrier" */6.
A body of water outside the boundaries of any country or region, such as an ocean, should be reported as astring fill from the text.
For example,"the Pacific" (COUNTRY slot fill is "Pacific")"the Mediterranean Sea" (COUNTRY slot fill is "Mediterranean Sea")"the Mediterranean" (COUNTRY slot fill is "Mediterranean")9.3 Known Inadequacies of the NotationConjoined names with elision, such as "John and Sally Smith" and "President and Mrs. Reagan", present aspecial problem for extraction because the text that should go in the name slot is not contiguous and other rulesintercede that cause unexpected conflations of entities.The current version of Tabula Rasa used for generating the answer key templates allows only one offset rangeper fill.
Although, in the current evaluation, the scorer ignores offsets in scoring, they will be used inapplications which display texts.
So for MUC-7, we require that only contiguous strings be used whereverstring fills are allowed.In the case of "John and Sally Smith", instantiate two entities, one with ENT_NAME "John" and the other withENT_NAME "Sally Smith."
In the case of "President and Mrs. Reagan", instantiate two entities, one withENT_DESCRIPTOR "President" and no fill for ENT_NAME and the other with the misleading fill forENT_NAME of "Reagan" and no fill for ENT_DESCRIPTOR because "Mrs." is insubstantial.Clearly, the issue of conjunction with elision needs to be resolved because the resulting database entries areunlikely to come to mind during the composition of database queries, especially the entry for "Mrs. Reagan"since it would conflate with the normally expected entry for her husband.
Perhaps Template Relations withinthe database would help to clarify matters with the current rules still in effect.APPENDIX A.

Times News Service</PREAMBLE><TEXT><p>WASHINGTON &MD; The squadron commander of the F-14 pilot in the Nashville crash that killed fivepeople last week has been relieved of his command, the Navy announced Sunday.<p>Citing three accidents over the last year, the Navy decided to reassign the commander, Fred Kilian, because of``a loss of trust and confidence'' in his ability to lead the squadron, said a spokesman, Comdr.
Gregg Hartung.<p>Fighter Squadron 213, a 14-plane unit based in Miramar Naval Base near San Diego, had developed by far theworst safety record among the Navy's 13 F- 14 squadrons, with four crashes over the last 16 months, three afterKilian became its leader.
<p>A Navy officer said that Kilian had an ``excellent reputation.''
<p>"But in the Navy," the officer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, ``we hold people accountable forthings that happen during the time of their command.
In this particular case, this particular squadron has anexceptionally high accident rate, higher than any other."
<p>The officer said the decision to reassign Kilian to the Pacific headquarters of the Navy's Fighter Wing wasmade Saturday by the commander of Carrier Air Wing 11, Capt.
Dennis Gillespie.
<p>Kilian could not be reached for comment.
<p>In the latest crash, an F-14 from Squadron 213 plunged to the ground immediately after takeoff on Jan. 29,killing the pilot, Lt. Comdr.
John Stacy Bates, the jet's radar operator Lt. Graham Alden Higgins, and threecivilians in a house the plane crashed into.
<p>Bates had crashed an F-14 into the Pacific during a routine training flight in April.
Navy officials blamed himfor causing the accident, in which no one was hurt, by losing control, but forgave him because they felt he wasdisplaying the sort of aggressive flying style the Navy encourages.

Template Relation Task Object Definition10.1 BNF/* Template Relation Objects -- apply to Template Relation task; apply selectively to Scenario Template task */<PRODUCT_OF> :=ARTIFACT: <ENTITY>-ORGANIZATION: <ENTITY>-OBJ_STATUS: {OPTIONAL}-COMMENT: " "-<EMPLOYEE_OF> :=PERSON: <ENTITY>-ORGANIZATION: <ENTITY>-OBJ_STATUS: {OPTIONAL}-COMMENT: " "-<LOCATION_OF> :=LOCATION: <LOCATION>-ORGANIZATION: <ENTITY>-OBJ_STATUS: {OPTIONAL}-COMMENT: " "-10.2 Fill Rules10.2.1 General Template Relation ObjectDEFINITION:Relationship between two entities.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:Objects are Template Elements.
See MUC-7 Template Element Task Definition.
Objects are in the definedrelationship.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
Existence dependencies.Entities may be created or cease to exist during the time covered in the article.
These changes may havean effect on the instantiation of a relationship.2.
Time dependencies.Only the current relationship is to be reported.
Current time can be either the time of the article or thetime of the story being told within the article depending on the style.3.
Implication by form.A relationship can be inferred from the format of the article.4.
Inference versus world knowledge.The extracted information must be locatable or linked to something in the text.
The use of worldknowledge in inferencing from information contained in the text is expected during informationextraction, but information outside of the text should not be entered in the fills.
This distinction istenuous, but it is reasonable and necessary.
The evaluation is not a measure of the system's amount ofworld knowledge, but a measure of its ability to extract specified material from the text.5.
Valencies.Some entities may be in more than one relationship.
Each object represents one relationship.6.
Granularity.Some entities may be proper parts of larger entities.
The usage notes will specify which level on thishierarchy should be chosen to represent the relationship.
The annotators may decide to allow leniency byputting alternatives or optionals here to avoid the linchpin effect.10.2.2 PRODUCT_OF ObjectDEFINITION:Relationship between an artifact and an organization entity.
The artifact is a product of the organization.
Anartifact is a product of an organization if that organization created the product for sale.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:Both the ORGANIZATION and ARTIFACT entities must appear in the text and be filled as template elements.The relation points to these objects.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
Existence dependencies.Artifacts that are produced or destroyed during the time of the article can be reported as products of theorganization mentioned as their maker.2.
Time dependencies.Only the current maker of the product is to be reported.3.
Implication by form.A modifier of an artifact name can be reported in the PRODUCT_OF relation.
For example, if the onlytime an airplane's manufacturer is mentioned is inside the artifact name, it can be reported as follows:``Here comes my ride!''
Ross shouted as the McDonnell Douglas MD Explorer came into sight.<ENTITY-9601290937-6> :=ENT_NAME: "McDonnell Douglas"ENT_TYPE: ORGANIZATIONENT_CATEGORY: ORG_CO<ENTITY-9601290937-18> :=ENT_NAME: "McDonnell Douglas MD Explorer"ENT_TYPE: ARTIFACTENT_DESCRIPTOR: "SUPERCHOPPER"/ "my ride"/ "CHOPPER"ENT_CATEGORY: ART_AIR<PRODUCT_OF-9601290937-1> :=ARTIFACT: <ENTITY-9601290937-18>ORGANIZATION: <ENTITY-9601290937-6>4.
Inference versus world knowledge.For example, if GM and Chevrolet are mentioned in an article and a Chevrolet is an artifact, the articlemust imply that Chevrolet is part of GM for GM to be allowed as the maker.
(See 6.
below.)5.
Valencies.Some organizations may appear as the maker of more than one artifact.
A separate template relationshould be instantiated for each artifact.6.
Granularity.If an artifact is made by part of an organization and the larger organization is reported, the largestorganization reported must appear as the maker and the part of the organization that made the artifactmay be reported, too, but it is not necessary.
For example, if both GM and Chevrolet are mentioned in anarticle with Chevrolet as a division of GM and a Chevrolet is an artifact, the artifact must be reported as aproduct of GM.
The key will also allow the system to report the Chevrolet as a product of Chevrolet (adivision of GM), but it is not penalized if it does not report it.10.2.3 EMPLOYEE_OF ObjectDEFINITION:A relationship between a person and an organization entity.
The person is an employee of the organization, thatis, the person works for the organization in return for financial compensation.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:Both the ORGANIZATION and PERSON entities must appear in the text and be filled as template elements.The person must work for the organization in return for financial compensation.
The relation points to theseobjects.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
Existence dependencies.If a person dies while in the employment of an organization, the EMPLOYEE_OF relationship is to bereported.
For example, a stewardess of a TWA plane that crashes who is killed in the crash is stillreportable as an employee of the airline.2.
Time dependencies.Only the current employment relationship is to be reported.
Current time can be either the time of thearticle or the time of the story being told within the article depending on the style.
If someone haschanged companies or retired prior to the time of the article or story, the EMPLOYEE_OF relationship isnot reportable.
For example, Edward L. Beach is not an employee of the Navy at the time reported on inthe article of 2 January 1996.<ENTITY-9601020516-17> :=ENT_NAME: "Edward L. Beach"ENT_TYPE: PERSONENT_DESCRIPTOR: "a retired Navy captain and author of a 1994 book defending Kimmel and Short"/ "a retired Navy captain"/ "author of a 1994 book defending Kimmel and Short"ENT_CATEGORY: PER_CIV/ PER_MILTime dependencies can be unclear.
For example, both positions seem to be current in"Mary Smith, [president of IBM] was promoted to [CEO of AT&T]"The MUC-7 Coreference Task Definition discusses time dependencies, but there is no satisfactorytreatment in any of the MUC-7 task definitions including this one.3.
Implication by form.A relationship can be inferred from the format of the article.
In the keys, the writer of an article is linkedto the newspaper even though there is no statement that the journalist is an employee of the newspaper.For example, the following preamble is enough to make the EMPLOYEE_OF relationship for the authorvalid.<PREAMBLE>BC-FIGHTER-CRASHES-300&ADD-NYTNAVY SQUADRON COMMANDER PLAGUED BY CRASHES REASSIGNED(kd)By JOHN O'NEILc.1996 N.Y. Times News Service</PREAMBLE><EMPLOYEE_OF-9602040136-2> :=PERSON: <ENTITY-9602040136-8>ORGANIZATION: <ENTITY-9602040136-3><ENTITY-9602040136-8> :=ENT_NAME: "JOHN O'NEIL"ENT_TYPE: PERSONENT_CATEGORY: PER_CIV<ENTITY-9602040136-3> :=ENT_NAME: "N.Y. Times News Service"ENT_TYPE: ORGANIZATIONENT_CATEGORY: ORG_CO4.
Inference versus world knowledge.The extracted information must be locatable or linked to something in the text.
The use of worldknowledge in inferencing from information contained in the text is expected during informationextraction, but information outside of the text should not be entered in the fills.
So just because thesystem may know that Michael Jordan plays for the Chicago Bulls, if there is nothing in the text thatimplies this relationship, then the relationship is not reportable.
However, if a human reader can inferfrom the context that a player is on a professional team, the relationship must be reported.
For example,Aldred should be reported as an employee of the Tigers because of the following excerpt:Gross fared better than Aldred.
Tigers manager Buddy Bell announced after the game Aldred was beingsent to the bullpen.5.
Valencies.Some entities may be in more than one relationship.
An organization has many employees and aconsultant can be an employee of several companies at the same time.
Each relationship should bereported as a separate object due to complications of cross reference that would arise if the valencies inthe BNF were larger than one fill per slot for the relations.6.
Granularity.Some organizations may be proper parts of a larger organization.
An employee can be reported inrelations to both the smaller and larger organizations, but, together with the rules for optionality, theEMPLOYEE_OF relation with the smaller organization will be optional.
For example, Andrew Blake isrelated to the Boston Globe in the preamble and it is stated in a sentence at the end of the article that he ison the Globe Staff.
He is technically an employee of both organizations.
However, the Globe Staff is anoptional organization because it is a part of the Boston Globe, so his relationship to the Globe Staff willessentially be optional.<ENTITY-9601120741-11> :=ENT_NAME: "the Globe Staff"ENT_TYPE: ORGANIZATIONENT_CATEGORY: ORG_COOBJ_STATUS: OPTIONALCOMMENT: "optional because part of a larger organization"7.
Affiliations.A person's general affiliation with an organization is not enough to qualify as an EMPLOYEE_OFrelation.a.
club membershipFor example, a member of the Boy Scouts is not an employee, but a paid person on the staff of the BoyScouts of America is an employee.b.
committee membershipIf a committee member is paid for their work, it is usually by a different organization than the committee.For example, "a spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee" is an employee of the House ifthe House appears in the text separately and not an employee of the committee under any conditions.Technically the Democratic National Committee probably does have employees, but for our purposes, weassume that committees never pay their members for serving on the committee.c.
team membershipTeam members are only considered employees of the team if they are paid by the team.
So members ofteams in the NBA, NFL, and NHL are in an EMPLOYEE_OF relationship with their teams, but themembers of the U.S. men's gymnastics team are not.8.
Ownership.An owner of an organization is generally not considered an employee.
It is true that an owner does workand does potentially receive financial benefits, but there is no direct relationship between those benefitsand the owner's efforts.
However, if the owner also has a paid position in the company, for example,CFO, then they are an employee.
So "a founder and CEO of Valujet" would be considered an employee.10.2.4 LOCATION_OF ObjectDEFINITION:A relationship between a LOCATION and an ORGANIZATION.
The location of an organization is aspecification of its position or limits.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:Both the ORGANIZATION and LOCATION must appear in the text and be filled as template elements.
Forthe relationship to be filled the organization must be at the location.
The relation points to these objects.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
Existence dependencies.Entities may be created or cease to exist during the time covered in the article.
These changes may havean effect on the instantiation of a relationship.2.
Time dependencies.Only the current relationship is to be reported.
Current time can be either the time of the article or thetime of the story being told within the article depending on the style.3.
Implication by form.A relationship can be inferred from the format of the article.
For example, the following beginningparagraph causes an optional LOCATION_OF relation to be instantiated for Navy.WASHINGTON &MD; The squadron commander of the F-14 pilot in the Nashville crash that killed fivepeople last week has been relieved of his command, the Navy announced Sunday.<ENTITY-9602040136-1> :=ENT_NAME: "NAVY"ENT_TYPE: ORGANIZATIONENT_CATEGORY: ORG_GOVT<LOCATION-9602040136-1> :=LOCALE: "WASHINGTON"LOCALE_TYPE: CITYCOUNTRY: "United States"<LOCATION_OF-9602040136-1> :=LOCATION: <LOCATION-9602040136-1>ORGANIZATION: <ENTITY-9602040136-1>OBJ_STATUS: OPTIONALCOMMENT: "implied"However, it cannot be assumed that all organizations in the text are located in Washington.
The openingaction does seem to take place in the location where the report originates.4.
Inference versus world knowledge.The extracted information must be locatable or linked to something in the text.
The use of worldknowledge in inferencing from information contained in the text is expected during informationextraction, but information outside of the text should not be entered in the fills.
For example, thePentagon should not always be instantiated as being in Washington just because its location is known tothe system.5.
Valencies.Some organizations may have multiple locations, such as the Navy or a large or multi-national company.Each of these LOCATION_OF relations is to be instantiated separately.6.
Granularity.Some locations may be proper parts of larger reported locations.
In these cases, the most specific locationfor an organization is the only one that should be instantiated.10.3 Scoring NoteIf a Template Relation in the key points to any optional Template Element, that relationship is automaticallymade optional by the scorer to limit annotator error.APPENDIX B.
Example of Template Relation ObjectsThese are examples of fills for the Template Relation task that are extracted from a text in the MUC-5 corpus.The extracted information and the text itself appear below.

The former is listed as type PORT and the latter is listed both astype CITY and type PROVINCE.
Since PORT is collapsed with CITY as far as the IE task is concerned, thatleaves two alternative correct answers in the answer key.

Times News Service</PREAMBLE><TEXT> <p>WASHINGTON &MD; The squadron commander of the F-14 pilot in the Nashville crash that killed fivepeople last week has been relieved of his command, the Navy announced Sunday.
<p>Citing three accidents over the last year, the Navy decided to reassign the commander, Fred Kilian, because of``a loss of trust and confidence'' in his ability to lead the squadron, said a spokesman, Comdr.
Gregg Hartung.<p>Fighter Squadron 213, a 14-plane unit based in Miramar Naval Base near San Diego, had developed by far theworst safety record among the Navy's 13 F- 14 squadrons, with four crashes over the last 16 months, three afterKilian became its leader.
<p>A Navy officer said that Kilian had an ``excellent reputation.
"<p>``But in the Navy,'' the officer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, ``we hold people accountable forthings that happen during the time of their command.
In this particular case, this particular squadron has anexceptionally high accident rate &MD; higher than any other.''
<p>The officer said the decision to reassign Kilian to the Pacific headquarters of the Navy's Fighter Wing wasmade Saturday by the commander of Carrier Air Wing 11, Capt.
Dennis Gillespie.
<p>Kilian could not be reached for comment.
<p>In the latest crash, an F-14 from Squadron 213 plunged to the ground immediately after takeoff on Jan. 29,killing the pilot, Lt. Comdr.
John Stacy Bates, the jet's radar operator Lt. Graham Alden Higgins, and threecivilians in a house the plane crashed into.
<p>Bates had crashed an F-14 into the Pacific during a routine training flight in April.
Navy officials blamed himfor causing the accident, in which no one was hurt, by losing control, but forgave him because they felt he wasdisplaying the sort of aggressive flying style the Navy encourages.

Scenario Template Task Object DefinitionThis scenario concerns air vehicle launch reports and updates.The template captures information about thelaunch vehicle, the payload of that vehicle, the date and site of the launch, and information about the missiontype, function and status.
The event object captures vehicle information, payload information, the date andlocation of the launch, and mission information.
The relational and low-level objects capture vehicleinformation, including vehicle type, owner and manufacture information, payload information, includinginformation about payload type and function, owner, manufacturer, origin, target, and recipient.
A relevantarticle refers to a vehicle launch that is scheduled, in progress or has actually occurred and must minimallyidentify the payload, the date of the launch, whether the launch is civilian or military, the function of themission and its status.
The date of the launch should be specified directly or can be inferred from information inthe article.11.1 Template BNF<TEMPLATE> :=DOC_NR: "NUMBER" ^CONTENT: <LAUNCH_EVENT> *COMMENT: "COMMENT"<LAUNCH_EVENT> :=VEHICLE_INFO: <VEHICLE_INFO>PAYLOAD_INFO: <PAYLOAD_INFO> +LAUNCH_DATE: <TIME> ^LAUNCH_SITE: <LOCATION>MISSION_TYPE: { MILITARY, CIVILIAN } ^MISSION_FUNCTION: { TEST, DEPLOY, RETRIEVE } +MISSION_STATUS: { SUCCEEDED, FAILED, IN_PROGRESS, SCHEDULED } ^COMMENT: "COMMENT"<VEHICLE_INFO> :=VEHICLE: <ENTITY>VEHICLE_TYPE: { SHUTTLE, ROCKET, GROUND_BASED, AIRPLANE, SHIP, SUBMARINE } ^VEHICLE_OWNER: <ENTITY>VEHICLE_MAN: <ENTITY>COMMENT: "COMMENT"<PAYLOAD_INFO> :=PAYLOAD: <ENTITY>PAYLOAD_IDENTIFIER: "TEXT"PAYLOAD_TYPE: { SATELLITE, MISSILE, SPACE_PROBE, MATERIAL, PERSONNEL, OTHER } ^PAYLOAD_FUNC: { COMMS, INTELL, WEATHER, TV, DESTRUCTION, RESEARCH, UNK } ^PAYLOAD_OWNER: <ENTITY>PAYLOAD_MAN: <ENTITY>PAYLOAD_ORIGIN: <LOCATION>PAYLOAD_TARGET: <LOCATION>PAYLOAD_RECIP: <ENTITY> *COMMENT: "COMMENT"<ENTITY> :=ENT_NAME: "NAME" *ENT_TYPE: { ORGANIZATION, PERSON, ARTIFACT } ^ENT_DESCRIPTOR: "DESCRIPTOR"ENT_CATEGORY: { ORG_GOVT, ORG_CO, ORG_OTHER, PER_MIL, PER_CIV, PER_OTHER,ART_AIR, ART_GROUND, ART_WATER } ^OBJ_STATUS: { OPTIONAL }COMMENT: "TEXT"<LOCATION> :=LOCALE: "LOCALE" +LOCALE_TYPE: { CITY, PROVINCE, COUNTRY, REGION, WATER, AIRPORT, UNK } ^COUNTRY: "`yourpath/countries_regions'"OBJ_STATUS: { OPTIONAL }COMMENT: "TEXT"<TIME> :=START: [TEXT]END: [TEXT]DESCRIPTOR: "DESCRIPTOR" ^OBJ_STATUS: { OPTIONAL }COMMENT: "COMMENT"%%DATE-EXP :: [[01-31]][[01-12]][[1000-9999]YYYY]| {FA, WI, SP, SU, 1Q, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q, 1F, 2F, 3F, 4F, FY}[[1000-9999]YYYY]| {FA, WI, SP, SU, 1Q, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q,1F, 2F, 3F, 4F, FY}[[1000-9999]YYYY]| [[01-12]][[1000-9999]YYYY]| [[1000-9999]]| UNCLEAR11.2 Fill RulesNote that each object defined by the template BNF contains COMMENT and OBJ_STATUS slots.
These slotsare reserved for use in the answer-key templates; they are not to be generated by the extraction systems.
SeeInformation Extraction Task Definition document for further information.11.2.1 TEMPLATE ObjectDEFINITION:Top-level object.
See Information Extraction Task Definition for further information.11.2.1.1 DOC_NR SlotDEFINITION:Document identifier.
See Information Extraction Task Definition for further information.11.2.1.2 CONTENT SlotDEFINITION:Pointer to object that captures info on the mission launch event.
See Information Extraction Task Definition forgeneral information.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:The article must identify, imply, or refer to a vehicle launch, must identify the payload of the vehicle, thelaunch date, and the mission type, function and status.
To be relevant, it must be the case that either the launchevent has actually occurred, and that a date can be specified or inferred for it, or that a launch is beingscheduled and that a date for the scheduled launch is specified directly or can be inferred from the article or thata mission resulting from a launch event is in progress.
The actual launch vehicle itself need not be identifiednor information about it provided.
More than one launch event may be mentioned in an article.
If there aremultiple events instantiated, additional events must meet the same minimum instantiation conditions.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
Relevant types of launches are limited to those that have actually occurred or those that are scheduled,with a specific date (at least year) either given or inferable for the launch.
Hypothetical discussions of alaunch ("what if...") are not relevant.2.
More than one launch event may be mentioned in an article.
For a second launch event to be relevant, itmust be related in mission, payload, or vehicle information to the first relevant launch event.3.
There must be one fully instantiated LAUNCH_EVENT object for the article to be relevant.
AdditionalLAUNCH_EVENT objects must meet the same minimum instantiation conditions.11.2.2 LAUNCH_EVENT Object.DEFINITION:The vehicle launch event.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:See section 11.2.1. above.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
Instantiate separate LAUNCH_EVENTS for each launch, subject to instantiation conditions.2.
Instantiate separate LAUNCH_EVENT objects for each launch a vehicle may participate in.
A vehiclemay be involved in more than one LAUNCH_EVENT (e.g.
several launches of the same shuttle vehicle,like the Endeavor).3.
In some articles, mention of a launch event may not meet minimum instantiation conditions, e.g.
anarticle discussing the deployment of Sputnik might not provide date information since that information ispart of the general knowledge of the reader, or an article discussing satellite sales might mention severalfuture satellite launches, but not provide any date information since that is not the focus of the article.
Forthe sake of consistency, there will be no LAUNCH_EVENT object generated for such launches.11.2.2.1 VEHICLE_INFO SlotDEFINITION:Pointer to object carrying information about vehicle type, vehicle, owner, and manufacturer of the vehicle.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot may be empty.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
If the payload is a missile and no other launch vehicle is specified, then instantiate a VEHICLE_INFO withthe missile as the VEHICLE and VEHICLE_TYPE as ROCKET.11.2.2.2 PAYLOAD_INFO SlotDEFINITION:Pointer to object carrying information about the payload, payload type, function, owner, manufacturer, origin,target, and recipient involved in the launch.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:The text must supply a fill for at least one of the following slots: PAYLOAD or PAYLOAD_IDENTIFIER.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
Instantiate one PAYLOAD_INFO for each payload in a given LAUNCH_EVENT, subject toinstantiation conditions.
Several PAYLOAD_INFOs may be instantiated for a given LAUNCH_EVENT,since a launch vehicle may carry several payloads, cf.
space shuttle articles.2.
If the launch vehicle carries another vehicle as payload, then any cargo carried on board the non-launchvehicle should not be considered payload and a PAYLOAD_INFO slot will not be instantiated.
Forexample, if the space shuttle carries and deploys a satellite and that satellite carries a tether or aninflatable antenna, which will itself be deployed, do not instantiate a PAYLOAD_INFO slot for the tetheror antenna.3.
PAYLOAD_INFO will not be instantiated for payload that is not retrieved to, deployed from, or testedoutside of the launch vehicle.
For example, PAYLOAD_INFO will not be instantiated for test equipmentresting inside, and remaining inside, the shuttle's cargo bay.11.2.2.3 LAUNCH_DATE slotDEFINITION:Pointer to an object indicating the date of the vehicle launch.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot must always be filled.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:See section 11.2.5 and time-guidelines-supplement-07aug97.1.
If two mentions of dates for the launch are given, the most specific date should be extracted.
Forexample, if the choice is between extracting "last week" or "January 17" as the date of the launch, choose"January 17".2.
For scheduled launches, if the launch is scheduled for later in the current day and no specific mention ismade in the article of the launch date, the default LAUNCH_DATE will be the date of the article.Otherwise the future date of the scheduled launch must be specified in the article or must be inferablefrom information in the article (see notes 3-5 below).3.
For articles about the space shuttle, if both the date of the shuttle's launch and the dates of the payload'sdeployment(s) are given, use the date of the shuttle launch as the LAUNCH_DATE.4.
For articles about the space shuttle, if no LAUNCH_DATE for the shuttle is given or inferable, butdeployment dates for individual payloads are given (this usually happens when the missions are inprogress), use the earliest deployment date as the LAUNCH_DATE.5.
Similarly, for articles not about the shuttle, if there is no mention of a LAUNCH_DATE, but adeployment date is given (i.e.
vehicle information is not provided, but payload information is), theLAUNCH_DATE is the same as the earliest deployment date.
For example, this would mean that arocket launch and deployment of a satellite from that rocket occur on the same day.11.2.2.4 LAUNCH_SITE SlotDEFINITION:Pointer to an object indicating the location of the launchMINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot may be empty.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
The most specific location information should be used.
For example, in "the rocket was launched fromXichang in the Sichuan Province in southwestern China", then LAUNCH_SITE will be a pointer to theLOCATION object for "Xichang.
"11.2.2.5 MISSION_TYPE SlotDEFINITION:A general categorization of the type of mission being performed.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot must always be filled.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
The categories that are to be used for this slot are defined as follows:MILITARY -- A launch of a military payload.CIVILIAN -- A launch of a civilian payload.2.
If no specific mention of a military mission is given, the default is CIVILIAN.
For example, thedeployment of Sputnik would be of MISSION_TYPE CIVILIAN if no mention of military mission isprovided in the article.3.
The selection of the MISSION_TYPE is dependent on the payload being launched.
For example, if amilitary intelligence satellite is being launched from a civilian vehicle (e.g.
the space shuttle), theMISSION_TYPE is MILITARY.4.
If more than one payload is being launched from the same vehicle (e.g.
a space shuttle), then militarypayload will take precedence and determine the MISSION_TYPE.
For example, if both a commercialcommunications satellite and a military intelligence satellite are being launched, the MISSION_TYPEwill be MILITARY, even though one or more of the payloads is civilian.5.
Civilian government organizations, such as NASA, are considered CIVILIAN.11.2.2.6 MISSION_FUNCTION SlotDEFINITION:A categorization of the mission of the launch with respect to the payload.
Multiple MISSION_FUNCTIONSmay be specified.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot must be filled.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
The categories that are to be used for this slot are defined as follows:TEST -- The mission is to TEST the payload.DEPLOY -- The mission is to DEPLOY the payload.RETRIEVE.-- The mission is to RETRIEVE the payload2.
More than one MISSION_FUNCTION category may be selected.
For example, if on a single mission,from a single launch vehicle, one satellite is being deployed and a different satellite is being retrieved,both DEPLOY and RETRIEVE will be selected.3.
If a payload is deployed, tested, and then retrieved on the same mission, then the MISSION_FUNCTIONassociated with that payload will be TEST.4.
The default value of MISSION_FUNCTION is DEPLOY, if no other MISSION_FUNCTION isspecified or inferred from information in the article.11.2.2.7 MISSION_STATUS SlotDEFINITION:A categorization of the status of the mission with respect to its success.
Only one may be selected.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot must be filled.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
The categories that are to be used for this slot are defined as follows:SUCCEEDED -- The mission function has been fulfilled.FAILED -- The mission function has not been fulfilled.IN_PROGRESS -- The mission function has not yet been completed.SCHEDULED -- The mission has not yet occurred and has been scheduled.2.
All mission functions must be successful for SUCCEEDED to be specified.
For example, if a missionincludes the deployment of several payloads, then all payloads must have been successfully deployed forthe MISSION_STATUS to be SUCCEEDED.3.
For MISSION_STATUS to be FAILED, at least one of the mission functions associated with itspayloads must have failed.
For example, if a shuttle mission involves two satellite deployments and onehas failed while the other has succeeded, then the category selected is FAILED.
In another example, ifthe mission involves testing a satellite by first deploying it and then retrieving it, if one of the actions hasfailed, e.g.
the retrieval failed, then the mission is not successful and the fill is FAILED.4.
For MISSION_STATUS to be IN_PROGRESS, the launch must have already occurred, but aMISSION_FUNCTION related to a particular payload is not complete, e.g.
the satellite being tested hasbeen deployed, but not yet retrieved.
This category is only appropriate for shuttle missions and spacestation missions.5.
For MISSION_STATUS to be SCHEDULED, a future date for the launch must be specified or inferred.6.
If the mission is only partially successful at its conclusion, e.g.
"completed 70% of its objectives", thenMISSION_STATUS is FAILED.7.
If the launch involves missiles, assume the MISSION_STATUS is SUCCEEDED, unless otherwisenoted, i.e.
the missile has hit its target.8.
If a mission has not yet been completed, and one portion of the mission has not been successful, mark theMISSION_STATUS as FAILED.11.2.3 VEHICLE_INFO ObjectDEFINITION:This object relates information about the launch vehicle.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:See section 11.2.2.1.11.2.3.1 VEHICLE SlotDEFINITION:Pointer to the object that identifies and names the vehicle involved in the launch event.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot must be filled.
The name of a vehicle or a descriptor must be given.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
Text must directly identify the vehicle model or series or else the vehicle must be identified by a substantialdescriptor, as defined in the Information Extraction Task Definition.
For example, a vehicle model or serieswould be things like J-802 or Long March or Saturn.11.2.3.2 VEHICLE_TYPE SlotDEFINITION:A categorization of the type of launch vehicle.
Only one may be selected.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot must be filled.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
The categories that are to be used for this slot are defined as follows:SHUTTLE -- The space shuttle.ROCKET -- A rocket.GROUND_BASED -- Vehicle is launched from the ground.
Used for some kinds of missiles.AIRPLANE -- A commercial, private, or military aircraft.SHIP -- A vehicle that rides on the surface of water.SUBMARINE -- An underwater vehicle.2.
If the article is about the launch of a space shuttle and its payload and no specific mention of the rocketused to launch the space shuttle is made, consider the shuttle to be the launch vehicle.
If mention is madeof a particular rocket carrying a shuttle, then specify the launch vehicle as the rocket and not the shuttle.For example, in "NASA is proceeding with its plans to launch the shuttle Endeavor on a mission toretrieve a Japanese science satellite," the VEHICLE_TYPE is SHUTTLE.
In "Hyflex, Japan's spaceshuttle prototype, will shoot up through the atmosphere on its Japanese-made J1 booster rocket," theVEHICLE_TYPE is ROCKET [and the VEHICLE is the J1].11.2.3.3 VEHICLE_OWNER SlotDEFINITION:Pointer to the object that identifies the owner of the vehicle.
This will either be an ENTITY of typeORGANIZATION or of type PERSON.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot must be filled.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
VEHICLE_OWNER will be filled by a pointer to an ENTITY of type ORGANIZATION or PERSON.2.
When VEHICLE_OWNER is filled by a pointer to an ENTITY object of type ORGANIZATION.
Theorganization can be a private company, a branch of the military (such as the "Navy"), or a civiliangovernment organization (such as "NASA").3.
VEHICLE_OWNER may be instantiated by a launch service operator or a launch agent, e.g.
Great Wall.11.2.3.4 VEHICLE_MAN SlotDEFINITION:Identification of the company that manufactured the launch vehicle.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot may be empty.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
The name or description of the manufacturing organization must be given.2.
Relevant types of organizations for the MANUFACTURER slot are limited to those that are categorizedas ENT_TYPE ORGANIZATION where ENT_CATEGORY is ORG_CO.3.
If the vehicle is military, the manufacturer must be identified independently of the military in order forthis slot to be filled.11.2.4 PAYLOAD_INFO ObjectDEFINITION:This object relates information about the payload for the launch.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:See section 11.2.2.2 above.11.2.4.1 PAYLOAD SlotDEFINITION:Pointer to the object that identifies and names the payload being carried by the launch vehicle.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot must be filled.
The name of an entity or a descriptor must be given.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
Text must directly identify the name of the payload (if the payload is human) or the payload model orseries, or else a substantial descriptor must be provided.2.
If a launch vehicle itself is being tested, and the vehicle is either not carrying a specific payload or iscarrying no payload, then the PAYLOAD is the same as the VEHICLE, i.e.
the vehicle itself is thepayload during a test of the launch vehicle.
For example, if an Ariane 5 rocket is launched as a testvehicle, then both the PAYLOAD and the VEHICLE will be instantiated with Ariane 5.3.
Personnel are not considered PAYLOAD if they are deploying, retrieving, or testing payloads, likesatellites.
So, if a person conducts a space walk while deploying a satellite, he/she is not considered thePAYLOAD.11.2.4.2 PAYLOAD_IDENTIFIER SlotDEFINITION:Noun phrase identifying or referring to a payload that is not of type vehicle or person.
This slot is not permittedto have more than one value.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:Text must provide a string that identifies a payload and that does not fit the definition of PAYLOAD slot.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
This is intended to capture information on cargo that is being deployed, retrieved or tested outside the launchvehicle.
A payload that is being tested or merely rests within the launch vehicle, e.g.
within the Shuttle cargobay, will not qualify as a PAYLOAD_IDENTIFIER.11.2.4.3 PAYLOAD_TYPE SlotDEFINITION:A categorization of the type of payload being carried by the launch vehicle.
One must be selected.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot must be filled.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
The categories that are to be used for this slot are defined as follows:SATELLITE -- A satellite.MISSILE -- A missile, land-, sea-, or air-launched.SPACE_PROBE -- A space probe.MATERIAL -- Supplies or equipment.PERSONNEL -- A person.OTHER -- Some payload other than those specified above.1.
Only one item may be selected from PAYLOAD_TYPE.2.
PAYLOAD_TYPE will be PERSONNEL if a specific person is being deployed to or retrieved from anothervehicle or location (e.g.
transferred to space station MIR, landing on the moon) or if the person will participateas a subject in an experiment.
If no mention is made of any of these kinds activities, then personnel will not beconsidered as PAYLOAD and a PAYLOAD_TYPE will not be instantiated.11.2.4.4 PAYLOAD_FUNC SlotDEFINITION:A categorization of the function or use of payload being carried by the launch vehicle.
One or more must beselected.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot must be filled.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
The categories that are to be used for this slot are defined as follows:COMMS -- payload is for transmitting or receiving communications, such as cellular telephone traffic, e.g.communications satelliteINTELL -- payload receives or transmits intelligence information, e.g.
intelligence satelliteWEATHER -- payload receives or transmits weather information, e.g.
weather satelliteTV -- payload transmits or receives TV signals, e.g.
digital TV satelliteDESTRUCTION -- payload is used for destructive purposes, e.g.
missiles.RESEARCH -- payload is being used to conduct research, e.g.
satellite collecting info in cosmic rays or a spaceprobe being sent off for journey to Mars.UNK -- function of payload is unknown from information in the article.11.2.4.5 PAYLOAD_OWNER SlotDEFINITION:Pointer to the object that identifies the owner of the payload.
This will either be an ENTITY of typeORGANIZATION or of type PERSON.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot may be empty.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
For CIVILIAN payload, the PAYLOAD_OWNER will be filled by a pointer to an ENTITY of typeORGANIZATION or PERSON.
Note that civilian government organizations like NASA are consideredCIVILIAN for this task.2.
For MILITARY payload, PAYLOAD_OWNER will be filled by a pointer to an ENTITY object of typeORGANIZATION, with the category ORG_GOVT.
This includes, for example, a branch of the military(such as the "Navy").3.
If the payload is of PAYLOAD_TYPE PERSONNEL, the PAYLOAD_OWNER slot will be instantiatedwith the employer of that person.
For example, if Shannon Lucid is the payload, then thePAYLOAD_OWNER will be NASA.11.2.4.6 PAYLOAD_MAN SlotDEFINITION:Identification of the company that manufactured the payload.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot may be empty.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
The name or description of the manufacturing organization must be given.2.
Relevant types of organizations for the MANUFACTURER slot are limited to those that are categorizedas ENT_TYPE ORGANIZATION where ENT_CATEGORY is ORG_CO.3.
If the payload is military, the manufacturer must be identified independently of the military in order forthis slot to be filled.11.2.4.7 PAYLOAD_ORIGIN SlotDEFINITION:Pointer to an object indicating the location of payload's manufacturer or owner.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot may be empty.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
The most specific location information should be used.
For example, if the article contains informationabout a satellite manufactured in Italy by Manufa and also contains information that Manufa is in Milan,then use Milan as the PAYLOAD_ORIGIN.2.
If no specific manufacturer or owner location information is available, but location information can beextracted, e.g.
in "Italian satellite", fill the PAYLOAD_ORIGIN with the location, e.g.
"Italy".3.
If location information about both the manufacturer and owner are available, use the location of theowner.11.2.4.8 PAYLOAD_TARGET SlotDEFINITION:Identification of the target location or destination for the payload.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot may be empty.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
This slot is filled by a pointer to a LOCATION object.2.
If the PAYLOAD_TYPE is a MISSILE, then the PAYLOAD_TARGET is an earth-based LOCATION, suchas a city, nation, or region.
If the PAYLOAD_TYPE is a SPACE_PROBE, then the PAYLOAD_TARGET isspace-based, such as a planet, or asteroid.3.
If the payload has several destinations scheduled (e.g.
a space probe might have several intermediarydestinations and then a final destination), then only the final destination should be extracted.11.2.4.9 PAYLOAD_RECIP SlotDEFINITION:Identification of the recipient(s) of the services of the payload.
This slot may have more than one fill.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:This slot may be empty.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:1.
PAYLOAD_RECIP is a pointer to an ENTITY object.
There may be pointers to more than one ENTITY.2.
The name or description of the recipient must be given.3.
The recipient can be a pointer to an ORGANIZATION.
For example, in "News Corp. leased space on theIntelsat satellite," the PAYLOAD_RECIP is "News Corp." If several organizations are specified as leasingspace, all will be identified in the PAYLOAD_RECIP slot.
However, if the organizations have joined in aconsortium and that consortium is named, then the consortium name will be extracted and the names of theindividual consortium members will not be identified.4.
The recipient can be a pointer to an ARTIFACT.
For example, in "one missile struck the frigate Stark", theENTITY filled by "the frigate Stark" is the PAYLOAD_RECIP.
Another example is found in "the astronautwas transferred to the space station MIR," Here MIR would be the PAYLOAD_RECIP.5.
The recipient can be a pointer to a PERSON.
For example, Timothy Leary and Gene Rodenberry arePAYLOAD_RECIPs as they receive the services of the satellite that is launching their ashes into outer space.Similarly, an individual may be a PAYLOAD_RECIP is he or she is the object of a missile launch.6.
The payload owner will not be instantiated as a PAYLOAD_RECIP unless there is some other recipientas well.
In most cases, payload owner will not be instantiated as a payload recipient.11.2.5 TIME ObjectDEFINITION: An absolute or relative date expressed as a date range.MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS:"See "A Revised Template Description for Time (v3)" prepared by James Pustejovsky and Federica Busa.SPECIAL USAGE NOTES:These special usage notes supersede remarks in the time-guidelines-supplement-07aug97.1.
Interpretation of the template element may require calculation from the reference date of the article.
Forexample, "in the next 2 days" means that the START value is today, and the END value is today+2.2.
DESCRIPTOR is a required slot if there is a time expression.3.
Time of day information will not be extracted for MUC-7.
However, if two events occur at different timesduring the same day, e.g.
Saturday morning vs. Saturday evening, different TIME objects will be instantiated.If only a day of the week is specified for both events, e.g.
Saturday, then the one TIME object will beinstantiated.4.
Calendar information about days of the week will be recognized.
For example, last Saturday, if DD=8/8/97,would have the DATE-EXP = 02081997.5.
The START and END values represent the longest possible duration of the interval, e.g., START 290687starts just after midnight on the 29th and END 010787 ends at midnight on the 1st.
The times need not bespecified in the date expression.6.
Weeks will not be calculated.
It is usually unclear, what is meant by expressions like: next week, this week,last week, in two weeks, i.e.
whether the week is Sun-Sat or is based on the date of the article.
UNCLEAR willbe used as required.
For example, "this week" [where DD is "07/15/87"] would be expressed asTIME: START 15071987END: UNCLEARDESCRIPTOR: "this week"7.
UNCLEAR will be used if the START or END points are not specified fully or cannot be inferred from othertime information.
This will be used for such expressions as "before June 5, 1987", where the START point isUNCLEAR but the END point is "June 5, 1987."8.
Intermittent time expressions will be expressed by the most recent occurrence.
For example, "every January28th" only the most recent will be specified:TIME: START: 28011997END: 28011997If an intermittent time expression has more specific interval information, that will be used.
For example, ifthe time expression were "every January 28th for the last 10 years", the object would look like:TIME: START: 28011987END: 280119979.
For time expressions where specific start and end points are not given, for example "in April" or "duringJune," only the month and year need be given.TIME: START: 041997END: 04199710.
DESCRIPTOR will not include a preposition unless that preposition changes the semantics of the phrase.This is consistent with NE markup requirements.
For example, "since 1995" would be a DESCRIPTORbecause "1995" and "since 1995" have two different meanings.
Similarly "between Thursday and Saturday"would be a DESCRIPTOR.
For the prepositional phrase "on Tuesday," "Tuesday" would be theDESCRIPTOR.11.
Temporal modifiers (cf.
"A Revised Template Description for Time (v3)") have been removed from theTemplate BNF in section 11.1 above.
For TIME expressions that contain "early, mid, late", e.g.
early May,mid-April, late 1997, appropriate dates will be calculated.
Divide the time period (month, year) into three equalparts, the first third = early, the second third = mid, and the last third = late.
If there is an extra unit (month of31 days), tack the remainder onto the "late" range.
For example, for months the following would beappropriate:TIME: START: 01051997END: 10051997DESCRIPTOR: "early May 1997"TIME: START: 11051997END: 20051997DESCRIPTOR: "mid May 1997"TIME: START: 21051997END: 31051997DESCRIPTOR: "late May 1997"For years, the following would be appropriate:TIME: START: 011997END: 041997DESCRIPTOR: "early 1997"TIME: START: 051997END: 081997DESCRIPTOR: "mid 1997"TIME: START: 091997END: 121997DESCRIPTOR: "late 1997"Decades, centuries, etc.
should be handled similarly.For more website information contact: Ellen VoorheesFor more evaluation information contact: Nancy ChinchorLast updated: Tuesday, 08-Mar-05 15:20:06Date created: Friday, 12-Jan-01
