rd'uIll this paper, we present the theoretica.1 foun(la.tions which underlie our current research.
Weemphasize a methodologicaJ point: connections among proposed theories of discourse structure mustbe carefiflly explicated.
By making these connections, we ca.n (letermilm whether theories ma.keequiva.lent claims, consistent 1)ut unrelated cla.ims or differ iu substa.ntive issues.
A synthesis ofcurrent theories is required, a descriptive fl'a.mework which assumes the common ground and whichhighlights issues to be resolved.
Further, there a.re two distinct :lh.ctors to guide us ill developingsuch a synthesis.
First, the descriptive fl'a.mework nmst facilita.te the fi:)rmula.tion of controversi;dissues in terms of empirical predictions.
Then, the synthesis ca.n I)e developed a.nd refined bylinguistic studies.
Second, the fr~uuework must be a.pplicaJ)le to computer processing of na.turallanguage, both understa.nding and gener~tion.
Our particula.r interest is the computer generationof explanations in a. tutoring system.
Idea.lly, the fi'a.mework will provide a. me~ns through whichthe results of discourse a.nalysis and computatiorml linguistics ca.n inform one another.In its broadest outline, the goaJ is to uu(lersta.ad the precise i~H:era.ction between fea.tures oftbrm, meaning a.nd ffim(:tion ill the crea.tioll of discourse coherem:e. Wha.t kiuld o1' tbrm, mea.ning~tnt(i flmction links occur \])etween uttera.Jlces a.nd how a.re these thre~, ki,l(Is of links recognized?
Ina tirst step towards the synthesis we wouhl like to see, we will discuss the l~erspective which theG&S (Grosz and Sidner 1986) and RST (=RhetoricaJ Structure Theory, Ma.nn and Thompson 1988)theories take on links of meaning a.nd function.
We conclude with a brief description of a.n empiricaJstudy suggested by this theory compa.rison.
Note tha.t we consider only monologic discourse at thistime, believing genera.lizz~tions between this a.nd multi-agent discourse to be prema.ture.In the study and discussion of rhetorica.l relations, the terminology ha.s become nonsta,ndarda.nd confusing.
Here, we a.dol)t the term "discourse rela.tions" to mea.n all the conn(,ctions a.mongthe exl)ressions ill (liscourse which, ta.keu tog(,th(~r, a.ccount 1or its ('()\]lerence.
So, in order to bea.
(liscourse relation in the sense used here, two criteri,~ a.re requir(,(I.
One, the rebttion concernselements of a sentence utterance a.nd other utteraJtces in the context.
Two, the rel;Ltion must berecognized in order to understand the discourse, i.e., it contril)utes to coherence ra.ther than anotherconcern such as style.
As suggested above, SOlne fea.ture of form, mea.ning or fimction defines adiscourse relation.
These will be termed textual, informa.tiona.1 a.nd intentionaJ discourse relationsrespectively.
Informational a.nd intentional discourse rela.tions a.re essentia.lly non-linguistic in thesense that they do not originate with la.nguage.
Mffch recent work on discourse relations eitherexplicitly discusses or implictly uses a. distinction between in|brma.tionaJ and intentiona.1 relatious(Schiffrin 1987, Redeker 1990, Hovy and Ma.ier 1992, Moore a.nd Polla.ck 1992, Moser 1992, Sanders,Spooren and Noor(hnan 1992, inter aJia.).
The distinction, a. kind of sema.ntic-l)ragmatic d stinction,concerns the source of discourse rela,tions, whether ,~ rela.tion orgina,tes with what is being talkedabout (informationa.1) or with why we a.re taJking about it (intentionaJ).
Inibrma.tionzd iscourserelations arise bec,~use the meanings of exl~ressions in utt(.~ra.n('(-,s, the things 1)eing ta.lked about,stand in some relation ill tlle domain of discourse.
CAUSE, \['or exa.mple, is a.n iuforma.tiona.l rela.tionbecause it is a rela.tion between things tha.t a,r~, being ta.lked a.l)oul., tim fa('l, of on(~ situa,tion or94ew:nt causing another.
Intentional relations, ill coiltrast, concern how one spa ll is intellded t() affectthe bearer's mental att itude about another, i.e., why the speaker included some span of text.
Forexample, the EVIDENCE relation holds between two text spans if one is int(~ll(led to increase theheater's belief in the other.GaS  take a spea.ker's plan to be the source of discourse structur(~.
A general intention maydominate several subintentions which may theutselves be fiH'ther ,'~,lil,~,(I.
At the bottom of thehierarchicM structure are intentions which are rea,lize(I by 1)roduci,,g iltter;,.llC(~S ill the discourse,.Intentions higher in the intention structure are realized by the subintentions they dominate and,possibly, additional utterances which express the higher level intention.
Intentions are related I)ydominance, when one intention generates one or more sul)intentions, or by satisfa.ction-preceden(:e,when the realization of one intention is a. precondition ior the realization of a.llother, hi this theory,spans of text are related indirectly by the relatiolls I)etweell the intc~lll.iolls they rea.lize.In the original formulation of RST, the inibrmational-intentional (listillction wa.s noted (th(,recalled "subject matter"  and "l)resenta.tiona.1 '' relations), but wa.s not fully a,l)precia.ted.
Text ishierarchically structured and exa.ctly one R.ST relation is postulated 1)etwe('ll contiguous pans.Moore and Pollack (1992) 1)ropose that,  iH th.ct, two contiguous pans of text may be ill bothan informational and an intentional relation simultaneously and that recognition of one kind ofrelation can facilitate recognition of the other.
They note that inteHtiona.1 relations arise because"consecutive discourse elements are rela,te(I to one a.~lother 1)y mea.~s (~\[' tlm ways in which theyparticipate ill \[a spea.ker's\] plan."

In the original RST with only a single relation between Sl)ans, the direction of the rela.ti,~n(from satellite to nucleus) always represented the direct|oH of efiect, h, i l,troducing simultaneousintentional and informationa.1 relations, nucle;:l.rity is an a.spect of intenti(:)md rela.tiolls only.

For exa.mp\]e,a satellite span, S, may be intended to ;~.fli~ct a he~.rel"s I)elief in the ml(:le~s pa.n, N, (the EVIDENCErelation); or S may be intended to a.trect a. bearer's desire to perform th(, ~.

E relatio~ c;~,n occur onlywhe~ th(, d(~mina,ting intentio~is to affect another's belief.
Similarly, a.n R ST MOTIVATION rela.tion ('a.n occur only when thedominating intention is to affect a.nother's a.ctio~.
Thus the different kinds of intentional efl~ects inRST correspond to different kinds of dominating intentions ill G~S.
However, RST makes moredistinctions among kinds of effects thal~ G(~S, e.g., 1)oth EVIDENCE and  .IUSTIFICATION are ways ofaffecting beliefs and both MOTIVATION and ENABLEMENT are ways of a.ffecting actions.Now we turn to the status of intbrmational relations in the two the(~ri(:s, h~ R.ST, a singh'informational relation is assigned 1)etween sl)ans of text.
As a result, RST iHformational rela.ti(msconcern the sorts of entities denoted \])y entire spa~s, such as situ;~.l,it~ns and events.
If we ad(~ptthe view of Moore and Pollack, recognizing that inlbrmationa.1 ~l.tl(I intentional relati(~ns occursimultaneously, the informational relations are silH1)lified.
As noted a.bove, m~clearity, which wasan element of tile unique RST relation between spans N and S, is now a.n element of the intentiol~a/relation and is independent of the intbrm~.tional rela.tion.
Tha.t is, informatiom~.l relations no long~rconflate the sem~tntic link between situa.tio~s eXl)r(~sse(I I~y two sl)a.~s ;~n(I the domin~Lnce of Sl)~a.k~r95intentions realized by those spans.
In fact, without his conflation, it is unclear whether the semanticrelations hetween situations and events is in principle diffe.reut fl'om semantic links hetween otherkinds of entities.
Is the informational relation between two spans of text necessarily a relationhetween the entire spans?
Or, is it l~ossibh, that the infornmtiolml relation is a series of linksbetween wl.rious expressions contairmd in th(, Slm.lls?
Examl~les of 1.1,,se links I~etween smallerconstituents are would are coreference anl(I ;i. ca.usal ink I)etw(,(~J~ (,?l~r?,ssi?~Jls such as "l'Ul~ a redlight" and "the ticket.
"G&,S stresses that intentions of the speaker ar?~ the primary sour((, of (lis~'ours(~ structure.
Do-main knowledge plays a role in recognizing the intentional structure, but it is (Ioubtful whether anyspecial distinction wouhl be made betweezl khowle(Ige about events a.tkd sit.u~l.tions arid knowledgeabout other kinds of domain entities.In comparing the status of intentional a.lld intbrmation~d discourse rela.tiozLs in I)oth RST andG,~,S, at least two issues were specified whose resolution in currently pl'esume(l by I)oth theoriesin isolation.
First, what types of clominalw.e are distillguished by the theory- just dominance,dominance hy beliet:affecting intention versus dcuHina.uce by actiou-alli~ctittg intention, or the fullrange of RST intentional relations?
Second, do semantic links between whole spans of text playa role in the theory, or do semantic relations between all sorts of eud.ities have the same status?Both these questions can be answered sel)ar,a.tely del)ending on whether they are meant as a ques-tion ahont linguistic theory or ahout its al~l)lication to language processing.
Space prechtdes adiscussion of textual discourse relations as well as questions about how the three kinds of relationsinteract.
Further, proposals from linguists (Schiffriu 1987; R.e(leker I992) must be integrated intothe synthesis.We conchtde by sketching a discourse analysis tudy which begins to address the first questioncited above, one which we plan to do.
Using a broad range of text types, we select as tokens thepairs of spans that are related by lexical markers of discourse relatioHs uch as "so," "hecause" and"therefore."
For each token, we code the intbrmatioiml a.nd inteHti(:mal re\];i.tions that co-occur withit.
As emphasized by Moore and Paris (1992), there is not a, one-to-olLe nlapl)illg between intentionaland informational relations.
Though not COml)letely indel)en(lent, the i~ossibilities to1" intbrmationalrelations given the occurrence of a particul~.r intentional relatioxD ~l.t'e manhy, and vi('e versa.
Byinvestigating the range of combinations of informa.tional rid inteld:ioH;fi relations which occurwith a lexical marker, we cast identity the miHim;d descriptioll of the marker in terms of discourserelations.
That is, we can see whether a marker correlates highly with a l)articular discourse relationor combination of informational nd intentional relations.
Such a study will l)roduce results thatare uselqd for coinl)utational models of hoth llatul'al la.ngu~lg(, uzk(lersl.aL~dil~g az~d geHeration.
Ifa certain marker correlates highly with c(~rtai~l discourse relations, the u~dersta, n~der can formhypotheses about the discourse relations that are present whez~ it ellCOUld;ers a marker.
Similarly,if a generator must express two utterances connected hy a certain cotubin~a.tion f relations, it canuse the information about the correla,tion 1)etween markers and cond)inations of discourse relationsto dmose the most appropriate marker.In addition, this study will allow us to determine whether the distinction among types ofdominance plays a, role in accounting tbr the distribution of markers.
If the study confirms therelevance of this distinction, then (lomina~,:e types have a role t() play i~ a linguistic theory ofdiscourse coherence.
If the study does not ctmtirm the distinction, ;I.ct'ucial theoretical question iswhether there is any direct formal inguistic pattern other than these, markers that makes essentialuse of dominance types in its description.
Should fiH'ther research fail to identify such a pattern,then the status of donfinance types in linguistic theory in called in~t(~ question.
I\[owever, even if itturns out that dominance types are Hot forn~ally m~.rked by la.nguag(~, it remains a.l~ open questionwhether their application to computer generation an~d tm(lerstan(li~g will b(, useful.96References\[1\] Grosz, B., 1978.
