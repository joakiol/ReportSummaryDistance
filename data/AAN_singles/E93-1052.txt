Object clitics and clitic climbing in Italian HPSGPao la  Monaches i  *Tilburg University - CLS/ITKPostbus 90153, 5000 LE Tilburg, Nederlande-mail: paola@kub.nl1 IntroductionItalian object clitics can be involved in nonlocal de-pendencies in the sense that they must/may appearon a verbal head of which they are not an argument.Two cases where this situation arises will be dis-cussed: the first is due to the presence of an auxiliaryverb and the second is triggered by the presence of acertain class of verbs that allows clitic climbing.An analysis will be proposed within the frameworkof Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar \[Pollardand Sag, 1987; Pollard and Sag, 1993\]; it can beshown that an analysis in terms of nonlocal fea-tures and the Nonlocal Feature Principle, which isthe mechanism provided by HPSG to deal with non-local dependencies, does not provide a satisfactoryaccount of the phenomenon; it is too powerful.
Analternative approach will be proposed; it is based onthe idea that the arguments of a verb which is gov-erned by an auxiliary or clitic climbing trigger verbcan be raised to become arguments of the governorby a mechanism that achieves an effect similar tofunctional composition as developed within the tra-dition of Categorial Grammar.
This approach is ableto capture the right generalizations, to account forthe relevant data and can be easily extended to ac-count for long NP-movement which is another prop-erty of clitic climbing trigger verbs.2 Some l ingu is t i c  p roper t ies  o fI ta l ian  c l i t i csThere are arguments similar to the ones proposed by\[Miller, 1992a\] for French showing that Italian cliticsexhibit many properties that make them very simi-lar to inflectional affixes; the arguments are mainlybased on \[Zwicky and Pullum, 1983\].
The coordina-tion criteria proposed by \[Miller, 1992b\] can also beused to support this position.Italian clitics exhibit a high degree of selectionwith respect o their host; they can only attach toverbs.They present arbitrary gaps in their combination,since not all the combinations are allowed, behavingtherefore like affixes; in particular, it is not possi-ble to have a first or second person accusative clitictogether with a dative one.Italian clitics also exhibit morphophonological id-iosyncrasies: vowel deletion occurs when clitics likelo and la occur in front of a vowel initial stem.
Thisapplies also to ml,  tl, el, vi, li and si; but mainly in"Supported by a grant from the Center for LanguageStudies (CLS).grammarspoken language.
Certain changes also occur whenmore than one clitic is present, namely the final -iof a clitic is changed into -e if it is followed by an-other clitic which begins with 1- or n-.
Sequencing ofidentical clitics is not permitted in Italian, thereforecertain changes occur as in the combination of twosi or of two vi where one becomes ci.
Furthermore,if the third person dative feminine clitic le precedesa clitic beginning with l- or n-, the masculine dativeform gli is used instead of the feminine one.Other evidence for the affixal status of cliticscomes from coordination.
Italian clitics cannot havewide scope over coordination of verbs; the followingis not possible:(1) * Maria 1o comprera' e leggera'Maria cl.
(acc) will buy and will read'Maria will buy and read it'The clitic should be repeated in front of each verbbehaving like an affix according to the coordinationcriterium developed by \[Miller, 1992b\].Italian clitics are rigidly ordered in a fiat clitic clus-ter, adhering to the following ordering:(2) Clitics order in Italianmi < \[3 per.dat.\] < vi < ti < ci< si tell.
< \[3 per.ace\] < si imp.< neRigid ordering of elements has often been related tothe status of morphological ffix.The data presented above show evidence in favourof an analysis of Italian pronominal clitics as inflec-tional affixes; 1this will be the assumption underlyingboth of the analyses which will be presented in thefollowing sections.As already mentioned above, Italian clitics clusteraround the verb; they precede it if the verb is finiteand follow it if the verb is non-finite or an imperative.If there is an auxiliary, the clitic doesn't attach tothe verb that subcategorizes for it, but cliticizes tothe auxiliary as in:(3) Maria 1' ha mangiatoMaria cl.
(acc) has eaten'Maria has eaten it'1Italian clitics can appear both in proditic and in en-clitic position; it could be argued that this alternation isnot typical of affixes.
Data from Afar, Swazi and Ara-bic show that in these languages there are dual positionaffixes.437If in the main clause there is a restructuring verb\[Rizzi, 1982\], namely a verb which belongs to one ofthe following classes: modals ,  tempora l  aspectu-als, pure mot ion  verbs, the clitic can attach tothe main verb, but it can also attach to the verb inthe embedded sentence:(4) a. Maria lo vuole comprareMaria cl.
(acc) wants to buy'Maria wants to buy it'b.
Maria vuole comprarloMaria wants to buy cl.
(acc)'Maria wants to buy it'If there is more than one verb that belongs to one ofthe classes mentioned above, the clitic can attach tothe lower verb or climb to the middle position or allthe way up.Since clitic climbing is triggered by the restructur-ing verbs, the following will be ungrammatical be-cause the main verb does not belong to this class:(5) * Maria lo decide di leggereMaria cl.
(acc) decides to read'Maria decides to read it'As for their distribution, Italian clitics are in com-plementary distribution with full phrases as comple-ments of a lexicM head; so a sentence like the follow-ing will not be grammatical: 2(6) * Maria 1o da' il libro a GiovanniMaria cl.
(acc) gives the book to Giovanni'Maria it gives the book to Giovanni'3 A t reatment  in  te rms o f  non loca lfeaturesAs was shown by the examples in the previous ec-tion, in certain cases a clitic corresponding to thecomplement of a head is not present on that head,but on a higher node: clitics can thus be involved innonlocal dependencies.
HPSG has a syntactic mech-anism to account for Unbounded Dependency Con-structions, namely the Nonlocal  Feature  Pr inci -ple and the use of NONLOCAL features, which areanalogous to the Foot Feature  Pr inc ip le  and tothe FOOT features used in GPSG \[Gazdar et al,1985\].
Therefore it seems a reasonable choice to usethe same mechanism to handle cases ofnonlocal de-pendencies involving clitics.
3As discussed above, Italian pronominal clitics arein complementary distribution with full phrases as2If the full phrase is left (or right) dislocated, its cooc-currence with a clitic pronoun is possible.
See \[Sanfilippo,1990\] for an analysis of this type of constructions withinthe Unification Categorial Grammar framework.3See \[Monachesi, 1992\] for a more detailed escriptionof the analysis and \[Miller, 1992a\] for a similar analysis ofrelated facts in French within a GPSG/HPSG framework.complements of a lexical head; they must thereforefulfill the subcategorization requirements of the headof which they are a semantic argument.
Further-more, the information that the clitic will appear atsome point in the tree must be encoded if a verb thattriggers clitic climbing is present.A lexical rule can be used for this purpose; 4 itwill operate on the subcategorization list, removingthe slot related to the relevant full complement andadding a nonlocal feature OC (object clitic) whichencodes case and agreement information of the clitic.Since this is a nonlocal feature, its value can perco-late up the tree according to the Nonlocal  FeaturePr inc ip le  \[Pollard and Sag, 1993\]:(7) Nonlocal Feature PrincipleFor each nonlocal feature, the INHERITEDvalue on the mother is the union of the IN-HERITED values on the daughters minus theTO-BIND value on the head daughter.A TO-BINDIOC feature is assigned to the cliticizedverb form and will have as its value the agreementand case information relative to the clitic.
If there isidentity of values between the TO-BINDIOC featureand the INHER\]OC feature the percolation of thelatter will be stopped and the dependency will bebound off.
Therefore, for a sentence like (4a), thefollowing representation will be produced:(8) Example of derivationVP \ [ T O ~ O C { } \ ]V \[TO-BINDIOC {\[11}1 VP\[INHIOC {\[11}1 t ' V\[INHI~C 1\[1\]}\]lo vo le  comprareThis treatment can account for the following cases:?
cases with an auxiliary: the clitic must  climbin order to attach to it;?
cases with a verb that allows clitic climbing: theclitic may climb to attach to it.However, the mechanism as it has been sketchedso far will overgenerate allowing clitic climbing alsowith verbs that do not trigger it; a sentence like (5)will be accepted.
It is necessary to add specific local-ity constraints on the path of the OC feature in order4In the framework developed in Chapter 9 of \[Pollardand Sag, 1993\], lexical rules are also used in the treatmentof Unbounded Dependency Constructions to produce ananalysis that doesn't make use of empty categories.438to make the right predictions, namely the percolatio nof the feature must be stopped if there is a verb thatdoesn't rigger clitic climbing and must he allowed ifthere is a verb that triggers clitic climbing.
It seemstherefore that this approach doesn't naturally cap-ture the fact that clitic climbing is triggered only bya specific class of verbs since constraints need to beimposed to obtain this result.
This fact can be easilycaptured by an approach in terms of functional com-position which will be described in the next section.4 A functional composition approachto clitic climbingThe idea that underlies the approach was originallypresented by \[Hinrichs and Nakazawa, 1990\] for thetreatment of the German verb cluster.
They arguethat the arguments of a verb which is governed by anauxiliary can be raised to become arguments of theauxiliary.
They achieve this by making crucial useof the notion of structure sharing which is character-istic of unification-based formalisms uch as HPSG.The effect is similar to functional composition as de-veloped within Categorial Grammar.This approach can he extended to clitics in orderto account for the clitic climbing cases producing ananalysis which captures intuitions imilar to the onesunderlying a restructuring analysis \[Rizzi, 1982\] anda clause reduction one \[Aissen and Perlmutter, 1983\].In this case, the arguments of a verb which is gov-erned by an auxiliary or clitic climbing trigger can beraised to become arguments of the governor.
It willhe shown that the approach can handle the relevantdata concerning clitic climbing adequately and thatit can account naturally for the fact that only certainverbs can trigger clitic climbing.
Furthermore, it caneasily be extended to account for another propertyof restructuring verbs, namely the possibility of al-lowing for long NP-movement as in \[Rizzi, 1982\].4.1 The  analysisThe analysis is based on the assumption, previouslymotivated, that Italian clitics behave in a way simi-lar to inflectional affixes.
This implies that the verbforms a unit with the clitic and such combinationshould be accounted for in the morphological mod-ule.
An account in terms of template morphology asin \[Simpson and Withgott, 1986\] could handle therigid ordering of the clities and the restrictions incombination.As discussed above, clitics and full complementsare in complementary distribution in Italian: theclitic should fill the relevant slot in the subcatego-rization requirements sothat no full complement canoccur.
On the assumption that clitics behave likeinflectional affixes and not as syntactically indepen-dent elements, it is necessary to have a way to removethe subcategorization slot related to the full comple-ment if a clitic is present.
The Valence princi-pie, which is the principle of the grammar espon-sible for checking off subcategorization requirementsthat have been satisfied, cannot be used in this casesince the clitic doesn't have the status of a syntac-tic element.
5 A lexical rule (LRCL1)  can be usedinstead; namely given a verb that subcategorizes fora certain argument, the argument is removed fromthe subcategorization list but the equivalent cliticmust be present, attached to the verb as proposedby \[Miller and Sag, 1993\] for French.
The lexical ruletriggers the presence of the clitic as verb inflectionand acts as an interface to morphology.
It shouldlook roughly as follows:(9) Input oflexical rule (LRCL1)HEAD V \]COMPS( .... X .... )CLTS W(10) Output of lexical rule (LRCL1)HEAD V \]COMPS( ... )CLTS W U {X}Therefore, when the clitic attaches to the verb thatsubcategorizes for it, it cliticizes on the host in themorphological component and the relevant slot is re-moved from the subcategorization list by means ofthe lexical rule.When clitics are involved in nonloeal dependen-cies, namely when the clitic attaches to a head whichdoesn't subcategorize for it, the argument raisingcomes into play in addition to LRCL1.This analysis will look at two cases where this sit-uation arises: the case where an auxiliary verb ispresent and the case where a restructuring verb ispresent.In this treatment, auxiliaries and verbs that triggerclitic climbing subcategorize for a non-finite VP com-plement and for the complements of the VP; the con-struction of a partial VP must therefore he allowed.
6SThe analysis is carried out within the framework ofChapter 9 of \[Pollard and Sag, 1993\] which incorporatesinnovations due to Borsley \[Borsley, 1987; Borsley, 1989\].The analysis makes use of valence features which encodethe subcategorization requirements of the sign.eThis imphes the parameterization for Italian ofSchema 2 in order to allow partially saturated phrases.
(Compare \[Pollard, 1990\]).
Schema 2 describes phrasesconsisting of a lexical head daughter and any number ofcomplement daughters.
One problem which is related tohaving a VP as complement is that of spurious ambigu-ity if a non clitic complement is present.
The possibilityof having a V as complement instead of a VP is underinvestigation; see also \[Rizzi, 1982\] which postulates thepresence of a V if restructuring has applied.
Under this439Auxiliaries should have a lexical entry like the fol-lowing (only relevant features are mentioned): 7(11) Lexical entry for auxiliary verbHEAD V \[+ AUX\]SUBJ <\[-i'\] N P tnoml )COMPS(\ [~\]  VP  SUBJ (E \ ]NP  )COMPS L(+) L )The \[-CL\] restriction prevents an auxiliary from com-bining with a VP whose head has already combinedwith a clitic, since all cliticized verb forms are speci-fied as \[+CL\] in the lexicon.
In the case of auxiliaries,clitic climbing is obligatory and a sentence like thefollowing must be ruled out:(12) * Maria ha lettoloMaria has read cl.
(acc)'Maria has read it'The \[-CL\] lexical specification on the VP complementselected by the auxiliary achieves this purpose; let-tolo will be marked as \[+CL\] and will consequentlynot meet the specifications of the lexical entry forauxiliaries which forces the verbal complement to be\[-CL\].
Sentence (12) will be correctly ruled out.
Thecombination of a clitic with a past participle cannotbe ruled out in general in Italian, since the followingsentence is grammatical:(13) Vistolo, fu facile decidereSeenpa,t.part cl., was easy to decide'Having seen him, it was easy to decide'It is only when the past participle combines with theauxiliary that the clitic must attach to the latter.As for semantic role assignment, it proceeds in avery straightforward way.
In HPSG roles are as-signed within the lexical entry: a role is assigned bymeans of structure sharing between the index of anelement in the SUBJ /COMPS list and the value ofsome attribute of the verb's CONTENT value.
Roleassignment, as well as case assignment, occurs withinthe lexicon.
If a clitic is present, it will be assignedsemantic role and case through the link created viastructure sharing.An  example will be given to illustrate the mecha-nism and the interaction of the two lexical rules inhypothesis it won't be necessary to parameterize Schema2 and the spurious ambiguity will be avoided, at leastwith auxiliaries, if all complements of the past partici-ple are forced to rMse.
See \[AbeiUe and Godard, 1993\]for a similar solution for French.
Furthermore, the useof the \[-CL\] feature (see below) imposed on the comple-ment of a restructuring verb is also superfluous under theassumption that all the complements of V should raise.7Here L stands for the list of complements subcatego-rized by the lower verb.the analysis of a sentence like (3).
In this case theverb ha has the following complement list:(14) Example of the complement list of haCOMPS < VP \[COMPS <iP \ [acc \ ]>\ ] ,  NP \[acc\] >The auxiliary verb takes a VP and the NP argu-ment of the VP which was not realized within it.This will undergo LRCL1 to produce the followingfor the cliticized verb form l'ha, where the slot re-lated to the NP is removed from the subcategoriza-tion requirement of the auxiliary and the presence ofthe clitic is imposed:(15) Example of the complement list of l' haCOMPS < VP \[COMPS <NP\[acc\]>\]>Clitic climbing with restructuring verbs can behandled by the same mechanism, but in this casethe climbing of the clitic is optional.
In such a situ-ation a lexical rule can be used; given the followinginput (only relevant features are mentioned):(16) Input of lexical rule (LRCL2)HEAD VVCLASS modal;aspect ual;motionSUBJ (NP\ [~)COMPS(F\]VP \[ SUBJ( NPVi\]) \ ]COMPS LThis will be the output produced (only relevant fea-tures are mentioned):(17) Output of lexical rule (LRCL2)HEAD VVCLASS modal;aspectual;motionSUBJ (NP~)  \[\[-CL\] \]COMPS(~\] VP SUBJ(NPri \] )COMPS L(+) L )The left hand side (input) of the lexical rule accountsfor cases where the clitic doesn't climb as in sen-tence (4b); in this case there is no argument raisingand LRCL I  applies, checking off the slot related tothe full complement and triggering the cliticized verbform.
If clitic climbing occurs as in (4a), there is ar-gument raising and the right hand side (output) ofthe lexical rule will account for it; in this specific casethe restructuring verb will subcategorize for the ver-bal complement and for the argument of the verbalcomplement.
Again LRCL1 will trigger the cliticizedverb form.Clitic climbing trigger verbs also subcategorize fora VP  \[-CL\]; this avoids sentences where there are440two clitics with one attaching to the lower verb andthe other to the higher one.
In Italian, if there aretwo clitics that originate as complements of the sameverb, they must cliticize together:(18) a. Piero voleva darmeloPiero wanted to give cl.
(dat) cl.
(acc)'Piero wanted to give it to me'b.
Piero me lo voleva darePiero cl.
(dat) cl.
(acc) wanted to give'Piero wanted to give it to me'The clitics cannot be split:(19) * Piero lo voleva darmiPiero cl.
(acc) wanted to give cl.
(dat)'Piero wanted to give it to me'The restriction on the VP doesn't allow argumentraising if the VP already has a clitic as its daugh-ter.
In the specific case of sentence (19), darmi willbe marked as \[+CL\] and will not match the require-ments imposed by the right hand side of LRCL2;therefore no argument raising will take place and thesentence will be correctly ruled out.
As for (18a) and(18b) they will be handled by the left hand side andby the right hand side of LRCL2 respectively.
Lexi-cal rule LRCL1 will be responsible in both cases forthe cliticized verb form.If there is more than one restructuring verb, onecan get sequences like the following, where the cliticis attached to the higher verb:(20) Maria lo vuole poter comprareMaria cl.
(acc) wants can buy'Maria wants to be able to buy it'The application of lexical rule LRCL2 is thereforetriggered twice so that the higher verb will subcate-gorize also for the complement ofthe lower one.
Lex-ical rule LRCL1 will be responsible for the cliticizedverb form.An advantage of this approach is that the possi-bility of subcategorizing for the complements of thelower VP is restricted to auxiliary and clitic climbingtrigger verbs.
Therefore a sentence like (5) will beruled out since the main verb is not lexically markedas a clitic climbing trigger and will not undergo lex-ical rule LRCL2 which allows argument raising.
Inthis way the fact that clitic climbing occurs only withcertain verbs can be naturally captured by the mech-anism; only auxiliary verbs and restructuring verbswill trigger argument raising and no special ocalityconstraints are necessary.4.2 ExtensionsRestructuring verbs as in \[Rizzi, 1982\] not only havethe property of allowing clitic climbing, they also al-low long NP-movement as in:(21) Queste case si vogliono vendere a caroThese houses SI want to sell at highprezzoprice'These houses are wanted to be sold at highprice'In this kind of construction the object of the lowerverb, queste case, is allowed to raise and become thesubject of the main verb; this option being avail-able only with restructuring verbs.
It can be shownthat a functional composition approach can easilyaccount for this kind of construction, s Lexical ruleLlq.CL2 allows raising of the NP object of the lowerVP which becomes a complement of the restructur-ing verb.
The clitic si acts as a passivizing ele-ment in this kind of construction and will triggerthe HPSG mechanism that handles passive construc-tions; namely a lexical rule that acts on the subcat-egorization requirements of the relevant verb, mak-ing the object become the subject as in \[Pollard andSag, 1987\].
The NP object will therefore become thesubject of the restructuring verb and agreement willbe handled by the usual mechanism responsible forsubject-verb agreement.5 ConclusionAn analysis for the treatment of clitic climbing inItalian has been proposed.
It relies on the idea thatauxiliaries and clitic climbing trigger verbs subcat-egorize for a VP and for the raised complements ofthe VP.
This analysis allows a unified treatment forthe simple cases, namely when a clitic attaches toa host that subcategorizes for it and for the caseswhere clitics are involved in nonlocal dependencies.It has been shown that the analysis rules out ill-formed sentences.
It is not necessary to state specificconstraints that would be required in a treatmentbased on nonlocal features and the Nonlocal FeaturePrinciple, which is another possible way to handlenonlocal dependencies in HPSG.
Furthermore, theapproach can easily account for another property ofrestructuring verbs namely long NP-movement.AcknowledgmentsI am grateful to Anne Abeille, Hap Kolb, PhilipMiller, Ivan Sag, Wietske Sijtsma and to a numberof collegues from ITK and GM for comments anddiscussion.References\[Abeille and Godard, 1993\] A.
