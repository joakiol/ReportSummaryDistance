IFTs are a cer ta in  k ind ofclassification of utterances concerning speaker'smeaning.
DPs present background informationof language use in order to derive an appropriateexpression from speaker's meaning.
In Japanese,IFTs can be derived automatical ly throughsyntactical constraints.
To generate appropriateexpressions, language-specific communicationstrategies related to DP values should be given apriori.
The whole process is performed in aunification-based framework.1.
IntroductionIn devising a machine translation system oftelephone dialogues, one of the problems i  how toadequately translate tile underlying meaning ofthe source utterance, or the speaker's intention,into the target language.
Such a concern is rarelyobserved in conventional machine translationresearch,  which has focused on st r ic t lyg rammat ica l  t rans la t ion  d ivorced fromconsideration of the speaker's ituation andintentions (Tsujii and Nagao 1988).
However, indialogue, smoothness of communication dependson perceiving the speaker's intention.
Especiallywhen dealing with different language familypairs such as Japanese and Engl ish,  it isnecessary to have a methodology of treatinglanguage-specific communication strategies in auniversal framework.Although the input of our machine translationsystem is spoken dialogue, here we leave asidethe issues of speech processing and limit ourdiscussion to l inguistic processing.
Extra-grammatical sentence patterns uch as intra-sentential correction, stammering, and inversionare not treated either.
Our framework fortranslating speaker's intention is based on twonotions, Illoeutionary Force Types (IFTs), i.e.
aclassification of the speaker's intentions, andDecision Parameters  (DPs), i.e.
featuresrepresenting different factors relevant o speech-act-related expressions.
Though plan-basedapproaches to speech acts such as Allen andPerrault (1980) are ideal, too little is known inthis field to apply it to actual natural anguageprocessing.
Therefore, we adopt here a moderate,intrascntential, syntactic method that can serveas further input to plan-based approaches.In section 2 of this paper we discuss therelation between intent ion and speech-actindirectness, and call intention thus described"speaker's meaning."
In section 3 we define IFTs.In section 4 we fully utilize syntactic onstraintsin Japanese in order to extract II~rs from inpututterances.
In section 5 we present DPs asstrategies for expressing IFTs in the targetlanguage.
Finally, we make conclusions on thisframework.2.
Speaker's meaning in an utterance2.1.
What Is speaker's meaning?When the speaker utters a sentence, thehearer eceives communicative signs in additionto propositional content.
According to speech acttheory, these signs are classified as illocutionaryforces governed by certain felicity conditions(Searle 1969).
Speech act theory is one of themain themes of pragmatics, but it remains tooconceptual to be of practical assistance to naturallanguage processing.
However, i l locutionaryforces can be useful to machine translation ifpropositional content is d ist inguished fromstructure in the analysis of intention.- 264-We begin by noting that intent ions andsur face  express ions  have  mul t ip lecorrespondences.
As the following exampleshows, a single surface expression can conveyseveral intentions:(2-1) gakusei waribiki wa nai no desy6 ks?student discount TOP exist-NOT EXPL-POL QUESTIsn't there a student discount?l l !REQUESTINGCOMPLAININGADVISINGCONFIRMING...etc.Conversely, the same intention can be conveyedthrough various surface expressions, as in thefollowing variations of (2-1):REQUESTINGI l l(2-2) gakusei waribiki o site kudasai.student discount OBJ make do-GIVFAV-POL-IMPPlease make me a student discount.
(2-3) gakusei waribiki o site itadaki taistudent discount OBJ make do-RECFAV-PO|, wantnodesu ga.EXI'I,-I'OL MODEl{1 wonder ifyou could make me a student discount.
(2-4) watasi wa gakusei na no desu ga.!
TOP student COPL EXPL-POL MODERI am a student, you know.N.B.
Concerning a 'discount' request, (2-2) seems a bitstrong for a real situation although there is no specificcontexttml condition to decide definitely if it is or not.
(2-1)(2-3) and (2-4) are seen in our data.These examples clearly show that intention iscontext-dependent, and that to understand thespeaker 's  meaning correctly,  an inferencemechanism is necessary.Various surface xpression patterns give cluesfor ascertaining illocutionary forces (Wierzbicka1986).
(2-5) t~rokuydsi o o-okuri negae masu ks?registration form OBJ send-POL desire POL QUESTCan you please send me a registration form7(2-6) Could you kindly send them all together?Hegau in (2-5), a verb for request, and ks, thesentence-final particle of questions, indicaterequest.
Kindly in (2-6) signals a request inEnglish.
In other words, even without knowledgeof the context of an utterance, knowledge ofcommunicstive strategies of language and theirexpression patterns allow the der ivat ion ofintentions from utterances.In the above examples, we can see there arevarious ways of expressing requests.
Thisindirectness derives from social patterns inrequesting things common to all cultures to somedegree.
On the other hand, however, it dependson each specific society.
In this paper we acceptindirectness as an unavoidable and basic featureof spoken utterances, and deal with indirectpatterns uch in (2-1) and (2-3) that will be calledspeech-act indirectness.
Indirect expressions suchas (2-4), which are ca l led propos i t iona lindirectness, are not treated for the reason givenin the next subsection.
We use the term speaker'smeaning to refer to intention expressed byspeech-act indirectness.
Using this notion, we tryto capture syntactically the major portion ofspeech-act - re la ted  express ions  in spokenJapanese.2.2.
Translat ion of speaker 's  meaningWe assume that for machine translation it issufficient o understand utterances on the level ofspeech-act indirectness, without referring topropositional indirectness.
On the one hand,when there is a large degree of indirectness suchas the omission of propositional content in (2-4)where the topic "discount fee for students" is notactually mentioned, we must be content with adirect translation of what has been stated.
This isbecause a sentence-based translat ion cannotcompensate for the missing content.
In addition,since the hearer will no doubt be able to infersomething about he omitted content anyway, thespeaker is best served by a direct translationclosest o the original.
On the other hand, whenthe propositional content is explicitly phrased butrequires indirectness to make an appropriatetranslation into the target language, a systemthat concentrates on speech-act indirectness willagain be tile most useful, because socio-linguisticdifferences will be expressed typically in speech-act  ind i rec tness  as in (2-1) and (2-3).Consequently, we develop a framework aimed atextracting speaker's meaning in terms of speech-act indirectness.3.
I FTs3.1.Classiflcatlon of IFTsAn experiment has been carr ied out oncollected data of spoken-style inter-terminaldialogues to extract i l locutionary acts.
Thesubject of the conversations was l imited to- 265  -application for an international conference, andthe content was mainly on inquiry, request, andconfirmation about the conference between asecretary and an applicant.We classify surface IFTs into six types (Table1).
This is the immediate result of the analysismade intrasententially by means of Head-DrivenPhrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)/JapanesePhrase Structure Grammar (JPSG).
The sixtypes are differentiated from each other only bymeans of the uppermost predicate value that isthe result of the surface-based analysis.
Forexample, an indirect request with an inter-rogative sentence pattern such as(2-5) t6rokuySsi  o o-okur i  negae masu ha?Could you please send me a registration form?is classified simply as an INTERROGATIVEtype, though it is OPTATIVE at the deep IFTlevel.
Also, a sentence with an active, present-tense verb such as(3-1) tdrohuyOsi o o-ohuri  si masuregistration form OBJ  send-POL do-POLI will send you a registration form.is analyzed as INFORMATIVE ,  though it isPROMISE  at the deep level.Table 1.

Incontrast o a conventional machine translationprocedure, speaker's meaning can be analyzedand generated, without passing through transfer,by means of IFTs and DPs.
Here, we do notpursue machine translation problems concerningpropositional content.
The processing ofspeaker's meaning consists of two stages,unification-based syntactico-semantic analysisand plan inference.
We will now give a moreprecise description ofthese two stages.INPUT1analysis l--I It .

Speaker's meaning translation procedureAs a grammar for surface-level analysis, wehave adopted HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1987) andJSPG (Gunji 1987), that is a modification of theformer for dealing with Japanese.
On the basis ofa unification parser developed at ATR (Kogure etal.
1988), the grammar has been written andproven capable of analyzing all fundamentalsentence patterns in spoken-style Japaneseconversation (Yoshimoto, Kogure and Iida 1989).This grammar analyzes sentence (3-2) as (3-3)by means of syntactic rules and lexicaldescriptions, of which only those for thesubsidiary verb morau are given as (3-4).

is a prefix for a tag name representing atoken identity of feature structures.
In (3-4), thethird member of the SUBCAT value specifies theconjugational form and modality type of thecomplement verb.
The feature MODL imposesconditions on the modality type that plays a keyrole in Japanese syntax by dominating mutualpredicate component subcategorization andsubordination.
In order to handle the unordered-hess of Japanese case phrases, the SUB\[ATvalue is a set, following JPSG, instead of anordered list in the HPSG for English.
The set isexpanded by a rule reader into its correspondingpossible ordered list descriptions.
Since Japanesecase phrases are always postposed by a case-indicator, they are assigned to the part-of-speechcategory P. The PRAG feature stipulates herethat the speaker empathizes more with thesubject (?X1 in (3-4)) than with the indirect object(?X2).This pragmatic information is further utilizedwith a discourse model to identify omittedsubjects and objects, because they are mostlyomitted in honori f ic  or empathy- re la tedsentences.4.
Identification of IFTsThe surface analysis result such as (3-3)serves as an input to plan schemata called IFT-Schemata that identify deep IFTs (or merelyIFTs) syntactical ly by means of predicate-internal collocation, adjunction, tense, and modalinformation.
An IFT-Schema consists of a goalwhose value is a partial description of a deep IFT,and a decomposition whose value is a disjunctionof par t ia l  descr ipt ions  of surface IFTs,preconditions, and effects as in (4-1), (4-2) and (4-3).
A surface IFT is searched for which unifieswith one of the descriptions in the decompostion.The goal in the same schema is the resulting deepIFT.
Adoption of the unification method enableshi-directional f ow of information between thedeep speech act type and the decomposition.
Thisleads to an eas ier  d i sambiguat ion  andsupplementation f surface analysis results bylinguistically specifying IFTs (Kogure et el.1988).The difference between surface analyses anddeep IFTs is absorbed by a "thesaurus", as in (4-4), that relates the two.
This specifies thatMORAU-RECEIVE-FAVOR is a subtype ofRECEIVE-FAVOR.
(4-5) is the result of the IFTinference.

Also, OPTATIVE islimited to second person recipient.
For example,(4-6) ?SBJ kaigi ni mdsikomi tai.conference OBJ2 reserve wantI would like to register for the conference.
(4-7) ~SBJ kaigi ni mdsikomi tai sd do.conferenceOBJ2 reserve want l-hearI hear (someone) wants to register for the conference.While sentence (4-6) with the present, non-modalaux i l i a ry  tai (want  to) be longs  to theSUBJECTIVE type, (4-7) with the evidentialmodality belongs to the ASSER'ITVE type.
Thisfact is ut i l ized, by means of two lexicaldescriptions of tai and IFT-Schemata restrictingthe decomposition members' person, tense, andmodal information, to identify the omitted subjectof(4-6) as the first person, and that of(4-7) as thethird person.On the other hand, adverbials that exclusivelymodi fy  deep IFTs are also u t i l i zed  indisambiguating IFTs, For example, a sentencewith O-Regal s imasu (request, implore) isambiguous among OPTATIVE, ASSERTIVE,and PROMISE.
If it is modified by dEzo (please),however, the sentence is always an OPI'ATIVEtype.Deep IFTs with their corresponding syntacticconstraints are diagramed by Table 2.
Instancesin the Table indicate each of the correspondingdeep IFTs, but the opposite is not necessarilytrue.
For example, a deep IFT OPTATIVE can beindicated by complex predicates that belong tothe surface category INTERROGATIVE orASSERTIVE.
Table 3 illustrates the relationbetween the deep IFT OPTATIVE and itscorresponding surface IFT with instances.Table 2.

Thisenables an adequate English translation (4-8)instead of an inappropriate literal translation (4-9).
Note that at the same time the subject andindirect object missing in the surface sentence arecompensated for by the IFT specification of theagent and recipient.

Necessity of DPsWe can summarize the difference betweenJapanese and English communication behavioras follows:Japanese interpersonal relation is the mostessential factorEnglish in terpersona l  re la t ion  isessential, but how to convey orread in tent ions  is moreimportantFor example, (5-1) is an utterance from a boss to asecretary to request him to work overtime.
ThisJapanese utterance is not an order because it isexpressed in a polite way using the negativeinterrogative.
This kind of request isnot unusualin Japanese because of the priority given to socialstanding.
Because Japanese think a requestphrased like this is normal, the Engl ishtranslation shown in (5-1) using can and sorryseems appropriate to them, too.
But actually anappropriate translation requires a more politeexpression that addresses the secretary'sinconvenience, as in (5-1)'.
Thus, to get anappropriate translation of (5-1), we mustreconsider from the viewpoint of the targetlanguage interpersonal relations between thespeaker and the hearer and the inconvenience ofrequested action for the hearer.
(5-1) sumanaiga, zangyd site syorui osorry work overtime documentsOBJtaipu site kure nai ha na?type do-GIVFEV NEG QUESTSorry, but can you stay late to type these documents?
(5-1)' Do you think you could possibly stay lateto type these documents?To resolve these communicative differencesbetween Japanese and English, we assume fourkinds of parameterlzed factors, which we callDecision Parameters  (DPs).
These are:interpersonal relation, cost-benefit relation,definiteness of propos i t ional  content, andtopicality of propositional content.
Interpersonalrelation indicates the situational relationshipbetween utterance participants as constituted byage, social status, familiarity, gender, and theother factors governing use of Japanesehonorifics.
Cost-benefit relat ion indicateswhether the action intended by the speaker'sutterance is convenient to the speaker or to thehearer.
Definiteness of propositional contentmeans whether propositional content is routineor easily performed work, or whether it requiresadditional or unusual work.
Topicality o fpropositional content is related to the position ofan utterance in discourse, which means whetheror not the speaker's intention is already implied.Table 4 shows these four parameters and theirvalues.
In particular, DP4 or topicality presentsdiscourse informat ion which affects thepoliteness level of surface expressions.
In thepresent experimental situation, extraction ofspeaker's meaning is l imited to isolatedutterances separate from discourse structure, but- 269  -to get appropriate xpressions in generation, weneed DP4 in connection with a discourse model.Table 4.

Selection of sur face IFT by referr ing toI)P valuesIn the plan inference method of generation, weuse DPs in order to get appropriate Englishsurface IFTs to convey IFTs in English.
Since weare limiting the input to a task-oriented domainlike conferences, we can re-state input in termsof propositional content.
This propositionalcontent is then measured in terms of the three DPvalues as a default (Table 5).Table 5.
Default values of DPsPropositional Content DP1 DP2 DP3\[A\] Request(from a client to a secretary)*(1) send a registration form HR SP ROU(2) inform about the conference HR SP ROU(3) assist a hotel accomodation HR SP ROU(4) provide an interpreter HR SP UNS(5) give a student discount HR SP UNS(6) reimburse a fee HR SP UNS(7) come for to the station HR SP U NS\[S\] Request(from a secretariy to a client)(8) send back the registration form HR SP ROU(9) tell one's name and address HR SP ROU(10) make a registration procedure HR SP ROU(11) pay by bank transfer HR SP UNS(12) take part in the party HR SP UNS(13) be informed about persons HR SP UNSwho wish to participate*In bt, siness telephone conversations in English, thehearer is always considered tobe in a higher position,even in the case of a boss to a secretary.
So the value ofDP1 for \[A\] is always IlR.We suppose that differences between Japaneseand English consist in the different amount ofDPs we should refer to when extracting surfaceIFTs.
Japanese surface IFTs will be concernedwith DP1 and DP2 since Japanese xpressions donot stress speaker's intention, whereas Englishsurface IFTs will range over all four DPs andproduce a larger range of appropriate translationchoices.For example, (1) and (7) ofTable 5 which differin definiteness of propositional content (i.e.routine or unusual), can be generated in the sameway in Japanese, which involves only DP1 andDP2.
That is,(5-2) t6rokuydsi o okut-te moral tairegistration form OBJ send do-RBCFAV wantno desu ga. ---(1)EXPL-POL MODER(5-3) eki made mukaeni hi-re moral taistation LOC come for do-RECFAV wantno desu ga. ---(7)EXPL-POL MODERIn English, however, these propositional contentswill be generated in different expressions.
In case(7), to convey the unusual but really necessary'picking up' request, an adequate xpressionrequires more politeness.
(5-2)' Could you sehd me a registration formplease?
---(1)(5-3)' Ca) I was wondering i f l  could have someonepick me up at the station.
---(7)(b) Would it be possible for someone to pickme up at the station, please?
---(7)With reference to discourse information, DP4,the appropiate English surface IFT will be gradedup or down depending on its position in thediscourse.
The mapping from Japanese surfaceIFT to English surface IFT is schematized as inTable 6.
We can categorize English requestexpressions into two kinds.
One is d i rectexpressions with please, which we call PLEASE,and others are expressions containing severallevels of politeness uch as could you...?, is itpossible to...?, I am wondering, etc., which we callPLEASE-PLUS.
Japanese surface IFTs areseparated into two types, INTERROGATIVE ando thers ,  i.e.
dec lara t ive  requests  us ingOPTATIVE, SUBJECTIVE or ASSERTIVE type.When a Japanese  sur face  IFT  isINTERROGATIVE as in (5-4) and (5-5), and ifthe IFT is a l ready  impl ied in p reced ingutterances, the English surface IFT can be- 270-expressed simply with PLEASE type as in (5-4)'and (5-5)', otherwise it should be expressed inPLEASE-PLUS type such as several kinds ofEnglish speech-act indirectness as in (5-4)" and(5-5)".
On the other hand, when the Japanesesurface IFT is others such as OPTATIVE orSUBJECTIVE as in (5-2) and (5-3), and if IFT isalready implied in preceding utterances, theEnglish surface IFT should be expressed inPLEASE-PLUS as in (5-2)" and (5-3)".Table 6.

ConclusionWe proposed in this paper a descript iveframework for translating speaker's meaning in adialogue translation system.
This framework isbased on two notions, Illocutionary Force typesand Decision Parameters ,  and is aimed atextracting speaker's meaning in terms of speech-act  ind i rec tness  s ince  we be l ieve  thatpropositional and speech-act indirectness mustboth be processed separately.AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to Dr. Kurematsu,the president of ATR Interpreting TelephonyResearch Labs, Dr. Aizawa, the head of theLinguistic Processing Department, and all themembers  of the L ingu is t i c  P rocess ingDepar tment  for the i r  constant  help andencouragement.ReferencesAllen, James and Raymond Perrault, 1980, "AnalyzingIntention in Utterances."
