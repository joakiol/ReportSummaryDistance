Chapman, David Chu, John N. DowlingDepartment of Biomedical InformaticsUniversity of PittsburghPittsburgh, PAchapman@cbmi.pitt.eduAbstractApplications using automatically indexedclinical conditions must account for con-textual features such as whether a conditionis negated, historical or hypothetical, orexperienced by someone other than the pa-tient.
We developed and evaluated an algo-rithm called ConText, an extension of theNegEx negation algorithm, which relies ontrigger terms, pseudo-trigger terms, andtermination terms for identifying the valuesof three contextual features.
In spite of itssimplicity, ConText performed well atidentifying negation and hypothetical status.ConText performed moderately at identify-ing whether a condition was experiencedby someone other than the patient andwhether the condition occurred historically.1 IntroductionNatural language processing (NLP) techniques canextract variables from free-text clinical recordsimportant for medical informatics applications per-forming decision support, quality assurance, andbiosurveillance [1-6].
Many applications have fo-cused on identifying individual clinical conditionsin textual records, which is the first step in makingthe conditions available to computerized applica-tions.
However, identifying individual instances ofclinical conditions is not sufficient for many medi-cal informatics tasks?the context surrounding thecondition is crucial for integrating the informationwithin the text to determine the clinical state of apatient.For instance, it is important to understandwhether a condition is affirmed or negated, acuteor chronic, or mentioned hypothetically.
We referto these as contextual features, because the infor-mation is not usually contained in the lexical repre-sentation of the clinical condition itself but in thecontext surrounding the clinical condition.
We de-veloped an algorithm called ConText for identify-ing three contextual features relevant for biosur-veillance from emergency department (ED) reportsand evaluated its performance compared to physi-cian annotation of the features.2 Background2.1 Encoding Contextual Information from-Clinical TextsNLP systems designed to encode detailed informa-tion from clinical reports, such as MedLEE [1],MPLUS [7], and MedSyndikate [4], encode con-textual features such as negation, uncertainty,change over time, and severity.
Over the last tenyears, several negation algorithms have been de-scribed in the literature [8-12].
Recently, research-ers at Columbia University have categorized tem-poral expressions in clinical narrative text andevaluated a temporal constraint structure designedto model the temporal information for dischargesummaries [13, 14].ConText differs from most other work in thisarea by providing a stand-alone algorithm that canbe integrated with any application that indexesclinical conditions from text.2.2 Biosurveillance from ED DataBiosurveillance and situational awareness are im-perative research issues in today?s world.
State-of-the-art surveillance systems rely on chief com-plaints and ICD-9 codes, which provide limitedclinical information and have been shown to per-form with only fair to moderate sensitivity [15-18].ED reports are a timely source of clinical informa-81tion that may be useful for syndromic surveillance.We are developing NLP-based methods for identi-fying clinical conditions from ED reports.2.3 SySTRWe are developing an NLP application calledSySTR (Syndromic Surveillance from Textual Re-cords).
It currently uses free-text descriptions ofclinical conditions in ED reports to determinewhether the patient has an acute lower respiratorysyndrome.
We previously identified 55 clinicalconditions (e.g.
cough, pneumonia, oxygen desatu-ration, wheezing) relevant for determining whethera patient has an acute lower respiratory condition[19].
SySTR identifies instances of these 55 clini-cal conditions in ED reports to determine if a pa-tient has an acute lower respiratory syndrome.SySTR has four modules:(1) Index each instance of the 55 clinical condi-tions in an ED report;(2) For each indexed instance of a clinical condi-tion, assign values to three contextual features;(3) Integrate the information from indexed in-stances to determine whether each of the 55conditions are acute, chronic, or absent;(4) Use the values of the 55 conditions to deter-mine whether a patient has an acute lower res-piratory syndrome.We built SySTR on top of an applicationcalled caTIES [20], which comprises a GATEpipeline of processing resources (http://gate.ac.uk/).Module 1 uses MetaMap [5] to index UMLS con-cepts in the text and then maps the UMLS conceptsto the 55 clinical conditions.
For instance, Module1 would identify the clinical condition Dyspnea inthe sentence ?Patient presents with a 3 day historyof shortness of breath.?
For each instance of the 55conditions identified by Module 1, Module 2 as-signs values to three contextual features: Negation(negated, affirmed); Temporality (historical, re-cent, hypothetical); and Experiencer (patient,other).
For the sentence above, Module 2 wouldassign Dyspnea the following contextual featuresand their values: Negation?affirmed; Temporal-ity?recent; Experiencer?patient.
Module 3, asdescribed in Chu and colleagues [21], resolvescontradictions among multiple instances of clinicalconditions, removes conditions not experienced bythe patient, and assigns a final value of acute,chronic, or absent to each of the 55 conditions.Module 4 uses machine learning models to deter-mine whether a patient has acute lower respiratorysyndrome based on values of the conditions.The objective of this study was to evaluate analgorithm for identifying the contextual informa-tion generated by Module 2.3 MethodsWe developed an algorithm called ConText fordetermining the values for three contextual featuresof a clinical condition: Negation, Temporality, andExperiencer.
The same algorithm is applied to allthree contextual features and is largely based on aregular expression algorithm for determiningwhether a condition is negated or not (NegEx [9]).ConText relies on trigger terms, pseudo-triggerterms, and scope termination terms that are specificto the type of contextual feature being identified.Below we describe the three contextual featuresaddressed by the algorithm, details of how Con-Text works, and our evaluation of ConText.3.1 Three Contextual FeaturesDetermining whether a patient had an acute epi-sode of a clinical condition, such as cough, poten-tially involves information described in the contextof the clinical condition in the text.
We performeda pilot study to learn which contextual features af-fected classification of 55 clinical conditions asacute, chronic, or absent [21].
The pilot studyidentified which contextual features were criticalfor our task and reduced the number of values weinitially used.The contextual features for each indexed clinicalcondition are assigned default values.
ConTextchanges the values if the condition falls within thescope of a relevant trigger term.
Below, we de-scribe the contextual features (default values are inparentheses).
(1) Negation (affirmed): ConText determineswhether a condition is negated, as in ?No fe-ver.?
(2) Temporality (recent): ConText can changeTemporality to historical or hypothetical.
In itscurrent implementation, historical is defined asbeginning at least 14 days before the visit tothe ED, but the algorithm can easily be modi-fied to change the length of time.
ConTextwould mark Fever in ?Patient should return ifshe develops fever?
as hypothetical.82(3) Experiencer (patient): ConText assigns condi-tions ascribed to someone other than the pa-tient an Experiencer of other, as in ?The pa-tient?s father has a history of CHF.
?3.2 Contextual Feature AlgorithmAs we examined how the contextual features weremanifested in ED reports, we discovered similarpatterns for all features and hypothesized that anexisting negation algorithm, NegEx [9], may beapplicable for all three features.NegEx uses two regular expressions (RE) to de-termine whether an indexed condition is negated:RE1: <trigger term> <5w> <indexed term>RE2: <indexed term> <5w> <trigger term><5w> represents five words (a word can be a sin-gle word or a UMLS concept), and the textmatched by this pattern is called the scope.
NegExrelies on three types of terms to determine whethera condition is negated: trigger terms, pseudo-trigger terms, and termination terms.
Trigger termssuch as ?no?
and ?denies?
indicate that the clinicalconditions that fall within the scope of the triggerterm should be negated.
Pseudo-trigger terms, suchas ?no increase,?
contain a negation trigger termbut do not indicate negation of a clinical concept.A termination term such as ?but?
can terminate thescope of the negation before the end of the win-dow, as in ?She denies headache but complains ofdizziness.
?ConText is an expansion of NegEx.
It relies onthe same basic algorithm but applies different termlists and different windows of scope depending onthe contextual feature being annotated.3.3 ConText Term ListsEach contextual feature has a unique set of triggerterms and pseudo-trigger terms, as shown in Table1.
The complete list of terms can be found athttp://web.cbmi.pitt.edu/chapman/ConText.html.Most of the triggers apply to RE1, but a few(marked in table) apply to RE2.
ConText assigns adefault value to each feature, then changes thatvalue if a clinical condition falls within the scopeof a relevant trigger term.Although trigger terms are unique to the contex-tual feature being identified, termination termsTable 1.
Examples of trigger and pseudo-trigger terms for the three contextual features.
If all terms are notrepresented in the table, we indicate the number of terms used by ConText in parentheses.Temporality (default = recent)Trigger terms forhypotheticalPseudo-triggerterms Trigger terms for historical Pseudo-trigger terms (10)ifreturnshould [he|she]should thereshould the patientas neededcome back [for|to]if negativeGeneral triggershistoryprevious^History Section title^^Temporal Measurement triggers^^^<time> of[for|over] the [last|past] <time>since (last) [day-of-week|week|month|season|year]history, physicalhistory takingpoor historyhistory and examinationhistory of present illnesssocial historyfamily historysudden onset ofExperiencer (default = patient)  Negation (default = affirmed)Trigger termsfor other (12)Pseudo-triggertermsTrigger terms for negated (125) Pseudo-trigger terms (16)father(?s)mother(?s)aunt(?s)nonotdenieswithoutno increasenot extendgram negative^  the scope for ?previous?
only extends one term forward (e.g., ?for previous headache?
)^^Currently the only history section title we use is PAST MEDICAL HISTORY.^^^ <time> includes the following regular expression indicating a temporal quantification: x[-|space][day(s)|hour(s)|week(s)|month(s)|year(s)].
x = any digit; words in brackets are disjunctions; items in parentheses areoptional.
The first two temporal measurement triggers are used with RE1; the third is used with RE2.
For ourcurrent application, a condition lasting 14 days or more is considered historical.83may be common to multiple contextual features.For instance, a termination term indicating that thephysician is speaking about the patient can indicatetermination of scope for the features Temporalityand Experiencer.
In the sentence ?History ofCOPD, presenting with shortness of breath,?
thetrigger term ?history?
indicates that COPD is his-torical, but the term ?presenting?
terminates thescope of the temporality trigger term, because thephysician is now describing the current patientvisit.
Therefore, the condition Dyspnea (?shortnessof breath?)
should be classified as recent.
Simi-larly, in the sentence ?Mother has CHF and patientpresents with chest pain,?
Experiencer for CHFshould be other, but Experiencer for Chest Painshould be patient.We compiled termination terms into conceptualgroups, as shown in Table 2.Table 2.
ConText?s termination terms.
Column 1 liststhe type of termination term, the number of terms usedby Context, and the contextual feature values using thattype of termination term.
Column 2 gives examples ofthe terms.Type of Term ExamplesPatient (5)Temporal (hypothetical)Experiencer (other)Patient, who, his, her, pa-tient?sPresentation (12)Temporal (historical)Experiencer (other)Presents, presenting, com-plains, was found, states,reports, currently, todayBecause (2)Temporal (hypothetical) Since, becauseWhich (1)Experiencer (other) WhichED (2)Temporal (historical) Emergency department, EDBut (8)Negation (negated)But, however, yet, though,although, aside from3.4 ConText AlgorithmThe input to ConText is an ED report with in-stances of the 55 clinical concepts already indexed.For each clinical condition, ConText assigns val-ues to the three contextual features.
ConText?s al-gorithm is as follows1:1 This algorithm applies to RE1.
The algorithm for RE2is the same, except that it works backwards from thetrigger term and does not look for pseudo-trigger terms.Go to first trigger term in sentenceIf term is a pseudo-trigger term,Skip to next trigger termDetermine scope of trigger termIf termination term within scope,Terminate scope before termination termAssign appropriate contextual feature value toall indexed clinical concepts within scope.The scope of a trigger term depends on the con-textual feature being classified.
The default scopeincludes all text following the indexed conditionuntil the end of the sentence.
Thus, in the sentence?He should return for fever?
the scope of the Tem-porality (hypothetical) trigger term ?return?
in-cludes the segment ?for fever,?
which includes anindexed condition Fever.
The default scope is over-ridden in a few circumstances.
First, as describedabove, the scope can be terminated by a relevanttermination term.
Second, if the trigger term is a<section title>, the scope extends throughout theentire section, which is defined previous to Con-Text?s processing.
Third, a trigger term itself canrequire a different scope.
The Temporality (histori-cal) term ?previous?
only extends one term for-ward in the sentence.3.5 EvaluationWe evaluated ConText?s ability to assign correctvalues to the three contextual features by compar-ing ConText?s annotations with annotations madeby a physician.Setting and Subjects.
The study was conducted onreports for patients presenting to the University ofPittsburgh Medical Center Presbyterian HospitalED during 2002.
The study was approved by theUniversity of Pittsburgh?s Institutional ReviewBoard.
We randomly selected 120 reports for pa-tients with respiratory-related ICD-9 discharge di-agnoses for manual annotation.
For this study, weused 30 reports as a development set and 90 re-ports as a test set.
In addition to the annotated de-velopment set, we used a separate set of 100 unan-notated ED reports to informally validate our termlists.Reference Standard.
A physician board-certifiedin internal medicine and infectious diseases with30 years of experience generated manual annota-tions for the development and test reports.
He usedGATE (http://gate.ac.uk/) to highlight every indi-84vidual annotation in the text referring to any of the55 clinical conditions.
For every annotation, heassigned values to the three contextual features, asshown in Figure 1.Previous experience in annotating the 55 condi-tions showed that a single physician was inade-quate for generating a reliable reference standard[19].
The main mistake made by a single physicianwas not marking a concept that existed in the text.We used NLP-assisted review to improve physi-cian annotations by comparing the single physi-cian?s annotations to those made by SySTR.
Thephysician reviewed disagreements and madechanges to his original annotations if he felt hisoriginal annotation was incorrect.
A study by Mey-stre and Haug [22] used a similar NLP-assistedreview methodology and showed that compared toa reference standard not using NLP-assisted re-view, their system had higher  recall and the sameprecision.Outcome Measures.
For each contextual featureassigned to an annotation, we compared ConText?svalue to the value assigned by the reference stan-dard.
We classified the feature as a true positive(TP) if ConText correctly changed the condition?sdefault value and a true negative (TN) if ConTextcorrectly left the default value.
We then calculatedrecall and precision using the following formulas:)(:RecallFNofnumberTPofnumberTPofnumber+)(:PrecisionFPofnumberTPofnumberTPofnumber+For the Temporality feature, we calculated recalland precision separately for the values historicaland hypothetical.
We calculated the 95% confi-dence intervals (CI) for all outcome measures.4 ResultsUsing NLP-assisted review, the reference standardphysician made several changes to his initial anno-tations.
He indexed an additional 82 clinical condi-tions and changed the title of the clinical conditionfor 48 conditions, resulting in a total of 1,620 in-dexed clinical conditions in the 90 test reports.
Thereference standard physician also made 35 changesto Temporality values and 4 changes to Negation.The majority of Temporality changes were fromhistorical to recent (17) and from hypothetical torecent (12).Table 3 shows ConText?s recall and precisionvalues compared to the reference standard annota-tions.
About half of the conditions were negated(773/1620).
Fewer conditions were historical(95/1620), hypothetical (40/1620), or experiencedby someone other than the patient (8/1620).
Inspite of low frequency for these contextual featurevalues, identifying them is critical to understandinga patient?s current state.
ConText performed beston Negation, with recall and precision above 97%.ConText performed well at assigning the Tempo-rality value hypothetical, but less well on the Tem-porality value historical.
Experiencer had a smallsample size, making results difficult to interpret.Table 3.

When the physician highlights text,GATE provides a drop-down menu to select theClinical Condition and the values of the Contex-tual Features.85We performed an informal error analysis, whichnot only isolates ConText?s errors but also pointsout future research directions in contextual featureidentification.5.1 NegationConText?s negation identification performed sub-stantially better than NegEx?s published results [9],even though ConText is very similar to NegEx anduses the same trigger terms.
Several possible ex-planations exist for this boost in performance.
First,our study evaluated negation identification in EDreports, whereas the referenced study on NegExapplied to discharge summaries.
Second, ConTextonly applied to 55 clinical conditions, rather thanthe large set of UMLS concepts in the NegExstudy.
Third, the conditions indexed by SySTR thatact as input to ConText are sometimes negated oraffirmed before ConText sees them.
For some con-ditions, SySTR addresses internal negation in aword (e.g., ?afebrile?
is classified as Fever with theNegation value negated).
Also, SySTR assignsNegation values to some conditions with numericvalues, such as negating Tachycardia from ?pulserate 75.?
Fourth, ConText does not use NegEx?soriginal scope of five words, but extends the scopeto the end of the sentence.
It would be useful tocompare ConText?s scope difference directlyagainst NegEx to determine which scope assign-ment works better, but our results suggest the in-creased scope may work well for ED reports.ConText?s errors in assigning the Negationvalue were equally distributed between FN?s andFP?s (23 errors each).
Some false negatives re-sulted from missing trigger terms (e.g., ?denying?
).Several false negatives resulted from the interac-tion between ConText and SySTR?s mapping rules.For example, in the sentence ?chest wall is withouttenderness,?
SySTR maps the UMLS concepts for?chest wall?
and ?tenderness?
to the conditionChest Wall Tenderness.
In such a case, the nega-tion trigger term ?without?
is caught between thetwo UMLS concepts.
Therefore, RE1 does notmatch, and ConText does not change the defaultfrom affirmed.
False positive negations resultedfrom our not integrating the rule described inNegEx that a concept preceded by a definite articleshould not be negated [23] (e.g., ?has not been onsteroids for his asthma?)
and from descriptions inthe text whose Negation status is even difficult forhumans to determine, such as ?no vomiting with-out having the cough?
and ?patient does not knowif she has a fever.
?5.2 TemporalityHistorical.
ConText identified historical condi-tions with 67% sensitivity and 74% precision.Identifying historical conditions appears simple onthe surface, but is a complex problem.
The singletrigger term ?history?
is used for many of the his-torical conditions, but the word ?history?
is a rela-tive term that can indicate a history of years (as in?history of COPD?)
or of only a few days (as in?ENT: No history of nasal congestion?).
The erroranalysis showed that ConText is missing triggerterms that act equivalently to the word ?history?such as ?in the past?
(?has not been on steroids inthe past for his asthma?)
and ?pre-existing?
(?pre-existing shortness of breath?
).Some conditions that the reference standardclassified as historical had no explicit trigger in thetext, as in the sentence ?When he sits up in bed, hedevelops pain in the chest.?
It may be useful toimplement rules involving verb tense for thesecases.The most difficult cases for ConText were thosewith temporal measurement triggers.
The few tem-poral quantifier patterns we used were fairly suc-cessful, but the test set contained multiple varia-tions on those quantifiers, and a new dataset wouldprobably introduce even more variations.
For in-stance, ConText falsely classified Non-pleuriticChest Pain as historical in ?awoken at approxi-mately 2:45 with chest pressure,?
because Con-Text?s temporal quantifiers do not account for timeof the day.
Also, even though ConText?s temporalquantifiers include the pattern ?last x weeks,?
xrepresents a digit and thus didn?t match the phrase?intermittent cough the last couple of weeks.
?We were hoping that identifying historical con-ditions would not require detailed modeling oftemporal information, but our results suggest oth-erwise.
We will explore the temporal categoriesderived by Hripcsak and Zhou [13] for dischargesummaries to expand ConText?s ability to identifytemporal measurement triggers.Hypothetical.
ConText demonstrated 83% recalland 94% precision when classifying a condition ashypothetical rather than recent.
Again, missingtrigger terms (e.g., ?returning?
and ?look out for?
)and termination terms (e.g., ?diagnosis?)
causederrors.
The chief cause of false negatives was ter-86minating the scope of a trigger term too early.
Forinstance, in the sentence ?She knows to return tothe ED if she has anginal type chest discomfortwhich was discussed with her, shortness of breath,and peripheral edema?
the scope of the trigger ?re-turn?
was terminated by ?her.?
The major limita-tion of regular expressions is evident in this exam-ple in which ?her?
is part of a relative clause modi-fying ?chest discomfort,?
not ?shortness of breath.
?5.3 ExperiencerConText?s ability to identify an experiencer otherthan the patient suffered from low prevalence.
Inthe test set of 90 reports, only 8 of the 1620 condi-tions were experienced by someone other than thepatient, and ConText missed half of them.
Two ofthe false negatives came from not including thetrigger term ?family history.?
A more difficult er-ror to address is recognizing that bronchitis is ex-perienced by someone other than the patient in?
?due to the type of bronchitis that is currentlybeing seen in the community.?
ConText made nofalse positive classifications for Experiencer.5.4 Limitations and Future WorkSome of ConText?s errors can be resolved by refin-ing the trigger and termination terms.
However,many of the erroneous classifications are due tocomplex syntax and semantics that cannot be han-dled by simple regular expressions.
Determiningthe scope of trigger terms in sentences with relativeclauses and coordinated conjunctions is especiallydifficult.
We believe ConText?s approach involv-ing trigger terms, scope, and termination terms isstill a reasonable model for this problem and hopeto improve ConText?s ability to identify scope withsyntactic information.A main limitation of our evaluation was the ref-erence standard, which was comprised of a singlephysician.
We used NLP-assisted review to in-crease the identification of clinical conditions anddecrease noise in his classifications.
It is possiblethat the NLP-assisted review biased the referencestandard toward ConText?s classifications, but themajority of changes made after NLP-assisted re-view involved indexing the clinical conditions,rather than changing the values of the contextualfeatures.
Moreover, most of the changes to contex-tual feature values involved a change in our anno-tation schema after the physician had completedhis first round of annotations.
Specifically, we al-lowed the physician to use the entire report to de-termine whether a condition was historical, whichcaused him to mark recent exacerbations of his-torical conditions as historical.
A second physicianis in the process of annotating the test set.
The twophysicians will come to consensus on their classi-fications in generating a new reference standard.How good contextual feature identification hasto be depends largely on the intended application.We tested SySTR?s ability to determine whetherthe 55 clinical conditions were acute, chronic, orabsent on a subset of 30 test reports [24].
SySTRmade 51 classification errors, 22 of which weredue to ConText?s mistakes.
In spite of the errors,SySTR demonstrated a kappa of 0.85 when com-pared to physician classifications, suggesting thatbecause of redundancy in clinical reports, Con-Text?s mistakes may not have a substantial adverseeffect on SySTR?s final output.5.5 ConclusionWe evaluated a regular-expression-based algorithmfor determining the status of three contextual fea-tures in ED reports and found that ConText per-formed very well at identifying negated conditions,fairly well at determining whether conditions werehypothetical or historical, and moderately well atdetermining whether a condition was experiencedby someone other than the patient.
ConText?s algo-rithm is based on the negation algorithm NegEx,which is a frequently applied negation algorithm inbiomedical informatics applications due to its sim-plicity, availability, and generalizability to variousNLP applications.
Simple algorithms for identify-ing contextual features of indexed conditions isimportant in medical language processing for im-proving the accuracy of information retrieval andextraction applications and for providing a baselinecomparison for more sophisticated algorithms.ConText accepts any indexed clinical conditions asinput and thus may be applicable to other NLP ap-plications.
We do not know how well ConText willperform on other report types, but see similar con-textual features in discharge summaries, progressnotes, and history and physical exams.
Currently,ConText only identifies three contextual features,but we hope to extend the algorithm to other fea-tures in the future, such as whether a condition ismentioned as a radiology finding or as a diagnosis(e.g., Pneumonia).87Over and above negation identification, whichcan be addressed by NegEx or other algorithms,ConText could be useful for a variety of NLP tasks,including flagging historical findings and eliminat-ing indexed conditions that are hypothetical orwere not experienced by the patient.
Ability tomodify indexed conditions based on their contex-tual features can potentially improve precision inbiosurveillance, real-time decision support, andinformation retrieval.Acknowledgments.
