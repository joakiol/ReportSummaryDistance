deAbst ractI describe a very simple HPSG analysisfor partial verb phrase fronting.
I will ar-gue that the presented account is moreadequate than others made during thepast years because it allows the descrip-tion of constituents in fronted positionswith their modifier emaining in the non-fronted part of the sentence.A problem with ill-formed signs that areadmitted by all HPSG accounts for par-tial verb phrase fronting known so farwill be explained and a solution will besuggested that uses the difference be-tween combinatoric relations of signs andtheir representation i word order do-mains.1 In t roduct ionDuring the last years, several different analy-ses for partial verb phrase fronting have beenproposed (Pollard, To appear; Nerbonne, 1994;Baker, 1994; Hinrichs and Nakazawa, 1994b).
Themost promising account so far has been the one ofHinrichs and Nakazawa.
This account, however,suffers from some drawbacks that will be discussedin section 4.
I will present a rather simple ac-count that, uses the standard NONLOC mechanismHPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) provides.
In sec-t, ion 3.3, I will discuss a problem that arises forall accounts of partial verb phrase fronting: un-derspecified COMPS lists.
By the means of a newdaughter (licensing daughter) in a schema for theintroduction of nonloeal dependencies this prob-lem will be solved.

'In a series of papers, Hinrichs and Nakazawa ar-gued for a special rule schema that combines theverbs of a so-called verbal complex before the ar-guments of the involved verbs are combined withthe verbal complex.
Because the verbal complex isbuild before any nonverbal argument of a verb getssaturated, it is possible to account for phenomenalike auxiliary flip.
As the verbal complex is an-alyzed as a constituent, the fi'onting of erz~ihlenmiissen in (lb) can be explained as well.
There isno problem with sentences like those in (1) for thestandard NONLOC mechanism.
Erziihlen miissenis a constituent in the non-fronted position in(2) and the same holds if the verbal complex isfronted.

Instead I will follow Reape's (1994)at)preach.
Reape assumes word order domains asan additional evel of representation.
In such adomain, all daughters of a head occur.
These do-mains differ from the daughter list, in that the el-e, ments in a domain (signs) correspond in theirserialization to the surface order of the words inthe string.
LP-eonstraints apply to elements ofthe order domain.
Another basic assumption ofReape is that constituents may be discontinuous.As Hinriehs and Nakazmva (1994a) have shown,it is reasonable to assume in addition to the headcomplement schema a schema that licenses the-verbal complex.
Hinri(:hs and Nakazawa intro-duced the concept of argument attraction into theHPSG framework.
If a vert)al (:omI)lex is build twoverbs are combined and the resulting sign inher~its all arguments from both verbs.
In their paper,Hinrichs and Nakazawa treat verbal complementsas ordinary complements hat, are included in theCOMPS list of their heads.
It has however proven1,o be useful to distinguish the verbal complementfrom other complements (Rentier, 1994a; Mfiller,1995a).
The merits of this move will t)e discussedshortly, l~br the Imrpose of representing the in-tbrmation at)out verbal colnt)lements , the fl;atureVCOMP is introduced.

It ismarked LEX+ because it can in turn be embedded.

'3.2 The  LEX FeatureThe LEX feature in the entry for werden ensuresthat a matrix verb is combined with its verbalcomplement before the verbal complement is sat-urated by one of its complements.
It is thereforepossible to avoid multiple structures in the Mit-telfeld.
(9) a. Er wird seiner Tochter ein M/irchen\[erzghlen mfissen\].b.
Er wird sciner Toehter \[\[ein M/irchenerz/ihlen\] miissen\]\].c.
Er wird \[\[seiner Tochter ein Miirchenerz//hlen\] miissen\]\].But exactly those constituents that have to beavoided in the Mittclfeld are needed in the Vor-reid.
Very complicate mechanisms have been in-troduced to cope with this problem without a lotof spurious ambiguities (Nerbonne, 1994; Hinrichsand Nakazawa, 1994b).
I will suggest a solutionto the problem that is very simple: If it is thecase that an embedded verb or verbal complex hasto be LEX+ when verb and complement are tom-bitted locally and if it is the case that this does nothold if a nonlocal dependency is involved than thesimplest solution is to view LEX not as a local fea-ture.
If one assumes that LEX lives under the pathSYNSEM instead of SYNSEMILOC than the problemturns into a non-issue.Figures 1 and 2 show the analyses of the sen-tences in (10).
4 In the analyses of (10a), a traceflmctions as a verbal complement.
In (10b) a tracefor a verb is modified by an adverb.
(10) a. Seiner Tochter erziihlen wird er dasM/irchen.b.
Vortragen wird er es morgen.Sentences like (5a) are ruled out because wirdselects a complement in bse-form that has aVCOMP value none.
As erziihlen does not appearin any COMPS list it is not possible for the verb tocount as an argument of the fronted verbal com-plex that is saturated in the Mittel\]eld.
This is thecase in Pollards account.
Hinrichs and Nakazawahave to block this case by stating type constraints4In the original grammar, I use a binary branchingschema for head-complement a d verb cluster struc-lures.
Adjuncts and complements are inserted intothe domain of their head so that word order facts areaccounted for.
Due to space limitations, the figuresshow a tree for a flat head-complement structure.on lists of attracted arguments.
With a separateVCOMP feature this problem disappears.3.3 The  Prob lem of  Underspee i f iedCOMPS ListsIn this section, I will address a problem that seemsto have gone unnoticed until now.
All analysesthat involve argument attraction admit signs withunderspecified COMPS lists.
So in (1), wird is coin-bined with a trace or a lexical rule is applied toit.
The LOC value of the verbal complement is putinto SLASII and the argmnents of the verbal com-plement are attracted by the matrix verb.
Thislist of argmnents, however, is not instantiatcd inthe resulting sign.
It remains variable until theSLASIt element becomes bound.
Therefore, theHPSG principles admit any kind of combinationof totally unrelated signs.
Since the COMPS list ofthe head is variable, any constituent is a possiblecomplement.
5 As an HPSG theory is assumed tobe a set of constraints that describe well formeddescriptions of linguistic objects, this is clearlynot wanted.
If a grammar contains phonologicallyempty elements (traces, relativizers, and the like)the set of ill-formed signs will be infinite becausewird -i could be combined with arbitrarily manyempty elements.
6It is clear that we want the matrix verb to be-have in a very well defined way.
It shall attractexactly the arguments of the fronted verbal pro-jection that were not saturated by this projection,i.e., the matrix verb shall perform the argmnentattraction that would take place in base position,abstracting away from tile value of LEX.
The de-sired effect can be reached if a rule schema is usedfor the introduction of nonlocal dependencies.
Tointrodnce a nonlocal dependency for a verbal com-plex, this schema requires an additional licensingcondition to be met.
The extracted element is li-censed by an actually existing verbal projectionin the string.
When a hearer of a sentence hearsthe words that have to be combined with a traceor introduce the nonlocal dependency in anotherway, he or she has already heard the phrase actu-ally located in the Vorfeld.
Therefore, the infor-Ination about the nonlocal dependency is presentand can be used to license the extracted element.The COMPS list of the extracted element, hereforeis specified.
The specified COMPS are attractedby tile matrix verb and the COMPS list of the ma-trix verb therefore does not contain any variablesand our theory does not admit signs that don'tdescribe linguistic objects.~The same problem exists for analysises that treatverb second as verb movement (Kiss and Wesche,1991; Netter, 1992).6For a bottom-up arser, this would mean non-termination.802S(lin\]V II.I';X-ILOC\[~ISUBJ <\[~,SUBCAT \[3\]<\[4\]>1\[~\]N P\[ilal\] V Ibse,LEX+,SUBJ <12~,SUI\]CA'I" <\[~ \[~,1IS?illcr Tiichter cr WdhlenSlfin,SI.ASII <Jil lV\[tin, \[~\]NP\[noml \[20NP\[acc\] \[i~V\[bse,I.EX-;,SUBCAT <\[~ ?

phrasal-signSchema 2 shows how this is implemented.
A ver-bal complement of a matrix verb is saturated.
TheVCOMP value of the resulting sign is none.
TheLOC value of the saturated verbal complement ismoved into SLASH.
This LOC value is licensed byanother verbal projection that meets the local re-quirements of the matrix verb but may be posi-tioned in the Vorfeld.
As there are no constraintsfor daughters to be adjacent o each other, theremay be an arbitrary munber of constituents be-tween the licensing daughter and the head daugh-ter.
The licensing daughter has licensing functiononly and is not inserted into the domain of theresulting sign (\[~) at this point of combination.However, an appropriate sign is inserted into thedomain of its head when the nonlocal dependencyis bound.4 A l te rnat ivesThe drawback of the approaches of Pollard (To ap-pear) and Nerbonne (1994) are discussed in (Hin-richs and Nakazawa, 1994b).
I will not repeatthe arguments against these approaches here.
In-stead, I will explain some of the problems of theHinrichs and Nakazawa pproach\]Hinrichs and Nakazawa changed the value ofSLASII into a set of signs rather than local objects.The fronted phrase is a maximal projection withthe missing constituents moved to SLASH.
Thefronted partial phrase is the filler for a nonlocaldependency which is introduced by their PVP-Topicalization Lexical Rule.
As SLASII elementsare signs, the lexical rule can refer to the SLASHset of a SLASlt element and it is thus possible toestablish a relation between the COMPS list of theauxiliary and the SLASH set of the fronted verbal7Due to space limitations, I cannot give a detaileddiscussion of their approach here.
The interestedreader is referred to (Mfiller, 1996).projection.
However, the assumption that SLASHcontains igns rather than local objects is a changeof the basic HPSG formalism with far reachingconsequences that is not really needed and thathas some side effects.In the following, I discuss two problems for thisapproach.
Firstly, it is not possible to account forcases where a modifier in the Mittelfeld modifiesthe fronted verbal projection without, assuming aninfinite lexicon because the only way for a mod-ifier to stay in the Mittelfeld while the modifiedconstituent is fronted is that the modifier is con-tained in the SLASIt set of the fronted constituent.It, therefore had to be a member of the COMPSlist.
An infinite lexicon is both not very nice froma conceptual point of view and an implementa-tional problem.
Without; a complex control strat-egy (late evaluation) it is not possible to imple-ment an infinite lexicon.
Another problem thatwas pointed out by Hinrichs and Nakazawa them-selves is sentences like (11).
(11) * Gewuflt, daft Peter - i  sehlggt, habeknown that Peter hit haveich siei.I her'I knew that Peter hit her.
'In (11), sic is extracted from the complement sen-tence of gewuflt and than inserted into the COMPSlist of babe and saturated in the Mittelfeld.
Thesame problem arises for other constructions in-volving nonlocal dependencies, s(12) a.
\[Da\]i hatte Karl \[- i  mit\] gerechnet.this had Karl with counted'Karl expected this.'b.
* \ [ \ [ - i  mit\] gerechnet \]hatte \[da\]i Karl.
(13) a. Bus/ will Kar l \ [ _ /  fahren\].bus wants Karl drive'Karl wants to go by bus.'b.
* \[ -i fahren\] will Karl bus/.5 Conc lus ionA very simple solution for the PVP problem wasfound.
A minor change in the feature geometryof signs was sufficient to cope with the spuriousambiguity problem of Pollard's (To appear) ac-count.
The account, argued for in this paper candescribe the fronting phenomena without the as-sumption of an infinite lexicon.
A solution for theproblem of underspecified COMPS lists was found.This solution makes use of a schema to introducethe nonlocal dependency.
An introduced nonlocaldependency is licensed by an actually present, el-ement in the syntax analysis of a string.
At; theSFor an analysis of stranded prepositions in termsof nonlocal dependencies see (Rentier, 1994b) and(Miiller, 1995@804point; of (:onlbination, this element plays a licens-ing role only and does not at)pear in the surfacestring of the buihl sign.
This is possible becausetwo different levels of representation forcombina-torial and order information are used.The analysis is part; of an implemented fragmentof German (Miiller, 1996).Re ferencesBaker.
