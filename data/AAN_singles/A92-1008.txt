Generating Spatial Descriptions forCross-modal ReferencesPeter  WazinskiSFB 314, Department of Computer ScienceUniversity of SaarbrfickenD-6600 Saarbrficken, Germanyemail: wazinski@cs.uni-sb.deAbstractWe present a localisation component that sup-ports the generation of cross-modal deictic ex-pressions in the knowledge-based presentationsystem WIP.
We deal with relative localisations(e.g., "The object to the left, of object X.
"),absolute localisations (e.g., "The object in theupl)er left part of the l)icture.")
and corner lo-calisations (e.g., "The object in the lower rightcorner of the l)icture").
In addition, we distin-guish two localisation granularities, one less de-tailed (e.g., "the object to the left.
of object X.
")and one more detailed (e.g., "the object aboveand to the left.
of object X.").
We consider cor-ner localisations to be similar to absolute local-isations and in turn absolute localisations to bespecialisations of relative localisations.
This al-lows us to compute all three localisation typeswith one generic localisation procedure.
Aselementary localisations are derived from pre-viously computed composite localisations, wecan cope with both localisation granularitiesin a computationally efficient way.
Based onthese l)rimary localisation l)rocedures, we dis-cuss how objects can be localised among severalother objects.
Finally we introduce group local-isations (e.g., "The object to left, of the groupof or, her objects.")
and show how to deal withthern.1 In t roduct ionThe increasing amount of information to be communi-cated to users of complex technical systems nowadaysmakes it necessary to find new ways to present infor-mation.
Neither the variety of all possible l)resentationsituations can be anticipated nor it is fiLrther adequateto present he required information in a single communi-cation mode, such as either text or graphics.
Therefore,the automatic generation of nmltimodal presentationstailored to the individual user has become necessary.Current research projects in artificial intelligence likeSAGE (\[Roth et al, 1990\]), FN/ANDD (\[Marks andReiter, 1990\]), COMET (\[Feiner and MeKeown, 1990\])and WIP (\[Wahlster el al., 1991a\]) reflect the growinginterest in this topic.For the knowledge-based presentation system WIP,the task is the generation of a multimodal document ac-cording to the formal description of the communicativeintent of the planned presentation and a set of generationparameters.
The current scenario for WIP is the gener-ation of instructions for using an espresso-machine.
Atypical fragment of an instruction manual for an espressomachine is shown in figure 1.bIA B C ??
?Before you lift the lidmake sure that theknob in the middle is inposition C.\o\ ??
?Remove the cover andpour in cold tap water.Figure 1: Fragment from an instruction manualCross-modal deictic expressions, e.g., "the lid" or "theknob in the middle," help to establish the coreferentialitybetween the entities mentioned in the text and shown inthe picture as well (\[Wahlster et al, 1991b\]).
The use o!spatial relationships uch as "the knob in the middle"simplifies the generation of referring expressions thathave to identify a particular object in a picture.
Ob-viously these spatial relationships cannot be computedin advance because they depend on the projection para-meters for the picture, e.g., the viewpoint, which in turnthemselves depend on the communicative intent of thedocument to be planned 1.The localisation component described in this paperwas developed in order to support the generation otcross-modal deietic referring expressions.
All proceduresare fully implemented and were recently integrated intcthe first WIP prototype.

A testbedcalled LOC-SYS was also developed: it allows the con-venient generation and manipulation of rectangle sceneslike the examples given in this paper.Before we describe the methods which underlie thevarious localisation procedures, in the following sectionwe present our views about localisation phenomena andintroduce the terminology used in the rest of this paper.2 Object LocalisationA lot of work has been done on 'object localisation'and its linguistic complelnent, 'spatial l)repositions'.Wunderlich/Herweg (\[Wunderlich, 1982\], \[Wunderlichand Herweg, forthcoming\]) and Herskovits (\[Herskovits,1985\]) provide linguistic approaches to the semantics ofspatial prepositions.
NL-systems like NAOS (\[Neumannand Novak, 1986\]), HAM-RPM (\[Hahn el al., 1980\]),SWYSS (\[HuBmann and Schefe, 1984\]) and C'ITYTOUR(\[Andr~ et al, 1985\],\[Andr~ et al, 1986\]) address var-ious issues regarding computational aspects.
Schirra(\[Schirra, to appear 1992\]) and Habel/Pribbenow (\[Ha-l)el and Pribbenow, 1988\],\[Pribbenow, 1990\]) also incor-porate relevant work from cognitive psychology.In our approach, we concentrate on the requirementsfor localising objects ill pictures.
We assume that theuser can see the picture containing the objects to belocalised and we do not deal with the problem of an-ticipating possibly wrong visualisations of the user inthe case he/she cannot see the picture.
We do not dealwith possible intrinsic orientations of depicted objects(c.f.
\[Retz-Schlnidt, 1988\]) and assume the deictic refer-ence frame of a common viewer (c.f.
figure 5).
Togetherwith every localisation, we compute a so-called applica-bility degree from the intervall \[0..1\].
The applicabilitydegree is not only used to generate linguistic hedges (c.f.\[Lakoff, 1972\]) as in SWYSS or CITYTOUR, but alsofor selecting the 'best' localisation from a set of alter-natives.
The localisations computed on our system aretwo-dimensional localisations in the sense that they arebased on the 2D-projection of a picture aim not on itspossible 3D-representation.
In the rest of this sectionwe will describe the localisation phenomena we take intoaccount and introduce our terminology.2.1 Re la t ive  and abso lu te  loeal isat ionsThe objects shown in part A of figure 2 can be localisedas follows:B%% jS S I I. IA?
RFigure 2: Localising objects in a picture(1) "Object A is on the right side of the picture.
"(2) "Object B is ill the lower part of the picture.
"(3) "Object A is to the right of Object B.
"(4) "Object B is below Object A.
"Sentences (1) and (2) are considered to contain ab-so lute  localisations: an object is localised by statingits absolute position in the picture.
Sentences (3) and(4) are examples of re la t ive  local isat ions:  an objectis localised by stating its position relative to another ob-ject.
The object to be located will be called the pr imaryob jec t  (LO for short).
The object that serves as refer-ence for locating the primary object is called re ferenceob jec t  (REFO for short).How can we explain the similarity between absoluteand relative localisations, between "on the right side ofthe picture" and "to the right of Object B"?
Our hy-1)othesis is:Absoh'lte localisations are specialisations ofrelative localisations in the sense that for ab-solute localisations the center of the picturefunctions as an implicit reference object.Part B of figure 2 shows how the absolute localisationof part A can be explained as a relative localisation byassuming a circle-shaped center: "Object A is on theright side of the picure."
is equivalent to "Object A isto the right of the center of the picture.
"2.2 E lementary  and  composite localisationsWhereas the unambiguous localisations of the objects infigure 2 could be achieved by naming either the horizon-tal ("on the right side", "to the right of") or verticalrelation ("in the lower part", "below"), figure 3 shows asituation in which it is necessary to give both the hori-zontal and vertical position of the object with respect othe reference object:5-1yz-qD\[qA, B,Figure 3: Elementary and composite localisationsIll part A of figure 3, it is sufficient o describe objectC as the object "to the right of" or "above" object A.But in part B, both descriptions would be ambiguous,because "to the right of" or "above" could refer to objectD or B respectively.
The only possibility to localise Cunambiguously is to describe it as being "above and tothe right" of A.Localisations where either the horizontal or verticalrelation is given will be called e lementary  local isa-t ions.
If both relations are stated together, we will callit a composite localisation.The localisation types introduced so far - -  absolute vs.relative and elementary vs. composite - -  are orthogonal.Therefore, an absolute or a relative localisation can befurther subcategorized as being all elementary or a corn-posite localisation.57(;omposite localisations cannot always he applied, e.g.,in figure 2 object B cannot be localised as "the objectin the lower left part of the picture."
Criteria for theapplicability of composite localisations will not he ex-alnined further in this paper as this would lead to morecomplex questions, e.g., whether an object can be lo-calised at all.
A detailed discussion of these prohlems isgiven in \[Wazinski, 1991\].2.3 The  const ruct ion  of  the  hor i zonta l  andver t ica l  re fe rence  f i 'alneOne important feature of the localisation l)roceduresis the division of the horizontal and vertical referenceframe into three parts.
The reason for this are 'center'-localisations as shown in figure 4:Figure 4: Center localisationsIn all pictures, object A can be localised as tile object"in the center of the 1)icture."
In order to integrate thisobservation with the elementary vs. composite distinc-tion we divided the horizontal and vertical dimensioninto three parts: 'top',  'horizontal center' and 'bottom'and 'left', 'vertical center' and 'top'  respectively (c.f.
fig-ure 5).
Under these conditions the 'center'-localisationin the left part of figure 4 can be analysed as a com-posite ('vertical center','horizontal center')-localisation.For the picture in the middle it is an elementary 'verti-cal center'-localisation a d for the right one an elemen-tary 'horizontal center'-localisation.
When transformingthese different localisations into a surface string they allbecome the same: "in the center of the picture.
"left vertical rightcentertophorizontalcenter"to the right of A" by assuming that the 'center'-part ofa composite localisation is a special part of a compositelocalisation that does not appear at the linguistic level.YlYlVFigure 6: Center localisations and relative localisations2.4 Corner  Loea l i sa t ionsAn additional ocalisation type that can be used to lo-calise objects in pictures is the corner  loca l isat ion:  ifan object is placed in one of the four corner regions ofthe picture it can be localised as, e.g., "the object in theleft upper corner of the picture.
"Tile difference between absolute composite localisa-tions and corner localisations is illustrated in figure 7:While object B can be localised as being "in the lowerright corner of the picture" it is not possible to use acorner localisation for A.
In that case, only "in the leftupper part of the picture" could be used.
Therefore, weconsider corner localisations to be more precise than ab-solute composite localisations, i.e., the applicability of acorner localisation implies the applicability of the cor-responding absolute composite localisation but not viceversa.AFigure 7: Corner localisations vs. absolute compositelocalisationsbottomFigure 5: Horizontal and vertical reference frameFigure 6 shows that it, is also useful to adopt thethis partition scheme for relative localisations: B wouldusually be described as the object "to the right of A"and C as the object "above and to the right of A.
"With respect to tile partition scheme a ('right', ' top')-localisation can be applied to C and a ('right', 'horizontalcenter')-localisation to B, The former matches exactlywith the surface string.
The latter can be matched with3 Bas ic  Loca l i sa t ion  P roceduresIn this section we present matrix-oriented localisationprocedures for absolute and relative localisations.
Asmentioned in section 2.2, both the horizontal and ver-tical relation of the primary object are given in case ofa composite localisation.
This suggests that compositelocalisations are composed of elementary localisations.The procedures presented here, though, behave differ-ently: for the sake of efficiency they compute the com-posite localisations first and derive the elementary lo-calisations from these previously computed localisationresults.583.1 Abso lu te  loea l i sat ionsWe approximate the center of the picture with a rect-angle whose horizontal and vertical extension is one thirdof the horizontal and vertical extension of the picture.Figure 8 shows the construction of the horizontal andvertical reference system according to the rectangularcenter region.vertical rightlell centerNtop.

((x-center, top), LO) = 1/6,A~((left, y-center), LO) = 1/4,Ac((X-center, y-center), LO) = 1/2.For all other 1 C CLOC we have A~(l, LO) = 0 becausef(P) = f(Po) = O.left verticalcenter righttop 1/3v4 ::Ni ::iii:i:---.-':!hor, onta, "::iiii NiicenterFigure 8: Tile construction of tile horizontal and verticalreference systemBefore describing the evaluation function for cornpos-ite localisations, we give a few definitions:?
The horizontal reference system is abbreviated byXLOC = {left, x-center, right}, the vertical one byYLOC ---- {top, y-center, bottom}.
Composite locali-sations are denoted by CLOC = XLOC ?YLOC.
Bothreference systems together are described with ULOC= XLOCI.JYLOC.?
The constant CENTER denotes the center rectangleof a given picture.?
POLY denotes the set of all polygons that can ap-pear in a picture.
For given polygons P1 andP2 tile associative and commutative operator N,("1 : POLY X POLY ~ POLY computes the in-tersection polygon.
The empty polygon is denotedby P0.
The following holds: VP E POLY : P$ 71 P =pnD~ = P~.?
The fimction PR (Partial Rectangle), PR : CLOC xPOLY ~ POLY ,  computes the rectangle correspond-ing to a given composite localisation and the rec-tangle partition of the picture induced by a givenpolygon.
For example PR((left,top), (:ENTER)computes the upper left rectangle according to thepartition scheme shown in figure 8.?
!R denotes the set of the real numbers.
Given apolygon P, the fimction f, f : POLY ~ N computesthe area of a polygon.
It is f(P~) = O.The applicability degree of a composite localisationevaluates how good the position of the object in ques-tion is described by that particular localisation.
We de-fine the applicability degree as the portion of the area ofthe object that lies in the rectangle of the picture thatcorresponds to the composite localisation and the rec-tangle partition of that picture.
Thus we can define A~as follows:Ac : CLOC X POLY ~ ,~A~(I, LO) = f (p )f (LO)with p = PR(I, CENTER) Cl LObosomFigure 9: Computing absolute localisationsFor elementary localisations we adopted an analogousdefinition: the applicability degree Ae of an elementarylocalisation is determined by the portion of the area ofthe object that lies in the corresponding row or columnof the picture.
As already mentioned at the beginningof this section we can write A~ in terms of A~ :A~ : XLOC :x: POLY ~A~(l,:, LO) : Z A~((l=, ly), LO)l vEYLOCAe y : YLOC ?
POLYA~e(ly, LO) = ~ A~((l~:, ly), LO)I=EXLOCAe : ULOC X POLY ~,fi ,'A~ and A~ compute tile applicability for the horizon-tal and vertical dimension by summing up the applicabil-ity degrees of the corresponding composite localisations.They are combined ill A?
order to have a function thatis defined oll both dimensions, i.e., ULOC.With respect o figure 9 we get:A~(top, LO) = A?
((left, top), LO) + A?
((x-center, top), LO) = 1/4,A~(y-center, LO) = A~((left, y-center), LO) +A?
((x-center, y-center), LO) = 3/4,A~(left, LO) = A?
((left, top), LO) + Ac((left,y-center), LO) : 1/:3 aimA~(x-center, LO) = A~((x-center, top), LO) +A~.
((x-center, y-center), LO) = 2/:3.59As argued in l)aragraph 2.4 corner localisationsare similar to composite (' left'/ 'r ight', top'/ 'bottorn')-localisations, but less general.
This property can bemodelled by corner regions that are smaller than timcorner regions for absolute localisations.
In turn, thesecorner regions correspond to a larger center as shown infigure 10.
Thus we can compute corner localisations justby changing the size of the center.FyFigure 10: Tim relation between corner and center re-gionsInstead of 1/3 as for absolute localisations we take 4/5of the horizontal and vertical extension of the picture forthe extended center.3.2 Relat ive  local isat ionsThe localisation procedure for relative localisations issimilar to the one for absolute localisations.
One ma-jor difference is that now the construction of the hori-zonta.l and vertical reference frame is done with respectto a given reference object and not to the implicit as-sumed center of the picture (c.f.
figure 11).
The seconddifference concerns the computation of the applicabilitydegree: for relative localisations, not only the portionof an area is taken into account, but also the distancebetween the primary object and the reference object.verticalleft center righttophorizontalcenterbottomFigure 11: The construction of the reference frame forrelative localisationsThe basic idea for the evaluation of the distance be-tween primary object and reference object is adoptedfrom the C,1TYTOUR system: first we compute the cen-ter of gravity for the primary object.
Then we determineits coordinates with respect to the reference system es-tablished by the reference object.
Finally we use thesecoordinates for the computation of the applicability de-gree.
Figure 12 illustrates the various factors that affectthe applicability of an 'above'-localisation:1.
The applicability degree decreases with an increas-ing vertical distance.
In Part A of figure 12 the ap-2..plicability degree for "P1 is above REFO" is greaterthan for "P2 is above REFO.
"The applicability degree decreases with an increas-ing horizontal distance.
In Part B the applicabilitydegree for "P3 is above REFO" is greater than for"P4 is above REFO.
"If the horizontal and vertical distances increase bythe same amount, then the applicability degree de-creases more with the increasing horizontal distancethan with the increasing vertical distance.
This isshown in Part C: the applicability degree for "P6is above REFO" is greater than for "P7 is aboveREFO", although the vertical distance between P5and P6 and the horizontal distance between P5 and/?7 are equal.P2?
P.6P1 e P3 P4 pe 5 P7A B. CFigure 12: Evaluating tile distance of a pointLet eval denote the function that evaluates the dis-tance between a point and a rectangle according to thecriteria mentioned above.
Let further POINT denote theset of all points within a picture and RECT C POLY theset of all rectangular polygons.
Then the signature oieval can be written as2:eval : CLOC ?
POINT ?
RECT ~ ~}~Now we are almost able to define the function Ac, whichcomputes the applicability degree of a composite lo-calisation.
Let CG,  CG : POLY  ~ POINT  , computethe center of gravity for a polygon and let further SR,SR : POLY  ~ RECT , compute the smallest surroundingrectangle for a polygon.
Then the applicability degreeAc of a composite localisation can be defined as:Ac : CLOC ?
POLY  X POLY  ~ {}~Ac( l, LO, REFO) = w eval( l, CG(p), SR(REFO))with p = PR(I, REFO) fq LOf(P)W - -  - -f (LO)2In reality eval is slightly more complicated because itmaps into ~' ?
~' and not only into 3.
The reason for this isthat the different evaluation of increasing vertical and hori-zontal distances can result in different evaluations for pointsto which both a horizontal or vertical ocalisation can be ap-plied.
E.g., P7 in figure 12 would get a different evaluation foJan 'above'- than for a 'right of'-localisation.
Therefore, thes~two values would be grouped to a tuple.
For the computatiorof an elementary localisation 1E XLOC we would sum up th~first component of the tuple.
If 1 E YLOC, we take the seconccomponent.
We abstract from this detail in order to mak~the principle of the procedure clearer.60p is tile part of the primary object that lies in therectangle corresponding to the composite localisation I.The factor w weighs the result of eval according to theportion of the area of the primary object that lies in therectangle corresponding to I.Now the definition of Ae, the applicability degree foran elementary localisation, can be given in terms of A~again:A~ : XLOC ?

A~(l, LO, REFO) if l E YLOCThis means that the applicability degree Ae for a pri-mary object LO is the sum of the coml)osite localisa-tions for tlle corresponding row or colunm of tile refer-ence  fr anle.For figure 1:3 we get, the following results:A~((x-center, top), LO, REFO)-5 -  l eval((x-center, top), P1, SR(REFO)__  1 - 5"0"7=0"23A~((right, top), LO, REFO)_ 2 eval((right, op), P2, SR(REFO) -52 = 5 * 0.65 = 0.43A?

((x-center, top), LO, REFO) = 0.234 A generic localisation procedure forabsolute and re la t ive  loca l i sa t ionsThe similarities between the localisation procedures dis-cussed in the previous section allow us to design onegeneric localisation procedure that can be specialised toa procedure for absolute, relative or corner localisations.Given the primary object, LO and the reference objectREFO the first step is to determine the 3 x 3 matrix M n,which contains the intersection polygons of LO and thepartial rectangles in the picture with respect o REFO.For relative localisations, REFO varies, for absolute lo-calisations and corner localisations the parameter is setto either the normal or the extended center area (c.f.section 3.1).
Thus, for x E XLOC, y E YLOC we computeM~v = PR((x,  y), REFO) M LOP2Pl\[-LO ?

The computation requires afimction E, E : POLY ?POLY ?POLY ~ ~.
E correspondsexactly to the flmction Ae for absolute and relative local-isations in section 3.1 and 3.2.
The only difference resultsfrom tile previous computation of Mn: tile subexpres-sion p = PR((x,  y), REFO) M LO is factored from A?
andtherefore computed only once.MAu = E(M2,u, LO, REFO)The third step is the computation of the elementary lo-calisations.
The vector )~ contains the evaluations of thehorizontal localisations and \]7 the ones for the verticallocalisations:yEYLOCxEXLOCThis means that we have -~t = Ae(l) for l E XLOC and= A~(l) for l E YLOC.Finally, we can determine the best composite and el-ementary localisation and their applicability degrees bycomputing the maximum value of M A and X or )7 re-spectively.For figure 13 we get0 0.23 0.43 )M A = 0 0 0 ,0 0 0~g = (0 0.2:3 o.43) and ~ = (0.66 0 0).
The best compos-ite localisation is "(right, top)" with applicability degree0.4:3.
The best elementary localisation is "top" with ap-plicability degree 0.66.5 Localising objects in a complex sceneIn the previous sections we considered pictures witha minimal number of objects.
In order to deal withmore complex object configurations the localisation pro-cedures presented above have to be extended.
Tile newtask is no longer "Localise LO with respect o REFO!
'"but "Given a set of REFO candidates, choose tile bestone for LO!
"61In order to reduce the search space for REFO candi-dates, f rst  a kind of 'between'-test i  applied to the setof possible reference objects.
The idea behind this testis that an exclusion procedure based on simple geomet-ric overlapping tests can be performed more efficientlythan a comparison of applicability degrees that have tobe computed by the rather complex localisation proce-dures.
An example is given in figure 14: When searchingfor a suitable reference object for object A in figure 14,object D would be ruled out because object B is foundin the 'between'-area of A and D./Jiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  " lI o IFigure 14: Search space reduction for complex objectconfigurationsThe deterinination of the best reference object raisesthe problem of ambiguity.
Not only is the applicabilitydegree of a localisation important, but also whether theuse of the reference object would result in an ambiguouslocalisation.
In that case, a different reference objecthas to be chosen.
If all possible localisations are am-biguous, then the particular object cannot be loealisedat.
all.
E.g., in Part A of figure 15 object D could belocalised as being either "above A" or "to the right of(:."
But the first localisation is ambiguous because both,C and D, are "above A."A.
B. C.Figure 15: Ambiguous reference objectsWith respect to elementary and composite localisa-tions we distinguish three cases of ambiguity:1.
In Part A of figure 15, the localisation of object (I orD would be ambiguous with respect o A because forboth objects the composite localisations, (x-center,top), are equal.2.
In Part B a composite localisation cannot be appliedto object D (neither "D is above and to the right ofA" nor "D is immediately above A" are adequate)and its elementary localisation, 'top',  is part of thecomposite localisation, (x-center, top), of object C.3.
In Part C a composite localisation can be appliedneither to C nor to D and their elementary locali-sations, 'top',  are equal.6 Localising Groups of ObjectsControl knobs and switches are often grouped togetherin a control panel in order to provide for easier operationof technical devices.
Moreover spatially adjacent objectscan also be grouped as one perceptual unit accordingto the 'law of the good gestalt' in Gestalt psychology(\[Murch and Woodworth, 1978\]).
Thus the possibilityto generate loealisations with respect to a given groupstructure is neccessary for the "naturalness" of a local-isation.
Besides this, group localisations are also usefulif the objects in the immediate neighbourhood of theprimary object have exactly the same properties (c.f.\[Wahlsterel al., 1978\]).
In th s case, the primary ob-ject can be localised with respect to its group and hasnot to be localised with respect o the whole scene, whichcould have resulted in an ambiguous localisation.For our localisation procedures this means that groupscan function as a reference object as well as a primaryobject..
In addition, objects can be localised absolutelywith respect o the group they are contained in.
In figure16 object B would be localised as the object "to the rightof the triangles."
Vice versa we can say "The trianglesto the left of object B" and we can localise object A asbeing "the upper left of the triangles that are to the leftof B.
"Figure 16: Group localisationsThe last example also illustrates the hierarchical char-acter of group localisations: An object can be localisecabsolutely within a group.
This group might be localisecagain within a surrounding roup or - -  if there is non(- -  this group can be localised relatively with respect t(another (group of) object(s).The algorithm for group localisations cannot deteclgroup hierarchies.
Instead it expects a tree representa-tion of tile group hierarchy as an input.
The output consists of two parts: According to the depth of the grouttree the algorithm computes a chain of absolute localisations.
In addition the outermost surrounding roup othe primary object is localised relatively to an optiona(group of) reference object(s).7 ConclusionsWe have introduced a unifying approach for absoluterelative and corner localisations of objects in pictures, haddition, the use of a special partition scheme for the reference frame of a preposition allows us to deal with tw,different localisation granularities for absolute and relatire localisations.
By defining the evaluation function62for elementary localisations in terms of the evaluationfimctions for the corresponding composite localisations,we have been able to design one procedure that handlesall three locMisation types and both localisation granu-larities efficiently.
Furthermore, we have given a solutionto the problem of localising an object within a complexconfiguration on the basis of this localisation procedure.Finally, we have shown how our system deals with grouplocalisations.References\[Andr(~ el al., 1985\] E. Andre, G. Bosch, G. Herzog, andT.
