Box 517Paoli, PA, 19301ABSTRACTLanguage understanding work at Paramax focuses on ap-plying general-purpose language understanding technologyto spoken language understanding, text understanding, anddocument processing, integrating language understandingwith speech recognition, knowledge-based information re-trieval and image understanding.1.
INTRODUCTIONThe basic language understanding technology in theParamax language understanding architecture has beendesigned to be both independent of the language inputinodality (e.g.
spoken input vs. scanned OCR input)as we\]\] as independent of the end application (e.g.
com-mand and control vs. data extraction).
This architec-ture is shown in Figure 1.I .

SPOKEN LANGUAGEUNDERSTANDINGThe focus of our spoken language understanding work isthe development of a domain- and application- indepen-dent dialog processing architecture which can be coupled*This paper was partially supported by DARPA contractN000014-89-C0171, administered by the Office of Naval Research,and by internal funding from Paramax Systems Corporation (for-merly Unisys Defense Systems).with a variety of speech recognizers.
Some of our recentachievements include:?
a non-monotonic reasoning capability, which willsupport "what if?"
exploratory dialogs?
a query paraphrase component o enhance user-friendliness?
enhanced reference resolution capabilities to sup-port additional types of context-dependent refer-ences?
automated training techniques for semanticsFigure 2 illustrates the integration of a speech recog-nizer, language understanding component, and a dialogmanager (VFE) into a modular spoken language archi-tecture interacting with the user and the application.

TEXT UNDERSTANDINGIn text understanding we emphasize an architecture inwhich a variety of components cooperate to produce459an analysis of texts.
Not all components may be re-quired for any one particular application - they can beintermixed in various ways to suit each application'sneeds.
This architecture, shown in Figure 3 includeskeyword-based information retrieval, for message rout-ing.
A knowledge-based information retrieval compo-nent (KBIRD) extracts text information which is ac-cessable without a detailed natural language analysis.If an application requires detailed natural anguage pro-cessing, a natural language processing system is avail-able.
Finally, a database record generator formats theextracted information for database generation.

DOCUMENT UNDERSTANDINGThe object of Paramax document understanding re-search is to develop novel knowledge-based approachesto the processing of document images.
Starting with thescanned image(s) of a document's pages, our goal is todetermine the document's functional and physical orga-nization and to extract he key ideas from the ASCII rep-resentation of its text.
Our current focus is on producingthe structural interpretation ofthe document and the ac-companying ASCII text for each component.
The ASCIItext would then be analyzed by a text-understandingsystem, as discussed in Section 2.An intelligent document understanding system is shownin Figure 4 with the scope of our project falling in theshaded region.This work is discussed in detail in \[3\].Re ferences1.
