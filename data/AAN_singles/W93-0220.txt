..On the text surface the transition from one communicative goal to another can, for in-stance, be observed from the text layout.
Where a new goal sets in, the p;i.ragral)h structureis often interrupted and a new paragraph begins.Also, the theme of the first sentence of such a new paragraph is in inost ca.ses not related toany element in the previous sentence, which is the case when subsequent sentences belongto the same communicative goal.
Instead, a new lexeme expressing the new global :\[bcusis usually preferred.The following text fragment exemplilies ome of the l)henomena identified above.Example  3: Topic Shift, Paragraph Structuring(..) As earlier, more than half of imported soft drinks came fi'om Austria, |ollowedby West Germany and Belgium/Luxembourg.Also e~.ports of mineral water contimted to expand rapidly.
(...)The two sentences given in Example 3 include a transition between two text segments whichfollow two different communicative goals.
As an effect, the paragraph topic changes from importto ezport, the new i)aragral)h introduces the new topic by placing it at thematic position and anew (surface) paragraph is created.The In teract ion  Between Communicat ive  Goa ls  and  Rhetor i ca l  Re la t ionsFrom what has been said above it can be concluded tha.t linguistic surface signals as discussedabove are ways to realize virtual constructs like rhetorical relations and communicative goals.This means that the interaction between communicative goals and rhetorical relations is oneof realization.
Rhetorical relations are employed to achieve communicative goals.
There arepossibly other ways of interaction between goals and relations, but they a.re difficult to observeand of rather speculative nature.
Therefore, we restricted the description of the interactionbetween goals and relations to what is observable.As pointed out in \[Maier and Hovy, '91\] three types of relations can be distinguished: ideational,interpersonal nd textual relations.
Descriptive texts can be characterized by the preferred useof ideational relations while interpersonal relations occur in genres with a high degree of readerinvolvement (advertisements, personal letters, etc.).
Textual relations are unspecific with respectto text types although sul)sets of the textual relations might be preferal)ly used for some genres(\[Maier '93\]).
Various types of communicative goals are responsible for the use of either ideationalor interpersonal relations - in \[Maier and Hovy, '91\] called "ideational" and "interpersonal"goals, respectively.
This labeling does not refer to the nature of the comnmnicative goals; itrather refers to the type of text to be generated and the type of relations to be used.
Instead,communicative goals have to be considered an interpersonal device, since they deal with theintentions to be achieved by means of the discourse.
In Systemic Functional Linguistics this isexactly what the interperson~d meta.filnction is about.The Representat ion  of  Rhetor i ca l  Re la t ions  and  Communicat ive  Goa lsBoth communicative goals a.nd rhetorical relations have been taxonomized and represented indeclarative knowledge resources (\[Paris and Maier, '91\]), which are part of the text planningsystem described in \[Hovy et al, '92\].
Both resources are implemented in a. way that the selection71of an item (a relation, a goal)results in the execution of associated realization statements,which achieve the effects discussed above (e.g.
topic shift, preselection of a subset of rhetoricalrelations,..).
In the following we discuss both knowledge resources in turn.The rhetorical relations are represented in a network, which is traversed uring text planningin order to find the best relation to connect the new proposition to the previous text.
Therealization statements specified for this relation are then executed.
Below we give an examplefor the representation of a relation.relation: id-sequenceinquiry: id-sequence-queryrealization: (SELECT-KNOWLEDGE sequence)(PREFER-THEMATIC-PRO GRESSION theme-theme)(GROW-TREE id-sequence)The selection of the relation ID-SEQUENCE, which is typically employed to link chronologicalevents, triggers three follow-up actions:?
an event is selected fi'om the knowledge base which stands in a succession relationship tothe event which has just been mentioned.
Also, relevant inibrmation linked to that "new"event (actors, temporal features) has to 1)e retrieved (SELECT-KNOWLEDGE);?
a certain pattern of thematic progresskm, which is th.vored by the relation at hand, isdetermined.
In example 2 above, the theme of the chronologically linked sentences i thesame ("water") throughout he whole text (function HtEFE a-Tll EM aTlC-PltO(~ rtESSlON);* the text plan is incremented by the new information and linked to the preceding contextby means of the relation ID-SEQUENCE (GROW-TREE).In a similar way, the effect of choosing a commuMcative goal imposes constraints on the docu-ment planning environment.
Depending on the type of goal, various realization statements areexecuted.
We distinguish (1) goals responsible for the generation ot' text segments and (2) goalscontributing to the choice of medium and presentation form of an utterance.
We will give anexample for each:communicative goal:type:realization:describe-group-topicsdescribe-group(PUSH-ON-GOAL-STACK -none-)(HIGHLIGHT-RELATIONS (elaborate-group elaborate-person))(CHANGE-TOPIC to-group)(PREFER-FOCUS (groul)))communicative-goal:type:realization:describe-by-showingdescribe(PREFER-PRESENTATION-TYPE picture)The goals related to the production of text, of which our first example is an instance, can inducethe following realization statements:?
if the text unit can be coml)osed of fiu'ther subtexts and if there are subgoals availahle torepresent these text units they have to be pushed on a goal stack in the order they aresupposed to appear in the text (PUSH-ON-GOAL-STACK).72* the relations which are typically used in the text units represented by the goal have to bemarked as preferable (HIGHLIGHT-RELATIONS).. with every change of the communicative goal, the global topic to be dealt with changesaccordingly.
This change in topic is brought about by the function CHANGE-TOPIC.
Interms of the text planning process this flmction determines the hub fl'om which the gen-eration of this new segment has to be started.
The hub represents the instance, wheretim knowledge selection and the navigation in the knowledge base with respect o the textunit starts.. where possible thematic progression is determined by means of rhetorical relations; if timcontext is empty and there is no relation available - for example when a new text unit isgenerated - or if thematic progression cannot be constrained by the relation chosen thedefault focus of the paragraph as specified by PREFER-FOCUS is taken.Goals concerned with the choice of the best way to l)resent intbrlnation activate only one .type of realization statements, which restrict the presentation types to be chosen (PR.EFErt-PRESENTATION-TYPE).Based on these ideas a new component for the treatment of communicative goals in the frame-work of Multimedia Document Generation has been developed.
This component integrates goalsnecessary for text planning with intentions ernployed by the so-called 'Pragmatic Model', whichflllfills the task of a presentation planner.
This builds on experience developed with the AlFrescoproject (\[Stock et al, forthcoming\]).References\[Hovy et al, '92\] E. Hovy, J. Lavid, E. Maier, V. Mittal and C. Paris.

AAAI press, forthcoming.73On Structure and IntentionMark T. Maybury*Abst rac tThis position paper contrasts rhetorical structuring of propositions with intentional decompositionusing communicative acts.
We discuss the kinds of information current explanation planners cap-ture in their plan operators and propose extensions to these.
In Maybury (1992b) we detail howthese plans can and have been extended to capture a more general notion of communication asaction, describing other types of communicative acts such as graphical acts and discourse acts.
Ourcurrent efforts (Maybury, 1992b, forthcoming) are focused on developing a taxonomy of multime-dia communication acts which attempt o distinguish semantic relations, rhetorical relations andintentions.Rhetor i ca l  S t ruc tur ing  versus In tent ion  Decompos i t ionA number of researchers have investigated using structural analyses of text, including RhetoricalStructure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson.
1987), as the basis for explanation planning archi-tectures.
For example, using rhetorical relations uch as background and elaboration, Hovy's (1988)system constructs a rhetorical structure over a given set of propositions (See Figure la).
Moore's(1989) system also constructs a rhetorical structure, however, the leafnodes of the resulting tree areillocutionary acts (e.g., inform) with associated propositions.
While we agree that text containsrelations between parts, we also concur with the position held by Suthers (1991) and others thatrhetorical relations, in their current form, conflate a number of issues including intention, structure,linear precedence, and epistemological distinctions.
Hovy (1990) details problems with R,ST ap-proaches to paragraph planning, including algorithnfic problems and, more seriously, problems withthe theory and representation f coherence relations.In contrast o RST-based planners but similar to rhetorical schema based generators, our explana-tion planning architecture uses "rhetorical predicates" (e.g., attribution, evidence, enablement) oabstractly characterize epistemological content and relations in tile underlying knowledge base.
Asin MeKeown (1982), some of these predicates indicate local relations (e.g., illustration) and have as-sociated cue words (e.g., "for example") or associated semantic actions (e.g., "contains," enables").Ilowever, other predicates, such as attribution or definitiou, have no marked relation to their sur-rounding text (only the weak notion of elaboration).
In our attempts to geuerate the range of textl.ypes ranging from narration to argumeut, we have found tile need to develop a correspondinglybroad range of rhetorical predicates, including logical-definition, synonymic-definition, constituency,cb~ssification, evidence, motivation, etc.
*Mail Stop K329, Artificial Intelligence Center, The MITRE Corporation, Burlington Road, Bedford, MA 01730.
(617) 271-7230. maybury@linus.mitre .org.74We use these same rhetorical predicates to abstractly mark the epistemological content of speechacts (e.g., request or inform).
All example action in our system might be II~FORX(#<systora>,#<usor-023>, logical-do:finition(#<ForrarJ.-Testarossa>)) which says "have tile system in-form user-023 of the logical definition of tile object, #<Ferrar:i .-Testarossa>," which might even-tuaily result in the utterance "A Ferrari Testarossa is a fast, sleek Italian sports car".
In order toretrieve the content for a "logical definition" predicate, we must not only look up the genus of theentity, but also calculate its differentia, or distinguishing characteristics (Maybury, 1990).
Thus, therelation between rhetorical predicates and semantic relations in the underlying knowledge base isnot a simple one-to-one mapping; in some cases the content must be calculated.
Moreover, contentmay be modulated by context or by a user model (e.g., choosing the perspective from which to viewan object., if it has multiple superordinates (McCoy, 1985)).Our architecture actually distinguishes between illocutionary acts (e.g., inform, request) and surfacespeech/locutionary acts (e.g., assert,, command, suggest) which have associated surface forms (e.g.,declarative imperative, interrogative mood).
In our architecture, the organization and structureof illocutionary speech acts such as the above inform action is accomplished by more abstractrhetorical acts (e.g., describe, compare, argue).
Rhetorical acts characterize the communicativeaction performed by one or more utterances, and correspond to the text types such as description,narration, and exposition.
Because our focus has been on formalizing the communicative actionsthat underlie texts, we have worked toward a unified view of rhetorical and speech acts.
Therefore,our approach can be seen as an extension of theoretical work which views language as purposefulbehavior (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969) and of computational implementations of speech acts (Cohen,1978; Allen, 1979; Appelt, 1982).
As we dicuss below, we have also investigated using the notio,of rhetorical acts to characterize both linguistic and non-linguistic acts, resulting, for example, inmixed text and graphics.We formalize conmlunicative acts (speech acts and rhetorical acts) ms plan operators.
A hierarchicalplanner easons about these operators in order to produce a text plan (an executable action decom-position) that achieves ome given discourse goal (see Figure l b).
The plamler actually produces twostructures: the action decoml)ositio, shown in Figure lb as well as a corresl)oudiug effect decolUl)O-sition in which each level represe.ts to the effects achieved by each act in the actio, dccompositio..In the architecture implemented in our system TEXPLAN, the decomposition of plan operatorscaptures the hierarchical structure and order of intentions underlying text.
Thus our architecturediffers from work in planned rhetorical relations (Hovy, 1988; Moore, 1989) in that it recog.izesand formalizes the distinction between the rhetorical relations in a text (e.g., evidence, enablcment,purpose) and the rhetorical acts establishing these.
And as we will discuss in a detailed positio.paper, there are also differences in the representation f preconditions and effects.Figure la.

Communicatiove-act-based.Communicative-Act-I/ \speech-act-1 Communicative-Act-2/ \speech-act-2 speech-act-3ConclusionIn our research we have found that there are at least four generic types of text: description, nar-ration, exposition, and argument.
These text types form the basis of explanations which conveydifferent propositional content (e.g., entities and relations versus events and states), have particu-lar intended effects on the addressee's knowledge, beliefs, and desires, and are compositional (e.g.,narration can invoke description).
In the extended position paper wc contrast two architecturesfor explanation planning: rhetorical structuring of propositions versus comnmnicative act-based ex-planation planning.
In our work we consider the structure of plan operators, including issues ofconstraints, preconditions, effects, and decomposition, and have discussed (Maybury, 1992b) howcurrent representations might be extended, and also consider the applicability to plan inultimediaexldanations and discourse.
After considering issues concerning plans and focus models, we concludehy indicating that current plan-based architectures suffer from a number of fundamental rchitec-tural deficiencies that stem froln the current state of the art in planning techniques.
This situation isexacerbated by the current lack of understanding of the nature of and relationshiip among attention,intensions and rhetorical relations.ReferencesAllen, J. F. 1979.
