Thismakes the deep processing of honorificinformation crucial in various computa-tional applications such as spoken lan-guage translation and generation.
Weargue that, contrary to the previous lit-erature, an adequate analysis of Ko-rean honorification involves a systemthat has access not only to morpho-syntax but to semantics and pragmaticsas well.
Along these lines, we have de-veloped a typed feature structure gram-mar of Korean (based on the frame-work of HPSG), and implemented itin the Linguistic Knowledge BuilderSystem (LKB).
The results of parsingour experimental test suites show thatour grammar provides us with enrichedgrammatical information that can leadto the development of a robust dialoguesystem for the language.1 Basic Properties of HonorificAgreementHonorification, one of the main features of spokenlanguage in Korean, plays a key role in proper andsuccessful verbal communication (Chang 1996,Lee 1998, Sohn 1999).
The Korean honorific sys-tem basically requires that when the subject is inthe honorific form (usually with the marker -nim),the predicate also be inflected with the honorificform -(u)si as in (1):1(1) a. sensayng-nim-i wus-usi-ess-e.teacher-HON-NOM laugh-HON-PST-DECL?The teacher laughed.
?b.#sensayng-nim-i wus-ess-e.This type of agreement is often assumed to bepurely pragmatic, mainly because certain contextsallow disagreeing cases between the subject andthe verb: the utterance of (1)b can be felicitouswhen the speaker does not honor the referent ofthe subject (marked by #).
The possibility of hav-ing such disagreement has often to an assumptionin the literature that using the -nim and -si formof verbs is a matter of gradience and appropriate-ness rather than grammaticality (cf.
Chang 1996,Pollard and Sag 1994, Lee 1998).However, one often neglected fact is that thisagreement constraint must be observed when thesubject is non-human as in (2) (cf.
Sohn 1999):(2) a. cha-ka o-(*si)-ess-e.cha-NOM come-HON-PST-DECL?The car came.?b.
kwukhoy-ka pepan-ul simuy-ha-(*si)-ess-e.congress bill review-HON-PST-DECL?The congress reviewed the bill.
?If we rely only on pragmatic information, wewould have difficulty understanding why, in con-trast to the disagreement in (1)b, disagreementlike that in (2) are rarely found in real languageusages.1Abbreviations we use in the paper include ARG(ARGUMENT), ACC (Accusative), BAKGR (BACK-GROUND), COMP (Complementizer), CTXT (CON-TEXT), DECL (Declarative), HON (Honorific), IMPER(Imperative), NOM (Nominative), ORTH (ORTHOGRA-PHY), PST (Past), SYN (SYNTAX), SEM (SEMANTICS),RELS (RELATIONS), and POS (part of speech).97In addition, there exist agreement-sensitivesyntactic phenomena such as auxiliary verb con-structions:(3) a. sensayng-nim-i nolay-lulteacher-HON-NOM song-ACCpwulu-si-ci anh-(usi)-ess-e.sing-HON-COMP not-HON-PST-DECL?The teacher did not sing a song.?b.
sensayng-nim-i ton-ul mo-(*si)-eteacher-NOM money-ACC save-HON-COMPtwu-si-ess-e.hold-HON-PST-DECL?The teacher saved money (for rainy days).?c.
sensayng-nim-i nolay-lulteacher-HON-NOM song-ACCpwulu-si-na po-(*si)-e.sing-HON-COMP seem-HON-DECL?The teacher seems to sing a song.
?As noted here, even though the subject is hon-ored in each case, the honorific marker on themain predicate in (3)a is optional with the aux-iliary anh- ?not?
; in (3)b the marker must appearonly on the auxiliary verb twu- ?hold?
; meanwhilein (3)c the marker cannot appear on the auxiliarypo ?seem?.
Such clear contrasts, we can hardlyattribute to pragmatic factors.22 Honorification in a Typed FeatureStructure GrammarA closer look at the honorific phenomena of thelanguage in the previous section suggests that anadequate theory of honorification aiming for inte-gration into a proper communication system re-quires not just complex pragmatic informationbut also morpho-syntactic information.
The ba-sic framework of the grammar we adopt for mod-elling the language is the type-feature structuregrammar of HPSG.
HPSG seeks to model humanlanguages as systems of constraints on typed fea-ture structures.
In particular, the grammar adoptsthe mechanism of a type hierarchy in which ev-ery linguistic sign is typed with appropriate con-straints and hierarchically organized.
This systemthen allows us to express cross-classifying gen-eralizations about linguistic entities such as lex-emes, stems, words, and phrases in the language(cf.
Kim and Yang 2004, Kim 2004).2In addition to this subject-verb agreement, the languageemploys addressee agreement marked on a verbal suffix de-pending on the honoring relationship between speaker andaddressee.
Such agreement, though implemented in ourgrammar, is not presented here because of space limit here.2.1 Lexicon and Subject AgreementOur grammar, named KPSG (Korean PhraseStructure Grammar), first assumes that a nominalwith -nim and a verbal with -si bear the head fea-ture specification [HON +].
This is supported bythe contrast in the following:(4) a.
[[haksayng-i manna-n] sensayng-nim-i]student-NOM meet-MOD teacher-HON-NOMo-si-ess-e.come-HON-PST-DECL?The teacher that the student met came.?b.
[[sensayng-nim-i manna-si-n]teacher-NOM-NOM meet-HON-MODhaksayng-i] o-(*si)-ess-e.student-NOM come-HON-PST-DECL?The student that the teacher met came.
?As seen here, it is the honorific information on thehead noun sensayng-nim in (4)a that agrees withthat of the verb.With this head feature information, the gram-mar builds the honorific nominal type (n-hon)from the basic lexeme (n-lxm) as represented inthe following feature structures:3(5) a.?????????????

?n-honORTH ?sensayng-nim ?
?teacher-HON?SYN |HEAD[POS nounHON +]SEM 2??????
?As seen in (5)a, a nominal lexeme with no hon-orific marker -nim is underspecified for the HONfeature.4Meanwhile, the subject of an honorific verbalelement carries the feature [HON +] in additionto the relevant pragmatic information:3The information our grammar encodes for such lexemeentries is only the shaded part: all the other information isinherited from its supertypes defined in the grammar.
Fora more comprehensive system of morphology built withinsuch a system, see Kim (2004) and Kim and Yang (2004).4The boxed number here is used as a way of showing thatsemantic value of the lexeme, n-lxm is identical with that ofthe honorific noun n-hon.98(6)a.?????????

?The basic verbal lexeme type v-lxm in (6)a doesnot carry any restriction on its subject.
However,as given in (6)b, the v-hon type with the -(u)si suf-fix adds the information that its subject (the firstelement in the ARG-ST (argument structure)) is[HON +], in addition to the information that thespeaker is honoring the subject referent as givenin the CTXT value.One of the key points in this system is that eventhough the [HON +] verb selects a [HON +] sub-ject, the subject of a nonhonorific verb can be ei-ther in the honorific or nonhonorific form since itsvalue is underspecified with respect to the verb.This then correctly allows disagreeing exampleslike (1)b where the subject is [HON +] and theverb?s HON value is ?boolean?
:(7) sensayng-nim-i wuc-ess-e. ?The teacher laughed.
?The nonhonorific verb combines with the hon-orific subject with no honoring intention from thespeaker since the nonhonorific verb does not bearthe pragmatic constraint that the speaker honorsthe referent of the subject.Yet the grammar blocks disagreeing cases like(2) where an honorific verb combines a non-honorific subject:(2) a.
*cha-ka o-si-ess-ta.
?The car came.?b.
*kwukhoy-ka ku pepan-ul simuy-ha-si-ess-e.?The congress reviewed the bill.
?These are simply not parsed since the honorificverb here would combine with the [HON ?]
sub-ject, violating the constraint in (6)b.
A nounlike sensayng ?teacher?
is [HON boolean], whilesensayng-nim is [HON +], and most nouns are[HON ?
].2.2 Object and Oblique AgreementWhile subject honorification has a productive suf-fixal expression, there are some lexically sup-pletive forms like poyp-e ?see.HON-DECL?
andmosi-e ?take.HON-DECL?, which require theirobject to be in the honorific form:(8) a.
*John-i Mary-lul poyp-ess-e.John-NOM Mary-ACC see.HON-PST-DECL?John honorably saw Mary.?b.
John-i sensayng-nim-ul poyp-ess-e.John-NOM teacher-HON-ACC?John honorably saw the teacher.
?Our grammar lexically specifies that these supple-tive verbs require the object to be [HON +] to-gether with the pragmatic honoring relation.
Thefollowing is the lexical information that a supple-tive verb like this accumulates from the inheri-tance hierarchy:(9) ????????????????

?PRED honoringARG1 iARG2 j??????????????????????
?Such lexical information can easily block exam-ples like (8)a where the object is [HON ?
].Lexically suppletive forms like tuli-e?give.HON-DECL?
and yeccup-e ?ask.HON-DECL?
require their oblique argument to be inthe HON form (nonhonorific forms are cwu-eand mwut-e, respectively):(10) a. John-i sensayng-nim-eykey senmwul-ulJohn-NOM teacher-HON-DAT present-ACCtuli-ess-e.give.HON-PST-DECL?John gave the present to the teacher.?b.
*John-i haksayng-eykey senmwul-ul tuli-ess-e.Just like object agreement, our grammar assignsthe HON restriction on its dative argument to-gether with the pragmatic honoring constraint:99(11) ????????????
?v-lxmSYN |HEAD |HON +ARG-ST?

?PRED honoringARG1 iARG2 k???????????????
?Once again the grammar rules out examples like(10)b in which the dative argument haksayng-eykey ?student-DAT?
is nonhonorific.
How-ever, nothing blocks the grammar from gener-ating examples like (12) where the dative argu-ment sensayng-nim-eykey ?teacher-HON-DAT?
is[HON +] even if the verb cwu- ?give?
is in thenonhonorific (unspecified) form:(12) John-i sensayng-nim-eykey senmwul-ul cwu-ess-e.2.3 Multiple HonorificationGiven this system, we can easily predict that itis possible to have multiple honorific examplesin which subject agreement cooccurs with objectagreement:(13) ape-nim-i sensayng-nim-ulfather-HON-NOM teacher-HON-ACCpoyp-(usi)-ess-e.HON.see-HON-PST-DECL?The father saw the teacher.
?The honorific suffix -si on the verb here requiresthe subject to be [HON +] whereas the supple-tive verb stem asks its object to be [HON +].
Insuch examples, the honorific marker in the verbcan be optional or the verb can even be replacedby the nonsuppletive form po- ?seem?.
However,the grammar does not generate cases like the fol-lowing:(14) a.
*John-i sensayng-nim-ulJohn-NOM teacher-HON-ACCpoyp-usi-ess-e.HON.see-HON-PST-DECL?John saw the teacher.?b.
*ape-nim-i John-ulHON.see-HON-PST-DECLpoyp-ess-e.HON.see-HON-PST-DECL?The father saw John.?
(14)a is ruled out since the HON form -(u)si re-quires the subject to be [HON +] whereas (14)b isruled out since the suppletive form poyp- selectsa [HON +] object.We also can see that oblique agreement can oc-cur together with subject agreement:(15) a. eme-nim-i sensayng-nim-eykeymother-HON-NOM teacher-HON-DATsenmwul-ul tuli-si-ess-e.present-ACC give.HON-PST-DECL?Mother gave the teacher a present.b.#eme-nim-i sensayng-nim-eykey senmwul-ultuli-ess-e.c.#eme-nim-i sensayng-nim-eykey senmwul-ulcwu-(si)-ess-e.d.
*John-i sensayng-nim-eykey senmwul-ul tuli-si-ess-e.e.
*eme-nim-i John-eykey senmwul-ul tuli-si-ess-e.Since the nonhonorific verb places no restrictionon the subject, the grammar allows the disagree-ment in (15)b and c. However, (15)d and (15)ecannot be generated: the former violates subjectagreement and the latter violates object agree-ment.2.4 Agreement in Auxiliary ConstructionsThe present honorification system in the KPSGcan offer us a streamlined way of explainingthe agreement in auxiliary verb constructions wenoted in section 1.1.
Basically there are threetypes of auxiliaries with respect to agreement (seeSells 1998):Type I: In the construction with auxiliary verbslike anh- ?not?, when the subject is in the hon-orific form, the honorific suffix -si can optionallyappear either on the preceding main verb or on theauxiliary verb or on both:(16) a. sensayng-nim-i o-si-citeacher-NOM come-HON-COMPanh-usi-ess-e.not.HON-PST-DECL?The teacher did not come.?b.
sensayng-nim-i o-si-ci anh-ess-e.c.
sensayng-nim-i o-ci anh-usi-ess-e.d.#sensayng-nim-i o-ci anh-ess-e .Type II: When the head auxiliary verb is onelike po- ?try?, twu- ?hold?, and ci- ?become?, sub-ject honorification occurs only on the auxiliaryverb.
That is, the preceding main verb with thespecific COMP suffix form -a/e cannot have thehonorific suffix -si:(17) a.
*sensayng-nim-i John-ul cap-usi-eteacher-NOM John-ACC catch-HON-COMPtwu-si-ess-e.do.for.the.future?The teacher hold John for future.?b.
sensayng-nim-i John-ul cap-a twu-si-ess-e.c.
*sensayng-nim-i John-ul cap-usi-e twu-ass-e.d.
sensayng-nim-i John-ul cap-a twu-ass-e.100Type III: Unlike Type II, auxiliary verbs likepo- ?see?
and kath- ?seem?
cannot have the hon-orific suffix -si even if the subject is in the hon-orific form:(18) a.
*sensayng-nim-i chayk-ul ilk-usi-nateacher-NOM book-ACC read-HON-COMPpo-si-ta.seem-DECL?The teacher seems to read a book.?b.
sensayng-nim-i chayk-ul ilk-usi-na po-ta.c.#sensayng-nim-i chayk-ul ilk-na po-ta.d.
*sensayng-nim-i chayk-ul ilk-usi-na po-si-ta.First, the agreement in Type I simply followsfrom the general assumption that this kind of aux-iliary verbs acts like a raising verb whose subjectis identical with that of the main verb:(19) a.

?The negative auxiliary verb with or without the-(u)si suffix selects as its arguments a subject anda lexical complement whose subject is identicalwith the auxiliary?s subject.
This means when ei-ther one of the verbs requires an HON subject,then the combination of the main verb as a com-plex predicate will also require an HON subject.5The absence of the HON on the main verb forthe Type II AUX is due to the language?s mor-phological constraints.
Such an auxiliary verbforms a verbal complex together with a mainverb that bears the COMP suffix -a/e: this suf-fix morphologically requires its verb stem to haveno honorific -(u)si (cf.
Kim and Yang 2004).This morphological constraint can be attested bythe fact that suppletive honorific form with no5This treatment assumes that the auxiliary verb combineswith the preceding (main or auxiliary) verb and forms a com-plex predicate.
See Kim and Yang (2004) for this line oftreatment.productively-formed -si marking can occur in theType II construction:6(20) a. sensayng-nim-i sakwa-lul tusi-eteacher-NOM apple-ACC HON.eat-COMPpo-si-ess-e.try-HON-PST-DECL?The teacher tried to eat the apple.?b.

?Within the grammar we developed where eachspecific verb stem has its own type constraint, thestem value of the COMP suffix -a/e must be a verblexeme with no suffix -si.As for the Type III AUX, the grammar needsto rely on semantics: AUX verbs like po- ?seem?and kath- ?seem?

?The honoring relation applies not to a propositionbut to a human individual: it is such a seman-tic property that places a restriction on the HONvalue of the auxiliary verb.3 Testing the Feasibility of the AnalysisIn testing the performance and feasibility of thegrammar, we implemented our grammar in theLKB (Linguistic Knowledge Building) system(cf.
Copestake 2002).
The test suites we used con-sist of the SERI Test Suites ?97 (Sung and Jang1997), the Sejong Corpus, and sentences fromthe literature on honorification.
The SERI TestSuites (Sung and Jang 1997), designed to evalu-ate the performance of Korean syntactic parsers,6The verb in Korean cannot be an independent wordwithout inflectional suffixes.
The suffixes cannot be attachedarbitrarily to a stem or word, but need to observe a regularfixed order.
Reflecting this, the verbal morphology has tra-ditionally been assumed to be templatic:(i) V-base + (Passive/Causative) + (HON) + (TENSE)+ MOOD101consists of total 472 sentences (292 test sentencesrepresenting the core phenomena of the languageand 180 sentences representing different types ofpredicate).
Meanwhile, the Sejong Corpus has179,082 sentences with about 2 million words.We randomly selected 200 simple sentences (theaverage number of words in each sentence isabout 5) from the corpus.
These sentences areclassified according to their honorification types(agreement target ?
predicate) and the ratio ofparsed sentences:7(22) (target) # of # Parsed(predicate) Sentences SentencesnonHON (tgt)?
514 (76.4%) 455 (88.5%)nonHON (pred)HON (tgt)?
64 (9.5%) 58 (90%)HON (pred)HON (tgt)?
90 (13.3%) 82 (91%)nonHON (pred)nonHON (tgt)?
4 (0.05%) 0 (0%)HON (pred)Total 672 595 (88.5%)In addition to these sentences, we selected 100sentences (including the ones given in the paper)from the literature on Korean honorification: 51sentences with -si marked verbs, 31 with auxiliaryverb constructions, and 18 with suppletive verbforms.
We obtained similar results: the grammarparsed a total of 96 sentences.Among the total of 691 parsed sentences, wechecked the meaning representations (minimal re-cursion semantics: MRS) and the pragmatic rep-resentations of 100 randomly selected sentences,and could see that the representations contain thecorrect information that the grammar is designedfor.
We believe that the enriched deep process-ing of grammatical honorific information that thegrammar successfully composed in the parsingprocess can well function for the proper under-standing of natural data.4 ConclusionHonorification, one of the most salient features ofthe language, involves various grammatical levels7The four nonHON ?
HON sentences are cases wherethe nominals are not in the honorific form.
One way to ac-cept such examples is to remove the [HON +] restriction onthe object of such verbs while keeping the pragmatic honor-ing relationship between the subject and object.of information: morphology, syntax, semantics,and pragmatics.
It is thus necessary for a parserto have not only shallow but also deep process-ing of the honorific information, so that we cancheck that a given sentence is felicitous.
Suchdeep processing is a prerequisite to the success ofdialogue processing, zero pronominal/anaphoricresolution, and so forth.The grammatical architecture we adopt is atyped feature structure grammar, couched uponHPSG, that allows us to handle morpho-syntactic,semantic, and also pragmatic information.
Theimplementation of this grammar in the LKB sys-tem proves that a type-feature structure grammarcan provide us with a proper deep processingmechanism for Korean honorification that opensdoors for promising applications in such areas asmachine translation and dialogue systems.ReferencesChang, Suk-Jin.
