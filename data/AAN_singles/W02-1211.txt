R. Chinalesun, bradxue, qwm, wxf, yfsun@sonata.iscas.ac.cnAbstractThis paper describes the constructing of alarge-scale (above 500,000 pair sentences)Chinese-English parallel corpus.
The currentstatus of Chinese corpora is overviewed withthe emphasis on parallel corpus.
The XMLcoding principles for Chinese?Englishparallel corpus are discussed.
The sentencealignment algorithm used in this project isdescribed with a computer-aided checkingprocessing.
Finally, we show the design ofthe concordance of the parallel corpus andthe prospect to further development.IntroductionWith the development of the corpus linguistics,more and more language resources have beenestablished and used in language engineeringresearch and applications.
As we all know, thereare different kinds of corpora for different kindsapplications.
For example, the ChinesePart-Of-Speech annotation corpus used to trainprogram for Chinese word segmentation andPOS tag, the Chinese tree bank used to Chinesesyntax study, and so on.In this paper the constructing of a large-scaleChinese-English parallel corpus, which is totallyabove 500,000 pair sentences and the first yeartask is 100,000 pair sentences, is described.
Theapplications of the large-scale Chinese-Englishparallel corpus put emphasis on the sentencetemplate extracting for EBMT (Example-BasedMachine Translation) and translation modeltraining for SBMT (Statistical-Based MachineTranslation).
The latent applications may includethe bilingual lexicon extraction, special term orphase extraction, bilingual teaching,Chinese-English contrastive study, etc.Numerous corpus data gathering efforts exit allof the world.
The rapid multiplication of suchefforts has made it critical to create a set ofstandards for encoding corpora.
CES (CorpusEncoding Standard), which is conformant to theTEI Guideline for Electronic Text Encoding andInterchange of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI2002), has been adopted by many corpus-basedwork.
The XML Corpus Encoding Standard(XCES) is a part of the Guideline developed bythe Expert Advisory Group on LanguageEngineering Standards (Ide, N., Bonhomme, P.,Romary, L. 2000).
The coding of ourChinese-English Parallel Corpus is in broadagreement with the TEI Guideline for electronictexts.In the following section, we first present a briefreview of the current status of Chinese corporawith the emphasis on parallel corpus.
Then theXML coding principles for Chinese?Englishparallel corpus are discussed in detail.
Followingthis is the sentence alignment algorithm used inthis project with a computer-aided checkingprocessing.
Finally, we show the design of theconcordance of the parallel corpus and theprospect to further development.1 Chinese Corpus Project OverviewThe Chinese Corpus constructing work started in1920?s, See Zhiwei Feng (2001).
Themachine-readable corpora established in 1980?sare listed as following: Chinese Modern Literature Corpus(1979), 5.27 Million ChineseCharacters, WuHan University; Modern Chinese Corpus (1983), 20Million Chinese Characters, BeijingUniversity of Aeronautics andAstronautics; Middle School Chinese BookCorpus (1983), 1.06 Million ChineseCharacters, Beijing Normal University; Modern Chinese Word FrequencyCorpus (1983), 1.82 million Chinesecharacters, Beijing Language &Culture University.The first national large-scale Chinese corpusproject is proposed in 1991 by State LanguageCommission in China.
The Chinese texts used inthis corpus are selected carefully under thecondition of times, genre, and field.
Now thecorpus is about 20 million Chinese characters.From 1992, there are several large-scale Chinesecorpus constructed by different institutes.
Themost noticeable in them is the Chinese POSannotation corpus accomplished by Institute ofComputational Linguistics, Peking University,with the cooperation with Fujitsu Company.
Thecontent of this corpus is people?s daily, one ofthe most popular newspapers in China.
TheChinese texts are segmented and added POS tagwith high precision.
The total ChineseCharacters are about 27 million.There are several Chinese corpora in TsinghuaUniversity also.
The corpus, which is used forChinese segmentation study, includes 100million Chinese characters.
The Hua Yu corpus(2 million Chinese characters) is a POS taggedfield-balance corpus.
And the 10 percent of thiscorpus has been used for constructing Chinesetree bank.These are also other valuable Chinese corporaestablished in ShanXi University, Harbintechnical University, ShangHai NormalUniversity, City University of Hong Kong,Taiwan Academia Sinica, University ofPennsylvania and so on.
Please refer to ZhiweiFeng (2001) for detail.In October 2001, a national corpus project, thatis, national 863 project about ChineseInformation Processing Platform, is launched.It?s a cooperation project between five institutesin China, including Institute of Software,Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute ofComputational Linguistics, Peking University,Tsinghua University, Nanjing University andInstitute of Language, State LanguageCommission.
The content of corpora andintended scale in this project are showed in table1 in detail.
The large-scale Chinese-Englishparallel corpus described in this paper is one ofthe scheming corpora in this project.The multilingual corpus is important forcomputational linguistics research andcontrastive linguistics study.
So there are manymultilingual corpus have been established orbeing developed in many institutes in Chinamainland.
The table 2 shows theChinese-English parallel corpus had beenconstructed in Mainland China.
There are alsosome bilingual corpora about other language pair,such as Chinese-Japanese, Chinese-German, etc.Sub-Project Name Responsible Institute First-Year  ScaleSchemingScaleChinese Balance Corpus State Language Commission 70 MCC 150 MCCChinese-English Parallel Corpus  IOS, Chinese Academy of Science 100 TS 500 TSChinese POS Annotation Corpus ICL, Peking University 7 MCC 30 MCCChinese Tree Bank Tsinghua University 15 TS 60 TSChinese Concept Dictionary ICL, Peking University 20 TC 60 TCChinese Semantic Knowledge Base Tsinghua University 8 TW 24TWTable 1 The 863 Chinese corpus projectMCC: Million Chinese Character       TS: Thousand SentenceTC: Thousand Concept                 TW: Thousand WordInstitute  Corpus DescribingScaleICL, Peking University Sentence & Phrase Alignment 5 TSHarbin Institute of Technology  Sentence, Phrase, Word Alignment Above 5 TSState Language Commission Computer Science and Plato UnknownBeijing Foreign Studies University Literary, Science and Civilization inChinaUnknownNortheastern University Sentence & Phrase Alignment UnknownIOS, Chinese Academy of Science Sentence Alignment  8 TSTable 2 The Chinese-English parallel corpus in MainlandIt has been noticed by many scholars that weshould build a principle for sharing languageresource in research work and to avoid the wastein time and effort in repeated construction.2 Resource CollectionUnlike single linguistic resource, the parallelresource for special language pair is limited nomatter what language pair is.
Although theChinese and English both are most popularlanguage in the world, we still encounter muchdifficult in obtaining parallel corpus resourcefrom Internet for following reasons:There are seldom web pages in Chinaprovide the same content in Englishpages and in Chinese pages;The English news in web are translatedfreely other than literally with manycontent omission;Some bilingual texts are restricted andused only to member.After two years efforts, there are totally about16,000KB untagged Chinese-English paralleltexts in hand.
The genres of the resource wecollected are showed in table 3.Chinese Genre About PercentNews 10%Literature 30%GovernmentReport 25%Sciences &Technology 35%Table 3 The genre in parallel texts3 Coding3.1 General PrinciplesThe coding of the parallel corpus is in broadagreement with the TEI Guideline for electronictexts.
The eXtendible Make-up Language (XML)is used for the text coding.
Textual features aremarked by tags enclosed within angle brackets.For example, a title is marked by start tag <title>and an end tag </title >.
Every element has someattributes to identifier of the element.The document type definition (DTD) for thetexts in the corpus may differs in some respectsfrom the TEI model.
The general principle forcoding are based on following consideration:Comply with TEI guide lines on thewhole;Define the tag with clear meaning usedby most people in china;Only used the attributes which can beeasily and automatically get from sourcetexts, except the alignment link, which isthe key attribute in this corpus andseveral steps are used to keep highprecise (See section 4 for detail);Try to keep all the interim resource inhand in case information loses, such as,the title tag in HTML files.The overall structure of a Chinese-EnglishParallel corpus is shown by this example:<article id=?UH001?><Header type =?Unix Handbook?></Header><text></text></article>There are two main parts in a text: a header andthe main text.
Every text has an unique identifierthat is, article id, in this case UH001 (indicatingtext 001 of the Unix Handbook)3.2 The headerEach text is described by a header, which hasfour parts in accordance with the TEI guidelines:a file description, an encoding description, aprofile description, and a revision description.The file description gives bibliographicalinformation on the source text.
The elementsinclude title, author, www address (If the text isobtain from Internet), etc.
The encodingdescription in our corpus is very brief, only theproject name and the DTD file name are listed.The country or region use the language isindicated in the profile description.
Thedescription under <language> used in our corpusis in terms of labels like: Mainland Chinese(MaC), Hong Kong Chinese (HKC), TaiwanChinese (TwC), Singapore Chinese (SiC),American English (AmE), British English (BrE),Canadian English (CaE), etc.Another tag used in the profile description is<textclass>.
According to the parallel resourcein hand, the texts are grouped into 4 genres (asshow in table 3), such as, News , Literature,Science & Technical?Government Report.A series of changes are listed in the revisedescription and specified the change, the date ofthe change, the person responsible for thechange, and the nature of the change.3.3 Text Units and Alignment UnitThe corpus texts are segmented according to thenatural units, such as: chapter, paragraph,sentence (S-unit), and word.
The English wordsare simply marked by spacing as in ordinarywritten text.
The Chinese words are notindicated by space in order to avoid the segmenterror.An ID is given to every paragraph to indicate therelative position in whole chapter.
The sentenceis called S-unit, the same as Johansson, Ebelingand Oksefjell (1999) to underline that they arenot necessarily sentences in a grammatical sense.The sentence alignment type between ChineseS-unit and English S-unit maybe 1:1, 2:1, 3:1,1:2, 1:3,2:2, 3:2, 2:3.
Links between paralleltexts are showed by attributes of S-Alignment.One of the Chinese alignment unit (it maybeyond one S-unit) are linked with thecorrespondence English alignment unit.3.4 Sample TextA sample text of our Chinese-English parallelcorpus is showed in figure 1.Figure1 Sample Text4 Sentence Alignment4.1 Algorithm OverviewThe key attribute in this corpus is alignment link,which connect the one or more Chinese sentencewith one or more correspond English sentence.In order to keep high precise in sentencealignment, several steps are used with the humanand computer cooperation.The first step to extract structural information forparallel corpus is paragraph alignment andsentence alignment, that is noting whichparagraph and sentence in one languagecorrespond to which paragraph and sentence inanother language.This problem has been studied by manyresearchers and a number of quite encouragingresults have been reported.
However, almost allbilingual corpora used in research are clear(nearly without sentence omission or insertion)and literal translation bilingual texts.
Theperformance tends to deteriorate significantlywhen these approaches are applied to noisycomplex corpora (with sentence omission orinsertion, less literal translation).There are basically three kinds of approaches onsentence alignment: the length-based approach(Gale & Church 1991 and Brown et al 1991),the lexical approach (key & Roscheisen 1993),and the combination of them (Chen 1993, Wu1994 and Langlais 1998, etc.
).The first published algorithms for aligningsentences in parallel texts are length-basedapproach proposed by Gale & Church (1991)and Brow et al(1991).
Based on the observationthat short sentences tend to be translated as shortsentences and long sentences as long sentences,they calculate the most likely sentencecorrespondences as a function of the relativelength of the candidates.
The basic approach ofBrow et al is similar to Gale and Church, butworks by comparing sentence length in wordsrather than characters.
While the idea is simple,the models can still be quite effective when usedto clear and literal translated corpora.
Once thealgorithm had accidentally mis-aligned a pairsentence, it tends to be unable to correct itselfand get back on track before the end of theparagraph.
Use alone, length-based alignmentalgorithms are therefore neither very robust norreliable.Kay & Roscheisen (1993) use a partialalignment of lexical items induce a maximumlikelihood at sentence level.
The method isreliable but time consuming.Chen (1993) combines the length-basedapproach and lexicon-based approach together.A translation model is used to estimate the costof a certain alignment, and the best alignment isfound by using dynamic programming as thelength-based method.
The method is robust, fastenough to be practical and more accurate thanprevious methods.The first sentence alignment model used to alignEnglish-Chinese bilingual texts is proposed byWu (1994).
For lack of cognates inEnglish-Chinese, he used lexical cues to add therobust of his model.All of these works are test on nearly clear andliteral translation bilingual corpora.There are seldom papers related to paragraphalignment.
It's believed by most of theresearchers that the paragraph alignment is aneasier task than sentence alignment.
Gale &Church (1991) suggest that the samelength-based algorithm can be used to alignparagraph also.4.2 The Alignment StepsSentence alignment algorithm of our system canbe outlined as follows:Step 1: Align sentence by the improvedlength-based algorithm.
(Desicibed in Sunetc.
1999)Step 2: A lexicon checking process is added tojudge all the alignment results in step 1.A score is given to every alignment pair(A Chinese word segmentation system isused in this process to find Chineseword).Step 3: The alignments whose score above athreshold C1 are judged as correctalignment.
Remove these correctalignments from bilingual texts temporally.Step 4: The rest parts are aligned again by lengthbased approach.Step 5: Repeat step 2, the score of everylignment is showed as a reference to humanchecking.4.3 Computer-Aided CheckingIt's obviously difficult to increase greatly theaccuracy and robust of sentence alignment only bylength based approach.
So a lexicon checkingprocess is added to our system.
The alignmentresults obtained by length based approach arechecked by an English-Chinese lexicon.
A score SAis given to every alignment sentence pair.
Thescore SA is calculated by following idea, that is,the twice number of correctly matched Englishwords and Chinese words to the sum of numberof English and Chinese words.
In figure 2, theinterface for human checking is showed in orderto processes the noise Chinese-English parallelresource.4.4 Experiment ResultsWe tested our alignment algorithm with part of acomputer handbook (Sco Unix handbook).
Thereare about 4681 English sentences and 4430Chinese sentences in this computer handbookafter filter noisy figures and tables.
The detailexperiment result of automatic sentencealignment is show in table 4.

Besides a listingof the keywords with the contexts in which theyappear, the correspondence translation sentencealso be presented in this tool.
The options mayinclude bilingual concordances, sorting in avariety of orders, and producing basic textstatistics.
The intended interface is showed infigure 3.Figure 3 The Interface for bilingual Concordance6 Conclusion & Further ProspectsIn this paper, we introduce the developing project,that is, the constructing of a large-scale (above500,000 pair sentences) Chinese-English parallelcorpus.
The current status of Chinese corpora isoverviewed with the emphasis on parallel corpus.The XML coding principles for Chinese?Englishparallel corpus are discussed.
The sentencealignment algorithm used in this project isdescribed with a computer-aided checkingprocessing in order to processes the noiseChinese-English parallel resource.. We show thedesign of the bilingual concordance for theparallel corpus, also.As a beginning project, there is still much roomfor further development.
The parallel resource isrelative rare, so the new ways, such as, dataexchange with other researcher institute andtranslation company, should be launched toobtain more parallel resource which can be usedto research society.
The coding principle shouldbe adjusted in real work.
A coding rule in moredetail should form in near future.
We also intendto add the option for recommendation thecorrespondence translation word for inputkeywords in concordance tool.AcknowledgementsThis work is supported by China 863 project(Grant No.
