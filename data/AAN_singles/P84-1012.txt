Toward a Redefinit ion of Yea/No QuestionsJulia HirschbergDepartment of Computer and Information ScienceMoore School/D0University of PennsylvaniaPhiladelphia, PA 19104ABSTRACTWhile both theoretical and empirical studies of question-answering have revealed the inadequacy of traditional definitionsof Ve*-no quest ions (YNQs), little progress has been madetoward a more satisfactory redefinition.
This paper reviews thelimitations of several proposed revisions.
It proposes a newdefinition of YNQs baaed upon research on a type ofconversat ional  irnpIieature, termed here setdarimp/ ie , , tu re ,  that helps define appropriate responses to YNQs.By representing YNQs as sealer qtteriee it is possible to supporta wider variety of system anti user responses in a principled way.I INTRODUCTIONIf natural language interfaces to question-answering systems areto support a broad range of responses to user queries, the waythese systems represent queries for response retrieval should bereexamined.
Theorists of question-answering commonly definequestions in terms of the set of all their possible \[true) answers.Traditionally, they have defined t/us-no quesgiofts (YNQs) asproposit ional quest ions (?P) or as a special type ofalternat ive quest ion (?P V ?Q), in which the second alternativeis simply the negation of the fir.~t (?P V ?"P).
So 'Does Mary likeskiing?'
would be represented as flikr(lffary,skling) or?like(Alary.okiing) V "~-Iikt(Mary, skiing) and the range ofappropriate responses wouhl be gee, no and, possibly, unknown.? "
ilowever, both theoretleal wnrk and empirical studies of naturallyoccurring question-answer xchanges have shown this approach tobe inadequate: ?~s, .o.
and unknown form only a small portion ofthe set ?,f all appropriate responses to a YNQ.
Furthermore, forsome YNQ's.
none of these simple direct responses alone i~appropri:,te.While it is widely recognized (llobbs, 1979, Pollack, 1982} thatindirect resp.nses I to YNQs represent an important option forrespondents in natural discourse, standard theories of question-answering have n,~t been revised accordiugly.
A practicalCOllsPquence surface~ when attempts are made t.o support indirectresponses to YNQs computationally.
For lack of alternativerepresentations, question-answering systems which would permitindirect responses must still represent YNQs as if the directrespons-s were the 'norm', and then resort to ad hoe manipulationsto generate second-class 'indirect' responses, thus perpetuating anasymmetric distinction between 'direct' and 'indirect' responses.However.

'h under way on how a type of generalizedconversat ional  implieatttre, termed here scalarirrtplieature, can be used to guide the generation andiaterpretion of indirect respt,nses to YNQs sugges/,s a revi~edrepresentation fi)r YNQs which scrotums)dates a wide variety ofresponses in a uniform way.II CURRENT REPRESENTATIONS OF  YNQ, SAmong st:~ad:,rd accounts of ?NQs, I-lintikka's (l.lh:tik.~a, 197~)is one of the shnl)lest and mo~t widely accepted, c~.,mbinh~g thellndirect r~sponses to YNQs tr~ defined h~:re as responses other than l l tR,n0, or some expression of ignorance.concepts of YNQ" as pn,positional question " and as alternativequestion; as such, it will be used below to represent raditionalapproaches in general.
To define attswerhood, the conditionsunder which a response onnts as an answer to a natural-languagequery, Hintikka divides qneriq~s into two parts: an imperative oroptaGve operator {\[).
roughly expressing 'bri,g it about that', anda daesideratu~,n, a specification of the epistemie state a questhmerdesires.
For Hintikka, a YNQ is a ~peciai case of alterna(Jvequestion in which the negative alternative 'or not P' has beensuppressed.
So the desideratum of a YNQ is of the f?~rm (\[ knowthai P) V {I kin, u, that #t~3+P}.
where net-l- indicates thenegation-fi)rming process.
'Does Mary like skiing?'
thus has a.s itsdesideratum I know that ,~htrg li\];e.* skiing or I kno~ ihat Aiarydoes not like skiing, or, more concisely, fK~Jike{Marg, skling) VKs~likc{'Marll, ekiing), where K S is the epistemic representatitm of'S knows that'.
The full sense of the query is then 'Bring it abootthat 1 know that Mary likes skiing or that I know that Mary doesnot like skiing', which can be represented by !
\[KsP V K.~',P).Possible resp.nses are simply {P,-,P}, or {yes,no).A.
t I _~othes ls  Conf i rmat ionBolingcr (Boliuger, 1978) has called such interpretations intoquestion by showing that YNQs may have very different meaningsfrom their alternatlve-questioa counterparts; they also have morerestricted paraphrase and intonation patterns.
In 13oliuger's viewthe term I/US-no qtterl/ has hypnolized scholars into a.ssurrlingthat, simply because a class of question can be answered by a 2usor no, the~ altern:ttives are critcrial, and every YNQ is intendedto elicit, one or the other.
He proposes instead that YNQs beviewed as hypotheses put forward for confirmation, arncadmenL ordiseonfirnladon - in any degree.
Thus, in Bolinger's exampie (l),the(1) Q: Do you like llonolnlu?R: Just a little.questioner (Q)'s hypothesis 'you like tloaoh, iu' is amended by ~herespondent (R) in a re.-ponse v, hich is neither .t, es n,~r no bntsomewhere in between.
In his example (2), Q's hypothesis 'it is(2) Q: Is it difficult?R: It's imposeS'de.difficult' is confirmed by R's as,ertion of a more positive resi~onsethan a simple go.

For example, (Sa) is not  afocussed YNQ while {Y~bHY, d ) are.

'; and ifshe asks (Sd) she may want to know 'Who is leaving for Stockhohntomorrow?"
Titus a f,~cussed YNQ resemhles the wh-question thatmight be formed by replacing the focussed element in thedesideratum with a corresponding Pro-element.
In Kiefer'sanalysis, only one eh't~ent can he focussed, so resl~mses such as'l ie's leaving for Paris Thursday' will not be accommodated.Although Kiefer does not propose a representation for focugsedYNQs, a di..:j,nc!
resembling the desideratum of a wh-questionmight I,e added to the traditional representation to areommodatehis third :tlterna|ive: for (5d} this might take the form 'Is Johnleaving for Stoekhohn tomorrow, or, if not, who is?'
or, inHintikka's notation,!
KQleaving(.Iohn,Stockholm,tomorrow) VKq- leav  ing{.Ioh n,Stoek h-Ira,tomorrow) V3x Kqleav ing(x,Stoek holm,tomorrow).This represenl.atiou reflects another problem posed by Kiefer'sanalysis: the third disjunet is appropriate only when the secondalso is and not when the direct response ~les is true.
For example,a response of 'Bill is' to (Sd) seems to convey that John h notleaving for Stockhoha tomorrow.
Thus viewing some YNQs aswh*qm,,qions req.ires a rather more coml~lex representation thansimply adding a wh-question as a third disjunct.
* In addition,defining different representations for various YNQ subtypes eemsa le~s than satisfactory solution to tbe linfitations presented bycurrent representations of YNQs.
A more unified solution to theproblems identified by Bolinger and Kiefer would clearly bedesirable.
Such a solution is suggested by current research on therole conversational implieature plays in accounting for indirectre.~pons~s to YN~.~)s.I I I  CONVERSATIONAL I 'MPL ICATURE AND YNQSIn a large cl:~s of in,!irect respon:~e.~ to YNQs, query andresponse ach refi, r to an entity, attribute, state, activity, or eventthat can bo viewed as appearing on sorae eea~e; such references"In f~et, the third di~jon~t would have to be something like~ KQ-~leaving(Jol, n,~3oekholm,to~,~,~rrou,} A tea~ingfz.Sterkl~olm,tomorrow).aThe idea.~ outlined in the following section are discussed in more detail in(tlir,~rhberg, 1984).will be termed scalars and responses in such exchanges will betermed scalar responnes ,   In such scalar exchanges, questionerscan infer both a direct response and additional implicit informationflora the unreqm'sted information provided by the respondent.
In{0) for example, Q is entitled to infer the direct response no or Idon "~ know(6) Q: Are mushrooms poisonous?R: Some are.and the additional information that It believes that there may bemushrooms that are not  poisonous, ew, n though 3z(rnashroom(z)A poism~ous(x)) does not IogicMly i-,{v an)" of this information.Clearly 'Some are' is an appropriate r,.~pouse to the query - moreappropriate in fact than a simple no, wllich might convey that.
nomushrooms are poisonous - but what makes it appropriate?Grire's (Grice, 1975) Cooperative Principle claims that, withoutcontrary evide~cp, participants in convers~.tion assume theirpartners are trying to be cooperative.
In consequence, theyrecognize certain conversational maxims, such as Grice's Mnzirn.of Quantit|lu I Make your eoutribution as informative as isrequired (for the current purposes of the exchange).b) Do not make your contribution more informativethan is required.and his ~,~azint o l  QuoJ i tyTry to make your contribution one that is true.a) Do not say what you believe to be false.b) Do not.
say that for which you I~k  adequateevidence.Speaker and hearer's mutual recognition of these maxims may giverise to eort~erscttional ~mp~ieaturen :  An utteranceeonveraatios~allll intp~icates a proposition P when it conveysP by virtue of the bearer's assumption of the speaker'scooperativeness.
While s speaker may not always obey the~emaxims, the hearer's expectations are based on her belief that suchconventions represent he norm.A.
Scalar Pred|eat lonFollowing Grice, Horn {flora, 1972) observed that, when aspeaker refers to a value on some scale defined by eentantl,"enta i |ment  4, that value represents the highest value on its scalethe speaker can t ruthful!y affirm.
The speaker is saying as much{Quantity) as she truthfully (Quality) can.
Higher values on thatscale are thus implicitly marked by the speaker as not known tobe the case or known not  to be the ease.
5 Values lower on thescale will of course be marked as true, since they are entailed.Horn called this phenomenon sca lar  predleat ion,  andGazdar {Gazdar, 1979) later used a variation as the basis for aphenomenon he termed sea /a t  quant i ty  irrtp\[ieature.
Here amuch revi~d and extended version will be termed scalarimpl leature.Horn's simple notion of scalar predication does provide aprincipled ba.~is for interpreting ({3) attd similar indirect responsesto YNQs where scales are defined by entailment.
Some is thehighest value on a quantifier scale that R can truthfully affirm.Truth?values of higher scalars such as all are either unknown to Ror believed by him to be false.
Thus, if Q recognizes R'simplieature, roughly, 'As far as 1 know, not all mushrooms arepoisonous', she will derive the direct response to her query as no orI don ~ know.
H must believe either that some mushrooms are notpoisonous or that some mushrooms may not  be poisonous.4W semantieMly entails Tiff T is true whenever W is.5Whether x speaker implicates ignorance or falsity of ?
value is t subject of~ome disagreement ?merit Ilorn and those (Gasdar, lg7g, So~mes, 1082) whoh?ve taken up his basic notion, In (ltirschberg, 1984) I contend that suchimplieatures should be viewed as didunctions, K(~T) V ~K(T), which may bedbamhiguated bythe nature of the ordering relation or by the context.49d?It is also important o note that, in (6), were R simply to denyQ's query or to assert ignora~ce with a simple \[ don't know, Qwould be entitled, by virtue of the Cooperative Principle, toassume that there is no scalar value whose truth R can in factaffirm.
That is, Q can assume that, as far as R knows, there areno mushrooms that are poisonous, for otherwise R could commithimself to the proposition that 'some mushrooms are poisonous'.More generally then, 1-~ is obliged by the Cooperative Principle,and more especially by Joshi's (Josh}, 1982) modification of Grice'sMaxim e l  Qua/ i t l / :  'Do not say anything which may imply forthe hearer something which you the speaker believe to be false.
', toprovide an indirect response in (6), lest a simple direct responseentitle Q to conclude some , fa/ ,e iwtplieaturee.
Thus indirectresponses must  be included among the set of all appropriateresponses to a given YNQ, since in some cases they may be themost  appropriate response R can make.B.
Sca lar  Imp l l ca tureWhile scalar predication provides a principled explanation for {6),a revised and extended notion of aea /ar  irrtplieature canaccount for a much larger class of indirect responses to YNQs.
Itcan also suggest a revised representation f YNQs in general basedupon this enlarged class of appropriate responses.Order}ors not defined by entai lment and order}rigs other thanlinear orderings, including but not limited to set/set-member,whole/part, process stages, spatial relationship, prerequisiteorderings, ent i ty/attr ibute,  lea hierarchy, or temporal ordering,permit the conveyance of scalar implicatures in much the sameway that the entailed quantifer scale does in (6)~ In (7) the set /member(7) Q: Did you invite the Reagans!R: I invited Nancy.
(8~ Q: }lave you finished the manuscript?It: I've started a rough draft.relati,,nship orders the Rcagans and Nancy; R implicates that hehas not  invited Ronald, for instance.
In 18), starting a roughdraft precedes finishing a manuecript in the process of preparinga paper.
So Q is entitled to conclude that R has not  finished themanuscript or completed any later stage in this process, such asfinishing the rough draft.More formally, any set of referents {bl,...,bn} that can bepart ial ly ordered by a relation O s can support scalarimplicature.
Any scale S that permits scalar implicature can berepresented as a partiallg-ordered eet.
For any referents bt ,  b zon S, b 2 is higher on S than b I iff b lOb2;  similarly, b I is loweron S than b~ iff b lOb  ~.
Any pair b 1, b~ of ineontparableelements (elements not ordered with respect to one another byO) will be termed alternate values with respect to S. Thisredefinition of scale accommodates order}ors such as thosementioned above, while excluding orderings uch as cycles, that donot permit scalar implieatute.
It also helps define the inferenceslicensed when \[t affirms a higher or an alternate value, or when hedenies or asserts ignorance of lower, higher, or alternate valses.For example, R affirms a higher scalar value than the valuequeried in Bolinger's example reproduced in (2).
If difficult andimpo.~Mble are viewed on a scale defined in d,.grees of feasibility,then Q can conclude that by affirming ghc higher value H hasaffirmed the lower.
Similarly, R may affirm an alternate value, ashe d~s  in (3h}.
If II sees Honoluh| and Hilo as b~,th members of aset of Hawaiian cities, he can affirm an unqueried set member(ltilo) to deny a queried member {llawaii).
The affirmati,~n of anunqueried ah,'rnate value generally conveys the falsity or R'signorance of the queried value.SA partial ord~-rin 9 may be defined as an irreflexive, tsymmr-trie, andtransitive rel~.tiou.Speakers may also license scalar implicat,ires by denying scalars.The dual to Horn's notion of affirming the highest affirmable v:duewould be negating the lowest deniable scalar.
In such a denial aspeaker may implicate his affirmation or ignorance of lowerscalars.
So, in exchanges like {9a), a value higher than a queriedvalue {here,(9} Q: Did you write a check for the rent?a.
R: l haven't mailed it yet.b.
R: I haven't signed it.c.
R: I didn't pay cash.a stage in the process of mortgage payment) may be denied toconvey the truth of the queried value.
R may also deny lowervalues (gb) or alternate vahscs (9c}.So, indirect scalar responses may be defined UlU,n a number ofmetrics and may involve the affirmation or negation of higher,lower, or alternate values.
They may also involve the affirmationor denial of more than one scalar h~r a single query, as shown in(10).
Ash';nine that Mary and Joe are brother and s:ster and bothare known to Q and tL Also, Mary and Tim are fellow-workerswith Q and R. Then to Q's question in {10), R may felicitouslyrespond with any or the(10) Q: Does Mary like skiing?a.
R: She loves iee-gkating.b.
R: ,Joe loves cross-country.e.
R: Tim likes cros~country.answers given - as well a~s a variety of others, such as 'Site n~edto' or even 'Joe used to love ice-skating.'
That is, R may base hisresponse upon any one or more scalars he perceives as invoked byQ's query.
In addition, a single lexical it(:m (here Mary} mayinvoke more than one scale: R may view Mary as a member of afamily or of a set of fellow-workers, for example, to generateresponses (10b) and (ll}c), respectively.C.
A Sca la r  Representat ion  of YNQs.Given this characterization of appropriate indirect responses, it ispossible to model the exchanges present,,d above in the followingway:1.
For some query uttered by Q, let P V "P  representthe query's desideratum;2.
Let Pxl/bl,x2/b2,...,Xn/bnV-Pxl/b~,xg/b2,...,Xn/bn re-present the open propozition formed by substitutingvariables xI for each b i ir~vokcd by P that R perceivesas lying on some scMe Si;3.
Then P V 'P  ?

A subset of these p~,ssit.qe re~ponses, the set of possiblet rue  respcmses, will be det~.rmined by 1?
from hisknowledge ba0:c, and an actual r~'sponsc ~l~lectcd.
7In 16), for example, the de.-.ider:dum {P V "q>) of Q's query is thegeneric '(all) mushrooms are poisonous' V 'not (all) mushrooms arepoisonous', tiers R might perceive a single scalar all lying on aquantifier scale, ,onc//~?ome/all.
So, 'x I mushrooms are poisonous'V 'not x I \[all,brooms ace poisonous' represents the (,penproF-sition formed b) substituting a variable for all in P, where x!ranges over the values on SI.
nor~,/oorn,~/u!l.
Then the set ofp..-.ible resp(.n~:.~ tt, t~'s query, given P~'s choice of seal:~r, isdt,fin~.d by the affirmatiml or ~wgati~m of cach of the possibleinstantiations of 'a l /x  I mushrooms at, ~ poisonous', or the set {nonlushrool/is are poisoIIOUS.SO.~le L'lushfooIIlS are poisonous.allmushrooms are poisonous,-nno mushrooms are poisonons, -some7S~.e lliir~ehberg, l~t~41 rr.r farth~ r diseusslon of this self'ca}on process.50mushr-on~s :~r~ poisonous, ~ail r:,,a,hro,~ms are poisonous}.
Theset of po,.-ibh, t rue  r,.sponscs will be a subset of this set,determined b)' It from Iris knowh:dgc ba.se.
Note that a I and b lmay in fact be identical.
Thus, the simple direct responses,equivalent to 'All mushrooms are poisonous' and 'Not allmushrooms are poi.~t)nous', are accorumodated in this schema.Thi~ charact~,riz:ttion of potcnt.ial response.-, suggests a newrepre~entath)n for YNt~s.
l'oih)wing Hintikka, one mightparaphrase the query in (6) as 'Bring it about that I know that x tmushro~Jnls are poisonous r~r that I know that.
not x t mushroomsart.'
poisonous t, where x I range~ over the values on some scale S tup.n which the qlo'ried v:due .~om( appears (assuming a many-sorted epi~temic logic).
Thus the query alight be represented as!
3~l.~X I (so:;,e,xtENtA {KQ(X I mushrooms arepois,,nou~) V KQ~(X t mi, shrooms are poisonous)}}.For a query like that in (It)), an appropriate representation mightbe:!
:3Sl-~Xt3S2.
:\]x2~\]Sa3x.~ {Mary,xtESiAIove,x2ES 2Askiing.xaES3A {KQ{X 1 x 2 x3) V KQ~(X l x 2 x3)}}.lI may then instantiate each variable with any value from itsdomain in his response.In the gem'ral e~e, then, YNQs might be represented as3SI,...,:JSa3xI,...,3x~, {bI,x1ES 1 A .... A bn,XnCS a A{KQ(l'x I ...... n) V Kq'{Pxt ...... n )}"This representation shares some features of standardrepresentations of wh-qm.stions, .~uggesting that it simply extendsKiefer's view of foct:s~ed "fNQs to all YNQs.
However, there areseveral :dgnificant di~tincthms between this representation andstandard repres,.ntatioas of wh-questk)ns, and, thus, between it andKiefer's suggesthm.
First, it restricts the domains of variables toscales invoked by corresponding scalars in the original queriesdesideratum and it includes a negative disjuuet.
'Do you likeIlonolulu?'
for example might have as its desideratum::IS |-:Ix t:~S2::lx2"\]Ss3xa {you,xl ES IAlike,x=ES2Allonolulu,x.~ES s A {KQ(X t x~ xsJVKq~(X i x 2 xs)}},while the corresponding wh-question 'What do you like?'
wouldhave as its desideratum 32 lfQfVou like z).
Second, therepresentation prop,sed here allows for reference in a query tomuhiple scalars, or, multiple focii, which Kiefer does not consider.Third, it awJids both the division of YNQs into focussed and non-focussed queries and the dependency between wh-responses andnegative responses noted above; hence, the representation issimpler and more unified.
So, YNQs are not represented as wh-questions, although Kiefer's focussed YNQs can be accommodatedin this more general representation, which 1 will term a ~eel~,"repreae~tatlo~.IV D ISCUSSIONA scalar representation f YNQs can accommodate a wide rangeof direct and indirect responses which are common in naturaldiscourse but which current representations of YNQs cannotsupport.
Of course, such a redefinition is no panacea for thelimitations of current representations: In its current form, forinstance, there are sonic appropriate responses to indirect speechacts, such as (i l l ,  which it(11) Q: Can you tell me the time?R: It's 5:30.will not support.
In other exchanges, such as {12), the notion ofseale may seem less tha,~ natural, where a scale like attribute* of a(12) Q: Is she pretty?R: She's married.potcnHal date.
: {pr~:ttg, unmarried,...} must be postulated toaccommodate this query in the the representation proposed here.Too, tbe actual representation of a particular query may varyaccording to participants' differing perception of scalars invokedby it, as shown in (I0).
Because scales are not defined in absoluteterms, it is difficult to determine ven an abstract specification ofthe set of all possible responses to a given query; should temporaland modal variables always be understood as  implicitly evoked byany query, for example, as in {13)?
However, if broad categories ofsucb(13) Q: Is Gloria a blonde?a.
R: She used to be.b.
R: She could be.
'understood' scales can be identified, much of this difficulty might.be alleviated.
The representation proposed here doesaccommodate a far larger class of appropriate responses thanrepresentations previously suggested, and accommodates them in aunified way.
With further refinement it promises to provide auseful tool for theoretical and computational treatments of YNQs.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS1 would like to thank Aravind Joshi, Kathy McCoy, MarthaPollack, Sitaram Lanka, and Bonnie Webber for their comments onthis paper.REFERENCESBolinger, D.
