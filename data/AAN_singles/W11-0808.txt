Thesetwo types of the constructions have the typicaltheoretical  and  implementation  problems  asmultiword  expressions (MWEs):  lexicalproliferation of the possible light verb senses inthe  lexicon,  potential  overgeneration  of  ill-formed  LVCs,  and  the  semanticcompositionality issue.
Adopting and adaptingthe idea of qualia structure (Pustejovsky, 1991)into  a  typed-feature  structure  grammar(Copestake, 1993; Copestake, 2002; Sag et al,2003),  I  suggest  that  some  Korean  commonnouns  have  their  associated  predicateinformation  in  their  lexical  entries  (e.g.,  thepredicate  meaning  cook is  included  in  thelexical  entry of  the common noun  pap 'rice').Thus  such  common  nouns  provide  anappropriate predicate meaning to the light verb.The  lexical  constraints  on  the  light  verb  andcommon nouns,  and  relevant  phrase  structurerules  allow me  to  capture  the  generalizationsand  idiosyncrasies  regarding  LVCs  in  asystematic way.1 Two Types of LVCsA particular type of Korean LVCs, exemplified in(1),  has  been  much  studied  (Chae,  1996,  2002;Choi and Wechsler, 2001; Kim et al, 2004; Kim etal., 2007, inter alia, and similar Japanese examplesin  Miyagawa,  1989;  Matsumoto,  1996;  Yokota,2005, among others):(1)a. ku-ka     [swuhak-ul  kongpwu-lul]he-Nom  math-Acc   study-Accha-yess-ta.11 Abbreviations: Nom = Nominative, Acc = Accusative, Pst =Past,  Dec  =  Declarative,  Pass  =  Passive,  Que  =  Question,Comp  =  Complementizer,  Top  =  Topicalization,  Rel  =Relative markerdo-Pst-Dec'He studied mathematics.'b.
ku-ka     [Mary-wa    tayhwa-lul] ha-yess-ta.he-Nom  Mary-with  talk-Acc       do-Pst-Dec'He talked with Mary.
'In  (1a),  the  light  verb  ha-yess-ta 'do-Pst-Dec'requires as its complement the verbal noun (VN)phrase, swuhak-ul  kongpwu-lul 'math-Acc  study-Acc', and thus the types of LVCs in (1) are calledVN-LVC in this paper, but see different syntacticanalyses in Choi and Wechsler, 2001; Kim et al,2004.
Although  the  light  verbs  are  the  syntacticheads of the VN-LVCs, the core  meanings of thesentences come from the verbal nouns.
The mixedproperties of VN in VN-LVC (that is,  a VN canassign  verbal  cases  to  its  arguments,  but  at  thesame time it can be modified by an adjective) haveattracted much research on VN-LVCs (Grimshawand  Mester,  1988  on  Japanese;  Cho  and  Sells,1991; Manning, 1993; Choi and Wechsler,  2001;Kim et al, 2007, among others).However,  there  are  many  other  usages  of  theKorean light verb ha 'do', which are almost ignoredin the literature.
In this paper, I investigate the twofrequently-used,  but  less-studied types  of  KoreanLVCs.In  the  first  type  of  the  LVCs,  the  light  verbrequires a phrase headed by a common noun (CN)as its object (so, it is named CN-LVC here):(2)a. ku-ka      pap-ul     ha-yess-ta.he-Nom  rice-Acc  do-Pst-Dec'He cooked/*ate the rice (result product).'b.
ku-ka      khephi-lul/*mwul-ul   ha-yess-ta.he-Nom  coffee-Acc/water-Acc  do-Pst-Dec'He brewed /drank the coffee/*water.
'In (2),  we can see that  the  meaning of  the lightverb is  determined by the object as with the VN-LVCs in (1).2 Almost every VN seems possible to2 Similar examples in English (Pustejovsky, 1991):40appear as the object in a VN-LVC.
However, notevery common noun can be the object  of  a CN-LVC.The questions that naturally arise are 1) how torepresent  the light  verbs  of the  CN-LVCs in thelexicon,  and  2)  how  to  formally  and  efficientlydescribe  the  way  the  predicate  meanings  (e.g.,brew and drink) are derived from the objects (e.g.,khephi-lul 'coffee-Acc').If we treat CN-LVCs as words-with-spaces, thenthey  suffer  from  a  lexical  proliferation  indescribing all possible meanings of the light verbexpressions  (e.g.,  do_drink_coffee,do_brew_coffee,  do_drink_tea,  do_brew_tea, etc.
)(see Sag  et al,  2002).
On the other hand, a fullycompositional  analysis  would  overgenerate  (e.glicensing  *mwul-ul  ha-yess-ta 'water-Acc  do-Pst-Dec' in (2b)) and would not be able to explain theproblem of the semantic compositionality (that is,exactly where and how does the predicate meaningof the light verb phrase in a CN-LVC come from?
)(see Sag et al, 2002).
These problems of the CN-LVCs are not properly treated yet.English LVCs have almost the same problems asthe  Korean  CN-LVCs:  idiosyncrasies  on  whichlight  verb combines  with a  given noun (Abeille,1988) (e.g., make a mistake, give a demo).
A fullycompositional  account,  on the other hand,  wouldbe  unable  to  block  alternative  light  verbcombinations  (e.g.,  *give  a  mistake,  *make  ademo) (see Sag et al, 2002).Moreover,  in  Korean  serial  verb constructions(SVCs) the situation gets more complicated:(3)a. ku-ka      pap-ul     hay  mek-ess-ta.he-Nom  rice-Acc  do    eat-Pst-Dec'He cooked the rice and ate it.'b.
ku-ka      khephi-lul*mwul-ul/    hayhe-Nom  coffee-Acc/ water-Acc  domasi-ess-ta.drink-Pst-Dec'He brewed/*drank  the coffee and drank it.
'i) Mary finished the cigarette.ii) Mary finished her beer.iii) John finished the book.The exact meaning of the verb is determined by the object:finish smoking for i),  finish drinking for ii) and finish writingfor  iii).
The  verb,  however,  has  also  its  own  meaning:finishing X.
So,  in  this  case,  the  verb  seems  to  be  anintermediate type between light and heavy verbs.In  (3),  the  specific  meanings  of  the  light  verbsdepend  on  the  common  noun  objects,  which  isparallel  with  the  CN-LVCs.
The  difference,however,  is  that  there  is  more  restriction  on  theappropriate choice from the associated predicate(s)for  the  determination  of  the  light  verb  meaning:e.g., only brew (creation sense) is allowed in (3b).I  return to  this semantic  restriction in  Section 3.The type of the constructions in (3) is called serialverb-light  verb  construction  (SV-LVC)  in  thispaper.SV-LVCs have the same problems as CN-LVCs,including  lexical  proliferation of  every  possiblesenses of the serial light verb expressions with thewords-with-spaces  approach,  the  potentialovergeneration,  and  the  question  of  semanticcompositionality.These issues of the Korean LVCs as MWEs arecrucial  problems  in  natural  language  processing(NLP) like the disambiguation problems (see Saget al, 2002).
The goal of this paper is to solve theproblems  and  to  present  an  efficient  formalaccount for CN- and SV-LVCs that is suitable forapplications to linguistically precise NLP.2 Grammatical Properties of CN-LVCsCN-LVCs are very  productive: the light verb  ha-'do' can combine with many (but not all) differentcommon nouns to constitute CN-LVCs.
The basicsemantic and syntactic properties of CN-LVCs arediscussed below.2.1 Semantic Constraints of CN-LVCsAs is already illustrated in (2), there are two kindsof idiosyncratic restrictions on CN-LVCs.
The firstone is about what common noun can appear as theobject in a CN-LVC:(4)a. ku-ka      pap-ul/*khwukhi-lul   ha-yess-ta.he-Nom  rice-Acc/*cookie-Acc  do-Pst-Dec'He cooked the rice/(int.)
baked the cookie.'b.
ku-ka      khemphwuthe-lul/*kaysanki-lulhe-Nom  computer-Acc/*calculator-Accha-yess-ta.do-Pst-Dec'He used the computer/*calculator.
'The examples  in (4) show that  only certain foodproducts or machines can occur as the objects inthe CN-LVCs.
The loan word khwukhi-lul 'cookie-41Acc' in (4a) is not allowed, but other loan words,such  as  khephi-lul 'coffee-Acc'  in  (2b)  andkhemphwuthe-lul  'computer-Acc' in (4b), are fine.There  seems  to  be  no  natural  semantic  class  ofcommon  nouns  that  can  appear  in  CN-LVCs,which  leads  me  to  attribute  the  idiosyncraticproperty to the individual common nouns.The second idiosyncratic property is about whatpredicate  is  associated with what  common  noun.For instance, in (4a)  the CN-LVC has only onereading,  'He  cooked the  rice',  not  otherinterpretations like 'He ate the rice,' although 'cook'and 'eat'  are (at least  semantically and maybe alsostatistically) plausible candidates for the associatedpredicates of the common noun  pap 'rice'.
Lapata(2001) uses a large corpus to acquire the meaningsof  polysemous  adjectives  (e.g.,  fast).
However,such  corpus  findings  only  tell  us  the  possibleinterpretations, but not impossible interpretations.It seems intuitive that common nouns have suchinformation  about  their  related  predicates  sincewithout  a  specific  predicate  given,  we  cannormally guess what predicate might come after acommon noun object in an incomplete sentence (atleast  in  Korean  whose  word  order  is  SOV)  (seesimilar  combinatoric information  related  withKorean VN of VN-LVCs in  Cho and Sells, 1991and Japanese VN in Manning, 1993).In short,  only some common nouns have suchinformation  about  certain  related  predicates.Pustejovsky (1991) refers to this kind of relation ascospecification:  i.e.
like  verb  can  select  for  itsargument  type,  an  argument  also  can  select  itsassociated  predicates.
The  associated  predicateinformation is included in the qualia structure of  alexical item (Pustejovsky, 1991).
Among the fourbasic  roles  in  qualia  structure,  the  telic  role  hasvalues  about  purpose  and function  of  the  object(e.g.,  read for  novel),  and  the  agentive  role  hasvalues  on  factors  involved  in  the  origin  or?bringing  about?
of  an  object  (e.g.,  write fornovel).Building on the qualia structure,  I  propose thatKorean  common  nouns  have  dual  semanticcomponents, the first  of which is the meaning ofthe common noun itself, and second of which is thequalia  structure.
Details  of  the  semantic  featurestructures of such common nouns are introduced inSection 5.2.2 Syntactic Constraints of CN-LVCsThe CN-LVCs allow internal adverb modification:(5)a. ku-ka      pap-ul      ppalli    ha-yess-ta.he-Nom  rice-Acc  quickly  do-Pst-Dec'He quickly cooked the rice.'b.
ku-ka     khemphwuthe-lul ppalli  ha-yess-ta.he-Nom computer-Acc     quickly do-Pst-Dec'He quickly used the computer.
'So, the CN-LVCs are like Syntactically-FlexibleExpressions (see Sag et al, 2002).
I treat the CN-LVCs  as  a  normal  transitive  verb  phraseconstruction  (generated  by  the  general  head-complement phrase rule) in syntax.Since  the  light  verb  ha 'do'  is  syntactically  atransitive verb, the passive counterparts of the CN-LVCs  are  predicted  to  be  generated.
However,only (4a) allows its passive:(6)a. ku-eyuyhay  pap-i        toy-ess-ta.he-by           rice-Nom  do.Pass-Pst-Dec'The rice (product, not raw material) wascooked by him.'b.
*ku-eyuyhay  khemphwuthe-kahe-by            computer-Nomtoy-ess-ta.do.Pass-Pst-DecThe passive light verb toy has the become meaning(i.e.
creation  sense).
The  associated  predicate  ofpap 'rice' is cook (an agentive role predicate).
Thusin (6a) toy is compatible with be cooked, which isalso  a  ?bringing  about?
predicate,  but  in  thepassive form.
However, khemphuthe 'computer' hasas  its  associated  predicate  use  (a  telic  rolepredicate)  and its passive form  be used is also atelic role predicate.
So, the creation meaning of toyis  not  compatble  with the  common noun subjectkhemphwuthe-ka 'computer-Nom' in (6b).In  sum,  CN-LVCs  are  basically  transitivephrases, but they are constrained by the semanticrelations  between  common  nouns  and  the  lightverb.3 Grammatical Properties of SV-LVCsAs CN-LVCs are highly productive, SV-LVCs areaccordingly very productive.
The two types of theLVCs  have  similar  semantic  and  syntacticconstraints.
But SV-LVCs are more restricted.423.1 Semantic Constraints of SV-LVCsAs noted in (3), there are lexical constraints on themeanings of SV-LVCs.
Consider (7):(7)a. ku-ka     pap-ul     hay   ponay-ess-ta.he-Nom  rice-Acc  do     send-Pst-Dec(lit.)
'He cooked the rice and sent it (to me).'b.
ku-ka      khephi-lul  hay  ponay-ess-ta.he-Nom  coffee-Acc  do    send-Pst-Dec(lit.)
'He brew the coffee and sent it (to me).
'Since  the  common  noun  pap 'rice'  has  only oneassociated predicate,  cook  as shown in (2a),  (7a)has only one reading.
Although khephi 'coffee' hastwo  associated  predicates,  drink  and  brew asevidenced  in  (2b), (7b)  also  has  only  oneinterpretation  with  brewed  (the  reading  that  hedrank  the  coffee  and  sent  it  somewhere  isimplausible).
Here,  two  hypotheses  on  theinterpretations  are  possible:  1)  any  associatedpredicate that is plausible and available is chosenfor the V1 light verb meaning, or 2) the V1 lightverb  meaning  must  be  a  creation  (that  is,  anagentive role predicate).The second hypothesis predicts that if a commonnoun has only a telic role predicate whose meaningis plausible in an SV-LVC, then the SV-LVC mustbe ill-formed.
This is confirmed below:(8) *ku-ka      khemphwuthe-lul  hayhe-Nom  computer-Acc         doponay-ess-ta.send-Pst-DecThe common noun khemphuthe 'computer' has theassociated predicate  use.
The meaning of the telicrole is plausible before the sending relation.
So, theungrammaticality of (8) rejects the first hypothesis.Thus I suggest that certain common nouns havecertain associated predicates information, and thenin an SV-LVC, an available predicate of  bringingabout meaning must be chosen as the meaning ofthe V1 light verb hay in the construction.
If such apredicate is not available, then the SV-LVC is ill-formed.
Also,  I  have  already illustrated  that  theagentive  role  predicate  of  a  common  noun  isrequired  for  the  generation  of  the  passive  CN-LVCs  like  (6a).
Then  how  about  passive  SV-LVCs?
I  discuss  this  question  in  the  followingsection.3.2 Syntactic Constraints of SV-LVCsFirst,  adverbs can modify the serial  verbs  in theSV-LVCs:(9)a. ku-ka      pap-ul      ppalli    hay  mek-ess-ta.he-Nom  rice-Acc  quickly  do    eat-Pst-Dec'He quickly cooked the rice and ate it.'b.
ku-ka     khephi-lul  ppalli    hayhe-Nom coffee-Acc quickly  domasi-ess-ta.drink-Pst-Dec'He quickly brew the coffee and drank it.
'SV-LVCs  are  also  categorized  intoSyntactically-Flexible  Expressions.
However,unlike CN-LVCs, the serial verbs (e.g.,  hay mek-ess-ta 'do eat-Pst-Dec') are complex predicates thatneed a special phrase (like (23) in Section 5).As  predicted,  a  common  noun  must  have  anagentive  role  predicate  to  license  a  well-formedpassive SV-LVC.
In other words, only if an SV-LVC is allowed, its passive SV-LVC is licensed:(10)a. pap-i/khephi-ka             toy-erice-Nom/coffee-Nom  do.Pass-Compponay-e       ci-ess-ta.send-Comp  Pass-Pst-Dec(lit.)
'The rice was cooked and sent (to me).'(lit.)
'The coffee was brewed and sent(to me).'b.
*khemphwuthe-ka  toy-ecomputer-Nom     do.Pass-Compponay-e       ci-ess-ta.send-Comp  Pass-Pst-DecJust like the passive CN-LVCs, the exact meaningof toy depends on the common noun subject.So,  SV-LVCs are complex predicate structuresin  syntax,  but  they  are  also  constrained  by  thesemantics of common nouns and the light verb.4 Pragmatic FactorsIf a rich context is given, some ill-formed LVCscan be saved:(11)a. ku-ka     *chayk-ul   ha-yess-ta.he-Nom   book-Acc  do-Pst-Decb.
ku-ka      sayngil    senmwul-lo  chayk-ulhe-Nom  birthday  present-as     book-Accha-yess-ta.43do-Pst-Dec'he gave a book as a birthday present.
'The telic role of senmwul 'present' is give and thistelic role seems to be passed to the object chayk-ul'book-Acc' in (11b).The grammaticality depends on what sense of aword is used in the sentence:(12)a.
*ku-ka       haksayng-ul  ha-yess-ta.he-Nom  student-Acc    do-Pst-Declb.
nwu-ka      haksayng  ha-lay?who-Nom  student      do-Que?
'Who told you to be a student?
'(from the Korean TV show, Hot Brothers)The ill-formed CN-LVC in (12a) can be saved in aspecial context where haksayng-ul 'student-Acc' isinterpreted as a student role of a play (then the telicrole  play for  the  light  verb),  or  in  a  colloquialcontext  like  (12b).
Being  a  student  (or  lawyer,teacher,  doctor,  etc.)
means  that  the  personperforms (telic role) the tasks of the position.The object of the light verb can be implicit:(13) ce     ken    twu-ko      kan-ta.
ne   hay.that  thing  leave-and  go-Dec.  you  do.
'Let me leave that thing for you.
You have it.
'(from the Korean movie, Hello Ghost)The common noun object ce ken 'that thing' of thelight verb is dropped from the second sentence of(13).
The associated predicate of the common nounobject  is  linked  to  the  light  verb  across  thesentence  boundary.
The  abandonment  of  thepossession of that thing seems to enforce the lightverb to have the meaning of  have.
Such verbs aswrite,  cook,  build are  related  with  physicalcreations, but  buy,  have,  possess are related withrelational creations.Leaving  the  detailed  formal  analysis  of  thepragmatic factors for future research, I focus on therepresentations  of  the  semantic  and  syntacticconstraints.5 Typed-feature Structure GrammarIn this section, I present the formal analyses of theCN-  and  SV-LVCs  in  a  typed-feature  structuresystem (Copestake, 2002) based on the frameworkof  the  Head-driven  Phrase  Structure  Grammar(Pollard and Sag, 1994; Sag et al, 2003).5.1 Type Hierarchy of KoreanFirst,  I  adopt the following type hierarchy of theKPSG (Korean Phrase Structure Grammar) (Kim,2004; Kim et al, 2004):(14) Type hierarchy of linguistic expressions3:signlex-st                                             syn-stverbal  nominal  adverbial  adnominal  lex-ex   phv-stem          n-stemnonstative-v   vn                        cnkongpwu 'study'   pap 'rice'tayhwa 'talk'        khephi 'coffee'khemphuthe  'computer'mwul  'water'The  type  vn has  the  mixed  properties  inheritedfrom  its  supertypes,  verbal and  n-stem  (seeMalouf,  1998,  2000;  Choi  and Wechsler,  2001).The type  cn also inherits  its  constraints  from itssupertypes:  for instance, nominal  properties fromthe type n-stem (see Kim et al, 2004).Briscoe  et  al.
(1990)  and  Copestake  (1993)illustrate  some  lexical  entries  with  the  qualiastructure following Pustejovsky and Aniek (1988),Pustejovsky  (1989,  1991).
For  example,autobiography  has its associated predicates,  write(the value of the agentive role) and read (the valueof  the  telic  role).
They  are  represented  in  thelexical entry of autobiography.I declare that Korean common nouns have boththe RESTR(ICTION) for normal semantics and theQUALIA-ST(RUCTURE),  which in  turn  has  theAGENTIVE  and  TELIC  attributes,  adopting  thebasic idea from Pustejovsky (1991) and adaptingthe  feature  structure  from  Copestake  (1993).Moreover,  I  posit  the  QUALIA  attribute  whosevalue is the sum of the values of the AGENTIVEand  TELIC.
Based  on  this  feature  structure,  Ipropose  the  following  representations  of  theKorean common nouns:3 The dashed line here means that there are intermediate typesbetween the types that are connected with it.44(15)a. Lexical entry for pap 'rice'b.
Lexical entry for khephi 'coffee'c.
Lexical entry for khemphuthe  'computer'd.
Lexical entry for mwul  'water'In (15a), pap 'rice' has its associated predicate cookas the value of the AGENTIVE, but it has no valuefor the TELIC.
Then, the QUALIA list must haveonly one value cook.
In (15b), khephi 'coffee' hasbrew  and  drink in  the  AGENTIVE  and  TELIC,respectively.
Then its QUALIA list includes  brewas its first value, and drink as its second value.
In(15c),  the  associated  predicate  of  khemphuthe'computer'  is  use (a telic role),  which is then thesole value for the QUALIA.
In (15d), mwul 'water'is  declared  not  to  have  any  value  for  theAGENTIVE or TELIC.
Thus, it  does not have avalue for the QUALIA, either.Now as  for  the  relevant  verbs  of  the  LVCs,  Idivide the type  tr(ansitive)-v(erb) in the followingtype hierarchy further into  tr(ansitive)-light-v(erb)and tr(ansitive)-nonlight-v(erb):(16) Type hierarchy of non-stative verbs:nonstative-vintr-v                 tr-v                           ditr-vtr-light-v      tr-nonlight-v    ponay- 'send'ha-1 'do'        mek- 'eat'ha-2 'do'        masi- 'drink'hay 'do.Comp'Three lexical entries of the light verbs are underthe type  tr-light-v.
They have different propertiesthat can be captured by the following constraints:(17)a.
Constraints on the type, nonstative-v:b.
Constraints on the type, tr-light-v:c. Constraints on ha-1:d. Constraints on ha-2:e. Constraints on hay:In (17a), the defeasible feature [LITE /?]
is positedon  nonstative-v.
So,  all  the  subtypes  inherit[LITE /?
], except for  tr-light-v  since in (17b), thedefeasible feature [LITE /?]
is  overridden by thespecification of the feature value.
Only two typestr-nonlight-v  and  ditr-v  can appear as V2 in SV-LVCs, and now they can be referred to as verbsthat  take  at  least  one  complement  and  have  thefeature [LITE /?].
In (17c), the RESTR of  ha-1 isclaimed to be empty list since the light verb thatcombines with a verbal noun phrase does not seemto contribute a core meaning to the VP as shown in(1).
However,  in  (17d),  the  meaning  of  ha-2 islinked to a value of the QUALIA of the commonnoun object.
This constraint of ha-2 will guaranteethat in CN-LVCs, any value in the QUALIA (e.g.,[ ]: LITE  +tr light v?

?>>45drink or  brew of  coffee)  can  be  chosen  for  thespecific meaning of the light verb.
Another effectof the constraint is  preventing the common nounslike  mwul 'water'  from appearing  in  a  CN-LVCsince such common nouns are declared to not havea value for the QUALIA as in (15d).
Finally,  in(17e), a separate lexical entry for the V1 light verbhay is posited due to the different properties fromha-2: e.g., ha-2 can get a tense, so is finite but haycannot receive a tense, so is nonfinite.
In addition,the meaning of the V1 light verb  hay  is identicalonly with the Agentive value of the common nounobject.5.2 Head-Complement CombinationsAlong with the lexical entries, syntactic rules areneeded.
In the type hierarchy of (14), the relevantsubtypes of syn-st are represented below (cf.
Kim,2004; Kim et al, 2004; Kim, 2010).
I added thenew type hd-sv-lv-ex as a subtype of hd-lex-ex:(18)          syn-stlex-ex                        phhd-comp-ph      hd-subj-ph    hd-mod-phhd-lex-exhd-sv-lv-exThe  following  general  head-complement  rule(see Sag et al, 2003; Kim 2004) generates a phraseof the type hd-comp-ph:(19) Head-Complement Rule:In  addition  to  the  syntactic  head-complementphrase rule, the following semantic constraints onthe structures are defined (Sag et al, 2003):(20)Semantic Compositionality Principle:In  any  well-formed  phrase  structure,  themother's  RESTR  value  is  the  sum  of  theRESTR values of the daughters.Equipped with the Head-Complement Rule andthe  Semantic  Compositionality  Principle,  VPs  inCN- and VN-LVCs can be generated:(21)a. Head-Complement Phrase of CN-LVC:b. Head-Complement Phrase of VN-LVC:In  (21),  according  to  the  SemanticCompositionality Principle, the VP in the CN- orVN-LVC has the sum of the RESTR values of theobject and the light verb.In the type hierarchy (18), the type  hd-comp-phhas  the  subtype  which  is  constrained  by  thefollowing Head-Lex Rule (cf.
Kim et al, 2004):(22) Head-Lex Rule:In (22),  the  head  element  combines  with  itscomplement,  whose  complements  and  some  ofhead's complements are passed up to the resultinghd-lex-ex.The constraints on  hd-lex-ex are inherited to itssubtype  hd-sv-lv-ex.
This  phrase  type  isresponsible for the combinations of the serial lightverb expressions in SV-LVCs:(23) Head-SV-LV-EX Rule:In  (23),  the  nonstative  verbs  with  [LITE  /?
](which are not intransitive) like eat, drink and sendrequire the V1 light verb hay as its complement.Now, the serial light verb expressions (e.g.,  haymek-ess-ta 'do.Pass  eat-Pst-Dec')  can  be  licensedwith the Head-SV-LV-EX Rule and the SemanticCompositionality Principle.
Furthermore, (23) canrule out  the ill-formed SV-LVCs like (8) *ku-kakhemphwuthe-lul  [hay  ponay-ess-ta] 'he-Nom[ ]LEX +1 , COMPS 1COMPS COMPShd lex ex BA B A?

<?>>H46computer-Acc do send-Pst-Dec' because  hd-sv-lv-ex requires  a  common  noun  object  that  has  anAGENTIVE  value,  but  khemphwuthe 'computer'has no value for it.
The implausible interpretation'#He drank the coffee and sent it (to me)' for (7b)[ku-ka  khephi-lul  [hay  ponay-ess-ta]] is  alsoblocked since the meaning of the light verb hay islinked only to the AGENTIVE value of the object.The  following  feature  structures  show  theanalyses  of  the  VP [pap-ul  ha-yess-ta] 'rice-Accdo-Pst-Dec' in the CN-LVC (2a) and the VP [pap-ul  [hay  mek-ess-ta]] 'rice-Acc  do  eat-Pst-Dec'  inthe SV-LVC (3a):(24) [pap-ul ha-yess-ta]:(25) [pap-ul [hay mek-ess-ta]]:6 Conclusion and Future WorkThe light verb ha-2 'do' is used for CN-LVCs andhay is  used  for  SV-LVCs.
I  also  proposed  thatcertain  Korean  common  nouns  have  theirassociated predicate meanings in the QUALIA-ST.These  lexical  constrains  on  individual  commonnouns and the light verbs, and the relevant phrasestructure  rules  account  for  the  regular  andidiosyncratic  properties  of  the  two  LVCconstructions in a systematic manner.I believe that  the current  analysis can possiblyextend  to  the  corresponding  LVCs  in  otherlanguages (especially Japanese since it has similarLVCs with the light verb suru 'do' and allows serialverbs).
The VPs with the verbs start or finish (seePustejovsky, 1991) can also be accounted for usingthe  qualia  structure:  e.g.,  pap-ul sicakhata/kkuthnayta 'start/ finish (cooking/*eating) the rice',khephi-lul sicakhata/  kkuthnayta 'start/  finish(brewing/*drinking)  the  coffee',  khemphuthe-lulsicakhata/  kkuthnayta 'start/  finish(*building/using)  the  computer'  and  *mwul-ulsicakhata/  kkuthnayta.
My  temporary  hypothesisfor such the VPs is that there is the ranking (that is,agentive role > telic role), so the agentive role of acommon  noun  object  is  used  first  with  start orfinish,  but  if  agentive  role  is  not  available,  thentelic  role  is  used,  and  if  even  telic  role  is  notavailable, then it is ungrammatical.More comprehensive research with corpus dataand the actual implementation of the analysis in theLinguistic  Knowledge  Building (LKB)  system(Copestake, 2002) are left for future work.AcknowledgmentI  would like to thank Katrin  Erk for  her helpfulcomments.
