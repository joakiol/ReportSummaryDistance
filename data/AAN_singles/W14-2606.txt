Unfortunately, the ease of postingcontent online, potentially anonymously, com-bined with the public's trust and growing relianceon this content, creates opportunities and incen-tives for abuse.
This is especially worrisome in thecase of online reviews of products and services,where businesses may feel pressure to post decep-tive opinion spam---fictitious reviews disguised tolook like authentic customer reviews.In recent years, several approaches have been pro-posed to identify deceptive opinion spam based onlinguistic cues in a review's text.
In this talk I willsummarize a few of these approaches.
I will addi-tionally discuss some of the challenges research-ers face when studying this problem, including thedifficulty of obtaining labeled data, uncertaintiessurrounding the prevalence of deception, and howlinguistic cues to deceptive opinion spam varywith the text's sentiment (e.g., 5-star vs 1- and 2-star reviews), domain (e.g., hotel vs. restaurant re-views) and the domain expertise of the author(e.g., crowdsourced vs. employee-written decep-tive opinion spam).31
