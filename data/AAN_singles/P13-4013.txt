Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 73?78,Sofia, Bulgaria, August 4-9 2013. c?2013 Association for Computational LinguisticsPhonMatrix: Visualizing co-occurrence constraints of soundsThomas MayerResearch UnitQuantitative Language ComparisonPhilipps University of Marburgthomas.mayer@uni-marburg.deChristian RohrdantzData Analysis and Visualization GroupUniversity of Konstanzchristian.rohrdantz@uni-konstanz.deAbstractThis paper describes the online tool Phon-Matrix, which analyzes a word list with re-spect to the co-occurrence of sounds in aspecified context within a word.
The co-occurrence counts from the user-specifiedcontext are statistically analyzed accord-ing to a number of association measuresthat can be selected by the user.
Thestatistical values then serve as the inputfor a matrix visualization where rows andcolumns represent the relevant sounds un-der investigation and the matrix cells indi-cate whether the respective ordered pair ofsounds occurs more or less frequently thanexpected.
The usefulness of the tool isdemonstrated with three case studies thatdeal with vowel harmony and similar placeavoidance patterns.1 IntroductionIn this paper, we introduce the PhonMatrix1 tool,which is designed to visualize co-occurrence con-straints of sounds within words given a reasonablysized word list of the language.
It is a web-basedimplementation of the visualization method pro-posed in (Mayer et al 2010a), including somefurther development such as an interactive com-ponent and a range of association measures andsorting methods to choose from.
The original mo-tivation for this tool is to give linguists the oppor-tunity to upload their own word lists in order tovisually explore co-occurrence constraints in lan-guages.
The basic idea behind the visual compo-nent of the tool is to provide for a first, at-a-glancemode of analysis which can be used to generatehypotheses about the data by simply looking at thevisualization matrices.1http://paralleltext.info/phonmatrix/Phonotactic constraints in languages abound.One of the most well-known and wide-spread con-straints is commonly referred to as vowel har-mony (van der Hulst and van de Weijer, 1995).
Invowel harmony languages, vowels are separatedinto groups where vowels of the same group tendto co-occur within words, while vowels from dif-ferent groups rarely co-occur.
Likewise, in somelanguages there are patterns of consonant har-mony (Hansson, 2010) that show a similar behav-ior with respect to consonants.
Less common arecases of ?synharmonism?
(Trubetzkoy, 1967, p.251) where both vowels and consonants form suchgroups and words usually only contain soundsfrom the same group (e.g., only front vowels andpalatalized consonants).
Whereas vowel harmonypatterns are easily detectable in many harmoniclanguages due to the harmonic alternants in af-fixes, other co-occurrence constraints are less ob-vious.
This is especially true for disharmonic pat-terns, the most famous of which is the principleof Similar Place Avoidance (SPA) in Semitic con-sonantal roots (Greenberg, 1950).
Recent studieshave shown that this principle is not only activein Semitic languages, where it was already knownby grammarians in the Middle Ages, but is a morewidespread tendency among the languages of theworld (Pozdniakov and Segerer, 2007; Mayer etal., 2010b).
One of the reasons why statistical con-straints like SPA are more difficult to detect is thefact that they exhibit many frequent counterexam-ples and are therefore less easily spotted as a gen-eral (albeit statistical) tendency.In our view, there are many more phonotacticconstraints that wait to be discovered by linguists.With the availability of language data in electronicformat such tendencies can be automatically pro-cessed and presented to the user in a form thatallows for an easy exploration of the results in ashort period of time.
Thus a larger number ofphonotactic contexts can be explored in order to73find potential patterns in the data.
The PhonMa-trix tool is part of an ongoing effort to integratemethods and techniques from the field of visualanalytics (Thomas and Cook, 2005) into linguis-tic research.
The present tool will be graduallyaugmented with further functionalities in order toenhance its usefulness.2 Related workA related tool that quantifies the co-occurrence ofsounds in a given corpus is the Vowel HarmonyCalculator (Harrison et al 2004).
The major dif-ference between PhonMatrix and the Vowel Har-mony Calculator is that the latter is restricted tothe context of vowel harmony and requires the userto input the harmony classes beforehand whereasPhonMatrix is designed to detect these classesby making potential harmonic patterns more eas-ily perceptible to the user.
The Vowel HarmonyCalculator quantifies the notion of vowel har-mony for the input corpus by giving the percent-age of harmonic words and the harmony threshold.The harmony threshold is the percentage of wordsthat would be expected to be harmonic purely bychance.
The output of the Vowel Harmony Cal-culator consists of a list of values (number ofpolysyllabic words, harmony threshold, percent-age of harmonic words, harmony index, amongother things) but does not give any informationabout the harmonic strength of individual vowelpairs.
In short, the Vowel Harmony Calculator isa way to quantify the notion of harmony given theharmony classes of the language whereas Phon-Matrix is intended to help detect such patterns.3 System overviewPhonMatrix is a web-based visualization tool thatstatistically analyzes sound co-occurrences withinwords and displays the result in a symmetric soundmatrix.
The statistical components are writtenin Python whereas the visualization part is inJavascript, using the D3 library (Bostock et al2011).
Before discussing the individual steps ofthe system in more detail we will give a briefoverview of the overall processing pipeline (seeFigure 1).In the first step, the user has to upload the textfile containing the word list that serves as the in-put to the analysis process.
Text files have to beencoded in UTF-8 and list only one word per line.For a meaningful analysis the words should begiven in some phonemic transcription (e.g., usingIPA).2After the file has been uploaded to the server allsymbols in the word list are analyzed accordingto their unigram and bigram frequencies.
Thesefrequencies are used to infer an automatic dis-tinction between vowels, consonants and infre-quent symbols.
Infrequent symbols are consid-ered to be noise in the data and can be ignoredfor further processing.
A distinction between vow-els and consonants is automatically inferred fromthe word list by means of Sukhotin?s algorithm(Sukhotin, 1962).
The results of Sukhotin?s algo-rithm are presented to the user together with thefrequency counts of the individual symbols in theword list.In the third step, the user can make changes tothe automatic classification of symbols into vow-els and consonants and exclude infrequent sym-bols from further consideration.
The subsequentcalculations of co-occurrence values are mostlybased on the distinction of input symbols into con-sonants (C) and vowels (V).
Users can chooseamong a number of options that define the con-text for the co-occurrence calculations.3 Two ofthose options will be discussed in more detail inthis paper (vowel co-occurrences in VCV and CCsequences).
Depending on the user?s choice, theco-occurrences in the selected context are calcu-lated and analyzed with respect to a number of sta-tistical association measures from which the usercan choose one for the visualization.In the last step, the results of the statistical anal-ysis of the co-occurrence counts are displayed in aquadratic matrix of sounds.
The rows and columnsof the matrix represent the individual sounds thatare relevant for the selected context (e.g., vow-els in the context of VCV sequences).
The rowsthereby stand for the first members of the relevantsound pairs, whereas the columns contain the sec-ond members.
Each cell of the matrix then showsthe result for the pair of sounds in the respectiverow and column.The final result is a visualization of the co-occurrence matrix with rows and columns sortedaccording to the similarity of the sound vectorsand statistical values represented as colors in thematrix cells.
The visualization features a number2For more information on the minimum amount of datanecessary see (Mayer et al 2010a).3It is also possible for users to define their own contextswith regular expressions.74File%upload% Preprocessing,%VC4dis5nc5on%User%selects%context%Co4occurrence%sta5s5cs% Visualiza5on%Figure 1: The processing pipeline of the PhonMatrix visualization tool.of interactive components that facilitate the detec-tion of potential patterns in the results by the user.4 PhonMatrix componentsPhonMatrix consists of three main components:preprocessing (including vowel-consonant dis-tinction), statistical analysis of co-occurrencecounts and visualization.
In what follows, we willdescribe each component in more detail, with spe-cial emphasis on the visualization component.4.1 Vowel-consonant distinctionMost of the co-occurrence restrictions that mightbe of interest make reference to a distinction be-tween vowels and consonants.
Since a manualclassification of all sounds in the input into vowelsand consonants is a tedious task (especially witha larger number of symbols), the first componentdeals with an automatic inference of such a dis-tinction.
Many methods have been discussed inthe literature on how to discriminate vowels fromconsonants on the basis of their distribution intexts.
Many of them involve many lines of codeand are computationally demanding.
Yet there is avery simple and fast algorithm that yields reason-ably good results (Sukhotin, 1962; Guy, 1991).The basic idea of Sukhotin?s algorithm is thatvowels and consonants have the tendency not tooccur in groups within words but to alternate.Based on the additional assumption that the mostfrequent symbol in the text is a vowel, the algo-rithm iteratively selects the symbol which occursmost frequently adjacent to a vowel and deter-mines it to be a consonant.
The algorithm stopsif no more consonants can be selected because noco-occurrence counts with any remaining vowelare positive.
Although the algorithm is quite oldand very simple, it gives reasonably good results(Goldsmith and Xanthos, 2009; Guy, 1991; Sas-soon, 1992).
PhonMatrix makes use of Sukhotin?salgorithm as a preprocessing step to give a firstguess of the class for each symbol, which the usercan then modify if it turns out to be wrong.
Itmainly serves to speed up the classification step.4.2 Co-occurrence statisticsWith the distinction of symbols into vowels andconsonants at hand, the user can then select a rel-evant context for the co-occurrence counts.
Therelevant context can be chosen from a list of pre-defined options.
Here we will illustrate the statis-tical analysis with the context of VCV sequencesto investigate vowel harmony in Turkish.
The in-put consists of 20,968 orthographic words fromthe Turkish New Testament.4 The tool automati-cally extracts all VCV sequences in the words andcounts the co-occurrences of sounds in these se-quences.
The counts are then summarized in aquadratic contingency table and can be used forfurther statistical analyses.In our experiments, two measures turned out tobe especially useful for the detection of potentialpatterns: the probability and ?
values.
The ?
valueis a normalized ?2 measure which allows for aneasier mapping of values to the color scale becauseit is always between ?1 and 1.5 The ?
values forthe vowels in the Turkish text are shown in Table1.
Apart from probability and ?
values, the usercan also choose among a number of other asso-ciation measures such as pointwise mutual infor-mation, likelihood ratios or t-scores (Manning andSchu?tze, 1999).4.3 Visualization componentThe input to the visualization component is a ma-trix of association measures for each sound pairin the relevant context.
Two additional steps haveto be performed in order to arrive at the finalmatrix visualization: 1) the rows and columnsof the matrix have to be sorted in a meaning-ful way; 2) the association measures have to bemapped to visual variables.
For the matrix ar-rangement, we decided to have the same order ofsymbols for the rows and columns.
The orderof symbols is determined by a clustering of the4Turkish orthography represents the modern pronuncia-tion with a high degree of accuracy.5Apart from this, ?
makes good use of the off-diagonalcells in the contingency tables (Church and Gale, 1991).75a e i o u o?

The clustering is performed with the Pythonscipy.cluster.hierarchy package fromthe SciPy library.
As a default setting Ward?s al-gorithm (Ward, 1963) is used but other clusteringalgorithms can also be easily integrated.Whereas the preprocessing steps and the data-driven sorting of rows and columns have beenwritten in Python, the actual visualization of theresults in the browser is implemented in Javascriptusing the D3 library (Bostock et al 2011).
Theassociation measures and the order of the sym-bols are referenced as Javascript variables in thevisualization document.
The data is then automat-ically bound to DOM elements of the HTML doc-ument through the D3 data operator.
The mappingfrom association measures to color values is madewith the linear scale method from the d3.scalepackage.
Scale methods map from an input do-main to an output range.
The input domain for the?
values is the interval [?1; 1], while the outputrange can be given as a color scale ranging fromone color to the other.
For the ?
values we de-cided to use two unipolar scales, one from ?1 to0 (red) and the other from 0 to +1 (blue).
In orderto reserve a larger color range for the densely pop-ulated area of low values we did not linearly mapthe numerical association measures but used thesquare roots of the numerical values as the inputfor the scale function.
Additionally, the sign of the?
value, which shows whether the co-occurrenceof a certain symbol pair occurs more (+) or less(?)
frequently than expected, is displayed in thematrix cell.6 The result of the matrix visualizationfor the ?
values of the vowels in Turkish VCV se-quences is shown in Section 5.1.6The algebraic sign is displayed in white and thereforestands out more clearly with higher absolute ?
values.The matrix visualization also features some in-teraction to explore the results in more detail.
Onmouse-over, the respective matrix cell shows theactual values that serve as the input for the datamapping process.
Additionally, the row and col-umn labels are highlighted in order to show moreclearly which pair of symbols is currently selected(see Figure 2).
The size of the matrix can alsobe adjusted to the user?s needs with the help ofa slider above the matrix.
Next to the slider is adropdown menu from which users can choose theassociation measure that they want to be displayedin the visualization.5 Case studiesAfter the description of the PhonMatrix system wewill illustrate the usefulness of the visualization ofco-occurrence patterns in sounds with three casestudies.
They are presented as a proof of conceptthat the visualization component allows for an at-a-glance exploration of potential patterns.
The vi-sualization part is thereby not considered to be areplacement of more detailed linguistic investiga-tions but rather serves as a way to explore a mul-titude of different contexts and data in a compara-tively short period of time.
After a suspicious pat-tern has been detected it is indispensable to lookat the actual data to see whether the visualizationresult is an artifact of the method or data at handor whether the detected pattern is an interestingphonotactic feature of the language under consid-eration.5.1 Turkish vowel harmonyThe first case study shows the results of the VCVsequences in Turkish described above.
For thispurpose the vowels a, e, i, o, u, o?, u?, ?
are selectedas the relevant sounds that are to be compared in7628.05.13 22:02Matrix VisualizationSeite 1 von 1file:///Users/thommy/Dropbox/Code/PhonMatrix/matrix.htmlAssociation measure: Phi matrix File: turkish.txtOrder: Complete linkageSize:?+ +?????

Figure 2 shows the results forthe ?
values that have been computed from theco-occurrence counts of the symbols in VCV se-quences.
The arrangement of the symbols in thematrix rows and columns already show a distinc-tion between front (the first four vowels) and back(the last four vowels) vowels, reflecting the palatalharmony in Turkish.
This distinction can best beseen when looking at the e- and a-columns wherethe top four vowels all have positive ?
values fore and negative ?
values for a, whereas the bottomfour vowels show the opposite behavior.
On closerinspection, the labial harmony for high vowels canalso be seen in the matrix visualization.
From topto bottom there are always pairs of vowels thattake the same harmonic vowel, starting with (o?,u?)
taking u?
and followed by (e, i) taking i, (o, u)taking u and finally (a, ?)
taking ?.
The usefulnessof the visualization component to detect such pat-terns can best be seen when comparing Figure 2with Table 1, which contains the same informa-tion.5.2 Finnish vowel harmonyThe second case study shows that the harmonicpatterns can also be detected in orthographicwords of the Finnish Bible text.
Finnish differsfrom Turkish in having only one type of harmony(palatal harmony) and neutral vowels, i.e., vowelsthat do not (directly) participate in the harmonyprocess.
As a different underlying associationmeasure for the visualization consider the proba-bility values in Figure 3.

and the neutral vowels(e, i).
The blocks along the main diagonal of thematrix show the harmonic pattern among the har-mony groups, whereas the neutral vowels do notdisplay any regular behavior.5.3 Maltese verbal rootsPhonMatrix is not only useful to find vowel har-mony patterns.
The third case study shows thatother co-occurrence constraints such as SPA canalso be detected.
To illustrate this, we show thevisualization of CC patterns in a comprehensivelist of Maltese verbal roots (Spagnol, 2011).
Theconsonant matrix in Figure 4 shows two clusters,with one cluster (the first twelve consonants inthe top row) containing labial and dorsal and theother cluster (the last eleven consonants) compris-ing only coronal consonants.8 The visualizationalso reveals that, unlike in vowel harmony, conso-nants from the same cluster do not occur next toeach other in the CC sequences, as shown by thered blocks in the top left and bottom right.
This isexactly what SPA would predict.7The+/?
signs in the matrix are taken from the ?
values.8The consonants are given in their orthographic represen-tation (Borg and Azzopardi-Alexander, 1997, p. 299).7728.05.13 22:00Matrix VisualizationSeite 1 von 1file:///Users/thommy/Dropbox/Code/PhonMatrix/matrix.htmlAssociation measure: Phi matrix File: turkish.txtOrder: Complete linkageSize:?????
