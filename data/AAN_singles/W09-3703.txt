Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Computational Semantics, page 3,Tilburg, January 2009. c?2009 International Conference on Computational SemanticsInvited TalkPlay your way to an annotated corpus:Games with a purpose and anaphoric annotationMassimo PoesioUniversita` di TrentoLanguage Interaction & Computation LabCenter for Mind/Brain SciencesandUniversity of EssexLanguage and Computation GroupSchool of Computer and Engineeringmassimo.poesio@unitn.itAbstractThe lack of large-scale corpora annotated with semantic information hasbeen a serious bottleneck for computational semantics, slowing down notonly the development of more advanced statistical methods, but also ourempirical understanding of the phenomena.
The creation of the Ontonotescorpus will finally bring computational semantics to the point where com-putational syntax was in 1993 - but in the meantime, we have come toappreciate the limitations of that methodology both theoretically and asa way of gathering judgments.
In this talk, I will discuss an ongoing ef-fort to use the ?Games with a Purpose?
methodology to create a large-scaleanaphorically annotated corpus in which multiple judgments are maintainedabout the interpretation of each anaphoric expression - and in particular,the Phrase Detectives game:http://www.phrasedetectives.orgJoint work with Jon Chamberlain and Udo Kruschwitz (Uni Essex)3
