of Computer and Information SciencesUniversity of DelawareNewark, Delaware, USA[charlieg|mccoy]@cis.udel.eduAbstractWe report on an attempt to extend a referencegeneration system, originally designed onlyfor main subjects, to generate references formultiple entities in a single document.
Thisendeavor yielded three separate systems: oneutilizing the original classifier, another with aretrained classifier, and a third taking advan-tage of new data to improve the identificationof interfering antecedents.
Each subsequentsystem improved upon the results of the pre-vious iteration.1 IntroductionThis paper provides a system report on our submis-sion for the GREC-NEG (Named Entity Generation)Task, one of the two shared task competitions forGeneration Challenges 2009.
The objective is to se-lect the most appropriate reference to named entitiesfrom a given list of alternatives.
The corpus consistsof introductory sections from approximately 1,000Wikipedia articles in which single and plural refer-ences to all people mentioned in the text have beenannotated (Belz and Varges, 2007).
The training setcontains articles from the categories of Chefs, Com-posers, and Inventors.
GREC-NEG differs from theother challenge task, GREC-MSR (Main SubjectReferences), in that systems must now account formultiple entities rather than a single main subject,and the corpus includes only articles about personsrather than a variety of topics.2 System DescriptionOur GREC-NEG systems build upon our work forthe GREC-MSR task.
Our original approach wasto consult findings in psycholinguistic research forguidance regarding appropriate feature selection forthe production of referring expressions.
We reliedupon several common factors recognized by multi-ple authors (Arnold, 1998; Gordon and Hendrick,1998), including Subjecthood, Parallelism, Recency,and Ambiguity.
We followed (McCoy and Strube,1999) who stressed the importance of Recency inreference generation.
Finally, we made a prelimi-nary attempt at identifying potential interfering an-tecedents that could affect the Ambiguity of pro-nouns (Siddharthan and Copestake, 2004).As an initial attempt (UDel-NEG-1), we simplyextended our GREC-MSR submission.
By adapt-ing our system to account for multiple entities andthe slightly different data format, we were able touse the existing classifier to generate references forGREC-NEG.
We suspected that accuracy could beimproved by retraining the classifier, so our next sys-tem (UDel-NEG-2) added entity and mention num-bers as features to train on.
Presumably, this couldhelp distinguish between the main subject and sec-ondary entities, as well as plural references.
Asall named entities are tagged in the GREC-NEGcorpus, we leveraged this information to improveour recognition of other antecedents interfering withpronoun usage in a third new system (UDel-NEG-3).
As in our GREC-MSR submission, all three ofour GREC-NEG systems trained C5.0 decision trees(RuleQuest Research Pty Ltd, 2008) on our set offeatures informed by psycholinguistic research.3 ResultsSystem performance, as tested on the developmentset and scored by the GREC evaluation software,105is offered in Tables 1, 2, and 3.
Type accuracyfor UDel-NEG-1 remained close to our GREC-MSRsubmission, and error rate was reduced by over 20%for UDel-NEG-2 and UDel-NEG-3.
However, stringaccuracy was very low across all three systems, ascompared to GREC-MSR results.Table 1: GREC scores for UDel-NEG-1 (unmodified).Component Score Valuetotal pairs 907reg08 type matches 628reg08 type accuracy 0.69239250275634reg08 type precision 0.688699360341151reg08 type recall 0.688699360341151string matches 286string accuracy 0.315325248070562mean edit distance 1.55126791620728mean normalised edit dist.

All three systems yielded poor scores for stringaccuracy as compared to GREC-MSR results, sug-gesting an area for improvement.ReferencesJennifer E. Arnold.
