In this paper we establishsome stylistic criteria for the confirmation or refutationof these hypotheses.Clustering methods were found to be a useful additionto the conventional statistical methods.
The chapters of thebook are presented as points in an n-dimensional Euclideanspace, where ~ is optionally determined.
