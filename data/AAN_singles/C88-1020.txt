The degreeof fit of the OUtl~Ut from snch a system to the observeddurations in tile text provides a guide both to the accuracy ofIlle rule-set and to tile rate-related variation within that text.Statistic~l procedures can bc applied to reduce the rule-relatederror au, l thereby strengthen both the predictions of the rulesand the quantification of the rate variation.

Absolutemcasure.~, of duration in a text tell little about tile relativelengths (,f seglnents, and aceouut Inust be taken of all otherfactors involved if relative valncs such as 'long', 'short', 'fast',or 'slow' are to be applied.Simple lmasures of speech rate, Sllch as 'words-per-lninutc',and 'syllabics-per-second' account well for variation at a globallevel, blli: are inadequate to describe local changes in rate, dueto thc effects of differences in the structure of words andsyllables~ Words can be menu- up p0Iy-syllabic/and syllablesthemselves can vary greatly in the nmnber and type ofsegments occurring lU onset, peak and coda positions.
Ameasure of a snlall number of words or syllables, expressed asa rate in counts per unit of tin,e, will be affected by thecomplexity of the compouent units, structure of syllabics orsyllabicity of words, such that a Stl'ing of simple units will yielda higher rate than the salne number of more COlnplex ones.This eff~mt is reduced somewhat as tile nulnber of miltsincreases and a Inure balanced distribution occl.trs, bnt willalways b,; tlrescnt as a corrupting factor in the accuracy of therate nlc~lsurcment.
It is likely that text type, with stylisticdiffercnc~zs in lexical choice, will be a strong determiner of'rate' in measnres such as these, and a more text-independentmethod is rcqniredSegment~: would seem to be a better unit for suchmeasurel,aent, bat as yet there is uo satisfactory method ofdetermining segmcnt boundaries for automated nmasurement,and the lminber of decisious required for lneasurement byhandof a passage of text long enough to provide statisticallyadequate icsulls would bc both unecouomical nd error-prone.In tile present study, a compromise is rcachcd in the choice ofsyllables as basic unit, so boundary decisions arc reduced andenough measurements call be taken to allow statistically validconclusions to be made.
A method of normalising fordiffcrenccs ill syllabic structure is proposed.THE I)ATABASEA database of five thousand syllables wits prepared fl'omrecordings in tile Spoken English Corpus \[1\] which have beenprosodically transcribed, tagged for part of speech andpunctuated.
These wcrc lncasured for duration and transcribedl)honelnically.
Salnples chosen wcrc one long text, atwenty-minute broadcast of a short story by Doris Lessing,read by Elizabeth Bell, of apl3roximately four thousandsylhlbles, and two shorter texts of approximately five hundredsyllables each, one Open University lccturc on l)hilosophy, andone news extract, for cross-checking.Sylhlbles were measured in milliseconds from recordingsdigitiscd at 10k Hz (4.5k lowpass filtered) with the IBM UKSCSAY speech analyser \[2, 3\] using interactive graphic displayat one-thousand samplcs per screen-width, and simultaneousauditory rcplay of tile waveform.
Hard copy of both thewaveform and gain plots were retained for reference purposes.In the case of ambisyllabicity, the clcarcst boundary in tileacoustic waveform was selected, and the phoimmictranscription, later to be used as input to tile rule system.marked accordingly.FITTING THE RULES'The rules operate within the framework of a model ofdurational behaviour which statcs that (a) each rule tries toeffect a percentage increase or decrease in tile duration of asegment, but (b) segments cannot be compressed shorter thana certain ininimum duration.
The model is summariscd by thefor,nulaDUR = \[(INHDUR - MINDUR)*PRCNT\]/100 +MINDURwhere INHDUR is the inherent segment du,'ation ill lns,MINDUR is the minimuln duration of a segment if stressedand PRCNT is the percentage shortening determined by therules.'
(D. H. Kiatt \[4\])An iterative process was used to match the nile set (originallydesigned for American English, based on the durations of asingle male speaker, and takcn fi'om CVC words in fi'amesentences uttered in a controlled environment) to the durationsrcquired for the prediction of British English and for thisparticular spcakcr-text pail'.
The phonemic transcription of tiletest text was uscd as input to a computer iInpleinentation of93the Klatt \[5\] rules for duration prediction, and the resultingsegment values summed to the syllable level.
These werecompared with the measured urations according to the factorsunderlying the rules, which were in turn adjusted accordingly.The same input was passed through the improved rules and theprocess repeated until the output stabilised.Segment durations were first adjusted, by sorting 'fit' for eachsyllable, expressed as a percentage of predicted duration toobserved, by natu,'e of the segments appearing.
Thus, /t'/ forexample, although assigned an inherent dnration of 120ms anda minimum of 60ms in the Klatt rules, was found to beappearing in syllables that were consistently overpredicted, andby reducing its inherent duration in the rules to 95ms, and itsminimum to 50ms, a better overall fit was observed.
An exactfit is not to be expected since the rules make no allowance forspeech-rate variation, other than offering a single variable('PRCNT') that can be reset to change the overall rate ofduration.
The variance observed in the fit for any individualfactor will never be reduced below the variance of theunderlying speech rate changes, but can only be minimiscd.The original rules assume that the minimum duration of anunstressed segmcut is half that of the segment in a stressedposition.
On further analysis of segment fit according to stress,it was fouud that a better prediction could be achieved byspecifying absolute minima separately for the two situations;thus /k/ for example, while 65ms and 50ms for inherent andminimtun in the Klatt rules, was found to fit better if specifiedas 65ms and 35ms, with an absolute minimum (for theunstressed position) of 15ms.
The full table of final values withthe original defaults is shown in Fig 1.
These represent anintermediate stage in an iterative process, and arc not presentedas statements about individual segment durations per se.With these segment defaults fitted to the sample text, thewdues specified in the rules for modifying PRCNT weresimilarly adjnsted so that the best fit could be obtained.
Insummary, clause and phrase medial syllables were found to beovcrpredicted, and both initial and final syllablesunderpredicted; clause final syllables considerably so.
An extrarule was included to cover the case of phrase-initial syllables,which are not accessible through the framework of the originalrules \[6\].QUANTIFYING SPEECH-RATEWith the rules matched to the text at a global level throughstatistical analysis of averaged results, differences in output canbe examined at the local level.
Since there is no speech-rateinformation in the rule-set, differences will contain aquantification this, contaminated by noise from measurementand prediction error.There will inevitably be a certain amount of error inhand-measurement of several thousand syllables, no matterhow precise the equipment, but since the totals are cumulative,and sums can be simply checked against overall durations forstretches of the text, it can be assumed that the majority oferrors, will lie in boundary determination.
These can beovercome by smoothing with a three-syllable moving-.averagewindow since any over- or under-measurement in an individualsyllable should be compensated by a corresponding under- orover-measurement of its immediate neighbours.Errors in prediction will be systematic by definition, andtherefore susceptible to detection by statistical methods.

It can be expressedas a ratio ('SPRATE') of predicted rate in syllables/second toobserved rate in syllables/second calculated from smootheddata.
The above objection to syllables per second as a measureof speech-rate is overcome by comparing like with like m thepresent method.
ThusSPRATE(%) = (SMOOTHED PREDICTEDRATE/SMOOTHED OBSERVED RATE) * 100PRELIMINARY RESULTSAt the current iteration, sprate mean is 100.2% for 3959syllables \[7\], indicating an almost exact overall fit between tilepredicted and observed durations, but with a standarddeviation of 19.18 that is partly accounted for by the lack ofrate information.
Of the other factors contributing to thisvariation, no significant effects could be found for e.g.
the typeof syllable structure, the position of the syllable in the word,or the position of that word in the phrase or clause.
Part ofspeech, however, appeared to be a significant factor, withsprate results for selected categories as below,syllable type mean s.d.
(cst) nlexical verbs 102.7 0.7 626nouns 98.5 1.0 750adjectives 92.9 1.2 339adverbs 102.6 1.6 184which shows that while verbs and adverbs are slightlyoverpredicted by the rules, nouns and especially adjectives94would generally appear to be spoken more slowly than thertllcs prod et.An carlie."
iteration shewed that polysyllabicity, instead ofbeing in lllc domain of the word as the original rules In'edict,gives a better fit if measured in feet, and adjustments madeaccording to the number of the unstressed syllables that followeach stresl:cd syllable.A category that needs further examination is that of stressedbttl mmcccnled syllables which are 'prominent but have nopitch movement' \[8\].
By default, these are treated as stressed,but on examinalion of the results, sprate, which is 100.3 forunshessed syllables and 98.3 for stressed, is 106.7 forstresscd-lmt-unaccented, showing slight underprediction ofstressed syllables, but grealcl ovcrpredielion of theintermedi~,tc category.Of perhaps greater interest hough, is the fit of sprate to theperceived speeding up and slowing down in the presentationof the texi: by tile reader.
Taking tile mean sprate values forall syllabl(s in the tone-group, we find the following93.9 Walking down the path with her, he blurted out112.1 'i'd like to go and have a look at those rocksdown there.

'84.1 I t came blurting ont of him.where an increased sprate indicates overprediction i tile rulesor, conversely, a speeding up in the text.
Iiere, examples havehad to bc chosen to include texttml clues to the rate, butlistening to longer passages confirms that rate correlates wellwith sprale.
Further iterations will allow more confidentexamination at levels lower than tile sentence.DISCUSSIONAs Fig 2. suggests, a small random or high frequency errorsummed with a more slowly changing effect does little to hideits rhythms.
Speech rate cannot be expressed as a simple sinewave, but its effect on the prediction of segment duration byrule can tmrhaps be seen in this way and nntil its processes areunderstood, no predicted durations can match observationsfrom a real text - the lows cannot be slow enough nor the highslast enoul;h.
