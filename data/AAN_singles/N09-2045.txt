We propose a text simplification process,bioSimplify, that seeks to reduce the complex-ity of sentences in biomedical abstracts in or-der to improve the performance of syntacticparsers on the processed sentences.
Syntacticparsing is typically one of the first steps in atext mining pipeline.
Thus, any improvementin performance would have a ripple effectover all processing steps.
We evaluated ourmethod using a corpus of biomedical sen-tences annotated with syntactic links.
Our em-pirical results show an improvement of 2.90%for the Charniak-McClosky parser and of4.23% for the Link Grammar parser whenprocessing simplified sentences rather than theoriginal sentences in the corpus.1 IntroductionIt is typical that applications for biomedical textinvolve the use of natural language syntactic pars-ers as one of the first steps in processing.
Thus, theperformance of the system as a whole is largelydependent on how well the natural language syn-tactic parsers perform.One of the challenges in parsing biomedical text isthat it is significantly more complex than articles intypical English text.
Different analysis show otherproblematic characteristics, including inconsistentuse of nouns and partial words (Tateisi & Tsujii,2004), higher perplexity measures (Elhadad, 2006),greater lexical density, plus increased number ofrelative clauses and prepositional phrases (Ge-moets, 2004), all of which correlate with dimi-nished comprehension and higher text difficulty.These characteristics also lead to performanceproblems in terms of computation time and accura-cy for parsers that are trained on common Englishtext corpus.We identified three categories of sentences: 1)normal English sentences, like in Newswire text,2) normal biomedical English sentences ?
thosesentences which can be parsed without a problemby Link Grammar-, and 3) complex biomedicalEnglish sentences ?
those sentences which can?t beparsed by Link Grammar.
Aside from the knowncharacteristics mentioned before, sentences in thethird group tended to be longer (18% of them hadmore than 50 words, while only 8% of those ingroup 2 and 2% of those in group 1 did).
It hasbeen observed that parsers perform well with sen-tences of reduced length (Chandrasekar & Srini-vas, 1997; Siddharthan, 2006).In this paper, we explore the use of text simplifi-cation as a preprocessing step for general parsingto reduce length and complexity of biomedical sen-tences in order to enhance the performance of theparsers.2 MethodsThere are currently many publicly available corpo-ra of biomedical texts, the most popular amongthem being BioInfer, Genia, AImed, HPRD 50,IEPA, LLL and BioCreative1-PPI.
Among thesecorpora, BioInfer includes the most comprehensivecollection of sentences and careful annotation forlinks of natural parser, in both the Stanford andLink Grammar schemes.
Therefore, we chose theBioInfer corpus, version 1.1.0 (Pyysalo et al,2007), containing 1100 sentences for evaluatingthe effectiveness of our simplification method on177the performance of syntactic parsers.
The methodincludes syntactic and non-syntactic transforma-tions, detailed next.2.1 Non-syntactic transformationWe group here three steps of our approach: 1. pre-processing through removal of spurious phrases; 2.replacement of gene names; 3. replacement ofnoun phrases.To improve the correctness of the parsing, eachbiomedical sentence is first preprocessed to re-move phrases that are not essential to the sentence.This includes removal of section indicators, whichare phrases that specify the name of the section atthe beginning of the sentence, plus the removal ofphrases in parentheses (such as citations and num-bering in lists).
Also, partially hyphenated wordsare transformed by combining with the nearestword that follows or precedes the partial hyphe-nated word to make a meaningful word.
For in-stance, the phrase ?alpha- and beta-catenin?
istransformed into ?alpha-catenin and beta-catenin?.Occurrences of multi-word technical terms andentity names involved in biomedical processes arecommon in biomedical text.
Such terms are notlikely to appear in the dictionary of a parser (per-plexity is high), and will force it to use morpho-guessing and unknown word guessing.
This is timeconsuming and prone to error.
Thus, unlike typicaltext simplification that emphasizes syntactic trans-formation of sentences, our approach utilizes anamed entity recognition engine, BANNER(Leaman & Gonzalez, 2008), to replace multi-wordgene names with single-word placeholders.Replacement of gene names with single elementsis not enough, however, and grammatical category(i.e.
singular or plural) of the element has to beconsidered.
Lingpipe (Alias-i, 2006), a shallowparser for biomedical text, identifies noun phrasesand replaces them with single elements.
A singleelement is considered singular when the followingverb indicates a third-person singular verb or thedeterminer preceded by the element is either ?a?
or?an?.
Otherwise it is considered as plural and an?s?
is attached to the end of the element.2.2 Syntactic transformationThe problem of simplifying long sentences incommon English text has been studied before, not-ably by Chandrasekar & Srinivas (1997) and Sidd-harthan (2006).
However, the techniques used inthese studies might not totally solve the issue ofparsing biomedical sentences.
For example, usingSiddharthan?s approach, the biological finding?The Huntington's disease protein interacts withp53 and CREB-binding protein and represses tran-scription?, and assuming multi-word nouns such as?CREB-binding protein?
do not present a problem,would be simplified to:?The Huntington's disease protein interacts withp53.
The Huntington's disease protein interactswith CREB-binding protein.
The Huntington'sdisease protein represses transcription.
?Our method transforms it to ?GENE1 interactswith GENE2 and GENE3 and represses transcrip-tion.?
Both decrease the average sentence length,but the earlier distorts the biological meaning(since the Huntington?s disease protein might notrepress transcription on its own), while the lattersignifies it.While replacement of gene names and nounphrases can reduce the sentence length, there areFigure 1 ?
Linkages after simplification of the original sentence?
GENE1: human CREB binding protein?
GENE2: CBP?
GENE3s: CBP?
REPNP1s: RTS patientsOriginal sentence ST: The gene for the human CREB binding protein, the transcriptional coactivator CBP,is included in the RT1 cosmid, and mutations in CBP have recently been identified in RTS patients.ST1:ST2:c1c3 c4c2178cases when the sentences are still too complex tobe parsed efficiently.
We developed a simple algo-rithm that utilizes linkages (specific grammaticalrelationships between pairs of words in a sentence)of the Link Grammar parser (Sleator, 1998) andpunctuations for splitting sentences into clauses.An example in Figure 1 illustrates the main part ofthe algorithm.
Each linkage has a primary link typein CAPITAL followed by secondary link type inshort.
The intuition behind the algorithm is to try toidentify independent clauses from complex sen-tences.
The first step is to split the sentence ST intoclauses c1, c2, c3 and c4 based on commas.
c1 isparsed using the Link Grammar parser, but c1 can-not be a sentence as there is no ?S?
link in the lin-kage of c1.
c2 is then attached to c1 and the linkageof ?c1, c2?
does not contain a ?S?
link as well.
?c1,c2, c3.?
is recognized as a sentence, since the lin-kage contains an ?S?
link, indicating that it is asentence, as well as the linkage of c4.
So the algo-rithm returns two sentences ST1 and ST2 for ST.3 ResultsOur method has the greatest impact on the perfor-mance of Link Grammar (LG), which lies at thecore of BioLG (Pyysalo et al, 2006).
However, italso has a significant impact on the self-trainingbiomedical parser by McClosky & Charniak (CM),which is currently the best parser available forbiomedical text.3.1 Rudimentary statistics of the results of sim-plification: After the simplification algorithm wastested on the 1100 annotated sentences of the Bio-Infer corpus, there were 1159 simplified sentencesbecause of syntactic transformation (section 2.2).The number of words per sentence showed a sharpdrop of 20.4% from 27.0 to 21.5.
The Flesh-Kincaid score for readability dropped from 17.4 to14.2.
The Gunning Fog index also dropped by18.3% from 19.7 to 16.1.Pre-processingReplacementof gene namesReplacement ofnoun phrasesSyntacticSimplification359  1082  915  91Table 1: Sentences processed in each stage3.2 Impact of simplification on the efficiency ofparsing: We inputted the BioInfer corpus to LGand CM.
If LG cannot find a complete linkage, itinvokes its panic mode, where sentences are re-turned with considerably low accuracy.
Out of the1100 original sentences in the corpus, 219 wentinto panic mode.
After processing, only 39 out of1159 simplified sentences triggered panic mode (a16.4% improvement in efficiency).
The averagetime for parsing a sentence also dropped from 7.36secs to 1.70 secs after simplification.3.3 Impact of simplification on the accuracy ofparsing: Let ?g, ?o and ?s, respectively be thesets containing the links of the gold standard, theoutput generated by the parser on original sen-tences and the output generated by the parser onsimplified sentences.
We denote a link of type ?between the tokens ?1 and ?2 by (?,?1,?2).
In thecase of the original sentences, the tokens ?1and ?2are single-worded.
So, (?,?1,?2) is a true positiveiff (?,?1,?2) belongs to both ?g and ?o, false posi-tive iff it only belongs to ?o and false negative iffit only belongs to ?g.
In the case of simplified sen-tences, the tokens ?1and ?2 can have multiplewords.
So, (?,?1,?2) which belongs to ?s is a truepositive iff (?,??1,?
?2) belongs to ?g where ?
?1and ?
?2 are respectively one of the words in ?1 and?2.
Additionally, (?,?1,?2) which belongs to ?g isnot a false negative if ?1 and ?2 are parts of a sin-gle token of a simplified sentence.
For measuringthe performance of a parser, the nature of linkageis most relevant in the context of the sentence inconsideration.
So, we calculate precision and recallfor each sentence and average them over all sen-tences to get the respective precision and recall forthe collection.Precision Recall f-measureCM 77.94% 74.08% 75.96%BioSimplify +CM82.51% 75.51% 78.86%Improvement   4.57% 1.43% 2.90%LG 72.36% 71.65% 72.00%BioSimplify +LG78.30% 74.27% 76.23%Improvement   5.94% 2.62% 4.23%Table 2: Accuracy of McClosky & Charniak (CM) andLink Grammar (LG) parsers based on Stanford depen-dencies, with and without simplified sentences.In order to compare the effect of BioSimplify onthe two parsers, a converter from Link Grammar toStanford scheme was used (Pyysalo et al 2007:precision and recall of 98% and 96%).
Results of179this comparision are shown in Table 2.
On CM andLG, we were able to achieve a considerable im-provement in the f-measures by 2.90% and 4.23%respectively.
CM demonstrated an absolute errorreduction of 4.1% over its previous best on a dif-ferent test set.
Overall, bioSimplify leverages pars-ing of biomedical sentences, increasing both theefficiency and accuracy.4 Related workDuring the creation of BioInfer, noun phrase ma-cro-dependencies were determined using a simplerule set without parsing.
Some of the problems re-lated to parsing noun phrases were removed byreducing the number of words by more than 20%.BioLG enhances LG by expansion of lexicons andthe addition of morphological rules for biomedicaldomain.
Our work differs from BioLG not only inutilizing a gene name recognizer, a specializedshallow parser and syntactic transformation, butalso in creating a preprocessor that can improve theperformance of any parser on biomedical text.The idea of improving the performance of deepparsers through the integration of shallow and deepparsers has been reported in (Crysmann et al,2002; Daum et al, 2003; Frank et al, 2003) fornon-biomedical text.
In BioNLP, extraction sys-tems (Jang et al, 2006; Yakushiji et al, 2001) usedshallow parsers to enhance the performance ofdeep parsers.
However, there is a lack of evalua-tion of the correctness of the dependency parses,which is crucial to the correctness of the extractedsystems.
We not only evaluate the correctness ofthe links, but also go beyond the problem of rela-tionship extraction and empower future researchersin leveraging their parsers (and other extractionsystems) to get better results.5 Conclusion and Future workWe achieved an f-measure of 78.86% using CM onBioInfer Corpus which is a 2.90% absolute reduc-tion in error.
We achieved a 4.23% absolute reduc-tion in error using LG.
According to the measuresdescribed in section 3.1, the simplified sentencesof BioInfer outperform the original ones by morethan 18%.
Our method can also be used with otherparsers.
As future work, we will demonstrate theimpact of our simplification method on other textmining tasks, such as relationship extraction.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Science Foundation Arizona (awardCAA 0277-08 Gonzalez) for partly supporting thisresearch.
