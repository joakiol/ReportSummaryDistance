In our approach Web documents arerepresented as different sets of features orterms of different types (bag of words,URLs, names and numbers).
We apply Ag-glomerative Vector Space clustering thatuses the similarity between pairs of analo-gous feature sets.
This system achieved avalue of 66% for F?=0.2 and a value of 48%for F?=0.5 in the Web People Search Task atSemEval-2007 (Artiles et al, 2007).1 IntroductionName queries account for a substantial part of Webqueries in commercial search engines.
Name que-ries often aim at retrieving information about par-ticular persons.
Nevertheless, the same query ormention name usually recalls several people andthe user is unaware of the potential ambiguity andexpects to find the related person after skimmingsome results.Similar problems are also common for products,organizations and almost any other named objectin real world.
A related problem appears for differ-ent kinds of objects receiving the same name.
Forexample, Firebird can refer to a car, a guitar, a fic-tion superhero or a database product among morethan twenty different senses collected in Wikipe-dia.
In all these cases, the user could benefit from astructured representation that facilitates browsingresults.
Other applications like Question Answer-ing would also benefit from name disambiguationand person names disambiguation, in particular.
Inthis work we focus on the task of disambiguatingWeb pages retrieved for a person name query asproposed in the Web People Search Task at SemE-val-2007.2 Background and Related ResearchIn recent work in named entity disambiguation,Malin (2005) identifies two different dimensions toclassify approaches to the task depending on theinformation type that is used and whether themethod to train the system is supervised or unsu-pervised.
Regarding the information type, Malin(2006) identifies personal information like bio-graphical facts (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998; Mannand Yarowsky, 2003) or relational information(Bekkerman and McCallum, 05), collocations withother entities.Personal name disambiguation has been studiedin relation with citation analysis and record linkageand their use to improve Web search results haveattracted more interest recently (Guha and Garg2004; Bollegala, 2006), but it is evaluated only at asmall scale.
In contrast Bekkerman and McCallum(2005) have focused on disambiguating completesocial networks and not only results for one name.3 System descriptionWeb People Search proposes a task to find differ-ent people sharing the same name referred in a setof Web pages and associate each of these pages tothese people.
To solve the task we added two sim-plifying assumptions; each document refers only toone person, and every listed document refers to aperson.362Our approach is an unsupervised personal namedisambiguation system according to the classifica-tion proposed by Malin.
In this system the methodapplied to solve ambiguity consists of extractingfrom each document a set of features, that wecalled document context and afterwards to clusterthem according to their similarity3.1 Document representationIn this task we do not have structured informationto estimate similarity.
For this reason, the first stepof the system consists of extracting features fromthe documents.
Since our goal is to develop tech-niques that work for large amounts of documents,most of the features are based simply on words,HTML structure and simple patterns that aim tosubstitute more elaborated features based on in-formation extraction.
Features might not have adirect correspondence with facts that help to iden-tify a person like date of birth or telephone but, insome cases, dealing with them instead of withproper semantic information can be a good ap-proach.
On the other hand, some people features,as emails or related URLs, are detected throughsimple patterns.
Other simple patterns like num-bers can also provide information about some peo-ple features.All terms identified by the same pattern are rep-resented as a bag of terms.
Document context iscomposed of a set of bags, each containing all theterms of the document that were captured with afixed pattern.3.2 Types of ContextsThe bags of terms used in document contexts arethe following:a) emails, b) URLs, c) proper names, d) longnumbers (more than four figures), e) short numbers(up to four figures), f) title terms, g) terms of thetitles of related documents, h) terms contained inthe ?meta?
tag of the documents, i) terms of em-phasized text fragments (bold, italic, etc.
), j) termsof the document snippet, and k) terms of the re-lated documents snippets.The bags b, f, g, j, and k have been extractedfrom the data files provided (snippets, rank, etc.
),whereas a, c, d, e, h and i have been directly ex-tracted from result pages.From all the bags of terms, we finally selected tocompound the contexts b, c, d, e, f, g and j as in thetraining set they contributed to obtain the best re-sult.3.3 Term normalization and filteringEach extracted term is normalized, filtered andweighted before being added to a bag of terms.
Afilter for stopwords is applied to every bag ofwords and they are represented in lowercase.
Spu-rious HTML tags and terms under three charactersare also considered stopwords.
Bag of numbers arenormalized by removing blanks, hyphens and pa-renthesis.In addition to stopwords, terms with low fre-quency, lower than 0.2 times the frequency of themore frequent term of each bag of words, are notconsidered.
Finally the tf-idf value of every term isassociated.Proper names are extracted with a robust rulebased name recognizer based on surface featureand some trigger words.
It should be emphasizedthat over the bag of proper names, a filtering isimplemented to make the detection of co-referentsproper names easier when comparing different ar-rays.
In this way, a similarity measure amongproper names is considered (Camps and Daud?,2003) more flexible than the simple comparison oftheir strings of characters.
This approach toleratesthe omission, substitution or inclusion of words inthe proper name, the alteration in the order of thewords, or the substitution of words with initials, aswell as the omission, substitution or inclusion ofcharacters.
First, all proper names that are in theset of documents are identified, and all similarproper names according to these relaxed rules aregrouped by the same common term.
In this way,arrays of proper names are rewritten, referencingeach proper name through its common term andrecalculating its frequency.3.4 Clustering algorithmOur system uses Agglomerative Vector SpaceClustering to group and disambiguate pages.
Giventhe nature of the problem, it does not need to indi-cate the number of classes to be obtained in ad-vance.
To determine if two documents should beassigned to the same cluster, we evaluate the simi-larity between each pair of bags of terms and, later,it is determined how many of these pairs have asimilarity over a threshold.
For a document to be inthe same cluster we require a minimum number ofsimilar pairs.363In order to allow finer adjustments in the num-ber of similar pairs needed, instead of requiring Nsimilar pairs, the pairs are arranged in a decreasingorder according to the obtained similarity and it ischecked if the similarity of the nth pair is above orbelow the threshold.
In this case, interpolation canbe applied, so the number of necessary similarpairs is not limited to the natural numbers.
Thedeveloped system uses linear interpolation to cal-culate this function.We use the cosine vector similarity as similaritymeasurement.4 Results and EvaluationFor the evaluation the system has been adjustedwith a threshold of similarity of 0.001, 2.5 pairs ofbags of terms above the threshold required for in-cluding two documents in the same cluster and thefollowing bags of terms: bags of URLs, propernames, long and short numbers, terms of titles,terms of the titles of the related documents andterms of the document snippets.With this adjustment it is noticed that some prob-lems affect the results of the evaluation.
The mostimportant of these problems is the small number ofclusters in which pages are classified.
For instance,Mark Johnson refers to 70 different people in key,but our system classified his pages in only 14 clus-ters.
Due to this small number of clusters, eachcontains more than one person to search, but with agood recall of pages for each person.
Table 1shows the results obtained for the test set, where Pis the purity, R is the inverse purity, F?=0.5 repre-sents the harmonic mean of purity and inverse pu-rity, and F?=0.2 is the measure of F that considersmore important inverse purity than purity.Although at a first sight set 1 shows better re-sults than set 2 and 3, once we discard the peoplenames ?Sharon Goldwater?
and ?Dekang Lin?
(whose results are above the mean), results arevery similar for all groups.
We consider that oursystem behaves in a homogenous way regardlessof the proportion of the different types of namesthe sets are composed of: less frequent names (withlower ambiguity) and ?celebrity?
names (with peo-ple that dominate the set of pages).In the other hand, the assumptions considered tosolve the problem (each page references at leastone and only one person) were definitely too na?ve,as there is a lot of discarded pages (in some casesmore than 50% of the pages are not taken into ac-count) and some pages refer to several people.These facts also contribute to make lower purity.Table 1.

This causes a differenceof almost twenty points in the measures of F?=0.5and F?=0.2.
In order to correct this weakness, in thefuture we will consider that any person can bementioned in different pages, and that not all pagesreference to any of the people to search.Also we will perform additional experimentsregarding parameter tuning.
Although the numberof similar contexts considered in these experiments364is 1.5 (value that maximizes the measure of F),results show that this value causes larger groupsthan those found in search results.
Probably asmaller value for this parameter will divide pagesin more clusters, improving the purity of the result.Finally, we would like to consider differentmethods to select relevant terms.ReferencesA.
