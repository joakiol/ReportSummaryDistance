Formal redundancy and consistency checking rulesfor the lexical database WordNet TM 1.5Dietrich H. Fischer, GMD-IPSIAbstractIn a manually built-up semantic net in which notthe concept definitions automatically determinethe position of the concepts in the net, but ratherthe links coded by the lexicographers, the for-mal properties of the encoded attributes and re-lations provide necessary but not sufficient con-ditions to support maintenance of internal con-sistency and avoidance of redundancy.
Accord-ing to our experience the potential of this meth-odology has not yet been fully exploited ue tolack of understanding of applicable formalrules, or due to inflexibility of available soft-ware tools.
Based on a more comprehensive in-quiry performed on the lexical database Word-Net TM 1.5, this paper presents a selection ofpertinent checking rules and the results of theirapplication to WordNet 1.5.
Transferable in-sights are: 1.
Semantic relations which areclosely related but differing in a checkableproperty, should be differentiated.
2 Inferablerelations - such as the transitive closure of a hi-erarchical relation or semantic relations inducedby lexical ones - need to be taken into accountwhen checking real relations, i.e.
directly storedrelations.
3.
A semantic net needs proper epre-sentation of lexical gaps.
A disjunctive hy-pernym, implemented as a set of hypernyms, isconsidered harmful.I In t roduct ionWhen building large-scale lexical/semantic resources,subsequent - or better, simultaneous - validation of con-tent is essential.
Basic validation includes formal redun-dancy and consistency checks.
Taking WordNet 1.5 asan example, we illustrate the development and applica-tion of such rules.
The computational environment forthis enquiry is TerminologyFramework, an object-oriented generic tool developed to represent and consis-tently maintain concept-oriented dictionaries of differenttypes, including WordNet \[Fischer et al, 1996\].
Into thissystem, the content of WordNet 1.5 was downloadedfrom the "dict/data.
*"-files; some checks were per-formed during download as part of the operational se-mantics of our relation definitions, but most of thechecks were simulated a-posteriori by database queries.The main aim of the enquiry is not to produce an errorreport on WordNet 1.5, but to develop a methodology ofredundancy and consistency checks for re-use.
There-fore, not only WordNet 1.5 has been checked, but ourideas have been developed and checked for validity andrelevance using WordNet 1.5.
Compared to the thesauriwe had previously modeled and downloaded, WordNet1.5 offers a richer set of semantic and lexical relationswhich give rise to new questions of redundancy or con-sistency (cf.
\[Fischer, 1993\]).
The more relations intro-duced into a manually built up net, the more dependen-cies are created which hold each other in check; oncethey are explicated, formulated as guidelines and imple-mented, they can be used to support internal consistency- a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the cor-rectness of a semantic net.In the following - after having characterized in gen-eral the status of formal checks in semantic nets of theWordNet-type - we present and comment a series ofconstellations which shall give exemplary insight intothe topic.How to read the pictures in this paperAll pictures in this paper are snapshots from the screen,and clippings from a window of TerminologyFrame-work's graphical browser \[M6hr and Rostek, 1993\].
Theoriginal, and hence uncorrected WordNet 1.5 data isshown as a graph where a node may represent a concept(i.e.
synset, named by its first synset-element) or occa-sionally a term, i.e.
synset element linked to its conceptby the designation relation which is shown by its inversefrom the concept side and is thus labeled term.
Termsare represented in TerminologyFramework as uniqueobjects having the synset element word/phrase as theirpossibly homographic name, and a system-generated anmaintained homograph counter number which is storedseparated from the name string as another term attribute.A term node label is distinguished from a concept labelby a lowercase prefix indicating the part of speech(hence N for noun concepts / n for noun terms, V forverb concepts / v for verb terms).
A concept's label bodytakes its content from its first synset element which isalso transformed on download into a term with this label22body.
We do not present examples from the adjectivesand adverbs which are also contained in the database.2 Formal  checks  versus  checks  basedon concept  de f in i t ionsWe suggest hat Woods and Schmolze \[1992\] implicitlyalso critize semantic nets of the WordNet-type whenthey characterize "typical frame-based representationsystems" by stating that in these systems the semanticsof manually linking concepts by is-a or a-kmd-of rela-tions is "strictly operational - defined by how they workand what they cause to happen."
Then they continue:"There is no external criterion of correctness to whichthese decisions hould adhere" (p. 135).We wonder what would be an external criterion ofcorrectness even in a system of terminological logic, oris there a criterion which checks the adequacy of amanually supplied logic concept definition?
In any case,we would call the criteria which are based on the rea-soning of the system internal ones.
However, in theframework of a KL-ONE-type system they can be neces-sary and sufficient - relying on a set of undefined con-cepts, axioms, and a logic calculus - while in a manuallybuilt-up thesaurus or semantic net of the WordNet-typeonly necessary conditions of correctness can be checked.Note that Woods and Schmolze \[1992\] assume thatsomething "happens" when the lexicographer draws asemantic link; they do not criticize - as we do - thatsometimes nothing happens or not enough happenswhich differentiates this type of link from some other,except that they have different labels.
Then linkingwould be nothing but connecting nodes.
Our aim is todig out and apply rules which approximate the intendedsemantics of the links, or to populate the inventory ofthose checks which are based on formal properties of theused relations and attributes and their logical dependen-cies, thus constituting their operational semantics.
Theyare not based - as in a terminological logic system - onan "understanding" of the individual concept definitions.Therefore we call them formal.WordNet concept definitions are given by glosses innatural language - not referring explicitly to the net it-self, thus not making use of its disambiguated polysems.These glosses are attached to the concepts, but some-times they are not available and sometimes they areintermixed with or replaced by usage examples.
Checksmay be conceived which are based on an understandingof these definitions whether the reader of the glosses is ahuman reader or a program, based on linguistics.
How-ever, sometimes the glosses are faulty and the linkstructure is correct, and sometimes the contrary is true;thus they could hold each other in check, as long as theyare independent of each other.We continue these notes on formal versus contentbased checks at the end of this paper (see section 5) bypresenting three examples, contrasting both types ofchecks when we already have explicated the formal oneswe then can refer to.3 Checks  to avo id  redundancyFrom the results presented in the following, one caninfer that redundancy-free data was the aim of theWordNet lexicographers, but apparently if by insertionsredundant data was generated this occasionally wasmissed, if the redundant data was out of sight of thehuman checker or the checking program, i.e.
distant bysome hierarchical levels from the point of update.3.1 Short cuts in the generic hierarchyFigure 1 shows a short cut, spanning four levels of thehyponymy hierarchy from noun concept hptd to nounconcept riglycerzde.
Because of the transitivity of thegeneric hierarchy relation this link is redundantlystored in WordNet 1.5.
Note however, that the short cut,so obvious in this picture, will probably be hidden to theeye, even in a hierarchical line print-out, when all hypo-nyms of hpid, od \[2\], animal oil, and glycerlde wouldbe displayed.
The numbers of hyponyms from lipiddown to glycertde are 4, 32, 29 and 1 respectively.Note that '2'  in the label N. od \[2\] is the homographcounter number, generated by TerminologyFramework.This number need not be identical with the sense numbershown by WordNet's read-only browser.The database contained only 11 short cuts with respectto the hyponym / hypernym hierarchy for noun conceptsand 2 short cuts with respect to the troponym / tropony-mOf hierarchy for verb concepts.Note however, that the result of the redundancy checkis valid if and only if the premises are valid: If one ofthe non-redundant hyponym links is wrong, and has tobe removed the link diagnosed as redundant may becorrect and non-redundant.
For the cases of redundancymentioned here the premises apparently were correct.N: IIHYPON'YlVl'N: oll \[2\]1H~ON'CMN: animal odI~-rCPONVMN: glycendeHYPON"YIvlN: tngt31dIHYPONYMtcerldeFigure 1 A short cut in the generic noun hierarchy233.2 Are shor t  cuts  in the meronymich ie rarchy  redundanc ies?Short cuts in the meronymic hierarchy - as representedin Wordnet 1.5 by the semantic relations part/partOf,member/group, and ingredient/substance - have alsobeen supervised by the system on download.
73 shortcuts were detected, all in the part/partOf hierarchyHowever these can be judged a-priori to be redundanciesif and only if transitivity holds for the part/partOf rela-tion, and this depends on definitions (not given byWordNet) and actual usage.A preliminary result of our analysis is: 1.
The lexicog-raphers implicitly made heavy use of transitivity, other-wise the data would be highly incomplete; in otherwords, if transitivity of the partOf-relation had not beenpresupposed there should be many more short cuts.
2.By an occasional distorted use of the partOf-relationapplied to individual concepts transitivity was invali-dated; this pertains to cases of the type: "The Alps arepart of Yugoslavia; the Alps are part of France, ere .... "With respect to generic concepts (not individual ones, asthe Alps) there is also an acceptable xample of an im-plicit exclusive disjunctive partOf-value-set.
These dis-junctive partOf-value-sets invalidate transitivity andinheritance of meronymic relationships through genericrelationships.
These cases have to be singled out, sepa-rated into a special relationship or simply corrected byintroducing e.g.
the concept French Jlps etc.
; then forthe rest transitivity holds and short cut checking andchecking for redundancy by inheritance is meaningful.Meronymy in WordNet needs the space of anotherpaper, see also \[Bloksma et al, 1996\], and \[Prlss, 1996\].3.3 Redundancy  by imp l i ca t ion  o fd i f fe rent  semant ic  re la t ionsOn the class of verb concepts two semantic relations aredefined which are not logically independent: Troponymy(i.e.
hypernymy on verbs) and entailment.
Example: hmpis a troponym of (or a special way to perform) walk, andsnore is an entailment of sleep, if simulated snoring isnot snoring.
It is stated in Fellbaum's WordNet paper(\[Miller et al, 1993\]) that "Troponymy is a particularkind of entailment, in that every troponym V 1 of a moregeneral verb V2 also entails V2" (p. 47).Accordingly, the database does not include a verb V 1which is a direct troponym of a verb V2 and directlyentails V2, because the latter link would be redundant.However, because of the assumed transitivity of tro-ponymy, the database stores only direct troponym links(2 exceptions, ee above subsection 3.1), and taking thisinto account, the rule should be formulated more exphc-itly: If a verb concept V1 is a direct or indtrect tropo-nym of V2, then V1 entails V2.
As a formula: (V1 tro-ponymOf* V2) => (V1 entailment* V2).
(Here the staroperator designates the transitive closures of the rela-tions it is applied to.)
Hence the check must look fornon-empty overlaps of these two virtual relations.
Re-suit: The database included 15 redundant direct entail-ments; one is shown in Figure 2.Figure 2 also includes an overlap with redirect entail-ment (from massage \[2\] via rub \[1\] to touch \[7\]); thishowever vanishes if the redundant direct link (from rub\[1\] to touch \[7J) is removed, but what is to do, if thetroponym chain from manipulate \[2\] to rub \[1\] wouldnot exist in the database?
The constellation then wouldnot be tractable by automatic update.
The database in-eludes another three indirect redundant entailments ofthis type.With hindsight and foresight we are emphasizing thefollowing: The logic of the generic subsumption de-mands that every instance of a subeoncept is also aninstance of its superconcepts, otherwise the logic, sup-posed to be started from, is changed.
From this followsthat poly-hypernymy has to be treated with care: Multi-ple superconcepts o be implicitly combined by or(disjunction) and not by and (conjunction) invalidate"that every troponym V 1 of a more general verb V2 alsoentails V2" (see below Figure 12 and Figure 13).+ ,:V touch \[7\] 'rake physical- / ~ "~ : contnctwlth, come, ,~" \ Omss'-,.~Incontactwm: +" "rl~:tOPOltPa'~ \ "Touda.,he stone for, / + ~ ."

Therefore, if in addition x en-tails t, then x and t are equivalent, logically.
It followsthat - if such a constellation occurs, and the premises arevalid - the concepts t and x should be merged.The database contains exactly three constellations ofthe type in question.
They are shown in Figure 3 and inFigure 4 which contains two cases (the pair exhale \[1\] /breathe \[1\] and the pair inhale \[1\] / breathe l"1\]).24, ', r *; '  ,,,, .

The examples given then may be related to the phe-nomenon of synecdoche: According to the OED synec-doche is a rhetorical "figure by which a more compre-hensive term is used for a less comprehensive t rm andvice versa, a whole for a part or a part for a whole, genusfor species or species for genus".
While such a synecdo-chical use of designations, carefully applied in discoursedoes not lead to polysemy, it would lead to an absurdoverload of polysems in a dictionary, if the principlewould be transferred to it, even if reduced to inherttanceof designations, i.e.
top-down, not bottom up, and alongthe generic relation only.25' 'a tool with a sharp, point and euttJng edges* ' for making holes In hard materials (usually ''a motor-driven tool" .

However, the interactive check's actionpart should be a warning and not a roll back, otherwisethe system would exclude that polysems can be arrangedin a generic hierarchy as superconcept and subconcept.Fellbaum \[1996\] calls this an "Autorelation" (in Ger-man).
A good example from WordNet is the noun drinkin the sense of beverage (drmk\[2J),, and in the sense ofalcol~ohc beverage (drink \[3~.
However, what about theexample shown in Figure 6?Is the assignment of term drill as a synonym of elec-tric drdl avoidable redundancy leading to avoidablehomography, or not?
If not, why was drill not also asynonym of power drdl?
If yes or no, and even if weconfine ourselves to a synchronic view of language,what would be a working guideline which delineates theassumed good example drmk from the alleged not sogood one (Figure 6)?In the bilingual DUDEN OXFORD we find as a trans-lation of drill into German not only the general meaningBohrer (WordNet: drdl \[3\]), but also Bohrmaschme(WordNet: power drdl) in the context (Carpentry,Butldmg).
Given that the concept or meaning unit iscontext independent, his may bring to mind that notonly translation eeds context, but also synset member-ship.The database contains only 23 noun homographs se-lected by the mentioned check.
These homographs be-long to 21 pairs of noun concepts.
Five of them are sin-gled out due to the type of mistake which is shown be-low in Figure 15: A hyponym link has been coded wherea meronymic one would have been correct.
The corre-sponding number of verb homographs i 283, and theybelong to 336 pairs of verb concepts, among them fivecases which are synecdochical or auto-related triplets.A similar type of questionable synecdoche pertains tocases such as {drumhead, head}, a synset which is ahyponym of membrane, but also creates a new sense ofhead (total number of senses: 24).4 Consistency checks obtained forsemantic relations which are inducedby lexical relationsWhen asking for possible checks not yet performed forWordNet's term-term relations (lexical relations) webecame aware of their interference with the concept-concept relations (semantic relations).
This enquiry iswell supported in TerminologyFramework by its easy-to-handle facility to define virtual (i.e.
inferable or comput-able) relations on top of real or virtual relations.4.1  Exc lus iv i ty  o f  hypernymy andantosemyThe WordNet antonymy relation is a lexical relation, i.e.a relation between synset elements of different synsets\[Miller et aL, 1993\].
Therefore it was modeled in Ter-minologyFramework as a term-term.relation.
With re-gards to concepts, two concepts can be defined to beopposed if at least two of their terms are antonyms.TerminologyFramework implements the opposed rela-tion (synonymously: antosemy) as a vtrtual, i.e.
comput-able concept-concept relation (see Fischer et al 1996).We say that the semantic relation antosemy is mdueedbythe lexical relation antonymy.Antosemy relationships and hypernymy or hyponymyrelationships are exclusive to each other, i.e.
both rela-tionships cannot hold in conjunction between any pair ofconcepts.
This rule may be based on the feature model ofconcepts: If we assume a concept representation by fea-tures, then hypernymy entails inclusion of all features ofthe superconcept, and this cannot be compatible with anantosemy between superconcept and subconcept, whichmay, for example, be based on a meta-antosemy relationbetween features.For a cheek of this rule the overlap of two virtual re-lations has to be determined: antosemy and the transitiveclosure of hypernymy or troponymy.
The number ofantosemy relationships i about 800 for nouns, and about500 for verbs; there was no overlap with direct or indi-rect hypernymy, and in only two cases there was a non-empty overlap with indirect roponymy.
These two vio-lations of the exclusion rule are shown in Figure 7.Note that there is no overlap with direct troponymy,but with indirect or inferable troponymy.
What is wrongwith this counter-example?
The troponym link fromprove \[1\] to negate l"1\] is an error, and it may have itsorigin in a fallacy: To prove by negation is a troponymof to prove, but this is different from to negate in thesense of to show to be false.
In other words, one mayprove A by showing that the negatton of A is false, butthe point is, that the negation of A is another object hanA, i.e.
the object to be proved has changed, and indeed,it cannot reasonably be maintained that to negate A is aspecial way to prove A26The two violations of the exclusion rule Figure 74.2 About binary and n-ary (n > 2)antonymy and antosemy in WordNetWordNet 1.5 permits cardinality > 1 for antonymy, how-ever a cardinality check of antonymy is blind with re-spect to fundamental semantic differences of which thecardinality check for the induced relation, the antosemyrelation, is more sensitive.
We explain this by the fol-lowing examples from,WordNet 1.5:The verb term trust \[1\]is an antonym of the verb terramistrust and of the verb term distrust \[1\], and both - asvariants - are synonyms of each other.
Thus, the cardi-nality of the antonym set of trust \[1\] is 2.
However,because these two antonyms are synonyms, the value setof the induced antosemy relation of the concept belong-ing to trust \[1\] has cardinality I.
Therefore we say thattrust \[I\] has no genuine multi-value antonymy or, syn-onymously, it has binary antonymy - although its anto-nym set has cardinality 2.On the other hand, there are cases (one is presented inFigure 8 below) where the induced relationship has car-dinality 2 and the basic antonym relationship has cardi-nality 2: In Figure 8 the term ~,.
artse \[3\] has genuinemulti-value antonymy or (in this case) ternary anton-ymy.
However, not all cases of cardinality 2 of antosemyare caused by deliberate ternary antonymy.
Cardinality 2may also be caused by an error of a type we try to de-scribe in the next subsection.
WordNet does not differ-entiate between binary and n-ary opposition (n > 2), or,basically, between binary and n-ary antonymy (n > 2),and due to this implicit merging of relations, the lexi-cographers intentions cannot be automatically checkedby a simple cardinality test for antosemy; i.e.
we do notknow which of the cases of cardinality 2 of antosemy areinconsistent or not.
The comparatively ow number ofthese cases (about 200, but only 40 for nouns and verbs)allows for intellectual perusal.~,,,~',..~lJ~slt\[4\] ~'-~.~"l'~ ~'~'.7,="- ~1 ~,"~ ' - ' "  ," ~v:.ller41 ~:Fngure 8 An interesting vmlation oftransitiwtyHowever, if n-ary antonymy is admitted the law of tran-sitivity is at stake.
We singled out all cases where thetransitivity rule for antosemy was not fulfilled, resultingin 29 connection components or 85 involved concepts.All these constellations seem to need correction.
Thecorrections we would suggest are: Cutting of an antonymlink, or a merging or a splitting of concepts, and allthese cases belong to the type characterized in the nextsubsection.
There was just one case, shown in Figure 8,where we first thought hat an antonym link was forgot-ten (between v: sit down \[2\] and v' he down ), and thiswas caused by the fact that the database contains thefollowing transitive complete group: he \[2\], stt \[1\],stand \[3\] are antonyms of each other (see Figure 13).Coming across other perhaps more harmful cases (seebelow Figure 12 and Figure 13) of a concept which is tobe represented as a disjunction of concepts and itself alexical gap, we now suggest hat the constellation ofFigure 8 was intended to say: arzse \[3\] is an antosem ofthe one concept sit down \[2\] or he down.
However, ifthis single-valued binary relationship is split here intotwo binary ones linked to the components of the dis-junction, then all antonym value sets must be interpretedas disjunctmns, and transitivity need not hold for n-aryantosemy with n > 2.
On the other hand, the antonymvalue set of trust \[1\] is to be interpreted as a conjunc-tion.
If the example of Figure 8 is interpreted in this27way, we also loose simple symmetry of antosemy: Fromthe mere fact that the antosem of stt down \[2\] is artse\[3\] one can no longer infer that the antosem of arise \[3\]is sit down \[2\]4.3  Commutat iv i ty  o f  synonymy andantonymy is equ iva lent  to max imalcard ina l i ty  1 fo r  antosemytFzgure 9 A case which qualifies as a wolatmn of transitivityof antosemy.Was the constellation shown in Figure 9 intended asternary antosemy?
Is the case equivalent to Figure 8?
Wedo not think so, and this may be backed also by the fact(not shown in this figure) that V. sedate is a top conceptwhile V" de-energize is not.
The constellation shown inFigure 9 may be characterized by another law which ispertinent here if we may assume that binary antosemywas intended.
It is an abstraction from one possible cor-rection of the constellation: The antonyms of the syno-nyms v: energue and v: smnulate \[1\] should be syno-nyms, i.e.v, de-energize and v: sedate should be syno-nyms, and in order to achieve that, the concepts V. de-energtze and V sedate need to be merged.Abstracting, the rule postulated for binary antonymyis: For each set of synonyms S the set of antonyms of theelements of S must again be a set of synonyms or it isempty.
By "a set of synonyms" we mean a set of ele-ments which are defined as synonyms.
I f  we would in-terpret "a set of synonyms" as a synset then the rulereads: For each synset S the set of the antonyms of theelements of S must be a Subset of another synset, thesubset may even be empty or be the whole synset.
Trans-forming the rule into a formula, would help to better seethat the rule is a kind of law of commutativity betweenantonymy and synonymy.
Another paraphrase of thisrule is that binary antonymy is a structure-preserving orhomomorphic mapping with respect to synonymy.There is a simple checking rule for this because therule is equivalent to maximal cardinality 1 of antosemy.However, this would help for future checking only ifWordNet is modified and updated so that binary and n-ary (n >2) antonymy would be different lexical relations.Note that the value sets of binary antonymy need nothave maximal cardinality 1, although this is true forbinary antosemy.4.4 Commutat iv i ty  o f  antosemy andhypernymy / t roponymyThe commutativity rule for antosemy and hypernymy ortroponymy - as a heuristw rule - has already been sug-gested by Fischer et al It may be justified by featureinheritance.
Formally the heuristic rule of commutativitystates: For each concept c: I f  antosem(c) is not empty,then the equation hypernyrn (antosem(c)) = antosem(hypernym(c)) or set inclusion in one direction or theother should hold.
Applying the rule on the WordNetdata has resulted in 91 noun concept and 260 verb con-cepts fulfilling neither strong (equality) nor weak (setinclusion) commutativity.
These cases have not yet beenevaluated by a native speaker, but we suggest hat theydeserve revision.
An example is shown in Figure 10.'

Althoughthe gloss says that smuggle is a troponym of t ransport ,we may perhaps redefine: "export or import illegally".However, if someone is smuggling it cannot be inferredthat he is exporting illegally, nor that he is importingillegally, only the disjunction can be inferred.

The database contains558 noun and only 25 verb concepts with more than onedirect superconcept.
Among them, of course, also thosefound by the short cut check (see subsection 3.1), andfor them the value set of superconcepts implicitly is aconjunction.
Apparently this was aimed at for all nouns,but we saw a case where the hypernym relation implic-itly was substituted by ts -used- for  and this made up anor.
For the verbs we see far more ands than ors, amongthe latter also undifferentiated verbs which are tropo-nyms, e.g.
of both change \ [1 \ ]  ("undergo a change") andof change \ [3 \ ]  ("cause to change"); el.

How-ever, reading the gloss of N. employer the human reader(or the program analysing the gloss) may infer that thesuperconcepts need revision: The gloss logically de-mands the existence of a concept person or firm whichdoes not exist in the database, although Fellbaum \[1996\]argues to consider lexical gaps; however, if one wouldpropose that an add+tional hypernym link to N. firmmight help, that would be an error of the type discussedin subsection 4.5.
Another unfortunate decision wouldbe to create two polysems: 1.
An employer who is per-son, 2. an employer who is a firm.
Bloksma et alcriti-cized that WordNet practice.The second example, shown in Figure 15, was amongthe 21 noun pairs which were retrieved by the check forgeneric synecdoche or generic auto-relationship.
Thistopic was treated above, see subsection 3.5.
The conceptpair we present here is satmwood \[1\] and satinwood \[2\],linked by a hyponym link.
Because supereoncept andsubconcept are both designated by the same word, thuscreating homography, they were detected by the checkwhich relates to generic synecdoche.
However, this ex-ample is neither a case of generic auto-relationship noris it a case of avoidable generic synecdoche: The hypo-nym link between satinwood \[1\] and satmwood \[2\] mustbe replaced by a substance link, also available in Word-Net.
No formal check could prevent he lexicographer toselect he wrong link type unless the synecdoche checkerwould lie in wait and catch this special case because ofname equality.
Asking for a check which would be ade-quate in more generality, we draw the reader's attentmnto the two superconcept chains which - before they endup in a common ancestor - are headed by hfe form andobject \[1\], in the sense of the negation of life form (seeglosses).
Assuming that there exist entities which haveaspects of a life form as well as aspects of not being alife form, we may be interested whether WordNet re-fleets this non-Boolean logic view.
In fact, in Wordnet1.5 we find 15,087 subconcepts of object \[1\], and13,806 subconcepts of ltfeform, and only 6 concepts inthe overlap, among them, of course satmwood \[2\].
In 4of these 6 cases the same error occurred, and in the other2 cases the hyponym link was mistaken for a memberlink, also available in WordNet.
WordNet does not en-code plain logical incompatibility, to express disjoint-ness of hierarchies, but what about antosemy?
Was it bychance that life form did not get the term ammate objectwhich then might associate the used term mammateobject as an antonym?
Then we would be led back to thecheck of subsection 4.5: May antosems share hyponyms?. '

which of these do not have sub-concepts themselves.
With respect o this check the tro-ponymy hierarchy of WordNet's verb concepts has 57330top verbs, however it is surprising to find that 236 ofthem are isolated.
Now, we already have reached thelimits of formal checking because formal checking can-not tell us whether all this was intended or is acceptable,and if not, what to do.
A human reader of the glossesmay infer that this or that top concept should be sub-sumed under a more general one, or may have alreadyexisting or not existing subconeepts.6 ConclusionTo our knowledge, the WordNet lexicographers were notsupported by dynamic checking on update, or by aneasy-to-use database query language for batch-checking,nor by a graphical browser/editor for visual feedback.WordNet's database set-up program, the "grinder", ob-viously controls consistency, however we are not in-formed about this.
According to TerminologyFrame-work's error report on download, the "grinder" did notfaultlessly perform range-checking because it allowed afew semantic (synset-to-synset) pointers where theyshould be lexical ones (synset-element to synset-element), and in very few cases it missed that a synset-element should not be an antonym of itself (irreflexivityof antonymy), and that a synset should not be a hypo-nym of itself (irreflexivity, as an entailment of aeyely-city of the generic relation).
Beyond these few slips wefound more interesting examples of errors or of redun-dancies which were not detected by chance, but by trig-gers (created by TerminologyFramework from the speci-fication of the operational semantics of the relations) ormostly by queries to the database, guided by our meth-odological interest.A practical lesson is that the design of dictionary rela-tions should be such that they are tractable by formalchecking, and this is severely impeded if different rela-tions are merged of which one has the checkable prop-erty p and another lacks it; the merged relation has thenlost the checkable property p. Examples from WordNet1.5 are meronymy (which is treated in this paper only bya short note) and antonymy.
Another point we had tostruggle with was WordNet's treatment of disjunctivehypernyms, especially when they are lexical gaps.
Thetopic of implicit logical junctors in value sets of Word-Net's generic and meronymic relations was also treatedby Bloksma et al, but the therapy they propose we couldnot get to like.This paper does not contain a complete list of check-ing rules for WordNet 1.5: Whenever we tried to evalu-ate a rule we got hints for another rule, and we have notyet taken into account all WordNet relations and attrib-utes.
Of course, there are important and less importantrelations, but note, if one takes only the important ones,or the most important relation, the generic relation, thenformal checking in this type of semantic net is very lim-ited.
In any case, formal checking is only a kind of syn-tax checking, the next step after spelling checking, but100 new pennies will make up an Euro.
Some of ourconcrete diagnoses may be wrong, or fall short, or be-come obsolete by a new release, but the questions to beposed for this type of semantic net remain.AcknowledgmentsI am indebted to Melina Alexa and John Bateman forencouraging this work, and to them both and WiebkeMt~hr, Renato Reinau, Lothar Rostek, and IngridSchmidt for valuable help to improve this paper.References\[Bloksma et al, 1996\] Laura Bloksma, Pedro Luis Dlez-Orzas, and Pick Vossen.
